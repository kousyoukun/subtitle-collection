00:00:30,223 --> 00:00:33,977
# Is it me, for a moment...

2
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:50,952
# Love

3
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:55,039
# Reign o'er me

4
00:00:59,669 --> 00:01:02,797
# Bell boy

5
00:01:08,428 --> 00:01:11,931
# Can you see
the real me, can you?

6
00:01:20,982 --> 00:01:25,987
# I went back to the doctor,
to get another shrink

7
00:01:26,446 --> 00:01:29,908
# I sit and tell him
about my weekend... #

8
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:31,910
Darlin'! Whey!

9
00:01:33,036 --> 00:01:34,037
# Whoo!

10
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,583
# Can you see the real me,
Doctor?

11
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:39,667
# Doctor?

12
00:01:40,418 --> 00:01:45,131
# Can you see
the real me, Doctor?

13
00:01:45,215 --> 00:01:47,801
# Whoa, Doctor!

14
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:55,517
# I went back to my mother

15
00:01:55,642 --> 00:01:58,394
# I said I'm crazy, Ma, help me!

16
00:01:59,062 --> 00:02:02,232
# She said,
I know how it feels, son

17
00:02:02,315 --> 00:02:04,526
# 'Cos it runs in the family

18
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,156
# Can you see the real me,
Mother?

19
00:02:10,657 --> 00:02:11,699
# Mother?

20
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:16,830
# Can you see the real me,
Mother?

21
00:02:17,247 --> 00:02:19,666
# Whoa, please!

22
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:23,002
# Can you see,
can you see the real me?

23
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:25,713
# The real me, the real me

24
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:29,300
# Can you see the real me,
Preacher?

25
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:31,302
# Preacher...

26
00:02:33,513 --> 00:02:34,514
Fuck off!

27
00:02:36,057 --> 00:02:37,725
Bollocks! Fuck off!

28
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:40,228
Why don't you get off and push?

29
00:02:44,858 --> 00:02:49,070
# Can you see?
Can you see? Can you see?

30
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:50,989
# Whoa!

31
00:02:51,072 --> 00:02:55,243
# Can you see the real me,
Doctor?

32
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:00,623
# Can you see the real me

33
00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:03,710
# Mother!

34
00:03:17,432 --> 00:03:19,934
'Ere, Ferdy. Ferdy.

35
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:22,479
Say, 'ello, Jim.
How's it goin', eh?

36
00:03:22,604 --> 00:03:24,314
All right.

37
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:30,737
'Ere, you got
something nice for me?

38
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,905
Shh!

39
00:03:33,031 --> 00:03:34,240
At your service, friend.

40
00:03:34,324 --> 00:03:35,950
They keep your brains warm?

41
00:03:36,034 --> 00:03:37,452
How many d'you want?

42
00:03:37,535 --> 00:03:38,995
Well, come 'ere.

43
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:41,790
I want about a dozen.

44
00:03:41,873 --> 00:03:43,166
Fuck off, Jim.

45
00:03:43,249 --> 00:03:45,794
All right, 20. But how much?

46
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:47,504
They're pretty scarce right now.

47
00:03:47,587 --> 00:03:49,422
I went abroad to get these.

48
00:03:49,506 --> 00:03:52,675
Got on a banana boat
back to Jamaica, did you?

49
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,843
No. Brixton.

50
00:03:53,927 --> 00:03:56,387
And as you know, Jim,
it costs money.

51
00:03:56,554 --> 00:03:58,473
All right, all right. How much?

52
00:03:58,556 --> 00:03:59,974
Quid.

53
00:04:00,058 --> 00:04:01,768
You're a fuckin' liberty-taker.

54
00:04:20,703 --> 00:04:22,122
Oi! Ferdy!

55
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,335
- Hello, lovers!
- Hi, Monkey!

56
00:04:48,231 --> 00:04:50,692
Go on, get in there!
She won't bite.

57
00:04:53,862 --> 00:04:55,780
'Cos if you don't, I might!

58
00:04:55,864 --> 00:04:58,408
- No, I'm not bothered.
- Not much.

59
00:04:59,492 --> 00:05:01,411
I know, I'll ask for you.

60
00:05:01,494 --> 00:05:03,204
- No, you won't.
- Oi, Steph!

61
00:05:03,288 --> 00:05:04,873
Fuck off!

62
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:23,224
# Now, you know, you know
you're gonna knock 'em dead #

63
00:05:46,456 --> 00:05:48,792
# I love the way you walk

64
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:51,461
# I'm crazy 'bout your walk

65
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:54,798
# I love the way you walk

66
00:05:55,673 --> 00:05:57,884
# I love the way you walk

67
00:05:57,967 --> 00:05:59,719
# You're my baby... #

68
00:06:16,236 --> 00:06:18,530
Pack it up. Don't do that.

69
00:06:18,655 --> 00:06:21,282
- Why not?
- Just go to sleep.

70
00:06:21,366 --> 00:06:23,618
I always do. I'm fed up with it.

71
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,919
Here, Yvonne.
You got any scissors?

72
00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:34,796
Under the table.

73
00:06:39,551 --> 00:06:41,678
Oh, what you done?

74
00:06:41,761 --> 00:06:44,681
Dunno what I done.
I can't see, can I?

75
00:06:44,764 --> 00:06:48,184
It's only some nail varnish.
I'll clean it up tomorrow.

76
00:06:48,268 --> 00:06:50,270
You're so bleedin' clumsy.

77
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:53,940
'Ere, you wanna watch it,
you know.

78
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:58,445
One day you'll come from under
there with first degree burns.

79
00:07:00,155 --> 00:07:02,073
It happened to my mate's sister.

80
00:07:02,157 --> 00:07:03,700
Oh, piss off.

81
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:25,221
# Why should I care

82
00:07:25,305 --> 00:07:28,850
# If I have to cut my hair?

83
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:32,520
# I got to move with the fashion

84
00:07:32,604 --> 00:07:34,898
# Or be outcast

85
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:39,652
# I know I should fight

86
00:07:39,736 --> 00:07:43,156
# But my old man
is nearly all right

87
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:46,493
# And I'm still living in hope

88
00:07:46,576 --> 00:07:49,162
# Even though it won't last

89
00:07:51,164 --> 00:07:52,248
# Zoot suit!

90
00:07:52,332 --> 00:07:54,709
# White jacket with side-vents

91
00:07:54,793 --> 00:07:56,836
# Five inches long

92
00:07:57,921 --> 00:08:00,965
# I'm out on the street again

93
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:03,885
# And I'm leaping along

94
00:08:05,094 --> 00:08:07,847
# Dressed right,
for a beach fight

95
00:08:07,931 --> 00:08:10,809
# But I just can't explain

96
00:08:10,892 --> 00:08:14,771
# Why that uncertain feelin'

97
00:08:14,854 --> 00:08:18,858
# Is still here in my brain #

98
00:08:32,497 --> 00:08:36,417
# Well, be-bop-a-lula

99
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:39,003
# She's my baby

100
00:08:39,087 --> 00:08:43,007
# Be-bop-a-lula,
I don't mean maybe...

101
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:45,426
Oi! Will you leave
that out, please?

102
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:47,387
Do what?

103
00:08:47,971 --> 00:08:50,765
Er, don't sing all that
old rubbish, eh?

104
00:08:52,225 --> 00:08:55,353
That ain't rubbish, pal!
That's Gene Vincent, all right?

105
00:08:55,437 --> 00:08:58,064
That's what I said. Old rubbish.

106
00:08:58,523 --> 00:09:02,944
Why don't you just turn over and
do a few underwater farts, eh?

107
00:09:04,112 --> 00:09:05,989
Why don't you just fuck off?

108
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:07,949
You fuck off.

109
00:09:08,032 --> 00:09:11,035
# Well, be-bop-a-lula

110
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:13,288
# She's my baby...

111
00:09:13,371 --> 00:09:15,915
# Da-da da-doo! Do-do do-doo!

112
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,378
- # Yeah, you really got me
- # Be-bop a-lula...

113
00:09:20,462 --> 00:09:22,964
# ..Don't know what I'm doin',
really got me...

114
00:09:23,047 --> 00:09:25,049
- # Yeah! You really got me
- # Be-bop-a-lula!

115
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:28,219
- # You got me so...
- # Don't mean maybe...

116
00:09:28,303 --> 00:09:31,556
What are you? Couple o' fairies?

117
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:38,605
All right, all right.
Cut it out!

118
00:09:38,688 --> 00:09:41,900
What d'you think this is? The
bloody Eurovision Song Contest?

119
00:09:52,952 --> 00:09:53,953
Ahh!

120
00:09:54,621 --> 00:09:56,706
Right, I'll sort you out.

121
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,709
Look! If you wanna start,
I'll see you outside...

122
00:10:00,335 --> 00:10:02,212
- Fuck me.
- Kevin Herriot?

123
00:10:02,295 --> 00:10:03,296
Jimmy.

124
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:05,965
Yeah, yeah.
I thought you was in the army?

125
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:07,759
No, I got out. You?

126
00:10:07,842 --> 00:10:09,135
I'm all right, yeah.

127
00:10:09,219 --> 00:10:11,721
The army didn't teach
you singing, did it?

128
00:10:11,805 --> 00:10:13,640
Nah. Give me my brush back?

129
00:10:19,437 --> 00:10:21,397
'Ere, pile the liquor on, mate.

130
00:10:25,902 --> 00:10:27,278
Two'n'eight.

131
00:10:27,403 --> 00:10:28,404
Cheers.

132
00:10:50,677 --> 00:10:51,928
Hello, Jim.

133
00:10:55,473 --> 00:10:57,350
What's the matter
with you, then?

134
00:10:57,434 --> 00:10:59,894
That gear you've got on,
it's leather.

135
00:10:59,978 --> 00:11:02,272
That's it.
Goes with the bike, dunnit?

136
00:11:03,022 --> 00:11:04,649
I never realised.

137
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:06,568
You never realised what?

138
00:11:06,693 --> 00:11:08,528
Well, you was...a rocker.

139
00:11:09,154 --> 00:11:10,238
What am I, black?

140
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,533
You ain't white
in that get-up, are you?

141
00:11:13,658 --> 00:11:15,118
Nah.

142
00:11:15,452 --> 00:11:17,454
Give us a cuppa tea, mate.

143
00:11:18,163 --> 00:11:20,290
Anyway, how long you been back?

144
00:11:20,498 --> 00:11:22,250
Coupla months ago.

145
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:24,752
Couldn't stick it, eh?

146
00:11:24,836 --> 00:11:27,505
Nah, they messed me about,
didn't they?

147
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:29,466
They treat you like shit.

148
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:32,510
Some poncey Sergeant Major's
always ordering you about.

149
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:35,597
"Don't do this, don't do that."
Drove me fuckin' mad.

150
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,140
Then ship you to Wogland.

151
00:11:37,223 --> 00:11:38,433
Whereabouts?

152
00:11:38,516 --> 00:11:39,851
Aden.

153
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:41,895
Was all right, as it 'appens.

154
00:11:41,978 --> 00:11:44,981
Shooting matches
with the rebels and all that.

155
00:11:45,064 --> 00:11:46,274
But they stopped that.

156
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:48,485
- Ship you home.
- You're joking!

157
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,653
Back to the same boring routine.

158
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:53,615
- Drove me fuckin' mad...
- Gotta go, Kev.

159
00:11:53,698 --> 00:11:55,992
- Where you goin'?
- See you later.

160
00:11:56,075 --> 00:11:58,203
- All right?
- Yeah, fine, John.

161
00:11:58,286 --> 00:12:00,163
What's this fuckin'
rocker doin' here?

162
00:12:01,831 --> 00:12:02,916
Jim?

163
00:12:04,584 --> 00:12:05,835
Here's your towel.

164
00:12:08,588 --> 00:12:09,839
See you later, Kev!

165
00:12:10,298 --> 00:12:11,508
Bollocks.

166
00:12:15,762 --> 00:12:17,972
- How does that feel?
- Awkward.

167
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:20,433
- What?
- Bring it in 'ere.

168
00:12:20,517 --> 00:12:23,103
- I could bring it...
- All right, Dan?

169
00:12:23,186 --> 00:12:25,980
- All right, Jim.
- Put your hands there.

170
00:12:26,064 --> 00:12:27,440
Stop fuckin' about!

171
00:12:27,524 --> 00:12:29,567
Don't use that
language here, sonny.

172
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:32,445
Talk like that you can
make your own suit.

173
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,280
There you go.

174
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:36,533
30 shillings, please.

175
00:12:36,658 --> 00:12:37,826
I'll bring that in.

176
00:12:37,951 --> 00:12:38,952
What about this?

177
00:12:39,035 --> 00:12:41,121
I want it by Saturday.

178
00:12:41,204 --> 00:12:42,997
Saturday. Yeah, Saturday.

179
00:12:43,081 --> 00:12:46,042
- What d'you think?
- Rent-a-tent, innit?

180
00:12:49,337 --> 00:12:51,381
Two pound nine pence, please.

181
00:12:51,464 --> 00:12:53,925
- Don't matter.

182
00:13:00,515 --> 00:13:01,516
All right, darlin'?

183
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,101
Saturdays, I hate 'em.

184
00:13:03,184 --> 00:13:06,104
I thought I'd just
drop by and say hello.

185
00:13:06,187 --> 00:13:07,897
Been up to no good?

186
00:13:07,981 --> 00:13:10,859
Not really.
Just paid me suit off.

187
00:13:10,942 --> 00:13:13,194
- Yeah? What's it like?
- Handsome.

188
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:16,322
Three buttons, side vents.
16" bottoms.

189
00:13:16,448 --> 00:13:17,407
Dark brown.

190
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:21,202
Have I got to wait
all day while you finish?

191
00:13:21,286 --> 00:13:23,455
I'm wearin' it down to Brighton.

192
00:13:23,538 --> 00:13:26,458
Gonna be one of the faces there,
are you?

193
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:30,295
What d'you mean "going to be"?
I am one of the faces.

194
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:37,510
# I'm the hippiest
number in town

195
00:13:37,594 --> 00:13:39,262
# And I tell you why

196
00:13:41,181 --> 00:13:45,143
# I'm the snappiest dresser
right down to my inch-wide tie

197
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:48,938
# And I'll get you wise

198
00:13:49,022 --> 00:13:51,816
# I'll explain to you

199
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:57,322
# A few of the things
that a face is supposed to do #

200
00:13:59,616 --> 00:14:01,659
That Bombers?
Give us a couple.

201
00:14:01,743 --> 00:14:04,287
Chalky! The Ponce,
he's about again.

202
00:14:04,412 --> 00:14:07,540
Not a tight-arse, are you?
I ain't had one for days.

203
00:14:07,624 --> 00:14:10,543
Why? You get banged up
in Margate or something?

204
00:14:10,627 --> 00:14:12,128
Banged up in Shepherd's Bush.

205
00:14:12,212 --> 00:14:14,839
My old man ain't let me out
since Margate.

206
00:14:14,923 --> 00:14:16,508
Even padlocked
the scooter, right?

207
00:14:16,591 --> 00:14:19,344
I went round,
he tried to do me over.

208
00:14:19,427 --> 00:14:21,513
I wouldn't stand for it.

209
00:14:21,596 --> 00:14:24,265
If my old man
took them sort of liberties,

210
00:14:24,349 --> 00:14:26,017
I'd fuckin' do him.

211
00:14:26,101 --> 00:14:28,436
You seen his dad? He's 6'2".

212
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,230
How come you're so small?

213
00:14:30,313 --> 00:14:32,190
- Dunno, it's... thingy...
- Genetic.

214
00:14:32,273 --> 00:14:33,483
His nan's a midget.

215
00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:35,485
There's a party
down Kitchener Road.

216
00:14:35,568 --> 00:14:37,737
- Told you.
- That posh bird?

217
00:14:37,862 --> 00:14:39,948
- Yeah. Right goer.
- One with...?

218
00:14:48,206 --> 00:14:50,583
Wanna go to a party?
Everybody's going.

219
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,377
- Where?
- Kitchener Road.

220
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,628
Yeah?

221
00:14:53,711 --> 00:14:56,965
It only takes 20 minutes
to get there by scooter.

222
00:14:57,048 --> 00:14:58,758
Where you off to, then?

223
00:14:58,842 --> 00:15:00,218
I'll see you later.

224
00:15:00,301 --> 00:15:01,469
Come on, Jim.

225
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:13,523
Ferdy!

226
00:15:14,232 --> 00:15:16,609
This is the place, lads.
Come on!

227
00:15:17,777 --> 00:15:18,903
All right, John?

228
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:22,282
Yeah, straight in, no problem.
Come on!

229
00:15:33,543 --> 00:15:34,836
No gate-crashers.

230
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:37,297
Gate-crashers? Lads, he's
callin' us gatecrashers.

231
00:15:38,715 --> 00:15:40,341
You didn't even
bring any bottles!

232
00:15:41,134 --> 00:15:44,179
Who the fuck are you?
Bleedin' Prince Philip?

233
00:15:44,262 --> 00:15:46,014
I'm the boyfriend
of the hostess.

234
00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:54,314
Listen, it's Sandra's party,
and me and me mates are invited.

235
00:15:54,397 --> 00:15:55,815
Sandra?

236
00:15:58,109 --> 00:15:59,986
'Ere, where'd you
get that shirt?

237
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:04,616
All right, Jim?

238
00:16:06,117 --> 00:16:07,660
Anything you fancy?

239
00:16:07,744 --> 00:16:10,121
There's nothing there.
You found a bird.

240
00:16:10,205 --> 00:16:11,706
I know her.

241
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,584
'Ere, that's mine, ain't it?

242
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:16,586
Can I have that one? Ta.

243
00:16:20,465 --> 00:16:21,591
'Scuse me.

244
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,102
'Ere, Dan. Seen what's
goin' on in there?

245
00:16:32,185 --> 00:16:35,396
Go in there. It's a laugh!
You'll love it!

246
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:39,234
Cheers.

247
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:28,158
Oh, let's have some!

248
00:17:28,741 --> 00:17:30,910
Come on, Monkey,
don't mess about.

249
00:17:31,035 --> 00:17:33,079
Not unless you
give me something.

250
00:17:33,204 --> 00:17:34,289
What?

251
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,835
You always have to ask,
don't you?

252
00:17:51,014 --> 00:17:53,933
1, 2, 3 for you.

253
00:17:54,017 --> 00:17:55,602
Where'd you get these, eh?

254
00:17:55,685 --> 00:17:57,270
That'd be telling, wouldn't it?

255
00:17:57,353 --> 00:18:00,023
You forgot I work
for the chemist.

256
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,756
Come on, then!

257
00:19:09,968 --> 00:19:11,511
Let's go.

258
00:19:12,762 --> 00:19:15,098
# People try to put us down

259
00:19:15,181 --> 00:19:17,892
# Talkin' 'bout my generation

260
00:19:17,976 --> 00:19:20,270
# Just because we get around

261
00:19:20,353 --> 00:19:22,814
# Talkin' 'bout my generation

262
00:19:22,897 --> 00:19:25,066
# The things they do
look awful cold

263
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,694
# Talkin' bout my generation

264
00:19:27,777 --> 00:19:30,238
# Hope I die before I get old

265
00:19:30,321 --> 00:19:32,240
# Talkin' 'bout my generation

266
00:19:32,323 --> 00:19:34,534
# My generation

267
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:37,203
# My generation, baby

268
00:19:38,204 --> 00:19:40,081
- # Why don't you all f...
- Fuck off!

269
00:19:40,165 --> 00:19:42,709
# Talkin' 'bout my generation

270
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:45,336
# Don't try to dig
what we all say

271
00:19:45,462 --> 00:19:47,839
# Talkin' 'bout my generation

272
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:50,425
# I'm not tryin' to cause
a big s...ensation

273
00:19:50,508 --> 00:19:52,552
# Talkin' 'bout my generation

274
00:19:52,635 --> 00:19:57,265
# Just talkin'
'bout my g-g-generation

275
00:19:57,348 --> 00:19:59,768
# My generation

276
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:02,520
# My generation, baby #

277
00:20:07,192 --> 00:20:08,359
And again!

278
00:21:32,777 --> 00:21:33,778
Dave?

279
00:21:33,862 --> 00:21:36,281
Leave it out, Jim.
Give us a break.

280
00:21:36,364 --> 00:21:38,032
Sorry, John, eh?

281
00:21:38,491 --> 00:21:39,701
Get in there.

282
00:21:43,663 --> 00:21:45,206
- Dave!
- What?

283
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,624
What are you doin'?

284
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,334
What d'you think?

285
00:21:48,418 --> 00:21:50,962
Oh, yeah? Where've I seen
that face before?

286
00:21:51,045 --> 00:21:54,215
- You all right?
- Yeah, get in there!

287
00:21:55,175 --> 00:21:56,718
Piss off, will ya?

288
00:21:56,801 --> 00:21:57,927
Sorry, sorry.

289
00:21:58,011 --> 00:21:59,304
Shut the door!

290
00:22:13,902 --> 00:22:14,903
Oi!

291
00:22:23,995 --> 00:22:25,455
Jimmy!

292
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,623
Whoo-hoo!

293
00:22:27,457 --> 00:22:28,708
Jim!

294
00:22:38,968 --> 00:22:40,095
Great!

295
00:22:45,475 --> 00:22:47,936
What is this? What's going on?

296
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:49,521
Look at my plants!

297
00:23:12,377 --> 00:23:14,921
# Every year is the same

298
00:23:15,004 --> 00:23:17,382
# And I feel it again

299
00:23:17,465 --> 00:23:21,010
# I'm a loser - no chance to win

300
00:23:22,804 --> 00:23:24,639
# Leaves start fallin'

301
00:23:24,722 --> 00:23:27,183
# Come down is callin'

302
00:23:27,267 --> 00:23:30,687
# Loneliness starts sinkin' in

303
00:23:31,729 --> 00:23:33,356
# But I'm one

304
00:23:36,317 --> 00:23:38,445
# I am one

305
00:23:41,948 --> 00:23:46,161
# And I can see that this is me

306
00:23:46,244 --> 00:23:48,204
# And I will be

307
00:23:49,706 --> 00:23:52,167
# You'll all see I'm the one #

308
00:23:53,543 --> 00:23:54,544
Eh?

309
00:24:10,018 --> 00:24:11,019
'Ere.

310
00:24:13,146 --> 00:24:14,689
And the paper.

311
00:24:14,773 --> 00:24:15,774
Thank you.

312
00:24:24,157 --> 00:24:25,825
Take that to Mr Phelps.

313
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:27,535
That's for Phelpsy, eh?

314
00:24:33,374 --> 00:24:35,168
- 'Ere.
- You're late.

315
00:24:35,293 --> 00:24:36,669
The letters...

316
00:25:06,407 --> 00:25:08,618
Saw the rounds yesterday,
Michael.

317
00:25:08,701 --> 00:25:10,703
For people like you, Phil, eh?

318
00:25:10,787 --> 00:25:12,956
I'd like you to look at them.

319
00:25:13,081 --> 00:25:14,457
Sure, what's the problem?

320
00:25:14,582 --> 00:25:16,793
Well, the overall
campaign's going well.

321
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:19,838
Seen the posters?

322
00:25:19,963 --> 00:25:21,798
Yes. Gorgeous tart.

323
00:25:27,303 --> 00:25:30,265
The trouble is, the clients
are getting over-greedy.

324
00:25:30,348 --> 00:25:31,349
As usual.

325
00:25:31,433 --> 00:25:34,394
They want to corner
the entire youth market.

326
00:25:34,477 --> 00:25:36,813
Cut right across the groupings.

327
00:25:36,896 --> 00:25:39,065
It's all right
with A's and B's...

328
00:25:41,484 --> 00:25:44,362
..young managers, graduates,
that type of person.

329
00:25:46,406 --> 00:25:49,033
It's C's and D's
I'm worried about.

330
00:25:49,117 --> 00:25:51,744
It's a bit up-market for them.

331
00:25:51,828 --> 00:25:54,914
I'll look at it for you,
Simon. With pleasure.

332
00:25:54,998 --> 00:25:56,875
- 2:30 all right?
- Fine.

333
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,420
You don't think this lung cancer
talk will make a difference?

334
00:26:00,545 --> 00:26:01,546
No, young people...

335
00:26:02,714 --> 00:26:04,090
They're not worried.

336
00:26:04,174 --> 00:26:05,717
Glad I gave it up.

337
00:26:12,015 --> 00:26:12,557
'Pychopathic,
that's what it was.'

338
00:26:12,557 --> 00:26:13,475
'Pychopathic,
that's what it was.'

339
00:26:13,892 --> 00:26:17,103
- 'I thought something's wrong.'
- 'Shut up and listen to me.'

340
00:26:17,604 --> 00:26:21,775
'Your next assignment
is to get Sir Thomas Weller.'

341
00:26:23,651 --> 00:26:26,321
'You bonkers? He's the
guv.'

342
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,450
Ow!

343
00:26:30,533 --> 00:26:32,035
'What, no lolly?'

344
00:26:32,118 --> 00:26:33,244
Where you been?

345
00:26:34,621 --> 00:26:38,291
Fell asleep on the train.
I wound up in bloody Neasden.

346
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:42,086
Ridin' about on them motorbikes
all night, I'm not surprised.

347
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,463
It's not normal.

348
00:26:43,588 --> 00:26:48,009
'A nice quiet piece of
scenery and kick him to a pulp.'

349
00:26:48,093 --> 00:26:50,595
Oh, yeah? What's normal, then?

350
00:26:56,267 --> 00:26:57,519
What's that?

351
00:27:23,962 --> 00:27:25,338
Hello, Jim.

352
00:27:27,382 --> 00:27:29,384
Thought I'd just pop by, like.

353
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:31,177
You don't mind, do you?

354
00:27:31,261 --> 00:27:33,138
No, I don't mind. Come in.

355
00:27:33,221 --> 00:27:34,305
Cheers.

356
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,808
What's the matter, then?

357
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:38,643
She's misfirin' a bit.

358
00:27:39,102 --> 00:27:40,979
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

359
00:27:41,646 --> 00:27:42,856
It's your plug.

360
00:27:42,939 --> 00:27:45,066
Got some tools on the bike,
hold up.

361
00:27:55,368 --> 00:27:57,662
It'll break your
bleedin' leg off, that.

362
00:27:57,745 --> 00:27:59,664
No wonder you wear
those boots.

363
00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:01,666
It's the best bike
ever made.

364
00:28:01,791 --> 00:28:04,544
I've got a ton, five
out of that.

365
00:28:05,587 --> 00:28:07,297
Better than that poxy hairdryer.

366
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,007
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

367
00:28:10,508 --> 00:28:12,510
Well, that isn't it, is it?

368
00:28:12,594 --> 00:28:16,097
I mean, it isn't the bikes,
is it? It's the people.

369
00:28:16,181 --> 00:28:19,517
And people riding these are
states, third class tickets.

370
00:28:19,601 --> 00:28:20,602
Do what?

371
00:28:20,685 --> 00:28:25,023
Rockers, all that greasy hair
and clobber. It's diabolical.

372
00:28:25,523 --> 00:28:29,110
I don't give a monkey's arsehole
about mods and rockers.

373
00:28:29,194 --> 00:28:31,488
Underneath, we're all the same,
ain't we?

374
00:28:31,571 --> 00:28:32,989
Nah, Kev, that's it.

375
00:28:33,072 --> 00:28:35,867
I don't wanna be the same
as everybody else.

376
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,203
That's why I'm a mod, see?

377
00:28:38,286 --> 00:28:40,747
I mean, you gotta
be somebody, ain't you?

378
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,875
Or why not jump
in the sea and drown?

379
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,253
That's why I joined the army,
to be different.

380
00:28:47,378 --> 00:28:49,506
To get away from all this.

381
00:28:50,215 --> 00:28:52,509
Wherever you go,
there's always some cunt

382
00:28:52,634 --> 00:28:54,636
who wants to push you about.

383
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:56,054
Run it, please!

384
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:01,726
Two bob.

385
00:29:04,813 --> 00:29:05,939
I'll see you.

386
00:29:07,273 --> 00:29:08,358
Two fives.

387
00:29:08,441 --> 00:29:09,442
Hey!

388
00:29:09,526 --> 00:29:10,652
Nah, that's bollocks.

389
00:29:10,735 --> 00:29:12,904
Three of a kind don't beat that.

390
00:29:12,987 --> 00:29:14,864
- It does.
- Who says?

391
00:29:14,948 --> 00:29:16,116
I do!

392
00:29:16,491 --> 00:29:18,284
He's right you know, Harry.

393
00:29:27,418 --> 00:29:29,129
Will you run it, please?

394
00:29:43,518 --> 00:29:45,645
I was late.

395
00:29:46,229 --> 00:29:50,817
She was waiting
in the wrong place.

396
00:29:51,192 --> 00:29:52,569
And by the time I found her...

397
00:29:53,486 --> 00:29:56,281
Did you get us some blues, then?

398
00:29:56,364 --> 00:29:59,159
I'll have to see, won't I?
I dunno.

399
00:30:04,747 --> 00:30:05,999
One card.

400
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:09,085
Down and dirty.

401
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:11,671
Make a mod out of you yet,
Harry, eh?

402
00:30:11,796 --> 00:30:15,049
I don't think, though,
they make Levis in your size.

403
00:30:15,175 --> 00:30:16,176
Bollocks.

404
00:30:19,971 --> 00:30:22,515
- Is it me?
- Yeah.

405
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,725
All right.

406
00:30:23,808 --> 00:30:26,269
- Threes.
- Threes.

407
00:30:28,813 --> 00:30:30,273
Two bob.

408
00:30:31,441 --> 00:30:32,525
I'm out.

409
00:30:32,609 --> 00:30:36,362
Yeah, so am I. You're a fuckin'
jammy bleeder, Cooper.

410
00:30:36,446 --> 00:30:39,824
You're gettin' chicken, Des.
Look, I only had an ace.

411
00:30:42,285 --> 00:30:44,662
I gotta go
to Broadwick Street now.

412
00:30:44,746 --> 00:30:46,414
Take some stuff up there.

413
00:30:46,498 --> 00:30:49,083
Will you run
that film again, please?

414
00:30:49,167 --> 00:30:50,752
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

415
00:30:54,506 --> 00:30:58,802
Oh, yeah, Des. I don't like
to be cruel. Take it all back.

416
00:30:58,927 --> 00:31:00,970
Nah, it's yours. You won it.

417
00:31:01,054 --> 00:31:04,099
That's the ten bob I owe you.

418
00:31:04,182 --> 00:31:07,685
Fuck off! I ain't carrying
all that fuckin' change about!

419
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:11,689
Take it or leave it, me son.
Take it or leave it.

420
00:31:12,148 --> 00:31:15,026
I'll see you later, Harry.
See you, Des.

421
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:34,087
Er, Mr Cale sent me to collect
some stuff for Broadwick Street.

422
00:31:34,212 --> 00:31:38,591
Yes, we've been waiting
for you for over an hour.

423
00:31:38,716 --> 00:31:39,884
Yeah?

424
00:31:43,263 --> 00:31:48,309
Come on, that stuff's got
to be over there fast. F.A.S.T.

425
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:51,938
Watch the cloth, moth.

426
00:31:52,856 --> 00:31:54,399
Tacky little herbert.

427
00:31:57,152 --> 00:31:59,821
- You want to hear it?
- Yeah.

428
00:31:59,904 --> 00:32:01,197
Number two.

429
00:32:40,445 --> 00:32:43,448
Oh, boy!
What you gonna do tonight?

430
00:32:43,531 --> 00:32:45,533
Wait for a call, I suppose.

431
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:49,370
Listen, I'll see you
later, all right? Bye!

432
00:32:51,247 --> 00:32:52,540
Wotcher, Jimmy.

433
00:32:52,624 --> 00:32:54,250
What you doing here, then?

434
00:32:54,334 --> 00:32:56,711
- Waiting for you.
- Yeah? What for?

435
00:32:56,795 --> 00:32:59,172
- To give you a lift.
- Great.

436
00:32:59,297 --> 00:33:00,590
- Steph?
- What?

437
00:33:00,715 --> 00:33:02,592
You goin' to Brighton
this weekend?

438
00:33:02,717 --> 00:33:05,261
- Yeah, you?
- 'Course I am.

439
00:33:05,386 --> 00:33:06,554
Who you goin' with?

440
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:09,307
Pete's taking me.
Gonna be good, innit?

441
00:33:09,641 --> 00:33:12,060
Yeah. Good.

442
00:33:12,143 --> 00:33:14,938
You and Pete gettin'
a bit strong, then?

443
00:33:15,021 --> 00:33:18,358
No, 'course not.
He's a laugh, that's all.

444
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:20,693
Bit flash though, ain't he?

445
00:33:20,777 --> 00:33:23,279
I wouldn't be with him
otherwise, would I?

446
00:33:23,363 --> 00:33:26,116
Nah. S'pose not.

447
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:27,200
You jealous?

448
00:33:27,283 --> 00:33:28,409
'Course I ain't.

449
00:33:28,493 --> 00:33:31,955
Nah? That's a pity,
I thought you was.

450
00:33:44,384 --> 00:33:46,010
It's a technique!

451
00:33:46,094 --> 00:33:47,178
All right, boys?

452
00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:50,306
So what we gonna do about pills?

453
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:53,476
If we're goin' to Brighton,
we'll need bloody millions.

454
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,520
I wanna get out me head.

455
00:33:55,603 --> 00:33:58,106
That's not difficult
with your little monkey brain.

456
00:33:58,189 --> 00:33:59,190
Bollocks!

457
00:33:59,274 --> 00:34:02,569
Get some rockers off their
heads, knock 'em off!

458
00:34:02,652 --> 00:34:04,821
I was thinkin' about
getting a gun.

459
00:34:04,904 --> 00:34:06,739
Don't talk bloody daft!

460
00:34:06,823 --> 00:34:08,491
I'm gettin' my suit tomorrow.

461
00:34:08,575 --> 00:34:10,660
Only 'cause
you wanna screw Steph.

462
00:34:10,743 --> 00:34:12,454
- No!
- Hey, Jim!

463
00:34:14,581 --> 00:34:16,583
Hey! Hey! Hey!

464
00:34:21,337 --> 00:34:22,297
Go outside!

465
00:34:22,422 --> 00:34:23,590
We're goin', ain't we.

466
00:34:23,715 --> 00:34:25,341
Oh, let's go, then.

467
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:33,725
The rolls have got scabs on 'em!

468
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,840
Shit.

469
00:35:12,263 --> 00:35:14,808
- Get off it a sec.
- Spider!

470
00:35:17,852 --> 00:35:19,145
What's up, then?

471
00:35:19,229 --> 00:35:21,147
- Dunno.
- Breakdown?

472
00:35:21,231 --> 00:35:22,774
Must be the points.

473
00:35:22,857 --> 00:35:25,318
- See you there.
- Yeah. Ten minutes.

474
00:35:25,401 --> 00:35:27,237
You'd do better to catch a bus!

475
00:35:28,196 --> 00:35:30,240
We will, then!

476
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,586
Shit.

477
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,921
What's up with it?

478
00:35:45,004 --> 00:35:47,173
How am I supposed
to bleedin' know?

479
00:35:47,298 --> 00:35:50,385
# Met him on a Monday
and my heart stood still

480
00:35:50,468 --> 00:35:53,555
# Da do ron ron ron,
da do ron ron

481
00:35:53,638 --> 00:35:56,558
# Somebody told me
that his name was Bill

482
00:35:56,641 --> 00:35:59,352
# Da do ron ron ron,
da do ron ron #

483
00:36:05,817 --> 00:36:07,610
Oh, shit!

484
00:36:10,071 --> 00:36:12,907
What's up? Your mother's
hairdryer blown up, has it?

485
00:36:12,991 --> 00:36:14,200
Rubber band busted?

486
00:36:14,284 --> 00:36:17,579
- Yeah.
- No, let's fix it.

487
00:36:17,662 --> 00:36:20,373
Hold on,
we don't do nothin' for nothin'.

488
00:36:20,457 --> 00:36:24,252
Why don't you piss off?
Bloody leave us alone.

489
00:36:24,335 --> 00:36:26,921
Hold on, Lenny,
they don't want our help.

490
00:36:27,005 --> 00:36:31,342
Are you the boy or the girl?
It's hard to tell with you lot.

491
00:36:31,468 --> 00:36:33,762
This one. Give us a kiss.

492
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:34,888
Piss off!

493
00:36:34,971 --> 00:36:37,348
You bastards!

494
00:36:39,768 --> 00:36:41,186
This one's the bird!

495
00:36:42,604 --> 00:36:44,022
Bugger off!

496
00:36:45,356 --> 00:36:47,400
- Spider!
- Let's go!

497
00:36:47,484 --> 00:36:49,861
Spider!

498
00:36:49,944 --> 00:36:51,988
So long, suckers!

499
00:36:52,071 --> 00:36:55,158
Fuck off!

500
00:36:55,241 --> 00:36:56,659
Bloody hell.

501
00:37:02,248 --> 00:37:03,583
# Yeah, my heart stood still

502
00:37:05,251 --> 00:37:08,379
# Yes, his name was Bill

503
00:37:08,463 --> 00:37:10,673
# Yeah,
and when he walked me home... #

504
00:37:10,757 --> 00:37:13,843
Lads, I've just seen Spider
outside. He's taken a kicking!

505
00:37:13,968 --> 00:37:15,428
Some rockers have had him!

506
00:37:15,553 --> 00:37:18,431
- You're joking?
- He's outside on the stairs.

507
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,808
Come on!

508
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:23,561
Spider? You all right, yeah?

509
00:37:23,645 --> 00:37:26,022
What's this about rockers
kickin' you in?

510
00:37:26,106 --> 00:37:28,233
I'm gonna murder
the bleedin' scum!

511
00:37:28,316 --> 00:37:29,692
You lot! Come on!

512
00:37:29,776 --> 00:37:31,569
Stay there, right?

513
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,864
- What we gonna do?
- Fucking kill 'em!

514
00:37:34,948 --> 00:37:37,200
- Right! Come on!
- Are you with me?

515
00:37:37,283 --> 00:37:41,704
Murder!

516
00:37:52,715 --> 00:37:54,551
# Yes, he looked so fine

517
00:37:56,052 --> 00:37:59,139
# Yes, I made him mine

518
00:37:59,264 --> 00:38:01,933
# And when he walked me home

519
00:38:02,016 --> 00:38:05,937
# Da do ron ron ron,
da do ron ron

520
00:38:39,512 --> 00:38:40,972
There they fuckin' are!

521
00:39:13,046 --> 00:39:14,506
Fuckin' hell!

522
00:39:15,632 --> 00:39:17,550
Fuckin' have 'im!

523
00:39:21,304 --> 00:39:22,305
Jim!

524
00:39:22,388 --> 00:39:24,182
You wanted it, didn't you?

525
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:27,519
Fuck off! Leave 'im alone!

526
00:39:28,353 --> 00:39:30,271
Leave 'im alone!

527
00:39:45,245 --> 00:39:47,914
- Leg it!
- Fuckin' law'll be here!

528
00:40:25,869 --> 00:40:28,079
What sort of time
d'you call this?

529
00:40:28,163 --> 00:40:29,914
I haven't got a watch.

530
00:40:29,998 --> 00:40:33,042
Don't come funny, lad.
It's nearly midnight, isn't it?

531
00:40:33,126 --> 00:40:35,879
I ain't gonna turn
into a pumpkin, am I?

532
00:40:35,962 --> 00:40:37,172
Anyway, you're pissed.

533
00:40:38,006 --> 00:40:39,007
Fuckin'...

534
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,508
What's going on?

535
00:40:43,678 --> 00:40:46,097
I've been sat up,
waiting for you.

536
00:40:46,222 --> 00:40:48,349
I can do without
your clever remarks.

537
00:40:48,475 --> 00:40:49,476
George!

538
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:51,019
Who d'you think you are?

539
00:40:51,144 --> 00:40:53,521
I don't know. You tell me, eh?

540
00:40:53,605 --> 00:40:56,316
You're barmy, that's what.
Staying out all hours.

541
00:40:56,399 --> 00:41:00,487
Gettin' up to God knows what.
Dressing like a bloody freak.

542
00:41:01,279 --> 00:41:03,448
Stand still when
I'm talking to you.

543
00:41:03,531 --> 00:41:05,742
I wouldn't be surprised
if you're on drugs.

544
00:41:05,825 --> 00:41:06,826
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

545
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:09,829
I know what you
get up to, your gang.

546
00:41:09,913 --> 00:41:14,375
You've got to be part of a gang.
Got to be a mod.

547
00:41:14,459 --> 00:41:16,878
Haven't you got
a mind of your own?

548
00:41:16,961 --> 00:41:20,256
I'll tell you,
you're schizophrenic, you are.

549
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,674
What's that, then, eh?

550
00:41:21,758 --> 00:41:24,302
I'll tell you.
It's somebody like you,

551
00:41:24,385 --> 00:41:26,888
who doesn't know
where his mind is.

552
00:41:27,013 --> 00:41:28,807
Bloody split personality.

553
00:41:31,351 --> 00:41:33,645
Half your mother's family
were the same.

554
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,647
That's where you get it.

555
00:41:36,397 --> 00:41:39,317
Your Uncle Sid was always
trying to kill himself.

556
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,945
And when he did
it was an accident.

557
00:41:42,237 --> 00:41:44,405
He never knew what he was doing.

558
00:41:44,489 --> 00:41:47,951
- What happened to him?
- He got drowned, didn't he?

559
00:41:48,034 --> 00:41:50,578
Fell down a bleedin' well
in the garden.

560
00:41:53,206 --> 00:41:55,458
Go on, get off to bed.

561
00:43:08,281 --> 00:43:10,575
Jimmy? Jimmy!

562
00:43:12,327 --> 00:43:15,121
Come on, you,
you're late as it is.

563
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:20,752
- Jimmy!
- Don't...

564
00:43:20,835 --> 00:43:22,337
Come on, wake up.

565
00:43:29,928 --> 00:43:31,221
I'm not well, Mum.

566
00:43:31,304 --> 00:43:34,265
- What?
- I can't go in. I'm not well.

567
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:35,767
Oh!

568
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:39,437
Something wrong with your head?
Lying there in your clothes!

569
00:43:39,562 --> 00:43:41,106
It's not normal.

570
00:43:41,189 --> 00:43:44,025
Well, I can't stand here.
I've gotta get on.

571
00:43:44,776 --> 00:43:48,738
Make sure you go to the
doctor for a certificate, hear?

572
00:43:48,822 --> 00:43:49,823
Yes.

573
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,551
Hang on, what about them blokes
Pete was on about?

574
00:44:09,634 --> 00:44:11,845
What? Always got bags of it?

575
00:44:11,928 --> 00:44:15,348
Straight out the back door
of the chemical factory?

576
00:44:15,432 --> 00:44:17,308
That's fuckin' rubbish.

577
00:44:17,434 --> 00:44:20,770
Just the sort of bollocks you'd
expect from that flash cunt.

578
00:44:20,854 --> 00:44:22,897
Yeah, but it's worth a try.

579
00:44:23,022 --> 00:44:25,316
- I'll try him now.
- Nothing to do?

580
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,735
All right, George,
half a minute.

581
00:44:27,819 --> 00:44:29,446
I'll pick you up later.

582
00:44:29,529 --> 00:44:30,864
Yeah, all right, Jim.

583
00:44:35,201 --> 00:44:36,828
D'you want a push start?

584
00:44:36,911 --> 00:44:38,496
No, thanks.

585
00:44:45,378 --> 00:44:46,379
Hey, Jim!

586
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:48,465
I'll be on me own bike tomorrow.

587
00:44:48,548 --> 00:44:49,549
Eh?

588
00:44:49,632 --> 00:44:51,551
The scooter's back
from the garage.

589
00:44:51,634 --> 00:44:53,720
Burn the arse off
your rust bucket.

590
00:44:53,803 --> 00:44:55,221
Any time.

591
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:17,660
Butch! Jenny! It's all right.

592
00:45:17,744 --> 00:45:19,954
Go on, get back in there.

593
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:23,917
Hello, young Jim. On holiday?

594
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,461
Nah, just fancied the day off.

595
00:45:27,045 --> 00:45:29,798
You'll be a bloody beatnik
before you know it.

596
00:45:29,881 --> 00:45:32,634
Ban the bomb and do fuck all.
Poncin' about.

597
00:45:32,717 --> 00:45:36,221
Oh, you're all right.
Just you and your Uncle Charlie.

598
00:45:36,304 --> 00:45:39,099
Don't have to bother
with a load of cunts.

599
00:45:39,182 --> 00:45:41,976
- You know what I mean.
- I don't.

600
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,311
No work, no money.

601
00:45:43,436 --> 00:45:45,313
And I like money.

602
00:45:45,438 --> 00:45:48,691
'Ere, Pete, what about Brighton
this weekend, eh?

603
00:45:48,775 --> 00:45:49,776
What about it?

604
00:45:50,693 --> 00:45:51,903
Er, pills.

605
00:45:51,986 --> 00:45:54,572
We thought you might
get hold of some.

606
00:45:54,656 --> 00:45:57,075
Why me?
I'm not a fuckin' pusher.

607
00:45:57,158 --> 00:45:59,744
No, but you know
some blokes who are?

608
00:45:59,828 --> 00:46:00,829
Not me.

609
00:46:00,912 --> 00:46:02,330
Charlie's mates.

610
00:46:02,747 --> 00:46:06,918
And I'm not gonna start blabbing
about mates of Charlie's.

611
00:46:07,001 --> 00:46:09,462
They're fuckin' big.
They don't mess about.

612
00:46:11,047 --> 00:46:14,759
Anyway, don't know why you're
worryin'. Ferdy'll have some.

613
00:46:14,843 --> 00:46:17,053
Well, Ferdy ain't
been seen, has he?

614
00:46:17,137 --> 00:46:21,266
He'll turn up. Friday, he'll pop
up like a jack-in-the-box.

615
00:46:21,975 --> 00:46:23,518
Or a golliwog.

616
00:46:28,606 --> 00:46:30,442
Ain't bloody here, is he?

617
00:46:30,525 --> 00:46:32,861
Cunt. I wonder where he is?

618
00:46:32,944 --> 00:46:34,362
I dunno.

619
00:46:34,446 --> 00:46:37,073
This place gives me the shits.

620
00:46:37,157 --> 00:46:38,575
Bleedin' nig-nogs everywhere.

621
00:46:38,658 --> 00:46:39,659
Shut up.

622
00:46:39,742 --> 00:46:41,703
It's like bleedin'
Calcutta round 'ere.

623
00:46:41,786 --> 00:46:43,746
Calcutta's in India.

624
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:47,375
Yeah, West India. That's where
they bleedin' come from, innit?

625
00:46:47,959 --> 00:46:50,795
- Yeah.
- What's so funny?

626
00:46:57,761 --> 00:46:59,763
Just who you lookin' for,
Mister?

627
00:46:59,846 --> 00:47:01,014
Is Ferdy in?

628
00:47:01,097 --> 00:47:03,016
He not here. Him gone out.

629
00:47:06,686 --> 00:47:07,812
Looking for Ferdy?

630
00:47:07,937 --> 00:47:10,231
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

631
00:47:10,315 --> 00:47:11,483
He's gone out.

632
00:47:11,566 --> 00:47:13,610
Oh. Yeah.

633
00:47:15,361 --> 00:47:18,907
Stitchin' me up an' all,
the bloke. Fuckin'...

634
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:20,533
Peter Fenton!

635
00:47:21,743 --> 00:47:23,244
Oh. Peter!

636
00:47:25,705 --> 00:47:26,706
Thanks.

637
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,251
Peter Fenton. Who is it?

638
00:47:31,753 --> 00:47:33,671
Fuckin' hell, why ring me here?

639
00:47:33,755 --> 00:47:38,343
Listen, you cunt. Tell us
where to find these blokes,

640
00:47:38,426 --> 00:47:41,387
- or we're stuck for Brighton.
- OK. This time.

641
00:48:09,124 --> 00:48:10,333
Hold this, then.

642
00:48:10,417 --> 00:48:11,418
What for?

643
00:48:11,501 --> 00:48:14,796
Well, I ain't goin' in there
with me parka on.

644
00:48:19,717 --> 00:48:20,718
Jim!

645
00:48:37,986 --> 00:48:39,237
What d'you want, son?

646
00:48:39,362 --> 00:48:41,531
Is, er, Harry North about?

647
00:48:41,614 --> 00:48:42,615
Who are you, then?

648
00:48:42,699 --> 00:48:44,534
I got a message for him.

649
00:48:45,034 --> 00:48:47,078
Hang about a minute, all right?

650
00:48:59,466 --> 00:49:00,675
Come through here.

651
00:49:01,092 --> 00:49:03,011
Come through, come through.

652
00:49:05,889 --> 00:49:07,182
Go on, through here.

653
00:49:19,652 --> 00:49:21,946
That's him in the grey suit.

654
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:23,865
Go on, you're all right.

655
00:49:28,453 --> 00:49:30,705
What can I do for you, son?

656
00:49:30,789 --> 00:49:32,665
- Me uncle Charlie.
- Who?

657
00:49:32,749 --> 00:49:34,876
Charlie Fenton, he said...

658
00:49:35,835 --> 00:49:37,670
You Charlie's boy?

659
00:49:37,962 --> 00:49:39,297
His nephew, yeah.

660
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,424
His nephew.
What's your name, son?

661
00:49:41,508 --> 00:49:42,634
Jimmy.

662
00:49:43,468 --> 00:49:46,763
It's a pleasure to meet
any one of the Fentons.

663
00:49:47,305 --> 00:49:48,598
D'you wanna drink, son?

664
00:49:48,681 --> 00:49:51,059
No, thanks.
I gotta get goin' soon.

665
00:49:51,142 --> 00:49:52,977
What can I do for you, then?

666
00:49:55,063 --> 00:49:57,232
You can talk here.
We're all pals.

667
00:49:57,357 --> 00:49:59,234
Well, I wanted some pills.

668
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,569
Oh. What d'you want?

669
00:50:01,653 --> 00:50:04,114
Purple Hearts, blues, Dexedrine?

670
00:50:04,197 --> 00:50:06,241
- Some blues.
- Some blues?

671
00:50:06,324 --> 00:50:07,408
I got a tenner.

672
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,035
Not in here, son.

673
00:50:10,036 --> 00:50:12,080
Teddy! Come here.

674
00:50:14,374 --> 00:50:18,670
This is Teddy. Go for a walk
with him, he'll do the business.

675
00:50:18,753 --> 00:50:22,465
Here, give my regards
to your Uncle Charlie, son.

676
00:50:23,633 --> 00:50:24,634
Pill-head.

677
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,719
Come on, Ronnie!

678
00:50:28,012 --> 00:50:29,722
Come on, Ron!

679
00:50:30,765 --> 00:50:32,100
Tosser.

680
00:50:35,687 --> 00:50:36,813
Wotcher.

681
00:50:51,244 --> 00:50:52,579
It's all there.

682
00:51:03,757 --> 00:51:07,135
250, it'll see us through
till Christmas, eh?

683
00:51:08,303 --> 00:51:11,139
One for the road, eh?

684
00:51:11,222 --> 00:51:12,807
Come on, hurry up.

685
00:51:12,891 --> 00:51:15,226
That ain't a blue!

686
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:17,187
It's paraffin!

687
00:51:18,521 --> 00:51:21,357
We've been done!
That's my three quid wasted!

688
00:51:21,441 --> 00:51:22,525
Yeah. And mine!

689
00:51:24,027 --> 00:51:25,862
Let's do the bastards' motor.

690
00:51:25,945 --> 00:51:26,946
Right.

691
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:28,031
Come on!

692
00:51:32,035 --> 00:51:33,369
Get out the way!

693
00:51:35,038 --> 00:51:36,915
- Come on!
- Go!

694
00:51:39,501 --> 00:51:40,543
You on?

695
00:51:43,213 --> 00:51:45,048
Wankers!

696
00:51:57,393 --> 00:51:58,436
Shh.

697
00:52:05,485 --> 00:52:06,486
Go on.

698
00:52:06,569 --> 00:52:07,570
Shove it, man.

699
00:52:09,114 --> 00:52:11,574
Nice one.
You're fuckin' makin' a racket.

700
00:52:11,699 --> 00:52:14,577
- Do we have to do this?
- 'Course we do.

701
00:52:14,661 --> 00:52:17,580
We don't wanna leave
prints all over, do we?

702
00:52:17,664 --> 00:52:19,374
My arse. It's the smell.

703
00:52:19,457 --> 00:52:20,458
Shh.

704
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:34,931
We must be able
to find some pills here, eh?

705
00:52:35,014 --> 00:52:36,015
Shh!

706
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:38,685
Oh, yes!

707
00:52:53,116 --> 00:52:54,534
Shut up!

708
00:52:54,617 --> 00:52:57,662
- Fucking shut up!
- All right.

709
00:53:00,957 --> 00:53:02,375
Shh. Shh.

710
00:53:04,627 --> 00:53:06,379
Jim, I just thought.

711
00:53:06,463 --> 00:53:07,464
What?

712
00:53:07,547 --> 00:53:09,048
- Footprints.
- Footprints?

713
00:53:09,132 --> 00:53:12,469
You got lines on your feet,
same as your fingers.

714
00:53:12,552 --> 00:53:16,514
Must be thousands
of pills here... Millions.

715
00:53:16,598 --> 00:53:20,393
Ah, nothing's there,
I'm gonna search in here...

716
00:53:20,477 --> 00:53:22,145
I'm puttin' me socks on.

717
00:53:22,228 --> 00:53:23,605
I ain't stupid.

718
00:53:28,693 --> 00:53:29,861
Police!

719
00:53:38,453 --> 00:53:41,664
Lads, look at these! Johnnies!
Fuckin' hundreds of 'em!

720
00:53:41,748 --> 00:53:43,333
Chuck us some packets!

721
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:45,126
You got something
planned tonight?

722
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:46,419
'Course I have.

723
00:54:08,024 --> 00:54:09,609
Oh! Yellows.

724
00:54:10,443 --> 00:54:13,446
Chalky, what you doin'?
Give us a hand, eh?

725
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:15,490
Not takin' no chances, am I?

726
00:54:17,075 --> 00:54:19,035
Come on! Shut up!

727
00:54:19,994 --> 00:54:21,579
Get down to it, eh?

728
00:54:27,293 --> 00:54:29,754
A-ha! Found 'em! They're blues!

729
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:31,756
I found some blues.

730
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:32,924
There's not many.

731
00:54:33,007 --> 00:54:34,634
Perhaps someone's
been nickin' 'em.

732
00:54:34,717 --> 00:54:36,553
Fuckin' hell!

733
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:41,975
Hang on.

734
00:54:42,058 --> 00:54:43,268
Chalky, come on!

735
00:54:43,351 --> 00:54:45,645
I'm just gettin'
somethin' for me mum.

736
00:54:47,397 --> 00:54:49,023
I'm droppin' all the blues!

737
00:54:49,107 --> 00:54:50,483
Just get out!

738
00:55:01,911 --> 00:55:04,205
- Right...
- One and tuppence?

739
00:55:04,289 --> 00:55:07,208
OK, you behave
yourself tonight, OK?

740
00:55:07,292 --> 00:55:10,044
I'll try. I'll try
and behave myself tonight.

741
00:55:10,712 --> 00:55:13,423
Yeah, I'm flyin'!
Terrific, ain't they?

742
00:55:13,506 --> 00:55:15,258
Did we have it off or what?

743
00:55:16,468 --> 00:55:18,595
- Hi.
- We done your chemist's.

744
00:55:18,678 --> 00:55:20,096
- You didn't?
- Yeah.

745
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,306
I was gonna phone.

746
00:55:21,389 --> 00:55:24,100
Why didn't you?
I know where everything is.

747
00:55:24,184 --> 00:55:26,227
Here y'are. Got you a Pepsi.

748
00:55:26,311 --> 00:55:28,605
- And a present.
- What is it?

749
00:55:28,688 --> 00:55:30,190
You nicked 'em, didn't you?

750
00:55:30,273 --> 00:55:33,359
You're handling stolen goods.
I'll give you some more.

751
00:55:38,364 --> 00:55:40,825
Listen, d'you fancy
takin' me home later?

752
00:55:53,046 --> 00:55:54,547
What about Pete, then?

753
00:55:55,006 --> 00:55:56,591
I'll worry about Pete.

754
00:55:57,342 --> 00:56:02,055
But if you tell him, I'll never
ever speak to you again, right?

755
00:56:05,683 --> 00:56:07,727
Don't worry. I won't tell him.

756
00:56:09,687 --> 00:56:12,524
And I'm still going down
to Brighton with him.

757
00:56:12,607 --> 00:56:13,608
Yeah.

758
00:56:13,691 --> 00:56:15,735
I've said I would, haven't I?

759
00:56:16,528 --> 00:56:18,071
Yeah, I s'pose so.

760
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:27,122
# Girl, you really got me now

761
00:56:27,122 --> 00:56:29,040
# Girl, you really got me now

762
00:56:29,124 --> 00:56:32,001
# You got me so
I can't sleep at night

763
00:56:32,085 --> 00:56:34,170
# You really got me. Whoo!

764
00:56:34,712 --> 00:56:36,423
# Really got me. Whoo!

765
00:56:36,756 --> 00:56:38,383
# Really got me. Whoo!

766
00:56:39,467 --> 00:56:40,802
# Please...

767
00:56:44,848 --> 00:56:46,182
Ah, cheers.

768
00:56:46,641 --> 00:56:47,976
How much you get?

769
00:56:49,144 --> 00:56:53,523
Mr Fulford mentioned your
unexplained absence yesterday.

770
00:56:53,606 --> 00:56:54,649
Like what?

771
00:56:54,732 --> 00:56:56,317
Like, don't do it again.

772
00:56:56,401 --> 00:57:00,029
Unless you want to hear him
read the riot act?

773
00:57:00,155 --> 00:57:01,698
I take it you don't.

774
00:57:01,781 --> 00:57:03,741
I'd rather be dead, Mr Cale.

775
00:57:05,452 --> 00:57:08,580
All right. Off you go.

776
00:57:08,663 --> 00:57:09,873
You too, Alec.

777
00:57:13,251 --> 00:57:14,919
Have a nice weekend!

778
00:57:23,511 --> 00:57:26,598
The only way you'll keep
that up is with lacquer.

779
00:57:26,681 --> 00:57:29,601
- No, no lacquer.
- Just a little?

780
00:57:29,684 --> 00:57:31,102
No, poofs wear lacquer.

781
00:57:31,186 --> 00:57:32,353
I wear lacquer.

782
00:57:32,437 --> 00:57:34,939
That's what I mean, innit?

783
00:57:35,023 --> 00:57:37,066
- There y'are.
- Cheers.

784
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:38,359
That's all right.

785
00:57:38,443 --> 00:57:40,111
My bird'll pull that back.

786
00:57:40,236 --> 00:57:41,946
Long as that's all she pulls.

787
00:57:43,031 --> 00:57:43,990
All right.

788
00:57:44,115 --> 00:57:45,116
The usual miracle?

789
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,910
Careful, I've got a rash.

790
00:57:47,035 --> 00:57:50,288
You know how the hair falls?
Goes down the back.

791
00:57:50,371 --> 00:57:52,874
- All right.
- Know what I mean?

792
00:57:52,957 --> 00:57:54,709
- See you, Dan.
- Yeah.

793
00:57:54,793 --> 00:57:55,794
Brighton tomorrow!

794
00:57:55,877 --> 00:57:57,087
Yeah, see you there.

795
00:57:59,297 --> 00:58:01,091
Mum? Mum?

796
00:58:01,925 --> 00:58:03,885
Where've you put
them old newspapers?

797
00:58:03,968 --> 00:58:06,554
You're not gonna make
my carpets wet again?

798
00:58:06,638 --> 00:58:08,807
Nah, I've wrung 'em out
this time.

799
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:10,225
They're under the sink.

800
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:15,772
Gordon Bennett!
What have you got on?

801
00:58:15,855 --> 00:58:19,776
Is this some kind of new fashion
thing I haven't heard about?

802
00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:21,361
Sopping wet trousers?

803
00:58:21,444 --> 00:58:22,695
They're Levis.

804
00:58:22,821 --> 00:58:25,490
Never mind what they are,
they're bleedin' wet!

805
00:58:25,615 --> 00:58:29,035
You gotta shrink 'em on you,
so they fit right.

806
00:58:32,705 --> 00:58:34,666
He's definitely gettin' worse.

807
00:58:42,006 --> 00:58:43,591
# I can go anyway

808
00:58:43,675 --> 00:58:45,260
# (Way I choose )

809
00:58:45,343 --> 00:58:47,262
# I can live anyhow

810
00:58:47,345 --> 00:58:48,513
# (Win or lose )

811
00:58:48,596 --> 00:58:50,390
# I can go anywhere... #

812
00:58:51,141 --> 00:58:52,475
What's this rubbish, then?

813
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:54,102
Ready, Steady, Go!

814
00:58:54,686 --> 00:58:55,687
Ready what?

815
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:57,313
Ready, Steady, Go!

816
00:58:57,397 --> 00:58:59,607
Ready, steady, go?

817
00:59:00,692 --> 00:59:02,026
Bunch of louts.

818
00:59:06,739 --> 00:59:08,116
Bloody moron.

819
00:59:09,409 --> 00:59:11,953
I suppose they wear
wet jeans and all?

820
00:59:12,036 --> 00:59:13,121
Eh?

821
00:59:13,204 --> 00:59:17,542
I..Is that how you're supposed
to play a guitar now, then?

822
00:59:17,625 --> 00:59:18,710
Eh?

823
00:59:19,586 --> 00:59:21,337
Oh, gawd help us.

824
00:59:22,088 --> 00:59:23,506
Here, have you seen this?

825
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:25,800
I haven't got time
for that rubbish.

826
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:31,014
I can sing better
than that little ape.

827
00:59:31,097 --> 00:59:32,390
You call that singing?

828
00:59:33,683 --> 00:59:35,602
Sounds like a drowned dog!

829
00:59:47,363 --> 00:59:49,240
That'll make you deaf, you know.

830
01:00:01,086 --> 01:00:04,923
Gerry & the Pacemakers.
The Animals are next.

831
01:00:05,006 --> 01:00:07,467
This is Big L, 266.

832
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:12,347
Wonderful Radio London. Whoopee!

833
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:16,101
Good morning, it's 6.01. Here
are the main points in the news.

834
01:00:16,184 --> 01:00:18,937
After yesterday's conference
session the Colonial Secretary

835
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:23,274
commented that he hoped for
independence in Aden in a year.

836
01:00:23,358 --> 01:00:26,194
The Bank Holiday started
in earnest last night,

837
01:00:26,277 --> 01:00:28,988
with motorists taking advantage
of the fine weather,

838
01:00:29,114 --> 01:00:30,824
heading towards
the South Coast resorts.

839
01:00:30,907 --> 01:00:34,244
Traffic was reported heavy on
the A127, the Southend road,

840
01:00:34,327 --> 01:00:38,331
and there were jams southbound
on the M1, causing long delays.

841
01:00:38,415 --> 01:00:41,084
Shopkeepers in the Brighton
area, fearing a reoccurrence

842
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:44,504
of disturbances by groups of
rival youths in other resorts,

843
01:00:44,587 --> 01:00:46,548
were putting up
shutters last night.

844
01:00:46,631 --> 01:00:49,676
A spokesman said, while they
weren't expecting any trouble,

845
01:00:49,759 --> 01:00:51,928
they were going
to be prepared...

846
01:01:17,036 --> 01:01:18,663
Show off!

847
01:01:34,637 --> 01:01:35,638
Fuck off!

848
01:01:37,265 --> 01:01:39,309
He thinks he's Davey Crockett!

849
01:01:40,477 --> 01:01:42,479
Give us a mirror!

850
01:01:42,562 --> 01:01:43,563
Piss off!

851
01:01:52,739 --> 01:01:54,240
Chalky!

852
01:01:54,532 --> 01:01:55,658
Hold the bike.

853
01:01:56,117 --> 01:01:57,577
Hey, Chalky! Chalky!

854
01:01:58,411 --> 01:01:59,746
Chalky, you all right?

855
01:02:00,205 --> 01:02:01,289
Chalky!

856
01:02:01,414 --> 01:02:02,665
Yeah, I'm all right.

857
01:02:02,791 --> 01:02:03,792
Anything broken?

858
01:02:03,917 --> 01:02:04,918
Nah.

859
01:02:05,001 --> 01:02:06,252
Shame, eh? Shame.

860
01:02:06,669 --> 01:02:09,672
Nah, it looked good
from back there.

861
01:02:09,756 --> 01:02:12,884
Don't take the piss,
I nearly broke me fuckin' neck.

862
01:02:12,967 --> 01:02:13,968
You're all right.

863
01:02:14,052 --> 01:02:15,220
We'll get 'em, right?

864
01:02:15,303 --> 01:02:17,806
- Fuckin' grease monkeys.
- Follow us up.

865
01:02:17,889 --> 01:02:19,474
Told you I'd burn you.

866
01:02:19,557 --> 01:02:21,768
- See you, Chalk!
- Hang on!

867
01:02:21,851 --> 01:02:24,521
- See you down there!
- See ya!

868
01:02:50,755 --> 01:02:52,382
# Get out and don't come back

869
01:02:53,049 --> 01:02:54,926
# Get out and don't come back

870
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:57,053
# Get out and don't come back

871
01:02:57,387 --> 01:02:59,264
# Get out and don't come back

872
01:03:00,598 --> 01:03:01,641
# Don't come back

873
01:03:02,809 --> 01:03:03,810
# Don't come back

874
01:03:04,894 --> 01:03:05,979
# Don't come back #

875
01:03:22,746 --> 01:03:25,749
Look at that!
That is Brighton, my sons.

876
01:04:12,003 --> 01:04:13,671
Terrific! All right, lads!

877
01:04:13,755 --> 01:04:14,756
Nice one!

878
01:04:14,839 --> 01:04:16,299
John!

879
01:04:18,009 --> 01:04:19,260
Ace!

880
01:04:20,136 --> 01:04:21,262
Here they are!

881
01:04:25,391 --> 01:04:26,392
Whoo!

882
01:04:28,311 --> 01:04:30,939
Hi! What about this?
Everyone's here.

883
01:04:31,022 --> 01:04:32,273
This is great!

884
01:04:32,357 --> 01:04:33,566
Great? Brilliant!

885
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:35,944
Hey, look! There's Bonzo!

886
01:04:36,027 --> 01:04:37,529
Bonzo? Bonzo!

887
01:04:37,821 --> 01:04:39,030
Bonzo!

888
01:04:39,823 --> 01:04:41,741
When'd you get down here, then?

889
01:04:41,825 --> 01:04:43,493
About half an hour ago.

890
01:04:43,576 --> 01:04:45,703
We left before it was light.

891
01:04:45,829 --> 01:04:48,748
- What's it like?
- Dark, weren't it?

892
01:04:48,832 --> 01:04:49,833
Look at him!

893
01:04:52,168 --> 01:04:54,003
Don't he look smart.

894
01:04:54,087 --> 01:04:55,213
Wallop!

895
01:04:55,296 --> 01:04:56,881
Look at the scooter!

896
01:04:58,383 --> 01:04:59,509
That is ace!

897
01:04:59,592 --> 01:05:02,220
Whoo! Whoo!

898
01:05:03,888 --> 01:05:07,225
So, erm... What happened
to you last night?

899
01:05:07,308 --> 01:05:09,644
That'd be tellin', now,
wouldn't it?

900
01:05:13,481 --> 01:05:14,774
Chalky!

901
01:05:19,612 --> 01:05:22,031
Thanks for waitin'!
Bleedin' turd.

902
01:05:27,871 --> 01:05:29,247
Where'd the bird go?

903
01:06:13,792 --> 01:06:15,335
How many you want?

904
01:06:15,919 --> 01:06:17,587
He's out of his head.

905
01:06:37,273 --> 01:06:38,942
Jim, you come up, then?

906
01:06:39,025 --> 01:06:41,402
- Yeah, I'm really up.
- Fuckin' great!

907
01:06:44,406 --> 01:06:46,241
- Greenwich Village.
- Where?

908
01:06:46,324 --> 01:06:48,368
Greenwich Village, New York.

909
01:07:08,972 --> 01:07:10,974
Geezer with the hair, man.

910
01:07:11,057 --> 01:07:12,976
- Oi, Dave! Dave!
- Yeah?

911
01:07:13,059 --> 01:07:15,520
The one with the hair!
Let's watch. He's brilliant!

912
01:07:15,603 --> 01:07:17,439
- Jim?
- See you there.

913
01:07:17,522 --> 01:07:18,523
Come on!

914
01:07:18,606 --> 01:07:19,607
Monkey! Come dance!

915
01:08:13,286 --> 01:08:14,496
All right, there, Steph?

916
01:08:14,621 --> 01:08:15,663
Hello.

917
01:08:15,789 --> 01:08:17,332
Great dancer, ain't he, eh?

918
01:08:17,457 --> 01:08:19,709
Must be the ace face, eh?

919
01:08:19,834 --> 01:08:21,002
Good-looking.

920
01:08:21,127 --> 01:08:23,088
You wanna dance with a face?

921
01:08:23,171 --> 01:08:25,006
- All right.
- C'mon, then.

922
01:08:36,851 --> 01:08:37,894
C'mon!

923
01:08:38,978 --> 01:08:42,816
Oh, c'mon, let's dance over
there! C'mon, I wanna watch him!

924
01:08:42,899 --> 01:08:44,734
- No, dance here.
- C'mon!

925
01:08:44,818 --> 01:08:46,653
- Where you going?
- To dance!

926
01:08:46,736 --> 01:08:48,279
Oh, dance with yourself!

927
01:09:12,554 --> 01:09:14,013
Look at him!

928
01:09:14,097 --> 01:09:15,348
What's he doin'?

929
01:09:19,602 --> 01:09:23,314
Out the way, son.
Out the way. Come on.

930
01:09:37,078 --> 01:09:38,288
Oi! Bouncers!

931
01:09:39,205 --> 01:09:40,749
Yah!

932
01:09:43,084 --> 01:09:46,421
You're out. Come on, out.

933
01:09:46,504 --> 01:09:49,048
You could've killed
yourself. Come on.

934
01:09:49,174 --> 01:09:51,050
Get off! Leave 'im!

935
01:09:56,848 --> 01:09:58,266
Jimmy!

936
01:09:58,349 --> 01:10:00,602
- Monkey!
- No!

937
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:05,982
Get out and stay out!

938
01:10:58,868 --> 01:11:00,745
Bit of a girl, was she?

939
01:11:00,829 --> 01:11:02,997
- Where to?
- I wanna ride!

940
01:11:03,123 --> 01:11:05,959
I'm findin' somewhere to kip.
You seen Jimmy?

941
01:11:06,042 --> 01:11:07,919
He was bein' kicked out.

942
01:11:08,002 --> 01:11:10,463
- Fenton's pulled again.
- Makes you sick.

943
01:11:10,547 --> 01:11:13,550
He's sorted his sleepin'
arrangements out.

944
01:11:13,633 --> 01:11:17,137
- Let's ride, Chalk!
- No, get some kip.

945
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:19,514
- See ya, Dave.
- Cheerio, Spider.

946
01:11:20,432 --> 01:11:21,933
- Oi, Steph!
- What?

947
01:11:22,016 --> 01:11:23,226
You comin' with us?

948
01:11:23,309 --> 01:11:28,273
No, we're goin' to a bed
and breakfast, ain't we, Shirl?

949
01:11:28,356 --> 01:11:29,691
- Bye.
- See ya.

950
01:11:29,774 --> 01:11:32,569
I wouldn't say no
to bed and breakfast.

951
01:11:32,652 --> 01:11:34,279
I ain't got no dough.

952
01:11:34,362 --> 01:11:35,864
Not you. Them!

953
01:11:35,947 --> 01:11:37,991
Oh. Yeah, not half.

954
01:11:38,658 --> 01:11:39,993
Can you imagine it?

955
01:11:40,076 --> 01:11:42,036
Legs wrapped round your face...

956
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,372
- Fuckin' amazin'.
- Whoo-hoo!

957
01:11:44,456 --> 01:11:46,332
Bit of all right is Steph.

958
01:11:46,458 --> 01:11:49,127
- So where we gonna kip?
- I dunno.

959
01:11:56,509 --> 01:11:59,304
What we gonna do?
Go back to the beach?

960
01:11:59,387 --> 01:12:00,972
Oh, yeah? Can you swim?

961
01:12:07,395 --> 01:12:09,689
I don't wanna sleep anyway.
Do you?

962
01:12:10,815 --> 01:12:11,858
Hey!

963
01:12:16,613 --> 01:12:18,364
What d'you reckon?

964
01:12:22,202 --> 01:12:24,662
It's cheap.

965
01:12:38,301 --> 01:12:40,178
Bit of a shithouse, innit?

966
01:12:40,762 --> 01:12:43,389
I dunno, never slept
in a shithouse, Chalk.

967
01:12:43,473 --> 01:12:44,599
What d'you reckon?

968
01:12:45,308 --> 01:12:47,352
Make your fucking mind up.

969
01:12:47,435 --> 01:12:48,645
..Kin' hell!

970
01:12:51,147 --> 01:12:52,899
Sorry. Is there room?

971
01:15:00,068 --> 01:15:01,569
Come on, then, let's move.

972
01:15:10,703 --> 01:15:12,122
Get a move on.

973
01:15:12,205 --> 01:15:14,624
I've heard there's
a few mods about.

974
01:15:14,707 --> 01:15:15,917
See you down there.

975
01:15:29,472 --> 01:15:30,515
What d'you want?

976
01:15:30,598 --> 01:15:31,683
Bacon sandwich, please.

977
01:15:31,766 --> 01:15:32,767
Spider!

978
01:15:37,522 --> 01:15:38,523
Hello, girls!

979
01:15:39,441 --> 01:15:41,443
- Where's Jim?
- Over there.

980
01:15:41,526 --> 01:15:43,737
Jim! How's the human cannonball
today?

981
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:45,447
Leave me hair alone, Dave!

982
01:15:46,573 --> 01:15:47,699
Eh?

983
01:15:51,536 --> 01:15:53,913
We're in this beach hut,
it's dark, right?

984
01:15:53,997 --> 01:15:56,416
Wakes up this morning,
there's greasers everywhere!

985
01:15:56,499 --> 01:15:59,127
- Right, Dave?
- Yeah, screwing some bird.

986
01:15:59,252 --> 01:16:01,755
Yeah, what did
she look like then?

987
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:04,090
Dunno, we only saw her arse.

988
01:16:04,215 --> 01:16:08,428
But that wasn't rough.
Well, apart from the splinters.

989
01:16:09,137 --> 01:16:12,682
One was the geezer
that rode me off the bike.

990
01:16:12,766 --> 01:16:14,267
He's on my fuckin' list.

991
01:16:15,769 --> 01:16:18,021
All right if I sit down, eh?

992
01:16:18,104 --> 01:16:19,105
Yeah.

993
01:16:20,565 --> 01:16:22,567
What you got the 'ump about?

994
01:16:22,650 --> 01:16:25,528
- Hey?
- Why you so humpy?

995
01:16:25,612 --> 01:16:26,780
Nothing.

996
01:16:26,863 --> 01:16:29,074
Just lookin' at the sea,
that's all.

997
01:16:29,157 --> 01:16:30,158
Oh, yeah?

998
01:16:30,241 --> 01:16:32,160
Christ Almighty.

999
01:16:33,203 --> 01:16:35,163
Take your feet off the table.

1000
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:36,790
Piss off!

1001
01:16:37,373 --> 01:16:40,502
Just watch it or you're out!

1002
01:16:43,755 --> 01:16:45,465
Where'd you get to, then?

1003
01:16:45,548 --> 01:16:48,718
Nowhere!
Just kipped on the beach.

1004
01:16:48,843 --> 01:16:51,805
You're fuckin' mad,
getting chucked out.

1005
01:16:51,888 --> 01:16:55,183
You shoulda stayed around, mush.
You woulda been well in.

1006
01:16:55,266 --> 01:16:56,267
What d'you mean?

1007
01:16:56,351 --> 01:16:58,812
She was all on her Jack Jones.

1008
01:16:58,895 --> 01:16:59,979
Steph?

1009
01:17:00,063 --> 01:17:01,147
Yeah.

1010
01:17:02,649 --> 01:17:05,318
Fucking Fenton gets off
with this beatnik chick.

1011
01:17:05,402 --> 01:17:07,362
And she's all on her own.

1012
01:17:07,445 --> 01:17:11,324
Tell you, I'd have been up her
like a fuckin' ferret!

1013
01:17:11,408 --> 01:17:14,035
Well, if I hadn't known
you were so...

1014
01:17:14,119 --> 01:17:15,120
So what?

1015
01:17:15,203 --> 01:17:17,414
I ain't gone on her, you know?

1016
01:17:17,497 --> 01:17:18,540
Hello, Jimmy!

1017
01:17:18,623 --> 01:17:20,750
Everybody
knows you fancy her.

1018
01:17:20,834 --> 01:17:23,628
I reckon she's a right
good bunk-up.

1019
01:17:23,711 --> 01:17:25,171
Oh, you animal.

1020
01:17:58,621 --> 01:17:59,622
Hi.

1021
01:17:59,706 --> 01:18:02,000
- All right, Steph?
- Yeah, great, innit?

1022
01:18:02,083 --> 01:18:04,919
- Where's Pete, then?
- Dunno. Don't care.

1023
01:18:05,003 --> 01:18:07,547
Don't care?
Dave! Come on. Dave!

1024
01:18:08,465 --> 01:18:11,050
We are the mods,
we are the mods!

1025
01:18:11,176 --> 01:18:13,636
We are, we are, we are the mods!

1026
01:18:18,641 --> 01:18:20,059
Fucking wankers!

1027
01:18:33,948 --> 01:18:37,160
That's the geezer that
run me off the road yesterday!

1028
01:18:38,078 --> 01:18:39,621
Let's fuckin' have 'em!

1029
01:18:49,047 --> 01:18:50,340
Have 'im!

1030
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:58,932
Pete! Stop 'em!

1031
01:18:59,015 --> 01:19:01,059
No!

1032
01:19:07,357 --> 01:19:09,359
They've gone berserk!
Get somebody here!

1033
01:19:09,442 --> 01:19:10,777
What's that... Stop!

1034
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:14,197
Jesus Christ,
they've gone... Oi!

1035
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:18,701
What's goin' on here?!

1036
01:19:22,705 --> 01:19:23,957
Over the edge!

1037
01:19:33,633 --> 01:19:34,717
Jimmy! Jimmy!

1038
01:19:35,093 --> 01:19:38,680
All right! I was there! Mods!

1039
01:19:38,805 --> 01:19:41,474
Mods! Mods! Mods!

1040
01:19:41,558 --> 01:19:46,271
There was a geezer, man, I tell
you, I went, crack! Crack!

1041
01:19:53,194 --> 01:19:55,655
We are the mods,
we are the mods!

1042
01:19:55,739 --> 01:19:58,116
We are, we are, we are the mods!

1043
01:20:00,201 --> 01:20:01,202
Quick!

1044
01:20:01,286 --> 01:20:03,621
Fuckin' hell! Run! Run!

1045
01:20:14,090 --> 01:20:15,884
We are the mods,
we are the mods!

1046
01:20:16,009 --> 01:20:17,719
We are, we are, we are the mods!

1047
01:20:51,669 --> 01:20:53,505
Mods! Mods! Mods!

1048
01:21:01,971 --> 01:21:03,139
We got some rockers!

1049
01:21:10,939 --> 01:21:12,357
Kill the bastards!

1050
01:21:17,821 --> 01:21:19,197
Steph, come on!

1051
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:30,393
Out the way!

1052
01:22:30,852 --> 01:22:33,688
- Come on!
- Wait for me!

1053
01:22:42,447 --> 01:22:44,282
- Steph!
- Jimmy!

1054
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:21,194
Jesus Christ! The Law!

1055
01:23:36,376 --> 01:23:38,294
Right, keep them in!

1056
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,869
Control those kids!

1057
01:24:10,952 --> 01:24:12,787
We are the mods,

1058
01:24:12,871 --> 01:24:14,289
we are the mods!

1059
01:24:14,372 --> 01:24:16,750
We are, we are, we are the mods!

1060
01:24:27,802 --> 01:24:30,388
Run. Run! Run!!

1061
01:24:42,692 --> 01:24:44,652
Up here, up here! Come on.

1062
01:24:50,492 --> 01:24:51,701
Oh...

1063
01:24:52,994 --> 01:24:54,120
Ho...

1064
01:24:55,622 --> 01:24:56,956
Come 'ere.

1065
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,458
Come here.

1066
01:25:29,781 --> 01:25:31,491
Uh... Oh...

1067
01:25:31,574 --> 01:25:32,575
Ooh...

1068
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:47,817
'Ere, c'mon.

1069
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:53,364
Down 'ere.

1070
01:26:55,075 --> 01:26:56,284
Come on!

1071
01:26:59,412 --> 01:27:01,873
Get onto the footpaths!

1072
01:27:04,501 --> 01:27:06,127
Get onto the path!

1073
01:27:15,428 --> 01:27:17,472
Get off! I ain't done nothing!
Go on, go on!

1074
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:22,060
Right, give him here. Come on.

1075
01:27:23,103 --> 01:27:24,562
Steph, come on!

1076
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:29,776
Oh, no.

1077
01:27:31,778 --> 01:27:32,904
Fuck!

1078
01:27:50,004 --> 01:27:51,965
All right, all right!

1079
01:27:52,048 --> 01:27:53,883
Fuck off! Cunt.

1080
01:28:05,145 --> 01:28:09,315
Cheers.

1081
01:28:09,399 --> 01:28:11,025
All right!

1082
01:28:17,449 --> 01:28:20,160
# I feel I'm bein' followed

1083
01:28:21,202 --> 01:28:23,496
# My head is empty

1084
01:28:24,414 --> 01:28:29,377
# Yet every word I say
turns out a sentence

1085
01:28:31,921 --> 01:28:34,507
# Make love to a stranger

1086
01:28:34,924 --> 01:28:37,969
# Just asking for directions

1087
01:28:39,095 --> 01:28:41,347
# Turn from being help

1088
01:28:41,431 --> 01:28:45,685
# To being question...

1089
01:29:12,378 --> 01:29:14,839
Oi, Steph? Are you all right?

1090
01:29:19,427 --> 01:29:23,056
# I see a man
without a problem #

1091
01:29:28,228 --> 01:29:30,688
It seems strange
to see this procession

1092
01:29:30,814 --> 01:29:32,732
of miserable specimens.

1093
01:29:32,816 --> 01:29:35,777
So different from the strutting
hooligans of yesterday,

1094
01:29:35,860 --> 01:29:38,696
who came here to pollute
the air of this town.

1095
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:40,240
Yes.

1096
01:29:40,323 --> 01:29:46,871
These long-haired, mentally
unstable, petty little hoodlums.

1097
01:29:46,955 --> 01:29:53,670
These sordid Caesars, who can
only find courage, like rats,

1098
01:29:53,753 --> 01:29:56,589
by hunting in packs,

1099
01:29:56,673 --> 01:29:59,843
came to Brighton
with the avowed intent

1100
01:29:59,926 --> 01:30:03,388
of interfering with the life
and property of its inhabitants.

1101
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:07,434
And so far as the law
gives us power,

1102
01:30:07,559 --> 01:30:11,438
this court will not fail to use
the prescribed penalties.

1103
01:30:13,231 --> 01:30:16,609
It may, perhaps, discourage you,
and others of your kidney,

1104
01:30:16,693 --> 01:30:19,988
who're infected with this
vicious virus,

1105
01:30:20,071 --> 01:30:23,366
that you be ordered
to pay a fine of £75.

1106
01:30:23,992 --> 01:30:26,035
I'll pay now if you don't mind.

1107
01:30:28,955 --> 01:30:31,166
Haven't got a pen,
have you, Your Honour?

1108
01:30:33,251 --> 01:30:35,003
That's enough, silence!

1109
01:30:35,086 --> 01:30:37,297
Take him away!

1110
01:30:38,923 --> 01:30:41,801
James Michael Cooper.

1111
01:30:48,725 --> 01:30:50,769
You stay right where you are!

1112
01:30:50,894 --> 01:30:53,980
I don't have to ask
where you've been, do I?

1113
01:30:54,064 --> 01:30:57,150
I suppose you think this is
clever? Proud of yourself?

1114
01:30:57,233 --> 01:30:58,401
- No.
- No?

1115
01:30:58,485 --> 01:31:00,487
You was there, weren't you?

1116
01:31:00,570 --> 01:31:01,780
Yeah, we were there.

1117
01:31:01,863 --> 01:31:05,033
And you had more of this filth
with you, didn't you?

1118
01:31:05,575 --> 01:31:07,368
You can look shame-faced,
my lad.

1119
01:31:07,452 --> 01:31:09,913
I've a good mind to get the law.

1120
01:31:09,996 --> 01:31:11,790
- Where'd you get these?
- Dunno.

1121
01:31:11,873 --> 01:31:14,167
- Someone gave 'em to me.
- Oh, did he?

1122
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:16,044
And you had to take 'em?

1123
01:31:16,127 --> 01:31:17,879
- No.
- You've gotta look big.

1124
01:31:17,962 --> 01:31:21,007
If they was rat poison
you'd have taken them anyway?

1125
01:31:21,091 --> 01:31:24,302
Then gone off like savages
ruining everybody's peace!

1126
01:31:24,385 --> 01:31:27,722
I look at you and don't know
what I've brought up!

1127
01:31:27,806 --> 01:31:29,224
Your sister's not like this!

1128
01:31:29,307 --> 01:31:32,018
Ain't she?
What do you fucking know, eh?

1129
01:31:32,143 --> 01:31:35,146
Drugs and filthy pictures!
Running riot over everywhere!

1130
01:31:35,271 --> 01:31:38,775
You're a little animal,
you wanna be locked up!

1131
01:31:39,234 --> 01:31:42,320
Look what I've got!
A bloody mad thing!

1132
01:31:42,404 --> 01:31:43,405
All right.

1133
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:44,864
You're a little savage!

1134
01:31:44,948 --> 01:31:47,200
Get out of my house, go on!

1135
01:31:49,494 --> 01:31:50,662
Get out!

1136
01:31:50,745 --> 01:31:52,747
You're no son of mine!

1137
01:31:52,831 --> 01:31:54,541
Wait till your
father comes home!

1138
01:31:54,624 --> 01:31:56,835
- I'll wait!
- Go on, get out!

1139
01:31:56,918 --> 01:31:58,169
Yeah, fuck off!

1140
01:32:03,883 --> 01:32:06,344
...fuckin' house anyway, eh?

1141
01:32:08,179 --> 01:32:11,224
# Get out
and don't come back no more

1142
01:32:12,392 --> 01:32:15,770
# Get out
and don't come back no more

1143
01:32:16,896 --> 01:32:18,440
# Get out, don't come back

1144
01:32:19,149 --> 01:32:20,775
# Get out, don't come back

1145
01:32:20,859 --> 01:32:22,026
# Get out

1146
01:32:22,110 --> 01:32:26,197
# and don't come back

1147
01:32:26,281 --> 01:32:29,325
# no more #

1148
01:32:35,373 --> 01:32:36,374
Come.

1149
01:32:38,585 --> 01:32:40,003
The post room boy.

1150
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:44,883
Be with you in a minute, Cooper.

1151
01:32:57,020 --> 01:33:00,106
Absent for a full day
last week, Cooper.

1152
01:33:03,193 --> 01:33:08,239
Now, I understand one day's bank
holiday's not enough for you,

1153
01:33:08,323 --> 01:33:10,366
so you have to take two.

1154
01:33:13,161 --> 01:33:15,872
May I enquire if there's
any reason for this?

1155
01:33:16,623 --> 01:33:17,624
Not really.

1156
01:33:17,707 --> 01:33:20,543
Not ill or anything, were you?

1157
01:33:21,252 --> 01:33:22,253
No.

1158
01:33:23,296 --> 01:33:26,925
Mr Cale tells me you spent
the weekend in Brighton.

1159
01:33:27,675 --> 01:33:32,055
I imagine you were involved
in the...disturbances there?

1160
01:33:32,138 --> 01:33:34,224
Yeah, I was there.

1161
01:33:34,307 --> 01:33:37,352
You weren't arrested or
detained or anything, were you?

1162
01:33:37,936 --> 01:33:38,895
No.

1163
01:33:41,564 --> 01:33:45,402
I must say, I find your attitude
fairly incomprehensible.

1164
01:33:46,152 --> 01:33:48,238
I feel I must warn you, Cooper,

1165
01:33:48,321 --> 01:33:50,907
that we cannot tolerate
this kind of absenteeism

1166
01:33:50,990 --> 01:33:52,575
amongst our junior staff.

1167
01:33:52,659 --> 01:33:54,953
You've got a good steady job,
Cooper.

1168
01:33:55,036 --> 01:33:58,832
Plenty of young men'd give their
eye teeth to be in your shoes.

1169
01:33:58,915 --> 01:33:59,916
Yeah?

1170
01:33:59,999 --> 01:34:01,000
Find one, then.

1171
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:04,504
I beg your pardon?

1172
01:34:04,587 --> 01:34:07,048
You heard. Find one, then.

1173
01:34:07,132 --> 01:34:09,968
I'll tell you
what to do with your job.

1174
01:34:10,051 --> 01:34:12,971
You can take that mail,
and that franking machine,

1175
01:34:13,054 --> 01:34:16,433
and all that other rubbish
I have to go about with,

1176
01:34:16,516 --> 01:34:18,601
and you can stuff 'em
right up your arse!

1177
01:34:21,229 --> 01:34:25,358
Hey, Jimmy. You lose a shilling
and find sixpence, eh?

1178
01:34:30,113 --> 01:34:31,740
Well, look who it isn't.

1179
01:34:31,823 --> 01:34:34,159
Jimmy, I thought
they'd locked you up.

1180
01:34:34,617 --> 01:34:37,579
Yeah, I got fined,
didn't I? £50.

1181
01:34:37,662 --> 01:34:38,663
Jesus.

1182
01:34:38,747 --> 01:34:40,540
Another good customer
bites the dust.

1183
01:34:40,623 --> 01:34:44,502
We couldn't wait for you,
had to get back to our jobs.

1184
01:34:44,586 --> 01:34:48,173
Yeah, well, I ain't bothered.
I was with Ace and that.

1185
01:34:48,256 --> 01:34:50,508
Yeah, we went to court together.

1186
01:34:56,139 --> 01:34:57,140
Yeah.

1187
01:34:58,057 --> 01:34:59,058
Yeah.

1188
01:35:00,769 --> 01:35:03,063
Christ,
he's really weird tonight.

1189
01:35:03,146 --> 01:35:05,023
I couldn't give a shit.

1190
01:35:07,067 --> 01:35:08,068
Ferdy?

1191
01:35:08,568 --> 01:35:09,736
Jim?

1192
01:35:10,111 --> 01:35:11,654
You got any blues?

1193
01:35:11,738 --> 01:35:13,531
Yeah, how many you want?

1194
01:35:13,948 --> 01:35:15,617
Dunno. How many you got?

1195
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:17,368
A ton. French blues.

1196
01:35:17,452 --> 01:35:18,620
I'll have the lot.

1197
01:35:18,703 --> 01:35:20,997
- What?
- You can't afford it!

1198
01:35:22,123 --> 01:35:24,042
Where'd you get all that, then?

1199
01:35:25,085 --> 01:35:26,753
Golden hand shake, innit?

1200
01:35:26,836 --> 01:35:28,254
Two weeks' money.

1201
01:35:28,338 --> 01:35:31,674
Told him to stuff the job
right up his arse.

1202
01:35:32,133 --> 01:35:34,636
You sure you want the whole bag?

1203
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:36,930
Yeah. Why not, eh? Why not?

1204
01:35:37,013 --> 01:35:38,056
All right.

1205
01:35:38,139 --> 01:35:39,265
A fiver.

1206
01:35:41,059 --> 01:35:42,143
Fiver.

1207
01:35:46,898 --> 01:35:49,109
What you gonna do with that lot?

1208
01:35:49,234 --> 01:35:51,277
Start a one-man riot?

1209
01:35:51,361 --> 01:35:52,445
Yeah. I might.

1210
01:35:54,114 --> 01:35:55,782
Why'd you chuck your job?

1211
01:35:55,865 --> 01:35:57,575
'Cos I felt like it.

1212
01:35:57,659 --> 01:35:59,411
Well, you're bleedin' nutty.

1213
01:35:59,494 --> 01:36:01,788
You was on a cushy number.

1214
01:36:01,871 --> 01:36:04,541
Look, don't give it
all that, right?

1215
01:36:04,624 --> 01:36:07,919
I just got fed up.
Fancied something outdoors.

1216
01:36:08,128 --> 01:36:09,546
So do I.

1217
01:36:11,673 --> 01:36:13,299
She's not bad, is she?

1218
01:36:13,383 --> 01:36:16,136
I found her by the road
in Brighton.

1219
01:36:56,259 --> 01:36:59,179
See you found yourself
a new little boy, then?

1220
01:37:02,557 --> 01:37:03,808
Hey, Jimmy?

1221
01:37:03,892 --> 01:37:05,935
Hope you find a new job.

1222
01:37:06,436 --> 01:37:07,771
Oh, yeah?

1223
01:37:07,854 --> 01:37:11,066
I could get you a job
on the rubbish carts?

1224
01:37:12,567 --> 01:37:15,403
You're good at going
up and down in alleys.

1225
01:37:29,417 --> 01:37:33,088
If I see you round 'ere again
I'll fuckin' kill you!

1226
01:37:33,171 --> 01:37:35,256
- Get off me!
- What's the matter?

1227
01:37:36,091 --> 01:37:37,300
You're not a face!

1228
01:37:37,383 --> 01:37:39,385
- Piss off!
- You piss off!

1229
01:37:39,469 --> 01:37:40,470
Forget her, Jimmy!

1230
01:37:40,553 --> 01:37:45,100
Shut up and piss off. You're all
wankers and cunts. Wankers!

1231
01:38:31,604 --> 01:38:34,065
Jimmy!
Pack that in and clear off!

1232
01:38:34,149 --> 01:38:36,443
What d'you want,
you old spunker, eh?

1233
01:38:36,568 --> 01:38:40,447
Eh? What d'you
want? What d'you want?

1234
01:38:47,495 --> 01:38:49,706
I'll have you,
you little bastard!

1235
01:38:59,716 --> 01:39:00,925
Are you mad?

1236
01:39:01,009 --> 01:39:03,887
What's the matter with you?
You're worse than he is!

1237
01:39:03,970 --> 01:39:04,971
Come on in!

1238
01:39:05,054 --> 01:39:06,931
You'll wake the whole street.

1239
01:39:07,015 --> 01:39:09,309
It's a bit late for that!

1240
01:39:09,392 --> 01:39:12,020
If he comes
here again I'll kill him!

1241
01:39:12,103 --> 01:39:14,856
Can't you
come in and talk about it?

1242
01:39:14,939 --> 01:39:17,358
Do they all have to know
our business?

1243
01:40:52,829 --> 01:40:53,913
Hello, Steph.

1244
01:40:54,289 --> 01:40:55,999
What you doin' here?

1245
01:40:56,833 --> 01:40:58,334
I wanted to see you.

1246
01:40:58,418 --> 01:40:59,711
You've seen me, OK?

1247
01:40:59,794 --> 01:41:01,671
Wait a minute, will ya?

1248
01:41:01,755 --> 01:41:03,965
What you gonna do? Beat me up?

1249
01:41:04,048 --> 01:41:06,259
What d'you want?
Come on, I'm late.

1250
01:41:07,510 --> 01:41:11,181
Well... I left home last night.

1251
01:41:11,264 --> 01:41:13,349
I kipped out, didn't I?

1252
01:41:13,433 --> 01:41:14,851
In some nuthouse?

1253
01:41:14,934 --> 01:41:16,728
Look, I ain't mad!

1254
01:41:16,811 --> 01:41:19,314
What is wrong with you, then?

1255
01:41:19,397 --> 01:41:20,440
Well, I dunno.

1256
01:41:20,523 --> 01:41:24,110
It's just...it seems like
everything's going backwards.

1257
01:41:24,194 --> 01:41:25,195
Steph?

1258
01:41:26,446 --> 01:41:29,949
You sure it's not you
going backwards?

1259
01:41:30,033 --> 01:41:33,787
No, it's just... I can't
think straight, that's all.

1260
01:41:33,870 --> 01:41:37,415
I mean, nothing seems right,
apart from Brighton.

1261
01:41:37,499 --> 01:41:41,795
Brighton was OK, going to court
with the Ace and that.

1262
01:41:41,878 --> 01:41:44,422
I was a mod there, you know?

1263
01:41:44,506 --> 01:41:46,508
I mean, that's something,
innit, eh?

1264
01:41:46,591 --> 01:41:48,802
What are you talkin' about?

1265
01:41:48,885 --> 01:41:51,763
Brighton was a laugh,
that's why we went down there.

1266
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:57,435
Oh, yeah. And me and you, then?
Was that just a giggle?

1267
01:41:57,519 --> 01:41:59,062
Oh, what do you think?

1268
01:42:00,313 --> 01:42:01,981
All right, so I fancied you.

1269
01:42:02,065 --> 01:42:05,068
We had it off.
But that don't mean nothin'.

1270
01:42:05,151 --> 01:42:06,903
It did to fuckin' me.

1271
01:42:07,028 --> 01:42:08,988
I can't help that, can I?

1272
01:42:09,114 --> 01:42:11,658
If I'd known you'd go mad,
I wouldn't have.

1273
01:42:11,783 --> 01:42:14,494
I told you, I ain't
fuckin' mad, right?

1274
01:42:14,577 --> 01:42:16,287
No, not much. Look at you?

1275
01:42:16,371 --> 01:42:19,582
One minute you're all right,
next minute you're going stupid.

1276
01:42:19,666 --> 01:42:23,294
You can't have a bit without
kicking your mates' head in.

1277
01:42:23,378 --> 01:42:26,005
Just leave me alone,
Jimmy! All right?

1278
01:42:26,089 --> 01:42:28,550
Steph, please. Steph, please!

1279
01:42:28,633 --> 01:42:30,051
Fuck off!

1280
01:42:30,885 --> 01:42:32,512
You slag!

1281
01:42:32,595 --> 01:42:34,681
Ah, you cunt!

1282
01:42:35,932 --> 01:42:37,475
Bastard! Cunt!

1283
01:42:51,364 --> 01:42:53,742
What the bloody hell you doin'?

1284
01:42:53,867 --> 01:42:55,368
We could've killed you!

1285
01:42:55,452 --> 01:42:56,619
Hey?

1286
01:42:57,370 --> 01:42:58,538
Look at this.

1287
01:42:58,621 --> 01:43:03,168
Ah, fuckin' hell!
Look what you've done!

1288
01:43:03,251 --> 01:43:05,044
You cunts!

1289
01:43:05,128 --> 01:43:06,921
