1
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,650
深呼吸  并且从头开始
Take a deep breath and start at the beginning.

2
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,100
告诉他们我们第一次是如何相遇的
Tell them how we first met.

3
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,670
嗨  嗨
Hi. Hi.

4
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,850
告诉他们
Tell them that

5
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,180
自从那时起  我们分享彼此的梦
ever since we shared our dreams...

6
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,660
我昨晚做了一个梦
I had a dream last night.

7
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,960
那是艾力克斯最奇怪的一个梦
...even Alex's weirdest ones.

8
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,990
你知道划艇吗
You know a rowing boat?

9
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,930
你知道艇上有小圈圈  使桨固定在艇上吗
That little curvy bit the oar sits in?

10
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,530
-顺代带一提它叫桨锁  -一个什么
-It's called a rollock by the way. -A what?

11
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,540
桨锁  像是念"bollock"  只是用"R"当开头
Rollock, like "bollock" with an "R."

12
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,810
那玩意是我  我是那玩意
That was me. I was that thing.

13
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,680
不  让它变成我们的小秘密吧
No. Keep that as our secret.

14
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,980
罗茜  罗茜  是时候罗
Rosie? Rosie, it's time.

15
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,120
告诉他们这是
Tell them that this is,

16
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,880
这一定必须是
that this has to be...

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,700
所有人注意一下
Everybody!

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,810
这是在我人生中  最快乐的一天
...one of the happiest days of my life.

19
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,040
拜托
Please!

20
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,370
对那些我还没
For those I haven't had the

21
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,460
打过招呼的朋友们  你们好
chance to say hi to properly,

22
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,490
我是罗茜
I'm Rosie.

23
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,860
而这一定是
And this has got to be

24
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,630
我人生中最快乐的一天
one of the happiest days of my life.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,850
十二年前  罗茜的18岁生日
虽然因为喝太醉而没什么印象了

26
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,680
再一杯
Shots!

27
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,890
碧昂丝
Yeah! Beyonce!

28
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,940
-嗨  艾力克斯  -最近如何啊  兄弟
-Hi, Alex. -How's it going, mate?

29
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,850
还行啦
All right.

30
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,250
是艾力克斯欧
It's Alex!

31
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,550
这整件事都是我的错
It was totally my fault, the whole thing.

32
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,650
我真的很想相信你艾力克斯  真的
Oh, I'd love to believe you, Alex, I really would.

33
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,520
我了解我女儿是什么样子
I just happen to know my own daughter.

34
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,790
你会成为一个杰出的医生
A fine doctor you're gonna make

35
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,490
如果你继续朝这方面前进的话
if this is how you carry on.

36
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,260
为什么大家都在大叫
Why is everybody shouting?

37
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,500
昨晚我真的非常抱歉
I'm so embarrassed about last night.

38
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,170
不不不  你不要这样说
No, no, you don't have to be.

39
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,910
我昨天的行为简直糟透了
Ugh, I behaved so badly!

40
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,710
是没错  不过糟也可以是好事啊
Yeah, but bad can be good, too.

41
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,150
好事  它超级糟的好吗
Good? It was awful.

42
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,300
我光是想到这件事  就想要要吐了
Oh, I feel sick even thinking about it.

43
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,960
哪个部份
About which part?

44
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,190
全部  它从来没发生过
All of it. It never happened.

45
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,060
艾力克斯  不要讲出去好吗  你千万别跟任何人讲
Alex, okay? You can't tell anyone!

46
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,100
好啦
Right.

47
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,070
撤  撤  撤
Go, go, go!

48
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,140
我们怎么从医院回家的啊
How did we get home from the hospital?

49
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,140
我妈带我们回来的
Uh, Mom picked us up.

50
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,610
他们需要父母的名字
They needed a parent's name,

51
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,240
所以  很明显的我不应该交出你父母的名字
so, I obviously didn't want to give yours.

52
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,850
然后她觉得这都是我的错
And she thinks it's my fault anyway,

53
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,310
我会带来坏的影响力啊
I'm a terrible influence. Blah, blah, blah.

54
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,820
你是啊
Oh, well, you are.

55
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,190
所以  现在我必须每天花两小时
So, now, I have to spend two hours

56
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,790
待在图书馆里面两星期
in the library every day for a fortnight.

57
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,860
-恶梦啊  -其实它还有可能更糟呢
-Nightmare. -Well, it could be worse.

58
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,060
贝瑟尼·威廉姆斯刚刚  在那里获得一分兼职工作
Bethany Williams has just got a part time job there.

59
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,200
是
Yeah, right.

60
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,000
什么
What?

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,930
贝瑟尼·威廉姆斯
Bethany Williams?

62
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,800
忘了吧  虽然连我都想跟她上床
Forget it, even I want to sleep with her.

63
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:21,110
依你的观点来看  她曾经用眼神给我暗示
For your information, she has been giving me the eye.

64
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,610
你为啥不把你前额的痘痘挤掉呢
why you haven't squeezed that zit on your forehead.

65
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,080
-去你的  -不不不  过来给姊姊看  我可以帮你挤
-Fuck off! -No. Come here. I can do it for you.

66
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,120
别碰我  你这家伙
Don't touch me! Don't you dare!

67
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,420
现在看着格雷格的那家伙
Just look at Greg right now.

68
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,850
根本花花公子一个
What a bimbo.

69
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,620
他邀请我去学校的舞会
He invited me to the school dance.

70
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,630
什么  那你怎么回答
Uh, what did you say?

71
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,860
别惊讶  很明显的  我会跟你一起去的啦
No, obviously. I'm going with you.

72
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,930
艾力克斯
Hey, Alex.

73
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,130
我今天在图书馆里怎么没看到你呢
I missed you in the library today.

74
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,670
我没有任何
Yeah, uh, I had nothing...

75
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,310
我是说  我是有一点有一点忙
Uh, I mean, yeah. I was a bit... A bit of busy...

76
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,680
不要忘了我
Don't be a stranger. Yeah.

77
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,180
绝对不会的
Yeah, absolutely not.

78
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,780
我们图书馆见
I'll see you there.

79
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,120
-女孩们  -他跟你讲什么啊
-Hey, girls! -What did he say to you?

80
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,380
别这么可悲啊
Pathetic.

81
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,950
她只是想打个招呼罢了
She's mine for the taking.

82
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,990
你很幸运她没有让你吃螺丝
You're lucky she didn't trip over your tongue

83
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,120
并且拖着你的舌头穿越过这里
dragging halfway across the ground.

84
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,890
好啦  我知道啦
Whoa. Okay. All right.

85
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,830
好吧  既然你这么在行  给我点意见
Well, give me some tips then, if you are so clever.

86
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,330
我要如何诱惑一个女人
How do I go about seducing a woman

87
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,400
谁很明显的不是我能追到的
who is apparently out of my league?

88
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,800
-你是认真的  -没错  当然
-Is that a serious question? -Yeah, absolutely.

89
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,770
好吧  你是"那个"条件比较不利的
Mmm, well, you're at a disadvantage

90
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,740
"那个"你知道的  处男
being a, you know, virgin.

91
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,380
不  不  不  别担心
No, no, no, all right?

92
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,150
我们可以改变它
We can work with that.

93
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,380
首先  你要变酷  忽视她
First you have to be cool. Ignore her.

94
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,020
表现的像是你随时可以把她  也可以甩她
Act like you could take it or leave it.

95
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,820
你看  这我可要好好练一下
You see, that I've had practice at. Hmm.

96
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,090
第二  你要让她觉得
Uh, second, you have to make her feel like

97
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,190
你从她身上看到某些独一无二的特质
you've seen something in her no one else has.

98
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,690
像是她的灵魂
Like her soul.

99
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,690
在忽视她的同时
While also ignoring her?

100
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,230
当然
Yes.

101
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,000
好吧  那有什么跟打炮有关的呢
Okay, and what happened to the sex?

102
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,900
这就是跟打炮有关的啊
This is about the sex!

103
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,130
靠  你讲的这个真他妈的操蛋
God! You're so fucked up.

104
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,700
你绝对想像不到
Mmm. You have no idea.

105
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,380
她要我带她去舞会
She wants me to take her to the dance.

106
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:39,980
真的
Really?

107
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,380
想像啦
Yeah, imagine.

108
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,390
带她去  假如她对你来说这么重要的话
Take her, if it means that much to you.

109
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,460
拜托  这样你会没舞伴的
Come on. You'd have no one to go with.

110
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,030
我才刚被本年级最适合的舞伴问过好吗  艾力克斯
I got asked by the fittest guy in our year, Alex.

111
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,870
我觉得我没问题
I think I'm fine.

112
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:05,000
什么  所以这对你没造成任何困扰咯
What, so actually this is quite convenient for you.

113
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,910
好吧  既然这样  那我去问她能不能和我一起参加
All right. Well, yeah, I'll go ask her then.

114
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,280
去吧
Go for it.

115
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,390
好吧  我会去问的
Okay. Fine, I will.

116
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,760
贝瑟尼  贝瑟尼  嗨
Bethany? Bethany, hi.

117
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,930
好啊
Yeah!

118
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,350
-你的脸真的很烦耶  一直冒头  -得了
-Your face is annoying me. -Come on.

119
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,220
-我有新消息  -我也是
-I've got news. -Me, too.

120
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,300
我要专心上课  这样考试才会过
I need to concentrate so I can pass my exams

121
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,900
然后过着爽爽生活
and get a life.

122
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,640
我脱离处男了

123
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,000
哈罗  还在吗

124
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,300
哪个女的这么倒霉

125
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,380
千万不要是贝瑟尼
Not Bethany!

126
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:28,760
贝瑟尼

127
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,120
干你娘
Fuck!

128
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:31,970
那个罗茜·邓恩
Right, Rosie Dunne,

129
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,290
自己到校长办公室报到
get yourself down to the headmaster's office.

130
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,230
不  不  不  这都是我的错  辛普森先生
No, no, no, it was my fault, Mr. Simpson.

131
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,070
我有一些必须告诉她的话
I had something I needed to tell her.

132
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,570
好吧我了解了  艾力克斯  恭喜你
So I see, Alex. Congratulations.

133
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,940
没错  艾力克斯
Yes, Alex!

134
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,610
我知道我们不是正式地谈话
I know we're not officially talking,

135
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,280
但是我需人帮我绑领结
but I need help with my tie.

136
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,210
有那么一分钟  我想你可能
For a minute there, I thought you might be

137
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,550
爱上我了或什么呢
in love with me or something.

138
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,650
艾力克斯  你在我心永远都是那个
Alex, you will forever be the boy

139
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,290

Who knows?

152
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,060
所以  这个工具男跟你约在哪
So, where is this tool meant to be meeting you?

153
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,000

You're so rude! Um, I think at the front.

154
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,100

176
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,790
天啊  挫屎了

罗茜  你找到它没

178
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,810

Do you want me to have a look for you?

179
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,180
-真的  -当然  你趴下来我帮你找

No, wait, you've got to help me,

184
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,800

185
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,660

不  不  不  抱歉  没事
No, no, no, sorry, no,

187
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,230
我就是说没事的意思  什么事都没有
that's what I meant. Everything's fine.

188
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,700
天哪  你吓到我了
Jesus, you scared me!

189
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,200
我是说  有些意外发生了  跟那个工具男有关
I mean, there was an accident, um, with the thingy

190
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,670
就是那个格雷格  你知道
with Greg, you know?

191
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,770
-这样的事常发生  罗茜  -不  不  艾力克斯
-Well, that happens, Rosie! -No, no, Alex.

192
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,370
发生了我需要立刻解决的事你懂吗  艾力克斯
Something that I need to figure out right now, Alex.

193
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,440
我需要取出它
I need to get rid of it.

194
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,150
它不见了  然后我找不到它又不知道要怎么做
It got lost and I can't find it and I don't know what to do.

195
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,150
你讲的我完全听不懂啊  罗茜
You're not making any sense, Rosie!

196
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,550
你能不能等一下再讲这些
Can we just talk about this later?

197
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,720
不要啊  艾力克斯  拜托
No, Alex, please!

198
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,620
好吧  那你要讲的非常清楚  准确
Okay, you need to be really clear and really precise!

199
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,720
好吧
Okay!

200
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,790
保险套掉下来卡在我阴道里
The condom came off inside my vagina

201
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,560
然后现在我不知道它在哪里
and at present I'm unable to locate it!

202
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,570
这比我需要知道的多多了
That's way more information than I needed.

203
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,370
嗨  我是迪克医生
Hi. I'm Dick.

204
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,480
当然  你当然是
Of course, you are.

205
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,250
好勒
Okay.

206
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:37,050
好吧那你是哪种体位前后  背后
Is it, um, front bottom or back?

207
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,190
你以为我是做什么的
What do you think I am?

208
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,690
抱歉  我并没有说你是一个贱什么或者妓什么
Sorry. I wasn't suggesting you're a slag or anything.

209
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,770
这里没有女性护士吗
Isn't there a female nurse?

210
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,210
很抱歉  这里就我啦
I'm afraid I'm all you've got.

211
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,730
那真是我最想死的一刻
That was one of the most embarrassing

212
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,960
在这悲惨人生之中
moments of my entire pathetic existence.

213
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,810
你知道吗
You know what?

214
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,410
让我们离开这鬼地方
Let's get out of here.

215
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,310
Dino's应该还开着吧
Dino's should still be open.

216
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,750
我是在说像波士顿  麻萨诸塞州
I was thinking more Boston, Massachusetts.

217
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,890
你想我应该逃离这国家
Oh, you think I should flee the country?

218
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,720
我很认真
I'm serious.

219
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,330
这地方就是个死路
This place is a dead end,

220
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,560
我们讲好几年了
we've been saying it for years.

221
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,900
我爸希望我可以试试哈佛的奖学金
And, uh, my dad wants me to try for a scholarship at Harvard.

222
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,910
你认真
You are serious.

223
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,380
它是世上最好的医学院之一
It's one of the best medical schools in the world.

224
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,580
然后波士顿大学有
And Boston College happens to have

225
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,420
非常不错的旅馆经营课程
a really great hotel management course.

226
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,660
那是你想要去做的  不是吗
That is what you want to do, isn't it?

227
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,500
你不可以去
You can't!

228
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,670
我是说  谁帮你洗衣物
I mean, who'll do your washing?

229
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,770
你在那会饿死的  这太扯了
You'll never eat! It's ridiculous!

230
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,340
美国有食物的  妈
They have food in America, Mom,

231
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,700
然后我想那边也有洗衣机的
and I'm guessing washing machines.

232
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,770
它太远了
It's so far away!

233
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,510
帮忙说句话啊  丹尼斯
I mean, talk to her, Dennis!

234
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,580
我行的  我来多远就能获得多少啊
It works for me. I mean, this is as far as I got.

235
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,650
我知道  但是妈你的就只是你的懂吗
I know, but Mom's just being Mom.

236
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,580
它将会非常有趣的  而且它将会
It would be so much fun, and it would be...

237
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,520
你曾想要更多吗  老爸
Did you ever want more, Dad?

238
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,630
你知道奶奶最喜欢说的一句话是什么吗
Do you know what your Gran's favorite phrase was?

239
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,780
"不是我们喜欢就好"
"Not for the likes of us."

240
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,930
当你告诉我们你的计划
When you told us of your plan,

241
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,700
它是第一个进入我脑海中的想法
it was the first thing that popped into my head.

242
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,630
我仍然可以听到她在房间讲这句话的声音
I could hear her voice in the room saying it.

243
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,800
我不希望这句话的声音在你脑袋里  永远
I don't want that voice in your head, ever.

244
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,810
这里啦  让我来
Here, let me.

245
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,920
我希望有一天可以拥有自己的旅馆
I want my own hotel one day.

246
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,950
这样想会不会很疯狂啊
Is it crazy to think like that?

247
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,860
我已经这样想18年了
I've been winging it with you for 18 years,

248
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,990
假装我是那个经营人
pretending I was the one in charge.

249
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,630
你很棒的  罗茜
You're amazing, Rosie.

250
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,860
没什么是你办不到的
There's nothing you can't do,

251
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,800
假如你全心去做的话
if you put your mind to it.

252
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,630
但是我要是跑去波士顿  妈就永远不跟我讲话了耶
But if I go to Boston, Mom will never speak to me again.

253
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,800
但是  如果你不去  那我就不跟你讲话
Well, if you don't go, I won't.

254
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,600
选择权在你
The choice is yours.

255
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,040
丹尼斯
Dennis!

256
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,110
顺便帮我一个忙
And do me a favor.

257
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,950
回来并且取得那笨蛋的职位
Come back and take that prick's job.

258
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,060
晚上好
Good evening!

259
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,620
亲爱的邓恩小姐  恭喜你
"Dear Miss Dunne, congratulations!"

260

"We are pleased to offer you a seat at Boston University!"

261
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,630

Oh, my God! Oh, my God! No way! Oh, my God!

262
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,080

Oh, hey, Clare, is Alex in?

263

He'll be down in about three minutes?

266

喝杯茶
Cup of tea?

267
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,170

272
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,550
-真的很忙  -你其实是在讲

276
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,030
你哪学来  你哪学来
Where did you learn "Where did you learn

277
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,900
这样干的  这样干的"
to do that? "to do that?"

278
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,140
我知道  这超恶的
I know. It's so gross.

279
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,620
哈罗
Hello?

280
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,220
干  我来了啦
Fuck! I'm coming!

281
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,880
你可以在这抽烟
Are you supposed to smoke in here?

282
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,980
我爸妈拥有这间店  他们要我在这帮忙
My parents own the place. They want me to help out?

283
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,310
那规矩就是我订的
I'll set the terms.

284
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,910
需要什么
What's up?

285
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,780
好吧  我最近每天都像是生病了
Oh, right. Um, I've been feeling sick like, every day.

286
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,270
或许你可以给我一点药或是什么的
Maybe you could just give me a pill or something...

287
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,550
-有腹泻吗  -没
-Any diarrhea? -No.

288
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,680
-发烧  -没
-Fever? -No.

289
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,180
-胃痉挛  -没
-Stomach cramps? -No.

290
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,620
那好  你有一阵子月经没来
Well, have you missed a period?

291
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,320
对
Yeah.

292
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,130
-糟了  -处女
-Uh, no. -Virgin?

293
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,150
不是  但是我有吃事后避孕药啊
No, but I took the morning-after pill!

294
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,670
90%安全  10%中大奖
90% safe. 10% is the catch.

295
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,640
这个是验孕棒  如果你想用的话
There's a loo here if you want to use it.

296
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,780
挫屎  挫屎  挫屎
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

297
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,770
你真的挫屎了
Bollocks.

298
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,090
艾力克斯你在吗  我们可以见个面吗
Alex are you there? Can we meet?

299
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,280
我很想去  但是贝瑟尼的爸妈
I'd love to, but Bethany's parents

300
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,250
想要去出吃晚餐  在Hazel
are taking us out to dinner at the Hazel.

301
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,450
那里超豪华的
How posh is that?

302
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:49,980
真是啊  去你的贝瑟尼
去你的她有钱的父母  去你的Hazel和去你的

303
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,930
好的  好好享受

304
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,470
好吧  打扰了
Okay. I'm sorry.

305
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,710
我  我
Um, I... I...

306
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,440
我有新消息
I've got news.

307
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,980
-我也是  -读它
-Me, too. -Read it.

308
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,020
有奖学金去哈佛念了
Scholarship to Harvard!

309
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:35,430
艾力克斯  这太棒了  恭喜
Alex, that's so great. Congratulations.

310
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:38,730
这简直难以相信  对吧
It's unbelievable, right?

311
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,510
你有波士顿大学的回信了吗  有吗
Have you heard back from Boston College, yet?

312
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,370
没有
No.

313
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,140
你将会进去的
Yeah, you'll get in.

314
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,740
贝瑟尼怎么办  你有留住她吗
Yeah, what about Bethany? Have you told her?

315
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,380
她会没问题的啦
She'll be fine.

316
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,510
她得到了这个  天啊  她得到的那玩意跟我的头发有关
She's got this... Oh, God, she's got this thing about my hair.

317
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,880
但她硬是猛拉它
But she literally yanks it.

318
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,350
而且她在做爱时摆出一副拉长了的马脸
And she pulls this funny face during sex like this...

319
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,250
-够了  够了  -我想她很像它
-Enough. Enough... -I think she likes it.

320
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,860
你都不觉得你应该
Don't you care what she's gonna think

321
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,290
关心一下她对于你仓促离开怎么想吗
about you rushing off like this?

322
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,260
这是怎么了
All right, what is it?

323
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,260
什么怎么了
What?

324
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,360
就是  你在保护贝瑟尼啊  你怎么了啊
Well, you're defending Bethany. What's wrong?

325
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,900
没事  没怎样
Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

326
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,470
我想你应该是要更开心一点的
I thought you'd be happier.

327
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:21,410
我们在去波士顿的路上  冲啊
We're on our way to Boston! Come on! Hey?

328
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,810
这很棒  真的很棒
It's great. It's great, really.

329
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,440
干得好
Well done.

330
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,530
怎么了  别这样  你也会来的啊
What, come on, you're coming, too!

331
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,280
我的航班在三天后
My flight's in three days,

332
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,490
那让我可以在飞走前安排一些事
which gives me time to get settled in before term starts.

333
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,120
你需要的是前进和预订你的机票
You need to go ahead and book your ticket.

334
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,360
没错
Sure.

335
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,290
我得先帮我的东西好好的分类一下
I have got some stuff to sort first,

336
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:43,260
但是我会在那的
but I'll be there.

337
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,840
-别被恐怖份子炸掉啦  -没问题
-Don't get blown up by terrorists. -Okay.

338
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,210
或是在飞机上失去舱压而被吸出去天空
Or lose cabin pressure and fall out of the sky.

339
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,040
罗茜  等等  等等  等等
Rosie, wait, wait, wait...

340
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
或者飞进一群鸟之间  我很认真
Or fly into a flock of birds. I mean it!

341
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,840
我可以推迟些  如果你需要我的话
I can delay, if you need me to.

342
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,310
不  你要搭上这班飞机
No. You're getting on that plane.

343
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:05,050
我要拿走你某些东西  闭上你的眼睛
I've got you something. Close your eyes.

344
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,020
闭上你的眼睛
Close your eyes.

345
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,090
给我你的手指  好的  让它保持在那
Give me your finger. Okay. Keep it there.

346
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,070
北美洲
North America.

347
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,550
保持联络  好吗
Keep in touch, okay?

348
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,660
好
Okay.

349
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,230
两周后见  所以
See you in two weeks, so...

350
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,210
波士顿
Boston.

351
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,280
这一边
This way?

352
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,940
如果我告诉了他  他就绝对不会离开了
If I'd told him, he'd never have left

353
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,110
而他的人生也就全毁了
and his whole life would have been ruined, too.

354
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,640
我的意思是  论点在哪啊
I mean, what's the point?

355
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,340
多高贵啊  我会让这混蛋留下来陪我
How noble. I'd have forced the bastard to stay.

356
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,210
不  不  不  他不是爸爸
Oh, no, no. He's not the dad.

357
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,210
爸爸只是某个窝囊废
That's just some other loser.

358
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,080
你证明了你是一个
You are turning out to be

359
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,350
比外表看起来要有趣多了的人呢
a lot more interesting than you look.

360
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,420
你为什么不把小孩拿掉呢
Why don't you just get rid of the thing?

361
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,660
我的父母是天主教徒
My parents are Catholic.

362
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,560
我并不全然相信那些  但是我不能这样做
I don't believe in all that, but I can't!

363
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,490
我完全了解啦
Oh, I had it all sussed!

364
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,000
搬去波士顿  读书  拿到好的工作
Move to Boston, study, get a great job,

365
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,300
27岁时回来并且开一间旅馆
at 27, come back and open a hotel.

366
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,970
然后结婚并且生小孩
Then get married and have kids.

367
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,570
一生的重大事件都列出来了
Wow. A whole life in bullet points.

368
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,140
是啊  但现在  它只是怀孕
Yeah, well now, it's pregnant,

369
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,410
有小孩  全职妈妈
have sprog, full-time mother,

370
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:45,140
跟事业说拜拜  靠津贴过活  变肥  剪短发
wave goodbye to career, live off benefits, grow fat, lose hair.

371
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,450
是啊  你就像在扼杀你自己一样
Yeah. You might as well just kill yourself now.

372
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,980
我可以为这些药分类
I can sort the drugs.

373
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,780
在外面有一卡车的人们
Look. There's loads of people out there

374
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,450
想着要小孩却得不到一个
that want a kid that can't have one.

375
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,990
把这孩子送人吧
Give it away.

376
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,630
我还是可以去波士顿
I could still move to Boston.

377
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,600
我也可以再一次申请大学或者工作  我不在乎
I can apply to college again, or get a job. I don't care.

378
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,730
所以这一切都会一样如常  只要撑过六个月
So it would all be the same, just six months later.

379
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,200
我甚至不用告诉艾力克斯
I don't even need to tell Alex,

380
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,070
我只要想要好藉口就好啦
I could just think of an excuse.

381
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,240
那是不错的计划  宝贝
Whoa. That's major denial, babe.

382
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,140
我只是刚好想到  这也是一种方法
I just happen to think it's the way to go.

383
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,690
谁在那啊  艾力克斯
Who's that? Alex.

384
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,320
你告诉他没有
Have you told him yet?

385
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,190
我有寄给他我到达波士顿的时间
I'm sending him my arrival time in Boston.

386
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,660
他只需要知道这些
That's all he needs to know.

387
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,090
女孩  这些小谎言会永远跟着你的
Oh. All this fibbing is gonna catch up with you, girl.

388
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,170
那玩意从她体内胀爆的方式
The way that thing burst out of her.

389
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,540
说不定也会发生在你身上  说不定
That might happen to you! It might.

390
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:45,700
她的肚子会整个爆开来
Her whole belly will erupt.

391
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,240
血跟肠子
Blood and guts.

392
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,750
然后诡异的外星人就会
And this freakish alien will

393
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,410
从肚子跳出来咬掉你的头
leap out and bite your head off!

394
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,310
停下来  你们两个都是
Stop it, the pair of you!

395
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,250
怀孕是一件神圣的事
Pregnancy is a sacred thing!

396
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,220
-它又听不到  -可以的  它听得到好吗
-It can't hear us. -Yes, it can!

397
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,720
还有不要提起她时用它来代替
And don't refer to it as "it."

398
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,290
她是个女孩  如果你一定要知道的话
It's a girl if you must know.

399
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,150
你发现的
You found out?

400
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,060
最近一次扫瞄时问的
I asked at the last scan.

401
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:05,730
我想我应该跟社工讲
I thought I should tell the social worker

402
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:06,630
这样他就可以开始为她计划
so he can start his plans.

403
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,520
-一个女孩  -她叫什么啊
-A girl! -What about names?

404
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,230
不知道  应该说我会让她的新父母决定  她的名字
No, um, I'll let the new parents decide.

405
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,440
给我们偷看一下
Give us a peek.

406
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,060
一个女人的身体可不会因为
A woman's body doesn't become public property

407
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,270
怀孕而变成公众财产
just because she is pregnant.

408
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,410
那就当我的客人吧
Be my guest.

409
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,650
看这个
Look at that!

410
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,640
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

411
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,560
她在打嗝耶
She's got hiccups!

412
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,610
小东西在打嗝耶
Little thing's got hiccups!

413
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,630
简直天赐
Oh, bless!

414
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,300
不管怎样说
Whatever.

415
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,180
宝贝  你听得见我说话吗
Baby, can you hear me?

416
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,530
我试着去感受你的呼吸  像这样
Try holding your breath like this.

417
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,730
*凯蒂有纯洁的意思
你就在这  凯蒂小女孩
There you are, Katie girl!

418
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,400
这可能不会是你的名字  好吗
That's probably not going to be your name, okay?

419
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:36,650
她要出来了  毛巾  热水
It's coming! Towels! Hot water!

420
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,720
-助产士在哪  -我不知道
-Where's the midwife? -I don't know!

421
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,390
现在赶来啦
Come in now!

422
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,350
快上来
Come on!

423
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,260
来啦  助产士在这
Come on! Midwife's here!

424
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,830
那就开始吧  你喜欢多快就多快好吗
Let's go! As quick as you like!

425
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,330
她刚刚才到走廊
She's just right down the hallway.

426
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,660
好好  没问题  深呼吸  深呼吸
All right, okay, breathe, breathe!

427
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,230
滚出去
Get out!

428
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,700
深呼吸  深呼吸  所有事都会变好的
Breathe, breathe, everything is going to be all right!

429
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,600
当女孩烂透了
Being a girl sucks! Yeah.

430
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,310
哈喽
Hello.

431
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,380
那应该是社工来了
That'll be the social worker.

432
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,750
你想要抱抱她吗
Would you like to hold her?

433
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,860
或者我直接抱她下楼呢
Or should I bring her straight downstairs?

434
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:49,820
凯蒂
Katie.

435
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,390
甜美可爱的小凯蒂
Sweet little Katie.

436
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,560
我向你保证  凯蒂
I promise, Katie,

437
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,330
我会当你最棒的妈妈
I'm going to be a good Mommy.

438
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,680
凯蒂
Katie.

439
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,880
凯蒂
Katie. Shh...

440
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,860
都会没问题的
It's gonna be okay.

441
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,630
拜托  凯蒂  都会没问题的
Please. Katie, it's gonna be okay!

442
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:13,070
我的人生完蛋了  爸
My life's over, Dad!

443
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,810
等你当奶奶再说这档事吧
Wait 'til you become a grandparent.

444
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:19,380
凯蒂  凯蒂
Katie, Katie. Shh.

445
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,950
你知道吗  我还记得
You know, I still remember the drive back

446
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,620
你出生后我从医院开回家的时候
from the hospital when you were born.

447
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:35,190
你尖叫兼大哭  整段旅程都是血泪史啊
You screamed blue murder, the whole bloody journey.

448
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,800
我吓到要死  还闯了三次红灯
I was so scared, I jumped three red lights.

449
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,470
失去了我的驾照
Lost my license.

450
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:42,060
你从来没跟我说过这些
You never told me that before.

451
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,770
因为你不是这俱乐部的一员啊
You weren't part of the club.

452
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,080
在这场战斗中  为了保证精神健全
In battle to preserve sanity,

453
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,450
一定要记得  遵守这些守则
must remember following rules.

454
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,820
第一  不在公众场合喂母乳
Number one, never breast feed in a public place.

455
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,430
第二  不让凯蒂喂奶后在膝盖上蹦蹦跳跳
Two, never bounce Katie on knee after feeding.

456
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,400
第三  试着不要哭  当她也在哭的时候
Three, try not to cry when she cries.

457
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,740
第四  最重要的一点
And four, the most important of all,

458
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,700
千万别以为麻烦不会在转角出现
never assume trouble isn't around the next corner.

459
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,070
-晚点见  女孩们  -拜
-Laters, girls. -Bye.

460
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,500
罗茜  糟糕勒
Rosie? Oh, no.

461
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:47,830
整个惨啊  你还好吧
Tragic. Are you okay?

462
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,500
告诉我  这不是你的吧
Tell me that's not yours!

463
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,440
当然不是
No!

464
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,410
怎么  你现在当起保姆了
What, you're a nanny now?

465
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:00,610
你知道的  至少带小孩还蛮好赚的
Yeah! You know, at least it's good money.

466
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,110
我以为你应该在波士顿陪着艾力克斯
Uh, I thought you were going to Boston with Alex.

467
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,680
没有  没有  没有
Oh, no, no, no,

468
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,690
我了解到小孩就是你唯一需要的的教育了
I realized children are the only education you need.

469
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,890
所以  爸爸是谁呢
So, who's the dad?

470
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,190
让她放开  让她放开
Get it off! Get it off!

471
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,560
我必须要走了
I've got to go!

472
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:19,860
那么  再见
Bye, then!

473
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,880
艾力克斯
Alex.

474
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,520
你怎么会在这呢
What are you doing here?

475
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,490
只是回来几周  想要给你一个惊喜
Just back for the weekend. Thought I'd surprise you.

476
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:49,690
太好了  那我们去喝杯咖啡
Great! Uh, yeah. Let's go for a coffee then.

477
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,730
不  不用  在这里就好
Ah! No, no. Let's stay here.

478
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:52,630
不如你给我泡个茶吧
Why don't you put the kettle on?

479
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,240
所以  你最近在忙什么呢
So, what have you been up to?

480
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,140
就这样那样你懂的啦
Oh, just this and that, you know?

481
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,480
顺带一提发型剪的不错
Nice haircut by the way.

482
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,210
谢啦
Yeah, thanks.

483
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,550
你还好吧  你看起来有点压力
You okay? You seem stressed.

484
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,780
没有  没有
No! No!

485
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,950
所以  医学院怎样
Uh, so, how's medicine?

486
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,190
超赞的
Fascinating. Yeah.

487
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,760
事实上  我们才刚在学产科医学而已
We've just been doing obstetrics, in fact.

488
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,120
真的
Really? Mm-hmm.

489
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,130
有太多要学了
So much to learn.

490
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,760
顺带一提  你从哪找到这吸奶器的啊
How do you find these breast pumps, by the way?

491
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,960
有些女人不太喜欢用它们
Some women don't like them.

492
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,030
整个恶梦你都不知道
Oh, total nightmare.

493
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,540
天啊
Oh, God.

494
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,570
你怎么知道的
How did you...

495
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,070
贝瑟尼
Bethany.

496
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,980
真是有效率
Fast work.

497
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,020
我本来要跟你讲的  艾力克斯  真的
I was gonna tell you, Alex, I promise.

498
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,620
什么时候
When?

499
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,220
我不希望把你留在这
I didn't want to hold you back.

500
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,160
她已经腹痛整个月了
She's had colic for months.

501
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:00,770
我整个生活就是  喂她  哄她和打盹儿
My whole life is feeding, winding and nappies.

502
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,940
全部我能想到的就是屎了
All I can think about is poo.

503
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,350
多少  什么时候  什么颜色
How much, when, what color.

504
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,370
我希望你说的是她的
I hope you mean hers.

505
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,660
格雷格知道这件事吗
What happened to Greg?

506
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,330
他听到的那分钟
He miraculously got a job

507
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,850
奇蹟似的获得一份在伊比沙岛上的工作
in Ibiza the minute he heard.

508
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,770
我能当她的教父吗
Can I be godfather?

509
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,010
我想那再好也不过了
I'd love nothing more.

510
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:57,620
你知道吗  我想过不要跟你讲
I think not telling you

511
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,890
因为这样我想梦想就可以继续存在
was a way to keep the dream alive, you know?

512
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,900
这样至少就还有一个人
So there was at least someone out there

513
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,700
仍然可以把我当成原本的罗茜
who still saw me as Rosie.

514
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:14,240
而不是现在变成这么奇怪的我
And not this strange, new person I've become.

515
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,420
最近一次我看起来这么郁闷时
So, the last time I looked that depressed,

516
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,420
我试着戴上我最喜欢的领带时
I tried to hang myself with my favorite tie.

517
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,160
嗨  我是菲尔
Hi, I'm Phil.

518
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,830
艾力克斯
Alex.

519
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,830
我被派去演神仙教母
I've been sent to play fairy godmother.

520
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,900
你看起来不像那个料啊  兄弟
You don't look the part, mate.

521
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,400
我姊妹快把我给逼疯了
My sister's been driving me crazy.

522
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,140
她想知道  你可以请她喝一杯吗
She wants to know, would you buy her a drink?

523
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,740
她是哪一位
Which one is she?

524
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,420
-这正妹是你的同班同学  -莎莉
-The hot girl from class? -Sally.

525
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,020
宛如在窗台上绽放的向日葵一般耀眼
The bright sunflower in the family window box.

526
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,270
每个人都想知道这位可爱的英国男孩
Everybody has been wondering

527
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,780
为什么看起来如此悲伤
why the cute British guy looks so sad.

528
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,460
不好意思
Sorry.

529
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,070
是时候应该让你了解到
It's time to realize

530
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,170
你在这是跟我们在一起的
you're here with us.

531
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,440
而且跟我们在一起你会很开心的
And that we might be fun to be with.

532
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:33,080
凯蒂  这是你第一次的圣诞节
Katie! It's your first Christmas!

533
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:35,480
我希望你有看到我的录影
I hope you got my present!

534
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,120
谢啦  你送她的书还不错  艾力克斯
Thanks for the book, Alex.

535
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,250
我知道的  总有一天她会知道它的好
I know she'll love it one day.

536
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,780
这是什么啊
What is it?

537
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,350
这里是我的新搬来的公寓
This is my new apartment.

538
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,460
你在这做什么啊  亲爱的
What's this you're doing here, darling?

539
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,090
手工爱心
Um, handmade hearts.

540
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,390
然后这里  我有我们最爱的电影  回到未来的海报
And here, we have my favorite Back to the Future poster.

541
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,000
它在浴室里看起来是这么的特别
It would look so special in the bathroom.

542
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,860
走到妈咪这里啊
Walk to Mommy.

543
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:56,100
过来啊宝贝  好女孩
Come to me. Good girl!

544
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,240
凯蒂  亲爱的小家伙  这是你第四次圣诞节啦
Katie, darling, it's your fourth Christmas.

545
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:02,940
你妈妈有没有收到我的圣诞卡片呢
Did, uh, Mommy get my Christmas card?

546
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:10,050
真假啊
Really?

547
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:14,290
她想要告诉你  她可以重复的数数儿到五
She wants me to tell you she can cycle and count to five.

548
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,950
3  4  5
...three, four, five!

549
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,660

而我有了工作  终于不再是全职父母了
Me, I've got a job and finally moved out of Mom and Dad's.

550
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,700
5年后
而我有了工作  终于不再是全职父母了
Me, I've got a job and finally moved out of Mom and Dad's.

551
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,090

而我有了工作  终于不再是全职父母了
Me, I've got a job and finally moved out of Mom and Dad's.

552
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,800
邓恩小姐  欢迎回到旅馆
Miss Dunne! Welcome back to the hotel!

553
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,800
我想您要的是一间豪华套房吗
I believe it's the penthouse suite for you?

554
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,230
没错  感恩啊
That's right, thanks.

555
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,310
妈咪  妈咪
Mommy, Mommy!

556
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,480
今天是上学第一天耶
It's the first day of school!

557
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:24,620
我最近有听到一些关于
I heard some beds

558
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,860
床被偷了的事
were being stolen recently.

559
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,160
这应该没有很奇怪吧
Isn't that strange?

560
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,960
当然啦  妈咪
Yes, Mommy.

561
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,400
这边没有人可以偷到我们的床床
This way, no one can come in and steal ours.

562
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,930
你是我爸爸吗
Are you my daddy?

563
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,540
不是啦  他只是个好人
No! No, he's just a nice man

564
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:41,470
先帮妈咪一个小忙出去一下好吗
that's helping Mommy out a bit, that's all.

565
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,250
该死的  什么
Damn! What?

566
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,380
不是这把钥匙啊
It's the wrong key!

567
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:02,190
-我的头  -小心你的头啊
-My head! -Come on, whinger!

568
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:07,160
那里  那里
Over there! Over there!

569
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,270
拜托  冲啊冲啊
Come on, keep going.

570
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,130
快  快  妈咪
Quick, quick, Mommy!

571
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:10,940
不好意思
Excuse me.

572
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,310
爱你
Love you.

573
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:16,940
我也爱你
Love you, too.

574
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:26,220
你梦调到你是无生命的物体
You dreamt you were an inanimate object?

575
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:29,350
我是说  你想想  一把箭在天上飞来飞去
Yeah, I mean, come on. An arrow flying through the air!

576
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:30,670
那还真是酷弊了
That's pretty cool.

577
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:34,460
我真的不太了  你怎么有办法成为一个东西
I don't understand. How can you be a thing?

578
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:37,360
我也不知道  我的梦一直都像这样啊
I don't know. I've always had dreams like that.

579
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,500
这听起来像是跟自尊有关的问题呢  甜心
It sounds to me like self-esteem issues, sweetie.

580
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,630
你需要跟某人讲讲呢
You may need to talk to someone.

581
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,100
你知道吗  今天又有
You know, there are razor hairs

582
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:49,210
刮胡刀在浴室里
in the bathroom, again today.

583
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:50,510
真的
Really?

584
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:53,280
你知道那会让我有点不舒服的
You know it gives me allergies.

585
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,480
下次你要是也做一个诡异的梦的话
Next time you have one of your weird dreams,

586
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,720
也许可以梦到你像是一个
maybe you should dream

587
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,280
非常厉害的吸尘器
you're something useful like a vacuum cleaner.

588
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,690
我们已经有清洁女工罗
We have a cleaning lady.

589
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:05,420
你到底想要什么
What do you want?

590
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:07,360
为了她去想我们就是一对炮友而已
For her to think we're a pair of fuck-ups?

591
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:09,530
你想的真是精准又正确啊
That's exactly what we are.

592
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,010
你还好吗  有沙子跑进我的眼睛里了哭哭
You okay? I've got sand in my eyes.

593
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:30,080
看着妈咪  修修
Look at Mommy!

594
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:41,010
我梦到我是一个箭头
I dreamt I was an arrow.

595
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:44,010
一支箭上的金属一个箭头
The little metal bit right at the tip of an arrow,

596
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,760
在空气里咻咻咻的飞
whizzing through the air.

597
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,570
那感觉像是什么啊

598
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:58,780
奇怪  感觉很怪

599
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:01,880
别担心  你的梦总是这样子的啊

600
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,740
我好想你罗茜  你可以来找我吗

601
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:13,050
你跟这可怜的家伙讲了啥
What have you told the poor brat?

602
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:16,160
没讲啥啊  他只是寄张票给我  我没有期待什么啦
No! Just that he sent me a ticket. I've got no expectations.

603
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,460
好吧  那很好  他可是有女朋友的人
Well, good, because he's got a girlfriend.

604
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:19,330
虽然你知道的  她的名字
Although you know it's funny, her name

605
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:21,170
从来没有出现过
didn't come up once.

606
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:23,070
好吧  我想凯蒂已经够大可以去知道一些
Yeah, well, Katie's mature enough to know

607
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:24,670
关于那个男人  没关系的
that when it comes to men, it doesn't matter.

608
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:26,100
好吧  我想凯蒂也应该知道
Yeah, well, Katie also knows

609
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:27,410
某些东西触动他
that something must have triggered

610
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:29,210
让他想要看见她妈妈
his sudden enthusiasm to see her mom,

611
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:30,780
要是有谁可以知道他比任何人都好
who, by the way, knows him better than anyone,

612
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,610
那那个人才是发出评语的最佳人选罗
and is clearly the best person to judge!

613
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,440
好了  好了  你好兴奋啊  看到你真好
All right! All right! Good to see you!

614
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:04,080
那累吗  还是饿了
So, tired? Hungry?

615
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,210
不会啊  问这干麻
No. Why?

616
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,630
来跳嘛
Come on.

617
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:27,830
你要再来一杯吗
Do you want another?

618
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,740
好  等我一下  好吗
All right. I'll be back, okay?

619
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,390
所以  你是新来的耶  我是乔纳森
So, you're new here. I'm Jonathan!

620
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,410
罗茜
Rosie!

621
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:43,780
罗茜  所以你是做什么的呢  罗茜
Rosie? So what do you do, Rosie?

622
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:46,520
我是个全职老妈
I'm a mom!

623
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,890
你的意思是那是某种关于表演的东西
Is that some kind of, uh, performance thing?

624
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:50,520
你是一部戏剧的主演
You're a drama major?

625
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:53,890
我是一个妈妈  我有个5岁的女儿
I'm a mother of a 5-year-old girl!

626
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,330
酷  酷
Cool! Cool!

627
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:03,500
我能请你喝一杯或什么的吗
Can I get you a drink or something?

628
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:07,670
一杯杜松子酒跟奎宁水
A gin and tonic.

629
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,710
-手机  汽车钥匙  -兄弟  拜托不要
-Cell? Car keys? -Oh, dude. Come on.

630
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:12,420
大伙儿  大伙儿  大伙儿
Guys, guys, guys,

631
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,180
不要啊  别这样啊  不
no, no, no!

632
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:16,310
别啦  都说不要了  不行啊  你挡不住的啦
Come on, come on! Come on! Please! It's gonna happen!

633
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,680
1  2  3  -好好  我我来了
One, two, three! -Okay, okay!

634
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,820
罗茜  罗茜  救命啊  救
Rosie, Rosie, come on, come...

635
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,230
可以拉我起来吗
Can you give me a hand?

636
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:30,630
没问题的啦
All right.

637
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,770
好耶  有伴了  抱歉  抱歉啦
Come on. Come on! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

638
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,910
你现在看起来真妈的辣爆了  罗茜
You're looking way too hot right now, Rosie.

639
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:50,780
拜托  好吧  好吧  如果你坚持的话那我就不客气啦
Come on, all right, okay. If you want it like that.

640
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,380
不  不  不要
No, no, no!

641
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,490
-你臭臭  -我真的臭臭
-You stink. -I stink?

642
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:01,660
你没有洗澡
You haven't bathed.

643
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:02,760
香蕉笑一个
Bananas?

644
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:05,830
准备好啦  1  2
All right. One, two...

645
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:09,270
-有没有拍到不错的  -没耶  看起来嘛
-Any good? -No, it's sort of...

646
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,310
接住
Catch.

647
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:16,640
好吧来看看
All right.

648
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:22,250
"你会有一个又长又快乐的人生"  不错
"You will live a long and happy life." Sweet.

649
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,250
我可以跟你换吗
Oh, can I switch?

650
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,580
-因为你比较喜欢我的吗  -我就比较喜欢你那一个
-Cause you prefer mine? -I prefer it.

651
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:29,520
我就是  就是那个  好吧其实我跟本不知道我在讲什么
I do, I do. I don't know what I'm talking about.

652
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:32,660
你都带我到这了  我觉得你应该要
Well, you do go here, so you probably

653
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:33,620
知道你要讲什么吧
should know what you're talking about.

654
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,470
虽然这样想很奇怪  但是我竟然可以生活在这
Strange to think that I could have lived here

655
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:43,730
并且成为它的一部份
and been part of it.

656
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,570
但是我并没有后悔生下凯蒂  你知道吗
But I don't regret Katie, you know?

657
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:51,410
我的意思是  我何德何能
I mean, how could I?

658
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:55,610
她总是可以为我带来惊喜
She's the most amazing kid.

659
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,290
最奇怪的是
The weird thing is

660
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,590
她让我想起更多的是你而不是格雷格
that she reminds me more of you than Greg.

661
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:12,530
那可能只是因为我爱她吧
That's probably just 'cause I love her.

662
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,310
我们该走了
We should go.

663
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:37,390
真的很可爱啦
Seriously cute.

664
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:39,590
它是毛绒绒的绒毛球儿
It was a ball of fluff.

665
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:40,890
真的啦
No seriously.

666
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:46,460
莎莉  罗茜
Sally. Rosie.

667
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:47,870
罗茜  莎莉
Rosie, Sally.

668
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:49,830
早安啊
Good morning.

669
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,440
嗨
Hi.

670
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:00,440
这简直可以拿来参展罗
Wow. This should be in a museum.

671
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:02,050
这没什么啦
Oh, it's nothing.

672
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:04,450
只是把鹌鹑蛋和芦笋和
Just quail egg and asparagus

673
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:05,850
芝麻菜酱汁奶泡加在费罗糕点里
in filo pastry with a cream of rocket sauce.

674
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:09,350
我通常就只是烘豆
Well, my regular is baked beans.

675
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:10,350
加番茄酱或咸猪肉烹制的烘豆

676
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,860
好一个英式烘豆
Good old British baked bean.

677
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,090
完全没有营养价值
Zero nutritional value.

678
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,730
但是抹在烤面包上真的不错吃
Yeah. But good on toast.

679
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,860
你知道我不喝酒的
Oh, you know I can't drink.

680
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:21,570
当然啦
Of course.

681
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:23,730
但我们要怎么克服
But how are we going to cope without

682
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:24,740
酒精带来阴霾与麻木呢
the numbing haze of alcohol?

683
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,870
为什么你不能喝啊
Why can't you drink?

684
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:31,120
如果那不是个很失礼的问题的话
If that's not a rude question?

685
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,680
艾力克斯
Alex?

686
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,620
什么
What?

687
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,030
就就  就是那个
Didn't... Didn't...

688
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:52,660
艾力克斯让我怀孕了
Alex and I are pregnant.

689
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,500
12周半大了
Twelve and a half weeks in.

690
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:00,970
那太棒啦
That's wonderful.

691
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,410
恭喜恭喜
Congratulations.

692
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:05,710
恭喜啊
Congratulations.

693
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,150
艾力克斯你怎么没跟我讲呢
Alex, you didn't tell me?

694
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:11,780
不是  我  抱歉  我以为我有讲过了
No, I... Sorry, I thought I did.

695
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,950
就是那个
That's...

696
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,590
让我帮你
Let me help!

697
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:17,760
该死的
Shit! Ah-ah-ah!

698
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,720
爸爸的古董桌子  艾力克斯  快点啊
Daddy's antique table! Alex, quick!

699
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,690
干您娘  你又讲脏话  你就不能注意一下吗
Oh, bollocks. Language, please!

700
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,560
干干  靠  你为什么不能讲一点别的就要讲脏话
Oh, fuck! No! Why can't you just say fudge?

701
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,480
看你让我干了什么好事
Look what you made me do.

702
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:48,990
这没什么  没事啦
It's fine. It's okay.

703
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:52,790
我们一小时后有赫伯的美术展览会预展  我想
We have Herb's vernissage in an hour... It's...

704
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:54,760
所有事情都会变得没问题的
Everything is gonna be fine.

705
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,540
我真的很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

706
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:17,450
莎莉为了这个计划好几周了
Sally had this planned for weeks.

707
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:19,620
这不会很久的  好吗  我保证
It's not for long, okay? I promise.

708
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:22,520
亲爱的  琼斯医生就在糖醋虾球旁边耶
Sweetie? Dr. Jones is by the sweet and sour prawn balls!

709
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,490
-你看他就在那  -亲爱的  现在不是时候  好吗
-Look, he's just... -Sweetie, not now. Okay?

710
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:28,530
但他是一位资深的胸膛外科医生啊  艾力克斯
But he's a senior thoracic surgeon, Alex.

711
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:30,230
她是对的  艾力克斯  快去吧
She's right, Alex. Go on.

712
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:32,760
好啦  走吧  走吧
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

713
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:39,500
这张是我最喜欢的照片之一
This image here is one of my favorites.

714
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:42,470
如何清晰的表达那一闪而逝的瞬间
How to articulate that transient moment

715
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,810
当你经由镜头补抓到到某些东西时
when you see something through the camera's eye.

716
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,180
它就有点像一见钟情
It's a little like love at first sight.

717
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:51,850
就这样停留在你追寻的视线里
Stops you in your tracks.

718
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:55,250
突然之间你了解到它真实的一面
Suddenly you recognize it for exactly what it is.

719
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,950
整整胡说八道
A load of bollocks.

720
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,860
罗茜  罗茜  你要去哪啊
Rosie! Rosie, where are you going?

721
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,930
回家
Back home.

722
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:08,730
回英国去  这些对我来说真是疯了  好吗
And I mean England. This is too crazy for me, okay?

723
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:09,360
我就像直接冲进这一团
I walked straight

724
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,230
我不知道是什么玩意的生活里头
into the middle of something here!

725
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,040
拜托  这真的没什么好吗  说实在的
Look, it's all fine, honestly.

726
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,070
莎莉和我只是需要一点交际和推销我自己
Sally and I just needed to air some stuff!

727
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:16,540
那很好  我很高兴你在那如于得水  但我不是好吗
Oh, good, I'm glad you're fine, 'cause I'm not!

728
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:20,140
我们整晚都没有在一起好吗  艾力克斯
We were out together the whole night, Alex!

729
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:21,390
然后这段一起出游的时间里
And all the while your girlfriend

730
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:22,850
你女朋友在家怀着一个你的小孩
was at home expecting a baby!

731
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:24,950
-然后你却什么也没跟我说  -拜托  罗茜
-And you didn't say! -Come on, Rosie.

732
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:25,920
真的没发生什么事  我们就只是
Nothing happened, we were just...

733
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,820
我们就只是一起做点开心的事而已
We were just having some fun.

734
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:29,630
你就为了这样把我叫过来
That's what you got me over here for then?

735
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:30,790
就为了好玩
Just some fun?

736
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:32,410
我想要见你  老天爷啊
I wanted to see you! For Christ sake,

737
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:34,020
你是我最好的朋友啊
you're my best friend!

738
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:36,450
或者你需要一个从你旧生活圈来的人
Or maybe you needed someone from your old life

739
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:37,660
为你指出这个事实
to point out the truth!

740
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,600
-什么事实  -你整个一团乱啊  艾力克斯
-What truth? Y-ou're in a mess, Alex!

741
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,270
这整个情况就是超级无敌惨烈的一团乱
This whole situation is one big bloody giant mess!

742
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:47,640
我  我现在一团糟
Me? I'm in a mess?

743
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,840
而且你还拒绝去面对它
And you're in denial!

744
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,540
你是在说你自己吧
You're projecting!

745
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:52,840
好吧  我们可以不要在这里研讨这些心理学术语
Okay, can we just stop the psychobabble here

746
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:54,980
然后像个英国人好好的礼貌的讲话吗  好吗
and just talk like English people, please!

747
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:57,920
好啦  好啦  好啦好啦
Fine! Fine! Fine. Fine. Look.

748
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,500
我想你可能觉得有点难为情或困难
I was worried you might find it hard,

749
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,220
你懂的  来这里
you know, coming here.

750
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,250
-困难  -我的意思是  你过得蛮辛苦的不是吗  罗茜
-Hard? -I mean, you've had a tough time, Rosie,

751
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:07,860
然后你看到我们生活的地方  你知道的
and seeing where we live, you know,

752
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:09,790
我们的公寓  我们的生活方式  这些对你来说都
our apartment, our lifestyle, it's just...

753
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,200
天哪  你以为我在忌妒你
Okay! You thought I was jealous of you?

754
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,930
不是这样的
No.

755
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:16,830
我可怜你  艾力克斯
I pity you, Alex!

756
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,800
我只看到某个家伙闲扯他的职涯
All I see is someone compensating for a crap personal life

757
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:21,000
该怎么升该怎样怎样以补偿他的狗屁生活
by schmoozing his way up the career ladder!

758
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:23,310
狗屁生活
Crap personal life?

759
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:24,380
好吧  我们看看
All right, let's see.

760
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,780
稳定的交际关系  跟美丽的女朋友
Um, stable relationship with beautiful girlfriend,

761
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,810
许多共同点  一个非常棒的朋友圈
lots in common, a great circle of friends,

762
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:30,710
即将出世并且有父有母的孩子
a kid on the way, who's gonna have two parents,

763
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,220
顺带一提  不是一个单亲
by the way, not one!

764
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:42,130
罗茜  不是这意思  我
Rosie, come on, I...

765
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,130
想都别想  艾力克斯
Forget it, Alex!

766
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:45,930
去吧去成就你的成就
Go ahead and climb your greasy pole!

767
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,300
你知道吗  我会去做的
You know, I will!

768
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,800
只是当你了解你内在有多空虚时
Just don't come whinging to me

769
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,340
不要回到小惠金区来找我
when you realize you're empty inside.

770
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:53,040
-那里真是超安全的  -那很好
-No danger of that! -Good!

771
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:55,910
-超棒  -棒到你都想不到
-Excellent! -Fantastic!

772
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,780
天啊
Oh, no!

773
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:45,920
见到我开心吗
Pleased to see me?

774
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,390
你在这干麻儿
What are you doing here?

775
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:49,720
你寄给我  凯蒂的画
You sent me Katie's drawing!

776
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,460
我看完后马上搭上第一班回这的飞机了  尽我所能
I got on the first flight I could!

777
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:54,490
天  天  天啊  我不知道我为什么会寄给你  好吗
No! No, no, no! I did that on a whim, okay?

778
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:56,330
凯蒂画了这幅画但它是个误会
Katie drew the picture, and it was a mistake!

779
00:57:56,330 --> 00:57:57,890
我真的没期望你出现
I never expected you to actually show up!

780
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:59,860
那信真的让我省思我的人生
That letter really made me think about my life!

781
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:01,430
我希望可以见见她  罗茜  我是她爸爸啊
I wanna meet her, Rosie! I am her dad.

782
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:03,330
爸爸
Dad?

783
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:06,140
是什么让你觉得
And what precisely is it that you think

784
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:08,140
你有资格当她的爸爸那些花
qualifies you for that title? Those?

785
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:09,630
爸爸  你在哪里
Where were you, Dad?

786
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:10,750
当她因为疝气而一再
when she woke up with colic

787
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:12,310
在半夜醒来哭闹的头几个月
every night for the first few months?

788
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,510
或是她掉的第一颗牙  还是她走的第一步
Or cut her first tooth, or took her first steps?

789
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,570
有人告诉过你吗
Has anyone ever told you,

790
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:19,060
你的眼睛超漂亮的
you have the most amazing eyes?

791
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,360
拜托  我很抱歉好吗  真的
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

792
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:31,460
我知道  我抛弃你离开这  我完全是个卑鄙小人
I get it, I bailed on you. I was a total creep.

793
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,300
但是过去五年里每一天
But there hasn't been a single day in the last five years

794
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,170
我没有一天不去想她长得如何
that I haven't wondered what she's like.

795
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:38,300
她长得像我吗  她在遗传基因上是幸运的吗
Is she like me? Did she luck out on the gene front?

796
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,500
你整个就像是一坨屎
You're so full of shit!

797
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,180
你总得给我一个机会吧  罗茜
You have to give me a chance, Rosie!

798
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,850
我能改变的  我保证
I can be different, I promise.

799
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:52,250
你要我在你面前用手跟膝盖爬也行
Do you want me to crawl on my hands and knees?

800
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:53,820
任何事  罗茜  我求求你
Anything, Rosie! I'm begging you!

801
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:57,190
如果这只是跟我有关  我会马上把你撵回机场让你滚蛋
If this were about me, I'd be driving you to the airport right now!

802
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:58,790
你是对的
You'd be right to.

803
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,960
只给你一次机会
One chance!

804
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:07,000
就此一次机会  假如你搞砸了就给我滚蛋
One chance, but any mess-ups and you're out.

805
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,530
还有态度给我摆正点
And you be nice!

806
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:09,520
态度不只是平常这么好而是要多好就有多好
And I don't just mean average nice,

807
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,050
要像是圣诞老人加复活节兔子和汤姆·汉克这些
I mean Father Christmas-Easter Bunny-Tom Hanks

808
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:13,170
加起来这么好
-all-rolled-into-one nice!

809
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:15,920
-对的  -然后你会给她买
-Yeah. -And you will buy her the most

810
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,870
一双贵到你找都找不到的粉红小鞋
expensive pair of shitty pink shoes that you can find!

811
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,410
我马上上google找  马上
I'm gonna Google them right now.

812
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,310
-击掌  -碰
-Hi-five! -Boo!

813
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:36,910
坐下跟闭嘴

814
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,600
等一下  你做了什么
Wait a minute. You did what?

815
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:18,400
就是这男人  他害得你
This is a man who let you go to casualty on your own

816
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,640
半夜一人孤零零的
in the middle of the night,

817
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,340
陪着一个保险套  坚持你的立场好吗
with a condom stuck up your fanny!

818
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:23,970
他是凯蒂的爸爸
He's Katie's dad.

819
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:24,860
你应该看看当他爸
You should see her little face

820
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:26,180
走进她房间时那发光的小脸
light up when he walks in the room!

821
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:27,940
他们真的有连结
They're really bonding!

822
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:30,570
当然  如果他是个烂货的话
Of course, none of that would matter

823
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:32,620
那这些就都不重要了
if he had a crap bod.

824
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:34,420
他真的有心改过
He's really worked on that thing. Wow.

825
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:35,420
暗指下面那儿也进化了

826
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:36,950
你真的很邪恶  罗茜·邓恩
You're evil, Rosie Dunne.

827
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:42,090
我只是希望有个归属  鲁比
I just want to belong to someone, Ruby.

828
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:43,630
等待让我觉得好累了
I'm tired of waiting.

829
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:46,460
而现在跟他在一起感觉还不错
And it feels good with him.

830
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:49,200
我们就是一家人了
We're a family.

831
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,970
你可以行行好停下来  不要再坐立不安了吗
Can you just stop jumping up and down?

832
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:24,500
我只是想确定每个客人都在这了
I'm just checking everyone's here.

833
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:27,100
每个人  准确的来说还是某个人
Everyone being who, exactly?

834
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:28,140
我们娇滴滴的新娘怎么样啊
How's the blushing bride?

835
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:30,010
像一只疯狂的兔子一样
Like a mad bunny.

836
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:31,570
好的  好的
Okay. Okay.

837
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:34,340
还有这个
Oh.

838
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:38,080
希望这选择不是一个错误的决定  亲爱的
Don't take this the wrong way, love.

839
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:42,940
但是只要你有任何一丝丝的不确定
But if there's any part of you that isn't sure,

840
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:45,120
甚至是现在  告诉我
even now, say the word.

841
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,660
我们会昂首阔步的直接离开这里
We'll walk straight out of here, our heads held high.

842
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,030
所以你喜欢格雷格吗  对吧
So you like Greg, then?

843
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,530
走吧  让我们把你嫁出去吧
Come on. Let's get you hitched.

844
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:11,370
你喜欢这首歌吗
Do you like this?

845
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:12,510
凯蒂  你可以帮个忙吗
Katie, would you please?

846
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:14,180
妈
Mom!

847
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:17,280
不好意思
Sorry.

848
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:37,830
-哈罗  -莎莉
-Hello? -Sally...

849
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,440
罗茜
Rosie.

850
01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:42,170
我可以为你做些什么
What can I do for you?

851
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:44,210
艾力克斯在吗
Um, is Alex there?

852
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:46,340
他没有跟你讲吗
Did he not tell you?

853
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:47,640
跟我讲什么
Tell me what?

854
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:49,180
艾力克斯跟我分手了
Alex and I separated.

855
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:50,510
什么  哪时的事啊
What? When?

856
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,550
大概2个月前吧
About eight weeks ago?

857
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:54,450
大概就是你结婚的那天
Pretty much the day of your wedding.

858
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:00,690
天哪
Oh, God!

859
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:01,860
什么
What?

860
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:04,390
什么
What?

861
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,760
我觉得我羊水破了
I think my water just broke!

862
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,530
天啊
Oh, God!

863
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:08,320
等等  等等  你确定
Wait, wait. Are you sure?

864
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,530
说不定你只是不小心把自己弄湿了
Maybe you just wet yourself.

865
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:11,670
不是  我没有弄湿我自己  赫伯在哪
No, I did not wet myself! Where is Herb?

866
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:13,270
赫伯  天啊
Herb? Oh, God.

867
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:14,740
-那谁  不会是那艺术家吧  -赫伯
-Who, the artist? -Herb!

868
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,710
我要生了  小朋友要出来了啊
It's happening! The baby!

869
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:23,720
小朋友真的快出来了  赫伯
It's coming! Herb!

870
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:38,000
艾力克斯  如果我知道的话

871
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:44,000
顺带一提  赫伯

872
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:50,460
莎莉跟他有一腿  結果他才是小孩的爸爸

873
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:54,210
艾力克斯

874
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:10,350
还好啦  反正我也沒有真的准备好要当爸爸

875
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:38,180
5年后

876
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:44,130
凯蒂
Katie!

877
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,600
妈  你应该要敲门的啊
Mom! You're supposed to knock!

878
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,500
那音乐  它太吵了一点吧
The music! It's too loud!

879
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,270
听不清楚你讲什么啊  那音乐太吵了啊
Can't hear you! The music's too loud!

880
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,240
-不要关小声  -这音乐需要你好好的去感受它
-Don't do that! -Yeah, this music needs to be felt.

881
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:01,710
你是不是擦了口红
Is that lipstick you're wearing?

882
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:03,580
隐私权  妈  拜托
Privacy, Mom! Please!

883
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:06,650
好的
Okay!

884
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:10,290
现在有没有带  我给你们的保暖内衣啊
Now, have you got the thermal underwear I gave you?

885
01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:11,850
那可是地中海啊
It's the Mediterranean.

886
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:13,010
那现金呢
Um, what about cash?

887
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:15,290
如果你们需要的话  我这里还有一些额外的
I've got some extra if you like.

888
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:17,260
手机充电器  皮包  爸
Phone chargers? Your wallet, Dad?

889
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:17,830
罗茜  没问题的啦
Rosie, it's fine.

890
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:19,630
不要像你妈一样大惊小怪唠唠叨叨的
Will you stop fussing like a mother hen?

891
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:21,460
好啦
Yes.

892
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:22,370
再见  爱你

01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:26,300
再见
Bye.

896
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:30,740
所以我的父母卖了房子
So my parents have sold up

897
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:31,570
跑去当背包客爽爽旅游去了
and gone backpacking,

898
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:35,450
我却得留在家因为口红  跟一个12岁女孩唠叨
nagging a 12-year-old about lipstick.

899
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:36,910
说真的认真  你能不能找到更进一步的证据
I mean, seriously, could you find further proof

900
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,680
去证明我的人生有多么的干
of how fucked up my life is?

901
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:43,920
贝瑟尼

But you! Your success, it's, uh... It's amazing!

907
01:06:55,670 --> 01:06:57,630
我刚从摩洛哥飞过来呢
I've just flown from Morocco,

908
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:58,970
明天我又要飞走了

心在淌血啊
The heart bleeds.

911
01:07:03,510 --> 01:07:05,610
波士顿  你应该去看看艾力克斯

912
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:07,340
认真

01:07:07,350 --> 01:07:10,050
艾力克斯·斯图尔特  你们还有在联络
Alex Stewart? You guys still keep in touch?

914
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:13,350
当然  他还是非常的友善啊
Of course. He could do with a friendly face.

915
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:14,620
太好啦  那我等等来跟你打探一下他最近如何吧
Great! I'll get his details from you later!

916
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:17,820

Could I have some Evian sent up to my room?

918
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:21,720
我只能喝这种矿泉水

好的
Of course.

921
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:32,540
这就是你关于你人生要多干有多干的证据啦
That's how fucked-up your life is.

922
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,980
妈
Mom!

923
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:46,940

你有找到不错的餐厅吗
Have you found some good places to eat?

925
01:07:54,330 --> 01:07:55,560

妈到底怎么回事
Mom, what is it?

929
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:10,010
我有坏消息要跟你讲
It's bad news for you.

930
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:12,480
妈
Mom?

931
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:15,450
妈到底是怎么了
Mom, what is it?

932
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:17,510
你来了
Really?

933
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:30,790
当我听到  这些年我一直混混噩噩  我
When I heard, the years fell away, I was...

934
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:33,890
我又变成机窝囊废了
I was a fucked-up kid all over again.

935
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:39,030
你老爸就像英雄一样值得人去崇拜
Hero worshipping this amazing dad you had.

936
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:55,780
不好意思
Sorry.

937
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:03,790
我竟然没能跟他讲再见
I never got to say goodbye.

938
01:10:04,990 --> 01:10:06,490
乖乖抱一个  抱一个不哭不哭乖乖
Hey, come here. Come here, you.

939
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:18,170
把你的手从老子的女人身上放开
Hey, hey! Hands off my woman!

940
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:24,720
我刚刚跟你表妹聊天
I've just been chatting to your cousin.

941
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,080
她真的是挺讨人厌的
She is such a bore.

942
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:31,080
你认真  你有生气吗
Seriously? Are you pissed?

943
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,820
这葬礼的场地真的挺难找的啊  艾力克斯
I find funerals really difficult, Alex.

944
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:38,410
因为罗茜我想说的是
Ah, cause Rosie, I mean,

945
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:39,520
现在对罗茜来说是很困难又难过的时期不是吗
she's having a great time.

946
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,660
你知道吗  吃屎去吧你
You know what? Fuck you!

947
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:41,760
不要这样拜托
Please?

948
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:45,220
感谢你的来访
Thanks for turning up.

953
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:12,050

someone who'll always be there for you,

954
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:13,620
并且爱着你的每一分每一寸
and who'll love every part of you...

955
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:41,820
妈  不穿那件灰色的牛仔裤我就不出门
Mom! I'm not going without my grey skinny jeans!

956
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:43,290
好好好  等会拿来给你
All right! I'll get them for you!

957
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:03,910
"罗茜  你值得让一个更"
"Rosie, you deserve someone who..."

958
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:05,640
有我的信吗
Anything for me?

959
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:07,880
有  只有这封
Uh, yeah, just this one.

960
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:16,720
从法国寄来的  在我爸死的前一天寄的
In France, the day before he died.

961
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:18,220
-天啊  不要读它  -你说什么
-Oh, God, don't read that. -What?

962
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:20,290
因为它会让你难过的
Well, it'll upset you.

963
01:12:22,230 --> 01:12:23,660
我宁愿难过
I'm already upset.

964
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:25,760
好吧
Right.

965
01:12:28,670 --> 01:12:30,170
你希望我留下来陪你吗
Do you want me to stay?

966
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,670
够好笑的了  不用
Funnily enough, no.

967
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,370
好吧  假如你需要我就打电话给我  好吗
Okay. Well, call me if you need anything, okay?

968
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:53,620
亲爱的  罗茜  我真是难以相信
Dear Rosie, I can't believe it.

969
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:59,230
我终于在这了  终于漫步在这地中海的沿岸
Here I am at last, finally walking the Mediterranean coast.

970
01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:05,000
我已经失去了许多年  都是为了等待这一刻
I've lost count of the years I've waited for this moment.

971
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,680
不知怎么的生活就是有他们的方式该去走该去前进
Somehow life got in the way.

972
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,400
而他们都是不错的
And it was all good,

973
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,770
这每一分每一秒对我来说都是没有任何后悔
I don't regret a minute of it,

974
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:12,880
但是在我们的冒险中我们忘记了我们的梦想
but we forget our dreams at our peril.

975
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:16,050
我知道你也有你的梦想
I know you had yours, too,

976
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:19,750
但有时梦想的远去是为了某些更美好的事物
and it must feel sometimes like they're gone for good.

977
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:22,320
但是我对于你成为一个女人是这么的骄傲  罗茜
But I'm so proud of the woman you've become, Rosie,

978
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:25,420
对于凯蒂你也是值得骄傲的妈妈
of the mother you've been to Katie.

979
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,940
我曾对你说关于你的都是真的
What I once said about you is still true,

980
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:31,340
没有什么可以挡住你
there's nothing you can't do

981
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:32,790
如果你用心去做的话
if you put your mind to it.

982
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,520
继续追逐你的梦想好吗
So keep chasing those dreams,

983
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:36,830
你会吧  亲爱的
will you, darling?

984
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:40,040
至少为了我去追逐你的梦想吧  爸爸字
For my sake, Dad.

985
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:55,790
为什么那些人可以  就这样就永远不在了呢
How can someone just not be there anymore?

986
01:14:00,190 --> 01:14:01,120
去他妈的谁知道
Fuck knows.

987
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:09,070
至少他做了他想做的事
At least he did everything he wanted.

988
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:11,700
他没有忘记他的梦想
He didn't forget his dreams.

989
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:18,940
如果我跟你讲
What if I told you

990
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,380
我要用一笔钱
I was gonna use my share

991
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:25,820
是之前卖屋子分到的呢
of the money from the house

992
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:27,420
然后帮我自己建一座旅馆呢
and get myself a hotel?

993
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:30,150
可能有点简陋
Somewhere simple but...

994
01:14:31,290 --> 01:14:32,860
但是是属于我的旅馆
But my own place.

995
01:14:34,490 --> 01:14:36,430
我想那会是非常棒的主意  妈
I think that would be awesome, Mom.

996
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:47,470
罗茜  我了解你可能不能跟我联络
Rosie, I understand that you haven't been in touch.

997
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:50,770
但我只需要知道  一件事
And I just need to know one thing.

998
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:54,510
你跟他在一起开心吗
Are you happy with him?

999
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:02,820
在我人生中没有做到很多对的决定  但是这个家
There's not much I got right in my life, but this family,

1000
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:05,860
虽然不尽全然完美但它是个家
somehow we're making it work.

1001
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:07,230
所以我想如果用一个字来回答的话
So I guess the one word answer to your question

1002
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:08,160
我想应该是
should be,

1003
01:15:09,190 --> 01:15:10,360
是的
"Yes."

1004
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:20,840
-嗨  -嗨
-Hey! -Hi.

1005
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:23,140
看看这一个  香洲花园酒店
So look at this. The Sweetlands Hotel.

1006
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:24,340
那是我们办毕业舞会的地方耶
That's where we had our end of school dance!

1007
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:26,310
他们刚加入我们的连锁店
Ah. They just joined our group.

1008
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:28,240
然后我本来在查折扣相关资讯
And I was just checking for discounts,

1009
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:30,050
然后我发现这个预约
and I found this booking...

1010
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:33,350
那是格雷格的名字耶
That's Greg's name!

1011
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:36,290
新婚套房  这个周末
The bridal suite, for this weekend!

1012
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:38,890
他会去那里出差
He's already up there on business.

1013
01:15:38,890 --> 01:15:41,290
你是想  他是要订来庆祝我们的结婚周年纪念日吧
Do you think... For our anniversary?

1014
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,800
是格雷格
It's him. Mmm.

1015
01:15:51,570 --> 01:15:56,440
那个  我必须要在这里多待几个晚上
Uh, listen, I'm gonna have to stay here a few extra nights,

1016
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,970
他们需要留下来我多看几个场地
the guys need me to check out some more venues.

1017
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:01,080
你能带着凯蒂去看看你妈
Um, can you take Katie and go to your mom's,

1018
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,910
然后我回去大概是星期日  再顺道带你回去
and then I can swing by on Sunday and pick you up?

1019
01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:05,850
宝贝
Babe?

1020
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:08,280
好
Fine.

1021
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:10,450
好勒  晚点见  拜
Cool, see you later, then.

1022
01:16:11,490 --> 01:16:12,920
晚点说  拜
Talk later. Bye.

1023
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:18,560
查看预约情况
Check the booking.

1024
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:25,370
在这  新婚套房
Here it is. Bridal suite for two,

1025
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:27,170
两个人住进去两小时前
checked in two hours ago...

1026
01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:30,840
罗茜  我不知道
Oh, Rosie, I'm...

1027
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:53,100
罗茜  罗茜  你打算要说什么啊
Rosie! Rosie? What are you going to say?

1028
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:03,640
操被抓包
Fuck!

1029
01:18:08,170 --> 01:18:10,610
"罗茜
"Rosie,

1030
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:14,110
你值得一个全心全意爱你的人
you deserve someone who loves you with every beat of his heart.

1031
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:16,680
不论刮风下雨永远陪伴在你身边
Someone who will always be there for you,

1032
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:19,980
爱着你的全部每一分每一寸  甚至是你的缺点也一样
and who will love every part of you, especially your flaws.

1033
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:22,950
我知道凯蒂需要她爸爸  我并不不想介入
I know Katie needs her dad. I don't want to intrude.

1034
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:25,520
如果这封信对你来说是个错误  那就当它从来不存在
So if this is all wrong, just ignore it

1035
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:26,590
而且我也永远不会再提起这件事
and I promise I'll never broach the subject again.

1036
01:18:28,390 --> 01:18:30,330
格雷格真的不是适合你的那个男人  罗茜
Greg's not the man for you, Rosie.

1037
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:34,000
我已经让你从我的手中错过两次
Twice I've let you slip through my fingers.

1038
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,470
让我们不要害怕面对这个机会吧
Let's stop being afraid and take the chance.

1039
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:39,000
我知道怎么样才能让你开心
I know now I can make you happy.

1040
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,040
打电话给我如果你也这么觉得的话
Call me if you feel the same way.

1041
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,340
爱你  艾力克斯"
Love, Alex."

1042
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:01,390
艾力克斯  在吗

1043
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:13,880
可以聊聊吗

1044
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:15,200
我不认为你会想和我聊

1045
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,220
拜托  艾力克斯  你有些奇怪

1046
01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:29,150
贝瑟尼
Bethany?

1047
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:31,720
你在那里干麻
What are you doing there?

1048
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:33,360
我住在这里啊  我搬进来了
I live here now. I moved in.

1049
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,790
来看看这是谁啊  Schnuffs先生
Look who it is, Mr. Schnuffs!

1050
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:38,060
Schnuffs先生
Mr. Schnuffs?

1051
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:39,800
罗茜
Rosie?

1052
01:19:50,310 --> 01:19:52,370
宝贝  我们讲那个是不是太早啦
Hey... Baby, that thing we were talking about earlier.

1053
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:54,140
现在问她
Ask her now.

1054
01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:55,710
Schnuffie
Schnuffie...

1055
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:02,420
贝瑟尼跟我
Bethany and me,

1056
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:05,750
我们想为什么还要寻寻觅觅  你懂的
Uh, we thought, why hang around, you know,

1057
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,460
所以  她开始计划整个事情
um, so, she started organizing the whole thing,

1058
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:12,260
但是菲尔说不  而这时你出现了  很明显的
but then Phil said no, so your name came up, obviously.

1059
01:20:14,330 --> 01:20:15,700
我们要结婚了
We're getting married!

1060
01:20:17,170 --> 01:20:21,670
这真的发生的很快  因为我们必需在纽约时装周前搞定
It's fast, but we need to fit it in before New York Fashion Week.

1061
01:20:21,670 --> 01:20:24,410
你一定要来当我们的伴娘
And you have to be our best man!

1062
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:26,810
我是说  你还是个女孩  对吧
I mean, you are a girl but... Right?

1063
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:29,580
这都是你促成的  罗茜  都是因为你告诉我他在这里
This is all because of you, Rosie. You told me to come here.

1064
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:31,680
如果不是你这一切都不会发生  感谢你
It wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you! Thank you!

1065
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:39,350
能有你当朋友真是太棒了
It is so great having you as a friend.

1066
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,660
每次有烂事在我人生中发生
I mean, every time something goes wrong in my life,

1067
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:42,160
我只要想到你就备感安慰
all I got to do is look at yours

1068
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:43,460
而且这可以让我把看所有事的眼光放到更远的未来
and it puts everything into perspective.

1069
01:20:44,730 --> 01:20:47,260
他在一艄船上向她求婚
He proposed to her on a boat.

1070
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:50,670
它看起来就像里奥那多跟凯特  站在甲板上那幕
It's like Kate and Leonardo in that scene on the deck.

1071
01:20:50,670 --> 01:20:52,230
铁达尼号
TheTitanic. Mm-hmm.

1072
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:54,740
多速配啊
How appropriate.

1073
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:57,210
艾力克斯他一直都是你的好吗
Look, Alex is yours, he always has been.

1074
01:20:57,210 --> 01:20:58,870
这只是证明了所有权罢了
This is just proof of ownership.

1075
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,510
他写这封信是一个月前了
He wrote that months ago!

1076
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:04,310
-而且不管怎样说他是我最好的朋友  -才不是
-And anyway he's my best friend! -No!

1077
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:07,620
我才是你最好的朋友  了解没
I'm your best friend! Get it yet?

1078
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:10,350
我们只是一直想念对方
We just keep missing each other.

1079
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:14,560
也许我们两个命中不注定
Maybe we're just not meant to be.

1080
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,790
天啊  让我试着解释这个给你听
Right. Let me just try and explain this

1081
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:18,230
用你听得懂得话
in a language you might understand.

1082
01:21:19,330 --> 01:21:20,900
船  冰山
Ship. Iceberg.

1083
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:22,870
船撞到冰山
Ship hits iceberg.

1084
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:26,740
混乱  震惊  一片冰冷的海洋
Mayhem, horror, ocean of ice

1085
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:29,640
然后艾力克斯在这最后一艄救生艇上
and then Alex on the last lifeboat.

1086
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,240
剩最后一个位置  坐在上面的是贝瑟尼吗
One space left. Is it Bethany?

1087
01:21:32,710 --> 01:21:34,140
还是罗茜呢
Or Rosie?

1088
01:21:35,810 --> 01:21:37,150
谁将会坐上去呢
Who's it going to be?

1089
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:42,920
什么  你现在是要移民吗你
What? You're immigrating now?

1090
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:44,790
没时间了  很多东西  你要付超重的钱
Less time, more outfits. You're paying excess.

1091
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:50,190
我不能让她留下啊啊  凯蒂要去的话  托比也要去啊
I couldn't leave her behind and wherever Katie goes, Toby goes.

1092
01:21:50,190 --> 01:21:52,460
你们两个是连体婴了是吧
Oh, are you two an item now?

1093
01:21:52,460 --> 01:21:53,900
没这回事  我们只是朋友  没这回事  我们只是朋友
No way. We're friends. No way. We're friends.

1094
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:55,600
上帝保佑我
God give me strength.

1095
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:56,800
-好吧  我们真的快迟到了  -放松
-Well, come on, we're really late. -Relax.

1096
01:21:57,470 --> 01:21:59,470
我讨厌提早到
I hate arriving early,

1097
01:21:59,470 --> 01:22:00,260
除此之外  我们还要
and besides, we have

1098
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:01,200
在飞机上坐5  6个小时
a five or six hour cushion on the other side.

1099
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:11,310
-抱歉  现在是怎样  -火山灰
-Um, sorry, what's going on? -Volcanic ash.

1100
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:12,610
我需要到波士顿去啊
I need to go to Boston!

1101
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:15,220
我恐怕要告诉你可能航班要晚5  6个小时
I'm afraid it's a five to six hour delay.

1102
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:17,390
我想你的航班是飞不成咧
I think your cushion just burst.

1103
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,460
慢点啊  我没有穿运动内衣啊
Slow down! I'm not wearing a sports bra!

1104
01:22:29,470 --> 01:22:31,570
好吧  你们去带着你们的行李
Okay, you guys, get your stuff!

1105
01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:32,830
凯蒂  带上行李
Katie move it!

1106
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,340
来啦  来啦
I'm coming, I'm coming!

1107
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:35,470
鲁比  快啊
Ruby, come on!

1108
01:22:35,470 --> 01:22:36,540
妈
Mom!

1109
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:42,440
你这趟旅程真是多灾多难
And you thought the flight was rough.

1110
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:45,710
我们要在车里换衣服了  我们迟到很多了
You'll have to get dressed in the van! We are so late!

1111
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:53,260
不好意思
Excuse me?

1112
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:54,360
这一切真的太乱七八糟了
You get everything the wrong way round over here.

1113
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,960
-你是  -鲁比
-And you are? -Ruby.

1114
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:56,990
见到你是我的荣幸  鲁比
A pleasure to meet you, Ruby.

1115
01:22:56,990 --> 01:22:58,290
同感
Likewise.

1116
01:22:58,300 --> 01:22:59,430
嫁给我好吗
Will you marry me?

1117
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:04,270
什么  这太扯了  这不公平啊
What? That's not... That's not fair!

1118
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:05,570
这不是  这不是这么容易的好吗  这是非常
That's not... It can't be that easy, it's not...

1119
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:19,820
我想她想让所有在她身旁的女人  都看起来比她肥
I think she wants all the women around her to look fat.

1120
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:21,450
好吧  它很有效
Well, it works.

1121
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:38,400
不  不  你不知道这有多辛苦
No, no, you don't know how hard it is.

1122
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,590
最后一个警告
Final word of warning.

1123
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:05,660
艾力克斯的酒量  几乎跟可以致命的量差不多
Alex can hold his drink to an almost lethal degree,

1124
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:07,660
因为当我在18岁生日时
as I discovered on my 18th birthday,

1125
01:24:07,670 --> 01:24:10,700
他决定整晚只喝龙舌兰
when he decided a night of tequila slammers was the way to go.

1126
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,400
那你知道吗  当人们可以醉到
Well, you know when people say that they were so drunk,

1127
01:24:15,410 --> 01:24:16,640
整晚的记忆都可以是一片空白时
that the whole night is a blank

1128
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:19,470
但是你还是说着  "想都别想  俺是酒国至尊"
and you always go, "No way, not possible."

1129
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:22,480
好吧  相信我  那是在吹牛
Well, believe me, it's possible.

1130
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:35,420
选择一个
Choosing a...

1131
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:39,530
选择一个可以与你共渡一生的人
Choosing the person that you want to share your life with

1132
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:45,800
对我们每一个人来说  都是最最重要的决定
is one of the most important decisions any of us makes,

1133
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,400
没有之一
ever.

1134
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:52,070
因为当你决定错了
Because when it's wrong,

1135
01:24:52,910 --> 01:24:54,510
你的人生就会从彩色变成黑白的
it turns your life to grey.

1136
01:24:55,350 --> 01:24:57,380
而且有时候
And sometimes...

1137
01:24:57,380 --> 01:25:00,420
甚至于  你根本没有注意到这件事
Sometimes you don't even notice

1138
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:01,580
直到你某天早上醒来
until you wake up one morning

1139
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:04,120
然后发现  但是许多年已经过去了
and realize years have gone by.

1140
01:25:06,490 --> 01:25:07,860
我想我们俩都很了解这点  艾力克斯
We both know about that one, Alex.

1141
01:25:11,390 --> 01:25:15,360
你的友谊为我的人生  带来绚烂而华丽的色彩
Your friendship has brought glorious Technicolor to my life.

1142
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,730
就算在我人生的低谷中依然存在
It's been there even in the darkest of times.

1143
01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:22,400
而我很幸运的因为  拥有这份礼物才得以存活至今
And I am the luckiest person alive for that gift.

1144
01:25:25,710 --> 01:25:27,440
我希望我并没有将它视为理所当然
I hope I didn't take it for granted.

1145
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:29,880
但我就是这么做了
I think maybe I did.

1146
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:33,450
因为有时候  你会没办法看到
Because sometimes you don't see

1147
01:25:33,450 --> 01:25:35,620
最美好的事其实  就发生在你身上而已
that the best thing that's ever happened to you

1148
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:37,890
它就在那就在你的鼻子下方
is sitting there, right under your nose.

1149
01:25:40,090 --> 01:25:41,660
但是那也没关系了
But that's fine, too.

1150
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:44,160
真的
It really is.

1151
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:47,060
因为我了解到
Because I've realized that

1152
01:25:49,570 --> 01:25:51,030
不管你在哪
no matter where you are

1153
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,470
你在做什么  或跟谁在一起
or what you're doing, or who you're with,

1154
01:25:58,010 --> 01:25:59,510
我会一直一直
I will always

1155
01:26:01,110 --> 01:26:03,810
诚实的  真诚的
honestly, truly,

1156
01:26:05,050 --> 01:26:07,580
完全爱着你
completely love you.

1157
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:28,170
像姊妹关爱着兄弟一样
Like a sister loves a brother

1158
01:26:29,710 --> 01:26:31,440
又像朋友关爱朋友一样
and a friend loves a friend.

1159
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:36,550
我将会在这永远悍卫我们的梦想  艾力克斯
I'll always stand guard over your dreams, Alex.

1160
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:40,920
不管它是有多奇怪多诡异
No matter how weird or twisted they get.

1161
01:26:46,690 --> 01:26:48,820
所以请各位
So, please, everybody,

1162
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,860
请跟我一起举杯
join me in a toast.

1163
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:54,230
敬我们的新郎与新娘
To the bride and groom.

1164
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:57,130
敬新郎与新娘
To the bride and groom!

1165
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:09,780
来嘛  让我看看你的舞步
Come on, show me what you've got!

1166
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:11,010
不  拜托  那就来吧
No, please! Well, okay then!

1167
01:27:11,010 --> 01:27:12,550
准备好没
Ready?

1168
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:14,180
上吧  你喜欢吗
Here we go. You like it?

1169
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,790
宝贝  宝贝  怎么了
Baby, baby, what's up?

1170
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:04,200
凯蒂
Katie?

1171
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:08,800
凯蒂她  她刚刚就这样跑过去了
Katie just... She just went through here!

1172
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:10,770
凯蒂
Katie?

1173
01:28:11,770 --> 01:28:12,910
妈
Mom?

1174
01:28:14,980 --> 01:28:16,680
你在这干嘛啊
What are you doing out here?

1175
01:28:22,620 --> 01:28:24,190
托比亲我  妈
Toby kissed me, Mom.

1176
01:28:26,690 --> 01:28:28,290
你觉得这样不好吗
Is that such a bad thing?

1177
01:28:29,230 --> 01:28:30,130
当然啦
Of course it is.

1178
01:28:32,230 --> 01:28:34,930
听着  我
Hey. Look, I...

1179
01:28:34,930 --> 01:28:37,130
我今晚看你们两个  你们在一起互动的还不错啊
I was watching you two tonight. You're good together.

1180
01:28:38,070 --> 01:28:40,000
你们是一国的好吗
You're a team.

1181
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,040
你还不懂吗
Don't you get it?

1182
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:44,240
那就会像你们两个亲亲或是那个
It would be like you two kissing or something.

1183
01:28:45,580 --> 01:28:47,110
我会叫他把这些都忘了
I'll just tell him to forget the whole thing.

1184
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,280
凯蒂  那个
Katie that...

1185
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:55,250
你就犯了一个大错了
That would be a big mistake.

1186
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:57,350
听着  如果你现在拒绝他
Look, if you reject him now,

1187
01:28:57,350 --> 01:29:00,160
他就要花一辈子的时间
he's gonna make it his life's mission to go out there

1188
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,260
在整个世界上寻找  这世界最完美最正的女孩
and meet the most perfect, beautiful girl in the world

1189
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:03,660
试到头来  他会发现那就是你
just to try and get over you.

1190
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:09,160
然后他将会娶这位最美的女孩
And he'll end up marrying this other woman

1191
01:29:09,170 --> 01:29:12,230
并且他与她将会共渡剩下的人生
and spending the rest of his life with her.

1192
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:14,700
然后你知道的  他会告诉他自己她到底有多完美
And you know, he'll tell himself that she's perfect and...

1193
01:29:17,870 --> 01:29:19,910
他真的应该庆幸
He really must be happy,

1194
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:24,610
但那要是不是你的话  你知道的
but she won't be you, you know?

1195
01:29:26,150 --> 01:29:27,920
但是你们两个没有真的亲亲过吧
But you two never actually kissed?

1196
01:29:29,090 --> 01:29:30,250
-有吗  -当然没有
-Did you? -Of course not.

1197
01:29:35,390 --> 01:29:37,030
凯蒂
Katie?

1198
01:29:37,030 --> 01:29:39,330
托比
Toby!

1199
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:42,160
我真的很抱歉  不如就让我们假装它从来没有发
I'm really sorry. Let's just pretend it never happened...

1200
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:52,010
艾力克斯
Alex?

1201
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:03,180
我真的了解到  今晚你忘了说
I only realized, uh, tonight that you forgot.

1202
01:30:06,890 --> 01:30:09,060
在你18岁生日那天
Your 18th birthday,

1203
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:12,230
我想大约喝了5杯龙舌兰后
about five tequila slammers in, I think,

1204
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:18,000
在你摔下凳子前
before you fell off the stool...

1205
01:30:22,910 --> 01:30:25,140
所以那就是为什么你带着  贝瑟尼去跳舞
So that's why you took Bethany to the dance.

1206
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:32,450
然后你跟格雷格一起参加舞会
And you went with Greg.

1207
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:41,720
拜
Well, bye.

1208
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:43,220
好的
Okay.

1209
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:42,420
干杯
Cheers!

1210
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:49,520
这真是太棒了
It's so nice.

1211
01:31:50,990 --> 01:31:52,930
你拥有自己的旅馆了  亲爱的
Your own hotel, darling.

1212
01:31:52,930 --> 01:31:54,330
你老爹会以你为荣的
Your father would be so proud of you.

1213
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:12,150
宝贝  宝贝  我们有客人来
Babe! Babe! We've got a visitor!

1214
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:24,030
你们还有房间吗
Do you have a room?

1215
01:32:25,390 --> 01:32:27,160
是的  当然有啦
Yes, of course.

1216
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:28,930
单人  住一晚
A single, for one night.

1217
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,270
欢迎  你是我们第一位客人
Welcome! You are our first guest.

1218
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:47,820
我们之前见过吗
Have we met before?

1219
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:53,350
保险套掉下来卡在我阴道里
The condom came off inside my vagina

1220
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,020
然后现在我不知道它在哪啊
and at present I'm unable to locate it!

1221
01:32:59,130 --> 01:33:01,430
我想应该没有吧
I don't think so.

1222
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:03,600
鲁比  你能带我们的客人到他的房间去吗
Ruby, would you please see our guest upstairs to his room?

1223
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,200
没问题
Of course.

1224
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:06,070
香槟免费
And free champagne!

1225
01:33:07,070 --> 01:33:08,500
好啦  请跟我走
All right, follow me and then...

1226
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:13,580
全新的床  还有啊
Yeah, a brand new bed, and...

1227
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:15,480
还有壮阔的海景
It's massive and you get to see the sea.

1228
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:17,110
该怎么说呢  风景真的超正点的
And it's... It's really pretty.

1229
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:18,280
你会爱上它的  你会爱上它的
You'll love it. You'll love it.

1230
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:50,510
嗨
Hi.

1231
01:33:51,910 --> 01:33:53,050
嗨
Hi...

1232
01:34:04,490 --> 01:34:06,530
小朋友们
Hey, guys!

1233
01:34:06,530 --> 01:34:08,160
-不要啦  我想要看他  -出去  快  出去
-No, I want to see him! -Come on, out. No, out.

1234
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:09,400
我说出去  出去  去  去  去
I said out! Come on, out, out, out!

1235
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:10,630
不  可是  我想
No, but I...

1236
01:34:17,010 --> 01:34:18,610
所以  我想
So, I, uh...

1237
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:20,210
我想我需要一间房
I guess I need a room.

1238
01:34:21,310 --> 01:34:22,580
有行李吗
Any baggage?

1239
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:25,580
没有耶
No.

1240
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:28,120
我抛开一切了
I left it behind.

1241
01:34:29,690 --> 01:34:30,620
那你老婆
So your wife...

1242
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:33,320
没有带来
Won't be joining me.

1243
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:38,460
我们都知道那样是不对的
We both knew it wasn't right.

1244
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,300
无敌海景还是一般风景
Sea view or garden view?

1245
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:46,530
我  推荐无敌海景
I... recommend the sea.

1246
01:34:50,170 --> 01:34:51,410
那就来个海景吧
Um, sea it is.

1247
01:34:54,210 --> 01:34:56,480
一间海景房
One room with sea view.

1248
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:00,580
鲁比  你可以带我们的客人  上楼看看无敌海景房吗
Um, Ruby would you mind showing our guest upstairs

1249
01:35:03,990 --> 01:35:06,720
抱歉老大  我现在忙着这个又忙那个太忙了
Sorry, chief, but I'm really busy doing the files right now.

1250
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:12,690
那麻烦你  跟着我来
Um, please, follow me.

1251
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:23,300
所以  我在飞机上作了一个很奇怪的梦
So, I had this weird dream on the plane over...

1252
01:35:23,310 --> 01:35:25,310
让我猜一猜  你是一个安全带夹
Let me guess, you were a clip on the seatbelts?

1253
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:26,570
不是  没关系我知道了
No, I know,

1254
01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:29,180
你是  你是一个阀门上面有很吵的风扇
you were, um, a valve in those annoying fans

1255
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:30,480
它总是朝着你吹着冷风  我永远也关不掉它们
that blow cold air on you? I can never turn those things off.

1256
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:37,290
不是
No.

1257
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:41,490
这也不是
No, uh...

1258
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:46,490
我就是我
I was me.

1259
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:50,570
而你就是你
And you were you,

1260
01:35:53,100 --> 01:35:55,400
现在站在这的你  就是最完美的你
standing where you are right now, perfect.

1261
01:36:00,180 --> 01:36:03,710
然后我用充满男子气概的方式把你抱住
And I took you in my arms, in a manly kind of way.

1262
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:06,580
像这样
Like this.

1263
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:09,180
然后说
And said,

1264
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:16,220
"罗茜  邓恩  你能带我去跳舞吗"
"Rosie Dunne, can I take you to the dance?"

1265
01:36:20,730 --> 01:36:22,260
总比没有来的好
Better late than never.
