1
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,047
2306, please.

2
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,919
Hello, honey.
How you doing?

3
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,863
Good.
What did he say?

4
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:50,494
Uh-huh. Is he still there?
How long ago did he leave?

5
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,472
Uh-huh. I'm stopping here,
then I got a little meeting,

6
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,169
and then I'll--
I would if I could.

7
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:00,371
As soon as I can.
Let me get off and I--

8
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:04,678
let me get off and I prom--
I promise you it'll be okay.

9
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:10,547
A bunch of bullshit.
Waste a good man's time.

10
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,833
Hi, could I speak
to Dr. Lowenstein, please?

11
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,528
It's rather important.
Could you get him for me?

12
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,299
Bunch of bullshit trying to make
a living on these deadbeat leads.

13
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,806
I swear to God, Shel,
I'm on a sit today--

14
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,140
Hello, Mrs. Swoboda,
this is Dave Moss.

15
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,203
Yeah, we spoke yesterday.

16
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,046
Now on the Rio Rancho Estates,
we've had a situation just come up.

17
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,711
The president of our company
is in town just one day,

18
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:43,085
- and he has certain parcels--
- Doctor--

19
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:46,182
well, could you get--
what do you mean?

20
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,989
He's not there?
I have to speak to him.

21
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,998
Yes, it is fairly urgent.
Mr. Levene.

22
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:57,332
No, I can't be reached.
I'll get back to him.

23
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,598
He has certain parcels--
certain choice parcels

24
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,163
which he's given me
a hold on for the next 48 hours.

25
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,177
What would be the best time to get
you and your husband together?

26
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:10,239
Say, tonight, at 10:00,
or tomorrow at 8:00?

27
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,774
Okay.

28
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:15,446
Okay, what would be
the best time to do that?

29
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,815
Look, you sent in the--
no, no, listen to me now--

30
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,623
I've got 48 hours
to make you a lot of money.

31
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:29,364
Well, when will he be home?
Fine, I'll call you back in 10 minutes.

32
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,598
They don't give you the leads,
they don't give you the support,

33
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,504
- they don't give you dick.
- Yeah.

34
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,566
Then they're yanking us in
on some sales conference.

35
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,738
When's the last time anybody
learned a goddamn thing?

36
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,180
All it does is some jerk
shoots his mouth off.

37
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:48,284
I swear to God, Shel, I got half a mind
to go across the street.

38
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,845
I got half a mind to go
with you if they'd take me.

39
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:55,087
You never know-- I was talking
to Jerry Graff last week.

40
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,323
I got to call
these deadbeats back.

41
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,628
I can't make a goddamn
dollar with these leads,

42
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,534
and you're killing my ass
on the street.

43
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,936
- I'm sorry you aren't happy here.
- That's cute,

44
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,497
but you're running this office
like a bunch of bullshit.

45
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,702
You're on an override--
you make money, we make money.

46
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,804
- I'd like you to make more money.
- Then don't go waste my time.

47
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,577
- A sales conference?
- The strategy comes from downtown.

48
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,915
Oh, the strategy?
The strategy?

49
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,011
- Well, I think I'll pass.
- I wouldn't.

50
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,955
- Why is that?
- When you come, then you'll see.

51
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:28,084
- Shelly.
- John.

52
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,220
Are you ready
to do or die tonight?

53
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,230
Oh yeah,
always ready, John.

54
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,630
Always ready, John.
Now, one thing--

55
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,669
we were talking about the leads.
We got some new ones ?

56
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,000
That's what we're going
to talk about at the meeting.

57
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,506
We are? Because I'm running
into a bit of a snag.

58
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,337
Yes, I've seen
your sales figures.

59
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,468
That's the leads.
You give me a better lead--

60
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,604
That's what we're going
to be talking about.

61
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,477
I'm in a bind--
personal problems.

62
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,346
- I could use a leg up.
- After the meeting.

63
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:54,581
- I hear the new Glengarry leads--
- After the meeting, Shel.

64
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,588
- Hey, Ricky.
- Hello, John.

65
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:59,216
- Wet out there tonight.
- Huh?

66
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:03,786
- Wet out there tonight.
- Uh-huh.

67
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,024
- Maybe it'll break the heat.
- Yeah.

68
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:12,866
Al, give me a quick J&B, huh?
Double.

69
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,702
Cutty, Al.

70
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,302
- They say...
- Huh?

71
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,146
they say it was so hot
downtown this afternoon,

72
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:28,711
grown men on the street corner
were going up to cops

73
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,484
begging the cops
to shoot them.

74
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:36,358
They say you should not drink
alcohol when it's so hot.

75
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:40,695
- Who says that?
- Something I read.

76
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:44,100
For they say
it dehydrates you.

77
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,003
They say
you should drink water,

78
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:51,237
but I subscribe to the law
of contrary public opinion.

79
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:55,670
If everyone thinks one thing,
then I say bet the other way.

80
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,884
Added to which,
you know they're wrong.

81
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:01,419
That's what I'm saying.

82
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:08,049
- Slow tonight.
- Oh, yeah.

83
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,220
Well, I guess
everybody's staying home.

84
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,594
If my daughter calls,
anybody calls,

85
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:16,226
I'm over at the office.
Thanks.

86
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,664
I had a woman
in White Plains on the hook--

87
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:54,706
five units, Mountain View--
what happens ?

88
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,605
She has to check
with her lawyer.

89
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,236
- You let her check with her lawyer?
- What could I do?

90
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,837
- I dunno.
- Shelly.

91
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,007
- Huh?
- Who's the guy?

92
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,017
Couldn't tell you.

93
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:09,782
I don't like the whole thing,
because all I need is a lead.

94
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,585
- They won't give out--
- Uh-huh.

95
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,251
The rich get richer,
that's the law of the land.

96
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,488
Who belongs
to the BM--?

97
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,599
It is 7:30.

98
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,830
So who is that?

99
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,840
And where is
Mr. Roma ?

100
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,569
Well, I'm not a leash,
so I don't know, do I?

101
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:35,704
Let me have
your attention for a moment.

102
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:39,012
You're talking about what?
You're talking about--

103
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,445
bitching about
that sale you shot,

104
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,717
some son of a bitch
don't want to buy land,

105
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,155
somebody don't want
what you're selling,

106
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,160
some broad you're
trying to screw, so forth.

107
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,287
Let's talk
about something important.

108
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,990
- Are they all here?
- All but one.

109
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,020
I'm going anyway.

110
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:56,626
Let's talk
about something important.

111
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,068
Put that coffee down.

112
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,645
Coffee's for closers only.

113
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,549
You think
I'm fucking with you?

114
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,784
I am not fucking with you.

115
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,718
I'm here from downtown.

116
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,350
I'm here
from Mitch and Murray.

117
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:24,590
And I'm here
on a mission of mercy.

118
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,993
- Your name's Levene?
- Yeah.

119
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,871
You call yourself a salesman,
you son of a bitch?

120
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,671
I don't got to listen
to this shit.

121
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:41,008
You certainly don't, 'cause
the good news is, you're fired.

122
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,546
The bad news is you've got--
all of you've got--

123
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,609
just one week
to regain your jobs,

124
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:51,145
starting with tonight--
starting with tonight's sit.

125
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:57,025
Oh, have I got
your attention now?

126
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,959
Good...

127
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,127
'cause we're adding
a little something

128
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,864
to this month's
sales contest.

129
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,998
As you all know, first prize
is a Cadillac Eldorado.

130
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,100
Anybody want to see
second prize?

131
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:14,613
Second prize is
a set of steak knives.

132
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,481
Third prize is you're fired.

133
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,918
Do you get the picture?
Are you laughing now?

134
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:31,396
You got leads. Mitch and Murray
paid good money.

135
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,625
Get their names
to sell them.

136
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,724
You can't close
the leads you're given,

137
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,463
you can't close shit,
you are shit!

138
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:42,064
Hit the bricks, pal, and beat it,
'cause you are going out!

139
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,599
- The leads are weak.
- The leads are weak?

140
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,408
The fucking leads are weak?
You're weak.

141
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,449
I've been
in this business 15 years.

142
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,814
- What's your name?
- Fuck you--

143
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,410
that's my name!
You know why, mister?

144
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,615
Because you drove a Hyundai
to get here tonight,

145
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,593
I drove an $80,000 BMW.
That's my name.

146
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,926
And your name
is "You're wanting."

147
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,165
You can't play in the man's game?
You can't close them?

148
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,606
Then go home and tell your wife
your troubles.

149
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,441
Because only one thing
counts in this life--

150
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,880
get them to sign
on the line which is dotted!

151
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:26,884
You hear me,
you fucking faggots ?

152
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,560
"A-B-C."

153
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,621
A-- Always,
B-- Be, C-- Closing.

154
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,633
Always Be Closing.

155
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,364
"Always Be Closing."

156
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,102
"A-I-D-A."

157
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,870
"Attention, Interest,
Decision, Action."

158
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,411
Attention--
Do I have your attention?

159
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,606
Interest--
Are you interested?

160
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,945
I know you are,
because it's fuck or walk.

161
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,008
You close
or you hit the bricks.

162
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:04,318
Decision-- Have you made
your decision for Christ?

163
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:09,054
And Action.
"A-I-D-A."

164
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,426
Get out there--
you got the prospects coming in.

165
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,658
You think they came in
to get out of the rain?

166
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,133
A guy don't walk on the lot
lest he wants to buy.

167
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,501
They're sitting out there
waiting to give you their money.

168
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,597
Are you gonna take it?

169
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,802
Are you man enough
to take it?

170
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,242
Crap.

171
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,219
What's the problem, pal?
You-- Moss.

172
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,755
You're such a hero,
you're so rich,

173
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:41,088
how come you're here wasting
your time with a bunch of bums ?

174
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,729
You see this watch?

175
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:52,133
- You see this watch?
- Yeah.

176
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:55,401
That watch costs
more than your car.

177
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:59,535
I made $9 70,000 last year.
How much you make?

178
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:06,951
You see, pal... that's who I am,
and you're nothing.

179
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,887
Nice guy?
I don't give a shit.

180
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,949
Good father? Fuck you--
go home and play with your kids.

181
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:19,555
You want to work here--
close!

182
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,897
You think this is abuse?

183
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,027
You think this is abuse,
you cocksucker?

184
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:28,767
You can't take this, how can you
take the abuse you get on a sit?

185
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:33,334
You don't like it, leave.

186
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,715
I can go out there tonight--
the materials you got--

187
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:42,880
make myself $15,000.
Tonight-- in two hours!

188
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,786
Can you?

189
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,554
Can you?

190
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,522
Go and do likewise.
"A-I-D-A."

191
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,193
Get mad, you son of a bitches.
Get mad!

192
00:13:56,268 --> 00:14:00,204
You know what it takes
to sell real estate?

193
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:03,969
It takes brass balls
to sell real estate.

194
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,309
Go and do likewise,
gents.

195
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,783
The money's out there--
you pick it up, it's yours,

196
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,151
you don't,
I got no sympathy for you.

197
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,053
You want to go out
on those sits tonight and close--

198
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,852
close-- it's yours.

199
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,086
Not, you're gonna be
shining my shoes.

200
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,891
And you know
what you'll be saying.

201
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,592
Bunch of losers
sitting around in a bar,

202
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:31,762
"Oh yeah, I used to be a salesman.
It's a tough racket."

203
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,913
These are the new leads.

204
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:46,042
These are
the Glengarry leads.

205
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:50,817
And to you, they're gold.
And you don't get them.

206
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,654
Why?

207
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,719
Because to give them to you
is just throwing them away.

208
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,168
They're for closers.

209
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,504
I'd wish you good luck,

210
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,841
but you wouldn't know what
to do with it if you got it.

211
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:23,013
And to answer your question, pal--
"Why am I here?"

212
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,057
I came here because
Mitch and Murray asked me to.

213
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,821
They asked me for a favor.
I said, "The real favor--

214
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,886
follow my advice
and fire your fucking ass,

215
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,455
because a loser
is a loser."

216
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,070
Bunch of fucking nonsense--

217
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,843
treat people like that.

218
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,577
The fuck is he going
to get off?

219
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:59,021
- Mickey Mouse sales conference.
- He didn't mean it.

220
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,958
I'm sure he didn't mean it about
trimming down the sales quota.

221
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,222
Where is Roma ?
Where the hell is Mr. Ricky Roma ?

222
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,662
All the while we got to sit here,
eat this nonsense?

223
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,860
Hello? Mr. Levene.
How's she doing?

224
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,926
Uh-huh, yeah.
Is she awake?

225
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,529
Oh, the doctor came by.
What did he say?

226
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:18,167
Uh-huh.
I can't come in tonight.

227
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:21,007
I think-- I know she is.
I know that she is.

228
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,948
I've gotta go out. Will you please
tell her when she wakes ?

229
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:28,976
I've got to go out.
Tell her I'll call her from the road.

230
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,646
Thank you.

231
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,052
Gentlemen,
you heard the man.

232
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,925
What is this in aid of?

233
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,090
- As of tonight--
- What is this ? Excuse me.

234
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,326
What it's in aid of
is that Mitch and Murray--

235
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:45,131
Fuck Mitch and Murray!
I'm doing my job,

236
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,001
I got to put up
with this childishness ?

237
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,937
I don't make the rules.
I'm paid to run the office.

238
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,374
You don't like the rules, Dave?
There's the door!

239
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:57,873
Two lead cards for tonight,
two lead cards for tomorrow.

240
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,679
As you heard,
end of the month,

241
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,845
top salesman on the board
gets the Eldorado.

242
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,047
- Next man down the--
- What about the good leads ?

243
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,489
- The leads I've given you.
- But these leads are shit.

244
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,389
They're old--
I've seen that name 100 times.

245
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:11,624
- The leads are assigned randomly.
- What about the new leads ?

246
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,494
The new leads--
the Glengarry leads.

247
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,897
I've got them.
I'm going to hang onto them.

248
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,061
And they'll be
assigned to closers,

249
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,503
based on the sales volume,
first to Roma.

250
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,506
- Where is Roma ?
- Don't worry about Roma.

251
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,201
He'll get his leads,
you've got yours.

252
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,403
He's top name on the board,
so he don't have to be here?

253
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,969
That's correct!
And as the hour is waning,

254
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,881
I suggest you-- those of you
who are interested

255
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,748
in a continuing job with
this organization, get to work.

256
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,845
That's garbage.
Bullshit.

257
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,617
- Thank you for your attention.
- Bullshit!

258
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,820
How am I supposed to close these?
Look at this.

259
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,864
I've had this guy before.
I've been to his house twice.

260
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:49,662
I-- I can't--
I can't close this stuff.

261
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,406
Shelly, how am I
supposed to--

262
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,136
They're going
to bounce me out of a job.

263
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:09,746
Hello, Mr. Palermo?
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:13,189
Mr. Speice?
Mr. Robert Speice?

265
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,227
Yeah,
this is George Aaronow.

266
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:19,389
I'm with Rio.
I spoke with your wife earlier.

267
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:22,992
I'm the vice president of Rio Rancho
Properties in Furman, Arizona.

268
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:28,301
Yes. I'm calling from the airport,
and consulting my map,

269
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,603
I see that you and your wife
live near the airport.

270
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:33,702
I have some rather--
rather unusual,

271
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,009
rather good information
on the property...

272
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:40,484
Hello? Hello, this is
Sheldon Levene.

273
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,180
Please listen closely--
I only have a moment or so.

274
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,850
I can speak only
to a Mrs. Nyborg.

275
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:50,884
Oh, this is Mrs. Nyborg.
Please listen closely, Mrs. Nyborg.

276
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:54,660
I'm calling from Consolidated
Properties of Arizona.

277
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:58,464
Our computer has chosen you
from all of the many thousands

278
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,370
who write in requesting
information on our properties.

279
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,432
Now by federal law,
as you probably know,

280
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,741
the prize must be awarded to you
even if you are not engaged

281
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,804
in our land
development plan.

282
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:13,511
The only stipulation, of course,
is that you and your husband

283
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:16,748
must sign at the same time
for the receipt of your prize.

284
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:21,225
Now, I will be in the area
tonight, possibly tomorrow.

285
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,853
What do you think might be
a convenient time to meet

286
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,056
with both you
and your husband?

287
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,759
Of course I'll hold.

288
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,576
- Bunch of fucking nonsense, huh?
- I can't close them.

289
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,174
- Nobody can close 'em.
- They're old.

290
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,446
They're ancient--
a bunch of fucking nonsense.

291
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,818
Get some jerk
to come in here--

292
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,687
Sometimes I think,
"I wonder if I belong in this business."

293
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,125
Send a guy out there--
no support, no confidence.

294
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,857
Then I say,
"Nobody can close 'em."

295
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,456
- Then I look at Roma.
- Roma-- fuck Roma.

296
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,592
Had a freak--
a little run of luck.

297
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,103
The leads are garbage.

298
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,264
Then I say,
"Why give him the good leads ?

299
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,467
- He doesn't need 'em."
- You going out?

300
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:15,138
Yeah. I have to go out.
I can't make a sit.

301
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:19,116
- Have you tried?
- Yeah. Something's wrong with me.

302
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,152
What is it?
I can't push through.

303
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,450
Get your coat on.
You're coming out with me.

304
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,615
- Something in me.
- Forget it.

305
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,751
- I try, I try.
- I said forget it, come on.

306
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,091
I can't close 'em.

307
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,361
Life.

308
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,665
I swear to God,
you work all your life--

309
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,833
- Forget it, George.
- Roma, so on...

310
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,308
- so gifted.
- Gifted, my ass!

311
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,938
- The guy gets a string of luck.
- No, no, no.

312
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,709
The thing of it is,
money's tight.

313
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:52,647
When times are tight,
it don't do no good

314
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,084
to throw around,
"Just go out and sell."

315
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,883
Threaten a man all you want,
you can't whip a dead horse.

316
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,480
- Nope.
- All this garbage--

317
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,048
"Sell 10,000,
you win a Cadillac;

318
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:04,425
you lose, we're gonna fire
your ass"? It's medieval.

319
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,690
- Yes.
- It's wrong.

320
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,231
- Yes.
- Yes it is,

321
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,823
and you know
who's responsible?

322
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,868
- Who?
- You know who it is.

323
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,836
It's Mitch and Murray,
'cause it don't have to be this way.

324
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,930
- No.
- Look at Jerry Graff.

325
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,998
He's clean, he's doing
business for himself,

326
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,236
he's got that list--
with the nurses ?

327
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:24,248
You see? That's thinking.
Why take a 10% sales commission?

328
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:27,285
Why are we giving the rest away?
What are we giving 90% for?

329
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,980
For nothing.
For some jerk in the office,

330
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,387
telling us, "Get out there and close,
go win a Cadillac."

331
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,085
Graff goes out and buys.
He pays top dollar.

332
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,593
- You see?
- Yes.

333
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,631
For the leads-- that's thinking.
Now, he's got the leads,

334
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:43,896
he goes in business for himself.
That's what? That's thinking.

335
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,903
Who-- who's got
a steady job,

336
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,098
a regular job,
a couple of bucks nobody's touched?

337
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,663
Nurses.

338
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,368
Graff goes and buys
a fucking list of nurses. One grand--

339
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,809
he paid two, I'll eat my hat.
4,000 or 5,000 nurses.

340
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,279
- He's going wild.
- He is ?

341
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:59,579
- Yeah, he's doing very well.
- I heard they were running cold.

342
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,448
- The nurses ?
- Yeah.

343
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,683
You hear a lot of things.
He's doing very well.

344
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,621
- With River Oaks ?
- River Oaks, Brook Farms.

345
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:09,388
All that shit. Somebody told me--
you know what he's clearing, himself?

346
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:12,259
- 14, 15 grand a week.
- Himself?

347
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,664
That's what I'm saying.
Why? He's got the leads.

348
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,794
He's got the good leads.
What are we?

349
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,633
We're sitting
in the shit here. Why?

350
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,537
Because we got to go to them
to get them.

351
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:25,508
90% of our sales we're paying
to the office for the leads.

352
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:29,013
There's our leads, there's overhead,
phones, a lot of stuff.

353
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,049
What do you need?
A telephone?

354
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:34,279
Some broad to say, "Good morning"?
Nothing. It's the leads.

355
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,651
The whole thing is the leads,
you understand me?

356
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:39,520
You can't sell to a void--
you got to get a goddamn person.

357
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:42,151
You get a lead, you get
a person-- I'll go sell 'em.

358
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,024
Otherwise, what do they want
from my life?

359
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:48,126
Hello, Danny?
Dan, it's Shel Levene.

360
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,226
Yeah, we spoke--
last May I called you.

361
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:54,500
I was in town from my estate
in Rio Rancho, and--

362
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,302
Arizona.

363
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,605
I wish we could have
gotten together at that time.

364
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:02,477
Danny, that piece of property I had
for you has increased in value--

365
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:07,746
Grace, Grace,
what was that figure? $ 76,000.

366
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,287
Oh, Danny, I wish you could have
been in on it with me.

367
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,949
Look, I'm here overnight--
I have to go home tomorrow,

368
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:16,892
and I thought, after the interest
you showed on the last trip, that--

369
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:20,830
Hold it, Grace. Danny,
I know that you're serious,

370
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,993
and because of that, I am going
to shove my appointments around

371
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:28,096
and make sure--
oh, gee, I wish that--

372
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:33,137
All right, Danny.
Yeah, all right.

373
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:47,020
Going out tonight,
Shelly?

374
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:52,830
What is this bullshit
with the sales promotion?

375
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,388
It isn't bullshit.
It's the way it is.

376
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,559
You're going to fire
the bottom men on the list?

377
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,035
That's the way it is
and I don't make the rules.

378
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,437
- The rules come from downtown.
- I got a problem here, John.

379
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,998
- I'm closing up the office.
- Come have a drink with me.

380
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:08,341
- I've got to get home.
- Do me the courtesy-- five minutes ?

381
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,574
I am trying to get home
for two hours.

382
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,641
I got to go home, grab one hour
with my kids, come back here,

383
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,209
see if any of you closed
a contract, take the contract--

384
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,815
- How about one minute?
- What is it?

385
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,950
- I can't close these leads.
- Then move on.

386
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:25,895
Don't jump! Don't jump out
of your manager bag a second.

387
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:30,230
It's just two guys talking,
am I right? We're just talking.

388
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,896
You got the new leads.
If you would give me-- just hold on.

389
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,735
The Glengarry leads are to be
assigned only to closers.

390
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,537
Hold on a second.
If you give me the good leads--

391
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,237
You blew the last good one
I gave you.

392
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,973
No, no-- hold on,
will you?

393
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,641
I did not blow 'em.
One kicked out. One, I closed.

394
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,616
- You didn't close it.
- Would you listen to me?

395
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:50,485
I closed that cocksucker!
His ex! John, his ex!

396
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:53,023
I didn't even know he was married.
The judge invalidated it.

397
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:53,989
Shelly--

398
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,619
What was that job, huh?
Bad luck. That's all it was.

399
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,890
I pray you never find it--
it runs in streaks.

400
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:01,865
That's what it's doing,
that's all it does-- streaks.

401
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:05,528
I pray that it misses you
and that's all I have to say.

402
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:08,596
Shit, I've got to eat.
Williamson--

403
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:12,803
look at the sheets.
Look at the sheets.

404
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:16,575
198 7, '88, '89--
six months in '89-- who's on top ?

405
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,115
- Roma.
- Under him?

406
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:20,947
- Moss.
- Oh, bullshit, John!

407
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,613
April to September it's me--
it's no fucking Moss.

408
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,020
Due respect,
he's an order-taker.

409
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:29,788
Talk-- talks a good game,
but look on the board, it's me.

410
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,022
- Not lately it isn't.
- Not late--

411
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,492
Well, lately--
kiss my ass "lately."

412
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:37,228
You call Murray and you call Mitch--
when we were on Peterson,

413
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,964
who do you think bought the new car?
Call Mitch. The Seville?

414
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,132
He came in here--
"You bought that for me, fella."

415
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:47,110
And out of what? Hey, look at me!
Out of what? Nothing!

416
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,408
Cold calling.
You want to talk about a sale?

417
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:52,006
You are really
beginning to burn my ass, kid.

418
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:56,417
I can't get a lead, you--
it was skill, John.

419
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,956
It could be working for you--
you want to throw it away.

420
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,219
- It isn't me.
- It's not you--

421
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,818
I wonder who it is.
Who the fuck am I talking to?

422
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:07,661
- I need the leads to sell.
- After the contest. After the 30th.

423
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,962
Bullshit,
"After the contest."

424
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:12,731
If I'm not on that board by the 30th,
they're going to can my ass.

425
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:19,536
I need those leads
and I need 'em now or I'm out.

426
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:30,451
You're going to miss me.
I swear to you, you will miss me.

427
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,285
Let me tell you
something, Shelly.

428
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:35,383
I do what I'm hired to do--
you might do the same.

429
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,325
- Jesus.
- Now wait a second!

430
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:42,866
I'm hired to watch the leads,
to marshal my sales force.

431
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,061
I'm given a policy.
My job is to do that.

432
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:47,195
Marshal your sales force?

433
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,934
Anybody falls below
a certain mark, I'm directed.

434
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,976
I'm not permitted
to give them the premium leads.

435
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:56,002
How do they rise
above that mark? With dreck?

436
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,413
With this toilet paper
you're giving me?

437
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:00,075
You give me
one premium lead--

438
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,846
Do you know what
the premium leads cost?

439
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,184
Do I know what
the premium leads cost?

440
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:05,688
Yeah,
I know what they cost.

441
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,988
I generated the sufficient
dollar revenue to buy them.

442
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,052
But I cannot sell shit!

443
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,690
Jesus. And I've seen
these before, you know.

444
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,700
Christ, I saw these back--
Homestead--

445
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:19,100
1985, we pitched
these cocksuckers Baywater.

446
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:23,470
They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.
They're broke. They're deadbeats.

447
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:26,476
Just give me some leads that don't
come out of a phone book.

448
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:29,240
You give me something hotter
than that and I can close it.

449
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,509
It's just a streak.
I'm gonna turn it around.

450
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,848
Hey, I need your help.

451
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,821
I can't do it,
Shelly.

452
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,358
John...

453
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:50,094
I'll give you 10%.

454
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,728
- Of what?
- My end-- what I close.

455
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:55,739
You give me the premium leads,
you're in for 10%, what I close.

456
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,672
- And what if you don't close?
- I will.

457
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,767
- What if you don't close?
- I will close.

458
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,937
What if you don't,
you understand?

459
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,914
Then I'm fucked. You think you're
the only guy with a family?

460
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,712
- You see what I'm saying?
- John--

461
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:09,049
I step out and you don't close,
then it's my job.

462
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,088
- Then I'm fucked.
- I will close!

463
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,886
Now, 10% John--
I can get hot, you know that.

464
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,518
- Not lately you can't.
- That's defeatist-- fuck it!

465
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:19,529
Go with me. Get on my side
and let's do something.

466
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:22,259
You want to run this office?
You heard what the man said--

467
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,767
"Attack."
Let's do something.

468
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:29,239
- Huh?
- 20%.

469
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:33,270
- All right.
- And 50 bucks a lead.

470
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,335
- No?
- Oh!

471
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,983
Oh, shit.

472
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:01,735
Listen...
I got to talk to you.

473
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:06,675
Permit me to do this a second.
I'm older than you.

474
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:10,078
A man acquires a reputation
on the street.

475
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,878
What he does when he's up,
what he does at other times...

476
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:16,148
I said, "10," you said, "No."
You said, "20," I said, "Fine."

477
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:19,622
Now you want to throw
this 50-buck thing in.

478
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:24,560
John, a good deal-- has got to be
one where both parties--

479
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:27,860
Okay, okay, okay, fine--
20%, 50 bucks a lead. It's done.

480
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,832
Let's go out.
We make some money.

481
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:32,529
I got bills to pay.
I want two sits tonight

482
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,266
and I want the good leads--
the Glengarry leads-- two.

483
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,535
Two, John, because
I am going to close 'em both.

484
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,407
It's a long road
with no turning, pally.

485
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:43,345
Huh? Okay.
Now, let's go.

486
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:46,008
I've got to go back
to the office to get 'em.

487
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:49,986
Go on, let's go.
This is what I was saying, John.

488
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:52,750
All you need, a little boost,
you turn a streak around.

489
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:55,850
Am I right? Good, huh?
Huh, good?

490
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:58,361
What?

491
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:01,193
- What?
- Two leads, 100 bucks.

492
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,359
- Now?
- Now, yes. When?

493
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,698
- Shit, John.
- I wish I could.

494
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,466
You fucking asshole.

495
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,805
I don't have it--
I don't--

496
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:14,208
I'll bring it in the office
in the morning.

497
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,679
- I'll be coming with the sales.
- Nope.

498
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,813
I can't fucking
believe this.

499
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:25,219
All right, here's...

500
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,121
20... 30, and--

501
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:30,753
Jesus, here's the 30.
I'll bring the rest in tomorrow.

502
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,024
We got to do this, huh, pal?
For Christ's sake!

503
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,928
No.

504
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:40,934
- My daughter...
- I can't do it, Shelly.

505
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:44,065
I got to tell you something.
It wasn't so long ago,

506
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:48,044
I'd pick up the phone
and call Murray-- I got your job.

507
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:51,513
"Murray, the kid is burning my ass."
"Shelly, he's gone."

508
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:56,384
You are gone before
I'm back from lunch.

509
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,183
Bought him a trip
to Bermuda once.

510
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,087
- I've got to go.
- All right, hey.

511
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:04,686
Give me-- I'll take two more
of the old leads.

512
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:07,356
- I gave you two today.
- One is a bust-out, John!

513
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,423
- The other ain't home!
- Shelly--

514
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,626
I promise you,
I've been on the phone-- I know.

515
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,363
No more leads today--
two per day. You've got yours.

516
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,462
All right.

517
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,939
- All right?
- Sure.

518
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:26,640
We will do that...
other thing.

519
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:31,516
I guess I left
my wallet in my room.

520
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,688
Deadbeats.
Deadbeats, all of 'em.

521
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:44,462
My mistake.
I shouldn't have took the leads.

522
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:46,833
- You had to.
- Yeah? Why?

523
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,135
- To get on the--
- To get on the board, yeah.

524
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,300
How am I gonna get on the board
trying to sell a doctor?

525
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,139
Two regular,
two chocolate donuts.

526
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:56,271
Give me the same thing to go.
And don't try and sell an Indian.

527
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:58,042
I will never try to sell
an Indian.

528
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,380
These names come up--
you ever get 'em-- "Patel"?

529
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:03,420
- You ever get 'em?
- I think I had one once.

530
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,786
You had one,
you'd know it-- "Patel."

531
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,518
They keep coming up.
I don't know.

532
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,924
They like to talk to salesmen.
They're lonely.

533
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,724
They like to feel superior--
never bought a fucking thing.

534
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:15,391
I don't know.
Come down the line--

535
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:19,926
doctors, lawyers, Indians--
times are tight. It's tight.

536
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:24,498
Pressure's just too great.
Man can't work all of 'em.

537
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:28,306
You go in the door-- I got to close
this fucker or I don't eat lunch,

538
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:32,110
or I don't win a Cadillac.
We work too hard, George.

539
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:39,586
Remember when we were-- when we
were selling Glen Ross Farms ?

540
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:41,921
Didn't we sell
a bunch of that?

541
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:44,154
- They came in--
- They fucked it up.

542
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,219
- They did.
- They killed the goose. And now...

543
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,595
- We're stuck with this--
- Stuck with this fucking shit.

544
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,293
- This shit.
- It's too...

545
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,632
- It is.
- You get a bad month--

546
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:56,140
they put you on this board.
Some contest board.

547
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:58,675
- It's not right.
- It's not right to the customers.

548
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:01,041
I know, it's-- hey. What did I learn
as a kid on Western?

549
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:07,116
Don't sell a guy one car.
Sell him five cars over 15 years.

550
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,914
- That's right.
- You're goddamn right, it's right.

551
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,956
Guys come in-- "Oh, the blah,
blah, blah. I know what I'll do.

552
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:14,423
I'll go out and rob everybody
blind and go to Argentina

553
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,357
'cause nobody ever
thought of this before."

554
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:19,294
So they kill the goose
and the man's worked all his life--

555
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,264
- That's right.
- He's got to cower in his boots--

556
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,425
Boots, yes...

557
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,833
For some fucking "Sell 10,000,
win the steak knives."

558
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:27,803
- What do you do?
- What can you do?

559
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:30,272
What can you do
if you don't have the leads ?

560
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,071
If you do not
have the goddamn leads!

561
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:36,178
Mr. Spannel?
Sheldon Levene.

562
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,272
I was speaking
to your wife earlier?

563
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,214
Come in.

564
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,680
- "Cats and dogs," huh?
- Yeah.

565
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:46,383
Oh, "cats and dogs."

566
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,491
Oh, I see you're
interested in fishing.

567
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:54,258
- Yeah.
- I've fished myself-- many years.

568
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:57,165
Muskee, Wisconsin.
Ooh, a beauty.

569
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:01,904
- Where's the missus ?
- Out at the PTA.

570
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,838
- Ahh.
- What was this in reference...?

571
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:05,967
I spoke to your wife
earlier on the phone.

572
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,944
I called, I'm in town
with Rio Rancho.

573
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:11,209
Yes, I'm sorry. She said you had
some sort of award?

574
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:14,547
Yes, I was speaking to the people
in my sales organization--

575
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:18,385
my representatives in this area--
and Mr. Spannel--

576
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:21,289
your name is Larry.
Mind if I call you Larry?

577
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,056
All right, Larry.
We had a consultant,

578
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:28,257
and he made me--
he made me an offer.

579
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:31,893
He offered me $230,000
to promote a sales plan--

580
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:36,497
to present investment opportunities
in Rio Rancho to the public.

581
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,839
Well, I said, "Hell,
let me save you the 230,

582
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:43,005
and pass the savings
along to the investor."

583
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,244
My people immediately said,
"Whoa, how do you do that?

584
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:49,286
How can you present
investment opportunities

585
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,548
without television,
without magazine ads ?"

586
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,522
I said, "You take
something this good,

587
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,821
you go to a man--
has invested in the past--

588
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:59,761
you go to him direct and offer
the money to him-- rebate.

589
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,959
And don't give it
to this expert."

590
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,427
So you're here
to sell me some land?

591
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,699
No, I wouldn't try
to sell you--

592
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:12,106
I leave that to the salesmen
and people who want to own land.

593
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,940
I think something
has to be fed,

594
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,947
watered and painted,
but don't invest in it.

595
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:20,540
That motto has stood me
in good stead.

596
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,813
- Mister--
- Just call me Shelly.

597
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:25,117
I have never
been afraid of familiarity.

598
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:27,214
I'm walking out the door.
I've got to pick up my wife at the--

599
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,691
Let's take my car.
We'll pick her up together.

600
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,990
Spoke to the little woman
on the phone-- can't wait to meet her.

601
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,860
No, we're going
over to our relatives'.

602
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:36,593
- She didn't say anything about that.
- I'm sure she forgot.

603
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:39,295
- I'm on a plane to Florida--
- I'm sorry if we put you out.

604
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,895
You didn't put me out.
I'm just trying to think, Larry.

605
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,533
You know, that's the only parcel
that I've got.

606
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:47,339
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go back to the computer,

607
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:50,574
I'm gonna pull another one, and we're
gonna speak to your relatives, too.

608
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,014
- No, no, no.
- C'mon, you're a busy man, so am I.

609
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,951
My God, I'm in the act
of giving a gift away.

610
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,955
Look, I don't want to buy land.
I don't want to invest in land.

611
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:03,585
I have nothing. She took the call
without my knowledge.

612
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,925
I have no business
that I wish to transact.

613
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,828
I don't want to tell you
how to handle your wife.

614
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:11,733
My wife filled in a form, and we
have been plagued for the last year--

615
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,771
That's the situation
I'm trying to alleviate, Larry.

616
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,636
No, no.
Do you understand?

617
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,707
Thank you. No.

618
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:37,689
- Roma, man-- he don't care.
- He don't care.

619
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:41,198
He's sitting on top of the world.
He's got good leads, good prospects.

620
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,665
- Sales, sales.
- Sales contests.

621
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:46,532
- That's what I'm saying.
- Times turn hard, they bounce you out.

622
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:48,629
If they bounce you with no
confidence--

623
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,300
That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying to you.

624
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:59,138
If they get you
on a bad beat--

625
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,685
and you got to go out there,
get a new job--

626
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:03,515
- With no--
- With no confidence--

627
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,112
Yes.

628
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:09,421
I'll tell you what the hard part is--
to stop thinking like a goddamn slave.

629
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:12,985
You say the Nazis
in Europe--
"If they came in my door"--

630
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,430
bullshit, the time is now.
What do you do now?

631
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,831
Some guy pissing in your face.
Cocksucker--

632
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,336
wants to break your rice bowl.

633
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,999
Mitch and Murray, fuck you.
What I say-- fuck you!

634
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,873
Sitting on the good leads.

635
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:29,777
George, we're men here.

636
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,376
Yes.

637
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:36,386
And I'll tell you--
I'll tell you what the hard part is.

638
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:39,048
- What?
- Starting up.

639
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:41,853
Standing up.
Breaking free of this bullshit,

640
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,623
this enslavement to some guy,
'cause he's got the upper hand.

641
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:51,334
This is the difference--
listen to me, George.

642
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,563
Now Jerry Graff went
into business for himself.

643
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:59,235
He said, "I'm going on my own."
And he was free, you understand me?

644
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,436
I'll tell you-- I'll tell you
what somebody should do.

645
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:07,473
What?

646
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:10,179
Somebody should stand up
and strike back.

647
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,586
Somebody should do something
to them.

648
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,887
- What?
- Something to pay them back.

649
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,790
Someone should hurt them,
Mitch and Murray.

650
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:18,556
- Somebody should hurt them?
- Yeah.

651
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,494
- How?
- Someone should do something

652
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:22,293
- to hurt them where they live.
- What?

653
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:25,563
Someone should rob the office.
That's what I'm saying.

654
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:29,072
If we were that kind of guy
to hold up the joint and trash it,

655
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,200
it looks like robbery,
we take the leads out of the files

656
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:34,210
and we go to Jerry Graff.

657
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:38,146
And we take the fucking
Glengarry leads! Huh?

658
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:44,250
Yeah, Mr. Nyborg? Ah, Mr. Nyborg,
Sheldon Levene.

659
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,916
I was speaking to your wife earlier.
That's right.

660
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:50,620
I'd like to speak to you
about awarding you your prize.

661
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,686
We're coming to the end
of our fiscal year,

662
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:55,459
I'd really like to get it
off the books before--

663
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:58,525
yes, the prize
for Consolidated Properties.

664
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:01,127
The information you requested
on Rio Rancho.

665
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:04,402
Now, I'm in town only for--
well, let me see.

666
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:07,444
I suppose I could
swing by tonight. Yes. Uh-huh.

667
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,105
When do you think
it might be more convenient?

668
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:12,741
As I said,
I could swing by tonight--

669
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:15,308
well, of course,
you speak to your wife.

670
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:17,320
Grace, I'm gonna need

671
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,948
a first-class seat,
passport, 10,000 in cash,

672
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,288
put that with the negotiable
papers, if you would.

673
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,558
And put me
on the telex hookup-- yes ?

674
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:30,122
Well, when do you think
Mrs. Nyborg might be back?

675
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:33,626
All train compartments
smell vaguely of shit.

676
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,901
It gets so you don't
mind it.

677
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:40,137
That's the worst thing
that I can confess.

678
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,805
You know how long it took me
to get there? A long time.

679
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:48,985
When you die you're gonna regret
the things you don't do.

680
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:52,147
You think you're queer?
I'm gonna tell you something.

681
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,659
We're all queer.
You think you're a thief? So what?

682
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,320
You get befuddled
by a middle-class morality?

683
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,330
Get shut of it.
Shut it out.

684
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:04,494
You cheat on your wife,
you did it. Live with it.

685
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,833
You fuck little girls,
so be it.

686
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:11,671
There's an absolute morality?
Maybe.

687
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,370
And then what?

688
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:17,972
If you think there is,
go ahead, be that thing.

689
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:21,015
Bad people go to hell?
I don't think so.

690
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,019
You think that,
act that way.

691
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:29,492
A hell exists on earth?
Yes. I won't live in it.

692
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,551
That's me.

693
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:40,135
Did you ever take a dump, made you
feel like you slept for 12 hours ?

694
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,866
- Did I...?
- Yes.

695
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,432
- I don't know.
- Or a piss ?

696
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:53,784
Great meals fade
in reflection.

697
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:56,547
Everything else gains.
Do you know why?

698
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,987
'Cause it's only food.
This shit we put in us,

699
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:02,491
keeps us going--
it's only food.

700
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:06,059
The great fucks
you may have had,

701
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,064
what do you remember
about them?

702
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:12,193
- What do I remember?
- Yeah.

703
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:15,733
I don't know.
For me,

704
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:19,264
I'm saying what it is,
it's probably not the orgasm.

705
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:24,744
Some broad's forearm
on your neck,

706
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:29,252
something her eyes did.
There was this sound she made.

707
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:33,252
Or it's me in the--
I'm telling you--

708
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:37,260
I'm in bed the next day,
she brought me cafe au lait,

709
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,764
gives me a cigarette,
my balls feel like concrete.

710
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,355
Eh?

711
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:46,800
What I'm saying,
what is our life?

712
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:52,203
Our life is looking forward
or it's looking back.

713
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:56,110
That's it.
That's our life.

714
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,774
Where's the moment?

715
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,256
And what is it
we're so afraid of?

716
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,223
Loss. What else?

717
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:13,423
The bank closes, we get sick,
my wife died on a plane?

718
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:18,096
The stock market collapsed?
What of these things happen?

719
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:21,262
None of them.
We worry anyway. Why?

720
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:24,630
What could we get
for them?

721
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,438
- For them?
- For the leads.

722
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:29,536
What could we get
for the leads ?

723
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:33,982
I don't know. 10 bucks a throw.
15 maybe. I don't know.

724
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,215
For the leads, you're saying?
Say somebody took them,

725
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:41,417
- went to Jerry Graff?
- Yeah. How many leads do we have?

726
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:42,823
The Glengarry?
The premium leads ?

727
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:46,090
I've got to think they've got 500.
Say 500 leads.

728
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:49,428
You're saying a fella could take
those leads and sell them to Graff?

729
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,764
The leads to Graff.
Yes. I was saying-- yeah.

730
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:54,429
A guy could take--
like anything else, it seems to me,

731
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:57,030
that is negotiable,
a guy could sell them.

732
00:42:57,107 --> 00:43:00,508
- How do you know he'd buy them?
- Because I worked for him.

733
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:04,275
- You didn't talk to him?
- No. What do you mean?

734
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:06,441
- Did I talk to him about this ?
- Yeah.

735
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:08,815
Are you just talking about this,
or are we just talking about it?

736
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:11,320
- Just speaking about it.
- Speaking about it as an idea ?

737
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:13,481
- Yes.
- We're not actually talking about it.

738
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:16,321
- No.
- Talking about it as a robbery.

739
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:19,157
As a robbery? No.

740
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,829
- Well...
- Hey.

741
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:26,699
So all this--
you didn't actually call Graff?

742
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,204
- You didn't talk to him?
- Not actually, no.

743
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,537
- You didn't?
- No, not actually.

744
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,201
- Did you?
- What did I say?

745
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,074
- What did you say?
- I said, "Not actually."

746
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:37,306
Fuck you care, George?
We're just talking.

747
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:38,712
- We are?
- Yes.

748
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:42,150
- Because it's a crime.
- Robbery. That's right.

749
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:45,853
It is a crime.

750
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,360
- It's also very safe.
- You're actually talking about this.

751
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:54,192
- That's right.
- You're going to steal the leads.

752
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:55,697
- Have I said that?
- Are you?

753
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,563
- Did I say that?
- Did you talk to Graff?

754
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,227
- What did I say?
- What did he say?

755
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,100
What did he say?

756
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,401
He'd buy them.

757
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:17,412
You're gonna steal--

758
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,651
you're gonna steal the Glengarry
leads and sell them to Graff?

759
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:23,750
- Yes.
- What's he gonna pay?

760
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:27,092
He figures there's 500 leads,
let's say 10 bucks apiece,

761
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:30,759
- that's $2,500 each.
- Each?

762
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,768
- "Each"?
- That's right, George.

763
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,270
- You're saying me?
- No, you and me.

764
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:39,605
Yeah. That's exactly
what I'm saying. $2,500 apiece.

765
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,975
You and me for one night's work,
and a job with Graff

766
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:44,810
- working the premium leads.
- A job with Graff?

767
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:47,282
- Is that what I said?
- He'd give me a job?

768
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,410
He could take you on.
Yes.

769
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:13,632
Hello?

770
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,111
I was dialing the direct line
to my daughter's room.

771
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,910
Sheldon Levene.
She's in--

772
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:23,544
well, yeah, I'm sure she's asleep.
But-- where's the duty nurse?

773
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:28,155
They canceled her--
well, let me talk--

774
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,216
who am I speaking to?

775
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:36,261
I'll have the money there
tomorrow.

776
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,825
It's a big decision,
George.

777
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:42,269
At times a guy
has got to make one.

778
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,432
It's a big decision
and it's a big reward.

779
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:47,841
$2,500 and a job, it's a big reward
for one night's work.

780
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,004
Yes.

781
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,548
Sometimes a guy...

782
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:54,982
sometimes, a man
if he wants a reward--

783
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:57,612
That's absolutely right.

784
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:59,679
He'll do one thing,
one thing on one night.

785
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:04,319
That's absolutely right.
The thing is, it's got to be tonight.

786
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:05,452
What?

787
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:07,520
What, what?
The leads ain't going to leave?

788
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,793
They bring those leads up,
wave them under your nose,

789
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:12,028
tomorrow they take them downtown,
parcel them out.

790
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,866
A guy wants those leads,
he's gonna have to get them tonight.

791
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,873
Tonight is the thing.
Talk about a chance.

792
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,670
It's when a chance
presents itself.

793
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:21,370
You got to go
in there tonight.

794
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,810
- You.
- I'm sorry?

795
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,575
- You.
- Me?

796
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:26,707
You have to go in.
You have to get the leads.

797
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,218
- I do?
- It's not something for nothing.

798
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:33,052
I took you in on this.
You have to go. It's your thing.

799
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,284
I've made a deal with Graff.
I can't go in.

800
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,624
I've spoken out on this too much.
I've got a big mouth.

801
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:41,721
"The fucking leads," et cetera,
"the tight-ass company," blah, blah.

802
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,734
- They'll know when you go to Graff.
- What will they know?

803
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,066
That I stole the leads ?
I didn't steal the leads.

804
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,901
I'm gonna go to the movies.
Then I'm gonna have a late drink

805
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,134
- at the Como Inn with a friend.
- Dave.

806
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:53,506
Yes ?

807
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:55,670
You want me to break into the office
tonight and steal the leads ?

808
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:57,008
- Yes.
- No.

809
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,672
- Oh, yes, George.
- What does that mean?

810
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:03,209
Listen to this. I have an alibi.
I'm going to the Como Inn.

811
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:06,017
Why? Why?
The place gets robbed,

812
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:08,557
they're going to come looking for me.
Why? Because I probably did it.

813
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:11,059
Let me ask you this--
are you going to turn me in?

814
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:12,959
What if you don't get caught?

815
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,520
They come to you,
are you going to turn me in?

816
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,624
- Why would they come to me?
- They're going to come to everybody.

817
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,463
- Why would I do it?
- You wouldn't, George.

818
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:20,526
That's why I'm talking to you now.
They come to you,

819
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:22,401
- are you going to turn me in?
- No.

820
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:24,133
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

821
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:29,202
Uh-huh. George...
when they come to me,

822
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,941
if I have to go in there,
and if I get caught--

823
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,848
- they come to me...
- You don't have to go in.

824
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:36,783
I have to go in, see?
That's something I have to do.

825
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,913
- Why?
- Why?

826
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,581
Are you going to give me $ 7,500?

827
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:42,887
75? I thought we were
splitting five grand.

828
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,952
I lied, all right? Your end is 25,
my end is my own concern.

829
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,998
Now, stick with me here.
If they come to me,

830
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:51,728
I'm caught, they're going to ask me
who were accomplices.

831
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,463
- Me.
- Absolutely.

832
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,834
That's ridiculous.

833
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,737
To the law, you're
an accessory before the fact.

834
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:59,708
- I didn't ask to be.
- Tough luck, because you are.

835
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:02,404
- Because you told me about it?
- That's right.

836
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:05,004
Why are you doing this
to me, Dave?

837
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:07,710
Why are you talking this way to me?
I don't understand.

838
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:11,015
- Why are you doing this at all?
- None of your fucking business.

839
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:12,988
Just in or out?
You tell me.

840
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,580
You're out,
you take the consequences.

841
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:16,592
- I do?
- That's right.

842
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,628
- And why is that?
- Because you listened.

843
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:20,486
Well, when will
Mrs. Nyborg be back?

844
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:23,158
You know, I hate to keep
calling you this late, Bruce,

845
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:27,363
but I feel a responsibility,
I must say. When you have--

846
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:32,498
You know, they say,
"You don't buy it, you rent it."

847
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,874
- Huh?
- The thing.

848
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:39,848
You really...
what do you keep ?

849
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,715
I mean, you don't keep
anything, really.

850
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:45,550
- No.
- Security.

851
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:48,216
Things. Things.

852
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:50,692
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.

853
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:55,357
It's just... you try
to stave off insecurity.

854
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,831
You can't do it.

855
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,360
- No.
- No. That's what I'm telling you.

856
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:04,703
Stocks, bonds, objects of art,
real estate, what are they?

857
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:08,211
An opportunity.
To what? To make money?

858
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:12,214
Perhaps. To lose money?
Perhaps.

859
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:15,774
To indulge and to learn
about ourselves ? Perhaps.

860
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:18,946
So fucking what?
What is it? They're an opportunity.

861
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:21,957
That's all they are.
They're an event.

862
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:25,688
A guy comes to you,
you make a call. You send in a card,

863
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:28,526
I have these properties
I would like for you to see.

864
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:31,624
What does this mean?
What do you want it to mean?

865
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:33,829
You see what I'm saying?

866
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,873
Things happen to you.

867
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,771
Glad I met you.

868
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:44,541
I'm glad I met you,
James.

869
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:49,311
I want to show you
something.

870
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:51,911
It may mean something to you,
it may not.

871
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,822
I don't know.
I don't know anymore.

872
00:49:57,594 --> 00:50:00,654
What is that?
Florida.

873
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:03,564
Glengarry Highlands.
Florida.

874
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,625
Bullshit.
And maybe that's true.

875
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:09,831
And that's what I said.

876
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:12,431
But look at this.

877
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:16,946
What is this ?
This is a piece of land.

878
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,482
Listen to what I'm going
to tell you now.

879
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,637
- What happened?
- Where do you work?

880
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,307
I work, yes.
I work here.

881
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,816
- What is it? What happened?
- Robbery.

882
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:05,320
Williamson. Williamson,
did they get the contracts ?

883
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:10,398
All right, tell me.
Now. Tell me.

884
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,298
- They stole the contracts ?
- Excuse me, sir.

885
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:13,768
- Did they get my contract?
- Excuse me, fella.

886
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:15,065
- Did they?
- Would you excuse us ?

887
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:17,265
Don't fuck with me, fella.
I'm talking about a Cadillac car

888
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,968
- that you owe me.
- They didn't get your contract.

889
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:22,409
- I filed it before I left.
- They didn't get my contracts ?

890
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:24,413
They got-- excuse me.

891
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:26,506
Fuck.

892
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,347
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Williamson!

893
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,320
- Williamson, open the fucking door.
- Who are you?

894
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,516
- They didn't get the contracts.
- Did they?

895
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,116
They got-- listen to me.
They got some of them.

896
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:39,856
- Some of them?
- Who told you?

897
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:43,263
Who told me?
Who told me we had a robbery?

898
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:44,994
We got a fucking board
up on the window.

899
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:49,528
Who is this ? Yes.
Yes, I confess. I did it.

900
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,904
Now, leave me
a second here, please.

901
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:54,637
- Okay, now, talk to me.
- I'm still trying to sort it out.

902
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:56,872
- So far--
- Talk to me. Talk to me.

903
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:00,212
They got some
of the contracts ?

904
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:03,480
Lingk. James Lingk,
which I closed last night.

905
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:05,214
- You closed it last night?
- Yes.

906
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,951
- I filed it. It went down.
- You filed it?

907
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:11,391
- James Lingk?
- Yes.

908
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,395
- It was sent downtown?
- Yes, all right?

909
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,397
I filed it last night.
It went to the bank.

910
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,831
- It went downtown, all right?
- You filed it?

911
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:20,563
Then I'm over the fucking top,
you owe me a Cadillac.

912
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,832
- I don't--
- I don't want to hear any shit.

913
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:25,875
I don't give a shit.
Lingk puts me over the top.

914
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:28,934
You filed it. It went downtown.
Now you owe me the car.

915
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:31,981
- The robbery makes difficult--
- Fuck you! You owe me the car!

916
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:34,676
See, 'cause this is how
we keep score, "bubby."

917
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:37,914
You told me, "Close thus,
and so you get the car."

918
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,980
- I got it.
- Would you excuse us, please?

919
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:43,992
You hear what I said?
Do you hear what I said?

920
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:47,587
Hey, pal!
Your excuses are your own!

921
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,866
"Recontact James Lingk.

922
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:04,778
6:00 p.m. Morton Grove."
Ah-ha.

923
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:07,339
When do you expect
her in?

924
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:10,147
This is Ricky Roma
from last night.

925
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,314
She'll remember.
Just, just-- wait a minute!

926
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:16,723
Just to say-- to thank her
for a wonderful time.

927
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:19,261
Thank you.
I'll call back later. Thank you.

928
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:21,729
They should check
if we're insured.

929
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:26,729
Uh-huh.

930
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:29,738
"10:00 p.m., Octavia."

931
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:32,832
Please don't leave.
I'm going to talk to you.

932
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:35,776
- What's your name?
- Are you talking to me?

933
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:38,837
- That's right.
- My name is Richard Roma.

934
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:53,322
I-- you know,
they should be insured.

935
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,864
- What do you care?
- Then they wouldn't be so upset.

936
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:58,457
- Huh?
- They wouldn't be so upset.

937
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:01,129
- Mitch and Murray.
- Yeah, you're right.

938
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:03,035
That's right.
How are you?

939
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:05,336
I'm fine.

940
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,876
You mean the board?
You mean on the board?

941
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:12,877
Yes. Okay.
The board.

942
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:15,440
I'm fucked on the board.
I can't--

943
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,348
My mind must be other places,
'cause I can't--

944
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,823
What?
You can't do what?

945
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:25,690
- I can't close them.
- Well, they're old.

946
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:29,425
Look, look at this shit
they're giving you. Huh?

947
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:31,729
- Yes, they are old.
- They're ancient.

948
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:34,269
"Clear Meadows."
This shit's dead.

949
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:35,702
- It is dead.
- Waste of time.

950
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:40,232
- Yes. I'm no fucking good.
- Hey, fuck that shit, George.

951
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,574
You had a bad month.
You're a good man.

952
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:44,409
- I am?
- Yeah, you had a bad streak.

953
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:48,247
Look at this. 15 units, Mountain View,
the fucking things get stolen.

954
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:51,947
- He said he filed--
- He filed the big one.

955
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:54,183
He filed the guy from the bar
that I closed last night.

956
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:56,748
All the little ones,
I got to go back.

957
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:01,759
Can you believe this ?
I got to go back and close again.

958
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:04,425
I mean, talk about
a fucking beat

959
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:08,096
that would sap anyone's-- wait,
wait, wait. Where are the phones ?

960
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:11,004
- They stole--
- They stole...?

961
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:13,599
- What kind of an outfit is it...
- They stole the phones.

962
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:16,441
...when criminals come and they take--
they steal the phones ?

963
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:18,708
They stole the leads.
They stole the phones,

964
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:21,410
they stole-- aw, Christ.

965
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:25,716
What am I going
to do this month? Shit.

966
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:27,757
You think they're going to catch--
where are you going?

967
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,985
Down the street.

968
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:35,990
- Where are you going?
- To the-- what do you fucking care?

969
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:40,503
- Aren't you going out today?
- With what, John? With what?

970
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:43,767
Well, answer me.
They stole the Glengarry leads.

971
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,298
- They stole Rio Rancho.
- I have stuff from last year's file.

972
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:50,608
Oh, oh, oh.
Your "nostalgia" file.

973
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,410
Oh, great. That's great,
'cause I don't...

974
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:55,713
- Do you want to go out today?
- I don't have to eat this month.

975
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:58,379
Great.
Give them to me.

976
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:01,891
Bring them.
Come on.

977
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:06,922
Fucking Mitch and Murray
are going to shit a--

978
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:10,159
What am I going
to do all month?

979
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:12,531
See, the thing
of it is,

980
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:15,070
is were the leads insured?
You think?

981
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:18,073
- What?
- Were the leads insured?

982
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:20,507
I don't know, why?

983
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:22,477
'Cause if they weren't,
I know Mitch and Murray...

984
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,911
- What?
- They'll be upset.

985
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:27,472
That's right.

986
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,745
You're right.

987
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:33,512
He said we're all going
to have to talk to the guy.

988
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:35,148
- To...
- The cop.

989
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,284
Great. We have to talk
to the cop.

990
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:41,023
- Another waste of time.
- A waste of time? Why?

991
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:43,031
Why? 'Cause they're not going
to find the guy.

992
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:46,967
- The cops ?
- Yes, the cops. No.

993
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:48,697
The cops aren't going
to find the guy?

994
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:50,535
- Nope.
- Why do you think so?

995
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:54,131
Why? Because they are stupid.
Where were you last night?

996
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:56,709
- Where were you?
- Where was I?

997
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:57,838
- Yeah.
- I was at home.

998
00:56:57,881 --> 00:56:58,973
- Where were you?
- At home.

999
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:00,913
See? Were you the guy
who broke in?

1000
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:02,042
- Was I?
- Yes.

1001
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:04,313
- No.
- Then don't sweat it. You know why?

1002
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:06,514
- No.
- You have nothing to hide.

1003
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:09,285
- When I talk to police, I get nervous.
- Yes, you know who doesn't?

1004
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,919
- No. Who?
- Thieves.

1005
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:13,963
I don't know
what I'm going to tell them.

1006
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:16,363
The truth.
Always tell them the truth.

1007
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:18,424
It's the easiest thing
to remember.

1008
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:22,028
Whoa, whoa!
"Patel"?

1009
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,573
"Ravidam Patel"?

1010
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:26,438
How am I going to make a living
on these deadbeats ?

1011
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:28,477
- Where did you get this from, a morgue?
- Look, I'm--

1012
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:31,708
Come on. What's the point?
What's the fucking point?

1013
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,648
I got to argue with you,
I got to knock heads with the cops,

1014
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:36,548
I'm busting my balls
to sell your dirt

1015
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,417
to deadbeats--
money in the mattress.

1016
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:41,980
I come back, you can't even
keep the contracts safe.

1017
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:44,253
I got to go out--
fuck this shit.

1018
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:46,124
I'm going to go out
and re-close last week's stuff.

1019
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:48,255
No, the word from Murray
is leave them alone.

1020
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:50,526
If he needs a new sig,
he'll go out himself.

1021
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,569
- Murray's gonna go out?
- He'll be "president of the company

1022
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,968
just in from out of town,"
all right?

1023
00:57:57,507 --> 00:58:00,533
Okay, okay, okay.
Give me this shit.

1024
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:03,044
- I'm giving you three leads.
- Three? I count two.

1025
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:05,342
- There's three leads there.
- Patel? Fuck you.

1026
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:08,441
Fucking Shiva handed
this guy a million dollars,

1027
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:10,748
told him, "Sign the deal,"
he wouldn't sign.

1028
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,584
And the god Vishnu, too,
into the bargain. Fuck you.

1029
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:16,489
You know your business, I know mine.
Your business is being an asshole.

1030
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,153
If I find out whose fucking cousin
you are, I'm gonna go to him

1031
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:23,461
and figure out a way
to have your ass-- fuck you!

1032
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:26,161
I'm waiting
for the new leads.

1033
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:33,735
Get the chalk!
Hey! Get the chalk!

1034
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,675
Get the--
I did it-- I closed 'em.

1035
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:37,508
I closed the cocksucker.
Get the chalk.

1036
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:41,107
Put me on the board, John.
Put me on the Cadillac board!

1037
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,880
Williamson,
pick up the fucking chalk.

1038
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:48,014
- Rick-- eight units, Mountain View.
- You sold eight Mountain View?

1039
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:50,423
You bet your ass!
Who wants to go to lunch?

1040
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:52,620
Who wants to go to lunch--
I'm buying.

1041
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:56,392
Williamson-- $82,000,
12 grand in my commission.

1042
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:58,730
On deadbeat
magazine subscription leads.

1043
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:01,429
- Who?
- Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.

1044
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:03,904
Read it.
What the hell happened here?

1045
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:06,134
Fuck! I had them
on River Glen.

1046
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,972
- What happened?
- Somebody broke in.

1047
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,205
- Eight units!
- Yeah.

1048
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,181
- Shelly!
- Big deal-- I broke a bad streak.

1049
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:15,479
Shelly "The Machine" Levene.
That's great.

1050
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,486
Thank you, George.
Hey--

1051
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,988
- grab the phone, call Mitch.
- They took the phones.

1052
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,648
- Huh?
- Aaronow?

1053
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:23,955
They took the leads,
the cash, the contracts.

1054
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:25,858
- We had a robbery.
- When?

1055
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:28,625
- Last night, this morning.
- They took the leads ?

1056
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:33,425
Fucking asshole.

1057
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,664
What? They beat you
with a rubber bat?

1058
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:38,070
Cop couldn't find his dick
with two hands and a map.

1059
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:40,507
Anybody who talks to this asshole
is a fucking asshole.

1060
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,670
- You gonna turn state's ?
- Fuck you, Ricky.

1061
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:45,612
I ain't going out today.
I'm going home.

1062
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:48,014
I'm going home because nothing's
accomplished here.

1063
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,109
- Anybody talks to this guy--
- Guess what "The Machine" did.

1064
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:53,519
- Fuck "The Machine."
- Mountain View, eight units.

1065
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,684
Cop's got no right to talk to me
that way. I did not rob the place.

1066
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:59,887
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yeah, he closed the deal.

1067
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:02,329
Eight units,
Mountain View.

1068
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:04,923
- You did that?
- Yeah.

1069
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:08,262
- Fuck you.
- Guess who?

1070
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:09,930
- When?
- Just now.

1071
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:12,304
- Guess who?
- You just-- this morning?

1072
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:14,866
Harriett
and blah blah Nyborg.

1073
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:18,175
- You did that?
- Yeah-- $82,000.

1074
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:22,843
- Those fucking deadbeats.
- My ass. I told 'em-- listen to this.

1075
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:26,082
- I don't want to hear your war stories.
- Fuck you, Dave.

1076
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:28,589
I said, "You have to believe
in yourself."

1077
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:31,058
Give me a lead.
I'm going out. I'm getting out.

1078
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:35,962
- Fuck the leads. I'm going home.
- Fuck me, Bruce.

1079
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:37,590
- You have to believe in yourself.
- We haven't got a lead.

1080
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:40,135
- Why not?
- They took 'em.

1081
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:42,797
They're fucking garbage, any case.
The whole goddamn--

1082
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:46,205
"You look around, you say,
'This one has so-and-so. I got nothing.

1083
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:48,766
But why? Why don't I get
the opportunities ?"'

1084
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:51,439
- Did they steal the contracts ?
- What the fuck do you care?

1085
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:53,311
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

1086
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:55,408
Will you shut up ?
I'm telling him something.

1087
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:59,014
Could we get
some coffee?

1088
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:01,249
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

1089
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:04,420
Uh-huh.

1090
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,394
Anybody's going out,
I could use some coffee.

1091
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:12,257
- "You do get the opportunity."
- Fuck is that supposed to mean?

1092
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,633
"You do get the opportunities.
You get 'em as I get 'em,

1093
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:17,436
- as everybody gets 'em."
- I don't care they stole the contracts ?

1094
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,634
I got 'em in the kitchen,
eating their crumb cake--

1095
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:21,939
- What does that mean?
- It means, Dave,

1096
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:24,241
You haven't closed
a good one in a month.

1097
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:26,144
None of my business,
you want to push me to answer you.

1098
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:29,275
So you haven't got a contract
to get stolen and so forth.

1099
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:32,185
You got a mean streak in you.
Shut the fuck up!

1100
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:35,452
Ricky, you got a mean streak in you,
and what are you babbling about?

1101
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,390
You bring that shit up--
on my volume?

1102
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:40,623
If you were on a bad one and I
brought it up to you, you'd harbor it.

1103
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,165
You'd harbor it a long while
and you'd be right.

1104
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:45,598
- Who said "Fuck 'The Machine"'?
- Fuck "The Machine"?

1105
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:48,193
Fuck "The Machine"?
Fuck "The Machine"!

1106
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:51,638
What is this, courtesy class ?
You're fucked, Rick.

1107
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,472
Are you fucking nuts ?
You're hot, so you think

1108
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,136
- you're the ruler of this place.
- Wait a minute, Dave.

1109
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:57,975
- Shut up!
- Okay...

1110
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:00,538
You want to decide who
should be dealt with how, is that it?

1111
01:02:00,616 --> 01:02:03,517
I come into the office today,
I get humiliated by some jag-off cop.

1112
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:05,486
I get accused of--

1113
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:09,218
I get shit thrown in my face because
you're top name on the board?

1114
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:12,159
Is that what I did, Dave--
I humiliated you?

1115
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:15,755
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- Sitting on top of the world.

1116
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:18,699
Sitting on top of the world--
everything's fucking peach fuzz.

1117
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:21,999
I don't get a moment to spare
for some bust-out humanitarian

1118
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:23,868
- down on his luck lately?
- Fuck you!

1119
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,737
Fuck you, Dave--
you know you got a big mouth.

1120
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:29,039
You make a close, this whole place
stinks with your farts for a week--

1121
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:33,446
how much you just ingested.
Oh, what a big man you are!

1122
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:36,212
"Let me buy you a pack of gum--
I'll show you how to chew it."

1123
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:39,254
Your pal closes, and all that comes
out of your mouth is bile.

1124
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:42,485
How fucked-up you are!

1125
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:47,427
Who's my pal, Ricky? Hmm?
And what are you?

1126
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:50,830
What are you, huh,
Bishop Sheen?

1127
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,993
What the fuck are you,
"Mr. Slick"?

1128
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:55,697
What the fuck are you,
"Friend to the working man"?

1129
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,138
Big deal!
Fuck you!

1130
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,707
You got the memory
of a fucking fly!

1131
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,716
I never liked you,
anyway.

1132
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,911
What is this,
your farewell speech?

1133
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:12,386
- I'm going home.
- Your farewell to the troops ?

1134
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,286
I'm not going home.
I'm going to Wisconsin.

1135
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:16,848
- Have a good trip.
- Aw, fuck you!

1136
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:20,358
Fuck the lot of you!
Fuck you all!

1137
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:26,398
You were saying?

1138
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:29,165
Huh?

1139
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:31,069
Come on.

1140
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:33,404
Come on-- you got 'em
in the kitchen,

1141
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:36,104
you're in
your shirtsleeves,

1142
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:38,477
you got
the stats spread out,

1143
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:41,813
you can smell it.
Come on, snap out of it.

1144
01:03:41,884 --> 01:03:45,251
- You're eating her crumb cake.
- Oh yeah, I'm eating her crumb cake.

1145
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:48,449
- How was it?
- From the store.

1146
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:51,084
- Fuck her.
- "Bruce, Harriett...

1147
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:55,028
we have to admit to ourselves
that we see that opportunity

1148
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:58,555
and take it-- and that's it."
Now, we just sit there.

1149
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:00,431
- I got my pen out.
- "Always Be Closing."

1150
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,994
God, that's what
I've been saying-- the old ways.

1151
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:06,599
Convert that motherfucker,
sell him, make him sign the check.

1152
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,541
They got their money
in government bonds--

1153
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:12,206
I said, "Fuck it-- let's go
all the way, the whole route."

1154
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:16,581
I take it and plat it out-- eight units,
82 grand, and I say to them,

1155
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:21,749
"This is now. This is that thing
that you have been dreaming of.

1156
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:24,315
You are going to find
the suitcase on the train.

1157
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:27,624
The man walks in the room,
that bag is filled with money.

1158
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:31,224
Harriett, this is it, and Bruce--
I don't want to fuck around with you.

1159
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:34,497
No, I don't. I don't want
to pussyfoot around.

1160
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:37,801
You think you got to look back
on this thing? I do, too.

1161
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:41,310
Now, I'm here to do good
for you and me-- the both of us.

1162
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:44,676
What is the point
of some interim position?

1163
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:48,342
The only arrangement
I will accept is full investment.

1164
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:51,477
And I mean it, that's it--
all eight units. Period."

1165
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:54,148
Now I got the pen
in my hand, Rick-- hey.

1166
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:59,058
I turned that contract around--
that's eight units, 82 grand--

1167
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:03,189
and I said,
"I want you to sign."

1168
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:06,292
I sat there five minutes.

1169
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:11,773
Then I sat 22 minutes
by that kitchen clock on the wall.

1170
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:14,639
Ricky-- not a word,
not a motion.

1171
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:17,372
And what am I thinking?
"Is my arm getting tired?"

1172
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:20,279
No. I did it.
Just like the old days,

1173
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:21,976
like I used to,
like I was taught.

1174
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:24,144
- I did it.
- Like you taught me.

1175
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:27,280
Nobody ever--
well, if I did, I'm glad.

1176
01:05:27,356 --> 01:05:29,415
No, what I did--
I locked on 'em.

1177
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:32,120
I locked all on them--
nothing on me-- on them.

1178
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:35,288
And, oh God, I am holding
my last thought,

1179
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:38,026
"Now is the time."

1180
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:42,696
They signed.
It was great.

1181
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:45,468
It was so fucking great.

1182
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:49,443
It was like
they wilted all at once.

1183
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:52,140
- Mmm.
- No gesture, nothing-- just together.

1184
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:57,311
Honest to God, they both
imperceptibly slumped.

1185
01:05:57,386 --> 01:06:01,015
And then he reached
and he took the pen and he signed,

1186
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,217
passed it to her
and she signed.

1187
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:05,556
It was solemn--
fucking solemn.

1188
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:10,622
I let it sit, and then I nodded.
I said, "Harriett, Bruce,"

1189
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:13,134
then I pointed into the living room
to the sideboard.

1190
01:06:13,202 --> 01:06:15,432
I didn't know there was
a sideboard in there.

1191
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:17,495
He went over,
he brought us back a drink--

1192
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:21,065
little shot glasses
with a pretty design in 'em.

1193
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:26,307
And we just toasted
in silence.

1194
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:29,840
Great sale, Shelly.

1195
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:31,944
Great.

1196
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:34,956
Fuck! Send me out!
Give me leads!

1197
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:36,048
- Williamson! Send me out!
- Whoa!

1198
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:38,750
- The leads are coming.
- Get 'em to me.

1199
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,456
I talked to Mitch and Murray
an hour ago. They're coming in.

1200
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:44,158
- They're a bit upset over this.
- Did you tell 'em my sale?

1201
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:46,633
How could I tell 'em your sale?
I didn't have a tele--

1202
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:49,034
I'll tell 'em your sale
when they bring in the leads.

1203
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:52,040
We had a little-- you closed the deal,
you made a good sale. Fine.

1204
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:55,009
- Better than a good sale.
- I have a lot of things on my mind.

1205
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:58,274
They're coming and they're very upset.
I'm trying to make--

1206
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:01,111
All I'm telling you is, you can tell
them it was a remarkably good sale.

1207
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:03,913
The only thing remarkable
about it is who you made it to.

1208
01:07:03,986 --> 01:07:07,444
- What the fuck does that mean?
- If the sale sticks it'll be a miracle.

1209
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:09,821
"If the sale sticks"?
Why shouldn't the sale stick?

1210
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:13,919
Oh, fuck you!
You do not know your job.

1211
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:15,827
Do you know that?
A man is his job!

1212
01:07:15,898 --> 01:07:18,890
You are fucked at yours.
You hear what I'm saying to you?

1213
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:21,061
Your "End of the Month"
fucking boar--

1214
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:22,934
you do not know how
to run this office.

1215
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:25,405
You haven't got the sense.
You haven't got the balls.

1216
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:28,637
Have you ever been on a sit?
Has this cocksucker been on a sit?

1217
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:31,441
- Did you ever sit--
- If I were you, I would calm down.

1218
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:33,482
Would you?
What are you gonna do, fire me?

1219
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:35,449
Oh, oh, Rick, ooh.

1220
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:38,783
- It's not impossible.
- Really? On an $80,000 day?

1221
01:07:38,854 --> 01:07:41,322
- It's not even noon yet.
- You closed 'em today?

1222
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:44,052
I got up early this morning,
tracked 'em down, and closed it.

1223
01:07:44,126 --> 01:07:47,425
What I'm saying to you
is that things change.

1224
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:50,863
That's where you fuck up.
You don't know. You can't look back.

1225
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:54,994
You don't see who's coming.
Maybe it's someone new, huh?

1226
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,232
Maybe it's someone else,
but you don't know--

1227
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:59,968
you can't look back, because
you don't know your history!

1228
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:02,408
When we were on Rio Rancho,
who was the top man, huh?

1229
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:04,412
For what,
two months, three months ?

1230
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,449
How about eight months,
for three years in a row!

1231
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:11,282
Luck-- was that it, John?
Or purloined fucking leads ?

1232
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:13,184
- It was talent!
- Yes.

1233
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:16,816
Door to door.
It's called "cold calling," John.

1234
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:20,259
Shit, I don't even know their name.
They don't want to buy what I've got.

1235
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:23,025
Soft sell-- we were doing it
before we had a name for it.

1236
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:24,964
- Am I right?
- You're right, you're right.

1237
01:08:25,034 --> 01:08:28,902
You wouldn't know, you cock--
he doesn't even know what a streak is.

1238
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:31,337
What the hell are you?

1239
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:34,137
You're a fucking secretary.
Fuck you!

1240
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:37,611
That's my message to you--
fuck you, and kiss my ass.

1241
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:41,446
If you don't like that, I go across
the street and speak to Jerry Graff.

1242
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:43,382
Period. Fuck you.

1243
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:46,615
Listen to me-- you put me
on that fucking board,

1244
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:49,157
and I want three
promising leads for today,

1245
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:52,251
I don't want any bullshit,
and I want 'em close together,

1246
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:54,489
because I am
going to close them all.

1247
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:57,794
And that's all I have
to say to you.

1248
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:02,161
He's right, Williamson.

1249
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:08,038
I'm sorry, but it's wrong,
and you know whose fault it is ?

1250
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:09,702
Mitch and Murray.

1251
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:15,012
To hell with him.
Let's get some lunch, huh, Rick?

1252
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:17,245
The leads won't be
up here till later anyway.

1253
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:20,686
You're a client. I just sold you
five waterfront Glengarry Farms.

1254
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:23,554
I do this with my hair,
throw me the cue "Kenilworth."

1255
01:09:23,626 --> 01:09:26,060
- Which is it?
- Kenilworth.

1256
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:28,824
I own the property.
My mother owns the property.

1257
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:30,661
I put her into it.

1258
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:33,930
You look on the plats
when you go home. You'll see...

1259
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:36,733
A-3 through 10,
26 through 30.

1260
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:40,536
- Take your time. If you still feel--
- I won't need more time, Rick.

1261
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:42,702
- I've bought a lot of property.
- I've got to talk to you.

1262
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:45,212
Jim, what are you
doing here?

1263
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:48,512
Jim Lingk,
D. Ray Morton.

1264
01:09:48,584 --> 01:09:51,644
- I'm glad to meet you.
- I put Jim into Black Creek.

1265
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,621
- Are you acquainted with--
- Black Creek? No.

1266
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:56,487
- Ooh, in Florida!
- Yes.

1267
01:09:56,559 --> 01:09:59,722
- I meant to speak to you about that.
- We'll do that this weekend.

1268
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:01,524
My wife suggested
I look into it.

1269
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:04,361
Beautiful rolling land--
I was telling Jim and Jinny.

1270
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:07,834
Ray, I got to tell you something.
You eat in a lot of restaurants ?

1271
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:10,770
I know you do.
Ray is with American Express.

1272
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:12,704
- Can I tell Jim what you do?
- Sure.

1273
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:16,233
Ray is the director of all
European sales and services--

1274
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:19,372
what I'm saying is, you haven't had
a meal until you've tasted--

1275
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:21,245
I was at the Lingks'--

1276
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:23,785
what was that service feature
you were talking about?

1277
01:10:23,852 --> 01:10:25,547
- Which--
- "Home cooking."

1278
01:10:25,621 --> 01:10:28,454
- You had a tag phrase you used?
- "Cooking"...

1279
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:30,151
"Home cook--"
the monthly interview.

1280
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:32,387
- The magazine!
- Yes.

1281
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:34,827
Is that something
I can talk about?

1282
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:38,094
It won't be out until
the February issue, but go ahead.

1283
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:39,828
- Are you sure?
- Go ahead.

1284
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:42,928
Ray was eating at one of his
company men's homes in France.

1285
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:45,064
- The man is French?
- No, but his wife is.

1286
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:46,767
His wife.

1287
01:10:46,842 --> 01:10:49,436
Ray, what time
do you have?

1288
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:52,309
- 12:15.
- I got to get you on the plane.

1289
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:54,178
- Didn't I say the 2:00?
- No, the 1:00.

1290
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:57,185
Remember the 1:00-- that's why
we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.

1291
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,380
You're right, the 1:00--
let's scoot.

1292
01:10:59,455 --> 01:11:01,582
- A pleasure.
- I got to talk to you.

1293
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:04,751
I got to run Ray to the airport.
Let's hustle-- John!

1294
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:08,354
Get on the phone to Pittsburgh,
American Express there, for Mr. Morton.

1295
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:11,729
Tell them he's on the 1:00.
I'll see you.

1296
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,268
Christ, I'm sorry
you came all the way in.

1297
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:17,396
I'm running Ray to the airport.
You wait here and--

1298
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:20,067
no, I can't. I'm meeting your man
at the bank.

1299
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:23,976
I wish you'd have phoned!
Are you and Jinny going to be home?

1300
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:25,479
- I don't know.
- Rick?

1301
01:11:25,547 --> 01:11:27,071
- What?
- Kenilworth?

1302
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:28,878
- I'm sorry?
- Kenilworth.

1303
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,852
Oh, God. Excuse me, Ray--
just a minute.

1304
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:36,448
Jim, I told you who he is-- the senior
vice-president of American Express.

1305
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:38,720
His family owns 32 per--

1306
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:42,696
over the past years, I have sold him--
I can't tell you the dollar amount--

1307
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:45,427
but quite a lot of land.

1308
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:48,959
I promised him five weeks ago that I
would go to the wife's birthday party

1309
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:51,563
in Kenilworth tonight.
I have to go, you understand?

1310
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,734
They treat me like a member
of the family. I have to go.

1311
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:59,008
It's funny-- you get a picture
of the corporation-type company man,

1312
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:01,549
all business--
this guy, I'll tell you.

1313
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:03,551
We'll go to his house
someday.

1314
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:07,783
Let me see. Tomorrow.
I'm in L.A.?

1315
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:10,188
Ah, Monday.

1316
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:12,625
I'll take you to lunch.
Where would you like to eat?

1317
01:12:12,695 --> 01:12:14,128
- My wife--
- Rick?

1318
01:12:14,196 --> 01:12:17,495
I can't talk now, Jim--
I'll call you tonight. Coming, Ray.

1319
01:12:17,566 --> 01:12:19,864
My wife said I have
to cancel the deal.

1320
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:24,130
That's a common reaction, Jim,
and let me tell you what it is.

1321
01:12:24,206 --> 01:12:27,073
That's why you married her.
One of the reasons is prudence.

1322
01:12:27,142 --> 01:12:29,906
No, it's a sizable investment.
One thinks twice.

1323
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:34,915
It's also something women have.
Reaction to the size of the investment.

1324
01:12:35,451 --> 01:12:37,248
Monday, you invite me
to dinner again--

1325
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:39,219
- This woman can cook.
- I'm sure she can.

1326
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:41,984
We are going to talk.
I want to tell you something.

1327
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:45,117
Something about your acreage
I want you to know.

1328
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:48,960
I can't talk about it here,
I really shouldn't, and by law--

1329
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:53,365
the man next to you--
bought his lot at 42--

1330
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:55,460
phoned to say
he already had an offer.

1331
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:57,198
- Rick.
- I'm coming.

1332
01:12:57,272 --> 01:12:59,763
Ray, what a day.
I'll call you this evening.

1333
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:03,141
I'm sorry you had to come
all the way in. Monday lunch.

1334
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,907
- We have to go.
- Monday!

1335
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:08,677
She called the consumer--
the attorney general?

1336
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:11,151
- They said we have three days.
- Who'd she call?

1337
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:14,314
The attorney ge--
it was some consumer office.

1338
01:13:15,457 --> 01:13:17,789
Why'd she do that, Jim?

1339
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:19,691
I don't know.

1340
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:21,593
But they said
we have three days.

1341
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:24,757
They said
we got three days, yeah.

1342
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:26,858
Three days ?

1343
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:30,996
- To... you know.
- No, I don't know.

1344
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:34,600
- Tell me.
- To change our minds.

1345
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:37,611
Of course you have--
three days.

1346
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:40,147
So we can't talk Monday.

1347
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:42,843
Monday--
you saw my book.

1348
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:45,512
Jim, Jim-- I can't.

1349
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:47,452
You saw my book.
I can't.

1350
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:49,582
We have to before Monday
to get our money back.

1351
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:51,683
Three business days,
they mean.

1352
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,194
- Three business days.
- Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

1353
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:57,528
- I don't understand.
- That's what they are, three business--

1354
01:13:57,599 --> 01:13:59,692
if we wait till Monday,
my time limit runs out.

1355
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:01,861
- You don't count Saturday.
- I'm not.

1356
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:04,599
I'm saying you don't include
Saturday in the three days.

1357
01:14:04,673 --> 01:14:08,040
- It's not a business day.
- I am not counting it.

1358
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:12,774
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday--
so it would have elapsed.

1359
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:14,782
What would have elapsed?

1360
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:16,613
If we wait till Monday
it would have elapsed!

1361
01:14:16,685 --> 01:14:18,949
- When did you write the check?
- Yesterday.

1362
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:20,716
- What was yesterday?
- Tuesday.

1363
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:23,883
- And when was that check cashed?
- I don't know.

1364
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:26,325
What was the earliest
it could have been cashed?

1365
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:29,762
- I don't know.
- Today.

1366
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:33,029
Today. Which, in any case,
it was not--

1367
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:36,229
there was something on the agreement
I wanted to go over with you.

1368
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,296
It wasn't cashed?

1369
01:14:38,373 --> 01:14:40,568
I just phoned downtown--
it's on their desk.

1370
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:42,803
- Rick.
- One moment.

1371
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:45,676
One point, in fact, of which
I spoke to you of which,

1372
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:47,772
I can't talk to you
about it here.

1373
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:50,148
- Levene!
- Listen to me.

1374
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:54,212
The statute is for your protection.
I have no complaint with that.

1375
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:56,519
In fact, I was a member
of the board when we drafted it.

1376
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:58,560
So quite the opposite.
It says,

1377
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:01,357
"You can change your mind
three 'working days'

1378
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:03,295
from the time
the deal was closed."

1379
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:05,333
- Levene!
- Wait a second!

1380
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,561
Which is not until
the check is cashed!

1381
01:15:07,636 --> 01:15:11,072
I'm through with this "meshugaas."
Nobody should talk to a man that way.

1382
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:13,437
- How are you talking to me that way?
- Levene!

1383
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:16,444
- How can you talk to me that way?
- I'm gonna flag a cab.

1384
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,413
- I didn't rob--
- Shelly, get in the office.

1385
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:22,609
"Where were you last?"
Is anybody listening to me?

1386
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:26,450
- Where's Moss ?
- Is this Levene?

1387
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:29,423
Perhaps I could assist you.
Excuse us, will you?

1388
01:15:29,491 --> 01:15:32,983
I work here! I didn't come in here
to be mistreated!

1389
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:35,791
- Go to lunch, will you?
- That's why I came in to work today.

1390
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:37,593
The leads come in,
I'll let you know.

1391
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:39,600
- That's why I came in!
- Just go to lunch.

1392
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:41,898
- I don't wanna go to lunch!
- Go to lunch, George.

1393
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:43,904
Where does he get off
talking that way to a working man?

1394
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:46,133
Take it outside. We have people
trying to do business.

1395
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,335
That's what I came in here for.
That's what I'm trying to do!

1396
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:50,935
- I meet Gestapo tactics.
- Excuse me.

1397
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:53,038
I meet Gestapo tactics!

1398
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:55,413
I meet Gestapo tactics.
That's not right.

1399
01:15:55,484 --> 01:16:01,252
No man has the right--
no man has the right--

1400
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:05,419
"Call an attorney"--
that means you're under--

1401
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:07,428
he says, "Cooperate
or we'll take you downtown."

1402
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:09,464
That's not--
as long as I've--

1403
01:16:09,531 --> 01:16:10,998
Will you get out of here?

1404
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:13,797
Will you get out of here?
Will you?

1405
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:16,838
I'm trying to run an office here.
Now, will you go to lunch?

1406
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:21,103
Go to lunch.
Will you go to lunch?

1407
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:36,851
- Excuse me.
- Where did Moss...?

1408
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:40,053
- Excuse me, please?
- Did he go to the restaurant?

1409
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:42,426
Will you
excuse me, please?

1410
01:16:46,068 --> 01:16:48,593
I'm sorry, I--

1411
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:53,372
I apologize to you. It's--

1412
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:56,002
It's not me,
it's my wife.

1413
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,843
What is it?

1414
01:16:59,915 --> 01:17:01,940
- I told you.
- Tell me again.

1415
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:04,918
- What's going on here?
- Tell me again-- your wife?

1416
01:17:04,987 --> 01:17:07,148
- I told you.
- Tell me again.

1417
01:17:07,723 --> 01:17:09,782
She wants her money back.

1418
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:11,621
We're gonna speak to her.

1419
01:17:11,693 --> 01:17:14,218
No, she told me,
"Right now."

1420
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,662
- We're gonna speak to her, Jim.
- She won't listen.

1421
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:18,563
- She--
- Roma!

1422
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:22,161
She said if don't get my money back,
to call the state's attorney.

1423
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:24,034
No. No.
This is something she said.

1424
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:26,506
- We don't have to do that.
- She told me I have to.

1425
01:17:26,575 --> 01:17:28,736
- No, Jim.
- I do.

1426
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,505
Listen, I do--
if I don't get my money back--

1427
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:32,479
Roma,
I'm talking to you.

1428
01:17:32,547 --> 01:17:36,381
Listen-- will someone
get this guy off my back, please?

1429
01:17:36,451 --> 01:17:39,682
- You have a problem?
- Yes, I have a problem!

1430
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:41,279
Yes, I do, my friend.
It is not me

1431
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:44,223
that ripped the joint off.
I'm doing business.

1432
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:47,921
I will be with you
in a while, got it?

1433
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:51,363
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

1434
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:55,660
This is me!

1435
01:17:55,737 --> 01:17:59,503
Jim, this is
Ricky, Jim.

1436
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:04,835
Jim, anything you want,
you want it, you got it.

1437
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:07,381
Understand?
This is me.

1438
01:18:07,449 --> 01:18:09,917
Something upset you.

1439
01:18:09,985 --> 01:18:12,283
Yes.
Sit down now.

1440
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:16,256
Sit down.
You tell me what it is,

1441
01:18:16,324 --> 01:18:19,691
am I gonna
help you fix it?

1442
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:21,820
You're goddamned
right I am.

1443
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:24,422
Sit down.

1444
01:18:24,499 --> 01:18:27,059
I'll tell you something,

1445
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:31,936
sometimes we need
someone from outside.

1446
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:37,504
Sit. Talk to me,
come on.

1447
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:44,379
I can't negotiate.

1448
01:18:45,153 --> 01:18:47,713
What does that mean?

1449
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:51,492
What?

1450
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:55,420
What?
Say the words.

1451
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:58,295
I don't have the power.

1452
01:18:58,366 --> 01:19:00,459
Okay, I said it.

1453
01:19:00,535 --> 01:19:03,936
- What power?
- To negotiate.

1454
01:19:04,005 --> 01:19:05,973
To negotiate what?

1455
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:10,204
To negotiate what?

1456
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:12,109
This.

1457
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:14,273
- What this ?
- The deal.

1458
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:16,249
The deal?

1459
01:19:16,318 --> 01:19:18,309
Forget the deal, Jim.

1460
01:19:18,386 --> 01:19:21,355
You got something on your mind,
what is it?

1461
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:24,085
What?

1462
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:28,726
I can't talk to you.

1463
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:31,265
You met my wife.

1464
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:34,268
- What?
- Aw...

1465
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:38,598
I met your wife,
what?

1466
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:45,042
What, Jim?

1467
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:49,482
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, let's go.

1468
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:50,779
Get a drink,
come on.

1469
01:19:50,852 --> 01:19:53,047
No, no, she told me
not to talk to you.

1470
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:54,986
Come on, we're gonna
go around the corner.

1471
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:56,614
We'll have a drink.
Who's gonna know?

1472
01:19:56,691 --> 01:19:58,716
She told me to get
the check back, otherwise--

1473
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,819
Forget the deal, Jimmy.
Forget the deal.

1474
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:04,388
The deal is dead.
You know me, the deal's dead.

1475
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:06,832
Am I talking
about the deal?

1476
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:09,268
That's over.

1477
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:11,999
Please--
let's talk about you.

1478
01:20:18,613 --> 01:20:21,343
I'm gonna tell you
something.

1479
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:23,748
Your life is your own.

1480
01:20:25,587 --> 01:20:27,782
You have a contract
with your wife,

1481
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:30,882
you have certain things
you do jointly,

1482
01:20:30,959 --> 01:20:34,122
you have a bond there.
And there are other things,

1483
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:40,192
and those things are yours.
You needn't feel ashamed.

1484
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:42,862
You needn't feel
that you're being untrue

1485
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:47,136
or that she would
abandon you if she knew.

1486
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:50,372
This is your life.

1487
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:57,481
Yes ?

1488
01:21:00,088 --> 01:21:03,649
Now, I want to talk to you
because you're obviously upset,

1489
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:06,751
and that concerns me.

1490
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:09,228
Let's go,
come on, right now.

1491
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:11,026
Let's go, come on.

1492
01:21:11,099 --> 01:21:13,363
Roma.

1493
01:21:13,435 --> 01:21:16,165
- What?
- The check, it's--

1494
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:19,801
What did I tell you?

1495
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:21,740
No, what did I tell you
about the three days ?

1496
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,744
Roma, would you?
I'd like to get some lunch.

1497
01:21:24,145 --> 01:21:28,241
I am talking with Mr. Lingk,
if you please.

1498
01:21:28,316 --> 01:21:32,275
I will be with you in a while.
Just check with Mr. Williamson.

1499
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:36,120
- People downtown said--
- Call them again. Mr. Williamson!

1500
01:21:36,191 --> 01:21:38,284
Yes ?

1501
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,385
Mr. Lingk and I
are going to go to the--

1502
01:21:40,462 --> 01:21:43,226
Oh, yes, please.
The police can be--

1503
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:45,892
- What are the police doing here?
- It's nothing.

1504
01:21:45,967 --> 01:21:49,767
- What are the police doing here?
- We had a slight burglary last night.

1505
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:51,999
It's nothing,
I was just assuring Mr. Lingk.

1506
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:54,439
Mr. Lingk? James Lingk?
Your contract went out.

1507
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:56,409
- Nothing to worry about.
- John, John--

1508
01:21:56,478 --> 01:21:58,275
- Your contract went out to the bank.
- You cashed my check?

1509
01:21:58,346 --> 01:22:00,280
- Mr. Williamson--
- The check was cashed.

1510
01:22:00,348 --> 01:22:02,976
The contract was filed
and deposited in the bank,

1511
01:22:03,051 --> 01:22:05,451
and we're completely insured
in any case, as you know.

1512
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:09,616
- You cashed the check?
- Not to my knowledge, no.

1513
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:12,489
- Though I'm sure we can--
- Not to my knowledge.

1514
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:15,859
Christ! I--
Oh, Christ.

1515
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:18,399
Don't follow me,
just don't follow me, okay?

1516
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:23,597
I've let you down.
I know I've let you down.

1517
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:26,937
I'm sorry, forgive me. I-I--

1518
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:31,040
I don't--
I don't know anymore.

1519
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:37,176
I... forgive me.

1520
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:53,796
You stupid fucking cunt.

1521
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:57,297
You, Williamson,
I'm talking to you, shithead.

1522
01:22:57,372 --> 01:23:00,000
You just cost me
$6,000.

1523
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:06,639
$6,000, and one Cadillac.
That's right.

1524
01:23:06,715 --> 01:23:09,081
What are you gonna
do about it?

1525
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:13,678
What are you
gonna do about it, asshole?

1526
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:15,689
You're fucking shit.

1527
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:18,157
Where did you
learn your trade,

1528
01:23:18,226 --> 01:23:21,059
you stupid fucking cunt,
you idiot?

1529
01:23:21,129 --> 01:23:23,563
Who ever told you
that you could work with men?

1530
01:23:23,631 --> 01:23:25,030
Could I...?

1531
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:27,568
Oh, I'm gonna have
your job, shithead.

1532
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:30,365
I'm going downtown.
I'm gonna talk to Mitch and Murray.

1533
01:23:30,438 --> 01:23:34,465
I'm going to Lemkin!
I don't care whose nephew you are,

1534
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:37,568
who you know,
whose dick you're sucking on,

1535
01:23:37,645 --> 01:23:39,977
you're going out.
I swear to you--

1536
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:42,676
Hey, fella,
let's get this done.

1537
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:48,178
Anyone in this office
lives on his wits--

1538
01:23:48,256 --> 01:23:50,986
I'm gonna be with you
in a second.

1539
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:57,358
What you're hired for
is to help us.

1540
01:23:57,432 --> 01:24:00,230
Does that seem
clear to you?

1541
01:24:00,301 --> 01:24:05,170
To help us!
Not to fuck us up!

1542
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:08,403
To help men who are
going out there

1543
01:24:08,476 --> 01:24:11,968
to try to earn a living,
you fairy.

1544
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:13,776
You company man.

1545
01:24:13,848 --> 01:24:16,840
I'll tell you something else,
I hope you ripped the joint off.

1546
01:24:16,918 --> 01:24:20,445
I can tell our friend here something,
might help him to catch you.

1547
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:27,793
You wanna learn
the first rule

1548
01:24:27,862 --> 01:24:30,854
you'd know if you ever
spent a day in your life?

1549
01:24:30,932 --> 01:24:36,302
You never open your mouth
till you know what the shot is.

1550
01:24:38,139 --> 01:24:40,869
You fucking child.

1551
01:24:53,121 --> 01:24:56,215
You are a shithead,
Williamson.

1552
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:01,221
Can't think on your feet,
you ought to keep your mouth closed.

1553
01:25:01,296 --> 01:25:04,459
Can you hear me?
I'm talking to you.

1554
01:25:04,532 --> 01:25:06,363
Yes, I hear you.

1555
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:09,562
Ricky's right. Can't learn in an office,
gotta learn it in the street.

1556
01:25:09,637 --> 01:25:11,832
And you sure can't buy it,
you gotta live it.

1557
01:25:11,906 --> 01:25:13,897
- Mmmm.
- "Mmmm," yeah!

1558
01:25:13,975 --> 01:25:17,240
Precisely.
Because your partner depends--

1559
01:25:17,312 --> 01:25:19,246
I'm talking to you,
trying to tell you something!

1560
01:25:19,314 --> 01:25:20,406
- You are?
- Yeah, I am.

1561
01:25:20,482 --> 01:25:22,916
- What are you trying to tell me?
- What Roma was trying to tell you.

1562
01:25:22,984 --> 01:25:26,317
What I told you a long time ago.
You don't belong in this business.

1563
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:28,651
You might listen to me.
One day you could say,

1564
01:25:28,723 --> 01:25:30,418
"Hey, maybe the guy--"
oh, fuck it.

1565
01:25:30,492 --> 01:25:33,484
Listen to me now.
Your partner depends on you.

1566
01:25:33,561 --> 01:25:36,121
The man who is your partner,
depends on you.

1567
01:25:36,197 --> 01:25:39,166
You go with him
and for him or you're shit!

1568
01:25:39,234 --> 01:25:41,464
You are shit--
you can't exist alone.

1569
01:25:41,536 --> 01:25:43,367
- Excuse me.
- "Excuse you," nothing!

1570
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:46,566
You be as cold as you want.
You just fucked a good man

1571
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:48,700
out of $6,000
and his goddamned bonus

1572
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:50,835
because you didn't
know the shot.

1573
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:53,210
You can do that and you're not
man enough to say it gets you?

1574
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:56,250
I don't know what--
if you can't take something from that,

1575
01:25:56,317 --> 01:25:59,150
then you're-- scum!
You're fucking white bread.

1576
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:02,246
A child would know it,
he's right.

1577
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:05,520
If you're gonna make something up,
be sure that it helps.

1578
01:26:05,593 --> 01:26:08,562
Hmm?
Or keep your mouth shut.

1579
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:11,394
I'm done with you.

1580
01:26:23,978 --> 01:26:25,570
How do you know
I made it up ?

1581
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:27,979
What?

1582
01:26:28,049 --> 01:26:30,984
How do you know
I made it up ?

1583
01:26:31,052 --> 01:26:33,543
What are you
talking about, huh?

1584
01:26:36,224 --> 01:26:39,284
You said, "Don't make something up
unless it's sure to help."

1585
01:26:41,329 --> 01:26:45,959
- How did you know I made it up ?
- What are you talking about?

1586
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:56,005
I told the customer his contract
had gone to the bank.

1587
01:26:56,077 --> 01:26:58,272
Yeah. Well, hadn't it?

1588
01:27:02,016 --> 01:27:03,950
No, it hadn't.

1589
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:08,215
Don't fuck with me.

1590
01:27:08,289 --> 01:27:10,723
Don't fuck with me!
What are you getting at?

1591
01:27:10,792 --> 01:27:13,556
I'm saying this, Shelly...

1592
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:18,726
usually I take
the contracts to the bank,

1593
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,064
last night I didn't.

1594
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:25,598
Last night I stayed home
with my kids.

1595
01:27:27,609 --> 01:27:30,009
How did you know that?

1596
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:36,849
One night in a year,
I left a contract on my desk.

1597
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:39,352
No one knew that but you.

1598
01:27:40,622 --> 01:27:42,385
Now, how did you know that?

1599
01:27:42,457 --> 01:27:46,052
You want to talk to me or you
want to talk to someone else?

1600
01:27:46,127 --> 01:27:47,594
Because this is my job!

1601
01:27:47,662 --> 01:27:51,530
This is my job on the line
and you are gonna talk to me!

1602
01:27:51,599 --> 01:27:54,591
Now how did you know
that contract was on my desk?

1603
01:27:54,669 --> 01:27:57,229
You are so full of shit!

1604
01:27:57,305 --> 01:27:59,637
- You robbed the office.
- Oh, sure, I robbed the office.

1605
01:27:59,707 --> 01:28:01,834
Oh sure! You asshole.

1606
01:28:01,909 --> 01:28:03,740
What did you do
with the leads ?

1607
01:28:03,811 --> 01:28:06,507
You wanna go in there?
I tell him what I know,

1608
01:28:06,581 --> 01:28:09,243
he's gonna dig up something.
You got an alibi last night?

1609
01:28:09,317 --> 01:28:12,718
You better have one!
What did you do with the leads ?

1610
01:28:12,787 --> 01:28:15,950
If you tell me what you did
with the leads, we can talk.

1611
01:28:16,024 --> 01:28:18,356
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

1612
01:28:18,426 --> 01:28:20,792
If you tell me where the leads are,
I won't turn you in.

1613
01:28:20,862 --> 01:28:23,262
If you don't, I'm gonna tell
the cop you stole them.

1614
01:28:23,331 --> 01:28:26,459
Mitch and Murray will see that you
go to jail, believe me, they will!

1615
01:28:26,534 --> 01:28:27,967
Now, where are the leads ?

1616
01:28:28,036 --> 01:28:30,095
I'm walking in that door.
You got five seconds

1617
01:28:30,171 --> 01:28:31,798
- or you are going to jail!
- Go ahead.

1618
01:28:31,873 --> 01:28:34,341
I don't care,
you understand?

1619
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:38,101
Where are the leads ?

1620
01:28:39,514 --> 01:28:41,607
All right.

1621
01:28:43,551 --> 01:28:45,519
I sold them.

1622
01:28:54,495 --> 01:28:56,986
To Jerry Graff.

1623
01:28:57,065 --> 01:28:59,363
How much did you
get for them?

1624
01:28:59,434 --> 01:29:01,299
How much did
you get for them?

1625
01:29:01,369 --> 01:29:03,701
Five.
Five grand.

1626
01:29:03,771 --> 01:29:06,638
- I got half.
- Who got the other half?

1627
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:08,699
Do I have to tell you?

1628
01:29:08,776 --> 01:29:11,301
Moss.

1629
01:29:14,916 --> 01:29:16,975
Well, that was easy,
wasn't it?

1630
01:29:17,051 --> 01:29:19,576
- His idea.
- Was it?

1631
01:29:19,654 --> 01:29:21,884
I think he got
more than five, actually.

1632
01:29:21,956 --> 01:29:25,255
- Uh-huh.
- He told me my cut was 2500.

1633
01:29:25,326 --> 01:29:27,556
Mmm.

1634
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:30,757
Wait a minute.
Okay-- hey, hey, John!

1635
01:29:30,832 --> 01:29:34,029
Wait-- okay, John!
Hey, Johnny.

1636
01:29:34,102 --> 01:29:37,629
Listen.
Come here, come here.

1637
01:29:39,807 --> 01:29:41,536
Eh, John?

1638
01:29:41,609 --> 01:29:43,873
Last night...

1639
01:29:43,945 --> 01:29:46,607
I gotta tell you,
I'm ready to "do the Dutch."

1640
01:29:46,681 --> 01:29:49,616
I'm done. Moss gets me,
"Do this, we'll get well."

1641
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:52,983
Why not? Big fucking deal.
I'm halfway hoping to get caught.

1642
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:57,184
Hey-- put me out of my misery.
It taught me something, John.

1643
01:29:57,258 --> 01:29:59,726
What it taught me--
you gotta get out there!

1644
01:29:59,794 --> 01:30:03,127
I'm not cut out to be a thief,
I'm cut out to be a salesman.

1645
01:30:03,331 --> 01:30:06,027
And I am back.
I got my balls back.

1646
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:10,059
Now... you got a slight
advantage on me.

1647
01:30:10,138 --> 01:30:12,732
But whatever it takes, John,

1648
01:30:12,807 --> 01:30:15,332
to make things right,
we're gonna make it right.

1649
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:18,004
We are going
to make it right.

1650
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:23,213
I want to tell you
something, Shelly.

1651
01:30:23,284 --> 01:30:26,947
- Eh?
- You have a big mouth.

1652
01:30:27,021 --> 01:30:29,546
What?

1653
01:30:29,624 --> 01:30:31,319
You've got a big mouth!

1654
01:30:31,392 --> 01:30:34,122
And now I'm gonna show you
an even bigger one.

1655
01:30:34,195 --> 01:30:36,060
Where are you going?

1656
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:38,860
You can't do that!
You don't want to do that.

1657
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:41,197
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1658
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:46,429
It's $2,500. Go ahead
and take it, take it all.

1659
01:30:46,507 --> 01:30:48,873
No, I don't think so.
I don't think I want your money.

1660
01:30:48,943 --> 01:30:51,844
I think you fucked up my office,
and I think you're going away.

1661
01:30:51,913 --> 01:30:55,849
Are you nuts ?
I'm gonna close for you! Take--

1662
01:30:55,917 --> 01:30:59,353
I'm gonna make this office and be
number one on that board again.

1663
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:01,718
Wait, John.

1664
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:05,281
John-- okay.

1665
01:31:08,095 --> 01:31:12,498
This is what
we're gonna do-- 20%.

1666
01:31:12,567 --> 01:31:15,764
I'm gonna give you 20%
of all my sales.

1667
01:31:15,837 --> 01:31:18,772
20%, as long as I'm
with this firm.

1668
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,865
50.

1669
01:31:20,942 --> 01:31:25,379
- 50% of all my sales.
- What sales ?

1670
01:31:25,446 --> 01:31:27,607
What sales ? My God,
I just closed 82 grand.

1671
01:31:27,682 --> 01:31:30,810
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I'm back! This is just the beginning!

1672
01:31:30,885 --> 01:31:33,353
Just the beginning?
Where have you been, Shelly?

1673
01:31:33,421 --> 01:31:36,390
Bruce and Harriett Nyborg--
do you want to see the memos ?

1674
01:31:36,457 --> 01:31:40,052
They're nuts.
They used to call in every week--

1675
01:31:40,127 --> 01:31:42,652
when I was with Webb--
we were selling Arizona.

1676
01:31:42,730 --> 01:31:44,789
They're nuts.

1677
01:31:44,866 --> 01:31:50,236
Did you see how they were living?
How can you delude yourself?

1678
01:31:50,304 --> 01:31:52,272
- I've got their check.
- Forget it. Frame it.

1679
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:54,535
- It's worthless.
- The check is no good?

1680
01:31:54,609 --> 01:31:56,975
You want to stick around?
I'll pull the memo. I'm busy.

1681
01:31:57,044 --> 01:31:58,944
The check is no good?
They're nuts ?

1682
01:31:59,013 --> 01:32:00,844
You want to call the bank?
I called them.

1683
01:32:00,915 --> 01:32:04,578
I called them four months ago
when we first got the lead.

1684
01:32:04,652 --> 01:32:07,416
The people are insane.

1685
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:12,326
They just like talking
to salesmen.

1686
01:32:17,331 --> 01:32:21,563
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

1687
01:32:24,171 --> 01:32:28,107
- Why?
- Because I don't like you.

1688
01:32:34,882 --> 01:32:36,873
My daughter.

1689
01:32:36,951 --> 01:32:39,146
Fuck you.

1690
01:32:54,302 --> 01:32:56,702
Asshole.

1691
01:32:56,771 --> 01:32:59,934
Guy couldn't find his fucking couch
in the living room.

1692
01:33:02,109 --> 01:33:04,509
What a day.

1693
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:06,570
Whoo...

1694
01:33:06,647 --> 01:33:09,115
I haven't even had
a cup of coffee.

1695
01:33:12,653 --> 01:33:16,316
Jag-off John opens his mouth,
blows my Cadillac.

1696
01:33:18,826 --> 01:33:22,421
I swear,
it's not a world of men.

1697
01:33:24,932 --> 01:33:27,628
It is not
a world of men, "Machine."

1698
01:33:27,702 --> 01:33:30,500
- Huh?
- It's a world of clock-watchers...

1699
01:33:30,571 --> 01:33:33,199
bureaucrats...

1700
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:36,004
officeholders, what it is.

1701
01:33:37,078 --> 01:33:39,376
It's a fucked-up world.

1702
01:33:41,716 --> 01:33:43,684
No adventure to it.

1703
01:33:43,751 --> 01:33:48,017
Dying breed.
Yes, it is.

1704
01:33:49,724 --> 01:33:53,455
We're the members of a dying breed.
That's-- that's--

1705
01:33:53,527 --> 01:33:57,293
that's why we got
to stick together. Shel?

1706
01:33:57,365 --> 01:33:59,731
- Huh?
- I want to talk to you.

1707
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:02,098
I've wanted to talk to you
for some time--

1708
01:34:02,169 --> 01:34:06,071
for a long time, actually.
I said, "The Machine"--

1709
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:09,541
there's a man
I would work with.

1710
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:13,341
There's--" you know,
I never said a word.

1711
01:34:13,414 --> 01:34:16,349
I don't know why I didn't.
I should've, I don't know why.

1712
01:34:16,417 --> 01:34:20,251
And that shit you were slinging
on my guy today--

1713
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:24,485
that was so good.
That-- it--

1714
01:34:24,558 --> 01:34:27,356
excuse me for saying this,
it's not even my place to say it.

1715
01:34:27,428 --> 01:34:29,988
That was admirable.

1716
01:34:30,064 --> 01:34:32,726
It was the old stuff.

1717
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:36,361
Hey, I've been
on a hot streak.

1718
01:34:36,437 --> 01:34:40,168
So what?
Things I can learn from you.

1719
01:34:42,243 --> 01:34:44,438
- You eat today?
- Me?

1720
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:46,002
Yeah.

1721
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:49,447
Want to swing around the Chinks'--
watch me eat, we'll talk?

1722
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:51,849
I think
I'll stay around awhile.

1723
01:34:51,919 --> 01:34:53,887
Hello, Mrs. Schwartz?

1724
01:34:53,954 --> 01:34:56,047
This is Richard Roma
with Premiere Properties.

1725
01:34:56,123 --> 01:34:59,058
You or your accountant requested
information on a land investment

1726
01:34:59,126 --> 01:35:01,720
which would offer you
depreciation and the chance

1727
01:35:01,796 --> 01:35:04,026
of a substantial return
on a small investment.

1728
01:35:04,098 --> 01:35:06,532
I'm in from Florida
just for one day...

1729
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:10,434
- Mr. Levene?
- ...so I only have that one lot left.

1730
01:35:10,504 --> 01:35:12,335
Would you come in here,
please?

1731
01:35:12,406 --> 01:35:14,772
I don't have too much time
and I'm on the midnight plane back,

1732
01:35:14,842 --> 01:35:17,276
so if you or your husband
are truly interested--

1733
01:35:17,344 --> 01:35:19,812
because I can't hold
this parcel past--

1734
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:22,371
Yes ?

1735
01:35:22,450 --> 01:35:25,419
Well, what would be better
for you-- say, 6:00 or 8:00?

1736
01:35:26,821 --> 01:35:30,951
Go ask him. Shel-- we're gonna talk?
I'm going to the Chinks'.

1737
01:35:31,025 --> 01:35:32,959
When you're done, come down.
We're gonna smoke a cigarette.

1738
01:35:33,027 --> 01:35:35,154
- I...
- Get in the room.

1739
01:35:35,229 --> 01:35:39,131
Hey. Hey, easy, pal.
That's "The Machine."

1740
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:42,226
This is Shelly
"The Machine" Levene.

1741
01:35:42,303 --> 01:35:44,669
- Get in the goddamn room.
- Rick, I...

1742
01:35:44,739 --> 01:35:46,900
- I'll meet you at the restaurant.
- Ricky--

1743
01:35:46,974 --> 01:35:48,839
- Ricky can't help you.
- All I want is--

1744
01:35:48,909 --> 01:35:50,968
What do you want?
You want to what?

1745
01:35:51,045 --> 01:35:54,947
- Rick? Rick?
- Hello? Excellent.

1746
01:35:56,383 --> 01:36:01,218
8:00 p.m.
6947 Euclid.

1747
01:36:01,288 --> 01:36:04,018
Not at all--
thank you very much.

1748
01:36:14,702 --> 01:36:17,933
They find the guy
that broke in the office?

1749
01:36:18,005 --> 01:36:21,168
No. I don't know.

1750
01:36:26,013 --> 01:36:28,106
Did the leads
come in yet?

1751
01:36:28,182 --> 01:36:30,650
No.

1752
01:36:38,526 --> 01:36:40,824
Oh God,
I hate this job.

1753
01:36:40,895 --> 01:36:42,988
Anybody wants me,
I'm at the restaurant.

1754
01:36:48,569 --> 01:36:51,367
Hello, Mrs. Delgari?

1755
01:36:51,438 --> 01:36:54,669
Yes-- you requested some information
about Rio Rancho Properties ?

1756
01:36:54,909 --> 01:36:59,608
 Blue skies smiling at me 

1757
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:04,982
 Nothing but blue skies
do I see 

1758
01:37:05,052 --> 01:37:08,078
 In the morning
there's bluebirds 

1759
01:37:08,155 --> 01:37:11,056
 Singing a song 

1760
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:14,060
 Nothing but bluebirds 

1761
01:37:14,128 --> 01:37:17,097
 From now on 

1762
01:37:17,164 --> 01:37:20,258
 I never saw the sun
shining so bright 

1763
01:37:20,334 --> 01:37:23,098
 Never saw things
going so right 

1764
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:26,071
 Noticing the days
hurrying by 

1765
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:29,598
 When you're in love,
my, how they fly 

1766
01:37:29,677 --> 01:37:34,011
 Blue days,
all of them gone 

1767
01:37:34,081 --> 01:37:39,109
 Nothing but blue skies
from now on... 

1768
01:38:24,431 --> 01:38:29,027
 Blue skies
smiling at me 

1769
01:38:29,103 --> 01:38:34,769
 Nothing but blue skies
do I see 

1770
01:38:34,842 --> 01:38:37,208
 In the morning
there's bluebirds 

1771
01:38:37,278 --> 01:38:40,338
 Singing a song 

1772
01:38:40,414 --> 01:38:45,249
 Nothing but, nothing but
bluebirds from now on 

1773
01:38:45,319 --> 01:38:47,719
 Let me tell you
I never saw the sun 

1774
01:38:47,788 --> 01:38:49,346
 Shining so bright 

1775
01:38:49,423 --> 01:38:52,256
 Never saw things
going so right 

1776
01:38:52,326 --> 01:38:55,056
 Noticing the days
hurrying by 

1777
01:38:55,129 --> 01:38:58,155
 When you're in love,
my, how they fly 

1778
01:38:58,232 --> 01:39:02,862
 Blue skies
smiling at me 

1779
01:39:02,937 --> 01:39:08,136
 Nothing but blue skies
do I see 

1780
01:39:08,208 --> 01:39:10,403
 In the morning
there's bluebirds 

1781
01:39:10,477 --> 01:39:13,878
 Singing a song 

1782
01:39:13,948 --> 01:39:18,715
 Nothing but, nothing but
bluebirds from now on 

1783
01:39:18,786 --> 01:39:21,152
 Let me tell you
I never saw the sun 

1784
01:39:21,221 --> 01:39:22,984
 Shining so bright 

1785
01:39:23,057 --> 01:39:25,582
 Never saw things
going so right 

1786
01:39:25,659 --> 01:39:28,560
 Noticing the days
hurrying by 

1787
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:31,257
 When you're in love,
my how they fly 

1788
01:39:31,332 --> 01:39:34,392
 Blue days 

1789
01:39:34,468 --> 01:39:36,902
 All of them,
all of them gone 

1790
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:41,772
 Nothing but blue skies
from now on 

1791
01:39:41,842 --> 01:39:47,303
 Nothing but blue skies
from now on 

1792
01:39:47,381 --> 01:39:53,115
 Nothing but blue skies
from now on 

1793
01:39:53,187 --> 01:39:56,020
 Now on 

1794
01:39:56,090 --> 01:40:04,225
 Nothing but blue skies.
