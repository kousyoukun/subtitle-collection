00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,572
2306, please.

7
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,328
Hello, honey. How are you doing?

8
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,455
Good.

9
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,583
Oh, what did he say?

10
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,710
Uh-huh. Is he still there?

11
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,837
How long ago did he leave?

12
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,338
Uh-huh.

13
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,550
I'm stopping here, then I've got a little meeting. Then I'll...

14
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,719
I would if I could.

15
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,388
As soon as I can. Let me get off and...

16
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,307
Let me get off and I...

17
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,309
I promise you it'll be OK.

18
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,146
MOSS: What a bunch of bullshit.

19
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,398
Waste of a good man's time.

20
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,825
Hi, could I speak to Dr Lewenstein, please?

21
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,494
It's rather important. Could you get him for me?

22
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,664
It's bullshit trying to make a living on these deadbeat leads.

23
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,292
I swear to God, Shel, I'm on a sit today. This...

24
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,838
Hello, Mrs Swaboda. This is Dave Moss. Yeah, we spoke yesterday.

25
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:38,675
Now, on the Rio Rancho Estates we've had a situation just come up.

26
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:43,055
The president of our company is in town just one day and he has certain parcels...

27
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,600
Er, Doctor... Oh, well, could you get?

28
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,853
What do you mean? He's not there? I have to speak to him.

29
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,980
Yes, it is fairly urgent.

30
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,941
Mr Levene.

31
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:57,444
No, I can't be reached. I'll get back to him.

32
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,489
But we have certain parcels, certain choice parcels,

33
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,492
which he's given me a hold on for the next 48 hours.

34
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,453
What's the best time to get you and your husband together?

35
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,997
Say tonight at... at ten?

36
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,083
Or tomorrow at eight?

37
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,001
OK.

38
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,463
OK, what would be the best time to do that?

39
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,551
Look, you sent in the... No... No, listen to me now.

40
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,137
I've got 48 hours to make you a lot of money.

41
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,808
Well, when will he be home?

42
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,186
Fine, I'll call you back in ten minutes.

43
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:36,108
They don't give you the leads, they don't give you the support, they don't give you dick.

44
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,527
Then they're yanking us in on a sales conference.

45
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,196
When did anyone make a dime or learn a goddamn thing?

46
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,907
All it does is some jerk shoots his mouth off.

47
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,617
Yeah.

48
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,413
I swear to God, Shel. I've got half a mind to go across the street.

49
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,457
I've got half a mind to go with you if they'd take me.

50
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,128
Well, you never know. I'm talking to Jerry Graff last week.

51
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,257
I gotta call these deadbeats back.

52
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,427
Baby, I can't make a goddamn dollar with these leads.

53
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:07,180
- You're killing my ass on the street. - I'm sorry you aren't happy here.

54
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,808
That's cute, but you run this office like bullshit.

55
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,519
You're on an override. You make money, we make money.

56
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,772
- I'd like you to make more. - Give me a lead and don't waste my time.

57
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,734
- Sales conference? - The strategy comes from downtown.

58
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,902
Oh, the strategy. The strategy?!

59
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,904
- I think I'll pass. - I wouldn't.

60
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,699
- Why's that? - When you come, then you'll see.

61
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,785
- Shelley. - Yeah?

62
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,912
Are you ready to do or die tonight?

63
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,166
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, John. Always ready, John.

64
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,794
One thing. We were talking about the leads. I understand we got some new ones.

65
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,464
- We're talking about that at the meeting. - We are?

66
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,966
Cos I'm running into a little bit of a snag.

67
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,553
- Yes, I've seen your sales figures. - John, give me a better lead...

68
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:51,016
- That's what we're talking about tonight. - I'm in a personal bind. I could use a leg up.

69
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,268
- After the meeting. - The Glengarry leads...

70
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,853
After the meeting, Shel.

71
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,147
- Hi, Ricky. - Hello, John.

72
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,275
- Wet out there tonight. - Huh?

73
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,737
Wet out there tonight.

74
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,031
Maybe it'll break the heat.

75
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,455
Al, give me a quick J&B, huh? A double.

76
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,499
Cutty.

77
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,128
They say...

78
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,505
LEVENE: Huh?

79
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:25,133
They say it was so hot downtown this afternoon...

80
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:29,846
...grown men on the street corner were going up to cops

81
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,516
begging the cops to shoot them.

82
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:37,062
They say you should not drink alcohol when it's so hot.

83
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,314
Who says that?

84
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,234
Something I read.

85
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,820
For they say it dehydrates you.

86
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,948
They say you should drink water.

87
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:52,411
But I subscribe to the law of contrary public opinion.

88
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:56,581
If everyone thinks one thing, then I say bet the other way.

89
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,793
Added to which, you know they're wrong.

90
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,837
Well, that's what I'm saying.

91
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,635
- Slow tonight. - Huh? Oh, yeah.

92
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,179
I guess everybody's staying home, huh?

93
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:16,393
If my daughter calls, if anybody calls, I'm over at the office. Thanks.

94
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,846
Got a woman in White Plains on the hook.

95
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,307
Five units, Mountain View. What happens?

96
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,851
She... She has to check with her lawyer.

97
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,853
You let her check with her lawyer?

98
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,980
- What could I do? - I don't know.

99
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,232
Shelley. Who's the guy?

100
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,569
Couldn't tell you.

101
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:11,490
I don't like the whole thing. Cos all I need is a lead. They won't give out...

102
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:15,076
Uh-huh. The rich get richer, that's the law of the land.

103
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,370
Who belongs to the BM?

104
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,544
WILLIAMSON: It is 7:30.

105
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,796
So who is that?

106
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,050
WILLIAMSON: And where's Mr Roma?

107
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,761
Well, I'm not a leash, so I don't know, do I?

108
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,598
Let me have your attention for a moment.

109
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,936
Cos you're talking about what? You're talking about...

110
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:45,065
Bitching about a sale you shot. Some son of a bitch don't want to buy land.

111
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,527
Somebody don't want what you're selling. Some broad you're trying to screw.

112
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,738
Let's talk about something important. Are they all here?

113
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,865
- All but one. - I'm going anyway.

114
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,326
Let's talk about something important.

115
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,955
Put that coffee down.

116
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,587
Coffee's for closers only.

117
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,217
You think I'm fucking with you?

118
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,347
I am not fucking with you.

119
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,433
I'm here from downtown.

120
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,561
I'm here from Mitch and Murray.

121
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,021
And I'm here on a mission of mercy.

122
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,944
Your name's Levene?

123
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,946
Yeah.

124
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,865
You call yourself a salesman, you son of a bitch?

125
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,786
- I don't gotta listen to this shit. - You certainly don't, pal.

126
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,913
Cos the good news is you're fired.

127
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:49,254
The bad news is all of you've got just one week to regain your jobs, starting with tonight.

128
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,631
Starting with tonight's sit.

129
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,887
Oh, have I got your attention now?

130
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,975
Good.

131
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,480
Cos we're adding a little something to this month's sales contest.

132
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:12,777
As you know, first prize is a Cadillac Eldorado. Anybody want to see second prize?

133
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,113
Second prize is a set of steak knives.

134
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,327
Third prize is you're fired.

135
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,498
Do you get the picture?

136
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,709
Are you laughing now?

137
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:32,339
You've got leads. Mitch and Murray paid good money.

138
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,799
Get their names to sell them.

139
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:39,429
You can't close the leads you're given, you can't close shit. You are shit!

140
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:43,058
Hit the bricks, pal, and beat it, cos you are going out!

141
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,934
The leads are weak.

142
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,853
The leads are weak?

143
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,272
The fucking leads are weak? You're weak.

144
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,441
I've been in this business 15 years.

145
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,236
- What's your name? - Fuck you! That's my name.

146
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:58,698
You know why, mister? Cos you drove a Hyundai to get here tonight.

147
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,326
I drove an $80,000 BMW.

148
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,578
That's my name.

149
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,877
And your name is, you're wanting.

150
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:14,255
You can't play in the man's game? You can't close them?

151
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,384
Then go home and tell your wife your troubles.

152
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,471
Because only one thing counts in this life.

153
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,308
Get them to sign on the line which is dotted.

154
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,644
You hear me, you fucking faggots?

155
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,821
A... B... C.

156
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,573
A - always, B - be, C - closing.

157
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,701
Always be closing.

158
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:46,037
Always... be... closing.

159
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,040
AIDA.

160
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,668
Attention, interest, decision, action.

161
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,920
Attention - do I have your attention?

162
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,172
Interest - are you interested?

163
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,633
I know you are, cos it's fuck or walk.

164
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,052
You close or you hit the bricks.

165
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,765
Decision - have you made your decision for Christ?!

166
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,892
And action.

167
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,019
AIDA. Get out there.

168
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:14,482
You've got the prospects coming in. You think they came in to get out of the rain?

169
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,360
A guy don't walk on the lot unless he wants to buy.

170
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:22,115
They're sitting out there waiting to give you their money. Are you gonna take it?

171
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,785
Are you man enough to take it?

172
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,169
Incredible.

173
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,296
What's the problem, pal? You - Moss.

174
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,506
You're such a hero, you're so rich.

175
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:42,218
How come you've come here to waste your time with such a bunch of bums?

176
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:51,019
You see this watch?

177
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,437
Yeah.

178
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,774
That watch cost more than your car.

179
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,653
I made $970,000 last year. How much did you make?

180
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:07,327
You see, pal? That's who I am. And you're nothing.

181
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,915
Nice guy? I don't give a shit.

182
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:15,960
Good father? Fuck you. Go home and play with your kids.

183
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,339
You wanna work here? Close!

184
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,717
You think this is abuse?

185
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,221
You think this is abuse, you cocksucker?

186
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:30,183
You can't take this, how can you take the abuse you get on a sit?!

187
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,311
You don't like it? Leave.

188
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:41,736
I can go out there tonight with the materials you got and make myself $15,000.

189
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,780
Tonight! In two hours!

190
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,909
Can you?

191
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,541
Go and do likewise. AIDA.

192
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,960
Get mad, you son of a bitches! Get mad!

193
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,671
You know what it takes to sell real estate?

194
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,968
It takes brass balls to sell real estate.

195
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,433
Go and do likewise, gents.

196
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:16,688
The money's there. You pick it up, it's yours. You don't, I got no sympathy for you.

197
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,775
You wanna go out on those sits tonight and close - CLOSE - it's yours.

198
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,152
Not - you're gonna be shining my shoes.

199
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,283
And you know what you'll be saying, bunch of losers sitting around in the bar?

200
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,869
"Oh, yeah. I used to be a salesman.

201
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,121
It's a tough racket."

202
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,715
These are the new leads.

203
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,093
These are the Glengarry leads.

204
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,512
And to you, they're gold.

205
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,639
And you don't get them.

206
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,099
Why?

207
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,813
Because to give them to you is just throwing them away.

208
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,236
They're for closers.

209
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:15,788
I'd wish you good luck, but you wouldn't know what to do with it if you got it.

210
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,004
And to answer your question, pal... Why am I here?

211
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:28,635
I came here because Mitch and Murray asked me to. They asked me for a favour.

212
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:32,847
I said, "The real favour - follow my advice", and fire your fucking ass.

213
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,099
"Because a loser is a loser."

214
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,359
(Train rumbles)

215
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,780
Bunch of fucking nonsense.

216
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,991
Treat people like that.

217
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:56,079
The fuck is he gonna get off?

218
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,206
Mickey Mouse sales conference.

219
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:02,293
He didn't mean it. I'm sure he didn't mean it about trimming down the sales force.

220
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,711
Where's Roma?

221
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,382
Where the hell's Mr Ricky Roma while we sit here and eat this nonsense?

222
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,677
Hello? Uh, Mr Levene. How's she doing?

223
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,804
Uh-huh. Yeah. Is she awake?

224
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,223
Oh, the doctor came by? What did he say?

225
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,143
Uh-huh. OK, look, I can't come in tonight.

226
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:23,606
Yes, I know she is. I know that she is. I gotta go out.

227
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:28,027
Will you please tell her when she wakes, I've got to go out?

228
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:31,239
And tell her I'll call her from the road. Thank you.

229
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,703
Gentlemen, you heard the man.

230
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,830
MOSS: What is this in aid of?

231
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,416
- As of tonight... MOSS: What is this? Excuse me?

232
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,293
- It's in aid of Mitch and Murray... - Fuck Mitch and Murray!

233
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,672
Fuck 'em! I'm doing my job. I gotta put up with this childishness?

234
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,300
I don't make the rules. I'm paid to run the office. You don't like the rules?

235
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,553
There's the door!

236
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:58,725
Two lead cards for tonight. Two lead cards for tomorrow.

237
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:02,228
As you heard, end of the month, top salesman gets the Eldorado.

238
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,398
- How about the good leads? - The leads I've given you.

239
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,608
These leads are shit. They're old.

240
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:11,029
- I've seen that name a hundred times. - Leads are assigned randomly.

241
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,281
What about the new leads, huh? The new leads.

242
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,366
- The Glengarry leads. - I've got them.

243
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,494
I'm gonna hang on to them. They'll be assigned to closers.

244
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,164
Based on the sales volume, first to Roma.

245
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,416
- Where is Roma? - Don't you worry.

246
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:27,253
- He'll get his leads. - He's top, so he's not here for this shit?

247
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,839
That's correct - and as the hour is waning,

248
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,508
I suggest those of you who are interested

249
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,762
in a continuing job with this organisation get to work.

250
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,847
Garbage. Worked-over bullshit.

251
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:42,351
- Thank you for your attention. - Bullshit! How am I supposed to close these?

252
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:46,981
Look at this. I've had this guy before. I've been to his house twice.

253
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,735
I can't... I... I... I can't close this stuff.

254
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,656
Shelley, how am I supposed to?

255
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,118
They're going to bounce me out of a job.

256
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,503
AARONOW: Hello. Mr Palermo?

257
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,963
I'm sorry.

258
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,966
Mr Speece? Mr Robert Speece?

259
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:20,014
This is George Aaronow. I'm with Rio. I spoke with your wife earlier.

260
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:24,519
Yeah, I'm the Vice President of Rio Rancho Properties in Furman, Arizona...

261
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,854
Yes. I'm calling from the airport

262
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:31,192
and, consulting my map, I see that you and your wife live near the airport.

263
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:36,280
I have some rather unusual, rather good information

264
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:40,868
on the property we've been discussing. - Hello! This is Sheldon Levene.

265
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:44,372
Please listen closely, I only have a moment or so.

266
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,542
I can speak only to a Mrs Nyborg.

267
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:51,587
Oh, this is Mrs Nyborg. Please listen closely, Mrs Nyborg.

268
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:55,508
I'm calling from Consolidated Properties of Arizona.

269
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:59,720
Our computer has chosen you from all of the many thousands who write in

270
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,348
requesting information on our properties.

271
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,809
Now, by federal law, as you probably know,

272
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,853
the prize must be awarded to you,

273
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,648
even if you are not engaged in our land development plan.

274
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:15,778
The only stipulation, of course, is that you and your husband must sign at the same time

275
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,530
for the receipt of your prize.

276
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:22,118
Now, I will be in the area tonight, possibly tomorrow.

277
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:27,165
What do you think might be a convenient time to meet with both you and your husband?

278
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,667
Of course I'll hold.

279
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,766
- Bunch of fucking nonsense, huh? - I can't close 'em.

280
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,560
- Nobody can close 'em. - They're old.

281
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:51,189
They're ancient. A bunch of fucking nonsense. Get some jerk to come in here.

282
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,692
Sometimes I just think... I wonder if I belong in this business.

283
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,528
Send a guy out there, no support, no confidence.

284
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:01,407
Then I say, "Nobody can close 'em." Then I look at Roma.

285
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:05,161
Roma. Fuck Roma. Had a freak couple... You know, a run of luck.

286
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,746
The leads are garbage.

287
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,916
Then I say, "Why give him the good leads? He doesn't need 'em."

288
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,044
- You going out? - Yeah. I have to go out.

289
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,340
- I can't make a sit. - Have you tried?

290
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:20,134
Yeah. Something's... Something's wrong with me.

291
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:24,555
- I don't know what it is. I can't push through. - Get your coat, you're coming with me.

292
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,724
- Something in me. - Forget it.

293
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,685
- I try, I try. - I said forget it. Come on.

294
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,104
I can't close 'em.

295
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:39,654
Life. I swear to God, you know. You work all your life.

296
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:44,825
- Forget it, George. - Fellas... Roma, so on - so gifted.

297
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,662
Gifted, my ass! Guy gets a string of luck.

298
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,830
Oh, no, no. Not.

299
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,999
The thing of it is, money's tight.

300
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:56,087
Times are tight. It don't do no good throwing this fodder at us - "Go out and sell."

301
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:00,216
Threaten a man all you want. You can't whip a dead horse. All this garbage.

302
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:04,053
Sell 10,000, you win a Cadillac. You lose, we're going to fire your ass.

303
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,763
- It's... medieval. - Yes.

304
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,431
- It's wrong. - Yes.

305
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,518
- Yes, it is. And you know who's responsible? - Who?

306
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:14,105
You know who it is. It's Mitch and Murray. It don't have to be this way.

307
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:18,025
Look at Jerry Graff, he's clean. He's doing business for himself.

308
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:22,029
He's got that list with the nurses. See? You see? That's thinking.

309
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,824
Why take 10%? A 10% sales commission?

310
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,244
Why are we giving the rest away? What are we giving 90% for?

311
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,037
For nothing.

312
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:33,958
For some jerk in the office to tell us, "Get out there and close. Win a Cadillac."

313
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,503
Graff goes out and buys. He pays top dollar, you see, for the leads.

314
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,255
That's thinking.

315
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:43,759
Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself - that's what?

316
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,553
That's thinking. Who?

317
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:49,098
Who's got a steady job? Couple of bucks nobody's touched. Who?

318
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:52,601
- Nurses. - Graff buys a fucking list of nurses. One grand.

319
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:56,647
He paid two, I'll eat my hat. Four, five thousand nurses. He's going wild.

320
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,899
- He is? - Yeah, he's doing very well.

321
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,693
I heard they were running cold.

322
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:01,986
- The nurses? - Yeah.

323
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,281
You hear a lot of things. He's doing well. He's doing very well.

324
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:08,784
- With River Oaks? - River Oaks, Brook Farms - all that shit.

325
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:12,705
Somebody told me - you know what he's clearing himself? 14, 15 grand a week.

326
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,957
- Himself? - That's what I'm saying.

327
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,210
Why? He's got the leads. He's got the good leads.

328
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,671
What are we? We're sitting in the shit here.

329
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,507
Why? Cos we've got to go to them to get them, huh?

330
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,469
90% of our sales we're paying to the office for the leads.

331
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,930
There's our leads, the overheads, the phones, there's a lot of stuff.

332
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:34,143
What do you need? A telephone? Some broad to say good morning? Nothing.

333
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,521
It's the leads. The whole thing is the leads. You understand me?

334
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,649
You can't sell to a void. You've got to get a goddamn person.

335
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:44,737
With a lead, you get a person. I'll go and sell. Otherwise, what do they want from my life?

336
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,906
LEVENE: Hello. Uh, Danny?

337
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,033
Danny, it's Shel Levene.

338
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:54,580
Yeah, we spoke last... May. I called you. I was in town from my estate in Rio Rancho...

339
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:59,502
Arizona. I wish we could've gotten together at that time.

340
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:03,381
Danny, that piece of property I had for you has increased in value...

341
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,674
Grace, Grace... what was that figure?

342
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,761
$76,000.

343
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,680
Oh, Danny. I wish you could've been in on it with me.

344
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,558
I'm here overnight, I have to go home tomorrow,

345
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:18,270
and I thought after the interest you showed on the last trip...

346
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,147
Hold it, Grace.

347
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,274
Danny, I know that you're serious,

348
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:26,904
and because of that I am going to shove my appointments around and make sure...

349
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,615
Oh, gee... I wish that... Uh-huh.

350
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,411
All right, Danny. Yeah, all right.

351
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,674
Going out tonight, Shelley?

352
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,597
What is this bullshit with the sales promotion?

353
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:57,476
- It isn't bullshit, it's the way it is. - You're firing the bottom men on the list?

354
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:00,855
That's how it is. I don't make the rules. They come from downtown.

355
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,190
I've got a little bit of a problem here, John.

356
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:06,318
- I'm closing up the office. - Come over and have a drink with me.

357
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,695
I gotta get home.

358
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:11,740
- Do me the courtesy, huh? Five minutes. - I am trying to get home for two hours.

359
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:14,368
I gotta grab an hour with my kids, come back,

360
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,037
see if anyone closed a contract, take it to the bank.

361
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,290
How about one minute? Huh?

362
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,833
What is it?

363
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,918
- I can't close these leads. - Then move on.

364
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,879
Don't jump...

365
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:29,550
Don't jump out of your manager bag, huh? It's just two guys talking. Am I right?

366
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:33,888
We're just talking. You've got the new leads. If you... Just hold on a second.

367
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,640
The Glengarry leads are to be assigned only to closers.

368
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,435
Hold on a second. If you give me the good leads...

369
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,562
- You blew the last good one I gave you. - No.

370
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,772
Hold on a minute, please. I did not blow 'em.

371
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,608
One kicked out, one I closed.

372
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:49,195
- You didn't close it. - Would you listen? I closed that cocksucker.

373
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:53,908
His ex, John, his ex. I didn't even know he was married. The judge invalidated it.

374
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,368
- Shelley... - What was that, John, huh?

375
00:24:56,536 --> 00:25:00,623
Bad luck, that's all it was. I pray in your life you never find that it runs in streaks.

376
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:06,295
That's what it's doing, that's all it does. I pray that it misses you, and that's all I have to say.

377
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:10,257
(Sighs) I've got to eat, Williamson.

378
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,719
Look at the sheets. Look at the sheets.

379
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:17,389
1987, '88, '89. Six months in '89 - who's on top?

380
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:18,766
- Roma. - Under him.

381
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,685
- Moss. - Oh, bullshit. Bullshit, John!

382
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,647
April to September, it's me. It's no fucking Moss.

383
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:28,609
Due respect - he's an order taker. Oh, talk. Ooh, talks a good game.

384
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,736
But go look on the board. It's me.

385
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,781
- Not lately, it isn't. - Not late... Well, lately...

386
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,700
Kiss my ass, lately. You call Murray and you call Mitch.

387
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,411
When we were on Peterson, who bought the new car, huh?

388
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:44,083
Call Mitch. The Seville? Oh, he came in here - "You bought that for me, fella."

389
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,210
And out of what? Hey, look at me!

390
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,754
Out of what? Nothing! Cold calling.

391
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:52,967
You wanna talk about a sale. You are really beginning to burn my ass, kid.

392
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,552
I can't get a lead...

393
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,303
and you...

394
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,390
It was skill, John. It could be working for you.

395
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,433
- You want to throw it away. - It isn't me.

396
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,269
It's not you? I wonder who it is.

397
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:06,689
Who the fuck am I talking to?! Now, look, I need the leads to...

398
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,482
After the contest. After the 30th.

399
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,568
Bullshit after the contest!

400
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,821
If I'm not on the board by the 30th, they'll can my ass.

401
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,369
I need those leads and I need 'em now, or I'm out.

402
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,709
You're gonna miss me.

403
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:31,463
(Mutters) I swear to you, you will miss me.

404
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,257
Let me tell you something, Shelley.

405
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,926
I do what I'm hired to do. You might do the same.

406
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,303
Jesus.

407
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,305
Now, wait a second.

408
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:44,768
I'm hired to watch the leads. To marshal my sales force. I'm given a policy.

409
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,105
- My job is to do that. - You're going to marshal your sales force?

410
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,774
Anybody falls below a certain mark, I'm directed.

411
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,943
I'm not permitted to give them premium leads.

412
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:56,780
How do they rise above that mark? With dreck?

413
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,533
With this toilet paper that you're giving me?

414
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,494
- You give me a premium lead... - Do you know what they cost?

415
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:06,165
Do I know what the premium leads cost? Yeah, I know what they cost.

416
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:10,419
I generated the sufficient dollar revenue to buy them.

417
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,671
But I cannot sell shit!

418
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:17,468
Jesus. I've seen these before. Christ, I saw these back... Homestead.

419
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:22,806
We pitched these cocksuckers Baywater. They couldn't buy a fucking toaster. They're broke.

420
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,642
They're deadbeats.

421
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,770
Hey, just give me some leads don't come out of a phone book, huh?

422
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,147
Give me something hotter and I'll close it.

423
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,108
It's just a streak. I'm gonna turn it around. Hey.

424
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,153
I need your help.

425
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,488
Huh?

426
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,407
I can't do it, Shelley.

427
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,660
(Train rumbles)

428
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,207
Hey, John.

429
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,627
Give you 10%.

430
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,545
- Of what? - My end. What I close.

431
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,382
You give me the premium leads, you're in for 10% of what I close.

432
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,676
- What if you don't close? - I will close.

433
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,761
- What if you don't close? - I will close!

434
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,888
What if you don't? You understand?

435
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:07,851
Then I'm fucked. You think you're the only guy with a family? You see what I'm saying?

436
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,187
I step out and you don't close, then I'm fired.

437
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:14,858
I will close! Now, 10%, John. I can get hot. You know that.

438
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:18,028
- Not lately, you can't. - That's defeatist. Fuck it.

439
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,906
Go with me. Get on my side and let's do something.

440
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:24,326
You want to run this office? You heard what the man said - attack!

441
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:27,454
Let's do something. Huh?

442
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,666
20%.

443
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,044
- All right. - And 50 bucks a lead.

444
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,171
- (Snorts) - No?

445
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,465
Oh... (Chuckles)

446
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,514
Oh, shit.

447
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,059
(Engine fails to start)

448
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,821
Listen, er...

449
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,948
I gotta talk to you.

450
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,452
Permit me to do this a second. I'm older than you.

451
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,372
A man acquires a reputation on the street.

452
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,542
What he does when he's up, what he does at other times.

453
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:17,337
I said 10, you said no. You said 20, I said fine.

454
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,925
Now you want to throw this 50-buck thing in. Now, John, a good deal...

455
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,637
- A deal has got to be one where both parties... - (Engine fails to start)

456
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,265
OK, OK, fine. 20%, 50 bucks a lead. It's done.

457
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,769
Let's go out. We make some money. I've got bills to pay, huh?

458
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:35,647
I want two sits tonight and I want the good leads, the Glengarry leads.

459
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,734
Two. Two, John. Because I am gonna close 'em both.

460
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,361
It's a long road with no turning, pally. Huh?

461
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:43,655
OK. Now, let's go.

462
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:48,744
- I've gotta go back to the office to get 'em. - Go on, let's go, huh?

463
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,913
You see, this is what I was saying, John.

464
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:56,001
All you need is a little boost. You turn the streak around. Right? Good, huh? Huh, good?

465
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,836
What?

466
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,924
- What? - Two leads, 100 bucks.

467
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,051
- Now? - Now, yes. When?

468
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,803
Oh, Christ. Shit, John!

469
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,222
- I wish I could. - You fucking asshole.

470
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,728
I don't have it. I... I... I don't... I'll bring it in the office in the morning.

471
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,314
- I'll be coming in with the sales. - Nope.

472
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,363
I don't fucking believe this. All right, here's...

473
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,366
Er... 20... 30.

474
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:31,411
And... Come on. Jesus. Here's the 30 and I'll bring the rest in tomorrow.

475
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,705
We've gotta do this, huh? For Christ's sake.

476
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,374
No.

477
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,336
My daughter...

478
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,380
I can't do it, Shelley.

479
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,299
I gotta tell you something, fella.

480
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:48,804
It wasn't so long ago I just pick up the phone and I call Murray. I got your job.

481
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:52,933
"Hey, Murray, the kid is burning my ass." "Shelley, he's gone."

482
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,435
You are gone before I'm back from lunch.

483
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,106
Bought him a trip to Bermuda once.

484
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,108
- I've gotta go. - All right, hey.

485
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,151
Give me er...

486
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,446
- I'll take two more of the old leads. - I gave you two today.

487
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,116
Christ, one is a bust-out and the other ain't home.

488
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,451
- Shelley... - I've been on the phone, I know.

489
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:14,621
No more leads today. Two per day. You've got yours.

490
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,749
- All right? - Sure.

491
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,884
We will do that er... other thing.

492
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,097
I left my wallet in my room.

493
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,607
Deadbeats. Deadbeats - all of them.

494
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:45,485
MOSS: My mistake. I shouldn't have took the leads in the first place.

495
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,404
AARONOW: You had to. MOSS: Why?

496
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,530
To get on the...

497
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:52,242
Get on the board. How am I going to get on the board trying to sell a doctor?

498
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,162
Two regular, two chocolate doughnuts. And the same to go.

499
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,916
- And don't ever try to sell an Indian. - I'd never try to sell an Indian.

500
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:02,210
These names come up. You ever get 'em? Patel. You ever get 'em?

501
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,338
I think I had one once.

502
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,465
You had one, you'd know it. Patel.

503
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:11,011
They keep coming up. I don't know - they like to talk to salesmen. They're lonely.

504
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:15,182
They like to feel superior. Never bought a fucking thing. I don't know.

505
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,143
Come down the line. Doctors, lawyers, Indians.

506
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:22,397
Times are tight. It's tight. Pressure's just too great.

507
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,691
A man can't work. All of them.

508
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:30,948
You go in the door - "I gotta close this fucker or I don't eat lunch or win a Cadillac."

509
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,158
We work too hard, George.

510
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,412
Remember when we were...

511
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,540
...when we were selling Glen Ross Farms?

512
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,542
- Ohh. - Didn't we sell a bunch of that?

513
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,919
Yeah, they came in.

514
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,462
- They fucked it up. - They did.

515
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,340
- They killed the goose. And now... - Stuck with this.

516
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,217
- This fucking shit. - This shit.

517
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,510
- It's too... - It is.

518
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,470
- You get a bad month... - You're on a...

519
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,932
- They put you on a board. A contest board. - I... I... I...

520
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,267
- It's not right. - Not right to the customers.

521
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,061
I know. It's... Hey.

522
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:05,315
What did I learn as a kid on Western? You don't sell a guy one car.

523
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,026
You sell him five cars over fifteen years.

524
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,861
- That's right. - Goddamn right.

525
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,905
Guys come in - blah, blah, blah.

526
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:16,576
"I'll go and rob everybody blind and go to Argentina, cos nobody thought of this before."

527
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:20,205
They kill the goose. A fucking man's worked all his life, he's gotta...

528
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,166
- Cower in his boots. - True, his boots. Yes.

529
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,795
Some fucking "Sell 10,000, win steak knives."

530
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,797
- What do you do? - What can you do?

531
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,174
What can you do if you don't have the leads?

532
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,927
If you do not have the goddamn leads.

533
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,972
Mr Spannel? Oh, Sheldon Levene.

534
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,433
I was speaking to your wife earlier.

535
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,268
Come in.

536
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,813
Cats and dogs, huh?

537
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,065
Oh, yes. (Chuckles)

538
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:52,154
Ooh, I see you're interested in fishing.

539
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:56,575
Oh, I fished myself. Many years. Muskie, Wisconsin.

540
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,827
Oh, a beauty.

541
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,706
- Where's the missus? - Out at the PTA.

542
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,042
- Oh... - What was this in reference?

543
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:09,087
I spoke to your wife earlier on the phone. I'm in town with Rio Rancho.

544
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,591
Yes, yes, I'm sorry. She said you had some sort of award...

545
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:16,970
I was speaking to my sales organisation, my representatives in this area.

546
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,514
Now, Mr Spannel...

547
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:22,809
Your name is Larry. Do you mind if I call you Larry? Huh?

548
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:29,232
All right, Larry. We had a consultant and he made me an offer. (Chuckles)

549
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,026
He offered me $230,000

550
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,111
to promote a sales plan, you see.

551
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:37,407
A plan to present our investment opportunities at Rio Rancho to the public.

552
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:44,081
Well, I said, "Hell, let me save you the 230 and pass the savings along to the investor."

553
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:47,375
My people immediately said, "Whoa! How do you do that?

554
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:52,798
How can you present investment opportunities without television, without magazine ads?"

555
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:57,302
I said, "You take something this good, you go to a man has invested in the past.

556
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,680
You go to him direct and offer the money to him. Rebate!

557
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:03,809
And don't give it to this expert."

558
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,853
So you're here to sell me some land?

559
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:11,608
No - I wouldn't try to sell you land. I leave that to the salesmen, you know,

560
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,735
and people who want to own land.

561
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:18,865
I think something has to be fed, watered and painted, you know. But don't invest in it.

562
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,326
And that motto has stood me in good stead.

563
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,328
- Mr... - Just call me Shelley.

564
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,705
I have never been afraid of familiarity.

565
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:29,918
- I'm walking out the door to pick up my wife. - Let's take my car. We'll go together.

566
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,379
I spoke to the little woman on the phone. Can't wait to meet her.

567
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,465
- No, we're going to our relatives. - She didn't mention that.

568
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,343
- I'm sure she forgot. - I'm on a plane to Florida.

569
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:42,889
- I'm sorry if we put you out... - You didn't put me out. I'm just trying to think.

570
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:46,852
You know, that's the only parcel that I've got. You know what I'm gonna do?

571
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:51,189
I'm gonna go to the computer and pull another one and speak to your relatives, too.

572
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,984
- No, no. Nope. - Come on, you're a busy man and so am I.

573
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,987
- Listen... Lis... - My God, I'm giving a gift away!

574
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:01,408
Look. I don't wanna buy land, I don't wanna invest in land. I have nothing.

575
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:06,246
She took the call without my knowledge. I have no business that I wish to transact.

576
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,707
I can't tell you how to handle your wife.

577
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:12,836
My wife filled in a form and we have been plagued for the last year by...

578
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:17,507
- That's the situation I'm trying to alleviate. - No, no. Do you understand?

579
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,261
Thank you, no.

580
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,263
OK.

581
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:38,612
- Roma, man, Roma. He don't care. - He don't care.

582
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:42,032
He's on top of the world. He's got the good leads, good prospects.

583
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,450
Sales, sales.

584
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,285
- Sales contests. - That's what I'm saying.

585
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,329
Times turn hard, they bounce you out.

586
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:52,292
- And if they bounce you with no confidence... - That's what I'm saying to you.

587
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,633
You know, if they get you on a bad beat...

588
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,510
They get you on it, and you gotta go out. Get a new job.

589
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,804
- With no... With no... - With no confidence.

590
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,390
- Yes. - I'll tell you what the hard part is.

591
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,643
Stop thinking like a goddamn slave.

592
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,189
You say, "The Nazis in Europe. If they came in my door, I'd..."

593
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,942
Bullshit, the time is now. What do you do now?

594
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:21,279
Some guy pissing in your face - cocksucker. Wants to break your rice bowl.

595
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:24,824
Mitch and Murray - fuck you. What I say - fuck you.

596
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,869
Sitting on the good leads.

597
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:30,121
George, we're men here.

598
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,375
Yes.

599
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,212
I'll tell you. I'll tell you what the hard part is.

600
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,258
- What? - Starting up. Standing up.

601
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:46,930
Breaking free of this bullshit, this enslavement to some guy because he's got the upper hand.

602
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:52,310
(Sighs) This is the difference. Listen to me, George.

603
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:56,815
Now, Jerry Graff went in business for himself. He said, "I'm going on my own."

604
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,776
And he was free. You understand me?

605
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,614
I'll tell you what somebody should do.

606
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,162
- What? - Somebody should stand up and strike back.

607
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,999
- Somebody should do something to them. - What?

608
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:17,877
Something to pay 'em back. Someone should hurt them - Mitch and Murray.

609
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,754
Someone should hurt them? How?

610
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,215
Someone should hurt them where they live.

611
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,634
- What? - Someone should rob the office.

612
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,761
- Huh! - That's what I'm saying.

613
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:31,433
If we were that kind of guy - to hold up the joint, trash it. It looks like robbery.

614
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,228
We take the fucking leads out of the files and go to Jerry Graff.

615
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:38,690
- We take the fucking Glengarry leads. Huh? - (Chuckles)

616
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,403
Yeah, Mr Nyborg?

617
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:48,158
Ah, Mr Nyborg - Sheldon Levene. I was speaking to your wife earlier. That's right.

618
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,494
I'd like to speak to you about your prize - awarding you your prize.

619
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:56,041
We're coming to the end of our fiscal year. I'd like to get it off the books before...

620
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,668
Yes, the prize for Consolidated Property.

621
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,755
Yes, the information you requested on Rio Rancho.

622
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:07,135
Now, I'm in town only for a couple of... Let me see, I suppose I could swing by tonight.

623
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,764
Oh. When do you think it might be more convenient?

624
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,183
As I said, I could swing by tonight.

625
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,477
Of course, yes, you speak to your wife.

626
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:18,772
Grace! Gonna need a first-class seat.

627
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:23,651
Er... passport, 10,000 in cash - put that with the negotiable papers, if you would.

628
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:26,363
And put me on the telex hook-up with... Yes?

629
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,034
Well, when do you think Mrs Nyborg might be back?

630
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:34,871
All train compartments smell vaguely of shit.

631
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,123
It gets so you don't mind it.

632
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,835
That's the worst thing that I can confess.

633
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,797
You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.

634
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,590
(Chuckles)

635
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:49,677
When you die, you're gonna regret the things you don't do.

636
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:54,724
You think you're queer? I'm gonna tell you something - we're all queer.

637
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,851
You think you're a thief? So what?

638
00:39:57,019 --> 00:40:01,356
You get befuddled by a middle-class morality? Get shot of it. Shut it out.

639
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,110
You cheat on your wife? You did it. Live with it.

640
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,863
Fuck little girls? So be it.

641
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:12,075
There's an absolute morality? Huh? Maybe.

642
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,412
And then what?

643
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,415
If you think there is, go ahead, be that thing.

644
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,918
Bad people go to hell? I don't think so.

645
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,546
You think that? Act that way.

646
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:27,632
A hell exists on earth? Yes.

647
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,677
I won't live in it.

648
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,679
That's me.

649
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,979
Did you ever take a dump made you feel like you slept for 12 hours?

650
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,481
- Did I? - Yes.

651
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,567
(Chuckles) I don't know.

652
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,819
Or a piss?

653
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:55,076
Great meals fade in reflection.

654
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,287
Everything else gains. You know why?

655
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,414
Because it's only food.

656
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,625
The shit we put in us keeps us going. It's only food.

657
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:09,048
The great fucks you may have had. What do you remember about them?

658
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:13,011
- What do I remember? - Yeah.

659
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:17,682
I don't know. For me, I'm saying what it is...

660
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,018
It's probably not the orgasm.

661
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:25,356
Some broad's... forearm on your neck.

662
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,359
Something her eyes did.

663
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,612
There was this sound she made.

664
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,865
Or it's me in the... I'm telling you.

665
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:39,662
I'm in bed the next day and she brought me café au lait, gives me a cigarette.

666
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,458
My balls feel like concrete. Hey?

667
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,629
What I'm saying... What is our life?

668
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:53,092
Our life is looking forward or it's looking back.

669
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,846
That's it. That's our life.

670
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,974
Where's the moment?

671
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,439
And what is it we're so afraid of?

672
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,192
Loss. What else?

673
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,070
The bank closes. We get sick.

674
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,322
My wife died on a plane.

675
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:19,452
The stock market collapsed. What of these things happen?

676
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,163
None of 'em. We worry anyway. Why?

677
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:26,084
What could we get for 'em?

678
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,461
- For 'em? - For the leads.

679
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,588
What could we get for the leads?

680
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:34,092
I don't know. Ten bucks a throw. 15, maybe.

681
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,885
I don't know.

682
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:40,473
For the leads, you're saying? Say somebody took 'em and went to Jerry Graff.

683
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,183
Yeah. How many leads do we have?

684
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:46,521
The Glengarry? The premium leads? I gotta think they've got 500. Say 500 leads.

685
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:50,400
You're saying a fella could take those leads and sell them to Graff?

686
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,902
The leads to Graff, yes. I was saying...

687
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:58,074
Yeah, a guy could take... Like anything else that is negotiable - a guy could sell 'em.

688
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:01,327
- How do you know he'd buy 'em? - Because I worked for him.

689
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:03,621
- You didn't talk to him? - No.

690
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:07,417
- What do you mean? Talk to him about this? - Yeah.

691
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,753
- Are you just talking about this? - We're just speaking about it.

692
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,964
- Speaking about it as an idea? - Yes.

693
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,300
- We're not actually talking about it? - No.

694
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,218
Talking about it as a robbery.

695
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:19,012
As a robbery? No.

696
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,264
(Moss laughs)

697
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:23,516
Well...

698
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:24,809
Hey.

699
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:29,063
So all this... You didn't actually call Graff? You didn't talk to him?

700
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:31,065
- Not actually, no. - You didn't?

701
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,567
No, not actually.

702
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,193
- Did you? - What did I say?

703
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,904
- What did you say? - What the fuck do you care?

704
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,573
- We're just talking. - We are?

705
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,618
- Yes. - Because er... Because it's a crime.

706
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,870
Robbery - that's right.

707
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,123
It is a crime.

708
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,835
It's also very safe.

709
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,713
- You're actually talking about this. - That's right.

710
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,965
- You're gonna steal the leads. - Have I said that?

711
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,508
- Are you? - Did I say that?

712
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,636
- Did you talk to Graff? - What did I say?

713
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,888
- What did he say? - What did he say?

714
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,518
He'd buy 'em.

715
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,030
- You're gonna steal 'em? - (Woman laughs)

716
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,908
You're gonna steal the leads and sell 'em to Graff?

717
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,744
- Yes. - What's he gonna pay?

718
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:29,916
He figures there's 500 leads at, say, ten bucks apiece - that's $2,500 each.

719
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,001
Each?

720
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,045
- Each? - That's right, George.

721
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:37,006
- What are you saying - me? - You and me. Yeah.

722
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,133
That's exactly what I'm saying.

723
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:42,011
$2,500 apiece - you and me for one night's work

724
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,639
and a job with Graff working the premium leads.

725
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,766
- A job with Graff? - Is that what I said?

726
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,686
- He'd give me a job? - He could take you on, yes.

727
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:17,630
Hello... I was dialling the direct line to my daughter's roo...

728
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,675
Sheldon Levene. Yes, she's in twenty-th...

729
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:23,136
Well, yeah, I'm sure she's asleep, but...

730
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:25,346
Well, where's the duty nur...

731
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,473
They cancelled her?

732
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:30,268
Well, then, let me talk... Who am I speaking to?

733
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,232
I'll have the money there tomorrow.

734
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,360
That's a big decision, George.

735
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,613
Times a guy's gotta make one.

736
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:44,991
It's a big decision and it's a big reward.

737
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:48,411
$2,500 and a job. It's a big reward for one night's work.

738
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,832
- Yes. - You know, sometimes a guy...

739
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,419
Sometimes a man, if he wants a reward...

740
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,337
That's absolutely right.

741
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:00,673
To do one thing, one thing on one night.

742
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,800
That's absolutely right.

743
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:06,387
- The thing is that it's gotta be tonight. - What?

744
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,890
What what? The leads ain't gonna leave?

745
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:12,977
They bring the leads, wave 'em under your nose, tomorrow they take 'em downtown.

746
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:16,189
A guy wants those leads, he'll have to go get 'em tonight.

747
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:20,651
Tonight is the thing. Talk about a chance. It's when a chance presents itself.

748
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,862
- So you've gotta go in there tonight? - You.

749
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,572
- I'm sorry? - You.

750
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,449
- Me? - You have to go in.

751
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,493
- You have to get the leads. - I do?

752
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:32,163
It's not something for nothing, George. I took you in on this.

753
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:36,459
You have to go. It's your thing. I've made a deal with Graff. I can't go in.

754
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,503
I've spoken out on this too much.

755
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:41,923
I got a big mouth. "The fucking leads, fucking tight-assed company."

756
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,883
They'll know when you go to Graff.

757
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,427
What will they know? That I stole the leads?

758
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:51,516
I didn't steal the leads. I'm going to a movie. Then I'm going for a drink at the Como Inn.

759
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,643
- Dave. - Yes?

760
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,562
You want me to break into the office and steal the leads?

761
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,980
- Yes. - No.

762
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,649
- Oh, yes. - What does that mean?

763
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:03,903
Listen to this. I have an alibi. I'm going to the Como Inn.

764
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:07,490
Why? Why?! The place gets robbed, they'll come looking for me.

765
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:11,702
Why? Because I probably did it. Let me ask you this - are you gonna turn me in?

766
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:15,164
- What if you don't get caught? - They come to you, will you turn me in?

767
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,500
- Why come to me? - They'll come to everyone.

768
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:21,462
- Why would I do it? - You wouldn't. That's why I'm talking to you.

769
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,339
- Are you gonna turn me in? - No.

770
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,799
- Are you sure? - Yeah.

771
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,926
Uh-huh.

772
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:30,304
George... when they come to me...

773
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:33,975
If I have to go in there and I get caught, they come to me.

774
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:38,062
- You don't have to go in. - I have to go in. That's something I have to do.

775
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,315
- Why? - Why? Are you gonna give me $7,500?

776
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:43,526
I thought we were splitting five grand?

777
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,904
I lied, all right? Your end's 25, my end's my own concern.

778
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,990
Stick with me here, George.

779
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:52,368
They come to me, I'm caught. They're gonna ask who were accomplices.

780
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,453
- Me. - Absolutely.

781
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:57,415
- It's ridiculous. - You're an accessory before the fact.

782
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,418
- I didn't ask to be. - Tough luck, George. You are.

783
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:03,045
- Because you told me about it? - That's right.

784
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:06,132
Why are you doing this to me, Dave?

785
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,676
Why are you talking this way? I don't understand.

786
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:12,013
- Why are you doing this at all? - None of your fucking business, pal.

787
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,141
In or out? You tell me. You're out, you take the consequences.

788
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,267
- I do? - Right.

789
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:19,562
- And why is that? - Because you listened.

790
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,898
Well, when will Mrs Nyborg be back?

791
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:26,485
I hate to keep calling you this late, Bruce, but I feel a responsibility, I must say.

792
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,446
When you have a...

793
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,949
You know...

794
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,577
...they say you don't buy it, you rent it. - Huh?

795
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,495
The thing.

796
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:39,832
You really er... What do you keep?

797
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:43,377
I mean, you don't keep anything really.

798
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:45,796
(Chuckles) No.

799
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:49,175
Security... Things. Things.

800
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,427
- You know? - Mm-hm.

801
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:56,140
It's just... you try to stave off insecurity.

802
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,267
You can't do it.

803
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,645
- No. - No. That's what I'm telling you.

804
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:05,900
Stocks, bonds, objects of art, real estate. What are they?

805
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:08,694
An opportunity. To what? To make money?

806
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,655
Perhaps.

807
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:12,990
To lose money? Perhaps.

808
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:16,744
To indulge and to learn about ourselves? Perhaps.

809
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,746
So fucking what? What is it?

810
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:22,959
They're an opportunity. That's all they are. They're an event.

811
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:26,379
A guy comes to you. You make a call. You send in a card.

812
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:29,548
"I have these properties I would like for you to see."

813
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:33,844
What does this mean? What do you want it to mean? You see what I'm saying?

814
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,392
Things happen to you.

815
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:44,981
Glad I met you. I'm glad I met you, James.

816
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:49,902
I want to show you something.

817
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:55,282
It may mean something to you, it may not. I don't know. I don't know any more.

818
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,330
What is that? Florida.

819
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,874
Glengarry Highlands. Florida.

820
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:06,002
Bullshit.

821
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,671
And maybe that's true,

822
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,798
and that's what I said.

823
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,925
But look at this.

824
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,594
What is this?

825
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:20,558
This is a piece of land. Listen to what I'm gonna tell you now.

826
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:51,172
- What happened? - You. Where do you work?

827
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:54,508
I work... Yes, I work here. What is it? What happened?

828
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:56,302
Robbery.

829
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,602
Williamson. Williamson.

830
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,854
Did they get the contracts?

831
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:12,276
- Tell me. They stole the contracts. - Excuse me, sir.

832
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,111
- Did they get mine? - They...

833
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:15,237
- Fella... - Did they?

834
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:19,033
Don't fuck with me. I'm talking about a fucking Cadillac that you owe me.

835
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:23,454
- They didn't get your contract. I'd filed it. - They didn't get my contracts?

836
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,915
They got... Excuse me.

837
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,666
Fuck!

838
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:30,795
Fuck. Fuck! Fuck! Williamson!

839
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:33,214
- Williamson, open the fucking door. - Who are you?

840
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,883
- They didn't get the contracts. - Did they?

841
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:38,469
Listen to me. Listen to me. They got some of them.

842
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,805
- Some of them? - Who told you?

843
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:45,476
Who told me? Who told me we had a robbery? We got a fucking board up on the win...

844
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,728
Who is this? Yes.

845
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:50,272
Yes, I confess. I did it.

846
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,858
Now, leave me a second here, please.

847
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:56,237
- OK. Now, talk to me. - We're still trying to sort it out.

848
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:59,323
Talk to me, talk to me. They got some of the contracts.

849
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:02,034
- They... - Lingk.

850
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,411
James Lingk, which I closed last night.

851
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,247
- You closed it last night? - Yes.

852
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,582
- I filed it. It went down. - You filed it?

853
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,669
- James Lingk. - Yes.

854
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,337
It was sent downtown?

855
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:17,216
Yes, all right? I filed it last night. It went to the bank, it went downtown.

856
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:21,137
You filed it, then I'm over the fucking top. You owe me a Cadillac.

857
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:24,306
- I don't think... - I don't wanna hear any fucking shit.

858
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:27,518
I don't give a shit. Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it.

859
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,645
It went downtown, now you owe me the car.

860
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:33,524
- The robbery makes difficult... - Fuck you, you owe me the car! See?

861
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,693
Cos this is how we keep score, Bubby.

862
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:39,613
You told me close thus and so you get the car. I got it.

863
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:41,490
Would you excuse us, please?

864
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:45,619
You hear what I said? Do you hear what I said?! Hey, pal!

865
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:48,497
Your excuses are your own.

866
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,923
(Dials phone)

867
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:04,722
(Reads) Recontact James Lingk. Haircut, 6pm Morton Grove...

868
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:08,058
Uh-huh. Yeah, well, when do you expect her in?

869
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:10,561
This is Ricky Roma from last night.

870
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:14,023
She'll remember me. Just... Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

871
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:17,193
Just to say... To thank her for a wonderful time.

872
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,070
Thank you. I'll call back later. Thank you.

873
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:21,906
They should check if we're insured.

874
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,494
Uh-huh.

875
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,331
10pm... Batavia.

876
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,291
DETECTIVE: Please don't leave.

877
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,376
I'm going to talk to you. What's your name?

878
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,545
Are you talking to me?

879
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:39,131
- That's right. - My name is Richard Roma.

880
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,938
I... You know... They should be insured.

881
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,147
What do you care?

882
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,775
- Well, then they wouldn't be so upset. - Uh-huh?

883
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:03,906
- They wouldn't be so upset... Mitch and Murray. - Yeah, you're right. That's right. How are you?

884
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,532
I'm fine.

885
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,953
What, you mean the board? You mean on the board?

886
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:12,915
I... Yes, OK. The board.

887
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:16,835
I'm fucked on the board. I can't... I can't...

888
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:21,173
See, I can... My mind must be other places, cos I can't...

889
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:23,634
What? You can't do what?

890
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,594
I can't close 'em.

891
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:29,932
Well, they're old. Look, look. Look at this shit they're giving you. Huh?

892
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,267
- Yes. - Huh?

893
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,060
- They are old. - They're ancient.

894
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,980
- Clear Meadows. This shit's dead. - It is dead.

895
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:37,481
- Waste of time. - Yes.

896
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:41,068
- I'm no fucking good. - Hey! Fuck that shit, George.

897
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:43,988
- You had a bad month. You're a good man. - I am?

898
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,531
Yeah. You had a bad streak...

899
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:49,076
Look at this. 15 units, Mountain View - fucking things get stole.

900
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,537
- He said he filed... - He filed the big one.

901
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:54,790
He filed the guy from the bar. That I closed last night.

902
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,209
All the little ones... I gotta go back.

903
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:02,756
Ah... can you believe this? I gotta go back and close again.

904
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:06,844
I mean, talk about a fucking beat that would sap anyone's self-c...

905
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,054
Wait, wait. Where are the phones?

906
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:11,557
- They stole 'em. - They stole...

907
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,268
- What kind of outfit is it... - They stole the phones.

908
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:17,104
...when criminals come and they steal the phones?!

909
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:20,524
They stole the leads, they stole the phones, they stole...

910
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,651
Oh, Christ.

911
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,778
What am I going to do this month?

912
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:26,530
Shit.

913
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,615
You think they... Where are you going?

914
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,993
Down the street.

915
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,120
Where are you going?

916
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:36,707
To the restaurant. What do you fucking care?

917
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,876
Aren't you going out today?

918
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:41,337
With what, John? With what?

919
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:46,467
Well, answer me. They stole the Glengarry leads. They stole Rio Rancho.

920
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:51,680
- I have the stuff from last year's file. - Oh, oh, oh. Your nostalgia file. Oh!

921
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:55,684
- Great. That's great, cos, you know... - Do you want to go out today?

922
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,561
...I don't have to eat this month.

923
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,313
Great. Give 'em to me.

924
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:02,900
Bring 'em. Come on.

925
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:07,738
Fucking Mitch and Murray are gonna shit a brick.

926
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:10,908
What am I going to do all month?

927
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,077
The thing of it is, is, you know...

928
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,454
Were the leads insured? Do you think?

929
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:17,289
What?

930
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:20,542
- Were the leads insured? - I don't know, George. Why?

931
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,045
Cos if they weren't, I know Mitch and Murray...

932
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,297
- What? - They'll be upset.

933
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,425
That's right.

934
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:30,677
You're right.

935
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,765
- He said we all have to talk to the guy. - To...

936
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:37,726
- The cop. - Great. We've got to talk to the cop.

937
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,895
Another waste of time.

938
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,855
A waste of time? Why?

939
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:44,691
Why? Because they're not gonna find the guy.

940
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:47,069
- The cops? - Yes, the cops.

941
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,488
- No. - The cops aren't gonna find the guy?

942
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,240
- Nope. - Why do you think so?

943
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:54,993
Why? Because they're stupid. Where were you last night?

944
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,537
Where were you?

945
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:57,746
- Where was I? - Yeah.

946
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,582
- I was at home. Where were you? - At home.

947
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,709
- Were you the guy who broke in? - Was I?

948
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:05,087
- No. - Then don't sweat it, George. You know why?

949
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,797
- No. - You have nothing to hide.

950
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,882
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.

951
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,384
You know who doesn't?

952
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:11,510
- No, who? - Thieves.

953
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:14,847
But I don't know what I'm gonna tell 'em.

954
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:18,308
The truth. Always tell them the truth. Easiest thing to remember.

955
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,728
Oh-oh-oh... Patel?

956
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:25,065
Ravidam Patel?

957
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:28,444
How do I make a living on these deadbeats? Where'd you get this, the morgue?

958
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:31,196
- Look, I'm... - Oh, come on! What's the point?

959
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:35,701
What's the fucking point? I gotta argue with you? I gotta knock heads with the cops?

960
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:39,997
I'm busting my balls to sell your dirt to deadbeats. Money in the mattress.

961
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:44,626
I come back, you can't even keep the contracts safe. I gotta go out... Fuck this shit.

962
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:49,131
- I'm gonna go and reclose last week's stuff. - No. The word from Murray is leave them.

963
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,634
- He needs a new sig, he'll go out himself. - Murray is gonna go out?

964
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:57,222
He'll be the president of the company, just come in from out of town. All right?

965
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:02,269
- OK, OK, OK. Give me this shit. - There's three leads.

966
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,313
- Three? I count two. - There's three.

967
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,273
Patel? Fuck you.

968
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:11,612
Fucking Shiva handed this guy a million dollars, told him, "Sign the deal", he wouldn't.

969
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:14,031
And the god Vishnu, too. Fuck you, John!

970
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:17,201
You know your business, I know mine. Yours is being an asshole.

971
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:22,539
I find out whose fucking cousin you are, I'll go to him and figure out a way to have your ass.

972
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:24,208
Fuck you!

973
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,376
I'm waiting for the new leads.

974
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:35,052
Get the chalk! Hey, get the chalk! Get the ch...

975
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:40,432
I did it! I closed him. I closed the cocksucker. Get the chalk, put me on the board, John.

976
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,476
Put me on the Cadillac board, huh?

977
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:45,145
Williamson?! Hey, pick up the fucking chalk!

978
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,272
Rick, eight units, Mountain View.

979
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,107
You sold eight Mountain View?

980
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:51,568
You bet your ass. Who wants to go to lunch?

981
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:54,571
Who wants to go to lunch? I'm buying. Hey, Williamson.

982
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:55,906
$82,000.

983
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,533
12 grand in my commission.

984
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,994
- On deadbeat magazine subscription leads. AARONOW: Who?

985
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:03,914
Bruce and Harriet Nyborg. Read it.

986
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:07,167
- What the hell happened? ROMA: Fuck! I had them on River Glen.

987
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,545
- What happened? WILLIAMSON: Somebody broke in.

988
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:12,089
ROMA: Eight units! - Wh... Yeah!

989
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,508
- Shelley! - Ah, big deal. I broke a bad streak.

990
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:17,010
Shelley "The Machine" Levene! That's great.

991
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:19,763
Thank you, George. Hey, grab the phone. Call Mitch.

992
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:21,848
- They took the phones. - Aaronow.

993
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:24,977
They took the leads, took the cash, took the contracts.

994
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:27,729
AARONOW: We had a robbery. - Last night, this morning.

995
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,606
They took the leads?

996
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:36,655
- Fucking asshole. - What? He beat you with a rubber bat?

997
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:41,243
Cop couldn't find his dick with a map. Anybody talks to this asshole's a fucking asshole.

998
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,954
- You gonna turn state's? - Fuck you, Ricky.

999
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:47,791
I ain't going out today, I'm going home. Nothing's accomplished here.

1000
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:51,003
- Anybody talks to this guy... - Guess what The Machine did.

1001
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:54,464
- Fuck The Machine. - Mountain View, eight units.

1002
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:56,508
Cop's got no right to talk to me that way.

1003
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:59,553
- I did not rob the place. - Did you hear what I said?

1004
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:03,015
- Yeah, he closed a deal. - Eight units, Mountain View.

1005
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:05,892
- You did that? - Yeah.

1006
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:08,854
- Fuck you. ROMA: Guess who.

1007
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,897
- When? - Just now.

1008
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:13,233
- Guess who. - You... Just this morning?

1009
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:15,861
Harriet and blah-blah Nyborg.

1010
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:19,031
- You did that? - Yeah. $82,000.

1011
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:21,700
Those fucking deadbeats.

1012
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,244
My ass. I told 'em. Listen to this.

1013
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:27,039
- I don't wanna hear fucking war stories. - Fuck you, Dave.

1014
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:29,583
I said, "You have to believe in yourself."

1015
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:32,294
Give me a lead. I'm going out, I'm getting out.

1016
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,630
Oh, fuck the leads. I'm going home.

1017
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:38,550
LEVENE: "Fuck me, Bruce. Believe in..." - We haven't got a lead.

1018
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,094
- Why not? - They took 'em.

1019
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:42,804
They're fucking garbage.

1020
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:46,391
- The whole goddamn... - "You say this one has so-and-so.

1021
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:50,812
- I got nothing. Why don't I get opportunities?" - Did they steal the contracts?

1022
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,981
- Fuck you care. - "Harriet, I'll tell you."

1023
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:56,443
- Fuck's that supposed to mean? - Shut up. I'm telling him something.

1024
01:00:58,529 --> 01:00:59,988
Can we get some coffee?

1025
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,199
- How are you doing? - Fine.

1026
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:05,077
Uh-huh.

1027
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:08,121
If anybody's going out, I could use some coffee.

1028
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:12,000
"You do get the opportunity."

1029
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:15,420
- Fuck is that supposed to mean? - You do get the opportunities.

1030
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:17,964
Ricky, that I don't care they stole the contracts?

1031
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:21,093
- We're in the kitchen eating crumb cake. - What does that mean?

1032
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:24,346
It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month.

1033
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,099
None of my business. You wanna push me to answer you.

1034
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:30,227
So you haven't got a contract to get stolen, and so forth.

1035
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:32,312
- You got a mean streak, Ricky. - Let me...

1036
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,274
Shut the fuck up. You got a mean streak. And what the fuck are you babbling about?

1037
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:38,360
You bring that shit up, of my volume?

1038
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:43,198
If you were on a bad one and I brought it up to you, you'd harbour it a long, long while.

1039
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,117
Who said "Fuck The Machine"?

1040
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:47,911
Fuck The Machine? Fuck The Machine?

1041
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,538
Fuck The Machine!

1042
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,624
What is this - courtesy class? You're fucked, Rick.

1043
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:56,878
Are you fucking nuts? You're hot so you think you're the ruler of this place.

1044
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,213
- Hey... - Shut up!

1045
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:01,299
You want to decide who should be dealt with how, is that it?

1046
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:04,469
I come to the fucking office, get humiliated by some jagoff cop.

1047
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:08,348
I get accused of... I get the shit thrown in my face by you, you genuine shit,

1048
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,225
because you're top name on the board!

1049
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:14,980
Is that what I did, Dave? I humiliated you. Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

1050
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:19,651
Sitting on top of the world. Sitting on top of the world. Everything's fucking peach fuzz.

1051
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:24,072
And I don't get a moment to spare for some bust-out humanitarian, down on his luck.

1052
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,742
- Oh, fuck you. - Fuck you. You know you got a big mouth.

1053
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:32,164
You make a close, this whole place stinks with your farts for a week. How much you ingested.

1054
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:34,374
Ohh, what a big man you are!

1055
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:36,001
Let me buy you a pack of gum.

1056
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:37,627
I'll show you how to chew it. Ooh.

1057
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:43,842
Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile. Eugh! How fucked up you are.

1058
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:47,220
Who's my pal, Ricky? Hm?

1059
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:49,347
What are you?

1060
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:51,933
And what are you, Ricky, huh? Bishop Sheen?

1061
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:56,605
What the fuck are you, Mr Slick? What the fuck are you, friend to the working man?

1062
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,149
Big deal! Fuck you!

1063
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,570
You got the memory of a fucking fly!

1064
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:08,700
I never liked you anyway.

1065
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,577
Is this your farewell speech?

1066
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:13,330
- I'm going home. - Your farewell to the troops?

1067
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:16,249
- No, not home, I'm going to Wisconsin. - Have a good trip.

1068
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:18,418
Oh, fuck you!

1069
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:20,796
Fuck the lot of you! Fuck you all!

1070
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:27,260
You were saying?

1071
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:28,804
Huh?

1072
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:32,641
Come on.

1073
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,768
Come on, you got 'em in the kitchen.

1074
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:39,022
You're in your shirtsleeves. You got the stats spread out.

1075
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:42,776
You can smell it. Come on, snap out of it.

1076
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:44,694
You're eating her crumb cake.

1077
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:47,280
- Yeah. I'm eating crumb cake. - How was it?

1078
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:50,367
- From the store. - Fuck her.

1079
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:54,162
"Bruce, Harriet, what we have to do is admit to ourselves

1080
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:57,958
that we see that opportunity and take it - and that's it."

1081
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:01,419
- Now, we just sit there. I got my pen out. - Always be closing.

1082
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:04,297
God, that's what I've been saying. The old ways, right?

1083
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:07,676
Convert that motherfucker. Sell him, make him sign the cheque.

1084
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:13,515
Their money's in government bonds. I said to myself, "Fuck it. Let's go all the way, huh?"

1085
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:16,935
I take it and plat it out. Eight units, 82 grand.

1086
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:19,396
And I say to them, "This is now.

1087
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:22,440
This is that thing that you have been dreaming of.

1088
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:25,110
You are gonna find the suitcase on the train.

1089
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:28,655
The man walks in the room, that bag is filled with money.

1090
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:34,077
Harriet, this is it. And, Bruce, I don't want to fuck around with you. No, I don't.

1091
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:38,790
I don't want to pussyfoot around, huh? You think you gotta look back on this? I do too.

1092
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:42,377
I'm here to do good for you and me. The both of us.

1093
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:45,297
What is the point of some interim position?

1094
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:50,510
The only arrangement that I will accept is full investment, and I mean it. That's it.

1095
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:52,470
All eight units, period."

1096
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:55,140
I got the pen in my hand, Rick.

1097
01:04:55,308 --> 01:05:00,228
Hey, I turned that contract around. That's eight units. 82 grand.

1098
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:03,565
And I said, "Now, I want you to sign."

1099
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:07,444
I sat there five minutes.

1100
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:12,908
And then I sat... 22 minutes by that kitchen clock on the wall.

1101
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,327
Ricky, not a word, not a motion.

1102
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:18,371
And what am I thinking? Is my arm getting tired? No.

1103
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:23,668
I did it! Just like the old days, like I used to. Like I was taught. I did it!

1104
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:25,420
- Like you taught me. - No.

1105
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:28,131
Hey, no, nobody ever... Well, if I did, I'm glad.

1106
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:29,966
No, what I did, I locked on 'em.

1107
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:32,969
I locked all on them. Nothing on me, on them.

1108
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:37,807
And, oh, God, I am holding my last thought - "Now is the time."

1109
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:43,313
They signed. Ah, that was great.

1110
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:46,566
It was... It was so fucking great.

1111
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:50,195
It was like they wilted all at once.

1112
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:53,281
- (Chuckles) - No gesture, nothing. Just together.

1113
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,075
- Honest to God. - (Chuckles)

1114
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:58,536
They both kind of imperceptibly slumped.

1115
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:02,290
Then he reached, he took the pen, and he signed.

1116
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:04,417
Passed it to her and she signed.

1117
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:06,544
It was solemn, fucking solemn.

1118
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:08,630
I let it sit, you know.

1119
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,341
And then I nodded. I said, "Harriet, Bruce."

1120
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:14,010
Then I pointed into the living room, to the sideboard.

1121
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:18,932
I didn't know there was a fucking sideboard. He went over. He brought us back a drink.

1122
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,602
Little shot glasses with a pretty design in the little...

1123
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:26,356
And we just toasted in silence.

1124
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:31,611
Great sale, Shelley. Great.

1125
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:36,908
Ooh, fuck. Fuck! Hand me out. Come on! Give me leads. Williamson!

1126
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:39,119
- Send me out! - The leads are coming.

1127
01:06:39,286 --> 01:06:41,246
I talked to Mitch and Murray an hour ago.

1128
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:44,874
- They're coming in. They're a bit upset. - Did you tell 'em my sale?

1129
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:50,005
How could I? I didn't have a tele... I'll tell them your sale when they bring in the leads.

1130
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:53,049
We had a little... You closed the deal, you made a good sale.

1131
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:56,094
- Better than a good sale. - I have a lot of things on my mind.

1132
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:58,805
They're coming in, they're upset. I'm trying to...

1133
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,975
All I'm telling you is you can tell them it was a remarkable sale.

1134
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:06,187
- The remarkable thing is who you made it to. - What the fuck does that mean?

1135
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:08,481
If the sale sticks, it'll be a miracle.

1136
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:11,776
If the... Why shouldn't the sale st? Oh, fuck you!

1137
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,613
That's... You do not know your job, you know that?

1138
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:19,784
A man is his job. You are fucked at yours. You hear what I'm saying to you?

1139
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:21,911
Your end-of-the-month fucking board.

1140
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:26,124
You do not know how to run this office. You haven't got the sense or the balls.

1141
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:29,627
Have you ever been on a sit? Has this cocksucker ever been on a sit?

1142
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:32,380
- Ever sit with a customer? - If I were you, I'd calm down.

1143
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:34,716
Oh, my God, what are you going to do, fire me?

1144
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,634
- (Roma laughs) - Ooh, Rick. Ooh!

1145
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:39,846
- It's not impossible. - Oh, really? On an $80,000 day?

1146
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:42,307
- It's not even noon yet. - You closed today?

1147
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:45,060
Oh, I got up early, I tracked him down and I closed it.

1148
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:48,438
What I'm saying to you, is that things change.

1149
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:51,775
That's where you fuck up because you don't know. You can't look back.

1150
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:53,943
You don't see who's coming.

1151
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:57,781
Maybe it's someone new, huh? Maybe it's someone else. But you don't know.

1152
01:07:57,948 --> 01:08:00,241
You can't look back - you don't know your history.

1153
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:03,369
When we were on Rio Rancho, who was the top man?

1154
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:05,622
For what? Two months? Three months?

1155
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:08,750
How about eight months for three years in a row, huh?

1156
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:13,213
And on what? Luck? Was that it, John? On purloined fucking leads? It was talent.

1157
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,548
- Yes. - Door to door.

1158
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:17,717
It's called cold calling, John.

1159
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:21,971
Shit, I don't know their name, they don't want to buy what I've got. Soft sell.

1160
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:25,850
- Shit, we did it before we had a name for it. ROMA: You're right, Shel.

1161
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:29,854
You wouldn't know, you... (Laughs) He doesn't even know what a streak is.

1162
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:32,232
What the hell are you?

1163
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:35,026
You're a fucking secretary. Fuck you!

1164
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:38,613
Yeah, that's my message to you. Fuck you and kiss my ass.

1165
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:41,241
If you don't like that, baby, I go across the street

1166
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:44,369
and I speak to Jerry Graff. Period. Fuck you.

1167
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:50,083
Now, listen to me. You put me on that fucking board and I want three promising leads today.

1168
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:53,586
I don't want any bullshit about them and I want them close together,

1169
01:08:53,754 --> 01:08:55,797
because I am gonna close them all.

1170
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,716
And that's all I have to say to you.

1171
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:02,137
He's right, Williamson.

1172
01:09:06,433 --> 01:09:10,728
LEVENE: I'm sorry, but it's wrong. And you know whose fault it is? Mitch and Murray.

1173
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:15,233
Ah, to hell with him. Let's get some lunch, huh, Rick?

1174
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:17,861
The leads won't be up here till later anyway.

1175
01:09:18,028 --> 01:09:21,781
You're a client. I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry farms.

1176
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:24,325
I do this with my hair - throw me the cue Kenilworth.

1177
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:26,452
- Which is it? - Kenilworth.

1178
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:31,541
I... I own the property. My mother owns the property. I put her into it.

1179
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:34,836
You look on the plats when you go home. You'll see.

1180
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,672
A-3 through 10. 26 through 30.

1181
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,384
- Take your time. If you still feel... - Oh, I won't need more time, Rick.

1182
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:43,595
- I've bought a lot of property. - Can we talk?

1183
01:09:43,762 --> 01:09:46,264
Jim! What are you doing here?

1184
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:49,017
Jim Lingk, er... D Ray Morton.

1185
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:52,645
- I'm glad to meet you. - I just put Jim into Black Creek.

1186
01:09:52,813 --> 01:09:55,940
- Are you acquainted with er? - Black Creek? No.

1187
01:09:56,108 --> 01:09:57,442
- Oh, in Florida! - Yes.

1188
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:00,528
- I meant to speak to you about that. - We'll do it this weekend.

1189
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:03,698
- My wife suggested I look into it. - Beautiful rolling land.

1190
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:07,577
I was telling Jim and Jinny. Ray, I gotta tell you something. Ray.

1191
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:09,913
You eat in a lot of restaurants, I know you do.

1192
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,623
Ray is with American Express.

1193
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:13,583
- Can I tell Jim what you do? - Sure.

1194
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:17,003
Ray is director of all European sales and services for...

1195
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:20,256
What I'm saying is you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...

1196
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:24,177
I was at the Lingks'... What was that service feature you talked about?

1197
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:26,429
- Which? - "Home Cooking." What did?

1198
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:28,389
- Er... - You had a tag phrase you used.

1199
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:30,099
- Cooking... - Home Cook...

1200
01:10:30,267 --> 01:10:32,101
- The monthly interview. - The magazine.

1201
01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:33,853
- Yes. - Oh, well, I...

1202
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:35,772
Is that something I can talk about?

1203
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:39,192
Well, it won't be out until the February issue, but go ahead.

1204
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,777
- Are you sure? - Go ahead.

1205
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:44,530
Ray was eating at one of his company men's homes in France. The man is French.

1206
01:10:44,698 --> 01:10:45,990
No, but his wife is.

1207
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:47,867
Ah, his wife...

1208
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:50,245
Ray... what time do you have?

1209
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:53,248
- 12:15. - I gotta get you on a plane.

1210
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:55,166
- Oh, didn't I say the two? - No.

1211
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:57,961
One o'clock. That's why we can't talk till Kenilworth.

1212
01:10:58,128 --> 01:11:01,089
Ooh, you're right, the one - let's scoot. A pleasure.

1213
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:04,384
- Uh... I gotta talk to you. - I gotta run Ray to the airport.

1214
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:09,389
Let's hustle. John! Get on the phone to Pittsburgh, American Express - for Mr Morton.

1215
01:11:09,556 --> 01:11:11,391
Tell them he's on the one o'clock.

1216
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:15,270
I'll see you. Oh, Christ, I'm sorry. You came all the way in.

1217
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:18,898
I'm running Ray to the airport. You wait here and I'll... No.

1218
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:21,317
I can't. I'm meeting your man at the back.

1219
01:11:21,485 --> 01:11:23,194
- I wish you'd phoned. - Well...

1220
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:25,863
- Wait. Are you and Jinny home tonight? - I don't know.

1221
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:26,948
LEVENE: Rick? - What?

1222
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,199
- Kenilworth. - Sorry?

1223
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:29,325
Kenilworth.

1224
01:11:29,493 --> 01:11:31,911
Oh, God. Excuse me, Ray, just a minute...

1225
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:37,959
Jim, I told you who he is. He's the Senior Vice President of American Express.

1226
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:39,919
His family owns 32...

1227
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:45,550
Over the past years I have sold him... I can't tell you the dollar amount, but quite a lot of land.

1228
01:11:46,927 --> 01:11:51,597
I promised him five weeks ago that I'd go to the wife's birthday party in Kenilworth tonight.

1229
01:11:51,765 --> 01:11:55,893
I have to go. You understand? I have to... They treat me like family. I have to go.

1230
01:11:56,061 --> 01:12:00,898
It's funny, you get a picture of a corporation-type company man, all business.

1231
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:04,736
This guy... I tell you... We'll go to his house someday.

1232
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:07,071
Let me see... Tomorrow...

1233
01:12:07,239 --> 01:12:09,324
I'm in LA. Uh...

1234
01:12:10,534 --> 01:12:13,578
Monday. I'll take you to lunch. Where would you like to eat?

1235
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:15,246
- My wife said... LEVENE: Rick...

1236
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:18,333
I can't talk now. I'll call you tonight. Sorry. Coming, Ray.

1237
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,043
My wife said to cancel the deal.

1238
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:26,674
It's a common reaction, Jim. Let me tell you what it is. That's why you married her.

1239
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:30,887
One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizeable investment. One thinks twice.

1240
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:33,264
It's also something women have.

1241
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:36,517
Reaction to the size of the investment.

1242
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:39,228
Monday - invite me to dinner again... She can cook.

1243
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:41,606
- I'm sure she can. - We're gonna talk.

1244
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:44,692
I wanna tell you something. Something about your acreage

1245
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,069
I want you to know.

1246
01:12:46,236 --> 01:12:48,905
I can't talk about it here. I really shouldn't.

1247
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:50,615
And by law I c...

1248
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:56,412
The man next to you bought his lot at 42, phoned to say he already had an offer.

1249
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:57,747
Rick.

1250
01:12:57,915 --> 01:13:00,625
I'm coming, Ray. What a day. I'll call you this evening.

1251
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:04,045
I'm sorry you had to come all the way in. I'm sorry. Monday lunch.

1252
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:05,838
- We really have to go. - Monday.

1253
01:13:06,006 --> 01:13:08,049
She called the Consumer... The Attorney...

1254
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:12,136
- The Attorney General? We have three days. - Who'd she call?

1255
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:14,931
The Attorney G... It was some consumer office.

1256
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:18,726
Why'd she do that, Jim?

1257
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:22,647
I don't know. No, but they said we have three days.

1258
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,485
- They said we've got three days. - Three days.

1259
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:29,070
Three. You know...

1260
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:32,907
No, I don't know. Tell me.

1261
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:38,538
- Well, to change our minds. - Of course you have. Three days.

1262
01:13:38,705 --> 01:13:41,124
Well, so we can't talk Monday.

1263
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:43,209
Monday. You saw my book.

1264
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:45,336
Jim, Jim...

1265
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:48,339
I can't. You saw my book. I can't.

1266
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:50,466
We have to to get our money back.

1267
01:13:50,634 --> 01:13:53,803
Three business days, they mean. Three business days.

1268
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:56,973
- Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. - I don't understand.

1269
01:13:57,141 --> 01:14:00,685
They're the three business... We wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.

1270
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:02,854
- You don't count Saturday. - I'm not.

1271
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:06,566
No, you don't include Saturday in three days. It's not a business day.

1272
01:14:06,733 --> 01:14:09,193
I am not counting it.

1273
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:13,739
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday - so it would have elapsed.

1274
01:14:13,907 --> 01:14:17,577
- What would have elapsed? - If we wait till Monday, it would have elapsed!

1275
01:14:17,744 --> 01:14:19,912
- When did you write the cheque? - Yesterday.

1276
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,706
- What was yesterday? - Tuesday.

1277
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:24,876
- And when was that cheque cashed? - I don't know.

1278
01:14:25,043 --> 01:14:27,253
What's the earliest it could've been cashed?

1279
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:29,213
I don't know.

1280
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:31,716
Today? Today?

1281
01:14:32,759 --> 01:14:37,221
Which it was not, as there was something on the agreement I wanted to go over with you.

1282
01:14:37,389 --> 01:14:39,223
It wasn't cashed?

1283
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:42,393
- I just phoned downtown. It's on their desk. - Rick...

1284
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:45,188
One moment. One point, in fact,

1285
01:14:45,355 --> 01:14:47,273
of which I spoke to you, of which...

1286
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:49,525
- I can't talk about it here. DETECTIVE: Levene.

1287
01:14:49,693 --> 01:14:51,068
LINGK: Listen...

1288
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:55,072
Listen. The statute is for your protection. I have no complaint with that.

1289
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:59,035
In fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it - so quite the opposite.

1290
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:02,497
You can change your mind three working days

1291
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:05,249
- from the time the deal was closed. - Levene.

1292
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:09,962
- Wait! That's not until the cheque is cashed. AARONOW: I'm through with this meshugas.

1293
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:13,674
Nobody should talk to me that way. How are you talking to me that way?

1294
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:16,135
DETECTIVE: Levene. - How can you talk to me that way?

1295
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:18,179
LEVENE: I'll flag a cab. - I didn't rob.

1296
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,515
Shelley... Shelley, get in the office.

1297
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:23,601
Where were you last... Is anybody listening to me?

1298
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:26,896
- Where's Moss? Where, where? - Levene. Is this Levene?

1299
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:30,233
Perhaps I could assist you in that. Excuse us, will you?

1300
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,943
Come in here... I work here.

1301
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:34,987
- I didn't come in here to be mistreated. - Go to lunch.

1302
01:15:35,155 --> 01:15:36,739
I... I... came in to work today.

1303
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:39,492
- If the leads come in, I'll tell you. - That's why I'm here!

1304
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,285
- Go to lunch. - I don't wanna go!

1305
01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:42,537
Go to lunch, George.

1306
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:46,791
- Where does he get off? I'm a working man! - Go outside. People are trying to do business.

1307
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:50,753
That's what I came in for. It's what I'm trying to do.

1308
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:52,672
- I meet Gestapo tactics! - Excuse me.

1309
01:15:52,839 --> 01:15:54,465
I meet Gestapo tactics!

1310
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:57,051
I meet Gestapo tactics. That's not right.

1311
01:15:58,095 --> 01:16:00,388
No man has the right...

1312
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,056
No man has the right to...

1313
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:05,393
"Call an attorney" means you're guilt... You're under sus...

1314
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:08,813
Cooperate. He says, "Cooperate or we'll take you downtown!"

1315
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:10,856
That's not... As long as I've...

1316
01:16:11,024 --> 01:16:14,318
Will you get out of here? Will you get out of here? Will you?

1317
01:16:14,486 --> 01:16:17,697
I'm trying to run an office here. Now, will you go to lunch?

1318
01:16:17,864 --> 01:16:19,448
Go to lunch.

1319
01:16:19,616 --> 01:16:21,659
Will you go to lunch?!

1320
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:38,217
- Will you excuse me? - Where did Moss?

1321
01:16:38,385 --> 01:16:41,137
- Excuse me, please. - Did he go to the restaurant?

1322
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:43,389
Will you excuse me, please?

1323
01:16:47,352 --> 01:16:49,437
I'm sorry, I...

1324
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:54,025
I apologise to you. It's um...

1325
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:57,194
It's not me, it's my wife.

1326
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:01,324
- What is it? - Well, I told you.

1327
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:03,618
- Tell me again. - What's going on here?

1328
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:05,745
Tell me again. Your wife.

1329
01:17:05,912 --> 01:17:07,997
- I told you, she... - Tell me again.

1330
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:11,000
Well, she wants her money back.

1331
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:13,002
Well, we're going to speak to her.

1332
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:14,879
No. No, she told me, "Right now."

1333
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:18,090
- We're going to speak to her, Jim. - No, she won't listen.

1334
01:17:18,258 --> 01:17:19,467
Roma.

1335
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,594
She said if I don't get my money back,

1336
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:25,306
- I have to call the State's attorney. - No, this is something she said.

1337
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:27,600
- We don't have to do that. - No, she said I have to.

1338
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:29,935
- No, Jim. - I do. I do... Listen, I do.

1339
01:17:30,103 --> 01:17:32,897
- If I don't get my money back... - Roma. I'm talking to you.

1340
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:34,023
Listen...

1341
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:37,318
Will someone get this guy off my back, please?

1342
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:38,694
You have a problem?

1343
01:17:38,862 --> 01:17:41,155
Yes, I have a problem. Yes, I do, my friend.

1344
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:44,033
It is not me that ripped the joint off.

1345
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:47,662
I'm doing business. I will be with you in a while. You got it?

1346
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:52,500
Where are you going? Where are you going?

1347
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:57,129
This is me... Jim.

1348
01:17:58,173 --> 01:18:00,257
This is Ricky, Jim.

1349
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:06,055
Anything you want. You want it, you got it. You understand?

1350
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:09,225
This is me.

1351
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:11,477
Something upset you. Yes.

1352
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:14,480
Sit down, now. Sit down.

1353
01:18:15,565 --> 01:18:17,650
You tell me what it is.

1354
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,653
Am I gonna help you fix it?

1355
01:18:20,821 --> 01:18:22,988
You're goddamn right, I am. Sit down.

1356
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:28,327
Tell you something.

1357
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:31,789
Sometimes we need someone from outside.

1358
01:18:36,169 --> 01:18:38,045
Sit. Talk to me. Come on.

1359
01:18:41,758 --> 01:18:43,843
I can't negotiate.

1360
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:48,472
- What does that mean? - Well, I...

1361
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:53,018
- What? - (Sighs)

1362
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:56,772
What? Say the words.

1363
01:18:57,816 --> 01:18:59,734
I don't have the power.

1364
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:01,402
OK? I said it.

1365
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,070
What power?

1366
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:04,822
To negotiate.

1367
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:11,078
To negotiate what?

1368
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:12,997
This.

1369
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:15,166
- What this? - The deal.

1370
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:17,126
- The deal? - (Sighs)

1371
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:19,086
Forget the deal, Jim.

1372
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:21,672
You got something on your mind. What is it?

1373
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:25,134
What?

1374
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:28,846
I can't talk to you.

1375
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:30,681
You met my wife. I...

1376
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:33,559
What?

1377
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:35,227
Oh...

1378
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:39,106
I met your wife, what?

1379
01:19:41,985 --> 01:19:43,569
(Sighs)

1380
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:45,821
What, Jim?

1381
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:49,366
Come on, let's go. Come on.

1382
01:19:49,534 --> 01:19:51,911
Let's go. Let's go get a drink. Come on.

1383
01:19:52,078 --> 01:19:54,038
No... she told me not to talk to you.

1384
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:57,374
We're going round the corner for a drink. Who's going to know?

1385
01:19:57,542 --> 01:20:03,047
- She told me to get the cheque or I have to... - Forget the deal, Jimmy. The deal is dead.

1386
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:06,842
You know me. The deal's dead. Am I talking about the deal?

1387
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:09,136
That's over.

1388
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:12,598
Please, let's talk about you.

1389
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:21,857
I'm gonna tell you something.

1390
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:24,735
Your life is your own.

1391
01:20:26,571 --> 01:20:30,658
You have a contract with your wife, you have certain things you do jointly.

1392
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:32,910
You have a bond there.

1393
01:20:33,745 --> 01:20:37,206
And there are other things, and those things are yours.

1394
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:40,876
And you needn't feel ashamed.

1395
01:20:41,044 --> 01:20:43,712
You needn't feel that you're being untrue

1396
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:46,799
or that she would abandon you if she knew.

1397
01:20:48,134 --> 01:20:50,886
This is your life.

1398
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,394
Yes?

1399
01:21:01,064 --> 01:21:04,525
Now, I wanna talk to you because you're obviously upset...

1400
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,777
- No... - And that concerns me.

1401
01:21:07,779 --> 01:21:10,072
Now, let's go. Come on. Right now.

1402
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,241
Let's go. Come on.

1403
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:13,784
DETECTIVE: Roma. - What?

1404
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:15,327
- Uh... - What?

1405
01:21:15,495 --> 01:21:17,121
The cheque, it's...

1406
01:21:18,748 --> 01:21:22,418
What did I tell you? No, look. What did I tell you about the three days?

1407
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:24,545
DETECTIVE: Roma, I'd like to get lunch.

1408
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:28,924
Er... I am talking with Mr Lingk. If you please.

1409
01:21:29,092 --> 01:21:33,178
I will be with you... in a while. Just check with Mr Williamson.

1410
01:21:33,346 --> 01:21:37,016
- People downtown said to check... - Call them again. Mr Williamson.

1411
01:21:37,183 --> 01:21:38,309
Yes?

1412
01:21:39,352 --> 01:21:41,270
Mr Lingk and I are gonna go to the...

1413
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:44,607
Oh, yes, please. The police can be...

1414
01:21:44,774 --> 01:21:47,234
- What are the police doing here? - It's nothing.

1415
01:21:47,402 --> 01:21:50,446
- What are the police doing here? - We had a slight burglary...

1416
01:21:50,614 --> 01:21:55,242
- It's nothing. I was assuring Mr Lingk... - Mr James Lingk? Your contract went out.

1417
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:56,535
- Don't worry. ROMA: John.

1418
01:21:56,703 --> 01:21:58,954
- Your contract went to the bank. - You cashed my cheque?

1419
01:21:59,122 --> 01:22:01,206
- Mr Williamson... - The cheque was cashed,

1420
01:22:01,374 --> 01:22:04,168
the contract was filed and deposited in the bank.

1421
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:07,922
- And we're completely insured in any case. - You cashed the cheque?

1422
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:10,466
Not to my knowledge, no.

1423
01:22:10,634 --> 01:22:12,468
I'm sure we can...

1424
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:15,095
- Not to my knowledge. - Christ. I...

1425
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:19,808
Oh, Christ. Hey, don't follow me. Just don't follow me, OK?

1426
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:25,981
I've let you down. I know I've let you down. I'm sorry. Forgive me.

1427
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:27,858
I... I've...

1428
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:30,110
I don't know.

1429
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:32,613
I don't know any more.

1430
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:34,406
(Sighs) I'm...

1431
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:37,534
(Sighs) Forgive me.

1432
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:54,802
You stupid fucking cunt.

1433
01:22:56,262 --> 01:23:00,432
You, Williamson. I'm talking to you, shithead. You just cost me $6,000.

1434
01:23:01,768 --> 01:23:03,727
$6,000.

1435
01:23:03,895 --> 01:23:06,355
And one Cadillac. That's right.

1436
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:09,984
What are you gonna do about it?

1437
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:13,946
What are you gonna do about it... asshole?

1438
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:16,699
You're fucking shit.

1439
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:21,912
Where did you learn your trade, you stupid fucking cunt? You idiot.

1440
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,707
Whoever told you that you could work with men?

1441
01:23:24,874 --> 01:23:26,333
DETECTIVE: Could I er?

1442
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:28,627
Oh, I'm gonna have your job, shithead.

1443
01:23:28,795 --> 01:23:32,923
I'm going downtown. I'm gonna talk to Mitch and Murray. I'm going to Lemkin!

1444
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:34,967
I don't care whose nephew you are,

1445
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:39,555
who you know, whose dick you're suckin' on - you're going out.

1446
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:43,642
- I swear to you, you're going... - Hey, fella. Let's get this done.

1447
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:48,063
Anyone in this office lives on his wits.

1448
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:51,650
I'm gonna be with you in a second.

1449
01:23:54,779 --> 01:23:57,698
What you're hired for is to help us.

1450
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:00,576
Does that seem clear to you?

1451
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:05,622
To help us... not to fuck us up.

1452
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:12,087
To help men who are going out there to try to earn a living, you fairy.

1453
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:14,798
You company man.

1454
01:24:14,966 --> 01:24:17,760
I'll tell you something - I hope you ripped the joint off.

1455
01:24:17,927 --> 01:24:21,430
I can tell our friend here a little something might help him to catch you.

1456
01:24:26,644 --> 01:24:28,562
You wanna learn the first rule?

1457
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:31,356
You'd know if you ever spent a day in your life.

1458
01:24:32,942 --> 01:24:36,528
You never open your mouth till you know what the shot is.

1459
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,325
You fucking child.

1460
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:56,298
You are a shithead, Williamson.

1461
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:57,925
Hmm.

1462
01:24:58,635 --> 01:25:02,054
Can't think on your feet, you ought to keep your mouth closed.

1463
01:25:02,222 --> 01:25:04,890
Can you hear me? I'm talking to you. Can you hear me?

1464
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:07,017
Yes, I hear you.

1465
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:11,105
Ricky's right. Can't learn it in an office, gotta learn it in the street.

1466
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:13,607
- Sure can't buy it. You gotta live it. - Mm.

1467
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:15,734
Yeah - "Mm." Yeah, precisely. Huh?

1468
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:20,155
Because your partner depends... I'm talking to you, trying to tell you something.

1469
01:25:20,323 --> 01:25:21,323
- You are? - Yeah.

1470
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:23,659
- What are you telling me? - What Roma told you.

1471
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:26,245
What I told you. You don't belong in this business.

1472
01:25:26,412 --> 01:25:27,996
- I don't belong... - Listen to me.

1473
01:25:28,164 --> 01:25:31,416
One day you could say, "Hey, maybe the guy..." Oh, fuck it.

1474
01:25:31,584 --> 01:25:34,044
Listen to me now. Your partner depends on you.

1475
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:37,381
Your partner, the man who is your partner, depends on you,

1476
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:39,925
and you go with him and for him or you're shit.

1477
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:43,178
- Huh? You are shit. You can't exist alone. - Excuse me.

1478
01:25:43,346 --> 01:25:45,514
Excuse you nothing. Be as cold as you want.

1479
01:25:45,682 --> 01:25:49,226
You just fucked a good man out of $6,000 and his goddamn bonus

1480
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:51,728
because you didn't know the shot.

1481
01:25:51,896 --> 01:25:54,898
You can do that and you're not man enough to say it gets you?

1482
01:25:55,066 --> 01:25:58,569
If you can't take something from that, then you're... scum.

1483
01:25:58,736 --> 01:26:00,737
You're fucking white bread.

1484
01:26:00,905 --> 01:26:02,865
A child would know it. He's right.

1485
01:26:03,032 --> 01:26:06,869
If you're gonna make something up, John, be sure that it helps. Hm?

1486
01:26:07,912 --> 01:26:09,872
- Or keep your mouth shut. - Hm.

1487
01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:12,082
I'm done with you.

1488
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:22,968
(Shelley mutters)

1489
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:26,430
How do you know I made it up?

1490
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:27,890
What?

1491
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:31,268
How do you know I made it up?

1492
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:34,563
What are you talking about? Huh?

1493
01:26:37,108 --> 01:26:40,194
You said, "Don't make something up unless it's sure to help."

1494
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:42,112
Mm.

1495
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:43,780
How did you know I made it up?

1496
01:26:43,948 --> 01:26:45,949
What are you talking about?

1497
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:56,919
I told the customer his contract had gone to the bank.

1498
01:26:57,086 --> 01:26:59,338
Mm. Well, had it?

1499
01:27:03,009 --> 01:27:04,927
No, it hadn't.

1500
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:11,516
Don't fuck with me. Don't fuck with me! What are you getting at?

1501
01:27:11,684 --> 01:27:13,769
Well, I'm saying this, Shelley...

1502
01:27:17,148 --> 01:27:21,068
Usually I take the contracts to the bank. Last night I didn't.

1503
01:27:23,529 --> 01:27:26,615
Last night I stayed home with my kids.

1504
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:30,827
How did you know that?

1505
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:36,792
One night in a year, I left a contract on my desk.

1506
01:27:38,461 --> 01:27:40,379
No one knew that but you.

1507
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:43,173
Now, how did you know that?

1508
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:46,885
You wanna talk to me or you wanna talk to someone else?

1509
01:27:47,053 --> 01:27:49,012
- Oh, for... - Because this is my job.

1510
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:52,391
This is my job on the line and you are gonna talk to me.

1511
01:27:52,558 --> 01:27:54,685
How did you know the contract was on my desk?

1512
01:27:56,187 --> 01:27:58,021
You are so full of shit.

1513
01:27:58,189 --> 01:28:02,693
- You robbed the office. - Oh, sure. I robbed the office! You asshole.

1514

I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail, believe me. Where are the leads?

1673
01:37:27,341 --> 01:37:29,968
* When you're in love, my, how they fly

1674
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:34,013
* Blue day, all the day long

1681
01:38:35,826 --> 01:38:37,869
* In the morning there's bluebirds

1682
01:38:38,037 --> 01:38:40,955
* Singing a song

1683
01:38:41,123 --> 01:38:43,833
* Nothing, but nothing, but bluebirds

1684
01:38:44,001 --> 01:38:46,085

1702
01:39:35,177 --> 01:39:37,804
