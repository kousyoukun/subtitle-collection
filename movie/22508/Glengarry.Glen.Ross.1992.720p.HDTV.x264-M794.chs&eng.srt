2
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,528
麻烦你，2306
2306, please.

3
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:39,400
甜心，你好吗？
Hello, honey. How you doing?

4
00:02:39,476 --> 00:02:43,344
好 他怎么说？
Good. What did he say?

5
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:47,975
他还在那里吗？ 他离开多久了？
Uh huh. Is he still there? How long ago did he leave?

6
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:51,953
我一会儿还要开个会
Uh huh. I'm stopping here, then I got a little meeting,

7
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:54,649
然后 可以的话我会去看你
and then I'll... I would if I could.

8
00:02:54,724 --> 00:02:57,852
我尽快好了 我要动身了 
As soon as I can. Let me get off and I...

9
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:02,159
我答应你一切都会办好的
let me get off and I prom... I promise you it'll be okay.

10
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:08,028
一堆废话 浪费我的时间
A bunch of bullshit. Waste a good man's time.

11
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:18,014
你好，卢云医生在吗？
Hi, could I speak to Dr. Lowenstein, please?

12
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:20,709
我有很重要的事找他 请他听电话好吗？
It's rather important. Could you get him for me?

13
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,480
和那些二溜子谈生意真费劲
Bunch of bullshit trying to make a living on these deadbeat leads.

14
00:03:23,553 --> 00:03:25,987
我今天开了个会…
I swear to God, Shel, I'm on a sit today...

15
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:29,321
你好，史太太 我是大卫莫斯
Hello, Mrs. Swoboda, this is Dave Moss.

16
00:03:29,392 --> 00:03:31,383
对，我们昨天通过电话
Yeah, we spoke yesterday.

17
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:35,227
现在，关于尼奥牧场的事 我们遇上个新情况
Now on the Rio Rancho Estates, we've had a situation just come up.

18
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,892
我们公司的主席只能在镇上待一天
The president of our company is in town just one day,

19
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,266
他有单生意要和你们 医生 
 and he has certain parcels... Doctor...

20
00:03:40,337 --> 00:03:43,363
你能让史先生 你什么意思？
well, could you get... what do you mean?

21
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,170
他不在？ 我有话要跟他说
He's not there? I have to speak to him.

22
00:03:46,243 --> 00:03:50,179
很重要的事情 我是赖芬先生
Yes, it is fairly urgent. Mr. Levene.

23
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:54,513
我没固定联络方式 我会再打电话找他的
No, I can't be reached. I'll get back to him.

24
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:56,779
他有项投资计划
He has certain parcels... certain choice parcels

25
00:03:56,853 --> 00:03:59,344
他只给我48小时时间
which he's given me a hold on for the next 48 hours.

26
00:03:59,422 --> 00:04:02,357
什么时候最好？ 我是说来见你和你先生
What would be the best time to get you and your husband together?

27
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:07,419
今晚十点还是明早八点？
Say, tonight, at 10:00, or tomorrow at 8:00?

28
00:04:07,464 --> 00:04:09,955
好
Okay.

29
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:12,627
那什么时候最好？
Okay, what would be the best time to do that?

30
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,666
听着，你寄来了 不，不，先听我说
Look, you sent in the... no, no, listen to me now...

31
00:04:17,744 --> 00:04:20,474
我现在有四十八小时来让你发财
I've got 48 hours to make you a lot of money.

32
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:26,215
他什么时候回家？ 好，我十分钟后再打来吧
Well, when will he be home? Fine, I'll call you back in 10 minutes.

33
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:30,449
他们不给你指引，不给你支持
They don't give you the leads, they don't give you the support,

34
00:04:30,524 --> 00:04:32,355
他们什么都不给你 没错
 they don't give you dick. Yeah.

35
00:04:32,426 --> 00:04:34,417
然后就使劲拉我们进什么销售会
Then they're yanking us in on some sales conference.

36
00:04:34,461 --> 00:04:37,589
上次有人赚到钱是什么时候的事了？
When's the last time anybody learned a goddamn thing?

37
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:40,031
真想找人开枪射死他
All it does is some jerk shoots his mouth off.

38
00:04:41,768 --> 00:04:45,135
我发誓，我几乎想要跳槽了
I swear to God, Shel, I got half a mind to go across the street.

39
00:04:45,205 --> 00:04:47,696
如果他们要我的话 我也跟你一起跳槽
I got half a mind to go with you if they'd take me.

40
00:04:47,774 --> 00:04:51,938
你永远不会知道 我上星期和谢利格拉夫见过面
You never know... I was talking to Jerry Graff last week.

41
00:04:53,614 --> 00:04:56,174
我得给那些二溜子打电话了
I got to call these deadbeats back.

42
00:04:57,284 --> 00:04:59,479
那些狗屁生意不能让我赚到一毛钱
I can't make a goddamn dollar with these leads,

43
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,384
而你却要把我踢到街上自生自灭
and you're killing my ass on the street.

44
00:05:01,455 --> 00:05:03,787
我真难过你在这里做的不开心 别假惺惺了
 I'm sorry you aren't happy here. That's cute,

45
00:05:03,857 --> 00:05:06,348
你把这办公室弄的一团糟
but you're running this office like a bunch of bullshit.

46
00:05:06,426 --> 00:05:08,553
你赚到钱公司才能赚钱
You're on an override... you make money, we make money.

47
00:05:08,595 --> 00:05:11,655
所以我希望你多赚点钱 那就别浪费我的时间
 I'd like you to make more money. Then don't go waste my time.

48
00:05:11,698 --> 00:05:14,428
给我更多生意，而不是开销售会议 策略是商业区的人定下来的
 A sales conference? The strategy comes from downtown.

49
00:05:14,468 --> 00:05:16,766
策略？
Oh, the strategy? The strategy?

50
00:05:16,837 --> 00:05:18,862
我想我还是放弃好了 我不会
 Well, I think I'll pass. I wouldn't.

51
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:21,806
为什么？ 你是我的话便会明白的
 Why is that? When you come, then you'll see.

52
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,935
 沙利. 约翰
 Shelly. John.

53
00:05:25,012 --> 00:05:27,071
你今晚打算干活吗？
Are you ready to do or die tonight?

54
00:05:27,147 --> 00:05:29,081
我随时准备好候命，约翰
Oh yeah, always ready, John.

55
00:05:29,149 --> 00:05:31,481
随时，约翰 对了 
Always ready, John. Now, one thing...

56
00:05:31,551 --> 00:05:33,519
我们在说那些生意 又有新的生意了吗？
we were talking about the leads. We got some new ones?

57
00:05:33,587 --> 00:05:35,851
我们会在会上讨论这个的
That's what we're going to talk about at the meeting.

58
00:05:35,923 --> 00:05:38,357
我在工作上遇到些阻碍
We are? Because I'm running into a bit of a snag.

59
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:40,188
对，我看过你的销售数字了
Yes, I've seen your sales figures.

60
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,319
你给我更好的生意 
That's the leads. You give me a better lead...

61
00:05:42,396 --> 00:05:44,455
那正是我们要谈的
That's what we're going to be talking about.

62
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:46,328
这是私人麻烦
I'm in a bind... personal problems.

63
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,197
我完全同意 会后再谈吧
 I could use a leg up. After the meeting.

64
00:05:48,235 --> 00:05:51,432
我听说格兰加利那边的生意 开完会再谈，沙利
 I hear the new Glengarry leads... After the meeting, Shel.

65
00:05:51,505 --> 00:05:53,439
嘿，理查德 你好，约翰
 Hey, Ricky. Hello, John.

66
00:05:53,507 --> 00:05:56,067
外面在下雨 什么？
 Wet out there tonight. Huh?

67
00:05:56,143 --> 00:06:00,637
外面在下雨 哦
 Wet out there tonight. Uh huh.

68
00:06:00,714 --> 00:06:02,875
也许这有助减低热度 对
 Maybe it'll break the heat. Yeah.

69
00:06:06,486 --> 00:06:09,717
艾尔，给我一杯J＆B 两杯
Al, give me a quick J&B, huh? Double.

70
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,553
好一个坏女人，艾尔
Cutty, Al.

71
00:06:14,628 --> 00:06:17,153
他们说… 什么？
 They say... Huh?

72
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,996
他们说下午商业区那里非常热
they say it was so hot downtown this afternoon,

73
00:06:21,068 --> 00:06:25,562
热得街角的人走向警察
grown men on the street corner were going up to cops

74
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:28,335
求警察开枪杀了他们
begging the cops to shoot them.

75
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:33,209
据说天热的时候不应该喝酒
They say you should not drink alcohol when it's so hot.

76
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,546
谁说的？ 我从报上看到的
 Who says that? Something I read.

77
00:06:37,617 --> 00:06:40,950
他们说这会让你脱水
For they say it dehydrates you.

78
00:06:41,021 --> 00:06:43,854
他们还说你应该喝清水
They say you should drink water,

79
00:06:43,924 --> 00:06:48,088
但我却比较相信这样一个哲理
but I subscribe to the law of contrary public opinion.

80
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:52,521
当大家看法都一样的时候 我便会持相反的看法
If everyone thinks one thing, then I say bet the other way.

81
00:06:53,767 --> 00:06:55,735
那是因为你知道他们是错的
Added to which, you know they're wrong.

82
00:06:55,802 --> 00:06:58,270
我就是那个意思
That's what I'm saying.

83
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,878
 Slow tonight. Oh, yeah.

84
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:07,071
我想大家都应是留在家里
Well, I guess everybody's staying home.

85
00:07:07,147 --> 00:07:09,445
如果我女儿或别的人打电话来
If my daughter calls, anybody calls,

86
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:13,077
就说我在办公室 谢谢
I'm over at the office. Thanks.

87
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:48,515
我找到个穿着朴素的女人
I had a woman in White Plains on the hook...

88
00:07:48,588 --> 00:07:51,557
她有五个单位，能看见山景的那种 发生什么事了？
five units, Mountain View... what happens?

89
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,456
她要找她的律师咨询一下
She has to check with her lawyer.

90
00:07:53,527 --> 00:07:56,087
你让她找她的律师了？ 我还能怎么做？
 You let her check with her lawyer? What could I do?

91
00:07:56,163 --> 00:07:58,688
我不知道 沙利
 I dunno. Shelly.

92
00:07:58,765 --> 00:08:00,858
什么事？ 那人是谁？
 Huh? Who's the guy?

93
00:08:00,934 --> 00:08:02,868
不能告诉你
Couldn't tell you.

94
00:08:02,936 --> 00:08:06,633
我不喜欢那样 我只是需要一单生意
I don't like the whole thing, because all I need is a lead.

95
00:08:06,706 --> 00:08:08,435
他们却不给我 哦
 They won't give out... Uh huh.

96
00:08:08,508 --> 00:08:11,102
富者越富是这国家的法则
The rich get richer, that's the law of the land.

97
00:08:11,178 --> 00:08:13,339
那宝马是谁的？
Who belongs to the BM...?

98
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:20,450
已经七点半了
It is 7:30.

99
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,681
那他究竟是谁？
So who is that?

100
00:08:23,757 --> 00:08:25,691
还有诺马在哪里？
And where is Mr. Roma?

101
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,420
我怎么会知道
Well, I'm not a leash, so I don't know, do I?

102
00:08:28,562 --> 00:08:32,555
大家都仔细听好了
Let me have your attention for a moment.

103
00:08:32,632 --> 00:08:35,863
你们在谈些什么？ 你们在谈 
You're talking about what? You're talking about...

104
00:08:37,237 --> 00:08:39,296
你们找到的那单生意
bitching about that sale you shot,

105
00:08:39,372 --> 00:08:41,567
有些人不想买土地
some son of a bitch don't want to buy land,

106
00:08:41,641 --> 00:08:43,006
有些人不要你在卖的东西
somebody don't want what you're selling,

107
00:08:43,043 --> 00:08:45,011
某个你们想榨出油水的吝莨
some broad you're trying to screw, so forth.

108
00:08:45,045 --> 00:08:47,138
还是谈些更重要的事情吧
Let's talk about something important.

109
00:08:47,214 --> 00:08:48,841
都到齐了吗？ 还差一个
 Are they all here? All but one.

110
00:08:48,882 --> 00:08:49,871
不管他了，开会
I'm going anyway.

111
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:53,477
还是谈些更重要的事情吧
Let's talk about something important.

112
00:08:53,553 --> 00:08:55,919
放下手上的咖啡
Put that coffee down.

113
00:09:00,527 --> 00:09:03,496
咖啡是给成功人士喝的
Coffee's for closers only.

114
00:09:05,932 --> 00:09:08,400
你以为我是在闹着玩的吗？
You think I'm fucking with you?

115
00:09:11,838 --> 00:09:13,635
我不是和你开玩笑
I am not fucking with you.

116
00:09:14,374 --> 00:09:16,569
我是从商业区来的
I'm here from downtown.

117
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:18,201
我是从默里公司来的
I'm here from Mitch and Murray.

118
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:21,441
我是来指引你们的
And I'm here on a mission of mercy.

119
00:09:25,352 --> 00:09:28,844
你是赖芬？ 对
 Your name's Levene? Yeah.

120
00:09:28,922 --> 00:09:32,722
你个狗娘养的人称自己做经纪人？
You call yourself a salesman, you son of a bitch?

121
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:34,521
我不想再听下去了
I don't got to listen to this shit.

122
00:09:34,594 --> 00:09:37,859
你当然不会再听下去了 因为有好消息等着你，你别开除了
You certainly don't, 'cause the good news is, you're fired.

123
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:42,397
坏消息是你们大家有…
The bad news is you've got... all of you've got...

124
00:09:42,469 --> 00:09:44,460
一星期时间保住你们的饭碗
just one week to regain your jobs,

125
00:09:44,538 --> 00:09:47,996
从今晚这会议开始算起
starting with tonight... starting with tonight's sit.

126
00:09:50,577 --> 00:09:53,876
你们都听清楚了吗？
Oh, have I got your attention now?

127
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:57,810
很好
Good...

128
00:09:59,386 --> 00:10:00,978
因为我们还给这个月的销售竞争
'cause we're adding a little something

129
00:10:01,054 --> 00:10:02,715
加了点东西
to this month's sales contest.

130
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:05,849
你们都知道第一名的奖励 是一辆卡迪拉克
As you all know, first prize is a Cadillac Eldorado.

131
00:10:05,926 --> 00:10:07,951
有人想知道第二名的奖励是什么吗？
Anybody want to see second prize?

132
00:10:08,028 --> 00:10:11,464
是一套牛扒刀具
Second prize is a set of steak knives.

133
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,332
三奖是炒鱼
Third prize is you're fired.

134
00:10:20,106 --> 00:10:23,769
明白了吗？ 你们还在笑吗？
Do you get the picture? Are you laughing now?

135
00:10:23,843 --> 00:10:28,246
你做成生意，公司会付很好的价钱
You got leads. Mitch and Murray paid good money.

136
00:10:28,315 --> 00:10:30,476
努力做成每一单生意
Get their names to sell them.

137
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,575
你不能拒绝做交代下来的生意
You can't close the leads you're given,

138
00:10:32,652 --> 00:10:35,314
你是堆臭狗屎！
you can't close shit, you are shit!

139
00:10:35,388 --> 00:10:38,915
不管多困难都要做成生意！
Hit the bricks, pal, and beat it, 'cause you are going out!

140
00:10:38,992 --> 00:10:42,450
给我们的生意都很棘手 棘手？
 The leads are weak. The leads are weak?

141
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:45,259
他妈的生意很棘手？ 其实是你太烂
The fucking leads are weak? You're weak.

142
00:10:45,332 --> 00:10:47,300
我干这行已经十五年了
I've been in this business 15 years.

143
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:49,665
你叫什么名字？ 操你 
 What's your name? Fuck you...

144
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:52,261
那就是我的名字！ 你知道为什么吗？
that's my name! You know why, mister?

145
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:54,466
因为你今晚开现代的烂车来开会
Because you drove a Hyundai to get here tonight,

146
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:59,444
我开的是八万美元的宝马 那就是我的名字
I drove an $80,000 BMW. That's my name.

147
00:11:03,683 --> 00:11:06,777
而你的名字是“不够格”
And your name is "You're wanting."

148
00:11:06,853 --> 00:11:10,016
你没资格玩这游戏
You can't play in the man's game? You can't close them?

149
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:13,457
那就回家向你老婆诉苦
Then go home and tell your wife your troubles.

150
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:17,291
因为生活中只有一件事最重要
Because only one thing counts in this life...

151
00:11:17,364 --> 00:11:20,731
就是让客户在合约上签字！
get them to sign on the line which is dotted!

152
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,735
听到了吗，你们这群混蛋？
You hear me, you fucking faggots?

153
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:33,411
“A B C”
"A B C."

154
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,472
A 永远，B 做 C 成功者
A... Always, B... Be, C... Closing.

155
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:38,483
永远做个成功者
Always Be Closing.

156
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:42,214
“永远做个成功者”
"Always Be Closing."

157
00:11:43,156 --> 00:11:44,953
，，A I D A，
"A I D A."

158
00:11:45,025 --> 00:11:47,721
“注意，兴趣，决定，行动”
"Attention, Interest, Decision, Action."

159
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:50,262
注意力 大家注意听我说两句好吗？
Attention... Do I have your attention?

160
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,457
兴趣 你感兴趣吗？
Interest... Are you interested?

161
00:11:52,532 --> 00:11:54,796
我知道你感兴趣，因为别无选择
I know you are, because it's fuck or walk.

162
00:11:54,868 --> 00:11:56,859
不想失败的话就打破障碍
You close or you hit the bricks.

163
00:11:56,936 --> 00:12:01,168
决定 你有做出决定吗？
Decision... Have you made your decision for Christ?

164
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:05,905
还有…行动 “A I D A”
And Action. "A I D A."

165
00:12:05,979 --> 00:12:08,277
走出这里 你们还有大好前程
Get out there... you got the prospects coming in.

166
00:12:08,348 --> 00:12:10,509
你以为他们进来是为了躲雨？
You think they came in to get out of the rain?

167
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,983
一个人不是要买便不会走进来
A guy don't walk on the lot lest he wants to buy.

168
00:12:13,053 --> 00:12:16,352
他们正等着送钱给你
They're sitting out there waiting to give you their money.

169
00:12:16,423 --> 00:12:18,448
你有本事拿吗？
Are you gonna take it?

170
00:12:18,525 --> 00:12:21,653
你够胆去拿吗？
Are you man enough to take it?

171
00:12:28,501 --> 00:12:30,093
废话
Crap.

172
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,070
有什么问题吗，伙计？ 你，莫斯
What's the problem, pal? You... Moss.

173
00:12:32,138 --> 00:12:34,606
你是如此的英雄，如此的富有
You're such a hero, you're so rich,

174
00:12:34,674 --> 00:12:37,939
为何你会来这里跟一群酒鬼浪费时间？
how come you're here wasting your time with a bunch of bums?

175
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,580
看见这表了吗？
You see this watch?

176
00:12:45,218 --> 00:12:48,984
看见了吗？ 看到了
 You see this watch? Yeah.

177
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:52,252
这表比你的车还要贵
That watch costs more than your car.

178
00:12:52,325 --> 00:12:56,386
去年我赚了97万 你赚了多少？
I made $70,000 last year. How much you make?

179
00:12:58,398 --> 00:13:03,802
伙计，那就是我 而你就是个无名小子
You see, pal... that's who I am, and you're nothing.

180
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,738
我从不做好人
Nice guy? I don't give a shit.

181
00:13:07,807 --> 00:13:11,800
好父亲？去你妈的 回家陪孩子去玩吧
Good father? Fuck you... go home and play with your kids.

182
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:16,406
你们要想继续在这里工作 那就围着客户转！
You want to work here... close!

183
00:13:16,483 --> 00:13:19,748
你认为这是侮辱？
You think this is abuse?

184
00:13:19,819 --> 00:13:21,878
你们这群混蛋认为这是侮辱？
You think this is abuse, you cocksucker?

185
00:13:21,955 --> 00:13:25,618
连这都受不了的话 怎样面对谈生意时的尴尬场面？
You can't take this, how can you take the abuse you get on a sit?

186
00:13:26,693 --> 00:13:30,185
你不喜欢的话就离开好了
You don't like it, leave.

187
00:13:32,165 --> 00:13:35,566
我可以用你们手上的资料
I can go out there tonight... the materials you got...

188
00:13:35,635 --> 00:13:39,731
为自己赚到一万五千块 今晚，两小时内！
make myself $15,000. Tonight... in two hours!

189
00:13:39,806 --> 00:13:41,637
你可以吗？
Can you?

190
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:45,405
你可以吗？
Can you?

191
00:13:46,846 --> 00:13:50,373
照我说的去做，“A I D A”
Go and do likewise. "A I D A."

192
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,044
疯狂的去推销，狗娘养的！
Get mad, you son of a bitches. Get mad!

193
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:57,055
你知道卖房地产的技巧吗？
You know what it takes to sell real estate?

194
00:13:57,123 --> 00:14:00,820
这可不是件容易的事情
It takes brass balls to sell real estate.

195
00:14:05,498 --> 00:14:08,160
照我说的去试试吧
Go and do likewise, gents.

196
00:14:08,234 --> 00:14:10,634
钱就在外面 只要你拿的走，就是你的了
The money's out there... you pick it up, it's yours,

197
00:14:10,703 --> 00:14:13,001
你拿不到的话我也不会同情你
you don't, I got no sympathy for you.

198
00:14:13,072 --> 00:14:14,903
今晚就去谈生意，围着客户转
You want to go out on those sits tonight and close...

199
00:14:14,974 --> 00:14:16,703
那钱就是你的了
close... it's yours.

200
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:18,937
不然你就只能替我擦鞋子
Not, you're gonna be shining my shoes.

201
00:14:19,012 --> 00:14:21,742
你知道那有多少可怜
And you know what you'll be saying.

202
00:14:21,815 --> 00:14:24,443
一群失败者坐在酒巴里
Bunch of losers sitting around in a bar,

203
00:14:24,517 --> 00:14:28,613
“我以前是个经纪 过着花天酒地的生活”
"Oh yeah, I used to be a salesman. It's a tough racket."

204
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,764
这些是新的生意
These are the new leads.

205
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,893
格兰加利的生意
These are the Glengarry leads.

206
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:47,668
对你们来说，这些就是金子 你们得不到这些生意
And to you, they're gold. And you don't get them.

207
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,504
为什么呢？
Why?

208
00:14:50,577 --> 00:14:54,570
因为把这些生意交给你们 就等于把它们扔掉
Because to give them to you is just throwing them away.

209
00:14:58,585 --> 00:15:01,019
这些只能给有能力的人去做
They're for closers.

210
00:15:07,093 --> 00:15:08,355
我祝你们好运
I'd wish you good luck,

211
00:15:08,428 --> 00:15:10,692
但你们即使得到这些生意 也不知道该如何处理
but you wouldn't know what to do with it if you got it.

212
00:15:15,268 --> 00:15:19,864
现在我来回答你的问题 “为什么我来这里？”
And to answer your question, pal... "Why am I here?"

213
00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:22,908
我来这里是因为公司要我来
I came here because Mitch and Murray asked me to.

214
00:15:22,976 --> 00:15:25,672
他们要我帮忙 我说，真要我帮忙的话就是 
They asked me for a favor. I said, "The real favor...

215
00:15:25,745 --> 00:15:28,737
听我的劝告，炒掉那些废物
follow my advice and fire your fucking ass,

216
00:15:28,815 --> 00:15:31,306
因为失败者永远是失败者
because a loser is a loser."

217
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:44,921
废话连篇
Bunch of fucking nonsense...

218
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:47,694
竟然那样对待我们
treat people like that.

219
00:15:49,402 --> 00:15:52,428
他要走了？
The fuck is he going to get off?

220
00:15:52,505 --> 00:15:55,872
老鼠会 他不是这个意思
 Mickey Mouse sales conference. He didn't mean it.

221
00:15:55,942 --> 00:15:58,809
我肯定他不是要降低生意配额
I'm sure he didn't mean it about trimming down the sales quota.

222
00:15:58,878 --> 00:16:01,073
理查德诺马在哪里？
Where is Roma? Where the hell is Mr. Ricky Roma?

223
00:16:01,147 --> 00:16:03,513
我们在这听废话的时候他在哪里？
All the while we got to sit here, eat this nonsense?

224
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,711
我是赖芬 她还好吗？
Hello? Mr. Levene. How's she doing?

225
00:16:06,786 --> 00:16:08,777
她醒了吗？
Uh huh, yeah. Is she awake?

226
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:11,380
医生来过了 他说了什么没有？
Oh, the doctor came by. What did he say?

227
00:16:11,457 --> 00:16:15,018
我今晚不能来了
Uh huh. I can't come in tonight.

228
00:16:15,094 --> 00:16:17,858
我知道她想见我
I think... I know she is. I know that she is.

229
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:21,799
我现在要出去了 她醒了以后请转告她
I've gotta go out. Will you please tell her when she wakes?

230
00:16:21,868 --> 00:16:25,827
我得出去了 告诉她我会在路上打电话给她的
I've got to go out. Tell her I'll call her from the road.

231
00:16:25,905 --> 00:16:27,497
谢谢
Thank you.

232
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:32,903
先生们，你们都听到了
Gentlemen, you heard the man.

233
00:16:32,979 --> 00:16:34,776
这对我们有什么帮助？
What is this in aid of?

234
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:36,940
今晚 对不起
 As of tonight... What is this? Excuse me.

235
00:16:37,016 --> 00:16:39,177
总公司要我们 
What it's in aid of is that Mitch and Murray...

236
00:16:39,252 --> 00:16:41,982
去他妈的破公司！ 我是在工作
Fuck Mitch and Murray! I'm doing my job,

237
00:16:42,055 --> 00:16:43,852
不是在陪这小儿科的家伙玩！
I got to put up with this childishness?

238
00:16:43,923 --> 00:16:45,788
规矩不是我定的 我负责这办公室的运作
I don't make the rules. I'm paid to run the office.

239
00:16:45,858 --> 00:16:48,224
你不喜欢这些规矩，戴夫？ 门就在那儿！
You don't like the rules, Dave? There's the door!

240
00:16:50,229 --> 00:16:54,723
今天晚上两单生意 明天还有两单
Two lead cards for tonight, two lead cards for tomorrow.

241
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:56,530
你们都听到了，到了月底
As you heard, end of the month,

242
00:16:56,603 --> 00:16:58,696
营业额最高的经纪就得到那辆卡迪拉克
top salesman on the board gets the Eldorado.

243
00:16:58,771 --> 00:17:00,898
第二名 那些好生意呢？
 Next man down the... What about the good leads?

244
00:17:00,974 --> 00:17:03,340
我给了你们生意了 可你给我们的都是垃圾！
 The leads I've given you. But these leads are shit.

245
00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:05,240
我见过这名字一百次了
They're old... I've seen that name 100 times.

246
00:17:05,278 --> 00:17:08,475
生意是随机分配的 新的生意呢？
 The leads are assigned randomly. What about the new leads?

247
00:17:08,548 --> 00:17:10,345
新的生意 格兰加利的生意
The new leads... the Glengarry leads.

248
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,748
暂时不会分配给你们
I've got them. I'm going to hang onto them.

249
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:14,912
我打算交给有能力的人去做
And they'll be assigned to closers,

250
00:17:14,988 --> 00:17:17,354
看销量的话，首先应该交给诺马
based on the sales volume, first to Roma.

251
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:19,357
他在哪里？ 别担心诺马
 Where is Roma? Don't worry about Roma.

252
00:17:19,425 --> 00:17:21,052
诺马会有他的生意，你也是
He'll get his leads, you've got yours.

253
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:23,254
他的营业额最高 所以就不用来开这会？
He's top name on the board, so he don't have to be here?

254
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:25,820
没错！ 时间一分一秒的过去
That's correct! And as the hour is waning,

255
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:28,731
我建议对这工作还感兴趣的人
I suggest you... those of you who are interested

256
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:31,599
赶紧去工作吧
in a continuing job with this organization, get to work.

257
00:17:31,671 --> 00:17:33,696
废话
That's garbage. Bullshit.

258
00:17:33,773 --> 00:17:35,468
多谢 废话！
 Thank you for your attention. Bullshit!

259
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:39,671
我有什么办法卖掉这些？ 看看这个
How am I supposed to close these? Look at this.

260
00:17:39,746 --> 00:17:42,715
我以前和这家伙打过交道 我去过他的屋子两次
I've had this guy before. I've been to his house twice.

261
00:17:42,782 --> 00:17:46,513
我做不了这单生意
I... I can't... I can't close this stuff.

262
00:17:49,322 --> 00:17:52,257
沙利，我怎么可能 
Shelly, how am I supposed to...

263
00:17:52,325 --> 00:17:54,987
他们会开除我的！
They're going to bounce me out of a job.

264
00:18:03,002 --> 00:18:06,597
是巴勒莫先生吗？ 我很抱歉
Hello, Mr. Palermo? I'm sorry.

265
00:18:06,673 --> 00:18:10,040
史先生？史罗拔先生？
Mr. Speice? Mr. Robert Speice?

266
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:13,078
对，我是艾乔治
Yeah, this is George Aaronow.

267
00:18:13,146 --> 00:18:16,240
我早前跟你太太通过电话了 关于尼奥牧场的事情
I'm with Rio. I spoke with your wife earlier.

268
00:18:16,315 --> 00:18:19,842
我是亚利桑拿地产公司副主席
I'm the vice president of Rio Rancho Properties in Furman, Arizona.

269
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,152
我是从机场打来的，正在看地图
Yes. I'm calling from the airport, and consulting my map,

270
00:18:25,224 --> 00:18:27,454
我发现你们就住在机场附近
I see that you and your wife live near the airport.

271
00:18:27,527 --> 00:18:30,553
我有一些很不寻常的
I have some rather... rather unusual,

272
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,860
关于你的物业的一些好消息
rather good information on the property...

273
00:18:32,932 --> 00:18:37,335
喂？ 我是沙利赖芬
Hello? Hello, this is Sheldon Levene.

274
00:18:37,403 --> 00:18:40,031
请仔细听好了 我没多少时间
Please listen closely... I only have a moment or so.

275
00:18:40,106 --> 00:18:43,701
我只可以和黎波太太说话
I can speak only to a Mrs. Nyborg.

276
00:18:43,776 --> 00:18:47,735
你就是啊 请用心听好了
Oh, this is Mrs. Nyborg. Please listen closely, Mrs. Nyborg.

277
00:18:47,814 --> 00:18:51,511
我是亚利桑拿地产公司的人
I'm calling from Consolidated Properties of Arizona.

278
00:18:51,584 --> 00:18:55,315
我们的电脑在众多提出申请的
Our computer has chosen you from all of the many thousands

279
00:18:55,388 --> 00:18:58,221
客人中选中了你
who write in requesting information on our properties.

280
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:01,283
根据联邦法律，也许你也知道的
Now by federal law, as you probably know,

281
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,591
即使你不在我们的土地发展计划上
the prize must be awarded to you even if you are not engaged

282
00:19:04,664 --> 00:19:06,655
奖品也是一定要送给你的
in our land development plan.

283
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:10,362
唯一的条件是你和你先生
The only stipulation, of course, is that you and your husband

284
00:19:10,436 --> 00:19:13,599
要同时签收才能得到奖品
must sign at the same time for the receipt of your prize.

285
00:19:13,673 --> 00:19:18,076
我今晚或是明早会在你家附近
Now, I will be in the area tonight, possibly tomorrow.

286
00:19:18,144 --> 00:19:20,704
你认为何时见你和你先生
What do you think might be a convenient time to meet

287
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,907
比较适当？
with both you and your husband?

288
00:19:22,982 --> 00:19:25,610
当然我可以等着
Of course I'll hold.

289
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:41,427
全是废话，对吗？ 我没办法卖掉它们
 Bunch of fucking nonsense, huh? I can't close them.

290
00:19:41,501 --> 00:19:43,025
没人卖的掉 它们太旧了
 Nobody can close 'em. They're old.

291
00:19:43,102 --> 00:19:45,297
它们太古老了 全他妈的废话
They're ancient... a bunch of fucking nonsense.

292
00:19:45,371 --> 00:19:47,669
找个白痴来这里 
Get some jerk to come in here...

293
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,538
有时我会想 “我真的适合干这行吗？”
Sometimes I think, "I wonder if I belong in this business."

294
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,976
派人出去卖房子 没有支持，没有信心
Send a guy out there... no support, no confidence.

295
00:19:53,045 --> 00:19:55,707
然后我说，“没的卖的出去”
Then I say, "Nobody can close 'em."

296
00:19:55,782 --> 00:19:58,307
然后我看着诺马 诺马，他妈的诺马
 Then I look at Roma. Roma... fuck Roma.

297
00:19:58,384 --> 00:20:00,443
行为怪异 还有点小运气
Had a freak... a little run of luck.

298
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,954
这些生意都是垃圾
The leads are garbage.

299
00:20:03,022 --> 00:20:05,115
我说干吗把好生意都给他？
Then I say, "Why give him the good leads?

300
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:07,318
他根本不需要 你出去吗？
 He doesn't need 'em." You going out?

301
00:20:07,393 --> 00:20:11,989
对，我得出去 我没办法谈成生意
Yeah. I have to go out. I can't make a sit.

302
00:20:12,064 --> 00:20:15,966
试过了吗？ 我有点不对劲
 Have you tried? Yeah. Something's wrong with me.

303
00:20:16,035 --> 00:20:18,003
怎么了？ 我有点撑不住了
What is it? I can't push through.

304
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,300
穿上外套 和我一起出去吧
Get your coat on. You're coming out with me.

305
00:20:20,373 --> 00:20:22,466
我有点不对劲 忘了它吧
 Something in me. Forget it.

306
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:25,602
我不停的试着 我说别再想了
 I try, I try. I said forget it, come on.

307
00:20:25,678 --> 00:20:27,942
我没办法谈成生意
I can't close 'em.

308
00:20:31,517 --> 00:20:33,212
生活
Life.

309
00:20:33,286 --> 00:20:35,516
我发誓，一辈子都要努力工作 
I swear to God, you work all your life...

310
00:20:35,588 --> 00:20:39,684
别想了，乔治 象诺马这样的人…
 Forget it, George. Roma, so on...

311
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:42,159
真是得天独厚啊 妈的！
 so gifted. Gifted, my ass!

312
00:20:42,228 --> 00:20:45,789
这家伙真走运 不，不，不
 The guy gets a string of luck. No, no, no.

313
00:20:45,865 --> 00:20:47,560
事情是这样的，钱很难赚
The thing of it is, money's tight.

314
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:49,498
当日子很艰难的时候
When times are tight, it don't do no good

315
00:20:49,569 --> 00:20:51,935
“出去卖这卖那”也没什么好处
to throw around, "Just go out and sell."

316
00:20:52,004 --> 00:20:54,734
竭尽所能也不可能让匹死马跑起来
Threaten a man all you want, you can't whip a dead horse.

317
00:20:54,807 --> 00:20:56,331
是啊 这些垃圾生意 
 Nope. All this garbage...

318
00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:57,899
卖掉一万，你就能得到辆卡迪拉克
"Sell 10,000, you win a Cadillac;

319
00:20:57,977 --> 00:21:01,276
失败的话我们就开除你？ 这方法太古老了
you lose, we're gonna fire your ass"? It's medieval.

320
00:21:01,347 --> 00:21:02,541
对 这是不对的
 Yes. It's wrong.

321
00:21:02,615 --> 00:21:04,082
对
 Yes. Yes it is,

322
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,674
你知道该谁负这责任吗？
and you know who's responsible?

323
00:21:05,751 --> 00:21:07,719
谁？ 你知道的
 Who? You know who it is.

324
00:21:07,753 --> 00:21:09,687
米奇和默里公司 真不应是这样的
It's Mitch and Murray, 'cause it don't have to be this way.

325
00:21:09,722 --> 00:21:11,781
不 看看杰瑞格拉夫
 No. Look at Jerry Graff.

326
00:21:11,824 --> 00:21:13,849
他有自己的生意
He's clean, he's doing business for himself,

327
00:21:13,926 --> 00:21:16,087
他有那护士的名单
he's got that list... with the nurses?

328
00:21:16,162 --> 00:21:21,099
那才是应有的想法 为什么我们只能拿10%的佣金？
You see? That's thinking. Why take a 10% sales commission?

329
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:24,136
干吗要把90%给公司？ 为了什么？
Why are we giving the rest away? What are we giving 90% for?

330
00:21:24,203 --> 00:21:26,831
结果那九成给了坐办公室的
For nothing. For some jerk in the office,

331
00:21:26,906 --> 00:21:29,238
对我们呼来喝去，“快出去做成生意 你就能得到那辆卡迪拉克”
telling us, "Get out there and close, go win a Cadillac."

332
00:21:29,308 --> 00:21:31,936
格拉夫出去后不是干的很成功吗？
Graff goes out and buys. He pays top dollar.

333
00:21:32,011 --> 00:21:33,444
对
 You see? Yes.

334
00:21:33,512 --> 00:21:36,481
那些生意 他手上有很多生意
For the leads... that's thinking. Now, he's got the leads,

335
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:40,747
他为自己赚钱 那才叫有头脑
he goes in business for himself. That's what? That's thinking.

336
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,754
谁有一份稳定的工作
Who... who's got a steady job,

337
00:21:42,822 --> 00:21:44,949
一份稳定的收入？
a regular job, a couple of bucks nobody's touched?

338
00:21:45,024 --> 00:21:46,514
护士
Nurses.

339
00:21:46,592 --> 00:21:48,219
格拉夫弄到份护士名单 只花了一千块
Graff goes and buys a fucking list of nurses. One grand...

340
00:21:48,294 --> 00:21:50,660
他花了两千的话我就把帽子吃了 四千或是五千个护士
he paid two, I'll eat my hat. 4,000 or 5,000 nurses.

341
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,130
他不发才怪呢 是吗？
 He's going wild. He is?

342
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:56,430
对，他干的很好 我听说她们都不太热衷
 Yeah, he's doing very well. I heard they were running cold.

343
00:21:56,502 --> 00:21:58,299
你是说护士？ 对
 The nurses? Yeah.

344
00:21:58,371 --> 00:22:01,534
你听到的倒不少 他的确干的很不错
You hear a lot of things. He's doing very well.

345
00:22:01,607 --> 00:22:03,472
卖那些橡树？ 对，河木还有农场
 With River Oaks? River Oaks, Brook Farms.

346
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:06,238
有人告诉我他一周
All that shit. Somebody told me... you know what he's clearing, himself?

347
00:22:06,312 --> 00:22:09,110
能卖出一万四到一万五的货 就他一个人？
 14, 15 grand a week. Himself?

348
00:22:09,181 --> 00:22:12,514
我要说的就是这个 为什么？就因为他有足够的生意
That's what I'm saying. Why? He's got the leads.

349
00:22:12,585 --> 00:22:15,645
他手上有好生意 而我们呢？
He's got the good leads. What are we?

350
00:22:15,721 --> 00:22:17,484
我们坐在这该死的破车里
We're sitting in the shit here. Why?

351
00:22:17,556 --> 00:22:19,387
因为我们要问公司要生意
Because we got to go to them to get them.

352
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:22,359
我们付给公司九成的钱买生意
90% of our sales we're paying to the office for the leads.

353
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:25,864
还有电话费等很多其他费用
There's our leads, there's overhead, phones, a lot of stuff.

354
00:22:25,932 --> 00:22:27,900
你需要什么？电话？
What do you need? A telephone?

355
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:31,130
还有宽敞的地方用来见客？ 只要有生意就可以了
Some broad to say, "Good morning"? Nothing. It's the leads.

356
00:22:31,203 --> 00:22:33,501
关键在于要有生意，明白吗？
The whole thing is the leads, you understand me?

357
00:22:33,572 --> 00:22:36,370
你要先找到个客户
You can't sell to a void... you got to get a goddamn person.

358
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:39,002
有生意有客户，然后我去卖
You get a lead, you get a person... I'll go sell 'em.

359
00:22:39,078 --> 00:22:40,875
要不他们想要什么？
Otherwise, what do they want from my life?

360
00:22:41,314 --> 00:22:44,977
你好吗，丹尼？ 是我，沙利赖芬
Hello, Danny? Dan, it's Shel Levene.

361
00:22:45,051 --> 00:22:48,077
我们去年五月通过电话
Yeah, we spoke... last May I called you.

362
00:22:48,154 --> 00:22:51,351
我那时在亚利桑拿的
I was in town from my estate in Rio Rancho, and...

363
00:22:51,424 --> 00:22:53,153
尼奥牧场
Arizona.

364
00:22:53,225 --> 00:22:55,455
我真希望那时可以联系上你
I wish we could have gotten together at that time.

365
00:22:55,528 --> 00:22:59,328
丹尼，上次我给你看的物业升值了
Danny, that piece of property I had for you has increased in value...

366
00:22:59,398 --> 00:23:04,597
格雷斯，升到多少了？ 七万六千美元
Grace, Grace, what was that figure? $76,000.

367
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:07,138
我希望你能考虑一下
Oh, Danny, I wish you could have been in on it with me.

368
00:23:07,206 --> 00:23:09,800
我会在这里过夜，明天就得回家
Look, I'm here overnight... I have to go home tomorrow,

369
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:13,743
我想，既然上次你很有兴趣
and I thought, after the interest you showed on the last trip, that...

370
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:17,681
等等，格雷斯 我知道你是认真的
Hold it, Grace. Danny, I know that you're serious,

371
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,844
所以我会推掉所有的约会
and because of that, I am going to shove my appointments around

372
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,947
以确定 我希望 
and make sure... oh, gee, I wish that...

373
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:29,988
好吧，丹尼
All right, Danny. Yeah, all right.

374
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:43,870
今晚要出去吗，沙利？
Going out tonight, Shelly?

375
00:23:46,712 --> 00:23:49,681
今晚宣布的销售竞争计划是什么意思？
What is this bullshit with the sales promotion?

376
00:23:49,749 --> 00:23:51,239
就是那么回事
It isn't bullshit. It's the way it is.

377
00:23:51,317 --> 00:23:53,410
你会炒掉销售业绩最差的人？
You're going to fire the bottom men on the list?

378
00:23:53,486 --> 00:23:55,886
游戏规则不是我定的
That's the way it is and I don't make the rules.

379
00:23:55,955 --> 00:23:59,288
是商业区那里定的规定 我有个小麻烦，约翰
 The rules come from downtown. I got a problem here, John.

380
00:23:59,358 --> 00:24:01,849
我要关门了 一起去喝一杯吧
 I'm closing up the office. Come have a drink with me.

381
00:24:01,927 --> 00:24:05,192
我得回家去了 可以给我五分钟吗？
 I've got to get home. Do me the courtesy... five minutes?

382
00:24:05,264 --> 00:24:07,425
我得在两小时内来回一趟
I am trying to get home for two hours.

383
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,492
我得回家看看孩子，然后回到这里
I got to go home, grab one hour with my kids, come back here,

384
00:24:10,569 --> 00:24:13,060
看看有没有人谈成生意 搞定合约…
see if any of you closed a contract, take the contract...

385
00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:16,666
就一分钟可以吗？ 什么事？
 How about one minute? What is it?

386
00:24:16,742 --> 00:24:18,801
我没办法做成这些生意 那就继续试
 I can't close these leads. Then move on.

387
00:24:18,878 --> 00:24:22,746
别老摆出经理的架子
Don't jump! Don't jump out of your manager bag a second.

388
00:24:22,815 --> 00:24:27,081
只是两个人私下谈谈，对吧？
It's just two guys talking, am I right? We're just talking.

389
00:24:27,153 --> 00:24:29,747
你手上有那些新生意 如果你可以给我 等等
You got the new leads. If you would give me... just hold on.

390
00:24:29,822 --> 00:24:32,586
格兰加利的生意只会 交给有能力的人去做
The Glengarry leads are to be assigned only to closers.

391
00:24:32,658 --> 00:24:35,388
等一下 如果你给我些好生意
Hold on a second. If you give me the good leads...

392
00:24:35,461 --> 00:24:37,088
我上次给你的好生意你也搞砸了
You blew the last good one I gave you.

393
00:24:37,163 --> 00:24:38,824
等等好吗？
No, no... hold on, will you?

394
00:24:38,898 --> 00:24:41,492
我没搞砸 我完成了其中一单
I did not blow 'em. One kicked out. One, I closed.

395
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:43,467
你没有 听我说好吗？
 You didn't close it. Would you listen to me?

396
00:24:43,536 --> 00:24:47,336
我完成了那单生意！ 都是他前妻干的好事，约翰！
I closed that cocksucker! His ex! John, his ex!

397
00:24:47,406 --> 00:24:49,874
我根本不知道他结过婚 法官判那交易无效
I didn't even know he was married. The judge invalidated it.

398
00:24:49,942 --> 00:24:50,840
沙利 
Shelly...

399
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:53,470
我只是不太走运
What was that job, huh? Bad luck. That's all it was.

400
00:24:53,546 --> 00:24:55,741
我常祈祷让霉运远离你
I pray you never find it... it runs in streaks.

401
00:24:55,815 --> 00:24:58,716
希望你事业一帆风顺
That's what it's doing, that's all it does... streaks.

402
00:24:58,784 --> 00:25:02,379
我祈求霉运离你远远的
I pray that it misses you and that's all I have to say.

403
00:25:02,455 --> 00:25:05,447
我得养家糊口啊
Shit, I've got to eat. Williamson...

404
00:25:05,524 --> 00:25:09,654
看看过去的销售记录
look at the sheets. Look at the sheets.

405
00:25:09,728 --> 00:25:13,425
1987，88，89 89年六个月，谁的销售额最高？
1987, '88, '89... six months in '89... who's on top?

406
00:25:13,499 --> 00:25:14,966
诺马 他下面呢
 Roma. Under him?

407
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,798
莫斯 去他妈的，约翰！
 Moss. Oh, bullshit, John!

408
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,464
四月到九月是我 不是他妈的莫斯
April to September it's me... it's no fucking Moss.

409
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:22,871
不客气的说，他只会破坏生意
Due respect, he's an order taker.

410
00:25:22,942 --> 00:25:26,639
但在报告板上是我
Talk... talks a good game, but look on the board, it's me.

411
00:25:26,712 --> 00:25:28,873
最近不是了 最近 
 Not lately it isn't. Not late...

412
00:25:29,648 --> 00:25:31,343
最近 去他妈的最近
Well, lately... kiss my ass "lately".

413
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:34,079
你打电话问问默里和米奇 我们跟着彼德逊时
You call Murray and you call Mitch... when we were on Peterson,

414
00:25:34,153 --> 00:25:36,815
是谁买了新车？ 打电话给米奇啊，塞维尔？
who do you think bought the new car? Call Mitch. The Seville?

415
00:25:36,889 --> 00:25:39,983
他走进来说“你买给我的”
He came in here... "You bought that for me, fella."

416
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:43,961
为什么？ 看着我！
And out of what? Hey, look at me! Out of what? Nothing!

417
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:46,259
你要和我谈销售额？
Cold calling. You want to talk about a sale?

418
00:25:46,332 --> 00:25:48,857
你真要惹急我了，孩子
You are really beginning to burn my ass, kid.

419
00:25:48,934 --> 00:25:53,268
我拿不到生意，你 这是技巧，约翰
I can't get a lead, you... it was skill, John.

420
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:55,807
我能为你工作 你却要抛弃我
It could be working for you... you want to throw it away.

421
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:58,070
那不是我的错 那不是你的错 
 It isn't me. It's not you...

422
00:25:58,144 --> 00:26:00,669
我真怀疑我他妈的是在和谁说话
I wonder who it is. Who the fuck am I talking to?

423
00:26:00,746 --> 00:26:04,512
我需要那些生意 过了月底，竞赛结束后
 I need the leads to sell. After the contest. After the 30th.

424
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:06,813
废话 “竞赛结束后”
Bullshit, "After the contest."

425
00:26:06,886 --> 00:26:09,582
如果到三十号我还不能回到那榜上 他们就会炒掉我的
If I'm not on that board by the 30th, they're going to can my ass.

426
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:16,386
我需要那些生意，现在就要 否则我便死定了
I need those leads and I need 'em now or I'm out.

427
00:26:21,033 --> 00:26:27,302
你会想念我的 我发誓，你会挂念我的
You're going to miss me. I swear to you, you will miss me.

428
00:26:27,373 --> 00:26:29,136
让我告诉你吧，沙利
Let me tell you something, Shelly.

429
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:32,234
我只是做我该做的 换了你是我也会这样做的！
I do what I'm hired to do... you might do the same.

430
00:26:32,311 --> 00:26:34,176
天啊！ 等一下！
 Jesus. Now wait a second!

431
00:26:35,814 --> 00:26:39,716
我受雇来看着这些生意，分配销售任务
I'm hired to watch the leads, to marshal my sales force.

432
00:26:39,785 --> 00:26:41,912
上头制订策略和规矩 我照章执行而已
I'm given a policy. My job is to do that.

433
00:26:41,987 --> 00:26:44,046
分配你的销售任务？
Marshal your sales force?

434
00:26:44,123 --> 00:26:46,785
任何人低于某销售量
Anybody falls below a certain mark, I'm directed.

435
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:48,827
我就不能给他额外的好生意
I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.

436
00:26:48,894 --> 00:26:52,853
那他们怎么提升业绩？ 就靠那些垃圾生意？
How do they rise above that mark? With dreck?

437
00:26:52,932 --> 00:26:55,264
靠你给我的这些厕纸一样的东西？
With this toilet paper you're giving me?

438
00:26:55,334 --> 00:26:56,926
你给我一单好生意 
You give me one premium lead...

439
00:26:57,002 --> 00:26:58,697
你知道那值多少钱吗？
Do you know what the premium leads cost?

440
00:26:58,771 --> 00:27:01,035
我知道那值多少钱吗？
Do I know what the premium leads cost?

441
00:27:01,106 --> 00:27:02,539
我知道那值多少
Yeah, I know what they cost.

442
00:27:02,608 --> 00:27:05,839
我出了足够多的钱来取得生意
I generated the sufficient dollar revenue to buy them.

443
00:27:05,911 --> 00:27:08,903
可我没办法把垃圾卖出去！
But I cannot sell shit!

444
00:27:08,981 --> 00:27:11,541
你知道我以前见过这些
Jesus. And I've seen these before, you know.

445
00:27:11,617 --> 00:27:13,551
天啊，现在又看见这些了 农场 
Christ, I saw these back... Homestead...

446
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:15,951
1985，我们向这些 混蛋推销贝威特湖泊
1985, we pitched these cocksuckers Baywater.

447
00:27:16,021 --> 00:27:20,321
他们什么都买不起 他们一文不名
They couldn't buy a fucking toaster. They're broke. They're deadbeats.

448
00:27:20,392 --> 00:27:23,327
给我一些好点的生意吧 不要那些随便凑电话本上找来的
Just give me some leads that don't come out of a phone book.

449
00:27:23,395 --> 00:27:26,091
给我些好点的生意吧 我一定能卖出去的
You give me something hotter than that and I can close it.

450
00:27:26,165 --> 00:27:28,360
我能改变现在这种局面的 现在只是碰上些小麻烦
It's just a streak. I'm gonna turn it around.

451
00:27:28,434 --> 00:27:31,699
嘿，我需要你的帮助
Hey, I need your help.

452
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:36,672
我不能那么做，沙利
I can't do it, Shelly.

453
00:27:42,014 --> 00:27:44,209
约翰…
John...

454
00:27:44,283 --> 00:27:46,945
我私底下给你10%怎么样
I'll give you 10%.

455
00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:49,579
我完成的生意的10%
 Of what? My end... what I close.

456
00:27:49,655 --> 00:27:52,590
给我些好生意 你就能拿到10%的钱
You give me the premium leads, you're in for 10%, what I close.

457
00:27:52,658 --> 00:27:54,523
你卖不出去怎么办？ 我一定卖的出去的
 And what if you don't close? I will.

458
00:27:54,593 --> 00:27:56,618
你卖不出呢？ 我一定卖的出去的
 What if you don't close? I will close.

459
00:27:56,695 --> 00:27:58,788
万一你卖不出去呢？
What if you don't, you understand?

460
00:27:58,864 --> 00:28:01,765
那我就完了 你以为只有你才有家人要养吗？
Then I'm fucked. You think you're the only guy with a family?

461
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:03,563
你明白我在说什么吗？ 约翰 
 You see what I'm saying? John...

462
00:28:03,636 --> 00:28:05,900
我帮了你忙，你却卖不出去的话 那我也会被炒掉的
I step out and you don't close, then it's my job.

463
00:28:05,971 --> 00:28:07,939
然后我就完了 我一定能完成的！
 Then I'm fucked. I will close!

464
00:28:08,007 --> 00:28:10,737
想想，10%，约翰 你知道我可以再次红起来的
Now, 10%John... I can get hot, you know that.

465
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:13,369
最近你的业绩很糟 去他妈的！
 Not lately you can't. That's defeatist... fuck it!

466
00:28:13,445 --> 00:28:16,380
站在我这边.帮我做点什么吧
Go with me. Get on my side and let's do something.

467
00:28:16,448 --> 00:28:19,110
你想运作这办公室？ 你听到那家伙怎么说的
You want to run this office? You heard what the man said...

468
00:28:19,184 --> 00:28:21,618
“进攻” 一起做点什么吧
"Attack." Let's do something.

469
00:28:21,687 --> 00:28:26,090
怎么样？ 我要20%
 Huh? 20%.

470
00:28:27,493 --> 00:28:30,121
好吧 另外五十美元买一单生意
 All right. And 50 bucks a lead.

471
00:28:30,195 --> 00:28:32,186
不成吗？ 哦！
 No? Oh!

472
00:28:39,071 --> 00:28:40,834
妈的
Oh, shit.

473
00:28:54,286 --> 00:28:58,586
听着，我有话要跟你说
Listen... I got to talk to you.

474
00:28:58,657 --> 00:29:03,526
给我一秒钟吧 我比你年纪大
Permit me to do this a second. I'm older than you.

475
00:29:03,595 --> 00:29:06,928
一个人需要有好的名声
A man acquires a reputation on the street.

476
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:09,729
当他高高在上时做了什么 其他时候又做了什么
What he does when he's up, what he does at other times...

477
00:29:09,802 --> 00:29:12,999
我说10%，你说不行 你说20%，我说成交
I said, "10," you said, "No." You said, "20," I said, "Fine."

478
00:29:13,072 --> 00:29:16,473
现在你要放弃50美元的生意
Now you want to throw this 50 buck thing in.

479
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:21,411
约翰，一桩好的交易得让当事人都 
John, a good deal... has got to be one where both parties...

480
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,711
好，20%，每张单子50元，成交
Okay, okay, okay, fine... 20%, 50 bucks a lead. It's done.

481
00:29:24,783 --> 00:29:26,683
一起去赚钱吧
Let's go out. We make some money.

482
00:29:26,752 --> 00:29:29,380
我还有很多帐单要付 我今晚要两单生意
I got bills to pay. I want two sits tonight

483
00:29:29,455 --> 00:29:32,117
我要格兰加利的好生意，两单
and I want the good leads... the Glengarry leads... two.

484
00:29:32,191 --> 00:29:34,386
约翰，我会把它们都卖掉的
Two, John, because I am going to close 'em both.

485
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,258
已经没有回头的余地了
It's a long road with no turning, pally.

486
00:29:37,329 --> 00:29:40,196
走吧
Huh? Okay. Now, let's go.

487
00:29:40,265 --> 00:29:42,859
我得回办公室拿单子
I've got to go back to the office to get 'em.

488
00:29:42,935 --> 00:29:46,837
好的，一起去吧 我不是说了吗，约翰
Go on, let's go. This is what I was saying, John.

489
00:29:46,905 --> 00:29:49,601
只要有人帮你一把就能渡过难关
All you need, a little boost, you turn a streak around.

490
00:29:49,675 --> 00:29:52,701
我说的对吗？
Am I right? Good, huh? Huh, good?

491
00:29:52,778 --> 00:29:55,212
什么？
What?

492
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,044
什么？ 两单生意，一百元
 What? Two leads, 100 bucks.

493
00:29:58,117 --> 00:30:00,210
现在就要给？ 对，不然你以为什么时候给？
 Now? Now, yes. When?

494
00:30:00,285 --> 00:30:02,549
妈的，约翰 我希望我可以
 Shit, John. I wish I could.

495
00:30:02,621 --> 00:30:05,317
你这该死的混蛋
You fucking asshole.

496
00:30:05,391 --> 00:30:08,656
我现在没那么多钱 
I don't have it... I don't...

497
00:30:08,727 --> 00:30:11,059
我会明早拿到办公室给你的
I'll bring it in the office in the morning.

498
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,530
我还会带着合约一起来的 不行
 I'll be coming with the sales. Nope.

499
00:30:15,934 --> 00:30:18,664
我真不敢相信
I can't fucking believe this.

500
00:30:18,737 --> 00:30:22,070
那好吧，这里是…
All right, here's...

501
00:30:22,141 --> 00:30:23,972
20…30 
20... 30, and...

502
00:30:24,042 --> 00:30:27,603
这里是三十 我明早给你剩下的
Jesus, here's the 30. I'll bring the rest in tomorrow.

503
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,874
以主的名义，你就帮帮我吧！
We got to do this, huh, pal? For Christ's sake!

504
00:30:29,948 --> 00:30:31,779
不行
No.

505
00:30:33,018 --> 00:30:37,785
我的女儿… 我不能那么做，沙利
 My daughter... I can't do it, Shelly.

506
00:30:37,856 --> 00:30:40,916
我有事要告诉你，就是不久以前的事
I got to tell you something. It wasn't so long ago,

507
00:30:40,993 --> 00:30:44,895
我打电话给默里 替你找到了这份工作
I'd pick up the phone and call Murray... I got your job.

508
00:30:44,963 --> 00:30:48,364
“默里，就帮帮那孩子” “沙利，他走了”
"Murray, the kid is burning my ass." "Shelly, he's gone."

509
00:30:48,434 --> 00:30:53,235
我吃完午饭回来你已经走了
You are gone before I'm back from lunch.

510
00:30:53,305 --> 00:30:55,034
我为了你请他到百慕大旅行
Bought him a trip to Bermuda once.

511
00:30:55,107 --> 00:30:56,938
我要走了 好吧，嘿
 I've got to go. All right, hey.

512
00:30:57,009 --> 00:31:01,537
再给我两单老的生意
Give me... I'll take two more of the old leads.

513
00:31:01,613 --> 00:31:04,207
今天我给了两单了 一单明显是垃圾，约翰！
 I gave you two today. One is a bust out, John!

514
00:31:04,283 --> 00:31:06,274
还有单人不在家！ 沙利 
 The other ain't home! Shelly...

515
00:31:06,351 --> 00:31:07,477
我向你保证，我有打电话去
I promise you, I've been on the phone... I know.

516
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,214
今天没新的生意了 每天两单，你拿到你的生意了
No more leads today... two per day. You've got yours.

517
00:31:09,288 --> 00:31:11,313
好吧
All right.

518
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,790
行了吗？ 行了
 All right? Sure.

519
00:31:18,997 --> 00:31:23,491
这事明天再说吧
We will do that... other thing.

520
00:31:25,204 --> 00:31:28,367
我想我把钱包忘在房间里了
I guess I left my wallet in my room.

521
00:31:34,513 --> 00:31:37,539
全他妈的是混蛋
Deadbeats. Deadbeats, all of 'em.

522
00:31:37,616 --> 00:31:41,313
是我的错 我不应该接那些生意
My mistake. I shouldn't have took the leads.

523
00:31:41,386 --> 00:31:43,684
你不得不接 是吗？为什么？
 You had to. Yeah? Why?

524
00:31:43,755 --> 00:31:45,985
为了 为了回到销售榜上
 To get on the... To get on the board, yeah.

525
00:31:46,058 --> 00:31:48,151
我能怎么做？卖给医生吗？
How am I gonna get on the board trying to sell a doctor?

526
00:31:48,227 --> 00:31:49,990
照旧，再加两份巧克力圈
Two regular, two chocolate donuts.

527
00:31:50,062 --> 00:31:53,122
只会给我那些老的垃圾生意 不要试着去卖给印第安人
Give me the same thing to go. And don't try and sell an Indian.

528
00:31:53,198 --> 00:31:54,893
我从不尝试卖给印第安人
I will never try to sell an Indian.

529
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:57,231
你有见过这些名字吗？“柏特”？
These names come up... you ever get 'em... "Patel"?

530
00:31:57,302 --> 00:32:00,271
你有拿到过吗？ 我想我拿到过一次
 You ever get 'em? I think I had one once.

531
00:32:00,339 --> 00:32:02,637
你拿过的话一定有印象 “柏特”
You had one, you'd know it... "Patel."

532
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:04,369
他们会一直找你
They keep coming up. I don't know.

533
00:32:04,443 --> 00:32:06,775
他们喜欢和经纪谈天 他们太寂寞了
They like to talk to salesmen. They're lonely.

534
00:32:06,845 --> 00:32:09,575
他们喜欢觉得自己高人一等 却从来不买任何东西
They like to feel superior... never bought a fucking thing.

535
00:32:09,648 --> 00:32:12,242
我不清楚 医生，律师，印弟安人
I don't know. Come down the line...

536
00:32:12,317 --> 00:32:16,777
都属于这一类 日子真难过
doctors, lawyers, Indians... times are tight. It's tight.

537
00:32:16,855 --> 00:32:21,349
压力太大了 一个人不能只知道工作
Pressure's just too great. Man can't work all of 'em.

538
00:32:21,426 --> 00:32:25,157
我得走进去，和这些混蛋打交道 或者不吃午餐
You go in the door... I got to close this fucker or I don't eat lunch,

539
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:28,961
不然就赢不到那卡迪拉克 我们工作太卖力了，乔治
or I don't win a Cadillac. We work too hard, George.

540
00:32:31,169 --> 00:32:36,436
还记得我们推销根罗农场的时候吗？
Remember when we were... when we were selling Glen Ross Farms?

541
00:32:36,508 --> 00:32:38,772
我们不是推销过吗？
Didn't we sell a bunch of that?

542
00:32:38,844 --> 00:32:41,005
他们便来了 他们把一切都弄糟了
 They came in... They fucked it up.

543
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:43,070
没错 他们杀了所有的鹅，现在…
 They did. They killed the goose. And now...

544
00:32:43,148 --> 00:32:45,446
我们就困死在这里 被这些该死的东西困死
 We're stuck with this... Stuck with this fucking shit.

545
00:32:45,517 --> 00:32:47,144
他妈的
 This shit. It's too...

546
00:32:47,219 --> 00:32:49,483
没错 你真不斯文
 It is. You get a bad month...

547
00:32:49,555 --> 00:32:52,991
他们把你放在销售竞争榜上
they put you on this board. Some contest board.

548
00:32:53,058 --> 00:32:55,526
这是不好的 对客户来说是不好
 It's not right. It's not right to the customers.

549
00:32:55,594 --> 00:32:57,892
我知道，但 当我还是小孩时学到一个道理
I know, it's... hey. What did I learn as a kid on Western?

550
00:32:59,598 --> 00:33:03,967
不要向一个人卖一辆车就满足了 而要他十五年买五辆车
Don't sell a guy one car. Sell him five cars over 15 years.

551
00:33:04,036 --> 00:33:05,765
说的对 没错
 That's right. You're goddamn right, it's right.

552
00:33:05,837 --> 00:33:08,806
那些家伙走进来，乱说一气 我知道我该怎么做
Guys come in... "Oh, the blah, blah, blah. I know what I'll do.

553
00:33:08,874 --> 00:33:11,274
我会出门，打劫所有瞎子 然后逃去阿根廷
I'll go out and rob everybody blind and go to Argentina

554
00:33:11,343 --> 00:33:13,208
因为以前从没有人这样想过
'cause nobody ever thought of this before."

555
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:16,145
他们杀了所有的鹅 那人一辈子都在不停的工作 
So they kill the goose and the man's worked all his life...

556
00:33:16,214 --> 00:33:18,114
没错 最后也只有退到自己的靴子里去
 That's right. He's got to cower in his boots...

557
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,276
没错，靴子…
Boots, yes...

558
00:33:19,351 --> 00:33:22,684
就因为有些混蛋说 “卖出一万，就可以拿到一套牛扒刀具”
For some fucking "Sell 10,000, win the steak knives."

559
00:33:22,754 --> 00:33:24,654
你怎么做？ 你可以做什么？
 What do you do? What can you do?

560
00:33:24,723 --> 00:33:27,123
没有那些生意你可以做什么？
What can you do if you don't have the leads?

561
00:33:27,192 --> 00:33:29,922
如果没那样该死的生意！
If you do not have the goddamn leads!

562
00:33:30,128 --> 00:33:33,029
史先生吗？ 我是沙利赖芬
Mr. Spannel? Sheldon Levene.

563
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:35,123
我早前跟你太太通过电话了
I was speaking to your wife earlier?

564
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,065
进来吧
Come in.

565
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,531
雨下的真大啊 对
 "Cats and dogs," huh? Yeah.

566
00:33:40,606 --> 00:33:43,234
雨下的可真大
Oh, "cats and dogs."

567
00:33:45,544 --> 00:33:48,342
你一定很喜欢钓鱼吧
Oh, I see you're interested in fishing.

568
00:33:48,413 --> 00:33:51,109
没错 我喜欢一个人钓鱼，有好几年了
 Yeah. I've fished myself... many years.

569
00:33:51,183 --> 00:33:54,016
威斯康星产的 真棒啊
Muskee, Wisconsin. Ooh, a beauty.

570
00:33:56,355 --> 00:33:58,755
史太太呢？ 去参加家长委员会了
 Where's the missus? Out at the PTA.

571
00:33:58,824 --> 00:34:00,689
你来有何贵干？
 Ahh. What was this in reference...?

572
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:02,818
我跟你太太早前在电话里谈过
I spoke to your wife earlier on the phone.

573
00:34:02,894 --> 00:34:04,794
我是为了尼奥牧场的事来城里的
I called, I'm in town with Rio Rancho.

574
00:34:04,863 --> 00:34:08,060
哦，我想起来了 她说过你有奖品要给我们
Yes, I'm sorry. She said you had some sort of award?

575
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:11,398
我和我公司的人谈过
Yes, I was speaking to the people in my sales organization...

576
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:15,236
我是指负责这一区的同事 史先生 
my representatives in this area... and Mr. Spannel...

577
00:34:15,307 --> 00:34:18,140
你叫拉里对吗？ 我可以这么称呼你吗？
your name is Larry. Mind if I call you Larry?

578
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:21,907
好的，拉里 我们有个顾问
All right, Larry. We had a consultant,

579
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:25,108
他给我这样一个优惠
and he made me... he made me an offer.

580
00:34:25,183 --> 00:34:28,744
他给了我二十三万来做销售计划
He offered me $230,000 to promote a sales plan...

581
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:33,348
向大众宣传我们在尼奥牧场的投资机会
to present investment opportunities in Rio Rancho to the public.

582
00:34:33,425 --> 00:34:36,690
我说，我可以为你省下那二十三万
Well, I said, "Hell, let me save you the 230,

583
00:34:36,762 --> 00:34:39,856
然后将这些钱留给投资者
and pass the savings along to the investor."

584
00:34:39,931 --> 00:34:43,094
那家伙马上问我可以怎样做？
My people immediately said, "Whoa, how do you do that?

585
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:46,137
不靠电视宣传，不靠杂志广告
How can you present investment opportunities

586
00:34:46,204 --> 00:34:48,399
怎么吸引投资者？
without television, without magazine ads?"

587
00:34:48,473 --> 00:34:50,373
我说，你就这样做
I said, "You take something this good,

588
00:34:50,442 --> 00:34:52,672
你去找以前投资过的人
you go to a man... has invested in the past...

589
00:34:52,744 --> 00:34:56,612
把这笔钱作为回扣给他
you go to him direct and offer the money to him... rebate.

590
00:34:56,682 --> 00:34:59,810
不要把钱给狗屁推销专家
And don't give it to this expert."

591
00:35:01,253 --> 00:35:03,278
你来是向我推销土地的？
So you're here to sell me some land?

592
00:35:03,355 --> 00:35:05,550
不，我不是来向你推销土地的
No, I wouldn't try to sell you...

593
00:35:05,624 --> 00:35:08,957
这些就交给房产经纪还有 那些有兴趣买地的人去做吧
I leave that to the salesmen and people who want to own land.

594
00:35:09,027 --> 00:35:11,791
我认为有些东西
I think something has to be fed,

595
00:35:11,863 --> 00:35:14,798
总得有人去打理 但不要在它上面投资
watered and painted, but don't invest in it.

596
00:35:14,866 --> 00:35:17,391
这座右铭让我受益非浅
That motto has stood me in good stead.

597
00:35:17,469 --> 00:35:19,664
先生 叫我沙利吧
 Mister... Just call me Shelly.

598
00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:21,968
我从不介意亲切点的
I have never been afraid of familiarity.

599
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,065
我要出门去接我太太了
I'm walking out the door. I've got to pick up my wife at the...

600
00:35:24,142 --> 00:35:26,542
开我的车去吧 我们一起去接她
Let's take my car. We'll pick her up together.

601
00:35:26,611 --> 00:35:28,841
跟她在电话里谈过后真想见见她
Spoke to the little woman on the phone... can't wait to meet her.

602
00:35:28,914 --> 00:35:30,711
我们还要去亲戚那里
No, we're going over to our relatives'.

603
00:35:30,782 --> 00:35:33,444
她没提起过 我很抱歉她肯定是忘了
 She didn't say anything about that. I'm sure she forgot.

604
00:35:33,518 --> 00:35:36,146
我还要搭飞机去佛罗里达 如果耽误了你的事，我很抱歉
 I'm on a plane to Florida... I'm sorry if we put you out.

605
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:38,746
拉里，你没麻烦到我 我只是在想
You didn't put me out. I'm just trying to think, Larry.

606
00:35:38,824 --> 00:35:41,384
你知道，我只挑选了你一个人
You know, that's the only parcel that I've got.

607
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,190
你知道我会怎么做？ 我会回去打开电脑
You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go back to the computer,

608
00:35:44,262 --> 00:35:47,425
再选另一个人 我们也可以跟你的亲友们谈谈的
I'm gonna pull another one, and we're gonna speak to your relatives, too.

609
00:35:47,499 --> 00:35:49,865
不用了 你是个大忙人，我也是啊
 No, no, no. C'mon, you're a busy man, so am I.

610
00:35:49,935 --> 00:35:52,802
天啊，我是在送礼啊
My God, I'm in the act of giving a gift away.

611
00:35:52,871 --> 00:35:55,806
我不想买地 我不想在土地上投资
Look, I don't want to buy land. I don't want to invest in land.

612
00:35:55,874 --> 00:36:00,436
我没钱投资 她没告诉我就接了电话
I have nothing. She took the call without my knowledge.

613
00:36:00,512 --> 00:36:02,776
我没有生意要做
I have no business that I wish to transact.

614
00:36:02,848 --> 00:36:04,679
我不是想告诉你怎么对待你太太
I don't want to tell you how to handle your wife.

615
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:08,584
我太太去年填了张表 然后去年不停的有人骚扰我们
My wife filled in a form, and we have been plagued for the last year...

616
00:36:08,653 --> 00:36:11,622
我就是来帮你解决这种状况的
That's the situation I'm trying to alleviate, Larry.

617
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,487
不，不 你明白吗？
No, no. Do you understand?

618
00:36:14,693 --> 00:36:16,558
谢谢，我不明白
Thank you. No.

619
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,540
诺马 他才不在乎呢 他是不在乎
 Roma, man... he don't care. He don't care.

620
00:36:34,613 --> 00:36:38,049
他有好的生意 光明的前途，高高在上
He's sitting on top of the world. He's got good leads, good prospects.

621
00:36:38,116 --> 00:36:40,516
销量，销量 销量竞赛
 Sales, sales. Sales contests.

622
00:36:40,585 --> 00:36:43,383
我就是要说这个 日子越来越难过，他们把你拒之门外
 That's what I'm saying. Times turn hard, they bounce you out.

623
00:36:43,455 --> 00:36:45,480
任何自信也不留给你
If they bounce you with no confidence...

624
00:36:45,557 --> 00:36:48,151
那正是我对你所说的
That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying to you.

625
00:36:53,498 --> 00:36:55,989
如果你这次又失败了
If they get you on a bad beat...

626
00:36:56,067 --> 00:36:58,535
就得出去另找份新的工作
and you got to go out there, get a new job...

627
00:36:58,603 --> 00:37:00,366
可是你已经没有 没有自信 
 With no... With no confidence...

628
00:37:00,405 --> 00:37:01,963
对
Yes.

629
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:06,272
我可以告诉你最困难的是什么 就是很难停止想象自己是个狗奴才
I'll tell you what the hard part is... to stop thinking like a goddamn slave.

630
00:37:06,344 --> 00:37:09,836
你说欧洲的纳粹党 “如果他们走进我的屋子” 
You say the Nazis in Europe... "If they came in my door"...

631
00:37:09,915 --> 00:37:12,281
胡说，重要的是现在 你现在该做什么？
bullshit, the time is now. What do you do now?

632
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,682
有人在你脸上撒尿 该死的 
Some guy pissing in your face. Cocksucker...

633
00:37:14,753 --> 00:37:17,187
想打烂你的饭碗
wants to break your rice bowl.

634
00:37:17,255 --> 00:37:20,850
去他妈的米奇和默里 去他妈的！
Mitch and Murray, fuck you. What I say... fuck you!

635
00:37:20,926 --> 00:37:23,724
只会坐在好生意上面
Sitting on the good leads.

636
00:37:23,795 --> 00:37:26,628
乔治，我们是真正的男人
George, we're men here.

637
00:37:28,033 --> 00:37:29,227
对
Yes.

638
00:37:29,301 --> 00:37:33,237
我会告诉你最困难的是什么
And I'll tell you... I'll tell you what the hard part is.

639
00:37:33,305 --> 00:37:35,899
什么？ 起步的时候最困难
 What? Starting up.

640
00:37:35,974 --> 00:37:38,704
站起身来 不再花时间说这些废话
Standing up. Breaking free of this bullshit,

641
00:37:38,777 --> 00:37:42,474
不再受某人奴役，就因为他高高在上
this enslavement to some guy, 'cause he's got the upper hand.

642
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:48,185
这就是不同之处 听我说，乔治
This is the difference... listen to me, George.

643
00:37:48,253 --> 00:37:50,414
现在谢利格拉夫自己做生意了
Now Jerry Graff went into business for himself.

644
00:37:50,488 --> 00:37:56,085
他说“我要靠自己的” 他现在自由了，你明白我的意思吗？
He said, "I'm going on my own." And he was free, you understand me?

645
00:37:57,295 --> 00:38:00,287
我会告诉你应该怎么做人
I'll tell you... I'll tell you what somebody should do.

646
00:38:03,335 --> 00:38:04,324
什么？
What?

647
00:38:04,402 --> 00:38:07,030
应该有人站出来反击
Somebody should stand up and strike back.

648
00:38:07,105 --> 00:38:09,437
应该有人对他们做点什么
Somebody should do something to them.

649
00:38:09,507 --> 00:38:11,737
你说什么？ 做些回报他们的事情
 What? Something to pay them back.

650
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,641
要让米奇和默里吃点苦头
Someone should hurt them, Mitch and Murray.

651
00:38:13,712 --> 00:38:15,407
吃点苦头？ 对
 Somebody should hurt them? Yeah.

652
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,345
怎么做？ 我们应该从内部入手
 How? Someone should do something

653
00:38:17,415 --> 00:38:19,144
让他们吃点苦头 什么？
 to hurt them where they live. What?

654
00:38:19,217 --> 00:38:22,414
应该去打劫办公室 那正是我要说的
Someone should rob the office. That's what I'm saying.

655
00:38:22,487 --> 00:38:25,923
如果我们把办公室弄的乱七八糟
If we were that kind of guy to hold up the joint and trash it,

656
00:38:25,991 --> 00:38:29,051
看起来就象是打劫 我们拿走那些该死的生意
it looks like robbery, we take the leads out of the files

657
00:38:29,127 --> 00:38:31,061
然后到谢利格拉夫那里去
and we go to Jerry Graff.

658
00:38:31,129 --> 00:38:34,997
我们拿走格兰加利的那些生意！
And we take the fucking Glengarry leads! Huh?

659
00:38:37,836 --> 00:38:41,101
黎波先生？ 我是沙利赖芬
Yeah, Mr. Nyborg? Ah, Mr. Nyborg, Sheldon Levene.

660
00:38:41,172 --> 00:38:43,766
我早前跟你太太谈过 没错
I was speaking to your wife earlier. That's right.

661
00:38:43,842 --> 00:38:47,471
我想跟你谈谈那奖品的事
I'd like to speak to you about awarding you your prize.

662
00:38:47,545 --> 00:38:49,536
我们公司的财政年度快要结束了
We're coming to the end of our fiscal year,

663
00:38:49,614 --> 00:38:52,310
我希望能在那以前 
I'd really like to get it off the books before...

664
00:38:52,384 --> 00:38:55,376
对，给处理好的物业的奖品
yes, the prize for Consolidated Properties.

665
00:38:55,453 --> 00:38:57,978
你要求的尼奥农场的资料
The information you requested on Rio Rancho.

666
00:38:58,056 --> 00:39:01,253
我只能在城里待 让我看看
Now, I'm in town only for... well, let me see.

667
00:39:01,326 --> 00:39:04,295
我想我可以留到今晚
I suppose I could swing by tonight. Yes. Uh huh.

668
00:39:04,362 --> 00:39:06,956
你认为什么时候见面比较方便？
When do you think it might be more convenient?

669
00:39:06,998 --> 00:39:09,592
我说了，我可以留到今晚
As I said, I could swing by tonight...

670
00:39:09,668 --> 00:39:12,159
当然，你先和你太太商量一下吧
well, of course, you speak to your wife.

671
00:39:12,237 --> 00:39:14,171
格雷斯，帮我订张
Grace, I'm gonna need

672
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:16,799
头等舱机票 还有护照和一万元现金
a first class seat, passport, 10,000 in cash,

673
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:19,139
和协议书一起
put that with the negotiable papers, if you would.

674
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:23,408
放在传真机上 喂？
And put me on the telex hookup... yes?

675
00:39:23,481 --> 00:39:26,973
你看你太太什么时候会回来？
Well, when do you think Mrs. Nyborg might be back?

676
00:39:27,485 --> 00:39:30,477
所有的车厢都有股臭味
All train compartments smell vaguely of shit.

677
00:39:30,555 --> 00:39:33,752
你不在意的话就闻不到
It gets so you don't mind it.

678
00:39:33,825 --> 00:39:36,988
那是我遇到的最糟糕的事情
That's the worst thing that I can confess.

679
00:39:37,062 --> 00:39:39,656
你知道我到那里要多久吗？ 很长时间
You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.

680
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:45,836
你要死的时候便会后悔 还有很多没做过的事
When you die you're gonna regret the things you don't do.

681
00:39:45,904 --> 00:39:48,998
你以为自己很怪 让我告诉你
You think you're queer? I'm gonna tell you something.

682
00:39:49,074 --> 00:39:52,510
我们全都很怪 你以为自己是贼？那又怎么样？
We're all queer. You think you're a thief? So what?

683
00:39:52,577 --> 00:39:55,171
你为中产阶级的道德感到迷惑？
You get befuddled by a middle class morality?

684
00:39:55,246 --> 00:39:57,180
少来这套了
Get shut of it. Shut it out.

685
00:39:57,248 --> 00:40:01,344
你骗了你太太
You cheat on your wife, you did it. Live with it.

686
00:40:01,419 --> 00:40:04,684
你跟小女孩上床，没什么大不了的
You fuck little girls, so be it.

687
00:40:04,756 --> 00:40:08,522
世上有绝对的道德吗？ 也许有吧
There's an absolute morality? Maybe.

688
00:40:08,593 --> 00:40:11,221
然后又怎么样？
And then what?

689
00:40:11,296 --> 00:40:14,823
如果你认为有，就照做啊
If you think there is, go ahead, be that thing.

690
00:40:15,033 --> 00:40:17,866
坏人死后要下地狱？ 我不这么想
Bad people go to hell? I don't think so.

691
00:40:17,936 --> 00:40:19,870
你怎么想就怎么做吧
You think that, act that way.

692
00:40:19,938 --> 00:40:26,343
世上有地狱吗？ 有我也不会住进去
A hell exists on earth? Yes. I won't live in it.

693
00:40:26,411 --> 00:40:28,402
那就是我
That's me.

694
00:40:33,118 --> 00:40:36,986
你有试过在垃圾堆中待过 然后觉得就象睡了十二个钟头？
Did you ever take a dump, made you feel like you slept for 12 hours?

695
00:40:37,055 --> 00:40:39,717
我有没有呢？ 对
 Did I...? Yes.

696
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:43,283
我不知道 或者尝尝小便？
 I don't know. Or a piss?

697
00:40:47,665 --> 00:40:50,634
再丰盛的大餐也会在回忆中淡去
Great meals fade in reflection.

698
00:40:50,702 --> 00:40:53,398
所有事都这样 你知道为什么吗？
Everything else gains. Do you know why?

699
00:40:53,471 --> 00:40:56,838
因为世上只有食物 我们每天吃进去的东西
'Cause it's only food. This shit we put in us,

700
00:40:56,908 --> 00:40:59,342
让我们有力气 只是食物
keeps us going... it's only food.

701
00:41:00,578 --> 00:41:02,910
也许你曾有过美妙的作爱
The great fucks you may have had,

702
00:41:02,981 --> 00:41:04,915
你还记得她们吗？
what do you remember about them?

703
00:41:04,983 --> 00:41:09,044
我又还记得些什么？ 对
 What do I remember? Yeah.

704
00:41:10,855 --> 00:41:12,584
我不知道 对我来说
I don't know. For me,

705
00:41:12,657 --> 00:41:16,115
我会说大概不是高潮
I'm saying what it is, it's probably not the orgasm.

706
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:21,595
或许是手臂的紧紧拥抱
Some broad's forearm on your neck,

707
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:26,103
也许是她的一个眼神 还有她的叫声
something her eyes did. There was this sound she made.

708
00:41:27,305 --> 00:41:30,103
我告诉你
Or it's me in the... I'm telling you...

709
00:41:30,175 --> 00:41:34,111
第二天早上我躺在床上 她端给我杯牛奶咖啡
I'm in bed the next day, she brought me caf?au lait,

710
00:41:34,179 --> 00:41:37,615
还给我一支烟 我的心中感到很满足
gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete.

711
00:41:37,682 --> 00:41:39,206
恩？
Eh?

712
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:43,651
我想说的是，什么是生活？
What I'm saying, what is our life?

713
00:41:45,356 --> 00:41:49,053
我们的生活就是向前看，或是向后
Our life is looking forward or it's looking back.

714
00:41:49,127 --> 00:41:52,961
就那样 那就是我们的生活
That's it. That's our life.

715
00:41:53,031 --> 00:41:55,625
那时刻在哪儿？
Where's the moment?

716
00:42:00,138 --> 00:42:03,107
我们究竟在害怕什么？
And what is it we're so afraid of?

717
00:42:03,174 --> 00:42:05,074
失败还有什么？
Loss. What else?

718
00:42:05,143 --> 00:42:10,274
是银行倒闭，我们生病了 或是我太太飞机失事了？
The bank closes, we get sick, my wife died on a plane?

719
00:42:11,749 --> 00:42:14,946
或是股票市场崩盘？
The stock market collapsed? What of these things happen?

720
00:42:15,019 --> 00:42:18,113
没有一件事发生过 但我们却不断的担心为什么？
None of them. We worry anyway. Why?

721
00:42:20,492 --> 00:42:21,481
我们从它们那里可以得到什么？
What could we get for them?

722
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:24,289
什么？ 我是说生意
 For them? For the leads.

723
00:42:24,362 --> 00:42:26,387
从那些生意里我们可得到什么利益？
What could we get for the leads?

724
00:42:26,464 --> 00:42:30,833
我不知道 十块或许十五块一单吧
I don't know. 10 bucks a throw. 15 maybe. I don't know.

725
00:42:32,403 --> 00:42:35,065
你是在说生意吗？ 如果有人拿了这些生意
For the leads, you're saying? Say somebody took them,

726
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:38,268
到谢利格拉夫那里去呢？ 我们手上有多少生意？
 went to Jerry Graff? Yeah. How many leads do we have?

727
00:42:38,343 --> 00:42:39,674
你是指格兰加利的生意？ 最好的那些？
The Glengarry? The premium leads?

728
00:42:39,744 --> 00:42:42,941
我猜应该有500单吧 500单生意
I've got to think they've got 500. Say 500 leads.

729
00:42:43,014 --> 00:42:46,279
你是说有人会 把那些生意卖给格拉夫？
You're saying a fella could take those leads and sell them to Graff?

730
00:42:46,351 --> 00:42:48,615
卖给格拉夫 对，没错
The leads to Graff. Yes. I was saying... yeah.

731
00:42:48,686 --> 00:42:51,280
有人可以拿走这些生意 就象拿走别的东西那样
A guy could take... like anything else, it seems to me,

732
00:42:51,356 --> 00:42:53,881
谈妥后就卖掉它们
that is negotiable, a guy could sell them.

733
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:57,359
你怎么知道格拉夫会买？ 因为我曾为他工作
 How do you know he'd buy them? Because I worked for him.

734
00:42:57,428 --> 00:43:01,125
你没有跟他说？ 没有你什么意思？
 You didn't talk to him? No. What do you mean?

735
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:03,292
你问我和他提起过这事吗？ 对
 Did I talk to him about this? Yeah.

736
00:43:03,368 --> 00:43:05,666
你只是说说而已 还是我们在正式谈这事？
Are you just talking about this, or are we just talking about it?

737
00:43:05,737 --> 00:43:08,171
只是随便说说而已 当做个主意谈谈？
 Just speaking about it. Speaking about it as an idea?

738
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:10,332
对 我们并没有在正式谈这事
 Yes. We're not actually talking about it.

739
00:43:10,408 --> 00:43:13,172
对，没有 我们没有正式谈论这劫案
 No. Talking about it as a robbery.

740
00:43:13,244 --> 00:43:16,008
劫案？不
As a robbery? No.

741
00:43:18,449 --> 00:43:20,679
嘿
 Well... Hey.

742
00:43:20,752 --> 00:43:23,550
你并没有跟格利夫谈过？
So all this... you didn't actually call Graff?

743
00:43:23,621 --> 00:43:26,055
对不对？ 没有和他谈过
 You didn't talk to him? Not actually, no.

744
00:43:26,124 --> 00:43:28,388
没和他谈过？ 没有
 You didn't? No, not actually.

745
00:43:28,459 --> 00:43:30,051
你没有？ 我说什么了？
 Did you? What did I say?

746
00:43:30,128 --> 00:43:31,925
你说什么了？ 我说:实际上没有谈过
 What did you say? I said, "Not actually".

747
00:43:31,996 --> 00:43:34,157
那又怎么样，乔治？ 我们只是说说罢了
Fuck you care, George? We're just talking.

748
00:43:34,232 --> 00:43:35,563
是吗？ 是的
 We are? Yes.

749
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,001
因为那样做是犯罪 没错，是抢劫
 Because it's a crime. Robbery. That's right.

750
00:43:40,838 --> 00:43:42,703
这是犯罪
It is a crime.

751
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:48,211
但也非常安全 你实际上是在讲真的
 It's also very safe. You're actually talking about this.

752
00:43:48,279 --> 00:43:51,043
没错 你想劫走这些生意
 That's right. You're going to steal the leads.

753
00:43:51,115 --> 00:43:52,548
我有这样说吗？ 你有吗？
 Have I said that? Are you?

754
00:43:52,617 --> 00:43:54,414
我有说吗？ 你有和格拉夫谈过吗？
 Did I say that? Did you talk to Graff?

755
00:43:54,485 --> 00:43:56,077
我怎么说的？ 他怎么说的？
 What did I say? What did he say?

756
00:43:56,154 --> 00:43:57,951
他怎么说的？
What did he say?

757
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:03,252
他会买下那些生意
He'd buy them.

758
00:44:12,136 --> 00:44:14,263
你会去偷 
You're gonna steal...

759
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:17,502
你会去偷格兰加利的那些生意 然后卖给格拉夫？
you're gonna steal the Glengarry leads and sell them to Graff?

760
00:44:17,575 --> 00:44:20,601
对 他肯出多少钱？
 Yes. What's he gonna pay?

761
00:44:20,678 --> 00:44:23,943
他知道有五百单生意 每单十块钱
He figures there's 500 leads, let's say 10 bucks apiece,

762
00:44:24,015 --> 00:44:27,610
那就是每人两千五百块 每人？
 that's $2,500 each. Each?

763
00:44:27,685 --> 00:44:29,619
每人？ 没错，乔治
 "Each"? That's right, George.

764
00:44:29,687 --> 00:44:32,121
你是在说我？ 不，是你和我
 You're saying me? No, you and me.

765
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:36,456
那正是我想说的 你和我一人两千五百块
Yeah. That's exactly what I'm saying. $2,500 apiece.

766
00:44:36,527 --> 00:44:38,825
只要一晚的工作 还能到格拉夫那里工作
You and me for one night's work, and a job with Graff

767
00:44:38,896 --> 00:44:41,660
处理那些好的生意？ 为格拉夫工作？
 working the premium leads. A job with Graff?

768
00:44:41,733 --> 00:44:44,133
我是这么说的吧？ 他会给我份工作？
 Is that what I said? He'd give me a job?

769
00:44:44,202 --> 00:44:46,261
他会照顾你的 对
He could take you on. Yes.

770
00:45:08,993 --> 00:45:10,483
喂？
Hello?

771
00:45:10,561 --> 00:45:12,961
我是直接打我女儿的房间的
I was dialing the direct line to my daughter's room.

772
00:45:13,031 --> 00:45:15,761
我是沙利赖芬 她是在二十 
Sheldon Levene. She's in...

773
00:45:15,833 --> 00:45:20,395
我知道她已睡了 但…当值的护士呢？
well, yeah, I'm sure she's asleep. But... where's the duty nurse?

774
00:45:21,673 --> 00:45:25,006
他们取消了值夜班的护士 那让我和 
They canceled her... well, let me talk...

775
00:45:25,076 --> 00:45:27,067
等等，你是谁？
who am I speaking to?

776
00:45:29,847 --> 00:45:33,112
我明天就会拿钱来
I'll have the money there tomorrow.

777
00:45:33,685 --> 00:45:35,676
这是个重大的决定，乔治
It's a big decision, George.

778
00:45:35,753 --> 00:45:39,120
一个人总要做些决定的
At times a guy has got to make one.

779
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:41,283
这是个重大的决定 也会有大的回报
It's a big decision and it's a big reward.

780
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,692
两千五百块和一份好工作 对于一晚的工作确是个大回报
$2,500 and a job, it's a big reward for one night's work.

781
00:45:44,762 --> 00:45:46,855
对
Yes.

782
00:45:46,931 --> 00:45:49,399
有时候，人会…
Sometimes a guy...

783
00:45:49,467 --> 00:45:51,833
有时人会很想得到回报
sometimes, a man if he wants a reward...

784
00:45:51,903 --> 00:45:54,463
那是决对正确的
That's absolutely right.

785
00:45:54,539 --> 00:45:56,530
他会在某天晚上做某件事
He'll do one thing, one thing on one night.

786
00:45:56,607 --> 00:46:01,169
那是绝对正确的 重要的是这要今晚就做
That's absolutely right. The thing is, it's got to be tonight.

787
00:46:01,245 --> 00:46:02,303
什么？
What?

788
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,371
那些生意单子就不会离开吗？
What, what? The leads ain't going to leave?

789
00:46:04,449 --> 00:46:06,644
他们只是拿这些单子在你面前晃晃
They bring those leads up, wave them under your nose,

790
00:46:06,718 --> 00:46:08,879
明天就会拿回商业区去
tomorrow they take them downtown, parcel them out.

791
00:46:08,953 --> 00:46:11,717
有人要这些生意的单子 他想今晚就拿到手
A guy wants those leads, he's gonna have to get them tonight.

792
00:46:11,789 --> 00:46:14,724
今晚是个关键的晚上 是个好机会
Tonight is the thing. Talk about a chance.

793
00:46:14,792 --> 00:46:16,521
大好机会就在眼前
It's when a chance presents itself.

794
00:46:16,594 --> 00:46:18,221
所以今晚你一定要进去办公室
You got to go in there tonight.

795
00:46:18,296 --> 00:46:19,661
是你 你说什么？
 You. I'm sorry?

796
00:46:19,731 --> 00:46:21,426
你 我
 You. Me?

797
00:46:21,499 --> 00:46:23,558
你要进去办公室 拿到那些生意的单子
You have to go in. You have to get the leads.

798
00:46:23,634 --> 00:46:26,068
为什么是我？ 你总要做些什么的
 I do? It's not something for nothing.

799
00:46:26,137 --> 00:46:29,903
我给你这么个机会 你一定得去，这是你的事
I took you in on this. You have to go. It's your thing.

800
00:46:29,974 --> 00:46:32,135
我已和格拉夫谈好了 我不能亲自去拿
I've made a deal with Graff. I can't go in.

801
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:35,475
我已经说的太多了 我的嘴巴太大了
I've spoken out on this too much. I've got a big mouth.

802
00:46:35,546 --> 00:46:38,572
“该死的生意”，“该死的公司”
"The fucking leads," et cetera, "the tight ass company," blah, blah.

803
00:46:38,649 --> 00:46:41,584
你去格拉夫那里的话他们会知道一切的 他们知道什么？
 They'll know when you go to Graff. What will they know?

804
00:46:41,652 --> 00:46:43,916
会知道我偷了那些生意？ 我没有偷那些生意
That I stole the leads? I didn't steal the leads.

805
00:46:43,988 --> 00:46:46,752
我会去看电影 然后去科摩酒巴
I'm gonna go to the movies. Then I'm gonna have a late drink

806
00:46:46,824 --> 00:46:48,985
和一个朋友喝点酒 戴夫
 at the Como Inn with a friend. Dave.

807
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,357
怎么了？
Yes?

808
00:46:50,428 --> 00:46:52,521
你要我半夜进办公室偷那些生意？
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?

809
00:46:52,597 --> 00:46:53,859
对 不行
 Yes. No.

810
00:46:53,931 --> 00:46:55,523
哦，你行的，乔治 什么意思？
 Oh, yes, George. What does that mean?

811
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:00,060
听好了，我有不在场证据 我会去科摩酒巴喝酒
Listen to this. I have an alibi. I'm going to the Como Inn.

812
00:47:00,138 --> 00:47:02,868
为什么？ 办公室被打劫了
Why? Why? The place gets robbed,

813
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,408
他们会来找我 为什么？因为也许是我干的
they're going to come looking for me. Why? Because I probably did it.

814
00:47:05,476 --> 00:47:07,910
那我问你个问题 你会出卖我吗？
Let me ask you this... are you going to turn me in?

815
00:47:07,979 --> 00:47:09,810
你没被抓住又怎样？
What if you don't get caught?

816
00:47:09,881 --> 00:47:11,371
他们来盘问你，你会出卖我吗？
They come to you, are you going to turn me in?

817
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:13,475
他们为什么会来盘问我？ 他们会盘问每一个人
 Why would they come to me? They're going to come to everybody.

818
00:47:13,551 --> 00:47:15,314
我有什么动机这么做？ 你没有，乔治
 Why would I do it? You wouldn't, George.

819
00:47:15,386 --> 00:47:17,377
所以我才跟你说这事 他们盘问你
That's why I'm talking to you now. They come to you,

820
00:47:17,455 --> 00:47:19,252
你会出卖我吗？ 不会
 are you going to turn me in? No.

821
00:47:19,323 --> 00:47:20,984
你确定？ 确定
 Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure.

822
00:47:21,025 --> 00:47:26,053
乔治… 他们来盘问我
Uh huh. George... when they come to me,

823
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:28,792
如果我得进去偷生意 如果我被抓住
if I have to go in there, and if I get caught...

824
00:47:28,866 --> 00:47:31,699
他们来盘问我… 你不需要亲自去偷的
 they come to me... You don't have to go in.

825
00:47:31,769 --> 00:47:33,634
我一定得进去偷 那是我一定要做的事
I have to go in, see? That's something I have to do.

826
00:47:33,704 --> 00:47:35,763
为什么？ 为什么？
 Why? Why?

827
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,432
你能给我七千五百块吗？
Are you going to give me $7,500?

828
00:47:37,508 --> 00:47:39,738
我还以为总共只有五千块
75? I thought we were splitting five grand.

829
00:47:39,811 --> 00:47:42,803
我撒谎了，你只能拿到两千五 我那份就不用你操心了
I lied, all right? Your end is 25, my end is my own concern.

830
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,849
问题就在我这里 如果他们来找我
Now, stick with me here. If they come to me,

831
00:47:45,917 --> 00:47:48,579
我被抓了，他们会问我谁是同谋
I'm caught, they're going to ask me who were accomplices.

832
00:47:48,653 --> 00:47:50,314
我 没错
 Me. Absolutely.

833
00:47:50,388 --> 00:47:51,685
那太荒谬了
That's ridiculous.

834
00:47:51,722 --> 00:47:53,587
从法律上来说，事实上你是同谋
To the law, you're an accessory before the fact.

835
00:47:53,624 --> 00:47:56,559
我没有说想干的 很幸运，你就是同谋
 I didn't ask to be. Tough luck, because you are.

836
00:47:56,627 --> 00:47:59,255
就因为你告诉我了？ 没错
 Because you told me about it? That's right.

837
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:01,855
你为什么要这样对我，戴夫？
Why are you doing this to me, Dave?

838
00:48:01,933 --> 00:48:04,561
你干吗要这样和我说？ 我不明白
Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.

839
00:48:04,635 --> 00:48:07,866
为什么你要这样做？ 全不关你的事
 Why are you doing this at all? None of your fucking business.

840
00:48:07,939 --> 00:48:09,839
做还是不做 告诉我
Just in or out? You tell me.

841
00:48:09,907 --> 00:48:11,431
不做的话后果自负
You're out, you take the consequences.

842
00:48:11,509 --> 00:48:13,443
是吗？ 没错
 I do? That's right.

843
00:48:13,511 --> 00:48:15,479
为什么会那样？ 因为你听了
 And why is that? Because you listened.

844
00:48:15,847 --> 00:48:17,337
黎波太太什么时候回来？
Well, when will Mrs. Nyborg be back?

845
00:48:17,415 --> 00:48:20,009
我不喜欢这么晚还打电话给你
You know, I hate to keep calling you this late, Bruce,

846
00:48:20,084 --> 00:48:24,214
但我觉得我有责任告诉你 
but I feel a responsibility, I must say. When you have...

847
00:48:25,857 --> 00:48:29,349
他们说“你没有买下，你是租的”
You know, they say, "You don't buy it, you rent it."

848
00:48:29,427 --> 00:48:31,725
哦？ 什么都是租的
 Huh? The thing.

849
00:48:31,796 --> 00:48:36,699
你还留下些什么？
You really... what do you keep?

850
00:48:36,767 --> 00:48:39,565
我是说，什么也没留下
I mean, you don't keep anything, really.

851
00:48:39,637 --> 00:48:42,401
没有 安全感
 No. Security.

852
00:48:42,473 --> 00:48:45,067
安全感
Things. Things.

853
00:48:45,142 --> 00:48:47,542
你知道吗？ 嗯
 You know? Mm hmm.

854
00:48:47,612 --> 00:48:52,208
你试着除去不安全的感觉
It's just... you try to stave off insecurity.

855
00:48:52,283 --> 00:48:53,682
但你做不到
You can't do it.

856
00:48:54,118 --> 00:48:56,211
那正是我想告诉你的
 No. No. That's what I'm telling you.

857
00:48:56,287 --> 00:49:01,554
股票，债券，艺术品 房地产，它们是什么？
Stocks, bonds, objects of art, real estate, what are they?

858
00:49:01,626 --> 00:49:05,062
一个机会 什么机会？赚钱的机会？
An opportunity. To what? To make money?

859
00:49:05,129 --> 00:49:09,065
也许吧输钱的机会？ 也许是吧
Perhaps. To lose money? Perhaps.

860
00:49:09,133 --> 00:49:12,625
去放纵自己，认识自己？ 也许是吧
To indulge and to learn about ourselves? Perhaps.

861
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,797
那又怎么样？这到底是什么？ 它们都是个机会
So fucking what? What is it? They're an opportunity.

862
00:49:15,873 --> 00:49:18,808
它们就是那样 它们是个事件
That's all they are. They're an event.

863
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:22,539
有人走到你跟前，你打电话给他 你递上名片
A guy comes to you, you make a call. You send in a card,

864
00:49:22,613 --> 00:49:25,377
我有些物业我想你会有兴趣看看的
I have these properties I would like for you to see.

865
00:49:25,449 --> 00:49:28,475
这什么意思？ 你想它有什么意思？
What does this mean? What do you want it to mean?

866
00:49:28,553 --> 00:49:30,680
你明白我在说什么吗？
You see what I'm saying?

867
00:49:33,324 --> 00:49:35,724
事情就这样发生了
Things happen to you.

868
00:49:36,994 --> 00:49:39,622
很高兴认识你
Glad I met you.

869
00:49:39,697 --> 00:49:41,392
我也很高兴认识你，詹姆士
I'm glad I met you, James.

870
00:49:43,534 --> 00:49:46,162
我想给你看些东西
I want to show you something.

871
00:49:46,237 --> 00:49:48,762
你可能会有兴趣，也许不会
It may mean something to you, it may not.

872
00:49:48,839 --> 00:49:51,672
我不知道 我再也不知道
I don't know. I don't know anymore.

873
00:49:54,445 --> 00:49:57,505
那是什么？ 佛罗里达
What is that? Florida.

874
00:49:57,582 --> 00:50:00,415
格兰加利高地 佛罗里达
Glengarry Highlands. Florida.

875
00:50:00,484 --> 00:50:03,476
废话 也许那是对的
Bullshit. And maybe that's true.

876
00:50:03,554 --> 00:50:06,682
那正是我说的
And that's what I said.

877
00:50:06,757 --> 00:50:09,282
但看看这个
But look at this.

878
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:13,797
这是什么？ 这是一块地
What is this? This is a piece of land.

879
00:50:13,864 --> 00:50:16,332
仔细听好我要告诉你的事
Listen to what I'm going to tell you now.

880
00:50:44,395 --> 00:50:46,488
发生什么事了？ 你在哪里工作？
 What happened? Where do you work?

881
00:50:46,564 --> 00:50:49,158
我就在这里上班
I work, yes. I work here.

882
00:50:49,233 --> 00:50:51,667
发生什么事了？ 盗窃
 What is it? What happened? Robbery.

883
00:50:58,075 --> 00:51:02,171
威林逊，他们抢走了合约没有？
Williamson. Williamson, did they get the contracts?

884
00:51:04,849 --> 00:51:07,249
快告诉我
All right, tell me. Now. Tell me.

885
00:51:07,318 --> 00:51:09,149
他们有没有偷走合约？ 对不起，先生
 They stole the contracts? Excuse me, sir.

886
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,619
他们有没有偷走我的合约？ 对不起，伙计
 Did they get my contract? Excuse me, fella.

887
00:51:10,688 --> 00:51:11,916
有没有？ 能先出去一下吗？
 Did they? Would you excuse us?

888
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:14,116
别惹我，伙计 我是在说你欠我的
Don't fuck with me, fella. I'm talking about a Cadillac car

889
00:51:14,191 --> 00:51:16,819
那辆卡迪拉克房车 他们没偷走你的合约
 that you owe me. They didn't get your contract.

890
00:51:16,894 --> 00:51:19,260
我离开前都放好了 他们没偷走我的合约？
 I filed it before I left. They didn't get my contracts?

891
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:21,264
他们偷走了 失陪

You know your business, I know mine. Your business is being an asshole.

Cop couldn't find his dick with two hands and a map.

I'm going home because nothing's accomplished here.

警察没权利对我那样说话 又不是我干的
Cop's got no right to talk to me that way. I did not rob the place.

1067
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:56,738
你听见我说什么了吗？ 听到了，他完成了那些生意

 Those fucking deadbeats. My ass. I told 'em... listen to this.

1076
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:22,933
我不想听你的破故事 去你的，戴夫
 I don't want to hear your war stories. Fuck you, Dave.

1077
01:00:23,006 --> 01:00:25,440
我说，“你要相信自己”
I said, "You have to believe in yourself."

1078
01:00:25,509 --> 01:00:27,909
给我单生意 我要出去谈生意
Give me a lead. I'm going out. I'm getting out.

1079
01:00:27,978 --> 01:00:32,813
去他妈的生意，我要回家 去他妈的，布鲁斯
 Fuck the leads. I'm going home. "Fuck me, Bruce.

1080
01:00:32,883 --> 01:00:34,441
你得相信自己 我们没有生意可谈
 You have to believe in yourself." We haven't got a lead.

1081
01:00:34,518 --> 01:00:36,986
为什么？ 都被偷走了
 Why not? They took 'em.

1082
01:00:37,054 --> 01:00:39,648
反正那些也都是垃圾生意
They're fucking garbage, any case. The whole goddamn...

1083
01:00:39,723 --> 01:00:43,056
看看周围的人，那人有这个有那个 我什么都没有
"You look around, you say, 'This one has so and so. I got nothing.

1084
01:00:43,126 --> 01:00:45,617
为什么我就没有机会呢？
But why? Why don't I get the opportunities?"'

1085
01:00:45,696 --> 01:00:48,290
他们偷了合约吗？ 你关心这个干吗？
 Did they steal the contracts? What the fuck do you care?

1086
01:00:48,365 --> 01:00:50,162
你这话什么意思？
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

1087
01:00:50,234 --> 01:00:52,259
你闭嘴好吗？ 我正在和他谈事情
Will you shut up? I'm telling him something.

1088
01:00:54,204 --> 01:00:55,865
有人要喝咖啡吗？
Could we get some coffee?

1089
01:00:55,939 --> 01:00:58,100
你没事吧？ 我很好
 How are you doing? Fine.

1090
01:00:58,987 --> 01:01:00,155
Uh huh.

1091
01:01:01,345 --> 01:01:03,245
有人出去就买些咖啡回来
Anybody's going out, I could use some coffee.

1092
01:01:05,616 --> 01:01:09,108
“你现在就有个好机会” 那是什么意思？
 "You do get the opportunity." Fuck is that supposed to mean?

1093
01:01:09,186 --> 01:01:11,484
你有机会的 你有机会，我也有机会
"You do get the opportunities. You get 'em as I get 'em,

1094
01:01:11,955 --> 01:01:14,287
人人都有机会的 我不在乎他们偷走了合约？
 as everybody gets 'em." I don't care they stole the contracts?

1095
01:01:14,358 --> 01:01:16,485
我在厨房内一边吃蛋糕一边说服他们
I got 'em in the kitchen, eating their crumb cake...

1096
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,790
你那话是什么意思？ 戴夫，我是说
 What does that mean? It means, Dave,

1097
01:01:18,862 --> 01:01:21,092
你一整个月都没完成一单生意
You haven't closed a good one in a month.

1098
01:01:21,164 --> 01:01:22,995
不关我的事，是你逼我说的
None of my business, you want to push me to answer you.

1099
01:01:23,066 --> 01:01:26,126
所以你根本没合约给人偷
So you haven't got a contract to get stolen and so forth.

1100
01:01:26,203 --> 01:01:29,036
你的性情真坏 都给我闭嘴！
You got a mean streak in you. Shut the fuck up!

1101
01:01:29,106 --> 01:01:32,303
理查德，你这个性情真坏 你在胡说些什么？
Ricky, you got a mean streak in you, and what are you babbling about?

1102
01:01:32,376 --> 01:01:34,241
你在谈论我的销售额吗？
You bring that shit up... on my volume?

1103
01:01:34,311 --> 01:01:37,474
如果现在是我在嘲笑你
If you were on a bad one and I brought it up to you, you'd harbor it.

1104
01:01:37,547 --> 01:01:40,015
你一定会一直怀恨在心
You'd harbor it a long while and you'd be right.

1105
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:42,449
是谁说“去他妈的机器”？ 去他妈的“机器”？
 Who said "Fuck 'The Machine"'? Fuck "The Machine"?

1106
01:01:42,519 --> 01:01:45,044
去他妈的“机器”？ 去他妈的“机器”！
Fuck "The Machine"? Fuck "The Machine"!

1107
01:01:45,122 --> 01:01:48,489
你是在给我上礼仪课吗？ 去你妈的
What is this, courtesy class? You're fucked, Rick.

1108
01:01:48,558 --> 01:01:51,322
你发疯了吗？ 你很红，所以你就以为
Are you fucking nuts? You're hot, so you think

1109
01:01:51,395 --> 01:01:52,987
你可以指手划脚了吗？ 等等，戴夫
 you're the ruler of this place. Wait a minute, Dave.

1110
01:01:53,063 --> 01:01:54,826
闭嘴！ 好吧…
 Shut up! Okay...

1111
01:01:54,898 --> 01:01:57,389
你想决定谁该干什么，对吗？
You want to decide who should be dealt with how, is that it?

1112
01:01:57,467 --> 01:02:00,368
今天我一走进办公室 就被那些笨蛋警察羞辱
I come into the office today, I get humiliated by some jag off cop.

1113
01:02:00,437 --> 01:02:02,337
我被指为 
I get accused of...

1114
01:02:02,406 --> 01:02:06,069
我被你侮辱就因为你的销售额最高？
I get shit thrown in my face because you're top name on the board?

1115
01:02:06,143 --> 01:02:09,010
我有侮辱你吗，戴夫？
Is that what I did, Dave... I humiliated you?

1116
01:02:09,079 --> 01:02:12,606
天啊，对不起 你高高在上
 Oh, my God, I'm sorry. Sitting on top of the world.

1117
01:02:12,683 --> 01:02:15,550
坐在世界的最顶端 一切都不再受到尊重
Sitting on top of the world... everything's fucking peach fuzz.

1118
01:02:15,619 --> 01:02:18,850
我没那么有空，花时间去侮辱
I don't get a moment to spare for some bust out humanitarian

1119
01:02:18,922 --> 01:02:20,719
那些没用的家伙！ 去你的！

1120
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:22,588
去你的，戴夫 你知道你很爱炫耀
Fuck you, Dave... you know you got a big mouth.

1121

做成一单生意 你的屁便在这里臭足一星期
You make a close, this whole place stinks with your farts for a week...

1122
01:02:25,962 --> 01:02:30,296
你赚到多少？ 你真伟大！
how much you just ingested. Oh, what a big man you are!

1123
01:02:30,367 --> 01:02:33,063
“我来教你该怎么嚼口香糖”
"Let me buy you a pack of gum... I'll show you how to chew it."

1124
01:02:33,136 --> 01:02:36,105
你的朋友成功了，你只会乱吠
Your pal closes, and all that comes out of your mouth is bile.

1125
01:02:36,173 --> 01:02:39,336
你真混！
How fucked up you are!

1126
01:02:39,409 --> 01:02:44,278
谁是我的好朋友，理查德？ 那你呢？
Who's my pal, Ricky? Hmm? And what are you?

1127
01:02:44,348 --> 01:02:47,681
你是什么，“主教大人”？
What are you, huh, Bishop Sheen?

1128
01:02:47,751 --> 01:02:49,844
你他妈的是什么，“滑头”？
What the fuck are you, "Mr. Slick"?

1129

还是“一个职员的好朋友”
What the fuck are you, "Friend to the working man"?

1130

Big deal! Fuck you!

1131

你就象只讨厌的苍蝇！
You got the memory of a fucking fly!

1132
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:04,566
我从没喜欢过你
I never liked you, anyway.

1133
01:03:04,634 --> 01:03:06,761
这算什么，你的道别演说？
What is this, your farewell speech?

1134
01:03:06,837 --> 01:03:09,237
我要回家去 你要离开我们？
 I'm going home. Your farewell to the troops?

1135

1138
01:03:21,418 --> 01:03:23,249
你说到哪里了？
You were saying?

1139
01:03:26,089 --> 01:03:27,920
继续说吧
Come on.

1140
01:03:27,991 --> 01:03:30,255
继续吧，你在厨房说服了他们
Come on... you got 'em in the kitchen,

1141

你穿着长袖衬衫
you're in your shirtsleeves,

1142
01:03:33,029 --> 01:03:35,327
你能闻到
you got the stats spread out,

1143
01:03:35,399 --> 01:03:38,664
一股银纸气味 继续说下去
you can smell it. Come on, snap out of it.

1144
01:03:38,735 --> 01:03:42,102
你在吃她的蛋糕 对，没错
 You're eating her crumb cake. Oh yeah, I'm eating her crumb cake.

1145
01:03:42,172 --> 01:03:45,300
味道如何？ 从商店里买来的
 How was it? From the store.

1146
01:03:45,375 --> 01:03:47,935
去她妈的 布鲁斯，哈瑞特…
 Fuck her. "Bruce, Harriett...

1147
01:03:48,011 --> 01:03:51,879
我们要承认我们看见了这机会
we have to admit to ourselves that we see that opportunity

1148
01:03:51,948 --> 01:03:55,384
要把握住它 就这样 我们就坐在那里
and take it... and that's it." Now, we just sit there.

1149
01:03:55,485 --> 01:03:57,282
我拿出笔 “永远做个成功者”
 I got my pen out. "Always Be Closing."

1150
01:03:57,354 --> 01:03:59,845
我正是不断这样说的
God, that's what I've been saying... the old ways.

1151
01:03:59,923 --> 01:04:03,450
给那混蛋洗脑，让他签了支票
Convert that motherfucker, sell him, make him sign the check.

1152
01:04:03,527 --> 01:04:05,392
他们买了很多政府债券
They got their money in government bonds...

1153
01:04:05,462 --> 01:04:09,057
我说，“去他妈的债券，全投进去”
I said, "Fuck it... let's go all the way, the whole route."

1154
01:04:09,132 --> 01:04:13,432
我划了八个单位，八万两千块 我对他们说
I take it and plat it out... eight units, 82 grand, and I say to them,

1155
01:04:13,503 --> 01:04:18,600
现在就是你们一直梦想的时刻了
"This is now. This is that thing that you have been dreaming of.

1156
01:04:18,675 --> 01:04:21,166
你会在火车上找到个行李箱
You are going to find the suitcase on the train.

1157
01:04:21,244 --> 01:04:24,475
里面装满了钞票
The man walks in the room, that bag is filled with money.

1158
01:04:24,548 --> 01:04:28,075
哈瑞特和布鲁丝 我不想愚弄你们
Harriett, this is it, and Bruce... I don't want to fuck around with you.

1159
01:04:28,151 --> 01:04:31,348
我不想四处招摇撞骗
No, I don't. I don't want to pussyfoot around.

1160
01:04:31,421 --> 01:04:34,652
你还要再考虑考虑？ 我也要考虑一下
You think you got to look back on this thing? I do, too.

1161
01:04:34,724 --> 01:04:38,160
我们大家都有好处
Now, I'm here to do good for you and me... the both of us.

1162
01:04:38,228 --> 01:04:41,527
先付点订金是什么意思？
What is the point of some interim position?

1163
01:04:41,598 --> 01:04:45,193
我只接受全额付款
The only arrangement I will accept is full investment.

1164
01:04:45,268 --> 01:04:48,328
我是认真的，八个单位一次付清
And I mean it, that's it... all eight units. Period."

1165
01:04:48,405 --> 01:04:50,999
我手上拿着笔，理查德 嘿
Now I got the pen in my hand, Rick... hey.

1166
01:04:51,074 --> 01:04:55,909
我拿着价值八万两千块的合约
I turned that contract around... that's eight units, 82 grand...

1167
01:04:55,979 --> 01:05:00,040
我说，“我要你签了它”
and I said, "I want you to sign."

1168
01:05:00,116 --> 01:05:03,142
我坐了五分钟
I sat there five minutes.

1169
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:08,624
跟着在厨房的钟旁做了二十分钟
Then I sat 22 minutes by that kitchen clock on the wall.

1170
01:05:08,692 --> 01:05:11,490
理查德 面无表情，一言不发
Ricky... not a word, not a motion.

1171
01:05:11,561 --> 01:05:14,223
我在想什么？ “我的手臂累了吗？”
And what am I thinking? "Is my arm getting tired?"

1172
01:05:14,297 --> 01:05:17,130
不是，我成功了 就象以前那样
No. I did it. Just like the old days,

1173
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,827
象我被教的那样
like I used to, like I was taught.

1174
01:05:18,902 --> 01:05:20,995
我成功了 象你教我的一样
 I did it. Like you taught me.

1175
01:05:21,071 --> 01:05:24,131
从没有人 若我成功了我很开心
Nobody ever... well, if I did, I'm glad.

1176
01:05:24,207 --> 01:05:26,266
我只是紧紧的盯着他们
No, what I did... I locked on 'em.

1177
01:05:26,343 --> 01:05:28,971
我紧紧的盯着他们，面无表情
I locked all on them... nothing on me... on them.

1178
01:05:29,045 --> 01:05:32,139
天啊，我拿定了主意
And, oh God, I am holding my last thought,

1179
01:05:32,215 --> 01:05:34,877
“现在是时候了”
"Now is the time."

1180
01:05:35,952 --> 01:05:39,547
他们签了合约，太棒了
They signed. It was great.

1181
01:05:39,623 --> 01:05:42,319
真他妈的太棒了
It was so fucking great.

1182
01:05:42,392 --> 01:05:46,294
他们一下子意志消沉下来
It was like they wilted all at once.

1183
01:05:46,363 --> 01:05:48,991
没有做手势，只是靠在一起
 Mmm. No gesture, nothing... just together.

1184
01:05:49,065 --> 01:05:54,162
他们俩异常的意志消沉
Honest to God, they both imperceptibly slumped.

1185
01:05:54,237 --> 01:05:57,866
然后他伸手拿笔签了和约
And then he reached and he took the pen and he signed,

1186
01:05:57,941 --> 01:06:00,068
然后递给她，她也签了名
passed it to her and she signed.

1187
01:06:00,143 --> 01:06:02,407
那场面太严肃了
It was solemn... fucking solemn.

1188
01:06:02,479 --> 01:06:07,473
我没迫他们，接着我点了点头 我说“哈瑞特，布鲁斯”
I let it sit, and then I nodded. I said, "Harriett, Bruce,"

1189
01:06:07,551 --> 01:06:09,985
我指向客厅餐具柜那里
then I pointed into the living room to the sideboard.

1190
01:06:10,053 --> 01:06:12,283
我不知道那里有餐具柜
I didn't know there was a sideboard in there.

1191
01:06:12,355 --> 01:06:14,346
他走过去，倒了杯酒给我们
He went over, he brought us back a drink...

1192
01:06:14,424 --> 01:06:17,916
用很细很精致的那种
little shot glasses with a pretty design in 'em.

1193
01:06:19,529 --> 01:06:23,158
我们默默的干杯
And we just toasted in silence.

1194
01:06:23,233 --> 01:06:26,691
做的好，沙利
Great sale, Shelly.

1195
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:28,795
太好了
Great.

1196
01:06:28,872 --> 01:06:31,807
他妈的！快给我新的生意！ 我要出门！
Fuck! Send me out! Give me leads!

1197
01:06:31,875 --> 01:06:32,899
威林逊，快派我出去！
 Williamson! Send me out! Whoa!

1198
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:35,601
生意马上就到 快给我
 The leads are coming. Get 'em to me.

1199
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:38,307
我一小时前和米奇还有默里谈过 他们正赶来这里
I talked to Mitch and Murray an hour ago. They're coming in.

1200
01:06:38,381 --> 01:06:41,009
他们对此有点不开心 有告诉他们我做成了生意吗？
 They're a bit upset over this. Did you tell 'em my sale?

1201
01:06:41,084 --> 01:06:43,484
我怎告诉他们你做成了生意？ 我连电话都没有 
How could I tell 'em your sale? I didn't have a tele...

1202
01:06:43,553 --> 01:06:45,885
他们来时我会告诉他们的
I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.

1203
01:06:45,956 --> 01:06:48,891
你完成了生意，你做的很好
We had a little... you closed the deal, you made a good sale. Fine.

1204
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:51,860
不止是笔好生意 我很忙
 Better than a good sale. I have a lot of things on my mind.

1205
01:06:51,928 --> 01:06:55,125
他们正赶来这里，而且很不开心 我正试着 
They're coming and they're very upset. I'm trying to make...

1206
01:06:55,198 --> 01:06:57,962
我只想你告诉他们 这是笔有纪念价值的好生意
All I'm telling you is, you can tell them it was a remarkably good sale.

1207
01:06:58,034 --> 01:07:00,764
唯一值得注意的 是你做成生意的对象
The only thing remarkable about it is who you made it to.

1208
01:07:00,837 --> 01:07:04,295
这话什么意思？ 如果交易成功那将是个奇迹
 What the fuck does that mean? If the sale sticks it'll be a miracle.

1209
01:07:04,374 --> 01:07:06,672
如果成功的话？ 为什么不会成功？
"If the sale sticks"? Why shouldn't the sale stick?

1210
01:07:06,743 --> 01:07:10,770
去你的！ 你不知道你该做什么
Oh, fuck you! You do not know your job.

1211
01:07:10,847 --> 01:07:12,678
你知道吗？ 要知人善用！
Do you know that? A man is his job!

1212
01:07:12,749 --> 01:07:15,741
你却自以为是 你听到我在说什么吗？
You are fucked at yours. You hear what I'm saying to you?

1213
01:07:15,819 --> 01:07:17,912
你那该死的销售榜 
Your "End of the Month" fucking boar...

1214
01:07:17,988 --> 01:07:19,785
你不懂如何管理这办公室
you do not know how to run this office.

1215
01:07:19,856 --> 01:07:22,256
你没有头脑，根本不是男人
You haven't got the sense. You haven't got the balls.

1216
01:07:22,325 --> 01:07:25,488
你有成功过吗？这衰人有吗？
Have you ever been on a sit? Has this cocksucker been on a sit?

1217
01:07:25,562 --> 01:07:28,292
你有做成过 如果我是你，我会冷静下来
 Did you ever sit... If I were you, I would calm down.

1218
01:07:28,365 --> 01:07:30,333
是吗？ 你想对我怎样，开除我？
Would you? What are you gonna do, fire me?

1219
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,300
哦，理查德
Oh, oh, Rick, ooh.

1220
01:07:32,369 --> 01:07:35,634
那不是没可能 真的吗？我一天赚了八万块
 It's not impossible. Really? On an $80,000 day?

1221
01:07:35,705 --> 01:07:38,173
甚至还没到下午呢 你今天做成这单生意了？
 It's not even noon yet. You closed 'em today?

1222
01:07:38,241 --> 01:07:40,903
我一早便起来找他们，做成了这单生意
I got up early this morning, tracked 'em down, and closed it.

1223
01:07:40,977 --> 01:07:44,276
我要告诉你一切都改变了
What I'm saying to you is that things change.

1224
01:07:44,347 --> 01:07:47,714
这正是你失败之处，你不能回头看
That's where you fuck up. You don't know. You can't look back.

1225
01:07:47,784 --> 01:07:51,845
你看不到谁在赶上来 或许是个新人？
You don't see who's coming. Maybe it's someone new, huh?

1226
01:07:51,921 --> 01:07:54,082
也许是其他人，但你不知道
Maybe it's someone else, but you don't know...

1227
01:07:54,157 --> 01:07:56,819
你不能回头看 因为你不知道自己的过去！
you can't look back, because you don't know your history!

1228
01:07:56,893 --> 01:07:59,259
我们在推销尼奥牧场的时候 谁是最棒的？
When we were on Rio Rancho, who was the top man, huh?

1229
01:07:59,329 --> 01:08:01,263
有两个月，或是三个月？
For what, two months, three months?

1230
01:08:01,331 --> 01:08:04,300
三年里有八个月我排第一！
How about eight months, for three years in a row!

1231
01:08:04,367 --> 01:08:08,133
你要说是我运气好，约翰？ 或是靠偷的生意？
Luck... was that it, John? Or purloined fucking leads?

1232
01:08:08,204 --> 01:08:10,035
是才能 是的
 It was talent! Yes.

1233
01:08:10,106 --> 01:08:13,633
上门挨家挨户推销 这叫“电话推销”，约翰
Door to door. It's called "cold calling," John.

1234
01:08:13,743 --> 01:08:17,110
我甚至不知道他们叫什么 他们不想买我有的东西
Shit, I don't even know their name. They don't want to buy what I've got.

1235
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:19,876
劝诱推销，没有这名称前 我们就已经在这样做了
Soft sell... we were doing it before we had a name for it.

1236
01:08:19,949 --> 01:08:21,814
我说的没错吧？ 对
 Am I right? You're right, you're right.

1237
01:08:21,885 --> 01:08:25,753
你不会知道的 他甚至连什么是性情也不知道
You wouldn't know, you cock... he doesn't even know what a streak is.

1238
01:08:25,822 --> 01:08:28,188
你究竟是谁？
What the hell are you?

1239
01:08:28,258 --> 01:08:30,988
你只是个该死的秘书 去你的！
You're a fucking secretary. Fuck you!

1240
01:08:31,061 --> 01:08:34,462
我正要这样说你 去你的，吻我屁股吧
That's my message to you... fuck you, and kiss my ass.

1241
01:08:34,531 --> 01:08:38,297
你不喜欢的话 我就去隔壁街找谢利格拉夫
If you don't like that, I go across the street and speak to Jerry Graff.

1242
01:08:38,368 --> 01:08:40,233
去你妈的
Period. Fuck you.

1243
01:08:40,303 --> 01:08:43,466
听我说 把我的名字写上销售榜
Listen to me... you put me on that fucking board,

1244
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:46,008
我今天要三单有希望的生意
and I want three promising leads for today,

1245
01:08:46,076 --> 01:08:49,102
我不要那些垃圾 最好是靠的比较近的生意
I don't want any bullshit, and I want 'em close together,

1246
01:08:49,179 --> 01:08:51,340
因为我要一次过完成它们
because I am going to close them all.

1247
01:08:51,414 --> 01:08:54,645
就这么多，我说完了
And that's all I have to say to you.

1248
01:08:55,985 --> 01:08:59,011
他说的对，威林逊
He's right, Williamson.

1249
01:09:01,624 --> 01:09:04,889
对不起，但这样做是错的 你知道是谁的错吗？
I'm sorry, but it's wrong, and you know whose fault it is?

1250
01:09:04,961 --> 01:09:06,553
米奇和默里
Mitch and Murray.

1251
01:09:09,099 --> 01:09:11,863
理查德，一起去吃午饭吧？
To hell with him. Let's get some lunch, huh, Rick?

1252
01:09:11,935 --> 01:09:14,096
反正要迟一点才有生意做
The leads won't be up here till later anyway.

1253
01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:17,537
你来扮客户 我刚卖了五个格兰加利农场给你
You're a client. I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.

1254
01:09:17,607 --> 01:09:20,405
看见我摸我的头发 就提示我“肯尼维斯”
I do this with my hair, throw me the cue "Kenilworth".

1255
01:09:20,477 --> 01:09:22,911
哪里？ 肯尼维斯
 Which is it? Kenilworth.

1256
01:09:22,979 --> 01:09:25,675
我在那里拥有物业，其实是我妈的
I own the property. My mother owns the property.

1257
01:09:25,749 --> 01:09:27,512
我说服了她
I put her into it.

1258
01:09:27,584 --> 01:09:30,781
回家后可以看看地图，你会发现
You look on the plats when you go home. You'll see...

1259
01:09:30,854 --> 01:09:33,584
A 3到10，26到30
A 3 through 10, 26 through 30.

1260
01:09:33,656 --> 01:09:37,387
你可再考虑一下，如果你 不用了，理查德
 Take your time. If you still feel... I won't need more time, Rick.

1261
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:39,553
我已经有很多物业了 我要和你谈谈
 I've bought a lot of property. I've got to talk to you.

1262
01:09:39,629 --> 01:09:42,063
吉姆，你来这里干什么？
Jim, what are you doing here?

1263
01:09:42,132 --> 01:09:45,363
吉姆林克 瑞莫顿
Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton.

1264
01:09:45,435 --> 01:09:48,495
很高兴认识你 我刚卖了黑溪的物业给他
 I'm glad to meet you. I put Jim into Black Creek.

1265
01:09:48,571 --> 01:09:51,472
你知道 黑溪？我不知道
 Are you acquainted with... Black Creek? No.

1266
01:09:51,541 --> 01:09:53,338
哦，是在佛罗里达！ 对
 Ooh, in Florida! Yes.

1267
01:09:53,409 --> 01:09:56,572
我喜欢谈这个 周末再谈吧
 I meant to speak to you about that. We'll do that this weekend.

1268
01:09:56,646 --> 01:09:58,375
我太太叫我留意那地方
My wife suggested I look into it.

1269
01:09:58,448 --> 01:10:01,212
那地方很漂亮 我有告诉吉姆和珍尼
Beautiful rolling land... I was telling Jim and Jinny.

1270
01:10:01,284 --> 01:10:04,685
瑞，我有事要告诉你 你去过很多餐厅品尝美味对吗？
Ray, I got to tell you something. You eat in a lot of restaurants?

1271
01:10:04,754 --> 01:10:07,621
我知道你有 瑞在美国运通银行工作
I know you do. Ray is with American Express.

1272
01:10:07,690 --> 01:10:09,555
我能告诉吉姆你的职业吗？ 当然可以
 Can I tell Jim what you do? Sure.

1273
01:10:09,626 --> 01:10:13,084
瑞主管所有的欧洲买卖和服务
Ray is the director of all European sales and services...

1274
01:10:13,163 --> 01:10:16,223
我要说的是，你没尝过美味 除非你吃过
what I'm saying is, you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...

1275
01:10:16,299 --> 01:10:18,096
我有一次在林克家里
I was at the Lingks'...

1276
01:10:18,168 --> 01:10:20,636
你说的那种特色服务叫什么？
what was that service feature you were talking about?

1277
01:10:20,703 --> 01:10:22,398
那个 “家常饭”
 Which... "Home cooking."

1278
01:10:22,472 --> 01:10:25,305
有个特别的叫法？ “烹调”
 You had a tag phrase you used? "Cooking"...

1279
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:27,002
“家庭烹调 ” 那个每月一次的访问
"Home cook..." the monthly interview.

1280
01:10:27,076 --> 01:10:29,237
那杂志！ 对！
 The magazine! Yes.

1281
01:10:29,312 --> 01:10:31,678
能谈谈吗？
Is that something I can talk about?

1282
01:10:31,748 --> 01:10:34,945
要到二月份的杂志才会登出来 不过没关系，你说吧
It won't be out until the February issue, but go ahead.

1283
01:10:35,018 --> 01:10:36,679
你确定吗？ 说吧
 Are you sure? Go ahead.

1284
01:10:36,753 --> 01:10:39,779
瑞在法国，去手下家里吃饭
Ray was eating at one of his company men's homes in France.

1285
01:10:39,856 --> 01:10:41,915
是个法国人？ 不是，他太太才是
 The man is French? No, but his wife is.

1286
01:10:41,991 --> 01:10:43,618
他太太
His wife.

1287
01:10:43,693 --> 01:10:46,287
瑞，现在几点了？
Ray, what time do you have?

1288
01:10:46,362 --> 01:10:49,160
12点15分 我得送你去机场了
 12:15. I got to get you on the plane.

1289
01:10:49,232 --> 01:10:51,029
我不是说两点吗？ 不，是一点
 Didn't I say the 2:00? No, the 1:00.

1290
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:54,035
所以要到肯尼维斯才能继续谈
Remember the 1:00... that's why we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.

1291
01:10:54,103 --> 01:10:56,230
你说的没错，一点钟 我们走吧
You're right, the 1:00... let's scoot.

1292
01:10:56,306 --> 01:10:58,433
很高兴认识你 我有话要跟你说
 A pleasure. I got to talk to you.

1293
01:10:58,508 --> 01:11:01,602
我要送瑞去机场 迟些再谈 约翰！
I got to run Ray to the airport. Let's hustle... John!

1294
01:11:01,678 --> 01:11:05,205
打电话去匹兹堡的美国运通
Get on the phone to Pittsburgh, American Express there, for Mr. Morton.

1295
01:11:05,281 --> 01:11:08,580
告诉他们瑞先生坐一点的飞机 再见
Tell them he's on the 1:00. I'll see you.

1296
01:11:08,651 --> 01:11:11,119
对不起要你白跑一趟
Christ, I'm sorry you came all the way in.

1297
01:11:11,187 --> 01:11:14,247
我要送瑞去机场 你可以在这里等
I'm running Ray to the airport. You wait here and...

1298
01:11:14,324 --> 01:11:16,918
不行，我要和那人一去走了
no, I can't. I'm meeting your man at the bank.

1299
01:11:16,993 --> 01:11:20,827
你该先打电话来的！ 你们今晚会在家吗？
I wish you'd have phoned! Are you and Jinny going to be home?

1300
01:11:20,897 --> 01:11:22,330
我不知道 理查德？
 I don't know. Rick?

1301
01:11:22,398 --> 01:11:23,922
什么事？ 肯尼维斯？
 What? Kenilworth?

1302
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,729
你说什么？ 肯尼维斯
 I'm sorry? Kenilworth.

1303
01:11:25,802 --> 01:11:28,703
对不起，瑞，等我一下
Oh, God. Excuse me, Ray... just a minute.

1304
01:11:28,771 --> 01:11:33,299
我告诉过你他是谁 美国运通银行的高级副总裁
Jim, I told you who he is... the senior vice president of American Express.

1305
01:11:33,376 --> 01:11:35,571
他的家族拥有32% 
His family owns 32 per...

1306
01:11:35,645 --> 01:11:39,547
过去几年，我卖给他很多土地 我说不出准确的数字
over the past years, I have sold him... I can't tell you the dollar amount...

1307
01:11:39,616 --> 01:11:42,278
很多块土地
but quite a lot of land.

1308
01:11:42,352 --> 01:11:45,810
我五星期前答应参加他太太今晚
I promised him five weeks ago that I would go to the wife's birthday party

1309
01:11:45,889 --> 01:11:48,414
在肯尼维斯的生日派对 我一定得去参加，明白吗？
in Kenilworth tonight. I have to go, you understand?

1310
01:11:48,491 --> 01:11:51,585
他们对我就象对自己家人那样
They treat me like a member of the family. I have to go.

1311
01:11:51,661 --> 01:11:55,859
真有趣 你知道他们那些家伙
It's funny... you get a picture of the corporation type company man,

1312
01:11:55,932 --> 01:11:58,400
只知道谈生意 这人，我以后再告诉你
all business... this guy, I'll tell you.

1313
01:11:58,468 --> 01:12:00,402
我们找个日子去他家
We'll go to his house someday.

1314
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:04,634
我看看 明天，我会在洛杉机？
Let me see. Tomorrow. I'm in L.A.?

1315
01:12:04,707 --> 01:12:07,039
啊，星期一
Ah, Monday.

1316
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:09,476
我会找你吃午饭 想去哪里吃？
I'll take you to lunch. Where would you like to eat?

1317
01:12:09,545 --> 01:12:10,978
我太太 理查德？
 My wife... Rick?

1318
01:12:11,047 --> 01:12:14,346
现在我没空，晚上打电话给你 我来了，瑞
I can't talk now, Jim... I'll call you tonight. Coming, Ray.

1319
01:12:14,417 --> 01:12:16,715
我太太说我必须取消那买卖
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.

1320
01:12:18,421 --> 01:12:20,981
这是正常的反应
That's a common reaction, Jim, and let me tell you what it is.

1321
01:12:21,057 --> 01:12:23,924
这正是你娶她的原因 她做事谨慎
That's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence.

1322
01:12:23,993 --> 01:12:26,757
这样大的投资是要谨慎的想清楚
No, it's a sizable investment. One thinks twice.

1323
01:12:26,829 --> 01:12:31,766
女人见到这样大的投资是会这样的
It's also something women have. Reaction to the size of the investment.

1324
01:12:32,302 --> 01:12:34,099
星期一你请我吃晚饭
Monday, you invite me to dinner again...

1325
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:36,070
他太太手艺很不错 我相信
 This woman can cook. I'm sure she can.

1326
01:12:36,139 --> 01:12:38,835
我们到时再谈 我要告诉你些事情
We are going to talk. I want to tell you something.

1327
01:12:38,908 --> 01:12:41,968
关于你那块地的面积的事 我想你该知道
Something about your acreage I want you to know.

1328
01:12:42,045 --> 01:12:45,811
现在我不能和你谈 我真的不该告诉你，从法律上说
I can't talk about it here, I really shouldn't, and by law...

1329
01:12:45,882 --> 01:12:50,216
排在你后面的那位
the man next to you... bought his lot at 42...

1330
01:12:50,286 --> 01:12:52,311
打电话来说他早就预定了
phoned to say he already had an offer.

1331
01:12:52,388 --> 01:12:54,049
理查德 我来了
 Rick. I'm coming.

1332
01:12:54,123 --> 01:12:56,614
瑞，真不巧 我晚上会打电话给你
Ray, what a day. I'll call you this evening.

1333
01:12:56,693 --> 01:12:59,992
很抱歉让你白跑一趟 星期一一起吃午饭
I'm sorry you had to come all the way in. Monday lunch.

1334
01:13:00,063 --> 01:13:01,758
我们得走了 星期一！
 We have to go. Monday!

1335
01:13:01,831 --> 01:13:05,528
她找过司法部长
She called the consumer... the attorney general?

1336
01:13:05,601 --> 01:13:08,001
他们说我们有三天时间 她找了谁？
 They said we have three days. Who'd she call?

1337
01:13:08,071 --> 01:13:11,165
司法部长 某个消费者办事处
The attorney ge... it was some consumer office.

1338
01:13:12,308 --> 01:13:14,640
她为什么这样做，吉姆？
Why'd she do that, Jim?

1339
01:13:14,711 --> 01:13:16,542
我不知道
I don't know.

1340
01:13:16,612 --> 01:13:18,443
但他们说我们只有三天时间
But they said we have three days.

1341
01:13:18,514 --> 01:13:21,608
有三天时间？
They said we got three days, yeah.

1342
01:13:21,684 --> 01:13:23,709
三天？
Three days?

1343
01:13:23,786 --> 01:13:27,847
你知道，去… 不，我不知道
 To... you know. No, I don't know.

1344
01:13:27,924 --> 01:13:31,451
告诉我 去改变主意，取消合约
 Tell me. To change our minds.

1345
01:13:31,527 --> 01:13:34,462
当然你们有三天时间
Of course you have... three days.

1346
01:13:34,530 --> 01:13:36,998
所以等不到星期一再谈
So we can't talk Monday.

1347
01:13:37,066 --> 01:13:39,694
星期一 你看到我的时间表了
Monday... you saw my book.

1348
01:13:39,769 --> 01:13:42,363
吉姆，我没时间
Jim, Jim... I can't.

1349
01:13:42,438 --> 01:13:44,303
你看到我的时间表了
You saw my book. I can't.

1350
01:13:44,374 --> 01:13:46,433
我们要在星期一前取回钱
We have to before Monday to get our money back.

1351
01:13:46,509 --> 01:13:48,534
他们说三个工作日
Three business days, they mean.

1352
01:13:48,611 --> 01:13:51,045
三个工作日 星期三，星期四，星期五
 Three business days. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

1353
01:13:51,114 --> 01:13:54,379
我不明白 三个工作日
 I don't understand. That's what they are, three business...

1354
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:56,543
若等到星期一那就来不及了
if we wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.

1355
01:13:56,619 --> 01:13:58,712
你没算上星期六 没有
 You don't count Saturday. I'm not.

1356
01:13:58,788 --> 01:14:01,450
我是说你没把星期六算在内
I'm saying you don't include Saturday in the three days.

1357
01:14:01,524 --> 01:14:04,891
那不是工作日 我没算在里面
 It's not a business day. I am not counting it.

1358
01:14:04,961 --> 01:14:09,625
星期三，星期四，星期五 然后就会过期了
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday... so it would have elapsed.

1359
01:14:09,699 --> 01:14:11,633
什么会过期？
What would have elapsed?

1360
01:14:11,701 --> 01:14:13,464
如果我们等到星期一就来不及了！
If we wait till Monday it would have elapsed!

1361
01:14:13,536 --> 01:14:15,800
你什么时候签的支票？ 昨天
 When did you write the check? Yesterday.

1362
01:14:15,872 --> 01:14:17,567
昨天星期几？星期二
 What was yesterday? Tuesday.

1363
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:20,734
支票什么时候兑现的？ 我不知道
 And when was that check cashed? I don't know.

1364
01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:23,176
最早可能是什么时候？
What was the earliest it could have been cashed?

1365
01:14:23,246 --> 01:14:26,613
我不知道 今天
 I don't know. Today.

1366
01:14:26,682 --> 01:14:29,879
今天，而且
Today. Which, in any case, it was not...

1367
01:14:29,952 --> 01:14:33,080
我还有些细节想和你谈谈
there was something on the agreement I wanted to go over with you.

1368
01:14:33,156 --> 01:14:35,147
还没有兑现吗？
It wasn't cashed?

1369
01:14:35,224 --> 01:14:37,419
我刚打电话去问，还在办公桌上
I just phoned downtown... it's on their desk.

1370
01:14:37,493 --> 01:14:39,654
理查德 再等我一会
 Rick. One moment.

1371
01:14:39,729 --> 01:14:42,527
我要对你说的是
One point, in fact, of which I spoke to you of which,

1372
01:14:42,598 --> 01:14:44,623
我现在不能和你谈
I can't talk to you about it here.

1373
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:46,998
赖芬！ 听我说
 Levene! Listen to me.

1374
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:51,029
法例保障你的利益，我没有意见
The statute is for your protection. I have no complaint with that.

1375
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:53,370
事实上，我也是 草拟那法案的成员之一
In fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it.

1376
01:14:53,443 --> 01:14:55,411
法例说
So quite the opposite. It says,

1377
01:14:55,478 --> 01:14:58,208
你可在买卖成交后
"You can change your mind three 'working days'

1378
01:14:58,281 --> 01:15:00,146
三个工作日内改变主意
from the time the deal was closed."

1379
01:15:00,216 --> 01:15:02,184
赖芬！ 等一下！
 Levene! Wait a second!

1380
01:15:02,251 --> 01:15:04,412
而不是支票兑现后！
Which is not until the check is cashed!

1381
01:15:04,487 --> 01:15:07,923
我受够这蠢货了 没人能那样跟我说话
I'm through with this "meshugaas". Nobody should talk to a man that way.

1382
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:10,288
你怎么能那样跟我说话？ 赖芬！
 How are you talking to me that way? Levene!

1383
01:15:10,359 --> 01:15:13,294
怎能那样跟我说话？ 我去叫的士
 How can you talk to me that way? I'm gonna flag a cab.

1384
01:15:13,362 --> 01:15:16,263
我没有打劫 沙利，进办公室来
 I didn't rob... Shelly, get in the office.

1385
01:15:16,332 --> 01:15:19,460
“你昨晚在哪里？” 有人在听我说吗？
"Where were you last?" Is anybody listening to me?

1386
01:15:19,535 --> 01:15:23,301
莫斯在哪里？ 这人是赖芬？
 Where's Moss? Is this Levene?

1387
01:15:23,372 --> 01:15:26,273
也许我可帮你应付他 失陪了
Perhaps I could assist you. Excuse us, will you?

1388
01:15:26,342 --> 01:15:29,834
我是来这里工作的！ 我不是来受虐待的！
I work here! I didn't come in here to be mistreated!

1389

Where does he get off talking that way to a working man?

1400
01:15:58,174 --> 01:16:02,270
“找律师” 这代表你被捕了
"Call an attorney"... that means you're under...

1401

我告诉你了 再告诉我一遍
 I told you. Tell me again.

1415

她想要回那笔钱
She wants her money back.

1418
01:17:06,709 --> 01:17:08,472
我们和她谈谈

No. No. This is something she said.

不需要觉得不忠
You needn't feel that you're being untrue

1485
01:20:39,789 --> 01:20:43,987
或是担心她知道后会遗弃你

这是你的生活

1522
01:22:54,223 --> 01:22:56,851
你害我损失了六千块
You just cost me $6,000.

1523
01:22:56,926 --> 01:23:03,490
六千块和一辆卡迪拉克
$6,000, and one Cadillac. That's right.

1524
01:23:03,566 --> 01:23:05,932
你打算怎么办？
What are you gonna do about it?

1525
01:23:06,001 --> 01:23:10,529
你打算怎么补偿我，王八蛋？
What are you gonna do about it, asshole?

1526
01:23:10,606 --> 01:23:12,540
他这他妈的没用的东西
You're fucking shit.

1527
01:23:12,608 --> 01:23:15,008
你在哪里学做生意的
Where did you learn your trade,

1528
01:23:15,077 --> 01:23:17,910
你这个傻瓜，蠢货！
you stupid fucking cunt, you idiot?

1529
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:20,414
谁告诉你可以和人一起工作？
Who ever told you that you could work with men?

1530
01:23:20,482 --> 01:23:21,881
我能…？
Could I...?

1531
01:23:21,951 --> 01:23:24,419
我会代替你的位置，笨蛋
Oh, I'm gonna have your job, shithead.

1532
01:23:24,486 --> 01:23:27,216
我去商业区找米奇和默里谈谈
I'm going downtown. I'm gonna talk to Mitch and Murray.

1533
01:23:27,289 --> 01:23:31,316
我要去林佩肯！ 我才不管你是谁的侄子
I'm going to Lemkin! I don't care whose nephew you are,

1534
01:23:31,393 --> 01:23:34,419
不管你认识谁，是谁的亲戚
who you know, whose dick you're sucking on,

1535
01:23:34,496 --> 01:23:36,828
我发誓，你要 
you're going out. I swear to you...

1536
01:23:36,899 --> 01:23:39,527
嘿，伙计，别再说了
Hey, fella, let's get this done.

1537
01:23:41,537 --> 01:23:45,029
这办公室里的人都靠自己的才智谋生
Anyone in this office lives on his wits...

1538
01:23:45,107 --> 01:23:47,837
再给我一小会儿
I'm gonna be with you in a second.

1539
01:23:50,546 --> 01:23:54,209
公司请你来是帮我们
What you're hired for is to help us.

1540
01:23:54,283 --> 01:23:57,081
你清楚吗？
Does that seem clear to you?

1541
01:23:57,152 --> 01:24:02,021
来帮我们！ 不是来破坏我们的买卖！
To help us! Not to fuck us up!

1542
01:24:02,091 --> 01:24:05,254
来帮那些出去谈生意的人
To help men who are going out there

1543
01:24:05,327 --> 01:24:08,819
维持生计，你这小仙女
to try to earn a living, you fairy.

1544
01:24:08,897 --> 01:24:10,626
你这公司的忠实奴才
You company man.

1545
01:24:10,699 --> 01:24:13,691
我还要告诉你 我真希望是你把这里弄的一团糟
I'll tell you something else, I hope you ripped the joint off.

1546
01:24:13,769 --> 01:24:17,296
我可以告诉他 帮他抓你起来
I can tell our friend here something, might help him to catch you.

1547
01:24:22,277 --> 01:24:24,643
如果你真正的活过一日
You wanna learn the first rule

1548
01:24:24,713 --> 01:24:27,705
你就会学到第一条规则
you'd know if you ever spent a day in your life?

1549
01:24:27,783 --> 01:24:33,153
没搞清楚事情就别开口说话
You never open your mouth till you know what the shot is.

1550
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:37,720
你个弱智儿童
You fucking child.

1551
01:24:49,972 --> 01:24:53,066
你真是个笨蛋，威林逊
You are a shithead, Williamson.

1552
01:24:54,943 --> 01:24:58,071
不知道那么多就不要出声
Can't think on your feet, you ought to keep your mouth closed.

1553
01:24:58,147 --> 01:25:01,310
听到我说的话吗？ 我在和你说话
Can you hear me? I'm talking to you.

1554
01:25:01,383 --> 01:25:03,214
我听到了
Yes, I hear you.

1555
01:25:03,285 --> 01:25:06,413
理查德说的没错，有些事 在办公室是学不到的，得上街去学
Ricky's right. Can't learn in an office, gotta learn it in the street.

1556
01:25:06,488 --> 01:25:08,683
有些东西你没法买到，只能自己去体会
And you sure can't buy it, you gotta live it.

1557
01:25:10,826 --> 01:25:14,091
完全正确 因为你的拍档需要 
Precisely. Because your partner depends...

1558
01:25:14,163 --> 01:25:16,097
我在试着告诉你一些道理！
I'm talking to you, trying to tell you something!

1559
01:25:16,165 --> 01:25:17,257
是吗？ 是的
 You are? Yeah, I am.

1560
01:25:17,332 --> 01:25:19,766
你想告诉我什么？ 诺马想告诉你的事情
 What are you trying to tell me? What Roma was trying to tell you.

1561
01:25:19,835 --> 01:25:23,168
我很早以前就和你说过 你不适合干这行
What I told you a long time ago. You don't belong in this business.

1562
01:25:23,238 --> 01:25:25,502
你听我说 有一天你也许会说
You might listen to me. One day you could say,

1563
01:25:25,574 --> 01:25:27,269
“嘿，也许那人 ” 去他妈的
"Hey, maybe the guy..." oh, fuck it.

1564
01:25:27,342 --> 01:25:30,334
现在听好了 你的拍档需要你的帮助
Listen to me now. Your partner depends on you.

1565
01:25:30,412 --> 01:25:32,972
你的合伙人依靠着你
The man who is your partner, depends on you.

1566
01:25:33,048 --> 01:25:36,017
你要帮他们否则你什么都不是！
You go with him and for him or you're shit!

1567
01:25:36,085 --> 01:25:38,315
你是堆狗屎 你不能独自一人生存
You are shit... you can't exist alone.

1568
01:25:38,387 --> 01:25:40,218
失陪 失陪你个头！
 Excuse me. "Excuse you," nothing!

1569
01:25:40,289 --> 01:25:43,417
你可真冷酷无情 你刚破坏了一个好人的好事
You be as cold as you want. You just fucked a good man

1570
01:25:43,492 --> 01:25:45,551
害他不见了六千块还有奖金
out of $6,000 and his goddamned bonus

1571
01:25:45,627 --> 01:25:47,686
就因为你不清楚状况
because you didn't know the shot.

1572
01:25:47,763 --> 01:25:50,061
你做的出却没勇气去面对？
You can do that and you're not man enough to say it gets you?

1573
01:25:50,132 --> 01:25:53,101
我不知道 如果你这样也学不懂的话
I don't know what... if you can't take something from that,

1574
01:25:53,168 --> 01:25:56,001
那你就是人渣！ 你他妈的是白痴！
then you're... scum! You're fucking white bread.

1575
01:25:56,071 --> 01:25:59,097
连小孩都知道 他说的对
A child would know it, he's right.

1576
01:25:59,174 --> 01:26:02,371
如果你想帮手，先要肯定是有帮助的
If you're gonna make something up, be sure that it helps.

1577
01:26:02,444 --> 01:26:05,413
不然就闭上你的臭嘴
Hmm? Or keep your mouth shut.

1578
01:26:05,481 --> 01:26:08,245
我说完了
I'm done with you.

1579
01:26:20,829 --> 01:26:22,421
你怎么知道我在撒谎？
How do you know I made it up?

1580
01:26:22,498 --> 01:26:24,830
什么？
What?

1581
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:27,835
你怎知道我撒谎？
How do you know I made it up?

1582
01:26:27,903 --> 01:26:30,394
你在说什么？
What are you talking about, huh?

1583
01:26:33,075 --> 01:26:36,135
你说“要先肯定有帮助才去做”
You said, "Don't make something up unless it's sure to help."

1584
01:26:38,180 --> 01:26:42,810
你怎知我在撒谎？ 你在说什么？
 How did you know I made it up? What are you talking about?

1585
01:26:50,092 --> 01:26:52,856
我告诉客户合约已送去银行
I told the customer his contract had gone to the bank.

1586
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:55,123
对，不是送去了吗？
Yeah. Well, hadn't it?

1587
01:26:58,867 --> 01:27:00,801
不，没有送去
No, it hadn't.

1588
01:27:03,405 --> 01:27:05,066
别愚弄我
Don't fuck with me.

1589
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:07,574
别愚弄我！ 你想说什么？
Don't fuck with me! What are you getting at?

1590
01:27:07,643 --> 01:27:10,407
我是在说，沙利…
I'm saying this, Shelly...

1591
01:27:12,915 --> 01:27:15,577
通常我会拿合约去银行
usually I take the contracts to the bank,

1592
01:27:15,651 --> 01:27:17,915
昨晚上则没有
last night I didn't.

1593
01:27:19,321 --> 01:27:22,449
我昨晚待在家里和孩子们一起
Last night I stayed home with my kids.

1594
01:27:24,459 --> 01:27:26,859
你怎么知道的？
How did you know that?

1595
01:27:28,831 --> 01:27:33,700
一年中只有昨晚上 我把合约留在桌上
One night in a year, I left a contract on my desk.

1596
01:27:33,769 --> 01:27:36,203
除了你之外，没有人知道
No one knew that but you.

1597
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:39,235
你怎么知道的？
Now, how did you know that?

1598
01:27:39,308 --> 01:27:42,903
你是要和我说还是想和警察谈谈？
You want to talk to me or you want to talk to someone else?

1599
01:27:42,978 --> 01:27:44,445
这是我的工作！
Because this is my job!

1600
01:27:44,513 --> 01:27:48,381
这是我的工作，你得告诉我！
This is my job on the line and you are gonna talk to me!

1601
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:51,442
你怎么知道合约在我桌上？
Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?

1602
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:54,080
你真的满口废话！
You are so full of shit!

1603
01:27:54,156 --> 01:27:56,488
是你打劫了办公室 没错，是我干的
 You robbed the office. Oh, sure, I robbed the office.

1604
01:27:56,558 --> 01:27:58,685
当然！你个王八蛋
Oh sure! You asshole.

1605
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:00,591
那些合约单子在哪里？
What did you do with the leads?

1606
01:28:00,662 --> 01:28:03,358
你想进去谈？ 我告诉他我知道的
You wanna go in there? I tell him what I know,

1607
01:28:03,432 --> 01:28:06,094
他会查出来的 你昨晚有不在场证据吗？
he's gonna dig up something. You got an alibi last night?

1608
01:28:06,168 --> 01:28:09,569
你最好有！ 你把那些合约怎么了？
You better have one! What did you do with the leads?

1609
01:28:09,638 --> 01:28:12,801
如果你告诉我，我们可以慢慢谈
If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.

1610
01:28:12,875 --> 01:28:15,207
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

1611
01:28:15,277 --> 01:28:17,643
如果你告诉我合约在哪里 我不会告发你的
If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.

1612
01:28:17,713 --> 01:28:20,113
否则我告诉警察是你偷的
If you don't, I'm gonna tell the cop you stole them.

1613
01:28:20,182 --> 01:28:23,310
米奇和默里会看见你被关进监狱的！
Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail, believe me, they will!

1614
01:28:23,385 --> 01:28:24,818
告诉我合约在哪里？
Now, where are the leads?

1615
01:28:24,887 --> 01:28:26,946
我要进去告诉警察了 你只有五秒钟时间
I'm walking in that door. You got five seconds

1616
01:28:27,022 --> 01:28:28,649
否则就要坐牢了！ 你去吧
 or you are going to jail! Go ahead.

1617
01:28:28,724 --> 01:28:31,192
我才不在乎，你明白吗？
I don't care, you understand?

1618
01:28:32,427 --> 01:28:34,952
合约在哪里？
Where are the leads?

1619
01:28:36,365 --> 01:28:38,458
好吧
All right.

1620
01:28:40,402 --> 01:28:42,370
我把它们卖了
I sold them.

1621
01:28:51,346 --> 01:28:53,837
卖给了谢利格拉夫
To Jerry Graff.

1622
01:28:53,916 --> 01:28:56,214
你得到多少钱？
How much did you get for them?

1623
01:28:56,285 --> 01:28:58,150
你拿到多少钱？
How much did you get for them?

1624
01:28:58,220 --> 01:29:00,552
五千块
Five. Five grand.

1625
01:29:00,622 --> 01:29:03,489
我拿到一半 那另外一半呢？
 I got half. Who got the other half?

1626
01:29:03,558 --> 01:29:05,549
我要告诉你吗？
Do I have to tell you?

1627
01:29:05,627 --> 01:29:08,152
莫斯
Moss.

1628
01:29:11,767 --> 01:29:13,826
钱来的真容易，对吗？
Well, that was easy, wasn't it?

1629
01:29:13,902 --> 01:29:16,427
是他的主意 是吗？
 His idea. Was it?

1630
01:29:16,505 --> 01:29:18,735
我想实际上他拿到不止五千
I think he got more than five, actually.

1631
01:29:18,807 --> 01:29:22,106
他告诉我能分到两千五百块
 Uh huh. He told me my cut was 2500.

1632
01:29:25,981 --> 01:29:27,608
等等 嘿，嘿，约翰！
Wait a minute. Okay... hey, hey, John!

1633
01:29:27,683 --> 01:29:30,880
等等，约翰！ 嘿，约翰
Wait... okay, John! Hey, Johnny.

1634
01:29:30,953 --> 01:29:34,480
过来
Listen. Come here, come here.

1635
01:29:36,658 --> 01:29:38,387
约翰？
Eh, John?

1636
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:40,724
昨晚…
Last night...

1637
01:29:40,796 --> 01:29:43,458
我得告诉你，我都准备自杀了
I gotta tell you, I'm ready to "do the Dutch".

1638
01:29:43,532 --> 01:29:46,467
莫斯救了我 “做了这事大家都有好处”
I'm done. Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well."

1639
01:29:46,535 --> 01:29:49,834
为什么不做呢？一笔大买卖 我希望我被抓住
Why not? Big fucking deal. I'm halfway hoping to get caught.

1640
01:29:49,905 --> 01:29:54,035
解决我的痛苦吧 我学到了很多东西，约翰
Hey... put me out of my misery. It taught me something, John.

1641
01:29:54,109 --> 01:29:56,577
这教晓了我，要那样做才行！
What it taught me... you gotta get out there!

1642
01:29:56,645 --> 01:29:59,978
我该是做经纪，而不是小偷！
I'm not cut out to be a thief, I'm cut out to be a salesman.

1643
01:30:00,182 --> 01:30:02,878
现在我重新找回了自信
And I am back. I got my balls back.

1644
01:30:02,951 --> 01:30:06,910
现在，你抓住我的弱点了
Now... you got a slight advantage on me.

1645
01:30:06,989 --> 01:30:09,583
但无论要什么代价，约翰
But whatever it takes, John,

1646
01:30:09,658 --> 01:30:12,183
我都要弄妥这事情
to make things right, we're gonna make it right.

1647
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:14,854
我们会弄妥这事情的
We are going to make it right.

1648
01:30:18,266 --> 01:30:20,063
我要告诉你件事，沙利
I want to tell you something, Shelly.

1649
01:30:20,135 --> 01:30:23,798
什么？ 你的嘴巴不牢靠
 Eh? You have a big mouth.

1650
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:26,397
什么？
What?

1651
01:30:26,475 --> 01:30:28,170
你的嘴巴不牢靠！
You've got a big mouth!

1652
01:30:28,243 --> 01:30:30,973
现在我让你看看更大的嘴巴
And now I'm gonna show you an even bigger one.

1653
01:30:31,046 --> 01:30:32,911
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

1654
01:30:32,981 --> 01:30:35,711
你不能那么做！ 你不想那么做的
You can't do that! You don't want to do that.

1655
01:30:35,784 --> 01:30:38,048
等等
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1656
01:30:39,788 --> 01:30:43,280
这里是两千五百块 全都拿去吧
It's $2,500. Go ahead and take it, take it all.

1657
01:30:43,358 --> 01:30:45,724
我不想要你的臭钱
No, I don't think so. I don't think I want your money.

1658
01:30:45,794 --> 01:30:48,695
你在我的地盘生事 你得离开这里！
I think you fucked up my office, and I think you're going away.

1659
01:30:48,764 --> 01:30:52,700
你疯了吗？ 我会替你赚钱！
Are you nuts? I'm gonna close for you! Take...

1660
01:30:52,768 --> 01:30:56,204
我会重新爬到销售榜首的
I'm gonna make this office and be number one on that board again.

1661
01:30:56,271 --> 01:30:58,569
等等，约翰
Wait, John.

1662
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:02,132
约翰 好吧
John... okay.

1663
01:31:04,946 --> 01:31:09,349
我给你我销售额的20%
This is what we're gonna do... 20%.

1664
01:31:09,418 --> 01:31:12,615
我做的每单生意都给你20%
I'm gonna give you 20% of all my sales.

1665
01:31:12,687 --> 01:31:15,622
只要我在这里干下去
20%, as long as I'm with this firm.

1666
01:31:15,690 --> 01:31:17,715
50%
50.

1667
01:31:17,793 --> 01:31:22,230
我销售额的一半 什么生意？
 50%of all my sales. What sales?

1668
01:31:22,297 --> 01:31:24,458
我刚做了八万两千块的生意
What sales? My God, I just closed 82 grand.

1669
01:31:24,533 --> 01:31:27,661
你疯了吗？ 我又重振雄风了！这只是开始！
Are you out of your fucking mind? I'm back! This is just the beginning!

1670
01:31:27,736 --> 01:31:30,204
只是刚开始？ 你去过哪里，沙利？
Just the beginning? Where have you been, Shelly?

1671
01:31:30,272 --> 01:31:33,241
布鲁斯和哈瑞特那里 你要看备忘录吗？
Bruce and Harriett Nyborg... do you want to see the memos?

1672
01:31:33,308 --> 01:31:36,903
他们是疯子 他们曾每星期都打电话来
They're nuts. They used to call in every week...

1673
01:31:36,978 --> 01:31:39,503
那时我还和韦伯在一起 我们在卖亚里桑那的地产
when I was with Webb... we were selling Arizona.

1674
01:31:39,581 --> 01:31:41,640
他们是疯子
They're nuts.

1675
01:31:41,716 --> 01:31:47,086
你有看到他们是怎么生活的？ 你怎能自欺欺人？
Did you see how they were living? How can you delude yourself?

1676
01:31:47,155 --> 01:31:49,123
我拿到了他们的支票 算了吧
 I've got their check. Forget it. Frame it.

1677
01:31:49,191 --> 01:31:51,386
一文不值的 支票是无效的？
 It's worthless. The check is no good?

1678
01:31:51,460 --> 01:31:53,826
你要看备忘录吗，上面写的很清楚 我很忙
You want to stick around? I'll pull the memo. I'm busy.

1679
01:31:53,895 --> 01:31:55,795
支票是无效的？ 他们是疯子？
The check is no good? They're nuts?

1680
01:31:55,864 --> 01:31:57,695
你要去问银行吗？我找过了
You want to call the bank? I called them.

1681
01:31:57,766 --> 01:32:01,429
四个月前完成第一笔生意时 我就找过银行了
I called them four months ago when we first got the lead.

1682
01:32:01,503 --> 01:32:04,267
他们有神经病
The people are insane.

1683
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:09,176
他们只是喜欢和经纪聊天
They just like talking to salesmen.

1684
01:32:14,182 --> 01:32:18,414
别那样！ 我很抱歉
 Don't! I'm sorry.

1685
01:32:21,022 --> 01:32:24,958
为什么？ 因为我不喜欢你
 Why? Because I don't like you.

1686
01:32:31,733 --> 01:32:33,724
我女儿
My daughter.

1687
01:32:33,802 --> 01:32:35,997
去你的
Fuck you.

1688
01:32:51,153 --> 01:32:53,553
混蛋
Asshole.

1689
01:32:53,622 --> 01:32:56,785
有人在客厅里找不到躺椅
Guy couldn't find his fucking couch in the living room.

1690
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,360
今天真好
What a day.

1691
01:33:03,498 --> 01:33:05,966
我连咖啡也没喝过
I haven't even had a cup of coffee.

1692
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:13,167
约翰乱说话害我不见了卡迪拉克
Jag off John opens his mouth, blows my Cadillac.

1693
01:33:15,677 --> 01:33:19,272
我敢发誓这不是人类世界
I swear, it's not a world of men.

1694
01:33:21,783 --> 01:33:24,479
不是人类的世界，“机器”
It is not a world of men, "Machine".

1695
01:33:24,553 --> 01:33:27,351
这世界到处都是混时间的人
 Huh? It's a world of clock watchers...

1696
01:33:27,422 --> 01:33:30,050
官僚主义者
bureaucrats...

1697
01:33:30,125 --> 01:33:32,855
官员，这些是什么
officeholders, what it is.

1698
01:33:33,929 --> 01:33:36,227
这是个他妈的世界
It's a fucked up world.

1699
01:33:38,567 --> 01:33:40,535
毫无新意
No adventure to it.

1700
01:33:40,602 --> 01:33:44,868
死气沉沉 对
Dying breed. Yes, it is.

1701
01:33:46,575 --> 01:33:50,306
我们是垂死的生物 所以
We're the members of a dying breed. That's... that's...

1702
01:33:50,378 --> 01:33:54,144
所以我们才会聚在一起，沙利？
that's why we got to stick together. Shel?

1703
01:33:54,216 --> 01:33:56,582
我想和你谈谈
 Huh? I want to talk to you.

1704
01:33:56,651 --> 01:33:58,949
我早就想和你谈谈了
I've wanted to talk to you for some time...

1705
01:33:59,020 --> 01:34:02,922
一早就想和你谈了 我说，“机器” 
for a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine"...

1706
01:34:02,991 --> 01:34:06,392
这才是我会和他合作的人
there's a man I would work with.

1707
01:34:06,461 --> 01:34:10,192
你知道，我从不称赞别人
There's... you know, I never said a word.

1708
01:34:10,265 --> 01:34:13,200
我不知道为什么
I don't know why I didn't. I should've, I don't know why.

1709
01:34:13,268 --> 01:34:17,102
你刚才教训他的那些话
And that shit you were slinging on my guy today...

1710
01:34:17,172 --> 01:34:21,336
真是说的太好了
that was so good. That... it...

1711
01:34:21,409 --> 01:34:24,207
对不起，我根本没权那样说
excuse me for saying this, it's not even my place to say it.

1712
01:34:24,279 --> 01:34:26,839
令人敬佩
That was admirable.

1713
01:34:26,915 --> 01:34:29,577
是古老的那套
It was the old stuff.

1714
01:34:29,651 --> 01:34:33,212
我性情急燥
Hey, I've been on a hot streak.

1715
01:34:33,288 --> 01:34:37,019
我能向你学些东西
So what? Things I can learn from you.

1716
01:34:39,094 --> 01:34:41,289
你吃了饭没有？ 我？
 You eat today? Me?

1717
01:34:41,363 --> 01:34:42,853
对
Yeah.

1718
01:34:42,931 --> 01:34:46,298
一起去查克斯，边吃边谈好吗？
Want to swing around the Chinks'... watch me eat, we'll talk?

1719
01:34:46,368 --> 01:34:48,700
我想我得多留一会儿
I think I'll stay around awhile.

1720
01:34:48,770 --> 01:34:50,738
史太太吗？
Hello, Mrs. Schwartz?

1721
01:34:50,805 --> 01:34:52,898
我是第一地产的理查德诺马
This is Richard Roma with Premiere Properties.

1722
01:34:52,974 --> 01:34:55,909
你的你的会计询问过
You or your accountant requested information on a land investment

1723
01:34:55,977 --> 01:34:58,571
有关小本大利的地产投资
which would offer you depreciation and the chance

1724
01:34:58,647 --> 01:35:00,877
这件事有眉目了
of a substantial return on a small investment.

1725
01:35:00,949 --> 01:35:03,383
我刚从佛罗里达过来 只能待一天
I'm in from Florida just for one day...

1726
01:35:03,451 --> 01:35:07,285
赖芬先生？ 我只剩下一个单位了
 Mr. Levene? ...so I only have that one lot left.

1727
01:35:07,355 --> 01:35:09,186
请你进来一下好吗？
Would you come in here, please?

1728
01:35:09,257 --> 01:35:11,623
我时间不多要乘夜机回去
I don't have too much time and I'm on the midnight plane back,

1729
01:35:11,693 --> 01:35:14,127
如果你或你丈夫真的感兴趣的话
so if you or your husband are truly interested...

1730
01:35:14,195 --> 01:35:16,663
因为我不能一直留起它
because I can't hold this parcel past...

1731
01:35:16,731 --> 01:35:19,222
是
Yes?

1732
01:35:19,301 --> 01:35:22,270
那你几点比较方便？ 六点还是八点？
Well, what would be better for you... say, 6:00 or 8:00?

1733
01:35:23,672 --> 01:35:27,802
去问他沙利 我们找时间谈谈？ 我会去查克斯
Go ask him. Shel... we're gonna talk? I'm going to the Chinks'.

1734
01:35:27,876 --> 01:35:29,810
你和他谈完了就来找我 我们一起抽烟
When you're done, come down. We're gonna smoke a cigarette.

1735
01:35:29,878 --> 01:35:32,005
我… 快进去
 I... Get in the room.

1736
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:35,982
嘿，放松点，朋友 他是“机器”
Hey. Hey, easy, pal. That's "The Machine".

1737
01:35:36,051 --> 01:35:39,077
这是沙利赖芬，“机器”
This is Shelly "The Machine" Levene.

1738
01:35:39,154 --> 01:35:41,520
快进去 理查德，我 
 Get in the goddamn room. Rick, I...

1739
01:35:41,589 --> 01:35:43,750
餐厅见 理查德 
 I'll meet you at the restaurant. Ricky...

1740
01:35:43,825 --> 01:35:45,690
理查德帮不了你 我只是想 
 Ricky can't help you. All I want is...

1741
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,819
你想怎样？
What do you want? You want to what?

1742
01:35:47,896 --> 01:35:51,798
理查德？ 喂？好极了
 Rick? Rick? Hello? Excellent.

1743
01:35:53,234 --> 01:35:58,069
晚上八点，6947，欧几里得
8:00 p.m. 6947 Euclid.

1744
01:35:58,139 --> 01:36:00,869
别客气，谢谢你
Not at all... thank you very much.

1745
01:36:11,553 --> 01:36:14,784
他们找到了那窃贼？
They find the guy that broke in the office?

1746
01:36:14,856 --> 01:36:18,019
不，我不知道
No. I don't know.

1747
01:36:22,864 --> 01:36:24,957
生意来了没有？
Did the leads come in yet?

1748
01:36:25,033 --> 01:36:27,501
还没有
No.

1749
01:36:35,377 --> 01:36:37,675
天啊，我讨厌这份工作
Oh God, I hate this job.

1750
01:36:37,746 --> 01:36:39,839
有人找我的话就说我在餐厅
Anybody wants me, I'm at the restaurant.

1751
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:48,218
喂？杜佳太太？
Hello, Mrs. Delgari?

1752
01:36:48,289 --> 01:36:51,120
你询问过有关尼奥牧场的地产？
Yes... you requested some information about Rio Rancho Properties?

1753
01:36:51,139 --> 01:36:55,852
Blue skies smiling at me

1754
01:36:55,936 --> 01:37:01,232
Nothing but blue skies do I see

1755
01:37:01,316 --> 01:37:04,319
In the morning there's bluebirds

1756
01:37:04,402 --> 01:37:07,364
Singing a song

1757
01:37:07,405 --> 01:37:10,367
Nothing but bluebirds

1758
01:37:10,408 --> 01:37:13,370
From now on

1759
01:37:13,453 --> 01:37:16,581
I never saw the sun shining so bright

1760
01:37:16,665 --> 01:37:19,417
Never saw things going so right

1761
01:37:19,501 --> 01:37:22,420
Noticing the days hurrying by

1762
01:37:22,462 --> 01:37:25,966
When you're in love, my, how they fly

1763
01:37:26,049 --> 01:37:30,387
Blue days, all of them gone

1764
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:35,517
Nothing but blue skies from now on...

1765
01:38:21,021 --> 01:38:25,650
Blue skies smiling at me

1766
01:38:25,734 --> 01:38:31,448
Nothing but blue skies do I see

1767
01:38:31,489 --> 01:38:33,867
In the morning there's bluebirds

1768
01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:36,995
Singing a song

1769
01:38:37,078 --> 01:38:41,958
Nothing but, nothing but bluebirds from now on

1770
01:38:42,042 --> 01:38:44,419
Let me tell you I never saw the sun

1771
01:38:44,502 --> 01:38:46,046
Shining so bright

1772
01:38:46,129 --> 01:38:48,965
Never saw things going so right

1773
01:38:49,049 --> 01:38:51,801
Noticing the days hurrying by

1774
01:38:51,885 --> 01:38:54,846
When you're in love, my, how they fly

1775
01:38:54,930 --> 01:38:59,559
Blue skies smiling at me

1776
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:04,898
Nothing but blue skies do I see

1777
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:07,150
In the morning there's bluebirds

1778
01:39:07,233 --> 01:39:10,654
Singing a song

1779
01:39:10,737 --> 01:39:15,492
Nothing but, nothing but bluebirds from now on

1780
01:39:15,575 --> 01:39:17,953
Let me tell you I never saw the sun

1781
01:39:17,994 --> 01:39:19,829
Shining so bright

1782
01:39:19,871 --> 01:39:22,415
Never saw things going so right

1783
01:39:22,499 --> 01:39:25,377
Noticing the days hurrying by

1784
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:28,129
When you're in love, my how they fly

1785
01:39:28,213 --> 01:39:31,258
Blue days

1786
01:39:31,341 --> 01:39:33,760
All of them, all of them gone

1787
01:39:33,843 --> 01:39:50,068
Nothing but blue skies from now on

1788
01:39:50,151 --> 01:39:52,988
Now on

1789
01:39:53,029 --> 01:40:01,246
Nothing but blue skies.
