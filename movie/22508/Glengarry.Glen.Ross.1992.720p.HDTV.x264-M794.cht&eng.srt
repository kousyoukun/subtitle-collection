Nothing but blue skies do I see

1777
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:07,150
In the morning there's bluebirds

1778
01:39:07,233 --> 01:39:10,654
Singing a song

1779
01:39:10,737 --> 01:39:15,492
Nothing but, nothing but bluebirds from now on

1780
01:39:15,575 --> 01:39:17,953
Let me tell you I never saw the sun

1781
01:39:17,994 --> 01:39:19,829
Shining so bright

1782
01:39:19,871 --> 01:39:22,415
Never saw things going so right

1783
01:39:22,499 --> 01:39:25,377
Noticing the days hurrying by

1784
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:28,129
When you're in love, my how they fly

1785
01:39:28,213 --> 01:39:31,258
Blue days

1786
01:39:31,341 --> 01:39:33,760
All of them, all of them gone

1787
01:39:33,843 --> 01:39:50,068
Nothing but blue skies from now on

1788
01:39:50,151 --> 01:39:52,988
Now on

1789
01:39:53,029 --> 01:40:01,246
Nothing but blue skies.
