1
00:02:34,515 --> 00:02:37,143
2306, please.

2
00:02:40,897 --> 00:02:42,982
Hello, honey.
How you doing?

3
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:46,944
Good.
What did he say?

4
00:02:47,028 --> 00:02:51,574
Uh-huh. Is he still there?
How long ago did he leave?

5
00:02:51,658 --> 00:02:55,536
Uh-huh. I'm stopping here,
then I got a little meeting,

6
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,247
and then I'll -
I would if I could.

7
00:02:58,331 --> 00:03:01,459
As soon as I can.
Let me get off and I -

8
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:05,755
let me get off and I prom -
I promise you it'll be okay.

9
00:03:07,548 --> 00:03:11,636
A bunch of bullshit.
Waste a good man's time.

10
00:03:18,935 --> 00:03:21,896
Hi, could I speak
to Dr. Lowenstein, please?

11
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:24,607
It's rather important.
Could you get him for me?

12
00:03:24,691 --> 00:03:27,360
Bunch of bullshit trying to make
a living on these deadbeat leads.

13
00:03:27,443 --> 00:03:29,904
I swear to God, Shel,
I'm on a sit today -

14
00:03:29,946 --> 00:03:33,199
Hello, Mrs. Swoboda,
this is Dave Moss.

15
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:35,284
Yeah, we spoke yesterday.

16
00:03:35,368 --> 00:03:39,122
Now on the Rio Rancho Estates,
we've had a situation just come up.

17
00:03:39,205 --> 00:03:41,791
The president of our company
is in town just one day,

18
00:03:41,874 --> 00:03:44,168
- and he has certain parcels -
- Doctor -

19
00:03:44,252 --> 00:03:47,255
well, could you get -
what do you mean?

20
00:03:47,338 --> 00:03:50,049
He's not there?
I have to speak to him.

21
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:54,095
Yes, it is fairly urgent.
Mr. Levene.

22
00:03:54,137 --> 00:03:58,391
No, I can't be reached.
I'll get back to him.

23
00:03:58,474 --> 00:04:00,685
He has certain parcels -
certain choice parcels

24
00:04:00,768 --> 00:04:03,229
which he's given me
a hold on for the next 48 hours.

25
00:04:03,312 --> 00:04:06,274
What would be the best time to get
you and your husband together?

26
00:04:06,315 --> 00:04:11,321
Say, tonight, at 10:00,
or tomorrow at 8:00?

27
00:04:11,362 --> 00:04:13,865
Okay.

28
00:04:13,948 --> 00:04:16,534
Okay, what would be
the best time to do that?

29
00:04:18,453 --> 00:04:21,914
Look, you sent in the -
no, no, listen to me now -

30
00:04:21,956 --> 00:04:24,709
I've got 48 hours
to make you a lot of money.

31
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:30,423
Well, when will he be home?
Fine, I'll call you back in 10 minutes.

32
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,677
They don't give you the leads,
they don't give you the support,

33
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:36,596
- they don't give you dick.
- Yeah.

34
00:04:36,637 --> 00:04:38,639
Then they're yanking us in
on some sales conference.

35
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:41,809
When's the last time anybody
learned a goddamn thing?

36
00:04:41,851 --> 00:04:44,270
All it does is some jerk
shoots his mouth off.

37
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,359
I swear to God, Shel, I got half a mind
to go across the street.

38
00:04:49,442 --> 00:04:51,944
I got half a mind to go
with you if they'd take me.

39
00:04:51,986 --> 00:04:56,157
You never know - I was talking
to Jerry Graff last week.

40
00:04:57,825 --> 00:05:00,411
I got to call
these deadbeats back.

41
00:05:01,496 --> 00:05:03,706
I can't make a goddamn
dollar with these leads,

42
00:05:03,748 --> 00:05:05,625
and you're killing my ass
on the street.

43
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:08,002
- I'm sorry you aren't happy here.
- That's cute,

44
00:05:08,086 --> 00:05:10,588
but you're running this office
like a bunch of bullshit.

45
00:05:10,672 --> 00:05:12,799
You're on an override -
you make money, we make money.

46
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,885
- I'd like you to make more money.
- Then don't go waste my time.

47
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:18,638
- A sales conference?
- The strategy comes from downtown.

48
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,973
Oh, the strategy?
The strategy?

49
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:23,101
- Well, I think I'll pass.
- I wouldn't.

50
00:05:23,184 --> 00:05:26,020
- Why is that?
- When you come, then you'll see.

51
00:05:26,104 --> 00:05:29,148
- Shelly.
- John.

52
00:05:29,232 --> 00:05:31,317
Are you ready
to do or die tonight?

53
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:33,319
Oh yeah,
always ready, John.

54
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:35,697
Always ready, John.
Now, one thing -

55
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,740
we were talking about the leads.
We got some new ones?

56
00:05:37,824 --> 00:05:40,076
That's what we're going
to talk about at the meeting.

57
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,578
We are? Because I'm running
into a bit of a snag.

58
00:05:42,662 --> 00:05:44,414
Yes, I've seen
your sales figures.

59
00:05:44,497 --> 00:05:46,541
That's the leads.
You give me a better lead -

60
00:05:46,624 --> 00:05:48,668
That's what we're going
to be talking about.

61
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:50,545
I'm in a bind -
personal problems.

62
00:05:50,628 --> 00:05:52,422
- I could use a leg up.
- After the meeting.

63
00:05:52,463 --> 00:05:55,675
- I hear the new Glengarry leads -
- After the meeting, Shel.

64
00:05:55,717 --> 00:05:57,677
- Hey, Ricky.
- Hello, John.

65
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:00,304
- Wet out there tonight.
- Huh?

66
00:06:00,388 --> 00:06:04,851
- Wet out there tonight.
- Uh-huh.

67
00:06:04,934 --> 00:06:07,103
- Maybe it'll break the heat.
- Yeah.

68
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:13,943
Al, give me a quick J&B, huh?
Double.

69
00:06:14,027 --> 00:06:15,778
Cutty, Al.

70
00:06:18,865 --> 00:06:21,367
- They say...
- Huh?

71
00:06:21,451 --> 00:06:25,204
they say it was so hot
downtown this afternoon,

72
00:06:25,288 --> 00:06:29,792
grown men on the street corner
were going up to cops

73
00:06:29,876 --> 00:06:32,545
begging the cops
to shoot them.

74
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:37,425
They say you should not drink
alcohol when it's so hot.

75
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:41,763
- Who says that?
- Something I read.

76
00:06:41,846 --> 00:06:45,183
For they say
it dehydrates you.

77
00:06:45,266 --> 00:06:48,102
They say
you should drink water,

78
00:06:48,144 --> 00:06:52,315
but I subscribe to the law
of contrary public opinion.

79
00:06:53,274 --> 00:06:56,736
If everyone thinks one thing,
then I say bet the other way.

80
00:06:57,987 --> 00:06:59,947
Added to which,
you know they're wrong.

81
00:07:00,031 --> 00:07:02,492
That's what I'm saying.

82
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,123
- Slow tonight.
- Oh, yeah.

83
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:11,292
Well, I guess
everybody's staying home.

84
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:13,670
If my daughter calls,
anybody calls,

85
00:07:13,753 --> 00:07:17,298
I'm over at the office.
Thanks.

86
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,750
I had a woman
in White Plains on the hook -

87
00:07:52,834 --> 00:07:55,795
five units, Mountain View -
what happens?

88
00:07:55,837 --> 00:07:57,672
She has to check
with her lawyer.

89
00:07:57,755 --> 00:08:00,299
- You let her check with her lawyer?
- What could I do?

90
00:08:00,383 --> 00:08:02,927
- I dunno.
- Shelly.

91
00:08:03,011 --> 00:08:05,096
- Huh?
- Who's the guy?

92
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:07,098
Couldn't tell you.

93
00:08:07,181 --> 00:08:10,852
I don't like the whole thing,
because all I need is a lead.

94
00:08:10,935 --> 00:08:12,645
- They won't give out -
- Uh-huh.

95
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:15,314
The rich get richer,
that's the law of the land.

96
00:08:15,398 --> 00:08:17,567
Who belongs
to the BM -?

97
00:08:22,822 --> 00:08:24,699
It is 7:30.

98
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:26,909
So who is that?

99
00:08:27,994 --> 00:08:29,912
And where is
Mr. Roma?

100
00:08:29,996 --> 00:08:31,664
Well, I'm not a leash,
so I don't know, do I?

101
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:36,794
Let me have
your attention for a moment.

102
00:08:36,878 --> 00:08:40,089
You're talking about what?
You're talking about -

103
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:43,509
bitching about
that sale you shot,

104
00:08:43,593 --> 00:08:45,803
some son of a bitch
don't want to buy land,

105
00:08:45,887 --> 00:08:47,221
somebody don't want
what you're selling,

106
00:08:47,263 --> 00:08:49,223
some broad you're
trying to screw, so forth.

107
00:08:49,265 --> 00:08:51,351
Let's talk
about something important.

108
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:53,061
- Are they all here?
- All but one.

109
00:08:53,102 --> 00:08:54,103
I'm going anyway.

110
00:08:54,145 --> 00:08:57,690
Let's talk
about something important.

111
00:08:57,774 --> 00:09:00,151
Put that coffee down.

112
00:09:04,739 --> 00:09:07,742
Coffee's for closers only.

113
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:12,622
You think
I'm fucking with you?

114
00:09:16,084 --> 00:09:17,877
I am not fucking with you.

115
00:09:18,586 --> 00:09:20,797
I'm here from downtown.

116
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,423
I'm here
from Mitch and Murray.

117
00:09:22,507 --> 00:09:25,677
And I'm here
on a mission of mercy.

118
00:09:29,597 --> 00:09:33,059
- Your name's Levene?
- Yeah.

119
00:09:33,142 --> 00:09:36,938
You call yourself a salesman,
you son of a bitch?

120
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:38,731
I don't got to listen
to this shit.

121
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:42,068
You certainly don't, 'cause
the good news is, you're fired.

122
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:46,614
The bad news is you've got -
all of you've got -

123
00:09:46,698 --> 00:09:48,700
just one week
to regain your jobs,

124
00:09:48,783 --> 00:09:52,245
starting with tonight -
starting with tonight's sit.

125
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:58,126
Oh, have I got
your attention now?

126
00:10:00,878 --> 00:10:02,046
Good...

127
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:05,216
'cause we're adding
a little something

128
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:06,926
to this month's
sales contest.

129
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,096
As you all know, first prize
is a Cadillac Eldorado.

130
00:10:10,138 --> 00:10:12,181
Anybody want to see
second prize?

131
00:10:12,265 --> 00:10:15,685
Second prize is
a set of steak knives.

132
00:10:18,229 --> 00:10:20,565
Third prize is you're fired.

133
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:27,989
Do you get the picture?
Are you laughing now?

134
00:10:28,072 --> 00:10:32,493
You got leads. Mitch and Murray
paid good money.

135
00:10:32,535 --> 00:10:34,704
Get their names
to sell them.

136
00:10:34,787 --> 00:10:36,789
You can't close
the leads you're given,

137
00:10:36,873 --> 00:10:39,542
you can't close shit,
you are shit!

138
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:43,129
Hit the bricks, pal, and beat it,
'cause you are going out!

139
00:10:43,212 --> 00:10:46,674
- The leads are weak.
- The leads are weak?

140
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:49,469
The fucking leads are weak?
You're weak.

141
00:10:49,552 --> 00:10:51,512
I've been
in this business 15 years.

142
00:10:51,596 --> 00:10:53,890
- What's your name?
- Fuck you -

143
00:10:53,973 --> 00:10:56,476
that's my name!
You know why, mister?

144
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:58,686
Because you drove a Hyundai
to get here tonight,

145
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:03,691
I drove an $80,000 BMW.
That's my name.

146
00:11:07,904 --> 00:11:10,990
And your name
is "You're wanting."

147
00:11:11,074 --> 00:11:14,243
You can't play in the man's game?
You can't close them?

148
00:11:14,327 --> 00:11:17,705
Then go home and tell your wife
your troubles.

149
00:11:18,748 --> 00:11:21,501
Because only one thing
counts in this life -

150
00:11:21,584 --> 00:11:24,962
get them to sign
on the line which is dotted!

151
00:11:25,046 --> 00:11:27,965
You hear me,
you fucking faggots?

152
00:11:35,223 --> 00:11:37,642
"A-B-C."

153
00:11:37,725 --> 00:11:40,687
A - Always,
B - Be, C - Closing.

154
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,730
Always Be Closing.

155
00:11:42,772 --> 00:11:46,442
"Always Be Closing."

156
00:11:47,402 --> 00:11:49,195
"A-I-D-A."

157
00:11:49,237 --> 00:11:51,948
"Attention, Interest,
Decision, Action."

158
00:11:52,031 --> 00:11:54,492
Attention -
Do I have your attention?

159
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:56,703
Interest -
Are you interested?

160
00:11:56,744 --> 00:11:59,038
I know you are,
because it's fuck or walk.

161
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,082
You close
or you hit the bricks.

162
00:12:01,165 --> 00:12:05,378
Decision - Have you made
your decision for Christ?

163
00:12:05,461 --> 00:12:10,133
And Action.
"A-I-D-A."

164
00:12:10,216 --> 00:12:12,510
Get out there -
you got the prospects coming in.

165
00:12:12,593 --> 00:12:14,721
You think they came in
to get out of the rain?

166
00:12:14,804 --> 00:12:17,223
A guy don't walk on the lot
lest he wants to buy.

167
00:12:17,265 --> 00:12:20,560
They're sitting out there
waiting to give you their money.

168
00:12:20,643 --> 00:12:22,687
Are you gonna take it?

169
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,898
Are you man enough
to take it?

170
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:34,324
Crap.

171
00:12:34,407 --> 00:12:36,284
What's the problem, pal?
You - Moss.

172
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:38,828
You're such a hero,
you're so rich,

173
00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:42,165
how come you're here wasting
your time with a bunch of bums?

174
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:46,794
You see this watch?

175
00:12:49,464 --> 00:12:53,217
- You see this watch?
- Yeah.

176
00:12:53,301 --> 00:12:56,471
That watch costs
more than your car.

177
00:12:56,554 --> 00:13:00,600
I made $$70,000 last year.
How much you make?

178
00:13:02,643 --> 00:13:08,024
You see, pal... that's who I am,
and you're nothing.

179
00:13:08,107 --> 00:13:11,986
Nice guy?
I don't give a shit.

180
00:13:12,028 --> 00:13:16,032
Good father? Fuck you -
go home and play with your kids.

181
00:13:16,115 --> 00:13:20,620
You want to work here -
close!

182
00:13:20,703 --> 00:13:23,956
You think this is abuse?

183
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,125
You think this is abuse,
you cocksucker?

184
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:29,837
You can't take this, how can you
take the abuse you get on a sit?

185
00:13:30,922 --> 00:13:34,425
You don't like it, leave.

186
00:13:36,386 --> 00:13:39,806
I can go out there tonight -
the materials you got -

187
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:43,976
make myself $15,000.
Tonight - in two hours!

188
00:13:44,018 --> 00:13:45,853
Can you?

189
00:13:46,938 --> 00:13:49,649
Can you?

190
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:54,612
Go and do likewise.
"A-I-D-A."

191
00:13:54,696 --> 00:13:57,281
Get mad, you son of a bitches.
Get mad!

192
00:13:57,365 --> 00:14:01,285
You know what it takes
to sell real estate?

193
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:05,039
It takes brass balls
to sell real estate.

194
00:14:09,711 --> 00:14:12,380
Go and do likewise,
gents.

195
00:14:12,463 --> 00:14:14,882
The money's out there -
you pick it up, it's yours,

196
00:14:14,924 --> 00:14:17,218
you don't,
I got no sympathy for you.

197
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:19,137
You want to go out
on those sits tonight and close -

198
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,930
close - it's yours.

199
00:14:21,014 --> 00:14:23,182
Not, you're gonna be
shining my shoes.

200
00:14:23,224 --> 00:14:25,977
And you know
what you'll be saying.

201
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,688
Bunch of losers
sitting around in a bar,

202
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:32,859
"Oh yeah, I used to be a salesman.
It's a tough racket."

203
00:14:41,576 --> 00:14:43,995
These are the new leads.

204
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,123
These are
the Glengarry leads.

205
00:14:47,206 --> 00:14:51,878
And to you, they're gold.
And you don't get them.

206
00:14:51,961 --> 00:14:54,714
Why?

207
00:14:54,797 --> 00:14:58,801
Because to give them to you
is just throwing them away.

208
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:05,266
They're for closers.

209
00:15:11,314 --> 00:15:12,565
I'd wish you good luck,

210
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:14,901
but you wouldn't know what
to do with it if you got it.

211
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:24,077
And to answer your question, pal -
"Why am I here?"

212
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,121
I came here because
Mitch and Murray asked me to.

213
00:15:27,205 --> 00:15:29,916
They asked me for a favor.
I said, "The real favor -

214
00:15:29,957 --> 00:15:32,960
follow my advice
and fire your fucking ass,

215
00:15:33,044 --> 00:15:35,546
because a loser
is a loser."

216
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:49,143
Bunch of fucking nonsense -

217
00:15:49,227 --> 00:15:51,938
treat people like that.

218
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:56,651
The fuck is he going
to get off?

219
00:15:56,734 --> 00:16:00,113
- Mickey Mouse sales conference.
- He didn't mean it.

220
00:16:00,154 --> 00:16:03,032
I'm sure he didn't mean it about
trimming down the sales quota.

221
00:16:03,116 --> 00:16:05,284
Where is Roma?
Where the hell is Mr. Ricky Roma?

222
00:16:05,368 --> 00:16:07,745
All the while we got to sit here,
eat this nonsense?

223
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:10,957
Hello? Mr. Levene.
How's she doing?

224
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:13,001
Uh-huh, yeah.
Is she awake?

225
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:15,628
Oh, the doctor came by.
What did he say?

226
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:19,257
Uh-huh.
I can't come in tonight.

227
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,093
I think - I know she is.
I know that she is.

228
00:16:22,176 --> 00:16:26,014
I've gotta go out. Will you please
tell her when she wakes?

229
00:16:26,097 --> 00:16:30,059
I've got to go out.
Tell her I'll call her from the road.

230
00:16:30,143 --> 00:16:31,728
Thank you.

231
00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:37,150
Gentlemen,
you heard the man.

232
00:16:37,191 --> 00:16:38,985
What is this in aid of?

233
00:16:39,068 --> 00:16:41,154
- As of tonight -
- What is this? Excuse me.

234
00:16:41,237 --> 00:16:43,406
What it's in aid of
is that Mitch and Murray -

235
00:16:43,489 --> 00:16:46,200
Fuck Mitch and Murray!
I'm doing my job,

236
00:16:46,284 --> 00:16:48,077
I got to put up
with this childishness?

237
00:16:48,161 --> 00:16:50,038
I don't make the rules.
I'm paid to run the office.

238
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,457
You don't like the rules, Dave?
There's the door!

239
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:58,963
Two lead cards for tonight,
two lead cards for tomorrow.

240
00:16:59,047 --> 00:17:00,757
As you heard,
end of the month,

241
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,925
top salesman on the board
gets the Eldorado.

242
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:05,136
- Next man down the -
- What about the good leads?

243
00:17:05,219 --> 00:17:07,555
- The leads I've given you.
- But these leads are shit.

244
00:17:07,638 --> 00:17:09,474
They're old -
I've seen that name 100 times.

245
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:12,685
- The leads are assigned randomly.
- What about the new leads?

246
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:14,562
The new leads -
the Glengarry leads.

247
00:17:14,645 --> 00:17:16,981
I've got them.
I'm going to hang onto them.

248
00:17:17,065 --> 00:17:19,150
And they'll be
assigned to closers,

249
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:21,569
based on the sales volume,
first to Roma.

250
00:17:21,653 --> 00:17:23,571
- Where is Roma?
- Don't worry about Roma.

251
00:17:23,655 --> 00:17:25,281
He'll get his leads,
you've got yours.

252
00:17:25,365 --> 00:17:27,492
He's top name on the board,
so he don't have to be here?

253
00:17:27,575 --> 00:17:30,036
That's correct!
And as the hour is waning,

254
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:32,955
I suggest you - those of you
who are interested

255
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,833
in a continuing job with
this organization, get to work.

256
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:37,919
That's garbage.
Bullshit.

257
00:17:38,002 --> 00:17:39,712
- Thank you for your attention.
- Bullshit!

258
00:17:39,754 --> 00:17:43,883
How am I supposed to close these?
Look at this.

259
00:17:43,966 --> 00:17:46,928
I've had this guy before.
I've been to his house twice.

260
00:17:47,011 --> 00:17:50,723
I - I can't -
I can't close this stuff.

261
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:56,479
Shelly, how am I
supposed to -

262
00:17:56,562 --> 00:17:59,232
They're going
to bounce me out of a job.

263
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,827
Hello, Mr. Palermo?
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,288
Mr. Speice?
Mr. Robert Speice?

265
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,291
Yeah,
this is George Aaronow.

266
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,461
I'm with Rio.
I spoke with your wife earlier.

267
00:18:20,545 --> 00:18:24,090
I'm the vice president of Rio Rancho
Properties in Furman, Arizona.

268
00:18:24,132 --> 00:18:29,387
Yes. I'm calling from the airport,
and consulting my map,

269
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,681
I see that you and your wife
live near the airport.

270
00:18:31,764 --> 00:18:34,767
I have some rather -
rather unusual,

271
00:18:34,851 --> 00:18:37,103
rather good information
on the property...

272
00:18:37,145 --> 00:18:41,566
Hello? Hello, this is
Sheldon Levene.

273
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:44,277
Please listen closely -
I only have a moment or so.

274
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:47,947
I can speak only
to a Mrs. Nyborg.

275
00:18:47,989 --> 00:18:51,951
Oh, this is Mrs. Nyborg.
Please listen closely, Mrs. Nyborg.

276
00:18:52,035 --> 00:18:55,747
I'm calling from Consolidated
Properties of Arizona.

277
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,542
Our computer has chosen you
from all of the many thousands

278
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,462
who write in requesting
information on our properties.

279
00:19:02,503 --> 00:19:05,506
Now by federal law,
as you probably know,

280
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,801
the prize must be awarded to you
even if you are not engaged

281
00:19:08,885 --> 00:19:10,887
in our land
development plan.

282
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,599
The only stipulation, of course,
is that you and your husband

283
00:19:14,682 --> 00:19:17,810
must sign at the same time
for the receipt of your prize.

284
00:19:17,894 --> 00:19:22,315
Now, I will be in the area
tonight, possibly tomorrow.

285
00:19:22,357 --> 00:19:24,942
What do you think might be
a convenient time to meet

286
00:19:25,026 --> 00:19:27,153
with both you
and your husband?

287
00:19:27,195 --> 00:19:29,822
Of course I'll hold.

288
00:19:43,002 --> 00:19:45,672
- Bunch of fucking nonsense, huh?
- I can't close them.

289
00:19:45,713 --> 00:19:47,256
- Nobody can close 'em.
- They're old.

290
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,509
They're ancient -
a bunch of fucking nonsense.

291
00:19:49,592 --> 00:19:51,886
Get some jerk
to come in here -

292
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:54,764
Sometimes I think,
"I wonder if I belong in this business."

293
00:19:54,847 --> 00:19:57,225
Send a guy out there -
no support, no confidence.

294
00:19:57,266 --> 00:19:59,936
Then I say,
"Nobody can close 'em."

295
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:02,522
- Then I look at Roma.
- Roma - fuck Roma.

296
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:04,691
Had a freak -
a little run of luck.

297
00:20:04,732 --> 00:20:07,193
The leads are garbage.

298
00:20:07,235 --> 00:20:09,362
Then I say,
"Why give him the good leads?

299
00:20:09,404 --> 00:20:11,531
- He doesn't need 'em."
- You going out?

300
00:20:11,614 --> 00:20:16,202
Yeah. I have to go out.
I can't make a sit.

301
00:20:16,285 --> 00:20:20,206
- Have you tried?
- Yeah. Something's wrong with me.

302
00:20:20,248 --> 00:20:22,250
What is it?
I can't push through.

303
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,544
Get your coat on.
You're coming out with me.

304
00:20:24,585 --> 00:20:26,713
- Something in me.
- Forget it.

305
00:20:26,754 --> 00:20:29,841
- I try, I try.
- I said forget it, come on.

306
00:20:29,924 --> 00:20:32,176
I can't close 'em.

307
00:20:35,763 --> 00:20:37,432
Life.

308
00:20:37,515 --> 00:20:39,726
I swear to God,
you work all your life -

309
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:43,896
- Forget it, George.
- Roma, so on...

310
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,399
- so gifted.
- Gifted, my ass!

311
00:20:46,441 --> 00:20:50,028
- The guy gets a string of luck.
- No, no, no.

312
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:51,779
The thing of it is,
money's tight.

313
00:20:51,863 --> 00:20:53,740
When times are tight,
it don't do no good

314
00:20:53,781 --> 00:20:56,159
to throw around,
"Just go out and sell."

315
00:20:56,242 --> 00:20:58,953
Threaten a man all you want,
you can't whip a dead horse.

316
00:20:59,037 --> 00:21:00,580
- Nope.
- All this garbage -

317
00:21:00,621 --> 00:21:02,123
"Sell 10,000,
you win a Cadillac;

318
00:21:02,206 --> 00:21:05,501
you lose, we're gonna fire
your ass"? It's medieval.

319
00:21:05,585 --> 00:21:06,753
- Yes.
- It's wrong.

320
00:21:06,836 --> 00:21:08,296
- Yes.
- Yes it is,

321
00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:09,922
and you know
who's responsible?

322
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:11,966
- Who?
- You know who it is.

323
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:13,926
It's Mitch and Murray,
'cause it don't have to be this way.

324
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:16,012
- No.
- Look at Jerry Graff.

325
00:21:16,054 --> 00:21:18,097
He's clean, he's doing
business for himself,

326
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:20,308
he's got that list -
with the nurses?

327
00:21:28,441 --> 00:21:31,069
For nothing.
For some jerk in the office,

328
00:21:31,152 --> 00:21:33,488
telling us, "Get out there and close,
go win a Cadillac."

329
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:36,157
Graff goes out and buys.
He pays top dollar.

330
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,659
- You see?
- Yes.

331
00:21:37,742 --> 00:21:40,703
For the leads - that's thinking.
Now, he's got the leads,

332
00:21:40,787 --> 00:21:44,957
he goes in business for himself.
That's what? That's thinking.

333
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,001
Who - who's got
a steady job,

334
00:21:47,043 --> 00:21:49,170
a regular job,
a couple of bucks nobody's touched?

335
00:21:49,253 --> 00:21:50,755
Nurses.

336
00:21:50,838 --> 00:21:52,465
Graff goes and buys
a fucking list of nurses. One grand -

337
00:21:52,507 --> 00:21:54,884
he paid two, I'll eat my hat.
4,000 or 5,000 nurses.

338
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:57,345
- He's going wild.
- He is?

339
00:21:57,428 --> 00:22:00,640
- Yeah, he's doing very well.
- I heard they were running cold.

340
00:22:00,723 --> 00:22:02,517
- The nurses?
- Yeah.

341
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,770
You hear a lot of things.
He's doing very well.

342
00:22:05,853 --> 00:22:07,689
- With River Oaks?
- River Oaks, Brook Farms.

343
00:22:07,772 --> 00:22:10,483
All that shit. Somebody told me -
you know what he's clearing, himself?

344
00:22:10,525 --> 00:22:13,319
- 14, 15 grand a week.
- Himself?

345
00:22:13,403 --> 00:22:16,739
That's what I'm saying.
Why? He's got the leads.

346
00:22:16,823 --> 00:22:19,867
He's got the good leads.
What are we?

347
00:22:19,951 --> 00:22:21,703
We're sitting
in the shit here. Why?

348
00:22:21,786 --> 00:22:23,621
Because we got to go to them
to get them.

349
00:22:23,705 --> 00:22:26,582
$0%%of our sales we're paying
to the office for the leads.

350
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:30,086
There's our leads, there's overhead,
phones, a lot of stuff.

351
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:32,130
What do you need?
A telephone?

352
00:22:32,213 --> 00:22:35,341
Some broad to say, "Good morning"?
Nothing. It's the leads.

353
00:22:35,425 --> 00:22:37,719
The whole thing is the leads,
you understand me?

354
00:22:37,802 --> 00:22:40,596
You can't sell to a void -
you got to get a goddamn person.

355
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,224
You get a lead, you get
a person - I'll go sell 'em.

356
00:22:43,307 --> 00:22:45,101
Otherwise, what do they want
from my life?

357
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,188
Hello, Danny?
Dan, it's Shel Levene.

358
00:22:49,272 --> 00:22:52,317
Yeah, we spoke -
last May I called you.

359
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,570
I was in town from my estate
in Rio Rancho, and -

360
00:22:55,653 --> 00:22:57,363
Arizona.

361
00:22:57,447 --> 00:22:59,699
I wish we could have
gotten together at that time.

362
00:22:59,741 --> 00:23:03,536
Danny, that piece of property I had
for you has increased in value -

363
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:08,833
Grace, Grace,
what was that figure? $76,000.

364
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:11,377
Oh, Danny, I wish you could have
been in on it with me.

365
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:14,047
Look, I'm here overnight -
I have to go home tomorrow,

366
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:17,967
and I thought, after the interest
you showed on the last trip, that -

367
00:23:18,051 --> 00:23:21,929
Hold it, Grace. Danny,
I know that you're serious,

368
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:25,058
and because of that, I am going
to shove my appointments around

369
00:23:25,141 --> 00:23:29,187
and make sure -
oh, gee, I wish that -

370
00:23:30,605 --> 00:23:34,233
All right, Danny.
Yeah, all right.

371
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:48,081
Going out tonight,
Shelly?

372
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:53,920
What is this bullshit
with the sales promotion?

373
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:55,463
It isn't bullshit.
It's the way it is.

374
00:23:55,546 --> 00:23:57,632
You're going to fire
the bottom men on the list?

375
00:23:57,715 --> 00:24:00,134
That's the way it is
and I don't make the rules.

376
00:24:00,176 --> 00:24:03,513
- The rules come from downtown.
- I got a problem here, John.

377
00:24:03,596 --> 00:24:06,099
- I'm closing up the office.
- Come have a drink with me.

378
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,435
- I've got to get home.
- Do me the courtesy - five minutes?

379
00:24:09,477 --> 00:24:11,646
I am trying to get home
for two hours.

380
00:24:11,729 --> 00:24:14,732
I got to go home, grab one hour
with my kids, come back here,

381
00:24:14,816 --> 00:24:17,276
see if any of you closed
a contract, take the contract -

382
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,905
- How about one minute?
- What is it?

383
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:23,032
- I can't close these leads.
- Then move on.

384
00:24:23,116 --> 00:24:26,995
Don't jump! Don't jump out
of your manager bag a second.

385
00:24:27,036 --> 00:24:31,290
It's just two guys talking,
am I right? We're just talking.

386
00:24:31,374 --> 00:24:33,960
You got the new leads.
If you would give me - just hold on.

387
00:24:34,043 --> 00:24:36,796
The Glengarry leads are to be
assigned only to closers.

388
00:24:36,879 --> 00:24:39,632
Hold on a second.
If you give me the good leads -

389
00:24:39,674 --> 00:24:41,300
You blew the last good one
I gave you.

390
00:24:41,384 --> 00:24:43,052
No, no - hold on,
will you?

391
00:24:43,136 --> 00:24:45,722
I did not blow 'em.
One kicked out. One, I closed.

392
00:24:45,805 --> 00:24:47,682
- You didn't close it.
- Would you listen to me?

393
00:24:47,765 --> 00:24:51,561
I closed that cocksucker!
His ex! John, his ex!

394
00:24:51,644 --> 00:24:54,105
I didn't even know he was married.
The judge invalidated it.

395
00:24:54,188 --> 00:24:55,064
Shelly -

396
00:24:55,148 --> 00:24:57,692
What was that job, huh?
Bad luck. That's all it was.

397
00:24:57,775 --> 00:24:59,986
I pray you never find it -
it runs in streaks.

398
00:25:00,028 --> 00:25:02,947
That's what it's doing,
that's all it does - streaks.

399
00:25:03,031 --> 00:25:06,617
I pray that it misses you
and that's all I have to say.

400
00:25:06,701 --> 00:25:09,662
Shit, I've got to eat.
Williamson -

401
00:25:09,746 --> 00:25:13,875
look at the sheets.
Look at the sheets.

402
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:17,670
1$87, '88, '8$ -
six months in '8$ - who's on top?

403
00:25:17,712 --> 00:25:19,213
- Roma.
- Under him?

404
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:22,008
- Moss.
- Oh, bullshit, John!

405
00:25:22,091 --> 00:25:24,677
April to September it's me -
it's no fucking Moss.

406
00:25:24,761 --> 00:25:27,096
Due respect,
he's an order-taker.

407
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,850
Talk - talks a good game,
but look on the board, it's me.

408
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:33,102
- Not lately it isn't.
- Not late -

409
00:25:33,895 --> 00:25:35,563
Well, lately -
kiss my ass "lately."

410
00:25:35,647 --> 00:25:38,316
You call Murray and you call Mitch -
when we were on Peterson,

411
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:41,027
who do you think bought the new car?
Call Mitch. The Seville?

412
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:44,197
He came in here -
"You bought that for me, fella."

413
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,201
And out of what? Hey, look at me!
Out of what? Nothing!

414
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:50,495
Cold calling.
You want to talk about a sale?

415
00:25:50,578 --> 00:25:53,081
You are really
beginning to burn my ass, kid.

416
00:25:53,164 --> 00:25:57,502
I can't get a lead, you -
it was skill, John.

417
00:25:57,585 --> 00:26:00,046
It could be working for you -
you want to throw it away.

418
00:26:00,088 --> 00:26:02,298
- It isn't me.
- It's not you -

419
00:26:02,382 --> 00:26:04,884
I wonder who it is.
Who the fuck am I talking to?

420
00:26:04,967 --> 00:26:08,721
- I need the leads to sell.
- After the contest. After the 30th.

421
00:26:08,805 --> 00:26:11,057
Bullshit,
"After the contest."

422
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:13,810
If I'm not on that board by the 30th,
they're going to can my ass.

423
00:26:17,021 --> 00:26:20,608
I need those leads
and I need 'em now or I'm out.

424
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:31,536
You're going to miss me.
I swear to you, you will miss me.

425
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:33,371
Let me tell you
something, Shelly.

426
00:26:33,454 --> 00:26:36,457
I do what I'm hired to do -
you might do the same.

427
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:38,418
- Jesus.
- Now wait a second!

428
00:26:40,044 --> 00:26:43,965
I'm hired to watch the leads,
to marshal my sales force.

429
00:26:44,007 --> 00:26:46,134
I'm given a policy.
My job is to do that.

430
00:26:46,217 --> 00:26:48,261
Marshal your sales force?

431
00:26:48,344 --> 00:26:51,014
Anybody falls below
a certain mark, I'm directed.

432
00:26:51,097 --> 00:26:53,057
I'm not permitted
to give them the premium leads.

433
00:26:53,141 --> 00:26:57,103
How do they rise
above that mark? With dreck?

434
00:26:57,145 --> 00:26:59,480
With this toilet paper
you're giving me?

435
00:26:59,564 --> 00:27:01,149
You give me
one premium lead -

436
00:27:01,232 --> 00:27:02,942
Do you know what
the premium leads cost?

437
00:27:02,984 --> 00:27:05,278
Do I know what
the premium leads cost?

438
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,779
Yeah,
I know what they cost.

439
00:27:06,821 --> 00:27:10,074
I generated the sufficient
dollar revenue to buy them.

440
00:27:10,158 --> 00:27:13,119
But I cannot sell shit!

441
00:27:13,202 --> 00:27:15,788
Jesus. And I've seen
these before, you know.

442
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,790
Christ, I saw these back -
Homestead -

443
00:27:17,832 --> 00:27:20,168
1$85, we pitched
these cocksuckers Baywater.

444
00:27:20,251 --> 00:27:24,547
They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.
They're broke. They're deadbeats.

445
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:27,550
Just give me some leads that don't
come out of a phone book.

446
00:27:27,633 --> 00:27:30,303
You give me something hotter
than that and I can close it.

447
00:27:30,386 --> 00:27:32,597
It's just a streak.
I'm gonna turn it around.

448
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,933
Hey, I need your help.

449
00:27:38,061 --> 00:27:40,897
I can't do it,
Shelly.

450
00:27:46,235 --> 00:27:48,446
John...

451
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:51,157
I'll give you 10%%.

452
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,826
- Of what?
- My end - what I close.

453
00:27:53,868 --> 00:27:56,829
You give me the premium leads,
you're in for 10%%, what I close.

454
00:27:56,871 --> 00:27:58,748
- And what if you don't close?
- I will.

455
00:27:58,831 --> 00:28:00,833
- What if you don't close?
- I will close.

456
00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:03,002
What if you don't,
you understand?

457
00:28:03,086 --> 00:28:06,005
Then I'm fucked. You think you're
the only guy with a family?

458
00:28:06,047 --> 00:28:07,799
- You see what I'm saying?
- John -

459
00:28:07,882 --> 00:28:10,134
I step out and you don't close,
then it's my job.

460
00:28:10,218 --> 00:28:12,178
- Then I'm fucked.
- I will close!

461
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,972
Now, 10%%John -
I can get hot, you know that.

462
00:28:15,056 --> 00:28:17,600
- Not lately you can't.
- That's defeatist - fuck it!

463
00:28:17,684 --> 00:28:20,603
Go with me. Get on my side
and let's do something.

464
00:28:20,687 --> 00:28:23,356
You want to run this office?
You heard what the man said -

465
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:25,858
"Attack."
Let's do something.

466
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:30,321
- Huh?
- 20%%.

467
00:28:31,739 --> 00:28:34,367
- All right.
- And 50 bucks a lead.

468
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:36,411
- No?
- Oh!

469
00:28:43,292 --> 00:28:45,044
Oh, shit.

470
00:28:58,516 --> 00:29:02,812
Listen...
I got to talk to you.

471
00:29:02,895 --> 00:29:07,775
Permit me to do this a second.
I'm older than you.

472
00:29:07,817 --> 00:29:11,154
A man acquires a reputation
on the street.

473
00:29:11,237 --> 00:29:13,948
What he does when he's up,
what he does at other times...

474
00:29:14,032 --> 00:29:17,243
I said, "10," you said, "No."
You said, "20," I said, "Fine."

475
00:29:17,285 --> 00:29:20,705
Now you want to throw
this 50-buck thing in.

476
00:29:20,788 --> 00:29:25,626
John, a good deal - has got to be
one where both parties -

477
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,921
Okay, okay, okay, fine -
20%%, 50 bucks a lead. It's done.

478
00:29:29,005 --> 00:29:30,923
Let's go out.
We make some money.

479
00:29:30,965 --> 00:29:33,593
I got bills to pay.
I want two sits tonight

480
00:29:33,676 --> 00:29:36,346
and I want the good leads -
the Glengarry leads - two.

481
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:38,598
Two, John, because
I am going to close 'em both.

482
00:29:38,681 --> 00:29:41,476
It's a long road
with no turning, pally.

483
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:44,437
Huh? Okay.
Now, let's go.

484
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:47,106
I've got to go back
to the office to get 'em.

485
00:29:47,148 --> 00:29:51,069
Go on, let's go.
This is what I was saying, John.

486
00:29:51,152 --> 00:29:53,821
All you need, a little boost,
you turn a streak around.

487
00:29:53,905 --> 00:29:56,949
Am I right? Good, huh?
Huh, good?

488
00:29:56,991 --> 00:29:59,452
What?

489
00:29:59,494 --> 00:30:02,288
- What?
- Two leads, 100 bucks.

490
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,457
- Now?
- Now, yes. When?

491
00:30:04,499 --> 00:30:06,793
- Shit, John.
- I wish I could.

492
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:09,545
You fucking asshole.

493
00:30:09,629 --> 00:30:12,882
I don't have it -
I don't -

494
00:30:12,965 --> 00:30:15,301
I'll bring it in the office
in the morning.

495
00:30:15,343 --> 00:30:17,762
- I'll be coming with the sales.
- Nope.

496
00:30:20,181 --> 00:30:22,892
I can't fucking
believe this.

497
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:26,312
All right, here's...

498
00:30:26,354 --> 00:30:28,189
20... 30, and -

499
00:30:28,272 --> 00:30:31,818
Jesus, here's the 30.
I'll bring the rest in tomorrow.

500
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:34,112
We got to do this, huh, pal?
For Christ's sake!

501
00:30:34,195 --> 00:30:35,989
No.

502
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,995
- My daughter...
- I can't do it, Shelly.

503
00:30:42,078 --> 00:30:45,164
I got to tell you something.
It wasn't so long ago,

504
00:30:45,206 --> 00:30:49,127
I'd pick up the phone
and call Murray - I got your job.

505
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:52,588
"Murray, the kid is burning my ass."
"Shelly, he's gone."

506
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:57,468
You are gone before
I'm back from lunch.

507
00:30:57,552 --> 00:30:59,262
Bought him a trip
to Bermuda once.

508
00:30:59,345 --> 00:31:01,180
- I've got to go.
- All right, hey.

509
00:31:01,222 --> 00:31:05,768
Give me - I'll take two more
of the old leads.

510
00:31:05,852 --> 00:31:08,438
- I gave you two today.
- One is a bust-out, John!

511
00:31:08,521 --> 00:31:10,481
- The other ain't home!
- Shelly -

512
00:31:10,565 --> 00:31:11,691
I promise you,
I've been on the phone - I know.

513
00:31:11,733 --> 00:31:13,443
No more leads today -
two per day. You've got yours.

514
00:31:13,526 --> 00:31:15,528
All right.

515
00:31:15,611 --> 00:31:18,031
- All right?
- Sure.

516
00:31:23,244 --> 00:31:27,707
We will do that...
other thing.

517
00:31:29,417 --> 00:31:32,587
I guess I left
my wallet in my room.

518
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,763
Deadbeats.
Deadbeats, all of 'em.

519
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:45,558
My mistake.
I shouldn't have took the leads.

520
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,894
- You had to.
- Yeah? Why?

521
00:31:47,977 --> 00:31:50,229
- To get on the -
- To get on the board, yeah.

522
00:31:50,271 --> 00:31:52,398
How am I gonna get on the board
trying to sell a doctor?

523
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,233
Two regular,
two chocolate donuts.

524
00:31:54,275 --> 00:31:57,362
Give me the same thing to go.
And don't try and sell an Indian.

525
00:31:57,445 --> 00:31:59,113
I will never try to sell
an Indian.

526
00:31:59,197 --> 00:32:01,449
These names come up -
you ever get 'em - "Patel"?

527
00:32:01,532 --> 00:32:04,494
- You ever get 'em?
- I think I had one once.

528
00:32:04,577 --> 00:32:06,871
You had one,
you'd know it - "Patel."

529
00:32:06,954 --> 00:32:08,581
They keep coming up.
I don't know.

530
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:11,000
They like to talk to salesmen.
They're lonely.

531
00:32:11,084 --> 00:32:13,795
They like to feel superior -
never bought a fucking thing.

532
00:32:13,878 --> 00:32:16,464
I don't know.
Come down the line -

533
00:32:16,547 --> 00:32:21,010
doctors, lawyers, Indians -
times are tight. It's tight.

534
00:32:21,094 --> 00:32:25,598
Pressure's just too great.
Man can't work all of 'em.

535
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,394
You go in the door - I got to close
this fucker or I don't eat lunch,

536
00:32:29,477 --> 00:32:33,189
or I don't win a Cadillac.
We work too hard, George.

537
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:40,655
Remember when we were - when we
were selling Glen Ross Farms?

538
00:32:40,738 --> 00:32:42,991
Didn't we sell
a bunch of that?

539
00:32:43,074 --> 00:32:45,243
- They came in -
- They fucked it up.

540
00:32:45,326 --> 00:32:47,286
- They did.
- They killed the goose. And now...

541
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,664
- We're stuck with this -
- Stuck with this fucking shit.

542
00:32:49,747 --> 00:32:51,374
- This shit.
- It's too...

543
00:32:51,457 --> 00:32:53,710
- It is.
- You get a bad month -

544
00:32:53,793 --> 00:32:57,213
they put you on this board.
Some contest board.

545
00:32:57,296 --> 00:32:59,757
- It's not right.
- It's not right to the customers.

546
00:32:59,841 --> 00:33:02,135
I know, it's - hey. What did I learn
as a kid on Western?

547
00:33:03,845 --> 00:33:08,182
Don't sell a guy one car.
Sell him five cars over 15 years.

548
00:33:08,266 --> 00:33:09,976
- That's right.
- You're goddamn right, it's right.

549
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:13,021
Guys come in - "Oh, the blah,
blah, blah. I know what I'll do.

550
00:33:13,104 --> 00:33:15,523
I'll go out and rob everybody
blind and go to Argentina

551
00:33:15,565 --> 00:33:17,442
'cause nobody ever
thought of this before."

552
00:33:17,525 --> 00:33:20,361
So they kill the goose
and the man's worked all his life -

553
00:33:20,445 --> 00:33:22,363
- That's right.
- He's got to cower in his boots -

554
00:33:22,363 --> 00:33:23,489
Boots, yes...

555
00:33:23,573 --> 00:33:26,909
For some fucking "Sell 10,000,
win the steak knives."

556
00:33:26,993 --> 00:33:28,870
- What do you do?
- What can you do?

557
00:33:28,953 --> 00:33:31,372
What can you do
if you don't have the leads?

558
00:33:31,414 --> 00:33:34,167
If you do not
have the goddamn leads!

559
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:37,253
Mr. Spannel?
Sheldon Levene.

560
00:33:37,337 --> 00:33:39,339
I was speaking
to your wife earlier?

561
00:33:39,422 --> 00:33:41,299
Come in.

562
00:33:42,592 --> 00:33:44,761
- "Cats and dogs," huh?
- Yeah.

563
00:33:44,844 --> 00:33:47,472
Oh, "cats and dogs."

564
00:33:49,766 --> 00:33:52,560
Oh, I see you're
interested in fishing.

565
00:33:52,644 --> 00:33:55,355
- Yeah.
- I've fished myself - many years.

566
00:33:55,396 --> 00:33:58,232
Muskee, Wisconsin.
Ooh, a beauty.

567
00:34:00,568 --> 00:34:02,987
- Where's the missus?
- Out at the PTA.

568
00:34:03,071 --> 00:34:04,906
- Ahh.
- What was this in reference...?

569
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:07,033
I spoke to your wife
earlier on the phone.

570
00:34:07,116 --> 00:34:09,035
I called, I'm in town
with Rio Rancho.

571
00:34:09,077 --> 00:34:12,288
Yes, I'm sorry. She said you had
some sort of award?

572
00:34:12,372 --> 00:34:15,625
Yes, I was speaking to the people
in my sales organization -

573
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:19,462
my representatives in this area -
and Mr. Spannel -

574
00:34:19,545 --> 00:34:22,382
your name is Larry.
Mind if I call you Larry?

575
00:34:22,423 --> 00:34:26,135
All right, Larry.
We had a consultant,

576
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:29,347
and he made me -
he made me an offer.

577
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:32,976
He offered me $230,000
to promote a sales plan -

578
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:37,563
to present investment opportunities
in Rio Rancho to the public.

579
00:34:37,647 --> 00:34:40,900
Well, I said, "Hell,
let me save you the 230,

580
00:34:40,984 --> 00:34:44,070
and pass the savings
along to the investor."

581
00:34:44,153 --> 00:34:47,323
My people immediately said,
"Whoa, how do you do that?

582
00:34:47,407 --> 00:34:50,368
How can you present
investment opportunities

583
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:52,620
without television,
without magazine ads?"

584
00:34:52,704 --> 00:34:54,622
I said, "You take
something this good,

585
00:34:54,664 --> 00:34:56,916
you go to a man -
has invested in the past -

586
00:34:56,958 --> 00:35:00,837
you go to him direct and offer
the money to him - rebate.

587
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,048
And don't give it
to this expert."

588
00:35:05,466 --> 00:35:07,510
So you're here
to sell me some land?

589
00:35:07,593 --> 00:35:09,762
No, I wouldn't try
to sell you -

590
00:35:09,846 --> 00:35:13,182
I leave that to the salesmen
and people who want to own land.

591
00:35:13,266 --> 00:35:16,019
I think something
has to be fed,

592
00:35:16,102 --> 00:35:19,022
watered and painted,
but don't invest in it.

593
00:35:19,105 --> 00:35:21,607
That motto has stood me
in good stead.

594
00:35:21,691 --> 00:35:23,901
- Mister -
- Just call me Shelly.

595
00:35:23,985 --> 00:35:26,195
I have never
been afraid of familiarity.

596
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:28,281
I'm walking out the door.
I've got to pick up my wife at the -

597
00:35:28,364 --> 00:35:30,783
Let's take my car.
We'll pick her up together.

598
00:35:30,825 --> 00:35:33,077
Spoke to the little woman
on the phone - can't wait to meet her.

599
00:35:33,161 --> 00:35:34,954
No, we're going
over to our relatives'.

600
00:35:34,996 --> 00:35:37,665
- She didn't say anything about that.
- I'm sure she forgot.

601
00:35:37,749 --> 00:35:40,376
- I'm on a plane to Florida -
- I'm sorry if we put you out.

602
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,962
You didn't put me out.
I'm just trying to think, Larry.

603
00:35:43,046 --> 00:35:45,631
You know, that's the only parcel
that I've got.

604
00:35:45,673 --> 00:35:48,426
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go back to the computer,

605
00:35:48,509 --> 00:35:51,637
I'm gonna pull another one, and we're
gonna speak to your relatives, too.

606
00:35:51,721 --> 00:35:54,098
- No, no, no.
- C'mon, you're a busy man, so am I.

607
00:35:54,182 --> 00:35:57,018
My God, I'm in the act
of giving a gift away.

608
00:35:57,101 --> 00:36:00,021
Look, I don't want to buy land.
I don't want to invest in land.

609
00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:04,651
I have nothing. She took the call
without my knowledge.

610
00:36:04,734 --> 00:36:06,986
I have no business
that I wish to transact.

611
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,905
I don't want to tell you
how to handle your wife.

612
00:36:08,988 --> 00:36:12,825
My wife filled in a form, and we
have been plagued for the last year -

613
00:36:12,867 --> 00:36:15,870
That's the situation
I'm trying to alleviate, Larry.

614
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:17,705
No, no.
Do you understand?

615
00:36:18,915 --> 00:36:20,792
Thank you. No.

616
00:36:36,557 --> 00:36:38,768
- Roma, man - he don't care.
- He don't care.

617
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:42,271
He's sitting on top of the world.
He's got good leads, good prospects.

618
00:36:42,355 --> 00:36:44,732
- Sales, sales.
- Sales contests.

619
00:36:44,816 --> 00:36:47,610
- That's what I'm saying.
- Times turn hard, they bounce you out.

620
00:36:47,694 --> 00:36:49,696
If they bounce you with no
confidence -

621
00:36:49,779 --> 00:36:52,365
That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying to you.

622
00:36:57,745 --> 00:37:00,206
If they get you
on a bad beat -

623
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:02,750
and you got to go out there,
get a new job -

624
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:04,585
- With no -
- With no confidence -

625
00:37:04,627 --> 00:37:06,212
Yes.

626
00:37:06,254 --> 00:37:10,508
I'll tell you what the hard part is -
to stop thinking like a goddamn slave.

627
00:37:10,591 --> 00:37:14,053
You say the Nazis
in Europe -
"If they came in my door" -

628
00:37:14,137 --> 00:37:16,514
bullshit, the time is now.
What do you do now?

629
00:37:16,597 --> 00:37:18,891
Some guy pissing in your face.
Cocksucker -

630
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:21,436
wants to break your rice bowl.

631
00:37:21,477 --> 00:37:25,064
Mitch and Murray, fuck you.
What I say - fuck you!

632
00:37:25,148 --> 00:37:27,942
Sitting on the good leads.

633
00:37:28,026 --> 00:37:30,862
George, we're men here.

634
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,448
Yes.

635
00:37:33,531 --> 00:37:37,452
And I'll tell you -
I'll tell you what the hard part is.

636
00:37:37,535 --> 00:37:40,121
- What?
- Starting up.

637
00:37:40,204 --> 00:37:42,915
Standing up.
Breaking free of this bullshit,

638
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:46,711
this enslavement to some guy,
'cause he's got the upper hand.

639
00:37:49,464 --> 00:37:52,425
This is the difference -
listen to me, George.

640
00:37:52,467 --> 00:37:54,635
Now Jerry Graff went
into business for himself.

641
00:37:54,719 --> 00:38:00,308
He said, "I'm going on my own."
And he was free, you understand me?

642
00:38:01,517 --> 00:38:04,520
I'll tell you - I'll tell you
what somebody should do.

643
00:38:07,565 --> 00:38:08,566
What?

644
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:11,277
Somebody should stand up
and strike back.

645
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:13,655
Somebody should do something
to them.

646
00:38:13,738 --> 00:38:15,948
- What?
- Something to pay them back.

647
00:38:16,032 --> 00:38:17,867
Someone should hurt them,
Mitch and Murray.

648
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,619
- Somebody should hurt them?
- Yeah.

649
00:38:19,702 --> 00:38:21,579
- How?
- Someone should do something

650
00:38:21,663 --> 00:38:23,373
- to hurt them where they live.
- What?

651
00:38:23,456 --> 00:38:26,626
Someone should rob the office.
That's what I'm saying.

652
00:38:26,709 --> 00:38:30,171
If we were that kind of guy
to hold up the joint and trash it,

653
00:38:30,213 --> 00:38:33,299
it looks like robbery,
we take the leads out of the files

654
00:38:33,341 --> 00:38:35,301
and we go to Jerry Graff.

655
00:38:35,343 --> 00:38:39,222
And we take the fucking
Glengarry leads! Huh?

656
00:38:42,058 --> 00:38:45,311
Yeah, Mr. Nyborg? Ah, Mr. Nyborg,
Sheldon Levene.

657
00:38:45,395 --> 00:38:47,981
I was speaking to your wife earlier.
That's right.

658
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:51,693
I'd like to speak to you
about awarding you your prize.

659
00:38:51,776 --> 00:38:53,778
We're coming to the end
of our fiscal year,

660
00:38:53,861 --> 00:38:56,531
I'd really like to get it
off the books before -

661
00:38:56,614 --> 00:38:59,617
yes, the prize
for Consolidated Properties.

662
00:38:59,701 --> 00:39:02,203
The information you requested
on Rio Rancho.

663
00:39:02,286 --> 00:39:05,498
Now, I'm in town only for -
well, let me see.

664
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,543
I suppose I could
swing by tonight. Yes. Uh-huh.

665
00:39:08,584 --> 00:39:11,170
When do you think
it might be more convenient?

666
00:39:11,212 --> 00:39:13,840
As I said,
I could swing by tonight -

667
00:39:13,881 --> 00:39:16,384
well, of course,
you speak to your wife.

668
00:39:16,467 --> 00:39:18,386
Grace, I'm gonna need

669
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:21,014
a first-class seat,
passport, 10,000 in cash,

670
00:39:21,097 --> 00:39:23,349
put that with the negotiable
papers, if you would.

671
00:39:23,433 --> 00:39:27,645
And put me
on the telex hookup - yes?

672
00:39:27,729 --> 00:39:31,190
Well, when do you think
Mrs. Nyborg might be back?

673
00:39:31,733 --> 00:39:34,694
All train compartments
smell vaguely of shit.

674
00:39:34,777 --> 00:39:37,989
It gets so you don't
mind it.

675
00:39:38,072 --> 00:39:41,200
That's the worst thing
that I can confess.

676
00:39:41,284 --> 00:39:43,870
You know how long it took me
to get there? A long time.

677
00:39:45,621 --> 00:39:50,084
When you die you're gonna regret
the things you don't do.

678
00:39:50,126 --> 00:39:53,212
You think you're queer?
I'm gonna tell you something.

679
00:39:53,296 --> 00:39:56,758
We're all queer.
You think you're a thief? So what?

680
00:39:56,799 --> 00:39:59,385
You get befuddled
by a middle-class morality?

681
00:39:59,469 --> 00:40:01,429
Get shut of it.
Shut it out.

682
00:40:01,471 --> 00:40:05,558
You cheat on your wife,
you did it. Live with it.

683
00:40:05,642 --> 00:40:08,895
You fuck little girls,
so be it.

684
00:40:08,978 --> 00:40:12,732
There's an absolute morality?
Maybe.

685
00:40:12,815 --> 00:40:15,443
And then what?

686
00:40:15,526 --> 00:40:19,072
If you think there is,
go ahead, be that thing.

687
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,075
Bad people go to hell?
I don't think so.

688
00:40:22,158 --> 00:40:24,118
You think that,
act that way.

689
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:30,583
A hell exists on earth?
Yes. I won't live in it.

690
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:32,627
That's me.

691
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:41,219
Did you ever take a dump, made you
feel like you slept for 12 hours?

692
00:40:41,302 --> 00:40:43,930
- Did I...?
- Yes.

693
00:40:44,013 --> 00:40:47,517
- I don't know.
- Or a piss?

694
00:40:51,896 --> 00:40:54,857
Great meals fade
in reflection.

695
00:40:54,941 --> 00:40:57,610
Everything else gains.
Do you know why?

696
00:40:57,694 --> 00:41:01,072
'Cause it's only food.
This shit we put in us,

697
00:41:01,155 --> 00:41:03,574
keeps us going -
it's only food.

698
00:41:04,826 --> 00:41:07,120
The great fucks
you may have had,

699
00:41:07,203 --> 00:41:09,163
what do you remember
about them?

700
00:41:09,205 --> 00:41:13,292
- What do I remember?
- Yeah.

701
00:41:15,086 --> 00:41:16,796
I don't know.
For me,

702
00:41:16,879 --> 00:41:20,341
I'm saying what it is,
it's probably not the orgasm.

703
00:41:22,051 --> 00:41:25,805
Some broad's forearm
on your neck,

704
00:41:25,888 --> 00:41:30,351
something her eyes did.
There was this sound she made.

705
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:34,314
Or it's me in the -
I'm telling you -

706
00:41:34,397 --> 00:41:38,359
I'm in bed the next day,
she brought me café au lait,

707
00:41:38,401 --> 00:41:41,863
gives me a cigarette,
my balls feel like concrete.

708
00:41:41,904 --> 00:41:43,448
Eh?

709
00:41:45,533 --> 00:41:47,869
What I'm saying,
what is our life?

710
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:53,291
Our life is looking forward
or it's looking back.

711
00:41:53,374 --> 00:41:57,170
That's it.
That's our life.

712
00:41:57,253 --> 00:41:59,839
Where's the moment?

713
00:42:04,385 --> 00:42:07,347
And what is it
we're so afraid of?

714
00:42:07,388 --> 00:42:09,307
Loss. What else?

715
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:14,520
The bank closes, we get sick,
my wife died on a plane?

716
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,192
The stock market collapsed?
What of these things happen?

717
00:42:19,233 --> 00:42:22,362
None of them.
We worry anyway. Why?

718
00:42:24,739 --> 00:42:25,698
What could we get
for them?

719
00:42:25,782 --> 00:42:28,534
- For them?
- For the leads.

720
00:42:28,576 --> 00:42:30,620
What could we get
for the leads?

721
00:42:30,703 --> 00:42:35,083
I don't know. 10 bucks a throw.
15 maybe. I don't know.

722
00:42:36,626 --> 00:42:39,295
For the leads, you're saying?
Say somebody took them,

723
00:42:39,379 --> 00:42:42,507
- went to Jerry Graff?
- Yeah. How many leads do we have?

724
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:43,883
The Glengarry?
The premium leads?

725
00:42:43,966 --> 00:42:47,178
I've got to think they've got 500.
Say 500 leads.

726
00:42:47,261 --> 00:42:50,515
You're saying a fella could take
those leads and sell them to Graff?

727
00:42:50,598 --> 00:42:52,850
The leads to Graff.
Yes. I was saying - yeah.

728
00:42:52,934 --> 00:42:55,520
A guy could take -
like anything else, it seems to me,

729
00:42:55,603 --> 00:42:58,106
that is negotiable,
a guy could sell them.

730
00:42:58,189 --> 00:43:01,567
- How do you know he'd buy them?
- Because I worked for him.

731
00:43:01,651 --> 00:43:05,363
- You didn't talk to him?
- No. What do you mean?

732
00:43:05,446 --> 00:43:07,532
- Did I talk to him about this?
- Yeah.

733
00:43:07,615 --> 00:43:09,909
Are you just talking about this,
or are we just talking about it?

734
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,412
- Just speaking about it.
- Speaking about it as an idea?

735
00:43:12,453 --> 00:43:14,580
- Yes.
- We're not actually talking about it.

736
00:43:14,622 --> 00:43:17,417
- No.
- Talking about it as a robbery.

737
00:43:17,458 --> 00:43:20,253
As a robbery? No.

738
00:43:22,672 --> 00:43:24,924
- Well...
- Hey.

739
00:43:24,966 --> 00:43:27,760
So all this -
you didn't actually call Graff?

740
00:43:27,844 --> 00:43:30,305
- You didn't talk to him?
- Not actually, no.

741
00:43:30,346 --> 00:43:32,598
- You didn't?
- No, not actually.

742
00:43:32,682 --> 00:43:34,267
- Did you?
- What did I say?

743
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,144
- What did you say?
- I said, "Not actually."

744
00:43:36,227 --> 00:43:38,396
Fuck you care, George?
We're just talking.

745
00:43:38,479 --> 00:43:39,772
- We are?
- Yes.

746
00:43:39,814 --> 00:43:43,234
- Because it's a crime.
- Robbery. That's right.

747
00:43:45,069 --> 00:43:46,946
It is a crime.

748
00:43:49,532 --> 00:43:52,452
- It's also very safe.
- You're actually talking about this.

749
00:43:52,493 --> 00:43:55,288
- That's right.
- You're going to steal the leads.

750
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:56,789
- Have I said that?
- Are you?

751
00:43:56,831 --> 00:43:58,624
- Did I say that?
- Did you talk to Graff?

752
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:00,293
- What did I say?
- What did he say?

753
00:44:00,376 --> 00:44:02,170
What did he say?

754
00:44:05,381 --> 00:44:07,467
He'd buy them.

755
00:44:16,351 --> 00:44:18,478
You're gonna steal -

756
00:44:18,561 --> 00:44:21,731
you're gonna steal the Glengarry
leads and sell them to Graff?

757
00:44:21,814 --> 00:44:24,817
- Yes.
- What's he gonna pay?

758
00:44:24,901 --> 00:44:28,154
He figures there's 500 leads,
let's say 10 bucks apiece,

759
00:44:28,237 --> 00:44:31,824
- that's $2,500 each.
- Each?

760
00:44:31,908 --> 00:44:33,868
- "Each"?
- That's right, George.

761
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:36,371
- You're saying me?
- No, you and me.

762
00:44:36,412 --> 00:44:40,667
Yeah. That's exactly
what I'm saying. $2,500 apiece.

763
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,044
You and me for one night's work,
and a job with Graff

764
00:44:43,127 --> 00:44:45,880
- working the premium leads.
- A job with Graff?

765
00:44:45,963 --> 00:44:48,341
- Is that what I said?
- He'd give me a job?

766
00:44:48,424 --> 00:44:50,510
He could take you on.
Yes.

767
00:45:13,241 --> 00:45:14,701
Hello?

768
00:45:14,784 --> 00:45:17,203
I was dialing the direct line
to my daughter's room.

769
00:45:17,245 --> 00:45:19,998
Sheldon Levene.
She's in -

770
00:45:20,081 --> 00:45:24,627
well, yeah, I'm sure she's asleep.
But - where's the duty nurse?

771
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,215
They canceled her -
well, let me talk -

772
00:45:29,298 --> 00:45:31,300
who am I speaking to?

773
00:45:34,095 --> 00:45:37,348
I'll have the money there
tomorrow.

774
00:45:37,932 --> 00:45:39,892
It's a big decision,
George.

775
00:45:39,976 --> 00:45:43,354
At times a guy
has got to make one.

776
00:45:43,438 --> 00:45:45,523
It's a big decision
and it's a big reward.

777
00:45:45,606 --> 00:45:48,901
$2,500 and a job, it's a big reward
for one night's work.

778
00:45:48,985 --> 00:45:51,070
Yes.

779
00:45:51,154 --> 00:45:53,614
Sometimes a guy...

780
00:45:53,698 --> 00:45:56,075
sometimes, a man
if he wants a reward -

781
00:45:56,117 --> 00:45:58,703
That's absolutely right.

782
00:45:58,786 --> 00:46:00,747
He'll do one thing,
one thing on one night.

783
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:05,418
That's absolutely right.
The thing is, it's got to be tonight.

784
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:06,544
What?

785
00:46:06,627 --> 00:46:08,588
What, what?
The leads ain't going to leave?

786
00:46:08,671 --> 00:46:10,882
They bring those leads up,
wave them under your nose,

787
00:46:10,965 --> 00:46:13,092
tomorrow they take them downtown,
parcel them out.

788
00:46:13,176 --> 00:46:15,928
A guy wants those leads,
he's gonna have to get them tonight.

789
00:46:16,012 --> 00:46:18,973
Tonight is the thing.
Talk about a chance.

790
00:46:19,015 --> 00:46:20,767
It's when a chance
presents itself.

791
00:46:20,808 --> 00:46:22,435
You got to go
in there tonight.

792
00:46:22,518 --> 00:46:23,895
- You.
- I'm sorry?

793
00:46:23,978 --> 00:46:25,647
- You.
- Me?

794
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:27,774
You have to go in.
You have to get the leads.

795
00:46:27,857 --> 00:46:30,318
- I do?
- It's not something for nothing.

796
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,113
I took you in on this.
You have to go. It's your thing.

797
00:46:34,197 --> 00:46:36,366
I've made a deal with Graff.
I can't go in.

798
00:46:36,449 --> 00:46:39,702
I've spoken out on this too much.
I've got a big mouth.

799
00:46:39,786 --> 00:46:42,789
"The fucking leads," et cetera,
"the tight-ass company," blah, blah.

800
00:46:42,872 --> 00:46:45,833
- They'll know when you go to Graff.
- What will they know?

801
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:48,127
That I stole the leads?
I didn't steal the leads.

802
00:46:48,211 --> 00:46:50,963
I'm gonna go to the movies.
Then I'm gonna have a late drink

803
00:46:51,047 --> 00:46:53,216
- at the Como Inn with a friend.
- Dave.

804
00:46:53,299 --> 00:46:54,592
Yes?

805
00:46:54,676 --> 00:46:56,761
You want me to break into the office
tonight and steal the leads?

806
00:46:56,844 --> 00:46:58,096
- Yes.
- No.

807
00:46:58,179 --> 00:46:59,764
- Oh, yes, George.
- What does that mean?

808
00:46:59,847 --> 00:47:04,268
Listen to this. I have an alibi.
I'm going to the Como Inn.

809
00:47:04,352 --> 00:47:07,105
Why? Why?
The place gets robbed,

810
00:47:07,188 --> 00:47:09,649
they're going to come looking for me.
Why? Because I probably did it.

811
00:47:09,691 --> 00:47:12,151
Let me ask you this -
are you going to turn me in?

812
00:47:12,193 --> 00:47:14,028
What if you don't get caught?

813
00:47:14,112 --> 00:47:15,613
They come to you,
are you going to turn me in?

814
00:47:15,655 --> 00:47:17,699
- Why would they come to me?
- They're going to come to everybody.

815
00:47:17,782 --> 00:47:19,534
- Why would I do it?
- You wouldn't, George.

816
00:47:19,617 --> 00:47:21,619
That's why I'm talking to you now.
They come to you,

817
00:47:21,703 --> 00:47:23,496
- are you going to turn me in?
- No.

818
00:47:23,538 --> 00:47:25,206
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

819
00:47:25,248 --> 00:47:30,294
Uh-huh. George...
when they come to me,

820
00:47:30,378 --> 00:47:33,006
if I have to go in there,
and if I get caught -

821
00:47:33,089 --> 00:47:35,925
- they come to me...
- You don't have to go in.

822
00:47:36,009 --> 00:47:37,844
I have to go in, see?
That's something I have to do.

823
00:47:37,927 --> 00:47:40,013
- Why?
- Why?

824
00:47:40,054 --> 00:47:41,681
Are you going to give me $7,500?

825
00:47:41,723 --> 00:47:43,975
75? I thought we were
splitting five grand.

826
00:47:44,058 --> 00:47:47,020
I lied, all right? Your end is 25,
my end is my own concern.

827
00:47:47,103 --> 00:47:50,064
Now, stick with me here.
If they come to me,

828
00:47:50,148 --> 00:47:52,817
I'm caught, they're going to ask me
who were accomplices.

829
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,527
- Me.
- Absolutely.

830
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:55,903
That's ridiculous.

831
00:47:55,945 --> 00:47:57,822
To the law, you're
an accessory before the fact.

832
00:47:57,864 --> 00:48:00,783
- I didn't ask to be.
- Tough luck, because you are.

833
00:48:00,867 --> 00:48:03,494
- Because you told me about it?
- That's right.

834
00:48:03,578 --> 00:48:06,080
Why are you doing this
to me, Dave?

835
00:48:06,164 --> 00:48:08,791
Why are you talking this way to me?
I don't understand.

836
00:48:08,875 --> 00:48:12,086
- Why are you doing this at all?
- None of your fucking business.

837
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:14,047
Just in or out?
You tell me.

838
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:15,673
You're out,
you take the consequences.

839
00:48:15,757 --> 00:48:17,675
- I do?
- That's right.

840
00:48:17,759 --> 00:48:19,719
- And why is that?
- Because you listened.

841
00:48:20,094 --> 00:48:21,554
Well, when will
Mrs. Nyborg be back?

842
00:48:21,638 --> 00:48:24,223
You know, I hate to keep
calling you this late, Bruce,

843
00:48:24,307 --> 00:48:28,436
but I feel a responsibility,
I must say. When you have -

844
00:48:30,104 --> 00:48:33,566
You know, they say,
"You don't buy it, you rent it."

845
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:35,943
- Huh?
- The thing.

846
00:48:36,027 --> 00:48:40,948
You really...
what do you keep?

847
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:43,785
I mean, you don't keep
anything, really.

848
00:48:43,868 --> 00:48:46,621
- No.
- Security.

849
00:48:46,704 --> 00:48:49,290
Things. Things.

850
00:48:49,374 --> 00:48:51,751
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.

851
00:48:51,834 --> 00:48:56,422
It's just... you try
to stave off insecurity.

852
00:48:56,506 --> 00:48:57,924
You can't do it.

853
00:48:58,341 --> 00:49:00,426
- No.
- No. That's what I'm telling you.

854
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:05,765
Stocks, bonds, objects of art,
real estate, what are they?

855
00:49:05,848 --> 00:49:09,310
An opportunity.
To what? To make money?

856
00:49:09,352 --> 00:49:13,314
Perhaps. To lose money?
Perhaps.

857
00:49:13,356 --> 00:49:16,859
To indulge and to learn
about ourselves? Perhaps.

858
00:49:16,943 --> 00:49:20,029
So fucking what?
What is it? They're an opportunity.

859
00:49:20,113 --> 00:49:23,032
That's all they are.
They're an event.

860
00:49:23,116 --> 00:49:26,786
A guy comes to you,
you make a call. You send in a card,

861
00:49:26,828 --> 00:49:29,622
I have these properties
I would like for you to see.

862
00:49:29,664 --> 00:49:32,709
What does this mean?
What do you want it to mean?

863
00:49:32,792 --> 00:49:34,919
You see what I'm saying?

864
00:49:37,547 --> 00:49:39,966
Things happen to you.

865
00:49:41,217 --> 00:49:43,845
Glad I met you.

866
00:49:43,928 --> 00:49:45,638
I'm glad I met you,
James.

867
00:49:47,765 --> 00:49:50,393
I want to show you
something.

868
00:49:50,476 --> 00:49:52,979
It may mean something to you,
it may not.

869
00:49:53,062 --> 00:49:55,898
I don't know.
I don't know anymore.

870
00:49:58,693 --> 00:50:01,738
What is that?
Florida.

871
00:50:01,821 --> 00:50:04,657
Glengarry Highlands.
Florida.

872
00:50:04,699 --> 00:50:07,702
Bullshit.
And maybe that's true.

873
00:50:07,785 --> 00:50:10,913
And that's what I said.

874
00:50:10,997 --> 00:50:13,499
But look at this.

875
00:50:13,583 --> 00:50:18,046
What is this?
This is a piece of land.

876
00:50:18,087 --> 00:50:20,548
Listen to what I'm going
to tell you now.

877
00:50:48,618 --> 00:50:50,703
- What happened?
- Where do you work?

878
00:50:50,787 --> 00:50:53,373
I work, yes.
I work here.

879
00:50:53,456 --> 00:50:55,917
- What is it? What happened?
- Robbery.

880
00:51:02,298 --> 00:51:06,386
Williamson. Williamson,
did they get the contracts?

881
00:51:09,097 --> 00:51:11,474
All right, tell me.
Now. Tell me.

882
00:51:11,557 --> 00:51:13,393
- They stole the contracts?
- Excuse me, sir.

883
00:51:13,434 --> 00:51:14,852
- Did they get my contract?
- Excuse me, fella.

884
00:51:14,936 --> 00:51:16,145
- Did they?
- Would you excuse us?

885
00:51:16,229 --> 00:51:18,356
Don't fuck with me, fella.
I'm talking about a Cadillac car

886
00:51:18,439 --> 00:51:21,067
- that you owe me.
- They didn't get your contract.

887
00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:23,486
- I filed it before I left.
- They didn't get my contracts?

888
00:51:23,569 --> 00:51:25,488
They got - excuse me.

889
00:51:25,571 --> 00:51:27,573
Fuck.

890
00:51:27,657 --> 00:51:30,410
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Williamson!

891
00:51:30,493 --> 00:51:33,413
- Williamson, open the fucking door.
- Who are you?

892
00:51:33,454 --> 00:51:35,581
- They didn't get the contracts.
- Did they?

893
00:51:35,665 --> 00:51:38,209
They got - listen to me.
They got some of them.

894
00:51:38,292 --> 00:51:40,920
- Some of them?
- Who told you?

895
00:51:41,004 --> 00:51:44,340
Who told me?
Who told me we had a robbery?

896
00:51:44,424 --> 00:51:46,092
We got a fucking board
up on the window.

897
00:51:46,134 --> 00:51:50,596
Who is this? Yes.
Yes, I confess. I did it.

898
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,974
Now, leave me
a second here, please.

899
00:51:53,057 --> 00:51:55,727
- Okay, now, talk to me.
- I'm still trying to sort it out.

900
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:57,937
- So far -
- Talk to me. Talk to me.

901
00:51:58,021 --> 00:52:01,274
They got some
of the contracts?

902
00:52:01,357 --> 00:52:04,569
Lingk. James Lingk,
which I closed last night.

903
00:52:04,652 --> 00:52:06,279
- You closed it last night?
- Yes.

904
00:52:06,362 --> 00:52:10,033
- I filed it. It went down.
- You filed it?

905
00:52:10,116 --> 00:52:12,452
- James Lingk?
- Yes.

906
00:52:12,535 --> 00:52:14,495
- It was sent downtown?
- Yes, all right?

907
00:52:14,537 --> 00:52:16,497
I filed it last night.
It went to the bank.

908
00:52:16,539 --> 00:52:18,916
- It went downtown, all right?
- You filed it?

909
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,627
Then I'm over the fucking top,
you owe me a Cadillac.

910
00:52:21,711 --> 00:52:23,921
- I don't -
- I don't want to hear any shit.

911
00:52:24,005 --> 00:52:26,966
I don't give a shit.
Lingk puts me over the top.

912
00:52:27,008 --> 00:52:30,011
You filed it. It went downtown.
Now you owe me the car.

913
00:52:30,094 --> 00:52:33,056
- The robbery makes difficult -
- Fuck you! You owe me the car!

914
00:52:33,139 --> 00:52:35,767
See, 'cause this is how
we keep score, "bubby."

915
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:38,978
You told me, "Close thus,
and so you get the car."

916
00:52:39,062 --> 00:52:42,065
- I got it.
- Would you excuse us, please?

917
00:52:42,148 --> 00:52:45,068
You hear what I said?
Do you hear what I said?

918
00:52:45,151 --> 00:52:48,655
Hey, pal!
Your excuses are your own!

919
00:52:59,415 --> 00:53:01,959
"Recontact James Lingk.

920
00:53:02,043 --> 00:53:05,838
6:00 p.m. Morton Grove."
Ah-ha.

921
00:53:05,922 --> 00:53:08,424
When do you expect
her in?

922
00:53:08,508 --> 00:53:11,219
This is Ricky Roma
from last night.

923
00:53:11,302 --> 00:53:14,389
She'll remember.
Just, just - wait a minute!

924
00:53:14,472 --> 00:53:17,809
Just to say - to thank her
for a wonderful time.

925
00:53:17,892 --> 00:53:20,353
Thank you.
I'll call back later. Thank you.

926
00:53:20,395 --> 00:53:22,814
They should check
if we're insured.

927
00:53:25,149 --> 00:53:27,819
Uh-huh.

928
00:53:27,902 --> 00:53:30,822
"10:00 p.m., Octavia."

929
00:53:30,905 --> 00:53:33,908
Please don't leave.
I'm going to talk to you.

930
00:53:33,992 --> 00:53:36,869
- What's your name?
- Are you talking to me?

931
00:53:36,911 --> 00:53:39,914
- That's right.
- My name is Richard Roma.

932
00:53:51,759 --> 00:53:54,387
I - you know,
they should be insured.

933
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:56,931
- What do you care?
- Then they wouldn't be so upset.

934
00:53:57,015 --> 00:53:59,517
- Huh?
- They wouldn't be so upset.

935
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,228
- Mitch and Murray.
- Yeah, you're right.

936
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:04,105
That's right.
How are you?

937
00:54:04,188 --> 00:54:06,399
I'm fine.

938
00:54:06,482 --> 00:54:08,943
You mean the board?
You mean on the board?

939
00:54:10,737 --> 00:54:13,948
Yes. Okay.
The board.

940
00:54:14,032 --> 00:54:16,534
I'm fucked on the board.
I can't -

941
00:54:18,828 --> 00:54:21,414
My mind must be other places,
'cause I can't -

942
00:54:21,497 --> 00:54:23,916
What?
You can't do what?

943
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:26,753
- I can't close them.
- Well, they're old.

944
00:54:26,836 --> 00:54:30,506
Look, look at this shit
they're giving you. Huh?

945
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:32,800
- Yes, they are old.
- They're ancient.

946
00:54:32,884 --> 00:54:35,345
"Clear Meadows."
This shit's dead.

947
00:54:35,428 --> 00:54:36,763
- It is dead.
- Waste of time.

948
00:54:36,846 --> 00:54:41,309
- Yes. I'm no fucking good.
- Hey, fuck that shit, George.

949
00:54:41,392 --> 00:54:43,645
You had a bad month.
You're a good man.

950
00:54:43,728 --> 00:54:45,480
- I am?
- Yeah, you had a bad streak.

951
00:54:45,563 --> 00:54:49,317
Look at this. 15 units, Mountain View,
the fucking things get stolen.

952
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,029
- He said he filed -
- He filed the big one.

953
00:54:53,112 --> 00:54:55,281
He filed the guy from the bar
that I closed last night.

954
00:54:55,323 --> 00:54:57,825
All the little ones,
I got to go back.

955
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:02,830
Can you believe this?
I got to go back and close again.

956
00:55:02,914 --> 00:55:05,500
I mean, talk about
a fucking beat

957
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:09,170
that would sap anyone's - wait,
wait, wait. Where are the phones?

958
00:55:09,253 --> 00:55:12,090
- They stole -
- They stole...?

959
00:55:12,173 --> 00:55:14,676
- What kind of an outfit is it...
- They stole the phones.

960
00:55:14,759 --> 00:55:17,512
...when criminals come and they take -
they steal the phones?

961
00:55:17,595 --> 00:55:19,806
They stole the leads.
They stole the phones,

962
00:55:19,847 --> 00:55:22,475
they stole - aw, Christ.

963
00:55:22,558 --> 00:55:26,813
What am I going
to do this month? Shit.

964
00:55:26,854 --> 00:55:28,856
You think they're going to catch -
where are you going?

965
00:55:28,898 --> 00:55:31,067
Down the street.

966
00:55:32,527 --> 00:55:37,073
- Where are you going?
- To the - what do you fucking care?

967
00:55:37,156 --> 00:55:41,577
- Aren't you going out today?
- With what, John? With what?

968
00:55:41,661 --> 00:55:44,831
Well, answer me.
They stole the Glengarry leads.

969
00:55:44,914 --> 00:55:48,376
- They stole Rio Rancho.
- I have stuff from last year's file.

970
00:55:48,459 --> 00:55:51,671
Oh, oh, oh.
Your "nostalgia" file.

971
00:55:51,754 --> 00:55:54,507
Oh, great. That's great,
'cause I don't...

972
00:55:54,549 --> 00:55:56,801
- Do you want to go out today?
- I don't have to eat this month.

973
00:55:56,884 --> 00:55:59,470
Great.
Give them to me.

974
00:55:59,554 --> 00:56:02,974
Bring them.
Come on.

975
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:08,021
Fucking Mitch and Murray
are going to shit a -

976
00:56:08,062 --> 00:56:11,232
What am I going
to do all month?

977
00:56:11,316 --> 00:56:13,609
See, the thing
of it is,

978
00:56:13,693 --> 00:56:16,154
is were the leads insured?
You think?

979
00:56:16,237 --> 00:56:19,157
- What?
- Were the leads insured?

980
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,576
I don't know, why?

981
00:56:21,659 --> 00:56:23,536
'Cause if they weren't,
I know Mitch and Murray...

982
00:56:23,619 --> 00:56:25,997
- What?
- They'll be upset.

983
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,541
That's right.

984
00:56:28,624 --> 00:56:30,835
You're right.

985
00:56:32,086 --> 00:56:34,589
He said we're all going
to have to talk to the guy.

986
00:56:34,672 --> 00:56:36,215
- To...
- The cop.

987
00:56:36,299 --> 00:56:38,343
Great. We have to talk
to the cop.

988
00:56:38,426 --> 00:56:42,096
- Another waste of time.
- A waste of time? Why?

989
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,098
Why? 'Cause they're not going
to find the guy.

990
00:56:44,182 --> 00:56:48,061
- The cops?
- Yes, the cops. No.

991
00:56:48,102 --> 00:56:49,771
The cops aren't going
to find the guy?

992
00:56:49,854 --> 00:56:51,606
- Nope.
- Why do you think so?

993
00:56:51,689 --> 00:56:53,191
Why? Because they are stupid.
Where were you last night?

994
00:56:55,443 --> 00:56:57,779
- Where were you?
- Where was I?

995
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:58,905
- Yeah.
- I was at home.

996
00:56:58,946 --> 00:57:00,073
- Where were you?
- At home.

997
00:57:00,114 --> 00:57:01,991
See? Were you the guy
who broke in?

998
00:57:02,075 --> 00:57:03,117
- Was I?
- Yes.

999
00:57:03,201 --> 00:57:05,411
- No.
- Then don't sweat it. You know why?

1000
00:57:05,453 --> 00:57:07,580
- No.
- You have nothing to hide.

1001
00:57:07,664 --> 00:57:10,375
- When I talk to police, I get nervous.
- Yes, you know who doesn't?

1002
00:57:10,458 --> 00:57:13,002
- No. Who?
- Thieves.

1003
00:57:13,086 --> 00:57:15,046
I don't know
what I'm going to tell them.

1004
00:57:15,088 --> 00:57:17,423
The truth.
Always tell them the truth.

1005
00:57:17,465 --> 00:57:19,509
It's the easiest thing
to remember.

1006
00:57:20,093 --> 00:57:23,096
Whoa, whoa!
"Patel"?

1007
00:57:23,179 --> 00:57:25,640
"Ravidam Patel"?

1008
00:57:25,723 --> 00:57:27,517
How am I going to make a living
on these deadbeats?

1009
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,560
- Where did you get this from, a morgue?
- Look, I'm -

1010
00:57:29,644 --> 00:57:32,772
Come on. What's the point?
What's the fucking point?

1011
00:57:32,855 --> 00:57:35,733
I got to argue with you,
I got to knock heads with the cops,

1012
00:57:35,817 --> 00:57:37,610
I'm busting my balls
to sell your dirt

1013
00:57:37,694 --> 00:57:40,488
to deadbeats -
money in the mattress.

1014
00:57:40,571 --> 00:57:43,074
I come back, you can't even
keep the contracts safe.

1015
00:57:43,157 --> 00:57:45,326
I got to go out -
fuck this shit.

1016
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:47,203
I'm going to go out
and re-close last week's stuff.

1017
00:57:47,286 --> 00:57:49,330
No, the word from Murray
is leave them alone.

1018
00:57:49,414 --> 00:57:51,624
If he needs a new sig,
he'll go out himself.

1019
00:57:51,666 --> 00:57:54,669
- Murray's gonna go out?
- He'll be "president of the company

1020
00:57:54,711 --> 00:57:57,046
just in from out of town,"
all right?

1021
00:57:58,589 --> 00:58:01,592
Okay, okay, okay.
Give me this shit.

1022
00:58:01,676 --> 00:58:04,137
- I'm giving you three leads.
- Three? I count two.

1023
00:58:04,178 --> 00:58:06,431
- There's three leads there.
- Patel? Fuck you.

1024
00:58:06,514 --> 00:58:09,517
Fucking Shiva handed
this guy a million dollars,

1025
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,811
told him, "Sign the deal,"
he wouldn't sign.

1026
00:58:11,894 --> 00:58:14,647
And the god Vishnu, too,
into the bargain. Fuck you.

1027
00:58:14,731 --> 00:58:17,567
You know your business, I know mine.
Your business is being an asshole.

1028
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:20,236
If I find out whose fucking cousin
you are, I'm gonna go to him

1029
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:24,532
and figure out a way
to have your ass - fuck you!

1030
00:58:24,615 --> 00:58:27,243
I'm waiting
for the new leads.

1031
00:58:31,706 --> 00:58:34,834
Get the chalk!
Hey! Get the chalk!

1032
00:58:34,876 --> 00:58:36,753
Get the -
I did it - I closed 'em.

1033
00:58:36,836 --> 00:58:38,588
I closed the cocksucker.
Get the chalk.

1034
00:58:38,671 --> 00:58:42,175
Put me on the board, John.
Put me on the Cadillac board!

1035
00:58:42,258 --> 00:58:44,969
Williamson,
pick up the fucking chalk.

1036
00:58:45,053 --> 00:58:49,098
- Rick - eight units, Mountain View.
- You sold eight Mountain View?

1037
00:58:49,182 --> 00:58:51,517
You bet your ass!
Who wants to go to lunch?

1038
00:58:51,559 --> 00:58:53,686
Who wants to go to lunch -
I'm buying.

1039
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:57,482
Williamson - $82,000,
12 grand in my commission.

1040
00:58:57,565 --> 00:58:59,817
On deadbeat
magazine subscription leads.

1041
00:58:59,901 --> 00:59:02,528
- Who?
- Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.

1042
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:04,989
Read it.
What the hell happened here?

1043
00:59:05,073 --> 00:59:07,200
Fuck! I had them
on River Glen.

1044
00:59:07,283 --> 00:59:09,035
- What happened?
- Somebody broke in.

1045
00:59:09,118 --> 00:59:11,287
- Eight units!
- Yeah.

1046
00:59:11,371 --> 00:59:14,248
- Shelly!
- Big deal - I broke a bad streak.

1047
00:59:14,332 --> 00:59:16,542
Shelly "The Machine" Levene.
That's great.

1048
00:59:16,626 --> 00:59:18,544
Thank you, George.
Hey -

1049
00:59:18,628 --> 00:59:21,047
- grab the phone, call Mitch.
- They took the phones.

1050
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:22,715
- Huh?
- Aaronow?

1051
00:59:22,757 --> 00:59:25,051
They took the leads,
the cash, the contracts.

1052
00:59:25,093 --> 00:59:26,928
- We had a robbery.
- When?

1053
00:59:27,011 --> 00:59:29,722
- Last night, this morning.
- They took the leads?

1054
00:59:32,517 --> 00:59:34,519
Fucking asshole.

1055
00:59:34,602 --> 00:59:36,729
What? They beat you
with a rubber bat?

1056
00:59:36,813 --> 00:59:39,148
Cop couldn't find his dick
with two hands and a map.

1057
00:59:39,232 --> 00:59:41,567
Anybody who talks to this asshole
is a fucking asshole.

1058
00:59:41,651 --> 00:59:43,736
- You gonna turn state's?
- Fuck you, Ricky.

1059
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,698
I ain't going out today.
I'm going home.

1060
00:59:46,781 --> 00:59:49,075
I'm going home because nothing's
accomplished here.

1061
00:59:49,158 --> 00:59:51,202
- Anybody talks to this guy -
- Guess what "The Machine" did.

1062
00:59:51,285 --> 00:59:54,580
- Fuck "The Machine."
- Mountain View, eight units.

1063
00:59:54,664 --> 00:59:57,750
Cop's got no right to talk to me
that way. I did not rob the place.

1064
00:59:57,834 --> 01:00:00,962
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yeah, he closed the deal.

1065
01:00:01,045 --> 01:00:03,423
Eight units,
Mountain View.

1066
01:00:03,464 --> 01:00:06,009
- You did that?
- Yeah.

1067
01:00:07,218 --> 01:00:09,345
- Fuck you.
- Guess who?

1068
01:00:09,429 --> 01:00:11,014
- When?
- Just now.

1069
01:00:11,097 --> 01:00:13,391
- Guess who?
- You just - this morning?

1070
01:00:13,474 --> 01:00:15,935
Harriett
and blah blah Nyborg.

1071
01:00:16,019 --> 01:00:19,272
- You did that?
- Yeah - $82,000.

1072
01:00:20,356 --> 01:00:23,901
- Those fucking deadbeats.
- My ass. I told 'em - listen to this.

1073
01:00:23,985 --> 01:00:27,155
- I don't want to hear your war stories.
- Fuck you, Dave.

1074
01:00:27,238 --> 01:00:29,657
I said, "You have to believe
in yourself."

1075
01:00:29,741 --> 01:00:32,118
Give me a lead.
I'm going out. I'm getting out.

1076
01:00:32,201 --> 01:00:37,040
- Fuck the leads. I'm going home.
- "Fuck me, Bruce.

1077
01:00:37,123 --> 01:00:38,666
- You have to believe in yourself."
- We haven't got a lead.

1078
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:41,210
- Why not?
- They took 'em.

1079
01:00:41,294 --> 01:00:43,880
They're fucking garbage, any case.
The whole goddamn -

1080
01:00:43,963 --> 01:00:47,300
"You look around, you say,
'This one has so-and-so. I got nothing.

1081
01:00:47,342 --> 01:00:49,844
But why? Why don't I get
the opportunities?"'

1082
01:00:49,927 --> 01:00:52,513
- Did they steal the contracts?
- What the fuck do you care?

1083
01:00:52,597 --> 01:00:54,390
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

1084
01:00:54,474 --> 01:00:56,476
Will you shut up?
I'm telling him something.

1085
01:00:58,436 --> 01:01:00,104
Could we get
some coffee?

1086
01:01:00,188 --> 01:01:02,315
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

1087
01:01:04,317 --> 01:01:05,485
Uh-huh.

1088
01:01:05,568 --> 01:01:07,487
Anybody's going out,
I could use some coffee.

1089
01:01:09,864 --> 01:01:13,326
- "You do get the opportunity."
- Fuck is that supposed to mean?

1090
01:01:13,409 --> 01:01:15,703
"You do get the opportunities.
You get 'em as I get 'em,

1091
01:01:16,204 --> 01:01:18,498
- as everybody gets 'em."
- I don't care they stole the contracts?

1092
01:01:18,581 --> 01:01:20,708
I got 'em in the kitchen,
eating their crumb cake -

1093
01:01:20,792 --> 01:01:23,002
- What does that mean?
- It means, Dave,

1094
01:01:23,086 --> 01:01:25,338
You haven't closed
a good one in a month.

1095
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:27,215
None of my business,
you want to push me to answer you.

1096
01:01:27,298 --> 01:01:30,343
So you haven't got a contract
to get stolen and so forth.

1097
01:01:30,426 --> 01:01:33,262
You got a mean streak in you.
Shut the fuck up!

1098
01:01:33,346 --> 01:01:36,516
Ricky, you got a mean streak in you,
and what are you babbling about?

1099
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:38,476
You bring that shit up -
on my volume?

1100
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:41,688
If you were on a bad one and I
brought it up to you, you'd harbor it.

1101
01:01:41,771 --> 01:01:44,232
You'd harbor it a long while
and you'd be right.

1102
01:01:44,315 --> 01:01:46,693
- Who said "Fuck 'The Machine"'?
- Fuck "The Machine"?

1103
01:01:46,734 --> 01:01:49,278
Fuck "The Machine"?
Fuck "The Machine"!

1104
01:01:49,362 --> 01:01:52,699
What is this, courtesy class?
You're fucked, Rick.

1105
01:01:52,782 --> 01:01:55,535
Are you fucking nuts?
You're hot, so you think

1106
01:01:55,618 --> 01:01:57,203
- you're the ruler of this place.
- Wait a minute, Dave.

1107
01:01:57,286 --> 01:01:59,038
- Shut up!
- Okay...

1108
01:01:59,122 --> 01:02:01,624
You want to decide who
should be dealt with how, is that it?

1109
01:02:01,708 --> 01:02:04,585
I come into the office today,
I get humiliated by some jag-off cop.

1110
01:02:04,669 --> 01:02:06,546
I get accused of -

1111
01:02:06,629 --> 01:02:10,300
I get shit thrown in my face because
you're top name on the board?

1112
01:02:10,383 --> 01:02:13,219
Is that what I did, Dave -
I humiliated you?

1113
01:02:13,303 --> 01:02:16,848
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- Sitting on top of the world.

1114
01:02:16,931 --> 01:02:19,767
Sitting on top of the world -
everything's fucking peach fuzz.

1115
01:02:19,851 --> 01:02:23,062
I don't get a moment to spare
for some bust-out humanitarian

1116
01:02:23,146 --> 01:02:24,939
- down on his luck lately?
- Fuck you!

1117
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:26,816
Fuck you, Dave -
you know you got a big mouth.

1118
01:02:26,899 --> 01:02:30,111
You make a close, this whole place
stinks with your farts for a week -

1119
01:02:30,194 --> 01:02:34,532
how much you just ingested.
Oh, what a big man you are!

1120
01:02:34,615 --> 01:02:37,285
"Let me buy you a pack of gum -
I'll show you how to chew it."

1121
01:02:37,368 --> 01:02:40,330
Your pal closes, and all that comes
out of your mouth is bile.

1122
01:02:40,413 --> 01:02:43,583
How fucked-up you are!

1123
01:02:43,624 --> 01:02:48,504
Who's my pal, Ricky? Hmm?
And what are you?

1124
01:02:48,588 --> 01:02:51,924
What are you, huh,
Bishop Sheen?

1125
01:02:51,966 --> 01:02:54,093
What the fuck are you,
"Mr. Slick"?

1126
01:02:54,135 --> 01:02:56,763
What the fuck are you,
"Friend to the working man"?

1127
01:02:56,846 --> 01:02:59,223
Big deal!
Fuck you!

1128
01:03:01,517 --> 01:03:03,770
You got the memory
of a fucking fly!

1129
01:03:05,855 --> 01:03:08,775
I never liked you,
anyway.

1130
01:03:08,858 --> 01:03:10,985
What is this,
your farewell speech?

1131
01:03:11,069 --> 01:03:13,446
- I'm going home.
- Your farewell to the troops?

1132
01:03:13,529 --> 01:03:15,365
I'm not going home.
I'm going to Wisconsin.

1133
01:03:15,448 --> 01:03:17,909
- Have a good trip.
- Aw, fuck you!

1134
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:21,454
Fuck the lot of you!
Fuck you all!

1135
01:03:25,667 --> 01:03:27,460
You were saying?

1136
01:03:27,543 --> 01:03:30,254
Huh?

1137
01:03:30,338 --> 01:03:32,131
Come on.

1138
01:03:32,215 --> 01:03:34,467
Come on - you got 'em
in the kitchen,

1139
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:37,178
you're in
your shirtsleeves,

1140
01:03:37,261 --> 01:03:39,555
you got
the stats spread out,

1141
01:03:39,639 --> 01:03:42,892
you can smell it.
Come on, snap out of it.

1142
01:03:42,976 --> 01:03:46,312
- You're eating her crumb cake.
- Oh yeah, I'm eating her crumb cake.

1143
01:03:46,396 --> 01:03:49,524
- How was it?
- From the store.

1144
01:03:49,607 --> 01:03:52,151
- Fuck her.
- "Bruce, Harriett...

1145
01:03:52,235 --> 01:03:56,114
we have to admit to ourselves
that we see that opportunity

1146
01:03:56,197 --> 01:03:59,617
and take it - and that's it."
Now, we just sit there.

1147
01:03:59,701 --> 01:04:01,494
- I got my pen out.
- "Always Be Closing."

1148
01:04:01,577 --> 01:04:04,080
God, that's what
I've been saying - the old ways.

1149
01:04:04,163 --> 01:04:07,667
Convert that motherfucker,
sell him, make him sign the check.

1150
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:09,627
They got their money
in government bonds -

1151
01:04:09,711 --> 01:04:13,298
I said, "Fuck it - let's go
all the way, the whole route."

1152
01:04:13,381 --> 01:04:17,677
I take it and plat it out - eight units,
82 grand, and I say to them,

1153
01:04:17,719 --> 01:04:22,849
"This is now. This is that thing
that you have been dreaming of.

1154
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:25,393
You are going to find
the suitcase on the train.

1155
01:04:25,476 --> 01:04:28,688
The man walks in the room,
that bag is filled with money.

1156
01:04:28,771 --> 01:04:32,317
Harriett, this is it, and Bruce -
I don't want to fuck around with you.

1157
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,570
No, I don't. I don't want
to pussyfoot around.

1158
01:04:35,653 --> 01:04:38,865
You think you got to look back
on this thing? I do, too.

1159
01:04:38,948 --> 01:04:42,410
Now, I'm here to do good
for you and me - the both of us.

1160
01:04:42,452 --> 01:04:45,747
What is the point
of some interim position?

1161
01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:49,417
The only arrangement
I will accept is full investment.

1162
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,545
And I mean it, that's it -
all eight units. Period."

1163
01:04:52,629 --> 01:04:55,214
Now I got the pen
in my hand, Rick - hey.

1164
01:04:55,298 --> 01:05:00,136
I turned that contract around -
that's eight units, 82 grand -

1165
01:05:00,219 --> 01:05:04,265
and I said,
"I want you to sign."

1166
01:05:04,349 --> 01:05:07,352
I sat there five minutes.

1167
01:05:07,435 --> 01:05:12,857
Then I sat 22 minutes
by that kitchen clock on the wall.

1168
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:15,735
Ricky - not a word,
not a motion.

1169
01:05:15,777 --> 01:05:18,446
And what am I thinking?
"Is my arm getting tired?"

1170
01:05:18,529 --> 01:05:21,366
No. I did it.
Just like the old days,

1171
01:05:21,449 --> 01:05:23,076
like I used to,
like I was taught.

1172
01:05:23,117 --> 01:05:25,244
- I did it.
- Like you taught me.

1173
01:05:25,286 --> 01:05:28,373
Nobody ever -
well, if I did, I'm glad.

1174
01:05:28,456 --> 01:05:30,500
No, what I did -
I locked on 'em.

1175
01:05:30,583 --> 01:05:33,211
I locked all on them -
nothing on me - on them.

1176
01:05:33,294 --> 01:05:36,381
And, oh God, I am holding
my last thought,

1177
01:05:36,464 --> 01:05:39,092
"Now is the time."

1178
01:05:40,176 --> 01:05:43,763
They signed.
It was great.

1179
01:05:43,846 --> 01:05:46,557
It was so fucking great.

1180
01:05:46,641 --> 01:05:50,520
It was like
they wilted all at once.

1181
01:05:50,603 --> 01:05:53,231
- Mmm.
- No gesture, nothing - just together.

1182
01:05:53,314 --> 01:05:58,403
Honest to God, they both
imperceptibly slumped.

1183
01:05:58,486 --> 01:06:02,115
And then he reached
and he took the pen and he signed,

1184
01:06:02,156 --> 01:06:04,283
passed it to her
and she signed.

1185
01:06:04,367 --> 01:06:06,619
It was solemn -
fucking solemn.

1186
01:06:06,703 --> 01:06:11,708
I let it sit, and then I nodded.
I said, "Harriett, Bruce,"

1187
01:06:11,791 --> 01:06:14,210
then I pointed into the living room
to the sideboard.

1188
01:06:14,294 --> 01:06:16,504
I didn't know there was
a sideboard in there.

1189
01:06:16,587 --> 01:06:18,589
He went over,
he brought us back a drink -

1190
01:06:18,673 --> 01:06:22,135
little shot glasses
with a pretty design in 'em.

1191
01:06:23,761 --> 01:06:27,390
And we just toasted
in silence.

1192
01:06:27,473 --> 01:06:30,935
Great sale, Shelly.

1193
01:06:31,019 --> 01:06:33,021
Great.

1194
01:06:33,104 --> 01:06:36,024
Fuck! Send me out!
Give me leads!

1195
01:06:36,107 --> 01:06:37,108
- Williamson! Send me out!
- Whoa!

1196
01:06:37,859 --> 01:06:39,819
- The leads are coming.
- Get 'em to me.

1197
01:06:39,902 --> 01:06:42,530
I talked to Mitch and Murray
an hour ago. They're coming in.

1198
01:06:42,613 --> 01:06:45,241
- They're a bit upset over this.
- Did you tell 'em my sale?

1199
01:06:45,325 --> 01:06:47,702
How could I tell 'em your sale?
I didn't have a tele -

1200
01:06:47,785 --> 01:06:50,121
I'll tell 'em your sale
when they bring in the leads.

1201
01:06:50,204 --> 01:06:53,124
We had a little - you closed the deal,
you made a good sale. Fine.

1202
01:06:53,207 --> 01:06:56,085
- Better than a good sale.
- I have a lot of things on my mind.

1203
01:06:56,169 --> 01:06:59,339
They're coming and they're very upset.
I'm trying to make -

1204
01:06:59,422 --> 01:07:02,175
All I'm telling you is, you can tell
them it was a remarkably good sale.

1205
01:07:02,258 --> 01:07:05,011
The only thing remarkable
about it is who you made it to.

1206
01:07:05,053 --> 01:07:08,514
- What the fuck does that mean?
- If the sale sticks it'll be a miracle.

1207
01:07:08,598 --> 01:07:10,892
"If the sale sticks"?
Why shouldn't the sale stick?

1208
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:14,979
Oh, fuck you!
You do not know your job.

1209
01:07:15,063 --> 01:07:16,898
Do you know that?
A man is his job!

1210
01:07:16,981 --> 01:07:19,984
You are fucked at yours.
You hear what I'm saying to you?

1211
01:07:20,068 --> 01:07:22,153
Your "End of the Month"
fucking boar -

1212
01:07:22,236 --> 01:07:24,030
you do not know how
to run this office.

1213
01:07:24,072 --> 01:07:26,491
You haven't got the sense.
You haven't got the balls.

1214
01:07:26,574 --> 01:07:29,702
Have you ever been on a sit?
Has this cocksucker been on a sit?

1215
01:07:29,786 --> 01:07:32,538
- Did you ever sit -
- If I were you, I would calm down.

1216
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:34,540
Would you?
What are you gonna do, fire me?

1217
01:07:34,624 --> 01:07:36,542
Oh, oh, Rick, ooh.

1218
01:07:36,584 --> 01:07:39,879
- It's not impossible.
- Really? On an $80,000 day?

1219
01:07:39,921 --> 01:07:42,382
- It's not even noon yet.
- You closed 'em today?

1220
01:07:42,465 --> 01:07:45,134
I got up early this morning,
tracked 'em down, and closed it.

1221
01:07:45,218 --> 01:07:48,513
What I'm saying to you
is that things change.

1222
01:07:48,596 --> 01:07:51,933
That's where you fuck up.
You don't know. You can't look back.

1223
01:07:52,016 --> 01:07:56,062
You don't see who's coming.
Maybe it's someone new, huh?

1224
01:07:56,145 --> 01:07:58,314
Maybe it's someone else,
but you don't know -

1225
01:07:58,398 --> 01:08:01,067
you can't look back, because
you don't know your history!

1226
01:08:01,109 --> 01:08:03,486
When we were on Rio Rancho,
who was the top man, huh?

1227
01:08:03,569 --> 01:08:05,488
For what,
two months, three months?

1228
01:08:05,571 --> 01:08:08,533
How about eight months,
for three years in a row!

1229
01:08:08,616 --> 01:08:12,370
Luck - was that it, John?
Or purloined fucking leads?

1230
01:08:12,453 --> 01:08:14,247
- It was talent!
- Yes.

1231
01:08:14,330 --> 01:08:17,875
Door to door.
It's called "cold calling," John.

1232
01:08:17,959 --> 01:08:21,337
Shit, I don't even know their name.
They don't want to buy what I've got.

1233
01:08:21,421 --> 01:08:24,090
Soft sell - we were doing it
before we had a name for it.

1234
01:08:24,173 --> 01:08:26,050
- Am I right?
- You're right, you're right.

1235
01:08:26,134 --> 01:08:29,971
You wouldn't know, you cock -
he doesn't even know what a streak is.

1236
01:08:30,054 --> 01:08:32,432
What the hell are you?

1237
01:08:32,473 --> 01:08:35,226
You're a fucking secretary.
Fuck you!

1238
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:38,688
That's my message to you -
fuck you, and kiss my ass.

1239
01:08:38,771 --> 01:08:42,525
If you don't like that, I go across
the street and speak to Jerry Graff.

1240
01:08:42,608 --> 01:08:44,444
Period. Fuck you.

1241
01:08:44,527 --> 01:08:47,697
Listen to me - you put me
on that fucking board,

1242
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:50,241
and I want three
promising leads for today,

1243
01:08:50,325 --> 01:08:53,328
I don't want any bullshit,
and I want 'em close together,

1244
01:08:53,411 --> 01:08:55,580
because I am
going to close them all.

1245
01:08:55,663 --> 01:08:58,875
And that's all I have
to say to you.

1246
01:09:00,209 --> 01:09:03,254
He's right, Williamson.

1247
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:09,135
I'm sorry, but it's wrong,
and you know whose fault it is?

1248
01:09:09,177 --> 01:09:10,762
Mitch and Murray.

1249
01:09:13,348 --> 01:09:16,100
To hell with him.
Let's get some lunch, huh, Rick?

1250
01:09:16,184 --> 01:09:18,311
The leads won't be
up here till later anyway.

1251
01:09:18,394 --> 01:09:21,773
You're a client. I just sold you
five waterfront Glengarry Farms.

1252
01:09:21,856 --> 01:09:24,651
I do this with my hair,
throw me the cue "Kenilworth."

1253
01:09:24,692 --> 01:09:27,153
- Which is it?
- Kenilworth.

1254
01:09:27,195 --> 01:09:29,906
I own the property.
My mother owns the property.

1255
01:09:29,989 --> 01:09:31,741
I put her into it.

1256
01:09:31,824 --> 01:09:34,994
You look on the plats
when you go home. You'll see...

1257
01:09:35,078 --> 01:09:37,830
A-3 through 10,
26 through 30.

1258
01:09:37,872 --> 01:09:41,626
- Take your time. If you still feel -
- I won't need more time, Rick.

1259
01:09:41,709 --> 01:09:43,795
- I've bought a lot of property.
- I've got to talk to you.

1260
01:09:43,878 --> 01:09:46,297
Jim, what are you
doing here?

1261
01:09:46,381 --> 01:09:49,592
Jim Lingk,
D. Ray Morton.

1262
01:09:49,676 --> 01:09:52,720
- I'm glad to meet you.
- I put Jim into Black Creek.

1263
01:09:52,804 --> 01:09:55,682
- Are you acquainted with -
- Black Creek? No.

1264
01:09:55,765 --> 01:09:57,558
- Ooh, in Florida!
- Yes.

1265
01:09:57,642 --> 01:10:00,812
- I meant to speak to you about that.
- We'll do that this weekend.

1266
01:10:00,895 --> 01:10:02,605
My wife suggested
I look into it.

1267
01:10:02,689 --> 01:10:05,441
Beautiful rolling land -
I was telling Jim and Jinny.

1268
01:10:05,525 --> 01:10:08,903
Ray, I got to tell you something.
You eat in a lot of restaurants?

1269
01:10:08,987 --> 01:10:11,864
I know you do.
Ray is with American Express.

1270
01:10:11,906 --> 01:10:13,783
- Can I tell Jim what you do?
- Sure.

1271
01:10:13,866 --> 01:10:17,328
Ray is the director of all
European sales and services -

1272
01:10:17,412 --> 01:10:20,456
what I'm saying is, you haven't had
a meal until you've tasted -

1273
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:22,333
I was at the Lingks' -

1274
01:10:22,417 --> 01:10:24,877
what was that service feature
you were talking about?

1275
01:10:24,919 --> 01:10:26,629
- Which -
- "Home cooking."

1276
01:10:26,713 --> 01:10:29,549
- You had a tag phrase you used?
- "Cooking"...

1277
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:31,217
"Home cook -"
the monthly interview.

1278
01:10:31,301 --> 01:10:33,469
- The magazine!
- Yes.

1279
01:10:33,553 --> 01:10:35,888
Is that something
I can talk about?

1280
01:10:35,972 --> 01:10:39,183
It won't be out until
the February issue, but go ahead.

1281
01:10:39,267 --> 01:10:40,893
- Are you sure?
- Go ahead.

1282
01:10:40,977 --> 01:10:44,022
Ray was eating at one of his
company men's homes in France.

1283
01:10:44,105 --> 01:10:46,149
- The man is French?
- No, but his wife is.

1284
01:10:46,232 --> 01:10:47,859
His wife.

1285
01:10:47,942 --> 01:10:50,528
Ray, what time
do you have?

1286
01:10:50,611 --> 01:10:53,406
- 12:15.
- I got to get you on the plane.

1287
01:10:53,448 --> 01:10:55,241
- Didn't I say the 2:00?
- No, the 1:00.

1288
01:10:55,325 --> 01:10:58,244
Remember the 1:00 - that's why
we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.

1289
01:10:58,328 --> 01:11:00,455
You're right, the 1:00 -
let's scoot.

1290
01:11:00,538 --> 01:11:02,665
- A pleasure.
- I got to talk to you.

1291
01:11:02,749 --> 01:11:05,835
I got to run Ray to the airport.
Let's hustle - John!

1292
01:11:05,918 --> 01:11:09,422
Get on the phone to Pittsburgh,
American Express there, for Mr. Morton.

1293
01:11:09,505 --> 01:11:12,800
Tell them he's on the 1:00.
I'll see you.

1294
01:11:12,884 --> 01:11:15,345
Christ, I'm sorry
you came all the way in.

1295
01:11:15,428 --> 01:11:18,473
I'm running Ray to the airport.
You wait here and -

1296
01:11:18,556 --> 01:11:21,142
no, I can't. I'm meeting your man
at the bank.

1297
01:11:21,225 --> 01:11:25,063
I wish you'd have phoned!
Are you and Jinny going to be home?

1298
01:11:25,146 --> 01:11:26,564
- I don't know.
- Rick?

1299
01:11:26,648 --> 01:11:28,149
- What?
- Kenilworth?

1300
01:11:28,232 --> 01:11:29,942
- I'm sorry?
- Kenilworth.

1301
01:11:30,026 --> 01:11:32,945
Oh, God. Excuse me, Ray -
just a minute.

1302
01:11:32,987 --> 01:11:37,533
Jim, I told you who he is - the senior
vice-president of American Express.

1303
01:11:37,617 --> 01:11:39,786
His family owns 32 per -

1304
01:11:39,869 --> 01:11:43,790
over the past years, I have sold him -
I can't tell you the dollar amount -

1305
01:11:43,831 --> 01:11:46,501
but quite a lot of land.

1306
01:11:46,584 --> 01:11:50,046
I promised him five weeks ago that I
would go to the wife's birthday party

1307
01:11:50,129 --> 01:11:52,632
in Kenilworth tonight.
I have to go, you understand?

1308
01:11:52,715 --> 01:11:55,802
They treat me like a member
of the family. I have to go.

1309
01:11:55,885 --> 01:12:00,098
It's funny - you get a picture
of the corporation-type company man,

1310
01:12:00,181 --> 01:12:02,642
all business -
this guy, I'll tell you.

1311
01:12:02,684 --> 01:12:04,644
We'll go to his house
someday.

1312
01:12:04,686 --> 01:12:08,856
Let me see. Tomorrow.
I'm in L.A.?

1313
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:11,275
Ah, Monday.

1314
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:13,695
I'll take you to lunch.
Where would you like to eat?

1315
01:12:13,778 --> 01:12:15,196
- My wife -
- Rick?

1316
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:18,574
I can't talk now, Jim -
I'll call you tonight. Coming, Ray.

1317
01:12:18,658 --> 01:12:20,952
My wife said I have
to cancel the deal.

1318
01:12:22,662 --> 01:12:25,206
That's a common reaction, Jim,
and let me tell you what it is.

1319
01:12:25,289 --> 01:12:28,167
That's why you married her.
One of the reasons is prudence.

1320
01:12:28,209 --> 01:12:31,004
No, it's a sizable investment.
One thinks twice.

1321
01:12:31,045 --> 01:12:36,009
It's also something women have.
Reaction to the size of the investment.

1322
01:12:36,551 --> 01:12:38,344
Monday, you invite me
to dinner again -

1323
01:12:38,386 --> 01:12:40,305
- This woman can cook.
- I'm sure she can.

1324
01:12:40,388 --> 01:12:43,057
We are going to talk.
I want to tell you something.

1325
01:12:43,141 --> 01:12:46,185
Something about your acreage
I want you to know.

1326
01:12:46,269 --> 01:12:50,023
I can't talk about it here,
I really shouldn't, and by law -

1327
01:12:50,106 --> 01:12:54,444
the man next to you -
bought his lot at 42 -

1328
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:56,529
phoned to say
he already had an offer.

1329
01:12:56,612 --> 01:12:58,281
- Rick.
- I'm coming.

1330
01:12:58,364 --> 01:13:00,825
Ray, what a day.
I'll call you this evening.

1331
01:13:00,908 --> 01:13:04,203
I'm sorry you had to come
all the way in. Monday lunch.

1332
01:13:04,287 --> 01:13:05,997
- We have to go.
- Monday!

1333
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:09,751
She called the consumer -
the attorney general?

1334
01:13:09,834 --> 01:13:12,211
- They said we have three days.
- Who'd she call?

1335
01:13:12,295 --> 01:13:15,381
The attorney ge -
it was some consumer office.

1336
01:13:16,549 --> 01:13:18,885
Why'd she do that, Jim?

1337
01:13:18,926 --> 01:13:20,762
I don't know.

1338
01:13:20,845 --> 01:13:22,680
But they said
we have three days.

1339
01:13:22,764 --> 01:13:25,850
They said
we got three days, yeah.

1340
01:13:25,933 --> 01:13:27,935
Three days?

1341
01:13:28,019 --> 01:13:32,065
- To... you know.
- No, I don't know.

1342
01:13:32,148 --> 01:13:35,693
- Tell me.
- To change our minds.

1343
01:13:35,777 --> 01:13:38,696
Of course you have -
three days.

1344
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:41,240
So we can't talk Monday.

1345
01:13:41,282 --> 01:13:43,910
Monday -
you saw my book.

1346
01:13:43,993 --> 01:13:46,579
Jim, Jim - I can't.

1347
01:13:46,663 --> 01:13:48,539
You saw my book.
I can't.

1348
01:13:48,623 --> 01:13:50,667
We have to before Monday
to get our money back.

1349
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:52,752
Three business days,
they mean.

1350
01:13:52,835 --> 01:13:55,254
- Three business days.
- Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

1351
01:13:55,338 --> 01:13:58,591
- I don't understand.
- That's what they are, three business -

1352
01:13:58,675 --> 01:14:00,760
if we wait till Monday,
my time limit runs out.

1353
01:14:00,843 --> 01:14:02,929
- You don't count Saturday.
- I'm not.

1354
01:14:03,012 --> 01:14:05,682
I'm saying you don't include
Saturday in the three days.

1355
01:14:05,765 --> 01:14:09,102
- It's not a business day.
- I am not counting it.

1356
01:14:09,185 --> 01:14:13,856
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday -
so it would have elapsed.

1357
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:15,858
What would have elapsed?

1358
01:14:15,942 --> 01:14:17,694
If we wait till Monday
it would have elapsed!

1359
01:14:17,777 --> 01:14:20,029
- When did you write the check?
- Yesterday.

1360
01:14:20,113 --> 01:14:21,781
- What was yesterday?
- Tuesday.

1361
01:14:21,864 --> 01:14:24,951
- And when was that check cashed?
- I don't know.

1362
01:14:25,034 --> 01:14:27,412
What was the earliest
it could have been cashed?

1363
01:14:27,453 --> 01:14:30,832
- I don't know.
- Today.

1364
01:14:30,915 --> 01:14:34,127
Today. Which, in any case,
it was not -

1365
01:14:34,168 --> 01:14:37,297
there was something on the agreement
I wanted to go over with you.

1366
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:39,382
It wasn't cashed?

1367
01:14:39,465 --> 01:14:41,634
I just phoned downtown -
it's on their desk.

1368
01:14:41,718 --> 01:14:43,886
- Rick.
- One moment.

1369
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:46,764
One point, in fact, of which
I spoke to you of which,

1370
01:14:46,848 --> 01:14:48,850
I can't talk to you
about it here.

1371
01:14:48,933 --> 01:14:51,227
- Levene!
- Listen to me.

1372
01:14:51,311 --> 01:14:55,273
The statute is for your protection.
I have no complaint with that.

1373
01:14:55,356 --> 01:14:57,608
In fact, I was a member
of the board when we drafted it.

1374
01:14:57,692 --> 01:14:59,652
So quite the opposite.
It says,

1375
01:14:59,694 --> 01:15:02,447
"You can change your mind
three 'working days'

1376
01:15:02,488 --> 01:15:04,365
from the time
the deal was closed."

1377
01:15:04,449 --> 01:15:06,409
- Levene!
- Wait a second!

1378
01:15:06,492 --> 01:15:08,661
Which is not until
the check is cashed!

1379
01:15:08,703 --> 01:15:12,165
I'm through with this "meshugaas."
Nobody should talk to a man that way.

1380
01:15:12,206 --> 01:15:14,500
- How are you talking to me that way?
- Levene!

1381
01:15:14,584 --> 01:15:17,503
- How can you talk to me that way?
- I'm gonna flag a cab.

1382
01:15:17,587 --> 01:15:20,506
- I didn't rob -
- Shelly, get in the office.

1383
01:15:20,548 --> 01:15:23,676
"Where were you last?"
Is anybody listening to me?

1384
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,513
- Where's Moss?
- Is this Levene?

1385
01:15:27,597 --> 01:15:30,516
Perhaps I could assist you.
Excuse us, will you?

1386
01:15:30,558 --> 01:15:34,062
I work here! I didn't come in here
to be mistreated!

1387
01:15:34,145 --> 01:15:36,856
- Go to lunch, will you?
- That's why I came in to work today.

1388
01:15:36,939 --> 01:15:38,691
The leads come in,
I'll let you know.

1389
01:15:38,733 --> 01:15:40,693
- That's why I came in!
- Just go to lunch.

1390
01:15:40,735 --> 01:15:42,987
- I don't wanna go to lunch!
- Go to lunch, George.

1391
01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:44,989
Where does he get off
talking that way to a working man?

1392
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:47,200
Take it outside. We have people
trying to do business.

1393
01:15:47,283 --> 01:15:49,410
That's what I came in here for.
That's what I'm trying to do!

1394
01:15:49,494 --> 01:15:51,996
- I meet Gestapo tactics.
- Excuse me.

1395
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,123
I meet Gestapo tactics!

1396
01:15:54,207 --> 01:15:56,501
I meet Gestapo tactics.
That's not right.

1397
01:15:56,542 --> 01:16:02,340
No man has the right -
no man has the right -

1398
01:16:02,423 --> 01:16:06,511
"Call an attorney" -
that means you're under -

1399
01:16:06,552 --> 01:16:08,513
he says, "Cooperate
or we'll take you downtown."

1400
01:16:08,554 --> 01:16:10,556
That's not -
as long as I've -

1401
01:16:10,598 --> 01:16:12,058
Will you get out of here?

1402
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:14,894
Will you get out of here?
Will you?

1403
01:16:14,936 --> 01:16:17,897
I'm trying to run an office here.
Now, will you go to lunch?

1404
01:16:17,981 --> 01:16:22,193
Go to lunch.
Will you go to lunch?

1405
01:16:35,748 --> 01:16:37,917
- Excuse me.
- Where did Moss...?

1406
01:16:38,001 --> 01:16:41,129
- Excuse me, please?
- Did he go to the restaurant?

1407
01:16:41,212 --> 01:16:43,506
Will you
excuse me, please?

1408
01:16:47,135 --> 01:16:49,679
I'm sorry, I -

1409
01:16:51,097 --> 01:16:54,434
I apologize to you. It's -

1410
01:16:54,517 --> 01:16:57,061
It's not me,
it's my wife.

1411
01:16:59,147 --> 01:17:00,940
What is it?

1412
01:17:00,982 --> 01:17:03,026
- I told you.
- Tell me again.

1413
01:17:03,109 --> 01:17:05,987
- What's going on here?
- Tell me again - your wife?

1414
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:08,239
- I told you.
- Tell me again.

1415
01:17:08,781 --> 01:17:10,867
She wants her money back.

1416
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:12,702
We're gonna speak to her.

1417
01:17:12,785 --> 01:17:15,288
No, she told me,
"Right now."

1418
01:17:15,371 --> 01:17:17,749
- We're gonna speak to her, Jim.
- She won't listen.

1419
01:17:17,790 --> 01:17:19,626
- She -
- Roma!

1420
01:17:19,709 --> 01:17:23,254
She said if don't get my money back,
to call the state's attorney.

1421
01:17:23,338 --> 01:17:25,131
No. No.
This is something she said.

1422
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:27,592
- We don't have to do that.
- She told me I have to.

1423
01:17:27,634 --> 01:17:29,802
- No, Jim.
- I do.

1424
01:17:29,886 --> 01:17:31,596
Listen, I do -
if I don't get my money back -

1425
01:17:31,638 --> 01:17:33,556
Roma,
I'm talking to you.

1426
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:37,477
Listen - will someone
get this guy off my back, please?

1427
01:17:37,518 --> 01:17:40,772
- You have a problem?
- Yes, I have a problem!

1428
01:17:40,813 --> 01:17:42,357
Yes, I do, my friend.
It is not me

1429
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:45,318
that ripped the joint off.
I'm doing business.

1430
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:48,988
I will be with you
in a while, got it?

1431
01:17:49,072 --> 01:17:52,450
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

1432
01:17:54,744 --> 01:17:56,746
This is me!

1433
01:17:56,829 --> 01:18:00,583
Jim, this is
Ricky, Jim.

1434
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:05,922
Jim, anything you want,
you want it, you got it.

1435
01:18:06,005 --> 01:18:08,466
Understand?
This is me.

1436
01:18:08,549 --> 01:18:11,010
Something upset you.

1437
01:18:11,052 --> 01:18:13,346
Yes.
Sit down now.

1438
01:18:13,429 --> 01:18:17,350
Sit down.
You tell me what it is,

1439
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:20,770
am I gonna
help you fix it?

1440
01:18:20,853 --> 01:18:22,897
You're goddamned
right I am.

1441
01:18:22,981 --> 01:18:25,483
Sit down.

1442
01:18:25,566 --> 01:18:28,152
I'll tell you something,

1443
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:33,032
sometimes we need
someone from outside.

1444
01:18:35,994 --> 01:18:38,579
Sit. Talk to me,
come on.

1445
01:18:42,792 --> 01:18:45,461
I can't negotiate.

1446
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:48,798
What does that mean?

1447
01:18:50,091 --> 01:18:52,552
What?

1448
01:18:54,429 --> 01:18:56,514
What?
Say the words.

1449
01:18:56,597 --> 01:18:59,392
I don't have the power.

1450
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:01,519
Okay, I said it.

1451
01:19:01,602 --> 01:19:05,023
- What power?
- To negotiate.

1452
01:19:05,106 --> 01:19:07,066
To negotiate what?

1453
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:11,279
To negotiate what?

1454
01:19:11,362 --> 01:19:13,197
This.

1455
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:15,366
- What this?
- The deal.

1456
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:17,327
The deal?

1457
01:19:17,410 --> 01:19:19,370
Forget the deal, Jim.

1458
01:19:19,454 --> 01:19:22,415
You got something on your mind,
what is it?

1459
01:19:22,498 --> 01:19:25,168
What?

1460
01:19:27,462 --> 01:19:29,797
I can't talk to you.

1461
01:19:29,881 --> 01:19:32,342
You met my wife.

1462
01:19:32,425 --> 01:19:35,345
- What?
- Aw...

1463
01:19:37,555 --> 01:19:39,682
I met your wife,
what?

1464
01:19:43,811 --> 01:19:46,105
What, Jim?

1465
01:19:48,107 --> 01:19:50,568
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, let's go.

1466
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:51,861
Get a drink,
come on.

1467
01:19:51,944 --> 01:19:54,113
No, no, she told me
not to talk to you.

1468
01:19:54,197 --> 01:19:56,074
Come on, we're gonna
go around the corner.

1469
01:19:56,115 --> 01:19:57,700
We'll have a drink.
Who's gonna know?

1470
01:19:57,784 --> 01:19:59,786
She told me to get
the check back, otherwise -

1471
01:19:59,869 --> 01:20:01,913
Forget the deal, Jimmy.
Forget the deal.

1472
01:20:01,955 --> 01:20:05,458
The deal is dead.
You know me, the deal's dead.

1473
01:20:05,541 --> 01:20:07,919
Am I talking
about the deal?

1474
01:20:07,961 --> 01:20:10,338
That's over.

1475
01:20:10,421 --> 01:20:13,091
Please -
let's talk about you.

1476
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:22,433
I'm gonna tell you
something.

1477
01:20:22,517 --> 01:20:24,811
Your life is your own.

1478
01:20:26,688 --> 01:20:28,856
You have a contract
with your wife,

1479
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:31,943
you have certain things
you do jointly,

1480
01:20:32,026 --> 01:20:35,196
you have a bond there.
And there are other things,

1481
01:20:35,279 --> 01:20:41,285
and those things are yours.
You needn't feel ashamed.

1482
01:20:41,369 --> 01:20:43,955
You needn't feel
that you're being untrue

1483
01:20:43,997 --> 01:20:48,209
or that she would
abandon you if she knew.

1484
01:20:48,293 --> 01:20:51,462
This is your life.

1485
01:20:56,718 --> 01:20:58,553
Yes?

1486
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:04,726
Now, I want to talk to you
because you're obviously upset,

1487
01:21:04,809 --> 01:21:07,812
and that concerns me.

1488
01:21:07,895 --> 01:21:10,315
Let's go,
come on, right now.

1489
01:21:10,398 --> 01:21:12,108
Let's go, come on.

1490
01:21:12,191 --> 01:21:14,444
Roma.

1491
01:21:14,527 --> 01:21:17,238
- What?
- The check, it's -

1492
01:21:18,698 --> 01:21:20,867
What did I tell you?

1493
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:22,827
No, what did I tell you
about the three days?

1494
01:21:22,869 --> 01:21:24,829
Roma, would you?
I'd like to get some lunch.

1495
01:21:25,204 --> 01:21:29,334
I am talking with Mr. Lingk,
if you please.

1496
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:33,338
I will be with you in a while.
Just check with Mr. Williamson.

1497
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:37,216
- People downtown said -
- Call them again. Mr. Williamson!

1498
01:21:37,258 --> 01:21:39,344
Yes?

1499
01:21:39,427 --> 01:21:41,471
Mr. Lingk and I
are going to go to the -

1500
01:21:41,554 --> 01:21:44,307
Oh, yes, please.
The police can be -

1501
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:46,976
- What are the police doing here?
- It's nothing.

1502
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:50,855
- What are the police doing here?
- We had a slight burglary last night.

1503
01:21:50,897 --> 01:21:53,066
It's nothing,
I was just assuring Mr. Lingk.

1504
01:21:53,149 --> 01:21:55,526
Mr. Lingk? James Lingk?
Your contract went out.

1505
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:57,487
- Nothing to worry about.
- John, John -

1506
01:21:57,570 --> 01:21:59,364
- Your contract went out to the bank.
- You cashed my check?

1507
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:01,366
- Mr. Williamson -
- The check was cashed.

1508
01:22:01,449 --> 01:22:04,077
The contract was filed
and deposited in the bank,

1509
01:22:04,118 --> 01:22:06,537
and we're completely insured
in any case, as you know.

1510
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:10,708
- You cashed the check?
- Not to my knowledge, no.

1511
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:13,586
- Though I'm sure we can -
- Not to my knowledge.

1512
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:16,923
Christ! I -
Oh, Christ.

1513
01:22:17,006 --> 01:22:19,467
Don't follow me,
just don't follow me, okay?

1514
01:22:22,053 --> 01:22:24,681
I've let you down.
I know I've let you down.

1515
01:22:24,764 --> 01:22:28,017
I'm sorry, forgive me. I-I -

1516
01:22:29,352 --> 01:22:32,105
I don't -
I don't know anymore.

1517
01:22:33,648 --> 01:22:38,236
I... forgive me.

1518
01:22:52,125 --> 01:22:54,877
You stupid fucking cunt.

1519
01:22:56,254 --> 01:22:58,381
You, Williamson,
I'm talking to you, shithead.

1520
01:22:58,464 --> 01:23:01,092
You just cost me
$6,000.

1521
01:23:01,134 --> 01:23:07,724
$6,000, and one Cadillac.
That's right.

1522
01:23:07,807 --> 01:23:10,143
What are you gonna
do about it?

1523
01:23:10,226 --> 01:23:14,772
What are you
gonna do about it, asshole?

1524
01:23:14,856 --> 01:23:16,774
You're fucking shit.

1525
01:23:16,858 --> 01:23:19,235
Where did you
learn your trade,

1526
01:23:19,319 --> 01:23:22,155
you stupid fucking cunt,
you idiot?

1527
01:23:22,196 --> 01:23:24,657
Who ever told you
that you could work with men?

1528
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:26,117
Could I...?

1529
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:28,661
Oh, I'm gonna have
your job, shithead.

1530
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:31,456
I'm going downtown.
I'm gonna talk to Mitch and Murray.

1531
01:23:31,497 --> 01:23:35,543
I'm going to Lemkin!
I don't care whose nephew you are,

1532
01:23:35,627 --> 01:23:38,630
who you know,
whose dick you're sucking on,

1533
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:41,049
you're going out.
I swear to you -

1534
01:23:41,132 --> 01:23:43,760
Hey, fella,
let's get this done.

1535
01:23:45,762 --> 01:23:49,265
Anyone in this office
lives on his wits -

1536
01:23:49,349 --> 01:23:52,060
I'm gonna be with you
in a second.

1537
01:23:54,771 --> 01:23:58,441
What you're hired for
is to help us.

1538
01:23:58,524 --> 01:24:01,319
Does that seem
clear to you?

1539
01:24:01,361 --> 01:24:06,240
To help us!
Not to fuck us up!

1540
01:24:06,324 --> 01:24:09,494
To help men who are
going out there

1541
01:24:09,535 --> 01:24:13,039
to try to earn a living,
you fairy.

1542
01:24:13,122 --> 01:24:14,874
You company man.

1543
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:17,919
I'll tell you something else,
I hope you ripped the joint off.

1544
01:24:18,002 --> 01:24:21,506
I can tell our friend here something,
might help him to catch you.

1545
01:24:26,511 --> 01:24:28,888
You wanna learn
the first rule

1546
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:31,933
you'd know if you ever
spent a day in your life?

1547
01:24:32,016 --> 01:24:37,397
You never open your mouth
till you know what the shot is.

1548
01:24:39,232 --> 01:24:41,943
You fucking child.

1549
01:24:54,205 --> 01:24:57,292
You are a shithead,
Williamson.

1550
01:24:59,168 --> 01:25:02,297
Can't think on your feet,
you ought to keep your mouth closed.

1551
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:05,550
Can you hear me?
I'm talking to you.

1552
01:25:05,591 --> 01:25:07,427
Yes, I hear you.

1553
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:10,638
Ricky's right. Can't learn in an office,
gotta learn it in the street.

1554
01:25:10,722 --> 01:25:12,932
And you sure can't buy it,
you gotta live it.

1555
01:25:12,974 --> 01:25:14,976
- Mmmm.
- "Mmmm," yeah!

1556
01:25:15,059 --> 01:25:18,313
Precisely.
Because your partner depends -

1557
01:25:18,396 --> 01:25:20,315
I'm talking to you,
trying to tell you something!

1558
01:25:20,398 --> 01:25:21,482
- You are?
- Yeah, I am.

1559
01:25:21,566 --> 01:25:23,985
- What are you trying to tell me?
- What Roma was trying to tell you.

1560
01:25:24,068 --> 01:25:27,405
What I told you a long time ago.
You don't belong in this business.

1561
01:25:27,447 --> 01:25:29,741
You might listen to me.
One day you could say,

1562
01:25:29,782 --> 01:25:31,492
"Hey, maybe the guy -"
oh, fuck it.

1563
01:25:31,576 --> 01:25:34,579
Listen to me now.
Your partner depends on you.

1564
01:25:34,621 --> 01:25:37,206
The man who is your partner,
depends on you.

1565
01:25:37,290 --> 01:25:40,251
You go with him
and for him or you're shit!

1566
01:25:40,293 --> 01:25:42,545
You are shit -
you can't exist alone.

1567
01:25:42,629 --> 01:25:44,464
- Excuse me.
- "Excuse you," nothing!

1568
01:25:44,505 --> 01:25:47,634
You be as cold as you want.
You just fucked a good man

1569
01:25:47,717 --> 01:25:49,761
out of $6,000
and his goddamned bonus

1570
01:25:49,844 --> 01:25:51,929
because you didn't
know the shot.

1571
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:54,307
You can do that and you're not
man enough to say it gets you?

1572
01:25:54,349 --> 01:25:57,310
I don't know what -
if you can't take something from that,

1573
01:25:57,393 --> 01:26:00,229
then you're - scum!
You're fucking white bread.

1574
01:26:00,313 --> 01:26:03,316
A child would know it,
he's right.

1575
01:26:03,399 --> 01:26:06,611
If you're gonna make something up,
be sure that it helps.

1576
01:26:06,653 --> 01:26:09,656
Hmm?
Or keep your mouth shut.

1577
01:26:09,697 --> 01:26:12,492
I'm done with you.

1578
01:26:25,046 --> 01:26:26,631
How do you know
I made it up?

1579
01:26:26,714 --> 01:26:29,050
What?

1580
01:26:29,133 --> 01:26:32,053
How do you know
I made it up?

1581
01:26:32,136 --> 01:26:34,639
What are you
talking about, huh?

1582
01:26:37,308 --> 01:26:40,353
You said, "Don't make something up
unless it's sure to help."

1583
01:26:42,397 --> 01:26:47,026
- How did you know I made it up?
- What are you talking about?

1584
01:26:54,325 --> 01:26:57,078
I told the customer his contract
had gone to the bank.

1585
01:26:57,161 --> 01:26:59,372
Yeah. Well, hadn't it?

1586
01:27:03,084 --> 01:27:05,044
No, it hadn't.

1587
01:27:07,630 --> 01:27:09,299
Don't fuck with me.

1588
01:27:09,382 --> 01:27:11,801
Don't fuck with me!
What are you getting at?

1589
01:27:11,884 --> 01:27:14,637
I'm saying this, Shelly...

1590
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:19,809
usually I take
the contracts to the bank,

1591
01:27:19,892 --> 01:27:22,145
last night I didn't.

1592
01:27:23,563 --> 01:27:26,691
Last night I stayed home
with my kids.

1593
01:27:28,693 --> 01:27:31,070
How did you know that?

1594
01:27:33,072 --> 01:27:37,910
One night in a year,
I left a contract on my desk.

1595
01:27:37,994 --> 01:27:40,413
No one knew that but you.

1596
01:27:41,706 --> 01:27:43,458
Now, how did you know that?

1597
01:27:43,541 --> 01:27:47,128
You want to talk to me or you
want to talk to someone else?

1598
01:27:47,211 --> 01:27:48,671
Because this is my job!

1599
01:27:48,755 --> 01:27:52,592
This is my job on the line
and you are gonna talk to me!

1600
01:27:52,675 --> 01:27:55,678
Now how did you know
that contract was on my desk?

1601
01:27:55,762 --> 01:27:58,306
You are so full of shit!

1602
01:27:58,389 --> 01:28:00,725
- You robbed the office.
- Oh, sure, I robbed the office.

1603
01:28:00,767 --> 01:28:02,894
Oh sure! You asshole.

1604
01:28:02,977 --> 01:28:04,812
What did you do
with the leads?

1605
01:28:04,896 --> 01:28:07,607
You wanna go in there?
I tell him what I know,

1606
01:28:07,649 --> 01:28:10,318
he's gonna dig up something.
You got an alibi last night?

1607
01:28:10,401 --> 01:28:13,780
You better have one!
What did you do with the leads?

1608
01:28:13,863 --> 01:28:17,033
If you tell me what you did
with the leads, we can talk.

1609
01:28:17,116 --> 01:28:19,452
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

1610
01:28:19,494 --> 01:28:21,871
If you tell me where the leads are,
I won't turn you in.

1611
01:28:21,955 --> 01:28:24,332
If you don't, I'm gonna tell
the cop you stole them.

1612
01:28:24,415 --> 01:28:27,543
Mitch and Murray will see that you
go to jail, believe me, they will!

1613
01:28:27,627 --> 01:28:29,045
Now, where are the leads?

1614
01:28:29,128 --> 01:28:31,172
I'm walking in that door.
You got five seconds

1615
01:28:31,255 --> 01:28:32,882
- or you are going to jail!
- Go ahead.

1616
01:28:32,966 --> 01:28:35,426
I don't care,
you understand?

1617
01:28:36,636 --> 01:28:39,180
Where are the leads?

1618
01:28:40,598 --> 01:28:42,684
All right.

1619
01:28:44,644 --> 01:28:46,604
I sold them.

1620
01:28:55,571 --> 01:28:58,074
To Jerry Graff.

1621
01:28:58,157 --> 01:29:00,451
How much did you
get for them?

1622
01:29:00,493 --> 01:29:02,370
How much did
you get for them?

1623
01:29:02,453 --> 01:29:04,789
Five.
Five grand.

1624
01:29:04,831 --> 01:29:07,709
- I got half.
- Who got the other half?

1625
01:29:07,792 --> 01:29:09,794
Do I have to tell you?

1626
01:29:09,836 --> 01:29:12,380
Moss.

1627
01:29:16,009 --> 01:29:18,052
Well, that was easy,
wasn't it?

1628
01:29:18,136 --> 01:29:20,638
- His idea.
- Was it?

1629
01:29:20,722 --> 01:29:22,974
I think he got
more than five, actually.

1630
01:29:23,016 --> 01:29:26,352
- Uh-huh.
- He told me my cut was 2500.

1631
01:29:26,394 --> 01:29:28,646
Mmm.

1632
01:29:30,189 --> 01:29:31,858
Wait a minute.
Okay - hey, hey, John!

1633
01:29:31,899 --> 01:29:35,111
Wait - okay, John!
Hey, Johnny.

1634
01:29:35,194 --> 01:29:38,698
Listen.
Come here, come here.

1635
01:29:40,867 --> 01:29:42,619
Eh, John?

1636
01:29:42,702 --> 01:29:44,954
Last night...

1637
01:29:45,038 --> 01:29:47,707
I gotta tell you,
I'm ready to "do the Dutch."

1638
01:29:47,749 --> 01:29:50,710
I'm done. Moss gets me,
"Do this, we'll get well."

1639
01:29:50,752 --> 01:29:54,047
Why not? Big fucking deal.
I'm halfway hoping to get caught.

1640
01:29:54,130 --> 01:29:58,259
Hey - put me out of my misery.
It taught me something, John.

1641
01:29:58,343 --> 01:30:00,803
What it taught me -
you gotta get out there!

1642
01:30:00,887 --> 01:30:04,223
I'm not cut out to be a thief,
I'm cut out to be a salesman.

1643
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:07,101
And I am back.
I got my balls back.

1644
01:30:07,185 --> 01:30:11,147
Now... you got a slight
advantage on me.

1645
01:30:11,230 --> 01:30:13,816
But whatever it takes, John,

1646
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:16,402
to make things right,
we're gonna make it right.

1647
01:30:16,486 --> 01:30:19,072
We are going
to make it right.

1648
01:30:22,492 --> 01:30:24,285
I want to tell you
something, Shelly.

1649
01:30:24,369 --> 01:30:28,039
- Eh?
- You have a big mouth.

1650
01:30:28,081 --> 01:30:30,625
What?

1651
01:30:30,708 --> 01:30:32,418
You've got a big mouth!

1652
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:35,213
And now I'm gonna show you
an even bigger one.

1653
01:30:35,254 --> 01:30:37,131
Where are you going?

1654
01:30:37,215 --> 01:30:39,926
You can't do that!
You don't want to do that.

1655
01:30:40,009 --> 01:30:42,261
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1656
01:30:44,013 --> 01:30:47,517
It's $2,500. Go ahead
and take it, take it all.

1657
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,936
No, I don't think so.
I don't think I want your money.

1658
01:30:50,019 --> 01:30:52,939
I think you fucked up my office,
and I think you're going away.

1659
01:30:52,981 --> 01:30:56,943
Are you nuts?
I'm gonna close for you! Take -

1660
01:30:56,985 --> 01:31:00,446
I'm gonna make this office and be
number one on that board again.

1661
01:31:00,488 --> 01:31:02,782
Wait, John.

1662
01:31:02,865 --> 01:31:06,369
John - okay.

1663
01:31:09,163 --> 01:31:13,584
This is what
we're gonna do - 20%%.

1664
01:31:13,626 --> 01:31:16,838
I'm gonna give you 20%%
of all my sales.

1665
01:31:16,921 --> 01:31:19,841
20%%, as long as I'm
with this firm.

1666
01:31:19,924 --> 01:31:21,926
50.

1667
01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:26,472
- 50%%of all my sales.
- What sales?

1668
01:31:26,514 --> 01:31:28,683
What sales? My God,
I just closed 82 grand.

1669
01:31:28,766 --> 01:31:31,894
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I'm back! This is just the beginning!

1670
01:31:31,978 --> 01:31:34,439
Just the beginning?
Where have you been, Shelly?

1671
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:37,483
Bruce and Harriett Nyborg -
do you want to see the memos?

1672
01:31:37,525 --> 01:31:41,112
They're nuts.
They used to call in every week -

1673
01:31:41,195 --> 01:31:43,740
when I was with Webb -
we were selling Arizona.

1674
01:31:43,823 --> 01:31:45,867
They're nuts.

1675
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:51,331
Did you see how they were living?
How can you delude yourself?

1676
01:31:51,372 --> 01:31:53,333
- I've got their check.
- Forget it. Frame it.

1677
01:31:53,416 --> 01:31:55,627
- It's worthless.
- The check is no good?

1678
01:31:55,668 --> 01:31:58,046
You want to stick around?
I'll pull the memo. I'm busy.

1679
01:31:58,129 --> 01:32:00,006
The check is no good?
They're nuts?

1680
01:32:00,089 --> 01:32:01,924
You want to call the bank?
I called them.

1681
01:32:02,008 --> 01:32:05,678
I called them four months ago
when we first got the lead.

1682
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:08,514
The people are insane.

1683
01:32:09,974 --> 01:32:13,394
They just like talking
to salesmen.

1684
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:22,654
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

1685
01:32:25,239 --> 01:32:29,202
- Why?
- Because I don't like you.

1686
01:32:35,959 --> 01:32:37,961
My daughter.

1687
01:32:38,044 --> 01:32:40,213
Fuck you.

1688
01:32:55,395 --> 01:32:57,772
Asshole.

1689
01:32:57,855 --> 01:33:01,025
Guy couldn't find his fucking couch
in the living room.

1690
01:33:03,194 --> 01:33:05,571
What a day.

1691
01:33:05,655 --> 01:33:07,657
Whoo...

1692
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:10,201
I haven't even had
a cup of coffee.

1693
01:33:13,746 --> 01:33:17,417
Jag-off John opens his mouth,
blows my Cadillac.

1694
01:33:19,919 --> 01:33:23,506
I swear,
it's not a world of men.

1695
01:33:26,009 --> 01:33:28,720
It is not
a world of men, "Machine."

1696
01:33:28,761 --> 01:33:31,597
- Huh?
- It's a world of clock-watchers...

1697
01:33:31,639 --> 01:33:34,267
bureaucrats...

1698
01:33:34,350 --> 01:33:37,103
officeholders, what it is.

1699
01:33:38,146 --> 01:33:40,440
It's a fucked-up world.

1700
01:33:42,775 --> 01:33:44,777
No adventure to it.

1701
01:33:44,819 --> 01:33:49,115
Dying breed.
Yes, it is.

1702
01:33:50,783 --> 01:33:54,537
We're the members of a dying breed.
That's - that's -

1703
01:33:54,621 --> 01:33:58,374
that's why we got
to stick together. Shel?

1704
01:33:58,458 --> 01:34:00,793
- Huh?
- I want to talk to you.

1705
01:34:00,877 --> 01:34:03,171
I've wanted to talk to you
for some time -

1706
01:34:03,254 --> 01:34:07,133
for a long time, actually.
I said, "The Machine" -

1707
01:34:07,216 --> 01:34:10,637
there's a man
I would work with.

1708
01:34:10,678 --> 01:34:14,432
There's -" you know,
I never said a word.

1709
01:34:14,474 --> 01:34:17,435
I don't know why I didn't.
I should've, I don't know why.

1710
01:34:17,477 --> 01:34:21,314
And that shit you were slinging
on my guy today -

1711
01:34:21,397 --> 01:34:25,568
that was so good.
That - it -

1712
01:34:25,652 --> 01:34:28,446
excuse me for saying this,
it's not even my place to say it.

1713
01:34:28,488 --> 01:34:31,074
That was admirable.

1714
01:34:31,157 --> 01:34:33,826
It was the old stuff.

1715
01:34:33,868 --> 01:34:37,455
Hey, I've been
on a hot streak.

1716
01:34:37,497 --> 01:34:41,250
So what?
Things I can learn from you.

1717
01:34:43,336 --> 01:34:45,505
- You eat today?
- Me?

1718
01:34:45,588 --> 01:34:47,090
Yeah.

1719
01:34:47,173 --> 01:34:50,510
Want to swing around the Chinks' -
watch me eat, we'll talk?

1720
01:34:50,593 --> 01:34:52,929
I think
I'll stay around awhile.

1721
01:34:53,012 --> 01:34:54,973
Hello, Mrs. Schwartz?

1722
01:34:55,014 --> 01:34:57,141
This is Richard Roma
with Premiere Properties.

1723
01:34:57,183 --> 01:35:00,144
You or your accountant requested
information on a land investment

1724
01:35:00,186 --> 01:35:02,814
which would offer you
depreciation and the chance

1725
01:35:02,855 --> 01:35:05,108
of a substantial return
on a small investment.

1726
01:35:05,191 --> 01:35:07,610
I'm in from Florida
just for one day...

1727
01:35:07,694 --> 01:35:11,531
- Mr. Levene?
- ...so I only have that one lot left.

1728
01:35:11,572 --> 01:35:13,408
Would you come in here,
please?

1729
01:35:13,491 --> 01:35:15,868
I don't have too much time
and I'm on the midnight plane back,

1730
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:18,371
so if you or your husband
are truly interested -

1731
01:35:18,413 --> 01:35:20,873
because I can't hold
this parcel past -

1732
01:35:20,957 --> 01:35:23,459
Yes?

1733
01:35:23,543 --> 01:35:26,504
Well, what would be better
for you - say, 6:00 or 8:00?

1734
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:32,010
Go ask him. Shel - we're gonna talk?
I'm going to the Chinks'.

1735
01:35:32,093 --> 01:35:34,053
When you're done, come down.
We're gonna smoke a cigarette.

1736
01:35:34,095 --> 01:35:36,222
- I...
- Get in the room.

1737
01:35:36,306 --> 01:35:40,226
Hey. Hey, easy, pal.
That's "The Machine."

1738
01:35:40,268 --> 01:35:43,313
This is Shelly
"The Machine" Levene.

1739
01:35:43,396 --> 01:35:45,732
- Get in the goddamn room.
- Rick, I...

1740
01:35:45,815 --> 01:35:47,984
- I'll meet you at the restaurant.
- Ricky -

1741
01:35:48,067 --> 01:35:49,902
- Ricky can't help you.
- All I want is -

1742
01:35:49,986 --> 01:35:52,030
What do you want?
You want to what?

1743
01:35:52,113 --> 01:35:56,034
- Rick? Rick?
- Hello? Excellent.

1744
01:35:57,452 --> 01:36:02,290
8:00 p.m.
6$47 Euclid.

1745
01:36:02,373 --> 01:36:05,084
Not at all -
thank you very much.

1746
01:36:15,762 --> 01:36:19,015
They find the guy
that broke in the office?

1747
01:36:19,098 --> 01:36:22,268
No. I don't know.

1748
01:36:27,106 --> 01:36:29,192
Did the leads
come in yet?

1749
01:36:29,275 --> 01:36:31,736
No.

1750
01:36:39,619 --> 01:36:41,913
Oh God,
I hate this job.

1751
01:36:41,955 --> 01:36:44,082
Anybody wants me,
I'm at the restaurant.

1752
01:36:49,629 --> 01:36:52,465
Hello, Mrs. Delgari?

1753
01:36:52,507 --> 01:36:55,760
Yes - you requested some information
about Rio Rancho Properties?
