1
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,920
2306.

2
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,710
Hello, honey.
How you doing?

3
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,680
Good.
What did he say?

4
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,300
Uh-huh. Is he still there?
How long ago did he leave?

5
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,270
Uh-huh. I'm stopping here,
then I got a little meeting,

6
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,980
and then I'll--
I would if I could.

7
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,230
As soon as I can.
Let me get off and I--

8
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,530
let me get off and I prom--
I promise you it'll be okay.

9
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,370
A bunch of bullshit.
Waste a good man's time.

10
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,630
Hi, could I speak
to Dr. Lowenstein, please?

11
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,340
It's rather important.
Could you get him for me?

12
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,130
Bunch of bullshit trying to make
a living on these deadbeat leads.

13
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,630
I swear to God, Shel,
I'm on a sit today--

14
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,890
Hello, Mrs. Swoboda,
this is Dave Moss.

15
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,970
Yeah, we spoke yesterday.

16
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,850
Now on the Rio Rancho Estates,
we've had a situation just come up.

17
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,480
The president of our company
is in town just one day,

18
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,860
- and he has certain parcels--
- Doctor--

19
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,990
well, could you get--
what do you mean?

20
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,740
He's not there?
I have to speak to him.

21
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,780
Yes, it is fairly urgent.
Mr. Levene.

22
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:59,080
No, I can't be reached.
I'll get back to him.

23
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,370
He has certain parcels--
certain choice parcels

24
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,920
which he's given me
a hold on for the next 48 hours.

25
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What would be the best time to get
you and your husband together?

26
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,050
Say, tonight, at 10:00,
or tomorrow at 8:00?

27
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,600
Okay.

28
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,310
Okay, what would be
the best time to do that?

29
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,650
Look, you sent in the--
no, no, listen to me now--

30
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,480
I've got 48 hours
to make you a lot of money.

31
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,200
Well, when will he be home?
Fine, I'll call you back in 10 minutes.

32
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,410
They don't give you the leads,
they don't give you the support,

33
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,330
- they don't give you dick.
- Yeah.

34
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,370
Then they're yanking us in
on some sales conference.

35
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,540
When's the last time anybody
learned a goddamn thing?

36
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,000
All it does is some jerk
shoots his mouth off.

37
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,090
I swear to God, Shel, I got half a mind
to go across the street.

38
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,680
I got half a mind to go
with you if they'd take me.

39
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,930
You never know-- I was talking
to Jerry Graff last week.

40
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,140
I got to call
these deadbeats back.

41
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,440
I can't make a goddamn
dollar with these leads,

42
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,360
and you're killing my ass
on the street.

43
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,730
- I'm sorry you aren't happy here.
- That's cute,

44
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,320
but you're running this office
like a bunch of bullshit.

45
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,530
You're on an override--
you make money, we make money.

46
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,620
- I'd like you to make more money.
- Then don't go waste my time.

47
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,370
- A sales conference?
- The strategy comes from downtown.

48
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,700
Oh, the strategy?
The strategy?

49
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,830
- Well, I think I'll pass.
- I wouldn't.

50
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,750
- Why is that?
- When you come, then you'll see.

51
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,880
- Shelly.
- John.

52
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,010
Are you ready
to do or die tonight?

53
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,010
Oh yeah,
always ready, John.

54
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,430
Always ready, John.
Now, one thing--

55
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,430
we were talking about the leads.
We got some new ones?

56
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,760
That's what we're going
to talk about at the meeting.

57
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,270
We are? Because I'm running
into a bit of a snag.

58
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,140
Yes, I've seen
your sales figures.

59
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,270
That's the leads.
You give me a better lead--

60
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,360
That's what we're going
to be talking about.

61
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,280
I'm in a bind--
personal problems.

62
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,150
- I could use a leg up.
- After the meeting.

63
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,360
- I hear the new Glengarry leads--
- After the meeting, Shel.

64
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,370
- Hey, Ricky.
- Hello, John.

65
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,990
- Wet out there tonight.
- Huh?

66
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,580
- Wet out there tonight.
- Uh-huh.

67
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,790
- Maybe it'll break the heat.
- Yeah.

68
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,630
Al, give me a quick J&B, huh?
Double.

69
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,470
Cutty, Al.

70
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,060
- They say...
- Huh?

71
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,890
they say it was so hot
downtown this afternoon,

72
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,480
grown men on the street corner
were going up to cops

73
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,230
begging the cops
to shoot them.

74
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,110
They say you should not drink
alcohol when it's so hot.

75
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,490
- Who says that?
- Something I read.

76
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,910
For they say
it dehydrates you.

77
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,830
They say
you should drink water,

78
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,050
but I subscribe to the law
of contrary public opinion.

79
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,510
If everyone thinks one thing,
then I say bet the other way.

80
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Added to which,
you know they're wrong.

81
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,220
That's what I'm saying.

82
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,850
- Slow tonight.
- Oh, yeah.

83
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,020
Well, I guess
everybody's staying home.

84
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,400
If my daughter calls,
anybody calls,

85
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,030
I'm over at the office.
Thanks.

86
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,440
I had a woman
in White Plains on the hook--

87
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,480
five units, Mountain View--
what happens?

88
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,360
She has to check
with her lawyer.

89
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,990
- You let her check with her lawyer?
- What could I do?

90
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,620
- I dunno.
- Shelly.

91
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,780
- Huh?
- Who's the guy?

92
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,790
Couldn't tell you.

93
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,580
I don't like the whole thing,
because all I need is a lead.

94
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,330
- They won't give out--
- Uh-huh.

95
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,000
The rich get richer,
that's the law of the land.

96
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,300
Who belongs
to the BM--?

97
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,390
It is 7:30.

98
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,600
So who is that?

99
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,600
And where is
Mr. Roma?

100
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,350
Well, I'm not a leash,
so I don't know, do I?

101
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,480
Let me have
your attention for a moment.

102
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,780
You're talking about what?
You're talking about--

103
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,200
bitching about
that sale you shot,

104
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,490
some son of a bitch
don't want to buy land,

105
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,910
somebody don't want
what you're selling,

106
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,910
some broad you're
trying to screw, so forth.

107
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,040
Let's talk
about something important.

108
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,790
- Are they all here?
- All but one.

109
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,790
I'm going anyway.

110
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,380
Let's talk
about something important.

111
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,840
Put that coffee down.

112
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,430
Coffee's for closers only.

113
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,310
You think
I'm fucking with you?

114
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,650
I am not fucking with you.

115
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,530
I'm here from downtown.

116
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,150
I'm here
from Mitch and Murray.

117
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,370
And I'm here
on a mission of mercy.

118
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,750
- Your name's Levene?
- Yeah.

119
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,630
You call yourself a salesman,
you son of a bitch?

120
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,420
I don't got to listen
to this shit.

121
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,760
You certainly don't, 'cause
the good news is, you're fired.

122
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,300
The bad news is you've got--
all of you've got--

123
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,430
just one week
to regain your jobs,

124
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,980
starting with tonight--
starting with tonight's sit.

125
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,860
Oh, have I got
your attention now?

126
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,740
Good...

127
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,900
'cause we're adding
a little something

128
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,620
to this month's
sales contest.

129
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,780
As you all know, first prize
is a Cadillac Eldorado.

130
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,870
Anybody want to see
second prize?

131
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,370
Second prize is
a set of steak knives.

132
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,300
Third prize is you're fired.

133
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,680
Do you get the picture?
Are you laughing now?

134
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,180
You got leads. Mitch and Murray
paid good money.

135
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,390
Get their names
to sell them.

136
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,480
You can't close
the leads you're given,

137
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,230
you can't close shit,
you are shit!

138
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,820
Hit the bricks, pal, and beat it,
'cause you are going out!

139
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,360
- The leads are weak.
- The leads are weak?

140
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,200
The fucking leads are weak?
You're weak.

141
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
I've been
in this business 15 years.

142
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,620
- What's your name?
- Fuck you--

143
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,210
that's my name!
You know why, mister?

144
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,380
Because you drove a Hyundai
to get here tonight,

145
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:04,380
I drove an $80,000 BMW.
That's my name.

146
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,680
And your name
is "You're wanting."

147
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,930
You can't play in the man's game?
You can't close them?

148
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,390
Then go home and tell your wife
your troubles.

149
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,150
Because only one thing
counts in this life--

150
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,650
get them to sign
on the line which is dotted!

151
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,610
You hear me,
you fucking faggots?

152
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,290
"A-B-C."

153
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,330
A-- Always,
B-- Be, C-- Closing.

154
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,380
Always Be Closing.

155
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,130
"Always Be Closing."

156
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,840
"A-I-D-A."

157
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,600
"Attention, Interest,
Decision, Action."

158
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,140
Attention--
Do I have your attention?

159
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,350
Interest--
Are you interested?

160
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,730
I know you are,
because it's fuck or walk.

161
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,770
You close
or you hit the bricks.

162
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:06,070
Decision-- Have you made
your decision for Christ?

163
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,860
And Action.
"A-I-D-A."

164
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,200
Get out there--
you got the prospects coming in.

165
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,450
You think they came in
to get out of the rain?

166
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,910
A guy don't walk on the lot
lest he wants to buy.

167
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:21,290
They're sitting out there
waiting to give you their money.

168
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,380
Are you gonna take it?

169
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,590
Are you man enough
to take it?

170
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,010
Crap.

171
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,970
What's the problem, pal?
You-- Moss.

172
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:39,520
You're such a hero,
you're so rich,

173
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,900
how come you're here wasting
your time with a bunch of bums?

174
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,480
You see this watch?

175
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:53,910
- You see this watch?
- Yeah.

176
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,200
That watch costs
more than your car.

177
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,290
I made $70,000 last year.
How much you make?

178
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:08,710
You see, pal... that's who I am,
and you're nothing.

179
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,680
Nice guy?
I don't give a shit.

180
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,720
Good father? Fuck you--
go home and play with your kids.

181
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,270
You want to work here--
close!

182
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,650
You think this is abuse?

183
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,810
You think this is abuse,
you cocksucker?

184
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:30,530
You can't take this, how can you
take the abuse you get on a sit?

185
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:35,110
You don't like it, leave.

186
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:40,450
I can go out there tonight--
the materials you got--

187
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,620
make myself $15,000.
Tonight-- in two hours!

188
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,540
Can you?

189
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,300
Can you?

190
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,260
Go and do likewise.
"A-I-D-A."

191
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,970
Get mad, you son of a bitches.
Get mad!

192
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,970
You know what it takes
to sell real estate?

193
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,690
It takes brass balls
to sell real estate.

194
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,030
Go and do likewise,
gents.

195
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,570
The money's out there--
you pick it up, it's yours,

196
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,870
you don't,
I got no sympathy for you.

197
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,780
You want to go out
on those sits tonight and close--

198
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,580
close-- it's yours.

199
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,870
Not, you're gonna be
shining my shoes.

200
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,620
And you know
what you'll be saying.

201
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,340
Bunch of losers
sitting around in a bar,

202
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,590
"Oh yeah, I used to be a salesman.
It's a tough racket."

203
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,680
These are the new leads.

204
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,810
These are
the Glengarry leads.

205
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,610
And to you, they're gold.
And you don't get them.

206
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,400
Why?

207
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,490
Because to give them to you
is just throwing them away.

208
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,960
They're for closers.

209
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,250
I'd wish you good luck,

210
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,550
but you wouldn't know what
to do with it if you got it.

211
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:24,720
And to answer your question, pal--
"Why am I here?"

212
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,810
I came here because
Mitch and Murray asked me to.

213
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,560
They asked me for a favor.
I said, "The real favor--

214
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,650
follow my advice
and fire your fucking ass,

215
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,240
because a loser
is a loser."

216
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,830
Bunch of fucking nonsense--

217
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,580
treat people like that.

218
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,300
The fuck is he going
to get off?

219
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,760
- Mickey Mouse sales conference.
- He didn't mean it.

220
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,680
I'm sure he didn't mean it about
trimming down the sales quota.

221
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,970
Where is Roma?
Where the hell is Mr. Ricky Roma?

222
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,430
All the while we got to sit here,
eat this nonsense?

223
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,600
Hello? Mr. Levene.
How's she doing?

224
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,650
Uh-huh, yeah.
Is she awake?

225
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,280
Oh, the doctor came by.
What did he say?

226
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,900
Uh-huh.
I can't come in tonight.

227
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,740
I think-- I know she is.
I know that she is.

228
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,660
I've gotta go out. Will you please
tell her when she wakes?

229
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,710
I've got to go out.
Tell her I'll call her from the road.

230
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,370
Thank you.

231
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,800
Gentlemen,
you heard the man.

232
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,630
What is this in aid of?

233
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,800
- As of tonight--
- What is this? Excuse me.

234
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,050
What it's in aid of
is that Mitch and Murray--

235
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,890
Fuck Mitch and Murray!
I'm doing my job,

236
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,770
I got to put up
with this childishness?

237
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,680
I don't make the rules.
I'm paid to run the office.

238
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:53,100
You don't like the rules, Dave?
There's the door!

239
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:59,610
Two lead cards for tonight,
two lead cards for tomorrow.

240
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,400
As you heard,
end of the month,

241
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,610
top salesman on the board
gets the Eldorado.

242
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,780
- Next man down the--
- What about the good leads?

243
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,240
- The leads I've given you.
- But these leads are shit.

244
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,200
They're old--
I've seen that name 100 times.

245
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,330
- The leads are assigned randomly.
- What about the new leads?

246
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,210
The new leads--
the Glengarry leads.

247
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,630
I've got them.
I'm going to hang onto them.

248
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,800
And they'll be
assigned to closers,

249
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,220
based on the sales volume,
first to Roma.

250
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,220
- Where is Roma?
- Don't worry about Roma.

251
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,930
He'll get his leads,
you've got yours.

252
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,140
He's top name on the board,
so he don't have to be here?

253
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,680
That's correct!
And as the hour is waning,

254
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,640
I suggest you-- those of you
who are interested

255
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,520
in a continuing job with
this organization, get to work.

256
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,570
That's garbage.
Bullshit.

257
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,360
- Thank you for your attention.
- Bullshit!

258
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,530
How am I supposed to close these?
Look at this.

259
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,570
I've had this guy before.
I've been to his house twice.

260
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,370
I-- I can't--
I can't close this stuff.

261
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,130
Shelly, how am I
supposed to--

262
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,880
They're going
to bounce me out of a job.

263
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,470
Hello, Mr. Palermo?
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,980
Mr. Speice?
Mr. Robert Speice?

265
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,980
Yeah,
this is George Aaronow.

266
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,150
I'm with Rio.
I spoke with your wife earlier.

267
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,740
I'm the vice president of Rio Rancho
Properties in Furman, Arizona.

268
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:30,030
Yes. I'm calling from the airport,
and consulting my map,

269
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,330
I see that you and your wife
live near the airport.

270
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,460
I have some rather--
rather unusual,

271
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,750
rather good information
on the property...

272
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:42,210
Hello? Hello, this is
Sheldon Levene.

273
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,630
Please listen closely--
I only have a moment or so.

274
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:48,300
I can speak only
to a Mrs. Nyborg.

275
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,310
Oh, this is Mrs. Nyborg.
Please listen closely, Mrs. Nyborg.

276
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:56,100
I'm calling from Consolidated
Properties of Arizona.

277
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,900
Our computer has chosen you
from all of the many thousands

278
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,820
who write in requesting
information on our properties.

279
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,900
Now by federal law,
as you probably know,

280
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,110
the prize must be awarded to you
even if you are not engaged

281
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,200
in our land
development plan.

282
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,910
The only stipulation, of course,
is that you and your husband

283
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,120
must sign at the same time
for the receipt of your prize.

284
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:22,630
Now, I will be in the area
tonight, possibly tomorrow.

285
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,260
What do you think might be
a convenient time to meet

286
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,510
with both you
and your husband?

287
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,140
Of course I'll hold.

288
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,990
- Bunch of fucking nonsense, huh?
- I can't close them.

289
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,570
- Nobody can close 'em.
- They're old.

290
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,860
They're ancient--
a bunch of fucking nonsense.

291
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,240
Get some jerk
to come in here--

292
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,120
Sometimes I think,
"I wonder if I belong in this business."

293
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,580
Send a guy out there--
no support, no confidence.

294
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,290
Then I say,
"Nobody can close 'em."

295
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,880
- Then I look at Roma.
- Roma-- fuck Roma.

296
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,050
Had a freak--
a little run of luck.

297
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,550
The leads are garbage.

298
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,720
Then I say,
"Why give him the good leads?

299
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,890
- He doesn't need 'em."
- You going out?

300
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:16,560
Yeah. I have to go out.
I can't make a sit.

301
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,560
- Have you tried?
- Yeah. Something's wrong with me.

302
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,610
What is it?
I can't push through.

303
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,900
Get your coat on.
You're coming out with me.

304
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,070
- Something in me.
- Forget it.

305
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:30,200
- I try, I try.
- I said forget it, come on.

306
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,570
I can't close 'em.

307
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,790
Life.

308
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,080
I swear to God,
you work all your life--

309
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,290
- Forget it, George.
- Roma, so on...

310
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,750
- so gifted.
- Gifted, my ass!

311
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,380
- The guy gets a string of luck.
- No, no, no.

312
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,180
The thing of it is,
money's tight.

313
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,090
When times are tight,
it don't do no good

314
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,510
to throw around,
"Just go out and sell."

315
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,310
Threaten a man all you want,
you can't whip a dead horse.

316
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,940
- Nope.
- All this garbage--

317
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,480
"Sell 10,000,
you win a Cadillac;

318
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,810
you lose, we're gonna fire
your ass"? It's medieval.

319
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,070
- Yes.
- It's wrong.

320
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,610
- Yes.
- Yes it is,

321
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,240
and you know
who's responsible?

322
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,280
- Who?
- You know who it is.

323
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
It's Mitch and Murray,
'cause it don't have to be this way.

324
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,330
- No.
- Look at Jerry Graff.

325
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,410
He's clean, he's doing
business for himself,

326
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,620
he's got that list--
with the nurses?

327
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:25,130
You see? That's thinking.
Why take a 10% sales commission?

328
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,420
Why are we giving the rest away?
What are we giving 90% for?

329
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,380
For nothing.
For some jerk in the office,

330
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,800
telling us, "Get out there and close,
go win a Cadillac."

331
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,510
Graff goes out and buys.
He pays top dollar.

332
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,970
- You see?
- Yes.

333
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,020
For the leads-- that's thinking.
Now, he's got the leads,

334
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:45,270
he goes in business for himself.
That's what? That's thinking.

335
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,310
Who-- who's got
a steady job,

336
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,530
a regular job,
a couple of bucks nobody's touched?

337
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,110
Nurses.

338
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,820
Graff goes and buys
a fucking list of nurses. One grand--

339
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,240
he paid two, I'll eat my hat.
4,000 or 5,000 nurses.

340
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,660
- He's going wild.
- He is?

341
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,950
- Yeah, he's doing very well.
- I heard they were running cold.

342
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,830
- The nurses?
- Yeah.

343
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:06,130
You hear a lot of things.
He's doing very well.

344
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,000
- With River Oaks?
- River Oaks, Brook Farms.

345
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:10,840
All that shit. Somebody told me--
you know what he's clearing, himself?

346
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,630
- 14, 15 grand a week.
- Himself?

347
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:17,050
That's what I'm saying.
Why? He's got the leads.

348
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:20,260
He's got the good leads.
What are we?

349
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,060
We're sitting
in the shit here. Why?

350
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,980
Because we got to go to them
to get them.

351
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,980
90% of our sales we're paying
to the office for the leads.

352
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,440
There's our leads, there's overhead,
phones, a lot of stuff.

353
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,480
What do you need?
A telephone?

354
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:35,700
Some broad to say, "Good morning"?
Nothing. It's the leads.

355
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,370
The whole thing is the leads,
you understand me?

356
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:41,290
You can't sell to a void--
you got to get a goddamn person.

357
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,870
You get a lead, you get
a person-- I'll go sell 'em.

358
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,750
Otherwise, what do they want
from my life?

359
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:49,880
Hello, Danny?
Dan, it's Shel Levene.

360
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,960
Yeah, we spoke--
last May I called you.

361
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:56,220
I was in town from my estate
in Rio Rancho, and--

362
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,010
Arizona.

363
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,350
I wish we could have
gotten together at that time.

364
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:04,180
Danny, that piece of property I had
for you has increased in value--

365
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:09,480
Grace, Grace,
what was that figure? $76,000.

366
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,980
Oh, Danny, I wish you could have
been in on it with me.

367
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,650
Look, I'm here overnight--
I have to go home tomorrow,

368
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:18,610
and I thought, after the interest
you showed on the last trip, that--

369
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:22,530
Hold it, Grace. Danny,
I know that you're serious,

370
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,660
and because of that, I am going
to shove my appointments around

371
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:29,790
and make sure--
oh, gee, I wish that--

372
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:34,840
All right, Danny.
Yeah, all right.

373
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:48,690
Going out tonight,
Shelly?

374
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,530
What is this bullshit
with the sales promotion?

375
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,110
It isn't bullshit.
It's the way it is.

376
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,240
You're going to fire
the bottom men on the list?

377
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,740
That's the way it is
and I don't make the rules.

378
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,120
- The rules come from downtown.
- I got a problem here, John.

379
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,700
- I'm closing up the office.
- Come have a drink with me.

380
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,040
- I've got to get home.
- Do me the courtesy-- five minutes?

381
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,250
I am trying to get home
for two hours.

382
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:15,340
I got to go home, grab one hour
with my kids, come back here,

383
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,880
see if any of you closed
a contract, take the contract--

384
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,550
- How about one minute?
- What is it?

385
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,640
- I can't close these leads.
- Then move on.

386
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,600
Don't jump! Don't jump out
of your manager bag a second.

387
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,900
It's just two guys talking,
am I right? We're just talking.

388
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,570
You got the new leads.
If you would give me-- just hold on.

389
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,440
The Glengarry leads are to be
assigned only to closers.

390
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,280
Hold on a second.
If you give me the good leads--

391
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,910
You blew the last good one
I gave you.

392
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,660
No, no-- hold on,
will you?

393
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,330
I did not blow 'em.
One kicked out. One, I closed.

394
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,290
- You didn't close it.
- Would you listen to me?

395
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:52,170
I closed that cocksucker!
His ex! John, his ex!

396
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,750
I didn't even know he was married.
The judge invalidated it.

397
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,750
Shelly--

398
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:58,300
What was that job, huh?
Bad luck. That's all it was.

399
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,590
I pray you never find it--
it runs in streaks.

400
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:03,590
That's what it's doing,
that's all it does-- streaks.

401
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:07,220
I pray that it misses you
and that's all I have to say.

402
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,310
Shit, I've got to eat.
Williamson--

403
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:14,480
look at the sheets.
Look at the sheets.

404
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,280
1987, '88, '89--
six months in '89-- who's on top?

405
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,820
- Roma.
- Under him?

406
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,610
- Moss.
- Oh, bullshit, John!

407
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,280
April to September it's me--
it's no fucking Moss.

408
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,700
Due respect,
he's an order-taker.

409
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:31,500
Talk-- talks a good game,
but look on the board, it's me.

410
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,710
- Not lately it isn't.
- Not late--

411
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,210
Well, lately--
kiss my ass "lately."

412
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,920
You call Murray and you call Mitch--
when we were on Peterson,

413
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,630
who do you think bought the new car?
Call Mitch. The Seville?

414
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:44,800
He came in here--
"You bought that for me, fella."

415
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:48,810
And out of what? Hey, look at me!
Out of what? Nothing!

416
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,100
Cold calling.
You want to talk about a sale?

417
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,690
You are really
beginning to burn my ass, kid.

418
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:58,110
I can't get a lead, you--
it was skill, John.

419
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,650
It could be working for you--
you want to throw it away.

420
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,950
- It isn't me.
- It's not you--

421
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,530
I wonder who it is.
Who the fuck am I talking to?

422
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:09,330
- I need the leads to sell.
- After the contest. After the 30th.

423
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,660
Bullshit,
"After the contest."

424
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,420
If I'm not on that board by the 30th,
they're going to can my ass.

425
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,260
I need those leads
and I need 'em now or I'm out.

426
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:32,140
You're going to miss me.
I swear to you, you will miss me.

427
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,980
Let me tell you
something, Shelly.

428
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,060
I do what I'm hired to do--
you might do the same.

429
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,020
- Jesus.
- Now wait a second!

430
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:44,570
I'm hired to watch the leads,
to marshal my sales force.

431
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,740
I'm given a policy.
My job is to do that.

432
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,870
Marshal your sales force?

433
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,620
Anybody falls below
a certain mark, I'm directed.

434
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,660
I'm not permitted
to give them the premium leads.

435
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,670
How do they rise
above that mark? With dreck?

436
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,040
With this toilet paper
you're giving me?

437
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,750
You give me
one premium lead--

438
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,510
Do you know what
the premium leads cost?

439
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,880
Do I know what
the premium leads cost?

440
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,340
Yeah,
I know what they cost.

441
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,640
I generated the sufficient
dollar revenue to buy them.

442
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,680
But I cannot sell shit!

443
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,350
Jesus. And I've seen
these before, you know.

444
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,350
Christ, I saw these back--
Homestead--

445
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,770
1985, we pitched
these cocksuckers Baywater.

446
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:25,110
They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.
They're broke. They're deadbeats.

447
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:28,110
Just give me some leads that don't
come out of a phone book.

448
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,910
You give me something hotter
than that and I can close it.

449
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,200
It's just a streak.
I'm gonna turn it around.

450
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,540
Hey, I need your help.

451
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,500
I can't do it,
Shelly.

452
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,090
John...

453
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:51,800
I'll give you 10%.

454
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,430
- Of what?
- My end-- what I close.

455
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:57,430
You give me the premium leads,
you're in for 10%, what I close.

456
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,350
- And what if you don't close?
- I will.

457
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,440
- What if you don't close?
- I will close.

458
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,610
What if you don't,
you understand?

459
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,610
Then I'm fucked. You think you're
the only guy with a family?

460
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,400
- You see what I'm saying?
- John--

461
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,740
I step out and you don't close,
then it's my job.

462
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,830
- Then I'm fucked.
- I will close!

463
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,580
Now, 10%John--
I can get hot, you know that.

464
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,250
- Not lately you can't.
- That's defeatist-- fuck it!

465
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,250
Go with me. Get on my side
and let's do something.

466
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,960
You want to run this office?
You heard what the man said--

467
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,460
"Attack."
Let's do something.

468
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:30,970
- Huh?
- 20%.

469
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,970
- All right.
- And 50 bucks a lead.

470
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:37,020
- No?
- Oh!

471
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,650
Oh, shit.

472
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,380
Listen...
I got to talk to you.

473
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:08,340
Permit me to do this a second.
I'm older than you.

474
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,760
A man acquires a reputation
on the street.

475
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,510
What he does when he's up,
what he does at other times...

476
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:17,810
I said, "10," you said, "No."
You said, "20," I said, "Fine."

477
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:21,310
Now you want to throw
this 50-buck thing in.

478
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:26,190
John, a good deal-- has got to be
one where both parties--

479
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:29,490
Okay, okay, okay, fine--
20%, 50 bucks a lead. It's done.

480
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,490
Let's go out.
We make some money.

481
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:34,200
I got bills to pay.
I want two sits tonight

482
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,910
and I want the good leads--
the Glengarry leads-- two.

483
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,200
Two, John, because
I am going to close 'em both.

484
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,080
It's a long road
with no turning, pally.

485
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,000
Huh? Okay.
Now, let's go.

486
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,670
I've got to go back
to the office to get 'em.

487
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:51,630
Go on, let's go.
This is what I was saying, John.

488
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:54,390
All you need, a little boost,
you turn a streak around.

489
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:57,510
Am I right? Good, huh?
Huh, good?

490
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,020
What?

491
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,850
- What?
- Two leads, 100 bucks.

492
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:05,020
- Now?
- Now, yes. When?

493
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,360
- Shit, John.
- I wish I could.

494
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,110
You fucking asshole.

495
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,530
I don't have it--
I don't--

496
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,950
I'll bring it in the office
in the morning.

497
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:18,370
- I'll be coming with the sales.
- Nope.

498
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:23,540
I can't fucking
believe this.

499
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,960
All right, here's...

500
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,840
20... 30, and--

501
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,420
Jesus, here's the 30.
I'll bring the rest in tomorrow.

502
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,720
We got to do this, huh, pal?
For Christ's sake!

503
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,590
No.

504
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,600
- My daughter...
- I can't do it, Shelly.

505
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,770
I got to tell you something.
It wasn't so long ago,

506
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:49,690
I'd pick up the phone
and call Murray-- I got your job.

507
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:53,150
"Murray, the kid is burning my ass."
"Shelly, he's gone."

508
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,030
You are gone before
I'm back from lunch.

509
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,870
Bought him a trip
to Bermuda once.

510
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,740
- I've got to go.
- All right, hey.

511
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:06,330
Give me-- I'll take two more
of the old leads.

512
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:09,000
- I gave you two today.
- One is a bust-out, John!

513
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,050
- The other ain't home!
- Shelly--

514
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,300
I promise you,
I've been on the phone-- I know.

515
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,010
No more leads today--
two per day. You've got yours.

516
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,090
All right.

517
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,590
- All right?
- Sure.

518
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:28,270
We will do that...
other thing.

519
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,190
I guess I left
my wallet in my room.

520
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,330
Deadbeats.
Deadbeats, all of 'em.

521
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:46,120
My mistake.
I shouldn't have took the leads.

522
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,500
- You had to.
- Yeah? Why?

523
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,790
- To get on the--
- To get on the board, yeah.

524
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,960
How am I gonna get on the board
trying to sell a doctor?

525
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,800
Two regular,
two chocolate donuts.

526
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,930
Give me the same thing to go.
And don't try and sell an Indian.

527
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,680
I will never try to sell
an Indian.

528
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,010
These names come up--
you ever get 'em-- "Patel"?

529
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:05,100
- You ever get 'em?
- I think I had one once.

530
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,430
You had one,
you'd know it-- "Patel."

531
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,140
They keep coming up.
I don't know.

532
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,560
They like to talk to salesmen.
They're lonely.

533
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:14,360
They like to feel superior--
never bought a fucking thing.

534
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,030
I don't know.
Come down the line--

535
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:21,570
doctors, lawyers, Indians--
times are tight. It's tight.

536
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:26,160
Pressure's just too great.
Man can't work all of 'em.

537
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,960
You go in the door-- I got to close
this fucker or I don't eat lunch,

538
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,750
or I don't win a Cadillac.
We work too hard, George.

539
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:41,260
Remember when we were-- when we
were selling Glen Ross Farms?

540
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,550
Didn't we sell
a bunch of that?

541
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,850
- They came in--
- They fucked it up.

542
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,850
- They did.
- They killed the goose. And now...

543
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,270
- We're stuck with this--
- Stuck with this fucking shit.

544
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,940
- This shit.
- It's too...

545
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,270
- It is.
- You get a bad month--

546
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,780
they put you on this board.
Some contest board.

547
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,320
- It's not right.
- It's not right to the customers.

548
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,700
I know, it's-- hey. What did I learn
as a kid on Western?

549
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:08,750
Don't sell a guy one car.
Sell him five cars over 15 years.

550
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,580
- That's right.
- You're goddamn right, it's right.

551
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,580
Guys come in-- "Oh, the blah,
blah, blah. I know what I'll do.

552
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,090
I'll go out and rob everybody
blind and go to Argentina

553
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:18,010
'cause nobody ever
thought of this before."

554
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,930
So they kill the goose
and the man's worked all his life--

555
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,930
- That's right.
- He's got to cower in his boots--

556
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,050
Boots, yes...

557
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:27,470
For some fucking "Sell 10,000,
win the steak knives."

558
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,480
- What do you do?
- What can you do?

559
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,940
What can you do
if you don't have the leads?

560
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,770
If you do not
have the goddamn leads!

561
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,820
Mr. Spannel?
Sheldon Levene.

562
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,900
I was speaking
to your wife earlier?

563
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,900
Come in.

564
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,320
- "Cats and dogs," huh?
- Yeah.

565
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:48,080
Oh, "cats and dogs."

566
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:53,120
Oh, I see you're
interested in fishing.

567
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,920
- Yeah.
- I've fished myself-- many years.

568
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,800
Muskee, Wisconsin.
Ooh, a beauty.

569
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:03,550
- Where's the missus?
- Out at the PTA.

570
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,510
- Ahh.
- What was this in reference...?

571
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,640
I spoke to your wife
earlier on the phone.

572
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,640
I called, I'm in town
with Rio Rancho.

573
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,850
Yes, I'm sorry. She said you had
some sort of award?

574
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:16,230
Yes, I was speaking to the people
in my sales organization--

575
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:20,030
my representatives in this area--
and Mr. Spannel--

576
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:22,950
your name is Larry.
Mind if I call you Larry?

577
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:26,700
All right, Larry.
We had a consultant,

578
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,950
and he made me--
he made me an offer.

579
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:33,540
He offered me $230,000
to promote a sales plan--

580
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:38,130
to present investment opportunities
in Rio Rancho to the public.

581
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,460
Well, I said, "Hell,
let me save you the 230,

582
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:44,590
and pass the savings
along to the investor."

583
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:47,850
My people immediately said,
"Whoa, how do you do that?

584
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:50,890
How can you present
investment opportunities

585
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:53,140
without television,
without magazine ads?"

586
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,140
I said, "You take
something this good,

587
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,440
you go to a man--
has invested in the past--

588
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,360
you go to him direct and offer
the money to him-- rebate.

589
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,570
And don't give it
to this expert."

590
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,030
So you're here
to sell me some land?

591
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,280
No, I wouldn't try
to sell you--

592
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:13,750
I leave that to the salesmen
and people who want to own land.

593
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,580
I think something
has to be fed,

594
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,590
watered and painted,
but don't invest in it.

595
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:22,170
That motto has stood me
in good stead.

596
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,470
- Mister--
- Just call me Shelly.

597
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,760
I have never
been afraid of familiarity.

598
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,890
I'm walking out the door.
I've got to pick up my wife at the--

599
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:31,350
Let's take my car.
We'll pick her up together.

600
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,640
Spoke to the little woman
on the phone-- can't wait to meet her.

601
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,520
No, we're going
over to our relatives'.

602
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,230
- She didn't say anything about that.
- I'm sure she forgot.

603
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,940
- I'm on a plane to Florida--
- I'm sorry if we put you out.

604
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,530
You didn't put me out.
I'm just trying to think, Larry.

605
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:46,200
You know, that's the only parcel
that I've got.

606
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,990
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go back to the computer,

607
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:52,200
I'm gonna pull another one, and we're
gonna speak to your relatives, too.

608
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,660
- No, no, no.
- C'mon, you're a busy man, so am I.

609
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,620
My God, I'm in the act
of giving a gift away.

610
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,630
Look, I don't want to buy land.
I don't want to invest in land.

611
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:05,210
I have nothing. She took the call
without my knowledge.

612
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,550
I have no business
that I wish to transact.

613
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,510
I don't want to tell you
how to handle your wife.

614
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:13,390
My wife filled in a form, and we
have been plagued for the last year--

615
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:16,430
That's the situation
I'm trying to alleviate, Larry.

616
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,270
No, no.
Do you understand?

617
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,360
Thank you. No.

618
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,330
- Roma, man-- he don't care.
- He don't care.

619
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:42,840
He's sitting on top of the world.
He's got good leads, good prospects.

620
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,250
- Sales, sales.
- Sales contests.

621
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,130
- That's what I'm saying.
- Times turn hard, they bounce you out.

622
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,260
If they bounce you with no
confidence--

623
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,890
That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying to you.

624
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,730
If they get you
on a bad beat--

625
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:03,270
and you got to go out there,
get a new job--

626
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,150
- With no--
- With no confidence--

627
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,730
Yes.

628
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:11,030
I'll tell you what the hard part is--
to stop thinking like a goddamn slave.

629
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:14,580
You say the Nazis
in Europe--
"If they came in my door"--

630
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,040
bullshit, the time is now.
What do you do now?

631
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,460
Some guy pissing in your face.
Cocksucker--

632
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,960
wants to break your rice bowl.

633
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,590
Mitch and Murray, fuck you.
What I say-- fuck you!

634
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,460
Sitting on the good leads.

635
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:31,380
George, we're men here.

636
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,970
Yes.

637
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:37,970
And I'll tell you--
I'll tell you what the hard part is.

638
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,640
- What?
- Starting up.

639
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:43,480
Standing up.
Breaking free of this bullshit,

640
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,230
this enslavement to some guy,
'cause he's got the upper hand.

641
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,950
This is the difference--
listen to me, George.

642
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:55,200
Now Jerry Graff went
into business for himself.

643
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,830
He said, "I'm going on my own."
And he was free, you understand me?

644
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,080
I'll tell you-- I'll tell you
what somebody should do.

645
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,130
What?

646
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:11,840
Somebody should stand up
and strike back.

647
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,220
Somebody should do something
to them.

648
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,510
- What?
- Something to pay them back.

649
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,430
Someone should hurt them,
Mitch and Murray.

650
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,220
- Somebody should hurt them?
- Yeah.

651
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,140
- How?
- Someone should do something

652
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,940
- to hurt them where they live.
- What?

653
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:27,230
Someone should rob the office.
That's what I'm saying.

654
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,730
If we were that kind of guy
to hold up the joint and trash it,

655
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,860
it looks like robbery,
we take the leads out of the files

656
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,860
and we go to Jerry Graff.

657
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:39,740
And we take the fucking
Glengarry leads! Huh?

658
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,830
Yeah, Mr. Nyborg? Ah, Mr. Nyborg,
Sheldon Levene.

659
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,540
I was speaking to your wife earlier.
That's right.

660
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,260
I'd like to speak to you
about awarding you your prize.

661
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,300
We're coming to the end
of our fiscal year,

662
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,050
I'd really like to get it
off the books before--

663
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:00,140
yes, the prize
for Consolidated Properties.

664
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,730
The information you requested
on Rio Rancho.

665
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:06,020
Now, I'm in town only for--
well, let me see.

666
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,060
I suppose I could
swing by tonight. Yes. Uh-huh.

667
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,690
When do you think
it might be more convenient?

668
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:14,360
As I said,
I could swing by tonight--

669
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,910
well, of course,
you speak to your wife.

670
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,910
Grace, I'm gonna need

671
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:21,580
a first-class seat,
passport, 10,000 in cash,

672
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,870
put that with the negotiable
papers, if you would.

673
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:28,170
And put me
on the telex hookup-- yes?

674
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:31,750
Well, when do you think
Mrs. Nyborg might be back?

675
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:35,220
All train compartments
smell vaguely of shit.

676
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,510
It gets so you don't
mind it.

677
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,760
That's the worst thing
that I can confess.

678
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,390
You know how long it took me
to get there? A long time.

679
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:50,610
When you die you're gonna regret
the things you don't do.

680
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:53,780
You think you're queer?
I'm gonna tell you something.

681
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:57,280
We're all queer.
You think you're a thief? So what?

682
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,910
You get befuddled
by a middle-class morality?

683
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,950
Get shut of it.
Shut it out.

684
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:06,080
You cheat on your wife,
you did it. Live with it.

685
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,420
You fuck little girls,
so be it.

686
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:13,250
There's an absolute morality?
Maybe.

687
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,970
And then what?

688
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:19,640
If you think there is,
go ahead, be that thing.

689
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,640
Bad people go to hell?
I don't think so.

690
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,640
You think that,
act that way.

691
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:31,110
A hell exists on earth?
Yes. I won't live in it.

692
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:33,150
That's me.

693
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:41,740
Did you ever take a dump, made you
feel like you slept for 12 hours?

694
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,450
- Did I...?
- Yes.

695
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:48,040
- I don't know.
- Or a piss?

696
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,420
Great meals fade
in reflection.

697
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,130
Everything else gains.
Do you know why?

698
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,590
'Cause it's only food.
This shit we put in us,

699
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,140
keeps us going--
it's only food.

700
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,640
The great fucks
you may have had,

701
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,690
what do you remember
about them?

702
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:13,860
- What do I remember?
- Yeah.

703
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,320
I don't know.
For me,

704
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,860
I'm saying what it is,
it's probably not the orgasm.

705
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:26,330
Some broad's forearm
on your neck,

706
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:30,870
something her eyes did.
There was this sound she made.

707
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,880
Or it's me in the--
I'm telling you--

708
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,880
I'm in bed the next day,
she brought me cafР№ au lait,

709
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,380
gives me a cigarette,
my balls feel like concrete.

710
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,970
Eh?

711
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:48,390
What I'm saying,
what is our life?

712
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:53,810
Our life is looking forward
or it's looking back.

713
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:57,690
That's it.
That's our life.

714
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:00,360
Where's the moment?

715
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:07,910
And what is it
we're so afraid of?

716
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,830
Loss. What else?

717
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:15,080
The bank closes, we get sick,
my wife died on a plane?

718
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,710
The stock market collapsed?
What of these things happen?

719
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,930
None of them.
We worry anyway. Why?

720
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,220
What could we get
for them?

721
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,100
- For them?
- For the leads.

722
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,100
What could we get
for the leads?

723
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:35,560
I don't know. 10 bucks a throw.
15 maybe. I don't know.

724
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,820
For the leads, you're saying?
Say somebody took them,

725
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,990
- went to Jerry Graff?
- Yeah. How many leads do we have?

726
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,360
The Glengarry?
The premium leads?

727
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:47,660
I've got to think they've got 500.
Say 500 leads.

728
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,000
You're saying a fella could take
those leads and sell them to Graff?

729
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,330
The leads to Graff.
Yes. I was saying-- yeah.

730
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:56,000
A guy could take--
like anything else, it seems to me,

731
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,590
that is negotiable,
a guy could sell them.

732
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:02,050
- How do you know he'd buy them?
- Because I worked for him.

733
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:05,840
- You didn't talk to him?
- No. What do you mean?

734
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:08,010
- Did I talk to him about this?
- Yeah.

735
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,430
Are you just talking about this,
or are we just talking about it?

736
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:12,890
- Just speaking about it.
- Speaking about it as an idea?

737
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,140
- Yes.
- We're not actually talking about it.

738
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,940
- No.
- Talking about it as a robbery.

739
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:20,770
As a robbery? No.

740
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:25,450
- Well...
- Hey.

741
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:28,280
So all this--
you didn't actually call Graff?

742
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,870
- You didn't talk to him?
- Not actually, no.

743
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:33,160
- You didn't?
- No, not actually.

744
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,790
- Did you?
- What did I say?

745
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:36,670
- What did you say?
- I said, "Not actually."

746
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:38,920
Fuck you care, George?
We're just talking.

747
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,290
- We are?
- Yes.

748
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:43,760
- Because it's a crime.
- Robbery. That's right.

749
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:47,470
It is a crime.

750
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:52,970
- It's also very safe.
- You're actually talking about this.

751
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:55,810
- That's right.
- You're going to steal the leads.

752
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:57,310
- Have I said that?
- Are you?

753
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:59,190
- Did I say that?
- Did you talk to Graff?

754
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,810
- What did I say?
- What did he say?

755
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,690
What did he say?

756
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,990
He'd buy them.

757
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:19,000
You're gonna steal--

758
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,250
you're gonna steal the Glengarry
leads and sell them to Graff?

759
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:25,340
- Yes.
- What's he gonna pay?

760
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,630
He figures there's 500 leads,
let's say 10 bucks apiece,

761
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:32,300
- that's $2,500 each.
- Each?

762
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:34,350
- "Each"?
- That's right, George.

763
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:36,850
- You're saying me?
- No, you and me.

764
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:41,150
Yeah. That's exactly
what I'm saying. $2,500 apiece.

765
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:43,520
You and me for one night's work,
and a job with Graff

766
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:46,360
- working the premium leads.
- A job with Graff?

767
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,820
- Is that what I said?
- He'd give me a job?

768
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,990
He could take you on.
Yes.

769
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,180
Hello?

770
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:17,680
I was dialing the direct line
to my daughter's room.

771
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,480
Sheldon Levene.
She's in--

772
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:25,150
well, yeah, I'm sure she's asleep.
But-- where's the duty nurse?

773
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,700
They canceled her--
well, let me talk--

774
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,780
who am I speaking to?

775
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:37,870
I'll have the money there
tomorrow.

776
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:40,370
It's a big decision,
George.

777
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:43,880
At times a guy
has got to make one.

778
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,050
It's a big decision
and it's a big reward.

779
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:49,380
$2,500 and a job, it's a big reward
for one night's work.

780
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:51,590
Yes.

781
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:54,180
Sometimes a guy...

782
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,600
sometimes, a man
if he wants a reward--

783
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,220
That's absolutely right.

784
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,270
He'll do one thing,
one thing on one night.

785
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:05,940
That's absolutely right.
The thing is, it's got to be tonight.

786
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,070
What?

787
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:09,110
What, what?
The leads ain't going to leave?

788
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:11,400
They bring those leads up,
wave them under your nose,

789
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:13,610
tomorrow they take them downtown,
parcel them out.

790
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:16,490
A guy wants those leads,
he's gonna have to get them tonight.

791
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:19,500
Tonight is the thing.
Talk about a chance.

792
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,290
It's when a chance
presents itself.

793
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:22,960
You got to go
in there tonight.

794
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,380
- You.
- I'm sorry?

795
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,130
- You.
- Me?

796
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:28,250
You have to go in.
You have to get the leads.

797
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,800
- I do?
- It's not something for nothing.

798
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,640
I took you in on this.
You have to go. It's your thing.

799
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,850
I've made a deal with Graff.
I can't go in.

800
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:40,220
I've spoken out on this too much.
I've got a big mouth.

801
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:43,270
"The fucking leads," et cetera,
"the tight-ass company," blah, blah.

802
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:46,310
- They'll know when you go to Graff.
- What will they know?

803
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:48,610
That I stole the leads?
I didn't steal the leads.

804
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:51,440
I'm gonna go to the movies.
Then I'm gonna have a late drink

805
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:53,700
- at the Como Inn with a friend.
- Dave.

806
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,110
Yes?

807
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:57,240
You want me to break into the office
tonight and steal the leads?

808
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,580
- Yes.
- No.

809
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,240
- Oh, yes, George.
- What does that mean?

810
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:04,750
Listen to this. I have an alibi.
I'm going to the Como Inn.

811
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:07,580
Why? Why?
The place gets robbed,

812
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:10,130
they're going to come looking for me.
Why? Because I probably did it.

813
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:12,630
Let me ask you this--
are you going to turn me in?

814
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:14,550
What if you don't get caught?

815
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:16,140
They come to you,
are you going to turn me in?

816
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:18,180
- Why would they come to me?
- They're going to come to everybody.

817
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:20,010
- Why would I do it?
- You wouldn't, George.

818
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,140
That's why I'm talking to you now.
They come to you,

819
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,980
- are you going to turn me in?
- No.

820
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,690
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

821
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:30,770
Uh-huh. George...
when they come to me,

822
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,490
if I have to go in there,
and if I get caught--

823
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:36,450
- they come to me...
- You don't have to go in.

824
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:38,320
I have to go in, see?
That's something I have to do.

825
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:40,490
- Why?
- Why?

826
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:42,160
Are you going to give me $7,500?

827
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,460
75? I thought we were
splitting five grand.

828
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:47,500
I lied, all right? Your end is 25,
my end is my own concern.

829
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:50,590
Now, stick with me here.
If they come to me,

830
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:53,300
I'm caught, they're going to ask me
who were accomplices.

831
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,010
- Me.
- Absolutely.

832
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:56,380
That's ridiculous.

833
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:58,300
To the law, you're
an accessory before the fact.

834
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,260
- I didn't ask to be.
- Tough luck, because you are.

835
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:03,970
- Because you told me about it?
- That's right.

836
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,600
Why are you doing this
to me, Dave?

837
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,270
Why are you talking this way to me?
I don't understand.

838
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:12,610
- Why are you doing this at all?
- None of your fucking business.

839
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:14,530
Just in or out?
You tell me.

840
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:16,200
You're out,
you take the consequences.

841
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,200
- I do?
- That's right.

842
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,200
- And why is that?
- Because you listened.

843
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:22,280
Well, when will
Mrs. Nyborg be back?

844
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:24,950
You know, I hate to keep
calling you this late, Bruce,

845
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,210
but I feel a responsibility,
I must say. When you have--

846
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,340
You know, they say,
"You don't buy it, you rent it."

847
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,720
- Huh?
- The thing.

848
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,720
You really...
what do you keep?

849
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,560
I mean, you don't keep
anything, really.

850
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,390
- No.
- Security.

851
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,100
Things. Things.

852
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,520
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.

853
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:57,240
It's just... you try
to stave off insecurity.

854
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,700
You can't do it.

855
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:01,240
- No.
- No. That's what I'm telling you.

856
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:06,540
Stocks, bonds, objects of art,
real estate, what are they?

857
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:10,120
An opportunity.
To what? To make money?

858
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:14,130
Perhaps. To lose money?
Perhaps.

859
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:17,630
To indulge and to learn
about ourselves? Perhaps.

860
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:20,840
So fucking what?
What is it? They're an opportunity.

861
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,850
That's all they are.
They're an event.

862
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:27,560
A guy comes to you,
you make a call. You send in a card,

863
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,440
I have these properties
I would like for you to see.

864
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:33,480
What does this mean?
What do you want it to mean?

865
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,690
You see what I'm saying?

866
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,740
Things happen to you.

867
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:44,620
Glad I met you.

868
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,450
I'm glad I met you,
James.

869
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:51,170
I want to show you
something.

870
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,750
It may mean something to you,
it may not.

871
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:56,670
I don't know.
I don't know anymore.

872
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:02,510
What is that?
Florida.

873
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:05,470
Glengarry Highlands.
Florida.

874
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:08,470
Bullshit.
And maybe that's true.

875
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,690
And that's what I said.

876
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:14,270
But look at this.

877
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:18,780
What is this?
This is a piece of land.

878
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,280
Listen to what I'm going
to tell you now.

879
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:51,430
- What happened?
- Where do you work?

880
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,100
I work, yes.
I work here.

881
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:56,650
- What is it? What happened?
- Robbery.

882
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:07,160
Williamson. Williamson,
did they get the contracts?

883
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:12,250
All right, tell me.
Now. Tell me.

884
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:14,160
- They stole the contracts?
- Excuse me, sir.

885
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,620
- Did they get my contract?
- Excuse me, fella.

886
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:16,960
- Did they?
- Would you excuse us?

887
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,130
Don't fuck with me, fella.
I'm talking about a Cadillac car

888
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:21,840
- that you owe me.
- They didn't get your contract.

889
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,260
- I filed it before I left.
- They didn't get my contracts?

890
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,260
They got-- excuse me.

891
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,350
Fuck.

892
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:31,180
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Williamson!

893
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:34,180
- Williamson, open the fucking door.
- Who are you?

894
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:36,350
- They didn't get the contracts.
- Did they?

895
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,980
They got-- listen to me.
They got some of them.

896
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,690
- Some of them?
- Who told you?

897
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:45,150
Who told me?
Who told me we had a robbery?

898
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:46,860
We got a fucking board
up on the window.

899
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:51,370
Who is this? Yes.
Yes, I confess. I did it.

900
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:53,750
Now, leave me
a second here, please.

901
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:56,500
- Okay, now, talk to me.
- I'm still trying to sort it out.

902
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,750
- So far--
- Talk to me. Talk to me.

903
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:02,050
They got some
of the contracts?

904
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:05,340
Lingk. James Lingk,
which I closed last night.

905
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,050
- You closed it last night?
- Yes.

906
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:10,800
- I filed it. It went down.
- You filed it?

907
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:13,220
- James Lingk?
- Yes.

908
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:15,230
- It was sent downtown?
- Yes, all right?

909
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:17,230
I filed it last night.
It went to the bank.

910
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:19,650
- It went downtown, all right?
- You filed it?

911
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:22,360
Then I'm over the fucking top,
you owe me a Cadillac.

912
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,650
- I don't--
- I don't want to hear any shit.

913
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,700
I don't give a shit.
Lingk puts me over the top.

914
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,780
You filed it. It went downtown.
Now you owe me the car.

915
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,790
- The robbery makes difficult--
- Fuck you! You owe me the car!

916
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:36,500
See, 'cause this is how
we keep score, "bubby."

917
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:39,710
You told me, "Close thus,
and so you get the car."

918
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:42,800
- I got it.
- Would you excuse us, please?

919
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,800
You hear what I said?
Do you hear what I said?

920
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:49,390
Hey, pal!
Your excuses are your own!

921
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,690
"Recontact James Lingk.

922
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:06,570
6:00 p.m. Morton Grove."
Ah-ha.

923
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:09,150
When do you expect
her in?

924
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,950
This is Ricky Roma
from last night.

925
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:15,120
She'll remember.
Just, just-- wait a minute!

926
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,540
Just to say-- to thank her
for a wonderful time.

927
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,130
Thank you.
I'll call back later. Thank you.

928
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,540
They should check
if we're insured.

929
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,550
Uh-huh.

930
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:31,550
"10:00 p.m., Octavia."

931
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:34,640
Please don't leave.
I'm going to talk to you.

932
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,600
- What's your name?
- Are you talking to me?

933
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,690
- That's right.
- My name is Richard Roma.

934
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:55,160
I-- you know,
they should be insured.

935
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,750
- What do you care?
- Then they wouldn't be so upset.

936
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,290
- Huh?
- They wouldn't be so upset.

937
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:03,000
- Mitch and Murray.
- Yeah, you're right.

938
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,880
That's right.
How are you?

939
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,170
I'm fine.

940
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:09,760
You mean the board?
You mean on the board?

941
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:14,680
Yes. Okay.
The board.

942
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,260
I'm fucked on the board.
I can't--

943
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,190
My mind must be other places,
'cause I can't--

944
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:24,650
What?
You can't do what?

945
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:27,480
- I can't close them.
- Well, they're old.

946
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:31,240
Look, look at this shit
they're giving you. Huh?

947
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,530
- Yes, they are old.
- They're ancient.

948
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:36,080
"Clear Meadows."
This shit's dead.

949
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,490
- It is dead.
- Waste of time.

950
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:42,080
- Yes. I'm no fucking good.
- Hey, fuck that shit, George.

951
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,380
You had a bad month.
You're a good man.

952
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:46,210
- I am?
- Yeah, you had a bad streak.

953
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:50,090
Look at this. 15 units, Mountain View,
the fucking things get stolen.

954
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:53,800
- He said he filed--
- He filed the big one.

955
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,010
He filed the guy from the bar
that I closed last night.

956
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:58,560
All the little ones,
I got to go back.

957
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:03,560
Can you believe this?
I got to go back and close again.

958
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,230
I mean, talk about
a fucking beat

959
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:09,940
that would sap anyone's-- wait,
wait, wait. Where are the phones?

960
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:12,820
- They stole--
- They stole...?

961
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,410
- What kind of an outfit is it...
- They stole the phones.

962
00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:18,240
...when criminals come and they take--
they steal the phones?

963
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,540
They stole the leads.
They stole the phones,

964
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:23,250
they stole-- aw, Christ.

965
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:27,540
What am I going
to do this month? Shit.

966
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:29,590
You think they're going to catch--
where are you going?

967
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:31,840
Down the street.

968
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:37,850
- Where are you going?
- To the-- what do you fucking care?

969
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:42,310
- Aren't you going out today?
- With what, John? With what?

970
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:45,560
Well, answer me.
They stole the Glengarry leads.

971
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:49,150
- They stole Rio Rancho.
- I have stuff from last year's file.

972
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:52,440
Oh, oh, oh.
Your "nostalgia" file.

973
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,280
Oh, great. That's great,
'cause I don't...

974
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,570
- Do you want to go out today?
- I don't have to eat this month.

975
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:00,200
Great.
Give them to me.

976
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,750
Bring them.
Come on.

977
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,750
Fucking Mitch and Murray
are going to shit a--

978
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:11,920
What am I going
to do all month?

979
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,300
See, the thing
of it is,

980
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:16,880
is were the leads insured?
You think?

981
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:19,890
- What?
- Were the leads insured?

982
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:22,310
I don't know, why?

983
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:24,270
'Cause if they weren't,
I know Mitch and Murray...

984
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:26,770
- What?
- They'll be upset.

985
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:29,270
That's right.

986
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:31,610
You're right.

987
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:35,320
He said we're all going
to have to talk to the guy.

988
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,950
- To...
- The cop.

989
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:39,070
Great. We have to talk
to the cop.

990
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,830
- Another waste of time.
- A waste of time? Why?

991
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:44,830
Why? 'Cause they're not going
to find the guy.

992
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:48,790
- The cops?
- Yes, the cops. No.

993
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:50,500
The cops aren't going
to find the guy?

994
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,340
- Nope.
- Why do you think so?

995
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,920
Why? Because they are stupid.
Where were you last night?

996
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:58,510
- Where were you?
- Where was I?

997
00:56:58,510 --> 00:56:59,640
- Yeah.
- I was at home.

998
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:00,800
- Where were you?
- At home.

999
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,720
See? Were you the guy
who broke in?

1000
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,850
- Was I?
- Yes.

1001
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:06,140
- No.
- Then don't sweat it. You know why?

1002
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:08,310
- No.
- You have nothing to hide.

1003
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:11,110
- When I talk to police, I get nervous.
- Yes, you know who doesn't?

1004
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:13,730
- No. Who?
- Thieves.

1005
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,530
I don't know
what I'm going to tell them.

1006
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,860
The truth.
Always tell them the truth.

1007
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,950
It's the easiest thing
to remember.

1008
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:23,530
Whoa, whoa!
"Patel"?

1009
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:26,120
"Ravidam Patel"?

1010
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,960
How am I going to make a living
on these deadbeats?

1011
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
- Where did you get this from, a morgue?
- Look, I'm--

1012
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,250
Come on. What's the point?
What's the fucking point?

1013
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:36,170
I got to argue with you,
I got to knock heads with the cops,

1014
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:38,050
I'm busting my balls
to sell your dirt

1015
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:40,930
to deadbeats--
money in the mattress.

1016
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:43,550
I come back, you can't even
keep the contracts safe.

1017
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:45,760
I got to go out--
fuck this shit.

1018
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:47,640
I'm going to go out
and re-close last week's stuff.

1019
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,770
No, the word from Murray
is leave them alone.

1020
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:52,060
If he needs a new sig,
he'll go out himself.

1021
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:55,150
- Murray's gonna go out?
- He'll be "president of the company

1022
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:57,480
just in from out of town,"
all right?

1023
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:02,030
Okay, okay, okay.
Give me this shit.

1024
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:04,580
- I'm giving you three leads.
- Three? I count two.

1025
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:06,870
- There's three leads there.
- Patel? Fuck you.

1026
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:09,910
Fucking Shiva handed
this guy a million dollars,

1027
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,210
told him, "Sign the deal,"
he wouldn't sign.

1028
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:15,040
And the god Vishnu, too,
into the bargain. Fuck you.

1029
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:17,960
You know your business, I know mine.
Your business is being an asshole.

1030
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:20,630
If I find out whose fucking cousin
you are, I'm gonna go to him

1031
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,930
and figure out a way
to have your ass-- fuck you!

1032
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:27,640
I'm waiting
for the new leads.

1033
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,850
Get the chalk!
Hey! Get the chalk!

1034
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:37,730
Get the--
I did it-- I closed 'em.

1035
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:39,560
I closed the cocksucker.
Get the chalk.

1036
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:43,150
Put me on the board, John.
Put me on the Cadillac board!

1037
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:45,990
Williamson,
pick up the fucking chalk.

1038
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:50,160
- Rick-- eight units, Mountain View.
- You sold eight Mountain View?

1039
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:52,490
You bet your ass!
Who wants to go to lunch?

1040
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,660
Who wants to go to lunch--
I'm buying.

1041
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:58,500
Williamson-- $82,000,
12 grand in my commission.

1042
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:00,880
On deadbeat
magazine subscription leads.

1043
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,590
- Who?
- Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.

1044
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,010
Read it.
What the hell happened here?

1045
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:08,220
Fuck! I had them
on River Glen.

1046
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:10,050
- What happened?
- Somebody broke in.

1047
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,300
- Eight units!
- Yeah.

1048
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:15,310
- Shelly!
- Big deal-- I broke a bad streak.

1049
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:17,600
Shelly "The Machine" Levene.
That's great.

1050
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,600
Thank you, George.
Hey--

1051
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,060
- grab the phone, call Mitch.
- They took the phones.

1052
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:23,770
- Huh?
- Aaronow?

1053
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:26,070
They took the leads,
the cash, the contracts.

1054
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:27,940
- We had a robbery.
- When?

1055
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:30,780
- Last night, this morning.
- They took the leads?

1056
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:35,530
Fucking asshole.

1057
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:37,790
What? They beat you
with a rubber bat?

1058
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:40,210
Cop couldn't find his dick
with two hands and a map.

1059
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:42,630
Anybody who talks to this asshole
is a fucking asshole.

1060
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:44,790
- You gonna turn state's?
- Fuck you, Ricky.

1061
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:47,710
I ain't going out today.
I'm going home.

1062
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,090
I'm going home because nothing's
accomplished here.

1063
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:52,220
- Anybody talks to this guy--
- Guess what "The Machine" did.

1064
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:55,640
- Fuck "The Machine."
- Mountain View, eight units.

1065
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,810
Cop's got no right to talk to me
that way. I did not rob the place.

1066
00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:01,980
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yeah, he closed the deal.

1067
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,400
Eight units,
Mountain View.

1068
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,980
- You did that?
- Yeah.

1069
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:10,320
- Fuck you.
- Guess who?

1070
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,990
- When?
- Just now.

1071
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:14,370
- Guess who?
- You just-- this morning?

1072
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,950
Harriett
and blah blah Nyborg.

1073
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:20,250
- You did that?
- Yeah-- $82,000.

1074
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:24,880
- Those fucking deadbeats.
- My ass. I told 'em-- listen to this.

1075
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:28,130
- I don't want to hear your war stories.
- Fuck you, Dave.

1076
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:30,630
I said, "You have to believe
in yourself."

1077
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:33,130
Give me a lead.
I'm going out. I'm getting out.

1078
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:38,010
- Fuck the leads. I'm going home.
- "Fuck me, Bruce.

1079
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,640
- You have to believe in yourself."
- We haven't got a lead.

1080
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,180
- Why not?
- They took 'em.

1081
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:44,850
They're fucking garbage, any case.
The whole goddamn--

1082
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:48,270
"You look around, you say,
'This one has so-and-so. I got nothing.

1083
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,860
But why? Why don't I get
the opportunities?"'

1084
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:53,490
- Did they steal the contracts?
- What the fuck do you care?

1085
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:55,360
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

1086
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:57,450
Will you shut up?
I'm telling him something.

1087
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:01,080
Could we get
some coffee?

1088
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:03,290
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

1089
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:06,460
Uh-huh.

1090
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,460
Anybody's going out,
I could use some coffee.

1091
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:14,300
- "You do get the opportunity."
- Fuck is that supposed to mean?

1092
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:16,680
"You do get the opportunities.
You get 'em as I get 'em,

1093
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:19,470
- as everybody gets 'em."
- I don't care they stole the contracts?

1094
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:21,680
I got 'em in the kitchen,
eating their crumb cake--

1095
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,980
- What does that mean?
- It means, Dave,

1096
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:26,310
You haven't closed
a good one in a month.

1097
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,190
None of my business,
you want to push me to answer you.

1098
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:31,360
So you haven't got a contract
to get stolen and so forth.

1099
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,320
You got a mean streak in you.
Shut the fuck up!

1100
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:37,530
Ricky, you got a mean streak in you,
and what are you babbling about?

1101
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:39,490
You bring that shit up--
on my volume?

1102
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:42,700
If you were on a bad one and I
brought it up to you, you'd harbor it.

1103
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:45,250
You'd harbor it a long while
and you'd be right.

1104
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:47,710
- Who said "Fuck 'The Machine"'?
- Fuck "The Machine"?

1105
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:50,290
Fuck "The Machine"?
Fuck "The Machine"!

1106
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:53,710
What is this, courtesy class?
You're fucked, Rick.

1107
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,550
Are you fucking nuts?
You're hot, so you think

1108
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:58,220
- you're the ruler of this place.
- Wait a minute, Dave.

1109
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:00,010
- Shut up!
- Okay...

1110
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:02,640
You want to decide who
should be dealt with how, is that it?

1111
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,560
I come into the office today,
I get humiliated by some jag-off cop.

1112
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,520
I get accused of--

1113
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:11,270
I get shit thrown in my face because
you're top name on the board?

1114
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:14,240
Is that what I did, Dave--
I humiliated you?

1115
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:17,820
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- Sitting on top of the world.

1116
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:20,740
Sitting on top of the world--
everything's fucking peach fuzz.

1117
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:24,040
I don't get a moment to spare
for some bust-out humanitarian

1118
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,960
- down on his luck lately?
- Fuck you!

1119
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,830
Fuck you, Dave--
you know you got a big mouth.

1120
01:02:27,830 --> 01:02:31,130
You make a close, this whole place
stinks with your farts for a week--

1121
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:35,550
how much you just ingested.
Oh, what a big man you are!

1122
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:38,260
"Let me buy you a pack of gum--
I'll show you how to chew it."

1123
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:41,300
Your pal closes, and all that comes
out of your mouth is bile.

1124
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:44,560
How fucked-up you are!

1125
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:49,480
Who's my pal, Ricky? Hmm?
And what are you?

1126
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,900
What are you, huh,
Bishop Sheen?

1127
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:55,070
What the fuck are you,
"Mr. Slick"?

1128
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:57,740
What the fuck are you,
"Friend to the working man"?

1129
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:00,200
Big deal!
Fuck you!

1130
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:04,740
You got the memory
of a fucking fly!

1131
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:09,750
I never liked you,
anyway.

1132
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:11,960
What is this,
your farewell speech?

1133
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,460
- I'm going home.
- Your farewell to the troops?

1134
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,340
I'm not going home.
I'm going to Wisconsin.

1135
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:18,880
- Have a good trip.
- Aw, fuck you!

1136
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:22,470
Fuck the lot of you!
Fuck you all!

1137
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,480
You were saying?

1138
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:31,230
Huh?

1139
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:33,110
Come on.

1140
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:35,480
Come on-- you got 'em
in the kitchen,

1141
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,190
you're in
your shirtsleeves,

1142
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:40,530
you got
the stats spread out,

1143
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:43,910
you can smell it.
Come on, snap out of it.

1144
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:47,330
- You're eating her crumb cake.
- Oh yeah, I'm eating her crumb cake.

1145
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:50,500
- How was it?
- From the store.

1146
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:53,130
- Fuck her.
- "Bruce, Harriett...

1147
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:57,050
we have to admit to ourselves
that we see that opportunity

1148
01:03:57,090 --> 01:04:00,550
and take it-- and that's it."
Now, we just sit there.

1149
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:02,430
- I got my pen out.
- "Always Be Closing."

1150
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:05,010
God, that's what
I've been saying-- the old ways.

1151
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:08,640
Convert that motherfucker,
sell him, make him sign the check.

1152
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,640
They got their money
in government bonds--

1153
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,270
I said, "Fuck it-- let's go
all the way, the whole route."

1154
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:18,650
I take it and plat it out-- eight units,
82 grand, and I say to them,

1155
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:23,820
"This is now. This is that thing
that you have been dreaming of.

1156
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:26,370
You are going to find
the suitcase on the train.

1157
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:29,660
The man walks in the room,
that bag is filled with money.

1158
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:33,290
Harriett, this is it, and Bruce--
I don't want to fuck around with you.

1159
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:36,540
No, I don't. I don't want
to pussyfoot around.

1160
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:39,840
You think you got to look back
on this thing? I do, too.

1161
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:43,380
Now, I'm here to do good
for you and me-- the both of us.

1162
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:46,720
What is the point
of some interim position?

1163
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:50,390
The only arrangement
I will accept is full investment.

1164
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:53,560
And I mean it, that's it--
all eight units. Period."

1165
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:56,190
Now I got the pen
in my hand, Rick-- hey.

1166
01:04:56,230 --> 01:05:01,150
I turned that contract around--
that's eight units, 82 grand--

1167
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:05,280
and I said,
"I want you to sign."

1168
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:08,330
I sat there five minutes.

1169
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:13,870
Then I sat 22 minutes
by that kitchen clock on the wall.

1170
01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:16,710
Ricky-- not a word,
not a motion.

1171
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:19,460
And what am I thinking?
"Is my arm getting tired?"

1172
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:22,340
No. I did it.
Just like the old days,

1173
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:24,050
like I used to,
like I was taught.

1174
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:26,220
- I did it.
- Like you taught me.

1175
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:29,350
Nobody ever--
well, if I did, I'm glad.

1176
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:31,470
No, what I did--
I locked on 'em.

1177
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:34,190
I locked all on them--
nothing on me-- on them.

1178
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:37,360
And, oh God, I am holding
my last thought,

1179
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,070
"Now is the time."

1180
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:44,780
They signed.
It was great.

1181
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:47,530
It was so fucking great.

1182
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:51,490
It was like
they wilted all at once.

1183
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:54,210
- Mmm.
- No gesture, nothing-- just together.

1184
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:59,340
Honest to God, they both
imperceptibly slumped.

1185
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:03,050
And then he reached
and he took the pen and he signed,

1186
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:05,220
passed it to her
and she signed.

1187
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:07,550
It was solemn--
fucking solemn.

1188
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:12,640
I let it sit, and then I nodded.
I said, "Harriett, Bruce,"

1189
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:15,140
then I pointed into the living room
to the sideboard.

1190
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,440
I didn't know there was
a sideboard in there.

1191
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,520
He went over,
he brought us back a drink--

1192
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:23,110
little shot glasses
with a pretty design in 'em.

1193
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:28,320
And we just toasted
in silence.

1194
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:31,870
Great sale, Shelly.

1195
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:33,950
Great.

1196
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,960
Fuck! Send me out!
Give me leads!

1197
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,040
- Williamson! Send me out!
- Whoa!

1198
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:40,750
- The leads are coming.
- Get 'em to me.

1199
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:43,550
I talked to Mitch and Murray
an hour ago. They're coming in.

1200
01:06:43,550 --> 01:06:46,260
- They're a bit upset over this.
- Did you tell 'em my sale?

1201
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:48,680
How could I tell 'em your sale?
I didn't have a tele--

1202
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:51,300
I'll tell 'em your sale
when they bring in the leads.

1203
01:06:51,350 --> 01:06:54,310
We had a little-- you closed the deal,
you made a good sale. Fine.

1204
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:57,270
- Better than a good sale.
- I have a lot of things on my mind.

1205
01:06:57,310 --> 01:07:00,560
They're coming and they're very upset.
I'm trying to make--

1206
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,360
All I'm telling you is, you can tell
them it was a remarkably good sale.

1207
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,190
The only thing remarkable
about it is who you made it to.

1208
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,700
- What the fuck does that mean?
- If the sale sticks it'll be a miracle.

1209
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:12,070
"If the sale sticks"?
Why shouldn't the sale stick?

1210
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:16,160
Oh, fuck you!
You do not know your job.

1211
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:18,080
Do you know that?
A man is his job!

1212
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:21,170
You are fucked at yours.
You hear what I'm saying to you?

1213
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:23,340
Your "End of the Month"
fucking boar--

1214
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:25,210
you do not know how
to run this office.

1215
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,670
You haven't got the sense.
You haven't got the balls.

1216
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:30,890
Have you ever been on a sit?
Has this cocksucker been on a sit?

1217
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:33,720
- Did you ever sit--
- If I were you, I would calm down.

1218
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,720
Would you?
What are you gonna do, fire me?

1219
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:37,770
Oh, oh, Rick, ooh.

1220
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:41,060
- It's not impossible.
- Really? On an $80,000 day?

1221
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:43,610
- It's not even noon yet.
- You closed 'em today?

1222
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:46,320
I got up early this morning,
tracked 'em down, and closed it.

1223
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:49,700
What I'm saying to you
is that things change.

1224
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:53,070
That's where you fuck up.
You don't know. You can't look back.

1225
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:57,200
You don't see who's coming.
Maybe it's someone new, huh?

1226
01:07:57,290 --> 01:07:59,500
Maybe it's someone else,
but you don't know--

1227
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:02,210
you can't look back, because
you don't know your history!

1228
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:04,630
When we were on Rio Rancho,
who was the top man, huh?

1229
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:06,630
For what,
two months, three months?

1230
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:09,670
How about eight months,
for three years in a row!

1231
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:13,510
Luck-- was that it, John?
Or purloined fucking leads?

1232
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,390
- It was talent!
- Yes.

1233
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:19,020
Door to door.
It's called "cold calling," John.

1234
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:22,520
Shit, I don't even know their name.
They don't want to buy what I've got.

1235
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:25,230
Soft sell-- we were doing it
before we had a name for it.

1236
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:27,230
- Am I right?
- You're right, you're right.

1237
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:31,110
You wouldn't know, you cock--
he doesn't even know what a streak is.

1238
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,570
What the hell are you?

1239
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:36,370
You're a fucking secretary.
Fuck you!

1240
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:39,830
That's my message to you--
fuck you, and kiss my ass.

1241
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:43,670
If you don't like that, I go across
the street and speak to Jerry Graff.

1242
01:08:43,710 --> 01:08:45,580
Period. Fuck you.

1243
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:48,840
Listen to me-- you put me
on that fucking board,

1244
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,380
and I want three
promising leads for today,

1245
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:54,470
I don't want any bullshit,
and I want 'em close together,

1246
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:56,720
because I am
going to close them all.

1247
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:00,020
And that's all I have
to say to you.

1248
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:04,440
He's right, Williamson.

1249
01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:10,280
I'm sorry, but it's wrong,
and you know whose fault it is?

1250
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,900
Mitch and Murray.

1251
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:17,280
To hell with him.
Let's get some lunch, huh, Rick?

1252
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,450
The leads won't be
up here till later anyway.

1253
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:23,000
You're a client. I just sold you
five waterfront Glengarry Farms.

1254
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,880
I do this with my hair,
throw me the cue "Kenilworth."

1255
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:28,340
- Which is it?
- Kenilworth.

1256
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:31,090
I own the property.
My mother owns the property.

1257
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:32,920
I put her into it.

1258
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:36,180
You look on the plats
when you go home. You'll see...

1259
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:39,010
A-3 through 10,
26 through 30.

1260
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:42,810
- Take your time. If you still feel--
- I won't need more time, Rick.

1261
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:44,980
- I've bought a lot of property.
- I've got to talk to you.

1262
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:47,480
Jim, what are you
doing here?

1263
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:50,780
Jim Lingk,
D. Ray Morton.

1264
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:53,900
- I'm glad to meet you.
- I put Jim into Black Creek.

1265
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:56,820
- Are you acquainted with--
- Black Creek? No.

1266
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,700
- Ooh, in Florida!
- Yes.

1267
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:01,950
- I meant to speak to you about that.
- We'll do that this weekend.

1268
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:03,790
My wife suggested
I look into it.

1269
01:10:03,790 --> 01:10:06,620
Beautiful rolling land--
I was telling Jim and Jinny.

1270
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:10,040
Ray, I got to tell you something.
You eat in a lot of restaurants?

1271
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:13,010
I know you do.
Ray is with American Express.

1272
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:14,920
- Can I tell Jim what you do?
- Sure.

1273
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:18,510
Ray is the director of all
European sales and services--

1274
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:21,640
what I'm saying is, you haven't had
a meal until you've tasted--

1275
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,520
I was at the Lingks'--

1276
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,020
what was that service feature
you were talking about?

1277
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:27,810
- Which--
- "Home cooking."

1278
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:30,690
- You had a tag phrase you used?
- "Cooking"...

1279
01:10:30,690 --> 01:10:32,360
"Home cook--"
the monthly interview.

1280
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,650
- The magazine!
- Yes.

1281
01:10:34,650 --> 01:10:37,030
Is that something
I can talk about?

1282
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:40,320
It won't be out until
the February issue, but go ahead.

1283
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:42,030
- Are you sure?
- Go ahead.

1284
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:45,160
Ray was eating at one of his
company men's homes in France.

1285
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,290
- The man is French?
- No, but his wife is.

1286
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:49,000
His wife.

1287
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,670
Ray, what time
do you have?

1288
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:54,550
- 12:15.
- I got to get you on the plane.

1289
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:56,380
- Didn't I say the 2:00?
- No, the 1:00.

1290
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:59,390
Remember the 1:00-- that's why
we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.

1291
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:01,600
You're right, the 1:00--
let's scoot.

1292
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,850
- A pleasure.
- I got to talk to you.

1293
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:06,980
I got to run Ray to the airport.
Let's hustle-- John!

1294
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:10,560
Get on the phone to Pittsburgh,
American Express there, for Mr. Morton.

1295
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,980
Tell them he's on the 1:00.
I'll see you.

1296
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:16,440
Christ, I'm sorry
you came all the way in.

1297
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,570
I'm running Ray to the airport.
You wait here and--

1298
01:11:19,570 --> 01:11:22,200
no, I can't. I'm meeting your man
at the bank.

1299
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:26,160
I wish you'd have phoned!
Are you and Jinny going to be home?

1300
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,620
- I don't know.
- Rick?

1301
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:29,210
- What?
- Kenilworth?

1302
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:31,000
- I'm sorry?
- Kenilworth.

1303
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:34,000
Oh, God. Excuse me, Ray--
just a minute.

1304
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,590
Jim, I told you who he is-- the senior
vice-president of American Express.

1305
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:40,890
His family owns 32 per--

1306
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:44,810
over the past years, I have sold him--
I can't tell you the dollar amount--

1307
01:11:44,850 --> 01:11:47,520
but quite a lot of land.

1308
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:51,060
I promised him five weeks ago that I
would go to the wife's birthday party

1309
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:53,690
in Kenilworth tonight.
I have to go, you understand?

1310
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:56,820
They treat me like a member
of the family. I have to go.

1311
01:11:56,900 --> 01:12:01,200
It's funny-- you get a picture
of the corporation-type company man,

1312
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,700
all business--
this guy, I'll tell you.

1313
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:05,700
We'll go to his house
someday.

1314
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:09,910
Let me see. Tomorrow.
I'm in L.A.?

1315
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,330
Ah, Monday.

1316
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:14,790
I'll take you to lunch.
Where would you like to eat?

1317
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:16,250
- My wife--
- Rick?

1318
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:19,630
I can't talk now, Jim--
I'll call you tonight. Coming, Ray.

1319
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:22,010
My wife said I have
to cancel the deal.

1320
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:26,260
That's a common reaction, Jim,
and let me tell you what it is.

1321
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:29,230
That's why you married her.
One of the reasons is prudence.

1322
01:12:29,230 --> 01:12:32,100
No, it's a sizable investment.
One thinks twice.

1323
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:37,110
It's also something women have.
Reaction to the size of the investment.

1324
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:39,400
Monday, you invite me
to dinner again--

1325
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,360
- This woman can cook.
- I'm sure she can.

1326
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:44,120
We are going to talk.
I want to tell you something.

1327
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,240
Something about your acreage
I want you to know.

1328
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:51,120
I can't talk about it here,
I really shouldn't, and by law--

1329
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:55,540
the man next to you--
bought his lot at 42--

1330
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:57,590
phoned to say
he already had an offer.

1331
01:12:57,630 --> 01:12:59,340
- Rick.
- I'm coming.

1332
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:01,880
Ray, what a day.
I'll call you this evening.

1333
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,260
I'm sorry you had to come
all the way in. Monday lunch.

1334
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:07,050
- We have to go.
- Monday!

1335
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:10,850
She called the consumer--
the attorney general?

1336
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:13,270
- They said we have three days.
- Who'd she call?

1337
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:16,440
The attorney ge--
it was some consumer office.

1338
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:19,980
Why'd she do that, Jim?

1339
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:21,860
I don't know.

1340
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:23,740
But they said
we have three days.

1341
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:26,910
They said
we got three days, yeah.

1342
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:28,990
Three days?

1343
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:33,160
- To... you know.
- No, I don't know.

1344
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:36,750
- Tell me.
- To change our minds.

1345
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:39,750
Of course you have--
three days.

1346
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,300
So we can't talk Monday.

1347
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:44,930
Monday--
you saw my book.

1348
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:47,600
Jim, Jim-- I can't.

1349
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,600
You saw my book.
I can't.

1350
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,680
We have to before Monday
to get our money back.

1351
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,770
Three business days,
they mean.

1352
01:13:53,850 --> 01:13:56,310
- Three business days.
- Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

1353
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:59,610
- I don't understand.
- That's what they are, three business--

1354
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:01,780
if we wait till Monday,
my time limit runs out.

1355
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:03,940
- You don't count Saturday.
- I'm not.

1356
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:06,700
I'm saying you don't include
Saturday in the three days.

1357
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:10,120
- It's not a business day.
- I am not counting it.

1358
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:14,910
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday--
so it would have elapsed.

1359
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:16,920
What would have elapsed?

1360
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,710
If we wait till Monday
it would have elapsed!

1361
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:21,050
- When did you write the check?
- Yesterday.

1362
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:22,800
- What was yesterday?
- Tuesday.

1363
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:25,970
- And when was that check cashed?
- I don't know.

1364
01:14:26,010 --> 01:14:28,510
What was the earliest
it could have been cashed?

1365
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:31,930
- I don't know.
- Today.

1366
01:14:31,890 --> 01:14:35,230
Today. Which, in any case,
it was not--

1367
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:38,350
there was something on the agreement
I wanted to go over with you.

1368
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,440
It wasn't cashed?

1369
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,690
I just phoned downtown--
it's on their desk.

1370
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:44,940
- Rick.
- One moment.

1371
01:14:44,990 --> 01:14:47,820
One point, in fact, of which
I spoke to you of which,

1372
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:49,950
I can't talk to you
about it here.

1373
01:14:49,950 --> 01:14:52,280
- Levene!
- Listen to me.

1374
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:56,330
The statute is for your protection.
I have no complaint with that.

1375
01:14:56,370 --> 01:14:58,670
In fact, I was a member
of the board when we drafted it.

1376
01:14:58,710 --> 01:15:00,710
So quite the opposite.
It says,

1377
01:15:00,710 --> 01:15:03,550
"You can change your mind
three 'working days'

1378
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,420
from the time
the deal was closed."

1379
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:07,470
- Levene!
- Wait a second!

1380
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:09,720
Which is not until
the check is cashed!

1381
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:13,260
I'm through with this "meshugaas."
Nobody should talk to a man that way.

1382
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:15,560
- How are you talking to me that way?
- Levene!

1383
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,560
- How can you talk to me that way?
- I'm gonna flag a cab.

1384
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,560
- I didn't rob--
- Shelly, get in the office.

1385
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:24,730
"Where were you last?"
Is anybody listening to me?

1386
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:28,570
- Where's Moss?
- Is this Levene?

1387
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:31,570
Perhaps I could assist you.
Excuse us, will you?

1388
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:35,160
I work here! I didn't come in here
to be mistreated!

1389
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,870
- Go to lunch, will you?
- That's why I came in to work today.

1390
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:39,710
The leads come in,
I'll let you know.

1391
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:41,710
- That's why I came in!
- Just go to lunch.

1392
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:44,000
- I don't wanna go to lunch!
- Go to lunch, George.

1393
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:46,010
Where does he get off
talking that way to a working man?

1394
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:48,220
Take it outside. We have people
trying to do business.

1395
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:50,470
That's what I came in here for.
That's what I'm trying to do!

1396
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:53,010
- I meet Gestapo tactics.
- Excuse me.

1397
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:55,180
I meet Gestapo tactics!

1398
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:57,520
I meet Gestapo tactics.
That's not right.

1399
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:03,360
No man has the right--
no man has the right--

1400
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:07,530
"Call an attorney"--
that means you're under--

1401
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:09,530
he says, "Cooperate
or we'll take you downtown."

1402
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:11,610
That's not--
as long as I've--

1403
01:16:11,570 --> 01:16:13,070
Will you get out of here?

1404
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:15,910
Will you get out of here?
Will you?

1405
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:18,910
I'm trying to run an office here.
Now, will you go to lunch?

1406
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:23,210
Go to lunch.
Will you go to lunch?

1407
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:39,270
- Excuse me.
- Where did Moss...?

1408
01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:42,520
- Excuse me, please?
- Did he go to the restaurant?

1409
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,860
Will you
excuse me, please?

1410
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,030
I'm sorry, I--

1411
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:55,830
I apologize to you. It's--

1412
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:58,410
It's not me,
it's my wife.

1413
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,290
What is it?

1414
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:04,380
- I told you.
- Tell me again.

1415
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:07,340
- What's going on here?
- Tell me again-- your wife?

1416
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:09,630
- I told you.
- Tell me again.

1417
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:12,260
She wants her money back.

1418
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:14,140
We're gonna speak to her.

1419
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:16,680
No, she told me,
"Right now."

1420
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:19,140
- We're gonna speak to her, Jim.
- She won't listen.

1421
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:21,020
- She--
- Roma!

1422
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:24,650
She said if don't get my money back,
to call the state's attorney.

1423
01:17:24,690 --> 01:17:26,560
No. No.
This is something she said.

1424
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,980
- We don't have to do that.
- She told me I have to.

1425
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:31,190
- No, Jim.
- I do.

1426
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:32,990
Listen, I do--
if I don't get my money back--

1427
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:34,910
Roma,
I'm talking to you.

1428
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:38,870
Listen-- will someone
get this guy off my back, please?

1429
01:17:38,830 --> 01:17:42,160
- You have a problem?
- Yes, I have a problem!

1430
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,710
Yes, I do, my friend.
It is not me

1431
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:46,670
that ripped the joint off.
I'm doing business.

1432
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:50,340
I will be with you
in a while, got it?

1433
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:53,800
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

1434
01:17:56,050 --> 01:17:58,100
This is me!

1435
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:01,930
Jim, this is
Ricky, Jim.

1436
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:07,310
Jim, anything you want,
you want it, you got it.

1437
01:18:07,310 --> 01:18:09,820
Understand?
This is me.

1438
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:12,360
Something upset you.

1439
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:14,700
Yes.
Sit down now.

1440
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:18,700
Sit down.
You tell me what it is,

1441
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:22,120
am I gonna
help you fix it?

1442
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:24,250
You're goddamned
right I am.

1443
01:18:24,290 --> 01:18:26,830
Sit down.

1444
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:29,500
I'll tell you something,

1445
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:34,380
sometimes we need
someone from outside.

1446
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:39,930
Sit. Talk to me,
come on.

1447
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:46,810
I can't negotiate.

1448
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,150
What does that mean?

1449
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,940
What?

1450
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:57,860
What?
Say the words.

1451
01:18:57,910 --> 01:19:00,740
I don't have the power.

1452
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:02,870
Okay, I said it.

1453
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:06,370
- What power?
- To negotiate.

1454
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:08,420
To negotiate what?

1455
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:12,630
To negotiate what?

1456
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:14,550
This.

1457
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:16,720
- What this?
- The deal.

1458
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,680
The deal?

1459
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,720
Forget the deal, Jim.

1460
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,760
You got something on your mind,
what is it?

1461
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:26,560
What?

1462
01:19:28,810 --> 01:19:31,150
I can't talk to you.

1463
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:33,650
You met my wife.

1464
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:36,650
- What?
- Aw...

1465
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:40,990
I met your wife,
what?

1466
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,460
What, Jim?

1467
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:51,920
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, let's go.

1468
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,210
Get a drink,
come on.

1469
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:55,460
No, no, she told me
not to talk to you.

1470
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:57,470
Come on, we're gonna
go around the corner.

1471
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:59,050
We'll have a drink.
Who's gonna know?

1472
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:01,180
She told me to get
the check back, otherwise--

1473
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:03,300
Forget the deal, Jimmy.
Forget the deal.

1474
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:06,810
The deal is dead.
You know me, the deal's dead.

1475
01:20:06,850 --> 01:20:09,310
Am I talking
about the deal?

1476
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:11,690
That's over.

1477
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:14,480
Please--
let's talk about you.

1478
01:20:20,990 --> 01:20:23,780
I'm gonna tell you
something.

1479
01:20:23,870 --> 01:20:26,200
Your life is your own.

1480
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,210
You have a contract
with your wife,

1481
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:33,290
you have certain things
you do jointly,

1482
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:36,550
you have a bond there.
And there are other things,

1483
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:42,640
and those things are yours.
You needn't feel ashamed.

1484
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:45,300
You needn't feel
that you're being untrue

1485
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:49,560
or that she would
abandon you if she knew.

1486
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,810
This is your life.

1487
01:20:58,070 --> 01:20:59,940
Yes?

1488
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:06,120
Now, I want to talk to you
because you're obviously upset,

1489
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:09,160
and that concerns me.

1490
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,660
Let's go,
come on, right now.

1491
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:13,460
Let's go, come on.

1492
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,840
Roma.

1493
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,590
- What?
- The check, it's--

1494
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:22,260
What did I tell you?

1495
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:24,180
No, what did I tell you
about the three days?

1496
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:26,180
Roma, would you?
I'd like to get some lunch.

1497
01:21:26,510 --> 01:21:30,640
I am talking with Mr. Lingk,
if you please.

1498
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:34,650
I will be with you in a while.
Just check with Mr. Williamson.

1499
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:38,570
- People downtown said--
- Call them again. Mr. Williamson!

1500
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:40,650
Yes?

1501
01:21:40,690 --> 01:21:42,780
Mr. Lingk and I
are going to go to the--

1502
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:45,610
Oh, yes, please.
The police can be--

1503
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:48,280
- What are the police doing here?
- It's nothing.

1504
01:21:48,330 --> 01:21:52,160
- What are the police doing here?
- We had a slight burglary last night.

1505
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:54,370
It's nothing,
I was just assuring Mr. Lingk.

1506
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:56,880
Mr. Lingk? James Lingk?
Your contract went out.

1507
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,790
- Nothing to worry about.
- John, John--

1508
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,670
- Your contract went out to the bank.
- You cashed my check?

1509
01:22:00,710 --> 01:22:02,670
- Mr. Williamson--
- The check was cashed.

1510
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:05,380
The contract was filed
and deposited in the bank,

1511
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:07,890
and we're completely insured
in any case, as you know.

1512
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:12,020
- You cashed the check?
- Not to my knowledge, no.

1513
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,890
- Though I'm sure we can--
- Not to my knowledge.

1514
01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:18,310
Christ! I--
Oh, Christ.

1515
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:20,780
Don't follow me,
just don't follow me, okay?

1516
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,030
I've let you down.
I know I've let you down.

1517
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:29,370
I'm sorry, forgive me. I-I--

1518
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:33,500
I don't--
I don't know anymore.

1519
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:39,630
I... forgive me.

1520
01:22:53,770 --> 01:22:56,560
You stupid fucking cunt.

1521
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:00,110
You, Williamson,
I'm talking to you, shithead.

1522
01:23:00,110 --> 01:23:02,820
You just cost me
$6,000.

1523
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:09,410
$6,000, and one Cadillac.
That's right.

1524
01:23:09,490 --> 01:23:11,830
What are you gonna
do about it?

1525
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:16,460
What are you
gonna do about it, asshole?

1526
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,460
You're fucking shit.

1527
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:20,960
Where did you
learn your trade,

1528
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,840
you stupid fucking cunt,
you idiot?

1529
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:26,300
Who ever told you
that you could work with men?

1530
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:27,760
Could I...?

1531
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:30,300
Oh, I'm gonna have
your job, shithead.

1532
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:33,140
I'm going downtown.
I'm gonna talk to Mitch and Murray.

1533
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:37,180
I'm going to Lemkin!
I don't care whose nephew you are,

1534
01:23:37,230 --> 01:23:40,270
who you know,
whose dick you're sucking on,

1535
01:23:40,310 --> 01:23:42,690
you're going out.
I swear to you--

1536
01:23:42,730 --> 01:23:45,440
Hey, fella,
let's get this done.

1537
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:50,910
Anyone in this office
lives on his wits--

1538
01:23:50,950 --> 01:23:53,700
I'm gonna be with you
in a second.

1539
01:23:56,410 --> 01:24:00,080
What you're hired for
is to help us.

1540
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:02,960
Does that seem
clear to you?

1541
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:07,880
To help us!
Not to fuck us up!

1542
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:11,180
To help men who are
going out there

1543
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:14,680
to try to earn a living,
you fairy.

1544
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,520
You company man.

1545
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:19,600
I'll tell you something else,
I hope you ripped the joint off.

1546
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:23,190
I can tell our friend here something,
might help him to catch you.

1547
01:24:28,150 --> 01:24:30,530
You wanna learn
the first rule

1548
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:33,620
you'd know if you ever
spent a day in your life?

1549
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:39,040
You never open your mouth
till you know what the shot is.

1550
01:24:40,870 --> 01:24:43,630
You fucking child.

1551
01:24:55,810 --> 01:24:58,980
You are a shithead,
Williamson.

1552
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:03,980
Can't think on your feet,
you ought to keep your mouth closed.

1553
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:07,230
Can you hear me?
I'm talking to you.

1554
01:25:07,230 --> 01:25:09,110
Yes, I hear you.

1555
01:25:09,190 --> 01:25:12,320
Ricky's right. Can't learn in an office,
gotta learn it in the street.

1556
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:14,660
And you sure can't buy it,
you gotta live it.

1557
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:16,660
- Mmmm.
- "Mmmm," yeah!

1558
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:20,000
Precisely.
Because your partner depends--

1559
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,000
I'm talking to you,
trying to tell you something!

1560
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,120
- You are?
- Yeah, I am.

1561
01:25:23,210 --> 01:25:25,630
- What are you trying to tell me?
- What Roma was trying to tell you.

1562
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:29,050
What I told you a long time ago.
You don't belong in this business.

1563
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:31,380
You might listen to me.
One day you could say,

1564
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:33,130
"Hey, maybe the guy--"
oh, fuck it.

1565
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:36,260
Listen to me now.
Your partner depends on you.

1566
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:38,850
The man who is your partner,
depends on you.

1567
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:41,890
You go with him
and for him or you're shit!

1568
01:25:41,930 --> 01:25:44,190
You are shit--
you can't exist alone.

1569
01:25:44,230 --> 01:25:46,150
- Excuse me.
- "Excuse you," nothing!

1570
01:25:46,110 --> 01:25:49,280
You be as cold as you want.
You just fucked a good man

1571
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:51,440
out of $6,000
and his goddamned bonus

1572
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:53,570
because you didn't
know the shot.

1573
01:25:53,610 --> 01:25:55,990
You can do that and you're not
man enough to say it gets you?

1574
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:58,950
I don't know what--
if you can't take something from that,

1575
01:25:58,990 --> 01:26:01,870
then you're-- scum!
You're fucking white bread.

1576
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:04,960
A child would know it,
he's right.

1577
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,290
If you're gonna make something up,
be sure that it helps.

1578
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:11,300
Hmm?
Or keep your mouth shut.

1579
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:14,180
I'm done with you.

1580
01:26:26,650 --> 01:26:28,310
How do you know
I made it up?

1581
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:30,690
What?

1582
01:26:30,730 --> 01:26:33,690
How do you know
I made it up?

1583
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:36,320
What are you
talking about, huh?

1584
01:26:38,910 --> 01:26:41,990
You said, "Don't make something up
unless it's sure to help."

1585
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:48,670
- How did you know I made it up?
- What are you talking about?

1586
01:26:55,930 --> 01:26:58,720
I told the customer his contract
had gone to the bank.

1587
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:01,010
Yeah. Well, hadn't it?

1588
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,690
No, it hadn't.

1589
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:10,940
Don't fuck with me.

1590
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:13,440
Don't fuck with me!
What are you getting at?

1591
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:16,280
I'm saying this, Shelly...

1592
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:21,410
usually I take
the contracts to the bank,

1593
01:27:21,490 --> 01:27:23,740
last night I didn't.

1594
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:28,290
Last night I stayed home
with my kids.

1595
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:32,670
How did you know that?

1596
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:39,550
One night in a year,
I left a contract on my desk.

1597
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:42,050
No one knew that but you.

1598
01:27:43,310 --> 01:27:45,140
Now, how did you know that?

1599
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:48,770
You want to talk to me or you
want to talk to someone else?

1600
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:50,310
Because this is my job!

1601
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:54,280
This is my job on the line
and you are gonna talk to me!

1602
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:57,320
Now how did you know
that contract was on my desk?

1603
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:59,990
You are so full of shit!

1604
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:02,370
- You robbed the office.
- Oh, sure, I robbed the office.

1605
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:04,580
Oh sure! You asshole.

1606
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:06,450
What did you do
with the leads?

1607
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:09,290
You wanna go in there?
I tell him what I know,

1608
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:11,960
he's gonna dig up something.
You got an alibi last night?

1609
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,460
You better have one!
What did you do with the leads?

1610
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:18,670
If you tell me what you did
with the leads, we can talk.

1611
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:21,090
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

1612
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:23,510
If you tell me where the leads are,
I won't turn you in.

1613
01:28:23,550 --> 01:28:25,970
If you don't, I'm gonna tell
the cop you stole them.

1614
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:29,190
Mitch and Murray will see that you
go to jail, believe me, they will!

1615
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:30,690
Now, where are the leads?

1616
01:28:30,730 --> 01:28:32,810
I'm walking in that door.
You got five seconds

1617
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:34,520
- or you are going to jail!
- Go ahead.

1618
01:28:34,570 --> 01:28:37,070
I don't care,
you understand?

1619
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:40,820
Where are the leads?

1620
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:44,330
All right.

1621
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:48,250
I sold them.

1622
01:28:57,170 --> 01:28:59,720
To Jerry Graff.

1623
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,090
How much did you
get for them?

1624
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:04,010
How much did
you get for them?

1625
01:29:04,050 --> 01:29:06,430
Five.
Five grand.

1626
01:29:06,470 --> 01:29:09,350
- I got half.
- Who got the other half?

1627
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:11,440
Do I have to tell you?

1628
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:14,020
Moss.

1629
01:29:17,610 --> 01:29:19,650
Well, that was easy,
wasn't it?

1630
01:29:19,690 --> 01:29:22,240
- His idea.
- Was it?

1631
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:24,570
I think he got
more than five, actually.

1632
01:29:24,570 --> 01:29:27,950
- Uh-huh.
- He told me my cut was 2500.

1633
01:29:27,950 --> 01:29:30,250
Mmm.

1634
01:29:31,790 --> 01:29:33,460
Wait a minute.
Okay-- hey, hey, John!

1635
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:36,710
Wait-- okay, John!
Hey, Johnny.

1636
01:29:36,790 --> 01:29:40,300
Listen.
Come here, come here.

1637
01:29:42,430 --> 01:29:44,260
Eh, John?

1638
01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:46,550
Last night...

1639
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:49,310
I gotta tell you,
I'm ready to "do the Dutch."

1640
01:29:49,310 --> 01:29:52,310
I'm done. Moss gets me,
"Do this, we'll get well."

1641
01:29:52,310 --> 01:29:55,650
Why not? Big fucking deal.
I'm halfway hoping to get caught.

1642
01:29:55,690 --> 01:29:59,860
Hey-- put me out of my misery.
It taught me something, John.

1643
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:02,450
What it taught me--
you gotta get out there!

1644
01:30:02,450 --> 01:30:05,870
I'm not cut out to be a thief,
I'm cut out to be a salesman.

1645
01:30:05,950 --> 01:30:08,700
And I am back.
I got my balls back.

1646
01:30:08,830 --> 01:30:12,750
Now... you got a slight
advantage on me.

1647
01:30:12,830 --> 01:30:15,460
But whatever it takes, John,

1648
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:18,040
to make things right,
we're gonna make it right.

1649
01:30:18,130 --> 01:30:20,710
We are going
to make it right.

1650
01:30:24,130 --> 01:30:25,930
I want to tell you
something, Shelly.

1651
01:30:25,970 --> 01:30:29,680
- Eh?
- You have a big mouth.

1652
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:32,310
What?

1653
01:30:32,310 --> 01:30:34,060
You've got a big mouth!

1654
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:36,900
And now I'm gonna show you
an even bigger one.

1655
01:30:36,850 --> 01:30:38,770
Where are you going?

1656
01:30:38,860 --> 01:30:41,610
You can't do that!
You don't want to do that.

1657
01:30:41,610 --> 01:30:43,900
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1658
01:30:45,610 --> 01:30:49,200
It's $2,500. Go ahead
and take it, take it all.

1659
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:51,620
No, I don't think so.
I don't think I want your money.

1660
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:54,620
I think you fucked up my office,
and I think you're going away.

1661
01:30:54,580 --> 01:30:58,630
Are you nuts?
I'm gonna close for you! Take--

1662
01:30:58,580 --> 01:31:02,090
I'm gonna make this office and be
number one on that board again.

1663
01:31:02,090 --> 01:31:04,420
Wait, John.

1664
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:08,010
John-- okay.

1665
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:15,230
This is what
we're gonna do-- 20%.

1666
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:18,440
I'm gonna give you 20%
of all my sales.

1667
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:21,440
20%, as long as I'm
with this firm.

1668
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:23,530
50.

1669
01:31:23,610 --> 01:31:28,110
- 50%of all my sales.
- What sales?

1670
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:30,280
What sales? My God,
I just closed 82 grand.

1671
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:33,540
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I'm back! This is just the beginning!

1672
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:36,040
Just the beginning?
Where have you been, Shelly?

1673
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:39,130
Bruce and Harriett Nyborg--
do you want to see the memos?

1674
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:42,710
They're nuts.
They used to call in every week--

1675
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:45,340
when I was with Webb--
we were selling Arizona.

1676
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:47,470
They're nuts.

1677
01:31:47,510 --> 01:31:52,970
Did you see how they were living?
How can you delude yourself?

1678
01:31:52,930 --> 01:31:54,970
- I've got their check.
- Forget it. Frame it.

1679
01:31:54,970 --> 01:31:57,270
- It's worthless.
- The check is no good?

1680
01:31:57,230 --> 01:31:59,650
You want to stick around?
I'll pull the memo. I'm busy.

1681
01:31:59,690 --> 01:32:01,610
The check is no good?
They're nuts?

1682
01:32:01,650 --> 01:32:03,570
You want to call the bank?
I called them.

1683
01:32:03,570 --> 01:32:07,280
I called them four months ago
when we first got the lead.

1684
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:10,160
The people are insane.

1685
01:32:11,530 --> 01:32:14,990
They just like talking
to salesmen.

1686
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:24,300
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

1687
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:30,800
- Why?
- Because I don't like you.

1688
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:39,600
My daughter.

1689
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,810
Fuck you.

1690
01:32:56,990 --> 01:32:59,410
Asshole.

1691
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:02,670
Guy couldn't find his fucking couch
in the living room.

1692
01:33:04,790 --> 01:33:07,210
What a day.

1693
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:09,300
Whoo...

1694
01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:11,800
I haven't even had
a cup of coffee.

1695
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:19,020
Jag-off John opens his mouth,
blows my Cadillac.

1696
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:25,110
I swear,
it's not a world of men.

1697
01:33:27,610 --> 01:33:30,320
It is not
a world of men, "Machine."

1698
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:33,240
- Huh?
- It's a world of clock-watchers...

1699
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:35,870
bureaucrats...

1700
01:33:35,910 --> 01:33:38,700
officeholders, what it is.

1701
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:42,040
It's a fucked-up world.

1702
01:33:44,330 --> 01:33:46,380
No adventure to it.

1703
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:50,720
Dying breed.
Yes, it is.

1704
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:56,140
We're the members of a dying breed.
That's-- that's--

1705
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:59,970
that's why we got
to stick together. Shel?

1706
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:02,440
- Huh?
- I want to talk to you.

1707
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:04,770
I've wanted to talk to you
for some time--

1708
01:34:04,810 --> 01:34:08,730
for a long time, actually.
I said, "The Machine"--

1709
01:34:08,820 --> 01:34:12,280
there's a man
I would work with.

1710
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:16,030
There's--" you know,
I never said a word.

1711
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:19,040
I don't know why I didn't.
I should've, I don't know why.

1712
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:22,910
And that shit you were slinging
on my guy today--

1713
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:27,170
that was so good.
That-- it--

1714
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:30,050
excuse me for saying this,
it's not even my place to say it.

1715
01:34:30,050 --> 01:34:32,670
That was admirable.

1716
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:35,470
It was the old stuff.

1717
01:34:35,430 --> 01:34:39,060
Hey, I've been
on a hot streak.

1718
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:42,890
So what?
Things I can learn from you.

1719
01:34:44,890 --> 01:34:47,100
- You eat today?
- Me?

1720
01:34:47,150 --> 01:34:48,690
Yeah.

1721
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:52,110
Want to swing around the Chinks'--
watch me eat, we'll talk?

1722
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:54,530
I think
I'll stay around awhile.

1723
01:34:54,570 --> 01:34:56,610
Hello, Mrs. Schwartz?

1724
01:34:56,570 --> 01:34:58,780
This is Richard Roma
with Premiere Properties.

1725
01:34:58,740 --> 01:35:01,790
You or your accountant requested
information on a land investment

1726
01:35:01,740 --> 01:35:04,410
which would offer you
depreciation and the chance

1727
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:06,670
of a substantial return
on a small investment.

1728
01:35:06,750 --> 01:35:09,210
I'm in from Florida
just for one day...

1729
01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:13,090
- Mr. Levene?
- ...so I only have that one lot left.

1730
01:35:13,090 --> 01:35:14,970
Would you come in here,
please?

1731
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:17,430
I don't have too much time
and I'm on the midnight plane back,

1732
01:35:17,470 --> 01:35:19,970
so if you or your husband
are truly interested--

1733
01:35:19,930 --> 01:35:22,520
because I can't hold
this parcel past--

1734
01:35:22,470 --> 01:35:25,100
Yes?

1735
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:28,100
Well, what would be better
for you-- say, 6:00 or 8:00?

1736
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:33,650
Go ask him. Shel-- we're gonna talk?
I'm going to the Chinks'.

1737
01:35:33,650 --> 01:35:35,650
When you're done, come down.
We're gonna smoke a cigarette.

1738
01:35:35,650 --> 01:35:37,820
- I...
- Get in the room.

1739
01:35:37,910 --> 01:35:41,830
Hey. Hey, easy, pal.
That's "The Machine."

1740
01:35:41,830 --> 01:35:44,950
This is Shelly
"The Machine" Levene.

1741
01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:47,330
- Get in the goddamn room.
- Rick, I...

1742
01:35:47,370 --> 01:35:49,580
- I'll meet you at the restaurant.
- Ricky--

1743
01:35:49,630 --> 01:35:51,540
- Ricky can't help you.
- All I want is--

1744
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:53,630
What do you want?
You want to what?

1745
01:35:53,670 --> 01:35:57,630
- Rick? Rick?
- Hello? Excellent.

1746
01:36:03,810 --> 01:36:03,890
8:00 p.m.
6947 Euclid.

1747
01:36:03,930 --> 01:36:06,680
Not at all--
thank you very much.

1748
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:20,610
They find the guy
that broke in the office?

1749
01:36:20,660 --> 01:36:23,870
No. I don't know.

1750
01:36:28,660 --> 01:36:30,790
Did the leads
come in yet?

1751
01:36:30,830 --> 01:36:33,340
No.

1752
01:36:41,180 --> 01:36:43,510
Oh God,
I hate this job.

1753
01:36:43,550 --> 01:36:45,680
Anybody wants me,
I'm at the restaurant.

1754
01:36:51,190 --> 01:36:54,070
Hello, Mrs. Delgari?

1755
01:36:54,070 --> 01:36:57,360
Yes-- you requested some information
about Rio Rancho Properties?

1756
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:02,200
# Blue skies smiling at me #

1757
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:07,540
# Nothing but blue skies
do I see #

1758
01:37:07,580 --> 01:37:10,620
# In the morning
there's bluebirds #

1759
01:37:10,670 --> 01:37:13,670
# Singing a song #

1760
01:37:13,670 --> 01:37:16,670
# Nothing but bluebirds #

1761
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:19,670
# From now on #

1762
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:22,930
# I never saw the sun
shining so bright #

1763
01:37:22,930 --> 01:37:25,720
# Never saw things
going so right #

1764
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,720
# Noticing the days
hurrying by #

1765
01:37:28,770 --> 01:37:32,270
# When you're in love,
my, how they fly #

1766
01:37:32,310 --> 01:37:36,690
# Blue days,
all of them gone #

1767
01:37:36,770 --> 01:37:41,820
# Nothing but blue skies
from now on... #

1768
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:31,950
# Blue skies
smiling at me #

1769
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:37,710
# Nothing but blue skies
do I see #

1770
01:38:37,710 --> 01:38:40,170
# In the morning
there's bluebirds #

1771
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:43,300
# Singing a song #

1772
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:48,300
# Nothing but, nothing but
bluebirds from now on #

1773
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:50,770
# Let me tell you
I never saw the sun #

1774
01:38:50,770 --> 01:38:52,350
# Shining so bright #

1775
01:38:52,430 --> 01:38:55,310
# Never saw things
going so right #

1776
01:38:55,310 --> 01:38:58,110
# Noticing the days
hurrying by #

1777
01:38:58,150 --> 01:39:01,190
# When you're in love,
my, how they fly #

1778
01:39:01,190 --> 01:39:05,910
# Blue skies
smiling at me #

1779
01:39:05,910 --> 01:39:11,200
# Nothing but blue skies
do I see #

1780
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:13,500
# In the morning
there's bluebirds #

1781
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:16,960
# Singing a song #

1782
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:21,800
# Nothing but, nothing but
bluebirds from now on #

1783
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:24,260
# Let me tell you
I never saw the sun #

1784
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:26,130
# Shining so bright #

1785
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:28,720
# Never saw things
going so right #

1786
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:31,680
# Noticing the days
hurrying by #

1787
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:34,390
# When you're in love,
my how they fly #

1788
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:37,560
# Blue days #

1789
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:40,110
# All of them,
all of them gone #

1790
01:39:40,110 --> 01:39:44,990
# Nothing but blue skies
from now on #

1791
01:39:45,070 --> 01:39:50,530
# Nothing but blue skies
from now on #

1792
01:39:50,570 --> 01:39:56,370
# Nothing but blue skies
from now on #

1793
01:39:56,410 --> 01:39:59,290
# Now on #

1794
01:39:59,290 --> 01:40:07,550
# Nothing but blue skies. #
