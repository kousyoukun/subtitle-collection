2
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:37,214
2306, please.

3
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:43,086
Hello, honey.
How you doing?

4
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:47,030
Good.
What did he say?

5
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:51,661
Uh-huh. Is he still there?
How long ago did he leave?

6
00:02:51,737 --> 00:02:55,639
Uh-huh. I'm stopping here,
then I got a little meeting,

7
00:02:55,707 --> 00:02:58,335
and then I'll...
I would if I could.

8
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,538
As soon as I can.
Let me get off and l...

9
00:03:01,613 --> 00:03:05,845
let me get off and I prom...
I promise you it'll be okay.

10
00:03:07,653 --> 00:03:11,714
A bunch of bullshit.
Waste a good man's time.

11
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:22,000
Hi, could I speak
to Dr. Lowenstein, please?

12
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:24,695
It's rather important.
Could you get him for me?

13
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,466
Bunch of bullshit trying to make
a living on these deadbeat leads.

14
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:29,973
I swear to God, Shel,
I'm on a sit today...

15
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:33,307
Hello, Mrs. Swoboda,
this is Dave Moss.

16
00:03:33,378 --> 00:03:35,369
Yeah, we spoke yesterday.

17
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:39,213
Now on the Rio Rancho Estates,
we've had a situation just come up.

18
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:41,878
The president of our company
is in town just one day,

19
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:44,252
- and he has certain parcels...
- Doctor...

20
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:47,349
well, could you get...
what do you mean?

21
00:03:47,426 --> 00:03:50,156
He's not there?
I have to speak to him.

22
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:54,165
Yes, it is fairly urgent.
Mr. Levene.

23
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:58,499
No, I can't be reached.
I'll get back to him.

24
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,765
He has certain parcels...
certain choice parcels

25
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:03,330
which he's given me
a hold on for the next 48 hours.

26
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:06,343
What would be the best time to get
you and your husband together?

27
00:04:06,411 --> 00:04:11,405
Say, tonight, at 10:00,
or tomorrow at 8:00?

28
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,941
Okay.

29
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:16,613
Okay, what would be
the best time to do that?

30
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:21,982
Look, you sent in the...
no, no, listen to me now...

31
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,790
I've got 48 hours
to make you a lot of money.

32
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:30,531
Well, when will he be home?
Fine, I'll call you back in 10 minutes.

33
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:34,765
They don't give you the leads,
they don't give you the support,

34
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,671
- they don't give you dick.
- Yeah.

35
00:04:36,742 --> 00:04:38,733
Then they're yanking us in
on some sales conference.

36
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:41,905
When's the last time anybody
learned a goddamn thing?

37
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:44,347
All it does is some jerk
shoots his mouth off.

38
00:04:46,084 --> 00:04:49,451
I swear to God, Shel, I got half a mind
to go across the street.

39
00:04:49,521 --> 00:04:52,012
I got half a mind to go
with you if they'd take me.

40
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:56,254
You never know... I was talking
to Jerry Graff last week.

41
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,490
I got to call
these deadbeats back.

42
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,795
I can't make a goddamn
dollar with these leads,

43
00:05:03,835 --> 00:05:05,700
and you're killing my ass
on the street.

44
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:08,103
- I'm sorry you aren't happy here.
- That's cute,

45
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:10,664
but you're running this office
like a bunch of bullshit.

46
00:05:10,742 --> 00:05:12,869
You're on an override...
you make money, we make money.

47
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:15,971
- I'd like you to make more money.
- Then don't go waste my time.

48
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:18,744
- A sales conference?
- The strategy comes from downtown.

49
00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:21,082
Oh, the strategy?
The strategy?

50
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:23,178
- Well, I think I'll pass.
- I wouldn't.

51
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:26,122
- Why is that?
- When you come, then you'll see.

52
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:29,251
- Shelly.
- John.

53
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:31,387
Are you ready
to do or die tonight?

54
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:33,397
Oh yeah,
always ready, John.

55
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:35,797
Always ready, John.
Now, one thing...

56
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:37,835
we were talking about the leads.
We got some new ones?

57
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:40,167
That's what we're going
to talk about at the meeting.

58
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,673
We are? Because I'm running
into a bit of a snag.

59
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:44,504
Yes, I've seen
your sales figures.

60
00:05:44,576 --> 00:05:46,635
That's the leads.
You give me a better lead...

61
00:05:46,712 --> 00:05:48,771
That's what we're going
to be talking about.

62
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:50,644
I'm in a bind...
personal problems.

63
00:05:50,716 --> 00:05:52,513
- I could use a leg up.
- After the meeting.

64
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:55,748
- I hear the new Glengarry leads...
- After the meeting, Shel.

65
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:57,755
- Hey, Ricky.
- Hello, John.

66
00:05:57,823 --> 00:06:00,383
- Wet out there tonight.
- Huh?

67
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:04,953
- Wet out there tonight.
- Uh-huh.

68
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,191
- Maybe it'll break the heat.
- Yeah.

69
00:06:10,802 --> 00:06:14,033
Al, give me a quick J&B, huh?
Double.

70
00:06:14,106 --> 00:06:15,869
Cutty, Al.

71
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:21,469
- They say...
- Huh?

72
00:06:21,546 --> 00:06:25,312
They say it was so hot
downtown this afternoon,

73
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:29,878
grown men on the street corner
were going up to cops

74
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:32,651
begging the cops
to shoot them.

75
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:37,525
They say you should not drink
alcohol when it's so hot.

76
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:41,862
- Who says that?
- Something I read.

77
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:45,266
For they say
it dehydrates you.

78
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:48,170
They say
you should drink water,

79
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,404
but I subscribe to the law
of contrary public opinion.

80
00:06:53,345 --> 00:06:56,837
If everyone thinks one thing,
then I say bet the other way.

81
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,051
Added to which,
you know they're wrong.

82
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:02,586
That's what I'm saying.

83
00:07:06,224 --> 00:07:09,216
- Slow tonight.
- Oh, yeah.

84
00:07:09,294 --> 00:07:11,387
Well, I guess
everybody's staying home.

85
00:07:11,463 --> 00:07:13,761
If my daughter calls,
anybody calls,

86
00:07:13,832 --> 00:07:17,393
I'm over at the office.
Thanks.

87
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:52,831
I had a woman
in White Plains on the hook...

88
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:55,873
five units, Mountain View...
what happens?

89
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:57,772
She has to check
with her lawyer.

90
00:07:57,843 --> 00:08:00,403
- You let her check with her lawyer?
- What could I do?

91
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,004
- I dunno.
- Shelly.

92
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:05,174
- Huh?
- Who's the guy?

93
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,184
Couldn't tell you.

94
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:10,949
I don't like the whole thing,
because all I need is a lead.

95
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:12,751
- They won't give out...
- Uh-huh.

96
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:15,418
The rich get richer,
that's the law of the land.

97
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:17,655
Who belongs
to the BM...?

98
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:24,766
It is 7:30.

99
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:26,997
So who is that?

100
00:08:28,073 --> 00:08:30,007
And where is
Mr. Roma?

101
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:31,736
Well, I'm not a leash,
so I don't know, do I?

102
00:08:32,878 --> 00:08:36,871
Let me have
your attention for a moment.

103
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:40,179
You're talking about what?
You're talking about...

104
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:43,612
bitching about
that sale you shot,

105
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:45,883
some son of a bitch
don't want to buy land,

106
00:08:45,957 --> 00:08:47,322
somebody don't want
what you're selling,

107
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,327
some broad you're
trying to screw, so forth.

108
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:51,454
Let's talk
about something important.

109
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,157
- Are they all here?
- All but one.

110
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:54,187
I'm going anyway.

111
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:57,793
Let's talk
about something important.

112
00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:00,235
Put that coffee down.

113
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:07,812
Coffee's for closers only.

114
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:12,716
You think
I'm fucking with you?

115
00:09:16,154 --> 00:09:17,951
I am not fucking with you.

116
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,885
I'm here from downtown.

117
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,517
I'm here
from Mitch and Murray.

118
00:09:22,594 --> 00:09:25,757
And I'm here
on a mission of mercy.

119
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:33,160
- Your name's Levene?
- Yeah.

120
00:09:33,238 --> 00:09:37,038
You call yourself a salesman,
you son of a bitch?

121
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:38,837
I don't got to listen
to this shit.

122
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,175
You certainly don't, 'cause
the good news is, you're fired.

123
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:46,713
The bad news is you've got...
all of you've got...

124
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:48,776
just one week
to regain your jobs,

125
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:52,312
starting with tonight...
starting with tonight's sit.

126
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:58,192
Oh, have I got
your attention now?

127
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:02,126
Good...

128
00:10:03,702 --> 00:10:05,294
'cause we're adding
a little something

129
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,031
to this month's
sales contest.

130
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:10,165
As you all know, first prize
is a Cadillac Eldorado.

131
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,267
Anybody want to see
second prize?

132
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:15,780
Second prize is
a set of steak knives.

133
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:20,648
Third prize is you're fired.

134
00:10:24,422 --> 00:10:28,085
Do you get the picture?
Are you laughing now?

135
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,562
You got leads. Mitch and Murray
paid good money.

136
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:34,792
Get their names
to sell them.

137
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:36,891
You can't close
the leads you're given,

138
00:10:36,968 --> 00:10:39,630
you can't close shit,
you are shit!

139
00:10:39,704 --> 00:10:43,231
Hit the bricks, pal, and beat it,
'cause you are going out!

140
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:46,766
- The leads are weak.
- The leads are weak?

141
00:10:46,845 --> 00:10:49,575
The fucking leads are weak?
You're weak.

142
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:51,616
I've been
in this business 15 years.

143
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:53,981
- What's your name?
- Fuck you...

144
00:10:54,052 --> 00:10:56,577
that's my name!
You know why, mister?

145
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:58,782
Because you drove a Hyundai
to get here tonight,

146
00:10:58,857 --> 00:11:03,760
I drove an $80,000 BMW.
That's my name.

147
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:11,093
And your name
is "You're wanting."

148
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:14,332
You can't play in the man's game?
You can't close them?

149
00:11:14,406 --> 00:11:17,773
Then go home and tell your wife
your troubles.

150
00:11:18,843 --> 00:11:21,607
Because only one thing
counts in this life...

151
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,047
get them to sign
on the line which is dotted!

152
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:28,051
You hear me,
you fucking faggots?

153
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,727
"A-B-C."

154
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:40,788
A... Always,
B... Be, C... Closing.

155
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:42,799
Always Be Closing.

156
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:46,530
"Always Be Closing."

157
00:11:47,472 --> 00:11:49,269
"A-l-D-A."

158
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:52,037
"Attention, Interest,
Decision, Action."

159
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,578
Attention...
Do I have your attention?

160
00:11:54,646 --> 00:11:56,773
Interest...
Are you interested?

161
00:11:56,848 --> 00:11:59,112
I know you are,
because it's fuck or walk.

162
00:11:59,184 --> 00:12:01,175
You close
or you hit the bricks.

163
00:12:01,252 --> 00:12:05,484
Decision... Have you made
your decision for Christ?

164
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:10,221
And Action.
"A-l-D-A."

165
00:12:10,295 --> 00:12:12,593
Get out there...
you got the prospects coming in.

166
00:12:12,664 --> 00:12:14,825
You think they came in
to get out of the rain?

167
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:17,299
A guy don't walk on the lot
lest he wants to buy.

168
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,668
They're sitting out there
waiting to give you their money.

169
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,764
Are you gonna take it?

170
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:25,969
Are you man enough
to take it?

171
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:34,409
Crap.

172
00:12:34,486 --> 00:12:36,386
What's the problem, pal?
You... Moss.

173
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:38,922
You're such a hero,
you're so rich,

174
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,255
how come you're here wasting
your time with a bunch of bums?

175
00:12:44,496 --> 00:12:46,896
You see this watch?

176
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:53,300
- You see this watch?
- Yeah.

177
00:12:53,371 --> 00:12:56,568
That watch costs
more than your car.

178
00:12:56,641 --> 00:13:00,702
I made $970,000 last year.
How much you make?

179
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:08,118
You see, pal... that's who I am,
and you're nothing.

180
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:12,054
Nice guy?
I don't give a shit.

181
00:13:12,123 --> 00:13:16,116
Good father? Fuck you...
go home and play with your kids.

182
00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:20,722
You want to work here...
close!

183
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,064
You think this is abuse?

184
00:13:24,135 --> 00:13:26,194
You think this is abuse,
you cocksucker?

185
00:13:26,271 --> 00:13:29,934
You can't take this, how can you
take the abuse you get on a sit?

186
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:34,501
You don't like it, leave.

187
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:39,882
I can go out there tonight...
the materials you got...

188
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:44,047
make myself $15,000.
Tonight... in two hours!

189
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:45,953
Can you?

190
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:49,721
Can you?

191
00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:54,689
Go and do likewise.
"A-l-D-A."

192
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:57,360
Get mad, you son of a bitches.
Get mad!

193
00:13:57,435 --> 00:14:01,371
You know what it takes
to sell real estate?

194
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:05,136
It takes brass balls
to sell real estate.

195
00:14:09,814 --> 00:14:12,476
Go and do likewise,
gents.

196
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,950
The money's out there...
you pick it up, it's yours,

197
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:17,317
you don't,
I got no sympathy for you.

198
00:14:17,388 --> 00:14:19,219
You want to go out
on those sits tonight and close...

199
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,019
close... it's yours.

200
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:23,253
Not, you're gonna be
shining my shoes.

201
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:26,058
And you know
what you'll be saying.

202
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,759
Bunch of losers
sitting around in a bar,

203
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:32,929
"Oh yeah, I used to be a salesman.
It's a tough racket."

204
00:14:41,646 --> 00:14:44,080
These are the new leads.

205
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,209
These are
the Glengarry leads.

206
00:14:47,285 --> 00:14:51,984
And to you, they're gold.
And you don't get them.

207
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:54,820
Why?

208
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:58,886
Because to give them to you
is just throwing them away.

209
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:05,335
They're for closers.

210
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:12,671
I'd wish you good luck,

211
00:15:12,744 --> 00:15:15,008
but you wouldn't know what
to do with it if you got it.

212
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:24,180
And to answer your question, pal...
"Why am I here?"

213
00:15:24,255 --> 00:15:27,224
I came here because
Mitch and Murray asked me to.

214
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:29,988
They asked me for a favor.
I said, "The real favor...

215
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:33,053
follow my advice
and fire your fucking ass,

216
00:15:33,131 --> 00:15:35,622
because a loser
is a loser."

217
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,237
Bunch of fucking nonsense...

218
00:15:49,314 --> 00:15:52,010
treat people like that.

219
00:15:53,718 --> 00:15:56,744
The fuck is he going
to get off?

220
00:15:56,821 --> 00:16:00,188
- Mickey Mouse sales conference.
- He didn't mean it.

221
00:16:00,258 --> 00:16:03,125
I'm sure he didn't mean it about
trimming down the sales quota.

222
00:16:03,194 --> 00:16:05,389
Where is Roma?
Where the hell is Mr. Ricky Roma?

223
00:16:05,463 --> 00:16:07,829
All the while we got to sit here,
eat this nonsense?

224
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:11,027
Hello? Mr. Levene.
How's she doing?

225
00:16:11,102 --> 00:16:13,093
Uh-huh, yeah.
Is she awake?

226
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:15,696
Oh, the doctor came by.
What did he say?

227
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:19,334
Uh-huh.
I can't come in tonight.

228
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,174
I think... I know she is.
I know that she is.

229
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:26,115
I've gotta go out. Will you please
tell her when she wakes?

230
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:30,143
I've got to go out.
Tell her I'll call her from the road.

231
00:16:30,221 --> 00:16:31,813
Thank you.

232
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,219
Gentlemen,
you heard the man.

233
00:16:37,295 --> 00:16:39,092
What is this in aid of?

234
00:16:39,163 --> 00:16:41,256
- As of tonight...
- What is this? Excuse me.

235
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:43,493
What it's in aid of
is that Mitch and Murray...

236
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:46,298
Fuck Mitch and Murray!
I'm doing my job,

237
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:48,168
I got to put up
with this childishness?

238
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:50,104
I don't make the rules.
I'm paid to run the office.

239
00:16:50,174 --> 00:16:52,540
You don't like the rules, Dave?
There's the door!

240
00:16:54,545 --> 00:16:59,039
Two lead cards for tonight,
two lead cards for tomorrow.

241
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:00,846
As you heard,
end of the month,

242
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,012
top salesman on the board
gets the Eldorado.

243
00:17:03,087 --> 00:17:05,214
- Next man down the...
- What about the good leads?

244
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,656
- The leads I've given you.
- But these leads are shit.

245
00:17:07,725 --> 00:17:09,556
They're old...
I've seen that name 100 times.

246
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:12,791
- The leads are assigned randomly.
- What about the new leads?

247
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:14,661
The new leads...
the Glengarry leads.

248
00:17:14,732 --> 00:17:17,064
I've got them.
I'm going to hang onto them.

249
00:17:17,135 --> 00:17:19,228
And they'll be
assigned to closers,

250
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,670
based on the sales volume,
first to Roma.

251
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:23,673
- Where is Roma?
- Don't worry about Roma.

252
00:17:23,741 --> 00:17:25,368
He'll get his leads,
you've got yours.

253
00:17:25,443 --> 00:17:27,570
He's top name on the board,
so he don't have to be here?

254
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:30,136
That's correct!
And as the hour is waning,

255
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:33,047
I suggest you... those of you
who are interested

256
00:17:33,117 --> 00:17:35,915
in a continuing job with
this organization, get to work.

257
00:17:35,987 --> 00:17:38,012
That's garbage.
Bullshit.

258
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:39,784
- Thank you for your attention.
- Bullshit!

259
00:17:39,857 --> 00:17:43,987
How am I supposed to close these?
Look at this.

260
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:47,031
I've had this guy before.
I've been to his house twice.

261
00:17:47,098 --> 00:17:50,829
L... I can't...
I can't close this stuff.

262
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:56,573
Shelly, how am I
supposed to...

263
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:59,303
They're going
to bounce me out of a job.

264
00:18:07,318 --> 00:18:10,913
Hello, Mr. Palermo?
I'm sorry.

265
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:14,356
Mr. Speice?
Mr. Robert Speice?

266
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:17,394
Yeah,
this is George Aaronow.

267
00:18:17,462 --> 00:18:20,556
I'm with Rio.
I spoke with your wife earlier.

268
00:18:20,631 --> 00:18:24,158
I'm the vice president of Rio Rancho
Properties in Furman, Arizona.

269
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:29,468
Yes. I'm calling from the airport,
and consulting my map,

270
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,770
I see that you and your wife
live near the airport.

271
00:18:31,843 --> 00:18:34,869
I have some rather...
rather unusual,

272
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:37,176
rather good information
on the property...

273
00:18:37,248 --> 00:18:41,651
Hello? Hello, this is
Sheldon Levene.

274
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:44,347
Please listen closely...
I only have a moment or so.

275
00:18:44,422 --> 00:18:48,017
I can speak only
to a Mrs. Nyborg.

276
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:52,051
Oh, this is Mrs. Nyborg.
Please listen closely, Mrs. Nyborg.

277
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,827
I'm calling from Consolidated
Properties of Arizona.

278
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,631
Our computer has chosen you
from all of the many thousands

279
00:18:59,704 --> 00:19:02,537
who write in requesting
information on our properties.

280
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:05,599
Now by federal law,
as you probably know,

281
00:19:05,676 --> 00:19:08,907
the prize must be awarded to you
even if you are not engaged

282
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,971
in our land
development plan.

283
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:14,678
The only stipulation, of course,
is that you and your husband

284
00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:17,915
must sign at the same time
for the receipt of your prize.

285
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:22,392
Now, I will be in the area
tonight, possibly tomorrow.

286
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,020
What do you think might be
a convenient time to meet

287
00:19:25,096 --> 00:19:27,223
with both you
and your husband?

288
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:29,926
Of course I'll hold.

289
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:45,743
- Bunch of fucking nonsense, huh?
- I can't close them.

290
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,341
- Nobody can close 'em.
- They're old.

291
00:19:47,418 --> 00:19:49,613
They're ancient...
a bunch of fucking nonsense.

292
00:19:49,687 --> 00:19:51,985
Get some jerk
to come in here...

293
00:19:52,056 --> 00:19:54,854
Sometimes I think,
"I wonder if I belong in this business."

294
00:19:54,926 --> 00:19:57,292
Send a guy out there...
no support, no confidence.

295
00:19:57,361 --> 00:20:00,023
Then I say,
"Nobody can close 'em."

296
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,623
- Then I look at Roma.
- Roma... fuck Roma.

297
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,759
Had a freak...
a little run of luck.

298
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,270
The leads are garbage.

299
00:20:07,338 --> 00:20:09,431
Then I say,
"Why give him the good leads?

300
00:20:09,507 --> 00:20:11,634
- He doesn't need 'em."
- You going out?

301
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:16,305
Yeah. I have to go out.
I can't make a sit.

302
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,282
- Have you tried?
- Yeah. Something's wrong with me.

303
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,319
What is it?
I can't push through.

304
00:20:22,386 --> 00:20:24,616
Get your coat on.
You're coming out with me.

305
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:26,782
- Something in me.
- Forget it.

306
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,918
- I try, I try.
- I said forget it, come on.

307
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:32,258
I can't close 'em.

308
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,528
Life.

309
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:39,832
I swear to God,
you work all your life...

310
00:20:39,904 --> 00:20:44,000
- Forget it, George.
- Roma, so on...

311
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:46,475
- so gifted.
- Gifted, my ass!

312
00:20:46,544 --> 00:20:50,105
- The guy gets a string of luck.
- No, no, no.

313
00:20:50,181 --> 00:20:51,876
The thing of it is,
money's tight.

314
00:20:51,949 --> 00:20:53,814
When times are tight,
it don't do no good

315
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:56,251
to throw around,
"Just go out and sell."

316
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,050
Threaten a man all you want,
you can't whip a dead horse.

317
00:20:59,123 --> 00:21:00,647
- Nope.
- All this garbage...

318
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:02,215
"Sell 10,000,
you win a Cadillac;

319
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:05,592
you lose, we're gonna fire
your ass"? It's medieval.

320
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,857
- Yes.
- It's wrong.

321
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:08,398
- Yes.
- Yes it is,

322
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:09,990
and you know
who's responsible?

323
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:12,035
- Who?
- You know who it is.

324
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:14,003
It's Mitch and Murray,
'cause it don't have to be this way.

325
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:16,097
- No.
- Look at Jerry Graff.

326
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,165
He's clean, he's doing
business for himself,

327
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:20,403
he's got that list...
with the nurses?

328
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:25,415
You see? That's thinking.
Why take a 10%% % sales commission?

329
00:21:25,483 --> 00:21:28,452
Why are we giving the rest away?
What are we giving 90%% % for?

330
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:31,147
For nothing.
For some jerk in the office,

331
00:21:31,222 --> 00:21:33,554
telling us, "Get out there and close,
go win a Cadillac."

332
00:21:33,624 --> 00:21:36,252
Graff goes out and buys.
He pays top dollar.

333
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:37,760
- You see?
- Yes.

334
00:21:37,828 --> 00:21:40,797
For the leads... that's thinking.
Now, he's got the leads,

335
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:45,063
he goes in business for himself.
That's what? That's thinking.

336
00:21:45,136 --> 00:21:47,070
Who... who's got
a steady job,

337
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:49,265
a regular job,
a couple of bucks nobody's touched?

338
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,830
Nurses.

339
00:21:50,908 --> 00:21:52,535
Graff goes and buys
a fucking list of nurses. One grand...

340
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,976
he paid two, I'll eat my hat.
4,000 or 5,000 nurses.

341
00:21:55,046 --> 00:21:57,446
- He's going wild.
- He is?

342
00:21:57,515 --> 00:22:00,746
- Yeah, he's doing very well.
- I heard they were running cold.

343
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:02,615
- The nurses?
- Yeah.

344
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:05,850
You hear a lot of things.
He's doing very well.

345
00:22:05,923 --> 00:22:07,788
- With River Oaks?
- River Oaks, Brook Farms.

346
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:10,554
All that shit. Somebody told me...
you know what he's clearing, himself?

347
00:22:10,628 --> 00:22:13,426
- 14, 15 grand a week.
- Himself?

348
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:16,830
That's what I'm saying.
Why? He's got the leads.

349
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:19,961
He's got the good leads.
What are we?

350
00:22:20,037 --> 00:22:21,800
We're sitting
in the shit here. Why?

351
00:22:21,872 --> 00:22:23,703
Because we got to go to them
to get them.

352
00:22:23,774 --> 00:22:26,675
90%% % of our sales we're paying
to the office for the leads.

353
00:22:26,744 --> 00:22:30,180
There's our leads, there's overhead,
phones, a lot of stuff.

354
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,216
What do you need?
A telephone?

355
00:22:32,283 --> 00:22:35,446
Some broad to say, "Good morning"?
Nothing. It's the leads.

356
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:37,817
The whole thing is the leads,
you understand me?

357
00:22:37,888 --> 00:22:40,686
You can't sell to a void...
you got to get a goddamn person.

358
00:22:40,758 --> 00:22:43,318
You get a lead, you get
a person... I'll go sell 'em.

359
00:22:43,394 --> 00:22:45,191
Otherwise, what do they want
from my life?

360
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,293
Hello, Danny?
Dan, it's Shel Levene.

361
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,393
Yeah, we spoke...
last May I called you.

362
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,667
I was in town from my estate
in Rio Rancho, and...

363
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,469
Arizona.

364
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,771
I wish we could have
gotten together at that time.

365
00:22:59,844 --> 00:23:03,644
Danny, that piece of property I had
for you has increased in value...

366
00:23:03,714 --> 00:23:08,913
Grace, Grace,
what was that figure? $76,000.

367
00:23:08,986 --> 00:23:11,454
Oh, Danny, I wish you could have
been in on it with me.

368
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:14,116
Look, I'm here overnight...
I have to go home tomorrow,

369
00:23:14,191 --> 00:23:18,059
and I thought, after the interest
you showed on the last trip, that...

370
00:23:18,129 --> 00:23:21,997
Hold it, Grace. Danny,
I know that you're serious,

371
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:25,160
and because of that, I am going
to shove my appointments around

372
00:23:25,236 --> 00:23:29,263
and make sure...
oh, gee, I wish that...

373
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:34,304
All right, Danny.
Yeah, all right.

374
00:23:44,955 --> 00:23:48,186
Going out tonight,
Shelly?

375
00:23:51,028 --> 00:23:53,997
What is this bullshit
with the sales promotion?

376
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:55,555
It isn't bullshit.
It's the way it is.

377
00:23:55,633 --> 00:23:57,726
You're going to fire
the bottom men on the list?

378
00:23:57,802 --> 00:24:00,202
That's the way it is
and I don't make the rules.

379
00:24:00,271 --> 00:24:03,604
- The rules come from downtown.
- I got a problem here, John.

380
00:24:03,674 --> 00:24:06,165
- I'm closing up the office.
- Come have a drink with me.

381
00:24:06,243 --> 00:24:09,508
- I've got to get home.
- Do me the courtesy... five minutes?

382
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,741
I am trying to get home
for two hours.

383
00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:14,808
I got to go home, grab one hour
with my kids, come back here,

384
00:24:14,885 --> 00:24:17,376
see if any of you closed
a contract, take the contract...

385
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:20,982
- How about one minute?
- What is it?

386
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:23,117
- I can't close these leads.
- Then move on.

387
00:24:23,194 --> 00:24:27,062
Don't jump! Don't jump out
of your manager bag a second.

388
00:24:27,131 --> 00:24:31,397
It's just two guys talking,
am I right? We're just talking.

389
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:34,063
You got the new leads.
If you would give me... just hold on.

390
00:24:34,138 --> 00:24:36,902
The Glengarry leads are to be
assigned only to closers.

391
00:24:36,974 --> 00:24:39,704
Hold on a second.
If you give me the good leads...

392
00:24:39,777 --> 00:24:41,404
You blew the last good one
I gave you.

393
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,140
No, no... hold on,
will you?

394
00:24:43,214 --> 00:24:45,808
I did not blow 'em.
One kicked out. One, I closed.

395
00:24:45,883 --> 00:24:47,783
- You didn't close it.
- Would you listen to me?

396
00:24:47,852 --> 00:24:51,652
I closed that cocksucker!
His ex! John, his ex!

397
00:24:51,722 --> 00:24:54,190
I didn't even know he was married.
The judge invalidated it.

398
00:24:54,258 --> 00:24:55,156
Shelly...

399
00:24:55,226 --> 00:24:57,786
What was that job, huh?
Bad luck. That's all it was.

400
00:24:57,862 --> 00:25:00,057
I pray you never find it...
it runs in streaks.

401
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:03,032
That's what it's doing,
that's all it does... streaks.

402
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,695
I pray that it misses you
and that's all I have to say.

403
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:09,763
Shit, I've got to eat.
Williamson...

404
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,970
look at the sheets.
Look at the sheets.

405
00:25:14,044 --> 00:25:17,741
1987, '88, '89...
six months in '89... who's on top?

406
00:25:17,815 --> 00:25:19,282
- Roma.
- Under him?

407
00:25:19,316 --> 00:25:22,114
- Moss.
- Oh, bullshit, John!

408
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:24,780
April to September it's me...
it's no fucking Moss.

409
00:25:24,855 --> 00:25:27,187
Due respect,
he's an order-taker.

410
00:25:27,258 --> 00:25:30,955
Talk... talks a good game,
but look on the board, it's me.

411
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:33,189
- Not lately it isn't.
- Not late...

412
00:25:33,964 --> 00:25:35,659
Well, lately...
kiss my ass "lately."

413
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:38,395
You call Murray and you call Mitch...
when we were on Peterson,

414
00:25:38,469 --> 00:25:41,131
who do you think bought the new car?
Call Mitch. The Seville?

415
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:44,299
He came in here...
"You bought that for me, fella."

416
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:48,277
And out of what? Hey, look at me!
Out of what? Nothing!

417
00:25:48,345 --> 00:25:50,575
Cold calling.
You want to talk about a sale?

418
00:25:50,648 --> 00:25:53,173
You are really
beginning to burn my ass, kid.

419
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:57,584
I can't get a lead, you...
it was skill, John.

420
00:25:57,655 --> 00:26:00,123
It could be working for you...
you want to throw it away.

421
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:02,386
- It isn't me.
- It's not you...

422
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,985
I wonder who it is.
Who the fuck am I talking to?

423
00:26:05,062 --> 00:26:08,828
- I need the leads to sell.
- After the contest. After the 30th.

424
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:11,129
Bullshit,
"After the contest."

425
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:13,898
If I'm not on that board by the 30th,
they're going to can my ass.

426
00:26:17,107 --> 00:26:20,702
I need those leads
and I need 'em now or I'm out.

427
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:31,618
You're going to miss me.
I swear to you, you will miss me.

428
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:33,452
Let me tell you
something, Shelly.

429
00:26:33,524 --> 00:26:36,550
I do what I'm hired to do...
you might do the same.

430
00:26:36,627 --> 00:26:38,492
- Jesus.
- Now wait a second!

431
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:44,032
I'm hired to watch the leads,
to marshal my sales force.

432
00:26:44,101 --> 00:26:46,228
I'm given a policy.
My job is to do that.

433
00:26:46,303 --> 00:26:48,362
Marshal your sales force?

434
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:51,101
Anybody falls below
a certain mark, I'm directed.

435
00:26:51,175 --> 00:26:53,143
I'm not permitted
to give them the premium leads.

436
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:57,169
How do they rise
above that mark? With dreck?

437
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:59,580
With this toilet paper
you're giving me?

438
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,242
You give me
one premium lead...

439
00:27:01,318 --> 00:27:03,013
Do you know what
the premium leads cost?

440
00:27:03,087 --> 00:27:05,351
Do I know what
the premium leads cost?

441
00:27:05,422 --> 00:27:06,855
Yeah,
I know what they cost.

442
00:27:06,924 --> 00:27:10,155
I generated the sufficient
dollar revenue to buy them.

443
00:27:10,227 --> 00:27:13,219
But I cannot sell shit!

444
00:27:13,297 --> 00:27:15,857
Jesus. And I've seen
these before, you know.

445
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:17,867
Christ, I saw these back...
Homestead...

446
00:27:17,935 --> 00:27:20,267
1985, we pitched
these cocksuckers Baywater.

447
00:27:20,337 --> 00:27:24,637
They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.
They're broke. They're deadbeats.

448
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:27,643
Just give me some leads that don't
come out of a phone book.

449
00:27:27,711 --> 00:27:30,407
You give me something hotter
than that and I can close it.

450
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:32,676
It's just a streak.
I'm gonna turn it around.

451
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:36,015
Hey, I need your help.

452
00:27:38,155 --> 00:27:40,988
I can't do it,
Shelly.

453
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,525
John...

454
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:51,261
I'll give you 10% .

455
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:53,895
- Of what?
- My end... what I close.

456
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:56,906
You give me the premium leads,
you're in for 10%% %, what I close.

457
00:27:56,974 --> 00:27:58,839
- And what if you don't close?
- I will.

458
00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:00,934
- What if you don't close?
- I will close.

459
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:03,104
What if you don't,
you understand?

460
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:06,081
Then I'm fucked. You think you're
the only guy with a family?

461
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,879
- You see what I'm saying?
- John...

462
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:10,216
I step out and you don't close,
then it's my job.

463
00:28:10,287 --> 00:28:12,255
- Then I'm fucked.
- I will close!

464
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:15,053
Now, 10%% % John...
I can get hot, you know that.

465
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:17,685
- Not lately you can't.
- That's defeatist... fuck it!

466
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:20,696
Go with me. Get on my side
and let's do something.

467
00:28:20,764 --> 00:28:23,426
You want to run this office?
You heard what the man said...

468
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,934
"Attack."
Let's do something.

469
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:30,406
- Huh?
- 20% .

470
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:34,437
- All right.
- And 50 bucks a lead.

471
00:28:34,511 --> 00:28:36,502
- No?
- Oh!

472
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:45,150
Oh, shit.

473
00:28:58,602 --> 00:29:02,902
Listen...
I got to talk to you.

474
00:29:02,973 --> 00:29:07,842
Permit me to do this a second.
I'm older than you.

475
00:29:07,911 --> 00:29:11,244
A man acquires a reputation
on the street.

476
00:29:11,315 --> 00:29:14,045
What he does when he's up,
what he does at other times...

477
00:29:14,118 --> 00:29:17,315
I said, "10," you said, "No."
You said, "20," I said, "Fine."

478
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:20,789
Now you want to throw
this 50-buck thing in.

479
00:29:20,858 --> 00:29:25,727
John, a good deal... has got to be
one where both parties...

480
00:29:25,796 --> 00:29:29,027
Okay, okay, okay, fine...
20%% %, 50 bucks a lead. It's done.

481
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:30,999
Let's go out.
We make some money.

482
00:29:31,068 --> 00:29:33,696
I got bills to pay.
I want two sits tonight

483
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:36,433
and I want the good leads...
the Glengarry leads... two.

484
00:29:36,507 --> 00:29:38,702
Two, John, because
I am going to close 'em both.

485
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:41,574
It's a long road
with no turning, pally.

486
00:29:41,645 --> 00:29:44,512
Huh? Okay.
Now, let's go.

487
00:29:44,581 --> 00:29:47,175
I've got to go back
to the office to get 'em.

488
00:29:47,251 --> 00:29:51,153
Go on, let's go.
This is what I was saying, John.

489
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:53,917
All you need, a little boost,
you turn a streak around.

490
00:29:53,991 --> 00:29:57,017
Am I right? Good, huh?
Huh, good?

491
00:29:57,094 --> 00:29:59,528
What?

492
00:29:59,596 --> 00:30:02,360
- What?
- Two leads, 100 bucks.

493
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,526
- Now?
- Now, yes. When?

494
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:06,865
- Shit, John.
- I wish I could.

495
00:30:06,937 --> 00:30:09,633
You fucking asshole.

496
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:12,972
I don't have it...
I don't...

497
00:30:13,043 --> 00:30:15,375
I'll bring it in the office
in the morning.

498
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,846
- I'll be coming with the sales.
- Nope.

499
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,980
I can't fucking
believe this.

500
00:30:23,053 --> 00:30:26,386
All right, here's...

501
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,288
20... 30, and...

502
00:30:28,358 --> 00:30:31,919
Jesus, here's the 30.
I'll bring the rest in tomorrow.

503
00:30:31,995 --> 00:30:34,190
We got to do this, huh, pal?
For Christ's sake!

504
00:30:34,264 --> 00:30:36,095
No.

505
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:42,101
- My daughter...
- I can't do it, Shelly.

506
00:30:42,172 --> 00:30:45,232
I got to tell you something.
It wasn't so long ago,

507
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:49,211
I'd pick up the phone
and call Murray... I got your job.

508
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,680
"Murray, the kid is burning my ass."
"Shelly, he's gone."

509
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:57,551
You are gone before
I'm back from lunch.

510
00:30:57,621 --> 00:30:59,350
Bought him a trip
to Bermuda once.

511
00:30:59,423 --> 00:31:01,254
- I've got to go.
- All right, hey.

512
00:31:01,325 --> 00:31:05,853
Give me... I'll take two more
of the old leads.

513
00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:08,523
- I gave you two today.
- One is a bust-out, John!

514
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:10,590
- The other ain't home!
- Shelly...

515
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:11,793
I promise you,
I've been on the phone... I know.

516
00:31:11,835 --> 00:31:13,530
No more leads today...
two per day. You've got yours.

517
00:31:13,604 --> 00:31:15,629
All right.

518
00:31:15,706 --> 00:31:18,106
- All right?
- Sure.

519
00:31:23,313 --> 00:31:27,807
We will do that...
other thing.

520
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,683
I guess I left
my wallet in my room.

521
00:31:38,829 --> 00:31:41,855
Deadbeats.
Deadbeats, all of 'em.

522
00:31:41,932 --> 00:31:45,629
My mistake.
I shouldn't have took the leads.

523
00:31:45,702 --> 00:31:48,000
- You had to.
- Yeah? Why?

524
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:50,301
- To get on the...
- To get on the board, yeah.

525
00:31:50,374 --> 00:31:52,467
How am I gonna get on the board
trying to sell a doctor?

526
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,306
Two regular,
two chocolate donuts.

527
00:31:54,378 --> 00:31:57,438
Give me the same thing to go.
And don't try and sell an Indian.

528
00:31:57,514 --> 00:31:59,209
I will never try to sell
an Indian.

529
00:31:59,283 --> 00:32:01,547
These names come up...
you ever get 'em..."Patel"?

530
00:32:01,618 --> 00:32:04,587
- You ever get 'em?
- I think I had one once.

531
00:32:04,655 --> 00:32:06,953
You had one,
you'd know it..."Patel."

532
00:32:07,024 --> 00:32:08,685
They keep coming up.
I don't know.

533
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:11,091
They like to talk to salesmen.
They're lonely.

534
00:32:11,161 --> 00:32:13,891
They like to feel superior...
never bought a fucking thing.

535
00:32:13,964 --> 00:32:16,558
I don't know.
Come down the line...

536
00:32:16,633 --> 00:32:21,093
doctors, lawyers, Indians...
times are tight. It's tight.

537
00:32:21,171 --> 00:32:25,665
Pressure's just too great.
Man can't work all of 'em.

538
00:32:25,742 --> 00:32:29,473
You go in the door... I got to close
this fucker or I don't eat lunch,

539
00:32:29,546 --> 00:32:33,277
or I don't win a Cadillac.
We work too hard, George.

540
00:32:35,485 --> 00:32:40,752
Remember when we were... when we
were selling Glen Ross Farms?

541
00:32:40,824 --> 00:32:43,088
Didn't we sell
a bunch of that?

542
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,321
- They came in...
- They fucked it up.

543
00:32:45,395 --> 00:32:47,386
- They did.
- They killed the goose. And now...

544
00:32:47,464 --> 00:32:49,762
- We're stuck with this...
- Stuck with this fucking shit.

545
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:51,460
- This shit.
- It's too...

546
00:32:51,535 --> 00:32:53,799
- It is.
- You get a bad month...

547
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:57,307
they put you on this board.
Some contest board.

548
00:32:57,374 --> 00:32:59,842
- It's not right.
- It's not right to the customers.

549
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,208
I know, it's... hey. What did I learn
as a kid on Western?

550
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:08,283
Don't sell a guy one car.
Sell him five cars over 15 years.

551
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,081
- That's right.
- You're goddamn right, it's right.

552
00:33:10,153 --> 00:33:13,122
Guys come in..."Oh, the blah,
blah, blah. I know what I'll do.

553
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,590
I'll go out and rob everybody
blind and go to Argentina

554
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:17,524
'cause nobody ever
thought of this before."

555
00:33:17,594 --> 00:33:20,461
So they kill the goose
and the man's worked all his life...

556
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,430
- That's right.
- He's got to cower in his boots...

557
00:33:22,466 --> 00:33:23,592
Boots, yes...

558
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:27,000
For some fucking "Sell 10,000,
win the steak knives."

559
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,970
- What do you do?
- What can you do?

560
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,439
What can you do
if you don't have the leads?

561
00:33:31,508 --> 00:33:34,238
If you do not
have the goddamn leads!

562
00:33:34,444 --> 00:33:37,345
Mr. Spannel?
Sheldon Levene.

563
00:33:37,414 --> 00:33:39,439
I was speaking
to your wife earlier?

564
00:33:39,516 --> 00:33:41,381
Come in.

565
00:33:42,686 --> 00:33:44,847
- "Cats and dogs," huh?
- Yeah.

566
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:47,550
Oh, "cats and dogs."

567
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,658
Oh, I see you're
interested in fishing.

568
00:33:52,729 --> 00:33:55,425
- Yeah.
- I've fished myself... many years.

569
00:33:55,499 --> 00:33:58,332
Muskee, Wisconsin.
Ooh, a beauty.

570
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:03,071
- Where's the missus?
- Out at the PTA.

571
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,005
- Ahh.
- What was this in reference...?

572
00:34:05,075 --> 00:34:07,134
I spoke to your wife
earlier on the phone.

573
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,110
I called, I'm in town
with Rio Rancho.

574
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:12,376
Yes, I'm sorry. She said you had
some sort of award?

575
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:15,714
Yes, I was speaking to the people
in my sales organization...

576
00:34:15,786 --> 00:34:19,552
my representatives in this area...
and Mr. Spannel...

577
00:34:19,623 --> 00:34:22,456
your name is Larry.
Mind if I call you Larry?

578
00:34:22,526 --> 00:34:26,223
All right, Larry.
We had a consultant,

579
00:34:26,296 --> 00:34:29,424
and he made me...
he made me an offer.

580
00:34:29,499 --> 00:34:33,060
He offered me $230,000
to promote a sales plan...

581
00:34:33,136 --> 00:34:37,664
to present investment opportunities
in Rio Rancho to the public.

582
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:41,006
Well, I said, "Hell,
let me save you the 230,

583
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:44,172
and pass the savings
along to the investor."

584
00:34:44,247 --> 00:34:47,410
My people immediately said,
"Whoa, how do you do that?

585
00:34:47,484 --> 00:34:50,453
How can you present
investment opportunities

586
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,715
without television,
without magazine ads?"

587
00:34:52,789 --> 00:34:54,689
I said, "You take
something this good,

588
00:34:54,758 --> 00:34:56,988
you go to a man...
has invested in the past...

589
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:00,928
you go to him direct and offer
the money to him... rebate.

590
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:04,126
And don't give it
to this expert."

591
00:35:05,569 --> 00:35:07,594
So you're here
to sell me some land?

592
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:09,866
No, I wouldn't try
to sell you...

593
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,273
I leave that to the salesmen
and people who want to own land.

594
00:35:13,343 --> 00:35:16,107
I think something
has to be fed,

595
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:19,114
watered and painted,
but don't invest in it.

596
00:35:19,182 --> 00:35:21,707
That motto has stood me
in good stead.

597
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:23,980
- Mister...
- Just call me Shelly.

598
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:26,284
I have never
been afraid of familiarity.

599
00:35:26,356 --> 00:35:28,381
I'm walking out the door.
I've got to pick up my wife at the...

600
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:30,858
Let's take my car.
We'll pick her up together.

601
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:33,157
Spoke to the little woman
on the phone... can't wait to meet her.

602
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,027
No, we're going
over to our relatives'.

603
00:35:35,098 --> 00:35:37,760
- She didn't say anything about that.
- I'm sure she forgot.

604
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:40,462
- I'm on a plane to Florida...
- I'm sorry if we put you out.

605
00:35:40,537 --> 00:35:43,062
You didn't put me out.
I'm just trying to think, Larry.

606
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,700
You know, that's the only parcel
that I've got.

607
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:48,506
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go back to the computer,

608
00:35:48,578 --> 00:35:51,741
I'm gonna pull another one, and we're
gonna speak to your relatives, too.

609
00:35:51,815 --> 00:35:54,181
- No, no, no.
- C'mon, you're a busy man, so am I.

610
00:35:54,251 --> 00:35:57,118
My God, I'm in the act
of giving a gift away.

611
00:35:57,187 --> 00:36:00,122
Look, I don't want to buy land.
I don't want to invest in land.

612
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:04,752
I have nothing. She took the call
without my knowledge.

613
00:36:04,828 --> 00:36:07,092
I have no business
that I wish to transact.

614
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:08,995
I don't want to tell you
how to handle your wife.

615
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:12,900
My wife filled in a form, and we
have been plagued for the last year...

616
00:36:12,969 --> 00:36:15,938
That's the situation
I'm trying to alleviate, Larry.

617
00:36:16,006 --> 00:36:17,803
No, no.
Do you understand?

618
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:20,874
Thank you. No.

619
00:36:36,626 --> 00:36:38,856
- Roma, man... he don't care.
- He don't care.

620
00:36:38,929 --> 00:36:42,365
He's sitting on top of the world.
He's got good leads, good prospects.

621
00:36:42,432 --> 00:36:44,832
- Sales, sales.
- Sales contests.

622
00:36:44,901 --> 00:36:47,699
- That's what I'm saying.
- Times turn hard, they bounce you out.

623
00:36:47,771 --> 00:36:49,796
If they bounce you with no
confidence...

624
00:36:49,873 --> 00:36:52,467
That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying to you.

625
00:36:57,814 --> 00:37:00,305
If they get you
on a bad beat...

626
00:37:00,383 --> 00:37:02,851
and you got to go out there,
get a new job...

627
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:04,682
- With no...
- With no confidence...

628
00:37:04,721 --> 00:37:06,279
Yes.

629
00:37:06,356 --> 00:37:10,588
I'll tell you what the hard part is...
to stop thinking like a goddamn slave.

630
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:14,152
You say the Nazis
in Europe...
"If they came in my door"...

631
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:16,597
bullshit, the time is now.
What do you do now?

632
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:18,998
Some guy pissing in your face.
Cocksucker...

633
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:21,503
wants to break your rice bowl.

634
00:37:21,571 --> 00:37:25,166
Mitch and Murray, fuck you.
What I say... fuck you!

635
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:28,040
Sitting on the good leads.

636
00:37:28,111 --> 00:37:30,944
George, we're men here.

637
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:33,543
Yes.

638
00:37:33,617 --> 00:37:37,553
And I'll tell you...
I'll tell you what the hard part is.

639
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:40,215
- What?
- Starting up.

640
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:43,020
Standing up.
Breaking free of this bullshit,

641
00:37:43,093 --> 00:37:46,790
this enslavement to some guy,
'cause he's got the upper hand.

642
00:37:49,566 --> 00:37:52,501
This is the difference...
listen to me, George.

643
00:37:52,569 --> 00:37:54,730
Now Jerry Graff went
into business for himself.

644
00:37:54,804 --> 00:38:00,401
He said, "I'm going on my own."
And he was free, you understand me?

645
00:38:01,611 --> 00:38:04,603
I'll tell you... I'll tell you
what somebody should do.

646
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:08,640
What?

647
00:38:08,718 --> 00:38:11,346
Somebody should stand up
and strike back.

648
00:38:11,421 --> 00:38:13,753
Somebody should do something
to them.

649
00:38:13,823 --> 00:38:16,053
- What?
- Something to pay them back.

650
00:38:16,126 --> 00:38:17,957
Someone should hurt them,
Mitch and Murray.

651
00:38:18,028 --> 00:38:19,723
- Somebody should hurt them?
- Yeah.

652
00:38:19,796 --> 00:38:21,661
- How?
- Someone should do something

653
00:38:21,731 --> 00:38:23,460
- to hurt them where they live.
- What?

654
00:38:23,533 --> 00:38:26,730
Someone should rob the office.
That's what I'm saying.

655
00:38:26,803 --> 00:38:30,239
If we were that kind of guy
to hold up the joint and trash it,

656
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:33,367
it looks like robbery,
we take the leads out of the files

657
00:38:33,443 --> 00:38:35,377
and we go to Jerry Graff.

658
00:38:35,445 --> 00:38:39,313
And we take the fucking
Glengarry leads! Huh?

659
00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:45,417
Yeah, Mr. Nyborg? Ah, Mr. Nyborg,
Sheldon Levene.

660
00:38:45,488 --> 00:38:48,082
I was speaking to your wife earlier.
That's right.

661
00:38:48,158 --> 00:38:51,787
I'd like to speak to you
about awarding you your prize.

662
00:38:51,861 --> 00:38:53,852
We're coming to the end
of our fiscal year,

663
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:56,626
I'd really like to get it
off the books before...

664
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,692
yes, the prize
for Consolidated Properties.

665
00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:02,294
The information you requested
on Rio Rancho.

666
00:39:02,372 --> 00:39:05,569
Now, I'm in town only for...
well, let me see.

667
00:39:05,642 --> 00:39:08,611
I suppose I could
swing by tonight. Yes. Uh-huh.

668
00:39:08,678 --> 00:39:11,272
When do you think
it might be more convenient?

669
00:39:11,314 --> 00:39:13,908
As I said,
I could swing by tonight...

670
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:16,475
well, of course,
you speak to your wife.

671
00:39:16,553 --> 00:39:18,487
Grace, I'm gonna need

672
00:39:18,555 --> 00:39:21,115
a first-class seat,
passport, 10,000 in cash,

673
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:23,455
put that with the negotiable
papers, if you would.

674
00:39:23,526 --> 00:39:27,724
And put me
on the telex hookup... yes?

675
00:39:27,797 --> 00:39:31,289
Well, when do you think
Mrs. Nyborg might be back?

676
00:39:31,801 --> 00:39:34,793
All train compartments
smell vaguely of shit.

677
00:39:34,871 --> 00:39:38,068
It gets so you don't
mind it.

678
00:39:38,141 --> 00:39:41,304
That's the worst thing
that I can confess.

679
00:39:41,378 --> 00:39:43,972
You know how long it took me
to get there? A long time.

680
00:39:45,715 --> 00:39:50,152
When you die you're gonna regret
the things you don't do.

681
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,314
You think you're queer?
I'm gonna tell you something.

682
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:56,826
We're all queer.
You think you're a thief? So what?

683
00:39:56,893 --> 00:39:59,487
You get befuddled
by a middle-class morality?

684
00:39:59,562 --> 00:40:01,496
Get shut of it.
Shut it out.

685
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:05,660
You cheat on your wife,
you did it. Live with it.

686
00:40:05,735 --> 00:40:09,000
You fuck little girls,
so be it.

687
00:40:09,072 --> 00:40:12,838
There's an absolute morality?
Maybe.

688
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:15,537
And then what?

689
00:40:15,612 --> 00:40:19,139
If you think there is,
go ahead, be that thing.

690
00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:22,182
Bad people go to hell?
I don't think so.

691
00:40:22,252 --> 00:40:24,186
You think that,
act that way.

692
00:40:24,254 --> 00:40:30,659
A hell exists on earth?
Yes. I won't live in it.

693
00:40:30,727 --> 00:40:32,718
That's me.

694
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:41,302
Did you ever take a dump, made you
feel like you slept for 12 hours?

695
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:44,033
- Did I...?
- Yes.

696
00:40:44,107 --> 00:40:47,599
- I don't know.
- Or a piss?

697
00:40:51,981 --> 00:40:54,950
Great meals fade
in reflection.

698
00:40:55,018 --> 00:40:57,714
Everything else gains.
Do you know why?

699
00:40:57,787 --> 00:41:01,154
'Cause it's only food.
This shit we put in us,

700
00:41:01,224 --> 00:41:03,658
keeps us going...
it's only food.

701
00:41:04,894 --> 00:41:07,226
The great fucks
you may have had,

702
00:41:07,297 --> 00:41:09,231
what do you remember
about them?

703
00:41:09,299 --> 00:41:13,360
- What do I remember?
- Yeah.

704
00:41:15,171 --> 00:41:16,900
I don't know.
For me,

705
00:41:16,973 --> 00:41:20,431
I'm saying what it is,
it's probably not the orgasm.

706
00:41:22,145 --> 00:41:25,911
Some broad's forearm
on your neck,

707
00:41:25,982 --> 00:41:30,419
something her eyes did.
There was this sound she made.

708
00:41:31,621 --> 00:41:34,419
Or it's me in the...
I'm telling you...

709
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:38,427
I'm in bed the next day,
she brought me cafe au lait,

710
00:41:38,495 --> 00:41:41,931
gives me a cigarette,
my balls feel like concrete.

711
00:41:41,998 --> 00:41:43,522
Eh?

712
00:41:45,635 --> 00:41:47,967
What I'm saying,
what is our life?

713
00:41:49,672 --> 00:41:53,369
Our life is looking forward
or it's looking back.

714
00:41:53,443 --> 00:41:57,277
That's it.
That's our life.

715
00:41:57,347 --> 00:41:59,941
Where's the moment?

716
00:42:04,454 --> 00:42:07,423
And what is it
we're so afraid of?

717
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:09,390
Loss. What else?

718
00:42:09,459 --> 00:42:14,590
The bank closes, we get sick,
my wife died on a plane?

719
00:42:16,065 --> 00:42:19,262
The stock market collapsed?
What of these things happen?

720
00:42:19,335 --> 00:42:22,429
None of them.
We worry anyway. Why?

721
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:25,797
What could we get
for them?

722
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:28,605
- For them?
- For the leads.

723
00:42:28,678 --> 00:42:30,703
What could we get
for the leads?

724
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:35,149
I don't know. 10 bucks a throw.
15 maybe. I don't know.

725
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:39,381
For the leads, you're saying?
Say somebody took them,

726
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:42,584
- went to Jerry Graff?
- Yeah. How many leads do we have?

727
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:43,990
The Glengarry?
The premium leads?

728
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,257
I've got to think they've got 500.
Say 500 leads.

729
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:50,595
You're saying a fella could take
those leads and sell them to Graff?

730
00:42:50,667 --> 00:42:52,931
The leads to Graff.
Yes. I was saying... yeah.

731
00:42:53,002 --> 00:42:55,596
A guy could take...
like anything else, it seems to me,

732
00:42:55,672 --> 00:42:58,197
that is negotiable,
a guy could sell them.

733
00:42:58,274 --> 00:43:01,675
- How do you know he'd buy them?
- Because I worked for him.

734
00:43:01,744 --> 00:43:05,441
- You didn't talk to him?
- No. What do you mean?

735
00:43:05,515 --> 00:43:07,608
- Did I talk to him about this?
- Yeah.

736
00:43:07,684 --> 00:43:09,982
Are you just talking about this,
or are we just talking about it?

737
00:43:10,053 --> 00:43:12,487
- Just speaking about it.
- Speaking about it as an idea?

738
00:43:12,555 --> 00:43:14,648
- Yes.
- We're not actually talking about it.

739
00:43:14,724 --> 00:43:17,488
- No.
- Talking about it as a robbery.

740
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,324
As a robbery? No.

741
00:43:22,765 --> 00:43:24,995
- Well...
- Hey.

742
00:43:25,068 --> 00:43:27,866
So all this...
you didn't actually call Graff?

743
00:43:27,937 --> 00:43:30,371
- You didn't talk to him?
- Not actually, no.

744
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,704
- You didn't?
- No, not actually.

745
00:43:32,775 --> 00:43:34,367
- Did you?
- What did I say?

746
00:43:34,444 --> 00:43:36,241
- What did you say?
- I said, "Not actually."

747
00:43:36,312 --> 00:43:38,473
Fuck you care, George?
We're just talking.

748
00:43:38,548 --> 00:43:39,879
- We are?
- Yes.

749
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:43,317
- Because it's a crime.
- Robbery. That's right.

750
00:43:45,154 --> 00:43:47,019
It is a crime.

751
00:43:49,626 --> 00:43:52,527
- It's also very safe.
- You're actually talking about this.

752
00:43:52,595 --> 00:43:55,359
- That's right.
- You're going to steal the leads.

753
00:43:55,431 --> 00:43:56,864
- Have I said that?
- Are you?

754
00:43:56,933 --> 00:43:58,730
- Did I say that?
- Did you talk to Graff?

755
00:43:58,801 --> 00:44:00,393
- What did I say?
- What did he say?

756
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:02,267
What did he say?

757
00:44:05,475 --> 00:44:07,568
He'd buy them.

758
00:44:16,452 --> 00:44:18,579
You're gonna steal...

759
00:44:18,655 --> 00:44:21,818
you're gonna steal the Glengarry
leads and sell them to Graff?

760
00:44:21,891 --> 00:44:24,917
- Yes.
- What's he gonna pay?

761
00:44:24,994 --> 00:44:28,259
He figures there's 500 leads,
let's say 10 bucks apiece,

762
00:44:28,331 --> 00:44:31,926
- that's $2,500 each.
- Each?

763
00:44:32,001 --> 00:44:33,935
- "Each"?
- That's right, George.

764
00:44:34,003 --> 00:44:36,437
- You're saying me?
- No, you and me.

765
00:44:36,506 --> 00:44:40,772
Yeah. That's exactly
what I'm saying. $2,500 apiece.

766
00:44:40,843 --> 00:44:43,141
You and me for one night's work,
and a job with Graff

767
00:44:43,212 --> 00:44:45,976
- working the premium leads.
- A job with Graff?

768
00:44:46,049 --> 00:44:48,449
- Is that what I said?
- He'd give me a job?

769
00:44:48,518 --> 00:44:50,577
He could take you on.
Yes.

770
00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:14,799
Hello?

771
00:45:14,877 --> 00:45:17,277
I was dialing the direct line
to my daughter's room.

772
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:20,077
Sheldon Levene.
She's in...

773
00:45:20,149 --> 00:45:24,711
well, yeah, I'm sure she's asleep.
But... where's the duty nurse?

774
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:29,322
They canceled her...
well, let me talk...

775
00:45:29,392 --> 00:45:31,383
who am I speaking to?

776
00:45:34,163 --> 00:45:37,428
I'll have the money there
tomorrow.

777
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:39,992
It's a big decision,
George.

778
00:45:40,069 --> 00:45:43,436
At times a guy
has got to make one.

779
00:45:43,506 --> 00:45:45,599
It's a big decision
and it's a big reward.

780
00:45:45,675 --> 00:45:49,008
$2,500 and a job, it's a big reward
for one night's work.

781
00:45:49,078 --> 00:45:51,171
Yes.

782
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:53,715
Sometimes a guy...

783
00:45:53,783 --> 00:45:56,149
sometimes, a man
if he wants a reward...

784
00:45:56,219 --> 00:45:58,779
That's absolutely right.

785
00:45:58,855 --> 00:46:00,846
He'll do one thing,
one thing on one night.

786
00:46:00,923 --> 00:46:05,485
That's absolutely right.
The thing is, it's got to be tonight.

787
00:46:05,561 --> 00:46:06,619
What?

788
00:46:06,696 --> 00:46:08,687
What, what?
The leads ain't going to leave?

789
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,960
They bring those leads up,
wave them under your nose,

790
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:13,195
tomorrow they take them downtown,
parcel them out.

791
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:16,033
A guy wants those leads,
he's gonna have to get them tonight.

792
00:46:16,105 --> 00:46:19,040
Tonight is the thing.
Talk about a chance.

793
00:46:19,108 --> 00:46:20,837
It's when a chance
presents itself.

794
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:22,537
You got to go
in there tonight.

795
00:46:22,612 --> 00:46:23,977
- You.
- I'm sorry?

796
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:25,742
- You.
- Me?

797
00:46:25,815 --> 00:46:27,874
You have to go in.
You have to get the leads.

798
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:30,384
- I do?
- It's not something for nothing.

799
00:46:30,453 --> 00:46:34,219
I took you in on this.
You have to go. It's your thing.

800
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:36,451
I've made a deal with Graff.
I can't go in.

801
00:46:36,526 --> 00:46:39,791
I've spoken out on this too much.
I've got a big mouth.

802
00:46:39,862 --> 00:46:42,888
"The fucking leads," et cetera,
"the tight-ass company," blah, blah.

803
00:46:42,965 --> 00:46:45,900
- They'll know when you go to Graff.
- What will they know?

804
00:46:45,968 --> 00:46:48,232
That I stole the leads?
I didn't steal the leads.

805
00:46:48,304 --> 00:46:51,068
I'm gonna go to the movies.
Then I'm gonna have a late drink

806
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,301
- at the Como Inn with a friend.
- Dave.

807
00:46:53,376 --> 00:46:54,673
Yes?

808
00:46:54,744 --> 00:46:56,837
You want me to break into the office
tonight and steal the leads?

809
00:46:56,913 --> 00:46:58,175
- Yes.
- No.

810
00:46:58,247 --> 00:46:59,839
- Oh, yes, George.
- What does that mean?

811
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:04,376
Listen to this. I have an alibi.
I'm going to the Como Inn.

812
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:07,184
Why? Why?
The place gets robbed,

813
00:47:07,256 --> 00:47:09,724
they're going to come looking for me.
Why? Because I probably did it.

814
00:47:09,792 --> 00:47:12,226
Let me ask you this...
are you going to turn me in?

815
00:47:12,295 --> 00:47:14,126
What if you don't get caught?

816
00:47:14,197 --> 00:47:15,687
They come to you,
are you going to turn me in?

817
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:17,791
- Why would they come to me?
- They're going to come to everybody.

818
00:47:17,867 --> 00:47:19,630
- Why would I do it?
- You wouldn't, George.

819
00:47:19,702 --> 00:47:21,693
That's why I'm talking to you now.
They come to you,

820
00:47:21,771 --> 00:47:23,568
- are you going to turn me in?
- No.

821
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:25,300
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

822
00:47:25,341 --> 00:47:30,369
Uh-huh. George...
when they come to me,

823
00:47:30,446 --> 00:47:33,108
if I have to go in there,
and if I get caught...

824
00:47:33,182 --> 00:47:36,015
- they come to me...
- You don't have to go in.

825
00:47:36,085 --> 00:47:37,950
I have to go in, see?
That's something I have to do.

826
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,079
- Why?
- Why?

827
00:47:40,156 --> 00:47:41,748
Are you going to give me $7,500?

828
00:47:41,824 --> 00:47:44,054
75? I thought we were
splitting five grand.

829
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:47,119
I lied, all right? Your end is 25,
my end is my own concern.

830
00:47:47,196 --> 00:47:50,165
Now, stick with me here.
If they come to me,

831
00:47:50,233 --> 00:47:52,895
I'm caught, they're going to ask me
who were accomplices.

832
00:47:52,969 --> 00:47:54,630
- Me.
- Absolutely.

833
00:47:54,704 --> 00:47:56,001
That's ridiculous.

834
00:47:56,038 --> 00:47:57,903
To the law, you're
an accessory before the fact.

835
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,875
- I didn't ask to be.
- Tough luck, because you are.

836
00:48:00,943 --> 00:48:03,571
- Because you told me about it?
- That's right.

837
00:48:03,646 --> 00:48:06,171
Why are you doing this
to me, Dave?

838
00:48:06,249 --> 00:48:08,877
Why are you talking this way to me?
I don't understand.

839
00:48:08,951 --> 00:48:12,182
- Why are you doing this at all?
- None of your fucking business.

840
00:48:12,255 --> 00:48:14,155
Just in or out?
You tell me.

841
00:48:14,223 --> 00:48:15,747
You're out,
you take the consequences.

842
00:48:15,825 --> 00:48:17,759
- I do?
- That's right.

843
00:48:17,827 --> 00:48:19,795
- And why is that?
- Because you listened.

844
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:21,653
Well, when will
Mrs. Nyborg be back?

845
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:24,325
You know, I hate to keep
calling you this late, Bruce,

846
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,530
but I feel a responsibility,
I must say. When you have...

847
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:33,665
You know, they say,
"You don't buy it, you rent it."

848
00:48:33,743 --> 00:48:36,041
- Huh?
- The thing.

849
00:48:36,112 --> 00:48:41,015
You really...
what do you keep?

850
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:43,881
I mean, you don't keep
anything, really.

851
00:48:43,953 --> 00:48:46,717
- No.
- Security.

852
00:48:46,789 --> 00:48:49,383
Things. Things.

853
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:51,858
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.

854
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:56,524
It's just... you try
to stave off insecurity.

855
00:48:56,599 --> 00:48:57,998
You can't do it.

856
00:48:58,434 --> 00:49:00,527
- No.
- No. That's what I'm telling you.

857
00:49:00,603 --> 00:49:05,870
Stocks, bonds, objects of art,
real estate, what are they?

858
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:09,378
An opportunity.
To what? To make money?

859
00:49:09,445 --> 00:49:13,381
Perhaps. To lose money?
Perhaps.

860
00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:16,941
To indulge and to learn
about ourselves? Perhaps.

861
00:49:17,019 --> 00:49:20,113
So fucking what?
What is it? They're an opportunity.

862
00:49:20,189 --> 00:49:23,124
That's all they are.
They're an event.

863
00:49:23,192 --> 00:49:26,855
A guy comes to you,
you make a call. You send in a card,

864
00:49:26,929 --> 00:49:29,693
I have these properties
I would like for you to see.

865
00:49:29,765 --> 00:49:32,791
What does this mean?
What do you want it to mean?

866
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:34,996
You see what I'm saying?

867
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,040
Things happen to you.

868
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:43,938
Glad I met you.

869
00:49:44,013 --> 00:49:45,708
I'm glad I met you,
James.

870
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:50,478
I want to show you
something.

871
00:49:50,553 --> 00:49:53,078
It may mean something to you,
it may not.

872
00:49:53,155 --> 00:49:55,988
I don't know.
I don't know anymore.

873
00:49:58,761 --> 00:50:01,821
What is that?
Florida.

874
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:04,731
Glengarry Highlands.
Florida.

875
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,792
Bullshit.
And maybe that's true.

876
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:10,998
And that's what I said.

877
00:50:11,073 --> 00:50:13,598
But look at this.

878
00:50:13,676 --> 00:50:18,113
What is this?
This is a piece of land.

879
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,648
Listen to what I'm going
to tell you now.

880
00:50:48,711 --> 00:50:50,804
- What happened?
- Where do you work?

881
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,474
I work, yes.
I work here.

882
00:50:53,549 --> 00:50:55,983
- What is it? What happened?
- Robbery.

883
00:51:02,391 --> 00:51:06,487
Williamson. Williamson,
did they get the contracts?

884
00:51:09,165 --> 00:51:11,565
All right, tell me.
Now. Tell me.

885
00:51:11,634 --> 00:51:13,465
- They stole the contracts?
- Excuse me, sir.

886
00:51:13,536 --> 00:51:14,935
- Did they get my contract?
- Excuse me, fella.

887
00:51:15,004 --> 00:51:16,232
- Did they?
- Would you excuse us?

888
00:51:16,305 --> 00:51:18,432
Don't fuck with me, fella.
I'm talking about a Cadillac car

889
00:51:18,507 --> 00:51:21,135
- that you owe me.
- They didn't get your contract.

890
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:23,576
- I filed it before I left.
- They didn't get my contracts?

891
00:51:23,646 --> 00:51:25,580
They got... excuse me.

892
00:51:25,648 --> 00:51:27,673
Fuck.

893
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:30,514
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Williamson!

894
00:51:30,586 --> 00:51:33,487
- Williamson, open the fucking door.
- Who are you?

895
00:51:33,556 --> 00:51:35,683
- They didn't get the contracts.
- Did they?

896
00:51:35,758 --> 00:51:38,283
They got... listen to me.
They got some of them.

897
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:41,023
- Some of them?
- Who told you?

898
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:44,430
Who told me?
Who told me we had a robbery?

899
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,161
We got a fucking board
up on the window.

900
00:51:46,235 --> 00:51:50,695
Who is this? Yes.
Yes, I confess. I did it.

901
00:51:50,773 --> 00:51:53,071
Now, leave me
a second here, please.

902
00:51:53,142 --> 00:51:55,804
- Okay, now, talk to me.
- I'm still trying to sort it out.

903
00:51:55,878 --> 00:51:58,039
- So far...
- Talk to me. Talk to me.

904
00:51:58,114 --> 00:52:01,379
They got some
of the contracts?

905
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:04,647
Lingk. James Lingk,
which I closed last night.

906
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,381
- You closed it last night?
- Yes.

907
00:52:06,455 --> 00:52:10,118
- I filed it. It went down.
- You filed it?

908
00:52:10,192 --> 00:52:12,558
- James Lingk?
- Yes.

909
00:52:12,628 --> 00:52:14,562
- It was sent downtown?
- Yes, all right?

910
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:16,564
I filed it last night.
It went to the bank.

911
00:52:16,632 --> 00:52:18,998
- It went downtown, all right?
- You filed it?

912
00:52:19,068 --> 00:52:21,730
Then I'm over the fucking top,
you owe me a Cadillac.

913
00:52:21,804 --> 00:52:23,999
- I don't...
- I don't want to hear any shit.

914
00:52:24,073 --> 00:52:27,042
I don't give a shit.
Lingk puts me over the top.

915
00:52:27,109 --> 00:52:30,101
You filed it. It went downtown.
Now you owe me the car.

916
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:33,148
- The robbery makes difficult...
- Fuck you! You owe me the car!

917
00:52:33,215 --> 00:52:35,843
See, 'cause this is how
we keep score, "bubby."

918
00:52:35,918 --> 00:52:39,081
You told me, "Close thus,
and so you get the car."

919
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:42,147
- I got it.
- Would you excuse us, please?

920
00:52:42,224 --> 00:52:45,159
You hear what I said?
Do you hear what I said?

921
00:52:45,227 --> 00:52:48,754
Hey, pal!
Your excuses are your own!

922
00:52:59,508 --> 00:53:02,033
"Recontact James Lingk.

923
00:53:02,111 --> 00:53:05,945
6:00 p.m. Morton Grove."
Ah-ha.

924
00:53:06,015 --> 00:53:08,506
When do you expect
her in?

925
00:53:08,584 --> 00:53:11,314
This is Ricky Roma
from last night.

926
00:53:11,387 --> 00:53:14,481
She'll remember.
Just, just... wait a minute!

927
00:53:14,557 --> 00:53:17,890
Just to say... to thank her
for a wonderful time.

928
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,428
Thank you.
I'll call back later. Thank you.

929
00:53:20,496 --> 00:53:22,896
They should check
if we're insured.

930
00:53:25,234 --> 00:53:27,896
Uh-huh.

931
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:30,905
"10:00 p.m., Octavia."

932
00:53:30,973 --> 00:53:33,999
Please don't leave.
I'm going to talk to you.

933
00:53:34,076 --> 00:53:36,943
- What's your name?
- Are you talking to me?

934
00:53:37,012 --> 00:53:40,004
- That's right.
- My name is Richard Roma.

935
00:53:51,827 --> 00:53:54,489
L... you know,
they should be insured.

936
00:53:54,563 --> 00:53:57,031
- What do you care?
- Then they wouldn't be so upset.

937
00:53:57,099 --> 00:53:59,624
- Huh?
- They wouldn't be so upset.

938
00:53:59,702 --> 00:54:02,296
- Mitch and Murray.
- Yeah, you're right.

939
00:54:02,371 --> 00:54:04,202
That's right.
How are you?

940
00:54:04,273 --> 00:54:06,503
I'm fine.

941
00:54:06,575 --> 00:54:09,043
You mean the board?
You mean on the board?

942
00:54:10,813 --> 00:54:14,044
Yes. Okay.
The board.

943
00:54:14,116 --> 00:54:16,607
I'm fucked on the board.
I can't...

944
00:54:18,921 --> 00:54:21,515
My mind must be other places,
'cause I can't...

945
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:23,990
What?
You can't do what?

946
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:26,857
- I can't close them.
- Well, they're old.

947
00:54:26,929 --> 00:54:30,592
Look, look at this shit
they're giving you. Huh?

948
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:32,896
- Yes, they are old.
- They're ancient.

949
00:54:32,968 --> 00:54:35,436
"Clear Meadows."
This shit's dead.

950
00:54:35,504 --> 00:54:36,869
- It is dead.
- Waste of time.

951
00:54:36,939 --> 00:54:41,399
- Yes. I'm no fucking good.
- Hey, fuck that shit, George.

952
00:54:41,477 --> 00:54:43,741
You had a bad month.
You're a good man.

953
00:54:43,812 --> 00:54:45,575
- I am?
- Yeah, you had a bad streak.

954
00:54:45,648 --> 00:54:49,414
Look at this. 15 units, Mountain View,
the fucking things get stolen.

955
00:54:49,485 --> 00:54:53,114
- He said he filed...
- He filed the big one.

956
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:55,350
He filed the guy from the bar
that I closed last night.

957
00:54:55,424 --> 00:54:57,915
All the little ones,
I got to go back.

958
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:02,926
Can you believe this?
I got to go back and close again.

959
00:55:02,998 --> 00:55:05,592
I mean, talk about
a fucking beat

960
00:55:05,668 --> 00:55:09,263
that would sap anyone's... wait,
wait, wait. Where are the phones?

961
00:55:09,338 --> 00:55:12,171
- They stole...
- They stole...?

962
00:55:12,241 --> 00:55:14,766
- What kind of an outfit is it...
- They stole the phones.

963
00:55:14,843 --> 00:55:17,607
...when criminals come and they take...
they steal the phones?

964
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,875
They stole the leads.
They stole the phones,

965
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:22,577
they stole... aw, Christ.

966
00:55:22,651 --> 00:55:26,883
What am I going
to do this month? Shit.

967
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:28,924
You think they're going to catch...
where are you going?

968
00:55:28,991 --> 00:55:31,152
Down the street.

969
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:37,157
- Where are you going?
- To the... what do you fucking care?

970
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:41,670
- Aren't you going out today?
- With what, John? With what?

971
00:55:41,737 --> 00:55:44,934
Well, answer me.
They stole the Glengarry leads.

972
00:55:45,007 --> 00:55:48,465
- They stole Rio Rancho.
- I have stuff from last year's file.

973
00:55:48,544 --> 00:55:51,775
Oh, oh, oh.
Your "nostalgia" file.

974
00:55:51,847 --> 00:55:54,577
Oh, great. That's great,
'cause I don't...

975
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:56,880
- Do you want to go out today?
- I don't have to eat this month.

976
00:55:56,952 --> 00:55:59,546
Great.
Give them to me.

977
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:03,058
Bring them.
Come on.

978
00:56:04,426 --> 00:56:08,089
Fucking Mitch and Murray
are going to shit a...

979
00:56:08,163 --> 00:56:11,326
What am I going
to do all month?

980
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,698
See, the thing
of it is,

981
00:56:13,769 --> 00:56:16,237
is were the leads insured?
You think?

982
00:56:16,305 --> 00:56:19,240
- What?
- Were the leads insured?

983
00:56:19,308 --> 00:56:21,674
I don't know, why?

984
00:56:21,744 --> 00:56:23,644
'Cause if they weren't,
I know Mitch and Murray...

985
00:56:23,712 --> 00:56:26,078
- What?
- They'll be upset.

986
00:56:26,148 --> 00:56:28,639
That's right.

987
00:56:28,717 --> 00:56:30,912
You're right.

988
00:56:32,154 --> 00:56:34,679
He said we're all going
to have to talk to the guy.

989
00:56:34,757 --> 00:56:36,315
- To...
- The cop.

990
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:38,451
Great. We have to talk
to the cop.

991
00:56:38,527 --> 00:56:42,190
- Another waste of time.
- A waste of time? Why?

992
00:56:42,264 --> 00:56:44,198
Why? 'Cause they're not going
to find the guy.

993
00:56:44,266 --> 00:56:48,134
- The cops?
- Yes, the cops. No.

994
00:56:48,203 --> 00:56:49,864
The cops aren't going
to find the guy?

995
00:56:49,938 --> 00:56:51,701
- Nope.
- Why do you think so?

996
00:56:51,774 --> 00:56:53,298
Why? Because they are stupid.
Where were you last night?

997
00:56:55,544 --> 00:56:57,876
- Where were you?
- Where was I?

998
00:56:57,913 --> 00:56:59,005
- Yeah.
- I was at home.

999
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:00,140
- Where were you?
- At home.

1000
00:57:00,215 --> 00:57:02,080
See? Were you the guy
who broke in?

1001
00:57:02,151 --> 00:57:03,209
- Was I?
- Yes.

1002
00:57:03,285 --> 00:57:05,480
- No.
- Then don't sweat it. You know why?

1003
00:57:05,554 --> 00:57:07,681
- No.
- You have nothing to hide.

1004
00:57:07,756 --> 00:57:10,452
- When I talk to police, I get nervous.
- Yes, you know who doesn't?

1005
00:57:10,526 --> 00:57:13,086
- No. Who?
- Thieves.

1006
00:57:13,162 --> 00:57:15,130
I don't know
what I'm going to tell them.

1007
00:57:15,164 --> 00:57:17,530
The truth.
Always tell them the truth.

1008
00:57:17,566 --> 00:57:19,591
It's the easiest thing
to remember.

1009
00:57:20,169 --> 00:57:23,195
Whoa, whoa!
"Patel"?

1010
00:57:23,272 --> 00:57:25,740
"Ravidam Patel"?

1011
00:57:25,808 --> 00:57:27,605
How am I going to make a living
on these deadbeats?

1012
00:57:27,676 --> 00:57:29,644
- Where did you get this from, a morgue?
- Look, I'm...

1013
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:32,875
Come on. What's the point?
What's the fucking point?

1014
00:57:32,948 --> 00:57:35,815
I got to argue with you,
I got to knock heads with the cops,

1015
00:57:35,884 --> 00:57:37,715
I'm busting my balls
to sell your dirt

1016
00:57:37,786 --> 00:57:40,584
to deadbeats...
money in the mattress.

1017
00:57:40,656 --> 00:57:43,147
I come back, you can't even
keep the contracts safe.

1018
00:57:43,225 --> 00:57:45,420
I got to go out...
fuck this shit.

1019
00:57:45,494 --> 00:57:47,291
I'm going to go out
and re-close last week's stuff.

1020
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:49,422
No, the word from Murray
is leave them alone.

1021
00:57:49,498 --> 00:57:51,693
If he needs a new sig,
he'll go out himself.

1022
00:57:51,767 --> 00:57:54,736
- Murray's gonna go out?
- He'll be "president of the company

1023
00:57:54,803 --> 00:57:57,135
just in from out of town,"
all right?

1024
00:57:58,674 --> 00:58:01,700
Okay, okay, okay.
Give me this shit.

1025
00:58:01,777 --> 00:58:04,211
- I'm giving you three leads.
- Three? I count two.

1026
00:58:04,279 --> 00:58:06,509
- There's three leads there.
- Patel? Fuck you.

1027
00:58:06,582 --> 00:58:09,608
Fucking Shiva handed
this guy a million dollars,

1028
00:58:09,685 --> 00:58:11,915
told him, "Sign the deal,"
he wouldn't sign.

1029
00:58:11,987 --> 00:58:14,751
And the god Vishnu, too,
into the bargain. Fuck you.

1030
00:58:14,823 --> 00:58:17,656
You know your business, I know mine.
Your business is being an asshole.

1031
00:58:17,726 --> 00:58:20,320
If I find out whose fucking cousin
you are, I'm gonna go to him

1032
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:24,628
and figure out a way
to have your ass... fuck you!

1033
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:27,328
I'm waiting
for the new leads.

1034
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:34,902
Get the chalk!
Hey! Get the chalk!

1035
00:58:34,977 --> 00:58:36,842
Get the...
I did it... I closed 'em.

1036
00:58:36,912 --> 00:58:38,675
I closed the cocksucker.
Get the chalk.

1037
00:58:38,747 --> 00:58:42,274
Put me on the board, John.
Put me on the Cadillac board!

1038
00:58:42,351 --> 00:58:45,047
Williamson,
pick up the fucking chalk.

1039
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:49,181
- Rick... eight units, Mountain View.
- You sold eight Mountain View?

1040
00:58:49,258 --> 00:58:51,590
You bet your ass!
Who wants to go to lunch?

1041
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,787
Who wants to go to lunch...
I'm buying.

1042
00:58:53,862 --> 00:58:57,559
Williamson... $82,000,
12 grand in my commission.

1043
00:58:57,633 --> 00:58:59,897
On deadbeat
magazine subscription leads.

1044
00:58:59,968 --> 00:59:02,596
- Who?
- Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.

1045
00:59:02,671 --> 00:59:05,071
Read it.
What the hell happened here?

1046
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:07,301
Fuck! I had them
on River Glen.

1047
00:59:07,376 --> 00:59:09,139
- What happened?
- Somebody broke in.

1048
00:59:09,211 --> 00:59:11,372
- Eight units!
- Yeah.

1049
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:14,348
- Shelly!
- Big deal... I broke a bad streak.

1050
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:16,646
Shelly "The Machine" Levene.
That's great.

1051
00:59:16,718 --> 00:59:18,652
Thank you, George.
Hey...

1052
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,154
- grab the phone, call Mitch.
- They took the phones.

1053
00:59:21,223 --> 00:59:22,815
- Huh?
- Aaronow?

1054
00:59:22,858 --> 00:59:25,122
They took the leads,
the cash, the contracts.

1055
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:27,025
- We had a robbery.
- When?

1056
00:59:27,095 --> 00:59:29,791
- Last night, this morning.
- They took the leads?

1057
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:34,592
Fucking asshole.

1058
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:36,831
What? They beat you
with a rubber bat?

1059
00:59:36,905 --> 00:59:39,237
Cop couldn't find his dick
with two hands and a map.

1060
00:59:39,308 --> 00:59:41,674
Anybody who talks to this asshole
is a fucking asshole.

1061
00:59:41,743 --> 00:59:43,836
- You gonna turn state's?
- Fuck you, Ricky.

1062
00:59:43,912 --> 00:59:46,779
I ain't going out today.
I'm going home.

1063
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:49,181
I'm going home because nothing's
accomplished here.

1064
00:59:49,251 --> 00:59:51,276
- Anybody talks to this guy...
- Guess what "The Machine" did.

1065
00:59:51,353 --> 00:59:54,686
- Fuck "The Machine."
- Mountain View, eight units.

1066
00:59:54,756 --> 00:59:57,850
Cop's got no right to talk to me
that way. I did not rob the place.

1067
00:59:57,926 --> 01:00:01,054
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yeah, he closed the deal.

1068
01:00:01,129 --> 01:00:03,495
Eight units,
Mountain View.

1069
01:00:03,565 --> 01:00:06,090
- You did that?
- Yeah.

1070
01:00:07,302 --> 01:00:09,429
- Fuck you.
- Guess who?

1071
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:11,097
- When?
- Just now.

1072
01:00:11,173 --> 01:00:13,471
- Guess who?
- You just... this morning?

1073
01:00:13,542 --> 01:00:16,033
Harriett
and blah blah Nyborg.

1074
01:00:16,111 --> 01:00:19,342
- You did that?
- Yeah... $82,000.

1075
01:00:20,449 --> 01:00:24,010
- Those fucking deadbeats.
- My ass. I told 'em... listen to this.

1076
01:00:24,086 --> 01:00:27,249
- I don't want to hear your war stories.
- Fuck you, Dave.

1077
01:00:27,322 --> 01:00:29,756
I said, "You have to believe
in yourself."

1078
01:00:29,825 --> 01:00:32,225
Give me a lead.
I'm going out. I'm getting out.

1079
01:00:32,294 --> 01:00:37,129
- Fuck the leads. I'm going home.
- "Fuck me, Bruce.

1080
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:38,757
- You have to believe in yourself."
- We haven't got a lead.

1081
01:00:38,834 --> 01:00:41,302
- Why not?
- They took 'em.

1082
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:43,964
They're fucking garbage, any case.
The whole goddamn...

1083
01:00:44,039 --> 01:00:47,372
"You look around, you say,
'This one has so-and-so. I got nothing.

1084
01:00:47,442 --> 01:00:49,933
But why? Why don't I get
the opportunities? '"

1085
01:00:50,012 --> 01:00:52,606
- Did they steal the contracts?
- What the fuck do you care?

1086
01:00:52,681 --> 01:00:54,478
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

1087
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:56,575
Will you shut up?
I'm telling him something.

1088
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,181
Could we get
some coffee?

1089
01:01:00,255 --> 01:01:02,416
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

1090
01:01:04,393 --> 01:01:05,587
Uh-huh.

1091
01:01:05,661 --> 01:01:07,561
Anybody's going out,
I could use some coffee.

1092
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:13,424
- "You do get the opportunity."
- Fuck is that supposed to mean?

1093
01:01:13,502 --> 01:01:15,800
"You do get the opportunities.
You get 'em as I get 'em,

1094
01:01:16,271 --> 01:01:18,603
- as everybody gets 'em."
- I don't care they stole the contracts?

1095
01:01:18,674 --> 01:01:20,801
I got 'em in the kitchen,
eating their crumb cake...

1096
01:01:20,876 --> 01:01:23,106
- What does that mean?
- It means, Dave,

1097
01:01:23,178 --> 01:01:25,408
You haven't closed
a good one in a month.

1098
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,311
None of my business,
you want to push me to answer you.

1099
01:01:27,382 --> 01:01:30,442
So you haven't got a contract
to get stolen and so forth.

1100
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:33,352
You got a mean streak in you.
Shut the fuck up!

1101
01:01:33,422 --> 01:01:36,619
Ricky, you got a mean streak in you,
and what are you babbling about?

1102
01:01:36,692 --> 01:01:38,557
You bring that shit up...
on my volume?

1103
01:01:38,627 --> 01:01:41,790
If you were on a bad one and I
brought it up to you, you'd harbor it.

1104
01:01:41,863 --> 01:01:44,331
You'd harbor it a long while
and you'd be right.

1105
01:01:44,399 --> 01:01:46,765
- Who said "Fuck 'The Machine'"?
- Fuck "The Machine"?

1106
01:01:46,835 --> 01:01:49,360
Fuck "The Machine"?
Fuck "The Machine"!

1107
01:01:49,438 --> 01:01:52,805
What is this, courtesy class?
You're fucked, Rick.

1108
01:01:52,874 --> 01:01:55,638
Are you fucking nuts?
You're hot, so you think

1109
01:01:55,711 --> 01:01:57,303
- you're the ruler of this place.
- Wait a minute, Dave.

1110
01:01:57,379 --> 01:01:59,142
- Shut up!
- Okay...

1111
01:01:59,214 --> 01:02:01,705
You want to decide who
should be dealt with how, is that it?

1112
01:02:01,783 --> 01:02:04,684
I come into the office today,
I get humiliated by some jag-off cop.

1113
01:02:04,753 --> 01:02:06,653
I get accused of...

1114
01:02:06,722 --> 01:02:10,385
I get shit thrown in my face because
you're top name on the board?

1115
01:02:10,459 --> 01:02:13,326
Is that what I did, Dave...
I humiliated you?

1116
01:02:13,395 --> 01:02:16,922
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- Sitting on top of the world.

1117
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:19,866
Sitting on top of the world...
everything's fucking peach fuzz.

1118
01:02:19,935 --> 01:02:23,166
I don't get a moment to spare
for some bust-out humanitarian

1119
01:02:23,238 --> 01:02:25,035
- down on his luck lately?
- Fuck you!

1120
01:02:25,107 --> 01:02:26,904
Fuck you, Dave...
you know you got a big mouth.

1121
01:02:26,975 --> 01:02:30,206
You make a close, this whole place
stinks with your farts for a week...

1122
01:02:30,278 --> 01:02:34,612
how much you just ingested.
Oh, what a big man you are!

1123
01:02:34,683 --> 01:02:37,379
"Let me buy you a pack of gum...
I'll show you how to chew it."

1124
01:02:37,452 --> 01:02:40,421
Your pal closes, and all that comes
out of your mouth is bile.

1125
01:02:40,489 --> 01:02:43,652
How fucked-up you are!

1126
01:02:43,725 --> 01:02:48,594
Who's my pal, Ricky? Hmm?
And what are you?

1127
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:51,997
What are you, huh,
Bishop Sheen?

1128
01:02:52,067 --> 01:02:54,160
What the fuck are you,
"Mr. Slick"?

1129
01:02:54,236 --> 01:02:56,864
What the fuck are you,
"Friend to the working man"?

1130
01:02:56,938 --> 01:02:59,304
Big deal!
Fuck you!

1131
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:03,874
You got the memory
of a fucking fly!

1132
01:03:05,947 --> 01:03:08,882
I never liked you,
anyway.

1133
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:11,077
What is this,
your farewell speech?

1134
01:03:11,153 --> 01:03:13,553
- I'm going home.
- Your farewell to the troops?

1135
01:03:13,622 --> 01:03:15,453
I'm not going home.
I'm going to Wisconsin.

1136
01:03:15,524 --> 01:03:18,015
- Have a good trip.
- Aw, fuck you!

1137
01:03:18,727 --> 01:03:21,525
Fuck the lot of you!
Fuck you all!

1138
01:03:25,734 --> 01:03:27,565
You were saying?

1139
01:03:27,636 --> 01:03:30,332
Huh?

1140
01:03:30,405 --> 01:03:32,236
Come on.

1141
01:03:32,307 --> 01:03:34,571
Come on... you got 'em
in the kitchen,

1142
01:03:34,643 --> 01:03:37,271
you're in
your shirtsleeves,

1143
01:03:37,345 --> 01:03:39,643
you got
the stats spread out,

1144
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:42,980
you can smell it.
Come on, snap out of it.

1145
01:03:43,051 --> 01:03:46,418
- You're eating her crumb cake.
- Oh yeah, I'm eating her crumb cake.

1146
01:03:46,488 --> 01:03:49,616
- How was it?
- From the store.

1147
01:03:49,691 --> 01:03:52,251
- Fuck her.
- "Bruce, Harriett...

1148
01:03:52,327 --> 01:03:56,195
we have to admit to ourselves
that we see that opportunity

1149
01:03:56,264 --> 01:03:59,722
and take it... and that's it."
Now, we just sit there.

1150
01:03:59,801 --> 01:04:01,598
- I got my pen out.
- "Always Be Closing."

1151
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:04,161
God, that's what
I've been saying... the old ways.

1152
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:07,766
Convert that motherfucker,
sell him, make him sign the check.

1153
01:04:07,843 --> 01:04:09,708
They got their money
in government bonds...

1154
01:04:09,778 --> 01:04:13,373
I said, "Fuck it... let's go
all the way, the whole route."

1155
01:04:13,448 --> 01:04:17,748
I take it and plat it out... eight units,
82 grand, and I say to them,

1156
01:04:17,819 --> 01:04:22,916
"This is now. This is that thing
that you have been dreaming of.

1157
01:04:22,991 --> 01:04:25,482
You are going to find
the suitcase on the train.

1158
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:28,791
The man walks in the room,
that bag is filled with money.

1159
01:04:28,864 --> 01:04:32,391
Harriett, this is it, and Bruce...
I don't want to fuck around with you.

1160
01:04:32,467 --> 01:04:35,664
No, I don't. I don't want
to pussyfoot around.

1161
01:04:35,737 --> 01:04:38,968
You think you got to look back
on this thing? I do, too.

1162
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:42,476
Now, I'm here to do good
for you and me... the both of us.

1163
01:04:42,544 --> 01:04:45,843
What is the point
of some interim position?

1164
01:04:45,914 --> 01:04:49,509
The only arrangement
I will accept is full investment.

1165
01:04:49,584 --> 01:04:52,644
And I mean it, that's it...
all eight units. Period."

1166
01:04:52,721 --> 01:04:55,315
Now I got the pen
in my hand, Rick... hey.

1167
01:04:55,390 --> 01:05:00,225
I turned that contract around...
that's eight units, 82 grand...

1168
01:05:00,295 --> 01:05:04,356
and I said,
"I want you to sign."

1169
01:05:04,432 --> 01:05:07,458
I sat there five minutes.

1170
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:12,940
Then I sat 22 minutes
by that kitchen clock on the wall.

1171
01:05:13,008 --> 01:05:15,806
Ricky... not a word,
not a motion.

1172
01:05:15,877 --> 01:05:18,539
And what am I thinking?
"Is my arm getting tired?"

1173
01:05:18,613 --> 01:05:21,446
No. I did it.
Just like the old days,

1174
01:05:21,516 --> 01:05:23,143
like I used to,
like I was taught.

1175
01:05:23,218 --> 01:05:25,311
- I did it.
- Like you taught me.

1176
01:05:25,387 --> 01:05:28,447
Nobody ever...
well, if I did, I'm glad.

1177
01:05:28,523 --> 01:05:30,582
No, what I did...
I locked on 'em.

1178
01:05:30,659 --> 01:05:33,287
I locked all on them...
nothing on me... on them.

1179
01:05:33,361 --> 01:05:36,455
And, oh God, I am holding
my last thought,

1180
01:05:36,531 --> 01:05:39,193
"Now is the time."

1181
01:05:40,268 --> 01:05:43,863
They signed.
It was great.

1182
01:05:43,939 --> 01:05:46,635
It was so fucking great.

1183
01:05:46,708 --> 01:05:50,610
It was like
they wilted all at once.

1184
01:05:50,679 --> 01:05:53,307
- Mmm.
- No gesture, nothing... just together.

1185
01:05:53,381 --> 01:05:58,478
Honest to God, they both
imperceptibly slumped.

1186
01:05:58,553 --> 01:06:02,182
And then he reached
and he took the pen and he signed,

1187
01:06:02,257 --> 01:06:04,384
passed it to her
and she signed.

1188
01:06:04,459 --> 01:06:06,723
It was solemn...
fucking solemn.

1189
01:06:06,795 --> 01:06:11,789
I let it sit, and then I nodded.
I said, "Harriett, Bruce,"

1190
01:06:11,867 --> 01:06:14,301
then I pointed into the living room
to the sideboard.

1191
01:06:14,369 --> 01:06:16,599
I didn't know there was
a sideboard in there.

1192
01:06:16,671 --> 01:06:18,662
He went over,
he brought us back a drink...

1193
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:22,232
little shot glasses
with a pretty design in 'em.

1194
01:06:23,845 --> 01:06:27,474
And we just toasted
in silence.

1195
01:06:27,549 --> 01:06:31,007
Great sale, Shelly.

1196
01:06:31,086 --> 01:06:33,111
Great.

1197
01:06:33,188 --> 01:06:36,123
Fuck! Send me out!
Give me leads!

1198
01:06:36,191 --> 01:06:37,215
- Williamson! Send me out!
- Whoa!

1199
01:06:37,926 --> 01:06:39,917
- The leads are coming.
- Get 'em to me.

1200
01:06:39,995 --> 01:06:42,623
I talked to Mitch and Murray
an hour ago. They're coming in.

1201
01:06:42,697 --> 01:06:45,325
- They're a bit upset over this.
- Did you tell 'em my sale?

1202
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,800
How could I tell 'em your sale?
I didn't have a tele...

1203
01:06:47,869 --> 01:06:50,201
I'll tell 'em your sale
when they bring in the leads.

1204
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:53,207
We had a little... you closed the deal,
you made a good sale. Fine.

1205
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:56,176
- Better than a good sale.
- I have a lot of things on my mind.

1206
01:06:56,244 --> 01:06:59,441
They're coming and they're very upset.
I'm trying to make...

1207
01:06:59,514 --> 01:07:02,278
All I'm telling you is, you can tell
them it was a remarkably good sale.

1208
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:05,080
The only thing remarkable
about it is who you made it to.

1209
01:07:05,153 --> 01:07:08,611
- What the fuck does that mean?
- If the sale sticks it'll be a miracle.

1210
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:10,988
"If the sale sticks"?
Why shouldn't the sale stick?

1211
01:07:11,059 --> 01:07:15,086
Oh, fuck you!
You do not know your job.

1212
01:07:15,163 --> 01:07:16,994
Do you know that?
A man is his job!

1213
01:07:17,065 --> 01:07:20,057
You are fucked at yours.
You hear what I'm saying to you?

1214
01:07:20,135 --> 01:07:22,228
Your "End of the Month"
fucking boar...

1215
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:24,101
you do not know how
to run this office.

1216
01:07:24,172 --> 01:07:26,572
You haven't got the sense.
You haven't got the balls.

1217
01:07:26,641 --> 01:07:29,804
Have you ever been on a sit?
Has this cocksucker been on a sit?

1218
01:07:29,878 --> 01:07:32,608
- Did you ever sit...
- If I were you, I would calm down.

1219
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:34,649
Would you?
What are you gonna do, fire me?

1220
01:07:34,716 --> 01:07:36,616
Oh, oh, Rick, ooh.

1221
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:39,950
- It's not impossible.
- Really? On an $80,000 day?

1222
01:07:40,021 --> 01:07:42,489
- It's not even noon yet.
- You closed 'em today?

1223
01:07:42,557 --> 01:07:45,219
I got up early this morning,
tracked 'em down, and closed it.

1224
01:07:45,293 --> 01:07:48,592
What I'm saying to you
is that things change.

1225
01:07:48,663 --> 01:07:52,030
That's where you fuck up.
You don't know. You can't look back.

1226
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:56,161
You don't see who's coming.
Maybe it's someone new, huh?

1227
01:07:56,237 --> 01:07:58,398
Maybe it's someone else,
but you don't know...

1228
01:07:58,473 --> 01:08:01,135
you can't look back, because
you don't know your history!

1229
01:08:01,209 --> 01:08:03,575
When we were on Rio Rancho,
who was the top man, huh?

1230
01:08:03,645 --> 01:08:05,579
For what,
two months, three months?

1231
01:08:05,647 --> 01:08:08,616
How about eight months,
for three years in a row!

1232
01:08:08,683 --> 01:08:12,449
Luck... was that it, John?
Or purloined fucking leads?

1233
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:14,351
- It was talent!
- Yes.

1234
01:08:14,422 --> 01:08:17,983
Door to door.
It's called "cold calling," John.

1235
01:08:18,059 --> 01:08:21,426
Shit, I don't even know their name.
They don't want to buy what I've got.

1236
01:08:21,496 --> 01:08:24,192
Soft sell... we were doing it
before we had a name for it.

1237
01:08:24,265 --> 01:08:26,130
- Am I right?
- You're right, you're right.

1238
01:08:26,201 --> 01:08:30,069
You wouldn't know, you cock...
he doesn't even know what a streak is.

1239
01:08:30,138 --> 01:08:32,504
What the hell are you?

1240
01:08:32,574 --> 01:08:35,304
You're a fucking secretary.
Fuck you!

1241
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:38,778
That's my message to you...
fuck you, and kiss my ass.

1242
01:08:38,847 --> 01:08:42,613
If you don't like that, I go across
the street and speak to Jerry Graff.

1243
01:08:42,684 --> 01:08:44,549
Period. Fuck you.

1244
01:08:44,619 --> 01:08:47,782
Listen to me... you put me
on that fucking board,

1245
01:08:47,856 --> 01:08:50,324
and I want three
promising leads for today,

1246
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:53,418
I don't want any bullshit,
and I want 'em close together,

1247
01:08:53,495 --> 01:08:55,656
because I am
going to close them all.

1248
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:58,961
And that's all I have
to say to you.

1249
01:09:00,301 --> 01:09:03,327
He's right, Williamson.

1250
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:09,205
I'm sorry, but it's wrong,
and you know whose fault it is?

1251
01:09:09,277 --> 01:09:10,869
Mitch and Murray.

1252
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:16,179
To hell with him.
Let's get some lunch, huh, Rick?

1253
01:09:16,251 --> 01:09:18,412
The leads won't be
up here till later anyway.

1254
01:09:18,486 --> 01:09:21,853
You're a client. I just sold you
five waterfront Glengarry Farms.

1255
01:09:21,923 --> 01:09:24,721
I do this with my hair,
throw me the cue "Kenilworth."

1256
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:27,227
- Which is it?
- Kenilworth.

1257
01:09:27,295 --> 01:09:29,991
I own the property.
My mother owns the property.

1258
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:31,828
I put her into it.

1259
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:35,097
You look on the plats
when you go home. You'll see...

1260
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:37,900
A-3 through 10,
26 through 30.

1261
01:09:37,972 --> 01:09:41,703
- Take your time. If you still feel...
- I won't need more time, Rick.

1262
01:09:41,776 --> 01:09:43,869
- I've bought a lot of property.
- I've got to talk to you.

1263
01:09:43,945 --> 01:09:46,379
Jim, what are you
doing here?

1264
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:49,679
Jim Lingk,
D. Ray Morton.

1265
01:09:49,751 --> 01:09:52,811
- I'm glad to meet you.
- I put Jim into Black Creek.

1266
01:09:52,887 --> 01:09:55,788
- Are you acquainted with...
- Black Creek? No.

1267
01:09:55,857 --> 01:09:57,654
- Ooh, in Florida!
- Yes.

1268
01:09:57,725 --> 01:10:00,888
- I meant to speak to you about that.
- We'll do that this weekend.

1269
01:10:00,962 --> 01:10:02,691
My wife suggested
I look into it.

1270
01:10:02,764 --> 01:10:05,528
Beautiful rolling land...
I was telling Jim and Jinny.

1271
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,001
Ray, I got to tell you something.
You eat in a lot of restaurants?

1272
01:10:09,070 --> 01:10:11,937
I know you do.
Ray is with American Express.

1273
01:10:12,006 --> 01:10:13,871
- Can I tell Jim what you do?
- Sure.

1274
01:10:13,942 --> 01:10:17,400
Ray is the director of all
European sales and services...

1275
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:20,539
what I'm saying is, you haven't had
a meal until you've tasted...

1276
01:10:20,615 --> 01:10:22,412
I was at the Lingks'...

1277
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:24,952
what was that service feature
you were talking about?

1278
01:10:25,019 --> 01:10:26,714
- Which...
- "Home cooking."

1279
01:10:26,788 --> 01:10:29,621
- You had a tag phrase you used?
- "Cooking"...

1280
01:10:29,691 --> 01:10:31,318
"Home cook..."
the monthly interview.

1281
01:10:31,392 --> 01:10:33,553
- The magazine!
- Yes.

1282
01:10:33,628 --> 01:10:35,994
Is that something
I can talk about?

1283
01:10:36,064 --> 01:10:39,261
It won't be out until
the February issue, but go ahead.

1284
01:10:39,334 --> 01:10:40,995
- Are you sure?
- Go ahead.

1285
01:10:41,069 --> 01:10:44,095
Ray was eating at one of his
company men's homes in France.

1286
01:10:44,172 --> 01:10:46,231
- The man is French?
- No, but his wife is.

1287
01:10:46,307 --> 01:10:47,934
His wife.

1288
01:10:48,009 --> 01:10:50,603
Ray, what time
do you have?

1289
01:10:50,678 --> 01:10:53,476
- 12:15.
- I got to get you on the plane.

1290
01:10:53,548 --> 01:10:55,345
- Didn't I say the 2:00?
- No, the 1:00.

1291
01:10:55,416 --> 01:10:58,351
Remember the 1:00... that's why
we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.

1292
01:10:58,419 --> 01:11:00,546
You're right, the 1:00...
let's scoot.

1293
01:11:00,622 --> 01:11:02,749
- A pleasure.
- I got to talk to you.

1294
01:11:02,824 --> 01:11:05,918
I got to run Ray to the airport.
Let's hustle... John!

1295
01:11:05,994 --> 01:11:09,521
Get on the phone to Pittsburgh,
American Express there, for Mr. Morton.

1296
01:11:09,597 --> 01:11:12,896
Tell them he's on the 1:00.
I'll see you.

1297
01:11:12,967 --> 01:11:15,435
Christ, I'm sorry
you came all the way in.

1298
01:11:15,503 --> 01:11:18,563
I'm running Ray to the airport.
You wait here and...

1299
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,234
no, I can't. I'm meeting your man
at the bank.

1300
01:11:21,309 --> 01:11:25,143
I wish you'd have phoned!
Are you and Jinny going to be home?

1301
01:11:25,213 --> 01:11:26,646
- I don't know.
- Rick?

1302
01:11:26,714 --> 01:11:28,238
- What?
- Kenilworth?

1303
01:11:28,316 --> 01:11:30,045
- I'm sorry?
- Kenilworth.

1304
01:11:30,118 --> 01:11:33,019
Oh, God. Excuse me, Ray...
just a minute.

1305
01:11:33,087 --> 01:11:37,615
Jim, I told you who he is... the senior
vice-president of American Express.

1306
01:11:37,692 --> 01:11:39,887
His family owns 32 per...

1307
01:11:39,961 --> 01:11:43,863
over the past years, I have sold him...
I can't tell you the dollar amount...

1308
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:46,594
but quite a lot of land.

1309
01:11:46,668 --> 01:11:50,126
I promised him five weeks ago that I
would go to the wife's birthday party

1310
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:52,730
in Kenilworth tonight.
I have to go, you understand?

1311
01:11:52,807 --> 01:11:55,901
They treat me like a member
of the family. I have to go.

1312
01:11:55,977 --> 01:12:00,175
It's funny... you get a picture
of the corporation-type company man,

1313
01:12:00,248 --> 01:12:02,716
all business...
this guy, I'll tell you.

1314
01:12:02,784 --> 01:12:04,718
We'll go to his house
someday.

1315
01:12:04,786 --> 01:12:08,950
Let me see. Tomorrow.
I'm in L.A.?

1316
01:12:09,023 --> 01:12:11,355
Ah, Monday.

1317
01:12:11,426 --> 01:12:13,792
I'll take you to lunch.
Where would you like to eat?

1318
01:12:13,861 --> 01:12:15,294
- My wife...
- Rick?

1319
01:12:15,363 --> 01:12:18,662
I can't talk now, Jim...
I'll call you tonight. Coming, Ray.

1320
01:12:18,733 --> 01:12:21,031
My wife said I have
to cancel the deal.

1321
01:12:22,737 --> 01:12:25,297
That's a common reaction, Jim,
and let me tell you what it is.

1322
01:12:25,373 --> 01:12:28,240
That's why you married her.
One of the reasons is prudence.

1323
01:12:28,309 --> 01:12:31,073
No, it's a sizable investment.
One thinks twice.

1324
01:12:31,145 --> 01:12:36,082
It's also something women have.
Reaction to the size of the investment.

1325
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:38,415
Monday, you invite me
to dinner again...

1326
01:12:38,486 --> 01:12:40,386
- This woman can cook.
- I'm sure she can.

1327
01:12:40,455 --> 01:12:43,151
We are going to talk.
I want to tell you something.

1328
01:12:43,224 --> 01:12:46,284
Something about your acreage
I want you to know.

1329
01:12:46,361 --> 01:12:50,127
I can't talk about it here,
I really shouldn't, and by law...

1330
01:12:50,198 --> 01:12:54,532
the man next to you...
bought his lot at 42...

1331
01:12:54,602 --> 01:12:56,627
phoned to say
he already had an offer.

1332
01:12:56,704 --> 01:12:58,365
- Rick.
- I'm coming.

1333
01:12:58,439 --> 01:13:00,930
Ray, what a day.
I'll call you this evening.

1334
01:13:01,009 --> 01:13:04,308
I'm sorry you had to come
all the way in. Monday lunch.

1335
01:13:04,379 --> 01:13:06,074
- We have to go.
- Monday!

1336
01:13:06,147 --> 01:13:09,844
She called the consumer...
the attorney general?

1337
01:13:09,917 --> 01:13:12,317
- They said we have three days.
- Who'd she call?

1338
01:13:12,387 --> 01:13:15,481
The attorney ge...
it was some consumer office.

1339
01:13:16,624 --> 01:13:18,956
Why'd she do that, Jim?

1340
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:20,858
I don't know.

1341
01:13:20,928 --> 01:13:22,759
But they said
we have three days.

1342
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:25,924
They said
we got three days, yeah.

1343
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,025
Three days?

1344
01:13:28,102 --> 01:13:32,163
- To... you know.
- No, I don't know.

1345
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:35,767
- Tell me.
- To change our minds.

1346
01:13:35,843 --> 01:13:38,778
Of course you have...
three days.

1347
01:13:38,846 --> 01:13:41,314
So we can't talk Monday.

1348
01:13:41,382 --> 01:13:44,010
Monday...
you saw my book.

1349
01:13:44,085 --> 01:13:46,679
Jim, Jim... I can't.

1350
01:13:46,754 --> 01:13:48,619
You saw my book.
I can't.

1351
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:50,749
We have to before Monday
to get our money back.

1352
01:13:50,825 --> 01:13:52,850
Three business days,
they mean.

1353
01:13:52,927 --> 01:13:55,361
- Three business days.
- Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

1354
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:58,695
- I don't understand.
- That's what they are, three business...

1355
01:13:58,766 --> 01:14:00,859
if we wait till Monday,
my time limit runs out.

1356
01:14:00,935 --> 01:14:03,028
- You don't count Saturday.
- I'm not.

1357
01:14:03,104 --> 01:14:05,766
I'm saying you don't include
Saturday in the three days.

1358
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:09,207
- It's not a business day.
- I am not counting it.

1359
01:14:09,277 --> 01:14:13,941
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday...
so it would have elapsed.

1360
01:14:14,015 --> 01:14:15,949
What would have elapsed?

1361
01:14:16,017 --> 01:14:17,780
If we wait till Monday
it would have elapsed!

1362
01:14:17,852 --> 01:14:20,116
- When did you write the check?
- Yesterday.

1363
01:14:20,188 --> 01:14:21,883
- What was yesterday?
- Tuesday.

1364
01:14:21,956 --> 01:14:25,050
- And when was that check cashed?
- I don't know.

1365
01:14:25,126 --> 01:14:27,492
What was the earliest
it could have been cashed?

1366
01:14:27,562 --> 01:14:30,929
- I don't know.
- Today.

1367
01:14:30,998 --> 01:14:34,195
Today. Which, in any case,
it was not...

1368
01:14:34,268 --> 01:14:37,396
there was something on the agreement
I wanted to go over with you.

1369
01:14:37,472 --> 01:14:39,463
It wasn't cashed?

1370
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:41,735
I just phoned downtown...
it's on their desk.

1371
01:14:41,809 --> 01:14:43,970
- Rick.
- One moment.

1372
01:14:44,045 --> 01:14:46,843
One point, in fact, of which
I spoke to you of which,

1373
01:14:46,914 --> 01:14:48,939
I can't talk to you
about it here.

1374
01:14:49,016 --> 01:14:51,314
- Levene!
- Listen to me.

1375
01:14:51,386 --> 01:14:55,379
The statute is for your protection.
I have no complaint with that.

1376
01:14:55,456 --> 01:14:57,686
In fact, I was a member
of the board when we drafted it.

1377
01:14:57,759 --> 01:14:59,727
So quite the opposite.
It says,

1378
01:14:59,794 --> 01:15:02,524
"You can change your mind
three 'working days'

1379
01:15:02,597 --> 01:15:04,462
from the time
the deal was closed."

1380
01:15:04,532 --> 01:15:06,500
- Levene!
- Wait a second!

1381
01:15:06,567 --> 01:15:08,728
Which is not until
the check is cashed!

1382
01:15:08,803 --> 01:15:12,239
I'm through with this "meshugaas."
Nobody should talk to a man that way.

1383
01:15:12,306 --> 01:15:14,604
- How are you talking to me that way?
- Levene!

1384
01:15:14,675 --> 01:15:17,610
- How can you talk to me that way?
- I'm gonna flag a cab.

1385
01:15:17,678 --> 01:15:20,579
- I didn't rob...
- Shelly, get in the office.

1386
01:15:20,648 --> 01:15:23,776
"Where were you last?"
Is anybody listening to me?

1387
01:15:23,851 --> 01:15:27,617
- Where's Moss?
- Is this Levene?

1388
01:15:27,688 --> 01:15:30,589
Perhaps I could assist you.
Excuse us, will you?

1389
01:15:30,658 --> 01:15:34,150
I work here! I didn't come in here
to be mistreated!

1390
01:15:34,228 --> 01:15:36,958
- Go to lunch, will you?
- That's why I came in to work today.

1391
01:15:37,031 --> 01:15:38,760
The leads come in,
I'll let you know.

1392
01:15:38,833 --> 01:15:40,767
- That's why I came in!
- Just go to lunch.

1393
01:15:40,835 --> 01:15:43,065
- I don't wanna go to lunch!
- Go to lunch, George.

1394
01:15:43,137 --> 01:15:45,071
Where does he get off
talking that way to a working man?

1395
01:15:45,139 --> 01:15:47,300
Take it outside. We have people
trying to do business.

1396
01:15:47,375 --> 01:15:49,502
That's what I came in here for.
That's what I'm trying to do!

1397
01:15:49,577 --> 01:15:52,102
- I meet Gestapo tactics.
- Excuse me.

1398
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:54,205
I meet Gestapo tactics!

1399
01:15:54,282 --> 01:15:56,580
I meet Gestapo tactics.
That's not right.

1400
01:15:56,651 --> 01:16:02,419
No man has the right...
no man has the right...

1401
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:06,586
"Call an attorney"...
that means you're under...

1402
01:16:06,661 --> 01:16:08,595
he says, "Cooperate
or we'll take you downtown."

1403
01:16:08,663 --> 01:16:10,631
That's not...
as long as I've...

1404
01:16:10,698 --> 01:16:12,165
Will you get out of here?

1405
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,964
Will you get out of here?
Will you?

1406
01:16:15,036 --> 01:16:18,005
I'm trying to run an office here.
Now, will you go to lunch?

1407
01:16:18,072 --> 01:16:22,270
Go to lunch.
Will you go to lunch?

1408
01:16:35,823 --> 01:16:38,018
- Excuse me.
- Where did Moss...?

1409
01:16:38,092 --> 01:16:41,220
- Excuse me, please?
- Did he go to the restaurant?

1410
01:16:41,295 --> 01:16:43,593
Will you
excuse me, please?

1411
01:16:47,235 --> 01:16:49,760
I'm sorry, l...

1412
01:16:51,172 --> 01:16:54,539
I apologize to you. It's...

1413
01:16:54,609 --> 01:16:57,169
It's not me,
it's my wife.

1414
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:01,010
What is it?

1415
01:17:01,082 --> 01:17:03,107
- I told you.
- Tell me again.

1416
01:17:03,184 --> 01:17:06,085
- What's going on here?
- Tell me again... your wife?

1417
01:17:06,153 --> 01:17:08,314
- I told you.
- Tell me again.

1418
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:10,949
She wants her money back.

1419
01:17:11,025 --> 01:17:12,788
We're gonna speak to her.

1420
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:15,385
No, she told me,
"Right now."

1421
01:17:15,463 --> 01:17:17,829
- We're gonna speak to her, Jim.
- She won't listen.

1422
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:19,730
- She...
- Roma!

1423
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:23,327
She said if don't get my money back,
to call the state's attorney.

1424
01:17:23,404 --> 01:17:25,201
No. No.
This is something she said.

1425
01:17:25,273 --> 01:17:27,673
- We don't have to do that.
- She told me I have to.

1426
01:17:27,742 --> 01:17:29,903
- No, Jim.
- I do.

1427
01:17:29,977 --> 01:17:31,672
Listen, I do...
if I don't get my money back...

1428
01:17:31,746 --> 01:17:33,646
Roma,
I'm talking to you.

1429
01:17:33,714 --> 01:17:37,548
Listen... will someone
get this guy off my back, please?

1430
01:17:37,618 --> 01:17:40,849
- You have a problem?
- Yes, I have a problem!

1431
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:42,446
Yes, I do, my friend.
It is not me

1432
01:17:42,523 --> 01:17:45,390
that ripped the joint off.
I'm doing business.

1433
01:17:45,459 --> 01:17:49,088
I will be with you
in a while, got it?

1434
01:17:49,163 --> 01:17:52,530
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

1435
01:17:54,835 --> 01:17:56,826
This is me!

1436
01:17:56,904 --> 01:18:00,670
Jim, this is
Ricky, Jim.

1437
01:18:02,043 --> 01:18:06,002
Jim, anything you want,
you want it, you got it.

1438
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,548
Understand?
This is me.

1439
01:18:08,616 --> 01:18:11,084
Something upset you.

1440
01:18:11,152 --> 01:18:13,450
Yes.
Sit down now.

1441
01:18:13,521 --> 01:18:17,423
Sit down.
You tell me what it is,

1442
01:18:17,491 --> 01:18:20,858
am I gonna
help you fix it?

1443
01:18:20,928 --> 01:18:22,987
You're goddamned
right I am.

1444
01:18:23,064 --> 01:18:25,589
Sit down.

1445
01:18:25,666 --> 01:18:28,226
I'll tell you something,

1446
01:18:28,302 --> 01:18:33,103
sometimes we need
someone from outside.

1447
01:18:36,077 --> 01:18:38,671
Sit. Talk to me,
come on.

1448
01:18:42,883 --> 01:18:45,545
I can't negotiate.

1449
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,880
What does that mean?

1450
01:18:50,191 --> 01:18:52,659
What?

1451
01:18:54,528 --> 01:18:56,587
What?
Say the words.

1452
01:18:56,664 --> 01:18:59,462
I don't have the power.

1453
01:18:59,533 --> 01:19:01,626
Okay, I said it.

1454
01:19:01,702 --> 01:19:05,103
- What power?
- To negotiate.

1455
01:19:05,172 --> 01:19:07,140
To negotiate what?

1456
01:19:09,210 --> 01:19:11,371
To negotiate what?

1457
01:19:11,445 --> 01:19:13,276
This.

1458
01:19:13,347 --> 01:19:15,440
- What this?
- The deal.

1459
01:19:15,516 --> 01:19:17,416
The deal?

1460
01:19:17,485 --> 01:19:19,476
Forget the deal, Jim.

1461
01:19:19,553 --> 01:19:22,522
You got something on your mind,
what is it?

1462
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:25,252
What?

1463
01:19:27,561 --> 01:19:29,893
I can't talk to you.

1464
01:19:29,964 --> 01:19:32,432
You met my wife.

1465
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:35,435
- What?
- Aw...

1466
01:19:37,638 --> 01:19:39,765
I met your wife,
what?

1467
01:19:43,911 --> 01:19:46,209
What, Jim?

1468
01:19:48,215 --> 01:19:50,649
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, let's go.

1469
01:19:50,718 --> 01:19:51,946
Get a drink,
come on.

1470
01:19:52,019 --> 01:19:54,214
No, no, she told me
not to talk to you.

1471
01:19:54,288 --> 01:19:56,153
Come on, we're gonna
go around the corner.

1472
01:19:56,223 --> 01:19:57,781
We'll have a drink.
Who's gonna know?

1473
01:19:57,858 --> 01:19:59,883
She told me to get
the check back, otherwise...

1474
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:01,985
Forget the deal, Jimmy.
Forget the deal.

1475
01:20:02,063 --> 01:20:05,555
The deal is dead.
You know me, the deal's dead.

1476
01:20:05,633 --> 01:20:07,999
Am I talking
about the deal?

1477
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:10,435
That's over.

1478
01:20:10,504 --> 01:20:13,166
Please...
let's talk about you.

1479
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:22,510
I'm gonna tell you
something.

1480
01:20:22,583 --> 01:20:24,915
Your life is your own.

1481
01:20:26,754 --> 01:20:28,949
You have a contract
with your wife,

1482
01:20:29,023 --> 01:20:32,049
you have certain things
you do jointly,

1483
01:20:32,126 --> 01:20:35,289
you have a bond there.
And there are other things,

1484
01:20:35,362 --> 01:20:41,358
and those things are yours.
You needn't feel ashamed.

1485
01:20:41,435 --> 01:20:44,029
You needn't feel
that you're being untrue

1486
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:48,303
or that she would
abandon you if she knew.

1487
01:20:48,375 --> 01:20:51,538
This is your life.

1488
01:20:56,817 --> 01:20:58,648
Yes?

1489
01:21:01,255 --> 01:21:04,816
Now, I want to talk to you
because you're obviously upset,

1490
01:21:04,892 --> 01:21:07,918
and that concerns me.

1491
01:21:07,995 --> 01:21:10,395
Let's go,
come on, right now.

1492
01:21:10,464 --> 01:21:12,193
Let's go, come on.

1493
01:21:12,266 --> 01:21:14,530
Roma.

1494
01:21:14,602 --> 01:21:17,332
- What?
- The check, it's...

1495
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:20,968
What did I tell you?

1496
01:21:21,041 --> 01:21:22,906
No, what did I tell you
about the three days?

1497
01:21:22,977 --> 01:21:24,911
Roma, would you?
I'd like to get some lunch.

1498
01:21:25,312 --> 01:21:29,408
I am talking with Mr. Lingk,
if you please.

1499
01:21:29,483 --> 01:21:33,442
I will be with you in a while.
Just check with Mr. Williamson.

1500
01:21:33,521 --> 01:21:37,287
- People downtown said...
- Call them again. Mr. Williamson!

1501
01:21:37,358 --> 01:21:39,451
Yes?

1502
01:21:39,527 --> 01:21:41,552
Mr. Lingk and I
are going to go to the...

1503
01:21:41,629 --> 01:21:44,393
Oh, yes, please.
The police can be...

1504
01:21:44,465 --> 01:21:47,059
- What are the police doing here?
- It's nothing.

1505
01:21:47,134 --> 01:21:50,934
- What are the police doing here?
- We had a slight burglary last night.

1506
01:21:51,005 --> 01:21:53,166
It's nothing,
I was just assuring Mr. Lingk.

1507
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:55,606
Mr. Lingk? James Lingk?
Your contract went out.

1508
01:21:55,676 --> 01:21:57,576
- Nothing to worry about.
- John, John...

1509
01:21:57,645 --> 01:21:59,442
- Your contract went out to the bank.
- You cashed my check?

1510
01:21:59,513 --> 01:22:01,447
- Mr. Williamson...
- The check was cashed.

1511
01:22:01,515 --> 01:22:04,143
The contract was filed
and deposited in the bank,

1512
01:22:04,218 --> 01:22:06,618
and we're completely insured
in any case, as you know.

1513
01:22:06,687 --> 01:22:10,783
- You cashed the check?
- Not to my knowledge, no.

1514
01:22:10,858 --> 01:22:13,656
- Though I'm sure we can...
- Not to my knowledge.

1515
01:22:13,727 --> 01:22:17,026
Christ! L...
Oh, Christ.

1516
01:22:17,097 --> 01:22:19,565
Don't follow me,
just don't follow me, okay?

1517
01:22:22,136 --> 01:22:24,764
I've let you down.
I know I've let you down.

1518
01:22:24,839 --> 01:22:28,104
I'm sorry, forgive me. L-l...

1519
01:22:29,443 --> 01:22:32,207
I don't...
I don't know anymore.

1520
01:22:33,747 --> 01:22:38,343
I... forgive me.

1521
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:54,963
You stupid fucking cunt.

1522
01:22:56,337 --> 01:22:58,464
You, Williamson,
I'm talking to you, shithead.

1523
01:22:58,539 --> 01:23:01,167
You just cost me
$6,000.

1524
01:23:01,242 --> 01:23:07,806
$6,000, and one Cadillac.
That's right.

1525
01:23:07,882 --> 01:23:10,248
What are you gonna
do about it?

1526
01:23:10,317 --> 01:23:14,845
What are you
gonna do about it, asshole?

1527
01:23:14,922 --> 01:23:16,856
You're fucking shit.

1528
01:23:16,924 --> 01:23:19,324
Where did you
learn your trade,

1529
01:23:19,393 --> 01:23:22,226
you stupid fucking cunt,
you idiot?

1530
01:23:22,296 --> 01:23:24,730
Who ever told you
that you could work with men?

1531
01:23:24,798 --> 01:23:26,197
Could I...?

1532
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:28,735
Oh, I'm gonna have
your job, shithead.

1533
01:23:28,802 --> 01:23:31,532
I'm going downtown.
I'm gonna talk to Mitch and Murray.

1534
01:23:31,605 --> 01:23:35,632
I'm going to Lemkin!
I don't care whose nephew you are,

1535
01:23:35,709 --> 01:23:38,735
who you know,
whose dick you're sucking on,

1536
01:23:38,812 --> 01:23:41,144
you're going out.
I swear to you...

1537
01:23:41,215 --> 01:23:43,843
Hey, fella,
let's get this done.

1538
01:23:45,853 --> 01:23:49,345
Anyone in this office
lives on his wits...

1539
01:23:49,423 --> 01:23:52,153
I'm gonna be with you
in a second.

1540
01:23:54,862 --> 01:23:58,525
What you're hired for
is to help us.

1541
01:23:58,599 --> 01:24:01,397
Does that seem
clear to you?

1542
01:24:01,468 --> 01:24:06,337
To help us!
Not to fuck us up!

1543
01:24:06,407 --> 01:24:09,570
To help men who are
going out there

1544
01:24:09,643 --> 01:24:13,135
to try to earn a living,
you fairy.

1545
01:24:13,213 --> 01:24:14,942
You company man.

1546
01:24:15,015 --> 01:24:18,007
I'll tell you something else,
I hope you ripped the joint off.

1547
01:24:18,085 --> 01:24:21,612
I can tell our friend here something,
might help him to catch you.

1548
01:24:26,593 --> 01:24:28,959
You wanna learn
the first rule

1549
01:24:29,029 --> 01:24:32,021
you'd know if you ever
spent a day in your life?

1550
01:24:32,099 --> 01:24:37,469
You never open your mouth
till you know what the shot is.

1551
01:24:39,306 --> 01:24:42,036
You fucking child.

1552
01:24:54,288 --> 01:24:57,382
You are a shithead,
Williamson.

1553
01:24:59,259 --> 01:25:02,387
Can't think on your feet,
you ought to keep your mouth closed.

1554
01:25:02,463 --> 01:25:05,626
Can you hear me?
I'm talking to you.

1555
01:25:05,699 --> 01:25:07,530
Yes, I hear you.

1556
01:25:07,601 --> 01:25:10,729
Ricky's right. Can't learn in an office,
gotta learn it in the street.

1557
01:25:10,804 --> 01:25:12,999
And you sure can't buy it,
you gotta live it.

1558
01:25:13,073 --> 01:25:15,064
- Mmmm.
- "Mmmm," yeah!

1559
01:25:15,142 --> 01:25:18,407
Precisely.
Because your partner depends...

1560
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:20,413
I'm talking to you,
trying to tell you something!

1561
01:25:20,481 --> 01:25:21,573
- You are?
- Yeah, I am.

1562
01:25:21,648 --> 01:25:24,082
- What are you trying to tell me?
- What Roma was trying to tell you.

1563
01:25:24,151 --> 01:25:27,484
What I told you a long time ago.
You don't belong in this business.

1564
01:25:27,554 --> 01:25:29,818
You might listen to me.
One day you could say,

1565
01:25:29,890 --> 01:25:31,585
"Hey, maybe the guy..."
oh, fuck it.

1566
01:25:31,658 --> 01:25:34,650
Listen to me now.
Your partner depends on you.

1567
01:25:34,728 --> 01:25:37,288
The man who is your partner,
depends on you.

1568
01:25:37,364 --> 01:25:40,333
You go with him
and for him or you're shit!

1569
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:42,631
You are shit...
you can't exist alone.

1570
01:25:42,703 --> 01:25:44,534
- Excuse me.
- "Excuse you," nothing!

1571
01:25:44,605 --> 01:25:47,733
You be as cold as you want.
You just fucked a good man

1572
01:25:47,808 --> 01:25:49,867
out of $6,000
and his goddamned bonus

1573
01:25:49,943 --> 01:25:52,002
because you didn't
know the shot.

1574
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:54,377
You can do that and you're not
man enough to say it gets you?

1575
01:25:54,448 --> 01:25:57,417
I don't know what...
if you can't take something from that,

1576
01:25:57,484 --> 01:26:00,317
then you're... scum!
You're fucking white bread.

1577
01:26:00,387 --> 01:26:03,413
A child would know it,
he's right.

1578
01:26:03,490 --> 01:26:06,687
If you're gonna make something up,
be sure that it helps.

1579
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:09,729
Hmm?
Or keep your mouth shut.

1580
01:26:09,797 --> 01:26:12,561
I'm done with you.

1581
01:26:25,145 --> 01:26:26,737
How do you know
I made it up?

1582
01:26:26,814 --> 01:26:29,146
What?

1583
01:26:29,216 --> 01:26:32,151
How do you know
I made it up?

1584
01:26:32,219 --> 01:26:34,710
What are you
talking about, huh?

1585
01:26:37,391 --> 01:26:40,451
You said, "Don't make something up
unless it's sure to help."

1586
01:26:42,496 --> 01:26:47,126
- How did you know I made it up?
- What are you talking about?

1587
01:26:54,408 --> 01:26:57,172
I told the customer his contract
had gone to the bank.

1588
01:26:57,244 --> 01:26:59,439
Yeah. Well, hadn't it?

1589
01:27:03,183 --> 01:27:05,117
No, it hadn't.

1590
01:27:07,721 --> 01:27:09,382
Don't fuck with me.

1591
01:27:09,456 --> 01:27:11,890
Don't fuck with me!
What are you getting at?

1592
01:27:11,959 --> 01:27:14,723
I'm saying this, Shelly...

1593
01:27:17,231 --> 01:27:19,893
usually I take
the contracts to the bank,

1594
01:27:19,967 --> 01:27:22,231
last night I didn't.

1595
01:27:23,637 --> 01:27:26,765
Last night I stayed home
with my kids.

1596
01:27:28,775 --> 01:27:31,175
How did you know that?

1597
01:27:33,147 --> 01:27:38,016
One night in a year,
I left a contract on my desk.

1598
01:27:38,085 --> 01:27:40,519
No one knew that but you.

1599
01:27:41,788 --> 01:27:43,551
Now, how did you know that?

1600
01:27:43,624 --> 01:27:47,219
You want to talk to me or you
want to talk to someone else?

1601
01:27:47,294 --> 01:27:48,761
Because this is my job!

1602
01:27:48,829 --> 01:27:52,697
This is my job on the line
and you are gonna talk to me!

1603
01:27:52,766 --> 01:27:55,758
Now how did you know
that contract was on my desk?

1604
01:27:55,836 --> 01:27:58,396
You are so full of shit!

1605
01:27:58,472 --> 01:28:00,804
- You robbed the office.
- Oh, sure, I robbed the office.

1606
01:28:00,874 --> 01:28:03,001
Oh sure! You asshole.

1607
01:28:03,076 --> 01:28:04,907
What did you do
with the leads?

1608
01:28:04,978 --> 01:28:07,674
You wanna go in there?
I tell him what I know,

1609
01:28:07,748 --> 01:28:10,410
he's gonna dig up something.
You got an alibi last night?

1610
01:28:10,484 --> 01:28:13,885
You better have one!
What did you do with the leads?

1611
01:28:13,954 --> 01:28:17,117
If you tell me what you did
with the leads, we can talk.

1612
01:28:17,191 --> 01:28:19,523
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

1613
01:28:19,593 --> 01:28:21,959
If you tell me where the leads are,
I won't turn you in.

1614
01:28:22,029 --> 01:28:24,429
If you don't, I'm gonna tell
the cop you stole them.

1615
01:28:24,498 --> 01:28:27,626
Mitch and Murray will see that you
go to jail, believe me, they will!

1616
01:28:27,701 --> 01:28:29,134
Now, where are the leads?

1617
01:28:29,203 --> 01:28:31,262
I'm walking in that door.
You got five seconds

1618
01:28:31,338 --> 01:28:32,965
- or you are going to jail!
- Go ahead.

1619
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,508
I don't care,
you understand?

1620
01:28:36,743 --> 01:28:39,268
Where are the leads?

1621
01:28:40,681 --> 01:28:42,774
All right.

1622
01:28:44,718 --> 01:28:46,686
I sold them.

1623
01:28:55,662 --> 01:28:58,153
To Jerry Graff.

1624
01:28:58,232 --> 01:29:00,530
How much did you
get for them?

1625
01:29:00,601 --> 01:29:02,466
How much did
you get for them?

1626
01:29:02,536 --> 01:29:04,868
Five.
Five grand.

1627
01:29:04,938 --> 01:29:07,805
- I got half.
- Who got the other half?

1628
01:29:07,874 --> 01:29:09,865
Do I have to tell you?

1629
01:29:09,943 --> 01:29:12,468
Moss.

1630
01:29:16,083 --> 01:29:18,142
Well, that was easy,
wasn't it?

1631
01:29:18,218 --> 01:29:20,743
- His idea.
- Was it?

1632
01:29:20,821 --> 01:29:23,051
I think he got
more than five, actually.

1633
01:29:23,123 --> 01:29:26,422
- Uh-huh.
- He told me my cut was 2500.

1634
01:29:26,493 --> 01:29:28,723
Mmm.

1635
01:29:30,297 --> 01:29:31,924
Wait a minute.
Okay... hey, hey, John!

1636
01:29:31,999 --> 01:29:35,196
Wait... okay, John!
Hey, Johnny.

1637
01:29:35,269 --> 01:29:38,796
Listen.
Come here, come here.

1638
01:29:40,974 --> 01:29:42,703
Eh, John?

1639
01:29:42,776 --> 01:29:45,040
Last night...

1640
01:29:45,112 --> 01:29:47,774
I gotta tell you,
I'm ready to "do the Dutch."

1641
01:29:47,848 --> 01:29:50,783
I'm done. Moss gets me,
"Do this, we'll get well."

1642
01:29:50,851 --> 01:29:54,150
Why not? Big fucking deal.
I'm halfway hoping to get caught.

1643
01:29:54,221 --> 01:29:58,351
Hey... put me out of my misery.
It taught me something, John.

1644
01:29:58,425 --> 01:30:00,893
What it taught me...
you gotta get out there!

1645
01:30:00,961 --> 01:30:04,294
I'm not cut out to be a thief,
I'm cut out to be a salesman.

1646
01:30:04,498 --> 01:30:07,194
And I am back.
I got my balls back.

1647
01:30:07,267 --> 01:30:11,226
Now... you got a slight
advantage on me.

1648
01:30:11,305 --> 01:30:13,899
But whatever it takes, John,

1649
01:30:13,974 --> 01:30:16,499
to make things right,
we're gonna make it right.

1650
01:30:16,576 --> 01:30:19,170
We are going
to make it right.

1651
01:30:22,582 --> 01:30:24,379
I want to tell you
something, Shelly.

1652
01:30:24,451 --> 01:30:28,114
- Eh?
- You have a big mouth.

1653
01:30:28,188 --> 01:30:30,713
What?

1654
01:30:30,791 --> 01:30:32,486
You've got a big mouth!

1655
01:30:32,559 --> 01:30:35,289
And now I'm gonna show you
an even bigger one.

1656
01:30:35,362 --> 01:30:37,227
Where are you going?

1657
01:30:37,297 --> 01:30:40,027
You can't do that!
You don't want to do that.

1658
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:42,364
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1659
01:30:44,104 --> 01:30:47,596
It's $2,500. Go ahead
and take it, take it all.

1660
01:30:47,674 --> 01:30:50,040
No, I don't think so.
I don't think I want your money.

1661
01:30:50,110 --> 01:30:53,011
I think you fucked up my office,
and I think you're going away.

1662
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:57,016
Are you nuts?
I'm gonna close for you! Take...

1663
01:30:57,084 --> 01:31:00,520
I'm gonna make this office and be
number one on that board again.

1664
01:31:00,587 --> 01:31:02,885
Wait, John.

1665
01:31:02,956 --> 01:31:06,448
John... okay.

1666
01:31:09,262 --> 01:31:13,665
This is what
we're gonna do... 20% .

1667
01:31:13,734 --> 01:31:16,931
I'm gonna give you 20%% %
of all my sales.

1668
01:31:17,003 --> 01:31:19,938
20%% %, as long as I'm
with this firm.

1669
01:31:20,006 --> 01:31:22,031
50.

1670
01:31:22,109 --> 01:31:26,546
- 50%% % of all my sales.
- What sales?

1671
01:31:26,613 --> 01:31:28,774
What sales? My God,
I just closed 82 grand.

1672
01:31:28,849 --> 01:31:31,977
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I'm back! This is just the beginning!

1673
01:31:32,052 --> 01:31:34,520
Just the beginning?
Where have you been, Shelly?

1674
01:31:34,588 --> 01:31:37,557
Bruce and Harriett Nyborg...
do you want to see the memos?

1675
01:31:37,624 --> 01:31:41,219
They're nuts.
They used to call in every week...

1676
01:31:41,294 --> 01:31:43,819
when I was with Webb...
we were selling Arizona.

1677
01:31:43,897 --> 01:31:45,956
They're nuts.

1678
01:31:46,032 --> 01:31:51,402
Did you see how they were living?
How can you delude yourself?

1679
01:31:51,471 --> 01:31:53,439
- I've got their check.
- Forget it. Frame it.

1680
01:31:53,507 --> 01:31:55,702
- It's worthless.
- The check is no good?

1681
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:58,142
You want to stick around?
I'll pull the memo. I'm busy.

1682
01:31:58,211 --> 01:32:00,111
The check is no good?
They're nuts?

1683
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:02,011
You want to call the bank?
I called them.

1684
01:32:02,082 --> 01:32:05,745
I called them four months ago
when we first got the lead.

1685
01:32:05,819 --> 01:32:08,583
The people are insane.

1686
01:32:10,056 --> 01:32:13,492
They just like talking
to salesmen.

1687
01:32:18,498 --> 01:32:22,730
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

1688
01:32:25,338 --> 01:32:29,274
- Why?
- Because I don't like you.

1689
01:32:36,049 --> 01:32:38,040
My daughter.

1690
01:32:38,118 --> 01:32:40,313
Fuck you.

1691
01:32:55,469 --> 01:32:57,869
Asshole.

1692
01:32:57,938 --> 01:33:01,101
Guy couldn't find his fucking couch
in the living room.

1693
01:33:03,276 --> 01:33:05,676
What a day.

1694
01:33:05,745 --> 01:33:07,736
Whoo...

1695
01:33:07,814 --> 01:33:10,282
I haven't even had
a cup of coffee.

1696
01:33:13,820 --> 01:33:17,483
Jag-off John opens his mouth,
blows my Cadillac.

1697
01:33:19,993 --> 01:33:23,588
I swear,
it's not a world of men.

1698
01:33:26,099 --> 01:33:28,795
It is not
a world of men, "Machine."

1699
01:33:28,869 --> 01:33:31,667
- Huh?
- It's a world of clock-watchers...

1700
01:33:31,738 --> 01:33:34,366
bureaucrats...

1701
01:33:34,441 --> 01:33:37,171
officeholders, what it is.

1702
01:33:38,245 --> 01:33:40,543
It's a fucked-up world.

1703
01:33:42,883 --> 01:33:44,851
No adventure to it.

1704
01:33:44,918 --> 01:33:49,184
Dying breed.
Yes, it is.

1705
01:33:50,891 --> 01:33:54,622
We're the members of a dying breed.
That's... that's...

1706
01:33:54,694 --> 01:33:58,460
that's why we got
to stick together. Shel?

1707
01:33:58,532 --> 01:34:00,898
- Huh?
- I want to talk to you.

1708
01:34:00,967 --> 01:34:03,265
I've wanted to talk to you
for some time...

1709
01:34:03,336 --> 01:34:07,238
for a long time, actually.
I said, "The Machine"...

1710
01:34:07,307 --> 01:34:10,708
there's a man
I would work with.

1711
01:34:10,777 --> 01:34:14,508
There's..." you know,
I never said a word.

1712
01:34:14,581 --> 01:34:17,516
I don't know why I didn't.
I should've, I don't know why.

1713
01:34:17,584 --> 01:34:21,418
And that shit you were slinging
on my guy today...

1714
01:34:21,488 --> 01:34:25,652
that was so good.
That... it...

1715
01:34:25,725 --> 01:34:28,523
excuse me for saying this,
it's not even my place to say it.

1716
01:34:28,595 --> 01:34:31,155
That was admirable.

1717
01:34:31,231 --> 01:34:33,893
It was the old stuff.

1718
01:34:33,967 --> 01:34:37,528
Hey, I've been
on a hot streak.

1719
01:34:37,604 --> 01:34:41,335
So what?
Things I can learn from you.

1720
01:34:43,410 --> 01:34:45,605
- You eat today?
- Me?

1721
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:47,169
Yeah.

1722
01:34:47,247 --> 01:34:50,614
Want to swing around the Chinks'...
watch me eat, we'll talk?

1723
01:34:50,684 --> 01:34:53,016
I think
I'll stay around awhile.

1724
01:34:53,086 --> 01:34:55,054
Hello, Mrs. Schwartz?

1725
01:34:55,121 --> 01:34:57,214
This is Richard Roma
with Premiere Properties.

1726
01:34:57,290 --> 01:35:00,225
You or your accountant requested
information on a land investment

1727
01:35:00,293 --> 01:35:02,887
which would offer you
depreciation and the chance

1728
01:35:02,963 --> 01:35:05,193
of a substantial return
on a small investment.

1729
01:35:05,265 --> 01:35:07,699
I'm in from Florida
just for one day...

1730
01:35:07,767 --> 01:35:11,601
- Mr. Levene?
...so I only have that one lot left.

1731
01:35:11,671 --> 01:35:13,502
Would you come in here,
please?

1732
01:35:13,573 --> 01:35:15,939
I don't have too much time
and I'm on the midnight plane back,

1733
01:35:16,009 --> 01:35:18,443
so if you or your husband
are truly interested...

1734
01:35:18,511 --> 01:35:20,979
because I can't hold
this parcel past...

1735
01:35:21,047 --> 01:35:23,538
Yes?

1736
01:35:23,617 --> 01:35:26,586
Well, what would be better
for you... say, 6:00 or 8:00?

1737
01:35:27,988 --> 01:35:32,118
Go ask him. Shel... we're gonna talk?
I'm going to the Chinks'.

1738
01:35:32,192 --> 01:35:34,126
When you're done, come down.
We're gonna smoke a cigarette.

1739
01:35:34,194 --> 01:35:36,321
- I...
- Get in the room.

1740
01:35:36,396 --> 01:35:40,298
Hey. Hey, easy, pal.
That's "The Machine."

1741
01:35:40,367 --> 01:35:43,393
This is Shelly
"The Machine" Levene.

1742
01:35:43,470 --> 01:35:45,836
- Get in the goddamn room.
- Rick, I...

1743
01:35:45,905 --> 01:35:48,066
- I'll meet you at the restaurant.
- Ricky...

1744
01:35:48,141 --> 01:35:50,006
- Ricky can't help you.
- All I want is...

1745
01:35:50,076 --> 01:35:52,135
What do you want?
You want to what?

1746
01:35:52,212 --> 01:35:56,114
- Rick? Rick?
- Hello? Excellent.

1747
01:35:57,550 --> 01:36:02,385
8:00 p.m.
6947 Euclid.

1748
01:36:02,455 --> 01:36:05,185
Not at all...
thank you very much.

1749
01:36:15,869 --> 01:36:19,100
They find the guy
that broke in the office?

1750
01:36:19,172 --> 01:36:22,335
No. I don't know.

1751
01:36:27,180 --> 01:36:29,273
Did the leads
come in yet?

1752
01:36:29,349 --> 01:36:31,817
No.

1753
01:36:39,693 --> 01:36:41,991
Oh God,
I hate this job.

1754
01:36:42,062 --> 01:36:44,155
Anybody wants me,
I'm at the restaurant.

1755
01:36:49,736 --> 01:36:52,534
Hello, Mrs. Delgari?

1756
01:36:52,605 --> 01:36:55,836
Yes... you requested some information
about Rio Rancho Properties?

1757
01:36:56,076 --> 01:37:00,775
^ Blue skies smiling at me ^

1758
01:37:00,847 --> 01:37:06,149

^ I never saw the sun
shining so bright ^

1764
01:37:21,501 --> 01:37:24,265
^ Never saw things
going so right ^

1765
01:37:24,337 --> 01:37:27,238
^ Noticing the days
hurrying by ^

1766
01:37:27,307 --> 01:37:30,765
^ When you're in love,
my, how they fly ^

1767
01:37:30,844 --> 01:37:35,178
^ Blue days,
all of them gone ^

1768
01:37:35,248 --> 01:37:40,276

1769
