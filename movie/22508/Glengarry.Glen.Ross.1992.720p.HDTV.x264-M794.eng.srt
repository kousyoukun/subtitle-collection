1
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,111
2306, please.

2
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,951
Hello, honey.
How you doing?

3
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:42,913
Good.
What did he say?

4
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:47,543
Uh-huh. Is he still there?
How long ago did he leave?

5
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:51,547
Uh-huh. I'm stopping here,
then I got a little meeting,

6
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,258
and then I'll...
I would if I could.

7
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,469
As soon as I can.
Let me get off and I...

8
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:01,765
let me get off and I prom...
I promise you it'll be okay.

9
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:07,646
A bunch of bullshit.
Waste a good man's time.

10
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,906
Hi, could I speak
to Dr. Lowenstein, please?

11
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,617
It's rather important.
Could you get him for me?

12
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,370
Bunch of bullshit trying to make
a living on these deadbeat leads.

13
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,914
I swear to God, Shel,
I'm on a sit today...

14
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:29,168
Hello, Mrs. Swoboda,
this is Dave Moss.

15
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,253
Yeah, we spoke yesterday.

16
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:35,090
Now on the Rio Rancho Estates,
we've had a situation just come up.

17
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,759
The president of our company
is in town just one day,

18
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,137
- and he has certain parcels...
- Doctor...

19
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,223
well, could you get...
what do you mean?

20
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:46,018
He's not there?
I have to speak to him.

21
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:50,063
Yes, it is fairly urgent.
Mr. Levene.

22
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:54,359
No, I can't be reached.
I'll get back to him.

23
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,653
He has certain parcels...
certain choice parcels

24
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,198
which he's given me
a hold on for the next 48 hours.

25
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:02,242
What would be the best time to get
you and your husband together?

26
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:07,289
Say, tonight, at 10:00,
or tomorrow at 8:00?

27
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,833
Okay.

28
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,503
Okay, what would be
the best time to do that?

29
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,883
Look, you sent in the...
no, no, listen to me now...

30
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,677
I've got 48 hours
to make you a lot of money.

31
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:26,391
Well, when will he be home?
Fine, I'll call you back in 10 minutes.

32
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,646
They don't give you the leads,
they don't give you the support,

33
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,564
- they don't give you dick.
- Yeah.

34
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,608
Then they're yanking us in
on some sales conference.

35
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,778
When's the last time anybody
learned a goddamn thing?

36
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,239
All it does is some jerk
shoots his mouth off.

37
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,327
I swear to God, Shel, I got half a mind
to go across the street.

38
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,913
I got half a mind to go
with you if they'd take me.

39
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:52,125
You never know... I was talking
to Jerry Graff last week.

40
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,380
I got to call
these deadbeats back.

41
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,675
I can't make a goddamn
dollar with these leads,

42
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,593
and you're killing my ass
on the street.

43
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,971
- I'm sorry you aren't happy here.
- That's cute,

44
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,557
but you're running this office
like a bunch of bullshit.

45
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,767
You're on an override...
you make money, we make money.

46
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,854
- I'd like you to make more money.
- Then don't go waste my time.

47
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,606
- A sales conference?
- The strategy comes from downtown.

48
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,942
Oh, the strategy?
The strategy?

49
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,111
- Well, I think I'll pass.
- I wouldn't.

50
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:22,030
- Why is that?
- When you come, then you'll see.

51
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:25,158
- Shelly.
- John.

52
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,286
Are you ready
to do or die tonight?

53
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,288
Oh yeah,
always ready, John.

54
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,665
Always ready, John.
Now, one thing...

55
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,709
we were talking about the leads.
We got some new ones?

56
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,044
That's what we're going
to talk about at the meeting.

57
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,547
We are? Because I'm running
into a bit of a snag.

58
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,382
Yes, I've seen
your sales figures.

59
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,509
That's the leads.
You give me a better lead...

60
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,636
That's what we're going
to be talking about.

61
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,513
I'm in a bind...
personal problems.

62
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,390
- I could use a leg up.
- After the meeting.

63
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:51,643
- I hear the new Glengarry leads...
- After the meeting, Shel.

64
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,645
- Hey, Ricky.
- Hello, John.

65
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,273
- Wet out there tonight.
- Huh?

66
00:05:56,356 --> 00:06:00,819
- Wet out there tonight.
- Uh-huh.

67
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:03,071
- Maybe it'll break the heat.
- Yeah.

68
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,912
Al, give me a quick J&B, huh?
Double.

69
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,747
Cutty, Al.

70
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,336
- They say...
- Huh?

71
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:21,173
they say it was so hot
downtown this afternoon,

72
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:25,761
grown men on the street corner
were going up to cops

73
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,514
begging the cops
to shoot them.

74
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:33,393
They say you should not drink
alcohol when it's so hot.

75
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:37,731
- Who says that?
- Something I read.

76
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:41,151
For they say
it dehydrates you.

77
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:44,071
They say
you should drink water,

78
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:48,283
but I subscribe to the law
of contrary public opinion.

79
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:52,704
If everyone thinks one thing,
then I say bet the other way.

80
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:55,916
Added to which,
you know they're wrong.

81
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,460
That's what I'm saying.

82
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:05,092
- Slow tonight.
- Oh, yeah.

83
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,261
Well, I guess
everybody's staying home.

84
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,638
If my daughter calls,
anybody calls,

85
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:13,267
I'm over at the office.
Thanks.

86
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,677
I had a woman
in White Plains on the hook...

87
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,722
five units, Mountain View...
what happens?

88
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,599
She has to check
with her lawyer.

89
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:56,226
- You let her check with her lawyer?
- What could I do?

90
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,896
- I dunno.
- Shelly.

91
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,064
- Huh?
- Who's the guy?

92
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,066
Couldn't tell you.

93
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,820
I don't like the whole thing,
because all I need is a lead.

94
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,614
- They won't give out...
- Uh-huh.

95
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:11,283
The rich get richer,
that's the law of the land.

96
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,535
Who belongs
to the BM...?

97
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,667
It is 7:30.

98
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,878
So who is that?

99
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,881
And where is
Mr. Roma?

100
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,633
Well, I'm not a leash,
so I don't know, do I?

101
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,763
Let me have
your attention for a moment.

102
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,058
You're talking about what?
You're talking about...

103
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,478
bitching about
that sale you shot,

104
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,772
some son of a bitch
don't want to buy land,

105
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,190
somebody don't want
what you're selling,

106
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:45,192
some broad you're
trying to screw, so forth.

107
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,319
Let's talk
about something important.

108
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,029
- Are they all here?
- All but one.

109
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,072
I'm going anyway.

110
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:53,659
Let's talk
about something important.

111
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:56,119
Put that coffee down.

112
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,710
Coffee's for closers only.

113
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,590
You think
I'm fucking with you?

114
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,846
I am not fucking with you.

115
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,765
I'm here from downtown.

116
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,392
I'm here
from Mitch and Murray.

117
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,603
And I'm here
on a mission of mercy.

118
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:28,986
- Your name's Levene?
- Yeah.

119
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,865
You call yourself a salesman,
you son of a bitch?

120
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,658
I don't got to listen
to this shit.

121
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,995
You certainly don't, 'cause
the good news is, you're fired.

122
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,541
The bad news is you've got...
all of you've got...

123
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,626
just one week
to regain your jobs,

124
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,172
starting with tonight...
starting with tonight's sit.

125
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:54,052
Oh, have I got
your attention now?

126
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:57,973
Good...

127
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,143
'cause we're adding
a little something

128
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,853
to this month's
sales contest.

129
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,023
As you all know, first prize
is a Cadillac Eldorado.

130
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,108
Anybody want to see
second prize?

131
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:11,612
Second prize is
a set of steak knives.

132
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,491
Third prize is you're fired.

133
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,916
Do you get the picture?
Are you laughing now?

134
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:28,420
You got leads. Mitch and Murray
paid good money.

135
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,672
Get their names
to sell them.

136
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,758
You can't close
the leads you're given,

137
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,511
you can't close shit,
you are shit!

138
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:39,097
Hit the bricks, pal, and beat it,
'cause you are going out!

139
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:42,643
- The leads are weak.
- The leads are weak?

140
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:45,437
The fucking leads are weak?
You're weak.

141
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:47,481
I've been
in this business 15 years.

142
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,858
- What's your name?
- Fuck you...

143
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:52,444
that's my name!
You know why, mister?

144
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,655
Because you drove a Hyundai
to get here tonight,

145
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:59,660
I drove an $80,000 BMW.
That's my name.

146
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:06,959
And your name
is "You're wanting."

147
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:10,212
You can't play in the man's game?
You can't close them?

148
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:13,674
Then go home and tell your wife
your troubles.

149
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,427
Because only one thing
counts in this life...

150
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:20,889
get them to sign
on the line which is dotted!

151
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:23,892
You hear me,
you fucking faggots?

152
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,569
"A-B-C."

153
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:36,613
A... Always,
B... Be, C... Closing.

154
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,657
Always Be Closing.

155
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:42,369
"Always Be Closing."

156
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,122
"A-I-D-A."

157
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:47,875
"Attention, Interest,
Decision, Action."

158
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,419
Attention...
Do I have your attention?

159
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,629
Interest...
Are you interested?

160
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:54,965
I know you are,
because it's fuck or walk.

161
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,009
You close
or you hit the bricks.

162
00:11:57,092 --> 00:12:01,305
Decision... Have you made
your decision for Christ?

163
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:06,059
And Action.
"A-I-D-A."

164
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,437
Get out there...
you got the prospects coming in.

165
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,647
You think they came in
to get out of the rain?

166
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,150
A guy don't walk on the lot
lest he wants to buy.

167
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:16,486
They're sitting out there
waiting to give you their money.

168
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,614
Are you gonna take it?

169
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:21,825
Are you man enough
to take it?

170
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,250
Crap.

171
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:32,211
What's the problem, pal?
You... Moss.

172
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:34,755
You're such a hero,
you're so rich,

173
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:38,091
how come you're here wasting
your time with a bunch of bums?

174
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:42,721
You see this watch?

175
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,144
- You see this watch?
- Yeah.

176
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:52,397
That watch costs
more than your car.

177
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:56,527
I made $70,000 last year.
How much you make?

178
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:03,992
You see, pal... that's who I am,
and you're nothing.

179
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:07,955
Nice guy?
I don't give a shit.

180
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:12,000
Good father? Fuck you...
go home and play with your kids.

181
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:16,547
You want to work here...
close!

182
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,883
You think this is abuse?

183
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,052
You think this is abuse,
you cocksucker?

184
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:25,764
You can't take this, how can you
take the abuse you get on a sit?

185
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:30,352
You don't like it, leave.

186
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:35,732
I can go out there tonight...
the materials you got...

187
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:39,903
make myself $15,000.
Tonight... in two hours!

188
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,780
Can you?

189
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:45,576
Can you?

190
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:50,539
Go and do likewise.
"A-I-D-A."

191
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:53,208
Get mad, you son of a bitches.
Get mad!

192
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:57,212
You know what it takes
to sell real estate?

193
00:13:57,296 --> 00:14:00,966
It takes brass balls
to sell real estate.

194
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:08,307
Go and do likewise,
gents.

195
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,809
The money's out there...
you pick it up, it's yours,

196
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,145
you don't,
I got no sympathy for you.

197
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,063
You want to go out
on those sits tonight and close...

198
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:16,857
close... it's yours.

199
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,109
Not, you're gonna be
shining my shoes.

200
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:21,904
And you know
what you'll be saying.

201
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:24,615
Bunch of losers
sitting around in a bar,

202
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:28,785
"Oh yeah, I used to be a salesman.
It's a tough racket."

203
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:39,922
These are the new leads.

204
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:43,050
These are
the Glengarry leads.

205
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:47,804
And to you, they're gold.
And you don't get them.

206
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,641
Why?

207
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:54,728
Because to give them to you
is just throwing them away.

208
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:01,193
They're for closers.

209
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:08,492
I'd wish you good luck,

210
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,786
but you wouldn't know what
to do with it if you got it.

211
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:19,962
And to answer your question, pal...
"Why am I here?"

212
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:23,006
I came here because
Mitch and Murray asked me to.

213
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,801
They asked me for a favor.
I said, "The real favor...

214
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:28,846
follow my advice
and fire your fucking ass,

215
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,431
because a loser
is a loser."

216
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:45,070
Bunch of fucking nonsense...

217
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,865
treat people like that.

218
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:52,578
The fuck is he going
to get off?

219
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:56,039
- Mickey Mouse sales conference.
- He didn't mean it.

220
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:58,959
I'm sure he didn't mean it about
trimming down the sales quota.

221
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,211
Where is Roma?
Where the hell is Mr. Ricky Roma?

222
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:03,672
All the while we got to sit here,
eat this nonsense?

223
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,884
Hello? Mr. Levene.
How's she doing?

224
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,927
Uh-huh, yeah.
Is she awake?

225
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:11,555
Oh, the doctor came by.
What did he say?

226
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:15,184
Uh-huh.
I can't come in tonight.

227
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:18,020
I think... I know she is.
I know that she is.

228
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:21,940
I've gotta go out. Will you please
tell her when she wakes?

229
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:25,986
I've got to go out.
Tell her I'll call her from the road.

230
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,654
Thank you.

231
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:33,076
Gentlemen,
you heard the man.

232
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:34,912
What is this in aid of?

233
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,080
- As of tonight...
- What is this? Excuse me.

234
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:39,333
What it's in aid of
is that Mitch and Murray...

235
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,127
Fuck Mitch and Murray!
I'm doing my job,

236
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:44,004
I got to put up
with this childishness?

237
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,964
I don't make the rules.
I'm paid to run the office.

238
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,383
You don't like the rules, Dave?
There's the door!

239
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:54,890
Two lead cards for tonight,
two lead cards for tomorrow.

240
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,683
As you heard,
end of the month,

241
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,852
top salesman on the board
gets the Eldorado.

242
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:01,063
- Next man down the...
- What about the good leads?

243
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,482
- The leads I've given you.
- But these leads are shit.

244
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,400
They're old...
I've seen that name 100 times.

245
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:08,570
- The leads are assigned randomly.
- What about the new leads?

246
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,447
The new leads...
the Glengarry leads.

247
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:12,866
I've got them.
I'm going to hang onto them.

248
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,035
And they'll be
assigned to closers,

249
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,454
based on the sales volume,
first to Roma.

250
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:19,456
- Where is Roma?
- Don't worry about Roma.

251
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,166
He'll get his leads,
you've got yours.

252
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,377
He's top name on the board,
so he don't have to be here?

253
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,921
That's correct!
And as the hour is waning,

254
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:28,841
I suggest you... those of you
who are interested

255
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:31,718
in a continuing job with
this organization, get to work.

256
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:33,804
That's garbage.
Bullshit.

257
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,597
- Thank you for your attention.
- Bullshit!

258
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:39,768
How am I supposed to close these?
Look at this.

259
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:42,813
I've had this guy before.
I've been to his house twice.

260
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:46,608
I... I can't...
I can't close this stuff.

261
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:52,364
Shelly, how am I
supposed to...

262
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:55,117
They're going
to bounce me out of a job.

263
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,712
Hello, Mr. Palermo?
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:10,174
Mr. Speice?
Mr. Robert Speice?

265
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:13,177
Yeah,
this is George Aaronow.

266
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:16,388
I'm with Rio.
I spoke with your wife earlier.

267
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:20,017
I'm the vice president of Rio Rancho
Properties in Furman, Arizona.

268
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:25,314
Yes. I'm calling from the airport,
and consulting my map,

269
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:27,608
I see that you and your wife
live near the airport.

270
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:30,694
I have some rather...
rather unusual,

271
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,030
rather good information
on the property...

272
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:37,284
Hello? Hello, this is
Sheldon Levene.

273
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:39,912
Please listen closely...
I only have a moment or so.

274
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:43,582
I can speak only
to a Mrs. Nyborg.

275
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:47,586
Oh, this is Mrs. Nyborg.
Please listen closely, Mrs. Nyborg.

276
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:51,381
I'm calling from Consolidated
Properties of Arizona.

277
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:55,177
Our computer has chosen you
from all of the many thousands

278
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,096
who write in requesting
information on our properties.

279
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:01,141
Now by federal law,
as you probably know,

280
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:04,394
the prize must be awarded to you
even if you are not engaged

281
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:06,480
in our land
development plan.

282
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:10,192
The only stipulation, of course,
is that you and your husband

283
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:13,403
must sign at the same time
for the receipt of your prize.

284
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:17,908
Now, I will be in the area
tonight, possibly tomorrow.

285
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,536
What do you think might be
a convenient time to meet

286
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,746
with both you
and your husband?

287
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:25,415
Of course I'll hold.

288
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:41,265
- Bunch of fucking nonsense, huh?
- I can't close them.

289
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:42,850
- Nobody can close 'em.
- They're old.

290
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:45,102
They're ancient...
a bunch of fucking nonsense.

291
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,479
Get some jerk
to come in here...

292
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:50,357
Sometimes I think,
"I wonder if I belong in this business."

293
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,818
Send a guy out there...
no support, no confidence.

294
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,529
Then I say,
"Nobody can close 'em."

295
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:58,115
- Then I look at Roma.
- Roma... fuck Roma.

296
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,284
Had a freak...
a little run of luck.

297
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,786
The leads are garbage.

298
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:04,955
Then I say,
"Why give him the good leads?

299
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:07,124
- He doesn't need 'em."
- You going out?

300
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:11,795
Yeah. I have to go out.
I can't make a sit.

301
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:15,799
- Have you tried?
- Yeah. Something's wrong with me.

302
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,843
What is it?
I can't push through.

303
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:20,137
Get your coat on.
You're coming out with me.

304
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:22,306
- Something in me.
- Forget it.

305
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:25,434
- I try, I try.
- I said forget it, come on.

306
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:27,769
I can't close 'em.

307
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:33,025
Life.

308
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,319
I swear to God,
you work all your life...

309
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:39,489
- Forget it, George.
- Roma, so on...

310
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:41,992
- so gifted.
- Gifted, my ass!

311
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:45,621
- The guy gets a string of luck.
- No, no, no.

312
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:47,414
The thing of it is,
money's tight.

313
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:49,374
When times are tight,
it don't do no good

314
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,793
to throw around,
"Just go out and sell."

315
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:54,588
Threaten a man all you want,
you can't whip a dead horse.

316
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,215
- Nope.
- All this garbage...

317
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:57,758
"Sell 10,000,
you win a Cadillac;

318
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:01,094
you lose, we're gonna fire
your ass"? It's medieval.

319
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:02,346
- Yes.
- It's wrong.

320
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:03,889
- Yes.
- Yes it is,

321
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:05,516
and you know
who's responsible?

322
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:07,559
- Who?
- You know who it is.

323
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,520
It's Mitch and Murray,
'cause it don't have to be this way.

324
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,605
- No.
- Look at Jerry Graff.

325
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:13,690
He's clean, he's doing
business for himself,

326
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:15,901
he's got that list...
with the nurses?

327
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:20,405
You see? That's thinking.
Why take a 10% sales commission?

328
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:23,700
Why are we giving the rest away?
What are we giving 90% for?

329
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:26,662
For nothing.
For some jerk in the office,

330
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:29,081
telling us, "Get out there and close,
go win a Cadillac."

331
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:31,750
Graff goes out and buys.
He pays top dollar.

332
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:33,252
- You see?
- Yes.

333
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:36,296
For the leads... that's thinking.
Now, he's got the leads,

334
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:40,551
he goes in business for himself.
That's what? That's thinking.

335
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,594
Who... who's got
a steady job,

336
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:44,763
a regular job,
a couple of bucks nobody's touched?

337
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:46,348
Nurses.

338
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,058
Graff goes and buys
a fucking list of nurses. One grand...

339
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,477
he paid two, I'll eat my hat.
4,000 or 5,000 nurses.

340
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:52,938
- He's going wild.
- He is?

341
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:56,233
- Yeah, he's doing very well.
- I heard they were running cold.

342
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,110
- The nurses?
- Yeah.

343
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:01,363
You hear a lot of things.
He's doing very well.

344
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:03,282
- With River Oaks?
- River Oaks, Brook Farms.

345
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:06,076
All that shit. Somebody told me...
you know what he's clearing, himself?

346
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:08,912
- 14, 15 grand a week.
- Himself?

347
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:12,332
That's what I'm saying.
Why? He's got the leads.

348
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,460
He's got the good leads.
What are we?

349
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,296
We're sitting
in the shit here. Why?

350
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:19,214
Because we got to go to them
to get them.

351
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:22,176
90% of our sales we're paying
to the office for the leads.

352
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:25,679
There's our leads, there's overhead,
phones, a lot of stuff.

353
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:27,723
What do you need?
A telephone?

354
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:30,934
Some broad to say, "Good morning"?
Nothing. It's the leads.

355
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,604
The whole thing is the leads,
you understand me?

356
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:36,481
You can't sell to a void...
you got to get a goddamn person.

357
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:39,109
You get a lead, you get
a person... I'll go sell 'em.

358
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:40,986
Otherwise, what do they want
from my life?

359
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:45,073
Hello, Danny?
Dan, it's Shel Levene.

360
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:48,202
Yeah, we spoke...
last May I called you.

361
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:51,455
I was in town from my estate
in Rio Rancho, and...

362
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,248
Arizona.

363
00:22:53,332 --> 00:22:55,584
I wish we could have
gotten together at that time.

364
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:59,379
Danny, that piece of property I had
for you has increased in value...

365
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:04,676
Grace, Grace,
what was that figure? $76,000.

366
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,221
Oh, Danny, I wish you could have
been in on it with me.

367
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:09,890
Look, I'm here overnight...
I have to go home tomorrow,

368
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:13,810
and I thought, after the interest
you showed on the last trip, that...

369
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:17,814
Hold it, Grace. Danny,
I know that you're serious,

370
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:20,943
and because of that, I am going
to shove my appointments around

371
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:25,072
and make sure...
oh, gee, I wish that...

372
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:30,118
All right, Danny.
Yeah, all right.

373
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:43,966
Going out tonight,
Shelly?

374
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:49,805
What is this bullshit
with the sales promotion?

375
00:23:49,847 --> 00:23:51,348
It isn't bullshit.
It's the way it is.

376
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:53,517
You're going to fire
the bottom men on the list?

377
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,019
That's the way it is
and I don't make the rules.

378
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:59,398
- The rules come from downtown.
- I got a problem here, John.

379
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:01,984
- I'm closing up the office.
- Come have a drink with me.

380
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:05,320
- I've got to get home.
- Do me the courtesy... five minutes?

381
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:07,531
I am trying to get home
for two hours.

382
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:10,617
I got to go home, grab one hour
with my kids, come back here,

383
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:13,162
see if any of you closed
a contract, take the contract...

384
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:16,790
- How about one minute?
- What is it?

385
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:18,917
- I can't close these leads.
- Then move on.

386
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:22,880
Don't jump! Don't jump out
of your manager bag a second.

387
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:27,176
It's just two guys talking,
am I right? We're just talking.

388
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:29,845
You got the new leads.
If you would give me... just hold on.

389
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:32,681
The Glengarry leads are to be
assigned only to closers.

390
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:35,517
Hold on a second.
If you give me the good leads...

391
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,186
You blew the last good one
I gave you.

392
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:38,937
No, no... hold on,
will you?

393
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:41,607
I did not blow 'em.
One kicked out. One, I closed.

394
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,567
- You didn't close it.
- Would you listen to me?

395
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:47,446
I closed that cocksucker!
His ex! John, his ex!

396
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,990
I didn't even know he was married.
The judge invalidated it.

397
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:50,949
Shelly...

398
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:53,577
What was that job, huh?
Bad luck. That's all it was.

399
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,829
I pray you never find it...
it runs in streaks.

400
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:58,790
That's what it's doing,
that's all it does... streaks.

401
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:02,461
I pray that it misses you
and that's all I have to say.

402
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:05,506
Shit, I've got to eat.
Williamson...

403
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:09,718
look at the sheets.
Look at the sheets.

404
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:13,514
1987, '88, '89...
six months in '89... who's on top?

405
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:15,057
- Roma.
- Under him?

406
00:25:15,057 --> 00:25:17,851
- Moss.
- Oh, bullshit, John!

407
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:20,521
April to September it's me...
it's no fucking Moss.

408
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:22,940
Due respect,
he's an order-taker.

409
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:26,693
Talk... talks a good game,
but look on the board, it's me.

410
00:25:26,777 --> 00:25:28,946
- Not lately it isn't.
- Not late...

411
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:31,406
Well, lately...
kiss my ass "lately".

412
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,159
You call Murray and you call Mitch...
when we were on Peterson,

413
00:25:34,243 --> 00:25:36,870
who do you think bought the new car?
Call Mitch. The Seville?

414
00:25:36,954 --> 00:25:40,040
He came in here...
"You bought that for me, fella."

415
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:44,044
And out of what? Hey, look at me!
Out of what? Nothing!

416
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:46,338
Cold calling.
You want to talk about a sale?

417
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:48,924
You are really
beginning to burn my ass, kid.

418
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:53,387
I can't get a lead, you...
it was skill, John.

419
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,931
It could be working for you...
you want to throw it away.

420
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:58,183
- It isn't me.
- It's not you...

421
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:00,769
I wonder who it is.
Who the fuck am I talking to?

422
00:26:00,853 --> 00:26:04,606
- I need the leads to sell.
- After the contest. After the 30th.

423
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,942
Bullshit,
"After the contest."

424
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:09,695
If I'm not on that board by the 30th,
they're going to can my ass.

425
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:16,493
I need those leads
and I need 'em now or I'm out.

426
00:26:21,165 --> 00:26:27,421
You're going to miss me.
I swear to you, you will miss me.

427
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:29,256
Let me tell you
something, Shelly.

428
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:32,342
I do what I'm hired to do...
you might do the same.

429
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:34,303
- Jesus.
- Now wait a second!

430
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:39,850
I'm hired to watch the leads,
to marshal my sales force.

431
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:42,019
I'm given a policy.
My job is to do that.

432
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:44,146
Marshal your sales force?

433
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:46,899
Anybody falls below
a certain mark, I'm directed.

434
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:48,942
I'm not permitted
to give them the premium leads.

435
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:52,946
How do they rise
above that mark? With dreck?

436
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:55,324
With this toilet paper
you're giving me?

437
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:56,992
You give me
one premium lead...

438
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:58,785
Do you know what
the premium leads cost?

439
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:01,121
Do I know what
the premium leads cost?

440
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:02,623
Yeah,
I know what they cost.

441
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:05,918
I generated the sufficient
dollar revenue to buy them.

442
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:08,962
But I cannot sell shit!

443
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:11,632
Jesus. And I've seen
these before, you know.

444
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,634
Christ, I saw these back...
Homestead...

445
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:16,011
1985, we pitched
these cocksuckers Baywater.

446
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:20,390
They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.
They're broke. They're deadbeats.

447
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:23,393
Just give me some leads that don't
come out of a phone book.

448
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:26,146
You give me something hotter
than that and I can close it.

449
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,440
It's just a streak.
I'm gonna turn it around.

450
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:31,777
Hey, I need your help.

451
00:27:33,904 --> 00:27:36,740
I can't do it,
Shelly.

452
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:44,289
John...

453
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:47,000
I'll give you 10%.

454
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:49,670
- Of what?
- My end... what I close.

455
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:52,673
You give me the premium leads,
you're in for 10%, what I close.

456
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,591
- And what if you don't close?
- I will.

457
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:56,677
- What if you don't close?
- I will close.

458
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,846
What if you don't,
you understand?

459
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:01,849
Then I'm fucked. You think you're
the only guy with a family?

460
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,642
- You see what I'm saying?
- John...

461
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:05,978
I step out and you don't close,
then it's my job.

462
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:08,021
- Then I'm fucked.
- I will close!

463
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:10,816
Now, 10%John...
I can get hot, you know that.

464
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:13,443
- Not lately you can't.
- That's defeatist... fuck it!

465
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:16,446
Go with me. Get on my side
and let's do something.

466
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:19,199
You want to run this office?
You heard what the man said...

467
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:21,702
"Attack."
Let's do something.

468
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:26,206
- Huh?
- 20%.

469
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:30,252
- All right.
- And 50 bucks a lead.

470
00:28:30,294 --> 00:28:32,296
- No?
- Oh!

471
00:28:39,178 --> 00:28:40,929
Oh, shit.

472
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:58,655
Listen...
I got to talk to you.

473
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:03,619
Permit me to do this a second.
I'm older than you.

474
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,997
A man acquires a reputation
on the street.

475
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,791
What he does when he's up,
what he does at other times...

476
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:13,086
I said, "10," you said, "No."
You said, "20," I said, "Fine."

477
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:16,548
Now you want to throw
this 50-buck thing in.

478
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:21,470
John, a good deal... has got to be
one where both parties...

479
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:24,765
Okay, okay, okay, fine...
20%, 50 bucks a lead. It's done.

480
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:26,767
Let's go out.
We make some money.

481
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:29,436
I got bills to pay.
I want two sits tonight

482
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,189
and I want the good leads...
the Glengarry leads... two.

483
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:34,441
Two, John, because
I am going to close 'em both.

484
00:29:34,525 --> 00:29:37,319
It's a long road
with no turning, pally.

485
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:40,280
Huh? Okay.
Now, let's go.

486
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:42,950
I've got to go back
to the office to get 'em.

487
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:46,912
Go on, let's go.
This is what I was saying, John.

488
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:49,665
All you need, a little boost,
you turn a streak around.

489
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:52,793
Am I right? Good, huh?
Huh, good?

490
00:29:52,835 --> 00:29:55,295
What?

491
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:58,131
- What?
- Two leads, 100 bucks.

492
00:29:58,173 --> 00:30:00,300
- Now?
- Now, yes. When?

493
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:02,636
- Shit, John.
- I wish I could.

494
00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:05,389
You fucking asshole.

495
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:08,725
I don't have it...
I don't...

496
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:11,144
I'll bring it in the office
in the morning.

497
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:13,605
- I'll be coming with the sales.
- Nope.

498
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:18,735
I can't fucking
believe this.

499
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:22,156
All right, here's...

500
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:24,032
20... 30, and...

501
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:27,661
Jesus, here's the 30.
I'll bring the rest in tomorrow.

502
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:29,955
We got to do this, huh, pal?
For Christ's sake!

503
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:31,832
No.

504
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:37,838
- My daughter...
- I can't do it, Shelly.

505
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:41,008
I got to tell you something.
It wasn't so long ago,

506
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:44,928
I'd pick up the phone
and call Murray... I got your job.

507
00:30:45,012 --> 00:30:48,390
"Murray, the kid is burning my ass."
"Shelly, he's gone."

508
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:53,270
You are gone before
I'm back from lunch.

509
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:55,063
Bought him a trip
to Bermuda once.

510
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:56,982
- I've got to go.
- All right, hey.

511
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:01,612
Give me... I'll take two more
of the old leads.

512
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:04,281
- I gave you two today.
- One is a bust-out, John!

513
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:06,325
- The other ain't home!
- Shelly...

514
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:07,534
I promise you,
I've been on the phone... I know.

515
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:09,286
No more leads today...
two per day. You've got yours.

516
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:11,371
All right.

517
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:13,874
- All right?
- Sure.

518
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:23,550
We will do that...
other thing.

519
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,430
I guess I left
my wallet in my room.

520
00:31:34,603 --> 00:31:37,606
Deadbeats.
Deadbeats, all of 'em.

521
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:41,401
My mistake.
I shouldn't have took the leads.

522
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:43,737
- You had to.
- Yeah? Why?

523
00:31:43,821 --> 00:31:46,073
- To get on the...
- To get on the board, yeah.

524
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:48,242
How am I gonna get on the board
trying to sell a doctor?

525
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:50,077
Two regular,
two chocolate donuts.

526
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:53,205
Give me the same thing to go.
And don't try and sell an Indian.

527
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:54,957
I will never try to sell
an Indian.

528
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,292
These names come up...
you ever get 'em... "Patel"?

529
00:31:57,376 --> 00:32:00,337
- You ever get 'em?
- I think I had one once.

530
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,714
You had one,
you'd know it... "Patel."

531
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:04,424
They keep coming up.
I don't know.

532
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:06,844
They like to talk to salesmen.
They're lonely.

533
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:09,638
They like to feel superior...
never bought a fucking thing.

534
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:12,307
I don't know.
Come down the line...

535
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:16,854
doctors, lawyers, Indians...
times are tight. It's tight.

536
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:21,441
Pressure's just too great.
Man can't work all of 'em.

537
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:25,237
You go in the door... I got to close
this fucker or I don't eat lunch,

538
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,032
or I don't win a Cadillac.
We work too hard, George.

539
00:32:31,243 --> 00:32:36,498
Remember when we were... when we
were selling Glen Ross Farms?

540
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:38,834
Didn't we sell
a bunch of that?

541
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:41,086
- They came in...
- They fucked it up.

542
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,088
- They did.
- They killed the goose. And now...

543
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:45,465
- We're stuck with this...
- Stuck with this fucking shit.

544
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:47,176
- This shit.
- It's too...

545
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:49,511
- It is.
- You get a bad month...

546
00:32:49,595 --> 00:32:53,015
they put you on this board.
Some contest board.

547
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:55,559
- It's not right.
- It's not right to the customers.

548
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:57,936
I know, it's... hey. What did I learn
as a kid on Western?

549
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:03,984
Don't sell a guy one car.
Sell him five cars over 15 years.

550
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,777
- That's right.
- You're goddamn right, it's right.

551
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:08,822
Guys come in... "Oh, the blah,
blah, blah. I know what I'll do.

552
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:11,325
I'll go out and rob everybody
blind and go to Argentina

553
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:13,243
'cause nobody ever
thought of this before."

554
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:16,163
So they kill the goose
and the man's worked all his life...

555
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:18,165
- That's right.
- He's got to cower in his boots...

556
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:19,291
Boots, yes...

557
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:22,711
For some fucking "Sell 10,000,
win the steak knives."

558
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:24,671
- What do you do?
- What can you do?

559
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:27,174
What can you do
if you don't have the leads?

560
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:29,968
If you do not
have the goddamn leads!

561
00:33:30,177 --> 00:33:33,055
Mr. Spannel?
Sheldon Levene.

562
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:35,140
I was speaking
to your wife earlier?

563
00:33:35,224 --> 00:33:37,142
Come in.

564
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:40,604
- "Cats and dogs," huh?
- Yeah.

565
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:43,315
Oh, "cats and dogs."

566
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:48,403
Oh, I see you're
interested in fishing.

567
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:51,198
- Yeah.
- I've fished myself... many years.

568
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,076
Muskee, Wisconsin.
Ooh, a beauty.

569
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:58,831
- Where's the missus?
- Out at the PTA.

570
00:33:58,914 --> 00:34:00,749
- Ahh.
- What was this in reference...?

571
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,876
I spoke to your wife
earlier on the phone.

572
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,878
I called, I'm in town
with Rio Rancho.

573
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,131
Yes, I'm sorry. She said you had
some sort of award?

574
00:34:08,215 --> 00:34:11,468
Yes, I was speaking to the people
in my sales organization...

575
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:15,305
my representatives in this area...
and Mr. Spannel...

576
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:18,225
your name is Larry.
Mind if I call you Larry?

577
00:34:18,267 --> 00:34:21,979
All right, Larry.
We had a consultant,

578
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:25,190
and he made me...
he made me an offer.

579
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:28,819
He offered me $230,000
to promote a sales plan...

580
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:33,407
to present investment opportunities
in Rio Rancho to the public.

581
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,743
Well, I said, "Hell,
let me save you the 230,

582
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:39,872
and pass the savings
along to the investor."

583
00:34:39,955 --> 00:34:43,125
My people immediately said,
"Whoa, how do you do that?

584
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:46,170
How can you present
investment opportunities

585
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:48,422
without television,
without magazine ads?"

586
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:50,424
I said, "You take
something this good,

587
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:52,718
you go to a man...
has invested in the past...

588
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:56,638
you go to him direct and offer
the money to him... rebate.

589
00:34:56,722 --> 00:34:59,850
And don't give it
to this expert."

590
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:03,312
So you're here
to sell me some land?

591
00:35:03,395 --> 00:35:05,564
No, I wouldn't try
to sell you...

592
00:35:05,647 --> 00:35:08,984
I leave that to the salesmen
and people who want to own land.

593
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:11,820
I think something
has to be fed,

594
00:35:11,904 --> 00:35:14,823
watered and painted,
but don't invest in it.

595
00:35:14,907 --> 00:35:17,409
That motto has stood me
in good stead.

596
00:35:17,493 --> 00:35:19,703
- Mister...
- Just call me Shelly.

597
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:21,997
I have never
been afraid of familiarity.

598
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,082
I'm walking out the door.
I've got to pick up my wife at the...

599
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:26,585
Let's take my car.
We'll pick her up together.

600
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:28,879
Spoke to the little woman
on the phone... can't wait to meet her.

601
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:30,756
No, we're going
over to our relatives'.

602
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:33,467
- She didn't say anything about that.
- I'm sure she forgot.

603
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:36,178
- I'm on a plane to Florida...
- I'm sorry if we put you out.

604
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:38,764
You didn't put me out.
I'm just trying to think, Larry.

605
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:41,433
You know, that's the only parcel
that I've got.

606
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:44,228
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go back to the computer,

607
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:47,439
I'm gonna pull another one, and we're
gonna speak to your relatives, too.

608
00:35:47,523 --> 00:35:49,900
- No, no, no.
- C'mon, you're a busy man, so am I.

609
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:52,820
My God, I'm in the act
of giving a gift away.

610
00:35:52,903 --> 00:35:55,823
Look, I don't want to buy land.
I don't want to invest in land.

611
00:35:55,906 --> 00:36:00,452
I have nothing. She took the call
without my knowledge.

612
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:02,788
I have no business
that I wish to transact.

613
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:04,706
I don't want to tell you
how to handle your wife.

614
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:08,669
My wife filled in a form, and we
have been plagued for the last year...

615
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,713
That's the situation
I'm trying to alleviate, Larry.

616
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:13,549
No, no.
Do you understand?

617
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:16,635
Thank you. No.

618
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:34,611
- Roma, man... he don't care.
- He don't care.

619
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:38,073
He's sitting on top of the world.
He's got good leads, good prospects.

620
00:36:38,157 --> 00:36:40,534
- Sales, sales.
- Sales contests.

621
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:43,412
- That's what I'm saying.
- Times turn hard, they bounce you out.

622
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:45,497
If they bounce you with no
confidence...

623
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:48,167
That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying to you.

624
00:36:53,547 --> 00:36:56,008
If they get you
on a bad beat...

625
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:58,552
and you got to go out there,
get a new job...

626
00:36:58,635 --> 00:37:00,387
- With no...
- With no confidence...

627
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:02,014
Yes.

628
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:06,310
I'll tell you what the hard part is...
to stop thinking like a goddamn slave.

629
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:09,855
You say the Nazis in Europe...
"If they came in my door"...

630
00:37:09,938 --> 00:37:12,316
bullshit, the time is now.
What do you do now?

631
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:14,693
Some guy pissing in your face.
Cocksucker...

632
00:37:14,776 --> 00:37:17,237
wants to break your rice bowl.

633
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:20,866
Mitch and Murray, fuck you.
What I say... fuck you!

634
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:23,744
Sitting on the good leads.

635
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:26,663
George, we're men here.

636
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:29,249
Yes.

637
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:33,253
And I'll tell you...
I'll tell you what the hard part is.

638
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:35,923
- What?
- Starting up.

639
00:37:36,006 --> 00:37:38,717
Standing up.
Breaking free of this bullshit,

640
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,513
this enslavement to some guy,
'cause he's got the upper hand.

641
00:37:45,265 --> 00:37:48,227
This is the difference...
listen to me, George.

642
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:50,437
Now Jerry Graff went
into business for himself.

643
00:37:50,521 --> 00:37:56,109
He said, "I'm going on my own."
And he was free, you understand me?

644
00:37:57,319 --> 00:38:00,322
I'll tell you... I'll tell you
what somebody should do.

645
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:04,368
What?

646
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:07,079
Somebody should stand up
and strike back.

647
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,456
Somebody should do something
to them.

648
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,750
- What?
- Something to pay them back.

649
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:13,669
Someone should hurt them,
Mitch and Murray.

650
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:15,420
- Somebody should hurt them?
- Yeah.

651
00:38:15,504 --> 00:38:17,381
- How?
- Someone should do something

652
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,174
- to hurt them where they live.
- What?

653
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:22,427
Someone should rob the office.
That's what I'm saying.

654
00:38:22,511 --> 00:38:25,973
If we were that kind of guy
to hold up the joint and trash it,

655
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:29,101
it looks like robbery,
we take the leads out of the files

656
00:38:29,142 --> 00:38:31,103
and we go to Jerry Graff.

657
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:34,982
And we take the fucking
Glengarry leads! Huh?

658
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:41,113
Yeah, Mr. Nyborg? Ah, Mr. Nyborg,
Sheldon Levene.

659
00:38:41,155 --> 00:38:43,782
I was speaking to your wife earlier.
That's right.

660
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:47,494
I'd like to speak to you
about awarding you your prize.

661
00:38:47,578 --> 00:38:49,580
We're coming to the end
of our fiscal year,

662
00:38:49,663 --> 00:38:52,332
I'd really like to get it
off the books before...

663
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:55,419
yes, the prize
for Consolidated Properties.

664
00:38:55,502 --> 00:38:58,005
The information you requested
on Rio Rancho.

665
00:38:58,088 --> 00:39:01,300
Now, I'm in town only for...
well, let me see.

666
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:04,344
I suppose I could
swing by tonight. Yes. Uh-huh.

667
00:39:04,386 --> 00:39:06,972
When do you think
it might be more convenient?

668
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:09,641
As I said,
I could swing by tonight...

669
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:12,186
well, of course,
you speak to your wife.

670
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:14,188
Grace, I'm gonna need

671
00:39:14,271 --> 00:39:16,815
a first-class seat,
passport, 10,000 in cash,

672
00:39:16,899 --> 00:39:19,151
put that with the negotiable
papers, if you would.

673
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:23,447
And put me
on the telex hookup... yes?

674
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,992
Well, when do you think
Mrs. Nyborg might be back?

675
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:30,496
All train compartments
smell vaguely of shit.

676
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:33,790
It gets so you don't
mind it.

677
00:39:33,874 --> 00:39:37,002
That's the worst thing
that I can confess.

678
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:39,671
You know how long it took me
to get there? A long time.

679
00:39:41,423 --> 00:39:45,886
When you die you're gonna regret
the things you don't do.

680
00:39:45,928 --> 00:39:49,014
You think you're queer?
I'm gonna tell you something.

681
00:39:49,097 --> 00:39:52,559
We're all queer.
You think you're a thief? So what?

682
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:55,187
You get befuddled
by a middle-class morality?

683
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:57,231
Get shut of it.
Shut it out.

684
00:39:57,272 --> 00:40:01,360
You cheat on your wife,
you did it. Live with it.

685
00:40:01,443 --> 00:40:04,696
You fuck little girls,
so be it.

686
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,534
There's an absolute morality?
Maybe.

687
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:11,245
And then what?

688
00:40:11,328 --> 00:40:14,873
If you think there is,
go ahead, be that thing.

689
00:40:15,082 --> 00:40:17,876
Bad people go to hell?
I don't think so.

690
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,920
You think that,
act that way.

691
00:40:19,962 --> 00:40:26,385
A hell exists on earth?
Yes. I won't live in it.

692
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:28,428
That's me.

693
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,979
Did you ever take a dump, made you
feel like you slept for 12 hours?

694
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:39,690
- Did I...?
- Yes.

695
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:43,277
- I don't know.
- Or a piss?

696
00:40:47,656 --> 00:40:50,617
Great meals fade
in reflection.

697
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:53,370
Everything else gains.
Do you know why?

698
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:56,832
'Cause it's only food.
This shit we put in us,

699
00:40:56,915 --> 00:40:59,334
keeps us going...
it's only food.

700
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:02,880
The great fucks
you may have had,

701
00:41:02,963 --> 00:41:04,923
what do you remember
about them?

702
00:41:04,965 --> 00:41:09,052
- What do I remember?
- Yeah.

703
00:41:10,846 --> 00:41:12,556
I don't know.
For me,

704
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:16,143
I'm saying what it is,
it's probably not the orgasm.

705
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:21,607
Some broad's forearm
on your neck,

706
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:26,153
something her eyes did.
There was this sound she made.

707
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:30,115
Or it's me in the...
I'm telling you...

708
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:34,161
I'm in bed the next day,
she brought me caf au lait,

709
00:41:34,203 --> 00:41:37,664
gives me a cigarette,
my balls feel like concrete.

710
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:39,249
Eh?

711
00:41:41,335 --> 00:41:43,670
What I'm saying,
what is our life?

712
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:49,092
Our life is looking forward
or it's looking back.

713
00:41:49,176 --> 00:41:52,971
That's it.
That's our life.

714
00:41:53,055 --> 00:41:55,641
Where's the moment?

715
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:03,148
And what is it
we're so afraid of?

716
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,108
Loss. What else?

717
00:42:05,192 --> 00:42:10,322
The bank closes, we get sick,
my wife died on a plane?

718
00:42:11,782 --> 00:42:14,993
The stock market collapsed?
What of these things happen?

719
00:42:15,035 --> 00:42:18,163
None of them.
We worry anyway. Why?

720
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:21,500
What could we get
for them?

721
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:24,336
- For them?
- For the leads.

722
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:26,380
What could we get
for the leads?

723
00:42:26,463 --> 00:42:30,843
I don't know. 10 bucks a throw.
15 maybe. I don't know.

724
00:42:32,386 --> 00:42:35,055
For the leads, you're saying?
Say somebody took them,

725
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:38,267
- went to Jerry Graff?
- Yeah. How many leads do we have?

726
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:39,643
The Glengarry?
The premium leads?

727
00:42:39,726 --> 00:42:42,938
I've got to think they've got 500.
Say 500 leads.

728
00:42:43,021 --> 00:42:46,275
You're saying a fella could take
those leads and sell them to Graff?

729
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:48,610
The leads to Graff.
Yes. I was saying... yeah.

730
00:42:48,694 --> 00:42:51,280
A guy could take...
like anything else, it seems to me,

731
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:53,866
that is negotiable,
a guy could sell them.

732
00:42:53,949 --> 00:42:57,327
- How do you know he'd buy them?
- Because I worked for him.

733
00:42:57,411 --> 00:43:01,123
- You didn't talk to him?
- No. What do you mean?

734
00:43:01,206 --> 00:43:03,292
- Did I talk to him about this?
- Yeah.

735
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:05,669
Are you just talking about this,
or are we just talking about it?

736
00:43:05,711 --> 00:43:08,172
- Just speaking about it.
- Speaking about it as an idea?

737
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:10,340
- Yes.
- We're not actually talking about it.

738
00:43:10,382 --> 00:43:13,177
- No.
- Talking about it as a robbery.

739
00:43:13,218 --> 00:43:16,013
As a robbery? No.

740
00:43:18,432 --> 00:43:20,684
- Well...
- Hey.

741
00:43:20,726 --> 00:43:23,520
So all this...
you didn't actually call Graff?

742
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:26,064
- You didn't talk to him?
- Not actually, no.

743
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:28,358
- You didn't?
- No, not actually.

744
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:30,027
- Did you?
- What did I say?

745
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,904
- What did you say?
- I said, "Not actually".

746
00:43:31,987 --> 00:43:34,156
Fuck you care, George?
We're just talking.

747
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:35,532
- We are?
- Yes.

748
00:43:35,574 --> 00:43:38,994
- Because it's a crime.
- Robbery. That's right.

749
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:42,706
It is a crime.

750
00:43:45,334 --> 00:43:48,253
- It's also very safe.
- You're actually talking about this.

751
00:43:48,253 --> 00:43:51,089
- That's right.
- You're going to steal the leads.

752
00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:52,591
- Have I said that?
- Are you?

753
00:43:52,633 --> 00:43:54,426
- Did I say that?
- Did you talk to Graff?

754
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:56,094
- What did I say?
- What did he say?

755
00:43:56,178 --> 00:43:57,971
What did he say?

756
00:44:01,183 --> 00:44:03,268
He'd buy them.

757
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:14,279
You're gonna steal...

758
00:44:14,363 --> 00:44:17,533
you're gonna steal the Glengarry
leads and sell them to Graff?

759
00:44:17,616 --> 00:44:20,619
- Yes.
- What's he gonna pay?

760
00:44:20,702 --> 00:44:23,914
He figures there's 500 leads,
let's say 10 bucks apiece,

761
00:44:23,997 --> 00:44:27,584
- that's $2,500 each.
- Each?

762
00:44:27,668 --> 00:44:29,628
- "Each"?
- That's right, George.

763
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:32,130
- You're saying me?
- No, you and me.

764
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:36,426
Yeah. That's exactly
what I'm saying. $2,500 apiece.

765
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,804
You and me for one night's work,
and a job with Graff

766
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:41,640
- working the premium leads.
- A job with Graff?

767
00:44:41,723 --> 00:44:44,101
- Is that what I said?
- He'd give me a job?

768
00:44:44,184 --> 00:44:46,270
He could take you on.
Yes.

769
00:45:09,001 --> 00:45:10,460
Hello?

770
00:45:10,544 --> 00:45:12,963
I was dialing the direct line
to my daughter's room.

771
00:45:13,005 --> 00:45:15,757
Sheldon Levene.
She's in...

772
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:20,387
well, yeah, I'm sure she's asleep.
But... where's the duty nurse?

773
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,975
They canceled her...
well, let me talk...

774
00:45:25,058 --> 00:45:27,060
who am I speaking to?

775
00:45:29,855 --> 00:45:33,108
I'll have the money there
tomorrow.

776
00:45:33,692 --> 00:45:35,652
It's a big decision,
George.

777
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:39,114
At times a guy
has got to make one.

778
00:45:39,198 --> 00:45:41,283
It's a big decision
and it's a big reward.

779
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:44,661
$2,500 and a job, it's a big reward
for one night's work.

780
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:46,830
Yes.

781
00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:49,374
Sometimes a guy...

782
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:51,835
sometimes, a man
if he wants a reward...

783
00:45:51,877 --> 00:45:54,463
That's absolutely right.

784
00:45:54,546 --> 00:45:56,507
He'll do one thing,
one thing on one night.

785
00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:01,178
That's absolutely right.
The thing is, it's got to be tonight.

786
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,304
What?

787
00:46:02,387 --> 00:46:04,348
What, what?
The leads ain't going to leave?

788
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:06,642
They bring those leads up,
wave them under your nose,

789
00:46:06,725 --> 00:46:08,852
tomorrow they take them downtown,
parcel them out.

790
00:46:08,936 --> 00:46:11,688
A guy wants those leads,
he's gonna have to get them tonight.

791
00:46:11,772 --> 00:46:14,733
Tonight is the thing.
Talk about a chance.

792
00:46:14,775 --> 00:46:16,527
It's when a chance
presents itself.

793
00:46:16,568 --> 00:46:18,195
You got to go
in there tonight.

794
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:19,655
- You.
- I'm sorry?

795
00:46:19,696 --> 00:46:21,365
- You.
- Me?

796
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:23,492
You have to go in.
You have to get the leads.

797
00:46:23,575 --> 00:46:26,078
- I do?
- It's not something for nothing.

798
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:29,873
I took you in on this.
You have to go. It's your thing.

799
00:46:29,957 --> 00:46:32,125
I've made a deal with Graff.
I can't go in.

800
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:35,462
I've spoken out on this too much.
I've got a big mouth.

801
00:46:35,546 --> 00:46:38,549
"The fucking leads," et cetera,
"the tight-ass company," blah, blah.

802
00:46:38,632 --> 00:46:41,593
- They'll know when you go to Graff.
- What will they know?

803
00:46:41,635 --> 00:46:43,887
That I stole the leads?
I didn't steal the leads.

804
00:46:43,971 --> 00:46:46,723
I'm gonna go to the movies.
Then I'm gonna have a late drink

805
00:46:46,807 --> 00:46:48,976
- at the Como Inn with a friend.
- Dave.

806
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:50,352
Yes?

807
00:46:50,435 --> 00:46:52,521
You want me to break into the office
tonight and steal the leads?

808
00:46:52,604 --> 00:46:53,856
- Yes.
- No.

809
00:46:53,939 --> 00:46:55,524
- Oh, yes, George.
- What does that mean?

810
00:46:55,607 --> 00:47:00,028
Listen to this. I have an alibi.
I'm going to the Como Inn.

811
00:47:00,112 --> 00:47:02,865
Why? Why?
The place gets robbed,

812
00:47:02,948 --> 00:47:05,409
they're going to come looking for me.
Why? Because I probably did it.

813
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:07,911
Let me ask you this...
are you going to turn me in?

814
00:47:07,953 --> 00:47:09,788
What if you don't get caught?

815
00:47:09,872 --> 00:47:11,373
They come to you,
are you going to turn me in?

816
00:47:11,415 --> 00:47:13,458
- Why would they come to me?
- They're going to come to everybody.

817
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:15,294
- Why would I do it?
- You wouldn't, George.

818
00:47:15,377 --> 00:47:17,379
That's why I'm talking to you now.
They come to you,

819
00:47:17,462 --> 00:47:19,256
- are you going to turn me in?
- No.

820
00:47:19,298 --> 00:47:20,966
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

821
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:26,054
Uh-huh. George...
when they come to me,

822
00:47:26,138 --> 00:47:28,765
if I have to go in there,
and if I get caught...

823
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:31,685
- they come to me...
- You don't have to go in.

824
00:47:31,768 --> 00:47:33,604
I have to go in, see?
That's something I have to do.

825
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:35,772
- Why?
- Why?

826
00:47:35,814 --> 00:47:37,441
Are you going to give me $7,500?

827
00:47:37,483 --> 00:47:39,735
75? I thought we were
splitting five grand.

828
00:47:39,818 --> 00:47:42,779
I lied, all right? Your end is 25,
my end is my own concern.

829
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:45,824
Now, stick with me here.
If they come to me,

830
00:47:45,908 --> 00:47:48,577
I'm caught, they're going to ask me
who were accomplices.

831
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,287
- Me.
- Absolutely.

832
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:51,663
That's ridiculous.

833
00:47:51,705 --> 00:47:53,582
To the law, you're
an accessory before the fact.

834
00:47:53,624 --> 00:47:56,543
- I didn't ask to be.
- Tough luck, because you are.

835
00:47:56,627 --> 00:47:59,254
- Because you told me about it?
- That's right.

836
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:01,840
Why are you doing this
to me, Dave?

837
00:48:01,924 --> 00:48:04,551
Why are you talking this way to me?
I don't understand.

838
00:48:04,635 --> 00:48:07,846
- Why are you doing this at all?
- None of your fucking business.

839
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:09,806
Just in or out?
You tell me.

840
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:11,433
You're out,
you take the consequences.

841
00:48:11,517 --> 00:48:13,435
- I do?
- That's right.

842
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:15,479
- And why is that?
- Because you listened.

843
00:48:16,146 --> 00:48:17,564
Well, when will
Mrs. Nyborg be back?

844
00:48:17,648 --> 00:48:20,234
You know, I hate to keep
calling you this late, Bruce,

845
00:48:20,317 --> 00:48:24,446
but I feel a responsibility,
I must say. When you have...

846
00:48:26,114 --> 00:48:29,576
You know, they say,
"You don't buy it, you rent it."

847
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,954
- Huh?
- The thing.

848
00:48:32,037 --> 00:48:36,959
You really...
what do you keep?

849
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,795
I mean, you don't keep
anything, really.

850
00:48:39,878 --> 00:48:42,631
- No.
- Security.

851
00:48:42,714 --> 00:48:45,300
Things. Things.

852
00:48:45,384 --> 00:48:47,761
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.

853
00:48:47,845 --> 00:48:52,432
It's just... you try
to stave off insecurity.

854
00:48:52,516 --> 00:48:53,934
You can't do it.

855
00:48:54,351 --> 00:48:56,436
- No.
- No. That's what I'm telling you.

856
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:01,817
Stocks, bonds, objects of art,
real estate, what are they?

857
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:05,362
An opportunity.
To what? To make money?

858
00:49:05,404 --> 00:49:09,366
Perhaps. To lose money?
Perhaps.

859
00:49:09,408 --> 00:49:12,911
To indulge and to learn
about ourselves? Perhaps.

860
00:49:12,995 --> 00:49:16,081
So fucking what?
What is it? They're an opportunity.

861
00:49:16,165 --> 00:49:19,084
That's all they are.
They're an event.

862
00:49:19,168 --> 00:49:22,838
A guy comes to you,
you make a call. You send in a card,

863
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,674
I have these properties
I would like for you to see.

864
00:49:25,716 --> 00:49:28,760
What does this mean?
What do you want it to mean?

865
00:49:28,844 --> 00:49:30,971
You see what I'm saying?

866
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,018
Things happen to you.

867
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:39,897
Glad I met you.

868
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,690
I'm glad I met you,
James.

869
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:46,445
I want to show you
something.

870
00:49:46,528 --> 00:49:49,031
It may mean something to you,
it may not.

871
00:49:49,114 --> 00:49:51,950
I don't know.
I don't know anymore.

872
00:49:54,745 --> 00:49:57,789
What is that?
Florida.

873
00:49:57,873 --> 00:50:00,709
Glengarry Highlands.
Florida.

874
00:50:00,751 --> 00:50:03,754
Bullshit.
And maybe that's true.

875
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:06,965
And that's what I said.

876
00:50:07,049 --> 00:50:09,551
But look at this.

877
00:50:09,635 --> 00:50:14,056
What is this?
This is a piece of land.

878
00:50:14,097 --> 00:50:16,558
Listen to what I'm going
to tell you now.

879
00:50:44,628 --> 00:50:46,713
- What happened?
- Where do you work?

880
00:50:46,797 --> 00:50:49,383
I work, yes.
I work here.

881
00:50:49,466 --> 00:50:51,927
- What is it? What happened?
- Robbery.

882
00:50:58,308 --> 00:51:02,396
Williamson. Williamson,
did they get the contracts?

883
00:51:05,107 --> 00:51:07,484
All right, tell me.
Now. Tell me.

884
00:51:07,568 --> 00:51:09,403
- They stole the contracts?
- Excuse me, sir.

885
00:51:09,444 --> 00:51:10,863
- Did they get my contract?
- Excuse me, fella.

886
00:51:10,946 --> 00:51:12,156
- Did they?
- Would you excuse us?

887
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:14,366
Don't fuck with me, fella.
I'm talking about a Cadillac car

888
00:51:14,449 --> 00:51:17,077
- that you owe me.
- They didn't get your contract.

889
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,496
- I filed it before I left.
- They didn't get my contracts?

890
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,498
They got... excuse me.

891
00:51:21,582 --> 00:51:23,584
Fuck.

892
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:26,420
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Williamson!

893
00:51:26,503 --> 00:51:29,464
- Williamson, open the fucking door.
- Who are you?

894
00:51:29,464 --> 00:51:31,633
- They didn't get the contracts.
- Did they?

895
00:51:31,717 --> 00:51:34,261
They got... listen to me.
They got some of them.

896
00:51:34,344 --> 00:51:36,972
- Some of them?
- Who told you?

897
00:51:37,055 --> 00:51:40,392
Who told me?
Who told me we had a robbery?

898
00:51:40,475 --> 00:51:42,144
We got a fucking board
up on the window.

899
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:46,648
Who is this? Yes.
Yes, I confess. I did it.

900
00:51:46,732 --> 00:51:49,026
Now, leave me
a second here, please.

901
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:51,778
- Okay, now, talk to me.
- I'm still trying to sort it out.

902
00:51:51,862 --> 00:51:53,989
- So far...
- Talk to me. Talk to me.

903
00:51:54,072 --> 00:51:57,326
They got some
of the contracts?

904
00:51:57,409 --> 00:52:00,621
Lingk. James Lingk,
which I closed last night.

905
00:52:00,704 --> 00:52:02,331
- You closed it last night?
- Yes.

906
00:52:02,414 --> 00:52:06,084
- I filed it. It went down.
- You filed it?

907
00:52:06,168 --> 00:52:08,504
- James Lingk?
- Yes.

908
00:52:08,587 --> 00:52:10,506
- It was sent downtown?
- Yes, all right?

909
00:52:10,547 --> 00:52:12,508
I filed it last night.
It went to the bank.

910
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:14,927
- It went downtown, all right?
- You filed it?

911
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:17,638
Then I'm over the fucking top,
you owe me a Cadillac.

912
00:52:17,721 --> 00:52:19,932
- I don't...
- I don't want to hear any shit.

913
00:52:20,015 --> 00:52:22,976
I don't give a shit.
Lingk puts me over the top.

914
00:52:23,018 --> 00:52:26,021
You filed it. It went downtown.
Now you owe me the car.

915
00:52:26,104 --> 00:52:29,066
- The robbery makes difficult...
- Fuck you! You owe me the car!

916
00:52:29,149 --> 00:52:31,777
See, 'cause this is how
we keep score, "bubby".

917
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,988
You told me, "Close thus,
and so you get the car."

918
00:52:35,072 --> 00:52:38,075
- I got it.
- Would you excuse us, please?

919
00:52:38,158 --> 00:52:41,078
You hear what I said?
Do you hear what I said?

920
00:52:41,161 --> 00:52:44,665
Hey, pal!
Your excuses are your own!

921
00:52:55,425 --> 00:52:57,970
"Recontact James Lingk.

922
00:52:58,053 --> 00:53:01,849
6:00 p.m. Morton Grove."
Ah-ha.

923
00:53:01,932 --> 00:53:04,434
When do you expect
her in?

924
00:53:04,518 --> 00:53:07,229
This is Ricky Roma
from last night.

925
00:53:07,312 --> 00:53:10,399
She'll remember.
Just, just... wait a minute!

926
00:53:10,482 --> 00:53:13,819
Just to say... to thank her
for a wonderful time.

927
00:53:13,902 --> 00:53:16,363
Thank you.
I'll call back later. Thank you.

928
00:53:16,405 --> 00:53:18,824
They should check
if we're insured.

929
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,829
Uh-huh.

930
00:53:23,912 --> 00:53:26,832
"10:00 p.m., Octavia."

931
00:53:26,915 --> 00:53:29,918
Please don't leave.
I'm going to talk to you.

932
00:53:30,002 --> 00:53:32,880
- What's your name?
- Are you talking to me?

933
00:53:32,921 --> 00:53:35,924
- That's right.
- My name is Richard Roma.

934
00:53:47,769 --> 00:53:50,397
I... you know,
they should be insured.

935
00:53:50,481 --> 00:53:52,941
- What do you care?
- Then they wouldn't be so upset.

936
00:53:53,025 --> 00:53:55,527
- Huh?
- They wouldn't be so upset.

937
00:53:55,611 --> 00:53:58,238
- Mitch and Murray.
- Yeah, you're right.

938
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,115
That's right.
How are you?

939
00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:02,409
I'm fine.

940
00:54:02,493 --> 00:54:04,953
You mean the board?
You mean on the board?

941
00:54:06,788 --> 00:54:09,958
Yes. Okay.
The board.

942
00:54:10,042 --> 00:54:12,544
I'm fucked on the board.
I can't...

943
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:17,424
My mind must be other places,
'cause I can't...

944
00:54:17,508 --> 00:54:19,927
What?
You can't do what?

945
00:54:19,968 --> 00:54:22,763
- I can't close them.
- Well, they're old.

946
00:54:22,846 --> 00:54:26,517
Look, look at this shit
they're giving you. Huh?

947
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,811
- Yes, they are old.
- They're ancient.

948
00:54:28,894 --> 00:54:31,355
"Clear Meadows."
This shit's dead.

949
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:32,773
- It is dead.
- Waste of time.

950
00:54:32,856 --> 00:54:37,319
- Yes. I'm no fucking good.
- Hey, fuck that shit, George.

951
00:54:37,402 --> 00:54:39,655
You had a bad month.
You're a good man.

952
00:54:39,738 --> 00:54:41,490
- I am?
- Yeah, you had a bad streak.

953
00:54:41,573 --> 00:54:45,327
Look at this. 15 units, Mountain View,
the fucking things get stolen.

954
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:49,039
- He said he filed...
- He filed the big one.

955
00:54:49,122 --> 00:54:51,291
He filed the guy from the bar
that I closed last night.

956
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:53,836
All the little ones,
I got to go back.

957
00:54:56,129 --> 00:54:58,841
Can you believe this?
I got to go back and close again.

958
00:54:58,924 --> 00:55:01,510
I mean, talk about
a fucking beat

959
00:55:01,593 --> 00:55:05,180
that would sap anyone's... wait,
wait, wait. Where are the phones?

960
00:55:05,264 --> 00:55:08,100
- They stole...
- They stole...?

961
00:55:08,183 --> 00:55:10,686
- What kind of an outfit is it...
- They stole the phones.

962
00:55:10,769 --> 00:55:13,522
...when criminals come and they take...
they steal the phones?

963
00:55:13,605 --> 00:55:15,816
They stole the leads.
They stole the phones,

964
00:55:15,858 --> 00:55:18,485
they stole... aw, Christ.

965
00:55:18,569 --> 00:55:22,823
What am I going
to do this month? Shit.

966
00:55:22,865 --> 00:55:24,867
You think they're going to catch...
where are you going?

967
00:55:24,908 --> 00:55:27,077
Down the street.

968
00:55:28,537 --> 00:55:33,083
- Where are you going?
- To the... what do you fucking care?

969
00:55:33,167 --> 00:55:37,588
- Aren't you going out today?
- With what, John? With what?

970
00:55:37,671 --> 00:55:40,841
Well, answer me.
They stole the Glengarry leads.

971
00:55:40,924 --> 00:55:44,386
- They stole Rio Rancho.
- I have stuff from last year's file.

972
00:55:44,469 --> 00:55:47,681
Oh, oh, oh.
Your "nostalgia" file.

973
00:55:47,764 --> 00:55:50,517
Oh, great. That's great,
'cause I don't...

974
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,811
- Do you want to go out today?
- I don't have to eat this month.

975
00:55:52,895 --> 00:55:55,481
Great.
Give them to me.

976
00:55:55,564 --> 00:55:58,984
Bring them.
Come on.

977
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,989
Fucking Mitch and Murray
are going to shit a...

978
00:56:04,031 --> 00:56:07,201
What am I going
to do all month?

979
00:56:07,284 --> 00:56:09,578
See, the thing
of it is,

980
00:56:09,661 --> 00:56:12,122
is were the leads insured?
You think?

981
00:56:12,206 --> 00:56:15,125
- What?
- Were the leads insured?

982
00:56:15,209 --> 00:56:17,544
I don't know, why?

983
00:56:17,628 --> 00:56:19,505
'Cause if they weren't,
I know Mitch and Murray...

984
00:56:19,588 --> 00:56:21,965
- What?
- They'll be upset.

985
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:24,510
That's right.

986
00:56:24,593 --> 00:56:26,803
You're right.

987
00:56:28,055 --> 00:56:30,557
He said we're all going
to have to talk to the guy.

988
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:32,184
- To...
- The cop.

989
00:56:32,267 --> 00:56:34,311
Great. We have to talk
to the cop.

990
00:56:34,394 --> 00:56:38,065
- Another waste of time.
- A waste of time? Why?

991
00:56:38,148 --> 00:56:40,067
Why? 'Cause they're not going
to find the guy.

992
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:44,071
- The cops?
- Yes, the cops. No.

993
00:56:44,112 --> 00:56:45,781
The cops aren't going
to find the guy?

994
00:56:45,864 --> 00:56:47,616
- Nope.
- Why do you think so?

995
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:49,201
Why? Because they are stupid.
Where were you last night?

996
00:56:51,453 --> 00:56:53,789
- Where were you?
- Where was I?

997
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:54,915
- Yeah.
- I was at home.

998
00:56:54,957 --> 00:56:56,083
- Where were you?
- At home.

999
00:56:56,124 --> 00:56:58,001
See? Were you the guy
who broke in?

1000
00:56:58,085 --> 00:56:59,127
- Was I?
- Yes.

1001
00:56:59,211 --> 00:57:01,421
- No.
- Then don't sweat it. You know why?

1002
00:57:01,463 --> 00:57:03,590
- No.
- You have nothing to hide.

1003
00:57:03,674 --> 00:57:06,385
- When I talk to police, I get nervous.
- Yes, you know who doesn't?

1004
00:57:06,468 --> 00:57:08,804
- No. Who?
- Thieves.

1005
00:57:08,804 --> 00:57:10,764
I don't know
what I'm going to tell them.

1006
00:57:10,806 --> 00:57:13,141
The truth.
Always tell them the truth.

1007
00:57:13,183 --> 00:57:15,227
It's the easiest thing
to remember.

1008
00:57:15,811 --> 00:57:18,814
Whoa, whoa!
"Patel"?

1009
00:57:18,897 --> 00:57:21,358
"Ravidam Patel"?

1010
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:23,235
How am I going to make a living
on these deadbeats?

1011
00:57:23,318 --> 00:57:25,279
- Where did you get this from, a morgue?
- Look, I'm...

1012
00:57:25,362 --> 00:57:28,490
Come on. What's the point?
What's the fucking point?

1013
00:57:28,574 --> 00:57:31,451
I got to argue with you,
I got to knock heads with the cops,

1014
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:33,328
I'm busting my balls
to sell your dirt

1015
00:57:33,412 --> 00:57:36,206
to deadbeats...
money in the mattress.

1016
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:38,792
I come back, you can't even
keep the contracts safe.

1017
00:57:38,876 --> 00:57:41,044
I got to go out...
fuck this shit.

1018
00:57:41,128 --> 00:57:42,921
I'm going to go out
and re-close last week's stuff.

1019
00:57:43,005 --> 00:57:45,048
No, the word from Murray
is leave them alone.

1020
00:57:45,132 --> 00:57:47,342
If he needs a new sig,
he'll go out himself.

1021
00:57:47,384 --> 00:57:50,387
- Murray's gonna go out?
- He'll be "president of the company

1022
00:57:50,429 --> 00:57:52,764
just in from out of town,"
all right?

1023
00:57:54,308 --> 00:57:57,311
Okay, okay, okay.
Give me this shit.

1024
00:57:57,394 --> 00:57:59,855
- I'm giving you three leads.
- Three? I count two.

1025
00:57:59,897 --> 00:58:02,107
- There's three leads there.
- Patel? Fuck you.

1026
00:58:02,191 --> 00:58:05,194
Fucking Shiva handed
this guy a million dollars,

1027
00:58:05,277 --> 00:58:07,488
told him, "Sign the deal,"
he wouldn't sign.

1028
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:10,324
And the god Vishnu, too,
into the bargain. Fuck you.

1029
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:13,243
You know your business, I know mine.
Your business is being an asshole.

1030
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:15,913
If I find out whose fucking cousin
you are, I'm gonna go to him

1031
00:58:15,996 --> 00:58:20,209
and figure out a way
to have your ass... fuck you!

1032
00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:22,920
I'm waiting
for the new leads.

1033
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:29,718
Get the chalk!
Hey! Get the chalk!

1034
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,637
Get the...
I did it... I closed 'em.

1035
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,472
I closed the cocksucker.
Get the chalk.

1036
00:58:33,555 --> 00:58:37,059
Put me on the board, John.
Put me on the Cadillac board!

1037
00:58:37,142 --> 00:58:39,853
Williamson,
pick up the fucking chalk.

1038
00:58:39,937 --> 00:58:43,982
- Rick... eight units, Mountain View.
- You sold eight Mountain View?

1039
00:58:44,066 --> 00:58:46,401
You bet your ass!
Who wants to go to lunch?

1040
00:58:46,443 --> 00:58:48,570
Who wants to go to lunch...
I'm buying.

1041
00:58:48,654 --> 00:58:52,366
Williamson... $82,000,
12 grand in my commission.

1042
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:54,701
On deadbeat
magazine subscription leads.

1043
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:57,412
- Who?
- Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.

1044
00:58:57,454 --> 00:58:59,873
Read it.
What the hell happened here?

1045
00:58:59,957 --> 00:59:02,084
Fuck! I had them
on River Glen.

1046
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:03,919
- What happened?
- Somebody broke in.

1047
00:59:04,002 --> 00:59:06,171
- Eight units!
- Yeah.

1048
00:59:06,255 --> 00:59:09,132
- Shelly!
- Big deal... I broke a bad streak.

1049
00:59:09,216 --> 00:59:11,426
Shelly "The Machine" Levene.
That's great.

1050
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:13,428
Thank you, George.
Hey...

1051
00:59:13,554 --> 00:59:15,973
- grab the phone, call Mitch.
- They took the phones.

1052
00:59:16,056 --> 00:59:17,641
- Huh?
- Aaronow?

1053
00:59:17,683 --> 00:59:19,977
They took the leads,
the cash, the contracts.

1054
00:59:20,018 --> 00:59:21,854
- We had a robbery.
- When?

1055
00:59:21,937 --> 00:59:24,648
- Last night, this morning.
- They took the leads?

1056
00:59:27,442 --> 00:59:29,444
Fucking asshole.

1057
00:59:29,528 --> 00:59:31,655
What? They beat you
with a rubber bat?

1058
00:59:31,738 --> 00:59:34,074
Cop couldn't find his dick
with two hands and a map.

1059
00:59:34,158 --> 00:59:36,493
Anybody who talks to this asshole
is a fucking asshole.

1060
00:59:36,577 --> 00:59:38,662
- You gonna turn state's?
- Fuck you, Ricky.

1061
00:59:38,745 --> 00:59:41,623
I ain't going out today.
I'm going home.

1062
00:59:41,707 --> 00:59:44,001
I'm going home because nothing's
accomplished here.

1063
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:46,128
- Anybody talks to this guy...
- Guess what "The Machine" did.

1064
00:59:46,211 --> 00:59:49,506
- Fuck "The Machine."
- Mountain View, eight units.

1065
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:52,676
Cop's got no right to talk to me
that way. I did not rob the place.

1066
00:59:52,759 --> 00:59:55,888
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yeah, he closed the deal.

1067
00:59:55,971 --> 00:59:58,307
Eight units,
Mountain View.

1068
00:59:58,348 --> 01:00:00,893
- You did that?
- Yeah.

1069
01:00:02,102 --> 01:00:04,229
- Fuck you.
- Guess who?

1070
01:00:04,313 --> 01:00:05,898
- When?
- Just now.

1071
01:00:05,981 --> 01:00:08,275
- Guess who?
- You just... this morning?

1072
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:10,819
Harriett
and blah blah Nyborg.

1073
01:00:10,903 --> 01:00:14,156
- You did that?
- Yeah... $82,000.

1074
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:18,785
- Those fucking deadbeats.
- My ass. I told 'em... listen to this.

1075
01:00:18,869 --> 01:00:22,039
- I don't want to hear your war stories.
- Fuck you, Dave.

1076
01:00:22,122 --> 01:00:24,541
I said, "You have to believe
in yourself."

1077
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:27,002
Give me a lead.
I'm going out. I'm getting out.

1078
01:00:27,085 --> 01:00:31,924
- Fuck the leads. I'm going home.
- "Fuck me, Bruce.

1079
01:00:32,007 --> 01:00:33,550
- You have to believe in yourself."
- We haven't got a lead.

1080
01:00:33,634 --> 01:00:36,094
- Why not?
- They took 'em.

1081
01:00:36,178 --> 01:00:38,764
They're fucking garbage, any case.
The whole goddamn...

1082
01:00:38,847 --> 01:00:42,184
"You look around, you say,
'This one has so-and-so. I got nothing.

1083
01:00:42,226 --> 01:00:44,728
But why? Why don't I get
the opportunities?"'

1084
01:00:44,812 --> 01:00:47,397
- Did they steal the contracts?
- What the fuck do you care?

1085
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:49,274
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

1086
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:51,360
Will you shut up?
I'm telling him something.

1087
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,988
Could we get
some coffee?

1088
01:00:55,072 --> 01:00:57,199
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

1089
01:00:59,201 --> 01:01:00,369
Uh-huh.

1090
01:01:00,452 --> 01:01:02,371
Anybody's going out,
I could use some coffee.

1091
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:08,210
- "You do get the opportunity."
- Fuck is that supposed to mean?

1092
01:01:08,293 --> 01:01:10,587
"You do get the opportunities.
You get 'em as I get 'em,

1093
01:01:11,088 --> 01:01:13,382
- as everybody gets 'em."
- I don't care they stole the contracts?

1094
01:01:13,465 --> 01:01:15,592
I got 'em in the kitchen,
eating their crumb cake...

1095
01:01:15,676 --> 01:01:17,886
- What does that mean?
- It means, Dave,

1096
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:20,222
You haven't closed
a good one in a month.

1097
01:01:20,264 --> 01:01:22,099
None of my business,
you want to push me to answer you.

1098
01:01:22,182 --> 01:01:25,227
So you haven't got a contract
to get stolen and so forth.

1099
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:28,147
You got a mean streak in you.
Shut the fuck up!

1100
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:31,400
Ricky, you got a mean streak in you,
and what are you babbling about?

1101
01:01:31,483 --> 01:01:33,360
You bring that shit up...
on my volume?

1102
01:01:33,443 --> 01:01:36,572
If you were on a bad one and I
brought it up to you, you'd harbor it.

1103
01:01:36,655 --> 01:01:39,116
You'd harbor it a long while
and you'd be right.

1104
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:41,577
- Who said "Fuck 'The Machine"'?
- Fuck "The Machine"?

1105
01:01:41,618 --> 01:01:44,163
Fuck "The Machine"?
Fuck "The Machine"!

1106
01:01:44,246 --> 01:01:47,583
What is this, courtesy class?
You're fucked, Rick.

1107
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:50,460
Are you fucking nuts?
You're hot, so you think

1108
01:01:50,544 --> 01:01:52,129
- you're the ruler of this place.
- Wait a minute, Dave.

1109
01:01:52,212 --> 01:01:53,922
- Shut up!
- Okay...

1110
01:01:54,006 --> 01:01:56,508
You want to decide who
should be dealt with how, is that it?

1111
01:01:56,592 --> 01:01:59,469
I come into the office today,
I get humiliated by some jag-off cop.

1112
01:01:59,553 --> 01:02:01,430
I get accused of...

1113
01:02:01,513 --> 01:02:05,184
I get shit thrown in my face because
you're top name on the board?

1114
01:02:05,267 --> 01:02:08,103
Is that what I did, Dave...
I humiliated you?

1115
01:02:08,187 --> 01:02:11,732
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- Sitting on top of the world.

1116
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:14,651
Sitting on top of the world...
everything's fucking peach fuzz.

1117
01:02:14,735 --> 01:02:17,946
I don't get a moment to spare
for some bust-out humanitarian

1118
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:19,823
- down on his luck lately?
- Fuck you!

1119
01:02:19,907 --> 01:02:21,700
Fuck you, Dave...
you know you got a big mouth.

1120
01:02:21,783 --> 01:02:24,995
You make a close, this whole place
stinks with your farts for a week...

1121
01:02:25,078 --> 01:02:29,416
how much you just ingested.
Oh, what a big man you are!

1122
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,169
"Let me buy you a pack of gum...
I'll show you how to chew it."

1123
01:02:32,252 --> 01:02:35,214
Your pal closes, and all that comes
out of your mouth is bile.

1124
01:02:35,297 --> 01:02:38,467
How fucked-up you are!

1125
01:02:38,509 --> 01:02:43,388
Who's my pal, Ricky? Hmm?
And what are you?

1126
01:02:43,472 --> 01:02:46,809
What are you, huh,
Bishop Sheen?

1127
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:48,977
What the fuck are you,
"Mr. Slick"?

1128
01:02:49,019 --> 01:02:51,647
What the fuck are you,
"Friend to the working man"?

1129
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:54,107
Big deal!
Fuck you!

1130
01:02:56,401 --> 01:02:58,654
You got the memory
of a fucking fly!

1131
01:03:00,739 --> 01:03:03,659
I never liked you,
anyway.

1132
01:03:03,742 --> 01:03:05,869
What is this,
your farewell speech?

1133
01:03:05,953 --> 01:03:08,330
- I'm going home.
- Your farewell to the troops?

1134
01:03:08,413 --> 01:03:10,249
I'm not going home.
I'm going to Wisconsin.

1135
01:03:10,332 --> 01:03:12,793
- Have a good trip.
- Aw, fuck you!

1136
01:03:13,544 --> 01:03:16,338
Fuck the lot of you!
Fuck you all!

1137
01:03:20,551 --> 01:03:22,344
You were saying?

1138
01:03:22,427 --> 01:03:25,138
Huh?

1139
01:03:25,222 --> 01:03:27,015
Come on.

1140
01:03:27,099 --> 01:03:29,351
Come on... you got 'em
in the kitchen,

1141
01:03:29,434 --> 01:03:32,062
you're in
your shirtsleeves,

1142
01:03:32,146 --> 01:03:34,439
you got
the stats spread out,

1143
01:03:34,523 --> 01:03:37,776
you can smell it.
Come on, snap out of it.

1144
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:41,196
- You're eating her crumb cake.
- Oh yeah, I'm eating her crumb cake.

1145
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,408
- How was it?
- From the store.

1146
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:47,035
- Fuck her.
- "Bruce, Harriett...

1147
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:50,956
we have to admit to ourselves
that we see that opportunity

1148
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,459
and take it... and that's it."
Now, we just sit there.

1149
01:03:54,543 --> 01:03:56,336
- I got my pen out.
- "Always Be Closing."

1150
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:58,922
God, that's what
I've been saying... the old ways.

1151
01:03:59,006 --> 01:04:02,509
Convert that motherfucker,
sell him, make him sign the check.

1152
01:04:02,593 --> 01:04:04,469
They got their money
in government bonds...

1153
01:04:04,553 --> 01:04:08,140
I said, "Fuck it... let's go
all the way, the whole route."

1154
01:04:08,223 --> 01:04:12,519
I take it and plat it out... eight units,
82 grand, and I say to them,

1155
01:04:12,561 --> 01:04:17,691
"This is now. This is that thing
that you have been dreaming of.

1156
01:04:17,733 --> 01:04:20,235
You are going to find
the suitcase on the train.

1157
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:23,530
The man walks in the room,
that bag is filled with money.

1158
01:04:23,655 --> 01:04:27,201
Harriett, this is it, and Bruce...
I don't want to fuck around with you.

1159
01:04:27,284 --> 01:04:30,454
No, I don't. I don't want
to pussyfoot around.

1160
01:04:30,537 --> 01:04:33,749
You think you got to look back
on this thing? I do, too.

1161
01:04:33,832 --> 01:04:37,294
Now, I'm here to do good
for you and me... the both of us.

1162
01:04:37,336 --> 01:04:40,631
What is the point
of some interim position?

1163
01:04:40,714 --> 01:04:44,301
The only arrangement
I will accept is full investment.

1164
01:04:44,384 --> 01:04:47,429
And I mean it, that's it...
all eight units. Period."

1165
01:04:47,513 --> 01:04:50,098
Now I got the pen
in my hand, Rick... hey.

1166
01:04:50,182 --> 01:04:55,020
I turned that contract around...
that's eight units, 82 grand...

1167
01:04:55,103 --> 01:04:59,149
and I said,
"I want you to sign."

1168
01:04:59,233 --> 01:05:02,236
I sat there five minutes.

1169
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:07,741
Then I sat 22 minutes
by that kitchen clock on the wall.

1170
01:05:07,825 --> 01:05:10,619
Ricky... not a word,
not a motion.

1171
01:05:10,661 --> 01:05:13,330
And what am I thinking?
"Is my arm getting tired?"

1172
01:05:13,413 --> 01:05:16,250
No. I did it.
Just like the old days,

1173
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:17,960
like I used to,
like I was taught.

1174
01:05:18,001 --> 01:05:20,128
- I did it.
- Like you taught me.

1175
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:23,257
Nobody ever...
well, if I did, I'm glad.

1176
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:25,384
No, what I did...
I locked on 'em.

1177
01:05:25,467 --> 01:05:28,095
I locked all on them...
nothing on me... on them.

1178
01:05:28,178 --> 01:05:31,265
And, oh God, I am holding
my last thought,

1179
01:05:31,348 --> 01:05:33,976
"Now is the time."

1180
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:38,647
They signed.
It was great.

1181
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:41,441
It was so fucking great.

1182
01:05:41,525 --> 01:05:45,404
It was like
they wilted all at once.

1183
01:05:45,487 --> 01:05:48,073
- Mmm.
- No gesture, nothing... just together.

1184
01:05:48,157 --> 01:05:53,245
Honest to God, they both
imperceptibly slumped.

1185
01:05:53,328 --> 01:05:56,957
And then he reached
and he took the pen and he signed,

1186
01:05:56,999 --> 01:05:59,126
passed it to her
and she signed.

1187
01:05:59,209 --> 01:06:01,461
It was solemn...
fucking solemn.

1188
01:06:01,545 --> 01:06:06,550
I let it sit, and then I nodded.
I said, "Harriett, Bruce,"

1189
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:09,052
then I pointed into the living room
to the sideboard.

1190
01:06:09,136 --> 01:06:11,346
I didn't know there was
a sideboard in there.

1191
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:13,432
He went over,
he brought us back a drink...

1192
01:06:13,515 --> 01:06:16,977
little shot glasses
with a pretty design in 'em.

1193
01:06:18,604 --> 01:06:22,232
And we just toasted
in silence.

1194
01:06:22,316 --> 01:06:25,777
Great sale, Shelly.

1195
01:06:25,861 --> 01:06:27,863
Great.

1196
01:06:27,946 --> 01:06:30,866
Fuck! Send me out!
Give me leads!

1197
01:06:30,949 --> 01:06:31,950
- Williamson! Send me out!
- Whoa!

1198
01:06:32,701 --> 01:06:34,661
- The leads are coming.
- Get 'em to me.

1199
01:06:34,745 --> 01:06:37,372
I talked to Mitch and Murray
an hour ago. They're coming in.

1200
01:06:37,456 --> 01:06:40,083
- They're a bit upset over this.
- Did you tell 'em my sale?

1201
01:06:40,167 --> 01:06:42,544
How could I tell 'em your sale?
I didn't have a tele...

1202
01:06:42,836 --> 01:06:45,172
I'll tell 'em your sale
when they bring in the leads.

1203
01:06:45,255 --> 01:06:48,175
We had a little... you closed the deal,
you made a good sale. Fine.

1204
01:06:48,258 --> 01:06:51,136
- Better than a good sale.
- I have a lot of things on my mind.

1205
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:54,389
They're coming and they're very upset.
I'm trying to make...

1206
01:06:54,515 --> 01:06:57,267
All I'm telling you is, you can tell
them it was a remarkably good sale.

1207
01:06:57,351 --> 01:07:00,103
The only thing remarkable
about it is who you made it to.

1208
01:07:00,145 --> 01:07:03,607
- What the fuck does that mean?
- If the sale sticks it'll be a miracle.

1209
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:05,984
"If the sale sticks"?
Why shouldn't the sale stick?

1210
01:07:06,068 --> 01:07:10,072
Oh, fuck you!
You do not know your job.

1211
01:07:10,155 --> 01:07:11,990
Do you know that?
A man is his job!

1212
01:07:12,074 --> 01:07:15,077
You are fucked at yours.
You hear what I'm saying to you?

1213
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,246
Your "End of the Month"
fucking boar...

1214
01:07:17,329 --> 01:07:19,122
you do not know how
to run this office.

1215
01:07:19,164 --> 01:07:21,583
You haven't got the sense.
You haven't got the balls.

1216
01:07:21,667 --> 01:07:24,795
Have you ever been on a sit?
Has this cocksucker been on a sit?

1217
01:07:24,878 --> 01:07:27,631
- Did you ever sit...
- If I were you, I would calm down.

1218
01:07:27,673 --> 01:07:29,633
Would you?
What are you gonna do, fire me?

1219
01:07:29,716 --> 01:07:31,635
Oh, oh, Rick, ooh.

1220
01:07:31,677 --> 01:07:34,972
- It's not impossible.
- Really? On an $80,000 day?

1221
01:07:35,013 --> 01:07:37,474
- It's not even noon yet.
- You closed 'em today?

1222
01:07:37,558 --> 01:07:40,227
I got up early this morning,
tracked 'em down, and closed it.

1223
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:43,605
What I'm saying to you
is that things change.

1224
01:07:43,689 --> 01:07:46,984
That's where you fuck up.
You don't know. You can't look back.

1225
01:07:47,067 --> 01:07:51,113
You don't see who's coming.
Maybe it's someone new, huh?

1226
01:07:51,196 --> 01:07:53,365
Maybe it's someone else,
but you don't know...

1227
01:07:53,448 --> 01:07:56,118
you can't look back, because
you don't know your history!

1228
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,537
When we were on Rio Rancho,
who was the top man, huh?

1229
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:00,539
For what,
two months, three months?

1230
01:08:00,622 --> 01:08:03,584
How about eight months,
for three years in a row!

1231
01:08:03,667 --> 01:08:07,421
Luck... was that it, John?
Or purloined fucking leads?

1232
01:08:07,504 --> 01:08:09,298
- It was talent!
- Yes.

1233
01:08:09,381 --> 01:08:12,926
Door to door.
It's called "cold calling," John.

1234
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:16,388
Shit, I don't even know their name.
They don't want to buy what I've got.

1235
01:08:16,472 --> 01:08:19,141
Soft sell... we were doing it
before we had a name for it.

1236
01:08:19,224 --> 01:08:21,101
- Am I right?
- You're right, you're right.

1237
01:08:21,185 --> 01:08:25,022
You wouldn't know, you cock...
he doesn't even know what a streak is.

1238
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:27,483
What the hell are you?

1239
01:08:27,524 --> 01:08:30,277
You're a fucking secretary.
Fuck you!

1240
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:33,739
That's my message to you...
fuck you, and kiss my ass.

1241
01:08:33,822 --> 01:08:37,576
If you don't like that, I go across
the street and speak to Jerry Graff.

1242
01:08:37,659 --> 01:08:39,495
Period. Fuck you.

1243
01:08:39,578 --> 01:08:42,748
Listen to me... you put me
on that fucking board,

1244
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:45,292
and I want three
promising leads for today,

1245
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:48,378
I don't want any bullshit,
and I want 'em close together,

1246
01:08:48,462 --> 01:08:50,631
because I am
going to close them all.

1247
01:08:50,714 --> 01:08:53,926
And that's all I have
to say to you.

1248
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:58,305
He's right, Williamson.

1249
01:09:00,891 --> 01:09:04,186
I'm sorry, but it's wrong,
and you know whose fault it is?

1250
01:09:04,228 --> 01:09:05,813
Mitch and Murray.

1251
01:09:08,398 --> 01:09:11,151
To hell with him.
Let's get some lunch, huh, Rick?

1252
01:09:11,235 --> 01:09:13,362
The leads won't be
up here till later anyway.

1253
01:09:13,445 --> 01:09:16,824
You're a client. I just sold you
five waterfront Glengarry Farms.

1254
01:09:16,907 --> 01:09:19,701
I do this with my hair,
throw me the cue "Kenilworth".

1255
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:22,204
- Which is it?
- Kenilworth.

1256
01:09:22,246 --> 01:09:24,957
I own the property.
My mother owns the property.

1257
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,792
I put her into it.

1258
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:30,087
You look on the plats
when you go home. You'll see...

1259
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:32,923
A-3 through 10,
26 through 30.

1260
01:09:32,965 --> 01:09:36,718
- Take your time. If you still feel...
- I won't need more time, Rick.

1261
01:09:36,802 --> 01:09:38,887
- I've bought a lot of property.
- I've got to talk to you.

1262
01:09:38,971 --> 01:09:41,348
Jim, what are you
doing here?

1263
01:09:41,431 --> 01:09:44,643
Jim Lingk,
D. Ray Morton.

1264
01:09:44,726 --> 01:09:47,771
- I'm glad to meet you.
- I put Jim into Black Creek.

1265
01:09:47,855 --> 01:09:50,732
- Are you acquainted with...
- Black Creek? No.

1266
01:09:50,816 --> 01:09:52,609
- Ooh, in Florida!
- Yes.

1267
01:09:52,693 --> 01:09:55,863
- I meant to speak to you about that.
- We'll do that this weekend.

1268
01:09:55,946 --> 01:09:57,656
My wife suggested
I look into it.

1269
01:09:57,739 --> 01:10:00,492
Beautiful rolling land...
I was telling Jim and Jinny.

1270
01:10:00,576 --> 01:10:03,954
Ray, I got to tell you something.
You eat in a lot of restaurants?

1271
01:10:04,037 --> 01:10:06,915
I know you do.
Ray is with American Express.

1272
01:10:06,957 --> 01:10:08,834
- Can I tell Jim what you do?
- Sure.

1273
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:12,379
Ray is the director of all
European sales and services...

1274
01:10:12,462 --> 01:10:15,507
what I'm saying is, you haven't had
a meal until you've tasted...

1275
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:17,384
I was at the Lingks'...

1276
01:10:17,467 --> 01:10:19,928
what was that service feature
you were talking about?

1277
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:21,680
- Which...
- "Home cooking."

1278
01:10:21,763 --> 01:10:24,600
- You had a tag phrase you used?
- "Cooking"...

1279
01:10:24,641 --> 01:10:26,268
"Home cook..."
the monthly interview.

1280
01:10:26,351 --> 01:10:28,520
- The magazine!
- Yes.

1281
01:10:28,604 --> 01:10:30,939
Is that something
I can talk about?

1282
01:10:31,023 --> 01:10:34,234
It won't be out until
the February issue, but go ahead.

1283
01:10:34,318 --> 01:10:35,944
- Are you sure?
- Go ahead.

1284
01:10:36,028 --> 01:10:39,072
Ray was eating at one of his
company men's homes in France.

1285
01:10:39,156 --> 01:10:41,200
- The man is French?
- No, but his wife is.

1286
01:10:41,283 --> 01:10:42,910
His wife.

1287
01:10:42,993 --> 01:10:45,579
Ray, what time
do you have?

1288
01:10:45,662 --> 01:10:48,457
- 12:15.
- I got to get you on the plane.

1289
01:10:48,499 --> 01:10:50,292
- Didn't I say the 2:00?
- No, the 1:00.

1290
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:53,295
Remember the 1:00... that's why
we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.

1291
01:10:53,378 --> 01:10:55,506
You're right, the 1:00...
let's scoot.

1292
01:10:55,589 --> 01:10:57,716
- A pleasure.
- I got to talk to you.

1293
01:10:57,799 --> 01:11:00,886
I got to run Ray to the airport.
Let's hustle... John!

1294
01:11:00,969 --> 01:11:04,473
Get on the phone to Pittsburgh,
American Express there, for Mr. Morton.

1295
01:11:04,556 --> 01:11:07,851
Tell them he's on the 1:00.
I'll see you.

1296
01:11:07,935 --> 01:11:10,312
Christ, I'm sorry
you came all the way in.

1297
01:11:10,395 --> 01:11:13,440
I'm running Ray to the airport.
You wait here and...

1298
01:11:13,524 --> 01:11:16,109
no, I can't. I'm meeting your man
at the bank.

1299
01:11:16,193 --> 01:11:20,030
I wish you'd have phoned!
Are you and Jinny going to be home?

1300
01:11:20,113 --> 01:11:21,532
- I don't know.
- Rick?

1301
01:11:21,615 --> 01:11:23,116
- What?
- Kenilworth?

1302
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,910
- I'm sorry?
- Kenilworth.

1303
01:11:24,993 --> 01:11:27,913
Oh, God. Excuse me, Ray...
just a minute.

1304
01:11:27,955 --> 01:11:32,501
Jim, I told you who he is... the senior
vice-president of American Express.

1305
01:11:32,584 --> 01:11:34,753
His family owns 32 per...

1306
01:11:34,837 --> 01:11:38,715
over the past years, I have sold him...
I can't tell you the dollar amount...

1307
01:11:38,757 --> 01:11:41,426
but quite a lot of land.

1308
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:44,972
I promised him five weeks ago that I
would go to the wife's birthday party

1309
01:11:45,055 --> 01:11:47,558
in Kenilworth tonight.
I have to go, you understand?

1310
01:11:47,641 --> 01:11:50,727
They treat me like a member
of the family. I have to go.

1311
01:11:50,811 --> 01:11:55,023
It's funny... you get a picture
of the corporation-type company man,

1312
01:11:55,107 --> 01:11:57,568
all business...
this guy, I'll tell you.

1313
01:11:57,609 --> 01:11:59,611
We'll go to his house
someday.

1314
01:11:59,611 --> 01:12:03,824
Let me see. Tomorrow.
I'm in L.A.?

1315
01:12:03,907 --> 01:12:06,201
Ah, Monday.

1316
01:12:06,326 --> 01:12:08,662
I'll take you to lunch.
Where would you like to eat?

1317
01:12:08,745 --> 01:12:10,164
- My wife...
- Rick?

1318
01:12:10,247 --> 01:12:13,542
I can't talk now, Jim...
I'll call you tonight. Coming, Ray.

1319
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:15,919
My wife said I have
to cancel the deal.

1320
01:12:17,629 --> 01:12:20,174
That's a common reaction, Jim,
and let me tell you what it is.

1321
01:12:20,257 --> 01:12:23,135
That's why you married her.
One of the reasons is prudence.

1322
01:12:23,177 --> 01:12:25,971
No, it's a sizable investment.
One thinks twice.

1323
01:12:26,013 --> 01:12:30,976
It's also something women have.
Reaction to the size of the investment.

1324
01:12:31,518 --> 01:12:33,312
Monday, you invite me
to dinner again...

1325
01:12:33,353 --> 01:12:35,272
- This woman can cook.
- I'm sure she can.

1326
01:12:35,355 --> 01:12:38,025
We are going to talk.
I want to tell you something.

1327
01:12:38,108 --> 01:12:41,153
Something about your acreage
I want you to know.

1328
01:12:41,236 --> 01:12:44,990
I can't talk about it here,
I really shouldn't, and by law...

1329
01:12:45,073 --> 01:12:49,411
the man next to you...
bought his lot at 42...

1330
01:12:49,495 --> 01:12:51,497
phoned to say
he already had an offer.

1331
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:53,248
- Rick.
- I'm coming.

1332
01:12:53,332 --> 01:12:55,792
Ray, what a day.
I'll call you this evening.

1333
01:12:55,876 --> 01:12:59,171
I'm sorry you had to come
all the way in. Monday lunch.

1334
01:12:59,254 --> 01:13:00,964
- We have to go.
- Monday!

1335
01:13:01,048 --> 01:13:04,718
She called the consumer...
the attorney general?

1336
01:13:04,801 --> 01:13:07,179
- They said we have three days.
- Who'd she call?

1337
01:13:07,262 --> 01:13:10,349
The attorney ge...
it was some consumer office.

1338
01:13:11,517 --> 01:13:13,852
Why'd she do that, Jim?

1339
01:13:13,894 --> 01:13:15,729
I don't know.

1340
01:13:15,813 --> 01:13:17,648
But they said
we have three days.

1341
01:13:17,731 --> 01:13:20,818
They said
we got three days, yeah.

1342
01:13:20,901 --> 01:13:22,903
Three days?

1343
01:13:22,986 --> 01:13:27,032
- To... you know.
- No, I don't know.

1344
01:13:27,115 --> 01:13:30,661
- Tell me.
- To change our minds.

1345
01:13:30,744 --> 01:13:33,664
Of course you have...
three days.

1346
01:13:33,747 --> 01:13:36,166
So we can't talk Monday.

1347
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:38,836
Monday...
you saw my book.

1348
01:13:38,919 --> 01:13:41,505
Jim, Jim... I can't.

1349
01:13:41,588 --> 01:13:43,465
You saw my book.
I can't.

1350
01:13:43,549 --> 01:13:45,592
We have to before Monday
to get our money back.

1351
01:13:45,676 --> 01:13:47,678
Three business days,
they mean.

1352
01:13:47,761 --> 01:13:50,180
- Three business days.
- Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

1353
01:13:50,264 --> 01:13:53,517
- I don't understand.
- That's what they are, three business...

1354
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,686
if we wait till Monday,
my time limit runs out.

1355
01:13:55,769 --> 01:13:57,855
- You don't count Saturday.
- I'm not.

1356
01:13:57,938 --> 01:14:00,607
I'm saying you don't include
Saturday in the three days.

1357
01:14:00,691 --> 01:14:04,027
- It's not a business day.
- I am not counting it.

1358
01:14:04,111 --> 01:14:08,782
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday...
so it would have elapsed.

1359
01:14:08,866 --> 01:14:10,784
What would have elapsed?

1360
01:14:10,868 --> 01:14:12,619
If we wait till Monday
it would have elapsed!

1361
01:14:12,703 --> 01:14:14,955
- When did you write the check?
- Yesterday.

1362
01:14:15,038 --> 01:14:16,707
- What was yesterday?
- Tuesday.

1363
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:19,877
- And when was that check cashed?
- I don't know.

1364
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:22,337
What was the earliest
it could have been cashed?

1365
01:14:22,379 --> 01:14:25,757
- I don't know.
- Today.

1366
01:14:25,841 --> 01:14:29,052
Today. Which, in any case,
it was not...

1367
01:14:29,094 --> 01:14:32,222
there was something on the agreement
I wanted to go over with you.

1368
01:14:32,306 --> 01:14:34,308
It wasn't cashed?

1369
01:14:34,433 --> 01:14:36,602
I just phoned downtown...
it's on their desk.

1370
01:14:36,643 --> 01:14:38,812
- Rick.
- One moment.

1371
01:14:38,896 --> 01:14:41,732
One point, in fact, of which
I spoke to you of which,

1372
01:14:41,815 --> 01:14:43,817
I can't talk to you
about it here.

1373
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:46,195
- Levene!
- Listen to me.

1374
01:14:46,278 --> 01:14:50,240
The statute is for your protection.
I have no complaint with that.

1375
01:14:50,324 --> 01:14:52,576
In fact, I was a member
of the board when we drafted it.

1376
01:14:52,659 --> 01:14:54,620
So quite the opposite.
It says,

1377
01:14:54,661 --> 01:14:57,414
"You can change your mind
three 'working days'

1378
01:14:57,456 --> 01:14:59,333
from the time
the deal was closed."

1379
01:14:59,416 --> 01:15:01,376
- Levene!
- Wait a second!

1380
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:03,629
Which is not until
the check is cashed!

1381
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:07,132
I'm through with this "meshugaas".
Nobody should talk to a man that way.

1382
01:15:07,174 --> 01:15:09,468
- How are you talking to me that way?
- Levene!

1383
01:15:09,551 --> 01:15:12,471
- How can you talk to me that way?
- I'm gonna flag a cab.

1384
01:15:12,554 --> 01:15:15,474
- I didn't rob...
- Shelly, get in the office.

1385
01:15:15,516 --> 01:15:18,644
"Where were you last?"
Is anybody listening to me?

1386
01:15:18,727 --> 01:15:22,481
- Where's Moss?
- Is this Levene?

1387
01:15:22,564 --> 01:15:25,484
Perhaps I could assist you.
Excuse us, will you?

1388
01:15:25,526 --> 01:15:29,029
I work here! I didn't come in here
to be mistreated!

1389
01:15:29,112 --> 01:15:31,782
- Go to lunch, will you?
- That's why I came in to work today.

1390
01:15:31,865 --> 01:15:33,617
The leads come in,
I'll let you know.

1391
01:15:33,659 --> 01:15:35,619
- That's why I came in!
- Just go to lunch.

1392
01:15:35,661 --> 01:15:37,913
- I don't wanna go to lunch!
- Go to lunch, George.

1393
01:15:37,996 --> 01:15:39,915
Where does he get off
talking that way to a working man?

1394
01:15:39,998 --> 01:15:42,125
Take it outside. We have people
trying to do business.

1395
01:15:42,209 --> 01:15:44,336
That's what I came in here for.
That's what I'm trying to do!

1396
01:15:44,419 --> 01:15:46,922
- I meet Gestapo tactics.
- Excuse me.

1397
01:15:47,005 --> 01:15:49,049
I meet Gestapo tactics!

1398
01:15:49,132 --> 01:15:51,426
I meet Gestapo tactics.
That's not right.

1399
01:15:51,468 --> 01:15:57,266
No man has the right...
no man has the right...

1400
01:15:57,349 --> 01:16:01,436
"Call an attorney"...
that means you're under...

1401
01:16:01,478 --> 01:16:03,438
he says, "Cooperate
or we'll take you downtown."

1402
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,482
That's not...
as long as I've...

1403
01:16:05,524 --> 01:16:06,984
Will you get out of here?

1404
01:16:07,025 --> 01:16:09,820
Will you get out of here?
Will you?

1405
01:16:09,862 --> 01:16:12,823
I'm trying to run an office here.
Now, will you go to lunch?

1406
01:16:12,906 --> 01:16:17,119
Go to lunch.
Will you go to lunch?

1407
01:16:31,008 --> 01:16:33,177
- Excuse me.
- Where did Moss...?

1408
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:36,388
- Excuse me, please?
- Did he go to the restaurant?

1409
01:16:36,472 --> 01:16:38,765
Will you
excuse me, please?

1410
01:16:42,394 --> 01:16:44,938
I'm sorry, I...

1411
01:16:46,356 --> 01:16:49,693
I apologize to you. It's...

1412
01:16:49,776 --> 01:16:52,321
It's not me,
it's my wife.

1413
01:16:54,406 --> 01:16:56,200
What is it?

1414
01:16:56,241 --> 01:16:58,285
- I told you.
- Tell me again.

1415
01:16:58,368 --> 01:17:01,246
- What's going on here?
- Tell me again... your wife?

1416
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:03,499
- I told you.
- Tell me again.

1417
01:17:04,041 --> 01:17:06,126
She wants her money back.

1418
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:07,961
We're gonna speak to her.

1419
01:17:08,045 --> 01:17:10,547
No, she told me,
"Right now".

1420
01:17:10,672 --> 01:17:13,050
- We're gonna speak to her, Jim.
- She won't listen.

1421
01:17:13,091 --> 01:17:14,927
- She...
- Roma!

1422
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:18,555
She said if don't get my money back,
to call the state's attorney.

1423
01:17:18,639 --> 01:17:20,432
No. No.
This is something she said.

1424
01:17:20,474 --> 01:17:22,893
- We don't have to do that.
- She told me I have to.

1425
01:17:22,935 --> 01:17:25,103
- No, Jim.
- I do.

1426
01:17:25,187 --> 01:17:26,897
Listen, I do...
if I don't get my money back...

1427
01:17:26,939 --> 01:17:28,816
Roma,
I'm talking to you.

1428
01:17:28,899 --> 01:17:32,736
Listen... will someone
get this guy off my back, please?

1429
01:17:32,778 --> 01:17:36,031
- You have a problem?
- Yes, I have a problem!

1430
01:17:36,073 --> 01:17:37,616
Yes, I do, my friend.
It is not me

1431
01:17:37,699 --> 01:17:40,577
that ripped the joint off.
I'm doing business.

1432
01:17:40,619 --> 01:17:44,248
I will be with you
in a while, got it?

1433
01:17:44,331 --> 01:17:47,709
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

1434
01:17:50,003 --> 01:17:52,005
This is me!

1435
01:17:52,089 --> 01:17:55,843
Jim, this is
Ricky, Jim.

1436
01:17:57,219 --> 01:18:01,181
Jim, anything you want,
you want it, you got it.

1437
01:18:01,265 --> 01:18:03,725
Understand?
This is me.

1438
01:18:03,809 --> 01:18:06,270
Something upset you.

1439
01:18:06,311 --> 01:18:08,605
Yes.
Sit down now.

1440
01:18:08,689 --> 01:18:12,609
Sit down.
You tell me what it is,

1441
01:18:12,651 --> 01:18:16,029
am I gonna
help you fix it?

1442
01:18:16,113 --> 01:18:18,157
You're goddamned
right I am.

1443
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:20,742
Sit down.

1444
01:18:20,826 --> 01:18:23,412
I'll tell you something,

1445
01:18:23,495 --> 01:18:28,292
sometimes we need
someone from outside.

1446
01:18:31,253 --> 01:18:33,839
Sit. Talk to me,
come on.

1447
01:18:38,051 --> 01:18:40,721
I can't negotiate.

1448
01:18:41,513 --> 01:18:44,057
What does that mean?

1449
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:47,811
What?

1450
01:18:49,688 --> 01:18:51,773
What?
Say the words.

1451
01:18:51,857 --> 01:18:54,651
I don't have the power.

1452
01:18:54,693 --> 01:18:56,778
Okay, I said it.

1453
01:18:56,862 --> 01:19:00,282
- What power?
- To negotiate.

1454
01:19:00,365 --> 01:19:02,326
To negotiate what?

1455
01:19:04,369 --> 01:19:06,538
To negotiate what?

1456
01:19:06,622 --> 01:19:08,457
This.

1457
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:10,626
- What this?
- The deal.

1458
01:19:10,709 --> 01:19:12,586
The deal?

1459
01:19:12,669 --> 01:19:14,630
Forget the deal, Jim.

1460
01:19:14,713 --> 01:19:17,674
You got something on your mind,
what is it?

1461
01:19:17,758 --> 01:19:20,427
What?

1462
01:19:22,721 --> 01:19:25,057
I can't talk to you.

1463
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:27,559
You met my wife.

1464
01:19:27,643 --> 01:19:30,562
- What?
- Aw...

1465
01:19:32,773 --> 01:19:34,900
I met your wife,
what?

1466
01:19:39,029 --> 01:19:41,323
What, Jim?

1467
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:45,828
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, let's go.

1468
01:19:45,869 --> 01:19:47,120
Get a drink,
come on.

1469
01:19:47,162 --> 01:19:49,373
No, no, she told me
not to talk to you.

1470
01:19:49,456 --> 01:19:51,333
Come on, we're gonna
go around the corner.

1471
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:52,960
We'll have a drink.
Who's gonna know?

1472
01:19:53,043 --> 01:19:55,045
She told me to get
the check back, otherwise...

1473
01:19:55,128 --> 01:19:57,172
Forget the deal, Jimmy.
Forget the deal.

1474
01:19:57,214 --> 01:20:00,717
The deal is dead.
You know me, the deal's dead.

1475
01:20:00,801 --> 01:20:03,178
Am I talking
about the deal?

1476
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:05,597
That's over.

1477
01:20:05,681 --> 01:20:08,350
Please...
let's talk about you.

1478
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:17,693
I'm gonna tell you
something.

1479
01:20:17,776 --> 01:20:20,070
Your life is your own.

1480
01:20:21,947 --> 01:20:24,116
You have a contract
with your wife,

1481
01:20:24,199 --> 01:20:27,202
you have certain things
you do jointly,

1482
01:20:27,286 --> 01:20:30,455
you have a bond there.
And there are other things,

1483
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:36,545
and those things are yours.
You needn't feel ashamed.

1484
01:20:36,628 --> 01:20:39,214
You needn't feel
that you're being untrue

1485
01:20:39,256 --> 01:20:43,469
or that she would
abandon you if she knew.

1486
01:20:43,552 --> 01:20:46,722
This is your life.

1487
01:20:51,977 --> 01:20:53,812
Yes?

1488
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:59,985
Now, I want to talk to you
because you're obviously upset,

1489
01:21:00,068 --> 01:21:03,071
and that concerns me.

1490
01:21:03,155 --> 01:21:05,574
Let's go,
come on, right now.

1491
01:21:05,657 --> 01:21:07,367
Let's go, come on.

1492
01:21:07,451 --> 01:21:09,703
Roma.

1493
01:21:09,786 --> 01:21:12,498
- What?
- The check, it's...

1494
01:21:13,957 --> 01:21:16,126
What did I tell you?

1495
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:18,086
No, what did I tell you
about the three days?

1496
01:21:18,128 --> 01:21:20,088
Roma, would you?
I'd like to get some lunch.

1497
01:21:20,464 --> 01:21:24,551
I am talking with Mr. Lingk,
if you please.

1498
01:21:24,635 --> 01:21:28,555
I will be with you in a while.
Just check with Mr. Williamson.

1499
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:32,434
- People downtown said...
- Call them again. Mr. Williamson!

1500
01:21:32,476 --> 01:21:34,561
Yes?

1501
01:21:34,645 --> 01:21:36,688
Mr. Lingk and I
are going to go to the...

1502
01:21:36,772 --> 01:21:39,525
Oh, yes, please.
The police can be...

1503
01:21:39,608 --> 01:21:42,194
- What are the police doing here?
- It's nothing.

1504
01:21:42,277 --> 01:21:46,073
- What are the police doing here?
- We had a slight burglary last night.

1505
01:21:46,114 --> 01:21:48,283
It's nothing,
I was just assuring Mr. Lingk.

1506
01:21:48,367 --> 01:21:50,744
Mr. Lingk? James Lingk?
Your contract went out.

1507
01:21:50,828 --> 01:21:52,704
- Nothing to worry about.
- John, John...

1508
01:21:52,788 --> 01:21:54,581
- Your contract went out to the bank.
- You cashed my check?

1509
01:21:54,665 --> 01:21:56,583
- Mr. Williamson...
- The check was cashed.

1510
01:21:56,667 --> 01:21:59,294
The contract was filed
and deposited in the bank,

1511
01:21:59,336 --> 01:22:01,755
and we're completely insured
in any case, as you know.

1512
01:22:01,839 --> 01:22:05,926
- You cashed the check?
- Not to my knowledge, no.

1513
01:22:06,009 --> 01:22:08,804
- Though I'm sure we can...
- Not to my knowledge.

1514
01:22:08,846 --> 01:22:12,141
Christ! I...
Oh, Christ.

1515
01:22:12,266 --> 01:22:14,685
Don't follow me,
just don't follow me, okay?

1516
01:22:17,271 --> 01:22:19,940
I've let you down.
I know I've let you down.

1517
01:22:19,982 --> 01:22:23,277
I'm sorry, forgive me. I-I...

1518
01:22:24,611 --> 01:22:27,364
I don't...
I don't know anymore.

1519
01:22:28,907 --> 01:22:33,495
I... forgive me.

1520
01:22:47,718 --> 01:22:50,471
You stupid fucking cunt.

1521
01:22:51,847 --> 01:22:53,974
You, Williamson,
I'm talking to you, shithead.

1522
01:22:54,057 --> 01:22:56,685
You just cost me
$6,000.

1523
01:22:56,727 --> 01:23:03,317
$6,000, and one Cadillac.
That's right.

1524
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,736
What are you gonna
do about it?

1525
01:23:05,819 --> 01:23:10,365
What are you
gonna do about it, asshole?

1526
01:23:10,449 --> 01:23:12,367
You're fucking shit.

1527
01:23:12,451 --> 01:23:14,828
Where did you
learn your trade,

1528
01:23:14,912 --> 01:23:17,748
you stupid fucking cunt,
you idiot?

1529
01:23:17,789 --> 01:23:20,209
Who ever told you
that you could work with men?

1530
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:21,668
Could I...?

1531
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:24,213
Oh, I'm gonna have
your job, shithead.

1532
01:23:24,254 --> 01:23:27,007
I'm going downtown.
I'm gonna talk to Mitch and Murray.

1533
01:23:27,049 --> 01:23:31,094
I'm going to Lemkin!
I don't care whose nephew you are,

1534
01:23:31,178 --> 01:23:34,181
who you know,
whose dick you're sucking on,

1535
01:23:34,264 --> 01:23:36,600
you're going out.
I swear to you...

1536
01:23:36,683 --> 01:23:39,311
Hey, fella,
let's get this done.

1537
01:23:41,313 --> 01:23:44,817
Anyone in this office
lives on his wits...

1538
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:47,611
I'm gonna be with you
in a second.

1539
01:23:50,322 --> 01:23:53,992
What you're hired for
is to help us.

1540
01:23:54,076 --> 01:23:56,870
Does that seem
clear to you?

1541
01:23:56,912 --> 01:24:01,792
To help us!
Not to fuck us up!

1542
01:24:01,875 --> 01:24:05,045
To help men who are
going out there

1543
01:24:05,087 --> 01:24:08,590
to try to earn a living,
you fairy.

1544
01:24:08,674 --> 01:24:10,425
You company man.

1545
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:13,470
I'll tell you something else,
I hope you ripped the joint off.

1546
01:24:13,554 --> 01:24:17,057
I can tell our friend here something,
might help him to catch you.

1547
01:24:22,062 --> 01:24:24,439
You wanna learn
the first rule

1548
01:24:24,481 --> 01:24:27,484
you'd know if you ever
spent a day in your life?

1549
01:24:27,568 --> 01:24:32,948
You never open your mouth
till you know what the shot is.

1550
01:24:34,783 --> 01:24:37,494
You fucking child.

1551
01:24:49,756 --> 01:24:52,885
You are a shithead,
Williamson.

1552
01:24:54,761 --> 01:24:57,890
Can't think on your feet,
you ought to keep your mouth closed.

1553
01:24:57,973 --> 01:25:01,143
Can you hear me?
I'm talking to you.

1554
01:25:01,185 --> 01:25:03,020
Yes, I hear you.

1555
01:25:03,103 --> 01:25:06,231
Ricky's right. Can't learn in an office,
gotta learn it in the street.

1556
01:25:06,315 --> 01:25:08,525
And you sure can't buy it,
you gotta live it.

1557
01:25:08,567 --> 01:25:10,569
- Mmmm.
- "Mmmm," yeah!

1558
01:25:10,652 --> 01:25:13,906
Precisely.
Because your partner depends...

1559
01:25:13,989 --> 01:25:15,908
I'm talking to you,
trying to tell you something!

1560
01:25:15,991 --> 01:25:17,034
- You are?
- Yeah, I am.

1561
01:25:17,117 --> 01:25:19,536
- What are you trying to tell me?
- What Roma was trying to tell you.

1562
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:22,956
What I told you a long time ago.
You don't belong in this business.

1563
01:25:22,998 --> 01:25:25,292
You might listen to me.
One day you could say,

1564
01:25:25,334 --> 01:25:27,044
"Hey, maybe the guy..."
oh, fuck it.

1565
01:25:27,127 --> 01:25:30,130
Listen to me now.
Your partner depends on you.

1566
01:25:30,172 --> 01:25:32,758
The man who is your partner,
depends on you.

1567
01:25:32,841 --> 01:25:35,803
You go with him
and for him or you're shit!

1568
01:25:35,844 --> 01:25:38,096
You are shit...
you can't exist alone.

1569
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:40,015
- Excuse me.
- "Excuse you," nothing!

1570
01:25:40,057 --> 01:25:43,185
You be as cold as you want.
You just fucked a good man

1571
01:25:43,268 --> 01:25:45,312
out of $6,000
and his goddamned bonus

1572
01:25:45,395 --> 01:25:47,481
because you didn't
know the shot.

1573
01:25:47,564 --> 01:25:49,858
You can do that and you're not
man enough to say it gets you?

1574
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:52,861
I don't know what...
if you can't take something from that,

1575
01:25:52,945 --> 01:25:55,781
then you're... scum!
You're fucking white bread.

1576
01:25:55,864 --> 01:25:58,867
A child would know it,
he's right.

1577
01:25:58,951 --> 01:26:02,162
If you're gonna make something up,
be sure that it helps.

1578
01:26:02,204 --> 01:26:05,207
Hmm?
Or keep your mouth shut.

1579
01:26:05,249 --> 01:26:08,043
I'm done with you.

1580
01:26:20,597 --> 01:26:22,182
How do you know
I made it up?

1581
01:26:22,266 --> 01:26:24,601
What?

1582
01:26:24,685 --> 01:26:27,604
How do you know
I made it up?

1583
01:26:27,688 --> 01:26:30,190
What are you
talking about, huh?

1584
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:35,904
You said, "Don't make something up
unless it's sure to help."

1585
01:26:37,948 --> 01:26:42,578
- How did you know I made it up?
- What are you talking about?

1586
01:26:49,877 --> 01:26:52,629
I told the customer his contract
had gone to the bank.

1587
01:26:52,713 --> 01:26:54,923
Yeah. Well, hadn't it?

1588
01:26:58,635 --> 01:27:00,596
No, it hadn't.

1589
01:27:03,182 --> 01:27:04,850
Don't fuck with me.

1590
01:27:04,933 --> 01:27:07,352
Don't fuck with me!
What are you getting at?

1591
01:27:07,436 --> 01:27:10,189
I'm saying this, Shelly...

1592
01:27:12,691 --> 01:27:15,319
usually I take
the contracts to the bank,

1593
01:27:15,402 --> 01:27:17,654
last night I didn't.

1594
01:27:19,072 --> 01:27:22,201
Last night I stayed home
with my kids.

1595
01:27:24,203 --> 01:27:26,622
How did you know that?

1596
01:27:28,624 --> 01:27:33,462
One night in a year,
I left a contract on my desk.

1597
01:27:33,545 --> 01:27:35,964
No one knew that but you.

1598
01:27:37,257 --> 01:27:39,009
Now, how did you know that?

1599
01:27:39,092 --> 01:27:42,679
You want to talk to me or you
want to talk to someone else?

1600
01:27:42,763 --> 01:27:44,223
Because this is my job!

1601
01:27:44,306 --> 01:27:48,143
This is my job on the line
and you are gonna talk to me!

1602
01:27:48,227 --> 01:27:51,230
Now how did you know
that contract was on my desk?

1603
01:27:51,313 --> 01:27:53,857
You are so full of shit!

1604
01:27:53,941 --> 01:27:56,276
- You robbed the office.
- Oh, sure, I robbed the office.

1605
01:27:56,318 --> 01:27:58,445
Oh sure! You asshole.

1606
01:27:58,529 --> 01:28:00,364
What did you do
with the leads?

1607
01:28:00,447 --> 01:28:03,158
You wanna go in there?
I tell him what I know,

1608
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,869
he's gonna dig up something.
You got an alibi last night?

1609
01:28:05,953 --> 01:28:09,331
You better have one!
What did you do with the leads?

1610
01:28:09,414 --> 01:28:12,584
If you tell me what you did
with the leads, we can talk.

1611
01:28:12,668 --> 01:28:15,003
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

1612
01:28:15,045 --> 01:28:17,422
If you tell me where the leads are,
I won't turn you in.

1613
01:28:17,506 --> 01:28:19,883
If you don't, I'm gonna tell
the cop you stole them.

1614
01:28:19,967 --> 01:28:23,095
Mitch and Murray will see that you
go to jail, believe me, they will!

1615
01:28:23,178 --> 01:28:24,596
Now, where are the leads?

1616
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:26,723
I'm walking in that door.
You got five seconds

1617
01:28:26,807 --> 01:28:28,433
- or you are going to jail!
- Go ahead.

1618
01:28:28,517 --> 01:28:30,978
I don't care,
you understand?

1619
01:28:32,187 --> 01:28:34,731
Where are the leads?

1620
01:28:36,150 --> 01:28:38,235
All right.

1621
01:28:40,195 --> 01:28:42,156
I sold them.

1622
01:28:51,123 --> 01:28:53,625
To Jerry Graff.

1623
01:28:53,709 --> 01:28:56,003
How much did you
get for them?

1624
01:28:56,044 --> 01:28:57,921
How much did
you get for them?

1625
01:28:58,005 --> 01:29:00,340
Five.
Five grand.

1626
01:29:00,382 --> 01:29:03,260
- I got half.
- Who got the other half?

1627
01:29:03,343 --> 01:29:05,345
Do I have to tell you?

1628
01:29:05,387 --> 01:29:07,931
Moss.

1629
01:29:11,518 --> 01:29:13,562
Well, that was easy,
wasn't it?

1630
01:29:13,645 --> 01:29:16,148
- His idea.
- Was it?

1631
01:29:16,231 --> 01:29:18,484
I think he got
more than five, actually.

1632
01:29:18,525 --> 01:29:21,862
- Uh-huh.
- He told me my cut was 2500.

1633
01:29:21,904 --> 01:29:24,156
Mmm.

1634
01:29:25,699 --> 01:29:27,367
Wait a minute.
Okay... hey, hey, John!

1635
01:29:27,409 --> 01:29:30,621
Wait... okay, John!
Hey, Johnny.

1636
01:29:30,704 --> 01:29:34,208
Listen.
Come here, come here.

1637
01:29:36,376 --> 01:29:38,128
Eh, John?

1638
01:29:38,212 --> 01:29:40,464
Last night...

1639
01:29:40,547 --> 01:29:43,217
I gotta tell you,
I'm ready to "do the Dutch".

1640
01:29:43,258 --> 01:29:46,220
I'm done. Moss gets me,
"Do this, we'll get well."

1641
01:29:46,261 --> 01:29:49,556
Why not? Big fucking deal.
I'm halfway hoping to get caught.

1642
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:53,769
Hey... put me out of my misery.
It taught me something, John.

1643
01:29:53,852 --> 01:29:56,355
What it taught me...
you gotta get out there!

1644
01:29:56,396 --> 01:29:59,775
I'm not cut out to be a thief,
I'm cut out to be a salesman.

1645
01:29:59,942 --> 01:30:02,653
And I am back.
I got my balls back.

1646
01:30:02,736 --> 01:30:06,698
Now... you got a slight
advantage on me.

1647
01:30:06,782 --> 01:30:09,368
But whatever it takes, John,

1648
01:30:09,451 --> 01:30:11,954
to make things right,
we're gonna make it right.

1649
01:30:12,037 --> 01:30:14,623
We are going
to make it right.

1650
01:30:18,043 --> 01:30:19,837
I want to tell you
something, Shelly.

1651
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:23,590
- Eh?
- You have a big mouth.

1652
01:30:23,632 --> 01:30:26,176
What?

1653
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:27,970
You've got a big mouth!

1654
01:30:28,011 --> 01:30:30,764
And now I'm gonna show you
an even bigger one.

1655
01:30:30,806 --> 01:30:32,683
Where are you going?

1656
01:30:32,766 --> 01:30:35,477
You can't do that!
You don't want to do that.

1657
01:30:35,561 --> 01:30:37,813
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1658
01:30:39,565 --> 01:30:43,068
It's $2,500. Go ahead
and take it, take it all.

1659
01:30:43,152 --> 01:30:45,487
No, I don't think so.
I don't think I want your money.

1660
01:30:45,571 --> 01:30:48,490
I think you fucked up my office,
and I think you're going away.

1661
01:30:48,532 --> 01:30:52,494
Are you nuts?
I'm gonna close for you! Take...

1662
01:30:52,536 --> 01:30:55,998
I'm gonna make this office and be
number one on that board again.

1663
01:30:56,039 --> 01:30:58,333
Wait, John.

1664
01:30:58,417 --> 01:31:01,920
John... okay.

1665
01:31:04,715 --> 01:31:09,094
This is what
we're gonna do... 20%.

1666
01:31:09,136 --> 01:31:12,347
I'm gonna give you 20%
of all my sales.

1667
01:31:12,431 --> 01:31:15,350
20%, as long as I'm
with this firm.

1668
01:31:15,434 --> 01:31:17,436
50.

1669
01:31:17,519 --> 01:31:21,982
- 50%of all my sales.
- What sales?

1670
01:31:22,024 --> 01:31:24,193
What sales? My God,
I just closed 82 grand.

1671
01:31:24,276 --> 01:31:27,404
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I'm back! This is just the beginning!

1672
01:31:27,488 --> 01:31:29,948
Just the beginning?
Where have you been, Shelly?

1673
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:32,993
Bruce and Harriett Nyborg...
do you want to see the memos?

1674
01:31:33,035 --> 01:31:36,622
They're nuts.
They used to call in every week...

1675
01:31:36,705 --> 01:31:39,249
when I was with Webb...
we were selling Arizona.

1676
01:31:39,333 --> 01:31:41,376
They're nuts.

1677
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:46,840
Did you see how they were living?
How can you delude yourself?

1678
01:31:46,882 --> 01:31:48,842
- I've got their check.
- Forget it. Frame it.

1679
01:31:48,926 --> 01:31:51,136
- It's worthless.
- The check is no good?

1680
01:31:51,178 --> 01:31:53,555
You want to stick around?
I'll pull the memo. I'm busy.

1681
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:55,516
The check is no good?
They're nuts?

1682
01:31:55,599 --> 01:31:57,434
You want to call the bank?
I called them.

1683
01:31:57,518 --> 01:32:01,188
I called them four months ago
when we first got the lead.

1684
01:32:01,230 --> 01:32:04,024
The people are insane.

1685
01:32:05,484 --> 01:32:08,904
They just like talking
to salesmen.

1686
01:32:13,909 --> 01:32:18,163
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

1687
01:32:20,749 --> 01:32:24,711
- Why?
- Because I don't like you.

1688
01:32:31,468 --> 01:32:33,470
My daughter.

1689
01:32:33,554 --> 01:32:35,764
Fuck you.

1690
01:32:50,946 --> 01:32:53,323
Asshole.

1691
01:32:53,407 --> 01:32:56,577
Guy couldn't find his fucking couch
in the living room.

1692
01:32:58,745 --> 01:33:01,123
What a day.

1693
01:33:01,206 --> 01:33:03,208
Whoo...

1694
01:33:03,292 --> 01:33:05,711
I haven't even had
a cup of coffee.

1695
01:33:09,256 --> 01:33:12,926
Jag-off John opens his mouth,
blows my Cadillac.

1696
01:33:15,429 --> 01:33:19,016
I swear,
it's not a world of men.

1697
01:33:21,518 --> 01:33:24,229
It is not
a world of men, "Machine".

1698
01:33:24,271 --> 01:33:27,107
- Huh?
- It's a world of clock-watchers...

1699
01:33:27,149 --> 01:33:29,776
bureaucrats...

1700
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:32,613
officeholders, what it is.

1701
01:33:33,655 --> 01:33:35,949
It's a fucked-up world.

1702
01:33:38,285 --> 01:33:40,287
No adventure to it.

1703
01:33:40,329 --> 01:33:44,625
Dying breed.
Yes, it is.

1704
01:33:46,293 --> 01:33:50,047
We're the members of a dying breed.
That's... that's...

1705
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:53,884
that's why we got
to stick together. Shel?

1706
01:33:53,967 --> 01:33:56,303
- Huh?
- I want to talk to you.

1707
01:33:56,386 --> 01:33:58,680
I've wanted to talk to you
for some time...

1708
01:33:58,764 --> 01:34:02,643
for a long time, actually.
I said, "The Machine"...

1709
01:34:02,726 --> 01:34:06,146
there's a man
I would work with.

1710
01:34:06,188 --> 01:34:09,942
There's... you know,
I never said a word.

1711
01:34:09,983 --> 01:34:12,945
I don't know why I didn't.
I should've, I don't know why.

1712
01:34:12,986 --> 01:34:16,824
And that shit you were slinging
on my guy today...

1713
01:34:16,907 --> 01:34:21,078
that was so good.
That... it...

1714
01:34:21,161 --> 01:34:23,956
excuse me for saying this,
it's not even my place to say it.

1715
01:34:23,997 --> 01:34:26,583
That was admirable.

1716
01:34:26,667 --> 01:34:29,336
It was the old stuff.

1717
01:34:29,378 --> 01:34:32,965
Hey, I've been
on a hot streak.

1718
01:34:33,006 --> 01:34:36,760
So what?
Things I can learn from you.

1719
01:34:38,846 --> 01:34:41,014
- You eat today?
- Me?

1720
01:34:41,098 --> 01:34:42,599
Yeah.

1721
01:34:42,683 --> 01:34:46,019
Want to swing around the Chinks'...
watch me eat, we'll talk?

1722
01:34:46,103 --> 01:34:48,438
I think
I'll stay around awhile.

1723
01:34:48,522 --> 01:34:50,482
Hello, Mrs. Schwartz?

1724
01:34:50,524 --> 01:34:52,651
This is Richard Roma
with Premiere Properties.

1725
01:34:52,693 --> 01:34:55,654
You or your accountant requested
information on a land investment

1726
01:34:55,696 --> 01:34:58,323
which would offer you
depreciation and the chance

1727
01:34:58,365 --> 01:35:00,576
of a substantial return
on a small investment.

1728
01:35:00,659 --> 01:35:03,078
I'm in from Florida
just for one day...

1729
01:35:03,162 --> 01:35:06,999
- Mr. Levene?
- ...so I only have that one lot left.

1730
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:08,917
Would you come in here,
please?

1731
01:35:09,001 --> 01:35:11,336
I don't have too much time
and I'm on the midnight plane back,

1732
01:35:11,420 --> 01:35:13,881
so if you or your husband
are truly interested...

1733
01:35:13,922 --> 01:35:16,383
because I can't hold
this parcel past...

1734
01:35:16,467 --> 01:35:18,969
Yes?

1735
01:35:19,052 --> 01:35:22,014
Well, what would be better
for you... say, 6:00 or 8:00?

1736
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:27,519
Go ask him. Shel... we're gonna talk?
I'm going to the Chinks'.

1737
01:35:27,603 --> 01:35:29,563
When you're done, come down.
We're gonna smoke a cigarette.

1738
01:35:29,605 --> 01:35:31,732
- I...
- Get in the room.

1739
01:35:31,815 --> 01:35:35,736
Hey. Hey, easy, pal.
That's "The Machine".

1740
01:35:35,777 --> 01:35:38,822
This is Shelly
"The Machine" Levene.

1741
01:35:38,906 --> 01:35:41,241
- Get in the goddamn room.
- Rick, I...

1742
01:35:41,325 --> 01:35:43,494
- I'll meet you at the restaurant.
- Ricky...

1743
01:35:43,577 --> 01:35:45,412
- Ricky can't help you.
- All I want is...

1744
01:35:45,496 --> 01:35:47,539
What do you want?
You want to what?

1745
01:35:47,623 --> 01:35:51,543
- Rick? Rick?
- Hello? Excellent.

1746
01:35:57,716 --> 01:35:57,800
8:00 p.m.
6947 Euclid.

1747
01:35:57,883 --> 01:36:00,594
Not at all...
thank you very much.

1748
01:36:11,271 --> 01:36:14,525
They find the guy
that broke in the office?

1749
01:36:14,608 --> 01:36:17,778
No. I don't know.

1750
01:36:22,616 --> 01:36:24,701
Did the leads
come in yet?

1751
01:36:24,785 --> 01:36:27,246
No.

1752
01:36:35,129 --> 01:36:37,422
Oh God,
I hate this job.

1753
01:36:37,464 --> 01:36:39,591
Anybody wants me,
I'm at the restaurant.

1754
01:36:45,139 --> 01:36:47,975
Hello, Mrs. Delgari?

1755
01:36:48,016 --> 01:36:51,270
Yes... you requested some information
about Rio Rancho Properties?

1756
01:36:51,353 --> 01:36:56,066
Blue skies smiling at me

1757
01:36:56,150 --> 01:37:01,446
Nothing but blue skies
do I see

1758
01:37:01,530 --> 01:37:04,533
In the morning
there's bluebirds

1759
01:37:04,616 --> 01:37:07,578
Singing a song

1760
01:37:07,619 --> 01:37:10,581
Nothing but bluebirds

1761
01:37:10,622 --> 01:37:13,584
From now on

1762
01:37:13,667 --> 01:37:16,795
I never saw the sun
shining so bright

1763
01:37:16,879 --> 01:37:19,631
Never saw things
going so right

1764
01:37:19,715 --> 01:37:22,634
Noticing the days
hurrying by

1765
01:37:22,676 --> 01:37:26,180
When you're in love,
my, how they fly

1766
01:37:26,263 --> 01:37:30,601
Blue days,
all of them gone

1767
01:37:30,684 --> 01:37:35,731
Nothing but blue skies
from now on...

1768
01:38:21,235 --> 01:38:25,864
Blue skies
smiling at me

1769
01:38:25,948 --> 01:38:31,662
Nothing but blue skies
do I see

1770
01:38:31,703 --> 01:38:34,081
In the morning
there's bluebirds

1771
01:38:34,164 --> 01:38:37,209
Singing a song

1772
01:38:37,292 --> 01:38:42,172
Nothing but, nothing but
bluebirds from now on

1773
01:38:42,256 --> 01:38:44,633
Let me tell you
I never saw the sun

1774
01:38:44,716 --> 01:38:46,260
Shining so bright

1775
01:38:46,343 --> 01:38:49,179
Never saw things
going so right

1776
01:38:49,263 --> 01:38:52,015
Noticing the days
hurrying by

1777
01:38:52,099 --> 01:38:55,060
When you're in love,
my, how they fly

1778
01:38:55,144 --> 01:38:59,773
Blue skies
smiling at me

1779
01:38:59,898 --> 01:39:05,112
Nothing but blue skies
do I see

1780
01:39:05,154 --> 01:39:07,364
In the morning
there's bluebirds

1781
01:39:07,447 --> 01:39:10,868
Singing a song

1782
01:39:10,951 --> 01:39:15,706
Nothing but, nothing but
bluebirds from now on

1783
01:39:15,789 --> 01:39:18,167
Let me tell you
I never saw the sun

1784
01:39:18,208 --> 01:39:20,043
Shining so bright

1785
01:39:20,085 --> 01:39:22,629
Never saw things
going so right

1786
01:39:22,713 --> 01:39:25,591
Noticing the days
hurrying by

1787
01:39:25,674 --> 01:39:28,343
When you're in love,
my how they fly

1788
01:39:28,427 --> 01:39:31,472
Blue days

1789
01:39:31,555 --> 01:39:33,974
All of them,
all of them gone

1790
01:39:34,057 --> 01:39:50,282
Nothing but blue skies
from now on

1791
01:39:50,365 --> 01:39:53,202
Now on

1792
01:39:53,243 --> 01:40:01,460
Nothing but blue skies.
