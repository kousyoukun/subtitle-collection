00:38:07,314 --> 00:38:11,341
I do a profile on her
as if she's this complete recluse.

622
00:38:11,418 --> 00:38:13,648
(CHUCKLES ) Like a hermit.

623
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,312
You know? I'm tracking her down.

624
00:38:15,389 --> 00:38:18,415
''Who is the elusive Paris Hilton
and why is she so publicity shy?''

625
00:38:18,492 --> 00:38:20,119
(LAUGHS )

626
00:38:20,861 --> 00:38:22,192
'Cause...

627
00:38:23,664 --> 00:38:25,188
Isn't it? It's good.

628
00:38:25,265 --> 00:38:26,994
'Cause just changing it...

629
00:38:28,535 --> 00:38:30,002
That's first room stuff, Sidney.

630
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:33,096
And call me Clay one more time,
see what happens.

631
00:38:39,213 --> 00:38:40,976
(WHISPERING)
I thought that was quite good.

632
00:38:41,049 --> 00:38:42,243
Sorry.

633
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:53,291
If I give you an interview,
will you Leave me the fuck alone?

634
00:38:54,362 --> 00:38:57,957
-Bill Nathanson, nice to meet you.
-Sidney Young, Sharps magazine.

635
00:38:58,933 --> 00:39:02,596
Huge fan. Lovely to meet you.
I've just seen the film

636
00:39:04,038 --> 00:39:05,403
-Rap Rat.
-Good.

637
00:39:05,473 --> 00:39:06,963
-Did you Like it?
-I did.

638
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:11,478
I did Like it. I did. I Liked
the hamster thing that you played.

639
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,638
-Actually, he's a chipmunk.
-Yeah.

640
00:39:14,215 --> 00:39:15,375
Now, I've done a bit of research

641
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:17,213
and I can see
that you're quite a private man.

642
00:39:17,285 --> 00:39:19,845
-Is that right?
-Well, I Like to keep a line...

643
00:39:19,921 --> 00:39:24,085
I think that's great. That's brilliant,
but today, let's get behind the mask.

644
00:39:24,492 --> 00:39:27,484
I don't think there really is a mask,
as such.

645
00:39:27,595 --> 00:39:29,859
I don't mean to be a pain,
but what I really want to talk about today

646
00:39:29,931 --> 00:39:31,023
is the new musical...

647
00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:32,691
-Yeah.
-...and keep it about the work.

648
00:39:32,767 --> 00:39:34,632
-Is that all right?
-Okay.

649
00:39:34,736 --> 00:39:37,000
First question. Are you Jewish?

650
00:39:38,473 --> 00:39:41,135
I don't see what the relevance of that is.

651
00:39:41,976 --> 00:39:44,911
Okay. Well, fine. Second question.

652
00:39:44,979 --> 00:39:47,573
The hamster thing that you play
in the film...

653
00:39:47,648 --> 00:39:49,775
-It's a chipmunk.
-Whatever.

654
00:39:49,851 --> 00:39:51,250
Is that gay?

655
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,286
-It's a chipmunk.
-I know, yeah, but is it a gay chipmunk?

656
00:39:57,492 --> 00:40:00,257
Look, it's a kids' cartoon.
It's just a chipmunk, okay?

657
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:02,797
I mean,
I don't think chipmunks can be gay.

658
00:40:02,865 --> 00:40:06,266
ALL right. So it's straight.
It's a straight chipmunk.

659
00:40:06,635 --> 00:40:09,468
-Yeah, absolutely.
-Okay. Got that. So...

660
00:40:12,508 --> 00:40:13,941
Are you gay?

661
00:40:19,014 --> 00:40:20,208
I was...

662
00:40:21,383 --> 00:40:22,577
I was trying to probe.

663
00:40:22,651 --> 00:40:26,109
You want to probe,
become a proctologist.

664
00:40:26,188 --> 00:40:27,212
(LAUGHS )

665
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:35,586
You can't ask a musical comedy star
whether he's Jewish or gay.

666
00:40:35,664 --> 00:40:39,998
From now on, just assume
they are all Jewish and all gay.

667
00:40:40,102 --> 00:40:41,626
-Okay?
-ALL right.

668
00:40:50,145 --> 00:40:53,046
No, I'd Love  this, but I'm so fat I couldn't.

669
00:40:53,148 --> 00:40:55,673
-Get out of here.
-You Look totally rexy.

670
00:40:55,784 --> 00:40:57,274
That's so sweet.

671
00:40:57,619 --> 00:40:58,643
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

672
00:41:03,459 --> 00:41:06,428
I don't mean to be rude, Sidney,
but what the fuck do you want?

673
00:41:06,495 --> 00:41:07,723
You know how things work here.

674
00:41:07,796 --> 00:41:10,128
How am I going to get a piece
in the magazine?

675
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:12,463
I thought all this fluff was beneath you.

676
00:41:12,534 --> 00:41:15,401
It is beneath me,
but things have changed.

677
00:41:15,804 --> 00:41:17,203
What's changed?

678
00:41:17,306 --> 00:41:19,638
Well, I know everybody thinks
I'm a bit of an idiot.

679
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:23,736
Okay, and maybe I didn't have
the best start here, but I want...

680
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,642
I want...

681
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:29,376
I want to have sex with Sophie Maes
before Maddox does.

682
00:41:32,055 --> 00:41:34,023
You're loathsome, do you know that?

683
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:36,820
I know he's got a bit of a head start,
but I think I can win her back.

684
00:41:36,893 --> 00:41:40,021
'Cause once I get my hooks into a girl,
she never gets free.

685
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:42,064
-Like ringworm.
-If you Like.

686
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:46,157
Where are you going?

687
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:54,569
You, buddy. You big corporate dick-lick.

688
00:42:01,017 --> 00:42:04,714
Hello, I'd Like to apply
for a MasterCard, please.

689
00:42:05,522 --> 00:42:08,753
Yeah. Hon Sidney Young.

690
00:42:10,193 --> 00:42:14,892
Hon. H-O-N. It's short for ''Honorable.''
Yeah, it's a British title.

691
00:42:16,065 --> 00:42:18,693
The Queen? Yeah, I know the Queen.

692
00:42:18,768 --> 00:42:21,202
She used to be
in my break-dancing posse.

693
00:42:21,371 --> 00:42:22,963
She's a body-popper
more than anything.

694
00:42:25,308 --> 00:42:26,639
Fuck!

695
00:42:29,145 --> 00:42:31,613
MADDOX: Well, Hello. Cuba !

696
00:42:31,681 --> 00:42:33,205
(CHUCKLING)

697
00:42:33,283 --> 00:42:34,944
He Likes you.

698
00:42:35,652 --> 00:42:37,950
So, how's it feel to be a star?

699
00:42:38,054 --> 00:42:41,854
No, don't, it's so embarrassing. God.
Those pictures are everywhere now,

700
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:44,724
and I had no idea that, that dress
was so see-through.

701
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:47,423
Plus, everybody's talking about it
Like it was some kind of stunt.

702
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:49,227
Such a cynical age.

703
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,428
Hello, Sidney.

704
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:59,438
Hi, I was just Looking for my, you know...

705
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,005
I didn't know you were coming in today.

706
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:03,137
Lawrence is taking us to lunch
at Cipriani.

707
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,175
That's nice.

708
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,408
Lawrence, can I Leave Cuba here?
He doesn't Like Italian food.

709
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:10,976
Of course you can.
He can stay in my office.

710
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:14,689
Sidney, fetch Cuba a bowl of water.

711
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,817
-Will you?
-Of course.

712
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:25,993
That is a Lovely ring.

713
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:30,471
-Where is that from?
-It was my mother's. She gave it to me.

714
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:34,669
You sweetie. That is very, very...

715
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:37,610
So, listen.

716
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:41,711
You've met Vincent Lepak,
haven't you, Sidney?

717
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:43,446
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

718
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,387
See, he has a new movie
coming out soon,

719
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:50,119
and Lawrence is overstretched as it is.

720
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:54,019
How would you Like
to do the feature on him?

721
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,128
Yeah, I would, actually.
Yes, I'd Like that very much.

722
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:00,636
Well, great.

723
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:04,970
Maybe we can get together
and discuss the angle.

724
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:06,067
Okay.

725
00:44:07,846 --> 00:44:09,575
What do you mean, ''angle''?

726
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:13,276
Well, I'd need to know
how we're going to present Vincent.

727
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:15,546
You know, check the story and so on.

728
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:19,019
Are you saying you want copy approval?

729
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:22,024
Any stories written about my clients

730
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:24,823
need to be in their best interest,
that's all.

731
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:28,160
I mean, if things work out with Vincent,

732
00:44:28,566 --> 00:44:31,592
maybe we can talk about
a follow-up story on Sophie.

733
00:44:33,071 --> 00:44:34,732
What do you think?

734
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:40,000
I'm sorry, Eleanor, I don't work that way.

735
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,345
Sidney, dear...

736
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:48,678
Think of it Like this.
You write about one of my clients,

737
00:44:49,454 --> 00:44:51,922
you are borrowing
some of their starlight

738
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:54,014
to help sell your magazine.

739
00:44:54,426 --> 00:44:56,519
ALL I'm saying is quid pro quo.

740
00:44:57,729 --> 00:44:59,856
Sorry. ''Starlight''?

It's Uncle Sidney.
Come to see how you are. Yes.

aren't we?

That's my bag.

00:46:45,137 --> 00:46:46,604
Yeah, I was going to borrow it
for a second.

764
00:46:46,672 --> 00:46:47,798
What are you talking about?

765
00:46:47,873 --> 00:46:49,739
I'll bring it right back.
I was just going to put...

-Give me my bag.
-Just let me borrow it.

767

No. Give me my bag.

-What did you do?

who that is, all right?

was a disappointment.

01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:22,071
Get over it

1707
01:47:26,186 --> 01:47:27,710
Get over it

1708
01:47:33,994 --> 01:47:38,897
D'you want my side,
my side of the story

1709
01:47:40,801 --> 01:47:45,738
D'you want my side,
my side of the story

1710
01:47:47,708 --> 01:47:52,873
Well, I want you,
want you like I'm eighteen

1711
01:47:53,947 --> 01:47:59,352
But I'm tied, tied to my baby

To my baby
Oh!

(ENOUGH LOVE PLAYING)

1714
01:48:16,638 --> 01:48:21,837
What hurts but feels so fine

1715
01:48:22,310 --> 01:48:27,441
What turns water into wine

1716
01:48:27,515 --> 01:48:32,009
lt runs so deep in you and me

1717
01:48:32,086 --> 01:48:38,685
From a fountain to a river
to the seven seas

1718
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:42,662
Too much push and shove

1719
01:48:42,730 --> 01:48:46,564
With not enough love to go round

1720
01:48:46,634 --> 01:48:50,035
l finally found

1721
01:48:50,104 --> 01:48:53,301
There must be enough love

1722
01:48:53,374 --> 01:48:55,365
To go round the world

1723
01:48:55,443 --> 01:48:59,140
There must be enough love

1724
01:48:59,214 --> 01:49:01,205
To go round the world

1725
01:49:01,282 --> 01:49:04,774
There must be enough love

1726
01:49:04,852 --> 01:49:06,683
To go round the world

1727
01:49:06,754 --> 01:49:13,557
There must be enough love, love, love

1728
01:49:22,938 --> 01:49:27,898
Woohoo

1729
