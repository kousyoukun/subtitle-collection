1
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:04,391
It's okay for you to operate here,
but don't forget to pay us our share.

2
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,090
It doesn't look good otherwise.

3
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,429
Those are your rules.

4
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,457
I'm not a yakuza,
so I don't have to pay you anything.

5
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,002
But you're acting like a yakuza.

6
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:20,897
So let the police arrest me,

7
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:26,309
but don't make me
listen to your bullshit.

8
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:28,613
You're dead, asshole.

9
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,649
You're the stupid one.

10
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:38,058
You are the stupid thing.

11
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:05,409
Date?
You've been waiting there half an hour.

12
00:03:07,995 --> 00:03:09,896
He's jilted you.

13
00:03:13,434 --> 00:03:18,031
I'm off soon,
so why not come with me?

14
00:03:19,773 --> 00:03:22,902
We can go to a
disco or something.

15
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,667
The Don, Kitajima,
called a few minutes ago.

16
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,893
He said he'd call again.

17
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:54,235
How did it go?

18
00:03:57,911 --> 00:03:59,311
Let's get him.

19
00:04:02,983 --> 00:04:04,315
I'll take it.

20
00:04:13,527 --> 00:04:15,018
It's the old man.

21
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:30,370
Hello... yes...
Today? I understand.

22
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:37,284
Good to see you again, sir.

23
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:40,885
I thought you decided
to quit and go back home.

24
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:47,083
The café owner needed a waiter
so I figured I'd postpone the trip.

25
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:51,521
Then start acting
and dressing like a waiter.

26
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:53,432
Yes, sir.

27
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:56,366
If you screw me,
I'll make you pay for it, punk.

28
00:04:58,305 --> 00:05:00,035
Sorry, sir.

29
00:05:02,976 --> 00:05:04,308
Off you go.

30
00:05:19,393 --> 00:05:21,123
Murakawa Media.

31
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:26,096
It's for you, sir. It's Kishimoto.

32
00:05:28,902 --> 00:05:30,871
Yes.
Katagiri speaking.

33
00:05:33,473 --> 00:05:35,032
Wait until October?

34
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:39,411
- Tanaka can drive, can't he?
- Yes, he can.

35
00:05:40,113 --> 00:05:41,741
You know the mahjong parlour, right?

36
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:44,214
Yes.

37
00:05:44,384 --> 00:05:45,875
We told you we need it by August.

38
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:49,848
- Go there and wait. I'll let you know.
- Understood.

39
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:54,088
"You can't"?

40
00:05:55,829 --> 00:05:57,161
Who do you think
you're fucking talking to?

41
00:05:58,198 --> 00:05:59,496
I'll cut your balls off!

42
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,032
You licked our fucking asses
when you borrowed the cash.

43
00:06:03,303 --> 00:06:04,635
Don't fuck with us now!

44
00:06:24,992 --> 00:06:28,952
Ken, I'm thinking about retiring.

45
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:33,762
We've been living
the hard life too long.

46
00:06:35,035 --> 00:06:36,970
Yes. I'm tired of it.

47
00:06:38,538 --> 00:06:42,168
Maybe you're too rich for this business.

48
00:07:11,505 --> 00:07:16,068
Here they are. I hear their
section's doing really well these days.

49
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:20,941
The new underground means
business on his patch is booming.

50
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:24,108
Our area is lousy in comparison.

51
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:28,314
Well, this new
job might change our luck.

52
00:07:28,588 --> 00:07:31,114
So handle it carefully, okay?

53
00:07:34,961 --> 00:07:39,626
Nakamatsu's group in Okinawa has
started a war against the Anan clan.

54
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:48,001
They are begging for our help.
So we've got to send some troops in.

55
00:07:48,141 --> 00:07:51,976
Murakawa, would you mind flying
down there with some of the boys?

56
00:07:53,747 --> 00:07:57,040
Last time we were sent out to Hokkaido,
three of my men got killed.

57
00:07:57,284 --> 00:07:59,310
I don't really feel like it.

58
00:07:59,553 --> 00:08:02,113
That's how you earned your current
patch. Business is booming, isn't it?

59
00:08:03,854 --> 00:08:10,585
- Show the Don some appreciation.
- Takahashi. Only if you go with me.

60
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:17,193
You know my job. I've got to take care
of the Boss: The syndicate operation.

61
00:08:17,401 --> 00:08:19,870
As much as
I'd like to go with you...

62
00:08:20,037 --> 00:08:25,203
- Who's taking care of my patch?
- You have a good lieutenant, Katagiri.

63
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:31,246
Think about it, will you?
There shouldn't be any bloodshed.

64
00:09:28,371 --> 00:09:30,033
You may smoke.

65
00:09:37,948 --> 00:09:43,353
Nakamatsu might be my sworn brother,
but he's never done anything for me.

66
00:09:44,488 --> 00:09:46,616
He's merely a distant
relative of our family.

67
00:09:46,757 --> 00:09:51,092
Unlike you lot.
You're my immediate family.

68
00:09:51,628 --> 00:09:57,295
We've sworn allegiance and put
our lives into your hands. Boss.

69
00:09:57,667 --> 00:10:00,262
You're putting my
life into his hands, Takashi.

70
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,745
There's a call for you, Mr. Murakawa.

71
00:10:26,963 --> 00:10:28,158
I'm going.

72
00:10:28,365 --> 00:10:29,697
Good night.

73
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:31,897
Ladies, you may join us now.

74
00:11:20,684 --> 00:11:21,879
What d'you want?

75
00:12:28,285 --> 00:12:29,344
What's going on?

76
00:12:29,853 --> 00:12:31,481
Over there.

77
00:12:38,495 --> 00:12:41,090
You're evil, you know that?

78
00:12:58,581 --> 00:13:01,710
Mr. Murakawa, can we talk?

79
00:13:02,552 --> 00:13:03,781
Fuck off.

80
00:13:04,254 --> 00:13:07,656
Please. Be reasonable.
How much do you want?

81
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,191
Sorry, too late.

82
00:13:09,726 --> 00:13:11,058
Mr. Murakawa...

83
00:13:13,296 --> 00:13:15,424
How long
can he last underwater?

84
00:13:15,832 --> 00:13:18,301
A couple of minutes, I guess.

85
00:13:19,369 --> 00:13:21,395
Let's try two minutes.

86
00:13:21,938 --> 00:13:23,804
Push him under.

87
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:30,010
Mr. Murakawa, please, stop this.

88
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,278
Mr. Murakawa, please stop this...

89
00:13:41,358 --> 00:13:43,486
Mr. Murakawa...

90
00:14:27,003 --> 00:14:28,266
Check him.

91
00:14:29,305 --> 00:14:31,831
Up.

92
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,553
Mr. Murakawa!

93
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,688
Still breathing, huh?

94
00:14:53,696 --> 00:14:54,959
Please, stop this.

95
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,166
Try three minutes.

96
00:14:59,469 --> 00:15:01,404
Plunge him.

97
00:15:02,472 --> 00:15:04,498
Stop it, please!

98
00:15:17,887 --> 00:15:19,685
Stop it, please!

99
00:15:20,223 --> 00:15:21,782
Mr. Murakawa!

100
00:15:32,068 --> 00:15:37,905
Boss, there's something fishy
about the Okinawa job.

101
00:15:40,243 --> 00:15:44,078
The old man says we need to put in an
appearance and then they'll negotiate.

102
00:15:44,981 --> 00:15:53,788
Nothing's ever that simple.
We lost three men in the Hokkaido job.

103
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:15,140
It's over three minutes, isn't it?

104
00:16:16,355 --> 00:16:17,155
So it is.

105
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:20,111
Hoist him up.

106
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:43,966
Looks like he's dead. Oh well.
Cover it up.

107
00:16:44,073 --> 00:16:44,699
Yes, sir.

108
00:17:09,532 --> 00:17:11,728
I'm Sakai. Honoured to meet you, sir.

109
00:17:17,874 --> 00:17:19,342
Okumura, sir.

110
00:17:23,813 --> 00:17:26,044
Hirose, sir.

111
00:17:28,618 --> 00:17:30,450
Ito, sir.

112
00:17:31,488 --> 00:17:33,523
I'll have some
of my men join you later.

113
00:17:35,592 --> 00:17:37,320
You'd be happy if
I dropped dead, right?

114
00:17:38,021 --> 00:17:38,736
Sure.

115
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:41,493
I'd feel safe pissing again.

116
00:17:48,738 --> 00:17:50,730
Line up. State your names.

117
00:17:54,744 --> 00:17:56,235
Maeda, sir.

118
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,848
Ohno, sir.

119
00:18:00,116 --> 00:18:01,607
Tsuda, sir.

120
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:08,155
What are you doing here?

121
00:18:10,927 --> 00:18:15,160
Mr. Takahashi said
he'd take me to Okinawa.

122
00:18:15,465 --> 00:18:18,435
Fuck, are we meant to work
with this bunch of kids?

123
00:18:19,402 --> 00:18:23,863
- This is no kiddie's picnic!
- Shut your fucking mouth!

124
00:19:02,312 --> 00:19:04,042
What's going on?

125
00:19:10,353 --> 00:19:12,845
I told you I quit using that stuff.

126
00:19:16,192 --> 00:19:18,127
Welcome to Okinawa, gentlemen.

127
00:19:19,095 --> 00:19:23,157
We'll take you to our office, now.

128
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:26,894
Have some rest and the Boss
will take you out to dinner, later.

129
00:19:29,138 --> 00:19:30,936
Hi, my name's Ryoji.

130
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,075
I have some drinks and ice cream here,
so if you want some, let me know.

131
00:19:36,045 --> 00:19:38,473
Shiraishi, let's go.

132
00:20:40,243 --> 00:20:42,178
Want something to drink?

133
00:20:44,113 --> 00:20:47,572
No. My stomach still hurts
from where you stabbed me.

134
00:21:42,138 --> 00:21:43,936
What luxury, they're spoiling us.

135
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,880
We haven't used
this office for quite a while.

136
00:21:51,781 --> 00:21:56,048
It's a bit messy, but you won't be staying
here for long, so I guess it's okay.

137
00:21:56,185 --> 00:21:58,381
The toilet is over there.

138
00:22:00,523 --> 00:22:02,014
Ryoji, bring the guns.

139
00:22:02,691 --> 00:22:03,450
Okay.

140
00:22:04,994 --> 00:22:08,487
I doubt you'll need these, but in case
you feel lonely, take your pick.

141
00:22:11,534 --> 00:22:15,198
We conned these out of some Yanks,
so I don't know if they're any good.

142
00:22:20,543 --> 00:22:22,011
What the fuck's that about?

143
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:28,150
Just the Anan lot saying "hello".
Often happens.

144
00:22:28,851 --> 00:22:34,017
But I'm sure there'll be a truce soon.

145
00:22:41,764 --> 00:22:44,256
What happens now?

146
00:22:44,967 --> 00:22:50,133
Our boss phoned the
Anan clan a little while ago.

147
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:55,539
Apparently your
arrival's got them a bit excited.

148
00:23:00,283 --> 00:23:03,117
How many of you does
it take to put a kettle on?

149
00:23:15,765 --> 00:23:19,861
Boss, I suppose we ought
to return their greeting.

150
00:23:28,611 --> 00:23:30,136
Here I go.

151
00:24:41,317 --> 00:24:44,048
Well that was impressive.

152
00:24:46,155 --> 00:24:50,092
The fucking Yank sold me a dud again.

153
00:24:51,794 --> 00:24:53,023
Now what?

154
00:25:04,974 --> 00:25:09,344
It all started out with an idiot from
our group shooting an Anan man.

155
00:25:09,712 --> 00:25:14,980
It's nothing serious, though.
The other man didn't even die.

156
00:25:16,185 --> 00:25:19,246
So we didn't need any help.

157
00:25:19,388 --> 00:25:22,825
But your old man insisted
on sending you across.

158
00:25:24,026 --> 00:25:26,894
I think he's overreacting.

159
00:25:27,229 --> 00:25:30,529
But thanks for coming anyway.

160
00:25:32,201 --> 00:25:37,731
We were told
that you were desperate.

161
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:45,408
That's news to me.
Like I said, your old man insisted.

162
00:25:46,315 --> 00:25:48,682
It's really nothing serious.

163
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:51,587
Just one of those little problems
we encounter every day.

164
00:25:51,794 --> 00:25:55,697
Not an inter-clan thing or anything.

165
00:26:57,793 --> 00:26:59,489
What are your plans for tonight?

166
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:05,666
Mr. Uechi said he'd take us out.

167
00:27:32,962 --> 00:27:34,828
What part of Tokyo are you from?

168
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:37,425
Nakano.

169
00:27:41,737 --> 00:27:44,332
Then you know
Tommy's, by the station?

170
00:27:46,275 --> 00:27:47,709
Never heard of it.

171
00:27:51,714 --> 00:27:53,114
It's quite a well-known joint.

172
00:27:53,315 --> 00:27:55,011
Didn't you hear me?

173
00:28:06,362 --> 00:28:07,660
Smoke?

174
00:28:11,901 --> 00:28:13,096
What's that?

175
00:28:14,336 --> 00:28:15,668
Marijuana.

176
00:28:17,273 --> 00:28:21,677
I don't do drugs,
I only do amphetamines.

177
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:33,488
- Are you feeling okay?
- I'm fine.

178
00:28:34,523 --> 00:28:36,424
Got a cigarette?

179
00:28:57,746 --> 00:29:02,775
Boss, we'd better split up
into smaller groups from now on.

180
00:29:04,386 --> 00:29:07,754
And let anyone who wants
to go, go back to Tokyo.

181
00:29:10,092 --> 00:29:12,061
They're not playing games here.

182
00:29:35,818 --> 00:29:37,252
Good evening.

183
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:41,787
Wouldn't you be more
comfortable in a booth?

184
00:29:41,957 --> 00:29:42,981
No.

185
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:46,686
- What would you like?
- Beer.

186
00:29:47,463 --> 00:29:49,523
I'll call some hostesses, okay?

187
00:29:56,638 --> 00:29:59,369
This is Tomiko.
Send some girls over.

188
00:30:00,409 --> 00:30:04,005
Send Marie and June,
we're getting busy.

189
00:30:07,249 --> 00:30:09,047
Maybe you know my friend, Kinjo?
He's from Nakano.

190
00:30:09,451 --> 00:30:10,111
Huh?

191
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:15,055
He robbed a supermarket
and barricaded himself inside.

192
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:17,051
Never heard of him.

193
00:30:23,132 --> 00:30:25,067
What about Nanbara, the gang rider?

194
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:29,451
Haven't you got any
respectable friends?

195
00:30:29,571 --> 00:30:33,633
A baseball star from
high school or someone like that?

196
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:50,620
More beer!

197
00:30:54,763 --> 00:30:56,857
Good evening.

198
00:31:06,108 --> 00:31:07,599
What shall we have, beer?

199
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:11,438
Yes, beer.
No, scotch and water. Let's order.

200
00:35:50,092 --> 00:35:51,390
All clear.

201
00:36:12,414 --> 00:36:14,815
This is my brother's house,

202
00:36:15,484 --> 00:36:18,648
but he moved to Osaka last month.
Nobody should bother us here.

203
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:50,183
I'll call Tokyo from the shop.

204
00:36:51,653 --> 00:36:53,417
Call about what?

205
00:36:53,622 --> 00:36:56,751
Just to tell them we're going to hang
out here and see how things develop.

206
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,929
Beer and sake, nothing else?

207
00:37:12,374 --> 00:37:13,808
No.

208
00:37:24,052 --> 00:37:27,352
You'd better shoot straight.
Aim at the can.

209
00:37:28,657 --> 00:37:32,719
You almost got me, dickhead!
I felt it brush my cheek.

210
00:37:43,171 --> 00:37:45,003
Give me the gun.

211
00:37:59,287 --> 00:37:59,947
Let's play.

212
00:38:01,089 --> 00:38:02,614
- Play what, sir?
- Paper, scissors, stone.

213
00:38:07,128 --> 00:38:08,323
You too.

214
00:38:14,669 --> 00:38:15,898
You lost.

215
00:38:18,206 --> 00:38:19,367
What are you playing at?

216
00:38:21,376 --> 00:38:23,242
You could've killed me.

217
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:25,546
Next round.

218
00:38:25,547 --> 00:38:27,914
Come on.
Paper, scissors, stone.

219
00:38:30,919 --> 00:38:31,614
You again?

220
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,086
Wait a second, please.

221
00:38:40,395 --> 00:38:41,488
Next round.

222
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,859
It's the last chamber.

223
00:38:43,164 --> 00:38:47,568
Right. So, here we go...
Paper, scissors, stone.

224
00:38:50,605 --> 00:38:52,130
This time, you lost.

225
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:52,969
Me?

226
00:38:57,245 --> 00:38:59,214
Don't do it, please!

227
00:39:07,789 --> 00:39:08,882
What's the idea?

228
00:39:23,471 --> 00:39:29,240
It was empty all along.
What's his problem?

229
00:39:30,779 --> 00:39:32,008
Watch your mouth, asshole.

230
00:39:32,914 --> 00:39:34,678
You were shitting yourself.

231
00:40:04,312 --> 00:40:07,214
Something funny?
Dance with me.

232
00:40:09,117 --> 00:40:10,210
Some other time.

233
00:42:18,947 --> 00:42:20,176
Hey!

234
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,749
You've been
watching us all this time?

235
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:38,122
You a pervert?
Like watching others fuck?

236
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,425
Answer me, asshole.

237
00:42:51,813 --> 00:42:57,912
You're dead. I mean it.
I'll slit your throat.

238
00:42:59,254 --> 00:43:01,314
I didn't mean it...

239
00:43:21,509 --> 00:43:23,569
You really think that girl killed him?

240
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:30,408
Two shots in the stomach.

241
00:43:34,756 --> 00:43:36,782
- Shall we dump him in the sea?
- Okay.

242
00:43:42,397 --> 00:43:43,831
What about the car?

243
00:43:44,532 --> 00:43:45,830
We'll use it.

244
00:44:37,018 --> 00:44:39,715
Watch your speed, asshole.

245
00:44:54,002 --> 00:44:55,129
Your friend is here.

246
00:45:25,233 --> 00:45:26,861
How is the Boss?

247
00:45:27,435 --> 00:45:30,803
Still talking about a truce all the time.

248
00:45:31,539 --> 00:45:33,064
I just don't understand him.

249
00:45:34,075 --> 00:45:37,603
Here are some fresh clothes.
Nothing fancy, though.

250
00:45:38,546 --> 00:45:39,536
Thanks.

251
00:45:39,814 --> 00:45:41,749
Call me when you need me.

252
00:45:44,919 --> 00:45:46,820
Just a second.

253
00:45:49,123 --> 00:45:54,528
Would you mind handing this
to Marimo at the bar "Chez Moi?"

254
00:45:54,796 --> 00:45:56,424
What is it?

255
00:45:57,665 --> 00:45:59,065
Just a present.

256
00:45:59,567 --> 00:46:01,399
I'm not your messenger boy.

257
00:46:01,669 --> 00:46:03,661
Just do it as a favour, will you?

258
00:46:28,563 --> 00:46:30,862
There's some more clothes over here.

259
00:46:58,292 --> 00:46:59,453
I won!

260
00:47:00,231 --> 00:47:01,352
Okay then...

261
00:47:01,758 --> 00:47:02,958
here comes my favourite.

262
00:47:03,731 --> 00:47:04,531
Who's this then?

263
00:47:04,532 --> 00:47:06,296
Mai-no-umi.
(Note: Famous wrestler)

264
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:32,251
Katagiri, isn't that shirt a bit loud?

265
00:47:33,961 --> 00:47:36,556
- Doesn't it suit me?
- You look absolutely terrible.

266
00:50:16,724 --> 00:50:18,659
Do you mind
if I visit you here again?

267
00:50:19,927 --> 00:50:21,725
Don't bother.

268
00:50:58,466 --> 00:51:04,372
Why do I have to drive you home?
I'm an awful driver.

269
00:51:04,905 --> 00:51:06,464
I don't mind.

270
00:51:06,574 --> 00:51:07,542
I do!

271
00:51:08,109 --> 00:51:10,476
This is my husband's car after all.

272
00:51:11,612 --> 00:51:13,137
What do you mean by that?

273
00:51:15,149 --> 00:51:17,277
When was your first kill?

274
00:51:18,986 --> 00:51:20,215
When I was at high school.

275
00:51:21,489 --> 00:51:22,650
Who was it?

276
00:51:23,557 --> 00:51:24,718
My dad.

277
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:26,889
Why?

278
00:51:27,728 --> 00:51:29,390
He wouldn't let me fuck.

279
00:52:00,995 --> 00:52:02,224
You sit in front.

280
00:52:46,407 --> 00:52:48,399
How can you crash
on such a wide road?

281
00:52:48,776 --> 00:52:50,472
A snake shot out.

282
00:52:50,711 --> 00:52:52,179
You don't have a driving license,
do you?

283
00:52:54,448 --> 00:52:55,643
She was driving.

284
00:52:56,417 --> 00:52:57,350
That's not true.

285
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,188
Give it a push.

286
00:53:04,658 --> 00:53:07,651
Are you sure
you can make it back in one piece?

287
00:53:07,795 --> 00:53:08,956
I'm sure.

288
00:53:15,369 --> 00:53:18,168
Remember to fill it up –
with your own money.

289
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:46,533
Watch out, there's a hole there.
Come to this side.

290
00:53:53,741 --> 00:53:55,334
They're on their way.

291
00:54:18,566 --> 00:54:22,401
Over here! Quick!

292
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:23,503
What's going on?

293
00:54:23,771 --> 00:54:27,333
I'll explain later. Quickly!

294
00:54:47,928 --> 00:54:50,022
Let's go and have a drink.

295
00:55:08,215 --> 00:55:10,514
Boss, isn't it a bit childish?

296
00:55:10,818 --> 00:55:12,514
What else is there to do?

297
00:55:13,721 --> 00:55:18,819
You still wearing that shirt?
It really looks terrible on you. Let's go.

298
00:55:24,431 --> 00:55:27,367
- There're no more traps!
- You're sure?

299
00:55:51,659 --> 00:55:53,150
Where's that water?

300
00:56:00,267 --> 00:56:06,002
This is the last of it...
How are we meant to take a bath?

301
00:56:08,042 --> 00:56:09,977
Just wait until it rains.

302
00:56:26,627 --> 00:56:28,357
Where's the Boss?

303
00:56:29,597 --> 00:56:31,190
He went fishing. With that bird.

304
00:56:32,499 --> 00:56:33,967
She's here again?

305
00:56:35,803 --> 00:56:37,499
I guess she's in love.

306
00:56:42,743 --> 00:56:44,268
Don't you like that shirt anymore?

307
00:56:46,046 --> 00:56:48,140
None of your damn business, asshole!

308
00:56:53,487 --> 00:56:56,082
It's great not to be afraid
of shooting people.

309
00:56:57,558 --> 00:56:59,652
Not being afraid
of killing people means

310
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,252
you're not afraid
of dying yourself, right?

311
00:57:03,797 --> 00:57:07,427
You're tough. I love tough guys.

312
00:57:08,736 --> 00:57:10,671
I wouldn't carry a gun
if I were tough.

313
00:57:11,171 --> 00:57:12,833
But you can shoot
without a second thought.

314
00:57:13,307 --> 00:57:14,639
Because I get scared fast.

315
00:57:15,542 --> 00:57:17,773
But you're not afraid
of dying, are you?

316
00:57:19,246 --> 00:57:21,147
When you're
scared all the time,

317
00:57:21,281 --> 00:57:23,409
you reach a point
when you wish you were dead.

318
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:25,746
I don't get it.

319
00:57:31,291 --> 00:57:34,728
What are your plans now?

320
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:41,134
No word from Tokyo... so we'll probably
head off home in a couple of days.

321
00:57:48,742 --> 00:57:49,801
Fuck me, darling.

322
00:57:52,379 --> 00:57:53,847
You fuck off!

323
00:57:56,850 --> 00:58:02,380
Hey motherfucker, you screwed my girl.
I'll break your fucking neck.

324
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:08,726
Will you shut up, dickhead?

325
00:58:15,035 --> 00:58:16,469
Kiss.

326
00:58:22,176 --> 00:58:23,735
It's raining!

327
00:58:25,646 --> 00:58:28,013
Thank God! Get the shampoo!

328
00:59:25,305 --> 00:59:28,639
It's great not to be afraid
of showing your tits!

329
00:59:55,469 --> 01:00:00,669
That's all?
The fuck do we do now?

330
01:00:08,248 --> 01:00:11,377
Ready? Action!

331
01:00:14,688 --> 01:00:16,486
No good!

332
01:00:18,183 --> 01:00:19,392
Start again.

333
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,080
You've got to come out slowly.

334
01:00:24,431 --> 01:00:25,330
Once more.

335
01:00:25,799 --> 01:00:28,667
Action!

336
01:00:57,931 --> 01:01:02,562
What are you playing at?
Call that dancing?

337
01:01:02,703 --> 01:01:04,331
You've got to enjoy yourself!

338
01:01:05,873 --> 01:01:08,104
I'll dance with you. Once more!

339
01:01:46,513 --> 01:01:49,779
I want to talk to Takahashi.
He's always "out".

340
01:01:50,851 --> 01:01:55,152
He'd better be there next time.
Understood?

341
01:02:00,894 --> 01:02:03,921
Hey.
What happened to the change?

342
01:02:05,432 --> 01:02:07,264
Did you put money in?

343
01:02:09,069 --> 01:02:11,903
You think I'm a fucking
beggar or something?

344
01:02:12,072 --> 01:02:15,428
Of course I put
the fucking money in!

345
01:02:16,009 --> 01:02:18,477
Is your phone a piggy bank?!
Next time it happens, you're dead!

346
01:03:15,435 --> 01:03:19,270
Ouch! Ow, that's hot!

347
01:03:56,810 --> 01:03:58,940
Who's using the gun?

348
01:04:00,313 --> 01:04:02,179
That's over the top.

349
01:04:15,162 --> 01:04:17,427
Stop shooting at us!

350
01:04:49,429 --> 01:04:52,558
- Where's Mr. Murakawa?
- He's gone off again.

351
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:57,299
- My boss wants to see him now.
- About what?

352
01:04:57,471 --> 01:05:01,875
- Maybe about the truce.
- I'll go then.

353
01:05:37,844 --> 01:05:43,794
Your boss's aide, Takahashi,
came to see me yesterday.

354
01:05:44,851 --> 01:05:48,253
He's been finalising
the truce with the Anan clan.

355
01:05:49,058 --> 01:05:50,699
That's good news.

356
01:05:52,659 --> 01:05:57,597
There's one condition...

357
01:05:58,298 --> 01:06:00,426
Anan wants us to disband.

358
01:06:01,535 --> 01:06:03,163
What was your answer?

359
01:06:04,271 --> 01:06:09,141
I told him that was out
of question, and sent him home.

360
01:06:09,809 --> 01:06:14,713
But, Uechi...

361
01:06:15,582 --> 01:06:20,213
I'm thinking about retiring.

362
01:06:21,254 --> 01:06:30,129
I'm old and there's a baby on the way.
So I want you to take over my patch.

363
01:06:31,565 --> 01:06:36,299
You decide whether
to disband or to fight them.

364
01:06:39,139 --> 01:06:41,335
Did Takahashi
say anything about us?

365
01:06:42,876 --> 01:06:51,080
The Murakawa section
will apparently be eliminated.

366
01:06:53,286 --> 01:06:54,914
I see.

367
01:09:04,384 --> 01:09:05,943
Missed every one!

368
01:09:07,687 --> 01:09:09,679
What d'you expect?
There's no way you can hit it!

369
01:09:09,789 --> 01:09:14,056
I'm not Buffalo Bill, asshole.
You try, you fucker!

370
01:09:21,368 --> 01:09:24,395
- I'll tell you when to throw, okay?
- Okay.

371
01:09:24,704 --> 01:09:27,333
Aim over here, okay?

372
01:09:27,674 --> 01:09:30,439
Ready? Now!

373
01:09:33,213 --> 01:09:34,579
Shit! No more bullets!

374
01:09:34,714 --> 01:09:36,444
You're fucking impressive too!

375
01:11:36,035 --> 01:11:38,903
We'll squeeze
Takahashi until he squeals.

376
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:42,673
The Boss has got
no options left anyway.

377
01:12:55,448 --> 01:12:57,849
Mr. Uechi., you go in front.

378
01:13:12,098 --> 01:13:13,726
What is it?

379
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:18,504
Is Mr. Takahashi there?

380
01:13:19,505 --> 01:13:21,133
My name's Takashi...

381
01:13:22,809 --> 01:13:24,471
Must be a mistake.

382
01:13:38,524 --> 01:13:41,585
Should have known he wouldn't
register in his own name.

383
01:14:52,965 --> 01:14:54,399
Takahashi.

384
01:16:06,172 --> 01:16:08,334
I swear I know nothing.

385
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:27,224
Our boss always wanted to
work with the Anan group.

386
01:16:28,995 --> 01:16:34,263
He had to get rid of his
relative Nakamatsu first.

387
01:16:36,235 --> 01:16:42,197
The argument
was the perfect excuse...

388
01:16:43,576 --> 01:16:47,035
for him to eliminate Nakamatsu.

389
01:16:47,914 --> 01:16:49,712
So why expel me?

390
01:16:50,316 --> 01:16:55,186
Your patch is doing
great business. He's greedy.

391
01:16:56,122 --> 01:16:57,556
Listen Murakawa...

392
01:17:00,993 --> 01:17:07,957
The Boss is coming
to Okinawa to see Anan.

393
01:17:10,102 --> 01:17:13,402
You could take over
Nakamatsu's patch.

394
01:17:15,508 --> 01:17:17,670
I can arrange it.

395
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:38,955
You want a go?

396
01:17:41,601 --> 01:17:42,762
Not that.

397
01:18:28,347 --> 01:18:30,543
How do we get back
now you've destroyed our car?

398
01:18:31,984 --> 01:18:33,475
Sorry.

399
01:19:50,196 --> 01:19:51,528
Who are you?

400
01:19:55,935 --> 01:19:57,198
Sorry, I got lost.

401
01:21:06,138 --> 01:21:07,697
Are you coming back?

402
01:21:10,443 --> 01:21:11,536
Maybe...

403
01:21:13,446 --> 01:21:14,937
You'll be here?

404
01:21:15,881 --> 01:21:20,842
Maybe... Can I have a go with it?

405
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:22,653
Go ahead.

406
01:22:24,884 --> 01:22:26,853
I'm going with you.

407
01:22:27,419 --> 01:22:28,614
Forget it...

408
01:22:33,893 --> 01:22:36,021
You're going straight soon.

409
01:25:01,307 --> 01:25:03,003
Fuck you.

410
01:25:04,176 --> 01:25:07,044
In ten minutes, the lights go out.

411
01:25:32,771 --> 01:25:35,673
Remember to fill
her up on your way back.
