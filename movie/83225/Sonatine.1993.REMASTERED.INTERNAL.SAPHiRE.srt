1
00:01:58,686 --> 00:02:01,105
You can operate here,

2
00:02:01,272 --> 00:02:04,358
but remember to pay dues to us.

3
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:06,360
Show some respect.

4
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:08,779
I'm not a "yakuza".

5
00:02:08,988 --> 00:02:12,700
I'm not paying you anything.

6
00:02:13,158 --> 00:02:14,827
But you act like a yakuza.

7
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:20,165
So, the police can arrest me.

8
00:02:20,332 --> 00:02:25,629
But I needn't put up with your bullshit.

9
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,549
Then you're as good as dead!

10
00:02:31,176 --> 00:02:32,803
Don't be an idiot.

11
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,266
You're the idiot.

12
00:03:02,207 --> 00:03:04,460
Waiting for your date?

13
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:08,756
He's not coming.

14
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:17,514
I'll finish work soon, we could go to a club.

15
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:45,793
Boss, Kitajima called you a little while ago.

16
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:48,504
He said he'd call you back.

17
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:53,884
How did it go?

18
00:03:56,929 --> 00:03:59,431
Let's sort him out.

19
00:04:02,101 --> 00:04:04,061
I'll get it.

20
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:14,196
It's the old man.

21
00:04:20,369 --> 00:04:21,954
Hello...

22
00:04:23,038 --> 00:04:24,123
...yes...

23
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,586
Today?

24
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,090
Okay.

25
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,719
How are you, sir?

26
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:40,222
I thought you'd decided to go back home?

27
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:43,892
The cafe needed a waiter so,

28
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:46,395
I thought I'd stay a bit longer.

29
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,940
Act like a waiter then.

30
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,068
Okay, sir.

31
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:56,530
If you muck me about, you'll pay for it.

32
00:04:57,323 --> 00:04:59,366
Sorry, sir.

33
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:20,220
Murakawa Productions.

34
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:25,434
Kashimoto for you, sir.

35
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:29,730
Katagiri speaking.

36
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:38,739
- Tanaka can drive can't he?
- Yes.

37
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,200
You know that mah-jong parlour?

38
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:43,577
Yes.

39
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:49,792
- Go there and wait for me.
- Okay.

40
00:05:51,877 --> 00:05:54,046
You can't?

41
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:58,509
Don't bullshit me!

42
00:05:58,717 --> 00:06:01,637
People like us don't lend money for nothing!

43
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:03,806
Don't dare try it on with us!

44
00:06:24,243 --> 00:06:25,494
Ken...

45
00:06:26,287 --> 00:06:29,415
...I'd like to quit the Yakuza.

46
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:33,586
We've led the tough life for too long.

47
00:06:34,086 --> 00:06:36,755
I'm worn out.

48
00:06:37,548 --> 00:06:41,677
Maybe you're too rich for this trade now...

49
00:07:10,456 --> 00:07:12,082
They're here.

50
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,169
I hear they're doing well.

51
00:07:15,461 --> 00:07:20,007
His patch is booming, thanks to
the new underground line.

52
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:23,302
Our business is lousy.

53
00:07:25,095 --> 00:07:27,681
This trip may change our fortunes.

54
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:31,101
So handle it carefully.

55
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:36,106
The Nakamatsu clan of Okinawa,

56
00:07:36,398 --> 00:07:38,943
is at war with the Anan clan.

57
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:43,280
They're begging us for help.

58
00:07:43,656 --> 00:07:47,326
So we must send some soldiers down there.

59
00:07:47,493 --> 00:07:51,497
Would you fly down there with some men?

60
00:07:52,748 --> 00:07:56,377
Three of my men were killed on our last sortie.

61
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:57,836
I didn't like that.

62
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,799
That's how you earned your patch.

63
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:06,971
Isn't business booming?
Show the boss some appreciation.

64
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:09,640
Only if you go with me, Takahashi.

65
00:08:10,975 --> 00:08:12,601
You know that I must...

66
00:08:12,768 --> 00:08:16,647
...take care of the boss and the syndicate.

67
00:08:16,814 --> 00:08:18,983
I can't go, even if I wanted to.

68
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:20,442
Who'll look after my patch?

69
00:08:20,985 --> 00:08:24,029
Katagiri will be your lieutenant.

70
00:08:24,196 --> 00:08:26,407
Don't worry.

71
00:08:26,532 --> 00:08:30,035
It's an operation to restore peace,
there shouldn't be any bloodshed.

72
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:29,428
You may smoke.

73
00:09:37,728 --> 00:09:40,648
Nakamatsu may be my sworn brother,

74
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,192
but he's never done anything for me.

75
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:45,903
He's only a distant family relative.

76
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:49,531
But you boys are my immediate family.

77
00:09:50,616 --> 00:09:52,534
We've sworn allegiance,

78
00:09:52,743 --> 00:09:56,080
and put our lives in your hands, boss.

79
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,749
You're putting my life in his hands.

80
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:16,058
A call for you, Mr. Murakawa.

81
00:10:25,901 --> 00:10:28,904
- I'm going.
- Goodbye.

82
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:31,448
You may join us now.

83
00:11:19,705 --> 00:11:20,623
Well...?

84
00:11:55,532 --> 00:11:56,700
What...?

85
00:12:27,356 --> 00:12:28,440
What's going on?

86
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:30,526
Over there...

87
00:12:37,574 --> 00:12:40,077
Aren't we naughty ?

88
00:12:57,511 --> 00:13:01,223
Mr. Murakawa, please, listen...

89
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:03,267
Shut up, punk!

90
00:13:03,392 --> 00:13:06,937
Let's be reasonable...
...how much do you want?

91
00:13:07,229 --> 00:13:08,480
Too late.

92
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:14,737
How long can he stay under?

93
00:13:14,903 --> 00:13:17,531
Two or three minutes, I imagine.

94
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,701
So let's try two minutes.

95
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,162
Go ahead!

96
00:13:25,247 --> 00:13:27,291
Mr. Murawaka...

97
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,752
...please don't kill me !

98
00:13:36,008 --> 00:13:38,093
Please, don't!

99
00:14:26,016 --> 00:14:27,851
Check him.

100
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,813
Hey, pull him up.

101
00:14:47,705 --> 00:14:49,081
Still breathing?

102
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:55,296
Please, stop.

103
00:14:56,422 --> 00:14:58,716
Try three minutes.

104
00:14:58,924 --> 00:15:01,010
Go ahead.

105
00:15:01,343 --> 00:15:02,970
No, please...

106
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:20,696
Mr. Murakawa, please!

107
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:37,421
There's something fishy about the Okinawa trip.

108
00:15:39,214 --> 00:15:43,552
The old man says both sides are
waiting for us to restore peace.

109
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:47,097
It's a sticky situation....

110
00:15:49,183 --> 00:15:53,145
We lost three men on the Hokkaido job.

111
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:14,041
Isn't it over three minutes?

112
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,252
Oh, yes.

113
00:16:35,396 --> 00:16:36,897
Oh, we've killed him...

114
00:16:40,484 --> 00:16:43,445
...but never mind. Deal with it!

115
00:17:08,804 --> 00:17:10,848
My name is Sakai, sir.

116
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:19,315
Okumura.

117
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,195
Hirose.

118
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:29,491
ltoh.

119
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:32,870
My men will join you guys.

120
00:17:34,872 --> 00:17:36,749
You'd like to see me dead?

121
00:17:37,249 --> 00:17:40,169
Sure. I'd feel safer having a piss.

122
00:17:48,052 --> 00:17:49,386
Introduce yourselves.

123
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:56,060
Maeda, sir.

124
00:17:56,769 --> 00:17:58,145
Ohno.

125
00:17:59,438 --> 00:18:01,065
Tsuda.

126
00:18:05,486 --> 00:18:07,780
Why are you here?

127
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:11,867
Mr. Takahashi says...

128
00:18:11,992 --> 00:18:14,620
...you can take me to Okinawa.

129
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:17,539
They look green!

130
00:18:18,749 --> 00:18:20,960
This isn't a school outing!

131
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:22,503
What? Bastard!

132
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:02,793
What you doing?

133
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:12,553
I told you to give that up.

134
00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:18,350
Welcolme to Okinawa.

135
00:19:18,517 --> 00:19:22,563
We'll take you to your office.

136
00:19:22,771 --> 00:19:26,317
Rest before the boss takes you out to dinner.

137
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:28,444
Hi,

138
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:30,321
I'm Ryoji.

139
00:19:30,863 --> 00:19:34,700
If anyone wants a drink or an ice-cream, then...

140
00:19:35,326 --> 00:19:36,785
...Let's go, Shiraishi.

141
00:20:39,556 --> 00:20:41,267
Something to drink?

142
00:20:43,227 --> 00:20:47,398
My belly still hurts from when you stabbed me.

143
00:21:41,327 --> 00:21:44,121
I don't believe my eyes.

144
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:51,045
It's quite some time since we used this office.

145
00:21:51,211 --> 00:21:54,965
You won't be here long so,
I hope you don't mind the disorder.

146
00:21:55,674 --> 00:21:58,302
The toilet's over there...

147
00:21:59,803 --> 00:22:02,014
Ryoji, bring the tools.

148
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:08,437
In case you might become lonely, take your pick.

149
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,193
We took these off some Americans.

150
00:22:19,823 --> 00:22:21,867
What's that mean?

151
00:22:25,496 --> 00:22:27,873
Just a friendly welcolme!

152
00:22:28,123 --> 00:22:30,334
Or perhaps...

153
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:32,753
...the end of the war.

154
00:22:41,053 --> 00:22:43,597
Well, what now?

155
00:22:44,348 --> 00:22:49,061
The boss talked to the Anan clan a little while ago.

156
00:22:49,728 --> 00:22:54,900
A few of them got worked up
about you guys coming...

157
00:22:59,697 --> 00:23:01,865
Taking a tea-break?

158
00:23:16,297 --> 00:23:19,925
I guess we must say hello to them?

159
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:29,852
I'll try it now...

160
00:24:40,631 --> 00:24:43,717
Nothing happened, idiot!

161
00:24:45,427 --> 00:24:49,265
It was an American grenade,
you can't rely on them.

162
00:24:50,891 --> 00:24:53,060
Now what?

163
00:25:04,446 --> 00:25:08,826
It all started when my one of my idiots
shot at an Anan man...

164
00:25:09,034 --> 00:25:12,871
Nothing serious...

165
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,332
...nobody was killed or anything...

166
00:25:15,457 --> 00:25:19,378
...and I didn't need any help.

167
00:25:19,795 --> 00:25:23,048
But, your old man insisted on
sending some soldiers.

168
00:25:23,215 --> 00:25:28,178
And, I do appreciate you coming all this way.

169
00:25:31,473 --> 00:25:36,604
We were told that you begged for some help.

170
00:25:37,771 --> 00:25:40,149
News to me...

171
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:45,362
As I said, it was your man who insisted.

172
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:47,865
Nothing serious here...

173
00:25:48,908 --> 00:25:54,622
...just the sort of little problem
we encounter everyday.

174
00:26:57,268 --> 00:26:58,978
What are you doing tonight, sir?

175
00:27:01,814 --> 00:27:05,276
Mr. Uyeji is taking us out.

176
00:27:32,136 --> 00:27:34,263
Which part of Tokyo you from?

177
00:27:35,347 --> 00:27:36,765
Nakano.

178
00:27:39,727 --> 00:27:43,564
Then you know 'Tommy's, by the station?

179
00:27:45,524 --> 00:27:47,484
Never heard of it.

180
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:54,575
- It's a popular place.
- Do you listen?

181
00:28:05,502 --> 00:28:06,837
Smoke?

182
00:28:10,841 --> 00:28:12,760
What's that?

183
00:28:13,594 --> 00:28:15,471
Marijuana.

184
00:28:16,472 --> 00:28:20,809
No. I'm not into that.

185
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:32,529
- You all right?
- Fine.

186
00:28:33,614 --> 00:28:35,741
...Got any cigarettes?

187
00:28:59,473 --> 00:29:02,685
We'll reassemble and split into smaller units.

188
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:07,690
Whoever wants to go home
can go back to Tokyo.

189
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:11,944
This is war.

190
00:29:34,883 --> 00:29:37,011
Hello.

191
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:41,807
- You can relax in a booth.
- No.

192
00:29:42,391 --> 00:29:45,394
- What would you like?
- Beer.

193
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,773
I'll call some hostesses, shall I?

194
00:29:55,988 --> 00:29:59,158
It's Tomiko.

195
00:29:59,575 --> 00:30:03,329
Send some girls, we're getting busy.

196
00:30:06,457 --> 00:30:08,834
You know my friend Kinjo, of Nakano?

197
00:30:10,628 --> 00:30:14,798
He robbed a supermarket and
barricaded himself inside.

198
00:30:14,965 --> 00:30:16,926
I don't know him.

199
00:30:22,306 --> 00:30:25,142
What about Nanbara, a gang leader?

200
00:30:25,392 --> 00:30:28,604
Haven't you any decent friends?

201
00:30:28,771 --> 00:30:33,108
Someone famous, in baseball or something?

202
00:30:48,582 --> 00:30:50,584
Another beer.

203
00:30:54,129 --> 00:30:56,548
- Hi, good evening.
- Good evening.

204
00:35:49,049 --> 00:35:50,593
All clear.

205
00:36:11,238 --> 00:36:14,450
It's my brothers house.

206
00:36:14,617 --> 00:36:18,162
He's in Osaka now. No one will bother us.

207
00:36:46,315 --> 00:36:49,818
I'll call Tokyo.

208
00:36:50,694 --> 00:36:52,655
About what?

209
00:36:52,821 --> 00:36:56,116
Just lie low and keep a check on things out here.

210
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:01,205
- Nothing but beer and sake?
- No.

211
00:37:22,935 --> 00:37:26,021
You better aim straight. At the can.

212
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:31,110
You almost hit me, idiot! I saw it fly past.

213
00:37:42,246 --> 00:37:44,206
Give it to me.

214
00:37:57,886 --> 00:37:58,804
Let's play.

215
00:38:00,097 --> 00:38:03,017
- What, sir?
- Stone, paper, scissors.

216
00:38:05,936 --> 00:38:07,438
You playing?

217
00:38:13,777 --> 00:38:15,654
You're first.

218
00:38:17,031 --> 00:38:19,158
What game?

219
00:38:20,075 --> 00:38:22,953
- You could've killed me!
- Let's continue.

220
00:38:23,495 --> 00:38:27,333
Stone, paper, scissors...

221
00:38:29,627 --> 00:38:32,630
- You again!
- Just hang on...

222
00:38:39,345 --> 00:38:42,097
- Again.
- It's the last chamber....

223
00:38:42,306 --> 00:38:46,977
Stone, paper, scissors...

224
00:38:49,229 --> 00:38:51,148
You lost that time.

225
00:38:55,819 --> 00:38:58,113
No! Don't!

226
00:39:06,538 --> 00:39:08,290
I don't believe it...

227
00:39:22,304 --> 00:39:24,598
...It was empty.

228
00:39:26,392 --> 00:39:28,269
Your boss is a weirdo.

229
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,563
Watch your mouth!

230
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:34,483
And you were shit scared.

231
00:40:03,012 --> 00:40:05,889
Don't just sit there, dance with me.

232
00:40:06,807 --> 00:40:09,268
No, some other time.

233
00:42:26,947 --> 00:42:28,574
You've watched it all?

234
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:32,995
Are you a pervert?

235
00:42:34,413 --> 00:42:36,457
You enjoyed it?

236
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:38,751
Answer me!

237
00:42:50,554 --> 00:42:56,644
You're a dead man. I'll slit your throat!

238
00:42:57,978 --> 00:43:00,272
...What are you doing?

239
00:43:20,251 --> 00:43:23,254
You sure the girl killed him?

240
00:43:26,924 --> 00:43:29,718
Two shots in the stomach.

241
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:35,891
Shall we dump him?

242
00:43:41,063 --> 00:43:43,065
What about the car?

243
00:43:43,232 --> 00:43:45,234
We'll use it.

244
00:44:35,618 --> 00:44:38,078
Drive slowly...asshole.

245
00:44:52,635 --> 00:44:54,470
It's my friend.

246
00:45:23,749 --> 00:45:25,709
How's the boss?

247
00:45:25,918 --> 00:45:29,129
Still talking about the truce.

248
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:32,508
I just can't work him out.

249
00:45:32,716 --> 00:45:36,679
Well, some clothes for you. Nothing fancy.

250
00:45:37,012 --> 00:45:38,180
Thanks.

251
00:45:38,347 --> 00:45:41,058
Call whenever you need me.

252
00:45:43,477 --> 00:45:45,145
Just a minute!

253
00:45:50,734 --> 00:45:53,237
Give these to Marimo at
'Bar Chez-Nous', will you ?

254
00:45:53,445 --> 00:45:55,489
What is it?

255
00:45:56,198 --> 00:45:57,825
A present.

256
00:45:58,158 --> 00:46:02,705
- I'm not your errand boy.
- Please, do me a favour.

257
00:46:27,187 --> 00:46:30,316
There's plenty more over here...

258
00:46:56,842 --> 00:46:58,260
I won.

259
00:47:00,054 --> 00:47:02,056
Let's fight with this.

260
00:47:02,306 --> 00:47:05,100
- What's that?
- Mai-no-umi.

261
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:32,086
So, you like flashy shirts then?

262
00:47:32,628 --> 00:47:35,923
- Doesn't it suit me?
- You look ridiculous!

263
00:50:15,165 --> 00:50:18,002
Can I visit you again sometime?

264
00:50:18,377 --> 00:50:21,505
Wouldn't bother.

265
00:50:57,166 --> 00:50:59,793
Why must I drive you home?

266
00:51:00,336 --> 00:51:02,671
I'm an awful driver.

267
00:51:03,255 --> 00:51:06,342
- Does it matter?
- Yes.

268
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:09,094
This is my husbands car.

269
00:51:10,179 --> 00:51:12,222
Do I have to know!?

270
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,810
When was the first time you killed anyone?

271
00:51:17,436 --> 00:51:19,355
When I was at high school.

272
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,732
Who did you kill?

273
00:51:22,107 --> 00:51:23,442
My Dad.

274
00:51:24,151 --> 00:51:25,736
Why?

275
00:51:26,278 --> 00:51:28,948
He wouldn't let me screw girls!

276
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:01,021
Get in the front.

277
00:52:44,732 --> 00:52:47,192
How could you run off such a wide road?

278
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,111
A snake was crossing.

279
00:52:49,278 --> 00:52:51,447
You've no driving license, have you?

280
00:52:52,907 --> 00:52:56,118
- She was driving.
- I wasn't.

281
00:52:57,786 --> 00:52:59,246
Push.

282
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,003
Sure you'll make it back in one piece?

283
00:53:06,211 --> 00:53:07,963
Go.

284
00:53:13,636 --> 00:53:16,889
You must pay for the petrol.

285
00:53:41,138 --> 00:53:43,307
Watch out for holes.

286
00:53:52,107 --> 00:53:54,068
They're coming...

287
00:54:18,342 --> 00:54:20,678
Over here, quick!

288
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:25,557
- Can we get across?
- Yes! Hurry up!

289
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:48,706
Let's have a drink.

290
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:09,101
Boss, isn't all this rather childish?

291
00:55:09,268 --> 00:55:11,729
What else can I do?

292
00:55:12,271 --> 00:55:15,649
Still wearing that shirt? It's terrible!

293
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:25,659
- There's no more traps.
- You sure?

294
00:55:50,225 --> 00:55:52,269
Water!

295
00:55:58,734 --> 00:56:01,570
No more now,

296
00:56:02,029 --> 00:56:04,365
or else we can't have a bath.

297
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:08,952
You can wait 'till it rains.

298
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:27,346
Where's boss?

299
00:56:28,055 --> 00:56:30,724
Gone fishing, with that girl.

300
00:56:30,891 --> 00:56:33,102
She's here again?

301
00:56:34,144 --> 00:56:36,230
Guess she's in love...

302
00:56:41,193 --> 00:56:43,821
Don't you like the shirt anymore?

303
00:56:44,613 --> 00:56:45,614
None of your business, idiot!

304
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:55,541
It's great to be not afraid of shooting people.

305
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:58,335
That must mean...

306
00:56:58,502 --> 00:57:01,171
...you're not afraid of killing yourself, right?

307
00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:06,510
You're tough. I love tough men.

308
00:57:07,553 --> 00:57:09,805
If I were tough, would I carry a gun?

309
00:57:09,972 --> 00:57:11,724
But you shoot with ease...

310
00:57:11,849 --> 00:57:13,726
Because I scare with ease.

311
00:57:14,393 --> 00:57:16,895
But, you're not afraid of dying...

312
00:57:17,855 --> 00:57:20,024
If you're afraid of death for too long,

313
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:22,109
it become's a death wish.

314
00:57:22,276 --> 00:57:24,528
I don't get it...

315
00:57:29,408 --> 00:57:33,203
What's your plan from now?

316
00:57:34,747 --> 00:57:40,210
There's no word from Tokyo.
We better go home in a couple of days.

317
00:57:47,259 --> 00:57:49,428
"Screw me, darling".

318
00:57:50,888 --> 00:57:52,681
Screw yourself!

319
00:57:55,392 --> 00:58:00,898
"You're pestering my girl".
"Want a fight"?

320
00:58:05,486 --> 00:58:07,738
Will you just piss off!?

321
00:58:14,464 --> 00:58:15,506
''Smack''!

322
00:58:20,584 --> 00:58:22,211
...It's raining!

323
00:58:23,962 --> 00:58:26,382
Quick! Grab the shampoo...

324
00:59:23,647 --> 00:59:26,984
...It's great not to be afraid of showing your tits!

325
00:59:53,427 --> 00:59:56,180
Is that it? What the hell!

326
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:09,026
Ready? Action!

327
01:00:16,575 --> 01:00:18,952
Enter slowly...

328
01:00:20,037 --> 01:00:22,581
Start again.

329
01:00:22,748 --> 01:00:26,210
Ready...Action!

330
01:00:56,156 --> 01:00:57,908
Call that dancing?

331
01:00:59,284 --> 01:01:02,121
You must enjoy yourself.

332
01:01:03,914 --> 01:01:06,125
I'll dance with you.

333
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:46,582
Is Takahashi there?

334
01:01:46,707 --> 01:01:51,670
He's always "out".
He better be in next time.

335
01:02:00,262 --> 01:02:02,765
What about the change?

336
01:02:03,557 --> 01:02:05,809
Did you put money in?

337
01:02:07,102 --> 01:02:10,064
What do you take me for !
Of course I put money in.

338
01:02:10,356 --> 01:02:15,652
Is it a telephone or piggy-bank?
I can kill you for this!

339
01:03:54,209 --> 01:03:56,545
Not fair, you're using a gun!

340
01:04:10,142 --> 01:04:11,769
This isn't playing!

341
01:04:12,936 --> 01:04:14,313
Not fair!

342
01:04:16,523 --> 01:04:20,152
Mr. Murakawa, stop!

343
01:04:47,588 --> 01:04:51,091
- Where's Murakawa ?
- Maybe out on a date.

344
01:04:51,216 --> 01:04:55,512
- My boss wants to see him.
- What about?

345
01:04:55,888 --> 01:04:58,098
Proposing a truce.

346
01:04:58,473 --> 01:05:00,601
I'd better come along.

347
01:05:36,053 --> 01:05:42,100
Your boss's aide, Takahashi,
came to see me yesterday.

348
01:05:43,268 --> 01:05:46,939
He's been concluding
the truce with the Anan clan.

349
01:05:47,314 --> 01:05:49,691
That's good news.

350
01:05:51,109 --> 01:05:56,240
They accept on one condition.
Anan wants us to disband.

351
01:05:59,368 --> 01:06:01,787
What's your response?

352
01:06:02,371 --> 01:06:07,209
I can't do that. I'll fight to the end.

353
01:06:11,296 --> 01:06:13,340
Uyeji...

354
01:06:16,093 --> 01:06:18,679
...I will retire.

355
01:06:19,638 --> 01:06:22,182
She's expecting a baby, and I'm getting old.

356
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:28,313
You take over my patch and the affairs.

357
01:06:29,773 --> 01:06:34,736
Choose whether to fight or disband.
Do as you must.

358
01:06:37,406 --> 01:06:40,075
Did Takahashi say anything about us?

359
01:06:41,034 --> 01:06:43,161
For the time being...

360
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:46,874
...the Murakawa clan will be expelled.

361
01:06:51,378 --> 01:06:52,921
Goodbye, sir...

362
01:09:02,467 --> 01:09:04,595
Ha! Missed!

363
01:09:05,971 --> 01:09:09,516
Impossible! How can I hit it?

364
01:09:09,725 --> 01:09:12,811
It's not some Western. Here, try it.

365
01:09:19,484 --> 01:09:22,696
When I say, okay?

366
01:09:22,988 --> 01:09:25,741
Throw it that way...

367
01:09:25,908 --> 01:09:29,203
Okay? Throw!

368
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:35,083
- Shit, it's empty!
- See, you can't hit it either!

369
01:11:34,411 --> 01:11:37,581
We'll put the heat on Takahashi.

370
01:11:38,498 --> 01:11:41,668
The boss wants to go all the way.

371
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:57,018
Here.

372
01:13:10,990 --> 01:13:12,617
Yes?

373
01:13:16,078 --> 01:13:18,164
Mr. Takahashi here?

374
01:13:18,331 --> 01:13:20,625
I'am Takahashi.

375
01:13:21,709 --> 01:13:24,337
Must be a mistake.

376
01:13:37,683 --> 01:13:40,561
He wouldn't register under his own name.

377
01:14:51,758 --> 01:14:52,508
Takahashi!

378
01:16:05,164 --> 01:16:07,083
I swear I know nothing.

379
01:16:19,804 --> 01:16:24,183
The boss always wanted Anan
to become his partner.

380
01:16:28,146 --> 01:16:33,109
But before that, he had to
get rid of Nakamatsu.

381
01:16:35,278 --> 01:16:39,073
The squabble was the ideal excuse...

382
01:16:40,116 --> 01:16:42,201
...to eliminate Nakamatsu.

383
01:16:46,998 --> 01:16:49,208
So, why expel me ?

384
01:16:49,375 --> 01:16:51,669
Your patch is booming,

385
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,380
he's greedy and wanted a part.

386
01:17:00,011 --> 01:17:03,181
Listen, Murakawa.

387
01:17:04,474 --> 01:17:07,393
The boss is coming to see Anan.

388
01:17:08,978 --> 01:17:13,149
You can take over Nakamatsu's patch...

389
01:17:14,525 --> 01:17:16,778
...I can arrange it.

390
01:17:36,422 --> 01:17:38,341
Your turn.

391
01:17:40,510 --> 01:17:42,053
Not that.

392
01:18:27,390 --> 01:18:30,393
Now we must walk back.

393
01:18:31,018 --> 01:18:32,603
Sorry.

394
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:51,057
Who are you?

395
01:19:54,852 --> 01:19:56,896
I'm lost.

396
01:21:05,089 --> 01:21:07,508
Are you coming back?

397
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:10,887
Maybe.

398
01:21:12,388 --> 01:21:14,390
Will you wait for me?

399
01:21:14,557 --> 01:21:16,893
Maybe.

400
01:21:18,102 --> 01:21:20,438
Can I shoot it?

401
01:21:20,646 --> 01:21:22,273
Okay.

402
01:22:23,793 --> 01:22:26,129
Shall I go with you?

403
01:22:26,295 --> 01:22:28,589
Stupid question.

404
01:22:32,677 --> 01:22:35,805
You've had enough, haven't you?

405
01:24:59,991 --> 01:25:01,742
...Shit.

406
01:25:02,743 --> 01:25:06,164
The lights will go out in ten minutes.

407
01:25:31,272 --> 01:25:34,442
Fill her up on the way back.
