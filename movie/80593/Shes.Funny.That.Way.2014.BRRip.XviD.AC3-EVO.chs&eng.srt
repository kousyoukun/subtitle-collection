2
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,560
我相信美满结局
<i>I believe in happy endings.</i>

3
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,430
而且这是对我来说唯一有意义的事
And it's the only thing that's ever made sense to me.

4
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,190
你知道 我以前常常会把自己 锁在房间里
You know, I used to lock myself in my room

5
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,530
用广播听着所有那些老歌
and watch all the oldies on PBS.

6
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,300
我们付不起有线电视费
We couldn't afford cable, which was fine.

7
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,400
你知道 就是那种少女怀孕时
You know, who needs to watch shows on teenage pregnancy

8
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,070
屋子里还有其他孩子在相互吵闹时 看的那种电视
and kids living in the same house screaming at each other?

9
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,210
在我家那个地方 这被称之为"星期三"
In my neighborhood, that was called wednesday.

10
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,580
那个 我以前还和斯宾塞·屈塞 凯特·赫伯恩一起逃跑过
Well, I used to escape with Spencer Tracy and Kate Hepburn

11
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,410
还和弗雷德·阿斯泰尔 金吉·罗杰斯在舞池旋转过
and Fred Astaire spinning Ginger Rogers on the dance floor

12
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:28,080
最后撞上了劳伦·白考尔
and Bogie finally plant one on Lauren Bacall.

13
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,080
她当时穿着华丽的黑白的裙子
All in glorious black and white.

14
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,820
你喜欢通话? 
You like fairy tales?

15
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,660
我觉得我们是不是都需要一点魔力 你不觉得吗? 
I think we all need a little magic from time to time, don't you think?

16
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,290
我是说 如果默夫云·莱罗依
I mean, what would Lana Turner have done

17
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,130
从来没去过好莱坞和藤街的
if Mervyn Leroy had never gone into Schwab's

18
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,330
嘉信餐厅
on Hollywood and Vine

19
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,860
看到拉娜·特纳在那喝可乐 她会怎么样呢? 
and he saw her there, drinking that coke.

20
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,100
她当时就在那 而那瓶可乐 改变了她的人生
She was discovered right there, and that coke changed her life.

21
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,330
好吧 于是他们告诉游客
Well, so they tell the tourists,

22
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,870
因为那不是嘉信餐厅
because it wasn't Schwab's

23
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,210
事实上那是在日落大道和 卡登大道交汇处的大礼貌餐厅
It was actually a place called top hat on Sunset and McCadden.

24
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,990
而且主人公也不是默夫云·莱罗依
And it wasn't Mervyn Leroy,

25
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,770
事实上是好莱坞的一个记者
<i>it was actually a guy from the Hollywood Reporter.</i>

26
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,610
而且她的名字甚至也不叫拉娜·特纳
And her name wasn't even Lana Turner then.

27
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,150
而是朱迪 事实上 她的真名叫茱莉亚
It was Judy... Actually her real name was Julia.

28
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,350
但这些你全都知道 对吗? 
But you knew all that, right?

29
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:07,190
你知道 尽管这魔力可能不太一样
You know, it doesn't really have the same magic, though.

30
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:15,650
片名：爱你就捧你

31
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,710
这么说你觉得你会来到这 是因为魔力? 
<i>So you think you got here by magic?</i>

32
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,880
这是最纯粹的说法
In its purest form.

33
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,410
我是说 人生中有一千次...
I mean, there are a thousand, no...

34
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,220
不 是一百万次的左右抉择
There are a million lefts or rights.

35
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,220
选择一条路 而不是逃避
Picking up instead of dodging a call.

36
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,490
决定去印度而不是意大利
Deciding on indian instead of italian.

37
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,690
你知道 当你只想睡的时候 强迫自己走出去
You know, willing yourself to go out, when all you want to do is sleep.

38
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,860
我甚至能回溯到我踏出的第一步
I can almost trace it back to the very first step.

39
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,860
像拉娜一样
Blows my mind...

40
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,930
为一个可能改变人生的机会的幻想 而欣喜若狂
To think that just like Lana, a chance encounter changed my life.

41
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,500
当然 我一直觉得能改变我人生的
<i>Of course, I always thought the guy who would change my life</i>

42
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,440
会是像马龙·白兰度那样强大的人
<i>would be powerful like Marlon Brando</i>

43
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,740
或是像加里·格兰特那样闪耀的
<i>or sparkle like Cary Grant</i>

44
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,410
或是想詹姆斯·迪恩那样 穿着皮革的人
<i>or smell like worn leather like James Dean.</i>

45
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,680
艾伯森先生 还有什么 需要我帮忙的吗? 
Mr. Albertson, do you need me for anything else?

46
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,180
-不用 我可以的 谢谢 -好的
-I'm good. Fine. Thank you. -Okay.

47
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,290
你永远不会想到是一个人
<i>You never think it will just be some guy</i>

48
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:18,490
就一个看起来普普通通
<i>who looks like some guy</i>

49
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,560
和我们所有其他人一样平凡的人
<i>who's just as screwed up as the rest of us.</i>

50
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,500
你好 我想我预定了房间 德里克·托马斯
Hello. I think I've a reservation. Derek Thomas.

51
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,830
是的 托马斯先生 你的房间是 1369号套房
Yes, Mr. Thomas. You're in suite 1369.

52
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,870
-好的 -行李员
-Okay. -Bellman.

53
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,370
-谢谢 -不客气 这边请
-Thank you. -Sure. Right this way.

54
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,370
-您从哪飞过来的?  -洛杉矶
-Where'd you fly in from? -Los Angeles.

55
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,210
洛杉矶 我一直都想去那
L.A. I've always wanted to go there.

56
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,610
那边美女如云
A lot of pretty girls.

57
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,380
当然 美女到处都是
Of course, there are a lot of pretty girls everywhere.

58
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,380
这是这个世界上的妙处之一
That's one of the nice things about the world.

59
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,220
先生 你以前在我们这住过吗? 
So have you stayed with us before, sir?

60
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,220
住过
Yeah.

61
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,790
那边现在的天气如何? 
So, how's the weather out there now?

62
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,620
你知道 总是非常的压抑
You know, it's always oppressively perfect.

63
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,460
好吧 看看是谁来了! 
Well, look who's here!

64
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,700
赛斯 亲爱的 我以为你住在皮埃尔
Seth, my darling. I thought you were staying at the Pierre.

65
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,500
我还以为你住在丈母娘家呢
And I thought you were at your in-laws.

66
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,930
没有 等明天德尔塔和孩子们到了 我才去那住
No, not till tomorrow. That's when Delta and the kids arrive.

67
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,900
我一个人应付不了她父母
I can't handle her parents by myself.

68
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,840
-人类最好的朋友 -这是威尔巴
-Man's best friend. -This is Wilba.

69
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,710
你待会儿准备去干嘛? 吃晚饭吗? 
So what are you doing later? You want some dinner?

70
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,910
不吃了 我好累 精疲力尽
No, I'm so worn out. Exhausted.

71
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,480
你知道 还在倒时差
You know, jet lag and everything.

72
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,250
听听我的不幸遭遇吧
It was a very tough little picture.

73
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,310
没睡觉 背部还受伤了
No sleep. Hurt my back.

74
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,480
我最好洗个盐浴 直接就睡了
I better just take an epsom salt bath and go straight to bed.

75
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,360
晚安 咱们排练时见
Goodnight. I will see you at Rehearsals.

76
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,590
你为什么也下来了? 
And why are you getting off?

77
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,560
我住这层啊 1317号房
I'm on this floor. 1317.

78
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,800
真方便 好吧
That's convenient. Okay.

79
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,430
我去睡觉了
I'm going to turn in.

80
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,830
好吧 知道我的导演就在附近 可真令我感到安慰
Well, it's comforting to know my director's close by.

81
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,940
-跟德尔塔问个好 -好的
-Love to Delta. -Okay.

82
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,840
演员啊...
Actors...

83
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,640
是啊 我明白你的意思 我也是个演员! 
Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm an actor!

84
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,510
他们总是有些特别之处的 不是吗? 
There's something special about them, isn't there?

85
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,750
我就是这意思
That's just what I meant.

86
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,980
干嘛? 我们什么都不想买 所以得了吧! 
What? We don't want to buy anything so forget it!

87
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,020
我是和我父母在布鲁克林长大的
I was raised in Brooklyn with my parents,

88
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,420
你知道 那的生活很艰辛
which was tough, you know.

89
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,820
他们很久以前就已经不相信 有什么美满结局了
They stopped believing in happy endings a long time ago.

90
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,860
闭嘴! 我能处理
Shut up! I can handle this.

91
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,590
不! 你才闭嘴
No! You shut up.

92
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,790
但我在努力不去责怪他们
But I try not to blame them.

93
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,290
他们一开始其实挺顺利的
Things started out great for them,

94
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,800
1974年 我妈妈加冕科尼岛小姐
like ma was crowned miss Coney Island, 1974,

95
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,360
全都是因为爸爸
All because of pops.

96
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,970
他是评委中的一员吗? 
He was one of the judges?

97
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,870
不 他当时在街上卖热狗的
No. He was selling the hot-dogs on the boardwalk,

98
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,800
但他观看了整场走秀 而且他看见了我妈妈
but he watched the entire pageant, and he sees my ma,

99
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,070
然后就爱上了她 非常
And he falls for her, like, hard.

100
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,380
所以 他就开始往热狗里 加发霉的芥末
So he starts putting all this rotten mustard in all the hot-dogs

101
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,810
而我妈妈是舞台上 唯一一个没跑去厕所
and my ma is the only one who doesn't run off the stage

102
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,450
释放她肚子的人 所以...
clutching her stomach, so...

103
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,650
就搞定了
That sealed it.

104
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,490
他的主意可多了
But he had a million ideas

105
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,820
而且他以前对我妈妈承诺说 他成就大事业
and he used to promise my ma that it was only gonna be a matter of time

106
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,060
只是个时间问题
before one of them hit.

107
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,660
所以 她在一家豪华沙龙里 找了一份洗头发的工作
So she got a job washing hair in a beauty salon

108
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,590
然后她等啊等...
and she was waiting and waiting...

109
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,430
你知道 20年过去了 她还在给人洗头
And you know, twenty years go by and she's still washing hair.

110
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,100
那你父亲做什么呢? 
What does he do, your father?

111
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,500
他搞发明
He invents things.

112
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,940
比如? 
Like what?

113
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,470
你知道固体胶吗? 
Do you know the glue stick?

114
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,710
他发明的? 
He invented that?

115
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,510
不 他发明了固体黄油
No. He invented the butter stick,

116
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,540
所以 你可以很方便地 用它涂抹你的吐司
so you smooth it on your toast real good.

117
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,480
但...我是说 那在日本很受欢迎
But... I mean, it was huge in Japan.

118
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,780
你好 薇琪公司
<i>Hello, Vickie's.</i>

119
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,920
嗨 薇琪 我现在在巴克利酒店
Hi, Vickie. I'm over at the Barclay

120
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,500
我打电话是想问今晚
and I was calling about the availability

121
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,090
你们的一个陪同人员是否有空
of one of your escorts for this evening.

122
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,660
先生 您指哪一个? 
<i>Which one is that, sir?</i>

123
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,430
就这个网页上的 戈尔
From the webpage here. Glo.

124
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,560
抱歉 能麻烦你稍等一下吗? 
Can you hold on just one minute? I'm sorry.

125
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,660
好的
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

126
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,070
-喂?  -·艾伯森先生
<i>-Hello? -Mr. Albertson.</i>

127
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,540
谁啊 哪位? 
Who's this? Who is it?

128
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,370
是我啊 爸爸 我是大卫
<i>It's me, dad. It's David.</i>

129
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,480
大卫 你在哪啊? 
David. Where are you?

130
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,440
老天 在家啊 不然你以为我在哪
<i>Home. Geez, dad, where do you think I am?</i>

131
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,410
我们现在准备出发了
<i>We're getting ready to leave.</i>

202
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,250

203
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,920
我的客户大都是些可怜人
<i>My clients were mostly poor souls.</i>

204
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,850
魔力完全被掏空了的人
<i>Completely empty of magic.</i>

205
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,790
所以 我的工作就是让他们重获新生

208
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,960

<i>He hired a private eye, called him a gumshoe, to follow me.</i>

213
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,710
我不介意
<i>I didn't mind.</i>

214
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,780
有人总是想知道我在哪 我觉得

00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,830
-我? 是吗?  -是啊
-Me? I am? -Yeah.

262
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:22,270
是啊 真的 你真是个好人
Yeah, you are. You're a real nice guy, you know.

263
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,370
从来没有客户带我去喝酒
No other client ever took me for a drink,

264
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,440
吃饭或是坐马车 你知道吧? 
or for a meal or a buggy ride, you know?

265
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,810
他们只想"脱 干 谢谢你 女士"
They just want to, you know, "wham, bam", thank you, ma'am.

266
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,280
我猜我是那种浪漫型的
I guess, I'm the romantic type.

267
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,120
是啊 的确
Yeah, you are.

268
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,050
的确 你是个浪漫的人
You are. You are a romantic guy.

269
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,450
你想做什么? 我是说 除了这个
What do you want to do? I mean, besides this.

270
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,920
你想做什么? 
What do you want to do?

271
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,960
我想...
I want...

272
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,390
我想演戏
I want to act, you know.

273
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,200
是的 我想当演员
Yeah, I want to be an actress.

274
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,330
当然 那样我爸爸就会因为我演戏
But then, of course, my dad thinks I'm on cloud nine

275
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,070
-开心的上云霄了 -为什么? 
-with the whole acting thing. -Why?

276
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,270
因为在我等到我的机会之前
'Cause it's like I just do this as a way to earn a living

277
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,340
我只是为了谋生才这么做
while I wait until my break, you know.

278
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,110
也能帮家里分担一些
Also help my folks out a little.

279
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,780
也许还有其他更好的谋生之路啊
Well, maybe there's a better way to earn a living.

280
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,950
你知道 当你和男人约会
Well, you know, you date guys...

281
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,280
他们想要什么? 
What do they want?

282
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,080
他们想和你上床
They want you in the sack.

283
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,090
我见过的男人都是这样的
So this way, guys I meet, that's all they want, too,

284
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,820
但至少他们得为此而付钱
but at least they're gonna pay for it.

285
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,390
你知道 你遇到一个 没有任何非分之想的男人
You know, you meet a guy and they expect it for nothing.

286
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,230
这样的话 我就占优势
So this way I figure I'm ahead of the game.

287
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,870
但那真的让我感觉不太好 真的
But it doesn't really make me feel good, really.

288
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,100
我觉得你棒极了
I think you're terrific.

289
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:43,480
你知道 你算是那种 最注重细节的爱侣了! 
You know, you are the most detailed kind of lover!

290
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,120
-注重细节?  -是啊
-Detailed? -Yeah.

291
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,220
感觉...非常棒
Like... That was amazing.

292
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,230
我真的很喜欢你
I really like you.

293
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,000
听着...
Listen...

294
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,570
你想不想很我做笔交易? 
You wanna make a deal with me?

295
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,500
什么交易? 
What kinda deal?

296
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,570
不 不 不 我明天就要走了
No, no, no. I'm, I'm leaving tomorrow.

297
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,140
但如果你...如果你今晚 庄重地对我承诺
But if you... If you promise me tonight, solemnly,

298
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,470
以你的人格担保
on your word of honor,

299
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,180
你永远不会再这么做了
that you'll never do this again,

300
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:15,980
我就给你3万美金
I'll give you $30,000.

301
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,990
什么...给这么多钱做爱吗? 
What... To have sex?

302
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,920
不 不 你知道 因为钱
No, no, you know, for money.

303
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,160
答应我你只会在你喜欢上一个人 的时候才会这么做 而不是因为爱
Promise me you'll only do it when you, when you like someone, or for love.

304
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,200
就因为这个 你要给我3万? 
What you're gonna give me $30,000 for that?

305
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,900
是啊
Yeah.

306
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,400
我是说 这能给你的演艺事业 一个新的开始
I mean, it'll give you a fresh start on your acting,

307
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,500
或是任何你想做的事
and whatever you want to do.

308
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,240
你真是个浪漫的人! 
You are a romantic guy!

309
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,440
但你不是认真的吧? 
But you're not really serious?

310
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,250
不 我是认真的 钱就在行李箱里
No, I'm serious. It's, it's in the suitcase.

311
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,980
没有任何附加条件 我保证 我只是...
No strings attached, I promise. I just...

312
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,280
我觉得你很棒
I think you're great.

313
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,050
真的
I do.

314
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,620
你知道吗 你算是第一个这么说的人
You're kinda the first one, you know?

315
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,430
我爸爸总说 我想去演戏真是疯了
Like, my, my dad always said that I was just crazy for wanting to act

316
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,900
他还说 那永远不可能 成为我的"人生位置"
and he said it was never going to be "my place in life",

317
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,370
他是这么说的
He called it.

318
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,530
-我妈妈也是 -这太荒唐了
-And my mom, too. -That's ridiculous.

319
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,500
没人能告诉你 你的位置在哪
Nobody can tell you where your place is.

320
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,570
我的位置在哪? 别人的位置在哪
Where's my place? Where's anybody's place.

321
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,140
你想知道在哪吗?  就在你觉得幸福的地方
You want to know where it is? Wherever you're happy.

322
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:19,150
那就是你的位置 而你就是最好的裁判
That's where your place is. And you're the best judge of that.

323
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,550
比如 在中央公园里
In central park, for instance,

324
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,320
有些人喜欢给松鼠喂坚果
some people like to feed nuts to the squirrels.

325
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,190
但如果喂松鼠吃坚果让某人觉得开心
But if it makes someone happy to feed squirrels to the nuts,

326
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,490
我凭什么说他是喂松鼠的傻瓜呢? 
who am I to say nuts to the squirrels?

327
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,500
-你说的太好了!  -很棒吧 对
-That is just terrific! -It's good, right.

328
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,430
你能再亲我一次吗? 
Say, could you, could you kiss me again?

329
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,340
在给我3万块之前? 
Before the 30 grand?

330
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,940
你知道 这个人 这个拥有美丽心灵的人
You know, this man, this beautiful person,

331
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,310
他想做的 只是照顾我
all he wanted to do was care for me.

332
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,410
对我来说
For me...

333
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,050
他做到了
And he did.

334
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,590
而且 他在纽约改变了我的人生
And he changed my life, in a New York minute.

335
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,090
你知道 我对他有种
You know, I think I felt something for him

336
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,660
我从未对谁有过的感觉
that I never felt for anybody before.

337
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,720
爱吗? 
Love?

338
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,430
感激
Gratitude.

339
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,000
他用我鼓舞我客户的方式鼓舞了我
He inspired me the way that I inspired my clients.

340
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,370
就算是缪斯女神 也需要一个女神
Even a muse needs a muse.

341
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,240
我会想你的 戈尔...
I'll miss you, Glo...

342
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,340
我是说 伊莎
I mean, Izzy.

343
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,180
不 我会想念你的
No, I'll miss you...

344
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,250
祝你旅途顺利
You have a good trip.

345
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,750
好的 注意安全
Okay. Be safe.

346
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,720
你知道 我永远不会忘记你 德里克
You know, I'll never forget you, Derek.

347
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,090
我也是
Me too.

348
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,650
贾斯汀? 
Justin!

349
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,670
我之前和你提过的那个客户 是个法官
<i>That client I told you about earlier, was a judge.</i>

350
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:55,110
而且他写不出他的裁决 或是观点什么的
And he couldn't write his judgments or opinions or whatever.

351
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:00,010
所以 我帮了他一把 完全把他解救了
So, I worked with him a little bit and yeah, totally helped him out.

352
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,150
问题是 当你鼓舞了某个人
<i>The problem is that when you inspire people</i>

353
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:07,190
他们就想继续 一次一次被鼓舞
<i>they want to keep getting inspired, over and over again.</i>

354
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,060
有时候甚至是几小时
<i>Sometimes for hours.</i>

355
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,760
就像毒品 有瘾
<i>It's like a drug. Highly addictive.</i>

356
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,230
如果你得不到 你就会开始坐立不安
<i>If you don't get it, you start to go batty.</i>

357
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,500
你好 这里是薇琪公司 我们现在暂时无法接听
<i>Hello, this is Vickie's. We're not here right now,</i>

358

<i>but leave a message and we'll call you back soon.</i>

359

<i>-You can't call me... -Hello, hello, Doc.</i>

361
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,740
你为什么那么小声? 你在哪?  尼瓜拉加瀑布吗? 
Why are you whispering? Where are you? Niagara falls?

362
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,480
不 不 不 我不得不给你打电话 是因为...
No, no, no. But I just had to call you because...

363
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,750
戈尔...你知道 我需要再见她一面
Glo... You know. I need to see her again.

364
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,820
-她不干了 -不干了? 
<i>-She's quit. -Quit?</i>

365
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,620
-不干了是什么意思?  -不干了就是不干了
<i>-What do you mean, quit? -Quit means quit.</i>

366
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,220
你愿意找别的人吗? 
Now, would you like anybody else?

367
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,220
我可以送一个非常漂亮的金发姑娘去
I have a very nice blond I can send over.

368
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,360
现在不行 我待会回给你
Not now. I'll call back.

369
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,830
我是薇薇安·克莱蒙特博士
<i>This is Dr. Vivian Claremont.</i>

370
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,840
我在休7年一次的年假 将在托斯卡纳区待6个月
<i>I have gone on sabbatical and will be in Tuscany for six months.</i>

371
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,840
如果有急事找我 可以告诉我女儿
<i>Any of you who need immediate help may speak to my daughter,</i>

372
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,540
找到她就等于找到了我 她的名字叫珍妮·克莱蒙特
<i>who is very empathetic, her name is Jane Claremont.</i>

373
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,850
有任何急事 请拨打她的电话
<i>In an emergency, call her cellphone.</i>

374
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,220
纽约有8百万人
<i>Eight million people in New York</i>

375
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,220
好像大家都彼此认识
<i>and it seems like everyone knows everyone.</i>

376
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,630
谁电话 能赶紧接一下吗? 
Will somebody answer their God damn phone?

377
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:23,230
你母亲没给你留紧急联络方式吗? 
Didn't your mother leave you an emergency line?

378
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,010
该死 该死! 
Shit! Shit!

379
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,800
我可以把这想成是一种提醒我们
<i>I like to think that coincidence is a way of reminding us</i>

380
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
某个有伟大蓝图的人的方式的一种巧合
<i>that there's somebody up there with a master plan.</i>

381
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,250
喂? 哪位? 
Yes? Hello? Who is it?

382
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,700
喂 是克莱蒙特的女儿吗? 
<i>Hello, is this the Claremont daughter?</i>

383
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,870
对 哪位? 
Yes. Who is it?

384
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,240
那个 我现在有紧急事故
Well, I'm having a bit of an emergency.

385
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,140
紧急事故? 好吧 可能只是 你觉得是紧急事故吧
An emergency? All right, you probably just think it's an emergency!

386
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,880
我刚把东西都掉在纽约市街头了
I have just dropped all of my stuff on the street in New York City.

387
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,120
这才叫紧急事故! 您的是什么? 
Now, that is an emergency! What's yours?

388
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,150
那个 我遇到点问题 算是某种强迫症...
Well, I'm, I'm having a problem. It's kind of an obsession...

389
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,520
上瘾? 
<i>An obsession?</i>

390
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,720
好吧 我能告诉你我的经验之谈吗
All right, can I just tell you something from experience,

391
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,390
强迫症并非紧急事故
obsessions are not emergencies.

392
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,660
这是伴随了你一辈子的事
They stick with you your entire life

393
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,260
所以你最好面对它 这东西会伴随你
so you better just face it, that this thing is going to be with you

394
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,670
非常长的时间
for a really long time.

395
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,500
要么你试着克服它
<i>Either you just have to get over it,</i>

396
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,640
要么就应对它 好吗? 
or deal with it, all right?

397
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,410
所以 如果你在工作时间打给我 那很好
So, if you would like to call me during office hours, that's fine.

398
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,840
我周一 周二工作
I work monday, tuesday,

399
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,210
周三上午不工作 也就是现在
not wednesday morning, which is right now.

400
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,380
周四早上也不工作 也就是明天
<i>Not thursday mornings, which is tomorrow.</i>

401
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,590
所以你可以今天下午打给我
So you can call me this afternoon,

402
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,420
或者明天下午和周五全天 好吗? 
tomorrow afternoon or friday all day, all right?

403
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,450
我不想被无聊的事打扰
I don't want to be bothered with nonsense.

404
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,220
拜托 你已经是个成年人了 成熟点! 
Please, you're a grown man. Grow up!

405

Me, me, me, me, me.

407
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,200
约书亚! 拜托 拜托 你能把狗拉住吗? 
Joshua! Please, please, can you just hold the dog?

408
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,510
拜托 我在接电话 正在处理紧急事故
Please. I'm on the phone, I'm dealing with emergencies.

409
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,540
人们需要我 我是个看护员 这就是我的工作
People need me. I'm a caregiver, it's what I do and...

410
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,650
你知道 你真的应该对人更礼貌一些
Well, then, you know, you should really try to be more polite to people.

411
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,920
你今天什么毛病? 
What is it with you today?

412
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,850
有人往你的玉米片里撒尿了吗? 
Did someone take a piss in your cornflakes?

413
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,450
没什么 只是对明天的试镜有点紧张
Nothing. I'm just a little nervous about tomorrow's casting.

414
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,860
有什么大不了的? 不应该...
What is the big deal? It shouldn't...

415
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,360
-我说过 别打给我... -不 是我的电话
-I told you to please not call... -No, it's my phone.

416
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,600
爸爸 现在不是时候
It's not a good time right now, dad.

417
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,600
真不敢相信你是在和你爸爸说话
I cannot believe you're talking to your father.

418
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,270
-他刚打电话来了 -你爸爸! 
-He just called. -Your father!

419
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,310
-我这就给他回 -拜托
-I'm calling him back. -Please!

420
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,670
他打电话给你...感觉你好像 每天都在过父亲节! 
He calls you all the... It's like its father's day with you every day!

421
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,380
我是说 那个人总是打电话给你! 
I mean, the guy calls you all the time!

422
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,310
-不 他没有 -这太奇怪了
-No, he doesn't. -It's a little weird.

423
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,380
-老实说 我受够了 -他只打了我一次电话
-Honestly, I'm getting fed up with it. -He's called me once.

424
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,820
事实上 我受够了 我走了
In fact, I am fed up with it. I'm out of here.

425
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,980
出租车! 
Taxi!

426
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,450
出租车! 
Taxi!

427
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,520
你不要你的狗和购物袋了吗? 
Don't you want your dog or your bags?

428
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,660
你是我见过的最无礼的人
You are the rudest person I have ever met.

429
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,330
走吧 谢普
Come on. Come on, shep.

430
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,100
出租车! 
Taxi!

431
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,870
也许那个法官和珍妮医生 并没有我想象中那么古怪
<i>Maybe that judge or Dr. Jane wasn't as nutty as I remember.</i>

432
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,740
真乖
Good girl.

433
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,940
但记忆不是录像机
<i>But memory isn't a video camera.</i>

434
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,810
对吗? 
<i>Is it?</i>

435
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,480
喂? 弗利特侦探 我们从来都不太忙
Hello? Fleet detectives. We're never too busy.

436
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,680
我不能放弃 我已经想了一晚上了
I can't give up. I've thought about it all night.

437
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,590
我必须见到她 这要求过分吗? 
I've got to see her, is that too much to ask?

438
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,620
稍等 法官 她的窃听器有声音了
Just a minute, judge. Her wiretap just came on.

439
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,860
-发生什么事了?  -她的经纪人在呼叫她
<i>-What's happening? -Her agent is calling her.</i>

440
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,790

<i>Arnold Albertson.</i>

451
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,650
阿诺德·艾伯森? 
Arnold Albertson?

452
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,790
-是啊 他很厉害的 -我从没听说过他啊
<i>-Yeah. He's very good. -Never heard of him.</i>

453
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,630
-他可是顶尖导演之一 -好吧
<i>-He's one of the best. -Okay.</i>

454
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,590
-拜 -好 拜
<i>-Bye. -All right, bye.</i>

455
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,660
好吧 法官 别担心 我会跟着她
<i>Okay, judge, don't worry. I'll follow her.</i>

456
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,630
你还在跟进这个案子 我现在感觉好多了
I feel better now that you're still on the case.

459
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,850
伊丽莎白 对 我们...
Elizabeth, right. We...

460
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,750
喂松鼠吃坚果? 
Squirrels To The Nuts?

461
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,320
天呐 是啊!

-You absolutely changed my entire life! -Have I?

468
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,470
我真不敢相信我现在又撞见你了
I can't believe I'm running into you right now.

469
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:25,500
我用那笔钱开了个服装行 我刚从巴黎回来
I started a dress line with that money. I just got back from Paris.

470
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,410
我现在正要去里约开新店!  我最近还好吗? 
I'm going to Rio to start a deal! How have I been?

471
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,010
好吧 很高兴见到你 我...
Well, it's great to see you, I'm just...

472
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,910
德里克 我怎么联系你? 
Derek, how do I find you?

473
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:35,510
我觉得我在过去的40年里 都被问到这同一个问题
I feel like I've been asking myself the same question the last 40 years.

474
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,080
而我依然不知道 但 听着
And I still don't know, but listen,

475
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,090
我现在有点急事 但我们 还有达拉斯的回忆
I'm just rushing off, but we'll always have Dallas

476
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,020
所以 我很高兴能够帮到你
and I'm so happy I was able to help.

477
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,660
好吧 再次感谢你
Okay, well, thank you again.

478
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,560
-希望能再见到你 -我知道
-And I hope I see you again. -I know.

479
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,080
好 好...
Okay. Okay...

480
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,600
所以 也还有其他人 他帮助过我 也帮助过她们
<i>So there were others. He helped me and he helped them.</i>

481
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,630
我不是说 他这么做是对的
<i>And I'm not saying what he did was right.</i>

482
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,900
我并没有护着他
<i>I'm not defending him.</i>

483
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,140
但他纯粹是为了高兴而这么做
<i>But he did it for the high,</i>

484
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,370
而每次高兴过后 就是毁灭
<i>and after every high there always comes the crash.</i>

485
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,610
阿诺德! 
Arnold!

486
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,610
坐飞机还顺利吗? 
How was the flight?

487
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,880
我的一个客户给了我一次 一生的治疗 作为礼物
One of my clients gave me a lifetime of therapy as a gift.

488
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,690
我的治疗师是个酒鬼
And my therapist was a drunk.

489
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:17,720
所以她就离开去戒酒了 她的女儿 珍妮医生接手了她的工作
So she left to dry out. Her daughter took over, Dr. Jane.

490
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,760
而且她写了这本书
And she wrote this book

491
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,930
《找到你的柔软面》 你知道这本书吗? 
<i>finding your softer side. Do you know it?</i>

492
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,000
-不知道 -大畅销书
-No. -Big best-seller.

493
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,600
她看起来是个很可爱的女人 而且我和她聊天很兴奋
<i>She seemed like a sweet woman and I was excited to talk to her.</i>

494
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:35,610
是啊 是啊 我妈妈已经去了3个月了
<i>Yes, yes. My mother has been gone for three months.</i>

495
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,940
如果你想和我聊 可以
If you would like to talk to me, fine.

496
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,710
如果你不想和我聊 也可以
If you would not like to talk to me, that's fine.

497
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,450
-你决定了吗?  -不
-Have you decided? -No.

498
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,180
不 我是说 我想和你聊聊
No. I mean, I'd like to talk to you.

499
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,550
她去年和一个性感的瑜伽老师
She'd been through a rough break up the year before

500
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,920
分手了
with a hot yoga teacher.

501
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,790
我是说 瑜伽很性感 不是指那个老师
Well, I mean, the yoga was hot, not the teacher.

502
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,920
事实上 那个老师也很性感 但这不是重点
Well, actually, the teacher was, too, but that's not the point.

503
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:57,200
他们在课上认识的 他开始给她上私人课程
They meet in class, and he starts to give her these private lessons.

504
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,630
然后就开始一起住了 结果是
And then they move in together. It turns out

505
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,900
他也给其他的女人上私人课程
he had been giving every other woman in the class private lessons, too.

506
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,870
你能想象吗? 
Can you imagine?

507
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,980
我是说 她的新书叫 《犯贱之美》也就不奇怪了
<i>I mean, no wonder her latest book is called Bitchy Is Beautiful.</i>

508
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,810
那本书我看过 对
That one I read. Yeah.

509
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:14,680
-好吧 请坐 -好 谢谢
-All right, have a seat. -Yeah, thanks.

510
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,120
我看了你的文件 你叫什么来着? 
So, I've taken a look at your file. What's your name again?

511
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,690
伊莎
Izzy.

512
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,520
那是昵称吗? 全名叫什么? 
That's short for something. What's your full name?

513
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,690
抱歉你说什么? 
I beg your pardon?

514
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,620
你全名叫什么? 集中注意
What's your full name? Pay attention!

515
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,720
我叫伊莎贝拉
My name is Isabella.

516
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,090
好 伊莎贝拉
There. Isabella.

517
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,130
而你把它缩减为伊莎
And you've cut it down to Izzy.

518
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,160
那意味着你把你身上的可爱之处缩减了
That means you are cutting off the sweet part of yourself

519
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:36,240
因为伊莎贝拉很甜美 而伊莎很坚硬
because Isabella is so sweet and Izzy is so hard.

520
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,700
这就能看出你的一些性格
There's some insight into your personality right there.

521
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,710
似乎你对你甜美的一面感到不牢靠
It seems that you're insecure with your sweet self,

522
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:43,240
所以你强调那个坚强的自己
so you're emphasizing your tough self.

523
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,810
我说的对不对? 你文件在哪呢? 
Am I right or am I wrong? Where's your file?

524
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,050
好吧...
Okay...

525
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:52,820
亦称为戈尔...为什么还有别名? 
A.K.A. Glo stick... Why A.K.A. Anyway? Do...

526
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,920
应召女郎? 
Call girl?

527
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,090
好恶心
Well, that's disgusting.

528
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,260
我是说 你在做那种事的时候什么感觉
I mean, how do you feel when you're even doing that?

529
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,600
说真的
Honestly.

530
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,830
这份工作有任何积极点吗? 
Are there any up sides to this job?

531
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:10,500
积极点非常多啊 这真的不算问题
Well, there were a lot of ups... That wasn't really the problem.

532
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,770
你不能在做心理治疗的时候开玩笑
You don't joke in therapy.

533
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:16,540
我只是 有点紧张
I'm just... I'm feeling kind of nervous.

534
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,140
你知道 明天我有个真的很重要的面试
You know, I've got this really important audition tomorrow.

535
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,780
什么? 你要面试当应召女郎? 
What? So you're auditioning to be a call girl?

536
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,980
不 不 不 我那样做
No, no, no. I do that on the side,

537
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,550
只是为了帮助我演戏
like, just to kind of support my acting.

538
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:29,220
所以你是要去试镜
So you have an audition.

539
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,090
-什么角色?  -应召女郎
-What's the role? -A call girl.

540
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,560
等等 我刚问过你了
Wait, I just asked you that.

541
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,760
我知道 真的很讽刺
I know, it's so ironic,

542
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,700
但人生有时候就是这样
but life is like that sometimes.

543
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,830
好吧 那太好了 至少你经验丰富
All right, well that's great. At least you have a lot of experience.

544
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,540
该死! 
Shit!

545
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,240
-稍等 -喂? 嗨! 
<i>-Hold on a second. -Hello? Hi!</i>

546
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,970
你听得到吗? 
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

547
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,910
我猜你可能正在做治疗
<i>I guess you're probably in a session.</i>

548
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,850
好极了 是我妈 她喝醉了! 
Great, it's my mother. She's drunk!

549
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,220
他会咬人吗? 
Does he bite?

550
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,250
我不知道 要看情况
I don't know. It depends.

551
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,790
好吧 因为...
Yeah, 'cause...

552
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,560
你在干什么? 抱歉! 
What are you doing? Excuse me!

553
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,890
请从椅子上下来
Please get off the chair.

554
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,890
-你疯了吗?  -我真的不太喜欢狗
-Are you insane? -I don't really like dogs.

555
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,770
不喜欢狗
Don't like dogs.

556
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,770
过来 过来
Come on. Come on.

557
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,740
快点 走 走! 
Go on, scram! Scram.

558
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,970
快点
Come on.

559
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,840
老天 毫无疑问 你真是神经过敏
God, you're neurotic, that's for sure.

560
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,610
我妈妈正从比萨的一家 戒瘾所给我打电话
My mother's calling from a Detox Center outside of Pisa.

561
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,590
喂 我真的需要找个人
<i>Hello, I really need to speak to somebody</i>

562
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,350
说说我的强迫症问题 也许我可以预约
<i>about my obsessional problem. Maybe I could make an appointment.</i>

563
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,620
我现在濒临崩溃边缘 非常崩溃
<i>I'm on the Verge here... The very Verge.</i>

564
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,730
这声音听起来好熟悉啊
That voice sounds so familiar...

565
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:43,760
是啊 它现在也开始让我 听起来觉得熟悉了
Yeah, well, it's starting to sound way too familiar to me.

566
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,030
这家伙完全是个笨蛋
That guy is a total loon!

567
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,140
但我不能说我客户的坏话
But I cannot talk about my clients.

568
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,970
我不能说我的客户
I cannot talk about my clients...

569
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:54,240
因为这很隐私
Because that's private.

570
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,140
所以我不能告诉你那是谁 所以别问我
So I can't tell you who it is, so don't ask me.

571
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:59,140
现在 我说到哪了? 
Now, where was I?

572
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:03,850
如果你愿意接受自己柔软的一面
So if you would just embrace the softer side of yourself,

573
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:06,090
不再生活在坚硬的边缘
and stop living on that hard edge,

574
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,050
你的状态会好一些
you would be in such better shape.

575
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,960
开始叫自己伊莎贝拉
Just start calling yourself Isabella

576
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,030
也许你能解决很多 也许不是全部的问题
and you may solve many, if not all, of your problems.

577
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:17,060
今天我已经放弃当应召女郎了
Well, today I've stopped being a call girl.

578
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,900
太好了! 
That's great!

579
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,100
太棒了! 你看到治疗的好处了吧? 
That's great! You see how therapy works!

580
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,910
就像...就像一块瑞士表
It's like a... It's like a swiss clock.

581
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:29,340
太棒了 你不再需要治疗了 我们的疗程结束了
That's fabulous. You don't need therapy any more. We're finished.

582
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,940
给自己找条大狗 他们是很好的伴侣
Just get yourself a large dog... They're great company.

583
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,050
祝贺你 伊莎...伊莎贝拉
Congratulations, Izzy... Isabella.

584
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,750
你毕业了
You've graduated.

585
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,020
那个 你的名字是人们首先 了解到你的事
Well, your name is the first thing people learn about you.

586
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,390
你知道 这是他们看待你 觉得你是什么样的人的依据
You know, it's how they think of you. It's who you are.

587
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,020
珍妮告诉我的 但...
Dr. Jane gave me that, but...

588
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:49,330
我不再是来自布鲁克林的伊莎怪人了
I wasn't going to be Izzy Finklestein from Brooklyn any more.

589
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:53,170
我将做伊莎贝拉·帕特森
I was going to be Isabella Patterson.

590
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,830
从我想开始的地方开始
From wherever I wanted to be.

591
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,150
见到你太高兴了! 
What a thrill to see you walk in!

592
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:13,450
-德尔塔 你认识乔什?  -当然
-Delta, you know Josh? -Of course.

593
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,390
约书亚 你的剧越来越好了
Your play's only gotten better, Joshua.

594
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,220
谢谢! 等不及看到你表演了
Thank you! I can't wait to see you do it.

595
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,060
嘿 伙计们 抱歉 我迟到了
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.

596
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,790
当然 你们都认识赛斯
And you know Seth, of course.

597
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,930
我们认识吗? 自从伦敦以后 多久没见了? 
Do we know each other? How long's it been since London?

598
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,230
太久了 亲爱的
Too long, dear.

599
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,370
过来
Come here.

600
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,970
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

601
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,900
我们去把大家都召齐吧 珊迪! 
Let's get everybody going. Sandy!

602
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,440
-你看起来美极了 -赛斯 你真会说话
-You're looking gorgeous. -Seth, you're such a charmer.

603
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,110
好吧 但愿如此
Well, I hope so.

604
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,880
你知道赛斯·吉尔伯特会去试镜吗? 
Did you know Seth Gilbert was going to be at the audition?

605
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,750
不 不知道
No. No idea.

606
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,150
我甚至不知道继那些电影之后 他还演戏
I didn't even know he did theater any more, since those movies.

607
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:46,020
记得他有个穿着粉色蝴蝶袖
What's the one where he had like pink, fluffy sleeves

608
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,720
腰带上还挂着小蜜蜂的造型吗? 
and the trained Bumble Bee in his belt buckle?

609
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,420
-《红峰侠》?  -对...
<i>-Red Bee man? -Yeah...</i>

610
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,930
看完5部之后 我就不再关注他了
Well, after all five of those I sort of stopped following him.

611
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,030
那德尔塔·西蒙斯呢? 
What about Delta Simmons?

612
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,230
你想听一些真正有趣的事吗? 
You want, you want to hear something really funny?

613
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,000
当然
Sure.

614
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,370
又一次 她去了沙龙 我妈妈给她洗头
One time, she comes into the salon and my ma washes her hair.

615
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:05,800
于是就有了妈妈和德尔塔 在假火炉上的照片
So we got this picture of ma and Delta above the fake fireplace.

616
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,440
说说宇宙力量吧
Talk about cosmic forces...

617
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,810
现在我有机会跟她合作
Now, I had the chance to work with her.

618
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,750
这就是命运 但我一直没有机会告诉她
<i>It was fate, but I never got to tell her.</i>

619
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,190
让我问你一个问题
"Let me just ask you one question.

620
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:23,860
你答不答应 任何时候当我问...
"Do you promise that whenever I ask the...

621
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,490
任何时候当我告诉你什么
"Whenever I tell you something

622
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:28,930
你永远会站在我身旁 而且你永远不会...
"that you'll always stand by me and that you'll never be...

623
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:34,800
你永远会是我的朋友 而且你永远...
"That you'll always be my friend, and that you'll always...

624
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,470
你是否答应不管我告诉你什么...
Do you promise that no matter what I tell you..."

625
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,040
制片人的女儿
Producer's daughters...

626
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,540
你是否答应无论如何 你永远会是我的朋友
"Do you promise that no matter what, you'll always be my friend..."

627
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,780
太好了 谢谢 很完美
Great, thank you. That was excellent.

628
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,980
我觉得你有点年轻 不过太感谢你来了
I think you're a little bit young, but thanks so much for coming in.

629
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,280
-谢谢 -谢谢
-Thank you! -Thank you!

630
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,980
很好 亲们
Very good, darlings.

631
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,920
好 珊迪 下一个
Okay, Sandy, next!

632
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,820
这是伊莎贝拉·帕特森
This is Isabella Patterson.

633
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,300
天啊
Goodness!

634
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,800
嘿 嘿
Hey, hey, hey!

635
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,370
我们开始了
There we are.

636
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,270
-抱歉 我太紧张了 -别紧张 放松点
-Sorry. I'm so nervous. -Don't be nervous. Just relax.

637
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:13,140
天啊 不 该死
Jesus, no! God damn it!

638
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,510
她不对
She's not right.

639
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:17,010
-为什么?  -因为她不是合适的类型
-Why not? -Because she's not the right type.

640
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:19,950
-乔什 -我觉得她样貌很适合
-Josh... -I think she looks great for it.

641
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,580
放松点
Just relax.

642
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,020
准备好了吗 伊莎贝拉? 
Are you okay, Isabella?

643
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,360
如果你不舒服...
If you're not feeling well...

644
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,190
珊迪 为什么不给她点信息
Sandy, why don't we get her information

645
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,430
然后下次等你更有感觉的时候再来呢
and come back another time when you're feeling more up for it.

646
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,230
不幸的是她病了
She's sick, unfortunately.

647
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,200
不不 我更想今天就完成
No, no, I'd rather do it today

648
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,070
因为我今天观星
because I looked at astrology zone today

649
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:44,300
星象告诉我今天对我来说 是个特别的日子
and it said it was going to be a special day for me.

650
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,510
好吧 我们不想就这个问题争吵
Okay, well, we don't want to argue with that.

651
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,910
继续吧
Let's proceed.

652
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,140
也许会收到惊喜呢
Maybe we'll get surprised.

653
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,340
我准备了3场戏
So, I've prepared three scenes.

654
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,010
我们只拍一场 因为现在压力很大
We're only going to do one because we're under a lot of pressure.

655
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,950
好吧
Okay...

656
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:00,120
那我要演哪个? 
So which one should I do?

657
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,060
阿诺德 你觉不觉得我们应该 先拍我的亲密戏? 
Arnold, don't you think we should do the intimate scene with me?

658
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:08,230
不不 我们要拍两个女人那场
No, no. We're going to do the scene with the two women.

659
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:11,560
你看着很眼熟 你最近是不是去过巴克利银行? 
You look familiar. Were you at the barclay recently?

660
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:12,970
没
No.

661
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,900
赛斯 这场戏里没你
Seth, you're not in this scene.

662
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:19,200
你可以深呼吸一下 咱们让女士们开始吧
So, why don't you take a breather and we'll let the ladies begin.

663
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,410
对不起
I'm sorry.

664
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,880
你没事吧 亲爱的? 要歇会吗? 
Are you okay, dear? Do you need a second?

665
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,250
-不用 -你确定? 
-No. -Sure?

666
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,650
对 我没事
Yeah, I'm fine.

667
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,590
你真的不要喝一杯? 
"You sure you don't want a drink?"

668
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,500
不不 我只是不知道从哪开始
"No, no. I just don't know where to start."

669
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,530
你想从哪开始都行
"Well, start anywhere you like."

670
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:54,110
我只是不知道一切是 怎么发生的 但是...
"I just don't know how it all happened, but...

671
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,640
这是个很希腊式的夜晚
"It was sort of a very grecian evening.

672
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,910
你看
"You see,

673
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:05,350
我这有一大堆工作...
"I got into this line of work where you usually...

674
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,550
在你见证自己最终的命运之前? 
"You don't know who you're going to end up with

675
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,290
你不知道自己最后会遇到什么人
"until you get to your destination.

676
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:12,260
有点像是喜欢 但不亲密
Sort of like a temp, but more intimate."

677
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,360
你说什么呢
"What are you talking about?"

678
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:19,130
这挺难的
"Well, this is really difficult.

679
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:23,970
因为你是我非常亲密的朋友 我真的会把一切都告诉你
"Because you are my very close friend and I do tell you everything

680
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,440
所以我才要告诉你这个
"and that's why I'm telling you this.

681
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,210
不然如果我不在乎你 我也不会告诉你
"Otherwise if I didn't care for you, I wouldn't tell you.

682
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,110
我本来可以永远是你最好的朋友
"And I could go on forever being your best friend

683
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:32,340
你真的不会知道 但我真的需要告诉你
"and you really wouldn't have to know, but I really need to tell you."

684
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,450
-你说什么呢 -这...
-"What are you talking about?" -"Well...

685
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,320
我以前是应召女郎
"I was a call girl

686
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,690
而且我就是个阴招女郎
"and I pretty much am a call girl."

687
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,990
应召女郎! 
"A call girl!"

688
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,730
我问你一个问题
"Let me just ask you one question.

689
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,530
不管我说什么
"No matter what I say,

690
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:54,200
请别用有色眼镜看我
"Please don't judge me

691
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,040
不管我告诉你什么 答应我 你永远会是我的朋友
"And whatever I tell you, promise me you'll always be my friend

692
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,670
你会永远站在我身边
"and you'll always stand by me."

693
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:01,140
当然 什么都行
"Of course. Anything.

694
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,210
我在乎你
"I care about you.

695
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:06,010
但我也非常非常震惊
"But I'm also very, very shocked.

696
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,610
我还感觉难过 那些堕落的混蛋
"And I also feel so sad. Those rotten bastards!"

697
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,350
这么说吧
"Put it this way.

698
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,250
你想不想听坏消息? 
"Do you want the bad news?

699
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,090
或者很坏很坏的消息? 
"Or the bad, bad news?

700
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,220
还是你想听最坏最坏的消息? 
"Or do you want the bad, bad, bad news?"

701
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,020
天啊 还有吗
"My God, there's more?

702
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,190
好吧 就说坏消息吧
"Okay, give me the bad news."

703
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,460
避孕套破了
"The condom broke."

704
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,730
-不 -没错
-"No..." -"Yeah.

705
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,730
很坏很坏的消息是我怀孕了
"And the bad, bad news is that I'm pregnant."

706
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,740
-天啊 -是啊
-"God!" -"Yeah..."

707
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,040
看来我要当阿姨了 也没那么糟
"Well, I guess I'll be an auntie... That's not so bad."

708
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,240
那...
"Well...

709
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,440
最坏最坏的消息? 
"The bad, bad, bad news?"

710
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,650
什么? 
"Yes?"

711
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,520
天啊...
"Gosh..."

712
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,050
什么? 告诉我
"What? Tell me."

713
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,360
爸爸是你的弗雷德
"It was your Fred.

714
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,230
请别恨我 也别恨他
"Please don't hate me. And don't hate him.

715
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:56,560
这只是生活中遇到的那种
"It was just one of those crazy, stupid, weird things

716
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,100
疯狂 愚蠢 怪异的事情
"that happen to you in life

717
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,400
你无法预测 也不能批判
"and you can't predict it and you can't judge it!

718
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,470
所以求你 求你别恨我
"So please... Please don't hate me."

719
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:10,740
太聪明了 亲爱的 太棒了
That was brilliant, darling. That was so good!

720
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,380
亲爱的 她是不是演得很好 阿诺德? 
Darling. Wasn't she so good, Arnold?

721
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,310
很好
Very good.

722
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,620
很好
Very good.

723
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,450
非常感谢你来 我们要迟了 所以..
Thank you so much for coming, we're running late, so...

724
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:22,390
我送她出去 珊迪 你把 下一个女孩带进来
I'll show her out, Sandy. You bring in the next girl.

725
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,560
-很好 伊莎贝拉 -多谢

726
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,790

-Yeah. Bye. -Goodbye!

727
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,430
嘿 我送你出去
Hey, I'll walk you out.

728
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,530
干得好
Well done.

729
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,830
她是不是很棒? 
Wasn't she good?

730
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:36,270
是的 非常棒 无可匹敌
She was. Very. She nailed it!

731
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,600
她是不是很棒 阿诺德? 
Wasn't she good, Arnold?

732
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,510
她确实不错
I did think she was good.

733
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,140
她真的感动我了
She really moved me.

734
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:48,110
好吧 下一个是谁? 咱们继续
Okay, so what's next? Let's move on...

735
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,590
-那么 你是应召女郎?  -在戏里是
-So, you were a call girl? -In the play.

736
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,590
不 你暗示的可不是那样
No, that's not what you've been implying.

737
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,260
对 不是 伊莎是应召女
Yeah, no. Izzy was. Yeah.

738
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,630
但你是伊莎
But you're Izzy.

739
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,730
我是
I am.

740
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:14,110
那你今晚有没有空来吃个晚饭? 
So, are you by any chance free for dinner tonight?

741
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,510
我不知道 估计有吧
I don't know. Yeah, I guess.

742
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,710
好 好
Good. Good.

743
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,780
你今天的表演太震撼了
I was so impressed with that reading today.

744
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:25,620
不过说实话 在试镜之前 我就已经对你印象深刻了 所以...
But, to be honest, I was impressed before the reading too, so...

745
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,190
多谢
Well, thanks a lot.

746
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,390
嗯
Yeah.

747
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,860
你是不是很了解阿诺德·艾伯森? 
Do you know Arnold Albertson that well?

748
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,660
对 我了解他 但不是特别了解
Yeah, I know him. But not very well.

749
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,530
他帮我做这部戏一年了 怎么了? 
He's helped me with the play for a year. Why?

750
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:41,900
没什么 只是他看起来像个好人
Nothing. He just seemed like a really nice guy.

751
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,470
对 尼西亚意大利的吗? 
Yeah... Do you like italian?

752
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,910
意大利菜
Food.

753
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:49,540
好啊 当然
Yeah, sure.

754
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,810
第五大道的尼克饭店怎么样? 
How about Nicks on Fifth?

755
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,410
还是我去你家接你? 
Or should I pick you up at home?

756
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:56,350
不不 我在饭店见你吧
No, no, no. I'll meet you at the restaurant.

757
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,380
-几点?  -8点? 
-What time? -Eight o'clock?

758
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,620
好 没问题 到时候见
Okay, sure. I'll see you then.

759
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,820
好 不过别告诉其他人我约了你
Okay. Don't tell anybody, but I'm rooting for you.

760
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,660
非常感谢
Thanks a lot.

761
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,260
-回头见 -好
-I'll see you later. -Okay.

762
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,400
再见
Bye.

763
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,900
你知不知道电影《蒂凡尼的早餐》? 
<i>Do you know the movie breakfast at Tiffany's?</i>

764
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,590
-知道 -这...
<i>-Yes. -Well...</i>

765
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:22,270
他们在城里什么地方放 我看到张海报
<i>They were playing it somewhere downtown and I see this poster</i>

766
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,210
上面的奥德丽美极了
of Audrey looking so gorgeous.

767
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,180
所以我就买了张票进场
So I bought a ticket and I went in.

768
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,180
连续几星期这部电影 都在我脑海里挥之不去
And, for weeks I couldn't get this movie out of my head, you know?

769
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,450
她把一切都掌握在手心里
She had everything under control.

770
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:34,320
所有问题都搞定了 她什么都不需要
Everything figured out, she didn't need anything...

771
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,250
她是个应召女郎
She is a call girl.

772
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:42,430
也许她只是一个喜欢喝酒跳舞
Well, maybe she was just somebody who liked to have a drink and a dance

773
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,300
传播快乐的女孩
and spread happiness,

774
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,460
如果有个人愿意在她去 化妆间的路上塞给她50块
and if a guy was going to give her 50 on the way to the powder room

775
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:50,340
那也是她应得的 因为她 触碰了他们的生活
then she deserved it because she touched their lives.

776
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,340
我很清楚这是一种痴迷
I'm perfectly aware that it's an obsession.

777
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,710
但也许我对那个女人本人更了解
But maybe if I knew more about the woman herself...

778
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,240
对 那这个让她
Yes, what is it about this woman

779
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,510
如此沉迷的女人到底有什么特别的
that makes her so goddamn obsessionable?

780
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,350
她说话不像我奶奶
She doesn't sound like my grandmother.

781
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,510
什么? 
Say, what?

782
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,680
我认识的每个女人说话都像我奶奶
Every woman I've ever known sounds like my grandmother,

783
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,620
除了这个
except for this one.

784
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,750
戈尔
Glo...

785
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,750
戈尔? 
Glo?

786
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,690
"荧光棒"那种? 
As in Glo stick?

787
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,690
是的 怎么了
Why, yes. Why?

788
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,960
我的天
My God.

789
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,530
"我的天"什么意思
What do you mean, "My God?"

790
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:20,300
我是说 天啊 太棒了
I mean... My God! That's terrific!

791
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,630
真是个好名字
What a terrific... Terrific name.

792
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,870
对 那名字可不是人人都能想到的
Yeah, you don't come across that name too often.

793
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:29,510
不 但你的治疗 看上去是很普通的疗程
No, but in therapy you do. It's kinda common in therapy.

794
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,280
你知道"荧光棒"? 
You know a Glo stick?

795
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,510
对 我知道好吗?  实际上我就是她的治疗师
Yes, I do. Okay? In fact, I am her therapist.

796
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:37,250
但专业原因让我无法讨论
But professional reasons make it impossible for me to discuss

797
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,350
有关她的任何话题
anything whatsoever to do with her.

798
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,950
但她是个很好的女人
She's a very nice woman, however.

799
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:43,320
她有点神经质 而且有一些别的小问题
She's a little neurotic and she has got quite a few problems

800
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,920
并且需要接触她内心柔软的部分
and she needs to get in touch with her softer side.

801
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:48,490
但那...那是隐私 那是隐私 我是医生
But that's... That's private! That is private! I am a doctor.

802
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,430
医生不能讨论病人的私生活
Doctors do not discuss their patients' private lives.

803
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:54,630
要是我的下一个客人跑进来
How would you like it if I my next client walked in here

804
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,500
听到我说刚走出去的那个人
and I said that the guy that just walked out of here

805
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,370
是个痴迷于名叫"荧光棒"的 女人的变态怪胎会怎么想? 
Is a lunatic weirdo obsessed with a woman named Glo stick?

806
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,640
你会怎么想? 
How would you like that?

807
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,540
这...
Well...

808
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,980
顺便 我觉得不管这女孩多有魅力
And by the way, I don't think that this girl, however attractive,

809
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,750
都不值得你这样跪舔
is worth being obsessed about.

810
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,680
特别是不能用其他人的婚姻观来评判她
Especially for a married judge of other humans.

811
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,590
我不是有偏见 但这就是太愚蠢了
Now, I'm not judgmental, but that's just stupid!

812
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,420
是我 乔什 能借吗
<i>It's me, Josh. Can you pick up?</i>

813
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,720
看我这治疗师干得多棒
See what a good therapist I am?

814
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,730
那是我男朋友 而且我不打算接
That's my boyfriend and I'm not picking up.

815
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,880
这是你的专属时间
This is your private time.

816
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,030
我今晚要加班搞这部戏的工作 没法去吃晚饭了 真对不起
<i>So, I'm kind of stuck with the play tonight and I can't make it for dinner.</i>

817
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,000
什么意思? 你不能来吃晚饭是什么意思
What do you mean? What do you mean you can't make it to dinner?

818
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,310
行 你知道吗? 我饿死算了
Fine! You know what? I'll starve.

819
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,510
我以前就挨过饿 再挨饿算什么
I've starved before, I'll starve again.

820
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,710
最近我经常饿肚子
You know, I've been starving a lot myself lately.

821
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,480
也许我们可以一起挨饿呢
Perhaps we should starve together.

822
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,080
今晚愿意跟我一起吃晚饭吗? 
Would you care to have dinner with me tonight?

823
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,680
你平时都吃什么菜? 
What kind of food do you eat?

824
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,080
意大利菜你喜欢吗? 
Do you like italian?

825
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,920
还行
It's all right.

826
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,690
-那么?  -好吧
-So? -All right.

827
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,820
我去换个卫生棉
I'm going to change my tampon.

828
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,790
对不起 我只是不同意你的
I'm sorry, I just... I don't agree with you.

829
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:56,590
我觉得那个叫帕特森的女孩 就像赛斯说的 "无人能敌"
I just think that Patterson girl "nailed it," as Seth put it.

830
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,560
她身上有种别人都没有的感觉
I just think that there was something about her that nobody else had.

831
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,670
有种经验丰富的感觉 就好像她有过那种生活
Kind of an experienced quality. Almost like she'd lived it.

832
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,070
对 我得说 我同意德尔塔 和赛斯的说法
Yeah, I have to say, I agree with Delta and Seth.

833
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:08,010
她确实有些地方非常非常特别
I mean, she had something really, really special.

834
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:10,940
她让我想起了我在幼儿园 爱上的那个女孩
She reminds me of the girl that I fell in love with in kindergarten.

835
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,110
她是站街女吗
Was she a hooker?

836
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,050
对 她是幼儿园的站街女
Yeah, she was a kindergarten hooker.

837
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:16,410
这学校有点前卫啊
That sounds like a progressive school.

838
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,420
好了 珊迪 还有谁我们没讨论到
Okay, Sandy, who have we not discussed?

839
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,820
都说到了
You've covered it.

840
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,390
好的 那么不如今晚就到这 大家回去睡觉
Okay, well, why don't we call it a night and sleep on it.

841
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:26,590
不过那个伊莎
That Izzy, though,

842
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:29,390
我好像在哪见过她
I feel like I know her from somewhere.

843
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,930
她确实有张大众脸
Well, she did have one of those sort of ordinary faces

844
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,500
很多人都跟她长得像
that are a dime a dozen, so...

845
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,570
我不这么觉得
I don't think so.

846
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:38,540
那我咋知道 我现在饿得 都没法思考了
Well, what do I know? I'm so hungry I can't even think straight right now.

847
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,410
好 那就到此为止
Okay, looks like that's a wrap.

848
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,610
好
Okay.

849
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,540
你今天真是前所未有得美
You're looking more beautiful than ever.

850
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,450
我都等不及了 特别是床戏
I can't wait to do this... Especially the love scenes.

851
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:48,650
快走了
Get out of here.

852
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:49,980
谢谢你 导演先生
Well, thank you, Mr. Director,

853
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,020
真是个充满惊喜的第一天 对吧
that was a very surprising first day, wasn't it?

854
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,950
是的 所以我们才专门 跑到剧院来被惊喜
It sure was, yeah. That's why we go to the theater... To be surprised.

855
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,790
不过 你也许需要在明天
Incidentally, you might find a few more colors

856
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:00,090
你的表演力多拿出点色彩来
in your performance tomorrow in rehearsals.

857
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:02,090
不过今天干得不错 我们只是刚开始
But good job today. We're just beginning.

858
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,030
如果我太严厉了 对不起
Hey, sorry if I was a little snappy, darling.

859
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,730
不如咱们去吃个浪漫晚餐怎么样
But, why don't I make it up with a little romantic dinner?

860
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,050
请问需要什么 先生
Can I help you, sir?

861
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,750
一人的桌 要那边的
Table for one, over there.

862
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,090
这边请
This way, please.

863
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,590
嗨
Hi!

864
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,660
嗨
Hi.

865
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,130
真对不起我迟到了
I'm so sorry I'm late.

866
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:43,740
天啊 你没事吧
My God, are you all right?

867
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,000
没事 没事
It's all right, it's all right.

868
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,200
不不 我扶你起来
No, no... Let me get you up.

869
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,740
您要先来杯水吗
May I offer you some water?

870
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,540
-不 -威士忌加苏打? 
-No. -Scotch and soda?

871
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,480
-也许吧 -我去叫
-Maybe. -I'll look into it.

872
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,880
-谢谢 -很荣幸
-Thank you. -My pleasure.

873
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,120
真漂亮的饭店
Such a beautiful restaurant.

874
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,630
嗯哼
Ahem!

875
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,870
-你怎么了?  -没事 没事
-What's your problem? -Nothing, nothing...

876
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,540
只是渴了
I'm just... I was thirsty.

877
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,980
谢谢
Thank you.

878
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,680
你怎么回事? 
What is it with you?

879
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,650
我不知道我怎么了 只是太渴了
I don't know what's the matter with me. I'm just very thirsty.

880
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:38,120
那把杯子拿起来啊 别把杯子推下去
Well, then pick up the glass! Stop pushing it off the table.

881
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,130
你小时候肯定很任性
You must have been such a demanding child.

882
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:44,500
天啊 我饿死了
God, I'm just starving.

883
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,630
反正 就像我说的 我真受不了那些艺术家
Anyway, as I was saying, I'm just so sick of artists.

884
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,200
他们总是让你失望
They just always let you down.

885
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,570
给我个优秀的商人就行了
Just give me a great businessman.

886
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,540
跟这个剧作家约会 他们写喜剧
Dating this playwright... They write plays,

887
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,010
却根本不考虑生活 他们...
they don't think about life, they...

888
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:59,080
你有在听我的话吗
Are you listening to anything that I'm saying?

889
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,810
还有为什么藏在菜单后面
And why are you hiding behind that menu?

890
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,610
我没有
I'm not!

891
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,950
律师 好人 对 对
Lawyers, good people. Yes. Yes.

892
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:09,650
我只是得改变一下我的生活 我就是这个意思 我必须改变
I just have to change my life, that's all I can say. I have to.

893
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,130
你在看什么? 
What are you looking at?

894
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,660
我没看错吧? 
Is that who I think it is?

895
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,970
那王八蛋
That son of a bitch!

896
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,810
天啊 你没事吧? 
My gosh! Are you all right?

897
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:32,540
-没事 没事 -怎么今天一个个都倒了
-Yeah, yeah. -Everybody keeps falling down!

898
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,110
喔 真棒啊 我的治疗师
Wow, how great! Here's my therapist...

899
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,220
珍妮 听我说 你得...
Jane, look, you have to...

900
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,920
你被开除了
You're fired!

901
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,660
乔什
Josh!

902
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,960
你没事吧
Are you okay?

903
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,690
-没事 我没事 -你确定? 
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. -You sure?

904
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,290
-没事 -你认识她? 
-Yeah. -Do you know her?

905
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,660
是啊 我想我认识
Yeah, I guess I do.

906
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,770
别这么走啊
Don't just leave!

907
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:56,000
你也被开除了
You're fired, too!

908
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,040
看着点鹿
Watch where you're going!

909
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:01,110
你...
You...

910
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,850
我要去趟洗手间
I have got to go to the ladies room.

911
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,890
-你没事吧 儿子 -爸爸
-Are you all right, son? -Dad!

912
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,790
-你在这干什么?  -我在这工作
-What are you doing here? -I work here.

913
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:19,860
-什么时候开始的?  -说来话长
-From when? -It's a long story,

914
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,190
我们都没时间听故事
and neither of us has time for it.

915
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,160
一会见
I'll see you in a minute.

916
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,900
我去趟洗手间
I'm going to use the rest room.

917
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,040
珍妮 等等
Jane! Wait!

918
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:50,960
你好啊 完美试镜的美女
Well, hello, wonderful reading!

919
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,230
我只是呼吸点新鲜空气
I was just getting some air.

920
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:56,830
当然
Of course.

921
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,400
乔什 你在这干什么? 
Josh, what are you doing here?

922
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,400
阿诺德 嗨
Arnold. Hi.

923
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,170
德尔塔总是说这是个好地方
Delta always said this was a great place

924
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:05,870
-所以我就想来尝尝看 -是啊 是啊
-so I thought I'd try it. -Yeah, yeah.

925
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:08,270
我跟那个叫伊莎的女孩一起来的 他太让我震惊了
I'm here with that girl, Izzy. I was so impressed with her.

926
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,910
-她在这?  -对 在女厕所
-She's here? -Yeah. In the ladies room.

927
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,850
耶稣我了个基督啊
Dear God in heaven.

928
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:14,910
什么? 
What?

929
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:18,950
你怎么...
Why would you...

930
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:21,090
-法官 咱们去走走吧 -我不想走走
-Judge, let's take a little walk. -I don't want a little walk.

931
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:23,220
我要回去看看怎么回事
I'm going back in there and see what's going on!

932
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,820
现在不行 法官
Not right now, judge.

933
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,660
我听不懂你的话
Well, I can't follow anything you say.

934
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,760
我们现在就走
Let's not blow it now.

935
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,060
看看我在女厕所找到谁了
Look who I found in the ladies room.

936
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,300
-乔什 -啊
-Josh... -Yeah.

937
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,370
乔什跟我说了
Josh told me.

938
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:36,170
-你好吗 -很好 谢谢
-How are you? -I'm fine, thanks.

939
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:38,400
-你出手真快 乔什 -不 我只是...
-Fast moves, Josh. -No, I just...

940
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:40,970
你看过菜单了吗 阿诺德? 
Have you had a chance to look at the menu yet, Arnold?

941
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,870
还好我们的孩子爱他们的祖父母
Luckily, our kids love their grandparents,

942
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,680
不过今晚真的应该去接他们 对吧亲爱的? 
but we really should try to tuck them in tonight, right, darling?

943
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,180
我不太舒服 我还是先走吧
You know, I don't feel too good. I think I'm gonna go.

944
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,380
-不 -对不起
-No. -I'm sorry.

945
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,150
-好好照顾自己 -对
-Feel better. -Yeah.

946
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:53,350
照顾好自己
Feel better.

947
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:56,790
看看谁来了 稍等 迪米特里
Well, look whose here. One minute, Dmitri.

948
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:58,690
嘿 戈尔 居然是你
Hey, Glo! What do ya know?

949
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:03,190
你在跟我说话? 不 我是伊莎贝拉
You talking to me? No, I'm Isabella.

950
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,730
你们俩认识? 
You two know each other?

951
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:05,830
不 不熟
No. Not really.

952
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,470
对 我搞错了
Yeah, my mistake.

953
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:11,840
大伙儿都到了 开会呢这是
The gang's all here. Of all the gin joints...

954
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,910
德尔塔 你比上次在皮卡迪利大街
Delta, you look even younger now than you did that time in Piccadilly

955
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,940
跟那些孩子们玩的适合还更年轻 你记得吗? 
when you played with those children. Remember?

956
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:19,340
那次很开心 不是吗
That was fun, wasn't it?

957
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:22,750
很高兴见到你吗 但我真的该走了
It was really nice to see you all, but I gotta go.

958
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,450
-照顾好自己 -对
-Feel better. -Yes.

959
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:26,750
-明天见 -咱们去坐下 弗兰基
-See you tomorrow. -Let's sit down, Frankie.

960
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,460
阿诺德
Arnold,

961
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,720
弗兰基是薇琪的朋友
Frankie is friends with Vickie.

962
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,960
我不认识什么叫薇琪的
I don't know any Vickies.

963
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,990
我的错
My mistake.

964
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,730
-肯定是认错人了 -对
-Must be some other guy. -Yeah.

965
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:40,830
今晚好像大家都犯糊涂了 肯定是天气的问题
Everybody seems to be confused tonight! Must be the weather.

966
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:41,900
是啊
Yeah.

967
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,070
混乱之治
Confusion reigns.

968
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,200
早上见
See you in the morning.

969
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:48,040
晚安 甜美的公主
Good night, sweet princess.

970
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,310
再见
<i>Adieu.</i>

971
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:52,440
晚安
Good night.

972
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:53,810
再见
<i>Adieu.</i>

973
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,010
你为什么不喜欢那女孩? 
Why don't you like that girl?

974
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,850
-哪个女孩 -伊莎贝拉·帕特森
-Which girl? -Isabella Patterson.

975
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:01,050
谁说我不喜欢她? 
Who said I don't like her?

976
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,320
你在她身边就很奇怪
Well, you certainly act weird around her.

977
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,820
奇怪? 我都没怎么看过她
Act weird? I barely even looked at her.

978
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:07,790
没错
Exactly.

979
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:11,460
这也比跟我们的型男赛斯先生 搂搂抱抱要好
It's better, it's better than swooning over Mr. Seth Seduction.

980
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,370
我是说 他说的话加上你的动作 简直是最搞笑的东西
I mean, everything he says you act like it's the funniest thing you ever heard.

981
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:16,830
天啊 你总是吃醋
Pish-Tosh... You're always jealous.

982
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,070
为什么不管说什么最后都会 扯回到伦敦和皮卡迪利大街
Why is everything always back to London and Piccadilly?

983
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:22,510
还有你们的那段风光时刻
And this glorious time you guys had.

984
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:24,980
那部戏我们配合的很好 你知道的
We had a good time on that play, you know that.

985
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,780
对 我知道 对不起
No, I know. I'm sorry.

986
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,790
他们在那
There they are!

987
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:36,150
-法官 -什么
-Judge... -What?

988
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,920
很抱歉 但我得告诉你问题出现了
I'm sorry to tell you, but a problem has come up...

989
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,190
那是我儿子
That's my son.

990
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:43,060
那是你儿子? 
That's your son?

991
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:46,160
这里有些东西不符合犹太教义 这事情发生多久了? 
There's something not kosher here. How long has this been going on?

992
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:50,130
你说什么呢? 我半小时前 还什么都不知道
What are you talking about? I didn't know anything until half an hour ago,

993
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,540
如果你说的是这个
if that's what you're implying.

994
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,040
我闻到了老鼠
I smell a rat.

995
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,270
是吗? 我也是
Ha, you do? So do I!

996
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,510
-等等 等等 -我受够了被伤害
-Wait, wait, wait! -I'm tired of being abused.

997
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,150
希望你现在感觉好点了
I hope you're feeling better now.

998
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:03,580
我没事
Yeah, I'm okay.

999
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,580
但你呢 你什么都没吃
But you, you didn't get anything to eat.

1000
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:08,920
要不要进来吃个三明治? 
You want to come in and have a sandwich?

1001
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,920
好啊
-Sure. -Okay.

1002
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:14,230
该死的摔跤比赛
God damn wrestling match!

1003
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:15,560
能别抱怨了吗
Would you stop complaining?

1004
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,430
闭嘴 我都听不到电视了
Shut up! I can't hear the TV.

1005
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,200
你才闭嘴 去高速公路上玩去
You shut up! Go play on the highway!

1006
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,370
怎么了? 
What's normal?

1007
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:23,500
他是我认识的第一个编剧
He was the first playwright that I ever met.

1008
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,200
而且是个真正的绅士
And he was a true gentleman, you know?

1009
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:29,010
他都没想过亲我 即使我知道他很想
He didn't even try to kiss me, even when I knew he wanted to.

1010
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:31,310
他还说要见见我父亲
And, he asked to meet my father.

1011
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,340
从没人那么做过
And no one had ever done that before.

1012
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,410
我以前从没带男孩进过家门
I never even had a boy in the house before.

1013
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,920
不过...对 他完全就是 我想象中的编剧
But... Yeah, he was exactly what I imagined a playwright to be.

1014
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,390
非常敏感 而且他就像我的 玛丽琳的亚瑟·米勒
Very sensitive and, he was like the Arthur Miller to my Marilyn.

1015
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:50,860
三明治很好吃 谢谢
That was a great sandwich. Thanks.

1016
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:53,460
你没事吧? 你好像很伤心
Are you okay? You seem a little sad.

1017
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:56,930
没事 只是...
Yeah, it's just...

1018
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,870
我觉得可能我得不到那个角色
I don't think I'm gonna get the part.

1019
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:03,270
我觉得很有可能
I feel very optimistic about it.

1020
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,210
你真好
You're very sweet.

1021
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,510
我能给你打电话吗
May I call you?

1022
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,420
好啊
Yeah.

1023
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,390
当然 为什么不呢
Sure. Why not?

1024
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:18,990
谢谢你让我的戏更精彩
Well, thanks for making my play better.

1025
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:23,360
再见 乔什
So long, Josh.

1026
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,920
那个叫洛雷塔的女孩试镜还不错
That Loretta girl gave a fair reading...

1027
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,520
伊莎贝拉非常优秀
Isabella gave a brilliant one.

1028
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,420
你今天就要作出决定
You have to make a decision today.

1029
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:53,060
没有问题 没人说有问题
It's not a problem. No one said anything about a problem.

1030
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,330
-只是我得有个过程 好吗 -过程? 
-It's just that I have a process, okay? -A process?

1031
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:57,130
这个过程就从百吉饼开始
And the process begins with a bagel.

1032
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:00,630
-你只要按下扳机 -我吃饭不说话 亲爱的
-Pull the rigger, darling. -I'm eating in silence, honey.

1033
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:02,000
-来吧 -阿诺德
-Come on. -Arnold!

1034
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,540
去61大道和麦迪逊大街交叉口
We're going to go to 61st and Madison.

1035
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,410
天气真不错 对吧
Lovely day, isn't it?

1036
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:12,210
他很健谈 不是吗
Well, he's a talker, isn't he?

1037
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:13,680
他们给的百吉饼口味错了
They gave me the wrong bagels...

1038
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,310
我要的是罂粟籽的 他们给了我4个...
I asked for poppy seed. They gave me four...

1039
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,680
你今天心情不错啊
Boy, are you in a mood today!

1040
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,980
根本没人吃的东西
Which nobody eats.

1041
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:20,050
告诉我你为什么不喜欢她? 
Tell me why you don't like her?

1042
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:23,290
谁说我不喜欢她?  我只是不想仓促选择
Who said that I don't like her? I just don't want to make a snap decision.

1043
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:25,290
-仓促选择 -这太重要了 得一步步来
-A snap decision. -It's too important. It's my process.

1044
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:27,530
是谁总说你得有胆量
Who is the one who always says you have to go with your gut

1045
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:29,530
别瞻前顾后的? 
and not think about things too much?

1046
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:31,330
-可不是我说的 -那是直接饮用
-All right, not me. -That was a direct quote...

1047
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:32,230
我才不会那么说话
I don't talk like that.

1048
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:35,600
-我从没...谈过我的胆量 -你怎么回事? 
-I never... Talk about my gut. -What is wrong with you?

1049
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,500
我没事 只是压力太大
There's nothing wrong with me. I am under a great deal of pressure

1050
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,540
我不需要我妻子再给我增加 更多的压力
and I don't need my wife adding more pressure.

1051
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:42,670
你得承认 这女孩很不一样
You have to admit, there is something about this girl.

1052
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,510
也许她就是我们前世的守护神
Maybe she was a escort in a past life.

1053
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:47,310
-现在怎么又扯到前世了 -我不知道
-Now we're talking about past lives? -I don't know.

1054
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:49,480
怎么了? 司机哪去了? 
What's going on? Where's the driver?

1055
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:52,080
那是他吗? 
Is that him?

1056
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:55,020
对 是他 但他这是去哪? 
Yeah, that's him. But where's he going?

1057
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,360
他好像上出租了
He seems to be getting into a cab.

1058
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,220
这是我见过最扯淡的事情 什么...
This is the craziest thing I've ever seen. What...

1059
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,560
是我们说错什么了吗
Was it something we said?

1060
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,100
必须是啊
Apparently...

1061
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,600
要么是我们说错话了 要么是我们 就要被黑帮炸死了
Either that or it's a mob hit and we're about to blow up.

1062
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,370
下车 下车
Yeah, well, get out. Get out.

1063
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:13,270
这是什么啊 搞行为艺术的出租司机吗
What is this, like a existential cab driver.

1064
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:16,170
他好像受不了我们拌嘴
I think he couldn't take the tension between us.

1065
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,210
可能那就是他的过程
I know, maybe that was his process.

1066
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:20,110
好吧 我就把那该死的角色给她
Okay, I'll give her the goddamn part!

1067
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:21,750
这样就决定了? 
That's all it took?

1068
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:24,420
-对 -她欠那司机10美分
-Yeah. -She owes that cabbie ten percent.

1069
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,320
喂? 
Hello?

1070
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,390
珊迪? 
Sandy?

1071
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:33,660
你不是开玩笑吧? 
You're not kidding, are you?

1072
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:37,160
明天
Tomorrow.

1073
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,500
早上10点
10:00 A.M.

1074
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,430
好 太感谢了
Okay! Thank you so much!

1075
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:44,140
好 再见
Okay, bye now.

1076
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,100
-我得到角色了!  -什么角色? 
-I got the part! -What part?

1077
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:49,110
-百老汇!  -百老汇? 
-Broadway! -Broadway?

1078
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:50,710
你就是那么得到角色的? 
So that's how you got the part?

1079
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:52,110
他是那么告诉我的 对
That's what he told me, yeah.

1080
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:53,810
-你相信了他?  -对
-And you believed him? -Yeah!

1081
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:55,650
这挺有意思的
I think... It's kind of funny,

1082
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:58,120
但我真的想不出来你要怎么 编那么大一个故事
but I really don't see how you can make a story like that up.

1083
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,520
就跟你编个名字 或者瞒着妻子搞外遇那样
The same way you make up a name or cheat on your wife.

1084
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,750
他骗了你
He lied to you!

1085
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,460
我不知道我能不能接受你这说法
I don't know if I agree with you, actually.

1086
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,490
因为阿诺德跟我是在一个 非常特别的环境下认识的
Because Arnold and I met under very specific circumstances.

1087
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:10,090
而且他不欠我什么
And he didn't owe me anything.

1088
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,760
特别是不欠我真相
Especially not the truth.

1089
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,500
他完全没必要把那角色给我
And he certainly didn't have to give me that part.

1090
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,630
他肯定也不该给我
And he probably shouldn't have,

1091
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,130
这后来给他带来了那么多伤心事
for all the grief that it caused him.

1092
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:34,120
别叫 听我解释
Now, don't yell... Let me explain.

1093
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,320
不
Nope!

1094
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,490
不 不
No. No.

1095
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:37,720
不 出去
No. Get out!

1096
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,460
-我... -不
-I was... -No!

1097
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:42,130
你是我见过最恶劣的人之一
You are one of the most horrible people I've ever met...

1098
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:46,260
不 实际上 你知道吗 你就是我 见过的最恶劣的人
No, in fact, you know what, you are the most horrible person I have ever met.

1099
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:50,500
你推掉我们的晚饭就为了 跟我的病人一起吃饭? 
You cancel our dinner to go out with one of my sick patients.

1100
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,700
你知不知道这只让我感到 你是多么恶心
Do you know that only tells me how sick you are!

1101
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,510
天啊 我只想把这个捅进你的蛋蛋里
God, I just want to shove this up your cock!

1102
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:58,710
珍妮 看在上帝的份上 这都是为了我的戏
Jane, for God's sake, it all has to do with my play.

1103
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:00,480
你的戏? 
Your play?

1104
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,410
我才不在乎你的什么戏
I don't care about your play!

1105
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,720
你愚蠢的戏剧 我也不在乎你
Your stupid little play, I don't care about you.

1106
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,220
给我滚
Just get out!

1107
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:08,490
不
No.

1108
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:10,790
-喂?  -你好大的胆子 在我的办公室
-Hello? -How dare you answer your cellphone

1109
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:12,360
接电话! 
in my office!

1110
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,790
太好了 我真为你感到高兴
That's great! I'm so happy for you.

1111
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:16,630
现在你又开心了
And now you're happy.

1112
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:19,530
现在他开心了 跟我在一起 你总是苦瓜脸 为什么? 
Now he's happy. You're always depressed with me. Why is that?

1113
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:20,830
为什么? 那是谁? 
Why is that? Who is that?

1114
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:23,170
我现在不方便说话 一会再打给我
I can't talk right now. Call me later.

1115
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:25,140
是那个金发疯婆子吗
Was that the crazy blond?

1116
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,370
还是那个饥渴的老爹? 
Or the needy father?

1117
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:28,210
珍妮 我必须跟你谈谈
Jane, I must talk to you!

1118
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:31,310
天啊 你知道吗 我看到你们俩就恶心 都给我滚
God, you know what? I'm so sick of both of you. Just get out!

1119
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,340
你们俩 滚
All of you, get out!

1120
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:35,450
滚出去
Just get out!

1121
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:36,810
好
Okay.

1122
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,880
出去
Out!

1123
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:43,490
真受不了这么紧的衣服
I'm sick of these tight clothes.

1124
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:45,490
我得换身宽松的
I've gotta get a loose-fitting suit or something.

1125
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:47,190
不然就去做个抽脂手术
Either that or it's liposuction.

1126
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:49,590
你身材这么好 得了便宜还卖乖
Come on, you look great. You're fishing for compliments.

1127
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,730
-别说啦 -你这乖卖的太大了
-Stop it! -Harpooning is more like it.

1128
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:54,570
嘿 两位陌生人 你们在这干啥呢
Hey, you two strangers, what are you doing here?

1129
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:56,930
我知道你在这干什么
Well, I know what you're doing here.

1130
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,570
升职 升职
Promotion, promotion.

1131
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:00,340
-升职了 -嗨
-Promoting. -Hi.

1132
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:01,940
这是切切 我的女公关
This is Cece, my P.R. Lady.

1133
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:04,510
我是西蒙斯小姐 你们能不能 考虑一下帮我们做个广告? 
Miss Simmons, would you consider doing a commercial for us?

1134
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:06,910
当然你可以负责导演 西蒙斯先生
And of course you can direct it, Mr. Simmons.

1135
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:08,610
叫我艾伯森就好 谢谢
It's Albertson. Thank you.

1136
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:10,610
-我好像弄错了 -估计是
Well, I guess I blew that one. I guess you did.

1137
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,420
谢谢 其实我不接广告
Thank you, but I don't really do commercials.

1138
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:14,690
一向不做
Not my thing.

1139
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:16,720
你要不要去找几件宽松的衣服? 
Did you want to find some large clothes?

1140
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,490
我只是说别这么紧的
I said less tight...

1141
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:20,520
对 更放松一点或者宽大的衣服在这边
Yeah, but no, the relaxed or the more looser fitting are over here.

1142
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,630
很高兴认识你
Nice to meet you.

1143
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:23,530
回头见 赛斯
We'll see you, Seth.

1144
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:25,660
再见 伙计们
See you later, guys.

1145
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,230
天啊
My God.

1146
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:29,470
-你急什么呢 -这东西看着就不咋地
-What's the rush? -This stuff doesn't look good,

1147
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:31,640
太贵了 咱们去个好点的地方
and it's too expensive. Let's go some place nice.

1148
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,570
香奈儿或者普拉达什么的
Like, like Chanel or Prada.

1149
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:35,370
那儿反而廉价了吗
That's bargain basement.

1150
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:38,410
我感觉我有幽闭恐惧症 在这里快要没法呼吸了
I feel like I'm claustrophobic, I can hardly breathe in here...

1151
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:40,640
-看 我爱花呢 -让我害怕
-Look! I love tweed. -Freaking me out...

1152
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:43,480
我要试试这件
I'm going to try this on.

1153
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,780
好 来 我来帮你 我也爱花呢衣服
Okay, here, come on, I'll help you. I love tweed, too.

1154
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:47,350
阿诺德 我不需要你帮忙
Arnold, I don't need your help.

1155
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:48,920
你确定? 来让我看看
Are you sure? Here, let me watch.

1156
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,520
等到了家也许你能看我脱掉
At home, maybe you can watch me take it off.

1157
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,860
放松点 牛仔
Take it easy, cowboy.

1158
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:58,000
我知道 但我可以看看你 穿上好不好看啊
I know, but I'm a good judge of you in tweed.

1159
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,560
我知道 但有时候...
I know, but sometimes it's like...

1160
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:11,680
《爱你就捧你》
Squirrels to the nuts!

1161
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,280
你没事吧
Are you okay?

1162
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,810
真没想到居然碰到你了 德里克
I cannot believe I'm running into you, Derek!

1163
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,680
不 我才不安静
No, I'm not going to be quiet.

1164
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,620
我是玛姬 记得吗? 芝加哥的
It's Margie, remember? From Chicago!

1165
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:22,520
我到处找你啊
I've looked everywhere for you.

1166
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,960
你不明白 你改变了我的生命
You don't understand, you've changed my life.

1167
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,930
我去了时尚学校 我现在是这儿的采购商
I went to fashion school and I'm the executive buyer here...

1168
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:29,530
-除此之外... -别说了
-Besides that... -Shut up...

1169
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:31,260
你给了我这辈子最棒的一晚
You gave me the single best night I've ever had!

1170
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:32,760
在床上床下都是
In bed and out.

1171
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,370
都是因为你和《爱你就捧你》
And it's all because of you and the Squirrels To The Nuts!

1172
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:36,870
求你小声点
Please keep your voice down!

1173
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:38,570
好了伙计们 下次见
Okay, see you later, guys.

1174
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:39,940
天啊 赛斯·吉尔伯特
My God, Seth Gilbert!

1175
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:41,410
你们是朋友吗 阿诺德
So, you guys friends, Arnold?

1176
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:42,910
你这说啥呢 赛斯
Where are you going with this, Seth?

1177
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:44,710
你们俩注意点形象 好吗
Now you two behave yourselves, okay?

1178
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:46,340
还有什么你需要的吗? 
Is there anything else you need?

1179
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,480
《爱你就捧你》 嗯? 
"Squirrels To The Nuts,"

1180
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,280
你这混蛋 畜生
you weasily, no good son of a bitch!

1181
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:54,790
你别再出现在我面前
Don't you ever, ever speak to me again!

1182
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:56,550
德尔塔 不 德尔塔! 
Delta, no! Delta...

1183
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,590
赛斯 等等
Seth, wait!

1184
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:10,300
我记下车牌了 肯定能找到
I got the license plate! Easy to trace.

1185
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,840
别担心 让我来 我都付钱
No, no, don't worry. I'll take care of it. I'll pay for everything.

1186
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,940
她是我老婆 只是赶时间
She's my wife, she was just in a hurry.

1187
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,540
对 她有个会要迟到了 而且脑子有点不正常
Yes, she's a little late for a meeting and she's a little scattered-brained.

1188
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:19,310
神经有点大条
Just absent-minded.

1189
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:21,050
布拉德 没事 我认识他 让他处理吧 相信我
Brad, it's okay. I know him. He's good for it. Believe me.

1190
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:22,380
好吧 好吧
Okay, okay.

1191
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,780
叫你老婆下次小心点 兄弟
Tell your wife to be more careful, Bub.

1192
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25,620
我会更小心点
I will... More careful.

1193
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,920
听我说 德里克 阿诺德 不管你叫什么
Look, Derek... Arnold... Whatever your name is.

1194
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,560
我知道我太大声了 我只是看到你太激动
I know I was speaking too loud. I was just so excited to see you.

1195
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,490
-没事 -你要现金 支票还是传票? 
-It's okay... -Cash, check or charge?

1196
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:37,330
那女孩干什么的? 站街女? 
So what is that girl, a hooker?

1197
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:38,760
就跟你带去尼克饭店那个一样? 
Like the one you came to Nick's with?

1198
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,030
可能
Could be.

1199
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:41,970
应召女 三陪
Call girl. Escort.

1200
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:45,340
那有什么区别? 反正都是 服务你内裤里那点东西
What's the difference? They all escort you in and out of their pants.

1201
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:46,800
男人啊
Men!

1202
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,540
对 你说得对 我们只擅长一件事
Yeah, you're right. We're only good for one thing.

1203
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:52,380
那要不要来一发? 
So how about some?

1204
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,780
-我在考虑 -我还记得伦敦 德尔塔
-I'm considering it! -I still remember London, Delta.

1205
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:56,750
在那之后我再也没找到过那种感觉
I haven't felt that way since.

1206
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:58,650
得了吧 赛斯
Come on, Seth.

1207
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:01,820
你知道我们都太熟悉 现在已经找不到感觉了
You know we were both too far down other roads for us to get serious.

1208
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:04,360
你才是 我能很快就改变方向
You were. I would've switched direction in a second.

1209
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,920
我知道 你已经变了很多方向了
I know. You've switched a bunch of since then.

1210
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:08,060
-对于你就不一样了 -拜托...
-It was different with you. -Come on...

1211
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,790
我依然准备好了 德尔
I'm still ready, del.

1212
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:12,030
到地方了 吉尔伯特先生
This is it, Mr. Gilbert.

1213
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:13,800
-这一次你要推销什么?  -我的新古龙水
-What are you promoting this time? -My new cologne.

1214
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,370
别告诉我叫什么名字
Don't tell me what it's called.

1215
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:16,770
其实他们想出了一个 非常好的名字
They came up with a pretty good name, actually.

1216
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:17,940
"赛斯的诱惑"
"Seth's Seduction."

1217
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,570
很好...
Great...

1218
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:23,870
吉尔伯特先生 你来了真是太好了
Mr. Gilbert, it is so wonderful to have you here!

1219
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,810
大家都等不及想见您了
Everybody's been dying to meet you in the flesh.

1220
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:27,510
-你说什么?  -他在戏弄你
-I beg your pardon? -He's teasing you.

1221
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:32,620
-德尔塔 跟上 跟上 -我在努力
-Delta, keep up! Keep up! -I'm trying.

1222
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,950
借过
Excuse me.

1223
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,890
能给我们签名吗? 
Can we have your autograph?

1224
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:42,460
我们已经等了四个 小时了 只耽误你一会儿
We waited four hours in line, it'll only take you a second.

1225
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:45,800
我会赶上你的 我在后面
I'm trying to get to you. I'm behind here.

1226
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,730
好的 女士 不能进去了
Okay, lady, the jig's up.

1227
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:53,070
你做什么... 等等 赛斯 赛斯
What are you... Wait! Seth! Seth!

1228
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:56,410
看来她不满意 你想要进去吗? 
Well, she ain't a pro. What, you came back for more?

1229
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:57,810
光偷衣服不够吗? 
The suit wasn't enough?

1230
00:56:57,810 --> 00:56:59,640
不 我不是从这偷的
No, I didn't steal this from here.

1231
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,950
-那是从哪偷的?  -不 我根本没偷东西
-Where did you steal it from? -No, I didn't steal it at all.

1232
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:04,010
我在店里和丈夫吵了一场
I got into an argument with my husband at Barney's

1233
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,920
然后不知怎么出去了 你应该给他们打电话
and I walked out by accident. You should call them.

1234
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,020
他的名字叫阿诺德·艾伯森 现在肯定已经付钱了
His name is Arnold Albertson, I'm sure he's paid for it by now.

1235
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,690
能请你们放我下来吗? 
Could you please put me down?

1236
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:11,190
好的 女士 我会放你 下来 你是个白痴
All right, lady, I'll put you down. You're an idiot.

1237
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:13,760
我们听过很多说辞 但你这个是最傻的
We hear a lot of stories, but this one tops them all.

1238
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,090
"我和丈夫在店里吵架
"I had an argument with my husband at Barney's

1239
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,600
所以我来这里 偷另一件衣服"
so I came over to Macy's to steal another suit."

1240
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,530
不 你不明白 我根本没偷东西
No, you don't understand. I didn't steal this at all!

1241
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:23,100
喂? 
Yes. Hello?

1242
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,170
什么? 谁? 
What? Who?

1243
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:27,770
警察? 你说什么呢? 
The police? What are you talking about?

1244
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:31,640
什么 你疯了吗?  是的 请让她接电话
What, are you crazy? Yes, put her on the phone, please!

1245
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,010
阿诺德? 你最好把我弄出去
Arnold? You better get me the hell out of here

1246
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:35,580
然后送我去我父母那
and over to my parents' apartment!

1247
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,210
我最好在二十分钟内出去
And I better get there within the next 20 minutes!

1248
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,020
你最好确定在我到那里的时候
And you better make damn sure that you're out of the apartment

1249
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:40,820
你已经走了
before I get there!

1250
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:42,990
我建议你自己去 宾馆里开个房间
And what I suggest you do is get yourself a hotel room, buddy,

1251
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:44,720
然后再找一个应召女
and order another call girl!

1252
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,790
你真他妈的傻
Squirrels to the fucking nuts!

1253
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:02,810
独角兽 其实是女性的一种象征
The unicorn, you see, was a kind of symbol of women.

1254
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:05,880
这一象征是女人被人像 动物那样对待时候产生的
And this comes from a period when women were treated like Chattel.

1255
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,480
像牛那样? 
Like Cattle?

1256
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,910
不 是动物
No, Chattel.

1257
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:12,020
意思是她们得按照男人 的想法去生活
It basically means they were whatever men wanted them to be.

1258
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:14,250
你是说就像现在的 大多数女性一样? 
You mean, like now a lot?

1259
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:16,050
我想是的
Yeah, I guess.

1260
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:18,620
那是我写剧本的原因之一
Part of that's why I wrote the play.

1261
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:23,530
你知道 在很古老的时候 妓女是个神圣的职业
You know, in really ancient times, the prostitute was a sacred profession.

1262
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:25,060
具体是什么时候? 
When was this?

1263
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:29,270
在精神和性欲分开之前
Well, before spirituality and sexuality were split apart.

1264
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:30,900
其实不应如此
They really shouldn't be.

1265
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:31,970
是的
Yeah.

1266
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:36,540
你是个很浪漫的人
You're a real romantic guy, aren't you?

1267
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:39,680
我想乔什在我身上 看到了些什么
I guess Josh saw something in me.

1268
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,850
和阿诺德不一样
And it wasn't really like Arnold.

1269
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:44,250
你知道 阿诺德和我一样 把钱看得很重
You know, with Arnold, the money was as much for him as it was for me.

1270
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:51,290
但是乔什 我认为他是 第一个相信我的人
But with Josh, I think he was the first person who ever believed in me.

1271
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:53,860
所以自然的 一些过去 认识的人
<i>So, of course, cue somebody from my past</i>

1272
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,790
就会出现毁了我的好事
<i>who's going to show up and ruin the whole damn picture.</i>

1273
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,800
你为什么让我心碎? 
Why are you breaking my heart?

1274
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,830
你难道不知道你伤了我的心
Don't you understand you're breaking my heart,

1275
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:03,700
伊莎...戈尔... 不管你叫什么名字
Izzy... Glo... Whatever your name is.

1276
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,670
-法官也是有感情的 -先生
-Judges have feelings, too. -Mister!

1277
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:08,770
我不认为我们现在 适合讨论这样的话题
I don't think we're in exactly the best place to have this conversation.

1278
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:11,880
所以我建议你转身 回到你之前的地方去
So I suggest you turn around and go right back where you came from.

1279
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,540
我建议你闭上你的嘴
And I suggest that you shut your trap!

1280
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,080
我在和这位女士说话...
I am talking to the lady...

1281
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,750
这个伤了我心的妓女
The lady of the night over here who broke my heart.

1282
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,080
我联系了薇琪的 援交服务 结果第二天...
I call Vickie's escort service and the next day...

1283
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,560
-乔什 你做什么?  -爸爸? 
-Josh, what are you doing? -Dad?

1284
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,720
他是个老年人
He's an old man.

1285
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,630
-是的 下流的老头子 -你说的不对
-Yeah, a dirty old man! -That is irrelevant.

1286
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:31,230
好的 好的 有时候下流 但是不老
Okay, okay. Dirty sometimes, but not old!

1287
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:35,000
我的老天 约书亚 你知道 你惹上什么事了吗? 
For God's sake, Joshua, do you realize what you're getting yourself into?

1288
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,700
这位女士和你的导演 共度过美好一夜
This lady had a night with your director!

1289
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,640
我得说是一个很浪漫的夜晚
A perfectly romantic one, I should say.

1290
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:43,870
伊莎贝拉 等等
Isabella! Wait!

1291
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,780
伊莎贝拉
Isabella!

1292
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:51,950
乔什知道这件事对于你来说 肯定感觉很难过
It must have been really hard for you, Josh finding out like that.

1293
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:57,220
遭遇到双人包夹 他还有三秒钟时间...
<i>Double team him now, he's got three seconds to get out of...</i>

1294
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:59,890
你去哪了 亲爱的?  一直有人打电话找你
Where ya been honey? The phone's been ringing off the hook for you!

1295
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:02,130
一整天电话都响个不停
All day long! That's too many calls!

1296
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:05,230
-有约书亚...珊迪和阿尔弗雷德 -又来了
-That Joshua... Sandy and Alfred... -Again.

1297
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:06,900
是谁? 
What now?

1298
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,200
一个叫德里克的
A Derek.

1299
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:11,800
喂? 
Hello?

1300
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,770
伊莎 我是阿诺德 我想马上见你
Izzy, it's Arnold. I need to see you right away.

1301
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:16,770
你能到巴克利来吗 还是同一个房间 1369号
Can you come over to the barclay, same room. 1369.

1302
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,740
我会解释一切 去那见我
<i>I'll explain everything. Just meet me here.</i>

1303
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,210
我不知道我是否能去
I don't know if I can do that.

1304
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:23,180
你说那话是什么意思? 
What do you mean you don't know if you can do that?

1305
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:27,780
我们得排练 你就赶紧过来吧
We gotta rehearse! Just, just, just get over here.

1306
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,320
现在 比赛进入白热化了
<i>Now, they're all five in the ring...</i>

1307
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:30,920
好的
Okay.

1308
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:34,220

1309

Yeah. Yeah, tonight.

1310
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:38,130
巴克利酒店 晚上八点 老样子
The barclay. 8:00 P.M. Under the usual name.

1311
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:40,700

到底怎么回事?  你知道究竟怎么回事吗? 
What is it all about? Do you have any idea what's going on?

1399
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,310
我不需要马桶
I don't need to use your toilet.

1400
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,980
你不需要用马桶
You don't need to use my toilet.

1401

1402
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:32,320

Well, then I guess if you don't need to use the toilet...

1403
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,990
拜托 别再说马桶了
Please, stop saying toilet!

1404
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:36,490

德尔塔...德尔塔 亲爱的 听着 不是你想的那样

好的 谢谢薇琪
Okay, thanks Vickie.

1412
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:22,070
德尔塔 这是个误会
Delta, it was a misunderstanding.

1413
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:23,410
她不应该来我房间的
She wasn't supposed to come to my room.

1414
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:25,540
拜托 赛斯 你说谎的 功夫比那好的
Come on, Seth. You can do better than that.

1415
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:28,510
既然我知道你要来 为什么还找她 这说不通啊
Why would I have you come over with her? It doesn't make any sense!

1416
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:31,380
那姑娘要用厕所... 她吓坏了 我不明白
The girl needed to use the bathroom... She got scared. I don't know!

1417

女士 是我的错
Lady, it's my fault.

1418

-You see? I told you. -I still don't believe you.

1421
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,230
你喜欢你的炮友 跟我丈夫一样
You love your hookers, too. Just like my husband.

1422
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:50,100
不 这是因为我得不到你 而他能得到你
No, it's because I can't have you. He has you.

1423
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,170
没人能得到我
Nobody has me.

1424

1431
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:25,070
楼下 你来这里做什么? 
Downstairs? What are you doing here?

1432
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:28,710
我还以为....不不不 是的 我很开心你来了
I thought... No, no, no. Yes, I'm happy to hear from you.

我的天...
My God...

1436
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:37,250
为什么叫她直接上来? 
Why'd you tell her to come up here?

1437
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:39,220
现在是红色警戒 明白我的意思吗? 
We're in a code red, do you understand what that means?

1438
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:41,220
一阵暴风坐着电梯上来了
We have a tornado coming up the elevator

1439
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:43,150
很快就要到这里了
and it's about to touch down here.

1440
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,120
现在你得离开这 我们得把你...
Now you've got to go. We're gonna put you...

1441

Hi, honey.

1445
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:01,700
阿诺德 你这样多久了? 
Arnold, how long have you been doing this?

1446
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:03,840
-什么?  -做你正在做的
-Doing what? -Doing what you've been doing.

1447
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:06,080
很明显 你不止做过一次
Obviously, you've done it more than once.

1448
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,440
所谓的"松鼠与坚果"
This whole "Squirrels To The Nuts" thing

1449
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:10,380
很明显是你自己的算盘
is obviously your own special little bit.

1450
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:12,420
我还以为这只是 我们的事情 阿诺德
I thought it was just ours, Arnold.

1451
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:15,720
你说这样做是为了 帮助我度过职业生涯的艰难时期
Something you said to help me get through a difficult time in my career.

1452
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:18,250
显然你把这个当做 是你的掩护
Evidently you've been using it as some kind of seduction,

1453
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:22,160
当做是一个诱饵 来引一些人上钩
a kind of lure, a kind of a general serenade for whoever wants to listen.

1454
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,130
德尔塔 亲爱的 这个可要比 那个复杂一些
Delta, darling, it's more complicated...

1455
01:08:24,130 --> 01:08:26,360
那就看着我的眼睛 告诉我到底怎么回事? 
Than meets the eye, yes, I'm sure. Well please, tell me. What is it?

1456
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,230
为了你的新作品做研究? 
Research for some wonderful new play you're planning?

1457
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:29,700
也许是新的电影? 
Some new film, perhaps?

1458
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:32,640
某方面来说是的 我想做一个女性故事
Well, in a way, yes. I'm touched by women's stories.

1459
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,140
显然是
Apparently!

1460
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:36,540
不 这是... 我是主张男女平等的
No, it's... I'm sort of a feminist...

1461
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:38,240
是的 当然
Yeah, sure.

1462
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:41,240
那样说也许不对 但是在精神上意识到
That's not the right word, but kind of a mental aware...

1463
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:45,320
你身上的香水味 真奇怪 阿诺德
Odd perfume you're wearing, Arnold.

1464
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,320
最近来了一点 "松鼠与坚果"? 
Had a little "Squirrels To The Nuts" up here lately?

1465
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,890
你说什么呢? 不 我...
What are you talking about? No! I...

1466
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:56,690
我不相信
I don't believe this.

1467
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:00,430
一晚上来两次? 
Twice in a night?

1468
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:02,830
德尔塔 德尔塔 德尔塔 不要开门
Delta. Delta. Delta, don't open the door.

1469
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:08,770
德尔塔 不是你想的那样
Delta, it's not what you think it is.

1470
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:11,810
他说的对 你知道 真的不是你想的那样
He's right, you know. It... It's really not.

1471
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:14,240
好的 知道吗?  这一个还更蹩脚
Okay, you know what? This is the Topper!

1472
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:17,150
现在该我走了
And now comes my exit.

1473
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:19,820
离开这里
Out of the room,

1474
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:21,480
离开旅馆
out of the hotel,

1475
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:23,290
告别这戏剧
out of this play,

1476
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:27,220
告别我的生活
out of my life!

1477
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,430
祝你们两好运
Good luck to you both!

1478
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:33,560
德尔塔 停下 等等
Delta, stop! Wait!

1479
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:34,830
德尔塔 德尔塔
Delta! Delta!

1480
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:36,670
我不想再听任何话
I don't wanna hear anything more! Ever!

1481
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:38,740
不是看起来的那样
It's not what it looks like!

1482
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:41,700
说实话这不是我第一次 看见伊莎
Well, it's not exactly first time I've seen Izzy leave Arnold's room,

1483
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:43,940
-离开阿诺德的房间 -真有趣
-to be honest, sorry. -How interesting.

1484
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:47,340
看起来所有人都知道怎么回事
It seems that everybody in the entire world knew what was going on

1485
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,550
除了我
except for me.

1486
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:50,310
-我真傻 我真傻 -你不傻
-Stupid, stupid me. -You're not stupid.

1487
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:52,680
真高兴看到你们这群人 在危机时刻团结在一起
So glad you boys stick together in a time of crisis.

1488
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:54,880
赛斯 你在这里做什么?  你总是这样
Seth, what are you even doing here? You're always lurking.

1489
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:57,390
你还是跟着你的围巾 和小狗流浪去吧
Just loitering there, with your scarves and your little dog.

1490
01:09:57,390 --> 01:09:58,920
不要管这件事
Just stay out of it!

1491
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,790
你才是疯子 放着 这么好的妻子不管
You're the lunatic, chasing dames with a wife like this.

1492
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:02,530
看起来男人们都 是喜欢美女的 赛斯
It seems all men like chasing dames, Seth.

1493
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:05,400
不 西蒙斯太太 他只是试着帮忙
No, miss Simmons, he was just trying to help.

1494
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,930
你知道 他改变了我的生活 他给了我三万美金
You know, he changed my life. He gave me $30,000

1495
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:11,200
今天我有了我的 第一间公寓
and today I got my first apartment.

1496
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,900
-他做了什么?  -三万美金? 
-He what? -Thirty thousand dollars? U.S.?

1497
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:16,240
-是的 -我再也受不了了
-Yeah. -I can't handle any more!

1498
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:17,910
一晚上三万美金?  你的功夫肯定挺好
For one night? You must be good.

1499
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:20,410
不不不 你不明白
No, no, no, you don't understand...

1500
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:21,510
我只是试着...
I was trying...

1501
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:22,850
你高兴了? 
You happy?

1502
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:25,450
你怎么能这样武断
Where do you get the right to be so judgmental!

1503
01:10:25,450 --> 01:10:28,520
听着 伙计 你不会想和我 打的 我能揍扁你
Listen, mate! You don't want to fight me, I'll kick the shit out of you!

1504
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,390
-我是受过伦敦街头训练的 -是吗? 
-Trained on the streets of London! -Really?

1505
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:32,660
你说的伦敦是七年前 勾引我妻子的伦敦吗? 
Is that the same London where you seduced my wife, seven years ago?

1506
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:34,890
根本不是那么回事 她爱的是你
Nothing of the sort at all. She loved you!

1507
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:36,460
我都不知道为什么
Not that I can see why or how!

1508
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:38,930
为什么? 也许是因为 我是好人 而且我喜欢...
Why? Maybe because I'm a good guy and I like...

1509
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:40,760
-喜欢妓女 -是的 没错
-Who likes hookers! -Yeah. Checkmate!

1510
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:43,300
因为我不完美 知道吗?  但你也一样
Because I'm not perfect, okay? Neither are you!

1511
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:45,540
天啊 这是浪费时间 这是浪费时间
Jesus Christ, this is a waste of time. It's a waste of time!

1512
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:46,840
我要去睡觉了 好吗? 
I'm going to go to sleep now, okay?

1513
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,810
困了 困了
Tired! Tired!

1514
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:50,740
我只能说在早上
All I can say is that in the morning

1515
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:54,340
和你一起合作还是很愉快的
it's going to be a distinct pleasure working with you, Arnold.

1516
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:57,580
-是的 你的房间在这边 -我知道
-Yeah. Your room's over here! -I knew that!

1517
01:10:57,580 --> 01:11:00,280
有些时候的夜晚当你回到家
<i>There were those nights when you get home</i>

1518
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:01,920
没人好联系
<i>and there's no one to call.</i>

1519
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,420
没有剩下的酒可以喝
<i>And there's no vodka left to drink.</i>

1520
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:08,590
除了一些商业广告外 也没什么好看的节目
And you got nothing on TV apart from those stupid infomercials.

1521
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:13,000
你就一个人呆着
And you're stuck with yourself.

1522
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,470
那就是人们所说的恐怖的意思
And that's what they mean when they say the word terror.

1523
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:19,040
因为我只想沉浸在 某个人的怀抱里
Because all I wanted was to be wrapped up in somebody's arms.

1524
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,940
任何人的怀抱里
Anybody's arms.

1525
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:23,810
即使是陌生人也行
Even a stranger's.

1526
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:28,750
我讨厌孤独
I hate... I hate being alone.

1527
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:31,910
但是当我孤独的时候 我会看着镜子
But when I am, I look into the mirror

1528
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,550
然后跟我自己说 奥黛丽·赫本说过的话
and I tell myself something that Audrey Hepburn once said...

1529
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:40,760
"我相信粉红色
"I believe in pink.

1530
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:44,690
我相信微笑是最好 的减肥方式
"I believe that laughter is the best calorie burner.

1531
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:48,060
我相信吻
"I believe in kissing.

1532
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:50,070
经常吻
"Kissing a lot.

1533
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:53,500
我相信坚强
"I believe in being strong

1534
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:57,770
即使周围的一切看来不对
"even when everything around you seems to be going wrong.

1535
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:03,380
我相信快乐的女孩 是最美的
"I believe that happy girls are the prettiest girls.

1536
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:07,350
我相信明天是新的一天
"And I believe that tomorrow is another day.

1537
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:11,390
我相信奇迹"
And I believe in miracles!"

1538
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,690
我相信奇迹
I believe in miracles.

1539
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:19,400
你知道 那是...
You know, that...

1540
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:23,700
那办法每次都有用
That works every single time.

1541
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:31,110
嘿 伊莎贝拉 谢天谢地
Hey, Isabella. Thank God.

1542
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:33,780
我昨晚一直打你的电话 但是你没接
I was trying to call you all night last night, you didn't pick up your phone.

1543
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:35,410
我真的不知道该做什么
I didn't really know what to do.

1544
01:12:35,410 --> 01:12:37,480
你知道 我想我只是来这里
You know, I figured I'd just show up.

1545
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,420
-早上好 乔什 伊莎 -嘿
-Morning Josh. Izzy. -Hey.

1546
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:41,480
-睡得怎么样 亲爱的?  -不好
-How did you sleep, darling? -Not good.

1547
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:43,450
不要让它影响你
Don't let it get ya down!

1548
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:45,920
好的 我们开始吧 今天不能浪费时间
Okay, let's start right in. We don't want to waste any time today.

1549
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,090
人都到齐了吗? 
Is everybody here?

1550
01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:48,960
是的 除了德尔塔都到了
Yeah, everybody but Delta.

1551
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,530
那就不是到齐了
Well, then, everybody's not here!

1552
01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:52,060
你说除了德尔塔都 到齐了是什么意思? 
What do you mean, "Yeah, everybody but Delta?"

1553
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:54,760
你应该说"除了德尔塔都来了"
You mean, "Everybody but Delta", you leave out the "Yeah."

1554
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:56,500
除了德尔塔都来了 先生
Everybody's here but Delta, sir.

1555
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,100
好的 别叫我先生 珊迪
Okay, don't call me sir, Sandy.

1556
01:12:58,100 --> 01:12:59,770
好的 我们就先开始吧
All right, we're going to start without her.

1557
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:01,600
我们先坐下读剧本吧
Let's just sit down and have a table-read.

1558
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:03,370
大家早上好
Good morning, everybody!

1559
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:04,770
我想我们先读剧本吧
I assume we're starting with a reading.

1560
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:06,260
是的 我正要说这个
Yes, that's what I was just saying.

1561
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:07,740
-我想也许我们可以坐下来... -好的
-I thought maybe we'd just sit down... -Fine!

1562
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,610
我们开始之前先 讲些事情
Let me just say something here before we get started.

1563
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:38,710
听着 我们都是专业人员
Look, we're all professionals here.

1564
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:41,640
但那并不意味着我们的 私生活就没问题
Which isn't to say that we don't have problems in our private lives

1565
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:43,750
当然偶尔会有问题
from time to time. Of course we do.

1566
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:47,850
但是我们之所以专业 就是因为我们不会让这些问题
But what makes us professionals is that we don't let those problems

1567
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:49,890
干涉我们的工作
slop over into our work.

1568
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:55,530
我们不在工作的时候 谈论那些问题
And we can't talk about them in any way, shape or form.

1569
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:57,660
把它加入到你的表演中 成为催化剂
Use it for your performance, let it fuel that,

1570
01:13:57,660 --> 01:14:01,960
但是可不能被它们分心了
But don't let it distract you from our purpose here.

1571
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:05,170
当然这样的一套陈词滥调
Which is, of course, that old show business cliche,

1572
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:07,100
是我深信不疑的
which I happen to really believe in.

1573
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:09,510
表演必须继续
The show must go on and it will!

1574
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:10,940
-我们要让公众看到 -好的
-We owe it to the public. -Fine!

1575
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:12,210
我很同意你的看法
I agree with you absolutely,

1576
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:14,040
但是我没有看剧本
but I'd just as soon not read the play.

1577
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:16,050
我想从第一幕第一场开始
I would like to begin with act 1 scene 1,

1578
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:17,980
就是赛斯和我的对手戏 我想马上开演
between Seth's character and mine. I'd like to get it up right away.

1579
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:19,980
-等等 你说什么?  -你听到了
-Wait, I beg your pardon? -On its feet.

1580
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:22,820
好的...
Okay...

1581
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:24,890
是的 我想我们应该 先把剧本全看一遍
Yeah, well, I think that we should read the entire play first...

1582
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:26,490
考虑到现在的情况
Well, considering the situation,

1583
01:14:26,490 --> 01:14:28,460
当然我们不想谈
which of course we're not going to speak about,

1584
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:30,790
我想我们应该帮助 演员们适应它们
I think we ought to just help the actors get through this,

1585
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,030
就像进入到一个 漫长黑暗隧道的尽头
like getting to the end of a long, dark tunnel,

1586
01:14:33,030 --> 01:14:36,130
而不是去盲目的遵循 一些已于的规则
rather than try to follow some accepted directorial rules.

1587
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:38,570
我认为你是一个 非常有创新的导演
I'd like to think you're bigger than that as a director.

1588
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:43,040
有人有问题吗? 赛斯? 伊莎? 
Anybody have a problem with this? Seth? Izzy?

1589
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,140
-有问题吗?  -没有
-Anybody? -Nope.

1590
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:45,780
-不 我没有 -很好
-No, not me. -Great!

1591
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:52,750
好的 我们从第一场开始 只需要赛斯和德尔塔
Okay we'll start with scene 1. Only Seth and Delta are needed.

1592
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:55,920
其他人可以看剧本
The rest of us can watch from the orchestra.

1593
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:59,860
在卧室里安排一张 沙发和两把椅子行吗? 
Would you bring out the bedroom with the couch and the two chairs?

1594
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:04,790
好的 幕布升起来
All right, the curtain rises.

1595
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,630
在哈尔·芬尼根旅馆的房间里
It's hal finnegan's hotel suite.

1596
01:15:07,630 --> 01:15:09,270
德尔塔 准备好了就说...
Delta, whenever you're ready...

1597
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:12,740
第一句话不是我说的 如果是我就开始了
Well, I don't have the first line. But if I did I would begin.

1598
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:15,040
好的
All right.

1599
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,870
"既然你不想理解 我说的话 我能说什么呢? 
"Well, you refuse to understand what I'm saying, so what can I say?

1600
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,110
我想我很抱歉"
I'm sorry, I guess."

1601
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:22,750
"没事的 我习惯了
"That's okay, I'm used to it.

1602
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:25,680
你在不知道自己在说 什么时总是大喊大叫"
You always yell when you don't know what you're talking about."

1603
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,920
"我知道我在说什么 只是你不想听
"I know what I'm talking about, you don't want to hear it.

1604
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,950
这事情真是娘气"
It's a real female thing."

1605
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:32,190
"当你不想听的时候 你就不去听"
"When you don't want to hear something, you just don't hear it."

1606
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:33,960
"我真的很难理解你是
"Well, it's very hard for me to understand

1607
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:36,730
如何做到和别的女人 睡觉之后再和我睡的
"how you can sleep with other women and then sleep with me

1608
01:15:36,730 --> 01:15:38,230
然后告诉我没有任何关系"
and tell me it doesn't mean anything."

1609
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:40,060
-这是真的 -所以你说
-"Well, it's true." -"So you're saying

1610
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:42,930
"你和别的女人共度的时间
"that the time you spend with other women

1611
01:15:42,930 --> 01:15:45,970
都只是逢场作戏
"doesn't exist any more in your brain.

1612
01:15:45,970 --> 01:15:48,140
那不应该是很美好的回忆吗? "
It isn't some sort of pleasant memory?"

1613
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:49,970
不 我没那么说
"No, I didn't say that."

1614
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:52,310
-那好吧 -什么? 
-"Well, then..." -"Well, then what?"

1615
01:15:52,310 --> 01:15:54,740
"当你和我做爱的时候
"How can I not think about what you're thinking about

1616
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:57,080
我怎么才能不去想 你在想的事情? "
"when you're making love to me?

1617
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:59,650
"我怎么知道你当时 想的是我
"How do I know you're with me and not with some other woman

1618
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:01,920
而不是别的女人呢? "
"you made love to some other time?

1619
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,990
所以我们不同步
"Therefore we're not in sync?

1620
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:06,990
因为也许我也在想 别的男人 对吧? 
Because I might be thinking about some guy, too, right?"

1621
01:16:06,990 --> 01:16:08,890
我不知道我们怎么会这样
"I don't know how we got here.

1622
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:11,230
我只是说了句"我们为何不去 素食餐厅
"All I said was, 'why don't we go to a vegetarian restaurant.'

1623
01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:12,800
然后这吵闹就爆发了
"And this had to happen."

1624
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:15,330
把它给我
"Give me that."

1625
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:17,170
-不 你戒了 -你也是
-"No, you quit." -"So did you."

1626
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:19,100
我破了戒并不意味着 我就得...
"Well, just because I'm breaking my thing, doesn't mean I..."

1627
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:20,940
干嘛 我连抽口烟都不行? 
"What... I can't have a puff on your cigarette?"

1628
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:22,940
-我没那么说 -那你就给我啊
-"I didn't say that." -"Well, then, give it to me."

1629
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:24,640
不 现在抽烟让我觉得不好
"No, I feel bad now for smoking.

1630
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,640
因为这让我觉得 我怂恿你破戒了
'Cause it's like I'm breaking your thing..."

1631
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,350
我有自己的独立思想 我现在就想抽支烟
"I have an independent mind. I want a fucking puff on the cigarette! Now!"

1632
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:31,650
-好的 给你 -谢谢你
-"Okay, here." -"Thank you."

1633
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:40,360
叮铃铃...
Ring-Ring! Ring-Ring!

1634
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:41,990
干嘛不接电话? 
"Why don't you answer it?

1635
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:43,230
也许是你朋友打来的
"It's probably one of your friends.

1636
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:45,860
反正我朋友从来不打电话
"None of my friends can ever get through."

1637
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:50,600
你自己去接 我现在 不想和任何人说话
"Answer it yourself. I've no interest in talking to anybody right now."

1638
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,640
我有点饿了
"I'm getting kinda hungry...

1639
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:53,940
你想做什么? 
"What do you want to do?"

1640
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:55,940
我要你过来吻我
"I want you to come over here and kiss me."

1641
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:04,780
有详细的要求吗? 
"Any particular way?"

1642
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:06,950
蒙住眼睛 我双腿交叉
"Blindfolded with my legs crossed."

1643
01:17:06,950 --> 01:17:09,120
不如我蒙住眼睛 亲你的腿如何? 
"How about blindfolded with your legs apart?"

1644
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,920
这台词我觉得不太好 乔什 你觉得呢? 
I'm not sure about that line, Josh. What do you think?

1645
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,990
读剧本就好 赛斯
Just read the fucking script, Seth.

1646
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:15,290
好的 好的 好的
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1647
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:17,030
之后再回答你的傻问题
We'll get to your dumb actor questions later.

1648
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:19,130
按照剧本读 赛斯
Just read it, Seth.

1649
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:21,900
不如蒙住眼睛 你双腿分开? 
"How about blindfolded with your legs apart?"

1650
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,370
闭上嘴吻我
"Just shut up and kiss me."

1651
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:28,370
他 他倾下身子 给她一个深吻
"He, he, he leans in and gives her a long kiss."

1652
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,140
好的...
Okay...

1653
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:07,280
好的 好的 我明白了
All right, okay. I got it!

1654

Hey, that's it! Cut!

1655

<i>What is this, caligula? I'm suppose to sit here and watch this?</i>

1656

抱歉 我入戏太深

黑尔
Heel.

1661
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:31,470
你在这做什么? 珍妮在哪?

我来告诉你怎么回事
I'll tell you what's going on here.

1665
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:46,420

You hired that hooker because she turns good tricks.

1666
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:48,150

我能让你们都满足
I've got tricks on all of you!

1669
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:55,220
珍妮 你这样很没礼貌 非常不专业
Jane, this is very inappropriate and unprofessional!

1670
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:57,890
我才不管你想什么
I don't give a shit what you think!

1671
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,260
你以为你是谁 海明威吗?

珍妮·克莱蒙特小姐

1675

你是谁? 
And you are?

1676
01:19:06,490 --> 01:19:08,040
爸爸 你穿着那衣服做什么? 
Dad! What are you doing in that outfit?

1677
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,970
-我的天啊 -那是你父亲? 
-My goodness. -That's your father?

1678
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:14,180
那个经常找你的人是个拉比? 
The man who calls you constantly... Is a rabbi?

1679
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:16,850

-是的 -根据我的观察
-Yeah. -Well, from what I've just observed,

1681

1682
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,390

1683

她是谁 阿诺德? 
Who is she, Arnold?

1684

我不知道
I have no idea!

1685
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:29,230
她是我的前女友 阿诺德
She's my ex-girlfriend, Arnold.

1686
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:32,060
我是了解这一切的人
I am the person that knows what's going on here

1687
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:34,030
而且我受够了

Two that I know of, by now probably three?

Really?

1691
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:44,040

-Him... And him. -That's a lie!

1696
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:55,250
子弹可以杀人 但是拳头 可以把事情闹大
<i>A bullet can kill, but a punch can change things for the living.</i>

1697
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:56,480

<i>John Wayne won, of course, and they lived happily ever after.</i>

1701

We never did it.

1702
01:20:09,530 --> 01:20:12,370
住手 阿尔 住手 你以为你在做什么? 
Stop it, Al, just stop it! What the hell do you think you're doing?

1703
01:20:12,370 --> 01:20:13,970
这只是一场戏剧
This is all just a play!

1704
01:20:13,970 --> 01:20:16,070
这个又是谁? 
And who... Who is this?

1705
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:18,570
我父亲打破了僵局
<i>My father tore a hole in the sky.</i>

1706
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:20,140
大家都松了一口气
<i>Everyone felt a release.</i>

1707
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:22,580
慢点 先生
Slow down, sir.

1708
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:25,410
你不能就这样进来然后 把一切都毁了
You can't just come in here and ruin everything I'm doing, dad.

1709
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:26,880
怎么回事? 
What is going on?

1710
01:20:39,230 --> 01:20:40,560
不要靠近我
Don't come towards me!

1711
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:42,430
别过来 不然我会吹哨子
Don't come, I'll blow this whistle again!

1712
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:49,310
如果你不放开过去 未来就会受到影响
<i>If you don't let go of your past, it'll strangle your future.</i>

1713
01:21:07,090 --> 01:21:08,360
这是...给我一点
What is... Give me those!

1714
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,560
那些不是玩具
Those are not playthings.

1715
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:10,890
不 是橡胶做的
No, they're rubbers.

1716
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:13,360
说橡胶不太好 亲爱的
It's not nice to say rubbers, darling.

1717
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,160
-不 他们是避孕套 -不 是橡胶
-No, they're condoms. -No, they're rubbers.

1718
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:17,030
很高兴担任了这个角色
Wonderful plays your father directs...

1719
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:18,300
不 它们就是避孕套
No, they're condoms.

1720
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:43,060
我要离开我的生活
I'm going to live my life!

1721
01:21:43,630 --> 01:21:44,990
再见了
So long!

1722
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,350
什么? 什么? 
What? What?

1723
01:22:08,350 --> 01:22:10,920
那是我们的孩子
There's our baby!

1724
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,530
-我们的孩子 -嘿 她是我的
-Our baby! -Hey! She's mine.

1725
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:21,330
精彩 精彩
Bravo! Bravo!

1726
01:22:27,370 --> 01:22:28,970
精彩
Bravo!

1727
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:34,110
精彩
Bravo!

1728
01:22:36,010 --> 01:22:38,110
评论怎么样 好吗? 
<i>So the plays' reviews were that good?</i>

1729
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,650
好像演了一周
<i>I thought it closed in a week?</i>

1730
01:22:39,650 --> 01:22:41,150
是的...
Yeah...

1731
01:22:41,150 --> 01:22:43,220
我是说 问题是 长岛的妻子们
I mean, the problem is, Long Island house wives,

1732
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:46,620
她们可不愿意去看 一群应召女演话剧
they don't want to spend their big night out in the company of call girls.

1733
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:48,960
她们想看跳舞的狮子
They want dancing lions.

1734
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,460
她们想看唱歌
They want singing mormons, you know.

1735
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:54,330
她们去影院是为了逃避
They go to the theater to escape.

1736
01:22:54,330 --> 01:22:56,030
很讽刺 对吧? 
It's ironic, isn't it?

1737
01:22:57,540 --> 01:23:01,300
但是还有些魔法在等着我
But there was still a sprinkle of magic waiting for me.

1738
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:04,240
观众席中在我妈妈 身后坐着一个人
<i>There was this guy in the audience, sat behind my mother,</i>

1739
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:07,110
他拥有一家电影工作室
<i>and he owned a movie studio.</i>

1740
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:09,210
剩下的就是历史了
And the rest is history.

1741
01:23:09,210 --> 01:23:12,380
是的 我很幸运
Yeah, well, I was really lucky.

1742
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:14,280
就是那个导致了你和 乔什的分开吗? 
Is that what caused you and Josh to split up?

1743
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:16,740
你成功了? 
Your success?

1744
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:19,190
你知道 我只是觉得生活中
<i>Well, you know, I just feel like some things in life</i>

1745
01:23:19,190 --> 01:23:20,620
有些事情是无法永远持续的
<i>aren't meant to last forever.</i>

1746
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:22,460
嘿 赛斯
Hey, Seth!

1747
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:24,190
-嘿 薇琪 -抱歉来迟了
-Hey, Vickie. -Sorry we're late.

1748
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,760
-没关系 -她是谁? 
-That's okay. -Who's that?

1749
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,300
她为什么在这儿?  那些女人是谁? 
Why is she here? Who are all those women?

1750
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:30,570
你邀请了她们吗?  她们是应召女? 
Did you invite them? Is this an activist group?

1751
01:23:30,570 --> 01:23:33,370
可以那么说
You could say that.

1752
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:35,240
-天啊 不 趴下 -什么? 
-Dear God, no! Get down! -What?

1753
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,310
-我的脚很疼 -我的天
-My feet are killing me. -My God...

1754
01:23:37,310 --> 01:23:39,240
-松鼠和坚果 -不不不
-Squirrels to the nuts! -No, no, no...

1755
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:40,640
他就是我经常说起的家伙
That's the guy I always talked to you about!

1756
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:42,750
-我还以为事情结束了 -是啊
-I thought that was the end. -It is!

1757
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:46,180
你不知道.... 你不知道你改变了我的生活
You have no idea... You have no idea! You changed my life!

1758
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:49,150
我找了所有叫迈克尔·哈里森的人
I looked for every Michael Harrington in the world, practically.

1759
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:53,260
我用那些钱发展了 镇上最好的三陪服务
I took that money and parlayed it into the best escort service in town, honey.

1760
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:55,020
你觉得她们如何? 
How do you like them apples?

1761
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:56,190
见到你真好
Great to see you!

1762
01:23:56,190 --> 01:23:57,530
再见 回见
Bye, I'll catch you later.

1763
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,160
结束了
That's the end.

1764
01:24:01,130 --> 01:24:02,460
阿诺德怎么样了? 
<i>And Arnold?</i>

1765
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:04,330
我没见到他
Well, I haven't seen him.

1766
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:08,100
最近听说他在为 非营利性组织工作
Last I heard he was working for some sort of non-profit organization

1767
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:11,440
为女性慈善机构 捐赠了不少钱
making very large, anonymous donations to women's charities.

1768
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:14,210
然后德尔塔看上了新的人
And then Delta, she fell for a new guy.

1769
01:24:14,210 --> 01:24:17,680
一个火箭专家 她想上月球
Some sort of rocket scientist. You know, she's over the moon about that.

1770
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:22,650
而我的医生...我想依然 和赛斯·吉尔伯特在一起
And then my therapist... I think she's still with Seth Gilbert.

1771
01:24:22,650 --> 01:24:25,790
你知道 红色蜜蜂
<i>You know, the red bees. So...</i>

1772
01:24:25,790 --> 01:24:28,620
发展的非常好
Yeah, it all wrapped up real nice.

1773
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:31,290
就像是一部电影
You know, sort of just like a movie.

1774
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:34,430
那你呢? 你找到另一半了吗? 
What about you? Is there a person in your life?

1775
01:24:34,430 --> 01:24:38,830
我找到了一个良师益友
Well, let's just say I got a mentor...

1776
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:42,240
其实就是因为他 我才告诉你这些
He's actually a lot of the reason why I'm telling you all this.

1777
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:44,140
他是一个很会讲道理的人
He's very into saying it how it is.

1778
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:47,440
他说这个镇子的人 喜欢有过去的演员
He says that this town loves an actress with a past

1779
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:49,450
他说的很对
and he's sure right about that.

1780
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:51,710
听起来你找到了自己的位置
Well, it sounds like you've found your place.

1781
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:54,320
不管是什么 你都很开心
Wherever you are, that's your happy place.

1782
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,690
就像松鼠和坚果
Squirrels to the nuts, and all of that.

1783
01:24:56,690 --> 01:24:58,290
你现在会引用了? 
<i>You're quoting cluny brown now?</i>

1784
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,620
什么? 
What?

1785
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:03,860
那句台词是克鲁尼·布朗说的
<i>That "Squirrels To The Nuts" line, it's from Lubitsch's Cluny Brown.</i>

1786
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:06,200
-嘿 亲爱的 -嘿
-Hey, darling. -Hey.

1787
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:08,360
是查尔斯·博野 对詹妮弗·琼斯说过的
It's what Charles Boyer says to Jennifer Jones

1788
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:10,170
在他们相爱之前
just before they fall in love.

1789
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:12,730
你是在告诉我这句话 甚至不是原创吗? 
You mean to tell me after all that, it's not even original?

1790
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:14,570
什么原创? 
What's original?

1791
01:25:14,570 --> 01:25:16,570
亲爱的 如果我们还想 去看演唱会的话
Honey, if we're going to get to the Sonny Chiba triple feature

1792
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:18,540
现在就得走了
we need to leave right now.

1793
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:20,280
他是个功夫明星
He's a kung-fu actor.

1794
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:22,110
他是这个地球上 唯一比我还爱电影的人
He's the only guy on the planet who loves movies more than I do.

1795
01:25:22,110 --> 01:25:24,750
是的 但是你知道很多
Yep. True! But you know a lot.

1796
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:36,790
真有趣
That's very interesting,

1797
01:25:36,790 --> 01:25:38,730
你看起来很压抑
you don't seem to be inhibited.

1798
01:25:38,730 --> 01:25:40,530
试着特别一些
Try to be more specific,

1799
01:25:40,530 --> 01:25:43,200
是什么让你觉得不合适? 
what made you think that you were out of place?

1800
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:44,570
我没这么想
I didn't think I was.

1801
01:25:44,570 --> 01:25:46,640
是阿尔叔叔 他总是告诉我
It's Uncle Arn. He's always telling me,

1802
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:49,270
"克鲁尼·布朗 你不知道你的位置"
"Cluny Brown, you don't know your place."

1803
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:51,470
没人能决定你的位置
Nobody can tell you where your place is.

1804
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,310
我的位置是什么?  大家的位置是什么? 
Where is my place? Where is anybody's place?

1805
01:25:53,310 --> 01:25:54,710
我告诉你是什么
I'll tell you where it is.

1806
01:25:54,710 --> 01:25:57,280
你开心的地方就是你的位置
Wherever you're happy, that's your place.

1807
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:00,650
开心是让人适应环境
And happiness is a matter of purely personal adjustment

1808
01:26:00,650 --> 01:26:02,180
最好的方式
to your environment.

1809
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:03,620
比如说在海德公园
In Hyde Park, for instance.

1810
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:06,590
有些人喜欢给松鼠喂坚果
Some people like to feed nuts to the squirrels.

1811
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:08,860
但是如果你觉得给 坚果喂松鼠很有趣
But if it makes you happy to feed Squirrels To The Nuts,

1812
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:11,190
那就可以去做 没什么不对的
who am I to say nuts to the squirrels?

1813
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,640
你做了什么 笨蛋? 
What did you do? Schmuck!

1814
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,230
谢谢你 埃利奥特
Thank you, Elliot.

1815
01:26:55,230 --> 01:26:56,930
你要考虑的就是
All you could come up with

1816
01:26:56,930 --> 01:26:59,170
所谓职业道德的软肋
was this weak borscht about professional ethics

1817
01:26:59,170 --> 01:27:02,770
因为你担心人们是否 能处理好这些冠冕堂皇
<i>because you are worried about how this thug will handle rejection.</i>
