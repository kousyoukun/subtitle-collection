2
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,560
我相信美滿結局
I believe in happy endings.

3
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,430
而且這是對我來說唯一有意義的事
And it's the only thing that's ever made sense to me.

4
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,190
你知道 我以前常常會把自己 鎖在房間裏
You know, I used to lock myself in my room

5
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,530
用廣播聽著所有那些老歌
and watch all the oldies on PBS.

6
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,300
我們付不起有線電視費
We couldn't afford cable, which was fine.

7
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,400
你知道 就是那種少女懷孕時
You know, who needs to watch shows on teenage pregnancy

8
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,070
屋子裏還有其他孩子在相互吵鬧時 看的那種電視
and kids living in the same house screaming at each other?

9
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,210
在我家那個地方 這被稱之為"星期三"
In my neighborhood, that was called wednesday.

10
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,580
那個 我以前還和斯賓塞·屈塞 凱特·赫伯恩一起逃跑過
Well, I used to escape with Spencer Tracy and Kate Hepburn

11
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,410
還和弗雷德·阿斯泰爾 金吉·羅傑斯在舞池旋轉過
and Fred Astaire spinning Ginger Rogers on the dance floor

12
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:28,080
最後撞上了勞倫·白考爾
and Bogie finally plant one on Lauren Bacall.

13
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,080
她當時穿著華麗的黑白的裙子
All in glorious black and white.

14
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,820
你喜歡通話?
You like fairy tales?

15
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,660
我覺得我們是不是都需要一點魔力 你不覺得嗎?
I think we all need a little magic from time to time, don't you think?

16
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,290
我是說 如果默夫雲·萊羅依
I mean, what would Lana Turner have done

17
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,130
從來沒去過好萊塢和藤街的
if Mervyn Leroy had never gone into Schwab's

18
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,330
嘉信餐廳
on Hollywood and Vine

19
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,860
看到拉娜·特納在那喝可樂 她會怎麼樣呢?
and he saw her there, drinking that coke.

20
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,100
她當時就在那 而那瓶可樂 改變了她的人生
She was discovered right there, and that coke changed her life.

21
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,330
好吧 於是他們告訴遊客
Well, so they tell the tourists,

22
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,870
因為那不是嘉信餐廳
because it wasn't Schwab's

23
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,210
事實上那是在日落大道和 卡登大道交匯處的大禮貌餐廳
It was actually a place called top hat on Sunset and McCadden.

24
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,990
而且主人公也不是默夫雲·萊羅依
And it wasn't Mervyn Leroy,

25
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,770
事實上是好萊塢的一個記者
it was actually a guy from the Hollywood Reporter.

26
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,610
而且她的名字甚至也不叫拉娜·特納
And her name wasn't even Lana Turner then.

27
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,150
而是朱迪 事實上 她的真名叫茱莉亞
It was Judy... Actually her real name was Julia.

28
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,350
但這些你全都知道 對嗎?
But you knew all that, right?

29
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:07,190
你知道 儘管這魔力可能不太一樣
You know, it doesn't really have the same magic, though.

30
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:15,650
片名：愛你就捧你

31
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,710
這麼說你覺得你會來到這 是因為魔力?
So you think you got here by magic?

32
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,880
這是最純粹的說法
In its purest form.

33
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,410
我是說 人生中有一千次...
I mean, there are a thousand, no...

34
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,220
不 是一百萬次的左右抉擇
There are a million lefts or rights.

35
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,220
選擇一條路 而不是逃避
Picking up instead of dodging a call.

36
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,490
決定去印度而不是意大利
Deciding on indian instead of italian.

37
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,690
你知道 當你只想睡的時候 強迫自己走出去
You know, willing yourself to go out, when all you want to do is sleep.

38
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,860
我甚至能回溯到我踏出的第一步
I can almost trace it back to the very first step.

39
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,860
像拉娜一樣
Blows my mind...

40
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,930
為一個可能改變人生的機會的幻想 而欣喜若狂
To think that just like Lana, a chance encounter changed my life.

41
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,500
當然 我一直覺得能改變我人生的
Of course, I always thought the guy who would change my life

42
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,440
會是像馬龍·白蘭度那樣強大的人
would be powerful like Marlon Brando

43
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,740
或是像加裏·格蘭特那樣閃耀的
or sparkle like Cary Grant

44
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,410
或是想詹姆斯·迪恩那樣 穿著皮革的人
or smell like worn leather like James Dean.

45
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,680
艾伯森先生 還有什麼 需要我幫忙的嗎?
Mr. Albertson, do you need me for anything else?

46
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,180
-不用 我可以的 謝謝 -好的
-I'm good. Fine. Thank you. -Okay.

47
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,290
你永遠不會想到是一個人
You never think it will just be some guy

48
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:18,490
就一個看起來普普通通
who looks like some guy

49
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,560
和我們所有其他人一樣平凡的人
who's just as screwed up as the rest of us.

50
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,500
你好 我想我預定了房間 德裏克·托馬斯
Hello. I think I've a reservation. Derek Thomas.

51
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,830
是的 托馬斯先生 你的房間是 1369號套房
Yes, Mr. Thomas. You're in suite 1369.

52
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,870
-好的 -行李員
-Okay. -Bellman.

53
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,370
-謝謝 -不客氣 這邊請
-Thank you. -Sure. Right this way.

54
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,370
-您從哪飛過來的?  -洛杉磯
-Where'd you fly in from? -Los Angeles.

55
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,210
洛杉磯 我一直都想去那
L.A. I've always wanted to go there.

56
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,610
那邊美女如雲
A lot of pretty girls.

57
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,380
當然 美女到處都是
Of course, there are a lot of pretty girls everywhere.

58
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,380
這是這個世界上的妙處之一
That's one of the nice things about the world.

59
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,220
先生 你以前在我們這住過嗎?
So have you stayed with us before, sir?

60
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,220
住過
Yeah.

61
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,790
那邊現在的天氣如何?
So, how's the weather out there now?

62
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,620
你知道 總是非常的壓抑
You know, it's always oppressively perfect.

63
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,460
好吧 看看是誰來了!
Well, look who's here!

64
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,700
賽斯 親愛的 我以為你住在皮埃爾
Seth, my darling. I thought you were staying at the Pierre.

65
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,500
我還以為你住在丈母娘家呢
And I thought you were at your in-laws.

66
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,930
沒有 等明天德爾塔和孩子們到了 我才去那住
No, not till tomorrow. That's when Delta and the kids arrive.

67
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,900
我一個人應付不了她父母
I can't handle her parents by myself.

68
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,840
-人類最好的朋友 -這是威爾巴
-Man's best friend. -This is Wilba.

69
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,710
你待會兒準備去幹嘛? 吃晚飯嗎?
So what are you doing later? You want some dinner?

70
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,910
不吃了 我好累 精疲力盡
No, I'm so worn out. Exhausted.

71
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,480
你知道 還在倒時差
You know, jet lag and everything.

72
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,250
聽聽我的不幸遭遇吧
It was a very tough little picture.

73
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,310
沒睡覺 背部還受傷了
No sleep. Hurt my back.

74
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,480
我最好洗個鹽浴 直接就睡了
I better just take an epsom salt bath and go straight to bed.

75
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,360
晚安 咱們排練時見
Goodnight. I will see you at Rehearsals.

76
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,590
你為什麼也下來了?
And why are you getting off?

77
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,560
我住這層啊 1317號房
I'm on this floor. 1317.

78
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,800
真方便 好吧
That's convenient. Okay.

79
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,430
我去睡覺了
I'm going to turn in.

80
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,830
好吧 知道我的導演就在附近 可真令我感到安慰
Well, it's comforting to know my director's close by.

81
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,940
-跟德爾塔問個好 -好的
-Love to Delta. -Okay.

82
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,840
演員啊...
Actors...

83
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,640
是啊 我明白你的意思 我也是個演員!
Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm an actor!

84
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,510
他們總是有些特別之處的 不是嗎?
There's something special about them, isn't there?

85
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,750
我就是這意思
That's just what I meant.

86
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,980
幹嘛? 我們什麼都不想買 所以得了吧!
What? We don't want to buy anything so forget it!

87
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,020
我是和我父母在布魯克林長大的
I was raised in Brooklyn with my parents,

88
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,420
你知道 那的生活很艱辛
which was tough, you know.

89
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,820
他們很久以前就已經不相信 有什麼美滿結局了
They stopped believing in happy endings a long time ago.

90
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,860
閉嘴! 我能處理
Shut up! I can handle this.

91
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,590
不! 你才閉嘴
No! You shut up.

92
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,790
但我在努力不去責怪他們
But I try not to blame them.

93
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,290
他們一開始其實挺順利的
Things started out great for them,

94
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,800
1974年 我媽媽加冕科尼島小姐
like ma was crowned miss Coney Island, 1974,

95
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,360
全都是因為爸爸
All because of pops.

96
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,970
他是評委中的一員嗎?
He was one of the judges?

97
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,870
不 他當時在街上賣熱狗的
No. He was selling the hot-dogs on the boardwalk,

98
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,800
但他觀看了整場走秀 而且他看見了我媽媽
but he watched the entire pageant, and he sees my ma,

99
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,070
然後就愛上了她 非常
And he falls for her, like, hard.

100
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,380
所以 他就開始往熱狗裏 加發霉的芥末
So he starts putting all this rotten mustard in all the hot-dogs

101
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,810
而我媽媽是舞台上 唯一一個沒跑去廁所
and my ma is the only one who doesn't run off the stage

102
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,450
釋放她肚子的人 所以...
clutching her stomach, so...

103
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,650
就搞定了
That sealed it.

104
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,490
他的主意可多了
But he had a million ideas

105
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,820
而且他以前對我媽媽承諾說 他成就大事業
and he used to promise my ma that it was only gonna be a matter of time

106
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,060
只是個時間問題
before one of them hit.

107
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,660
所以 她在一家豪華沙龍裏 找了一份洗頭髮的工作
So she got a job washing hair in a beauty salon

108
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,590
然後她等啊等...
and she was waiting and waiting...

109
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,430
你知道 20年過去了 她還在給人洗頭
And you know, twenty years go by and she's still washing hair.

110
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,100
那你父親做什麼呢?
What does he do, your father?

111
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,500
他搞發明
He invents things.

112
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,940
比如?
Like what?

113
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,470
你知道固體膠嗎?
Do you know the glue stick?

114
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,710
他發明的?
He invented that?

115
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,510
不 他發明了固體黃油
No. He invented the butter stick,

116
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,540
所以 你可以很方便地 用它塗抹你的吐司
so you smooth it on your toast real good.

117
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,480
但...我是說 那在日本很受歡迎
But... I mean, it was huge in Japan.

118
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,780
你好 薇琪公司
Hello, Vickie's.

119
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,920
嗨 薇琪 我現在在巴克利酒店
Hi, Vickie. I'm over at the Barclay

120
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,500
我打電話是想問今晚
and I was calling about the availability

121
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,090
你們的一個陪同人員是否有空
of one of your escorts for this evening.

122
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,660
先生 您指哪一個?
Which one is that, sir?

123
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,430
就這個網頁上的 戈爾
From the webpage here. Glo.

124
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,560
抱歉 能麻煩你稍等一下嗎?
Can you hold on just one minute? I'm sorry.

125
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,660
好的
Yeah, okay.

126
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,070
-喂?  -·艾伯森先生
-Hello? -Mr. Albertson.

127
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,540
誰啊 哪位?
Who's this? Who is it?

128
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,370
是我啊 爸爸 我是大衛
It's me, dad. It's David.

129
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,480
大衛 你在哪啊?
David. Where are you?

130
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,440
老天 在家啊 不然你以為我在哪
Home. Geez, dad, where do you think I am?

131
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,410
我們現在準備出發了
We're getting ready to leave.

132
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,150
你要出發了? 我以為你們明天才能到

since I've been on a stage. I don't think I can sleep tonight.

180
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,870

00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,570
這麼說傳言是真的?
So the rumors are true?

198
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,140
-你的確做過... -繆斯?

201
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,550
這是真正的工作嗎?
That's a real job?

202
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,250
是啊 對我來說是
Yeah. It was for me.

203
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,920
我的客戶大都是些可憐人
My clients were mostly poor souls.

204
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,850
魔力完全被掏空了的人
Completely empty of magic.

205
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,790
所以 我的工作就是讓他們重獲新生
So it was my job to breathe life back into them.

206
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,890
-看!  -你得讓一個人感覺特別
-Look! -You make a person feel special.

207
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,030
把他們當做是這個世界上 最重要的人來對待
You treat them like they're the most important thing in the world.

208
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,960
有那麼一小時...
And for an hour...

209
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,870

There was one particular client which...

211
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,840
我待會再跟你細說他的事吧
I'll tell you more about him in a minute.

212
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,640
他雇了一個私家偵探 讓他偷偷跟著我
He hired a private eye, called him a gumshoe, to follow me.

213
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,710
我不介意
I didn't mind.

214
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,780
有人總是想知道我在哪 我覺得
It was kind of flattering that someone wanted to know

215
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,750
這算是對我的奉承
where I was all the time.

216
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,170

Well, then have him pay you now for two hours, and see how it goes.

236
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,830

No other client ever took me for a drink,

264
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,440
吃飯或是坐馬車 你知道吧?
or for a meal or a buggy ride, you know?

265
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,810
他們只想"脫 干 謝謝你 女士"
They just want to, you know, "wham, bam", thank you, ma'am.

266
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,280
我猜我是那種浪漫型的
I guess, I'm the romantic type.

267
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,120
是啊 的確
Yeah, you are.

268
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,050
的確 你是個浪漫的人
You are. You are a romantic guy.

269
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,450
你想做什麼? 我是說 除了這個
What do you want to do? I mean, besides this.

270
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,920
你想做什麼?
What do you want to do?

271
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,960
我想...
I want...

272
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,390
我想演戲
I want to act, you know.

273
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,200
是的 我想當演員
Yeah, I want to be an actress.

274
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,330
當然 那樣我爸爸就會因為我演戲
But then, of course, my dad thinks I'm on cloud nine

275
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,070
-開心的上雲霄了 -為什麼?
-with the whole acting thing. -Why?

276
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,270
因為在我等到我的機會之前
'Cause it's like I just do this as a way to earn a living

277
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,340
我只是為了謀生才這麼做
while I wait until my break, you know.

278
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,110
也能幫家裏分擔一些
Also help my folks out a little.

279
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,780
也許還有其他更好的謀生之路啊
Well, maybe there's a better way to earn a living.

280
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,950
你知道 當你和男人約會
Well, you know, you date guys...

281
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,280
他們想要什麼?
What do they want?

282
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,080
他們想和你上床
They want you in the sack.

283
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,090
我見過的男人都是這樣的
So this way, guys I meet, that's all they want, too,

284
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,820
但至少他們得為此而付錢
but at least they're gonna pay for it.

285
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,390
你知道 你遇到一個 沒有任何非分之想的男人
You know, you meet a guy and they expect it for nothing.

286
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,230
這樣的話 我就佔優勢
So this way I figure I'm ahead of the game.

287
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,870
但那真的讓我感覺不太好 真的
But it doesn't really make me feel good, really.

288
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,100
我覺得你棒極了
I think you're terrific.

289
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:43,480
你知道 你算是那種 最注重細節的愛侶了!
You know, you are the most detailed kind of lover!

290
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,120
-注重細節?  -是啊
-Detailed? -Yeah.

291
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,220
感覺...非常棒
Like... That was amazing.

292
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,230
我真的很喜歡你
I really like you.

293
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,000
聽著...
Listen...

294
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,570
你想不想很我做筆交易?
You wanna make a deal with me?

295
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,500
什麼交易?
What kinda deal?

296
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,570
不 不 不 我明天就要走了
No, no, no. I'm, I'm leaving tomorrow.

297
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,140
但如果你...如果你今晚 莊重地對我承諾
But if you... If you promise me tonight, solemnly,

298
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,470
以你的人格擔保
on your word of honor,

299
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,180
你永遠不會再這麼做了
that you'll never do this again,

300
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:15,980
我就給你3萬美金
I'll give you $30,000.

301
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,990
什麼...給這麼多錢做愛嗎?
What... To have sex?

302
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,920
不 不 你知道 因為錢
No, no, you know, for money.

303
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,160
答應我你只會在你喜歡上一個人 的時候才會這麼做 而不是因為愛
Promise me you'll only do it when you, when you like someone, or for love.

304
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,200
就因為這個 你要給我3萬?
What you're gonna give me $30,000 for that?

305
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,900
是啊
Yeah.

306
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,400
我是說 這能給你的演藝事業 一個新的開始
I mean, it'll give you a fresh start on your acting,

307
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,500
或是任何你想做的事
and whatever you want to do.

308
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,240
你真是個浪漫的人!
You are a romantic guy!

309
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,440
但你不是認真的吧?
But you're not really serious?

310
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,250
不 我是認真的 錢就在行李箱裏
No, I'm serious. It's, it's in the suitcase.

311
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,980
沒有任何附加條件 我保證 我只是...
No strings attached, I promise. I just...

312
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,280
我覺得你很棒
I think you're great.

313
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,050
真的
I do.

314
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,620
你知道嗎 你算是第一個這麼說的人
You're kinda the first one, you know?

315
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,430
我爸爸總說 我想去演戲真是瘋了
Like, my, my dad always said that I was just crazy for wanting to act

316
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,900
他還說 那永遠不可能 成為我的"人生位置"
and he said it was never going to be "my place in life",

317
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,370
他是這麼說的
He called it.

318
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,530
-我媽媽也是 -這太荒唐了
-And my mom, too. -That's ridiculous.

319
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,500
沒人能告訴你 你的位置在哪
Nobody can tell you where your place is.

320
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,570
我的位置在哪? 別人的位置在哪
Where's my place? Where's anybody's place.

321
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,140
你想知道在哪嗎?  就在你覺得幸福的地方
You want to know where it is? Wherever you're happy.

322
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:19,150
那就是你的位置 而你就是最好的裁判
That's where your place is. And you're the best judge of that.

323
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,550
比如 在中央公園裏
In central park, for instance,

324
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,320
有些人喜歡給松鼠喂堅果
some people like to feed nuts to the squirrels.

325
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,190
但如果喂松鼠吃堅果讓某人覺得開心
But if it makes someone happy to feed squirrels to the nuts,

326
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,490
我憑什麼說他是喂松鼠的傻瓜呢?
who am I to say nuts to the squirrels?

327
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,500
-你說的太好了!  -很棒吧 對
-That is just terrific! -It's good, right.

328
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,430
你能再親我一次嗎?
Say, could you, could you kiss me again?

329
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,340
在給我3萬塊之前?
Before the 30 grand?

330
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,940
你知道 這個人 這個擁有美麗心靈的人
You know, this man, this beautiful person,

331
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,310
他想做的 只是照顧我
all he wanted to do was care for me.

332
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,410
對我來說
For me...

333
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,050
他做到了
And he did.

334
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,590
而且 他在紐約改變了我的人生
And he changed my life, in a New York minute.

335
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,090
你知道 我對他有種
You know, I think I felt something for him

336
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,660
我從未對誰有過的感覺
that I never felt for anybody before.

337
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,720
愛嗎?
Love?

338
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,430
感激
Gratitude.

339
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,000
他用我鼓舞我客戶的方式鼓舞了我
He inspired me the way that I inspired my clients.

340
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,370
就算是繆斯女神 也需要一個女神
Even a muse needs a muse.

341
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,240
我會想你的 戈爾...
I'll miss you, Glo...

342
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,340
我是說 伊莎
I mean, Izzy.

343
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,180
不 我會想念你的
No, I'll miss you...

344
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,250
祝你旅途順利
You have a good trip.

345
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,750
好的 注意安全
Okay. Be safe.

346
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,720
你知道 我永遠不會忘記你 德裏克
You know, I'll never forget you, Derek.

347
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,090
我也是
Me too.

348
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,650
賈斯汀?
Justin!

349
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,670
我之前和你提過的那個客戶 是個法官
That client I told you about earlier, was a judge.

350
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:55,110
而且他寫不出他的裁決 或是觀點什麼的
And he couldn't write his judgments or opinions or whatever.

351
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:00,010
所以 我幫了他一把 完全把他解救了
So, I worked with him a little bit and yeah, totally helped him out.

352
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,150
問題是 當你鼓舞了某個人
The problem is that when you inspire people

353
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:07,190
他們就想繼續 一次一次被鼓舞
they want to keep getting inspired, over and over again.

354
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,060
有時候甚至是幾小時
Sometimes for hours.

355
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,760
就像毒品 有癮
It's like a drug. Highly addictive.

356
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,230
如果你得不到 你就會開始坐立不安
If you don't get it, you start to go batty.

357
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,500
你好 這裏是薇琪公司 我們現在暫時無法接聽
Hello, this is Vickie's. We're not here right now,

358
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,430
請留言 我們稍後將回復您
but leave a message and we'll call you back soon.

359
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,570
你好 薇琪嗎? 我是杜力德博士
Hello, Vickie? This is Dr. Dolittle.

360
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,540
-你不能打給我... -喂 喂 博士
-You can't call me... -Hello, hello, Doc.

361
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,740
你為什麼那麼小聲? 你在哪?  尼瓜拉加瀑布嗎?
Why are you whispering? Where are you? Niagara falls?

362
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,480
不 不 不 我不得不給你打電話 是因為...
No, no, no. But I just had to call you because...

363
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,750
戈爾...你知道 我需要再見她一面
Glo... You know. I need to see her again.

364
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,820
-她不幹了 -不幹了?
-She's quit. -Quit?

365
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,620
-不幹了是什麼意思?  -不幹了就是不幹了
-What do you mean, quit? -Quit means quit.

366
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,220
你願意找別的人嗎?
Now, would you like anybody else?

367
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,220
我可以送一個非常漂亮的金髮姑娘去
I have a very nice blond I can send over.

368
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,360
現在不行 我待會回給你
Not now. I'll call back.

369
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,830
我是薇薇安·克萊蒙特博士
This is Dr. Vivian Claremont.

370
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,840
我在休7年一次的年假 將在托斯卡納區待6個月
I have gone on sabbatical and will be in Tuscany for six months.

371
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,840
如果有急事找我 可以告訴我女兒
Any of you who need immediate help may speak to my daughter,

372
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,540
找到她就等於找到了我 她的名字叫珍妮·克萊蒙特
who is very empathetic, her name is Jane Claremont.

373
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,850
有任何急事 請撥打她的電話
In an emergency, call her cellphone.

374
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,220
紐約有8百萬人
Eight million people in New York

375
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,220
好像大家都彼此認識
and it seems like everyone knows everyone.

376
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,630
誰電話 能趕緊接一下嗎?
Will somebody answer their God damn phone?

377
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:23,230
你母親沒給你留緊急聯絡方式嗎?
Didn't your mother leave you an emergency line?

378
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,010
該死 該死!
Shit! Shit!

379
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,800
我可以把這想成是一種提醒我們
I like to think that coincidence is a way of reminding us

380
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
某個有偉大藍圖的人的方式的一種巧合
that there's somebody up there with a master plan.

381
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,250
喂? 哪位?
Yes? Hello? Who is it?

382
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,700
喂 是克萊蒙特的女兒嗎?
Hello, is this the Claremont daughter?

383
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,870
對 哪位?
Yes. Who is it?

384
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,240
那個 我現在有緊急事故
Well, I'm having a bit of an emergency.

385
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,140
緊急事故? 好吧 可能只是 你覺得是緊急事故吧
An emergency? All right, you probably just think it's an emergency!

386
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,880
我剛把東西都掉在紐約市街頭了
I have just dropped all of my stuff on the street in New York City.

387
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,120
這才叫緊急事故! 您的是什麼?
Now, that is an emergency! What's yours?

388
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,150
那個 我遇到點問題 算是某種強迫癥...
Well, I'm, I'm having a problem. It's kind of an obsession...

389
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,520
上癮?
An obsession?

390
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,720
好吧 我能告訴你我的經驗之談嗎
All right, can I just tell you something from experience,

391
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,390
強迫癥並非緊急事故
obsessions are not emergencies.

392
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,660
這是伴隨了你一輩子的事
They stick with you your entire life

393
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,260
所以你最好面對它 這東西會伴隨你
so you better just face it, that this thing is going to be with you

394
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,670
非常長的時間
for a really long time.

395
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,500
要麼你試著克服它
Either you just have to get over it,

396
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,640
要麼就應對它 好嗎?
or deal with it, all right?

397
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,410
所以 如果你在工作時間打給我 那很好
So, if you would like to call me during office hours, that's fine.

398
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,840
我週一 週二工作
I work monday, tuesday,

399
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,210
週三上午不工作 也就是現在

400
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,380
週四早上也不工作 也就是明天
Not thursday mornings, which is tomorrow.

401
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,590
所以你可以今天下午打給我
So you can call me this afternoon,

402
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,420
或者明天下午和週五全天 好嗎?

403
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,450
我不想被無聊的事打擾
I don't want to be bothered with nonsense.

404
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,220
拜託 你已經是個成年人了 成熟點!

00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,200
約書亞! 拜託 拜託 你能把狗拉住嗎?
Joshua! Please, please, can you just hold the dog?

408
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,510
拜託 我在接電話 正在處理緊急事故
Please. I'm on the phone, I'm dealing with emergencies.

409
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,540
人們需要我 我是個看護員 這就是我的工作
People need me. I'm a caregiver, it's what I do and...

410
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,650
你知道 你真的應該對人更禮貌一些
Well, then, you know, you should really try to be more polite to people.

411
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,920
你今天什麼毛病?
What is it with you today?

412
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,850
有人往你的玉米片裏撒尿了嗎?
Did someone take a piss in your cornflakes?

413
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,450
沒什麼 只是對明天的試鏡有點緊張
Nothing. I'm just a little nervous about tomorrow's casting.

414
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,860
有什麼大不了的? 不應該...
What is the big deal? It shouldn't...

415
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,360
-我說過 別打給我... -不 是我的電話
-I told you to please not call... -No, it's my phone.

416
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,600
爸爸 現在不是時候
It's not a good time right now, dad.

417
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,600
真不敢相信你是在和你爸爸說話
I cannot believe you're talking to your father.

418
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,270
-他剛打電話來了 -你爸爸!
-He just called. -Your father!

419
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,310
-我這就給他回 -拜託
-I'm calling him back. -Please!

420
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,670
他打電話給你...感覺你好像 每天都在過父親節!
He calls you all the... It's like its father's day with you every day!

421
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,380
我是說 那個人總是打電話給你!
I mean, the guy calls you all the time!

422
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,310
-不 他沒有 -這太奇怪了
-No, he doesn't. -It's a little weird.

423
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,380
-老實說 我受夠了 -他只打了我一次電話
-Honestly, I'm getting fed up with it. -He's called me once.

424
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,820
事實上 我受夠了 我走了
In fact, I am fed up with it. I'm out of here.

425
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,980
出租車!
Taxi!

426
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,450
出租車!
Taxi!

427
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,520
你不要你的狗和購物袋了嗎?
Don't you want your dog or your bags?

428
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,660
你是我見過的最無禮的人
You are the rudest person I have ever met.

429
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,330
走吧 謝普
Come on. Come on, shep.

430
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,100
出租車!
Taxi!

431
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,870
也許那個法官和珍妮醫生 並沒有我想像中那麼古怪
Maybe that judge or Dr. Jane wasn't as nutty as I remember.

432
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,740
真乖
Good girl.

433
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,940
但記憶不是錄像機
But memory isn't a video camera.

434
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,810
對嗎?
Is it?

435
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,480
喂? 弗利特偵探 我們從來都不太忙
Hello? Fleet detectives. We're never too busy.

436
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,680
我不能放棄 我已經想了一晚上了
I can't give up. I've thought about it all night.

437
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,590
我必須見到她 這要求過分嗎?
I've got to see her, is that too much to ask?

438
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,620
稍等 法官 她的竊聽器有聲音了
Just a minute, judge. Her wiretap just came on.

439
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,860
-發生什麼事了?  -她的經紀人在呼叫她
-What's happening? -Her agent is calling her.

440
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,790
喂? 我給你爭取了一次試鏡

444
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,540
主角? 沒開玩笑吧
It's a lead? No kidding.

445
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,640
好 我太開心了! 什麼角色?
Yeah, I'm thrilled. What's the character?

446
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,310
她是個妓女
She's a hooker?

447
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,740
-妓女?  -對
-A hooker? -Yeah.

448
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,710
沒開玩笑吧 真有意思
No kidding. That's kind of funny.

449
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,610
那 那導演呢?
What... What's like the director?

450
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,520
阿諾德·艾伯森
Arnold Albertson.

451
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,650
阿諾德·艾伯森?
Arnold Albertson?

452
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,790
-是啊 他很厲害的 -我從沒聽說過他啊
-Yeah. He's very good. -Never heard of him.

453
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,630
-他可是頂尖導演之一 -好吧
-He's one of the best. -Okay.

454
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,590
-拜 -好 拜
-Bye. -All right, bye.

455
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,660
好吧 法官 別擔心 我會跟著她
Okay, judge, don't worry. I'll follow her.

456
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,630
你還在跟進這個案子 我現在感覺好多了
I feel better now that you're still on the case.

457
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,910
-嗨 德裏克 -嗨
-Hi, Derek. -Hi.

458
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,080
記得我嗎? 伊麗莎白!
Remember me? Elizabeth!

459
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,850
伊麗莎白 對 我們...
Elizabeth, right. We...

460
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,750
喂松鼠吃堅果?
Squirrels To The Nuts?

461
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,320
天吶 是啊!
My God, yes!

462
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,550
對 芝加哥
Yes, Chicago.

463
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,960
不 達拉斯
No, Dallas.

464
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,590
達拉斯 沒錯 對 對
Dallas, that's right. Yes. Yes.

465
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,860
你最近還好嗎?
How have you been?

466
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,000
我最近還好嗎?
How have I been?

467
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,960
-你完全改變了我的整個人生!  -是嗎?
-You absolutely changed my entire life! -Have I?

468
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,470
我真不敢相信我現在又撞見你了
I can't believe I'm running into you right now.

469
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:25,500
我用那筆錢開了個服裝行 我剛從巴黎回來
I started a dress line with that money. I just got back from Paris.

470
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,410
我現在正要去裏約開新店!  我最近還好嗎?
I'm going to Rio to start a deal! How have I been?

471
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,010
好吧 很高興見到你 我...
Well, it's great to see you, I'm just...

472
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,910
德裏克 我怎麼聯繫你?
Derek, how do I find you?

473
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:35,510
我覺得我在過去的40年裏 都被問到這同一個問題
I feel like I've been asking myself the same question the last 40 years.

474
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,080
而我依然不知道 但 聽著
And I still don't know, but listen,

475
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,090
我現在有點急事 但我們 還有達拉斯的回憶
I'm just rushing off, but we'll always have Dallas

476
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,020
所以 我很高興能夠幫到你
and I'm so happy I was able to help.

477
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,660
好吧 再次感謝你
Okay, well, thank you again.

478
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,560
-希望能再見到你 -我知道
-And I hope I see you again. -I know.

479
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,080
好 好...
Okay. Okay...

480
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,600
所以 也還有其他人 他幫助過我 也幫助過她們
So there were others. He helped me and he helped them.

481
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,630
我不是說 他這麼做是對的
And I'm not saying what he did was right.

482
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,900
我並沒有護著他
I'm not defending him.

483
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,140
但他純粹是為了高興而這麼做
But he did it for the high,

484
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,370
而每次高興過後 就是毀滅
and after every high there always comes the crash.

485
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,610
阿諾德!
Arnold!

486
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,610
坐飛機還順利嗎?
How was the flight?

487
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,880
我的一個客戶給了我一次 一生的治療 作為禮物
One of my clients gave me a lifetime of therapy as a gift.

488
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,690
我的治療師是個酒鬼
And my therapist was a drunk.

489
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:17,720
所以她就離開去戒酒了 她的女兒 珍妮醫生接手了她的工作
So she left to dry out. Her daughter took over, Dr. Jane.

490
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,760
而且她寫了這本書
And she wrote this book

491
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,930
《找到你的柔軟面》 你知道這本書嗎?
finding your softer side. Do you know it?

492
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,000
-不知道 -大暢銷書
-No. -Big best-seller.

493
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,600
她看起來是個很可愛的女人 而且我和她聊天很興奮
She seemed like a sweet woman and I was excited to talk to her.

494
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:35,610
是啊 是啊 我媽媽已經去了3個月了
Yes, yes. My mother has been gone for three months.

495
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,940
如果你想和我聊 可以
If you would like to talk to me, fine.

496
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,710
如果你不想和我聊 也可以
If you would not like to talk to me, that's fine.

497
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,450
-你決定了嗎?  -不
-Have you decided? -No.

498
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,180
不 我是說 我想和你聊聊
No. I mean, I'd like to talk to you.

499
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,550
她去年和一個性感的瑜伽老師
She'd been through a rough break up the year before

500
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,920
分手了
with a hot yoga teacher.

501
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,790
我是說 瑜伽很性感 不是指那個老師
Well, I mean, the yoga was hot, not the teacher.

502
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,920
事實上 那個老師也很性感 但這不是重點
Well, actually, the teacher was, too, but that's not the point.

503
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:57,200
他們在課上認識的 他開始給她上私人課程
They meet in class, and he starts to give her these private lessons.

504
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,630
然後就開始一起住了 結果是
And then they move in together. It turns out

505
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,900
他也給其他的女人上私人課程
he had been giving every other woman in the class private lessons, too.

506
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,870
你能想像嗎?
Can you imagine?

507
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,980
我是說 她的新書叫 《犯賤之美》也就不奇怪了
I mean, no wonder her latest book is called Bitchy Is Beautiful.

508
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,810
那本書我看過 對
That one I read. Yeah.

509
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:14,680
-好吧 請坐 -好 謝謝
-All right, have a seat. -Yeah, thanks.

510
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,120
我看了你的文件 你叫什麼來著?
So, I've taken a look at your file. What's your name again?

511
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,690
伊莎
Izzy.

512
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,520
那是昵稱嗎? 全名叫什麼?
That's short for something. What's your full name?

513
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,690
抱歉你說什麼?
I beg your pardon?

514
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,620
你全名叫什麼? 集中注意
What's your full name? Pay attention!

515
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,720
我叫伊莎貝拉
My name is Isabella.

516
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,090
好 伊莎貝拉
There. Isabella.

517
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,130
而你把它縮減為伊莎
And you've cut it down to Izzy.

518
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,160
那意味著你把你身上的可愛之處縮減了
That means you are cutting off the sweet part of yourself

519
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:36,240
因為伊莎貝拉很甜美 而伊莎很堅硬
because Isabella is so sweet and Izzy is so hard.

520
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,700
這就能看出你的一些性格
There's some insight into your personality right there.

521
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,710
似乎你對你甜美的一面感到不牢靠
It seems that you're insecure with your sweet self,

522
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:43,240
所以你強調那個堅強的自己
so you're emphasizing your tough self.

523
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,810
我說的對不對? 你文件在哪呢?
Am I right or am I wrong? Where's your file?

524
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,050
好吧...
Okay...

525
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:52,820
亦稱為戈爾...為什麼還有別名?
A.K.A. Glo stick... Why A.K.A. Anyway? Do...

526
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,920
應召女郎?
Call girl?

527
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,090
好噁心
Well, that's disgusting.

528
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,260
我是說 你在做那種事的時候什麼感覺
I mean, how do you feel when you're even doing that?

529
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,600
說真的
Honestly.

530
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,830
這份工作有任何積極點嗎?
Are there any up sides to this job?

531
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:10,500
積極點非常多啊 這真的不算問題
Well, there were a lot of ups... That wasn't really the problem.

532
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,770
你不能在做心理治療的時候開玩笑
You don't joke in therapy.

533
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:16,540
我只是 有點緊張
I'm just... I'm feeling kind of nervous.

534
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,140
你知道 明天我有個真的很重要的面試
You know, I've got this really important audition tomorrow.

535
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,780
什麼? 你要面試當應召女郎?
What? So you're auditioning to be a call girl?

536
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,980
不 不 不 我那樣做
No, no, no. I do that on the side,

537
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,550
只是為了幫助我演戲
like, just to kind of support my acting.

538
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:29,220
所以你是要去試鏡
So you have an audition.

539
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,090
-什麼角色?  -應召女郎
-What's the role? -A call girl.

540
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,560
等等 我剛問過你了
Wait, I just asked you that.

541
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,760
我知道 真的很諷刺
I know, it's so ironic,

542
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,700
但人生有時候就是這樣
but life is like that sometimes.

543
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,830
好吧 那太好了 至少你經驗豐富
All right, well that's great. At least you have a lot of experience.

544
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,540
該死!
Shit!

545
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,240
-稍等 -喂? 嗨!
-Hold on a second. -Hello? Hi!

546
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,970
你聽得到嗎?
Can you hear me?

547
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,910
我猜你可能正在做治療
I guess you're probably in a session.

548
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,850
好極了 是我媽 她喝醉了!
Great, it's my mother. She's drunk!

549
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,220
他會咬人嗎?
Does he bite?

550
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,250
我不知道 要看情況
I don't know. It depends.

551
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,790
好吧 因為...
Yeah, 'cause...

552
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,560
你在幹什麼? 抱歉!
What are you doing? Excuse me!

553
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,890
請從椅子上下來
Please get off the chair.

554
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,890
-你瘋了嗎?  -我真的不太喜歡狗
-Are you insane? -I don't really like dogs.

555
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,770
不喜歡狗
Don't like dogs.

556
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,770
過來 過來
Come on. Come on.

557
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,740
快點 走 走!
Go on, scram! Scram.

558
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,970
快點
Come on.

559
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,840
老天 毫無疑問 你真是神經過敏
God, you're neurotic, that's for sure.

560
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,610
我媽媽正從比薩的一家 戒癮所給我打電話
My mother's calling from a Detox Center outside of Pisa.

561
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,590
喂 我真的需要找個人
Hello, I really need to speak to somebody

562
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,350
說說我的強迫癥問題 也許我可以預約
about my obsessional problem. Maybe I could make an appointment.

563
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,620
我現在瀕臨崩潰邊緣 非常崩潰
I'm on the Verge here... The very Verge.

564
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,730
這聲音聽起來好熟悉啊
That voice sounds so familiar...

565
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:43,760
是啊 它現在也開始讓我 聽起來覺得熟悉了
Yeah, well, it's starting to sound way too familiar to me.

566
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,030
這傢伙完全是個笨蛋
That guy is a total loon!

567
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,140
但我不能說我客戶的壞話
But I cannot talk about my clients.

568
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,970
我不能說我的客戶
I cannot talk about my clients...

569
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:54,240
因為這很隱私
Because that's private.

570
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,140
所以我不能告訴你那是誰 所以別問我
So I can't tell you who it is, so don't ask me.

571
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:59,140
現在 我說到哪了?
Now, where was I?

572
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:03,850
如果你願意接受自己柔軟的一面
So if you would just embrace the softer side of yourself,

573
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:06,090
不再生活在堅硬的邊緣
and stop living on that hard edge,

574
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,050
你的狀態會好一些
you would be in such better shape.

575
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,960
開始叫自己伊莎貝拉
Just start calling yourself Isabella

576
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,030
也許你能解決很多 也許不是全部的問題
and you may solve many, if not all, of your problems.

577
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:17,060
今天我已經放棄當應召女郎了
Well, today I've stopped being a call girl.

578
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,900
太好了!
That's great!

579
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,100
太棒了! 你看到治療的好處了吧?
That's great! You see how therapy works!

580
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,910
就像...就像一塊瑞士表
It's like a... It's like a swiss clock.

581
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:29,340
太棒了 你不再需要治療了 我們的療程結束了
That's fabulous. You don't need therapy any more. We're finished.

582
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,940
給自己找條大狗 他們是很好的伴侶
Just get yourself a large dog... They're great company.

583
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,050
祝賀你 伊莎...伊莎貝拉
Congratulations, Izzy... Isabella.

584
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,750
你畢業了
You've graduated.

585
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,020
那個 你的名字是人們首先 瞭解到你的事
Well, your name is the first thing people learn about you.

586
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,390
你知道 這是他們看待你 覺得你是什麼樣的人的依據
You know, it's how they think of you. It's who you are.

587
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,020
珍妮告訴我的 但...
Dr. Jane gave me that, but...

588
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:49,330
我不再是來自布魯克林的伊莎怪人了
I wasn't going to be Izzy Finklestein from Brooklyn any more.

589
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:53,170
我將做伊莎貝拉·帕特森
I was going to be Isabella Patterson.

590
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,830
從我想開始的地方開始
From wherever I wanted to be.

591
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,150
見到你太高興了!
What a thrill to see you walk in!

592
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:13,450
-德爾塔 你認識喬什?  -當然
-Delta, you know Josh? -Of course.

593
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,390
約書亞 你的劇越來越好了
Your play's only gotten better, Joshua.

594
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,220
謝謝! 等不及看到你表演了
Thank you! I can't wait to see you do it.

595
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,060
嘿 夥計們 抱歉 我遲到了
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.

596
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,790
當然 你們都認識賽斯
And you know Seth, of course.

597
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,930
我們認識嗎? 自從倫敦以後 多久沒見了?
Do we know each other? How long's it been since London?

598
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,230
太久了 親愛的
Too long, dear.

599
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,370
過來
Come here.

600
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,970
很高興見到你
Nice to meet you.

601
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,900
我們去把大家都召齊吧 珊迪!
Let's get everybody going. Sandy!

602
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,440
-你看起來美極了 -賽斯 你真會說話
-You're looking gorgeous. -Seth, you're such a charmer.

603
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,110
好吧 但願如此
Well, I hope so.

604
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,880
你知道賽斯·吉爾伯特會去試鏡嗎?
Did you know Seth Gilbert was going to be at the audition?

605
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,750
不 不知道
No. No idea.

606
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,150
我甚至不知道繼那些電影之後 他還演戲
I didn't even know he did theater any more, since those movies.

607
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:46,020
記得他有個穿著粉色蝴蝶袖
What's the one where he had like pink, fluffy sleeves

608
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,720
腰帶上還掛著小蜜蜂的造型嗎?
and the trained Bumble Bee in his belt buckle?

609
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,420
-《紅峰俠》?  -對...
-Red Bee man? -Yeah...

610
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,930
看完5部之後 我就不再關注他了
Well, after all five of those I sort of stopped following him.

611
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,030
那德爾塔·西蒙斯呢?
What about Delta Simmons?

612
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,230
你想聽一些真正有趣的事嗎?
You want, you want to hear something really funny?

613
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,000
當然
Sure.

614
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,370
又一次 她去了沙龍 我媽媽給她洗頭
One time, she comes into the salon and my ma washes her hair.

615
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:05,800
於是就有了媽媽和德爾塔 在假火爐上的照片
So we got this picture of ma and Delta above the fake fireplace.

616
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,440
說說宇宙力量吧
Talk about cosmic forces...

617
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,810
現在我有機會跟她合作
Now, I had the chance to work with her.

618
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,750
這就是命運 但我一直沒有機會告訴她
It was fate, but I never got to tell her.

619
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,190
讓我問你一個問題
"Let me just ask you one question.

620
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:23,860
你答不答應 任何時候當我問...
"Do you promise that whenever I ask the...

621
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,490
任何時候當我告訴你什麼
"Whenever I tell you something

622
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:28,930
你永遠會站在我身旁 而且你永遠不會...
"that you'll always stand by me and that you'll never be...

623
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:34,800
你永遠會是我的朋友 而且你永遠...
"That you'll always be my friend, and that you'll always...

624
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,470
你是否答應不管我告訴你什麼...
Do you promise that no matter what I tell you..."

625
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,040
製片人的女兒
Producer's daughters...

626
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,540
你是否答應無論如何 你永遠會是我的朋友
"Do you promise that no matter what, you'll always be my friend..."

627
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,780
太好了 謝謝 很完美
Great, thank you. That was excellent.

628
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,980
我覺得你有點年輕 不過太感謝你來了
I think you're a little bit young, but thanks so much for coming in.

629
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,280
-謝謝 -謝謝
-Thank you! -Thank you!

630
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,980
很好 親們
Very good, darlings.

631
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,920
好 珊迪 下一個
Okay, Sandy, next!

632
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,820
這是伊莎貝拉·帕特森
This is Isabella Patterson.

633
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,300
天啊
Goodness!

634
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,800
嘿 嘿
Hey, hey, hey!

635
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,370
我們開始了
There we are.

636
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,270
-抱歉 我太緊張了 -別緊張 放鬆點
-Sorry. I'm so nervous. -Don't be nervous. Just relax.

637
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:13,140
天啊 不 該死
Jesus, no! God damn it!

638
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,510
她不對
She's not right.

639
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:17,010
-為什麼?  -因為她不是合適的類型
-Why not? -Because she's not the right type.

640
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:19,950
-喬什 -我覺得她樣貌很適合
-Josh... -I think she looks great for it.

641
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,580
放鬆點
Just relax.

642
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,020
準備好了嗎 伊莎貝拉?
Are you okay, Isabella?

643
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,360
如果你不舒服...
If you're not feeling well...

644
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,190
珊迪 為什麼不給她點信息
Sandy, why don't we get her information

645
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,430
然後下次等你更有感覺的時候再來呢
and come back another time when you're feeling more up for it.

646
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,230
不幸的是她病了
She's sick, unfortunately.

647
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,200
不不 我更想今天就完成
No, no, I'd rather do it today

648
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,070
因為我今天觀星
because I looked at astrology zone today

649
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:44,300
星象告訴我今天對我來說 是個特別的日子
and it said it was going to be a special day for me.

650
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,510
好吧 我們不想就這個問題爭吵
Okay, well, we don't want to argue with that.

651
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,910
繼續吧
Let's proceed.

652
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,140
也許會收到驚喜呢
Maybe we'll get surprised.

653
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,340
我準備了3場戲
So, I've prepared three scenes.

654
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,010
我們只拍一場 因為現在壓力很大
We're only going to do one because we're under a lot of pressure.

655
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,950
好吧
Okay...

656
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:00,120
那我要演哪個?
So which one should I do?

657
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,060
阿諾德 你覺不覺得我們應該 先拍我的親密戲?
Arnold, don't you think we should do the intimate scene with me?

658
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:08,230
不不 我們要拍兩個女人那場
No, no. We're going to do the scene with the two women.

659
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:11,560
你看著很眼熟 你最近是不是去過巴克利銀行?
You look familiar. Were you at the barclay recently?

660
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:12,970
沒
No.

661
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,900
賽斯 這場戲裏沒你
Seth, you're not in this scene.

662
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:19,200
你可以深呼吸一下 咱們讓女士們開始吧
So, why don't you take a breather and we'll let the ladies begin.

663
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,410
對不起
I'm sorry.

664
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,880
你沒事吧 親愛的? 要歇會嗎?
Are you okay, dear? Do you need a second?

665
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,250
-不用 -你確定?
-No. -Sure?

666
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,650
對 我沒事
Yeah, I'm fine.

667
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,590
你真的不要喝一杯?
"You sure you don't want a drink?"

668
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,500
不不 我只是不知道從哪開始
"No, no. I just don't know where to start."

669
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,530
你想從哪開始都行
"Well, start anywhere you like."

670
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:54,110
我只是不知道一切是 怎麼發生的 但是...
"I just don't know how it all happened, but...

671
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,640
這是個很希臘式的夜晚
"It was sort of a very grecian evening.

672
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,910
你看
"You see,

673
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:05,350
我這有一大堆工作...
"I got into this line of work where you usually...

674
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,550
在你見證自己最終的命運之前?
"You don't know who you're going to end up with

675
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,290
你不知道自己最後會遇到什麼人
"until you get to your destination.

676
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:12,260
有點像是喜歡 但不親密
Sort of like a temp, but more intimate."

677
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,360
你說什麼呢
"What are you talking about?"

678
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:19,130
這挺難的
"Well, this is really difficult.

679
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:23,970
因為你是我非常親密的朋友 我真的會把一切都告訴你
"Because you are my very close friend and I do tell you everything

680
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,440
所以我才要告訴你這個
"and that's why I'm telling you this.

681
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,210
不然如果我不在乎你 我也不會告訴你
"Otherwise if I didn't care for you, I wouldn't tell you.

682
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,110
我本來可以永遠是你最好的朋友
"And I could go on forever being your best friend

683
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:32,340
你真的不會知道 但我真的需要告訴你
"and you really wouldn't have to know, but I really need to tell you."

684
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,450
-你說什麼呢 -這...
-"What are you talking about?" -"Well...

685
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,320
我以前是應召女郎
"I was a call girl

686
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,690
而且我就是個陰招女郎
"and I pretty much am a call girl."

687
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,990
應召女郎!
"A call girl!"

688
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,730
我問你一個問題
"Let me just ask you one question.

689
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,530
不管我說什麼
"No matter what I say,

690
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:54,200
請別用有色眼鏡看我
"Please don't judge me

691
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,040
不管我告訴你什麼 答應我 你永遠會是我的朋友
"And whatever I tell you, promise me you'll always be my friend

692
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,670
你會永遠站在我身邊
"and you'll always stand by me."

693
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:01,140
當然 什麼都行
"Of course. Anything.

694
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,210
我在乎你
"I care about you.

695
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:06,010
但我也非常非常震驚
"But I'm also very, very shocked.

696
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,610
我還感覺難過 那些墮落的混蛋
"And I also feel so sad. Those rotten bastards!"

697
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,350
這麼說吧
"Put it this way.

698
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,250
你想不想聽壞消息?
"Do you want the bad news?

699
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,090
或者很壞很壞的消息?
"Or the bad, bad news?

700
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,220
還是你想聽最壞最壞的消息?
"Or do you want the bad, bad, bad news?"

701
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,020
天啊 還有嗎
"My God, there's more?

702
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,190
好吧 就說壞消息吧
"Okay, give me the bad news."

703
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,460
避孕套破了
"The condom broke."

704
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,730
-不 -沒錯
-"No..." -"Yeah.

705
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,730
很壞很壞的消息是我懷孕了
"And the bad, bad news is that I'm pregnant."

706
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,740
-天啊 -是啊
-"God!" -"Yeah..."

707
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,040
看來我要當阿姨了 也沒那麼糟
"Well, I guess I'll be an auntie... That's not so bad."

708
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,240
那...
"Well...

709
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,440
最壞最壞的消息?
"The bad, bad, bad news?"

710
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,650
什麼?
"Yes?"

711
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,520
天啊...
"Gosh..."

712
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,050
什麼? 告訴我
"What? Tell me."

713
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,360
爸爸是你的弗雷德
"It was your Fred.

714
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,230
請別恨我 也別恨他
"Please don't hate me. And don't hate him.

715
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:56,560
這只是生活中遇到的那種
"It was just one of those crazy, stupid, weird things

716
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,100
瘋狂 愚蠢 怪異的事情
"that happen to you in life

717
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,400
你無法預測 也不能批判
"and you can't predict it and you can't judge it!

718
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,470
所以求你 求你別恨我
"So please... Please don't hate me."

719
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:10,740
太聰明了 親愛的 太棒了
That was brilliant, darling. That was so good!

720
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,380
親愛的 她是不是演得很好 阿諾德?
Darling. Wasn't she so good, Arnold?

721
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,310
很好
Very good.

722
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,620
很好
Very good.

723
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,450
非常感謝你來 我們要遲了 所以..
Thank you so much for coming, we're running late, so...

724
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:22,390
我送她出去 珊迪 你把 下一個女孩帶進來
I'll show her out, Sandy. You bring in the next girl.

725
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,560
-很好 伊莎貝拉 -多謝

726
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,790

-Yeah. Bye. -Goodbye!

727
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,430
嘿 我送你出去
Hey, I'll walk you out.

728
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,530
幹得好
Well done.

729
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,830
她是不是很棒?
Wasn't she good?

730
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:36,270
是的 非常棒 無可匹敵
She was. Very. She nailed it!

731
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,600
她是不是很棒 阿諾德?
Wasn't she good, Arnold?

732
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,510
她確實不錯
I did think she was good.

733
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,140
她真的感動我了
She really moved me.

734
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:48,110
好吧 下一個是誰? 咱們繼續
Okay, so what's next? Let's move on...

735
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,590
-那麼 你是應召女郎?  -在戲裏是
-So, you were a call girl? -In the play.

736
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,590
不 你暗示的可不是那樣
No, that's not what you've been implying.

737
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,260
對 不是 伊莎是應召女
Yeah, no. Izzy was. Yeah.

738
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,630
但你是伊莎
But you're Izzy.

739
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,730
我是
I am.

740
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:14,110
那你今晚有沒有空來吃個晚飯?
So, are you by any chance free for dinner tonight?

741
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,510
我不知道 估計有吧
I don't know. Yeah, I guess.

742
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,710
好 好
Good. Good.

743
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,780
你今天的表演太震撼了
I was so impressed with that reading today.

744
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:25,620
不過說實話 在試鏡之前 我就已經對你印象深刻了 所以...
But, to be honest, I was impressed before the reading too, so...

745
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,190
多謝
Well, thanks a lot.

746
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,390
嗯
Yeah.

747
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,860
你是不是很瞭解阿諾德·艾伯森?
Do you know Arnold Albertson that well?

748
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,660
對 我瞭解他 但不是特別瞭解
Yeah, I know him. But not very well.

749
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,530
他幫我做這部戲一年了 怎麼了?
He's helped me with the play for a year. Why?

750
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:41,900
沒什麼 只是他看起來像個好人
Nothing. He just seemed like a really nice guy.

751
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,470
對 尼西亞意大利的嗎?
Yeah... Do you like italian?

752
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,910
意大利菜
Food.

753
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:49,540
好啊 當然
Yeah, sure.

754
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,810
第五大道的尼克飯店怎麼樣?
How about Nicks on Fifth?

755
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,410
還是我去你家接你?
Or should I pick you up at home?

756
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:56,350
不不 我在飯店見你吧
No, no, no. I'll meet you at the restaurant.

757
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,380
-幾點?  -8點?
-What time? -Eight o'clock?

758
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,620
好 沒問題 到時候見
Okay, sure. I'll see you then.

759
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,820
好 不過別告訴其他人我約了你
Okay. Don't tell anybody, but I'm rooting for you.

760
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,660
非常感謝
Thanks a lot.

761
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,260
-回頭見 -好
-I'll see you later. -Okay.

762
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,400
再見
Bye.

763
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,900
你知不知道電影《蒂凡尼的早餐》?
Do you know the movie breakfast at Tiffany's?

764
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,590
-知道 -這...
-Yes. -Well...

765
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:22,270
他們在城裏什麼地方放 我看到張海報
They were playing it somewhere downtown and I see this poster

766
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,210
上面的奧德麗美極了
of Audrey looking so gorgeous.

767
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,180
所以我就買了張票進場
So I bought a ticket and I went in.

768
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,180
連續幾星期這部電影 都在我腦海裏揮之不去
And, for weeks I couldn't get this movie out of my head, you know?

769
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,450
她把一切都掌握在手心裏
She had everything under control.

770
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:34,320
所有問題都搞定了 她什麼都不需要
Everything figured out, she didn't need anything...

771
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,250
她是個應召女郎
She is a call girl.

772
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:42,430
也許她只是一個喜歡喝酒跳舞
Well, maybe she was just somebody who liked to have a drink and a dance

773
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,300
傳播快樂的女孩
and spread happiness,

774
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,460
如果有個人願意在她去 化妝間的路上塞給她50塊
and if a guy was going to give her 50 on the way to the powder room

775
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:50,340
那也是她應得的 因為她 觸碰了他們的生活
then she deserved it because she touched their lives.

776
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,340
我很清楚這是一種癡迷
I'm perfectly aware that it's an obsession.

777
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,710
但也許我對那個女人本人更瞭解
But maybe if I knew more about the woman herself...

778
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,240
對 那這個讓她
Yes, what is it about this woman

779
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,510
如此沉迷的女人到底有什麼特別的
that makes her so goddamn obsessionable?

780
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,350
她說話不像我奶奶
She doesn't sound like my grandmother.

781
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,510
什麼?
Say, what?

782
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,680
我認識的每個女人說話都像我奶奶
Every woman I've ever known sounds like my grandmother,

783
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,620
除了這個
except for this one.

784
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,750
戈爾
Glo...

785
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,750
戈爾?
Glo?

786
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,690
"螢光棒"那種?
As in Glo stick?

787
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,690
是的 怎麼了
Why, yes. Why?

788
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,960
我的天
My God.

789
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,530
"我的天"什麼意思
What do you mean, "My God?"

790
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:20,300
我是說 天啊 太棒了
I mean... My God! That's terrific!

791
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,630
真是個好名字
What a terrific... Terrific name.

792
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,870
對 那名字可不是人人都能想到的
Yeah, you don't come across that name too often.

793
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:29,510
不 但你的治療 看上去是很普通的療程
No, but in therapy you do. It's kinda common in therapy.

794
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,280
你知道"螢光棒"?
You know a Glo stick?

795
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,510
對 我知道好嗎?  實際上我就是她的治療師
Yes, I do. Okay? In fact, I am her therapist.

796
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:37,250
但專業原因讓我無法討論
But professional reasons make it impossible for me to discuss

797
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,350
有關她的任何話題
anything whatsoever to do with her.

798
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,950
但她是個很好的女人
She's a very nice woman, however.

799
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:43,320
她有點神經質 而且有一些別的小問題
She's a little neurotic and she has got quite a few problems

800
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,920
並且需要接觸她內心柔軟的部分
and she needs to get in touch with her softer side.

801
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:48,490
但那...那是隱私 那是隱私 我是醫生
But that's... That's private! That is private! I am a doctor.

802
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,430
醫生不能討論病人的私生活
Doctors do not discuss their patients' private lives.

803
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:54,630
要是我的下一個客人跑進來
How would you like it if I my next client walked in here

804
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,500
聽到我說剛走出去的那個人
and I said that the guy that just walked out of here

805
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,370
是個癡迷於名叫"螢光棒"的 女人的變態怪胎會怎麼想?
Is a lunatic weirdo obsessed with a woman named Glo stick?

806
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,640
你會怎麼想?
How would you like that?

807
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,540
這...
Well...

808
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,980
順便 我覺得不管這女孩多有魅力
And by the way, I don't think that this girl, however attractive,

809
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,750
都不值得你這樣跪舔
is worth being obsessed about.

810
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,680
特別是不能用其他人的婚姻觀來評判她
Especially for a married judge of other humans.

811
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,590
我不是有偏見 但這就是太愚蠢了
Now, I'm not judgmental, but that's just stupid!

812
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,420
是我 喬什 能借嗎
It's me, Josh. Can you pick up?

813
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,720
看我這治療師幹得多棒
See what a good therapist I am?

814
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,730
那是我男朋友 而且我不打算接
That's my boyfriend and I'm not picking up.

815
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,880
這是你的專屬時間
This is your private time.

816
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,030
我今晚要加班搞這部戲的工作 沒法去吃晚飯了 真對不起
So, I'm kind of stuck with the play tonight and I can't make it for dinner.

817
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,000
什麼意思? 你不能來吃晚飯是什麼意思
What do you mean? What do you mean you can't make it to dinner?

818
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,310
行 你知道嗎? 我餓死算了
Fine! You know what? I'll starve.

819
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,510
我以前就挨過餓 再挨餓算什麼
I've starved before, I'll starve again.

820
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,710
最近我經常餓肚子
You know, I've been starving a lot myself lately.

821
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,480
也許我們可以一起挨餓呢
Perhaps we should starve together.

822
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,080
今晚願意跟我一起吃晚飯嗎?
Would you care to have dinner with me tonight?

823
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,680
你平時都吃什麼菜?
What kind of food do you eat?

824
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,080
意大利菜你喜歡嗎?
Do you like italian?

825
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,920
還行
It's all right.

826
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,690
-那麼?  -好吧
-So? -All right.

827
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,820
我去換個衛生棉
I'm going to change my tampon.

828
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,790
對不起 我只是不同意你的
I'm sorry, I just... I don't agree with you.

829
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:56,590
我覺得那個叫帕特森的女孩 就像賽斯說的 "無人能敵"
I just think that Patterson girl "nailed it," as Seth put it.

830
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,560
她身上有種別人都沒有的感覺
I just think that there was something about her that nobody else had.

831
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,670
有種經驗豐富的感覺 就好像她有過那種生活
Kind of an experienced quality. Almost like she'd lived it.

832
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,070
對 我得說 我同意德爾塔 和賽斯的說法
Yeah, I have to say, I agree with Delta and Seth.

833
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:08,010
她確實有些地方非常非常特別
I mean, she had something really, really special.

834
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:10,940
她讓我想起了我在幼兒園 愛上的那個女孩
She reminds me of the girl that I fell in love with in kindergarten.

835
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,110
她是站街女嗎
Was she a hooker?

836
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,050
對 她是幼兒園的站街女
Yeah, she was a kindergarten hooker.

837
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:16,410
這學校有點前衛啊
That sounds like a progressive school.

838
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,420
好了 珊迪 還有誰我們沒討論到
Okay, Sandy, who have we not discussed?

839
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,820
都說到了
You've covered it.

840
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,390
好的 那麼不如今晚就到這 大家回去睡覺
Okay, well, why don't we call it a night and sleep on it.

841
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:26,590
不過那個伊莎
That Izzy, though,

842
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:29,390
我好像在哪見過她
I feel like I know her from somewhere.

843
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,930
她確實有張大眾臉
Well, she did have one of those sort of ordinary faces

844
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,500
很多人都跟她長得像
that are a dime a dozen, so...

845
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,570
我不這麼覺得
I don't think so.

846
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:38,540
那我咋知道 我現在餓得 都沒法思考了
Well, what do I know? I'm so hungry I can't even think straight right now.

847
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,410
好 那就到此為止
Okay, looks like that's a wrap.

848
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,610
好
Okay.

849
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,540
你今天真是前所未有得美
You're looking more beautiful than ever.

850
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,450
我都等不及了 特別是床戲
I can't wait to do this... Especially the love scenes.

851
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:48,650
快走了
Get out of here.

852
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:49,980
謝謝你 導演先生
Well, thank you, Mr. Director,

853
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,020
真是個充滿驚喜的第一天 對吧
that was a very surprising first day, wasn't it?

854
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,950
是的 所以我們才專門 跑到劇院來被驚喜
It sure was, yeah. That's why we go to the theater... To be surprised.

855
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,790
不過 你也許需要在明天
Incidentally, you might find a few more colors

856
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:00,090
你的表演力多拿出點色彩來
in your performance tomorrow in rehearsals.

857
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:02,090
不過今天幹得不錯 我們只是剛開始
But good job today. We're just beginning.

858
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,030
如果我太嚴厲了 對不起
Hey, sorry if I was a little snappy, darling.

859
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,730
不如咱們去吃個浪漫晚餐怎麼樣
But, why don't I make it up with a little romantic dinner?

860
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,050
請問需要什麼 先生
Can I help you, sir?

861
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,750
一人的桌 要那邊的
Table for one, over there.

862
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,090
這邊請
This way, please.

863
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,590
嗨
Hi!

864
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,660
嗨
Hi.

865
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,130
真對不起我遲到了
I'm so sorry I'm late.

866
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:43,740
天啊 你沒事吧
My God, are you all right?

867
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,000
沒事 沒事
It's all right, it's all right.

868
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,200
不不 我扶你起來
No, no... Let me get you up.

869
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,740
您要先來杯水嗎
May I offer you some water?

870
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,540
-不 -威士忌加蘇打?
-No. -Scotch and soda?

871
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,480
-也許吧 -我去叫
-Maybe. -I'll look into it.

872
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,880
-謝謝 -很榮幸
-Thank you. -My pleasure.

873
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,120
真漂亮的飯店
Such a beautiful restaurant.

874
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,630
嗯哼
Ahem!

875
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,870
-你怎麼了?  -沒事 沒事
-What's your problem? -Nothing, nothing...

876
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,540
只是渴了
I'm just... I was thirsty.

877
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,980
謝謝
Thank you.

878
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,680
你怎麼回事?
What is it with you?

879
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,650
我不知道我怎麼了 只是太渴了
I don't know what's the matter with me. I'm just very thirsty.

880
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:38,120
那把杯子拿起來啊 別把杯子推下去
Well, then pick up the glass! Stop pushing it off the table.

881
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,130
你小時候肯定很任性
You must have been such a demanding child.

882
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:44,500
天啊 我餓死了
God, I'm just starving.

883
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,630
反正 就像我說的 我真受不了那些藝術家
Anyway, as I was saying, I'm just so sick of artists.

884
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,200
他們總是讓你失望
They just always let you down.

885
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,570
給我個優秀的商人就行了
Just give me a great businessman.

886
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,540
跟這個劇作家約會 他們寫喜劇
Dating this playwright... They write plays,

887
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,010
卻根本不考慮生活 他們...
they don't think about life, they...

888
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:59,080
你有在聽我的話嗎
Are you listening to anything that I'm saying?

889
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,810
還有為什麼藏在菜單後面
And why are you hiding behind that menu?

890
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,610
我沒有
I'm not!

891
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,950
律師 好人 對 對
Lawyers, good people. Yes. Yes.

892
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:09,650
我只是得改變一下我的生活 我就是這個意思 我必須改變
I just have to change my life, that's all I can say. I have to.

893
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,130
你在看什麼?
What are you looking at?

894
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,660
我沒看錯吧?
Is that who I think it is?

895
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,970
那王八蛋
That son of a bitch!

896
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,810
天啊 你沒事吧?
My gosh! Are you all right?

897
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:32,540
-沒事 沒事 -怎麼今天一個個都倒了
-Yeah, yeah. -Everybody keeps falling down!

898
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,110
喔 真棒啊 我的治療師
Wow, how great! Here's my therapist...

899
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,220
珍妮 聽我說 你得...
Jane, look, you have to...

900
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,920
你被開除了
You're fired!

901
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,660
喬什
Josh!

902
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,960
你沒事吧
Are you okay?

903
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,690
-沒事 我沒事 -你確定?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. -You sure?

904
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,290
-沒事 -你認識她?
-Yeah. -Do you know her?

905
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,660
是啊 我想我認識
Yeah, I guess I do.

906
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,770
別這麼走啊
Don't just leave!

907
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:56,000
你也被開除了
You're fired, too!

908
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,040
看著點鹿
Watch where you're going!

909
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:01,110
你...
You...

910
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,850
我要去趟洗手間
I have got to go to the ladies room.

911
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,890
-你沒事吧 兒子 -爸爸
-Are you all right, son? -Dad!

912
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,790
-你在這幹什麼?  -我在這工作
-What are you doing here? -I work here.

913
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:19,860
-什麼時候開始的?  -說來話長
-From when? -It's a long story,

914
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,190
我們都沒時間聽故事
and neither of us has time for it.

915
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,160
一會見
I'll see you in a minute.

916
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,900
我去趟洗手間
I'm going to use the rest room.

917
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,040
珍妮 等等
Jane! Wait!

918
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:50,960
你好啊 完美試鏡的美女
Well, hello, wonderful reading!

919
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,230
我只是呼吸點新鮮空氣
I was just getting some air.

920
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:56,830
當然
Of course.

921
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,400
喬什 你在這幹什麼?
Josh, what are you doing here?

922
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,400
阿諾德 嗨
Arnold. Hi.

923
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,170
德爾塔總是說這是個好地方
Delta always said this was a great place

924
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:05,870
-所以我就想來嘗嘗看 -是啊 是啊
-so I thought I'd try it. -Yeah, yeah.

925
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:08,270
我跟那個叫伊莎的女孩一起來的 他太讓我震驚了
I'm here with that girl, Izzy. I was so impressed with her.

926
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,910
-她在這?  -對 在女廁所
-She's here? -Yeah. In the ladies room.

927
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,850
耶穌我了個基督啊
Dear God in heaven.

928
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:14,910
什麼?
What?

929
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:18,950
你怎麼...
Why would you...

930
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:21,090
-法官 咱們去走走吧 -我不想走走
-Judge, let's take a little walk. -I don't want a little walk.

931
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:23,220
我要回去看看怎麼回事
I'm going back in there and see what's going on!

932
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,820
現在不行 法官
Not right now, judge.

933
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,660
我聽不懂你的話
Well, I can't follow anything you say.

934
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,760
我們現在就走
Let's not blow it now.

935
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,060
看看我在女廁所找到誰了
Look who I found in the ladies room.

936
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,300
-喬什 -啊
-Josh... -Yeah.

937
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,370
喬什跟我說了
Josh told me.

938
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:36,170
-你好嗎 -很好 謝謝
-How are you? -I'm fine, thanks.

939
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:38,400
-你出手真快 喬什 -不 我只是...
-Fast moves, Josh. -No, I just...

940
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:40,970
你看過菜單了嗎 阿諾德?
Have you had a chance to look at the menu yet, Arnold?

941
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,870
還好我們的孩子愛他們的祖父母
Luckily, our kids love their grandparents,

942
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,680
不過今晚真的應該去接他們 對吧親愛的?
but we really should try to tuck them in tonight, right, darling?

943
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,180
我不太舒服 我還是先走吧
You know, I don't feel too good. I think I'm gonna go.

944
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,380
-不 -對不起
-No. -I'm sorry.

945
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,150
-好好照顧自己 -對
-Feel better. -Yeah.

946
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:53,350
照顧好自己
Feel better.

947
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:56,790
看看誰來了 稍等 迪米特裏
Well, look whose here. One minute, Dmitri.

948
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:58,690
嘿 戈爾 居然是你
Hey, Glo! What do ya know?

949
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:03,190
你在跟我說話? 不 我是伊莎貝拉
You talking to me? No, I'm Isabella.

950
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,730
你們倆認識?
You two know each other?

951
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:05,830
不 不熟
No. Not really.

952
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,470
對 我搞錯了
Yeah, my mistake.

953
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:11,840
大夥兒都到了 開會呢這是
The gang's all here. Of all the gin joints...

954
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,910
德爾塔 你比上次在皮卡迪利大街
Delta, you look even younger now than you did that time in Piccadilly

955
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,940
跟那些孩子們玩的適合還更年輕 你記得嗎?
when you played with those children. Remember?

956
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:19,340
那次很開心 不是嗎
That was fun, wasn't it?

957
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:22,750
很高興見到你嗎 但我真的該走了
It was really nice to see you all, but I gotta go.

958
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,450
-照顧好自己 -對
-Feel better. -Yes.

959
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:26,750
-明天見 -咱們去坐下 弗蘭基
-See you tomorrow. -Let's sit down, Frankie.

960
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,460
阿諾德
Arnold,

961
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,720
弗蘭基是薇琪的朋友
Frankie is friends with Vickie.

962
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,960
我不認識什麼叫薇琪的
I don't know any Vickies.

963
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,990
我的錯
My mistake.

964
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,730
-肯定是認錯人了 -對
-Must be some other guy. -Yeah.

965
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:40,830
今晚好像大家都犯糊塗了 肯定是天氣的問題
Everybody seems to be confused tonight! Must be the weather.

966
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:41,900
是啊
Yeah.

967
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,070
混亂之治
Confusion reigns.

968
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,200
早上見
See you in the morning.

969
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:48,040
晚安 甜美的公主
Good night, sweet princess.

970
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,310
再見
Adieu.

971
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:52,440
晚安
Good night.

972
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:53,810
再見
Adieu.

973
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,010
你為什麼不喜歡那女孩?
Why don't you like that girl?

974
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,850
-哪個女孩 -伊莎貝拉·帕特森
-Which girl? -Isabella Patterson.

975
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:01,050
誰說我不喜歡她?
Who said I don't like her?

976
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,320
你在她身邊就很奇怪
Well, you certainly act weird around her.

977
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,820
奇怪? 我都沒怎麼看過她
Act weird? I barely even looked at her.

978
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:07,790
沒錯
Exactly.

979
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:11,460
這也比跟我們的型男賽斯先生 摟摟抱抱要好
It's better, it's better than swooning over Mr. Seth Seduction.

980
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,370
我是說 他說的話加上你的動作 簡直是最搞笑的東西
I mean, everything he says you act like it's the funniest thing you ever heard.

981
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:16,830
天啊 你總是吃醋
Pish-Tosh... You're always jealous.

982
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,070
為什麼不管說什麼最後都會 扯回到倫敦和皮卡迪利大街
Why is everything always back to London and Piccadilly?

983
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:22,510
還有你們的那段風光時刻
And this glorious time you guys had.

984
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:24,980
那部戲我們配合的很好 你知道的
We had a good time on that play, you know that.

985
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,780
對 我知道 對不起
No, I know. I'm sorry.

986
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,790
他們在那
There they are!

987
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:36,150
-法官 -什麼
-Judge... -What?

988
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,920
很抱歉 但我得告訴你問題出現了
I'm sorry to tell you, but a problem has come up...

989
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,190
那是我兒子
That's my son.

990
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:43,060
那是你兒子?
That's your son?

991
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:46,160
這裏有些東西不符合猶太教義 這事情發生多久了?
There's something not kosher here. How long has this been going on?

992
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:50,130
你說什麼呢? 我半小時前 還什麼都不知道
What are you talking about? I didn't know anything until half an hour ago,

993
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,540
如果你說的是這個
if that's what you're implying.

994
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,040
我聞到了老鼠
I smell a rat.

995
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,270
是嗎? 我也是
Ha, you do? So do I!

996
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,510
-等等 等等 -我受夠了被傷害
-Wait, wait, wait! -I'm tired of being abused.

997
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,150
希望你現在感覺好點了
I hope you're feeling better now.

998
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:03,580
我沒事
Yeah, I'm okay.

999
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,580
但你呢 你什麼都沒吃
But you, you didn't get anything to eat.

1000
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:08,920
要不要進來吃個三明治?
You want to come in and have a sandwich?

1001
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,920
好啊
-Sure. -Okay.

1002
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:14,230
該死的摔跤比賽
God damn wrestling match!

1003
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:15,560
能別抱怨了嗎
Would you stop complaining?

1004
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,430
閉嘴 我都聽不到電視了
Shut up! I can't hear the TV.

1005
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,200
你才閉嘴 去高速公路上玩去
You shut up! Go play on the highway!

1006
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,370
怎麼了?
What's normal?

1007
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:23,500
他是我認識的第一個編劇
He was the first playwright that I ever met.

1008
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,200
而且是個真正的紳士
And he was a true gentleman, you know?

1009
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:29,010
他都沒想過親我 即使我知道他很想
He didn't even try to kiss me, even when I knew he wanted to.

1010
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:31,310
他還說要見見我父親
And, he asked to meet my father.

1011
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,340
從沒人那麼做過
And no one had ever done that before.

1012
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,410
我以前從沒帶男孩進過家門
I never even had a boy in the house before.

1013
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,920
不過...對 他完全就是 我想像中的編劇
But... Yeah, he was exactly what I imagined a playwright to be.

1014
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,390
非常敏感 而且他就像我的 瑪麗琳的亞瑟·米勒
Very sensitive and, he was like the Arthur Miller to my Marilyn.

1015
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:50,860
三明治很好吃 謝謝
That was a great sandwich. Thanks.

1016
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:53,460
你沒事吧? 你好像很傷心
Are you okay? You seem a little sad.

1017
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:56,930
沒事 只是...
Yeah, it's just...

1018
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,870
我覺得可能我得不到那個角色
I don't think I'm gonna get the part.

1019
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:03,270
我覺得很有可能
I feel very optimistic about it.

1020
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,210
你真好
You're very sweet.

1021
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,510
我能給你打電話嗎
May I call you?

1022
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,420
好啊
Yeah.

1023
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,390
當然 為什麼不呢
Sure. Why not?

1024
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:18,990
謝謝你讓我的戲更精彩
Well, thanks for making my play better.

1025
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:23,360
再見 喬什
So long, Josh.

1026
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,920
那個叫洛雷塔的女孩試鏡還不錯
That Loretta girl gave a fair reading...

1027
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,520
伊莎貝拉非常優秀
Isabella gave a brilliant one.

1028
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,420
你今天就要作出決定
You have to make a decision today.

1029
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:53,060
沒有問題 沒人說有問題
It's not a problem. No one said anything about a problem.

1030
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,330
-隻是我得有個過程 好嗎 -過程?
-It's just that I have a process, okay? -A process?

1031
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:57,130
這個過程就從百吉餅開始
And the process begins with a bagel.

1032
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:00,630
-你只要按下扳機 -我吃飯不說話 親愛的
-Pull the rigger, darling. -I'm eating in silence, honey.

1033
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:02,000
-來吧 -阿諾德
-Come on. -Arnold!

1034
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,540
去61大道和麥迪遜大街交叉口
We're going to go to 61st and Madison.

1035
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,410
天氣真不錯 對吧
Lovely day, isn't it?

1036
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:12,210
他很健談 不是嗎
Well, he's a talker, isn't he?

1037
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:13,680
他們給的百吉餅口味錯了
They gave me the wrong bagels...

1038
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,310
我要的是罌粟籽的 他們給了我4個...
I asked for poppy seed. They gave me four...

1039
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,680
你今天心情不錯啊
Boy, are you in a mood today!

1040
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,980
根本沒人吃的東西
Which nobody eats.

1041
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:20,050
告訴我你為什麼不喜歡她?
Tell me why you don't like her?

1042
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:23,290
誰說我不喜歡她?  我只是不想倉促選擇
Who said that I don't like her? I just don't want to make a snap decision.

1043
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:25,290
-倉促選擇 -這太重要了 得一步步來
-A snap decision. -It's too important. It's my process.

1044
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:27,530
是誰總說你得有膽量
Who is the one who always says you have to go with your gut

1045
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:29,530
別瞻前顧後的?
and not think about things too much?

1046
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:31,330
-可不是我說的 -那是直接飲用
-All right, not me. -That was a direct quote...

1047
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:32,230
我才不會那麼說話
I don't talk like that.

1048
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:35,600
-我從沒...談過我的膽量 -你怎麼回事?
-I never... Talk about my gut. -What is wrong with you?

1049
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,500
我沒事 只是壓力太大
There's nothing wrong with me. I am under a great deal of pressure

1050
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,540
我不需要我妻子再給我增加 更多的壓力
and I don't need my wife adding more pressure.

1051
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:42,670
你得承認 這女孩很不一樣
You have to admit, there is something about this girl.

1052
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,510
也許她就是我們前世的守護神
Maybe she was a escort in a past life.

1053
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:47,310
-現在怎麼又扯到前世了 -我不知道
-Now we're talking about past lives? -I don't know.

1054
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:49,480
怎麼了? 司機哪去了?
What's going on? Where's the driver?

1055
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:52,080
那是他嗎?
Is that him?

1056
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:55,020
對 是他 但他這是去哪?
Yeah, that's him. But where's he going?

1057
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,360
他好像上出租了
He seems to be getting into a cab.

1058
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,220
這是我見過最扯淡的事情 什麼...
This is the craziest thing I've ever seen. What...

1059
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,560
是我們說錯什麼了嗎
Was it something we said?

1060
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,100
必須是啊
Apparently...

1061
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,600
要麼是我們說錯話了 要麼是我們 就要被黑幫炸死了
Either that or it's a mob hit and we're about to blow up.

1062
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,370
下車 下車
Yeah, well, get out. Get out.

1063
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:13,270
這是什麼啊 搞行為藝術的出租司機嗎
What is this, like a existential cab driver.

1064
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:16,170
他好像受不了我們拌嘴
I think he couldn't take the tension between us.

1065
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,210
可能那就是他的過程
I know, maybe that was his process.

1066
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:20,110
好吧 我就把那該死的角色給她
Okay, I'll give her the goddamn part!

1067
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:21,750
這樣就決定了?
That's all it took?

1068
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:24,420
-對 -她欠那司機10美分
-Yeah. -She owes that cabbie ten percent.

1069
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,320
喂?
Hello?

1070
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,390
珊迪?
Sandy?

1071
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:33,660
你不是開玩笑吧?
You're not kidding, are you?

1072
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:37,160
明天
Tomorrow.

1073
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,500
早上10點
10:00 A.M.

1074
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,430
好 太感謝了
Okay! Thank you so much!

1075
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:44,140
好 再見
Okay, bye now.

1076
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,100
-我得到角色了!  -什麼角色?
-I got the part! -What part?

1077
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:49,110
-百老匯!  -百老匯?
-Broadway! -Broadway?

1078
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:50,710
你就是那麼得到角色的?
So that's how you got the part?

1079
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:52,110
他是那麼告訴我的 對
That's what he told me, yeah.

1080
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:53,810
-你相信了他?  -對
-And you believed him? -Yeah!

1081
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:55,650
這挺有意思的
I think... It's kind of funny,

1082
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:58,120
但我真的想不出來你要怎麼 編那麼大一個故事
but I really don't see how you can make a story like that up.

1083
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,520
就跟你編個名字 或者瞞著妻子搞外遇那樣
The same way you make up a name or cheat on your wife.

1084
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,750
他騙了你
He lied to you!

1085
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,460
我不知道我能不能接受你這說法
I don't know if I agree with you, actually.

1086
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,490
因為阿諾德跟我是在一個 非常特別的環境下認識的
Because Arnold and I met under very specific circumstances.

1087
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:10,090
而且他不欠我什麼
And he didn't owe me anything.

1088
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,760
特別是不欠我真相
Especially not the truth.

1089
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,500
他完全沒必要把那角色給我
And he certainly didn't have to give me that part.

1090
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,630
他肯定也不該給我
And he probably shouldn't have,

1091
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,130
這後來給他帶來了那麼多傷心事
for all the grief that it caused him.

1092
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:34,120
別叫 聽我解釋
Now, don't yell... Let me explain.

1093
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,320
不
Nope!

1094
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,490
不 不
No. No.

1095
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:37,720
不 出去
No. Get out!

1096
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,460
-我... -不
-I was... -No!

1097
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:42,130
你是我見過最惡劣的人之一
You are one of the most horrible people I've ever met...

1098
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:46,260
不 實際上 你知道嗎 你就是我 見過的最惡劣的人
No, in fact, you know what, you are the most horrible person I have ever met.

1099
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:50,500
你推掉我們的晚飯就為了 跟我的病人一起吃飯?
You cancel our dinner to go out with one of my sick patients.

1100
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,700
你知不知道這只讓我感到 你是多麼噁心
Do you know that only tells me how sick you are!

1101
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,510
天啊 我只想把這個捅進你的蛋蛋裏
God, I just want to shove this up your cock!

1102
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:58,710
珍妮 看在上帝的份上 這都是為了我的戲
Jane, for God's sake, it all has to do with my play.

1103
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:00,480
你的戲?
Your play?

1104
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,410
我才不在乎你的什麼戲
I don't care about your play!

1105
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,720
你愚蠢的戲劇 我也不在乎你
Your stupid little play, I don't care about you.

1106
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,220
給我滾
Just get out!

1107
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:08,490
不
No.

1108
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:10,790
-喂?  -你好大的膽子 在我的辦公室
-Hello? -How dare you answer your cellphone

1109
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:12,360
接電話!
in my office!

1110
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,790
太好了 我真為你感到高興
That's great! I'm so happy for you.

1111
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:16,630
現在你又開心了
And now you're happy.

1112
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:19,530
現在他開心了 跟我在一起 你總是苦瓜臉 為什麼?
Now he's happy. You're always depressed with me. Why is that?

1113
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:20,830
為什麼? 那是誰?
Why is that? Who is that?

1114
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:23,170
我現在不方便說話 一會再打給我
I can't talk right now. Call me later.

1115
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:25,140
是那個金髮瘋婆子嗎
Was that the crazy blond?

1116
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,370
還是那個飢渴的老爹?
Or the needy father?

1117
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:28,210
珍妮 我必須跟你談談
Jane, I must talk to you!

1118
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:31,310
天啊 你知道嗎 我看到你們倆就噁心 都給我滾
God, you know what? I'm so sick of both of you. Just get out!

1119
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,340
你們倆 滾
All of you, get out!

1120
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:35,450
滾出去
Just get out!

1121
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:36,810
好
Okay.

1122
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,880
出去
Out!

1123
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:43,490
真受不了這麼緊的衣服
I'm sick of these tight clothes.

1124
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:45,490
我得換身寬鬆的
I've gotta get a loose-fitting suit or something.

1125
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:47,190
不然就去做個抽脂手術
Either that or it's liposuction.

1126
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:49,590
你身材這麼好 得了便宜還賣乖
Come on, you look great. You're fishing for compliments.

1127
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,730
-別說啦 -你這乖賣的太大了
-Stop it! -Harpooning is more like it.

1128
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:54,570
嘿 兩位陌生人 你們在這幹啥呢
Hey, you two strangers, what are you doing here?

1129
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:56,930
我知道你在這幹什麼
Well, I know what you're doing here.

1130
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,570
升職 升職
Promotion, promotion.

1131
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:00,340
-升職了 -嗨
-Promoting. -Hi.

1132
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:01,940
這是切切 我的女公關
This is Cece, my P.R. Lady.

1133
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:04,510
我是西蒙斯小姐 你們能不能 考慮一下幫我們做個廣告?
Miss Simmons, would you consider doing a commercial for us?

1134
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:06,910
當然你可以負責導演 西蒙斯先生
And of course you can direct it, Mr. Simmons.

1135
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:08,610
叫我艾伯森就好 謝謝
It's Albertson. Thank you.

1136
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:10,610
-我好像弄錯了 -估計是
Well, I guess I blew that one. I guess you did.

1137
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,420
謝謝 其實我不接廣告
Thank you, but I don't really do commercials.

1138
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:14,690
一向不做
Not my thing.

1139
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:16,720
你要不要去找幾件寬鬆的衣服?
Did you want to find some large clothes?

1140
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,490
我只是說別這麼緊的
I said less tight...

1141
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:20,520
對 更放鬆一點或者寬大的衣服在這邊
Yeah, but no, the relaxed or the more looser fitting are over here.

1142
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,630
很高興認識你
Nice to meet you.

1143
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:23,530
回頭見 賽斯

See you later, guys.

1145
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,230
天啊
My God.

1146
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:29,470
-你急什麼呢 -這東西看著就不咋地
-What's the rush? -This stuff doesn't look good,

1147
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:31,640
太貴了 咱們去個好點的地方
and it's too expensive. Let's go some place nice.

1148
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,570
香奈兒或者普拉達什麼的
Like, like Chanel or Prada.

1149
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:35,370
那兒反而廉價了嗎
That's bargain basement.

1150
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:38,410
我感覺我有幽閉恐懼癥 在這裏快要沒法呼吸了
I feel like I'm claustrophobic, I can hardly breathe in here...

1151
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:40,640
-看 我愛花呢 -讓我害怕
-Look! I love tweed. -Freaking me out...

1152
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:43,480
我要試試這件
I'm going to try this on.

1153
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,780
好 來 我來幫你 我也愛花呢衣服
Okay, here, come on, I'll help you. I love tweed, too.

1154
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:47,350
阿諾德 我不需要你幫忙
Arnold, I don't need your help.

1155
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:48,920
你確定? 來讓我看看
Are you sure? Here, let me watch.

1156
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,520
等到了家也許你能看我脫掉
At home, maybe you can watch me take it off.

1157
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,860
放鬆點 牛仔
Take it easy, cowboy.

1158
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:58,000
我知道 但我可以看看你 穿上好不好看啊
I know, but I'm a good judge of you in tweed.

1159
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,560
我知道 但有時候...
I know, but sometimes it's like...

1160
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:11,680
《愛你就捧你》
Squirrels to the nuts!

1161
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,280
你沒事吧
Are you okay?

1162
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,810
真沒想到居然碰到你了 德裏克
I cannot believe I'm running into you, Derek!

1163
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,680
不 我才不安靜
No, I'm not going to be quiet.

1164
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,620
我是瑪姬 記得嗎? 芝加哥的
It's Margie, remember? From Chicago!

1165
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:22,520
我到處找你啊
I've looked everywhere for you.

1166
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,960
你不明白 你改變了我的生命
You don't understand, you've changed my life.

1167
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,930
我去了時尚學校 我現在是這兒的採購商
I went to fashion school and I'm the executive buyer here...

1168
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:29,530
-除此之外... -別說了
-Besides that... -Shut up...

1169
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:31,260
你給了我這輩子最棒的一晚
You gave me the single best night I've ever had!

1170
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:32,760
在床上床下都是
In bed and out.

1171
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,370
都是因為你和《愛你就捧你》
And it's all because of you and the Squirrels To The Nuts!

1172
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:36,870
求你小聲點
Please keep your voice down!

1173
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:38,570
好了夥計們 下次見
Okay, see you later, guys.

1174
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:39,940
天啊 賽斯·吉爾伯特
My God, Seth Gilbert!

1175
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:41,410
你們是朋友嗎 阿諾德
So, you guys friends, Arnold?

1176
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:42,910
你這說啥呢 賽斯
Where are you going with this, Seth?

1177
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:44,710
你們倆注意點形象 好嗎
Now you two behave yourselves, okay?

1178
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:46,340
還有什麼你需要的嗎?
Is there anything else you need?

1179
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,480
《愛你就捧你》 嗯?
"Squirrels To The Nuts,"

1180
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,280
你這混蛋 畜生
you weasily, no good son of a bitch!

1181
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:54,790
你別再出現在我面前
Don't you ever, ever speak to me again!

1182
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:56,550
德爾塔 不 德爾塔!
Delta, no! Delta...

1183
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,590
賽斯 等等
Seth, wait!

1184
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:10,300
我記下車牌了 肯定能找到
I got the license plate! Easy to trace.

1185
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,840
別擔心 讓我來 我都付錢
No, no, don't worry. I'll take care of it. I'll pay for everything.

1186
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,940
她是我老婆 只是趕時間
She's my wife, she was just in a hurry.

1187
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,540
對 她有個會要遲到了 而且腦子有點不正常
Yes, she's a little late for a meeting and she's a little scattered-brained.

1188
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:19,310
神經有點大條
Just absent-minded.

1189
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:21,050
布拉德 沒事 我認識他 讓他處理吧 相信我
Brad, it's okay. I know him. He's good for it. Believe me.

1190
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:22,380
好吧 好吧
Okay, okay.

1191
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,780
叫你老婆下次小心點 兄弟
Tell your wife to be more careful, Bub.

1192
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25,620
我會更小心點
I will... More careful.

1193
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,920
聽我說 德裏克 阿諾德 不管你叫什麼
Look, Derek... Arnold... Whatever your name is.

1194
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,560
我知道我太大聲了 我只是看到你太激動
I know I was speaking too loud. I was just so excited to see you.

1195
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,490
-沒事 -你要現金 支票還是傳票?
-It's okay... -Cash, check or charge?

1196
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:37,330
那女孩幹什麼的? 站街女?
So what is that girl, a hooker?

1197
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:38,760
就跟你帶去尼克飯店那個一樣?
Like the one you came to Nick's with?

1198
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,030
可能
Could be.

1199
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:41,970
應召女 三陪
Call girl. Escort.

1200
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:45,340
那有什麼區別? 反正都是 服務你內褲裏那點東西
What's the difference? They all escort you in and out of their pants.

1201
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:46,800
男人啊
Men!

1202
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,540
對 你說得對 我們只擅長一件事
Yeah, you're right. We're only good for one thing.

1203
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:52,380
那要不要來一發?
So how about some?

1204
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,780
-我在考慮 -我還記得倫敦 德爾塔
-I'm considering it! -I still remember London, Delta.

1205
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:56,750
在那之後我再也沒找到過那種感覺
I haven't felt that way since.

1206
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:58,650
得了吧 賽斯
Come on, Seth.

1207
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:01,820
你知道我們都太熟悉 現在已經找不到感覺了
You know we were both too far down other roads for us to get serious.

1208
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:04,360
你才是 我能很快就改變方向
You were. I would've switched direction in a second.

1209
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,920
我知道 你已經變了很多方向了
I know. You've switched a bunch of since then.

1210
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:08,060
-對於你就不一樣了 -拜託...
-It was different with you. -Come on...

1211
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,790
我依然準備好了 德爾
I'm still ready, del.

1212
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:12,030
到地方了 吉爾伯特先生
This is it, Mr. Gilbert.

1213
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:13,800
-這一次你要推銷什麼?  -我的新古龍水
-What are you promoting this time? -My new cologne.

1214
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,370
別告訴我叫什麼名字
Don't tell me what it's called.

1215
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:16,770
其實他們想出了一個 非常好的名字
They came up with a pretty good name, actually.

1216
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:17,940
"賽斯的誘惑"
"Seth's Seduction."

1217
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,570
很好...
Great...

1218
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:23,870
吉爾伯特先生 你來了真是太好了
Mr. Gilbert, it is so wonderful to have you here!

1219
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,810
大家都等不及想見您了
Everybody's been dying to meet you in the flesh.

1220
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:27,510
-你說什麼?  -他在戲弄你
-I beg your pardon? -He's teasing you.

1221
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:32,620
-德爾塔 跟上 跟上 -我在努力
-Delta, keep up! Keep up! -I'm trying.

1222
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,950
借過
Excuse me.

1223
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,890
能給我們簽名嗎?
Can we have your autograph?

1224
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:42,460
我們已經等了四個 小時了 只耽誤你一會兒
We waited four hours in line, it'll only take you a second.

1225
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:45,800
我會趕上你的 我在後面
I'm trying to get to you. I'm behind here.

1226
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,730
好的 女士 不能進去了
Okay, lady, the jig's up.

1227
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:53,070
你做什麼... 等等 賽斯 賽斯
What are you... Wait! Seth! Seth!

1228
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:56,410
看來她不滿意 你想要進去嗎?
Well, she ain't a pro. What, you came back for more?

1229
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:57,810
光偷衣服不夠嗎?
The suit wasn't enough?

1230
00:56:57,810 --> 00:56:59,640
不 我不是從這偷的
No, I didn't steal this from here.

1231
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,950
-那是從哪偷的?  -不 我根本沒偷東西
-Where did you steal it from? -No, I didn't steal it at all.

1232
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:04,010
我在店裏和丈夫吵了一場
I got into an argument with my husband at Barney's

1233
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,920
然後不知怎麼出去了 你應該給他們打電話
and I walked out by accident. You should call them.

1234
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,020
他的名字叫阿諾德·艾伯森 現在肯定已經付錢了
His name is Arnold Albertson, I'm sure he's paid for it by now.

1235
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,690
能請你們放我下來嗎?
Could you please put me down?

1236
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:11,190
好的 女士 我會放你 下來 你是個白癡
All right, lady, I'll put you down. You're an idiot.

1237
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:13,760
我們聽過很多說辭 但你這個是最傻的
We hear a lot of stories, but this one tops them all.

1238
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,090
"我和丈夫在店裏吵架
"I had an argument with my husband at Barney's

1239
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,600
所以我來這裏 偷另一件衣服"
so I came over to Macy's to steal another suit."

1240
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,530
不 你不明白 我根本沒偷東西
No, you don't understand. I didn't steal this at all!

1241
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:23,100
喂?
Yes. Hello?

1242
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,170
什麼? 誰?
What? Who?

1243
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:27,770
警察? 你說什麼呢?
The police? What are you talking about?

1244
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:31,640
什麼 你瘋了嗎?  是的 請讓她接電話
What, are you crazy? Yes, put her on the phone, please!

1245
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,010
阿諾德? 你最好把我弄出去
Arnold? You better get me the hell out of here

1246
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:35,580
然後送我去我父母那
and over to my parents' apartment!

1247
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,210
我最好在二十分鐘內出去
And I better get there within the next 20 minutes!

1248
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,020
你最好確定在我到那裏的時候
And you better make damn sure that you're out of the apartment

1249
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:40,820
你已經走了
before I get there!

1250
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:42,990
我建議你自己去 賓館裏開個房間
And what I suggest you do is get yourself a hotel room, buddy,

1251
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:44,720
然後再找一個應召女
and order another call girl!

1252
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,790
你真他媽的傻
Squirrels to the fucking nuts!

1253
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:02,810
獨角獸 其實是女性的一種象徵
The unicorn, you see, was a kind of symbol of women.

1254
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:05,880
這一象徵是女人被人像 動物那樣對待時候產生的
And this comes from a period when women were treated like Chattel.

1255
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,480
像牛那樣?
Like Cattle?

1256
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,910
不 是動物
No, Chattel.

1257
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:12,020
意思是她們得按照男人 的想法去生活
It basically means they were whatever men wanted them to be.

1258
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:14,250
你是說就像現在的 大多數女性一樣?
You mean, like now a lot?

1259
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:16,050
我想是的
Yeah, I guess.

1260
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:18,620
那是我寫劇本的原因之一
Part of that's why I wrote the play.

1261
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:23,530
你知道 在很古老的時候 妓女是個神聖的職業
You know, in really ancient times, the prostitute was a sacred profession.

1262
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:25,060
具體是什麼時候?
When was this?

1263
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:29,270
在精神和性慾分開之前
Well, before spirituality and sexuality were split apart.

1264
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:30,900
其實不應如此
They really shouldn't be.

1265
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:31,970
是的
Yeah.

1266
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:36,540
你是個很浪漫的人
You're a real romantic guy, aren't you?

1267
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:39,680
我想喬什在我身上 看到了些什麼
I guess Josh saw something in me.

1268
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,850
和阿諾德不一樣
And it wasn't really like Arnold.

1269
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:44,250
你知道 阿諾德和我一樣 把錢看得很重
You know, with Arnold, the money was as much for him as it was for me.

1270
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:51,290
但是喬什 我認為他是 第一個相信我的人
But with Josh, I think he was the first person who ever believed in me.

1271
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:53,860
所以自然的 一些過去 認識的人
So, of course, cue somebody from my past

1272
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,790
就會出現毀了我的好事
who's going to show up and ruin the whole damn picture.

1273
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,800
你為什麼讓我心碎?
Why are you breaking my heart?

1274
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,830
你難道不知道你傷了我的心
Don't you understand you're breaking my heart,

1275
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:03,700
伊莎...戈爾... 不管你叫什麼名字
Izzy... Glo... Whatever your name is.

1276
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,670
-法官也是有感情的 -先生
-Judges have feelings, too. -Mister!

1277
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:08,770
我不認為我們現在 適合討論這樣的話題
I don't think we're in exactly the best place to have this conversation.

1278
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:11,880
所以我建議你轉身 回到你之前的地方去
So I suggest you turn around and go right back where you came from.

1279
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,540
我建議你閉上你的嘴
And I suggest that you shut your trap!

1280
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,080
我在和這位女士說話...
I am talking to the lady...

1281
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,750
這個傷了我心的妓女
The lady of the night over here who broke my heart.

1282
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,080
我聯繫了薇琪的 援交服務 結果第二天...
I call Vickie's escort service and the next day...

1283
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,560
-喬什 你做什麼?  -爸爸?
-Josh, what are you doing? -Dad?

1284
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,720
他是個老年人
He's an old man.

1285
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,630
-是的 下流的老頭子 -你說的不對
-Yeah, a dirty old man! -That is irrelevant.

1286
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:31,230
好的 好的 有時候下流 但是不老
Okay, okay. Dirty sometimes, but not old!

1287
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:35,000
我的老天 約書亞 你知道 你惹上什麼事了嗎?
For God's sake, Joshua, do you realize what you're getting yourself into?

1288
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,700
這位女士和你的導演 共度過美好一夜
This lady had a night with your director!

1289
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,640
我得說是一個很浪漫的夜晚
A perfectly romantic one, I should say.

1290
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:43,870
伊莎貝拉 等等
Isabella! Wait!

1291
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,780
伊莎貝拉
Isabella!

1292
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:51,950
喬什知道這件事對於你來說 肯定感覺很難過
It must have been really hard for you, Josh finding out like that.

1293
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:57,220
遭遇到雙人包夾 他還有三秒鐘時間...
Double team him now, he's got three seconds to get out of...

1294
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:59,890
你去哪了 親愛的?  一直有人打電話找你
Where ya been honey? The phone's been ringing off the hook for you!

1295
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:02,130
一整天電話都響個不停
All day long! That's too many calls!

1296
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:05,230
-有約書亞...珊迪和阿爾弗雷德 -又來了
-That Joshua... Sandy and Alfred... -Again.

1297
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:06,900
是誰?
What now?

1298
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,200
一個叫德裏克的
A Derek.

1299
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:11,800
喂?
Hello?

1300
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,770
伊莎 我是阿諾德 我想馬上見你
Izzy, it's Arnold. I need to see you right away.

1301
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:16,770
你能到巴克利來嗎 還是同一個房間 1369號
Can you come over to the barclay, same room. 1369.

1302
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,740
我會解釋一切 去那見我
I'll explain everything. Just meet me here.

1303
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,210
我不知道我是否能去
I don't know if I can do that.

1304
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:23,180
你說那話是什麼意思?
What do you mean you don't know if you can do that?

1305
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:27,780
我們得排練 你就趕緊過來吧
We gotta rehearse! Just, just, just get over here.

1306
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,320
現在 比賽進入白熱化了
Now, they're all five in the ring...

1307
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:30,920

Okay.

1308
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:34,220

The barclay. 8:00 P.M. Under the usual name.

1311
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:40,700
你還記得那個姑娘嗎?

1384
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:48,410
你覺得他有多少個女人?  為什麼他要這樣?
How many women do you think he's done this with? Why does he do this?

1385
01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:51,150
到底怎麼回事?  你知道究竟怎麼回事嗎?
What is it all about? Do you have any idea what's going on?

你在說什麼呢?

我還以為你想談談 我們之間的事情
I thought you wanted to talk about us.

1389

馬桶壞了
Well, the, the, the toilet's broken.

1398
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:23,080
我得聯繫他們
I need to call them again.

1399
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,310
我不需要馬桶
I don't need to use your toilet.

1400
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,980
你不需要用馬桶
You don't need to use my toilet.

1401
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:28,650
不 我不需要用馬桶
No, I don't need to use your toilet.

1402
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:32,320
好的 既然你不需要用 馬桶的話...
Well, then I guess if you don't need to use the toilet...

1403
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,990
拜託 別再說馬桶了
Please, stop saying toilet!

1404
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:36,490
你真奇怪
You are weird.

1405
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:51,980
喂 孔蒂? 孔蒂?
Hello, Kandi? Kandi?

1406

孔蒂 你在聽嗎?  你現在沒事了 你在聽嗎?
Kandi, is that you? I put you on hold, are you there?

1407
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:08,020
德爾塔...德爾塔 親愛的 聽著 不是你想的那樣
Delta... Delta, darling, listen, it's not what you think.

1408
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:13,130
德爾塔
Delta!

1409
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:15,420
德爾塔 德爾塔

1329, it should be right next door to where you are.

1411
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,100
好的 謝謝薇琪
Okay, thanks Vickie.

1412
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:22,070
德爾塔 這是個誤會
Delta, it was a misunderstanding.

1413
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:23,410
她不應該來我房間的
She wasn't supposed to come to my room.

1414
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:25,540
拜託 賽斯 你說謊的 功夫比那好的
Come on, Seth. You can do better than that.

1415
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:28,510
既然我知道你要來 為什麼還找她 這說不通啊
Why would I have you come over with her? It doesn't make any sense!

1416
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:31,380
那姑娘要用廁所... 她嚇壞了 我不明白
The girl needed to use the bathroom... She got scared. I don't know!

1417
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:33,180
女士 是我的錯
Lady, it's my fault.

1418
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:35,420
我本來應該去1329號的
I supposed to go 1-3-2-9.

1420
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:45,000
-看見了嗎? 我說過了 -我還是不相信你
-You see? I told you. -I still don't believe you.

1421
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,230
你喜歡你的炮友 跟我丈夫一樣
You love your hookers, too. Just like my husband.

1422
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:50,100
不 這是因為我得不到你 而他能得到你
No, it's because I can't have you. He has you.

1423
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,170
沒人能得到我
Nobody has me.

1424
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:53,440

1430
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:21,400
德爾塔 親愛的 你在哪?
Delta, darling. Where, where, where are you?

1431
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:25,070
樓下 你來這裏做什麼?
Downstairs? What are you doing here?

1432
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:28,710
我還以為....不不不 是的 我很開心你來了
I thought... No, no, no. Yes, I'm happy to hear from you.

1433
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:31,240
你知道 上次我見你的時候 還在坐牢呢...
You know, the last time I spoke to you you were in jail, and...

1434

是的 直接上來
Yes, come right up.

1435
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:35,610
我的天...
My God...

1436
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:37,250
為什麼叫她直接上來?
Why'd you tell her to come up here?

1437
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:39,220
現在是紅色警戒 明白我的意思嗎?
We're in a code red, do you understand what that means?

1438
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:41,220
一陣暴風坐著電梯上來了
We have a tornado coming up the elevator

1439
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:43,150
很快就要到這裏了
and it's about to touch down here.

1440
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,120
現在你得離開這 我們得把你...
Now you've got to go. We're gonna put you...

1441
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:49,760
天啊 這裏的電梯真他媽快
Jesus, that's the fastest elevator I've ever seen!

1442

廁所
Bathroom!

1443
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,560
-我想我會吐的 -安靜點
-I think I'm gonna throw up. -Do it quietly.

1444
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,050
嗨 親愛的
Hi, honey.

1445
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:01,700
阿諾德 你這樣多久了?
Arnold, how long have you been doing this?

1446
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:03,840
-什麼?  -做你正在做的
-Doing what? -Doing what you've been doing.

1447
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:06,080
很明顯 你不止做過一次
Obviously, you've done it more than once.

1448
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,440
所謂的"松鼠與堅果"
This whole "Squirrels To The Nuts" thing

1449
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:10,380
很明顯是你自己的算盤
is obviously your own special little bit.

1450
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:12,420
我還以為這只是 我們的事情 阿諾德
I thought it was just ours, Arnold.

1451
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:15,720
你說這樣做是為了 幫助我度過職業生涯的艱難時期
Something you said to help me get through a difficult time in my career.

1452
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:18,250
顯然你把這個當做 是你的掩護
Evidently you've been using it as some kind of seduction,

1453
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:22,160
當做是一個誘餌 來引一些人上鉤
a kind of lure, a kind of a general serenade for whoever wants to listen.

1454
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,130
德爾塔 親愛的 這個可要比 那個複雜一些
Delta, darling, it's more complicated...

1455
01:08:24,130 --> 01:08:26,360
那就看著我的眼睛 告訴我到底怎麼回事?
Than meets the eye, yes, I'm sure. Well please, tell me. What is it?

1456
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,230
為了你的新作品做研究?
Research for some wonderful new play you're planning?

1457
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:29,700
也許是新的電影?
Some new film, perhaps?

1458
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:32,640
某方面來說是的 我想做一個女性故事
Well, in a way, yes. I'm touched by women's stories.

1459
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,140
顯然是
Apparently!

1460
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:36,540
不 這是... 我是主張男女平等的
No, it's... I'm sort of a feminist...

1461
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:38,240
是的 當然
Yeah, sure.

1462
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:41,240
那樣說也許不對 但是在精神上意識到
That's not the right word, but kind of a mental aware...

1463
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:45,320
你身上的香水味 真奇怪 阿諾德
Odd perfume you're wearing, Arnold.

1464
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,320
最近來了一點 "松鼠與堅果"?
Had a little "Squirrels To The Nuts" up here lately?

1465
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,890
你說什麼呢? 不 我...
What are you talking about? No! I...

1466
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:56,690
我不相信
I don't believe this.

1467
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:00,430
一晚上來兩次?
Twice in a night?

1468
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:02,830
德爾塔 德爾塔 德爾塔 不要開門
Delta. Delta. Delta, don't open the door.

1469
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:08,770
德爾塔 不是你想的那樣
Delta, it's not what you think it is.

1470
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:11,810
他說的對 你知道 真的不是你想的那樣
He's right, you know. It... It's really not.

1471
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:14,240
好的 知道嗎?  這一個還更蹩腳
Okay, you know what? This is the Topper!

1472
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:17,150
現在該我走了
And now comes my exit.

1473
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:19,820
離開這裏
Out of the room,

1474
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:21,480
離開旅館
out of the hotel,

1475
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:23,290
告別這戲劇
out of this play,

1476
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:27,220
告別我的生活
out of my life!

1477
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,430
祝你們兩好運
Good luck to you both!

1478
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:33,560
德爾塔 停下 等等
Delta, stop! Wait!

1479
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:34,830
德爾塔 德爾塔
Delta! Delta!

1480
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:36,670
我不想再聽任何話
I don't wanna hear anything more! Ever!

1481
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:38,740
不是看起來的那樣
It's not what it looks like!

1482
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:41,700
說實話這不是我第一次 看見伊莎
Well, it's not exactly first time I've seen Izzy leave Arnold's room,

1483
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:43,940
-離開阿諾德的房間 -真有趣
-to be honest, sorry. -How interesting.

1484
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:47,340
看起來所有人都知道怎麼回事
It seems that everybody in the entire world knew what was going on

1485
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,550
除了我
except for me.

1486
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:50,310
-我真傻 我真傻 -你不傻
-Stupid, stupid me. -You're not stupid.

1487
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:52,680
真高興看到你們這群人 在危機時刻團結在一起
So glad you boys stick together in a time of crisis.

1488
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:54,880
賽斯 你在這裏做什麼?  你總是這樣
Seth, what are you even doing here? You're always lurking.

1489
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:57,390
你還是跟著你的圍巾 和小狗流浪去吧
Just loitering there, with your scarves and your little dog.

1490
01:09:57,390 --> 01:09:58,920
不要管這件事
Just stay out of it!

1491
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,790
你才是瘋子 放著 這麼好的妻子不管
You're the lunatic, chasing dames with a wife like this.

1492
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:02,530
看起來男人們都 是喜歡美女的 賽斯
It seems all men like chasing dames, Seth.

1493
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:05,400
不 西蒙斯太太 他只是試著幫忙
No, miss Simmons, he was just trying to help.

1494
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,930
你知道 他改變了我的生活 他給了我三萬美金
You know, he changed my life. He gave me $30,000

1495
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:11,200
今天我有了我的 第一間公寓
and today I got my first apartment.

1496
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,900
-他做了什麼?  -三萬美金?
-He what? -Thirty thousand dollars? U.S.?

1497
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:16,240
-是的 -我再也受不了了
-Yeah. -I can't handle any more!

1498
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:17,910
一晚上三萬美金?  你的功夫肯定挺好
For one night? You must be good.

1499
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:20,410
不不不 你不明白
No, no, no, you don't understand...

1500
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:21,510
我只是試著...
I was trying...

1501
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:22,850
你高興了?
You happy?

1502
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:25,450
你怎麼能這樣武斷
Where do you get the right to be so judgmental!

1503
01:10:25,450 --> 01:10:28,520
聽著 夥計 你不會想和我 打的 我能揍扁你
Listen, mate! You don't want to fight me, I'll kick the shit out of you!

1504
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,390
-我是受過倫敦街頭訓練的 -是嗎?
-Trained on the streets of London! -Really?

1505
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:32,660
你說的倫敦是七年前 勾引我妻子的倫敦嗎?
Is that the same London where you seduced my wife, seven years ago?

1506
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:34,890
根本不是那麼回事 她愛的是你
Nothing of the sort at all. She loved you!

1507
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:36,460
我都不知道為什麼
Not that I can see why or how!

1508
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:38,930
為什麼? 也許是因為 我是好人 而且我喜歡...
Why? Maybe because I'm a good guy and I like...

1509
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:40,760
-喜歡妓女 -是的 沒錯
-Who likes hookers! -Yeah. Checkmate!

1510
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:43,300
因為我不完美 知道嗎?  但你也一樣
Because I'm not perfect, okay? Neither are you!

1511
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:45,540
天啊 這是浪費時間 這是浪費時間
Jesus Christ, this is a waste of time. It's a waste of time!

1512
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:46,840
我要去睡覺了 好嗎?
I'm going to go to sleep now, okay?

1513
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,810
困了 困了
Tired! Tired!

1514
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:50,740
我只能說在早上
All I can say is that in the morning

1515
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:54,340
和你一起合作還是很愉快的
it's going to be a distinct pleasure working with you, Arnold.

1516
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:57,580
-是的 你的房間在這邊 -我知道
-Yeah. Your room's over here! -I knew that!

1517
01:10:57,580 --> 01:11:00,280
有些時候的夜晚當你回到家
There were those nights when you get home

1518
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:01,920
沒人好聯繫
and there's no one to call.

1519
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,420
沒有剩下的酒可以喝
And there's no vodka left to drink.

1520
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:08,590
除了一些商業廣告外 也沒什麼好看的節目
And you got nothing on TV apart from those stupid infomercials.

1521
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:13,000
你就一個人呆著
And you're stuck with yourself.

1522
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,470
那就是人們所說的恐怖的意思
And that's what they mean when they say the word terror.

1523
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:19,040
因為我只想沉浸在 某個人的懷抱裏
Because all I wanted was to be wrapped up in somebody's arms.

1524
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,940
任何人的懷抱裏
Anybody's arms.

1525
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:23,810
即使是陌生人也行
Even a stranger's.

1526
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:28,750
我討厭孤獨
I hate... I hate being alone.

1527
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:31,910
但是當我孤獨的時候 我會看著鏡子
But when I am, I look into the mirror

1528
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,550
然後跟我自己說 奧黛麗·赫本說過的話
and I tell myself something that Audrey Hepburn once said...

1529
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:40,760
"我相信粉紅色
"I believe in pink.

1530
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:44,690
我相信微笑是最好 的減肥方式
"I believe that laughter is the best calorie burner.

1531
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:48,060
我相信吻
"I believe in kissing.

1532
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:50,070
經常吻
"Kissing a lot.

1533
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:53,500
我相信堅強
"I believe in being strong

1534
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:57,770
即使周圍的一切看來不對
"even when everything around you seems to be going wrong.

1535
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:03,380
我相信快樂的女孩 是最美的
"I believe that happy girls are the prettiest girls.

1536
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:07,350
我相信明天是新的一天
"And I believe that tomorrow is another day.

1537
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:11,390
我相信奇跡"
And I believe in miracles!"

1538
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,690
我相信奇跡
I believe in miracles.

1539
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:19,400
你知道 那是...
You know, that...

1540
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:23,700
那辦法每次都有用
That works every single time.

1541
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:31,110
嘿 伊莎貝拉 謝天謝地
Hey, Isabella. Thank God.

1542
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:33,780
我昨晚一直打你的電話 但是你沒接
I was trying to call you all night last night, you didn't pick up your phone.

1543
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:35,410
我真的不知道該做什麼
I didn't really know what to do.

1544
01:12:35,410 --> 01:12:37,480
你知道 我想我只是來這裏
You know, I figured I'd just show up.

1545
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,420
-早上好 喬什 伊莎 -嘿
-Morning Josh. Izzy. -Hey.

1546
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:41,480
-睡得怎麼樣 親愛的?  -不好
-How did you sleep, darling? -Not good.

1547
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:43,450
不要讓它影響你
Don't let it get ya down!

1548
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:45,920
好的 我們開始吧 今天不能浪費時間
Okay, let's start right in. We don't want to waste any time today.

1549
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,090
人都到齊了嗎?
Is everybody here?

1550
01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:48,960
是的 除了德爾塔都到了
Yeah, everybody but Delta.

1551
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,530
那就不是到齊了
Well, then, everybody's not here!

1552
01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:52,060
你說除了德爾塔都 到齊了是什麼意思?
What do you mean, "Yeah, everybody but Delta?"

1553
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:54,760
你應該說"除了德爾塔都來了"
You mean, "Everybody but Delta", you leave out the "Yeah."

1554
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:56,500
除了德爾塔都來了 先生
Everybody's here but Delta, sir.

1555
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,100
好的 別叫我先生 珊迪
Okay, don't call me sir, Sandy.

1556
01:12:58,100 --> 01:12:59,770
好的 我們就先開始吧
All right, we're going to start without her.

1557
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:01,600
我們先坐下讀劇本吧
Let's just sit down and have a table-read.

1558
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:03,370
大家早上好
Good morning, everybody!

1559
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:04,770
我想我們先讀劇本吧
I assume we're starting with a reading.

1560
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:06,260
是的 我正要說這個
Yes, that's what I was just saying.

1561
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:07,740
-我想也許我們可以坐下來... -好的
-I thought maybe we'd just sit down... -Fine!

1562
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,610
我們開始之前先 講些事情
Let me just say something here before we get started.

1563
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:38,710
聽著 我們都是專業人員
Look, we're all professionals here.

1564
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:41,640
但那並不意味著我們的 私生活就沒問題
Which isn't to say that we don't have problems in our private lives

1565
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:43,750
當然偶爾會有問題
from time to time. Of course we do.

1566
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:47,850
但是我們之所以專業 就是因為我們不會讓這些問題
But what makes us professionals is that we don't let those problems

1567
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:49,890
干涉我們的工作
slop over into our work.

1568
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:55,530
我們不在工作的時候 談論那些問題
And we can't talk about them in any way, shape or form.

1569
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:57,660
把它加入到你的表演中 成為催化劑
Use it for your performance, let it fuel that,

1570
01:13:57,660 --> 01:14:01,960
但是可不能被它們分心了
But don't let it distract you from our purpose here.

1571
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:05,170
當然這樣的一套陳詞濫調
Which is, of course, that old show business cliche,

1572
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:07,100
是我深信不疑的
which I happen to really believe in.

1573
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:09,510
表演必須繼續
The show must go on and it will!

1574
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:10,940
-我們要讓公眾看到 -好的
-We owe it to the public. -Fine!

1575
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:12,210
我很同意你的看法
I agree with you absolutely,

1576
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:14,040
但是我沒有看劇本
but I'd just as soon not read the play.

1577
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:16,050
我想從第一幕第一場開始
I would like to begin with act 1 scene 1,

1578
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:17,980
就是賽斯和我的對手戲 我想馬上開演
between Seth's character and mine. I'd like to get it up right away.

1579
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:19,980
-等等 你說什麼?  -你聽到了
-Wait, I beg your pardon? -On its feet.

1580
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:22,820
好的...
Okay...

1581
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:24,890
是的 我想我們應該 先把劇本全看一遍
Yeah, well, I think that we should read the entire play first...

1582
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:26,490
考慮到現在的情況
Well, considering the situation,

1583
01:14:26,490 --> 01:14:28,460
當然我們不想談
which of course we're not going to speak about,

1584
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:30,790
我想我們應該幫助 演員們適應它們
I think we ought to just help the actors get through this,

1585
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,030
就像進入到一個 漫長黑暗隧道的盡頭
like getting to the end of a long, dark tunnel,

1586
01:14:33,030 --> 01:14:36,130
而不是去盲目的遵循 一些已於的規則
rather than try to follow some accepted directorial rules.

1587
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:38,570
我認為你是一個 非常有創新的導演
I'd like to think you're bigger than that as a director.

1588
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:43,040
有人有問題嗎? 賽斯? 伊莎?
Anybody have a problem with this? Seth? Izzy?

1589
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,140
-有問題嗎?  -沒有
-Anybody? -Nope.

1590
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:45,780
-不 我沒有 -很好
-No, not me. -Great!

1591
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:52,750
好的 我們從第一場開始 只需要賽斯和德爾塔
Okay we'll start with scene 1. Only Seth and Delta are needed.

1592
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:55,920
其他人可以看劇本
The rest of us can watch from the orchestra.

1593
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:59,860
在臥室裏安排一張 沙發和兩把椅子行嗎?
Would you bring out the bedroom with the couch and the two chairs?

1594
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:04,790
好的 幕布升起來
All right, the curtain rises.

1595
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,630
在哈爾·芬尼根旅館的房間裏
It's hal finnegan's hotel suite.

1596
01:15:07,630 --> 01:15:09,270
德爾塔 準備好了就說...
Delta, whenever you're ready...

1597
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:12,740
第一句話不是我說的 如果是我就開始了
Well, I don't have the first line. But if I did I would begin.

1598
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:15,040
好的
All right.

1599
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,870
"既然你不想理解 我說的話 我能說什麼呢?
"Well, you refuse to understand what I'm saying, so what can I say?

1600
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,110
我想我很抱歉"
I'm sorry, I guess."

1601
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:22,750
"沒事的 我習慣了
"That's okay, I'm used to it.

1602
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:25,680
你在不知道自己在說 什麼時總是大喊大叫"
You always yell when you don't know what you're talking about."

1603
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,920
"我知道我在說什麼 只是你不想聽
"I know what I'm talking about, you don't want to hear it.

1604
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,950
這事情真是娘氣"
It's a real female thing."

1605
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:32,190
"當你不想聽的時候 你就不去聽"
"When you don't want to hear something, you just don't hear it."

1606
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:33,960
"我真的很難理解你是
"Well, it's very hard for me to understand

1607
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:36,730
如何做到和別的女人 睡覺之後再和我睡的
"how you can sleep with other women and then sleep with me

1608
01:15:36,730 --> 01:15:38,230
然後告訴我沒有任何關係"
and tell me it doesn't mean anything."

1609
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:40,060
-這是真的 -所以你說
-"Well, it's true." -"So you're saying

1610
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:42,930
"你和別的女人共度的時間
"that the time you spend with other women

1611
01:15:42,930 --> 01:15:45,970
都只是逢場作戲
"doesn't exist any more in your brain.

1612
01:15:45,970 --> 01:15:48,140
那不應該是很美好的回憶嗎? "
It isn't some sort of pleasant memory?"

1613
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:49,970
不 我沒那麼說
"No, I didn't say that."

1614
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:52,310
-那好吧 -什麼?
-"Well, then..." -"Well, then what?"

1615
01:15:52,310 --> 01:15:54,740
"當你和我做愛的時候
"How can I not think about what you're thinking about

1616
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:57,080
我怎麼才能不去想 你在想的事情? "
"when you're making love to me?

1617
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:59,650
"我怎麼知道你當時 想的是我
"How do I know you're with me and not with some other woman

1618
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:01,920
而不是別的女人呢? "
"you made love to some other time?

1619
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,990
所以我們不同步
"Therefore we're not in sync?

1620
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:06,990
因為也許我也在想 別的男人 對吧?
Because I might be thinking about some guy, too, right?"

1621
01:16:06,990 --> 01:16:08,890
我不知道我們怎麼會這樣
"I don't know how we got here.

1622
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:11,230
我只是說了句"我們為何不去 素食餐廳
"All I said was, 'why don't we go to a vegetarian restaurant.'

1623
01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:12,800
然後這吵鬧就爆發了
"And this had to happen."

1624
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:15,330
把它給我
"Give me that."

1625
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:17,170
-不 你戒了 -你也是
-"No, you quit." -"So did you."

1626
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:19,100
我破了戒並不意味著 我就得...
"Well, just because I'm breaking my thing, doesn't mean I..."

1627
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:20,940
幹嘛 我連抽口煙都不行?
"What... I can't have a puff on your cigarette?"

1628
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:22,940
-我沒那麼說 -那你就給我啊
-"I didn't say that." -"Well, then, give it to me."

1629
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:24,640
不 現在抽煙讓我覺得不好
"No, I feel bad now for smoking.

1630
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,640
因為這讓我覺得 我慫恿你破戒了
'Cause it's like I'm breaking your thing..."

1631
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,350
我有自己的獨立思想 我現在就想抽支煙
"I have an independent mind. I want a fucking puff on the cigarette! Now!"

1632
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:31,650
-好的 給你 -謝謝你
-"Okay, here." -"Thank you."

1633
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:40,360
叮鈴鈴...
Ring-Ring! Ring-Ring!

1634
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:41,990
幹嘛不接電話?
"Why don't you answer it?

1635
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:43,230
也許是你朋友打來的
"It's probably one of your friends.

1636
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:45,860
反正我朋友從來不打電話
"None of my friends can ever get through."

1637
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:50,600
你自己去接 我現在 不想和任何人說話
"Answer it yourself. I've no interest in talking to anybody right now."

1638
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,640
我有點餓了
"I'm getting kinda hungry...

1639
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:53,940
你想做什麼?
"What do you want to do?"

1640
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:55,940
我要你過來吻我
"I want you to come over here and kiss me."

1641
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:04,780
有詳細的要求嗎?
"Any particular way?"

1642
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:06,950
蒙住眼睛 我雙腿交叉
"Blindfolded with my legs crossed."

1643
01:17:06,950 --> 01:17:09,120
不如我蒙住眼睛 親你的腿如何?
"How about blindfolded with your legs apart?"

1644
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,920
這台詞我覺得不太好 喬什 你覺得呢?
I'm not sure about that line, Josh. What do you think?

1645
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,990
讀劇本就好 賽斯
Just read the fucking script, Seth.

1646
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:15,290
好的 好的 好的
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1647
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:17,030
之後再回答你的傻問題
We'll get to your dumb actor questions later.

1648
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:19,130
按照劇本讀 賽斯
Just read it, Seth.

1649
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:21,900
不如蒙住眼睛 你雙腿分開?
"How about blindfolded with your legs apart?"

1650
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,370
閉上嘴吻我
"Just shut up and kiss me."

1651
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:28,370
他 他傾下身子 給她一個深吻
"He, he, he leans in and gives her a long kiss."

1652
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,140
好的...
Okay...

1653
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:07,280
好的 好的 我明白了
All right, okay. I got it!

1654

What is this, caligula? I'm suppose to sit here and watch this?

1656

黑爾
Heel.

1661
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:31,470
你在這做什麼? 珍妮在哪?

1664
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:42,240
我來告訴你怎麼回事
I'll tell you what's going on here.

1665
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:46,420
你僱傭那個妓女 因為她很有技巧
You hired that hooker because she turns good tricks.

我能讓你們都滿足
I've got tricks on all of you!

1669
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:55,220
珍妮 你這樣很沒禮貌 非常不專業
Jane, this is very inappropriate and unprofessional!

1670
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:57,890
我才不管你想什麼
I don't give a shit what you think!

1671
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,260
你以為你是誰 海明威嗎?

珍妮·克萊蒙特小姐
Miss Jane Claremont,

1674
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:04,930

1675
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:06,490
你是誰?
And you are?

1676
01:19:06,490 --> 01:19:08,040
爸爸 你穿著那衣服做什麼?
Dad! What are you doing in that outfit?

1677
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,970
-我的天啊 -那是你父親?
-My goodness. -That's your father?

1678
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:14,180
那個經常找你的人是個拉比?
The man who calls you constantly... Is a rabbi?

1679
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:16,850
拜託 我們現在在綵排
Come on, we're in the middle of a God damn rehearsal!

1680
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:18,880
-是的 -根據我的觀察
-Yeah. -Well, from what I've just observed,

1681
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:21,920

I think you might be in the middle of losing your wife!

1682
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,390
這個人是誰?
Who is this person?

1683
01:19:23,390 --> 01:19:25,120
她是誰 阿諾德?
Who is she, Arnold?

1684
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,520
我不知道
I have no idea!

1685
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:29,230
她是我的前女友 阿諾德
She's my ex-girlfriend, Arnold.

1686
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:32,060
我是瞭解這一切的人
I am the person that knows what's going on here

1687
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:34,030
而且我受夠了
and I'm fed up with it.

1688
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:37,500
這個女人被雇來和這裏 的很多人上了床
This woman has been hired to sleep with a number of people in this room.

1689
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:40,000
我已經知道了兩個 現在也許有三個了吧?
Two that I know of, by now probably three?

1690
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:42,100
真的嗎?
Really?

1691
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:44,040
那麼我就應該把
Then I'm going to beat the shit out of anybody

1692
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,810
和我女兒睡了覺的人 打出屎來

01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:51,380
-他...和他 -那是謊話
-Him... And him. -That's a lie!

1696
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:55,250
子彈可以殺人 但是拳頭 可以把事情鬧大
A bullet can kill, but a punch can change things for the living.

1697
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:56,480
我給你舉個例子
I'll give you spoilers.

1698
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,490
約翰·韋恩和倫道夫·斯科特
John Wayne and Randolph Scott tore

1699
01:19:58,490 --> 01:20:01,420
為了馬琳·黛德麗在酒吧 大打出手
apart a bar fighting for Marlene Dietrich.

1700
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:05,560
當然約翰·韋恩贏了 然後他們幸福的生活著
John Wayne won, of course, and they lived happily ever after.

1701
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:08,550
我們從沒做
We never did it.

1702
01:20:09,530 --> 01:20:12,370
住手 阿爾 住手 你以為你在做什麼?
Stop it, Al, just stop it! What the hell do you think you're doing?

1703
01:20:12,370 --> 01:20:13,970
這只是一場戲劇
This is all just a play!

1704
01:20:13,970 --> 01:20:16,070
這個又是誰?
And who... Who is this?

1705
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:18,570
我父親打破了僵局
My father tore a hole in the sky.

1706
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:20,140
大家都鬆了一口氣
Everyone felt a release.

1707
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:22,580
慢點 先生
Slow down, sir.

1708
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:25,410
你不能就這樣進來然後 把一切都毀了
You can't just come in here and ruin everything I'm doing, dad.

1709
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:26,880
怎麼回事?
What is going on?

1710
01:20:39,230 --> 01:20:40,560
不要靠近我
Don't come towards me!

1711
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:42,430
別過來 不然我會吹哨子
Don't come, I'll blow this whistle again!

1712
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:49,310
如果你不放開過去 未來就會受到影響
If you don't let go of your past, it'll strangle your future.

1713
01:21:07,090 --> 01:21:08,360
這是...給我一點
What is... Give me those!

1714
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,560
那些不是玩具
Those are not playthings.

1715
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:10,890
不 是橡膠做的
No, they're rubbers.

1716
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:13,360
說橡膠不太好 親愛的
It's not nice to say rubbers, darling.

1717
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,160
-不 他們是避孕套 -不 是橡膠
-No, they're condoms. -No, they're rubbers.

1718
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:17,030
很高興擔任了這個角色
Wonderful plays your father directs...

1719
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:18,300
不 它們就是避孕套
No, they're condoms.

1720
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:43,060
我要離開我的生活
I'm going to live my life!

1721
01:21:43,630 --> 01:21:44,990
再見了
So long!

1722
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,350
什麼? 什麼?
What? What?

1723
01:22:08,350 --> 01:22:10,920
那是我們的孩子
There's our baby!

1724
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,530
-我們的孩子 -嘿 她是我的
-Our baby! -Hey! She's mine.

1725
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:21,330
精彩 精彩
Bravo! Bravo!

1726
01:22:27,370 --> 01:22:28,970
精彩
Bravo!

1727
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:34,110
精彩
Bravo!

1728
01:22:36,010 --> 01:22:38,110
評論怎麼樣 好嗎?
So the plays' reviews were that good?

1729
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,650
好像演了一周
I thought it closed in a week?

1730
01:22:39,650 --> 01:22:41,150
是的...
Yeah...

1731
01:22:41,150 --> 01:22:43,220
我是說 問題是 長島的妻子們
I mean, the problem is, Long Island house wives,

1732
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:46,620
她們可不願意去看 一群應召女演話劇
they don't want to spend their big night out in the company of call girls.

1733
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:48,960
她們想看跳舞的獅子
They want dancing lions.

1734
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,460
她們想看唱歌
They want singing mormons, you know.

1735
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:54,330
她們去影院是為了逃避
They go to the theater to escape.

1736
01:22:54,330 --> 01:22:56,030
很諷刺 對吧?
It's ironic, isn't it?

1737
01:22:57,540 --> 01:23:01,300
但是還有些魔法在等著我
But there was still a sprinkle of magic waiting for me.

1738
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:04,240
觀眾席中在我媽媽 身後坐著一個人
There was this guy in the audience, sat behind my mother,

1739
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:07,110
他擁有一家電影工作室
and he owned a movie studio.

1740
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:09,210
剩下的就是歷史了
And the rest is history.

1741
01:23:09,210 --> 01:23:12,380
是的 我很幸運
Yeah, well, I was really lucky.

1742
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:14,280
就是那個導致了你和 喬什的分開嗎?
Is that what caused you and Josh to split up?

1743
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:16,740
你成功了?
Your success?

1744
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:19,190
你知道 我只是覺得生活中
Well, you know, I just feel like some things in life

1745
01:23:19,190 --> 01:23:20,620
有些事情是無法永遠持續的
aren't meant to last forever.

1746
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:22,460
嘿 賽斯
Hey, Seth!

1747
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:24,190
-嘿 薇琪 -抱歉來遲了
-Hey, Vickie. -Sorry we're late.

1748
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,760
-沒關係 -她是誰?
-That's okay. -Who's that?

1749
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,300
她為什麼在這兒?  那些女人是誰?
Why is she here? Who are all those women?

1750
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:30,570
你邀請了她們嗎?  她們是應召女?
Did you invite them? Is this an activist group?

1751
01:23:30,570 --> 01:23:33,370
可以那麼說
You could say that.

1752
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:35,240
-天啊 不 趴下 -什麼?
-Dear God, no! Get down! -What?

1753
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,310
-我的腳很疼 -我的天
-My feet are killing me. -My God...

1754
01:23:37,310 --> 01:23:39,240
-松鼠和堅果 -不不不
-Squirrels to the nuts! -No, no, no...

1755
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:40,640
他就是我經常說起的傢伙
That's the guy I always talked to you about!

1756
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:42,750
-我還以為事情結束了 -是啊
-I thought that was the end. -It is!

1757
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:46,180
你不知道.... 你不知道你改變了我的生活
You have no idea... You have no idea! You changed my life!

1758
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:49,150
我找了所有叫邁克爾·哈里森的人
I looked for every Michael Harrington in the world, practically.

1759
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:53,260
我用那些錢發展了 鎮上最好的三陪服務
I took that money and parlayed it into the best escort service in town, honey.

1760
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:55,020
你覺得她們如何?
How do you like them apples?

1761
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:56,190
見到你真好
Great to see you!

1762
01:23:56,190 --> 01:23:57,530
再見 回見
Bye, I'll catch you later.

1763
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,160
結束了
That's the end.

1764
01:24:01,130 --> 01:24:02,460
阿諾德怎麼樣了?
And Arnold?

1765
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:04,330
我沒見到他
Well, I haven't seen him.

1766
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:08,100
最近聽說他在為 非營利性組織工作
Last I heard he was working for some sort of non-profit organization

1767
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:11,440
為女性慈善機構 捐贈了不少錢
making very large, anonymous donations to women's charities.

1768
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:14,210
然後德爾塔看上了新的人
And then Delta, she fell for a new guy.

1769
01:24:14,210 --> 01:24:17,680
一個火箭專家 她想上月球
Some sort of rocket scientist. You know, she's over the moon about that.

1770
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:22,650
而我的醫生...我想依然 和賽斯·吉爾伯特在一起
And then my therapist... I think she's still with Seth Gilbert.

1771
01:24:22,650 --> 01:24:25,790
你知道 紅色蜜蜂
You know, the red bees. So...

1772
01:24:25,790 --> 01:24:28,620
發展的非常好
Yeah, it all wrapped up real nice.

1773
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:31,290
就像是一部電影
You know, sort of just like a movie.

1774
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:34,430
那你呢? 你找到另一半了嗎?
What about you? Is there a person in your life?

1775
01:24:34,430 --> 01:24:38,830
我找到了一個良師益友
Well, let's just say I got a mentor...

1776
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:42,240
其實就是因為他 我才告訴你這些
He's actually a lot of the reason why I'm telling you all this.

1777
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:44,140
他是一個很會講道理的人
He's very into saying it how it is.

1778
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:47,440
他說這個鎮子的人 喜歡有過去的演員
He says that this town loves an actress with a past

1779
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:49,450
他說的很對
and he's sure right about that.

1780
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:51,710
聽起來你找到了自己的位置
Well, it sounds like you've found your place.

1781
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:54,320
不管是什麼 你都很開心
Wherever you are, that's your happy place.

1782
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,690
就像松鼠和堅果
Squirrels to the nuts, and all of that.

1783
01:24:56,690 --> 01:24:58,290
你現在會引用了?
You're quoting cluny brown now?

1784
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,620
什麼?
What?

1785
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:03,860
那句台詞是克魯尼·布朗說的
That "Squirrels To The Nuts" line, it's from Lubitsch's Cluny Brown.

1786
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:06,200
-嘿 親愛的 -嘿
-Hey, darling. -Hey.

1787
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:08,360
是查爾斯·博野 對詹妮弗·瓊斯說過的
It's what Charles Boyer says to Jennifer Jones

1788
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:10,170
在他們相愛之前
just before they fall in love.

1789
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:12,730
你是在告訴我這句話 甚至不是原創嗎?
You mean to tell me after all that, it's not even original?

1790
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:14,570
什麼原創?
What's original?

1791
01:25:14,570 --> 01:25:16,570
親愛的 如果我們還想 去看演唱會的話
Honey, if we're going to get to the Sonny Chiba triple feature

1792
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:18,540
現在就得走了
we need to leave right now.

1793
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:20,280
他是個功夫明星
He's a kung-fu actor.

1794
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:22,110
他是這個地球上 唯一比我還愛電影的人
He's the only guy on the planet who loves movies more than I do.

1795
01:25:22,110 --> 01:25:24,750
是的 但是你知道很多
Yep. True! But you know a lot.

1796
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:36,790
真有趣
That's very interesting,

1797
01:25:36,790 --> 01:25:38,730
你看起來很壓抑
you don't seem to be inhibited.

1798
01:25:38,730 --> 01:25:40,530
試著特別一些
Try to be more specific,

1799
01:25:40,530 --> 01:25:43,200
是什麼讓你覺得不合適?
what made you think that you were out of place?

1800
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:44,570
我沒這麼想
I didn't think I was.

1801
01:25:44,570 --> 01:25:46,640
是阿爾叔叔 他總是告訴我
It's Uncle Arn. He's always telling me,

1802
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:49,270
"克魯尼·布朗 你不知道你的位置"
"Cluny Brown, you don't know your place."

1803
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:51,470
沒人能決定你的位置
Nobody can tell you where your place is.

1804
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,310
我的位置是什麼?  大家的位置是什麼?
Where is my place? Where is anybody's place?

1805
01:25:53,310 --> 01:25:54,710
我告訴你是什麼
I'll tell you where it is.

1806
01:25:54,710 --> 01:25:57,280
你開心的地方就是你的位置
Wherever you're happy, that's your place.

1807
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:00,650
開心是讓人適應環境
And happiness is a matter of purely personal adjustment

1808
01:26:00,650 --> 01:26:02,180
最好的方式
to your environment.

1809
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:03,620
比如說在海德公園
In Hyde Park, for instance.

1810
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:06,590
有些人喜歡給松鼠喂堅果
Some people like to feed nuts to the squirrels.

1811
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:08,860
但是如果你覺得給 堅果喂松鼠很有趣
But if it makes you happy to feed Squirrels To The Nuts,

1812
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:11,190
那就可以去做 沒什麼不對的
who am I to say nuts to the squirrels?

1813
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,640
你做了什麼 笨蛋?
What did you do? Schmuck!

1814
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,230
謝謝你 埃利奧特
Thank you, Elliot.

1815
01:26:55,230 --> 01:26:56,930
你要考慮的就是
All you could come up with

1816
01:26:56,930 --> 01:26:59,170
所謂職業道德的軟肋
was this weak borscht about professional ethics

1817
01:26:59,170 --> 01:27:02,770
因為你擔心人們是否 能處理好這些冠冕堂皇
because you are worried about how this thug will handle rejection.
