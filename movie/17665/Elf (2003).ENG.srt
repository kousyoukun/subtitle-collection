2
00:00:29,027 --> 00:00:29,593
Oh, hello.

3
00:00:29,628 --> 00:00:31,530
You're, uh, you're probably here

4
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:33,649
About the, Uh, the story.

5
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:35,699
Elves love to tell stories.

6
00:00:35,734 --> 00:00:38,537
I- I'll bet you didn't know that
about elves.

7
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,856
There's, uh, probably a lot of things

8
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:43,105
You... you didn't know about elves.

9
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,810
Another... another interesting
Uh, elf ism

10
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:53,250
Uh, there are only three jobs available
to an elf.

11
00:00:53,285 --> 00:00:54,902
The first is making shoes at night

12
00:00:54,937 --> 00:00:56,520
While, you know, while the old...

13
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:58,154
The old cobbler sleeps.

14
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:01,225
Lazy bum. Couldn't even make a clog.

15
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,860
You can bake cookies

16
00:01:02,895 --> 00:01:03,659
In a tree. Hey!

17
00:01:03,694 --> 00:01:06,796
As you can imagine, it's, uh, dangerous
Having an oven

18
00:01:06,831 --> 00:01:09,265
In an oak tree during the dry season.

19
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,999
I wanna make shoes!

20
00:01:11,034 --> 00:01:13,570
But the third job... uh, some call
It, uh,

21
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:15,804
"The show," or... or "the big dance,"

22
00:01:15,839 --> 00:01:19,959
It's the profession that every elf
Aspires to,

23
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:24,080
And that is to build toys in
Santa's workshop.

24
00:01:24,115 --> 00:01:26,310
Only two weeks left till Christmas!

25
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,818
I- It's a job only an elf can do.

26
00:01:29,853 --> 00:01:31,237
Our... our nimble fingers,

27
00:01:31,272 --> 00:01:33,014
Natural cheer and active minds

28
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:34,722
Are perfect for toy-building.

29
00:01:34,757 --> 00:01:37,726
They... they tried using gnomes
And trolls,

30
00:01:37,761 --> 00:01:40,593
But the gnomes drank too much...

31
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:44,929
...and the trolls weren't toilet
trained.

32
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:50,572
No human being has ever set... set
foot in Santa's workshop.

33
00:01:50,607 --> 00:01:53,375
Uh, that is until about 30 years ago,

34
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,360
And, as you may have guessed,

35
00:01:56,395 --> 00:01:59,312
That's where our story begins.

36
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:32,878
Wow!

37
00:02:35,649 --> 00:02:37,207
Whoa!

38
00:03:13,685 --> 00:03:15,253
Ooh!

39
00:03:15,288 --> 00:03:16,850
Wow!

40
00:03:16,885 --> 00:03:18,413
Wow!

41
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:29,496
Ow! Ow!

42
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,879
Whoa!

43
00:03:47,784 --> 00:03:49,979
Are you sleepy?

44
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:51,753
Here we are.

45
00:03:51,788 --> 00:03:56,359
We're just going to make you feel
so comfortable.

46
00:03:56,394 --> 00:03:58,428
Here we are.

47
00:03:58,463 --> 00:04:00,428
There you are.

48
00:04:00,463 --> 00:04:03,664
It's time to go to sleep.

49
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:07,226
Maybe by next Christmas you'll
Have a home.

50
00:04:13,543 --> 00:04:17,502
Merry Christmas, my ángel.

51
00:04:44,072 --> 00:04:46,904
Mmm...

52
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:28,279
All right, all right.

53
00:05:28,314 --> 00:05:31,818
We've had another very successful
year.

54
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:36,204
So, after all that hard work,

55
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:38,790
It's time to start preparations

56
00:05:38,825 --> 00:05:40,425
For next Christmas!

57
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:53,965
What in the name of Sam hill
Is that?

58
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,807
Wow...

59
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:02,842
A baby...

60
00:06:05,483 --> 00:06:07,817
"little buddy diapers."

61
00:06:07,852 --> 00:06:09,952
His name is buddy. He must've...

62
00:06:09,987 --> 00:06:12,356
Snuck into your sack at the
orphanage.

63
00:06:12,391 --> 00:06:12,822
What do we do?

64
00:06:12,857 --> 00:06:15,992
So, Santa had a
Decision to make,

65
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:18,129
And fortunately, when it
Comes to babies,

66
00:06:18,164 --> 00:06:19,428
Santa's a... a pushover.

67
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,665
So, buddy stayed with, uh
An older elf

68
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,597
Who had always wanted a child?

69
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,168
But had been so committed to
Building toys, he...

70
00:06:25,203 --> 00:06:30,006
He, well, had forgotten to
Settle down.

71
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:30,605
Santa.

72
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,877
Yes, yes, I... I raised buddy.

73
00:06:33,912 --> 00:06:36,111
I was his adopted father.

74
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,846
Though buddy grew twice as fast,

75
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:42,085
He... he wasn't any different from
the other children.

76
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,755
Chuckles not too fast, buddy.

77
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,354
I mean, not... not really.

78
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:49,274
Before we learn how to build
The latest

79
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,602
In extreme graphic chipset
Processors,

80
00:06:51,637 --> 00:06:53,896
Let's recite the
"Code of the elves,"

81
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:54,764
Shall we?

82
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:55,562
Number one.

83
00:06:55,597 --> 00:06:58,567
"Treat every day like Christmas."

84
00:06:58,602 --> 00:06:59,333
Number two.

85
00:06:59,368 --> 00:07:03,372
"There's room for everyone on the
Nice list."

86
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:04,471
Number three.

87
00:07:04,506 --> 00:07:07,876
"The best way to spread Christmas
Cheer

88
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:11,709
Is singing loud for all to hear."

89
00:07:11,946 --> 00:07:14,582
And one day, when buddy was
old enough,

90
00:07:14,617 --> 00:07:16,785
I made him my own personal
apprentice.

91
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,871
I've never been in this room
before.

92
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,922
Well, I think it's time you start

93
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:22,890
Your tinker training.

94
00:07:23,558 --> 00:07:26,926
Santa's sleigh.

95
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:29,589
You're gonna help me make it fly.

96
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,701
I thought the magical reindeer made
The sleighs fly.

97
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:36,503
And where do the reindeer get
their magic from?

98
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:41,007
Christmas spirit. Everybody
knows that.

99
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:43,093
Well, silly as it sounds,

100
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:45,104
A lot of people down south

101
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:47,080
Don't believe in Santa Claus.

102
00:07:47,115 --> 00:07:48,880
What?!

103
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:52,119
Well, who do they think puts all?
their toys under the tree?

104
00:07:52,154 --> 00:07:54,055
Well, there's a rumor floating around

105
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,956
That, uh, that the parents do it.

106
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:57,889
That's... that's ridiculous.

107
00:07:57,924 --> 00:08:00,926
I mean, parents couldn't do that
all in one night.

108
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:02,026
What about Santa's cookies?

109
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:04,497
I suppose parents eat them, too?

110
00:08:04,532 --> 00:08:05,563
Yeah, I, uh, I... I know,

111
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,067
Uh, and every earless and less
People

112
00:08:08,102 --> 00:08:08,733
Believe in Santa Claus.

113
00:08:08,768 --> 00:08:12,204
I mean, we have a real energy
crisis on our hands.

114
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:12,670
Oh.

115
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:16,642
I mean, just see how low the, uh
Claus meter is.

116
00:08:16,677 --> 00:08:18,444
That's shocking.

117
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,177
That's why I came up

118
00:08:20,212 --> 00:08:22,615
With this little beauty in the '60s.

119
00:08:27,218 --> 00:08:28,451
WH-what is it?

120
00:08:28,486 --> 00:08:29,953
It's a cringle 3000...

121
00:08:29,988 --> 00:08:33,658
A 500-reindeer power jet turbine
engine.

122
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:35,158
Without it, the sleigh couldn't

123
00:08:35,193 --> 00:08:39,129
Get more than, uh, a few feet off
the ground.

124
00:08:40,999 --> 00:08:42,550
Well, it looks like we got

125
00:08:42,585 --> 00:08:44,594
A short in the thermo coupler.

126
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:46,604
You wanna give mea hand with that?

127
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,070
You want me to help?

128
00:08:48,105 --> 00:08:50,474
As much as, uh, buddy was accepted

129
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:52,643
By his family and friends,

130
00:08:52,678 --> 00:08:54,743
There were a few drawbacks

131
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:58,549
To being, uh, a human in, uh
an elf's world.

132
00:09:19,635 --> 00:09:21,737
Hey, Ming Ming.

133
00:09:21,772 --> 00:09:22,703
Um...

134
00:09:22,738 --> 00:09:27,109
I'm gonna be a little bit short
on today's quota.

135
00:09:27,144 --> 00:09:28,142
It's all right, buddy.

136
00:09:28,177 --> 00:09:29,712
Just how many etch-a-sketches

137
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:32,983
Did you get finished?

138
00:09:33,018 --> 00:09:36,218
Come on, buddy. How many?

139
00:09:36,253 --> 00:09:40,518
I made, uh... 85.

140
00:09:46,027 --> 00:09:48,086
Eighty-five?

141
00:09:48,763 --> 00:09:50,628
That puts you...

142
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,566
915 off the pace.

143
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:54,134
Ooh... that's bad.

144
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:55,535
Why don't you just say it?

145
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,089
I'm the worst toy maker in
the world.

146
00:09:58,124 --> 00:10:00,608
I'm a cotton-headed ninny-muggins.

147
00:10:01,175 --> 00:10:04,044
No, buddy, you're not cotton-
headed ninny-muggins.

148
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,147
We all just have different talents
That's all.

149
00:10:07,182 --> 00:10:08,047
Seems like everyone else

150
00:10:08,082 --> 00:10:09,515
Have the same talents
except for me.

151
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,353
You... you have, you have lots of
Talents, uh...

152
00:10:12,388 --> 00:10:15,890
Special talents in fact, like
Um, uh...

153
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:16,655
Special talents?

154
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,393
You changed the batteries in the
smoke detector.

155
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:20,159
You sure did... aaa's.

156
00:10:20,194 --> 00:10:23,397
And in six months, you'll have
to check 'em again...

157
00:10:23,432 --> 00:10:24,129
Won't he?

158
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:26,866
And you're the only baritone in
the elf choir.

159
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:29,102
You bring us down whole octave.

160
00:10:29,137 --> 00:10:30,437
In a good way.

161
00:10:30,472 --> 00:10:31,703
See, buddy?

162
00:10:31,738 --> 00:10:33,907
You're not a cotton-headed ninny-
muggings.

163
00:10:33,942 --> 00:10:37,741
You're just... special.

164
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:43,716
And so, buddy was sent where the...
The special elves work.

165
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:45,877
Aah!

166
00:10:57,262 --> 00:10:59,765
Ah!

167
00:11:21,185 --> 00:11:21,684
Hey, foom foom...

168
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:24,004
I hate to do this to you, but you
Think you could

169
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:26,290
Help me pick up the slack on those
etch-a-sketches?

170
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:28,426
No problem. I appreciate it.

171
00:11:28,461 --> 00:11:29,091
Buddy is killing me.

172
00:11:29,126 --> 00:11:32,730
I already got lum lum and choochoo pulling' doubles.

173
00:11:32,765 --> 00:11:34,282
That was quick thinking yesterday

174
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:35,725
With that ¡°special talents¡± thing.

175
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,048
I feel bad for the guy.

176
00:11:37,082 --> 00:11:38,300
I just hope he doesn't get wise.

177
00:11:38,335 --> 00:11:41,938
Well, if he hasn't figured out
He's a human by now,

178
00:11:41,973 --> 00:11:44,304
I don't think he ever will.

179
00:11:47,944 --> 00:11:50,625
If he hasn't figured
Out he's a human

180
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,306
By now, I don't think he ever will.

181
00:11:54,317 --> 00:11:57,218
I think they're too small.

182
00:11:58,855 --> 00:12:03,154
You're just... special.

183
00:12:20,743 --> 00:12:22,945
You don't look so good, buddy.

184
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,444
Are you okay?

185
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:26,981
I'll be okay, I just need a glass
of water.

186
00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:29,176
Aah!

187
00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:32,208
Buddy...

188
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:35,482
Unh! Aah!

189
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:54,741
Buddy, are you okay?

190
00:12:54,776 --> 00:12:56,742
I'm sorry, papa.

191
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,177
I just need some alone time.

192
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,782
Buddy, I... I think we... we have
to talk.

193
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:04,936
Buddy, uh, I think there's something

194
00:13:04,971 --> 00:13:08,020
I... I probably should tell you.

195
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:11,525
You probably should have found
out a long...

196
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,691
A long time ago.

197
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:15,761
I then proceeded to tell buddy of
how his father

198
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,698
Had fallen in love when he was
very young

199
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:21,600
With a beautiful girl named
Susan wells,

200
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:22,733
And how buddy was born

201
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,271
And put up for adoption by
his mother,

202
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:28,240
And how she had later passed away.

203
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:29,240
I... I told him his father

204
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,777
Had never even known that
Buddy was born,

205
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:32,543
And most importantly,

206
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,478
I told him where his father was...

207
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:38,583
Uh, in a magical land called
new York City.

208
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,950
My dad works there?

209
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:43,282
Empire state building.

210
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:49,894
Hey, buddy, wanna pick some
snow berries?

211
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,761
Not now, arctic puffin.

212
00:13:53,998 --> 00:13:56,500
Hello, buddy. Oh... hi, Leon.

213
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,421
Why the long face, partner?

214
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:01,715
It seems I'm... I'm not an elf.

215
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,363
'Course you're not. You're 6'3"

216
00:14:04,398 --> 00:14:06,977
And had a beard since you were 15.

217
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,077
Papa says my real father

218
00:14:08,112 --> 00:14:11,281
Lives in a magical place far away.

219
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:12,349
I don't know what to do.

220
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,348
At least you have a daddy.

221
00:14:13,383 --> 00:14:17,588
I was just rolled up one day and
left out here in the cold.

222
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,290
But the thing is, I've never even left
the North Pole.

223
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:22,676
Buddy, I've been around the world
Many times

224
00:14:22,711 --> 00:14:24,993
When I was a young cumulus
nimbus cloud.

225
00:14:25,028 --> 00:14:28,898
It's a wonderful place, filled with
Wondrous creatures...

226
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:29,397
Except dogs.

227
00:14:29,432 --> 00:14:32,301
Oh, by the way, don't eat the
yellow snow.

228
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:32,900
Oh, I know that.

229
00:14:32,935 --> 00:14:37,006
All I'm say in' is, this might be
The golden opportunity

230
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,804
To find out whom you really are.

231
00:14:42,678 --> 00:14:44,946
So, I hear you're going

232
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:47,917
On a little journey to
the big city.

233
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:49,083
Yup. Ahh.

234
00:14:49,118 --> 00:14:50,353
I'm kind a nervous.

235
00:14:50,987 --> 00:14:52,954
Leon says New York is pretty
different.

236
00:14:52,989 --> 00:14:53,987
Oh, don't pay attention to Leon.

237
00:14:54,022 --> 00:14:57,993
He's never been anywhere.
He doesn't have any feet.

238
00:14:58,028 --> 00:15:00,629
I've been to New York thousands
of times.

239
00:15:00,664 --> 00:15:01,647
Really? Mm-hmm.

240
00:15:01,682 --> 00:15:02,596
What's it like?

241
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:05,467
Well, there are some things you
should know.

242
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:08,070
First off, you see gum on
The street,

243
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:10,639
Leave it there. It's not
free candy.

244
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:11,838
Oh. Second,

245
00:15:11,873 --> 00:15:14,425
There are, like, 30 ray's
pizzas.

246
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,977
They all claim to be the
Original,

247
00:15:17,012 --> 00:15:18,611
But the real one' son 11th.

248
00:15:18,646 --> 00:15:21,248
And if you see a sign that
Says "peep show,"

249
00:15:21,283 --> 00:15:23,851
That doesn't mean that
They're letting you

250
00:15:23,886 --> 00:15:27,121
Look at presents before Christmas.

251
00:15:27,156 --> 00:15:27,920
Can't wait to see my dad...

252
00:15:27,955 --> 00:15:31,425
We're gonna go ices skating and...
And eat sugar plums.

253
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,745
Yeah, that's the other thing

254
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,840
I wanted to talk to you about.

255
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,455
You know, buddy...

256
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,000
Your father...

257
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:45,438
Well... he's on the naughty list.

258
00:15:45,473 --> 00:15:48,930
No!

259
00:15:49,876 --> 00:15:54,047
You're taking the books back?

260
00:15:55,048 --> 00:15:57,383
See, I... I see what you're trying
to do here.

261
00:15:57,418 --> 00:15:59,236
Y- You're trying to make me feel bad,

262
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:01,054
When, in actuality, you're the one

263
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:02,086
That missed the payments.

264
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:06,058
But the children love the books.

265
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:06,890
I know that, uh...

266
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:09,194
You know, I'm the one that ran
The focus groups,

267
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:10,661
But I like hearing that.

268
00:16:10,696 --> 00:16:14,066
Listen, some people, they just
Lose sight

269
00:16:14,101 --> 00:16:15,866
Of what's important in life.

270
00:16:15,901 --> 00:16:21,707
That doesn't mean they can't find
their way again, huh?

271
00:16:21,742 --> 00:16:22,539
Maybe all they need

272
00:16:22,574 --> 00:16:25,210
Is just a little Christmas spirit.

273
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,715
Well, uh, I... I'm good at that.

274
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,206
I know you are.

275
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:46,929
And I'll...

276
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:47,663
I'll always, uh,

277
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:50,724
I'll always be here for you.

278
00:16:57,173 --> 00:16:59,604
Now, uh...

279
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,035
Go... uh, get.

280
00:17:12,989 --> 00:17:13,722
Bye, guys.

281
00:17:13,757 --> 00:17:17,027
Bye, buddy. Bye, buddy. Take care.

282
00:17:17,062 --> 00:17:19,017
Bye-bye.

283
00:17:20,663 --> 00:17:22,263
Bye-bye.

284
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:23,532
Bye-bye, buddy.

285
00:17:25,634 --> 00:17:27,226
There, there.

286
00:17:29,505 --> 00:17:31,404
Huh?

287
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:33,304
Oh! Ohh!

288
00:17:36,045 --> 00:17:39,214
Bye, buddy. Hope you find your dad.

289
00:17:39,249 --> 00:17:41,205
Thanks, Mr. Narwhal.

290
00:17:42,016 --> 00:17:43,483
Bye.

291
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:36,569
Hey! What's your name?

292
00:18:36,604 --> 00:18:39,299
My name's buddy.

293
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,838
Ohh!

294
00:18:46,345 --> 00:18:48,347
Does someone need a hug?

295
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:55,086
aah, aah! That's not cool!

296
00:18:56,187 --> 00:18:58,280
I just wanted a hug!

297
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:40,828
Hi.

298
00:19:40,863 --> 00:19:42,394
Hello.

299
00:19:48,838 --> 00:19:50,734
Thank you.

300
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:52,631
Thank you.

301
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:02,116
You did it! Congratulations!

302
00:20:02,151 --> 00:20:07,123
"World's best cup of coffee.
"Great job, everybody.

303
00:20:07,158 --> 00:20:09,858
It's great to meet you.

304
00:20:09,893 --> 00:20:11,416
Hi.

305
00:20:22,737 --> 00:20:25,440
Santa, san... uh, nope.

306
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,159
Not Santa.

307
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:28,781
Thank you.

308
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:30,368
Thank you.

309
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,726
Thank you. Hey, you know what?
No.

310
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:21,158
No, all right? Thank you.

311
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:23,718
Get outta here, get outta here.

312
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:00,676
Hello. Hi.

313
00:22:00,711 --> 00:22:02,824
Ooh...

314
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:08,770
Beautiful.

315
00:22:18,982 --> 00:22:21,542
Looks like a Christmas tree.

316
00:22:22,852 --> 00:22:24,886
A reprint?

317
00:22:24,921 --> 00:22:26,790
You know how much that's gonna
cost?

318
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:27,956
Two whole pages are missing.

319
00:22:27,991 --> 00:22:29,224
The story doesn't make any sense.

320
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:31,511
What, you think some kid's gonna
notice two pages?

321
00:22:31,546 --> 00:22:33,762
I mean, they... all they do is look
at pictures.

322
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:38,083
Sorry I can't ride with you the
Rest of the way up,

323
00:22:38,118 --> 00:22:40,769
But this is where my dad works.
Well, have a good...

324
00:22:40,804 --> 00:22:42,002
Oh, I forgot to give you a hug!

325
00:22:42,037 --> 00:22:43,973
Oh, I don't know, Connie,
I've never

326
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:45,441
Declared kittens before.

327
00:22:45,476 --> 00:22:46,407
How many?

328
00:22:46,442 --> 00:22:47,942
Eight?

329
00:22:47,977 --> 00:22:49,877
Uh, I don't know if I'm gonna
Have time.

330
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:52,364
Oh, all right, just bring 'em by
The camper this week,

331
00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:54,817
And I'll see what I can do. I'm
Not gonna charge you.

332
00:22:54,852 --> 00:22:57,318
Just bring 'em by, and I'll see
What I can do.

333
00:22:57,353 --> 00:22:59,052
I have to go. Excuse me.

334
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:02,457
I'm here to see a Walter hobs.

335
00:23:02,492 --> 00:23:03,923
I'm buddy the elf. Laughs

336
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:07,528
You look hilarious! Who sent you?

337
00:23:07,563 --> 00:23:09,495
Papa elf. Papa elf?

338
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,248
Mm-hmm. From the North Pole.

339
00:23:11,283 --> 00:23:12,932
From the North Pole? Yes.

340
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:15,686
So, you really think we should
Ship 'em?

341
00:23:15,721 --> 00:23:18,048
No, I think we should take a
$30,000 bath

342
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:20,375
So some kid can understand
What happened?

343
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,042
To a puppy and a frigging pigeon

344
00:23:22,077 --> 00:23:23,961
ship 'em.

345
00:23:23,996 --> 00:23:25,811
Yeah.

346
00:23:25,846 --> 00:23:28,582
Mr. Hobbs? It's me on the intercom.

347
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:28,981
Go ahead.

348
00:23:29,016 --> 00:23:32,611
Yeah, I think some one sent you a
Christmas-gram.

349
00:23:33,854 --> 00:23:35,321
Dad!

350
00:23:38,392 --> 00:23:41,211
All right, uh, let's get it
Over with.

351
00:23:41,246 --> 00:23:43,996
I walked all day and night to
Find you.

352
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:46,966
Uh, you look like you came from
the North Pole.

353
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,635
That's exactly where I came from.

354
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,321
Santa must've called you!

355
00:23:51,356 --> 00:23:52,937
Oh, yeah, sure, he, uh...

356
00:23:52,972 --> 00:23:54,874
Just got off the cell phone
with me.

357
00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:56,140
You did?!

358
00:23:56,175 --> 00:23:58,609
So, go on. Go on with what?

359
00:23:58,644 --> 00:24:00,880
Well, are... are you gonna sing a
Song or something,

360
00:24:00,915 --> 00:24:02,648
Or can I just go back to work?

361
00:24:02,683 --> 00:24:05,516
A song? Uh...

362
00:24:05,551 --> 00:24:10,955
Yeah. Anything for you, dad, uh...

363
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:16,361
I... I'm, I'm here with my dad

364
00:24:16,396 --> 00:24:17,127
And we never met

365
00:24:17,162 --> 00:24:20,999
And he wants me to sing
Him a song

366
00:24:21,034 --> 00:24:22,499
And, um, I was adopted

367
00:24:22,534 --> 00:24:24,868
But you didn't know I was born

368
00:24:24,903 --> 00:24:29,374
So, I'm here now, I found you,
Daddy

369
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:31,676
And, guess what? I love you

370
00:24:31,711 --> 00:24:35,475
I love you I love you!

371
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,681
Wow, that was weird.

372
00:24:38,716 --> 00:24:41,552
You know, usually you guys just
Uh, you know,

373
00:24:41,587 --> 00:24:44,388
Put my name into jingle bells or
something.

374
00:24:44,423 --> 00:24:45,154
It's me, your son.

375
00:24:45,189 --> 00:24:48,425
Susan wells had me, and... And she
Didn't tell you,

376
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,928
And, and, and, but now I'm here...

377
00:24:50,963 --> 00:24:52,180
It's me buddy.

378
00:24:52,215 --> 00:24:53,362
Susan wells.

379
00:24:53,397 --> 00:24:56,696
Uh, you said Susan wells? Yes.

380
00:24:57,101 --> 00:24:58,966
Who sent this Christmas-gram?

381
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:01,137
What's a Christmas-gram?
I want one.

382
00:25:06,008 --> 00:25:08,460
It's okay, Walter's my father.

383
00:25:08,495 --> 00:25:10,913
Well, your dad's busy right now.

384
00:25:10,948 --> 00:25:12,146
Okay, I'll come back later.

385
00:25:12,181 --> 00:25:13,649
Yeah, you know, you're not gonna

386
00:25:13,684 --> 00:25:14,716
Come back for awhile, okay?

387
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:16,719
You're gonna go back to
Santa land.

388
00:25:16,754 --> 00:25:17,185
Okay.

389
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,485
Yeah, why don't you go back?
to gimbals'?

390
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,234
Sorry! Sorry.

391
00:25:53,521 --> 00:25:55,885
Passion fruit spray?

392
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,249
Fruit spray? Sure.

393
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:16,635
Sorry.

394
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:20,776
Sorry.

395
00:26:25,285 --> 00:26:27,082
Do you wanna go?

396
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,036
Hey! Have you seen these?
toilets?

397
00:26:44,071 --> 00:26:46,732
They're gl-normous!

398
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:50,608
"For that special someone."

399
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,213
Past!

400
00:26:55,248 --> 00:26:56,580
Grunts

401
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,184
Hey, come... come here!

402
00:26:59,219 --> 00:27:02,084
Me? Yes.

403
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:06,789
What are you doing down here?

404
00:27:06,824 --> 00:27:09,594
You're not supposed to be
Down here!

405
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:10,793
You can shop on your break,

406
00:27:10,828 --> 00:27:12,662
You don't... come on, get upstairs!

407
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:15,533
Okay, I didn't know. Well
You should know!

408
00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:16,532
Are you mad at me? No.

409
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:18,169
Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure.

410
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:19,521
Just do your job.

411
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:20,838
Okay, fair enough.

412
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:23,105
wow!

413
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,240
What's this?

414
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:25,975
This is the North Pole.

415
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,594
No, it's not. Yes, it is.

416
00:27:27,629 --> 00:27:29,171
No, it's not. Yes, it is.

417
00:27:29,206 --> 00:27:30,744
No, it isn't. Yes, it is.

418
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,247
No, it isn't. Yes, it is.

419
00:27:32,282 --> 00:27:35,217
No, it's not. Where's the snow?

420
00:27:35,785 --> 00:27:36,718
Why you smiling like that?

421
00:27:36,753 --> 00:27:39,254
I just like to smile, smiling's
my favorite.

422
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:42,058
Make work your favorite, that's
You're favorite, okay?

423
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,894
Okay. Work is your new favorite.

424
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:44,526
Fine.

425
00:27:44,561 --> 00:27:46,329
It's time for the announcement.

426
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:46,761
Okay.

427
00:27:46,796 --> 00:27:49,865
Okay, people, tomorrow
morning 10 a.m.,

428
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,367
Santa's coming' to town!

429
00:27:51,402 --> 00:27:52,833
Santa!

430
00:27:52,868 --> 00:27:54,301
Oh, my god!

431
00:27:54,336 --> 00:27:58,741
Santa here?! I know him.

432
00:27:58,776 --> 00:27:59,573
I know him.

433
00:27:59,608 --> 00:28:01,076
He'll be hereto take pictures

434
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:02,578
With all the children.

435
00:28:02,613 --> 00:28:03,043
Yeah!

436
00:28:03,078 --> 00:28:05,714
Just keep your receipts.
10 a.m. Tomorrow.

437
00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:06,680
10 a.m. Tomorrow.

438
00:28:06,715 --> 00:28:07,815
Santa's coming to town.

439
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,885
Yes. Can you sign this for me?

440
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,621
Ohh! Hi.

441
00:28:34,275 --> 00:28:35,408
Are you enjoying the view?

442
00:28:35,443 --> 00:28:38,712
You are very good at decorating
that tree.

443
00:28:38,747 --> 00:28:40,731
Why are you messing with me?

444
00:28:40,766 --> 00:28:42,716
Did krumpet put you up to this?

445
00:28:42,751 --> 00:28:44,116
I'm not messing with you.

446
00:28:44,151 --> 00:28:46,136
It's just nice to meet
Another human

447
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:48,664
Who shares my affinity for?
elf culture.

448
00:28:48,699 --> 00:28:51,158
I'm just trying to get
through the holidays.

449
00:28:51,193 --> 00:28:51,590
Get through?

450
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:55,162
Christmas is the greatest
Day in the whole wide world!

451
00:28:55,197 --> 00:28:56,681
Please stop talking to me.

452
00:28:56,716 --> 00:28:58,130
Uh-oh. Sounds like someone

453
00:28:58,165 --> 00:29:00,334
Needs to sing a Christmas
Carol.

454
00:29:00,369 --> 00:29:00,866
Go away.

455
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:02,668
The best way to
Spread Christmas cheer

456
00:29:02,703 --> 00:29:04,337
Is singing loud for all to hear.

457
00:29:04,372 --> 00:29:05,436
Thanks, but I don't sing.

458
00:29:05,471 --> 00:29:07,940
Oh, it's easy, it's just like
Talking...

459
00:29:07,975 --> 00:29:08,873
Except louder and longer

460
00:29:08,908 --> 00:29:10,107
And you move your voice up
And down.

461
00:29:10,142 --> 00:29:12,878
I can sing, but I just choose not
to sing.

462
00:29:12,913 --> 00:29:15,064
Especially in front of other
people.

463
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:17,181
Well, if you sing alone,
You can sing

464
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:18,851
In front of other people. There's
no difference.

465
00:29:18,886 --> 00:29:21,420
Actually, there's a big difference.

466
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:23,356
No, there... no, there isn't.

467
00:29:23,391 --> 00:29:24,846
Wait.

468
00:29:25,825 --> 00:29:26,623
I'm singing

469
00:29:26,658 --> 00:29:30,011
I'm in a store, and I'm singing

470
00:29:30,046 --> 00:29:33,330
I'm in a store, and I'm singing

471
00:29:33,365 --> 00:29:36,801
Hey! There's no singing in the
North Pole.

472
00:29:36,836 --> 00:29:38,136
Yes, there is.

473
00:29:38,171 --> 00:29:39,402
No, there's not.

474
00:29:39,437 --> 00:29:41,840
We sing all the time.
No, there's not.

475
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:44,476
Especially when we make toys.

476
00:29:44,511 --> 00:29:45,175
See?

477
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:47,512
Attention,
all gimbel's shoppers,

478
00:29:47,547 --> 00:29:49,998
Please make your final purchases.

479
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:52,859
We'll be closing in ten minutes.

480
00:29:52,894 --> 00:29:55,651
Well, it's time for me to go home.

481
00:29:55,686 --> 00:29:59,356
But... but Santa's coming,
There's so much to do.

482
00:29:59,391 --> 00:30:02,658
Yeah, um... laughs

483
00:30:02,693 --> 00:30:05,229
I'll see you tomorrow...

484
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:08,432
Buddy. Jovie.

485
00:30:08,467 --> 00:30:10,525
Hi. Hi.

486
00:30:13,203 --> 00:30:14,471
Jovie.

487
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,759
Hey, uh... I'm gonna eat in the
bedroom, okay?

488
00:31:11,794 --> 00:31:12,858
I, uh, I got

489
00:31:12,893 --> 00:31:14,560
A bunch of stuff to go over.

490
00:31:14,595 --> 00:31:16,931
Are you sure? I'm... I'm just way
Behind

491
00:31:16,966 --> 00:31:18,766
On a bunch of stuff.

492
00:31:18,801 --> 00:31:20,097
Okay.

493
00:31:23,604 --> 00:31:25,272
Can I eat in my room?

494
00:31:25,307 --> 00:31:26,772
No. Why not?

495
00:31:26,807 --> 00:31:27,839
Dad's eating in his room.

496
00:31:27,874 --> 00:31:30,243
I got a bunch
Of homework to go over,

497
00:31:30,278 --> 00:31:32,612
And I'm way behind on a bunch
of stuff.

498
00:31:32,647 --> 00:31:35,103
You're eating here.

499
00:32:08,614 --> 00:32:11,850
I really can't stay

500
00:32:11,885 --> 00:32:15,454
I've got to go 'way

501
00:32:15,489 --> 00:32:19,023
This evening has been

502
00:32:19,058 --> 00:32:22,492
So very nice

503
00:32:22,527 --> 00:32:26,529
My mother will start to worry

504
00:32:26,564 --> 00:32:31,135
And father will be pacing'
The floor

505
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:35,404
So, really, I'd better scurry

506
00:32:35,439 --> 00:32:40,308
Well, may be just a half a drink
More

507
00:32:40,343 --> 00:32:44,881
The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there

508
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:47,401
Say, what's in this drink?

509
00:32:47,436 --> 00:32:49,851
No cabs to be had out there

510
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:55,123
I wish I knew how to break the
Spell

511
00:32:55,158 --> 00:32:59,362
I'll take your hat, your hair
Looks swell

512
00:32:59,397 --> 00:33:01,865
I ought to say no, no, no, sir

513
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,865
Mind if I move in closer?

514
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,285
At least I'm gonna say that
I tried

515
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,671
What's the sense of hurting?
my pride?

516
00:33:08,706 --> 00:33:11,505
I really can't stay

517
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:18,914
Ah, but it's cold outside baby,
it's cold outside!

518
00:33:24,887 --> 00:33:27,423
Get out! Don't look at me!

519
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:28,889
Get out!

520
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,439
Just hear those sleigh bells
Jingling

521
00:33:44,474 --> 00:33:47,907
Ring-ting-tingling, too

522
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,210
Come on, it's lovely weather

523
00:33:50,245 --> 00:33:54,248
For a sleigh ride together
With you

524
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:56,617
Outside the snow is falling

525
00:33:56,652 --> 00:33:58,952
And friends are calling yoo-hoo

526
00:33:58,987 --> 00:33:59,851
Dad?

527
00:33:59,886 --> 00:34:02,054
Come on, its lovely weather dad.

528
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:05,492
Dad, hi! It's me! For a sleigh
Ride together with you

529
00:34:05,527 --> 00:34:07,326
Buddy. Dad! Dad! Dad!

530
00:34:07,361 --> 00:34:10,847
Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap

531
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:14,299
Let's go, let's look at the show

532
00:34:14,334 --> 00:34:19,272
We're riding in a wonderland
Of snow

533
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,271
Hey! It's okay,

534
00:34:20,306 --> 00:34:21,941
I just have a gift for my dad.

535
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:22,807
Okay, I'll take this.

536
00:34:22,842 --> 00:34:24,443
Okay. Well, just make sure he knows

537
00:34:24,478 --> 00:34:25,879
It's from me buddy, his son, okay?

538
00:34:25,914 --> 00:34:27,245
Okay. And that I love him so much,

539
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,815
And that I think he's the greatest
dad in the world.

540
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,082
You guys are so strong.

541
00:34:31,117 --> 00:34:33,551
Wow! My cheeks are nice
And rosy

542
00:34:33,586 --> 00:34:36,889
This is neat. And comfy
Cozy are we

543
00:34:36,924 --> 00:34:40,057
We're snuggled up together

544
00:34:40,092 --> 00:34:44,062
Like two birds of a feather
Would be

545
00:34:44,097 --> 00:34:46,965
Let's take that road before us

546
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,818
And sing a chorus or two

547
00:34:49,853 --> 00:34:52,602
Come on, it's lovely weather

548
00:34:52,637 --> 00:34:57,574
For a sleigh ride together
With you

549
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,049
Hey, you. Me?

550
00:35:07,084 --> 00:35:10,918
Come here. I wanna talk to you.

551
00:35:12,323 --> 00:35:14,124
What do you wanna talk to?
Me about?

552
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:14,790
How come you were

553
00:35:14,825 --> 00:35:17,394
In the women's locker room these
morning?

554
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:18,093
I heard you singing.

555
00:35:18,128 --> 00:35:20,531
You sure it had nothing to
Do with the fact

556
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:22,200
That I was naked in the shower?

557
00:35:22,235 --> 00:35:24,419
I didn't know you were naked.

558
00:35:24,454 --> 00:35:26,046
Why were you here so early?

559
00:35:26,081 --> 00:35:27,603
They shut my water off.

560
00:35:27,638 --> 00:35:30,506
What were you doing here so
early?

561
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:32,838
Building this.

562
00:35:34,077 --> 00:35:36,110
You built this? Mm-hmm.

563
00:35:36,145 --> 00:35:38,848
They're kind a pissed about
this.

564
00:35:38,883 --> 00:35:40,145
Really?

565
00:35:40,883 --> 00:35:42,350
Hey, guys.

566
00:35:42,385 --> 00:35:43,384
Have you seen the place?
Mm-hmm.

567
00:35:43,419 --> 00:35:45,521
It's pretty good. It's a
little too good.

568
00:35:45,556 --> 00:35:47,588
Corporate must have sent in a
professional.

569
00:35:47,623 --> 00:35:50,493
I don't know why some body's
Gunning' for my job,

570
00:35:50,528 --> 00:35:54,130
But, look... let's
Remain team, okay?

571
00:35:54,165 --> 00:35:56,115
'Cause if I go, we all go.

572
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,031
If you get wind of anything,

573
00:35:58,066 --> 00:36:00,634
Call me on my radio,
Channel three.

574
00:36:00,669 --> 00:36:03,705
Code word is "Santa's got
A brand new bag,"

575
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,036
Okay?

576
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,560
Six-inch ribbon curis, honey.

577
00:36:08,595 --> 00:36:11,580
That's impossible. Six... inches.

578
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,918
By the way... I think you have

579
00:36:16,953 --> 00:36:18,687
The most beautiful singing voice

580
00:36:18,722 --> 00:36:20,677
In the whole wide world.

581
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:29,895
Santa...

582
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:32,433
Hey, hey! Ho ho ho!

583
00:36:33,701 --> 00:36:35,034
Yeah!

584
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:37,937
Santa, it's me buddy!

585
00:36:37,972 --> 00:36:40,975
It's me! Hey, buddy,
How you doing?

586
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:41,941
It's me!

587
00:36:41,976 --> 00:36:43,610
Are you ready to see Santa?

588
00:36:43,645 --> 00:36:45,009
Who the heck are you?

589
00:36:45,044 --> 00:36:47,580
What are you talking about?
I'm Santa Claus.

590
00:36:47,615 --> 00:36:48,413
No, you're not.

591
00:36:48,448 --> 00:36:51,618
Uh, WH-why, of course I am!

592
00:36:51,653 --> 00:36:52,584
Ho ho ho ho ho!

593
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:54,452
Well, if you're Santa...

594
00:36:54,487 --> 00:36:57,657
What song did I sing for you on?
Your birthday this year?

595
00:36:57,692 --> 00:37:01,261
Uh, happy birthday of course!

596
00:37:01,296 --> 00:37:02,394
Ho ho ho ho ho!

597
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:05,465
Uh, so, how old are you, son?

598
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:05,997
Four.

599
00:37:06,032 --> 00:37:07,399
You're a big boy, what's
your name?

600
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:10,002
Paul. And, uh, what can I
get you for Christmas?

601
00:37:10,037 --> 00:37:11,236
Paul... don't tell him what
You want.

602
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,637
He's a liar. Let the kid talk.

603
00:37:13,672 --> 00:37:16,942
You disgust me. How can you live?
With yourself?

604
00:37:16,977 --> 00:37:19,111
Just cool it, zippy. Woman:
Smile.

605
00:37:19,146 --> 00:37:20,911
You sit on a throne of lies.

606
00:37:20,946 --> 00:37:23,115
Look, I'm not kidding'.
You're a fake.

607
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,081
I'm a fake? Yes.

608
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:26,452
How'd you like to be dead, huh?

609
00:37:26,487 --> 00:37:29,455
Fake. No, he's kidding.

610
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:29,953
You stink.

611
00:37:29,988 --> 00:37:32,323
I think you're gonna have a good
Christmas, all right?

612
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:34,042
You smell like beef and cheese.

613
00:37:34,077 --> 00:37:35,726
You don't smell like Santa.

614
00:37:35,761 --> 00:37:36,994
Okay.

615
00:37:38,596 --> 00:37:41,531
He's an imposter! He's not
Santa!

616
00:37:42,266 --> 00:37:46,504
He's a fake! He's a fake!
Come here. Come here!

617
00:37:46,539 --> 00:37:47,971
I saw!

618
00:37:49,807 --> 00:37:51,536
He's a fake!

619
00:37:57,147 --> 00:38:00,583
Ha ha! Where you going now?
Where you going...?

620
00:38:02,686 --> 00:38:05,814
Ohh! Ohh!

621
00:38:08,825 --> 00:38:10,656
No!

622
00:38:13,663 --> 00:38:17,033
He's not Santa Claus!

623
00:38:17,068 --> 00:38:18,830
He's not Santa!

624
00:38:21,036 --> 00:38:22,799
"To someone special."

625
00:38:49,564 --> 00:38:51,733
What's that? Intercom.

626
00:38:51,768 --> 00:38:53,835
All right.

627
00:38:56,538 --> 00:39:00,542
Yeah? Mr. Hobbs, the police are
On line one.

628
00:39:00,577 --> 00:39:03,344
Police. Hello?

629
00:39:21,828 --> 00:39:22,528
Dad!

630
00:39:22,563 --> 00:39:24,798
I knew that you'd come,
I love you for coming.

631
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:26,367
Officer tom, this is my dad.

632
00:39:26,402 --> 00:39:27,901
This is Walter... he came.

633
00:39:27,936 --> 00:39:28,700
He bailed me out.

634
00:39:28,735 --> 00:39:29,936
They gave me one phone call.

635
00:39:29,971 --> 00:39:31,103
They gave me one phone call,

636
00:39:31,138 --> 00:39:33,606
And I said," I know who
I'm gonna call...

637
00:39:33,641 --> 00:39:34,272
Walter Hobbs."

638
00:39:34,307 --> 00:39:35,273
And sure enough, you showed up.

639
00:39:35,308 --> 00:39:37,326
You did, they said you weren't
goanna show up.

640
00:39:37,361 --> 00:39:39,988
They told me so many times...
shh shh shh shh shh.

641
00:39:40,023 --> 00:39:42,615
Just who the heck are you,
And what is your problem?

642
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,750
I- I'm buddy, I'm your son.

643
00:39:44,785 --> 00:39:45,850
Wait, um...

644
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:47,737
Tell me, tell me, tell me, uh...

645
00:39:47,772 --> 00:39:49,589
Where'd you get this picture?

646
00:39:49,624 --> 00:39:52,183
Papa elf gave it to me.

647
00:39:53,092 --> 00:39:55,094
Listen... is this some kind a
game?

648
00:39:55,129 --> 00:39:56,646
What do you want, some money?

649
00:39:56,681 --> 00:39:58,128
No! I just wanted to meet you,

650
00:39:58,163 --> 00:40:01,394
And I thought you might Anna
Meet me.

651
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,634
Who wouldn't Anna meet you?

652
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,209
I thought maybe we could make
Gingerbread houses,

653
00:40:11,244 --> 00:40:13,678
And eat cookie dough, and go
Ice skating, and...

654
00:40:13,713 --> 00:40:15,914
And maybe even hold hands.

655
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:17,647
Uh-huh.

656
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:19,775
Come with me. Okay.

657
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:30,650
Okay. What have we got here?

658
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:41,466
Buddy, don't eat those.

659
00:40:46,876 --> 00:40:47,909
Ohh!

660
00:40:47,944 --> 00:40:49,277
We got to really hurry up, Walter,

661
00:40:49,312 --> 00:40:51,948
'cause I'm double booked the
rest of the afternoon.

662
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:52,447
Am I sick?

663
00:40:52,482 --> 00:40:53,750
Yeah, but that's not why we're
Here.

664
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:54,716
We're hereto do a test, come on.

665
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:55,783
What kind test? Just a test to
Find out

666
00:40:55,818 --> 00:40:57,954
If you're my son or not. Why am
I sitting on paper?

667
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:59,973
Because it's sanitary for the
other patients.

668
00:41:00,008 --> 00:41:01,958
Now, sit still so I can do
the finger prick.

669
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:03,577
Finger prick!

670
00:41:03,612 --> 00:41:05,126
Ohh! It's cold.

671
00:41:05,161 --> 00:41:06,212
Yeah, just pleases it still,
Please?

672
00:41:06,247 --> 00:41:07,228
Okay, can I listen to your
necklace?

673
00:41:07,263 --> 00:41:08,831
No, you can't. Will you
Just sit still...

674
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:09,831
Why is there a skeleton?
over there?

675
00:41:09,866 --> 00:41:11,049
I don't know, Walter,
Could you please...?

676
00:41:11,084 --> 00:41:12,192
If I squint it looks like a
pirate flag.

677
00:41:12,227 --> 00:41:13,266
Could you please have him?
Sit still?

678
00:41:13,301 --> 00:41:14,736
Does he have a name? No,
He hasn't got a name.

679
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:15,702
I'm sorry, Ben, I am sorry.

680
00:41:15,737 --> 00:41:16,771
I have a lot of patients
waiting.

681
00:41:16,806 --> 00:41:18,373
Would you please it still?
Please.

682
00:41:18,408 --> 00:41:19,906
He got mad at me. Yes, he did.
He did.

683
00:41:19,941 --> 00:41:22,210
The sooner you sit still,
The sooner we can

684
00:41:22,245 --> 00:41:22,943
Get this mess over with.

685
00:41:22,978 --> 00:41:24,429
Okay. Then can we eat sugar
plums?

686
00:41:24,464 --> 00:41:25,846
You betch a... we'll eat sugar
Plums,

687
00:41:25,881 --> 00:41:28,817
Have gingerbread houses,
And we'll even paint eggs.

688
00:41:28,852 --> 00:41:31,217
Well, paint eggs, that's Easter.

689
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,254
Ow! Ohh...

690
00:41:35,289 --> 00:41:37,356
My finger has a heartbeat.

691
00:41:37,391 --> 00:41:40,194
It won't hurt so much after
a little.

692
00:41:40,229 --> 00:41:41,996
What's your name?

693
00:41:42,031 --> 00:41:43,663
Buddy.

694
00:41:43,698 --> 00:41:45,266
I'm Carolyn.

695
00:41:45,301 --> 00:41:46,733
Hi.

696
00:41:47,201 --> 00:41:48,903
What do you want for Christmas?

697
00:41:48,938 --> 00:41:49,969
A Suzy-talks-a-lot.

698
00:41:50,004 --> 00:41:52,740
I'll put in a good word with
the big man.

699
00:41:52,775 --> 00:41:54,674
Thanks. Your costume is pretty.

700
00:41:54,709 --> 00:41:58,012
Oh, it's not a costume.
I'm an elf.

701
00:41:58,047 --> 00:41:59,913
Well, technically, I'm a human,

702
00:41:59,948 --> 00:42:01,379
But I was raised by elves.

703
00:42:01,414 --> 00:42:04,784
Oh, I'm a human raised by humans.

704
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:07,446
Hmm. Cool.

705
00:42:12,258 --> 00:42:14,783
So?

706
00:42:16,362 --> 00:42:19,566
It's a boy... buddy's your son.

707
00:42:19,601 --> 00:42:21,199
That's very impossible.

708
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:22,835
You... you saw that guy out there.

709
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:24,336
He's... he's certifiably insane.

710
00:42:24,371 --> 00:42:25,769
He's probably just reverting

711
00:42:25,804 --> 00:42:28,407
To a state of childlike
dependency.

712
00:42:28,442 --> 00:42:29,373
An elf?

713
00:42:29,408 --> 00:42:31,443
What he needs is to be nurtured.

714
00:42:31,478 --> 00:42:33,462
Oh, I see.

715
00:42:33,497 --> 00:42:35,412
So, um, uh...

716
00:42:35,447 --> 00:42:37,132
You'd like me to breastfeed him?

717
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:38,782
Walter, just bring him home.

718
00:42:38,817 --> 00:42:39,983
Introduce him to Emily and
Michael,

719
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:42,219
And once... once he comes to
Terms with reality,

720
00:42:42,254 --> 00:42:45,390
He should drop the whole elf
Thing and move on with his life.

721
00:42:45,425 --> 00:42:47,892
I mean, that's what I would do if
I was you.

722
00:42:47,927 --> 00:42:51,462
Oh, my god! Walter, this is...

723
00:42:51,497 --> 00:42:52,762
This is wonderful,

724
00:42:52,797 --> 00:42:54,649
You... you have another son.

725
00:42:54,684 --> 00:42:56,466
Wonderful. Oh, gosh, I...

726
00:42:56,501 --> 00:42:59,303
I guess I never really thought
of it that way.

727
00:42:59,338 --> 00:43:00,737
This is incredible, I...

728
00:43:00,772 --> 00:43:03,024
You know, it's a little
complicated,

729
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:05,276
But it's nothing that we can't
handle.

730
00:43:05,311 --> 00:43:07,744
Honey? What?

731
00:43:07,779 --> 00:43:10,782
He thinks he's an elf.

732
00:43:10,817 --> 00:43:11,880
I'm sorry, what?

733
00:43:11,915 --> 00:43:14,584
He think she's a Christmas elf.

734
00:43:14,619 --> 00:43:15,283
Oh, come on, Walter,

735
00:43:15,318 --> 00:43:19,516
I'm sure he doesn't actually
think he's an elf.

736
00:43:19,623 --> 00:43:22,926
And then, I traveled through
the seven levels

737
00:43:22,961 --> 00:43:24,426
Of the candy cane forest,

738
00:43:24,461 --> 00:43:28,597
Past the sea of swirly-twirly
gumdrops,

739
00:43:28,632 --> 00:43:34,298
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel.

740
00:43:51,821 --> 00:43:53,516
Ahh.

741
00:43:54,957 --> 00:43:58,661
So, where were you for the
last 30 years?

742
00:43:58,696 --> 00:43:59,560
The north pole.

743
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:02,280
Can you pass the maple syrup?
Please?

744
00:44:02,315 --> 00:44:06,159
I... I didn't put... it's
spaghetti.

745
00:44:06,194 --> 00:44:10,004
Oh, you know what? I think
I have some.

746
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:11,437
Yes.

747
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,125
You like sugar, huh?

748
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,910
Is there sugar in syrup?

749
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:17,076
Yes.

750
00:44:17,111 --> 00:44:18,344
Then yes.

751
00:44:18,379 --> 00:44:20,882
We elves try to stick to the
four main food groups

752
00:44:20,917 --> 00:44:26,987
Candy, candy canes, candy corns,
and syrup.

753
00:44:27,022 --> 00:44:30,657
So, will you be staying with us?
Then?

754
00:44:30,692 --> 00:44:31,824
You mean I can stay?

755
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:33,358
Of course you can. Emily.

756
00:44:33,393 --> 00:44:35,896
How... how long do you think
you'll be with us?

757
00:44:35,931 --> 00:44:38,399
I... I hadn't really planned
it out,

758
00:44:38,434 --> 00:44:40,833
But I was thinking, like...
forever.

759
00:44:40,868 --> 00:44:43,604
Emily? Can I just speak to you
for a minute

760
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,402
in the, uh, kitchen, please?

761
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:51,210
Are you crazy? He cannot
stay here.

762
00:44:51,245 --> 00:44:53,344
Clearly he has some serious issues.

763
00:44:53,379 --> 00:44:55,615
We can't just throw him out in
the snow.

764
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:57,483
Why not? He loves the snow.

765
00:44:57,518 --> 00:44:59,531
He's told me 15 times.

766
00:44:59,566 --> 00:45:01,545
Walter, he's your son.

767
00:45:15,433 --> 00:45:17,094
Did you hear that?

768
00:45:18,436 --> 00:45:21,132
You are so weird.

769
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:24,474
Dad?

770
00:45:27,445 --> 00:45:29,208
Dad?

771
00:45:30,081 --> 00:45:32,481
Dad!

772
00:45:33,151 --> 00:45:34,286
What?

773
00:45:38,255 --> 00:45:39,523
What?

774
00:45:43,761 --> 00:45:45,661
I am not gonna tuck you in.

775
00:45:45,696 --> 00:45:49,097
I... I promise I'll go right
to sleep.

776
00:45:51,268 --> 00:45:52,735
Fine.

777
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,361
Tickle fight, tickle fight!
buddy, stop.

778
00:46:02,396 --> 00:46:04,514
Tickle fight. Tickle... stop
stop, stop.

779
00:46:04,549 --> 00:46:06,106
Sorry.

780
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:08,151
It's all right.

781
00:46:08,186 --> 00:46:09,085
Hey, uh...

782
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:12,155
You just lay there and go to
sleep.

783
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:13,468
Okay.

784
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,746
Okay.

785
00:46:15,625 --> 00:46:18,556
Dad? Hmm?

786
00:46:18,591 --> 00:46:21,487
I love you.

787
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,560
Okay. Go to sleep now.

788
00:46:32,007 --> 00:46:33,273
Well, this is really something.

789
00:46:33,308 --> 00:46:37,642
I'm usually the one making
breakfast.

790
00:46:38,647 --> 00:46:41,673
That's good, that's good.

791
00:46:43,018 --> 00:46:44,645
Okay.

792
00:46:51,792 --> 00:46:53,494
Oh, that's good.

793
00:46:53,529 --> 00:46:55,229
Good? Good.

794
00:46:55,264 --> 00:46:56,529
Good.

795
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:59,498
So, did you, um...

796
00:46:59,533 --> 00:47:01,135
Did you sleep okay last night?

797
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:02,702
Great. I got a full 40 minutes.

798
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:06,036
And I had time to build that
rocking horse.

799
00:47:06,173 --> 00:47:10,244
Uh, oh, my gosh. You actually
made that?

800
00:47:10,279 --> 00:47:13,042
Where did you get all the wood?

801
00:47:22,789 --> 00:47:25,675
Good morning, honey. Good
morning, dad.

802
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:28,561
Walter, buddy has made us
breakfast.

803
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:30,530
Isn't that nice?

804
00:47:30,565 --> 00:47:32,349
And lunch.

805
00:47:32,384 --> 00:47:33,776
And lunch.

806
00:47:33,811 --> 00:47:35,133
Bye.

807
00:47:35,168 --> 00:47:36,101
So, dad, how many scoops?

808
00:47:36,136 --> 00:47:39,071
I'll stick with the coffee now,
thanks.

809
00:47:41,306 --> 00:47:42,139
So, dad...

810
00:47:42,174 --> 00:47:43,841
I planned out our whole day.

811
00:47:43,876 --> 00:47:45,042
First, we'll make snow angels
for two hours,

812
00:47:45,077 --> 00:47:47,713
And then we'll go ice skating
and then we'll eat a
whole roll

813
00:47:47,748 --> 00:47:49,782
Of tollhouse cookie dough as fast
as we can,

814
00:47:49,817 --> 00:47:52,117
And then, to finish, we'll snuggle.

815
00:47:52,152 --> 00:47:54,820
I've got to go to work, buddy.

816
00:47:54,855 --> 00:47:56,020
Oh, and another thing...

817
00:47:56,055 --> 00:47:57,856
If you're going to be staying
here,

818
00:47:57,891 --> 00:47:59,658
You should think about, you know,

819
00:47:59,693 --> 00:48:01,325
Getting rid of the costume.

820
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,693
But I've worn this my whole life.

821
00:48:02,728 --> 00:48:05,863
You're not in the North Pole any
longer.

822
00:48:05,898 --> 00:48:08,166
You wanna make me happy, don't you?

823
00:48:08,201 --> 00:48:08,765
More than anything.

824
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,638
Then, lose the tights. I mean,
as soon as possible.

825
00:48:13,673 --> 00:48:15,273
As soon as possible?

826
00:48:15,308 --> 00:48:16,874
As soon as possible.

827
00:48:16,909 --> 00:48:18,273
Okay.

828
00:48:20,078 --> 00:48:21,279
I almost forgot...

829
00:48:21,314 --> 00:48:23,179
Aah! Aah!

830
00:48:26,117 --> 00:48:27,811
Good morning.

831
00:48:32,289 --> 00:48:32,854
Walter here.

832
00:48:32,889 --> 00:48:35,157
It worked, it's you.

833
00:48:35,192 --> 00:48:37,177
How'd you get this number?

834
00:48:37,212 --> 00:48:39,162
Emily left an emergency list.

835
00:48:39,197 --> 00:48:39,761
I see.

836
00:48:39,796 --> 00:48:41,431
And, uh, is this an emergency?

837
00:48:41,466 --> 00:48:42,597
There's a horrible noise

838
00:48:42,632 --> 00:48:45,635
Coming from the evil
box underneath the window.

839
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:46,937
It sounds like this...

840
00:48:50,607 --> 00:48:53,442
It's, uh, it's... it's not evil,
buddy,

841
00:48:53,477 --> 00:48:54,575
It's, uh, it's a radiator,

842
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:56,445
And the heat makes noise when
it comes on.

843
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,649
No, it doesn't. It... It's very
evil.

844
00:48:59,684 --> 00:49:03,303
It's scary to look at. It's...
okay...

845
00:49:03,338 --> 00:49:06,922
I'm going toward... oh, wait.
Yes, it is.

846
00:49:06,957 --> 00:49:08,624
Okay, it's okay. It's okay.

847
00:49:08,659 --> 00:49:09,542
Everything's fine.

848
00:49:09,577 --> 00:49:10,391
You were right.

849
00:49:10,426 --> 00:49:12,928
Okay, good, uh, I'm gonna hang
up now.

850
00:49:12,963 --> 00:49:13,761
I love you.

851
00:49:13,796 --> 00:49:15,481
I'll call you in five minutes.

852
00:49:15,516 --> 00:49:17,130
No, no, buddy, don't, uh...

853
00:49:17,165 --> 00:49:19,701
You... you don't have to call me,
okay?

854
00:49:19,736 --> 00:49:21,267
Good idea, you call me.

855
00:49:21,302 --> 00:49:23,103
Okay. I'm gonna hang up now.

856
00:49:23,138 --> 00:49:24,973
I painted a picture of a
butterfly.

857
00:49:25,008 --> 00:49:27,275
Good. I'm gonna hang up now.

858
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,528
I tuned the piano.

859
00:49:29,563 --> 00:49:31,746
Okay, I love you. Bye.

860
00:49:31,781 --> 00:49:33,713
Mmm...

861
00:49:33,748 --> 00:49:35,340
Mmm... Mmm.

862
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:51,865
Mmm.

863
00:49:52,833 --> 00:49:55,666
Hobbs. Hey!

864
00:49:55,936 --> 00:49:57,369
How you doing? Please, sit
down.

865
00:49:57,404 --> 00:49:59,706
I haven't seen you since
the retreat.

866
00:49:59,741 --> 00:50:00,639
You're looking good.

867
00:50:00,674 --> 00:50:02,092
Oh, thank you very much.
You as well.

868
00:50:02,127 --> 00:50:03,475
To what do I owe the, uh,
pleasure?

869
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:06,910
Well, to be honest, I got a call
from my niece.

870
00:50:07,914 --> 00:50:08,713
She wants to know

871
00:50:08,748 --> 00:50:12,499
How a certain puppy and a
certain pigeon

872
00:50:12,534 --> 00:50:16,250
Escape the clutches of a
certain evil witch.

873
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:18,322
Believe me, uh,

874
00:50:18,357 --> 00:50:19,857
We're already looking for new
printers.

875
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:22,444
This one has obviously gotten a
little sloppy.

876
00:50:22,479 --> 00:50:24,997
Maybe it isn't the printer who's
gotten sloppy.

877
00:50:25,032 --> 00:50:27,198
That's your signature, right?

878
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:30,235
You know, we could sit here and
point fingers all day.

879
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:31,735
I've got news for you...

880
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:34,306
Even if those two pages were
in there,

881
00:50:34,341 --> 00:50:35,739
The book still would have sucked.

882
00:50:35,774 --> 00:50:38,059
Have you seen the numbers for
this quarter?

883
00:50:38,094 --> 00:50:40,345
Uh, they'll be here today. Oh,
they're in.

884
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,247
That frigging puppy and pigeon

885
00:50:42,282 --> 00:50:43,480
Are tanking hard, Hobbs.

886
00:50:43,515 --> 00:50:45,483
My people estimate we're
gonna post

887
00:50:45,518 --> 00:50:47,250
A minus eight for this quarter.

888
00:50:47,285 --> 00:50:50,487
A minus eight! That does not
happen!

889
00:50:50,522 --> 00:50:52,991
You know, we'll... we'll bounce
back, we...

890
00:50:53,026 --> 00:50:54,776
No, no, no. No? Well...

891
00:50:54,811 --> 00:50:56,527
We're gonna ship a new book

892
00:50:56,562 --> 00:50:57,929
The first quarter.

893
00:50:57,964 --> 00:50:59,261
First quarter?

894
00:50:59,296 --> 00:51:01,915
I'm gonna be back in town on
the 24th.

895
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:04,535
At that time, I would love
to hear

896
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:06,302
In exact detail

897
00:51:06,337 --> 00:51:09,534
What your plans are for this
new book.

898
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:13,437
Uh, wait a minute, the, uh
the 24th, that's Christmas
eve.

899
00:51:15,279 --> 00:51:16,245
And?

900
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,213
And, uh...

901
00:51:18,248 --> 00:51:21,284
No problem. Be great to have
you in the loop.

902
00:51:24,387 --> 00:51:27,423
All right, I got every
weapon in the game.

903
00:51:27,458 --> 00:51:29,926
I got full health, I got full
armor.

904
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:30,758
Michael!

905
00:51:30,793 --> 00:51:31,928
I got full...

906
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:33,061
Michael!

907
00:51:33,096 --> 00:51:35,064
It's me buddy!

908
00:51:35,832 --> 00:51:36,531
You know that guy?

909
00:51:36,566 --> 00:51:39,535
No, I've never seen him before.

910
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:42,504
It's me buddy! Your brother!

911
00:51:42,539 --> 00:51:43,870
Oh, man.

912
00:51:43,905 --> 00:51:48,510
No, Michael! Wait! It's your
brother bud...

913
00:51:49,444 --> 00:51:52,072
Sorry. Sorry! Horn honks

914
00:51:52,781 --> 00:51:55,450
Michael! Michael!

915
00:51:55,485 --> 00:51:57,251
Michael!

916
00:51:57,286 --> 00:51:59,621
Michael, wait up!

917
00:51:59,656 --> 00:52:01,223
Michael! Michael!

918
00:52:01,258 --> 00:52:02,756
Wow, you're fast.

919
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:04,643
I'm gladi caught up with you.

920
00:52:04,678 --> 00:52:06,253
I waited five hours for you.

921
00:52:06,288 --> 00:52:07,793
Why is your coat so big?

922
00:52:07,828 --> 00:52:10,314
So, good news... I saw a dog
today.

923
00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:12,800
Have you seen a dog?
You probably have.

924
00:52:12,835 --> 00:52:14,500
How was school? Was it fun?

925
00:52:14,535 --> 00:52:16,437
Did you get a lot of
homework, huh?

926
00:52:16,472 --> 00:52:17,705
Do you have any friends?

927
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,190
Do you have a best friend?

928
00:52:19,225 --> 00:52:20,641
Does he have a big coat, too?

929
00:52:20,676 --> 00:52:22,108
Go away!

930
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:27,607
Ow! Son of a nutcracker!

931
00:52:30,451 --> 00:52:31,883
Run!

932
00:52:32,352 --> 00:52:35,822
Get him! Get the
green guy!

933
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:45,565
Oh, no. These guys are bad news.

934
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,159
We better get outta here.

935
00:52:49,469 --> 00:52:51,970
You know what? We can take 'em.

936
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:55,997
Okay, just start making as
many snowballs as you can.

937
00:53:03,115 --> 00:53:05,515
You ready?

938
00:53:06,452 --> 00:53:09,250
Let's go. Aah! Ow.

939
00:53:10,456 --> 00:53:11,855
Ow!

940
00:53:16,695 --> 00:53:18,560
Run!

941
00:53:26,571 --> 00:53:29,374
Oh, man. One got away.

942
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:30,671
Snowball.

943
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,677
Unh!

944
00:53:41,452 --> 00:53:42,919
Wow.

945
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:46,386
Where did you say you were from?

946
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,623
Oh, yeah

947
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:51,361
Candles burning low

948
00:53:51,396 --> 00:53:54,029
Lots of mistletoe

949
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:59,868
Lots of snow and ice everywhere
we go

950
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:05,442
Choirs singing carols right
outside my door

951
00:54:05,477 --> 00:54:07,445
All these things and more

952
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,412
I wish dad were here.

953
00:54:09,447 --> 00:54:09,677
Why?

954
00:54:09,712 --> 00:54:13,649
'Cause he's the greatest dad in
the whole wide world.

955
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:14,482
Are you kidding?

956
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:17,086
He's the worst dad in the world.

957
00:54:17,121 --> 00:54:18,888
What do you mean?

958
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:20,656
All he does is work.

959
00:54:20,691 --> 00:54:22,056
Working's fun.

960
00:54:22,091 --> 00:54:24,091
Not the way he does it.

961
00:54:24,126 --> 00:54:25,126
All he cares about is money.

962
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:29,265
He doesn't care about you,
or me, or anybody.

963
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:32,097
Well, he is on the naughty list.

964
00:54:36,738 --> 00:54:38,601
You like her?

965
00:54:38,636 --> 00:54:40,464
Like who?

966
00:54:40,608 --> 00:54:42,477
The girl you're staring at.

967
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:44,261
Oh, uh...

968
00:54:44,296 --> 00:54:46,010
Yeah.

969
00:54:47,282 --> 00:54:49,451
Why don't you ask her out?

970
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:50,417
Out?

971
00:54:50,452 --> 00:54:53,555
You know, on a date...
to eat food.

972
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:54,421
Food?

973
00:54:54,456 --> 00:54:57,189
Yes, real food, not candy.

974
00:54:57,224 --> 00:54:59,874
And if she says yes,
you're in.

975
00:54:59,909 --> 00:55:02,524
It's like a secret code
girls have.

976
00:55:04,131 --> 00:55:06,133
Well, look who it is.

977
00:55:06,168 --> 00:55:09,261
Hi, Jovie. Hi.

978
00:55:11,238 --> 00:55:13,006
Oh, uh, this is Michael.

979
00:55:13,041 --> 00:55:14,633
I'm his brother.

980
00:55:15,609 --> 00:55:16,608
Hi.

981
00:55:16,643 --> 00:55:18,444
So, what are you doing here?

982
00:55:18,479 --> 00:55:21,063
Did gimbel's give you your
job back?

983
00:55:21,098 --> 00:55:23,649
No. But things worked out
pretty good.

984
00:55:23,684 --> 00:55:25,708
They gave mea restraining
order.

985
00:55:25,818 --> 00:55:29,789
Well, um, you should probably
get outta here.

986
00:55:29,824 --> 00:55:32,690
Ho ho ho!

987
00:55:32,725 --> 00:55:34,959
But... I really wanted to
see you,

988
00:55:34,994 --> 00:55:39,065
And... and I think you're
beautiful, and I, um...

989
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:42,535
I feel really warm when I
am around you,

990
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:46,834
And, um, my tongue swells up.

991
00:55:50,809 --> 00:55:53,039
So...

992
00:55:53,345 --> 00:55:55,540
Do you wanna go eat food?

993
00:55:56,214 --> 00:55:58,517
Do I... do I wanna eat food?

994
00:55:58,552 --> 00:55:59,483
Mm-hmm.

995
00:55:59,518 --> 00:56:04,820
You know, uh, the code... food.

996
00:56:06,558 --> 00:56:09,685
Well, I just had my lunch
break.

997
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:12,879
Oh, okay. I understand.

998
00:56:12,914 --> 00:56:15,699
But I'm free on Thursday.

999
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,133
Thursday! Thursday!

1000
00:56:18,168 --> 00:56:20,337
Come on. That'd be great.

1001
00:56:20,372 --> 00:56:21,303
All right.

1002
00:56:21,338 --> 00:56:23,072
Was that okay?

1003
00:56:23,107 --> 00:56:25,735
You did great, man.

1004
00:56:26,243 --> 00:56:27,611
What should we put on it
first?

1005
00:56:27,646 --> 00:56:28,996
Lights! Oh, good.

1006
00:56:29,031 --> 00:56:30,312
And then, after that?

1007
00:56:30,347 --> 00:56:33,214
Ornaments! Ornaments, okay.

1008
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:35,683
What the hell's that?

1009
00:56:35,718 --> 00:56:36,986
A Christmas tree.

1010
00:56:37,021 --> 00:56:38,219
A Christmas tree?

1011
00:56:38,254 --> 00:56:41,382
Buddy chopped it down in
the park.

1012
00:56:42,158 --> 00:56:43,591
Emily.

1013
00:56:43,626 --> 00:56:46,229
I don't know what you're making
such a big deal about.

1014
00:56:46,264 --> 00:56:48,265
They were just having a
little fun.

1015
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,231
Oh, fun? So felonies are
fun now?

1016
00:56:50,266 --> 00:56:53,069
I thought, see, felonies
were felonies.

1017
00:56:53,104 --> 00:56:54,035
Okay, the tree thing was bad.

1018
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:55,336
I'll get him to plant
another one.

1019
00:56:55,371 --> 00:56:57,973
But at least Michael is
happy for once.

1020
00:56:58,008 --> 00:57:00,541
What, uh, what's that supposed
to mean?

1021
00:57:00,576 --> 00:57:02,878
Well, I don't think it's any
secret, Walter,

1022
00:57:02,913 --> 00:57:05,180
That you haven't exactly been
there for him.

1023
00:57:05,215 --> 00:57:07,149
I'll tell you what, why don't
we just

1024
00:57:07,184 --> 00:57:09,084
Pull him outta school and let
the, uh,

1025
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,384
Deranged elf man raise him?

1026
00:57:10,419 --> 00:57:13,255
Then they can have lots of
fun committing felonies.

1027
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:16,325
How are we gonna get the star
on top?

1028
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,883
I got it.

1029
00:57:29,804 --> 00:57:30,903
I mean, what are we gonna do?

1030
00:57:30,938 --> 00:57:33,107
We can't... we can't leave him
alone here.

1031
00:57:33,142 --> 00:57:35,632
He's gonna destroy the place.

1032
00:57:37,678 --> 00:57:38,377
Why don't you, um...

1033
00:57:38,412 --> 00:57:39,712
Why don't you take off tomorrow?

1034
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,949
You know, and you could stay
home and watch him?

1035
00:57:41,984 --> 00:57:44,285
Oh, no. No, I can't stay home
tomorrow,

1036
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,637
I have a budget meeting tomorrow.

1037
00:57:45,672 --> 00:57:47,546
Well, honey, I can't take off,

1038
00:57:47,581 --> 00:57:49,019
I'm one... one bad pitch away

1039
00:57:49,054 --> 00:57:50,422
From getting fired... one.

1040
00:57:50,457 --> 00:57:53,376
Well, I tell you what, I have
an idea then.

1041
00:57:53,411 --> 00:57:56,295
Why don't you take buddy to
work with you?

1042
00:58:03,637 --> 00:58:05,805
Hey, Walter. Morning, jack.

1043
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,466
Morning, jack.

1044
00:58:08,108 --> 00:58:09,040
Oh, good morning, Mr. Hobbs.

1045
00:58:09,075 --> 00:58:10,609
Good morning, Sarah. Good
morning, Sarah.

1046
00:58:10,644 --> 00:58:13,679
That's a nice purple dress.
It's very purple-y

1047
00:58:13,714 --> 00:58:15,145
Francisco. How's it going, Mr.
Hobbs?

1048
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:19,284
Francisco, that's fun to say..."
Francisco."

1049
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:21,719
Hi! Hi.

1050
00:58:21,754 --> 00:58:22,653
Do you remember me?

1051
00:58:22,688 --> 00:58:24,603
I do. I didn't recognize you.

1052
00:58:24,638 --> 00:58:26,518
I know, I'm in work clothes.

1053
00:58:30,029 --> 00:58:32,031
Thank you, Deborah.

1054
00:58:32,066 --> 00:58:33,063
Thanks, deb.

1055
00:58:33,098 --> 00:58:34,466
Deb, you have such a pretty face.

1056
00:58:34,501 --> 00:58:35,833
You should be on a Christmas card.

1057
00:58:35,868 --> 00:58:38,301
You just made my day.

1058
00:58:46,144 --> 00:58:47,611
Eww.

1059
00:58:50,348 --> 00:58:51,547
Buddy. Hmm?

1060
00:58:51,582 --> 00:58:53,551
You don't have to drink that.

1061
00:58:53,586 --> 00:58:55,075
Thank you.

1062
00:59:05,195 --> 00:59:07,186
Francisco.

1063
00:59:08,331 --> 00:59:10,856
Francisco.

1064
00:59:12,169 --> 00:59:13,954
Francisco.

1065
00:59:13,989 --> 00:59:15,597
Francisco.

1066
00:59:15,632 --> 00:59:17,206
Buddy?

1067
00:59:19,543 --> 00:59:20,877
Just... just a little.

1068
00:59:28,551 --> 00:59:29,150
Yes, bud?

1069
00:59:29,185 --> 00:59:31,854
Why is your name on the desk?

1070
00:59:31,889 --> 00:59:34,021
I bought the desk.

1071
00:59:34,056 --> 00:59:36,854
My name's there so no one
steals it.

1072
00:59:38,694 --> 00:59:40,512
That's a joke, isn't it, dad?

1073
00:59:40,547 --> 00:59:43,141
Yeah, buddy, that's a joke.

1074
00:59:43,176 --> 00:59:45,735
So, what are we gonna build?

1075
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:47,068
No, uh, we don't do

1076
00:59:47,103 --> 00:59:48,837
That kind of work here, pal.

1077
00:59:50,071 --> 00:59:52,340
Buddy the elf, what's your
favorite color?

1078
00:59:52,375 --> 00:59:53,742
Put that down. Hello?

1079
00:59:53,777 --> 00:59:56,108
Hello? Dial tone

1080
00:59:57,378 --> 00:59:59,881
Please, don't touch anything.

1081
00:59:59,916 --> 01:00:01,348
Sorry.

1082
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:06,186
Hey...

1083
01:00:07,922 --> 01:00:10,024
Bud, have you... have you...

1084
01:00:10,059 --> 01:00:12,127
Have you ever seen a mailroom?

1085
01:00:12,161 --> 01:00:13,360
A mailroom? No.

1086
01:00:13,395 --> 01:00:14,560
No? No.

1087
01:00:14,595 --> 01:00:15,394
Oh, I mean, wow.

1088
01:00:15,429 --> 01:00:18,165
Wow... listen, it's a
place where mail

1089
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,164
From all over the world
comes,

1090
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:21,902
Uh-huh. And they sort it
out there, see?

1091
01:00:21,937 --> 01:00:22,868
And you can touch it all,

1092
01:00:22,903 --> 01:00:24,738
And they put it in these
shiny bins.

1093
01:00:24,773 --> 01:00:26,238
Shiny bins? Right.

1094
01:00:26,273 --> 01:00:28,776
What do ya think? It
sounds great.

1095
01:00:28,811 --> 01:00:29,808
Good.

1096
01:00:29,843 --> 01:00:31,345
Can we go there?

1097
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:32,111
Well, um...

1098
01:00:32,146 --> 01:00:35,349
I gotta work here, maybe... maybe
you can work there.

1099
01:00:35,384 --> 01:00:36,649
Okay, I'll work there.

1100
01:00:39,185 --> 01:00:41,387
Oh, I don't think this is
the place

1101
01:00:41,422 --> 01:00:42,653
My dad was talking about.

1102
01:00:42,688 --> 01:00:44,190
Is there a different mailroom?

1103
01:00:44,225 --> 01:00:46,425
No. This is the only one.

1104
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:48,655
It's not very shiny.

1105
01:00:48,761 --> 01:00:52,764
Now... over here's the trench.

1106
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:54,899
All the mail comes out that
shooter.

1107
01:00:54,934 --> 01:00:59,338
Scan and find the floor each
piece is moving to.

1108
01:00:59,373 --> 01:01:00,304
Put it in a canister

1109
01:01:00,339 --> 01:01:03,942
And shove it up the tube with
the same number.

1110
01:01:03,977 --> 01:01:05,394
You got that?

1111
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:06,777
I think so.

1112
01:01:06,812 --> 01:01:09,781
This place reminds me of
Santa's workshop.

1113
01:01:09,816 --> 01:01:11,314
Except it smells like mushrooms,

1114
01:01:11,349 --> 01:01:14,375
And everyone looks like they
wanna hurt me.

1115
01:01:14,653 --> 01:01:16,655
Uh, greenway's coming in tomorrow,

1116
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:18,255
So, what... what do we got?

1117
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:20,325
Well, Morris and I have been
brainstorming,

1118
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,794
And we've come up with what I
think

1119
01:01:22,829 --> 01:01:24,229
Is a pretty big idea.

1120
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:24,728
Great, what?

1121
01:01:24,763 --> 01:01:27,298
You're gonna love it, it's
fantastic.

1122
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:28,264
What?

1123
01:01:28,299 --> 01:01:31,601
Okay, picture this...

1124
01:01:31,636 --> 01:01:34,903
We bring in miles finch.

1125
01:01:35,806 --> 01:01:37,391
The miles finch?

1126
01:01:37,426 --> 01:01:38,635
The golden ghost.

1127
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:39,809
We bring him in!

1128
01:01:39,844 --> 01:01:42,713
He's written more classics than dr.
Seuss.

1129
01:01:42,748 --> 01:01:43,712
I tain't gonna be easy,

1130
01:01:43,747 --> 01:01:45,347
But I think it's worth a shot.

1131
01:01:45,382 --> 01:01:50,019
My two top writers, my crack team,
my fun squad...

1132
01:01:50,054 --> 01:01:51,686
You came in here pitching me

1133
01:01:51,721 --> 01:01:54,257
The idea of hiring another writer?

1134
01:01:54,292 --> 01:01:55,323
Yeah.

1135
01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:57,519
Miles finch.

1136
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:02,755
I like it. Chuckles

1137
01:02:03,933 --> 01:02:04,866
I like it.

1138
01:02:04,901 --> 01:02:06,970
Then I traveled through the seven
levels

1139
01:02:07,005 --> 01:02:07,936
Of the candy cane forest

1140
01:02:07,971 --> 01:02:12,242
And past the sea of swirly-twirly
gumdrops.

1141
01:02:12,277 --> 01:02:14,708
Ooh!

1142
01:02:14,743 --> 01:02:17,778
Wow... it's sucky.

1143
01:02:17,813 --> 01:02:20,265
Ohh, it's wonderful. Yes!

1144
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,718
That is marvelous how that...

1145
01:02:22,753 --> 01:02:24,484
Oh!

1146
01:02:24,519 --> 01:02:27,038
Oh, it's very sucky.

1147
01:02:27,073 --> 01:02:29,558
It's very... sucky.

1148
01:02:29,593 --> 01:02:30,858
Whoo.

1149
01:02:30,893 --> 01:02:32,761
So, how'd you get here?

1150
01:02:32,796 --> 01:02:34,229
Work release.

1151
01:02:34,264 --> 01:02:35,329
Mm.

1152
01:02:35,364 --> 01:02:37,898
Oh, syrup and coffee?

1153
01:02:37,932 --> 01:02:41,235
Why didn't I think of that? Can I
try some?

1154
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:42,368
Be my guest.

1155
01:02:42,403 --> 01:02:43,870
Very generous of you.

1156
01:02:43,905 --> 01:02:48,308
Mmm. I love syrup.

1157
01:02:50,311 --> 01:02:52,506
Ohh, I love it.

1158
01:02:53,748 --> 01:02:55,715
Mmm...

1159
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:58,552
You know, I know I sound like a
broken record,

1160
01:02:58,587 --> 01:02:59,518
But we are buddies.

1161
01:02:59,553 --> 01:03:01,789
You're my best friend, that's it.

1162
01:03:01,824 --> 01:03:02,520
You're my best friend.

1163
01:03:02,555 --> 01:03:05,258
You know, buddy, nobody around
here listens to me.

1164
01:03:05,293 --> 01:03:07,427
I got really good ideas. Yeah?
I believe it.

1165
01:03:07,462 --> 01:03:09,462
I know, I'm right, I listen to you.

1166
01:03:09,497 --> 01:03:10,395
You have great ideas.

1167
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:12,332
I just try to go with the flow,
you know?

1168
01:03:12,367 --> 01:03:13,484
Good, you go with the flow.

1169
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:14,566
Yeah. Go with the flow.

1170
01:03:14,601 --> 01:03:15,985
No, I gotta get out of the flow.

1171
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:17,335
Well, then get out of the flow.

1172
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:18,536
I'm in the flow, that's what got
me here.

1173
01:03:18,571 --> 01:03:22,008
I gotta... I'm 26 years old, I got
nothing to show for it.

1174
01:03:22,043 --> 01:03:24,010
You're young. You're so young.

1175
01:03:24,978 --> 01:03:25,777
My papa... yeah?

1176
01:03:25,812 --> 01:03:30,449
He didn't make master tinker till
he was 490,so...

1177
01:03:33,319 --> 01:03:35,054
Four-hundred and ninety? Yeah.

1178
01:03:36,555 --> 01:03:39,057
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!

1179
01:03:39,092 --> 01:03:41,525
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!

1180
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:45,064
My favorite book of yours has
gotta be Gus' pickles.

1181
01:03:45,099 --> 01:03:48,284
It's existential, yet it's so
accessible.

1182
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:51,211
Uh, Mr. Finch, uh, Eugene Dupris
here.

1183
01:03:51,246 --> 01:03:54,105
It's a thrill just to be talking
to you

1184
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:55,305
On our speakerphone.

1185
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:57,375
Miles, um, so, what do you think?

1186
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:58,308
Can you fly in tomorrow?

1187
01:03:58,343 --> 01:04:00,611
I'll give you five hours tomorrow,

1188
01:04:00,646 --> 01:04:01,811
Not a minute more.

1189
01:04:01,846 --> 01:04:02,879
Oh, that's... that's great.

1190
01:04:02,914 --> 01:04:06,551
I'd like a black s500to receive
me at the airport.

1191
01:04:06,586 --> 01:04:08,353
I need the interior of that car

1192
01:04:08,388 --> 01:04:10,353
To be 71 degrees exactly.

1193
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:12,123
We can do that.
Mr. Hobbs?

1194
01:04:12,158 --> 01:04:13,858
There's a situation downstairs.

1195
01:04:13,893 --> 01:04:15,058
I'm sorry, what?

1196
01:04:15,092 --> 01:04:16,291
No, hold on, miles. Deb, hang up.

1197
01:04:16,326 --> 01:04:18,460
I do not hold. Do not put
me on hold.

1198
01:04:18,495 --> 01:04:21,098
We have a problem in the
mailroom.

1199
01:04:21,133 --> 01:04:21,964
What's going on?

1200
01:04:21,999 --> 01:04:24,000
Don't speak... Deborah, hang up!

1201
01:04:24,035 --> 01:04:26,002
That's it, I'm gone. Miles!

1202
01:04:28,872 --> 01:04:31,458
I'll be there tomorrow... 71
degrees.

1203
01:04:31,493 --> 01:04:34,044
Sir, chuck in the mailroom

1204
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:35,546
Needs to talk to you.

1205
01:04:35,581 --> 01:04:36,979
Chuck... what, chuck?

1206
01:04:37,014 --> 01:04:38,513
I mean, what could be going on
down there

1207
01:04:38,548 --> 01:04:40,583
That's so important you had to
interrupt me, what?

1208
01:04:40,618 --> 01:04:42,519
Whoomp, there it is! A little
louder

1209
01:04:42,554 --> 01:04:44,420
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

1210
01:04:44,455 --> 01:04:46,320
Whoomp! There it is

1211
01:04:46,355 --> 01:04:47,756
Upside down and inside out hey!

1212
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:49,158
I'm 'bout to show all you folks

1213
01:04:49,193 --> 01:04:50,591
What it's all about hey!

1214
01:04:50,626 --> 01:04:51,826
Time for me to get on the mike

1215
01:04:51,861 --> 01:04:53,429
And make this mother of a party
hype

1216
01:04:53,464 --> 01:04:55,081
I'm taking you back to the old
school

1217
01:04:55,116 --> 01:04:56,664
'cause I'm an old fool who's so cool

1218
01:04:56,699 --> 01:04:58,501
If you wanna get down, I'm gonna
show you the way

1219
01:04:58,536 --> 01:05:00,636
Whoomp, there it is, let me hear
you say

1220
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:02,789
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

1221
01:05:02,824 --> 01:05:04,865
Whoomp! There it is a little louder

1222
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,908
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

1223
01:05:06,943 --> 01:05:08,576
Whoomp, there it is!

1224
01:05:11,012 --> 01:05:11,479
Coming.

1225
01:05:17,118 --> 01:05:18,536
Hi.

1226
01:05:18,571 --> 01:05:19,919
Wow.

1227
01:05:19,954 --> 01:05:21,689
You look miraculous.

1228
01:05:21,724 --> 01:05:23,058
So do you.

1229
01:05:23,093 --> 01:05:24,357
Thank you.

1230
01:05:24,392 --> 01:05:26,394
What would you like to do?

1231
01:05:26,429 --> 01:05:28,486
I got some ideas.

1232
01:05:32,566 --> 01:05:36,503
Just reach out in front of you and
and take a sip.

1233
01:05:36,538 --> 01:05:39,961
Don't look. There you go.

1234
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:43,576
Well?

1235
01:05:43,944 --> 01:05:46,647
It tastes like a crappy cup
of coffee.

1236
01:05:46,682 --> 01:05:48,911
No.

1237
01:05:50,484 --> 01:05:52,184
It is a crappy cup of coffee.

1238
01:05:52,219 --> 01:05:54,685
No, it's the world's best cup
of coffee.

1239
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:58,458
The trick is to not get your arm caught
in the door!

1240
01:05:58,493 --> 01:06:01,959
Also, never close your eyes' cause
then

1241
01:06:01,994 --> 01:06:05,665
Okay, when you feel comfortable, you
just jump in!

1242
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,398
what are you doing?

1243
01:06:07,433 --> 01:06:10,486
I'm skipping. I'm skipping.
I'm skipping.

1244
01:06:10,521 --> 01:06:13,539
Wait, wait, wait... one more, one more.

1245
01:06:13,574 --> 01:06:16,235
Now, look at the size of this one.

1246
01:06:21,746 --> 01:06:23,611
Come with me.

1247
01:06:24,449 --> 01:06:25,549
Watch out.

1248
01:06:25,584 --> 01:06:27,615
Yellow ones don't stop.

1249
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,647
The yellow ones don't stop.

1250
01:06:35,127 --> 01:06:39,257
Wow... that's a big one.

1251
01:07:00,017 --> 01:07:01,368
I'm sorry.

1252
01:07:01,403 --> 01:07:02,685
You missed.

1253
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,655
What do you mean I missed?

1254
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:06,178
You missed.

1255
01:07:26,009 --> 01:07:27,610
Miles finch.

1256
01:07:27,645 --> 01:07:29,211
Miles finch.

1257
01:07:31,146 --> 01:07:33,046
Miles finch.

1258
01:07:35,617 --> 01:07:36,984
All right, let's do this.

1259
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:39,354
Miles, I'm so happy you could come
Uh...

1260
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:39,720
Yeah.

1261
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:42,391
I'm Walter Hobbs. Yeah, let's get
the, uh...

1262
01:07:42,426 --> 01:07:45,027
Taken care of so we can get started
here.

1263
01:07:45,062 --> 01:07:46,756
Here you go.

1264
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:49,696
Great.

1265
01:07:49,731 --> 01:07:52,217
All right... clears throat

1266
01:07:52,252 --> 01:07:54,702
What have you guys got so far?

1267
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,037
Go ahead.

1268
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:57,303
Uh...

1269
01:07:57,338 --> 01:08:00,575
We were thinking, uh, something
like this, uh...

1270
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:02,542
We open on a young tomato.

1271
01:08:02,577 --> 01:08:04,712
He's had some tough times down
at the farm

1272
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,581
With, you know, a rabbit, and...

1273
01:08:06,616 --> 01:08:08,166
No. No tomatoes...

1274
01:08:08,201 --> 01:08:09,682
Too vulnerable.

1275
01:08:09,717 --> 01:08:11,268
Kids, they're already vulnerable.

1276
01:08:11,303 --> 01:08:12,996
No, you see? I... I told you guys.

1277
01:08:13,031 --> 01:08:14,689
I told them the very same thing...

1278
01:08:14,724 --> 01:08:15,321
And no farms.

1279
01:08:15,356 --> 01:08:17,792
Every body's pushing small town
rural.

1280
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:20,227
A farm book would just be white
noise.

1281
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:21,059
What about this?

1282
01:08:21,094 --> 01:08:24,062
Uh, a tribe of asparagus children,

1283
01:08:24,097 --> 01:08:28,727
But they're self-conscious about
the way their pee smells.

1284
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,775
Apparently, all we have is
vegetables.

1285
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:37,060
I have no time, so, you know,

1286
01:08:37,095 --> 01:08:38,276
If you've got a story here...

1287
01:08:38,311 --> 01:08:41,114
I've got about five or six great
starts here.

1288
01:08:41,149 --> 01:08:43,182
I've got one idea that
I'm especially

1289
01:08:43,217 --> 01:08:45,401
Psyched out of my mind about.

1290
01:08:45,436 --> 01:08:47,295
You know, it's one of those ideas

1291
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:49,154
Where you're just like, uh...

1292
01:08:49,189 --> 01:08:50,054
Yes!

1293
01:08:50,089 --> 01:08:52,289
Whoa!

1294
01:08:52,324 --> 01:08:54,692
Uh, great, c-could we hear it?

1295
01:08:54,727 --> 01:08:58,097
I'll start with the cover.
Picture this... you got, uh

1296
01:08:58,132 --> 01:09:00,867
Dad! I'm in love, I'm in love,

1297
01:09:00,902 --> 01:09:03,602
And I don't care who knows it!

1298
01:09:03,637 --> 01:09:04,301
Buddy, not now, uh,

1299
01:09:04,336 --> 01:09:06,620
Can you please go back to the...
to the pit?

1300
01:09:06,655 --> 01:09:08,906
I'll come and visit you in a
little while, okay?

1301
01:09:08,941 --> 01:09:12,375
I didn't know you had elves
working here.

1302
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:17,315
Oh... boy, you're... you're hilarious,
my friend.

1303
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:19,582
He doesn't, uh... get back to

1304
01:09:19,617 --> 01:09:22,287
The story, please. All right, okay.

1305
01:09:23,421 --> 01:09:24,887
So, on the cover above the title...

1306
01:09:24,922 --> 01:09:27,274
Does Santa know that you left the
workshop?

1307
01:09:27,309 --> 01:09:29,592
You know, we're all laughing our
heads off.

1308
01:09:29,627 --> 01:09:31,762
Did you have to borrow a reindeer
to get down here?

1309
01:09:31,797 --> 01:09:33,630
Buddy... go back to the basement.

1310
01:09:33,665 --> 01:09:35,163
Hey, jack weed,

1311
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:36,765
I get more action in a week

1312
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,166
Than you've had your entire life.

1313
01:09:38,201 --> 01:09:41,805
I've got houses in I.e., Paris,
and Vail,

1314
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,205
Oh. Each one of them

1315
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,242
with a 70-inchplasma screen.

1316
01:09:45,277 --> 01:09:46,708
So, I suggest you wipe

1317
01:09:46,743 --> 01:09:48,110
That stupid smile off your face

1318
01:09:48,145 --> 01:09:50,714
Before I come over there and smack
it off!

1319
01:09:50,749 --> 01:09:52,382
You feeling strong, my friend?!

1320
01:09:52,417 --> 01:09:55,817
Call me elf one more time!

1321
01:09:59,789 --> 01:10:02,656
He's an angry elf.

1322
01:10:05,361 --> 01:10:08,262
Look at you.

1323
01:10:10,199 --> 01:10:12,168
Ow! Hey, what...

1324
01:10:12,203 --> 01:10:12,933
Aah!

1325
01:10:12,968 --> 01:10:14,670
I wasn't ready for that.

1326
01:10:14,705 --> 01:10:16,956
Aah! Hey, hey, hey!

1327
01:10:16,991 --> 01:10:19,208
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa!

1328
01:10:19,243 --> 01:10:19,673
Ooh...

1329
01:10:19,708 --> 01:10:21,676
Call me elf one more time!

1330
01:10:21,711 --> 01:10:23,457
Call me elf!

1331
01:10:23,492 --> 01:10:25,203
You're an elf.

1332
01:10:30,518 --> 01:10:34,249
Miles, I'm sorry, he... he thinks
he's an elf.

1333
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:35,989
Listen, miles...

1334
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:38,523
Listen, miles! Door slams

1335
01:10:38,558 --> 01:10:41,023
He must be a South Pole elf.

1336
01:10:43,365 --> 01:10:45,049
You get the hell outta here.

1337
01:10:45,084 --> 01:10:46,392
Where do you want me to go?

1338
01:10:46,427 --> 01:10:47,666
I don't care where you go.

1339
01:10:47,701 --> 01:10:48,969
I don't care that you're an elf!

1340
01:10:49,004 --> 01:10:50,738
I don't care that you're nuts!

1341
01:10:50,773 --> 01:10:52,473
I don't care that you're my son!

1342
01:10:52,508 --> 01:10:55,408
Get out of my life now!

1343
01:11:05,853 --> 01:11:06,852
Hi, it's me.

1344
01:11:06,887 --> 01:11:08,419
I really can't talk right now.

1345
01:11:08,454 --> 01:11:10,722
Well, just tell me how the pitch
went.

1346
01:11:10,757 --> 01:11:13,526
I'm gonna be a little later than
I thought, okay?

1347
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:15,795
Well, don't be too late, Walter,

1348
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:17,547
It's Christmas Eve.

1349
01:11:17,582 --> 01:11:19,230
Walter... wait, um.

1350
01:11:19,265 --> 01:11:21,401
Honey, I gotta go, okay? Love ya.

1351
01:11:21,436 --> 01:11:23,562
Oh, say hi to buddy.

1352
01:11:24,437 --> 01:11:26,037
What? Walter, breakthrough.

1353
01:11:26,072 --> 01:11:28,307
We found this in the conference
room.

1354
01:11:28,342 --> 01:11:28,773
What is it?

1355
01:11:28,808 --> 01:11:30,708
It's miles finch's notebook.

1356
01:11:30,743 --> 01:11:33,912
This thing is chock full of
genius ideas.

1357
01:11:33,947 --> 01:11:34,544
I mean, look at that.

1358
01:11:34,579 --> 01:11:38,450
And his best idea is about a
peach that lives on a farm.

1359
01:11:38,485 --> 01:11:40,752
What's more vulnerable than a
peach?

1360
01:11:40,787 --> 01:11:41,385
What, uh, what do we do?

1361
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:44,756
I think we should go with the
first pitch... it's genius.

1362
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:45,389
Uh, how much time we got?

1363
01:11:45,424 --> 01:11:47,292
We got, like, 45 minutes. Well,
come on, let's, uh,

1364
01:11:47,327 --> 01:11:49,294
Try to get a storyboard or
something ready.

1365
01:11:49,329 --> 01:11:50,527
Come on, let's do it. Just try.

1366
01:11:50,562 --> 01:11:53,064
No, you can't sit down and get a
storyboard ready.

1367
01:11:53,099 --> 01:11:54,599
Go and get a storyboard ready.

1368
01:11:54,634 --> 01:11:56,862
Oh, boy! Go.

1369
01:11:59,503 --> 01:12:03,038
"I'm sorry I ruined your lives

1370
01:12:03,073 --> 01:12:07,977
"And crammed 11 cookies into
the vcr.

1371
01:12:08,012 --> 01:12:13,416
"I don't belong here. I don't
belong anywhere.

1372
01:12:13,851 --> 01:12:19,390
I'll never forget you. Love,
buddy."

1373
01:12:19,425 --> 01:12:20,823
God...

1374
01:12:31,968 --> 01:12:33,492
Hey, buddy.

1375
01:12:36,105 --> 01:12:37,572
Buddy?

1376
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:45,547
As you know, we need a big
launch fast

1377
01:12:45,582 --> 01:12:46,880
To get the company back on
track.

1378
01:12:46,915 --> 01:12:50,152
So, I think I speak for my fellow
board members

1379
01:12:50,187 --> 01:12:53,322
When I say... this better be good.

1380
01:12:53,357 --> 01:12:55,908
Before I get into the story, uh,

1381
01:12:55,943 --> 01:12:58,460
Let me start with the cover, okay?

1382
01:12:58,495 --> 01:13:00,763
Now, just picture this...

1383
01:13:00,798 --> 01:13:02,715
Dad! I gotta talk to you.

1384
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:04,633
Michael, what is it?

1385
01:13:04,668 --> 01:13:05,866
Buddy ran away.

1386
01:13:05,901 --> 01:13:08,286
What? He... he left a note.

1387
01:13:08,321 --> 01:13:10,636
I'm scared, dad, he's gone.

1388
01:13:10,671 --> 01:13:13,140
Uh, let me just finish this
meeting,

1389
01:13:13,175 --> 01:13:15,575
And then, um, we'll figure it
out, okay?

1390
01:13:15,610 --> 01:13:20,014
Figure out what? Buddy cares
about everybody.

1391
01:13:20,049 --> 01:13:22,175
All you care about is yourself.

1392
01:13:23,918 --> 01:13:26,409
Hey, Michael.

1393
01:13:27,088 --> 01:13:28,555
Wait.

1394
01:13:31,859 --> 01:13:35,362
We're gonna have to reschedule
this, uh, Mr. Greenway.

1395
01:13:35,397 --> 01:13:36,780
We don't have time to reschedule.

1396
01:13:36,815 --> 01:13:38,164
I wanna hear the damn thing now.

1397
01:13:38,199 --> 01:13:39,331
Son, you'll have to wait.

1398
01:13:39,366 --> 01:13:43,393
No, d-don't tell my kid what
to do, uh...

1399
01:13:43,937 --> 01:13:46,907
Can't... can't we do this another
time, Mr. Greenway?

1400
01:13:46,942 --> 01:13:49,709
I flew in just to hear this pitch,

1401
01:13:49,744 --> 01:13:51,009
And I intend to.

1402
01:13:51,044 --> 01:13:52,511
It's gonna have to wait.

1403
01:13:52,546 --> 01:13:54,546
If you wanna keep your job, Hobbs,

1404
01:13:54,581 --> 01:13:57,550
You will pitch me this book
right now.

1405
01:14:04,557 --> 01:14:07,605
Well... up yours.

1406
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:10,654
Yeah, up yours. Hey.

1407
01:14:12,064 --> 01:14:13,564
Hobbs... Hobbs!

1408
01:14:13,599 --> 01:14:15,366
Hobbs, you walk out of here,

1409
01:14:15,401 --> 01:14:17,937
And... and you're finished at
greenway!

1410
01:14:17,972 --> 01:14:19,495
You're finished!

1411
01:14:36,721 --> 01:14:39,713
I don't belong anywhere.

1412
01:14:41,993 --> 01:14:43,978
Buddy!

1413
01:14:44,013 --> 01:14:45,929
Buddy!

1414
01:14:45,964 --> 01:14:48,124
Buddy, where are you?!

1415
01:14:55,606 --> 01:15:00,010
Prancer, pull! Come on! Come on!

1416
01:15:00,045 --> 01:15:03,580
Vixen, up, up!

1417
01:15:03,615 --> 01:15:05,707
Santa?

1418
01:15:06,116 --> 01:15:09,119
Come on, you can do it.

1419
01:15:09,154 --> 01:15:12,747
Pull up! Pull up!

1420
01:15:20,596 --> 01:15:22,663
Dad! What?

1421
01:15:22,698 --> 01:15:24,200
Michael, where you going?

1422
01:15:24,235 --> 01:15:25,565
Michael!

1423
01:15:43,685 --> 01:15:44,050
Santa.

1424
01:15:44,085 --> 01:15:48,790
Back off, slick. You'll scare
the deer.

1425
01:15:48,825 --> 01:15:51,559
Buddy, is that you?

1426
01:15:51,594 --> 01:15:52,492
Are you okay?

1427
01:15:52,527 --> 01:15:55,095
Boy, am I glad to see you.

1428
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:59,034
The Claus meter suddenly just
dropped down to zero.

1429
01:15:59,069 --> 01:16:02,670
There's just no Christmas
spirit anymore.

1430
01:16:02,705 --> 01:16:05,684
And then the strain was too
Much...

1431
01:16:05,719 --> 01:16:08,664
The engine broke free of her
mounts.

1432
01:16:13,647 --> 01:16:16,181
I need an elf's help.

1433
01:16:16,216 --> 01:16:18,718
I... I'm not an elf, Santa.

1434
01:16:18,753 --> 01:16:21,186
I... I can't do anything right.

1435
01:16:21,221 --> 01:16:26,059
Buddy, you're more of an elf than
anyone I ever met,

1436
01:16:26,094 --> 01:16:28,462
And the only one who I would want

1437
01:16:28,497 --> 01:16:30,830
Working on my sleigh tonight.

1438
01:16:30,865 --> 01:16:32,764
Really? Really.

1439
01:16:32,799 --> 01:16:35,418
Will you fix it for me, buddy?

1440
01:16:35,453 --> 01:16:38,037
I'll try. Papa taught me how.

1441
01:16:38,072 --> 01:16:38,836
You gotta find it first.

1442
01:16:38,871 --> 01:16:41,674
It dropped off the sleigh back
over there a ways.

1443
01:16:41,709 --> 01:16:44,610
The engine? The engine, yeah.

1444
01:16:44,645 --> 01:16:47,714
Go, buddy. Go, Mr. Elf!

1445
01:16:49,114 --> 01:16:50,747
I'm standing here outside
central park

1446
01:16:50,782 --> 01:16:54,319
Where it is unclear exactly
what has happened.

1447
01:16:54,354 --> 01:16:56,221
What we do know is that
authorities

1448
01:16:56,256 --> 01:16:57,054
Have closed the park

1449
01:16:57,089 --> 01:16:58,321
And are in the process of
clearing it.

1450
01:16:58,356 --> 01:17:01,093
The only thing that people can
seem to agree on here

1451
01:17:01,128 --> 01:17:04,596
Is that they saw something fall
from the sky.

1452
01:17:04,631 --> 01:17:05,829
I've got an eyewitness with me

1453
01:17:05,864 --> 01:17:08,066
Who claims to have seen the whole
thing firsthand.

1454
01:17:08,101 --> 01:17:09,266
What did you actually see?

1455
01:17:09,301 --> 01:17:11,837
You know, I was walking around and
I saw this thing,

1456
01:17:11,872 --> 01:17:14,105
And my daughter actually pointed
it out to me.

1457
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:15,173
Oh, your daughter saw it?

1458
01:17:15,208 --> 01:17:16,172
Sweetheart, can you tell me

1459
01:17:16,207 --> 01:17:18,576
What you saw falling out of the
sky?

1460
01:17:18,611 --> 01:17:20,277
It was Santa's sleigh!

1461
01:17:21,912 --> 01:17:23,781
Santa's sleigh, well, there you
have it.

1462
01:17:23,816 --> 01:17:24,613
Santa's in Manhattan.

1463
01:17:24,648 --> 01:17:27,818
Sorry to interrupt your first big
news story, charlotte,

1464
01:17:27,853 --> 01:17:29,988
But New York one has just received

1465
01:17:30,023 --> 01:17:32,124
Some exclusive amateur news footage

1466
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:34,190
That you just might Anna follow
up on.

1467
01:17:34,225 --> 01:17:37,627
There seems to be a strange man
dressed as an elf

1468
01:17:37,662 --> 01:17:39,094
Wandering through central park.

1469
01:17:39,129 --> 01:17:42,132
Now, I don't know if this is the
kind of hard-hitting news

1470
01:17:42,167 --> 01:17:44,167
You're used to covering in buffalo,
charlotte,

1471
01:17:44,202 --> 01:17:45,769
Oh, my god. But here at New York one,

1472
01:17:45,804 --> 01:17:48,260
News is top priority.

1473
01:17:58,782 --> 01:18:01,283
What the heck...?

1474
01:18:01,318 --> 01:18:03,183
Hey!

1475
01:18:03,619 --> 01:18:06,315
You found it. Buddy!

1476
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,211
I need to tell you something.

1477
01:18:13,246 --> 01:18:14,321
No, no. Buddy, there's something

1478
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:15,362
I have to tell you right now.

1479
01:18:15,397 --> 01:18:19,268
Um, I didn't mean anything I said back
there, not word.

1480
01:18:19,303 --> 01:18:23,305
I know you may be a little, um, um...

1481
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:24,705
Uh, chemically imbalanced,

1482
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:27,475
But you've been right about a lot
of things.

1483
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:30,909
I... I don't want you to leave.

1484
01:18:30,944 --> 01:18:34,308
You're my son, and I... love you.

1485
01:18:41,656 --> 01:18:42,421
Uh, buddy, uh...

1486
01:18:42,456 --> 01:18:45,326
What was it you wanted to tell me?

1487
01:18:45,361 --> 01:18:47,695
Oh, right. Come with me.

1488
01:18:47,730 --> 01:18:49,492
Right. Come on.

1489
01:18:55,735 --> 01:18:57,169
I'm herewith another eyewitness

1490
01:18:57,204 --> 01:18:59,506
Who has his own version of what
happened.

1491
01:18:59,541 --> 01:19:00,639
Sir, what did you see?

1492
01:19:00,674 --> 01:19:01,873
I think you're great, charlotte.

1493
01:19:01,908 --> 01:19:03,693
Uh, I saw something fall from the
sky

1494
01:19:03,728 --> 01:19:05,478
Right into the middle of central
park.

1495
01:19:05,513 --> 01:19:07,848
I mean, you're a great news lady.

1496
01:19:07,883 --> 01:19:08,647
Thank you.

1497
01:19:08,682 --> 01:19:09,681
Could you tell me a bit more?

1498
01:19:09,716 --> 01:19:11,034
About what you saw fall from the
sky?

1499
01:19:11,069 --> 01:19:12,317
Yeah, yeah. Your eyes tell the
story,

1500
01:19:12,352 --> 01:19:14,353
That's what I love about you.
You've got a great mouth.

1501
01:19:14,388 --> 01:19:16,806
The thing just dropped in the middle of
central park.

1502
01:19:16,841 --> 01:19:19,225
It was amazing, and everybody's, like,
going crazy.

1503
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:21,193
Dick, uh, according to authorities,

1504
01:19:21,228 --> 01:19:22,393
The area has been cleared.

1505
01:19:22,428 --> 01:19:25,998
Only the central park rangers now
remain in the park.

1506
01:19:26,033 --> 01:19:27,833
These forces are highly trained,

1507
01:19:27,868 --> 01:19:29,200
But rarely see action.

1508
01:19:29,235 --> 01:19:32,371
Some have accused them of being
too gung ho

1509
01:19:32,406 --> 01:19:33,270
When called into duty,

1510
01:19:33,305 --> 01:19:36,041
And their controversial crowd
control tactics

1511
01:19:36,076 --> 01:19:38,776
At the Simon and Garfunkel concert
in '85

1512
01:19:38,811 --> 01:19:41,112
Are still under investigation.

1513
01:19:41,147 --> 01:19:43,379
I knew you'd find it, Mr. Elf!

1514
01:19:43,414 --> 01:19:46,747
Slap it on real quick, we've got
to get going.

1515
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:50,388
That ta boy.

1516
01:19:53,424 --> 01:19:56,156
So, uh... you're, uh...

1517
01:19:56,191 --> 01:19:58,889
Santa Claus. Right.

1518
01:20:00,031 --> 01:20:04,001
Would you mind taking this to
your firstborn?

1519
01:20:04,036 --> 01:20:04,499
Sure.

1520
01:20:04,534 --> 01:20:07,738
Um, uh, and my firstborn, he's
an elf?

1521
01:20:07,773 --> 01:20:11,401
Yes. Actually, I'm adopted.

1522
01:20:11,742 --> 01:20:15,769
Uh, Michael, would you open this
hatch for me, please?

1523
01:20:21,451 --> 01:20:23,518
That ta boy, thank you.

1524
01:20:23,553 --> 01:20:27,256
So, you're really Santa Claus?

1525
01:20:27,291 --> 01:20:29,992
You never can tell, kid.

1526
01:20:30,027 --> 01:20:30,825
Tell me, Michael,

1527
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:32,561
What do you want for Christmas?

1528
01:20:32,596 --> 01:20:35,715
I wanted a skateboard.

1529
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:39,277
Oh, not just skateboard.

1530
01:20:39,312 --> 01:20:42,805
Arealhuf board. Looked here.

1531
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,238
Looked here...

1532
01:20:44,273 --> 01:20:46,342
How do you like them apples?

1533
01:20:46,377 --> 01:20:49,072
Go look and see.

1534
01:20:55,383 --> 01:20:56,850
Whoa.

1535
01:21:03,558 --> 01:21:04,557
What happened?

1536
01:21:04,592 --> 01:21:07,329
You made my sleigh fly.

1537
01:21:07,364 --> 01:21:08,061
What do you mean?

1538
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:10,263
Well, before the turbine days,

1539
01:21:10,298 --> 01:21:13,301
This baby used to run solely on
Christmas spirit.

1540
01:21:13,336 --> 01:21:16,721
You believed in me. You made my
sleigh fly.

1541
01:21:16,756 --> 01:21:20,072
Hold it... if you're really Santa
Claus,

1542
01:21:20,107 --> 01:21:22,543
Then we can just get some news
cameras in here,

1543
01:21:22,578 --> 01:21:23,761
And everyone will believe in you,

1544
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:24,910
Then your sleigh will fly, right?

1545
01:21:24,945 --> 01:21:27,948
Christmas spirit is about believing,
not seeing.

1546
01:21:27,983 --> 01:21:30,916
If the whole world saw me,
all would be lost.

1547
01:21:30,951 --> 01:21:35,122
The paparazzi have been trying to
nail me for years.

1548
01:21:37,925 --> 01:21:39,392
Hey, look!

1549
01:21:48,334 --> 01:21:52,105
It's the central park rangers.

1550
01:21:56,342 --> 01:22:01,644
Dad, Michael... I got a plan.

1551
01:22:09,388 --> 01:22:12,089
Whoa, wait! Wait, Michael...
my list!

1552
01:22:12,124 --> 01:22:14,893
You bring that list back right now,
you hear me?!

1553
01:22:14,928 --> 01:22:16,962
Come on, give me your hat and coat.

1554
01:22:16,997 --> 01:22:19,897
Mrs. Claus made them for me.

1555
01:22:24,169 --> 01:22:27,161
Hey! Hey, here I am!

1556
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:29,972
Ho ho ho!

1557
01:22:30,007 --> 01:22:34,671
Hey, ho ho ho! Hey! Hey!

1558
01:22:42,053 --> 01:22:44,086
Excuse me. Thank you. Excuse me.

1559
01:22:44,121 --> 01:22:46,057
So the authorities have not
discovered

1560
01:22:46,092 --> 01:22:47,890
Any reindeer in the park?

1561
01:22:47,925 --> 01:22:49,443
No, no reindeer. Sleigh bells?

1562
01:22:49,478 --> 01:22:50,703
No, no sleigh bells, either.

1563
01:22:50,738 --> 01:22:51,894
Elves? Excuse me, please.

1564
01:22:51,929 --> 01:22:53,096
None of that, we really just
need everyone...

1565
01:22:53,131 --> 01:22:54,162
It's him, it's the real Santa!

1566
01:22:54,197 --> 01:22:55,965
His sleigh won't fly,' cause nobody
believes in him!

1567
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,901
Did you see something
in the park?

1568
01:22:57,936 --> 01:22:58,533
Everyone out there,

1569
01:22:58,568 --> 01:23:01,071
Santa needs us to believe,
I can prove he's real.

1570
01:23:01,106 --> 01:23:01,903
Look, this is his list!

1571
01:23:01,938 --> 01:23:04,906
Okay... well, further confirmation

1572
01:23:04,941 --> 01:23:07,510
That there has been a Santa
sighting tonight.

1573
01:23:07,545 --> 01:23:08,610
We have the naughty and nice list.

1574
01:23:08,645 --> 01:23:10,947
Lynn Kessler wants a power puff
girls play set.

1575
01:23:11,448 --> 01:23:13,416
Mark weber wants an electric
guitar.

1576
01:23:13,451 --> 01:23:13,715
Yes!

1577
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:17,586
Carolyn Reynolds wants a Suzy-
talks-a-lot.

1578
01:23:17,621 --> 01:23:18,688
Thanks, buddy.

1579
01:23:18,723 --> 01:23:19,720
Dirk Lawson wants

1580
01:23:19,755 --> 01:23:21,055
A day of pampering at burke
Williams spa.

1581
01:23:21,090 --> 01:23:25,220
Stan Tobias wants a power pumper
water pistol.

1582
01:23:26,028 --> 01:23:27,194
Must be another dirk Lawson.

1583
01:23:27,229 --> 01:23:29,648
Dave keckler wants some Nike
shocks.

1584
01:23:29,683 --> 01:23:31,842
Okay, uh, well, obviously we have

1585
01:23:31,877 --> 01:23:33,967
A new development in the story, uh,

1586
01:23:34,002 --> 01:23:36,605
A confirmation that Santa must
have been sighted

1587
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:38,440
Because we have his book right
here.

1588
01:23:38,475 --> 01:23:40,174
what's your name?

1589
01:23:40,209 --> 01:23:43,544
Uh, I'm charlotte den on, New York one.

1590
01:23:43,579 --> 01:23:46,104
"D," "D..."

1591
01:23:46,714 --> 01:23:49,116
Charlotte den on wants tiffany
engagement ring

1592
01:23:49,151 --> 01:23:51,519
And for her boyfriend to stop
dragging his feet

1593
01:23:51,554 --> 01:23:52,587
And commit already.

1594
01:23:57,525 --> 01:23:58,424
We've got power!

1595
01:23:58,459 --> 01:24:00,726
Charlotte...
charlotte?

1596
01:24:00,761 --> 01:24:02,597
Hey, turn the cameras back on!

1597
01:24:02,632 --> 01:24:03,764
Who told you to say that?

1598
01:24:03,799 --> 01:24:04,630
It's the real Santa.

1599
01:24:04,665 --> 01:24:06,766
We need to get these cameras
back on.

1600
01:24:06,801 --> 01:24:07,933
He needs our help!

1601
01:24:07,968 --> 01:24:10,303
Hey, Michael, are you okay?

1602
01:24:10,338 --> 01:24:10,969
Yeah, I'm fine.

1603
01:24:11,004 --> 01:24:14,274
But buddy, he's... he's in the
park with Santa,

1604
01:24:14,309 --> 01:24:15,474
The sleigh won't fly

1605
01:24:15,509 --> 01:24:17,511
'cause there's no Christmas
spirit.

1606
01:24:17,546 --> 01:24:20,381
Michael! Mom!

1607
01:24:20,416 --> 01:24:23,181
Michael! Ohh!

1608
01:24:23,216 --> 01:24:25,484
Are you okay? I'm fine.

1609
01:24:25,519 --> 01:24:28,522
The best way to spread
Christmas cheer

1610
01:24:28,557 --> 01:24:32,651
Is singing loud for all
to hear.

1611
01:24:36,996 --> 01:24:39,865
Buddy... better get going,
get in now!

1612
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:42,735
Santa, I'm not done with the
engine yet!

1613
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:44,001
Can't wait!

1614
01:24:44,036 --> 01:24:46,522
On, dasher, on, dancer...

1615
01:24:46,557 --> 01:24:49,008
I'm not done with the engine!

1616
01:24:52,845 --> 01:24:54,010
That's okay.

1617
01:24:54,045 --> 01:24:57,344
You get started, I'll catch up!

1618
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:04,772
You know, he wasn't lying.

1619
01:25:04,807 --> 01:25:07,325
Merry Christmas.

1620
01:25:12,163 --> 01:25:14,063
Santa, I can't...

1621
01:25:14,098 --> 01:25:16,701
Stop messing around and get in!

1622
01:25:16,736 --> 01:25:20,033
Aah!

1623
01:25:25,075 --> 01:25:27,177
Santa, why are they chasing us?!

1624
01:25:27,212 --> 01:25:29,279
I put the mon the naughty list,

1625
01:25:29,314 --> 01:25:31,713
And they never forgave me.

1626
01:25:37,087 --> 01:25:40,907
You better watch out,
you better not cry

1627
01:25:40,942 --> 01:25:44,727
You better not pout,
I'm telling you why

1628
01:25:44,762 --> 01:25:49,665
Santa Clausis coming' to town

1629
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:54,569
Yaah, yaah, yaah!

1630
01:25:55,638 --> 01:25:57,672
Up, up, pull up!

1631
01:25:57,707 --> 01:26:02,044
Buddy! We need power, we're
gonna crash!

1632
01:26:02,079 --> 01:26:06,149
He's making a list,
Checking it twice

1633
01:26:06,184 --> 01:26:10,218
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

1634
01:26:10,253 --> 01:26:15,724
Santa clausis coming' to town

1635
01:26:15,759 --> 01:26:21,196
He sees you when you're sleeping

1636
01:26:21,231 --> 01:26:24,064
He knows when you're awake

1637
01:26:24,099 --> 01:26:27,902
He knows if you've been bad or good

1638
01:26:27,937 --> 01:26:30,637
So be good for goodness sake

1639
01:26:30,672 --> 01:26:35,008
Oh, you better watch out,
you better not cry

1640
01:26:35,043 --> 01:26:39,346
You better not pout, I'm telling
you why

1641
01:26:39,381 --> 01:26:45,410
Santa Clausis coming to town

1642
01:26:51,759 --> 01:26:52,791
Aah!

1643
01:26:52,826 --> 01:26:55,396
You can do it!
Come on, dancer.

1644
01:26:55,431 --> 01:26:57,397
That's my boy.

1645
01:26:57,432 --> 01:26:59,449
Pull, cupid! Aah!

1646
01:26:59,484 --> 01:27:01,432
Pull, dasher!

1647
01:27:01,467 --> 01:27:05,638
I'm getting too old for this job.

1648
01:27:05,673 --> 01:27:07,162
Now!

1649
01:27:20,452 --> 01:27:22,154
The engine's gone!

1650
01:27:22,189 --> 01:27:23,388
We're toast!

1651
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,194
Well, still no sign of Santa,

1652
01:27:31,229 --> 01:27:33,298
But some spontaneous Christmas
caroling

1653
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:34,197
Has broken out

1654
01:27:34,232 --> 01:27:36,268
Right herein front of central
park.

1655
01:27:36,303 --> 01:27:37,301
Let's have a listen in.

1656
01:27:37,336 --> 01:27:39,171
He sees you when you're sleeping

1657
01:27:39,206 --> 01:27:42,673
He knows if you're awake

1658
01:27:42,708 --> 01:27:46,677
He knows if you've been bad or
good

1659
01:27:46,712 --> 01:27:50,481
So be good for goodness sake

1660
01:27:50,516 --> 01:27:50,913
Hey!

1661
01:27:50,948 --> 01:27:54,718
You better watch out, you better
not cry

1662
01:27:54,753 --> 01:27:58,489
You better not pout, I'm telling
you why

1663
01:27:58,524 --> 01:27:58,854
Come on!

1664
01:27:58,889 --> 01:28:03,174
Santa claus is coming' to town

1665
01:28:03,209 --> 01:28:07,459
Just a little more!

1666
01:28:12,502 --> 01:28:13,702
Hal-yah!

1667
01:28:13,737 --> 01:28:16,373
He knows when you're awake

1668
01:28:16,408 --> 01:28:17,672
He knows if you've

1669
01:28:17,707 --> 01:28:20,243
Wait... you're not singing.

1670
01:28:20,278 --> 01:28:21,242
Yes, I am.

1671
01:28:21,277 --> 01:28:24,481
No, you're not. You're just moving
your lips.

1672
01:28:24,516 --> 01:28:26,314
Santa!

1673
01:28:26,349 --> 01:28:28,952
Michael, please, what's the big deal?

1674
01:28:28,987 --> 01:28:29,718
Dad.

1675
01:28:29,753 --> 01:28:30,719
I'm telling you why

1676
01:28:30,754 --> 01:28:36,521
Santa clausis coming to town

1677
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:46,867
Oh! Ha ha ha!

1678
01:28:46,902 --> 01:28:49,037
Now, my beauties!

1679
01:28:56,278 --> 01:28:57,377
Bye-bye.

1680
01:28:57,412 --> 01:28:58,778
Just like the old days!

1681
01:28:58,813 --> 01:29:01,848
Charlotte? Charlotte?

1682
01:29:01,883 --> 01:29:04,585
Well, I guess we'll never know for
sure

1683
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:06,587
What happened this Christmas Eve?

1684
01:29:06,622 --> 01:29:07,920
In central park.

1685
01:29:07,955 --> 01:29:14,095
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!

1686
01:29:14,130 --> 01:29:16,996
Ho ho ho!

1687
01:29:17,031 --> 01:29:19,932
And so, with a little help,

1688
01:29:19,967 --> 01:29:21,900
Buddy managed to save Christmas.

1689
01:29:21,935 --> 01:29:24,838
And his spirit saved a lot of other
People, too.

1690
01:29:24,873 --> 01:29:31,611
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1691
01:29:31,646 --> 01:29:37,949
And never brought to mind

1692
01:29:37,984 --> 01:29:45,257
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1693
01:29:45,292 --> 01:29:48,828
Walter started his own independent
publishing company.

1694
01:29:48,863 --> 01:29:51,581
His first book was written by a
brand new,

1695
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:54,300
Critically acclaimed children's
author.

1696
01:29:54,335 --> 01:29:56,102
The book was elf...

1697
01:29:56,137 --> 01:29:57,835
A, uh, fictional story

1698
01:29:57,870 --> 01:29:59,972
About an adopted elf named buddy

1699
01:30:00,007 --> 01:30:02,041
Who was raised in the North Pole?

1700
01:30:02,076 --> 01:30:04,076
Went to New York, ate spaghetti,

1701
01:30:04,111 --> 01:30:06,462
Worked in a shiny mailroom,

1702
01:30:06,497 --> 01:30:08,779
And eventually saved Christmas.

1703
01:30:08,814 --> 01:30:11,583
"First, I traveled through the
seven levels

1704
01:30:11,618 --> 01:30:13,883
"Of the candy cane forest,

1705
01:30:13,918 --> 01:30:18,488
"Past the sea of twirly-swirly
gumdrops,

1706
01:30:18,523 --> 01:30:23,361
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel."

1707
01:30:23,396 --> 01:30:25,595
And as for me, I can't complain.

1708
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:28,032
Buddy comes up to visit from time
to time.

1709
01:30:28,067 --> 01:30:31,603
In the meadow we can build a
snowman

1710
01:30:31,638 --> 01:30:35,103
And pretend that he is parson
brown

1711
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:38,342
Oh, thank you, Jovie. That's very
sweet of you.

1712
01:30:38,377 --> 01:30:39,842
You're welcome, papa.

1713
01:30:39,877 --> 01:30:43,881
But you can do the job when
you're in town

1714
01:30:43,916 --> 01:30:45,380
Hey, Suzie.

1715
01:30:45,415 --> 01:30:46,315
Come here, little one.

1716
01:30:46,350 --> 01:30:48,886
When it snows, ain't it
thrilling?

1717
01:30:48,921 --> 01:30:50,352
Papa wants to see you.

1718
01:30:50,387 --> 01:30:53,991
Though your nose get a
little chilling

1719
01:30:54,026 --> 01:30:54,356
Buddy...

1720
01:30:54,391 --> 01:30:56,658
We'll frolic and play buddy...
buddy...

1721
01:30:56,693 --> 01:31:02,961
The Eskimo way, walking in a
winter wonderland

1722
01:31:20,216 --> 01:31:24,436
In the meadow we can build a
snowman

1723
01:31:24,471 --> 01:31:28,622
And pretend that he is parson
brown

1724
01:31:28,657 --> 01:31:33,061
He'll say, are you married,
we'll say no, man

1725
01:31:33,096 --> 01:31:37,465
But you can do the job when you
in town, brother

1726
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:42,070
Later on, we'll conspire

1727
01:31:42,105 --> 01:31:46,606
As we dream by the fire

1728
01:31:46,641 --> 01:31:51,078
To face unafraid the plans
That we made

1729
01:31:51,113 --> 01:31:55,411
Walking in a winter wonderland

1730
01:31:55,446 --> 01:31:59,710
Walking in a winter wonderland

1731
01:32:11,165 --> 01:32:12,597
I really can't stay

1732
01:32:12,632 --> 01:32:17,136
But, baby, it's cold outside

1733
01:32:17,171 --> 01:32:18,202
I've got to go 'way

1734
01:32:18,237 --> 01:32:21,975
But, baby, it's cold outside

1735
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:24,242
This evening has been

1736
01:32:24,277 --> 01:32:27,013
Been hoping that you'd drop in

1737
01:32:27,048 --> 01:32:28,413
So very nice

1738
01:32:28,448 --> 01:32:33,653
I'll hold your hands, they're
just like ice

1739
01:32:33,688 --> 01:32:36,205
My mother will start to worry

1740
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:38,689
Beautiful, what's your hurry?

1741
01:32:38,724 --> 01:32:42,127
And father will be pacing the floor

1742
01:32:42,162 --> 01:32:44,663
Listen to that fireplace roar

1743
01:32:44,698 --> 01:32:47,116
So, really, I'd better scurry

1744
01:32:47,151 --> 01:32:49,499
Beautiful, please don't hurry

1745
01:32:49,534 --> 01:32:52,670
Well, maybe just a half a drink more

1746
01:32:52,705 --> 01:32:55,807
Put some records on while I pour

1747
01:32:55,842 --> 01:32:58,193
The neighbors might think

1748
01:32:58,228 --> 01:33:00,253
Baby, it's bad out there

1749
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:03,386
Say, what's in this drink?

1750
01:33:03,421 --> 01:33:06,484
No cabs to be had out there

1751
01:33:06,519 --> 01:33:08,184
I wish I knew how

1752
01:33:08,219 --> 01:33:10,588
Your eyes are like starlight now

1753
01:33:10,623 --> 01:33:12,521
To break the spell

1754
01:33:12,556 --> 01:33:17,595
I'll take your hat, your hair
looks swell

1755
01:33:17,630 --> 01:33:20,531
I ought to say no, no, no, sir

1756
01:33:20,566 --> 01:33:22,632
Mind if I move in closer?

1757
01:33:22,667 --> 01:33:25,852
At least I'm gonna say that I
tried

1758
01:33:25,887 --> 01:33:29,039
What's the sense of hurting
my pride?

1759
01:33:29,074 --> 01:33:30,941
I really can't stay

1760
01:33:30,976 --> 01:33:32,774
Baby, don't hold out

1761
01:33:32,809 --> 01:33:39,806
Ah, but it's cold outside

1762
01:33:48,091 --> 01:33:49,323
I simply must go

1763
01:33:49,358 --> 01:33:53,328
But, baby, it's cold outside

1764
01:33:53,363 --> 01:33:55,262
The answer is no

1765
01:33:55,297 --> 01:33:58,567
But, baby, it's cold outside

1766
01:33:58,602 --> 01:34:00,334
This welcome has been

1767
01:34:00,369 --> 01:34:03,072
I'm lucky that you dropped in

1768
01:34:03,107 --> 01:34:05,005
So nice and warm

1769
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:10,079
Look out the window at that
storm

1770
01:34:10,114 --> 01:34:12,731
My sister will be suspicious

1771
01:34:12,766 --> 01:34:15,314
Gosh, your lips look delicious

1772
01:34:15,349 --> 01:34:18,586
My brother will be there at
the door

1773
01:34:18,621 --> 01:34:20,787
Waves upon tropical shore

1774
01:34:20,822 --> 01:34:23,558
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious

1775
01:34:23,593 --> 01:34:26,259
Oh, your lips look delicious

1776
01:34:26,294 --> 01:34:28,696
Well, maybe just a cigarette more

1777
01:34:28,731 --> 01:34:32,233
Never such a pleasure before

1778
01:34:32,268 --> 01:34:34,033
I've got to get home

1779
01:34:34,068 --> 01:34:36,804
But, baby, you'll freeze out there

1780
01:34:36,839 --> 01:34:38,603
Say, lend me your comb

1781
01:34:38,638 --> 01:34:42,642
It's up to your knees out there

1782
01:34:42,677 --> 01:34:44,710
You've really been grand

1783
01:34:44,745 --> 01:34:46,780
I thrill when you touch my hand

1784
01:34:46,815 --> 01:34:48,880
But don't you see

1785
01:34:48,915 --> 01:34:52,652
How can you do this thing to me?

1786
01:34:52,687 --> 01:34:56,389
There's bound to be talk tomorrow

1787
01:34:56,424 --> 01:34:59,558
Think of my lifelong sorrow

1788
01:34:59,593 --> 01:35:02,328
At least there will be plenty
implied

1789
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:05,331
If you caught pneumonia and died

1790
01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:06,897
I really can't stay

1791
01:35:06,932 --> 01:35:09,401
Get rid of that hold out

1792
01:35:09,436 --> 01:35:13,405
Ah, but it's cold

1793
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:19,139
Outside

1794
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,055
