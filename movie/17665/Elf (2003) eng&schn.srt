00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,120
各位好

3
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,200
各位前来大概是

4
00:00:29,027 --> 00:00:29,593
Oh, hello.

5
00:00:29,628 --> 00:00:31,530
You're, uh, you're probably here

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,790
是为了听故事

7
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:33,649
About the, uh, the story.

8
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,230
精灵就喜欢讲故事

9
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:35,699
Elves love to tell stories.

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,300
精灵这点我看大家还不知道吧

11
00:00:35,734 --> 00:00:38,537
I-I'll bet you didn't know that
about elves.

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,600
大概…关于精灵方面

13
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,856
There's, uh, probably a lot of things

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,630
还有许多…大家毫无所知

15
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:43,105
You... you didn't know about elves.

16
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:46,340
另外一点有趣的是… 身为精灵

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,810
Another... another interesting
uh, elf ism

18
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:51,740
精灵只有三行活儿可干

19
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:53,250
Uh, there are only three jobs available
to an elf.

20
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,310
其一，夜晚… 趁着老工匠…

21
00:00:53,285 --> 00:00:54,902
The first is making shoes at night

22
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,100
沉沉入睡

23
00:00:54,937 --> 00:00:56,520
While, you know, while the old...

24
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,680
去做鞋子

25
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:58,154
The old cobbler sleeps.

26
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,720
大懒虫 你连木底鞋都造不出

27
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:01,225
Lazy bum. Couldn't even make a clog.

28
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,350
或者是在树身内

29
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,860
You can bake cookies

30
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,190
烘饼干

31
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,290
不过想必阁下也想象得出 干燥季节

32
00:01:02,895 --> 00:01:03,659
In a tree.

33
00:01:03,694 --> 00:01:06,796
As you can imagine, it's, uh, dangerous
having an oven

34
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,760
在橡树树身里面弄个 烤炉可是多危险的事

35
00:01:06,831 --> 00:01:09,265
In an oak tree during the dry season.

36
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,530
我要做鞋！

37
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,999
I wanna make shoes!

38
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,600
但第三行…有人称之为

39
00:01:11,034 --> 00:01:13,570
But the third job... uh, some call
it, uh,

40
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,330
“做秀” 也有人称之“大舞会”

41
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:15,804
"The show," or... or "the big dance,"

42
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,700
每个精灵都渴望加入这行

43
00:01:15,839 --> 00:01:19,959
It's the profession that every elf
aspires to,

44
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,570
而这行的职责 就是在圣诞老人车间造玩具了

45
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:24,080
And that is to build toys in
Santa's workshop.

46
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,800
离圣诞还有两周！

47
00:01:24,115 --> 00:01:26,310
Only two weeks left till Christmas!

48
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,310
这一行也只有精灵能上马

49
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,818
I-It's a job only an elf can do.

50
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,180
我们…我们手指灵巧

51
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,120
天生欢快，头脑热心

52
00:01:29,853 --> 00:01:31,237
Our... our nimble fingers,

53
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,250
制造玩具那对我们 是再适当不过

54
00:01:31,272 --> 00:01:33,014
Natural cheer and active minds

55
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:34,722
Are perfect for toy-building.

56
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,220
他们… 还试过找巨魔和侏儒上厂开工

57
00:01:34,757 --> 00:01:37,726
They... they tried using gnomes
and trolls,

58
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,900
但侏儒嗜酒…

59
00:01:37,761 --> 00:01:40,593
But the gnomes drank too much...

60
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,420
巨魔又没有上厕所的习惯

61
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:44,929
...and the trolls weren't toilet
trained.

62
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:49,700
从无人类曾… 踏足圣诞老人车间

63
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:50,572
No human being has ever set... set
foot in Santa's workshop.

64
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,870
直到30年前

65
00:01:50,607 --> 00:01:53,375
Uh, that is until about 30 years ago,

66
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,910
各位大概也猜到了

67
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,360
And, as you may have guessed,

68
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,810
我们的故事正是从此时而始

69
00:01:56,395 --> 00:01:59,312
That's where our story begins.

70
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,910
领衔主演:威尔.法瑞尔

71
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,910

00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,920

编剧:戴维.伯伦汉姆

导演:乔.费儒

75
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,480
困了吗？

76
00:03:47,784 --> 00:03:49,979
Are you sleepy?

77
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,290
到了到了

78
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,860
来，躺得舒舒服服的

79
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:51,753
Here we are.

80
00:03:51,788 --> 00:03:56,359
We're just going to make you feel
so comfortable.

81
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,700
好咧

82
00:03:56,394 --> 00:03:58,428
Here we are.

83
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,960
来

84
00:03:58,463 --> 00:04:00,428
There you are.

85
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,200
到时候睡觉了哦

86
00:04:00,463 --> 00:04:03,664
It's time to go to sleep.

87
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,730
或许到了下个圣诞 你就会有个家庭了

88
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:07,226
Maybe by next Christmas you'll
Have a home.

89
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,000
圣诞快乐，我的天使

90
00:04:13,543 --> 00:04:17,502
Merry Christmas, my ángel.

91
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,820
好了，各位

92
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:28,279
All right, all right.

93
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,310
我们今年再度非常成功

94
00:05:28,314 --> 00:05:31,818
We've had another very successful
year.

95
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,900
大家一番努力之后

96
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:36,204
So, after all that hard work,

97
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,290
又要为下一年圣诞

98
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:38,790
It's time to start preparations

99
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,920
开始准备咯！

100
00:05:38,825 --> 00:05:40,425
For next Christmas!

101
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,470
什么鬼东西？

102
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:53,965
What in the name of Sam hill
Is that?

103
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,350
婴儿…

104
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:02,842
A baby...

105
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,360
“小密友（读音:巴迪）尿片”

106
00:06:05,483 --> 00:06:07,817
"little buddy diapers."

107
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,490
他叫巴迪，一定是

108
00:06:07,852 --> 00:06:09,952
His name is buddy. He must've...

109
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,860
在孤儿院 爬进去你的袋子里面的

110
00:06:09,987 --> 00:06:12,356
Snuck into your sack at the
orphanage.

111
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,360
我们该怎办？

112
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,530
于是 圣诞老人必须作出决定了

113
00:06:12,391 --> 00:06:12,822
What do we do?

114
00:06:12,857 --> 00:06:15,992
So, Santa had a
Decision to make,

115
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,630
幸运的是 圣诞老人对小宝宝

116
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:18,129
And fortunately, when it
Comes to babies,

117
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,970
心肠很软

118
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,170
于是，巴迪从此就跟了个 老精灵一起生活

119
00:06:18,164 --> 00:06:19,428
Santa's a... a pushover.

120
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,665
So, buddy stayed with, uh
An older elf

121
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,140
这老精灵一直想要个孩子

122
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,670
但由于在玩具制造业中 一番全心全意，他

123
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,597
Who had always wanted a child?

124
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,168
But had been so committed to
Building toys, he...

125
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:28,510
他居然遗漏了定居生活一事

126
00:06:25,203 --> 00:06:30,006
He, well, had forgotten to
Settle down.

127
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,150
圣诞老人

128
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,380
对，没错，就是我… 养大的巴迪

129
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:30,605
Santa.

130
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,877
Yes, yes, I... I raised buddy.

131
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,650
我是他的养父

132
00:06:33,912 --> 00:06:36,111
I was his adopted father.

133
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,390
尽管巴迪的生长速度 快于我们一倍

134
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,846
Though buddy grew twice as fast,

135
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:40,590
不过…他和其他孩子 看来也还是没有什么不同

136
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:42,085
He... he wasn't any different from
the other children.

137
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,690
巴迪，别太快了

138
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,755
Chuckles not too fast, buddy.

139
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,900
我意思是…也不确然

140
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,354
I mean, not... not really.

141
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,670
在我们学习如何使用…

142
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:49,274
Before we learn how to build
The latest

143
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,670
极效图形芯片处理器 打造最新式样前

144
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,602
In extreme graphic chipset
Processors,

145
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,400
我们先朗读一遍“精灵法则”

146
00:06:51,637 --> 00:06:53,896
Let's recite the
"Code of the elves,"

147
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,440
好不好？

148
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,100
第一条

149
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:54,764
Shall we?

150
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,700
“视每天如圣诞”

151
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:55,562
Number one.

152
00:06:55,597 --> 00:06:58,567
"Treat every day like Christmas."

153
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:57,880
第二条

154
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,880
“给每个人在‘好名单‘上 留一席之地”

155
00:06:58,602 --> 00:06:59,333
Number two.

156
00:06:59,368 --> 00:07:03,372
"There's room for everyone on the
Nice list."

157
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,100
第三条

158
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,380
“圣诞的欢快要传扬 最好的方法”

159
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:04,471
Number three.

160
00:07:04,506 --> 00:07:07,876
"The best way to spread Christmas
Cheer

161
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,220
“便是大声传唱，让人人听见”

162
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:11,709
Is singing loud for all to hear."

163
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,390
等巴迪足年后一天

164
00:07:11,946 --> 00:07:14,582
And one day, when buddy was
old enough,

165
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,730
我开始给他亲身传授本事

166
00:07:14,617 --> 00:07:16,785
I made him my own personal
apprentice.

167
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,460
我以前还没来过这间房

168
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,871
I've never been in this room
before.

169
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,430
是时候该让你学学…

170
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,922
Well, I think it's time you start

171
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,400
修补了

172
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:22,890
Your tinker training.

173
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,470
圣诞老人的雪橇

174
00:07:23,558 --> 00:07:26,926
Santa's sleigh.

175
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,100
你要帮我一起弄它上天

176
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:29,589
You're gonna help me make it fly.

177
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,210
不是魔法驯鹿让雪橇 扶摇直上的吗？

178
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,701
I thought the magical reindeer made
The sleighs fly.

179
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,100
那驯鹿的魔法又是哪来的呢？

180
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:36,503
And where do the reindeer get
their magic from?

181
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,520
圣诞情绪啊，众所周知的嘛

182
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:41,007
Christmas spirit. Everybody
knows that.

183
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,650
有件事，尽管听来傻

184
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:43,093
Well, silly as it sounds,

185
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,650
可是确实，南方许多人

186
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:45,104
A lot of people down south

187
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,590
不信有圣诞老人

188
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:47,080
Don't believe in Santa Claus.

189
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,420
什么？！

190
00:07:47,115 --> 00:07:48,880
What?!

191
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,630
那他们会以为是谁 放玩具在树下的？

192
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:52,119
Well, who do they think puts all?
Their toys under the tree?

193
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,430
他们身边有股流言

194
00:07:52,154 --> 00:07:54,055
Well, there's a rumor floating around

195
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,470
这事是家长所为

196
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,956
That, uh, that the parents do it.

197
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,430
真是…真是荒唐可笑

198
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:57,889
That's... that's ridiculous.

199
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,440
哪有父母可能一夜 成就那么多事的

200
00:07:57,924 --> 00:08:00,926
I mean, parents couldn't do that
all in one night.

201
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,570
那给圣诞老人吃的饼干呢？

202
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,100
不是也说是家长吃了吧？

203
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:02,026
What about Santa's cookies?

204
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:04,497
I suppose parents eat them, too?

205
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,110
对，我…我知道

206
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,580
年复一年，越来越少人

207
00:08:04,532 --> 00:08:05,563
Yeah, I, uh, I... I know,

208
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,067
Uh, and every earless and less
People

209
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,280
相信有圣诞老人

210
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,710
我们确实面临着真正的 能量危机

211
00:08:08,102 --> 00:08:08,733
Believe in Santa Claus.

212
00:08:08,768 --> 00:08:12,204
I mean, we have a real energy
crisis on our hands.

213
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,150
你看看 这里程表转了有多少

214
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:16,642
I mean, just see how low the, uh
Claus meter is.

215
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,220
太令人震惊了

216
00:08:16,677 --> 00:08:18,444
That's shocking.

217
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,720
所以我才在六十年代

218
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,177
That's why I came up

219
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,120
打造出了这小可爱

220
00:08:20,212 --> 00:08:22,615
With this little beauty in the '60s.

221
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,000
什么…来的？

222
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,500
克林格3000型…

223
00:08:27,218 --> 00:08:28,451
WH-what is it?

224
00:08:28,486 --> 00:08:29,953
It's a cringle 3000...

225
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,170
有500驯鹿力的 喷气发动机引擎

226
00:08:29,988 --> 00:08:33,658
A 500-reindeer power jet turbine
engine.

227
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,700
没了这东西，圣诞老人雪橇

228
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:35,158
Without it, the sleigh couldn't

229
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,640
连地面数英尺的距离 都飞不上

230
00:08:35,193 --> 00:08:39,129
Get more than, uh, a few feet off
the ground.

231
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,610
似乎是热电偶

232
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,610
发生了短路

233
00:08:40,999 --> 00:08:42,550
Well, it looks like we got

234
00:08:42,585 --> 00:08:44,594
A short in the thermo coupler.

235
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,120
要不要帮我一把？

236
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:46,604
You wanna give mea hand with that?

237
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,620
你要我帮忙？

238
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,990
虽然说巴迪也被

239
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,070
You want me to help?

240
00:08:48,105 --> 00:08:50,474
As much as, uh, buddy was accepted

241
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,560
家人和朋友接受

242
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:52,643
By his family and friends,

243
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,290
但作为精灵世界中的人类

244
00:08:52,678 --> 00:08:54,743
There were a few drawbacks

245
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:57,600
他也遇到了少许障碍

246
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:58,549
To being, uh, a human in, uh
an elf's world.

247
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,240
嘿，明明

248
00:09:19,635 --> 00:09:21,737
Hey, Ming Ming.

249
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,620
今天的配额我可能会 完成得较少

250
00:09:21,772 --> 00:09:22,703
Um...

251
00:09:22,738 --> 00:09:27,109
I'm gonna be a little bit short
on today's quota.

252
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,690
没事，巴迪

253
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,230
不过你一共完成了多少件

254
00:09:27,144 --> 00:09:28,142
It's all right, buddy.

255
00:09:28,177 --> 00:09:29,712
Just how many etch-a-sketches

256
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,230
神奇画板呢？

257
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:32,983
Did you get finished?

258
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,730
说啊，巴迪，多少件？

259
00:09:33,018 --> 00:09:36,218
Come on, buddy. How many?

260
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:39,300
我做了…85件

261
00:09:36,253 --> 00:09:40,518
I made, uh... 85.

262
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,600
85件？

263
00:09:46,027 --> 00:09:48,086
Eighty-five?

264
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,140
你可距离和第一名间

265
00:09:48,763 --> 00:09:50,628
That puts you...

266
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,120
足足差了有915件

267
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,680
真是糟

268
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,566
915 off the pace.

269
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:54,134
Ooh... that's bad.

270
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,800
你何不直说？

271
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:55,535
Why don't you just say it?

272
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,350
我是世上最糟糕的玩具工人

273
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,089
I'm the worst toy maker in
the world.

274
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,120
我头脑软绵绵，十足大笨蛋

275
00:09:58,124 --> 00:10:00,608
I'm a cotton-headed ninny-muggins.

276
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,560
不，巴迪，你并非什么 头脑软绵绵，十足大笨蛋

277
00:10:01,175 --> 00:10:04,044
No, buddy, you're not cotton-
headed ninny-muggins.

278
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,660
我们只是各自有不同的天赋

279
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,147
We all just have different talents
That's all.

280
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,600
但似乎其他所有人

281
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,700
都有同样的一种天赋 除我以外

282
00:10:07,182 --> 00:10:08,047
Seems like everyone else

283
00:10:08,082 --> 00:10:09,515
Have the same talents
except for me.

284
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,870
你…你有很多才能啊

285
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,353
You... you have, you have lots of
Talents, uh...

286
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,410
实际上，特别的才能有

287
00:10:12,388 --> 00:10:15,890
Special talents in fact, like
Um, uh...

288
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,210
特别才能？

289
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,910
你会更换烟雾侦测器里的电池

290
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:16,655
Special talents?

291
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,393
You changed the batteries in the
smoke detector.

292
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,710
没错就是…令人叹服的

293
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,910
六个月后，你又要去检查了

294
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:20,159
You sure did... aaa's.

295
00:10:20,194 --> 00:10:23,397
And in six months, you'll have
to check 'em again...

296
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,680
对不对？

297
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,380
还有 你是精灵唱诗班唯一的男中音

298
00:10:23,432 --> 00:10:24,129
Won't he?

299
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:26,866
And you're the only baritone in
the elf choir.

300
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,620
让我们降低了一整个八度

301
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:29,102
You bring us down whole octave.

302
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,620
不错哦

303
00:10:29,137 --> 00:10:30,437
In a good way.

304
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,250
如你所见，巴迪

305
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,420
你并非棉花头，大笨蛋

306
00:10:30,472 --> 00:10:31,703
See, buddy?

307
00:10:31,738 --> 00:10:33,907
You're not a cotton-headed ninny-
muggings.

308
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,260
你只是…比较特别

309
00:10:33,942 --> 00:10:37,741
You're just... special.

310
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:42,230
于是，巴迪被派去了…干特别

311
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:43,716
And so, buddy was sent where the...
The special elves work.

312
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,240
锋锋…

313
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,470
有件事想求求你 能不能帮帮我

314
00:11:21,185 --> 00:11:21,684
Hey, foom foom...

315
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:24,004
I hate to do this to you, but you
Think you could

316
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,810
恢复一下 神奇画板制作的进度？

317
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:26,290
Help me pick up the slack on those
etch-a-sketches?

318
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,940
-没问题   -实在多谢

319
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:28,426
No problem. I appreciate it.

320
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,640
巴迪让我难为极了

321
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,250
我已经让蓝蓝 和楚楚干双倍的活儿了

322
00:11:28,461 --> 00:11:29,091
Buddy is killing me.

323
00:11:29,126 --> 00:11:32,730
I already got lum lum and choochoo pulling' doubles.

324
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,420
昨日你那“特殊才能”的话儿

325
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,320
脑筋动得还真挺快的

326
00:11:32,765 --> 00:11:34,282
That was quick thinking yesterday

327
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:35,725
With that ¡°special talents¡± thing.

328
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,650
我真为这孩子感到难过

329
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,850
只希望他别太醒目了

330
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,048
I feel bad for the guy.

331
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:40,460
他如果到现在还搞不明白 自己是人类

332
00:11:37,082 --> 00:11:38,300
I just hope he doesn't get wise.

333
00:11:38,335 --> 00:11:41,938
Well, if he hasn't figured out
He's a human by now,

334
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,820
那我想他以后也不会了

335
00:11:41,973 --> 00:11:44,304
I don't think he ever will.

336
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,800
他如果到现在还搞不明白 自己是人类

337
00:11:47,944 --> 00:11:50,625
If he hasn't figured
Out he's a human

338
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,830
那我想他以后也不会了

339
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,306
By now, I don't think he ever will.

340
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,740
是不是太小了

341
00:11:54,317 --> 00:11:57,218
I think they're too small.

342
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,670
你只是…比较特别

343
00:11:58,855 --> 00:12:03,154
You're just... special.

344
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,470
巴迪，你气色似乎不好

345
00:12:20,743 --> 00:12:22,945
You don't look so good, buddy.

346
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,000
没事吧？

347
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,490
我没事，只需要喝杯水

348
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,444
Are you okay?

349
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:26,981
I'll be okay, I just need a glass
of water.

350
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,730
巴迪…

351
00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:32,208
Buddy...

352
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,260
巴迪，你没事吧？

353
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:54,741
Buddy, are you okay?

354
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,300
对不起，爸爸

355
00:12:54,776 --> 00:12:56,742
I'm sorry, papa.

356
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,730
我只想独处一会

357
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,177
I just need some alone time.

358
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,300
巴迪…我看我们得谈谈

359
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,782
Buddy, I... I think we... we have
to talk.

360
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,570
巴迪，或许有些事情

361
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:04,936
Buddy, uh, I think there's something

362
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,580
我是该告诉你了

363
00:13:04,971 --> 00:13:08,020
I... I probably should tell you.

364
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,500
也或许你在很早很早之前

365
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:11,525
You probably should have found
out a long...

366
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,250
便已知晓

367
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,280
于是我便告知了巴迪他父亲

368
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,691
A long time ago.

369
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:15,761
I then proceeded to tell buddy of
how his father

370
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,920
如何于年少时与一位

371
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,698
Had fallen in love when he was
very young

372
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,120
美丽的少女 苏珊.威尔斯堕入爱河

373
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:21,600
With a beautiful girl named
Susan wells,

374
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,290
巴迪又是如何出生

375
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,790
后来被其母亲送往领养

376
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:22,733
And how buddy was born

377
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,271
And put up for adoption by
his mother,

378
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,760
而后她去死

379
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:28,240
And how she had later passed away.

380
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,800
还…跟他说了他父亲

381
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,300
还不知道巴迪诞生一事

382
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:29,240
I... I told him his father

383
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,777
Had never even known that
Buddy was born,

384
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,100
而最重要的

385
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,400
我跟他说了其父

386
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:32,543
And most importantly,

387
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,478
I told him where his father was...

388
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,110
在一处叫“纽约城”的 魔幻土地

389
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:38,583
Uh, in a magical land called
new York City.

390
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,400
我父亲在那工作？

391
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,950
My dad works there?

392
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,810
帝国大厦

393
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:43,282
Empire state building.

394
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,420
巴迪，要拿些雪果不？

395
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:49,894
Hey, buddy, wanna pick some
snow berries?

396
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,290
暂时不要了，北极海雀

397
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,761
Not now, arctic puffin.

398
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,430
-你好，巴迪   -嗨，里昂

399
00:13:53,998 --> 00:13:56,500
Hello, buddy. Oh... hi, Leon.

400
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,530
为何闷闷不乐，伙计？

401
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,421
Why the long face, partner?

402
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:00,830
似乎…我并非是精灵

403
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:01,715
It seems I'm... I'm not an elf.

404
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,500
你当然不是，你可有6尺3寸

405
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,363
'Course you're not. You're 6'3"

406
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,500
15岁时候还长胡子了

407
00:14:04,398 --> 00:14:06,977
And had a beard since you were 15.

408
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,640
爸爸说我有个生父

409
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,810
他住在遥远的一个魔幻之地

410
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,077
Papa says my real father

411
00:14:08,112 --> 00:14:11,281
Lives in a magical place far away.

412
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,110
我不知如何是好

413
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,910
起码你还有个爹爹

414
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:12,349
I don't know what to do.

415
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:16,110
而我只是某天被堆起来 留在冰天雪地的雪人

416
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,348
At least you have a daddy.

417
00:14:13,383 --> 00:14:17,588
I was just rolled up one day and
left out here in the cold.

418
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,820
但问题是 我根本从未离开过北极

419
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,290
But the thing is, I've never even left
the North Pole.

420
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,350
巴迪 在我还是年少的一片积云时

421
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:22,676
Buddy, I've been around the world
Many times

422
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,550
我曾周游世界多回

423
00:14:22,711 --> 00:14:24,993
When I was a young cumulus
nimbus cloud.

424
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,420
这地方十分美妙 充满着令人惊奇的生物

425
00:14:25,028 --> 00:14:28,898
It's a wonderful place, filled with
Wondrous creatures...

426
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:27,960
除狗以外

427
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,830
顺带一提，别吃黄雪水

428
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:29,397
Except dogs.

429
00:14:29,432 --> 00:14:32,301
Oh, by the way, don't eat the
yellow snow.

430
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,460
我知道这个

431
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,530
我想说的是 这或许是个绝佳的黄金机会

432
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:32,900
Oh, I know that.

433
00:14:32,935 --> 00:14:37,006
All I'm say in' is, this might be
The golden opportunity

434
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,330
让你发现自己确实的身份呢

435
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,804
To find out whom you really are.

436
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,510
听说你要开展

437
00:14:42,678 --> 00:14:44,946
So, I hear you're going

438
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:46,440
前往大城市的一个小旅程

439
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:47,917
On a little journey to
the big city.

440
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,640
对

441
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,870
我有点紧张

442
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:49,083
Yup. Ahh.

443
00:14:49,118 --> 00:14:50,353
I'm kind a nervous.

444
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,480
里昂说纽约是个 完全不同的地方

445
00:14:50,987 --> 00:14:52,954
Leon says New York is pretty
different.

446
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,550
别理会里昂

447
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:56,520
他哪都没去过 因为他连脚丫子都没有

448
00:14:52,989 --> 00:14:53,987
Oh, don't pay attention to Leon.

449
00:14:54,022 --> 00:14:57,993
He's never been anywhere.
He doesn't have any feet.

450
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,160
我倒去过纽约成百上千回

451
00:14:58,028 --> 00:15:00,629
I've been to New York thousands
of times.

452
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,560
真的吗？

453
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,160
那地方什么样的？

454
00:15:00,664 --> 00:15:01,647
Really?

455
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,990
有些事你必须先了解

456
00:15:01,682 --> 00:15:02,596
What's it like?

457
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:05,467
Well, there are some things you
should know.

458
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,430
首先，见到地上有口香糖

459
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:08,070
First off, you see gum on
The street,

460
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,170
千万别去动 那地方没有免费糖果

461
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:10,639
Leave it there. It's not
free candy.

462
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,400
第二

463
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,670
那里大概有30家雷氏批萨店

464
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:11,838
Oh. Second,

465
00:15:11,873 --> 00:15:14,425
There are, like, 30 ray's
pizzas.

466
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,510
都声称自己是原始正宗

467
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,977
They all claim to be the
Original,

468
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,170
但实际真正正宗那家 在11大街

469
00:15:17,012 --> 00:15:18,611
But the real one' son 11th.

470
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,510
见到有标语上书“西洋景”的

471
00:15:18,646 --> 00:15:21,248
And if you see a sign that
Says "peep show,"

472
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,380
那可不代表人家 是要让你于圣诞前

473
00:15:21,283 --> 00:15:23,851
That doesn't mean that
They're letting you

474
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,650
先看看有何礼物

475
00:15:23,886 --> 00:15:27,121
Look at presents before Christmas.

476
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,480
我迫不及待想见我父亲…

477
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,950
我们要去滑冰 然后…然后吃糖李子

478
00:15:27,156 --> 00:15:27,920
Can't wait to see my dad...

479
00:15:27,955 --> 00:15:31,425
We're gonna go ices skating and...
And eat sugar plums.

480
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,560
是吗？不过还有一件事

481
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,745
Yeah, that's the other thing

482
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,560
我要跟你说说

483
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,840
I wanted to talk to you about.

484
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,430
巴迪…

485
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,455
You know, buddy...

486
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,560
你爸爸…

487
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,000
Your father...

488
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,970
淘气名单上有他的名字

489
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:45,438
Well... he's on the naughty list.

490
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,460
不！！！

491
00:15:45,473 --> 00:15:48,930
No!

492
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,570
你要把书都索回？

493
00:15:49,876 --> 00:15:54,047
You're taking the books back?

494
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,910
我…我明白你来此的意图

495
00:15:55,048 --> 00:15:57,383
See, I... I see what you're trying
to do here.

496
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,650
是想让我觉得有点愧疚

497
00:15:57,418 --> 00:15:59,236
Y- You're trying to make me feel bad,

498
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,580
但…实际上，是你

499
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:01,054
When, in actuality, you're the one

500
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,650
没按时缴钱

501
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,590
可是孩子们都喜欢那些书

502
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:02,086
That missed the payments.

503
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:06,058
But the children love the books.

504
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,460
我知道

505
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,720
可是 我也主持过焦点团体座谈

506
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:06,890
I know that, uh...

507
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:09,194
You know, I'm the one that ran
The focus groups,

508
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,230
不过我还是乐于听到这点

509
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:10,661
But I like hearing that.

510
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,600
听好了 有些人在人生中迷失了方向

511
00:16:10,696 --> 00:16:14,066
Listen, some people, they just
Lose sight

512
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,430
分不清生活中何者为重

513
00:16:14,101 --> 00:16:15,866
Of what's important in life.

514
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:20,240
但这并不意味着他们 永远再不能找到正路了

515
00:16:15,901 --> 00:16:21,707
That doesn't mean they can't find
their way again, huh?

516
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,100
也许他们只是需要

517
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,730
那么一点点圣诞情绪

518
00:16:21,742 --> 00:16:22,539
Maybe all they need

519
00:16:22,574 --> 00:16:25,210
Is just a little Christmas spirit.

520
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,250
这我…我擅长啊

521
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,715
Well, uh, I... I'm good at that.

522
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,740
我知道

523
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,206
I know you are.

524
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,500
我…

525
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:46,929
And I'll...

526
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,230
我好永远…

527
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,260
在此等候着你回来

528
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:47,663
I'll always, uh,

529
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:50,724
I'll always be here for you.

530
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,510
你…

531
00:16:57,173 --> 00:16:59,604
Now, uh...

532
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,570
出发吧

533
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,035
Go... uh, get.

534
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,290
再见，各位

535
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,560
再见，巴迪 -巴迪，再见，小心

536
00:17:12,989 --> 00:17:13,722
Bye, guys.

537
00:17:13,757 --> 00:17:17,027
Bye, buddy. Bye, buddy. Take care.

538
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,550
再见

539
00:17:17,062 --> 00:17:19,017
Bye-bye.

540
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,830
再见

541
00:17:20,663 --> 00:17:22,263
Bye-bye.

542
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,600
拜拜，巴迪

543
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:23,532
Bye-bye, buddy.

544
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,760
拜拜

545
00:17:25,634 --> 00:17:27,226
There, there.

546
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,750
拜拜，巴迪 希望你能找到父亲

547
00:17:36,045 --> 00:17:39,214
Bye, buddy. Hope you find your dad.

548
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,740
谢谢你，独角鲸先生

549
00:17:39,249 --> 00:17:41,205
Thanks, Mr. Narwhal.

550
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,200
再见

551
00:17:42,016 --> 00:17:43,483
Bye.

552
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,110
喂！你叫什么名字？

553
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:36,569
Hey! What's your name?

554
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,840
我叫巴迪

555
00:18:36,604 --> 00:18:39,299
My name's buddy.

556
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,870
抱抱不可以吗？

557
00:18:46,345 --> 00:18:48,347
Does someone need a hug?

558
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,620
这可不妙！

559
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:55,086
Aah, aah! That's not cool!

560
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,820
我只想抱抱你嘛

561
00:18:56,187 --> 00:18:58,280
I just wanted a hug!

562
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,140
嗨

563
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,930
哈罗

564
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:40,828
Hi.

565
00:19:40,863 --> 00:19:42,394
Hello.

566
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,650
谢谢

567
00:19:48,838 --> 00:19:50,734
Thank you.

568
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,170
谢谢

569
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:52,631
Thank you.

570
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,690
你们成功了！恭喜！

571
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:02,116
You did it! Congratulations!

572
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,660
“世上最好的咖啡” 干得好，诸位

573
00:20:02,151 --> 00:20:07,123
"World's best cup of coffee.
"Great job, everybody.

574
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,400
幸会

575
00:20:07,158 --> 00:20:09,858
It's great to meet you.

576
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,960
嗨

577
00:20:09,893 --> 00:20:11,416
Hi.

578
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,980
圣诞老人，圣诞…不

579
00:20:22,737 --> 00:20:25,440
Santa, san... uh, nope.

580
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,880
搞错了

581
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,159
Not Santa.

582
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,380
谢谢

583
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:28,781
Thank you.

584
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,910
谢谢

585
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:30,368
Thank you.

586
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,270
-谢谢   -喂？不行

587
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,726
Thank you. Hey, you know what?
No.

588
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,740
-不行，懂不懂？   -谢谢

589
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,260
滚，走开

590
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:21,158
No, all right? Thank you.

591
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:23,718
Get outta here, get outta here.

592
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,770
-哈罗   -嗨

593
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:00,676
Hello. Hi.

594
00:22:00,711 --> 00:22:02,824
Ooh...

595
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:07,320
漂亮

596
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:08,770
Beautiful.

597
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:20,900
这样看来就跟棵圣诞树一样

598
00:22:18,982 --> 00:22:21,542
Looks like a Christmas tree.

599
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,470
再版？

600
00:22:22,852 --> 00:22:24,886
A reprint?

601
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,340
你知道这会花多少钱吗？

602
00:22:24,921 --> 00:22:26,790
You know how much that's gonna
cost?

603
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,540
足有两页印丢了

604
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,800
整个故事根本毫无意义

605
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:27,956
Two whole pages are missing.

606
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,570
小孩子还能留意到 有两页印少了

607
00:22:27,991 --> 00:22:29,224
The story doesn't make any sense.

608
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:31,511
What, you think some kid's gonna
notice two pages?

609
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,300
他们… 他们只会看图画而已

610
00:22:31,546 --> 00:22:33,762
I mean, they... all they do is look
at pictures.

611
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,350
再往上的路程 我就不能与你同行了

612
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:38,083
Sorry I can't ride with you the
Rest of the way up,

613
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:39,320
不过我父亲可是在此工作 祝你好…

614
00:22:38,118 --> 00:22:40,769
But this is where my dad works.
Well, have a good...

615
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,580
啊，忘了抱你一下！

616
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,520
康妮，我还从没试过…

617
00:22:40,804 --> 00:22:42,002
Oh, I forgot to give you a hug!

618
00:22:42,037 --> 00:22:43,973
Oh, I don't know, Connie,
I've never

619
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,990
给小猫拔爪子

620
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,990
有多少只？

621
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:45,441
Declared kittens before.

622
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,520
八只？

623
00:22:45,476 --> 00:22:46,407
How many?

624
00:22:46,442 --> 00:22:47,942
Eight?

625
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,460
我都不知道会不会有时间

626
00:22:47,977 --> 00:22:49,877
Uh, I don't know if I'm gonna
Have time.

627
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,530
好吧，你这周带过来吧

628
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:52,364
Oh, all right, just bring 'em by
The camper this week,

629
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,360
看看我能怎么做 不会收你费的

630
00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:54,817
And I'll see what I can do. I'm
Not gonna charge you.

631
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,870
带过来就好 我看看有什么能做的

632
00:22:54,852 --> 00:22:57,318
Just bring 'em by, and I'll see
What I can do.

633
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,630
-我得挂了   -对不起

634
00:22:57,353 --> 00:22:59,052
I have to go. Excuse me.

635
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:01,000
我是来找沃特.霍布斯的

636
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:02,457
I'm here to see a Walter hobs.

637
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,510
我是精灵巴迪

638
00:23:02,492 --> 00:23:03,923
I'm buddy the elf. Laughs

639
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:06,800
你好有节日气氛！ 谁叫你来的啊？

640
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:07,528
You look hilarious! Who sent you?

641
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
-精灵爸爸   -精灵爸爸？

642
00:23:07,563 --> 00:23:09,495
Papa elf. Papa elf?

643
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,880
住在北极的

644
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,248
Mm-hmm. From the North Pole.

645
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,510
-北极？   -对

646
00:23:11,283 --> 00:23:12,932
From the North Pole? Yes.

647
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,380
你真觉得该装船？

648
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:15,686
So, you really think we should
Ship 'em?

649
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,950
不，我是觉得我们该洗个 30000美元的淋浴

650
00:23:15,721 --> 00:23:18,048
No, I think we should take a
$30,000 bath

651
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,920
让某些孩子能了解…

652
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:20,375
So some kid can understand
What happened?

653
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,590
在只小狗和怪鸽子身上 发生的事…

654
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,042
To a puppy and a frigging pigeon

655
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,890
装船吧

656
00:23:22,077 --> 00:23:23,961
ship 'em.

657
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:24,390
喂

658
00:23:23,996 --> 00:23:25,811
Yeah.

659
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:27,130
霍布斯先生？ 我，内部通信系统的

00:23:25,846 --> 00:23:28,582
Mr. Hobbs? It's me on the intercom.

00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:27,560
说

662
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,160
看来是有人找了人 给你唱圣诞歌

663
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:28,981
Go ahead.

664
00:23:29,016 --> 00:23:32,611
Yeah, I think some one sent you a
Christmas-gram.

665
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,870
爸爸！

666
00:23:33,854 --> 00:23:35,321

669
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,580
我昼夜步行前来找你

670
00:23:41,246 --> 00:23:43,996
I walked all day and night to
Find you.

671
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,510
看你的样子似乎是从北极来的

672
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:46,966
Uh, you look like you came from
the North Pole.

673
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,180
没错，那正是我前来的起点

674
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,635
That's exactly where I came from.

675
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,390
一定是圣诞老人给了你电话！

676
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,321
Santa must've called you!

677
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,520
对，没错，他…

678

00:23:58,644 --> 00:24:00,880
Well, are... are you gonna sing a
Song or something,

687
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,200
要不然我可直接回去工作了

688
00:24:00,915 --> 00:24:02,648
Or can I just go back to work?

689
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,100
唱歌？

690
00:24:02,683 --> 00:24:05,516

And we never met

698
00:24:17,162 --> 00:24:20,999
And he wants me to sing
Him a song

699
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,800
“我从小被领养”

700
00:24:21,034 --> 00:24:22,499
And, um, I was adopted

701
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,450
“你甚至不知道我的诞生”

702
00:24:22,534 --> 00:24:24,868
But you didn't know I was born

703
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:27,920
“而我来了，找到了你 我的爸爸”

圣诞老人！！

825
00:27:51,402 --> 00:27:52,833
Santa!

826
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,900
哦，我的天

827
00:27:52,868 --> 00:27:54,301
Oh, my god!

828
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:57,300
圣诞老人，我认识他

829
00:27:54,336 --> 00:27:58,741
Santa here?! I know him.

830
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,170
我认识他

831
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,640
他要来这里 给所有的孩子发礼物

832
00:27:58,776 --> 00:27:59,573
I know him.

833
00:27:59,608 --> 00:28:01,076
He'll be hereto take pictures

834
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,130
还会带很多种子来

835
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:02,578
With all the children.

836
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,270
-就是明天清早 -明天清早？

837
00:28:02,613 --> 00:28:03,043
Yeah!

838
00:28:03,078 --> 00:28:05,714
Just keep your receipts.

839
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,270
明早10点钟

840
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,410
嗨，圣诞老人要来了

841
00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:06,680
10 a.m. Tomorrow.

842
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,430
是的.你能否帮我邀呼这话？

843
00:28:06,715 --> 00:28:07,815
Santa's coming to town.

844
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,885
Yes. Can you sign this for me?

845
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,621
Ohh! Hi.

846
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,150
圣诞老人要来

847
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,000
喜欢这种布景吗？

848
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,270
你是一个非常精美的装饰家

849
00:28:34,275 --> 00:28:35,408
Are you enjoying the view?

850
00:28:35,443 --> 00:28:38,712
You are very good at decorating
that tree.

851
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,310
你为什么要夸奖我？

852
00:28:38,747 --> 00:28:40,731
Why are you messing with me?

853
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,280
是克伦皮特让你来的吗？

854
00:28:40,766 --> 00:28:42,716
Did krumpet put you up to this?

855
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,710
我没有夸奖你啊

856
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,680
只是很高兴能遇到…

857
00:28:42,751 --> 00:28:44,116
I'm not messing with you.

858
00:28:44,151 --> 00:28:46,136
It's just nice to meet
Another human

859
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,680
一个能与我共享精灵文化的人

860
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:48,664
Who shares my affinity for?
Elf culture.

861
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,720
我只是想过这节日而已

862
00:28:48,699 --> 00:28:51,158
I'm just trying to get
through the holidays.

863
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,190
过节？

864
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:53,720
你知道 圣诞节是世界最美好的

865
00:28:51,193 --> 00:28:51,590
Get through?

866
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:55,162
Christmas is the greatest
Day in the whole wide world!

867
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,860
请别和我说话

868
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,730
像是有人要…

869
00:28:55,197 --> 00:28:56,681
Please stop talking to me.

870
00:28:56,716 --> 00:28:58,130
Uh-oh. Sounds like someone

871
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,900
唱圣诞歌似的

872
00:28:58,165 --> 00:29:00,334
Needs to sing a Christmas
Carol.

873
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,460
走吧

874
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,230
表达圣诞喜悦之情 最好的方式是…

875
00:29:00,369 --> 00:29:00,866
Go away.

876
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:02,668
The best way to
Spread Christmas cheer

877
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,900
引吭高歌以让大家都分享到

878
00:29:02,703 --> 00:29:04,337
Is singing loud for all to hear.

879
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,300
谢谢，但我不想唱

880
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,500
很简单的，就像聊天一样

881
00:29:04,372 --> 00:29:05,436
Thanks, but I don't sing.

882
00:29:05,471 --> 00:29:07,940
Oh, it's easy, it's just like
Talking...

883
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,470
无非是让你声音放大拉长

884
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,700
然后让它错落有致罢了

885
00:29:07,975 --> 00:29:08,873
Except louder and longer

886
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,440
我会唱，只是不唱

887
00:29:08,908 --> 00:29:10,107
And you move your voice up
And down.

888
00:29:10,142 --> 00:29:12,878
I can sing, but I just choose not
to sing.

889
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,440
特别在一个陌生人面前

890
00:29:12,913 --> 00:29:15,064
Especially in front of other
people.

891
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,780
如果你能一个人唱…

892
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:17,181
Well, if you sing alone,
You can sing

893
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,410
你也可以唱其他人面前唱 这没什么两样的

894
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:18,851
In front of other people. There's
no difference.

895
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:19,980
实际上有很大的不同

896
00:29:18,886 --> 00:29:21,420
Actually, there's a big difference.

897
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,920
不，不是的

898
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:23,356
No, there... no, there isn't.

899
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,410
等等

900
00:29:23,391 --> 00:29:24,846
Wait.

901
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,220
我唱歌

902
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,760
我在商店，我唱歌

903
00:29:25,825 --> 00:29:26,623
I'm singing

904
00:29:26,658 --> 00:29:30,011
I'm in a store, and I'm singing

905
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,930
我在商店，我唱歌

906
00:29:30,046 --> 00:29:33,330
I'm in a store, and I'm singing

907
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:35,360
嘿，别在“北极熊”那里唱

908
00:29:33,365 --> 00:29:36,801
Hey! There's no singing in the
North Pole.

909
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,400
不，可以的

910
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,000
不，不行

911
00:29:36,836 --> 00:29:38,136
Yes, there is.

912
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,400
-我们随时都要唱歌 -不，不能在那里

913
00:29:38,171 --> 00:29:39,402
No, there's not.

914
00:29:39,437 --> 00:29:41,840
We sing all the time.
No, there's not.

915
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,400
特别是在买玩具时

916
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:44,476
Especially when we make toys.

917
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:43,770
看见了吗？

918
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:46,480
各位顾客，请注意…

919
00:29:44,511 --> 00:29:45,175
See?

920
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:47,512
Attention,
all gimbel's shoppers,

921
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,380
请您把我好最后的购物时间

922
00:29:47,547 --> 00:29:49,998
Please make your final purchases.

923
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,100
我们十分钟后关档

924
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:52,859
We'll be closing in ten minutes.

925
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,250
好了，我该回家了

926
00:29:52,894 --> 00:29:55,651
Well, it's time for me to go home.

927
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,920
但是圣诞老人要来 还有很多事情要做

928
00:29:55,686 --> 00:29:59,356
But... but Santa's coming,
There's so much to do.

929
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,260
是啊

930
00:29:59,391 --> 00:30:02,658
Yeah, um... laughs

931
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,790

00:30:02,693 --> 00:30:05,229
I'll see you tomorrow...

933
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:07,000
-巴迪   -乔威

934
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:08,432
Buddy. Jovie.

935
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,900
-嗨   -嗨

936
00:30:08,467 --> 00:30:10,525

00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,300
乔威

938
00:30:13,203 --> 00:30:14,471
Jovie.

939
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,330
嘿，我到卧室去吃？

940
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,759
Hey, uh... I'm gonna eat in the
bedroom, okay?

941
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,460
我，我还有…

942
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,160
一大堆事情要做

943
00:31:11,794 --> 00:31:12,858
I, uh, I got

944
00:31:12,893 --> 00:31:14,560
A bunch of stuff to go over.

945
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,500
-真的吗？ -只是还拉下…

946
00:31:14,595 --> 00:31:16,931
Are you sure? I'm... I'm just way
Behind

947
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,330
很多事情未完成

948
00:31:16,966 --> 00:31:18,766
On a bunch of stuff.

949
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,660
好吧

950
00:31:18,801 --> 00:31:20,097
Okay.

951
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,840
我能在自己房间吃吗？

952
00:31:23,604 --> 00:31:25,272
Can I eat in my room?

953
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,370
-不行   -为什么不行？

954
00:31:25,307 --> 00:31:26,772
No. Why not?

955
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,440
爸爸都进他的房间了

956
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,910
我还有很多功课要做

957
00:31:26,807 --> 00:31:27,839
Dad's eating in his room.

958
00:31:27,874 --> 00:31:30,243
I got a bunch
Of homework to go over,

959
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:31,180
我拉下了不少功课

960
00:31:30,278 --> 00:31:32,612
And I'm way behind on a bunch
of stuff.

961
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,670
你在这吃

962
00:31:32,647 --> 00:31:35,103
You're eating here.

963
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:10,520
我是真的无法呆下去

964
00:32:08,614 --> 00:32:11,850
I really can't stay

965
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,660
我必须离开

966
00:32:11,885 --> 00:32:15,454
I've got to go 'way

967
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:17,590
这个夜晚真的…

968
00:32:15,489 --> 00:32:19,023
This evening has been

969
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:21,100
是太美好了

970
00:32:19,058 --> 00:32:22,492
So very nice

971
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,130
母亲开始担心…

972
00:32:22,527 --> 00:32:26,529
My mother will start to worry

973
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:29,710
父亲来回踱步

974
00:32:26,564 --> 00:32:31,135
And father will be pacing'
The floor

975
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:34,100
因此，我最好赶快离开

976
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:35,404
So, really, I'd better scurry

977
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:38,910
也许仅仅再和半杯

978
00:32:35,439 --> 00:32:40,308
Well, may be just a half a drink
More

979
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:43,450
-也许邻居会想 -宝贝，在外面呆着不好

980
00:32:40,343 --> 00:32:44,881
The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there

981
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:45,760
说，酒里面放的是什么？

982
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:47,401
Say, what's in this drink?

983
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,460
没有出租车会到达这里

984
00:32:47,436 --> 00:32:49,851
No cabs to be had out there

985
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:53,730
我希望知道如何才不用轮班

986
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:55,123
I wish I knew how to break the
Spell

987
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:57,930
我拿起你的帽 你的秀发飘逸

988
00:32:55,158 --> 00:32:59,362
I'll take your hat, your hair
Looks swell

989
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:00,440
我应该说，“不，不，先生”

990
00:32:59,397 --> 00:33:01,865
I ought to say no, no, no, sir

991
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,470
我能靠近点吗？

992
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,865
Mind if I move in closer?

993
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,670
至少我要说我累了

994
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,285
At least I'm gonna say that
I tried

995
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:07,240
伤害我的自尊是何感觉

996
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,671
What's the sense of hurting?
My pride?

997
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,110
我真的无法再呆

998
00:33:08,706 --> 00:33:11,505
I really can't stay

999
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:17,480
-但外面很冷 -但外面很冷

1000
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:18,914
Ah, but it's cold outside baby,
it's cold outside!

1001
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,000
出去，不要看着我！

1002
00:33:24,887 --> 00:33:27,423
Get out! Don't look at me!

1003
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,460
出去！

1004
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:28,889
Get out!

1005
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,100
只听到雪橇…

1006
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,439
Just hear those sleigh bells
Jingling

1007
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,520
叮当叮当的响声

1008
00:33:44,474 --> 00:33:47,907
Ring-ting-tingling, too

1009
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,820

一起玩雪橇的好天气

1012
00:33:50,245 --> 00:33:54,248
For a sleigh ride together
With you

1013
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,120
外面下着雪…

1014
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:56,617
Outside the snow is falling

1015
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,530
朋友呼唤着你

1016
00:33:56,652 --> 00:33:58,952
And friends are calling yoo-hoo

1017
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:58,460
爸爸？

1018
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,660
-快点，这是好天气 -爸爸

1019
00:33:58,987 --> 00:33:59,851
Dad?

1020
00:33:59,886 --> 00:34:02,054
Come on, its lovely weather dad.

1021
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,700
-爸爸，是我 -可以和你一起玩雪橇

1022
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:05,492
Dad, hi! It's me! For a sleigh
Ride together with you

1023
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,930
爸爸，爸爸！

1024
00:34:05,527 --> 00:34:07,326
Buddy. Dad! Dad! Dad!

1025
00:34:07,361 --> 00:34:10,847
Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap

1026
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,910
快走吧，看看这大雪

1027
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:14,299
Let's go, let's look at the show

1028
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:17,850
我们遨游在雪地仙境

1029
00:34:14,334 --> 00:34:19,272
We're riding in a wonderland
Of snow

1030
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:18,880
-嘿！   -好的

1031
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,520
我只是拿个礼物给我爸爸

1032
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,271
Hey! It's okay,

1033
00:34:20,306 --> 00:34:21,941
I just have a gift for my dad.

1034
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,420
我会帮你寄的

1035
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,200
那好，切记告诉他…

1036
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:22,807
Okay, I'll take this.

1037
00:34:22,842 --> 00:34:24,443
Okay. Well, just make sure he knows

1038
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,620
是他儿子巴迪送的，行吗？

1039
00:34:24,478 --> 00:34:25,879
It's from me buddy, his son, okay?

1040
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,860
我非常爱他

1041
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,390
在我心里他是世界上 最好的父亲

1042
00:34:25,914 --> 00:34:27,245
Okay. And that I love him so much,

1043
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,815
And that I think he's the greatest
dad in the world.

1044
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:29,690
你们两个力气真大

1045
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,160
我的脸红的像玫瑰

1046
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,082
You guys are so strong.

1047
00:34:31,117 --> 00:34:33,551
Wow! My cheeks are nice
And rosy

1048
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,460
这里整洁舒适

1049
00:34:33,586 --> 00:34:36,889
This is neat. And comfy
Cozy are we

1050
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,670
我们有如两只…

1051
00:34:36,924 --> 00:34:40,057
We're snuggled up together

1052
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:42,640
小鸟般相互偎依

1053
00:34:40,092 --> 00:34:44,062
Like two birds of a feather
Would be

1054
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,540
让我们启程…

1055
00:34:44,097 --> 00:34:46,965
Let's take that road before us

1056
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,880
一起合唱

1057
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,818
And sing a chorus or two

1058
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,210
来吧，这么好的天气   …

1059
00:34:49,853 --> 00:34:52,602
Come on, it's lovely weather

1060
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:56,150
真是玩雪橇的时刻

1061
00:34:52,637 --> 00:34:57,574
For a sleigh ride together
With you

1062
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,660
-嘿，你   -我？

1063
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,049
Hey, you. Me?

1064
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:09,500
过来，我有话对你说

1065
00:35:07,084 --> 00:35:10,918
Come here. I wanna talk to you.

1066
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,700
你想对我说什么？

1067
00:35:12,323 --> 00:35:14,124
What do you wanna talk to?
Me about?

1068
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,400
你今天早上…

1069
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,970
是如何跑到女换衣间去的？

1070
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:14,790
How come you were

1071
00:35:14,825 --> 00:35:17,394
In the women's locker room these
morning?

1072
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:16,710
我听到你唱歌

1073
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,110
你确定我洗澡的时候…

1074
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:18,093
I heard you singing.

1075
00:35:18,128 --> 00:35:20,531
You sure it had nothing to
Do with the fact

1076
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,540
你没做其他的事？

1077
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,410
我不知道你没穿衣服

1078
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:22,200
That I was naked in the shower?

1079
00:35:22,235 --> 00:35:24,419
I didn't know you were naked.

1080
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:25,180
你为何这么早来？

1081
00:35:24,454 --> 00:35:26,046
Why were you here so early?

1082
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,220
他们把水关了

1083
00:35:26,081 --> 00:35:27,603
They shut my water off.

1084
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,800
你这么早到这做什么？

1085
00:35:27,638 --> 00:35:30,506
What were you doing here so
early?

1086
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,420
搭这些东西

1087
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:32,838
Building this.

1088
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,720
是你搭的？

1089
00:35:34,077 --> 00:35:36,110
You built this?

1090
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,430
这只是小事一桩

1091
00:35:36,145 --> 00:35:38,848
They're kind a pissed about
this.

1092
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,720
真的？

1093
00:35:38,883 --> 00:35:40,145
Really?

1094
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,960
嘿，伙计

1095
00:35:40,883 --> 00:35:42,350
Hey, guys.

1096
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,000
你没看看这地方吗？

1097
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,670
很不错的地方 真的很不错

1098
00:35:42,385 --> 00:35:43,384
Have you seen the place?

1099
00:35:43,419 --> 00:35:45,521
It's pretty good. It's a
little too good.

1100
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,200
团体必须受个人委派

1101
00:35:45,556 --> 00:35:47,588
Corporate must have sent in a
professional.

1102
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,700
我不知为何有人 为我的工作拼命

1103
00:35:47,623 --> 00:35:50,493
I don't know why some body's
Gunning' for my job,

1104
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,710
但…这是个团体，知道吗？

1105
00:35:50,528 --> 00:35:54,130
But, look... let's
Remain team, okay?

1106
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:55,240
因为如果我走了 大家都得走人

1107
00:35:54,165 --> 00:35:56,115
'Cause if I go, we all go.

1108
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,650
如果你让什么人发现了

1109
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,031
If you get wind of anything,

1110
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:59,250
在电台呼叫我，第三频道

1111
00:35:58,066 --> 00:36:00,634
Call me on my radio,
Channel three.

00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,280

1113
00:36:00,669 --> 00:36:03,705
Code word is "Santa's got
A brand new bag,"

1114
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,620
好不好？

1115
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,036
Okay?

1116
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,720
六英寸卷带，宝贝

1117
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,560
Six-inch ribbon curis, honey.

1118
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:10,160
-这不可能 -6…英寸

1119
00:36:08,595 --> 00:36:11,580
That's impossible. Six... inches.

1120
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,800
顺便说句… 我觉得你的…

1121
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,918
By the way... I think you have

最最动听的

00:36:18,722 --> 00:36:20,677
In the whole wide world.

1126
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,500
圣诞老人

1127
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:29,895
Santa...

1128
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,550
圣诞老人，是我，巴迪！

1129
00:36:33,701 --> 00:36:35,034

00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,500
你多大了，孩子？

1153
00:37:01,296 --> 00:37:02,394
Ho ho ho ho ho!

1154
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:05,465

4岁

1156
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,200
你是大孩子了，你叫什么名？

1157
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:05,997
Four.

1158
00:37:06,032 --> 00:37:07,399
You're a big boy, what's
your name?

1159
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,580
-保罗 -想要什么圣诞礼物？

1160
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:10,002
Paul. And, uh, what can I
get you for Christmas?

1161
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,820
保罗，别告诉他你要什么

1162
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,250
-他骗人的 -让这孩子说

1163
00:37:10,037 --> 00:37:11,236
Paul... don't tell him what
You want.

1164
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,637
He's a liar. Let the kid talk.

1165
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:15,520
你真让人恶心 自己也能忍受？

1166
00:37:13,672 --> 00:37:16,942
You disgust me. How can you live?
With yourself?

1167
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,690
-安静点   -笑一笑

1168
00:37:16,977 --> 00:37:19,111
Just cool it, zippy. Woman:
Smile.

1169
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,530
你可以去当吹牛大王了

1170
00:37:19,146 --> 00:37:20,911
You sit on a throne of lies.

1171
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,700
我并不想骗你

1172
00:37:20,946 --> 00:37:23,115
Look, I'm not kidding'.
You're a fake.

1173
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,700
-我骗你了？   -是的

1174
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,300
你是不是想死？

1175
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,081
I'm a fake? Yes.

1176
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:26,452
How'd you like to be dead, huh?

1177
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,400
-骗人   -不，他在开玩笑

1178
00:37:26,487 --> 00:37:29,455
Fake. No, he's kidding.

1179
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:28,570
你真恶心

1180
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,910
我想你会过个美丽的圣诞节的

1181
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:29,953
You stink.

1182
00:37:29,988 --> 00:37:32,323
I think you're gonna have a good
Christmas, all right?

1183
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,270
你闻起来像牛奶干酪

1184
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:34,310
你一点都不像圣诞老人

1185
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:34,042
You smell like beef and cheese.

1186
00:37:34,077 --> 00:37:35,726
You don't smell like Santa.

1187
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,570
好了

1188
00:37:35,761 --> 00:37:36,994
Okay.

1189
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,110
他是冒牌的！ 他不是圣诞老人！

1190
00:37:38,596 --> 00:37:41,531
He's an imposter! He's not
Santa!

1191
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:45,900
-他是冒牌货！   -过来

1192
00:37:42,266 --> 00:37:46,504
He's a fake! He's a fake!

1193
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,550

00:37:49,807 --> 00:37:51,536
He's a fake!

1197
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:59,170
看你往哪跑？ 你想跑去哪…

1198
00:37:57,147 --> 00:38:00,583
Ha ha! Where you going now?

No!

1201
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:15,620
他不是圣诞老人

1202
00:38:13,663 --> 00:38:17,033
He's not Santa Claus!

1203
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,410
他不是圣诞老人

1204
00:38:17,068 --> 00:38:18,830
He's not Santa!

1205
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,380
“给某个特别的人”

1206
00:38:21,036 --> 00:38:22,799
"To someone special."

1207
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,320
-那是什么？   -对讲机

1208
00:38:49,564 --> 00:38:51,733
What's that? Intercom.

1209
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,410
好的

1210
00:38:51,768 --> 00:38:53,835
All right.

1211
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:59,130
-什么事？ 霍布斯先生，是警察有事找你

1212
00:38:56,538 --> 00:39:00,542
Yeah? Mr. Hobbs, the police are

1213
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,930
警察.你好？

I knew that you'd come,
I love you for coming.

1219
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:25,420
汤姆警官，这是我父亲

1220
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:26,367
Officer tom, this is my dad.

1221

他来保释我的

1224
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,690
他们让我打个电话

1225
00:39:27,936 --> 00:39:28,700
He bailed me out.

1226
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:29,730
他们让我打个电话

1227
00:39:28,735 --> 00:39:29,936
They gave me one phone call.

1228
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:32,190
我说“我知道要…”

1229
00:39:29,971 --> 00:39:31,103
They gave me one phone call,

1230

And sure enough, you showed up.

1236
00:39:35,308 --> 00:39:37,326
You did, they said you weren't
goanna show up.

1237
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,930
-他们告诉我… -那么多次…

1238
00:39:37,361 --> 00:39:39,988
They told me so many times...
shh shh shh shh shh.

1239
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:41,200
你到底是谁 哪条神经线接错了？

1240
00:39:40,023 --> 00:39:42,615
Just who the heck are you,
And what is your problem?

1241
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,340
我是巴迪，是你的儿子

1242
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,750
L- I'm buddy, I'm your son.

1243
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,470
等等…

1244
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,710
告诉我…

1245
00:39:44,785 --> 00:39:45,850
Wait, um...

1246
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:47,737
Tell me, tell me, tell me, uh...

1247
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,180
你这照片哪来的？

1248
00:39:47,772 --> 00:39:49,589
Where'd you get this picture?

1249
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,770
精灵爸爸给我的

1250
00:39:49,624 --> 00:39:52,183
Papa elf gave it to me.

1251
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,680
给我听着… 这是小孩子的游戏吗？

1252
00:39:53,092 --> 00:39:55,094
Listen... is this some kind a
game?

1253
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,880
你要什么，钱吗？

1254
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,750
不！我只是想见你

1255
00:39:55,129 --> 00:39:56,646
What do you want, some money?

1256
00:39:56,681 --> 00:39:58,128
No! I just wanted to meet you,

1257
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,980
并且，我以为你也想见我

1258
00:39:58,163 --> 00:40:01,394
And I thought you might Anna
Meet me.

1259
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:07,220
谁不想见你？

1260
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,634
Who wouldn't Anna meet you?

1261
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:09,460
我们搭个华丽的房子

1262
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,209
I thought maybe we could make
Gingerbread houses,

1263
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:12,270
然后去吃甜酥饼干 再去溜冰

1264
00:40:11,244 --> 00:40:13,678
And eat cookie dough, and go
Ice skating, and...

1265
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,500
并且还手挽手地

1266
00:40:13,713 --> 00:40:15,914
And maybe even hold hands.

1267
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:18,360
-跟我来   -好的

1268
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:19,775
Come with me. Okay.

1269
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:29,240
我们要做什么？

1270
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:30,650
Okay. What have we got here?

1271
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:40,600
巴迪，别吃那些东西

1272
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:41,466
Buddy, don't eat those.

1273
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,900
情况真的很紧急，沃特

1274
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,540
下午剩余的时间 我得做双倍的登记

1275
00:40:47,944 --> 00:40:49,277
We got to really hurry up, Walter,

1276
00:40:49,312 --> 00:40:51,948
'cause I'm double booked the
rest of the afternoon.

1277
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,700
我生病了吗？

1278
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,340
是的 但我们来不是为了这

1279
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:52,447
Am I sick?

1280
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,340
我们来做个检查

1281
00:40:52,482 --> 00:40:53,750
Yeah, but that's not why we're
Here.

1282
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,410
-什么样的检查？ -检查一下…

1283
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:54,716
We're hereto do a test, come on.

1284
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,550
-你是否是我的儿子 -为什么我坐在纸上？

1285
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:55,783
What kind test? Just a test to
Find out

1286
00:40:55,818 --> 00:40:57,954
If you're my son or not. Why am
I sitting on paper?

1287
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,750
这样对其他的病人卫生点

1288
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:59,973
Because it's sanitary for the
other patients.

1289
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,550
静静坐着 让我能扎你的手指

1290
00:41:00,008 --> 00:41:01,958
Now, sit still so I can do
the finger prick.

1291
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,380
扎手指！

1292
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:03,577
Finger prick!

1293
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,750
真是令人颤栗

1294
00:41:03,612 --> 00:41:05,126
Ohh! It's cold.

1295
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,790
你就安静坐着就好了

1296
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:05,850
好，我能听听那听诊器吗？

1297
00:41:05,161 --> 00:41:06,212
Yeah, just pleases it still,
Please?

1298
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,420
-不，不能让你听 你只要安静坐着…

1299
00:41:06,247 --> 00:41:07,228
Okay, can I listen to your
necklace?

1300
00:41:07,263 --> 00:41:08,831
No, you can't. Will you
Just sit still...

1301
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,460
那里为什么有个骨加？

1302
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,830
我不清楚.沃特，你能不能

1303
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:09,831
Why is there a skeleton?
Over there?

1304
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:10,830
看起来怎么像是个海盗旗

1305
00:41:09,866 --> 00:41:11,049
I don't know, Walter,
Could you please...?

1306
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:11,890
你能不能让他安静坐下？

1307
00:41:11,084 --> 00:41:12,192
If I squint it looks like a
pirate flag.

1308
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:13,330
-他叫什么名字？ -不，他没有名字

1309
00:41:12,227 --> 00:41:13,266
Could you please have him?
Sit still?

1310
00:41:13,301 --> 00:41:14,736
Does he have a name? No,
He hasn't got a name.

1311
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:14,330
抱歉，本.抱歉

1312
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:15,300
还有很多病人等着我

1313
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:15,702
I'm sorry, Ben, I am sorry.

1314
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,400
你能不能静静坐下来？

1315
00:41:15,737 --> 00:41:16,771
I have a lot of patients
waiting.

1316
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,530
-他发狂了   -是的

1317
00:41:16,806 --> 00:41:18,373
Would you please it still?
Please.

1318
00:41:18,408 --> 00:41:19,906
He got mad at me. Yes, he did.
He did.

1319
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:20,800
你越快静下来 我们越早做完检查

1320
00:41:19,941 --> 00:41:22,210
The sooner you sit still,
The sooner we can

1321
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,570
克服困难，度过难关

1322
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:23,270
好，然后我们去吃球形糖果？

1323
00:41:22,245 --> 00:41:22,943
Get this mess over with.

1324
00:41:22,978 --> 00:41:24,429
Okay. Then can we eat sugar
plums?

1325
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,470
你说的啊… 我们去吃球形糖果

1326
00:41:24,464 --> 00:41:25,846
You betch a... we'll eat sugar
Plums,

1327
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:27,410
搭个华丽的小屋 甚至可以在里面画画鸡蛋

1328
00:41:25,881 --> 00:41:28,817
Have gingerbread houses,
And we'll even paint eggs.

1329
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,810
画鸡蛋，这真是太容易了

1330
00:41:28,852 --> 00:41:31,217
Well, paint eggs, that's Easter.

1331
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,980
我的手指也有心跳

1332
00:41:35,289 --> 00:41:37,356
My finger has a heartbeat.

1333
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,790
再刺一点点就受伤了

1334
00:41:37,391 --> 00:41:40,194
It won't hurt so much after
a little.

1335
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,590
你叫什么？

1336
00:41:40,229 --> 00:41:41,996
What's your name?

1337
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,290
巴迪

1338
00:41:42,031 --> 00:41:43,663
Buddy.

1339
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,850
我叫卡罗琳

1340
00:41:43,698 --> 00:41:45,266
I'm Carolyn.

1341
00:41:45,301 --> 00:41:46,733
Hi.

1342
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:47,490
你想要什么圣诞礼物？

1343
00:41:47,201 --> 00:41:48,903
What do you want for Christmas?

1344
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,330
我会在圣诞老人面前美言几句

1345
00:41:48,938 --> 00:41:49,969
A Suzy-talks-a-lot.

1346
00:41:50,004 --> 00:41:52,740
I'll put in a good word with
the big man.

1347
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,300
谢谢.你的装扮很可爱

1348
00:41:52,775 --> 00:41:54,674
Thanks. Your costume is pretty.

1349
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,610
这不是装扮的，我就是这样

1350
00:41:54,709 --> 00:41:58,012
Oh, it's not a costume.
I'm an elf.

1351
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,510
表面上，我是人类

1352
00:41:58,047 --> 00:41:59,913
Well, technically, I'm a human,

1353
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,100
但是精灵由养大的

1354
00:41:59,948 --> 00:42:01,379
But I was raised by elves.

1355
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,380
哦，我是人类，是人类养大的

1356
00:42:01,414 --> 00:42:04,784
Oh, I'm a human raised by humans.

1357
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,400
不错

1358
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:07,446
Hmm. Cool.

1359
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:13,380
怎么样？

1360
00:42:12,258 --> 00:42:14,783
So?

1361
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,160
是个男孩…巴迪是你的儿子

1362
00:42:16,362 --> 00:42:19,566
It's a boy... buddy's your son.

1363
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,830
真是太不可思议了

1364
00:42:19,601 --> 00:42:21,199
That's very impossible.

1365
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,100
你也看到外面那家伙了

1366
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:22,835
You... you saw that guy out there.

1367
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,300
他显然是有精神病的

1368
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:24,336
He's... he's certifiably insane.

1369
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,400
他可能只是回复到…

1370
00:42:24,371 --> 00:42:25,769
He's probably just reverting

1371
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,000
孩童般的阶段而已

1372
00:42:25,804 --> 00:42:28,407
To a state of childlike
dependency.

1373
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
精灵？

1374
00:42:28,442 --> 00:42:29,373
An elf?

1375
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,400
他最需要的是教养

1376
00:42:29,408 --> 00:42:31,443
What he needs is to be nurtured.

1377
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,300
我明白了

1378
00:42:31,478 --> 00:42:33,462
Oh, I see.

1379
00:42:33,497 --> 00:42:35,412
So, um, uh...

1380
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,100
你要我养育他？

1381
00:42:35,447 --> 00:42:37,132
You'd like me to breastfeed him?

1382
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,410
沃特，只是带他回家

1383
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:38,782
Walter, just bring him home.

1384
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:39,610
把他交给艾米丽和迈克尔

1385
00:42:38,817 --> 00:42:39,983
Introduce him to Emily and
Michael,

1386
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,850
慢慢地他就会适应现实生活

1387
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:42,219
And once... once he comes to
Terms with reality,

1388
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,990
他得抛开精灵的影响 开始自己的人生

1389
00:42:42,254 --> 00:42:45,390
He should drop the whole elf
Thing and move on with his life.

1390
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:47,490
我是指如果我是你 我能做的就这些

1391
00:42:45,425 --> 00:42:47,892
I mean, that's what I would do if
I was you.

1392
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:51,600
哦，我的天！ 沃特，这真是…

1393
00:42:47,927 --> 00:42:51,462
Oh, my god! Walter, this is...

1394
00:42:51,497 --> 00:42:52,762
This is wonderful,

1395
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,390
真是太好了

1396
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:55,160
你有了另一个儿子

1397
00:42:52,797 --> 00:42:54,649
You... you have another son.

1398
00:42:54,684 --> 00:42:56,466
Wonderful. Oh, gosh, I...

1399
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,100
太好了.哦，糟透了…

1400
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,900
我可从没有那样想过

1401
00:42:56,501 --> 00:42:59,303
I guess I never really thought
of it that way.

1402
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,370
真是难以置信，我…

1403
00:42:59,338 --> 00:43:00,737
This is incredible, I...

1404
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,570
你知道，这有点难解

1405
00:43:00,772 --> 00:43:03,024
You know, it's a little
complicated,

1406
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,870
但没什么.我们可以搞定

1407
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:05,276
But it's nothing that we can't
handle.

1408
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:07,380
-亲爱的？   -怎么？

1409
00:43:05,311 --> 00:43:07,744
Honey? What?

1410
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:10,380
他把自己当成精灵了

1411
00:43:07,779 --> 00:43:10,782
He thinks he's an elf.

1412
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,510
抱歉，你说什么？

1413
00:43:10,817 --> 00:43:11,880
I'm sorry, what?

1414
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:14,180
他以为自己是圣诞精灵

1415
00:43:11,915 --> 00:43:14,584
He think she's a Christmas elf.

1416
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:14,920
哦，沃特

1417
00:43:14,619 --> 00:43:15,283
Oh, come on, Walter,

1418
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:19,110
我敢说 他实际上并不是真的这么想

1419
00:43:15,318 --> 00:43:19,516
I'm sure he doesn't actually
think he's an elf.

1420
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,520
然后我穿过七个小矮人…

1421
00:43:19,623 --> 00:43:22,926
And then, I traveled through
the seven levels

1422
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,600
所在的糖果森林

1423
00:43:22,961 --> 00:43:24,426
Of the candy cane forest,

1424
00:43:24,461 --> 00:43:28,597
Past the sea of swirly-twirly
gumdrops,

1425
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,230
越过波涛汹涌的软糖海洋

1426
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:33,900
然后我走过“林肯隧道”

1427
00:43:28,632 --> 00:43:34,298
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel.

1428
00:43:51,821 --> 00:43:53,516
Ahh.

1429
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,260
那么最近的30年你去了哪里？

1430
00:43:54,957 --> 00:43:58,661
So, where were you for the
last 30 years?

1431
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,190
到了北极

1432
00:43:58,696 --> 00:43:59,560
The north pole.

1433
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,930
能否帮我把糖浆拿过来？

1434
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:02,280
Can you pass the maple syrup?
Please?

1435
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:04,570
我没拿…这是意大利面条

1436
00:44:02,315 --> 00:44:06,159
I... I didn't put... it's
spaghetti.

1437
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:09,600
你知道什么？ 我记得我有一瓶

1438
00:44:06,194 --> 00:44:10,004
Oh, you know what? I think
I have some.

1439
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,400
没错

1440
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:11,437
Yes.

1441
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,940
你喜欢甜食？

1442
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,125
You like sugar, huh?

1443
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,510
糖浆里面含有糖？

1444
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,910
Is there sugar in syrup?

1445
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:16,710
是的

1446
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:17,076
Yes.

1447
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:17,980
那么，当然喜欢糖了

1448
00:44:17,111 --> 00:44:18,344
Then yes.

1449
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:20,480
我们精灵坚持食用四种食物

1450
00:44:18,379 --> 00:44:20,882
We elves try to stick to the
four main food groups

1451
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:26,590
糖果，蔗糖，玉米糖，糖浆

1452
00:44:20,917 --> 00:44:26,987
Candy, candy canes, candy corns,
and syrup.

1453
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:30,260
那你会何我们呆在一起吗？

1454
00:44:27,022 --> 00:44:30,657
So, will you be staying with us?
Then?

1455
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,460
你觉得我可以吗？

1456
00:44:30,692 --> 00:44:31,824
You mean I can stay?

1457
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,990
-当然可以了 -艾米丽

1458
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:33,358
Of course you can. Emily.

1459
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:35,500
你能和我们一起呆多长时间？

1460
00:44:33,393 --> 00:44:35,896
How... how long do you think
you'll be with us?

1461
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,130
我还没有想过

1462
00:44:35,931 --> 00:44:38,399
I... I hadn't really planned
it out,

1463
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:40,470
但我想，可能…永远呆一起

1464
00:44:38,434 --> 00:44:40,833
But I was thinking, like...
forever.

1465
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:43,200
艾米丽？ 我能否单独和你聊一会

1466
00:44:40,868 --> 00:44:43,604
Emily? Can I just speak to you
for a minute

1467
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,000
到厨房去，行吗？

1468
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,402
in the, uh, kitchen, please?

1469
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,310
你疯了吗？他不能呆这里

1470
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:51,210
Are you crazy? He cannot
stay here.

1471
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:52,980
很明显，他是认真的

1472
00:44:51,245 --> 00:44:53,344
Clearly he has some serious issues.

1473
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,220
我们不能把他抛去淋雪

1474
00:44:53,379 --> 00:44:55,615
We can't just throw him out in
the snow.

1475
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,800
为什么不行？他喜欢雪

1476
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:57,483
Why not? He loves the snow.

1477
00:44:57,518 --> 00:44:59,531
He's told me 15 times.

1478
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,590
他告诉过我15此了

1479
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:01,150
沃特，他是你儿子

1480
00:44:59,566 --> 00:45:01,545
Walter, he's your son.

1481
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,700
你听到了吗？

1482
00:45:15,433 --> 00:45:17,094
Did you hear that?

1483
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,730
你真是太离奇了

1484
00:45:18,436 --> 00:45:21,132
You are so weird.

1485
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,800
爸爸？

1486
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:24,474
Dad?

1487
00:45:27,445 --> 00:45:29,208
Dad?

1488
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,810
爸爸？

1489
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,800
爸爸！

1490
00:45:30,081 --> 00:45:32,481
Dad!

1491
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:33,890
什么事？

1492
00:45:33,151 --> 00:45:34,286
What?

1493
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:35,690
我睡不着…

1494
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:37,860
除非能帮我把被边 塞进垫褥底下

1495
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,130
什么？

1496
00:45:38,255 --> 00:45:39,523
What?

1497
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:43,600
把被边塞进垫褥底下 我才睡的着

1498
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,300
我不会帮你的

1499
00:45:43,761 --> 00:45:45,661
I am not gonna tuck you in.

1500
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,700
这样我才睡得着

1501
00:45:45,696 --> 00:45:49,097
I... I promise I'll go right
to sleep.

1502
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:52,340
好吧

1503
00:45:51,268 --> 00:45:52,735
Fine.

1504
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:01,720
-塞紧点，塞紧点 -巴迪，停下来

1505
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,361
Tickle fight, tickle fight!
Buddy, stop.

1506
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,120
-塞紧点.塞… -停手！

1507
00:46:02,396 --> 00:46:04,514
Tickle fight. Tickle... stop
stop, stop.

1508
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,710
抱歉

1509
00:46:04,549 --> 00:46:06,106
Sorry.

1510
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:07,750
没关系

1511
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:08,151
It's all right.

1512
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,760
就这样躺着好好睡

1513
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:12,155
You just lay there and go to
sleep.

1514
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,830
好的

1515
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:13,468
Okay.

1516
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:14,350
好

1517
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,746
Okay.

1518
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:19,700
-爸爸？   -怎么？

1519
00:46:15,625 --> 00:46:18,556
Dad?

1520
00:46:18,591 --> 00:46:21,487
I love you.

1521
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,900
我爱你

1522
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,170
好.睡觉吧

1523
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,560
Okay. Go to sleep now.

1524
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:32,910
这真的很重要

1525
00:46:32,007 --> 00:46:33,273
Well, this is really something.

1526
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:37,250
早餐通常是我做的

1527
00:46:33,308 --> 00:46:37,642
I'm usually the one making
breakfast.

1528
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:41,280
好了，好了

1529
00:46:38,647 --> 00:46:41,673
That's good, that's good.

1530
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,250
行了

1531
00:46:43,018 --> 00:46:44,645
Okay.

1532
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,100
味道真不错

1533
00:46:51,792 --> 00:46:53,494
Oh, that's good.

1534
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,840
-不错吗？   -不错

1535
00:46:53,529 --> 00:46:55,229
Good? Good.

1536
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,170
不错

1537
00:46:55,264 --> 00:46:56,529
Good.

1538
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:59,140
那么，你…

1539
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:59,498
So, did you, um...

1540
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,840
你昨天睡的好吗？

1541
00:46:59,533 --> 00:47:01,135
Did you sleep okay last night?

1542
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,340
很好.我整整睡了40分钟

1543
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:02,702
Great. I got a full 40 minutes.

1544
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:05,640
还有时间做那摇摆木马

1545
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:06,036
And I had time to build that
rocking horse.

1546
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:09,850
哦，我的天！这真是你做的？

1547
00:47:06,173 --> 00:47:10,244
Uh, oh, my gosh. You actually
made that?

1548
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:12,650
你哪里来的木板？

1549
00:47:10,279 --> 00:47:13,042
Where did you get all the wood?

1550
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,730
-早上好，宝贝 -早上好，爸爸

1551
00:47:22,789 --> 00:47:25,675
Good morning, honey. Good
morning, dad.

1552
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:28,170
沃特，巴迪做了早餐

1553
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:28,561
Walter, buddy has made us
breakfast.

1554
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,140
是不是很好呢？

1555
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:30,530
Isn't that nice?

1556
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:31,640
还有午餐

1557
00:47:30,565 --> 00:47:32,349
And lunch.

1558
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,740
还有午餐

1559
00:47:32,384 --> 00:47:33,776
And lunch.

1560
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:34,780
拜拜

1561
00:47:33,811 --> 00:47:35,133
Bye.

1562
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:35,740
爸爸，你要吃多少？

1563
00:47:35,168 --> 00:47:36,101
So, dad, how many scoops?

1564
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:38,680
我先喝杯咖啡，谢谢

1565
00:47:36,136 --> 00:47:39,071
I'll stick with the coffee now,
thanks.

1566
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:41,780
爸爸…

1567
00:47:41,306 --> 00:47:42,139
So, dad...

1568
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,480
我计划好今天的事情

1569
00:47:42,174 --> 00:47:43,841
I planned out our whole day.

1570
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,690
首先 我们花两个小事来用雪堆天使

1571
00:47:43,876 --> 00:47:45,042
First, we'll make snow angels
for two hours,

1572
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:47,320
然后去溜冰，再以最快速度

1573
00:47:45,077 --> 00:47:47,713
And then we'll go ice skating
and then we'll eat a
whole roll

1574
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,390
吃一整团制甜酥饼干面团

1575
00:47:47,748 --> 00:47:49,782
Of tollhouse cookie dough as fast
as we can,

1576
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:51,730
最后 我们两个就偎依在一起

1577
00:47:49,817 --> 00:47:52,117
And then, to finish, we'll snuggle.

1578
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:54,430
我要上班，巴迪

1579
00:47:52,152 --> 00:47:54,820
I've got to go to work, buddy.

1580
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:55,660
还有件事…

1581
00:47:54,855 --> 00:47:56,020
Oh, and another thing...

1582
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,330
如果你要呆下来

1583
00:47:56,055 --> 00:47:57,856
If you're going to be staying
here,

1584
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:59,270
你要考虑…

1585
00:47:57,891 --> 00:47:59,658
You should think about, you know,

1586
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:00,970
把你这身装扮换了

1587
00:47:59,693 --> 00:48:01,325
Getting rid of the costume.

1588
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:02,340
但我一直都这样子穿的

1589
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,693
But I've worn this my whole life.

1590
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,470
你现在已不在北极了

1591
00:48:02,728 --> 00:48:05,863
You're not in the North Pole any
longer.

1592
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:07,780
你想让我开心，是不是？

1593
00:48:05,898 --> 00:48:08,166
You wanna make me happy, don't you?

1594
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:08,410
这是最重要的

1595
00:48:08,201 --> 00:48:08,765
More than anything.

1596
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:13,250
那么把带子解下来 越快越好

1597
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,638
Then, lose the tights. I mean,
as soon as possible.

1598
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:14,520
越快越好？

1599
00:48:13,673 --> 00:48:15,273
As soon as possible?

1600
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,480
越快越好

1601
00:48:15,308 --> 00:48:16,874
As soon as possible.

1602
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,880
好吧

1603
00:48:16,909 --> 00:48:18,273
Okay.

1604
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:20,880
我差点忘了

1605
00:48:20,078 --> 00:48:21,279
I almost forgot...

1606
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:27,420
早上好

1607
00:48:26,117 --> 00:48:27,811
Good morning.

1608
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:32,500
我是沃特

1609
00:48:32,289 --> 00:48:32,854
Walter here.

1610
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,800
接通了，是你啊

1611
00:48:32,889 --> 00:48:35,157
It worked, it's you.

1612
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,240
你怎么拨这号码的？

1613
00:48:35,192 --> 00:48:37,177
How'd you get this number?

1614
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,770
艾米丽留了个紧急呼叫单

1615
00:48:37,212 --> 00:48:39,162
Emily left an emergency list.

1616
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:39,410
我明白了

1617
00:48:39,197 --> 00:48:39,761
I see.

1618
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:41,400
有什么急事？

1619
00:48:39,796 --> 00:48:41,431
And, uh, is this an emergency?

1620
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,240
有个很可怕的声音

1621
00:48:41,466 --> 00:48:42,597
There's a horrible noise

1622
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,250
从窗户底下的箱子里发出

1623
00:48:42,632 --> 00:48:45,635
Coming from the evil
box underneath the window.

1624
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,540
听起来像是…

1625
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:46,937
It sounds like this...

1626
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:53,500
不是妖怪

1627
00:48:50,607 --> 00:48:53,442
It's, uh, it's... it's not evil,
buddy,

1628
00:48:53,477 --> 00:48:54,575
It's, uh, it's a radiator,

1629
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,220
是电暖炉

1630
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,600
散热时就发出声响

1631
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:56,445
And the heat makes noise when
it comes on.

1632
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,649
No, it doesn't. It... It's very
evil.

1633
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,860
好可怕啊

1634
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:02,430
面目狰狞啊

1635
00:48:59,684 --> 00:49:03,303
It's scary to look at. It's...
okay...

1636
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:06,530
等等，噢，没事了

1637
00:49:03,338 --> 00:49:06,922
I'm going toward... oh, wait.
Yes, it is.

1638
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:08,240
现在好了

1639
00:49:06,957 --> 00:49:08,624
Okay, it's okay. It's okay.

1640
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,370
一切安全

1641
00:49:08,659 --> 00:49:09,542
Everything's fine.

1642
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:10,400
你说得对

1643
00:49:09,577 --> 00:49:10,391
You were right.

1644
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,540
那我要挂线了

1645
00:49:10,426 --> 00:49:12,928
Okay, good, uh, I'm gonna hang
up now.

1646
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:13,410
我爱你

1647
00:49:12,963 --> 00:49:13,761
I love you.

1648
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:15,100
五分钟后给你电话

1649
00:49:13,796 --> 00:49:15,481
I'll call you in five minutes.

1650
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,780
巴迪

1651
00:49:15,516 --> 00:49:17,130
No, no, buddy, don't, uh...

1652
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,310
你不必给我电话

1653
00:49:17,165 --> 00:49:19,701
You... you don't have to call me,
okay?

1654
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:20,910
好主意，那你给我电话吧

1655
00:49:19,736 --> 00:49:21,267
Good idea, you call me.

1656
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:22,750
好，我要挂线了

1657
00:49:21,302 --> 00:49:23,103
Okay. I'm gonna hang up now.

1658
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,590
我学会了画蝴蝶

1659
00:49:23,138 --> 00:49:24,973
I painted a picture of a
butterfly.

1660
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:26,890
好样的，我要挂线了

1661
00:49:25,008 --> 00:49:27,275
Good. I'm gonna hang up now.

1662
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:28,760
我要调试钢琴了

1663
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,528
I tuned the piano.

1664
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,350
好，我爱你

1665
00:49:29,563 --> 00:49:31,746
Okay, I love you. Bye.

1666
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:55,280
-霍布斯   -嗨

1667
00:49:52,833 --> 00:49:55,666
Hobbs.

1668
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:57,200
你好，请坐

1669
00:49:55,936 --> 00:49:57,369
How you doing? Please, sit
down.

1670
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,320
很久不见

1671
00:49:57,404 --> 00:49:59,706
I haven't seen you since
the retreat.

1672
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,290
气色很好嘛

1673
00:49:59,741 --> 00:50:00,639
You're looking good.

1674
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:01,860
托赖，你也一样

1675
00:50:00,674 --> 00:50:02,092
Oh, thank you very much.
You as well.

1676
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,120
我该为此高兴吗？

1677
00:50:02,127 --> 00:50:03,475
To what do I owe the, uh,
pleasure?

1678
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,520
老实说，我侄女给我电话

1679
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:06,910
Well, to be honest, I got a call
from my niece.

1680
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:08,360
她想知道

1681
00:50:07,914 --> 00:50:08,713
She wants to know

1682
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,130
那小狗和鸽子

1683
00:50:08,748 --> 00:50:12,499
How a certain puppy and a
certain pigeon

1684
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:15,860
怎么会逃出巫婆的手心的

1685
00:50:12,534 --> 00:50:16,250
Escape the clutches of a
certain evil witch.

1686
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:17,970
听我说

1687
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:18,322
Believe me, uh,

1688
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:19,510
我们已经在寻觅新的画家

1689
00:50:18,357 --> 00:50:19,857
We're already looking for new
printers.

1690
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:21,110
这部作品是有点猫腻

1691
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:22,444
This one has obviously gotten a
little sloppy.

1692
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:24,610
不是画家耍猫腻吧

1693
00:50:22,479 --> 00:50:24,997
Maybe it isn't the printer who's
gotten sloppy.

1694
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:26,850
这是你的签名吗？

1695
00:50:25,032 --> 00:50:27,198
That's your signature, right?

1696
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:29,850
我们可以坐下来慢慢谈的

1697
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:30,235
You know, we could sit here and
point fingers all day.

1698
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:31,390
我说实话吧

1699
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:31,735
I've got news for you...

1700
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:33,920
即使那两页没被撕掉

1701
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:34,306
Even if those two pages were
in there,

1702
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,390
这本书依然是垃圾

1703
00:50:34,341 --> 00:50:35,739
The book still would have sucked.

1704
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:37,120
你知道这季度的业绩吗？

1705
00:50:35,774 --> 00:50:38,059
Have you seen the numbers for
this quarter?

1706
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,960
我们今天就准备让小狗和鸽子

1707
00:50:38,094 --> 00:50:40,345
Uh, they'll be here today. Oh,
they're in.

1708
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,860
重新出现在故事里面

1709
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,247
That frigging puppy and pigeon

1710
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,130
让它们受百般苦难

1711
00:50:42,282 --> 00:50:43,480
Are tanking hard, Hobbs.

1712
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:45,100
会计师预测

1713
00:50:43,515 --> 00:50:45,483
My people estimate we're
gonna post

1714
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,900
会损失百分之八的业绩

1715
00:50:45,518 --> 00:50:47,250
A minus eight for this quarter.

1716
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:50,140
不可能！

1717
00:50:47,285 --> 00:50:50,487
A minus eight! That does not
happen!

1718
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:52,610
我们会卷土重来的

1719
00:50:50,522 --> 00:50:52,991
You know, we'll... we'll bounce
back, we...

1720
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:54,400
-不   -不？嗯

1721
00:50:53,026 --> 00:50:54,776
No, no, no. No? Well...

1722
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,140
要发行新书

1723
00:50:54,811 --> 00:50:56,527
We're gonna ship a new book

1724
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,380
在第一季马上出版

1725
00:50:56,562 --> 00:50:57,929
The first quarter.

1726
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:58,910
第一季？

1727
00:50:57,964 --> 00:50:59,261
First quarter?

1728
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:01,380
我24号回来

1729
00:50:59,296 --> 00:51:01,915
I'm gonna be back in town on
the 24th.

1730
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:04,150
那时，我就要

1731
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:04,535
At that time, I would love
to hear

1732
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:05,950
听取你们的详细计划

1733
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:06,302
In exact detail

1734
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:09,150
看看你们能搞什么花样

1735
00:51:06,337 --> 00:51:09,534
What your plans are for this
new book.

1736
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:13,500
等等 24号不是圣诞前夕吗？

1737
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:13,437
Uh, wait a minute, the, uh
the 24th, that's Christmas
eve.

1738
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:15,900
那又如何？

1739
00:51:15,279 --> 00:51:16,245
And?

1740
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,870
嗯

1741
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,213
And, uh...

1742
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:20,890
没问题，到时给你惊喜

1743
00:51:18,248 --> 00:51:21,284
No problem. Be great to have
you in the loop.

1744
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,400
我取得了游戏里面 所有武器了

1745
00:51:24,387 --> 00:51:27,423
All right, I got every
weapon in the game.

1746
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,540
我获得最大体力值 全副武装

1747
00:51:27,458 --> 00:51:29,926
I got full health, I got full
armor.

1748
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:29,410
迈克尔

1749
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:30,550
我得到了…

1750
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:30,758
Michael!

1751
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:31,710
迈克尔！

1752
00:51:30,793 --> 00:51:31,928
I got full...

1753
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:33,680
是我啊

1754
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:33,061
Michael!

1755
00:51:33,096 --> 00:51:35,064
It's me buddy!

1756
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:35,180
你认识那小丑？

1757
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:37,690
不认识

1758
00:51:35,832 --> 00:51:36,531
You know that guy?

1759
00:51:36,566 --> 00:51:39,535
No, I've never seen him before.

1760
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:41,120
我是巴迪啊，好弟弟

1761
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:42,504
It's me buddy! Your brother!

1762
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,520
嗨

1763
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:47,120
迈克尔，等等，是我啊

1764
00:51:42,539 --> 00:51:43,870
Oh, man.

1765
00:51:43,905 --> 00:51:48,510
No, Michael! Wait! It's your
brother bud...

1766
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,690
对不起！

1767
00:51:49,444 --> 00:51:52,072
Sorry. Sorry! Horn honks

1768
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,700
迈克尔！

1769
00:51:52,781 --> 00:51:55,450
Michael! Michael!

1770
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:55,900
迈克尔！

1771
00:51:55,485 --> 00:51:57,251

1772
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,540
迈克尔！等等

1773
00:51:57,286 --> 00:51:59,621
Michael, wait up!

1774
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:00,580
迈克尔！

1775
00:51:59,656 --> 00:52:01,223
Michael! Michael!

1776
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,410
你走得真快

1777
00:52:01,258 --> 00:52:02,756
Wow, you're fast.

1778
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:03,800
终于赶上你了

1779
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:04,643
I'm gladi caught up with you.

1780
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,110
我等了五小时了

1781
00:52:04,678 --> 00:52:06,253
I waited five hours for you.

1782
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:06,450
你的大衣真够大的

1783
00:52:06,288 --> 00:52:07,793
Why is your coat so big?

1784
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:08,920
好消息 今天我看到一条小狗了

1785
00:52:07,828 --> 00:52:10,314
So, good news... I saw a dog
today.

1786
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,420
你看过小狗了吗？

1787
00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:12,800
Have you seen a dog?
You probably have.

1788
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,150
学校怎么样？好玩吗？

1789
00:52:12,835 --> 00:52:14,500
How was school? Was it fun?

1790
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:15,600
功课多吗？

1791
00:52:14,535 --> 00:52:16,437
Did you get a lot of
homework, huh?

1792
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,220
你的朋友呢？

1793
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:17,560
好朋友是谁啊？

1794
00:52:16,472 --> 00:52:17,705
Do you have any friends?

1795
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,260
他也有大衣的吗？

1796
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,190
Do you have a best friend?

1797
00:52:19,225 --> 00:52:20,641
Does he have a big coat, too?

1798
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,730
走开！

1799
00:52:20,676 --> 00:52:22,108
Go away!

1800
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:26,230
去你的笨蛋！

1801
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:27,607
Ow! Son of a nutcracker!

1802
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:30,500
跑啊！

1803
00:52:30,451 --> 00:52:31,883
Run!

1804
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:34,430
抓住那绿色小丑

1805
00:52:32,352 --> 00:52:35,822
Get him! Get the
green guy!

1806
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:44,190
来者不善

1807
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:45,565
Oh, no. These guys are bad news.

1808
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:46,780
我们最好快逃

1809
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,159
We better get outta here.

1810
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,630
为何不还击呢？

1811
00:52:49,469 --> 00:52:51,970
You know what? We can take 'em.

1812
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:54,620
快点堆雪球

1813
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:55,997
Okay, just start making as
many snowballs as you can.

1814
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,140
准备好了吗？

1815
00:53:03,115 --> 00:53:05,515
You ready?

1816
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,870
来吧

1817
00:53:06,452 --> 00:53:09,250
Let's go.

1818
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,180
跑

1819
00:53:16,695 --> 00:53:18,560
Run!

1820
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:28,000
让他逃走了

1821
00:53:26,571 --> 00:53:29,374
Oh, man. One got away.

1822
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,290
雪球

1823
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:30,671
Snowball.

1824
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,100
你到底从哪里来的？

1825
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:46,386
Where did you say you were from?

1826
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,200
蜡烛星光点点

1827
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,623
Oh, yeah

1828
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:51,361
Candles burning low

1829
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,690
饰物点缀

1830
00:53:51,396 --> 00:53:54,029
Lots of mistletoe

1831
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:58,530
到处冰雪覆盖

1832
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:59,868
Lots of snow and ice everywhere
we go

1833
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:04,700
唱诗班哼着赞歌

1834
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:05,442
Choirs singing carols right
outside my door

1835
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,330
增加着圣诞的气氛

1836
00:54:05,477 --> 00:54:07,445
All these things and more

1837
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,400
但愿爸爸来了就好

1838
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,412
I wish dad were here.

1839
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:12,270
他是世上最棒的爸爸

1840
00:54:08,400 --> 01:48:16,740
怎么了？

1841
00:54:09,447 --> 00:54:09,677
Why?

1842
00:54:09,712 --> 00:54:13,649
'Cause he's the greatest dad in
the whole wide world.

1843
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:13,140
不是吧

1844
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:15,710
他一点都不称职

1845
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:14,482
Are you kidding?

1846
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:17,086
He's the worst dad in the world.

1847
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,500
什么意思？

1848
00:54:17,121 --> 00:54:18,888
What do you mean?

1849
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,280
他只知道工作

1850
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:20,656
All he does is work.

1851
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,720
工作很有趣啊

1852
00:54:20,691 --> 00:54:22,056
Working's fun.

1853
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,750
他可不这样想

1854
00:54:22,091 --> 00:54:24,091
Not the way he does it.

1855
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:23,790
他在乎的是钱

1856
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:27,890
不在乎你我，或者其他人

1857
00:54:24,126 --> 00:54:25,126
All he cares about is money.

1858
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:29,265
He doesn't care about you,
or me, or anybody.

1859
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,720
那他会被列入黑名单的

1860
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:32,097
Well, he is on the naughty list.

1861
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,100
你喜欢她？

1862
00:54:36,738 --> 00:54:38,601
You like her?

1863
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,900
谁？

1864
00:54:38,636 --> 00:54:40,464
Like who?

1865
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:41,100
你望着的那位女孩

1866
00:54:40,608 --> 00:54:42,477
The girl you're staring at.

1867
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,770
嗯

1868
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:44,261
Oh, uh...

1869
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:44,640
是的

1870
00:54:44,296 --> 00:54:46,010
Yeah.

1871
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:48,800
约她出来嘛

1872
00:54:47,282 --> 00:54:49,451
Why don't you ask her out?

1873
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,800
出来？

1874
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:50,417
Out?

1875
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,180
约会啊，吃饭啊

1876
00:54:50,452 --> 00:54:53,555
You know, on a date...
to eat food.

1877
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,800
吃饭？

1878
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:54,421
Food?

1879
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,850
对，吃饭，不是吃糖果

1880
00:54:54,456 --> 00:54:57,189
Yes, real food, not candy.

1881
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:57,890
她若是答应了 你就有戏了

1882
00:54:57,224 --> 00:54:59,874
And if she says yes,
you're in.

1883
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:01,150
女孩都喜欢吃

1884
00:54:59,909 --> 00:55:02,524
It's like a secret code
girls have.

1885
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,760
谁大驾光临啊

1886
00:55:04,131 --> 00:55:06,133
Well, look who it is.

1887
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,890
乔维，你好

1888
00:55:06,168 --> 00:55:09,261
Hi, Jovie. Hi.

1889
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:11,630
这位是迈克尔

1890
00:55:11,238 --> 00:55:13,006
Oh, uh, this is Michael.

1891
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:13,260
我是他弟弟

1892
00:55:13,041 --> 00:55:14,633
I'm his brother.

1893
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,270
你好

1894
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,110
你们在这干嘛？

1895
00:55:15,609 --> 00:55:16,608
Hi.

1896
00:55:16,643 --> 00:55:18,444
So, what are you doing here?

1897
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:19,410
金宝让你回去工作了吗？

1898
00:55:18,479 --> 00:55:21,063
Did gimbel's give you your
job back?

1899
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:22,280
不是，但现在一切都好

1900
00:55:21,098 --> 00:55:23,649
No. But things worked out
pretty good.

1901
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,340
他们让我等消息

1902
00:55:23,684 --> 00:55:25,708
They gave mea restraining
order.

1903
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:28,400
你不该留在这里的

1904
00:55:25,818 --> 00:55:29,789
Well, um, you should probably
get outta here.

1905
00:55:29,824 --> 00:55:32,690
Ho ho ho!

1906
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:33,620
但我想见你

1907
00:55:32,725 --> 00:55:34,959
But... I really wanted to
see you,

1908
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:37,690
觉得你很美，而我…

1909
00:55:34,994 --> 00:55:39,065
And... and I think you're
beautiful, and I, um...

1910
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:41,160
在你身旁，我感觉温暖

1911
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:42,535
I feel really warm when I
am around you,

1912
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:45,460
舌头打结了

1913
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:46,834
And, um, my tongue swells up.

1914
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,670
那么

1915
00:55:50,809 --> 00:55:53,039
So...

1916
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:54,170
可以一起吃饭吗？

1917
00:55:53,345 --> 00:55:55,540
Do you wanna go eat food?

1918
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,150
吃饭？

1919
00:55:56,214 --> 00:55:58,517
Do I... do I wanna eat food?

1920
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:58,150
嗯

1921
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:03,450
你知道的，吃东西嘛

1922
00:55:59,518 --> 00:56:04,820
You know, uh, the code... food.

1923
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:08,310
我刚吃过午饭了

1924
00:56:06,558 --> 00:56:09,685
Well, I just had my lunch
break.

1925
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:11,360
我懂了

1926
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:12,879
Oh, okay. I understand.

1927
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:14,330
但周四有空

1928
00:56:12,914 --> 00:56:15,699
But I'm free on Thursday.

1929
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,800
周四！

1930
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,133
Thursday! Thursday!

1931
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,970
天啊，有戏了

1932
00:56:18,168 --> 00:56:20,337
Come on. That'd be great.

1933
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:19,970
好的

1934
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:21,740
这样可以吗？

1935
00:56:20,372 --> 00:56:21,303
All right.

1936
00:56:21,338 --> 00:56:23,072
Was that okay?

1937
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:24,360
干得好

1938
00:56:23,107 --> 00:56:25,735
You did great, man.

1939
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:26,240
首先要挂上什么东西？

1940
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,940
-彩灯   -好的

1941
00:56:26,243 --> 00:56:27,611
What should we put on it
first?

1942
00:56:27,646 --> 00:56:28,996
Lights! Oh, good.

1943
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:28,980
然后呢？

1944
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:31,840
-装饰品   -好的

1945
00:56:29,031 --> 00:56:30,312
And then, after that?

1946
00:56:30,347 --> 00:56:33,214
Ornaments! Ornaments, okay.

1947
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:34,350
在搞什么鬼啊

1948
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:35,683
What the hell's that?

1949
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:36,180
圣诞树

1950
00:56:35,718 --> 00:56:36,986
A Christmas tree.

1951
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:36,880
圣诞树？

1952
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,100
巴迪在公园里砍下来的

1953
00:56:37,021 --> 00:56:38,219
A Christmas tree?

1954
00:56:38,254 --> 00:56:41,382
Buddy chopped it down in
the park.

1955
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:42,260
艾米丽

1956
00:56:42,158 --> 00:56:43,591
Emily.

1957
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:44,860
你干嘛小题大做

1958
00:56:43,626 --> 00:56:46,229
I don't know what you're making
such a big deal about.

1959
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:47,330
他们只是找点乐趣而已

1960
00:56:46,264 --> 00:56:48,265
They were just having a
little fun.

1961
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:48,900
乐趣？犯罪也能带来乐趣吗？

1962
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,231
Oh, fun? So felonies are
fun now?

1963
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,700
我懂你的意思

1964
00:56:50,266 --> 00:56:53,069
I thought, see, felonies
were felonies.

1965
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,700
那棵树是不应该砍

1966
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,000
我会让他种上另一棵的

1967
00:56:53,104 --> 00:56:54,035
Okay, the tree thing was bad.

1968
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,740
但至少迈克尔玩得很高兴啊

1969
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:55,336
I'll get him to plant
another one.

1970
00:56:55,371 --> 00:56:57,973
But at least Michael is
happy for once.

1971
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:59,210
什么意思？

1972
00:56:58,008 --> 00:57:00,541
What, uh, what's that supposed
to mean?

1973
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:01,340
我也不瞒你说

1974
00:57:00,576 --> 00:57:02,878
Well, I don't think it's any
secret, Walter,

1975
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:03,810
你根本就没关心过孩子

1976
00:57:02,913 --> 00:57:05,180
That you haven't exactly been
there for him.

1977
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:05,410
好啊

1978
00:57:05,215 --> 00:57:07,149
I'll tell you what, why don't
we just

1979
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:09,500
那干脆让他辍学 跟着那精灵算了

1980
00:57:07,184 --> 00:57:09,084
Pull him outta school and let
the, uh,

1981
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,384
Deranged elf man raise him?

1982
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,890
然后就可以越快乐越堕落了

1983
00:57:10,419 --> 00:57:13,255
Then they can have lots of
fun committing felonies.

1984
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:14,960
把星星放到树顶吧

1985
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:16,325
How are we gonna get the star
on top?

1986
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,510
知道了

1987
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,883
I got it.

1988
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,570
还有什么法子？

1989
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:31,740
不能把他独自丢在这里

1990
00:57:29,804 --> 00:57:30,903
I mean, what are we gonna do?

1991
00:57:30,938 --> 00:57:33,107
We can't... we can't leave him
alone here.

1992
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,260
会毁了房子的

1993
00:57:33,142 --> 00:57:35,632
He's gonna destroy the place.

1994
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:37,400
为何你…

1995
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,380
你明天请假如何？

1996
00:57:37,678 --> 00:57:38,377
Why don't you, um...

1997
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:40,580
就可以在屋里照顾他了

1998
00:57:38,412 --> 00:57:39,712
Why don't you take off tomorrow?

1999
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,949
You know, and you could stay
home and watch him?

2000
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:42,920
明天不能请假

2001
00:57:41,984 --> 00:57:44,285
Oh, no. No, I can't stay home
tomorrow,

2002
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,420
要开会讨论预算的问题

2003
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,637
I have a budget meeting tomorrow.

2004
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:45,590
我也不能请假

2005
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:49,900
现在我面临着被解雇的风险

2006
00:57:45,672 --> 00:57:47,546
Well, honey, I can't take off,

2007
00:57:47,581 --> 00:57:49,019
I'm one... one bad pitch away

2008
00:57:49,054 --> 00:57:50,422
From getting fired... one.

2009
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:50,990
那有什么办法呢？

2010
00:57:50,457 --> 00:57:53,376
Well, I tell you what, I have
an idea then.

2011
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:54,930
那你带着他上班吧

2012
00:57:53,411 --> 00:57:56,295
Why don't you take buddy to
work with you?

2013
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,440
-嗨，沃特   -早安，杰克

2014
00:58:03,637 --> 00:58:05,805

Good morning, Sarah. Good
morning, Sarah.

2021
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,310
这条紫色裙子很美

2022
00:58:10,644 --> 00:58:13,679
That's a nice purple dress.
It's very purple-y

2023
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:13,810
-弗兰西斯科 -你好，霍布斯先生

2024
00:58:13,714 --> 00:58:15,145
Francisco. How's it going, Mr.
Hobbs?

2025
00:58:13,810 --> 00:58:17,910
弗兰西斯科，多有趣的名字

2026
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:19,284
Francisco, that's fun to say..."
Francisco."

2027
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:20,390
你好

2028
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:21,320
记得我吗？

2029
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:21,719
Hi! Hi.

2030
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,460
记得，但一时认不出你了

2031
00:58:21,754 --> 00:58:22,653
Do you remember me?

2032
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:25,150
当然了，我穿了工作服

2033
00:58:22,688 --> 00:58:24,603
I do. I didn't recognize you.

2034
00:58:24,638 --> 00:58:26,518
I know, I'm in work clothes.

2035
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,670
谢谢，迪波拉

2036

谢谢

2038
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:32,930
迪波拉，你真是迷人

2039
00:58:32,066 --> 00:58:33,063
Thanks, deb.

2040
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:34,470
该把你的头像 印刷到圣诞卡上面

2041
00:58:33,098 --> 00:58:34,466
Deb, you have such a pretty face.

2042
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:36,940
你真把我捧上天了

2043
00:58:34,501 --> 00:58:35,833
You should be on a Christmas card.

2044
00:58:35,868 --> 00:58:38,301
You just made my day.

2045
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:50,220
巴迪

2046
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,190
不喜欢就别喝了

2047
00:58:50,348 --> 00:58:51,547
Buddy.

2048
00:58:51,582 --> 00:58:53,551
You don't have to drink that.

2049
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:53,710
谢谢

2050
00:58:53,586 --> 00:58:55,075
Thank you.

2051
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:05,820
弗兰西斯科

2052
00:59:05,195 --> 00:59:07,186
Francisco.

2053
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:09,490
弗兰西斯科

2054
00:59:08,331 --> 00:59:10,856
Francisco.

2055
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:13,210
弗兰西斯科

2056
00:59:12,169 --> 00:59:13,954
Francisco.

2057
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:14,380
弗兰西斯科

2058
00:59:13,989 --> 00:59:15,597
Francisco.

2059
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,840
巴迪？

2060
00:59:15,632 --> 00:59:17,206
Buddy?

2061
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,180
我念得太大声了吗？

2062
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,510
有点

2063
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:21,210
对不起

2064
00:59:19,543 --> 00:59:20,877
Just... just a little.

2065
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:27,820
怎么了？

2066
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:30,490
桌上怎么有你的名字？

2067
00:59:28,551 --> 00:59:29,150
Yes, bud?

2068
00:59:29,185 --> 00:59:31,854
Why is your name on the desk?

2069
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:32,690
桌子是我买的

2070
00:59:31,889 --> 00:59:34,021
I bought the desk.

2071
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:35,490
写上名字以防被盗

2072
00:59:34,056 --> 00:59:36,854
My name's there so no one
steals it.

2073
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:38,800
爸爸，你在开玩笑吧？

2074
00:59:38,694 --> 00:59:40,512
That's a joke, isn't it, dad?

2075
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,970
是的，是玩笑

2076
00:59:40,547 --> 00:59:43,141
Yeah, buddy, that's a joke.

2077
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:44,370
我们要制造点什么呢？

2078
00:59:43,176 --> 00:59:45,735
So, what are we gonna build?

2079
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:45,740
在这里

2080
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:47,470
我们不需动手制造什么东西

2081
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:47,068
No, uh, we don't do

2082
00:59:47,103 --> 00:59:48,837
That kind of work here, pal.

2083
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,980
我是精灵巴迪 你最喜欢什么颜色？

2084
00:59:50,071 --> 00:59:52,340
Buddy the elf, what's your
favorite color?

2085
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:52,380
放下来，喂？

2086
00:59:52,375 --> 00:59:53,742
Put that down. Hello?

2087
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,750
喂？

2088
00:59:53,777 --> 00:59:56,108
Hello? Dial tone

2089
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,520
不要碰其他东西

2090
00:59:57,378 --> 00:59:59,881
Please, don't touch anything.

2091
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,990
对不起

2092
00:59:59,916 --> 01:00:01,348
Sorry.

2093
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,820
嗨

2094
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,800
巴迪，你看过

2095
01:00:07,922 --> 01:00:10,024
Bud, have you... have you...

2096
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,770
邮件收发室吗？

2097
01:00:10,059 --> 01:00:12,127
Have you ever seen a mailroom?

2098
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:12,000
邮件收发室？

2099
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,230
没见过？

2100
01:00:12,161 --> 01:00:13,360
A mailroom? No.

2101
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:14,700
天啊

2102
01:00:13,395 --> 01:00:14,560
No? No.

2103
01:00:14,595 --> 01:00:15,394
Oh, I mean, wow.

2104
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,800
那个地方

2105
01:00:15,429 --> 01:00:18,165
Wow... listen, it's a
place where mail

2106
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:17,840
能收到世界各地的东西

2107
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,540
然后在那里分类

2108
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,164
From all over the world
comes,

2109
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:21,902
Uh-huh. And they sort it
out there, see?

2110
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:21,540
你能触摸到各种不同的邮件

2111
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:23,380
放到闪亮的盒子里面

2112
01:00:21,937 --> 01:00:22,868
And you can touch it all,

2113
01:00:22,903 --> 01:00:24,738
And they put it in these
shiny bins.

2114
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:24,910
闪亮的盒子？

2115
01:00:24,773 --> 01:00:26,238
Shiny bins? Right.

2116
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:27,420
觉得很好玩吧

2117
01:00:26,273 --> 01:00:28,776
What do ya think? It
sounds great.

2118
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:28,480
太好了

2119
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,980
我们到哪里，如何？

2120
01:00:28,811 --> 01:00:29,808
Good.

2121
01:00:29,843 --> 01:00:31,345
Can we go there?

2122
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:30,790
嗯

2123
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:33,990
我得在这上班 你到哪里玩耍吧

2124
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:32,111
Well, um...

2125
01:00:32,146 --> 01:00:35,349
I gotta work here, maybe... maybe
you can work there.

2126
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:35,290
好的，我自己过去

2127
01:00:35,384 --> 01:00:36,649
Okay, I'll work there.

2128
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:41,330
这不是爸爸提及的地方

2129
01:00:39,185 --> 01:00:41,387
Oh, I don't think this is
the place

2130
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:42,830
有别的邮件收发室吗？

2131
01:00:41,422 --> 01:00:42,653
My dad was talking about.

2132
01:00:42,688 --> 01:00:44,190
Is there a different mailroom?

2133
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:45,700
只此一家

2134
01:00:44,225 --> 01:00:46,425
No. This is the only one.

2135
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,300
一点都不闪亮

2136
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:48,655
It's not very shiny.

2137
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:51,440
这里是管道

2138
01:00:48,761 --> 01:00:52,764
Now... over here's the trench.

2139
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,570
邮件从发射台送过来

2140
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:54,899
All the mail comes out that
shooter.

2141
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:58,980
把邮件分类 放到不同的罐子里面

2142
01:00:54,934 --> 01:00:59,338
Scan and find the floor each
piece is moving to.

2143
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:02,580
然后把罐子堆放到 同一地区的管道

2144
01:00:59,373 --> 01:01:00,304
Put it in a canister

2145
01:01:00,339 --> 01:01:03,942
And shove it up the tube with
the same number.

2146
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:04,450
懂吗？

2147
01:01:03,977 --> 01:01:05,394
You got that?

2148
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:05,450
大概懂了

2149
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:06,777
I think so.

2150
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:08,420
这让我想起了 圣诞老人的工作室

2151
01:01:06,812 --> 01:01:09,781
This place reminds me of
Santa's workshop.

2152
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:09,990
但这里有着汽油味道

2153
01:01:09,816 --> 01:01:11,314
Except it smells like mushrooms,

2154
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:13,200
而且大家都似乎很凶

2155
01:01:11,349 --> 01:01:14,375
And everyone looks like they
wanna hurt me.

2156
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:15,300
格林威先生明天就回来了

2157
01:01:14,653 --> 01:01:16,655
Uh, greenway's coming in tomorrow,

2158
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,930
有什么好办法？

2159
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:18,255
So, what... what do we got?

2160
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:18,970
莫里斯和我经过了头脑风暴法

2161
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:20,325
Well, Morris and I have been
brainstorming,

2162
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:21,440
终于想到了

2163
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,794
And we've come up with what I
think

2164
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,870
一个伟大的主意

2165
01:01:22,829 --> 01:01:24,229
Is a pretty big idea.

2166
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:23,400
什么主意？

2167
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,940
你肯定喜欢的

2168
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:24,728
Great, what?

2169
01:01:24,763 --> 01:01:27,298
You're gonna love it, it's
fantastic.

2170
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:26,940
到底是什么？

2171
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:29,640
简单说来

2172
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:28,264
What?

2173
01:01:28,299 --> 01:01:31,601
Okay, picture this...

2174
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:33,550
我们可以请迈尔斯.芬奇过来

2175
01:01:31,636 --> 01:01:34,903
We bring in miles finch.

2176
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:36,380
迈尔斯.芬奇？

2177
01:01:35,806 --> 01:01:37,391
The miles finch?

2178
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:37,620
的作者

2179
01:01:37,426 --> 01:01:38,635
The golden ghost.

2180
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:38,490
请他过来

2181
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:41,360
他比苏斯博士 更能创作经典故事

2182
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:39,809
We bring him in!

2183
01:01:39,844 --> 01:01:42,713
He's written more classics than dr.
Seuss.

2184
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,390
但这也不容易

2185
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:44,200
但值得一试

2186
01:01:42,748 --> 01:01:43,712
I tain't gonna be easy,

2187
01:01:43,747 --> 01:01:45,347
But I think it's worth a shot.

2188
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:48,660
我的两位左右手 团队合作者

2189
01:01:45,382 --> 01:01:50,019
My two top writers, my crack team,
my fun squad...

2190
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:52,900
来到这里 竟然让我另请高明？

2191
01:01:50,054 --> 01:01:51,686
You came in here pitching me

2192
01:01:51,721 --> 01:01:54,257
The idea of hiring another writer?

2193
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,000
是的

2194
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,160
迈尔斯.芬奇

2195
01:01:54,292 --> 01:01:55,323
Yeah.

2196
01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:57,519
Miles finch.

2197
01:01:58,870 --> 01:02:01,400
我喜欢

2198
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:02,755
I like it. Chuckles

2199
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:03,540
我喜欢

2200
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:06,610
我在糖果森林连闯七关

2201
01:02:03,933 --> 01:02:04,866
I like it.

2202
01:02:04,901 --> 01:02:06,970
Then I traveled through the seven
levels

2203
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:10,890
然后到达水果糖的海洋

2204
01:02:07,005 --> 01:02:07,936
Of the candy cane forest

2205
01:02:07,971 --> 01:02:12,242
And past the sea of swirly-twirly
gumdrops.

2206
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:13,390
啊

2207
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:16,460
这东西好好玩

2208
01:02:14,743 --> 01:02:17,778
Wow... it's sucky.

2209
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:19,360
太棒了

2210
01:02:17,813 --> 01:02:20,265
Ohh, it's wonderful. Yes!

2211
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,360
非常美妙

2212
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,718
That is marvelous how that...

2213
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,160
啊

2214
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,500
能吸引东西的

2215
01:02:24,519 --> 01:02:27,038
Oh, it's very sucky.

2216
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,200
吸力特强

2217
01:02:27,073 --> 01:02:29,558
It's very... sucky.

2218
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:31,410
你怎会到这里工作的？

2219
01:02:30,893 --> 01:02:32,761
So, how'd you get here?

2220
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:32,870
劳改啊

2221
01:02:32,796 --> 01:02:34,229
Work release.

2222
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:34,100
嗯

2223
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,580
果汁咖啡吗？

2224
01:02:35,364 --> 01:02:37,898
Oh, syrup and coffee?

2225
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:39,880
我能尝尝吗？

2226
01:02:37,932 --> 01:02:41,235
Why didn't I think of that? Can I
try some?

2227
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,500
随便

2228
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:42,368
Be my guest.

2229
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:42,550
你真好人

2230
01:02:42,403 --> 01:02:43,870
Very generous of you.

2231
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:46,950
我喜欢果汁

2232
01:02:43,905 --> 01:02:48,308
Mmm. I love syrup.

2233
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,150
爱死了

2234
01:02:50,311 --> 01:02:52,506
Ohh, I love it.

2235
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:54,400
嗯

2236
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,200
虽然我们初次见面

2237
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:58,552
You know, I know I sound like a
broken record,

2238
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,200
但我们是好朋友

2239
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,430
最好的朋友

2240
01:02:58,587 --> 01:02:59,518
But we are buddies.

2241
01:02:59,553 --> 01:03:01,789
You're my best friend, that's it.

2242
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:01,200
最好的朋友

2243
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,900
这里没人愿意听我的话

2244
01:03:01,824 --> 01:03:02,520
You're my best friend.

2245
01:03:02,555 --> 01:03:05,258
You know, buddy, nobody around
here listens to me.

2246
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,700
但我是有想法的认

2247
01:03:05,293 --> 01:03:07,427
I got really good ideas. Yeah?
I believe it.

2248
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,110
我知道啊，在听呢

2249
01:03:07,462 --> 01:03:09,462
I know, I'm right, I listen to you.

2250
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:09,800
你有伟大的想法

2251
01:03:09,497 --> 01:03:10,395
You have great ideas.

2252
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:10,980
我尝试适应现在安逸的生活

2253
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:12,332
I just try to go with the flow,
you know?

2254
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:12,150
适应安逸的生活

2255
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:13,250
是啊

2256
01:03:12,367 --> 01:03:13,484
Good, you go with the flow.

2257
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:15,500
但天降大任 必先苦其心智，劳其筋骨

2258
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:14,566
Yeah. Go with the flow.

2259
01:03:14,601 --> 01:03:15,985
No, I gotta get out of the flow.

2260
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,200
苦其心智，劳其筋骨

2261
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:17,335
Well, then get out of the flow.

2262
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,220
所以现在我无所事事

2263
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:20,650
我都26岁，一事无成

2264
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:18,536
I'm in the flow, that's what got
me here.

2265
01:03:18,571 --> 01:03:22,008
I gotta... I'm 26 years old, I got
nothing to show for it.

2266
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:22,650
你还年轻啊

2267
01:03:22,043 --> 01:03:24,010
You're young. You're so young.

2268
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:24,460
-我爸爸   -怎么了？

2269
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:29,900
直到490岁才学会做手工呢

2270
01:03:24,978 --> 01:03:25,777
My papa... yeah?

2271
01:03:25,812 --> 01:03:30,449
He didn't make master tinker till
he was 490,so...

2272
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:33,700
-490岁？   -是啊

2273
01:03:33,319 --> 01:03:35,054
Four-hundred and ninety? Yeah.

2274
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,440
看我怎么给你搔痒

2275
01:03:36,555 --> 01:03:39,057
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!

2276
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,210
看我怎么给你搔痒

2277
01:03:39,092 --> 01:03:41,525
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!

2278
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:43,710
年度我最喜欢的书 就是您的作品

2279
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:45,064
My favorite book of yours has
gotta be Gus' pickles.

2280
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:47,550
通俗易懂

2281
01:03:45,099 --> 01:03:48,284
It's existential, yet it's so
accessible.

2282
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:50,120
芬奇先生 我是尤金.度普里斯

2283
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:51,211
Uh, Mr. Finch, uh, Eugene Dupris
here.

2284
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:53,990
和你谈话真是我的荣幸

2285
01:03:51,246 --> 01:03:54,105
It's a thrill just to be talking
to you

2286
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:56,990
迈尔斯 你能明天过来一趟吗？

2287
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:55,305
On our speakerphone.

2288
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:57,375
Miles, um, so, what do you think?

2289
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:59,260
我给你们五个小时

2290
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:58,308
Can you fly in tomorrow?

2291
01:03:58,343 --> 01:04:00,611
I'll give you five hours tomorrow,

2292
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:00,490
一分钟不多

2293
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:01,560
太好了

2294
01:04:00,646 --> 01:04:01,811
Not a minute more.

2295
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:05,200
接待我的人要穿黑色衣服

2296
01:04:01,846 --> 01:04:02,879
Oh, that's... that's great.

2297
01:04:02,914 --> 01:04:06,551
I'd like a black s500to receive
me at the airport.

2298
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,000
车子里面也要黑色的

2299
01:04:06,586 --> 01:04:08,353
I need the interior of that car

2300
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,400
七点一刻

2301
01:04:08,388 --> 01:04:10,353
To be 71 degrees exactly.

2302
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,400
-可以的   -霍布斯先生？

2303
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:12,123
We can do that.
Mr. Hobbs?

2304
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,510
楼下有异样

2305
01:04:12,158 --> 01:04:13,858
There's a situation downstairs.

2306
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:13,740
你说什么？

2307
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:14,980
请稍等 迈尔斯，Deb，你先挂线

2308
01:04:13,893 --> 01:04:15,058
I'm sorry, what?

2309
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:17,140
不要让我久等

2310
01:04:15,092 --> 01:04:16,291
No, hold on, miles. Deb, hang up.

2311
01:04:16,326 --> 01:04:18,460
I do not hold. Do not put
me on hold.

2312
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:19,750
邮件收发室出乱子了

2313
01:04:18,495 --> 01:04:21,098
We have a problem in the
mailroom.

2314
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:20,650
怎么了？

2315
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:21,680
不要再说了 迪波拉，挂线吧

2316
01:04:21,133 --> 01:04:21,964
What's going on?

2317
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,650
-我要挂线了   -迈尔斯

2318
01:04:21,999 --> 01:04:24,000
Don't speak... Deborah, hang up!

2319
01:04:24,035 --> 01:04:26,002
That's it, I'm gone. Miles!

2320
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,520
记住了，明天七点一刻

2321
01:04:28,872 --> 01:04:31,458
I'll be there tomorrow... 71
degrees.

2322
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:34,260
收发室负责任要和你谈谈

2323
01:04:31,493 --> 01:04:34,044
Sir, chuck in the mailroom

2324
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:35,546
Needs to talk to you.

2325
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:35,660
怎么回事？

2326
01:04:35,581 --> 01:04:36,979
Chuck... what, chuck?

2327
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:37,200
楼下会发生什么事呢？

2328
01:04:37,014 --> 01:04:38,513
I mean, what could be going on
down there

2329
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,230
值得你中途扰乱我的计划？

2330
01:04:38,548 --> 01:04:40,583
That's so important you had to
interrupt me, what?

2331
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:41,400
太棒了，再大声点

2332
01:04:40,618 --> 01:04:42,519
Whoomp, there it is! A little
louder

2333
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,700
太棒了，来吧

2334
01:04:42,554 --> 01:04:44,420

01:04:44,455 --> 01:04:46,320
Whoomp! There it is

2337
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,510
翻来覆去

2338
01:04:46,355 --> 01:04:47,756
Upside down and inside out hey!

2339
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:47,810
我要让你们见识见识

2340
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:49,158
I'm 'bout to show all you folks

2341
01:04:47,810 --> 01:04:49,280
到底什么叫做厉害

2342
01:04:49,193 --> 01:04:50,591
What it's all about hey!

2343
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,510
给我来发言了

2344
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:52,500
让大家狂欢

2345
01:04:50,626 --> 01:04:51,826
Time for me to get on the mike

2346
01:04:51,861 --> 01:04:53,429
And make this mother of a party
hype

2347
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:53,650
让我带你回去过去的时光

2348
01:04:53,464 --> 01:04:55,081
I'm taking you back to the old
school

2349
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:55,350
我喜欢怀缅，而且不善言辞

2350
01:04:55,116 --> 01:04:56,664
'cause I'm an old fool who's so cool

2351
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,150
请坐下吧，我告诉你怎么走

2352
01:04:56,699 --> 01:04:58,501
If you wanna get down, I'm gonna
show you the way

2353
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:59,290
太棒了，请继续发言吧

2354
01:04:58,536 --> 01:05:00,636

2364
01:05:11,012 --> 01:05:11,479
Coming.

2365
01:05:15,770 --> 01:05:17,200
你好

2366
01:05:17,118 --> 01:05:18,536
Hi.

2367
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,610
哇

2368
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:20,340
你真漂亮

2369
01:05:19,954 --> 01:05:21,689
You look miraculous.

2370
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:21,840
你也是

2371
01:05:21,724 --> 01:05:23,058
So do you.

2372
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,400
谢谢

2373
01:05:23,093 --> 01:05:24,357
Thank you.

2374
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,500
有什么节目？

2375
01:05:24,392 --> 01:05:26,394
What would you like to do?

2376
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,140
跟我来

2377
01:05:26,429 --> 01:05:28,486
I got some ideas.

2378
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:35,160
伸出手拿着，然后尝一口

2379
01:05:32,566 --> 01:05:36,503
Just reach out in front of you and
and take a sip.

2380
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:38,610
不要偷看

2381
01:05:36,538 --> 01:05:39,961
Don't look. There you go.

2382
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:42,230
嗯

2383
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:43,576
Well?

2384
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,300
好像普通的咖啡

2385
01:05:43,944 --> 01:05:46,647
It tastes like a crappy cup
of coffee.

2386
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:47,560
不是

2387
01:05:46,682 --> 01:05:48,911
No.

2388
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:50,870
就是普通的咖啡嘛

2389
01:05:50,484 --> 01:05:52,184
It is a crappy cup of coffee.

2390
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:53,370
是世上最好的咖啡

2391
01:05:52,219 --> 01:05:54,685
No, it's the world's best cup
of coffee.

2392
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:57,110
只要不被门夹着手就可以了

2393
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:58,458
The trick is to not get your arm caught
in the door!

2394
01:05:57,110 --> 01:06:00,650
也不要闭上眼睛 否则会头晕的

2395
01:05:58,493 --> 01:06:01,959
Also, never close your eyes' cause
then

2396
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:04,320
你觉得好玩就过来吧

2397
01:06:01,994 --> 01:06:05,665
Okay, when you feel comfortable, you
just jump in!

2398
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,900
你在干嘛？

2399
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,398
What are you doing?

2400
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:09,860
我在跳跃啊

2401
01:06:07,433 --> 01:06:10,486
I'm skipping. I'm skipping.
I'm skipping.

2402
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:12,190
等等，再来

2403
01:06:10,521 --> 01:06:13,539
Wait, wait, wait... one more, one more.

2404
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:14,890
多大的圣诞树啊

2405
01:06:13,574 --> 01:06:16,235
Now, look at the size of this one.

2406
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,270
跟我来

2407
01:06:21,746 --> 01:06:23,611
Come with me.

2408
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:24,240
小心

2409
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,640
黄灯不能停下来

2410
01:06:24,449 --> 01:06:25,549
Watch out.

2411
01:06:25,584 --> 01:06:27,615
Yellow ones don't stop.

2412
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:28,300
黄灯不能停下来

2413
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,647
The yellow ones don't stop.

2414
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:37,910
太大了

2415
01:06:35,127 --> 01:06:39,257
Wow... that's a big one.

2416
01:06:58,670 --> 01:07:00,210
对不起

2417
01:07:00,017 --> 01:07:01,368
I'm sorry.

2418
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:01,380
你错过了

2419
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:03,310
错过什么了？

2420
01:07:01,403 --> 01:07:02,685
You missed.

2421
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,655
What do you mean I missed?

2422
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:04,830
错过吻我的机会

2423
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:06,178
You missed.

2424
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:25,930

2434
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:38,410
是的

2435
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:40,810
我是沃特.霍布斯，我们

2436
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:39,720
Yeah.

2437

I'm Walter Hobbs. Yeah, let's get
the, uh...

2438
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:43,680
该如何说起呢

2439
01:07:42,426 --> 01:07:45,027
Taken care of so we can get started
here.

2440
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,410
来吧

2441
01:07:45,062 --> 01:07:46,756
Here you go.

2442
01:07:46,990 --> 01:07:48,390
好的

2443
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:49,696
Great.

2444
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:50,860
好了

2445
01:07:49,731 --> 01:07:52,217
All right... clears throat

2446
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:53,360
你们讨论到什么地方了？

2447
01:07:52,252 --> 01:07:54,702
What have you guys got so far?

2448
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,960
继续吧

2449
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,037
Go ahead.

2450
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,000
嗯

2451
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,230
我们刚才讨论的是

2452
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:57,303
Uh...

2453
01:07:57,338 --> 01:08:00,575
We were thinking, uh, something
like this, uh...

2454
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:01,240
主角是西红柿

2455
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:02,542
We open on a young tomato.

2456
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,370
它在农场里面受了很多苦

2457
01:08:02,577 --> 01:08:04,712
He's had some tough times down
at the farm

2458
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:05,240
然后，出现了兔子

2459
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,581
With, you know, a rabbit, and...

2460
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,770
西红柿

2461
01:08:06,616 --> 01:08:08,166
No. No tomatoes...

2462
01:08:07,770 --> 01:08:08,380
过于脆弱了

2463
01:08:08,201 --> 01:08:09,682
Too vulnerable.

2464
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:10,240
现在的孩子们已经太娇惯了

2465
01:08:09,717 --> 01:08:11,268
Kids, they're already vulnerable.

2466
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,480
还不懂？我不是说了吗

2467
01:08:11,303 --> 01:08:12,996
No, you see? I... I told you guys.

2468
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:13,350
都好几遍了

2469
01:08:13,031 --> 01:08:14,689
I told them the very same thing...

2470
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:14,100
不需要农场

2471
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:16,480
大家都喜欢用农村作为背景

2472
01:08:14,724 --> 01:08:15,321
And no farms.

2473
01:08:15,356 --> 01:08:17,792
Every body's pushing small town
rural.

2474
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,890
都变成陈词滥调了

2475
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:20,227
A farm book would just be white
noise.

2476
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:19,750
这又如何？

2477
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:22,760
芦笋娃娃部落

2478
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:21,059
What about this?

2479
01:08:21,094 --> 01:08:24,062
Uh, a tribe of asparagus children,

2480
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:27,390
但它们有自知之明

2481
01:08:24,097 --> 01:08:28,727
But they're self-conscious about
the way their pee smells.

2482
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,430
我们都喜欢用蔬菜作为主角

2483
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,775
Apparently, all we have is
vegetables.

2484
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:35,940
我的时间不多了

2485
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:37,060
I have no time, so, you know,

2486
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:36,970
你有什么好的故事

2487
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:39,770
我预备了五六个开头

2488
01:08:37,095 --> 01:08:38,276
If you've got a story here...

2489
01:08:38,311 --> 01:08:41,114
I've got about five or six great
starts here.

2490
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:41,840
但其中一个

2491
01:08:41,149 --> 01:08:43,182
I've got one idea that
I'm especially

2492
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,400
是我觉得最满意的

2493
01:08:43,217 --> 01:08:45,401
Psyched out of my mind about.

2494
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,250
就是这样的主意

2495
01:08:45,436 --> 01:08:47,295
You know, it's one of those ideas

2496
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:47,810
你肯定会喜欢的

2497
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:49,154
Where you're just like, uh...

2498
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:48,750
是的

2499
01:08:49,189 --> 01:08:50,054
Yes!

2500
01:08:50,089 --> 01:08:52,289
Whoa!

2501
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:53,390
能说来听听吗？

2502
01:08:52,324 --> 01:08:54,692
Uh, great, c-could we hear it?

2503
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:56,760
我从头说起，这样子的…

2504
01:08:54,727 --> 01:08:58,097
I'll start with the cover.
Picture this... you got, uh

2505
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:58,760
爸爸，我恋爱了

2506
01:08:58,132 --> 01:09:00,867
Dad! I'm in love, I'm in love,

2507
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:02,260
恋爱大过天

2508
01:09:00,902 --> 01:09:03,602
And I don't care who knows it!

2509
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:03,000
巴迪，现在不要捣乱

2510
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,400
你回到房间去

2511
01:09:03,637 --> 01:09:04,301
Buddy, not now, uh,

2512
01:09:04,336 --> 01:09:06,620
Can you please go back to the...
to the pit?

2513
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,570
我等下去看你

2514
01:09:06,655 --> 01:09:08,906
I'll come and visit you in a
little while, okay?

2515
01:09:07,570 --> 01:09:11,700
怎么又来了一个精灵了呢？

2516
01:09:08,941 --> 01:09:12,375
I didn't know you had elves
working here.

2517
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:15,980
朋友，你的话真是让人讨厌

2518
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:17,315
Oh... boy, you're... you're hilarious,
my friend.

2519
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:18,280
-他不是…   -回去吧

2520
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:19,582
He doesn't, uh... get back to

2521
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,940
-请继续讲故事   -好了

2522
01:09:19,617 --> 01:09:22,287
The story, please. All right, okay.

2523
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:23,580
故事的开始…

2524
01:09:23,421 --> 01:09:24,887
So, on the cover above the title...

2525
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:26,120
圣诞老人 让你离开工作室了吗？

2526
01:09:24,922 --> 01:09:27,274
Does Santa know that you left the
workshop?

2527
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,290
你的话真是让人捧腹大笑

2528
01:09:27,309 --> 01:09:29,592
You know, we're all laughing our
heads off.

2529
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:30,420
你借了驯鹿才能下凡了吧？

2530
01:09:29,627 --> 01:09:31,762
Did you have to borrow a reindeer
to get down here?

2531
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:32,290
巴迪，回到地下室去

2532
01:09:31,797 --> 01:09:33,630
Buddy... go back to the basement.

2533
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:33,860
嗨，杰克

2534
01:09:33,665 --> 01:09:35,163
Hey, jack weed,

2535
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:35,460
我一周的内做的事情

2536
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:36,765
I get more action in a week

2537
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:36,860
比你一生做的事情都有意义

2538
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,166
Than you've had your entire life.

2539
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:40,470
我在洛衫矶 巴黎还有威尔都有购房

2540
01:09:38,201 --> 01:09:41,805
I've got houses in I.e., Paris,
and Vail,

2541
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:41,900
每所房子

2542
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,205
Oh. Each one of them

2543
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:43,900
都配备了70寸的液晶电视

2544
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,242
with a 70-inchplasma screen.

2545
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:45,410
所以麻烦你

2546
01:09:45,277 --> 01:09:46,708
So, I suggest you wipe

2547
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:46,810
收起你那些让人恶心的微笑

2548
01:09:46,743 --> 01:09:48,110
That stupid smile off your face

2549
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:49,380
否则要你好看

2550
01:09:48,145 --> 01:09:50,714
Before I come over there and smack
it off!

2551
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:51,400
你感情强烈

2552
01:09:50,749 --> 01:09:52,382
You feeling strong, my friend?!

2553
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,480
再叫我精灵的话

2554
01:09:52,417 --> 01:09:55,817
Call me elf one more time!

2555
01:09:58,450 --> 01:10:01,320
他是位愤怒的精灵

2556
01:09:59,789 --> 01:10:02,656
He's an angry elf.

2557
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,930
看看你

2558
01:10:05,361 --> 01:10:08,262
Look at you.

2559
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:10,830
嗨

2560
01:10:10,199 --> 01:10:12,168
Ow! Hey, what...

2561
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:11,630
啊

2562
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:13,330
我还没准备好呢

2563
01:10:12,968 --> 01:10:14,670
I wasn't ready for that.

2564
01:10:13,330 --> 01:10:14,400
嗨

2565
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,870
嗨

2566
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:18,370
啊

2567
01:10:18,370 --> 01:10:20,340
再叫我一次精灵

2568
01:10:19,708 --> 01:10:21,676
Call me elf one more time!

2569
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:21,840
叫啊

2570
01:10:21,711 --> 01:10:23,457
Call me elf!

2571
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,870
你就是精灵

2572
01:10:23,492 --> 01:10:25,203
You're an elf.

2573
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:32,910
迈尔斯，很抱歉 他一直以为自己是精灵

2574
01:10:30,518 --> 01:10:34,249
Miles, I'm sorry, he... he thinks
he's an elf.

2575
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:34,690
听我说

2576
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:35,960
迈尔斯

2577
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:35,989
Listen, miles...

2578
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:39,690
他肯定是住在南极的精灵

2579
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:38,523
Listen, miles! Door slams

2580
01:10:38,558 --> 01:10:41,023
He must be a South Pole elf.

2581
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:43,130
给我滚出去

2582
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:45,400
要我到哪里？

2583
01:10:43,365 --> 01:10:45,049
You get the hell outta here.

2584
01:10:45,084 --> 01:10:46,392
Where do you want me to go?

2585
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,370
我不管你到哪里

2586
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:47,900
也不管你是否精灵

2587
01:10:46,427 --> 01:10:47,666
I don't care where you go.

2588
01:10:47,701 --> 01:10:48,969
I don't care that you're an elf!

2589
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:48,900
不管你是否笨蛋

2590
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:51,140
也不承认你是我儿子

2591
01:10:49,004 --> 01:10:50,738
I don't care that you're nuts!

2592
01:10:50,773 --> 01:10:52,473
I don't care that you're my son!

2593
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:54,700
你给我永远消失

2594
01:10:52,508 --> 01:10:55,408
Get out of my life now!

2595
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:05,550
嗨，是我啊

2596
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:07,120
暂时没有时间聊

2597
01:11:05,853 --> 01:11:06,852
Hi, it's me.

2598
01:11:06,887 --> 01:11:08,419
I really can't talk right now.

2599
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,420
故事发展得怎么样了？

2600
01:11:08,454 --> 01:11:10,722
Well, just tell me how the pitch
went.

2601
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:12,190
今晚要迟点回来

2602
01:11:10,757 --> 01:11:13,526
I'm gonna be a little later than
I thought, okay?

2603
01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:14,460
不要太晚了

2604
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:15,795
Well, don't be too late, Walter,

2605
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:16,000
今天是圣诞前夕

2606
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:17,547
It's Christmas Eve.

2607
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,930
沃特，等等

2608
01:11:17,582 --> 01:11:19,230
Walter... wait, um.

2609
01:11:17,930 --> 01:11:20,700
我要走了

2610
01:11:19,265 --> 01:11:21,401
Honey, I gotta go, okay? Love ya.

2611
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,230
帮我问候巴迪

2612
01:11:21,436 --> 01:11:23,562
Oh, say hi to buddy.

2613
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:24,740
-怎么了？ -沃特，峰回路转啊

2614
01:11:24,437 --> 01:11:26,037
What? Walter, breakthrough.

2615
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:26,970
我们在会议室找到这东西

2616
01:11:26,072 --> 01:11:28,307
We found this in the conference
room.

2617
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:27,470
什么啊？

2618
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:29,410
是迈尔斯.芬奇的笔记本

2619
01:11:28,342 --> 01:11:28,773
What is it?

2620
01:11:28,808 --> 01:11:30,708
It's miles finch's notebook.

2621
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:32,580
上面记载着无数的创意

2622
01:11:30,743 --> 01:11:33,912
This thing is chock full of
genius ideas.

2623
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:33,250
看看吧

2624
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:37,120
他设想的是用水蜜桃做主角

2625
01:11:33,947 --> 01:11:34,544
I mean, look at that.

2626
01:11:34,579 --> 01:11:38,450
And his best idea is about a
peach that lives on a farm.

2627
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,420
有什么比水蜜桃 更让人怜爱的呢

2628
01:11:38,485 --> 01:11:40,752
What's more vulnerable than a
peach?

2629
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:40,900
我们该怎么办？

2630
01:11:40,787 --> 01:11:41,385
What, uh, what do we do?

2631
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:43,420
我们该马上动手构思故事了

2632
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:44,756
I think we should go with the
first pitch... it's genius.

2633
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:44,900
还剩多少时间？

2634
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:45,389
Uh, how much time we got?

2635
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:45,960
45分钟，我们马上动手吧

2636
01:11:45,424 --> 01:11:47,292
We got, like, 45 minutes. Well,
come on, let's, uh,

2637
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,960
准备故事板

2638
01:11:47,327 --> 01:11:49,294
Try to get a storyboard or
something ready.

2639
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,230
快点

2640
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:51,730
还愣在哪里干嘛？

2641
01:11:49,329 --> 01:11:50,527
Come on, let's do it. Just try.

2642
01:11:50,562 --> 01:11:53,064
No, you can't sit down and get a
storyboard ready.

2643
01:11:51,730 --> 01:11:53,270
马上去准备故事板吧

2644
01:11:53,099 --> 01:11:54,599
Go and get a storyboard ready.

2645
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:55,530
去啊

2646
01:11:54,634 --> 01:11:56,862
Oh, boy! Go.

2647
01:11:58,170 --> 01:12:01,740
很对不起 扰乱了你们的生活

2648
01:11:59,503 --> 01:12:03,038
"I'm sorry I ruined your lives

2649
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:06,680
还把11块饼干塞到 摄像机里面去了

2650
01:12:03,073 --> 01:12:07,977
"And crammed 11 cookies into
the vcr.

2651
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:12,800
我不属于这世界

2652
01:12:08,012 --> 01:12:13,416
"I don't belong here. I don't
belong anywhere.

2653
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:18,600
我忘不了你们 亲爱的巴迪敬上

2654
01:12:13,851 --> 01:12:19,390
I'll never forget you. Love,
buddy."

2655
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,490
老天

2656
01:12:19,425 --> 01:12:20,823
God...

2657
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,160
嗨，巴迪

2658
01:12:31,968 --> 01:12:33,492
Hey, buddy.

2659
01:12:34,770 --> 01:12:36,240
巴迪？

2660
01:12:36,105 --> 01:12:37,572
Buddy?

2661
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:44,220
我们得抓紧啊

2662
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:45,547
As you know, we need a big
launch fast

2663
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:45,590
这样才能使公司回春

2664
01:12:45,582 --> 01:12:46,880
To get the company back on
track.

2665
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:48,820
我代表工作组发言

2666
01:12:46,915 --> 01:12:50,152
So, I think I speak for my fellow
board members

2667
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:53,290
-我要说的是 -最好不要令我失望

2668
01:12:50,187 --> 01:12:53,322
When I say... this better be good.

2669
01:12:53,290 --> 01:12:55,130
我开始叙述之前

2670
01:12:53,357 --> 01:12:55,908
Before I get into the story, uh,

2671
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:57,130
我从封面设计开始

2672
01:12:55,943 --> 01:12:58,460
Let me start with the cover, okay?

2673
01:12:57,130 --> 01:12:58,800
请看…

2674
01:12:58,495 --> 01:13:00,763
Now, just picture this...

2675
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,700
爸爸！我有话给你说

2676
01:13:00,798 --> 01:13:02,715
Dad! I gotta talk to you.

2677
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:03,300
迈克尔，怎么了？

2678
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:04,633
Michael, what is it?

2679
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,570
巴迪离家出走了

2680
01:13:04,570 --> 01:13:06,670
-什么？   -他留下信息

2681
01:13:04,668 --> 01:13:05,866
Buddy ran away.

2682
01:13:05,901 --> 01:13:08,286
What? He... he left a note.

2683
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:09,340
我很担心 他能到哪里去呢

2684
01:13:08,321 --> 01:13:10,636
I'm scared, dad, he's gone.

2685
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:11,750
先让我开会吧

2686
01:13:10,671 --> 01:13:13,140
Uh, let me just finish this
meeting,

2687
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:14,280
然后再一起想办法

2688
01:13:13,175 --> 01:13:15,575
And then, um, we'll figure it
out, okay?

2689
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:18,690
想什么办法？ 巴迪爱着身边每个人

2690
01:13:15,610 --> 01:13:20,014
Figure out what? Buddy cares
about everybody.

2691
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:20,850
而你爱的只是钱

2692
01:13:20,049 --> 01:13:22,175
All you care about is yourself.

2693
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:25,800
迈克尔

2694
01:13:23,918 --> 01:13:26,409
Hey, Michael.

2695
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,230
等等

2696
01:13:27,088 --> 01:13:28,555
Wait.

2697
01:13:30,530 --> 01:13:34,300
格林威先生 能把会议改期吗？

2698
01:13:31,859 --> 01:13:35,362
We're gonna have to reschedule
this, uh, Mr. Greenway.

2699
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,540
时间不允许

2700
01:13:35,397 --> 01:13:36,780
We don't have time to reschedule.

2701
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:36,840
我现在就要听听你们的故事

2702
01:13:36,815 --> 01:13:38,164
I wanna hear the damn thing now.

2703
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,400
那只能请你稍等了

2704
01:13:38,199 --> 01:13:39,331
Son, you'll have to wait.

2705
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:42,700
我得和儿子说几句

2706
01:13:39,366 --> 01:13:43,393
No, d-don't tell my kid what
to do, uh...

2707
01:13:42,610 --> 01:13:45,580
如果会议不能改期 恕我无能为力

2708
01:13:43,937 --> 01:13:46,907
Can't... can't we do this another
time, Mr. Greenway?

2709
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:49,720
我千辛万苦赶回来 就是为了开会

2710
01:13:46,942 --> 01:13:49,709
I flew in just to hear this pitch,

2711
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:51,220
会议不得不延期

2712
01:13:49,744 --> 01:13:51,009
And I intend to.

2713
01:13:51,044 --> 01:13:52,511
It's gonna have to wait.

2714
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:53,250
要保住饭碗

2715
01:13:52,546 --> 01:13:54,546
If you wanna keep your job, Hobbs,

2716
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:56,220
就马上给我开会

2717
01:13:54,581 --> 01:13:57,550
You will pitch me this book
right now.

2718
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:06,230
嗯…去你的

2719
01:14:04,557 --> 01:14:07,605
Well... up yours.

2720
01:14:06,230 --> 01:14:09,330
去你的

2721
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:10,654
Yeah, up yours.

2722
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:12,270
霍布斯！

2723
01:14:12,064 --> 01:14:13,564
Hobbs... Hobbs!

2724
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:14,700
你走出这里

2725
01:14:13,599 --> 01:14:15,366
Hobbs, you walk out of here,

2726
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,610
就别想回来了

2727
01:14:15,401 --> 01:14:17,937
And... and you're finished at
greenway!

2728
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:18,170
你完蛋了

2729
01:14:17,972 --> 01:14:19,495
You're finished!

2730
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,390
我不属于这世界

2731
01:14:36,721 --> 01:14:39,713
I don't belong anywhere.

2732
01:14:40,670 --> 01:14:42,770
巴迪！

2733
01:14:41,993 --> 01:14:43,978
Buddy!

2734
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,640
巴迪！

2735
01:14:44,013 --> 01:14:45,929
Buddy!

2736
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,800
你在哪里？

2737
01:14:45,964 --> 01:14:48,124
Buddy, where are you?!

2738
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:58,690
马儿，用力拉啊，用力

2739
01:14:55,606 --> 01:15:00,010
Prancer, pull! Come on! Come on!

2740
01:14:58,690 --> 01:15:02,260
拉上去

2741
01:15:00,045 --> 01:15:03,580
Vixen, up, up!

2742
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:04,380
圣诞老人？

2743
01:15:03,615 --> 01:15:05,707
Santa?

2744
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:07,790
你能行的

2745
01:15:06,116 --> 01:15:09,119
Come on, you can do it.

2746
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:11,420
拉上去

2747
01:15:09,154 --> 01:15:12,747
Pull up! Pull up!

2748
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:21,370
-爸爸！   -怎么了？

2749
01:15:20,596 --> 01:15:22,663
Dad! What?

2750
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:22,880
迈克尔，你要到哪里？

2751
01:15:22,698 --> 01:15:24,200
Michael, where you going?

2752
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,240
迈克尔！

2753
01:15:24,235 --> 01:15:25,565
Michael!

2754
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:42,760
圣诞老人

2755
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:47,470
退后，你会吓着鹿儿的

2756
01:15:43,685 --> 01:15:44,050
Santa.

2757
01:15:44,085 --> 01:15:48,790
Back off, slick. You'll scare
the deer.

2758
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:50,240
巴迪，是你吗？

2759
01:15:48,825 --> 01:15:51,559
Buddy, is that you?

2760
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,200
你没事吧？

2761
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,810
见到你真高兴

2762
01:15:51,594 --> 01:15:52,492
Are you okay?

2763
01:15:52,527 --> 01:15:55,095
Boy, am I glad to see you.

2764
01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:57,710
度量器显示为零

2765
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:59,034
The Claus meter suddenly just
dropped down to zero.

2766
01:15:57,710 --> 01:16:01,350
圣诞精神能量为零

2767
01:15:59,069 --> 01:16:02,670
There's just no Christmas
spirit anymore.

2768
01:16:01,350 --> 01:16:03,850
而且过度使用机器

2769
01:16:02,705 --> 01:16:05,684
And then the strain was too
Much...

2770
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:07,340
引擎出了大问题了

2771
01:16:05,719 --> 01:16:08,664
The engine broke free of her
mounts.

2772
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:14,890
需要精灵的帮助

2773
01:16:13,647 --> 01:16:16,181
I need an elf's help.

2774
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:17,500
我不是精灵，圣诞老人

2775
01:16:16,216 --> 01:16:18,718
I... I'm not an elf, Santa.

2776
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,900
没有能力修理

2777
01:16:18,753 --> 01:16:21,186
I... I can't do anything right.

2778
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:24,740
巴迪 你是我知道的最棒的精灵

2779
01:16:21,221 --> 01:16:26,059
Buddy, you're more of an elf than
anyone I ever met,

2780
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:26,840
而且你是今晚唯一一位

2781
01:16:26,094 --> 01:16:28,462
And the only one who I would want

2782
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:29,510
能帮我修理雪橇的精灵

2783
01:16:28,497 --> 01:16:30,830
Working on my sleigh tonight.

2784
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:31,480
-真的吗？   -当然

2785
01:16:30,865 --> 01:16:32,764
Really? Really.

2786
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,880
能帮我修理吗？

2787
01:16:32,799 --> 01:16:35,418
Will you fix it for me, buddy?

2788
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,720
我试试，爸爸教过我的

2789
01:16:35,453 --> 01:16:38,037
I'll try. Papa taught me how.

2790
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:37,550
你先把引擎找回来

2791
01:16:37,550 --> 01:16:40,350
路上就发生故障，丢掉了

2792
01:16:38,072 --> 01:16:38,836
You gotta find it first.

2793
01:16:38,871 --> 01:16:41,674
It dropped off the sleigh back
over there a ways.

2794
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:43,290
-引擎？   -对啊

2795
01:16:41,709 --> 01:16:44,610
The engine? The engine, yeah.

2796
01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:46,380
去吧，我的精灵小朋友巴迪

2797
01:16:44,645 --> 01:16:47,714
Go, buddy. Go, Mr. Elf!

2798
01:16:47,790 --> 01:16:49,460
我身后是中央公园

2799
01:16:49,114 --> 01:16:50,747
I'm standing here outside
central park

2800
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:53,000
里面发生了意外 但暂时没有详细资料

2801
01:16:50,782 --> 01:16:54,319
Where it is unclear exactly
what has happened.

2802
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,770
当局已经封闭此处

2803
01:16:54,354 --> 01:16:56,221
What we do know is that
authorities

2804
01:16:55,770 --> 01:16:57,400
正在清理当中

2805
01:16:56,256 --> 01:16:57,054
Have closed the park

2806
01:16:57,089 --> 01:16:58,321
And are in the process of
clearing it.

2807
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,770
而根据现场目击者称

2808
01:16:58,356 --> 01:17:01,093
The only thing that people can
seem to agree on here

2809
01:16:59,770 --> 01:17:03,280
天上落下了不明物体

2810
01:17:01,128 --> 01:17:04,596
Is that they saw something fall
from the sky.

2811
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:04,540
我身边是其中一位目击者

2812
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:06,750
她首先发现了情况

2813
01:17:04,631 --> 01:17:05,829
I've got an eyewitness with me

2814
01:17:05,864 --> 01:17:08,066
Who claims to have seen the whole
thing firsthand.

2815
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:07,980
你到底看到什么了呢？

2816
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:10,520
我刚好路过此处

2817
01:17:08,101 --> 01:17:09,266
What did you actually see?

2818
01:17:09,301 --> 01:17:11,837
You know, I was walking around and
I saw this thing,

2819
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,790
女儿指着天空对我说

2820
01:17:11,872 --> 01:17:14,105
And my daughter actually pointed
it out to me.

2821
01:17:12,790 --> 01:17:13,850
你女儿看到了该物体？

2822
01:17:13,850 --> 01:17:14,890
宝贝，你能告诉我

2823
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:15,173
Oh, your daughter saw it?

2824
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:17,260
你到底看到天上出现什么了？

2825
01:17:15,208 --> 01:17:16,172
Sweetheart, can you tell me

2826
01:17:16,207 --> 01:17:18,576
What you saw falling out of the
sky?

2827
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:18,950
我看到圣诞老人的雪橇

2828
01:17:18,611 --> 01:17:20,277
It was Santa's sleigh!

2829
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:22,460
圣诞老人的雪橇 真是有创意

2830
01:17:21,912 --> 01:17:23,781
Santa's sleigh, well, there you
have it.

2831
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:23,330
圣诞老人光临曼哈顿了

2832
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:26,500
很抱歉中断你的报导

2833
01:17:23,816 --> 01:17:24,613
Santa's in Manhattan.

2834
01:17:24,648 --> 01:17:27,818
Sorry to interrupt your first big
news story, charlotte,

2835
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,770
但据纽约第一频道报导

2836
01:17:27,853 --> 01:17:29,988
But New York one has just received

2837
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:30,800
不少市民提供信息

2838
01:17:30,023 --> 01:17:32,124
Some exclusive amateur news footage

2839
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,910
你或许会对此产生兴趣

2840
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:34,190
That you just might Anna follow
up on.

2841
01:17:32,910 --> 01:17:36,310
出现了一位 身穿圣诞老人服装的怪人

2842
01:17:34,225 --> 01:17:37,627
There seems to be a strange man
dressed as an elf

2843
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:37,810
在中央公园游荡

2844
01:17:37,662 --> 01:17:39,094
Wandering through central park.

2845
01:17:37,810 --> 01:17:40,810
这算不算是水牛镇有史以来

2846
01:17:39,129 --> 01:17:42,132
Now, I don't know if this is the
kind of hard-hitting news

2847
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:42,850
充满爆炸性的新闻呢？

2848
01:17:42,167 --> 01:17:44,167
You're used to covering in buffalo,
charlotte,

2849
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:44,450
-天啊 -你收看的是纽约第一频道

2850
01:17:44,202 --> 01:17:45,769
Oh, my god. But here at New York one,

2851
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:46,940
紧急新闻报导

2852
01:17:45,804 --> 01:17:48,260
News is top priority.

2853
01:17:57,460 --> 01:17:59,970
怎么了？

2854
01:17:58,782 --> 01:18:01,283
What the heck...?

2855
01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:01,870
嗨

2856
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:05,000
-你们来了！   -巴迪

2857
01:18:03,619 --> 01:18:06,315
You found it. Buddy!

2858
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:12,500
我有话要对你说

2859
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,211
I need to tell you something.

2860
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:13,350
巴迪

2861
01:18:13,246 --> 01:18:14,321
No, no. Buddy, there's something

2862
01:18:13,350 --> 01:18:14,800
我有话要对你说

2863
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:15,362
I have to tell you right now.

2864
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:17,950
我刚才说的话并不是心里话

2865
01:18:15,397 --> 01:18:19,268
Um, I didn't mean anything I said back
there, not word.

2866
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:21,990
虽然你有时候

2867
01:18:19,303 --> 01:18:23,305
I know you may be a little, um, um...

2868
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:23,420
会惹点小麻烦

2869
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:24,705
Uh, chemically imbalanced,

2870
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:26,160
但很多时候，你都说对了

2871
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:27,475
But you've been right about a lot
of things.

2872
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,330
我不想你离开

2873
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:30,909
I... I don't want you to leave.

2874
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:32,990
你是我儿子，我爱你

2875
01:18:30,944 --> 01:18:34,308
You're my son, and I... love you.

2876
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:41,140
巴迪

2877
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:44,100
你不是有话要对我说吗？

2878
01:18:41,656 --> 01:18:42,421
Uh, buddy, uh...

2879
01:18:42,456 --> 01:18:45,326
What was it you wanted to tell me?

2880
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:46,380
是啊，跟我来

2881
01:18:45,361 --> 01:18:47,695
Oh, right. Come with me.

2882
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:48,180
来吧

2883
01:18:47,730 --> 01:18:49,492
Right. Come on.

2884
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:55,890
这是另一位目击者

2885
01:18:55,735 --> 01:18:57,169
I'm herewith another eyewitness

2886
01:18:55,890 --> 01:18:58,190
他也有自己的说法

2887
01:18:57,204 --> 01:18:59,506
Who has his own version of what
happened.

2888
01:18:58,190 --> 01:18:59,360
先生，你当时看到什么了呢？

2889
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:00,590
夏洛特，我觉得你很好

2890
01:18:59,541 --> 01:19:00,639
Sir, what did you see?

2891
01:19:00,590 --> 01:19:02,930
我看到天上掉下东西

2892
01:19:00,674 --> 01:19:01,873
I think you're great, charlotte.

2893
01:19:01,908 --> 01:19:03,693
Uh, I saw something fall from the
sky

2894
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:04,160
落在中央公园

2895
01:19:03,728 --> 01:19:05,478
Right into the middle of central
park.

2896
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:06,530
你是出色的女新闻主持人

2897
01:19:05,513 --> 01:19:07,848
I mean, you're a great news lady.

2898
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:07,370
谢谢你

2899
01:19:07,370 --> 01:19:08,400
还能有更多的情况吗？

2900
01:19:07,883 --> 01:19:08,647
Thank you.

2901
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,670
关于你所说的天上物体

2902
01:19:08,682 --> 01:19:09,681
Could you tell me a bit more?

2903
01:19:09,670 --> 01:19:11,400
你的眼睛会说话

2904
01:19:09,716 --> 01:19:11,034
About what you saw fall from the
sky?

2905
01:19:11,069 --> 01:19:12,317
Yeah, yeah. Your eyes tell the
story,

2906
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,940
我喜欢极了 你的嘴巴很性感

2907
01:19:12,352 --> 01:19:14,353
That's what I love about you.
You've got a great mouth.

2908
01:19:12,940 --> 01:19:15,400
掉在中央公园的物体

2909
01:19:14,388 --> 01:19:16,806
The thing just dropped in the middle of
central park.

2910
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,910
实在太神奇了 大家都很吃惊

2911
01:19:16,841 --> 01:19:19,225
It was amazing, and everybody's, like,
going crazy.

2912
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:19,880
根据官方消息

2913
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:21,193
Dick, uh, according to authorities,

2914
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,110
该地区已经被检查了

2915
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:24,680
园内只有巡逻队

2916
01:19:21,228 --> 01:19:22,393
The area has been cleared.

2917
01:19:22,428 --> 01:19:25,998
Only the central park rangers now
remain in the park.

2918
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,520
该部队受过专业训练

2919
01:19:26,033 --> 01:19:27,833
These forces are highly trained,

2920
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,920
但很少接受任务

2921
01:19:27,868 --> 01:19:29,200
But rarely see action.

2922
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:31,600
当遇到真正考验时

2923
01:19:29,235 --> 01:19:32,371
Some have accused them of being
too gung ho

2924
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:31,990
他们都十分齐心

2925
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:34,430
而他们在85年的时候

2926
01:19:32,406 --> 01:19:33,270
When called into duty,

2927
01:19:33,305 --> 01:19:36,041
And their controversial crowd
control tactics

2928
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:37,460
西蒙和加丰科中央公园 演唱会的人流控制策略

2929
01:19:36,076 --> 01:19:38,776
At the Simon and Garfunkel concert
in '85

2930
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:39,700
至今仍是迷

2931
01:19:38,811 --> 01:19:41,112
Are still under investigation.

2932
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:42,100
就知道你会找到的

2933
01:19:41,147 --> 01:19:43,379
I knew you'd find it, Mr. Elf!

2934
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:45,430
快点安装，然后出发吧

2935
01:19:43,414 --> 01:19:46,747
Slap it on real quick, we've got
to get going.

2936
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:49,700
干得好，孩子

2937
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:50,388
That ta boy.

2938
01:19:52,110 --> 01:19:54,910
你…

2939
01:19:53,424 --> 01:19:56,156
So, uh... you're, uh...

2940
01:19:54,910 --> 01:19:57,580
-圣诞老人 -怎么了

2941
01:19:56,191 --> 01:19:58,889
Santa Claus. Right.

2942
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:02,690
能把这东西拿给你长子吗？

2943
01:20:00,031 --> 01:20:04,001
Would you mind taking this to
your firstborn?

2944
01:20:02,690 --> 01:20:03,220
当然

2945
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:06,430
我的长子是精灵？

2946
01:20:04,036 --> 01:20:04,499
Sure.

2947
01:20:04,534 --> 01:20:07,738
Um, uh, and my firstborn, he's
an elf?

2948
01:20:06,430 --> 01:20:10,900
是的，我是收养的

2949
01:20:07,773 --> 01:20:11,401
Yes. Actually, I'm adopted.

2950
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:14,460
迈克尔 你能帮我打开帐篷吗？

2951
01:20:11,742 --> 01:20:15,769
Uh, Michael, would you open this
hatch for me, please?

2952
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:22,240
干得好，孩子

2953
01:20:21,451 --> 01:20:23,518
That ta boy, thank you.

2954
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:25,950
你真的是圣诞老人？

2955
01:20:23,553 --> 01:20:27,256
So, you're really Santa Claus?

2956
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:28,680
如假包换

2957
01:20:27,291 --> 01:20:29,992
You never can tell, kid.

2958
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:29,550
迈克尔

2959
01:20:29,550 --> 01:20:31,250
你想要什么圣诞礼物呢？

2960
01:20:30,027 --> 01:20:30,825
Tell me, Michael,

2961
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:32,561
What do you want for Christmas?

2962
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:32,320
滑板

2963
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:37,520
不单止滑板吧

2964
01:20:32,596 --> 01:20:35,715
I wanted a skateboard.

2965
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:39,277
Oh, not just skateboard.

2966
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:41,490
看这里

2967
01:20:39,312 --> 01:20:42,805
Arealhuf board. Looked here.

2968
01:20:41,490 --> 01:20:42,960
瞧

2969
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,238
Looked here...

2970
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,300
喜欢吗？

2971
01:20:44,273 --> 01:20:46,342
How do you like them apples?

2972
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:47,760
看看吧

2973
01:20:46,377 --> 01:20:49,072
Go look and see.

2974
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:55,540
哇

2975
01:20:55,383 --> 01:20:56,850
Whoa.

2976
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:03,280
怎么了？

2977
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:06,200
你让我的雪橇动起来了

2978
01:21:03,558 --> 01:21:04,557
What happened?

2979
01:21:04,592 --> 01:21:07,329
You made my sleigh fly.

2980
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:06,790
什么意思？

2981
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:08,990
机器时代之前

2982
01:21:07,364 --> 01:21:08,061
What do you mean?

2983
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:10,263
Well, before the turbine days,

2984
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:11,990
雪橇只能依靠圣诞情绪发动

2985
01:21:10,298 --> 01:21:13,301
This baby used to run solely on
Christmas spirit.

2986
01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:16,800
你相信我 所以雪橇就有能量了

2987
01:21:13,336 --> 01:21:16,721
You believed in me. You made my
sleigh fly.

2988
01:21:16,756 --> 01:21:20,072
Hold it... if you're really Santa
Claus,

2989
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,800
如果你真的是圣诞老人

2990
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,230
那么叫他们进来拍摄

2991
01:21:20,107 --> 01:21:22,543
Then we can just get some news
cameras in here,

2992
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:22,570
然后全世界的人都相信你了

2993
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:23,640
雪橇就能飞翔了

2994
01:21:22,578 --> 01:21:23,761
And everyone will believe in you,

2995
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:27,170
圣诞情绪源于信仰

2996
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:24,910
Then your sleigh will fly, right?

2997
01:21:24,945 --> 01:21:27,948
Christmas spirit is about believing,
not seeing.

2998
01:21:27,170 --> 01:21:29,640
若是人们都看见了 信仰便不存在了

2999
01:21:27,983 --> 01:21:30,916
If the whole world saw me,
all would be lost.

3000
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:33,810
很多人都想拍摄到我的真面目

3001
01:21:30,951 --> 01:21:35,122
The paparazzi have been trying to
nail me for years.

3002
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:38,800
看

3003
01:21:37,925 --> 01:21:39,392
Hey, look!

3004
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,580
不

3005
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:50,790
是中央公园巡逻队

3006
01:21:48,334 --> 01:21:52,105
It's the central park rangers.

3007
01:21:55,300 --> 01:22:00,340
爸爸，迈克尔，我有办法了

3008
01:21:56,342 --> 01:22:01,644
Dad, Michael... I got a plan.

3009
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,820
等等，迈克尔，我的名册

3010
01:22:09,388 --> 01:22:12,089
Whoa, wait! Wait, Michael...
my list!

3011
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:13,590
马上给我拿回来，听到吗？

3012
01:22:12,124 --> 01:22:14,893
You bring that list back right now,
you hear me?!

3013
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:15,660
把帽子和大衣给我

3014
01:22:14,928 --> 01:22:16,962
Come on, give me your hat and coat.

3015
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:18,590
圣诞婆婆给我制造的啊

3016
01:22:16,997 --> 01:22:19,897
Mrs. Claus made them for me.

3017
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:25,850
嗨，我来了

3018
01:22:24,169 --> 01:22:27,161
Hey! Hey, here I am!

3019
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:33,370
嗨

3020
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:42,820
-抱歉   -谢谢

3021
01:22:42,053 --> 01:22:44,086
Excuse me. Thank you. Excuse me.

3022
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:44,750
当局已经发现了

3023
01:22:44,121 --> 01:22:46,057
So the authorities have not
discovered

3024
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:46,620
公园里面有驯鹿了吗？

3025
01:22:46,092 --> 01:22:47,890
Any reindeer in the park?

3026
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:48,420
-没有   -雪橇的痕迹呢？

3027
01:22:47,925 --> 01:22:49,443
No, no reindeer. Sleigh bells?

3028
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:49,660
也没有

3029
01:22:49,478 --> 01:22:50,703
No, no sleigh bells, either.

3030
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:50,620
-精灵呢？   -对不起

3031
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:51,790
都没有，我需要有人来…

3032
01:22:50,738 --> 01:22:51,894
Elves? Excuse me, please.

3033
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:52,890
是他！真正的圣诞老人

3034
01:22:51,929 --> 01:22:53,096
None of that, we really just
need everyone...

3035
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:54,660
他的雪橇不能飞翔 因为大家都不相信他

3036
01:22:53,131 --> 01:22:54,162
It's him, it's the real Santa!

3037
01:22:54,197 --> 01:22:55,965
His sleigh won't fly,' cause nobody
believes in him!

3038
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:56,600
你看到公园里面有可疑人物？

3039
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,901
Did you see something
in the park?

3040
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:57,260
大家注意

3041
01:22:57,260 --> 01:22:59,770
我们要相信圣诞老人 我说的是实话

3042
01:22:57,936 --> 01:22:58,533
Everyone out there,

3043
01:22:58,568 --> 01:23:01,071
Santa needs us to believe,
I can prove he's real.

3044
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:00,630
这是他的名册

3045
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:03,640
是进一步的证明

3046
01:23:01,106 --> 01:23:01,903
Look, this is his list!

3047
01:23:01,938 --> 01:23:04,906
Okay... well, further confirmation

3048
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:06,210
今晚会看到圣诞老人了

3049
01:23:04,941 --> 01:23:07,510

sighting tonight.

圣诞老人是否存在 现在有了进一步证明

A confirmation that Santa must
have been sighted

Because we have his book right

3080

但巴迪还和 圣诞老人在公园里面

3110
01:24:10,338 --> 01:24:10,969
Yeah, I'm fine.

3111
01:24:11,004 --> 01:24:14,274
But buddy, he's... he's in the
park with Santa,

3112
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:14,210
雪橇飞不起来

3113
01:24:14,210 --> 01:24:16,210
因为缺少圣诞情绪

3114
01:24:14,309 --> 01:24:15,474
The sleigh won't fly

3115
01:24:15,509 --> 01:24:17,511
'cause there's no Christmas
spirit.

3116
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:18,480
-迈克尔！   -妈妈

3117
01:24:17,546 --> 01:24:20,381
Michael! Mom!

3118
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:21,910
迈克尔

3119
01:24:20,416 --> 01:24:23,181
Michael!

3120
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:24,220
-没事吧？   -还好

3121
01:24:23,216 --> 01:24:25,484
Are you okay? I'm fine.

3122
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:27,220
要得到大家信任

3123
01:24:25,519 --> 01:24:28,522
The best way to spread
Christmas cheer

3124
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:31,350
最好的办法是唱圣歌

3125
01:24:28,557 --> 01:24:32,651
Is singing loud for all
to hear.

3126
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:38,730
巴迪，要马上出发了 快上来

3127
01:24:36,996 --> 01:24:39,865
Buddy... better get going,
get in now!

3128
01:24:38,730 --> 01:24:41,430
但引擎还没有修好

3129
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:42,735
Santa, I'm not done with the
engine yet!

3130
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:42,740
不能等了

3131
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:45,340
快跑啊

3132
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:44,001
Can't wait!

3133
01:24:44,036 --> 01:24:46,522
On, dasher, on, dancer...

3134
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:47,700
引擎还没修好

3135
01:24:46,557 --> 01:24:49,008
I'm not done with the engine!

3136
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:52,750
没事的

3137
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:56,400
你先走，我随后到

3138
01:24:52,845 --> 01:24:54,010
That's okay.

3139
01:24:54,045 --> 01:24:57,344
You get started, I'll catch up!

3140
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:03,260
他没撒谎

3141
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:04,772
You know, he wasn't lying.

3142
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:06,200
圣诞快乐

3143
01:25:04,807 --> 01:25:07,325
Merry Christmas.

3144
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:12,800
圣诞老人，我不能…

3145
01:25:12,163 --> 01:25:14,063
Santa, I can't...

3146
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,400
不要说了，上来吧

3147
01:25:14,098 --> 01:25:16,701
Stop messing around and get in!

3148
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:18,730
啊

3149
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:25,950
他们为何要追赶我们？

3150
01:25:25,075 --> 01:25:27,177
Santa, why are they chasing us?!

3151
01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:27,980
我把他们列入坏孩子的名单

3152
01:25:27,212 --> 01:25:29,279
I put the mon the naughty list,

3153
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:30,410
他们不肯原谅我

3154
01:25:29,314 --> 01:25:31,713
And they never forgave me.

3155
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:39,960
你得小心，不许哭泣

3156
01:25:37,087 --> 01:25:40,907
You better watch out,
you better not cry

3157
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:43,430
不许生气，我来告知你原因

3158
01:25:40,942 --> 01:25:44,727
You better not pout,
I'm telling you why

3159
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:49,330
圣诞老人就要来镇上了

3160
01:25:44,762 --> 01:25:49,665
Santa Clausis coming' to town

3161
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:56,410
拉起来吧

3162
01:25:55,638 --> 01:25:57,672
Up, up, pull up!

3163
01:25:56,410 --> 01:26:00,910
巴迪！我们需要能量 否则就要散加了

3164
01:25:57,707 --> 01:26:02,044
Buddy! We need power, we're
gonna crash!

3165
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:05,800
他在列清单 而且还会重复看看

3166
01:26:02,079 --> 01:26:06,149
He's making a list,
Checking it twice

3167
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:08,920
看看谁是淘气谁是乖乖

3168
01:26:06,184 --> 01:26:10,218
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

3169
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:15,290
圣诞老人就要来镇上了

3170
01:26:10,253 --> 01:26:15,724
Santa clausis coming' to town

3171
01:26:15,290 --> 01:26:19,900
睡着的时候来到你身边

3172
01:26:15,759 --> 01:26:21,196
He sees you when you're sleeping

3173
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:22,800
趁你醒来前离去

3174
01:26:21,231 --> 01:26:24,064
He knows when you're awake

3175
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:26,610
他知道你是好孩子或坏孩子

3176
01:26:24,099 --> 01:26:27,902
He knows if you've been bad or good

3177
01:26:26,610 --> 01:26:29,380
所以你得听话了

3178
01:26:27,937 --> 01:26:30,637
So be good for goodness sake

3179
01:26:29,380 --> 01:26:34,800
你得小心，不许哭泣

3180
01:26:30,672 --> 01:26:35,008
Oh, you better watch out,
you better not cry

3181
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:38,500
不许生气，我来告知你原因

3182
01:26:35,043 --> 01:26:39,346
You better not pout, I'm telling
you why

3183
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:44,110
圣诞老人就要来镇上了

3184
01:26:39,381 --> 01:26:45,410
Santa Clausis coming to town

3185
01:26:51,530 --> 01:26:54,100
你们能行的，加油啊

3186
01:26:52,826 --> 01:26:55,396
You can do it!
Come on, dancer.

3187
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:56,840
好！

3188
01:26:55,431 --> 01:26:57,397
That's my boy.

3189
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:58,700
拉起来！

3190
01:26:57,432 --> 01:26:59,449
Pull, cupid!

3191
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:00,170
拉起来！

3192
01:26:59,484 --> 01:27:01,432
Pull, dasher!

3193
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:04,340
看来我老了

3194
01:27:01,467 --> 01:27:05,638
I'm getting too old for this job.

3195
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:05,870
现在

3196
01:27:05,673 --> 01:27:07,162
Now!

3197
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:20,860
引擎不见了

3198
01:27:20,452 --> 01:27:22,154
The engine's gone!

3199
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:22,900
这次死定了

3200
01:27:22,189 --> 01:27:23,388
We're toast!

3201
01:27:27,670 --> 01:27:29,940
还看不到圣诞老人

3202
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,194
Well, still no sign of Santa,

3203
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:32,000
但大众不约而同

3204
01:27:31,229 --> 01:27:33,298
But some spontaneous Christmas
caroling

3205
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:32,940
唱起了圣诞歌

3206
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:34,970
中央公园门前

3207
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:34,197
Has broken out

3208
01:27:34,232 --> 01:27:36,268
Right herein front of central
park.

3209
01:27:34,970 --> 01:27:36,400
我们来听听歌声

3210
01:27:36,303 --> 01:27:37,301
Let's have a listen in.

3211
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,880
睡着的时候来到你身边

3212
01:27:37,336 --> 01:27:39,171
He sees you when you're sleeping

3213
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:41,410
趁你醒来前离去

3214
01:27:39,206 --> 01:27:42,673
He knows if you're awake

3215
01:27:41,410 --> 01:27:45,380
他知道你是好孩子或坏孩子

3216
01:27:42,708 --> 01:27:46,677
He knows if you've been bad or
good

3217
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:49,190
所以你得听话了

3218
01:27:46,712 --> 01:27:50,481
So be good for goodness sake

3219
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:49,660
嗨

3220
01:27:49,660 --> 01:27:52,660
你得小心，不许哭泣

3221
01:27:50,948 --> 01:27:54,718
You better watch out, you better
not cry

3222
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:57,200
不许生气，我来告知你原因

3223
01:27:54,753 --> 01:27:58,489
You better not pout, I'm telling
you why

3224
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:57,600
来吧

3225
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:02,940
圣诞老人就要来镇上了

3226
01:27:58,524 --> 01:27:58,854
Come on!

3227
01:27:58,889 --> 01:28:03,174
Santa claus is coming' to town

3228
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:06,170
再用力点

3229
01:28:03,209 --> 01:28:07,459
Just a little more!

3230
01:28:12,450 --> 01:28:15,800
趁你醒来前离去

3231
01:28:12,502 --> 01:28:13,702
Hal-yah!

3232
01:28:13,737 --> 01:28:16,373
He knows when you're awake

3233
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:16,420
他知道你是

3234
01:28:16,408 --> 01:28:17,672
He knows if you've

3235
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:18,950
等等，你怎么不唱了

3236
01:28:17,707 --> 01:28:20,243
Wait... you're not singing.

3237
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:19,990
我唱了啊

3238
01:28:19,990 --> 01:28:23,190
你只是做口型而已

3239
01:28:20,278 --> 01:28:21,242
Yes, I am.

3240
01:28:21,277 --> 01:28:24,481
No, you're not. You're just moving
your lips.

3241
01:28:23,190 --> 01:28:25,600
圣诞老人

3242
01:28:24,516 --> 01:28:26,314
Santa!

3243
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,660
-迈克尔 -你忘了答应过的事情

3244
01:28:26,349 --> 01:28:28,952
Michael, please, what's the big deal?

3245
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:28,460
爸爸

3246
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:29,460
我来告诉你

3247
01:28:28,987 --> 01:28:29,718
Dad.

3248
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:35,230
圣诞老人就要来镇上了

3249
01:28:29,753 --> 01:28:30,719
I'm telling you why

3250
01:28:30,754 --> 01:28:36,521
Santa clausis coming to town

3251
01:28:45,610 --> 01:28:47,740
我的宝贝

3252
01:28:46,902 --> 01:28:49,037
Now, my beauties!

3253
01:28:54,990 --> 01:28:56,120
再见

3254
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:57,520
就像昔日时光

3255
01:28:56,278 --> 01:28:57,377
Bye-bye.

3256
01:28:57,412 --> 01:28:58,778
Just like the old days!

3257
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:00,590
夏洛特？

3258
01:28:58,813 --> 01:29:01,848
Charlotte? Charlotte?

3259
01:29:00,590 --> 01:29:03,300
或许我们都难以说清楚

3260
01:29:01,883 --> 01:29:04,585
Well, I guess we'll never know for
sure

3261
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:05,300
今年圣诞前夕

3262
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:06,587
What happened this Christmas Eve?

3263
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:06,670
在中央公园发生的事情

3264
01:29:06,622 --> 01:29:07,920
In central park.

3265
01:29:06,670 --> 01:29:12,800
圣诞快乐

3266
01:29:07,955 --> 01:29:14,095
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!

3267
01:29:14,130 --> 01:29:16,996
Ho ho ho!

3268
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:18,680
在大家的小许帮助下

3269
01:29:17,031 --> 01:29:19,932
And so, with a little help,

3270
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:20,650
巴迪拯救了圣诞节

3271
01:29:19,967 --> 01:29:21,900
Buddy managed to save Christmas.

3272
01:29:20,650 --> 01:29:23,550
他的精神也感动了不少人

3273
01:29:21,935 --> 01:29:24,838
And his spirit saved a lot of other
People, too.

3274
01:29:23,550 --> 01:29:30,320
我们该忘掉圣诞老人吗？

3275
01:29:24,873 --> 01:29:31,611
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

3276
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:36,700
从此不再想起

3277
01:29:31,646 --> 01:29:37,949
And never brought to mind

3278
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:44,000
我们该忘掉圣诞老人吗？

3279
01:29:37,984 --> 01:29:45,257
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

3280
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,540
沃特创办了自己的出版公司

3281
01:29:45,292 --> 01:29:48,828
Walter started his own independent
publishing company.

3282
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:49,810
他的首部发行作品

3283
01:29:48,863 --> 01:29:51,581
His first book was written by a
brand new,

3284
01:29:49,810 --> 01:29:53,100
作者是享有声誉的 儿童批评作家

3285
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:54,300
Critically acclaimed children's
author.

3286
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:54,650
故事关于精灵

3287
01:29:54,335 --> 01:29:56,102
The book was elf...

3288
01:29:54,650 --> 01:29:56,580
虚构的意味

3289
01:29:56,137 --> 01:29:57,835
A, uh, fictional story

3290
01:29:56,580 --> 01:29:59,150
主角是被收养的精灵巴迪

3291
01:29:57,870 --> 01:29:59,972
About an adopted elf named buddy

3292
01:29:59,150 --> 01:30:00,790
他在北极长大

3293
01:30:00,007 --> 01:30:02,041
Who was raised in the North Pole?

3294
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:02,790
想到纽约 而且喜欢吃意大利面条

3295
01:30:02,076 --> 01:30:04,076
Went to New York, ate spaghetti,

3296
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:04,260
在邮件收发室工作

3297
01:30:04,111 --> 01:30:06,462
Worked in a shiny mailroom,

3298
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:07,530
最后拯救了圣诞节

3299
01:30:06,497 --> 01:30:08,779
And eventually saved Christmas.

3300
01:30:07,530 --> 01:30:12,630
我在糖果森林连闯七关

3301
01:30:08,814 --> 01:30:11,583
"First, I traveled through the
seven levels

3302
01:30:11,618 --> 01:30:13,883
"Of the candy cane forest,

3303
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:17,240
来到水果糖的海洋

3304
01:30:13,918 --> 01:30:18,488
"Past the sea of twirly-swirly
gumdrops,

3305
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:22,700
然后穿过林肯大道

3306
01:30:18,523 --> 01:30:23,361
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel."

3307
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:24,340
我没有怨言

3308
01:30:23,396 --> 01:30:25,595
And as for me, I can't complain.

3309
01:30:24,340 --> 01:30:26,740
巴迪不时来探望我

3310
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:28,032
Buddy comes up to visit from time
to time.

3311
01:30:28,067 --> 01:30:31,603
In the meadow we can build a
snowman

3312
01:30:31,638 --> 01:30:35,103
And pretend that he is parson
brown

3313
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:37,600
谢谢你，乔维，你真好

3314
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:38,342
Oh, thank you, Jovie. That's very
sweet of you.

3315
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:38,580
不客气，爸爸

3316
01:30:38,377 --> 01:30:39,842
You're welcome, papa.

3317
01:30:39,877 --> 01:30:43,881
But you can do the job when
you're in town

3318
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:44,130
嗨，苏茜

3319
01:30:43,916 --> 01:30:45,380
Hey, Suzie.

3320
01:30:44,130 --> 01:30:45,600
过来，小宝贝

3321
01:30:45,415 --> 01:30:46,315
Come here, little one.

3322
01:30:46,350 --> 01:30:48,886
When it snows, ain't it
thrilling?

3323
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,900
爸爸要见你

3324
01:30:48,921 --> 01:30:50,352
Papa wants to see you.

3325
01:30:50,387 --> 01:30:53,991
Though your nose get a
little chilling

3326
01:30:52,710 --> 01:30:53,100
巴迪

3327
01:30:54,026 --> 01:30:54,356
Buddy...

3328
01:30:54,391 --> 01:30:56,658
We'll frolic and play buddy...
buddy...

3329
01:30:56,693 --> 01:31:02,961
The Eskimo way, walking in a
winter wonderland

3330
01:31:20,216 --> 01:31:24,436
In the meadow we can build a
snowman

3331
01:31:24,471 --> 01:31:28,622
And pretend that he is parson
brown

3332
01:31:28,657 --> 01:31:33,061
He'll say, are you married,
we'll say no, man

3333
01:31:33,096 --> 01:31:37,465
But you can do the job when you
in town, brother

3334
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:42,070
Later on, we'll conspire

3335
01:31:42,105 --> 01:31:46,606
As we dream by the fire

3336
01:31:46,641 --> 01:31:51,078
To face unafraid the plans
That we made

3337
01:31:51,113 --> 01:31:55,411
Walking in a winter wonderland

3338
01:31:55,446 --> 01:31:59,710
Walking in a winter wonderland

3339
01:32:11,165 --> 01:32:12,597
I really can't stay

3340
01:32:12,632 --> 01:32:17,136
But, baby, it's cold outside

3341
01:32:17,171 --> 01:32:18,202
I've got to go 'way

3342
01:32:18,237 --> 01:32:21,975
But, baby, it's cold outside

3343
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:24,242
This evening has been

3344
01:32:24,277 --> 01:32:27,013
Been hoping that you'd drop in

3345
01:32:27,048 --> 01:32:28,413
So very nice

3346
01:32:28,448 --> 01:32:33,653
I'll hold your hands, they're
just like ice

3347
01:32:33,688 --> 01:32:36,205
My mother will start to worry

3348
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:38,689
Beautiful, what's your hurry?

3349
01:32:38,724 --> 01:32:42,127
And father will be pacing the floor

3350
01:32:42,162 --> 01:32:44,663
Listen to that fireplace roar

3351
01:32:44,698 --> 01:32:47,116
So, really, I'd better scurry

3352
01:32:47,151 --> 01:32:49,499
Beautiful, please don't hurry

3353
01:32:49,534 --> 01:32:52,670
Well, maybe just a half a drink more

3354
01:32:52,705 --> 01:32:55,807
Put some records on while I pour

3355
01:32:55,842 --> 01:32:58,193
The neighbors might think

3356
01:32:58,228 --> 01:33:00,253
Baby, it's bad out there

3357
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:03,386
Say, what's in this drink?

3358
01:33:03,421 --> 01:33:06,484
No cabs to be had out there

3359
01:33:06,519 --> 01:33:08,184
I wish I knew how

3360
01:33:08,219 --> 01:33:10,588
Your eyes are like starlight now

3361
01:33:10,623 --> 01:33:12,521
To break the spell

3362
01:33:12,556 --> 01:33:17,595
I'll take your hat, your hair
looks swell

3363
01:33:17,630 --> 01:33:20,531
I ought to say no, no, no, sir

3364
01:33:20,566 --> 01:33:22,632
Mind if I move in closer?

3365
01:33:22,667 --> 01:33:25,852
At least I'm gonna say that I
tried

3366
01:33:25,887 --> 01:33:29,039
What's the sense of hurting
my pride?

3367
01:33:29,074 --> 01:33:30,941
I really can't stay

3368
01:33:30,976 --> 01:33:32,774
Baby, don't hold out

3369
01:33:32,809 --> 01:33:39,806
Ah, but it's cold outside

3370
01:33:48,091 --> 01:33:49,323
I simply must go

3371
01:33:49,358 --> 01:33:53,328
But, baby, it's cold outside

3372
01:33:53,363 --> 01:33:55,262
The answer is no

3373
01:33:55,297 --> 01:33:58,567
But, baby, it's cold outside

3374
01:33:58,602 --> 01:34:00,334
This welcome has been

3375
01:34:00,369 --> 01:34:03,072
I'm lucky that you dropped in

3376
01:34:03,107 --> 01:34:05,005
So nice and warm

3377
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:10,079
Look out the window at that
storm

3378
01:34:10,114 --> 01:34:12,731
My sister will be suspicious

3379
01:34:12,766 --> 01:34:15,314
Gosh, your lips look delicious

3380
01:34:15,349 --> 01:34:18,586
My brother will be there at
the door

3381
01:34:18,621 --> 01:34:20,787
Waves upon tropical shore

3382
01:34:20,822 --> 01:34:23,558
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious

3383
01:34:23,593 --> 01:34:26,259
Oh, your lips look delicious

3384
01:34:26,294 --> 01:34:28,696
Well, maybe just a cigarette more

3385
01:34:28,731 --> 01:34:32,233
Never such a pleasure before

3386
01:34:32,268 --> 01:34:34,033
I've got to get home

3387
01:34:34,068 --> 01:34:36,804
But, baby, you'll freeze out there

3388
01:34:36,839 --> 01:34:38,603
Say, lend me your comb

3389
01:34:38,638 --> 01:34:42,642
It's up to your knees out there

3390
01:34:42,677 --> 01:34:44,710
You've really been grand

3391
01:34:44,745 --> 01:34:46,780
I thrill when you touch my hand

3392
01:34:46,815 --> 01:34:48,880
But don't you see

3393
01:34:48,915 --> 01:34:52,652
How can you do this thing to me?

3394
01:34:52,687 --> 01:34:56,389
There's bound to be talk tomorrow

3395
01:34:56,424 --> 01:34:59,558
Think of my lifelong sorrow

3396
01:34:59,593 --> 01:35:02,328
At least there will be plenty
implied

3397
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:05,331
If you caught pneumonia and died

3398
01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:06,897
I really can't stay

3399
01:35:06,932 --> 01:35:09,401
Get rid of that hold out

3400
01:35:09,436 --> 01:35:13,405
Ah, but it's cold

3401
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:19,139
Outside
