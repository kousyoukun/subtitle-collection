1
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:26,830
Oh, hello.

2
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,670
You're, uh, you're probably here

3
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,710
About the, Uh, the story.

4
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,670
Elves love to tell stories.

5
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,390
I- I'll bet you didn't know that
about elves.

6
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,630
There's, uh, probably a lot of things

7
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,790
You... you didn't know about elves.

8
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,270
Another... another interesting
Uh, elf ism

9
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:49,510
Uh, there are only three jobs available
to an elf.

10
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,070
The first is making shoes at night

11
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,630
While, you know, while the old...

12
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,190
The old cobbler sleeps.

13
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,150
Lazy bum. Couldn't even make a clog.

14
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,710
You can bake cookies

15
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,470
In a tree. Hey!

16
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,510
As you can imagine, it's, uh, dangerous
Having an oven

17
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,870
In an oak tree during the dry season.

18
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,510
I wanna make shoes!

19
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,990
But the third job... uh, some call
It, uh,

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,150
"The show," or... or "the big dance,"

21
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,110
It's the profession that every elf
Aspires to,

22
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,070
And that is to build toys in
Santa's workshop.

23
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,230
Only two weeks left till Christmas!

24
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,590
I- It's a job only an elf can do.

25
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,950
Our... our nimble fingers,

26
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,630
Natural cheer and active minds

27
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,270
Are perfect for toy-building.

28
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,150
They... they tried using gnomes
And trolls,

29
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,910
But the gnomes drank too much...

30
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,070
...and the trolls weren't toilet
trained.

31
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:44,470
No human being has ever set... set
foot in Santa's workshop.

32
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,190
Uh, that is until about 30 years ago,

33
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,030
And, as you may have guessed,

34
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,870
That's where our story begins.

35
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,070
Wow!

36
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,230
Whoa!

37
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,710
Ooh!

38
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,230
Wow!

39
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,750
Wow!

40
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,390
Ow! Ow!

41
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,110
Whoa!

42
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,030
Are you sleepy?

43
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,710
Here we are.

44
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,150
We're just going to make you feel
so comfortable.

45
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,110
Here we are.

46
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,030
There you are.

47
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:52,150
It's time to go to sleep.

48
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,550
Maybe by next Christmas you'll
Have a home.

49
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,430
Merry Christmas, my ángel.

50
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,630
Mmm...

51
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,310
All right, all right.

52
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,710
We've had another very successful
year.

53
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,910
So, after all that hard work,

54
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,390
It's time to start preparations

55
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,950
For next Christmas!

56
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,950
What in the name of Sam hill
Is that?

57
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,630
Wow...

58
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,470
A baby...

59
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,230
"little buddy diapers."

60
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,270
His name is buddy. He must've...

61
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,590
Snuck into your sack at the
orphanage.

62
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,030
What do we do?

63
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,070
So, Santa had a
Decision to make,

64
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,110
And fortunately, when it
Comes to babies,

65
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,350
Santa's a... a pushover.

66
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,510
So, buddy stayed with, uh
An older elf

67
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,390
Who had always wanted a child?

68
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,870
But had been so committed to
Building toys, he...

69
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:12,510
He, well, had forgotten to
Settle down.

70
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,070
Santa.

71
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,230
Yes, yes, I... I raised buddy.

72
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,350
I was his adopted father.

73
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,030
Though buddy grew twice as fast,

74
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:24,110
He... he wasn't any different from
the other children.

75
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,670
Chuckles not too fast, buddy.

76
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,150
I mean, not... not really.

77
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,990
Before we learn how to build
The latest

78
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,230
In extreme graphic chipset
Processors,

79
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,430
Let's recite the
"Code of the elves,"

80
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,270
Shall we?

81
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,030
Number one.

82
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,910
"Treat every day like Christmas."

83
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,630
Number two.

84
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,510
"There's room for everyone on the
Nice list."

85
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,550
Number three.

86
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,830
"The best way to spread Christmas
Cheer

87
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,510
Is singing loud for all to hear."

88
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,270
And one day, when buddy was
old enough,

89
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,390
I made him my own personal
apprentice.

90
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,390
I've never been in this room
before.

91
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,350
Well, I think it's time you start

92
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,230
Your tinker training.

93
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:07,110
Santa's sleigh.

94
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,670
You're gonna help me make it fly.

95
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,590
I thought the magical reindeer made
The sleighs fly.

96
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,270
And where do the reindeer get
their magic from?

97
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,590
Christmas spirit. Everybody
knows that.

98
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,630
Well, silly as it sounds,

99
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,550
A lot of people down south

100
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,430
Don't believe in Santa Claus.

101
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,150
What?!

102
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,270
Well, who do they think puts all?
their toys under the tree?

103
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,110
Well, there's a rumor floating around

104
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,950
That, uh, that the parents do it.

105
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,790
That's... that's ridiculous.

106
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,710
I mean, parents couldn't do that
all in one night.

107
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,790
What about Santa's cookies?

108
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,150
I suppose parents eat them, too?

109
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,150
Yeah, I, uh, I... I know,

110
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,550
Uh, and every earless and less
People

111
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,190
Believe in Santa Claus.

112
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,550
I mean, we have a real energy
crisis on our hands.

113
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,990
Oh.

114
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,790
I mean, just see how low the, uh
Claus meter is.

115
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,510
That's shocking.

116
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,190
That's why I came up

117
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,510
With this little beauty in the '60s.

118
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,110
WH-what is it?

119
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,550
It's a cringle 3000...

120
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,110
A 500-reindeer power jet turbine
engine.

121
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,550
Without it, the sleigh couldn't

122
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,350
Get more than, uh, a few feet off
the ground.

123
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,630
Well, it looks like we got

124
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,590
A short in the thermo coupler.

125
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,510
You wanna give mea hand with that?

126
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,950
You want me to help?

127
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,230
As much as, uh, buddy was accepted

128
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,310
By his family and friends,

129
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,350
There were a few drawbacks

130
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,990
To being, uh, a human in, uh
an elf's world.

131
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,230
Hey, Ming Ming.

132
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,150
Um...

133
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,390
I'm gonna be a little bit short
on today's quota.

134
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,350
It's all right, buddy.

135
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,870
Just how many etch-a-sketches

136
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,030
Did you get finished?

137
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:11,110
Come on, buddy. How many?

138
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:15,230
I made, uh... 85.

139
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,510
Eighty-five?

140
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,950
That puts you...

141
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,790
915 off the pace.

142
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,310
Ooh... that's bad.

143
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,630
Why don't you just say it?

144
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,110
I'm the worst toy maker in
the world.

145
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,510
I'm a cotton-headed ninny-muggins.

146
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,790
No, buddy, you're not cotton-
headed ninny-muggins.

147
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,790
We all just have different talents
That's all.

148
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,630
Seems like everyone else

149
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,070
Have the same talents
except for me.

150
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,790
You... you have, you have lots of
Talents, uh...

151
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,150
Special talents in fact, like
Um, uh...

152
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,910
Special talents?

153
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,510
You changed the batteries in the
smoke detector.

154
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,270
You sure did... aaa's.

155
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,350
And in six months, you'll have
to check 'em again...

156
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,070
Won't he?

157
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,710
And you're the only baritone in
the elf choir.

158
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,830
You bring us down whole octave.

159
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,110
In a good way.

160
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,350
See, buddy?

161
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,430
You're not a cotton-headed ninny-
muggings.

162
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,110
You're just... special.

163
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:15,870
And so, buddy was sent where the...
The special elves work.

164
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,910
Aah!

165
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,270
Ah!

166
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,270
Hey, foom foom...

167
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,510
I hate to do this to you, but you
Think you could

168
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,710
Help me pick up the slack on those
etch-a-sketches?

169
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,750
No problem. I appreciate it.

170
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,390
Buddy is killing me.

171
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,870
I already got lum lum and choochoo pulling' doubles.

172
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,350
That was quick thinking yesterday

173
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,750
With that ¡°special talents¡± thing.

174
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,030
I feel bad for the guy.

175
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,230
I just hope he doesn't get wise.

176
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,710
Well, if he hasn't figured out
He's a human by now,

177
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,990
I don't think he ever will.

178
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,030
If he hasn't figured
Out he's a human

179
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,590
By now, I don't think he ever will.

180
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,350
I think they're too small.

181
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:32,070
You're just... special.

182
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,030
You don't look so good, buddy.

183
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:51,510
Are you okay?

184
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,910
I'll be okay, I just need a glass
of water.

185
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,990
Aah!

186
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,910
Buddy...

187
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,070
Unh! Aah!

188
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,550
Buddy, are you okay?

189
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,430
I'm sorry, papa.

190
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,790
I just need some alone time.

191
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,270
Buddy, I... I think we... we have
to talk.

192
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,310
Buddy, uh, I think there's something

193
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,270
I... I probably should tell you.

194
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,630
You probably should have found
out a long...

195
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,750
A long time ago.

196
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,710
I then proceeded to tell buddy of
how his father

197
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,510
Had fallen in love when he was
very young

198
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,310
With a beautiful girl named
Susan wells,

199
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,390
And how buddy was born

200
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,830
And put up for adoption by
his mother,

201
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,670
And how she had later passed away.

202
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,630
I... I told him his father

203
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,070
Had never even known that
Buddy was born,

204
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:57,790
And most importantly,

205
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,630
I told him where his father was...

206
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,590
Uh, in a magical land called
new York City.

207
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,870
My dad works there?

208
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,070
Empire state building.

209
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,430
Hey, buddy, wanna pick some
snow berries?

210
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,190
Not now, arctic puffin.

211
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,750
Hello, buddy. Oh... hi, Leon.

212
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,550
Why the long face, partner?

213
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,750
It seems I'm... I'm not an elf.

214
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,310
'Course you're not. You're 6'3"

215
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,830
And had a beard since you were 15.

216
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,870
Papa says my real father

217
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,950
Lives in a magical place far away.

218
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,950
I don't know what to do.

219
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,910
At least you have a daddy.

220
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,990
I was just rolled up one day and
left out here in the cold.

221
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,590
But the thing is, I've never even left
the North Pole.

222
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,870
Buddy, I've been around the world
Many times

223
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,110
When I was a young cumulus
nimbus cloud.

224
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,830
It's a wonderful place, filled with
Wondrous creatures...

225
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,310
Except dogs.

226
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,110
Oh, by the way, don't eat the
yellow snow.

227
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:55,670
Oh, I know that.

228
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,630
All I'm say in' is, this might be
The golden opportunity

229
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,310
To find out whom you really are.

230
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,230
So, I hear you're going

231
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,070
On a little journey to
the big city.

232
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,190
Yup. Ahh.

233
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,430
I'm kind a nervous.

234
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,910
Leon says New York is pretty
different.

235
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:15,910
Oh, don't pay attention to Leon.

236
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,750
He's never been anywhere.
He doesn't have any feet.

237
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,270
I've been to New York thousands
of times.

238
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,270
Really? Mm-hmm.

239
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,150
What's it like?

240
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,910
Well, there are some things you
should know.

241
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,430
First off, you see gum on
The street,

242
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,870
Leave it there. It's not
free candy.

243
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,030
Oh. Second,

244
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,510
There are, like, 30 ray's
pizzas.

245
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,950
They all claim to be the
Original,

246
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,510
But the real one' son 11th.

247
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,070
And if you see a sign that
Says "peep show,"

248
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,550
That doesn't mean that
They're letting you

249
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,670
Look at presents before Christmas.

250
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,470
Can't wait to see my dad...

251
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,830
We're gonna go ices skating and...
And eat sugar plums.

252
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,030
Yeah, that's the other thing

253
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,990
I wanted to talk to you about.

254
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,510
You know, buddy...

255
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,950
Your father...

256
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,270
Well... he's on the naughty list.

257
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:08,590
No!

258
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:13,510
You're taking the books back?

259
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,710
See, I... I see what you're trying
to do here.

260
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,510
Y- You're trying to make me feel bad,

261
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,230
When, in actuality, you're the one

262
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,230
That missed the payments.

263
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:25,030
But the children love the books.

264
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:25,830
I know that, uh...

265
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,030
You know, I'm the one that ran
The focus groups,

266
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,430
But I like hearing that.

267
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,710
Listen, some people, they just
Lose sight

268
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,430
Of what's important in life.

269
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:40,030
That doesn't mean they can't find
their way again, huh?

270
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:40,830
Maybe all they need

271
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,390
Is just a little Christmas spirit.

272
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,670
Well, uh, I... I'm good at that.

273
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,070
I know you are.

274
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,230
And I'll...

275
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:04,950
I'll always, uh,

276
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,870
I'll always be here for you.

277
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,390
Now, uh...

278
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,710
Go... uh, get.

279
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:29,950
Bye, guys.

280
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,110
Bye, buddy. Bye, buddy. Take care.

281
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,030
Bye-bye.

282
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,110
Bye-bye.

283
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,350
Bye-bye, buddy.

284
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,870
There, there.

285
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,910
Huh?

286
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,710
Oh! Ohh!

287
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:54,390
Bye, buddy. Hope you find your dad.

288
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,310
Thanks, Mr. Narwhal.

289
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,470
Bye.

290
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,390
Hey! What's your name?

291
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,030
My name's buddy.

292
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,390
Ohh!

293
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,710
Does someone need a hug?

294
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,150
aah, aah! That's not cool!

295
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,230
I just wanted a hug!

296
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,030
Hi.

297
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,550
Hello.

298
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,550
Thank you.

299
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,350
Thank you.

300
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:11,470
You did it! Congratulations!

301
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:16,270
"World's best cup of coffee.
"Great job, everybody.

302
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,870
It's great to meet you.

303
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,390
Hi.

304
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,830
Santa, san... uh, nope.

305
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,470
Not Santa.

306
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,030
Thank you.

307
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,550
Thank you.

308
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,910
Thank you. Hey, you know what?
No.

309
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,270
No, all right? Thank you.

310
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,710
Get outta here, get outta here.

311
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,150
Hello. Hi.

312
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,230
Ooh...

313
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:12,950
Beautiful.

314
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,190
Looks like a Christmas tree.

315
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,390
A reprint?

316
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,230
You know how much that's gonna
cost?

317
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,350
Two whole pages are missing.

318
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,550
The story doesn't make any sense.

319
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,750
What, you think some kid's gonna
notice two pages?

320
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,910
I mean, they... all they do is look
at pictures.

321
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:41,030
Sorry I can't ride with you the
Rest of the way up,

322
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,630
But this is where my dad works.
Well, have a good...

323
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,790
Oh, I forgot to give you a hug!

324
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,710
Oh, I don't know, Connie,
I've never

325
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,110
Declared kittens before.

326
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,030
How many?

327
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,510
Eight?

328
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,350
Uh, I don't know if I'm gonna
Have time.

329
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,750
Oh, all right, just bring 'em by
The camper this week,

330
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,110
And I'll see what I can do. I'm
Not gonna charge you.

331
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,510
Just bring 'em by, and I'll see
What I can do.

332
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,150
I have to go. Excuse me.

333
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,430
I'm here to see a Walter hobs.

334
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,830
I'm buddy the elf. Laughs

335
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,310
You look hilarious! Who sent you?

336
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,190
Papa elf. Papa elf?

337
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,870
Mm-hmm. From the North Pole.

338
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,470
From the North Pole? Yes.

339
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,110
So, you really think we should
Ship 'em?

340
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,390
No, I think we should take a
$30,000 bath

341
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,630
So some kid can understand
What happened?

342
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,230
To a puppy and a frigging pigeon

343
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,070
ship 'em.

344
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,830
Yeah.

345
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,470
Mr. Hobbs? It's me on the intercom.

346
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:29,870
Go ahead.

347
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:33,350
Yeah, I think some one sent you a
Christmas-gram.

348
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,950
Dad!

349
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,590
All right, uh, let's get it
Over with.

350
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,270
I walked all day and night to
Find you.

351
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:47,110
Uh, you look like you came from
the North Pole.

352
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,670
That's exactly where I came from.

353
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,310
Santa must've called you!

354
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,830
Oh, yeah, sure, he, uh...

355
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,710
Just got off the cell phone
with me.

356
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,910
You did?!

357
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,270
So, go on. Go on with what?

358
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,470
Well, are... are you gonna sing a
Song or something,

359
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,150
Or can I just go back to work?

360
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,910
A song? Uh...

361
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:10,110
Yeah. Anything for you, dad, uh...

362
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:15,310
I... I'm, I'm here with my dad

363
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,030
And we never met

364
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:19,750
And he wants me to sing
Him a song

365
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,190
And, um, I was adopted

366
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,470
But you didn't know I was born

367
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:27,790
So, I'm here now, I found you,
Daddy

368
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,990
And, guess what? I love you

369
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:33,630
I love you I love you!

370
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,710
Wow, that was weird.

371
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,470
You know, usually you guys just
Uh, you know,

372
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,190
Put my name into jingle bells or
something.

373
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:42,950
It's me, your son.

374
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,070
Susan wells had me, and... And she
Didn't tell you,

375
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,470
And, and, and, but now I'm here...

376
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,670
It's me buddy.

377
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,790
Susan wells.

378
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,990
Uh, you said Susan wells? Yes.

379
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,190
Who sent this Christmas-gram?

380
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,270
What's a Christmas-gram?
I want one.

381
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,270
It's okay, Walter's my father.

382
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,630
Well, your dad's busy right now.

383
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,830
Okay, I'll come back later.

384
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,270
Yeah, you know, you're not gonna

385
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,270
Come back for awhile, okay?

386
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,190
You're gonna go back to
Santa land.

387
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:13,670
Okay.

388
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,830
Yeah, why don't you go back?
to gimbals'?

389
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,710
Sorry! Sorry.

390
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,790
Passion fruit spray?

391
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,030
Fruit spray? Sure.

392
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,670
Sorry.

393
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,630
Sorry.

394
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,710
Do you wanna go?

395
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,950
Hey! Have you seen these?
toilets?

396
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,550
They're gl-normous!

397
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,270
"For that special someone."

398
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,670
Past!

399
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,990
Grunts

400
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,470
Hey, come... come here!

401
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,270
Me? Yes.

402
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,790
What are you doing down here?

403
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,470
You're not supposed to be
Down here!

404
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,630
You can shop on your break,

405
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,430
You don't... come on, get upstairs!

406
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,150
Okay, I didn't know. Well
You should know!

407
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,110
Are you mad at me? No.

408
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,710
Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure.

409
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,990
Just do your job.

410
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,270
Okay, fair enough.

411
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,430
wow!

412
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,510
What's this?

413
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,190
This is the North Pole.

414
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,750
No, it's not. Yes, it is.

415
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,230
No, it's not. Yes, it is.

416
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,750
No, it isn't. Yes, it is.

417
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,190
No, it isn't. Yes, it is.

418
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:26,030
No, it's not. Where's the snow?

419
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,470
Why you smiling like that?

420
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,910
I just like to smile, smiling's
my favorite.

421
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,590
Make work your favorite, that's
You're favorite, okay?

422
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,390
Okay. Work is your new favorite.

423
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:34,990
Fine.

424
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,710
It's time for the announcement.

425
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,110
Okay.

426
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:40,110
Okay, people, tomorrow
morning 10 a.m.,

427
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,550
Santa's coming' to town!

428
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,950
Santa!

429
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,350
Oh, my god!

430
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:48,630
Santa here?! I know him.

431
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,390
I know him.

432
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,870
He'll be hereto take pictures

433
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,310
With all the children.

434
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,750
Yeah!

435
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:55,310
Just keep your receipts.
10 a.m. Tomorrow.

436
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,230
10 a.m. Tomorrow.

437
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,310
Santa's coming to town.

438
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,310
Yes. Can you sign this for me?

439
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,910
Ohh! Hi.

440
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,790
Are you enjoying the view?

441
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:26,950
You are very good at decorating
that tree.

442
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,870
Why are you messing with me?

443
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,790
Did krumpet put you up to this?

444
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,150
I'm not messing with you.

445
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,070
It's just nice to meet
Another human

446
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,510
Who shares my affinity for?
elf culture.

447
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,870
I'm just trying to get
through the holidays.

448
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:39,310
Get through?

449
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:42,710
Christmas is the greatest
Day in the whole wide world!

450
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,190
Please stop talking to me.

451
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,590
Uh-oh. Sounds like someone

452
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,670
Needs to sing a Christmas
Carol.

453
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,190
Go away.

454
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,910
The best way to
Spread Christmas cheer

455
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,510
Is singing loud for all to hear.

456
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,590
Thanks, but I don't sing.

457
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,990
Oh, it's easy, it's just like
Talking...

458
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:55,870
Except louder and longer

459
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,070
And you move your voice up
And down.

460
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,710
I can sing, but I just choose not
to sing.

461
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,830
Especially in front of other
people.

462
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,830
Well, if you sing alone,
You can sing

463
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,430
In front of other people. There's
no difference.

464
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,910
Actually, there's a big difference.

465
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,790
No, there... no, there isn't.

466
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,190
Wait.

467
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:12,910
I'm singing

468
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:16,150
I'm in a store, and I'm singing

469
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,350
I'm in a store, and I'm singing

470
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:22,670
Hey! There's no singing in the
North Pole.

471
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,950
Yes, there is.

472
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,150
No, there's not.

473
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,510
We sing all the time.
No, there's not.

474
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,030
Especially when we make toys.

475
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,710
See?

476
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,950
Attention,
all gimbel's shoppers,

477
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,310
Please make your final purchases.

478
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,070
We'll be closing in ten minutes.

479
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:40,750
Well, it's time for me to go home.

480
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:44,310
But... but Santa's coming,
There's so much to do.

481
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:47,470
Yeah, um... laughs

482
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,950
I'll see you tomorrow...

483
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,990
Buddy. Jovie.

484
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:55,030
Hi. Hi.

485
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,790
Jovie.

486
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,750
Hey, uh... I'm gonna eat in the
bedroom, okay?

487
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,790
I, uh, I got

488
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,430
A bunch of stuff to go over.

489
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,710
Are you sure? I'm... I'm just way
Behind

490
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,470
On a bunch of stuff.

491
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,750
Okay.

492
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,710
Can I eat in my room?

493
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,150
No. Why not?

494
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,150
Dad's eating in his room.

495
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,470
I got a bunch
Of homework to go over,

496
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,750
And I'm way behind on a bunch
of stuff.

497
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,150
You're eating here.

498
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:51,390
I really can't stay

499
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:54,830
I've got to go 'way

500
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:58,270
This evening has been

501
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:01,590
So very nice

502
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:05,470
My mother will start to worry

503
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:09,870
And father will be pacing'
The floor

504
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:13,990
So, really, I'd better scurry

505
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:18,670
Well, may be just a half a drink
More

506
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:23,070
The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there

507
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,470
Say, what's in this drink?

508
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,830
No cabs to be had out there

509
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:32,870
I wish I knew how to break the
Spell

510
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:36,950
I'll take your hat, your hair
Looks swell

511
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:39,350
I ought to say no, no, no, sir

512
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,270
Mind if I move in closer?

513
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,590
At least I'm gonna say that
I tried

514
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,870
What's the sense of hurting?
my pride?

515
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:48,590
I really can't stay

516
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:55,710
Ah, but it's cold outside baby,
it's cold outside!

517
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,870
Get out! Don't look at me!

518
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,270
Get out!

519
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,190
Just hear those sleigh bells
Jingling

520
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:23,510
Ring-ting-tingling, too

521
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,710
Come on, it's lovely weather

522
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:29,590
For a sleigh ride together
With you

523
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,870
Outside the snow is falling

524
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:34,110
And friends are calling yoo-hoo

525
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:34,990
Dad?

526
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,070
Come on, its lovely weather dad.

527
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:40,390
Dad, hi! It's me! For a sleigh
Ride together with you

528
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,150
Buddy. Dad! Dad! Dad!

529
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:45,510
Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap

530
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:48,830
Let's go, let's look at the show

531
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:53,590
We're riding in a wonderland
Of snow

532
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,550
Hey! It's okay,

533
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,150
I just have a gift for my dad.

534
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:56,990
Okay, I'll take this.

535
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,550
Okay. Well, just make sure he knows

536
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,950
It's from me buddy, his son, okay?

537
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:01,230
Okay. And that I love him so much,

538
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,710
And that I think he's the greatest
dad in the world.

539
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,910
You guys are so strong.

540
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,310
Wow! My cheeks are nice
And rosy

541
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:10,510
This is neat. And comfy
Cozy are we

542
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:13,550
We're snuggled up together

543
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:17,390
Like two birds of a feather
Would be

544
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:20,150
Let's take that road before us

545
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:22,910
And sing a chorus or two

546
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,590
Come on, it's lovely weather

547
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:30,350
For a sleigh ride together
With you

548
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,430
Hey, you. Me?

549
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:43,150
Come here. I wanna talk to you.

550
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,230
What do you wanna talk to?
Me about?

551
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:46,870
How come you were

552
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,350
In the women's locker room these
morning?

553
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,030
I heard you singing.

554
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,350
You sure it had nothing to
Do with the fact

555
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,950
That I was naked in the shower?

556
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,070
I didn't know you were naked.

557
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,630
Why were you here so early?

558
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,150
They shut my water off.

559
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:01,910
What were you doing here so
early?

560
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,150
Building this.

561
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,310
You built this? Mm-hmm.

562
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,910
They're kind a pissed about
this.

563
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:11,190
Really?

564
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,270
Hey, guys.

565
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,270
Have you seen the place?
Mm-hmm.

566
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,310
It's pretty good. It's a
little too good.

567
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,310
Corporate must have sent in a
professional.

568
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,110
I don't know why some body's
Gunning' for my job,

569
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:24,590
But, look... let's
Remain team, okay?

570
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,470
'Cause if I go, we all go.

571
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,310
If you get wind of anything,

572
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,830
Call me on my radio,
Channel three.

573
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,750
Code word is "Santa's got
A brand new bag,"

574
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,030
Okay?

575
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:38,430
Six-inch ribbon curis, honey.

576
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:41,310
That's impossible. Six... inches.

577
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,430
By the way... I think you have

578
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,150
The most beautiful singing voice

579
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,030
In the whole wide world.

580
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,870
Santa...

581
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:01,310
Hey, hey! Ho ho ho!

582
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,830
Yeah!

583
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,590
Santa, it's me buddy!

584
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,510
It's me! Hey, buddy,
How you doing?

585
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,430
It's me!

586
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,030
Are you ready to see Santa?

587
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,390
Who the heck are you?

588
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,870
What are you talking about?
I'm Santa Claus.

589
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:16,670
No, you're not.

590
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:19,710
Uh, WH-why, of course I am!

591
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,670
Ho ho ho ho ho!

592
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,430
Well, if you're Santa...

593
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,510
What song did I sing for you on?
Your birthday this year?

594
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:28,990
Uh, happy birthday of course!

595
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,070
Ho ho ho ho ho!

596
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,990
Uh, so, how old are you, son?

597
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:33,510
Four.

598
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,870
You're a big boy, what's
your name?

599
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:37,350
Paul. And, uh, what can I
get you for Christmas?

600
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,550
Paul... don't tell him what
You want.

601
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,830
He's a liar. Let the kid talk.

602
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:44,030
You disgust me. How can you live?
With yourself?

603
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:46,110
Just cool it, zippy. Woman:
Smile.

604
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,830
You sit on a throne of lies.

605
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,950
Look, I'm not kidding'.
You're a fake.

606
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:50,870
I'm a fake? Yes.

607
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:53,150
How'd you like to be dead, huh?

608
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:56,030
Fake. No, he's kidding.

609
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:56,510
You stink.

610
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,750
I think you're gonna have a good
Christmas, all right?

611
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,430
You smell like beef and cheese.

612
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,030
You don't smell like Santa.

613
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,230
Okay.

614
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:07,590
He's an imposter! He's not
Santa!

615
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:12,350
He's a fake! He's a fake!
Come here. Come here!

616
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,790
I saw!

617
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,190
He's a fake!

618
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,870
Ha ha! Where you going now?
Where you going...?

619
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:30,910
Ohh! Ohh!

620
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,550
No!

621
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,670
He's not Santa Claus!

622
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,390
He's not Santa!

623
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,190
"To someone special."

624
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:14,950
What's that? Intercom.

625
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,950
All right.

626
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:23,390
Yeah? Mr. Hobbs, the police are
On line one.

627
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:26,070
Police. Hello?

628
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:44,470
Dad!

629
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,630
I knew that you'd come,
I love you for coming.

630
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,150
Officer tom, this is my dad.

631
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,630
This is Walter... he came.

632
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,390
He bailed me out.

633
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,590
They gave me one phone call.

634
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,710
They gave me one phone call,

635
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,110
And I said," I know who
I'm gonna call...

636
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:55,750
Walter Hobbs."

637
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:56,710
And sure enough, you showed up.

638
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,670
You did, they said you weren't
goanna show up.

639
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,230
They told me so many times...
shh shh shh shh shh.

640
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,750
Just who the heck are you,
And what is your problem?

641
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,790
I- I'm buddy, I'm your son.

642
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:06,830
Wait, um...

643
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,670
Tell me, tell me, tell me, uh...

644
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,430
Where'd you get this picture?

645
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,910
Papa elf gave it to me.

646
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,710
Listen... is this some kind a
game?

647
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,190
What do you want, some money?

648
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,630
No! I just wanted to meet you,

649
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:21,750
And I thought you might Anna
Meet me.

650
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,710
Who wouldn't Anna meet you?

651
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:31,150
I thought maybe we could make
Gingerbread houses,

652
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,550
And eat cookie dough, and go
Ice skating, and...

653
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,670
And maybe even hold hands.

654
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,350
Uh-huh.

655
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,390
Come with me. Okay.

656
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:49,830
Okay. What have we got here?

657
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:00,190
Buddy, don't eat those.

658
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,350
Ohh!

659
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,670
We got to really hurry up, Walter,

660
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:10,230
'cause I'm double booked the
rest of the afternoon.

661
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:10,710
Am I sick?

662
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,950
Yeah, but that's not why we're
Here.

663
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:12,910
We're hereto do a test, come on.

664
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:13,910
What kind test? Just a test to
Find out

665
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,990
If you're my son or not. Why am
I sitting on paper?

666
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,950
Because it's sanitary for the
other patients.

667
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,830
Now, sit still so I can do
the finger prick.

668
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,390
Finger prick!

669
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,870
Ohh! It's cold.

670
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:23,910
Yeah, just pleases it still,
Please?

671
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:24,910
Okay, can I listen to your
necklace?

672
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,430
No, you can't. Will you
Just sit still...

673
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,390
Why is there a skeleton?
over there?

674
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,550
I don't know, Walter,
Could you please...?

675
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,670
If I squint it looks like a
pirate flag.

676
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,670
Could you please have him?
Sit still?

677
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,110
Does he have a name? No,
He hasn't got a name.

678
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,030
I'm sorry, Ben, I am sorry.

679
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,030
I have a lot of patients
waiting.

680
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,590
Would you please it still?
Please.

681
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,070
He got mad at me. Yes, he did.
He did.

682
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,270
The sooner you sit still,
The sooner we can

683
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:39,950
Get this mess over with.

684
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,390
Okay. Then can we eat sugar
plums?

685
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,750
You betch a... we'll eat sugar
Plums,

686
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:45,590
Have gingerbread houses,
And we'll even paint eggs.

687
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,910
Well, paint eggs, that's Easter.

688
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:51,790
Ow! Ohh...

689
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,790
My finger has a heartbeat.

690
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:56,510
It won't hurt so much after
a little.

691
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,230
What's your name?

692
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,830
Buddy.

693
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,390
I'm Carolyn.

694
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,790
Hi.

695
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,870
What do you want for Christmas?

696
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:05,910
A Suzy-talks-a-lot.

697
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:08,550
I'll put in a good word with
the big man.

698
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,390
Thanks. Your costume is pretty.

699
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:13,590
Oh, it's not a costume.
I'm an elf.

700
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,430
Well, technically, I'm a human,

701
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,830
But I was raised by elves.

702
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:20,110
Oh, I'm a human raised by humans.

703
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,670
Hmm. Cool.

704
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:29,710
So?

705
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:34,270
It's a boy... buddy's your son.

706
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,830
That's very impossible.

707
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,430
You... you saw that guy out there.

708
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,870
He's... he's certifiably insane.

709
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,230
He's probably just reverting

710
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,750
To a state of childlike
dependency.

711
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:43,670
An elf?

712
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,670
What he needs is to be nurtured.

713
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,590
Oh, I see.

714
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,470
So, um, uh...

715
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,110
You'd like me to breastfeed him?

716
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,710
Walter, just bring him home.

717
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,870
Introduce him to Emily and
Michael,

718
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,990
And once... once he comes to
Terms with reality,

719
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:59,030
He should drop the whole elf
Thing and move on with his life.

720
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:01,430
I mean, that's what I would do if
I was you.

721
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:04,870
Oh, my god! Walter, this is...

722
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,110
This is wonderful,

723
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,950
You... you have another son.

724
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,670
Wonderful. Oh, gosh, I...

725
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:12,390
I guess I never really thought
of it that way.

726
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,750
This is incredible, I...

727
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:15,950
You know, it's a little
complicated,

728
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:18,110
But it's nothing that we can't
handle.

729
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:20,510
Honey? What?

730
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:23,390
He thinks he's an elf.

731
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:24,470
I'm sorry, what?

732
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:27,070
He think she's a Christmas elf.

733
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:27,710
Oh, come on, Walter,

734
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:31,790
I'm sure he doesn't actually
think he's an elf.

735
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:35,070
And then, I traveled through
the seven levels

736
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,510
Of the candy cane forest,

737
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:40,510
Past the sea of swirly-twirly
gumdrops,

738
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:45,950
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel.

739
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,390
Ahh.

740
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:09,310
So, where were you for the
last 30 years?

741
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,190
The north pole.

742
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,790
Can you pass the maple syrup?
Please?

743
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:16,510
I... I didn't put... it's
spaghetti.

744
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:20,190
Oh, you know what? I think
I have some.

745
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,590
Yes.

746
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:24,150
You like sugar, huh?

747
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,870
Is there sugar in syrup?

748
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:26,990
Yes.

749
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,190
Then yes.

750
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,630
We elves try to stick to the
four main food groups

751
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:36,510
Candy, candy canes, candy corns,
and syrup.

752
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:40,030
So, will you be staying with us?
Then?

753
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,150
You mean I can stay?

754
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:42,590
Of course you can. Emily.

755
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:45,030
How... how long do you think
you'll be with us?

756
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:47,430
I... I hadn't really planned
it out,

757
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:49,790
But I was thinking, like...
forever.

758
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:52,430
Emily? Can I just speak to you
for a minute

759
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:55,110
in the, uh, kitchen, please?

760
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,750
Are you crazy? He cannot
stay here.

761
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:01,790
Clearly he has some serious issues.

762
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,950
We can't just throw him out in
the snow.

763
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:05,750
Why not? He loves the snow.

764
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:07,710
He's told me 15 times.

765
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,630
Walter, he's your son.

766
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:24,550
Did you hear that?

767
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:28,430
You are so weird.

768
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:31,630
Dad?

769
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:36,190
Dad?

770
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:39,310
Dad!

771
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,030
What?

772
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:46,070
What?

773
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:51,950
I am not gonna tuck you in.

774
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:55,270
I... I promise I'll go right
to sleep.

775
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:58,750
Fine.

776
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,990
Tickle fight, tickle fight!
buddy, stop.

777
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:10,030
Tickle fight. Tickle... stop
stop, stop.

778
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,550
Sorry.

779
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:13,510
It's all right.

780
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,430
Hey, uh...

781
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:17,390
You just lay there and go to
sleep.

782
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:18,630
Okay.

783
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:19,870
Okay.

784
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:23,510
Dad? Hmm?

785
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:26,310
I love you.

786
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:32,150
Okay. Go to sleep now.

787
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:37,630
Well, this is really something.

788
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:41,830
I'm usually the one making
breakfast.

789
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:45,670
That's good, that's good.

790
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:48,550
Okay.

791
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:57,030
Oh, that's good.

792
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,670
Good? Good.

793
00:44:58,710 --> 00:44:59,950
Good.

794
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:02,790
So, did you, um...

795
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:04,350
Did you sleep okay last night?

796
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:05,870
Great. I got a full 40 minutes.

797
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:09,070
And I had time to build that
rocking horse.

798
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:13,070
Uh, oh, my gosh. You actually
made that?

799
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,790
Where did you get all the wood?

800
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:27,870
Good morning, honey. Good
morning, dad.

801
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:30,670
Walter, buddy has made us
breakfast.

802
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,550
Isn't that nice?

803
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:34,270
And lunch.

804
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:35,670
And lunch.

805
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:36,950
Bye.

806
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:37,870
So, dad, how many scoops?

807
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:40,750
I'll stick with the coffee now,
thanks.

808
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:43,670
So, dad...

809
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,310
I planned out our whole day.

810
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:46,470
First, we'll make snow angels
for two hours,

811
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,030
And then we'll go ice skating
and then we'll eat a
whole roll

812
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:51,030
Of tollhouse cookie dough as fast
as we can,

813
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:53,230
And then, to finish, we'll snuggle.

814
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:55,830
I've got to go to work, buddy.

815
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:56,990
Oh, and another thing...

816
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:58,750
If you're going to be staying
here,

817
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:00,470
You should think about, you know,

818
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:02,070
Getting rid of the costume.

819
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:03,390
But I've worn this my whole life.

820
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:06,430
You're not in the North Pole any
longer.

821
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:08,630
You wanna make me happy, don't you?

822
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:09,230
More than anything.

823
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:13,910
Then, lose the tights. I mean,
as soon as possible.

824
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:15,470
As soon as possible?

825
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:16,990
As soon as possible.

826
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:18,350
Okay.

827
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,230
I almost forgot...

828
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,030
Aah! Aah!

829
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:27,470
Good morning.

830
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:32,310
Walter here.

831
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:34,550
It worked, it's you.

832
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:36,470
How'd you get this number?

833
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:38,390
Emily left an emergency list.

834
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:38,950
I see.

835
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:40,550
And, uh, is this an emergency?

836
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:41,670
There's a horrible noise

837
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:44,590
Coming from the evil
box underneath the window.

838
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:45,830
It sounds like this...

839
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:52,070
It's, uh, it's... it's not evil,
buddy,

840
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:53,150
It's, uh, it's a radiator,

841
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:54,950
And the heat makes noise when
it comes on.

842
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:58,030
No, it doesn't. It... It's very
evil.

843
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:01,510
It's scary to look at. It's...
okay...

844
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:04,990
I'm going toward... oh, wait.
Yes, it is.

845
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,630
Okay, it's okay. It's okay.

846
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:07,510
Everything's fine.

847
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:08,310
You were right.

848
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:10,750
Okay, good, uh, I'm gonna hang
up now.

849
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:11,550
I love you.

850
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:13,190
I'll call you in five minutes.

851
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:14,790
No, no, buddy, don't, uh...

852
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:17,270
You... you don't have to call me,
okay?

853
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:18,750
Good idea, you call me.

854
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:20,510
Okay. I'm gonna hang up now.

855
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:22,310
I painted a picture of a
butterfly.

856
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:24,510
Good. I'm gonna hang up now.

857
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,670
I tuned the piano.

858
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,790
Okay, I love you. Bye.

859
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:30,710
Mmm...

860
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,270
Mmm... Mmm.

861
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:48,110
Mmm.

862
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:51,750
Hobbs. Hey!

863
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:53,390
How you doing? Please, sit
down.

864
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:55,630
I haven't seen you since
the retreat.

865
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:56,510
You're looking good.

866
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:57,910
Oh, thank you very much.
You as well.

867
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:59,230
To what do I owe the, uh,
pleasure?

868
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:02,550
Well, to be honest, I got a call
from my niece.

869
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:04,270
She wants to know

870
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:07,910
How a certain puppy and a
certain pigeon

871
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:11,510
Escape the clutches of a
certain evil witch.

872
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:13,470
Believe me, uh,

873
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:14,950
We're already looking for new
printers.

874
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:17,430
This one has obviously gotten a
little sloppy.

875
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:19,870
Maybe it isn't the printer who's
gotten sloppy.

876
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:21,990
That's your signature, right?

877
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:24,910
You know, we could sit here and
point fingers all day.

878
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:26,350
I've got news for you...

879
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:28,830
Even if those two pages were
in there,

880
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:30,190
The book still would have sucked.

881
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:32,430
Have you seen the numbers for
this quarter?

882
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:34,590
Uh, they'll be here today. Oh,
they're in.

883
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:36,430
That frigging puppy and pigeon

884
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:37,630
Are tanking hard, Hobbs.

885
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:39,550
My people estimate we're
gonna post

886
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,230
A minus eight for this quarter.

887
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:44,350
A minus eight! That does not
happen!

888
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:46,750
You know, we'll... we'll bounce
back, we...

889
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,430
No, no, no. No? Well...

890
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:50,110
We're gonna ship a new book

891
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:51,470
The first quarter.

892
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:52,750
First quarter?

893
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:55,310
I'm gonna be back in town on
the 24th.

894
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:57,790
At that time, I would love
to hear

895
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:59,510
In exact detail

896
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:02,590
What your plans are for this
new book.

897
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:06,350
Uh, wait a minute, the, uh
the 24th, that's Christmas
eve.

898
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:09,030
And?

899
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:10,910
And, uh...

900
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:13,870
No problem. Be great to have
you in the loop.

901
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,750
All right, I got every
weapon in the game.

902
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,150
I got full health, I got full
armor.

903
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:22,950
Michael!

904
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:24,070
I got full...

905
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:25,190
Michael!

906
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:27,110
It's me buddy!

907
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:28,510
You know that guy?

908
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:31,390
No, I've never seen him before.

909
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:34,230
It's me buddy! Your brother!

910
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:35,550
Oh, man.

911
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:39,990
No, Michael! Wait! It's your
brother bud...

912
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:43,390
Sorry. Sorry! Horn honks

913
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:46,630
Michael! Michael!

914
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:48,390
Michael!

915
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:50,630
Michael, wait up!

916
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:52,190
Michael! Michael!

917
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:53,670
Wow, you're fast.

918
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:55,470
I'm gladi caught up with you.

919
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:56,990
I waited five hours for you.

920
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:58,470
Why is your coat so big?

921
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:00,910
So, good news... I saw a dog
today.

922
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:03,270
Have you seen a dog?
You probably have.

923
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:04,910
How was school? Was it fun?

924
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:06,790
Did you get a lot of
homework, huh?

925
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:07,990
Do you have any friends?

926
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:09,430
Do you have a best friend?

927
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:10,790
Does he have a big coat, too?

928
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:12,230
Go away!

929
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:17,470
Ow! Son of a nutcracker!

930
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:21,590
Run!

931
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:25,350
Get him! Get the
green guy!

932
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,710
Oh, no. These guys are bad news.

933
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:37,190
We better get outta here.

934
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:40,870
You know what? We can take 'em.

935
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:44,710
Okay, just start making as
many snowballs as you can.

936
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:53,830
You ready?

937
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:57,430
Let's go. Aah! Ow.

938
00:50:58,590 --> 00:50:59,910
Ow!

939
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:06,350
Run!

940
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:16,750
Oh, man. One got away.

941
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:17,990
Snowball.

942
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:27,590
Unh!

943
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:29,710
Wow.

944
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:33,070
Where did you say you were from?

945
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:35,190
Oh, yeah

946
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:37,830
Candles burning low

947
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:40,390
Lots of mistletoe

948
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:45,990
Lots of snow and ice everywhere
we go

949
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:51,310
Choirs singing carols right
outside my door

950
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:53,230
All these things and more

951
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:55,150
I wish dad were here.

952
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:55,390
Why?

953
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:59,190
'Cause he's the greatest dad in
the whole wide world.

954
00:51:59,230 --> 00:51:59,990
Are you kidding?

955
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:02,510
He's the worst dad in the world.

956
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:04,230
What do you mean?

957
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:05,910
All he does is work.

958
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:07,270
Working's fun.

959
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:09,230
Not the way he does it.

960
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:10,190
All he cares about is money.

961
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:14,190
He doesn't care about you,
or me, or anybody.

962
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:16,910
Well, he is on the naughty list.

963
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:23,150
You like her?

964
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:24,910
Like who?

965
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:26,870
The girl you're staring at.

966
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:28,550
Oh, uh...

967
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:30,230
Yeah.

968
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:33,550
Why don't you ask her out?

969
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:34,470
Out?

970
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:37,470
You know, on a date...
to eat food.

971
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:38,310
Food?

972
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:40,950
Yes, real food, not candy.

973
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:43,550
And if she says yes,
you're in.

974
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:46,070
It's like a secret code
girls have.

975
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:49,550
Well, look who it is.

976
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:52,550
Hi, Jovie. Hi.

977
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:56,150
Oh, uh, this is Michael.

978
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:57,710
I'm his brother.

979
00:52:58,630 --> 00:52:59,590
Hi.

980
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:01,350
So, what are you doing here?

981
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:03,870
Did gimbel's give you your
job back?

982
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:06,350
No. But things worked out
pretty good.

983
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:08,310
They gave mea restraining
order.

984
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:12,230
Well, um, you should probably
get outta here.

985
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:15,030
Ho ho ho!

986
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:17,190
But... I really wanted to
see you,

987
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:21,110
And... and I think you're
beautiful, and I, um...

988
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:24,470
I feel really warm when I
am around you,

989
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:28,590
And, um, my tongue swells up.

990
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:34,550
So...

991
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:36,910
Do you wanna go eat food?

992
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:39,790
Do I... do I wanna eat food?

993
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:40,710
Mm-hmm.

994
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:45,830
You know, uh, the code... food.

995
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:50,510
Well, I just had my lunch
break.

996
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:53,550
Oh, okay. I understand.

997
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:56,270
But I'm free on Thursday.

998
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:58,590
Thursday! Thursday!

999
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:00,710
Come on. That'd be great.

1000
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:01,630
All right.

1001
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:03,350
Was that okay?

1002
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:05,910
You did great, man.

1003
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:07,710
What should we put on it
first?

1004
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:09,030
Lights! Oh, good.

1005
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:10,270
And then, after that?

1006
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:13,070
Ornaments! Ornaments, okay.

1007
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,430
What the hell's that?

1008
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:16,670
A Christmas tree.

1009
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:17,870
A Christmas tree?

1010
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:20,910
Buddy chopped it down in
the park.

1011
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:23,030
Emily.

1012
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:25,550
I don't know what you're making
such a big deal about.

1013
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:27,510
They were just having a
little fun.

1014
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:29,390
Oh, fun? So felonies are
fun now?

1015
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:32,110
I thought, see, felonies
were felonies.

1016
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:33,030
Okay, the tree thing was bad.

1017
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:34,270
I'll get him to plant
another one.

1018
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:36,830
But at least Michael is
happy for once.

1019
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:39,270
What, uh, what's that supposed
to mean?

1020
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:41,510
Well, I don't think it's any
secret, Walter,

1021
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:43,710
That you haven't exactly been
there for him.

1022
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:45,630
I'll tell you what, why don't
we just

1023
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:47,470
Pull him outta school and let
the, uh,

1024
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:48,710
Deranged elf man raise him?

1025
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:51,470
Then they can have lots of
fun committing felonies.

1026
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:54,430
How are we gonna get the star
on top?

1027
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:55,910
I got it.

1028
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:08,390
I mean, what are we gonna do?

1029
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,510
We can't... we can't leave him
alone here.

1030
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:12,950
He's gonna destroy the place.

1031
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:15,550
Why don't you, um...

1032
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:16,830
Why don't you take off tomorrow?

1033
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:18,990
You know, and you could stay
home and watch him?

1034
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:21,230
Oh, no. No, I can't stay home
tomorrow,

1035
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:22,550
I have a budget meeting tomorrow.

1036
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:24,350
Well, honey, I can't take off,

1037
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:25,790
I'm one... one bad pitch away

1038
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:27,110
From getting fired... one.

1039
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:29,950
Well, I tell you what, I have
an idea then.

1040
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:32,750
Why don't you take buddy to
work with you?

1041
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:41,870
Hey, Walter. Morning, jack.

1042
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:43,470
Morning, jack.

1043
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:44,990
Oh, good morning, Mr. Hobbs.

1044
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:46,470
Good morning, Sarah. Good
morning, Sarah.

1045
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:49,430
That's a nice purple dress.
It's very purple-y

1046
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:50,830
Francisco. How's it going, Mr.
Hobbs?

1047
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:54,790
Francisco, that's fun to say..."
Francisco."

1048
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:57,150
Hi! Hi.

1049
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:58,030
Do you remember me?

1050
00:55:58,070 --> 00:55:59,910
I do. I didn't recognize you.

1051
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:01,750
I know, I'm in work clothes.

1052
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:07,030
Thank you, Deborah.

1053
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:08,030
Thanks, deb.

1054
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:09,350
Deb, you have such a pretty face.

1055
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:10,670
You should be on a Christmas card.

1056
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:13,030
You just made my day.

1057
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:21,990
Eww.

1058
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:25,750
Buddy. Hmm?

1059
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:27,670
You don't have to drink that.

1060
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:29,150
Thank you.

1061
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:40,750
Francisco.

1062
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:44,270
Francisco.

1063
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:47,230
Francisco.

1064
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:48,830
Francisco.

1065
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:50,350
Buddy?

1066
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:53,870
Just... just a little.

1067
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:01,830
Yes, bud?

1068
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:04,390
Why is your name on the desk?

1069
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:06,470
I bought the desk.

1070
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:09,190
My name's there so no one
steals it.

1071
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:12,710
That's a joke, isn't it, dad?

1072
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:15,230
Yeah, buddy, that's a joke.

1073
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:17,710
So, what are we gonna build?

1074
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:18,990
No, uh, we don't do

1075
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:20,710
That kind of work here, pal.

1076
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:24,070
Buddy the elf, what's your
favorite color?

1077
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:25,390
Put that down. Hello?

1078
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:27,670
Hello? Dial tone

1079
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:31,310
Please, don't touch anything.

1080
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:32,710
Sorry.

1081
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:37,350
Hey...

1082
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:41,030
Bud, have you... have you...

1083
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:43,030
Have you ever seen a mailroom?

1084
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:44,230
A mailroom? No.

1085
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:45,390
No? No.

1086
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:46,190
Oh, I mean, wow.

1087
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:48,830
Wow... listen, it's a
place where mail

1088
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:49,790
From all over the world
comes,

1089
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:52,430
Uh-huh. And they sort it
out there, see?

1090
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:53,350
And you can touch it all,

1091
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,150
And they put it in these
shiny bins.

1092
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:56,590
Shiny bins? Right.

1093
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:58,990
What do ya think? It
sounds great.

1094
00:57:59,030 --> 00:57:59,990
Good.

1095
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:01,470
Can we go there?

1096
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:02,190
Well, um...

1097
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:05,310
I gotta work here, maybe... maybe
you can work there.

1098
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:06,550
Okay, I'll work there.

1099
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:11,110
Oh, I don't think this is
the place

1100
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:12,310
My dad was talking about.

1101
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:13,790
Is there a different mailroom?

1102
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:15,950
No. This is the only one.

1103
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:18,070
It's not very shiny.

1104
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:22,030
Now... over here's the trench.

1105
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:24,070
All the mail comes out that
shooter.

1106
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:28,310
Scan and find the floor each
piece is moving to.

1107
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:29,230
Put it in a canister

1108
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:32,750
And shove it up the tube with
the same number.

1109
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:34,110
You got that?

1110
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:35,470
I think so.

1111
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:38,350
This place reminds me of
Santa's workshop.

1112
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:39,790
Except it smells like mushrooms,

1113
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:42,750
And everyone looks like they
wanna hurt me.

1114
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:44,950
Uh, greenway's coming in tomorrow,

1115
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:46,470
So, what... what do we got?

1116
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:48,470
Well, Morris and I have been
brainstorming,

1117
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:50,830
And we've come up with what I
think

1118
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:52,190
Is a pretty big idea.

1119
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:52,670
Great, what?

1120
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:55,150
You're gonna love it, it's
fantastic.

1121
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:56,070
What?

1122
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:59,270
Okay, picture this...

1123
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:02,430
We bring in miles finch.

1124
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:04,830
The miles finch?

1125
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:06,030
The golden ghost.

1126
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:07,150
We bring him in!

1127
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:09,910
He's written more classics than dr.
Seuss.

1128
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:10,870
I tain't gonna be easy,

1129
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:12,470
But I think it's worth a shot.

1130
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:16,950
My two top writers, my crack team,
my fun squad...

1131
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:18,550
You came in here pitching me

1132
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:20,990
The idea of hiring another writer?

1133
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:22,030
Yeah.

1134
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:24,110
Miles finch.

1135
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:29,150
I like it. Chuckles

1136
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:31,190
I like it.

1137
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:33,190
Then I traveled through the seven
levels

1138
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:34,110
Of the candy cane forest

1139
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:38,230
And past the sea of swirly-twirly
gumdrops.

1140
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:40,630
Ooh!

1141
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:43,550
Wow... it's sucky.

1142
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:45,950
Ohh, it's wonderful. Yes!

1143
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:48,310
That is marvelous how that...

1144
00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:49,990
Oh!

1145
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:52,430
Oh, it's very sucky.

1146
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:54,870
It's very... sucky.

1147
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:56,110
Whoo.

1148
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:57,910
So, how'd you get here?

1149
00:59:57,950 --> 00:59:59,350
Work release.

1150
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:00,390
Mm.

1151
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,870
Oh, syrup and coffee?

1152
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:06,070
Why didn't I think of that? Can I
try some?

1153
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:07,150
Be my guest.

1154
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:08,590
Very generous of you.

1155
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:12,830
Mmm. I love syrup.

1156
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:16,870
Ohh, I love it.

1157
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:19,950
Mmm...

1158
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:22,670
You know, I know I sound like a
broken record,

1159
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:23,590
But we are buddies.

1160
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:25,790
You're my best friend, that's it.

1161
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:26,470
You're my best friend.

1162
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:29,110
You know, buddy, nobody around
here listens to me.

1163
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:31,190
I got really good ideas. Yeah?
I believe it.

1164
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:33,150
I know, I'm right, I listen to you.

1165
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:34,030
You have great ideas.

1166
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:35,870
I just try to go with the flow,
you know?

1167
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:36,990
Good, you go with the flow.

1168
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:38,030
Yeah. Go with the flow.

1169
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:39,390
No, I gotta get out of the flow.

1170
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:40,670
Well, then get out of the flow.

1171
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:41,830
I'm in the flow, that's what got
me here.

1172
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:45,150
I gotta... I'm 26 years old, I got
nothing to show for it.

1173
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:47,070
You're young. You're so young.

1174
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:48,790
My papa... yeah?

1175
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:53,270
He didn't make master tinker till
he was 490,so...

1176
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:57,670
Four-hundred and ninety? Yeah.

1177
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:01,510
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!

1178
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:03,870
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!

1179
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:07,270
My favorite book of yours has
gotta be Gus' pickles.

1180
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:10,350
It's existential, yet it's so
accessible.

1181
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:13,190
Uh, Mr. Finch, uh, Eugene Dupris
here.

1182
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:15,950
It's a thrill just to be talking
to you

1183
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:17,110
On our speakerphone.

1184
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:19,070
Miles, um, so, what do you think?

1185
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:19,990
Can you fly in tomorrow?

1186
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:22,190
I'll give you five hours tomorrow,

1187
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:23,350
Not a minute more.

1188
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:24,350
Oh, that's... that's great.

1189
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:27,870
I'd like a black s500to receive
me at the airport.

1190
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:29,630
I need the interior of that car

1191
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:31,550
To be 71 degrees exactly.

1192
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:33,230
We can do that.
Mr. Hobbs?

1193
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:34,910
There's a situation downstairs.

1194
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:36,030
I'm sorry, what?

1195
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:37,230
No, hold on, miles. Deb, hang up.

1196
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:39,310
I do not hold. Do not put
me on hold.

1197
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:41,830
We have a problem in the
mailroom.

1198
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:42,670
What's going on?

1199
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:44,630
Don't speak... Deborah, hang up!

1200
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:46,550
That's it, I'm gone. Miles!

1201
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:51,790
I'll be there tomorrow... 71
degrees.

1202
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:54,270
Sir, chuck in the mailroom

1203
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:55,710
Needs to talk to you.

1204
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,070
Chuck... what, chuck?

1205
01:01:57,110 --> 01:01:58,550
I mean, what could be going on
down there

1206
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:00,550
That's so important you had to
interrupt me, what?

1207
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,390
Whoomp, there it is! A little
louder

1208
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:04,230
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

1209
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:06,030
Whoomp! There it is

1210
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:07,430
Upside down and inside out hey!

1211
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:08,750
I'm 'bout to show all you folks

1212
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:10,110
What it's all about hey!

1213
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:11,310
Time for me to get on the mike

1214
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:12,870
And make this mother of a party
hype

1215
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:14,430
I'm taking you back to the old
school

1216
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:15,950
'cause I'm an old fool who's so cool

1217
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:17,710
If you wanna get down, I'm gonna
show you the way

1218
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:19,750
Whoomp, there it is, let me hear
you say

1219
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:21,830
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

1220
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:23,830
Whoomp! There it is a little louder

1221
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:25,790
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

1222
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:27,390
Whoomp, there it is!

1223
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:30,150
Coming.

1224
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:36,950
Hi.

1225
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:38,270
Wow.

1226
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:39,950
You look miraculous.

1227
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:41,270
So do you.

1228
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:42,510
Thank you.

1229
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,470
What would you like to do?

1230
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:46,470
I got some ideas.

1231
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:54,150
Just reach out in front of you and
and take a sip.

1232
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:57,470
Don't look. There you go.

1233
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:00,950
Well?

1234
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:03,910
It tastes like a crappy cup
of coffee.

1235
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:06,070
No.

1236
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:09,190
It is a crappy cup of coffee.

1237
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:11,590
No, it's the world's best cup
of coffee.

1238
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:15,230
The trick is to not get your arm caught
in the door!

1239
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:18,590
Also, never close your eyes' cause
then

1240
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:22,150
Okay, when you feel comfortable, you
just jump in!

1241
01:03:22,190 --> 01:03:23,790
what are you doing?

1242
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:26,750
I'm skipping. I'm skipping.
I'm skipping.

1243
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:29,670
Wait, wait, wait... one more, one more.

1244
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:32,270
Now, look at the size of this one.

1245
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:39,350
Come with me.

1246
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,190
Watch out.

1247
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:43,190
Yellow ones don't stop.

1248
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:45,150
The yellow ones don't stop.

1249
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:54,350
Wow... that's a big one.

1250
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:15,550
I'm sorry.

1251
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:16,830
You missed.

1252
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:18,710
What do you mean I missed?

1253
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:20,190
You missed.

1254
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:40,750
Miles finch.

1255
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:42,270
Miles finch.

1256
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:45,950
Miles finch.

1257
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:49,710
All right, let's do this.

1258
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:51,990
Miles, I'm so happy you could come
Uh...

1259
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:52,350
Yeah.

1260
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:54,910
I'm Walter Hobbs. Yeah, let's get
the, uh...

1261
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:57,430
Taken care of so we can get started
here.

1262
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:59,110
Here you go.

1263
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:01,910
Great.

1264
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:04,350
All right... clears throat

1265
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:06,710
What have you guys got so far?

1266
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:07,990
Go ahead.

1267
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:09,230
Uh...

1268
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:12,350
We were thinking, uh, something
like this, uh...

1269
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:14,230
We open on a young tomato.

1270
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:16,310
He's had some tough times down
at the farm

1271
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:18,110
With, you know, a rabbit, and...

1272
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:19,630
No. No tomatoes...

1273
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:21,070
Too vulnerable.

1274
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:22,630
Kids, they're already vulnerable.

1275
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:24,270
No, you see? I... I told you guys.

1276
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:25,910
I told them the very same thing...

1277
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:26,510
And no farms.

1278
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:28,870
Every body's pushing small town
rural.

1279
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:31,190
A farm book would just be white
noise.

1280
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:31,990
What about this?

1281
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:34,870
Uh, a tribe of asparagus children,

1282
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:39,350
But they're self-conscious about
the way their pee smells.

1283
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:46,110
Apparently, all we have is
vegetables.

1284
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:47,350
I have no time, so, you know,

1285
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:48,510
If you've got a story here...

1286
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:51,230
I've got about five or six great
starts here.

1287
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:53,230
I've got one idea that
I'm especially

1288
01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:55,350
Psyched out of my mind about.

1289
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:57,150
You know, it's one of those ideas

1290
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:58,950
Where you're just like, uh...

1291
01:05:58,990 --> 01:05:59,830
Yes!

1292
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:01,950
Whoa!

1293
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:04,270
Uh, great, c-could we hear it?

1294
01:06:04,310 --> 01:06:07,510
I'll start with the cover.
Picture this... you got, uh

1295
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:10,190
Dad! I'm in love, I'm in love,

1296
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:12,790
And I don't care who knows it!

1297
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:13,470
Buddy, not now, uh,

1298
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:15,710
Can you please go back to the...
to the pit?

1299
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:17,910
I'll come and visit you in a
little while, okay?

1300
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:21,230
I didn't know you had elves
working here.

1301
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:25,950
Oh... boy, you're... you're hilarious,
my friend.

1302
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:28,150
He doesn't, uh... get back to

1303
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,710
The story, please. All right, okay.

1304
01:06:31,830 --> 01:06:33,230
So, on the cover above the title...

1305
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:35,510
Does Santa know that you left the
workshop?

1306
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:37,750
You know, we're all laughing our
heads off.

1307
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:39,830
Did you have to borrow a reindeer
to get down here?

1308
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:41,590
Buddy... go back to the basement.

1309
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:43,070
Hey, jack weed,

1310
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:44,630
I get more action in a week

1311
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:45,950
Than you've had your entire life.

1312
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:49,470
I've got houses in I.e., Paris,
and Vail,

1313
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:50,790
Oh. Each one of them

1314
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:52,750
with a 70-inchplasma screen.

1315
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:54,150
So, I suggest you wipe

1316
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:55,510
That stupid smile off your face

1317
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:57,990
Before I come over there and smack
it off!

1318
01:06:58,030 --> 01:06:59,590
You feeling strong, my friend?!

1319
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:02,870
Call me elf one more time!

1320
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:09,430
He's an angry elf.

1321
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:14,830
Look at you.

1322
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:18,590
Ow! Hey, what...

1323
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:19,310
Aah!

1324
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:20,990
I wasn't ready for that.

1325
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:23,150
Aah! Hey, hey, hey!

1326
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:25,310
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa!

1327
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:25,790
Ooh...

1328
01:07:25,790 --> 01:07:27,710
Call me elf one more time!

1329
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,390
Call me elf!

1330
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:31,070
You're an elf.

1331
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:39,750
Miles, I'm sorry, he... he thinks
he's an elf.

1332
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:41,430
Listen, miles...

1333
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:43,870
Listen, miles! Door slams

1334
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:46,230
He must be a South Pole elf.

1335
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:50,110
You get the hell outta here.

1336
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:51,390
Where do you want me to go?

1337
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:52,630
I don't care where you go.

1338
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:53,870
I don't care that you're an elf!

1339
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:55,550
I don't care that you're nuts!

1340
01:07:55,590 --> 01:07:57,230
I don't care that you're my son!

1341
01:07:57,270 --> 01:08:00,030
Get out of my life now!

1342
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:11,030
Hi, it's me.

1343
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:12,510
I really can't talk right now.

1344
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:14,750
Well, just tell me how the pitch
went.

1345
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:17,430
I'm gonna be a little later than
I thought, okay?

1346
01:08:17,470 --> 01:08:19,590
Well, don't be too late, Walter,

1347
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:21,270
It's Christmas Eve.

1348
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:22,910
Walter... wait, um.

1349
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:24,990
Honey, I gotta go, okay? Love ya.

1350
01:08:25,030 --> 01:08:27,070
Oh, say hi to buddy.

1351
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:29,430
What? Walter, breakthrough.

1352
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:31,590
We found this in the conference
room.

1353
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:32,030
What is it?

1354
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:33,910
It's miles finch's notebook.

1355
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:36,990
This thing is chock full of
genius ideas.

1356
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:37,590
I mean, look at that.

1357
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:41,350
And his best idea is about a
peach that lives on a farm.

1358
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:43,550
What's more vulnerable than a
peach?

1359
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:44,150
What, uh, what do we do?

1360
01:08:44,190 --> 01:08:47,390
I think we should go with the
first pitch... it's genius.

1361
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:47,990
Uh, how much time we got?

1362
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:49,830
We got, like, 45 minutes. Well,
come on, let's, uh,

1363
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:51,750
Try to get a storyboard or
something ready.

1364
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:52,910
Come on, let's do it. Just try.

1365
01:08:52,950 --> 01:08:55,350
No, you can't sit down and get a
storyboard ready.

1366
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:56,830
Go and get a storyboard ready.

1367
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:58,990
Oh, boy! Go.

1368
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:04,910
"I'm sorry I ruined your lives

1369
01:09:04,950 --> 01:09:09,670
"And crammed 11 cookies into
the vcr.

1370
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:14,870
"I don't belong here. I don't
belong anywhere.

1371
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:20,590
I'll never forget you. Love,
buddy."

1372
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:21,990
God...

1373
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:34,110
Hey, buddy.

1374
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,030
Buddy?

1375
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:45,670
As you know, we need a big
launch fast

1376
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:46,950
To get the company back on
track.

1377
01:09:46,990 --> 01:09:50,110
So, I think I speak for my fellow
board members

1378
01:09:50,150 --> 01:09:53,150
When I say... this better be good.

1379
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:55,630
Before I get into the story, uh,

1380
01:09:55,670 --> 01:09:58,070
Let me start with the cover, okay?

1381
01:09:58,110 --> 01:10:00,270
Now, just picture this...

1382
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:02,150
Dad! I gotta talk to you.

1383
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:03,990
Michael, what is it?

1384
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:05,190
Buddy ran away.

1385
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:07,510
What? He... he left a note.

1386
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:09,750
I'm scared, dad, he's gone.

1387
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:12,150
Uh, let me just finish this
meeting,

1388
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:14,470
And then, um, we'll figure it
out, okay?

1389
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:18,750
Figure out what? Buddy cares
about everybody.

1390
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:20,830
All you care about is yourself.

1391
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:24,870
Hey, Michael.

1392
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:26,950
Wait.

1393
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:33,470
We're gonna have to reschedule
this, uh, Mr. Greenway.

1394
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:34,830
We don't have time to reschedule.

1395
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:36,150
I wanna hear the damn thing now.

1396
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:37,270
Son, you'll have to wait.

1397
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:41,190
No, d-don't tell my kid what
to do, uh...

1398
01:10:41,710 --> 01:10:44,550
Can't... can't we do this another
time, Mr. Greenway?

1399
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:47,230
I flew in just to hear this pitch,

1400
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:48,470
And I intend to.

1401
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:49,910
It's gonna have to wait.

1402
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:51,870
If you wanna keep your job, Hobbs,

1403
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:54,750
You will pitch me this book
right now.

1404
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:04,390
Well... up yours.

1405
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:07,310
Yeah, up yours. Hey.

1406
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:10,110
Hobbs... Hobbs!

1407
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:11,830
Hobbs, you walk out of here,

1408
01:11:11,870 --> 01:11:14,310
And... and you're finished at
greenway!

1409
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:15,790
You're finished!

1410
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:35,190
I don't belong anywhere.

1411
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:39,270
Buddy!

1412
01:11:39,310 --> 01:11:41,150
Buddy!

1413
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:43,270
Buddy, where are you?!

1414
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:54,670
Prancer, pull! Come on! Come on!

1415
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:58,070
Vixen, up, up!

1416
01:11:58,110 --> 01:12:00,110
Santa?

1417
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:03,390
Come on, you can do it.

1418
01:12:03,430 --> 01:12:06,870
Pull up! Pull up!

1419
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:16,390
Dad! What?

1420
01:12:16,430 --> 01:12:17,870
Michael, where you going?

1421
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:19,190
Michael!

1422
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:36,910
Santa.

1423
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:41,430
Back off, slick. You'll scare
the deer.

1424
01:12:41,470 --> 01:12:44,110
Buddy, is that you?

1425
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:44,990
Are you okay?

1426
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:47,510
Boy, am I glad to see you.

1427
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:51,270
The Claus meter suddenly just
dropped down to zero.

1428
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:54,750
There's just no Christmas
spirit anymore.

1429
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:57,670
And then the strain was too
Much...

1430
01:12:57,670 --> 01:13:00,510
The engine broke free of her
mounts.

1431
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:07,710
I need an elf's help.

1432
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:10,150
I... I'm not an elf, Santa.

1433
01:13:10,190 --> 01:13:12,510
I... I can't do anything right.

1434
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:17,190
Buddy, you're more of an elf than
anyone I ever met,

1435
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:19,510
And the only one who I would want

1436
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:21,790
Working on my sleigh tonight.

1437
01:13:21,790 --> 01:13:23,630
Really? Really.

1438
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:26,190
Will you fix it for me, buddy?

1439
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:28,670
I'll try. Papa taught me how.

1440
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:29,430
You gotta find it first.

1441
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:32,190
It dropped off the sleigh back
over there a ways.

1442
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:34,990
The engine? The engine, yeah.

1443
01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:37,950
Go, buddy. Go, Mr. Elf!

1444
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:40,870
I'm standing here outside
central park

1445
01:13:40,910 --> 01:13:44,310
Where it is unclear exactly
what has happened.

1446
01:13:44,350 --> 01:13:46,110
What we do know is that
authorities

1447
01:13:46,150 --> 01:13:46,910
Have closed the park

1448
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:48,150
And are in the process of
clearing it.

1449
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:50,790
The only thing that people can
seem to agree on here

1450
01:13:50,830 --> 01:13:54,150
Is that they saw something fall
from the sky.

1451
01:13:54,190 --> 01:13:55,350
I've got an eyewitness with me

1452
01:13:55,390 --> 01:13:57,470
Who claims to have seen the whole
thing firsthand.

1453
01:13:57,510 --> 01:13:58,630
What did you actually see?

1454
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:01,110
You know, I was walking around and
I saw this thing,

1455
01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:03,270
And my daughter actually pointed
it out to me.

1456
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:04,310
Oh, your daughter saw it?

1457
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:05,270
Sweetheart, can you tell me

1458
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:07,550
What you saw falling out of the
sky?

1459
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:09,190
It was Santa's sleigh!

1460
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:12,550
Santa's sleigh, well, there you
have it.

1461
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:13,350
Santa's in Manhattan.

1462
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:16,430
Sorry to interrupt your first big
news story, charlotte,

1463
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:18,510
But New York one has just received

1464
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:20,550
Some exclusive amateur news footage

1465
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:22,550
That you just might Anna follow
up on.

1466
01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:25,830
There seems to be a strange man
dressed as an elf

1467
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:27,230
Wandering through central park.

1468
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:30,150
Now, I don't know if this is the
kind of hard-hitting news

1469
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:32,110
You're used to covering in buffalo,
charlotte,

1470
01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:33,630
Oh, my god. But here at New York one,

1471
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:36,030
News is top priority.

1472
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:48,510
What the heck...?

1473
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:50,350
Hey!

1474
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:53,350
You found it. Buddy!

1475
01:14:58,590 --> 01:14:59,990
I need to tell you something.

1476
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:01,030
No, no. Buddy, there's something

1477
01:15:01,070 --> 01:15:02,030
I have to tell you right now.

1478
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:05,790
Um, I didn't mean anything I said back
there, not word.

1479
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:09,670
I know you may be a little, um, um...

1480
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:10,990
Uh, chemically imbalanced,

1481
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:13,670
But you've been right about a lot
of things.

1482
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:16,950
I... I don't want you to leave.

1483
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:20,190
You're my son, and I... love you.

1484
01:15:27,270 --> 01:15:27,990
Uh, buddy, uh...

1485
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:30,790
What was it you wanted to tell me?

1486
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:33,030
Oh, right. Come with me.

1487
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:34,750
Right. Come on.

1488
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:42,150
I'm herewith another eyewitness

1489
01:15:42,150 --> 01:15:44,390
Who has his own version of what
happened.

1490
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:45,470
Sir, what did you see?

1491
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:46,630
I think you're great, charlotte.

1492
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:48,390
Uh, I saw something fall from the
sky

1493
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:50,110
Right into the middle of central
park.

1494
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:52,390
I mean, you're a great news lady.

1495
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:53,150
Thank you.

1496
01:15:53,190 --> 01:15:54,150
Could you tell me a bit more?

1497
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:55,430
About what you saw fall from the
sky?

1498
01:15:55,470 --> 01:15:56,670
Yeah, yeah. Your eyes tell the
story,

1499
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:58,630
That's what I love about you.
You've got a great mouth.

1500
01:15:58,630 --> 01:16:00,950
The thing just dropped in the middle of
central park.

1501
01:16:00,990 --> 01:16:03,270
It was amazing, and everybody's, like,
going crazy.

1502
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:05,190
Dick, uh, according to authorities,

1503
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:06,310
The area has been cleared.

1504
01:16:06,350 --> 01:16:09,790
Only the central park rangers now
remain in the park.

1505
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:11,550
These forces are highly trained,

1506
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:12,870
But rarely see action.

1507
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:15,910
Some have accused them of being
too gung ho

1508
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:16,750
When called into duty,

1509
01:16:16,790 --> 01:16:19,430
And their controversial crowd
control tactics

1510
01:16:19,470 --> 01:16:22,030
At the Simon and Garfunkel concert
in '85

1511
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:24,270
Are still under investigation.

1512
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:26,470
I knew you'd find it, Mr. Elf!

1513
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:29,670
Slap it on real quick, we've got
to get going.

1514
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:33,190
That ta boy.

1515
01:16:36,110 --> 01:16:38,710
So, uh... you're, uh...

1516
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:41,350
Santa Claus. Right.

1517
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:46,230
Would you mind taking this to
your firstborn?

1518
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:46,710
Sure.

1519
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:49,830
Um, uh, and my firstborn, he's
an elf?

1520
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:53,350
Yes. Actually, I'm adopted.

1521
01:16:53,670 --> 01:16:57,510
Uh, Michael, would you open this
hatch for me, please?

1522
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:04,950
That ta boy, thank you.

1523
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:08,550
So, you're really Santa Claus?

1524
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:11,150
You never can tell, kid.

1525
01:17:11,190 --> 01:17:11,950
Tell me, Michael,

1526
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:13,630
What do you want for Christmas?

1527
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:16,670
I wanted a skateboard.

1528
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:20,070
Oh, not just skateboard.

1529
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:23,470
Arealhuf board. Looked here.

1530
01:17:23,470 --> 01:17:24,830
Looked here...

1531
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:26,830
How do you like them apples?

1532
01:17:26,870 --> 01:17:29,470
Go look and see.

1533
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:36,910
Whoa.

1534
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:44,310
What happened?

1535
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:46,990
You made my sleigh fly.

1536
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:47,670
What do you mean?

1537
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:49,790
Well, before the turbine days,

1538
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:52,710
This baby used to run solely on
Christmas spirit.

1539
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:55,990
You believed in me. You made my
sleigh fly.

1540
01:17:56,030 --> 01:17:59,190
Hold it... if you're really Santa
Claus,

1541
01:17:59,230 --> 01:18:01,550
Then we can just get some news
cameras in here,

1542
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:02,750
And everyone will believe in you,

1543
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:03,830
Then your sleigh will fly, right?

1544
01:18:03,870 --> 01:18:06,750
Christmas spirit is about believing,
not seeing.

1545
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:09,590
If the whole world saw me,
all would be lost.

1546
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:13,630
The paparazzi have been trying to
nail me for years.

1547
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:17,750
Hey, look!

1548
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:29,910
It's the central park rangers.

1549
01:18:33,990 --> 01:18:39,070
Dad, Michael... I got a plan.

1550
01:18:46,510 --> 01:18:49,110
Whoa, wait! Wait, Michael...
my list!

1551
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:51,790
You bring that list back right now,
you hear me?!

1552
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:53,750
Come on, give me your hat and coat.

1553
01:18:53,790 --> 01:18:56,590
Mrs. Claus made them for me.

1554
01:19:00,670 --> 01:19:03,550
Hey! Hey, here I am!

1555
01:19:05,350 --> 01:19:06,230
Ho ho ho!

1556
01:19:06,270 --> 01:19:10,750
Hey, ho ho ho! Hey! Hey!

1557
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:19,790
Excuse me. Thank you. Excuse me.

1558
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:21,670
So the authorities have not
discovered

1559
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:23,430
Any reindeer in the park?

1560
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:24,910
No, no reindeer. Sleigh bells?

1561
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:26,110
No, no sleigh bells, either.

1562
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:27,270
Elves? Excuse me, please.

1563
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:28,430
None of that, we really just
need everyone...

1564
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:29,430
It's him, it's the real Santa!

1565
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:31,190
His sleigh won't fly,' cause nobody
believes in him!

1566
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:33,030
Did you see something
in the park?

1567
01:19:33,070 --> 01:19:33,630
Everyone out there,

1568
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:36,070
Santa needs us to believe,
I can prove he's real.

1569
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:36,870
Look, this is his list!

1570
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:39,750
Okay... well, further confirmation

1571
01:19:39,790 --> 01:19:42,270
That there has been a Santa
sighting tonight.

1572
01:19:42,270 --> 01:19:43,310
We have the naughty and nice list.

1573
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:45,550
Lynn Kessler wants a power puff
girls play set.

1574
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:47,910
Mark weber wants an electric
guitar.

1575
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:48,190
Yes!

1576
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:51,910
Carolyn Reynolds wants a Suzy-
talks-a-lot.

1577
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:52,990
Thanks, buddy.

1578
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:53,950
Dirk Lawson wants

1579
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:55,230
A day of pampering at burke
Williams spa.

1580
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:59,230
Stan Tobias wants a power pumper
water pistol.

1581
01:20:00,030 --> 01:20:01,150
Must be another dirk Lawson.

1582
01:20:01,150 --> 01:20:03,470
Dave keckler wants some Nike
shocks.

1583
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:05,590
Okay, uh, well, obviously we have

1584
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:07,630
A new development in the story, uh,

1585
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:10,150
A confirmation that Santa must
have been sighted

1586
01:20:10,190 --> 01:20:11,910
Because we have his book right
here.

1587
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:13,590
what's your name?

1588
01:20:13,630 --> 01:20:16,830
Uh, I'm charlotte den on, New York one.

1589
01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:19,270
"D," "D..."

1590
01:20:19,870 --> 01:20:22,150
Charlotte den on wants tiffany
engagement ring

1591
01:20:22,190 --> 01:20:24,470
And for her boyfriend to stop
dragging his feet

1592
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:25,470
And commit already.

1593
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:31,070
We've got power!

1594
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:33,310
Charlotte...
charlotte?

1595
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:35,070
Hey, turn the cameras back on!

1596
01:20:35,110 --> 01:20:36,190
Who told you to say that?

1597
01:20:36,230 --> 01:20:37,030
It's the real Santa.

1598
01:20:37,070 --> 01:20:39,070
We need to get these cameras
back on.

1599
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:40,190
He needs our help!

1600
01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:42,470
Hey, Michael, are you okay?

1601
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:43,110
Yeah, I'm fine.

1602
01:20:43,150 --> 01:20:46,270
But buddy, he's... he's in the
park with Santa,

1603
01:20:46,310 --> 01:20:47,430
The sleigh won't fly

1604
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:49,390
'cause there's no Christmas
spirit.

1605
01:20:49,430 --> 01:20:52,150
Michael! Mom!

1606
01:20:52,190 --> 01:20:54,830
Michael! Ohh!

1607
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:57,030
Are you okay? I'm fine.

1608
01:20:57,070 --> 01:20:59,950
The best way to spread
Christmas cheer

1609
01:20:59,990 --> 01:21:03,910
Is singing loud for all
to hear.

1610
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:10,830
Buddy... better get going,
get in now!

1611
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:13,590
Santa, I'm not done with the
engine yet!

1612
01:21:13,630 --> 01:21:14,790
Can't wait!

1613
01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:17,230
On, dasher, on, dancer...

1614
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:19,590
I'm not done with the engine!

1615
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:24,390
That's okay.

1616
01:21:24,430 --> 01:21:27,590
You get started, I'll catch up!

1617
01:21:32,270 --> 01:21:34,710
You know, he wasn't lying.

1618
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:37,190
Merry Christmas.

1619
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:43,630
Santa, I can't...

1620
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:46,150
Stop messing around and get in!

1621
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:49,350
Aah!

1622
01:21:54,190 --> 01:21:56,230
Santa, why are they chasing us?!

1623
01:21:56,230 --> 01:21:58,230
I put the mon the naughty list,

1624
01:21:58,270 --> 01:22:00,550
And they never forgave me.

1625
01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:09,390
You better watch out,
you better not cry

1626
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:13,030
You better not pout,
I'm telling you why

1627
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:17,790
Santa Clausis coming' to town

1628
01:22:17,830 --> 01:22:22,470
Yaah, yaah, yaah!

1629
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:25,470
Up, up, pull up!

1630
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:29,670
Buddy! We need power, we're
gonna crash!

1631
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:33,590
He's making a list,
Checking it twice

1632
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:37,510
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

1633
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:42,790
Santa clausis coming' to town

1634
01:22:42,830 --> 01:22:48,030
He sees you when you're sleeping

1635
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:50,790
He knows when you're awake

1636
01:22:50,830 --> 01:22:54,470
He knows if you've been bad or good

1637
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:57,070
So be good for goodness sake

1638
01:22:57,110 --> 01:23:01,270
Oh, you better watch out,
you better not cry

1639
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:05,430
You better not pout, I'm telling
you why

1640
01:23:05,470 --> 01:23:11,270
Santa Clausis coming to town

1641
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:18,350
Aah!

1642
01:23:18,350 --> 01:23:20,830
You can do it!
Come on, dancer.

1643
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:22,750
That's my boy.

1644
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:24,710
Pull, cupid! Aah!

1645
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,630
Pull, dasher!

1646
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:30,670
I'm getting too old for this job.

1647
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:32,110
Now!

1648
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:46,510
The engine's gone!

1649
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:47,670
We're toast!

1650
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:55,150
Well, still no sign of Santa,

1651
01:23:55,190 --> 01:23:57,190
But some spontaneous Christmas
caroling

1652
01:23:57,230 --> 01:23:58,030
Has broken out

1653
01:23:58,070 --> 01:24:00,030
Right herein front of central
park.

1654
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:01,030
Let's have a listen in.

1655
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:02,830
He sees you when you're sleeping

1656
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:06,190
He knows if you're awake

1657
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:10,030
He knows if you've been bad or
good

1658
01:24:10,030 --> 01:24:13,670
So be good for goodness sake

1659
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:14,070
Hey!

1660
01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:17,710
You better watch out, you better
not cry

1661
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:21,350
You better not pout, I'm telling
you why

1662
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:21,710
Come on!

1663
01:24:21,710 --> 01:24:25,830
Santa claus is coming' to town

1664
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:29,950
Just a little more!

1665
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:35,950
Hal-yah!

1666
01:24:35,990 --> 01:24:38,510
He knows when you're awake

1667
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:39,750
He knows if you've

1668
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:42,230
Wait... you're not singing.

1669
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:43,150
Yes, I am.

1670
01:24:43,190 --> 01:24:46,270
No, you're not. You're just moving
your lips.

1671
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:48,030
Santa!

1672
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:50,550
Michael, please, what's the big deal?

1673
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:51,310
Dad.

1674
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:52,270
I'm telling you why

1675
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:57,830
Santa clausis coming to town

1676
01:25:05,870 --> 01:25:07,750
Oh! Ha ha ha!

1677
01:25:07,790 --> 01:25:09,830
Now, my beauties!

1678
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:17,830
Bye-bye.

1679
01:25:17,870 --> 01:25:19,190
Just like the old days!

1680
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:22,110
Charlotte? Charlotte?

1681
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:24,750
Well, I guess we'll never know for
sure

1682
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:26,670
What happened this Christmas Eve?

1683
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:27,950
In central park.

1684
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:33,870
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!

1685
01:25:33,910 --> 01:25:36,630
Ho ho ho!

1686
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:39,470
And so, with a little help,

1687
01:25:39,510 --> 01:25:41,350
Buddy managed to save Christmas.

1688
01:25:41,390 --> 01:25:44,150
And his spirit saved a lot of other
People, too.

1689
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:50,670
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1690
01:25:50,710 --> 01:25:56,750
And never brought to mind

1691
01:25:56,790 --> 01:26:03,750
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1692
01:26:03,790 --> 01:26:07,190
Walter started his own independent
publishing company.

1693
01:26:07,230 --> 01:26:09,830
His first book was written by a
brand new,

1694
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:12,430
Critically acclaimed children's
author.

1695
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:14,150
The book was elf...

1696
01:26:14,190 --> 01:26:15,830
A, uh, fictional story

1697
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:17,870
About an adopted elf named buddy

1698
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:19,870
Who was raised in the North Pole?

1699
01:26:19,870 --> 01:26:21,790
Went to New York, ate spaghetti,

1700
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:24,110
Worked in a shiny mailroom,

1701
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:26,310
And eventually saved Christmas.

1702
01:26:26,350 --> 01:26:28,990
"First, I traveled through the
seven levels

1703
01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:31,230
"Of the candy cane forest,

1704
01:26:31,230 --> 01:26:35,630
"Past the sea of twirly-swirly
gumdrops,

1705
01:26:35,670 --> 01:26:40,310
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel."

1706
01:26:40,350 --> 01:26:42,430
And as for me, I can't complain.

1707
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:44,790
Buddy comes up to visit from time
to time.

1708
01:26:44,830 --> 01:26:48,190
In the meadow we can build a
snowman

1709
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:51,550
And pretend that he is parson
brown

1710
01:26:51,590 --> 01:26:54,670
Oh, thank you, Jovie. That's very
sweet of you.

1711
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:56,110
You're welcome, papa.

1712
01:26:56,150 --> 01:26:59,990
But you can do the job when
you're in town

1713
01:27:00,030 --> 01:27:01,430
Hey, Suzie.

1714
01:27:01,470 --> 01:27:02,310
Come here, little one.

1715
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:04,790
When it snows, ain't it
thrilling?

1716
01:27:04,830 --> 01:27:06,190
Papa wants to see you.

1717
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:09,670
Though your nose get a
little chilling

1718
01:27:09,710 --> 01:27:10,030
Buddy...

1719
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:12,230
We'll frolic and play buddy...
buddy...

1720
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:18,270
The Eskimo way, walking in a
winter wonderland

1721
01:27:34,830 --> 01:27:38,870
In the meadow we can build a
snowman

1722
01:27:38,910 --> 01:27:42,910
And pretend that he is parson
brown

1723
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:47,150
He'll say, are you married,
we'll say no, man

1724
01:27:47,190 --> 01:27:51,390
But you can do the job when you
in town, brother

1725
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:55,790
Later on, we'll conspire

1726
01:27:55,830 --> 01:28:00,150
As we dream by the fire

1727
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:04,430
To face unafraid the plans
That we made

1728
01:28:04,470 --> 01:28:08,590
Walking in a winter wonderland

1729
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:12,710
Walking in a winter wonderland

1730
01:28:23,710 --> 01:28:25,070
I really can't stay

1731
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:29,430
But, baby, it's cold outside

1732
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:30,470
I've got to go 'way

1733
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:34,070
But, baby, it's cold outside

1734
01:28:34,110 --> 01:28:36,230
This evening has been

1735
01:28:36,270 --> 01:28:38,910
Been hoping that you'd drop in

1736
01:28:38,950 --> 01:28:40,230
So very nice

1737
01:28:40,270 --> 01:28:45,270
I'll hold your hands, they're
just like ice

1738
01:28:45,310 --> 01:28:47,710
My mother will start to worry

1739
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:50,110
Beautiful, what's your hurry?

1740
01:28:50,150 --> 01:28:53,390
And father will be pacing the floor

1741
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:55,830
Listen to that fireplace roar

1742
01:28:55,870 --> 01:28:58,190
So, really, I'd better scurry

1743
01:28:58,230 --> 01:29:00,470
Beautiful, please don't hurry

1744
01:29:00,510 --> 01:29:03,510
Well, maybe just a half a drink more

1745
01:29:03,550 --> 01:29:06,510
Put some records on while I pour

1746
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:08,790
The neighbors might think

1747
01:29:08,830 --> 01:29:10,790
Baby, it's bad out there

1748
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:13,790
Say, what's in this drink?

1749
01:29:13,830 --> 01:29:16,750
No cabs to be had out there

1750
01:29:16,790 --> 01:29:18,390
I wish I knew how

1751
01:29:18,430 --> 01:29:20,710
Your eyes are like starlight now

1752
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:22,550
To break the spell

1753
01:29:22,590 --> 01:29:27,430
I'll take your hat, your hair
looks swell

1754
01:29:27,470 --> 01:29:30,230
I ought to say no, no, no, sir

1755
01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:32,270
Mind if I move in closer?

1756
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:35,350
At least I'm gonna say that I
tried

1757
01:29:35,390 --> 01:29:38,390
What's the sense of hurting
my pride?

1758
01:29:38,430 --> 01:29:40,230
I really can't stay

1759
01:29:40,270 --> 01:29:41,990
Baby, don't hold out

1760
01:29:42,030 --> 01:29:48,710
Ah, but it's cold outside

1761
01:29:56,670 --> 01:29:57,870
I simply must go

1762
01:29:57,870 --> 01:30:01,710
But, baby, it's cold outside

1763
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:03,550
The answer is no

1764
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:06,710
But, baby, it's cold outside

1765
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:08,430
This welcome has been

1766
01:30:08,430 --> 01:30:11,030
I'm lucky that you dropped in

1767
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:12,910
So nice and warm

1768
01:30:12,910 --> 01:30:17,750
Look out the window at that
storm

1769
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:20,310
My sister will be suspicious

1770
01:30:20,350 --> 01:30:22,790
Gosh, your lips look delicious

1771
01:30:22,830 --> 01:30:25,910
My brother will be there at
the door

1772
01:30:25,950 --> 01:30:28,030
Waves upon tropical shore

1773
01:30:28,070 --> 01:30:30,670
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious

1774
01:30:30,710 --> 01:30:33,270
Oh, your lips look delicious

1775
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:35,630
Well, maybe just a cigarette more

1776
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:38,990
Never such a pleasure before

1777
01:30:39,030 --> 01:30:40,750
I've got to get home

1778
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:43,390
But, baby, you'll freeze out there

1779
01:30:43,430 --> 01:30:45,110
Say, lend me your comb

1780
01:30:45,150 --> 01:30:48,990
It's up to your knees out there

1781
01:30:49,030 --> 01:30:50,990
You've really been grand

1782
01:30:51,030 --> 01:30:52,950
I thrill when you touch my hand

1783
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:54,990
But don't you see

1784
01:30:54,990 --> 01:30:58,590
How can you do this thing to me?

1785
01:30:58,630 --> 01:31:02,190
There's bound to be talk tomorrow

1786
01:31:02,230 --> 01:31:05,230
Think of my lifelong sorrow

1787
01:31:05,270 --> 01:31:07,870
At least there will be plenty
implied

1788
01:31:07,910 --> 01:31:10,750
If you caught pneumonia and died

1789
01:31:10,790 --> 01:31:12,270
I really can't stay

1790
01:31:12,310 --> 01:31:14,670
Get rid of that hold out

1791
01:31:14,710 --> 01:31:18,510
Ah, but it's cold

1792
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:23,990
Outside
