1
00:00:29,034 --> 00:00:29,618
Oh, hello.

2
00:00:29,618 --> 00:00:31,536
You're, uh, you're probably here

3
00:00:31,536 --> 00:00:34,289
About the, Uh, the story.

4
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:35,748
Elves love to tell stories.

5
00:00:35,748 --> 00:00:38,542
I-I'll bet you didn't know that
about elves.

6
00:00:38,542 --> 00:00:41,086
There's, uh, probably a lot of things

7
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:43,130
You... you didn't know about elves.

8
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:47,843
Another... another interesting
Uh, elf ism

9
00:00:47,843 --> 00:00:53,264
Uh, there are only three jobs available
to an elf.

10
00:00:53,264 --> 00:00:54,807
The first is making shoes at night

11
00:00:54,807 --> 00:00:56,517
While, you know, while the old...

12
00:00:56,517 --> 00:00:58,185
The old cobbler sleeps.

13
00:00:58,185 --> 00:01:01,230
Lazy bum. Couldn't even make a clog.

14
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,856
You can bake cookies

15
00:01:02,856 --> 00:01:03,691
In a tree. Hey!

16
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:06,777
As you can imagine, it's, uh, dangerous
Having an oven

17
00:01:06,777 --> 00:01:09,279
In an oak tree during the dry season.

18
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:11,031
Screaming I wanna make shoes!

19
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:13,575
But the third job... uh, some call
It, uh,

20
00:01:13,575 --> 00:01:15,827
"The show," or... or "the big dance,"

21
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:19,205
It's the profession that every elf
Aspires to,

22
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:24,084
And that is to build toys in
Santa's workshop.

23
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,295
Only two weeks left till Christmas!

24
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:29,798
I-it's a job only an elf can do.

25
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:30,674
Our... our nimble fingers,

26
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,634
Natural cheer and active minds

27
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,761
Are perfect for toy-building.

28
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,722
They... they tried using gnomes
And trolls,

29
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,599
But the gnomes drank too much...

30
00:01:42,142 --> 00:01:44,937
...and the trolls weren't toilet
trained.

31
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:50,567
No human being has ever set... set
foot in Santa's workshop.

32
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:53,361
Uh, that is until about 30 years ago,

33
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:55,405
And, as you may have guessed,

34
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:59,325
That's where our story begins.

35
00:02:31,396 --> 00:02:32,856
Wow!

36
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,193
Whoa!

37
00:03:13,685 --> 00:03:15,728
Ooh!

38
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:16,813
Wow!

39
00:03:16,813 --> 00:03:18,397
Wow!

40
00:03:24,445 --> 00:03:26,238
Humming

41
00:03:26,238 --> 00:03:29,491
Ow! Ow!

42
00:03:43,462 --> 00:03:44,880
Whoa!

43
00:03:47,758 --> 00:03:49,968
Are you sleepy?

44
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:51,761
Here we are.

45
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:56,349
We're just going to make you feel
so comfortable.

46
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:59,185
Here we are.

47
00:03:59,185 --> 00:04:00,436
There you are.

48
00:04:00,436 --> 00:04:03,689
It's time to go to sleep.

49
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:07,234
Maybe by next Christmas you'll
Have a home.

50
00:04:13,531 --> 00:04:17,493
Merry Christmas, my angel.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,419
Creaking

52
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:46,895
Santa: Mmm...

53
00:04:52,734 --> 00:04:54,777
Bars clang

54
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:18,924
Cheering music playing

55
00:05:25,514 --> 00:05:28,308
All right, all right.

56
00:05:28,308 --> 00:05:31,811
We've had another very successful
year.

57
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:33,605
Cheering

58
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:35,565
So, after all that hard work,

59
00:05:35,565 --> 00:05:38,776
It's time to start preparations

60
00:05:38,776 --> 00:05:40,403
For next Christmas!

61
00:05:40,403 --> 00:05:43,864
Cheering

62
00:05:49,286 --> 00:05:53,957
What in the name of Sam hill
Is that?

63
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,793
Elves: Wow...

64
00:06:00,546 --> 00:06:02,840
Male elf: A baby...

65
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:07,844
Elf: "little buddy diapers."

66
00:06:07,844 --> 00:06:09,971
His name is buddy. He must've...

67
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:12,348
Snuck into your sack at the
orphanage.

68
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:12,849
What do we do?

69
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:16,018
Papa elf: So, Santa had a
Decision to make,

70
00:06:16,018 --> 00:06:18,104
And fortunately, when it
Comes to babies,

71
00:06:18,104 --> 00:06:19,438
Santa's a... a pushover.

72
00:06:19,438 --> 00:06:21,649
So, buddy stayed with, uh
An older elf

73
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:22,608
Who had always wanted a child?

74
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:25,152
But had been so committed to
Building toys, he...

75
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:29,990
He, well, had forgotten to
Settle down.

76
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,615
Santa.

77
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:33,868
Yes, yes, I... I raised buddy.

78
00:06:33,868 --> 00:06:36,120
I was his adopted father.

79
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,872
Though buddy grew twice as fast,

80
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:42,084
He... he wasn't any different from
the other children.

81
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:45,170
Chuckles not too fast, buddy.

82
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,381
I mean, not... not really.

83
00:06:47,381 --> 00:06:49,132
Before we learn how to build
The latest

84
00:06:49,132 --> 00:06:51,134
In extreme graphic chipset
Processors,

85
00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:53,887
Let's recite the
"Code of the elves,"

86
00:06:53,887 --> 00:06:54,929
Shall we?

87
00:06:54,929 --> 00:06:55,596
Number one.

88
00:06:55,596 --> 00:06:58,557
"Treat every day like Christmas."

89
00:06:58,557 --> 00:06:59,350
Number two.

90
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,354
"There's room for everyone on the
Nice list."

91
00:07:03,354 --> 00:07:04,480
Number three.

92
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,858
"The best way to spread Christmas
Cheer

93
00:07:07,858 --> 00:07:11,695
Is singing loud for all to hear."

94
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:13,863
And one day, when buddy was
old enough,

95
00:07:13,863 --> 00:07:17,200
I made him my own personal
apprentice.

96
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,951
I've never been in this room
before.

97
00:07:18,951 --> 00:07:20,911
Well, I think it's time you start

98
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:22,871
Your tinker training.

99
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:26,959
Gasps Santa's sleigh.

100
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,586
You're gonna help me make it fly.

101
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:33,673
I thought the magical reindeer made
The sleighs fly.

102
00:07:33,673 --> 00:07:36,467
And where do the reindeer get
their magic from?

103
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:40,971
Christmas spirit. Everybody
knows that.

104
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:44,141
Well, silly as it sounds,

105
00:07:44,141 --> 00:07:45,142
A lot of people down south

106
00:07:45,142 --> 00:07:47,060
Don't believe in Santa Claus.

107
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,895
What?!

108
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:52,107
Well, who do they think puts all?
their toys under the tree?

109
00:07:52,107 --> 00:07:53,900
Well, there's a rumor floating around

110
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,943
That, uh, that the parents do it.

111
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:57,904
That's... that's ridiculous.

112
00:07:57,904 --> 00:08:00,906
I mean, parents couldn't do that
all in one night.

113
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:02,032
What about Santa's cookies?

114
00:08:02,032 --> 00:08:04,493
I suppose parents eat them, too?

115
00:08:04,493 --> 00:08:05,577
Yeah, I, uh, I... I know,

116
00:08:05,577 --> 00:08:08,038
Uh, and every earless and less
People

117
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:08,747
Believe in Santa Claus.

118
00:08:08,747 --> 00:08:12,167
I mean, we have a real energy
crisis on our hands.

119
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:12,667
Oh.

120
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:16,629
I mean, just see how low the, uh
Claus meter is.

121
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,673
That's shocking.

122
00:08:18,673 --> 00:08:20,174
That's why I came up

123
00:08:20,174 --> 00:08:22,593
With this little beauty in the '60s.

124
00:08:22,593 --> 00:08:26,096
Engine hums to life

125
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,473
WH-what is it?

126
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:29,975
It's a cringle 3000...

127
00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:33,645
A 500-reindeer power jet turbine
engine.

128
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:35,188
Without it, the sleigh couldn't

129
00:08:35,188 --> 00:08:39,108
Get more than, uh, a few feet off
the ground.

130
00:08:40,985 --> 00:08:42,069
Well, it looks like we got

131
00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:44,071
A short in the thermo coupler.

132
00:08:44,071 --> 00:08:46,573
You wanna give me a hand with that?

133
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:48,075
You want me to help?

134
00:08:48,075 --> 00:08:50,452
As much as, uh, buddy was accepted

135
00:08:50,452 --> 00:08:53,037
By his family and friends,

136
00:08:53,037 --> 00:08:54,747
There were a few drawbacks

137
00:08:54,747 --> 00:08:58,542
To being, uh, a human in, uh
an elf's world.

138
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:01,504
Music plays chattering

139
00:09:19,603 --> 00:09:21,730
Hey, Ming Ming.

140
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,731
Um...

141
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:27,069
I'm gonna be a little bit short
on today's quota.

142
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:28,153
It's all right, buddy.

143
00:09:28,153 --> 00:09:29,696
Just how many etch-a-sketches

144
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:32,699
Did you get finished?

145
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:36,202
Come on, buddy. How many?

146
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:40,498
I made, uh... 85.

147
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:48,046
Eighty-five?

148
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,590
That puts you...

149
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,592
915 off the pace.

150
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,135
Female elf: Ooh... that's bad.

151
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,553
Why don't you just say it?

152
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,805
I'm the worst toy maker in
the world.

153
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,599
I'm a cotton-headed ninny-muggins.

154
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:01,142
Gasps

155
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,019
No, buddy, you're not cotton-
headed ninny-muggins.

156
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:07,105
We all just have different talents
That's all.

157
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:08,065
Seems like everyone else

158
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,524
Have the same talents
except for me.

159
00:10:09,524 --> 00:10:12,318
You... you have, you have lots of
Talents, uh...

160
00:10:12,318 --> 00:10:15,863
Special talents in fact, like
Um, uh...

161
00:10:15,863 --> 00:10:16,656
Special talents?

162
00:10:16,656 --> 00:10:19,367
You changed the batteries in the
smoke detector.

163
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:20,159
You sure did... aaa's.

164
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,370
And in six months, you'll have
to check'em again...

165
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,121
Won't he?

166
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:26,832
And you're the only baritone in
the elf choir.

167
00:10:26,832 --> 00:10:29,084
You bring us down whole octave.

168
00:10:29,084 --> 00:10:31,086
In a good way.

169
00:10:31,086 --> 00:10:31,711
See, buddy?

170
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:33,880
You're not a cotton-headed ninny-
muggings.

171
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,717
You're just... special.

172
00:10:38,301 --> 00:10:43,680
And so, buddy was sent where the...
The special elves work.

173
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,849
Devilish laughter aah!

174
00:10:52,147 --> 00:10:54,899
(Pop goes the weasel playing

175
00:10:57,235 --> 00:10:59,737
Laughter ah!

176
00:10:59,737 --> 00:11:01,238
Sighs

177
00:11:05,826 --> 00:11:08,620
(Pop goes the weasel playing

178
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:19,338
Laughter

179
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:21,674
Hey, foom foom...

180
00:11:21,674 --> 00:11:23,926
I hate to do this to you, but you
Think you could

181
00:11:23,926 --> 00:11:26,261
Help me pick up the slack on those
etch-a-sketches?

182
00:11:26,261 --> 00:11:28,388
No problem. I appreciate it.

183
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:29,097
Buddy is killing me.

184
00:11:29,097 --> 00:11:32,684
I already got lum lum and choochoo pulling' doubles.

185
00:11:32,684 --> 00:11:33,851
That was quick thinking yesterday

186
00:11:33,851 --> 00:11:35,770
With that ¡°special talents¡± thing.

187
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,104
Ming Ming: I feel bad for the guy.

188
00:11:37,104 --> 00:11:38,314
I just hope he doesn't get wise.

189
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:41,901
Well, if he hasn't figured out
He's a human by now,

190
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,278
I don't think he ever will.

191
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:50,242
Foom foom: If he hasn't figured
Out he's a human

192
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:53,286
By now, I don't think he ever will.

193
00:11:54,287 --> 00:11:57,206
I think they're too small.

194
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:03,128
Ming Ming: You're just... special.

195
00:12:05,631 --> 00:12:07,883
Snores

196
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:11,302
Buddy sings deeply

197
00:12:11,302 --> 00:12:12,887
Sneakers screech

198
00:12:12,887 --> 00:12:15,431
Devilish laughter

199
00:12:20,728 --> 00:12:22,896
You don't look so good, buddy.

200
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:23,439
Are you okay?

201
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:26,942
I'll be okay, I just need a glass
of water.

202
00:12:26,942 --> 00:12:29,152
Aah!

203
00:12:29,694 --> 00:12:32,155
Buddy...

204
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:35,450
Unh! Aah!

205
00:12:51,297 --> 00:12:52,674
Knock on door

206
00:12:52,674 --> 00:12:55,718
Buddy, are you okay?

207
00:12:55,718 --> 00:12:56,761
I'm sorry, papa.

208
00:12:56,761 --> 00:12:59,180
I just need some alone time.

209
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,765
Buddy, I... I think we... we have
to talk.

210
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:05,018
Buddy, uh, I think there's something

211
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:08,021
I... I probably should tell you.

212
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:11,483
You probably should have found
out a long...

213
00:13:11,483 --> 00:13:12,692
A long time ago.

214
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:15,737
I then proceeded to tell buddy of
how his father

215
00:13:15,737 --> 00:13:18,364
Had fallen in love when he was
very young

216
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,575
With a beautiful girl named
Susan wells,

217
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:22,743
And how buddy was born

218
00:13:22,743 --> 00:13:25,245
And put up for adoption by
his mother,

219
00:13:25,245 --> 00:13:28,206
And how she had later passed away.

220
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:29,249
I... I told him his father

221
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:31,751
Had never even known that
Buddy was born,

222
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:32,544
And most importantly,

223
00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:34,462
I told him where his father was...

224
00:13:34,462 --> 00:13:38,549
Uh, in a magical land called
new York City.

225
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:40,468
My dad works there?

226
00:13:40,468 --> 00:13:43,262
Empire state building.

227
00:13:47,474 --> 00:13:49,851
Hey, buddy, wanna pick some
snow berries?

228
00:13:49,851 --> 00:13:52,729
Not now, arctic puffin.

229
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,858
Hello, buddy. Oh... hi, Leon.

230
00:13:57,858 --> 00:13:58,985
Why the long face, partner?

231
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:02,279
It seems I'm... I'm not an elf.

232
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,947
'Course you're not. You're 6'3"

233
00:14:03,947 --> 00:14:06,950
And had a beard since you were 15.

234
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,076
Papa says my real father

235
00:14:08,076 --> 00:14:11,246
Lives in a magical place far away.

236
00:14:11,246 --> 00:14:12,539
I don't know what to do.

237
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:13,331
At least you have a daddy.

238
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:17,543
I was just rolled up one day and
left out here in the cold.

239
00:14:17,543 --> 00:14:20,254
But the thing is, I've never even left
the North Pole.

240
00:14:20,254 --> 00:14:22,798
Buddy, I've been around the world
Many times

241
00:14:22,798 --> 00:14:25,008
When I was a young cumulus
nimbus cloud.

242
00:14:25,008 --> 00:14:28,845
It's a wonderful place, filled with
Wondrous creatures...

243
00:14:28,845 --> 00:14:29,387
Except dogs.

244
00:14:29,387 --> 00:14:32,265
Oh, by the way, don't eat the
yellow snow.

245
00:14:32,265 --> 00:14:32,891
Oh, I know that.

246
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:36,978
All I'm say in' is, this might be
The golden opportunity

247
00:14:36,978 --> 00:14:39,772
To find out whom you really are.

248
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,943
So, I hear you're going

249
00:14:44,943 --> 00:14:47,863
On a little journey to
the big city.

250
00:14:47,863 --> 00:14:49,072
Yup. Ahh.

251
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:50,323
I'm kind a nervous.

252
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:50,949
Chuckles

253
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:52,909
Leon says New York is pretty
different.

254
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:53,993
Oh, don't pay attention to Leon.

255
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:57,955
He's never been anywhere.
He doesn't have any feet.

256
00:14:57,955 --> 00:15:00,583
I've been to New York thousands
of times.

257
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,001
Really? Mm-hmm.

258
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:02,584
What's it like?

259
00:15:02,584 --> 00:15:05,420
Well, there are some things you
should know.

260
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,881
First off, you see gum on
The street,

261
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:10,592
Leave it there. It's not
free candy.

262
00:15:10,592 --> 00:15:11,843
Oh. Second,

263
00:15:11,843 --> 00:15:15,096
There are, like, 30 ray's
pizzas.

264
00:15:15,096 --> 00:15:16,931
They all claim to be the
Original,

265
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:18,599
But the real one' son 11th.

266
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:21,936
And if you see a sign that
Says "peep show,"

267
00:15:21,936 --> 00:15:23,812
That doesn't mean that
They're letting you

268
00:15:23,812 --> 00:15:27,065
Look at presents before Christmas.

269
00:15:27,065 --> 00:15:27,899
Can't wait to see my dad...

270
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:31,403
We're gonna go ices skating and...
And eat sugar plums.

271
00:15:31,403 --> 00:15:32,987
Yeah, that's the other thing

272
00:15:32,987 --> 00:15:35,990
I wanted to talk to you about.

273
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:39,869
You know, buddy... sighs

274
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:41,996
Your father...

275
00:15:41,996 --> 00:15:45,415
Well... he's on the naughty list.

276
00:15:45,415 --> 00:15:48,877
No!!!

277
00:15:49,836 --> 00:15:54,007
You're taking the books back?

278
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:55,008
Chuckles

279
00:15:55,008 --> 00:15:57,343
See, I... I see what you're trying
to do here.

280
00:15:57,343 --> 00:15:59,095
Y-you're trying to make me feel bad,

281
00:15:59,095 --> 00:16:01,013
When, in actuality, you're the one

282
00:16:01,013 --> 00:16:02,097
That missed the payments.

283
00:16:02,097 --> 00:16:06,018
But the children love the books.

284
00:16:06,018 --> 00:16:06,893
I know that, uh...

285
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:09,145
You know, I'm the one that ran
The focus groups,

286
00:16:09,145 --> 00:16:10,647
But I like hearing that.

287
00:16:10,647 --> 00:16:14,025
Listen, some people, they just
Lose sight

288
00:16:14,025 --> 00:16:15,860
Of what's important in life.

289
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:21,657
That doesn't mean they can't find
their way again, huh?

290
00:16:21,657 --> 00:16:22,533
Maybe all they need

291
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:25,160
Is just a little Christmas spirit.

292
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,121
Cheering

293
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:30,665
Well, uh, I... I'm good at that.

294
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:33,168
I know you are.

295
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,930
And I'll...

296
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:47,639
I'll always, uh,

297
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,684
I'll always be here for you.

298
00:16:57,148 --> 00:16:58,941
Now, uh...

299
00:16:58,941 --> 00:17:01,986
Go... uh, get.

300
00:17:12,954 --> 00:17:13,705
Bye, guys.

301
00:17:13,705 --> 00:17:16,999
Bye, buddy. Bye, buddy. Take care.

302
00:17:16,999 --> 00:17:18,959
Bye-bye.

303
00:17:20,628 --> 00:17:22,254
Bye-bye.

304
00:17:22,254 --> 00:17:23,505
Bye-bye, buddy.

There, there.

307
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:30,470
Huh?

308
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,264
Oh! Ohh!

309
00:17:36,017 --> 00:17:39,186
Bye, buddy. Hope you find your dad.

310
00:17:39,186 --> 00:17:41,146
Thanks, Mr. Narwhal.

311
00:17:41,981 --> 00:17:43,440
Bye.

312
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:36,531
Hey! What's your name?

313
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:39,241
My name's buddy.

314
00:18:42,494 --> 00:18:43,787
Ohh!

315
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,291
Does someone need a hug?

316
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,335
Raccoon chirping

317
00:18:52,212 --> 00:18:55,048
aah, aah! That's not cool!

318
00:18:55,048 --> 00:18:56,132
Screech

319
00:18:56,132 --> 00:18:58,217
I just wanted a hug!

(Pennies from heaven playing

321
00:19:39,213 --> 00:19:40,548
Hi.

322
00:19:40,548 --> 00:19:42,341
Hello.

00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:51,057
Thank you.

Thank you.

00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,299
Not Santa.

332
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:28,800
Thank you.

333
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,302
Thank you.

334
00:20:54,282 --> 00:20:56,701
Screaming

335
00:21:17,637 --> 00:21:19,680
Thank you. Hey, you know what?
No.

336
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,140
No, all right? Thank you.

337
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,684
Get outta here, get outta here.

338
00:21:43,452 --> 00:21:45,829
Elevator chimes

339
00:21:54,003 --> 00:21:55,838
Elevator chimes

340
00:21:58,466 --> 00:22:01,177
Hello. Hi.

341
00:22:01,177 --> 00:22:02,761
Ooh...

342
00:22:04,805 --> 00:22:08,725
Gasps beautiful.

343
00:22:18,943 --> 00:22:21,487
Looks like a Christmas tree.

344
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,865
A reprint?

345
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:26,742
You know how much that's gonna
cost?

346
00:22:26,742 --> 00:22:27,951
Two whole pages are missing.

347
00:22:27,951 --> 00:22:29,202
The story doesn't make any sense.

348
00:22:29,202 --> 00:22:30,954
What, you think some kid's gonna
notice two pages?

349
00:22:30,954 --> 00:22:33,706
I mean, they... all they do is look
at pictures.

350
00:22:33,706 --> 00:22:35,333
Elevator chimes gasps

351
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,752
Sorry I can't ride with you the
Rest of the way up,

352
00:22:37,752 --> 00:22:40,713
But this is where my dad works.
Well, have a good...

353
00:22:40,713 --> 00:22:41,964
Oh, I forgot to give you a hug!

354
00:22:41,964 --> 00:22:43,924
Oh, I don't know, Connie,
I've never

355
00:22:43,924 --> 00:22:45,384
Declared kittens before.

356
00:22:45,384 --> 00:22:46,385
How many?

357
00:22:46,385 --> 00:22:47,928
Gasps eight?

358
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:49,846
Uh, I don't know if I'm gonna
Have time.

359
00:22:49,846 --> 00:22:51,931
Oh, all right, just bring'em by
The camper this week,

360
00:22:51,931 --> 00:22:54,767
And I'll see what I can do. I'm
Not gonna charge you.

361
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:57,270
Just bring'em by, and I'll see
What I can do.

362
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,021
I have to go. Excuse me.

363
00:22:59,021 --> 00:23:02,399
I'm here to see a Walter hobs.

364
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:03,901
I'm buddy the elf. Laughs

365
00:23:03,901 --> 00:23:07,487
You look hilarious! Who sent you?

366
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:09,489
Papa elf. Papa elf?

367
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:11,282
Mm-hmm. From the North Pole.

368
00:23:11,282 --> 00:23:12,909
From the North Pole? Yes.

369
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:14,786
So, you really think we should
Ship'em?

370
00:23:14,786 --> 00:23:18,331
No, I think we should take a
$30,000 bath

371
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:20,332
So some kid can understand
What happened?

372
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,001
To a puppy and a frigging pigeon

373
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:25,295
ship'em. Phone rings

374
00:23:25,295 --> 00:23:25,796
Yeah.

375
00:23:25,796 --> 00:23:28,507
Mr. Hobbs? It's me on the intercom.

376
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:28,965
Go ahead.

377
00:23:28,965 --> 00:23:32,552
Yeah, I think someone sent you a
Christmas-gram.

378
00:23:33,803 --> 00:23:35,263
Dad!

379
00:23:37,056 --> 00:23:38,349
Chuckles

380
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:41,060
All right, uh, let's get it
Over with.

381
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,979
I walked all day and night to
Find you.

382
00:23:43,979 --> 00:23:46,898
Uh, you look like you came from
the North Pole.

383
00:23:46,898 --> 00:23:47,441
Chuckle

384
00:23:47,441 --> 00:23:49,568
That's exactly where I came from.

385
00:23:49,568 --> 00:23:51,778
Santa must've called you!

386
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:52,904
Oh, yeah, sure, he, uh...

387
00:23:52,904 --> 00:23:54,822
Just got off the cell phone
with me.

388
00:23:54,822 --> 00:23:56,115
You did?!

389
00:23:56,115 --> 00:23:58,576
So, go on. Go on with what?

390
00:23:58,576 --> 00:24:00,828
Well, are... are you gonna sing a
Song or something,

391
00:24:00,828 --> 00:24:02,579
Or can I just go back to work?

392
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:05,499
A song? Uh...

393
00:24:05,499 --> 00:24:10,295
Yeah. Anything for you, dad, uh...

394
00:24:10,295 --> 00:24:16,300
I... I'm, I'm here with my dad

395
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,093
And we never met

396
00:24:17,093 --> 00:24:20,930
And he wants me to sing
Him a song

397
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,473
And, um, I was adopted

398
00:24:22,473 --> 00:24:24,850
But you didn't know I was born

399
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:29,312
So, I'm here now, I found you,
Daddy

400
00:24:29,312 --> 00:24:31,606
And, guess what? I love you

401
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:35,401
I love you I love you!

402
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:38,654
Wow, that was weird.

403
00:24:38,654 --> 00:24:41,574
You know, usually you guys just
Uh, you know,

404
00:24:41,574 --> 00:24:44,326
Put my name into jingle bells or
something.

405
00:24:44,326 --> 00:24:45,118
It's me, your son.

406
00:24:45,118 --> 00:24:48,371
Susan wells had me, and... And she
Didn't tell you,

407
00:24:48,371 --> 00:24:50,874
And, and, and, but now I'm here...

408
00:24:50,874 --> 00:24:52,167
It's me buddy.

409
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:53,334
Susan wells.

410
00:24:53,334 --> 00:24:56,629
Uh, you said Susan wells? Yes.

411
00:24:57,046 --> 00:24:58,923
Who sent this Christmas-gram?

412
00:24:58,923 --> 00:25:01,091
What's a Christmas-gram?
I want one.

413
00:25:01,091 --> 00:25:03,635
Whispering I think we
should call security.

414
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:04,511
Good idea.

415
00:25:04,511 --> 00:25:05,929
I like to whisper, too.

416
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:08,974
It's okay, Walter's my father.

417
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,850
Well, your dad's busy right now.

418
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,102
Okay, I'll come back later.

419
00:25:12,102 --> 00:25:13,603
Yeah, you know, you're not gonna

420
00:25:13,603 --> 00:25:14,687
Come back for awhile, okay?

421
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:16,647
You're gonna go back to
Santa land.

422
00:25:16,647 --> 00:25:17,148
Okay.

423
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:20,401
Yeah, why don't you go back?
to gimbals'?

424
00:25:28,658 --> 00:25:31,411
(Sleigh ride playing

425
00:25:38,584 --> 00:25:41,170
Sorry! Sorry.

426
00:25:53,473 --> 00:25:55,141
Passion fruit spray?

427
00:25:55,141 --> 00:25:58,185
Fruit spray? Sure.

428
00:26:00,062 --> 00:26:02,439
Crying

429
00:26:14,951 --> 00:26:16,577
Sorry.

430
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:20,706
Sorry.

431
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,004
Do you wanna go?

432
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:41,267
Toilet flushes

433
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,977
Hey! Have you seen these?
toilets?

434
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,647
They're gl-normous!

435
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,525
"For that special someone."

436
00:26:53,736 --> 00:26:55,571
Past!

437
00:26:55,571 --> 00:26:56,531
Grunts

438
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,116
Hey, come... come here!

439
00:26:59,116 --> 00:27:01,994
Me? Yes.

440
00:27:04,455 --> 00:27:06,748
What are you doing down here?

441
00:27:06,748 --> 00:27:09,543
You're not supposed to be
Down here!

442
00:27:09,543 --> 00:27:10,752
You can shop on your break,

443
00:27:10,752 --> 00:27:12,629
You don't... come on, get upstairs!

444
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:15,465
Okay, I didn't know. Well
You should know!

445
00:27:15,465 --> 00:27:16,507
Are you mad at me? No.

446
00:27:16,507 --> 00:27:18,092
Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure.

447
00:27:18,092 --> 00:27:19,218
Just do your job.

448
00:27:19,218 --> 00:27:20,761
Okay, fair enough.

449
00:27:20,761 --> 00:27:23,055
Gasps wow!

450
00:27:23,055 --> 00:27:24,223
What's this?

451
00:27:24,223 --> 00:27:25,515
This is the North Pole.

452
00:27:25,515 --> 00:27:27,601
No, it's not. Yes, it is.

453
00:27:27,601 --> 00:27:29,102
No, it's not. Yes, it is.

454
00:27:29,102 --> 00:27:30,645
No, it isn't. Yes, it is.

455
00:27:30,645 --> 00:27:32,230
No, it isn't. Yes, it is.

456
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:35,149
No, it's not. Where's the snow?

457
00:27:35,733 --> 00:27:36,692
Why you smiling like that?

458
00:27:36,692 --> 00:27:39,236
I just like to smile, smiling's
my favorite.

459
00:27:39,236 --> 00:27:41,989
Make work your favorite, that's
Your favorite, okay?

460
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:43,824
Okay. Work is your new favorite.

461
00:27:43,824 --> 00:27:44,491
Fine.

462
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:46,243
It's time for the announcement.

463
00:27:46,243 --> 00:27:46,743
Okay.

464
00:27:46,743 --> 00:27:49,788
Okay, people, tomorrow
morning 10 a.m.,

465
00:27:49,788 --> 00:27:51,289
Santa's coming' to town!

466
00:27:51,289 --> 00:27:52,790
Santa!!!

467
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,250
Oh, my god!!!

468
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:58,671
Santa here?! I know him.

469
00:27:58,671 --> 00:27:59,547
I know him.

470
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:01,006
He'll be here to take pictures

471
00:28:01,006 --> 00:28:02,508
With all the children.

472
00:28:02,508 --> 00:28:03,008
Yeah!

473
00:28:03,008 --> 00:28:05,636
Just keep your receipts.
10 a.m. Tomorrow.

474
00:28:05,636 --> 00:28:06,637
10 a.m. Tomorrow.

475
00:28:06,637 --> 00:28:07,763
Santa's coming to town.

476
00:28:07,763 --> 00:28:09,806
Yes. Can you sign this for me?

477
00:28:09,806 --> 00:28:12,559
Ohh! Hi.

478
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,520
Whispers Santa's coming.

479
00:28:34,203 --> 00:28:35,371
Are you enjoying the view?

480
00:28:35,371 --> 00:28:38,624
You are very good at decorating
that tree.

481
00:28:38,624 --> 00:28:40,668
Why are you messing with me?

482
00:28:40,668 --> 00:28:42,628
Did krumpet put you up to this?

483
00:28:42,628 --> 00:28:44,088
I'm not messing with you.

484
00:28:44,088 --> 00:28:46,048
It's just nice to meet
Another human

485
00:28:46,048 --> 00:28:48,049
Who shares my affinity for?
elf culture.

486
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:51,094
I'm just trying to get
through the holidays.

487
00:28:51,094 --> 00:28:51,553
Get through?

488
00:28:51,553 --> 00:28:55,098
Christmas is the greatest
Day in the whole wide world!

489
00:28:55,098 --> 00:28:56,224
Please stop talking to me.

490
00:28:56,224 --> 00:28:58,100
Uh-oh. Sounds like someone

491
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,269
Needs to sing a Christmas
Carol.

492
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:00,811
Go away.

493
00:29:00,811 --> 00:29:02,604
The best way to
Spread Christmas cheer

494
00:29:02,604 --> 00:29:04,273
Is singing loud for all to hear.

495
00:29:04,273 --> 00:29:05,399
Thanks, but I don't sing.

496
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:07,859
Oh, it's easy, it's just like
Talking...

497
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:08,819
Except louder and longer

498
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:10,070
And you move your voice up
And down.

499
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,822
I can sing, but I just choose not
to sing.

500
00:29:12,822 --> 00:29:15,825
Especially in front of other
people.

501
00:29:15,825 --> 00:29:17,159
Well, if you sing alone,
You can sing

502
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:18,786
In front of other people. There's
no difference.

503
00:29:18,786 --> 00:29:21,330
Actually, there's a big difference.

504
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,290
No, there... no, there isn't.

505
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,750
Wait.

506
00:29:25,751 --> 00:29:26,585
I'm singing

507
00:29:26,585 --> 00:29:30,130
I'm in a store, and I'm singing

508
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:33,299
I'm in a store, and I'm singing

509
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:36,719
Hey! There's no singing in the
North Pole.

510
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:37,762
Yes, there is.

511
00:29:37,762 --> 00:29:39,346
No, there's not.

512
00:29:39,346 --> 00:29:41,765
We sing all the time.
No, there's not.

513
00:29:41,765 --> 00:29:44,393
Especially when we make toys.

514
00:29:44,393 --> 00:29:45,143
See?

We'll be closing in ten minutes.

518
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:55,611
Well, it's time for me to go home.

519

But... but Santa's coming,
There's so much to do.

Yeah, um... laughs

(Nutcracker suite playing

Hey, uh... I'm gonna eat in the
bedroom, okay?

527
00:31:11,681 --> 00:31:12,807
I, uh, I got

528
00:31:12,807 --> 00:31:14,517
A bunch of stuff to go over.

529
00:31:14,517 --> 00:31:16,853
Are you sure? I'm... I'm just way
Behind

On a bunch of stuff.

Okay.

532
00:31:23,525 --> 00:31:25,194
Can I eat in my room?

533
00:31:25,194 --> 00:31:26,737
No. Why not?

534
00:31:26,737 --> 00:31:27,779
Dad's eating in his room.

535
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:30,282
Imitating father I got a bunch
Of homework to go over,

536
00:31:30,282 --> 00:31:32,534
And I'm way behind on a bunch
of stuff.

537

You're eating here.

538

Jovie: I really can't stay

539
00:32:11,861 --> 00:32:14,989
I've got to go 'way

540
00:32:14,989 --> 00:32:18,951
This evening has been

541
00:32:18,951 --> 00:32:22,454
So very nice

542
00:32:22,454 --> 00:32:26,500
My mother will start to worry

543
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:31,046
And father will be pacing'
The floor

544
00:32:31,046 --> 00:32:35,341
So, really, I'd better scurry

545
00:32:35,341 --> 00:32:40,262
Well, may be just a half a drink
More

546
00:32:40,262 --> 00:32:44,808
The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there

547
00:32:44,808 --> 00:32:47,102
Say, what's in this drink?

548
00:32:47,102 --> 00:32:49,813
No cabs to be had out there

549
00:32:49,813 --> 00:32:55,068
I wish I knew how to break the
Spell

550
00:32:55,068 --> 00:32:59,280
I'll take your hat, your hair
Looks swell

Mind if I move in closer?

553
00:33:03,826 --> 00:33:06,036
At least I'm gonna say that
I tried

554
00:33:06,036 --> 00:33:08,580
What's the sense of hurting?
my pride?

555

I really can't stay

Ah, but it's cold outside baby,
it's cold outside!

Water turns off

What do you wanna talk to?
Me about?

You sure it had nothing to
Do with the fact

597

That I was naked in the shower?

598

I didn't know you were naked.

599

early?

You built this? Mm-hmm.

604
00:35:36,048 --> 00:35:38,759
They're kind a pissed about
this.

605
00:35:38,759 --> 00:35:40,052
Really?

Have you seen the place?
Mm-hmm.

608
00:35:43,347 --> 00:35:46,016
It's pretty good. It's a
little too good.

No, you're not.

Well, if you're Santa...

637
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:57,582
What song did I sing for you on?
Your birthday this year?

638
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:01,168
Uh, happy birthday of course!

639

Ho ho ho ho ho!

640

Uh, so, how old are you, son?

641

Four.

your name?

get you for Christmas?

Paul... don't tell him what
You want.

645

He's a liar. Let the kid talk.

You disgust me. How can you live?
With yourself?

647
00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:19,018
Just cool it, zippy. Woman:
Smile.

648
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:20,853
You sit on a throne of lies.

649
00:37:20,853 --> 00:37:23,022
Look, I'm not kidding'.
You're a fake.

650

I'm a fake? Yes.

How'd you like to be dead, huh?

652
00:37:26,358 --> 00:37:29,361
Fake. No, he's kidding.

653

You stink.

654
00:37:29,903 --> 00:37:32,238
I think you're gonna have a good
Christmas, all right?

655
00:37:32,238 --> 00:37:33,615
You smell like beef and cheese.

656
00:37:33,615 --> 00:37:35,616
You don't smell like Santa.

657
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,909
Okay.

658
00:37:36,909 --> 00:37:38,494
Gasps kids screaming

659
00:37:38,494 --> 00:37:41,455
He's an imposter! He's not
Santa!

660
00:37:42,164 --> 00:37:46,418
He's a fake! He's a fake!
Come here. Come here!

661
00:37:46,418 --> 00:37:47,878
I saw!

662
00:37:49,713 --> 00:37:51,423
He's a fake!

663
00:37:57,053 --> 00:38:00,473
Ha ha! Where you going now?
Where you going...?

664
00:38:01,181 --> 00:38:02,599
Cheering

665
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:05,727
Manager: Ohh! Ohh!

666
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,565
No!

667
00:38:11,399 --> 00:38:13,568
Grunting

668
00:38:13,568 --> 00:38:16,946
He's not Santa Claus!

669
00:38:16,946 --> 00:38:18,739
He's not Santa!

670
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,701
"To someone special."

671
00:38:49,476 --> 00:38:51,644
What's that? Intercom.

672
00:38:51,644 --> 00:38:53,730
All right.

673
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:56,190
Phone rings

674
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,444
Yeah? Mr. Hobbs, the police are
On line one.

675
00:39:00,444 --> 00:39:03,238
Police. Hello?

676
00:39:03,238 --> 00:39:05,657
Chatter

677
00:39:21,714 --> 00:39:22,464
Dad!

678
00:39:22,464 --> 00:39:24,716
I knew that you'd come,
I love you for coming.

679
00:39:24,716 --> 00:39:26,718
Officer tom, this is my dad.

680
00:39:26,718 --> 00:39:27,803
This is Walter... he came.

681
00:39:27,803 --> 00:39:28,637
He bailed me out.

682
00:39:28,637 --> 00:39:30,013
They gave me one phone call.

683
00:39:30,013 --> 00:39:31,056
They gave me one phone call,

684
00:39:31,056 --> 00:39:33,516
And I said," I know who
I'm gonna call...

685
00:39:33,516 --> 00:39:34,225
Walter Hobbs."

686
00:39:34,225 --> 00:39:35,226
And sure enough, you showed up.

687
00:39:35,226 --> 00:39:36,727
You did, they said you weren't
goanna show up.

688
00:39:36,727 --> 00:39:39,230
They told me so many times...
shh shh shh shh shh.

689
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:42,524
Just who the heck are you,
And what is your problem?

690
00:39:42,524 --> 00:39:44,651
L-I'm buddy, I'm your son.

691
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:45,777
Wait, um...

692
00:39:45,777 --> 00:39:48,029
Tell me, tell me, tell me, uh...

693
00:39:48,029 --> 00:39:49,489
Where'd you get this picture?

694
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:52,075
Papa elf gave it to me.

695
00:39:52,992 --> 00:39:54,994
Listen... is this some kind a
game?

696
00:39:54,994 --> 00:39:56,204
What do you want, some money?

697
00:39:56,204 --> 00:39:58,080
No! I just wanted to meet you,

698
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,292
And I thought you might Anna
Meet me.

699
00:40:06,296 --> 00:40:08,548
Who wouldn't Anna meet you?

700
00:40:08,632 --> 00:40:10,759
I thought maybe we could make
Gingerbread houses,

701
00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:13,595
And eat cookie dough, and go
Ice skating, and...

702
00:40:13,595 --> 00:40:15,805
And maybe even hold hands.

703
00:40:15,805 --> 00:40:17,598
Uh-huh.

704
00:40:17,598 --> 00:40:19,683
Come with me. Okay.

705
00:40:26,106 --> 00:40:30,527
Okay. What have we got here?

706
00:40:39,118 --> 00:40:41,370
Buddy, don't eat those.

707
00:40:45,582 --> 00:40:46,792
Gasps

708
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:47,834
Ohh!

709
00:40:47,834 --> 00:40:49,211
We got to really hurry up, Walter,

710
00:40:49,211 --> 00:40:51,838
'cause I'm double booked the
rest of the afternoon.

711
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:52,380
Am I sick?

712
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,631
Yeah, but that's not why we're
Here.

713
00:40:53,631 --> 00:40:54,632
We're here to do a test, come on.

714
00:40:54,632 --> 00:40:55,716
What kind test? Just a test to
Find out

715
00:40:55,716 --> 00:40:57,843
If you're my son or not. Why am
I sitting on paper?

716
00:40:57,843 --> 00:41:00,054
Because it's sanitary for the
other patients.

717
00:41:00,054 --> 00:41:01,847
Now, sit still so I can do
the finger prick.

718
00:41:01,847 --> 00:41:03,682
Gasps finger prick!

719
00:41:03,682 --> 00:41:05,058
Ohh! It's cold.

720
00:41:05,058 --> 00:41:06,101
Yeah, just pleases it still,
Please?

721
00:41:06,101 --> 00:41:07,144
Okay, can I listen to your
necklace?

722
00:41:07,144 --> 00:41:08,728
No, you can't. Will you
Just sit still...

723
00:41:08,728 --> 00:41:09,771
Why is there a skeleton?
over there?

724
00:41:09,771 --> 00:41:11,147
I don't know, Walter,
Could you please...?

725
00:41:11,147 --> 00:41:12,148
If I squint it looks like a
pirate flag.

726
00:41:12,148 --> 00:41:13,191
Could you please have him?
Sit still?

727
00:41:13,191 --> 00:41:14,651
Does he have a name? No,
He hasn't got a name.

728
00:41:14,651 --> 00:41:15,651
I'm sorry, Ben, I am sorry.

729
00:41:15,651 --> 00:41:16,611
I have a lot of patients
waiting.

730
00:41:16,611 --> 00:41:17,695
Would you please it still?
Please.

731
00:41:17,695 --> 00:41:19,822
He got mad at me. Yes, he did.
He did.

732
00:41:19,822 --> 00:41:22,116
The sooner you sit still,
The sooner we can

733
00:41:22,116 --> 00:41:22,866
Get this mess over with.

734
00:41:22,866 --> 00:41:24,576
Okay. Then can we eat sugar
plums?

735
00:41:24,576 --> 00:41:25,786
You betcha... we'll eat sugar
Plums,

736
00:41:25,786 --> 00:41:28,705
Have gingerbread houses,
And we'll even paint eggs.

737
00:41:28,705 --> 00:41:31,124
Well, paint eggs, that's Easter.

738
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:35,169
Ow!!! Ohh...

739
00:41:35,169 --> 00:41:37,296
My finger has a heartbeat.

740
00:41:37,296 --> 00:41:40,090
It won't hurt so much after
a little.

741
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,884
What's your name?

742
00:41:41,884 --> 00:41:43,594
Buddy.

743
00:41:43,594 --> 00:41:45,178
I'm Carolyn.

744
00:41:45,178 --> 00:41:46,638
Hi.

745
00:41:47,097 --> 00:41:48,807
What do you want for Christmas?

746
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:49,891
A Suzy-talks-a-lot.

747
00:41:49,891 --> 00:41:52,644
I'll put in a good word with
the big man.

748
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,604
Thanks. Your costume is pretty.

749
00:41:54,604 --> 00:41:57,898
Oh, it's not a costume.
I'm an elf.

750
00:41:57,898 --> 00:41:59,817
Well, technically, I'm a human,

751
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,318
But I was raised by elves.

752
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:04,696
Oh, I'm a human raised by humans.

753
00:42:04,696 --> 00:42:07,324
Hmm. Cool.

754
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:14,664
Door opens so?

755
00:42:16,249 --> 00:42:19,460
It's a boy... buddy's your son.

756
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,128
That's very impossible.

757
00:42:21,128 --> 00:42:22,379
You... you saw that guy out there.

758
00:42:22,379 --> 00:42:24,339
He's... he's certifiably insane.

759
00:42:24,339 --> 00:42:25,716
He's probably just reverting

760
00:42:25,716 --> 00:42:28,301
To a state of childlike
dependency.

761
00:42:28,301 --> 00:42:29,302
An elf?

762
00:42:29,302 --> 00:42:31,346
What he needs is to be nurtured.

763
00:42:31,346 --> 00:42:33,348
Oh, I see.

764
00:42:33,348 --> 00:42:35,349
So, um, uh...

765
00:42:35,349 --> 00:42:37,310
You'd like me to breastfeed him?

766
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:38,728
Walter, just bring him home.

767
00:42:38,728 --> 00:42:39,895
Introduce him to Emily and
Michael,

768
00:42:39,895 --> 00:42:42,147
And once... once he comes to
Terms with reality,

769
00:42:42,147 --> 00:42:45,275
He should drop the whole elf
Thing and move on with his life.

770
00:42:45,275 --> 00:42:47,778
I mean, that's what I would do if
I was you.

771
00:42:47,778 --> 00:42:51,364
Oh, my god! Walter, this is...

772
00:42:51,364 --> 00:42:52,699
This is wonderful,

773
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:55,451
You... you have another son.

774
00:42:55,451 --> 00:42:56,410
Wonderful. Oh, gosh, I...

775
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:59,205
I guess I never really thought
of it that way.

776
00:42:59,205 --> 00:43:00,664
This is incredible, I...

777
00:43:00,664 --> 00:43:02,875
You know, it's a little
complicated,

778
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:05,168
But it's nothing that we can't
handle.

779
00:43:05,168 --> 00:43:07,671
Honey? What?

780
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:10,674
He thinks he's an elf.

781
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:11,800
I'm sorry, what?

782
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,469
He thinks she's a Christmas elf.

783
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:15,219
Oh, come on, Walter,

784
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:19,390
I’m sure he doesn’t actually
think he’s an elf.

785
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:22,810
And then, I traveled through
the seven levels

786
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:24,353
Of the candy cane forest,

787
00:43:24,353 --> 00:43:28,523
Past the sea of swirly-twirly
gumdrops,

788
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:34,195
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel.

789
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:53,421
Ahh.

790
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:58,551
So, where were you for the
last 30 years?

791
00:43:58,551 --> 00:43:59,468
The north pole.

792
00:43:59,468 --> 00:44:01,220
Can you pass the maple syrup?
Please?

793
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:04,848
I... I didn't put... it's
spaghetti.

794
00:44:04,848 --> 00:44:09,894
Oh, you know what? I think
I have some.

795
00:44:09,894 --> 00:44:11,312
Yes.

796
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,232
You like sugar, huh?

797
00:44:14,232 --> 00:44:15,817
Is there sugar in syrup?

798
00:44:15,817 --> 00:44:16,984
Yes.

799
00:44:16,984 --> 00:44:18,277
Then yes.

800
00:44:18,277 --> 00:44:20,779
We elves try to stick to the
four main food groups

801
00:44:20,779 --> 00:44:26,868
Candy, candy canes, candy corns,
and syrup.

802
00:44:26,868 --> 00:44:30,538
So, will you be staying with us?
Then?

803
00:44:30,538 --> 00:44:31,748
You mean I can stay?

804
00:44:31,748 --> 00:44:33,291
Of course you can. Emily.

805
00:44:33,291 --> 00:44:35,793
How... how long do you think
you'll be with us?

806
00:44:35,793 --> 00:44:37,420
I... I hadn't really planned
it out,

807
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,756
But I was thinking, like...
forever.

808
00:44:40,756 --> 00:44:43,509
Emily? Can I just speak to you
for a minute

809
00:44:43,509 --> 00:44:46,303
in the, uh, kitchen, please?

810
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:50,598
Are you crazy? He cannot
stay here.

811
00:44:50,598 --> 00:44:53,268
Clearly he has some serious issues.

812
00:44:53,268 --> 00:44:55,520
We can't just throw him out in
the snow.

813
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,355
Why not? He loves the snow.

814
00:44:57,355 --> 00:44:58,856
He's told me 15 times.

815
00:44:58,856 --> 00:45:01,442
Walter, he's your son.

816
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:04,778
Belching

817
00:45:15,329 --> 00:45:16,998
Did you hear that?

818
00:45:18,332 --> 00:45:21,001
You are so weird.

819
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,338
Dad?

820
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,092
Dad?

821
00:45:29,968 --> 00:45:32,345
Dad! Door opens

822
00:45:33,054 --> 00:45:34,180
What?

823
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,973
Whispering I can't go to sleep

824
00:45:35,973 --> 00:45:38,142
Unless I get tucked in.

825
00:45:38,142 --> 00:45:39,393
What?

826
00:45:39,393 --> 00:45:43,355
I can't go to sleep unless I
get tucked in.

827
00:45:43,647 --> 00:45:45,566
I am not gonna tuck you in.

828
00:45:45,566 --> 00:45:48,985
I... I promise I’ll go right
to sleep.

829
00:45:51,154 --> 00:45:52,614
Fine.

830
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:01,997
Tickle fight, tickle fight!
buddy, stop.

831
00:46:01,997 --> 00:46:04,416
Tickle fight. Tickle... stop
stop, stop.

832
00:46:04,416 --> 00:46:06,001
Sorry.

833
00:46:06,835 --> 00:46:08,044
It's all right.

834
00:46:08,044 --> 00:46:08,962
Hey, uh...

835
00:46:08,962 --> 00:46:09,588
Clears throat

836
00:46:09,588 --> 00:46:12,048
You just lay there and go to
sleep.

837
00:46:12,048 --> 00:46:13,091
Okay.

838
00:46:13,091 --> 00:46:14,634
Okay.

839
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:19,346
Dad? Hmm?

840
00:46:19,346 --> 00:46:21,348
I love you.

841
00:46:23,892 --> 00:46:27,437
Okay. Go to sleep now.

842
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,192
Well, this is really something.

843
00:46:33,192 --> 00:46:37,530
I'm usually the one making
breakfast.

844
00:46:38,531 --> 00:46:41,533
That's good, that's good.

845
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:44,536
Okay.

846
00:46:51,668 --> 00:46:53,378
Oh, that's good.

847
00:46:53,378 --> 00:46:55,129
Good? Good.

848
00:46:55,129 --> 00:46:56,464
Good.

849
00:46:56,464 --> 00:46:59,425
So, did you, um...

850
00:46:59,425 --> 00:47:01,135
Did you sleep okay last night?

851
00:47:01,135 --> 00:47:02,636
Great. I got a full 40 minutes.

852
00:47:02,636 --> 00:47:05,931
And I had time to build that
rocking horse.

853
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:10,143
Uh, oh, my gosh. You actually
made that?

854
00:47:10,143 --> 00:47:12,937
Where did you get all the wood?

855
00:47:22,654 --> 00:47:24,990
Good morning, honey. Good
morning, dad.

856
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:28,451
Walter, buddy has made us
breakfast.

857
00:47:28,451 --> 00:47:30,412
Isn’t that nice? Grunts

858
00:47:30,412 --> 00:47:31,913
And lunch.

859
00:47:31,913 --> 00:47:33,998
And lunch.

860
00:47:33,998 --> 00:47:35,041
Emily: Bye.

861
00:47:35,041 --> 00:47:36,000
So, dad, how many scoops?

862
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,961
I'll stick with the coffee now,
thanks.

863
00:47:41,171 --> 00:47:42,047
So, dad...

864
00:47:42,047 --> 00:47:43,757
I planned out our whole day.

865
00:47:43,757 --> 00:47:44,967
First, we'll make snow angels
for two hours,

866
00:47:44,967 --> 00:47:47,594
And then we'll go ice skating
and then we'll eat a
whole roll

867
00:47:47,594 --> 00:47:49,679
Of tollhouse cookie dough as fast
as we can,

868
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:52,015
And then, to finish, we'll snuggle.

869
00:47:52,015 --> 00:47:54,684
I've got to go to work, buddy.

870
00:47:54,684 --> 00:47:55,935
Oh, and another thing...

871
00:47:55,935 --> 00:47:57,603
If you're going to be staying
here,

872
00:47:57,603 --> 00:47:59,522
You should think about, you know,

873
00:47:59,522 --> 00:48:01,232
Getting rid of the costume.

874
00:48:01,232 --> 00:48:02,608
But I've worn this my whole life.

875
00:48:02,608 --> 00:48:05,736
You're not in the North Pole any
longer.

876
00:48:05,736 --> 00:48:08,029
You wanna make me happy, don’t you?

877
00:48:08,029 --> 00:48:08,697
More than anything.

878
00:48:08,697 --> 00:48:13,534
Then, lose the tights. I mean,
as soon as possible.

879
00:48:13,534 --> 00:48:14,786
As soon as possible?

880
00:48:14,786 --> 00:48:16,746
As soon as possible.

881
00:48:16,746 --> 00:48:18,164
Okay.

882
00:48:19,957 --> 00:48:21,166
Emily: I almost forgot...

883
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:23,043
Aah! Aah!

884
00:48:26,004 --> 00:48:27,672
Good morning.

885
00:48:28,256 --> 00:48:30,550
Cell phone rings

886
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:32,177
Ring

887
00:48:32,177 --> 00:48:32,760
Walter here.

888
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,054
Gasps it worked, it's you.

889
00:48:35,054 --> 00:48:36,514
How'd you get this number?

890
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:39,058
Emily left an emergency list.

891
00:48:39,058 --> 00:48:39,683
I see.

892
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:41,310
And, uh, is this an emergency?

893
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:42,519
There's a horrible noise

894
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:45,522
Coming from the evil
box underneath the window.

895
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:46,815
It sounds like this...

896
00:48:46,815 --> 00:48:50,485
Screeches and wails

897
00:48:50,485 --> 00:48:53,321
It’s, uh, it's... it's not evil,
buddy,

898
00:48:53,321 --> 00:48:54,489
It’s, uh, it's a radiator,

899
00:48:54,489 --> 00:48:56,324
And the heat makes noise when
it comes on.

900
00:48:56,324 --> 00:48:59,118
No, it doesn't. It... It’s very
evil.

901
00:48:59,118 --> 00:49:02,705
It's scary to look at. It's...
okay...

902
00:49:02,705 --> 00:49:06,792
I’m going toward... oh, wait.
Yes, it is.

903
00:49:06,792 --> 00:49:08,502
Okay, it's okay. It's okay.

904
00:49:08,502 --> 00:49:09,628
Everything's fine.

905
00:49:09,628 --> 00:49:10,295
You were right.

906
00:49:10,295 --> 00:49:12,797
Okay, good, uh, I’m gonna hang
up now.

907
00:49:12,797 --> 00:49:13,673
I love you.

908
00:49:13,673 --> 00:49:15,258
I'll call you in five minutes.

909
00:49:15,258 --> 00:49:17,051
No, no, buddy, don't, uh...

910
00:49:17,051 --> 00:49:19,595
You... you don’t have to call me
, okay?

911
00:49:19,595 --> 00:49:21,180
Good idea, you call me.

912
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:23,015
Okay. I'm gonna hang up now.

913
00:49:23,015 --> 00:49:24,850
I painted a picture of a
butterfly.

914
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:27,144
Good. I'm gonna hang up now.

915
00:49:27,144 --> 00:49:29,020
I tuned the piano.

916
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,606
Okay, I love you. Bye.

917
00:49:31,606 --> 00:49:33,608
Mmm...

918
00:49:33,608 --> 00:49:35,193
Mmm... Mmm.

919
00:49:49,706 --> 00:49:51,749
Mmm.

920
00:49:51,749 --> 00:49:52,709
Sighs

921
00:49:52,709 --> 00:49:55,545
Hobbs. Hey!

922
00:49:55,795 --> 00:49:57,296
How you doing? Please, sit
down.

923
00:49:57,296 --> 00:49:59,590
I haven't seen you since
the retreat.

924
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:00,549
You're looking good.

925
00:50:00,549 --> 00:50:02,134
Oh, thank you very much.
You as well.

926
00:50:02,134 --> 00:50:03,385
To what do I owe the, uh,
pleasure?

927
00:50:03,385 --> 00:50:06,763
Well, to be honest, I got a call
from my niece.

928
00:50:07,806 --> 00:50:08,640
She wants to know

929
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,393
How a certain puppy and a
certain pigeon

930
00:50:11,393 --> 00:50:16,105
Escape the clutches of a
certain evil witch.

931
00:50:17,607 --> 00:50:18,232
Believe me, uh,

932
00:50:18,232 --> 00:50:19,775
We’re already looking for new
printers.

933
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,360
This one has obviously gotten a
little sloppy.

934
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,863
Maybe it isn’t the printer who’s
gotten sloppy.

935
00:50:24,863 --> 00:50:27,115
That's your signature, right?

936
00:50:27,115 --> 00:50:30,118
You know, we could sit here and
point fingers all day.

937
00:50:30,118 --> 00:50:31,661
I've got news for you...

938
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:34,163
Even if those two pages were
in there,

939
00:50:34,163 --> 00:50:35,665
The book still would have sucked.

940
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:37,375
Have you seen the numbers for
this quarter?

941
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:40,211
Uh, they'll be here today. Oh,
they're in.

942
00:50:40,211 --> 00:50:42,129
That frigging puppy and pigeon

943
00:50:42,129 --> 00:50:43,380
Are tanking hard, Hobbs.

944
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,340
My people estimate we’re
gonna post

945
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:47,175
A minus eight for this quarter.

946
00:50:47,175 --> 00:50:50,387
A minus eight! That does not
happen!

947
00:50:50,387 --> 00:50:52,847
You know, we'll... we'll bounce
back, we...

948
00:50:52,847 --> 00:50:54,307
No, no, no. No? Well...

949
00:50:54,307 --> 00:50:56,392
We’re gonna ship a new book

950
00:50:56,392 --> 00:50:57,643
The first quarter.

951
00:50:57,643 --> 00:50:59,186
First quarter?

952
00:50:59,186 --> 00:51:01,647
I'm gonna be back in town on
the 24th.

953
00:51:01,647 --> 00:51:04,399
At that time, I would love
to hear

954
00:51:04,399 --> 00:51:06,193
In exact detail

955
00:51:06,193 --> 00:51:09,404
What your plans are for this
new book.

956
00:51:09,613 --> 00:51:13,324
Uh, wait a minute, the, uh
the 24th, that's Christmas
eve.

957
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:16,160
And?

958
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,120
And, uh...

959
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,165
No problem. Be great to have
you in the loop.

960
00:51:21,165 --> 00:51:24,126
School bell rings

961
00:51:24,251 --> 00:51:27,295
Michael: All right, I got every
weapon in the game.

962
00:51:27,295 --> 00:51:29,798
I got full health, I got full
armor.

963
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:30,674
Michael!

964
00:51:30,674 --> 00:51:31,800
I got full...

965
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,967
Michael!

966
00:51:32,967 --> 00:51:34,927
It's me buddy!

967
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,429
You know that guy?

968
00:51:36,429 --> 00:51:38,931
No, I’ve never seen him before.

969
00:51:38,931 --> 00:51:42,393
It's me buddy! Your brother!

970
00:51:42,393 --> 00:51:43,769
Oh, man.

971
00:51:43,769 --> 00:51:48,398
No, Michael! Wait! It's your
brother bud...

972
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:49,316
Tires screech

973
00:51:49,316 --> 00:51:51,943
Sorry. Sorry! Horn honks

974
00:51:52,652 --> 00:51:55,321
Michael! Michael!

975
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:57,156
Michael!

976
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:58,783
Michael, wait up!

977
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:01,827
Michael! Michael!

978
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:02,661
Wow, you're fast.

979
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,329
I'm glad I caught up with you.

980
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,373
I waited five hours for you.

981
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,707
Why is your coat so big?

982
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:10,168
So, good news... I saw a dog
today.

983
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,670
Have you seen a dog?
You probably have.

984
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:14,422
How was school? Was it fun?

985
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,299
Did you get a lot of
homework, huh?

986
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,466
Do you have any friends?

987
00:52:17,466 --> 00:52:18,801
Do you have a best friend?

988
00:52:18,801 --> 00:52:20,511
Does he have a big coat, too?

989
00:52:20,511 --> 00:52:21,971
Go away!

990
00:52:23,347 --> 00:52:27,476
Ow! Son of a nutcracker!

991
00:52:30,312 --> 00:52:31,729
Run!

992
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:35,691
Boy: Get him! Get the
green guy!

993
00:52:35,691 --> 00:52:38,194
Boys cheering

994
00:52:42,698 --> 00:52:45,450
Oh, no. These guys are bad news.

995
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:48,036
We better get outta here.

996
00:52:49,329 --> 00:52:51,873
You know what? We can take'em.

997
00:52:51,873 --> 00:52:55,877
Okay, just start making as
many snowballs as you can.

998
00:53:02,966 --> 00:53:05,385
Grunts you ready?

999
00:53:06,303 --> 00:53:09,097
Let's go. Aah! Ow.

1000
00:53:10,307 --> 00:53:11,724
Ow!

1001
00:53:16,562 --> 00:53:18,439
Boy: Run!

1002
00:53:24,486 --> 00:53:26,071
Crying

1003
00:53:26,446 --> 00:53:29,241
Michael: Oh, man. One got away.

1004
00:53:29,241 --> 00:53:30,533
Snowball.

1005
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:40,543
Kid: Unh!

1006
00:53:41,335 --> 00:53:42,795
Wow.

1007
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,256
Where did you say you were from?

1008
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:48,508
Oh, yeah

1009
00:53:48,508 --> 00:53:51,261
Candles burning low

1010
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:53,930
Lots of mistletoe

1011
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:59,769
Lots of snow and ice everywhere
we go

1012
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:05,315
Choirs singing carols right
outside my door

1013
00:54:05,315 --> 00:54:07,567
All these things and more

1014
00:54:07,567 --> 00:54:09,277
I wish dad were here.

1015
00:54:09,277 --> 00:54:09,569
Why?

1016
00:54:09,569 --> 00:54:13,531
'Cause he's the greatest dad in
the whole wide world.

1017
00:54:13,531 --> 00:54:14,365
Are you kidding?

1018
00:54:14,365 --> 00:54:16,951
He's the worst dad in the world.

1019
00:54:16,951 --> 00:54:18,285
What do you mean?

1020
00:54:18,285 --> 00:54:20,538
All he does is work.

1021
00:54:20,538 --> 00:54:21,956
Working's fun.

1022
00:54:21,956 --> 00:54:23,999
Not the way he does it.

1023
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,042
All he cares about is money.

1024
00:54:25,042 --> 00:54:29,129
He doesn't care about you,
or me, or anybody.

1025
00:54:29,129 --> 00:54:31,965
Well, he is on the naughty list.

1026
00:54:36,594 --> 00:54:38,346
You like her?

1027
00:54:38,346 --> 00:54:40,306
Like who?

1028
00:54:40,472 --> 00:54:42,349
The girl you’re staring at.

1029
00:54:42,349 --> 00:54:44,017
Oh, uh...

1030
00:54:44,017 --> 00:54:45,852
Yeah.

1031
00:54:47,145 --> 00:54:49,314
Why don’t you ask her out?

1032
00:54:49,314 --> 00:54:50,315
Out?

1033
00:54:50,315 --> 00:54:53,401
You know, on a date...
to eat food.

1034
00:54:53,401 --> 00:54:54,319
Food?

1035
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:57,071
Yes, real food, not candy.

1036
00:54:57,071 --> 00:54:59,115
And if she says yes,
you're in.

1037
00:54:59,115 --> 00:55:02,368
It's like a secret code
girls have.

1038
00:55:03,994 --> 00:55:05,996
Well, look who it is.

1039
00:55:05,996 --> 00:55:09,124
Hi, Jovie. Hi.

1040
00:55:11,084 --> 00:55:12,877
Oh, uh, this is Michael.

1041
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:14,504
I'm his brother.

1042
00:55:15,463 --> 00:55:16,506
Hi.

1043
00:55:16,506 --> 00:55:18,341
So, what are you doing here?

1044
00:55:18,341 --> 00:55:20,634
Did gimbel's give you your
job back?

1045
00:55:20,634 --> 00:55:23,512
No. But things worked out
pretty good.

1046
00:55:23,512 --> 00:55:25,555
They gave me a restraining
order.

1047
00:55:25,681 --> 00:55:29,643
Well, um, you should probably
get outta here.

1048
00:55:29,643 --> 00:55:32,604
Ho ho ho!

1049
00:55:32,604 --> 00:55:34,856
But... I really wanted to
see you,

1050
00:55:34,856 --> 00:55:38,943
And... and I think you’re
beautiful, and I, um...

1051
00:55:38,943 --> 00:55:42,404
I feel really warm when I
am around you,

1052
00:55:42,404 --> 00:55:46,700
And, um, my tongue swells up.

1053
00:55:50,662 --> 00:55:52,914
So...

1054
00:55:53,206 --> 00:55:55,416
Do you wanna go eat food?

1055
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:58,377
Do I... do I wanna eat food?

1056
00:55:58,377 --> 00:55:59,378
Mm-hmm.

1057
00:55:59,378 --> 00:56:04,675
You know, uh, the code... food.

1058
00:56:06,426 --> 00:56:09,554
Well, I just had my lunch
break.

1059
00:56:09,929 --> 00:56:12,599
Oh, okay. I understand.

1060
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:15,560
But I’m free on Thursday.

1061
00:56:16,561 --> 00:56:18,020
Thursday! Thursday!

1062
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:20,189
Come on. That'd be great.

1063
00:56:20,189 --> 00:56:21,190
All right.

1064
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:22,983
Buddy: Was that okay?

1065
00:56:22,983 --> 00:56:25,611
You did great, man.

1066
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,487
What should we put on it
first?

1067
00:56:27,487 --> 00:56:29,155
Lights! Oh, good.

1068
00:56:29,155 --> 00:56:30,198
And then, after that?

1069
00:56:30,198 --> 00:56:33,076
Ornaments! Ornaments, okay.

1070
00:56:33,993 --> 00:56:35,578
What the hell's that?

1071
00:56:35,578 --> 00:56:37,413
Michael: A Christmas tree.

1072
00:56:37,413 --> 00:56:38,122
A Christmas tree?

1073
00:56:38,122 --> 00:56:41,250
Buddy chopped it down in
the park.

1074
00:56:42,001 --> 00:56:43,502
Emily.

1075
00:56:43,502 --> 00:56:46,088
I don't know what you're making
such a big deal about.

1076
00:56:46,088 --> 00:56:48,548
They were just having a
little fun.

1077
00:56:48,548 --> 00:56:50,133
Oh, fun? So felonies are
fun now?

1078
00:56:50,133 --> 00:56:52,927
I thought, see, felonies
were felonies.

1079
00:56:52,927 --> 00:56:53,928
Okay, the tree thing was bad.

1080
00:56:53,928 --> 00:56:55,221
I'll get him to plant
another one.

1081
00:56:55,221 --> 00:56:57,974
But at least Michael is
happy for once.

1082
00:56:57,974 --> 00:57:00,434
What, uh, what's that supposed
to mean?

1083
00:57:00,434 --> 00:57:02,561
Well, I don't think it's any
secret, Walter,

1084
00:57:02,561 --> 00:57:05,022
That you haven’t exactly been
there for him.

1085
00:57:05,022 --> 00:57:06,648
I'll tell you what, why don't
we just

1086
00:57:06,648 --> 00:57:08,942
Pull him outta school and let
the, uh,

1087
00:57:08,942 --> 00:57:10,276
Deranged elf man raise him?

1088
00:57:10,276 --> 00:57:13,112
Then they can have lots of
fun committing felonies.

1089
00:57:13,112 --> 00:57:16,199
How are we gonna get the star
on top?

1090
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:17,742
I got it.

1091
00:57:29,669 --> 00:57:30,795
I mean, what are we gonna do?

1092
00:57:30,795 --> 00:57:32,964
We can't... we can’t leave him
alone here.

1093
00:57:32,964 --> 00:57:35,466
He's gonna destroy the place.

1094
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:38,260
Why don’t you, um...

1095
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:39,595
Why don't you take off tomorrow?

1096
00:57:39,595 --> 00:57:41,805
You know, and you could stay
home and watch him?

1097
00:57:41,805 --> 00:57:44,141
Oh, no. No, I can’t stay home
tomorrow,

1098
00:57:44,141 --> 00:57:45,642
I have a budget meeting tomorrow.

1099
00:57:45,642 --> 00:57:46,810
Well, honey, I can’t take off,

1100
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:49,271
I’m one... one bad pitch away

1101
00:57:49,271 --> 00:57:50,313
From getting fired... one.

1102
00:57:50,313 --> 00:57:52,232
Well, I tell you what, I have
an idea then.

1103
00:57:52,232 --> 00:57:56,152
Why don’t you take buddy to
work with you?

1104
00:57:59,071 --> 00:58:00,865
Elevator chimes

1105
00:58:03,492 --> 00:58:05,661
Hey, Walter. Morning, jack.

1106
00:58:05,661 --> 00:58:07,329
Morning, jack.

1107
00:58:07,954 --> 00:58:08,914
Oh, good morning, Mr. Hobbs.

1108
00:58:08,914 --> 00:58:10,498
Good morning, Sarah. Good
morning, Sarah.

1109
00:58:10,498 --> 00:58:13,543
That's a nice purple dress.
It's very purple-y

1110
00:58:13,543 --> 00:58:15,044
Francisco. How's it going, Mr.
Hobbs?

1111
00:58:15,044 --> 00:58:19,131
Francisco, that's fun to say..."
Francisco."

1112
00:58:19,131 --> 00:58:20,382
Gasps

1113
00:58:20,382 --> 00:58:21,592
Hi! Hi.

1114
00:58:21,592 --> 00:58:22,551
Do you remember me?

1115
00:58:22,551 --> 00:58:23,677
I do. I didn't recognize you.

1116
00:58:23,677 --> 00:58:26,388
I know, I’m in work clothes.

1117
00:58:29,891 --> 00:58:31,893
Thank you, Deborah.

1118
00:58:31,893 --> 00:58:32,936
Thanks, deb.

1119
00:58:32,936 --> 00:58:34,145
Deb, you have such a pretty face.

1120
00:58:34,145 --> 00:58:35,688
You should be on a Christmas card.

1121
00:58:35,688 --> 00:58:38,149
You just made my day.

1122
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:47,449
Eww.

1123
00:58:50,201 --> 00:58:51,411
Buddy. Hmm?

1124
00:58:51,411 --> 00:58:53,413
You don’t have to drink that.

1125
00:58:53,413 --> 00:58:54,914
Thank you.

1126
00:59:05,048 --> 00:59:07,050
Francisco.

1127
00:59:08,176 --> 00:59:10,720
Francisco.

1128
00:59:12,013 --> 00:59:14,432
Francisco.

1129
00:59:14,432 --> 00:59:15,600
Francisco.

1130
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,059
Buddy?

1131
00:59:17,643 --> 00:59:19,395
Am I too loud?

1132
00:59:19,395 --> 00:59:20,729
Just... just a little.

1133
00:59:20,729 --> 00:59:22,439
Sorry.

1134
00:59:28,403 --> 00:59:29,029
Yes, bud?

1135
00:59:29,029 --> 00:59:31,698
Why is your name on the desk?

1136
00:59:31,698 --> 00:59:33,908
I bought the desk.

1137
00:59:33,908 --> 00:59:36,702
My name's there so no one
steals it.

1138
00:59:38,537 --> 00:59:39,997
That's a joke, isn't it, dad?

1139
00:59:39,997 --> 00:59:42,166
Yeah, buddy, that's a joke.

1140
00:59:42,166 --> 00:59:45,585
So, what are we gonna build?

1141
00:59:45,585 --> 00:59:46,962
No, uh, we don't do

1142
00:59:46,962 --> 00:59:48,672
That kind of work here, pal.

1143
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:49,923
Phone rings

1144
00:59:49,923 --> 00:59:52,175
Buddy the elf, what's your
favorite color?

1145
00:59:52,175 --> 00:59:53,593
Put that down. Hello?

1146
00:59:53,593 --> 00:59:55,970
Hello? Dial tone

1147
00:59:57,221 --> 00:59:59,723
Please, don’t touch anything.

1148
00:59:59,723 --> 01:00:01,183
Sorry.

1149
01:00:04,561 --> 01:00:06,021
Hey...

1150
01:00:07,773 --> 01:00:10,025
Bud, have you... have you...

1151
01:00:10,025 --> 01:00:11,985
Have you ever seen a mailroom?

1152
01:00:11,985 --> 01:00:13,194
A mailroom? No.

1153
01:00:13,194 --> 01:00:14,445
No? No.

1154
01:00:14,445 --> 01:00:15,279
Oh, I mean, wow.

1155
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:18,032
Wow... listen, it's a
place where mail

1156
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:19,033
From all over the world
comes,

1157
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:21,744
Uh-huh. And they sort it
out there, see?

1158
01:00:21,744 --> 01:00:22,745
And you can touch it all,

1159
01:00:22,745 --> 01:00:24,580
And they put it in these
shiny bins.

1160
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:26,123
Shiny bins? Right.

1161
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:28,625
What do ya think? It
sounds great.

1162
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,668
Good.

1163
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:31,211
Can we go there?

1164
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:32,003
Well, um...

1165
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:35,214
I gotta work here, maybe... maybe
you can work there.

1166
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:36,507
Okay, I’ll work there.

1167
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:39,051
Rap music playing

1168
01:00:39,051 --> 01:00:41,220
Oh, I don't think this is
the place

1169
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,513
My dad was talking about.

1170
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:44,056
Is there a different mailroom?

1171
01:00:44,056 --> 01:00:46,266
No. This is the only one.

1172
01:00:46,266 --> 01:00:48,518
It's not very shiny.

1173
01:00:48,602 --> 01:00:52,647
Now... over here’s the trench.

1174
01:00:52,647 --> 01:00:54,774
All the mail comes out that
shooter.

1175
01:00:54,774 --> 01:00:59,195
Scan and find the floor each
piece is moving to.

1176
01:00:59,195 --> 01:01:00,196
Put it in a canister

1177
01:01:00,196 --> 01:01:03,782
And shove it up the tube with
the same number.

1178
01:01:03,782 --> 01:01:05,659
You got that?

1179
01:01:05,659 --> 01:01:06,660
I think so.

1180
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:09,621
This place reminds me of
Santa’s workshop.

1181
01:01:09,621 --> 01:01:11,206
Except it smells like mushrooms,

1182
01:01:11,206 --> 01:01:14,208
And everyone looks like they
wanna hurt me.

1183
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,502
Uh, greenway’s coming in tomorrow,

1184
01:01:16,502 --> 01:01:18,129
So, what... what do we got?

1185
01:01:18,129 --> 01:01:20,172
Well, Morris and I have been
brainstorming,

1186
01:01:20,172 --> 01:01:22,633
And we've come up with what I
think

1187
01:01:22,633 --> 01:01:24,092
Is a pretty big idea.

1188
01:01:24,092 --> 01:01:24,593
Great, what?

1189
01:01:24,593 --> 01:01:27,137
You're gonna love it, it's
fantastic.

1190
01:01:27,137 --> 01:01:28,138
What?

1191
01:01:28,138 --> 01:01:30,849
Okay, picture this...

1192
01:01:30,849 --> 01:01:34,727
We bring in miles finch.

1193
01:01:35,645 --> 01:01:37,563
The miles finch?

1194
01:01:37,563 --> 01:01:38,814
The golden ghost.

1195
01:01:38,814 --> 01:01:39,690
We bring him in!

1196
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:42,568
He's written more classics than dr.
Seuss.

1197
01:01:42,568 --> 01:01:43,569
It ain't gonna be easy,

1198
01:01:43,569 --> 01:01:45,237
But I think it’s worth a shot.

1199
01:01:45,237 --> 01:01:49,866
My two top writers, my crack team,
my fun squad...

1200
01:01:49,866 --> 01:01:51,576
You came in here pitching me

1201
01:01:51,576 --> 01:01:54,120
The idea of hiring another writer?

1202
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,204
Yeah.

1203
01:01:55,204 --> 01:01:57,373
Miles finch.

1204
01:02:00,084 --> 01:02:02,586
I like it. Chuckles

1205
01:02:03,754 --> 01:02:04,755
I like it.

1206
01:02:04,755 --> 01:02:06,798
Then I traveled through the seven
levels

1207
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:07,799
Of the candy cane forest

1208
01:02:07,799 --> 01:02:12,095
And past the sea of swirly-twirly
gumdrops.

1209
01:02:12,095 --> 01:02:14,597
Gasps ooh!

1210
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:17,642
Wow... it's sucky.

1211
01:02:17,642 --> 01:02:20,561
Ohh, it's wonderful. Yes!

1212
01:02:20,561 --> 01:02:22,563
That is marvelous how that...

1213
01:02:22,563 --> 01:02:24,356
Oh! (Laughs

1214
01:02:24,356 --> 01:02:26,692
Oh, it's very sucky.

1215
01:02:26,692 --> 01:02:29,402
It's very... sucky.

1216
01:02:29,402 --> 01:02:30,737
Whoo.

1217
01:02:30,737 --> 01:02:32,614
So, how'd you get here?

1218
01:02:32,614 --> 01:02:34,073
Work release.

1219
01:02:34,073 --> 01:02:35,199
Mm.

1220
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:37,785
Oh, syrup and coffee?

1221
01:02:37,785 --> 01:02:41,080
Why didn't I think of that? Can I
try some?

1222
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,247
Be my guest.

1223
01:02:42,247 --> 01:02:43,749
Very generous of you.

1224
01:02:43,749 --> 01:02:48,128
Mmm. Gasps I love syrup.

1225
01:02:50,171 --> 01:02:52,340
Ohh, I love it.

1226
01:02:53,591 --> 01:02:55,593
Mmm...

1227
01:02:55,593 --> 01:02:58,387
You know, I know I sound like a
broken record,

1228
01:02:58,387 --> 01:02:59,388
But we are buddies.

1229
01:02:59,388 --> 01:03:01,640
You're my best friend, that's it.

1230
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,391
You're my best friend.

1231
01:03:02,391 --> 01:03:05,102
You know, buddy, nobody around
here listens to me.

1232
01:03:05,102 --> 01:03:07,270
I got really good ideas. Yeah?
I believe it.

1233
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:09,314
I know, I’m right, I listen to you.

1234
01:03:09,314 --> 01:03:10,273
You have great ideas.

1235
01:03:10,273 --> 01:03:12,150
I just try to go with the flow,
you know?

1236
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:13,359
Good, you go with the flow.

1237
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:14,444
Yeah. Go with the flow.

1238
01:03:14,444 --> 01:03:16,237
No, I gotta get out of the flow.

1239
01:03:16,237 --> 01:03:17,196
Well, then get out of the flow.

1240
01:03:17,196 --> 01:03:18,406
I'm in the flow, that's what got
me here.

1241
01:03:18,406 --> 01:03:21,825
I gotta... I’m 26 years old, I got
nothing to show for it.

1242
01:03:21,825 --> 01:03:23,827
You're young. You're so young.

1243
01:03:23,827 --> 01:03:24,828
Sighs

1244
01:03:24,828 --> 01:03:25,662
My papa... yeah?

1245
01:03:25,662 --> 01:03:30,291
He didn't make master tinker till
he was 490, so...

1246
01:03:30,291 --> 01:03:32,669
Laughing

1247
01:03:33,169 --> 01:03:34,879
Four-hundred and ninety? Yeah.

1248
01:03:34,879 --> 01:03:36,380
Laughing

1249
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,632
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!

1250
01:03:38,632 --> 01:03:41,385
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!

1251
01:03:41,385 --> 01:03:44,888
My favorite book of yours has
gotta be Gus' pickles.

1252
01:03:44,888 --> 01:03:48,725
It's existential, yet it's so
accessible.

1253
01:03:48,725 --> 01:03:51,311
Uh, Mr. Finch, uh, Eugene Dupris
here.

1254
01:03:51,311 --> 01:03:53,938
It's a thrill just to be talking
to you

1255
01:03:53,938 --> 01:03:55,189
On our speakerphone.

1256
01:03:55,189 --> 01:03:57,191
Miles, um, so, what do you think?

1257
01:03:57,191 --> 01:03:58,192
Can you fly in tomorrow?

1258
01:03:58,192 --> 01:04:00,444
I'll give you five hours tomorrow,

1259
01:04:00,444 --> 01:04:01,695
Not a minute more.

1260
01:04:01,695 --> 01:04:02,738
Oh, that's... that's great.

1261
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:06,408
I'd like a black s500to receive
me at the airport.

1262
01:04:06,408 --> 01:04:08,201
I need the interior of that car

1263
01:04:08,201 --> 01:04:10,203
To be 71 degrees exactly.

1264
01:04:10,203 --> 01:04:12,205
We can do that. Deborah: Mr. Hobbs?

1265
01:04:12,205 --> 01:04:13,706
There’s a situation downstairs.

1266
01:04:13,706 --> 01:04:14,916
Finch: I'm sorry, what?

1267
01:04:14,916 --> 01:04:16,167
No, hold on, miles. Deb, hang up.

1268
01:04:16,167 --> 01:04:18,336
Finch: I do not hold. Do not put
me on hold.

1269
01:04:18,336 --> 01:04:20,921
Deborah: We have a problem in the
mailroom.

1270
01:04:20,921 --> 01:04:21,839
What's going on?

1271
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:22,881
Don't speak... Deborah, hang up!

1272
01:04:22,881 --> 01:04:25,842
Finch: That's it, I’m gone. Miles!

1273
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,723
Finch: I'll be there tomorrow... 71
degrees.

1274
01:04:31,723 --> 01:04:33,891
Deborah: Sir, chuck in the mailroom

1275
01:04:33,891 --> 01:04:35,435
Needs to talk to you.

1276
01:04:35,435 --> 01:04:36,852
Chuck... what, chuck?

1277
01:04:36,852 --> 01:04:38,396
I mean, what could be going on
down there

1278
01:04:38,396 --> 01:04:40,439
That’s so important you had to
interrupt me, what?

1279
01:04:40,439 --> 01:04:42,232
Whoomp, there it is! A little
louder

1280
01:04:42,232 --> 01:04:44,234
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

1281
01:04:44,234 --> 01:04:46,194
Whoomp! There it is

1282
01:04:46,194 --> 01:04:47,696
Upside down and inside out hey!

1283
01:04:47,696 --> 01:04:48,989
I'm 'bout to show all you folks

1284
01:04:48,989 --> 01:04:50,448
What it's all about hey!

1285
01:04:50,448 --> 01:04:51,699
Time for me to get on the mike

1286
01:04:51,699 --> 01:04:53,243
And make this mother of a party
hype

1287
01:04:53,243 --> 01:04:54,827
I’m taking you back to the old
school

1288
01:04:54,827 --> 01:04:56,537
'cause I’m an old fool who’s so cool

1289
01:04:56,537 --> 01:04:58,331
If you wanna get down, I’m gonna
show you the way

1290
01:04:58,331 --> 01:05:00,457
Whoomp, there it is, let me hear
you say

1291
01:05:00,457 --> 01:05:02,751
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

1292
01:05:02,751 --> 01:05:04,753
Whoomp! There it is a little louder

1293
01:05:04,753 --> 01:05:06,755
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

1294
01:05:06,755 --> 01:05:08,423
Whoomp, there it is!

1295
01:05:08,423 --> 01:05:10,008
Door buzzer

1296
01:05:10,842 --> 01:05:11,301
Coming.

1297
01:05:11,301 --> 01:05:14,387
(You make me feel so young playing

1298
01:05:16,931 --> 01:05:18,391
Hi.

1299
01:05:18,391 --> 01:05:19,767
Wow.

1300
01:05:19,767 --> 01:05:21,518
You look miraculous.

1301
01:05:21,518 --> 01:05:23,020
So do you.

1302
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:24,229
Thank you.

1303
01:05:24,229 --> 01:05:26,231
What would you like to do?

1304
01:05:26,231 --> 01:05:28,316
I got some ideas.

1305
01:05:32,403 --> 01:05:36,324
Just reach out in front of you and
and take a sip.

1306
01:05:36,324 --> 01:05:39,785
Don't look. There you go.

1307
01:05:41,954 --> 01:05:43,413
Well?

1308
01:05:43,789 --> 01:05:46,458
It tastes like a crappy cup
of coffee.

1309
01:05:46,458 --> 01:05:48,752
Chuckles no.

1310
01:05:50,295 --> 01:05:52,046
It is a crappy cup of coffee.

1311
01:05:52,046 --> 01:05:54,549
No, it's the world’s best cup
of coffee.

1312
01:05:54,549 --> 01:05:58,302
The trick is to not get your arm caught
in the door!

1313
01:05:58,302 --> 01:06:01,805
Also, never close your eyes’ cause
then

1314
01:06:01,805 --> 01:06:05,475
Okay, when you feel comfortable, you
just jump in!

1315
01:06:05,475 --> 01:06:07,269
Laughing what are you doing?

1316
01:06:07,269 --> 01:06:11,022
I'm skipping. I'm skipping.
I'm skipping.

1317
01:06:11,022 --> 01:06:13,358
Wait, wait, wait... one more, one more.

1318
01:06:13,358 --> 01:06:16,068
Now, look at the size of this one.

1319
01:06:21,573 --> 01:06:23,450
Come with me.

1320
01:06:24,284 --> 01:06:25,410
Watch out. (Tires screech

1321
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:26,828
Yellow ones don’t stop.

1322
01:06:26,828 --> 01:06:29,497
The yellow ones don’t stop.

1323
01:06:34,961 --> 01:06:39,090
Wow... that's a big one.

1324
01:06:59,859 --> 01:07:01,360
I'm sorry.

1325
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:02,528
You missed.

1326
01:07:02,528 --> 01:07:04,488
What do you mean I missed?

1327
01:07:04,488 --> 01:07:05,989
You missed.

1328
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:17,333
Elevator chimes

1329
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:27,092
Miles finch.

1330
01:07:27,092 --> 01:07:29,052
Miles finch.

1331
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:32,889
Miles finch.

1332
01:07:35,433 --> 01:07:36,851
All right, let's do this.

1333
01:07:36,851 --> 01:07:39,186
Miles, I’m so happy you could come
Uh...

1334
01:07:39,186 --> 01:07:39,562
Yeah.

1335
01:07:39,562 --> 01:07:41,981
I'm Walter Hobbs. Yeah, let's get
the, uh...

1336
01:07:41,981 --> 01:07:44,858
Taken care of so we can get started
here.

1337
01:07:44,858 --> 01:07:46,568
Here you go.

1338
01:07:48,153 --> 01:07:49,571
Finch: Great.

1339
01:07:49,571 --> 01:07:52,031
All right... clears throat

1340
01:07:52,031 --> 01:07:54,534
What have you guys got so far?

1341
01:07:54,534 --> 01:07:56,118
Go ahead.

1342
01:07:56,118 --> 01:07:57,161
Uh...

1343
01:07:57,161 --> 01:08:00,414
We were thinking, uh, something
like this, uh...

1344
01:08:00,414 --> 01:08:02,416
We open on a young tomato.

1345
01:08:02,416 --> 01:08:04,543
He's had some tough times down
at the farm

1346
01:08:04,543 --> 01:08:06,420
With, you know, a rabbit, and...

1347
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,922
No. No tomatoes...

1348
01:08:08,922 --> 01:08:09,547
Too vulnerable.

1349
01:08:09,547 --> 01:08:11,424
Kids, they're already vulnerable.

1350
01:08:11,424 --> 01:08:12,634
No, you see? I... I told you guys.

1351
01:08:12,634 --> 01:08:14,510
I told them the very same thing...

1352
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:15,178
And no farms.

1353
01:08:15,178 --> 01:08:17,638
Every body's pushing small town
rural.

1354
01:08:17,638 --> 01:08:20,057
A farm book would just be white
noise.

1355
01:08:20,057 --> 01:08:20,933
What about this?

1356
01:08:20,933 --> 01:08:23,936
Uh, a tribe of asparagus children,

1357
01:08:23,936 --> 01:08:28,565
But they're self-conscious about
the way their pee smells.

1358
01:08:33,069 --> 01:08:35,613
Apparently, all we have is
vegetables.

1359
01:08:35,613 --> 01:08:37,114
I have no time, so, you know,

1360
01:08:37,114 --> 01:08:38,115
If you've got a story here...

1361
01:08:38,115 --> 01:08:40,951
I’ve got about five or six great
starts here.

1362
01:08:40,951 --> 01:08:42,995
I've got one idea that
I’m especially

1363
01:08:42,995 --> 01:08:45,205
Psyched out of my mind about.

1364
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:47,415
You know, it's one of those ideas

1365
01:08:47,415 --> 01:08:48,959
Where you're just like, uh...

1366
01:08:48,959 --> 01:08:49,918
Yes!

1367
01:08:49,918 --> 01:08:52,128
Whoa! Chuckling

1368
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,547
Uh, great, c-could we hear it?

1369
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:57,925
I'll start with the cover.
Picture this... you got, uh

1370
01:08:57,925 --> 01:08:59,927
Dad! I'm in love, I’m in love,

1371
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:03,430
And I don't care who knows it!

1372
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:04,139
Buddy, not now, uh,

1373
01:09:04,139 --> 01:09:06,558
Can you please go back to the...
to the pit?

1374
01:09:06,558 --> 01:09:08,727
I'll come and visit you in a
little while, okay?

1375
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:12,230
I didn't know you had elves
working here.

1376
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:17,151
Oh... boy, you're... you’re hilarious,
my friend.

1377
01:09:17,151 --> 01:09:19,445
He doesn't, uh... get back to

1378
01:09:19,445 --> 01:09:22,114
The story, please. All right, okay.

1379
01:09:22,114 --> 01:09:23,240
Clears throat

1380
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:24,741
So, on the cover above the title...

1381
01:09:24,741 --> 01:09:27,285
Does Santa know that you left the
workshop?

1382
01:09:27,285 --> 01:09:29,454
You know, we're all laughing our
heads off.

1383
01:09:29,454 --> 01:09:31,581
Did you have to borrow a reindeer
to get down here?

1384
01:09:31,581 --> 01:09:33,458
Buddy... go back to the basement.

1385
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:35,001
Finch: Hey, jack weed,

1386
01:09:35,001 --> 01:09:36,627
I get more action in a week

1387
01:09:36,627 --> 01:09:38,004
than you've had your entire life.

1388
01:09:38,004 --> 01:09:41,632
I've got houses in I.e., Paris,
and Vail,

1389
01:09:41,632 --> 01:09:43,050
Oh. Each one of them

1390
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:45,052
with a 70-inchplasma screen.

1391
01:09:45,052 --> 01:09:46,553
So, I suggest you wipe

1392
01:09:46,553 --> 01:09:47,971
That stupid smile off your face

1393
01:09:47,971 --> 01:09:50,515
Before I come over there and smack
it off!

1394
01:09:50,515 --> 01:09:52,183
You feeling strong, my friend?!

1395
01:09:52,183 --> 01:09:55,645
Call me elf one more time!

1396
01:09:59,607 --> 01:10:02,484
Whispers he's an angry elf.

1397
01:10:05,195 --> 01:10:08,073
Growling look at you.

1398
01:10:10,033 --> 01:10:11,993
Ow! Hey, what...

1399
01:10:11,993 --> 01:10:12,785
Aah!

1400
01:10:12,785 --> 01:10:14,495
I wasn't ready for that.

1401
01:10:14,495 --> 01:10:15,538
Aah! Hey, hey, hey!

1402
01:10:15,538 --> 01:10:19,041
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa!

1403
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:19,542
Ooh...

1404
01:10:19,542 --> 01:10:21,502
Call me elf one more time!

1405
01:10:21,502 --> 01:10:23,003
Call me elf!

1406
01:10:23,003 --> 01:10:25,005
You're an elf.

1407
01:10:28,049 --> 01:10:30,010
Glass shatters

1408
01:10:30,343 --> 01:10:34,055
Miles, I’m sorry, he... he thinks
he's an elf.

1409
01:10:35,014 --> 01:10:35,848
Listen, miles...

1410
01:10:35,848 --> 01:10:37,099
Listen, miles! Door slams

1411
01:10:37,099 --> 01:10:40,853
He must be a South Pole elf.

1412
01:10:43,188 --> 01:10:44,273
You get the hell outta here.

1413
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:46,566
Where do you want me to go?

1414
01:10:46,566 --> 01:10:47,526
I don't care where you go.

1415
01:10:47,526 --> 01:10:49,069
I don't care that you're an elf!

1416
01:10:49,069 --> 01:10:50,070
I don't care that you’re nuts!

1417
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:52,280
I don't care that you’re my son!

1418
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:55,241
Get out of my life now!

1419
01:11:05,667 --> 01:11:06,710
Emily: Hi, it's me.

1420
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:08,253
I really can't talk right now.

1421
01:11:08,253 --> 01:11:10,588
Well, just tell me how the pitch
went.

1422
01:11:10,588 --> 01:11:13,341
I'm gonna be a little later than
I thought, okay?

1423
01:11:13,341 --> 01:11:15,593
Well, don't be too late, Walter,

1424
01:11:15,593 --> 01:11:17,136
It’s Christmas Eve.

1425
01:11:17,136 --> 01:11:19,096
Walter... wait, um.

1426
01:11:19,096 --> 01:11:21,223
Honey, I gotta go, okay? Love ya.

1427
01:11:21,223 --> 01:11:23,392
Oh, say hi to buddy.

1428
01:11:24,268 --> 01:11:25,894
What? Walter, breakthrough.

1429
01:11:25,894 --> 01:11:28,104
We found this in the conference
room.

1430
01:11:28,104 --> 01:11:28,605
What is it?

1431
01:11:28,605 --> 01:11:30,565
It's miles finch’s notebook.

1432
01:11:30,565 --> 01:11:33,735
This thing is chock full of
genius ideas.

1433
01:11:33,735 --> 01:11:34,402
I mean, look at that.

1434
01:11:34,402 --> 01:11:38,280
And his best idea is about a
peach that lives on a farm.

1435
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,574
What's more vulnerable than a
peach?

1436
01:11:40,574 --> 01:11:41,241
What, uh, what do we do?

1437
01:11:41,241 --> 01:11:44,578
I think we should go with the
first pitch... it's genius.

1438
01:11:44,578 --> 01:11:45,245
Uh, how much time we got?

1439
01:11:45,245 --> 01:11:47,122
We got, like, 45 minutes. Well,
come on, let's, uh,

1440
01:11:47,122 --> 01:11:49,124
Try to get a storyboard or
something ready.

1441
01:11:49,124 --> 01:11:50,375
Come on, let's do it. Just try.

1442
01:11:50,375 --> 01:11:52,877
No, you can't sit down and get a
storyboard ready.

1443
01:11:52,877 --> 01:11:54,420
Go and get a storyboard ready.

1444
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:56,672
Oh, boy! Go.

1445
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:02,886
"I'm sorry I ruined your lives

1446
01:12:02,886 --> 01:12:07,808
"And crammed 11 cookies into
the vcr.

1447
01:12:07,808 --> 01:12:13,229
"I don't belong here. I don't
belong anywhere.

1448
01:12:13,646 --> 01:12:19,193
I'll never forget you. Love,
buddy."

1449
01:12:19,193 --> 01:12:20,653
God...

1450
01:12:31,788 --> 01:12:33,289
Hey, buddy.

1451
01:12:35,917 --> 01:12:37,376
Buddy?

1452
01:12:43,298 --> 01:12:45,342
As you know, we need a big
launch fast

1453
01:12:45,342 --> 01:12:46,718
To get the company back on
track.

1454
01:12:46,718 --> 01:12:49,971
So, I think I speak for my fellow
board members

1455
01:12:49,971 --> 01:12:54,434
When I say... this better be good.

1456
01:12:54,434 --> 01:12:56,269
Before I get into the story, uh,

1457
01:12:56,269 --> 01:12:58,270
Let me start with the cover, okay?

1458
01:12:58,270 --> 01:12:59,939
Now, just picture this...

1459
01:12:59,939 --> 01:13:02,858
Dad! I gotta talk to you.

1460
01:13:02,858 --> 01:13:04,443
Walter: Michael, what is it?

1461
01:13:04,443 --> 01:13:05,694
Buddy ran away.

1462
01:13:05,694 --> 01:13:07,821
What? He... he left a note.

1463
01:13:07,821 --> 01:13:10,490
I'm scared, dad, he's gone.

1464
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:12,867
Uh, let me just finish this
meeting,

1465
01:13:12,867 --> 01:13:15,411
And then, um, we’ll figure it
out, okay?

1466
01:13:15,411 --> 01:13:19,832
Figure out what? Buddy cares
about everybody.

1467
01:13:19,832 --> 01:13:22,001
All you care about is yourself.

1468
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:26,213
Hey, Michael.

1469
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,381
Wait.

1470
01:13:31,676 --> 01:13:35,179
We're gonna have to reschedule
this, uh, Mr. Greenway.

1471
01:13:35,179 --> 01:13:36,681
We don't have time to reschedule.

1472
01:13:36,681 --> 01:13:37,973
I wanna hear the damn thing now.

1473
01:13:37,973 --> 01:13:39,183
Son, you'll have to wait.

1474
01:13:39,183 --> 01:13:43,187
No, d-don't tell my kid what
to do, uh...

1475
01:13:43,729 --> 01:13:46,732
Can’t... can’t we do this another
time, Mr. Greenway?

1476
01:13:46,732 --> 01:13:49,526
I flew in just to hear this pitch,

1477
01:13:49,526 --> 01:13:50,860
And I intend to.

1478
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:52,362
It's gonna have to wait.

1479
01:13:52,362 --> 01:13:54,405
If you wanna keep your job, Hobbs,

1480
01:13:54,405 --> 01:13:57,366
You will pitch me this book
right now.

1481
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:07,375
Well... up yours.

1482
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:10,462
Yeah, up yours. Hey.

1483
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,423
Hobbs... Hobbs!

1484
01:14:13,423 --> 01:14:15,216
Hobbs, you walk out of here,

1485
01:14:15,216 --> 01:14:17,760
And... and you're finished at
greenway!

1486
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,303
You're finished!

1487
01:14:36,527 --> 01:14:39,530
I don't belong anywhere.

1488
01:14:41,782 --> 01:14:43,909
Buddy!

1489
01:14:43,909 --> 01:14:45,786
Buddy!

1490
01:14:45,786 --> 01:14:47,954
Buddy, where are you?!

1491
01:14:55,419 --> 01:14:59,799
Prancer, pull! Come on! Come on!

1492
01:14:59,799 --> 01:15:03,385
Vixen, up, up!

1493
01:15:03,385 --> 01:15:05,512
Santa?

1494
01:15:05,929 --> 01:15:08,932
Come on, you can do it.

1495
01:15:08,932 --> 01:15:12,560
Pull up! Pull up!

1496
01:15:20,401 --> 01:15:22,486
Dad! What?

1497
01:15:22,486 --> 01:15:23,987
Michael, where you going?

1498
01:15:23,987 --> 01:15:25,364
Michael!

1499
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:43,881
Santa.

1500
01:15:43,881 --> 01:15:48,593
Back off, slick. You'll scare
the deer.

1501
01:15:48,593 --> 01:15:51,346
Buddy, is that you?

1502
01:15:51,346 --> 01:15:52,347
Are you okay?

1503
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:54,932
Boy, am I glad to see you.

1504
01:15:54,932 --> 01:15:58,853
The Claus meter suddenly just
dropped down to zero.

1505
01:15:58,853 --> 01:16:02,481
There's just no Christmas
spirit anymore.

1506
01:16:02,481 --> 01:16:04,983
And then the strain was too
Much...

1507
01:16:04,983 --> 01:16:08,486
The engine broke free of her
mounts.

1508
01:16:13,449 --> 01:16:16,035
I need an elf's help.

1509
01:16:16,035 --> 01:16:18,621
I... I’m not an elf, Santa.

1510
01:16:18,621 --> 01:16:21,040
I... I can’t do anything right.

1511
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:25,877
Buddy, you're more of an elf than
anyone I ever met,

1512
01:16:25,877 --> 01:16:27,963
And the only one who I would want

1513
01:16:27,963 --> 01:16:30,632
Working on my sleigh tonight.

1514
01:16:30,632 --> 01:16:32,592
Really? Really.

1515
01:16:32,592 --> 01:16:35,011
Will you fix it for me, buddy?

1516
01:16:35,011 --> 01:16:37,847
I'll try. Papa taught me how.

1517
01:16:37,847 --> 01:16:38,681
You gotta find it first.

1518
01:16:38,681 --> 01:16:41,475
It dropped off the sleigh back
over there a ways.

1519
01:16:41,475 --> 01:16:44,394
The engine? The engine, yeah.

1520
01:16:44,394 --> 01:16:47,522
Go, buddy. Go, Mr. Elf!

1521
01:16:47,522 --> 01:16:48,899
Chuckles

1522
01:16:48,899 --> 01:16:50,567
I’m standing here outside
central park

1523
01:16:50,567 --> 01:16:54,112
Where it is unclear exactly
what has happened.

1524
01:16:54,112 --> 01:16:56,030
What we do know is that
authorities

1525
01:16:56,030 --> 01:16:56,906
Have closed the park

1526
01:16:56,906 --> 01:16:58,157
And are in the process of
clearing it.

1527
01:16:58,157 --> 01:17:00,910
The only thing that people can
seem to agree on here

1528
01:17:00,910 --> 01:17:04,413
Is that they saw something fall
from the sky.

1529
01:17:04,413 --> 01:17:05,664
I've got an eyewitness with me

1530
01:17:05,664 --> 01:17:07,874
Who claims to have seen the whole
thing firsthand.

1531
01:17:07,874 --> 01:17:09,084
What did you actually see?

1532
01:17:09,084 --> 01:17:11,628
You know, I was walking around and
I saw this thing,

1533
01:17:11,628 --> 01:17:13,921
And my daughter actually pointed
it out to me.

1534
01:17:13,921 --> 01:17:14,964
Oh, your daughter saw it?

1535
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:16,007
Sweetheart, can you tell me

1536
01:17:16,007 --> 01:17:18,384
What you saw falling out of the
sky?

1537
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:20,094
It was Santa’s sleigh!

1538
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:21,720
News woman chuckles

1539
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,597
Santa’s sleigh, well, there you
have it.

1540
01:17:23,597 --> 01:17:24,431
Santa's in Manhattan.

1541
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:27,601
Sorry to interrupt your first big
news story, charlotte,

1542
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:29,894
But New York one has just received

1543
01:17:29,894 --> 01:17:31,938
Some exclusive amateur news footage

1544
01:17:31,938 --> 01:17:34,023
That you just might Anna follow
up on.

1545
01:17:34,023 --> 01:17:37,443
There seems to be a strange man
dressed as an elf

1546
01:17:37,443 --> 01:17:38,944
Wandering through central park.

1547
01:17:38,944 --> 01:17:41,947
Now, I don't know if this is the
kind of hard-hitting news

1548
01:17:41,947 --> 01:17:43,949
You’re used to covering in buffalo
, charlotte,

1549
01:17:43,949 --> 01:17:45,575
Oh, my god. But here at New York one,

1550
01:17:45,575 --> 01:17:48,078
News is top priority.

1551
01:17:58,587 --> 01:18:01,090
What the heck...?

1552
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:02,966
Hey!

1553
01:18:03,425 --> 01:18:06,136
You found it. Buddy!

1554
01:18:11,558 --> 01:18:13,142
I need to tell you something.

1555
01:18:13,142 --> 01:18:14,477
No, no. Buddy, there's something

1556
01:18:14,477 --> 01:18:15,186
I have to tell you right now.

1557
01:18:15,186 --> 01:18:19,064
Um, I didn't mean anything I said back
there, not word.

1558
01:18:19,064 --> 01:18:23,110
I know you may be a little, um, um...

1559
01:18:23,110 --> 01:18:24,528
Uh, chemically imbalanced,

1560
01:18:24,528 --> 01:18:27,280
But you’ve been right about a lot
of things.

1561
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:30,450
I... I don't want you to leave.

1562
01:18:30,450 --> 01:18:34,120
You're my son, and I... love you.

1563
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:42,252
Uh, buddy, uh...

1564
01:18:42,252 --> 01:18:45,130
What was it you wanted to tell me?

1565
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:47,507
Oh, right. Come with me.

1566
01:18:47,507 --> 01:18:49,301
Right. Come on.

1567
01:18:55,515 --> 01:18:57,016
I'm here with another eyewitness

1568
01:18:57,016 --> 01:18:59,310
Who has his own version of what
happened.

1569
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:00,477
Sir, what did you see?

1570
01:19:00,477 --> 01:19:01,687
I think you’re great, charlotte.

1571
01:19:01,687 --> 01:19:04,022
Uh, I saw something fall from the
sky

1572
01:19:04,022 --> 01:19:05,274
Right into the middle of central
park.

1573
01:19:05,274 --> 01:19:07,651
I mean, you’re a great news lady.

1574
01:19:07,651 --> 01:19:08,485
Thank you.

1575
01:19:08,485 --> 01:19:09,527
Could you tell me a bit more?

1576
01:19:09,527 --> 01:19:10,779
About what you saw fall from the
sky?

1577
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:12,155
Yeah, yeah. Your eyes tell the
story,

1578
01:19:12,155 --> 01:19:14,032
That’s what I love about you.
You've got a great mouth.

1579
01:19:14,032 --> 01:19:16,158
The thing just dropped in the middle of
central park.

1580
01:19:16,158 --> 01:19:19,036
It was amazing, and everybody's, like,
going crazy.

1581
01:19:19,036 --> 01:19:20,996
Dick, uh, according to authorities,

1582
01:19:20,996 --> 01:19:22,206
The area has been cleared.

1583
01:19:22,206 --> 01:19:25,792
Only the central park rangers now
remain in the park.

1584
01:19:25,792 --> 01:19:27,627
These forces are highly trained,

1585
01:19:27,627 --> 01:19:29,045
But rarely see action.

1586
01:19:29,045 --> 01:19:32,173
Some have accused them of being
too gung ho

1587
01:19:32,173 --> 01:19:33,091
When called into duty,

1588
01:19:33,091 --> 01:19:35,551
And their controversial crowd
control tactics

1589
01:19:35,551 --> 01:19:38,554
At the Simon and Garfunkel concert
in '85

1590
01:19:38,554 --> 01:19:40,806
Are still under investigation.

1591
01:19:40,806 --> 01:19:43,225
I knew you’d find it, Mr. Elf!

1592
01:19:43,225 --> 01:19:46,561
Slap it on real quick, we've got
to get going.

1593
01:19:49,022 --> 01:19:50,190
That ta boy.

1594
01:19:50,190 --> 01:19:52,567
Chuckles

1595
01:19:53,234 --> 01:19:56,028
So, uh... you're, uh...

1596
01:19:56,028 --> 01:19:58,697
Santa Claus. Right.

1597
01:19:59,824 --> 01:20:03,785
Would you mind taking this to
your firstborn?

1598
01:20:03,785 --> 01:20:04,328
Sure.

1599
01:20:04,328 --> 01:20:07,539
Um, uh, and my firstborn, he's
an elf?

1600
01:20:07,539 --> 01:20:11,209
Yes. Actually, I’m adopted.

1601
01:20:11,543 --> 01:20:15,546
Uh, Michael, would you open this
hatch for me, please?

1602
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:23,345
That ta boy, thank you.

1603
01:20:23,345 --> 01:20:27,057
So, you’re really Santa Claus?

1604
01:20:27,057 --> 01:20:29,768
You never can tell, kid.

1605
01:20:29,768 --> 01:20:30,643
Tell me, Michael,

1606
01:20:30,643 --> 01:20:32,353
What do you want for Christmas?

1607
01:20:32,353 --> 01:20:33,438
I wanted a skateboard.

1608
01:20:33,438 --> 01:20:38,609
Oh, not just skateboard.

1609
01:20:38,609 --> 01:20:42,613
A real huf board. Looked here.

1610
01:20:42,613 --> 01:20:44,072
Looked here...

1611
01:20:44,072 --> 01:20:46,116
How do you like them apples?

1612
01:20:46,116 --> 01:20:48,868
Go look and see.

1613
01:20:55,166 --> 01:20:56,626
Whoa.

1614
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:04,383
What happened?

1615
01:21:04,383 --> 01:21:07,135
You made my sleigh fly.

1616
01:21:07,135 --> 01:21:07,886
What do you mean?

1617
01:21:07,886 --> 01:21:10,096
Well, before the turbine days,

1618
01:21:10,096 --> 01:21:13,099
This baby used to run solely on
Christmas spirit.

1619
01:21:13,099 --> 01:21:17,895
You believed in me. You made my
sleigh fly.

1620
01:21:17,895 --> 01:21:19,897
Hold it... if you’re really Santa
Claus,

1621
01:21:19,897 --> 01:21:22,316
Then we can just get some news
cameras in here,

1622
01:21:22,316 --> 01:21:23,650
And everyone will believe in you,

1623
01:21:23,650 --> 01:21:24,735
Then your sleigh will fly, right?

1624
01:21:24,735 --> 01:21:28,280
Christmas spirit is about believing,
not seeing.

1625
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:30,740
If the whole world saw me,
all would be lost.

1626
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:34,911
The paparazzi have been trying to
nail me for years.

1627
01:21:34,911 --> 01:21:36,454
Horse whinnies

1628
01:21:37,705 --> 01:21:39,165
Hey, look!

1629
01:21:39,790 --> 01:21:42,668
Horse whinnies

1630
01:21:45,170 --> 01:21:47,672
Oh, no.

1631
01:21:48,131 --> 01:21:51,885
It's the central park rangers.

1632
01:21:51,885 --> 01:21:54,137
Horses whinny

1633
01:21:56,138 --> 01:22:01,435
Dad, Michael... I got a plan.

1634
01:22:09,192 --> 01:22:11,903
Santa: Whoa, wait! Wait, Michael...
my list!

1635
01:22:11,903 --> 01:22:14,697
You bring that list back right now,
you hear me?!

1636
01:22:14,697 --> 01:22:16,741
Come on, give me your hat and coat.

1637
01:22:16,741 --> 01:22:19,702
Mrs. Claus made them for me.

1638
01:22:23,956 --> 01:22:26,958
Hey! Hey, here I am!

1639
01:22:28,835 --> 01:22:29,794
Ho ho ho!

1640
01:22:29,794 --> 01:22:34,465
Hey, ho ho ho! Hey! Hey!

1641
01:22:41,847 --> 01:22:43,891
Excuse me. Thank you. Excuse me.

1642
01:22:43,891 --> 01:22:45,851
So the authorities have not
discovered

1643
01:22:45,851 --> 01:22:47,727
Any reindeer in the park?

1644
01:22:47,727 --> 01:22:49,521
No, no reindeer. Sleigh bells?

1645
01:22:49,521 --> 01:22:50,730
No, no sleigh bells, either.

1646
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:51,731
Elves? Excuse me, please.

1647
01:22:51,731 --> 01:22:52,899
None of that, we really just
need everyone...

1648
01:22:52,899 --> 01:22:53,983
It’s him, it's the real Santa!

1649
01:22:53,983 --> 01:22:55,735
His sleigh won't fly,’ cause nobody
believes in him!

1650
01:22:55,735 --> 01:22:57,695
Charlotte: Did you see something
in the park?

1651
01:22:57,695 --> 01:22:58,362
Everyone out there,

1652
01:22:58,362 --> 01:23:00,864
Santa needs us to believe,
I can prove he's real.

1653
01:23:00,864 --> 01:23:01,740
Look, this is his list!

1654
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:04,743
Okay... well, further confirmation

1655
01:23:04,743 --> 01:23:07,287
That there has been a Santa
sighting tonight.

1656
01:23:07,287 --> 01:23:08,413
We have the naughty and nice list.

Okay, uh, well, obviously we have

1669
01:23:31,851 --> 01:23:33,770
A new development in the story, uh,

1670
01:23:33,770 --> 01:23:36,397
A confirmation that Santa must
have been sighted

1671
01:23:36,397 --> 01:23:38,232
Because we have his book right
here.

1672
01:23:38,232 --> 01:23:39,984
Chuckles what's your name?

1673
01:23:39,984 --> 01:23:43,320
Uh, I’m charlotte den on, New York one.

1674
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,906
"D," "d..."

1675
01:23:46,490 --> 01:23:48,575
Charlotte den on wants tiffany

1676
01:23:48,575 --> 01:23:51,286
And for her boyfriend to stop
dragging his feet

1677
01:23:51,286 --> 01:23:52,370
And commit already.

1678
01:23:52,370 --> 01:23:54,831
Crowd oohs and aahs

1679
01:23:57,291 --> 01:23:58,250
We’ve got power!

1680
01:23:58,250 --> 01:24:00,544
Newsman: Charlotte...

1681
01:24:00,544 --> 01:24:02,379
Hey, turn the cameras back on!

1682
01:24:02,379 --> 01:24:03,547
Who told you to say that?

1683
01:24:03,547 --> 01:24:04,464
It's the real Santa.

1684
01:24:04,464 --> 01:24:06,550
We need to get these cameras
back on.

1685
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:07,759
He needs our help!

1686
01:24:07,759 --> 01:24:10,095
Hey, Michael, are you okay?

1687
01:24:10,095 --> 01:24:10,804
Yeah, I’m fine.

1688
01:24:10,804 --> 01:24:14,057
But buddy, he's... he’s in the
park with Santa,

1689
01:24:14,057 --> 01:24:15,308
The sleigh won't fly

1690
01:24:15,308 --> 01:24:17,310
'cause there’s no Christmas
spirit.

1691
01:24:17,310 --> 01:24:19,562
Michael! Mom!

1692
01:24:19,562 --> 01:24:22,981
Michael! Ohh!

1693
01:24:22,981 --> 01:24:25,317
Are you okay? I'm fine.

1694
01:24:25,317 --> 01:24:28,320
The best way to spread
Christmas cheer

1695
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:32,448
Is singing loud for all
to hear.

1696
01:24:33,533 --> 01:24:34,992
Sighs

1697
01:24:36,786 --> 01:24:39,830
Buddy... better get going,
get in now!

1698
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:42,499
Santa, I’m not done with the
engine yet!

1699
01:24:42,499 --> 01:24:43,834
Can’t wait!

1700
01:24:43,834 --> 01:24:46,420
On, dasher, on, dancer...

1701
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:48,797
I’m not done with the engine!

1702
01:24:48,797 --> 01:24:51,299
Santa cheers

1703
01:24:52,634 --> 01:24:53,843
That’s okay.

1704
01:24:53,843 --> 01:24:57,138
You get started, I’ll catch up!

1705
01:25:02,017 --> 01:25:04,353
You know, he wasn't lying.

1706
01:25:04,353 --> 01:25:07,105
Chuckles merry Christmas.

1707
01:25:07,105 --> 01:25:08,898
Chuckles

1708
01:25:11,943 --> 01:25:13,861
Santa, I can't...

1709
01:25:13,861 --> 01:25:16,489
Stop messing around and get in!

1710
01:25:16,489 --> 01:25:19,825
Aah! Toy squeals

1711
01:25:24,871 --> 01:25:27,040
Santa, why are they chasing us?!

1712
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,042
I put them on the naughty list,

1713
01:25:29,042 --> 01:25:31,503
And they never forgave me.

1714
01:25:36,882 --> 01:25:41,053
You better watch out,
you better not cry

1715
01:25:41,053 --> 01:25:44,514
You better not pout,
I’m telling you why

1716
01:25:44,514 --> 01:25:50,395
Santa Claus is coming' to town

1717
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:54,357
Santa: Yaah, yaah, yaah!

1718
01:25:55,399 --> 01:25:57,485
Santa: Up, up, pull up!

1719
01:25:57,485 --> 01:26:01,989
Buddy! We need power, we're
gonna crash!

1720
01:26:01,989 --> 01:26:06,159
He's making a list,
Checking it twice

1721
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:09,996
Gonna find out who’s naughty and nice

1722
01:26:09,996 --> 01:26:16,377
Santa claus is coming' to town

1723
01:26:16,377 --> 01:26:20,965
He sees you when you're sleeping

1724
01:26:20,965 --> 01:26:23,884
He knows when you're awake

1725
01:26:23,884 --> 01:26:27,679
He knows if you've been bad or good

1726
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:30,432
So be good for goodness sake

1727
01:26:30,432 --> 01:26:35,144
Oh, you better watch out,
you better not cry

1728
01:26:35,144 --> 01:26:39,106
You better not pout, I’m telling
you why

1729
01:26:39,106 --> 01:26:45,195
Santa Claus is coming to town

1730
01:26:51,534 --> 01:26:52,619
Devilish laughter aah!

1731
01:26:52,619 --> 01:26:55,163
Santa: You can do it!
Come on, dancer.

1732
01:26:55,163 --> 01:26:57,915
That's my boy.

1733
01:26:57,915 --> 01:26:59,125
Pull, cupid! Aah!

1734
01:26:59,125 --> 01:27:01,251
Pull, dasher!

1735
01:27:01,251 --> 01:27:05,422
I'm getting too old for this job.

1736
01:27:05,422 --> 01:27:06,923
Now!

1737
01:27:09,718 --> 01:27:11,928
Screaming

1738
01:27:14,972 --> 01:27:17,516
Laughing

1739
01:27:20,227 --> 01:27:21,937
The engine's gone!

1740
01:27:21,937 --> 01:27:23,147
We're toast!

1741
01:27:23,147 --> 01:27:24,940
Screaming

1742
01:27:28,735 --> 01:27:30,987
Well, still no sign of Santa,

1743
01:27:30,987 --> 01:27:33,072
But some spontaneous Christmas
caroling

1744
01:27:33,072 --> 01:27:33,990
Has broken out

1745
01:27:33,990 --> 01:27:36,033
Right here in front of central
park.

1746
01:27:36,033 --> 01:27:37,118
Let's have a listen in.

1747
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:38,953
He sees you when you're sleeping

1748
01:27:38,953 --> 01:27:42,498
He knows if you're awake

1749
01:27:42,498 --> 01:27:46,460
He knows if you've been bad or
good

1750
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:50,255
So be good for goodness sake

1751
01:27:50,255 --> 01:27:50,713
Hey!

1752
01:27:50,713 --> 01:27:53,716
You better watch out, you better
not cry

1753
01:27:53,716 --> 01:27:58,262
You better not pout, I’m telling
you why

1754
01:27:58,262 --> 01:27:58,679
Come on!

1755
01:27:58,679 --> 01:28:04,017
Santa claus is coming' to town

1756
01:28:04,017 --> 01:28:07,229
Santa: Just a little more!

1757
01:28:12,275 --> 01:28:13,526
Hal-yah!

1758
01:28:13,526 --> 01:28:16,153
He knows when you're awake

1759
01:28:16,153 --> 01:28:17,488
He knows if you've

1760
01:28:17,488 --> 01:28:20,032
Wait... you're not singing.

1761
01:28:20,032 --> 01:28:21,033
Yes, I am.

1762
01:28:21,033 --> 01:28:24,244
No, you're not. You're just moving
your lips.

1763
01:28:24,244 --> 01:28:26,121
Santa!

1764
01:28:26,121 --> 01:28:28,707
Michael, please, what's the big deal?

1765
01:28:28,707 --> 01:28:29,541
Dad.

1766
01:28:29,541 --> 01:28:30,542
I'm telling you why

1767
01:28:30,542 --> 01:28:36,297
Santa claus is coming to town

1768
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:40,801
Laughing

1769
01:28:42,011 --> 01:28:44,680
Santa chuckling

1770
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:46,681
Oh! Ha ha ha!

1771
01:28:46,681 --> 01:28:48,808
Santa: Now, my beauties!

1772
01:28:48,808 --> 01:28:50,810
Santa chuckling

1773
01:28:56,065 --> 01:28:57,191
Bye-bye.

1774
01:28:57,191 --> 01:28:58,567
Santa: Just like the old days!

1775
01:28:58,567 --> 01:29:01,654
Newsman: Charlotte? Charlotte?

1776
01:29:01,654 --> 01:29:04,364
Well, I guess we’ll never know for
sure

1777
01:29:04,364 --> 01:29:06,366
What happened this Christmas Eve?

1778
01:29:06,366 --> 01:29:07,742
In central park.

1779
01:29:07,742 --> 01:29:13,873
Santa: Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!

1780
01:29:13,873 --> 01:29:16,792
Ho ho ho!

1781
01:29:16,792 --> 01:29:19,753
Papa elf: And so, with a little help,

1782
01:29:19,753 --> 01:29:21,714
Buddy managed to save Christmas.

1783
01:29:21,714 --> 01:29:24,591
And his spirit saved a lot of other
People, too.

1784
01:29:24,591 --> 01:29:31,389
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1785
01:29:31,389 --> 01:29:37,770
And never brought to mind

1786
01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:45,068
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1787
01:29:45,068 --> 01:29:48,613
Walter started his own independent
publishing company.

1788
01:29:48,613 --> 01:29:50,865
His first book was written by a
brand new,

1789
01:29:50,865 --> 01:29:54,077
Critically acclaimed children's
author.

1790
01:29:54,077 --> 01:29:55,703
The book was elf...

1791
01:29:55,703 --> 01:29:57,621
A, uh, fictional story

1792
01:29:57,621 --> 01:30:00,207
About an adopted elf named buddy

1793
01:30:00,207 --> 01:30:01,834
Who was raised in the North Pole?

1794
01:30:01,834 --> 01:30:03,836
Went to New York, ate spaghetti,

1795
01:30:03,836 --> 01:30:05,295
Worked in a shiny mailroom,

1796
01:30:05,295 --> 01:30:08,590
And eventually saved Christmas.

1797
01:30:08,590 --> 01:30:11,342
"First, I traveled through the
seven levels

1798
01:30:11,342 --> 01:30:13,678
"Of the candy cane forest,

1799
01:30:13,678 --> 01:30:18,307
"Past the sea of twirly-swirly
gumdrops,

1800
01:30:18,307 --> 01:30:23,145
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel."

1801
01:30:23,145 --> 01:30:25,397
And as for me, I can't complain.

1802
01:30:25,397 --> 01:30:27,816
Buddy comes up to visit from time
to time.

1803
01:30:27,816 --> 01:30:32,111
In the meadow we can build a
snowman

1804
01:30:32,111 --> 01:30:34,906
And pretend that he is parson
brown

1805
01:30:34,906 --> 01:30:38,117
Oh, thank you, Jovie. That's very
sweet of you.

1806
01:30:38,117 --> 01:30:39,660
You're welcome, papa.

1807
01:30:39,660 --> 01:30:43,664
But you can do the job when
you're in town

1808
01:30:43,664 --> 01:30:45,165
Hey, Suzie.

1809
01:30:45,165 --> 01:30:46,124
Come here, little one.

1810
01:30:46,124 --> 01:30:48,668
When it snows, ain't it
thrilling?

1811
01:30:48,668 --> 01:30:50,170
Papa wants to see you.

1812
01:30:50,170 --> 01:30:53,756
Though your nose get a
little chilling

1813
01:30:53,756 --> 01:30:54,173
Buddy...

1814
01:30:54,173 --> 01:30:56,467
We’ll frolic and play buddy...
buddy...

1815
01:30:56,467 --> 01:31:02,723
The Eskimo way, walking in a
winter wonderland

1816
01:31:19,989 --> 01:31:24,201
In the meadow we can build a
snowman

1817
01:31:24,201 --> 01:31:28,413
And pretend that he is parson
brown

1818
01:31:28,413 --> 01:31:32,834
He’ll say, are you married,
we'll say no, man

1819
01:31:32,834 --> 01:31:37,213
But you can do the job when you
in town, brother

1820
01:31:37,213 --> 01:31:42,468
Later on, we'll conspire

1821
01:31:42,468 --> 01:31:46,388
As we dream by the fire

1822
01:31:46,388 --> 01:31:50,850
To face unafraid the plans
That we made

1823
01:31:50,850 --> 01:31:54,937
Walking in a winter wonderland

1824
01:31:54,937 --> 01:31:59,483
Walking in a winter wonderland

1825
01:32:10,910 --> 01:32:12,412
I really can't stay

1826
01:32:12,412 --> 01:32:16,916
But, baby, it's cold outside

1827
01:32:16,916 --> 01:32:18,000
I’ve got to go 'way

1828
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,754
But, baby, it's cold outside

1829
01:32:21,754 --> 01:32:24,047
This evening has been

1830
01:32:24,047 --> 01:32:26,758
Been hoping that you'd drop in

1831
01:32:26,758 --> 01:32:28,218
So very nice

1832
01:32:28,218 --> 01:32:33,431
I’ll hold your hands, they're
just like ice

1833
01:32:33,431 --> 01:32:36,267
My mother will start to worry

1834
01:32:36,267 --> 01:32:38,477
Beautiful, what's your hurry?

1835
01:32:38,477 --> 01:32:41,897
And father will be pacing the floor

1836
01:32:41,897 --> 01:32:43,899
Listen to that fireplace roar

1837
01:32:43,899 --> 01:32:46,943
So, really, I’d better scurry

1838
01:32:46,943 --> 01:32:49,279
Beautiful, please don't hurry

1839
01:32:49,279 --> 01:32:52,782
Well, maybe just a half a drink more

1840
01:32:52,782 --> 01:32:55,576
Put some records on while I pour

1841
01:32:55,576 --> 01:32:57,787
The neighbors might think

1842
01:32:57,787 --> 01:33:00,289
Baby, it's bad out there

1843
01:33:00,289 --> 01:33:02,041
Say, what's in this drink?

1844
01:33:02,041 --> 01:33:06,253
No cabs to be had out there

1845
01:33:06,253 --> 01:33:07,963
I wish I knew how

1846
01:33:07,963 --> 01:33:10,340
Your eyes are like starlight now

1847
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:12,300
To break the spell

1848
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:17,346
I’ll take your hat, your hair
looks swell

1849
01:33:17,346 --> 01:33:20,307
I ought to say no, no, no, sir

1850
01:33:20,307 --> 01:33:22,434
Mind if I move in closer?

1851
01:33:22,434 --> 01:33:25,520
At least I’m gonna say that I
tried

1852
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:28,815
What’s the sense of hurting
my pride?

1853
01:33:28,815 --> 01:33:30,525
I really can't stay

1854
01:33:30,525 --> 01:33:32,569
Baby, don't hold out

1855
01:33:32,569 --> 01:33:39,575
Ah, but it’s cold outside

1856
01:33:47,833 --> 01:33:49,125
I simply must go

1857
01:33:49,125 --> 01:33:53,087
But, baby, it's cold outside

1858
01:33:53,087 --> 01:33:55,047
The answer is no

1859
01:33:55,047 --> 01:33:58,342
But, baby, it's cold outside

1860
01:33:58,342 --> 01:34:00,135
This welcome has been

1861
01:34:00,135 --> 01:34:02,846
I’m lucky that you dropped in

1862
01:34:02,846 --> 01:34:04,806
So nice and warm

1863
01:34:04,806 --> 01:34:09,853
Look out the window at that
storm

1864
01:34:09,853 --> 01:34:12,605
My sister will be suspicious

1865
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:15,108
Gosh, your lips look delicious

1866
01:34:15,108 --> 01:34:18,360
My brother will be there at
the door

1867
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:20,571
Waves upon tropical shore

1868
01:34:20,571 --> 01:34:23,949
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious

1869
01:34:23,949 --> 01:34:26,034
Oh, your lips look delicious

1870
01:34:26,034 --> 01:34:28,453
Well, maybe just a cigarette more

1871
01:34:28,453 --> 01:34:31,998
Never such a pleasure before

1872
01:34:31,998 --> 01:34:33,833
I’ve got to get home

1873
01:34:33,833 --> 01:34:36,544
But, baby, you'll freeze out there

1874
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:38,379
Say, lend me your comb

1875
01:34:38,379 --> 01:34:42,383
It’s up to your knees out there

1876
01:34:42,383 --> 01:34:44,509
You’ve really been grand

1877
01:34:44,509 --> 01:34:46,553
I thrill when you touch my hand

1878
01:34:46,553 --> 01:34:48,680
But don’t you see

1879
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:53,643
How can you do this thing to me?

1880
01:34:53,643 --> 01:34:56,145
There's bound to be talk tomorrow

1881
01:34:56,145 --> 01:34:59,356
Think of my lifelong sorrow

1882
01:34:59,356 --> 01:35:02,067
At least there will be plenty
implied

1883
01:35:02,067 --> 01:35:05,070
If you caught pneumonia and died

1884
01:35:05,070 --> 01:35:06,696
I really can't stay

1885
01:35:06,696 --> 01:35:09,157
Get rid of that hold out

1886
01:35:09,157 --> 01:35:13,161
Ah, but it's cold

1887
01:35:13,161 --> 01:35:18,916
Outside
