1
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:28,887
Oh, hello.

2
00:00:28,924 --> 00:00:30,843
You're, uh, you're probably here

3
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,967
About the, Uh, the story.

4
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:35,018
Elves love to tell stories.

5
00:00:35,054 --> 00:00:37,849
I-I'll bet you didn't know that
about elves.

6
00:00:37,886 --> 00:00:40,161
There's, uh, probably a lot of things

7
00:00:40,198 --> 00:00:42,401
You... you didn't know about elves.

8
00:00:42,437 --> 00:00:47,113
Another... another interesting
Uh, elf ism

9
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:52,572
Uh, there are only three jobs available
to an elf.

10
00:00:52,608 --> 00:00:54,216
The first is making shoes at night

11
00:00:54,252 --> 00:00:55,824
While, you know, while the old...

12
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:57,456
The old cobbler sleeps.

13
00:00:57,492 --> 00:01:00,537
Lazy bum. Couldn't even make a clog.

14
00:01:00,574 --> 00:01:02,163
You can bake cookies

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:02,961
In a tree. Hey!

16
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:06,083
As you can imagine, it's, uh, dangerous
Having an oven

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,586
In an oak tree during the dry season.

18
00:01:08,623 --> 00:01:10,301
Screaming I wanna make shoes!

19
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:12,881
But the third job... uh, some call
It, uh,

20
00:01:12,918 --> 00:01:15,096
"The show," or... or "the big dance,"

21
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:19,262
It's the profession that every elf
Aspires to,

22
00:01:19,298 --> 00:01:23,391
And that is to build toys in
Santa's workshop.

23
00:01:23,428 --> 00:01:25,602
Only two weeks left till Christmas!

24
00:01:26,144 --> 00:01:29,105
I-it's a job only an elf can do.

25
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:30,540
Our... our nimble fingers,

26
00:01:30,577 --> 00:01:32,321
Natural cheer and active minds

27
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,030
Are perfect for toy-building.

28
00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:37,029
They... they tried using gnomes
And trolls,

29
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:39,907
But the gnomes drank too much...

30
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,243
...and the trolls weren't toilet
trained.

31
00:01:44,702 --> 00:01:49,874
No human being has ever set... set
foot in Santa's workshop.

32
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:52,668
Uh, that is until about 30 years ago,

33
00:01:52,705 --> 00:01:55,668
And, as you may have guessed,

34
00:01:55,704 --> 00:01:58,632
That's where our story begins.

35
00:02:30,703 --> 00:02:32,163
Wow!

36
00:02:34,957 --> 00:02:36,501
Whoa!

37
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,556
Ooh!

38
00:03:14,593 --> 00:03:17,706
Wow!

39
00:03:23,752 --> 00:03:26,275
Humming

40
00:03:26,312 --> 00:03:28,799
Ow! Ow!

41
00:03:42,771 --> 00:03:44,188
Whoa!

42
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:49,277
Are you sleepy?

43
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,033
Here we are.

44
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:55,657
We're just going to make you feel
so comfortable.

45
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,719
Here we are.

46
00:03:57,756 --> 00:03:59,708
There you are.

47
00:03:59,744 --> 00:04:02,961
It's time to go to sleep.

48
00:04:02,998 --> 00:04:06,542
Maybe by next Christmas you'll
Have a home.

49
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,803
Merry Christmas, my angel.

50
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:26,728
Creaking

51
00:04:43,369 --> 00:04:46,204
Santa: Mmm...

52
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:54,087
Bars clang

53
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:18,234
Cheering music playing

54
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:27,581
All right, all right.

55
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:31,121
We've had another very successful
year.

56
00:05:31,157 --> 00:05:32,877
Cheering

57
00:05:32,914 --> 00:05:35,500
So, after all that hard work,

58
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:38,086
It's time to start preparations

59
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:39,713
For next Christmas!

60
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:43,175
Cheering

61
00:05:48,596 --> 00:05:53,266
What in the name of Sam hill
Is that?

62
00:05:54,642 --> 00:05:57,103
Elves: Wow...

63
00:05:59,856 --> 00:06:02,150
Male elf: A baby...

64
00:06:04,777 --> 00:06:07,029
Elf: "little buddy diapers."

65
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,244
His name is buddy. He must've...

66
00:06:09,281 --> 00:06:11,658
Snuck into your sack at the
orphanage.

67
00:06:11,695 --> 00:06:12,123
What do we do?

68
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:14,786
Papa elf: So, Santa had a
Decision to make,

69
00:06:14,823 --> 00:06:17,414
And fortunately, when it
Comes to babies,

70
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:18,712
Santa's a... a pushover.

71
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:20,959
So, buddy stayed with, uh
An older elf

72
00:06:20,996 --> 00:06:21,882
Who had always wanted a child?

73
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,463
But had been so committed to
Building toys, he...

74
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:29,300
He, well, had forgotten to
Settle down.

75
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:29,889
Santa.

76
00:06:29,926 --> 00:06:33,178
Yes, yes, I... I raised buddy.

77
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,393
I was his adopted father.

78
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,145
Though buddy grew twice as fast,

79
00:06:37,182 --> 00:06:41,394
He... he wasn't any different from
the other children.

80
00:06:41,431 --> 00:06:44,061
Chuckles not too fast, buddy.

81
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:46,654
I mean, not... not really.

82
00:06:46,691 --> 00:06:48,568
Before we learn how to build
The latest

83
00:06:48,604 --> 00:06:50,900
In extreme graphic chipset
Processors,

84
00:06:50,937 --> 00:06:53,197
Let's recite the
"Code of the elves,"

85
00:06:53,234 --> 00:06:54,070
Shall we?

86
00:06:54,106 --> 00:06:54,870
Number one.

87
00:06:54,907 --> 00:06:57,868
"Treat every day like Christmas."

88
00:06:57,905 --> 00:06:58,624
Number two.

89
00:06:58,661 --> 00:07:02,665
"There's room for everyone on the
Nice list."

90
00:07:02,702 --> 00:07:03,754
Number three.

91
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,168
"The best way to spread Christmas
Cheer

92
00:07:07,205 --> 00:07:11,005
Is singing loud for all to hear."

93
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:13,883
And one day, when buddy was
old enough,

94
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,090
I made him my own personal
apprentice.

95
00:07:16,127 --> 00:07:18,175
I've never been in this room
before.

96
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:20,222
Well, I think it's time you start

97
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:22,182
Your tinker training.

98
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,233
Gasps Santa's sleigh.

99
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,897
You're gonna help me make it fly.

100
00:07:30,691 --> 00:07:32,984
I thought the magical reindeer made
The sleighs fly.

101
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:35,778
And where do the reindeer get
their magic from?

102
00:07:35,814 --> 00:07:40,282
Christmas spirit. Everybody
knows that.

103
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,386
Well, silly as it sounds,

104
00:07:42,423 --> 00:07:44,397
A lot of people down south

105
00:07:44,434 --> 00:07:46,371
Don't believe in Santa Claus.

106
00:07:46,408 --> 00:07:48,169
What?!

107
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:51,418
Well, who do they think puts all?
their toys under the tree?

108
00:07:51,455 --> 00:07:53,355
Well, there's a rumor floating around

109
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:55,254
That, uh, that the parents do it.

110
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,178
That's... that's ridiculous.

111
00:07:57,215 --> 00:08:00,217
I mean, parents couldn't do that
all in one night.

112
00:08:00,254 --> 00:08:01,307
What about Santa's cookies?

113
00:08:01,343 --> 00:08:03,805
I suppose parents eat them, too?

114
00:08:03,841 --> 00:08:04,852
Yeah, I, uh, I... I know,

115
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:07,349
Uh, and every earless and less
People

116
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:08,021
Believe in Santa Claus.

117
00:08:08,058 --> 00:08:11,479
I mean, we have a real energy
crisis on our hands.

118
00:08:11,515 --> 00:08:11,942
Oh.

119
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:15,940
I mean, just see how low the, uh
Claus meter is.

120
00:08:15,977 --> 00:08:17,731
That's shocking.

121
00:08:17,768 --> 00:08:19,450
That's why I came up

122
00:08:19,486 --> 00:08:21,905
With this little beauty in the '60s.

123
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:25,407
Engine hums to life

124
00:08:26,493 --> 00:08:27,749
WH-what is it?

125
00:08:27,786 --> 00:08:29,250
It's a cringle 3000...

126
00:08:29,286 --> 00:08:32,956
A 500-reindeer power jet turbine
engine.

127
00:08:32,992 --> 00:08:34,464
Without it, the sleigh couldn't

128
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,420
Get more than, uh, a few feet off
the ground.

129
00:08:40,297 --> 00:08:41,839
Well, it looks like we got

130
00:08:41,876 --> 00:08:43,880
A short in the thermo coupler.

131
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:45,885
You wanna give mea hand with that?

132
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:47,350
You want me to help?

133
00:08:47,386 --> 00:08:49,764
As much as, uh, buddy was accepted

134
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,930
By his family and friends,

135
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:54,023
There were a few drawbacks

136
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,854
To being, uh, a human in, uh
an elf's world.

137
00:08:57,891 --> 00:09:00,816
Music plays chattering

138
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,043
Hey, Ming Ming.

139
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,007
Um...

140
00:09:22,044 --> 00:09:26,382
I'm gonna be a little bit short
on today's quota.

141
00:09:26,418 --> 00:09:27,428
It's all right, buddy.

142
00:09:27,465 --> 00:09:29,008
Just how many etch-a-sketches

143
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:32,280
Did you get finished?

144
00:09:32,316 --> 00:09:35,514
Come on, buddy. How many?

145
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:39,810
I made, uh... 85.

146
00:09:45,314 --> 00:09:47,359
Eighty-five?

147
00:09:48,068 --> 00:09:49,903
That puts you...

148
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:51,867
915 off the pace.

149
00:09:51,904 --> 00:09:53,385
Female elf: Ooh... that's bad.

150
00:09:53,421 --> 00:09:54,830
Why don't you just say it?

151
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:57,388
I'm the worst toy maker in
the world.

152
00:09:57,425 --> 00:09:59,912
I'm a cotton-headed ninny-muggins.

153
00:09:59,948 --> 00:10:00,418
Gasps

154
00:10:00,454 --> 00:10:03,332
No, buddy, you're not cotton-
headed ninny-muggins.

155
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:06,418
We all just have different talents
That's all.

156
00:10:06,455 --> 00:10:07,341
Seems like everyone else

157
00:10:07,377 --> 00:10:08,800
Have the same talents
except for me.

158
00:10:08,837 --> 00:10:11,631
You... you have, you have lots of
Talents, uh...

159
00:10:11,668 --> 00:10:15,177
Special talents in fact, like
Um, uh...

160
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:15,932
Special talents?

161
00:10:15,968 --> 00:10:18,680
You changed the batteries in the
smoke detector.

162
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:19,435
You sure did... aaa's.

163
00:10:19,472 --> 00:10:22,684
And in six months, you'll have
to check 'em again...

164
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,397
Won't he?

165
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:26,145
And you're the only baritone in
the elf choir.

166
00:10:26,181 --> 00:10:28,396
You bring us down whole octave.

167
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:29,728
In a good way.

168
00:10:29,765 --> 00:10:30,988
See, buddy?

169
00:10:31,024 --> 00:10:33,193
You're not a cotton-headed ninny-
muggings.

170
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,030
You're just... special.

171
00:10:37,614 --> 00:10:42,993
And so, buddy was sent where the...
The special elves work.

172
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,162
Devilish laughter aah!

173
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,213
("Pop Goes the Weasel" playing)

174
00:10:56,548 --> 00:10:59,050
Laughter ah!

175
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:00,552
Sighs

176
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:07,933
("Pop Goes the Weasel" playing)

177
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:18,652
Laughter

178
00:11:20,487 --> 00:11:20,950
Hey, foom foom...

179
00:11:20,987 --> 00:11:23,281
I hate to do this to you, but you
Think you could

180
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:25,574
Help me pick up the slack on those
etch-a-sketches?

181
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:27,701
No problem. I appreciate it.

182
00:11:27,738 --> 00:11:28,375
Buddy is killing me.

183
00:11:28,412 --> 00:11:31,997
I already got lum lum and choochoo pulling' doubles.

184
00:11:32,034 --> 00:11:33,559
That was quick thinking yesterday

185
00:11:33,595 --> 00:11:35,007
With that 'special talents' thing.

186
00:11:35,043 --> 00:11:36,335
Ming Ming: I feel bad for the guy.

187
00:11:36,372 --> 00:11:37,591
I just hope he doesn't get wise.

188
00:11:37,627 --> 00:11:41,215
Well, if he hasn't figured out
He's a human by now,

189
00:11:41,252 --> 00:11:43,591
I don't think he ever will.

190
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,556
Foom foom: If he hasn't figured
Out he's a human

191
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:52,599
By now, I don't think he ever will.

192
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,520
I think they're too small.

193
00:11:58,148 --> 00:12:02,443
Ming Ming: You're just... special.

194
00:12:04,945 --> 00:12:07,196
Snores

195
00:12:08,282 --> 00:12:10,241
Buddy sings deeply

196
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:12,512
Sneakers screech

197
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:14,746
Devilish laughter

198
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:22,211
You don't look so good, buddy.

199
00:12:22,247 --> 00:12:22,717
Are you okay?

200
00:12:22,753 --> 00:12:26,256
I'll be okay, I just need a glass
of water.

201
00:12:26,293 --> 00:12:28,467
Aah!

202
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:31,470
Buddy...

203
00:12:32,554 --> 00:12:34,764
Unh! Aah!

204
00:12:50,613 --> 00:12:51,952
Knock on door

205
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:54,032
Buddy, are you okay?

206
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:56,039
I'm sorry, papa.

207
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:58,459
I just need some alone time.

208
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,080
Buddy, I... I think we... we have
to talk.

209
00:13:01,117 --> 00:13:04,227
Buddy, uh, I think there's something

210
00:13:04,263 --> 00:13:07,300
I... I probably should tell you.

211
00:13:07,337 --> 00:13:10,798
You probably should have found
out a long...

212
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:11,970
A long time ago.

213
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:15,052
I then proceeded to tell buddy of
how his father

214
00:13:15,088 --> 00:13:17,989
Had fallen in love when he was
very young

215
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:20,890
With a beautiful girl named
Susan wells,

216
00:13:20,927 --> 00:13:22,022
And how buddy was born

217
00:13:22,058 --> 00:13:24,560
And put up for adoption by
his mother,

218
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:27,522
And how she had later passed away.

219
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:28,527
I... I told him his father

220
00:13:28,563 --> 00:13:31,066
Had never even known that
Buddy was born,

221
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:31,822
And most importantly,

222
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:33,740
I told him where his father was...

223
00:13:33,777 --> 00:13:37,864
Uh, in a magical land called
new York City.

224
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,238
My dad works there?

225
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:42,577
Empire state building.

226
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,166
Hey, buddy, wanna pick some
snow berries?

227
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,044
Not now, arctic puffin.

228
00:13:53,295 --> 00:13:55,797
Hello, buddy. Oh... hi, Leon.

229
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,714
Why the long face, partner?

230
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:01,007
It seems I'm... I'm not an elf.

231
00:14:01,043 --> 00:14:03,654
'Course you're not. You're 6'3"

232
00:14:03,691 --> 00:14:06,266
And had a beard since you were 15.

233
00:14:06,302 --> 00:14:07,355
Papa says my real father

234
00:14:07,392 --> 00:14:10,562
Lives in a magical place far away.

235
00:14:10,598 --> 00:14:11,622
I don't know what to do.

236
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:12,610
At least you have a daddy.

237
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:16,859
I was just rolled up one day and
left out here in the cold.

238
00:14:16,896 --> 00:14:19,570
But the thing is, I've never even left
the North Pole.

239
00:14:19,606 --> 00:14:21,965
Buddy, I've been around the world
Many times

240
00:14:22,002 --> 00:14:24,287
When I was a young cumulus
nimbus cloud.

241
00:14:24,324 --> 00:14:28,162
It's a wonderful place, filled with
Wondrous creatures...

242
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:28,667
Except dogs.

243
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:31,581
Oh, by the way, don't eat the
yellow snow.

244
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:32,170
Oh, I know that.

245
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:36,294
All I'm sayin' is, this might be
The golden opportunity

246
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,087
To find out whom you really are.

247
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:44,223
So, I hear you're going

248
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:47,179
On a little journey to
the big city.

249
00:14:47,216 --> 00:14:48,351
Yup. Ahh.

250
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,639
I'm kind a nervous.

251
00:14:49,675 --> 00:14:50,229
Chuckles

252
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,225
Leon says New York is pretty
different.

253
00:14:52,261 --> 00:14:53,272
Oh, don't pay attention to Leon.

254
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:57,271
He's never been anywhere.
He doesn't have any feet.

255
00:14:57,308 --> 00:14:59,899
I've been to New York thousands
of times.

256
00:14:59,935 --> 00:15:00,918
Really? Mm-hmm.

257
00:15:00,955 --> 00:15:01,865
What's it like?

258
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,737
Well, there are some things you
should know.

259
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:07,340
First off, you see gum on
The street,

260
00:15:07,377 --> 00:15:09,909
Leave it there. It's not
free candy.

261
00:15:09,945 --> 00:15:11,123
Oh. Second,

262
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,703
There are, like, 30 ray's
pizzas.

263
00:15:13,739 --> 00:15:16,247
They all claim to be the
Original,

264
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,879
But the real one' son 11th.

265
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,522
And if you see a sign that
Says "peep show,"

266
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,129
That doesn't mean that
They're letting you

267
00:15:23,165 --> 00:15:26,382
Look at presents before Christmas.

268
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:27,180
Can't wait to see my dad...

269
00:15:27,216 --> 00:15:30,719
We're gonna go ices skating and...
And eat sugar plums.

270
00:15:30,756 --> 00:15:33,031
Yeah, that's the other thing

271
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:35,306
I wanted to talk to you about.

272
00:15:35,343 --> 00:15:39,185
You know, buddy... sighs

273
00:15:39,222 --> 00:15:41,276
Your father...

274
00:15:41,313 --> 00:15:44,732
Well... he's on the naughty list.

275
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:48,193
No!

276
00:15:49,152 --> 00:15:53,324
You're taking the books back?

277
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,288
Chuckles

278
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:56,660
See, I... I see what you're trying
to do here.

279
00:15:56,696 --> 00:15:58,513
Y- you're trying to make me feel bad,

280
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,330
When, in actuality, you're the one

281
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:01,378
That missed the payments.

282
00:16:01,415 --> 00:16:05,335
But the children love the books.

283
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:06,174
I know that, uh...

284
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:08,462
You know, I'm the one that ran
The focus groups,

285
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:09,927
But I like hearing that.

286
00:16:09,964 --> 00:16:13,342
Listen, some people, they just
Lose sight

287
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:15,140
Of what's important in life.

288
00:16:15,177 --> 00:16:20,974
That doesn't mean they can't find
their way again, huh?

289
00:16:21,011 --> 00:16:21,814
Maybe all they need

290
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,477
Is just a little Christmas spirit.

291
00:16:24,514 --> 00:16:27,403
Cheering

292
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:29,982
Well, uh, I... I'm good at that.

293
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:32,484
I know you are.

294
00:16:44,288 --> 00:16:46,211
And I'll...

295
00:16:46,247 --> 00:16:46,920
I'll always, uh,

296
00:16:46,957 --> 00:16:50,001
I'll always be here for you.

297
00:16:56,466 --> 00:16:58,884
Now, uh...

298
00:16:58,921 --> 00:17:01,303
Go... uh, get.

299
00:17:12,272 --> 00:17:12,986
Bye, guys.

300
00:17:13,022 --> 00:17:16,318
Bye, buddy. Bye, buddy. Take care.

301
00:17:16,354 --> 00:17:18,277
Bye-bye.

302
00:17:19,945 --> 00:17:21,536
Bye-bye.

303
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:22,822
Bye-bye, buddy.

There, there.

306
00:17:28,788 --> 00:17:30,684
Huh?

307
00:17:30,721 --> 00:17:32,582
Oh! Ohh!

308
00:17:35,335 --> 00:17:38,505
Bye, buddy. Hope you find your dad.

309
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:40,464
Thanks, Mr. Narwhal.

310
00:17:41,298 --> 00:17:42,758
Bye.

311
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,850
Hey! What's your name?

312
00:18:35,886 --> 00:18:38,560
My name's buddy.

313
00:18:41,813 --> 00:18:43,106
Ohh!

314
00:18:45,608 --> 00:18:47,610
Does someone need a hug?

315
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:49,653
Raccoon chirping

316
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,366
aah, aah! That's not cool!

317
00:18:54,403 --> 00:18:55,414
Screech

318
00:18:55,451 --> 00:18:57,536
I just wanted a hug!

00:19:38,532 --> 00:19:40,095
Hi.

321

Hello.

00:19:48,124 --> 00:19:51,920
Thank you.

00:19:58,218 --> 00:20:01,392
You did it! Congratulations!

00:20:53,602 --> 00:20:56,022
Screaming

332
00:21:16,957 --> 00:21:19,001
Thank you. Hey, you know what?
No.

333
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:20,424
No, all right? Thank you.

334
00:21:20,461 --> 00:21:23,005
Get outta here, get outta here.

335
00:21:42,773 --> 00:21:45,150
Elevator chimes

336
00:21:53,324 --> 00:21:55,159
Elevator chimes

337
00:21:57,787 --> 00:21:59,935
Hello. Hi.

338
00:21:59,972 --> 00:22:02,083
Ooh...

339
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:08,046
Gasps beautiful.

340
00:22:18,263 --> 00:22:20,808
Looks like a Christmas tree.

341
00:22:22,101 --> 00:22:24,150
A reprint?

342
00:22:24,186 --> 00:22:26,063
You know how much that's gonna
cost?

343
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,236
Two whole pages are missing.

344
00:22:27,272 --> 00:22:28,487
The story doesn't make any sense.

345
00:22:28,523 --> 00:22:30,775
What, you think some kid's gonna
notice two pages?

346
00:22:30,812 --> 00:22:33,028
I mean, they... all they do is look
at pictures.

347
00:22:33,065 --> 00:22:34,617
Elevator chimes gasps

348
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:37,344
Sorry I can't ride with you the
Rest of the way up,

349
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,034
But this is where my dad works.
Well, have a good...

350
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,248
Oh, I forgot to give you a hug!

351
00:22:41,285 --> 00:22:43,246
Oh, I don't know, Connie,
I've never

352
00:22:43,283 --> 00:22:44,706
Declared kittens before.

353
00:22:44,742 --> 00:22:45,996
How many?

354
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,213
Gasps eight?

355
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,131
Uh, I don't know if I'm gonna
Have time.

356
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,628
Oh, all right, just bring 'em by
The camper this week,

357
00:22:51,664 --> 00:22:54,089
And I'll see what I can do. I'm
Not gonna charge you.

358
00:22:54,126 --> 00:22:56,591
Just bring ‘em by, and I'll see
What I can do.

359
00:22:56,628 --> 00:22:58,306
I have to go. Excuse me.

360
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:01,721
I'm here to see a Walter hobs.

361
00:23:01,758 --> 00:23:03,186
I'm buddy the elf. Laughs

362
00:23:03,223 --> 00:23:06,809
You look hilarious! Who sent you?

363
00:23:06,846 --> 00:23:08,774
Papa elf. Papa elf?

364
00:23:08,811 --> 00:23:10,521
Mm-hmm. From the North Pole.

365
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,194
From the North Pole? Yes.

366
00:23:12,231 --> 00:23:14,941
So, you really think we should
Ship 'em?

367
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:17,316
No, I think we should take a
$30,000 bath

368
00:23:17,352 --> 00:23:19,654
So some kid can understand
What happened?

369
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:21,322
To a puppy and a frigging pigeon

370
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,617
ship 'em. Phone rings

371
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:25,081
Yeah.

372
00:23:25,118 --> 00:23:27,828
Mr. Hobbs? It's me on the intercom.

373
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:28,251
Go ahead.

374
00:23:28,287 --> 00:23:31,874
Yeah, I think some one sent you a
Christmas-gram.

375
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:34,585
Dad!

376
00:23:36,378 --> 00:23:37,634
Chuckles

377
00:23:37,671 --> 00:23:40,486
All right, uh, let's get it
Over with.

378
00:23:40,523 --> 00:23:43,265
I walked all day and night to
Find you.

379
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:46,221
Uh, you look like you came from
the North Pole.

380
00:23:46,257 --> 00:23:46,727
Chuckle

381
00:23:46,763 --> 00:23:48,890
That's exactly where I came from.

382
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,576
Santa must've called you!

383
00:23:50,613 --> 00:23:52,189
Oh, yeah, sure, he, uh...

384
00:23:52,226 --> 00:23:54,144
Just got off the cell phone
with me.

385
00:23:54,181 --> 00:23:55,401
You did?!

386
00:23:55,437 --> 00:23:57,862
So, go on. Go on with what?

387
00:23:57,898 --> 00:24:00,150
Well, are... are you gonna sing a
Song or something,

388
00:24:00,187 --> 00:24:01,902
Or can I just go back to work?

389
00:24:01,939 --> 00:24:04,784
A song? Uh...

390
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:10,222
Yeah. Anything for you, dad, uh...

391
00:24:10,258 --> 00:24:15,623
I... I'm, I'm here with my dad

392
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,379
And we never met

393
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:20,251
And he wants me to sing
Him a song

394
00:24:20,288 --> 00:24:21,759
And, um, I was adopted

395
00:24:21,796 --> 00:24:24,136
But you didn't know I was born

396
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:28,635
So, I'm here now, I found you,
Daddy

397
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,929
And, guess what? I love you

398
00:24:30,965 --> 00:24:34,724
I love you I love you!

399
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:37,940
Wow, that was weird.

400
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,813
You know, usually you guys just
Uh, you know,

401
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:43,649
Put my name into jingle bells or
something.

402
00:24:43,686 --> 00:24:44,405
It's me, your son.

403
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:47,695
Susan wells had me, and... And she
Didn't tell you,

404
00:24:47,731 --> 00:24:50,197
And, and, and, but now I'm here...

405
00:24:50,234 --> 00:24:51,445
It's me buddy.

406
00:24:51,481 --> 00:24:52,620
Susan wells.

407
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,952
Uh, you said Susan wells? Yes.

408
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,209
Who sent this Christmas-gram?

409
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,378
What's a Christmas-gram?
I want one.

410
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,958
Whispering I think we
should call security.

411
00:25:02,995 --> 00:25:03,797
Good idea.

412
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:05,216
I like to whisper, too.

413
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,713
It's okay, Walter's my father.

414
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,173
Well, your dad's busy right now.

415
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,389
Okay, I'll come back later.

416
00:25:11,425 --> 00:25:12,926
Yeah, you know, you're not gonna

417
00:25:12,963 --> 00:25:13,974
Come back for awhile, okay?

418
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,971
You're gonna go back to
Santa land.

419
00:25:16,008 --> 00:25:16,434
Okay.

420
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:19,724
Yeah, why don't you go back?
to gimbals'?

421
00:25:27,982 --> 00:25:30,735
("Sleigh Ride" playing)

422
00:25:37,907 --> 00:25:40,493
Sorry! Sorry.

423
00:25:52,796 --> 00:25:55,152
Passion fruit spray?

424
00:25:55,188 --> 00:25:57,508
Fruit spray? Sure.

425
00:25:59,386 --> 00:26:01,763
Crying

426
00:26:14,274 --> 00:26:15,902
Sorry.

427
00:26:18,737 --> 00:26:20,030
Sorry.

428
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:26,327
Do you wanna go?

429
00:26:39,048 --> 00:26:40,554
Toilet flushes

430
00:26:40,591 --> 00:26:43,302
Hey! Have you seen these?
toilets?

431
00:26:43,338 --> 00:26:45,971
They're gl-normous!

432
00:26:46,888 --> 00:26:49,848
"For that special someone."

433
00:26:53,061 --> 00:26:54,458
Past!

434
00:26:54,494 --> 00:26:55,818
Grunts

435
00:26:55,855 --> 00:26:58,441
Hey, come... come here!

436
00:26:58,477 --> 00:27:01,318
Me? Yes.

437
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:06,036
What are you doing down here?

438
00:27:06,073 --> 00:27:08,866
You're not supposed to be
Down here!

439
00:27:08,903 --> 00:27:10,040
You can shop on your break,

440
00:27:10,076 --> 00:27:11,916
You don't... come on, get upstairs!

441
00:27:11,953 --> 00:27:14,790
Okay, I didn't know. Well
You should know!

442
00:27:14,826 --> 00:27:15,795
Are you mad at me? No.

443
00:27:15,832 --> 00:27:17,417
Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure.

444
00:27:17,454 --> 00:27:18,770
Just do your job.

445
00:27:18,807 --> 00:27:20,086
Okay, fair enough.

446
00:27:20,123 --> 00:27:21,835
Gasps wow!

447
00:27:21,872 --> 00:27:23,510
What's this?

448
00:27:23,547 --> 00:27:25,236
This is the North Pole.

449
00:27:25,273 --> 00:27:27,621
No, it's not. Yes, it is.

450
00:27:27,658 --> 00:27:31,518
No, it isn't. Yes, it is.

451
00:27:31,555 --> 00:27:34,474
No, it's not. Where's the snow?

452
00:27:35,057 --> 00:27:35,980
Why you smiling like that?

453
00:27:36,017 --> 00:27:38,525
I just like to smile, smiling's
my favorite.

454
00:27:38,561 --> 00:27:41,314
Make work your favorite, that's
You're favorite, okay?

455
00:27:41,351 --> 00:27:43,150
Okay. Work is your new favorite.

456
00:27:43,186 --> 00:27:43,779
Fine.

457
00:27:43,816 --> 00:27:45,568
It's time for the announcement.

458
00:27:45,605 --> 00:27:46,031
Okay.

459
00:27:46,068 --> 00:27:49,113
Okay, people, tomorrow
morning 10 A.M.,

460
00:27:49,149 --> 00:27:50,613
Santa's coming' to town!

461
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,079
Santa!

462
00:27:52,116 --> 00:27:53,539
Oh, my god!

463
00:27:53,575 --> 00:27:57,996
Santa here?! I know him.

464
00:27:58,033 --> 00:27:58,835
I know him.

465
00:27:58,872 --> 00:28:00,332
He'll be hereto take pictures

466
00:28:00,368 --> 00:28:01,833
With all the children.

467
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:02,297
Yeah!

468
00:28:02,334 --> 00:28:04,961
Just keep your receipts.
10 A.M. Tomorrow.

469
00:28:04,998 --> 00:28:05,925
10 A.M. Tomorrow.

470
00:28:05,961 --> 00:28:07,050
Santa's coming to town.

471
00:28:07,087 --> 00:28:09,131
Yes. Can you sign this for me?

472
00:28:09,168 --> 00:28:11,847
Ohh! Hi.

473
00:28:11,884 --> 00:28:14,845
Whispers Santa's coming.

474
00:28:33,528 --> 00:28:34,660
Are you enjoying the view?

475
00:28:34,697 --> 00:28:37,949
You are very good at decorating
that tree.

476
00:28:37,986 --> 00:28:39,969
Why are you messing with me?

477
00:28:40,006 --> 00:28:41,953
Did Krumpet put you up to this?

478
00:28:41,989 --> 00:28:43,376
I'm not messing with you.

479
00:28:43,412 --> 00:28:45,394
It's just nice to meet
Another human

480
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,924
Who shares my affinity for?
elf culture.

481
00:28:47,961 --> 00:28:50,419
I'm just trying to get
through the holidays.

482
00:28:50,456 --> 00:28:50,841
Get through?

483
00:28:50,878 --> 00:28:54,423
Christmas is the greatest
Day in the whole wide world!

484
00:28:54,459 --> 00:28:55,942
Please stop talking to me.

485
00:28:55,979 --> 00:28:57,389
Uh-oh. Sounds like someone

486
00:28:57,426 --> 00:28:59,595
Needs to sing a Christmas
Carol.

487
00:28:59,631 --> 00:29:00,100
Go away.

488
00:29:00,136 --> 00:29:01,930
The best way to
Spread Christmas cheer

489
00:29:01,967 --> 00:29:03,598
Is singing loud for all to hear.

490
00:29:03,635 --> 00:29:04,687
Thanks, but I don't sing.

491
00:29:04,724 --> 00:29:07,185
Oh, it's easy, it's just like
Talking...

492
00:29:07,222 --> 00:29:08,107
Except louder and longer

493
00:29:08,144 --> 00:29:09,359
And you move your voice up
And down.

494
00:29:09,396 --> 00:29:12,148
I can sing, but I just choose not

Well, if you sing alone,
You can sing

497
00:29:16,485 --> 00:29:18,113
In front of other people. There's
no difference.

498

Actually, there's a big difference.

No, there's not.

We sing all the time.
No, there's not.

00:37:56,385 --> 00:37:59,804
Ha ha! Where you going now?
Where you going?

658
00:38:00,514 --> 00:38:01,895
Cheering

659
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:05,059
Manager: Ohh! Ohh!

660
00:38:08,062 --> 00:38:09,897
No!

661
00:38:10,731 --> 00:38:12,863
Grunting

662
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,278
He's not Santa Claus!

663
00:38:16,315 --> 00:38:18,071
He's not Santa!

664
00:38:20,282 --> 00:38:22,033
"To someone special."

665
00:38:48,808 --> 00:38:50,977
What's that? Intercom.

666
00:38:51,014 --> 00:38:53,268
All right.

667
00:38:53,304 --> 00:38:55,523
Phone rings

668
00:38:55,772 --> 00:38:59,777
Yeah? Mr. Hobbs, the police are
On line one.

669
00:38:59,813 --> 00:39:02,571
Police. Hello?

670
00:39:02,608 --> 00:39:04,990
Chatter

671
00:39:21,046 --> 00:39:21,760
Dad!

672
00:39:21,797 --> 00:39:24,049
I knew that you'd come,
I love you for coming.

673
00:39:24,086 --> 00:39:25,611
Officer tom, this is my dad.

674
00:39:25,647 --> 00:39:27,135
This is Walter... he came.

675
00:39:27,172 --> 00:39:27,933
He bailed me out.

676
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:29,178
They gave me one phone call.

677
00:39:29,215 --> 00:39:30,352
They gave me one phone call,

678
00:39:30,389 --> 00:39:32,849
And I said, "I know who
I'm gonna call...

679
00:39:32,886 --> 00:39:33,522
Walter Hobbs."

680
00:39:33,558 --> 00:39:34,522
And sure enough, you showed up.

681
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:36,560
You did, they said you weren't
goanna show up.

682
00:39:36,597 --> 00:39:39,227
They told me so many times...
shh shh shh shh shh.

683
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:41,857
Just who the heck are you,
And what is your problem?

684
00:39:41,894 --> 00:39:43,984
I-I'm buddy, I'm your son.

685
00:39:44,021 --> 00:39:45,074
Wait, um...

686
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,966
Tell me, tell me, tell me, uh...

687
00:39:47,003 --> 00:39:48,822
Where'd you get this picture?

688
00:39:48,858 --> 00:39:51,408
Papa elf gave it to me.

689
00:39:52,326 --> 00:39:54,327
Listen... is this some kind a
game?

690
00:39:54,364 --> 00:39:55,888
What do you want, some money?

691
00:39:55,925 --> 00:39:57,376
No! I just wanted to meet you,

692
00:39:57,413 --> 00:40:00,625
And I thought you might Anna
Meet me.

693
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,881
Who wouldn't Anna meet you?

694
00:40:07,965 --> 00:40:10,446
I thought maybe we could make
Gingerbread houses,

695
00:40:10,483 --> 00:40:12,928
And eat cookie dough, and go
Ice skating, and...

696
00:40:12,964 --> 00:40:15,137
And maybe even hold hands.

697
00:40:15,174 --> 00:40:16,895
Uh-huh.

698
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:19,016
Come with me. Okay.

699
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,860
Okay. What have we got here?

700
00:40:38,451 --> 00:40:40,704
Buddy, don't eat those.

701
00:40:44,915 --> 00:40:46,042
Gasps

702
00:40:46,078 --> 00:40:47,131
Ohh!

703
00:40:47,168 --> 00:40:48,508
We got to really hurry up, Walter,

704
00:40:48,545 --> 00:40:51,172
'cause I'm double booked the
rest of the afternoon.

705
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:51,678
Am I sick?

706
00:40:51,714 --> 00:40:52,966
Yeah, but that's not why we're
Here.

707
00:40:53,002 --> 00:40:53,930
We're hereto do a test, come on.

708
00:40:53,966 --> 00:40:55,013
What kind test? Just a test to
Find out

709
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,177
If you're my son or not. Why am
I sitting on paper?

710
00:40:57,213 --> 00:40:59,197
Because it's sanitary for the
other patients.

711
00:40:59,234 --> 00:41:01,180
Now, sit still so I can do
the finger prick.

712
00:41:01,217 --> 00:41:02,804
Gasps finger prick!

713
00:41:02,841 --> 00:41:04,355
Ohh! It's cold.

714
00:41:04,392 --> 00:41:05,434
Yeah, just pleases it still,
Please?

715
00:41:05,471 --> 00:41:06,440
Okay, can I listen to your
necklace?

716
00:41:06,477 --> 00:41:08,062
No, you can't. Will you
Just sit still...

717
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:09,068
Why is there a skeleton?
over there?

718
00:41:09,105 --> 00:41:10,293
I don't know, Walter,
Could you please?

719
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,427
If I squint it looks like a
pirate flag.

720
00:41:11,464 --> 00:41:12,488
Could you please have him?
Sit still?

721
00:41:12,525 --> 00:41:13,985
Does he have a name? No,
He hasn't got a name.

722
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:14,949
I'm sorry, Ben, I am sorry.

723
00:41:14,985 --> 00:41:16,007
I have a lot of patients
waiting.

724
00:41:16,044 --> 00:41:17,600
Would you please it still?
Please.

725
00:41:17,636 --> 00:41:19,120
He got mad at me. Yes, he did.
He did.

726
00:41:19,157 --> 00:41:21,450
The sooner you sit still,
The sooner we can

727
00:41:21,487 --> 00:41:22,164
Get this mess over with.

728
00:41:22,201 --> 00:41:23,660
Okay. Then can we eat sugar
plums?

729
00:41:23,697 --> 00:41:25,083
You betcha... we'll eat sugar
Plums,

730
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,040
Have gingerbread houses,
And we'll even paint eggs.

731
00:41:28,077 --> 00:41:30,458
Well, paint eggs, that's Easter.

732
00:41:31,168 --> 00:41:34,466
Ow! Ohh...

733
00:41:34,503 --> 00:41:36,594
My finger has a heartbeat.

734
00:41:36,631 --> 00:41:39,424
It won't hurt so much after
a little.

735
00:41:39,461 --> 00:41:41,217
What's your name?

736
00:41:41,254 --> 00:41:42,892
Buddy.

737
00:41:42,928 --> 00:41:44,513
I'm Carolyn.

738
00:41:44,549 --> 00:41:45,972
Hi.

739
00:41:46,431 --> 00:41:48,141
What do you want for Christmas?

740
00:41:48,178 --> 00:41:49,188
A Suzy-talks-a-lot.

741
00:41:49,225 --> 00:41:51,978
I'll put in a good word with
the big man.

742
00:41:52,015 --> 00:41:53,902
Thanks. Your costume is pretty.

743
00:41:53,939 --> 00:41:57,232
Oh, it's not a costume.
I'm an elf.

744
00:41:57,269 --> 00:41:59,152
Well, technically, I'm a human,

745
00:41:59,188 --> 00:42:00,616
But I was raised by elves.

746
00:42:00,653 --> 00:42:04,031
Oh, I'm a human raised by humans.

747
00:42:04,068 --> 00:42:06,659
Hmm. Cool.

748
00:42:11,497 --> 00:42:13,998
Door opens so?

749
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:18,795
It's a boy... buddy's your son.

750
00:42:18,832 --> 00:42:20,426
That's very impossible.

751
00:42:20,463 --> 00:42:22,068
You... you saw that guy out there.

752
00:42:22,105 --> 00:42:23,577
He's... he's certifiably insane.

753
00:42:23,614 --> 00:42:25,014
He's probably just reverting

754
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:27,636
To a state of childlike
dependency.

755
00:42:27,673 --> 00:42:28,600
An elf?

756
00:42:28,637 --> 00:42:30,681
What he needs is to be nurtured.

757
00:42:30,718 --> 00:42:32,701
Oh, I see.

758
00:42:32,738 --> 00:42:34,648
So, um, uh...

759
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:36,373
You'd like me to breastfeed him?

760
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:38,025
Walter, just bring him home.

761
00:42:38,062 --> 00:42:39,194
Introduce him to Emily and
Michael,

762
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,445
And once... once he comes to
Terms with reality,

763
00:42:41,482 --> 00:42:44,610
He should drop the whole elf
Thing and move on with his life.

764
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:47,113
I mean, that's what I would do if
I was you.

765
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:50,700
Oh, my god! Walter, this is...

766
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:51,997
This is wonderful,

767
00:42:52,034 --> 00:42:53,889
You... you have another son.

768
00:42:53,926 --> 00:42:55,708
Wonderful. Oh, gosh, I...

769
00:42:55,745 --> 00:42:58,540
I guess I never really thought
of it that way.

770
00:42:58,577 --> 00:42:59,963
This is incredible, I...

771
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,252
You know, it's a little
complicated,

772
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,504
But it's nothing that we can't
handle.

773
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,970
Honey? What?

774
00:43:07,007 --> 00:43:10,009
He thinks he's an elf.

775
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,098
I'm sorry, what?

776
00:43:11,135 --> 00:43:13,804
He think she's a Christmas elf.

777
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:14,519
Oh, come on, Walter,

778
00:43:14,555 --> 00:43:18,725
I'm sure he doesn't actually
think he's an elf.

779
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:22,146
And then, I traveled through
the seven levels

780
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,651
Of the candy cane forest,

781
00:43:23,688 --> 00:43:27,823
Past the sea of swirly-twirly
gumdrops,

782
00:43:27,859 --> 00:43:33,530
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel.

783
00:43:51,047 --> 00:43:52,757
Ahh.

784
00:43:54,175 --> 00:43:57,886
So, where were you for the
last 30 years?

785
00:43:57,923 --> 00:43:58,767
The north pole.

786
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:01,494
Can you pass the maple syrup?
Please?

787
00:44:01,531 --> 00:44:05,380
I... I didn't put... it's
spaghetti.

788
00:44:05,417 --> 00:44:09,231
Oh, you know what? I think
I have some.

789
00:44:09,268 --> 00:44:10,649
Yes.

790
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,358
You like sugar, huh?

791
00:44:13,395 --> 00:44:15,152
Is there sugar in syrup?

792
00:44:15,189 --> 00:44:16,284
Yes.

793
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:17,577
Then yes.

794
00:44:17,614 --> 00:44:20,115
We elves try to stick to the
four main food groups

795
00:44:20,151 --> 00:44:26,205
Candy, candy canes, candy corns,
and syrup.

796
00:44:26,241 --> 00:44:29,874
So, will you be staying with us?
Then?

797
00:44:29,911 --> 00:44:31,048
You mean I can stay?

798
00:44:31,084 --> 00:44:32,591
Of course you can. Emily.

799
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,129
How... how long do you think
you'll be with us?

800
00:44:35,165 --> 00:44:37,629
I... I hadn't really planned
it out,

801
00:44:37,665 --> 00:44:40,056
But I was thinking, like...
forever.

802
00:44:40,092 --> 00:44:42,845
Emily? Can I just speak to you
for a minute

803
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:45,639
in the, uh, kitchen, please?

804
00:44:48,267 --> 00:44:50,435
Are you crazy? He cannot
stay here.

805
00:44:50,472 --> 00:44:52,567
Clearly he has some serious issues.

806
00:44:52,604 --> 00:44:54,856
We can't just throw him out in
the snow.

807
00:44:54,893 --> 00:44:56,692
Why not? He loves the snow.

808
00:44:56,728 --> 00:44:58,753
He's told me 15 times.

809
00:44:58,789 --> 00:45:00,778
Walter, he's your son.

810
00:45:01,696 --> 00:45:04,115
Belching

811
00:45:14,666 --> 00:45:16,334
Did you hear that?

812
00:45:17,669 --> 00:45:20,338
You are so weird.

813
00:45:22,257 --> 00:45:23,675
Dad?

814
00:45:26,677 --> 00:45:28,429
Dad?

815
00:45:29,305 --> 00:45:31,682
Dad! Door opens

816
00:45:32,391 --> 00:45:33,480
What?

817
00:45:33,517 --> 00:45:35,311
Whispering I can't go to sleep

818
00:45:35,347 --> 00:45:37,479
Unless I get tucked in.

819
00:45:37,515 --> 00:45:38,694
What?

820
00:45:38,731 --> 00:45:42,693
I can't go to sleep unless I
get tucked in.

821
00:45:42,984 --> 00:45:44,867
I am not gonna tuck you in.

822
00:45:44,904 --> 00:45:48,323
I... I promise I'll go right
to sleep.

823
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,950
Fine.

824
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:01,585
Tickle fight, tickle fight!
buddy, stop.

825
00:46:01,621 --> 00:46:03,754
Tickle fight. Tickle... stop
stop, stop.

826
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:05,339
Sorry.

827
00:46:06,172 --> 00:46:07,381
It's all right.

828
00:46:07,418 --> 00:46:08,171
Hey, uh...

829
00:46:08,208 --> 00:46:08,889
Clears throat

830
00:46:08,926 --> 00:46:11,385
You just lay there and go to
sleep.

831
00:46:11,422 --> 00:46:13,971
Okay.

832
00:46:14,847 --> 00:46:17,766
Dad? Hmm?

833
00:46:17,803 --> 00:46:20,685
I love you.

834
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:26,775
Okay. Go to sleep now.

835
00:46:31,238 --> 00:46:32,493
Well, this is really something.

836
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:36,868
I'm usually the one making
breakfast.

837
00:46:37,868 --> 00:46:40,871
That's good, that's good.

838
00:46:42,248 --> 00:46:43,873
Okay.

839
00:46:51,006 --> 00:46:52,715
Oh, that's good.

840
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:54,467
Good? Good.

841
00:46:54,503 --> 00:46:55,765
Good.

842
00:46:55,802 --> 00:46:58,726
So, did you, um...

843
00:46:58,763 --> 00:47:00,368
Did you sleep okay last night?

844
00:47:00,405 --> 00:47:01,938
Great. I got a full 40 minutes.

845
00:47:01,974 --> 00:47:05,270
And I had time to build that
rocking horse.

846
00:47:05,394 --> 00:47:09,481
Uh, oh, my gosh. You actually
made that?

847
00:47:09,517 --> 00:47:12,275
Where did you get all the wood?

848
00:47:21,993 --> 00:47:24,891
Good morning, honey. Good
morning, dad.

849
00:47:24,928 --> 00:47:27,789
Walter, buddy has made us
breakfast.

850
00:47:27,826 --> 00:47:29,750
Isn't that nice? Grunts

851
00:47:29,786 --> 00:47:32,082
And lunch.

852
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:34,342
Emily: Bye.

853
00:47:34,379 --> 00:47:35,301
So, dad, how many scoops?

854
00:47:35,338 --> 00:47:38,300
I'll stick with the coffee now,
thanks.

855
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:41,349
So, dad...

856
00:47:41,386 --> 00:47:43,059
I planned out our whole day.

857
00:47:43,096 --> 00:47:44,269
First, we'll make snow angels
for two hours,

858
00:47:44,306 --> 00:47:46,933
And then we'll go ice skating
and then we'll eat a whole roll

859
00:47:46,969 --> 00:47:49,018
Of tollhouse cookie dough as fast
as we can,

860
00:47:49,054 --> 00:47:51,353
And then, to finish, we'll snuggle.

861
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:54,023
I've got to go to work, buddy.

862
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,237
Oh, and another thing...

863
00:47:55,273 --> 00:47:57,066
If you're going to be staying
here,

864
00:47:57,103 --> 00:47:58,860
You should think about, you know,

865
00:47:58,897 --> 00:48:00,533
Getting rid of the costume.

866
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:01,909
But I've worn this my whole life.

867
00:48:01,946 --> 00:48:05,073
You're not in the North Pole any
longer.

868
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:07,368
You wanna make me happy, don't you?

869
00:48:07,405 --> 00:48:07,999
More than anything.

870
00:48:08,036 --> 00:48:12,873
Then, lose the tights. I mean,
as soon as possible.

871
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:14,496
As soon as possible?

872
00:48:14,533 --> 00:48:16,084
As soon as possible.

873
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,503
Okay.

874
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:20,505
Emily: I almost forgot...

875
00:48:20,541 --> 00:48:22,382
Aah! Aah!

876
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:27,011
Good morning.

877
00:48:27,595 --> 00:48:29,889
Cell phone rings

878
00:48:29,925 --> 00:48:31,478
Ring

879
00:48:31,515 --> 00:48:32,062
Walter here.

880
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:33,975
Gasps it worked, it's you.

881
00:48:34,012 --> 00:48:36,204
How'd you get this number?

882
00:48:36,241 --> 00:48:38,397
Emily left an emergency list.

883
00:48:38,434 --> 00:48:38,986
I see.

884
00:48:39,022 --> 00:48:40,650
And, uh, is this an emergency?

885
00:48:40,686 --> 00:48:41,821
There's a horrible noise

886
00:48:41,858 --> 00:48:44,861
Coming from the evil
box underneath the window.

887
00:48:44,898 --> 00:48:47,360
It sounds like this...

888
00:48:47,397 --> 00:48:49,787
Screeches and wails

889
00:48:49,823 --> 00:48:52,661
It's, uh, it's... it's not evil,
buddy,

890
00:48:52,697 --> 00:48:53,790
It's, uh, it's a radiator,

891
00:48:53,827 --> 00:48:56,142
And the heat makes noise when
it comes on.

892
00:48:56,178 --> 00:48:59,111
No, it doesn't. It... It's very
evil.

893
00:48:59,148 --> 00:49:02,639
It's scary to look at. It's...
okay...

894
00:49:02,676 --> 00:49:06,130
I'm going toward... oh, wait.
Yes, it is.

895
00:49:06,167 --> 00:49:07,840
Okay, it's okay. It's okay.

896
00:49:07,877 --> 00:49:08,755
Everything's fine.

897
00:49:08,792 --> 00:49:09,598
You were right.

898
00:49:09,634 --> 00:49:12,136
Okay, good, uh, I'm gonna hang
up now.

899
00:49:12,173 --> 00:49:12,976
I love you.

900
00:49:13,012 --> 00:49:14,702
I'll call you in five minutes.

901
00:49:14,738 --> 00:49:16,354
No, no, buddy, don't, uh...

902
00:49:16,391 --> 00:49:18,935
You... you don't have to call me
, okay?

903
00:49:18,971 --> 00:49:20,483
Good idea, you call me.

904
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,318
Okay. I'm gonna hang up now.

905
00:49:22,355 --> 00:49:24,189
I painted a picture of a
butterfly.

906
00:49:24,226 --> 00:49:26,483
Good. I'm gonna hang up now.

907
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,733
I tuned the piano.

908
00:49:28,769 --> 00:49:30,946
Okay, I love you. Bye.

909
00:49:30,982 --> 00:49:32,911
Mmm...

910
00:49:32,948 --> 00:49:34,532
Mmm... Mmm.

911
00:49:49,046 --> 00:49:50,547
Mmm.

912
00:49:50,584 --> 00:49:52,012
Sighs

913
00:49:52,049 --> 00:49:54,885
Hobbs. Hey!

914
00:49:55,135 --> 00:49:56,599
How you doing? Please, sit
down.

915
00:49:56,636 --> 00:49:58,930
I haven't seen you since
the retreat.

916
00:49:58,966 --> 00:49:59,853
You're looking good.

917
00:49:59,889 --> 00:50:01,307
Oh, thank you very much.
You as well.

918
00:50:01,344 --> 00:50:02,689
To what do I owe the, uh,
pleasure?

919
00:50:02,726 --> 00:50:06,103
Well, to be honest, I got a call
from my niece.

920
00:50:07,147 --> 00:50:07,943
She wants to know

921
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:11,712
How a certain puppy and a
certain pigeon

922
00:50:11,749 --> 00:50:15,445
Escape the clutches of a
certain evil witch.

923
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:17,536
Believe me, uh,

924
00:50:17,572 --> 00:50:19,079
We're already looking for new
printers.

925
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:21,660
This one has obviously gotten a
little sloppy.

926
00:50:21,696 --> 00:50:24,204
Maybe it isn't the printer who's
gotten sloppy.

927
00:50:24,241 --> 00:50:26,419
That's your signature, right?

928
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:29,459
You know, we could sit here and
point fingers all day.

929
00:50:29,495 --> 00:50:30,964
I've got news for you...

930
00:50:31,001 --> 00:50:33,503
Even if those two pages were
in there,

931
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:34,968
The book still would have sucked.

932
00:50:35,005 --> 00:50:37,277
Have you seen the numbers for
this quarter?

933
00:50:37,314 --> 00:50:39,551
Uh, they'll be here today. Oh,
they're in.

934
00:50:39,588 --> 00:50:41,470
That frigging puppy and pigeon

935
00:50:41,506 --> 00:50:42,684
Are tanking hard, Hobbs.

936
00:50:42,721 --> 00:50:44,680
My people estimate we're
gonna post

937
00:50:44,717 --> 00:50:46,478
A minus eight for this quarter.

938
00:50:46,515 --> 00:50:49,691
A minus eight! That does not
happen!

939
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:52,188
You know, we'll... we'll bounce
back, we...

940
00:50:52,224 --> 00:50:53,611
No, no, no. No? Well...

941
00:50:53,647 --> 00:50:55,733
We're gonna ship a new book

942
00:50:55,769 --> 00:50:57,147
The first quarter.

943
00:50:57,184 --> 00:50:58,489
First quarter?

944
00:50:58,526 --> 00:51:01,133
I'm gonna be back in town on
the 24th.

945
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:03,740
At that time, I would love
to hear

946
00:51:03,777 --> 00:51:05,497
In exact detail

947
00:51:05,534 --> 00:51:08,744
What your plans are for this
new book.

948
00:51:08,954 --> 00:51:12,665
Uh, wait a minute, the, uh
the 24th, that's Christmas eve.

949
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,465
And?

950
00:51:15,502 --> 00:51:17,424
And, uh...

951
00:51:17,461 --> 00:51:20,506
No problem. Be great to have
you in the loop.

952
00:51:20,543 --> 00:51:23,467
School bell rings

953
00:51:23,592 --> 00:51:26,637
Michael: All right, I got every
weapon in the game.

954
00:51:26,673 --> 00:51:29,138
I got full health, I got full
armor.

955
00:51:29,174 --> 00:51:29,977
Michael!

956
00:51:30,014 --> 00:51:31,140
I got full...

957
00:51:31,177 --> 00:51:32,272
Michael!

958
00:51:32,308 --> 00:51:34,269
It's me buddy!

959
00:51:35,061 --> 00:51:35,733
You know that guy?

960
00:51:35,769 --> 00:51:38,751
No, I've never seen him before.

961
00:51:38,788 --> 00:51:41,734
It's me buddy! Your brother!

962
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:43,074
Oh, man.

963
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:47,739
No, Michael! Wait! It's your
brother bud...

964
00:51:47,775 --> 00:51:48,620
Tires screech

965
00:51:48,656 --> 00:51:51,284
Sorry. Sorry! Horn honks

966
00:51:51,994 --> 00:51:54,662
Michael! Michael!

967
00:51:54,699 --> 00:51:56,460
Michael!

968
00:51:56,497 --> 00:51:58,833
Michael, wait up!

969
00:51:58,869 --> 00:52:00,436
Michael! Michael!

970
00:52:00,473 --> 00:52:01,966
Wow, you're fast.

971
00:52:02,002 --> 00:52:03,858
I'm glad I caught up with you.

972
00:52:03,895 --> 00:52:05,472
I waited five hours for you.

973
00:52:05,508 --> 00:52:07,012
Why is your coat so big?

974
00:52:07,049 --> 00:52:09,530
So, good news... I saw a dog
today.

975
00:52:09,567 --> 00:52:12,012
Have you seen a dog?
You probably have.

976
00:52:12,049 --> 00:52:13,726
How was school? Was it fun?

977
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:15,640
Did you get a lot of
homework, huh?

978
00:52:15,676 --> 00:52:16,910
Do you have any friends?

979
00:52:16,946 --> 00:52:18,400
Do you have a best friend?

980
00:52:18,436 --> 00:52:19,853
Does he have a big coat, too?

981
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:21,312
Go away!

982
00:52:22,688 --> 00:52:26,817
Ow! Son of a nutcracker!

983
00:52:29,653 --> 00:52:31,071
Run!

984
00:52:31,572 --> 00:52:35,034
Boy: Get him! Get the
green guy!

985
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:37,536
Boys cheering

986
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,792
Oh, no. These guys are bad news.

987
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:47,378
We better get outta here.

988
00:52:48,671 --> 00:52:51,178
You know what? We can take 'em.

989
00:52:51,215 --> 00:52:55,219
Okay, just start making as
many snowballs as you can.

990
00:53:02,308 --> 00:53:04,727
Grunts you ready?

991
00:53:05,645 --> 00:53:08,439
Let's go. Aah! Ow.

992
00:53:09,649 --> 00:53:11,067
Ow!

993
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:17,781
Boy: Run!

994
00:53:23,828 --> 00:53:25,412
Crying

995
00:53:25,788 --> 00:53:28,583
Michael: Oh, man. One got away.

996
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:29,876
Snowball.

997
00:53:38,258 --> 00:53:39,885
Kid: Unh!

998
00:53:40,678 --> 00:53:42,136
Wow.

999
00:53:42,763 --> 00:53:45,598
Where did you say you were from?

1000
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:47,815
Oh, yeah

1001
00:53:47,851 --> 00:53:50,562
Candles burning low

1002
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:53,236
Lots of mistletoe

1003
00:53:53,273 --> 00:53:59,074
Lots of snow and ice everywhere
we go

1004
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:04,658
Choirs singing carols right
outside my door

1005
00:54:04,695 --> 00:54:06,657
All these things and more

1006
00:54:06,694 --> 00:54:08,620
I wish dad were here.

1007
00:54:08,657 --> 00:54:08,876
Why?

1008
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:12,874
'Cause he's the greatest dad in
the whole wide world.

1009
00:54:12,911 --> 00:54:13,671
Are you kidding?

1010
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:16,294
He's the worst dad in the world.

1011
00:54:16,331 --> 00:54:18,106
What do you mean?

1012
00:54:18,142 --> 00:54:19,881
All he does is work.

1013
00:54:19,917 --> 00:54:21,262
Working's fun.

1014
00:54:21,298 --> 00:54:23,305
Not the way he does it.

1015
00:54:23,342 --> 00:54:24,348
All he cares about is money.

1016
00:54:24,384 --> 00:54:28,472
He doesn't care about you,
or me, or anybody.

1017
00:54:28,508 --> 00:54:31,308
Well, he is on the naughty list.

1018
00:54:35,936 --> 00:54:37,792
You like her?

1019
00:54:37,829 --> 00:54:39,649
Like who?

1020
00:54:39,815 --> 00:54:41,692
The girl you're staring at.

1021
00:54:41,729 --> 00:54:43,462
Oh, uh...

1022
00:54:43,498 --> 00:54:45,196
Yeah.

1023
00:54:46,488 --> 00:54:48,657
Why don't you ask her out?

1024
00:54:48,693 --> 00:54:49,621
Out?

1025
00:54:49,657 --> 00:54:52,744
You know, on a date...
to eat food.

1026
00:54:52,781 --> 00:54:53,624
Food?

1027
00:54:53,661 --> 00:54:56,378
Yes, real food, not candy.

1028
00:54:56,415 --> 00:54:59,063
And if she says yes,
you're in.

1029
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:01,710
It's like a secret code
girls have.

1030
00:55:03,338 --> 00:55:05,340
Well, look who it is.

1031
00:55:05,377 --> 00:55:08,468
Hi, Jovie. Hi.

1032
00:55:10,427 --> 00:55:12,221
Oh, uh, this is Michael.

1033
00:55:12,258 --> 00:55:13,847
I'm his brother.

1034
00:55:14,806 --> 00:55:15,812
Hi.

1035
00:55:15,848 --> 00:55:17,648
So, what are you doing here?

1036
00:55:17,684 --> 00:55:20,269
Did Gimbel’s give you your
job back?

1037
00:55:20,306 --> 00:55:22,855
No. But things worked out
pretty good.

1038
00:55:22,892 --> 00:55:24,899
They gave mea restraining
order.

1039
00:55:25,024 --> 00:55:28,986
Well, um, you should probably
get outta here.

1040
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,911
Ho ho ho!

1041
00:55:31,948 --> 00:55:34,163
But... I really wanted to
see you,

1042
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:38,286
And... and I think you're
beautiful, and I, um...

1043
00:55:38,323 --> 00:55:41,748
I feel really warm when I
am around you,

1044
00:55:41,785 --> 00:55:46,043
And, um, my tongue swells up.

1045
00:55:50,005 --> 00:55:52,258
So...

1046
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,760
Do you wanna go eat food?

1047
00:55:55,427 --> 00:55:57,721
Do I... do I wanna eat food?

1048
00:55:57,758 --> 00:55:58,685
Mm-hmm.

1049
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:04,018
You know, uh, the code... food.

1050
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:08,898
Well, I just had my lunch
break.

1051
00:56:09,274 --> 00:56:12,089
Oh, okay. I understand.

1052
00:56:12,125 --> 00:56:14,903
But I'm free on Thursday.

1053
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:17,328
Thursday! Thursday!

1054
00:56:17,364 --> 00:56:19,533
Come on. That'd be great.

1055
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:20,497
All right.

1056
00:56:20,534 --> 00:56:22,744
Buddy: Was that okay?

1057
00:56:22,781 --> 00:56:24,955
You did great, man.

1058
00:56:25,455 --> 00:56:26,831
What should we put on it
first?

1059
00:56:26,868 --> 00:56:28,205
Lights! Oh, good.

1060
00:56:28,242 --> 00:56:29,505
And then, after that?

1061
00:56:29,542 --> 00:56:32,420
Ornaments! Ornaments, okay.

1062
00:56:33,337 --> 00:56:34,886
What the hell's that?

1063
00:56:34,923 --> 00:56:36,757
Michael: A Christmas tree.

1064
00:56:36,794 --> 00:56:37,429
A Christmas tree?

1065
00:56:37,466 --> 00:56:40,594
Buddy chopped it down in
the park.

1066
00:56:41,345 --> 00:56:42,809
Emily.

1067
00:56:42,846 --> 00:56:45,432
I don't know what you're making
such a big deal about.

1068
00:56:45,469 --> 00:56:47,472
They were just having a
little fun.

1069
00:56:47,509 --> 00:56:49,440
Oh, fun? So felonies are
fun now?

1070
00:56:49,477 --> 00:56:52,272
I thought, see, felonies
were felonies.

1071
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:53,236
Okay, the tree thing was bad.

1072
00:56:53,273 --> 00:56:54,529
I'll get him to plant
another one.

1073
00:56:54,566 --> 00:56:57,172
But at least Michael is
happy for once.

1074
00:56:57,208 --> 00:56:59,742
What, uh, what's that supposed
to mean?

1075
00:56:59,779 --> 00:57:02,072
Well, I don't think it's any
secret, Walter,

1076
00:57:02,109 --> 00:57:04,366
That you haven't exactly been
there for him.

1077
00:57:04,403 --> 00:57:06,344
I'll tell you what, why don't
we just

1078
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,287
Pull him outta school and let
the, uh,

1079
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:09,585
Deranged elf man raise him?

1080
00:57:09,622 --> 00:57:12,457
Then they can have lots of
fun committing felonies.

1081
00:57:12,494 --> 00:57:15,543
How are we gonna get the star
on top?

1082
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,087
I got it.

1083
00:57:29,014 --> 00:57:30,103
I mean, what are we gonna do?

1084
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:32,309
We can't... we can't leave him
alone here.

1085
00:57:32,346 --> 00:57:34,811
He's gonna destroy the place.

1086
00:57:36,855 --> 00:57:37,569
Why don't you, um...

1087
00:57:37,606 --> 00:57:38,904
Why don't you take off tomorrow?

1088
00:57:38,941 --> 00:57:41,151
You know, and you could stay
home and watch him?

1089
00:57:41,187 --> 00:57:43,486
Oh, no. No, I can't stay home
tomorrow,

1090
00:57:43,523 --> 00:57:44,839
I have a budget meeting tomorrow.

1091
00:57:44,876 --> 00:57:46,746
Well, honey, I can't take off,

1092
00:57:46,783 --> 00:57:48,220
I'm one... one bad pitch away

1093
00:57:48,257 --> 00:57:49,622
From getting fired... one.

1094
00:57:49,659 --> 00:57:52,578
Well, I tell you what, I have
an idea then.

1095
00:57:52,615 --> 00:57:55,497
Why don't you take buddy to
work with you?

1096
00:57:58,416 --> 00:58:00,210
Elevator chimes

1097
00:58:02,838 --> 00:58:05,006
Hey, Walter. Morning, jack.

1098
00:58:05,043 --> 00:58:06,674
Morning, jack.

1099
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:08,223
Oh, good morning, Mr. Hobbs.

1100
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:09,807
Good morning, Sarah. Good
morning, Sarah.

1101
00:58:09,844 --> 00:58:12,888
That's a nice purple dress.
It's very purple-y

1102
00:58:12,924 --> 00:58:14,354
Francisco. How's it going, Mr.
Hobbs?

1103
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:18,477
Francisco, that's fun to say..."
Francisco."

1104
00:58:18,513 --> 00:58:19,726
Gasps

1105
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:20,901
Hi! Hi.

1106
00:58:20,938 --> 00:58:21,860
Do you remember me?

1107
00:58:21,897 --> 00:58:23,814
I do. I didn't recognize you.

1108
00:58:23,851 --> 00:58:25,733
I know, I'm in work clothes.

1109
00:58:29,237 --> 00:58:31,239
Thank you, Deborah.

1110
00:58:31,276 --> 00:58:32,245
Thanks, deb.

1111
00:58:32,282 --> 00:58:33,657
Deb, you have such a pretty face.

1112
00:58:33,694 --> 00:58:35,033
You should be on a Christmas card.

1113
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:37,494
You just made my day.

1114
00:58:45,335 --> 00:58:46,795
Eww.

1115
00:58:49,547 --> 00:58:50,720
Buddy. Hmm?

1116
00:58:50,757 --> 00:58:52,758
You don't have to drink that.

1117
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:54,261
Thank you.

1118
00:59:04,394 --> 00:59:06,396
Francisco.

1119
00:59:07,523 --> 00:59:10,066
Francisco.

1120
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:13,882
Francisco.

1121
00:59:13,918 --> 00:59:16,406
Buddy?

1122
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:18,532
Whispers am I too loud?

1123
00:59:18,569 --> 00:59:20,075
Just... just a little.

1124
00:59:20,112 --> 00:59:21,785
Sorry.

1125
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:28,338
Yes, bud?

1126
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:31,045
Why is your name on the desk?

1127
00:59:31,082 --> 00:59:33,218
I bought the desk.

1128
00:59:33,255 --> 00:59:36,049
My name's there so no one
steals it.

1129
00:59:37,884 --> 00:59:39,698
That's a joke, isn't it, dad?

1130
00:59:39,734 --> 00:59:42,333
Yeah, buddy, that's a joke.

1131
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,933
So, what are we gonna build?

1132
00:59:44,969 --> 00:59:46,272
No, uh, we don't do

1133
00:59:46,308 --> 00:59:48,018
That kind of work here, pal.

1134
00:59:48,055 --> 00:59:49,233
Phone rings

1135
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:51,522
Buddy the elf, what's your
favorite color?

1136
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:52,940
Put that down. Hello?

1137
00:59:52,977 --> 00:59:55,316
Hello? Dial tone

1138
00:59:56,568 --> 00:59:59,071
Please, don't touch anything.

1139
00:59:59,107 --> 01:00:00,530
Sorry.

1140
01:00:03,909 --> 01:00:05,368
Hey...

1141
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:09,225
Bud, have you... have you...

1142
01:00:09,262 --> 01:00:11,331
Have you ever seen a mailroom?

1143
01:00:11,368 --> 01:00:12,541
A mailroom? No.

1144
01:00:12,578 --> 01:00:13,756
No? No.

1145
01:00:13,793 --> 01:00:14,590
Oh, I mean, wow.

1146
01:00:14,627 --> 01:00:17,379
Wow... listen, it's a
place where mail

1147
01:00:17,416 --> 01:00:18,343
From all over the world
comes,

1148
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,091
Uh-huh. And they sort it
out there, see?

1149
01:00:21,127 --> 01:00:22,056
And you can touch it all,

1150
01:00:22,092 --> 01:00:23,927
And they put it in these
shiny bins.

1151
01:00:23,964 --> 01:00:25,433
Shiny bins? Right.

1152
01:00:25,469 --> 01:00:27,973
What do ya think? It
sounds great.

1153
01:00:28,009 --> 01:00:28,977
Good.

1154
01:00:29,014 --> 01:00:30,559
Can we go there?

1155
01:00:30,595 --> 01:00:31,313
Well, um...

1156
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:34,562
I gotta work here, maybe... maybe
you can work there.

1157
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:35,855
Okay, I'll work there.

1158
01:00:35,892 --> 01:00:38,362
Rap music playing

1159
01:00:38,398 --> 01:00:40,567
Oh, I don't think this is
the place

1160
01:00:40,604 --> 01:00:41,824
My dad was talking about.

1161
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,404
Is there a different mailroom?

1162
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,613
No. This is the only one.

1163
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:47,866
It's not very shiny.

1164
01:00:47,949 --> 01:00:51,958
Now... over here's the trench.

1165
01:00:51,995 --> 01:00:54,085
All the mail comes out that
shooter.

1166
01:00:54,122 --> 01:00:58,542
Scan and find the floor each
piece is moving to.

1167
01:00:58,579 --> 01:00:59,506
Put it in a canister

1168
01:00:59,543 --> 01:01:03,130
And shove it up the tube with
the same number.

1169
01:01:03,166 --> 01:01:04,587
You got that?

1170
01:01:04,624 --> 01:01:05,971
I think so.

1171
01:01:06,008 --> 01:01:08,968
This place reminds me of
Santa's workshop.

1172
01:01:09,005 --> 01:01:10,517
Except it smells like mushrooms,

1173
01:01:10,553 --> 01:01:13,557
And everyone looks like they
wanna hurt me.

1174
01:01:13,848 --> 01:01:15,850
Uh, greenway's coming in tomorrow,

1175
01:01:15,887 --> 01:01:17,439
So, what... what do we got?

1176
01:01:17,475 --> 01:01:19,520
Well, Morris and I have been
brainstorming,

1177
01:01:19,556 --> 01:01:21,981
And we've come up with what I
think

1178
01:01:22,018 --> 01:01:23,441
Is a pretty big idea.

1179
01:01:23,477 --> 01:01:23,904
Great, what?

1180
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:26,485
You're gonna love it, it's
fantastic.

1181
01:01:26,522 --> 01:01:27,449
What?

1182
01:01:27,486 --> 01:01:30,780
Okay, picture this...

1183
01:01:30,817 --> 01:01:34,075
We bring in miles finch.

1184
01:01:34,993 --> 01:01:36,577
The miles finch?

1185
01:01:36,614 --> 01:01:37,826
The golden ghost.

1186
01:01:37,863 --> 01:01:39,002
We bring him in!

1187
01:01:39,038 --> 01:01:41,916
He's written more classics than dr.
Seuss.

1188
01:01:41,952 --> 01:01:42,881
It ain't gonna be easy,

1189
01:01:42,917 --> 01:01:44,548
But I think it's worth a shot.

1190
01:01:44,584 --> 01:01:49,215
My two top writers, my crack team,
my fun squad...

1191
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:50,888
You came in here pitching me

1192
01:01:50,925 --> 01:01:53,469
The idea of hiring another writer?

1193
01:01:53,505 --> 01:01:54,515
Yeah.

1194
01:01:54,552 --> 01:01:56,721
Miles finch.

1195
01:01:59,432 --> 01:02:01,935
I like it. Chuckles

1196
01:02:03,101 --> 01:02:04,065
I like it.

1197
01:02:04,102 --> 01:02:06,146
Then I traveled through the seven
levels

1198
01:02:06,183 --> 01:02:07,110
Of the candy cane forest

1199
01:02:07,147 --> 01:02:11,443
And past the sea of swirly-twirly
gumdrops.

1200
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,909
Gasps ooh!

1201
01:02:13,946 --> 01:02:16,953
Wow... it's sucky.

1202
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:19,450
Ohh, it's wonderful. Yes!

1203
01:02:19,487 --> 01:02:21,912
That is marvelous how that...

1204
01:02:21,948 --> 01:02:23,668
Oh! (Laughs)

1205
01:02:23,704 --> 01:02:26,227
Oh, it's very sucky.

1206
01:02:26,264 --> 01:02:28,751
It's very... sucky.

1207
01:02:28,787 --> 01:02:30,049
Whoo.

1208
01:02:30,086 --> 01:02:31,962
So, how'd you get here?

1209
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:33,422
Work release.

1210
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:34,511
Mm.

1211
01:02:34,548 --> 01:02:37,096
Oh, syrup and coffee?

1212
01:02:37,133 --> 01:02:40,427
Why didn't I think of that? Can I
try some?

1213
01:02:40,464 --> 01:02:41,559
Be my guest.

1214
01:02:41,596 --> 01:02:44,536
Very generous of you.

1215
01:02:44,573 --> 01:02:47,476
Mmm. Gasps I love syrup.

1216
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,689
Ohh, I love it.

1217
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:54,905
Mmm...

1218
01:02:54,942 --> 01:02:57,735
You know, I know I sound like a
broken record,

1219
01:02:57,772 --> 01:02:58,700
But we are buddies.

1220
01:02:58,737 --> 01:03:00,990
You're my best friend, that's it.

1221
01:03:01,026 --> 01:03:01,702
You're my best friend.

1222
01:03:01,739 --> 01:03:04,451
You know, buddy, nobody around
here listens to me.

1223
01:03:04,487 --> 01:03:06,618
I got really good ideas. Yeah?
I believe it.

1224
01:03:06,655 --> 01:03:08,663
I know, I'm right, I listen to you.

1225
01:03:08,699 --> 01:03:09,585
You have great ideas.

1226
01:03:09,622 --> 01:03:11,498
I just try to go with the flow,
you know?

1227
01:03:11,535 --> 01:03:12,663
Good, you go with the flow.

1228
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:13,756
Yeah. Go with the flow.

1229
01:03:13,793 --> 01:03:15,169
No, I gotta get out of the flow.

1230
01:03:15,205 --> 01:03:16,509
Well, then get out of the flow.

1231
01:03:16,545 --> 01:03:17,717
I'm in the flow, that's what got
me here.

1232
01:03:17,754 --> 01:03:21,175
I gotta... I'm 26 years old, I got
nothing to show for it.

1233
01:03:21,211 --> 01:03:23,177
You're young. You're so young.

1234
01:03:23,214 --> 01:03:24,141
Sighs

1235
01:03:24,178 --> 01:03:24,975
My papa... yeah?

1236
01:03:25,012 --> 01:03:29,640
He didn't make master tinker till
he was 490,so...

1237
01:03:29,677 --> 01:03:32,018
Laughing

1238
01:03:32,518 --> 01:03:34,228
Four-hundred and ninety? Yeah.

1239
01:03:34,265 --> 01:03:35,693
Laughing

1240
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:40,697
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!

1241
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:44,237
My favorite book of yours has
gotta be Gus' pickles.

1242
01:03:44,274 --> 01:03:47,466
It's existential, yet it's so
accessible.

1243
01:03:47,503 --> 01:03:50,395
Uh, Mr. Finch, uh, Eugene Dupris
here.

1244
01:03:50,432 --> 01:03:53,288
It's a thrill just to be talking
to you

1245
01:03:53,325 --> 01:03:54,501
On our speakerphone.

1246
01:03:54,538 --> 01:03:56,540
Miles, um, so, what do you think?

1247
01:03:56,577 --> 01:03:57,504
Can you fly in tomorrow?

1248
01:03:57,541 --> 01:03:59,793
I'll give you five hours tomorrow,

1249
01:03:59,829 --> 01:04:01,008
Not a minute more.

1250
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:02,050
Oh, that's... that's great.

1251
01:04:02,086 --> 01:04:05,758
I'd like a black s500to receive
me at the airport.

1252
01:04:05,795 --> 01:04:07,551
I need the interior of that car

1253
01:04:07,587 --> 01:04:09,515
To be 71 degrees exactly.

1254
01:04:09,552 --> 01:04:11,304
We can do that.
Deborah: Mr. Hobbs?

1255
01:04:11,341 --> 01:04:13,056
There's a situation downstairs.

1256
01:04:13,093 --> 01:04:14,229
Finch: I'm sorry, what?

1257
01:04:14,265 --> 01:04:15,481
No, hold on, miles. Deb, hang up.

1258
01:04:15,517 --> 01:04:17,894
Finch: I do not hold. Do not put
me on hold.

1259
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:20,270
Deborah: We have a problem in the
mailroom.

1260
01:04:20,307 --> 01:04:21,151
What's going on?

1261
01:04:21,188 --> 01:04:23,189
Don't speak... Deborah, hang up!

1262
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:25,192
Finch: That's it, I'm gone. Miles!

1263
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:31,073
Finch: I'll be there tomorrow... 71
degrees.

1264
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:33,242
Deborah: Sir, chuck in the mailroom

1265
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,740
Needs to talk to you.

1266
01:04:34,777 --> 01:04:36,165
Chuck... what, chuck?

1267
01:04:36,202 --> 01:04:37,709
I mean, what could be going on
down there

1268
01:04:37,746 --> 01:04:39,789
That's so important you had to
interrupt me, what?

1269
01:04:39,825 --> 01:04:41,704
Whoomp, there it is! A little
louder

1270
01:04:41,741 --> 01:04:43,584
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

1271
01:04:43,621 --> 01:04:45,508
Whoomp! There it is

1272
01:04:45,544 --> 01:04:46,941
Upside down and inside out hey!

1273
01:04:46,978 --> 01:04:48,339
I'm 'bout to show all you folks

1274
01:04:48,376 --> 01:04:49,762
What it's all about hey!

1275
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:51,013
Time for me to get on the mike

1276
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:52,613
And make this mother of a party
hype

1277
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:54,269
I'm taking you back to the old
school

1278
01:04:54,305 --> 01:04:55,851
'cause I'm an old fool who's so cool

1279
01:04:55,887 --> 01:04:57,681
If you wanna get down, I'm gonna
show you the way

1280
01:04:57,718 --> 01:04:59,807
Whoomp, there it is, let me hear
you say

1281
01:04:59,844 --> 01:05:01,973
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

1282
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:04,057
Whoomp! There it is a little louder

1283
01:05:04,094 --> 01:05:06,106
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

1284
01:05:06,142 --> 01:05:07,773
Whoomp, there it is!

1285
01:05:07,809 --> 01:05:09,358
Door buzzer

1286
01:05:10,192 --> 01:05:10,614
Coming.

1287
01:05:10,651 --> 01:05:13,737
("You Make Me Feel So Young" playing)

1288
01:05:16,282 --> 01:05:17,700
Hi.

1289
01:05:17,736 --> 01:05:19,081
Wow.

1290
01:05:19,117 --> 01:05:20,869
You look miraculous.

1291
01:05:20,906 --> 01:05:22,243
So do you.

1292
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:23,543
Thank you.

1293
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:25,582
What would you like to do?

1294
01:05:25,619 --> 01:05:27,666
I got some ideas.

1295
01:05:31,754 --> 01:05:35,674
Just reach out in front of you and
and take a sip.

1296
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:39,136
Don't look. There you go.

1297
01:05:41,305 --> 01:05:42,763
Well?

1298
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:45,808
It tastes like a crappy cup
of coffee.

1299
01:05:45,845 --> 01:05:48,102
Chuckles no.

1300
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:51,361
It is a crappy cup of coffee.

1301
01:05:51,397 --> 01:05:53,863
No, it's the world's best cup
of coffee.

1302
01:05:53,899 --> 01:05:57,653
The trick is to not get your arm caught
in the door!

1303
01:05:57,689 --> 01:06:01,120
Also, never close your eyes' cause
then

1304
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:04,826
Okay, when you feel comfortable, you
just jump in!

1305
01:06:04,863 --> 01:06:06,583
Laughing what are you doing?

1306
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:09,664
I'm skipping. I'm skipping.
I'm skipping.

1307
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,709
Wait, wait, wait... one more, one more.

1308
01:06:12,745 --> 01:06:15,419
Now, look at the size of this one.

1309
01:06:20,925 --> 01:06:22,802
Come with me.

1310
01:06:23,635 --> 01:06:24,907
Watch out.
(Tires screech)

1311
01:06:24,944 --> 01:06:26,896
Yellow ones don't stop.

1312
01:06:26,933 --> 01:06:28,848
The yellow ones don't stop.

1313
01:06:34,311 --> 01:06:38,441
Wow... that's a big one.

1314
01:06:59,211 --> 01:07:00,544
I'm sorry.

1315
01:07:00,581 --> 01:07:01,843
You missed.

1316
01:07:01,879 --> 01:07:03,840
What do you mean I missed?

1317
01:07:03,876 --> 01:07:05,340
You missed.

1318
01:07:14,516 --> 01:07:16,685
Elevator chimes

1319
01:07:25,192 --> 01:07:28,404
Miles finch.

1320
01:07:30,322 --> 01:07:32,241
Miles finch.

1321
01:07:34,785 --> 01:07:36,166
All right, let's do this.

1322
01:07:36,202 --> 01:07:38,538
Miles, I'm so happy you could come
Uh...

1323
01:07:38,575 --> 01:07:38,876
Yeah.

1324
01:07:38,913 --> 01:07:41,561
I'm Walter Hobbs. Yeah, let's get
the, uh...

1325
01:07:41,598 --> 01:07:44,210
Taken care of so we can get started
here.

1326
01:07:44,247 --> 01:07:45,920
Here you go.

1327
01:07:47,504 --> 01:07:48,886
Finch: Great.

1328
01:07:48,923 --> 01:07:51,404
All right... clears throat

1329
01:07:51,441 --> 01:07:53,886
What have you guys got so far?

1330
01:07:53,923 --> 01:07:55,218
Go ahead.

1331
01:07:55,255 --> 01:07:56,477
Uh...

1332
01:07:56,513 --> 01:07:59,766
We were thinking, uh, something
like this, uh...

1333
01:07:59,802 --> 01:08:01,731
We open on a young tomato.

1334
01:08:01,768 --> 01:08:03,895
He's had some tough times down
at the farm

1335
01:08:03,932 --> 01:08:05,772
With, you know, a rabbit, and...

1336
01:08:05,808 --> 01:08:07,354
No. No tomatoes...

1337
01:08:07,391 --> 01:08:08,864
Too vulnerable.

1338
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:10,443
Kids, they're already vulnerable.

1339
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,171
No, you see? I... I told you guys.

1340
01:08:12,207 --> 01:08:13,863
I told them the very same thing...

1341
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:14,493
And no farms.

1342
01:08:14,529 --> 01:08:16,969
Every body's pushing small town
rural.

1343
01:08:17,005 --> 01:08:19,409
A farm book would just be white
noise.

1344
01:08:19,446 --> 01:08:20,248
What about this?

1345
01:08:20,285 --> 01:08:23,251
Uh, a tribe of asparagus children,

1346
01:08:23,288 --> 01:08:27,917
But they're self-conscious about
the way their pee smells.

1347
01:08:32,422 --> 01:08:34,965
Apparently, all we have is
vegetables.

1348
01:08:35,001 --> 01:08:36,235
I have no time, so, you know,

1349
01:08:36,271 --> 01:08:37,431
If you've got a story here...

1350
01:08:37,468 --> 01:08:40,303
I've got about five or six great
starts here.

1351
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:42,348
I've got one idea that
I'm especially

1352
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:44,576
Psyched out of my mind about.

1353
01:08:44,613 --> 01:08:46,461
You know, it's one of those ideas

1354
01:08:46,498 --> 01:08:48,311
Where you're just like, uh...

1355
01:08:48,347 --> 01:08:49,234
Yes!

1356
01:08:49,271 --> 01:08:51,445
Whoa! Chuckling

1357
01:08:51,481 --> 01:08:53,863
Uh, great, c-could we hear it?

1358
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:57,278
I'll start with the cover.
Picture this... you got, uh

1359
01:08:57,315 --> 01:09:00,048
Dad! I'm in love, I'm in love,

1360
01:09:00,085 --> 01:09:02,783
And I don't care who knows it!

1361
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:03,456
Buddy, not now, uh,

1362
01:09:03,492 --> 01:09:05,786
Can you please go back to the...
to the pit?

1363
01:09:05,823 --> 01:09:08,080
I'll come and visit you in a
little while, okay?

1364
01:09:08,116 --> 01:09:11,546
I didn't know you had elves
working here.

1365
01:09:11,583 --> 01:09:16,504
Oh... boy, you're... you're hilarious,
my friend.

1366
01:09:16,541 --> 01:09:18,761
He doesn't, uh... get back to

1367
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:21,467
The story, please. All right, okay.

1368
01:09:21,503 --> 01:09:22,556
Clears throat

1369
01:09:22,593 --> 01:09:24,058
So, on the cover above the title...

1370
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:26,451
Does Santa know that you left the
workshop?

1371
01:09:26,488 --> 01:09:28,771
You know, we're all laughing our
heads off.

1372
01:09:28,808 --> 01:09:30,935
Did you have to borrow a reindeer
to get down here?

1373
01:09:30,971 --> 01:09:32,811
Buddy... go back to the basement.

1374
01:09:32,848 --> 01:09:34,317
Finch: Hey, jack weed,

1375
01:09:34,354 --> 01:09:35,944
I get more action in a week

1376
01:09:35,981 --> 01:09:37,320
Than you've had your entire life.

1377
01:09:37,357 --> 01:09:40,985
I've got houses in I.e., Paris,
and Vail,

1378
01:09:41,022 --> 01:09:42,366
Oh. Each one of them

1379
01:09:42,403 --> 01:09:44,405
with a 70-inchplasma screen.

1380
01:09:44,442 --> 01:09:45,869
So, I suggest you wipe

1381
01:09:45,906 --> 01:09:47,288
That stupid smile off your face

1382
01:09:47,325 --> 01:09:49,869
Before I come over there and smack
it off!

1383
01:09:49,905 --> 01:09:51,537
You feeling strong, my friend?!

1384
01:09:51,573 --> 01:09:54,999
Call me elf one more time!

1385
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,838
Whispers he's an angry elf.

1386
01:10:04,548 --> 01:10:07,427
Growling look at you.

1387
01:10:09,386 --> 01:10:11,347
Ow! Hey, what...

1388
01:10:11,383 --> 01:10:12,102
Aah!

1389
01:10:12,139 --> 01:10:13,849
I wasn't ready for that.

1390
01:10:13,885 --> 01:10:16,140
Aah! Hey, hey, hey!

1391
01:10:16,177 --> 01:10:18,395
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa!

1392
01:10:18,432 --> 01:10:18,859
Ooh...

1393
01:10:18,896 --> 01:10:20,856
Call me elf one more time!

1394
01:10:20,892 --> 01:10:22,625
Call me elf!

1395
01:10:22,662 --> 01:10:24,358
You're an elf.

1396
01:10:27,403 --> 01:10:29,363
Glass shatters

1397
01:10:29,697 --> 01:10:33,408
Miles, I'm sorry, he... he thinks
he's an elf.

1398
01:10:34,368 --> 01:10:35,165
Listen, miles...

1399
01:10:35,202 --> 01:10:37,704
Listen, miles! Door slams

1400
01:10:37,741 --> 01:10:40,208
He must be a South Pole elf.

1401
01:10:42,542 --> 01:10:44,231
You get the hell outta here.

1402
01:10:44,268 --> 01:10:45,573
Where do you want me to go?

1403
01:10:45,610 --> 01:10:46,843
I don't care where you go.

1404
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,151
I don't care that you're an elf!

1405
01:10:48,188 --> 01:10:49,910
I don't care that you're nuts!

1406
01:10:49,947 --> 01:10:51,634
I don't care that you're my son!

1407
01:10:51,671 --> 01:10:54,595
Get out of my life now!

1408
01:11:05,022 --> 01:11:06,028
Emily: Hi, it's me.

1409
01:11:06,064 --> 01:11:07,570
I really can't talk right now.

1410
01:11:07,607 --> 01:11:09,907
Well, just tell me how the pitch
went.

1411
01:11:09,943 --> 01:11:12,695
I'm gonna be a little later than
I thought, okay?

1412
01:11:12,732 --> 01:11:14,948
Well, don't be too late, Walter,

1413
01:11:14,984 --> 01:11:16,717
It's Christmas Eve.

1414
01:11:16,754 --> 01:11:18,414
Walter... wait, um.

1415
01:11:18,451 --> 01:11:20,578
Honey, I gotta go, okay? Love ya.

1416
01:11:20,614 --> 01:11:22,747
Oh, say hi to buddy.

1417
01:11:23,623 --> 01:11:25,212
What? Walter, breakthrough.

1418
01:11:25,249 --> 01:11:27,459
We found this in the conference
room.

1419
01:11:27,495 --> 01:11:27,923
What is it?

1420
01:11:27,959 --> 01:11:29,883
It's miles finch's notebook.

1421
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,090
This thing is chock full of
genius ideas.

1422
01:11:33,126 --> 01:11:33,719
I mean, look at that.

1423
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:37,635
And his best idea is about a
peach that lives on a farm.

1424
01:11:37,672 --> 01:11:39,929
What's more vulnerable than a
peach?

1425
01:11:39,965 --> 01:11:40,559
What, uh, what do we do?

1426
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:43,932
I think we should go with the
first pitch... it's genius.

1427
01:11:43,969 --> 01:11:44,563
Uh, how much time we got?

1428
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,476
We got, like, 45 minutes. Well,
come on, let's, uh,

1429
01:11:46,513 --> 01:11:48,479
Try to get a storyboard or
something ready.

1430
01:11:48,515 --> 01:11:49,692
Come on, let's do it. Just try.

1431
01:11:49,729 --> 01:11:52,232
No, you can't sit down and get a
storyboard ready.

1432
01:11:52,269 --> 01:11:53,774
Go and get a storyboard ready.

1433
01:11:53,811 --> 01:11:56,027
Oh, boy! Go.

1434
01:11:58,654 --> 01:12:02,205
"I'm sorry I ruined your lives

1435
01:12:02,242 --> 01:12:07,127
"And crammed 11 cookies into
the VCR.

1436
01:12:07,163 --> 01:12:12,585
"I don't belong here. I don't
belong anywhere.

1437
01:12:13,002 --> 01:12:18,548
I'll never forget you. Love,
buddy."

1438
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,008
God...

1439
01:12:31,144 --> 01:12:32,644
Hey, buddy.

1440
01:12:35,272 --> 01:12:36,731
Buddy?

1441
01:12:42,654 --> 01:12:44,697
As you know, we need a big
launch fast

1442
01:12:44,734 --> 01:12:46,036
To get the company back on
track.

1443
01:12:46,073 --> 01:12:49,327
So, I think I speak for my fellow
board members

1444
01:12:49,364 --> 01:12:52,494
When I say... this better be good.

1445
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:55,078
Before I get into the story, uh,

1446
01:12:55,114 --> 01:12:57,626
Let me start with the cover, okay?

1447
01:12:57,663 --> 01:12:59,938
Now, just picture this...

1448
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:01,886
Dad! I gotta talk to you.

1449
01:13:01,923 --> 01:13:03,799
Walter: Michael, what is it?

1450
01:13:03,835 --> 01:13:05,013
Buddy ran away.

1451
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:07,447
What? He... he left a note.

1452
01:13:07,484 --> 01:13:09,809
I'm scared, dad, he's gone.

1453
01:13:09,845 --> 01:13:12,186
Uh, let me just finish this
meeting,

1454
01:13:12,223 --> 01:13:15,705
And then, um, we'll figure it
out, okay?

1455
01:13:15,741 --> 01:13:19,188
Figure out what? Buddy cares
about everybody.

1456
01:13:19,224 --> 01:13:21,357
All you care about is yourself.

1457
01:13:23,067 --> 01:13:25,568
Hey, Michael.

1458
01:13:26,236 --> 01:13:27,737
Wait.

1459
01:13:31,032 --> 01:13:34,536
We're gonna have to reschedule
this, uh, Mr. Greenway.

1460
01:13:34,573 --> 01:13:35,951
We don't have time to reschedule.

1461
01:13:35,987 --> 01:13:37,330
I wanna hear the damn thing now.

1462
01:13:37,366 --> 01:13:38,503
Son, you'll have to wait.

1463
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:42,543
No, d-don't tell my kid what
to do, uh...

1464
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:46,088
Can't... can't we do this another
time, Mr. Greenway?

1465
01:13:46,125 --> 01:13:48,882
I flew in just to hear this pitch,

1466
01:13:48,918 --> 01:13:50,180
And I intend to.

1467
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:51,680
It's gonna have to wait.

1468
01:13:51,717 --> 01:13:53,725
If you wanna keep your job, Hobbs,

1469
01:13:53,761 --> 01:13:56,722
You will pitch me this book
right now.

1470
01:14:03,728 --> 01:14:06,773
Well... up yours.

1471
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:09,818
Yeah, up yours. Hey.

1472
01:14:11,236 --> 01:14:12,742
Hobbs... Hobbs!

1473
01:14:12,779 --> 01:14:14,536
Hobbs, you walk out of here,

1474
01:14:14,573 --> 01:14:17,117
And... and you're finished at
greenway!

1475
01:14:17,154 --> 01:14:18,659
You're finished!

1476
01:14:35,884 --> 01:14:38,887
I don't belong anywhere.

1477
01:14:41,139 --> 01:14:45,106
Buddy!

1478
01:14:45,143 --> 01:14:47,312
Buddy, where are you?!

1479
01:14:54,776 --> 01:14:59,155
Prancer, pull! Come on! Come on!

1480
01:14:59,192 --> 01:15:02,742
Vixen, up, up!

1481
01:15:02,779 --> 01:15:04,869
Santa?

1482
01:15:05,286 --> 01:15:08,289
Come on, you can do it.

1483
01:15:08,326 --> 01:15:11,918
Pull up! Pull up!

1484
01:15:19,758 --> 01:15:21,806
Dad! What?

1485
01:15:21,842 --> 01:15:23,345
Michael, where you going?

1486
01:15:23,382 --> 01:15:24,721
Michael!

1487
01:15:42,863 --> 01:15:43,202
Santa.

1488
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:47,951
Back off, slick. You'll scare
the deer.

1489
01:15:47,987 --> 01:15:50,702
Buddy, is that you?

1490
01:15:50,739 --> 01:15:51,667
Are you okay?

1491
01:15:51,704 --> 01:15:54,253
Boy, am I glad to see you.

1492
01:15:54,290 --> 01:15:58,210
The Claus meter suddenly just
dropped down to zero.

1493
01:15:58,247 --> 01:16:01,839
There's just no Christmas
spirit anymore.

1494
01:16:01,876 --> 01:16:04,860
And then the strain was too
Much...

1495
01:16:04,897 --> 01:16:07,844
The engine broke free of her
mounts.

1496
01:16:12,807 --> 01:16:15,356
I need an elf's help.

1497
01:16:15,393 --> 01:16:17,895
I... I'm not an elf, Santa.

1498
01:16:17,932 --> 01:16:20,361
I... I can't do anything right.

1499
01:16:20,397 --> 01:16:25,235
Buddy, you're more of an elf than
anyone I ever met,

1500
01:16:25,272 --> 01:16:27,630
And the only one who I would want

1501
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:29,990
Working on my sleigh tonight.

1502
01:16:30,027 --> 01:16:31,913
Really? Really.

1503
01:16:31,949 --> 01:16:34,576
Will you fix it for me, buddy?

1504
01:16:34,613 --> 01:16:37,204
I'll try. Papa taught me how.

1505
01:16:37,241 --> 01:16:38,002
You gotta find it first.

1506
01:16:38,038 --> 01:16:40,833
It dropped off the sleigh back
over there a ways.

1507
01:16:40,869 --> 01:16:43,753
The engine? The engine, yeah.

1508
01:16:43,790 --> 01:16:46,881
Go, buddy. Go, Mr. Elf!

1509
01:16:46,917 --> 01:16:48,220
Chuckles

1510
01:16:48,256 --> 01:16:49,888
I'm standing here outside
central park

1511
01:16:49,925 --> 01:16:53,470
Where it is unclear exactly
what has happened.

1512
01:16:53,507 --> 01:16:55,388
What we do know is that
authorities

1513
01:16:55,425 --> 01:16:56,227
Have closed the park

1514
01:16:56,264 --> 01:16:57,478
And are in the process of
clearing it.

1515
01:16:57,515 --> 01:17:00,268
The only thing that people can
seem to agree on here

1516
01:17:00,304 --> 01:17:03,771
Is that they saw something fall
from the sky.

1517
01:17:03,808 --> 01:17:04,986
I've got an eyewitness with me

1518
01:17:05,022 --> 01:17:07,232
Who claims to have seen the whole
thing firsthand.

1519
01:17:07,269 --> 01:17:08,406
What did you actually see?

1520
01:17:08,443 --> 01:17:10,986
You know, I was walking around and
I saw this thing,

1521
01:17:11,022 --> 01:17:13,280
And my daughter actually pointed
it out to me.

1522
01:17:13,317 --> 01:17:14,341
Oh, your daughter saw it?

1523
01:17:14,377 --> 01:17:15,328
Sweetheart, can you tell me

1524
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:17,743
What you saw falling out of the
sky?

1525
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:19,429
It was Santa's sleigh!

1526
01:17:19,466 --> 01:17:21,042
News woman chuckles

1527
01:17:21,079 --> 01:17:22,955
Santa's sleigh, well, there you
have it.

1528
01:17:22,991 --> 01:17:23,753
Santa's in Manhattan.

1529
01:17:23,790 --> 01:17:26,958
Sorry to interrupt your first big
news story, Charlotte,

1530
01:17:26,995 --> 01:17:29,145
But New York one has just received

1531
01:17:29,182 --> 01:17:31,282
Some exclusive amateur news footage

1532
01:17:31,318 --> 01:17:33,345
That you just might Anna follow
up on.

1533
01:17:33,381 --> 01:17:36,803
There seems to be a strange man
dressed as an elf

1534
01:17:36,839 --> 01:17:38,266
Wandering through central park.

1535
01:17:38,303 --> 01:17:41,306
Now, I don't know if this is the
kind of hard-hitting news

1536
01:17:41,343 --> 01:17:43,307
You're used to covering in buffalo,
Charlotte.

1537
01:17:43,344 --> 01:17:44,935
Oh, my god. But here at New York one,

1538
01:17:44,971 --> 01:17:47,437
News is top priority.

1539
01:17:57,946 --> 01:18:00,449
What the heck?

1540
01:18:00,485 --> 01:18:02,325
Hey!

1541
01:18:02,784 --> 01:18:05,495
You found it. Buddy!

1542
01:18:10,916 --> 01:18:12,376
I need to tell you something.

1543
01:18:12,412 --> 01:18:13,479
No, no. Buddy, there's something

1544
01:18:13,516 --> 01:18:14,509
I have to tell you right now.

1545
01:18:14,546 --> 01:18:18,424
Um, I didn't mean anything I said back
there, not word.

1546
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:22,469
I know you may be a little, um, um...

1547
01:18:22,506 --> 01:18:23,850
Uh, chemically imbalanced,

1548
01:18:23,887 --> 01:18:26,640
But you've been right about a lot
of things.

1549
01:18:26,676 --> 01:18:30,077
I... I don't want you to leave.

1550
01:18:30,114 --> 01:18:33,479
You're my son, and I... love you.

1551
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:41,575
Uh, buddy, uh...

1552
01:18:41,612 --> 01:18:44,489
What was it you wanted to tell me?

1553
01:18:44,526 --> 01:18:46,867
Oh, right. Come with me.

1554
01:18:46,903 --> 01:18:48,660
Right. Come on.

1555
01:18:54,875 --> 01:18:56,339
I'm herewith another eyewitness

1556
01:18:56,375 --> 01:18:58,669
Who has his own version of what
happened.

1557
01:18:58,706 --> 01:18:59,801
Sir, what did you see?

1558
01:18:59,837 --> 01:19:01,009
I think you're great, Charlotte.

1559
01:19:01,046 --> 01:19:02,839
Uh, I saw something fall from the
sky

1560
01:19:02,876 --> 01:19:04,633
Right into the middle of central
park.

1561
01:19:04,670 --> 01:19:07,011
I mean, you're a great news lady.

1562
01:19:07,047 --> 01:19:07,808
Thank you.

1563
01:19:07,845 --> 01:19:08,851
Could you tell me a bit more?

1564
01:19:08,887 --> 01:19:10,200
About what you saw fall from the
sky?

1565
01:19:10,237 --> 01:19:11,478
Yeah, yeah. Your eyes tell the
story,

1566
01:19:11,514 --> 01:19:13,516
That's what I love about you.
You've got a great mouth.

1567
01:19:13,552 --> 01:19:15,974
The thing just dropped in the middle of
central park.

1568
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:18,396
It was amazing, and everybody's, like,
going crazy.

1569
01:19:18,433 --> 01:19:20,356
Dick, uh, according to authorities,

1570
01:19:20,392 --> 01:19:21,529
The area has been cleared.

1571
01:19:21,566 --> 01:19:25,153
Only the central park rangers now
remain in the park.

1572
01:19:25,189 --> 01:19:26,987
These forces are highly trained,

1573
01:19:27,024 --> 01:19:28,368
But rarely see action.

1574
01:19:28,405 --> 01:19:31,533
Some have accused them of being
too gung ho

1575
01:19:31,569 --> 01:19:32,414
When called into duty,

1576
01:19:32,451 --> 01:19:35,182
And their controversial crowd
control tactics

1577
01:19:35,219 --> 01:19:37,915
At the Simon and Garfunkel concert
in '85

1578
01:19:37,952 --> 01:19:40,268
Are still under investigation.

1579
01:19:40,305 --> 01:19:42,548
I knew you'd find it, Mr. Elf!

1580
01:19:42,585 --> 01:19:45,922
Slap it on real quick, we've got
to get going.

1581
01:19:48,381 --> 01:19:50,154
Thattaboy.

1582
01:19:50,191 --> 01:19:51,927
Chuckles

1583
01:19:52,595 --> 01:19:55,326
So, uh... you're, uh...

1584
01:19:55,363 --> 01:19:58,058
Santa Claus. Right.

1585
01:19:59,183 --> 01:20:03,145
Would you mind taking this to
your firstborn?

1586
01:20:03,182 --> 01:20:03,651
Sure.

1587
01:20:03,688 --> 01:20:06,899
Um, uh, and my firstborn, he's
an elf?

1588
01:20:06,936 --> 01:20:10,569
Yes. Actually, I'm adopted.

1589
01:20:10,903 --> 01:20:14,907
Uh, Michael, would you open this
hatch for me, please?

1590
01:20:20,621 --> 01:20:22,669
Thattaboy, thank you.

1591
01:20:22,706 --> 01:20:26,418
So, you're really Santa Claus?

1592
01:20:26,455 --> 01:20:29,129
You never can tell, kid.

1593
01:20:29,165 --> 01:20:29,967
Tell me, Michael,

1594
01:20:30,004 --> 01:20:31,714
What do you want for Christmas?

1595
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:34,860
I wanted a skateboard.

1596
01:20:34,897 --> 01:20:38,435
Oh, not just skateboard.

1597
01:20:38,472 --> 01:20:41,974
A real hufboard. Looked here.

1598
01:20:42,011 --> 01:20:43,397
Looked here...

1599
01:20:43,433 --> 01:20:45,477
How do you like them apples?

1600
01:20:45,513 --> 01:20:48,229
Go look and see.

1601
01:20:54,527 --> 01:20:55,986
Whoa.

1602
01:21:02,702 --> 01:21:03,708
What happened?

1603
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:06,496
You made my sleigh fly.

1604
01:21:06,532 --> 01:21:07,210
What do you mean?

1605
01:21:07,247 --> 01:21:09,421
Well, before the turbine days,

1606
01:21:09,458 --> 01:21:12,461
This baby used to run solely on
Christmas spirit.

1607
01:21:12,498 --> 01:21:15,878
You believed in me. You made my
sleigh fly.

1608
01:21:15,915 --> 01:21:19,221
Hold it... if you're really Santa
Claus,

1609
01:21:19,258 --> 01:21:21,676
Then we can just get some news
cameras in here,

1610
01:21:21,713 --> 01:21:22,905
And everyone will believe in you,

1611
01:21:22,941 --> 01:21:24,059
Then your sleigh will fly, right?

1612
01:21:24,096 --> 01:21:27,098
Christmas spirit is about believing,
not seeing.

1613
01:21:27,135 --> 01:21:30,064
If the whole world saw me,
all would be lost.

1614
01:21:30,101 --> 01:21:34,272
The paparazzi have been trying to
nail me for years.

1615
01:21:34,309 --> 01:21:35,815
Horse whinnies

1616
01:21:37,067 --> 01:21:38,525
Hey, look!

1617
01:21:39,152 --> 01:21:42,029
Horse whinnies

1618
01:21:44,531 --> 01:21:47,035
Oh, no.

1619
01:21:47,493 --> 01:21:51,246
It's the central park rangers.

1620
01:21:51,282 --> 01:21:53,498
Horses whinny

1621
01:21:55,501 --> 01:22:00,798
Dad, Michael... I got a plan.

1622
01:22:08,553 --> 01:22:11,227
Santa: Whoa, wait! Wait, Michael...
my list!

1623
01:22:11,264 --> 01:22:14,059
You bring that list back right now,
you hear me?!

1624
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:16,103
Come on, give me your hat and coat.

1625
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:19,064
Mrs. Claus made them for me.

1626
01:22:23,317 --> 01:22:26,320
Hey! Hey, here I am!

1627
01:22:28,197 --> 01:22:29,120
Ho ho ho!

1628
01:22:29,157 --> 01:22:33,828
Hey, ho ho ho! Hey! Hey!

1629
01:22:41,210 --> 01:22:43,216
Excuse me. Thank you. Excuse me.

1630
01:22:43,253 --> 01:22:45,213
So the authorities have not
discovered

1631
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:47,053
Any reindeer in the park?

1632
01:22:47,090 --> 01:22:48,591
No, no reindeer. Sleigh bells?

1633
01:22:48,628 --> 01:22:49,860
No, no sleigh bells, either.

1634
01:22:49,897 --> 01:22:51,057
Elves? Excuse me, please.

1635
01:22:51,094 --> 01:22:52,262
None of that, we really just
need everyone...

1636
01:22:52,299 --> 01:22:53,309
It's him, it's the real Santa!

1637
01:22:53,345 --> 01:22:55,097
His sleigh won't fly, ' cause nobody
believes in him!

1638
01:22:55,134 --> 01:22:57,057
Charlotte: Did you see something
in the park?

1639
01:22:57,093 --> 01:22:57,688
Everyone out there,

1640
01:22:57,725 --> 01:23:00,227
Santa needs us to believe,
I can prove he's real.

1641
01:23:00,264 --> 01:23:01,066
Look, this is his list!

1642

A new development in the story, uh,

1658
01:23:33,133 --> 01:23:35,761
A confirmation that Santa must
have been sighted

1659
01:23:35,797 --> 01:23:37,595
Because we have his book right
here.

1660
01:23:37,632 --> 01:23:39,310

(Crowd oohs and aahs)

1667
01:23:56,654 --> 01:23:57,577

01:23:57,614 --> 01:23:59,678
Newsman: Charlotte...

1669
01:23:59,715 --> 01:24:01,742
Hey, turn the cameras back on!

1670
01:24:01,779 --> 01:24:02,911
Who told you to say that?

1671
01:24:02,947 --> 01:24:03,791
It's the real Santa.

1672
01:24:03,827 --> 01:24:05,914
We need to get these cameras
back on.

1673
01:24:05,950 --> 01:24:07,085
He needs our help!

1674
01:24:07,122 --> 01:24:09,458
Hey, Michael, are you okay?

1675
01:24:09,495 --> 01:24:10,130
Yeah, I'm fine.

1676
01:24:10,167 --> 01:24:13,419
But buddy, he's... he's in the
park with Santa,

1677
01:24:13,456 --> 01:24:14,633
The sleigh won't fly

1678
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:16,672
'cause there's no Christmas
spirit.

1679
01:24:16,709 --> 01:24:19,527
Michael! Mom!

1680
01:24:19,563 --> 01:24:22,309
Michael! Ohh!

1681
01:24:22,345 --> 01:24:24,643
Are you okay? I'm fine.

1682
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,683
The best way to spread
Christmas cheer

1683
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:31,812
Is singing loud for all
to hear.

1684
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:34,356
Sighs

1685
01:24:36,149 --> 01:24:39,006
Buddy... better get going,
get in now!

1686
01:24:39,042 --> 01:24:41,863
Santa, I'm not done with the
engine yet!

1687
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:43,161
Can't wait!

1688
01:24:43,198 --> 01:24:45,746
On, dasher, on, dancer...

1689
01:24:45,783 --> 01:24:48,160
I'm not done with the engine!

1690
01:24:48,197 --> 01:24:50,662
Santa cheers

1691
01:24:51,996 --> 01:24:53,170
That's okay.

1692
01:24:53,206 --> 01:24:56,502
You get started, I'll catch up!

1693
01:25:01,382 --> 01:25:03,925
You know, he wasn't lying.

1694
01:25:03,961 --> 01:25:06,469
Chuckles merry Christmas.

1695
01:25:06,505 --> 01:25:08,262
Chuckles

1696
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:13,188
Santa, I can't...

1697
01:25:13,225 --> 01:25:15,853
Stop messing around and get in!

1698
01:25:15,890 --> 01:25:19,189
Aah! Toy squeals

1699
01:25:24,235 --> 01:25:26,320
Santa, why are they chasing us?!

1700
01:25:26,357 --> 01:25:28,406
I put them on the naughty list,

1701
01:25:28,442 --> 01:25:30,867
And they never forgave me.

1702
01:25:36,246 --> 01:25:40,063
You better watch out,
you better not cry

1703
01:25:40,099 --> 01:25:43,879
You better not pout,
I'm telling you why

1704
01:25:43,915 --> 01:25:49,760
Santa Claus is coming' to town

1705
01:25:49,797 --> 01:25:53,722
Santa: Yaah, yaah, yaah!

1706
01:25:54,764 --> 01:25:56,813
Santa: Up, up, pull up!

1707
01:25:56,849 --> 01:26:01,186
Buddy! We need power, we're
gonna crash!

1708
01:26:01,223 --> 01:26:05,292
He's making a list,
Checking it twice

1709
01:26:05,328 --> 01:26:09,360
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

1710
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:14,863
Santa Claus is coming' to town

1711
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:20,330
He sees you when you're sleeping

1712
01:26:20,367 --> 01:26:23,211
He knows when you're awake

1713
01:26:23,248 --> 01:26:27,044
He knows if you've been bad or good

1714
01:26:27,081 --> 01:26:29,760
So be good for goodness sake

1715
01:26:29,797 --> 01:26:34,134
Oh, you better watch out,
you better not cry

1716
01:26:34,170 --> 01:26:38,471
You better not pout, I'm telling
you why

1717
01:26:38,507 --> 01:26:44,559
Santa Claus is coming to town

1718
01:26:50,899 --> 01:26:51,947
Devilish laughter aah!

1719
01:26:51,983 --> 01:26:54,528
Santa: You can do it!
Come on, dancer.

1720
01:26:54,565 --> 01:26:56,528
That's my boy.

1721
01:26:56,564 --> 01:26:58,590
Pull, cupid! Aah!

1722
01:26:58,626 --> 01:27:00,579
Pull, dasher!

1723
01:27:00,616 --> 01:27:04,787
I'm getting too old for this job.

1724
01:27:04,824 --> 01:27:06,288
Now!

1725
01:27:09,082 --> 01:27:11,292
Screaming

1726
01:27:14,337 --> 01:27:16,881
Laughing

1727
01:27:19,592 --> 01:27:21,302
The engine's gone!

1728
01:27:21,339 --> 01:27:22,821
We're toast!

1729
01:27:22,858 --> 01:27:24,305
Screaming

1730
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:30,315
Well, still no sign of Santa,

1731
01:27:30,352 --> 01:27:32,438
But some spontaneous Christmas
caroling

1732
01:27:32,475 --> 01:27:33,318
Has broken out

1733
01:27:33,355 --> 01:27:35,399
Right herein front of central
park.

1734
01:27:35,436 --> 01:27:36,446
Let's have a listen in.

1735
01:27:36,483 --> 01:27:38,317
He sees you when you're sleeping

1736
01:27:38,354 --> 01:27:41,827
He knows if you're awake

1737
01:27:41,863 --> 01:27:45,825
He knows if you've been bad or
good

1738
01:27:45,862 --> 01:27:49,620
So be good for goodness sake

1739
01:27:49,657 --> 01:27:50,042
Hey!

1740
01:27:50,079 --> 01:27:53,853
You better watch out, you better
not cry

1741
01:27:53,890 --> 01:27:57,628
You better not pout, I'm telling
you why

1742
01:27:57,664 --> 01:27:58,009
Come on!

1743
01:27:58,046 --> 01:28:02,320
Santa Claus is coming' to town

1744
01:28:02,356 --> 01:28:06,595
Santa: Just a little more!

1745
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:12,855
Hal-yah!

1746
01:28:12,892 --> 01:28:15,519
He knows when you're awake

1747
01:28:15,556 --> 01:28:16,817
He knows if you've

1748
01:28:16,854 --> 01:28:19,398
Wait... you're not singing.

1749
01:28:19,435 --> 01:28:20,362
Yes, I am.

1750
01:28:20,399 --> 01:28:23,610
No, you're not. You're just moving
your lips.

1751
01:28:23,647 --> 01:28:25,451
Santa!

1752
01:28:25,488 --> 01:28:28,073
Michael, please, what's the big deal?

1753
01:28:28,109 --> 01:28:28,870
Dad.

1754
01:28:28,907 --> 01:28:29,872
I'm telling you why

1755
01:28:29,909 --> 01:28:35,663
Santa Claus is coming to town

1756
01:28:36,706 --> 01:28:40,168
Laughing

1757
01:28:41,377 --> 01:28:43,712
Santa chuckling

1758
01:28:43,749 --> 01:28:46,011
Oh! Ha ha ha!

1759
01:28:46,048 --> 01:28:48,175
Santa: Now, my beauties!

1760
01:28:48,212 --> 01:28:50,176
Santa chuckling

1761
01:28:55,431 --> 01:28:56,521
Bye-bye.

1762
01:28:56,557 --> 01:28:58,788
Santa: Just like the old days!

1763
01:28:58,825 --> 01:29:00,983
Newsman: Charlotte? Charlotte?

1764
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:03,731
Well, I guess we'll never know for
sure

1765
01:29:03,767 --> 01:29:05,732
What happened this Christmas Eve?

1766
01:29:05,769 --> 01:29:07,072
In central park.

1767
01:29:07,109 --> 01:29:13,240
Santa: Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!

1768
01:29:13,276 --> 01:29:16,122
Ho ho ho!

1769
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:19,120
Papa elf: And so, with a little help,

1770
01:29:19,157 --> 01:29:21,044
Buddy managed to save Christmas.

1771
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:23,958
And his spirit saved a lot of other
People, too.

1772
01:29:23,994 --> 01:29:30,756
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1773
01:29:30,793 --> 01:29:37,100
And never brought to mind

1774
01:29:37,137 --> 01:29:44,399
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1775
01:29:44,436 --> 01:29:47,981
Walter started his own independent
publishing company.

1776
01:29:48,018 --> 01:29:50,730
His first book was written by a
brand new,

1777
01:29:50,767 --> 01:29:53,444
Critically acclaimed children's
author.

1778
01:29:53,481 --> 01:29:55,235
The book was elf...

1779
01:29:55,272 --> 01:29:56,952
A, uh, fictional story

1780
01:29:56,989 --> 01:29:59,094
About an adopted elf named buddy

1781
01:29:59,131 --> 01:30:01,167
Who was raised in the North Pole?

1782
01:30:01,203 --> 01:30:03,202
Went to New York, ate spaghetti,

1783
01:30:03,239 --> 01:30:05,598
Worked in a shiny mailroom,

1784
01:30:05,634 --> 01:30:07,921
And eventually saved Christmas.

1785
01:30:07,957 --> 01:30:10,710
"First, I traveled through the
seven levels

1786
01:30:10,747 --> 01:30:13,009
"Of the candy cane forest,

1787
01:30:13,046 --> 01:30:17,637
"Past the sea of twirly-swirly
gumdrops,

1788
01:30:17,674 --> 01:30:22,512
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel."

1789
01:30:22,548 --> 01:30:24,728
And as for me, I can't complain.

1790
01:30:24,764 --> 01:30:27,184
Buddy comes up to visit from time
to time.

1791
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:30,746
In the meadow we can build a
snowman

1792
01:30:30,783 --> 01:30:34,237
And pretend that he is parson
brown

1793
01:30:34,273 --> 01:30:37,485
Oh, thank you, Jovie. That's very
sweet of you.

1794
01:30:37,521 --> 01:30:38,991
You're welcome, papa.

1795
01:30:39,028 --> 01:30:43,032
But you can do the job when
you're in town

1796
01:30:43,069 --> 01:30:44,496
Hey, Suzie.

1797
01:30:44,532 --> 01:30:45,455
Come here, little one.

1798
01:30:45,492 --> 01:30:48,036
When it snows, ain't it
thrilling?

1799
01:30:48,073 --> 01:30:49,500
Papa wants to see you.

1800
01:30:49,537 --> 01:30:53,123
Though your nose get a
little chilling

1801
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:53,540
Buddy...
