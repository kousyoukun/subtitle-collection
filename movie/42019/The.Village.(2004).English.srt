1
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,060
Who'll pinch me to wake me up?

2
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,140
Who will laugh at me when I fall?

3
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,610
Whose breath will I listen for...

4
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,410
...so that I may sleep?

5
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,780
Whose hand will I hold...

6
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,789
...so that I may walk?

7
00:03:03,749 --> 00:03:11,179
We may question ourselves
at moments such as these.

8
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:15,589
Did we make the right decision
to settle here?

9
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:29,799
We are grateful for the time
we have been given.

10
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:21,196
What manner of spectacle has attracted
your attention so splendidly?

11
00:06:21,276 --> 00:06:25,476
I ought to carry it in my pocket
to help me teach.

12
00:06:33,586 --> 00:06:35,916
Who came upon this?

13
00:06:39,626 --> 00:06:43,026
- Philip, did you move this?
- No, Mr. Walker.

14
00:06:51,565 --> 00:06:55,635
I inspected it carefully. Its head was
twisted back and much of its fur removed.

15
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:59,075
- I see.
- It was murdered.

16
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:01,475
But who is the culprit?

17
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:05,105
Who has done this heinous act?

18
00:07:05,185 --> 00:07:09,585
- Those We Don't Speak Of killed it.
- There it is.

19
00:07:09,655 --> 00:07:13,415
Why would such a notion
come into your mind?

20
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:16,815
- They're meat eaters.
- Mmm.

21
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,925
They have large claws.

22
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:21,985
Children...

23
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:27,935
...Those We Don't Speak Of have not
breached our borders for many years.

24
00:07:29,005 --> 00:07:32,135
We do not go into their woods,

25
00:07:32,205 --> 00:07:35,445
they do not come into our valley.

26
00:07:35,515 --> 00:07:37,505
It is a truce.

27
00:07:37,585 --> 00:07:40,075
We do not threaten them.

28
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:42,145
Why would they do this?

29
00:07:42,215 --> 00:07:47,244
And we ought not to overlook
the Flight of the Birds.

30
00:07:47,324 --> 00:07:51,764
We didn't have it last year
and I, for one, missed it desperately.

31
00:07:53,164 --> 00:07:57,994
And I know your wife missed
the children dressed in feathers and such.

32
00:07:58,064 --> 00:08:00,564
- I am fond of it.
- Mmm.

33
00:08:01,704 --> 00:08:04,034
I do not have a say in this matter.

34
00:08:04,104 --> 00:08:06,734
August Nicholson is chair
of today's meeting.

35
00:08:09,244 --> 00:08:14,184
There's a young man who has
requested a word with the elders.

36
00:08:14,254 --> 00:08:16,744
Well, do have him come forward.

37
00:08:18,684 --> 00:08:20,524
Alice.

38
00:08:23,564 --> 00:08:26,424
Hello, Lucius.

39
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:35,594
"My mother is unaware
of the reason for my visit today."

40
00:08:35,674 --> 00:08:41,114
"She did not give her consent
or consult me in any form."

41
00:08:43,813 --> 00:08:47,843
"The passing of little
Daniel Nicholson from illness,

42
00:08:47,913 --> 00:08:50,783
and other events,
have weighed on my thoughts."

43
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:55,083
"I ask permission to cross
into the forbidden woods

44
00:08:55,153 --> 00:08:57,283
and travel to the nearest town."

45
00:08:57,363 --> 00:09:01,523
"I will gather new medicines,
and I will return."

46
00:09:01,593 --> 00:09:04,323
"With regards to
Those We Don't Speak Of,

47
00:09:04,403 --> 00:09:07,063
I am certain they will let me pass."

48
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:11,763
"Creatures can sense emotion and fear."

49
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:15,533
"They will see I am pure of intention,
and not afraid."

50
00:09:15,613 --> 00:09:17,603
"The end."

51
00:09:25,153 --> 00:09:28,023
What goes on
in that head of yours?

52
00:09:30,563 --> 00:09:32,853
Say something, Lucius.

53
00:09:36,303 --> 00:09:41,103
Finton Coin is in the tower,
and I've promised to sit with him.

54
00:09:41,173 --> 00:09:43,162
Hmm.

55
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:48,772
Do you ever think of the towns, Finton?

56
00:09:48,842 --> 00:09:51,312
The towns?

57
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,042
What for?

58
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:58,412
They're wicked places
where wicked people live. That's all.

59
00:10:03,662 --> 00:10:06,962
Thank you, Lucius.

60
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:09,192
You're a good friend.

61
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:16,602
I do hope no one saw you.

62
00:10:39,232 --> 00:10:44,601
What we seem to have amongst us
is a predator of some type,

63
00:10:44,661 --> 00:10:48,831
most likely a coyote or a wolf.

64
00:10:50,741 --> 00:10:55,071
Its manner of... of killing
and removing the fur,

65
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:58,471
but leaving the flesh torn,

66
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:02,741
may be a sign that this animal
suffers from madness.

67
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:06,781
And for the next fortnight,
we should be vigilant

68
00:11:06,851 --> 00:11:09,291
for sightings of this coyote.

69
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:13,851
Keep careful watch over
our little ones as they play on the hills.

70
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:21,131
As for the other notion...

71
00:11:21,201 --> 00:11:25,571
...we do not believe
our boundary has been breached.

72
00:11:25,641 --> 00:11:32,201
Those We Don't Speak Of are much
larger creatures than coyotes...

73
00:11:33,181 --> 00:11:36,711
...and we would know
if they had been here.

74
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:45,550
Ahh, it's frightful, this business
with the coyote. Is it not, Papa?

75
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,680
- Do not feel worried, Kitty.
- You are not troubled?

76
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,160
I'm certain it will all end soon.

77
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:56,000
- Can we speak on other matters, then?
- It would be a relief.

78
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,130
I'm in love!

79
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,870
I want your permission
to marry, Papa.

80
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,410
There's a proper manner in which
things are supposed to happen.

81
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,070
Such as the boy would normally be
standing next to you,

82
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,670
in a moment such as this...
Where is the boy in all this, Kitty?

83
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,240
I haven't spoken to him as of yet.

84
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,080
The young man is unaware
of your intentions?

85
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,920
He has a quiet way. I was going to talk with
him, Papa, but not without your blessings.

86
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,190
I won't talk with him without your blessings.

87
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,660
Kitty!

88
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,990
It's Lucius Hunt.

89
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,030
Lucius?

90
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,160
You think badly of him?

91
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,940
- No, no. I have been thinking about him.
- He's not like the other boys, Papa.

92
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,070
He doesn't joke or bounce about.

93
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,379
No, he certainly does not.

94
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:46,749
Do I have your blessings, then?

95
00:12:53,489 --> 00:12:55,889
Look, do me one favor first.

96
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:02,419
Do not tell anyone else of your burstings
until you have spoken with the young man.

97
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:11,169
Good afternoon, Lucius.

98
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:18,309
I wanted to... to... to tell you something.

99
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:23,549
I love you, Lucius.

100
00:13:25,219 --> 00:13:29,419
I love you... like the day is long.

101
00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:32,089
I love you more than
the sun and the moon together.

102
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,759
And if you feel the same way,
then we should not hide it any longer.

103
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,669
It's a gift, love is.
We should be thankful.

104
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:44,968
We should bellow it out
with all the breath in our lungs.

105
00:13:45,038 --> 00:13:47,908
Thank you! Thank you!

106
00:13:47,978 --> 00:13:50,378
Thank you!

107
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:58,848
Shh, shh.

108
00:13:58,918 --> 00:14:02,188
Shh.

109
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:10,228
# Baby, sleep, gently sleep

110
00:14:10,298 --> 00:14:15,898
# Life is long and love is deep

111
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:21,538
# Time will be sweet for thee

112
00:14:21,608 --> 00:14:25,138
# All the world to see

113
00:14:25,218 --> 00:14:29,548
# Time to look about and know

114
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:33,608
# How the shadows come and go

115
00:14:33,688 --> 00:14:39,598
# How the breeze stirs the trees

116
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:43,997
# How the blossoms grow

117
00:14:55,077 --> 00:15:00,607
I often wondered if you and my son bonded
because neither of you is fond of speaking.

118
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:02,747
You're very kind.

119
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:06,807
You must pardon my manners.
I haven't slept in many nights.

120
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:17,897
You are doing capital,
Jamison.

121
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:21,767
Just a few more moments, huh?
Gather your bravery.

122
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:26,137
Do not jostle about so. You'll ruin my shirt.

123
00:15:31,617 --> 00:15:36,487
They made a sound when I made a sound,
and they mimic before they attack.

124
00:15:36,557 --> 00:15:40,176
Have courage, man.
That's a wives' tale. It isn't true.

125
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:42,956
Do not falter. Steel yourself!

126
00:15:47,926 --> 00:15:51,056
You know,
like a dog can smell you.

127
00:15:51,136 --> 00:15:54,196
- Pardon me, Mr. Nicholson?
- Hmm.

128
00:15:57,776 --> 00:16:01,636
You may run from sorrow, as we have.

129
00:16:01,706 --> 00:16:04,376
Sorrow will find you.

130
00:16:07,016 --> 00:16:09,746
It can smell you.

131
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:52,915
Hurry.

132
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:02,765
I didn't know you could run so fast.

133
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:05,565
We're still for running and staying... Hey!

134
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:12,575
Noah ought to be punished. He
whacked little Joseph with a stick again.

135
00:17:14,715 --> 00:17:17,145
- Ouch!
- No more hitting! Put it down!

136
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:19,445
Ow, ow, ow!

137
00:17:19,515 --> 00:17:21,485
Why don't they grab it?

138
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,825
Noah Percy!

139
00:17:35,835 --> 00:17:38,535
Stop your fussing right this moment.

140
00:17:51,214 --> 00:17:53,374
You're in trouble, you know.

141
00:17:53,454 --> 00:17:57,614
- No hitting, no hitting.
- I'm to place you in the quiet room.

142
00:17:57,694 --> 00:18:00,454
Um, I'll cry quarts.

143
00:18:00,524 --> 00:18:04,984
- What if we strike a deal?
- Yeah, capital idea.

144
00:18:05,064 --> 00:18:08,834
It would be prudent to keep our deal
a secret. Can you do that?

145
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:12,064
Can I keep a secret?
Like a church mouse.

146
00:18:13,874 --> 00:18:16,534
You needn't go to the quiet room
if you a take an oath

147
00:18:16,614 --> 00:18:19,944
to never strike any person again.

148
00:18:21,614 --> 00:18:24,244
- No hitting, no hitting.
- No. No hitting.

149
00:18:24,314 --> 00:18:25,714
- No hitting.
- No hitting.

150
00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:27,774
No hitting.

151
00:18:29,584 --> 00:18:31,924
The deal is struck.

152
00:18:39,263 --> 00:18:41,563
We ought not return right away, huh?

153
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:45,593
What shall we do
with our stolen time?

154
00:18:45,673 --> 00:18:47,333
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

155
00:18:47,403 --> 00:18:50,303
- Hmm. Shall we have a foot race?
- Yes.

156
00:18:50,373 --> 00:18:52,903
- Up the hill to the resting rock?
- No cheating.

157
00:18:52,973 --> 00:18:55,943
What a deeply scandalous thing to say.
I insist you take that back.

158
00:18:56,013 --> 00:18:58,343
Is that the school bell?

159
00:19:05,793 --> 00:19:08,153
Ivy, you cheated!

160
00:19:08,223 --> 00:19:10,563
I know! I'm sorry!

161
00:19:16,603 --> 00:19:18,593
Whoo!

162
00:19:38,122 --> 00:19:41,152
My sister cried a lot.

163
00:19:42,622 --> 00:19:45,922
You wonder how I recognized you?

164
00:19:45,992 --> 00:19:51,262
Some people - just a handful,
mind you - give off the tiniest color.

165
00:19:51,332 --> 00:19:54,632
It's faint, like a haze.

166
00:19:54,702 --> 00:19:59,232
It's the only thing
I ever see in the darkness.

167
00:19:59,312 --> 00:20:01,642
Papa has it, too.

168
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:06,082
Do you wonder what your color is?

169
00:20:06,152 --> 00:20:08,952
Well, that I won't tell you.
It's not ladylike to speak of such things.

170
00:20:09,022 --> 00:20:11,212
You shouldn't even have asked.

171
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,322
You run like a boy.

172
00:20:22,902 --> 00:20:25,062
Thank you.

173
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:32,372
I know why you denied my sister.

174
00:20:34,312 --> 00:20:37,042
When I was younger...

175
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:40,781
...you used to hold my arm
when I walked.

176
00:20:41,651 --> 00:20:45,111
Then suddenly, you stopped.

177
00:20:45,191 --> 00:20:49,061
One day, I even tripped
in your presence, and nearly fell.

178
00:20:49,121 --> 00:20:53,931
I was faking, of course,
but still, you did not hold me.

179
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:57,831
Sometimes we don't do
things we want to do

180
00:20:57,901 --> 00:21:01,531
so that others won't know
we want to do them.

181
00:21:11,911 --> 00:21:13,901
What?

182
00:21:24,561 --> 00:21:27,931
What's this? Oh, berries.

183
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:30,331
What a splendid present.

184
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:32,391
Be cautious.

185
00:21:32,471 --> 00:21:34,801
You are holding the bad color.

186
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:45,880
This color attracts Those We Don't
Speak Of. You must bury it.

187
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,550
You ought not to pick
that color berry any more.

188
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,280
He picked it from his pocket.

189
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,490
What's wrong?
Your breathing has changed.

190
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,330
I've never set eyes
on these before.

191
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,160
You did not pick that now.
Where did you find this?

192
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,600
"Today at Resting Rock,

193
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:20,210
Noah Percy handed Ivy Walker berries
of the bad color."

194
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,510
"When asked where
he found these berries,

195
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,080
for they were not like
others I have seen,

196
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:28,450
he pointed to the drawing
upon Resting Rock."

197
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,390
"It is my belief that Noah Percy
has entered the woods,

198
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,859
and has done so on many occasions."

199
00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:40,369
"It is also my belief that,
because of his innocence,

200
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:44,029
those creatures who reside
in the woods did not harm him."

201
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:47,539
"This strengthens my feeling
that they will let me pass

202
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:50,579
if they sense I am not a threat."

203
00:22:51,479 --> 00:22:55,109
We shall speak of the town,
just this once,

204
00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:58,279
and we shall never speak of it again.

205
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:06,589
Your father left for the market
on a Tuesday,

206
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:09,689
at a quarter past nine in the morning.

207
00:23:13,069 --> 00:23:19,059
He was found robbed and naked
in the filthy river, two days later.

208
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:28,269
Why'd you tell me this blackness?

209
00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:31,649
So you will know the nature
of what you desire.

210
00:23:32,989 --> 00:23:36,478
I do not desire it.
My intentions are true to my word.

211
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:39,028
I think of nothing
but the people of this village.

212
00:23:39,088 --> 00:23:44,328
Forgive me.
I am but scared for my only son's life.

213
00:23:44,398 --> 00:23:47,728
I am not the one with secrets.

214
00:23:50,108 --> 00:23:52,158
What is your meaning?

215
00:23:53,838 --> 00:23:57,238
There are secrets
in every corner of this village.

216
00:23:58,248 --> 00:24:02,578
Do you not feel it? Do you not see it?

217
00:24:03,548 --> 00:24:05,138
That is for my own well-being,

218
00:24:05,218 --> 00:24:09,318
so the evil things from my past
are kept close and not forgotten.

219
00:24:09,388 --> 00:24:11,988
Forgetting would be to let them
be born again in another form.

220
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:14,048
Then let us open it.

221
00:24:14,128 --> 00:24:16,528
No!

222
00:24:16,598 --> 00:24:19,358
Perhaps we should speak
with Edward Walker together.

223
00:24:19,428 --> 00:24:22,798
- He may be able...
- He hides, too.

224
00:24:22,868 --> 00:24:25,358
He hides his feelings for you.

225
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:29,108
Oh.

226
00:24:36,747 --> 00:24:38,877
Sometimes we don't do things,

227
00:24:38,947 --> 00:24:42,887
yet others know we want to do things,
so we don't do them.

228
00:24:47,427 --> 00:24:50,257
What nonsense are you saying?

229
00:24:54,637 --> 00:24:57,967
You needn't worry.
Nothing will happen to me.

230
00:25:02,107 --> 00:25:05,307
You remind me of a colt sometimes.

231
00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:15,917
What makes you think
he has feelings for me?

232
00:25:20,157 --> 00:25:22,487
He never touches you.

233
00:27:37,594 --> 00:27:40,114
There's no escape!

234
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,364
Oh, hello.

235
00:27:45,434 --> 00:27:47,904
I was just playing a game with Noah.

236
00:27:47,974 --> 00:27:51,064
The rascal must have gone
to hide in my house again.

237
00:27:51,144 --> 00:27:53,194
Houses are against the rules!

238
00:27:53,274 --> 00:27:55,604
He knows that.

239
00:27:58,244 --> 00:28:00,584
Are you all right?

240
00:28:02,954 --> 00:28:08,614
We're tending to the children tonight,
Kitty and I. I should be with her. Be well.

241
00:28:14,494 --> 00:28:17,834
I heard my parents speaking of you.

242
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:22,204
I know of your request to go to the towns.

243
00:28:22,274 --> 00:28:26,534
I think it is noble,
but I do not think it is right.

244
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:30,444
Are you not angry
you have no sight?

245
00:28:30,514 --> 00:28:34,543
I see the world, Lucius Hunt.

246
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:36,943
Just not as you see it.

247
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:47,723
What of Noah, then?

248
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:52,533
What if there are medicines for Noah
that could help him be still and to learn?

249
00:28:52,603 --> 00:28:56,933
May we stop speaking of this?
It is putting knots in my stomach.

250
00:29:02,013 --> 00:29:05,173
Kitty is to be married.

251
00:29:06,183 --> 00:29:11,883
She's found love, again,
with Christop Crane.

252
00:29:11,953 --> 00:29:14,513
You think it an odd choice, right?

253
00:29:14,593 --> 00:29:20,463
You know, he won't sit back in his chair
for fear of setting wrinkles on his shirts.

254
00:29:20,533 --> 00:29:24,223
But he does have
a gentlemanly way about him...

255
00:29:24,303 --> 00:29:28,463
...and he does care for my sister deeply.

256
00:29:29,673 --> 00:29:32,073
I think Kitty is blessed.

257
00:29:35,312 --> 00:29:38,242
I am blessed as well.

258
00:29:38,312 --> 00:29:41,512
My older sister is now spoken for.

259
00:29:41,582 --> 00:29:44,812
I am now free to receive
interest from anyone...

260
00:29:46,922 --> 00:29:49,512
...who might have interest.

261
00:29:59,102 --> 00:30:02,332
I'm going to get you. Oh!

262
00:30:02,402 --> 00:30:05,802
I got you. I got you.
Can you fetch a blanket for me?

263
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:08,362
Have you seen Noah?

264
00:30:26,862 --> 00:30:28,692
Lucius?

265
00:30:46,781 --> 00:30:48,841
Lucius?

266
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,890
- Hurry, to the cellar!
- Oh, good gracious!

267
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:59,240
- They're coming. They're coming.
- Close the door.

268
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,880
- Noah, close the door, OK?
- They're coming.

269
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,280
- Close the door.
- Coming!

270
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,720
Here we go.

271
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,760
- Noah, come on inside!
- Come on inside!

272
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,190
Everyone, inside!
Everyone, inside!

273
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:42,649
- They're coming. Come on in.
- Let's close the door.

274
00:32:42,729 --> 00:32:45,959
- Lucius is outside, walking.
- They're coming.

275
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:50,659
He's inside safe somewhere!
Please, close the door!

276
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:55,369
He'll come back to make sure we're safe.

277
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:58,069
Ivy! Ivy, please.

278
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:29,199
- Please.
- No.

279
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:32,938
Don't let them in.

280
00:34:17,718 --> 00:34:19,878
Come on in.

281
00:35:01,797 --> 00:35:05,597
By the markings we find
this morning on our homes...

282
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:13,537
...I feel they were warning us.
They acted as if threatened.

283
00:35:13,607 --> 00:35:17,977
Creatures have never
attacked us without reason.

284
00:35:18,047 --> 00:35:21,307
Does anyone here know of a reason...

285
00:35:22,447 --> 00:35:25,507
...why these events may have occurred?

286
00:35:33,156 --> 00:35:35,526
Who has written this note?

287
00:35:48,406 --> 00:35:51,036
"Please read so that all may hear."

288
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:53,736
"I have brought this burden upon us."

289
00:35:56,486 --> 00:36:00,646
"On the day before last,
I crossed the forbidden line

290
00:36:00,726 --> 00:36:03,056
into Covington Woods..."

291
00:36:03,126 --> 00:36:07,426
"... and was witnessed there
by Those We Don't Speak Of."

292
00:36:07,496 --> 00:36:10,366
"I am deeply sorry."

293
00:36:10,426 --> 00:36:14,196
"I have shamed myself and my family."

294
00:36:14,266 --> 00:36:18,036
"I pray that my actions
will cause no further pains."

295
00:36:18,106 --> 00:36:21,366
"With deepest sorrow, Lucius Hunt."

296
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:53,565
Is he in trouble?

297
00:37:05,915 --> 00:37:08,515
Do not fret.

298
00:37:17,195 --> 00:37:21,255
You are fearless in a way
that I shall never know.

299
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,874
We are grateful...

300
00:37:35,944 --> 00:37:38,344
...for the time we have been given.

301
00:37:38,414 --> 00:37:40,744
Yes. Yes, indeed.

302
00:37:44,694 --> 00:37:46,684
Cheers.

303
00:38:31,503 --> 00:38:34,233
I had an elder sister.

304
00:38:34,303 --> 00:38:37,173
Mrs. Clack, you've been keeping secrets.

305
00:38:38,743 --> 00:38:42,073
Oh, Kitty reminds me of her so.

306
00:38:44,413 --> 00:38:47,073
What manner of person was she?

307
00:38:48,823 --> 00:38:51,383
- Saucy.
- Oh.

308
00:38:51,453 --> 00:38:53,943
And we fought endlessly.

309
00:38:58,863 --> 00:39:01,193
May I ask her name?

310
00:39:04,433 --> 00:39:08,463
Why did she not come
to Covington Woods?

311
00:39:12,273 --> 00:39:15,803
My sister did not live
past her 23rd birthday.

312
00:39:17,853 --> 00:39:21,343
A group of men took her life
in an alley by our home.

313
00:39:25,193 --> 00:39:27,622
Please rise!

314
00:39:27,692 --> 00:39:29,682
Come on.

315
00:40:03,292 --> 00:40:07,322
She's not going to squeeze
my shirt like that, is she?

316
00:40:19,312 --> 00:40:23,972
Many blessings
on this most joyous of days.

317
00:40:24,042 --> 00:40:26,602
It was a rare and lovely ceremony,
was it not?

318
00:40:26,682 --> 00:40:28,671
Glorious.

319
00:40:30,951 --> 00:40:35,621
I saw your hand move to your eyes
on more than one occasion.

320
00:40:35,691 --> 00:40:38,321
That must have been dust of some matter.

321
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:02,040
Mr. Walker!

322
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,780
- Mr. Walker!
- Mr. Walker!

323
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,220
Behind them.

324
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,650
How did she deal
with this brightness?

325
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,750
Help us out.

326
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,730
Where are
the rest of them?

327
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:28,329
Speak up.

328
00:42:29,569 --> 00:42:31,869
- They're in the village.
- What?

329
00:42:31,939 --> 00:42:34,099
They left more warnings.

330
00:42:34,169 --> 00:42:36,569
They wish us to leave.

331
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:38,979
That cannot be.

332
00:42:39,049 --> 00:42:41,839
One saw us.

333
00:42:41,919 --> 00:42:44,109
It ran off into the darkness.

334
00:42:44,179 --> 00:42:46,649
You are certain?

335
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:56,319
Can you boys stay close to Ivy here?

336
00:42:56,399 --> 00:43:00,029
She'll tell you some funny stories
and have you laughing soon.

337
00:43:08,279 --> 00:43:10,769
We will go together.

338
00:44:07,528 --> 00:44:10,588
Livestock has been taken
and skinned.

339
00:44:11,568 --> 00:44:14,038
The hides and feathers are missing.

340
00:44:14,108 --> 00:44:19,168
There are marks on the door
where it was opened.

341
00:44:22,048 --> 00:44:25,107
The marks are high.

342
00:44:25,187 --> 00:44:28,707
Coyotes cannot reach that height.

343
00:45:31,146 --> 00:45:34,706
The elders are going to have
an inquiry tomorrow.

344
00:45:34,786 --> 00:45:39,446
Each member of the village is to be
questioned in the meeting hall.

345
00:45:39,526 --> 00:45:41,886
To see how
the border was breached?

346
00:45:41,956 --> 00:45:43,946
Yes.

347
00:45:48,796 --> 00:45:50,926
It is cold outside.

348
00:45:50,996 --> 00:45:53,296
You ought to go in.

349
00:45:56,006 --> 00:45:59,636
Why are you on this porch?

350
00:45:59,706 --> 00:46:01,806
It is not safe.

351
00:46:01,876 --> 00:46:04,146
There are other porches.

352
00:46:07,646 --> 00:46:10,416
Do you find me too much of a tomboy?

353
00:46:11,786 --> 00:46:14,486
I do long to do boy things...

354
00:46:15,196 --> 00:46:18,626
...like that game
the boys play at the stump.

355
00:46:18,696 --> 00:46:21,496
They put their backs to the woods,

356
00:46:21,566 --> 00:46:25,435
and see how long they can wait
before getting scared.

357
00:46:27,405 --> 00:46:30,375
That's so exciting.

358
00:46:31,805 --> 00:46:34,245
I understand you hold the record.

359
00:46:35,445 --> 00:46:39,545
It will never be broken, they say.

360
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:43,145
It's just children's games.

361
00:46:43,215 --> 00:46:47,455
How is it you are brave when all
the rest of us shake in our boots?

362
00:46:49,825 --> 00:46:55,495
I do not worry about what will happen,
only what needs to be done.

363
00:46:58,765 --> 00:47:00,755
How did you know I was here?

364
00:47:00,835 --> 00:47:03,165
I saw you out the window.

365
00:47:05,145 --> 00:47:07,045
No...

366
00:47:07,105 --> 00:47:10,045
...I won't tell you your color.

367
00:47:10,115 --> 00:47:12,705
Stop asking.

368
00:47:16,855 --> 00:47:21,015
When we are married,
will you dance with me?

369
00:47:21,085 --> 00:47:24,544
I find dancing very agreeable.

370
00:47:29,194 --> 00:47:32,254
Why can you not say what is in your head?

371
00:47:35,574 --> 00:47:38,634
Why can you not stop saying
what is in yours?

372
00:47:41,044 --> 00:47:45,244
Why must you lead, when I want to lead?

373
00:47:45,314 --> 00:47:48,974
If I want to dance, I will ask you to dance.

374
00:47:49,054 --> 00:47:53,514
If I want to speak,
I will open my mouth and speak.

375
00:47:54,724 --> 00:47:57,924
Everyone is forever
plaguing me to speak further.

376
00:47:59,494 --> 00:48:01,754
Why? What good is it to tell you

377
00:48:01,834 --> 00:48:04,694
you are in my every thought
from the time I wake?

378
00:48:04,764 --> 00:48:08,324
What good can come from my saying
I- I sometimes cannot think clearly,

379
00:48:08,404 --> 00:48:11,304
or do my work properly?

380
00:48:11,374 --> 00:48:16,744
What gain can rise from my telling you
the only time I feel fear as others do...

381
00:48:18,544 --> 00:48:21,104
...is when I think of you in harm?

382
00:48:23,513 --> 00:48:26,643
That is why I am on this porch, Ivy Walker.

383
00:48:28,923 --> 00:48:32,013
I fear for your safety before all others.

384
00:48:36,563 --> 00:48:38,553
And, yes...

385
00:48:40,233 --> 00:48:43,363
...I will dance with you
on our wedding night.

386
00:49:02,253 --> 00:49:04,853
I had been to the storage shed
twice to fetch food

387
00:49:04,923 --> 00:49:07,053
prior to the wedding ceremony.

388
00:49:07,123 --> 00:49:10,353
And the livestock
was untouched at that time?

389
00:49:10,433 --> 00:49:13,833
Yes, Mrs. Hunt.
All was as it should be.

390
00:49:14,733 --> 00:49:17,133
Thank you, Beatrice.

391
00:49:24,012 --> 00:49:27,502
I beg your pardon.

392
00:49:27,582 --> 00:49:31,572
Is it true... about Lucius and Ivy?

393
00:49:32,952 --> 00:49:35,782
There are whispers all over the village.

394
00:49:39,062 --> 00:49:43,892
We were informed early this morning
of their intentions.

395
00:49:43,962 --> 00:49:48,802
It is amazing to witness
which two people love chooses to unite.

396
00:49:48,872 --> 00:49:51,432
It follows no rules.

397
00:49:52,172 --> 00:49:54,002
Kitty...

398
00:49:54,072 --> 00:49:57,402
I wanted to speak with you first.

399
00:49:57,472 --> 00:50:02,542
I would not want you to feel pain,
in any fashion.

400
00:50:02,612 --> 00:50:05,742
You are my cherished one.

401
00:50:05,822 --> 00:50:10,152
If you were to feel badly
about Lucius, I would not have it.

402
00:50:10,222 --> 00:50:14,422
One love to sacrifice
another love is not right.

403
00:50:19,362 --> 00:50:23,921
There is nothing you could do
that would sacrifice my love for you.

404
00:50:25,471 --> 00:50:28,531
You are my cherished one as well.

405
00:50:37,311 --> 00:50:40,181
God bless you and your life together.

406
00:51:00,501 --> 00:51:02,491
What's happened?

407
00:51:11,011 --> 00:51:13,921
Is this about Ivy and myself?

408
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:28,490
I know you are very fond of her.

409
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:31,060
And I know she is fond of you.

410
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:40,040
There are different types of love.

411
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:04,430
Oh.

412
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:12,630
Oh, God.

413
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:29,719
Oh, Ivy...

414
00:52:52,979 --> 00:52:55,139
Noah?

415
00:52:56,249 --> 00:53:02,619
You'll be late for the meeting hall. Would
you like your father to walk you there?

416
00:53:05,399 --> 00:53:07,229
Noah?

417
00:53:29,988 --> 00:53:31,578
Oh...

418
00:53:31,648 --> 00:53:34,558
The bad... The bad color.

419
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:38,918
Oh...

420
00:53:41,658 --> 00:53:45,358
The bad color, the bad color...

421
00:53:54,478 --> 00:53:55,998
Mama!

422
00:54:02,888 --> 00:54:04,978
- I beg your pardon.
- What is it?

423
00:54:05,048 --> 00:54:07,648
There's been an accident.

424
00:54:19,568 --> 00:54:25,167
Noah Percy was found with quarts
of blood upon his clothes and hands.

425
00:54:25,777 --> 00:54:28,897
The blood was not his own,
and he will not speak as to whose it is.

426
00:54:28,977 --> 00:54:32,107
God in heaven.

427
00:54:32,177 --> 00:54:33,267
Ivy!

428
00:54:34,317 --> 00:54:37,747
Is there anyone injured in here?

429
00:54:37,817 --> 00:54:40,477
Has anyone
been hurt in this home?

430
00:54:41,687 --> 00:54:43,717
Is anyone in here?

431
00:54:43,787 --> 00:54:46,727
Is anyone hurt in this house?

432
00:54:56,067 --> 00:54:59,527
22, 23, 24...

433
00:55:09,847 --> 00:55:13,047
31, 32, 33...

434
00:55:32,536 --> 00:55:34,366
Lucius?

435
00:55:36,776 --> 00:55:38,766
Lucius Hunt!

436
00:55:39,676 --> 00:55:43,346
You answer me right this moment!

437
00:56:07,436 --> 00:56:10,106
Is anyone hurt in this house?

438
00:56:12,116 --> 00:56:14,516
They're fine.

439
00:56:14,576 --> 00:56:16,576
Mr. Walker!

440
00:56:20,215 --> 00:56:22,205
Joseph!

441
00:56:26,255 --> 00:56:31,555
Papa... I cannot see his color.

442
00:56:36,705 --> 00:56:38,325
Ivy.

443
00:56:38,405 --> 00:56:40,395
Come away. Come away.

444
00:56:40,475 --> 00:56:42,965
Come away. Here, take her.

445
00:56:43,045 --> 00:56:45,335
Take her.

446
00:56:45,415 --> 00:56:48,345
No!

447
00:56:51,815 --> 00:56:54,445
He has suffered a great deal.

448
00:56:56,555 --> 00:56:59,075
He may pass at any time.

449
00:57:03,525 --> 00:57:07,295
Please give him all your prayers
and good thoughts.

450
00:57:07,365 --> 00:57:09,595
He will hear them.

451
00:58:00,014 --> 00:58:02,004
Turn!

452
00:58:26,243 --> 00:58:28,833
I am in love.

453
00:58:29,513 --> 00:58:31,503
I know.

454
00:58:32,453 --> 00:58:35,143
He is in love with me.

455
00:58:36,653 --> 00:58:38,643
I know.

456
00:58:39,823 --> 00:58:41,813
If he dies...

457
00:58:43,893 --> 00:58:46,723
...all that is life to me will die with him.

458
00:58:50,133 --> 00:58:52,863
I ask permission...

459
00:58:54,473 --> 00:58:57,403
...to travel through Covington Woods...

460
00:59:00,613 --> 00:59:03,603
...and go to the towns...

461
00:59:05,043 --> 00:59:08,013
...to retrieve medicines...

462
00:59:10,553 --> 00:59:13,083
...that may save...

463
00:59:15,123 --> 00:59:17,113
...Lucius Hunt.

464
00:59:27,902 --> 00:59:30,872
You are my father.

465
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:33,302
I will listen to you in all things.

466
00:59:36,042 --> 00:59:38,702
I will trust your decision.

467
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:49,612
I've done what I can to close
the wounds. There's an infection.

468
00:59:49,692 --> 00:59:52,352
What can be done to mend him?

469
00:59:54,062 --> 00:59:56,322
We can only pray.

470
00:59:58,102 --> 01:00:01,432
If there were no limitations,
what could be done?

471
01:00:03,602 --> 01:00:04,902
Hmm?

472
01:00:04,972 --> 01:00:07,302
What are you asking me?

473
01:00:11,412 --> 01:00:16,352
Is there anything at all
that can be done to mend the boy?

474
01:00:21,221 --> 01:00:25,211
Please, Victor. Would you be so kind
as to answer my question?

475
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:37,731
If the infection is contained,
he may still survive.

476
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:43,201
I must speak up.

477
01:00:44,811 --> 01:00:47,511
You have a restless spirit.

478
01:00:47,581 --> 01:00:50,111
I know the thing that is in your head.

479
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:55,581
You're thinking of going to the towns.

480
01:00:56,561 --> 01:00:58,891
Tell me I'm wrong.

481
01:01:00,391 --> 01:01:06,351
You have made an oath, Edward,
as all have, never to go back.

482
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:10,431
It is a painful bargain,
but no good can come without sacrifice.

483
01:01:10,501 --> 01:01:13,871
These are your words I'm saying.
You cannot break the oath.

484
01:01:13,941 --> 01:01:16,430
- It is sacred.
- It is a crime,

485
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:19,170
what has happened to Lucius.

486
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:23,180
You have taken the oath.

487
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:27,150
You and the rest of the elders...
Are you listening to me?

488
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:29,210
You...

489
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:33,220
...have taken the oath.

490
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:04,120
The moment I heard my daughter's
vision had finally failed her,

491
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:08,130
and that she would forever be blind,
I was sitting in that very chair.

492
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,590
I was so ashamed.

493
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:21,199
What do you know about your grandfather?

494
01:02:23,409 --> 01:02:26,569
He was the wealthiest man in the towns?

495
01:02:26,649 --> 01:02:29,809
That he was. He had a gift for that.

496
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:35,879
If he was given one dollar, in less than a
fortnight, he would have turned it into five.

497
01:02:36,789 --> 01:02:40,089
You do not know of money.
It is not part of our life here.

498
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:42,889
Money can be a wicked thing.

499
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:47,089
It can turn men's hearts black -
good men's hearts.

500
01:02:47,169 --> 01:02:50,929
My father could not see this.
For all his gifts,

501
01:02:50,999 --> 01:02:56,499
he was a poor judge of a man's character.
Your grandfather was a good man, Ivy.

502
01:02:56,579 --> 01:02:59,069
He had a laugh that could
be heard three houses away.

503
01:02:59,149 --> 01:03:02,209
He used to hold my hand as I hold yours.

504
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:05,309
He taught me strength
and showed me love,

505
01:03:05,379 --> 01:03:11,449
and told me to lead
when others would only follow.

506
01:03:16,398 --> 01:03:19,018
Your grandfather, James Walker,
died in his sleep.

507
01:03:19,098 --> 01:03:22,828
A man put a gun to his head
and shot him while he dreamed.

508
01:03:22,898 --> 01:03:28,968
I tell you this so you will understand
some of the reasons for my actions,

509
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:30,768
and...

510
01:03:32,778 --> 01:03:35,108
...and the actions of others.

511
01:03:38,048 --> 01:03:42,448
You are a strong one, Ivy.
You lead when others would follow.

512
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:46,478
You see light
when there is only darkness.

513
01:03:51,228 --> 01:03:53,558
I trust you.

514
01:03:55,428 --> 01:03:59,298
I trust you among all others.

515
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:05,228
Thank you, Father.

516
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:07,938
Ivy, do you know where you are?

517
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:12,138
At the old shed that is not to be used.

518
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:16,807
Yeah.

519
01:04:19,787 --> 01:04:22,157
- Ivy.
- Yes, Father?

520
01:04:23,457 --> 01:04:25,947
Do your very best not to scream.

521
01:04:33,307 --> 01:04:35,737
What?

522
01:05:07,137 --> 01:05:11,907
I am leaving to fetch you medicines.

523
01:05:13,607 --> 01:05:16,406
I had a difficult time getting away.

524
01:05:16,476 --> 01:05:18,466
What is it?

525
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:29,246
Ivy...

526
01:05:29,326 --> 01:05:31,316
...has asked...

527
01:05:32,466 --> 01:05:35,326
...to go to the towns...

528
01:05:35,396 --> 01:05:38,336
...for medicines.

529
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:20,294
Christop.

530
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:26,734
Christop...

531
01:07:26,804 --> 01:07:29,204
you needn't be scared.

532
01:07:30,314 --> 01:07:32,374
We have the magic rocks.

533
01:07:32,444 --> 01:07:34,474
They will keep us safe.

534
01:07:35,884 --> 01:07:39,644
Why have we not heard
of these rocks before?

535
01:07:40,224 --> 01:07:43,884
Christop, please.
Do not leave us.

536
01:07:43,954 --> 01:07:46,114
There is nothing to fear.

537
01:07:48,094 --> 01:07:50,994
Then why do you wear the cloak
of the safe color?

538
01:07:51,064 --> 01:07:53,824
We will light torches.

539
01:07:53,904 --> 01:07:56,694
It will be safe.

540
01:07:56,774 --> 01:07:58,764
It is forbidden.

541
01:08:00,374 --> 01:08:02,364
Christop.

542
01:08:49,923 --> 01:08:51,853
Ivy...

543
01:08:51,923 --> 01:08:54,683
there's something in these woods.

544
01:08:56,063 --> 01:08:58,493
It turns my stomach to rot.

545
01:09:06,173 --> 01:09:11,443
You will be safe. They will not harm you,
because you cannot see.

546
01:09:11,513 --> 01:09:14,502
They will take pity on you,
the way they took pity on Noah

547
01:09:14,582 --> 01:09:17,242
when... when he ventured in the woods.

548
01:09:20,082 --> 01:09:23,022
They will kill me, Ivy.

549
01:09:23,852 --> 01:09:26,052
I cannot stay.

550
01:09:32,062 --> 01:09:36,262
You're better in these woods
than most boys. Anyone would say so.

551
01:09:36,332 --> 01:09:39,162
It is my burden, Finton.

552
01:09:41,102 --> 01:09:43,632
- You may go.
- Come with me.

553
01:10:11,601 --> 01:10:14,031
Do your very best not to scream.

554
01:10:28,681 --> 01:10:31,181
There's an odd smell.

555
01:10:35,921 --> 01:10:38,421
It is ahead of you.

556
01:10:40,101 --> 01:10:42,691
What is it?

557
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:45,331
I cannot explain in words.

558
01:10:46,871 --> 01:10:49,431
It is just a few steps.

559
01:11:01,181 --> 01:11:06,381
- Those We Don't Speak Of!
- Do not be frightened.

560
01:11:07,191 --> 01:11:10,351
It is only farce.

561
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:16,530
Do not be frightened.

562
01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:32,810
There did exist rumors
of creatures in these woods.

563
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:36,870
It is in one of the history books
I used to teach in the towns.

564
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:41,090
The screams from the woods?

565
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:46,090
We created those sounds.

566
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,690
The Ceremony of Meat?

567
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:53,200
We remove it ourselves.
An elder is always assigned.

568
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:56,600
The drills -
they are farce, too?

569
01:11:56,670 --> 01:12:00,010
We did not want anyone
to go to the towns, Ivy.

570
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:07,080
What about the animals -
the skinned ones?

571
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:12,279
- Are the elders responsible for that, too?
- I believe one of the elders is responsible.

572
01:12:12,349 --> 01:12:14,619
It will not happen again.

573
01:12:14,689 --> 01:12:18,589
There is no one in this village
who has not lost someone irreplaceable,

574
01:12:18,659 --> 01:12:25,329
who has not felt loss so deeply that they
questioned the very merit of living at all.

575
01:12:25,399 --> 01:12:27,889
It is a darkness I wished...

576
01:12:28,899 --> 01:12:31,239
...you would never know.

577
01:12:33,539 --> 01:12:38,879
Forgive us our silly lies, Ivy.
They were not meant to harm.

578
01:12:46,919 --> 01:12:52,049
I am... sad for you, Papa.

579
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:56,999
For all the elders.

580
01:13:06,339 --> 01:13:11,178
On this paper has been written
a tool of medicine.

581
01:13:11,248 --> 01:13:13,268
It is common in the towns.

582
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:16,978
You will go... with two escorts.

583
01:13:17,648 --> 01:13:20,178
Follow the sounds of the stream.

584
01:13:20,258 --> 01:13:23,618
A half day's journey
will bring you to a hidden road.

585
01:13:23,688 --> 01:13:27,888
At this hidden road, the two escorts
will wait as you continue.

586
01:13:27,958 --> 01:13:32,128
You alone will follow the road...

587
01:13:33,668 --> 01:13:36,928
...and leave Covington Woods.

588
01:13:37,008 --> 01:13:41,868
You are to tell no one
in the towns where we are...

589
01:13:41,938 --> 01:13:44,338
...and return with haste.

590
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:49,418
I cannot come with you.

591
01:13:53,858 --> 01:13:56,948
You gave your heart to this boy.

592
01:13:58,858 --> 01:14:01,118
He is in need.

593
01:14:02,558 --> 01:14:06,158
Are you ready to take this burden,

594
01:14:06,228 --> 01:14:11,227
which, by right,
is yours and yours alone?

595
01:14:19,247 --> 01:14:23,947
I am making fresh cloths for Lucius.
He needs them.

596
01:14:24,017 --> 01:14:26,277
Alice, I've sent for help.

597
01:14:31,657 --> 01:14:33,647
I've sent Ivy to the towns.

598
01:14:36,327 --> 01:14:38,317
You cannot.

599
01:14:40,637 --> 01:14:43,127
It is all that I can give you.

600
01:14:51,247 --> 01:14:53,737
It is all that I can give you.

601
01:14:58,087 --> 01:15:00,077
I accept.

602
01:15:20,336 --> 01:15:25,966
- What have you done?
- He is the victim of a crime.

603
01:15:26,046 --> 01:15:29,706
We have agreed never to go back. Never.

604
01:15:29,786 --> 01:15:32,276
What was the purpose of our leaving?

605
01:15:32,346 --> 01:15:37,486
Let us not forget it was out of hope
of something good and right.

606
01:15:37,556 --> 01:15:39,786
You should not have made
decisions without us.

607
01:15:39,856 --> 01:15:42,886
- You have gone too far.
- I'm guilty, Robert!

608
01:15:44,496 --> 01:15:48,626
I made a decision of the heart.
I cannot look into another's eyes

609
01:15:48,696 --> 01:15:54,106
and see the same look
I see in August's without justification!

610
01:15:54,176 --> 01:15:57,296
It is too painful. I cannot bear it!

611
01:15:57,376 --> 01:16:00,466
You have jeopardized
everything we've made.

612
01:16:04,346 --> 01:16:08,016
Who do you think
will continue this place, this life?

613
01:16:10,555 --> 01:16:13,045
Do you plan to live forever?

614
01:16:14,725 --> 01:16:17,025
It is in them that our future lies.

615
01:16:17,095 --> 01:16:21,795
It is in Ivy and Lucius that
this... this way of life will continue.

616
01:16:22,735 --> 01:16:25,865
Yes, I have risked! I hope I am always able

617
01:16:25,935 --> 01:16:29,635
to risk everything
for the just and right cause.

618
01:16:33,175 --> 01:16:37,945
If we did not make this decision, we could
never again call ourselves innocent.

619
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:43,355
And that, in the end, is what we
have protected here - innocence!

620
01:16:44,525 --> 01:16:47,185
That, I'm not ready to give up.

621
01:16:53,865 --> 01:16:55,925
Let her go.

622
01:16:58,405 --> 01:17:00,735
If it ends, it ends.

623
01:17:04,505 --> 01:17:08,844
We can move towards hope.
It's what's beautiful about this place.

624
01:17:09,914 --> 01:17:12,844
We must not run from heartache.

625
01:17:13,854 --> 01:17:15,874
You know, my brother
was slain in the towns.

626
01:17:15,954 --> 01:17:17,944
The rest of my family died here.

627
01:17:18,024 --> 01:17:21,514
Heartache is a part of life.
We know that now.

628
01:17:21,594 --> 01:17:24,454
Ivy's running toward hope.
Let her run.

629
01:17:25,694 --> 01:17:29,654
If this place is worthy,
she'll be successful in her quest.

630
01:17:32,564 --> 01:17:35,034
How could you have sent her?

631
01:17:35,104 --> 01:17:37,264
She's blind.

632
01:17:38,374 --> 01:17:42,174
She's more capable
than most in this village...

633
01:17:43,214 --> 01:17:46,974
...and she is led by love.

634
01:17:47,054 --> 01:17:50,504
The world moves for love.

635
01:17:52,754 --> 01:17:55,524
It kneels before it in awe.

636
01:18:07,274 --> 01:18:11,103
# All the world to see

637
01:18:11,173 --> 01:18:15,373
# Time to look about and know

638
01:18:15,443 --> 01:18:19,573
# How the shadows come and go

639
01:18:19,643 --> 01:18:23,813
# How the breeze stirs the trees

640
01:18:23,883 --> 01:18:28,013
# How the blossoms grow

641
01:18:28,093 --> 01:18:32,153
# Sleep, baby, sleep

642
01:18:32,223 --> 01:18:36,063
# Sleep, gently sleep

643
01:20:51,401 --> 01:20:56,061
There did exist rumors
of creatures in these woods.

644
01:20:56,131 --> 01:20:58,661
It is in one of the history books
I used to teach in the towns.

645
01:23:24,518 --> 01:23:26,918
It is not real.

646
01:23:27,248 --> 01:23:29,348
It is not real.

647
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:10,695
Noah?

648
01:26:13,475 --> 01:26:16,775
- Oh, my God. What is this?
- What is this?

649
01:26:16,845 --> 01:26:18,905
Where is he?

650
01:26:23,155 --> 01:26:26,025
He found one of the suits
we kept under the floorboards.

651
01:26:26,095 --> 01:26:28,185
Oh, no.

652
01:26:28,265 --> 01:26:30,495
Oh, God.

653
01:26:30,565 --> 01:26:32,755
The animals.

654
01:27:59,384 --> 01:28:02,214
His will to live is very strong.

655
01:28:43,723 --> 01:28:48,323
A half day's journey
will bring you to a hidden road.

656
01:28:48,403 --> 01:28:52,703
You alone will follow the road...

657
01:28:54,173 --> 01:28:56,663
...and leave Covington Woods.

658
01:28:58,273 --> 01:29:02,402
You are to tell no one
in the towns where we are...

659
01:29:03,282 --> 01:29:05,642
...and return with haste.

660
01:31:12,110 --> 01:31:16,740
My sister did not live
past her 23rd birthday.

661
01:31:16,810 --> 01:31:20,510
A group of men raped and killed her.

662
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:23,810
They stuffed her in a Dumpster...

663
01:31:25,150 --> 01:31:28,420
three blocks from our apartment.

664
01:31:28,490 --> 01:31:32,430
My brother worked
in an emergency room downtown.

665
01:31:32,490 --> 01:31:36,830
A drug addict came in
with a wound to his ribs.

666
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:39,590
My brother tried to dress the wound.

667
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:43,470
He pulled a gun from his jacket...

668
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:47,500
...then he shot my brother
through his left eye.

669
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:49,770
My husband, Michael,

670
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:54,210
left for the supermarket
at a quarter past nine in the morning.

671
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:59,620
He was found
with no money and no clothes

672
01:31:59,690 --> 01:32:02,279
in the East River, three days later.

673
01:32:02,359 --> 01:32:07,019
My father was shot
by a business partner,

674
01:32:07,089 --> 01:32:10,959
who then hanged himself
in my father's closet.

675
01:32:11,029 --> 01:32:13,729
They had argued over money.

676
01:32:13,799 --> 01:32:15,829
I am a professor.

677
01:32:15,899 --> 01:32:21,469
I teach American History
at the University of Pennsylvania.

678
01:32:21,539 --> 01:32:23,909
I have an idea...

679
01:32:24,879 --> 01:32:27,709
...that I would like to talk to you about.

680
01:32:29,879 --> 01:32:33,339
Mile 27- there's a girl.
I'm gonna check it out.

681
01:32:33,419 --> 01:32:35,749
Be careful.

682
01:32:56,809 --> 01:32:59,838
You're not allowed to go in there.

683
01:32:59,908 --> 01:33:02,108
Please return to your vehicle.

684
01:33:02,178 --> 01:33:04,668
What was that noise?

685
01:33:07,618 --> 01:33:11,558
What are you doing out here?
How... how'd you get here?

686
01:33:11,628 --> 01:33:13,958
Are you from the towns?

687
01:33:15,498 --> 01:33:17,018
Uh...

688
01:33:17,098 --> 01:33:19,428
Where are you from?

689
01:33:22,398 --> 01:33:25,068
The woods.

690
01:33:28,108 --> 01:33:30,868
You came from the woods?

691
01:33:32,978 --> 01:33:35,348
In there?

692
01:33:36,448 --> 01:33:39,008
Will you help me?

693
01:33:39,648 --> 01:33:43,448
I need to find a doctor of medicine.

694
01:33:43,518 --> 01:33:45,788
I must find these things.
We must make haste.

695
01:33:45,858 --> 01:33:48,228
Listen, ma'am.

696
01:33:49,358 --> 01:33:51,698
I'm just supposed to...

697
01:34:10,117 --> 01:34:12,637
Is someone hurt?

698
01:34:14,387 --> 01:34:16,717
Please, sir. We must make haste.

699
01:34:22,157 --> 01:34:25,427
- Well, you... you live in there?
- I do, sir.

700
01:34:34,537 --> 01:34:36,767
Breaker.

701
01:34:38,947 --> 01:34:41,537
- What is your name?
- Kevin.

702
01:34:42,147 --> 01:34:44,137
Kevin.

703
01:34:45,247 --> 01:34:47,577
You have kindness in your voice.

704
01:34:49,317 --> 01:34:51,877
I did not expect that.

705
01:34:57,727 --> 01:35:01,166
We have guard shacks every ten miles
around the perimeter of the preserve.

706
01:35:01,236 --> 01:35:06,756
We keep medical supplies in there
in case of animal bites or related injuries.

707
01:35:06,836 --> 01:35:10,106
You can find the things
written on the paper?

708
01:35:11,476 --> 01:35:13,636
Uh...

709
01:35:13,706 --> 01:35:16,706
- You have to wait here.
- Please, sir.

710
01:35:16,776 --> 01:35:19,146
Please... take this as payment.

711
01:35:26,186 --> 01:35:28,656
Wait, y-you're not...

712
01:35:28,726 --> 01:35:31,486
You're not tricking me, are you?

713
01:35:31,566 --> 01:35:34,556
I do not understand.

714
01:35:36,736 --> 01:35:39,366
What's your name?

715
01:35:39,436 --> 01:35:41,426
Ivy.

716
01:35:43,336 --> 01:35:46,106
Ivy Elizabeth Walker.

717
01:35:48,716 --> 01:35:50,306
There's an overturned tractor-trailer

718
01:35:50,376 --> 01:35:52,816
causing a one-hour delay
at the Lincoln Tunnel.

719
01:35:52,886 --> 01:35:55,076
The body of seven-year-old
Katrina Nelson was found today.

720
01:35:55,156 --> 01:35:57,206
She'd been missing for three days.

721
01:35:57,286 --> 01:36:01,555
Another 14 soldiers died in combat
when a bomb exploded in their convoy.

722
01:36:01,625 --> 01:36:03,025
It's 35 degrees outside.

723
01:36:05,565 --> 01:36:08,355
What's with the girl?
I tried calling you back on the walkie.

724
01:36:08,435 --> 01:36:11,025
- You didn't answer.
- Oh, it was just some teenagers.

725
01:36:11,105 --> 01:36:13,865
They were lost.

726
01:36:13,935 --> 01:36:18,275
Can I give you some advice?
Don't get into conversations.

727
01:36:18,345 --> 01:36:22,475
You start talkin', you start gettin' into
how some estate is payin' all of us,

728
01:36:22,545 --> 01:36:25,985
and no one's allowed to go in there
and disturb the animal sanctuary.

729
01:36:26,045 --> 01:36:28,535
People's interest gets piqued.

730
01:36:28,615 --> 01:36:32,455
It's a really easy gig, Kevin.
Maintain and protect the border.

731
01:36:32,525 --> 01:36:36,515
That's it. A few years ago,

732
01:36:36,595 --> 01:36:39,565
it got out in the papers that some
government guys had been paid off

733
01:36:39,625 --> 01:36:43,395
to keep plane routes
from flying over this place.

734
01:36:43,465 --> 01:36:45,795
That was a very
stressful time for me.

735
01:36:45,865 --> 01:36:48,025
Don't cause me any troubles.

736
01:36:48,105 --> 01:36:50,665
Do not get into conversations.

737
01:37:42,094 --> 01:37:45,024
Hey, Jay,
where's the maintenance ladder?

738
01:37:47,394 --> 01:37:49,724
I n-need to fix a sign.

739
01:37:51,234 --> 01:37:53,224
It's in the back.

740
01:39:02,702 --> 01:39:05,102
Ivy has returned
with medicines from the towns.

741
01:39:05,172 --> 01:39:08,162
She was attacked
by a creature and killed it.

742
01:39:19,952 --> 01:39:21,282
Noah.

743
01:39:21,352 --> 01:39:23,842
Oh, God.

744
01:39:23,922 --> 01:39:26,252
We will find him.

745
01:39:29,092 --> 01:39:31,252
We will give him...

746
01:39:33,132 --> 01:39:35,122
...a proper burial.

747
01:39:38,042 --> 01:39:40,372
We will tell the others...

748
01:39:43,572 --> 01:39:46,302
...he was killed by the creatures.

749
01:39:50,652 --> 01:39:53,512
Your son has made our stories real.

750
01:39:57,751 --> 01:40:01,321
Noah has given us a chance
to continue this place...

751
01:40:05,431 --> 01:40:07,991
...if that is something...

752
01:40:11,071 --> 01:40:13,401
...we still wish for.

753
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:27,900
I'm back, Lucius.

754
01:41:34,005 --> 01:41:41,005
<i>Hope You Enjoyed! :)
