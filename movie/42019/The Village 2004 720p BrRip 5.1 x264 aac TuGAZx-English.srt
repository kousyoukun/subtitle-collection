Why'd you tell me this blackness?

So you will know the nature

My intentions are true to my word.

What is your meaning?

There are secrets
in every corner of this village.

Do you not feel it? Do you not see it?

248
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,168
That is for my own well-being,

249
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:10,341
so the evil things from my past
are kept close and not forgotten.

250

Forgetting would be to let them
be born again in another form.

- He may be able...
- He hides, too.

so we don't do them.

She's found love, again,

You know, he won't sit back in his chair
for fear of setting wrinkles on his shirts.

You have made an oath, Edward,

lt is a painful bargain,
but no good can come without sacrifice.

You and the rest of the elders...

You...

...have taken the oath.

566
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:05,185
The moment l heard my daughter's
vision had finally failed her,

567
01:02:05,255 --> 01:02:09,191
and that she would forever be blind,
l was sitting in that very chair.

568
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:14,656

569
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:22,269
What do you know about your grandfather?

570
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:27,637
He was the wealthiest man in the towns?

571
01:02:27,711 --> 01:02:30,874
That he was. He had a gift for that.

572
01:02:30,947 --> 01:02:36,943
lf he was given one dollar, in less than a
fortnight, he would have turned it into five.

573
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:41,153
You do not know of money.
lt is not part of our life here.

Money can be a wicked thing.

good men's hearts.

My father could not see this.
For all his gifts,

577
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:57,563
he was a poor judge of a man's character.
Your grandfather was a good man, lvy.

578
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,131
He had a laugh that could
be heard three houses away.

579
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:03,270
He used to hold my hand as l hold yours.

580
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:06,372
He taught me strength
and showed me love,

581
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:12,513
and told me to lead
when others would only follow.

582
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,088
Your grandfather, James Walker,
died in his sleep.

583
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:23,894
A man put a gun to his head
and shot him while he dreamed.

584
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:30,031
l tell you this so you will understand
some of the reasons for my actions,

You are a strong one, lvy.
You lead when others would follow.

01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:43,764
<i>(Ivy)</i> What is it?

639
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,400
<i>(Walker)</i> l cannot explain in words.

640
01:10:47,944 --> 01:10:50,504
lt is just a few steps.

641
01:11:00,857 --> 01:11:02,188
<i>(screams)</i>

642
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:07,457
- Those We Don't Speak Of!
- Do not be frightened.

643
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:11,427
lt is only farce.

644
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:17,602
Do not be frightened.

645
01:11:28,084 --> 01:11:33,886
There did exist rumors
of creatures in these woods.

646
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:37,949
lt is in one of the history books
l used to teach in the towns.

647
01:11:38,828 --> 01:11:42,161
The screams from the woods?

648
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,163
We created those sounds.

649
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:49,761
The Ceremony of Meat?

650
01:11:49,839 --> 01:11:54,276
We remove it ourselves.
An elder is always assigned.

651
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:57,676
The drills -
they are farce, too?

652
01:11:57,747 --> 01:12:01,080
We did not want anyone
to go to the towns, lvy.

653
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:08,153
What about the animals -
the skinned ones?

654
01:12:08,224 --> 01:12:13,355
- Are the elders responsible for that, too?
- l believe one of the elders is responsible.

655
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:15,693
lt will not happen again.

656
01:12:15,765 --> 01:12:19,667
There is no one in this village
who has not lost someone irreplaceable,

657
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:26,402
who has not felt loss so deeply that they
questioned the very merit of living at all.

658
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:28,966
lt is a darkness l wished...

659
01:12:29,979 --> 01:12:32,311
...you would never know.

660
01:12:34,617 --> 01:12:39,953
Forgive us our silly lies, lvy.
They were not meant to harm.

661
01:12:47,997 --> 01:12:53,128
l am... sad for you, Papa.

662
01:12:55,237 --> 01:12:58,070
For all the elders.

663
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:12,251
On this paper has been written
a tool of medicine.

664
01:13:12,321 --> 01:13:14,346
lt is common in the towns.

665
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:18,052
You will go... with two escorts.

666
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:21,253
Follow the sounds of the stream.

667
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:24,697
A half day's journey
will bring you to a hidden road.

668
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:28,965
At this hidden road, the two escorts
will wait as you continue.

669
01:13:29,038 --> 01:13:33,202
You alone will follow the road...

670
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:38,009
...and leave Covington Woods.

671
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:42,949
You are to tell no one
in the towns where we are...

672
01:13:43,019 --> 01:13:45,419
...and return with haste.

673
01:13:48,124 --> 01:13:50,490
l cannot come with you.

674
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:58,024
You gave your heart to this boy.

675
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:02,199
He is in need.

676
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:07,234
Are you ready to take this burden,

677
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:12,303
which, by right,
is yours and yours alone?

678
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:25,021
l am making fresh cloths for Lucius.
He needs them.

679
01:14:25,094 --> 01:14:27,358
Alice, l've sent for help.

680
01:14:32,735 --> 01:14:34,726
l've sent lvy to the towns.

681
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:39,397
You cannot.

682
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:44,201
lt is all that l can give you.

683
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:54,812
lt is all that l can give you.

684
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,152
l accept.

685
01:15:21,417 --> 01:15:27,049
- What have you done?
- He is the victim of a crime.

686
01:15:27,123 --> 01:15:30,786
We have agreed never to go back. Never.

687
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,351
What was the purpose of our leaving?

688
01:15:33,429 --> 01:15:38,560
Let us not forget it was out of hope
of something good and right.

689
01:15:38,634 --> 01:15:40,864
You should not have made
decisions without us.

690
01:15:40,936 --> 01:15:43,962
- You have gone too far.
- l'm guilty, Robert!

691
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:49,704
l made a decision of the heart.
l cannot look into another's eyes

692
01:15:49,778 --> 01:15:55,182
and see the same look
l see in August's without justification!

693
01:15:55,251 --> 01:15:58,379
lt is too painful. l cannot bear it!

694
01:15:58,454 --> 01:16:01,548
You have jeopardized
everything we've made.

695
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:09,090
Who do you think
will continue this place, this life?

696
01:16:11,634 --> 01:16:14,125
Do you plan to live forever?

697
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:18,102
lt is in them that our future lies.

698
01:16:18,174 --> 01:16:22,873
lt is in lvy and Lucius that
this... this way of life will continue.

699
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:26,940
Yes, l have risked! l hope l am always able

700
01:16:27,016 --> 01:16:30,713
to risk everything
for the just and right cause.

701
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:39,023
lf we did not make this decision, we could
never again call ourselves innocent.

702
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:44,430
And that, in the end, is what we
have protected here - innocence!

703
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:48,263
That, l'm not ready to give up.

704
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:57,003
Let her go.

705
01:16:59,481 --> 01:17:01,813
lf it ends, it ends.

706
01:17:05,588 --> 01:17:09,922
We can move towards hope.
lt's what's beautiful about this place.

707
01:17:10,993 --> 01:17:13,928
We must not run from heartache.

708
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:16,955
You know, my brother
was slain in the towns.

709
01:17:17,032 --> 01:17:19,023
The rest of my family died here.

710
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:22,593
Heartache is a part of life.
We know that now.

711
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:25,538
lvy's running toward hope.
Let her run.

712
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:30,734
lf this place is worthy,
she'll be successful in her quest.

713
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:36,117
How could you have sent <i>her?</i>

714
01:17:36,185 --> 01:17:38,346
She's blind.

715
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:43,255
She's more capable
than most in this village...

716
01:17:44,293 --> 01:17:48,059
...and she is led by love.

717
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:51,588
The world moves for love.

718
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:56,600
lt kneels before it in awe.

719
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:12,184
? All the world to see

720
01:18:12,254 --> 01:18:16,452
? Time to look about and know

721
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:20,655
? How the shadows come and go

722
01:18:20,729 --> 01:18:24,893
? How the breeze stirs the trees

723
01:18:24,967 --> 01:18:29,097
? How the blossoms grow

724
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:33,232
? Sleep, baby, sleep

725
01:18:33,309 --> 01:18:37,143
? Sleep, gently sleep
