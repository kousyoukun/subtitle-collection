00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,500
greetings from roNy
300MBUNiTED

3
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,060
(very quietly)
Who'll pinch me to wake me up?

4
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,140
Who will laugh at me when I fall?

5
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,610
Whose breath will I listen for...

6
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,410
...so that I may sleep?

7
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,780
Whose hand will I hold...

8
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,790
...so that I may walk?

9
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:13,180
(man) We may question ourselves
at moments such as these.

10
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,590
Did we make the right decision
to settle here?

11
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,800
We are grateful for the time
we have been given.

12
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,720
(murmuring)

13
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,490
(thunderclap)

14
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,960
(moaning)

15
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,850
(rumbling)

16
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,200
What manner of spectacle has attracted
your attention so splendidly?

17
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,480
I ought to carry it in my pocket
to help me teach.

18
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,910
(flies buzzing)

19
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,920
Who came upon this?

20
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,030
- Philip, did you move this?
- No, Mr. Walker.

21
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,090
(flies buzzing)

22
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:57,640
I inspected it carefully. Its head was
twisted back and much of its fur removed.

23
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:01,080
- I see.
- It was murdered.

24
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,480
But who is the culprit?

25
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,110
Who has done this heinous act?

26
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,590
- Those We Don't Speak Of killed it.
- There it is.

27
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,420
Why would such a notion
come into your mind?

28
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,820
- They're meat eaters.
- Mmm.

29
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,930
They have large claws.

30
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,990
Children...

31
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:29,940
...Those We Don't Speak Of have not
breached our borders for many years.

32
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,140
We do not go into their woods,

33
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,450
they do not come into our valley.

34
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,510
It is a truce.

35
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,080
We do not threaten them.

36
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,150
Why would they do this?

37
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,250
And we ought not to overlook
the Flight of the Birds.

38
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:53,770
We didn't have it last year
and l, for one, missed it desperately.

39
00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:00,000
And I know your wife missed
the children dressed in feathers and such.

40
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,570
- I am fond of it.
- Mmm.

41
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,040
I do not have a say in this matter.

42
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,740
August Nicholson is chair
of today's meeting.

43
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,180
(door opens)

44
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:16,190
There's a young man who has
requested a word with the elders.

45
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,750
Well, do have him come forward.

46
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,530
Alice.

47
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,430
(August) Hello, Lucius.

48
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,600
"My mother is unaware
of the reason for my visit today."

49
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,120
"She did not give her consent
or consult me in any form."

50
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,850
"The passing of little
Daniel Nicholson from illness,

51
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,790
and other events,
have weighed on my thoughts."

52
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:57,090
"l ask permission to cross
into the forbidden woods

53
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,290
and travel to the nearest town."

54
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,530
"l will gather new medicines,
and I will return."

55
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,330
"With regards to
Those We Don't Speak Of,

56
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,070
I am certain they will let me pass."

57
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,770
"Creatures can sense emotion and fear."

58
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,540
"They will see I am pure of intention,
and not afraid."

59
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,610
"The end."

60
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,030
(Alice) What goes on
in that head of yours?

61
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,860
Say something, Lucius.

62
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:43,110
Finton Coin is in the tower,
and I've promised to sit with him.

63
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,170
Hmm.

64
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,780
Do you ever think of the towns, Finton?

65
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,320
The towns?

66
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,050
What for?

67
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,420
They're wicked places
where wicked people live. That's all.

68
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,970
Thank you, Lucius.

69
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,200
You're a good friend.

70
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,610
I do hope no one saw you.

71
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,510
(howling)

72
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,620
(flies buzzing)

73
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,610
What we seem to have amongst us
is a predator of some type,

74
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,840
most likely a coyote or a wolf.

75
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,080
Its manner of... of killing
and removing the fur,

76
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,480
but leaving the flesh torn,

77
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:04,750
may be a sign that this animal
suffers from madness.

78
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,790
And for the next fortnight,
we should be vigilant

79
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,300
for sightings of this coyote.

80
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,860
Keep careful watch over
our little ones as they play on the hills.

81
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,140
As for the other notion...

82
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:27,580
...we do not believe
our boundary has been breached.

83
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:34,210
Those We Don't Speak Of are much
larger creatures than coyotes...

84
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,720
...and we would know
if they had been here.

85
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,020
(murmuring)

86
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,220
(door opens)

87
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,560
Ahh, it's frightful, this business
with the coyote. Is it not, Papa?

88
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,690
- Do not feel worried, Kitty.
- You are not troubled?

89
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,170
I'm certain it will all end soon.

90
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,010
- Can we speak on other matters, then?
- It would be a relief.

91
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,140
I'm in love!

92
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,880
I want your permission
to marry, Papa.

93
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,420
There's a proper manner in which
things are supposed to happen.

94
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,080
Such as the boy would normally be
standing next to you,

95
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,680
in a moment such as this...
Where is the boy in all this, Kitty?

96
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,250
I haven't spoken to him as of yet.

97
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:18,090
The young man is unaware
of your intentions?

98
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:22,930
He has a quiet way. I was going to talk with
him, Papa, but not without your blessings.

99
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,200
I won't talk with him without your blessings.

100
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,670
Kitty!

101
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,000
It's Lucius Hunt.

102
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,040
Lucius?

103
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,170
You think badly of him?

104
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,950
- No, no. I have been thinking about him.
- He's not like the other boys, Papa.

105
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,080
He doesn't joke or bounce about.

106
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,390
No, he certainly does not.

107
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,760
Do I have your blessings, then?

108
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,060
(sighs)

109
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,900
Look, do me one favor first.

110
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:04,430
Do not tell anyone else of your burstings
until you have spoken with the young man.

111
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:13,180
Good afternoon, Lucius.

112
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,320
I wanted to... to... to tell you something.

113
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,560
I love you, Lucius.

114
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:31,430
I love you... Iike the day is long.

115
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,100
I love you more than
the sun and the moon together.

116
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:38,770
And if you feel the same way,
then we should not hide it any longer.

117
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,680
It's a gift, love is.
We should be thankful.

118
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,980
We should bellow it out
with all the breath in our lungs.

119
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,920
Thank you! Thank you!

120
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,390
Thank you!

121
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,030
(screaming and sobbing)

122
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,860
Shh, shh.

123
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,200
Shh.

124
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,900
(sobbing)

125
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:12,240
# Baby, sleep, gently sleep

126
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:17,910
# Life is long and love is deep

127
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:23,550
# Time will be sweet for thee

128
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,150
# All the world to see

129
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:31,560
# Time to look about and know

130
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:35,620
# How the shadows come and go

131
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:41,610
# How the breeze stirs the trees

132
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,010
# How the blossoms grow

133
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:02,620
I often wondered if you and my son bonded
because neither of you is fond of speaking.

134
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,760
You're very kind.

135
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:08,820
You must pardon my manners.
I haven't slept in many nights.

136
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,910
(man) You are doing capital,
Jamison.

137
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,780
Just a few more moments, huh?
Gather your bravery.

138
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:28,150
Do not jostle about so. You'll ruin my shirt.

139
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,450
(whimpering)

140
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
(howling)

141
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:38,500
They made a sound when I made a sound,
and they mimic before they attack.

142
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,190
Have courage, man.
That's a wives' tale. It isn't true.

143
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,970
Do not falter. Steel yourself!

144
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,070
(August) You know,
like a dog can smell you.

145
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,210
- Pardon me, Mr. Nicholson?
- Hmm.

146
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,650
You may run from sorrow, as we have.

147
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,390
Sorrow will find you.

148
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,760
It can smell you.

149
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,650
(rustling)

150
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,750
(breathing heavily)

151
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,520
(rustling continues)

152
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,430
(footsteps)

153
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,360
(growl)

154
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:49,100
(whimpering)

155
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,160
(howling)

156
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,930
Hurry.

157
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,780
I didn't know you could run so fast.

158
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,580
We're still for running and staying... Hey!

159
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:14,590
(Kitty) Noah ought to be punished. He
whacked little Joseph with a stick again.

160
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,650
(crowd groans)

161
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,160
- Ouch!
- (girl) No more hitting! Put it down!

162
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,460
Ow, ow, ow!

163
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,500
(girl #2) Why don't they grab it?

164
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,760
(distant shouting)

165
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,840
(woman) Noah Percy!

166
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,550
Stop your fussing right this moment.

167
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,560
(murmuring and laughing)

168
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,390
You're in trouble, you know.

169
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,630
- No hitting, no hitting.
- I'm to place you in the quiet room.

170
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,470
Um, I'll cry quarts.

171
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:07,000
- What if we strike a deal?
- Yeah, capital idea.

172
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,850
It would be prudent to keep our deal
a secret. Can you do that?

173
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,080
Can I keep a secret?
Like a church mouse.

174
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,550
You needn't go to the quiet room
if you a take an oath

175
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,960
to never strike any person again.

176
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,260
- No hitting, no hitting.
- No. No hitting.

177
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,730
- No hitting.
- No hitting.

178
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,790
No hitting.

179
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,940
The deal is struck.

180
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,210
(sighs)

181
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,580
We ought not return right away, huh?

182
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:47,610
What shall we do
with our stolen time?

183
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,350
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

184
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,320
- Hmm. Shall we have a foot race?
- Yes.

185
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,920
- Up the hill to the resting rock?
- No cheating.

186
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,960
What a deeply scandalous thing to say.
I insist you take that back.

187
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,360
Is that the school bell?

188
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,730
(shouting)

189
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:10,170
Ivy, you cheated!

190
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,580
I know! I'm sorry!

191
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,780
(giggling)

192
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,610
Whoo!

193
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,170
My sister cried a lot.

194
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,940
You wonder how I recognized you?

195
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:53,280
Some people - just a handful,
mind you - give off the tiniest color.

196
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,650
It's faint, like a haze.

197
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,250
It's the only thing
I ever see in the darkness.

198
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,660
Papa has it, too.

199
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,100
Do you wonder what your color is?

200
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,970
Well, that I won't tell you.
It's not ladylike to speak of such things.

201
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,230
You shouldn't even have asked.

202
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,470
(bird flying overhead)

203
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,340
You run like a boy.

204
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,080
Thank you.

205
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,390
I know why you denied my sister.

206
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,060
When I was younger...

207
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,800
...you used to hold my arm
when I walked.

208
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:47,130
Then suddenly, you stopped.

209
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:51,080
One day, I even tripped
in your presence, and nearly fell.

210
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:55,950
I was faking, of course,
but still, you did not hold me.

211
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,850
Sometimes we don't do
things we want to do

212
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,550
so that others won't know
we want to do them.

213
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,920
- What?
- (frog croaks)

214
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,230
(yelps and laughs)

215
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,950
What's this? Oh, berries.

216
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,350
What a splendid present.

217
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,410
(Lucius) Be cautious.

218
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,820
You are holding the bad color.

219
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,900
This color attracts Those We Don't
Speak Of. You must bury it.

220
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,570
You ought not to pick
that color berry any more.

221
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,300
He picked it from his pocket.

222
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,510
What's wrong?
Your breathing has changed.

223
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,350
(Lucius) I've never set eyes
on these before.

224
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,180
You did not pick that now.
Where did you find this?

225
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,620
"Today at Resting Rock,

226
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,230
Noah Percy handed lvy Walker berries
of the bad color."

227
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,530
"When asked where
he found these berries,

228
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,100
for they were not like
others I have seen,

229
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:30,470
he pointed to the drawing
upon Resting Rock."

230
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,410
"It is my belief that Noah Percy
has entered the woods,

231
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,880
and has done so on many occasions. "

232
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,390
"It is also my belief that,
because of his innocence,

233
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:46,050
those creatures who reside
in the woods did not harm him. "

234
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,560
"This strengthens my feeling
that they will let me pass

235
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,600
if they sense I am not a threat."

236
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,130
(Alice) We shall speak of the town,
just this once,

237
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,300
and we shall never speak of it again.

238
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,610
Your father left for the market
on a Tuesday,

239
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,710
at a quarter past nine in the morning.

240
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:21,080
He was found robbed and naked
in the filthy river, two days later.

241
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,290
Why'd you tell me this blackness?

242
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:33,670
So you will know the nature
of what you desire.

243
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,500
I do not desire it.
My intentions are true to my word.

244
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,050
I think of nothing
but the people of this village.

245
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:46,350
Forgive me.
I am but scared for my only son's life.

246
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,750
I am not the one with secrets.

247
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,180
What is your meaning?

248
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,260
There are secrets
in every corner of this village.

249
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:04,600
Do you not feel it? Do you not see it?

250
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,160
That is for my own well-being,

251
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,340
so the evil things from my past
are kept close and not forgotten.

252
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,010
Forgetting would be to let them
be born again in another form.

253
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,070
Then let us open it.

254
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,550
No!

255
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,380
Perhaps we should speak
with Edward Walker together.

256
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:24,820
- He may be able...
- He hides, too.

257
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:27,380
He hides his feelings for you.

258
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,130
Oh.

259
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,900
Sometimes we don't do things,

260
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:44,910
yet others know we want to do things,
so we don't do them.

261
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:52,280
What nonsense are you saying?

262
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,990
You needn't worry.
Nothing will happen to me.

263
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:07,330
You remind me of a colt sometimes.

264
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,940
What makes you think
he has feelings for me?

265
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,510
He never touches you.

266
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,380
(growling)

267
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,260
(rustling)

268
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,340
(growling)

269
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,140
There's no escape!

270
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,390
Oh, hello.

271
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,930
I was just playing a game with Noah.

272
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,090
The rascal must have gone
to hide in my house again.

273
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:55,220
(loudly) Houses are against the rules!

274
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,630
(whispering) He knows that.

275
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,610
Are you all right?

276
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:10,640
We're tending to the children tonight,
Kitty and l. I should be with her. Be well.

277
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,860
I heard my parents speaking of you.

278
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:24,230
I know of your request to go to the towns.

279
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,560
I think it is noble,
but I do not think it is right.

280
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:32,470
(Lucius) Are you not angry
you have no sight?

281
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,570
(whispers) I see the world, Lucius Hunt.

282
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,970
Just not as you see it.

283
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,750
What of Noah, then?

284
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:54,560
What if there are medicines for Noah
that could help him be still and to learn?

285
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:58,960
May we stop speaking of this?
It is putting knots in my stomach.

286
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,200
Kitty is to be married.

287
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:13,910
She's found love, again,
with Christop Crane.

288
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,540
You think it an odd choice, right?

289
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:22,490
You know, he won't sit back in his chair
for fear of setting wrinkles on his shirts.

290
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,250
But he does have
a gentlemanly way about him...

291
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:30,490
...and he does care for my sister deeply.

292
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,100
I think Kitty is blessed.

293
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,270
I am blessed as well.

294
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,540
My older sister is now spoken for.

295
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,840
I am now free to receive
interest from anyone...

296
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,540
...who might have interest.

297
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:57,520
(children laughing)

298
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:04,360
(Kitty) I'm going to get you. Oh!

299
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:07,830
I got you. I got you.
Can you fetch a blanket for me?

300
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,390
(Ivy) Have you seen Noah?

301
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,550
(loud thump)

302
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,720
Lucius?

303
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,870
Lucius?

304
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,770
(growling)

305
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,680
(whimpers)

306
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,650
(breathes heavily)

307
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,920
- (man) Hurry, to the cellar!
- (woman) Oh, good gracious!

308
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:42,050
(shouting and bell ringing)

309
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,270
- They're coming. They're coming.
- Close the door.

310
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,910
- Noah, close the door, OK?
- They're coming.

311
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,310
- Close the door.
- Coming!

312
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,750
Here we go.

313
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,790
- Noah, come on inside!
- (Noah) Come on inside!

314
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:17,220
(man) Everyone, inside!
Everyone, inside!

315
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,200
(bell ringing)

316
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,910
(grunting)

317
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:44,680
- (Noah) They're coming. Come on in.
- Let's close the door.

318
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,990
- (Ivy) Lucius is outside, walking.
- (Noah) They're coming.

319
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:52,690
He's inside safe somewhere!
Please, close the door!

320
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:57,400
He'll come back to make sure we're safe.

321
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:00,100
Ivy! Ivy, please.

322
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,420
(scratching)

323
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,120
(growling)

324
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,230
- (Kitty) Please.
- No.

325
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,970
Don't let them in.

326
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,340
(grunting)

327
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,150
(growling)

328
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,910
Come on in.

329
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,250
(thumping)

330
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,290
(rumbling)

331
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,700
(rustling)

332
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,510
(thumping)

333
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,910
(loud thump and hinges creaking)

334
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:07,630
(Walker) By the markings we find
this morning on our homes...

335
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,570
...I feel they were warning us.
They acted as if threatened.

336
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,010
(August) Creatures have never
attacked us without reason.

337
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,340
Does anyone here know of a reason...

338
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,540
... why these events may have occurred?

339
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,560
Who has written this note?

340
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,630
(clears throat)

341
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,070
"Please read so that all may hear."

342
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,770
"l have brought this burden upon us."

343
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,680
"On the day before last,
I crossed the forbidden line

344
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,090
- into Covington Woods..."
- (crowd gasps)

345
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,460
"...and was witnessed there
by Those We Don't Speak Of."

346
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:12,400
"l am deeply sorry."

347
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,230
"l have shamed myself and my family."

348
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:20,070
"l pray that my actions
will cause no further pains."

349
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,400
"With deepest sorrow, Lucius Hunt."

350
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,470
(crowd murmuring)

351
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,600
Is he in trouble?

352
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,670
(laughing)

353
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:10,550
Do not fret.

354
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:23,290
You are fearless in a way
that I shall never know.

355
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,910
(Walker) We are grateful...

356
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,380
...for the time we have been given.

357
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,780
(man) Yes. Yes, indeed.

358
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:46,660
(all start talking)

359
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,720
Cheers.

360
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,990
(distant singing)

361
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,270
I had an elder sister.

362
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,210
Mrs. Clack, you've been keeping secrets.

363
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:44,110
Oh, Kitty reminds me of her so.

364
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:49,110
(Ivy) What manner of person was she?

365
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,420
- Saucy.
- Oh.

366
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:55,980
And we fought endlessly.

367
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,230
May I ask her name?

368
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:10,500
Why did she not come
to Covington Woods?

369
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,840
My sister did not live
past her 23rd birthday.

370
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:23,380
A group of men took her life
in an alley by our home.

371
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,660
Please rise!

372
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,720
Come on.

373
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:09,360
She's not going to squeeze
my shirt like that, is she?

374
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,860
(muffled conversation)

375
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:26,010
Many blessings
on this most joyous of days.

376
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,640
It was a rare and lovely ceremony,
was it not?

377
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,710
Glorious.

378
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:37,660
I saw your hand move to your eyes
on more than one occasion.

379
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:40,360
That must have been dust of some matter.

380
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,030
(scream)

381
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,730
(scream)

382
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,110
(scream)

383
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,080
(boy) Mr. Walker!

384
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,820
- (boy) Mr. Walker!
- (boy #2) Mr. Walker!

385
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,720
(murmuring)

386
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,260
(man) Behind them.

387
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:18,690
(man #2) How did she deal
with this brightness?

388
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,790
(woman) Help us out.

389
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,770
(man #3) Where are
the rest of them?

390
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:30,370
Speak up.

391
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,910
- They're in the village.
- What?

392
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,140
They left more warnings.

393
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:38,610
They wish us to leave.

394
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,020
That cannot be.

395
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,880
One saw us.

396
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,150
It ran off into the darkness.

397
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,690
You are certain?

398
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,360
Can you boys stay close to lvy here?

399
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,070
She'll tell you some funny stories
and have you laughing soon.

400
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,810
We will go together.

401
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,710
(children whimpering)

402
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:12,630
(Alice) Livestock has been taken
and skinned.

403
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:16,080
The hides and feathers are missing.

404
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:21,210
There are marks on the door
where it was opened.

405
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:27,150
The marks are high.

406
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:30,750
Coyotes cannot reach that height.

407
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,630
(gasps)

408
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:36,750
(Alice) The elders are going to have
an inquiry tomorrow.

409
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:41,490
Each member of the village is to be
questioned in the meeting hall.

410
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:43,930
(Lucius) To see how
the border was breached?

411
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,990
(Alice) Yes.

412
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,970
It is cold outside.

413
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,340
You ought to go in.

414
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:01,680
Why are you on this porch?

415
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:03,850
It is not safe.

416
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,190
There are other porches.

417
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:12,460
Do you find me too much of a tomboy?

418
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:16,530
I do long to do boy things...

419
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,670
...Iike that game
the boys play at the stump.

420
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:23,540
They put their backs to the woods,

421
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:27,480
and see how long they can wait
before getting scared.

422
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:32,420
That's so exciting.

423
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:36,290
I understand you hold the record.

424
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:41,590
It will never be broken, they say.

425
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:45,190
It's just children's games.

426
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:49,500
How is it you are brave when all
the rest of us shake in our boots?

427
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:57,540
I do not worry about what will happen,
only what needs to be done.

428
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:02,800
How did you know I was here?

429
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,210
I saw you out the window.

430
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:09,090
No...

431
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:12,090
...I won't tell you your color.

432
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,750
Stop asking.

433
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:23,060
When we are married,
will you dance with me?

434
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:26,590
I find dancing very agreeable.

435
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,300
Why can you not say what is in your head?

436
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:40,680
Why can you not stop saying
what is in yours?

437
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:47,290
Why must you lead, when I want to lead?

438
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:51,020
If I want to dance, I will ask you to dance.

439
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:55,560
If I want to speak,
I will open my mouth and speak.

440
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:59,970
Everyone is forever
plaguing me to speak further.

441
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,800
Why? What good is it to tell you

442
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,740
you are in my every thought
from the time I wake?

443
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:10,370
What good can come from my saying
l-I sometimes cannot think clearly,

444
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:13,350
or do my work properly?

445
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:18,790
What gain can rise from my telling you
the only time I feel fear as others do...

446
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:23,150
...is when I think of you in harm?

447
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,690
That is why I am on this porch, lvy Walker.

448
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:34,060
I fear for your safety before all others.

449
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:40,600
And, yes...

450
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,410
...I will dance with you
on our wedding night.

451
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,900
(woman) I had been to the storage shed
twice to fetch food

452
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:09,100
prior to the wedding ceremony.

453
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:12,400
(Alice) And the livestock
was untouched at that time?

454
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,880
(woman) Yes, Mrs. Hunt.
All was as it should be.

455
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,180
Thank you, Beatrice.

456
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:29,550
I beg your pardon.

457
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:33,620
Is it true... about Lucius and lvy?

458
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,830
There are whispers all over the village.

459
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:45,940
We were informed early this morning
of their intentions.

460
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:50,850
It is amazing to witness
which two people love chooses to unite.

461
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,480
It follows no rules.

462
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:56,050
Kitty...

463
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,450
I wanted to speak with you first.

464
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,590
I would not want you to feel pain,
in any fashion.

465
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:07,790
You are my cherished one.

466
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:12,200
If you were to feel badly
about Lucius, I would not have it.

467
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:16,470
One love to sacrifice
another love is not right.

468
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:25,970
There is nothing you could do
that would sacrifice my love for you.

469
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,580
You are my cherished one as well.

470
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,230
God bless you and your life together.

471
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:53,300
(knock on door)

472
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:04,540
What's happened?

473
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,970
Is this about lvy and myself?

474
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:30,540
I know you are very fond of her.

475
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,110
And I know she is fond of you.

476
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:42,090
There are different types of love.

477
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,480
Oh.

478
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,680
Oh, God.

479
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:21,260
(moaning)

480
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:31,770
Oh, lvy...

481
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:37,970
(groans)

482
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:57,190
- (knocking)
- Noah?

483
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:04,670
You'll be late for the meeting hall. Would
you like your father to walk you there?

484
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,570
(creaking)

485
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:09,280
Noah?

486
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,630
Oh...

487
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:36,610
The bad... The bad color.

488
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:40,970
Oh...

489
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:47,410
The bad color, the bad color...

490
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:53,720
(music plays and dialogue muted)

491
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:58,050
Mama!

492
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:00,650
(door opens)

493
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:07,030
- I beg your pardon.
- What is it?

494
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:09,700
There's been an accident.

495
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:27,220
Noah Percy was found with quarts
of blood upon his clothes and hands.

496
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:30,950
The blood was not his own,
and he will not speak as to whose it is.

497
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:34,160
God in heaven.

498
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:35,320
Ivy!

499
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:39,800
(man) Is there anyone injured in here?

500
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:42,530
(Alice) Has anyone
been hurt in this home?

501
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,770
Is anyone in here?

502
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,780
(Walker) Is anyone hurt in this house?

503
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,150
(muttering)

504
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:01,580
22, 23, 24...

505
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:15,100
31, 32, 33...

506
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:36,420
Lucius?

507
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:40,820
Lucius Hunt!

508
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:45,400
You answer me right this moment!

509
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:03,380
(distant voices)

510
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:12,160
(Walker) Is anyone hurt in this house?

511
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:16,570
They're fine.

512
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:18,630
Mr. Walker!

513
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:24,260
(Walker) Joseph!

514
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:33,610
Papa... I cannot see his color.

515
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,380
Ivy.

516
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,450
- Come away. Come away.
- (screams)

517
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:45,020
Come away. Here, take her.

518
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,390
Take her.

519
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:50,400
(screams) No!

520
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:56,500
(Mrs. Clack) He has suffered a great deal.

521
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:01,130
He may pass at any time.

522
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:09,350
Please give him all your prayers
and good thoughts.

523
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,650
He will hear them.

524
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:39,310
(door unlocking)

525
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,000
(whimpering)

526
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:04,060
(man) Turn!

527
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:09,980
(groans)

528
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:13,580
(crying)

529
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,650
(yelling and banging)

530
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,890
(Ivy) I am in love.

531
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:33,560
(Walker) I know.

532
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:37,200
He is in love with me.

533
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:40,700
I know.

534
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,870
If he dies...

535
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:48,780
...all that is life to me will die with him.

536
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:54,920
I ask permission...

537
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:59,460
...to travel through Covington Woods...

538
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:05,660
...and go to the towns...

539
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:10,070
...to retrieve medicines...

540
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:15,140
...that may save...

541
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:19,170
...Lucius Hunt.

542
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,930
You are my father.

543
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,360
I will listen to you in all things.

544
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:40,760
I will trust your decision.

545
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:51,670
(man) I've done what I can to close
the wounds. There's an infection.

546
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:54,410
What can be done to mend him?

547
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,380
We can only pray.

548
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:03,490
If there were no limitations,
what could be done?

549
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:06,960
Hmm?

550
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:09,360
What are you asking me?

551
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:18,410
Is there anything at all
that can be done to mend the boy?

552
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,270
Please, Victor. Would you be so kind
as to answer my question?

553
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:39,790
(Victor) If the infection is contained,
he may still survive.

554
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:45,260
I must speak up.

555
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:49,570
You have a restless spirit.

556
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:52,170
I know the thing that is in your head.

557
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:57,640
You're thinking of going to the towns.

558
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:00,950
Tell me I'm wrong.

559
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:08,410
You have made an oath, Edward,
as all have, never to go back.

560
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:12,490
It is a painful bargain,
but no good can come without sacrifice.

561
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,930
These are your words I'm saying.
You cannot break the oath.

562
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,490
- It is sacred.
- It is a crime,

563
01:01:18,570 --> 01:01:21,230
what has happened to Lucius.

564
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:25,240
You have taken the oath.

565
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:29,210
You and the rest of the elders...
Are you listening to me?

566
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,270
You...

567
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,280
...have taken the oath.

568
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:06,180
The moment I heard my daughter's
vision had finally failed her,

569
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:10,190
and that she would forever be blind,
I was sitting in that very chair.

570
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,650
I was so ashamed.

571
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:23,260
What do you know about your grandfather?

572
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:28,630
He was the wealthiest man in the towns?

573
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:31,870
That he was. He had a gift for that.

574
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:37,940
If he was given one dollar, in less than a
fortnight, he would have turned it into five.

575
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:42,150
You do not know of money.
It is not part of our life here.

576
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:44,950
Money can be a wicked thing.

577
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:49,150
It can turn men's hearts black -
good men's hearts.

578
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:52,990
My father could not see this.
For all his gifts,

579
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:58,560
he was a poor judge of a man's character.
Your grandfather was a good man, lvy.

580
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,130
He had a laugh that could
be heard three houses away.

581
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:04,270
He used to hold my hand as I hold yours.

582
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:07,370
He taught me strength
and showed me love,

583
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:13,510
and told me to lead
when others would only follow.

584
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:21,080
Your grandfather, James Walker,
died in his sleep.

585
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:24,890
A man put a gun to his head
and shot him while he dreamed.

586
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:31,030
I tell you this so you will understand
some of the reasons for my actions,

587
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:32,830
and...

588
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:37,170
...and the actions of others.

589
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:44,510
You are a strong one, lvy.
You lead when others would follow.

590
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:48,540
You see light
when there is only darkness.

591
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:55,620
I trust you.

592
01:03:57,490 --> 01:04:01,360
I trust you among all others.

593
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:07,290
Thank you, Father.

594
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:10,000
Ivy, do you know where you are?

595
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:14,200
At the old shed that is not to be used.

596
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,870
Yeah.

597
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:24,220
- lvy.
- Yes, Father?

598
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,010
Do your very best not to scream.

599
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:33,220
(door unlocking)

600
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:35,290
(door opening)

601
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:37,800
What?

602
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:13,970
I am leaving to fetch you medicines.

603
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:18,470
I had a difficult time getting away.

604
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,530
What is it?

605
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,570
(sighs)

606
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:31,310
Ivy...

607
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:33,380
...has asked...

608
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:37,390
...to go to the towns...

609
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:40,400
...for medicines.

610
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:45,360
(sniffing)

611
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:51,110
(footsteps approaching)

612
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:22,360
Christop.

613
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:28,800
Christop...

614
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:31,270
you needn't be scared.

615
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:34,440
We have the magic rocks.

616
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:36,540
They will keep us safe.

617
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:41,710
Why have we not heard
of these rocks before?

618
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:45,950
Christop, please.
Do not leave us.

619
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:48,180
There is nothing to fear.

620
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,060
Then why do you wear the cloak
of the safe color?

621
01:07:53,130 --> 01:07:55,890
We will light torches.

622
01:07:55,970 --> 01:07:58,760
It will be safe.

623
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,830
It is forbidden.

624
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,430
(Finton) Christop.

625
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:53,920
Ivy...

626
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:56,750
there's something in these woods.

627
01:08:58,130 --> 01:09:00,560
It turns my stomach to rot.

628
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:13,510
You will be safe. They will not harm you,
because you cannot see.

629
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:16,570
They will take pity on you,
the way they took pity on Noah

630
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:19,310
when... when he ventured in the woods.

631
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:25,090
They will kill me, lvy.

632
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,120
I cannot stay.

633
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:38,330
You're better in these woods
than most boys. Anyone would say so.

634
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,230
It is my burden, Finton.

635
01:09:43,170 --> 01:09:45,700
- You may go.
- Come with me.

636
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:16,100
(Walker) Do your very best not to scream.

637
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:18,730
(door opens)

638
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:33,250
(Ivy) There's an odd smell.

639
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:40,490
(Walker) It is ahead of you.

640
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:44,760
(Ivy) What is it?

641
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,400
(Walker) I cannot explain in words.

642
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:51,500
It is just a few steps.

643
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:03,180
(screams)

644
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:08,450
- Those We Don't Speak Of!
- Do not be frightened.

645
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:12,420
It is only farce.

646
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:18,600
Do not be frightened.

647
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:34,880
There did exist rumors
of creatures in these woods.

648
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:38,940
It is in one of the history books
I used to teach in the towns.

649
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:43,160
The screams from the woods?

650
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,160
We created those sounds.

651
01:11:48,230 --> 01:11:50,760
The Ceremony of Meat?

652
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:55,270
We remove it ourselves.
An elder is always assigned.

653
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:58,670
The drills -
they are farce, too?

654
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:02,080
We did not want anyone
to go to the towns, lvy.

655
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:09,150
What about the animals -
the skinned ones?

656
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:14,350
- Are the elders responsible for that, too?
- I believe one of the elders is responsible.

657
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:16,690
It will not happen again.

658
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:20,660
There is no one in this village
who has not lost someone irreplaceable,

659
01:12:20,730 --> 01:12:27,400
who has not felt loss so deeply that they
questioned the very merit of living at all.

660
01:12:27,470 --> 01:12:29,960
It is a darkness I wished...

661
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:33,310
...you would never know.

662
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:40,950
Forgive us our silly lies, lvy.
They were not meant to harm.

663
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:54,120
I am... sad for you, Papa.

664
01:12:56,230 --> 01:12:59,070
For all the elders.

665
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:13,250
On this paper has been written
a tool of medicine.

666
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,340
It is common in the towns.

667
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:19,050
You will go... with two escorts.

668
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,250
Follow the sounds of the stream.

669
01:13:22,330 --> 01:13:25,690
A half day's journey
will bring you to a hidden road.

670
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,960
At this hidden road, the two escorts
will wait as you continue.

671
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:34,200
You alone will follow the road...

672
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:39,000
...and leave Covington Woods.

673
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:43,940
You are to tell no one
in the towns where we are...

674
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:46,410
...and return with haste.

675
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,490
I cannot come with you.

676
01:13:55,930 --> 01:13:59,020
You gave your heart to this boy.

677
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:03,190
He is in need.

678
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:08,230
Are you ready to take this burden,

679
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:13,300
which, by right,
is yours and yours alone?

680
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:26,020
I am making fresh cloths for Lucius.
He needs them.

681
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:28,350
Alice, I've sent for help.

682
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:35,720
I've sent lvy to the towns.

683
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,390
You cannot.

684
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:45,200
It is all that I can give you.

685
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,810
It is all that I can give you.

686
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,150
I accept.

687
01:15:22,410 --> 01:15:28,040
- What have you done?
- He is the victim of a crime.

688
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:31,780
We have agreed never to go back. Never.

689
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:34,350
What was the purpose of our leaving?

690
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:39,560
Let us not forget it was out of hope
of something good and right.

691
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:41,860
You should not have made
decisions without us.

692
01:15:41,930 --> 01:15:44,960
- You have gone too far.
- I'm guilty, Robert!

693
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:50,700
I made a decision of the heart.
I cannot look into another's eyes

694
01:15:50,770 --> 01:15:56,180
and see the same look
I see in August's without justification!

695
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:59,370
It is too painful. I cannot bear it!

696
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:02,540
You have jeopardized
everything we've made.

697
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:10,090
Who do you think
will continue this place, this life?

698
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:15,120
Do you plan to live forever?

699
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,100
It is in them that our future lies.

700
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:23,870
It is in lvy and Lucius that
this... this way of life will continue.

701
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:27,940
Yes, I have risked! I hope I am always able

702
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:31,710
to risk everything
for the just and right cause.

703
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:40,020
If we did not make this decision, we could
never again call ourselves innocent.

704
01:16:40,090 --> 01:16:45,430
And that, in the end, is what we
have protected here - innocence!

705
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,260
That, I'm not ready to give up.

706
01:16:55,940 --> 01:16:58,000
Let her go.

707
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,810
If it ends, it ends.

708
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:10,920
We can move towards hope.
It's what's beautiful about this place.

709
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:14,920
We must not run from heartache.

710
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:17,950
You know, my brother
was slain in the towns.

711
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:20,020
The rest of my family died here.

712
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:23,590
Heartache is a part of life.
We know that now.

713
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:26,530
Ivy's running toward hope.
Let her run.

714
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:31,730
If this place is worthy,
she'll be successful in her quest.

715
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,110
How could you have sent her?

716
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:39,340
She's blind.

717
01:17:40,450 --> 01:17:44,250
She's more capable
than most in this village...

718
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:49,050
...and she is led by love.

719
01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:52,580
The world moves for love.

720
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:57,600
It kneels before it in awe.

721
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:13,180
# All the world to see

722
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:17,450
# Time to look about and know

723
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:21,650
# How the shadows come and go

724
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:25,890
# How the breeze stirs the trees

725
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:30,090
# How the blossoms grow

726
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:34,230
# Sleep, baby, sleep

727
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:38,140
# Sleep, gently sleep

728
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:08,430
(screams)

729
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:28,480
(whimpering)

730
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:54,940
(grunting)

731
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:22,670
(gasping)

732
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:28,740
(gasping)

733
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:58,140
(Walker) There did exist rumors
of creatures in these woods.

734
01:20:58,210 --> 01:21:00,740
It is in one of the history books
I used to teach in the towns.

735
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:02,650
(grunts)

736
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,150
(crying)

737
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:30,880
(gasps)

738
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,150
(rustling)

739
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:11,580
(rustling)

740
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,630
(whimpering)

741
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:33,240
(rustling)

742
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:35,310
(crying)

743
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:12,380
(growl)

744
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:18,550
(growl)

745
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:29,000
It is not real.

746
01:23:29,330 --> 01:23:31,430
It is not real.

747
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:34,500
(whimpering)

748
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:55,450
(growls)

749
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,310
(roars)

750
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,830
(screaming)

751
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:40,330
(roaring)

752
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,270
(roars)

753
01:24:55,350 --> 01:24:57,720
(screaming)

754
01:25:01,790 --> 01:25:03,620
(gasping)

755
01:25:58,150 --> 01:26:00,240
(roaring)

756
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:12,780
(woman) Noah?

757
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:18,860
- Oh, my God. What is this?
- What is this?

758
01:26:18,930 --> 01:26:20,990
(woman) Where is he?

759
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:28,110
(Robert) He found one of the suits
we kept under the floorboards.

760
01:26:28,180 --> 01:26:30,270
(woman sobbing) Oh, no.

761
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:32,580
Oh, God.

762
01:26:32,650 --> 01:26:34,840
The animals.

763
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,350
(moaning)

764
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:49,730
(whimpering)

765
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:02,010
(whimpering)

766
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:47,220
(gasps)

767
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:04,300
(Walker) His will to live is very strong.

768
01:28:45,810 --> 01:28:50,410
(Walker) A half day's journey
will bring you to a hidden road.

769
01:28:50,490 --> 01:28:54,790
You alone will follow the road...

770
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:58,750
...and leave Covington Woods.

771
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:04,490
You are to tell no one
in the towns where we are...

772
01:29:05,370 --> 01:29:07,730
...and return with haste.

773
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:53,710
(yelps)

774
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,830
(grunting)

775
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:18,830
(Mrs. Clack) My sister did not live
past her 23rd birthday.

776
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:22,600
A group of men raped and killed her.

777
01:31:22,670 --> 01:31:25,900
They stuffed her in a Dumpster...

778
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:30,510
three blocks from our apartment.

779
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:34,520
(August) My brother worked
in an emergency room downtown.

780
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:38,920
A drug addict came in
with a wound to his ribs.

781
01:31:38,990 --> 01:31:41,680
My brother tried to dress the wound.

782
01:31:42,690 --> 01:31:45,560
He pulled a gun from his jacket...

783
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:49,590
... then he shot my brother
through his left eye.

784
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:51,860
(Alice) My husband, Michael,

785
01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:56,300
Ieft for the supermarket
at a quarter past nine in the morning.

786
01:31:56,370 --> 01:32:01,710
He was found
with no money and no clothes

787
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:04,370
in the East River, three days later.

788
01:32:04,450 --> 01:32:09,110
(Walker) My father was shot
by a business partner,

789
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:13,050
who then hanged himself
in my father's closet.

790
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,820
They had argued over money.

791
01:32:15,890 --> 01:32:17,920
I am a professor.

792
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:23,560
I teach American History
at the University of Pennsylvania.

793
01:32:23,630 --> 01:32:26,000
I have an idea...

794
01:32:26,970 --> 01:32:29,800
... that I would like to talk to you about.

795
01:32:30,810 --> 01:32:31,900
(siren)

796
01:32:31,970 --> 01:32:35,430
Mile 27 - there's a girl.
I'm gonna check it out.

797
01:32:35,510 --> 01:32:37,840
(man on radio) Be careful.

798
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:42,440
(siren)

799
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:01,930
You're not allowed to go in there.

800
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,200
Please return to your vehicle.

801
01:33:04,270 --> 01:33:06,760
(Ivy) What was that noise?

802
01:33:09,710 --> 01:33:13,650
What are you doing out here?
How... how'd you get here?

803
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:16,050
Are you from the towns?

804
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:19,110
Uh...

805
01:33:19,190 --> 01:33:21,520
Where are you from?

806
01:33:24,490 --> 01:33:27,160
The woods.

807
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:32,960
You came from the woods?

808
01:33:35,070 --> 01:33:37,440
In there?

809
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:41,100
Will you help me?

810
01:33:41,740 --> 01:33:45,540
I need to find a doctor of medicine.

811
01:33:45,610 --> 01:33:47,880
I must find these things.
We must make haste.

812
01:33:47,950 --> 01:33:50,320
Listen, ma'am.

813
01:33:51,450 --> 01:33:53,790
I'm just supposed to...

814
01:34:12,210 --> 01:34:14,730
Is someone hurt?

815
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:18,810
Please, sir. We must make haste.

816
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:27,520
- Well, you... you live in there?
- I do, sir.

817
01:34:36,630 --> 01:34:38,860
(man on radio) Breaker.

818
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,630
- What is your name?
- Kevin.

819
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:46,230
Kevin.

820
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:49,670
You have kindness in your voice.

821
01:34:51,410 --> 01:34:53,970
I did not expect that.

822
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:03,260
We have guard shacks every ten miles
around the perimeter of the preserve.

823
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:08,850
We keep medical supplies in there
in case of animal bites or related injuries.

824
01:35:08,930 --> 01:35:12,200
You can find the things
written on the paper?

825
01:35:13,570 --> 01:35:15,730
Uh...

826
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:18,800
- You have to wait here.
- Please, sir.

827
01:35:18,870 --> 01:35:21,240
Please... take this as payment.

828
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:30,750
Wait, y-you're not...

829
01:35:30,820 --> 01:35:33,580
You're not tricking me, are you?

830
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:36,650
I do not understand.

831
01:35:38,830 --> 01:35:41,460
What's your name?

832
01:35:41,530 --> 01:35:43,520
Ivy.

833
01:35:45,430 --> 01:35:48,200
Ivy Elizabeth Walker.

834
01:35:50,810 --> 01:35:52,400
(man on radio)
There's an overturned tractor-trailer

835
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:54,910
causing a one-hour delay
at the Lincoln Tunnel.

836
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:57,170
The body of seven-year-old
Katrina Nelson was found today.

837
01:35:57,250 --> 01:35:59,300
She'd been missing for three days.

838
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:03,650
Another 1 4 soldiers died in combat
when a bomb exploded in their convoy.

839
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:05,120
It's 35 degrees outside.

840
01:36:05,190 --> 01:36:07,590
(radio off)

841
01:36:07,660 --> 01:36:10,450
What's with the girl?
I tried calling you back on the walkie.

842
01:36:10,530 --> 01:36:13,120
- You didn't answer.
- Oh, it was just some teenagers.

843
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:15,960
They were lost.

844
01:36:16,030 --> 01:36:20,370
Can I give you some advice?
Don't get into conversations.

845
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:24,570
You start talkin', you start gettin' into
how some estate is payin' all of us,

846
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:28,080
and no one's allowed to go in there
and disturb the animal sanctuary.

847
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:30,630
People's interest gets piqued.

848
01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:34,550
It's a really easy gig, Kevin.
Maintain and protect the border.

849
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:38,610
That's it. A few years ago,

850
01:36:38,690 --> 01:36:41,660
it got out in the papers that some
government guys had been paid off

851
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:45,490
to keep plane routes
from flying over this place.

852
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,890
That was a very
stressful time for me.

853
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:50,120
Don't cause me any troubles.

854
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:52,760
Do not get into conversations.

855
01:37:44,190 --> 01:37:47,120
Hey, Jay,
where's the maintenance ladder?

856
01:37:49,490 --> 01:37:51,820
I n-need to fix a sign.

857
01:37:53,330 --> 01:37:55,320
It's in the back.

858
01:38:39,710 --> 01:38:41,540
(beeping)

859
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:07,200
Ivy has returned
with medicines from the towns.

860
01:39:07,270 --> 01:39:10,260
She was attacked
by a creature and killed it.

861
01:39:12,940 --> 01:39:14,770
(sobbing)

862
01:39:22,050 --> 01:39:23,380
Noah.

863
01:39:23,450 --> 01:39:25,940
Oh, God.

864
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:28,350
We will find him.

865
01:39:31,190 --> 01:39:33,350
We will give him...

866
01:39:35,230 --> 01:39:37,220
...a proper burial.

867
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:42,470
We will tell the others...

868
01:39:45,670 --> 01:39:48,400
...he was killed by the creatures.

869
01:39:52,750 --> 01:39:55,610
Your son has made our stories real.

870
01:39:59,850 --> 01:40:03,420
Noah has given us a chance
to continue this place...

871
01:40:07,530 --> 01:40:10,090
...if that is something...

872
01:40:13,170 --> 01:40:15,500
...we still wish for.

873
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:30,000
I'm back, Lucius.

874
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:40,920
