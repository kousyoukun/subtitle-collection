1
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:33,528
Robbed. Cleaned out.

2
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:38,366
$9,967, precisely as I told you
over the telephone.

3
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,828
And that girl did it,
Marion Holland.

4
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:44,789
That's the girl,
Marion Holland!

5
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:49,001
Can you describe her,
Mr. Strutt?
Certainly I can describe her.

6
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:53,047
Five feet five, 110 pounds,

7
00:02:54,216 --> 00:03:00,888
size eight dress,
blue eyes, black wavy hair,

8
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,934
even features, good teeth...

9
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,478
Well, what's so damn funny?

10
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:10,022
There's been a grand larceny
committed on these premises!

11
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:14,944
Yes, sir. You were saying,
black hair, wavy,

12
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,321
even features, good teeth.
Yeah. Yes.

13
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:20,199
And she was in your
employ four months?
Mmm.

14
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,369
What were her references, sir?

15
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,955
Well, as a matter of fact...

16
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,209
Yes, she had references,
I'm sure.

17
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:32,837
Oh, Mr. Strutt,
don't you remember?

18
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,548
She didn't have any
references at all.

19
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,011
Well, she worked
the copying and
adding machines.

20
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,138
No confidential duties.

21
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:47,476
Mr. Rutland. I didn't
know you were in town.

22
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,355
Just had a robbery.
Almost $10,000.

23
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,567
So I gathered.
By a pretty girl
with no references.

24
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,485
You remember her.
I pointed her out

25
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,529
to you the last
time you were here.

26
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:02,909
You said something about
how I was improving
the looks of the place.

27
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,912
Oh, that one.
The brunette with the legs.

28
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,041
Excuse me, men.
Mr. Rutland's a client.

29
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,170
I don't think you've got
time to discuss business
today, Mr. Strutt.

30
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:17,340
Not with your crime
wave on your hands.
Oh, no, no.

31
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,134
Always time for
Rutland business.
You know that.

32
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,678
How are things
in Philadelphia?

33
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:27,224
The little witch!
I'll have her put
away for 20 years!

34
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,727
I knew she was
too good to be true.

35
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,648
Always so eager
to work overtime,
never made a mistake.

36
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,276
Always pulling her skirt down
over her knees

37
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,821
as though they were
a national treasure.

38
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:44,659
She seemed so nice,
so efficient, so...

39
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,243
Resourceful?

40
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,694
Wilmington, Baltimore, Washington.

41
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,406
Richmond,
Petersburg, Rocky Mount.

42
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:51,368
Wilson,
Fayetteville, Florence.

43
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:54,872
Charleston,
Savannah, Jacksonville,

44
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:59,418
Miami,
Tampa, Saint Petersburg.

45
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:06,467
Charleston, Pittsburgh, Camden
leaving on track number 12.

46
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:36,914
Hello, Mrs. Maitland.
Oh, so nice to have
you back, Miss Edgar.

47
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:40,334
We put you in your same room.
Thank you, Mrs. Maitland.

48
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,336
Can someone drive me over
to Garrod's right away?

49
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,047
Of course.
Any time you're ready.

50
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,591
As soon as I change.

51
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,443
How do, Miss Edgar?
Good to have you back.

52
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,154
Hello, Mr. Garrod.

53
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,947
Oh, there's my darling.

54
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,576
That big old spoiled baby of yours
knew something was up.

55
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,536
Tried to bite me twice
already this morning.

56
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,747
Oh, Forio, if you want
to bite somebody, bite me.

57
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,551
Thanks.

58
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,954
Mother, Mother, I am ill.

59
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,082
Send for the doctor
over the hill.

60
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,919
Call for the doctor.
Call for the nurse.

61
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:08,005
Call for the lady
with the alligator purse.

62
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,091
"Mumps," said the doctor.
"Measles," said the nurse.

63
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,844
"Nothing," said the lady
with the alligator purse.

64
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,639
How many years will I live?
Thank you.

65
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:21,685
One, two, three,
four, five, six,

66
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,314
seven, eight, nine, 10, 11...
Oh, it's you. Where's my mother?

67
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,150
She's making
a pecan pie for me!

68
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,320
That figures.

69
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,490
Mother, Mother, I am ill.

70
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,408
Send for the doctor...

71
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,912
Who is it, Jessie?

72
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,288
Hello, Mama.

73
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:45,417
Well, I just swan. Marnie!
If you're not the very limit.

74
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,795
I can't take in the way
you jump around

75
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,214
all over the place
like you do.

76
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:54,051
Boston, Massachusetts.
Elizabeth, New Jersey.

77
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,264
I brought you
some chrysanthemums.

78
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,432
Those gladiolus
are brand fresh.

79
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,978
Miss Cotton brought them
to me only last night.

80
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:07,398
I never could stand gladiolus.
I'll get rid of these.

81
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:11,318
For land's sake... Marnie,
now watch the dripping.

82
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:14,113
Here, Jessica,
why don't you take these
home to your mother?

83
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,657
She don't get home
from work till 6:00.

84
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,159
I'm supposed to
stay here till 6:00.

85
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,454
Well, take them out
to the kitchen then.
Just get rid of them.

86
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,248
Take them on out to
the kitchen, Jessie, honey,

87
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,125
before they drip all over.

88
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:29,586
We could stand gladiolus!

89
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,174
I send you
plenty of money, Mama.

90
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,843
You don't have to
be a babysitter.

91
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:39,638
Well, whoever said I did
have to? It's my pleasure.

92
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:43,309
That smart little old Jessie.

93
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:46,478
Marnie, if you could
just hear some of
the things that she says.

94
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,731
Oh, but I do.

95
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,108
Seems to me
I get a report in
exhaustive detail

96
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,486
on all the bright sayings
of old Jessie Cotton.

97
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:58,032
What's more,
every time I come home,
she's roosting here.

98
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,412
I see that you've lighted up
your hair, Marnie.

99
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:08,042
A little.
Why? Don't you like it?
No.

100
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:13,464
Too blonde hair always looks like a
woman's trying to attract the men.

101
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,884
Men and a good name
don't go together.

102
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,472
I brought you something, Mama.

103
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,935
Now what have you thrown
good money away on?

104
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,645
Oh, Marnie.

105
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,566
You shouldn't
spend all your money
on me like you do.

106
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,361
But that's what
money's for, to spend.

107
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,989
Like the Bible says,
"Money answereth all things."

108
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:43,035
We don't talk
smart about the Bible
in this house, missy!

109
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:53,170
Well, I just swan!
How do I wear it?

110
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,298
Like this.
Real high up under the chin.

111
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,510
Oh, it's smart.
It's very, very smart.

112
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:03,138
Going around buying fur pieces
like they's nothing.

113
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,641
Mr. Pemberton gave
me another raise.

114
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:10,229
I told Miss Cotton
my daughter is private
secretary to a millionaire.

115
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:14,900
He's as generous with her
as if she was his
very own daughter.

116
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,362
Miss Bernice, don't you want
to get my hair brushed up

117
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,905
before my mommy gets home?

118
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:23,534
Well, I sure do, honey.
You run up and get the brush.

119
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,663
Oh, that kid and her hair.

120
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,542
Puts me in mind of yours
when you was little.

121
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,085
The color.

122
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,047
This side of the street
don't get the afternoon sun.

123
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,925
My hip and my leg
ache me something awful.

124
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,476
I got the hairbrush!

125
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,314
Uh, Marnie, mind my leg.

126
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,503
I never had time to
take care of Marnie's hair

127
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,131
when she was
a little kid like you.

128
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,384
How come?
Oh, child!

129
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:26,138
Well, after I had
my bad accident,

130
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:30,058
well,
first I was sick so long,
and then I had to work.

131
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,145
Didn't you all
have a daddy either?

132
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:37,191
No, we didn't.
We surely did not!

133
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:41,653
There. As pretty as
brushing can make you.

134
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:46,742
Oh, sugarpop, it's 6:05.
You better scat on home.

135
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:50,037
And you be sure to take
your mama those glads.

136
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,585
How about my pie?
How about my pecan pie?

137
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,755
I'll get it done tonight
and bring it over to you.

138
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,174
Now, Jessie, you mind
you go straight home.

139
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:06,595
Okay. Bye, Miss Bernice.
See you later, Miss Bernice.

140
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,771
Do you really
like the scarf, Mama?
It's real mink.

141
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,567
Oh, there.
You look just like
an old man's darling.

142
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:24,196
No man ever give
me anything so good.

143
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,365
We don't need men, Mama.

144
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:30,369
We can do very
well for ourselves.
Just you and me.

145
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,455
A decent woman
don't have need for any man.

146
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:39,461
Look at you, Marnie.
I told Miss Cotton,
look at my girl Marnie.

147
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:43,215
She's too smart
to go getting herself
mixed up with men,

148
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,800
none of them.

149
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:51,932
Well, let's go on
back to the kitchen.
I've got to see to that pie.

150
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,079
Uh, Marnie,
I've been thinking seriously

151
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:18,000
about asking Miss
Cotton and Jessie
to move in here with me.

152
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:21,086
Miss Cotton is
a real nice woman.

153
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:26,758
She's decent.
A hard-working woman
with a little girl to raise.

154
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,761
Come on, Mama,
why don't you just
say what you mean?

155
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:33,181
What you want is for Jessie
to come live with you.

156
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:40,105
Marnie, you oughtn't
let yourself act jealous
of a little old kid like that.

157
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:44,985
She don't bother me none.
And we could always
use extra money.

158
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,780
The Cottons are
mighty decent people.

159
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,537
Why don't you love me, Mama?

160
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,458
I've always
wondered why you don't.

161
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,380
Oh, you never give me one part
of the love you give Jessie.

162
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,135
Mama.

163
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,391
Why do you always
move away from me?
Why? What's wrong with me?

164
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,061
Nothing!
Nothing's wrong with you.

165
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,147
No. You don't think that.

166
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,815
You've always thought
there was something

167
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,567
wrong with me,
haven't you? Always!

168
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,319
I never.

169
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:33,742
My God! When I think
of the things I've done
to try to make you love me.

170
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,286
The things I've done!

171
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:43,877
What are you
thinking now, Mama?
About the things I've done?

172
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:49,091
What do you think they are?
Things that aren't decent,
is that it?

173
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,009
Why, you think I'm
Mr. Pemberton's girl.

174
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,928
Is that why you don't
want me to touch you?

175
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:56,556
Is that how you
think I get the money
to set you up?

176
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,900
I'm... I'm sorry, Mama.

177
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,654
I don't know what got
into me talking like that.

178
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,156
I know you've
never really thought
anything bad about me.

179
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,783
No, I never.

180
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:20,497
Well, I'm sorry. I really am.
I'll pick up the pecans.

181
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:25,377
No, uh, you go upstairs
and lay down.
You're all wore out.

182
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,088
I'll ask Jessie to come over
and pick up the nuts.

183
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,631
All right.

184
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:36,972
After all, it is Jessie's
pie, isn't it?

185
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,536
No, I don't want to. Mama, no!

186
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,874
Marnie, wake up. Marnie?

187
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,419
Don't make me move, Mama.
It's too cold.

188
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,172
Wake up, Marnie.
You're still dreaming.

189
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:14,009
Get washed up.
Supper's ready.
Oh.

190
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:20,766
I was having that
old dream again.
First the tapping and then...

191
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,018
I said, supper's ready.

192
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,730
It's always when
you come to the door.

193
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:30,275
That's when the cold starts.

194
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,038
Miss Clabon.
Good morning.

195
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,498
Is Mr. Ward in his office?

196
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,876
Yes, Mr. Rutland.
He's interviewing
for the new office assistant.

197
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,546
Rutland & Company is an old
established publishing...

198
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,383
Oh, Mr. Rutland.
This is Miss Blakely,
Mr. Rutland.

199
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,721
Well, you'll hear from us,
Miss Blakely, I'm sure.

200
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,764
Thank you very much.
Thank you for
your time, Mr. Ward.

201
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:28,059
Good day, Mr. Rutland.
Good day, Miss Blakely.

202
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:32,397
Well, I guess that does it.
She seems to have
the exact qualifications...

203
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,820
Come in. Come in for
a moment, please.

204
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:52,042
Now, sit down, Mrs. Taylor.
Thank you.

205
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,630
I have here your
Pittsburgh references.

206
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,717
Reference, that is.
Kendall's, yes.

207
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,886
This the only reference
you have to show us?

208
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,930
Well, Mr. Ward,
I have good training,

209
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,057
but I've had very
little actual experience.

210
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,100
Kendall's was my
first real job.

211
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,186
After I finished school,
I was married.

212
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,273
My husband was a CPA
and he helped me keep
up with my training.

213
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,359
I learnt a great
deal more from him,

214
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:20,528
accounting, cost-price,
even something
about computers.

215
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,780
I see.

216
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,824
When my husband died
very suddenly last November,

217
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:29,204
well, he left me
a little money, but
I felt I needed work.

218
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,498
Good, hard, demanding work.

219
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,751
I got the job at Kendall's,
but it was...

220
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,045
Well, it wasn't
a very exacting position,

221
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,005
and there didn't
seem much immediate

222
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,007
chance for anything
else at Kendall's.

223
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:42,300
Oh, I don't mean pay.

224
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:44,094
Salary isn't the most
important thing with me,

225
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,888
but more interesting work,
Mr. Ward.

226
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:50,433
Something that will
keep me busy, occupied.

227
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:54,646
Well, I don't care
how much work I'm given
or what hours I work.

228
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,066
Uh, but, Mrs. Taylor,
why did you leave Pittsburgh?

229
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,276
Well, after my
husband died, I just...

230
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,822
Now, Mrs. Taylor,
this is a post of
some confidence.

231
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:07,450
Oh, please, let me have
a chance to prove myself,
Mr. Ward.

232
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,544
Uh, very well, Mrs. Taylor.

233
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:21,006
I suppose you might as well
report to work on Monday.

234
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:27,053
Our Miss Clabon
in the outer office
will brief you.

235
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,559
I'll be out in just a moment.

236
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:35,061
Now, why are we taking
on someone without
the proper references?

237
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,354
You're always
such a stickler...

238
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:40,108
Let's just say I'm
an interested spectator
in the passing parade.

239
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,776
I don't get it.

240
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,821
You're not supposed
to get it.

241
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,368
Hi, Miss Clabon.
Fine, fortunately...

242
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,954
Hello, Mr. Sam.
How's the curmudgeon business?

243
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,832
Oh, Miss Mainwaring!

244
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,834
Is Mark in there?
I'm looking for a free lunch

245
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,961
and somebody to
cash a check for me.

246
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,547
I thought I'd stick
Mark for the lunch
and you for the cash.

247
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,257
Go right on in.

248
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,761
You have your
social security card, Mrs. Taylor?

249
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,804
Yes, of course.
It's right here in my purse.

250
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,890
Who's the dish?

251
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,769
Miss Clabon will
show you around.

252
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,562
She's been with
us for seven years.

253
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,815
I believe she's found
the work exacting enough.

254
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,151
Good day, Mrs. Taylor.
Miss Clabon,
will you call Personnel

255
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,486
and have them
send the forms up?

256
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,404
Certainly, Mr. Ward.

257
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,246
Hello.
This is Mr. Ward's office.

258
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:39,292
Would you please send up
a W-4 and the rest of
the employment forms?

259
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,420
Yes, before lunch.
I'll wait. Thank you.

260
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,424
Maud, what about Saturday?

261
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:51,346
No, I only thought
as you said your mother
wasn't coming with us,

262
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,808
I just wanted to make sure
about our reservations.

263
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,853
Well, why don't you
call me back?

264
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,772
All right. Any time.

265
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:09,656
Thanks, Mr. Sam.
I'll try not to do
anything sensible with it.

266
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:14,202
Bye, Miss Clabon.
Bye.

267
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:18,039
That's Lil Mainwaring,
Mr. Rutland's sister-in-law.

268
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:21,126
Her sister was
Mr. Rutland's wife.
Was?

269
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,462
Yes. She died about
a year and a half ago.
Some kind of heart thing.

270
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:26,506
Imagine. Only 29.

271
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:30,051
Well, anyway,
she kind of brought Lil up.

272
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,304
Lil lived with them
and old Mr. Rutland
down at Wykwyn.

273
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:37,392
I get the feeling
little old Lil plans
to stay on permanently.

274
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:42,707
Anyway, like I was saying,
old Mr. Rutland,
that's Mark's father,

275
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,627
they say he's never even been
inside this place.

276
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,295
And the company
was really headed

277
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,047
into the ground
when Mark took over.

278
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:52,133
They say the first week
he was here he retired...

279
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,719
Retired. Three board members,

280
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,055
the acting president,
the president's secretary,

281
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,224
and the secretary's secretary.

282
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,142
Coffee time, ladies.

283
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,273
Would you mind
bringing me a cup?

284
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,275
Just coffee? Doughnut,
Danish?

285
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:13,655
Oh, lady, have I got
for you a Danish!
No, just coffee.

286
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,198
Oh, I'm out of red ink.

287
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:16,824
Oh, here, use mine.

288
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:19,494
Oh, I'll get it.
No, no, I will.

289
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,332
Thanks.

290
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:49,023
Mrs. Taylor, are you hurt?
Mrs. Taylor!

291
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,069
I think she's hurt. Find out.

292
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,364
Mary, are you all right?

293
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,575
What?

294
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:02,662
Of course, I'm all right.
I just spilled a little
ink on my blouse.

295
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,122
The way you rushed
out of the office...

296
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:05,623
Mr. Rutland's
standing out there.

297
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,209
He said he thought
you were hurt.
Well, I'm not.

298
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:11,796
All that happened
was I spilled a little
ink on my blouse.

299
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,882
Good heavens.
What a lot of
excitement over nothing.

300
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,460
Why in the world
does he keep locking
and unlocking that drawer?

301
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,587
He never can remember
the safe combination.

302
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,047
It's kept locked
up in that drawer.

303
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:57,967
Mr. Rutland and I have
the keys to it, too,
for emergencies.

304
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,970
It's only five numbers,
for Pete's sake.

305
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:07,435
Mrs. Taylor?
I've just had a call
from Mr. Rutland, Mrs. Taylor.

306
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:11,856
He remembered your saying
you'd be willing
to work overtime.

307
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,525
He wondered if
you'd be prepared
to work on Saturday?

308
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,945
Saturday? Of course,
Mr. Ward. What time?
2:30.

309
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:21,949
I'll advise Mr. Rutland
that you are available.

310
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,837
Come in, Mrs. Taylor.

311
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,175
Good afternoon, Mr. Rutland.

312
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:29,392
Are you interested
in pre-Columbian art,
Mrs. Taylor?

313
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:32,395
Those were collected
by my wife. She's dead.

314
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,064
The only things
of hers I've kept.

315
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,234
And that's Sophie.

316
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:43,197
She's a jaguarondi.
South American.
I, uh, trained her.

317
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:46,200
Oh? What did you train
her to do?

318
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:47,952
To trust me.

319
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:49,996
Is that all?

320
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,124
Well, that's a great
deal for a jaguarondi.

321
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:58,004
Shall we get to work?
You can use the typewriter
over there.

322
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:00,298
I want an original
and one copy of this.

323
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:02,633
If you can't decipher
any of it, speak up.

324
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:06,053
I typed it myself
and I'm a very
creative typist.

325
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,980
"Arboreal Predators
of the Brazilian Rain Forest."

326
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,233
Before I was drafted
into Rutland's, Mrs. Taylor,

327
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,277
I had notions of
being a zoologist.

328
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:24,489
I still try to
keep up with my field.
Zoos?

329
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,658
Instinctual behavior.

330
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:28,743
Oh.

331
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,954
Does zoology include people,
Mr. Rutland?

332
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,832
Well, in a way.
It includes all
the animal ancestors

333
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,460
from whom man
derived his instincts.

334
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:39,378
Ladies' instincts, too?

335
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:43,049
Well, that paper deals with
the instincts of predators.

336
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:46,385
What you might call
the criminal class
of the animal world.

337
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,639
Lady animals figure
very largely as predators.

338
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:12,036
Put on the overhead
light if you like.
The switch is by the door.

339
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,387
Why don't you sit down,
Mrs. Taylor?

340
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:33,641
If the storm worries you
that much, I'll get you
something to drink.

341
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:36,852
Mrs. Taylor?

342
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,492
The building is grounded,
Mrs. Taylor.

343
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,039
You're quite safe here,

344
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,918
from the lightning.

345
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:08,718
The colors.
Stop the colors.
What colors?

346
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:51,302
It's over. All over.
You're all right.

347
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:54,221
Okay, now?

348
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,140
Would you like
something to drink?
Some brandy?

349
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,893
No, thank you.
I'm awfully sorry. I...

350
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:03,272
Oh, don't be silly.
What is it about
colors that bothers you?

351
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:07,735
Colors?
Mmm. You seem to be
terrified of some colors.

352
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,572
No, no. What I'm terrified of
is thunder and lightning.

353
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:17,787
You know, I wouldn't have
pegged you for a woman who'd
be terrified of anything.

354
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:33,594
Well, we've all
got to go some time.

355
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:37,682
Look, this place
is wrecked and you're
in no state to work.

356
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:40,059
Suppose I drive you home.
You can do this
job some other time.

357
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:43,104
Oh, thank you. I...
Go get your things.

358
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:51,278
It's cold and damp here.
I must get the
maintenance people in.

359
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,382
I'm really sorry
about the cabinet.

360
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:13,300
Why should you be?

361
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,846
You said it was all you
had left of your wife.

362
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:20,015
I said it was all I had left
that had belonged to my wife.

363
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,100
Oh.

364
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,980
Native Winkler is second.
Hopeless is third.

365
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:28,566
Oh, no, please.
I'd like to hear.

366
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:33,738
You like racing?
I like horses.
I go to the races when I can.

367
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,825
Was your husband a track fan?
Yes.

368
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,828
And you go alone now?
Yes.

369
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,666
Atlantic City track's open
till the end of the month.

370
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:48,544
We could drive out
there next Saturday.

371
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:53,340
All right.
Are you fond of horses?
No, not at all.

372
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:58,637
Fast Return moving up
on the outside.

373
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,788
Well, that's another one.

374
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:26,832
Oh, I like it here like this.

375
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:31,378
Well, you're the expert.
What do you like
in the next race?

376
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:34,256
Lemon Pudding.
He's finished third
his last three times out.

377
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,593
He's got a good
jockey up today.
Lemon Pudding it is.

378
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,471
The morning line
says he's four to one.

379
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,264
I'll get on him.

380
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:50,689
Pardon me, but you're
Peggy Nicholson, aren't you?

381
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,484
Remember me?

382
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,403
I'm sorry.
What did you say?

383
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,906
I said,
aren't you Peggy Nicholson?

384
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,407
No, I'm not.

385
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:04,620
Yeah? I was pretty sure
you were. You know, when
I first saw you down here...

386
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:08,082
No, I'm sorry,
you've made a mistake.
I am not Miss Nichols.

387
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,292
Nicholson.
Nicholson.

388
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,922
Frank Abernathy introduced us
a couple years ago in Detroit.

389
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,926
Frank Abernathy.
You remember Frank.

390
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:21,929
No, I do not know anyone
named Frank Abernathy.

391
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,266
I have never known anyone
named Frank Abernathy.

392
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:28,269
Now, will you please go?
Oh, come on now, honey,

393
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,604
you're trying to
pull my leg, aren't you?

394
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,691
Now, why should any young lady
want to pull your leg?

395
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:37,111
Oh, sorry. I thought
I recognized this lady.

396
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,071
Did he recognize you?
No.

397
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,906
You did not recognize her.

398
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:44,118
I said, I thought
I recognized her.
I said I'm sorry.

399
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:48,205
Well, good for you.
You've apologized nicely.
You may go now.

400
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,630
You came back so quickly.
Yes. Who's your fan?

401
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,592
You know,
I just seem to have
one of those faces.

402
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:01,802
Well, what do you
like in the next race?

403
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:04,555
Can we go to the paddock?
I'd like to see Telepathy.

404
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:09,059
Been watching him ever since
I saw him work out once
as a two-year-old.

405
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:35,836
Oh, I believe that's our
old friend Telepathy.

406
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:38,297
Yeah, number 8. Telepathy.

407
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,642
He's a lanky-looking piece
of business but I bow
to your superior knowledge.

408
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,352
What is it?
What's the matter?

409
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,771
Don't bet him.
Why not?

410
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:56,982
He's walleyed.
Can we go now?

411
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:15,084
What a paragon you are.
You don't smoke,
drink or gamble.

412
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:19,505
Just this once, for luck.
I don't believe in luck.

413
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:22,758
What do you believe in?
Nothing.

414
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,427
Oh, horses, maybe.

415
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:29,682
At least they're beautiful
and nothing in this
world like people.

416
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:33,060
Oh, yes, people.
Thoroughly bad lot.
Generally.

417
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,355
Did you have a tough
childhood, Mrs. Taylor?

418
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,190
Not particularly.

419
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:43,195
I think you did.
I think you've had
a hard, tough climb.

420
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,614
But you're a smart girl,
aren't you?

421
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:48,283
The careful grammar,
the quiet good manners.

422
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:51,412
Where did you learn them?
From my betters.

423
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,499
What about your tough
childhood, Mr. Rutland?

424
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,961
The old, sad story.
Promising youth blighted.

425
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:02,756
Dragged down by money,
position, noblesse oblige.

426
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:07,386
By the time I came along,
the company was
hanging on the ropes.

427
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,639
We had about a thousand
employees who were about
to go down for the count.

428
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:13,934
What about the Rutlands?
What would've happened
to your family?

429
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,645
Nothing ever
happens to a family
that traditionally marries

430
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:19,273
at least one heiress
every other generation.

431
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,318
Well, you shouldn't
have chickened.

432
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:26,447
Your walleyed reject
just won by four lengths.

433
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:33,454
I think I've had enough.
Can we go?
Well, if you like.

434
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,998
See here.
The track's open till
the end of the month.

435
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:39,126
That gives us
two more Saturdays.

436
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,255
If your luck holds out,
by this time next month,
I'll be a rich man.

437
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:56,560
Oh, Miss Nicholson.
You really are pressing
your luck, old boy.

438
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:06,445
Where are we going this time?

439
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:10,115
I thought it was time
I brought you home
to meet my old man.

440
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,410
Oh, you should've told me.
You're all right.

441
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:17,081
Dad goes by scent.
If you smell anything
like a horse, you're in.

442
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:38,477
Here we are, old bean.
The homestead.

443
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,953
Hello, Dad.
Who's this?

444
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,996
This is Mary Taylor.
Mary, this is my father.

445
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,332
How do you do, Mr. Rutland?
A girl, is it?

446
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,836
Oh, it's all right, Dad.
She's not really a girl,
she's a horse-fancier.

447
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,921
Now that the track's closed,
I thought if
I brought her round

448
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,507
to see your horses,
I'd hold her
attention a bit longer.

449
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,008
Splendid, splendid!

450
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:13,929
Come along, my dear.
I was just about to
have a cup of tea.

451
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:23,021
Oh, Mary,
this is my sister-in-law,
Lil Mainwaring.

452
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,274
Mary Taylor.
How do you do?

453
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,526
Hi. I've seen you at
Rutland's, haven't I?

454
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:31,488
It bewilders me what any of you can find
to do at Rutland's.

455
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:38,662
Oh, dear!
I think I rather sprained
my wrist this afternoon.

456
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,874
There's sure to be
droppage and spillage.

457
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:44,001
Would you mind awfully?

458
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,964
Strong, please.
No milk, two lumps of sugar.

459
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,133
The meals in this
house are shocking bad,

460
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,678
but I do insist on good
Horn & Hardart cake at tea.

461
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,723
You take yours with lemon,
don't you, Lil?

462
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,642
Yes. Lemon for Lil, Mary.

463
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:05,814
-Strong with a dash of rum for me.
-Spinster's tea.

464
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:09,818
Mucking up tea
with strong drink.
Something sneaky about it, eh?

465
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:11,987
What's your opinion,
Miss Taylor?

466
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,489
Do you think old Mark
here is a sneaky one?

467
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,825
Possibly.

468
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:21,538
How do you take
your tea, Miss Taylor?

469
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:24,208
Usually with a cup
of hot water and a tea bag.

470
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,293
Lazy habit, my dear.

471
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,588
I'll have quite a large slice
of that butter cake, please.

472
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,882
Do you ride, Miss Taylor?
A little.

473
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,593
Best thing in the world for the inside
of a man or a woman

474
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,803
is the outside of a horse.

475
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,348
I shouldn't think
you'd find old Mark
very interesting.

476
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:40,766
Doesn't hunt.
Doesn't even ride.

477
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,894
Please, Dad.
I was hoping to lead
up gently to all that.

478
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,563
I'd even planned
to show her the horses first.

479
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,608
Swill that down
or bring it with
you to the stables.

480
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,819
Mark's trying to behave
as if he brought Miss Taylor
out to see the horses.

481
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:56,240
He really
brought her to see me.
Really? Whatever for?

482
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:59,451
Showing off. I'm quite a presentable
old party, you know.

483
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:03,622
Lil, I'm sure your
sturdy young wrist
has recovered sufficiently

484
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,374
to pour Dad
another cup of tea.

485
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,751
Yes, I will have another cup.
I can't!

486
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,379
"When Duty whispers low,
Thou must.

487
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,756
"Then youth replies, I can."

488
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,594
Ratfink! And you misquoted!

489
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,791
Will you come out
and spend next
weekend with us?

490
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:51,670
You can bring your tea bag,
have your pick of the horses.

491
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,095
Good night, Mary.
I have to run.
See you on Monday.

492
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,430
Good night, Susan.

493
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:03,598
Good night!
See you Monday.

494
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:07,894
Good night. See you on Monday.

495
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,707
I haven't got my powder puff.
Have you got one?

496
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,167
Yeah, here.

497
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,586
-Come on.
-Wait a minute.

498
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:36,256
Come on.
All right, I'm coming.

499
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:39,801
You mean you just
have to hang around
and wait until he calls?

500
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:42,262
Good night, girls.
Good night. I'll see you.

501
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:44,014
I think that's...
Have a good weekend.

502
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,640
Yeah, I think that's...

503
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,895
What are you gonna do?
Well, I don't know.
Let's get home.

504
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:51,646
Because he may have
already called you.
Oh, well.

505
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:53,106
If I miss his call,
that's the way it goes.

506
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,650
Oh, this is
the best one you've had!

507
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,210
See you next week.

508
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,722
You're sure making
time tonight, Rita.
What's the big rush?

509
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:56,808
I want to get to bed.
That's the big rush.

510
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:32,844
Please get down.

511
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:36,389
You'll walk back to
the stables. I'll ride.

512
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:42,020
Are you staying at an inn
or have you friends
among the local gentry?

513
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:44,898
You said you
didn't trust horses.
I don't, but they trust me.

514
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:48,568
Which brings us directly
to our relationship,
Miss Edgar!

515
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:02,749
Is Edgar your real name?
And you're blonde.

516
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:04,626
You'll save
a good deal of time

517
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:07,545
and make for a better
feeling all round if you
just tell me the truth.

518
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,631
Is Edgar your real name?

519
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:11,591
Now, don't crowd me, lady!

520
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:15,595
I'm fighting a powerful
impulse to beat
the hell out of you.

521
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,139
At last we communicate.

522
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:21,476
Now, for the third
and last time,
is Edgar your real name?

523
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,145
And don't bother
to lie to me. I'll check
you out in every detail.

524
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,398
Yes, Edgar. Margaret Edgar!

525
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,025
Now, where are you from?

526
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:31,486
California.
Where in California?

527
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,154
Los Angeles.

528
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:35,031
Where's the money?

529
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,285
Here! Some of it.

530
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,996
Where's the rest?
Oh, don't worry. It's safe.

531
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:44,082
Safe? At some
pari-mutuel window?

532
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,251
Or has it gone
for an operation
for your old sick mother?

533
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:49,254
Or perhaps you're
putting your kid brother
through school?

534
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:52,173
I don't have a kid
brother or a mother.
I don't have anybody.

535
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:53,675
Not even Mr. Taylor?

536
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,428
You know, I wouldn't be
a bit surprised to hear
that the rest of the haul

537
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:58,680
is with your late husband,
Mr. Taylor.

538
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:02,684
Somewhere around these parts,
I expect to find him
happily reincarnated,

539
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:06,020
and the pockets of his
good blue burial suit
bulging with Rutland money.

540
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:09,107
The rest of the money is
in a registered
package addressed to me

541
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:10,900
in a post office
box in New York.

542
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:13,903
You can pick it up
there by tomorrow.
Here's the key.

543
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:17,991
Thank you, Miss Edgar.
Now I'll take
the registration receipt.

544
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:23,747
This receipt and the unopened
package are as good as
a signed confession.

545
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,373
You understand that?

546
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,834
All right.
Now, where does
Mr. Taylor come in?

547
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,378
There's no such person.
I've never been married.

548
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:32,714
Mrs. Taylor was an old
friend of my mother's.

549
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,340
And when you
applied at Rutland's,

550
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,092
the name just
came to your mind.

551
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:39,763
I was trying to get away
from someone. I have a
cousin Jessie. She's no good.

552
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:43,099
I was afraid if she found out
about the insurance money,

553
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:45,393
she'd try to get a part of it.
Make trouble for me.

554
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:48,229
What insurance money?

555
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:52,275
Mrs. Taylor's. She died.
Oh, Mrs. Taylor died. Pity.

556
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,778
Now you're working
with this naughty
cousin Jessie.

557
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,696
Nobody's working with me!

558
00:51:56,781 --> 00:52:00,074
You talk as if
this was some kind
of regular thing I do, did.

559
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:01,743
All planned out
in cold blood.

560
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,870
And it wasn't?
No!

561
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,081
You're not from Los Angeles,
Miss Edgar.

562
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,459
Insurance is only
pronounced "insurance"
in the South,

563
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:12,337
and that's where you're from.
Where? Around here?

564
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:15,256
You're a cold,
practiced little
method actress of a liar.

565
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:17,717
I can't help it.
It would appear not.

566
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:19,511
I don't mean that.

567
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:23,807
I mean, I wasn't born in
California. I was born in
Richmond, Virginia.

568
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:26,226
My father deserted
us when I was a baby.

569
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:29,521
My mother and I
lived in Richmond
until I was seven.

570
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:31,648
And then we
moved to California,

571
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:34,025
where Mother could get work
in the airplane factories.

572
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,944
That's the truth. I swear it!

573
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:40,448
My mother died when I was 10,
and Mrs. Taylor took
care of me out there.

574
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:42,784
Come on, get moving.

575
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:46,204
How did you find me?

576
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:49,374
You're here to answer
the questions, old girl.

577
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:51,751
Now how did you
get the combination
to Ward's safe?

578
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:54,462
I took Susan's
key from her purse.

579
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:56,339
I see.

580
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:59,509
Now, suppose you just
begin at the beginning.

581
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:05,265
It's just like I told you.
I was born in Richmond.
We were poor.

582
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:08,101
We were grindingly poor.

583
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:15,275
I was so horribly
alone after Mother died.

584
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:18,945
Well, go on.
You still have my attention.

585
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:24,617
I just went to school
and took care of
Mrs. Taylor until she died.

586
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:30,123
She left me her house
and $5,000 in insurance.

587
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:38,464
I sold the house.
It had a mortgage so I
only got $9,000 cash.

588
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:46,055
But there I was with $14,000.
Me! I could do exactly
what I wanted to with it.

589
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:51,352
There isn't much more.
I bought Forio.
Forio?

590
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:55,857
My horse at Garrod's.
I had two wonderful years.

591
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:59,527
Then last November
it was all gone
so I had to get a job.

592
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,654
I went to Pittsburgh
and got the job at Kendall's

593
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,656
until I could look around
for something better.

594
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,783
All right, let's try again.

595
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:10,997
Let's back up and see if you
can turn that Mount Everest
of manure into a few facts.

596
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,916
One, your dates
are all wrong.

597
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,877
Previously you were
employed by the firm
of Strutt & Company.

598
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:17,837
I saw you there once.

599
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:21,799
Mr. Strutt is
the tax consultant
for Rutland & Company.

600
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:24,677
He pointed you out to me
and you were a brunette then.

601
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:28,556
And then some months later
he pointed out your absence.

602
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:31,225
You mean, you knew all about
that when you hired me?

603
00:54:31,352 --> 00:54:32,936
No. I wasn't positive.

604
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,856
But I thought it
might be interesting
to keep you around.

605
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:41,444
And all this time
you've been trying to
trip me up, trap me!

606
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:47,575
Um, I'm not sure anymore.
I think I was just
curious at first.

607
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:52,372
And then things
got out of control
and I liked you.

608
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,082
So I see!

609
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:57,418
Incidentally, I think
you took a bit of a chance,

610
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:01,673
knowing that Rutland's
was a client of Strutt's.

611
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:04,467
I didn't. My job at Strutt's
didn't give me access

612
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,719
to all the clients' names!

613
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:10,390
All right. Let's get on.

614
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:13,393
We've established
that you're a thief
and a liar.

615
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:15,269
Now, what is the degree?

616
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:18,356
Are you a compulsive thief?
A pathological liar?

617
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:21,234
Oh, what difference
does it make?
Some.

618
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,737
It makes some
difference to me.

619
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,704
Have you ever been in jail?

620
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:34,414
Certainly not.

621
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:39,961
I know you'll
never believe me now
and it's my own fault.

622
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:44,090
It's true about Strutt.
I did it. I don't know why.

623
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:49,178
I just kind of
went crazy, I guess,
but old Mr. Strutt was so...

624
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:50,471
Oh, I hated him!

625
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:53,182
Like you hate me?

626
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:56,644
Oh, no, not you.

627
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,196
Clean up your face.

628
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,203
Come on.

629
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,443
Good afternoon.

630
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:58,581
What'll you folks have?
A frank and a coffee, please.

631
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,792
Same for me.
Okey-doke.

632
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:05,004
Let's get on with
that little discussion.

633
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:08,716
The chronic use
of an alias is not
consistent with your story

634
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:12,678
of sudden temptation
and unpremeditated impulse.

635
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:18,017
If you'd stolen almost
$10,000, wouldn't you
change your name?

636
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:21,979
Oh, what's the use?
Why should I even try
to make you understand?

637
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:24,732
I'm not only trying
to understand you, I'm even
trying to believe you.

638
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:27,360
Why?
Because, damn it, I want to.

639
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:29,695
Can you understand that?

640
00:57:30,823 --> 00:57:32,698
Here you are, folks.

641
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,076
Mark?

642
00:57:37,538 --> 00:57:40,373
The reasons for what
I did at Rutland's,

643
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:45,211
they were so mixed up,
what I wanted to say before.

644
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:51,843
I needed to get away,
can't you see?
Away from Rutland's.

645
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:57,014
Don't you understand?
Things were... We were...

646
00:57:57,099 --> 00:57:59,725
So we were.
Was that any
reason to run away?

647
00:57:59,852 --> 00:58:02,270
Yes, I thought it was time
I got out before I got hurt.

648
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:04,689
I mean, why try
to kid myself?

649
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,733
Are you called Margaret?
Marnie.

650
00:58:10,863 --> 00:58:15,700
Oh, God, Mark,
if you let me go, I swear...
I can't let you go, Marnie.

651
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:19,412
Somebody's got to take
care of you and help you.
I can't just turn you loose.

652
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:23,833
If I let you go,
I'm criminally and
morally responsible.

653
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,668
Well, then, what...

654
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,088
Marnie. Yeah, that suits you.

655
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:35,011
All right, Marnie,
this is how it's gonna be.

656
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:37,847
I'm driving you
back to Philadelphia.

657
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:41,017
Tonight we'll go to
the house. Tomorrow
you'll return to Rutland's.

658
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:44,770
You'll see that Susan's
key finds its way
back into her purse.

659
00:58:44,897 --> 00:58:46,772
How can I go
back to Rutland's?

660
00:58:46,899 --> 00:58:49,567
You're covered.
I replaced the money.

661
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,446
When I called to
pick you up yesterday
and found you'd pulled out,

662
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,948
I knew instantly
what had happened.

663
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:58,784
So I went to Rutland's
and checked Ward's safe.

664
00:58:58,911 --> 00:59:01,787
Figured the loss
and replaced it.

665
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:04,123
Then I set out to find you.

666
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:05,458
Remember that
first day at the races

667
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,961
when you were so hot
about a horse
called Telepathy?

668
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:12,215
I remember, you'd said
you'd watched him training
as a two-year-old.

669
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:14,800
That's all I had to go on,
so I looked him up,

670
00:59:14,927 --> 00:59:19,222
and found he'd been
bred by a Colonel
Marston of Virginia.

671
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:21,390
I phoned Marston and asked him

672
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:24,644
if there was anywhere
around there that they
had horses for hire.

673
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:27,563
He gave me the names of three.

674
00:59:27,648 --> 00:59:30,983
Yesterday I drove up to
the plains, checked out
the stables. No luck.

675
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:34,987
But at the last place,
the man said why
didn't I try Garrod's,

676
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,948
over by Middleburg?

677
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,993
You folks be sure
and come back now.

678
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:45,915
Why are you taking
me back to Wykwyn?

679
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,501
Because I don't trust
you not to run away.

680
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:50,753
How can I run away?

681
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:54,757
You have the receipt,
the post office key, my name.

682
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:58,511
Margaret Edgar.
You sure that's all
the name you have?

683
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,471
You sure you haven't misplaced
an old husband or two

684
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:04,267
somewhere in your travels?
I told you I've
never been married.

685
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:06,269
Near misses?
No.

686
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:10,982
And no lovers, no steadies,
no beaus, no gentlemen
callers, nothing!

687
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,609
Okay. Eat up.

688
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:20,866
Mark, I'd like to go
freshen up a little.
Uh-uh.

689
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:23,327
You're fresh enough. Come on.

690
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,215
You know, I can't
believe you, Marnie.

691
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,135
There must've been
a great many men
interested in you.

692
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:41,095
I didn't say men
weren't interested in me.

693
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:43,139
I said I wasn't
interested in them.

694
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:44,682
Never?
No.

695
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:49,395
That is, not until...

696
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:51,856
Why me?

697
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:55,318
Because you were
different, Mark.

698
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:58,070
It won't wash, Marnie.

699
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:00,740
But it's true.
I really liked you.

700
01:01:02,034 --> 01:01:03,659
Yes, I think you did.

701
01:01:03,744 --> 01:01:06,996
But don't try to make it sound
like any more than that.

702
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:11,667
When we get home,
I'll explain that we
had a lover's quarrel.

703
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:15,087
That you ran away,
that I went after you
and brought you back.

704
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:18,007
That'll please Dad.
He admires action.

705
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:22,428
Then I'll explain that
we're gonna be married
before the week is out,

706
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,347
therefore you
should stay on at Wykwyn.

707
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:26,849
That I can't bear
to have you out of my sight.

708
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:30,519
He also admires
wholesome animal lust.

709
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:33,189
We'll be married
just as soon as
the law allows.

710
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:35,358
We'll catch an outbound boat.

711
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:37,860
Where do you want to go?
You ever been to
the South Seas?

712
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,237
What are you trying to pull?

713
01:01:40,781 --> 01:01:45,117
I'm trying to pull
a proposal. Let's see,
how shall I phrase it?

714
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:48,120
How about "will you be mine"?

715
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:50,164
You're crazy!
You're out of your mind!

716
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:52,249
That's a possibility.

717
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,628
The name Marnie.
Yes, I'll just go on
calling you Marnie.

718
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:58,297
That's easily explained.
Pet name.

719
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:00,299
But the Taylor...

720
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:03,636
We'll just have to marry
you off as Mary Taylor.
It's perfectly legal.

721
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:07,223
You can sign yourself
Minnie Q Mouse
on a marriage license,

722
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:09,058
you're still legally married.

723
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,893
But you know what I am.

724
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:14,230
I'm Minnie Q Thief!
I'm a thief and a liar and...

725
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:19,276
Well, it seems to be my
misfortune to have fallen in
love with a thief and a liar.

726
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,820
In love?

727
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,741
Oh, Mark, if you love me,
you'll let me go.

728
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:28,744
Just let me go, Mark, please.

729
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,664
Mark, you don't know me.

730
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:39,088
Oh, listen to me, Mark.
I am not like other people.
I know what I am!

731
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,589
I doubt that you do, Marnie.

732
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:44,510
In any event, we'll just
have to deal with whatever
it is that you are.

733
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,929
Whatever you are, I love you.

734
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:51,308
It's horrible, I know.
But I do love you.

735
01:02:51,977 --> 01:02:56,939
You don't love me. I'm just
something you've caught.

736
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,025
You think I'm some kind
of animal you've trapped.

737
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,777
That's right, you are.

738
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:05,531
And I've caught something
really wild this time,
haven't I?

739
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:09,201
I've tracked you and
caught you, and by God,
I'm gonna keep you!

740
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,036
Oh, and, Marnie,
when we get home,

741
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:14,457
no cute ideas about absconding
with the Wykwyn silver.

742
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:16,375
Just get a grip on yourself
for one short week

743
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:19,044
and after that,
well, you can take
legal possession.

744
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:22,673
Like you? Like you
take legal possession?

745
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:26,886
Yes, if you want
to put it that way.

746
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:30,055
Somebody's got to take
on the responsibility
for you, Marnie.

747
01:03:30,182 --> 01:03:34,226
And it narrows down
to a choice of me or
the police, old girl.

748
01:03:49,451 --> 01:03:51,368
Indispensable.

749
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:55,164
Ah, Cousin Bob,
I almost forgot. Do you
have the old necessary?

750
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,458
Have fun, my dear.
Traveler's checks in this.

751
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,919
Letter of credit in this.
Thanks, old man.

752
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:03,130
Will you see about
having my car picked up
at the airport?

753
01:04:03,215 --> 01:04:06,425
Bob is our banking cousin.
A very handy fellow.

754
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:14,391
Take care, Lil.
We'll send you a noble savage.

755
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:15,809
Goodbye, Dad.
Bye, Mark.

756
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:18,979
Thank you, Dr. Gillian.
Without you it wouldn't
have been legal.

757
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:20,981
It's been a pleasure.

758
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,534
Let's go back and finish the champagne and cake
before they spirit it away.

759
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:35,287
Really splendid cake,
you know? I attended
to that myself.

760
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:38,958
I've made the acquaintance
of one of those excellent
Horn & Hardart executives.

761
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:43,212
That engagement ring
must have been
at least five carats.

762
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:47,508
Six and a half.
Blue-white.
Perfect stone.

763
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,218
His mother left
perfectly good jewelry.

764
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:51,720
It's just sitting
there at the bank
in safety deposit.

765
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:55,724
He said he wanted her to have
something that had never
belonged to anyone else.

766
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:58,018
But six and a half carats!

767
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:01,105
And cashing in a bond
to pay for a ring.

768
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:05,609
But he didn't pay for it.
He charged it.
I helped him pick it out.

769
01:05:05,694 --> 01:05:10,114
It cost $42,000, plus tax.

770
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:12,908
Did you say $42,000?

771
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:16,287
The man's deranged.

772
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,747
You know what he did
to me last Saturday?

773
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:23,002
He came out to the club
waving a check for $7,000

774
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:26,171
and insisted that I
break up my golf game,
go in and open the bank

775
01:05:26,298 --> 01:05:29,174
and hand over to him $7,000.

776
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:31,093
Then he drew out...

777
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:35,431
Well, let's just say enough
to pay for this trip plus
the letter of credit.

778
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:39,852
He cashed that very nice bond
against my advice,

779
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:42,938
made me get him the money.
$10,000 in small bills.

780
01:05:43,023 --> 01:05:46,775
And when I asked him why
he wanted $10,000 in
small bills, he said,

781
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:51,363
"Well, old man, I'm being
blackmailed and they
specified small bills."

782
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:55,367
I know that most people find
Mark's humor charming.

783
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:59,830
I do not.
There is nothing charming
about running through,

784
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:05,377
including the unpaid
bill for a ring,

785
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:08,797
approximately
$70,000 in one week.

786
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:14,470
A $6,000 or $7,000
South Seas honeymoon,
conservatively speaking,

787
01:06:14,554 --> 01:06:16,972
and a $42,000 ring.

788
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:20,351
All that money
spent to celebrate what?

789
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:23,312
This meager,
furtive little wedding?

790
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:24,855
He didn't even ask Mother.

791
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:18,575
"Pay off Strutt."

792
01:07:20,412 --> 01:07:21,537
Strutt.

793
01:07:59,451 --> 01:08:00,659
Booze?

794
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:03,829
Shall I fix you a drink?

795
01:08:13,173 --> 01:08:15,174
Would you like some bourbon
to brush your teeth?

796
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,842
No, thank you.

797
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:23,849
Contrary to the movies
and the Ladies' Home Journal,

798
01:08:23,975 --> 01:08:29,521
the battleground
of marriage is not,
I repeat, not the bedroom.

799
01:08:30,482 --> 01:08:33,317
The real field of
battle is the bath.

800
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,611
It is in the bath
and for the bath

801
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:38,864
that the lines are drawn
and no quarter given.

802
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:42,701
It seems to me, we are
getting off to a dangerously
poor start, darling.

803
01:08:42,786 --> 01:08:45,996
You've been in the bathroom
exactly 47 minutes.

804
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:51,877
You can have
the bath now.
Thank you.

805
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:57,049
You're very sexy
with your face clean.

806
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,386
Marnie, come here.

807
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:13,732
Sit down.

808
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:30,040
I can't! I can't! I can't!

809
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:32,417
For God's sakes, Marnie!

810
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:38,674
I can't stand it. I'll die.
If you touch me again,
I'll die!

811
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:44,346
I won't touch you.
I promise I won't touch you.

812
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:47,432
Just get out of that
damn corner, please.

813
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:52,604
Now, suppose you tell me
what this is all about.

814
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:56,191
Is it your own little way
of saying you don't find me
particularly attractive?

815
01:09:56,276 --> 01:09:58,610
I told you not to marry me.
I told you!

816
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:01,613
Oh, God, why couldn't you
have just let me go?

817
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:05,284
Marnie.
Don't. Please, don't!

818
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:08,287
Let me fix you a drink.
I don't want a drink.

819
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:11,373
At least have a brandy.
I don't want it.
Just leave me alone.

820
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:14,459
Not till I find out
what's the matter with you
and find some way to help you.

821
01:10:14,586 --> 01:10:18,046
The only way you can help me
is to leave me alone!

822
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:20,549
Can't you understand?
Isn't it plain enough?

823
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:22,593
I cannot bear to be handled!

824
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:26,305
By anybody? Or just me?
You. Men.

825
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:31,310
Really?

826
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:35,397
You didn't seem to mind
at my office that day,
or at the stables.

827
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:39,610
And all this last
week I've handled you,
kissed you many times.

828
01:10:40,612 --> 01:10:44,323
Why didn't you break out
in a cold sweat and back
into a corner then?

829
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:47,242
I thought I could
stand it if I had to.

830
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:49,661
I see.

831
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:53,415
Well, have you
always felt like this?
Always, yes.

832
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:55,000
Why? What happened to you?

833
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:58,086
Happened? Nothing.
Nothing happened to me.

834
01:10:58,171 --> 01:11:01,089
I just never wanted
anybody to touch me.

835
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:03,425
You ever tried
to talk about it,

836
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:05,677
to a doctor or somebody
who could help you?

837
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:08,680
No, why should I?
I didn't want to get married.

838
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:13,101
It's degrading. It's animal.
Anyway, I was doing
all right the way I was.

839
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:14,853
I wouldn't say that, Marnie.

840
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:16,939
If I hadn't caught you,
you'd have gone on stealing.

841
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:21,610
No. No I wouldn't.
Yes, you would,
again and again.

842
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:24,696
Eventually, you would've
got caught by somebody.

843
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:27,115
Since you're such
a tempting little thing.

844
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,953
Some other sexual blackmailer
would've got his hands on you.

845
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:35,791
The chances of it being
someone as permissive as me
are pretty remote.

846
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:37,793
Sooner or later
you'd have gone to jail.

847
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:42,047
Or been cornered in an office
by some angry old bull
of a businessman

848
01:11:42,173 --> 01:11:44,633
who was out to take
what he figured
was coming to him.

849
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:47,302
You'd probably
have got him and jail.

850
01:11:47,387 --> 01:11:50,222
So I wouldn't say
you were doing
all right, Marnie.

851
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:52,474
I'd say you needed
all the help you could get.

852
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:54,893
Well, I don't need your help.

853
01:11:55,395 --> 01:11:59,898
I don't think you're capable
of judging what you need or
from whom you need it.

854
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:03,860
What you do need, I expect,
is a psychiatrist.

855
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:07,739
Oh, men! You say "no thanks"
to one of them,

856
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:10,575
and bingo, you're a candidate
for the funny farm.

857
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:13,745
It would be hilarious
if it weren't pathetic.

858
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,916
Let's try to get some
rest, hmm? We'll talk
this out tomorrow.

859
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:21,503
There's nothing to talk out.
I've told you how I feel.

860
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:26,258
I'll feel the same way
tomorrow, and the day after,
and the day after that.

861
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:30,262
All right, Marnie.
We won't talk about
it until you want to.

862
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:34,433
But we're gonna be
on this damn boat
for many days and nights.

863
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:36,184
So, let's just
drop the whole thing
for the present

864
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:38,353
and try to get through
this bloody honeymoon cruise

865
01:12:38,438 --> 01:12:40,939
with as much grace
as possible.

866
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:44,776
Let's try at least to
be kind to each other.

867
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:46,236
Oh. Kind!

868
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:48,947
All right, if that's
too much,

869
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:52,409
I'll be kind to you,
and you'll be polite to me.

870
01:12:52,744 --> 01:12:54,119
You won't...

871
01:12:56,456 --> 01:12:57,789
I won't.

872
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:01,960
I give you my word.

873
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:08,050
Now, let's try to get
some rest. How about it?

874
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:12,637
You in your little bed over
there, and me light years
away in mine here.

875
01:13:14,432 --> 01:13:15,807
Thank you.

876
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:20,812
I think I'd like to stay
out here for a while,
but thank you.

877
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:37,996
You're gonna bring
a little pizzazz down to
the old farm, my dear.

878
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:40,791
I noticed before we left,
Dad was pulling out
his silk shirts.

879
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:43,418
What do you mean,
what will I do with myself?

880
01:13:43,503 --> 01:13:45,921
I had of course assumed
I would become
a society hostess.

881
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:50,050
In Africa, in Kenya,
there's quite
a beautiful flower.

882
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:53,595
It's coral colored with
little green-tipped blossoms,

883
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:56,014
rather like a hyacinth.

884
01:13:56,724 --> 01:13:58,934
If you reach out to touch it,

885
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:02,521
you'd discover that the flower
was not a flower at all,

886
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:07,776
but a design made up
of hundreds of tiny insects
called fattid bugs.

887
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:12,531
They escape the eyes of hungry
birds by living and dying
in the shape of a flower.

888
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:32,175
I'll close the door,
if you don't mind.
The light bothers me.

889
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:38,807
Hmm, what's that, dear?
The light? Oh, yes, of course.

890
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:42,811
You've been an absolute
darling about my sitting up
reading so late these nights.

891
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:45,397
I'm boning up on marine life

892
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:48,191
since entomology doesn't
seem to be your subject,

893
01:14:48,276 --> 01:14:51,444
and I'm eager to
find a subject,
Marnie, any subject.

894
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:56,700
All right.
Here's a subject. How long?

895
01:14:56,784 --> 01:15:00,537
How long do we have to stay
on this boat, this trip?

896
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:02,956
How long before
we can go back?

897
01:15:03,082 --> 01:15:04,624
Why, Mrs. Rutland.

898
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:08,753
Can you be suggesting
that these halcyon
honeymoon days and nights,

899
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,424
just the two of
us alone together,
should ever end?

900
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:22,767
If you don't mind,
I'd like to go to bed.

901
01:15:22,894 --> 01:15:25,437
I've told you the light from
the sitting room bothers me.

902
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:29,983
Well, we certainly
can't have anything
bothering you, can we?

903
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:33,278
If you don't want
to go to bed,
please get out.

904
01:15:34,614 --> 01:15:38,950
But I do want to
go to bed, Marnie.
I very much want to go to bed.

905
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:41,161
No!

906
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:53,673
I'm sorry, Marnie.

907
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:24,300
Why the hell didn't
you jump over the side?

908
01:19:24,552 --> 01:19:28,304
The idea was to kill myself,
not feed the damn fish.

909
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:37,981
Mark!

910
01:19:38,858 --> 01:19:42,485
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
Was Fiji grisly?

911
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:45,905
Well, we didn't get to Fiji.
We jumped ship in
Honolulu and flew back.

912
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:49,909
And we had to take a cab
from the airport. We're both
a bit tired and grimy.

913
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:52,245
Remember when you were six,
you wanted to go to New York?

914
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:54,789
I warned you then
that traveling
was a nasty business.

915
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:56,583
You poor things.
You must be exhausted.

916
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:58,960
Yeah, I think what we'll do
is go straight up,
have a fast drink,

917
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:00,420
and pop up to bed.

918
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:03,006
The travel lecture
will have to wait
for morning, okay?

919
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:05,300
Where's the rest
of your luggage?
At the airport.

920
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:07,260
Goodnight, Dad.
I'll have breakfast
with you in the morning.

921
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:10,346
We'll see you then, Lil.
Goodnight, Mark.

922
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:20,940
Come on, Marnie.

923
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:24,360
It's not exactly a house
of correction, you know.

924
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:14,160
Look, Marnie, for the present,
all we've got is the facade,

925
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:16,246
and we've got to live it.

926
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:18,581
Dad has breakfast downstairs
at 8:30 every morning

927
01:21:18,666 --> 01:21:20,542
and I always join him.

928
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:23,628
So, naturally,
as you want to be with me...

929
01:21:30,261 --> 01:21:34,556
This is the drill, dear.
Wife follows husband
to front door.

930
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,474
Gives and/or gets a kiss.

931
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:42,355
Stands pensively as he
drives away. Oh, a wistful
little wave is optional.

932
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:58,413
Mark, are you going
to the office?

933
01:21:58,497 --> 01:22:01,666
On the first day back
after our honeymoon?
How indelicate.

934
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:06,087
No, I'm going down the road
on a little errand.
I'll see you later.

935
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:10,466
Mark, I, um...
I don't have any money.

936
01:22:10,551 --> 01:22:11,884
Oh, I'm sorry, Marnie.

937
01:22:12,011 --> 01:22:15,096
I'll call Bob and have him
make out an account for you.

938
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:16,598
It won't be much for a while.

939
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:20,184
You understand, I've had
a lot of heavy expenses.

940
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:23,521
And you might as well know
I've paid off Strutt.

941
01:22:23,606 --> 01:22:25,690
Anonymously, of course.

942
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:28,776
But that's all over!
So?

943
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:33,573
So, you've given away $10,000,
so you're a prize fool!

944
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:36,909
Possibly, but they don't put you in jail
for being a fool.

945
01:22:37,036 --> 01:22:40,288
I'm not the one the cops
are after. Not yet.
And I don't intend to be.

946
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:42,165
Not if there's anything
I could do to prevent it.

947
01:22:42,249 --> 01:22:44,709
Perhaps you, madam,
but not me.

948
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:44,143
Hello, Mama?
No, I'm all right.
I'm perfectly all right now.

949
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:48,314
I had a bad case
of the flu and just
didn't feel up to writing.

950
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:51,526
Oh, I couldn't.
I had laryngitis, too.

951
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:54,779
Oh, yes, I am still
a little hoarse.

952
01:23:56,782 --> 01:24:00,201
Look, Mama, I can't talk long.
I just called to tell
you that I'm all right

953
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:03,287
and that I'll send you
some money this week.

954
01:24:03,664 --> 01:24:06,082
No, I can't.
I don't know when
I'll get to Baltimore.

955
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:10,128
But not for
a few weeks anyway.
But I'll talk to you soon.

956
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:15,800
If you need anything, just
write to me at the same post
office box in Philadelphia.

957
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:18,511
I've got to go now, Mama.

958
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:20,972
Goodbye. Goodbye, Mama.

959
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:06,267
Oh, Forio! Oh, beauty!

960
01:25:38,717 --> 01:25:41,427
Well, she said she
could ride a little.

961
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:44,722
Mark?
Hmm?

962
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:48,559
Mark, listen.
I'm a good fighter
if you need me.

963
01:25:49,228 --> 01:25:51,437
I mean, if you are in
some kind of trouble.

964
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:55,733
I have absolutely
no scruples. I'd lie to
the police or anything.

965
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:58,152
What on Earth are
you talking about?

966
01:25:58,237 --> 01:26:01,572
I heard you and Marnie
this morning right out here.

967
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:04,075
Heard?
Okay, I eavesdropped.

968
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:08,162
We should've made
you go to college
or come out or something.

969
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:11,332
I can see that now.
Don't patronize me, Mark.

970
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:15,628
That Mary-Marnie
brown-haired blonde
you married so fast and sneaky

971
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:19,006
and tried to hustle off
to the South Pacific,
for Pete's sake.

972
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:23,553
I didn't have to overhear
stuff about your not
intending to go to jail, too,

973
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:26,597
to know that you're
in some sort of fix.

974
01:26:27,266 --> 01:26:30,393
Please, Mark,
will you let me help?
All right, you can help.

975
01:26:30,477 --> 01:26:34,272
You can help by
being nice to Marnie.
She needs a friend.

976
01:26:34,982 --> 01:26:38,943
I always thought
that a girl's best
friend was her mother.

977
01:26:39,987 --> 01:26:43,447
Poor old Mark.
Is her mother that ghastly?

978
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:47,034
I mean, when the in-laws
are so grim, you don't dare
have them to the wedding.

979
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:51,038
The usual excuse is poor
health or the strain
of the trip, you know?

980
01:26:51,123 --> 01:26:54,166
But to claim they're dead,
now, come on!

981
01:26:54,293 --> 01:26:58,087
All right, Lil, what is it
you're up to? Out with it.

982
01:26:58,171 --> 01:27:01,966
Me? I'm just offering
you my services.

983
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:05,303
Guerrilla fighter, perjurer,
intelligence agent.

984
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:07,972
All right, intelligence agent.

985
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:13,227
Baltimore. There's a mother
in Baltimore. Marnie made
a phone call this morning.

986
01:27:13,312 --> 01:27:16,314
She said she hadn't
been able to write
because she'd had the flu.

987
01:27:16,398 --> 01:27:18,399
She didn't know when she'd
be able to get to Baltimore

988
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:20,776
but that she'd send
money this week.

989
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:24,864
She said to go on writing
to her at the same
post office box.

990
01:27:27,034 --> 01:27:29,702
I listened through
the library door.

991
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:35,041
She's having you on, Lil.
It's some sort of gag.

992
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:38,711
You've been ratty.
She's set out to
teach you some manners.

993
01:27:38,837 --> 01:27:41,631
You're being had, Lil.
You can say that again!

994
01:27:41,715 --> 01:27:45,593
But I don't want to say it
again. I don't want to
have to say it again.

995
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:47,345
All right, Mark.

996
01:27:48,847 --> 01:27:50,723
You seem to be
growing up, Lil.

997
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:53,768
I expect what we should do
is find you some young man.

998
01:27:53,852 --> 01:27:57,730
What's your type?
I was waiting for you.

999
01:27:57,856 --> 01:27:59,982
I'm queer for liars.

1000
01:28:00,067 --> 01:28:04,654
Really? Well, what sort
of liar do you fancy?
We could run an ad.

1001
01:28:04,738 --> 01:28:06,989
Would you prefer
an indoor liar
or an outdoor liar?

1002
01:28:07,074 --> 01:28:09,283
Playboy or Field & Stream?

1003
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:21,379
Anybody home?

1004
01:28:22,214 --> 01:28:23,798
Hi! Where's Marnie?

1005
01:28:23,882 --> 01:28:27,551
She and Dad are still
out riding. He's taking
her over the hunt country.

1006
01:28:27,636 --> 01:28:30,304
Big deal. She's going
to ride with the hunt.

1007
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:32,807
And Dad's throwing
some kind of bash
to introduce her.

1008
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:36,227
Oh. I was expecting
a long-distance call.
Has it come in?

1009
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:38,646
No. Not that I know of.

1010
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:40,231
I'll get it.

1011
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:47,238
Hello? Yes.
Now hold on, I want to
take it on another phone.

1012
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:51,909
I'll take it upstairs.
Hang up as soon as I get it.

1013
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:57,164
Uh, Lil, you will hang up,
won't you?

1014
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:20,521
Okay, Lil.

1015
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,983
Hello? Yes,
I'll talk to him now.

1016
01:29:24,526 --> 01:29:27,611
Hello, Mr. Boyle.
You've found anything
interesting down there?

1017
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:30,656
Hold on. Let me get a pencil.
Okay, ready.

1018
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:35,119
Bernice Edgar.

1019
01:29:35,829 --> 01:29:42,251
116 Van Buren Street,
Baltimore.

1020
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:44,462
Yeah, I got that. Go on.

1021
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:51,052
Wait a minute.
You say she killed him?

1022
01:29:52,179 --> 01:29:54,013
Well, when was that?

1023
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:58,434
That means the little girl
must have been about five,
is that right?

1024
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:01,353
Well, what happened to her?
No, not the woman. The child.

1025
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:05,483
I want to know what happened
to the little girl,
the daughter.

1026
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:10,654
No, no. Stay on there.
Get me anything else you can.

1027
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:13,240
Look, have photostats made
of all the court records.

1028
01:30:13,325 --> 01:30:16,952
Send them to me immediately.
Yes, to my office. Registered.

1029
01:30:17,037 --> 01:30:19,163
You're doing
an excellent job, Mr. Boyle.

1030
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:22,249
Marnie, did you have a good ride?

1031
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:25,461
Yeah. Mr. Boyle,
get the photostats to me. Yes.

1032
01:30:25,545 --> 01:30:29,548
And call me the minute
you get anything
further on the child.

1033
01:30:30,092 --> 01:30:33,427
Thank you. I'll expect
to hear from you. Goodbye.

1034
01:30:49,236 --> 01:30:50,903
Mama?

1035
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:56,075
Oh, Mama, don't cry.
Please don't cry, Mama.

1036
01:30:58,203 --> 01:31:00,704
No! No!

1037
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:03,541
Mama?

1038
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,710
Mama, don't cry.

1039
01:31:08,797 --> 01:31:09,922
No!

1040
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:15,886
Mama?

1041
01:31:17,931 --> 01:31:19,306
Mama?

1042
01:31:20,559 --> 01:31:22,601
Mama?
Wake up, Marnie.

1043
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:24,395
Mama?
Marnie?

1044
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:27,815
Mama?

1045
01:31:29,067 --> 01:31:31,026
Oh, don't hurt my mama.

1046
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:33,737
Marnie.
Please don't hurt my mama!

1047
01:31:41,121 --> 01:31:42,872
Marnie.

1048
01:31:42,956 --> 01:31:44,456
No, don't, don't!

1049
01:31:46,793 --> 01:31:48,377
What's going on?

1050
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:50,087
She's having a nightmare.
No.

1051
01:31:50,589 --> 01:31:51,922
No, Mama.
Come on, Marnie.

1052
01:31:52,007 --> 01:31:53,215
Mama?
Wake up. Wake up.

1053
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:55,676
It's just a nightmare.
Come on.

1054
01:32:00,098 --> 01:32:02,933
She's all right.
I'm cold.

1055
01:32:05,478 --> 01:32:09,190
That's supposed to
be your department,
isn't it, old boy?

1056
01:32:09,441 --> 01:32:11,150
Good night, all.

1057
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:29,835
Let me get you a brandy.
Uh-uh.

1058
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:34,298
Where did you
get these things?

1059
01:32:36,051 --> 01:32:38,636
I can get more any
time I want them.

1060
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:40,387
Yeah, of course you can.

1061
01:32:40,472 --> 01:32:45,517
You can also find, at your
convenience, heights, ropes,
ovens, even plastic bags.

1062
01:32:45,644 --> 01:32:48,145
The world's full
of alternatives.

1063
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:51,148
I'd like to go
back to sleep now.

1064
01:32:51,233 --> 01:32:55,402
Why? Your sleep seems
even less agreeable
than your waking hours.

1065
01:32:56,738 --> 01:33:01,575
That, uh, dream. You know,
you've had it before.

1066
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:05,412
Is it about something
that really happened to you?

1067
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:09,250
No, I don't know
what it means. Nothing.

1068
01:33:10,252 --> 01:33:13,837
Well, it's about your mother.
She wants you to get up.

1069
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:17,716
Yes, but first there
are the three taps.

1070
01:33:20,053 --> 01:33:24,014
And then she says,
"Get up, Marnie.
You have to get up now!"

1071
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:26,725
But I don't want to. If I...

1072
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:30,854
If I get up, I'll be
cold and they'll hurt her.

1073
01:33:31,231 --> 01:33:33,524
Who? Who'll hurt her?

1074
01:33:33,692 --> 01:33:39,488
The... The... Them!
I don't know. I don't know.

1075
01:33:39,572 --> 01:33:43,409
But I hear the noises.
I'm cold and I hear
the noises!

1076
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:45,953
What noises?
What are they like?

1077
01:33:52,127 --> 01:33:53,752
Who makes them?

1078
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:03,387
You Freud, me Jane?

1079
01:34:07,559 --> 01:34:12,354
If you won't see an analyst,
why don't you try
to help yourself?

1080
01:34:12,439 --> 01:34:16,567
But that's why
I'm in this trap,
is from trying to help myself.

1081
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:18,986
Just leave me alone,
Mark, please.

1082
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:22,156
If I give you some books,
will you read them?

1083
01:34:22,407 --> 01:34:25,117
Your new homework?
Frigidity In Women?

1084
01:34:25,201 --> 01:34:27,911
The Psychopathic
Delinquent and Criminal?

1085
01:34:28,246 --> 01:34:31,623
Have you read them?
I don't need to read that muck

1086
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:36,253
to know that women
are stupid and feeble
and that men are filthy pigs.

1087
01:34:39,424 --> 01:34:42,634
In case you
didn't recognize it,
that was a rejection.

1088
01:34:43,928 --> 01:34:47,765
I want you to
read them. Start with
The Undiscovered Self.

1089
01:34:47,849 --> 01:34:51,435
Oh, for God's sake, Mark,
leave me alone! I'm tired!

1090
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:57,566
Why can't you just
leave me alone?

1091
01:34:57,650 --> 01:35:00,486
Because I think
you're sick, old dear.

1092
01:35:01,613 --> 01:35:02,946
I'm sick?

1093
01:35:04,449 --> 01:35:07,368
Well, take a look
at yourself, old dear.

1094
01:35:07,786 --> 01:35:11,622
You're so hot to play
mental health week,
what about you?

1095
01:35:12,165 --> 01:35:16,293
Talk about dream worlds.
You've got a pathological
fix on a woman

1096
01:35:16,378 --> 01:35:21,006
who's not only an admitted
criminal but who screams if
you come near her!

1097
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:27,221
So, what about your dreams,
Daddy dear?

1098
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:30,557
Well, I never said
I was perfect.

1099
01:35:31,142 --> 01:35:33,936
That was quite a speech.
It encourages me to believe

1100
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:36,688
that you have leafed through
one or two books.

1101
01:35:36,815 --> 01:35:39,817
Which one did you find
the most interesting?

1102
01:35:41,486 --> 01:35:44,655
You're really dying
to play doctor, aren't you?

1103
01:35:46,199 --> 01:35:49,660
Okay, I'm a big movie fan.
I know the games.

1104
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:52,496
Come on. Let's play.

1105
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:56,333
Shall I start with dreams
or should we free-associate?

1106
01:35:57,502 --> 01:36:01,338
Oh, Doctor, I'll bet
you're just dying
to free-associate.

1107
01:36:02,674 --> 01:36:05,843
All right now, you give me
a word and I'll give
you an association.

1108
01:36:05,969 --> 01:36:10,222
You know, like, needles,
pins, when a man marries,
trouble begins.

1109
01:36:10,682 --> 01:36:12,141
You ready?

1110
01:36:14,185 --> 01:36:18,689
Well, come on.
I thought you wanted
to play doctor, so let's play.

1111
01:36:19,524 --> 01:36:20,691
Water.

1112
01:36:21,484 --> 01:36:25,696
Bath. Soap. Cleanse. Pure.
Made pure for me.

1113
01:36:26,072 --> 01:36:32,077
"And his tears
shall wash away thy sins
and make thee over again."

1114
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:36,081
Baptists. Mother used
to take me to church
twice on Sundays.

1115
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:40,836
There. I'm not
holding back at all, am I?

1116
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:43,338
You're bringing me
out marvelously, Doctor.

1117
01:36:43,423 --> 01:36:45,883
You'll have me up on my poor
paralyzed little legs

1118
01:36:46,009 --> 01:36:48,093
by the very next scene. Go on.

1119
01:36:49,012 --> 01:36:50,471
Air.

1120
01:36:50,555 --> 01:36:53,390
Stare. And that's what you do.

1121
01:36:56,060 --> 01:37:00,355
You stare and blare and say
you care, but you're unfair,
you want a pair.

1122
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,857
Sex.

1123
01:37:01,941 --> 01:37:04,735
Masculine. Feminine.
Adam and Eve. Jack and Jill.

1124
01:37:04,861 --> 01:37:08,572
I'll slap your filthy face
if you come near
me again, Jack!

1125
01:37:08,698 --> 01:37:10,282
Death.

1126
01:37:10,408 --> 01:37:12,534
Me. Oh, listen, Mark...

1127
01:37:12,619 --> 01:37:13,994
Needles.
Pins.

1128
01:37:14,078 --> 01:37:15,204
Black.
White.

1129
01:37:15,288 --> 01:37:18,790
Red!
White. White! White!

1130
01:37:18,917 --> 01:37:22,794
It's all right, Marnie.
Darling, come here.

1131
01:37:22,921 --> 01:37:25,923
I won't let anything
bad happen to you.
You're all right.

1132
01:37:27,217 --> 01:37:31,261
You're all right.
Oh, help me!

1133
01:37:31,721 --> 01:37:35,265
Help me. Oh, God,
somebody help me.

1134
01:38:25,692 --> 01:38:27,901
What name, sir?
Strutt.

1135
01:38:27,986 --> 01:38:29,861
Mr. and Mrs. Strutt.

1136
01:38:29,988 --> 01:38:31,488
Mr. Strutt.
Yes.

1137
01:38:31,614 --> 01:38:32,948
Mrs. Strutt.
How do you do?

1138
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:34,908
I'm Lil Mainwaring,
Mark's sister-in-law.

1139
01:38:35,034 --> 01:38:38,245
So good of you to
come all this distance.
So nice of you to ask us.

1140
01:38:38,329 --> 01:38:42,541
Wait till tomorrow, Charlie.
Wait till you see
her on a horse, eh?

1141
01:38:45,295 --> 01:38:48,964
I'm not a bit nervous, Mark.
You have no reason to be.

1142
01:38:49,507 --> 01:38:52,426
You're unquestionably
the best-looking woman here.

1143
01:38:52,510 --> 01:38:56,471
The best-dressed,
the most intelligent.
And you're with me.

1144
01:38:57,974 --> 01:39:01,602
I think everyone's here.
Well, Lil's scorekeeper.
She has the list,

1145
01:39:01,686 --> 01:39:03,729
made the table arrangements
and everything.

1146
01:39:03,855 --> 01:39:06,523
I'm afraid I wasn't much help
but I'll do better next time.

1147
01:39:06,649 --> 01:39:11,570
You're doing well enough.
I suppose we should
keep circulating.

1148
01:39:20,204 --> 01:39:21,371
Why?

1149
01:39:22,582 --> 01:39:25,834
Why?
I don't know.
I swear I don't know.

1150
01:39:26,419 --> 01:39:29,338
He wasn't invited here.
He's never been invited here.

1151
01:39:29,422 --> 01:39:32,215
It's Lil.
Lil?

1152
01:39:32,884 --> 01:39:35,719
She doesn't even know Strutt.
It's Lil!

1153
01:39:36,095 --> 01:39:38,305
Get me out of here, please.

1154
01:39:38,389 --> 01:39:40,557
It's too late.
Here they come.

1155
01:39:40,683 --> 01:39:43,518
Look, call his bluff.
I'll back you up.

1156
01:39:44,187 --> 01:39:45,687
Oh, hello, Strutt.
Hello.

1157
01:39:45,772 --> 01:39:47,189
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

1158
01:39:47,273 --> 01:39:49,733
I don't know if
we've met Mrs. Strutt.
I'm Mark Rutland.

1159
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:51,652
How do you do?
And this is my wife.

1160
01:39:51,736 --> 01:39:52,986
How do you do?

1161
01:39:53,071 --> 01:39:56,490
Well, this is a surprise.
I hadn't heard about
your marriage.

1162
01:39:56,574 --> 01:40:00,077
You know, we all think
a great deal of your husband.

1163
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:04,665
We've been doing business
with the Rutlands

1164
01:40:04,749 --> 01:40:06,416
for a long time.

1165
01:40:11,422 --> 01:40:13,590
I believe we've met before.

1166
01:40:14,509 --> 01:40:16,218
I don't think so.

1167
01:40:18,262 --> 01:40:21,682
Think again, Mrs. Rutland.

1168
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:24,351
Are you just recently married?

1169
01:40:24,769 --> 01:40:27,354
Oh, Marnie and I
have been married
for two months.

1170
01:40:27,438 --> 01:40:29,272
But we've known
each other quite well
for about four years.

1171
01:40:29,357 --> 01:40:32,442
Four years? Before Estelle...

1172
01:40:32,777 --> 01:40:34,736
Yes, didn't you know?

1173
01:40:38,116 --> 01:40:40,367
Darling, Betty seems rather
stranded over there.

1174
01:40:40,451 --> 01:40:43,453
You'll have to excuse us
for a few moments, Mrs. Strutt.

1175
01:40:43,579 --> 01:40:46,456
Oh, and Lil,
would you see that
Mr. and Mrs. Strutt's glasses

1176
01:40:46,582 --> 01:40:49,376
are kept brimming?
That's a good girl.

1177
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:52,462
I'm going to be sick.
You're not going to be sick.

1178
01:40:52,547 --> 01:40:54,881
You said we'd known
each other four years.
Lil thought...

1179
01:40:54,966 --> 01:40:58,051
I don't give one
infinitesimal damn
what Lil thought or thinks.

1180
01:40:58,136 --> 01:41:01,138
Dinner is ready, sir.
Good. Announce it.

1181
01:41:02,306 --> 01:41:04,057
Dinner is served.

1182
01:41:07,103 --> 01:41:11,732
Mr. Strutt, my wife's
taken a fancy to you.
Will you see her into dinner?

1183
01:41:22,744 --> 01:41:24,911
Five minutes.
I'm five minutes behind you,

1184
01:41:24,996 --> 01:41:27,330
and in those five minutes
you've got yourself
up like a cat burglar

1185
01:41:27,415 --> 01:41:28,999
and packed for a world cruise.

1186
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:31,168
I've got to get out of here,
and you've got to let me go.

1187
01:41:31,252 --> 01:41:33,336
That man is going
to send me to jail.
You know he is!

1188
01:41:33,463 --> 01:41:35,589
Oh, what are you using
for guts this season, Marnie?

1189
01:41:35,673 --> 01:41:36,840
Don't you understand?

1190
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:39,426
He's coming back here tomorrow
and he's coming for my head!

1191
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:41,428
Well, darling,
we just won't give it to him.

1192
01:41:41,512 --> 01:41:44,514
Strutt may be throbbing away
out there in the night with
vengeful fantasies,

1193
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:46,016
but the fact is
he's a businessman.

1194
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:47,851
That means he's
in the business
of doing business.

1195
01:41:47,935 --> 01:41:50,353
So?
So we try to do business.

1196
01:41:50,438 --> 01:41:52,272
The Rutland account is one
of the biggest he's got.

1197
01:41:52,356 --> 01:41:55,192
And if he insists on acting
like the little
swine he is, then...

1198
01:41:55,318 --> 01:41:57,110
And he'll lose others,
too, I'll see to it.

1199
01:41:57,195 --> 01:41:59,696
But first I'll see to it
that he understands
that I'll see to it.

1200
01:41:59,781 --> 01:42:01,364
Suppose you can keep him
from prosecuting,

1201
01:42:01,491 --> 01:42:02,866
you can't keep
him from talking.

1202
01:42:02,992 --> 01:42:05,619
I don't care if he outtalks
every Southern senator
on Capitol Hill.

1203
01:42:05,703 --> 01:42:07,287
Well, I do. I care.

1204
01:42:07,371 --> 01:42:10,957
Darling, didn't your
mother ever tell you
about sticks and stones?

1205
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:14,294
Can't you understand,
there may be other
things involved,

1206
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:17,047
other people
that I don't want
to hear about me?

1207
01:42:17,173 --> 01:42:18,423
Yes, I can understand,

1208
01:42:18,549 --> 01:42:22,719
but since you're
the well-known, friendless
orphan child, who's to care?

1209
01:42:22,804 --> 01:42:24,054
The police, damn you.

1210
01:42:24,138 --> 01:42:26,890
Now what can the police
do if we can stop
Strutt from prosecuting?

1211
01:42:26,974 --> 01:42:30,894
They can start
investigating other jobs.
Other similar jobs.

1212
01:42:35,566 --> 01:42:39,402
Well, that's something
else again.
Yes, it is.

1213
01:42:39,487 --> 01:42:41,863
How many? How many other jobs?

1214
01:42:44,408 --> 01:42:47,244
Well, tell me the truth,
damn it. You've nothing to
gain by lying to me now.

1215
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:50,163
How many jobs have you pulled?
Three.

1216
01:42:51,374 --> 01:42:53,250
Try again.

1217
01:42:53,334 --> 01:42:56,002
Four. Five counting Strutt.

1218
01:42:56,087 --> 01:42:58,255
Over how long a period?

1219
01:42:58,381 --> 01:43:01,091
Five years, and that's
the truth, I swear it!

1220
01:43:01,425 --> 01:43:02,926
All right. How much?

1221
01:43:03,052 --> 01:43:06,596
How much all together?
Under $50,000.

1222
01:43:06,681 --> 01:43:08,181
In what towns?

1223
01:43:08,266 --> 01:43:11,852
Buffalo, Detroit, Elizabeth,
New Jersey and New York.

1224
01:43:12,353 --> 01:43:14,271
Well, in New York
and Philadelphia,

1225
01:43:14,355 --> 01:43:17,440
I'll be poor old Mark Rutland
who lost his head
over a pretty girl.

1226
01:43:17,567 --> 01:43:19,609
And in the others,
I'm just an accessory
after the fact

1227
01:43:19,694 --> 01:43:22,445
and equally
liable under the law.
Well, then let me go.

1228
01:43:22,572 --> 01:43:24,614
They can't blame you
because you didn't know.

1229
01:43:24,699 --> 01:43:27,534
After you found out,
I ran away. Just let me go!

1230
01:43:27,618 --> 01:43:29,619
If I let you run out now,
nothing could keep
the lid on it.

1231
01:43:29,745 --> 01:43:33,373
They've got your real name.
They'll work up
a complete dossier on you.

1232
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:35,375
When they finally catch you,
and they will
catch you, Marnie,

1233
01:43:35,459 --> 01:43:38,128
they'll throw the New York
City Library at you.

1234
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:41,089
But suppose we
don't lose our heads?

1235
01:43:41,173 --> 01:43:45,343
All we've got to fight
is Strutt's big mouth.
At least that gives us time.

1236
01:43:45,428 --> 01:43:47,596
Sit down. Listen.

1237
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:49,598
Now, we can do one
of two things.

1238
01:43:49,682 --> 01:43:52,183
We can hire a lawyer
and a psychiatrist,

1239
01:43:52,268 --> 01:43:54,436
and make an immediate
voluntary confession

1240
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:57,397
and an offer of restitution.
That'll make the whole
thing public.

1241
01:43:57,481 --> 01:44:02,319
But the chances
are very good that you'll
get a suspended sentence.

1242
01:44:02,403 --> 01:44:03,862
Now the alternative.

1243
01:44:03,946 --> 01:44:07,949
We can go together and make
private calls on all
the places you've robbed.

1244
01:44:08,034 --> 01:44:13,538
You'll express deep
sorrow and repentance,
sincere and vocal contrition.

1245
01:44:13,623 --> 01:44:16,291
And while you sob,
I show a check
for the amount stolen

1246
01:44:16,375 --> 01:44:19,085
and press it into
their hot little hands

1247
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:22,130
and ask as a special favor
to a distraught husband,

1248
01:44:22,214 --> 01:44:24,049
to withdraw the charge.

1249
01:44:24,133 --> 01:44:26,009
But if one of them says,
"Thanks, I'll take
the money back

1250
01:44:26,093 --> 01:44:28,261
"but I won't drop the charge."
Then we've had it.

1251
01:44:28,346 --> 01:44:32,474
After that it's an open
court case, and a very
probable sentence.

1252
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:38,480
On the other hand,
with a bit of luck,
we might pull it off.

1253
01:44:38,564 --> 01:44:40,148
Think it over.

1254
01:44:41,150 --> 01:44:43,735
It's late. You better
get some sleep now.
You got to be up for the hunt.

1255
01:44:43,819 --> 01:44:46,071
You don't expect me
to ride in the hunt.

1256
01:44:46,155 --> 01:44:48,281
Certainly I expect
you to ride.

1257
01:44:48,366 --> 01:44:50,867
For one thing, I want you
out of the house when
Strutt comes here.

1258
01:44:50,952 --> 01:44:52,786
And for another,
I don't want to give
Lil the satisfaction

1259
01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:54,913
of seeing you chicken.

1260
01:44:54,997 --> 01:44:57,916
And, Marnie,
tonight the door stays open.

1261
01:47:56,679 --> 01:47:57,929
Forio!

1262
01:48:21,287 --> 01:48:25,331
A gun! Give me a gun!
My horse is screaming!

1263
01:48:25,416 --> 01:48:28,877
Get me a gun!
You want to shoot your horse?

1264
01:48:28,961 --> 01:48:31,462
Hey, wait a minute!

1265
01:48:31,547 --> 01:48:33,631
I can't give you a gun,

1266
01:48:33,716 --> 01:48:36,467
my mister isn't home.
I don't know what he'd...

1267
01:48:36,552 --> 01:48:38,595
You must be crazy!

1268
01:48:38,679 --> 01:48:40,471
Mrs. Turpin!

1269
01:48:41,390 --> 01:48:43,141
Miss Mainwaring,

1270
01:48:43,225 --> 01:48:46,186
this woman comes
tearing in here
demanding I give her a gun.

1271
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:49,439
Tell this fool to give
me a gun. Forio's hurt!

1272
01:48:49,565 --> 01:48:53,318
Marnie, wait.
I'll call a vet.
There's nothing a vet can do.

1273
01:48:53,402 --> 01:48:55,862
We don't have a phone anyway,
Miss Mainwaring.

1274
01:48:55,946 --> 01:48:58,990
If the horse is hurt bad,
I could give
her Jack's pistol.

1275
01:48:59,074 --> 01:49:02,035
Hurry. Oh, hurry,
please. He's suffering.

1276
01:49:02,119 --> 01:49:03,953
Go get the gun!

1277
01:49:04,038 --> 01:49:06,623
I'll do it, Marnie.
You wait here.

1278
01:49:06,707 --> 01:49:09,500
Are you still in
the mood for killing?

1279
01:49:11,712 --> 01:49:13,087
Please, Marnie!

1280
01:49:13,172 --> 01:49:15,006
Stay out of my way!

1281
01:49:19,887 --> 01:49:21,930
Marnie, please!

1282
01:49:22,014 --> 01:49:25,225
If you don't want me to do it,
then let me go back
for one of the men.

1283
01:49:43,619 --> 01:49:47,455
There. There now.

1284
01:49:54,171 --> 01:49:56,339
So you can see, Mr. Strutt,

1285
01:49:56,423 --> 01:50:01,678
how very disadvantageous
any action on your part
would be for everyone.

1286
01:50:03,639 --> 01:50:08,726
For me, certainly.
For a sick girl, and for you.

1287
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:12,814
Yes, I'm sure
that's the fashionable
attitude, Mr. Rutland.

1288
01:50:12,898 --> 01:50:15,942
But just wait until
you've been victimized.

1289
01:50:23,534 --> 01:50:27,870
Try to look at the situation from
a business point of view.

1290
01:50:27,955 --> 01:50:29,539
Yes.

1291
01:50:29,623 --> 01:50:34,419
We've been business friends for
a number of years now.

1292
01:51:38,317 --> 01:51:42,904
-I want you to apply them all for my benefit.
-Hmm.

1293
01:51:46,992 --> 01:51:49,827
Oh, sorry.

1294
01:51:51,538 --> 01:51:53,206
Hello?

1295
01:51:53,665 --> 01:51:55,583
Yes, Lil, what is it?

1296
01:51:59,713 --> 01:52:02,465
Yes, I understand.
I'm hanging up now.

1297
01:52:02,549 --> 01:52:06,386
You'll have to forgive me,
Strutt, I've had a bit of
trouble at the hunt.

1298
01:52:06,470 --> 01:52:10,473
I'll talk to you again,
possibly tomorrow. I'm sorry
to have to run out like this.

1299
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:43,649
I'll take you home, Marnie.

1300
01:53:49,948 --> 01:53:51,699
It's all right, darling.

1301
01:53:57,664 --> 01:54:00,583
You're just exhausted.
Now, don't panic.

1302
01:54:04,004 --> 01:54:07,131
I've spoken to Strutt.
I think I'll be able
to talk him around.

1303
01:54:16,934 --> 01:54:19,018
I'll just put this away.

1304
01:54:46,171 --> 01:54:48,214
Go on. You want the money.

1305
01:54:48,298 --> 01:54:51,008
You wanted the money,
or you wouldn't have
taken my keys, would you?

1306
01:54:51,093 --> 01:54:53,219
You took the keys,
now take the money!

1307
01:54:53,303 --> 01:54:54,929
I said take it!

1308
01:55:00,143 --> 01:55:05,398
What's mine belongs
to you. It's yours.
You're not stealing.

1309
01:55:05,482 --> 01:55:08,609
You want the money,
take it. I said take it!

1310
01:55:27,546 --> 01:55:32,466
Marnie, now we're going
to Baltimore to see
your mother.

1311
01:55:32,551 --> 01:55:33,926
No!
Yes.

1312
01:55:49,276 --> 01:55:50,610
Come on.

1313
01:55:56,908 --> 01:56:00,578
So, I knew you'd run away
and you'd want money.

1314
01:56:00,662 --> 01:56:05,166
It didn't take me a minute
to find out the office
drawer key was gone.

1315
01:56:05,626 --> 01:56:09,337
If you tell my mother
about me, I'll kill you.

1316
01:56:11,173 --> 01:56:15,968
If you mean about the
robberies, I've no intention
of telling her anything.

1317
01:56:16,637 --> 01:56:19,847
It's your mother who's going
to do the talking.

1318
01:56:29,066 --> 01:56:30,733
Marnie, come on.

1319
01:56:32,069 --> 01:56:33,611
No!
Come on.

1320
01:56:52,422 --> 01:56:55,132
-It's all right, Marnie. You're inside.
-What in the wide world?

1321
01:56:55,217 --> 01:56:57,551
I'm sorry to crash in
on you like this, Mrs. Edgar.

1322
01:56:57,636 --> 01:57:01,180
I guess you know how
Marnie feels about storms.

1323
01:57:01,306 --> 01:57:04,350
Marnie, stop acting
like such a ninny.
Pardon me.

1324
01:57:04,434 --> 01:57:07,812
Who are you, mister?
You're not Mr. Pendleton.

1325
01:57:07,896 --> 01:57:10,106
No, I'm not.
Who's Mr. Pendleton?

1326
01:57:10,190 --> 01:57:12,733
Then what have you got to do
with my Marnie?

1327
01:57:12,818 --> 01:57:15,861
Well, I'm Mark Rutland,
Marnie's husband, Mrs. Edgar.

1328
01:57:15,946 --> 01:57:17,446
Marnie hasn't been very well.

1329
01:57:17,531 --> 01:57:20,408
I don't believe
she's been very well
since you had your accident.

1330
01:57:20,492 --> 01:57:21,534
My what?

1331
01:57:21,618 --> 01:57:24,036
I think you've always
called it "your accident."

1332
01:57:24,121 --> 01:57:26,747
What do you think
you're talking about?

1333
01:57:26,832 --> 01:57:30,626
Coming into my
house like this,
talking about my accident!

1334
01:57:31,795 --> 01:57:34,588
You're not married to Marnie.
I don't believe you.

1335
01:57:34,673 --> 01:57:37,883
Marnie? Your daughter
needs help, Mrs. Edgar.

1336
01:57:37,968 --> 01:57:39,677
You've got to
tell her the truth.

1337
01:57:39,761 --> 01:57:42,346
She has no memory of
what happened that night.

1338
01:57:42,431 --> 01:57:46,809
And she needs to
remember everything.
You must help her.

1339
01:57:46,893 --> 01:57:49,729
Mister, you must be
plumb crazy.

1340
01:57:50,313 --> 01:57:51,731
If you won't tell her, I will.

1341
01:57:51,815 --> 01:57:54,358
I know everything that
happened, and I'll tell
her the whole story.

1342
01:57:54,443 --> 01:57:55,651
Oh, no you won't, mister,

1343
01:57:55,736 --> 01:58:00,030
because you don't
know the whole story,
and nobody does but me!

1344
01:58:00,657 --> 01:58:04,410
Oh. Well, since you're so very
knowledgeable, Mrs. Edgar,

1345
01:58:04,494 --> 01:58:07,538
do you also know that
your daughter, your
beautiful, young daughter,

1346
01:58:07,622 --> 01:58:11,250
cannot stand to have a man
touch her? Any man?

1347
01:58:11,334 --> 01:58:13,544
She doesn't know why,
but you do.

1348
01:58:13,628 --> 01:58:16,130
Don't you think
you owe it to her
to help her to understand

1349
01:58:16,214 --> 01:58:17,673
what happened to
make her like this?

1350
01:58:17,758 --> 01:58:19,008
What matters what made her?

1351
01:58:19,092 --> 01:58:22,845
She's lucky. She's lucky
to feel like that.
Just plain lucky!

1352
01:58:24,139 --> 01:58:28,851
That's very interesting,
Mrs. Edgar. But I've had
an investigator working here.

1353
01:58:28,935 --> 01:58:31,353
I've read the transcript. Hmm?

1354
01:58:31,730 --> 01:58:34,106
The records of
your trial for murder.

1355
01:58:34,191 --> 01:58:36,108
In the records it
states quite plainly

1356
01:58:36,193 --> 01:58:39,111
that you made your living
from the touch of men.

1357
01:58:39,237 --> 01:58:43,532
And it was one of your clients
that you killed that night.

1358
01:58:44,034 --> 01:58:45,534
Oh, God!

1359
01:58:46,620 --> 01:58:48,829
Was there also
a storm that night,
Mrs. Edgar?

1360
01:58:48,914 --> 01:58:51,207
Is that why Marnie's
terrified of storms?

1361
01:58:51,333 --> 01:58:53,584
Was there thunder and
lightning that night?

1362
01:58:53,668 --> 01:58:56,003
Did the storms terrify
your little girl, hmm?

1363
01:58:56,087 --> 01:58:58,130
In addition to everything else
that happened?

1364
01:58:58,215 --> 01:59:02,510
Get out of my house.
You get out!

1365
01:59:03,428 --> 01:59:07,723
I don't need any filthy man
coming in my house no more!

1366
01:59:07,808 --> 01:59:10,768
Do you hear me? You get out!

1367
01:59:10,852 --> 01:59:15,523
You get out
of my house! You get out!

1368
01:59:16,691 --> 01:59:18,818
You let my mama go!

1369
01:59:18,902 --> 01:59:22,947
You hear? You let my mama go!

1370
01:59:23,031 --> 01:59:25,449
You're hurting my mama!

1371
01:59:25,534 --> 01:59:27,284
Who am I, Marnie?

1372
01:59:27,369 --> 01:59:31,664
Why should I want
to hurt your mama?
You're one of them.

1373
01:59:34,125 --> 01:59:35,918
One of them in
the white suits.

1374
01:59:36,002 --> 01:59:37,878
Shut up, Marnie!
No!

1375
01:59:37,963 --> 01:59:42,675
Remember, Marnie.
Tell us how it all was.

1376
01:59:42,759 --> 01:59:44,927
The white suits, remember?

1377
01:59:52,519 --> 01:59:56,105
What does
the tapping mean, Marnie?
Why does it make you cry?

1378
01:59:56,189 --> 01:59:59,733
It means they want in.

1379
02:00:01,194 --> 02:00:03,445
Them in their white suits.

1380
02:00:04,739 --> 02:00:07,491
Mama comes and
gets me out of bed.

1381
02:00:08,952 --> 02:00:11,370
I don't like to
get out of bed.

1382
02:00:30,098 --> 02:00:31,765
Come on, Marnie.

1383
02:00:33,685 --> 02:00:35,477
Get up. All right?

1384
02:00:37,105 --> 02:00:38,522
Good girl.

1385
02:00:40,275 --> 02:00:42,026
That's my baby.

1386
02:00:43,528 --> 02:00:44,778
There.

1387
02:00:48,742 --> 02:00:50,743
There. Mmm.

1388
02:00:51,494 --> 02:00:54,622
You go on back
to sleep, sugarpop.
Bernice.

1389
02:01:10,221 --> 02:01:14,183
Now, you ain't afraid
of a little bit of
lightning, are you? Huh?

1390
02:01:18,813 --> 02:01:20,439
What happens next, Marnie?

1391
02:01:20,523 --> 02:01:25,486
He came out to me.

1392
02:01:28,031 --> 02:01:31,992
Oh, I don't like him.
He smells funny.

1393
02:01:32,202 --> 02:01:35,663
Your old captain's
gonna be here all
through the night now.

1394
02:01:35,747 --> 02:01:36,830
There's no reason to cry.

1395
02:01:37,374 --> 02:01:39,833
I want my mama!

1396
02:01:39,918 --> 02:01:42,711
I don't want you! Let me go!

1397
02:01:43,129 --> 02:01:44,213
Mama!

1398
02:01:46,883 --> 02:01:50,052
Get your damn
hands off my kid!

1399
02:01:50,136 --> 02:01:53,722
What are you trying to...
What are you...

1400
02:01:57,727 --> 02:01:58,894
Mama?

1401
02:01:59,896 --> 02:02:01,730
Make him go, Mama.

1402
02:02:03,942 --> 02:02:07,152
I don't like him to kiss me.
Make him go, Mama!

1403
02:02:09,572 --> 02:02:11,448
Get your hands...

1404
02:02:11,574 --> 02:02:14,243
Get your hands...
There's nothing the matter

1405
02:02:14,327 --> 02:02:16,996
with my hands!
...off my Marnie!

1406
02:02:18,289 --> 02:02:20,290
What is it, Marnie?
What's the matter?

1407
02:02:20,417 --> 02:02:22,418
He hit my mama!

1408
02:02:22,502 --> 02:02:24,086
No!
What's the matter with you?

1409
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:26,005
No!
You crazy or drunk?

1410
02:02:26,089 --> 02:02:30,134
Now, don't go hitting me.
You're gonna get
hit yourself, girl.

1411
02:02:36,266 --> 02:02:38,308
Oh, my leg!

1412
02:02:38,852 --> 02:02:41,103
Mama?
Is your mother hurt?

1413
02:02:41,187 --> 02:02:44,773
How? How is she hurt?
He fell on her.

1414
02:02:46,026 --> 02:02:48,819
Oh, she's so hurt. Oh, Mama.

1415
02:02:48,945 --> 02:02:52,364
Marnie. Marnie, help me!

1416
02:02:56,119 --> 02:02:57,661
I got to help my mama!

1417
02:03:04,294 --> 02:03:05,544
Marnie?

1418
02:03:07,505 --> 02:03:08,964
I hit him!

1419
02:03:10,216 --> 02:03:12,468
I hit him with a stick. I...

1420
02:03:13,219 --> 02:03:14,344
I hurt him!

1421
02:03:22,479 --> 02:03:26,148
There. There now.

1422
02:03:41,956 --> 02:03:43,707
You're all right now, darling.

1423
02:03:44,167 --> 02:03:47,169
You're all right.
It's all over.

1424
02:03:48,546 --> 02:03:50,172
You're all right.

1425
02:04:13,863 --> 02:04:16,532
I thought when
she lost her memory
of that night,

1426
02:04:16,616 --> 02:04:19,409
it was a sign of
God's forgiveness.

1427
02:04:19,536 --> 02:04:23,038
I thought I was being
given another chance

1428
02:04:23,123 --> 02:04:28,043
to change everything,
to make it all up to her.

1429
02:04:29,129 --> 02:04:32,548
I'm sorry, Mrs. Edgar.
Truly sorry.

1430
02:04:34,592 --> 02:04:38,929
Your mother told the police
that she'd killed the sailor
in self-defense.

1431
02:04:39,055 --> 02:04:42,432
They could see
how bad hurt I was.
They believed me.

1432
02:04:42,809 --> 02:04:45,394
And I never told
anyone the truth.

1433
02:04:47,230 --> 02:04:49,148
Never.

1434
02:04:49,232 --> 02:04:52,901
Not even when they tried
to take you away
from me, Marnie.

1435
02:04:52,986 --> 02:04:54,570
Not even then.

1436
02:04:56,406 --> 02:05:00,909
You must've loved me, Mama.
You must've loved me.

1437
02:05:03,997 --> 02:05:07,499
You're the only
thing in this world
I ever did love.

1438
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:18,260
It was just that I
was so young, Marnie.

1439
02:05:19,929 --> 02:05:22,306
I never had
anything of my own.

1440
02:05:28,688 --> 02:05:31,106
You know how I
got you, Marnie?

1441
02:05:36,279 --> 02:05:39,531
There was this boy, Billy.

1442
02:05:41,534 --> 02:05:44,620
And I wanted Billy's
basketball sweater.

1443
02:05:46,998 --> 02:05:48,373
I was 15.

1444
02:05:51,294 --> 02:05:55,631
And Billy said if I let him,
I could have the sweater.

1445
02:05:58,384 --> 02:05:59,968
So I let him.

1446
02:06:04,307 --> 02:06:08,227
And then later on
when you got started,
he run away.

1447
02:06:11,814 --> 02:06:14,149
I still got that old sweater.

1448
02:06:17,028 --> 02:06:18,987
And I got you, Marnie.

1449
02:06:21,991 --> 02:06:26,787
And after the accident,
when I was in the hospital,

1450
02:06:26,871 --> 02:06:30,249
they tried to make
me let you be adopted.

1451
02:06:30,375 --> 02:06:33,377
But I wouldn't. I wanted you.

1452
02:06:34,587 --> 02:06:36,964
And I promised God right then,

1453
02:06:37,048 --> 02:06:41,510
if he'd let me keep you,
and you not remember,

1454
02:06:41,844 --> 02:06:44,680
I'd bring you up
different from me.

1455
02:06:45,515 --> 02:06:48,725
Decent.
Decent?

1456
02:06:50,895 --> 02:06:52,271
Oh, Mama!

1457
02:06:55,441 --> 02:06:58,277
Well, you surely
realized your ambition.

1458
02:06:58,695 --> 02:07:01,113
I certainly am decent.

1459
02:07:02,865 --> 02:07:06,868
Of course, I'm a cheat
and a liar and a thief,

1460
02:07:09,956 --> 02:07:11,707
but I am decent.

1461
02:07:13,710 --> 02:07:18,380
Marnie, it's time
to have a little
compassion for yourself.

1462
02:07:19,757 --> 02:07:25,220
When a child, a child
of any age, Marnie,
can't get love,

1463
02:07:25,722 --> 02:07:29,266
it takes what it can get,
any way it can get it.

1464
02:07:29,726 --> 02:07:32,144
It's not so
hard to understand.

1465
02:07:46,117 --> 02:07:48,910
Get up, Marnie,
you're aching my leg.

1466
02:08:06,763 --> 02:08:09,598
There. That's better.

1467
02:08:12,143 --> 02:08:13,352
Mark?

1468
02:08:16,481 --> 02:08:18,523
What am I going to do?

1469
02:08:19,609 --> 02:08:21,610
What's going to happen?

1470
02:08:21,986 --> 02:08:24,196
What do you want to happen?

1471
02:08:26,199 --> 02:08:27,616
I guess I...

1472
02:08:28,951 --> 02:08:31,286
I want it all cleared up.

1473
02:08:31,371 --> 02:08:35,540
Will I... Will I go to jail?

1474
02:08:37,126 --> 02:08:39,961
No. Not after what
I have to tell them.

1475
02:08:47,470 --> 02:08:49,012
We'll go now.

1476
02:08:56,813 --> 02:09:01,400
Mrs. Edgar,
I'll bring Marnie back.
She's very tired now.

1477
02:09:04,153 --> 02:09:05,737
Goodbye, Mama.

1478
02:09:08,157 --> 02:09:09,491
Goodbye.

1479
02:09:16,332 --> 02:09:18,083
Goodbye, sugarpop.

1480
02:09:32,265 --> 02:09:36,435
Oh, Mark, I don't want
to go to jail.

1481
02:09:37,353 --> 02:09:40,439
I'd rather stay with you.
Had you, love?

1482
02:09:42,066 --> 02:09:44,901
Send for
the doctor over the hill.

1483
02:09:45,027 --> 02:09:48,029
Call for the doctor.
Call for the nurse.

1484
02:09:48,114 --> 02:09:51,116
Call for the lady
with the alligator purse.
