1
00:02:23,512 --> 00:02:26,549
Robbed! Cleaned out!

2
00:02:26,712 --> 00:02:29,590
Nine thousand nine hundred
and sixty-seven dollars.

3
00:02:29,752 --> 00:02:31,151
Precisely as I told you
over the telephone.

4
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:34,869
And that girl did it. Marion Holland!

5
00:02:35,032 --> 00:02:37,182
That's the girl. Marion Holland!

6
00:02:37,352 --> 00:02:41,503
- Can you describe her, Mr Strutt?
- Certainly I can.

7
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:45,301
Five feet five.
A hundred and ten pounds.

8
00:02:46,392 --> 00:02:47,711
Size eight dress.

9
00:02:48,592 --> 00:02:52,903
Blue eyes. Black, wavy hair.

10
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:56,710
Even features. Good teeth.

11
00:02:56,872 --> 00:02:58,863
- (Chuckling)
- What's so damn funny?

12
00:02:59,032 --> 00:03:01,545
There 's been a grand larceny
committed on these premises!

13
00:03:01,711 --> 00:03:05,022
Yes, sir. You were saying,
ah, black hair,

14
00:03:05,191 --> 00:03:08,501
wavy, even features, good teeth.

15
00:03:08,671 --> 00:03:11,264
- She was in your employ 4 months?
- Mmm.

16
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,260
What were her references, sir?

17
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,264
Well, as a matter of fact -

18
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,990
Yes, uh,
she had references, I 'm sure.

19
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,584
Oh, Mr Strutt, don't you remember?

20
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,060
She didn't have any references at all.

21
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,218
Well, she worked the
copying and adding machines.

22
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:32,857
No confidential duties.

23
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,989
(Strutt) Mr Rutland.
I didn't know you were in town.

24
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,983
Just had a robbery. Almost $1 0,000.

25
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,222
So I gathered. By a pretty girl
with no references.

26
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,939
You remember her. I pointed her out to
you last time you were here.

27
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:52,148
You said something about how I was
improving the looks of the place.

28
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:56,019
Oh, that one!
The brunette with the legs.

29
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,785
Excuse me. Mr Rutland's a client.

30
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,908
I don't think you've got time
to discuss business today, Mr Strutt,

31
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,025
what with your crime wave
on your hands.

32
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:08,704
Oh, no, no. Always time for
Rutland business. You know that.

33
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:11,100
How are things in Philadelphia?

34
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,581
The little witch! I'll have her
put away for 20 years!

35
00:04:15,749 --> 00:04:18,025
I knew she was too good to be true.

36
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,307
Always so eager to work
overtime, never made a mistake.

37
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:24,903
Always pulling her skirt
down over her knees

38
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:28,504
as though they were
a national treasure.

39
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,863
She seemed so nice, so efficient.

40
00:04:31,028 --> 00:04:34,145
- So -
- Resourceful?

41

Hello, Mrs Maitland.

48
00:07:14,145 --> 00:07:17,374
Oh, so nice to have you back,
Miss Edgar.

49
00:07:17,543 --> 00:07:20,616
- We put you in your same room.
- Thank you, Mrs Maitland.

50
00:07:20,904 --> 00:07:22,815
Can someone drive me over
to Garrod's right away?

51
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:27,852
- Of course. Anytime you're ready.
- Soon as I change.

52
00:07:44,103 --> 00:07:45,741
How do, Miss Edgar?
Good to have you back.

53
00:07:45,903 --> 00:07:47,302
Hello, Mr Garrod.

00:07:47,463 --> 00:07:48,975
Ah, there's my darling!

55
00:07:49,142 --> 00:07:52,533
(Garrod) That big spoiled baby
of yours knew something was up.

56
00:07:52,703 --> 00:07:54,580
Tried to bite me twice
already this morning.

57
00:07:54,743 --> 00:07:58,179
Forio, if you want
to bite somebody, bite me.

58

Thanks.

# Mumps said the doctor.
Measles said the nurse.

64

Oh, it's you. Where's my mother?

68
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,134
She's makin' a pecan pie... for me!

69
00:09:05,981 --> 00:09:08,051
That figures.

70
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,374
(Woman) Who is it, Jessie?

71
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,578
- Hello, Mama.
- Well, I just swan. Marnie!

72
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:20,696
If you're not the very limit.

73
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,695
I can't take in the way you jump
all over the place like you do.

74
00:09:25,421 --> 00:09:28,936
(Mama) Boston, Massachusetts.
Elizabeth, New Jersey.

75
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,651
I brought you
some chrysanthemums.

76
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:38,452
Those gladiolas are brand fresh.
Miss Cotton brought 'em last night.

77
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,732
I never could stand gladiolas.
I ' ll get rid of these.

78
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,131
For land's sake - Marnie,
now watch the dripping.

79
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,294
Here, Jessica, why don't you
take these home to your mother?

80
00:09:48,461 --> 00:09:50,417
She don't get home from work till 6::00.

81
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:53,537
I'm supposed to stay here till 6::00.

82
00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:55,895
Take them to the kitchen then.
Just get rid of them.

83
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,373
Take 'em to the kitchen
before they drip all over.

84
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,858
We could stand gladiolas!

85
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:08,972
I send you plenty of money.
You don't have to be a baby-sitter.

86
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,653
Whoever said I did have to?
It's my pleasure.

87
00:10:13,418 --> 00:10:16,138
That smart little ol' Jessie.

88
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:19,018
Marnie, if you could just hear
some of the things that she says.

89
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:21,249
Oh, but I do.

90
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:23,410
Seems I get a report
in exhaustive detail

91
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:26,889
on all the bright sayings
of ol' Jessie Cotton.

92
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,935
What's more, every time I come home,
she's roosting here.

93
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:36,047
I see that you've lighted up
your hair, Marnie.

94
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:40,132
- A little. Why? Don't you like it?
- No.

95
00:10:40,859 --> 00:10:45,296
Too-blonde hair always looks like a
woman's tryin' to attract the man.

96
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:48,131
Men and a good name
don't go together.

97
00:10:50,538 --> 00:10:52,847
I brought you something, Mama.

98
00:10:54,978 --> 00:10:57,538
Now what have you thrown
good money away on?

99
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:00,015
Oh, Marnie.

100
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:03,295
You shouldn't spend all your money
on me like you do.

101
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,812
But that's what
money's for: to spend.

102
00:11:05,977 --> 00:11:08,446
Like the Bible says,
"Money answereth all things."

103
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:14,208
We don't talk smart about the Bible
in this house, missy!

104
00:11:19,298 --> 00:11:22,894
Well, I just swan! How do I wear it?

105
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:26,412
Like this. Real high up under the chin.

106
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:28,852
(Marnie) Oh, it's smart,
it's very, very smart.

107
00:11:29,016 --> 00:11:32,646
Goin' around buyin' fur pieces
like they was nothin'.

108
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,091
Mr Pemberton gave me another raise.

109
00:11:35,256 --> 00:11:40,092
I told Miss Cotton my daughter is
private secretary to a millionaire.

110
00:11:40,257 --> 00:11:43,886
He's as generous with her
as if she was his very own daughter.

111
00:11:44,057 --> 00:11:47,048
Miss Bernice, don't you want
to get my hair brushed up

112
00:11:47,216 --> 00:11:50,253
- before my mommy gets home?
- I sure do, honey.

113
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,567
You run up and get the brush.

114
00:11:54,057 --> 00:11:56,331
Oh, that kid and her hair.

115
00:11:57,176 --> 00:12:01,135
Puts me in mind of yours
when you was little. The colour.

116
00:12:02,336 --> 00:12:04,929
This side of the street
don't get the afternoon sun.

117
00:12:05,095 --> 00:12:07,371
My hip and my leg
ache me somethin' awful.

118
00:12:10,656 --> 00:12:13,615
(Footsteps)

119
00:12:15,496 --> 00:12:18,135
I got the hairbrush!

120
00:12:19,535 --> 00:12:22,494
Uh, Marnie, mind my leg.

121
00:12:40,655 --> 00:12:43,250
(Mama) I never had time
to take care of Marnie 's hair

122
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,372
when she was a little kid like you.

123
00:12:45,536 --> 00:12:48,651
- How come?
- Oh, child!

124
00:12:48,814 --> 00:12:52,171
Well, after I had my bad accident,

125
00:12:52,335 --> 00:12:55,690
first I was sick so long,
and then I had to work.

126
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,894
(Jessie) Didn't you all have
a daddy either?

127
00:12:59,054 --> 00:13:02,888
No, we didn't. We surely did not!

128
00:13:03,054 --> 00:13:05,046
There.

129
00:13:05,215 --> 00:13:07,444
As pretty as brushin' can make you.

130
00:13:08,294 --> 00:13:12,049
Oh, sugarpop, it's five after 6:00.
You better scat on home.

131
00:13:12,215 --> 00:13:16,287
And you be sure to take
your mama those glads.

132
00:13:18,693 --> 00:13:21,447
How ' bout my pie?
How ' bout my pecan pie?

133
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:24,526
I ' ll get it done tonight
and bring it over to you.

134
00:13:24,694 --> 00:13:26,845
Now, Jessie, you mind
you go straight home.

135
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:31,212
OK. Bye, Miss Bernice.
See you later, Miss Bernice.

136
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:35,728
(Door Opens, Closes)

137
00:13:36,454 --> 00:13:38,762
Do you really like the scarf, Mama?

138
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:41,164
It's real mink.

139
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:43,768
Oh, there. You look
just like an old man's darling.

140
00:13:44,934 --> 00:13:47,004
No man ever give me
anything so good.

141
00:13:48,253 --> 00:13:49,972
We don't need men, Mama.

142
00:13:50,134 --> 00:13:53,728
We can do very well for ourselves.
You and me.

143
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:56,772
A decent woman
don't have need for any man.

144
00:13:58,173 --> 00:13:59,891
Look at you, Marnie.

145
00:14:00,053 --> 00:14:02,567
I told Miss Cotton,
look at my girl Marnie.

146
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:07,325
She's too smart to go gettin' herself
mixed up with men... none of 'em!

147
00:14:09,332 --> 00:14:12,688
Well, let's go on back to the kitchen.

148
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:15,730
I've got to see to that pie.

149
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:35,687
Uh, Marnie, I've been
thinking seriously

150
00:14:35,852 --> 00:14:38,730
about asking Miss Cotton and Jessie
to move in here with me.

151
00:14:39,732 --> 00:14:43,611
Miss Cotton is a real nice woman.

152
00:14:43,772 --> 00:14:47,924
She's decent. A hard-working woman
with a little girl to raise.

153
00:14:48,132 --> 00:14:50,770
Come on, Mama, why don't
you just say what you mean?

154
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,047
What you want is for Jessie
to come live with you.

155
00:14:56,452 --> 00:15:00,364
Marnie, you oughtn't let yourself act
jealous of a little ol' kid like that.

156
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:03,682
She don't bother me none.

157
00:15:03,851 --> 00:15:06,206
And we could always use
the extra money.

158
00:15:06,371 --> 00:15:08,202
The Cottons are mighty decent people.

159
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,885
Why don't you love me, Mama?

160
00:15:16,892 --> 00:15:20,406
I 've always wondered why you don't.

161
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,047
You never give me one part
of the love you give Jessie.

162
00:15:28,411 --> 00:15:30,844
Mama -

163
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:33,169
Why do you always
move away from me?

164
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:35,605
Why? What's wrong with me?

165
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,320
Nothing! Nothing's wrong with you.

166
00:15:39,491 --> 00:15:40,888
No. You don't think that.

167
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:43,244
You've always thought there
was something wrong with me.

168
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:45,201
- Haven't you? Always!
- I never.

169
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,358
My God! When I think
of the things I've done

170
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,919
to try to make you love me.

171
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,648
The things I've done!

172
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:00,085
Hm. What are you
thinking now, Mama?

173
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,968
About the things I've done?

174
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,917
What do you think they are?
Things that aren't decent, is that it?

175
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:08,728
Well, you think
I'm Mr Pemberton's girl.

176
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,403
Is that why you don't
want me to touch you?

177
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,322
Is that how you think I get
the money to set you up?

178
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:24,405
I'm... I'm sorry, Mama.

179
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:27,527
I don't know what got
into me talking like that.

180
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:29,965
I know you've never really
thought anything bad about me.

181
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,768
No, I never.

182
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:35,676
Well, I'm sorry. I really am.

183
00:16:35,848 --> 00:16:39,967
- I'll pick up the pecans.
- No, you go upstairs and lay down.

184
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:44,168
You're all wore out. I'll ask Jessie
to come over and pick up the nuts.

185
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:46,638
Alright.

186
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:52,803
After all... it is Jessie's pie, isn't it?

187
00:17:02,168 --> 00:17:04,158
(Clunking)

188
00:17:12,007 --> 00:17:15,477
No, I don't want to. Mama, no!

189
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:19,477
Marnie, wake up. Marnie?

190
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:22,003
Don't make me move, Mama.
It's too cold.

191
00:17:22,168 --> 00:17:24,283
Wake up, Marnie.
You're still dreaming.

192
00:17:25,727 --> 00:17:29,243
- Get washed up. Supper's ready.
- Oh.

193
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:33,005
I was having that old dream again.

194
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:37,001
- First the tapping and then -
- I said supper's ready.

195
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:41,922
It's always when
you come to the door.

196
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:43,965
That's when the cold starts.

197
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:16,558
- Miss Clabon.
- Good morning.

198
00:19:16,725 --> 00:19:18,204
Is Mr Ward in his office?

199
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,958
Yes. He's interviewing for
the new office assistant.

200
00:19:21,964 --> 00:19:23,920
Rutland and Company is
an old established publishing -

201
00:19:24,084 --> 00:19:28,123
- Oh, Mr Rutland.
- This is Miss Blakely, Mr Rutland.

202
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:32,037
Well done. You'll hear from us,
Miss Blakely, I'm sure.

203
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,514
Thank you for your time, Mr Ward.
Good day, Mr Rutland.

204
00:19:34,685 --> 00:19:36,960
Good day, Miss Blakely.

205
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:41,197
Well, I guess that does it. She seems
to have the exact qualifications -

206
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,802
Come in for a moment, please.

207
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:59,315
Now, sit down, Mrs... Taylor.

208
00:19:59,482 --> 00:20:01,473
Thank you.

209
00:20:01,762 --> 00:20:04,596
(Ward) I have here your
Pittsburgh references.

210
00:20:04,763 --> 00:20:08,277
Reference, that is. Kendall's, yes.

211
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:10,195
This the only reference
you have to show us?

212
00:20:10,363 --> 00:20:14,356
Well, Mr Ward, I have good training,
but I've had very little actual experience.

213
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:16,319
Kendall ' s was my first real job.

214
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:20,077
After I finished school, I was married.
My husband was a CPA.

215
00:20:20,242 --> 00:20:22,119
He helped me keep up
with my training.

216
00:20:22,282 --> 00:20:25,320
I learned a great deal more from him:
accounting, cost-price,

217
00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:28,316
- even something about computers.
- (Ward) I see.

218
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:32,112
When my husband died
very suddenly last November,

219
00:20:32,283 --> 00:20:35,399
he left me a little money,
but I felt I needed work.

220
00:20:35,562 --> 00:20:37,712
Good, hard, demanding work.

221
00:20:38,963 --> 00:20:41,271
I got the job at Kendall's,
but it was -

222
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:42,921
Well, it wasn't a
very exacting position,

223
00:20:43,082 --> 00:20:46,837
and there didn't seem much chance
for anything else at Kendall's.

224
00:20:47,003 --> 00:20:49,800
I don't mean pay. Salary isn't the most
important thing with me,

225
00:20:49,962 --> 00:20:52,600
but more interesting work, Mr Ward.

226
00:20:52,761 --> 00:20:56,118
Something that
will keep me busy, occupied.

227
00:20:56,962 --> 00:20:59,839
I don't care how much work
I'm given or what hours I work.

228
00:21:00,001 --> 00:21:03,153
(Ward) Uh, Mrs Taylor,
why did you leave Pittsburgh?

229
00:21:03,322 --> 00:21:05,517
After my husband died, I just -

230
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:08,435
(Ward) Mrs Taylor, this is a post
of some confidence.

231
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:12,309
(Marnie) Oh, please, let me have
a chance to prove myself, Mr Ward.

232
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:21,354
Uh... very well, Mrs Taylor.

233
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,232
I suppose you might as well
report to work on Monday.

234
00:21:27,841 --> 00:21:31,594
Miss Clabon in the
outer office will brief you.

235
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,277
I'll be out in just a moment.

236
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,797
Taking her on without references?
You' re always such a stickler -

237
00:21:39,961 --> 00:21:43,589
Let's just say I'm an interested
spectator in the passing parade.

238
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,638
I don't get it.

239
00:21:45,801 --> 00:21:48,075
You're not supposed to get it.

240
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:53,271
Hi, Miss Clabon.

241
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,635
Hello, Mr Sam.
How's the curmudgeon business?

242
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,030
Oh, Miss Mainwaring!

243
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,509
Is Mark in? I want a free lunch,
and somebody to cash a check.

244
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,954
I thought I'd stick Mark
for the lunch and you for the cash.

245
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:07,076
Go right on in.

246
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,111
(Ward) You have your
Social Security card, Mrs Taylor?

247
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,193
- Of course. Right here in my purse.
- Who 's the dish?

248
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,396
Miss Clabon will show you around.
She's been with us for seven years.

249
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,393
I believe she finds the work
exacting enough. Good day, Mrs Taylor.

250
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:25,993
Miss Clabon, will you call personnel
and have them send the forms up?

251
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,515
Certainly, Mr Ward.

252
00:22:34,198 --> 00:22:36,474
(Miss Clabon) Hello.
This is Mr Ward's office.

253
00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:40,348
Would you send up a W-4
and the rest of the employment forms?

254
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:42,587
Yes, before lunch. I'll wait.

255
00:22:42,757 --> 00:22:44,874
Thank you.

256
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:48,826
Maud, what about Saturday?

257
00:22:48,998 --> 00:22:51,593
No, I only thought as you said
your mother wasn 't coming with us,

258
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:54,033
I just wanted to make sure
about our reservations.

259
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:57,878
Well, why don 't you call me back?

260
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:00,876
Alright. Anytime.

261
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:09,507
Thanks, Mr Sam, I ' ll try not
to do anything sensible with it.

262
00:23:11,998 --> 00:23:14,114
- Bye, Miss Clabon.
- Bye.

263
00:23:14,278 --> 00:23:17,588
That's Lil Mainwaring,
Mr Rutland's sister-in-law.

264
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:20,596
- Her sister was Mr Rutland's wife.
- Was?

265
00:23:20,758 --> 00:23:23,352
She died about a year and a half ago.
Some kind of heart thing.

266
00:23:23,877 --> 00:23:26,027
Imagine. Only 29.

267
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:28,632
Well, anyway,
she kind of brought Lil up.

268
00:23:29,198 --> 00:23:31,393
Lil lived with them
and old Mr Rutland down at Wykwyn.

269
00:23:32,238 --> 00:23:36,150
I get the feeling little ol' Lil
plans to stay on... permanently.

270
00:24:35,356 --> 00:24:38,665
Anyway, like I was saying,
old Mr Rutland - that's Mark's father -

271
00:24:38,835 --> 00:24:41,225
they say he's never
even been inside this place.

272
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:44,433
The company was headed into
the ground when Mark took over.

273
00:24:44,596 --> 00:24:49,112
They say the first week
he was here he retired... ha, retired,

274
00:24:49,276 --> 00:24:52,711
three board members, the acting
president, the president's secretary.

275
00:24:55,276 --> 00:24:56,708
Coffee time, ladies.

276
00:25:00,515 --> 00:25:04,225
- Do you mind bringing me a cup?
- Just coffee? Donut, Danish?

277
00:25:04,396 --> 00:25:08,228
- Lady, have I got for you a Danish!
- No, just coffee.

278
00:25:08,394 --> 00:25:11,307
- Oh, I'm out of red ink.
- Oh, here, use mine.

279
00:25:11,555 --> 00:25:14,433
- I'll get it.
- No, no, I will.

280
00:25:17,394 --> 00:25:18,713
Thanks.

281
00:25:39,394 --> 00:25:41,271
Mrs Taylor, are you hurt?

282
00:25:41,434 --> 00:25:43,823
(Mark) Mrs Taylor!

283
00:25:44,553 --> 00:25:46,111
I think she's hurt. Find out!

284
00:25:47,514 --> 00:25:49,868
Mary, are you alright?

285
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:52,391
What?

286
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:55,148
Of course, I'm alright. I just
spilled a little ink on my blouse.

287
00:25:55,314 --> 00:25:58,225
The way you rushed out of the office -
Mr Rutland's standing out there.

288
00:25:58,393 --> 00:26:00,588
- He said he thought you were hurt.
- Well, I'm not.

289
00:26:00,753 --> 00:26:04,268
All that happened was I spilled
a little ink on my blouse.

290
00:26:04,433 --> 00:26:07,152
Good heavens! What a lot
of excitement over nothing.

291
00:26:32,193 --> 00:26:35,105
(Phone Ringing)

292
00:26:38,394 --> 00:26:41,064
Why in the world does he keep locking
and unlocking that drawer?

293
00:26:41,231 --> 00:26:43,301
He never can remember
the safe combination.

294
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:44,791
It's locked in that drawer.

295
00:26:44,952 --> 00:26:47,227
Mr Rutland and I have keys too,
for emergencies.

296
00:26:48,632 --> 00:26:50,462
It's only five numbers,
for Pete's sake.

297
00:26:53,392 --> 00:26:56,987
Mrs Taylor? I've just had a call from
Mr Rutland, Mrs Taylor.

298
00:26:58,191 --> 00:27:01,183
He remembered your saying
you'd be willing to work overtime.

299
00:27:01,951 --> 00:27:04,101
He wondered if you'd be prepared
to work on Saturday?

300
00:27:04,271 --> 00:27:08,106
- Saturday? Of course. What time?
- Two-thirty.

301
00:27:08,272 --> 00:27:10,785
I ' ll advise Mr Rutland
that you are available.

302
00:27:39,831 --> 00:27:41,104
(Thunderclaps)

303
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:03,188
- (Knocking)
- (Mark) Come in, Mrs Taylor.

304
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,189
Good afternoon, Mr Rutland.

305
00:28:13,389 --> 00:28:15,584
Are you interested in
pre-Columbian art, Mrs Taylor?

306
00:28:16,269 --> 00:28:19,067
Those were collected
by my wife. She's dead.

307
00:28:19,229 --> 00:28:20,822
The only things of hers I 've kept.

308
00:28:22,349 --> 00:28:25,864
And that's Sophie. She 's a jaguarundi.

309
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:29,704
South American. I, uh... trained her.

310
00:28:29,869 --> 00:28:31,825
Oh? What did you train her to do?

311
00:28:32,548 --> 00:28:33,822
To trust me.

312
00:28:34,348 --> 00:28:35,668
Is that all?

313
00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:38,304
That's a great deal...
for a jaguarundi.

314
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:41,028
Shall we get to work?

315
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:43,625
You can use the typewriter over there.

316
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:46,064
I want an original
and one copy of this.

317
00:28:46,229 --> 00:28:48,059
If you can't decipher
any of this, speak up.

318
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:51,027
I typed it myself and
I'm a very creative typist.

319
00:28:57,629 --> 00:29:01,019
"Arboreal Predators
of the Brazilian Rain Forest."

320
00:29:01,189 --> 00:29:03,942
Before I was drafted
into Rutland's, Mrs Taylor,

321
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,780
I had notions of being a zoologist.

322
00:29:05,948 --> 00:29:09,258
- I still try to keep up with my field.
- Zoos?

323
00:29:10,508 --> 00:29:11,908
Instinctual behaviour.

324
00:29:12,069 --> 00:29:15,504
Oh. Does zoology include people,
Mr Rutland?

325
00:29:16,228 --> 00:29:18,902
Well, in a way. It includes all
the animal ancestors

326
00:29:19,069 --> 00:29:20,787
from whom man derived his instincts.

327
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,181
Ladies' instincts too?

328
00:29:24,187 --> 00:29:26,542
That paper deals with
the instincts of predators.

329
00:29:26,707 --> 00:29:29,016
What you might call the criminal class
of the animal world.

330
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:33,458
Lady animals figure
very largely as predators.

331
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:44,624
(Thunderclaps)

332
00:29:50,507 --> 00:29:52,179
Put on the overhead light if you like.

333
00:29:52,347 --> 00:29:54,735
The switch is by the door.

334
00:29:56,707 --> 00:29:58,902
(Thunderclaps)

335
00:30:09,146 --> 00:30:10,978
Why don't you sit down, Mrs Taylor?

336
00:30:11,147 --> 00:30:15,219
If the storm worries you that much,
I'll get you something to drink.

337
00:30:16,986 --> 00:30:19,022
Mrs Taylor?

338
00:30:29,826 --> 00:30:32,944
The building is grounded, Mrs Taylor.

339
00:30:35,786 --> 00:30:38,663
You' re quite safe here...

340
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,979
from the lightning.

341
00:30:46,105 --> 00:30:47,937
The colours! Stop the colours!

342
00:30:48,106 --> 00:30:50,494
What colours?

343
00:31:26,305 --> 00:31:29,899
It's over. All over. You're alright.

344
00:31:31,545 --> 00:31:34,422
OK now? Would you like something
to drink? Some brandy?

345
00:31:34,584 --> 00:31:38,862
- No, thank you. I'm awfully sorry.
- Oh, don't be silly.

346
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:42,778
- Why do colours bother you?
- Colours?

347
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:45,413
You seem to be terrified
of some colours.

348
00:31:45,585 --> 00:31:50,055
No, no. What I'm terrified
of is thunder and lightning.

349
00:31:50,224 --> 00:31:54,183
I wouldn't have pegged you as a woman
terrified of anything.

350
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:09,779
Well, we've all got to go sometime.

351
00:32:11,423 --> 00:32:14,061
Look, this place is wrecked
and you're in no state to work.

352
00:32:14,222 --> 00:32:16,373
Suppose I drive you home.
You can do this job some other time.

353
00:32:16,543 --> 00:32:19,454
- Thank you. I -
- Go get your things.

354
00:32:23,423 --> 00:32:24,902
It's cold and damp here.

355
00:32:25,063 --> 00:32:28,259
I must get the maintenance people in.

356
00:32:44,943 --> 00:32:48,935
- I'm really sorry about the cabinet.
- Why should you be?

357
00:32:49,102 --> 00:32:51,616
You said it was all
you had left of your wife.

358
00:32:51,782 --> 00:32:54,899
I said it was all I had left
that had belonged to my wife.

359
00:32:55,062 --> 00:32:57,018
Oh.

360
00:32:58,423 --> 00:33:00,777
(Car Radio) "Native Winkler is second.
Hopeless is third."

361
00:33:00,942 --> 00:33:03,661
Oh, no please. I'd like to hear.

362
00:33:03,821 --> 00:33:05,892
- You like racing?
- I like horses.

363
00:33:06,062 --> 00:33:08,212
I go to the races when I can.

364
00:33:08,382 --> 00:33:12,420
- Was your husband a track fan?
- Yes.

365
00:33:12,581 --> 00:33:15,574
- And you go alone now?
- Yes.

366
00:33:17,502 --> 00:33:19,299
Atlantic City track's open
till the end of the month.

367
00:33:19,462 --> 00:33:22,578
We could drive out there next Saturday.

368
00:33:22,741 --> 00:33:24,333
Alright.

369
00:33:24,501 --> 00:33:27,459
- Are you fond of horses?
- No, not at all.

370
00:33:30,182 --> 00:33:32,172
(PA Announcer) "Fast Return
moving up on the outside. "

371
00:33:34,781 --> 00:33:37,454
(Announcer Continues)

372
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,170
Well, that's another one.

373
00:33:57,421 --> 00:33:58,819
Oh, I like it here like this.

374
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:03,211
You' re the expert.
What do you like in the next race?

375
00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:05,848
Lemon Pudding. He's finished third
his last three times out.

376
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:09,057
- Got a good jockey up today.
- Lemon Pudding it is.

377
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:13,816
The morning line says he's four to one.
I'll get on him.

378
00:34:18,499 --> 00:34:19,819
(Man) Pardon me.

379
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,209
But you're Peggy Nicholson, aren't you?

380
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:24,178
Remember me?

381
00:34:25,299 --> 00:34:27,018
I'm sorry. What did you say?

382
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:31,173
- Aren't you Peggy Nicholson?
- No, I'm not.

383
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:35,094
Yeah? I was pretty sure you were.
When I first saw you down here -

384
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:38,410
I'm sorry, you've made a mistake.
I am not Miss Nichols.

385
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:40,695
- Nicholson.
- Nicholson.

386
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,297
Frank Abernathy introduced us
a couple of years ago in Detroit.

387
00:34:45,979 --> 00:34:48,858
Frank Abernathy.
You remember Frank.

388
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,409
No, I do not know anyone
named Frank Abernathy.

389
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:55,173
I have never known anyone
named Frank Abernathy.

390
00:34:55,338 --> 00:34:57,728
- Now, will you please go?
- Aw, come on now, honey.

391
00:34:57,899 --> 00:35:00,048
You're trying to pull my leg,
aren't you?

392
00:35:00,218 --> 00:35:02,493
(Mark) Now, why should any young lady
want to pull your leg?

393
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:06,335
Oh, sorry. I thought
I recognised this lady.

394
00:35:06,498 --> 00:35:08,056
- Did he recognise you?
- No.

395
00:35:08,218 --> 00:35:11,928
- You did not recognise her.
- I said I thought I recognised her.

396
00:35:12,098 --> 00:35:14,816
- I said I'm sorry.
- Good for you. You've apologised.

397
00:35:14,977 --> 00:35:17,366
You may go now.

398
00:35:21,618 --> 00:35:24,894
- You came back so quickly.
- Yes. Who's your fan?

399
00:35:25,058 --> 00:35:27,288
I just seem to have one of those faces.

400
00:35:28,018 --> 00:35:29,690
Well, what do you like
in the next race?

401
00:35:29,858 --> 00:35:32,497
Can we go to the paddock?
I'd like to see Telepathy.

402
00:35:32,658 --> 00:35:36,536
Been watching him ever since I saw him
work out once as a two-year-old.

403
00:35:59,417 --> 00:36:02,376
Oh, I believe that's
our old friend Telepathy.

404
00:36:02,778 --> 00:36:05,007
Yeah, number eight. Telepathy.

405
00:36:12,097 --> 00:36:15,771
He 's a lanky-looking piece of business,
but I bow to your superior knowledge.

406
00:36:15,936 --> 00:36:18,974
- What is it? What ' s the matter?
- Don't bet him.

407
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:21,776
- Why not?
- He's walleyed.

408
00:36:21,937 --> 00:36:24,690
Can we go now?

409
00:36:36,055 --> 00:36:39,844
What a paragon you are.
You don't smoke, drink or gamble.

410
00:36:40,376 --> 00:36:42,367
Just this once... for luck.

411
00:36:42,536 --> 00:36:45,254
- I don't believe in luck.
- What do you believe in?

412
00:36:46,255 --> 00:36:47,574
Nothing.

413
00:36:49,055 --> 00:36:51,011
Oh, horses, maybe.
At least they're beautiful,

414
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:53,451
and nothing in this world like people.

415
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:56,485
Oh, yes, people. A thoroughly bad lot.

416
00:36:56,655 --> 00:36:58,134
Generally.

417
00:36:58,295 --> 00:37:00,366
Did you have a tough childhood,
Mrs Taylor?

418
00:37:00,536 --> 00:37:01,854
Not particularly

419
00:37:02,935 --> 00:37:07,052
I think you did. I think you've had
a hard, tough climb.

420
00:37:07,214 --> 00:37:09,445
But you're a smart girl, aren't you?

421
00:37:09,615 --> 00:37:12,004
The careful grammar,
the quiet good manners.

422
00:37:12,175 --> 00:37:15,486
- Where did you learn them?
- From my betters.

423
00:37:16,496 --> 00:37:18,963
What about your tough childhood,
Mr Rutland?

424
00:37:19,135 --> 00:37:22,172
The old, sad story.
Promising youth blighted.

425
00:37:22,335 --> 00:37:26,010
Dragged down by money,
position, noblesse oblige.

426
00:37:26,975 --> 00:37:30,047
By the time I came along,
the company was hanging on the ropes.

427
00:37:30,215 --> 00:37:33,173
We had about 1,000 employees who were
about to go down for the count.

428
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:34,654
What about the Rutlands?

429
00:37:34,815 --> 00:37:36,727
What would've happened to your family?

430
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:39,124
Nothing ever happens to a family that
traditionally marries

431
00:37:39,294 --> 00:37:41,285
at least one heiress
every other generation.

432
00:37:41,454 --> 00:37:42,773
(Crowd Cheering)

433
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:49,567
You shouldn't've chickened. Your
walleyed reject just won by 4 lengths.

434
00:37:52,134 --> 00:37:54,284
I think I've had enough. Can we go?

435
00:37:54,454 --> 00:37:55,773
If you like.

436
00:37:55,934 --> 00:37:57,764
The track's open
till the end of the month.

437
00:37:57,933 --> 00:38:00,731
That gives us two more Saturdays.

438
00:38:00,893 --> 00:38:05,569
If your luck holds out, by this time
next month, I'll be a rich man.

439
00:38:13,534 --> 00:38:17,446
- Oh, Miss Nicholson.
- You really are pressing your luck.

440
00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:26,966
Where are we going this time?

441
00:38:27,133 --> 00:38:30,443
I thought it was time I brought you
home to meet my old man.

442
00:38:30,613 --> 00:38:33,570
- You should've told me.
- You're alright.

443
00:38:33,732 --> 00:38:37,328
Dad goes by scent. If you smell
anything like a horse, you're in.

444
00:38:54,812 --> 00:38:58,283
Here we are, old bean. The homestead.

445
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:14,364
- Hello, Dad.
- Who's this?

446
00:39:14,531 --> 00:39:16,408
This is Mary Taylor.
Mary, this is my father.

447
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:18,641
- How do you do, Mr Rutland?
- A girl, is it?

448
00:39:18,811 --> 00:39:22,121
It's alright, Dad. She's not really
a girl, she's a horse-fancier.

449
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:24,885
The track's closed. I thought if
I brought her to see your horses,

450
00:39:25,051 --> 00:39:27,885
- I'd hold her attention a bit longer.
- Splendid, splendid!

451
00:39:28,052 --> 00:39:32,089
Come along, my dear.
I was just about to have a cup of tea.

452
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:40,405
Oh, Mary, this is my
sister-in-law, Lil Mainwaring.

453
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:42,323
- Mary Taylor.
- How do you do?

454
00:39:42,731 --> 00:39:44,722
Hi. I've seen you
at Rutland's, haven't I?

455
00:39:44,891 --> 00:39:49,203
(Rutland) It bewilders me what any
of you can find to do at Rutland's.

456
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:55,319
Oh, dear! I think I rather sprained
my wrist this afternoon.

457
00:39:55,690 --> 00:40:00,481
There 's sure to be droppage
and spillage. Would you mind awfully?

458
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:05,559
(Rutland) Strong, please.
No milk, two lumps of sugar.

459
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:08,085
The meals in this house
are shocking bad,

460
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,765
but I do insist on good
Horn and Hardart cake at tea.

461
00:40:10,931 --> 00:40:14,081
You take yours with lemon,
don't you, Lil?

462
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,605
Yes, lemon for Lil, Mary.

463
00:40:18,131 --> 00:40:20,122
Strong with a dash of rum for me.

464
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:23,645
(Rutland) Spinster's tea.
Mucking up tea with strong drink.

465
00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:27,359
- Something sneaky about it, eh?
- What's your opinion, Miss Taylor?

466
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:29,839
Do you think old Mark here
is a sneaky one?

467
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:32,999
Possibly.

468
00:40:34,409 --> 00:40:36,525
How do you take your tea, Miss Taylor?

469
00:40:36,689 --> 00:40:38,839
Usually with a cup
of hot water and a tea bag.

470
00:40:39,009 --> 00:40:41,319
(Rutland) Lazy habit, my dear.

471
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,956
I'll have quite a large slice
of that butter cake, please.

472
00:40:44,128 --> 00:40:46,722
- Do you ride, Miss Taylor?
- A little.

473
00:40:46,888 --> 00:40:49,119
Best thing in the world
for the inside of a man or woman

474
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:51,325
is the outside of a horse.

475
00:40:51,489 --> 00:40:53,399
I shouldn't think you'd find
old Mark very interesting.

476
00:40:53,928 --> 00:40:55,647
- Doesn't hunt. Doesn't even ride!
- Please, Dad!

477
00:40:55,809 --> 00:40:57,925
I was hoping to lead up
gently to all that.

478
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:00,602
I'd even planned to show her
the horses first.

479
00:41:01,328 --> 00:41:03,478
Swill that down or bring it
with you to the stables.

480
00:41:03,648 --> 00:41:06,481
Mark's trying to act as if he brought
Miss Taylor out to see the horses.

481
00:41:06,648 --> 00:41:09,846
- He really brought her to see me.
- Really? Whatever for?

482
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,364
Showing off. I'm quite
a presentable old party, you know.

483
00:41:13,009 --> 00:41:15,158
Lil, I 'm sure your sturdy young wrist

484
00:41:15,328 --> 00:41:18,525
has recovered sufficiently
to pour Dad another cup of tea.

485
00:41:18,688 --> 00:41:20,804
- I will have another cup.
- I can't!

486
00:41:20,968 --> 00:41:23,402
"When duty whispers low, thou must."

487
00:41:23,568 --> 00:41:26,958
"Then youth replies, I can."

488
00:41:27,128 --> 00:41:30,757
Ratfink! And you misquoted!

489
00:41:56,886 --> 00:41:59,116
Will you come up and spend
next weekend with us?

490
00:41:59,286 --> 00:42:03,644
You can bring your tea bag,
have your pick of the horses.

491
00:42:09,407 --> 00:42:11,045
Good night, Mary. I have to run.
See you on Monday.

492
00:42:11,207 --> 00:42:13,242
Good night, Susan.

493
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,805
(Woman) Good night. See you on Monday.

494
00:42:36,205 --> 00:42:39,198
I haven't got my powder puff.
Have you got one?

495
00:42:39,966 --> 00:42:42,526
- Come on.
- Wait a minute.

496
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,120
- Come on.
- Alright, I'm coming.

497
00:42:46,286 --> 00:42:49,278
You mean we have to hang around
and wait until he calls?

498
00:42:49,446 --> 00:42:52,165
- Good night, girls.
- Good night. I'll see you.

499
00:42:52,326 --> 00:42:53,918
- Have a good weekend.
- Yeah.

500
00:42:54,086 --> 00:42:56,440
I think that's terrible.

501
00:42:56,605 --> 00:42:58,755
- What are you gonna do?
- I don 't know. Let's get home.

502
00:42:58,926 --> 00:43:00,245
He may have already called you.

503
00:43:00,406 --> 00:43:02,237
If I miss his call,
that's the way it goes.

504
00:43:02,406 --> 00:43:04,556
This is the best one you 've had!

505
00:43:04,726 --> 00:43:06,285
(Door Closes)

506
00:43:19,484 --> 00:43:21,396
(Indistinct Chatting)

507
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,517
(Clunking Noise)

508
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,792
(Door Opens, Closes)

509
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,628
You' re sure makin' time tonight, Rita.
What's the big rush?

510
00:46:52,799 --> 00:46:56,075
I wanna get to bed.
That's the big rush.

511
00:47:28,557 --> 00:47:30,788
Please get down.

512
00:47:30,958 --> 00:47:34,155
You'll walk back to the stables.
I'll ride.

513
00:47:35,157 --> 00:47:38,628
Are you stayin' at an inn or have you
friends among the local gentry?

514
00:47:38,798 --> 00:47:41,710
- You said you didn't trust horses.
- I don't, but they trust me.

515
00:47:41,878 --> 00:47:45,392
Which brings us directly to our
relationship, Miss Edgar!

516
00:47:55,597 --> 00:47:59,511
Is Edgar your real name?
And you're blonde.

517
00:47:59,678 --> 00:48:03,386
You'll save time and make for better
feeling if you tell me the truth.

518
00:48:03,557 --> 00:48:07,186
Is Edgar your real name?
Now, don't crowd me, lady!

519
00:48:07,357 --> 00:48:09,712
I'm fighting a powerful impulse
to beat the hell out of you.

520
00:48:11,997 --> 00:48:13,316
At last we communicate.

521
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:16,794
Now, for the third and last time,
is Edgar your real name?

522
00:48:16,957 --> 00:48:19,390
And don't bother to lie to me.
I'll check you out in every detail.

523
00:48:19,556 --> 00:48:23,106
- Yes. Margaret Edgar.
- Where are you from?

524
00:48:24,157 --> 00:48:25,510
California.

525
00:48:25,676 --> 00:48:27,234
- Where in California?
- Los Angeles.

526
00:48:27,396 --> 00:48:28,750
Where's the money?

527
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,187
Here! Some of it.

528
00:48:34,357 --> 00:48:36,473
- Where 's the rest?
- Don't worry. It's safe.

529
00:48:36,637 --> 00:48:40,549
Safe? At some pari-mutuel window?
Or gone on mother's operation?

530
00:48:40,716 --> 00:48:43,390
Or perhaps you're putting
your kid brother through school?

531
00:48:43,557 --> 00:48:45,991
I don't have a kid brother
or a mother. I don't have anybody.

532
00:48:46,157 --> 00:48:47,475
Not even Mr Taylor?

533
00:48:47,636 --> 00:48:50,515
I wouldn't be surprised to hear
the rest of the haul

534
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:52,951
is with your late husband, Mr Taylor.

535
00:48:53,116 --> 00:48:56,391
Somewhere I expect to find him
happily reincarnated,

536
00:48:56,554 --> 00:48:59,513
the pockets of his good blue burial
suit bulging with Rutland money.

537
00:48:59,675 --> 00:49:02,428
The rest of the money is in
a registered package addressed to me

538
00:49:02,595 --> 00:49:04,187
in a post office box in New York.

539
00:49:04,355 --> 00:49:07,074
You can pick it up there by tomorrow.
Here's the key.

540
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:10,511
Thank you, Miss Edgar.
Now I'll take the registration receipt.

541
00:49:13,196 --> 00:49:16,585
This receipt and the package are
as good as a signed confession.

542
00:49:16,755 --> 00:49:19,872
You understand that? Alright.
Now, where does Mr Taylor come in?

543
00:49:20,035 --> 00:49:22,868
There's no such person.
I 've never been married.

544
00:49:23,035 --> 00:49:25,071
Mrs Taylor was an old
friend of my mother's.

545
00:49:25,235 --> 00:49:28,307
And when you applied at Rutland's,
the name just came to your mind.

546
00:49:28,475 --> 00:49:32,104
I was trying to get away from my
cousin Jessie. She's no good.

547
00:49:32,275 --> 00:49:35,824
If she found out about the insurance
money, she'd try to get some.

548
00:49:35,995 --> 00:49:37,314
Make trouble for me.

549
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:40,784
- What insurance money?
- Mrs Taylor's.

550
00:49:40,954 --> 00:49:43,867
- She died.
- Oh, Mrs Taylor died. Pity.

551
00:49:44,035 --> 00:49:46,549
Now you're working with
this naughty cousin Jessie.

552
00:49:46,715 --> 00:49:48,067
Nobody's working with me!

553
00:49:48,234 --> 00:49:51,306
You talk as if this was some
regular thing I do... did.

554
00:49:51,474 --> 00:49:53,032
All planned in cold blood.

555
00:49:53,194 --> 00:49:55,754
- And it wasn't?
- No!

556
00:49:55,914 --> 00:49:57,985
You're not from Los Angeles,
Miss Edgar.

557
00:49:58,155 --> 00:50:00,384
Insurance is only pronounced
insurance in the South.

558
00:50:00,554 --> 00:50:02,943
And that's where you're from.
Where? Around here?

559
00:50:03,114 --> 00:50:05,948
You' re a cold-practised,
method-actress of a liar.

560
00:50:06,115 --> 00:50:08,424
- I can't help it.
- It would appear not.

561
00:50:08,594 --> 00:50:11,984
I don't mean that.
I mean, I wasn't born in California.

562
00:50:12,154 --> 00:50:14,031
I was born in Richmond, Virginia.

563
00:50:14,194 --> 00:50:16,184
My father deserted us
when I was a baby.

564
00:50:16,353 --> 00:50:19,550
My mother and I lived
in Richmond until I was seven.

565
00:50:19,713 --> 00:50:23,865
Then we went to California.
Mother worked in aeroplane factories.

566
00:50:24,033 --> 00:50:25,786
That's the truth. I swear it!

567
00:50:25,954 --> 00:50:30,309
My mother died when I was ten.
And Mrs Taylor took care of me.

568
00:50:30,472 --> 00:50:32,542
Come on, get moving.

569
00:50:34,313 --> 00:50:35,632
How did you find me?

570
00:50:35,793 --> 00:50:38,591
You're here to answer
the questions, ol' girl.

571
00:50:38,753 --> 00:50:40,869
How did you get
the combination to Ward's safe?

572
00:50:41,033 --> 00:50:45,311
- I took Susan's key from her purse.
- I see.

573
00:50:45,473 --> 00:50:49,261
Now, suppose you just begin
at the beginning.

574
00:50:49,433 --> 00:50:54,187
It's just like I told you. I was born
in Richmond. We were poor.

575
00:50:54,352 --> 00:50:57,390
We were grindingly poor.

576
00:51:00,632 --> 00:51:04,705
- I was so alone after Mother died.
- Well, go on.

577
00:51:04,872 --> 00:51:08,228
You still have my attention.

578
00:51:08,392 --> 00:51:13,182
I just went to school and took care
of Mrs Taylor until she died.

579
00:51:13,352 --> 00:51:17,904
She left me her house
and $5,000 in insurance.

580
00:51:20,792 --> 00:51:25,820
I sold the house. It had a mortgage
so I only got $9,000 cash.

581
00:51:26,592 --> 00:51:30,585
But there I was with $14,000! Me!

582
00:51:30,752 --> 00:51:33,061
I could do exactly
what I wanted to with it.

583
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,787
There isn't much more. I bought Forio.

584
00:51:36,952 --> 00:51:39,944
- Forio?
- My horse at Garrod's.

585
00:51:40,112 --> 00:51:42,385
I had two wonderful years.

586
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:45,826
Then last November it was all gone
so I had to get a job.

587
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:47,982
I went to Pittsburgh
and got the job at Kendall's

588
00:51:48,151 --> 00:51:50,142
until I could look around
for something better.

589
00:51:50,311 --> 00:51:51,902
Alright, let's try again.

590
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:57,065
Let's back up and turn that Mt Everest
of manure into a few facts.

591
00:51:57,231 --> 00:51:58,744
One: Your dates are all wrong.

592
00:51:58,911 --> 00:52:01,505
Previously you were employed
by the firm of Strutt and Company.

593
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:03,581
I saw you there once.

594
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:07,663
Mr Strutt is the tax consultant
for Rutland and Company.

595
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:10,106
He pointed you out to me.
You were a brunette then.

596
00:52:10,271 --> 00:52:13,660
Then some months later,
he pointed out your absence.

597
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:16,026
You mean, you knew all
about that when you hired me?

598
00:52:16,191 --> 00:52:18,146
No. I wasn't positive.

599
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:22,144
But I thought it might be interesting
to keep you around.

600
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:25,541
And all this time you've been trying
to trip me up, trap me!

601
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:29,187
Um, I 'm not sure any more.

602
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:32,547
I think I was just... curious at first.

603
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:36,668
Then things got out of control and...
I liked you.

604
00:52:36,829 --> 00:52:38,263
So I see!

605
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:41,307
Incidentally, I think
you took a bit of a chance,

606
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:45,179
knowing that Rutland's
was a client of Strutt's.

607
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:46,339
I didn't.

608
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:49,786
My job at Strutt's didn't give me
access to all the clients' names!

609
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:54,342
Alright. Let's... get on.

610
00:52:54,509 --> 00:52:56,465
We've established that
you're a thief and a liar.

611
00:52:56,949 --> 00:52:58,268
Now, what is the degree?

612
00:52:58,429 --> 00:53:01,342
Are you a compulsive thief?
A pathological liar?

613
00:53:01,509 --> 00:53:04,341
- What difference does it make?
- Some!

614
00:53:05,548 --> 00:53:07,699
It makes some difference... to me.

615
00:53:13,268 --> 00:53:15,259
Have you ever been in jail?

616
00:53:15,428 --> 00:53:17,259
Certainly not.

617
00:53:18,908 --> 00:53:21,548
I know you'll never believe me now,
and it's my own fault.

618
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:24,742
It's true about Strutt. I did it.

619
00:53:24,908 --> 00:53:29,027
I don't know why.
I just kind of went crazy, I guess, but...

620
00:53:29,189 --> 00:53:32,339
Old Mr Strutt was so -
Oh, I hated him!

621
00:53:33,308 --> 00:53:34,626
Like you hate me?

622
00:53:36,708 --> 00:53:38,027
Oh, no, not you.

623
00:53:46,748 --> 00:53:49,102
Clean up your face.

624
00:53:53,148 --> 00:53:54,865
Come on.

625
00:54:23,348 --> 00:54:25,779
Good afternoon.

626
00:54:33,906 --> 00:54:37,137
- What'll you folks have?
- A frank and a coffee, please.

627
00:54:37,306 --> 00:54:38,898
- Same for me.
- (Waitress) Okey-doke.

628
00:54:40,746 --> 00:54:42,897
Let's get on
with that little discussion.

629
00:54:43,946 --> 00:54:47,255
The chronic use of an alias is not
consistent with your story

630
00:54:47,425 --> 00:54:50,816
of sudden temptation
and unpremeditated impulse.

631
00:54:52,066 --> 00:54:54,296
What if you'd stolen almost $1 0,000?

632
00:54:54,466 --> 00:54:55,945
Wouldn't you change your name?

633
00:54:57,386 --> 00:54:59,854
Oh, what's the use? Why should I even
try to make you understand?

634
00:55:00,026 --> 00:55:02,380
I'm not only trying to understand you,
I'm trying to believe you!

635
00:55:02,545 --> 00:55:04,776
- Why?
- Because, damn it, I want to!

636
00:55:04,946 --> 00:55:07,743
Can you understand that?

637
00:55:08,385 --> 00:55:10,182
Here you are, folks.

638
00:55:11,426 --> 00:55:13,178
Mark?

639
00:55:14,746 --> 00:55:18,659
The reasons for what I did
at Rutland's,

640
00:55:18,826 --> 00:55:22,500
they were so mixed up,
what I wanted to say before.

641
00:55:23,825 --> 00:55:29,377
I needed to get away, can't you see?
Away from Rutland's.

642
00:55:30,705 --> 00:55:33,094
Don't you understand?
Things were - We were -

643
00:55:33,265 --> 00:55:35,985
So we were.
Was that any reason to run away?

644
00:55:36,146 --> 00:55:38,534
Yes. I thought it was time
I got out before I got hurt.

645
00:55:38,705 --> 00:55:41,299
I mean, why try to kid myself?

646
00:55:41,465 --> 00:55:43,899
- Are you called Margaret?
- Marnie.

647
00:55:46,825 --> 00:55:51,295
- Oh, God, Mark, if you let me go -
- I can't let you go, Marnie.

648
00:55:51,464 --> 00:55:54,661
Somebody's got to take care of you
and help you. I can't turn you loose.

649
00:55:54,824 --> 00:55:58,896
If I let you go, I 'm criminally
and morally responsible.

650
00:55:59,383 --> 00:56:00,702
Then what -

651
00:56:01,623 --> 00:56:05,537
Marnie. Yeah, that suits you.

652
00:56:07,104 --> 00:56:09,139
Alright, Marnie,
this is how it's gonna be.

653
00:56:10,104 --> 00:56:12,698
I'm driving you back to Philadelphia.

654
00:56:12,864 --> 00:56:15,616
Tonight we'll go to the house.
Tomorrow you'll go to Rutland's.

655
00:56:15,783 --> 00:56:19,139
You' ll see that Susan's key finds
its way back into her purse.

656
00:56:19,303 --> 00:56:21,100
How can I go back to Rutland's?

657
00:56:21,263 --> 00:56:24,255
You' re covered. I replaced the money.

658
00:56:25,144 --> 00:56:27,499
When I called yesterday
and found you'd pulled out,

659
00:56:27,664 --> 00:56:29,460
I knew instantly what had happened.

660
00:56:30,063 --> 00:56:32,532
So I went to Rutland's
and checked Ward's safe.

661
00:56:32,704 --> 00:56:37,060
Figured the loss and replaced it.
Then I set out to find you.

662
00:56:37,903 --> 00:56:41,612
Remember at the races
when you were hot about Telepathy?

663
00:56:42,703 --> 00:56:45,501
You'd said you'd watched him
training as a two-year-old.

664
00:56:45,663 --> 00:56:48,895
That's all I had to go on,
so I looked him up,

665
00:56:49,064 --> 00:56:52,054
and found he'd been bred by
a Colonel Marston of Virginia.

666
00:56:52,462 --> 00:56:57,491
I phoned Marston and asked him
if anyone there had horses for hire.

667
00:56:57,663 --> 00:56:59,176
He gave me the names of three.

668
00:57:00,422 --> 00:57:03,495
Yesterday I drove up to the plains,
checked out the stables. No luck.

669
00:57:03,663 --> 00:57:07,133
But at the last place, the man said
why didn't I try Garrod's

670
00:57:07,303 --> 00:57:09,659
over by Middleburg?

671
00:57:10,822 --> 00:57:12,493
(Waitress) You folks be sure
and come back now.

672
00:57:15,341 --> 00:57:17,219
Why are you taking me
back to Wykwyn?

673
00:57:18,342 --> 00:57:20,060
Because I don't trust you
not to run away.

674
00:57:20,222 --> 00:57:22,371
How can I run away?

675
00:57:22,541 --> 00:57:25,102
You have the receipt,
the post office key,

676
00:57:25,262 --> 00:57:27,981
- my name.
- Margaret Edgar.

677
00:57:28,142 --> 00:57:29,620
You sure that's
all the name you have?

678
00:57:29,781 --> 00:57:32,534
You sure you haven't misplaced an old
husband or two in your travels?

679
00:57:32,701 --> 00:57:34,692
I told you I 've never been married.

680
00:57:35,621 --> 00:57:37,020
- Near misses?
- No!

681
00:57:37,862 --> 00:57:40,012
And no lovers, no steadies, no beaus,

682
00:57:40,182 --> 00:57:42,012
no gentlemen callers, nothing!

683
00:57:43,061 --> 00:57:44,540
OK. Eat up.

684
00:57:48,101 --> 00:57:51,218
- Mark, I'd like to go freshen up.
- Uh-uh.

685
00:57:51,381 --> 00:57:54,214
You're fresh enough. Come on.

686
00:58:04,501 --> 00:58:06,058
You know, I can't believe you, Marnie.

687
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,860
There must've been a great
many men interested in you.

688
00:58:09,021 --> 00:58:12,456
I didn't say men weren't interested
in me. I wasn't interested in them.

689
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:14,892
- Never?
- No!

690
00:58:16,581 --> 00:58:18,697
That is... not until -

691
00:58:20,101 --> 00:58:23,411
- Why me?
- Because you were different, Mark.

692
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,572
It won't wash, Marnie.

693
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,092
But it's true! I really liked you.

694
00:58:30,741 --> 00:58:32,060
Yes, I think you did.

695
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:34,814
But don't try to make it sound
like any more than that.

696
00:58:35,819 --> 00:58:37,936
When we get home,

697
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:41,217
I'll explain that we had a lover's
quarrel. That you ran away.

698
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:43,448
That I went after you
and brought you back.

699
00:58:43,618 --> 00:58:46,258
That'll please Dad. He admires action.

700
00:58:46,859 --> 00:58:50,135
Then I ' ll explain that we' re gonna be
married before the week is out,

701
00:58:50,659 --> 00:58:52,218
therefore you should stay on at Wykwyn.

702
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,654
That I can't bear to
have you out of my sight.

703
00:58:54,819 --> 00:58:56,969
He also admires wholesome animal lust.

704
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:00,734
We 'll be married just
as soon as the law allows.

705
00:59:00,899 --> 00:59:03,696
We 'll catch an outbound boat.
Where do you want to go?

706
00:59:03,858 --> 00:59:07,010
- You ever been to the South Seas?
- What are you trying to pull?

707
00:59:08,059 --> 00:59:10,334
I 'm trying to pull... a proposal.

708
00:59:10,859 --> 00:59:12,577
Let's see, how shall I phrase it?

709
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,813
- How ' bout: Will you be mine?
- You're crazy!

710
00:59:15,979 --> 00:59:19,891
- You're out of your mind!
- That's a possibility.

711
00:59:20,058 --> 00:59:22,289
The name. Marnie. Yes, I'll just go on
calling you Marnie.

712
00:59:22,459 --> 00:59:26,053
That's easily explained. Pet name.
But the Taylor.

713
00:59:27,018 --> 00:59:29,977
We'll just have to marry you off
as Mary Taylor. It's perfectly legal.

714
00:59:30,139 --> 00:59:33,370
You can sign yourself Minnie Q Mouse
on a marriage licence,

715
00:59:33,539 --> 00:59:34,937
you're still legally married.

716
00:59:35,099 --> 00:59:36,850
But you know what I am.

717
00:59:37,018 --> 00:59:39,771
I ' m Minnie Q Thief!
I 'm - I 'm a thief and a liar!

718
00:59:39,938 --> 00:59:44,490
It seems to be my misfortune to have
fallen in love with a thief and a liar.

719
00:59:45,338 --> 00:59:47,568
In love?

720
00:59:48,458 --> 00:59:50,814
Oh, Mark, if you love me,
you'll let me go.

721
00:59:51,979 --> 00:59:54,413
Just let me go, Mark, please.

722
00:59:54,898 --> 00:59:56,853
Mark, you don't know me.

723
00:59:59,777 --> 01:00:03,929
Listen to me, Mark. I am not like
other people. I know what I am!

724
01:00:04,097 --> 01:00:05,450
I doubt that you do, Marnie.

725
01:00:05,617 --> 01:00:08,529
We'll just have to deal with
whatever it is that you are.

726
01:00:09,337 --> 01:00:11,487
Whatever you are, I love you.

727
01:00:12,938 --> 01:00:15,496
It's horrible, I know.
But I do love you.

728
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:18,566
You don't love me.

729
01:00:18,736 --> 01:00:21,046
I'm just something you've caught!

730
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:23,572
You think I'm some kind
of animal you've trapped.

731
01:00:24,137 --> 01:00:25,616
That's right, you are.

732
01:00:25,776 --> 01:00:29,213
And I've caught something
really wild this time, haven't I?

733
01:00:29,377 --> 01:00:32,448
I've tracked you and caught you,
and by God, I'm gonna keep you!

734
01:00:33,016 --> 01:00:34,496
Oh, and, Marnie, when we get home,

735
01:00:34,657 --> 01:00:37,534
no cute ideas about absconding
with the Wykwyn silver.

736
01:00:38,016 --> 01:00:39,734
Just get a grip on yourself
for one short week

737
01:00:39,896 --> 01:00:42,206
and after that
you can take legal possession.

738
01:00:42,377 --> 01:00:45,892
Like you?
Like you take legal possession?

739
01:00:47,496 --> 01:00:48,816
Yes, if you want to put it that way.

740
01:00:49,817 --> 01:00:52,410
Somebody's gotta take on the
responsibility for you, Marnie.

741
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:56,214
And it narrows down to a choice of
me or the police, ol' girl.

742
01:01:11,416 --> 01:01:13,850
- Indispensable.
- (Rutland Chuckling)

743
01:01:14,016 --> 01:01:16,849
Ah, Cousin Bob, I almost forgot.
Do you have the old necessary?

744
01:01:17,016 --> 01:01:18,210
Have fun, my dear.

745
01:01:18,296 --> 01:01:20,093
Traveller's checks in this.
Letter of credit in this.

746
01:01:20,256 --> 01:01:24,407
Thanks, old man. Will you see about
having my car picked up at the airport?

747
01:01:24,575 --> 01:01:27,566
Bob is our banking cousin.
A very handy fellow.

748
01:01:30,974 --> 01:01:33,045
Take care, Lil.

749
01:01:33,215 --> 01:01:35,012
We'll send you a noble savage.

750
01:01:35,175 --> 01:01:36,733
- Goodbye, Dad.
- Bye, Mark.

751
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:39,693
Thank you, Dr Gillian. Without you
it wouldn't have been legal.

752
01:01:39,855 --> 01:01:41,766
It's been a pleasure.

753
01:01:47,735 --> 01:01:51,647
(Rutland) Let's go finish the champagne
and cake before they spirit it away.

754
01:01:51,934 --> 01:01:55,484
Really splendid cake, you know?
I attended to that myself.

755
01:01:55,655 --> 01:01:57,327
I've made the acquaintance
of one of those

756
01:01:57,495 --> 01:01:58,893
excellent Horn and Hardart executives.

757
01:01:59,054 --> 01:02:02,286
That engagement ring must
have been at least five carats.

758
01:02:02,975 --> 01:02:06,853
Six and a half.
Blue-white. Perfect stone.

759
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:09,209
His mother left
perfectly good jewellery.

760
01:02:09,374 --> 01:02:11,046
It's just sitting there at the bank.

761
01:02:11,214 --> 01:02:14,843
He wanted her to have something
that had never belonged to anyone else.

762
01:02:15,014 --> 01:02:17,245
But six and a half carats!

763
01:02:18,215 --> 01:02:20,409
And cashing in a bond
to pay for a ring.

764
01:02:20,574 --> 01:02:22,768
But he didn't pay for it.
He charged it.

765
01:02:22,973 --> 01:02:24,453
I helped him pick it out.

766
01:02:24,614 --> 01:02:28,163
It cost $42,000... plus tax.

767
01:02:28,854 --> 01:02:31,527
Did you say $42,000?

768
01:02:31,694 --> 01:02:34,367
The man's deranged.

769
01:02:34,774 --> 01:02:36,810
You know what he did to me
last Saturday?

770
01:02:36,974 --> 01:02:41,125
He came out to the club
waving a check for $7,000,

771
01:02:41,293 --> 01:02:44,602
and insisted that I break up
my golf game, go in and open the bank,

772
01:02:44,772 --> 01:02:46,604
and hand over to him $7,000.

773
01:02:46,893 --> 01:02:48,884
Then he drew out -

774
01:02:49,053 --> 01:02:53,171
Well, let ' s just say, enough to pay for
this trip, plus the letter of credit.

775
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:56,131
He cashed that very nice bond
against my advice,

776
01:02:56,293 --> 01:02:58,283
made me get him the money.

777
01:02:58,732 --> 01:03:01,007
Ten thousand in small bills.
And when I asked him

778
01:03:01,172 --> 01:03:03,891
why he wanted $10,000
in small bills, he said,

779
01:03:04,052 --> 01:03:09,286
"Well, old man, I'm being blackmailed,
and they specified small bills. "

780
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:12,091
I know that most people
find Mark's humour charming.

781
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:16,888
I do not. There is nothing charming
about running through -

782
01:03:19,252 --> 01:03:21,640
Including the unpaid bill for a ring,

783
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:25,481
approximately $70,000 in one week.

784
01:03:25,652 --> 01:03:29,327
A $6,000 or $7,000
South Seas honeymoon,

785
01:03:29,493 --> 01:03:32,450
conservatively speaking,
and a $42,000 ring.

786
01:03:33,092 --> 01:03:35,480
All that money spent to celebrate what?

787
01:03:35,651 --> 01:03:38,086
This meager, furtive little wedding?

788
01:03:38,972 --> 01:03:41,849
He didn't even ask Mother.

789
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:32,723
"Pay off Strutt."

790
01:04:33,809 --> 01:04:35,687
Strutt.

791
01:05:11,289 --> 01:05:12,962
Booze?

792
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:15,400
Shall I, uh, fix you a drink?

793
01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:23,684
(Knocking)

794
01:05:24,369 --> 01:05:27,042
Would you like some bourbon
to brush your teeth?

795
01:05:27,209 --> 01:05:28,562
(Marnie) No, thank you.

796
01:05:31,408 --> 01:05:34,445
Contrary to the movies
and the Ladies Home Journal,

797
01:05:34,808 --> 01:05:37,845
the battleground of marriage
is not, I repeat, not,

798
01:05:38,048 --> 01:05:40,039
the... bedroom.

799
01:05:42,369 --> 01:05:43,801
The real field of battle is the bath.

800
01:05:43,968 --> 01:05:46,162
It is in the bath and for the bath,

801
01:05:46,327 --> 01:05:48,238
that the lines are drawn
and no quarter given.

802
01:05:49,128 --> 01:05:52,598
It seems to me, we are getting off
to a dangerously poor start, darling.

803
01:05:52,768 --> 01:05:55,440
You've been in the bathroom
exactly 47 minutes.

804
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:00,116
You can have the bath now.

805
01:06:00,288 --> 01:06:02,482
Thank you.

806
01:06:03,768 --> 01:06:07,237
You're very sexy
with your face clean.

807
01:06:08,887 --> 01:06:10,799
Marnie, come here.

808
01:06:21,127 --> 01:06:23,277
Sit down.

809
01:06:35,568 --> 01:06:37,558
I... can't! I can't! I can't!

810
01:06:38,766 --> 01:06:40,166
For God's sake, Marnie!

811
01:06:42,287 --> 01:06:46,325
I can't stand it! I'll die!
If you touch me again, I'll die!

812
01:06:49,407 --> 01:06:54,434
I promise I won't touch you. Just
get out of that damn corner, please.

813
01:06:57,005 --> 01:06:59,599
Now, suppose you tell me
what this is all about.

814
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:01,118
Is it your own little way of saying

815
01:07:01,285 --> 01:07:02,958
you don't find me particularly
attractive?

816
01:07:03,126 --> 01:07:05,560
I told you not to marry me.
I told you!

817
01:07:05,726 --> 01:07:07,716
Oh, God, why couldn't
you have just let me go?

818
01:07:08,085 --> 01:07:09,314
Marnie.

819
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:13,439
- Don't! Please, don't!
- Let me fix you a drink.

820
01:07:13,606 --> 01:07:15,482
- I don't want a drink.
- A brandy -

821
01:07:15,645 --> 01:07:17,761
I don't want it. Just leave me alone!

822
01:07:17,925 --> 01:07:20,234
Not till I find out what's the matter,
and some way to help.

823
01:07:20,405 --> 01:07:23,955
The only way you can help me
is to leave me alone!

824
01:07:24,126 --> 01:07:28,437
Can't you understand? Isn't it clear?
I cannot bear to be handled!

825
01:07:29,485 --> 01:07:32,125
- By anybody? Or just me?
- You. Men.

826
01:07:34,965 --> 01:07:36,159
Really?

827
01:07:37,085 --> 01:07:40,873
You didn't seem to mind
at my office that day, or at the stables.

828
01:07:41,045 --> 01:07:43,081
And all this last week
I've handled you.

829
01:07:43,245 --> 01:07:45,281
I've kissed you many times.

830
01:07:45,966 --> 01:07:49,162
Why didn't you break out into a cold
sweat and back into a corner then?

831
01:07:49,325 --> 01:07:54,160
- I thought I could stand it if I had to.
- I see.

832
01:07:54,325 --> 01:07:56,316
Have you always felt like this?

833
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:59,157
- Always, yes!
- Why? What happened to you?

834
01:07:59,404 --> 01:08:02,397
Happened? Nothing.
Nothing happened to me.

835
01:08:02,565 --> 01:08:04,795
I just never wanted anybody
to touch me!

836
01:08:06,045 --> 01:08:07,637
You ever tried to talk about it,

837
01:08:07,806 --> 01:08:09,920
to a doctor or somebody
who could help you?

838
01:08:10,084 --> 01:08:12,075
No, why should I?
I didn't want to get married.

839
01:08:12,804 --> 01:08:14,920
It's degrading. It's animal!

840
01:08:15,245 --> 01:08:16,997
Anyway, I was doing alright
the way I was.

841
01:08:17,164 --> 01:08:20,792
I wouldn't say that. If I hadn't caught
you, you'd have gone on stealing.

842
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:25,003
- No. No I wouldn't
- Yes, you would, again and again.

843
01:08:25,164 --> 01:08:28,280
Eventually, you would've
got caught by somebody.

844
01:08:28,443 --> 01:08:30,240
You're such a tempting little thing.

845
01:08:30,403 --> 01:08:34,078
Some other sexual blackmailer
would've got his hands on you.

846
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:37,919
The chances of it being someone as
permissive as me are pretty remote.

847
01:08:38,084 --> 01:08:40,472
Sooner or later,
you'd have gone to jail.

848
01:08:40,803 --> 01:08:44,638
Or been cornered in an office by some
old bull of a businessman

849
01:08:44,804 --> 01:08:46,919
who was out to take what he figured
was coming to him.

850
01:08:47,083 --> 01:08:48,960
You'd probably have got him and jail.

851
01:08:49,123 --> 01:08:52,513
So I wouldn't say you were
doing alright, Marnie.

852
01:08:52,683 --> 01:08:56,471
- I'd say you needed help.
- I don't need your help.

853
01:08:57,643 --> 01:09:01,079
I don't think you're capable
of judging what you need.

854
01:09:01,243 --> 01:09:05,599
What you do need, I expect,
is a psychiatrist.

855
01:09:06,162 --> 01:09:07,312
Oh... men!

856
01:09:07,723 --> 01:09:11,920
Say "no thanks to one", and bingo,
you're a candidate for the funny farm.

857
01:09:12,082 --> 01:09:14,392
It would be hilarious
if it weren't pathetic.

858
01:09:16,403 --> 01:09:19,281
Let's try to get some rest, hm?
We'll talk this out tomorrow.

859
01:09:19,443 --> 01:09:22,594
There's nothing to talk out.
I've told you how I feel.

860
01:09:22,763 --> 01:09:26,516
I'll feel the same way tomorrow,
and the day after, and the day after that!

861
01:09:27,202 --> 01:09:30,798
Alright, Marnie. We won't talk about it
until you want to.

862
01:09:30,962 --> 01:09:34,272
But we're gonna be on this damn boat
for many days and nights.

863
01:09:35,042 --> 01:09:37,841
Let's drop this for the present
and try to get through this

864
01:09:38,003 --> 01:09:40,516
bloody honeymoon cruise with
as much grace as possible.

865
01:09:40,682 --> 01:09:44,390
Let's try at least to be...
kind to each other.

866
01:09:44,841 --> 01:09:46,479
Oh. Kind!

867
01:09:47,241 --> 01:09:50,039
Alright, if that's too much,
I'll be kind to you,

868
01:09:50,201 --> 01:09:53,318
- and you'll be polite to me -
- You won't -

869
01:09:56,081 --> 01:09:58,073
I won't.

870
01:09:59,721 --> 01:10:01,712
I give you my word.

871
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:06,356
Now, let's try to get
some rest, hm? How 'bout it?

872
01:10:07,201 --> 01:10:11,558
You in your bed over there, and me,
light years away in mine here.

873
01:10:13,281 --> 01:10:14,600
Thank you.

874
01:10:15,681 --> 01:10:20,038
I think I'd like to stay out here
for a while, but... thank you.

875
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:35,354
You're gonna bring a little pazazz
down to the old farm, my dear.

876
01:10:35,521 --> 01:10:38,796
I noticed before we left,
Dad was pulling out his silk shirts.

877
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,315
What do you mean,
what will I do with myself?

878
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,596
I had of course assumed
I would become a society hostess.

879
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,673
In Africa, in Kenya, there's quite
a beautiful flower.

880
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:50,639
It's coral coloured with
little green-tipped blossoms,

881
01:10:50,801 --> 01:10:53,394
rather like a hyacinth.

882
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:56,199
If you reach out to touch it,

883
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:59,432
you'd discover that the flower
was not a flower at all,

884
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:04,275
but a design made up of hundreds
of tiny insects called Fattid bugs.

885
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:06,634
They escape the eyes of hungry birds

886
01:11:06,799 --> 01:11:09,597
by living and dying
in the shape of a flower.

887
01:11:23,799 --> 01:11:27,348
I'll close the door, if you don't mind.
The light bothers me.

888
01:11:31,638 --> 01:11:34,073
Hm, what's that, dear?
The light? Oh, yes, of course.

889
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:37,753
You've been an absolute darling
about my sitting up reading so late.

890
01:11:37,958 --> 01:11:40,553
I'm boning up on marine life

891
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:43,074
since entomology doesn't seem
to be your subject,

892
01:11:43,239 --> 01:11:46,310
and I 'm eager to find a subject,
Marnie, any subject.

893
01:11:47,398 --> 01:11:49,673
Alright. Here's a subject.

894
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:54,867
How long? How long do we have to stay
on this boat, this trip?

895
01:11:55,038 --> 01:11:57,108
How long before we can go back?

896
01:11:57,278 --> 01:12:00,156
Why, Mrs Rutland!
Can you be suggesting

897
01:12:00,318 --> 01:12:02,992
that these halcyon
honeymoon days and nights,

898
01:12:03,159 --> 01:12:06,309
just the two of us alone
together... should ever end?

899
01:12:13,918 --> 01:12:16,226
If you don't mind,
I'd like to go to bed.

900
01:12:16,437 --> 01:12:18,827
I've told you the light
from the sitting room bothers me.

901
01:12:19,038 --> 01:12:21,950
We certainly can't have anything
bothering you, can we?

902
01:12:22,118 --> 01:12:23,107
(Door Slams)

903
01:12:23,398 --> 01:12:26,389
If you don't want to go
to bed, please get out.

904
01:12:27,556 --> 01:12:29,433
But I do want to go to bed, Marnie.

905
01:12:30,556 --> 01:12:31,990
I very much want to go to bed.

906
01:12:32,917 --> 01:12:34,908
(Screams) No!

907
01:12:36,196 --> 01:12:37,754
(Gasps)

908
01:12:44,236 --> 01:12:46,545
I'm sorry, Marnie.

909
01:14:09,114 --> 01:14:11,548
(Door Closes)

910
01:15:57,272 --> 01:15:59,183
(Coughs)

911
01:16:05,312 --> 01:16:07,108
Why the hell
didn't you jump over the side?

912
01:16:08,111 --> 01:16:12,025
The idea was to kill myself,
not feed the damn fish.

913
01:16:20,032 --> 01:16:21,385
Mark!

914
01:16:21,672 --> 01:16:25,424
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
Was Fiji grisly?

915
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:28,981
We didn't get to Fiji. We jumped ship
in Honolulu and flew back.

916
01:16:29,151 --> 01:16:32,825
We had to take a cab from the airport.
We're tired and grimy.

917
01:16:32,990 --> 01:16:35,061
Remember when you were six?
You wanted to go to New York.

918
01:16:35,231 --> 01:16:37,107
I warned you then that
travelling was a nasty business.

919
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:39,420
You poor thing.
You must be exhausted.

920
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:41,980
I think that we'll go after the
first drink and pop up to bed.

921
01:16:42,151 --> 01:16:45,221
The travel lecture will
have to wait for morning.

922
01:16:45,389 --> 01:16:47,539
- Where's the rest of your luggage?
- A t the airport.

923
01:16:47,709 --> 01:16:52,101
I ' ll have breakfast with you in the
morning, dad. See you then, Lil.

924
01:17:00,709 --> 01:17:05,066
Come on, Marnie. It's not exactly
a house of correction, you know.

925
01:17:49,029 --> 01:17:50,144
Look, Marnie,

926
01:17:50,309 --> 01:17:54,269
for the present all we've got is the
facade, and we 've got to live it.

927
01:17:55,109 --> 01:17:57,702
Dad has breakfast downstairs
at 8::30 every morning.

928
01:17:57,868 --> 01:18:01,019
I always join him. So, naturally,
as you want to be with me as -

929
01:18:08,788 --> 01:18:10,187
This is the drill, dear.

930
01:18:10,348 --> 01:18:14,784
Wife follows husband to front door.
Gives and or gets a kiss.

931
01:18:14,947 --> 01:18:17,666
Stands pensively as he drives away.

932
01:18:17,827 --> 01:18:20,739
Oh, a wistful little wave is optional.

933
01:18:32,587 --> 01:18:35,624
Mark, are you... going to the office?

934
01:18:35,787 --> 01:18:38,984
On the first day back after our
honeymoon? How indelicate.

935
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:43,060
No, I'm going down the road
on a little errand. I'll see you later.

936
01:18:43,227 --> 01:18:46,856
Mark, I, um...
I don't have any money.

937
01:18:47,427 --> 01:18:51,385
I'm sorry, Marnie. I'll have Bob
make out an account for you.

938
01:18:51,906 --> 01:18:56,934
It won't be much for a while. You see,
I've had a lot of heavy expenses.

939
01:18:57,506 --> 01:18:59,462
And you might as well know
I 've paid off Strutt.

940
01:18:59,627 --> 01:19:01,379
Anonymously, of course.

941
01:19:01,627 --> 01:19:04,505
- (Marnie) But that's all over!
- So?

942
01:19:04,667 --> 01:19:07,659
(Marnie) So, you've given away $10,000,

943
01:19:07,827 --> 01:19:09,544
so you' re a prize fool!

944
01:19:09,706 --> 01:19:12,584
Possibly, but they don't put
you in jail for being a fool.

945
01:19:12,746 --> 01:19:15,022
I'm not the one the cops are after.
Not yet.

946
01:19:15,187 --> 01:19:17,700
And I don't intend to be.
Not if I can prevent it.

947
01:19:17,866 --> 01:19:21,097
Perhaps you, madam, but not me.

948
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:55,378
(Phone Dialling)

949
01:20:12,144 --> 01:20:14,136
Hello, Mama?

950
01:20:14,425 --> 01:20:17,098
No, I 'm alright.
I 'm perfectly alright now.

951
01:20:17,305 --> 01:20:21,537
I had a bad case of the flu
and just didn't feel up to writing.

952
01:20:21,705 --> 01:20:24,616
I couldn't. I had laryngitis too.

953
01:20:24,784 --> 01:20:28,300
Yes, I am still a little hoarse.

954
01:20:29,185 --> 01:20:30,458
Look, Mama, I can't talk long.

955
01:20:30,624 --> 01:20:35,540
I just called to tell you that I'm
alright and I'll send some money soon.

956
01:20:35,705 --> 01:20:38,378
No, I can't. I don't know when
I'll get to Baltimore.

957
01:20:38,545 --> 01:20:42,219
But not for a few weeks anyway.
But I'll talk to you soon.

958
01:20:42,384 --> 01:20:47,776
If you need anything, write to me
at the post office box in Philadelphia.

959
01:20:47,943 --> 01:20:50,332
I've got to go now, Mama.

960
01:20:50,503 --> 01:20:53,381
Goodbye. Goodbye, Mama.

961
01:21:06,143 --> 01:21:08,862
(Horn Honking)

962
01:21:32,582 --> 01:21:36,700
Oh, Forio! Oh, beauty!

963
01:22:07,182 --> 01:22:09,376
Well, she said she could ride a little.

964
01:22:11,182 --> 01:22:13,136
- Mark?
- Hm?

965
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:16,019
Mark, listen. I'm a good fighter
if you need me.

966
01:22:17,341 --> 01:22:19,616
I mean, if you are in
some kind of trouble.

967
01:22:19,781 --> 01:22:23,090
I have absolutely no scruples.
I'd lie to the police or anything.

968
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:25,092
What on earth are you talking about?

969
01:22:25,901 --> 01:22:28,938
I heard you and Marnie
this morning right out here.

970
01:22:29,101 --> 01:22:31,773
- Heard?
- OK, I eavesdropped.

971
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:35,459
We should've made you go to college
or come out or something.

972
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:39,580
- I can see that now.
- Don't patronise me, Mark.

973
01:22:39,661 --> 01:22:43,209
That Mary-Marnie, brown-haired blonde
you married so fast and sneaky

974
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:45,291
and tried to hustle off
to the South Pacific!

975
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:49,976
I didn't have to overhear stuff about
your not intending to go to jail too,

976
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:51,937
to know that
you're in some sort of fix.

977
01:22:53,539 --> 01:22:56,418
- Please, Mark, will you let me help?
- Alright, you can help.

978
01:22:56,580 --> 01:23:00,858
You can help by being nice to Marnie.
She needs a friend.

979
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:03,932
I always thought that a girl's
best friend was her mother.

980
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:08,812
Poor old Mark.
Is her mother that ghastly?

981
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:12,575
When the in-laws are so grim,
you don't invite them to the wedding.

982
01:23:12,740 --> 01:23:16,415
The usual excuse is poor health
or the strain of the trip, you know?

983
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:18,810
But to claim they're dead,
now, come on!

984
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:22,856
Alright, Lil, what is it you're up to?
Out with it.

985
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:26,932
Me? I'm just offering you my services.

986
01:23:27,099 --> 01:23:30,011
Guerrilla fighter, perjurer,
intelligence agent.

987
01:23:30,179 --> 01:23:33,615
- Alright, intelligence agent.
- Baltimore.

988
01:23:33,779 --> 01:23:35,769
There's a mother in Baltimore.

989
01:23:35,938 --> 01:23:37,576
Marnie made
a phone call this morning.

990
01:23:37,738 --> 01:23:40,299
She said she hadn't been able to write
because she 'd had the flu.

991
01:23:40,699 --> 01:23:44,452
She didn 't know when she 'd go to
Baltimore, but she 'd send money.

992
01:23:44,618 --> 01:23:48,611
She said to go on writing to her
at the same post office box.

993
01:23:51,258 --> 01:23:54,296
I listened through the library door.

994
01:23:55,458 --> 01:23:59,133
She's having you on, Lil.
It's some sort of gag.

995
01:23:59,298 --> 01:24:01,608
You've been ratty. She's set out
to teach you some manners.

996
01:24:02,138 --> 01:24:04,857
- You're being had, Lil.
- You can say that again!

997
01:24:05,018 --> 01:24:08,533
But I don't want to say it again.
I don't want to have to say it again.

998
01:24:08,698 --> 01:24:10,689
Alright, Mark.

999
01:24:11,818 --> 01:24:13,410
You seem to be growing up, Lil.

1000
01:24:13,778 --> 01:24:16,531
I expect what we should do
is find you some young man.

1001
01:24:16,698 --> 01:24:19,735
- What's your type?
- I was waiting for you.

1002
01:24:20,457 --> 01:24:22,528
I'm queer for liars.

1003
01:24:22,698 --> 01:24:25,815
Really? Well, what sort
of liar do you fancy?

1004
01:24:25,977 --> 01:24:29,414
We could run an ad. Do you prefer
an indoor liar or an outdoor liar?

1005
01:24:29,578 --> 01:24:31,091
Playboy or Field and Stream?

1006
01:24:41,537 --> 01:24:45,167
Anybody home? Hi! Where's Marnie?

1007
01:24:45,538 --> 01:24:49,052
She and Dad are still out riding.
He is taking her over the hunt country.

1008
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:51,652
Big deal! She's going
to ride with the hunt.

1009
01:24:51,818 --> 01:24:53,968
And Dad's throwing some kind of bash
to introduce her.

1010
01:24:55,098 --> 01:24:58,930
- Has a long-distance call come in?
- No. Not that I know of.

1011
01:24:59,096 --> 01:25:01,815
- (Phone Ringing)
- I'll get it.

1012
01:25:03,976 --> 01:25:06,127
(Mark) Hello. Yes.

1013
01:25:06,297 --> 01:25:07,695
Hold on, I want to take it
on another phone.

1014
01:25:09,176 --> 01:25:11,087
I ' ll take it upstairs.
Hang up as soon as I get it.

1015
01:25:14,177 --> 01:25:17,804
Uh, Lil, you will hang up, won't you?

1016
01:25:38,615 --> 01:25:40,014
OK, Lil.

1017
01:25:40,335 --> 01:25:42,896
Hello? Yes I ' ll talk to him now.

1018
01:25:43,416 --> 01:25:46,453
Hello, Mr Boyle. Found anything
interesting down there?

1019
01:25:46,616 --> 01:25:49,767
Hold on. Let me get a pencil.
OK, ready.

1020
01:25:51,336 --> 01:25:54,532
Bernice Edgar.

1021
01:25:54,695 --> 01:26:00,611
1 1 6 Van Buren Street, Baltimore.

1022
01:26:00,775 --> 01:26:02,174
Yeah, I got that. Go on.

1023
01:26:05,736 --> 01:26:07,772
Wait a minute!

1024
01:26:07,936 --> 01:26:09,970
You say she killed him?

1025
01:26:10,134 --> 01:26:12,854
Well, when was that?

1026
01:26:13,495 --> 01:26:16,055
That means the little girl must've been
about five, is that right?

1027
01:26:16,215 --> 01:26:19,172
Well, what happened to her?
No, not the woman. The child.

1028
01:26:19,334 --> 01:26:21,131
I want to know what happened
to the little girl, the daughter.

1029
01:26:25,614 --> 01:26:28,129
No, no! Stay on there.
Get me anything else you can.

1030
01:26:28,294 --> 01:26:30,443
Look, have photostats made
of all the court records.

1031
01:26:30,613 --> 01:26:33,525
Send them to me immediately.
Yes, to my office. Registered.

1032
01:26:33,694 --> 01:26:36,208
You're doing an
excellent job, Mr Boyle.

1033
01:26:36,894 --> 01:26:38,725
(Lil) Did you have a good ride?

1034
01:26:38,934 --> 01:26:42,722
Yeah. Ah, Mr Boyle,
get the photostats to me. Yes.

1035
01:26:42,894 --> 01:26:46,364
And call me the minute
you get anything further on the child.

1036
01:26:46,533 --> 01:26:49,207
Thank you.
I'll expect to hear from you.

1037
01:26:49,374 --> 01:26:51,409
Goodbye.

1038
01:27:02,333 --> 01:27:04,847
(Tapping)

1039
01:27:05,013 --> 01:27:08,847
- (Tapping Continues)
- Mama? Oh, Mama, don't cry.

1040
01:27:09,773 --> 01:27:11,525
Please don't cry, Mama.

1041
01:27:12,973 --> 01:27:16,682
- (Tapping)
- No! No!

1042
01:27:17,413 --> 01:27:19,405
Mama?

1043
01:27:19,934 --> 01:27:22,606
Mama, don't cry.

1044
01:27:23,652 --> 01:27:25,848
- (Tapping Continues)
- No!

1045
01:27:26,813 --> 01:27:30,203
Mama? Mama?

1046
01:27:32,373 --> 01:27:34,762
- (Knocking At Door)
- Mama?

1047
01:27:34,933 --> 01:27:36,810
- Mama?
- Wake up, Marnie.

1048
01:27:37,053 --> 01:27:38,486
- Mama?
- Marnie?

1049
01:27:40,174 --> 01:27:44,210
Mama? Oh, don't hurt my mama.

1050
01:27:45,131 --> 01:27:48,807
- Marnie.
- Please don't hurt my mama!

1051
01:27:54,692 --> 01:27:57,809
- Marnie.
- (Gasps) Oh, don't, don't!

1052
01:28:00,091 --> 01:28:02,889
- What's going on?
- She's having a nightmare.

1053
01:28:03,651 --> 01:28:07,564
- No, Mama. Mama?
- Marnie, wake up, it's just a nightmare.

1054
01:28:12,651 --> 01:28:15,643
- She's alright.
- I'm cold.

1055
01:28:17,892 --> 01:28:20,883
That's supposed to be your department,
isn't it, ol' boy?

1056
01:28:21,691 --> 01:28:23,807
Good night, all.

1057
01:28:39,211 --> 01:28:42,567
- Let me get you a brandy.
- Uh-uh.

1058
01:28:43,210 --> 01:28:45,805
Where did you get these things?

1059
01:28:47,251 --> 01:28:49,765
I can get more anytime I want them.

1060
01:28:49,931 --> 01:28:53,288
Yeah, of course you can. You can
also find, at your convenience,

1061
01:28:53,451 --> 01:28:56,442
heights, ropes, ovens,
even plastic bags.

1062
01:28:56,610 --> 01:28:58,680
The world's full of alternatives.

1063
01:28:59,330 --> 01:29:01,606
I'd like to go back to sleep now.

1064
01:29:01,771 --> 01:29:05,967
Why? Your sleep seems even less
agreeable than your waking hours.

1065
01:29:06,969 --> 01:29:09,200
That, uh, dream.

1066
01:29:09,370 --> 01:29:12,760
You know, you've had it before.

1067
01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:15,124
Is it about something that
really happened to you?

1068
01:29:15,289 --> 01:29:19,202
No, I... I don't know
what it means. Nothing.

1069
01:29:20,169 --> 01:29:23,719
Well, it's about your mother.
She wants you to get up.

1070
01:29:24,369 --> 01:29:27,645
Yes, but first there
are the three taps.

1071
01:29:29,369 --> 01:29:33,362
And then she says, "Get up, Marnie.
You have to get up now!"

1072
01:29:33,529 --> 01:29:36,600
But I don't want to. If I -

1073
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:39,522
If I get up, I'll be cold
and they'll hurt her!

1074
01:29:40,249 --> 01:29:42,809
Who? Who'll hurt her?

1075
01:29:42,969 --> 01:29:46,325
Th-Th- Them!

1076
01:29:46,489 --> 01:29:48,764
I don't know! I don't know!

1077
01:29:48,929 --> 01:29:51,682
But I hear the noises.
I'm cold and I hear the noises!

1078
01:29:52,009 --> 01:29:54,762
What noises? What are they like?

1079
01:30:00,089 --> 01:30:02,080
Who makes them?

1080
01:30:08,968 --> 01:30:11,163
You Freud, me Jane?

1081
01:30:14,889 --> 01:30:18,961
If you won't see an analyst,
why don't you try to help yourself?

1082
01:30:19,808 --> 01:30:23,688
But that's why I'm in this trap,
from trying to help myself.

1083
01:30:23,849 --> 01:30:25,885
Just leave me alone, Mark, please.

1084
01:30:26,048 --> 01:30:27,480
If I give you some books,
will you read them?

1085
01:30:29,287 --> 01:30:31,881
Your new homework?
Frigidity In Women?

1086
01:30:32,047 --> 01:30:34,561
The Psychopathic Delinquent
and Criminal?

1087
01:30:34,727 --> 01:30:38,242
- Have you read them?
- I don't need to read that muck

1088
01:30:38,407 --> 01:30:42,480
to know that women are stupid and
feeble and that men are filthy pigs!

1089
01:30:45,447 --> 01:30:49,678
In case you didn't recognise it,
that was a rejection.

1090
01:30:49,846 --> 01:30:53,442
I want you to read them.
Start with The Undiscovered Self.

1091
01:30:53,687 --> 01:30:57,235
Oh, for God's sake, Mark,
leave me alone! I'm tired!

1092
01:30:59,207 --> 01:31:01,675
Why can't you just leave me alone?

1093
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:05,317
Because I think
you're sick, ol' dear.

1094
01:31:07,007 --> 01:31:08,997
I'm sick?

1095
01:31:09,886 --> 01:31:12,526
Well, take a look
at yourself, ol' dear.

1096
01:31:12,687 --> 01:31:16,202
You're so hot to play
Mental Health Week, what about you?

1097
01:31:16,527 --> 01:31:21,520
Talk about dream worlds. You've got
a pathological fix on a woman,

1098
01:31:21,686 --> 01:31:25,725
who's not only an admitted criminal
but who screams if you come near her!

1099
01:31:28,606 --> 01:31:31,200
So what about your dreams, Daddy dear?

1100
01:31:31,966 --> 01:31:33,718
I never said I was perfect.

1101
01:31:35,247 --> 01:31:37,761
That was quite a speech.
It encourages me to believe

1102
01:31:37,927 --> 01:31:40,120
that you have leafed through
one or two books.

1103
01:31:40,285 --> 01:31:42,402
Which one did you find
the most interesting?

1104
01:31:44,926 --> 01:31:47,679
You're really dying
to play doctor, aren't you?

1105
01:31:49,566 --> 01:31:53,558
OK, I'm a big movie fan.
I know the games.

1106
01:31:53,725 --> 01:31:56,001
Come on. Let's play.

1107
01:31:56,166 --> 01:31:58,997
Shall I start with dreams
or should we free-associate?

1108
01:32:00,364 --> 01:32:04,358
Oh, Doctor, I'll bet you're
just dying to free-associate.

1109
01:32:05,445 --> 01:32:08,323
Alright now, you give me a word
and I ' ll give you an association.

1110
01:32:08,485 --> 01:32:12,558
You know, like: needles, pins;
when a man marries, trouble begins.

1111
01:32:12,725 --> 01:32:14,716
You ready?

1112
01:32:16,644 --> 01:32:20,159
Well, come on! I thought you wanted
to play doctor, so let's play!

1113
01:32:21,444 --> 01:32:25,563
- Water.
- Bath. Soap. Cleanse.

1114
01:32:25,725 --> 01:32:27,556
Pure. Made pure for me.

1115
01:32:27,725 --> 01:32:31,194
"And his tears
shall wash away thy sins

1116
01:32:31,364 --> 01:32:33,083
and make thee over again."

1117
01:32:33,605 --> 01:32:36,323
Baptists. Mother used to take me
to church. Twice on Sundays.

1118
01:32:39,204 --> 01:32:41,843
There. I'm not holding back
at all, am I?

1119
01:32:42,004 --> 01:32:44,313
You're bringing me out
marvellously, Doctor.

1120
01:32:44,484 --> 01:32:48,364
You'll have me up on my poor paralysed
little legs by the next scene. Go on.

1121
01:32:49,805 --> 01:32:52,716
- Air.
- Stare.

1122
01:32:52,883 --> 01:32:54,875
And that's what you do.

1123
01:32:56,524 --> 01:33:00,039
Stare and blare and say you care,
but you're unfair, you want a pair.

1124
01:33:01,123 --> 01:33:03,797
- Sex.
- Masculine, Feminine,

1125
01:33:03,964 --> 01:33:05,238
Adam and Eve, Jack and Jill.

1126
01:33:05,404 --> 01:33:08,077
I'll slap your filthy face
if you come near me again, Jack!

1127
01:33:08,244 --> 01:33:12,395
- Death.
- Me. Oh, listen, Mark -

1128
01:33:12,563 --> 01:33:13,757
- Needles.
- Pins.

1129
01:33:13,923 --> 01:33:14,958
- Black
- White

1130
01:33:15,242 --> 01:33:17,677
- Red!
- White. White!

1131
01:33:18,123 --> 01:33:22,400
It's alright, Marnie.
Darling, come here.

1132
01:33:22,562 --> 01:33:25,760
I won't let anything bad
happen to you. You're alright.

1133
01:33:26,563 --> 01:33:29,713
- You're alright.
- Oh, help me!

1134
01:33:30,522 --> 01:33:34,515
Help me. Oh, God,
somebody help me!

1135
01:33:40,803 --> 01:33:43,111
(Indistinct Chatter, Laughter)

1136
01:33:52,281 --> 01:33:54,671
(Doorbell Rings)

1137
01:34:03,402 --> 01:34:04,551
(Doorbell Rings)

1138
01:34:15,842 --> 01:34:18,310
(Doorbell Rings)

1139
01:34:22,882 --> 01:34:24,031
(Butler) What name, sir?

1140
01:34:24,202 --> 01:34:27,034
- Strutt.
- (Butler) Mr and Mrs Strutt.

1141
01:34:27,201 --> 01:34:30,433
Mr Strutt, Mrs Strutt? How do you do?

1142
01:34:30,602 --> 01:34:31,830
I 'm Lil Mainwaring,
Mark's sister-in-law.

1143
01:34:32,002 --> 01:34:34,720
- So good of you to come all this way.
- So nice of you to ask us.

1144
01:34:35,001 --> 01:34:38,880
Wait till tomorrow, Charlie.
Wait till you see her on a horse, eh?

1145
01:34:41,321 --> 01:34:44,356
- I'm not a bit nervous, Mark.
- You have no reason to be.

1146
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:48,639
You're unquestionably
the best-looking woman here.

1147
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:51,633
The best-dressed. The most intelligent.
And you're with me.

1148
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:56,349
- I think everyone's here.
- Well, Lil's scorekeeper.

1149
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:59,115
She has the list, made the table
arrangements and everything.

1150
01:34:59,281 --> 01:35:01,510
I'm afraid I wasn't much help,
but I'll do better next time.

1151
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:03,636
You're doing well enough.

1152
01:35:03,799 --> 01:35:08,191
I suppose we should keep... circulating.

1153
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:16,751
Why?

1154
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,036
- Why?
- I don't know. I swear I don't know.

1155
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:23,678
He wasn't invited here.
He's never been invited here.

1156
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:26,552
- It's Lil!
- Lil?

1157
01:35:26,959 --> 01:35:29,713
- She doesn't even know Strutt.
- It's Lil!

1158
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:32,348
Get me out of here please.

1159
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:34,272
It's too late. Here they come.

1160
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:36,635
Look, call his bluff. I'll back you up.

1161
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:40,949
- Oh, hello, Strutt. Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

1162
01:35:41,119 --> 01:35:43,793
- We haven't met. I am Mark Rutland.
- How do you do?

1163
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:46,234
- And this is my wife.
- How do you do?

1164
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:49,279
Well, this is a surprise.
I hadn't heard about your marriage.

1165
01:35:49,439 --> 01:35:52,352
You know, we all think
a great deal of your husband.

1166
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:59,037
We've been doing business with
the Rutlands... for a long time.

1167
01:36:03,918 --> 01:36:07,877
- I believe we've met before.
- I don't think so.

1168
01:36:10,398 --> 01:36:14,232
Think again... Mrs Rutland.

1169
01:36:14,398 --> 01:36:16,115
Are you just recently married?

1170
01:36:16,957 --> 01:36:19,027
Marnie and I have been married
for two months.

1171
01:36:19,197 --> 01:36:21,393
But we've known each other
quite well for four years.

1172
01:36:21,558 --> 01:36:24,118
Four years? Before Estelle...

1173
01:36:24,238 --> 01:36:25,637
Yes, didn't you know?

1174
01:36:29,718 --> 01:36:31,913
Darling, Betty seems
rather stranded over there.

1175
01:36:32,078 --> 01:36:34,797
You' ll have to excuse us for a few
moments, Mrs Strutt.

1176
01:36:34,958 --> 01:36:36,515
Oh, and Lil, would you see that

1177
01:36:36,677 --> 01:36:38,907
Mr and Mrs Strutt's glasses
are kept brimming?

1178
01:36:39,077 --> 01:36:40,226
That's a good girl.

1179
01:36:40,397 --> 01:36:43,310
- I'm going to be sick.
- You're not going to be sick.

1180
01:36:43,478 --> 01:36:45,787
You said we'd known each other
four years. Lil thought -

1181
01:36:45,958 --> 01:36:48,995
I don't give one infinitesimal damn
what Lil thought or thinks.

1182
01:36:49,158 --> 01:36:50,557
- Dinner is ready, sir.
- Good. Announce it.

1183
01:36:52,757 --> 01:36:54,713
Dinner is served.

1184
01:36:57,277 --> 01:37:00,508
Mr Strutt, my wife's taken a fancy
to you. Will you see her into dinner?

1185
01:37:12,357 --> 01:37:15,667
Five minutes! I 'm five minutes behind
you, and in those five minutes

1186
01:37:15,837 --> 01:37:18,305
you've got yourself up like a cat
burglar and packed for a world cruise.

1187
01:37:18,797 --> 01:37:20,549
I've got to get out of here,
and you've got to let me go.

1188
01:37:20,717 --> 01:37:23,026
That man is going to send me to jail.
You know he is!

1189
01:37:23,197 --> 01:37:25,073
What are you using
for guts this season?

1190
01:37:25,236 --> 01:37:26,272
Don't you understand?

1191
01:37:26,437 --> 01:37:28,346
He's coming back here tomorrow
and he's coming for my head!

1192
01:37:28,515 --> 01:37:30,506
We just won't give it to him.

1193
01:37:30,595 --> 01:37:33,429
Strutt may be throbbing away
with vengeful fantasies,

1194
01:37:33,596 --> 01:37:36,633
but the fact is he's a businessman,
he's in the business of doing business.

1195
01:37:36,796 --> 01:37:38,865
- So?
- So we try to do business.

1196
01:37:39,035 --> 01:37:40,867
The Rutland account
is one of the biggest he's got.

1197
01:37:41,036 --> 01:37:44,824
If he insists on acting like the swine
he is, then... and he'll lose others too.

1198
01:37:44,996 --> 01:37:47,635
I'll see to it, but first I'll see to
it that he understands I'll see to it.

1199
01:37:47,796 --> 01:37:50,946
You can keep him from prosecuting,
you can't keep him from talking.

1200
01:37:51,115 --> 01:37:53,754
I don't care if he outtalks every
Southern senator on Capitol Hill.

1201
01:37:53,915 --> 01:37:55,065
Well, I do. I care.

1202
01:37:55,236 --> 01:37:58,308
Darling, didn't your mother
ever tell you about sticks and stones?

1203
01:37:58,476 --> 01:38:02,264
Can't you understand there may be
other... things involved,

1204
01:38:02,436 --> 01:38:04,630
other people that I don't
want to hear about me?

1205
01:38:04,795 --> 01:38:05,830
Yes, I can understand,

1206
01:38:05,995 --> 01:38:09,590
but since you're the well-known
orphan child, who's to care?

1207
01:38:09,755 --> 01:38:11,154
The police, damn you.

1208
01:38:11,315 --> 01:38:13,749
What can the police do if we can stop
Strutt from prosecuting?

1209
01:38:13,955 --> 01:38:17,869
They can start investigating
other jobs. Other similar jobs.

1210
01:38:23,434 --> 01:38:25,391
- Well, that's something else again.
- Yes, it is.

1211
01:38:25,875 --> 01:38:28,105
How many? How many other jobs?

1212
01:38:31,114 --> 01:38:33,675
Tell me the truth, damn it! You've
nothing to gain by lying to me now!

1213
01:38:33,835 --> 01:38:35,871
- How many jobs have you pulled?
- Three.

1214
01:38:37,595 --> 01:38:41,303
- Try again.
- Four. Five counting Strutt.

1215
01:38:42,234 --> 01:38:44,031
Over how long a period?

1216
01:38:44,194 --> 01:38:46,186
Five years,
and that's the truth, I swear!

1217
01:38:47,355 --> 01:38:51,107
- Alright. How much? How much?
- Under $50,000.

1218
01:38:52,233 --> 01:38:53,633
What towns?

1219
01:38:53,794 --> 01:38:56,831
Buffalo, Detroit, Elizabeth, New Jersey
and New York.

1220
01:38:56,994 --> 01:38:59,302
Well, in New York and Philadelphia,

1221
01:38:59,473 --> 01:39:02,112
I ' ll be poor old Mark Rutland who lost
his head over a pretty girl.

1222
01:39:02,273 --> 01:39:04,787
In the others I'm just
an accessory after the fact

1223
01:39:04,953 --> 01:39:06,545
and equally liable under the law.

1224
01:39:06,713 --> 01:39:09,387
Well, then let me go! They can't
blame you because you didn't know!

1225
01:39:09,554 --> 01:39:12,465
After you found out, I ran away.
Just let me go!

1226
01:39:12,633 --> 01:39:14,703
If I let you run out now,
nothing could keep the lid on it.

1227
01:39:14,873 --> 01:39:18,070
They've got your real name. They'll
work up a complete dossier on you.

1228
01:39:18,233 --> 01:39:19,632
When they finally catch you,
and they will catch you,

1229
01:39:19,793 --> 01:39:21,464
they'll throw the
New York City Library at you.

1230
01:39:22,272 --> 01:39:24,867
But, suppose we don't lose our heads?

1231
01:39:25,033 --> 01:39:28,548
All we've got to fight is Strutt's
big mouth. That gives us time.

1232
01:39:29,393 --> 01:39:32,590
Sit down. Listen.
We can do one of two things.

1233
01:39:32,753 --> 01:39:35,585
We can hire a lawyer
and a psychiatrist,

1234
01:39:35,752 --> 01:39:39,143
and make an immediate voluntary
confession and an offer of restitution.

1235
01:39:39,313 --> 01:39:40,507
That'll make the whole thing public.

1236
01:39:40,993 --> 01:39:44,462
But the chances are very good
that you' ll get a suspended sentence.

1237
01:39:44,632 --> 01:39:46,703
Now the alternative.

1238
01:39:46,873 --> 01:39:49,751
We can go together and make private
calls on all the places you've robbed.

1239
01:39:50,233 --> 01:39:54,271
You'll express deep sorrow
and repentance,

1240
01:39:54,432 --> 01:39:55,911
sincere and vocal contrition.

1241
01:39:56,192 --> 01:39:59,104
And while you sob, I show a check
for the amount stolen.

1242
01:40:00,673 --> 01:40:01,947
Press it into their hands

1243
01:40:02,112 --> 01:40:04,672
and ask as a special favour
to a distraught husband,

1244
01:40:04,832 --> 01:40:07,142
to withdraw the charge.
But if one of them says,

1245
01:40:07,313 --> 01:40:09,304
"Thanks, I'll take the money,
but I won't drop the charge, "

1246
01:40:09,473 --> 01:40:10,462
then we 've had it.

1247
01:40:11,073 --> 01:40:13,584
After that it's an open court case,
and very probable sentence.

1248
01:40:16,551 --> 01:40:19,429
On the other hand, with a bit of luck
we might pull it off.

1249
01:40:19,591 --> 01:40:21,503
Think it over.

1250
01:40:22,631 --> 01:40:24,940
It's late. You better get some sleep.
You gotta be up for the hunt.

1251
01:40:25,111 --> 01:40:27,466
You don't expect me
to ride in the hunt!

1252
01:40:27,631 --> 01:40:29,111
Certainly I expect you to ride.

1253
01:40:29,272 --> 01:40:31,831
For one thing, I want you out of
the house when Strutt comes here.

1254
01:40:32,271 --> 01:40:33,908
For another, I don't want
to give Lil the satisfaction

1255
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:35,503
of seeing you chicken.

1256
01:40:36,191 --> 01:40:39,945
And, Marnie,
tonight the door stays open.

1257
01:40:46,831 --> 01:40:48,389
(Dogs Barking)

1258
01:41:27,830 --> 01:41:29,980
(Indistinct Chatter, Laughter)

1259
01:43:03,027 --> 01:43:05,541
(Screams)

1260
01:43:06,827 --> 01:43:09,135
(Whinnies)

1261
01:43:10,027 --> 01:43:11,779
(Screams)

1262
01:43:30,306 --> 01:43:32,377
Forio!

1263
01:43:36,826 --> 01:43:38,816
(Whinnies)

1264
01:43:53,866 --> 01:43:57,700
A gun! Give me a gun!
My horse is screaming!

1265
01:43:57,866 --> 01:44:01,142
- Get me a gun!
- You want to shoot your horse?

1266
01:44:01,306 --> 01:44:03,536
Hey, wait a minute!

1267
01:44:03,706 --> 01:44:07,984
I can't give you a gun, my mister
isn't home. I don't know what he'd -

1268
01:44:08,146 --> 01:44:10,579
You must be crazy!

1269
01:44:10,745 --> 01:44:13,213
Mrs Turpin!

1270
01:44:13,385 --> 01:44:16,025
Miss Mainwaring,
this woman comes tearing in here

1271
01:44:16,186 --> 01:44:17,539
demandin' I give her a gun.

1272
01:44:17,706 --> 01:44:20,936
Tell this fool to give me a gun.
Forio 's hurt!

1273
01:44:21,104 --> 01:44:24,700
Marnie, wait. I ' ll call a vet.
There's nothing a vet can do.

1274
01:44:24,865 --> 01:44:27,015
We don't have a phone
anyway, Miss Mainwaring.

1275
01:44:27,185 --> 01:44:30,415
If the horse is hurt bad,
I could give her Jack's pistol.

1276
01:44:30,584 --> 01:44:32,779
Hurry. Oh, hurry, please.
He's suffering.

1277
01:44:32,944 --> 01:44:34,775
Go get the gun!

1278
01:44:34,944 --> 01:44:37,139
I'll do it, Marnie. You wait here.

1279
01:44:37,304 --> 01:44:39,694
Are you still in the mood for killing?

1280
01:44:41,704 --> 01:44:43,456
Please, Marnie!

1281
01:44:43,624 --> 01:44:46,378
Stay out of my way!

1282
01:44:49,704 --> 01:44:51,659
Marnie, please!

1283
01:44:51,823 --> 01:44:53,098
If you don't want me to do it,

1284
01:44:53,264 --> 01:44:55,778
then let me go back
for one of the men.

1285
01:44:55,944 --> 01:44:58,014
(Whinnies)

1286
01:45:12,863 --> 01:45:15,583
There.

1287
01:45:15,744 --> 01:45:17,894
There now.

1288
01:45:23,064 --> 01:45:27,773
So you can see, Mr Strutt,
how very disadvantageous,

1289
01:45:27,943 --> 01:45:30,777
any action on your part
would be for everyone.

1290
01:45:31,423 --> 01:45:34,017
For me, certainly.

1291
01:45:34,183 --> 01:45:36,857
For a sick girl... and for you.

1292
01:45:37,744 --> 01:45:40,622
Yes, I 'm sure that's the fashionable
attitude, Mr Rutland.

1293
01:45:40,784 --> 01:45:43,855
But just wait until
you've been victimised.

1294
01:45:50,582 --> 01:45:54,700
(Mark) Try to look at the situation
from a business point of view.

1295
01:45:54,862 --> 01:45:56,818
(Strutt) Yes.

1296
01:45:56,982 --> 01:46:01,851
(Mark) We 've been business friends
for a number of years now.

1297
01:46:02,022 --> 01:46:04,091
(Continues Indistinct)

1298
01:47:02,861 --> 01:47:06,490
(Mark) I want you to apply
them all for my benefit.

1299
01:47:06,661 --> 01:47:08,571
(Strutt) Hm.

1300
01:47:11,260 --> 01:47:15,298
- (Phone Ringing)
- Oh, sorry.

1301
01:47:15,459 --> 01:47:17,336
Hello.

1302
01:47:17,499 --> 01:47:19,650
Yes, Lil, what is it?

1303
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:25,893
Yes, I understand.
I 'm hanging up now.

1304
01:47:26,059 --> 01:47:29,655
You' ll have to forgive me, I 've had
a bit of trouble at the hunt.

1305
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:33,699
I'll talk to you again, possibly
tomorrow. I'm sorry to run out.

1306
01:49:00,897 --> 01:49:03,252
(Mark)
I'll take you home, Marnie.

1307
01:49:08,656 --> 01:49:10,727
It's alright, darling.

1308
01:49:16,378 --> 01:49:18,652
You're just exhausted.
Now, don't panic.

1309
01:49:22,576 --> 01:49:25,569
I've spoken to Strutt. I think
I'll be able to talk him around.

1310
01:49:33,977 --> 01:49:37,287
I'll just put this away.

1311
01:50:02,415 --> 01:50:04,883
Go on. You want the money.

1312
01:50:05,055 --> 01:50:07,570
You wanted the money, or you wouldn't
have taken my keys, would you?

1313
01:50:07,736 --> 01:50:09,726
You took the keys,
now take the money!

1314
01:50:09,895 --> 01:50:11,886
I said take it!

1315
01:50:16,256 --> 01:50:19,405
What's mine belongs to you.
It's yours!

1316
01:50:19,574 --> 01:50:21,405
You're not stealing.

1317
01:50:21,574 --> 01:50:24,169
You want the money, take it.
I said take it!

1318
01:50:42,494 --> 01:50:47,250
Marnie, now we're going to
Baltimore to see your mother.

1319
01:50:47,415 --> 01:50:49,883
- No!
- Yes.

1320
01:51:03,454 --> 01:51:05,684
Come on.

1321
01:51:10,934 --> 01:51:14,324
So, I knew you'd run away,
and you'd want money.

1322
01:51:14,494 --> 01:51:17,769
It didn't take me a minute to find out
the office drawer key was gone.

1323
01:51:19,293 --> 01:51:23,445
If you tell my mother about me,
I'll kill you.

1324
01:51:24,653 --> 01:51:26,644
If you mean about the robberies,

1325
01:51:26,813 --> 01:51:29,533
I've no intention
of telling her anything.

1326
01:51:29,694 --> 01:51:32,729
It's your mother who's
going to do the talking.

1327
01:51:34,772 --> 01:51:37,003
(Thunderclaps)

1328
01:51:41,532 --> 01:51:44,001
Marnie, come on.

1329
01:51:44,173 --> 01:51:46,084
- No!
- Come on.

1330
01:52:03,132 --> 01:52:06,408
- It's alright, Marnie. You're inside.
- (Mama) What in the wide world -

1331
01:52:06,572 --> 01:52:08,927
I'm sorry to crash in
on you like this, Mrs Edgar.

1332
01:52:09,092 --> 01:52:12,482
I guess you know
how Marnie feels about storms.

1333
01:52:12,652 --> 01:52:15,883
Marnie, stop acting like
such a ninny.

1334
01:52:16,052 --> 01:52:18,771
Who are you, mister?
You're not Mr Pendleton.

1335
01:52:18,932 --> 01:52:20,810
No, I 'm not.
Who 's Mr Pendleton?

1336
01:52:20,973 --> 01:52:23,406
Then what have you got to do
with my Marnie?

1337
01:52:23,572 --> 01:52:26,085
I'm Mark Rutland,
Marnie's husband, Mrs Edgar.

1338
01:52:26,251 --> 01:52:28,004
Marnie hasn't been very well.

1339
01:52:28,172 --> 01:52:30,640
I don't believe she 's been well
since your accident.

1340
01:52:30,812 --> 01:52:31,801
My what?

1341
01:52:31,972 --> 01:52:33,768
I think you've always
called it "your accident."

1342
01:52:33,932 --> 01:52:36,924
What do you think
you' re talking about?

1343
01:52:37,092 --> 01:52:40,323
Comin' into my house like this,
talking about my accident!

1344
01:52:41,612 --> 01:52:44,283
You're not married to Marnie.
I don't believe you.

1345
01:52:44,450 --> 01:52:47,601
- Marnie?
- Your daughter needs help, Mrs Edgar.

1346
01:52:47,770 --> 01:52:49,363
You've got to tell her the truth.

1347
01:52:49,531 --> 01:52:51,601
She has no memory
of what happened that night.

1348
01:52:51,771 --> 01:52:55,844
And she needs to remember everything!
You must help her.

1349
01:52:56,011 --> 01:52:58,525
Mister, you must be plumb crazy.

1350
01:52:58,691 --> 01:53:02,080
If you won't tell her, I will.
I know everything that happened.

1351
01:53:02,250 --> 01:53:04,969
- I'll tell her the whole story.
- Oh, no you won't,

1352
01:53:05,130 --> 01:53:08,759
because you don't know the whole story,
and nobody does but me!

1353
01:53:09,410 --> 01:53:13,199
Oh. Well, since you're so very
knowledgeable, Mrs Edgar,

1354
01:53:13,371 --> 01:53:14,519
do you also know that your daughter,

1355
01:53:14,690 --> 01:53:16,806
your beautiful, young daughter,

1356
01:53:16,970 --> 01:53:18,962
cannot stand to have a man
touch her? Any man?

1357
01:53:19,011 --> 01:53:21,080
She doesn't know why, but you do.

1358
01:53:21,370 --> 01:53:24,998
Don't you think you owe it to her to
help her to understand what happened

1359
01:53:25,170 --> 01:53:27,081
- to make her like this?
- What matters what made her?

1360
01:53:27,250 --> 01:53:30,720
She's lucky to feel like that!
Just plain lucky!

1361
01:53:32,050 --> 01:53:34,440
That's very interesting, Mrs Edgar.

1362
01:53:34,611 --> 01:53:36,601
But I've had
an investigator working here.

1363
01:53:36,690 --> 01:53:38,919
I 've read the transcript. Hm?

1364
01:53:39,089 --> 01:53:41,240
The records of your trial for murder.

1365
01:53:41,410 --> 01:53:43,287
In the records
it states quite plainly

1366
01:53:43,450 --> 01:53:45,565
that you made your
living from the touch of men.

1367
01:53:45,729 --> 01:53:50,599
It was one of your clients that
you killed that night.

1368
01:53:50,770 --> 01:53:53,489
Oh, God!

1369
01:53:53,650 --> 01:53:55,641
Was there also a storm
that night, Mrs Edgar?

1370
01:53:55,810 --> 01:53:57,765
Is that why Marnie's
terrified of storms?

1371
01:53:57,929 --> 01:54:00,204
Was there thunder
and lightning that night?

1372
01:54:00,369 --> 01:54:02,440
Did the storms terrify
your little girl,

1373
01:54:02,610 --> 01:54:04,122
in addition to everything
else that happened?

1374
01:54:04,289 --> 01:54:07,405
Get out of my house.

1375
01:54:07,568 --> 01:54:10,003
You get out!

1376
01:54:10,169 --> 01:54:12,888
I don't need any filthy man
comin' in my house no more!

1377
01:54:13,049 --> 01:54:14,686
Do you hear me? You get out!

1378
01:54:16,047 --> 01:54:18,960
You get out of my house! (Screaming)

1379
01:54:19,128 --> 01:54:21,198
You get out!

1380
01:54:22,528 --> 01:54:24,326
You let my mama go!

1381
01:54:24,489 --> 01:54:28,242
You hear? You let my mama go!

1382
01:54:28,408 --> 01:54:32,084
- You're hurtin' my mama!
- Who am I, Marnie?

1383
01:54:32,249 --> 01:54:36,957
- Why should I want to hurt your mama?
- You' re one of them.

1384
01:54:38,488 --> 01:54:41,605
- One of them in the white suits.
- Shut up, Marnie!

1385
01:54:41,768 --> 01:54:46,559
No! Remember, Marnie.
Tell us how it all was.

1386
01:54:47,528 --> 01:54:50,088
The white suits! Remember?

1387
01:54:53,048 --> 01:54:55,926
(Tapping)

1388
01:54:56,088 --> 01:54:58,362
What does the tapping mean, Marnie?

1389
01:54:58,527 --> 01:55:00,564
Why does it make you cry?

1390
01:55:00,728 --> 01:55:04,846
It means... they want in.

1391
01:55:05,008 --> 01:55:08,398
Them in their white suits.

1392
01:55:08,568 --> 01:55:12,560
Mama comes and gets me out of bed.

1393
01:55:12,727 --> 01:55:15,162
I don't like to get out of bed.

1394
01:55:32,806 --> 01:55:36,196
Come on, Marnie.

1395
01:55:36,366 --> 01:55:39,324
Get up. Alright?

1396
01:55:39,486 --> 01:55:42,444
Good girl.

1397
01:55:42,606 --> 01:55:45,519
That's my baby.

1398
01:55:45,687 --> 01:55:48,075
There.

1399
01:55:50,805 --> 01:55:53,240
There. Mm.

1400
01:55:53,406 --> 01:55:57,001
- You go on back to sleep, sugarpop.
- Bernice.

1401
01:56:02,726 --> 01:56:05,922
- (Thunderclap)
- (Sobbing)

1402
01:56:11,325 --> 01:56:15,797
Now, you ain't afraid of a little bit
of lightning, are you? Huh?

1403
01:56:18,446 --> 01:56:20,640
What happens next, Marnie?

1404
01:56:20,926 --> 01:56:25,953
He - He come out... to me.

1405
01:56:28,446 --> 01:56:32,199
Oh, I don't like him.
He - He smells funny.

1406
01:56:32,365 --> 01:56:35,243
Your old captain's gonna be here
all through the night.

1407
01:56:35,405 --> 01:56:36,725
There's no reason to cry.

1408
01:56:36,886 --> 01:56:38,604
I want my mama!

1409
01:56:38,766 --> 01:56:43,919
I don't want you! Let me go! Mama!

1410
01:56:44,085 --> 01:56:46,201
(Sobbing)

1411
01:56:46,365 --> 01:56:49,641
Get your damn hands off my kid!

1412
01:56:49,805 --> 01:56:52,716
What are you trying to -
What are you -

1413
01:56:57,044 --> 01:56:58,763
Mama?

1414
01:56:58,925 --> 01:57:02,313
Make him go, Mama.

1415
01:57:02,483 --> 01:57:05,874
I don't like him to kiss me.
Make him go, Mama!

1416
01:57:06,044 --> 01:57:08,239
(Marnie Screams)

1417
01:57:08,404 --> 01:57:11,315
Get your hands - Get your hands -

1418
01:57:11,483 --> 01:57:14,476
There's nothing the matter
with my hands!

1419
01:57:16,244 --> 01:57:18,677
(Mark) What is it, Marnie?
What's the matter?

1420
01:57:18,843 --> 01:57:20,402
He hit my mama!

1421
01:57:20,564 --> 01:57:23,953
No! No! What's the matter with you?
You crazy or drunk?

1422
01:57:24,123 --> 01:57:27,753
Now, don't go hittin' me.
You're gonna get hit yourself.

1423
01:57:31,164 --> 01:57:36,078
- (Screams)
- Oh, my leg!

1424
01:57:36,243 --> 01:57:38,120
- Mama?
- Is your mother hurt?

1425
01:57:38,283 --> 01:57:42,959
- How? How is she hurt?
- He fell on her.

1426
01:57:43,123 --> 01:57:45,921
Oh, she's so hurt! Oh, Mama.

1427
01:57:46,083 --> 01:57:49,201
Marnie! Marnie, help me!

1428
01:57:52,883 --> 01:57:54,395
I got to help my mama!

1429
01:57:54,562 --> 01:57:56,519
(Sobbing)

1430
01:58:00,243 --> 01:58:02,233
Marnie?

1431
01:58:03,763 --> 01:58:06,231
I hit him!

1432
01:58:06,403 --> 01:58:10,362
I hit him with a stick. I - I hurt him!

1433
01:58:18,042 --> 01:58:21,717
There. There now.

1434
01:58:23,361 --> 01:58:27,037
- (Screams, Sobs)
- (Screams)

1435
01:58:37,001 --> 01:58:40,233
You're alright now, darling.
You're alright.

1436
01:58:40,402 --> 01:58:43,121
It's all over.

1437
01:58:43,282 --> 01:58:45,158
You're alright.

1438
01:59:06,521 --> 01:59:10,036
I thought when she lost
her memory of that night,

1439
01:59:10,201 --> 01:59:12,476
it was a sign of God's forgiveness.

1440
01:59:12,641 --> 01:59:15,916
I thought I was being
given another chance

1441
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:18,959
to change everything,

1442
01:59:19,121 --> 01:59:21,237
to make it all up to her.

1443
01:59:21,921 --> 01:59:24,311
I 'm sorry, Mrs Edgar.

1444
01:59:24,481 --> 01:59:27,119
Truly sorry.

1445
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:30,955
Your mother told the police that she'd
killed the sailor in self-defense.

1446
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:34,999
They could see how bad hurt I was.
They believed me.

1447
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:39,278
And I never told anyone the truth.

1448
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:41,237
Never.

1449
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:43,914
Not even when they tried to take you
away from me, Marnie.

1450
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:46,912
Not even then.

1451
01:59:48,199 --> 01:59:52,750
You must've loved me, Mama.
You must've loved me!

1452
01:59:55,559 --> 01:59:59,234
You're the only thing in
this world I ever did love.

1453
02:00:04,479 --> 02:00:09,109
It - it was just that
I was so young, Marnie.

1454
02:00:10,759 --> 02:00:13,398
I never had anything of my own.

1455
02:00:19,119 --> 02:00:21,234
You know how I got you, Marnie?

1456
02:00:26,398 --> 02:00:28,832
There was this boy.

1457
02:00:28,998 --> 02:00:31,308
Billy.

1458
02:00:31,479 --> 02:00:35,757
And I wanted Billy's
basketball sweater.

1459
02:00:36,838 --> 02:00:39,591
I was 15.

1460
02:00:40,878 --> 02:00:43,711
And Billy said, if I let him,

1461
02:00:43,878 --> 02:00:46,439
I could have the sweater.

1462
02:00:47,678 --> 02:00:49,669
So I let him.

1463
02:00:53,239 --> 02:00:57,197
And then, later on when you got
started, he run away.

1464
02:01:00,477 --> 02:01:03,514
I still got that old sweater.

1465
02:01:05,397 --> 02:01:07,150
And I got you, Marnie.

1466
02:01:10,237 --> 02:01:14,754
And after the accident,
when I was in the hospital,

1467
02:01:14,918 --> 02:01:17,669
they tried to make me
let you be adopted.

1468
02:01:17,836 --> 02:01:20,111
But I wouldn't.

1469
02:01:20,276 --> 02:01:22,074
I wanted you.

1470
02:01:22,237 --> 02:01:24,546
And I promised God right then,

1471
02:01:24,717 --> 02:01:29,108
if he'd let me keep you,
and you not remember,

1472
02:01:29,277 --> 02:01:32,713
I'd bring you up different from me.

1473
02:01:32,877 --> 02:01:34,912
Decent.

1474
02:01:35,076 --> 02:01:37,830
Decent?

1475
02:01:37,997 --> 02:01:40,556
Oh, Mama!

1476
02:01:42,316 --> 02:01:44,706
Well, you surely realised
your ambition.

1477
02:01:44,877 --> 02:01:48,153
I certainly am decent.

1478
02:01:49,436 --> 02:01:51,667
Of course I'm a cheat,

1479
02:01:51,837 --> 02:01:54,828
and a liar and a thief,

1480
02:01:55,876 --> 02:01:57,833
but I am decent.

1481
02:01:59,676 --> 02:02:04,511
Marnie, it's time to have a
little compassion for yourself.

1482
02:02:04,676 --> 02:02:07,066
When a child,

1483
02:02:07,237 --> 02:02:11,194
a child of any age, Marnie,
can't get love,

1484
02:02:11,355 --> 02:02:14,712
it takes what it can get,
any way it can get it.

1485
02:02:14,876 --> 02:02:17,834
It's not so hard to understand.

1486
02:02:30,954 --> 02:02:34,470
Get up, Marnie, you' re aching my leg.

1487
02:02:50,754 --> 02:02:54,144
There. That's better.

1488
02:02:55,914 --> 02:02:58,065
Mark?

1489
02:03:00,075 --> 02:03:02,144
Wha - What am I going to do?

1490
02:03:02,314 --> 02:03:05,432
What's going to happen?

1491
02:03:05,594 --> 02:03:08,108
What do you want to happen?

1492
02:03:09,354 --> 02:03:13,506
I guess I... I want it all cleared up.

1493
02:03:13,674 --> 02:03:15,266
Will I -

1494
02:03:16,514 --> 02:03:19,313
Will I go to jail?

1495
02:03:19,955 --> 02:03:23,549
No. Not after what
I have to tell them.

1496
02:03:29,834 --> 02:03:31,744
We'll go now.

1497
02:03:38,834 --> 02:03:41,667
Ah, Mrs Edgar, I'll bring Marnie back.

1498
02:03:41,834 --> 02:03:44,631
She's very tired now.

1499
02:03:45,833 --> 02:03:47,824
Goodbye, Mama.

1500
02:03:49,673 --> 02:03:51,664
Goodbye.

1501
02:03:57,313 --> 02:03:59,304
Goodbye, sugarpop.

1502
02:04:12,752 --> 02:04:15,107
Oh, Mark,

1503
02:04:15,272 --> 02:04:17,503
I don't want to go to jail.

1504
02:04:17,673 --> 02:04:19,424
I'd rather stay with you.

1505
02:04:19,592 --> 02:04:22,026
Had you, love?

1506
02:04:22,192 --> 02:04:24,911
(Girls) # Send for the doctor
over the hill.

1507
02:04:25,072 --> 02:04:27,745
# Call for the doctor.
Call for the nurse.

1508
02:04:27,912 --> 02:04:30,824
# Call for the lady
with the alligator purse.
