1
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,860
黑暗的中世纪...

2
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:39,160
恶毒的女王听说一个即将诞生的女婴会在
将来推翻她的统治成为王位的合法继承人

3
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:49,170
遂下令将王国内孕妇全部抓住
所有的女婴全部处死...

4
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,723
- 是个女孩？
- 嗯


5
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,807
- 让我看看她的胳膊
- 她身上有那个标记


6
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,098
不可能!


7
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,858
预言是真的
我必须通知妈妈


8
00:01:16,158 --> 00:01:18,446
- 求你帮帮我!
- 我不能


9
00:01:18,577 --> 00:01:20,984
他们会杀死她的


10
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:27,864
求你!求求你了!


11
00:01:30,463 --> 00:01:33,961
哦, 艾斯纳谢谢你
谢谢

12
00:01:41,931 --> 00:01:44,504
站在一边让开，巴夫莫达女王来啦!


13
00:02:09,082 --> 00:02:11,288
你无法阻止预言!


14
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:14,500
这个孩子的能力不能超过我
仪式开始


15
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:16,917
不. 不要!


16
00:02:17,048 --> 00:02:19,336
孩子呢?


17
00:02:19,467 --> 00:02:21,922
- 一定是接生婆
- 索尔沙去找到那个孩子


18
00:02:22,053 --> 00:02:25,386
把狗带上
把她活着带回来!


19
00:02:25,514 --> 00:02:27,589
你残暴恐怖的统治该结束了!


20
00:02:27,725 --> 00:02:29,764
她会回来杀了你!

21
00:02:29,894 --> 00:02:33,392
- 我的孩子会杀了你!
- 杀了她


22
00:06:00,758 --> 00:06:02,714
爸爸!爸爸!


23
00:06:06,138 --> 00:06:08,213
- 爸爸!爸爸!
- 吁!吁!


24
00:06:10,726 --> 00:06:13,892
爸爸!爸爸!
河里发现了些东西

25
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,893
拉农现在我走不开，也不能和你玩儿

26
00:06:16,022 --> 00:06:18,180
- 我现在要干活
- 你必须来. 快点!


27
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:25,731
走吧


28
00:06:28,617 --> 00:06:31,190
别接近她
我们不知道她从哪来的

29
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:34,163
但是, 爸爸, 她只是个孩子


30
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:39,034
- 她不太像我们
- 不. 她不是奈尔人

31
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:42,667
- 她看起来像个戴基尼
- 戴基尼是什么?


32
00:06:42,797 --> 00:06:46,545
戴基尼都很大
是住在远方的巨人


33
00:06:48,428 --> 00:06:50,669
她很可爱


34
00:06:50,805 --> 00:06:53,722
- 爸爸, 我们能收留她吗?
- 不行!


35
00:06:55,309 --> 00:07:00,053
我们把她送到下游就当从未见过她. 快点


36
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:02,062
阿福古德! 威洛・阿福古德!


37
00:07:03,317 --> 00:07:06,317
这样吧
你们只需要做两件事


38
00:07:06,445 --> 00:07:09,778
别让她出声
别碰她


39
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:15,944
布尔格莱库特先生, 我丈夫没偷东西!


40
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,120
阿福古德你还没把钱还给我


41
00:07:24,253 --> 00:07:26,292
这些种子哪来的？


42
00:07:26,422 --> 00:07:29,090
嘿嘿, 我用的魔法


43
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:33,135
阿福古德你不是巫师
你只是个变戏法的


44
00:07:33,262 --> 00:07:36,760
这的人都从我这里买种子
告诉我你从哪弄来的


45
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,305
去年秋天我家人在树林里找到的


46
00:07:40,435 --> 00:07:43,388
布尔格莱库特先生, 我们没有违法

47
00:07:43,522 --> 00:07:46,937
威洛孩子们不是自己在小溪旁吧?


48
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:49,646
魔法?


49
00:07:49,777 --> 00:07:53,394
你用魔法在下雨前种好你的东西吧


50
00:07:55,574 --> 00:07:57,447
阿福古德这片土地是我的了...


51
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:01,075
而且你将不会在我的土地上干活了


52
00:08:11,505 --> 00:08:13,129
你太可爱了


53
00:08:13,258 --> 00:08:15,214
是啊，你很可爱


54
00:08:15,343 --> 00:08:16,837
嘉叶!


55
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:19,718
哦，威洛!


56
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:20,961
好孩子


57
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:24,715
没错
任何时候...


58
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:27,519
家里的每一个人都很爱她

59
00:08:27,646 --> 00:08:32,307
你说得对. 来吧, 米姆斯. 我们走


60
00:08:32,442 --> 00:08:34,434
我们走吧. 快


61
00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:37,320
嘿, 你当我是透明的啊!


62
00:08:37,697 --> 00:08:39,985
米姆斯? 拉农?


63
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:55,034
我们帮你洗干净


64
00:09:01,428 --> 00:09:04,049
威洛你说我们应该把她带到镇议会上去吗？


65
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,670
不. 不行
他们会认为她是个不祥之物


66
00:09:06,808 --> 00:09:09,594
认为她会带来洪灾或干旱,
然后大家一起指责我


67
00:09:09,728 --> 00:09:12,562
"威洛带来了那个戴基尼人, 不是吗?"


68
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:15,642
"没错. 而且他是个下贱的农夫. 把他抓起来!"


69
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,683
威洛, 冷静


70
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:19,810
让我冷静?


71
00:09:19,945 --> 00:09:21,937
嘉叶, 明天对我来说很重要


72
00:09:22,072 --> 00:09:25,736
亲爱的, 伟大的阿尔德温先生很多年没收徒弟了


73
00:09:25,868 --> 00:09:29,034
明天不一样
我知道他会选我


74
00:09:31,915 --> 00:09:35,497
- 来, 抱着她
- 嘿, 嘉叶, 我不想抱她


75
00:09:35,626 --> 00:09:38,377
你抱着她我去拿奶

76
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:48,543
爸爸, 她喜欢你


77
00:09:58,106 --> 00:09:59,730
再见


78
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:03,398
孩子们我们走吧


79
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:14,409
现在我用魔力把这些环连起来!


80
00:10:43,482 --> 00:10:44,892
谢谢, 好儿子


81
00:10:46,276 --> 00:10:50,024
如果你胆子很小, 你最好赶快离开


82
00:11:06,462 --> 00:11:08,620
我要那个熟透了的. 好极了


83
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,132
现在,
在我最后的魔术表演中...

84
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:23,594
我将让这只猪消失!


85
00:11:34,155 --> 00:11:37,523
请大家仔细看


86
00:11:37,658 --> 00:11:41,441
(咒语)


87
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,116
你的猪呢?


88
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:53,582
晕!
嘿, 你这死猪, 过来!


89
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:00,174
我看够了


90
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,028
注意!


91
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,865
阿尔德温先生要收新徒弟了!


92
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,407
想拜师的就上来吧


93
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,861
- 祝你好运
- 爸爸, 祝你好运


94
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:32,697
威洛・阿福古德, 他想拜师?
他怎么可能被选中?


95
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,290
不可笑吗?


96
00:12:43,302 --> 00:12:47,714
魔法是宇宙中的血液!


97
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:52,346
忘记你们做学过的和你们现在所想的


98
00:12:52,478 --> 00:12:56,427
你们只需要用你们的直觉


99
00:12:56,565 --> 00:13:00,644
能控制世界的能量...

100
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:04,027
在哪个手指?


101
00:13:48,114 --> 00:13:50,604
今年还是没有新徒弟!


102
00:14:12,178 --> 00:14:15,511
- 米姆斯在哪?
- 我不知道. 她刚刚在这!
- Where's Mims?
- I don't know. She was right here!

103
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,474
快带拉农去那边!
Take Ranon in there, quick!

104
00:14:26,442 --> 00:14:28,066
米姆斯!
Mims!

105
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,996
爸爸我害怕!
I'm scared, Dada!

106
00:15:00,598 --> 00:15:03,135
快跑!
Come on!

107
00:15:20,867 --> 00:15:22,693
沃卡尔接着!
Vohnkar!

108
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:36,207
- 检查一下
- 他死了!
- Check to make sure.
- It's dead!

109
00:15:38,593 --> 00:15:40,336
爸爸! 爸爸!
Dada! Dada!

110
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:45,928
他好像是在找谁的孩子!
It was looking
for somebody's baby!

111
00:15:49,686 --> 00:15:52,686
- 妈妈
- 嘉叶!
- Mommy.
- Kiaya!

112
00:16:04,742 --> 00:16:06,568
我在
I'm here.

113
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:16,540
嘉叶我们不能留着这孩子了
We can't keep the baby, Kiaya.

114
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,421
我们应该把她送去议会
We have to take her
to the village council.

115
00:16:32,935 --> 00:16:34,559
安静!
Silence!

116
00:16:34,686 --> 00:16:37,888
我们能杀死一只野兽,
但是他们会来的更多
One beast we can kill,
but there may be more.

117
00:16:38,024 --> 00:16:40,230
而且他们不会停止...
And you can be assured
that they won't give up...

118
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:42,398
直到找到他们想找的孩子!
until they find
what they're looking for!

119
00:16:42,527 --> 00:16:45,729
- 这只是个警告!
- 谁该对这件事负责?
- It's a sign!
- Who's to blame for this?

120
00:16:45,864 --> 00:16:48,271
我们应该找出那个罪人, 然后把他扔进地洞活埋!
We must find the culprit
and throw him in the pit!

121
00:16:50,619 --> 00:16:53,192
活埋他! 活埋!
In the pit! In the pit!

122
00:16:58,334 --> 00:17:00,373
威洛.
Willow.

123
00:17:00,502 --> 00:17:01,996
威洛・阿福古德.
Willow Ufgood.

124
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,048
过来
Come forward.

125
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:16,925
阿尔德温先生, 我的孩子在河边找到的这个婴儿.
My children found this baby
alone by the river, High Aldwin.

126
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,765
是个戴基尼人
A Daikini child.

127
00:17:24,942 --> 00:17:27,859
那就是那些野兽想要的,
还给他们吧!
That's what the beasts want.
Let's give it back to them!

128
00:17:29,405 --> 00:17:32,607
- 他们会杀了她的! 你们不能送她回去!
- 她不属于我们
- They'll kill her! You can't!
- It isn't one of us.

129
00:17:32,742 --> 00:17:35,363
这个小孩很特别!
This child is special!

130
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:39,737
这个孩子必须被送到村子的界碑
This child must be taken
beyond the boundaries of our village.

131
00:17:39,873 --> 00:17:42,873
穿过小溪...
All the way across
the great river...

132
00:17:43,001 --> 00:17:45,040
直到戴基尼的聚会中心
to the Daikini crossroads.

133
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:47,576
好吧, 谁送去?
Well, who'll do that?

134
00:17:48,131 --> 00:17:50,502
看起来...
It seems only fair...

135
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:53,088
有一个人最合适...
that the man to take
this baby to the crossroads...

136
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:56,219
就是那个把孩子从河里拿回来的人
be the very man
who plucked it out of the river.

137
00:17:57,931 --> 00:18:00,468
我提议威洛・阿福古德.
I nominate Willow Ufgood.

138
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,762
不行!
No!

139
00:18:03,229 --> 00:18:05,636
用骨头来决定吧!
I will consult the bones!

140
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,655
从这上面什么也看不出
The bones tell me nothing.

141
00:18:22,872 --> 00:18:25,113
你喜欢这个孩子吗?
Do you have any love
for this child?

142
00:18:33,966 --> 00:18:35,376
是的
Yes.

143
00:18:36,676 --> 00:18:38,086
好的, 我去
Yes, I do.

144
00:18:38,219 --> 00:18:41,219
骨头说了!
The bones have spoken!

145
00:18:42,682 --> 00:18:46,595
威洛・阿福古德, 村子的安危就看你的了
Willow Ufgood, the safety
of this village depends upon you.

146
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:50,772
- 伟大的骨头!
- 伟大的骨头!
- Praise the bones!
- Praise the bones!

147
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:53,353
但是你需要帮助
But you will need help.

148
00:18:53,484 --> 00:18:58,690
谁有勇气在这一路上保护我们的勇士?
Who has the courage to protect
our brave fellow on his journey?

149
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:04,905
- 我和他去
- 啊, 米戈什
- I'll go with him.
- Ah, Meegosh.

150
00:19:05,036 --> 00:19:06,446
好极了
Excellent choice.

151
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:10,829
- 我也去!
- 沃卡尔! 沃卡尔!
- I'll go!
- Vohnkar! Vohnkar!

152
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,579
不! 沃卡尔不行!
他是村子里最好的战士!
No! Not Vohnkar!
He's the best warrior in the village!

153
00:19:13,712 --> 00:19:16,795
我们需要他保护村子!
沃卡尔, 退下!
We need him here!
Vohnkar, step back!

154
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:27,471
这个小队需要一个头
All this expedition needs
is a leader.

155
00:19:28,851 --> 00:19:32,895
根据骨头来看,
这个领袖是...
And according to the bones,
that leader is...

156
00:19:34,022 --> 00:19:35,848
你, 布尔格莱库特先生!
you, Burglekutt!

157
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:39,524
沃卡尔!
Vohnkar!

158
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:44,655
- 你怎么孩子?
- 什么意思?
- What's your problem, son?
- How do you mean?

159
00:19:45,408 --> 00:19:50,033
当我让你看我的手指的时候,
你一开始想选哪个?
When I held up my fingers,
what was your first impulse?

160
00:19:50,162 --> 00:19:53,197
- 不了, 想法很愚蠢
- 没事, 说吧
- Well, it was stupid.
-Just tell me.

161
00:19:54,124 --> 00:19:56,697
- 我想选我自己的手指
- 啊哈!
- To pick my own finger.
- Aha!

162
00:19:56,835 --> 00:20:00,417
那就是正确答案
你对自己的信心不足啊
That was the correct answer.
You lack faith in yourself.

163
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:03,333
你比村子里的其他人...
More than anyone in the village...

164
00:20:03,466 --> 00:20:06,039
更具成为巫师的潜能
you have the potential
to be a great sorcerer.

165
00:20:06,177 --> 00:20:10,885
听着, 一路上一定要相信自己
Now, when you're out there,
listen to your own heart.

166
00:20:12,684 --> 00:20:15,055
这些东西会保护你
These will protect you.

167
00:20:15,186 --> 00:20:17,937
- 橡果?
- 他们具有魔力!
- Acorns?
- They're magic!

168
00:20:18,063 --> 00:20:21,929
我只记得我比你厉害, 然后你无力反抗
被投中的东西将变成石头
Anything you throw them at
turns to stone.

169
00:20:25,112 --> 00:20:28,314
你还有很多东西要学,
年轻的阿福古德.
You have much to learn,
young Ufgood.

170
00:20:41,294 --> 00:20:43,001
爸爸你还怕吗?
Are you scared, Dada?

171
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:45,709
不怕
No.

172
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,878
树林里的仙女...
Even with fairies in the woods...

173
00:20:48,008 --> 00:20:49,964
她会让你睡上百年你也不怕?
that'll put you to sleep
for a hundred years?

174
00:20:51,594 --> 00:20:54,131
- 对我不起作用
- 棕色人?
- Doesn't bother me.
- Brownies?

175
00:20:54,264 --> 00:20:57,134
- 巨龙?
- 洞穴巨人呢?
- Dragons?
- Trolls?

176
00:20:57,267 --> 00:21:00,635
洞穴巨人会把你活剥, 然后把你的脸割下来?
Trolls that'll skin you alive
and take your face off?

177
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:04,346
拉农!
你知道我讨厌洞穴巨人
Ranon!
You know I hate trolls.

178
00:21:04,482 --> 00:21:06,937
我可以当你们的卫兵帮你们拿武器
I can be your guard
and carry your spear.

179
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:09,273
爸爸我也行我也行
Me too. Me too, Dada.

180
00:21:10,863 --> 00:21:13,187
我是个多么幸福的父亲啊
What a lucky father I am.

181
00:21:13,324 --> 00:21:16,075
我也想带着你们去
I wish I could take
you bobbins with me.

182
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:21,409
爸爸再见
Goodbye, Dada.

183
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:26,164
继续玩儿去吧
Go play! Go on.

184
00:21:31,674 --> 00:21:34,544
我们还没有分开
We've never been apart.

185
00:21:37,388 --> 00:21:39,629
我已经开始想你了
I miss you already.

186
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:42,384
嘉叶别担心
Don't worry, Kiaya.

187
00:21:42,518 --> 00:21:46,384
我会没事的, 我会很快回来的
I'll be fine, and I'll be back
before you know it.

188
00:21:48,773 --> 00:21:51,441
好的, 记住给她保暖
Well, remember to keep her warm.

189
00:21:53,528 --> 00:21:56,149
还有这个
And here.

190
00:21:58,407 --> 00:22:01,158
会给你带来好运的
This will bring you luck.

191
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,580
勇敢的孩子们!
Good brave people!

192
00:22:18,551 --> 00:22:21,219
外面的世界对奈尔人没有容身之处的
The outer world is
no place for a Nelwyn.

193
00:22:21,346 --> 00:22:23,967
把孩子交给戴基尼人...
Give the baby
to the first Daikini you see...

194
00:22:24,098 --> 00:22:26,220
然后马上回家
then hurry home.

195
00:22:29,603 --> 00:22:33,137
Tuatha lawkathok tuatha! (咒语)
Tuatha lawkathok tuatha!

196
00:22:34,024 --> 00:22:36,728
按照鸟所指引的方向前进吧!
Go in the direction
the bird is flying!

197
00:22:41,448 --> 00:22:43,606
哈哈那鸟飞回来了!
It's going back to the village!

198
00:22:45,285 --> 00:22:47,491
算了不用鸟了
沿着河走吧
Ignore the bird.
Follow the river.

199
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,659
启程!
Move out!

200
00:23:13,811 --> 00:23:16,681
- 米戈什等等
- 怎么了?
- Hold on, Meegosh.
- What's wrong?

201
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:19,562
我们必须停止
We have to stop.

202
00:23:19,692 --> 00:23:21,316
停下来? 为什么?
Stop? Why?

203
00:23:21,444 --> 00:23:23,768
孩子生病了
The baby's sick.

204
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,987
她没有!
让我看看
She's not sick!
Let me see.

205
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:37,037
抱着她! 把她拿开!
Take her! Take her!

206
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:41,376
她休息一会儿就会好了
She'll be fine
once she gets some rest.

207
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,381
帮我擦干净
Clean me up.

208
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,300
我没和你说要这个女佣死
I didn't ask you
to bring me a dead nursemaid.

209
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,929
- 索尔沙你真没用!
- 我这就去沿着女佣的脚印找
-Sorsha, you're useless!
-I'm backtracking the nursemaid's trail.

210
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,549
一定能找到她把孩子藏在哪里了
I'll find where she hid the baby.

211
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,770
啊, 凯尔将军来了
Ah, General Kael, at last.

212
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:07,558
女王, 我已经摧毁了格拉敦的城堡
My queen, I have destroyed
the castle at Galladoorn.

213
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:11,313
干得好. 我现在有另一个任务交给你
Well done. But now I have
another task for you.

214
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:16,869
帮我女儿找到那个小孩儿...
Help my daughter to find
that tiny, helpless baby...

215
00:24:16,996 --> 00:24:18,869
她还在逃往
that continues somehow
to elude her.

216
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:23,999
语言中的那个孩子?
那个将毁掉你的孩子?
The baby of the prophecy?
The one that would destroy you?

217
00:24:24,127 --> 00:24:26,333
我要她活着
I need that baby alive.

218
00:24:26,463 --> 00:24:28,834
我必须举行那个仪式...
I must perform
the ritual that will exile...

219
00:24:28,965 --> 00:24:32,298
然后这个孩子的灵魂将被放逐到遗忘之地
the child's spirit into oblivion.

220
00:24:32,427 --> 00:24:35,095
- 给我找到她!
- 妈, 我不需要他帮忙
- Find her!
- I don't need his help, Mother.

221
00:24:35,221 --> 00:24:37,177
找我说得做
You'll do as I say, child.

222
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,852
我看到了一个提示
I read the signs.

223
00:24:45,982 --> 00:24:49,101
恐怕有一天你女儿会被判你
One day, I fear,
your daughter will betray you.

224
00:24:49,235 --> 00:24:53,362
我相信她胜过相信你
I trust her loyalty
more than I trust yours.

225
00:25:09,587 --> 00:25:11,413
快跑!
Move!

226
00:25:12,172 --> 00:25:15,172
有伏兵.
快. 快走!
It's an ambush.
Come on. Move!

227
00:25:18,012 --> 00:25:19,636
快点!
Come on!

228
00:25:31,316 --> 00:25:33,189
孩子在奈尔人那里
The Nelwyns have got the baby.

229
00:25:33,318 --> 00:25:35,986
我们搜遍了整个村子,
但是他们中有一群人跑了
We've searched the village, but a group
of them are on the road somewhere.

230
00:25:36,112 --> 00:25:39,112
他们走不远!
They couldn't have gone far!

231
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:41,397
扩大搜索范围,
随时报告给索尔沙!
Widen the search
and report to Sorsha!

232
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:51,783
走
我们继续前进
Come.
We'll keep to the woods.

233
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,824
看那边!
That's it!

234
00:26:32,957 --> 00:26:34,996
一个十字路口!
It's the crossroads!

235
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:55,718
把火点旺点
不知道附近会出现什么
Keep this fire high.
We don't know what's out there.

236
00:27:01,734 --> 00:27:03,892
什么声音?
What was that?

237
00:27:05,028 --> 00:27:06,735
拿着矛!
Get the spears!

238
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:29,088
给我点水, 要不你就死
Give me some water, peck,
or you die.

239
00:27:29,218 --> 00:27:31,589
明白吗?
Do you understand?

240
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,546
水
Water.

241
00:27:36,225 --> 00:27:37,635
快拿来!
Hurry up!

242
00:27:41,772 --> 00:27:44,606
给我点水,
你们这些下贱的侏儒!
Get me some water,
you measly little pecks!

243
00:27:46,025 --> 00:27:48,147
他是戴基尼人. 我们很幸运
It's a Daikini. We're in luck.

244
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:52,313
- 我们不能把这个孩子给他!
- 把他吊在这肯定有原因的
- We can't give her to him!
- Somebody put him there for a reason.

245
00:27:52,449 --> 00:27:56,695
阿福古德, 我们必须把孩子扔掉
后面有追兵
Ufgood, we've got to get rid of her.
Those soldiers are after us.

246
00:27:57,495 --> 00:28:00,246
他盯着我们看呢
He's looking right at us.

247
00:28:04,209 --> 00:28:06,201
我们必须把孩子给人
We've got to give
that baby to somebody.

248
00:28:06,962 --> 00:28:09,120
我是最适合的人选
I'm somebody.

249
00:28:09,923 --> 00:28:12,958
放我出去, 我来照顾孩子
Let me out of here.
I'll take care of the baby.

250
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,758
我相信他
I trust him completely.

251
00:28:17,888 --> 00:28:21,636
- 但是他刚刚想掐死我!
- 我想回家
- But he tried to strangle me!
- I want to go home.

252
00:28:21,768 --> 00:28:25,350
不行, 布尔格莱库特!
我们应该再等等!
No, Burglekutt!
We should wait!

253
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:27,435
你想剥夺我的权利吗?
Are you challenging my authority?

254
00:28:27,565 --> 00:28:30,850
目前为止我们应该为这孩子考虑
As far as this baby
is concerned, yes.

255
00:28:30,984 --> 00:28:33,984
布尔格莱库特别听他的
Don't listen to him, Burglekutt.

256
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:39,147
好吧. 你自己呆在这,
我们要走了
Fine. You stay here alone,
but we're going.

257
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:43,196
这可不是个好主意,
呆在这外面很危险
That's a bad idea. Very bad.
Dangerous out there.

258
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:47,326
- 兄弟们拿着东西我们走
- 沃卡尔--
- Get the gear, men.
- Vohnkar--

259
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:52,582
- 这不是由他决定的!
- 布尔格莱库特你这团屎
- It's not his decision!
- Burglekutt, you're troll dung.

260
00:28:52,713 --> 00:28:56,496
- 你竟然允许他这么和你说话
- 听着矮人
- Don't let him talk to you that way.
- Listen here, runt.

261
00:28:56,633 --> 00:29:00,381
你再在这浪费时间,
你的地就别想有收成了
While you're wasting your time here,
your fields aren't getting planted.

262
00:29:00,512 --> 00:29:02,338
自己想想吧!
Think about it!

263
00:29:02,473 --> 00:29:06,600
- 布尔格莱库特, 我会--
- 你想怎么样?
- Burglekutt, I'm gonna--
- You're gonna what?

264
00:29:12,023 --> 00:29:14,857
某一天, 布尔格莱库特.
总有一天
Someday, Burglekutt.
Someday.

265
00:29:14,984 --> 00:29:16,892
沃卡尔, 走吧!
Vohnkar, let's go!

266
00:29:20,448 --> 00:29:23,365
米戈什, 你走不走?
Meegosh, are you coming?

267
00:29:25,661 --> 00:29:27,285
我不走
I'm staying.

268
00:29:27,412 --> 00:29:29,203
我们走吧
Come on, men.

269
00:29:29,331 --> 00:29:33,458
布尔格莱库特, 放我出去
我发誓我会照顾这孩子的
Burglekutt, let me out of here.
I'll take care of the baby, I swear.

270
00:29:34,294 --> 00:29:36,333
放我出去吧
求你了!
Just let me out of here.
Please!

271
00:29:36,463 --> 00:29:39,748
沃卡尔, 借给我你的矛用一下
Vohnkar, let me borrow that spear
just for a minute.

272
00:29:39,882 --> 00:29:42,088
算了, 至少给我点水!
Well, at least get me some water!

273
00:29:42,218 --> 00:29:45,135
布尔格莱库特, 别把我一个人丢下!
Burglekutt, don't leave me alone
with these two!

274
00:29:49,642 --> 00:29:51,966
威洛我们现在怎么办?
What'll we do now, Willow?

275
00:29:52,102 --> 00:29:54,675
侏儒你真的很蠢
Well, that was really stupid, peck.

276
00:29:54,813 --> 00:29:59,557
- 不要叫我侏儒
- 哦, 对不起侏儒
- Don't call me a peck.
- Oh, I'm sorry, peck.

277
00:29:59,692 --> 00:30:03,392
- 侏儒, 侏儒, 侏儒, 侏儒
- 你小心点!
- Peck, peck, peck, peck.
- You be careful!

278
00:30:04,322 --> 00:30:07,156
我是有魔力的巫师
看到这些果子了吗?
I'm a powerful sorcerer.
See this acorn?

279
00:30:08,701 --> 00:30:11,405
如果我用它们丢你, 你会变成石头
I'll throw it at you
and turn you to stone.

280
00:30:13,288 --> 00:30:15,161
我真的很怕
I'm really scared.

281
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:17,788
不, 不要, 不要!
No, don't! Don't!

282
00:30:17,918 --> 00:30:21,001
这有个侏儒要用橡树果砸我!
There's a peck here
with an acorn pointed at me!

283
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,753
我不想浪费!
I wouldn't want to waste it!

284
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,713
侏儒, 侏儒, 侏儒, 侏儒!
Peck, peck, peck, peck!

285
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:01,158
刚刚是什么?
What was that?

286
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:07,125
小伙子们早上好
Mornin', boys.

287
00:31:08,424 --> 00:31:11,507
昨晚, 很难熬的一晚不是吗?
Rough night last night,
wasn't it?

288
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,922
我想我昨天忘记自我介绍了
I don't think
I introduced myself yesterday.

289
00:31:16,056 --> 00:31:19,471
我叫默得马迪根,
你们呢--
My name is Madmartigan,
and you are, uh--

290
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:21,640
别过去, 米戈什.
No, Meegosh.

291
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:24,058
别靠近他
他很危险
Don't go near him.
He's dangerous.

292
00:31:24,188 --> 00:31:26,014
我不危险
I am not.

293
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,225
好极了
Good.

294
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,236
停! 等一下!
Stop! Wait!

295
00:31:46,084 --> 00:31:48,752
- 出什么事了?
- 可能有战争了
- What's going on?
- Smells like a battle.

296
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,372
我希望你是个战士
I suppose you're a warrior.

297
00:31:52,507 --> 00:31:54,962
我曾经是个最好的剑客
I am the greatest swordsman
that ever lived.

298
00:31:57,971 --> 00:32:01,588
能给我点水吗?
Say, could I have
some of that water?

299
00:32:11,442 --> 00:32:13,730
我也不知道为什么我还找你要
I don't know why I try.

300
00:32:21,492 --> 00:32:24,196
我想我会死在这
谁会管我?
I guess I am gonna die here.
Who cares?

301
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:26,202
- 给
- 谢谢你
- Here.
- Thanks, friend.

302
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:29,872
那是什么?
What's that?

303
00:32:30,001 --> 00:32:32,705
我想应该有200到300匹马...
I'd say
two or three hundred horses...

304
00:32:32,836 --> 00:32:36,749
5到6个货车,
还有1000多的白痴士兵.
five or six wagons,
and about a thousand fools.

305
00:32:40,886 --> 00:32:43,257
- 谢谢你
- 米戈什快走
- Thank you.
- Come on, Meegosh.

306
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,348
宝贝没事的
It's gonna be all right,
little bobbin.

307
00:32:59,362 --> 00:33:01,188
一切都会好的
Everything's gonna be all right.

308
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:07,569
- 先生打扰一下
- 滚开, 侏儒!
- Excuse me, sir.
- Out of the way, peck!

309
00:33:10,664 --> 00:33:12,739
打扰一下
Pardon me.

310
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:21,546
先生打搅一下
Excuse me, sir.

311
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:25,000
我们在村子里发现了你们的孩子
We found one of your babies
in our village.

312
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,970
你能照顾她吗?
Will you please take care of her?

313
00:33:29,056 --> 00:33:32,389
我们要去打仗
去找个女人来照顾吧
We're going into battle, little ones.
Find a woman to take care of her.

314
00:33:33,602 --> 00:33:36,057
埃尔克 他们以为你是女人
They thought you were
a woman, Airk.

315
00:33:37,189 --> 00:33:39,513
有意思--
Well--

316
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,140
默得马迪根!
这次你又犯什么错了?
Madmartigan!
What did you do this time?

317
00:33:42,277 --> 00:33:44,185
你在从来没干过的
Nothing you wouldn't have done
in my place.

318
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,810
我知道你最终总会被关在笼子里
I always knew
you'd end up in a crow's cage.

319
00:33:46,948 --> 00:33:50,114
至少我没去赶羊
你们去北部作什么?
At least I'm not herding sheep.
What are you doing this far north?

320
00:33:50,243 --> 00:33:53,160
诺克马尔军队在攻打格拉敦
The Nockmaar army
destroyed Galladoorn.

321
00:33:53,287 --> 00:33:54,911
城堡?
The castle?

322
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,031
巴夫莫达的军队摧毁了所有东西
Bavmorda's troops are crushing
everything in sight.

323
00:33:57,166 --> 00:33:59,039
快点
我要离开这里，埃尔克
Come on.
Let me out of here, Airk.

324
00:33:59,168 --> 00:34:01,326
给我一把剑
我会战胜的
Give me a sword.
I'll win this war for you.

325
00:34:01,461 --> 00:34:05,837
默得马迪根,
我始终为格拉敦效力
Madmartigan,
I still serve Galladoorn.

326
00:34:05,966 --> 00:34:07,874
你不为任何人效力
You serve no one.

327
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:10,216
记得吗?
Remember?

328
00:34:10,345 --> 00:34:12,384
坐在里面直到腐烂吧
Sit in your coffin and rot.

329
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:16,639
埃尔克等一下, 你需要我!
Wait, Airk. You need me!

330
00:34:16,767 --> 00:34:19,138
你死后过段时间我会回来的!
I'll be around
long after you're dead!

331
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,843
我出去以后我会把你脑袋割下来的...
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna cut your head off...

332
00:34:21,981 --> 00:34:24,020
然后栓在猪尾巴上!
and stick it on a pig pole!

333
00:34:43,626 --> 00:34:46,163
我想念嘉叶和孩子们
I miss Kiaya and the bobbins.

334
00:34:50,675 --> 00:34:52,714
我们的食物不多了
We're running out of food.

335
00:34:55,554 --> 00:34:57,760
没人会照顾那孩子的
Nobody's gonna
take care of that baby.

336
00:34:57,889 --> 00:35:00,723
知道为什么吗?
没人理会这件事
You know why?
Nobody cares.

337
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,809
除了我
Except me.

338
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:11,523
你想回家
我想从这笼子里出去
You want to go back to your families.
I want out of this cage.

339
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:15,565
让我照顾这孩子吧
我会把她当成自己孩子一样照顾的
Let me take care of that baby.
I'll look after her like she was my own.

340
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:18,614
威洛我相信他会的
I believe he would, Willow.

341
00:35:18,743 --> 00:35:21,233
他跟本不懂该怎么照顾孩子
He doesn't know anything
about babies.

342
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:26,539
没错, 但是我知道很多女人知道的
Right, but I know
a lot of women who do.

343
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,534
如果我有一个孩子...
If I had somebody in my life...

344
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,207
假如是个一个小女孩...
a little daughter, perhaps...

345
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,506
我也许就有活下去的理由了
I might have a reason
to go on living.

346
00:35:39,845 --> 00:35:42,964
你们不能把我留在这等死
You can't leave me
in here to die.

347
00:35:43,098 --> 00:35:45,719
我只是想保护她
Not when all I want to do
is protect her.

348
00:35:59,113 --> 00:36:02,944
感觉好极了!
I feel better!

349
00:36:03,076 --> 00:36:06,740
-你做了一件很正确地事情!
-好的. 我知道.
-You've done the right thing!
-Okay. All right.

350
00:36:06,871 --> 00:36:08,779
你要保证抚养她
You gotta promise to feed her.

351
00:36:08,914 --> 00:36:11,285
小宝贝儿来爸爸这里
Come to Daddy, little darlin'.

352
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:14,583
- 让她保持清洁
- 没问题
- And keep her clean.
- Absolutely.

353
00:36:24,971 --> 00:36:26,797
她喜欢我
She likes me.

354
00:36:28,934 --> 00:36:31,258
这些是她的尿布
Here are her changing rags.

355
00:36:31,394 --> 00:36:33,516
- 这个是奶瓶
- 还有奶吗?
- And her milk bladder.
- Any milk in there?

356
00:36:33,688 --> 00:36:37,815
- 这些是给她的!
- 我不会偷吃孩子的东西的
- It's for her!
- I wouldn't steal from a baby.

357
00:36:40,777 --> 00:36:43,148
侏儒你担心的太多了
You worry too much, peck.

358
00:36:43,281 --> 00:36:46,400
- 他叫威洛.
- 我想说的就是威洛.
- It's Willow.
- I mean Willow.

359
00:36:47,784 --> 00:36:50,701
听着-- 威洛.
Now listen, boys-- Willow.

360
00:36:50,829 --> 00:36:52,987
你这么做很对
You've done the right thing.

361
00:36:53,122 --> 00:36:56,371
现在你们回家去种地吧
Now I want you to get home
and bring your crop in.

362
00:37:02,548 --> 00:37:04,872
小宝贝儿再见了
Goodbye, little one.

363
00:37:16,061 --> 00:37:18,100
请你好好带她
Please take good care of her.

364
00:37:20,482 --> 00:37:22,770
我心里你是英雄!
I give you my word of honour!

365
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:33,401
- 米戈什, 慢点!
- 哦, 快点吧!
- Meegosh, slow down!
- Oh, come on!

366
00:37:33,536 --> 00:37:35,991
如果我们快点, 明天早上我们就到了
If we hurry, we could be home
by tomorrow morning.

367
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:38,789
我们是英雄
We'll be heroes.

368
00:37:38,915 --> 00:37:41,286
- 你真的这么认为吗?
- 当然
- Do you really think so?
- Sure.

369
00:37:41,418 --> 00:37:43,624
"看啊威洛和米戈什回来了
"Look, there's Willow and Meegosh.

370
00:37:43,754 --> 00:37:45,960
英雄回家了"
The heroes have come home."

371
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:49,089
"欢迎你们回来
这是你们应得的勋章!"
"Welcome back, boys.
You deserve medals!"

372
00:37:49,217 --> 00:37:51,505
对啊, 勋章!
Yeah, medals!

373
00:37:59,227 --> 00:38:01,634
我们这么做对吗?
Did we do the right thing?

374
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:04,604
当然
没有什么可担心的
Absolutely.
There's nothing to worry about.

375
00:38:13,031 --> 00:38:18,190
我偷到了一个孩子! 我偷到了一个孩子!
I stole the baby! I stole the baby!

376
00:38:20,746 --> 00:38:24,079
那是我的孩子!
站住! 等一下! 回来!
That's my baby!
Stop! Wait! Come back!

377
00:38:24,209 --> 00:38:27,244
向左, 笨鸟. 左边!
Left, you stupid bird. Left!

378
00:38:33,925 --> 00:38:36,213
是棕种人!
快走!
Brownies!
Let's get out of here!

379
00:38:37,303 --> 00:38:40,469
米戈什快走!
Come on, Meegosh!

380
00:38:46,646 --> 00:38:48,685
我们快跑出去了!
We'll outrun 'em!

381
00:38:53,444 --> 00:38:55,483
嘿, 丑八怪, 起来!
Hey, ugly, wake up!

382
00:39:03,161 --> 00:39:05,319
站在那别动
他们是咱们的囚犯
Stand your ground.
These are our prisoners.

383
00:39:05,455 --> 00:39:08,206
米戈什孩子呢?
Meegosh, where's the baby?

384
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:11,499
- 把奈尔人给我带过来
- 好了, 你听到她说的了!
- Bring the Nelwyns to me.
- All right, you heard her!

385
00:39:11,628 --> 00:39:15,328
- 这是怎么回事?
- 闭嘴, 要不然我打烂你的鼻子
- What's going on?
- Shut up, or I'll break your nose.

386
00:39:15,465 --> 00:39:17,789
你们是我的玩具
You are mine to toy with.

387
00:39:18,884 --> 00:39:21,374
前进!
Forward!

388
00:39:22,472 --> 00:39:24,380
拿着绳子
Get the rope.

389
00:39:26,934 --> 00:39:31,678
你从哪弄来的孩子?
Where did you get that baby?

390
00:39:31,813 --> 00:39:35,311
从一个愚蠢的戴基尼人那弄来的
I stole it from a stupid Daikini.

391
00:39:37,903 --> 00:39:42,528
弗朗杰放了奈尔人
别再折磨他们了
Franjean, release the Nelwyns,
and stop pestering them.

392
00:39:59,422 --> 00:40:01,461
欢迎来到我的国度
Welcome to my kingdom.

393
00:40:09,432 --> 00:40:13,892
- 威洛・阿福古德很高兴见到你
- 你怎么知道我的名字?
- I'm happy to meet you, Willow Ufgood.
- How do you know my name?

394
00:40:14,687 --> 00:40:17,224
埃洛拉・达南告诉我的
Elora Danan told me.

395
00:40:17,356 --> 00:40:20,522
埃洛拉?
埃洛拉, 威洛来了
Elora?
Elora, Willow is here.

396
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:28,946
- 但她只是个孩子
- 她很特别
- But she's just a baby.
- She's very special.

397
00:40:29,075 --> 00:40:33,487
我的棕人们从她一出生就开始找她
My Brownies have been searching for her
ever since we heard she was born.

398
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:39,376
埃洛拉・达南选择你来保护她
Elora Danan has chosen you
to be her guardian.

399
00:40:39,502 --> 00:40:40,960
我?
Me?

400
00:40:41,087 --> 00:40:44,502
是的, 她喜欢你
Yes. She likes you.

401
00:40:45,674 --> 00:40:50,584
埃洛拉知道你有勇气保护她
And Elora Danan knows
you have the courage to help us.

402
00:40:50,721 --> 00:40:54,255
拿着我的法杖去找芬・罗洁爱尔巫师
Take my wand
to the sorceress Fin Raziel.

403
00:40:54,391 --> 00:40:58,601
她会带着你和埃洛拉・达南
去特尔阿斯伦之国...
She will guide you and Elora Danan
to the kingdom of Tir Asleen...

404
00:40:58,728 --> 00:41:01,763
那有一对很好的国王和王后会照顾她的
where a good king and queen
will look after her.

405
00:41:01,898 --> 00:41:05,562
你应该找一个勇士来完成这个任务
我什么也不是
You need a warrior
for a job like this. I'm a nobody.

406
00:41:05,693 --> 00:41:09,026
埃洛拉, 你不需要我去
Elora, you don't want me.

407
00:41:09,155 --> 00:41:12,772
告诉她
我很矮, 只是个奈尔人
Tell her.
I'm short, even for a Nelwyn.

408
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:19,118
喂?
Hello?

409
00:41:25,795 --> 00:41:29,128
埃洛拉・达南必须活着!
Elora Danan must survive!

410
00:41:29,257 --> 00:41:31,296
她必须完成她的使命...
She must fulfil her destiny...

411
00:41:31,426 --> 00:41:34,094
然后让巴夫莫达女王衰败...
and bring about the downfall
of Queen Bavmorda...

412
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,971
这个女王的能力像一个魔鬼一样在不断增长
whose powers are growing
like an evil plague.

413
00:41:37,098 --> 00:41:41,426
除非阻止她...
Unless she is stopped,
Bavmorda will control the lives...

414
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,687
否则巴夫莫达女王会控制你们的村子,
你们的孩子-- 和你们每一个人
of your village,
your children-- everyone.

415
00:41:50,777 --> 00:41:54,227
威洛, 所有正义之士需要你的帮助
All creatures of good heart
need your help, Willow.

416
00:41:55,615 --> 00:41:58,105
你来选择吧
The choice is yours.

417
00:42:22,724 --> 00:42:25,973
嘿, 米戈什醒醒
Hey, Meegosh. Wake up.

418
00:42:26,894 --> 00:42:29,929
- 该回家了
- 回家?
- It's time to go home.
- Home?

419
00:42:33,943 --> 00:42:35,982
听着, 米戈什.
Listen, Meegosh.

420
00:42:36,111 --> 00:42:39,561
告诉嘉叶我爱她, 而且每天都在想她
Tell Kiaya I love her
and I think of her every day.

421
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:44,945
也告诉她我会保护这个孩子的
And tell her I'm not going to let
anything happen to the baby.

422
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:47,652
你确定你在做什么吗?
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

423
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,664
希望如此
I hope so.

424
00:42:52,168 --> 00:42:54,243
听着, 自己当心
Listen, be careful.

425
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:04,801
- 弗朗杰我知道改怎么走
- 你总认为你知道
- I know the way, Franjean.
- You always think you know the way.

426
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:06,756
我是这儿的头儿!
I am the leader!

427
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:09,511
- 到罗洁爱尔还要多久?
- 快了
- How long will it take to find Raziel?
- Not long.

428
00:43:09,643 --> 00:43:12,976
她将被放逐到这几座山后的一个小岛上
She's been exiled to an island
just over those hills.

429
00:43:13,105 --> 00:43:15,975
- 她将被怎样?
- 放逐
- She's what?
- Exiled.

430
00:43:16,107 --> 00:43:19,190
被巴夫莫达女王放逐
By the evil Queen Bavmorda.

431
00:43:20,278 --> 00:43:22,851
鲁尔, 你这个笨蛋, 他没有必要知道这些!
Rool, you fool. He does not need
to know everything!

432
00:43:22,988 --> 00:43:25,525
- 我没和他说
- 你倒是和他说了不少
- I didn't tell him everything.
- You told him enough.

433
00:43:25,658 --> 00:43:28,907
小岛是你说的,
女王的事也是你说的
You mentioned the island,
you mentioned the queen.

434
00:43:29,287 --> 00:43:30,615
那又怎样?
So?

435
00:43:30,746 --> 00:43:33,497
你们什么意思?
在说什么, 神秘的小岛是什么?
What do you mean? What are
you saying, mysterious island?

436
00:43:33,624 --> 00:43:36,197
别玩儿那个法杖
Don't play with that wand.

437
00:43:36,334 --> 00:43:38,824
车林德瑞亚告诉你了法杖有巨大的法力
Cherlindrea told you
it holds vast powers.

438
00:43:38,962 --> 00:43:44,204
只有伟大的法师才能用,
而不是向你这样的侏儒
Only a great sorcerer can use it,
not a stupid peck like you.

439
00:43:44,342 --> 00:43:47,425
- 这边
- 不. 不. 不是. 我想不是这边
- This way.
- No. No. No. I don't think so.

440
00:43:47,553 --> 00:43:49,794
- 好吧, 那走这边
- 也不行
- All right, then this way.
- Nope.

441
00:43:49,931 --> 00:43:52,421
- 这边
- 这边?
- This way.
- This way?

442
00:43:52,558 --> 00:43:56,222
- 对啊没错
- 这条路
- That's what I said.
- This way.

443
00:43:56,354 --> 00:43:58,262
你们确定你们要去哪里吗?
Are you sure you know
where you're going?

444
00:43:58,397 --> 00:44:02,524
当然. 跟着我们这些向导走,
没有什么可以伤害你的
Of course. With us as your guides,
no harm will befall you.

445
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:21,325
我们不能去那!
We are not going in there!

446
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,377
但是埃洛拉需要新鲜的牛奶,
而且我们全身湿透了
But Elora needs fresh milk,
and we're drenched.

447
00:44:24,505 --> 00:44:27,790
矮个子你不是指挥官, 我是!
You are not in command
here, shorty. I am!

448
00:44:27,925 --> 00:44:29,964
你听我说话了吗?
You hear me?

449
00:45:09,297 --> 00:45:11,668
打扰一下? 对不起
Excuse me? Excuse me.

450
00:45:11,799 --> 00:45:14,716
能不能分给我些奶给这个可怜的饥饿的孩子?
Could you spare some milk
for this poor, hungry baby?

451
00:45:14,844 --> 00:45:16,635
侏儒滚开!
Get out of here, peck!

452
00:45:16,762 --> 00:45:19,548
滚开要不然我们吃了你!
Get outta here or we'll cook ya!

453
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:36,358
看看她!
Look at her!

454
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:38,696
我可以给她用一点爱情之水!
I could use a love potion on her!

455
00:45:38,825 --> 00:45:42,608
弗朗杰! 把那碎心之尘
给我
Franjean! Give me
that dust of broken heart.

456
00:45:42,745 --> 00:45:44,404
快点! 给我!
Come on! Give it to me!

457
00:45:44,538 --> 00:45:47,823
这样很危险
这是仙女的东西!
It's very dangerous.
It belongs to the fairies!

458
00:45:51,962 --> 00:45:54,037
嘿, 安静!
你想我们死啊?
Hey, quiet!
You want to get us killed?

459
00:46:01,054 --> 00:46:05,762
哦, 鲁尔! 你总玩儿仙女的爱情之水
Oh, Rool! Always playing
with those fairy love potions.

460
00:46:09,437 --> 00:46:11,808
你真漂亮!
You are so beautiful!

461
00:46:13,399 --> 00:46:15,889
你的眼睛!
你的须子!
Your eyes!
Your whiskers!

462
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:20,438
- 我想亲你!
- 鲁尔! 那是碎心之尘!
- I have to kiss you!
- Rool! That dust of broken heart!

463
00:46:35,378 --> 00:46:37,204
啤酒!
Beer!

464
00:46:40,674 --> 00:46:42,713
这些人都疯了!
这太不好了!
These people are crazy!
This could be bad!

465
00:46:47,348 --> 00:46:51,261
快! 快!
我丈夫来了!
Hurry! Hurry!
My husband's coming!

466
00:46:51,393 --> 00:46:53,385
如果他看到你在这,
他会杀了咱们!
If he catches you here,
he'll kill us both!

467
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,093
- 看起来还行吧?
- 哦是你!
- How do I look?
- Not you!

468
00:46:57,357 --> 00:46:59,230
你从哪冒出来的?
Where the hell did you come from?

469
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,564
我就知道我不该信你
I knew I shouldn't
have trusted you.

470
00:47:01,695 --> 00:47:03,189
我认识你吗?
Don't I know you?

471
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:06,938
戴基尼人, 在你小便的时候,
我从你那里把孩子偷走的!
I stole the baby from you, Daikini,
while you were taking a pee-pee!

472
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:10,109
- 把你的头盖好!
- 你和棕人一起爬进来的
- Cover your face!
- You are crawling with Brownies.

473
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,948
我讨厌棕人!
I hate Brownies!

474
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,989
- 他在哪?
- 嗨, 亲爱的
- Where is he?
- Hello, dear.

475
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:19,450
这没有人, 除了我的--
There's nobody here
but me and, uh, my--

476
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,910
- 我杀了他!
- 我的表亲希尔达
- I'll kill him!
- my cousin, Hilda.

477
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:24,253
希尔达?
Hilda?

478
00:47:24,382 --> 00:47:27,086
希尔达, 这是我丈夫陆格.
Hilda, this is my husband, Llug.

479
00:47:27,218 --> 00:47:29,293
大块头丈夫
你好?
Big husband.
How do you do?

480
00:47:33,766 --> 00:47:37,928
- 过来女孩, 别害羞
- 拿回来!
- Come on, girly. Don't be shy.
- Give her back!

481
00:47:38,687 --> 00:47:41,011
- 侏儒来当保姆
- 保姆?
- Pecks make such terrible nursemaids.
- Nursemaid?

482
00:47:41,148 --> 00:47:43,187
很意外的得到的
They get too excited.

483
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,683
请问!
我们有酒会吗?
Excuse me!
Are we having a party?

484
00:47:50,448 --> 00:47:52,321
请安静
Stop, please.

485
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:56,613
快点
像个男人一样打一场!
Come on.
Fight like a man!

486
00:47:56,746 --> 00:47:58,572
要喂她奶吗?
Want to breed?

487
00:47:58,707 --> 00:48:01,660
试了, 好像不用
Tempting, but no.

488
00:48:05,045 --> 00:48:07,618
- 谢谢你. 该走了
- 希尔达再见!
- Thank you. Time to leave.
- Bye, Hilda!

489
00:48:07,756 --> 00:48:09,831
把他们带出去!
Take them out!

490
00:48:11,009 --> 00:48:14,424
从哪来的回哪去!
Come along! Move along!

491
00:48:14,555 --> 00:48:17,223
把这些孩子抓起来
Gather up all these babies.

492
00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:19,590
那个孩子
让我看看她的胳膊
That baby over there.
Let me see its arm.

493
00:48:23,354 --> 00:48:25,429
不是
That's not the one.

494
00:48:29,193 --> 00:48:31,897
你! 你是那个孩子的妈妈吗?
You! Are you the mother
of that child?

495
00:48:32,029 --> 00:48:34,566
- 是的我是
- 让我看看
- Yes, I am.
- Let me see it.

496
00:48:34,698 --> 00:48:36,239
不! 别让她看!
No! Don't let her!

497
00:48:37,909 --> 00:48:40,695
女士我命令你!
I gave you an order, woman!

498
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:53,540
你真漂亮!
You're beautiful!

499
00:48:53,674 --> 00:48:56,959
- 你也很结实
- 谢谢
- And you're very strong.
- Thank you.

500
00:48:59,972 --> 00:49:03,007
你不是女人!
You're no woman!

501
00:49:03,142 --> 00:49:04,968
- 不是女人?
- 先生...
- Not a woman?
- Gentlemen...

502
00:49:05,102 --> 00:49:06,893
不是女人?
Not a woman?

503
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,679
陆格冷静
meet Llug.

504
00:49:11,108 --> 00:49:13,100
- 抓住他们!
- 闪开!
- After them!
- Out of the way!

505
00:49:19,448 --> 00:49:20,610
上马!
To the horses!

506
00:49:33,211 --> 00:49:37,042
默得马迪根!
默得马迪根! 等等!
Madmartigan!
Madmartigan! Wait!

507
00:49:40,594 --> 00:49:43,001
他不是女人!
He's not a woman!

508
00:49:49,602 --> 00:49:52,970
默得马迪根, 停下!
Madmartigan, stop!

509
00:50:11,998 --> 00:50:14,453
默得马迪根, 我警告你--
Madmartigan, I'm warning you--

510
00:50:17,795 --> 00:50:20,166
准备好死了!
Prepare to die!

511
00:50:43,611 --> 00:50:45,899
默得马迪根! 停下!
Madmartigan! Stop!

512
00:51:01,961 --> 00:51:05,080
没有啤酒了
No more beer.

513
00:51:16,016 --> 00:51:18,008
弗朗杰, 救命!
Franjean, help me!

514
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:25,560
- 鲁尔! 鲁尔!
- 救命!
- Rool! Rool!
- Help!

515
00:51:29,195 --> 00:51:32,645
- 鲁尔! 你干什么呢?
- 救我!
- Rool! What are you doing?
- Help me!

516
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,285
- 快点
- 把我拉进去
- Come on.
- Pull me in.

517
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:20,948
鲁尔, 这一点都不好玩儿!
帮我把绳子砍断!
Rool, this isn't funny!
Help me cut the rope!

518
00:52:58,446 --> 00:53:00,983
威洛, 向后退!
Willow, stay down!

519
00:53:04,744 --> 00:53:06,736
吁!
Whoa!

520
00:53:09,206 --> 00:53:11,032
你疯了吗?
Have you gone crazy?

521
00:53:11,166 --> 00:53:13,241
你不能带着埃洛拉这样跑
You can't chase around
with Elora like this.

522
00:53:13,376 --> 00:53:15,747
我们快掉下去了!
We're getting off!

523
00:53:49,411 --> 00:53:51,984
侏儒现在我们可以停了
Now we stop, peck.

524
00:53:53,164 --> 00:53:55,619
愚蠢的戴基尼人!
Stupid Daikini!

525
00:53:55,749 --> 00:53:58,417
别让他驾马车了
Ask him to stop the wagon.

526
00:53:58,544 --> 00:54:02,671
默得马迪根! 车上有婴儿你不应该驾这么快!
Madmartigan! You never, ever
drive that fast with an infant!

527
00:54:04,466 --> 00:54:06,672
我保住了孩子的命!
I just saved that infant's life!

528
00:54:10,638 --> 00:54:12,511
拿着你的东西. 快
Gather your wits. Come on.

529
00:54:12,641 --> 00:54:15,594
- 别担心我很好!
- 快!
- Don't worry about me. I'm fine!
- Come on!

530
00:54:17,604 --> 00:54:18,848
爬下!
Get down!

531
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:21,304
我在哪?
Where am I?

532
00:54:23,275 --> 00:54:25,314
鲁尔, 你个白痴,
滚出这条路！
Rool, you fool,
get out of the road!

533
00:54:43,086 --> 00:54:45,920
威洛, 在那些兵回来之前
你们最好快点离开
You better clear out, Willow,
before those troops come back.

534
00:54:46,047 --> 00:54:49,462
- 我的头!
- 埃洛拉我们不需要他
- My head!
- We don't need him, Elora.

535
00:54:57,892 --> 00:54:59,931
默得马迪根, 等一下!
Madmartigan, wait!

536
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:03,345
威洛回家吧!
这太危险
Go home, Willow!
It's a dangerous world.

537
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,388
我知道, 这也是我要你帮忙的原因
Yeah, and that's why
we need your help.

538
00:55:05,523 --> 00:55:08,689
我帮你?
想要我帮你什么?
My help?
What do you need my help for?

539
00:55:08,818 --> 00:55:10,893
你是个法师!
You're a sorcerer!

540
00:55:11,029 --> 00:55:14,231
你是个很好的马夫也是个很好的剑客
You're a great warrior
and a swordsman.

541
00:55:14,365 --> 00:55:17,199
你比我高10倍, 白痴!
And you're ten times
bigger than I am, stupid!

542
00:55:18,369 --> 00:55:21,535
你还想让我的生活更麻烦吗?
Are you trying to make my life
more difficult than it already is?

543
00:55:26,127 --> 00:55:28,700
快点! 大狗来了!
Hurry! Big dogs!

544
00:55:28,837 --> 00:55:32,999
对不起我很饿
Look. I'm sorry I got angry.

545
00:55:33,133 --> 00:55:35,041
我们逃亡不能没有你
We wouldn't have escaped
without you.

546
00:55:49,273 --> 00:55:52,059
我再帮你一次.
Well, don't expect me
to help you again.

547
00:55:53,611 --> 00:55:57,193
好极了! 我们走这条路!
去湖边!
Good! Then we go that way!
To the lake!

548
00:55:59,241 --> 00:56:01,696
那条路
That way.

549
00:56:01,826 --> 00:56:05,075
你喝多了, 你忘了吗, 你一喝醉...
You are drunk, and when
you are drunk, you forget that...

550
00:56:05,204 --> 00:56:07,077
- 我来决定!
- 你来决定
- I am in charge!
- You are in charge.

551
00:56:07,207 --> 00:56:09,365
好
走哪条路?
Fine.
Then which way do we go?

552
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:13,034
那条!
That way!

553
00:56:14,547 --> 00:56:19,042
哦, 不!
那是我要走的路
Oh, no!
That's the way I'm going.

554
00:56:19,176 --> 00:56:22,093
好了, 好了
我带你们去湖边
All right, all right.
You can follow me as far as the lake.

555
00:56:22,221 --> 00:56:24,343
仅此而已!
But that's it!

556
00:56:24,473 --> 00:56:28,173
- 你不去南边吧?
- 不, 到湖边就好
- You're not going south, are you?
- No, just as far as the lake.

557
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:29,679
好
Good.

558
00:56:29,811 --> 00:56:33,428
蒙博,占博, 我饿了
给我找点鸡蛋或者别的什么
Mumbo,Jumbo, I am hungry.
Go get me some eggs or something.

559
00:56:33,564 --> 00:56:36,137
- 我们不怕你!
- 现在!
- We are not afraid of you!
- Now!

560
00:56:42,907 --> 00:56:46,441
凯尔, 找到孩子了吗?
Kael, have you found the child?

561
00:56:47,661 --> 00:56:50,329
女王我们在继续找
The search goes on, my queen.

562
00:56:50,456 --> 00:56:52,448
为什么用我的法力...
Why, with my powers...

563
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:55,749
加上我强大的军队...
with the strength
of my great army...

564
00:56:55,877 --> 00:56:59,210
你们能找到一个小孩儿吗?
can you not find
one little child?

565
00:56:59,339 --> 00:57:01,627
我们还在找
快找到了
We look even now.
It won't be long.

566
00:57:01,757 --> 00:57:05,090
找到那孩子
找到那孩子!
Find the child.
Find the child!

567
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,757
没时间了
Time is running out.

568
00:57:15,604 --> 00:57:18,094
- 晚安
- 你很可爱
- Good night.
- She is kinda cute.

569
00:57:19,859 --> 00:57:21,566
当她安静的时候
When she's quiet.

570
00:57:23,028 --> 00:57:24,901
她真的是公主
She's really a princess.

571
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:28,813
真的?
你是个伟大的巫师
Really?
And you're a great sorcerer.

572
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:30,989
那我就是克什米尔国王
And I'm the king of Kashmir.

573
00:57:31,952 --> 00:57:34,240
威洛去睡觉吧
Go to sleep, Willow.

574
00:57:34,998 --> 00:57:37,453
晚安默得马迪根.
Good night, Madmartigan.

575
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:40,500
老鼠! 大老鼠! 老鼠啊!
Rats! Big rats! Rats!

576
00:57:41,295 --> 00:57:43,287
老鼠!
Rats!

577
00:57:44,047 --> 00:57:48,838
鲁尔, 你在做老鼠梦!
Rool, you and
that stupid rat dream!

578
00:57:57,727 --> 00:58:00,431
Tuatha... (咒语)
Tuatha...

579
00:58:00,563 --> 00:58:02,638
lawkathok... (咒语)
lawkathok...

580
00:58:02,774 --> 00:58:04,647
tuatha! (咒语)
tuatha!

581
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:16,903
- 你在那
- 默得马迪根!
- There you are.
- Madmartigan!

582
00:58:18,372 --> 00:58:20,328
'晚安, 威洛.
'Night, Willow.

583
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,418
这边! 这边!
This way! This way!

584
00:58:46,315 --> 00:58:48,188
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

585
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,640
我找到了些植物的根
她很喜欢!
I found some black root.
She loves it!

586
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,647
职务的根?
我是两个孩子的爸爸...
Black root?
I am the father of two children...

587
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,688
而你却没有孩子, 你怎么知道可以吃根的
and you never, ever
give a baby black root.

588
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:58,989
我妈妈用这些根把我们养大的
My mother raised us
on black root.

589
00:58:59,117 --> 00:59:01,607
对身体好!
它能让你长胸毛
It's good for ya!
It puts hair on your chest.

590
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:04,414
- 不是吗, 斯替克斯?
- 她不叫斯替克斯
- Doesn't it, Sticks?
- Her name is not Sticks.

591
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:07,410
她叫埃洛拉・达南,
特尔阿斯伦以后的女皇
She's Elora Danan,
the future empress of Tir Asleen.

592
00:59:07,542 --> 00:59:09,830
最后一点她不想要胸毛!
And the last thing she's gonna want
is a hairy chest!

593
00:59:14,383 --> 00:59:17,833
你看到他作什么了么?
他偷了我们的树根
Did you see what he did?
He stole our black root.

594
00:59:17,969 --> 00:59:20,008
我再去弄点
别担心
I'll get some more.
Don't worry about it.

595
00:59:24,266 --> 00:59:26,507
在那! T小岛!
There it is! The island!

596
00:59:30,273 --> 00:59:33,107
我们成功了
We made it.

597
00:59:33,233 --> 00:59:36,268
我们把你带到芬・罗洁爱尔法师那里了
We have led you to the island
of the sorceress Fin Raziel.

598
00:59:36,403 --> 00:59:39,438
- 我们应该从村子里弄条船来
- 一条大船
- We'll get a boat in that village.
- A big boat.

599
00:59:58,758 --> 01:00:03,218
- 看起来好像是我带你们来的
- 你? 你作什么了?
- Well, looks like I got you here.
- You? What did you do?

600
01:00:03,345 --> 01:00:06,298
你只是在那里闲逛, 然后吃你的鸡蛋!
All you did was hang around
and eat our eggs!

601
01:00:06,431 --> 01:00:09,799
- 我找到了一条船
- 好极了
- I found a boat. We're all set.
- Good.

602
01:00:09,934 --> 01:00:12,341
把这两个蜥蜴扔出去淹死
Take these two lizards out
and drown them.

603
01:00:12,479 --> 01:00:15,764
蜥蜴?
你叫谁蜥蜴?
Lizards?
Who are you calling lizards?

604
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:20,568
你妈才是!
Your mother was a lizard!

605
01:00:23,572 --> 01:00:26,027
再见, 斯替克斯.
Goodbye, Sticks.

606
01:00:28,786 --> 01:00:31,620
如果你真的是个公主...
If you really are a princess...

607
01:00:31,747 --> 01:00:33,786
照顾他吧
take care of him.

608
01:00:41,715 --> 01:00:44,288
- 默得马迪根!
- 怎么了?
- Madmartigan!
- What?

609
01:00:45,301 --> 01:00:47,127
谢谢
Thanks.

610
01:00:58,439 --> 01:01:01,724
- 继续前进吧英雄!
- 别回头!
- Keep walkin', hero!
- Don't even turn around!

611
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,731
埃洛拉一切都很顺利
It's all right, Elora.

612
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:09,816
睡吧
没人能找到你
Go to sleep.
Nobody'll find you here.

613
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:12,487
我会和芬・罗洁爱尔一起回来的
很快
I'll be back with Fin Raziel
very soon.

614
01:01:12,619 --> 01:01:15,868
我们会用我们弱小的身体保护她的
We will guard her
with our meagre lives.

615
01:01:44,273 --> 01:01:46,099
罗洁爱尔!
Raziel!

616
01:01:47,151 --> 01:01:50,934
芬・罗洁爱尔!
求你, 我要和你谈谈!
Fin Raziel!
I have to talk to you, please!

617
01:02:02,749 --> 01:02:04,871
她不在这
She's not here.

618
01:02:12,868 --> 01:02:16,386
回来! 你是谁?
Get back! Who are you?

619
01:02:17,517 --> 01:02:20,339
你是谁?
Who are you?

620
01:02:22,832 --> 01:02:25,819
- 我是威洛・阿福古德
- 你来这干什么?
- I'm Willow Ufgood.
- What are you doing here?

621
01:02:25,946 --> 01:02:29,547
我是来找芬・罗洁爱尔法师的
I've come to find
the great sorceress Fin Raziel.

622
01:02:29,683 --> 01:02:32,209
我就是! 我是罗洁爱尔!
That's me! I'm Raziel!

623
01:02:34,249 --> 01:02:36,149
不可能!
This can't be right!

624
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:39,720
巴夫莫达的咒符把我变成这样的
One of Bavmorda's spells
transformed me.

625
01:02:42,056 --> 01:02:44,582
相信我,
我骗你毫无意义!
Believe me,
it could have been worse!

626
01:02:46,166 --> 01:02:50,440
好吧, 这个法杖是给你的
车林德瑞亚给你的
Well, this wand is for you.
It's from Cherlindrea.

627
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:52,715
这么说预言是真的
Then the prophecy is true.

628
01:02:52,851 --> 01:02:56,334
公主诞生了
带我去见她
The princess has been born.
Take me to her.

629
01:03:00,324 --> 01:03:03,559
她就是埃洛拉・达南
难道她不漂亮吗?
It is Elora Danan.
Isn't she beautiful?

630
01:03:05,431 --> 01:03:08,335
难道她不漂亮吗?
Isn't she beautiful?

631
01:03:08,462 --> 01:03:11,154
- 那就是罗洁爱尔?
- 我不知道
- That's Raziel?
- I don't know.

632
01:03:11,285 --> 01:03:14,142
我期待的是更伟大更庄严的
没有那么多的--
I expected something
more grand. Less--

633
01:03:14,274 --> 01:03:16,222
- 毛
- 毛
- Fuzzy.
- Fuzzy.

634
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:20,081
你必须用那个法杖
把我变回我的人形
You must use the wand.
Turn me back into my human form.

635
01:03:20,212 --> 01:03:23,482
- 我该怎么做?
- 你是说你不是法师?
- What do I do?
- You mean you're not a sorcerer?

636
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:27,216
是的. 可以这么说
Yes. Sorta.

637
01:03:27,353 --> 01:03:28,675
我是个农夫
I'm a farmer.

638
01:03:29,969 --> 01:03:32,626
- 但是我会些戏法
- 变戏法?
- But I do know a few tricks.
- Tricks?

639
01:03:32,751 --> 01:03:37,143
车林德瑞亚派你来?
你必须学会真正的魔法
Cherlindrea sent you?
You must learn real magic.

640
01:03:39,062 --> 01:03:41,340
- 马队!
- 马队来了!
- Horses!
- Horses!

641
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:43,748
快! 抓住她! 快!
Quick! Take her! Hurry!

642
01:03:52,763 --> 01:03:55,667
我早就知道他会叛变!
I knew he was a traitor!

643
01:03:58,326 --> 01:04:00,852
- 侏儒, 真对不起
- 你给我闭嘴
- Sorry about this, peck.
- Keep your mouth shut.

644
01:04:02,147 --> 01:04:04,708
我和你说过没有你我们也会找到他们的
I told you we'd find them
without your help.

645
01:04:04,845 --> 01:04:06,793
- 把孩子给我!
- 不行!
- Give me that baby!
- No!

646
01:04:10,284 --> 01:04:14,180
- 还给我!
- 离我远点! 别碰我!
- Give her back!
- Leave me alone! Don't touch me!

647
01:04:20,124 --> 01:04:21,942
这就是我们要找的
This is the one
we're looking for.

648
01:04:22,076 --> 01:04:24,106
我们必须把她带回诺克马尔
We must take it back
to Nockmaar.

649
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:30,085
你的裙子丢了?
Lose your skirt?

650
01:04:38,227 --> 01:04:41,214
- 这些账我会记着的
- 不会太久了
- I've still got what counts.
- Not for long.

651
01:04:47,859 --> 01:04:50,338
- 带他走
- 过来!
- Bring him.
- Over here!

652
01:05:09,034 --> 01:05:11,478
我们跟不上那些马车的
We'll never keep up
with those horses.

653
01:05:12,231 --> 01:05:15,253
- 那我们就慢慢跟着他们吧
- 那会花很长时间
- Then we will have to track them.
- That would take forever.

654
01:05:15,387 --> 01:05:17,948
再说, 就算我们找到他们我们也会被抓住...
Besides, even if we find them,
they'll catch us...

655
01:05:18,085 --> 01:05:21,237
然后把我们关到笼子里, 折磨我们,
最后把我们吃了
stick us in cages, torture us
and finally devour us.

656
01:05:21,365 --> 01:05:23,230
你是想说咱们回家吗?
Are you suggesting we go home?

657
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:26,097
- 不是. 这多有意思啊
- 那好
- Nah. This is more fun.
- All right.

658
01:05:26,223 --> 01:05:28,171
好吧, 那么
快走吧
Fine, then.
Come on.

659
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:45,394
我担心埃洛拉
她听起来不是很好
I'm worried about Elora.
She doesn't sound good.

"我爱你, 索尔沙"?

776
01:17:05,557 --> 01:17:07,929
我不爱她
她踢我的脸
I don't love her.
She kicked me in the face.

777
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:10,597

778
01:17:13,691 --> 01:17:16,063
凯尔! 凯尔!

I knew you'd get out
of that rattrap.

784
01:17:53,939 --> 01:17:55,896
埃尔克你丢下我等死
You left me to die, Airk.

785
01:17:56,025 --> 01:17:59,228
应该说我救了你

I probably saved your life.
We were slaughtered, and I lost a lot--

786
01:17:59,362 --> 01:18:00,275

789
01:18:07,995 --> 01:18:09,192
找到那孩子!
Find the child!

790
01:18:45,074 --> 01:18:48,027
告诉索尔沙
我搜北岸!
Tell Sorsha
I search the north bank!

791
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,357
是, 将军
Yes, General.

792
01:19:03,217 --> 01:19:05,209
安静!
Quiet!

793
01:19:24,656 --> 01:19:27,609
- 索尔沙!
- 退下
- Sorsha!
- Back.

794
01:19:28,243 --> 01:19:29,357
后退!
Back!

795
01:19:36,126 --> 01:19:37,406
后退
Back.

796
01:19:39,212 --> 01:19:42,212
- 让这孩子安静点
- 她应该被调个包
- Keep the baby quiet.
- She needs to be changed.

797
01:19:43,049 --> 01:19:44,875
- 诺克马尔, 你这个贱人!
- 你们永远不会打败我们的
- Nockmaar scum!
- You'll never defeat us.

798
01:19:45,009 --> 01:19:46,668
- 把孩子给我!
- 闭嘴!
- Give up the baby!
- Shut up!

799
01:19:48,763 --> 01:19:52,214
- 为什么巴夫莫达想要这孩子?
- 她是公主
- Why does Bavmorda want this baby?
- She's a princess.

800
01:19:52,351 --> 01:19:55,020
- 我们要把她带到特尔阿斯伦
- 特尔阿斯伦?
- We're taking her to Tir Asleen.
- Tir Asleen?

801
01:19:55,145 --> 01:19:57,102
侏儒, 就算你能找到那里...
Even if you could find it, peck...

802
01:19:57,230 --> 01:19:59,555
她说得对-- 你也不会击败诺克马尔的军队的
she's right-- you'd never
get past the Nockmaar army.

803
01:19:59,691 --> 01:20:03,522
如果我们能到那, 在特尔阿斯伦有一个更大的军队
There's an even bigger army
at Tir Asleen, if we can get there.

804
01:20:08,158 --> 01:20:10,862
我在和巴夫莫达的战争中损失了一半以上的部队
I've lost more than half my men
fighting Bavmorda.

805
01:20:10,994 --> 01:20:12,951
现在你和那个侏儒还想把那孩子送去吗?
Now you and this peck
are gonna take her on?

806
01:20:14,122 --> 01:20:16,826
默得马迪根你总和我说你不为任何你效力
You always told me you served
no one, Madmartigan.

807
01:20:16,958 --> 01:20:18,915
你什么时候成为十字军战士的?
Since when are you a crusader?

808
01:20:21,213 --> 01:20:23,252
侏儒, 他会帮助你的
He's not gonna help you, peck.

809
01:20:24,549 --> 01:20:26,790
他是个很值钱的盗贼
He's a worthless thief.

810
01:20:27,928 --> 01:20:30,335
埃尔克我不是贼
I'm not a thief, Airk.

811
01:20:30,472 --> 01:20:32,049
他不是贼
He's not a thief.

812
01:20:34,643 --> 01:20:35,674
你不是吗?
Are you?

813
01:20:50,284 --> 01:20:52,656
我为奈尔人效力
I serve the Nelwyn, Airk.

814
01:20:58,792 --> 01:21:01,365
- 想和我们一起去吗?
- 你不会成功的
- Want to come with us?
- You'll never make it.

815
01:21:03,381 --> 01:21:05,706
那我们就再说一次再见吧
Then once again
we say goodbye.

816
01:21:19,105 --> 01:21:22,473
- 在这边!
- 索尔沙!
- Over here!
- Sorsha!

817
01:21:22,608 --> 01:21:24,849
放下武器, 要不就杀了她!
Weapons down or she's dead!

818
01:21:39,458 --> 01:21:41,415
上马!
追他们!
Get to your horses!
After them!

819
01:22:27,631 --> 01:22:30,086
这边!
走这边!
This way!
This way!

820
01:22:30,218 --> 01:22:32,887
沿着乌鸦飞的方向!
As the crow flies, you fools!

821
01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:42,596
- 你勒得我太紧了!
- 我不希望你跑掉
- You're holding me too tight!
- I don't want you to get away.

822
01:22:42,730 --> 01:22:46,774
为什么? 因为你是我得太阳
你是我的月亮, 你是我的星空?
Why? Because I'm your sun,
your moon, your starlit sky?

823
01:22:49,153 --> 01:22:51,192
你的头发离我的脸远点, 要不我救剪掉它
Get your hair out of my face
or I'll chop it off.

824
01:22:55,242 --> 01:22:56,949
我真的--
Did I really--

825
01:22:57,077 --> 01:22:59,116
我昨晚真的说那些话了吗?
Did I really say
those things last night?

826
01:22:59,247 --> 01:23:02,331
- 在你的帐篷?
- 你说你爱我
- In your tent?
- You said you loved me.

827
01:23:02,459 --> 01:23:04,914
- 我不记得了
- 你撒谎!
- I don't remember that.
- You lied to me!

828
01:23:05,044 --> 01:23:06,206
不是, 我--
No, I--

829
01:23:07,505 --> 01:23:09,877
昨晚的我不是我自己
I just wasn't myself last night.

830
01:23:10,007 --> 01:23:13,624
我想我的力量使你陶醉
你对它束手无策
I suppose my power enchanted you
and you were helpless against it.

831
01:23:14,971 --> 01:23:17,129
- 只是一部分
- 然后呢?
- Sort of.
- Then what?

832
01:23:18,308 --> 01:23:21,593
- 不记得了
- 不记得了?
- It went away.
- Went away?

833
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:24,645
"没有你我将在黑暗中生活,"
这也不记得了?
"I dwell in darkness without you,"
and it went away?

834
01:23:24,772 --> 01:23:26,479
不记得了
Yeah.

835
01:23:48,088 --> 01:23:49,914
快! 凯尔来了!
Hurry! Kael's coming!

836
01:23:54,510 --> 01:23:56,751
默得马迪根, 快点!
Madmartigan, come on! Now!

837
01:24:04,813 --> 01:24:06,604
默得马迪根, 快走啦!
Madmartigan, come on!

838
01:24:08,483 --> 01:24:11,234
他们追来了! 快走!
They're coming! Away!

839
01:24:11,361 --> 01:24:12,523
走吧!
Go on!

840
01:24:30,672 --> 01:24:32,214
吁! 吁!
Whoa! Whoa!

841
01:24:33,842 --> 01:24:35,336
这边!
This way!

842
01:24:41,517 --> 01:24:45,300
特尔阿斯伦!
终于到了特尔阿斯伦!
Tir Asleen!
At last, Tir Asleen!

843
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:57,568
有人吗?
Hello?

844
01:24:59,535 --> 01:25:01,077
有人吗?
Hello?

845
01:25:05,248 --> 01:25:06,623
有没有人?
Hello?

846
01:25:08,544 --> 01:25:11,165
侏儒, 真不知道为什么会相信你?
Why did I listen to you, peck?

847
01:25:11,297 --> 01:25:14,748
"我们到了特尔阿斯伦一切都会好的"
"Everything will be all right
once we get to Tir Asleen."

848
01:25:15,676 --> 01:25:18,510
这里唯一的一直军队就是正在穿越村庄...
The only army around is the one that's
about to ride across this valley...

849
01:25:18,637 --> 01:25:20,463
准备杀我们的那些人!
and wipe us out!

850
01:25:20,597 --> 01:25:23,597
但是车林德瑞亚说我们在这里会很安全的
But Cherlindrea said
we'd be safe here.

851
01:25:24,393 --> 01:25:27,429
安全? 看看这些人
Safe? Look at these people.

852
01:25:27,563 --> 01:25:31,430
侏儒, 这里被诅咒了
睁眼看看, 这里战败了!
This place is cursed, peck.
It's falling apart. Open your eyes!

853
01:25:31,567 --> 01:25:32,895
而且--
And it--

854
01:25:35,278 --> 01:25:37,270
洞穴巨人
Trolls.

855
01:25:40,326 --> 01:25:42,365
我讨厌洞穴巨人
I hate trolls.

856
01:25:43,162 --> 01:25:45,534
这就是巴夫莫达的作品
This is the work of Bavmorda.

857
01:25:54,757 --> 01:25:57,294
威洛? 那个魔杖
Willow? The wand.

858
01:25:57,426 --> 01:26:00,759
- 把我变回人形
- 你确信?
- Turn me back into my human form.
- Are you sure?

859
01:26:19,032 --> 01:26:20,146
好极了
Good.

860
01:26:27,748 --> 01:26:29,787
快, 威洛
把我变回去
Hurry, Willow.
Transform me.

861
01:26:29,917 --> 01:26:32,834
我不会
我不是个法师
I can't do it.
I'm just not a sorcerer.

862
01:26:32,963 --> 01:26:38,798
但是你能行
一个字一个字的念
But you can be.
Speak and be one with the words.

863
01:26:38,927 --> 01:26:42,046
Avalorium greenan... (咒语)
Avalorium greenan...

865
01:26:45,599 --> 01:26:48,303
哦, 威洛, 你又弄错了
Oh, Willow, you're losing me.

866
01:26:52,607 --> 01:26:54,848
默得马迪根, 凯尔来了!
Madmartigan, Kael's coming!

867
01:26:54,984 --> 01:26:59,277
- 威洛, 你这个笨蛋
- 罗洁爱尔?
- Willow, you idiot.
- Raziel?

868
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:02,729
上面有弩炮
Arm that catapult up there.

869
01:27:24,389 --> 01:27:28,089
干得好, 默得马迪根
Good work, Madmartigan.

870
01:27:28,226 --> 01:27:29,885
你怎么这副样子了?
What happened to you?

871
01:27:30,019 --> 01:27:32,592
攻击!
索尔沙, 尽全力给我打!
Assault!
Sorsha, battering ram!

872
01:27:37,819 --> 01:27:39,277
把它砍下来!
Cut it down!

873
01:27:51,333 --> 01:27:52,328
快!
Faster!

874
01:28:07,891 --> 01:28:10,179
前进! 撞破它!
Forward! Break it down!

875
01:28:30,789 --> 01:28:33,279
再来! 再来!
Again! Again!

876
01:28:37,963 --> 01:28:40,370
威洛, 对着那个洞穴人用魔杖
Willow, use the wand
on that troll.

877
01:28:42,677 --> 01:28:44,052
Bellalockt! (咒语)
Bellalockt!

878
01:29:07,242 --> 01:29:10,693
撞破它! 快!
Break it down! Forward!

879
01:29:57,919 --> 01:30:00,291
抓住他!
Get him!

891
01:34:37,241 --> 01:34:39,566

威洛!
Willow!

894
01:35:03,810 --> 01:35:05,767
- 埃洛拉被带走了
- 威洛
- Elora's gone.
- Willow.

895
01:35:06,938 --> 01:35:09,938
他们带走了她
他们人太多了
They've taken her.
There were too many of them.

896
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:17,237
你还能骑马吗?
Can you ride?

897
01:35:20,493 --> 01:35:21,951
我们走
Let's ride.

898
01:35:34,424 --> 01:35:36,749
我找到了那孩子!
I have the child!

899
01:36:01,243 --> 01:36:03,318
我们需要塔楼和战梯!
We need towers
and a battering ram!

900
01:36:03,453 --> 01:36:06,537
把帐篷拆了!

傍晚的时候我们会攻城

903
01:36:24,475 --> 01:36:26,467
索尔沙在哪?
Where's Sorsha?

904
01:36:27,645 --> 01:36:30,431
殿下, 她背叛了我们
She has turned against us,
Your Highness.

905
01:36:34,568 --> 01:36:36,975
背叛我?
Turned against me?

906
01:36:40,616 --> 01:36:42,691
去准备祭奠吧!
Prepare for the ritual!

907
01:37:06,309 --> 01:37:08,597
这根本不是一个正规军
This is not an army.

908
01:37:11,856 --> 01:37:14,477
快, 藏起来
Quick. Hide.

909
01:37:19,321 --> 01:37:22,357
快念咒语保护自己
Use the shelter chant.

910
01:37:22,492 --> 01:37:24,449
- 为什么?
-  快做吧
- Why?
-Just do it.

911
01:37:30,082 --> 01:37:34,542
- 我们是为埃洛拉・达南而战的
- 你敢向我挑战?
- We've come for Elora Danan.
- You dare to challenge me?

912
01:37:34,671 --> 01:37:36,912
你们连正规军都不是
You're not warriors.

913
01:37:38,591 --> 01:37:39,919
你们这些猪!
