1
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:46,213
Okay, see you tomorrow.

2
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:19,130
From Independence Mall,
this is news radio, KYW Philadelphia ten...

3
00:05:40,755 --> 00:05:44,172
Absolute chaotic scene
behind me right now at this intersection,

4
00:05:44,255 --> 00:05:45,505
where just earlier this evening

5
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,838
a bus driver collided
with several oncoming vehicles,

6
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:51,505
- one of them a cement mixer.
- All right, here we go.

7
00:05:51,588 --> 00:05:53,797
A huge mess on the scene here right now.

8
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,338
We're still not clear
as to what exactly happened here,

9
00:05:57,422 --> 00:06:01,380
whether the driver passed out
while operating the vehicle

10
00:06:01,463 --> 00:06:03,172
or simply died at the wheel.

11
00:06:04,005 --> 00:06:06,172
We don't have a cause of death
at this point,

12
00:06:06,255 --> 00:06:08,630
but some of our medical experts
are talking about the fact

13
00:06:08,713 --> 00:06:10,172
that it could've been a heart attack

14
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:11,797
- or a stroke.
- Mmm, perfect pancake!

15
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,963
We don't have a name on the driver,
no information at all.

16
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:16,807
Police have not released that
at this point.

17
00:06:16,838 --> 00:06:19,088
Next of kin still being notified.

18
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:21,047
But no other casualties reported,

19
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,814
- which is a minor miracle.
- Fuck.

20
00:06:22,838 --> 00:06:25,213
Speaking with some of the officers
here on the scene...

21
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:26,297
Fuck.

22
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:28,630
Shit.

23
00:06:29,547 --> 00:06:32,047
- Shit.
- There could have been more fatalities

24
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,005
is what these officers are saying to me.
Uh, we...

25
00:06:35,088 --> 00:06:37,255
You burned 'em again,
didn't you?

26
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:39,380
No! No, no, nothing's burnt.

27
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:43,088
Ah, come on.

28
00:06:48,505 --> 00:06:49,838
Yes, I'll be right out.

29
00:06:52,297 --> 00:06:53,797
Ah, Jesus.

30
00:06:56,963 --> 00:06:58,422
Hey, hey, baby.

31
00:07:00,172 --> 00:07:01,255
- Hmm.
- Hey.

32
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:03,838
Was that Maddox?

33
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,588
Yeah. I gotta go soon.

34
00:07:06,588 --> 00:07:08,172
I feel like a piñata.

35
00:07:08,255 --> 00:07:09,713
How's my baby girl?

36
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:11,255
Kicking up a storm.

37
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:13,547
Feels like she got your big feet.

38
00:07:13,797 --> 00:07:15,797
Maybe I'll pick up some Doc Martens
on the way out.

39
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:18,213
Come on up.

40
00:07:21,255 --> 00:07:22,255
- Here.
- Ah.

41
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:25,380
Had that weird pregnancy dream again.

42
00:07:25,463 --> 00:07:26,463
Oh, no.

43
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,130
We were still on the beach,
but a little different this time.

44
00:07:31,547 --> 00:07:34,213
I couldn't see you,
but I knew you were with me,

45
00:07:34,297 --> 00:07:37,838
like how sometimes you just know
things like that in a dream.

46
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:40,005
Honey, you seen my other shoe?

47
00:07:40,422 --> 00:07:41,880
Your shoes are under the bed.

48
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:43,338
Go on, I'm listening.

49
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,922
So we were standing
in the shallow water,

50
00:07:46,005 --> 00:07:49,005
and we were playing that game
like you play as a kid.

51
00:07:49,922 --> 00:07:52,047
When the tide would go back out

52
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,922
you'd twist a little and...

53
00:07:54,838 --> 00:07:57,505
and sink lower
into the wet sand.

54
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,588
I just kept sinking down and down,

55
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:03,547
and no matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't get up.

56
00:08:06,963 --> 00:08:08,380
- Tommy?
- What?

57
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:12,213
You make the worst pancakes.

58
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,338
I've gotta go, okay?

59
00:08:17,922 --> 00:08:19,713
I love you, Tommy Lockhart.

60
00:08:19,922 --> 00:08:20,922
I love you more.

61
00:08:21,172 --> 00:08:23,797
But these graveyard shifts are the worst.

62
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,797
I'm tired of having breakfast for dinner.

63
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,380
And they're almost over, okay?

64
00:08:29,463 --> 00:08:31,963
- Detective's around the corner.
- Mm-hmm.

65
00:08:32,297 --> 00:08:34,422
But I'll bring you something back
to make up for it.

66
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:36,922
Oh, promises promises.

67
00:08:38,338 --> 00:08:39,755
So, I pinky swear.

68
00:08:41,547 --> 00:08:44,005
- I look forward to being proven wrong.
- Deal.

69
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,755
With the shot clock winding
down, Barkley coming up short once again.

70
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:52,797
Another good night of rebounding
for Charles, but not enough buckets.

71
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,963
Come on, Barkley.

72
00:08:56,297 --> 00:08:57,838
Shit.

73
00:08:59,213 --> 00:09:00,213
About time.

74
00:09:00,797 --> 00:09:01,672
Yeah.

75
00:09:01,755 --> 00:09:03,922
Now the Sixers playoff...

76
00:09:04,338 --> 00:09:06,922
Hey, come on, I wanna see how it ends.

77
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:10,213
Huh, Winston Maddox, you got some amount
of money riding on this tonight?

78
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:11,130
Shit.

79
00:09:11,213 --> 00:09:12,380
- Yeah?
- Don't do it.

80
00:09:15,797 --> 00:09:17,637
And that's all she wrote, folks.

81
00:09:17,713 --> 00:09:21,463
Philadelphia loses a heartbreaker
to Atlanta, 103 to 101.

82
00:09:22,338 --> 00:09:23,463
Well, there you go.

83
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:25,547
Thanks for that.

84
00:09:25,588 --> 00:09:26,588
How much?

85
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,731
Thought most folks think about
moving out of white trash neighborhoods.

86
00:09:36,755 --> 00:09:38,755
Yeah, yeah. Trust me, I'm working on it.

87
00:09:39,588 --> 00:09:42,880
You know, the first perp that ever took
a swing at me was two blocks that way.

88
00:09:42,963 --> 00:09:44,963
Oh, yeah. You never mentioned it.

89
00:09:46,047 --> 00:09:49,255
Yeah, you're all jokes now, but you've got
a pregnant wife back there, pal.

90
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,547
Trust me, I know.

91
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,505
Back pain,
feet the size of a kitchen sink.

92
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:55,338
She's cranky, she's hungry...

93
00:09:55,422 --> 00:09:56,588
Yeah, I remember those days.

94
00:09:56,672 --> 00:09:59,255
But hey, maybe you can find the guy
that knocked her up

95
00:09:59,338 --> 00:10:01,422
- and make him deal with it.
- Fuck you.

96
00:10:02,797 --> 00:10:03,922
All right, what do we got?

97
00:10:04,005 --> 00:10:06,255
We've got a big pile-up downtown.

98
00:10:06,338 --> 00:10:07,338
The city bus?

99
00:10:07,713 --> 00:10:11,130
That's bridge traffic.
That's gonna be, I don't know, 30 minutes?

100
00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:13,213
Ten spot says I'll get us there in 20.

101
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,380
I'll take that.

102
00:10:47,505 --> 00:10:49,005
Oh, 22 minutes. You owe me ten.

103
00:10:49,588 --> 00:10:50,797
Shit.

104
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,963
I want a recount.

105
00:10:57,755 --> 00:10:59,130
Oh, fuck. Holt's here.

106
00:10:59,755 --> 00:11:02,213
You know, when he, uh,
dry cleans his ties, it's full starch.

107
00:11:02,297 --> 00:11:03,130
What a dick.

108
00:11:03,213 --> 00:11:06,047
- Hey, that's my wife's brother.
- Tell me he's not a dick.

109
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,380
- Maintain a safe distance at all times.
- Keep it clear over there!

110
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,880
This whole thing is nuts.
You should've seen the bus driver.

111
00:11:13,963 --> 00:11:16,005
- You would have loved it.
- Yeah? Why?

112
00:11:16,088 --> 00:11:17,755
Oh, trust me, she's a doozy.

113
00:11:19,005 --> 00:11:20,088
No, man, don't do it.

114
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:24,088
- Don't do it. You know how Holt gets.
- I'll just take a peek.

115
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,963
Is a normal, boring shift too much to ask?

116
00:11:43,547 --> 00:11:44,987
Blood's not from her injury.

117
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,463
You got some gloves?

118
00:11:47,547 --> 00:11:48,922
You got a detective badge?

119
00:11:50,463 --> 00:11:51,630
I'll bum you a smoke.

120
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,047
Oh, God, do you smell that?

121
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:01,630
Severe hemorrhage...

122
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,047
then hit hard on the steering wheel.

123
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,588
Yeah, but why the hemorrhage?

124
00:12:13,088 --> 00:12:14,588
What the fuck?

125
00:12:14,922 --> 00:12:15,922
Empty.

126
00:12:17,963 --> 00:12:19,588
Whoa, don't touch that.

127
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,380
Pieces of brain.

128
00:12:25,463 --> 00:12:26,922
Goddamn.

129
00:12:27,838 --> 00:12:29,630
Who invited you two to the party?

130
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:33,755
Officers, I'm gonna need you to dust
all this broken glass for fingerprints.

131
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,505
I'm just fucking with you.

132
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,255
Yeah.

133
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,297
So how's my sis? She about to explode?

134
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,880
Yeah, any day. Uh, you know, these are...

135
00:12:45,963 --> 00:12:47,130
Chunks of brain.

136
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:49,505
Yep, we solved that one, Crockett.

137
00:12:58,588 --> 00:12:59,755
Yeah? What about that?

138
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:02,880
Uh, birthmark.

139
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:04,047
Maybe a rash.

140
00:13:05,922 --> 00:13:07,380
Looks like a puncture wound.

141
00:13:08,463 --> 00:13:09,588
Sure, sharp glass.

142
00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:12,797
Boys across town
just caught two more bodies.

143
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,088
Bled out: ears, nose, mouth.

144
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,505
They said both had some kind of mark
on their neck.

145
00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:20,338
A whole lot of birthmarks.

146
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,148
Pump your brakes, all right?
You've had your five minutes.

147
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:24,172
Come on.

148
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,630
Nah.

149
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:31,047
We're not gonna go.

150
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:33,422
We're gonna stay here. We'll relax.

151
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:35,338
Find our center.

152
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,463
Practice our breathing.

153
00:13:38,547 --> 00:13:41,922
Plenty of people can stand behind tape,
yell at reporters. Come on.

154
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,088
I'll drive!

155
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,255
Come on.

156
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:06,005
Shit.

157
00:14:07,463 --> 00:14:08,963
You guys going on tour?

158
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,213
Hey, just trying to learn
from the best, Detective.

159
00:14:13,588 --> 00:14:14,588
Okay.

160
00:14:15,297 --> 00:14:17,505
- Go ahead.
- Well, there was just blood everywhere.

161
00:14:28,297 --> 00:14:29,797
But no brains on this one.

162
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:40,713
Oh! There we go.

163
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,630
Ah, Jesus!

164
00:14:43,755 --> 00:14:46,338
No kind of hemorrhage I know of
includes brain disintegration.

165
00:14:46,422 --> 00:14:49,797
It could be a drug thing,
you know, puncture wounds.

166
00:14:50,338 --> 00:14:53,130
- What we need to do is run toxicology.
- What do you mean, "we"?

167
00:14:53,213 --> 00:14:55,422
Look, you were right
about the bus driver, good call,

168
00:14:55,505 --> 00:14:58,213
but I'm running point on this.
You do your job, I'll do mine.

169
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,814
- Come on, give me a bone here.
- Detective! Detective Holt!

170
00:15:00,838 --> 00:15:03,172
Look, look, look,
I respect the hustle, I do,

171
00:15:03,255 --> 00:15:04,255
- but...
- Detective!

172
00:15:04,755 --> 00:15:08,588
Look, even though nobody said the word
"serial killer" out loud yet,

173
00:15:08,672 --> 00:15:10,672
that time's coming, and when it does...

174
00:15:11,422 --> 00:15:13,630
this is my first big one, okay.

175
00:15:14,088 --> 00:15:15,172
This could make me.

176
00:15:15,755 --> 00:15:17,880
I need to be able
to wrap my head around it on my own.

177
00:15:17,963 --> 00:15:20,588
Just give me a little breathing room,
all right?

178
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:22,963
- All right.
- Detective!

179
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,755
Detective, what can you tell us
about the other two victims?

180
00:15:25,838 --> 00:15:28,088
Sorry, everybody,
no official statement yet.

181
00:15:28,172 --> 00:15:30,255
You know the drill,
we're still collecting evidence.

182
00:15:30,338 --> 00:15:32,218
Is there a connection
to the other deaths?

183
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:34,815
- What'd I tell you? He's a dick.
- I can't answer that question,

184
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,588
and even if I could,
I wouldn't do it right here, okay?

185
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:55,555
Eh, you're just making
more work for yourself,

186
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:58,130
and more importantly, more work for me.

187
00:15:58,213 --> 00:16:00,088
You don't want to see
where this goes? Huh?

188
00:16:01,172 --> 00:16:04,338
Shit. I wanna go kick bums
out of the park like we're supposed to.

189
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,088
Yeah, well, bums will still be there
when we're done, bud.

190
00:16:07,755 --> 00:16:09,130
Hey, you Dr. Hanson?

191
00:16:09,213 --> 00:16:10,047
Yeah.

192
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,213
Yeah, three bodies came in tonight,
all of them had brain hemorrhaging,

193
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:14,963
marks in the back of their neck.

194
00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:15,880
And who are you?

195
00:16:15,963 --> 00:16:18,338
Oh, I'm, uh, Officer Lockhart.
This is Officer Maddox.

196
00:16:18,422 --> 00:16:20,922
Okay. Well, there's been a hold
placed on that report

197
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:22,797
by detective Brian Holt.

198
00:16:23,005 --> 00:16:23,838
Surprise.

199
00:16:23,922 --> 00:16:26,755
- Yeah, he's family, sir. I'm sure...
- I said a hold, Officer.

200
00:16:26,838 --> 00:16:30,088
Can't break protocol every time
some idiot's stuck with a needle.

201
00:16:31,422 --> 00:16:32,588
So it was a puncture wound.

202
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,713
Injection sites.

203
00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:41,172
And deep enough to impact the vertebrate.

204
00:16:41,547 --> 00:16:44,922
So, some kind of poison,
like blowfish toxin?

205
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,463
No. An unstable isotope.

206
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:49,505
Some shit.

207
00:16:49,672 --> 00:16:51,630
Lab techs all have hard-ons for it.

208
00:16:52,005 --> 00:16:53,005
Why?

209
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,047
Because we have no idea what it is.

210
00:16:56,838 --> 00:16:58,297
No one's ever seen it before.

211
00:16:58,922 --> 00:17:00,338
Now, if you'll excuse me...

212
00:17:01,213 --> 00:17:02,963
I've got other dead people waitin'.

213
00:17:06,463 --> 00:17:08,183
All right, we need to think.

214
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:12,088
Hoagies.

215
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:13,463
Last night.

216
00:17:13,797 --> 00:17:15,088
- Pizza.
- Too greasy.

217
00:17:15,922 --> 00:17:17,213
Oriental it is.

218
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:19,672
You know, I think
you're supposed to say "Asian" now.

219
00:17:19,755 --> 00:17:22,505
Whatever, as long as they keep
that sweet and sour pork coming,

220
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:24,463
I'll call 'em whatever they want. Shit.

221
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,255
Listen, all I'm saying is
we got people getting injected

222
00:17:29,338 --> 00:17:32,505
with a fucking isotope of all things,
and nobody can tell us shit.

223
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:35,388
And the times of death are minutes apart,
the bodies are miles apart...

224
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:36,255
How does that work?

225
00:17:36,338 --> 00:17:38,880
I'll take "crazy shit happens"
for 200, Alex.

226
00:17:38,963 --> 00:17:41,689
We had three random victims
with the brains melted out of their faces.

227
00:17:41,713 --> 00:17:43,047
That means nothing to you?

228
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:45,755
I'll admit, it's weird, but... shit.

229
00:17:46,505 --> 00:17:49,588
Remember them two yuppies washed up
on the shore of the lake couple years ago?

230
00:17:49,672 --> 00:17:52,547
Buck naked, bruised up.
Everybody thought it was a mob hit.

231
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,422
Turns out it was just two gays,
liked it rough,

232
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:57,981
having a bit too much to drink
before they went skinny dipping.

233
00:17:58,005 --> 00:17:59,685
But you heard
what the coroner said, right?

234
00:17:59,713 --> 00:18:02,088
Man, your energy's
all over the place, man.

235
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,213
Let the game come to you.

236
00:18:05,297 --> 00:18:06,797
Says the grand master.

237
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:08,338
Everything else aside,

238
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,338
I say this from experience,

239
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:12,630
once that kiddo arrives...

240
00:18:13,713 --> 00:18:15,047
that'll be the whole boat.

241
00:18:16,213 --> 00:18:19,088
You won't have time
to think about shit this much. It'll be...

242
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:20,922
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- ...background noise.

243
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,255
- I hope.
- Give me that ten bucks.

244
00:18:23,338 --> 00:18:24,338
Mmm.

245
00:18:24,797 --> 00:18:26,380
Say what now?

246
00:18:26,463 --> 00:18:29,103
It's not my fault you've got
a gambling problem. Give me the money.

247
00:18:29,838 --> 00:18:30,963
Thank you. Hold that.

248
00:18:31,672 --> 00:18:33,672
Hey, I'll strike you a deal here.

249
00:18:33,755 --> 00:18:35,588
Uh, give me that... that for ten?

250
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:38,963
Yeah.

251
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:43,755
Thank you.

252
00:18:44,297 --> 00:18:45,505
Gonna make a girl happy.

253
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:47,047
Appreciate it.

254
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,422
Oh.

255
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:54,213
Oh, come on, I was gonna eat that.

256
00:18:54,463 --> 00:18:55,463
You're kidding me.

257
00:18:55,713 --> 00:18:56,713
Put it on my tab.

258
00:18:57,047 --> 00:18:58,047
What tab?

259
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:02,588
Units be advised 314
at Hydra on 22nd and Armory,

260
00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:04,588
female, late teens, assaulted,

261
00:19:04,672 --> 00:19:05,922
blunt force to the neck.

262
00:19:07,505 --> 00:19:09,297
Uh, dispatch, this is car 39.

263
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,922
Could you get the officer at Hydra
and get me on the radio?

264
00:19:15,297 --> 00:19:18,672
- Go for it, Officer Palmer.
- Evening. Officer Lockhart here.

265
00:19:18,755 --> 00:19:21,130
You mind looking at the back
of your victim's neck?

266
00:19:22,672 --> 00:19:23,672
All right.

267
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:25,297
See anything?

268
00:19:27,422 --> 00:19:30,047
Yeah, three bumps.
Little circles.

269
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,380
What about the blood?

270
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:33,588
Anything weird?

271
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:36,588
What blood? She's still alive.

272
00:19:36,963 --> 00:19:39,005
All right, we're on our way.

273
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,518
Girl says she was stabbed
with some kind of metal tool or some shit.

274
00:20:17,547 --> 00:20:18,380
Metal tool?

275
00:20:18,463 --> 00:20:20,588
Last week we had a guy come in
from this place,

276
00:20:20,672 --> 00:20:22,838
egg beater stuck up his ass,
I shit you not.

277
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,255
I was too impressed to be disgusted.

278
00:20:34,338 --> 00:20:35,547
All right, let's see it.

279
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:43,297
All right, tell me what happened.

280
00:20:45,338 --> 00:20:46,463
She had on a blue hoodie.

281
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:48,213
"She"?

282
00:20:48,505 --> 00:20:50,005
Honey, you sure she's a "she"?

283
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,422
Yes, yeah.

284
00:20:53,047 --> 00:20:54,672
- Yes.
- What'd she look like?

285
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,797
Like she was in the wrong neighborhood.

286
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,380
Black.

287
00:21:02,713 --> 00:21:04,005
All right, anything else?

288
00:21:06,255 --> 00:21:07,380
Yeah, um...

289
00:21:07,963 --> 00:21:10,505
Her hand was all messed up.
It was covered in dried blood.

290
00:21:11,172 --> 00:21:12,172
Okay, which hand?

291
00:21:12,963 --> 00:21:13,963
I...

292
00:21:15,047 --> 00:21:16,922
Okay, it's okay. Which hand? Right here.

293
00:21:17,005 --> 00:21:18,005
Um...

294
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,130
- Her left. Left.
- Left hand.

295
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:21,523
- Yeah.
- Okay, you're doing great.

296
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:24,588
Tom, I just got off with the coroner.
What the hell?

297
00:21:24,672 --> 00:21:26,547
Yeah, I was just about to get you
on the radio.

298
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,172
Just please step outside.

299
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,273
Listen, she's got that shit
in her bloodstream. We need to...

300
00:21:31,297 --> 00:21:32,463
Step aside.

301
00:21:32,547 --> 00:21:33,755
What do you mean, "shit"?

302
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,570
Don't even listen to him. It's fine.

303
00:21:36,005 --> 00:21:37,005
Okay.

304
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:39,588
From the top. What happened?

305
00:21:40,255 --> 00:21:41,695
Come on, I just told him everything.

306
00:21:41,755 --> 00:21:44,172
He's a little deaf. I want you to tell me.

307
00:21:46,422 --> 00:21:47,963
I was just dancing, okay,

308
00:21:48,047 --> 00:21:50,547
and out of nowhere,
this crazy chick tackles me to the ground.

309
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,963
She was real strong, too.

310
00:21:52,172 --> 00:21:54,630
These guys, they...
they pulled her off me, but...

311
00:21:55,505 --> 00:21:58,505
she... she poked my neck with something.

312
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,880
Miss?

313
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,755
Jesus. Hey, hey, hey!

314
00:22:04,838 --> 00:22:05,880
I need some help here!

315
00:22:05,963 --> 00:22:06,797
Whoa, whoa!

316
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,713
I need an EMT!

317
00:22:07,797 --> 00:22:09,630
We need an EMT now! Hey! Now, now, now!

318
00:22:09,713 --> 00:22:12,047
Get a medic up here! Get a medic up here!
Hey, hey, hey!

319
00:22:13,672 --> 00:22:16,172
Stand by for a single live BOLO.

320
00:22:16,713 --> 00:22:18,172
Suspect is a black female,

321
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:20,380
last seen at Hydra on Arch Street.

322
00:22:20,463 --> 00:22:21,963
Five foot six, twenties,

323
00:22:22,172 --> 00:22:23,672
dried blood on her left hand,

324
00:22:23,755 --> 00:22:25,672
wearing a blue-hooded sweatshirt.

325
00:23:12,963 --> 00:23:13,963
Freeze!

326
00:23:14,338 --> 00:23:15,458
Put your hands on your head!

327
00:23:30,005 --> 00:23:31,088
All units be advised:

328
00:23:32,088 --> 00:23:34,380
suspect last seen on foot
at Chestnut and University.

329
00:23:35,005 --> 00:23:37,338
Repeat, Chestnut and University.

330
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,338
This is our chance at detective.

331
00:23:45,547 --> 00:23:47,422
Don't tell me
you're not thinking about it.

332
00:23:47,755 --> 00:23:49,838
I'm thinking I got
the wrong skin tone for that.

333
00:23:49,922 --> 00:23:52,297
But you got that sparkling personality.

334
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,880
Shit.

335
00:23:57,297 --> 00:23:58,963
Hey, move it!

336
00:24:00,713 --> 00:24:01,630
Get out of the way.

337
00:24:01,713 --> 00:24:03,463
Move along, people.

338
00:24:07,755 --> 00:24:10,255
- Mm-mm-mm.
- Hey. Right there.

339
00:24:12,672 --> 00:24:14,312
- Right there.
- Whoa, look, man.

340
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,856
You about to draw down on Old Saint Nick.
You almost killed Christmas.

341
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,130
Whoa!

342
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:24,630
- Hey!
- Holy shit.

343
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:31,380
Whoa!

344
00:24:31,463 --> 00:24:33,755
What are you doing, man?

345
00:24:34,213 --> 00:24:35,297
Come on!

346
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,380
Goddamn.

347
00:24:37,588 --> 00:24:38,838
Come on.

348
00:24:39,963 --> 00:24:41,255
Ah!

349
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:44,088
Suspect heading west across Liberty!

350
00:24:46,172 --> 00:24:50,463
I repeat, suspect heading west
across Liberty!

351
00:24:51,047 --> 00:24:53,463
If you've got a badge on your chest
and a gun on your hip,

352
00:24:53,547 --> 00:24:55,630
I want you at that position now.

353
00:25:01,463 --> 00:25:03,047
- Whoa, whoa!
- Goddamn!

354
00:25:03,547 --> 00:25:05,172
No, no, no!

355
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:06,630
Goddamn! Goddamn!

356
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:07,713
Goddamn!

357
00:25:09,005 --> 00:25:10,172
Whoa!

358
00:25:10,505 --> 00:25:11,797
I got kids, man.

359
00:25:13,588 --> 00:25:14,922
Truck! Truck!

360
00:25:16,963 --> 00:25:18,047
Whoa!

361
00:25:22,422 --> 00:25:23,797
Go around! Go around!

362
00:25:24,922 --> 00:25:26,922
Police! Move! Go! Get out of the way!

363
00:25:31,338 --> 00:25:32,422
Move!

364
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,505
Out of the way! Go! Move!

365
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:45,130
- Lock, she went this way!
- Hey!

366
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:47,755
Move!

367
00:25:54,047 --> 00:25:56,338
I got this! I got this!
Go around! Go around!

368
00:26:16,797 --> 00:26:18,463
I gotta cut back to a pack a day.

369
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:21,713
What do you got?

370
00:26:26,213 --> 00:26:27,255
I got eyes on her!

371
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,130
All right.

372
00:26:40,297 --> 00:26:41,963
Meet me at Girard subway station.

373
00:26:42,255 --> 00:26:43,297
Block all the exits.

374
00:26:43,797 --> 00:26:45,630
What the fuck
are you talking about?

375
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,380
I'm flushing her out.

376
00:26:48,463 --> 00:26:49,463
Shit!

377
00:26:58,838 --> 00:27:00,380
You two, on the door!

378
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,963
No one in and no one out!

379
00:27:02,047 --> 00:27:03,255
You two, come with me.

380
00:27:08,797 --> 00:27:09,797
Out of the way!

381
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,172
Philly PD, get the fuck out of here!

382
00:27:17,713 --> 00:27:19,297
What the hell?

383
00:27:33,963 --> 00:27:34,963
Come on.

384
00:27:39,088 --> 00:27:42,005
Officer Lockhart,
I've got Rosewood General on the line.

385
00:27:42,088 --> 00:27:43,588
Your wife's going into labor.

386
00:27:43,672 --> 00:27:45,088
She's being taken there now.

387
00:27:45,505 --> 00:27:47,172
Officer Lockhart, please respond.

388
00:27:48,422 --> 00:27:49,838
You two, stay on this level.

389
00:28:27,547 --> 00:28:28,547
Lock?

390
00:28:30,047 --> 00:28:31,047
I got her.

391
00:28:38,255 --> 00:28:39,755
I'm a police officer.

392
00:28:41,338 --> 00:28:42,797
We've got the exits sealed.

393
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,463
Why don't you come on out?

394
00:28:46,672 --> 00:28:47,755
Put your hands up.

395
00:29:03,713 --> 00:29:04,547
Lock!

396
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,463
Hey! Hey!

397
00:29:13,547 --> 00:29:14,630
Maddox!

398
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,547
Maddox! Maddox!

399
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,922
Hey, what happened?

400
00:29:24,297 --> 00:29:25,922
Got the wind knocked out of me.

401
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,005
Go. Go!

402
00:29:28,088 --> 00:29:29,088
Lock!

403
00:29:31,422 --> 00:29:33,922
Fuck! I think she broke my leg.

404
00:29:34,255 --> 00:29:35,588
Goddammit.

405
00:29:37,338 --> 00:29:39,422
Officer down. Officer down.

406
00:29:39,672 --> 00:29:42,047
I need an ambulance
at the Girard Street subway.

407
00:29:46,255 --> 00:29:47,838
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

408
00:29:47,922 --> 00:29:50,130
Stay right there.
Stay right fucking there!

409
00:29:51,463 --> 00:29:52,505
Put your hands up.

410
00:29:52,838 --> 00:29:53,672
Now!

411
00:29:53,755 --> 00:29:55,005
Put your hands up.

412
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:58,630
Get on the ground.

413
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,672
Get on the ground. Hey, hey!

414
00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:03,172
You fucking deaf?
I said get on the ground.

415
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,172
Hello, Thomas.

416
00:30:08,547 --> 00:30:09,963
This is where it happens.

417
00:30:11,213 --> 00:30:12,213
What?

418
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:15,213
What'd you say?

419
00:30:16,797 --> 00:30:18,672
Congratulations on your daughter.

420
00:30:20,713 --> 00:30:21,797
Shut the fuck up.

421
00:30:22,713 --> 00:30:24,047
I said get on the ground!

422
00:30:27,797 --> 00:30:29,130
I want you to know...

423
00:30:31,213 --> 00:30:33,172
I'm sorry about your partner.

424
00:30:37,297 --> 00:30:38,463
I never meant to...

425
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:40,880
Fuckin' stop talking.

426
00:31:12,172 --> 00:31:13,297
I'll see you soon.

427
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:22,130
No! No!

428
00:32:14,672 --> 00:32:16,005
Step back, guys.

429
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:31,713
Whoa, pal!
Hey, what are you still doing here?

430
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,130
Did nobody tell you?

431
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,047
Excuse me.

432
00:32:48,255 --> 00:32:49,255
Officer Lockhart?

433
00:32:49,297 --> 00:32:51,130
Yes, sir. Uh, where's the maternity ward?

434
00:32:51,213 --> 00:32:54,130
Uh, next building, down the hallway,
elevator to the third floor.

435
00:32:54,213 --> 00:32:56,653
I know it's not the best time,
but I need to check a few boxes

436
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:57,880
while it's still fresh.

437
00:32:57,963 --> 00:32:59,005
Lockhart. Lockhart!

438
00:33:03,963 --> 00:33:05,797
Okay, so far, she's a nobody,

439
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,297
no ID, no fingerprint matches, nothing.

440
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,755
All she had on her were these keys.
We have no idea what they go to.

441
00:33:11,838 --> 00:33:13,558
We're drawing a blank.
Mean anything to you?

442
00:33:13,588 --> 00:33:15,463
- No.
- I'll need to see your revolver.

443
00:33:15,547 --> 00:33:16,630
- What?
- Your revolver!

444
00:33:17,922 --> 00:33:18,922
Here.

445
00:33:19,922 --> 00:33:20,922
Jeanette Lockhart?

446
00:33:21,047 --> 00:33:23,967
- Lockhart. Just give me one moment.
- You didn't fire your weapon at all?

447
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:26,797
- No.
- Well, somebody did.

448
00:33:28,255 --> 00:33:30,297
They pulled a bullet
from our girl's wrist...

449
00:33:30,713 --> 00:33:32,338
and it matches a service revolver.

450
00:33:32,422 --> 00:33:35,255
- What are you talking about?
- No one else reported a shot fired.

451
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:37,422
We can't make heads or tails.

452
00:33:37,963 --> 00:33:38,963
So...

453
00:33:39,297 --> 00:33:41,547
what happened down there, son,
in the subway station?

454
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,963
Are you Jeanette's husband?

455
00:33:44,047 --> 00:33:46,088
Yes, yes. Hi, I'm... I'm Tom...
Tom Lockhart.

456
00:33:46,172 --> 00:33:48,005
There's been a complication.

457
00:33:48,547 --> 00:33:49,713
Placental abruption.

458
00:33:49,797 --> 00:33:50,713
What?

459
00:33:50,797 --> 00:33:51,797
She's hemorrhaging.

460
00:33:52,213 --> 00:33:54,297
But so far,
the baby appears to be safe.

461
00:33:56,713 --> 00:33:59,213
Push!

462
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:01,797
Keep going! Keep going!

463
00:34:03,963 --> 00:34:05,172
Come on, Jeanie!

464
00:34:06,505 --> 00:34:08,088
Hey, I'm right here.

465
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,547
I'm right here. I'm right here, baby.

466
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
You're doing great.

467
00:34:11,922 --> 00:34:13,630
It's okay. Yeah.

468
00:34:13,713 --> 00:34:16,148
It's okay. Look, I got you something.

469
00:34:16,172 --> 00:34:18,630
I got you something good.
Yeah, I got you a bracelet.

470
00:34:18,713 --> 00:34:21,672
We're gonna push right through this.
We're gonna push right through this.

471
00:34:22,922 --> 00:34:26,047
- Okay. Come on, Jeanie, one more push.
- You're almost there, Mrs. Lockhart.

472
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,047
Come on.

473
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,422
The next one, big push, okay, Jeanie?
Jeanie?

474
00:34:29,505 --> 00:34:31,172
- Honey, come on.
- Jeanie?

475
00:34:31,713 --> 00:34:34,130
- What are her vitals?
- Baby? Honey?!

476
00:34:35,713 --> 00:34:37,513
- Get out of the room!
- Honey, honey!

477
00:34:37,588 --> 00:34:38,422
Hey!

478
00:34:38,505 --> 00:34:39,505
I got CPR!

479
00:35:27,588 --> 00:35:28,588
It's okay.

480
00:35:28,922 --> 00:35:31,047
It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.

481
00:36:35,422 --> 00:36:37,963
I'm here on location in Center City

482
00:36:38,047 --> 00:36:41,213
on the nine-year anniversary
of the Market Street murders.

483
00:36:41,297 --> 00:36:44,213
As you can see,
protesters have gathered here once again.

484
00:36:44,297 --> 00:36:46,130
They're calling for a new investigation

485
00:36:46,213 --> 00:36:50,547
into the death of a still unidentified
African-American suspect.

486
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:54,130
Those gathered here believe
the Philadelphia police are to blame.

487
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:56,463
Black so-called perpetrator.

488
00:36:56,755 --> 00:36:58,047
We got a white cop,

489
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,213
and based on his own admission,

490
00:37:00,297 --> 00:37:01,630
the woman was unarmed.

491
00:37:02,172 --> 00:37:04,088
Yet, he could not bring her in

492
00:37:04,172 --> 00:37:06,130
without throwing her in front of a train?

493
00:37:06,213 --> 00:37:08,713
They never identified the woman's body,

494
00:37:08,797 --> 00:37:12,172
and they never released a motive
for the homicide.

495
00:37:12,255 --> 00:37:15,630
And the icing on the cake
is the man got a promotion.

496
00:37:15,713 --> 00:37:16,838
A promotion?

497
00:37:16,922 --> 00:37:18,797
But Mayor Ed Rendell disagrees.

498
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,380
Whereas there's an unfortunate
divide in our community today,

499
00:37:22,463 --> 00:37:24,922
we also have to remember the victims
and their families.

500
00:37:25,505 --> 00:37:27,130
Because there are no easy answers here,

501
00:37:27,213 --> 00:37:29,963
just as there weren't
on that night nine years ago.

502
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:31,963
- Daddy?
- In terms of the traffic...

503
00:37:32,047 --> 00:37:32,880
Yeah?

504
00:37:32,963 --> 00:37:33,963
What's that, baby?

505
00:37:34,547 --> 00:37:36,005
Your breakfast is melting.

506
00:37:38,755 --> 00:37:41,797
I thought we agreed
on no more ice cream for breakfast.

507
00:37:43,547 --> 00:37:44,838
Even on birthdays?

508
00:37:49,297 --> 00:37:52,380
You got me, honey. Why don't you put mine
in the fridge? Uh...

509
00:37:53,088 --> 00:37:54,255
I'm gonna be right out.

510
00:37:59,547 --> 00:38:02,213
Happy birthday, kiddo.

511
00:38:05,922 --> 00:38:06,922
Which hand?

512
00:38:07,713 --> 00:38:10,005
- That one!
- I don't know. Are you sure?

513
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:11,088
Yeah.

514
00:38:15,797 --> 00:38:16,797
Put it on.

515
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:20,963
Wow, we got so many places here.

516
00:38:21,047 --> 00:38:23,088
We've got this one, we've got that one.

517
00:38:23,172 --> 00:38:24,338
There we go.

518
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,838
- Well, what do you think?
- Well...

519
00:38:30,255 --> 00:38:32,963
- it's not as good as last year's.
- Oh.

520
00:38:34,005 --> 00:38:35,213
But...

521
00:38:35,297 --> 00:38:36,380
I'll take it.

522
00:38:41,922 --> 00:38:42,922
What?

523
00:38:45,255 --> 00:38:46,255
Nothing.

524
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,505
Happy birthday, honey.

525
00:38:49,297 --> 00:38:50,338
How's Maddox?

526
00:38:50,797 --> 00:38:51,797
Old...

527
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,380
and hungry.

528
00:38:54,172 --> 00:38:55,505
Bears love bunnies.

529
00:38:56,463 --> 00:38:57,963
Dad, we need to hurry up.

530
00:38:58,422 --> 00:39:00,380
I wanna get there right when it opens.

531
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,255
Honey, the bears
are gonna be there all day.

532
00:39:02,338 --> 00:39:04,880
Yeah, but brown bears are diurnal.

533
00:39:04,963 --> 00:39:07,203
So we have a better chance
of seeing them in the morning.

534
00:39:07,255 --> 00:39:08,255
Oh.

535
00:39:09,463 --> 00:39:11,922
Well, you know we gotta
do something first though, right?

536
00:39:12,963 --> 00:39:13,963
Mommy?

537
00:39:14,588 --> 00:39:15,672
That's right, Mommy.

538
00:39:17,463 --> 00:39:18,463
Eat up.

539
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:35,338
And these.

540
00:39:35,588 --> 00:39:36,713
And some of these.

541
00:39:36,797 --> 00:39:38,380
These are good.

542
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,130
And...

543
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,255
Whatever one you want.
Or do you want pink?

544
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:45,338
Maybe, yeah.

545
00:39:54,255 --> 00:39:55,588
Why are they so angry?

546
00:39:56,255 --> 00:39:59,005
Don't worry about them.
They're just celebrating your birthday.

547
00:39:59,547 --> 00:40:01,172
But they sound mad.

548
00:40:01,463 --> 00:40:04,463
Well, you know, some people
aren't happy unless they're mad.

549
00:40:05,297 --> 00:40:07,422
You'll see what I mean when you get older.

550
00:40:15,255 --> 00:40:16,255
Daddy?

551
00:40:18,922 --> 00:40:19,922
Daddy?

552
00:40:25,463 --> 00:40:26,505
Daddy, what's wrong?

553
00:40:27,422 --> 00:40:28,422
Nothing.

554
00:40:30,005 --> 00:40:31,005
Nothing's wrong.

555
00:40:40,588 --> 00:40:42,755
Megan's dad makes his own schedule.

556
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:44,338
Megan's dad ain't a detective.

557
00:40:44,422 --> 00:40:45,588
He's a doctor.

558
00:40:46,297 --> 00:40:48,588
So, we both save lives.

559
00:40:50,713 --> 00:40:52,130
It's true. Hey.

560
00:40:54,588 --> 00:40:56,505
Detective Lockhart, yes, hello.

561
00:40:57,172 --> 00:40:58,755
Slow down. Slow...

562
00:40:59,922 --> 00:41:01,922
What do you mean it's happening again?

563
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:06,338
Yeah.

564
00:41:07,297 --> 00:41:08,463
Yeah, I'll be right there.

565
00:41:22,338 --> 00:41:23,338
Sit right here.

566
00:41:25,797 --> 00:41:27,422
See the body yet? Back of the neck?

567
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,255
Good morning to you, too.
Somebody get a badge for their birthday?

568
00:41:31,338 --> 00:41:32,797
I got the call just now.

569
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,755
- She's eight.
- Nine.

570
00:41:36,213 --> 00:41:38,505
All right. Happy birthday, kiddo.

571
00:41:39,338 --> 00:41:40,463
Thank you, Maddox.

572
00:41:40,838 --> 00:41:42,297
It's fine. Don't worry, okay?

573
00:41:42,672 --> 00:41:43,672
Hey...

574
00:41:44,172 --> 00:41:46,047
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

575
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:49,672
No frowning.
We're still going to the zoo, baby.

576
00:41:50,005 --> 00:41:51,172
Give me a pinky swear.

577
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,422
I don't do pinky swears.

578
00:42:00,338 --> 00:42:01,338
Yates!

579
00:42:01,547 --> 00:42:03,713
Do me a solid.
Look after Amy for a second.

580
00:42:03,797 --> 00:42:05,588
- Uh...
- I appreciate it. Go.

581
00:42:06,005 --> 00:42:07,005
Hey, stay with her.

582
00:42:07,422 --> 00:42:09,838
- Have they been here all day?
- All day.

583
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:16,713
I don't think it's a good habit
to start bringing her to work every day.

584
00:42:16,797 --> 00:42:17,672
It's one time.

585
00:42:17,755 --> 00:42:18,755
It's a crime scene.

586
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:22,297
Yeah, calm down. She's in the car.
I won't have her inspecting the corpse.

587
00:42:24,172 --> 00:42:26,630
You didn't, uh,
put flowers on her grave, did you?

588
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,380
Say what now?

589
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:31,505
Jeanie. There were fresh flowers
on the grave this morning.

590
00:42:31,588 --> 00:42:32,630
No card, no note.

591
00:42:33,505 --> 00:42:34,505
No.

592
00:42:35,588 --> 00:42:36,588
All right.

593
00:43:01,755 --> 00:43:03,005
Nine years, huh?

594
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,505
Political copycats?

595
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,255
Where would they get the poison?

596
00:43:15,672 --> 00:43:17,755
Labbies could never reverse-engineer this.

597
00:43:21,172 --> 00:43:23,088
Well, well well, now it's a party.

598
00:43:23,172 --> 00:43:24,755
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.

599
00:43:27,088 --> 00:43:28,713
How's the birthday girl?

600
00:43:29,588 --> 00:43:31,297
Ooh, she's a whole year older.

601
00:43:34,297 --> 00:43:35,297
Hey, uh...

602
00:43:36,422 --> 00:43:39,088
You didn't go by Jeanie's grave, did you?

603
00:43:40,422 --> 00:43:42,297
Uh... not yet. Why?

604
00:43:43,588 --> 00:43:44,588
Josiah Warren.

605
00:43:46,672 --> 00:43:48,380
- Who's that?
- Rings a bell. Uh...

606
00:43:48,463 --> 00:43:51,505
It's an anarchist.
One of those Ruby Ridge types.

607
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:56,005
Look at us, right back in it, all this
Market Street shit all over again.

608
00:43:56,797 --> 00:43:58,130
Lieutenant Holt?

609
00:43:59,547 --> 00:44:00,755
You guys gotta see this.

610
00:44:02,422 --> 00:44:05,588
- Hey, man, I'll take it from here.
- All right, let's see it. What do you got?

611
00:44:20,463 --> 00:44:21,588
Shit.

612
00:44:22,463 --> 00:44:23,672
Damn good copycat.

613
00:44:23,755 --> 00:44:26,755
We let these insane protesters
take it up a notch every year.

614
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:29,255
- This is what we get.
- Well, up a notch to murder.

615
00:44:29,338 --> 00:44:32,963
It only takes one deranged enough
to dress like her and kill like her.

616
00:44:33,047 --> 00:44:35,047
- Really?
- If it's not one of them, who is it?

617
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,050
I mean, come on,
you're the brilliant detectives.

618
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:38,505
You got any ideas?

619
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:43,630
- None of it makes any sense.
- Has anybody else seen this?

620
00:44:44,088 --> 00:44:47,005
- Not so far in security.
- Good, let's keep it that way.

621
00:44:47,088 --> 00:44:48,880
No news, no talking to reporters.

622
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:52,130
Protesters are just looking
for a reason to riot.

623
00:44:52,213 --> 00:44:53,838
That's not your call, Detective.

624
00:45:41,422 --> 00:45:42,422
Lock?

625
00:45:46,297 --> 00:45:47,297
You good, man?

626
00:45:51,338 --> 00:45:52,463
Nine years, huh?

627
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:57,755
You know, there was something
I never told you about that night,

628
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:58,838
down in the subway.

629
00:46:00,963 --> 00:46:02,172
She told me things.

630
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,213
She knew about Amy.

631
00:46:05,797 --> 00:46:07,713
Things she shouldn't
have been able to know.

632
00:46:08,588 --> 00:46:09,963
What are you talking about?

633
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:12,588
She said we'd see each other again.

634
00:46:14,755 --> 00:46:16,838
After she died, there were no more bodies.

635
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:18,797
We stopped looking.

636
00:46:19,297 --> 00:46:21,797
We never put together
any of the pieces because, hey,

637
00:46:22,255 --> 00:46:23,588
case closed, right?

638
00:46:23,672 --> 00:46:26,088
Well, yeah. I mean, shit.

639
00:46:29,047 --> 00:46:31,547
I think it's time we put together
some of the pieces.

640
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:37,005
Hey, hey, find out anything you can
about these keys.

641
00:46:37,088 --> 00:46:38,380
- Eighty-eight?
- Yeah.

642
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:39,463
You got it.

643
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:42,172
- Your dad putting you to work, Amy?
- She's got a point.

644
00:46:42,255 --> 00:46:43,255
Breaking news.

645
00:46:43,338 --> 00:46:46,178
We are going to go live with a briefing
about the Market Street murders.

646
00:46:46,213 --> 00:46:47,088
Uncle Brian!

647
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:49,572
We have reason to believe
she's still currently in the city.

648
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:50,630
No, don't show her.

649
00:46:50,672 --> 00:46:53,505
- Our suspect is wanted in connection...
- Don't... don't show her.

650
00:46:53,588 --> 00:46:55,713
with the Market Street murders of 1988.

651
00:46:55,797 --> 00:46:57,088
Damn it! Motherfucker!

652
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:58,463
Language.

653
00:46:58,547 --> 00:47:01,606
- Yeah, he's your uncle. Great job.
- It is believed she may be connected to...

654
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:04,838
at least two homicides
in the last 24 hours.

655
00:47:06,088 --> 00:47:08,005
She is priority number one

656
00:47:08,338 --> 00:47:11,297
for all law enforcement agencies
in Philadelphia.

657
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,380
- Get me, uh...
- Philly PD tip line....

658
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:15,783
At the present moment,
she is considered to be armed

659
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:16,963
and extremely dangerous.

660
00:47:17,047 --> 00:47:19,130
Yes, we are aware
the killer is a woman.

661
00:47:19,213 --> 00:47:22,463
Now to the good people
of Philadelphia, let me assure you...

662
00:47:22,922 --> 00:47:24,172
that apprehending this woman...

663
00:47:25,797 --> 00:47:28,922
...is our department's
primary objective.

664
00:47:29,588 --> 00:47:30,922
But we need your help.

665
00:47:32,338 --> 00:47:35,838
If you or anyone you know
has any information on his woman...

666
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,630
or if you've seen anyone
who matches her description...

667
00:47:40,338 --> 00:47:41,755
do not engage,

668
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,338
but call our tip line.

669
00:47:45,797 --> 00:47:48,005
Officers are standing by to hear you.

670
00:47:49,338 --> 00:47:50,588
Working together,

671
00:47:51,088 --> 00:47:52,922
we can apprehend a vicious criminal.

672
00:47:54,713 --> 00:47:55,713
Thank you.

673
00:47:56,297 --> 00:47:57,713
And stay safe, Philadelphia.

674
00:47:58,547 --> 00:48:00,067
- Questions?
- Lieutenant Holt...

675
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:14,564
We couldn't find anything these fuckers
had in common when there was four of 'em.

676
00:48:14,588 --> 00:48:16,255
Adding folks doesn't make it any easier.

677
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,880
Yeah.

678
00:48:19,547 --> 00:48:21,297
These two were both left-handed.

679
00:48:23,713 --> 00:48:26,172
These two both voted for Perot.

680
00:48:26,422 --> 00:48:27,422
Shit.

681
00:48:29,755 --> 00:48:32,172
These two have nothing in common,

682
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,630
except for the fact
that both their blood is red.

683
00:48:34,713 --> 00:48:36,630
No. It's her hand.

684
00:48:39,088 --> 00:48:40,088
It's her hand.

685
00:48:40,922 --> 00:48:41,922
What about it?

686
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:45,922
We never told anybody
about her hand injury.

687
00:48:46,005 --> 00:48:47,838
We didn't release that to the press.

688
00:48:49,047 --> 00:48:51,463
How in the hell a copycat
gonna know that detail?

689
00:48:54,547 --> 00:48:56,005
It's nine years ago, brother.

690
00:48:56,338 --> 00:48:57,338
Shit gets leaked.

691
00:49:00,255 --> 00:49:02,047
What, you think she didn't actually die?

692
00:49:04,172 --> 00:49:05,422
Is that what you're saying?

693
00:49:08,213 --> 00:49:10,213
Please tell me
that's not what you're saying.

694
00:49:11,755 --> 00:49:13,422
Key is to a Falcon 160.

695
00:49:13,755 --> 00:49:15,213
Fairly common on small airfields.

696
00:49:15,297 --> 00:49:17,963
Unfortunately, there's no way
to match up the key

697
00:49:18,047 --> 00:49:19,422
to a specific plane.

698
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:20,838
Now, hold on now.

699
00:49:21,213 --> 00:49:25,297
It says that this plane
was manufactured in 1996.

700
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:27,380
Yeah, the model came out last year.

701
00:49:28,213 --> 00:49:29,213
Last year?

702
00:49:29,755 --> 00:49:32,088
How in the hell
did she have these keys in '88?

703
00:49:33,797 --> 00:49:34,797
Prototype.

704
00:49:35,755 --> 00:49:36,963
Eight years before?

705
00:49:38,088 --> 00:49:41,713
I made some calls. A hundred-mile radius,
there's only one airfield with this model.

706
00:49:46,755 --> 00:49:47,755
Yo, man.

707
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:55,547
Uh, hey, why don't you do me a favor
and look after her until I'm back, okay?

708
00:49:59,047 --> 00:50:01,213
Hey, hey, hey.

709
00:50:01,297 --> 00:50:02,297
How you doing?

710
00:50:02,713 --> 00:50:03,713
Hey.

711
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:06,172
I've gotta work
a little bit longer, all right?

712
00:50:06,505 --> 00:50:09,880
But Miss Tabitha right there, she's gonna
look after you till I get back.

713
00:50:09,963 --> 00:50:10,963
Okay?

714
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:12,422
It's dark.

715
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,422
The zoo's closed.

716
00:50:14,755 --> 00:50:15,797
Baby, I know.

717
00:50:16,672 --> 00:50:19,152
I'm gonna make it up to you tomorrow
when we go in the morning,

718
00:50:19,213 --> 00:50:21,297
'cause that's when
they're gonna be out, right?

719
00:50:21,547 --> 00:50:22,963
They're diurnal, remember?

720
00:50:24,088 --> 00:50:25,088
Mmm.

721
00:50:27,255 --> 00:50:28,255
I'll see you later.

722
00:50:29,422 --> 00:50:30,422
Let's go.

723
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:35,547
I almost forgot. A Dr. Naveen Rao called
for you three times on the tip line.

724
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,310
They wanna talk to me, they gotta come in.

725
00:50:37,338 --> 00:50:38,630
Yeah, that's what I told him.

726
00:50:38,713 --> 00:50:39,922
Detective Lockhart, excuse me.

727
00:50:40,713 --> 00:50:43,005
Detective Lockhart,
I've been waiting for over an hour.

728
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,797
Hi, my name is Naveen Rao.
I'm a senior physicist at...

729
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,172
- You have from here to the door.
- I know you've got a lot on your plate.

730
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,935
I know what I'm going to say
will sound more like fiction than fact.

731
00:50:52,963 --> 00:50:54,797
The door is pretty close, by the way.

732
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,088
I believe your case intersects
with my work in a significant way.

733
00:50:58,172 --> 00:51:01,630
Both appearances of the murderer have
happened during a specific lunar perigee.

734
00:51:01,713 --> 00:51:03,297
In this case, nine years apart.

735
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,630
What you may know
simply as a super moon or a blood moon

736
00:51:05,713 --> 00:51:08,005
are actually events
of great scientific significance.

737
00:51:08,088 --> 00:51:08,922
Fascinating.

738
00:51:09,005 --> 00:51:11,064
When the lunar cycle
reaches exactly the right point,

739
00:51:11,088 --> 00:51:14,588
its gravitational forces react
with electromagnetic pockets and...

740
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:16,213
Hey, whoa!

741
00:51:16,963 --> 00:51:20,005
...theoretically creates a kind of bridge.

742
00:51:22,463 --> 00:51:23,963
Yeah, bridge to where?

743
00:51:24,505 --> 00:51:26,130
Another place entirely.

744
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,172
My advice:

745
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,755
take it to Channel Five.

746
00:51:34,338 --> 00:51:35,672
They'll eat this shit up.

747
00:52:25,963 --> 00:52:28,088
Well, it's locked.

748
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:31,005
Time to call it a night. Let's go home.

749
00:52:34,838 --> 00:52:36,797
Oh, you see that? Someone's here.

750
00:52:38,463 --> 00:52:39,505
We gotta go in.

751
00:52:41,297 --> 00:52:42,797
Don't do this, man, not like this.

752
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,047
Hey, you got a better idea, I'm all ears.

753
00:52:47,213 --> 00:52:48,297
You've got that look.

754
00:52:49,088 --> 00:52:51,588
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know.

755
00:52:51,672 --> 00:52:52,672
No, I don't know.

756
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:55,850
Don't use this
as some kind of fucked-up way

757
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:57,922
of dealing with what happened
to Jeanie.

758
00:53:01,088 --> 00:53:02,088
Lock.

759
00:53:02,297 --> 00:53:03,588
Leave it alone.

760
00:53:03,672 --> 00:53:04,672
Don't...

761
00:53:06,922 --> 00:53:07,922
Lock.

762
00:53:11,255 --> 00:53:12,255
Lock!

763
00:53:21,422 --> 00:53:22,505
Hey, how'd you get in here?

764
00:53:22,588 --> 00:53:25,297
Hey. Detective Lockhart. Uh, Philly PD.

765
00:53:27,297 --> 00:53:28,297
You, uh...

766
00:53:30,755 --> 00:53:31,963
seen this woman?

767
00:53:33,088 --> 00:53:34,213
Can't say that I have.

768
00:53:43,422 --> 00:53:45,297
- Everything all right tonight?
- Yeah.

769
00:53:46,005 --> 00:53:47,463
Yeah, everything's fine. Why?

770
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:52,130
No, just...

771
00:53:53,005 --> 00:53:54,297
you're here kind of late.

772
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:55,380
Yeah, I had a...

773
00:53:55,755 --> 00:53:57,088
I had a guy call in and cancel.

774
00:53:57,172 --> 00:53:59,463
But, you know,
still gotta do the paperwork, right?

775
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:02,213
Never enough paperwork.

776
00:54:02,922 --> 00:54:04,713
No. No, there never is.

777
00:54:06,672 --> 00:54:07,672
Ah...

778
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:11,630
Well, okay.

779
00:54:12,672 --> 00:54:13,672
Ah...

780
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,338
Well, you know, let me give you my number.

781
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,005
In case anything...

782
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:22,172
you know, comes to mind.

783
00:54:31,463 --> 00:54:32,588
Yeah.

784
00:54:32,672 --> 00:54:33,922
Thanks. Yeah.

785
00:54:34,005 --> 00:54:35,797
Thanks. Maybe I will.

786
00:54:37,963 --> 00:54:40,005
All right. Oh, uh, you know,
before I forget...

787
00:54:41,088 --> 00:54:41,963
uh,

788
00:54:42,047 --> 00:54:44,963
what's the best way to get back
to the turnpike from here?

789
00:54:46,255 --> 00:54:47,588
Could you draw me a map?

790
00:54:50,005 --> 00:54:51,005
Sure.

791
00:54:55,088 --> 00:54:56,297
It's, uh...

792
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:00,588
It's that way.

793
00:55:02,047 --> 00:55:03,047
Appreciate that.

794
00:55:09,297 --> 00:55:10,297
Hey, Tom.

795
00:55:13,047 --> 00:55:14,255
Nice to see you again.

796
00:55:15,505 --> 00:55:17,130
Holy shit, it is you.

797
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:18,213
Gun on the floor.

798
00:55:18,713 --> 00:55:19,713
Yeah.

799
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:26,982
If you were a better shot, I'd be dead.

800
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:30,422
Now, sit down.

801
00:55:31,088 --> 00:55:32,255
- Sit!
- Yeah.

802
00:55:36,588 --> 00:55:37,713
Tape his wrists.

803
00:55:38,172 --> 00:55:40,172
- Tape his wrists!
- Okay, okay.

804
00:55:40,255 --> 00:55:41,838
- Let's go! Move it!
- Easy.

805
00:55:44,505 --> 00:55:46,630
Just stay calm. Relax.

806
00:55:50,838 --> 00:55:52,422
- Faster.
- I'm trying.

807
00:55:58,797 --> 00:55:59,797
Lock.

808
00:56:00,422 --> 00:56:02,255
Hello? Hello?

809
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:05,463
- Okay.
- You.

810
00:56:05,922 --> 00:56:07,588
Get me the key to that plane outside.

811
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,963
- Okay.
- Move!

812
00:56:10,755 --> 00:56:11,922
I saw you die.

813
00:56:13,005 --> 00:56:14,338
Yeah, you did.

814
00:56:16,922 --> 00:56:18,505
- Here it is.
- Toss me the keys.

815
00:56:18,588 --> 00:56:21,088
Yeah. It's one... it's one lock 206.

816
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:33,255
Stay down! You too!

817
00:56:33,338 --> 00:56:34,422
All right, all right.

818
00:56:34,505 --> 00:56:36,213
Shit.

819
00:56:44,672 --> 00:56:46,047
Now you're coming with me.

820
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:50,145
- Yeah, yeah.
- Nose on the floor!

821
00:56:54,088 --> 00:56:55,005
Move it!

822
00:56:55,088 --> 00:56:56,547
I'm running out of time!

823
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:57,630
Freeze, bitch!

824
00:57:04,047 --> 00:57:05,547
- No.
- Maddox?

825
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:27,630
Lock?

826
00:57:27,713 --> 00:57:28,838
Hey! Don't shoot!

827
00:57:29,588 --> 00:57:31,005
Don't shoot! Nobody shoot!

828
00:57:31,422 --> 00:57:32,422
Don't risk it!

829
00:57:34,255 --> 00:57:36,380
Somebody give me
some fuckin' bolt cutters!

830
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:38,963
Fuck me.

831
00:58:24,922 --> 00:58:25,922
Tom?

832
00:58:26,588 --> 00:58:27,588
Thomas?

833
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:29,255
Hey.

834
00:58:31,172 --> 00:58:32,172
Listen.

835
00:58:33,422 --> 00:58:35,130
You have to stop chasing me.

836
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:37,755
I'm doing all this for a reason.

837
00:58:38,838 --> 00:58:40,380
I'm saving people's lives.

838
00:58:43,505 --> 00:58:44,713
You murdered my partner.

839
00:58:44,797 --> 00:58:46,588
That was never part of the plan.

840
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:52,463
How the hell are you alive?

841
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:56,422
Every nine years...

842
00:58:57,463 --> 00:58:58,797
when the moon sets,

843
00:58:59,255 --> 00:59:00,255
I can come back.

844
00:59:00,797 --> 00:59:01,880
But not for long.

845
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,380
The moon?

846
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:08,338
What do you mean come back? Huh?

847
00:59:08,422 --> 00:59:11,505
The more I tell you,
the more you'll keep coming after me.

848
00:59:11,797 --> 00:59:13,963
And I've seen how that turns out for you.

849
00:59:15,755 --> 00:59:17,547
You can choose to stop.

850
00:59:18,172 --> 00:59:19,297
Go home to your daughter.

851
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:22,505
Pretend none of this ever happened.

852
00:59:23,713 --> 00:59:25,005
Yeah, can't do that.

853
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,130
Hey.

854
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:30,380
- I don't have any more time.
- What are you doing? Whoa!

855
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:39,255
What the fuck were you thinking?

856
01:01:41,755 --> 01:01:44,338
There's a dozen different ways
you could have died.

857
01:01:46,255 --> 01:01:47,755
Goddammit.

858
01:01:50,088 --> 01:01:51,088
Look...

859
01:01:53,047 --> 01:01:54,297
- Hey.
- I'm sorry...

860
01:01:55,255 --> 01:01:56,297
about Maddox.

861
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:57,588
Sir.

862
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:01,172
We'll continue searching the area,
but so far, there's still no sign of her.

863
01:02:01,922 --> 01:02:02,922
Well, keep looking.

864
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:07,047
You won't find anything.

865
01:02:09,588 --> 01:02:10,630
She's gone, Holt.

866
01:02:12,005 --> 01:02:13,213
Just like the last time.

867
01:02:15,588 --> 01:02:17,047
What's that supposed to mean?

868
01:02:19,088 --> 01:02:20,338
She's gone back.

869
01:02:23,213 --> 01:02:24,213
Where?

870
01:02:25,255 --> 01:02:26,255
The future.

871
01:02:28,922 --> 01:02:30,755
She's from the future.

872
01:02:46,838 --> 01:02:48,672
 Why does the sun 

873
01:02:49,963 --> 01:02:52,880
 Go on shining? 

874
01:02:54,338 --> 01:03:00,005
 Why does the sea rush to shore? 

875
01:03:01,797 --> 01:03:04,963
 Don't they know 

876
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:08,797
 It's the end of the world? 

877
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:15,297
 'Cause you don't love me any more 

878
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:22,672
 Why do the birds go on singing? 

879
01:03:29,922 --> 01:03:30,922
Oh, man.

880
01:03:32,172 --> 01:03:35,255
 Don't they know 

881
01:03:35,338 --> 01:03:38,672
 It's the end of the world? 

882
01:03:40,588 --> 01:03:42,255
Ah.

883
01:03:43,172 --> 01:03:44,505
Hello, Harold.

884
01:04:04,505 --> 01:04:06,731
Philadelphia,
their whole, white uniforms,

885
01:04:06,755 --> 01:04:08,981
Iverson going left to right,
looking to add to the lead.

886
01:04:09,005 --> 01:04:10,880
Oh! A wicked crossover by Allen.

887
01:04:10,963 --> 01:04:13,797
Spins into the paint,
hits it out to Chris Webber.

888
01:04:14,213 --> 01:04:16,672
C. Webb knocks down the J
with a right elbow.

889
01:04:17,005 --> 01:04:19,838
Natural speed now,
smooth and tight in the mid-range.

890
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:22,880
He and A.I. continue to build
a great chemistry together.

891
01:04:23,088 --> 01:04:26,297
Philadelphia leads by four, 37-33.

892
01:04:26,547 --> 01:04:27,630
Take a break here...

893
01:04:38,422 --> 01:04:39,505
Tomorrow, buddy.

894
01:04:42,755 --> 01:04:44,130
This time we're gonna get her.

895
01:04:45,588 --> 01:04:47,898
Mr. Lockhart,
in answer to your numerous inquiries,

896
01:04:47,922 --> 01:04:51,255
Dr. Rao has been working
in the private sector for the past decade.

897
01:04:51,338 --> 01:04:54,005
and he has had no recent contact
with this office.

898
01:04:54,338 --> 01:04:58,130
And even if he did, policy prevents me
from giving out information

899
01:04:58,213 --> 01:05:00,713
of any employee or previous...

900
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:04,838
Hang on.

901
01:06:06,297 --> 01:06:08,005
- What?
- Mrs. Nowak?

902
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:09,505
Yeah.

903
01:06:09,588 --> 01:06:12,005
Thomas Lockhart. I'm...
I'm a private investigator.

904
01:06:12,088 --> 01:06:15,338
Wonder if I could just ask you
a few questions about your husband.

905
01:06:16,838 --> 01:06:18,130
Harold's dead.

906
01:06:18,838 --> 01:06:20,797
I'm aware of that. Um...

907
01:06:21,297 --> 01:06:22,297
I'm...

908
01:06:22,547 --> 01:06:25,213
gathering information
on local drug overdose cases.

909
01:06:25,297 --> 01:06:27,297
Where were you 18 years ago?

910
01:06:29,672 --> 01:06:30,672
May I come in?

911
01:06:34,963 --> 01:06:36,547
Don't let the cat out.

912
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,755
I went away to see my sister
for a week or so.

913
01:06:53,213 --> 01:06:54,297
Came back...

914
01:06:55,005 --> 01:06:56,255
found Harold...

915
01:06:56,922 --> 01:06:58,047
on the floor.

916
01:06:58,963 --> 01:07:00,922
Cracked his head open
on the desk when he fell.

917
01:07:03,213 --> 01:07:04,338
Blood...

918
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:05,922
everywhere.

919
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,755
All turned black.

920
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:14,505
Still got one of them flags in here.

921
01:07:25,797 --> 01:07:28,297
Your husband, he, um... wrote these?

922
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:30,672
Those and a lot more.

923
01:07:31,338 --> 01:07:33,297
Sent them all over the country

924
01:07:33,672 --> 01:07:35,297
hidden in these books.

925
01:07:37,755 --> 01:07:41,088
Let people have some privacy
about their ideas.

926
01:07:43,088 --> 01:07:45,297
Had quite a following.

927
01:07:48,963 --> 01:07:51,172
The movement was his thing.

928
01:07:52,922 --> 01:07:53,922
Were you into it?

929
01:07:56,422 --> 01:07:58,880
I was young and he a good dope.

930
01:08:00,047 --> 01:08:01,963
But he took it pretty serious.

931
01:08:03,255 --> 01:08:04,255
How serious?

932
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,463
Enough to freak me out.

933
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:15,047
You don't know, um,
who he mailed all these to, do you?

934
01:08:19,422 --> 01:08:20,422
Give me a minute.

935
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:32,630
Who's the girl?

936
01:08:33,505 --> 01:08:35,047
Heather Russell, Harold's ex.

937
01:08:36,463 --> 01:08:38,380
You heard of drinking the Kool-Aid?

938
01:08:38,463 --> 01:08:40,463
She fuckin' made the Kool-Aid.

939
01:08:43,047 --> 01:08:45,130
So they were working on this together?

940
01:08:45,213 --> 01:08:47,588
Until they split, crazy bitch.

941
01:08:48,505 --> 01:08:49,625
You know where she's at now?

942
01:08:50,213 --> 01:08:53,463
You keep track of the people
that fucked your wife before you did?

943
01:08:57,505 --> 01:08:58,505
Here you go.

944
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:00,547
Mailing list.

945
01:09:03,713 --> 01:09:05,547
Seems pretty important to you.

946
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:10,880
Suppose it is.

947
01:09:11,797 --> 01:09:13,005
Then I'd say...

948
01:09:14,255 --> 01:09:16,547
I've been pretty generous with my time.

949
01:09:18,047 --> 01:09:20,255
Lots of other things
a girl could be doing.

950
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:23,380
Hmm.

951
01:09:25,588 --> 01:09:28,547
Well, what do you propose, Arleen?

952
01:09:30,713 --> 01:09:32,088
How much you got on you?

953
01:09:49,005 --> 01:09:50,547
Asherdowns.

954
01:09:56,422 --> 01:09:57,630
Asherdowns.

955
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:09,713
Holy shit.

956
01:10:16,588 --> 01:10:18,228
You've reached Captain Brian Holt.

957
01:10:18,255 --> 01:10:19,606
- Come on.
- Please leave a message.

958
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:21,797
I'll get back to you soon as possible.

959
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:22,963
Hey, it's me.

960
01:10:23,588 --> 01:10:24,713
We gotta meet tonight.

961
01:10:25,005 --> 01:10:26,213
Think I found something.

962
01:10:27,047 --> 01:10:28,380
Might be a big something.

963
01:10:29,172 --> 01:10:31,255
And if it's, uh, not too big of a...
of an ask,

964
01:10:31,338 --> 01:10:34,213
I need you to run a current address
on a Heather Russell.

965
01:10:35,172 --> 01:10:36,172
Call me.

966
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:37,380
Bye.

967
01:10:51,297 --> 01:10:52,297
Hey, kiddo!

968
01:10:55,797 --> 01:10:56,963
I'm sorry I'm late.

969
01:10:57,797 --> 01:10:58,963
Got caught up.

970
01:11:01,297 --> 01:11:03,672
That beard's ridiculous.
You look like a homeless person.

971
01:11:04,713 --> 01:11:06,297
And it's good to see you.

972
01:11:11,755 --> 01:11:12,880
Got time for a...

973
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:15,588
late lunch or dinner?

974
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:18,963
Can't. Aunt Maggie's taking me
to King of Prussia.

975
01:11:20,172 --> 01:11:22,380
I could've taken you
to King of Prussia, too, you know?

976
01:11:22,463 --> 01:11:25,005
It's a girl's thing we're doing.
Not really your scene.

977
01:11:25,088 --> 01:11:26,422
Oh, okay.

978
01:11:33,672 --> 01:11:34,672
How's school?

979
01:11:35,047 --> 01:11:37,887
Guidance counselor thinks I have
a good shot at the scholarship to Penn.

980
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:42,505
Thought you wanted to go out of state.

981
01:11:42,922 --> 01:11:44,838
George is gonna stay around here, so...

982
01:11:45,463 --> 01:11:47,297
- Oh, what, the football guy?
- Yep.

983
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:48,380
Ah.

984
01:11:48,755 --> 01:11:50,672
Right, you told me about him before.

985
01:11:51,463 --> 01:11:52,463
You've met him,

986
01:11:52,797 --> 01:11:53,880
like, twice.

987
01:11:56,463 --> 01:11:57,672
Yeah, nice guy.

988
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,880
How's staying with Holt working out?

989
01:12:04,297 --> 01:12:05,297
Good.

990
01:12:06,338 --> 01:12:07,755
Closer to school, so...

991
01:12:09,797 --> 01:12:10,713
Good, I'm glad.

992
01:12:10,797 --> 01:12:11,922
It's for the best.

993
01:12:12,005 --> 01:12:14,505
I mean, for now, you know, honey.
I mean, it's just temporary.

994
01:12:14,838 --> 01:12:16,880
I'll be back on track soon enough.

995
01:12:24,338 --> 01:12:25,797
Seriously, Dad, still?

996
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,880
Uh, you know, somebody's gotta find him.

997
01:12:30,547 --> 01:12:32,213
Yeah, I gotta work.

998
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,297
I'm close this time, Ames.

999
01:12:37,588 --> 01:12:38,588
Real close.

1000
01:12:40,463 --> 01:12:41,463
You'll see.

1001
01:12:49,255 --> 01:12:50,838
Ah, bada-bing, bada-boom!

1002
01:12:50,922 --> 01:12:51,922
Here we go.

1003
01:12:55,172 --> 01:12:57,672
Why do you still have a scanner?
You're not a cop anymore.

1004
01:12:59,338 --> 01:13:01,255
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.

1005
01:13:02,338 --> 01:13:03,838
Almost forgot the whole thing.

1006
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:05,880
Happy birthday, kiddo.

1007
01:13:15,672 --> 01:13:16,672
For your bracelet.

1008
01:13:22,213 --> 01:13:24,213
Dad, I haven't worn that thing in years.

1009
01:13:27,297 --> 01:13:28,297
Oh.

1010
01:13:32,547 --> 01:13:34,130
Well, I kept the receipt, so...

1011
01:13:35,922 --> 01:13:36,922
Thanks for trying.

1012
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:48,963
Look, Ames, I know how things have been.

1013
01:13:51,005 --> 01:13:52,005
I get it.

1014
01:13:53,797 --> 01:13:55,838
I'm not Mr. Ideal Dad or whatever.

1015
01:13:58,713 --> 01:14:00,755
But I'm gonna finish this thing soon.

1016
01:14:03,088 --> 01:14:06,213
I promise you,
and then we're gonna get back to normal.

1017
01:14:06,588 --> 01:14:08,588
Just me and you, just like old times.

1018
01:14:08,963 --> 01:14:11,047
Dad, that's not how things work.
You can't just...

1019
01:14:16,172 --> 01:14:17,422
You gotta let it go.

1020
01:14:20,672 --> 01:14:21,672
And seriously,

1021
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:22,880
lose the beard.

1022
01:14:23,838 --> 01:14:24,838
Right.

1023
01:14:25,172 --> 01:14:26,172
Hey...

1024
01:14:26,505 --> 01:14:27,588
Uncle Brian home?

1025
01:14:28,088 --> 01:14:29,088
Bye, Dad.

1026
01:14:29,463 --> 01:14:30,588
You have him call me!

1027
01:15:14,463 --> 01:15:15,463
Hey.

1028
01:15:21,172 --> 01:15:22,255
You got that address?

1029
01:15:22,422 --> 01:15:23,547
Heather Russell?

1030
01:15:25,922 --> 01:15:27,547
Yeah, that's why you're here, right?

1031
01:15:28,255 --> 01:15:30,338
Look, for Jane and for Amy's sake,

1032
01:15:30,422 --> 01:15:31,547
I've been patient.

1033
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:33,505
Hey, hey, we missed one of our victims.

1034
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:37,505
Harold Nowak.

1035
01:15:38,838 --> 01:15:40,880
Just outside our jurisdiction, so...

1036
01:15:41,297 --> 01:15:44,505
Local boys wrote it off as a drug overdose
so we never caught it.

1037
01:15:48,588 --> 01:15:49,672
How'd you get that?

1038
01:15:50,172 --> 01:15:51,297
He was a nut.

1039
01:15:52,255 --> 01:15:53,547
Had a fringe militia club.

1040
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:54,755
The Real American Movement.

1041
01:15:54,838 --> 01:15:57,005
Wanted to take the country back
for the true patriots.

1042
01:15:57,088 --> 01:15:59,922
You know, homemade fertilizer bombs.
You know the type.

1043
01:16:02,713 --> 01:16:04,005
And I got his mailing list.

1044
01:16:06,422 --> 01:16:08,880
Two of the four victims from '97
were on it.

1045
01:16:08,963 --> 01:16:11,422
All of 'em from '88,
that's the connection.

1046
01:16:12,338 --> 01:16:14,018
They're all part of this radical movement.

1047
01:16:14,088 --> 01:16:16,005
- Tom.
- They were up to something big.

1048
01:16:16,588 --> 01:16:18,838
And I'm thinking that isotope
that she injects them with

1049
01:16:18,922 --> 01:16:21,463
is some high-tech way
of killing people remotely.

1050
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,922
And it's triggered
from the future, maybe. I...

1051
01:16:24,005 --> 01:16:25,047
I don't know. I don't...

1052
01:16:25,130 --> 01:16:27,088
I don't entirely
have that pinned down yet.

1053
01:16:27,172 --> 01:16:29,505
- Tom...
- You remember Naveen Rao

1054
01:16:29,588 --> 01:16:31,548
and his theory
about the lunar cycle bridge thing?

1055
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:32,755
Jesus, Tom.

1056
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:34,588
Had to do with the moon.

1057
01:16:36,172 --> 01:16:37,172
You need help.

1058
01:16:42,088 --> 01:16:43,088
You don't get it.

1059
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:47,630
She gets torn apart by a train
and nine years later she's back,

1060
01:16:47,713 --> 01:16:48,880
alive and killing.

1061
01:16:53,797 --> 01:16:54,797
Listen.

1062
01:16:58,297 --> 01:16:59,672
We're all going forward.

1063
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:01,880
But her...

1064
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:03,505
She's going backward.

1065
01:17:04,088 --> 01:17:05,672
Decade by decade.

1066
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:07,838
So that shit in '97...

1067
01:17:08,547 --> 01:17:09,797
she didn't come back to life.

1068
01:17:11,755 --> 01:17:13,672
She just wasn't dead yet.

1069
01:17:13,755 --> 01:17:15,005
You sound insane.

1070
01:17:15,547 --> 01:17:19,338
Okay? You sound like a fuckin'
insane person right now. You need help.

1071
01:17:21,088 --> 01:17:22,755
She knew things about me, Holt.

1072
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:26,213
She knew things about Jeanie,

1073
01:17:26,588 --> 01:17:27,588
and Amy.

1074
01:17:28,422 --> 01:17:29,922
Things that she couldn't know.

1075
01:17:30,422 --> 01:17:31,963
And she killed Maddox.

1076
01:17:33,672 --> 01:17:35,130
She's coming back again...

1077
01:17:36,088 --> 01:17:37,088
and it's today.

1078
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:41,130
Do you...?

1079
01:17:42,338 --> 01:17:44,018
Have you completely lost
your fuckin' mind?

1080
01:17:44,088 --> 01:17:47,880
You're talking about a case...
that's been cold for a fuckin' decade.

1081
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:51,130
You know how many murders
I've had in the past week?

1082
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,213
I'm raising your own daughter,
for Christ sake,

1083
01:17:54,297 --> 01:17:57,047
and you're coming to me
with fucking time travel?

1084
01:18:00,422 --> 01:18:02,172
Are you even listening to yourself?

1085
01:18:08,463 --> 01:18:09,505
You're all I got.

1086
01:18:10,755 --> 01:18:12,755
I couldn't stop what happened to Jeanie.

1087
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:14,380
But I can stop her.

1088
01:18:15,463 --> 01:18:17,755
This is Harold Nowak's wife.

1089
01:18:18,672 --> 01:18:20,588
This is his muse.

1090
01:18:22,547 --> 01:18:24,255
All I want is her address.

1091
01:18:24,547 --> 01:18:27,047
And I won't ask you for nothing
ever again.

1092
01:18:27,922 --> 01:18:28,922
I promise.

1093
01:18:29,922 --> 01:18:30,922
Please.

1094
01:18:35,922 --> 01:18:38,588
You're chasing moonbeams
while your own life got away.

1095
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,755
It's just fucking sad to watch.

1096
01:18:42,838 --> 01:18:44,838
It's sad that Amy has to watch it.

1097
01:18:53,297 --> 01:18:54,297
Is it worth it?

1098
01:19:12,797 --> 01:19:13,797
Maybe you're right.

1099
01:19:17,505 --> 01:19:18,505
Maybe I...

1100
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:20,172
maybe I need help.

1101
01:19:25,213 --> 01:19:26,880
I'm sorry for all the shit, man.

1102
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:31,463
And I'm sorry
for you taking care of Amy and, uh...

1103
01:19:37,422 --> 01:19:38,755
Oh, I'm a fucking mess.

1104
01:19:39,172 --> 01:19:40,505
Hey.

1105
01:19:40,588 --> 01:19:41,588
Hey.

1106
01:19:42,547 --> 01:19:44,047
Take it easy.

1107
01:19:44,422 --> 01:19:46,130
Please. Come on, it's okay.

1108
01:19:47,338 --> 01:19:48,463
All right?

1109
01:19:50,005 --> 01:19:51,005
Hey.

1110
01:19:51,213 --> 01:19:52,213
Listen.

1111
01:19:52,672 --> 01:19:55,755
if you're serious about getting out,
I got your back.

1112
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:03,838
Thank you, brother.

1113
01:20:04,422 --> 01:20:05,255
Okay.

1114
01:20:05,422 --> 01:20:06,422
Hey.

1115
01:20:06,963 --> 01:20:08,130
Take care of yourself.

1116
01:20:08,505 --> 01:20:10,338
I'm gonna give
the department shrink a call.

1117
01:20:11,047 --> 01:20:12,880
See if she can make a recommendation.

1118
01:20:13,630 --> 01:20:15,088
Okay. I'll do it.

1119
01:20:15,838 --> 01:20:16,963
I'm gonna owe you one.

1120
01:20:17,755 --> 01:20:18,838
You're a good man, Holt.

1121
01:20:19,338 --> 01:20:21,088
No, I'm a dick and I know it.

1122
01:20:21,172 --> 01:20:23,005
But you're family, so...

1123
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:26,755
That's what we do, right?
We take care of each other.

1124
01:20:26,838 --> 01:20:27,838
Even the crazy ones.

1125
01:20:30,422 --> 01:20:31,422
I'll call you.

1126
01:20:41,505 --> 01:20:43,672
Yes, hi, this is, uh, Captain Holt.

1127
01:20:44,547 --> 01:20:47,922
I just need a last known address
for a Heather Russell.

1128
01:20:50,047 --> 01:20:51,047
Just a second.

1129
01:20:51,755 --> 01:20:53,755
Badge number 0304.

1130
01:20:56,672 --> 01:20:57,672
Yep.

1131
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:02,130
Uh-huh.

1132
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:04,005
Yeah, ready when you are.

1133
01:21:33,422 --> 01:21:36,172
Save up to 80 percent
by buying factory direct.

1134
01:21:36,255 --> 01:21:37,672
Ms. Russell?

1135
01:21:37,755 --> 01:21:40,338
...a direct diamond importer
and manufactures factory direct.

1136
01:21:40,422 --> 01:21:43,130
The Jewelry Factory has thousands
of diamonds and setting mounds

1137
01:21:43,213 --> 01:21:45,088
and guarantees the lowest price.

1138
01:21:45,172 --> 01:21:46,532
The Jewelry Factory's one-carat...

1139
01:21:46,588 --> 01:21:49,505
Ms. Russell, mind if I come in?

1140
01:21:49,588 --> 01:21:50,713
...are 899.

1141
01:21:50,797 --> 01:21:53,047
Three-quarter-carat bracelets are 149.

1142
01:21:53,505 --> 01:21:54,505
Hello?

1143
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:57,213
...and one-carat studs are 399.

1144
01:22:56,713 --> 01:22:57,713
Ah!

1145
01:23:06,255 --> 01:23:07,672
Hey! Stop, stop, stop, stop!

1146
01:23:09,672 --> 01:23:11,422
Get out of the car. Get out.

1147
01:23:11,505 --> 01:23:12,505
Get out!

1148
01:25:55,797 --> 01:25:56,797
Damn it.

1149
01:25:56,963 --> 01:25:57,963
Fuck!

1150
01:27:12,963 --> 01:27:13,963
No!

1151
01:27:25,713 --> 01:27:26,713
Fuck!

1152
01:27:33,963 --> 01:27:35,088
I'll see you soon.

1153
01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:15,588
Holt! Holt!

1154
01:28:16,005 --> 01:28:17,213
I shot her in the hand!

1155
01:28:17,755 --> 01:28:19,005
This is when she gets shot.

1156
01:28:19,088 --> 01:28:20,922
I'm the one who did it.
It already happened!

1157
01:28:21,005 --> 01:28:22,963
But we've gotta wait
nine more years, Holt.

1158
01:28:23,463 --> 01:28:24,338
We've gotta wait!

1159
01:28:24,422 --> 01:28:26,862
But listen, if we kill her,
we can stop it all from happening.

1160
01:28:26,922 --> 01:28:28,547
I could be there for Jeanie, Holt.

1161
01:28:28,630 --> 01:28:30,505
We can stop it all from happening, Holt!

1162
01:28:31,088 --> 01:28:31,922
Listen to me!

1163
01:28:32,005 --> 01:28:33,755
Hey, listen to me!

1164
01:28:34,713 --> 01:28:35,713
Listen!

1165
01:29:10,338 --> 01:29:11,338
Record.

1166
01:29:12,797 --> 01:29:15,380
Timestream location and determination.

1167
01:29:15,963 --> 01:29:17,130
Trial number 32.

1168
01:29:20,338 --> 01:29:22,297
Injecting marks one through three.

1169
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:33,880
Now...

1170
01:29:34,588 --> 01:29:38,047
attempting termination
of marks one through three.

1171
01:29:58,297 --> 01:30:00,547
I have brain dissolution on mark one.

1172
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:03,547
And on marks two and three.

1173
01:30:09,797 --> 01:30:11,255
I think we may have a winner.

1174
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:14,380
With the pairing of the coronal isotopes,

1175
01:30:14,463 --> 01:30:18,172
we could eventually be triggering
this solution from a future point in time.

1176
01:30:18,255 --> 01:30:20,130
Dr. Rao?

1177
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:28,005
Damn it.

1178
01:31:07,213 --> 01:31:08,922
Hey, Daddy. It's me.

1179
01:31:09,588 --> 01:31:10,588
It's, um...

1180
01:31:11,255 --> 01:31:12,630
been a while, so...

1181
01:31:13,505 --> 01:31:14,672
I'm calling because...

1182
01:31:15,838 --> 01:31:17,047
The baby's due soon.

1183
01:31:17,588 --> 01:31:19,338
Really soon, and, um...

1184
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:22,088
George and I
have been talking it over and...

1185
01:31:23,130 --> 01:31:24,713
I'd like you to be here for it.

1186
01:31:27,338 --> 01:31:29,713
I think it's what Mom
would have wanted, and...

1187
01:31:31,172 --> 01:31:33,255
I think it's what I want too, so...

1188
01:31:36,213 --> 01:31:37,213
I know...

1189
01:31:37,963 --> 01:31:39,838
I know it's that time of year again,

1190
01:31:39,922 --> 01:31:43,172
and I know things between us have been...

1191
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:48,005
But I'd still love it
if you could make it.

1192
01:31:49,088 --> 01:31:50,297
Either way, please...

1193
01:31:51,005 --> 01:31:52,047
call me back.

1194
01:32:09,255 --> 01:32:10,463
Daddy, what's wrong?

1195
01:32:20,713 --> 01:32:22,463
I knew you'd be back,
Mr. Lockhart.

1196
01:32:23,255 --> 01:32:25,005
I really am sorry about all this.

1197
01:32:27,672 --> 01:32:31,213
You're a hard man to find, Rao.
You disappeared on me.

1198
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:34,463
Of all people, you should understand
an obsession with work.

1199
01:32:34,547 --> 01:32:37,380
Yeah, speaking of work,
you can just let me out right here.

1200
01:32:38,047 --> 01:32:39,672
I'm afraid I cannot do that.

1201
01:32:39,755 --> 01:32:41,713
If you don't, she keeps killing.

1202
01:32:41,797 --> 01:32:42,838
That is the plan.

1203
01:32:44,047 --> 01:32:45,927
Changing the world
is a bloody business, Thomas.

1204
01:32:47,213 --> 01:32:48,213
Fucking crazy.

1205
01:32:49,838 --> 01:32:52,588
I think we're both a little
beyond the pale, really.

1206
01:32:57,547 --> 01:33:00,463
I'll be keeping you in a safe place
for the next few days.

1207
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:02,297
Then you'll be let go.

1208
01:33:03,588 --> 01:33:04,672
But truthfully...

1209
01:33:05,422 --> 01:33:06,963
I have to thank you.

1210
01:33:08,213 --> 01:33:12,088
It was your investigation that made me
realize she wasn't a murderer at all...

1211
01:33:12,713 --> 01:33:13,797
but a savior,

1212
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:19,172
and a culmination of my own research.

1213
01:33:19,255 --> 01:33:21,838
I'm developing the technology
she'll use one day.

1214
01:33:21,922 --> 01:33:22,922
Well...

1215
01:33:23,088 --> 01:33:24,838
is using now, really.

1216
01:33:25,713 --> 01:33:28,505
Time travel is complicated.
Hard for even me to wrap my head around.

1217
01:33:28,588 --> 01:33:30,130
She's killing innocent people!

1218
01:33:30,213 --> 01:33:33,338
To stop something much, much worse.

1219
01:33:35,297 --> 01:33:37,880
Imagine you could erase
the American Civil War.

1220
01:33:38,797 --> 01:33:39,797
How would you do it?

1221
01:33:40,755 --> 01:33:42,088
Would you kill Jefferson Davis?

1222
01:33:42,172 --> 01:33:44,797
Robert E. Lee? Lincoln?
All the Confederate and Union leaders?

1223
01:33:45,547 --> 01:33:47,838
But that might not be enough
to erase an idea.

1224
01:33:48,838 --> 01:33:51,255
Maybe we have to kill the people
who made them who they are,

1225
01:33:51,338 --> 01:33:54,130
who gave them their moral
and political beliefs.

1226
01:33:54,672 --> 01:33:56,505
Friends, fathers, mothers, grandparents.

1227
01:33:58,047 --> 01:34:02,047
How far back would you have to go
to snuff out the spark that lit the fuse?

1228
01:34:03,047 --> 01:34:06,672
But if you eliminated
the right combination of people,

1229
01:34:06,755 --> 01:34:08,297
one by one,

1230
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:10,172
until you got to the exact start of it,

1231
01:34:10,255 --> 01:34:13,088
until you got to the one
that undoes it all...

1232
01:34:14,172 --> 01:34:16,255
you could reshape the future.

1233
01:34:17,588 --> 01:34:19,005
And that's what she's doing.

1234
01:34:20,422 --> 01:34:22,005
And I won't let you stop her.

1235
01:34:25,588 --> 01:34:27,005
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1236
01:34:29,172 --> 01:34:31,713
We can't feel it's pull,
but we know it's always there.

1237
01:34:32,130 --> 01:34:33,338
Nothing escapes it.

1238
01:34:34,755 --> 01:34:37,963
You know, the moon is responsible
for conditions that allow life on Earth.

1239
01:34:38,963 --> 01:34:41,797
Well, now, it's responsible
for us being able to save ourselves

1240
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:43,547
from ourselves.

1241
01:34:45,047 --> 01:34:47,755
- It's... amazing.
- Yeah.

1242
01:36:15,505 --> 01:36:16,505
Shit!

1243
01:36:16,963 --> 01:36:18,088
Lock!

1244
01:36:19,963 --> 01:36:21,213
Stop!

1245
01:36:24,630 --> 01:36:26,338
Lock!

1246
01:36:27,463 --> 01:36:29,130
Don't do this!

1247
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:33,963
You have to let her finish!

1248
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:57,130
Morning.

1249
01:38:04,797 --> 01:38:06,338
You know, when I kill you...

1250
01:38:08,172 --> 01:38:10,047
you'll never be able to kill anybody.

1251
01:38:15,172 --> 01:38:17,922
Some version of me
won't have to chase you.

1252
01:38:21,838 --> 01:38:23,297
If you kill me now...

1253
01:38:25,255 --> 01:38:27,130
the world as you know it will end

1254
01:38:27,713 --> 01:38:29,338
in a very short time.

1255
01:38:29,922 --> 01:38:31,505
And you have no idea...

1256
01:38:32,130 --> 01:38:33,130
what's coming.

1257
01:38:34,463 --> 01:38:36,922
You're not the only one
trying to change the past.

1258
01:38:38,838 --> 01:38:40,547
I'll be a regular guy.

1259
01:38:43,463 --> 01:38:44,547
Regular family.

1260
01:38:54,755 --> 01:38:55,755
No.

1261
01:38:58,547 --> 01:38:59,630
You don't kill me.

1262
01:39:04,047 --> 01:39:05,047
'Cause I know you.

1263
01:39:10,588 --> 01:39:12,172
I've known you my entire life.

1264
01:39:14,838 --> 01:39:16,922
You're the one
who told me to take this job.

1265
01:39:24,422 --> 01:39:26,713
And you taught me how to ride a bicycle.

1266
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:33,963
You made me my first ice cream pancakes.

1267
01:39:38,755 --> 01:39:40,880
And you held me on the day I was born.

1268
01:39:51,338 --> 01:39:52,755
This was my mother's.

1269
01:40:20,005 --> 01:40:21,213
You're my granddaughter.

1270
01:40:28,505 --> 01:40:29,713
Believe it or not,

1271
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:32,505
you actually come around
to what I'm doing.

1272
01:40:37,630 --> 01:40:38,630
It's okay.

1273
01:40:41,588 --> 01:40:42,588
It's over.

1274
01:40:48,713 --> 01:40:49,713
No, no.

1275
01:40:50,630 --> 01:40:51,630
No.

1276
01:40:52,338 --> 01:40:53,463
But I do kill you.

1277
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:55,255
Twenty-seven years ago.

1278
01:40:56,630 --> 01:40:57,672
I watched you die.

1279
01:40:59,672 --> 01:41:00,755
You have to go back.

1280
01:41:01,713 --> 01:41:04,005
You have to go back
and you have to stop me.

1281
01:41:08,005 --> 01:41:09,588
Then it already happened.

1282
01:41:11,672 --> 01:41:13,755
Time travel is a one-way trip.

1283
01:41:15,713 --> 01:41:18,630
I can't go back
until my mission's complete.

1284
01:41:20,588 --> 01:41:24,255
If it begins with you warning me
here in this beach...

1285
01:41:26,213 --> 01:41:28,213
then it always ends with me dying.

1286
01:41:31,005 --> 01:41:32,005
No.

1287
01:41:47,755 --> 01:41:48,755
Go home.

1288
01:41:52,005 --> 01:41:53,213
Take care of mom.

1289
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:58,172
Take care of me.

1290
01:42:01,713 --> 01:42:02,713
I'm sorry.

1291
01:42:03,130 --> 01:42:04,463
I'll see you soon.

1292
01:42:11,422 --> 01:42:13,172
- I'm sorry.
- I have to go.

1293
01:42:13,255 --> 01:42:15,338
- I'm sorry.
- I have to go.

1294
01:42:49,463 --> 01:42:51,963
Welcome to Rao Technology.

1295
01:42:53,838 --> 01:42:55,213
Tide pull ready.

1296
01:42:55,755 --> 01:42:57,213
Bridge pending.

1297
01:43:03,297 --> 01:43:04,797
When I was nine...

1298
01:43:05,463 --> 01:43:08,963
an ordinary man parked an ordinary truck

1299
01:43:09,463 --> 01:43:11,963
full of homemade explosives downtown

1300
01:43:12,047 --> 01:43:13,547
and watched it explode.

1301
01:43:13,630 --> 01:43:16,838
- Electromagnetic levels primed.
- Seven, six...

1302
01:43:16,922 --> 01:43:19,880
- Programming destination. 2015.
- Five, four...

1303
01:43:19,963 --> 01:43:22,130
His attack was just the first.

1304
01:43:22,213 --> 01:43:23,213
...two...

1305
01:43:24,630 --> 01:43:27,672
Eleven thousand people died
the first morning.

1306
01:43:28,838 --> 01:43:31,755
Millions more in the Civil War
that followed.

1307
01:43:33,088 --> 01:43:34,713
It fed on anger.

1308
01:43:35,547 --> 01:43:37,713
It spread through fear.

1309
01:43:37,797 --> 01:43:38,922
Initializing.

1310
01:43:39,005 --> 01:43:41,297
It made monsters out of men.

1311
01:43:41,963 --> 01:43:43,922
Until even the ordinary

1312
01:43:44,547 --> 01:43:45,588
were broken...

1313
01:43:46,713 --> 01:43:47,713
one...

1314
01:43:48,922 --> 01:43:49,922
by one.

1315
01:43:54,172 --> 01:43:56,588
The voice that gave birth to a movement...

1316
01:43:58,672 --> 01:44:01,630
...turned a small crack
into a great divide.

1317
01:44:03,963 --> 01:44:06,088
It drowned out the best of us.

1318
01:44:07,547 --> 01:44:09,797
And it amplified the worst.

1319
01:44:11,172 --> 01:44:13,422
So we found a way to silence it.

1320
01:44:16,755 --> 01:44:20,172
We found a way to undo the damage.

1321
01:44:20,255 --> 01:44:21,755
Coronal fluid active.

1322
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:24,088
Timestream online.

1323
01:44:24,172 --> 01:44:26,088
To disconnect the dots.

1324
01:44:27,047 --> 01:44:29,422
Subject four terminated.

1325
01:44:33,422 --> 01:44:35,922
Subject three terminated.

1326
01:44:39,005 --> 01:44:40,463
Subject two...

1327
01:44:40,547 --> 01:44:43,672
I volunteered to untell the story.

1328
01:44:46,005 --> 01:44:47,422
Subject one...

1329
01:44:47,797 --> 01:44:48,797
terminated.

1330
01:44:49,047 --> 01:44:51,588
I came back to erase an idea.

1331
01:44:53,130 --> 01:44:55,713
Because some thoughts
are meant to be buried.

1332
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:59,088
Some before they even begin.

1333
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:22,963
When the war between us all disappears...

1334
01:45:24,755 --> 01:45:26,088
it won't make a sound.

1335
01:45:28,338 --> 01:45:29,880
It won't leave a scar.

1336
01:45:31,630 --> 01:45:34,422
There will be no great tale in your time.

1337
01:45:36,755 --> 01:45:39,130
Just an echo of what might have been.

1338
01:45:57,338 --> 01:45:58,338
But this...

1339
01:45:59,672 --> 01:46:01,672
this is your story.

1340
01:46:04,172 --> 01:46:05,797
And it doesn't end here.

1341
01:46:10,672 --> 01:46:12,630
It's written in sacrifice.

1342
01:46:15,505 --> 01:46:17,213
It's written in forgiveness.

1343
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:23,255
And it's time to start your next chapter.

1344
01:46:56,713 --> 01:46:58,005
You will love.

1345
01:47:00,588 --> 01:47:01,922
And you will heal.

1346
01:47:10,213 --> 01:47:12,255
You will teach me how to live.

1347
01:47:15,047 --> 01:47:16,922
And you will make me who I am.

1348
01:47:19,838 --> 01:47:20,838
A fighter.

1349
01:47:23,088 --> 01:47:24,213
Just like you.

1350
01:47:27,505 --> 01:47:28,797
Because right now...

1351
01:47:30,547 --> 01:47:31,963
both of our lives

1352
01:47:32,338 --> 01:47:34,130
are about to begin.

1353
01:47:35,213 --> 01:47:36,213
It's okay.

1354
01:47:37,755 --> 01:47:38,880
It's okay.

1355
01:47:41,755 --> 01:47:43,588
Everything's going to be okay.

1356
01:48:08,130 --> 01:48:11,213
 Streets full of people 

1357
01:48:12,297 --> 01:48:14,880
 All alone 

1358
01:48:16,297 --> 01:48:19,005
 Roads full of houses 

1359
01:48:20,213 --> 01:48:23,172
 Never home 

1360
01:48:24,255 --> 01:48:26,505
 A church full of singing 

1361
01:48:28,463 --> 01:48:30,963
 Out of tune 

1362
01:48:32,463 --> 01:48:34,755
 Everyone's gone 

1363
01:48:35,088 --> 01:48:36,463
 To the moon 

1364
01:48:40,505 --> 01:48:43,172
 A long time ago 

1365
01:48:44,630 --> 01:48:46,963
 Life had begun 

1366
01:48:48,588 --> 01:48:50,630
 Everyone went 

1367
01:48:51,047 --> 01:48:52,672
 To the sun 

1368
01:48:56,755 --> 01:48:59,338
 Parks full of motors 

1369
01:49:00,838 --> 01:49:03,463
 Painted green 

1370
01:49:04,713 --> 01:49:07,338
 Mouths full of chocolate... 

1371
01:49:08,755 --> 01:49:11,838
 ...covered cream 

1372
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:15,838
 Arms that can only 

1373
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:19,963
 Lift a spoon 

1374
01:49:21,005 --> 01:49:23,088
 Everyone's gone 

1375
01:49:23,630 --> 01:49:25,713
 To the moon 

1376
01:49:29,130 --> 01:49:31,255
 Everyone's gone 

1377
01:49:31,755 --> 01:49:34,047
 To the moon 

1378
01:49:37,213 --> 01:49:39,255
 Everyone's gone 

1379
01:49:39,755 --> 01:49:41,547
 To the moon
