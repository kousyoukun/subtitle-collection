1
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:46,208
Okay, see you tomorrow.

2
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:19,133
<i>From Independence Mall,
this is news radio, KYW Philadelphia ten...</i>

3
00:05:40,755 --> 00:05:44,165
<i>Absolute chaotic scene
behind me right now at this intersection,</i>

4
00:05:44,255 --> 00:05:45,505
<i>where just earlier this evening</i>

5
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,840
<i>a bus driver collided
with several oncoming vehicles,</i>

6
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:51,512
<i>- one of them a cement mixer.</i>
<i>- </i>All right, here we go.

7
00:05:51,588 --> 00:05:53,798
<i>A huge mess on the scene here right now.</i>

8
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,340
<i>We're still not clear
as to what exactly happened here,</i>

9
00:05:57,422 --> 00:06:01,382
<i>whether the driver passed out
while operating the vehicle</i>

10
00:06:01,463 --> 00:06:03,173
<i>or simply died at the wheel.</i>

11
00:06:04,005 --> 00:06:06,165
<i>We don't have a cause of death
at this point,</i>

12
00:06:06,255 --> 00:06:08,625
<i>but some of our medical experts
are talking about the fact</i>

13
00:06:08,713 --> 00:06:10,173
<i>that it could've been a heart attack</i>

14
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:11,795
<i>- or a stroke.</i>
- Mmm, perfect pancake!

15
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,960
<i>We don't have a name on the driver,
no information at all.</i>

16
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:16,807
<i>Police have not released that
at this point.</i>

17
00:06:16,838 --> 00:06:19,088
<i>- Next of kin still being notified.</i>

18
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:21,052
<i>But no other casualties reported,</i>

19
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,760
<i>- which is a minor miracle.</i>
- Fuck.

20
00:06:22,838 --> 00:06:25,208
<i>Speaking with some of the officers
here on the scene...</i>

21
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:26,297
Fuck.

22
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:28,628
Shit.

23
00:06:29,547 --> 00:06:32,047
- Shit.
<i>- There could have been more fatalities</i>

24
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,010
<i>is what these officers are saying to me.
Uh, we...</i>

25
00:06:35,088 --> 00:06:37,258
You burned 'em again,
didn't you?

26
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:39,378
No! No, no, nothing's burnt.

27
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:43,092
Ah, come on.

28
00:06:48,505 --> 00:06:49,835
Yes, I'll be right out.

29
00:06:52,297 --> 00:06:53,797
Ah, Jesus.

30
00:06:56,963 --> 00:06:58,423
Hey, hey, baby.

31
00:07:00,172 --> 00:07:01,262
- Hmm.
- Hey.

32
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:03,838
Was that Maddox?

33
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,590
Yeah. I gotta go soon.

34
00:07:06,588 --> 00:07:08,168
I feel like a piÃ±ata.

35
00:07:08,255 --> 00:07:09,705
How's my baby girl?

36
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:11,257
Kicking up a storm.

37
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:13,548
Feels like she got your big feet.

38
00:07:13,797 --> 00:07:15,797
Maybe I'll pick up some Doc Martens
on the way out.

39
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:18,213
Come on up.

40
00:07:21,255 --> 00:07:22,255
- Here.
- Ah.

41
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:25,377
Had that weird pregnancy dream again.

42
00:07:25,463 --> 00:07:26,463
Oh, no.

43
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,130
We were still on the beach,
but a little different this time.

44
00:07:31,547 --> 00:07:34,207
I couldn't see you,
but I knew you were with me,

45
00:07:34,297 --> 00:07:37,837
like how sometimes you just know
things like that in a dream.

46
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:40,012
Honey, you seen my other shoe?

47
00:07:40,422 --> 00:07:41,882
Your shoes are under the bed.

48
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:43,342
Go on, I'm listening.

49
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,918
So we were standing
in the shallow water,

50
00:07:46,005 --> 00:07:49,005
and we were playing that game
like you play as a kid.

51
00:07:49,922 --> 00:07:52,052
When the tide would go back out

52
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,920
you'd twist a little and...

53
00:07:54,838 --> 00:07:57,508
and sink lower
into the wet sand.

54
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,590
I just kept sinking down and down,

55
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:03,552
and no matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't get up.

56
00:08:06,963 --> 00:08:08,383
- Tommy?
- What?

57
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:12,208
You make the worst pancakes.

58
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,340
I've gotta go, okay?

59
00:08:17,922 --> 00:08:19,712
I love you, Tommy Lockhart.

60
00:08:19,922 --> 00:08:20,922
I love you more.

61
00:08:21,172 --> 00:08:23,802
But these graveyard shifts are the worst.

62
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,798
I'm tired of having breakfast for dinner.

63
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,380
And they're almost over, okay?

64
00:08:29,463 --> 00:08:31,963
- Detective's around the corner.
- Mm-hmm.

65
00:08:32,297 --> 00:08:34,417
But I'll bring you something back
to make up for it.

66
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:36,915
Oh, promises promises.

67
00:08:38,338 --> 00:08:39,758
So, I pinky swear.

68
00:08:41,547 --> 00:08:44,007
- I look forward to being proven wrong.
- Deal.

69
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,760
<i>With the shot clock winding
down, Barkley coming up short once again.</i>

70
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:52,798
<i>Another good night of rebounding
for Charles, but not enough buckets.</i>

71
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,960
Come on, Barkley.

72
00:08:56,297 --> 00:08:57,837
Shit.

73
00:08:59,213 --> 00:09:00,213
About time.

74
00:09:00,797 --> 00:09:01,667
Yeah.

75
00:09:01,755 --> 00:09:03,915
<i>Now the Sixers playoff...</i>

76
00:09:04,338 --> 00:09:06,918
Hey, come on, I wanna see how it ends.

77
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:10,205
Huh, Winston Maddox, you got some amount
of money riding on this tonight?

78
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:11,127
Shit.

79
00:09:11,213 --> 00:09:12,383
- Yeah?
- Don't do it.

80
00:09:15,797 --> 00:09:17,627
<i>And that's all she wrote, folks.</i>

81
00:09:17,713 --> 00:09:21,463
<i>Philadelphia loses a heartbreaker
to Atlanta, 103 to 101.</i>

82
00:09:22,338 --> 00:09:23,458
Well, there you go.

83
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:25,547
Thanks for that.

84
00:09:25,588 --> 00:09:26,588
How much?

85
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,670
Thought most folks think about
moving out of white trash neighborhoods.

86
00:09:36,755 --> 00:09:38,755
Yeah, yeah. Trust me, I'm working on it.

87
00:09:39,588 --> 00:09:42,878
You know, the first perp that ever took
a swing at me was two blocks that way.

88
00:09:42,963 --> 00:09:44,963
Oh, yeah. You never mentioned it.

89
00:09:46,047 --> 00:09:49,257
Yeah, you're all jokes now, but you've got
a pregnant wife back there, pal.

90
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,548
Trust me, I know.

91
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,510
Back pain,
feet the size of a kitchen sink.

92
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:55,338
She's cranky, she's hungry...

93
00:09:55,422 --> 00:09:56,592
Yeah, I remember those days.

94
00:09:56,672 --> 00:09:59,262
But hey, maybe you can find the guy
that knocked her up

95
00:09:59,338 --> 00:10:01,418
- and make him deal with it.
- Fuck you.

96
00:10:02,797 --> 00:10:03,917
All right, what do we got?

97
00:10:04,005 --> 00:10:06,255
We've got a big pile-up downtown.

98
00:10:06,338 --> 00:10:07,338
The city bus?

99
00:10:07,713 --> 00:10:11,133
That's bridge traffic.
That's gonna be, I don't know, 30 minutes?

100
00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:13,205
Ten spot says I'll get us there in 20.

101
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,380
I'll take that.

102
00:10:47,505 --> 00:10:49,005
Oh, 22 minutes. You owe me ten.

103
00:10:49,588 --> 00:10:50,798
Shit.

104
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,960
I want a recount.

105
00:10:57,755 --> 00:10:59,125
Oh, fuck. Holt's here.

106
00:10:59,755 --> 00:11:02,205
You know, when he, uh,
dry cleans his ties, it's full starch.

107
00:11:02,297 --> 00:11:03,127
What a dick.

108
00:11:03,213 --> 00:11:06,053
- Hey, that's my wife's brother.
- Tell me he's not a dick.

109
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,380
- Maintain a safe distance at all times.
- Keep it clear over there!

110
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,880
This whole thing is nuts.
You should've seen the bus driver.

111
00:11:13,963 --> 00:11:16,013
- You would have loved it.
- Yeah? Why?

112
00:11:16,088 --> 00:11:17,758
Oh, trust me, she's a doozy.

113
00:11:19,005 --> 00:11:20,085
No, man, don't do it.

114
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:24,088
- Don't do it. You know how Holt gets.
- I'll just take a peek.

115
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,960
Is a normal, boring shift too much to ask?

116
00:11:43,547 --> 00:11:44,957
Blood's not from her injury.

117
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,455
You got some gloves?

118
00:11:47,547 --> 00:11:48,917
You got a detective badge?

119
00:11:50,463 --> 00:11:51,633
I'll bum you a smoke.

120
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,050
Oh, God, do you smell that?

121
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:01,627
Severe hemorrhage...

122
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,050
then hit hard on the steering wheel.

123
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,590
Yeah, but why the hemorrhage?

124
00:12:13,088 --> 00:12:14,588
What the fuck?

125
00:12:14,922 --> 00:12:15,922
Empty.

126
00:12:17,963 --> 00:12:19,593
Whoa, don't touch that.

127
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,380
Pieces of brain.

128
00:12:25,463 --> 00:12:26,923
Goddamn.

129
00:12:27,838 --> 00:12:29,628
Who invited you two to the party?

130
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:33,755
Officers, I'm gonna need you to dust
all this broken glass for fingerprints.

131
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,512
I'm just fucking with you.

132
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,260
Yeah.

133
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,300
So how's my sis? She about to explode?

134
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,880
Yeah, any day. Uh, you know, these are...

135
00:12:45,963 --> 00:12:47,133
Chunks of brain.

136
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:49,507
Yep, we solved that one, Crockett.

137
00:12:58,588 --> 00:12:59,758
Yeah? What about that?

138
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:02,877
Uh, birthmark.

139
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:04,053
Maybe a rash.

140
00:13:05,922 --> 00:13:07,382
Looks like a puncture wound.

141
00:13:08,463 --> 00:13:09,593
Sure, sharp glass.

142
00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:12,798
Boys across town
just caught two more bodies.

143
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,090
Bled out: ears, nose, mouth.

144
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,510
They said both had some kind of mark
on their neck.

145
00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:20,335
A whole lot of birthmarks.

146
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,150
Pump your brakes, all right?
You've had your five minutes.

147
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:24,172
Come on.

148
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,630
Nah.

149
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:31,053
We're not gonna go.

150
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:33,415
We're gonna stay here. We'll relax.

151
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:35,335
Find our center.

152
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,460
Practice our breathing.

153
00:13:38,547 --> 00:13:41,917
Plenty of people can stand behind tape,
yell at reporters. Come on.

154
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,088
I'll drive!

155
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,255
Come on.

156
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:06,005
Shit.

157
00:14:07,463 --> 00:14:08,963
You guys going on tour?

158
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,210
Hey, just trying to learn
from the best, Detective.

159
00:14:13,588 --> 00:14:14,588
Okay.

160
00:14:15,297 --> 00:14:17,507
- Go ahead.
- Well, there was just blood everywhere.

161
00:14:28,297 --> 00:14:29,797
But no brains on this one.

162
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:40,712
Oh! There we go.

163
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,627
Ah, Jesus!

164
00:14:43,755 --> 00:14:46,335
No kind of hemorrhage I know of
includes brain disintegration.

165
00:14:46,422 --> 00:14:49,802
It could be a drug thing,
you know, puncture wounds.

166
00:14:50,338 --> 00:14:53,128
- What we need to do is run toxicology.
- What do you mean, "we"?

167
00:14:53,213 --> 00:14:55,423
Look, you were right
about the bus driver, good call,

168
00:14:55,505 --> 00:14:58,205
but I'm running point on this.
You do your job, I'll do mine.

169
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,757
- Come on, give me a bone here.
- Detective! Detective Holt!

170
00:15:00,838 --> 00:15:03,168
Look, look, look,
I respect the hustle, I do,

171
00:15:03,255 --> 00:15:04,255
- but...
- Detective!

172
00:15:04,755 --> 00:15:08,585
Look, even though nobody said the word
"serial killer" out loud yet,

173
00:15:08,672 --> 00:15:10,672
that time's coming, and when it does...

174
00:15:11,422 --> 00:15:13,632
this is my first big one, okay.

175
00:15:14,088 --> 00:15:15,168
This could make me.

176
00:15:15,755 --> 00:15:17,875
I need to be able
to wrap my head around it on my own.

177
00:15:17,963 --> 00:15:20,593
Just give me a little breathing room,
all right?

178
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:22,958
- All right.
- Detective!

179
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,757
Detective, what can you tell us
about the other two victims?

180
00:15:25,838 --> 00:15:28,088
Sorry, everybody,
no official statement yet.

181
00:15:28,172 --> 00:15:30,262
You know the drill,
we're still collecting evidence.

182
00:15:30,338 --> 00:15:32,168
Is there a connection
to the other deaths?

183
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:34,815
- What'd I tell you? He's a dick.
- I can't answer that question,

184
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,590
and even if I could,
I wouldn't do it right here, okay?

185
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:55,555
Eh, you're just making
more work for yourself,

186
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:58,128
and more importantly, more work for me.

187
00:15:58,213 --> 00:16:00,093
You don't want to see
where this goes? Huh?

188
00:16:01,172 --> 00:16:04,342
Shit. I wanna go kick bums
out of the park like we're supposed to.

189
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,092
Yeah, well, bums will still be there
when we're done, bud.

190
00:16:07,755 --> 00:16:09,125
Hey, you Dr. Hanson?

191
00:16:09,213 --> 00:16:10,053
Yeah.

192
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,210
Yeah, three bodies came in tonight,
all of them had brain hemorrhaging,

193
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:14,957
marks in the back of their neck.

194
00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:15,877
And who are you?

195
00:16:15,963 --> 00:16:18,343
Oh, I'm, uh, Officer Lockhart.
This is Officer Maddox.

196
00:16:18,422 --> 00:16:20,922
Okay. Well, there's been a hold
placed on that report

197
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:22,795
by detective Brian Holt.

198
00:16:23,005 --> 00:16:23,835
Surprise.

199
00:16:23,922 --> 00:16:26,762
- Yeah, he's family, sir. I'm sure...
- I said a hold, Officer.

200
00:16:26,838 --> 00:16:30,088
Can't break protocol every time
some idiot's stuck with a needle.

201
00:16:31,422 --> 00:16:32,592
So it was a puncture wound.

202
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,710
Injection sites.

203
00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:41,167
And deep enough to impact the vertebrate.

204
00:16:41,547 --> 00:16:44,917
So, some kind of poison,
like blowfish toxin?

205
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,455
No. An unstable isotope.

206
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:49,505
Some shit.

207
00:16:49,672 --> 00:16:51,632
Lab techs all have hard-ons for it.

208
00:16:52,005 --> 00:16:53,005
Why?

209
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,050
Because we have no idea what it is.

210
00:16:56,838 --> 00:16:58,298
No one's ever seen it before.

211
00:16:58,922 --> 00:17:00,342
Now, if you'll excuse me...

212
00:17:01,213 --> 00:17:02,963
I've got other dead people waitin'.

213
00:17:06,463 --> 00:17:08,133
All right, we need to think.

214
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:12,088
Hoagies.

215
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:13,463
Last night.

216
00:17:13,797 --> 00:17:15,087
- Pizza.
- Too greasy.

217
00:17:15,922 --> 00:17:17,212
Oriental it is.

218
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:19,667
You know, I think
you're supposed to say "Asian" now.

219
00:17:19,755 --> 00:17:22,505
Whatever, as long as they keep
that sweet and sour pork coming,

220
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:24,458
I'll call 'em whatever they want. Shit.

221
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,260
Listen, all I'm saying is
we got people getting injected

222
00:17:29,338 --> 00:17:32,508
with a fucking isotope of all things,
and nobody can tell us shit.

223
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:35,388
And the times of death are minutes apart,
the bodies are miles apart...

224
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:36,262
How does that work?

225
00:17:36,338 --> 00:17:38,878
I'll take "crazy shit happens"
for 200, Alex.

226
00:17:38,963 --> 00:17:41,693
We had three random victims
with the brains melted out of their faces.

227
00:17:41,713 --> 00:17:43,053
That means nothing to you?

228
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:45,758
I'll admit, it's weird, but... shit.

229
00:17:46,505 --> 00:17:49,585
Remember them two yuppies washed up
on the shore of the lake couple years ago?

230
00:17:49,672 --> 00:17:52,552
Buck naked, bruised up.
Everybody thought it was a mob hit.

231
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,420
Turns out it was just two gays,
liked it rough,

232
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:57,975
having a bit too much to drink
before they went skinny dipping.

233
00:17:58,005 --> 00:17:59,685
But you heard
what the coroner said, right?

234
00:17:59,713 --> 00:18:02,093
Man, your energy's
all over the place, man.

235
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,210
Let the game come to you.

236
00:18:05,297 --> 00:18:06,797
Says the grand master.

237
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:08,343
Everything else aside,

238
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,343
I say this from experience,

239
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:12,627
once that kiddo arrives...

240
00:18:13,713 --> 00:18:15,053
that'll be the whole boat.

241
00:18:16,213 --> 00:18:19,093
You won't have time
to think about shit this much. It'll be...

242
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:20,922
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- Background noise.

243
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,260
- I hope.
- Give me that ten bucks.

244
00:18:23,338 --> 00:18:24,338
Mmm.

245
00:18:24,797 --> 00:18:26,377
Say what now?

246
00:18:26,463 --> 00:18:29,103
It's not my fault you've got
a gambling problem. Give me the money.

247
00:18:29,838 --> 00:18:30,958
Thank you. Hold that.

248
00:18:31,672 --> 00:18:33,672
Hey, I'll strike you a deal here.

249
00:18:33,755 --> 00:18:35,585
Uh, give me that... that for ten?

250
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:38,963
Yeah.

251
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:43,755
Thank you.

252
00:18:44,297 --> 00:18:45,507
Gonna make a girl happy.

253
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:47,047
Appreciate it.

254
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,418
Oh.

255
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:54,205
Oh, come on, I was gonna eat that.

256
00:18:54,463 --> 00:18:55,463
You're kidding me.

257
00:18:55,713 --> 00:18:56,713
Put it on my tab.

258
00:18:57,047 --> 00:18:58,047
What tab?

259
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:02,590
<i>Units be advised 314

Uh, dispatch, this is car 39.

263
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,920
Could you get the officer at Hydra
and get me on the radio?

264
00:19:15,297 --> 00:19:18,667
- <i>Go for it, Officer Palmer.</i>
- Evening. Officer Lockhart here.

265
00:19:18,755 --> 00:19:21,125
You mind looking at the back
of your victim's neck?

266
00:19:22,672 --> 00:19:23,672
<i>All right.</i>

267
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:25,297
See anything?

268
00:19:27,422 --> 00:19:30,052
<i>Yeah, three bumps.
Little circles.</i>

269
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,380
What about the blood?

270
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:33,593
Anything weird?

271
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:36,585
<i>What blood? She's still alive.</i>

272
00:19:36,963 --> 00:19:39,013
All right, we're on our way.

273
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,518
Girl says she was stabbed
with some kind of metal tool or some shit.

274
00:20:17,547 --> 00:20:18,377
Metal tool?

275
00:20:18,463 --> 00:20:20,593
Last week we had a guy come in
from this place,

276
00:20:20,672 --> 00:20:22,842
egg beater stuck up his ass,
I shit you not.

277
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,258
I was too impressed to be disgusted.

278
00:20:34,338 --> 00:20:35,548
All right, let's see it.

279
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:43,298
All right, tell me what happened.

280
00:20:45,338 --> 00:20:46,458
She had on a blue hoodie.

281
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:48,213
"She"?

282
00:20:48,505 --> 00:20:50,005
Honey, you sure she's a "she"?

283
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,420
Yes, yeah.

284
00:20:53,047 --> 00:20:54,667
- Yes.
- What'd she look like?

285
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,797
Like she was in the wrong neighborhood.

286
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,380
Black.

287
00:21:02,713 --> 00:21:04,013
All right, anything else?

288
00:21:06,255 --> 00:21:07,375
Yeah, um...

289
00:21:07,963 --> 00:21:10,513
Her hand was all messed up.
It was covered in dried blood.

290
00:21:11,172 --> 00:21:12,172
Okay, which hand?

291
00:21:12,963 --> 00:21:13,963
I...

292
00:21:15,047 --> 00:21:16,917
Okay, it's okay. Which hand? Right here.

293
00:21:17,005 --> 00:21:18,005
Um...

294
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,130
- Her left. Left.
- Left hand.

295
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:21,523
- Yeah.
- Okay, you're doing great.

296
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:24,587
Tom, I just got off with the coroner.
What the hell?

297
00:21:24,672 --> 00:21:26,552
Yeah, I was just about to get you
on the radio.

298
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,170
Just please step outside.

299
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,270
Listen, she's got that shit
in her bloodstream. We need to...

300
00:21:31,297 --> 00:21:32,457
Step aside.

301
00:21:32,547 --> 00:21:33,757
What do you mean, "shit"?

302
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,570
Don't even listen to him. It's fine.

303
00:21:36,005 --> 00:21:37,005
Okay.

304
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:39,592
From the top. What happened?

305
00:21:40,255 --> 00:21:41,695
Come on, I just told him everything.

306
00:21:41,755 --> 00:21:44,165
He's a little deaf. I want you to tell me.

307
00:21:46,422 --> 00:21:47,962
I was just dancing, okay,

308
00:21:48,047 --> 00:21:50,547
and out of nowhere,
this crazy chick tackles me to the ground.

309
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,960
She was real strong, too.

310
00:21:52,172 --> 00:21:54,632
These guys, they...
they pulled her off me, but...

311
00:21:55,505 --> 00:21:58,505
she... she poked my neck with something.

312
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,880
Miss?

313
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,760
Jesus. Hey, hey, hey!

314
00:22:04,838 --> 00:22:05,878
I need some help here!

315
00:22:05,963 --> 00:22:06,803
Whoa, whoa!

316
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,710
I need an EMT!

317
00:22:07,797 --> 00:22:09,627
We need an EMT now! Hey! Now, now, now!

318
00:22:09,713 --> 00:22:12,053
Get a medic up here! Get a medic up here!
Hey, hey, hey!

319
00:22:13,672 --> 00:22:16,172
<i>Stand by for a single live BOLO.</i>

<i>Repeat, Chestnut and University.</i>

330
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,335
This is our chance at detective.

331
00:23:45,547 --> 00:23:47,417
Don't tell me
you're not thinking about it.

332
00:23:47,755 --> 00:23:49,835
I'm thinking I got
the wrong skin tone for that.

333
00:23:49,922 --> 00:23:52,302
But you got that sparkling personality.

334
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,880
Shit.

335
00:23:57,297 --> 00:23:58,957
Hey, move it!

336
00:24:00,713 --> 00:24:01,633
Get out of the way.

337
00:24:01,713 --> 00:24:03,463
Move along, people.

338
00:24:07,755 --> 00:24:10,255
- Mm-mm-mm.
- Hey. Right there.

339
00:24:12,672 --> 00:24:14,302
- Right there.
- Whoa, look, man.

340
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,860
You about to draw down on Old Saint Nick.
You almost killed Christmas.

341
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,130
Whoa!

342
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:24,633
- Hey!
- Holy shit.

343
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:31,375
Whoa!

344
00:24:31,463 --> 00:24:33,763
What are you doing, man?

345
00:24:34,213 --> 00:24:35,303
Come on!

346
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,380
Goddamn.

347
00:24:37,588 --> 00:24:38,838
Come on.

348
00:24:39,963 --> 00:24:41,263
Ah!

349
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:44,088
Suspect heading west across Liberty!

00:24:46,172 --> 00:24:50,462
I repeat, suspect heading west
across Liberty!

351
00:24:51,047 --> 00:24:53,457
If you've got a badge on your chest
and a gun on your hip,

352
00:24:53,547 --> 00:24:55,627
I want you at that position now.

353
00:25:01,463 --> 00:25:03,053
- Whoa, whoa!
- Goddamn!

354
00:25:03,547 --> 00:25:05,167
No, no, no!

355
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:06,625
Goddamn! Goddamn!

356
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:07,713
- Goddamn!

357
00:25:09,005 --> 00:25:10,165
Whoa!

358
00:25:10,505 --> 00:25:11,795
I got kids, man.

359
00:25:13,588 --> 00:25:14,918
Truck! Truck!

360
00:25:16,963 --> 00:25:18,053
Whoa!

361
00:25:22,422 --> 00:25:23,802
Go around! Go around!

362
00:25:24,922 --> 00:25:26,922
Police! Move! Go! Get out of the way!

363
00:25:31,338 --> 00:25:32,418
Move!

364
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,512
Out of the way! Go! Move!

365
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:45,128
- Lock, she went this way!
- Hey!

366
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:47,755
Move!

367
00:25:54,047 --> 00:25:56,337
I got this! I got this!
Go around! Go around!

368
00:26:16,797 --> 00:26:18,457
I gotta cut back to a pack a day.

369
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:21,713
What do you got?

370
00:26:26,213 --> 00:26:27,263
I got eyes on her!

371
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,130
All right.

372
00:26:40,297 --> 00:26:41,957
Meet me at Girard subway station.

373
00:26:42,255 --> 00:26:43,295
Block all the exits.

374
00:26:43,797 --> 00:26:45,627
<i>What the fuck
are you talking about?</i>

375
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,375
I'm flushing her out.

376
00:26:48,463 --> 00:26:49,463
Shit!

377
00:26:58,838 --> 00:27:00,378
You two, on the door!

378
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,960
No one in and no one out!

379
00:27:02,047 --> 00:27:03,257
You two, come with me.

380
00:27:08,797 --> 00:27:09,797
Out of the way!

381
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,170
Philly PD, get the fuck out of here!

382
00:27:17,713 --> 00:27:19,303
What the hell?

383
00:27:33,963 --> 00:27:34,963
Come on.

384
00:27:39,088 --> 00:27:42,008
<i>Officer Lockhart,
I've got Rosewood General on the line.</i>

385
00:27:42,088 --> 00:27:43,588
<i>Your wife's going into labor.</i>

386
00:27:43,672 --> 00:27:45,092
<i>She's being taken there now.</i>

387
00:27:45,505 --> 00:27:47,165
<i>Officer Lockhart, please respond.</i>

388
00:27:48,422 --> 00:27:49,842
You two, stay on this level.

389
00:28:27,547 --> 00:28:28,547
Lock?

390
00:28:30,047 --> 00:28:31,047
I got her.

391
00:28:38,255 --> 00:28:39,755
I'm a police officer.

392
00:28:41,338 --> 00:28:42,798
We've got the exits sealed.

393
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,460
Why don't you come on out?

394
00:28:46,672 --> 00:28:47,762
Put your hands up.

395
00:29:03,713 --> 00:29:04,553
Lock!

396
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,460
Hey! Hey!

397
00:29:13,547 --> 00:29:14,627
Maddox!

398
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,550
Maddox! Maddox!

399
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,920
Hey, what happened?

400
00:29:24,297 --> 00:29:25,917
Got the wind knocked out of me.

401
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,010
Go. Go!

402
00:29:28,088 --> 00:29:29,088
Lock!

403
00:29:31,422 --> 00:29:33,922
Fuck! I think she broke my leg.

404
00:29:34,255 --> 00:29:35,585
Goddammit.

405
00:29:37,338 --> 00:29:39,418
Officer down. Officer down.

406
00:29:39,672 --> 00:29:42,052
I need an ambulance
at the Girard Street subway.

407
00:29:46,255 --> 00:29:47,835
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

408
00:29:47,922 --> 00:29:50,132
Stay right there.
Stay right fucking there!

409
00:29:51,463 --> 00:29:52,513
Put your hands up.

410
00:29:52,838 --> 00:29:53,668
Now!

411
00:29:53,755 --> 00:29:55,005
Put your hands up.

412
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:58,632
Get on the ground.

413
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,667
Get on the ground. Hey, hey!

414
00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:03,167
You fucking deaf?
I said get on the ground.

415
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,170
Hello, Thomas.

416
00:30:08,547 --> 00:30:09,957
This is where it happens.

417
00:30:11,213 --> 00:30:12,213
What?

418
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:15,213
What'd you say?

419
00:30:16,797 --> 00:30:18,667
Congratulations on your daughter.

420
00:30:20,713 --> 00:30:21,803
Shut the fuck up.

421
00:30:22,713 --> 00:30:24,053
I said get on the ground!

422
00:30:27,797 --> 00:30:29,127
I want you to know...

423
00:30:31,213 --> 00:30:33,173
I'm sorry about your partner.

424
00:30:37,297 --> 00:30:38,457
I never meant to...

425
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:40,882
Fuckin' stop talking.

426
00:31:12,172 --> 00:31:13,302
I'll see you soon.

427
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:22,133
No! No!

428
00:32:14,672 --> 00:32:16,012
Step back, guys.

429
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:31,713
Whoa, pal!
Hey, what are you still doing here?

430
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,130
Did nobody tell you?

431
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,047
Excuse me.

432
00:32:48,255 --> 00:32:49,255
Officer Lockhart?

433
00:32:49,297 --> 00:32:51,127
Yes, sir. Uh, where's the maternity ward?

434
00:32:51,213 --> 00:32:54,133
Uh, next building, down the hallway,
elevator to the third floor.

435
00:32:54,213 --> 00:32:56,653
I know it's not the best time,
but I need to check a few boxes

436
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:57,883
while it's still fresh.

437
00:32:57,963 --> 00:32:59,013
Lockhart. Lockhart!

438
00:33:03,963 --> 00:33:05,803
Okay, so far, she's a nobody,

439
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,300
no ID, no fingerprint matches, nothing.

440
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,760
All she had on her were these keys.
We have no idea what they go to.

441
00:33:11,838 --> 00:33:13,558
We're drawing a blank.
Mean anything to you?

442
00:33:13,588 --> 00:33:15,458
- No.
- I'll need to see your revolver.

443
00:33:15,547 --> 00:33:16,627
- What?
- Your revolver!

444
00:33:17,922 --> 00:33:18,922
Here.

445
00:33:19,922 --> 00:33:20,922
Jeanette Lockhart?

446
00:33:21,047 --> 00:33:23,967
- Lockhart. Just give me one moment.
- You didn't fire your weapon at all?

447
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:26,798
- No.
- Well, somebody did.

448
00:33:28,255 --> 00:33:30,295
<i>They pulled a bullet
from our girl's wrist...</i>

449
00:33:30,713 --> 00:33:32,343
and it matches a service revolver.

450
00:33:32,422 --> 00:33:35,262
- What are you talking about?
- No one else reported a shot fired.

451
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:37,423
We can't make heads or tails.

452
00:33:37,963 --> 00:33:38,963
So...

453
00:33:39,297 --> 00:33:41,547
what happened down there, son,
in the subway station?

454
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,960
Are you Jeanette's husband?

455
00:33:44,047 --> 00:33:46,087
Yes, yes. Hi, I'm... I'm Tom...
Tom Lockhart.

456
00:33:46,172 --> 00:33:48,012
There's been a complication.

457
00:33:48,547 --> 00:33:49,707
Placental abruption.

458
00:33:49,797 --> 00:33:50,707
What?

459
00:33:50,797 --> 00:33:51,797
She's hemorrhaging.

460
00:33:52,213 --> 00:33:54,303
But so far,
the baby appears to be safe.

461
00:33:56,713 --> 00:33:59,213
Push!

462
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:01,795
Keep going! Keep going!

463
00:34:03,963 --> 00:34:05,173
Come on, Jeanie!

464
00:34:06,505 --> 00:34:08,085
Hey, I'm right here.

465
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,553
I'm right here. I'm right here, baby.

466
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
You're doing great.

467
00:34:11,922 --> 00:34:13,632
It's okay. Yeah.

468
00:34:13,713 --> 00:34:16,093
It's okay. Look, I got you something.

469
00:34:16,172 --> 00:34:18,632
I got you something good.
Yeah, I got you a bracelet.

470
00:34:18,713 --> 00:34:21,673
We're gonna push right through this.
We're gonna push right through this.

471
00:34:22,922 --> 00:34:26,052
- Okay. Come on, Jeanie, one more push.
- You're almost there, Mrs. Lockhart.

472
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,050
Come on.

473
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,420
The next one, big push, okay, Jeanie?
Jeanie?

474
00:34:29,505 --> 00:34:31,165
- Honey, come on.
- Jeanie?

475
00:34:31,713 --> 00:34:34,133
- What are her vitals?
- Baby? Honey?!

476
00:34:35,713 --> 00:34:37,513
- Get out of the room!
- Honey, honey!

477
00:34:37,588 --> 00:34:38,418
Hey!

478
00:34:38,505 --> 00:34:39,505
I got CPR!

479
00:35:27,588 --> 00:35:28,588
It's okay.

480
00:35:28,922 --> 00:35:31,052
It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.

481
00:36:35,422 --> 00:36:37,962
<i>I'm here on location in Center City</i>

482
00:36:38,047 --> 00:36:41,207
<i>on the nine-year anniversary
of the Market Street murders.</i>

483
00:36:41,297 --> 00:36:44,207
<i>As you can see,
protesters have gathered here once again.</i>

484
00:36:44,297 --> 00:36:46,127
<i>They're calling for a new investigation</i>

485
00:36:46,213 --> 00:36:50,553
<i>into the death of a still unidentified
African-American suspect.</i>

486
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:54,130
<i>Those gathered here believe
the Philadelphia police are to blame.</i>

487
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:56,455
<i>Black so-called perpetrator.</i>

488
00:36:56,755 --> 00:36:58,045
<i>We got a white cop,</i>

489
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,210
<i>and based on his own admission,</i>

490
00:37:00,297 --> 00:37:01,627
<i>the woman was unarmed.</i>

491
00:37:02,172 --> 00:37:04,092
<i>Yet, he could not bring her in</i>

492
00:37:04,172 --> 00:37:06,132
<i>without throwing her in front of a train?</i>

493
00:37:06,213 --> 00:37:08,713
<i>They never identified the woman's body,</i>

494
00:37:08,797 --> 00:37:12,167
<i>and they never released a motive
for the homicide.</i>

495
00:37:12,255 --> 00:37:15,625
<i>And the icing on the cake
is the man got a promotion.</i>

496
00:37:15,713 --> 00:37:16,843
<i>A promotion?</i>

497
00:37:16,922 --> 00:37:18,802
<i>But Mayor Ed Rendell disagrees.</i>

498
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,380
<i>Whereas there's an unfortunate
divide in our community today,</i>

499
00:37:22,463 --> 00:37:24,923
<i>we also have to remember the victims
and their families.</i>

500
00:37:25,505 --> 00:37:27,125
<i>Because there are no easy answers here,</i>

501
00:37:27,213 --> 00:37:29,963
<i>just as there weren't
on that night nine years ago.</i>

502
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:31,957
- Daddy?
<i>- In terms of the traffic...</i>

503
00:37:32,047 --> 00:37:32,877
Yeah?

504
00:37:32,963 --> 00:37:33,963
What's that, baby?

505
00:37:34,547 --> 00:37:36,007
Your breakfast is melting.

506
00:37:38,755 --> 00:37:41,795
I thought we agreed
on no more ice cream for breakfast.

507
00:37:43,547 --> 00:37:44,837
Even on birthdays?

508
00:37:49,297 --> 00:37:52,377
You got me, honey. Why don't you put mine
in the fridge? Uh...

509
00:37:53,088 --> 00:37:54,258
I'm gonna be right out.

510
00:37:59,547 --> 00:38:02,207
Happy birthday, kiddo.

511
00:38:05,922 --> 00:38:06,922
Which hand?

512
00:38:07,713 --> 00:38:10,013
- That one!
- I don't know. Are you sure?

513
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:11,088
Yeah.

514
00:38:15,797 --> 00:38:16,797
Put it on.

515
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:20,962
Wow, we got so many places here.

516
00:38:21,047 --> 00:38:23,087
We've got this one, we've got that one.

517
00:38:23,172 --> 00:38:24,342
There we go.

518
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,842
- Well, what do you think?
- Well...

519
00:38:30,255 --> 00:38:32,955
- it's not as good as last year's.
- Oh.

520
00:38:34,005 --> 00:38:35,205
But...

521
00:38:35,297 --> 00:38:36,377
I'll take it.

522
00:38:41,922 --> 00:38:42,922
What?

523
00:38:45,255 --> 00:38:46,255
Nothing.

524
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,510
Happy birthday, honey.

525
00:38:49,297 --> 00:38:50,337
How's Maddox?

526
00:38:50,797 --> 00:38:51,797
Old...

527
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,380
and hungry.

528
00:38:54,172 --> 00:38:55,512
Bears love bunnies.

529
00:38:56,463 --> 00:38:57,963
Dad, we need to hurry up.

530
00:38:58,422 --> 00:39:00,382
I wanna get there right when it opens.

531
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,263
Honey, the bears
are gonna be there all day.

532
00:39:02,338 --> 00:39:04,878
Yeah, but brown bears are diurnal.

533
00:39:04,963 --> 00:39:07,203
So we have a better chance
of seeing them in the morning.

534
00:39:07,255 --> 00:39:08,255
Oh.

535
00:39:09,463 --> 00:39:11,923
Well, you know we gotta
do something first though, right?

536
00:39:12,963 --> 00:39:13,963
Mommy?

537
00:39:14,588 --> 00:39:15,668
That's right, Mommy.

538
00:39:17,463 --> 00:39:18,463
Eat up.

539
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:35,342
And these.

540
00:39:35,588 --> 00:39:36,708
And some of these.

541
00:39:36,797 --> 00:39:38,377
These are good.

542
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,130
And...

543
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,263
Whatever one you want.
Or do you want pink?

544
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:45,338
Maybe, yeah.

545
00:39:54,255 --> 00:39:55,585
Why are they so angry?

546
00:39:56,255 --> 00:39:59,005
Don't worry about them.
They're just celebrating your birthday.

547
00:39:59,547 --> 00:40:01,167
But they sound mad.

548
00:40:01,463 --> 00:40:04,463
Well, you know, some people
aren't happy unless they're mad.

549
00:40:05,297 --> 00:40:07,417
You'll see what I mean when you get older.

550
00:40:15,255 --> 00:40:16,255
Daddy?

551
00:40:18,922 --> 00:40:19,922
Daddy?

552
00:40:25,463 --> 00:40:26,513
Daddy, what's wrong?

553
00:40:27,422 --> 00:40:28,422
Nothing.

554
00:40:30,005 --> 00:40:31,005
Nothing's wrong.

555
00:40:40,588 --> 00:40:42,758
Megan's dad makes his own schedule.

556
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:44,338
Megan's dad ain't a detective.

557
00:40:44,422 --> 00:40:45,592
He's a doctor.

558
00:40:46,297 --> 00:40:48,587
So, we both save lives.

559
00:40:50,713 --> 00:40:52,133
It's true. Hey.

560
00:40:54,588 --> 00:40:56,508
Detective Lockhart, yes, hello.

561
00:40:57,172 --> 00:40:58,762
Slow down. Slow...

562
00:40:59,922 --> 00:41:01,922
What do you mean it's happening again?

563
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:06,338
Yeah.

564
00:41:07,297 --> 00:41:08,457
Yeah, I'll be right there.

565
00:41:22,338 --> 00:41:23,338
Sit right here.

566
00:41:25,797 --> 00:41:27,417
See the body yet? Back of the neck?

567
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,260
Good morning to you, too.
Somebody get a badge for their birthday?

568
00:41:31,338 --> 00:41:32,798
I got the call just now.

569
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,760
- She's eight.
- Nine.

570
00:41:36,213 --> 00:41:38,513
All right. Happy birthday, kiddo.

571
00:41:39,338 --> 00:41:40,458
Thank you, Maddox.

572
00:41:40,838 --> 00:41:42,298
It's fine. Don't worry, okay?

573
00:41:42,672 --> 00:41:43,672
Hey...

574
00:41:44,172 --> 00:41:46,052
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

575
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:49,667
No frowning.
We're still going to the zoo, baby.

576
00:41:50,005 --> 00:41:51,165
Give me a pinky swear.

577
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,420
I don't do pinky swears.

578
00:42:00,338 --> 00:42:01,338
Yates!

579
00:42:01,547 --> 00:42:03,707
Do me a solid.
Look after Amy for a second.

580
00:42:03,797 --> 00:42:05,587
- Uh...
- I appreciate it. Go.

581
00:42:06,005 --> 00:42:07,005
Hey, stay with her.

582
00:42:07,422 --> 00:42:09,842
- Have they been here all day?
- All day.

583
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:16,707
I don't think it's a good habit
to start bringing her to work every day.

584
00:42:16,797 --> 00:42:17,667
It's one time.

585
00:42:17,755 --> 00:42:18,755
It's a crime scene.

586
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:22,298
Yeah, calm down. She's in the car.
I won't have her inspecting the corpse.

587
00:42:24,172 --> 00:42:26,632
You didn't, uh,
put flowers on her grave, did you?

588
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,380
Say what now?

589
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:31,507
Jeanie. There were fresh flowers
on the grave this morning.

590
00:42:31,588 --> 00:42:32,628
No card, no note.

591
00:42:33,505 --> 00:42:34,505
No.

592
00:42:35,588 --> 00:42:36,588
All right.

593
00:43:01,755 --> 00:43:03,005
Nine years, huh?

594
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,510
Political copycats?

595
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,260
Where would they get the poison?

596
00:43:15,672 --> 00:43:17,762
Labbies could never reverse-engineer this.

597
00:43:21,172 --> 00:43:23,092
Well, well well, now it's a party.

598
00:43:23,172 --> 00:43:24,762
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.

599
00:43:27,088 --> 00:43:28,708
How's the birthday girl?

600
00:43:29,588 --> 00:43:31,298
Ooh, she's a whole year older.

601
00:43:34,297 --> 00:43:35,297
Hey, uh...

602
00:43:36,422 --> 00:43:39,092
You didn't go by Jeanie's grave, did you?

603
00:43:40,422 --> 00:43:42,302
Uh... not yet. Why?

604
00:43:43,588 --> 00:43:44,588
Josiah Warren.

605
00:43:46,672 --> 00:43:48,382
- Who's that?
- Rings a bell. Uh...

606
00:43:48,463 --> 00:43:51,513
It's an anarchist.
One of those Ruby Ridge types.

607
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:56,010
Look at us, right back in it, all this
Market Street shit all over again.

608
00:43:56,797 --> 00:43:58,127
Lieutenant Holt?

609
00:43:59,547 --> 00:44:00,757
You guys gotta see this.

610
00:44:02,422 --> 00:44:05,592
- Hey, man, I'll take it from here.
- All right, let's see it. What do you got?

611
00:44:20,463 --> 00:44:21,593
Shit.

612
00:44:22,463 --> 00:44:23,673
Damn good copycat.

613
00:44:23,755 --> 00:44:26,755
We let these insane protesters
take it up a notch every year.

614
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:29,258
- This is what we get.
- Well, up a notch to murder.

615
00:44:29,338 --> 00:44:32,958
It only takes one deranged enough
to dress like her and kill like her.

616
00:44:33,047 --> 00:44:35,047
- Really?
- If it's not one of them, who is it?

617
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,050
I mean, come on,
you're the brilliant detectives.

618
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:38,510
You got any ideas?

619
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:43,510
- None of it makes any sense.
- Has anybody else seen this?

620
00:44:44,088 --> 00:44:47,008
- Not so far in security.
- Good, let's keep it that way.

621
00:44:47,088 --> 00:44:48,878
No news, no talking to reporters.

622
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:52,128
Protesters are just looking
for a reason to riot.

623
00:44:52,213 --> 00:44:53,843
That's not your call, Detective.

624
00:45:41,422 --> 00:45:42,422
Lock?

625
00:45:46,297 --> 00:45:47,297
You good, man?

626
00:45:51,338 --> 00:45:52,458
Nine years, huh?

627
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:57,758
You know, there was something
I never told you about that night,

628
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:58,838
down in the subway.

629
00:46:00,963 --> 00:46:02,173
She told me things.

630
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,210
She knew about Amy.

631
00:46:05,797 --> 00:46:07,707
Things she shouldn't
have been able to know.

632
00:46:08,588 --> 00:46:09,958
What are you talking about?

633
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:12,588
She said we'd see each other again.

634
00:46:14,755 --> 00:46:16,835
After she died, there were no more bodies.

635
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:18,800
We stopped looking.

636
00:46:19,297 --> 00:46:21,797
We never put together
any of the pieces because, hey,

637
00:46:22,255 --> 00:46:23,585
case closed, right?

638
00:46:23,672 --> 00:46:26,092
Well, yeah. I mean, shit.

639
00:46:29,047 --> 00:46:31,547
I think it's time we put together
some of the pieces.

640
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:37,010
Hey, hey, find out anything you can
about these keys.

641
00:46:37,088 --> 00:46:38,378
- Eighty-eight?
- Yeah.

642
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:39,463
You got it.

643
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:42,173
- Your dad putting you to work, Amy?
<i>- </i>She's got a point.

644
00:46:42,255 --> 00:46:43,255
<i>Breaking news.</i>

645
00:46:43,338 --> 00:46:46,178
<i>We are going to go live with a briefing
about the Market Street murders.</i>

646
00:46:46,213 --> 00:46:47,093
Uncle Brian!

647
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:49,572
<i>We have reason to believe
she's still currently in the city.</i>

648
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:50,630
No, don't show her.

649
00:46:50,672 --> 00:46:53,512
<i>- Our suspect is wanted in connection...</i>
- Don't... don't show her.

650
00:46:53,588 --> 00:46:55,708
<i>With the Market Street murders of 1988.</i>

651
00:46:55,797 --> 00:46:57,087
Damn it! Motherfucker!

652
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:58,460
Language.

653
00:46:58,547 --> 00:47:01,607
- Yeah, he's your uncle. Great job.
<i>- It is believed she may be connected to...</i>

654
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:04,840
<i>at least two homicides
in the last 24 hours.</i>

655
00:47:06,088 --> 00:47:08,008
<i>She is priority number one</i>

656
00:47:08,338 --> 00:47:11,298
for all law enforcement agencies
in Philadelphia.

657
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,380
- Get me, uh...
- Philly PD tip line....

658
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:15,763
<i>At the present moment,
she is considered to be armed</i>

659
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:16,958
<i>and extremely dangerous.</i>

660
00:47:17,047 --> 00:47:19,127
Yes, we are aware
the killer is a woman.

661
00:47:19,213 --> 00:47:22,463
<i>Now to the good people
of Philadelphia, let me assure you...</i>

662
00:47:22,922 --> 00:47:24,172
that apprehending this woman...

663
00:47:25,797 --> 00:47:28,917
<i>is our department's
primary objective.</i>

664
00:47:29,588 --> 00:47:30,918
<i>But we need your help.</i>

665
00:47:32,338 --> 00:47:35,838
<i>If you or anyone you know
has any information on his woman...</i>

666
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,630
<i>or if you've seen anyone
who matches her description...</i>

667
00:47:40,338 --> 00:47:41,758
<i>do not engage,</i>

668
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,340
<i>but call our tip line.</i>

669
00:47:45,797 --> 00:47:48,007
<i>Officers are standing by to hear you.</i>

670
00:47:49,338 --> 00:47:50,588
<i>Working together,</i>

671
00:47:51,088 --> 00:47:52,918
<i>we can apprehend a vicious criminal.</i>

672
00:47:54,713 --> 00:47:55,713
<i>Thank you.</i>

673
00:47:56,297 --> 00:47:57,707
And stay safe, Philadelphia.

674
00:47:58,547 --> 00:47:59,957
- Questions?
- Lieutenant Holt...

675
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:14,560
We couldn't find anything these fuckers
had in common when there was four of 'em.

676
00:48:14,588 --> 00:48:16,258
Adding folks doesn't make it any easier.

677
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,880
Yeah.

678
00:48:19,547 --> 00:48:21,297
These two were both left-handed.

679
00:48:23,713 --> 00:48:26,173
These two both voted for Perot.

680
00:48:26,422 --> 00:48:27,422
Shit.

681
00:48:29,755 --> 00:48:32,165
These two have nothing in common,

682
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,625
except for the fact
that both their blood is red.

683
00:48:34,713 --> 00:48:36,633
No. It's her hand.

684
00:48:39,088 --> 00:48:40,088
It's her hand.

685
00:48:40,922 --> 00:48:41,922
What about it?

686
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:45,918
We never told anybody
about her hand injury.

687
00:48:46,005 --> 00:48:47,835
We didn't release that to the press.

688
00:48:49,047 --> 00:48:51,457
How in the hell a copycat
gonna know that detail?

689
00:48:54,547 --> 00:48:56,007
It's nine years ago, brother.

690
00:48:56,338 --> 00:48:57,338
Shit gets leaked.

691
00:49:00,255 --> 00:49:02,045
What, you think she didn't actually die?

692
00:49:04,172 --> 00:49:05,422
Is that what you're saying?

693
00:49:08,213 --> 00:49:10,213
Please tell me
that's not what you're saying.

694
00:49:11,755 --> 00:49:13,415
Key is to a Falcon 160.

695
00:49:13,755 --> 00:49:15,205
Fairly common on small airfields.

696
00:49:15,297 --> 00:49:17,957
Unfortunately, there's no way
to match up the key

697
00:49:18,047 --> 00:49:19,417
to a specific plane.

698
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:20,838
Now, hold on now.

699
00:49:21,213 --> 00:49:25,303
It says that this plane
was manufactured in 1996.

700
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:27,382
Yeah, the model came out last year.

701
00:49:28,213 --> 00:49:29,213
Last year?

702
00:49:29,755 --> 00:49:32,085
How in the hell
did she have these keys in '88?

703
00:49:33,797 --> 00:49:34,797
Prototype.

704
00:49:35,755 --> 00:49:36,955
Eight years before?

705
00:49:38,088 --> 00:49:41,708
I made some calls. A hundred-mile radius,
there's only one airfield with this model.

706
00:49:46,755 --> 00:49:47,755
Yo, man.

707
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:55,552
Uh, hey, why don't you do me a favor
and look after her until I'm back, okay?

708
00:49:59,047 --> 00:50:01,207
Hey, hey, hey.

709
00:50:01,297 --> 00:50:02,297
How you doing?

710
00:50:02,713 --> 00:50:03,713
Hey.

711
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:06,168
I've gotta work
a little bit longer, all right?

712
00:50:06,505 --> 00:50:09,875
But Miss Tabitha right there, she's gonna
look after you till I get back.

713
00:50:09,963 --> 00:50:10,963
Okay?

714
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:12,420
It's dark.

715
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,420
The zoo's closed.

716
00:50:14,755 --> 00:50:15,795
Baby, I know.

717
00:50:16,672 --> 00:50:19,152
I'm gonna make it up to you tomorrow
when we go in the morning,

718
00:50:19,213 --> 00:50:21,303
'cause that's when
they're gonna be out, right?

719
00:50:21,547 --> 00:50:22,957
They're diurnal, remember?

720
00:50:24,088 --> 00:50:25,088
Mmm.

721
00:50:27,255 --> 00:50:28,255
I'll see you later.

722
00:50:29,422 --> 00:50:30,422
Let's go.

723
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:35,550
I almost forgot. A Dr. Naveen Rao called
for you three times on the tip line.

724
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,310
They wanna talk to me, they gotta come in.

725
00:50:37,338 --> 00:50:38,628
Yeah, that's what I told him.

726
00:50:38,713 --> 00:50:39,923
Detective Lockhart, excuse me.

727
00:50:40,713 --> 00:50:43,013
Detective Lockhart,
I've been waiting for over an hour.

728
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,800
Hi, my name is Naveen Rao.
I'm a senior physicist at...

729
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,170
- You have from here to the door.
- I know you've got a lot on your plate.

730
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,935
I know what I'm going to say
will sound more like fiction than fact.

731
00:50:52,963 --> 00:50:54,803
The door is pretty close, by the way.

732
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,090
I believe your case intersects
with my work in a significant way.

733
00:50:58,172 --> 00:51:01,632
Both appearances of the murderer have
happened during a specific lunar perigee.

734
00:51:01,713 --> 00:51:03,303
In this case, nine years apart.

735
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,630
What you may know
simply as a super moon or a blood moon

736
00:51:05,713 --> 00:51:08,013
are actually events
of great scientific significance.

737
00:51:08,088 --> 00:51:08,918
Fascinating.

738
00:51:09,005 --> 00:51:11,055
When the lunar cycle
reaches exactly the right point,

739
00:51:11,088 --> 00:51:14,588
its gravitational forces react
with electromagnetic pockets and...

740
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:16,212
Hey, whoa!

741
00:51:16,963 --> 00:51:20,013
Theoretically creates a kind of bridge.

742
00:51:22,463 --> 00:51:23,963
Yeah, bridge to where?

743
00:51:24,505 --> 00:51:26,125
Another place entirely.

744
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,170
My advice:

745
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,760
take it to Channel Five.

746
00:51:34,338 --> 00:51:35,668
They'll eat this shit up.

747
00:52:25,963 --> 00:52:28,093
Well, it's locked.

748
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:31,010
Time to call it a night. Let's go home.

749
00:52:34,838 --> 00:52:36,798
Oh, you see that? Someone's here.

750
00:52:38,463 --> 00:52:39,513
We gotta go in.

751
00:52:41,297 --> 00:52:42,797
Don't do this, man, not like this.

752
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,050
Hey, you got a better idea, I'm all ears.

753
00:52:47,213 --> 00:52:48,303
You've got that look.

754
00:52:49,088 --> 00:52:51,588
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know.

755
00:52:51,672 --> 00:52:52,672
No, I don't know.

756
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:55,850
Don't use this
as some kind of fucked-up way

757
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:57,922
of dealing with what happened
to Jeanie.

758
00:53:01,088 --> 00:53:02,088
Lock.

759
00:53:02,297 --> 00:53:03,587
Leave it alone.

760
00:53:03,672 --> 00:53:04,672
Don't...

761
00:53:06,922 --> 00:53:07,922
Lock.

762
00:53:11,255 --> 00:53:12,255
Lock!

763
00:53:21,422 --> 00:53:22,512
Hey, how'd you get in here?

764
00:53:22,588 --> 00:53:25,298
Hey. Detective Lockhart. Uh, Philly PD.

765
00:53:27,297 --> 00:53:28,297
You, uh...

766
00:53:30,755 --> 00:53:31,955
seen this woman?

767
00:53:33,088 --> 00:53:34,208
Can't say that I have.

768
00:53:43,422 --> 00:53:45,302
- Everything all right tonight?
- Yeah.

769
00:53:46,005 --> 00:53:47,455
Yeah, everything's fine. Why?

770
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:52,130
No, just...

771
00:53:53,005 --> 00:53:54,295
you're here kind of late.

772
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:55,380
Yeah, I had a...

773
00:53:55,755 --> 00:53:57,085
I had a guy call in and cancel.

774
00:53:57,172 --> 00:53:59,462
But, you know,
still gotta do the paperwork, right?

775
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:02,208
Never enough paperwork.

776
00:54:02,922 --> 00:54:04,712
No. No, there never is.

777
00:54:06,672 --> 00:54:07,672
Ah...

778
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:11,630
Well, okay.

779
00:54:12,672 --> 00:54:13,672
Ah...

780
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,340
Well, you know, let me give you my number.

781
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,005
In case anything...

782
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:22,170
you know, comes to mind.

783
00:54:31,463 --> 00:54:32,593
Yeah.

784
00:54:32,672 --> 00:54:33,922
Thanks. Yeah.

785
00:54:34,005 --> 00:54:35,795
Thanks. Maybe I will.

786
00:54:37,963 --> 00:54:40,013
All right. Oh, uh, you know,
before I forget...

787
00:54:41,088 --> 00:54:41,958
uh,

788
00:54:42,047 --> 00:54:44,957
what's the best way to get back
to the turnpike from here?

789
00:54:46,255 --> 00:54:47,585
Could you draw me a map?

790
00:54:50,005 --> 00:54:51,005
Sure.

791
00:54:55,088 --> 00:54:56,298
It's, uh...

792
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:00,588
It's that way.

793
00:55:02,047 --> 00:55:03,047
Appreciate that.

794
00:55:09,297 --> 00:55:10,297
Hey, Tom.

795
00:55:13,047 --> 00:55:14,257
Nice to see you again.

796
00:55:15,505 --> 00:55:17,125
Holy shit, it is you.

797
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:18,213
Gun on the floor.

798
00:55:18,713 --> 00:55:19,713
Yeah.

799
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:26,982
If you were a better shot, I'd be dead.

800
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:30,420
Now, sit down.

801
00:55:31,088 --> 00:55:32,258
- Sit!
- Yeah.

802
00:55:36,588 --> 00:55:37,708
Tape his wrists.

803
00:55:38,172 --> 00:55:40,172
- Tape his wrists!
- Okay, okay.

804
00:55:40,255 --> 00:55:41,835
- Let's go! Move it!
- Easy.

805
00:55:44,505 --> 00:55:46,625
Just stay calm. Relax.

806
00:55:50,838 --> 00:55:52,418
- Faster.
- I'm trying.

807
00:55:58,797 --> 00:55:59,797
Lock.

808
00:56:00,422 --> 00:56:02,262
Hello? Hello?

809
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:05,458
- Okay.
- You.

810
00:56:05,922 --> 00:56:07,592
Get me the key to that plane outside.

811
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,960
- Okay.
- Move!

812
00:56:10,755 --> 00:56:11,915
I saw you die.

813
00:56:13,005 --> 00:56:14,335
Yeah, you did.

814
00:56:16,922 --> 00:56:18,512
- Here it is.
- Toss me the keys.

815
00:56:18,588 --> 00:56:21,088
Yeah. It's one... it's one lock 206.

816
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:33,258
Stay down! You too!

817
00:56:33,338 --> 00:56:34,418
All right, all right.

818
00:56:34,505 --> 00:56:36,205
Shit.

819
00:56:44,672 --> 00:56:46,052
Now you're coming with me.

820
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:50,005
- Yeah, yeah.
- Nose on the floor!

821
00:56:54,088 --> 00:56:55,008
Move it!

822
00:56:55,088 --> 00:56:56,548
I'm running out of time!

823
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:57,630
Freeze, bitch!

824
00:57:04,047 --> 00:57:05,547
- No.
- Maddox?

825
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:27,630
Lock?

826
00:57:27,713 --> 00:57:28,843
Hey! Don't shoot!

827
00:57:29,588 --> 00:57:31,008
Don't shoot! Nobody shoot!

828
00:57:31,422 --> 00:57:32,422
Don't risk it!

829
00:57:34,255 --> 00:57:36,375
Somebody give me
some fuckin' bolt cutters!

830
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:38,958
Fuck me.

831
00:58:24,922 --> 00:58:25,922
Tom?

832
00:58:26,588 --> 00:58:27,588
Thomas?

833
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:29,255
Hey.

834
00:58:31,172 --> 00:58:32,172
Listen.

835
00:58:33,422 --> 00:58:35,132
You have to stop chasing me.

836
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:37,760
I'm doing all this for a reason.

837
00:58:38,838 --> 00:58:40,378
I'm saving people's lives.

838
00:58:43,505 --> 00:58:44,705
You murdered my partner.

839
00:58:44,797 --> 00:58:46,587
That was never part of the plan.

840
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:52,460
How the hell are you alive?

841
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:56,420
Every nine years...

842
00:58:57,463 --> 00:58:58,803
when the moon sets,

843
00:58:59,255 --> 00:59:00,255
I can come back.

844
00:59:00,797 --> 00:59:01,877
But not for long.

845
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,380
The moon?

846
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:08,338
What do you mean come back? Huh?

847
00:59:08,422 --> 00:59:11,512
The more I tell you,
the more you'll keep coming after me.

848
00:59:11,797 --> 00:59:13,957
And I've seen how that turns out for you.

849
00:59:15,755 --> 00:59:17,545
You can choose to stop.

850
00:59:18,172 --> 00:59:19,302
Go home to your daughter.

851
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:22,510
Pretend none of this ever happened.

852
00:59:23,713 --> 00:59:25,013
Yeah, can't do that.

853
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,130
Hey.

854
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:30,380
- I don't have any more time.
- What are you doing? Whoa!

855
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:39,260
What the fuck were you thinking?

856
01:01:41,755 --> 01:01:44,335
There's a dozen different ways
you could have died.

857
01:01:46,255 --> 01:01:47,755
Goddammit.

858
01:01:50,088 --> 01:01:51,088
Look...

859
01:01:53,047 --> 01:01:54,297
- Hey.
- I'm sorry...

860
01:01:55,255 --> 01:01:56,295
about Maddox.

861
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:57,588
Sir.

862
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:01,170
We'll continue searching the area,
but so far, there's still no sign of her.

863
01:02:01,922 --> 01:02:02,922
Well, keep looking.

864
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:07,045
You won't find anything.

865
01:02:09,588 --> 01:02:10,628
She's gone, Holt.

866
01:02:12,005 --> 01:02:13,205
Just like the last time.

867
01:02:15,588 --> 01:02:17,048
What's that supposed to mean?

868
01:02:19,088 --> 01:02:20,338
She's gone back.

869
01:02:23,213 --> 01:02:24,213
Where?

870
01:02:25,255 --> 01:02:26,255
The future.

871
01:02:28,922 --> 01:02:30,762
She's from the future.

872
01:02:46,838 --> 01:02:48,668
<i>âª Why does the sun</i> âª

873
01:02:49,963 --> 01:02:52,883
<i>âª Go on shining? âª</i>

874
01:02:54,338 --> 01:03:00,008
<i>âª Why does the sea rush to shore? âª</i>

875
01:03:01,797 --> 01:03:04,957
<i>âª Don't they know âª</i>

876
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:08,797
<i>âª It's the end of the world? âª</i>

877
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:15,300
<i>âª 'Cause you don't love me any more âª</i>

878
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:22,665
<i>âª Why do the birds go on singing? âª</i>

879
01:03:29,922 --> 01:03:30,922
Oh, man.

880
01:03:32,172 --> 01:03:35,262
<i>âª Don't they know âª</i>

881
01:03:35,338 --> 01:03:38,668
<i>âª It's the end of the world? âª</i>

882
01:03:40,588 --> 01:03:42,258
Ah.

883
01:03:43,172 --> 01:03:44,512
Hello, Harold.

884
01:04:04,505 --> 01:04:06,665
<i>Philadelphia,
their whole, white uniforms,</i>

885
01:04:06,755 --> 01:04:08,975
<i>Iverson going left to right,
looking to add to the lead.</i>

886
01:04:09,005 --> 01:04:10,875
<i>Oh! A wicked crossover by Allen.</i>

887
01:04:10,963 --> 01:04:13,803
<i>Spins into the paint,
hits it out to Chris Webber.</i>

888
01:04:14,213 --> 01:04:16,673
<i>C. Webb knocks down the J
with a right elbow.</i>

889
01:04:17,005 --> 01:04:19,835
<i>Natural speed now,
smooth and tight in the mid-range.</i>

890
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:22,882
<i>He and A.I. continue to build
a great chemistry together.</i>

891
01:04:23,088 --> 01:04:26,298
<i>Philadelphia leads by four, 37-33.</i>

892
01:04:26,547 --> 01:04:27,627
<i>Take a break here...</i>

893
01:04:38,422 --> 01:04:39,512
Tomorrow, buddy.

894
01:04:42,755 --> 01:04:44,125
This time we're gonna get her.

895
01:04:45,588 --> 01:04:47,838
<i>Mr. Lockhart,
in answer to your numerous inquiries,</i>

896
01:04:47,922 --> 01:04:51,262
<i>Dr. Rao has been working
in the private sector for the past decade.</i>

897
01:04:51,338 --> 01:04:54,008
<i>And he has had no recent contact
with this office.</i>

898
01:04:54,338 --> 01:04:58,128
<i>And even if he did, policy prevents me
from giving out information</i>

899
01:04:58,213 --> 01:05:00,713
<i>- of any employee or previous...</i>

900
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:04,835
Hang on.

901
01:06:06,297 --> 01:06:08,007
- What?
- Mrs. Nowak?

902
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:09,510
Yeah.

903
01:06:09,588 --> 01:06:12,008
Thomas Lockhart. I'm...
I'm a private investigator.

904
01:06:12,088 --> 01:06:15,338
Wonder if I could just ask you
a few questions about your husband.

905
01:06:16,838 --> 01:06:18,128
Harold's dead.

906
01:06:18,838 --> 01:06:20,798
I'm aware of that. Um...

907
01:06:21,297 --> 01:06:22,297
I'm...

908
01:06:22,547 --> 01:06:25,207
gathering information
on local drug overdose cases.

909
01:06:25,297 --> 01:06:27,297
Where were you 18 years ago?

910
01:06:29,672 --> 01:06:30,672
May I come in?

911
01:06:34,963 --> 01:06:36,553
Don't let the cat out.

912
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,760
I went away to see my sister
for a week or so.

913
01:06:53,213 --> 01:06:54,303
Came back...

914
01:06:55,005 --> 01:06:56,255
found Harold...

915
01:06:56,922 --> 01:06:58,052
on the floor.

916
01:06:58,963 --> 01:07:00,923
Cracked his head open
on the desk when he fell.

917
01:07:03,213 --> 01:07:04,343
Blood...

918
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:05,920
everywhere.

919
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,760
All turned black.

920
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:14,510
Still got one of them flags in here.

921
01:07:25,797 --> 01:07:28,297
Your husband, he, um... wrote these?

922
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:30,670
Those and a lot more.

923
01:07:31,338 --> 01:07:33,298
Sent them all over the country

924
01:07:33,672 --> 01:07:35,302
hidden in these books.

925
01:07:37,755 --> 01:07:41,085
Let people have some privacy
about their ideas.

926
01:07:43,088 --> 01:07:45,298
Had quite a following.

927
01:07:48,963 --> 01:07:51,173
The movement was his thing.

928
01:07:52,922 --> 01:07:53,922
Were you into it?

929
01:07:56,422 --> 01:07:58,882
I was young and he a good dope.

930
01:08:00,047 --> 01:08:01,957
But he took it pretty serious.

931
01:08:03,255 --> 01:08:04,255
How serious?

932
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,460
Enough to freak me out.

933
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:15,048
You don't know, um,
who he mailed all these to, do you?

934
01:08:19,422 --> 01:08:20,422
Give me a minute.

935
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:32,630
Who's the girl?

936
01:08:33,505 --> 01:08:35,045
Heather Russell, Harold's ex.

937
01:08:36,463 --> 01:08:38,383
You heard of drinking the Kool-Aid?

938
01:08:38,463 --> 01:08:40,463
She fuckin' made the Kool-Aid.

939
01:08:43,047 --> 01:08:45,127
So they were working on this together?

940
01:08:45,213 --> 01:08:47,593
Until they split, crazy bitch.

941
01:08:48,505 --> 01:08:49,625
You know where she's at now?

942
01:08:50,213 --> 01:08:53,463
You keep track of the people
that fucked your wife before you did?

943
01:08:57,505 --> 01:08:58,505
Here you go.

944
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:00,550
Mailing list.

945
01:09:03,713 --> 01:09:05,553
Seems pretty important to you.

946
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:10,880
Suppose it is.

947
01:09:11,797 --> 01:09:13,007
Then I'd say...

948
01:09:14,255 --> 01:09:16,545
I've been pretty generous with my time.

949
01:09:18,047 --> 01:09:20,257
Lots of other things
a girl could be doing.

950
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:23,380
Hmm.

951
01:09:25,588 --> 01:09:28,548
Well, what do you propose, Arleen?

952
01:09:30,713 --> 01:09:32,093
How much you got on you?

953
01:09:49,005 --> 01:09:50,545
Asherdowns.

954
01:09:56,422 --> 01:09:57,632
Asherdowns.

955
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:09,710
Holy shit.

956
01:10:16,588 --> 01:10:18,168
<i>You've reached Captain Brian Holt.</i>

957
01:10:18,255 --> 01:10:19,605
- Come on.
<i>- Please leave a message.</i>

958
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:21,800
<i>I'll get back to you soon as possible.</i>

959
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:22,960
Hey, it's me.

960
01:10:23,588 --> 01:10:24,708
We gotta meet tonight.

961
01:10:25,005 --> 01:10:26,205
Think I found something.

962
01:10:27,047 --> 01:10:28,377
Might be a big something.

963
01:10:29,172 --> 01:10:31,262
And if it's, uh, not too big of a...
of an ask,

964
01:10:31,338 --> 01:10:34,208
I need you to run a current address
on a Heather Russell.

965
01:10:35,172 --> 01:10:36,172
Call me.

966
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:37,380
Bye.

967
01:10:51,297 --> 01:10:52,297
Hey, kiddo!

968
01:10:55,797 --> 01:10:56,957
I'm sorry I'm late.

969
01:10:57,797 --> 01:10:58,957
Got caught up.

970
01:11:01,297 --> 01:11:03,667
That beard's ridiculous.
You look like a homeless person.

971
01:11:04,713 --> 01:11:06,303
And it's good to see you.

972
01:11:11,755 --> 01:11:12,875
Got time for a...

973
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:15,590
late lunch or dinner?

974
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:18,960
Can't. Aunt Maggie's taking me
to King of Prussia.

975
01:11:20,172 --> 01:11:22,382
I could've taken you
to King of Prussia, too, you know?

976
01:11:22,463 --> 01:11:25,013
It's a girl's thing we're doing.
Not really your scene.

977
01:11:25,088 --> 01:11:26,418
Oh, okay.

978
01:11:33,672 --> 01:11:34,672
How's school?

979
01:11:35,047 --> 01:11:37,887
Guidance counselor thinks I have
a good shot at the scholarship to Penn.

980
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:42,508
Thought you wanted to go out of state.

981
01:11:42,922 --> 01:11:44,842
George is gonna stay around here, so...

982
01:11:45,463 --> 01:11:47,303
- Oh, what, the football guy?
- Yep.

983
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:48,380
Ah.

984
01:11:48,755 --> 01:11:50,665
Right, you told me about him before.

985
01:11:51,463 --> 01:11:52,463
You've met him,

986
01:11:52,797 --> 01:11:53,877
like, twice.

987
01:11:56,463 --> 01:11:57,673
Yeah, nice guy.

988
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,877
How's staying with Holt working out?

989
01:12:04,297 --> 01:12:05,297
Good.

990
01:12:06,338 --> 01:12:07,758
Closer to school, so...

991
01:12:09,797 --> 01:12:10,707
Good, I'm glad.

992
01:12:10,797 --> 01:12:11,917
It's for the best.

993
01:12:12,005 --> 01:12:14,505
I mean, for now, you know, honey.
I mean, it's just temporary.

994
01:12:14,838 --> 01:12:16,878
I'll be back on track soon enough.

995
01:12:24,338 --> 01:12:25,798
Seriously, Dad, still?

996
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,880
Uh, you know, somebody's gotta find him.

997
01:12:30,547 --> 01:12:32,207
Yeah, I gotta work.

998
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,300
I'm close this time, Ames.

999
01:12:37,588 --> 01:12:38,588
Real close.

1000
01:12:40,463 --> 01:12:41,463
You'll see.

1001
01:12:49,255 --> 01:12:50,835
Ah, bada-bing, bada-boom!

1002
01:12:50,922 --> 01:12:51,922
Here we go.

1003
01:12:55,172 --> 01:12:57,672
Why do you still have a scanner?
You're not a cop anymore.

1004
01:12:59,338 --> 01:13:01,258
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.

1005
01:13:02,338 --> 01:13:03,838
Almost forgot the whole thing.

1006
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:05,875
Happy birthday, kiddo.

1007
01:13:15,672 --> 01:13:16,672
For your bracelet.

1008
01:13:22,213 --> 01:13:24,213
Dad, I haven't worn that thing in years.

1009
01:13:27,297 --> 01:13:28,297
Oh.

1010
01:13:32,547 --> 01:13:34,127
Well, I kept the receipt, so...

1011
01:13:35,922 --> 01:13:36,922
Thanks for trying.

1012
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:48,957
Look, Ames, I know how things have been.

1013
01:13:51,005 --> 01:13:52,005
I get it.

1014
01:13:53,797 --> 01:13:55,837
I'm not Mr. Ideal Dad or whatever.

1015
01:13:58,713 --> 01:14:00,763
But I'm gonna finish this thing soon.

1016
01:14:03,088 --> 01:14:06,208
I promise you,
and then we're gonna get back to normal.

1017
01:14:06,588 --> 01:14:08,588
Just me and you, just like old times.

1018
01:14:08,963 --> 01:14:11,053
Dad, that's not how things work.
You can't just...

1019
01:14:16,172 --> 01:14:17,422
You gotta let it go.

1020
01:14:20,672 --> 01:14:21,672
And seriously,

1021
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:22,880
lose the beard.

1022
01:14:23,838 --> 01:14:24,838
Right.

1023
01:14:25,172 --> 01:14:26,172
Hey...

1024
01:14:26,505 --> 01:14:27,585
Uncle Brian home?

1025
01:14:28,088 --> 01:14:29,088
Bye, Dad.

1026
01:14:29,463 --> 01:14:30,593
You have him call me!

1027
01:15:14,463 --> 01:15:15,463
Hey.

1028
01:15:21,172 --> 01:15:22,262
You got that address?

1029
01:15:22,422 --> 01:15:23,552
Heather Russell?

1030
01:15:25,922 --> 01:15:27,552
Yeah, that's why you're here, right?

1031
01:15:28,255 --> 01:15:30,335
Look, for Jane and for Amy's sake,

1032
01:15:30,422 --> 01:15:31,552
I've been patient.

1033
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:33,510
Hey, hey, we missed one of our victims.

1034
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:37,510
Harold Nowak.

1035
01:15:38,838 --> 01:15:40,878
Just outside our jurisdiction, so...

1036
01:15:41,297 --> 01:15:44,507
Local boys wrote it off as a drug overdose
so we never caught it.

1037
01:15:48,588 --> 01:15:49,668
How'd you get that?

1038
01:15:50,172 --> 01:15:51,302
He was a nut.

1039
01:15:52,255 --> 01:15:53,545
Had a fringe militia club.

1040
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:54,760
The Real American Movement.

1041
01:15:54,838 --> 01:15:57,008
Wanted to take the country back
for the true patriots.

1042
01:15:57,088 --> 01:15:59,918
You know, homemade fertilizer bombs.
You know the type.

1043
01:16:02,713 --> 01:16:04,013
And I got his mailing list.

1044
01:16:06,422 --> 01:16:08,882
Two of the four victims from '97
were on it.

1045
01:16:08,963 --> 01:16:11,423
All of 'em from '88,
that's the connection.

1046
01:16:12,338 --> 01:16:14,018
They're all part of this radical movement.

1047
01:16:14,088 --> 01:16:16,008
- Tom.
- They were up to something big.

1048
01:16:16,588 --> 01:16:18,838
And I'm thinking that isotope
that she injects them with

1049
01:16:18,922 --> 01:16:21,462
is some high-tech way
of killing people remotely.

1050
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,920
And it's triggered
from the future, maybe. I...

1051
01:16:24,005 --> 01:16:25,045
I don't know. I don't...

1052
01:16:25,130 --> 01:16:27,090
I don't entirely
have that pinned down yet.

1053
01:16:27,172 --> 01:16:29,512
- Tom...
- You remember Naveen Rao

1054
01:16:29,588 --> 01:16:31,548
and his theory
about the lunar cycle bridge thing?

1055
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:32,760
Jesus, Tom.

1056
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:34,592
Had to do with the moon.

1057
01:16:36,172 --> 01:16:37,172
You need help.

1058
01:16:42,088 --> 01:16:43,088
You don't get it.

1059
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:47,630
She gets torn apart by a train
and nine years later she's back,

1060
01:16:47,713 --> 01:16:48,883
alive and killing.

1061
01:16:53,797 --> 01:16:54,797
Listen.

1062
01:16:58,297 --> 01:16:59,667
We're all going forward.

1063
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:01,880
But her...

1064
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:03,510
She's going backward.

1065
01:17:04,088 --> 01:17:05,668
Decade by decade.

1066
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:07,840
So that shit in '97...

1067
01:17:08,547 --> 01:17:09,797
she didn't come back to life.

1068
01:17:11,755 --> 01:17:13,665
She just wasn't dead yet.

1069
01:17:13,755 --> 01:17:15,005
You sound insane.

1070
01:17:15,547 --> 01:17:19,337
Okay? You sound like a fuckin'
insane person right now. You need help.

1071
01:17:21,088 --> 01:17:22,758
She knew things about me, Holt.

1072
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:26,210
She knew things about Jeanie,

1073
01:17:26,588 --> 01:17:27,588
and Amy.

1074
01:17:28,422 --> 01:17:29,922
Things that she couldn't know.

1075
01:17:30,422 --> 01:17:31,962
And she killed Maddox.

1076
01:17:33,672 --> 01:17:35,132
She's coming back again...

1077
01:17:36,088 --> 01:17:37,088
and it's today.

1078
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:41,130
Do you...?

1079
01:17:42,338 --> 01:17:44,018
Have you completely lost
your fuckin' mind?

1080
01:17:44,088 --> 01:17:47,878
You're talking about a case...
that's been cold for a fuckin' decade.

1081
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:51,133
You know how many murders
I've had in the past week?

1082
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,210
I'm raising your own daughter,
for Christ sake,

1083
01:17:54,297 --> 01:17:57,047
and you're coming to me
with fucking time travel?

1084
01:18:00,422 --> 01:18:02,172
Are you even listening to yourself?

1085
01:18:08,463 --> 01:18:09,513
You're all I got.

1086
01:18:10,755 --> 01:18:12,755
I couldn't stop what happened to Jeanie.

1087
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:14,375
But I can stop her.

1088
01:18:15,463 --> 01:18:17,763
This is Harold Nowak's wife.

1089
01:18:18,672 --> 01:18:20,592
This is his muse.

1090
01:18:22,547 --> 01:18:24,257
All I want is her address.

1091
01:18:24,547 --> 01:18:27,047
And I won't ask you for nothing
ever again.

1092
01:18:27,922 --> 01:18:28,922
I promise.

1093
01:18:29,922 --> 01:18:30,922
Please.

1094
01:18:35,922 --> 01:18:38,592
You're chasing moonbeams
while your own life got away.

1095
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,760
It's just fucking sad to watch.

1096
01:18:42,838 --> 01:18:44,838
It's sad that Amy has to watch it.

1097
01:18:53,297 --> 01:18:54,297
Is it worth it?

1098
01:19:12,797 --> 01:19:13,797
Maybe you're right.

1099
01:19:17,505 --> 01:19:18,505
Maybe I...

1100
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:20,170
maybe I need help.

1101
01:19:25,213 --> 01:19:26,883
I'm sorry for all the shit, man.

1102
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:31,463
And I'm sorry
for you taking care of Amy and, uh...

1103
01:19:37,422 --> 01:19:38,762
Oh, I'm a fucking mess.

1104
01:19:39,172 --> 01:19:40,512
Hey.

1105
01:19:40,588 --> 01:19:41,588
Hey.

1106
01:19:42,547 --> 01:19:44,047
Take it easy.

1107
01:19:44,422 --> 01:19:46,132
Please. Come on, it's okay.

1108
01:19:47,338 --> 01:19:48,458
All right?

1109
01:19:50,005 --> 01:19:51,005
Hey.

1110
01:19:51,213 --> 01:19:52,213
Listen.

1111
01:19:52,672 --> 01:19:55,762
If you're serious about getting out,
I got your back.

1112
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:03,840
Thank you, brother.

1113
01:20:04,422 --> 01:20:05,262
Okay.

1114
01:20:05,422 --> 01:20:06,422
Hey.

1115
01:20:06,963 --> 01:20:08,133
Take care of yourself.

1116
01:20:08,505 --> 01:20:10,335
I'm gonna give
the department shrink a call.

1117
01:20:11,047 --> 01:20:12,877
See if she can make a recommendation.

1118
01:20:13,630 --> 01:20:15,090
Okay. I'll do it.

1119
01:20:15,838 --> 01:20:16,958
I'm gonna owe you one.

1120
01:20:17,755 --> 01:20:18,835
You're a good man, Holt.

1121
01:20:19,338 --> 01:20:21,088
No, I'm a dick and I know it.

1122
01:20:21,172 --> 01:20:23,012
But you're family, so...

1123
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:26,760
That's what we do, right?
We take care of each other.

1124
01:20:26,838 --> 01:20:27,838
Even the crazy ones.

1125
01:20:30,422 --> 01:20:31,422
I'll call you.

1126
01:20:41,505 --> 01:20:43,665
<i>Yes, hi, this is, uh, Captain Holt.</i>

1127
01:20:44,547 --> 01:20:47,917
I just need a last known address
for a Heather Russell.

1128
01:20:50,047 --> 01:20:51,047
Just a second.

1129
01:20:51,755 --> 01:20:53,755
Badge number 0304.

1130
01:20:56,672 --> 01:20:57,672
Yep.

1131
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:02,130
Uh-huh.

1132
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:04,010
Yeah, ready when you are.

1133
01:21:33,422 --> 01:21:36,172
<i>Save up to 80 percent
by buying factory direct.</i>

1134
01:21:36,255 --> 01:21:37,665
Ms. Russell?

1135
01:21:37,755 --> 01:21:40,335
<i>A direct diamond importer
and manufactures factory direct.</i>

1136
01:21:40,422 --> 01:21:43,132
<i>The Jewelry Factory has thousands
of diamonds and setting mounds</i>

1137
01:21:43,213 --> 01:21:45,093
<i>and guarantees the lowest price.</i>

1138
01:21:45,172 --> 01:21:46,532
<i>The Jewelry Factory's one-carat...</i>

1139
01:21:46,588 --> 01:21:49,508
Ms. Russell, mind if I come in?

1140
01:21:49,588 --> 01:21:50,708
<i>Are 899.</i>

1141
01:21:50,797 --> 01:21:53,047
<i>Three-quarter-carat bracelets are 149.</i>

1142
01:21:53,505 --> 01:21:54,505
Hello?

1143
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:57,210
<i>And one-carat studs are 399.</i>

1144
01:22:56,713 --> 01:22:57,713
Ah!

1145
01:23:06,255 --> 01:23:07,665
Hey! Stop, stop, stop, stop!

1146
01:23:09,672 --> 01:23:11,422
Get out of the car. Get out.

1147
01:23:11,505 --> 01:23:12,505
Get out!

1148
01:25:55,797 --> 01:25:56,797
Damn it.

1149
01:25:56,963 --> 01:25:57,963
Fuck!

1150
01:27:12,963 --> 01:27:13,963
No!

1151
01:27:25,713 --> 01:27:26,713
Fuck!

1152
01:27:33,963 --> 01:27:35,093
I'll see you soon.

1153
01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:15,590
<i>Holt! Holt!</i>

1154
01:28:16,005 --> 01:28:17,205
I shot her in the hand!

1155
01:28:17,755 --> 01:28:19,005
This is when she gets shot.

1156
01:28:19,088 --> 01:28:20,918
I'm the one who did it.
It already happened!

1157
01:28:21,005 --> 01:28:22,955
But we've gotta wait
nine more years, Holt.

1158
01:28:23,463 --> 01:28:24,343
We've gotta wait!

1159
01:28:24,422 --> 01:28:26,862
But listen, if we kill her,
we can stop it all from happening.

1160
01:28:26,922 --> 01:28:28,552
I could be there for Jeanie, Holt.

1161
01:28:28,630 --> 01:28:30,510
We can stop it all from happening, Holt!

1162
01:28:31,088 --> 01:28:31,918
Listen to me!

1163
01:28:32,005 --> 01:28:33,755
Hey, listen to me!

1164
01:28:34,713 --> 01:28:35,713
Listen!

1165
01:29:10,338 --> 01:29:11,338
Record.

1166
01:29:12,797 --> 01:29:15,377
Timestream location and determination.

1167
01:29:15,963 --> 01:29:17,133
Trial number 32.

1168
01:29:20,338 --> 01:29:22,298
Injecting marks one through three.

1169
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:33,880
Now...

1170
01:29:34,588 --> 01:29:38,048
attempting termination
of marks one through three.

1171
01:29:58,297 --> 01:30:00,547
I have brain dissolution on mark one.

1172
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:03,550
And on marks two and three.

1173
01:30:09,797 --> 01:30:11,257
I think we may have a winner.

1174
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:14,380
With the pairing of the coronal isotopes,

1175
01:30:14,463 --> 01:30:18,173
we could eventually be triggering
this solution from a future point in time.

1176
01:30:18,255 --> 01:30:20,125
Dr. Rao?

1177
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:28,005
Damn it.

1178
01:31:07,213 --> 01:31:08,923
<i>Hey, Daddy. It's me.</i>

1179
01:31:09,588 --> 01:31:10,588
<i>It's, um...</i>

1180
01:31:11,255 --> 01:31:12,625
<i>been a while, so...</i>

1181
01:31:13,505 --> 01:31:14,665
<i>I'm calling because...</i>

1182
01:31:15,838 --> 01:31:17,048
<i>The baby's due soon.</i>

1183
01:31:17,588 --> 01:31:19,338
<i>Really soon, and, um...</i>

1184
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:22,090
<i>George and I
have been talking it over and...</i>

1185
01:31:23,130 --> 01:31:24,710
<i>I'd like you to be here for it.</i>

1186
01:31:27,338 --> 01:31:29,708
<i>I think it's what Mom
would have wanted, and...</i>

1187
01:31:31,172 --> 01:31:33,262
<i>I think it's what I want too, so...</i>

1188
01:31:36,213 --> 01:31:37,213
<i>I know...</i>

1189
01:31:37,963 --> 01:31:39,843
<i>I know it's that time of year again,</i>

1190
01:31:39,922 --> 01:31:43,172
<i>and I know things between us have been...</i>

1191
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:48,010
<i>But I'd still love it
if you could make it.</i>

1192
01:31:49,088 --> 01:31:50,298
<i>Either way, please...</i>

1193
01:31:51,005 --> 01:31:52,045
<i>call me back.</i>

1194
01:32:09,255 --> 01:32:10,455
<i>Daddy, what's wrong?</i>

1195
01:32:20,713 --> 01:32:22,463
I knew you'd be back,
Mr. Lockhart.

1196
01:32:23,255 --> 01:32:25,005
I really am sorry about all this.

1197
01:32:27,672 --> 01:32:31,212
You're a hard man to find, Rao.
You disappeared on me.

1198
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:34,458
Of all people, you should understand
an obsession with work.

1199
01:32:34,547 --> 01:32:37,377
Yeah, speaking of work,
you can just let me out right here.

1200
01:32:38,047 --> 01:32:39,667
I'm afraid I cannot do that.

1201
01:32:39,755 --> 01:32:41,705
If you don't, she keeps killing.

1202
01:32:41,797 --> 01:32:42,837
That is the plan.

1203
01:32:44,047 --> 01:32:45,927
Changing the world
is a bloody business, Thomas.

1204
01:32:47,213 --> 01:32:48,213
Fucking crazy.

1205
01:32:49,838 --> 01:32:52,588
I think we're both a little
beyond the pale, really.

1206
01:32:57,547 --> 01:33:00,457
I'll be keeping you in a safe place
for the next few days.

1207
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:02,300
Then you'll be let go.

1208
01:33:03,588 --> 01:33:04,668
But truthfully...

1209
01:33:05,422 --> 01:33:06,962
I have to thank you.

1210
01:33:08,213 --> 01:33:12,093
It was your investigation that made me
realize she wasn't a murderer at all...

1211
01:33:12,713 --> 01:33:13,803
but a savior,

1212
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:19,170
and a culmination of my own research.

1213
01:33:19,255 --> 01:33:21,835
I'm developing the technology
she'll use one day.

1214
01:33:21,922 --> 01:33:22,922
Well...

1215
01:33:23,088 --> 01:33:24,838
is using now, really.

1216
01:33:25,713 --> 01:33:28,513
Time travel is complicated.
Hard for even me to wrap my head around.

1217
01:33:28,588 --> 01:33:30,128
She's killing innocent people!

1218
01:33:30,213 --> 01:33:33,343
To stop something much, much worse.

1219
01:33:35,297 --> 01:33:37,877
Imagine you could erase
the American Civil War.

1220
01:33:38,797 --> 01:33:39,797
How would you do it?

1221
01:33:40,755 --> 01:33:42,085
Would you kill Jefferson Davis?

1222
01:33:42,172 --> 01:33:44,802
Robert E. Lee? Lincoln?
All the Confederate and Union leaders?

1223
01:33:45,547 --> 01:33:47,837
But that might not be enough
to erase an idea.

1224
01:33:48,838 --> 01:33:51,258
Maybe we have to kill the people
who made them who they are,

1225
01:33:51,338 --> 01:33:54,128
who gave them their moral
and political beliefs.

1226
01:33:54,672 --> 01:33:56,512
Friends, fathers, mothers, grandparents.

1227
01:33:58,047 --> 01:34:02,047
How far back would you have to go
to snuff out the spark that lit the fuse?

1228
01:34:03,047 --> 01:34:06,667
But if you eliminated
the right combination of people,

1229
01:34:06,755 --> 01:34:08,295
one by one,

1230
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:10,170
until you got to the exact start of it,

1231
01:34:10,255 --> 01:34:13,085
until you got to the one
that undoes it all...

1232
01:34:14,172 --> 01:34:16,262
you could reshape the future.

1233
01:34:17,588 --> 01:34:19,008
And that's what she's doing.

1234
01:34:20,422 --> 01:34:22,012
And I won't let you stop her.

1235
01:34:25,588 --> 01:34:27,008
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1236
01:34:29,172 --> 01:34:31,712
We can't feel it's pull,
but we know it's always there.

1237
01:34:32,130 --> 01:34:33,340
Nothing escapes it.

1238
01:34:34,755 --> 01:34:37,955
You know, the moon is responsible
for conditions that allow life on Earth.

1239
01:34:38,963 --> 01:34:41,803
Well, now, it's responsible
for us being able to save ourselves

1240
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:43,550
from ourselves.

1241
01:34:45,047 --> 01:34:47,757
- It's... amazing.
- Yeah.

1242
01:36:15,505 --> 01:36:16,505
Shit!

1243
01:36:16,963 --> 01:36:18,093
Lock!

1244
01:36:19,963 --> 01:36:21,213
Stop!

1245
01:36:24,630 --> 01:36:26,340
Lock!

1246
01:36:27,463 --> 01:36:29,133
Don't do this!

1247
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:33,960
You have to let her finish!

1248
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:57,130
Morning.

1249
01:38:04,797 --> 01:38:06,337
You know, when I kill you...

1250
01:38:08,172 --> 01:38:10,052
you'll never be able to kill anybody.

1251
01:38:15,172 --> 01:38:17,922
Some version of me
won't have to chase you.

1252
01:38:21,838 --> 01:38:23,298
If you kill me now...

1253
01:38:25,255 --> 01:38:27,125
the world as you know it will end

1254
01:38:27,713 --> 01:38:29,343
in a very short time.

1255
01:38:29,922 --> 01:38:31,512
And you have no idea...

1256
01:38:32,130 --> 01:38:33,130
what's coming.

1257
01:38:34,463 --> 01:38:36,923
You're not the only one
trying to change the past.

1258
01:38:38,838 --> 01:38:40,548
I'll be a regular guy.

1259
01:38:43,463 --> 01:38:44,553
Regular family.

1260
01:38:54,755 --> 01:38:55,755
No.

1261
01:38:58,547 --> 01:38:59,627
You don't kill me.

1262
01:39:04,047 --> 01:39:05,047
'Cause I know you.

1263
01:39:10,588 --> 01:39:12,168
I've known you my entire life.

1264
01:39:14,838 --> 01:39:16,918
You're the one
who told me to take this job.

1265
01:39:24,422 --> 01:39:26,712
And you taught me how to ride a bicycle.

1266
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:33,960
You made me my first ice cream pancakes.

1267
01:39:38,755 --> 01:39:40,875
And you held me on the day I was born.

1268
01:39:51,338 --> 01:39:52,758
This was my mother's.

1269
01:40:20,005 --> 01:40:21,205
You're my granddaughter.

1270
01:40:28,505 --> 01:40:29,705
Believe it or not,

1271
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:32,510
you actually come around
to what I'm doing.

1272
01:40:37,630 --> 01:40:38,630
It's okay.

1273
01:40:41,588 --> 01:40:42,588
It's over.

1274
01:40:48,713 --> 01:40:49,713
No, no.

1275
01:40:50,630 --> 01:40:51,630
No.

1276
01:40:52,338 --> 01:40:53,458
But I do kill you.

1277
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:55,260
Twenty-seven years ago.

1278
01:40:56,630 --> 01:40:57,670
I watched you die.

1279
01:40:59,672 --> 01:41:00,762
You have to go back.

1280
01:41:01,713 --> 01:41:04,013
You have to go back
and you have to stop me.

1281
01:41:08,005 --> 01:41:09,585
Then it already happened.

1282
01:41:11,672 --> 01:41:13,762
Time travel is a one-way trip.

1283
01:41:15,713 --> 01:41:18,633
I can't go back
until my mission's complete.

1284
01:41:20,588 --> 01:41:24,258
If it begins with you warning me
here in this beach...

1285
01:41:26,213 --> 01:41:28,213
then it always ends with me dying.

1286
01:41:31,005 --> 01:41:32,005
No.

1287
01:41:47,755 --> 01:41:48,755
Go home.

1288
01:41:52,005 --> 01:41:53,205
Take care of mom.

1289
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:58,170
Take care of me.

1290
01:42:01,713 --> 01:42:02,713
I'm sorry.

1291
01:42:03,130 --> 01:42:04,460
I'll see you soon.

1292
01:42:11,422 --> 01:42:13,172
- I'm sorry.
- I have to go.

1293
01:42:13,255 --> 01:42:15,335
- I'm sorry.
- I have to go.

1294
01:42:49,463 --> 01:42:51,963
<i>Welcome to Rao Technology.</i>

1295
01:42:53,838 --> 01:42:55,208

1296
01:42:55,755 --> 01:42:57,205
<i>Bridge pending.</i>

1297
01:43:03,297 --> 01:43:04,797
<i>When I was nine...</i>

1298
01:43:05,463 --> 01:43:08,963
<i>an ordinary man parked an ordinary truck</i>

1299
01:43:09,463 --> 01:43:11,963
<i>full of homemade explosives downtown</i>

1300
01:43:12,047 --> 01:43:13,547
<i>and watched it explode.</i>

1301
01:43:13,630 --> 01:43:16,840
<i>- Electromagnetic levels primed.
- Seven, six...</i>

1302
01:43:16,922 --> 01:43:19,882
<i>- Programming destination. 2015.
- Five, four...</i>

1303
01:43:19,963 --> 01:43:22,133
<i>His attack was just the first.</i>

1304
01:43:22,213 --> 01:43:23,213
<i>Two...</i>

1305
01:43:24,630 --> 01:43:27,670
<i>Eleven thousand people died
the first morning.</i>

1306
01:43:28,838 --> 01:43:31,758
<i>Millions more in the Civil War
that followed.</i>

1307
01:43:33,088 --> 01:43:34,708
<i>It fed on anger.</i>

1308
01:43:35,547 --> 01:43:37,707
<i>It spread through fear.</i>

1309
01:43:37,797 --> 01:43:38,917
<i>Initializing.</i>

1310
01:43:39,005 --> 01:43:41,295
<i>It made monsters out of men.</i>

1311
01:43:41,963 --> 01:43:43,923
<i>Until even the ordinary</i>

1312
01:43:44,547 --> 01:43:45,587
<i>were broken...</i>

1313
01:43:46,713 --> 01:43:47,713
<i>one...</i>

1314
01:43:48,922 --> 01:43:49,922
<i>by one.</i>

1315
01:43:54,172 --> 01:43:56,592
<i>The voice that gave birth to a movement...</i>

1316
01:43:58,672 --> 01:44:01,632
<i>turned a small crack
into a great divide.</i>

1317
01:44:03,963 --> 01:44:06,093
<i>It drowned out the best of us.</i>

1318
01:44:07,547 --> 01:44:09,797
<i>And it amplified the worst.</i>

1319
01:44:11,172 --> 01:44:13,422
<i>So we found a way to silence it.</i>

1320
01:44:16,755 --> 01:44:20,165
<i>We found a way to undo the damage.</i>

1321
01:44:20,255 --> 01:44:21,755
<i>Coronal fluid active.</i>

1322
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:24,090
<i>Timestream online.</i>

1323
01:44:24,172 --> 01:44:26,092
<i>To disconnect the dots.</i>

1324
01:44:27,047 --> 01:44:29,417
<i>Subject four terminated.</i>

1325
01:44:33,422 --> 01:44:35,922
<i>Subject three terminated.</i>

1326
01:44:39,005 --> 01:44:40,455
<i>Subject two...</i>

1327
01:44:40,547 --> 01:44:43,667
<i>I volunteered to untell the story.</i>

1328
01:44:46,005 --> 01:44:47,415
<i>Subject one...</i>

1329
01:44:47,797 --> 01:44:48,797
<i>terminated.</i>

1330
01:44:49,047 --> 01:44:51,587
<i>I came back to erase an idea.</i>

1331
01:44:53,130 --> 01:44:55,710
<i>Because some thoughts
are meant to be buried.</i>

1332
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:59,090
<i>Some before they even begin.</i>

1333
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:22,960
<i>When the war between us all disappears...</i>

1334
01:45:24,755 --> 01:45:26,085
<i>it won't make a sound.</i>

1335
01:45:28,338 --> 01:45:29,878
<i>It won't leave a scar.</i>

1336
01:45:31,630 --> 01:45:34,420
<i>There will be no great tale in your time.</i>

1337
01:45:36,755 --> 01:45:39,125
<i>Just an echo of what might have been.</i>

1338
01:45:57,338 --> 01:45:58,338
<i>But this...</i>

1339
01:45:59,672 --> 01:46:01,672
<i>this is your story.</i>

1340
01:46:04,172 --> 01:46:05,802
<i>And it doesn't end here.</i>

1341
01:46:10,672 --> 01:46:12,632
<i>It's written in sacrifice.</i>

1342
01:46:15,505 --> 01:46:17,205
<i>It's written in forgiveness.</i>

1343
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:23,260
<i>And it's time to start your next chapter.</i>

1344
01:46:56,713 --> 01:46:58,013
<i>You will love.</i>

1345
01:47:00,588 --> 01:47:01,918
<i>And you will heal.</i>

1346
01:47:10,213 --> 01:47:12,263
<i>You will teach me how to live.</i>

1347
01:47:15,047 --> 01:47:16,917
<i>And you will make me who I am.</i>

1348
01:47:19,838 --> 01:47:20,838
<i>A fighter.</i>

1349
01:47:23,088 --> 01:47:24,208
<i>Just like you.</i>

1350
01:47:27,505 --> 01:47:28,795
<i>Because right now...</i>

1351
01:47:30,547 --> 01:47:31,957
<i>both of our lives</i>

1352
01:47:32,338 --> 01:47:34,128

1353
01:47:35,213 --> 01:47:36,213
It's okay.

1354
01:47:37,755 --> 01:47:38,875
It's okay.

1355
01:47:41,755 --> 01:47:43,585
