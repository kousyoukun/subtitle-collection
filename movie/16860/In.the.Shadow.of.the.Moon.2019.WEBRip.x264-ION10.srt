I couldn't get up.

Oh, God, do you smell that?

177
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:01,630
Severe hemorrhage...

178
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,047
then hit hard on the steering wheel.

179
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,588
Yeah, but why the hemorrhage?

180
00:12:13,088 --> 00:12:14,588
-[hollow sound]
-What the fuck?

181
00:12:14,922 --> 00:12:15,755
Empty.

182
00:12:17,963 --> 00:12:19,588
[Maddox] Whoa, don't touch that.

183
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,380
Pieces of brain.

184
00:12:25,463 --> 00:12:26,922
[scoffs] Goddamn.

185
00:12:27,838 --> 00:12:29,630
Who invited you two to the party?

186
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:33,755
Officers, I'm gonna need you to dust
all this broken glass for fingerprints.

187
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,505
I'm just fucking with you.

188
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,255
[Tommy scoffs] Yeah.

189
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,880
[sighs]

190
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,297
So how's my sis? She about to explode?

191
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,880
Yeah, any day. Uh, you know, these are--

192
00:12:45,963 --> 00:12:47,130
[Holt] Chunks of brain.

193
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:49,505
Yep, we solved that one, Crockett.

194
00:12:56,505 --> 00:12:57,838
[music intensifies]

195
00:12:58,588 --> 00:12:59,755
Yeah? What about that?

196
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:02,880
Uh, birthmark.

197
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:04,047
Maybe a rash.

198
00:13:05,922 --> 00:13:07,380
Looks like a puncture wound.

199
00:13:08,463 --> 00:13:09,588
Sure, sharp glass.

200
00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:12,797
Boys across town
just caught two more bodies.

201
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,088
Bled out: ears, nose, mouth.

202
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,505
They said both had some kind of mark
on their neck.

203
00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:20,338
A whole lot of birthmarks.

204
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,088
Pump your brakes, all right?
You've had your five minutes.

205
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:24,005
Come on.

206
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:25,755
[siren wails in the distance]

207
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,547
[Maddox] Nah.

208
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:31,047
We're not gonna go.

209
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:33,422
We're gonna stay here. We'll relax.

210
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:35,338
Find our center.

211
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,463
Practice our breathing.

212
00:13:38,547 --> 00:13:41,922
Plenty of people can stand behind tape,
yell at reporters.<i></i>Come on.

213
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,088
I'll drive!

214
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,088
Come on.

215
00:13:48,005 --> 00:13:49,172
[camera shutter clicks]

216
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,297
[camera shutter clicks]

217
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:06,005
Shit.

218
00:14:07,463 --> 00:14:08,963
[Holt] You guys going on tour?

219
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,213
Hey, just trying to learn
from the best, Detective.

220
00:14:13,588 --> 00:14:14,422
Okay.

221
00:14:15,297 --> 00:14:17,505
-Go ahead.
-Well, there was just blood everywhere.

222
00:14:17,588 --> 00:14:19,630
[camera shutter clicking]

223
00:14:19,713 --> 00:14:20,797
[Tommy coughs]

224
00:14:23,672 --> 00:14:24,505
[Tommy exhales]

225
00:14:24,588 --> 00:14:26,797
[camera shutter clicking]

226
00:14:28,297 --> 00:14:29,797
But no brains on this one.

227
00:14:30,672 --> 00:14:31,838
[camera shutter clicks]

228
00:14:35,838 --> 00:14:37,005
[Maddox exhales]

229
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:40,713
Oh! There we go.

230
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,630
Ah, Jesus!

231
00:14:43,755 --> 00:14:46,338
No kind of hemorrhage I know of
includes brain disintegration.

232
00:14:46,422 --> 00:14:49,797
It could be a drug thing,
you know, puncture wounds.

233
00:14:50,338 --> 00:14:53,130
-What we need to do is run toxicology.
-What do you mean, "we"?

234
00:14:53,213 --> 00:14:55,422
Look, you were right
about the bus driver, good call,

235
00:14:55,505 --> 00:14:58,213
but I'm running point on this.
You do your job, I'll do mine.

236
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,755
-Come on, give me a bone here.
-[man] Detective! Detective Holt!

237
00:15:00,838 --> 00:15:03,172
Look, look, look,
I respect the hustle, I do,

238
00:15:03,255 --> 00:15:04,172
-but...
-Detective!

239
00:15:04,755 --> 00:15:08,588
Look, even though nobody said the word
"serial killer" out loud yet,

240
00:15:08,672 --> 00:15:10,672
that time's coming, and when it does...

241
00:15:11,422 --> 00:15:13,630
this is my first big one, okay.

242
00:15:14,088 --> 00:15:15,172
This could make me.

243
00:15:15,755 --> 00:15:17,880
I need to be able
to wrap my head around it on my own.

244
00:15:17,963 --> 00:15:20,588
Just give me a little breathing room,
all right?

245
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:22,963
-All right.
-Detective!

246
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,755
Detective, what can you tell us
about the other two victims?

247
00:15:25,838 --> 00:15:28,088
[Holt] Sorry, everybody,
no official statement yet.

248
00:15:28,172 --> 00:15:30,255
You know the drill,
we're still collecting evidence.

249
00:15:30,338 --> 00:15:32,172
[man] Is there a connection
to the other deaths?

250
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:34,797
-What'd I tell you? He's a dick.
-I can't answer that question,

251
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,588
and even if I could,
I wouldn't do it right here, okay?

252
00:15:37,672 --> 00:15:39,255
[reporters clamoring]

253
00:15:40,963 --> 00:15:42,255
[suspenseful music plays]

254
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:55,505
Eh, you're just making
more work for yourself,

255
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:58,130
and more importantly, more work for me.

256
00:15:58,213 --> 00:16:00,088
You don't want to see
where this goes? Huh?

257
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:01,088
[elevator dings]

258
00:16:01,172 --> 00:16:04,338
Shit. I wanna go kick bums
out of the park like we're supposed to.

259
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,088
Yeah, well, bums will still be there
when we're done, bud.

260
00:16:07,755 --> 00:16:09,130
Hey, you Dr. Hanson?

261
00:16:09,213 --> 00:16:10,047
Yeah.

262
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,213
Yeah, three bodies came in tonight,
all of them had brain hemorrhaging,

263
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:14,963
marks in the back of their neck.

264
00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:15,880
And who are you?

265
00:16:15,963 --> 00:16:18,338
Oh, I'm, uh, Officer Lockhart.
This is Officer Maddox.

266
00:16:18,422 --> 00:16:20,922
Okay. Well, there's been a hold
placed on that report

267
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:22,797
by detective Brian Holt.

268
00:16:23,005 --> 00:16:23,838
Surprise.

269
00:16:23,922 --> 00:16:26,755
-Yeah, he's family, sir. I'm sure--
-I said a hold, Officer.

270
00:16:26,838 --> 00:16:30,088
Can't break protocol every time
some idiot's stuck with a needle.

271
00:16:31,422 --> 00:16:32,588
So it was a puncture wound.

272
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,713
Injection sites.

273
00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:41,172
And deep enough to impact the vertebrate.

274
00:16:41,547 --> 00:16:44,922
So, some kind of poison,
like blowfish toxin?

275
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,463
No. An unstable isotope.

276
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:49,463
Some shit.

277
00:16:49,672 --> 00:16:51,630
Lab techs all have hard-ons for it.

278
00:16:52,005 --> 00:16:52,838
Why?

279
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,047
Because we have no idea what it is.

280
00:16:56,838 --> 00:16:58,297
No one's ever seen it before.

281
00:16:58,922 --> 00:17:00,338
Now, if you'll excuse me...

282
00:17:01,213 --> 00:17:02,963
I've got other dead people waitin'.

283
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:04,172
[buzzer sounds]

284
00:17:06,463 --> 00:17:08,130
[snaps fingers]
All right, we need to think.

285
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:11,922
Hoagies.

286
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:13,297
Last night.

287
00:17:13,797 --> 00:17:15,088
-Pizza.
-Too greasy.

288
00:17:15,922 --> 00:17:17,213
Oriental it is.

289
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:19,672
You know, I think
you're supposed to say "Asian" now.

290
00:17:19,755 --> 00:17:22,505
Whatever, as long as they keep
that sweet and sour pork coming,

291
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:24,463
I'll call 'em whatever they want. Shit.

292
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,255
Listen, all I'm saying is
we got people getting injected

293
00:17:29,338 --> 00:17:32,505
with a fucking isotope of all things,
and nobody can tell us shit.

294
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:35,338
And the times of death are minutes apart,
the bodies are miles apart...

295
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:36,255
How does that work?

296
00:17:36,338 --> 00:17:38,880
I'll take "crazy shit happens"
for 200, Alex.

297
00:17:38,963 --> 00:17:41,630
We had three random victims
with the brains melted out of their faces.

298
00:17:41,713 --> 00:17:43,047
That means nothing to you?

299
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:45,755
I'll admit, it's weird, but... shit.

300
00:17:46,505 --> 00:17:49,588
Remember them two yuppies washed up
on the shore of the lake couple years ago?

301
00:17:49,672 --> 00:17:52,547
Buck naked, bruised up.
Everybody thought it was a mob hit.

302
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,422
Turns out it was just two gays,
liked it rough,

303
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:57,922
having a bit too much to drink
before they went skinny dipping.

304
00:17:58,005 --> 00:17:59,630
But you heard
what the coroner said, right?

305
00:17:59,713 --> 00:18:02,088
Man, your energy's
all over the place, man.

306
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,213
Let the game come to you.

307
00:18:05,297 --> 00:18:06,797
Says the grand master.

308
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:08,338
Everything else aside,

309
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,338
I say this from experience,

310
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:12,630
once that kiddo arrives...

311
00:18:13,713 --> 00:18:15,047
that'll be the whole boat.

312
00:18:16,213 --> 00:18:19,088
You won't have time
to think about shit this much. It'll be...

313
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:20,922
-Yeah. Uh-huh.
-...background noise.

314
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,255
-I hope.
-Give me that ten bucks.

315
00:18:23,338 --> 00:18:24,172
Mmm.

316
00:18:24,797 --> 00:18:26,380
-Say what now?
-[Tommy chuckles]

317
00:18:26,463 --> 00:18:29,047
It's not my fault you've got
a gambling problem. Give me the money.

318
00:18:29,838 --> 00:18:30,963
Thank you. Hold that.

319
00:18:31,672 --> 00:18:33,672
Hey, I'll strike you a deal here.

320
00:18:33,755 --> 00:18:35,588
Uh, give me that... that for ten?

321
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:38,797
Yeah.

322
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:43,755
Thank you.

323
00:18:44,297 --> 00:18:45,505
Gonna make a girl happy.

324
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:46,922
Appreciate it.

325
00:18:48,005 --> 00:18:50,297
[siren wails in the distance]

326
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,422
[Tommy grunts] Oh.

327
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:54,213
Oh, come on, I was gonna eat that.

328
00:18:54,463 --> 00:18:55,422
You're kidding me.

329
00:18:55,713 --> 00:18:56,630
Put it on my tab.

330
00:18:57,047 --> 00:18:57,963
What tab?

331
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:02,588
[police radio] <i>Units be advised 314</i>
<i>at Hydra on 22nd and Armory,</i>

Uh, dispatch, this is car 39.

335
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,922
Could you get the officer at Hydra
and get me on the radio?

336

-[Palmer] <i>Go for it, Officer Palmer.</i>
-Evening. Officer Lockhart here.

337
00:19:18,755 --> 00:19:21,130
You mind looking at the back
of your victim's neck?

00:19:22,672 --> 00:19:23,630
[Palmer] <i>All right.</i>

339
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:25,255
See anything?

340
00:19:27,422 --> 00:19:30,047
[Palmer] <i>Yeah, three bumps.</i>
<i>Little circles.</i>

341
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,380
What about the blood?

342
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:33,588
Anything weird?

343
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:36,588
[Palmer] <i>What blood? She's still alive.</i>

344

00:30:08,547 --> 00:30:09,963
This is where it happens.

530
00:30:11,213 --> 00:30:12,130
What?

531
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:15,088
What'd you say?

532
00:30:16,797 --> 00:30:18,672
Congratulations on your daughter.

533
00:30:20,713 --> 00:30:21,797
Shut the fuck up.

534
00:30:22,713 --> 00:30:24,047
I said get on the ground!

535
00:30:27,797 --> 00:30:29,130
I want you to know...

536
00:30:31,213 --> 00:30:33,172
I'm sorry about your partner.

537
00:30:37,297 --> 00:30:38,463
I never meant to--

538
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:40,880
Fuckin' stop talking.

539
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:48,297

00:31:12,172 --> 00:31:13,297

[officer] Step back, guys.

553
00:32:16,088 --> 00:32:17,547
[siren wails in the distance]

554
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:31,713
[officer] Whoa, pal!
Hey, what are you still doing here?

555
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,130
Did nobody tell you?

556
00:32:35,797 --> 00:32:37,047

00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:46,963
Excuse me.

559
00:32:48,255 --> 00:32:49,213
Officer Lockhart?

560
00:32:49,297 --> 00:32:51,130
Yes, sir. Uh, where's the maternity ward?

561
00:32:51,213 --> 00:32:54,130
Uh, next building, down the hallway,
elevator to the third floor.

562
00:32:54,213 --> 00:32:56,630
I know it's not the best time,
but I need to check a few boxes

563
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:57,880
while it's still fresh.

564
00:32:57,963 --> 00:32:59,005
Lockhart. Lockhart!

565
00:33:03,963 --> 00:33:05,797
Okay, so far, she's a nobody,

566
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,297
no ID, no fingerprint matches, nothing.

567
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,755
All she had on her were these keys.
We have no idea what they go to.

568
00:33:11,838 --> 00:33:13,505
We're drawing a blank.
Mean anything to you?

569
00:33:13,588 --> 00:33:15,463
-No.
-I'll need to see your revolver.

570
00:33:15,547 --> 00:33:16,630
-What?
-Your revolver!

571
00:33:17,922 --> 00:33:18,797
Here.

572
00:33:19,922 --> 00:33:20,880
Jeanette Lockhart?

573
00:33:21,047 --> 00:33:23,797
-Lockhart. Just give me one moment.
-You didn't fire your weapon at all?

574
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:26,797
-No.
-Well, somebody did.

575
00:33:28,255 --> 00:33:30,297
<i>They pulled a bullet</i>
<i>from our girl's wrist...</i>

576
00:33:30,713 --> 00:33:32,338
and it matches a service revolver.

577
00:33:32,422 --> 00:33:35,255
-What are you talking about?
-No one else reported a shot fired.

578
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:37,422
We can't make heads or tails.

579
00:33:37,963 --> 00:33:38,797
So...

580
00:33:39,297 --> 00:33:41,547
what happened down there, son,
in the subway station?

581
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,963
Are you Jeanette's husband?

582
00:33:44,047 --> 00:33:46,088
Yes, yes. Hi, I'm... I'm Tom...
Tom Lockhart.

583
00:33:46,172 --> 00:33:48,005
There's been a complication.

584
00:33:48,547 --> 00:33:49,713
Placental abruption.

585
00:33:49,797 --> 00:33:50,713
What?

586
00:33:50,797 --> 00:33:51,755
She's hemorrhaging.

587
00:33:52,213 --> 00:33:54,297
[faintly] But so far,
the baby appears to be safe.

I'm right here. I'm right here, baby.

595
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,838
You're doing great.

596
00:34:11,922 --> 00:34:13,630
It's okay. Yeah.

597

-It's okay. Look, I got you something.
-[groaning and panting]

598

I got you something good.
Yeah, I got you a bracelet.

-You're almost there, Mrs. Lockhart.

602

[Tommy] Come on.

603
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,422
The next one, big push, okay, Jeanie?
Jeanie?

604
00:34:29,505 --> 00:34:31,172
-Honey, come on.
-Jeanie?

605

Yeah, but brown bears are diurnal.

[Amy] Why are they so angry?

685

Don't worry about them.
They're just celebrating your birthday.

But they sound mad.

687
00:40:01,463 --> 00:40:04,463
Well, you know, some people
aren't happy unless they're mad.

Nothing.

Yeah, I'll be right there.

707
00:41:08,547 --> 00:41:10,047
[dramatic music plays]

708
00:41:11,797 --> 00:41:13,172
[protesters shouting]

709
00:41:20,422 --> 00:41:21,505
[tires squeal]

710
00:41:22,338 --> 00:41:23,297
[Tommy] Sit right here.

711
00:41:25,797 --> 00:41:27,422
See the body yet? Back of the neck?

712
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,255
Good morning to you, too.
Somebody get a badge for their birthday?

713
00:41:31,338 --> 00:41:32,797
I got the call just now.

714
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,755
-She's eight.
-Nine.

715
00:41:36,213 --> 00:41:38,505
All right. Happy birthday, kiddo.

716
00:41:39,338 --> 00:41:40,463
Thank you, Maddox.

717
00:41:40,838 --> 00:41:42,297
It's fine. Don't worry, okay?

718
00:41:42,672 --> 00:41:43,505
Hey...

719
00:41:44,172 --> 00:41:46,047
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

720
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:49,672
No frowning.
We're still going to the zoo, baby.

721
00:41:50,005 --> 00:41:51,172
Give me a pinky swear.

722
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,422
I don't do pinky swears.

723
00:41:57,255 --> 00:41:58,130
[Tommy sighs]

724
00:42:00,338 --> 00:42:01,172
Yates!

725
00:42:01,547 --> 00:42:03,713
Do me a solid.
Look after Amy for a second.

726
00:42:03,797 --> 00:42:05,588
-[Yates] Uh...
-I appreciate it. Go.

727
00:42:06,005 --> 00:42:06,838
Hey, stay with her.

728
00:42:07,422 --> 00:42:09,838
-Have they been here all day?
-[Maddox] All day.

729
00:42:10,547 --> 00:42:11,505
[Maddox sighs]

730
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:13,713
[Maddox exhales]

731
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:16,713
I don't think it's a good habit
to start bringing her to work every day.

732
00:42:16,797 --> 00:42:17,672
It's one time.

733
00:42:17,755 --> 00:42:18,755
It's a crime scene.

734
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:22,297
Yeah, calm down. She's in the car.
I won't have her inspecting the corpse.

735
00:42:24,172 --> 00:42:26,630
You didn't, uh,
put flowers on her grave, did you?

736
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,297
Say what now?

737
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:31,505
Jeanie. There were fresh flowers
on the grave this morning.

738
00:42:31,588 --> 00:42:32,630
No card, no note.

739
00:42:33,505 --> 00:42:34,338
No.

740
00:42:35,588 --> 00:42:36,463
All right.

741
00:42:41,672 --> 00:42:42,838
[camera shutter clicks]

742
00:42:46,213 --> 00:42:47,380
[camera shutter clicks]

743
00:43:01,755 --> 00:43:03,005
Nine years, huh?

744
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,297
[camera shutter clicks]

745
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,505
Political copycats?

746
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,255
Where would they get the poison?

747
00:43:15,672 --> 00:43:17,755
Labbies could never reverse-engineer this.

748
00:43:19,672 --> 00:43:20,672
[Tommy exhales]

749
00:43:21,172 --> 00:43:23,088
Well, well well, now it's a party.

750
00:43:23,172 --> 00:43:24,755
[Tommy] Nice to see you, Lieutenant.

751
00:43:27,088 --> 00:43:28,713
[exhales] How's the birthday girl?

752
00:43:29,588 --> 00:43:31,297
Ooh, she's a whole year older.

753
00:43:34,297 --> 00:43:35,130
Hey, uh...

754
00:43:36,422 --> 00:43:39,088
You didn't go by Jeanie's grave, did you?

755
00:43:40,422 --> 00:43:42,297
Uh... not yet. Why?

756
00:43:43,588 --> 00:43:44,505
[Maddox] Josiah Warren.

757
00:43:46,672 --> 00:43:48,380
-Who's that?
-[Tommy] Rings a bell. Uh...

758
00:43:48,463 --> 00:43:51,505
It's an anarchist.
One of those Ruby Ridge types.

759
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:56,005
Look at us, right back in it, all this
Market Street shit all over again.

760
00:43:56,797 --> 00:43:58,130
[officer] Lieutenant Holt?

761
00:43:59,547 --> 00:44:00,755
You guys gotta see this.

762
00:44:02,422 --> 00:44:05,588
-Hey, man, I'll take it from here.
-All right, let's see it. What do you got?

763
00:44:09,172 --> 00:44:11,005
[keyboard keys clacking]

764
00:44:12,255 --> 00:44:13,880
[dramatic music plays]

765
00:44:20,463 --> 00:44:21,588
[Maddox] Shit.

766
00:44:22,463 --> 00:44:23,672
Damn good copycat.

767
00:44:23,755 --> 00:44:26,755
We let these insane protesters
take it up a notch every year.

768
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:29,255
-This is what we get.
-[Maddox] Well, up a notch to murder.

769
00:44:29,338 --> 00:44:32,963
[Holy] It only takes one deranged enough
to dress like her and kill like her.

770
00:44:33,047 --> 00:44:35,047
-Really?
-If it's not one of them, who is it?

771
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,047
I mean, come on,
you're the brilliant detectives.

772
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:38,505
You got any ideas?

773
00:44:38,588 --> 00:44:39,755
[keyboard key clacking]

774
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:43,505
-[Maddox] None of it makes any sense.
-[Tommy] Has anybody else seen this?

775
00:44:44,088 --> 00:44:47,005
-[officer] Not so far in security.
-Good, let's keep it that way.

776
00:44:47,088 --> 00:44:48,880
No news, no talking to reporters.

777
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:52,130
Protesters are just looking
for a reason to riot.

778
00:44:52,213 --> 00:44:53,838
That's not your call, Detective.

779
00:45:03,797 --> 00:45:05,172
[phone ringing in the background]

780
00:45:41,422 --> 00:45:42,255
[Maddox] Lock?

781
00:45:46,297 --> 00:45:47,213
You good, man?

782
00:45:51,338 --> 00:45:52,463
Nine years, huh?

783
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:57,755
You know, there was something
I never told you about that night,

784
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:58,838
down in the subway.

785
00:46:00,963 --> 00:46:02,172
She told me things.

786
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,213
She knew about Amy.

787
00:46:05,797 --> 00:46:07,713
Things she shouldn't
have been able to know.

788
00:46:08,588 --> 00:46:09,963
What are you talking about?

789
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:12,588
She said we'd see each other again.

790
00:46:14,755 --> 00:46:16,838
After she died, there were no more bodies.

791
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:18,797
We stopped looking.

792
00:46:19,297 --> 00:46:21,797
We never put together
any of the pieces because, hey,

793
00:46:22,255 --> 00:46:23,588
case closed, right?

794
00:46:23,672 --> 00:46:26,088
Well, yeah. I mean, shit.

795
00:46:29,047 --> 00:46:31,547
I think it's time we put together
some of the pieces.

796
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:37,005
Hey, hey, find out anything you can
about these keys.

797
00:46:37,088 --> 00:46:38,380
-Eighty-eight?
-[Tommy] Yeah.

798
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:39,338
You got it.

799
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:42,172
-Your dad putting you to work, Amy?

And stay safe, Philadelphia.

832
00:47:58,547 --> 00:47:59,963
-Questions?
-[man] Lieutenant Holt...

833
00:48:08,922 --> 00:48:10,088
[sighs]

834
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:14,505
We couldn't find anything these fuckers
had in common when there was four of 'em.

835
00:48:14,588 --> 00:48:16,255
Adding folks doesn't make it any easier.

836
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,713
Yeah.

837
00:48:19,547 --> 00:48:21,297
These two were both left-handed.

838
00:48:23,713 --> 00:48:26,172
These two both voted for Perot.

839
00:48:26,422 --> 00:48:27,255
Shit.

840
00:48:29,755 --> 00:48:32,172
These two have nothing in common,

841
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,630
except for the fact
that both their blood is red.

842
00:48:34,713 --> 00:48:36,630
No. It's her hand.

843
00:48:39,088 --> 00:48:40,005
It's her hand.

844
00:48:40,922 --> 00:48:41,922
What about it?

845
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:45,922
We never told anybody
about her hand injury.

846
00:48:46,005 --> 00:48:47,838
We didn't release that to the press.

847
00:48:49,047 --> 00:48:51,463
How in the hell a copycat
gonna know that detail?

848
00:48:54,547 --> 00:48:56,005
It's nine years ago, brother.

849
00:48:56,338 --> 00:48:57,338
Shit gets leaked.

850
00:49:00,255 --> 00:49:02,047
What, you think she didn't actually die?

851
00:49:04,172 --> 00:49:05,422
Is that what you're saying?

852
00:49:08,213 --> 00:49:10,213
Please tell me
that's not what you're saying.

853
00:49:11,755 --> 00:49:13,422
Key is to a Falcon 160.

854
00:49:13,755 --> 00:49:15,213
Fairly common on small airfields.

855
00:49:15,297 --> 00:49:17,963
Unfortunately, there's no way
to match up the key

856
00:49:18,047 --> 00:49:19,422
to a specific plane.

857
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:20,672
Now, hold on now.

858
00:49:21,213 --> 00:49:25,297
It says that this plane
was manufactured in 1996.

859
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:27,380
Yeah, the model came out last year.

860
00:49:28,213 --> 00:49:29,088
Last year?

861
00:49:29,755 --> 00:49:32,088
How in the hell
did she have these keys in '88?

862
00:49:33,797 --> 00:49:34,713
Prototype.

863
00:49:35,755 --> 00:49:36,963
Eight years before?

864
00:49:38,088 --> 00:49:41,713
I made some calls. A hundred-mile radius,
there's only one airfield with this model.

865
00:49:46,755 --> 00:49:47,588
Yo, man.

866
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:55,547
Uh, hey, why don't you do me a favor
and look after her until I'm back, okay?

867
00:49:59,047 --> 00:50:01,213
Hey, hey, hey.

868
00:50:01,297 --> 00:50:02,172
How you doing?

869
00:50:02,713 --> 00:50:03,547
Hey.

870
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:06,172
I've gotta work
a little bit longer, all right?

871
00:50:06,505 --> 00:50:09,880
But Miss Tabitha right there, she's gonna
look after you till I get back.

872
00:50:09,963 --> 00:50:10,797
Okay?

873
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:12,422
It's dark.

874
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,422
The zoo's closed.

875
00:50:14,755 --> 00:50:15,797
Baby, I know.

876
00:50:16,672 --> 00:50:19,130
I'm gonna make it up to you tomorrow
when we go in the morning,

877
00:50:19,213 --> 00:50:21,297
'cause that's when
they're gonna be out, right?

878
00:50:21,547 --> 00:50:22,963
They're diurnal, remember?

879
00:50:24,088 --> 00:50:25,005
[Amy] Mmm.

880
00:50:27,255 --> 00:50:28,213
I'll see you later.

881
00:50:29,422 --> 00:50:30,297
Let's go.

882
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:35,547
I almost forgot. A Dr. Naveen Rao called
for you three times on the tip line.

883
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,255
They wanna talk to me, they gotta come in.

884
00:50:37,338 --> 00:50:38,630
Yeah, that's what I told him.

885
00:50:38,713 --> 00:50:39,922
Detective Lockhart, excuse me.

886
00:50:40,713 --> 00:50:43,005
Detective Lockhart,
I've been waiting for over an hour.

887
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,797
Hi, my name is Naveen Rao.
I'm a senior physicist at--

888
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,172
-You have from here to the door.
-I know you've got a lot on your plate.

889
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,880
I know what I'm going to say
will sound more like fiction than fact.

890
00:50:52,963 --> 00:50:54,797
The door is pretty close, by the way.

891
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,088
I believe your case intersects
with my work in a significant way.

892
00:50:58,172 --> 00:51:01,630
Both appearances of the murderer have
happened during a specific lunar perigee.

893
00:51:01,713 --> 00:51:03,297
In this case, nine years apart.

894
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,630
What you may know
simply as a super moon or a blood moon

895
00:51:05,713 --> 00:51:08,005
are actually events
of great scientific significance.

896
00:51:08,088 --> 00:51:08,922
Fascinating.

897
00:51:09,005 --> 00:51:11,005
When the lunar cycle
reaches exactly the right point,

898
00:51:11,088 --> 00:51:14,588
its gravitational forces react
with electromagnetic pockets and...

899
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:16,213
Hey, whoa!

900
00:51:16,963 --> 00:51:20,005
...theoretically creates a kind of bridge.

901
00:51:22,463 --> 00:51:23,963
Yeah, bridge to where?

902
00:51:24,505 --> 00:51:26,130
Another place entirely.

903
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,172
My advice:

904
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,755
take it to Channel Five.

905
00:51:34,338 --> 00:51:35,672
They'll eat this shit up.

906
00:51:35,755 --> 00:51:37,213
[dark music plays]

907
00:51:47,713 --> 00:51:48,547

[dramatic music plays]

909
00:52:25,963 --> 00:52:28,088
Well, it's locked.

910
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:31,005
Time to call it a night. Let's go home.

911
00:52:32,505 --> 00:52:34,005
[object clattering]

912
00:52:34,838 --> 00:52:36,797
Oh, you see that? Someone's here.

913
00:52:38,463 --> 00:52:39,505
We gotta go in.

914
00:52:41,297 --> 00:52:42,797
Don't do this, man, not like this.

915
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,047
Hey, you got a better idea, I'm all ears.

916
00:52:45,588 --> 00:52:46,713
[exhales]

917
00:52:47,213 --> 00:52:48,297
You've got that look.

918
00:52:49,088 --> 00:52:51,588
-[Tommy] What's that supposed to mean?
-You know.

919
00:52:51,672 --> 00:52:52,588
No, I don't know.

920
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:55,838
Don't use this
as some kind of fucked-up way

921
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:57,922
of dealing with what happened
to Jeanie.

922
00:53:01,088 --> 00:53:02,088
Lock.

923
00:53:02,297 --> 00:53:03,588
Leave it alone.

924
00:53:03,672 --> 00:53:04,547
Don't...

925
00:53:06,922 --> 00:53:07,755
Lock.

926
00:53:09,422 --> 00:53:10,255
[grunts]

927
00:53:11,255 --> 00:53:12,088
Lock!

928
00:53:19,213 --> 00:53:20,088
[knocking]

929
00:53:21,422 --> 00:53:22,505
Hey, how'd you get in here?

930
00:53:22,588 --> 00:53:25,297
Hey. Detective Lockhart. Uh, Philly PD.

931
00:53:27,297 --> 00:53:28,130
You, uh...

932
00:53:30,755 --> 00:53:31,963
seen this woman?

933
00:53:33,088 --> 00:53:34,213
Can't say that I have.

934
00:53:39,672 --> 00:53:41,797
[sheet of paper rustling]

935
00:53:43,422 --> 00:53:45,297
-Everything all right tonight?
-Yeah.

936
00:53:46,005 --> 00:53:47,463
Yeah, everything's fine. Why?

937
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:52,088
No, just...

938
00:53:53,005 --> 00:53:54,297
you're here kind of late.

939
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:55,297
Yeah, I had a...

940
00:53:55,755 --> 00:53:57,088
I had a guy call in and cancel.

941
00:53:57,172 --> 00:53:59,463
But, you know,
still gotta do the paperwork, right?

942
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:02,213
Never enough paperwork.

943
00:54:02,922 --> 00:54:04,713
No. No, there never is.

944
00:54:06,672 --> 00:54:07,547
Ah...

945
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:09,630
[dark music plays]

946
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:11,588
Well, okay.

947
00:54:12,672 --> 00:54:13,505
Ah...

948
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,338
Well, you know, let me give you my number.

949
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,005
In case anything...

950
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:22,172
you know, comes to mind.

951
00:54:23,588 --> 00:54:24,963
[writing]

952
00:54:31,463 --> 00:54:32,588
Yeah.

953
00:54:32,672 --> 00:54:33,922
Thanks. Yeah.

954
00:54:34,005 --> 00:54:35,797
Thanks. Maybe I will.

955
00:54:37,963 --> 00:54:40,005
All right. Oh, uh, you know,
before I forget...

956
00:54:41,088 --> 00:54:41,963
uh,

957
00:54:42,047 --> 00:54:44,963
what's the best way to get back
to the turnpike from here?

958
00:54:46,255 --> 00:54:47,588
Could you draw me a map?

959
00:54:50,005 --> 00:54:50,922
Sure.

960
00:54:55,088 --> 00:54:56,297
It's, uh...

961
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:00,505
It's that way.

962
00:55:02,047 --> 00:55:03,047
Appreciate that.

963
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:06,963

00:55:09,297 --> 00:55:10,213
Hey, Tom.

966
00:55:13,047 --> 00:55:14,255
Nice to see you again.

967
00:55:15,505 --> 00:55:17,130
Holy shit, it is you.

969
00:55:18,713 --> 00:55:19,630

If you were a better shot, I'd be dead.

972
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:30,422
Now, sit down.

973
00:55:31,088 --> 00:55:32,255
-Sit!
-Yeah.

978
00:55:44,505 --> 00:55:46,630
Just stay calm. Relax.

-Okay.
-You.

00:56:05,922 --> 00:56:07,588
Get me the key to that plane outside.

00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,963
-Okay.
-Move!

986
00:56:10,755 --> 00:56:11,922
I saw you die.

987
00:56:13,005 --> 00:56:14,338
Yeah, you did.

988
00:56:16,922 --> 00:56:18,505
-Here it is.
-Toss me the keys.

989
00:56:18,588 --> 00:56:21,088

Listen.

00:58:33,422 --> 00:58:35,130
You have to stop chasing me.

I'm doing all this for a reason.

I'm saving people's lives.

1022
00:58:43,505 --> 00:58:44,713
You murdered my partner.

when the moon sets,

00:58:59,255 --> 00:59:00,172
I can come back.

What do you mean come back? Huh?

1031

The more I tell you,
the more you'll keep coming after me.

1032
00:59:11,797 --> 00:59:13,963
And I've seen how that turns out for you.

You can choose to stop.

We'll continue searching the area,
but so far, there's still no sign of her.

Well, keep looking.

1057
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:07,047
You won't find anything.

1058
01:02:09,588 --> 01:02:10,630
She's gone, Holt.

01:13:15,672 --> 01:13:16,588
For your bracelet.

1236
01:13:22,213 --> 01:13:24,213
Dad, I haven't worn that thing in years.

1237
01:13:27,297 --> 01:13:28,130
Oh.

1238
01:13:32,547 --> 01:13:34,130
Well, I kept the receipt, so...

1239
01:13:35,922 --> 01:13:36,880
Thanks for trying.

1240
01:13:43,255 --> 01:13:44,172
[sighs]

1241
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:48,963
Look, Ames, I know how things have been.

1242
01:13:51,005 --> 01:13:51,838
I get it.

1243
01:13:53,797 --> 01:13:55,838
I'm not Mr. Ideal Dad or whatever.

1244
01:13:58,713 --> 01:14:00,755
But I'm gonna finish this thing soon.

1245
01:14:03,088 --> 01:14:06,213
I promise you,
and then we're gonna get back to normal.

1246
01:14:06,588 --> 01:14:08,588
Just me and you, just like old times.

1247
01:14:08,963 --> 01:14:11,047
Dad, that's not how things work.
You can't just...

1248
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:15,213
[sniffles]

1249
01:14:16,172 --> 01:14:17,422
You gotta let it go.

1250
01:14:20,672 --> 01:14:21,505
And seriously,

1251
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:22,713
lose the beard.

1252
01:14:23,838 --> 01:14:24,672
Right.

1253
01:14:25,172 --> 01:14:26,005
Hey...

1254
01:14:26,505 --> 01:14:27,588
Uncle Brian home?

1255
01:14:28,088 --> 01:14:28,922
Bye, Dad.

1256
01:14:29,463 --> 01:14:30,588
You have him call me!

1257
01:15:14,463 --> 01:15:15,338
Hey.

1258
01:15:21,172 --> 01:15:22,255
You got that address?

1259
01:15:22,422 --> 01:15:23,547
Heather Russell?

1260
01:15:25,922 --> 01:15:27,547
Yeah, that's why you're here, right?

1261
01:15:28,255 --> 01:15:30,338
Look, for Jane and for Amy's sake,

1262
01:15:30,422 --> 01:15:31,547
I've been patient.

1263
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:33,505
Hey, hey, we missed one of our victims.

1264
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:37,505
Harold Nowak.

1265
01:15:38,838 --> 01:15:40,880
Just outside our jurisdiction, so...

1266
01:15:41,297 --> 01:15:44,505
Local boys wrote it off as a drug overdose
so we never caught it.

1267
01:15:48,588 --> 01:15:49,672
How'd you get that?

1268
01:15:50,172 --> 01:15:51,297
He was a nut.

1269
01:15:52,255 --> 01:15:53,547
Had a fringe militia club.

1270
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:54,755
The Real American Movement.

1271
01:15:54,838 --> 01:15:57,005
Wanted to take the country back
for the true patriots.

1272
01:15:57,088 --> 01:15:59,922
You know, homemade fertilizer bombs.
You know the type.

1273
01:16:02,713 --> 01:16:04,005
And I got his mailing list.

1274
01:16:06,422 --> 01:16:08,880
Two of the four victims from '97
were on it.

1275
01:16:08,963 --> 01:16:11,422
All of 'em from '88,
that's the connection.

1276
01:16:12,338 --> 01:16:14,005
They're all part of this radical movement.

1277
01:16:14,088 --> 01:16:16,005
-Tom.
-They were up to something big.

1278
01:16:16,588 --> 01:16:18,838
And I'm thinking that isotope
that she injects them with

1279
01:16:18,922 --> 01:16:21,463
is some high-tech way
of killing people remotely.

1280
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,922
And it's triggered
from the future, maybe. I...

1281
01:16:24,005 --> 01:16:25,047
I don't know. I don't...

1282
01:16:25,130 --> 01:16:27,088
I don't entirely
have that pinned down yet.

1283
01:16:27,172 --> 01:16:29,505
-Tom...
-You remember Naveen Rao

1284
01:16:29,588 --> 01:16:31,547
and his theory
about the lunar cycle bridge thing?

1285
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:32,755
Jesus, Tom.

1286
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:34,588
Had to do with the moon.

1287
01:16:36,172 --> 01:16:37,130
You need help.

1288
01:16:40,672 --> 01:16:41,547
[scoffs]

1289
01:16:42,088 --> 01:16:42,963
You don't get it.

1290
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:47,630
She gets torn apart by a train
and nine years later she's back,

1291
01:16:47,713 --> 01:16:48,880
alive and killing.

1292
01:16:53,797 --> 01:16:54,630
Listen.

1293
01:16:58,297 --> 01:16:59,672
We're all going forward.

1294
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:01,755
But her...

1295
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:03,505
She's going backward.

1296
01:17:04,088 --> 01:17:05,672
Decade by decade.

1297
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:07,838
So that shit in '97...

1298
01:17:08,547 --> 01:17:09,797
she didn't come back to life.

1299
01:17:11,755 --> 01:17:13,672
She just wasn't dead yet.

1300
01:17:13,755 --> 01:17:15,005
You sound insane.

1301
01:17:15,547 --> 01:17:19,338
Okay? You sound like a fuckin'
insane person right now. You need help.

1302
01:17:21,088 --> 01:17:22,755
She knew things about me, Holt.

1303
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:26,213
She knew things about Jeanie,

1304
01:17:26,588 --> 01:17:27,422
and Amy.

1305
01:17:28,422 --> 01:17:29,922
Things that she couldn't know.

1306
01:17:30,422 --> 01:17:31,963
And she killed Maddox.

1307
01:17:33,672 --> 01:17:35,130
She's coming back again...

1308
01:17:36,088 --> 01:17:37,047
and it's today.

1309
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:41,005
Do you...?

1310
01:17:42,338 --> 01:17:44,005
Have you completely lost
your fuckin' mind?

1311
01:17:44,088 --> 01:17:47,880
You're talking about a case...
that's been cold for a fuckin' decade.

1312
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:51,130
You know how many murders
I've had in the past week?

1313
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,213
I'm raising your own daughter,
for Christ sake,

1314
01:17:54,297 --> 01:17:57,047
and you're coming to me
with fucking time travel?

1315
01:18:00,422 --> 01:18:02,172
Are you even listening to yourself?

1316
01:18:08,463 --> 01:18:09,505
You're all I got.

1317
01:18:10,755 --> 01:18:12,755
I couldn't stop what happened to Jeanie.

1318
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:14,380
But I can stop her.

1319
01:18:15,463 --> 01:18:17,755
This is Harold Nowak's wife.

1320
01:18:18,672 --> 01:18:20,588
This is his muse.

1321
01:18:22,547 --> 01:18:24,255
All I want is her address.

1322
01:18:24,547 --> 01:18:27,047
And I won't ask you for nothing
ever again.

1323
01:18:27,922 --> 01:18:28,838
I promise.

1324
01:18:29,922 --> 01:18:30,755
Please.

1325

It's just fucking sad to watch.

1327
01:18:42,838 --> 01:18:44,838
It's sad that Amy has to watch it.

1328
01:18:53,297 --> 01:18:54,255
Is it worth it?

1329

Maybe I...

1332
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:20,172
maybe I need help.

1333
01:19:25,213 --> 01:19:26,880
I'm sorry for all the shit, man.

1334
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:31,463

for you taking care of Amy and, uh...

1350
01:20:13,630 --> 01:20:15,088
Okay. I'll do it.

1351
01:20:15,838 --> 01:20:16,963
I'm gonna owe you one.

1352

You're a hard man to find, Rao.
You disappeared on me.

Of all people, you should understand

Yeah, speaking of work,
you can just let me out right here.

I'm afraid I cannot do that.

But truthfully...

1493
01:33:05,422 --> 01:33:06,963
I have to thank you.

1494
01:33:08,213 --> 01:33:12,088
It was your investigation that made me
realize she wasn't a murderer at all...

1495
01:33:12,713 --> 01:33:13,797
but a savior,

1496
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:19,172

1502
01:33:30,213 --> 01:33:33,338
To stop something much, much worse.

1503
01:33:35,297 --> 01:33:37,880
Imagine you could erase
the American Civil War.

1504
01:33:38,797 --> 01:33:39,797
How would you do it?

1505
01:33:40,755 --> 01:33:42,088
Would you kill Jefferson Davis?

1506
01:33:42,172 --> 01:33:44,797
Robert E. Lee? Lincoln?
All the Confederate and Union leaders?

1507
01:33:45,547 --> 01:33:47,838
But that might not be enough
to erase an idea.

1508
01:33:48,838 --> 01:33:51,255
Maybe we have to kill the people
who made them who they are,

1509
01:33:51,338 --> 01:33:54,130
who gave them their moral
and political beliefs.

1510

Friends, fathers, mothers, grandparents.

1511
01:33:58,047 --> 01:34:02,047
How far back would you have to go
to snuff out the spark that lit the fuse?

1512
01:34:03,047 --> 01:34:06,672
But if you eliminated
the right combination of people,

1513
01:34:06,755 --> 01:34:08,297
one by one,

1514
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:10,172
until you got to the exact start of it,

1515
01:34:10,255 --> 01:34:13,088
until you got to the one
that undoes it all...

1516
01:34:14,172 --> 01:34:16,255
you could reshape the future.

1517
01:34:17,588 --> 01:34:19,005
And that's what she's doing.

1518
