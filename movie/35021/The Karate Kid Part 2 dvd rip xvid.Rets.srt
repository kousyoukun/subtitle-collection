1
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,280
Wouldn't a flyswatter be easier?

2
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,280
Man who catch fly with chopstick...

3
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,200
accomplish anything.

4
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,640
You ever catch one?

5
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,280
Not yet.

6
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,360
What was that you were doing
on those stumps over there?

7
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,520
- Called "crane technique."
- Does it work?

8
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,400
If do right, no can defense.

9
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,960
Could you teach me?

10
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,360
First learn stand,
then learn fly.

11
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,840
Nature rule, Daniel-san.
Not mine.

12
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,000
- Where'd you learn it from?
- Father teach.

13
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,840
- You must have had some father.
- Oh, yes.

14
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,400
"Valor."

15
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,560
Johnny, leave him alone!
He's had enough!

16
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,120
- I'll decide when he's had enough!
- What is wrong with you?

17
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,040
- An enemy deserves no mercy!
- Right!

18
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,640
- No mercy!
- Right!

19
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
You're crazy!

20
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,080
Tommy, Bobby, get him!

21
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,160
Mercy is for the weak.

22
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,080
Here, on the street,
in competition...

23
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,080
a man confronts you,
he is the enemy.

24
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,760
An enemy deserves no mercy.
What is the problem, Mr. Lawrence?

25
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,320
Come on, let's forget this.

26
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,760
Wait. Not yet.

27
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,320
Time out.

28
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,280
Go to your sensei.
Turn. Kneel.

29
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,480
Johnny, you're a cream puff!.

30
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,000
Sweep the leg.

31
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,320
You have a problem with that?

32
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,640
No, Sensei.

33
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,040
No mercy.

34
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,080
It's over,Johnny!
You did it!

35
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,400
LaRusso, you okay?
Can you go on?

36
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,120
Get him a body bag!

37
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,680
- All right, feet.
- Do it again!

38
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,720
That's a warning for
illegal contact to the knee.

39
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Finish it!
No mercy!

40
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,440
No mercy!
Way to finish,Johnny!

41
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,720
Finish him!

42
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,480
Winner!

43
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,160
Hey, Mr. Miyagi,
you know, I was thinking.

44
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,760
About what, Daniel-san?

45
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,760
That maybe we should have
a strategy now, you know?

46
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,200
For what?

47
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,960
My future.
My whole tournament career.

48
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,960
Miyagi already have one.

49
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,920
Really? What is it?

50
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,400
Early retirement.

51
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,240
Ali and mother
wait for us at restaurant.

52
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,000
I know. I'm starving.

53
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,960
- That was great.
- Thank you.

54
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,840
LaRusso, very impressive win.
You showed a lot of poise.

55
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,080
People are gonna be talking about that
last kick for years. Congratulations.

56
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,480
Get out of my way!
Out of my way!

57
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,360
- What you doin' to the brother?
- Don't play with me.

58
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,800
Excuse me.

59
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,360
Why does he act like that?

60
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,760
That guy just doesn't know
what karate's all about.

61
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,920
- Well, maybe he should learn.
- Would you like to teach him?

62
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,240
- Good luck, Daniel.
- Thanks.

63
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,680
- Take care.
- Thanks.

64
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,000
Oy, keep ladies waiting.

65
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,920
- Wait, wait!
- What?

66
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,120
- Could we have your autograph?
- Yeah, man!

67
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,360
- So, how you guys doin'?
- Great.

68
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,480
Oh, yeah?
Where are you from?

69
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,560
- Reseda.
- You're from Res--

70
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,320
I'm from Reseda.
I moved there a couple months ago.

71
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,560
- Maybe we'll see you sometime.
- Daniel-san.

72
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,320
- What?
- Come. Getting late.

73
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,800
It's the price of fame.
Gotta get used to it.

74
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,400
Take it easy.
Maybe I'll see you.

75
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,040
That's not fair.
I got second place.

76
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,480
Second place is no place!
You're off the team!

77
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,400
- I did my best.
- What did you say?

78
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,240
- I did my best.
- You're nothin'! You're a loser!

79
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,760
- No, you're the loser.
- I'm the loser, huh?

80
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,640
- Now who's the loser?
- You're really sick, man.

81
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,880
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- Don't!

82
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,320
How does second place
feel now, huh?

83
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,440
- He can't breathe!
- Mind your business.

84
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,520
- You're gonna kill him!
- Sensei, please.

85
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,240
You're hurting him.
He's sorry. He really is.

86
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,400
- Let him go.
- Mr. Miyagi's right.

87
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,920
Let him go!

88
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,880
I said, let him go!

89
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,160
Beat it, slope, or you're next.

90
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,680
Mercy is for the weak.

91
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,800
We do not train
to be merciful here.

92
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,880
A man face you, he is enemy.

93
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,640
Enemy deserve no mercy.

94
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,560
Daniel-san,
ladies no wait forever.

95
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,920
You could've killed him,
couldn't you?

96
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,240
- Oy.
- Why didn't you then?

97
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,240
Because, Daniel-san, for person
with no forgiveness in heart...

98
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,240
Iiving even worse punishment
than death.

99
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,680
Oh, Daniel-san,
must have been some senior prom.

100
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,000
- What happened?
- You mean, what didn't happen.

101
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,680
First I let Ali borrow the car,
and she redesigns my fender.

102
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,240
I don't know what she did to the engine,
but that ain't runnin' right either.

103
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,640
And you know what else she does?

104
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,520
Tells me that she's just fallen in love
with some football player from UCLA.

105
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,560
- Why didn't she just lie?
- Things could be worse.

106
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,560
Don't worry about it.
They are.

107
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,040
Last night I find out my mom
got picked by a company to go to Fresno.

108
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,320
Two months. We leave tomorrow afternoon.
I gotta spend my whole summer in Fresno.

109
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,560
You're not gonna
be able to fix that.

110
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,600
How'd you do that?

111
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,200
What'd you do?

112
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,280
- Come. Miyagi tell you later.
- Where we goin'?

113
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,200
I have just the thing
make you feel better.

114
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,360
- Probably got work for me to do.
- Hit nail on head.

115
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,000
How come every time I have a problem,
you have work for me?

116
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,680
- Cosmic coincidence.
- When'd you build this?

117
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,640
Daniel-san, watch.

118
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,880
Come. Take off jacket.
You try.

119
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,760
Must focus.

120
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,120
Concentrate.

121
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,760
Focus. Most important.

122
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,200
- I can't, Mr. Miyagi, not today.
- Why?

123
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,080
Because my whole life
is goin' out of focus, that's why.

124
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,840
When you feel life out of focus...

125
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,040
always return to basic oflife.

126
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,680
What, praying?

127
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,160
Breathing.

128
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,520
No breathe, no life.

129
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,160
Oy. Come try it.

130
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,040
Out of mouth.
Breathe in through nose.

131
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,040
Breathe out of mouth.

132
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,920
Breathe in.

133
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,040
Breathe out.

134
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,800
Oy. Now how feel?

135
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,200
Better. More focused.

136
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,240
Good. Come back to work.

137
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,040
- Hey, I did it.
- You focused, Daniel-san.

138
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,520
Remember:
Breathe in, breathe out.

139
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,120
In...

140
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,520
out.

141
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,400
Very good work.

142
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,920
Yeah. I'll be right there.

143
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,960
- How feel?
- Much better, thanks.

144
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,000
What am I building
out there, any way?

145
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,560
Guest room.

146
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,920
- You expecting company?
- Ah, refugee.

147
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,040
Refugee? Oh, yeah?
That's great. From where?

148
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,480
Fresno.

149
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,240
Fresno?

150
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,680
Miyagi talk to mother
last night too.

151
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,720
- And she said I could stay here?
- lflike.

152
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,560
- I don't have to go to Fresno?
- If no want.

153
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,000
Oh, man, you saved my life!

154
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,960
Thanks!
Mr. Miyagi, thanks.

155
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,000
Welcome.

156
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,600
Oy. Iced tea.

157
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,600
Oh, yeah.
Wait. Look.

158
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,240
I made this for you. It's rosewood.
I thought it'd be nice to show 'em off.

159
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,280
Daniel-san, thank you for gift...

160
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,360
but why show off?

161
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,240
It says something about you,
winnin' the Medal of Honor.

162
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,800
It says you're brave.
I thought it'd be neat.

163
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,200
This say you brave.

164
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,160
This say you lucky.

165
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,960
- Oh, Mr. Miyagi live here?
- Excuse me.

166
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,640
- " Miyagi."
- Excuse me.

167
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,000
Mr. Miyagi. Registered letter
for you, sir, from Okinawa.

168
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,920
Okinawa?

169
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,800
Yes, sir.
Would you sign here, please?

170
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,120
This is some place you have here.

171
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,080
From the outside yard,
you'd never know it.

172
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,800
You should charge admission.

173
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,400
My missus loves this stuff.

174
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,000
You mind ifl bring her by
sometime to see it?

175
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,560
Some other time, maybe.

176
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,680
What is it?

177
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,960
My father.

178
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,520
He very sick.

179
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,960
Your father? I didn't even
know he was still alive.

180
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,360
How come you can get
a passport in one day?

181
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,400
Have next-day plane ticket.

182
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,920
You never told me, why'd you leave
Okinawa in the first place?

183
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,320
Fall in love with girl.

184
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,200
So? Why'd you leave?

185
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,880
Was arranged by her parents
she marry someone else.

186
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,960
- Did you ever meet the guy?
- Hai.

187
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,200
What was he like?

188
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,880
Was Miyagi best friend.

189
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,880
So this is your old girlfriend, Yukie?
She sent the letter?

190
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,480
- Hai.
- And this is your buddy.

191
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,360
My best buddy, Sato.

192
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,800
- You think he's still alive?
- We were same age.

193
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,720
What did he do when
he found out about you two?

194
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,560
Challenge Miyagi to fight.

195
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,920
Must've been some girl.

196
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,240
Oh, Miyagi remember.

197
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,040
I make big speech...

198
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,160
in front of whole village.

199
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,560
Miyagi breakwith tradition...

200
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,200
go against parent arrangement.

201
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,840
Marry yukie anyway.

202
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,800
Of course, Sato feel disgrace.

203
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,000
So challenge Miyagi to fight
to save his honor.

204
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,640
- And you lost?
- No.

205
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,600
Never fight.

206
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,440
Next day leave Okinawa forever.

207
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,320
What about her?
Didn't you love her?

208
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,080
Very much.

209
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,480
- Well, did she love you?
- Hai.

210
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,320
- So, then how could you leave?
- Miyagi no believe in fighting.

211
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,840
I know that,
but you guys were in love. Come on.

212
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,080
Never put passion before principle.

213
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,760
Even if win, you lose.

214
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,160
Think they got married?

215
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,440
Sato, his family
was richest in village.

216
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,840
Yukie's was poorest.
Was good arrangement.

217
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,120
It was 45 years ago. He shouldn't
be angry about his honor anymore.

218
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,480
In Okinawa,
honor have no time limit.

219
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,520
You serious?

220
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,600
In Okinawa, honor very serious.

221
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,880
I guess I'd better get goin'.
I gotta go help my mom pack.

222
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,160
I'll stop by tomorrow,
okay, Mr. Miyagi?

223
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,680
Taxi leave 6:00 p.m.

224
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,160
Yeah, I'll be here by then.

225
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,000
Miyagi sorry things not work out.

226
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,920
That's no problem.
I hope your dad's okay.

227
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,200
You're cutting it
pretty close, mister.

228
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,640
- Go airport.
- All right.

229
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,920
Have a good flight.
Nice to see you.

230
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,320
- Hello.
- Good evening.

231
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,240
You will be in seat 32-B.

232
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,640
- Enjoy the flight.
- Mr. Miyagi!

233
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,400
Wait! I'm comin' with you!
My mother said it's okay.

234
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,280
- I mean, if it's okay with you.
- Very expensive ticket.

235
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,080
I got the money from my savings account.
It's all taken care of.

236
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,800
Savings for college education.

237
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,640
So I'll get a job when we get back
and I'll go six months late.

238
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,800
It doesn't make a difference
when I go.

239
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,040
-Jobs very hard to find.
- Yeah, I know.

240
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,000
I mean, Mr. Miyagi,
you're more important than college.

241
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,480
You're more important
than anything to me.

242
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,960
When I need you,
you're always there for me.

243
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,800
I really wanna go, and if it's
okay with you, I'd like to go.

244
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,040
Daniel-san,
don't think good idea.

245
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,600
It'll give me a chance
to study Okinawan history up close.

246
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,760
- Come on.
- Never know you study that.

247
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,280
I just started.

248
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,080
- I'm closing the doors.
- Come on.

249
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,840
- Please?
- Go back to the gate, young man.

250
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,120
Young man coming with us.

251
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,120
Mr. Miyagi, thank you.

252
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,280
No, Daniel-san.
Thank you.

253
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,000
- Hope you don't get airsick.
- What's airsick?

254
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,080
You know the biggest U.S. air base
in the Pacific is on Okinawa?

255
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,640
What's the name
of your village again?

256
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,400
Tomi Village.

257
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,720
I can't find it.

258
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,360
Find Naha?

259
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,680
Yeah, I know where Naha is.

260
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,600
Go south, along the sea.

261
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,880
Find Tomi Village.

262
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,000
I keep runnin' into the air base.

263
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,920
You look again morning.
MaybeTomi Village be there.

264
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,680
Get some sleep.

265
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,560
Was Sato as good as you in karate?

266
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,640
Have same teacher.

267
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,440
Your father?
He taught both of you?

268
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,880
I thought you said your family's karate
was only taught from father to son.

269
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,040
Miyagi ask father...

270
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,520
make exception this case.

271
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,360
If you fought Sato, you think
your father would have been referee?

272
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,520
No referee.

273
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,000
How do you know who wins?

274
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,600
The one who dead doesn't.

275
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,320
It's pretty weird having somebody
go through my stuff like that.

276
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,600
Glad I didn't have
any dirty laundry.

277
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,720
Was this place here
when you left?

278
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,440
Miyagi leave Okinawa by boat.

279
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,600
No airport Okinawa at that time.

280
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,240
I kept lookin' through my book.
I still can't find your village.

281
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,480
- How are we gonna find it?
- Ask taxi.

282
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,480
Hey, Mr. Miyagi, isn't that him?

283
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,360
Can you break a log like that?

284
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,760
Don't know.
Never been attacked by tree.

285
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,960
It is great honor.
I am Chozen Toguchi.

286
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,960
Yukie-san say sorry
she could not meet you herself.

287
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,000
We have a car waiting for you.

288
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,400
Car?

289
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,520
Please.

290
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,640
You speakvery good English,
Toguchi-san.

291
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,280
In Okinawa, it help to speak
very good English.

292
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,920
Myfriend and student,
Daniel LaRusso.

293
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,360
Thank you.

294
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,560
-You karate student, huh?
- Yeah.

295
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,880
- Welcome to Okinawa.
- Thanks.

296
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,080
I hope your stay here
is a pleasant one.

297
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,920
How you know I be here today?

298
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,480
Okinawa very small place.

299
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,920
Village south.

300
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,240
Why, please, we go north now?

301
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,920
Some things have changed
since you go, Miyagi-san.

302
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,160
And some things have not, eh?

303
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,560
Out!

304
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,520
- What's goin' on?
- No talking!

305
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,480
Uncle.

306
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,600
Uncle!

307
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,400
Sato.

308
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
So, coward...

309
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,120
you return.

310
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,600
To settle affairs with Father.

311
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,280
And with me.

312
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,800
Sato, I no fight you.

313
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,680
Then you die as you have lived:
a coward!

314
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,800
You see your father.

315
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,520
Then you see me!

316
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,880
- What are you gonna do?
- Find taxi.

317
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,960
No. About Sato.

318
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,200
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

319
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,600
Nothing.

320
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,520
All this because you had to go and tell
everybody you were gonna marry yukie?

321
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,200
Why didn't you just marry her
and move to Alaska?

322
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,920
Daniel-san, nobody perfect.

323
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,000
- Where you goin', buddy?
- Tomi Village.

324
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,320
Tomi Village?
Never heard of it.

325
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,400
This is Kadena Air Base.

326
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,360
Sarge, Tomi Village?

327
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,760
You're standing on it, Corporal!
Get 'em outta here!

328
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,680
Just take that road
and make a right.

329
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,640
Miyagi remember first time
father teach fishing...

330
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,200
right off this point.

331
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,840
Was 1 927.

332
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,600
Was much quieter then.

333
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,760
Thanks a lot.

334
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,200
Take off shoes.

335
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,960
Auntie Yukie said you would come.

336
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,560
Yukie-- Where is she?

337
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,000
Nursing yourfather.

338
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,400
- I'm Daniel.
- I am Kumiko.

339
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,280
- Please.
- Thank you.

340
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,040
He sleeping.

341
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,520
How you know where to find me?

342
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,280
Have known for many years.

343
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,960
Why you never write sooner?

344
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,840
Out of respect.

345
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,400
For husband.

346
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,160
For your silence.

347
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,960
I never marry.

348
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,480
What did he say?

349
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,560
" If I am dreaming,
let me never awake.

350
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,520
Ifl am awake,
let me never sleep."

351
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,560
Good morning.

352
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,240
You're Yukie.

353
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,840
- You Daniel-san.
- Yes.

354
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,760
Mr. Miyagi's told me
a lot about you.

355
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,000
And he tell me lot about you.

356
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,160
- There's not that much to tell.
- Oh, no, no.

357
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,880
He very...

358
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,560
proud of you.

359
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,760
How's his father feeling?

360
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,360
Very tired.

361
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,200
Miyagi Sensei in dojo.

362
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,280
Thank you.
See you later.

363
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,240
Oh, good morning, Daniel-san.

364
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,840
Good morning.

365
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,720
Welcome to Miyagi family dojo.
You like?

366
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,760
It's great.

367
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,040
This is really somethin'.
Who are all these guys?

368
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,680
All Miyagi ancestor.

369
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,760
Four hundred year worth.

370
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,760
And who's that?

371
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,080
That is Miyagi Shimpo Sensei.

372
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,280
First Miyagi
bring karate to Okinawa.

373
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,920
- The one who went to China.
- Hai. 1 625.

374
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,080
- How did he get there? By boat?
- By accident.

375
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:57,000
Like all Miyagi,
Shimpo Sensei was fisherman.

376
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,480
Love fishing.

377
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,160
Love saki.

378
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,840
One day, strong wind, strong sun...

379
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,400
strong saki, but no fish.

380
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,240
Shimpo Sensei fall asleep
off coast ofOkinawa...

381
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,920
wake up off coast ofChina.

382
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,440
Ten year later, he come back
with Chinese wife and two kids...

383
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,880
and secret...

384
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,240
of Miyagi family karate.

385
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,440
This is the secret
of your family's karate?

386
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,680
- I don't get it.
- Practice. You will.

387
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,600
Come. We go work.

388
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,600
What are these things?

389
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,160
These rules to karate.

390
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,840
Rule number one:
" Karate for defense only."

391
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,680
Rule number two:

392
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,400
" First learn rule number one."

393
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,160
Yeah, coming.

394
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,160
This looks like a town
that time forgot.

395
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,160
I thinkwe went school together.
I'd introduce you, but I forget name.

396
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,880
How come if this is a fishing village,
I don't see anybody fishing?

397
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,800
Yukie-san tell me...

398
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,120
after war, Sato father
bring in commercial fishing boat.

399
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,040
Inside two year, all fish gone.
All small boat gone.

400
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:53,280
Almost everything gone,
except old cannery...

401
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,920
and lots of memories.

402
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,880
Ah, lchiro.

403
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,080
When I left, he was same place...

404
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:04,360
doing same thing,
playing same tune.

405
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,400
- That's a shrine, right?
- Hai. Shinto shrine.

406
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,640
It must be tough times
with all the fish gone, huh?

407
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,720
Very tough.

408
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,360
Most people leavevillage for city,
look for work.

409
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,720
My father, some others,
invent whole new economy.

410
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,120
Go into vegetable business,
save what was left ofvillage.

411
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,080
Everyone owns
their own little farm?

412
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,000
No. Sato own. Village rent.

413
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,960
- That's a bummer.
- You're right.

414
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,480
Familiar face.

415
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,000
After school, Kumiko teach
O-bon dance to kids.

416
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,040
O-bon dance. It's for the festival
in honor of the dead, right?

417
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,440
Very good!

418
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,880
I remember reading about it last night.

419
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,880
What is that, a pillbox?
Probably left over from World War ll.

420
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,080
It must have been terrible here.
1 5,000 Americans killed in ten days.

421
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,520
Yeah. And 1 50,000 Okinawan
and Japanese.

422
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,480
Why we all so stupid?

423
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,280
You have seen Father?

424
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,840
Then we finish tonight.

425
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,840
I bring a nephew for witness.

426
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,320
Then you and nephew both
lose sleep tonight. I not be there.

427
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,240
Your teacher coward!

428
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,080
You leave me no choice.

429
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,800
Wait a second.

430
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,800
Your father.

431
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,440
He want you.

432
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,360
And you, too.

433
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,720
Out of respect for my teacher...

434
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,960
I give you three days to mourn.

435
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,160
When finish, I come back.

436
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,640
You prepare to join him.

437
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,040
You know,
when my father died...

438
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:25,080
I spent a lot of time
thinking I wasn't such a great son.

439
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,560
Like maybe
I could have listened more...

440
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,000
spent more time
with him together.

441
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,840
I felt so guilty...

442
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,520
Iike he did everything for me
and I didn't do anything for him.

443
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Then one day I realized, I did the
greatest thing for him before he died.

444
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,240
I was there with him...

445
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,920
and I held his hand...

446
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,040
and I said good-bye.

447
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,280
Very good, Daniel-san.
Time for next lesson.

448
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,840
All right!

449
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,000
I don't get something.

450
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,040
If Sato hates you so much,
why does he give you time to mourn?

451
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,960
My father was his teacher.

452
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,720
Inside the heart,
Sato still know right from wrong.

453
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,640
He still wants to kill you.

454
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,680
Sometime what heart know,
head forget.

455
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,040
But the guy's looking to go to war.
I don't understand.

456
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,480
Never stop war
by taking part in one.

457
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,000
I know. But what if he threw that punch?
What would you have done?

458
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,040
- Block.
- Think you could have?

459
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,040
- Even you could have.
- I'm not that strong.

460
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,760
Not matter who's stronger.
Matter who's smarter.

461
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,000
I guess that's why
I won the tournament.

462
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,960
Good guess, Daniel-san.

463
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:56,240
From very first karate lesson,
Miyagi father always say...

464
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,400
" Best way to avoid punch,
no be there."

465
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,920
- I don't get it.
- Miyagi say same until I work here.

466
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,480
Miyagi first job,
work for Sato father.

467
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:15,320
One day, Miyagi mind on something
other than fish when empty net return.

468
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,960
That was close!

469
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,000
Drum technique. Understand?

470
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,200
Yeah!

471
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,080
Drum technique.

472
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,200
Let me try.

473
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,520
Come on.Just one turn, please.

474
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,520
You gotta.Just one turn.

475
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,520
Please?

476
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,560
Okay, come platform.

477
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,680
- Great.
- I go pull up hook.

478
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:54,920
Father say use drum technique
only as last resort.

479
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,480
You ready?

480
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,840
I'm ready.

481
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,600
Remember, best block, no be there.

482
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,680
One...

483
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,680
two...

484
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,760
three!

485
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,840
You all right?

486
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,800
Yeah, I'm okay.

487
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,800
Come. Enough for today.
Try again tomorrow.

488
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:32,080
You know, Miyagi and Yukie
have first date here.

489
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,600
Remember like was yesterday.

490
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,800
Happen over load of fresh mackerel.

491
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,760
You all right?

492
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,760
Yeah. I'm sorry.
That was pretty stupid.

493
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,760
Miyagi say that to father
when same thing happened.

494
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,320
Father agree it was stupid.
Father was right.

495
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,560
Is there a counterpunch
in the technique?

496
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,000
Ask drum.

497
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,760
Come, Daniel-san,
talk to drum later.

498
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,480
- Does that guy's uncle own everything?
- Almost.

499
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,800
Hey! There's Miyagi the coward.

500
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,680
And his baby!

501
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,680
- Doesn't that bother you?
- Why should it?

502
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,160
People might believe it's true.

503
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:09,840
Daniel-san, lie become truth
only if person want to believe it.

504
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,360
Is that another
old Okinawan saying?

505
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,800
No. New Okinawan saying.

506
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,480
How new?

507
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,400
About ten seconds.

508
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,960
Are you okay?

509
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,640
I'll get it for you.

510
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,120
Carrots, right?

511
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,320
I'll get it.

512
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,480
Your little teacher
should get hearing aid.

513
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,960
- Maybe you need one, too.
- I only hear what's worth listening to.

514
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,200
Look out! We're working here.

515
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,120
What is this?

516
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,960
So, you cheat people!

517
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,840
Shame! You cheat! You cheat!

518
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,720
We'll talk sometime
when you're not so busy.

519
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,920
You still remember our song?

520
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,480
Sing for me.

521
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,840
Yukie, I no sing long time.

522
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,600
Please. Please.

523
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,640
Oh, we were so young then.

524
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,880
Yukie, why you never marry?

525
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,080
You never come back.

526
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,320
You knew I would not.

527
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,760
Yes, I knew.

528
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,320
My father...

529
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,920
he ever tell you about
how he feel when I leave?

530
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,400
One time.

531
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:31,640
He say he love you very much...

532
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,360
and...

533
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,160
what you did was right.

534
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,400
Except for one thing.

535
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,760
I should have taken you with me.

536
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,880
Hello.

537
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,000
- I am disturbing you?
- What? No, not at all.

538
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,960
What are you doing?

539
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,320
- I was practicing some moves. See?
- What are moves?

540
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,480
It's like karate.
I'm trying to figure this thing out.

541
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,400
Looks like O-bon dance.

542
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,000
Then I must be doing
something wrong.

543
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,160
Doing something right. Look.

544
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,640
- Wow. Where'd you learn that?
- From my auntie.

545
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,200
That's terrific.

546
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,040
You try.

547
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:17,200
No, not me. I was absent
the day they taught graceful.

548
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,240
You were what?

549
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,360
Forget it, it's a bad joke.

550
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,920
I'll try it.

551
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,400
Good.

552
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,880
Wait a sec.

553
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:36,920
Right...

554
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
and left.

555
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,240
We're a hit.

556
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,440
Maybe we could
take it on the road.

557
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,600
But we are on the road.

558
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,000
You dance very nice.

559
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,360
Like geisha.

560
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,920
Let's go.

561
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,400
His little teacher's favorite
technique, huh? " Let's go."

562
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,040
Hey, come on, give me
the drum back, please.

563
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,960
You mean the baby rattle?

564
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,720
Why don't baby come take it back?

565
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,000
Stop!

566
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,920
Are you okay?

567
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,880
You insult my honor again...

568
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,640
and I kill you.

569
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,440
You keep for your collection.

570
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,240
I know you like it.

571
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,200
Are you all right?

572
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,600
Yeah, I'm okay.

573
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:21,080
He cheats these people, and I'm
insulting his honor. I don't get it.

574
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,000
He has no idea what honor is.

575
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,640
I kinda got that feeling.

576
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:29,440
Ever since we were children,
he has always been the same.

577
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:33,320
This is the first time I had somebody
ever tell me they're gonna kill me.

578
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,840
This is ridiculous.
I gotta talk to him.

579
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,040
He would only take it as a sign
of weakness and try to hurt you again.

580
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,000
You got any ideas?

581
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,400
Avoid him.

582
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,240
I think I'm on the wrong island.

583
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,160
What's going on here?

584
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,040
Tea ceremony.

585
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,680
I guess it's an old ritual.

586
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,880
It means that they
are falling in love again.

587
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:51,400
- Daniel-san!
- I've been looking for you.

588
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,800
Been here trying
to fix refrigerator.

589
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,960
What's wrong with it?

590
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,720
This. Gotta go Naha City
for new part.

591
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,160
You like come?

592
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,640
I was supposed to go sightseeing
with Kumiko, but I could go.

593
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,080
- You go, have good time.
- We could go tomorrow.

594
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,000
- No, I see you later.
- We don't have plans.

595
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,880
Never keep lady waiting.

596
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:18,360
I'll remember that.
I'll see you later.

597
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,040
Hi. Sorry to keep you waiting.

598
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,480
Be careful.

599
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,920
This reminds me of the Palisades.

600
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,880
Palisades? Where's that?

601
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,040
It's in New Jersey,
where I used to live.

602
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,360
Is it pretty?

603
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,400
Some of it.

604
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:59,520
There it is! The ruins
of the castle of King Shohashi.

605
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,240
The Peace King.

606
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,040
- You know King Shohashi?
- Not personally.

607
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,360
Name of it is--

608
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,160
Now Sato owns it.

609
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:12,840
In old days, O-bon dance
was held here, but no more.

610
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,320
Now every piece goes away.

611
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:19,400
Sato, he sells it to museums.

612
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,280
Sounds like him.

613
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:26,520
Legend is, if you race up to the castle
and win, your wish will come true.

614
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,120
Yeah? I'll give you a head start.

615
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,280
Not necessary, thank you.

616
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,160
Excuse me.

617
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,160
Ready, set, go!

618
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,760
- I won!
- You cheated!

619
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,760
And you know you did.

620
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,600
We'll share the wish.

621
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,480
Close your eyes.

622
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:22,120
Know what I wanna know? What do you
wanna do with your life, your dreams?

623
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,400
Okay, I'll show you my dream.

624
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,760
I still can't get used to people driving
on the wrong side of the street.

625
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,800
- What side do you drive on?
- On the right side.

626
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,320
- I didn't know that.
- Everybody drives on the right side.

627
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:37,160
- Not everybody.
- That's what I'm learning.

628
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,400
You want to sell TVs for a living?

629
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:50,200
What? Interested in electronics?
I don't understand.

630
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,000
There.

631
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,640
That is my dream.

632
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,720
- You want to be a dancer!
- Very much.

633
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:01,480
That's a great thing to be.

634
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,520
Where do you study?

635
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:07,440
No schools for this kind of dancing
in Okinawa.

636
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,000
What a drag!

637
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:13,480
Come to the dance tonight.
Oh, bring your friend.

638
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,840
- Okay.
- Good. See you there.

639
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:20,200
- Like to go to dance?
- Sure. That's Sato's dojo.

640
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,320
I want to check that out.
Come on.

641
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,680
Not inside.
Chozen teaches in there.

642
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:32,960
I'm not going inside. I just wanna look
through the window. He won't see me.

643
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,720
He teach American military police
in there.

644
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,160
Really?

645
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,400
He's not bad.

646
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,520
He is Sato's number-one student.

647
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,120
I can see why.

648
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,320
We must go.
He may see you.

649
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:08,440
Maybe we'll run into
Mr. Miyagi here.

650
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,440
Oh? Why would he be here?

651
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:14,000
He said he had to come into town
to get a part for his refrigerator.

652
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:17,120
Oh! I know that store.
It's at the corner.

653
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,920
- Maybe we will see him.
- Good!

654
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,880
What's going on in here?

655
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,720
This bad place.
We don't want to go in here.

656
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,440
Let's check it out.

657
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:53,160
Come on, baby,
give me the money.

658
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,720
I've got 45 here.
Come on, baby.

659
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,200
Show me you can do it.
Show me you can do it.

660
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,600
Yeah! I got 40!

661
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,520
The guy's standing wrong.

662
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:09,120
-See? I told you. You must use your hip.
-But he looks so strong.

663
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,440
No, you gotta be strong here, not here.
It doesn't make a difference.

664
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:15,840
You think you can do better,
big mouth?

665
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,800
You think you can do better?

666
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,720
- I don't know.
- Let's find out, huh?

667
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,920
- Maybe some other time.
- There is no other time!

668
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Whatever problems Mr. Miyagi has with
your uncle, they don't have to be ours.

669
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:31,240
No. We have our own, huh?

670
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,480
- Kumiko, where are you going?
- You go nowhere!

671
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:38,160
Call my uncle.
You will take bets.

672
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:42,000
Yosh! I give three to one, eh?

673
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:45,680
No, no, I'm not doing it!

674
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:50,280
You have a choice:
broken ice or broken neck.

675
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,400
He's got to break all three, right?

676
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,720
Wrong! All six!

677
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:59,400
All the bets in.

678
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,720
Not all bets. Not yet.

679
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,000
Boy, am I glad to see you!

680
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,640
No worry, nothing.
Miyagi fix everything.

681
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,080
What odds?

682
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,680
Three to one he does not make
through ice.

683
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,440
- How many pieces?
- Six.

684
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,760
Come on, let's get out of here.

685
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:21,360
$600 say he break all six.

686
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,600
600 bucks?

687
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:27,400
- I cannot cover that.
- You are covered.

688
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,400
Now we have bet.

689
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,800
All right! Give me your money.

690
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,880
Hey, I can't believe this.

691
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,240
I won't be able to break that.

692
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,880
He tried twice and only got through two.
What do you expect me to do?

693
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,280
Focus.

694
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,120
Great, and what are you gonna do?

695
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,720
Pray.

696
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,120
You got it. All bets are in.

697
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,480
We do not honor bet with coward.

698
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,000
Do not embarrass uncle again.

699
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,200
Thank you, Sato.

700
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,840
Pleasure do business with you.

701
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,640
You knew it all along, didn't you?
You didn't have a doubt in your mind.

702
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:17,080
-No doubt.
-Howwill we spend it? What will we get?

703
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:21,200
You get college tuition.
We get Chinese food. Come.

704
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:39,400
I thought you have date.

705
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,640
Yeah. I was waiting for Kumiko.

706
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:44,200
I wish you had one of these back home.
This place is terrific.

707
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,640
No use weapon for duster.

708
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,560
This old rag?

709
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,080
Drop old rag.

710
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,160
- Why?
- Drop.

711
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,960
- What I see?
- I don't--

712
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:04,000
- Primary target.
- Primary target. A little close.

713
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,520
This is foryou.
Dance clothes.

714
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,760
Come on! We waiting foryou.

715
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:25,640
My uncle say your
three days mourning over.

716
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,000
I have been sent to get you.

717
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:32,480
Tell uncle I am farmer,
not fighter.

718
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,680
Sensei, a visitor to see you.

719
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:20,160
Is that same wood
we find together on beach?

720
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,600
Same. What you want?

721
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,040
Come make peace between us.

722
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,520
You forget. You betray me.

723
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,720
I was only 1 8 years old.

724
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:34,320
And responsible for own action.

725
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,520
It explain why I leave.

726
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,080
Fear is why you leave.

727
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:42,040
Sato, I beg you.

728
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,360
Your fear make air stink.

729
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,560
What has happened to you?

730
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,400
Isn't this great?

731
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:28,320
Yeah, it's nice.

732
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,480
Are you still worried about
what happened this afternoon?

733
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:36,360
I came here to help Mr. Miyagi.
And all this stuff, I feel so helpless.

734
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,120
Nothing you can do.

735
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,560
I guess.

736
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,480
Can you dance like this?

737
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,000
I can try.

738
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:45,360
- One, two, three, four. Got it?
- I think so.

739
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,880
Hey, you're very good.

740
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:40,320
You tease me.
You're a great dancer.

741
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,960
Wanna get something to drink?
Sit down?

742
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,000
Where did you learn
to dance like that?

743
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:49,800
I've been my mom's practice partner
foryears.

744
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:52,040
She must be a good teacher.

745
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,120
Yeah, she's great.
Have a seat.

746
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:57,280
- Okay, thanks.
- Oh, man.

747
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:02,680
- You feeling better now?
- Much better, thanks.

748
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,440
That's good.

749
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:11,520
Hey, can I ask you something?

750
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,480
Sure.

751
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,200
It's, you know...

752
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:19,120
it's kind of personal, though.

753
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,480
Are you--

754
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,760
Are you arranged like, you know?

755
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,520
Arranged?

756
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:33,280
To marry somebody?

757
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:37,720
Oh! No. That's an old custom.

758
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,040
Whoever I marry is up to me.

759
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,120
Well, that's good.

760
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,640
Are you arranged?

761
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:48,640
What, are you kiddin'?
I'm a free agent.

762
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,480
What is free agent?

763
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:54,040
That just means that I'm available.

764
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,480
That's good.

765
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,080
Yeah.

766
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:11,280
Oh, no, not again.
I'm not lookin' for any trouble.

767
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,200
Maybe trouble looking foryou.

768
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,040
What do you want from me?

769
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,960
My money back.

770
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,960
Come on, man,
that's all my money.

771
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,320
No. All my money.

772
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:38,320
Don't worry about your little friend.
We take her home.

773
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:52,920
Thank you.

774
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,000
Come on!

775
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,680
Comin' through! Look out.

776
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,840
Sorry.

777
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,400
You got the keys?

778
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,000
Miyagi, come out.

779
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,880
We fight now!

780
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,800
What are you guys doin' here?

781
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,920
Where Miyagi?

782
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,400
I don't know.

783
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,320
Leave him message for me.

784
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,120
With pleasure.

785
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:56,760
Come here.
I want to show you something.

786
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:37,040
Your sensei teach you
how to fight with spear?

787
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,320
Too bad.

788
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,960
Maybe he teach you
how to be coward.

789
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,600
Hey, Mr. Coward.

790
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,640
Leave message.

791
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,480
This your teacher's fault.

792
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:25,480
If he were man with honor,
you would live.

793
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:27,560
But he's not.

794
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,080
Enough!

795
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,880
Uncle problem with Miyagi,
not with boy.

796
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:52,080
No, you have problem, old man,
with me.

797
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:44,800
Act of coward!

798
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:51,240
Daniel-san, you okay?

799
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,680
He was really gonna kill me.

800
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,480
Come.

801
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:04,360
Miyagi make tea.
Make you feel better.

802
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:07,280
Tomorrow we go home.

803
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:52,720
I did not want for us
to end this way again.

804
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:57,240
I would stay if could.

805
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:59,840
I know.

806
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:25,960
Yukie, what can I do
to ease your pain?

807
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:36,000
Take me with you.

808
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,880
Whatcha doin'?

809
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,600
Old custom.

810
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:08,600
When fishermen
would go out to sea...

811
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:12,480
families would offer
rice to the gods.

812
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,720
For a good catch?

813
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,640
For a quick return.

814
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,880
Thought any more
about dance school?

815
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:34,160
I told you.
No schools for that here.

816
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:36,560
Well, there are in the States.

817
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,560
My home is here.

818
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,800
Home is where you hang your hat.

819
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:50,480
You think I would like America?

820
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,880
I think you would love it.

821
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,200
Do you think it would love me?

822
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:03,440
I know one part of it
that already does.

823
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,040
- What's goin' on?
- Let's go see.

824
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,960
Okay, come on.

825
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,760
What are you doing?

826
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,840
I sell land.

827
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,200
Why?

828
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:50,160
Why do you think?

829
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,080
You will destroy village?

830
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:54,600
No, you will!

831
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,680
You win.

832
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,960
I fight you.

833
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,800
One condition.

834
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,120
No matter whowin...

835
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:21,880
title to land
pass tovillage forever.

836
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:24,680
You ask fortoo much.

837
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:28,120
Small price to pay
foryour honor.

838
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,520
You're right. Small price.

839
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,360
I see you here midnight.

840
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:49,680
Miyagi, I wait long time forthis.

841
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,240
No tricks tonight.

842
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:56,240
Ortomorrow everything gone!

843
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:01,080
Their homes, their church...

844
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,560
everything gone!

845
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:20,760
What's this?

846
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:23,000
Last will and testament.

847
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:28,480
Yukie get house here.
You get house and pickup back home.

848
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:31,320
I don't want the house
and the pickup. I want you.

849
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,520
Can't we call this off?
Why don't we just leave?

850
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:39,760
Impossible, Daniel-san.

851
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:42,640
Just forget about
the honor garbage.

852
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:46,800
Have nothing to do
with honor garbage.

853
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:49,640
This have to do
with village survival.

854
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:53,320
This isn't three points and you're out.
If you lose, I know what happens.

855
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:57,440
Miyagi already win.

856
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:01,640
No matter what happen,
village safe forever.

857
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:30,240
So, is this seat taken?

858
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,600
I'm sorry.

859
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:33,840
- Oh, no!
- What's wrong?

860
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:38,080
- Quickly. There's danger. We must go.
- Why? I don't understand.

861
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:41,400
Big storm. Be here soon.
Not safe here.

862
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:43,920
- Where are we going now?
- Back to village.

863
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:30,680
Mr. Miyagi, wait up!

864
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:33,440
Do you believe all this wind?
This is wild.

865
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:35,040
And it get wilder.

866
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:50,800
Are those people out there?

867
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,400
Come. We go help.

868
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:06,840
Stay there!
We coming! Stay there!

869
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,960
They need our help.

870
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:11,200
Are you all right?
You okay?

871
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:13,200
I got baby.

872
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:15,160
I got the boy.

873
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,920
Come on. Hang on. Hold on.

874
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,280
- Oh, no!
- Sato's in there!

875
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,480
Here. Take baby.

876
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:30,480
I go find Sato. Go!

877
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:33,280
- Kumiko, take him.
- Be careful. Let's go.

878
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,440
Where uncle?

879
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:51,000
He's dead.

880
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:01,000
Come! Must work fast!

881
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:10,440
Miyagi! Now you come to fight!

882
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:11,840
Coward!

883
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:15,640
Now when I am helpless!

884
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,080
It won't move!

885
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:19,960
You are lower than the storm!

886
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,120
Now whole village see.

887
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:25,640
This is only way you can win.

888
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:39,960
Come, Daniel-san.
Easy, Sato.

889
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:41,400
Easy.

890
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:43,320
I got you, old friend.

891
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:48,520
You'll be okay now.

892
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,800
Come get me!

893
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:05,240
Come get me!

894
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:07,880
You take Mr. Sato back!
I'll get the girl!

895
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:14,400
Just hang on!

896
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:17,560
Don't let go.

897
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:22,440
Uncle! Uncle!
I thought you were dead!

898
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:24,480
I thought you were dead.

899
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:25,920
Go help!

900
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,400
Help him!

901
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:38,880
I cannot help him.
I cannot.

902
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:59,200
Hang on! Just hang on!
Hold tight!

903
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:16,560
Hold on!

904
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:25,960
Just hang on!
Give me your arm!

905
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,080
Hold on tight!

906
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:39,200
You're gonna be okay.
Hang on.

907
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,840
Miyagi, let me go.

908
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,600
You'll be okay.

909
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:06,280
Thanks a lot.

910
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:25,480
Now, to you...

911
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:27,160
I am dead.

912
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:58,640
How are they gonna
recover from this?

913
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:01,160
All the seeds are gone.
The place is wrecked.

914
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:03,800
- What are they gonna do now?
- Best they can.

915
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:09,120
What is all this?
What's Sato doing here?

916
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:10,760
Don't know.

917
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:25,440
I come help rebuild.

918
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:28,640
Here deed to village.

919
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:32,640
Forgive me. I beg you.

920
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,280
Oh, Sato.
Nothing to forgive.

921
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:41,200
Now's a good time to ask him.

922
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,360
It's not my place.

923
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:49,120
Mr. Sato, O-bon dance is soon...

924
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:52,800
and it'll be hard the way things are
to have it here in the village.

925
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:55,560
What you ask of me?

926
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:59,480
Well, can they have it in the castle?
That's where it belongs, isn't it?

927
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:06,400
Your student become my teacher.

928
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,800
O-bon will be held in castle.

929
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:13,280
Now and forever!

930
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,280
One condition.

931
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:19,640
You dance with us.

932
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,720
You got it.

933
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:34,120
When you put your mind to it,
anything can happen.

934
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:35,800
You're right.

935
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:58,240
If it wasn't for you,
I'd be makin' a lot ofmistakes.

936
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:00,720
Ifnot for you,
I not be here.

937
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:08,960
Now remember,
you have nothing to worry about.

938
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,320
I'm not worried.
I think I'm scared.

939
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:13,360
You kiddin'?
I've seen you do it.

940
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:16,800
You're gonna be terrific.
It's true.

941
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:19,840
- Did I tell you you look beautiful?
- No.

942
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:22,720
Well, you do.

943
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:37,040
I've seen her practice.
She's really amazing.

944
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:33,920
Behind you!

945
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,640
Get back!

946
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:43,680
- Get back or I'll kill her!
- Chozen!

947
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:46,080
Don't do this.

948
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:48,200
I was wrong.

949
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:49,760
Hate is wrong.

950
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:52,720
- lt's over.
- I cannot hear you, Uncle.

951
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:55,160
I am dead to you, remember?

952
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:58,240
Chozen, you are your uncle's
finest student.

953
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:00,600
No disgrace him here.

954
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:02,880
Your student disgrace me.

955
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:05,120
I have been dishonored
all because of him.

956
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:06,960
For whatever happened,
I apologize.

957
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:09,640
Apology will not
give me back my honor!

958
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:12,320
- Neither will this.
- In their eyes it will.

959
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:15,600
No more talk.
You cross bridge, or I kill her!

960
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:24,480
This not tournament.
This for real.

961
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,440
Oy. No bridge.

962
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:12,160
Now I dropped the bridge.
Let her go.

963
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:16,360
- Come on!
- Now we fight to death!

964
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:26,720
Step back, Daniel-san!
Step back!

965
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:04,840
Live or die, man?

966
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:08,560
Die.

967
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:11,840
Wrong. Honk!
