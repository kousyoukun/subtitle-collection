1
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,680
Don't forget to tell Uncle Louie I left
the red wine and Parmesan in the fridge.

2
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,320
I love you. Bye-bye.

3
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,280
- 'Bye, Judy.
- Send me a picture.

4
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,360
I will be back soon. Don't worry about it.

5
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,080
- Be careful, now.
- 'Bye.

6
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,160
- Take it easy, now.
- 'Bye.

7
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,480
"California, here we come"

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,240
What's wrong? Don't you like my singing?

9
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,600
I don't like the song.

10
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,600
You're going to love California.
You get up in the morning...

11
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,520
...roll out of bed, plop, in the pool.

12
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,680
Yeah, sure.

13
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,640
You will see. This isn't exactly a dump
we're moving to.

14
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,280
Push, Daniel.
Give it all you have got, kid. Push!

15
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,400
Okay, we have got it. Come on.
Get in, hurry up.

16
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,960
We did it again. Way to go!

17
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,560
Daniel, wake up.

18
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,920
Look off the starboard bow.
Paradise at last.

19
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,560
We made it.

20
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,880
Come on.

21
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,160
This is it.

22
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,360
This is the end of the line.

23
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,600
You're telling me.

24
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,800
Come on. All hands on deck.

25
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,040
We have got to get this thing unloaded
before it sinks.

26
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,440
Look at those palm trees!
Damn, do you know what that means?

27
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,960
Yeah, watch out for falling coconuts.

28
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,960
- Wise guy. No more Newark winters.
- I like winters.

29
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,880
Oh, you like sore throats?
You like frozen toes?

30
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,560
I don't like smog.

31
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,920
- Did I tell you about the pool here?
- About 100 times.

32
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,240
Okay, so make it 101.

33
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,800
Open your eyes, my darling son.
This is the Garden of Eden.

34
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,360
Come on.
Listen, we're in apartment 20, okay?

35
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,280
One flight up.

36
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,680
- Are you okay?
- Don't worry about it.

37
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,400
- Let me help you up.
- Thanks.

38
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,480
I shouldn't have done that. It was stupid.

39
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,840
You must be the new people in 20, right?

40
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,960
Yeah, I guess so.

41
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,440
- Freddy Fernandez, apartment 17.
- Daniel LaRusso.

42
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,880
How you doing? Let me help.

43
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,440
- No, it's fine. It's heavy, man.
- I got it.

44
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,760
- Where are you from?
- New Jersey.

45
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,320
What are you doing out here?

46
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,600
My mom got a job with some company
out here. Rocket Computers.

47
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,360
Flight of the Future. I don't know.

48
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,200
- I never heard of it.
- It's up and coming.

49
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,320
- Is this the only pool you have got?
- That's it. What was that, karate?

50
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,640
- Yeah.
- Have you been doing it long?

51
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,040
- Yeah, a while.
- Did you ever use it?

52
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,880
- A couple of times.
- I bet you could kick some ass.

53
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,840
I'd like to learn that.
Maybe you could teach me.

54
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,920
- Sure. That's cool. Anytime.
- Great.

55
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,000
This place is a dump.
You should go back to New Jersey.

56
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,680
How did you know where I was from?

57
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,600
because I am from New Jersey.
I got a nose for my own.

58
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,200
- Well what part?
- Parsippany.

59
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,240
- I never should have left.
- My Uncle Louie's from Parsippany.

60
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,920
- Louie Martini?
- Louie LaRusso.

61
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,520
Louie LaRusso? Don't know him.

62
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,040
Hey, pup.

63
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,200
How you doing? You thirsty?

64
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,560
- She's crazy.
- What?

65
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,240
- She's not playing with a full deck.
- She's nice.

66
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,240
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- I don't know. I guess nothing.

67
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,280
We're having a beach party.
Want to come?

68
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,320
- Sure, that's cool.
- I will come get you in the morning.

69
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,640
Here's apartment 20.

70
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,520
- Is it?
- Should I leave this here?

71
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,360
- Yeah, thanks for the help.
- No problem.

72
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,160
Nice meeting you. Take care.
See you tomorrow morning.

73
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,880
Don't say anything about the pool.
I will call first thing in the morning.

74
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,680
Did you tell that old lady
where we were from?

75
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,800
Yes. Didn't she remind you of Aunt Tessy?

76
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,360
- More like Uncle Louie.
- I really think we're going to do good here.

77
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,120
I have a very positive feeling.
I am telling you, Daniel.

78
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,080
I just know it's going to work.
The faucet's broken.

79
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,040
The real estate lady said there's
a fix-it guy. See if you can find him.

80
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,760
What's that for?

81
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,080
- Uncle Louie's dog.
- He's cute.

82
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,960
- I got invited to a party tomorrow.
- Great. You see?

83
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,920
- But you wanted me to help you unpack.
- I don't remember saying that.

84
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,960
I must have had you mixed up
with somebody else.

85
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,240
Thanks, Ma.

86
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,320
Could you tell me
where the maintenance guy is?

87
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,000
Hey, pup.

88
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,680
You go in through there,
turn left, not too far...

89
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,720
...then right, go inside, and you will find him
on the left.

90
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,320
So I go right then left?

91
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,720
No, left then right, then inside on the left.

92
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,560
Hello?

93
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,960
Are you the maintenance man?

94
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,920
We're the new people in apartment 20.

95
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,480
The faucet's really leaking there.

96
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,960
Could you come fix it?

97
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,440
Can I tell my mom when?

98
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,280
When what?

99
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,880
When you're going to fix the faucet.

100
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,040
After.

101
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,280
After what?

102
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,960
After after!

103
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,800
Could we have the ball, please?

104
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,360
Pretty good.

105
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,920
Show-off.

106
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,520
Sorry. Hey, wait up.

107
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,800
- Who's that blonde in the blue?
- The hills.

108
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,800
- What's the hills?
- Rich.

109
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,480
- I think the blonde is looking at you.
- Yeah, right.

110
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,520
- I think she has the hots for you.
- Who could blame her?

111
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,200
- Why don't you make a move?
- No, I am eating, man.

112
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,960
- How can you think about eating?
- I am hungry.

113
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,280
- Maybe they ain't got no moves in Jersey.
- I got moves where I come from.

114
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,920
We have got more moves back there
than here, I will tell you that much.

115
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,560
Let's see them.

116
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,320
Come on, buddy. Go get her.

117
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,600
I am going.

118
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,720
- Lose something?
- I hope we're not bothering you.

119
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,800
Hey, how do you juggle?

120
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,640
It's pretty easy. You start on the knee.
You just go one.

121
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,760
One at a time. Then you try two.
One, two.

122
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,200
And then three and four.
Try it. Just bring your leg up. Good!

123
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,360
- That was awesome!
- Brew time. Who's for a warm one?

124
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,600
No, I pass.

125
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,960
Who are you kidding?
You're the ace degenerate.

126
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,960
Ex-degenerate. Tomorrow I am a senior.
I have got one year to make it all work.

127
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,680
And that's what I am going to do.
Make it work, all of it.

128
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,560
You must be a trendsetter, Johnny.
Everyone's doing something new.

129
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,160
Take a right. Check it out.

130
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,480
- Forget it, man. It's ancient history.
- Who told you, man?

131
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,720
- I thought they broke up.
- She did, he didn't.

132
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,160
Come on, try it.

133
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,800
Watch this.

134
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,880
I will get it. I will be right back.

135
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,400
- Ali, I want to talk to you.
- Leave me alone.

136
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,920
We have been over all this.
I don't want to talk.

137
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,520
I want to talk to you, all right?

138
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,120
- What is your problem?
- Just get out of here.

139
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,840
- That won't solve anything.
- Give me my radio.

140
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,480
I said, give me my radio.

141
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,400
- You promise you will talk to me?
- Yes, give me my radio.

142
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,840
- You just broke my radio!
- Yeah.

143
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,920
Don't touch it, punk.

144
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,720
- What's going on?
- You want it?

145
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,960
Johnny, stop it.

146
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,520
- Stop it.
- I didn't do anything.

147
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,840
You're a big man now, huh?

148
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,360
You started this. I just wanted to talk.

149
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,480
- Leave him alone and we will talk.
- Where did I hear that before?

150
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,240
How about you, hero? Had enough?

151
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,520
- Now we're even.
- No mercy, man.

152
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,480
Why don't you hit me?

153
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,920
- It's your fault!
- It's not.

154
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
- It's your fault.
- Ever think it's yours?

155
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,680
Why do you always have to fight?

156
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,280
Bullshit. Get on your bikes, guys.

157
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,640
You sure pick cool people
to be friends with.

158
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,680
Where'd you find this guy?

159
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,480
Come on, let's go. He will be all right.

160
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,560
- Are you okay?
- Just leave me alone.

161
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,280
- I will help you.
- Leave me alone. I am okay.

162
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,960
Come on, Ali. Let's go.
It's better if you leave him alone.

163
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,960
Come on, let's go.

164
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,600
Daniel!

165
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,400
- How was the party?
- It was okay.

166
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,560
Must have been more than okay.
I didn't hear you come in.

167
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,360
- Any friend material?
- Some. I got to go.

168
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,320
- Eat first.
- I am not hungry.

169
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,480
- You need energy to be charming.
- I am fine, I got energy.

170
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,800
Do me a favour. Take off the glasses.

171
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,240
- Why?
- Because I asked you to.

172
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,400
- It's California. It's the look.
- I want to see your baby browns.

173
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,840
- Come on with the baby browns.
- Are you on something?

174
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,360
- I am on Minute Maid.
- Why hide your eyes?

175
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,040
- I am not.
- Take off the glasses.

176
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,360
Now!

177
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,560
My God! How did that happen?

178
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,480
I hit a kerb with my bike.
I wore the glasses so you wouldn't worry.

179
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,840
- It looks worse than it feels.
- Don't do that.

180
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,000
- It doesn't hurt.
- Can you see? You want to stay home?

181
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,040
I have got to go.

182
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,600
- Hey, you guys, Freddy, how you doing?
- Hey, the karate kid.

183
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,360
Let's see the moves.

184
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,760
- He knows how to get his butt kicked.
- I already know that move.

185
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,840
Let's get out of here.

186
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,960
Hey, think fast.

187
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,760
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you doing?

188
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,240
- Your eye.
- It looks worse than it feels. Believe me.

189
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,520
I hope so.

190
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,520
I never got a chance to thank you.

191
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,040
That was nothing.
I am just sorry about your radio.

192
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,440
I am more sorry about your eye.

193
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,160
You should have just given it to him.

194
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,920
Why? It wasn't his, right?

195
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,280
- Yeah, it wasn't his.
- We think alike already.

196
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,560
You know what else we do alike?

197
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,440
You have been practicing.

198
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,200
- Cheerleaders, over here.
- I have got to go.

199
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,800
- I will see you.
- 'Bye.

200
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,400
- Hey, have you got a name?
- Ali with an "i."

201
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,480
- What's your name?
- Daniel with an "I."

202
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,280
I will see you later.

203
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,200
Definitely.

204
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,200
Get him, Bobby.

205
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,120
Have a nice trip?

206
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,320
Look what he's doing to Bobby.

207
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,080
Nobody hits me. I am going to kill him.

208
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,920
- None of that on this team!
- He hooked me!

209
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,760
I said out of here!

210
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,360
Back to it. Let's go.

211
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,520
This school sucks! It sucks.

212
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,440
52, 53, 54...

213
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,080
55, 56, 57...

214
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,320
- Fix faucet.
- Come on in.

215
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,000
It's the kitchen one.

216
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,800
1, 2, 3...

217
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,560
Karate.

218
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,960
- Yeah, 5, 6...
- Very good.

219
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,640
- Learn from book?
- And a few months at the Y in Newark.

220
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,600
9, 10...

221
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,080
...11, 12, 13...

222
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,280
What happened to eye?

223
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,320
I fell off my bike.

224
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,520
Lucky no hurt hand.

225
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,400
- Ali with an "i." How are you doing?
- Good.

226
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,280
- Not too hungry today?
- Not really.

227
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,560
Have some pie, I made it myself.

228
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,320
- How do you like the valley?
- It hasn't been dull.

229
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,720
Was Newark dull?

230
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,640
How did you know I was from there?

231
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,960
- I asked.
- Oh, really?

232
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,480
- Are you sitting with anybody?
- With you, if it's okay.

233
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,000
- Sounds great to me. Want some milk?
- Thanks.

234
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,280
- Sorry about the soccer tryouts.
- Those are the breaks.

235
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,320
Remember that guy you had trouble with
on the beach?

236
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,840
- Yeah, King Karate?
- He's my ex-boyfriend.

237
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,040
That's good to know. What?

238
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,520
Yeah, you're right. I know.

239
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,440
- What are you doing?
- It's this little voice...

240
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,320
...telling me I have got to be nuts
to be talking to you.

241
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,280
- That will be $2.50.
- For both.

242
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,920
- $3.75.
- It doesn't matter, anyway.

243
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,520
- Why's that?
- Because it's over.

244
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,920
- Wait. How over?
- Weeks.

245
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,700
One week, five weeks?
How many weeks is "weeks"?

246
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,840
<i>- Fear does not exist in this dojo. Does it?
- No, Sensei!</i>

247
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,720
<i>- Pain does not exist in this dojo. Does it?
- No, Sensei!</i>

248
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,480
<i>- Defeat doesn't exist in this dojo. Does it?
- No, Sensei!</i>

249
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,000
<i>- Fear does not exist in this dojo. Does it?
- No, Sensei!</i>

250
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,360
<i>- Pain does not exist in this dojo. Does it?
- No, Sensei!</i>

251
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:35,760
<i>- Defeat doesn't exist in this dojo. Does it?
- No, Sensei!</i>

252
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,000
Prepare.

253
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,000
- What do we study here?
- The way of the fist, sir!

254
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,800
- And what is that way?
- Strike first, strike hard, no mercy!

255
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,920
- I can't hear you.
- Strike first, strike hard, no mercy!

256
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,000
<i>- Mr. Lawrence.
- Yes, Sensei.</i>

257
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,680
Warm them up.

258
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,200
Fighting positions. Jab punch.

259
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,640
Ready.

260
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,440
Guess what.
I am going to be trained as a manager.

261
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,400
Isn't that great?

262
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,040
The programme's two nights a week.

263
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,440
As soon as a spot opens up, I am in.
The benefits are great.

264
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,840
They pay for everything.

265
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,560
That's great.

266
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,960
- What's the matter, Daniel?
- Nothing.

267
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,920
Remember when you went to the country
and hated it because you had no friends?

268
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,360
What happened?

269
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,320
I got poison ivy.

270
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,160
You met Kevin and Kenny,
who became your best friends in the world.

271
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,120
You have got to give it a try.

272
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,600
I know it's hard.

273
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,920
We're not quitters, are we?

274
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,640
I guess not.

275
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,760
- What's with the karate place?
- It sucks.

276
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,560
Good. We couldn't afford it anyway.

277
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,880
And the girl situation?

278
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,040
- It's okay.
- Just okay?

279
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,360
To me it looks like
the whole world turned blonde.

280
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,560
You got your eye on anybody?

281
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,680
Cute?

282
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,120
Not cute.

283
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,880
- She's beyond cute.
- But she's blonde, right?

284
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,480
- She's got blonde hair.
- Lucille, let's go, here they come.

285
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,120
- Is she as pretty as Judy?
- She buries Judy in a second.

286
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,400
She buries Judy?

287
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,840
Tell me about it later. I love you.
Careful how you ride home.

288
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,800
She's got an excellent smile.
She's really smart.

289
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,000
I'd say she's beautiful.
I think she's beautiful.

290
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,560
I think she's something else.

291
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,160
She's hot. Definitely hot.

292
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,560
- Looking for a shortcut to Newark?
- He wants to learn karate.

293
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:54,000
Here's the first lesson: How to take a fall.
Don't think about the pain.

294
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,400
Damn bike! I hate this bike!

295
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,600
I hate this frigging bike! Stupid bike!

296
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,680
What's the matter?
Why did you throw your bike away?

297
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,880
- Because I felt like it.
- Look at me when I am talking to you.

298
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,160
My God!

299
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,160
Tell me what's going on.
Don't say another bike accident.

300
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,360
- What do you want to hear?
- The truth.

301
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,040
No, all you want to hear
is how great it is here.

302
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,720
Maybe for you, but it sucks for me.
I hate this place!

303
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,280
I hate it, I want to go home!
Why can't we just go back home?

304
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,760
Listen to me.

305
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,480
I cannot help you
unless you tell me what's wrong.

306
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,000
I have got to take karate.

307
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,680
- You took karate.
- Not at the Y, at a good school.

308
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,240
- Fighting doesn't solve anything.
- Neither does palm trees.

309
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,800
That's not fair.

310
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,240
It wasn't fair coming out here
without asking me.

311
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,920
You're right.

312
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,480
I should have asked.

313
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,200
I just want to go home.
I don't understand the rules here.

314
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,280
Let's see if we can figure out
the rules together.

315
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,440
- What about your bike?
- It's safer taking the bus.

316
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,080
Why can't we just go home
and forget this place?

317
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,960
- I will tell you everything he said.
- You'd better.

318
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,560
How are you?

319
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,480
- What happened to your forehead?
- It's terrible. A gigantic runaway zit.

320
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,320
That's gross.

321
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,560
Daniel, this is Susan.
What really happened?

322
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,560
I got in a bike accident.

323
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,360
What kind of bike do you have?
A Honda? Suzuki?

324
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,560
It's a Miyagi Turbo.

325
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,880
- Yeah?
- Oh, really?

326
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,960
- We're going to the arcade. Want to come?
- Sounds great.

327
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,600
There's this new game I want to show you.

328
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,760
I forgot something.
I will catch up with you guys in a minute.

329
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,480
- Don't run away.
- I am not running away from anything.

330
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,720
- We have got to deal with this.
- I will deal with it my own way.

331
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,600
- Daniel...
- Get off my case!

332
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,600
Did you fix my bike?

333
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,120
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

334
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,200
I really appreciate that.

335
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,800
Are those real trees?

336
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,120
You like see, come inside.

337
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,960
Thanks.

338
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,560
How did they get so small?

339
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,160
I train.

340
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,680
Clip here, tie there.

341
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,560
Did you learn this in Japan?

342
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,880
Okinawa.

343
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,120
Where's that?

344
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,000
My country.

345
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,800
China here.

346
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,600
Japan here.

347
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,680
Okinawa here.

348
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,200
Did you go to school for this?

349
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,480
Father teach.

350
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,600
Was he a gardener?

351
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,320
Fisherman.

352
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,640
A fisherman.

353
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,560
These are really beautiful.

354
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,760
Come, you try.

355
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,720
I don't know how to do this stuff.

356
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,480
- Sit down.
- I may mess it up or something.

357
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,960
Close eyes.

358
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,800
Trust.

359
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,880
Concentrate.

360
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,120
Think only tree.

361
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,560
Make a perfect picture
down to last pine needle.

362
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,080
Wipe your mind clean.
Everything but the tree.

363
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,560
Nothing exists in whole world...

364
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,920
...only tree.

365
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,200
You got it?

366
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,000
Open eyes.

367
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,760
Remember picture?

368
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,960
Yeah.

369
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,360
Make like picture.

370
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,760
Just trust the picture.

371
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,000
How do I know my picture's the right one?

372
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,800
If come from inside you,
always the right one.

373
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Hi.

374
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,240
Hi, Ma, come on in.

375
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,840
- You fixed your bike.
- Mr. Miyagi fixed it.

376
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,560
Great, thank you.

377
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,720
- How much do we owe you?
- No, please.

378
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,080
My pleasure.

379
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,840
That's very nice.

380
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,400
Hi, champ.

381
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,880
Hey.

382
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,880
- What are you doing?
- I am trimming my baby tree.

383
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,720
<i>Bonsai tree.</i>

384
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,400
<i>Bonsai tree.</i>

385
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,720
<i>Bonsai.</i>

386
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,320
<i>Bonsai.</i>

387
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,360
They're beautiful.

388
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,200
Mr. Miyagi learned it in Okinawa.
That's where he's from.

389
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,360
Really?

390
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,960
They're so delicate.

391
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,040
For me?

392
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,200
No, I couldn't.

393
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,400
Please, hurt feelings.

394
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,560
That's very nice, thank you.

395
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,360
- Welcome.
- I know just where it will go.

396
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,880
Come on, it's getting late.

397
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,080
- I will be up in a half hour.
- No, now. School tomorrow.

398
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,840
- Thank you for everything.
- You're welcome.

399
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,400
Don't forget tree.

400
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,960
Must practice.

401
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,960
Thank you.

402
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,120
<i>- Sayonara.
- Sayonara.</i>

403
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,320
- Goodnight.
- Thanks again. See you.

404
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,720
Ma, he gave you the nicest one.
This guy is something else.

405
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,840
You saw what he did to my bike.
This guy is great.

406
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,200
- Happy Halloween. You like?
- Yeah, that's nice.

407
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,040
Passed school today. Lots happening.

408
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,040
What's the matter? You're not going?

409
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,120
No.

410
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,680
How come?

411
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,360
I am not into dancing that much.

412
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,440
I don't feel like it, anyway.

413
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,000
You're too much by self. Not good.

414
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,160
I am not by myself.

415
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,160
I am with you.

416
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,600
To make honey, young bee
need young flower, not old prune.

417
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,440
I don't have a costume, anyway.

418
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,640
If have costume...

419
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,240
...you go?

420
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,920
If I went as the Invisible Man.

421
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,280
Invisible Man?

422
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,800
You know, so no one would see me.

423
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,200
There's Daniel.

424
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,000
- Where?
- In the shower.

425
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,440
- How do you know?
- I just know.

426
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,680
May I?

427
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,440
- I don't know what she sees in him.
- She must be into fungus.

428
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,560
Help me, my flower needs water.

429
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,520
You have come to the right place, stranger.

430
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,240
- I have never danced in a shower.
- A friend of mine made this for me.

431
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,720
Isn't it great?

432
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,560
Where have you been hiding?

433
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,520
I haven't been hiding.

434
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,560
- I haven't seen you around.
- You been looking?

435
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,480
- Sort of.
- Sort of?

436
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,120
I thought you were still angry with me.

437
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,680
- Why?
- Because of what I said last time I saw you.

438
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,680
I have been thinking a lot about that.

439
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,280
I should learn to mind my own business.

440
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,440
No, I think you're right about facing things.
I feel the same way.

441
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,000
I just kind of forgot for a while.

442
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,040
- Thanks for reminding me.
- You're welcome.

443
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,680
He thinks he can do
whatever he wants to people.

444
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,960
- Who?
- Johnny.

445
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,560
I'd love to see him get some
of his own medicine.

446
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,640
What goes around comes around.

447
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,720
- I'd love to be there when it does.
- Me, too.

448
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,680
You want to go outside?

449
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,960
You talked me into it.

450
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:51,360
- That chicken is wild!
- That guy's using real eggs!

451
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,880
He's great!

452
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,360
No!

453
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,240
Johnny!

454
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,640
Johnny!

455
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,680
- Got that number rolled?
- In a minute.

456
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,040
I am going to get the guys. Hurry up.

457
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,600
Shit!

458
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,960
Move, man!

459
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,840
Johnny, what's up?

460
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,440
Get out of my way!

461
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,200
- What's wrong?
- It's coming around.

462
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,480
Get up!

463
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,200
Get out of my way!

464
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,000
What the hell are you doing?

465
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,160
Get out of the way!

466
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,800
You ain't going nowhere.

467
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,560
You little wimp!

468
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,200
You couldn't leave well enough alone,
could you, little twerp?

469
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,240
No, you had to push it.
Well, now you're going to pay!

470
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,960
Where are you going, sweetheart?

471
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,280
How about a front kick, Johnny?

472
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,680
Get him up.

473
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,840
- He's had enough.
- Shut up!

474
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,600
- He can't even stand up.
- That don't mean squat.

475
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,920
- Johnny, he's had enough.
- I will decide when he's had enough.

476
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,800
What's wrong with you, Johnny?

477
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,880
- An enemy deserves no mercy.
- Right!

478
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,000
You're crazy, man!

479
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,480
Get him!

480
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,000
<i>Daniel-san.</i>

481
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,480
Come.

482
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,440
Leave on.

483
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,160
- It stinks. What is it?
- Smell bad, heal good.

484
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,880
- Where did Spider-Man go?
- Who?

485
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,680
The guy who bailed me out.
Where'd he go?

486
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,600
What, you?

487
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,240
- No way.
- Why "no way"?

488
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,400
- Because...
- Because, old man?

489
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,720
Have tea.

490
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,400
Feel better.

491
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,040
Why didn't you tell me?

492
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,400
- Tell you what?
- That you do karate.

493
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,480
- You never ask.
- Where'd you learn it?

494
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,040
Father.

495
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,560
I thought he was a fisherman.

496
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,160
In Okinawa, all Miyagi know two things:

497
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,560
Fish and karate.

498
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,720
Karate come from China, 16th century.

499
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,360
<i>Called "te," hand.</i>

500
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,440
Much later...

501
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:58,960
...Miyagi ancestors call "karate,"
empty hand.

502
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,280
I always thought it came
from Buddhist temples.

503
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,040
You, too much TV.

504
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,000
That's what my mother tells me.

505
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,880
- Have you ever taught anyone?
- No.

506
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,960
Would you?

507
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,520
- It depend.
- On what?

508
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,960
Reason.

509
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,360
How's revenge?

510
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,880
You look for revenge that way,
start by digging two graves.

511
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,040
At least I'd have company, right?

512
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,440
Fighting always last answer to problem.

513
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,280
Mr. Miyagi, I don't think
you understand my problem.

514
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,440
Miyagi understand problem perfect.

515
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,320
Your friend all karate student?

516
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,120
Friends? Yeah, those guys.

517
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,680
Problem attitude.

518
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,720
The problem is I keep getting
my ass kicked.

519
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,520
Because boys have bad attitude.

520
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,720
Karate for defence only.

521
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,120
That's not what these guys are taught.

522
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,160
I can see.

523
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,400
No such thing bad student,
only bad teacher.

524
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,080
Teacher say, student do.

525
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,880
Great, that solves everything.

526
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,920
I will go to the school and straighten it out
with the teacher.

527
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,680
Now use head
for something other than target.

528
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,880
- I was only kidding.
- Why kidding?

529
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,480
I get killed if I show up there.

530
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,880
Get killed anyway.

531
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,920
Would you go with me?

532
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,680
No, I can't.

533
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,000
Why? You said it was a good idea.

534
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,840
For you, good idea.

535
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,720
For me, good idea no get involved.

536
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,160
But you're already involved.

537
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,720
- Very sorry.
- What?

538
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,520
Thanks for nothing then.

539
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,680
Like I didn't have enough problems already.

540
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,520
Now I have got to carry your weight, too.
Don't do me any more favours.

541
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,880
<i>- Daniel-san.
- What?</i>

542
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,560
Okay, I go.

543
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,720
- Excellent, Mr. Miyagi.
- Miyagi.

544
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,880
Miyagi.

545
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,040
What kind of belt do you have?

546
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,800
Canvas.

547
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,120
You like?

548
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,600
J.C. Penney. $3.98.

549
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,280
I meant...

550
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,560
In Okinawa a belt means
no need rope hold up pants.

551
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,040
That's funny.

552
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,760
<i>- Daniel-san.
- What?</i>

553
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,840
Karate here.

554
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,240
Karate here.

555
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,280
Karate never here.

556
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,160
You understand?

557
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,120
I think so.

558
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,880
<i>Goodnight, Daniel-san.</i>

559
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,360
Goodnight, Mr. Miyagi. Miyagi!

560
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,840
Tomorrow morning?

561
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,760
10:00.

562
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,240
Thanks for helping me out
with my friends out there.

563
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,400
- Good morning, Mr. Miyagi.
- How do you feel?

564
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,640
- A little sore.
- You know how drive?

565
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,720
Yeah, I do.

566
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,720
- No, I am not very good at it.
- Me neither.

567
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,720
I don't have a licence.

568
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,240
Me neither.

569
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,760
I guess it's okay then.

570
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,320
You lose concentration
in a fight and you're dead meat!

571
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,520
<i>- Yes, Sensei.
- What?</i>

572
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,720
<i>Yes, Sensei!</i>

573
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,360
Get up!

574
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,800
Give me 60 pushups on your knuckles.

575
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,920
Combat!

576
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,560
Brown. Robertson.

577
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,200
On guard.

578
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,160
Point. Round kick.

579
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,600
What are you looking at? Finish him!

580
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,760
Return.

581
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,000
Prepare.

582
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,400
We do not train to be merciful, here.
Mercy is for the weak.

583
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,960
Here, on the street, in competition...

584
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,960
...a man confronts you, he is the enemy.

585
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,680
An enemy deserves no mercy.
What is the problem, Mr. Lawrence?

586
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,680
Come on, let's forget this.

587
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,200
Wait, not yet.

588
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,920
Class, we have visitors. Fall in behind me.

589
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,760
I hear you jumped
some of my students last night.

590
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,480
Afraid the facts mixed up.

591
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,680
Are you calling him a liar?

592
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,880
No call no one nothing.

593
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,120
What are you here for, old man?

594
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,320
Come ask leave boy alone.

595
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,560
Can't the boy take care of himself?

596
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,360
One-to-one problem, yes.

597
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,080
Five-to-one problem, too much ask anyone.

598
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,440
Is that what's bothering you, the odds?

599
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,640
Well, we can fix that.

600
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,320
<i>- Feel like matching, Mr. Lawrence?
- Yes, Sensei!</i>

601
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,640
No more fighting.

602
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,040
<i>This is a karate dojo, not a knitting class.</i>

603
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,240
You don't come in here,
drop a challenge and leave, old man.

604
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,920
You get your boy on the mat,
or you and I will have a problem.

605
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,160
<i>Too much advantage, your dojo.</i>

606
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,520
Name a place.

607
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,400
Tournament.

608
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,600
You have got real nerve, old man.

609
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,920
But I think we can accommodate you.

610
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,360
Can't we, Mr. Lawrence?

611
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,960
<i>Yes, Sensei.</i>

612
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,720
Fall in.

613
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,520
Ask one more small request.

614
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,560
Make it fast.

615
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,800
Ask leave boy alone to train.

616
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,280
You're a pushy little bastard, ain't you?

617
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,280
But I like that.

618
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:37,000
No one touches the prima donna
until the tournament.

619
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,320
<i>- Is that understood?
- Yes, Sensei!</i>

620
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,560
But if you don't show...

621
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,520
...then it's open season...

622
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,720
...on him...

623
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,640
...and you.

624
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,680
I can't believe this.

625
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,200
- I cannot believe this!
- What?

626
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,480
What you just got me into.
You said you'd make things better.

627
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,640
- I did.
- How?

628
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,400
How? I saved you two months of beating.

629
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:35,000
Great, now I have got something
to look forward to.

630
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,800
How much further is your house?

631
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,280
Other side tracks.

632
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,640
Are you in the oil business, too?

633
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,120
Not everything is as seem.

634
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,680
Reminds me of Newark.
What are we going to do here?

635
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,200
Start training.

636
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,120
Much work be done.

637
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,360
Tournament here before you know it.

638
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,440
That's what I am afraid of.

639
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,360
That teacher was really wacko.
You really think I can beat that guy?

640
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,880
No matter.

641
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:13,280
Wacko teacher attitude rest in fist.

642
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,240
Stupid, but fact of life.

643
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,080
Win, lose, no matter.

644
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,960
You make good fight, earn respect.

645
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,800
- Then nobody bother.
- They will bury me where I fall.

646
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:28,640
Either way, problem solved.
Wait right here.

647
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,560
This is great.

648
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,640
- I forgot to give you this back.
- You keep.

649
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,920
Thanks a lot.

650
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,520
- Ready?
- Yeah, I guess so.

651
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,360
<i>Daniel-san, must talk.</i>

652
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,200
Walk on road.

653
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:07,920
Walk right side, safe. Walk left side, safe.

654
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:13,640
Walk middle, sooner or later,
you get squished just like grape.

655
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,280
Here, karate same thing.

656
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:20,920
Either you karate do, yes, or karate do, no.

657
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,560
You karate do, "guess so," just like grape.

658
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,240
Understand?

659
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,000
Yeah, I understand.

660
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,440
Ready?

661
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,760
Yeah, I am ready.

662
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,280
Yes.

663
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,840
First make sacred pact.

664
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:47,600
I promise teach karate. That's my part.

665
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:54,840
You promise learn. I say, you do,
no questions. That's your part.

666
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,400
Deal?

667
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,520
It's a deal.

668
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,720
First wash all the cars, then wax.

669
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:12,560
- Why do I have to...
- Remember deal. No questions.

670
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,680
Yeah, but...

671
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:20,280
Wax on right hand. Wax off left hand.

672
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:23,400
Wax on, wax off.

673
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,080
Breathe in through nose,
out through mouth.

674
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,760
Wax on, wax off.

675
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,440
Don't forget to breathe. Very important.

676
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,360
Wax on, wax off.

677
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,840
Wax on, wax off.

678
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,600
Where did these cars come from?

679
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,080
Detroit.

680
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,400
Wax on...

681
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,040
...right hand make circle.

682
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,760
Wax off, left hand make circle.

683
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,960
Wax on, wax off.

684
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:14,200
Breathe in, breathe out.

685
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,360
Wax on, wax off.

686
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,480
Mr. Miyagi, I am finished.

687
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,320
You want to check these out?

688
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,840
Mr. Miyagi?

689
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,040
Mr. Miyagi?

690
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,080
Hello?

691
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,080
I have been looking all over for you.
Where have you been?

692
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,360
- I don't believe it.
- What?

693
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,720
- Where are you going?
- I am going to find that idiot.

694
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,360
- No, it's been taken care of.
- Until next time.

695
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:57,240
- There isn't going to be a "next time."
- There they are.

696
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:01,320
Watch this.
Hey, guys, it's good to see you.

697
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,400
Sorry about your eye, Johnny.
Your shoulder okay, Tommy?

698
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,440
You guys be careful not to step
in front of any more buses.

699
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,640
<i>Hold it. Remember what Sensei said?
Wait for the tournament.</i>

700
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,040
It must be "Take a Worm for a Walk" week.

701
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,040
You did all that damage?

702
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,760
When you make a wish in the shower,
it always comes true.

703
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,880
- I should have kept my mouth shut.
- No, we have got an agreement.

704
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,520
Yeah? What's that?

705
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:30,160
They agreed not to beat up on me
and I promised not to bleed on them.

706
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,560
- I don't believe you.
- What can I do, moan and groan?

707
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,920
- Anybody else would.
- Who'd listen anyway?

708
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,040
Me.

709
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,520
Really?

710
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:45,440
- You feel like listening on Saturday night?
- Sure.

711
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,760
Great! So Saturday night...

712
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,200
...we will go out, we will have a good time.
We will do whatever.

713
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,040
- Is that your address?
- You got it.

714
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,360
Where is this?

715
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,920
- I have got to go.
- Okay.

716
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,880
I will talk to you later. Great.

717
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,840
All right.

718
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:12,560
Mr. Harris, can I talk to you?
LaRusso. Third period history class.

719
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:17,720
I wanted to tell you, I really got a lot
out of that lecture about the Indians.

720
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:23,000
I was telling my buddies about it.
Could you give us a quick review?

721
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,520
- Sure, I am free this period.
- Great for me.

722
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,040
No, I got to go.

723
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,760
I guess that leaves you and me,
but that's all right.

724
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,240
You can tell them about it later.

725
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:38,360
The Plains Indians
were a very primitive tribe...

726
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,120
Come on, Casanova.

727
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,840
- Hi, how are you doing?
- Good.

728
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,160
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

729
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,000
You have got company.

730
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,400
Those are my parents.
Come on, I want you to meet them.

731
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,920
Great.

732
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,240
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi, Dad.

733
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,600
This is Daniel LaRusso.

734
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,600
- My parents, Mr. And Mrs. Mills.
- How do you do, Daniel?

735
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,640
- Hello, Daniel.
- Nice to meet you.

736
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,640
- Where are you going?
- I don't know. Where are we going?

737
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,480
I don't know. Wherever you want.

738
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,680
- Golf N' Stuff?
- We're going to Golf N' Stuff, then.

739
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:53,480
Don't worry about that.
Weren't you going to have that fixed?

740
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,440
I am. I was. I will.

741
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,320
- You live in Encino, Daniel?
- Encino? No.

742
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,800
- Where do you live?
- Out, like Reseda.

743
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:08,920
- And that's your mother?
- Yeah, that's her.

744
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,240
Hi!

745
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,360
She's waiting for us.
We'd better go. Nice to meet you.

746
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,040
- Not too late, sweetheart.
- Okay, Dad.

747
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:24,920
- Hi, Mrs. LaRusso. I am Ali.
- Hi, Ali. Call me Lucille.

748
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,640
- That's a beautiful house you have.
- Thanks.

749
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,240
- Can you drive a stick?
- Yeah.

750
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,640
Put it into second, let it roll,
and when I say "pop it," pop it.

751
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:42,840
"Pop it."

752
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,200
Don't worry, it's all under control.

753
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,800
She's cute. It happens a lot.

754
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:58,200
Okay, LaRusso, push! On, you huskies!

755
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,440
Okay, pop it!

756
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,400
We got it on the first!

757
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:25,000
I will pick you up at 11:00.
Please, don't be late. Have fun.

758
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:32,520
- Look at that slide.
- We will do that next time.

759
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,320
- Why next time?
- You need a bathing suit.

760
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,600
Oh, yeah. Bathing suits.

761
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:43,640
- Do you play hockey?
- Not professionally.

762
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,200
This is the best time
I have had since I have been here.

763
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:50,120
- We will have to do it again.
- Definitely.

764
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,400
Hey, good looking. How are you?

765
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,960
Good. This is cool.

766
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,960
- I just got it. You want a ride?
- Some other time.

767
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,080
- Are you sure?
- Daniel, this is Eddie. Eddie, Daniel.

768
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,920
- How are you doing, Daniel?
- Good.

769
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,080
- Hey, Ali! How's it going?
- Hi, guys.

770
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:08,200
- How are you doing?
- Want to come with us?

771
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,640
No, I don't think so.
You guys have a good time.

772
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,960
- We will make room.
- I will call you tomorrow.

773
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,600
Your little friend can come,
if it's okay with his mommy.

774
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,920
Hi, kids.

775
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:22,960
- Hey, Mommy, can Daniel come for a ride?
- I really like your car.

776
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,360
- You could have gone.
- I didn't want to.

777
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:39,200
- It's no big deal.
- If I'd wanted to go, I would have.

778
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,280
It makes no difference to me.
Do what you want, I don't care.

779
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:15,880
This is beautiful.

780
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:24,480
Mr. Miyagi, this is great.
You have got real fish in there.

781
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,600
This is outrageous.

782
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:33,560
I thought Chung Lee's restaurant was nice.
You beat his act.

783
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,360
This is paradise. Did you do this yourself?

784
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,320
Are these bongos?

785
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,440
No, I got it.

786
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,960
<i>"Hare Krishna"</i>

787
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,040
<i>Daniel-san, you much humour.</i>

788
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:49,680
- What are these?
- Japanese sander.

789
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,040
- What do you do with them?
- Funny you should ask.

790
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,360
Right circle.

791
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,200
Left circle.

792
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:05,120
- It'd be easier going back and forth.
- But you go circle.

793
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,720
Right circle.

794
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,760
Left circle.

795
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,760
Right circle, left circle.

796
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:16,800
Breathe in, breathe out.

797
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:20,600
Right circle, left circle.

798
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,360
Right circle, left circle.

799
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,760
Breathe in, breathe out.

800
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:33,080
Whole floor. Right circle, left circle.

801
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,280
Right circle.

802
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,560
Left circle.

803
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:41,080
Breathe in, breathe out.

804
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,520
Very good.

805
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,240
Splinters all gone.

806
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,760
I am finished.

807
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,600
Mr. Miyagi, I am beat.

808
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,840
My shoulders.

809
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,200
Good.

810
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,880
Go home, get rest.

811
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,960
Come morning, start early. 6:00.

812
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,520
Wouldn't a fly swatter be easier?

813
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:17,160
Man who catch fly with chopsticks,
accomplish anything.

814
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,680
Did you ever catch one?

815
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:22,440
Not yet.

816
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,520
Could I try?

817
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,200
If wish.

818
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,200
Hey, Mr. Miyagi, look!

819
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,240
You, beginner luck.

820
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:11,760
I guess that means I can accomplish
anything, right? No sweat.

821
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,520
First you accomplish paint fence.

822
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,480
All in wrist.

823
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,800
Wrist up. Wrist down.

824
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:38,800
All in wrist. Up, down, long stroke.

825
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,840
Very good. Up, down.

826
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,280
No look me, look fence.

827
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:46,360
Up...

828
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,480
...down.

829
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:53,360
Bend the wrist. Downstroke, you bend.
See? Good.

830
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:56,920
Long stroke. Up, down. Very good.

831
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,240
Bend your knees. Down.

832
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,440
Up.

833
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,400
<i>Very good, Daniel-san.
Don't forget to breathe.</i>

834
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,280
In, out.

835
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:07,320
Up...

836
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,520
...down.

837
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,760
Up, down.

838
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,120
Up...

839
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:16,880
...down.

840
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:18,560
Up...

841
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,160
...down.

842
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,440
<i>Very good, Daniel-san.</i>

843
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,760
Up, down.

844
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,360
Up...

845
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,960
...down.

846
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:42,440
Small board, left hand.
Big board, right hand.

847
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:46,040
- I am almost done.
- All of fence.

848
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,600
Big board, right hand.
Small board, left hand.

849
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,920
Up, down.

850
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,880
Up, down.

851
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:19,760
All finished.

852
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,760
It looks pretty good, huh?

853
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:23,880
Both sides?

854
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,000
Not yet.

855
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:47,960
<i>Daniel-san. Very good job.</i>

856
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,440
Come morning. Start early.

857
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:05,440
Up...

858
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,200
...down.

859
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,040
Up...

860
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,640
...down.

861
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,240
Damn it! I can't believe this.

862
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,480
Missed spot.

863
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:04,080
What spot?

864
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:08,000
- You didn't tell me you were going fishing.
- You not here when I go.

865
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,640
- Maybe I wanted to go.
- You karate training.

866
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:14,440
I am what? I am being your goddamn slave!

867
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,480
- We made a deal here.
- So?

868
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:19,360
"So"? You're supposed to teach
and I am supposed to learn.

869
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:22,560
Four days I have been busting my ass,
I haven't learned a thing.

870
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:25,800
- You learn plenty.
- I have learned to sand your decks.

871
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:29,080
I have waxed your car, I paint your house,
paint your fence.

872
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:32,920
- Not everything is as seems.
- Bullshit! I am going home, man.

873
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:35,520
<i>Daniel-san!</i>

874
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,320
- What?
- Come here.

875
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:47,640
- Show me sand the floor.
- I can't move my arm, all right?

876
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,920
What are you doing?

877
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:00,600
What are you doing?

878
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:06,560
- Now show me sand the floor.
- How did you do that?

879
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:07,800
Show!

880
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:12,400
Sand the floor?

881
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,000
Stand up.

882
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,520
Show me sand the floor.

883
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,080
Sand the floor.

884
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,040
Sand the floor.

885
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,720
Big circle. Sand the floor.

886
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,160
Sand the floor.

887
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:38,840
Now show me wax on, wax off.

888
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:49,400
- Wax on, wax off.
- "Wax on, wax off!"

889
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:50,560
Wax on...

890
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,200
...wax off.

891
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:55,440
Concentrate. Look in my eyes.

892
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,920
Lock your hand, thumb inside.

893
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:59,840
Wax on...

894
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:01,800
...wax off.

895
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,320
Wax on...

896
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:05,760
...wax off.

897
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:08,280
Wax on.

898
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,600
Wax off.

899
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,120
Show me paint the fence. Up, down.

900
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:19,560
Up.

901
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,120
Down.

902
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:22,520
Up.

903
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:23,960
Down.

904
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:26,920
Other side. Look eye. Always look eye!

905
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,520
Show me paint the house. Side, side.

906
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,920
Lock wrist. Side, side.

907
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,000
Side, side.

908
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,960
Show me wax on, wax off.

909
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,640
Show me paint the fence.

910
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,680
Show me side, side.

911
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,400
Show me sand the floor.

912
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:26,440
Look eye! Always look eye.

913
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,480
Come back tomorrow.

914
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:18,720
Learn balance. Go water, kick.
Learn balance.

915
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:00,000
What were you doing on those stumps?

916
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:03,160
- Called crane technique.
- Does it work?

917
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:06,040
If do right, no can defence.

918
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:07,840
Could you teach me?

919
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,880
First learn stand, then learn fly.

920
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:15,160
<i>- Nature rule, Daniel-san, not mine.
- Who taught you?</i>

921
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:18,880
- Father teach.
- You must have had some father.

922
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,040
- Look, the kid's got a pet Nip.
- He know any tricks, kid?

923
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,800
Excuse, please. Boy cold, must leave.

924
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,400
Kindly remove bottle.

925
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:37,480
Kindly do it yourself, Mr. Moto.

926
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,840
How did you do that?

927
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:52,760
Don't know. First time.

928
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,000
Hey, you!

929
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:11,840
- Hey, not bad. Definitely varsity material.
- You let me.

930
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:17,760
Should we try the slide on Friday?
I could pick you up about 7:00.

931
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:20,840
I am having dinner with my parents
at the country club.

932
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,560
I will be done by 9:30. Meet me out front.

933
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:25,000
- Is that cool?
- Yeah.

934
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,440
Johnny, over here!

935
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,320
- What's the matter?
- It's that little voice again.

936
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:33,880
Pretend you're deaf.
Encino Oaks Country Club. 9:30.

937
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:36,520
Friday? Great.

938
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:39,000
- Hi, Ali.
- "Hi, Ali."

939
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,040
I have got to be nuts.

940
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:57,320
Okay, here. Stop. Throw anchor.

941
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,640
Good. Stand bow.

942
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,040
Not bow. Bow!

943
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:13,280
- Up!
- What, up front?

944
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:14,960
Make block.

945
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:18,000
Left, right. Up, down.

946
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:21,840
Side, side. Breathe in, breathe out.

947
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,040
And no scare fish.

948
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,680
When do I learn how to punch?

949
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,280
Better learn balance.

950
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,440
Balance is key.

951
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:40,560
Balance good, karate good.
Everything good.

952
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:45,040
Balance bad, better pack up, go home.
Understand?

953
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:47,760
Yeah, I understand.

954
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:54,840
Did you ever get into fights
when you were a kid?

955
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:56,400
Plenty.

956
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:01,520
- It wasn't like the problem I have, right?
- Fighting, fighting. Same, same.

957
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,480
But you knew karate.

958
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,720
Someone always know more.

959
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:09,840
There were times
when you were scared to fight?

960
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:14,480
Always scared. Miyagi hate fighting.

961
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,080
- But you like karate.
- So?

962
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:21,040
Karate's fighting, you train to fight.

963
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,600
That what you think?

964
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:29,760
No.

965
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,280
Then why train?

966
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:35,200
So I won't have to fight.

967
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,840
Miyagi have hope for you.

968
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:42,520
- When do I learn how to punch?
- Learn how punch...

969
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,520
...when learn how keep dry!
- No!

970
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:52,640
<i>Daniel-san, you're all wet behind ear!</i>

971
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,400
Are you crazy?

972
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:57,000
You're crazy.

973
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,280
Trouble with Johnny?

974
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:23,200
- You two lovebirds having problems?
- We're not lovebirds.

975
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:27,080
- What time is it?
- It's about 9:40.

976
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:31,000
- I have got to go.
- Do you have a date?

977
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:36,160
- With whom?
- A friend.

978
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:38,400
Not that boy from Reseda.

979
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:40,480
Yeah, he's from Reseda.

980
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,880
He's a nice guy. It's no big deal.

981
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:46,440
Honey, you have monopolised
the best-looking man here long enough.

982
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:49,040
- Hi.
- Hi.

983
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:54,400
I have been thinking,
maybe we can call a truce.

984
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,840
I am not at war. Excuse me.

985
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:00,000
Could we please finish the dance?

986
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:03,120
Don't you ever do that to me again!

987
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:56,360
I didn't know you were a singer.
How are you doing?

988
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:01,360
<i>Daniel-san, come inside.</i>

989
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:05,200

- Japanese blues.

- Anniversary.

999
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:54,080
Whose anniversary?

1000
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:58,840
Is this your wife?
I didn't know you were married.

1001
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:04,200
- Damn beautiful, don't you think?
- Yeah, she's pretty.

1002
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:08,320
First time I saw her...

1003
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:12,000
...was cane field, Hawaii.

1004

Beautiful.

1005
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,680
Damn good cane cutter, too.

1006
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,240
Where is she now?

I tell you what Miyagi think,
I think you dance around too much.

I think you talk too much.
I think you no concentrate enough.

Lots of work to be done.

You didn't have to do this.

What is this? I have no idea.

Mr. Miyagi, this is great.

Not matter what Miyagi think.
Miyagi not fighting.

You sure know how to make
a guy feel confident.

1075

You trust the quality of what you know,
not quantity.

You don't have to give me anything.
You have given me enough already.

- Oh, wow.

1103

Oh, boy.

1106

Just remember:

1107
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:24,960
A licence never replace eye, ear and brain.

1108
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:31,280
What matter?

1109
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:35,680
I am just scared.

...pretty okay, too.

1122
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:32,590
Go.

1123
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:35,760
Go find the balance.

1124
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:47,680
<i>- Banzai, Daniel-san!
- Banzai!</i>

1125
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,120
I give up. Don't shoot! No.

1126
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:38,480
- Don't leave me. I am wounded.
- Good, maybe you will die.

1127
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:46,080
- I just wanted to apologise.
- Fine, you apologised.

1128
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:49,480
- I got my licence.
- Whoop-dee-doo.

1129
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:53,040
- What's with you?
- What do you expect? Cartwheels?

1130
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:59,440
I just expected some courtesy,
or is that only for people with fancy cars?

1131
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:04,160
Can't you take a hint?

1132
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:10,240
Does the truth hurt?

1133
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:12,680
- You really think that's it?
- I know it is.

1134
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:14,920
- You're wrong.
- I bet I am wrong.

1135
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:19,000
I didn't go out with you
because of a car or where you live.

1136
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,640
Okay, while we're on the subject,
why did you then?

1137
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,000
Why did you?

1138
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,280
I thought maybe you and me
were different.

1139
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:30,720
I am from Reseda, you're from the hills,
that's how we're different.

1140
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:33,920
Admit that you just can't handle
the situation the way it is.

1141
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,880
I can handle it fine. You can't.

1142
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,600
What makes you so sensitive?
She's never been anything but nice to you.

1143
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:45,120
- She used me to make him jealous.
- She doesn't even like him.

1144
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:48,760
Who could tell, the way their faces
were stuck together at the country club?

1145
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:52,920
Right, you didn't stick around
for the exciting conclusion.

1146
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:55,240
- What, his hand on her ass?
- Her right hook.

1147
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:58,280
You think she sprained her wrist
doing her nails?

1148
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:02,720
- She hit him?
- That's an understatement.

1149
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:09,000
- Why didn't she say something?
- She shouldn't have to, should she?

1150
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:29,040
Hey, slugger.

1151
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:36,200
Look, I am a jerk.

1152
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,000
You are a jerk.

1153
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:43,560
So, am I forgiven?

1154
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:47,280
I don't hear anything.

1155
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:49,600
Sounds like a "yes" to me.

1156
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:52,400
Come here.

1157
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,440
I guess you know
about the tournament tomorrow.

1158
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:07,200
Who doesn't?

1159
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:08,680
Dumb move, huh?

1160
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:11,000
Not necessarily.

1161
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:14,000
I don't have much of a cheering section.

1162
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:15,720
You got me.

1163
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:19,560
I will probably get killed in the first match.

1164
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:22,560
So, we will leave early.

1165
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:40,200
- I have got something to show you.
- What?

1166
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:47,320
- How do you like it?
- Is it yours? Are you serious?

1167
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:50,720
- It's beautiful.
- It sure is.

1168
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:52,880
- My God.
- Here you go.

1169
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,880
- You want me to drive?
- It's the '80s!

1170
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:00,400
- To start, you push that button.
- You're incredible.

1171
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:04,680
Press the clutch.
Get the lights, no that one.

1172
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:09,160
Good. Down is first. Let it out slow.

1173
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,720
Hold on!

1174
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:15,960
This is awesome. How fast does it go?

1175
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:17,760
Let's not find out.

1176
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:23,840
- What belt are you?
- Why matter?

1177
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,720
This is open division,
it's only for brown belt or above.

1178
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:28,480
Boy black belt.

1179
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:33,360
You'd better hustle. They're starting.
Down the hall, to your left.

1180
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:35,640
- I will see you inside.
- Okay.

1181
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:38,560
Excuse me, Mr. Referee.

1182
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:41,800
This is not "Miyaji." Miyagi.

1183
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:43,600
Miyagi.

1184
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:45,240
Okay, thank you.

1185
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:58,120
Well, look who we have here.
Our little friend Danielle.

1186
01:41:58,120 --> 01:41:59,720
Hello, Danielle.

1187
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:02,800
What's the matter?
Mommy not here to dress you?

1188
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:07,120
I am talking to you, punk.
Come on, make a move.

1189
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:09,000
Hey, save it for the ring.

1190
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:10,200
Come on!

1191
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:12,760
- All right.
- Let's go.

1192
01:42:13,480 --> 01:42:14,520
Come on.

1193
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:16,720
Points or no points...

1194
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:19,040
...you're dead meat.

1195
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:21,880
I said out!

1196
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:25,560
Dead meat.

1197
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:31,600
Way to go, I think he's going to cry.

1198
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:46,520
<i>The winner of the first match
in the open division is Rufus Schneider.</i>

1199
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:50,720
- Mr. Miyagi.
- Hurry. Tournament starting.

1200
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:51,520
Where'd we get this?

1201
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:52,320
<i>Daniel LaRusso...</i>

1202
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:55,680
<i>- Buddha provide.
- ... please report to Ring 3.</i>

1203
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:57,480
- Where's Ring 3?
- Over there.

1204
01:42:57,480 --> 01:43:00,960
Hold it! Sorry, teachers and students only.

1205
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:03,160
He doesn't speak English...

1206
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:07,160
...and I can't understand his instructions
without her. She's his translator.

1207
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:13,120
- What did he say?
- You remind him of his uncle in Tokyo.

1208
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:18,120
- I guess it's okay. What?
- He says you're very kind.

1209
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,200
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

1210
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:25,080
- What are the rules here?
- I don't know.

1211
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:27,760
First time you, first time me.

1212
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:31,480
I figured you knew about this stuff.
I figured you went to these before.

1213
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:32,720
Great, I am dead.

1214
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:36,440
- You told me you fought a lot.
- For life, not for points.

1215
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,920
Everything above your waist is a point.

1216
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:42,440
You can hit the head, sternum,
kidneys, ribs. Got it?

1217
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:44,680
- I hope so.
- You can do it.

1218
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,280
When are you jerks going to grow up?

1219
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:56,400
- Where am I, over here at this one?
- Number 3.

1220
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:58,520
- What's that guy kneeling for?
- I don't know.

1221
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:01,600
- Don't you know anything?
- Don't get hit.

1222
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:13,720
Face. Bow. On guard.

1223
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:15,640
Fight.

1224
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:23,080
Back on your line.

1225
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:25,200
Be tough, Daniel.

1226
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:29,000
Come on, be tough.

1227
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:35,600
Remember your defence. Points coming.
Concentrate. Focus power.

1228
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,880
Remember balance. Make good fight.

1229
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:42,880
Run out of the ring once more,
it will cost you a point.

1230
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,760
On guard. Ready?

1231
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:54,920
That's one, Daniel, come on.

1232
01:44:57,320 --> 01:44:58,720
One more!

1233
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:00,880
Move back on your line.

1234
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:03,960
That's one point, round kick.

1235
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:08,080
Daniel, you're the best!

1236
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:25,640
You're dead!

1237
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:05,280
Point! Winner!

1238
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:53,840
Winner!

1239
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:58,640
- It must be tight.
- Yeah, right there.

1240
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:02,000
- I never thought I'd get this far.
- Make two of us.

1241
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,720
Wouldn't it be great if I won?

1242
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:07,560
- It'd be great if you survive.
- What do you mean "survive"?

1243
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:11,920
- I am fine as long as I don't move.
- You have got to move now, they're starting.

1244
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:15,120
Are they starting now?
What do you mean "survive"?

1245
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:19,480
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1246
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:22,880
<i>... may I have your attention, please.</i>

1247
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:28,080
<i>This is the first semi-final match
of the afternoon.</i>

1248
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:35,320
<i>Defending champion,
John Lawrence of the Cobra Kai.</i>

1249
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:39,280
<i>Two-time winner of the All Valley
Under-18 Golden Trophy.</i>

1250
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:43,920
<i>He will be facing Darryl Vidal
of the Locust Valley Karate Club.</i>

1251
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:49,040
<i>Three points wins.
Contestants, please come to the ring.</i>

1252
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:51,480
<i>Good luck, gentlemen.</i>

1253
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:55,240
Go get him, Johnny.

1254
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:57,560
Show him what you're made of.

1255
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,880
Face me, gentlemen. Bow.

1256
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:03,240
Face. Bow. Ready?

1257
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:06,000
Come on, Johnny.

1258
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:10,600
Fast, Johnny. Come on. Do it.

1259
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:17,040
One point, Lawrence.

1260
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:27,800
Lawrence, back on the line.

1261
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:29,160
Way to go!

1262
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:30,800
Are you all right?

1263
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:32,200
I am okay.

1264
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:35,920
One point, Lawrence.

1265
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:42,360
Good point, Johnny!

1266
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:46,000
Point Lawrence. Winner!

1267
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:54,280
<i>The next semi-final determines
who will face the defending champion.</i>

1268
01:49:54,720 --> 01:50:01,320
<i>Daniel LaRusso, of the Miyagi-do Karate.</i>

1269
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:03,960
Bobby...

1270
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:06,360
...I want him out of commission.

1271
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:08,840
<i>Sensei, I can beat this guy.</i>

1272
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:14,200
- I don't want him beaten.
- But I will be disqualified!

1273
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:16,200
Out of commission.

1274
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:22,440
<i>Let's go, fellas. Good luck.</i>

1275
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:33,760
Do what you got to do, Bobby!

1276
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:41,800
Face. Bow. Ready?

1277
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:45,040
Watch the control, gentlemen. Ready?

1278
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:57,000
- I am sorry! I didn't mean it.
- My leg!

1279
01:50:57,960 --> 01:51:01,840
- Mr. Miyagi, my leg hurts.
- Miyagi here.

1280
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:08,360
<i>Bobby Brown of the Cobra Kai
has been disqualified...</i>

1281
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:13,280
<i>... for excessive and deliberate contact.
Under rule 41-2...</i>

1282
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:17,800
<i>... Daniel LaRusso has 15 minutes
to return to the ring.</i>

1283
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:20,160
<i>If he is unable to return...</i>

1284
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:24,360
<i>... John Lawrence will win by default.</i>

1285
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:30,800
I will inform the judges.

1286
01:51:32,120 --> 01:51:33,760
You did well out there, young man.

1287
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:39,480
Damn it!

1288
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:41,680
Honey, forget it.

1289
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:43,960
You were great.

1290
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:46,400
I couldn't be prouder.

1291
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:48,520
It was just bad luck.

1292
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:51,280
You would have won
if they hadn't cheated.

1293
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:53,640
Just leave me alone for a minute.

1294
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:55,160
We will be outside.

1295
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:01,760
Mr. Miyagi...

1296
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:06,440
...you think I had a chance of winning?

1297
01:52:06,440 --> 01:52:08,080
Win, lose, no matter.

1298
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:10,000
That's not what I mean.

1299
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:16,520
Had good chance.

1300
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:20,280
Can you fix my leg with that thing you do?

1301
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:22,720
No need fight anymore.

1302
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:26,160
- You proved a point.
- What, that I can take a beating?

1303
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:30,000
Every time I see those guys,
they will know they got the best of me.

1304
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:36,000
I will never have balance that way,
not with them, not with Ali...

1305
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:40,840
...not with me.

1306
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:46,320
What?

1307
01:52:49,240 --> 01:52:50,560
Close eye.

1308
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:15,040
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the moment we have been waiting for.</i>

1309
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:20,320
<i>Daniel LaRusso's going to fight?</i>

1310
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:23,000
<i>Daniel LaRusso's going to fight!</i>

1311
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:27,280
<i>This is what it's all about, folks.
You know it.</i>

1312
01:53:28,240 --> 01:53:29,960
<i>How's the leg, son?</i>

1313
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,120
<i>All right. What a man!</i>

1314
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:36,760
<i>The final match to determine...</i>

1315
01:53:36,760 --> 01:53:39,760
<i>... who will emerge victor and champion...</i>

1316
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:44,000
<i>... of the All Valley Under-18
Karate Championship.</i>

1317
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:47,200
<i>Daniel LaRusso, Miyaji-do Karate...</i>

1318
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:49,680
<i>Miyagi-do.</i>

1319
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:52,000
<i>Miyagi-do Karate.</i>

1320
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,280
<i>... versus John Lawrence of the Cobra Kai.</i>

1321
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:58,240
<i>Three points wins. Good luck, boys.</i>

1322
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:01,520
Come on, Daniel!
You have got this guy. You can do it.

1323
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:10,120
Face me. Bow.

1324
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:13,400
Face off. Bow. Ready?

1325
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:23,800
That's okay, Johnny.

1326
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:25,480
Lawrence, return.

1327
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:28,640
One point, LaRusso.

1328
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:29,960
You're dead.

1329
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:37,760
Daniel, you have got him!

1330
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:47,080
<i>Point! Jab! That's two for LaRusso.</i>

1331
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:50,800
<i>Time out. Go to your sensei.</i>

1332
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,520
Turn, kneel.

1333
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:54,960
Johnny, you're a creampuff!

1334
01:54:56,040 --> 01:54:57,160
Sweep the leg.

1335
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:01,520
You have a problem with that?

1336
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:04,720
<i>No, Sensei.</i>

1337
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:08,040
No mercy.

1338
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:17,800
One more!

1339
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:21,440
Two points LaRusso. Lawrence nothing.

1340
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:32,600
<i>One point Lawrence. 2-1, LaRusso.</i>

1341
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:56,040
Kick to the side. One point Lawrence. 2-2.

1342
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:05,640
Out of bounds. Come back in.

1343
01:56:07,720 --> 01:56:09,200
Destroy him, Johnny!

1344
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:11,480
Come on, Daniel, you can do it!

1345
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:34,920
Come on, Daniel. Be strong.

1346
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:38,840
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I am okay.

1347
01:56:39,160 --> 01:56:42,440
<i>Whoever wins the next point
will be our new champion.</i>

1348
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:48,720
Finish him, Johnny!

1349
01:56:56,920 --> 01:56:59,640
It's over, Johnny! You did it!

1350
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:04,840
Are you okay? Can you go on?

1351
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:08,000
Get him a body bag!

1352
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:13,000
Warning for illegal contact to the knee.

1353
01:57:18,360 --> 01:57:20,160
Finish him!

1354
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:30,240
Winner!

1355
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:42,480
<i>The new champion!</i>

1356
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:46,920
- You're all right, LaRusso.
- Thanks a lot.

1357
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:54,880
Mr. Miyagi, we did it. All right!
