503
00:42:40,353 --> 00:42:43,523

-告诉你什么? -你会空手道

509

父亲
Father.

510
00:43:23,355 --> 00:43:25,399
我以为他是渔夫
I thought he was a fisherman.

511
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,152
在冲绳 所有宫城都会两件事
In Okinawa, all Miyagi know two things:

512
00:43:29,694 --> 00:43:31,655
捕鱼和空手道
Fish and karate.

513
00:43:32,114 --> 00:43:34,950
空手道来自中国 16世纪
Karate come from China, 16th century.

514
00:43:35,659 --> 00:43:37,702
称为"唐" "手"
Called "te, " hand.

515
00:43:38,495 --> 00:43:39,871
很久以后
Much later...

516
00:43:40,497 --> 00:43:45,627
宫城祖先称为"空手道" "空手"
... Miyagi ancestors call "karate, " empty hand.

517
00:43:47,129 --> 00:43:50,132
我一直以为那是从佛教寺庙那里来的
I always thought it came from Buddhist temples.

518
00:43:50,966 --> 00:43:53,009
你电视看多了
You, too much TV.

519
00:43:54,052 --> 00:43:56,096
我妈也这么说
That's what my mother tells me.

520
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:03,270
-你教过谁吗? -没
-Have you ever taught anyone? -No.

521
00:44:03,353 --> 00:44:04,396
你会教吗?
Would you?

522
00:44:05,188 --> 00:44:07,065
-要看 -看什么?
-It depend. -On what?

523
00:44:07,566 --> 00:44:08,567

Reason.

524
00:44:09,693 --> 00:44:11,069
复仇如何?
How's revenge?

525
00:44:13,321 --> 00:44:17,868
丹尼尔桑 你这么想复仇 不如先挖好两个坟墓
You look for revenge that way, start by digging two graves.

526
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:21,163
至少我有伴 对吧?
At least I'd have company, right?

527
00:44:21,371 --> 00:44:24,708
打架不是解决问题的办法
Fighting always last answer to problem.

528
00:44:25,709 --> 00:44:28,712
不想冒犯你 宫城先生 但我认为你不了解我的问题
Mr. Miyagi, I don't think you understand my problem.

529
00:44:28,837 --> 00:44:32,007
宫城先生完全了解问题
Miyagi understand problem perfect.

530
00:44:33,175 --> 00:44:37,095
你的朋友都是空手道学生?
Your friend all karate student?

531
00:44:37,888 --> 00:44:40,015
"朋友"? 是哦 那些人
Friends? Yeah, those guys.

532
00:44:40,098 --> 00:44:41,641
问题在於态度
Problem attitude.

533
00:44:42,225 --> 00:44:45,854
不 问题在於我每隔一天就被人揍
The problem is I keep getting my ass kicked.

534
00:44:46,104 --> 00:44:49,816
因为那些人态度恶劣
Because boys have bad attitude.

535
00:44:50,817 --> 00:44:53,153
空手道只是为了抵R
Karate for defence only.

536
00:44:54,404 --> 00:44:56,698
那些人可不是这样学的
That's not what these guys are taught.

537
00:44:57,282 --> 00:44:58,825
看得出来
I can see.

538
00:44:59,576 --> 00:45:03,246
没有坏学生 只有坏老师
No such thing bad student, only bad teacher.

539
00:45:03,789 --> 00:45:06,041
老师教 学生做
Teacher say, student do.

540
00:45:07,334 --> 00:45:08,960
好 那就解决我的问题了
Great, that solves everything.

541
00:45:09,044 --> 00:45:13,173
我只要去学校 跟老师讨论这事就好 没问题
I'll go to the school and straighten it out with the teacher.

542
00:45:13,673 --> 00:45:17,094
这主意不错
Now use head for something other than target.

543
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:21,473
-我是开玩笑的 -为什么开玩笑?
-I was only kidding. -Why kidding?

544
00:45:22,057 --> 00:45:24,184
因为如果我去那里 我会被揍死
I get killed if I show up there.

545
00:45:25,143 --> 00:45:26,686
反正你总会被揍死
Get killed anyway.

546
00:45:32,484 --> 00:45:34,027
你会跟我去吗?
Would you go with me?

547
00:45:35,695 --> 00:45:36,905
不 不行
No, I can't.

548
00:45:37,531 --> 00:45:39,324
为什么? 你说那是好主意不是吗?
Why? You said it was a good idea.

549
00:45:39,449 --> 00:45:41,243
对你来说是个好主意
For you, good idea.

550
00:45:41,326 --> 00:45:44,246
对我 不要干涉才好
For me, good idea no get involved.

551
00:45:44,371 --> 00:45:46,790
但你已经干涉…
But you're already involved.

552
00:45:46,957 --> 00:45:48,417
-非常抱歉 -什么?
-Very sorry. -What?

553
00:45:54,506 --> 00:45:56,550
不谢你哦
Thanks for nothing then.

554
00:45:57,008 --> 00:45:59,845
好像我问题还不够多似的
Like I didn't have enough problems already.

555
00:46:01,388 --> 00:46:04,891
现在我还得为你的事负责 老兄 请你别再帮我了
Now I've got to carry your weight, too. Don't do me any more favours.

556
00:46:05,016 --> 00:46:07,352
-丹尼尔桑? -什么?
 -Daniel -san. -What?

557
00:46:11,022 --> 00:46:13,275
好 我去
Okay, I go.

558
00:46:15,569 --> 00:46:18,655
-太棒了 宫城先生 这太棒了 -宫城
-Excellent, Mr. Miyagi. -Miyagi.

559
00:46:19,823 --> 00:46:20,907
宫城
Miyagi.

560
00:46:21,283 --> 00:46:23,160
你是什么带的?
What kind of belt do you have?

561
00:46:23,952 --> 00:46:24,995
帆布的
Canvas.

562
00:46:25,287 --> 00:46:26,371
你喜欢?
You like?

563
00:46:26,997 --> 00:46:28,957
-洁西潘尼百货 3美金98分 -我不是问那种皮带
-J.C. Penney. $3.98. -I hadn't mean that belt

564
00:46:29,666 --> 00:46:30,709
我是指…
I meant...

565
00:46:30,876 --> 00:46:34,129
在冲绳 皮带表示 不需要绳子来绑紧裤子
In Okinawa a belt means no need rope hold up pants.

566
00:46:37,007 --> 00:46:38,800
真好笑
That's funny.

567
00:46:38,967 --> 00:46:40,594
-丹尼尔桑 -什么?
 -Daniel -san. -What?

568
00:46:42,429 --> 00:46:44,848
空手道在这里

569
00:46:46,683 --> 00:46:48,393
空手道在这里

570
00:46:49,186 --> 00:46:51,563
空手道从不在这里
Karate never here.

571
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:54,566
你懂?
You understand?

572
00:46:56,568 --> 00:46:57,652
我想是
I think so.

573
00:46:59,863 --> 00:47:01,573
晚安 丹尼尔桑

00:47:15,754 --> 00:47:19,674
谢谢你把我从朋友那里救出来
Thanks for helping me out with my friends out there.

578
00:47:33,188 --> 00:47:37,567
-早安 宫城先生 -早安 丹尼尔桑 你今早觉得怎样?
-Good morning, Mr. Miyagi. -How do you feel?

579
00:47:37,692 --> 00:47:41,988
-有点酸痛 -你会开车?
-A little sore. -You know how drive?

580
00:47:42,114 --> 00:47:44,157
对啊 我会
Yeah, I do.

581
00:47:45,242 --> 00:47:49,371
-我开得不好 宫城先生 -我也不好
-No, I'm not very good at it. -Me neither.

582
00:47:49,496 --> 00:47:51,456
我也没有驾照
I don't have a licence.

583
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:53,041
我也没有
Me neither.

584
00:47:53,875 --> 00:47:56,712
那我想这样就没问题了
I guess it's okay then.

585
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:05,974
杀!

586
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:18,455
12月19日报名参加!

587
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,293
18届全谷区空手道冠军赛

588
00:48:34,249 --> 00:48:36,918
你在打架中失神 你就死定了
You lose concentration in a fight and you're dead meat!

589
00:48:37,044 --> 00:48:38,170
-是 老师 -什么?
 -Yes, Sensei. -What?

590
00:48:38,295 --> 00:48:39,421
是 老师!
Yes, Sensei!

591
00:48:41,048 --> 00:48:42,174
起来
Get up!

592
00:48:44,134 --> 00:48:46,803
去用指节做60下伏地挺身
Give me 60 pushups on your knuckles.

593
00:48:50,932 --> 00:48:52,142
搏斗!
Combat!

594
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,279
布朗 罗伯森
Brown. Robertson.

595
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:16,416

597
00:49:24,007 --> 00:49:26,218
你在看哪里? 打败他!
What are you looking at? Finish him!

598
00:49:28,136 --> 00:49:29,513
回来
Return.

599
00:49:32,474 --> 00:49:33,934
预备
Prepare.

600
00:49:37,354 --> 00:49:40,607
我们不是来训练心软的 心软是弱者的行为
We do not train to be merciful, here. Mercy is for the weak.

601
00:49:41,483 --> 00:49:44,319
这里 路上 或在竞赛中
Here, on the street, in competition...

602
00:49:44,444 --> 00:49:46,405
跟你对抗的就是敌人
... a man confronts you, he is the enemy.

603
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:50,283
对敌人不可以心软 劳伦斯先生 你有什么问题?
An enemy deserves no mercy. What is the problem, Mr. Lawrence?

604
00:49:53,787 --> 00:49:55,497
走吧 算了
Come on, let's forget this.

605
00:49:56,248 --> 00:49:58,125
等等 还没
Wait, not yet.

606
00:50:00,293 --> 00:50:03,046
各位 我们有客人 在我身后排好
Class, we have visitors. Fall in behind me.

607
00:50:10,762 --> 00:50:13,306
我听说你昨晚击倒了我的几个学生
I hear you jumped some of my students last night.

608
00:50:13,932 --> 00:50:16,143
恐怕你弄错了
Afraid the facts mixed up.

609
00:50:16,893 --> 00:50:18,437
你说劳伦斯先生是骗子吗?
Are you calling him a liar?

610
00:50:18,937 --> 00:50:20,731
没说谁是什么
No call no one nothing.

611
00:50:21,022 --> 00:50:23,066
老头子 你来这里做什么?
What are you here for, old man?

612
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:25,360
请你放这孩子一马
Come ask leave boy alone.

613
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,739
怎么? 他不能解决自己的问题吗?
Can't the boy take care of himself?

614
00:50:28,905 --> 00:50:30,615
一对一的问题 可以
One -to -one problem, yes.

615
00:50:31,241 --> 00:50:34,494
五对一的问题 太过份
Five -to -one problem, too much ask anyone.

616
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:36,955
你是因此而不爽吗? 因为人多?
Is that what's bothering you, the odds?

617
00:50:37,456 --> 00:50:39,249
很好解决呀 劳伦斯先生
Well, we can fix that.

618
00:50:39,666 --> 00:50:42,044
-想打斗吗? -是 老师!
 -Feel like matching, Mr. Lawrence? -Yes, Sensei!

619
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:43,420
不要打
No more fighting.

620
00:50:43,545 --> 00:50:45,922
这是空手道道场 不是刺绣课
This is a karate dojo, not a knitting class.

621
00:50:46,089 --> 00:50:49,259
你不能来我道场 撂下挑战就走人 老头子
You don't come in here, drop a challenge and leave, old man.

622
00:50:50,093 --> 00:50:53,096
让这小子上场 否则我们就有大问题了
You get your boy on the mat, or you and I will have a problem.

623
00:50:53,221 --> 00:50:56,475
太占优势 你的道场
Too much advantage, your dojo.

624
00:50:57,476 --> 00:50:58,935
说个地方
Name a place.

625
00:50:59,644 --> 00:51:00,896
锦标赛
Tournament.

626
00:51:05,484 --> 00:51:08,403
你胆子真不小 老头
You've got real nerve, old man.

627
00:51:09,821 --> 00:51:11,865
但我想我们可以接受
But I think we can accommodate you.

628
00:51:12,616 --> 00:51:14,409
对吧 劳伦斯先生?
Can't we, Mr. Lawrence?

629
00:51:14,618 --> 00:51:16,078
是 老师
Yes, Sensei.

630
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:17,913
去排队
Fall in.

631
00:51:22,626 --> 00:51:25,003
再请求一件小事
Ask one more small request.

632
00:51:25,754 --> 00:51:27,130
快说
Make it fast.

633
00:51:27,506 --> 00:51:30,509
不要打扰男孩好让他受训
Ask leave boy alone to train.

634
00:51:31,718 --> 00:51:34,137
你这个逼迫人的混蛋
You're a pushy little bastard, ain't you?

635
00:51:34,262 --> 00:51:36,223
不过我喜欢
But I like that.

636
00:51:40,143 --> 00:51:43,230
好 锦标赛前 不准有人碰那个吹牛皮的
No one touches the prima donna until the tournament.

637
00:51:43,355 --> 00:51:46,691
-了解吗? -是 老师!
 -Is that understood? -Yes, Sensei!

638
00:51:48,527 --> 00:51:50,070
但如果你没出现…
But if you don't show...

639
00:51:51,613 --> 00:51:53,156
那就别怪我们…
... then it's open season...

640
00:51:55,242 --> 00:51:56,493
对他和你…
... on him...

641
00:51:58,286 --> 00:51:59,538
不客气
... and you.

642
00:52:26,189 --> 00:52:27,733
我不敢相信
I can't believe this.

643
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,360
-什么? -你把我弄进这种事
-I cannot believe this! -What?

644
00:52:30,444 --> 00:52:33,780
你说你会替我解决的
What you just got me into. You said you'd make things better.

645
00:52:33,905 --> 00:52:36,032
-我做啦 -哪算?
-I did. -How?

646
00:52:36,366 --> 00:52:39,953
哪算? 我让你少挨两个月的揍
How? I saved you two months of beating.

647
00:52:40,704 --> 00:52:43,707
棒透了 我真是等不及 现在我总算有事情可以期待了
Great, now I've got something to look forward to.

648
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:50,797
到你家还要多久?
How much further is your house?

649
00:52:51,673 --> 00:52:53,383
另一条小路
Other side tracks.

650
00:52:53,633 --> 00:52:55,844
什么 你也插手石油业吗?
Are you in the oil business, too?

651
00:52:56,803 --> 00:52:59,473
不是什么都能以外貌决定的
Not everything is as seem.

652
00:52:59,598 --> 00:53:02,142
这地方好像纽沃 我们来这里干嘛?
Reminds me of Newark. What are we going to do here?

653
00:53:02,267 --> 00:53:03,727
开始训练
Start training.

654
00:53:04,186 --> 00:53:05,729
很多事要做
Much work be done.

655
00:53:05,937 --> 00:53:08,065
比赛很快就到了
Tournament here before you know it.

656
00:53:08,523 --> 00:53:10,233
这正是我害怕的
That's what I'm afraid of.

657
00:53:14,654 --> 00:53:18,492
那老师是个疯子 你真认为我能打败他?
That teacher was really wacko. You really think I can beat that guy?

658
00:53:18,617 --> 00:53:20,077
不重要
No matter.

659
00:53:20,786 --> 00:53:23,622
疯老师的拳头就是他的态度
Wacko teacher attitude rest in fist.

660
00:53:23,789 --> 00:53:25,665
笨 但是真的
Stupid, but fact of life.

661
00:53:25,791 --> 00:53:27,584
输赢都不重要
Win, lose, no matter.

662
00:53:27,918 --> 00:53:30,587
你好好打 赢得尊重
You make good fight, earn respect.

663
00:53:30,879 --> 00:53:34,591
-那就没人来烦你 -我倒下了 他们会把我埋了
-Then nobody bother. -They'll bury me where I fall.

664
00:53:35,425 --> 00:53:39,638
总之问题是解决了 在这等
Either way, problem solved. Wait right here.

665
00:53:48,688 --> 00:53:49,981
好棒
This is great.

666
00:53:57,656 --> 00:54:01,535
-我昨晚忘记把这还你 -不 你留着
-I forgot to give you this back. -You keep.

667
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:02,869
谢谢
Thanks a lot.

668
00:54:03,703 --> 00:54:06,623
-好了吗? -嗯 我想是吧
-Ready? -Yeah, I guess so.

669

爱情测验 测验你的性感外貌

1155
01:41:39,976 --> 01:41:43,230
你们两个 别开枪! 不!
I give up. Don't shoot! No.

1156
01:41:45,107 --> 01:41:47,776
-别丢下我在这里 我受伤了 -或许你会死呢
-Don't leave me. I'm wounded. -Good, maybe you'll die.

1157
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:55,700
-我只是想跟你道歉 -好 你道过歉了
-I just wanted to apologise. -Fine, you apologised.

01:41:56,410 --> 01:41:59,246
-你知道 我拿到驾照了 -了不起呀
-I got my licence. -Whoop -dee -doo.

1159
01:41:59,538 --> 01:42:02,958
-你怎么了? -你要我为这个后空翻还是怎样?
-What's with you? -What do you expect? Cartwheels?

1160
01:42:04,126 --> 01:42:09,631
不 我只是要点礼貌罢了 还是开名车的人都没有礼貌?
I just expected some courtesy, or is that only for people with fancy cars?

1161
01:42:12,092 --> 01:42:14,553
她对你没兴趣啦!
Can't you take a hint?

1162
01:42:19,266 --> 01:42:20,892
怎么? 真话伤人吗?
Does the truth hurt?

1163
01:42:21,059 --> 01:42:23,437
-你真的这样认为的是吧? -我知道是这样

1164
01:42:23,562 --> 01:42:25,772
-你错了 -我当然错了
-You're wrong. -I bet I'm wrong.

1165
01:42:25,897 --> 01:42:30,026
我跟你约会 不是因为车子或你住的地方
I didn't go out with you because of a car or where you live.

1166
01:42:30,110 --> 01:42:32,779
说到这个 那你为何跟我约会?
Okay, while we're on the subject, why did you then?

1167
01:42:33,989 --> 01:42:35,240
为什么?
Why did you?

1168
01:42:35,407 --> 01:42:38,660
因为我以为你跟我很不一样
I thought maybe you and me were different.

1169
01:42:38,744 --> 01:42:42,247
我住罗瑟达 你住山庄 这就是我们不同之处
I'm from Reseda, you're from the hills, that's how we're different.

1170
01:42:42,330 --> 01:42:45,584
不是这个意思 何不承认…你无法接受事实?
Admit that you just can't handle the situation the way it is.

1171
01:42:46,001 --> 01:42:48,670
我可以 你却不行
I can handle it fine. You can't.

1172
01:42:49,838 --> 01:42:53,592
你干嘛那么神经质? 她一直对你都很好
What makes you so sensitive? She's never been anything but nice to you.

1173
01:42:53,759 --> 01:42:57,262
-她利用我去让那个谁吃醋 -她不喜欢他
-She used me to make him jealous. -She doesn't even like him.

1174
01:42:57,387 --> 01:43:01,058
原来在俱乐部那样亲吻 叫做不喜欢?
Who could tell, the way their faces were stuck together at the country club?

1175
01:43:01,183 --> 01:43:05,395
没错 你没待到令人兴奋的结局出现
Right, you didn't stick around for the exciting conclusion.

1176
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:07,814
-结局? 他伸手摸她屁股? -她的右勾拳
-What, his hand on her ass? -Her right hook.

1177
01:43:07,898 --> 01:43:10,984
你以为她扭伤手腕是修指甲造成的吗?
You think she sprained her wrist doing her nails?

1178
01:43:12,694 --> 01:43:15,614
-她打他了? -这样说还客气了
-She hit him? -That's an understatement.

1179
01:43:17,866 --> 01:43:22,162
-她为什么不说? -她没必要说吧?
-Why didn't she say something? -She shouldn't have to, should she?

1180
01:43:41,681 --> 01:43:43,058
嘿 拳击手
Hey, slugger.

1181
01:43:48,647 --> 01:43:50,524
听着 我是混蛋
Look, I'm a jerk.

1182
01:43:53,902 --> 01:43:55,529
你是混蛋
You are a jerk.

1183
01:43:56,655 --> 01:43:58,198
所以你原谅我了?
So, am I forgiven?

1184
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:02,077
我没听见
I don't hear anything.

1185
01:44:02,702 --> 01:44:04,496
听起来好像是
Sounds like a "yes" to me.

1186
01:44:05,038 --> 01:44:07,416
转过来
Come here.

1187
01:44:18,468 --> 01:44:21,012
我猜你知道明天的比赛
I guess you know about the tournament tomorrow.

1188
01:44:21,555 --> 01:44:22,848
谁不知道?
Who doesn't?

1189
01:44:23,014 --> 01:44:24,391
很蠢吧?
Dumb move, huh?

1190
01:44:25,016 --> 01:44:26,810
不一定
Not necessarily.

1191
01:44:27,394 --> 01:44:29,938
没人替我加油
I don't have much of a cheering section.

1192
01:44:30,272 --> 01:44:31,732
你有我呀
You got me.

1193
01:44:32,649 --> 01:44:35,736
反正我大概第一场比赛就会被打扁了
I'll probably get killed in the first match.

1194
01:44:36,903 --> 01:44:38,864
那我们就可以早点走了
So, we'll leave early.

1195
01:44:53,837 --> 01:44:57,257
-我有东西要给你看 -什么?
-I've got something to show you. -What?

1196
01:45:00,844 --> 01:45:04,681
-你喜欢吗? -你的? 你是当真的?
-How do you like it? -Is it yours? Are you serious?

1197
01:45:04,806 --> 01:45:08,226
-太漂亮了! -没错
-It's beautiful. -It sure is.

1198
01:45:08,351 --> 01:45:10,479
-噢 天哪! -钥匙拿去
-My God. -Here you go.

1199
01:45:10,604 --> 01:45:13,607
-你要我开? -这可是80年代耶
-You want me to drive? -It's the '80s!

1200
01:45:15,150 --> 01:45:18,320
-要启动 你要按那个钮 把钥匙插进去… -你真了不起
-To start, you push that button. -You're incredible.

1201
01:45:18,403 --> 01:45:22,783
现在踩离合器 开灯 不 那个
Press the clutch. Get the lights, no that one.

1202
01:45:23,408 --> 01:45:27,454
好 朝你往下的就是一档 现在慢慢放掉刹车
Good. Down is first. Let it out slow.

1203
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:30,123
这样就对了
Hold on!

1204
01:45:31,541 --> 01:45:34,544
好啦 来罗! 太棒了 可以开多快?
This is awesome. How fast does it go?

1205
01:45:34,961 --> 01:45:36,421
最好不要试
Let's not find out.

1206
01:45:40,008 --> 01:45:42,761
-你空手道什么带? -带?
-What belt are you? -Why matter?

1207
01:45:42,844 --> 01:45:45,764
有什么关系? 这是自由参赛 只有棕带以上才能参加
This is open division, it's only for brown belt or above.

1208
01:45:45,889 --> 01:45:47,599
他是黑带
Boy black belt.

1209
01:45:49,101 --> 01:45:52,687
你最好快点 要开始了 往里面走 然后左转
You'd better hustle. They're starting. Down the hall, to your left.

1210
01:45:53,021 --> 01:45:55,065
-里面见! -好
-I'll see you inside. -Okay.

1211
01:45:55,816 --> 01:45:58,110
抱歉 裁判先生
Excuse me, Mr. Referee.

1212
01:45:58,235 --> 01:46:01,488

This is not "Miyaji." Miyagi.

1213
01:46:01,571 --> 01:46:03,365
宫城
Miyagi.

1214
01:46:03,532 --> 01:46:05,075
好 谢谢
