1
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:52,242
Don't forget to tell Uncle Louie I left
the red wine and Parmesan in the fridge.

2
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:53,953
I love you. Bye-bye.

3
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,996
- 'Bye, Judy.
- Send me a picture.

4
00:00:56,124 --> 00:00:58,200
I'll be back soon. Don't worry about it.

5
00:00:58,335 --> 00:01:01,040
- Be careful, now.
- 'Bye.

6
00:01:02,422 --> 00:01:05,257
- Take it easy, now.
- 'Bye.

7
00:01:31,952 --> 00:01:34,822
"California, here we come"

8
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,702
What's wrong? Don't you like my singing?

9
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,119
I don't like the song.

10
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:42,210
You're going to love California.
You get up in the morning...

11
00:01:42,337 --> 00:01:44,211
...roll out of bed, plop, in the pool.

12
00:01:44,423 --> 00:01:45,454
Yeah, sure.

13
00:01:45,674 --> 00:01:49,588
You'll see. This isn't exactly a dump
we're moving to.

14
00:02:58,747 --> 00:03:03,208
Push, Daniel.
Give it all you've got, kid. Push!

15
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:07,538
Okay, we've got it. Come on.
Get in, hurry up.

16
00:03:10,384 --> 00:03:13,301
We did it again. Way to go!

17
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:43,120
Daniel, wake up.

18
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:47,669
Look off the starboard bow.
Paradise at last.

19
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,423
We made it.

20
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:52,841
Come on.

21
00:03:52,926 --> 00:03:54,207
This is it.

22
00:03:55,012 --> 00:03:57,550
This is the end of the line.

23
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,849
You're telling me.

24
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:03,223
Come on. All hands on deck.

25
00:04:05,022 --> 00:04:08,687
We've got to get this thing unloaded
before it sinks.

26
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:14,317
Look at those palm trees!
Damn, do you know what that means?

27
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:16,945
Yeah, watch out for falling coconuts.

28
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:21,109
- Wise guy. No more Newark winters.
- I like winters.

29
00:04:21,204 --> 00:04:24,158
Oh, you like sore throats?
You like frozen toes?

30
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:25,875
I don't like smog.

31
00:04:26,126 --> 00:04:29,412
- Did I tell you about the pool here?
- About 100 times.

32
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:31,830
Okay, so make it 101.

33
00:04:31,924 --> 00:04:36,550
Open your eyes, my darling son.
This is the Garden of Eden.

34
00:04:36,637 --> 00:04:40,302
Come on.
Listen, we're in apartment 20, okay?

35
00:04:40,474 --> 00:04:42,301
One flight up.

36
00:05:01,495 --> 00:05:03,571
- Are you okay?
- Don't worry about it.

37
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:05,331
- Let me help you up.
- Thanks.

38
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,498
I shouldn't have done that. It was stupid.

39
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:09,994
You must be the new people in 20, right?

40
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:11,166
Yeah, I guess so.

41
00:05:11,338 --> 00:05:13,746
- Freddy Fernandez, apartment 17.
- Daniel LaRusso.

42
00:05:13,924 --> 00:05:15,252
How you doing? Let me help.

43
00:05:15,342 --> 00:05:18,925
- No, it's fine. It's heavy, man.
- I got it.

44
00:05:19,471 --> 00:05:21,345
- Where are you from?
- New Jersey.

45
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:23,009
What are you doing out here?

46
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:26,427
My mom got a job with some company
out here. Rocket Computers.

47
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,263
Flight of the Future. I don't know.

48
00:05:28,355 --> 00:05:31,226
- I never heard of it.
- It's up and coming.

49
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:36,563
- Is this the only pool you've got?
- That's it. What was that, karate?

50
00:05:37,656 --> 00:05:40,028
- Yeah.
- Have you been doing it long?

51
00:05:40,117 --> 00:05:42,524
- Yeah, a while.
- Did you ever use it?

52
00:05:42,619 --> 00:05:45,490
- A couple of times.
- I bet you could kick some ass.

53
00:05:45,622 --> 00:05:48,576
I'd like to learn that.
Maybe you could teach me.

54
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:50,743
- Sure. That's cool. Anytime.
- Great.

55
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:53,956
This place is a dump.
You should go back to New Jersey.

56
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,750
How did you know where I was from?

57
00:05:56,842 --> 00:05:59,759
'Cause I'm from New Jersey.
I got a nose for my own.

58
00:05:59,886 --> 00:06:02,508
- Well what part?
- Parsippany.

59
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,676
- I never should've left.
- My Uncle Louie's from Parsippany.

60
00:06:05,851 --> 00:06:07,428
- Louie Martini?
- Louie LaRusso.

61
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,140
Louie LaRusso? Don't know him.

62
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:12,765
Hey, pup.

63
00:06:12,941 --> 00:06:14,981
How you doing? You thirsty?

64
00:06:15,736 --> 00:06:17,444
- She's crazy.
- What?

65
00:06:17,571 --> 00:06:20,276
- She's not playing with a full deck.
- She's nice.

66
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:23,402
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- I don't know. I guess nothing.

67
00:06:23,535 --> 00:06:26,536
We're having a beach party.
Want to come?

68
00:06:26,622 --> 00:06:29,741
- Sure, that's cool.
- I'll come get you in the morning.

69
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,124
Here's apartment 20.

70
00:06:32,294 --> 00:06:34,121
- Is it?
- Should I leave this here?

71
00:06:34,212 --> 00:06:37,048
- Yeah, thanks for the help.
- No problem.

72
00:06:37,132 --> 00:06:41,046
Nice meeting you. Take care.
See you tomorrow morning.

73
00:06:43,138 --> 00:06:47,005
Don't say anything about the pool.
I'll call first thing in the morning.

74
00:06:47,142 --> 00:06:49,894
Did you tell that old lady
where we were from?

75
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:52,137
Yes. Didn't she remind you of Aunt Tessy?

76
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:56,897
- More like Uncle Louie.
- I really think we're going to do good here.

77
00:06:56,985 --> 00:06:59,772
I have a very positive feeling.
I'm telling you, Daniel.

78
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:02,823
I just know it's going to work.
The faucet's broken.

79
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:06,988
The real estate lady said there's
a fix-it guy. See if you can find him.

80
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:09,820
What's that for?

81
00:07:10,415 --> 00:07:12,207
- Uncle Louie's dog.
- He's cute.

82
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:15,246
- I got invited to a party tomorrow.
- Great. You see?

83
00:07:15,462 --> 00:07:19,376
- But you wanted me to help you unpack.
- I don't remember saying that.

84
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:23,551
I must have had you mixed up
with somebody else.

85
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:24,924
Thanks, Ma.

86
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,258
Could you tell me
where the maintenance guy is?

87
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,014
Hey, pup.

88
00:07:33,105 --> 00:07:36,853
You go in through there,
turn left, not too far...

89
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:40,021
...then right, go inside, and you'll find him
on the left.

90
00:07:40,112 --> 00:07:41,654
So I go right then left?

91
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,196
No, left then right, then inside on the left.

92
00:08:04,511 --> 00:08:05,886
Hello?

93
00:08:12,936 --> 00:08:14,680
Are you the maintenance man?

94
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:18,807
We're the new people in apartment 20.

95
00:08:20,944 --> 00:08:23,566
The faucet's really leaking there.

96
00:08:29,703 --> 00:08:31,363
Could you come fix it?

97
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:37,042
Can I tell my mom when?

98
00:08:37,753 --> 00:08:38,998
When what?

99
00:08:40,923 --> 00:08:42,749
When you're going to fix the faucet.

100
00:08:42,883 --> 00:08:43,962
After.

101
00:08:44,801 --> 00:08:46,260
After what?

102
00:08:46,386 --> 00:08:48,046
After after!

103
00:09:38,814 --> 00:09:42,064
Could we have the ball, please?

104
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,728
Pretty good.

105
00:09:43,944 --> 00:09:45,319
Show-off.

106
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:52,234
Sorry. Hey, wait up.

107
00:09:54,871 --> 00:09:57,742
- Who's that blonde in the blue?
- The hills.

108
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,836
- What's the hills?
- Rich.

109
00:10:20,606 --> 00:10:23,441
- I think the blonde is looking at you.
- Yeah, right.

110
00:10:23,525 --> 00:10:27,689
- I think she has the hots for you.
- Who could blame her?

111
00:10:27,946 --> 00:10:30,484
- Why don't you make a move?
- No, I'm eating, man.

112
00:10:30,574 --> 00:10:33,326
- How can you think about eating?
- I'm hungry.

113
00:10:33,452 --> 00:10:37,864
- Maybe they ain't got no moves in Jersey.
- I got moves where I come from.

114
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,622
We've got more moves back there
than here, I'll tell you that much.

115
00:10:42,252 --> 00:10:44,411
Let's see 'em.

116
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,297
Come on, buddy. Go get her.

117
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:50,709
I'm going.

118
00:10:53,513 --> 00:10:56,051
- Lose something?
- I hope we're not bothering you.

119
00:10:56,141 --> 00:10:58,181
Hey, how do you juggle?

120
00:10:58,268 --> 00:11:03,263
It's pretty easy. You start on the knee.
You just go one.

121
00:11:03,398 --> 00:11:06,518
One at a time. Then you try two.
One, two.

122
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:11,110
And then three and four.
Try it. Just bring your leg up. Good!

123
00:11:18,372 --> 00:11:22,749
- That was awesome!
- Brew time. Who's for a warm one?

124
00:11:22,876 --> 00:11:24,074
No, I pass.

125
00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:27,584
Who are you kidding?
You're the ace degenerate.

126
00:11:27,881 --> 00:11:32,757
Ex-degenerate. Tomorrow I'm a senior.
I've got one year to make it all work.

127
00:11:32,844 --> 00:11:36,676
And that's what I'm gonna do.
Make it work, all of it.

128
00:11:36,765 --> 00:11:40,715
You must be a trendsetter, Johnny.
Everyone's doing something new.

129
00:11:40,811 --> 00:11:42,353
Take a right. Check it out.

130
00:11:44,648 --> 00:11:47,933
- Forget it, man. It's ancient history.
- Who told you, man?

131
00:11:48,986 --> 00:11:51,311
- I thought they broke up.
- She did, he didn't.

132
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,901
Come on, try it.

133
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:56,575
Watch this.

134
00:11:57,995 --> 00:11:59,821
I'll get it. I'll be right back.

135
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:20,175
- Ali, I want to talk to you.
- Leave me alone.

136
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:22,801
We've been over all this.
I don't want to talk.

137
00:12:23,145 --> 00:12:25,517
I want to talk to you, all right?

138
00:12:26,565 --> 00:12:30,313
- What is your problem?
- Just get out of here.

139
00:12:30,402 --> 00:12:34,186
- That won't solve anything.
- Give me my radio.

140
00:12:34,323 --> 00:12:35,900
I said, give me my radio.

141
00:12:36,158 --> 00:12:38,909
- You promise you'll talk to me?
- Yes, give me my radio.

142
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,704
- You just broke my radio!
- Yeah.

143
00:12:47,127 --> 00:12:48,835
Don't touch it, punk.

144
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:54,919
- What's going on?
- You want it?

145
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:05,560
Johnny, stop it.

146
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:12,402
- Stop it.
- I didn't do anything.

147
00:13:18,242 --> 00:13:20,068
You're a big man now, huh?

148
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:23,740
You started this. I just wanted to talk.

149
00:13:24,373 --> 00:13:28,038
- Leave him alone and we'll talk.
- Where did I hear that before?

150
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:31,957
How about you, hero? Had enough?

151
00:13:34,341 --> 00:13:37,425
- Now we're even.
- No mercy, man.

152
00:13:48,647 --> 00:13:52,016
Why don't you hit me?

153
00:13:52,109 --> 00:13:53,519
- It's your fault!
- It's not.

154
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,603
- It's your fault.
- Ever think it's yours?

155
00:13:55,779 --> 00:13:57,439
Why do you always have to fight?

156
00:13:57,531 --> 00:14:00,152
Bullshit. Get on your bikes, guys.

157
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:10,915
You sure pick cool people
to be friends with.

158
00:14:11,003 --> 00:14:13,042
Where'd you find this guy?

159
00:14:13,463 --> 00:14:16,001
Come on, let's go. He'll be all right.

160
00:14:25,142 --> 00:14:27,549
- Are you okay?
- Just leave me alone.

161
00:14:29,104 --> 00:14:32,473
- I'll help you.
- Leave me alone. I'm okay.

162
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:36,314
Come on, Ali. Let's go.
It's better if you leave him alone.

163
00:14:42,826 --> 00:14:44,653
Come on, let's go.

164
00:15:01,386 --> 00:15:03,046
Daniel!

165
00:15:07,434 --> 00:15:10,103
- How was the party?
- It was okay.

166
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:13,396
Must have been more than okay.
I didn't hear you come in.

167
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:16,352
- Any friend material?
- Some. I got to go.

168
00:15:16,568 --> 00:15:18,395
- Eat first.
- I'm not hungry.

169
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:21,690
- You need energy to be charming.
- I'm fine, I got energy.

170
00:15:21,865 --> 00:15:24,072
Do me a favour. Take off the glasses.

171
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,617
- Why?
- Because I asked you to.

172
00:15:27,037 --> 00:15:30,987
- It's California. It's the look.
- I want to see your baby browns.

173
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,580
- Come on with the baby browns.
- Are you on something?

174
00:15:35,212 --> 00:15:37,204
- I'm on Minute Maid.
- Why hide your eyes?

175
00:15:37,297 --> 00:15:39,967
- I'm not.
- Take off the glasses.

176
00:15:40,175 --> 00:15:41,373
Now!

177
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,881
My God! How did that happen?

178
00:15:50,352 --> 00:15:54,017
I hit a kerb with my bike.
I wore the glasses so you wouldn't worry.

179
00:15:54,147 --> 00:15:56,473
- It looks worse than it feels.
- Don't do that.

180
00:15:56,567 --> 00:15:59,733
- It doesn't hurt.
- Can you see? You want to stay home?

181
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,816
I've got to go.

182
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:05,006
- Hey, you guys, Freddy, how you doing?
- Hey, the karate kid.

183
00:17:05,135 --> 00:17:06,878
Let's see the moves.

184
00:17:07,304 --> 00:17:10,424
- He knows how to get his butt kicked.
- I already know that move.

185
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,558
Let's get out of here.

186
00:17:12,643 --> 00:17:13,757
Hey, think fast.

187
00:17:14,603 --> 00:17:16,679
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you doing?

188
00:17:16,772 --> 00:17:20,271
- Your eye.
- It looks worse than it feels. Believe me.

189
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,645
I hope so.

190
00:17:22,277 --> 00:17:24,768
I never got a chance to thank you.

191
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:28,405
That was nothing.
I'm just sorry about your radio.

192
00:17:28,951 --> 00:17:30,908
I'm more sorry about your eye.

193
00:17:30,994 --> 00:17:32,738
You should've just given it to him.

194
00:17:32,996 --> 00:17:34,538
Why? It wasn't his, right?

195
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:39,119
- Yeah, it wasn't his.
- We think alike already.

196
00:17:39,836 --> 00:17:41,461
You know what else we do alike?

197
00:17:44,258 --> 00:17:46,583
You've been practicing.

198
00:17:46,677 --> 00:17:49,464
- Cheerleaders, over here.
- I've got to go.

199
00:17:49,596 --> 00:17:52,170
- I'll see you.
- 'Bye.

200
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:55,931
- Hey, have you got a name?
- Ali with an "i."

201
00:17:57,145 --> 00:18:01,226
- What's your name?
- Daniel with an "I."

202
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:04,144
I'll see you later.

203
00:18:05,612 --> 00:18:07,154
Definitely.

204
00:18:41,773 --> 00:18:43,683
Get him, Bobby.

205
00:18:50,449 --> 00:18:51,907
Have a nice trip?

206
00:18:53,035 --> 00:18:55,276
Look what he's doing to Bobby.

207
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,199
Nobody hits me. I'm going to kill him.

208
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:03,201
- None of that on this team!
- He hooked me!

209
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,122
I said out of here!

210
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:07,833
Back to it. Let's go.

211
00:19:07,925 --> 00:19:11,128
This school sucks! It sucks.

212
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:38,151
52, 53, 54...

213
00:19:38,914 --> 00:19:42,994
55, 56, 57...

214
00:19:44,086 --> 00:19:46,374
- Fix faucet.
- Come on in.

215
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:48,124
It's the kitchen one.

216
00:19:48,715 --> 00:19:52,547
1, 2, 3...

217
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:53,917
Karate.

218
00:19:54,638 --> 00:19:58,505
- Yeah, 5, 6...
- Very good.

219
00:20:00,102 --> 00:20:04,431
- Learn from book?
- And a few months at the Y in Newark.

220
00:20:04,523 --> 00:20:07,228
9, 10...

221
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:12,190
...11, 12, 13...

222
00:20:16,034 --> 00:20:17,576
What happened to eye?

223
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:19,738
I fell off my bike.

224
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:26,202
Lucky no hurt hand.

225
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:47,938
- Ali with an "i." How are you doing?
- Good.

226
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:50,981
- Not too hungry today?
- Not really.

227
00:20:51,612 --> 00:20:53,320
Have some pie, I made it myself.

228
00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:58,282
- How do you like the valley?
- It hasn't been dull.

229
00:20:58,452 --> 00:20:59,780
Was Newark dull?

230
00:21:00,913 --> 00:21:02,786
How did you know I was from there?

231
00:21:02,873 --> 00:21:05,245
- I asked.
- Oh, really?

232
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:08,878
- Are you sitting with anybody?
- With you, if it's okay.

233
00:21:08,962 --> 00:21:11,536
- Sounds great to me. Want some milk?
- Thanks.

234
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:15,965
- Sorry about the soccer tryouts.
- Those are the breaks.

235
00:21:16,303 --> 00:21:19,138
Remember that guy you had trouble with
on the beach?

236
00:21:19,306 --> 00:21:22,805
- Yeah, King Karate?
- He's my ex-boyfriend.

237
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,137
That's good to know. What?

238
00:21:26,146 --> 00:21:27,688
Yeah, you're right. I know.

239
00:21:27,814 --> 00:21:30,732
- What are you doing?
- It's this little voice...

240
00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:33,735
...telling me I've got to be nuts
to be talking to you.

241
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,857
- That'll be $2.50.
- For both.

242
00:21:37,699 --> 00:21:41,697
- $3.75.
- It doesn't matter, anyway.

243
00:21:41,787 --> 00:21:44,408
- Why's that?
- Because it's over.

244
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,948
- Wait. How over?
- Weeks.

245
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,119
One week, five weeks?
How many weeks is "weeks"?

246
00:22:00,472 --> 00:22:04,552
- Fear does not exist in this <i>dojo</i>. Does it?
- No, <i>Sensei</i>!

247
00:22:04,643 --> 00:22:08,593
- Pain does not exist in this <i>dojo.</i> Does it?
- No, <i>Sensei</i>!

248
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:13,558
- Defeat doesn't exist in this <i>dojo</i>. Does it?
- No, <i>Sensei</i>!

249
00:22:13,694 --> 00:22:18,237
- Fear does not exist in this <i>dojo</i>. Does it?
- No, <i>Sensei</i>!

250
00:22:18,323 --> 00:22:22,819
- Pain does not exist in this <i>dojo.</i> Does it?
- No, <i>Sensei</i>!

251
00:22:22,995 --> 00:22:28,451
- Defeat doesn't exist in this <i>dojo</i>. Does it?
- No, <i>Sensei</i>!

252
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:29,740
Prepare.

253
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:37,004
- What do we study here?
- The way of the fist, sir!

254
00:22:37,384 --> 00:22:42,010
- And what is that way?
- Strike first, strike hard, no mercy!

255
00:22:42,222 --> 00:22:47,383
- I can't hear you.
- Strike first, strike hard, no mercy!

256
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:51,638
- Mr. Lawrence.
- Yes, <i>Sensei</i>.

257
00:22:52,691 --> 00:22:54,434
Warm them up.

258
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:12,668
Fighting positions. Jab punch.

259
00:23:13,086 --> 00:23:14,201
Ready.

260
00:23:23,388 --> 00:23:27,552
Guess what.
I'm going to be trained as a manager.

261
00:23:27,935 --> 00:23:29,595
Isn't that great?

262
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,346
The programme's two nights a week.

263
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:37,979
As soon as a spot opens up, I'm in.
The benefits are great.

264
00:23:38,487 --> 00:23:40,479
They pay for everything.

265
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,318
That's great.

266
00:23:45,202 --> 00:23:47,871
- What's the matter, Daniel?
- Nothing.

267
00:23:50,249 --> 00:23:54,116
Remember when you went to the country
and hated it 'cause you had no friends?

268
00:23:54,211 --> 00:23:55,622
What happened?

269
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,708
I got poison ivy.

270
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,713
You met Kevin and Kenny,
who became your best friends in the world.

271
00:24:04,846 --> 00:24:06,804
You've got to give it a try.

272
00:24:07,182 --> 00:24:09,424
I know it's hard.

273
00:24:10,018 --> 00:24:11,845
We're not quitters, are we?

274
00:24:12,229 --> 00:24:13,640
I guess not.

275
00:24:14,815 --> 00:24:17,899
- What's with the karate place?
- It sucks.

276
00:24:17,985 --> 00:24:20,820
Good. We couldn't afford it anyway.

277
00:24:21,613 --> 00:24:23,273
And the girl situation?

278
00:24:23,991 --> 00:24:26,564
- It's okay.
- Just okay?

279
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:30,030
To me it looks like
the whole world turned blonde.

280
00:24:30,581 --> 00:24:32,324
You got your eye on anybody?

281
00:24:35,502 --> 00:24:36,617
Cute?

282
00:24:36,795 --> 00:24:38,123
Not cute.

283
00:24:39,006 --> 00:24:43,050
- She's beyond cute.
- But she's blonde, right?

284
00:24:43,302 --> 00:24:46,836
- She's got blonde hair.
- Lucille, let's go, here they come.

285
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:50,631
- Is she as pretty as Judy?
- She buries Judy in a second.

286
00:24:50,726 --> 00:24:53,014
She buries Judy?

287
00:24:53,562 --> 00:24:57,606
Tell me about it later. I love you.
Careful how you ride home.

288
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:03,856
She's got an excellent smile.
She's really smart.

289
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,283
I'd say she's beautiful.
I think she's beautiful.

290
00:25:10,996 --> 00:25:12,989
I think she's something else.

291
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:16,706
She's hot. Definitely hot.

292
00:25:45,781 --> 00:25:50,490
- Looking for a shortcut to Newark?
- He wants to learn karate.

293
00:25:50,577 --> 00:25:55,156
Here's the first lesson: How to take a fall.
Don't think about the pain.

294
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,938
Damn bike! I hate this bike!

295
00:26:29,074 --> 00:26:32,277
I hate this frigging bike! Stupid bike!

296
00:26:33,745 --> 00:26:36,497
What's the matter?
Why did you throw your bike away?

297
00:26:36,582 --> 00:26:39,867
- Because I felt like it.
- Look at me when I'm talking to you.

298
00:26:40,002 --> 00:26:41,200
My God!

299
00:26:43,547 --> 00:26:46,417
Tell me what's going on.
Don't say another bike accident.

300
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,673
- What do you want to hear?
- The truth.

301
00:26:48,802 --> 00:26:51,471
No, all you want to hear
is how great it is here.

302
00:26:51,597 --> 00:26:54,266
Maybe for you, but it sucks for me.
I hate this place!

303
00:26:54,349 --> 00:26:58,014
I hate it, I want to go home!
Why can't we just go back home?

304
00:26:59,021 --> 00:27:00,563
Listen to me.

305
00:27:00,647 --> 00:27:03,434
I cannot help you
unless you tell me what's wrong.

306
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:05,019
I've got to take karate.

307
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,859
- You took karate.
- Not at the Y, at a good school.

308
00:27:09,031 --> 00:27:12,530
- Fighting doesn't solve anything.
- Neither does palm trees.

309
00:27:12,618 --> 00:27:14,160
That's not fair.

310
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:18,789
It wasn't fair coming out here
without asking me.

311
00:27:21,501 --> 00:27:22,664
You're right.

312
00:27:24,004 --> 00:27:25,332
I should've asked.

313
00:27:25,422 --> 00:27:29,206
I just want to go home.
I don't understand the rules here.

314
00:27:29,301 --> 00:27:32,421
Let's see if we can figure out
the rules together.

315
00:27:32,512 --> 00:27:35,716
- What about your bike?
- It's safer taking the bus.

316
00:27:35,807 --> 00:27:39,473
Why can't we just go home
and forget this place?

317
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:04,412
- I'll tell you everything he said.
- You'd better.

318
00:28:17,432 --> 00:28:18,595
How are you?

319
00:28:18,684 --> 00:28:22,681
- What happened to your forehead?
- It's terrible. A gigantic runaway zit.

320
00:28:22,771 --> 00:28:24,562
That's gross.

321
00:28:25,315 --> 00:28:29,016
Daniel, this is Susan.
What really happened?

322
00:28:29,111 --> 00:28:31,068
I got in a bike accident.

323
00:28:32,114 --> 00:28:35,068
What kind of bike do you have?
A Honda? Suzuki?

324
00:28:36,493 --> 00:28:38,402
It's a Miyagi Turbo.

325
00:28:38,495 --> 00:28:40,820
- Yeah?
- Oh, really?

326
00:28:40,914 --> 00:28:43,999
- We're going to the arcade. Want to come?
- Sounds great.

327
00:28:44,084 --> 00:28:46,789
There's this new game I want to show you.

328
00:28:50,632 --> 00:28:55,259
I forgot something.
I'll catch up with you guys in a minute.

329
00:28:55,345 --> 00:28:58,097
- Don't run away.
- I'm not running away from anything.

330
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:02,518
- We've got to deal with this.
- I'll deal with it my own way.

331
00:29:03,312 --> 00:29:05,518
- Daniel...
- Get off my case!

332
00:29:42,935 --> 00:29:46,185
Did you fix my bike?

333
00:29:46,605 --> 00:29:48,847
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

334
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:51,017
I really appreciate that.

335
00:29:53,195 --> 00:29:54,772
Are those real trees?

336
00:29:55,739 --> 00:29:58,230
You like see, come inside.

337
00:29:59,034 --> 00:30:00,149
Thanks.

338
00:30:08,335 --> 00:30:10,126
How did they get so small?

339
00:30:10,254 --> 00:30:11,831
I train.

340
00:30:12,047 --> 00:30:14,455
Clip here, tie there.

341
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,460
Did you learn this in Japan?

342
00:30:17,594 --> 00:30:18,839
Okinawa.

343
00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:20,127
Where's that?

344
00:30:20,806 --> 00:30:22,086
My country.

345
00:30:23,725 --> 00:30:25,006
China here.

346
00:30:25,394 --> 00:30:26,888
Japan here.

347
00:30:27,229 --> 00:30:29,020
Okinawa here.

348
00:30:31,066 --> 00:30:32,691
Did you go to school for this?

349
00:30:32,776 --> 00:30:34,056
Father teach.

350
00:30:34,778 --> 00:30:36,237
Was he a gardener?

351
00:30:36,863 --> 00:30:38,062
Fisherman.

352
00:30:38,198 --> 00:30:39,443
A fisherman.

353
00:30:40,659 --> 00:30:42,450
These are really beautiful.

354
00:30:43,287 --> 00:30:44,781
Come, you try.

355
00:30:44,913 --> 00:30:46,822
I don't know how to do this stuff.

356
00:30:46,915 --> 00:30:49,702
- Sit down.
- I may mess it up or something.

357
00:30:50,877 --> 00:30:52,288
Close eyes.

358
00:30:54,214 --> 00:30:55,245
Trust.

359
00:30:59,261 --> 00:31:00,541
Concentrate.

360
00:31:02,472 --> 00:31:04,963
Think only tree.

361
00:31:06,768 --> 00:31:10,636
Make a perfect picture
down to last pine needle.

362
00:31:12,065 --> 00:31:16,359
Wipe your mind clean.
Everything but the tree.

363
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:21,031
Nothing exists in whole world...

364
00:31:21,366 --> 00:31:23,489
...only tree.

365
00:31:25,787 --> 00:31:26,950
You got it?

366
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,868
Open eyes.

367
00:31:31,251 --> 00:31:32,745
Remember picture?

368
00:31:33,921 --> 00:31:35,035
Yeah.

369
00:31:35,964 --> 00:31:37,506
Make like picture.

370
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,426
Just trust the picture.

371
00:31:50,437 --> 00:31:52,809
How do I know my picture's the right one?

372
00:31:52,898 --> 00:31:56,765
If come from inside you,
always the right one.

373
00:32:31,353 --> 00:32:32,432
Hi.

374
00:32:33,188 --> 00:32:34,730
Hi, Ma, come on in.

375
00:32:36,275 --> 00:32:39,525
- You fixed your bike.
- Mr. Miyagi fixed it.

376
00:32:40,904 --> 00:32:42,363
Great, thank you.

377
00:32:43,407 --> 00:32:45,695
- How much do we owe you?
- No, please.

378
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:47,107
My pleasure.

379
00:32:47,452 --> 00:32:48,947
That's very nice.

380
00:32:51,373 --> 00:32:52,653
Hi, champ.

381
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:54,198
Hey.

382
00:32:55,335 --> 00:32:59,380
- What are you doing?
- I'm trimming my baby tree.

383
00:32:59,923 --> 00:33:01,299
<i>Bonsai</i> tree.

384
00:33:01,925 --> 00:33:03,088
<i>Bonsai</i> tree.

385
00:33:03,427 --> 00:33:04,458
<i>Bonsai.</i>

386
00:33:05,095 --> 00:33:06,126
<i>Bonsai.</i>

387
00:33:07,139 --> 00:33:08,253
They're beautiful.

388
00:33:08,348 --> 00:33:11,183
Mr. Miyagi learned it in Okinawa.
That's where he's from.

389
00:33:11,393 --> 00:33:12,424
Really?

390
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:14,097
They're so delicate.

391
00:33:19,192 --> 00:33:20,437
For me?

392
00:33:20,944 --> 00:33:22,652
No, I couldn't.

393
00:33:22,738 --> 00:33:24,979
Please, hurt feelings.

394
00:33:26,366 --> 00:33:28,240
That's very nice, thank you.

395
00:33:28,827 --> 00:33:31,199
- Welcome.
- I know just where it will go.

396
00:33:32,164 --> 00:33:33,788
Come on, it's getting late.

397
00:33:33,957 --> 00:33:37,160
- I'll be up in a half hour.
- No, now. School tomorrow.

398
00:33:38,295 --> 00:33:41,047
- Thank you for everything.
- You're welcome.

399
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,793
Don't forget tree.

400
00:33:46,219 --> 00:33:47,464
Must practice.

401
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,545
Thank you.

402
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,763
- <i>Sayonara.</i>
- <i>Sayonara.</i>

403
00:33:52,643 --> 00:33:55,134
- Goodnight.
- Thanks again. See you.

404
00:33:58,774 --> 00:34:01,775
Ma, he gave you the nicest one.
This guy is something else.

405
00:34:02,027 --> 00:34:05,028
You saw what he did to my bike.
This guy is great.

406
00:34:35,686 --> 00:34:39,849
- Happy Halloween. You like?
- Yeah, that's nice.

407
00:34:40,023 --> 00:34:42,810
Passed school today. Lots happening.

408
00:34:44,736 --> 00:34:46,943
What's the matter? You're not going?

409
00:34:47,072 --> 00:34:48,103
No.

410
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:49,730
How come?

411
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:52,490
I'm not into dancing that much.

412
00:34:53,996 --> 00:34:55,704
I don't feel like it, anyway.

413
00:34:57,791 --> 00:35:00,460
You're too much by self. Not good.

414
00:35:01,336 --> 00:35:02,747
I'm not by myself.

415
00:35:03,547 --> 00:35:04,827
I'm with you.

416
00:35:05,757 --> 00:35:10,466
To make honey, young bee
need young flower, not old prune.

417
00:35:11,388 --> 00:35:13,464
I don't have a costume, anyway.

418
00:35:14,182 --> 00:35:15,725
If have costume...

419
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,424
...you go?

420
00:35:18,061 --> 00:35:20,220
If I went as the Invisible Man.

421
00:35:20,939 --> 00:35:22,647
Invisible Man?

422
00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:26,315
You know, so no one would see me.

423
00:35:43,086 --> 00:35:44,497
There's Daniel.

424
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,338
- Where?
- In the shower.

425
00:35:46,423 --> 00:35:48,914
- How do you know?
- I just know.

426
00:35:49,009 --> 00:35:50,207
May I?

427
00:35:51,303 --> 00:35:55,170
- I don't know what she sees in him.
- She must be into fungus.

428
00:35:59,895 --> 00:36:02,600
Help me, my flower needs water.

429
00:36:04,024 --> 00:36:06,693
You've come to the right place, stranger.

430
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:11,645
- I've never danced in a shower.
- A friend of mine made this for me.

431
00:36:12,157 --> 00:36:13,188
Isn't it great?

432
00:36:13,367 --> 00:36:15,075
Where have you been hiding?

433
00:36:15,494 --> 00:36:17,118
I haven't been hiding.

434
00:36:17,204 --> 00:36:20,288
- I haven't seen you around.
- You been looking?

435
00:36:20,582 --> 00:36:22,290
- Sort of.
- Sort of?

436
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:25,076
I thought you were still angry with me.

437
00:36:25,754 --> 00:36:28,790
- Why?
- Because of what I said last time I saw you.

438
00:36:28,882 --> 00:36:30,839
I've been thinking a lot about that.

439
00:36:30,968 --> 00:36:33,589
I should learn to mind my own business.

440
00:36:34,054 --> 00:36:37,921
No, I think you're right about facing things.
I feel the same way.

441
00:36:38,517 --> 00:36:40,593
I just kind of forgot for a while.

442
00:36:40,727 --> 00:36:43,728
- Thanks for reminding me.
- You're welcome.

443
00:36:45,565 --> 00:36:48,566
He thinks he can do
whatever he wants to people.

444
00:36:49,236 --> 00:36:50,979
- Who?
- Johnny.

445
00:36:51,321 --> 00:36:53,693
I'd love to see him get some
of his own medicine.

446
00:36:53,782 --> 00:36:55,858
What goes around comes around.

447
00:36:56,034 --> 00:36:59,035
- I'd love to be there when it does.
- Me, too.

448
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,334
You want to go outside?

449
00:37:09,298 --> 00:37:10,792
You talked me into it.

450
00:37:16,179 --> 00:37:20,557
- That chicken is wild!
- That guy's using real eggs!

451
00:37:20,684 --> 00:37:22,178
He's great!

452
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:23,717
No!

453
00:37:30,694 --> 00:37:31,939
Johnny!

454
00:37:36,491 --> 00:37:37,571
Johnny!

455
00:37:41,705 --> 00:37:43,828
- Got that number rolled?
- In a minute.

456
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:46,323
I'm going to get the guys. Hurry up.

457
00:38:44,017 --> 00:38:45,298
Shit!

458
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:47,763
Move, man!

459
00:38:53,026 --> 00:38:54,935
Johnny, what's up?

460
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:59,735
Get out of my way!

461
00:39:00,158 --> 00:39:02,614
- What's wrong?
- It's coming around.

462
00:39:09,209 --> 00:39:10,205
Get up!

463
00:39:12,921 --> 00:39:14,084
Get out of my way!

464
00:39:22,139 --> 00:39:24,297
What the hell are you doing?

465
00:39:25,058 --> 00:39:26,553
Get out of the way!

466
00:40:02,054 --> 00:40:03,714
You ain't going nowhere.

467
00:40:08,936 --> 00:40:10,762
You little wimp!

468
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,643
You couldn't leave well enough alone,
could you, little twerp?

469
00:40:16,777 --> 00:40:19,813
No, you had to push it.
Well, now you're gonna pay!

470
00:40:22,574 --> 00:40:24,733
Where are you going, sweetheart?

471
00:40:24,993 --> 00:40:27,152
How about a front kick, Johnny?

472
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:32,781
Get him up.

473
00:40:32,876 --> 00:40:34,999
- He's had enough.
- Shut up!

474
00:40:35,087 --> 00:40:38,954
- He can't even stand up.
- That don't mean squat.

475
00:40:39,383 --> 00:40:43,427
- Johnny, he's had enough.
- I'll decide when he's had enough.

476
00:40:43,512 --> 00:40:45,386
What's wrong with you, Johnny?

477
00:40:45,514 --> 00:40:48,634
- An enemy deserves no mercy.
- Right!

478
00:40:49,184 --> 00:40:50,844
You're crazy, man!

479
00:40:55,941 --> 00:40:57,565
Get him!

480
00:41:27,055 --> 00:41:28,384
Daniel-<i>san</i>.

481
00:41:29,891 --> 00:41:30,971
Come.

482
00:42:13,518 --> 00:42:14,717
Leave on.

483
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:18,599
- It stinks. What is it?
- Smell bad, heal good.

484
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,609
- Where did Spider-Man go?
- Who?

485
00:42:26,198 --> 00:42:28,523
The guy who bailed me out.
Where'd he go?

486
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:33,658
What, you?

487
00:42:35,999 --> 00:42:38,490
- No way.
- Why "no way"?

488
00:42:38,585 --> 00:42:41,788
- Because...
- Because, old man?

489
00:42:43,048 --> 00:42:44,211
Have tea.

490
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,962
Feel better.

491
00:43:12,244 --> 00:43:13,738
Why didn't you tell me?

492
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:16,196
- Tell you what?
- That you do karate.

493
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,412
- You never ask.
- Where'd you learn it?

494
00:43:20,002 --> 00:43:21,033
Father.

495
00:43:21,587 --> 00:43:23,626
I thought he was a fisherman.

496
00:43:24,631 --> 00:43:27,383
In Okinawa, all Miyagi know two things:

497
00:43:27,926 --> 00:43:29,883
Fish and karate.

498
00:43:30,345 --> 00:43:33,180
Karate come from China, 16th century.

499
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:35,930
Called "<i>te</i>," hand.

500
00:43:36,727 --> 00:43:38,137
Much later...

501
00:43:38,729 --> 00:43:43,889
...Miyagi ancestors call "karate,"
empty hand.

502
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,361
I always thought it came
from Buddhist temples.

503
00:43:49,197 --> 00:43:51,273
You, too much TV.

504
00:43:52,284 --> 00:43:54,360
That's what my mother tells me.

505
00:43:58,582 --> 00:44:01,499
- Have you ever taught anyone?
- No.

506
00:44:01,585 --> 00:44:02,664
Would you?

507
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,294
- It depend.
- On what?

508
00:44:05,797 --> 00:44:06,829
Reason.

509
00:44:07,925 --> 00:44:09,335
How's revenge?

510
00:44:11,553 --> 00:44:16,132
You look for revenge that way,
start by digging two graves.

511
00:44:17,142 --> 00:44:19,431
At least I'd have company, right?

512
00:44:19,603 --> 00:44:22,972
Fighting always last answer to problem.

513
00:44:23,941 --> 00:44:26,977
Mr. Miyagi, I don't think
you understand my problem.

514
00:44:27,069 --> 00:44:30,272
Miyagi understand problem perfect.

515
00:44:31,406 --> 00:44:35,356
Your friend all karate student?

516
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:38,242
Friends? Yeah, those guys.

517
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:39,872
Problem attitude.

518
00:44:40,457 --> 00:44:44,122
The problem is I keep getting
my ass kicked.

519
00:44:44,336 --> 00:44:48,084
Because boys have bad attitude.

520
00:44:49,049 --> 00:44:51,421
Karate for defence only.

521
00:44:52,636 --> 00:44:54,961
That's not what these guys are taught.

522
00:44:55,514 --> 00:44:57,091
I can see.

523
00:44:57,808 --> 00:45:01,508
No such thing bad student,
only bad teacher.

524
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,309
Teacher say, student do.

525
00:45:05,565 --> 00:45:07,190
Great, that solves everything.

526
00:45:07,276 --> 00:45:11,439
I'll go to the school and straighten it out
with the teacher.

527
00:45:11,905 --> 00:45:15,357
Now use head
for something other than target.

528
00:45:16,702 --> 00:45:19,703
- I was only kidding.
- Why kidding?

529
00:45:20,289 --> 00:45:22,412
I get killed if I show up there.

530
00:45:23,375 --> 00:45:24,953
Get killed anyway.

531
00:45:30,716 --> 00:45:32,293
Would you go with me?

532
00:45:33,927 --> 00:45:35,172
No, I can't.

533
00:45:35,762 --> 00:45:37,554
Why? You said it was a good idea.

534
00:45:37,681 --> 00:45:39,472
For you, good idea.

535
00:45:39,558 --> 00:45:42,512
For me, good idea no get involved.

536
00:45:42,603 --> 00:45:45,058
But you're already involved.

537
00:45:45,188 --> 00:45:46,647
- Very sorry.
- What?

538
00:45:52,738 --> 00:45:54,777
Thanks for nothing then.

539
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,075
Like I didn't have enough problems already.

540
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:03,154
Now I've got to carry your weight, too.
Don't do me any more favours.

541
00:46:03,248 --> 00:46:05,620
- Daniel-<i>san</i>.
- What?

542
00:46:09,254 --> 00:46:11,543
Okay, I go.

543
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,920
- Excellent, Mr. Miyagi.
- Miyagi.

544
00:46:18,055 --> 00:46:19,169
Miyagi.

545
00:46:19,514 --> 00:46:21,424
What kind of belt do you have?

546
00:46:22,184 --> 00:46:23,263
Canvas.

547
00:46:23,518 --> 00:46:24,633
You like?

548
00:46:25,228 --> 00:46:27,186
J.C. Penney. $3.98.

549
00:46:27,898 --> 00:46:28,977
I meant...

550
00:46:29,107 --> 00:46:32,358
In Okinawa a belt means
no need rope hold up pants.

551
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:37,030
That's funny.

552
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:38,859
- Daniel-<i>san</i>.
- What?

553
00:46:40,661 --> 00:46:43,116
Karate here.

554
00:46:44,915 --> 00:46:46,658
Karate here.

555
00:46:47,417 --> 00:46:49,825
Karate never here.

556
00:46:51,421 --> 00:46:52,832
You understand?

557
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,914
I think so.

558
00:46:58,095 --> 00:46:59,803
Goodnight, Daniel-<i>san</i>.

559
00:47:01,014 --> 00:47:03,470
Goodnight, Mr. Miyagi. Miyagi!

560
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:06,018
Tomorrow morning?

561
00:47:06,395 --> 00:47:08,055
10:00.

562
00:47:13,986 --> 00:47:17,935
Thanks for helping me out
with my friends out there.

563
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:35,832
- Good morning, Mr. Miyagi.
- How do you feel?

564
00:47:35,924 --> 00:47:40,254
- A little sore.
- You know how drive?

565
00:47:40,345 --> 00:47:42,421
Yeah, I do.

566
00:47:43,473 --> 00:47:47,637
- No, I'm not very good at it.
- Me neither.

567
00:47:47,728 --> 00:47:49,720
I don't have a licence.

568
00:47:50,022 --> 00:47:51,302
Me neither.

569
00:47:52,107 --> 00:47:54,978
I guess it's okay then.

570
00:48:32,481 --> 00:48:35,186
You lose concentration
in a fight and you're dead meat!

571
00:48:35,275 --> 00:48:36,438
- Yes, <i>Sensei</i>.
- What?

572
00:48:36,526 --> 00:48:37,689
Yes, <i>Sensei</i>!

573
00:48:39,279 --> 00:48:40,442
Get up!

574
00:48:42,366 --> 00:48:45,070
Give me 60 pushups on your knuckles.

575
00:48:49,164 --> 00:48:50,409
Combat!

576
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:02,508
Brown. Robertson.

577
00:49:13,522 --> 00:49:14,684
On guard.

578
00:49:20,362 --> 00:49:21,904
Point. Round kick.

579
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:24,445
What are you looking at? Finish him!

580
00:49:26,368 --> 00:49:27,743
Return.

581
00:49:30,706 --> 00:49:32,164
Prepare.

582
00:49:35,586 --> 00:49:38,871
We do not train to be merciful, here.
Mercy is for the weak.

583
00:49:39,715 --> 00:49:42,585
Here, on the street, in competition...

584
00:49:42,676 --> 00:49:44,669
...a man confronts you, he is the enemy.

585
00:49:44,761 --> 00:49:48,545
An enemy deserves no mercy.
What is the problem, Mr. Lawrence?

586
00:49:52,019 --> 00:49:53,762
Come on, let's forget this.

587
00:49:54,479 --> 00:49:56,353
Wait, not yet.

588
00:49:58,525 --> 00:50:01,277
Class, we have visitors. Fall in behind me.

589
00:50:08,994 --> 00:50:11,567
I hear you jumped
some of my students last night.

590
00:50:12,164 --> 00:50:14,406
Afraid the facts mixed up.

591
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:16,667
Are you calling him a liar?

592
00:50:17,169 --> 00:50:18,996
No call no one nothing.

593
00:50:19,254 --> 00:50:21,294
What are you here for, old man?

594
00:50:21,381 --> 00:50:23,623
Come ask leave boy alone.

595
00:50:24,551 --> 00:50:27,007
Can't the boy take care of himself?

596
00:50:27,137 --> 00:50:28,880
One-to-one problem, yes.

597
00:50:29,473 --> 00:50:32,723
Five-to-one problem, too much ask anyone.

598
00:50:32,851 --> 00:50:35,223
Is that what's bothering you, the odds?

599
00:50:35,687 --> 00:50:37,479
Well, we can fix that.

600
00:50:37,898 --> 00:50:40,305
- Feel like matching, Mr. Lawrence?
- Yes, <i>Sensei</i>!

601
00:50:40,442 --> 00:50:41,687
No more fighting.

602
00:50:41,777 --> 00:50:44,184
This is a karate <i>dojo</i>, not a knitting class.

603
00:50:44,321 --> 00:50:47,488
You don't come in here,
drop a challenge and leave, old man.

604
00:50:48,325 --> 00:50:51,361
You get your boy on the mat,
or you and I will have a problem.

605
00:50:51,453 --> 00:50:54,703
Too much advantage, your <i>dojo</i>.

606
00:50:55,707 --> 00:50:57,202
Name a place.

607
00:50:57,876 --> 00:50:59,157
Tournament.

608
00:51:03,715 --> 00:51:06,669
You've got real nerve, old man.

609
00:51:08,053 --> 00:51:10,093
But I think we can accommodate you.

610
00:51:10,847 --> 00:51:12,674
Can't we, Mr. Lawrence?

611
00:51:12,849 --> 00:51:14,308
Yes, <i>Sensei</i>.

612
00:51:15,102 --> 00:51:16,181
Fall in.

613
00:51:20,857 --> 00:51:23,265
Ask one more small request.

614
00:51:23,986 --> 00:51:25,396
Make it fast.

615
00:51:25,737 --> 00:51:28,774
Ask leave boy alone to train.

616
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:32,405
You're a pushy little bastard, ain't you?

617
00:51:32,494 --> 00:51:34,487
But I like that.

618
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:41,459
No one touches the prima donna
until the tournament.

619
00:51:41,587 --> 00:51:44,920
- Is that understood?
- Yes, <i>Sensei</i>!

620
00:51:46,758 --> 00:51:48,336
But if you don't show...

621
00:51:49,845 --> 00:51:51,422
...then it's open season...

622
00:51:53,473 --> 00:51:54,754
...on him...

623
00:51:56,518 --> 00:51:57,799
...and you.

624
00:52:24,421 --> 00:52:25,963
I can't believe this.

625
00:52:26,632 --> 00:52:28,589
- I cannot believe this!
- What?

626
00:52:28,675 --> 00:52:32,044
What you just got me into.
You said you'd make things better.

627
00:52:32,137 --> 00:52:34,295
- I did.
- How?

628
00:52:34,598 --> 00:52:38,216
How? I saved you two months of beating.

629
00:52:38,936 --> 00:52:41,936
Great, now I've got something
to look forward to.

630
00:52:46,902 --> 00:52:49,060
How much further is your house?

631
00:52:49,905 --> 00:52:51,613
Other side tracks.

632
00:52:51,865 --> 00:52:54,107
Are you in the oil business, too?

633
00:52:55,035 --> 00:52:57,740
Not everything is as seem.

634
00:52:57,829 --> 00:53:00,403
Reminds me of Newark.
What are we going to do here?

635
00:53:00,499 --> 00:53:01,993
Start training.

636
00:53:02,417 --> 00:53:03,960
Much work be done.

637
00:53:04,169 --> 00:53:06,328
Tournament here before you know it.

638
00:53:06,755 --> 00:53:08,498
That's what I'm afraid of.

639
00:53:12,886 --> 00:53:16,754
That teacher was really wacko.
You really think I can beat that guy?

640
00:53:16,848 --> 00:53:18,307
No matter.

641
00:53:19,017 --> 00:53:21,852
Wacko teacher attitude rest in fist.

642
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,929
Stupid, but fact of life.

643
00:53:24,022 --> 00:53:25,849
Win, lose, no matter.

644
00:53:26,149 --> 00:53:28,854
You make good fight, earn respect.

645
00:53:29,111 --> 00:53:32,859
- Then nobody bother.
- They'll bury me where I fall.

646
00:53:33,657 --> 00:53:37,868
Either way, problem solved.
Wait right here.

647
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,249
This is great.

648
00:53:55,887 --> 00:53:59,802
- I forgot to give you this back.
- You keep.

649
00:53:59,891 --> 00:54:01,136
Thanks a lot.

650
00:54:01,935 --> 00:54:04,889
- Ready?
- Yeah, I guess so.

651
00:54:07,858 --> 00:54:09,897
Daniel-<i>san</i>, must talk.

652
00:54:12,195 --> 00:54:13,939
Walk on road.

653
00:54:14,364 --> 00:54:18,860
Walk right side, safe. Walk left side, safe.

654
00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:24,826
Walk middle, sooner or later,
you get squished just like grape.

655
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,576
Here, karate same thing.

656
00:54:27,669 --> 00:54:32,415
Either you karate do, yes, or karate do, no.

657
00:54:32,758 --> 00:54:37,254
You karate do, "guess so," just like grape.

658
00:54:38,388 --> 00:54:40,013
Understand?

659
00:54:41,183 --> 00:54:42,926
Yeah, I understand.

660
00:54:43,894 --> 00:54:45,436
Ready?

661
00:54:46,563 --> 00:54:47,892
Yeah, I'm ready.

662
00:54:48,065 --> 00:54:49,475
Yes.

663
00:54:51,777 --> 00:54:54,232
First make sacred pact.

664
00:54:55,489 --> 00:55:00,234
I promise teach karate. That's my part.

665
00:55:00,535 --> 00:55:07,783
You promise learn. I say, you do,
no questions. That's your part.

666
00:55:09,253 --> 00:55:10,451
Deal?

667
00:55:11,088 --> 00:55:12,630
It's a deal.

668
00:55:17,511 --> 00:55:21,211
First wash all the cars, then wax.

669
00:55:21,765 --> 00:55:26,226
- Why do I have to...
- Remember deal. No questions.

670
00:55:26,478 --> 00:55:28,435
Yeah, but...

671
00:55:29,356 --> 00:55:34,314
Wax on right hand. Wax off left hand.

672
00:55:34,695 --> 00:55:37,565
Wax on, wax off.

673
00:55:37,864 --> 00:55:41,399
Breathe in through nose,
out through mouth.

674
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:45,241
Wax on, wax off.

675
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:48,035
Don't forget to breathe. Very important.

676
00:55:48,292 --> 00:55:51,079
Wax on, wax off.

677
00:55:51,378 --> 00:55:53,667
Wax on, wax off.

678
00:55:53,755 --> 00:55:55,499
Where did these cars come from?

679
00:55:56,675 --> 00:55:58,050
Detroit.

680
00:56:16,737 --> 00:56:18,231
Wax on...

681
00:56:18,989 --> 00:56:20,946
...right hand make circle.

682
00:56:21,033 --> 00:56:23,820
Wax off, left hand make circle.

683
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:27,120
Wax on, wax off.

684
00:56:27,414 --> 00:56:30,534
Breathe in, breathe out.

685
00:56:30,792 --> 00:56:33,829
Wax on, wax off.

686
00:57:06,828 --> 00:57:09,402
Mr. Miyagi, I'm finished.

687
00:57:10,624 --> 00:57:12,367
You want to check these out?

688
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:14,991
Mr. Miyagi?

689
00:57:17,256 --> 00:57:18,335
Mr. Miyagi?

690
00:57:25,472 --> 00:57:26,717
Hello?

691
00:58:03,635 --> 00:58:06,340
I've been looking all over for you.
Where've you been?

692
00:58:06,471 --> 00:58:08,713
- I don't believe it.
- What?

693
00:58:08,932 --> 00:58:12,182
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to find that idiot.

694
00:58:12,269 --> 00:58:14,974
- No, it's been taken care of.
- Until next time.

695
00:58:15,105 --> 00:58:17,940
- There isn't going to be a "next time."
- There they are.

696
00:58:18,609 --> 00:58:22,191
Watch this.
Hey, guys, it's good to see you.

697
00:58:22,738 --> 00:58:25,442
Sorry about your eye, Johnny.
Your shoulder okay, Tommy?

698
00:58:25,657 --> 00:58:28,611
You guys be careful not to step
in front of any more buses.

699
00:58:29,536 --> 00:58:32,988
Hold it. Remember what <i>Sensei</i> said?
Wait for the tournament.

700
00:58:33,081 --> 00:58:35,454
It must be "Take a Worm for a Walk" week.

701
00:58:38,086 --> 00:58:39,629
You did all that damage?

702
00:58:39,713 --> 00:58:42,465
When you make a wish in the shower,
it always comes true.

703
00:58:42,549 --> 00:58:45,716
- I should have kept my mouth shut.
- No, we've got an agreement.

704
00:58:45,802 --> 00:58:47,462
Yeah? What's that?

705
00:58:47,554 --> 00:58:52,263
They agreed not to beat up on me
and I promised not to bleed on them.

706
00:58:53,143 --> 00:58:55,812
- I don't believe you.
- What can I do, moan and groan?

707
00:58:55,896 --> 00:58:59,312
- Anybody else would.
- Who'd listen anyway?

708
00:58:59,441 --> 00:59:00,520
Me.

709
00:59:01,693 --> 00:59:03,104
Really?

710
00:59:04,154 --> 00:59:08,234
- You feel like listening on Saturday night?
- Sure.

711
00:59:08,575 --> 00:59:10,615
Great! So Saturday night...

712
00:59:10,702 --> 00:59:14,202
...we'll go out, we'll have a good time.
We'll do whatever.

713
00:59:15,457 --> 00:59:18,209
- Is that your address?
- You got it.

714
00:59:19,169 --> 00:59:20,663
Where is this?

715
00:59:21,505 --> 00:59:23,296
- I've got to go.
- Okay.

716
00:59:23,382 --> 00:59:26,383
I'll talk to you later. Great.

717
00:59:27,261 --> 00:59:28,459
All right.

718
00:59:32,015 --> 00:59:36,476
Mr. Harris, can I talk to you?
LaRusso. Third period history class.

719
00:59:36,603 --> 00:59:41,894
I wanted to tell you, I really got a lot
out of that lecture about the Indians.

720
00:59:42,318 --> 00:59:47,360
I was telling my buddies about it.
Could you give us a quick review?

721
00:59:47,448 --> 00:59:50,022
- Sure, I'm free this period.
- Great for me.

722
00:59:50,118 --> 00:59:52,656
No, I got to go.

723
00:59:53,079 --> 00:59:56,530
I guess that leaves you and me,
but that's all right.

724
00:59:56,624 --> 00:59:59,080
You can tell them about it later.

725
00:59:59,168 --> 01:00:03,415
The Plains Indians
were a very primitive tribe...

726
01:00:17,312 --> 01:00:18,806
Come on, Casanova.

727
01:00:46,341 --> 01:00:48,748
- Hi, how are you doing?
- Good.

728
01:00:48,843 --> 01:00:51,168
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

729
01:00:51,346 --> 01:00:53,089
You've got company.

730
01:00:53,181 --> 01:00:56,597
Those are my parents.
Come on, I want you to meet them.

731
01:00:56,726 --> 01:00:58,185
Great.

732
01:00:58,811 --> 01:01:00,603
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi, Dad.

733
01:01:00,688 --> 01:01:03,096
This is Daniel LaRusso.

734
01:01:03,191 --> 01:01:06,192
- My parents, Mr. And Mrs. Mills.
- How do you do, Daniel?

735
01:01:07,237 --> 01:01:09,395
- Hello, Daniel.
- Nice to meet you.

736
01:01:09,489 --> 01:01:12,525
- Where are you going?
- I don't know. Where are we going?

737
01:01:12,617 --> 01:01:14,408
I don't know. Wherever you want.

738
01:01:14,494 --> 01:01:17,744
- Golf N' Stuff?
- We're going to Golf N' Stuff, then.

739
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:21,707
Don't worry about that.
Weren't you going to have that fixed?

740
01:01:21,793 --> 01:01:23,750
I am. I was. I will.

741
01:01:23,878 --> 01:01:27,793
- You live in Encino, Daniel?
- Encino? No.

742
01:01:28,424 --> 01:01:32,505
- Where do you live?
- Out, like Reseda.

743
01:01:34,222 --> 01:01:37,840
- And that's your mother?
- Yeah, that's her.

744
01:01:37,934 --> 01:01:39,214
Hi!

745
01:01:39,602 --> 01:01:42,473
She's waiting for us.
We'd better go. Nice to meet you.

746
01:01:42,564 --> 01:01:45,268
- Not too late, sweetheart.
- Okay, Dad.

747
01:01:49,946 --> 01:01:54,489
- Hi, Mrs. LaRusso. I'm Ali.
- Hi, Ali. Call me Lucille.

748
01:01:55,451 --> 01:01:58,369
- That's a beautiful house you have.
- Thanks.

749
01:02:05,795 --> 01:02:07,373
- Can you drive a stick?
- Yeah.

750
01:02:08,047 --> 01:02:11,962
Put it into second, let it roll,
and when I say "pop it," pop it.

751
01:02:12,093 --> 01:02:13,172
"Pop it."

752
01:02:18,558 --> 01:02:20,883
Don't worry, it's all under control.

753
01:02:21,603 --> 01:02:24,603
She's cute. It happens a lot.

754
01:02:24,981 --> 01:02:29,192
Okay, LaRusso, push! On, you huskies!

755
01:02:29,319 --> 01:02:31,525
Okay, pop it!

756
01:02:32,238 --> 01:02:34,646
We got it on the first!

757
01:02:52,926 --> 01:02:57,137
I'll pick you up at 11:00.
Please, don't be late. Have fun.

758
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:05,013
- Look at that slide.
- We'll do that next time.

759
01:03:06,022 --> 01:03:08,939
- Why next time?
- You need a bathing suit.

760
01:03:09,609 --> 01:03:12,361
Oh, yeah. Bathing suits.

761
01:03:12,445 --> 01:03:16,609
- Do you play hockey?
- Not professionally.

762
01:04:20,263 --> 01:04:22,884
This is the best time
I've had since I've been here.

763
01:04:22,974 --> 01:04:25,891
- We'll have to do it again.
- Definitely.

764
01:04:26,394 --> 01:04:28,303
Hey, good looking. How are you?

765
01:04:28,438 --> 01:04:29,932
Good. This is cool.

766
01:04:30,023 --> 01:04:33,024
- I just got it. You want a ride?
- Some other time.

767
01:04:33,276 --> 01:04:36,277
- Are you sure?
- Daniel, this is Eddie. Eddie, Daniel.

768
01:04:36,404 --> 01:04:38,231
- How are you doing, Daniel?
- Good.

769
01:04:38,323 --> 01:04:41,489
- Hey, Ali! How's it going?
- Hi, guys.

770
01:04:41,576 --> 01:04:44,779
- How are you doing?
- Want to come with us?

771
01:04:44,913 --> 01:04:48,364
No, I don't think so.
You guys have a good time.

772
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:50,747
- We'll make room.
- I'll call you tomorrow.

773
01:04:50,835 --> 01:04:53,540
Your little friend can come,
if it's okay with his mommy.

774
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:54,910
Hi, kids.

775
01:04:55,340 --> 01:05:00,167
- Hey, Mommy, can Daniel come for a ride?
- I really like your car.

776
01:05:08,603 --> 01:05:12,019
- You could've gone.
- I didn't want to.

777
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:17,102
- It's no big deal.
- Lf I'd wanted to go, I would have.

778
01:05:17,987 --> 01:05:21,356
It makes no difference to me.
Do what you want, I don't care.

779
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:55,350
This is beautiful.

780
01:05:59,237 --> 01:06:04,314
Mr. Miyagi, this is great.
You've got real fish in there.

781
01:06:06,786 --> 01:06:08,577
This is outrageous.

782
01:06:09,539 --> 01:06:13,750
I thought Chung Lee's restaurant was nice.
You beat his act.

783
01:06:13,835 --> 01:06:16,705
This is paradise. Did you do this yourself?

784
01:06:18,298 --> 01:06:19,792
Are these bongos?

785
01:06:20,174 --> 01:06:21,966
No, I got it.

786
01:06:22,135 --> 01:06:25,634
<i>"Hare Krishna"</i>

787
01:06:25,847 --> 01:06:27,804
<i>Daniel-san, you much humour.</i>

788
01:06:27,891 --> 01:06:30,560
- What are these?
- Japanese sander.

789
01:06:30,894 --> 01:06:34,097
- What do you do with them?
- Funny you should ask.

790
01:06:37,025 --> 01:06:38,567
Right circle.

791
01:06:39,986 --> 01:06:41,528
Left circle.

792
01:06:42,614 --> 01:06:46,658
- It'd be easier going back and forth.
- But you go circle.

793
01:06:46,784 --> 01:06:48,327
Right circle.

794
01:06:48,912 --> 01:06:50,454
Left circle.

795
01:06:51,748 --> 01:06:55,698
Right circle, left circle.

796
01:06:56,294 --> 01:06:58,867
Breathe in, breathe out.

797
01:06:59,547 --> 01:07:02,797
Right circle, left circle.

798
01:07:03,384 --> 01:07:05,710
Right circle, left circle.

799
01:07:05,803 --> 01:07:08,211
Breathe in, breathe out.

800
01:07:10,225 --> 01:07:15,811
Whole floor. Right circle, left circle.

801
01:07:16,397 --> 01:07:18,141
Right circle.

802
01:07:18,691 --> 01:07:20,518
Left circle.

803
01:07:20,902 --> 01:07:24,187
Breathe in, breathe out.

804
01:07:42,966 --> 01:07:44,460
Very good.

805
01:07:46,177 --> 01:07:48,300
Splinters all gone.

806
01:07:51,391 --> 01:07:53,015
I'm finished.

807
01:07:53,685 --> 01:07:56,010
Mr. Miyagi, I'm beat.

808
01:07:56,854 --> 01:07:58,313
My shoulders.

809
01:07:58,731 --> 01:07:59,763
Good.

810
01:08:00,567 --> 01:08:02,524
Go home, get rest.

811
01:08:02,902 --> 01:08:06,817
Come morning, start early. 6:00.

812
01:08:56,414 --> 01:08:58,454
Wouldn't a fly swatter be easier?

813
01:08:59,459 --> 01:09:04,334
Man who catch fly with chopsticks,
accomplish anything.

814
01:09:06,466 --> 01:09:08,043
Did you ever catch one?

815
01:09:08,384 --> 01:09:09,879
Not yet.

816
01:09:12,847 --> 01:09:14,128
Could I try?

817
01:09:15,683 --> 01:09:16,928
If wish.

818
01:09:43,086 --> 01:09:45,078
Hey, Mr. Miyagi, look!

819
01:09:52,595 --> 01:09:54,504
You, beginner luck.

820
01:09:56,558 --> 01:10:01,266
I guess that means I can accomplish
anything, right? No sweat.

821
01:10:01,521 --> 01:10:05,221
First you accomplish paint fence.

822
01:10:17,078 --> 01:10:18,738
All in wrist.

823
01:10:19,706 --> 01:10:23,205
Wrist up. Wrist down.

824
01:10:24,335 --> 01:10:29,460
All in wrist. Up, down, long stroke.

825
01:10:29,549 --> 01:10:32,669
Very good. Up, down.

826
01:10:33,052 --> 01:10:35,211
No look me, look fence.

827
01:10:36,347 --> 01:10:37,379
Up...

828
01:10:38,558 --> 01:10:39,589
...down.

829
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:44,678
Bend the wrist. Downstroke, you bend.
See? Good.

830
01:10:44,772 --> 01:10:48,391
Long stroke. Up, down. Very good.

831
01:10:48,484 --> 01:10:50,810
Bend your knees. Down.

832
01:10:50,945 --> 01:10:52,024
Up.

833
01:10:53,698 --> 01:10:56,189
<i>Very good, Daniel-san.
Don't forget to breathe.</i>

834
01:10:56,326 --> 01:10:58,117
In, out.

835
01:10:58,203 --> 01:10:59,234
Up...

836
01:11:00,413 --> 01:11:01,528
...down.

837
01:11:03,249 --> 01:11:05,954
Up, down.

838
01:11:06,336 --> 01:11:07,367
Up...

839
01:11:08,171 --> 01:11:09,202
...down.

840
01:11:09,923 --> 01:11:10,954
Up...

841
01:11:11,591 --> 01:11:12,622
...down.

842
01:11:17,513 --> 01:11:19,173
<i>Very good, Daniel-san.</i>

843
01:11:19,432 --> 01:11:21,590
Up, down.

844
01:11:22,894 --> 01:11:24,305
Up...

845
01:11:25,521 --> 01:11:26,980
...down.

846
01:11:32,487 --> 01:11:35,820
Small board, left hand.
Big board, right hand.

847
01:11:36,074 --> 01:11:39,573
- I'm almost done.
- All of fence.

848
01:11:43,706 --> 01:11:48,534
Big board, right hand.
Small board, left hand.

849
01:11:48,962 --> 01:11:50,919
Up, down.

850
01:11:51,965 --> 01:11:54,041
Up, down.

851
01:12:13,486 --> 01:12:14,767
All finished.

852
01:12:15,196 --> 01:12:16,821
It looks pretty good, huh?

853
01:12:17,657 --> 01:12:19,032
Both sides?

854
01:12:23,204 --> 01:12:24,367
Not yet.

855
01:12:40,638 --> 01:12:44,173
<i>Daniel-san. Very good job.</i>

856
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:47,767
Come morning. Start early.

857
01:13:01,201 --> 01:13:02,363
Up...

858
01:13:02,994 --> 01:13:04,239
...down.

859
01:13:04,871 --> 01:13:06,151
Up...

860
01:13:06,414 --> 01:13:07,825
...down.

861
01:13:37,028 --> 01:13:39,733
Damn it! I can't believe this.

862
01:14:00,301 --> 01:14:01,879
Missed spot.

863
01:14:02,303 --> 01:14:03,548
What spot?

864
01:14:03,721 --> 01:14:07,636
- You didn't tell me you were going fishing.
- You not here when I go.

865
01:14:07,809 --> 01:14:11,392
- Maybe I wanted to go.
- You karate training.

866
01:14:11,479 --> 01:14:14,314
I'm what? I'm being your goddamn slave!

867
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:16,438
- We made a deal here.
- So?

868
01:14:16,526 --> 01:14:19,480
"So"? You're supposed to teach
and I'm supposed to learn.

869
01:14:19,612 --> 01:14:22,815
Four days I've been busting my ass,
I haven't learned a thing.

870
01:14:22,907 --> 01:14:26,157
- You learn plenty.
- I've learned to sand your decks.

871
01:14:26,244 --> 01:14:29,613
I've waxed your car, I paint your house,
paint your fence.

872
01:14:29,706 --> 01:14:33,620
- Not everything is as seems.
- Bullshit! I'm going home, man.

873
01:14:34,335 --> 01:14:36,292
<i>Daniel-san!</i>

874
01:14:37,422 --> 01:14:39,213
- What?
- Come here.

875
01:14:44,804 --> 01:14:48,932
- Show me sand the floor.
- I can't move my arm, all right?

876
01:14:54,230 --> 01:14:55,511
What are you doing?

877
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:02,476
What are you doing?

878
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:08,695
- Now show me sand the floor.
- How did you do that?

879
01:15:08,953 --> 01:15:09,985
Show!

880
01:15:13,124 --> 01:15:14,749
Sand the floor?

881
01:15:18,004 --> 01:15:19,582
Stand up.

882
01:15:21,507 --> 01:15:24,295
Show me sand the floor.

883
01:15:27,305 --> 01:15:29,048
Sand the floor.

884
01:15:29,849 --> 01:15:31,094
Sand the floor.

885
01:15:31,726 --> 01:15:33,849
Big circle. Sand the floor.

886
01:15:35,021 --> 01:15:36,396
Sand the floor.

887
01:15:38,816 --> 01:15:42,316
Now show me wax on, wax off.

888
01:15:50,328 --> 01:15:53,364
- Wax on, wax off.
- "Wax on, wax off!"

889
01:15:53,456 --> 01:15:54,571
Wax on...

890
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:56,281
...wax off.

891
01:15:57,168 --> 01:15:59,624
Concentrate. Look in my eyes.

892
01:15:59,754 --> 01:16:02,210
Lock your hand, thumb inside.

893
01:16:02,507 --> 01:16:04,250
Wax on...

894
01:16:04,551 --> 01:16:06,294
...wax off.

895
01:16:06,594 --> 01:16:07,875
Wax on...

896
01:16:08,846 --> 01:16:10,389
...wax off.

897
01:16:11,849 --> 01:16:13,048
Wax on.

898
01:16:14,227 --> 01:16:15,472
Wax off.

899
01:16:17,939 --> 01:16:21,189
Show me paint the fence. Up, down.

900
01:16:23,695 --> 01:16:24,774
Up.

901
01:16:25,405 --> 01:16:26,436
Down.

902
01:16:26,865 --> 01:16:27,896
Up.

903
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:29,362
Down.

904
01:16:29,534 --> 01:16:32,488
Other side. Look eye. Always look eye!

905
01:16:33,037 --> 01:16:35,196
Show me paint the house. Side, side.

906
01:16:39,544 --> 01:16:42,913
Lock wrist. Side, side.

907
01:16:43,882 --> 01:16:45,080
Side, side.

908
01:16:46,509 --> 01:16:49,214
Show me wax on, wax off.

909
01:16:56,269 --> 01:16:58,226
Show me paint the fence.

910
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:05,566
Show me side, side.

911
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:12,573
Show me sand the floor.

912
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:34,550
Look eye! Always look eye.

913
01:17:35,725 --> 01:17:37,682
Come back tomorrow.

914
01:18:24,983 --> 01:18:29,063
Learn balance. Go water, kick.
Learn balance.

915
01:20:12,173 --> 01:20:14,629
What were you doing on those stumps?

916
01:20:15,009 --> 01:20:17,963
- Called crane technique.
- Does it work?

917
01:20:18,429 --> 01:20:20,967
If do right, no can defence.

918
01:20:21,266 --> 01:20:22,808
Could you teach me?

919
01:20:22,976 --> 01:20:25,977
First learn stand, then learn fly.

920
01:20:26,396 --> 01:20:30,440
<i>- Nature rule, Daniel-san, not mine.
- Who taught you?</i>

921
01:20:30,567 --> 01:20:34,315
- Father teach.
- You must have had some father.

922
01:20:35,488 --> 01:20:39,700
- Look, the kid's got a pet Nip.
- He know any tricks, kid?

923
01:20:41,077 --> 01:20:44,695
Excuse, please. Boy cold, must leave.

924
01:20:44,789 --> 01:20:47,410
Kindly remove bottle.

925
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:53,712
Kindly do it yourself, Mr. Moto.

926
01:21:04,475 --> 01:21:06,634
How did you do that?

927
01:21:06,728 --> 01:21:09,645
Don't know. First time.

928
01:21:14,194 --> 01:21:16,151
Hey, you!

929
01:21:24,996 --> 01:21:29,575
- Hey, not bad. Definitely varsity material.
- You let me.

930
01:21:29,792 --> 01:21:35,747
Should we try the slide on Friday?
I could pick you up about 7:00.

931
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:38,926
I'm having dinner with my parents
at the country club.

932
01:21:39,010 --> 01:21:41,797
I'll be done by 9:30. Meet me out front.

933
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:43,299
- Is that cool?
- Yeah.

934
01:21:43,389 --> 01:21:44,765
Johnny, over here!

935
01:21:46,226 --> 01:21:48,847
- What's the matter?
- It's that little voice again.

936
01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:52,519
Pretend you're deaf.
Encino Oaks Country Club. 9:30.

937
01:21:52,607 --> 01:21:55,276
Friday? Great.

938
01:21:55,401 --> 01:21:57,857
- Hi, Ali.
- "Hi, Ali."

939
01:21:57,946 --> 01:21:59,985
I've got to be nuts.

940
01:22:14,212 --> 01:22:16,964
Okay, here. Stop. Throw anchor.

941
01:22:23,346 --> 01:22:25,635
Good. Stand bow.

942
01:22:28,184 --> 01:22:30,260
Not bow. Bow!

943
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:33,638
- Up!
- What, up front?

944
01:22:34,190 --> 01:22:35,353
Make block.

945
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:38,558
Left, right. Up, down.

946
01:22:39,445 --> 01:22:42,530
Side, side. Breathe in, breathe out.

947
01:22:44,158 --> 01:22:45,902
And no scare fish.

948
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:52,788
When do I learn how to punch?

949
01:22:53,626 --> 01:22:55,535
Better learn balance.

950
01:22:55,962 --> 01:22:57,789
Balance is key.

951
01:22:58,006 --> 01:23:02,050
Balance good, karate good.
Everything good.

952
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:06,721
Balance bad, better pack up, go home.
Understand?

953
01:23:08,182 --> 01:23:09,593
Yeah, I understand.

954
01:23:14,355 --> 01:23:16,977
Did you ever get into fights
when you were a kid?

955
01:23:17,358 --> 01:23:18,603
Plenty.

956
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:23,902
- It wasn't like the problem I have, right?
- Fighting, fighting. Same, same.

957
01:23:24,157 --> 01:23:25,984
But you knew karate.

958
01:23:26,492 --> 01:23:29,328
Someone always know more.

959
01:23:30,038 --> 01:23:32,611
There were times
when you were scared to fight?

960
01:23:34,334 --> 01:23:37,453
Always scared. Miyagi hate fighting.

961
01:23:38,338 --> 01:23:41,173
- But you like karate.
- So?

962
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:44,257
Karate's fighting, you train to fight.

963
01:23:46,429 --> 01:23:47,971
That what you think?

964
01:23:52,268 --> 01:23:53,347
No.

965
01:23:53,478 --> 01:23:54,937
Then why train?

966
01:23:57,315 --> 01:23:59,023
So I won't have to fight.

967
01:24:00,944 --> 01:24:02,853
Miyagi have hope for you.

968
01:24:03,571 --> 01:24:06,691
- When do I learn how to punch?
- Learn how punch...

969
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:09,785
...when learn how keep dry!
- No!

970
01:24:13,957 --> 01:24:17,207
<i>Daniel-san, you're all wet behind ear!</i>

971
01:24:17,335 --> 01:24:19,078
Are you crazy?

972
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:21,790
You're crazy.

973
01:24:43,444 --> 01:24:45,022
Trouble with Johnny?

974
01:24:45,405 --> 01:24:49,070
- You two lovebirds having problems?
- We're not lovebirds.

975
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:53,150
- What time is it?
- It's about 9:40.

976
01:24:54,122 --> 01:24:57,242
- I've got to go.
- Do you have a date?

977
01:25:00,461 --> 01:25:02,620
- With whom?
- A friend.

978
01:25:02,714 --> 01:25:04,956
Not that boy from Reseda.

979
01:25:05,216 --> 01:25:07,125
Yeah, he's from Reseda.

980
01:25:07,218 --> 01:25:09,590
He's a nice guy. It's no big deal.

981
01:25:09,721 --> 01:25:13,303
Honey, you've monopolised
the best-looking man here long enough.

982
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:16,051
- Hi.
- Hi.

983
01:25:18,104 --> 01:25:21,639
I've been thinking,
maybe we can call a truce.

984
01:25:22,192 --> 01:25:25,192
I'm not at war. Excuse me.

985
01:25:25,486 --> 01:25:27,479
Could we please finish the dance?

986
01:26:30,802 --> 01:26:33,257
Don't you ever do that to me again!

987
01:27:26,024 --> 01:27:28,811
I didn't know you were a singer.
How are you doing?

988
01:27:29,861 --> 01:27:34,024
<i>Daniel-san, come inside.</i>

989
01:27:34,574 --> 01:27:37,990

- Japanese blues.

- Anniversary.

999

Whose anniversary?

1000

Is this your wife?
I didn't know you were married.

1001

- Damn beautiful, don't you think?
- Yeah, she's pretty.

1002

First time I saw her...

1003

...was cane field, Hawaii.

1004

Beautiful.

1005
01:28:52,402 --> 01:28:54,608
Damn good cane cutter, too.

1006
01:28:57,824 --> 01:28:59,401
Where is she now?

I tell you what Miyagi think,
I think you dance around too much.

You sure know how to make
a guy feel confident.

You trust the quality of what you know,

Just remember:

A licence never replace eye, ear and brain.

1108
01:39:31,916 --> 01:39:33,375
What matter?

1109

01:40:24,052 --> 01:40:26,210
You're the best friend I ever had.

1120
01:40:28,223 --> 01:40:29,421
You...

1121
01:40:30,558 --> 01:40:32,467
...pretty okay, too.

1122
01:40:36,522 --> 01:40:38,147
Go.

1123
01:40:38,983 --> 01:40:40,608
Go find the balance.

1124
01:40:50,203 --> 01:40:53,073
<i>- Banzai, Daniel-san!
- Banzai!</i>

1125
01:41:38,209 --> 01:41:41,459
I give up. Don't shoot! No.

1126
01:41:43,339 --> 01:41:46,044
- Don't leave me. I'm wounded.
- Good, maybe you'll die.

1127
01:41:50,513 --> 01:41:53,929
- I just wanted to apologise.
- Fine, you apologised.

1128
01:41:54,642 --> 01:41:57,477
- I got my licence.
- Whoop-dee-doo.

1129
01:41:57,770 --> 01:42:01,222
- What's with you?
- What do you expect? Cartwheels?

1130
01:42:02,358 --> 01:42:07,898
I just expected some courtesy,
or is that only for people with fancy cars?

1131
01:42:10,325 --> 01:42:12,780
Can't you take a hint?

1132
01:42:17,498 --> 01:42:19,158
Does the truth hurt?

1133
01:42:19,292 --> 01:42:21,700
- You really think that's it?
- I know it is.

1134
01:42:21,794 --> 01:42:24,036
- You're wrong.
- I bet I'm wrong.

1135
01:42:24,130 --> 01:42:28,258
I didn't go out with you
because of a car or where you live.

1136
01:42:28,343 --> 01:42:31,012
Okay, while we're on the subject,
why did you then?

1137
01:42:32,222 --> 01:42:33,502
Why did you?

1138
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:36,890
I thought maybe you and me
were different.

1139
01:42:36,976 --> 01:42:40,476
I'm from Reseda, you're from the hills,
that's how we're different.

1140
01:42:40,563 --> 01:42:43,813
Admit that you just can't handle
the situation the way it is.

1141
01:42:44,234 --> 01:42:46,938
I can handle it fine. You can't.

1142
01:42:48,071 --> 01:42:51,819
What makes you so sensitive?
She's never been anything but nice to you.

1143
01:42:51,991 --> 01:42:55,526
- She used me to make him jealous.
- She doesn't even like him.

1144
01:42:55,620 --> 01:42:59,321
Who could tell, the way their faces
were stuck together at the country club?

1145
01:42:59,415 --> 01:43:03,662
Right, you didn't stick around
for the exciting conclusion.

1146
01:43:03,753 --> 01:43:06,042
- What, his hand on her ass?
- Her right hook.

1147
01:43:06,130 --> 01:43:09,250
You think she sprained her wrist
doing her nails?

1148
01:43:10,927 --> 01:43:13,881
- She hit him?
- That's an understatement.

1149
01:43:16,099 --> 01:43:20,393
- Why didn't she say something?
- She shouldn't have to, should she?

1150
01:43:39,914 --> 01:43:41,325
Hey, slugger.

1151
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:48,789
Look, I'm a jerk.

1152
01:43:52,135 --> 01:43:53,795
You are a jerk.

1153
01:43:54,888 --> 01:43:56,430
So, am I forgiven?

1154
01:43:58,433 --> 01:44:00,342
I don't hear anything.

1155
01:44:00,935 --> 01:44:02,762
Sounds like a "yes" to me.

1156
01:44:03,271 --> 01:44:05,643
Come here.

1157
01:44:16,701 --> 01:44:19,274
I guess you know
about the tournament tomorrow.

1158
01:44:19,787 --> 01:44:21,116
Who doesn't?

1159
01:44:21,247 --> 01:44:22,623
Dumb move, huh?

1160
01:44:23,249 --> 01:44:25,041
Not necessarily.

1161
01:44:25,627 --> 01:44:28,200
I don't have much of a cheering section.

1162
01:44:28,504 --> 01:44:29,999
You got me.

1163
01:44:30,882 --> 01:44:33,966
I'll probably get killed in the first match.

1164
01:44:35,136 --> 01:44:37,093
So, we'll leave early.

1165
01:44:52,070 --> 01:44:55,521
- I've got something to show you.
- What?

1166
01:44:59,077 --> 01:45:02,944
- How do you like it?
- Is it yours? Are you serious?

1167
01:45:03,039 --> 01:45:06,490
- It's beautiful.
- It sure is.

1168
01:45:06,584 --> 01:45:08,743
- My God.
- Here you go.

1169
01:45:08,836 --> 01:45:11,873
- You want me to drive?
- It's the '80s!

1170
01:45:13,383 --> 01:45:16,549
- To start, you push that button.
- You're incredible.

1171
01:45:16,636 --> 01:45:21,049
Press the clutch.
Get the lights, no that one.

1172
01:45:21,641 --> 01:45:25,721
Good. Down is first. Let it out slow.

1173
01:45:26,312 --> 01:45:28,388
Hold on!

1174
01:45:29,774 --> 01:45:32,775
This is awesome. How fast does it go?

1175
01:45:33,194 --> 01:45:34,653
Let's not find out.

1176
01:45:38,241 --> 01:45:40,993
- What belt are you?
- Why matter?

1177
01:45:41,077 --> 01:45:44,031
This is open division,
it's only for brown belt or above.

1178
01:45:44,122 --> 01:45:45,865
Boy black belt.

1179
01:45:47,333 --> 01:45:50,916
You'd better hustle. They're starting.
Down the hall, to your left.

1180
01:45:51,254 --> 01:45:53,330
- I'll see you inside.
- Okay.

1181
01:45:54,048 --> 01:45:56,337
Excuse me, Mr. Referee.

1182
01:45:56,467 --> 01:45:59,718
This is not "Miyaji." Miyagi.

1183
01:45:59,804 --> 01:46:01,631
Miyagi.

1184
01:46:01,764 --> 01:46:03,342
Okay, thank you.

1185
01:46:12,108 --> 01:46:16,735
Well, look who we have here.
Our little friend Danielle.

1186
01:46:16,863 --> 01:46:18,440
Hello, Danielle.

1187
01:46:18,531 --> 01:46:21,651
What's the matter?
Mommy not here to dress you?

1188
01:46:22,619 --> 01:46:26,118
I'm talking to you, punk.
Come on, make a move.

1189
01:46:26,206 --> 01:46:28,115
Hey, save it for the ring.

1190
01:46:28,333 --> 01:46:29,364
Come on!

1191
01:46:30,043 --> 01:46:32,035
- All right.
- Let's go.

1192
01:46:32,754 --> 01:46:33,833
Come on.

1193
01:46:34,005 --> 01:46:36,163
Points or no points...

1194
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:38,580
...you're dead meat.

1195
01:46:39,469 --> 01:46:41,508
I said out!

1196
01:46:43,890 --> 01:46:45,349
Dead meat.

1197
01:46:49,187 --> 01:46:51,678
Way to go, I think he's gonna cry.

1198
01:47:02,033 --> 01:47:07,240
<i>The winner of the first match
in the open division is Rufus Schneider.</i>

1199
01:47:07,830 --> 01:47:11,579
- Mr. Miyagi.
- Hurry. Tournament starting.

1200
01:47:11,668 --> 01:47:12,414
Where'd we get this?

1201
01:47:12,502 --> 01:47:13,248
<i>Daniel LaRusso...</i>

1202
01:47:13,336 --> 01:47:16,787
<i>- Buddha provide.
- ... please report to Ring 3.</i>

1203
01:47:17,006 --> 01:47:18,666
- Where's Ring 3?
- Over there.

1204
01:47:18,758 --> 01:47:22,293
Hold it! Sorry, teachers and students only.

1205
01:47:23,012 --> 01:47:24,590
He doesn't speak English...

1206
01:47:24,681 --> 01:47:28,725
...and I can't understand his instructions
without her. She's his translator.

1207
01:47:30,061 --> 01:47:34,937
- What did he say?
- You remind him of his uncle in Tokyo.

1208
01:47:35,024 --> 01:47:40,185
- I guess it's okay. What?
- He says you're very kind.

1209
01:47:40,446 --> 01:47:42,356
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

1210
01:47:44,868 --> 01:47:47,441
- What are the rules here?
- I don't know.

1211
01:47:48,162 --> 01:47:50,239
First time you, first time me.

1212
01:47:50,331 --> 01:47:54,080
I figured you knew about this stuff.
I figured you went to these before.

1213
01:47:54,168 --> 01:47:55,413
Great, I'm dead.

1214
01:47:55,503 --> 01:47:59,252
- You told me you fought a lot.
- For life, not for points.

1215
01:47:59,632 --> 01:48:01,874
Everything above your waist is a point.

1216
01:48:02,093 --> 01:48:05,544
You can hit the head, sternum,
kidneys, ribs. Got it?

1217
01:48:05,638 --> 01:48:07,845
- I hope so.
- You can do it.

1218
01:48:08,182 --> 01:48:10,555
When are you jerks going to grow up?

1219
01:48:16,983 --> 01:48:20,067
- Where am I, over here at this one?
- Number 3.

1220
01:48:20,153 --> 01:48:22,311
- What's that guy kneeling for?
- I don't know.

1221
01:48:22,405 --> 01:48:25,489
- Don't you know anything?
- Don't get hit.

1222
01:48:34,876 --> 01:48:38,126
Face. Bow. On guard.

1223
01:48:39,464 --> 01:48:40,163
Fight.

1224
01:48:46,638 --> 01:48:47,918
Back on your line.

1225
01:48:48,056 --> 01:48:50,095
Be tough, Daniel.

1226
01:48:52,602 --> 01:48:54,061
Come on, be tough.

1227
01:48:57,106 --> 01:49:00,938
Remember your defence. Points coming.
Concentrate. Focus power.

1228
01:49:01,027 --> 01:49:03,352
Remember balance. Make good fight.

1229
01:49:05,281 --> 01:49:08,531
Run out of the ring once more,
it'll cost you a point.

1230
01:49:08,618 --> 01:49:10,492
On guard. Ready?

1231
01:49:18,878 --> 01:49:21,085
That's one, Daniel, come on.

1232
01:49:23,591 --> 01:49:25,085
One more!

1233
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:27,338
Move back on your line.

1234
01:49:28,221 --> 01:49:30,546
That's one point, round kick.

1235
01:49:31,808 --> 01:49:34,844
Daniel, you're the best!

1236
01:49:51,786 --> 01:49:53,115
You're dead!

1237
01:51:35,223 --> 01:51:37,014
Point! Winner!

1238
01:52:26,399 --> 01:52:27,679
Winner!

1239
01:52:30,612 --> 01:52:32,688
- It must be tight.
- Yeah, right there.

1240
01:52:33,239 --> 01:52:36,157
- I never thought I'd get this far.
- Make two of us.

1241
01:52:36,242 --> 01:52:37,986
Wouldn't it be great if I won?

1242
01:52:38,119 --> 01:52:41,987
- It'd be great if you survive.
- What do you mean "survive"?

1243
01:52:42,457 --> 01:52:46,537
- I'm fine as long as I don't move.
- You've got to move now, they're starting.

1244
01:52:46,669 --> 01:52:49,873
Are they starting now?
What do you mean "survive"?

1245
01:52:51,049 --> 01:52:54,418
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1246
01:52:54,510 --> 01:52:57,962
<i>... may I have your attention, please.</i>

1247
01:52:58,139 --> 01:53:03,382
<i>This is the first semi-final match
of the afternoon.</i>

John Lawrence of the Cobra Kai.</i>

1249

Under-18 Golden Trophy.</i>

1250

<i>He'll be facing Darryl Vidal
of the Locust Valley Karate Club.</i>

1251
01:53:20,578 --> 01:53:25,240
<i>Three points wins.
Contestants, please come to the ring.</i>

1252
01:53:25,792 --> 01:53:27,784
<i>Good luck, gentlemen.</i>

1253
01:53:29,879 --> 01:53:31,671
Go get him, Johnny.

1254
01:53:32,549 --> 01:53:34,091
Show him what you're made of.

1255
01:53:34,551 --> 01:53:36,508
Face me, gentlemen. Bow.

1256
01:53:37,178 --> 01:53:40,049
Face. Bow. Ready?

1257
01:53:41,808 --> 01:53:42,922
Come on, Johnny.

1258
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:47,686
Fast, Johnny. Come on. Do it.

1259
01:53:52,694 --> 01:53:54,437
One point, Lawrence.

1260
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:05,622
Lawrence, back on the line.

1261
01:54:05,748 --> 01:54:07,077
Way to go!

1262
01:54:07,208 --> 01:54:08,750
Are you all right?

1263
01:54:09,043 --> 01:54:10,241
I'm okay.

1264
01:54:12,547 --> 01:54:14,089
One point, Lawrence.

1265
01:54:18,845 --> 01:54:20,802
Good point, Johnny!

1266
01:54:22,724 --> 01:54:24,597
Point Lawrence. Winner!

1267
01:54:28,021 --> 01:54:33,263
<i>The next semi-final determines
who will face the defending champion.</i>

1268
01:54:33,693 --> 01:54:40,609
<i>Daniel LaRusso, of the Miyagi-do Karate.</i>

1269
01:54:41,951 --> 01:54:43,327
Bobby...

01:54:43,870 --> 01:54:45,827
...I want him out of commission.

1271

<i>Sensei, I can beat this guy.</i>

1272
01:54:50,251 --> 01:54:54,000
- I don't want him beaten.
- But I'll be disqualified!

1273
01:54:54,297 --> 01:54:56,124
Out of commission.

1274
01:54:59,844 --> 01:55:02,596
<i>Let's go, fellas. Good luck.</i>

1275
01:55:12,357 --> 01:55:14,433
Do what you got to do, Bobby!

1276
01:55:18,655 --> 01:55:22,818
Face. Bow. Ready?

1277
01:55:23,409 --> 01:55:26,197
Watch the control, gentlemen. Ready?

1278
01:55:34,671 --> 01:55:38,668
- I'm sorry! I didn't mean it.
- My leg!

1279
01:55:39,634 --> 01:55:43,714
- Mr. Miyagi, my leg hurts.
- Miyagi here.

1280
01:55:46,182 --> 01:55:50,511
<i>Bobby Brown of the Cobra Kai
has been disqualified...</i>

1281
01:55:50,895 --> 01:55:55,604
<i>... for excessive and deliberate contact.
Under rule 41-2...</i>

1282
01:55:56,484 --> 01:56:00,316
<i>... Daniel LaRusso has 15 minutes
to return to the ring.</i>

1283
01:56:00,405 --> 01:56:02,777
<i>If he is unable to return...</i>

1284
01:56:02,866 --> 01:56:07,159
<i>... John Lawrence will win by default.</i>

1285
01:56:12,083 --> 01:56:13,910
I'll inform the judges.

1286
01:56:15,253 --> 01:56:16,996
You did well out there, young man.

1287
01:56:21,926 --> 01:56:22,957
Damn it!

1288
01:56:23,094 --> 01:56:25,252
Honey, forget it.

1289
01:56:25,388 --> 01:56:27,594
You were great.

1290
01:56:28,099 --> 01:56:30,175
I couldn't be prouder.

1291
01:56:30,643 --> 01:56:32,387
It was just bad luck.

1292
01:56:32,478 --> 01:56:35,266
You would have won
if they hadn't cheated.

1293
01:56:35,398 --> 01:56:37,723
Just leave me alone for a minute.

1294
01:56:37,817 --> 01:56:39,311
We'll be outside.

1295
01:56:44,532 --> 01:56:46,192
Mr. Miyagi...

1296
01:56:48,828 --> 01:56:51,070
...you think I had a chance of winning?

1297
01:56:51,206 --> 01:56:52,783
Win, lose, no matter.

1298
01:56:52,874 --> 01:56:54,783
That's not what I mean.

1299
01:56:59,589 --> 01:57:01,582
Had good chance.

1300
01:57:02,550 --> 01:57:05,468
Can you fix my leg with that thing you do?

1301
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:08,009
No need fight anymore.

1302
01:57:08,181 --> 01:57:11,632
- You proved a point.
- What, that I can take a beating?

1303
01:57:11,935 --> 01:57:15,635
Every time I see those guys,
they'll know they got the best of me.

1304
01:57:17,398 --> 01:57:21,859
I'll never have balance that way,
not with them, not with Ali...

1305
01:57:25,532 --> 01:57:26,942
...not with me.

1306
01:57:31,621 --> 01:57:32,652
What?

1307
01:57:35,667 --> 01:57:37,042
Close eye.

1308
01:57:57,397 --> 01:58:02,604
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the moment we've been waiting for.</i>

1309
01:58:05,697 --> 01:58:08,069
<i>Daniel LaRusso's going to fight?</i>

1310
01:58:08,324 --> 01:58:10,898
<i>Daniel LaRusso's going to fight!</i>

1311
01:58:11,286 --> 01:58:15,330
<i>This is what it's all about, folks.
You know it.</i>

1312
01:58:16,332 --> 01:58:18,159
<i>How's the leg, son?</i>

1313
01:58:20,253 --> 01:58:22,495
<i>All right. What a man!</i>

1314
01:58:22,922 --> 01:58:25,247
<i>The final match to determine...</i>

1315
01:58:25,341 --> 01:58:28,342
<i>... who'll emerge victor and champion...</i>

1316
01:58:28,469 --> 01:58:32,763
<i>... of the All Valley Under-18
Karate Championship.</i>

1317
01:58:32,932 --> 01:58:36,099
<i>Daniel LaRusso, Miyaji-do Karate...</i>

1318
01:58:36,811 --> 01:58:38,685
<i>Miyagi-do.</i>

1319
01:58:38,813 --> 01:58:41,102
<i>Miyagi-do Karate.</i>

1320
01:58:41,274 --> 01:58:44,524
<i>... versus John Lawrence of the Cobra Kai.</i>

1321
01:58:44,611 --> 01:58:47,612
<i>Three points wins. Good luck, boys.</i>

1322
01:58:48,281 --> 01:58:51,068
Come on, Daniel!
You've got this guy. You can do it.

1323
01:58:58,208 --> 01:58:59,999
Face me. Bow.

1324
01:59:00,168 --> 01:59:03,453
Face off. Bow. Ready?

1325
01:59:13,097 --> 01:59:14,295
That's okay, Johnny.

1326
01:59:14,390 --> 01:59:16,050
Lawrence, return.

1327
01:59:17,518 --> 01:59:19,345
One point, LaRusso.

1328
01:59:19,437 --> 01:59:20,718
You're dead.

1329
01:59:27,362 --> 01:59:28,856
Daniel, you've got him!

1330
01:59:35,620 --> 01:59:38,537
<i>Point! Jab! That's two for LaRusso.</i>

1331
01:59:39,415 --> 01:59:42,452
<i>Time out. Go to your sensei.</i>

1332
01:59:42,585 --> 01:59:44,245
Turn, kneel.

1333
01:59:44,379 --> 01:59:46,751
Johnny, you're a creampuff!

1334
01:59:47,882 --> 01:59:49,080
Sweep the leg.

1335
01:59:51,636 --> 01:59:53,593
You have a problem with that?

1336
01:59:55,682 --> 01:59:56,962
<i>No, Sensei.</i>

1337
01:59:59,018 --> 02:00:00,394
No mercy.

1338
02:00:09,195 --> 02:00:10,606
One more!

1339
02:00:11,364 --> 02:00:14,365
Two points LaRusso. Lawrence nothing.

1340
02:00:22,333 --> 02:00:25,998
<i>One point Lawrence. 2-1, LaRusso.</i>

1341
02:00:46,941 --> 02:00:50,476
Kick to the side. One point Lawrence. 2-2.

1342
02:00:58,244 --> 02:01:00,486
Out of bounds. Come back in.

1343
02:01:02,624 --> 02:01:04,166
Destroy him, Johnny!

1344
02:01:04,250 --> 02:01:06,539
Come on, Daniel, you can do it!

1345
02:01:27,982 --> 02:01:30,983
Come on, Daniel. Be strong.

1346
02:01:33,279 --> 02:01:35,071
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1347
02:01:35,406 --> 02:01:38,858
<i>Whoever wins the next point
will be our new champion.</i>

1348
02:01:43,665 --> 02:01:45,373
Finish him, Johnny!

1349
02:01:53,925 --> 02:01:56,795
It's over, Johnny! You did it!

1350
02:02:00,223 --> 02:02:02,180
Are you okay? Can you go on?

1351
02:02:02,308 --> 02:02:05,511
Get him a body bag!

1352
02:02:08,022 --> 02:02:10,727
Warning for illegal contact to the knee.

1353
02:02:16,281 --> 02:02:18,154
Finish him!

1354
02:02:27,125 --> 02:02:28,667
Winner!

1355
02:02:38,761 --> 02:02:41,431
<i>The new champion!</i>

1356
02:02:42,640 --> 02:02:46,056
- You're all right, LaRusso.
- Thanks a lot.

1357
02:02:50,940 --> 02:02:54,356
Mr. Miyagi, we did it. All right!
