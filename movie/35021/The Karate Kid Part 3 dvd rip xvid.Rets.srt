1
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,720
<i>Fear does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?</i>

2
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,000
<i>No, Sensei!</i>

3
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,000
<i>Pain does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?</i>

4
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,280
<i>No, Sensei!</i>

5
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,280
<i>Defeat does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?</i>

6
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,720
<i>No, Sensei!</i>

7
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,800
<i>Fear does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?</i>

8
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,160
<i>No, Sensei!</i>

9
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,280
<i>Pain does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?</i>

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,680
<i>No, Sensei!</i>

11
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,160
<i>Defeat does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?</i>

12
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,640
<i>No, Sensei!</i>

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,240
Prepare!

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,760
We do not train to be merciful here.
Mercy is for the weak.

15
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,440
Here, on the street, in competition,
a man confronts you, he's the enemy.

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,320
An enemy deserves no mercy.
What is the problem, Mr. Lawrence?

17
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,720
Class, we have visitors.

18
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,880
I hear you jumped
some of my students last night.

19
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,200
Afraid the facts mixed up.

20
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,000
Now you get your boy on the mat
or you and I will have a major problem.

21
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,440
<i>Too much advantage, your dojo.</i>

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,400
Name a place.

23
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,320
Tournament.

24
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,800
Come on, Johnny, kill him!

25
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,440
<i>Point! Chop! That's two for LaRusso!</i>

26
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,040
Time out, time out.

27
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,400
<i>Go to your sensei. Turn. Kneel.</i>

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,160
Hey, Johnny, you're a cream-puff!

29
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,160
Sweep the leg.

30
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,080
You have a problem with that?

31
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,520
<i>No, Sensei.</i>

32
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,560
No mercy.

33
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,480
Warning for illegal contact to the knees.

34
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,960
Ready?

35
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,080
No mercy! No mercy!

36
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,880
Weigh the fist, Johnny.

37
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,320
Finish him!

38
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,560
Winner!

39
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,000
Now who's the loser?

40
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,760
You're really sick, man.

41
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,960
How does second place feel now?

42
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,000
- He can't breathe.
- Mind your business.

43
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,280
<i>- You're gonna kill him.
- Sensei, please. You're hurting him.</i>

44
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,480
He's sorry, okay? He really is.

45
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,960
Let him go.

46
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,080
Beat it, slope, or you're next.

47
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,520
"Mercy is for the weak.

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,520
"We do not train to be merciful here.

49
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,280
"A man face you, he is enemy.

50
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,920
"Enemy deserve no mercy."

51
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,160
<i>Come, Daniel-san.</i>

52
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,880
Time go home.

53
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,920
<i>- You could have killed him, couldn't you?
- Hai.</i>

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,320
Why didn't you then?

55
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,040
<i>Because, Daniel-san,
for person with no forgiveness in heart...</i>

56
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,920
<i>... living even worse punishment
than death.</i>

57
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,840
<i>Sensei Kreese, this is Pat Johnson
from the All Valley Tournament.</i>

58
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,800
<i>We're sorry you lost all your students.</i>

59
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,760
<i>I guess the Cobra Kai won't
enter the tournament this year.</i>

60
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,360
<i>We've made repeated requests
for payments of dues...</i>

61
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,640
<i>... but since you've failed to respond...</i>

62
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,800
<i>... we have to drop the Cobra Kai
from our membership rolls.</i>

63
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,880
<i>If you have any questions, give me a call.
Have a nice day.</i>

64
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,680
<i>Mr. Kreese, this is Pacific Bell.</i>

65
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,800
<i>This is the final call regarding your bill,
and if you do not pay immediately...</i>

66
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,880
Mr. Kreese, good morning.
What a surprise. Some coffee?

67
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,440
- Where's the boss?
- He's upstairs.

68
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,720
Thanks.

69
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,000
Come on!

70
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,240
You're telegraphing that wheel kick.

71
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,560
Johnny!

72
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,840
What a surprise, man!

73
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,040
Yes!

74
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,320
What's this? You moving in?

75
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,920
This is "I give up." I came to say good-bye.

76
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,440
<i>- Here are the dojo keys.
- What are you talking about?</i>

77
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,080
I'll pay you that back rent soon.

78
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,160
You think I bought that place for the rent?
I bought it for you.

79
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,320
- Mr. Silver?
- What?

80
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,880
The plutonium deal.

81
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,120
Johnny, every business has a slump
at one time or another.

82
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,520
Ten years ago
nuclear was the preferred waste.

83
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,320
You could dump it anywhere.
Now, everybody's a detective.

84
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,200
I'm lucky if I make one deal a year
without being indicted.

85
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,280
Thank you.

86
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,520
Let's get some air.

87
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,520
It's been nine months since a student
walked through my doors.

88
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,240
You're not listening to me.
Come on, snap out of it.

89
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,560
I can't.

90
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,320
I'm broke and I'm going nowhere.

91
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,720
You're wrong.

92
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,120
You're going to Tahiti.

93
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,160
Now.

94
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,960
All right, I've made up my mind.

95
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,280
This slope, Miyagi, and that punk kid...

96
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,200
...I'll get them for what they did to you.

97
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,560
They made you suffer,
so I'll make them suffer.

98
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,000
When I think they've suffered enough,
then I start with the pain.

99
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,440
- Terry, you don't have to do that.
- Don't have to? I want to.

100
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,520
It's not over. We're Cobra Kai.

101
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,360
Come on, say it. Cobra Kai.

102
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,280
Say it! Cobra Kai.

103
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,600
- Never dies.
- You bet your ass.

104
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,720
- I owe you, man.
- You don't owe me anything.

105
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,360
I don't owe you anything?
What about Vietnam?

106
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,360
How many times did you save my ass?

107
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,080
I don't know. I lost count.

108
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,840
Get the hell out of here.

109
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,840
Have a good trip, Captain.

110
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,360
<i>The White Zone is for the immediate
loading and unloading of passengers only.</i>

111
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,560
Smog.

112
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,880
Smells like home, huh, Mr. Miyagi?

113
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,440
<i>Daniel-san,
why mother not here to meet you?</i>

114
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,400
You tell her right flight number?

115
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,280
I told her the right flight.
I just told her the wrong day.

116
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,600
I told her we were coming in tomorrow.
She loves surprises.

117
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,040
Hope so.

118
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,400
We take taxi apartment house.
Then Miyagi go back to work.

119
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,040
<i>106 Los Angeles. Crank it up!</i>

120
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,400
What are you doing in my cab?

121
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,800
- We just came from the airport.
- I thought that was the cab I ordered.

122
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,640
- Mrs. Milo, what's going on?
- What does it seem? Progress.

123
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,960
I got a message for you from your mother.

124
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,200
I told you that bum would sell the place
and you'd be out of a job someday.

125
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,000
You wouldn't listen to me.

126
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,600
- What's the message?
- What message?

127
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,920
- The one from my mother.
- She said call her at your Uncle Louie's.

128
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,040
No worry nothing, Mrs. LaRusso.

129
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,560
<i>Daniel-san room all finished.</i>

130
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,040
Yeah, I take good care of him.
You just look out Uncle Louie.

131
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,600
I might be here for a few months.

132
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,360
A 70-year-old man gets emphysema,
it's no joke, you know.

133
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,040
Are you sure there's no problem
for him to stay with you?

134
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,480
No problem.

135
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,640
Pleasure.

136
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,280
<i>Mr. Miyagi, thank you.</i>

137
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,000
<i>Welcome. Bye-bye. Here Daniel-san.</i>

138
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,480
Nice mama.

139
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,800
You sure you don't need me there?

140
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,760
<i>No. You stay with Mr. Miyagi
and start college.</i>

141
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,240
I can't believe it, "Mr. College Man."
When's registration?

142
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,600
<i>It's this Tuesday.
And classes start Thursday.</i>

143
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,440
And when is Kumiko arriving?

144
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,360
She's not.

145
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,720
She got this great job
with a dance company in Tokyo.

146
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,200
I guess she just couldn't say no, so...

147
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,000
You're disappointed, huh?

148
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,840
Yep. But that's life, I guess.
I'll survive.

149
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,000
You'll do more than just survive.

150
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,880
I gotta go, okay?

151
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,240
Listen, Uncle Louie says hi,
and I love you.

152
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,960
Okay, say hi to Uncle Louie.
I love you, too.

153
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,200
The little maple's still in there.
I'll get it.

154
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,120
No. I go.

155
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,440
Mr. Miyagi, you okay?

156
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,680
Just remembering.

157
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,760
I'll bet there are a lot of memories
here for you.

158
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,160
So what are you going to do now?

159
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,920
Don't know.

160
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,880
<i>Well, did you ever think about
opening a bonsai store?</i>

161
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,400
<i>Hai, Daniel-san.</i>

162
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,440
In my dream.

163
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,720
My retirement.

164
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,400
What do you call this?

165
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,520
Call "time to go."

166
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,240
<i>You know, I've been thinking about
the bonsai shop idea.</i>

167
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,360
You already have all the stock.
How hard can it be?

168
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,400
<i>Not too hard, Daniel-san...</i>

169
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,480
...if Miyagi have money for lease,
deposit, fix-up.

170
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,480
But since we build house
for Yukie in Okinawa...

171
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,520
...money very short supply.

172
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,760
"Supply"?

173
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,560
Supplies are us.

174
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,840
<i>Thank you, Daniel-san,
but that not money.</i>

175
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,680
It looks like money. Smells like money.
Good money. Smell that.

176
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,640
Smell like college education.

177
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,880
I know, Mr. Miyagi,
but I have a great idea...

178
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,400
<i>Daniel-san.</i>

179
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,080
No idea.

180
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,240
Discussion closed.

181
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,640
But what about your dream?

182
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,000
And, Mr. Miyagi, no offence,
but if you miss the train this time...

183
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,720
...there may not be another one
for a long time.

184
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,600
Then Miyagi take bus.

185
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,280
Revenge? Of course you want revenge.
I'm gonna get it for you.

186
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,160
<i>The day you step off the plane, you're
the biggest dojo operator in the valley.</i>

187
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,000
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

188
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,080
I bought 20 locations today.
Yours, 100 percent.

189
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,080
You are back, my man,
bigger and badder than ever.

190
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,920
<i>You're a sweetheart, that's great!</i>

191
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,160
But what about those two jerks?

192
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,560
<i>Those two jerks are taking up
100 percent of my time from now on.</i>

193
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,440
So just have patience.
I'm just getting things rolling.

194
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,360
When I'm finished with that kid,
he'll be begging me to be his teacher.

195
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,400
You know what he's gonna learn from me?

196
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,160
Pain in every part of his body
and fear in every part of his mind.

197
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,360
And here's the kicker:
he's gonna thank me for it.

198
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,920
What about the old man?

199
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,600
Him I hurt for the kid.

200
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,080
By the time that little twerp
steps into the ring to defend his title...

201
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,760
...I'm gonna have him thinking
he's invincible.

202
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,000
Then he's gonna find out
what pain and fear really mean...

203
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,120
...right in front of a thousand people.

204
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,120
How do you know he'll compete?

205
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,040
He'll compete. Don't worry about it.
You just have fun.

206
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,720
<i>Go give Mimona and her girlfriend
a squeeze for me.</i>

207
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,000
How do you know about her?

208
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,480
I know.

209
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,880
<i>Anything else you want?</i>

210
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,440
Yeah.

211
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,000
Make his knuckles bleed.

212
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,960
I like that, Johnny.
I'm gonna use that.

213
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,200
I'm going to be working full-time
on this from now on.

214
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,360
Very good, sir.

215
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,480
No, it's too nice.
I gotta look poor.

216
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,160
This isn't bad. Fix the collar.
Make me look humble.

217
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,160
- About the Borneo call?
- All right, but that's the last one.

218
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,560
For the next few weeks,
my business is revenge.

219
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,320
Everything is in place, sir.

220
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,960
All right,
let's see what you've got for me.

221
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,080
Cute but wrong.

222
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,000
It's got no character.

223
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,640
A truck.

224
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,880
Yeah, I like it. Make sure it runs.

225
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,840
Yes, sir.

226
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,600
- Where are the magazines I ordered?
- Right here, sir.

227
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,000
- Have a very pleasant evening, sir.
- Thank you, Margaret.

228
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,160
"Karate's bad boy.

229
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,760
"Mike Barnes."

230
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,160
Perfect.

231
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,880
Mr. Miyagi, I'm home.

232
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,480
<i>Daniel-san, just in time.</i>

233
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,640
How was fishing?

234
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,480
We find out pretty soon.

235
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,520
So, how first day at college?

236
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,840
College?

237
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,560
College...

238
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,320
College is...
Well, you know college, Mr. Miyagi.

239
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,000
It's a place that I didn't go to today.

240
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,360
What?

241
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,040
Mr. Miyagi,
may all your dreams come true.

242
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,040
What this?

243
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,240
There's only one way to find out.

244
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,440
All right, I'll tell you.

245
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,440
It's my college diploma.

246
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,880
- What?
- I'm only joking.

247
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,480
<i>Daniel-san, you have sense humour.</i>

248
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,760
"Lease."

249
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,240
<i>For your new bonsai store.
Congratulations.</i>

250
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,040
"One month security, two month rent."

251
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,760
Yes. With just enough left over
for renovations, if we're careful.

252
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,120
<i>Daniel-san, thank you very much,
but cannot accept.</i>

253
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,120
But it's your dream, Mr. Miyagi.
Why not?

254
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,920
Because money in pocket
was not for Miyagi dream.

255
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,120
Was for college education.

256
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,120
I know, just listen to me for a minute.

257
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,640
I know me. I just can't take courses
to take courses.

258
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,280
I'll get bored.
Once it happens, forget about it.

259
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,960
It's bye-bye college.

260
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,040
I've been going to school non-stop
since I'm five. I could use the break.

261
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,640
<i>- I don't know, Daniel-san.
- I do.</i>

262
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,800
- Just come with me a second.
- Where?

263
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,520
- Come with me.
- What about fish?

264
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,960
The fish is not going anyplace.
That fish is dead.

265
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,760
What a moment!

266
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,080
You are now crossing over
to the right side of the tracks.

267
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,520
- What that?
- That's opportunity knocking.

268
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,320
Straight ahead. Right up there.

269
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,120
Your dream come true,
and there's plenty of free parking.

270
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,680
Right here, Mr. Miyagi.

271
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,800
- This place?
- This place. Wait till you see it up close.

272
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,720
So, is this the opportunity
of a lifetime or what?

273
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,800
Now, I know you're worried
about this area...

274
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,440
...but the landlord says
this neighbourhood is up and coming.

275
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,440
We're in on the ground floor over here.
Look, a pottery shop across the street.

276
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,600
<i>We could set a deal,
get some planters made up for the bonsai.</i>

277
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,520
Wait till you see inside, man.
This is going to be great.

278
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,440
This is going to be great.

279
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,160
Come on in.

280
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,800
Mr. Miyagi, welcome to your dream.

281
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,880
Now don't let this throw you.
Looks can be deceiving.

282
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,720
We have to think potential here.

283
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,520
Think potential, all right?

284
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,880
You see all this stuff? Everything in here?

285
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,840
You own it. Everything.
It's all yours. You could use this stuff.

286
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,080
This is good wood.
We can make shelves out of this stuff.

287
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,680
Back here,
I thought this would be a great spot...

288
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,360
<i>...up here, to do like a bonsai display.</i>

289
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,880
All those pine trees you have?
We could show them in different stages.

290
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,160
You know, the possibilities are endless.

291
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,560
Over here, right,
I thought this would be a great spot...

292
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,200
...for a little work area.

293
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,680
<i>Over here we got like a bonsai hospital.
The little guys get sick. Take care of them.</i>

294
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,240
I work for free. And I thought of a name.

295
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,480
Check it out.

296
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,720
"Mr. Miyagi's Little Trees."

297
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,320
Simple, direct, catchy.

298
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,000
It doesn't look it now,
but this place is a gold mine.

299
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,560
I know you can make it work, Mr. Miyagi.
If anyone can, you can.

300
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,640
What did I do? Did I forget something?

301
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,840
Well, what did I miss?

302
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,320
Your name on lease, next to mine.

303
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,800
- Partner.
- Partner?

304
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,240
Yes! Mr. Miyagi, this is gonna be great.

305
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,960
You're welcome.

306
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,960
What?

307
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,800
Don't bullshit me.

308
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
What do you mean
you can't dump it in Borneo?

309
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,120
Who in Borneo
knows what chloride sludge is?

310
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,320
Just do it!

311
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,760
Do it!

312
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,680
Call me when it's dumped.

313
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,080
Where were we, Margaret?

314
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,160
"And, in conclusion,
I reject your final offer.

315
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,600
"If you proceed,
I'll sue your collective asses accordingly."

316
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,480
Best to Lorna and the kids. Sincerely...

317
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,520
Yeah?

318
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,360
Good, bring him in.

319
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,560
What else?

320
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,960
The grand jury.
What do you intend to do about them?

321
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,560
Bribe them, as usual.

322
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,760
Lighten up, Margaret.

323
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,200
- Who's the DA on the case?
- Mr. Cole.

324
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,320
Good.

325
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,920
Let's invite Willie to dinner Tuesday night.
We'll have his favourite.

326
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,600
- Poached salmon.
- Very well.

327
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,920
Mr. Silver?

328
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,720
You must be Mike Barnes. Welcome to LA.

329
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,000
Thank you for bringing me down,
Mr. Silver.

330
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,920
Milos, call the boys.

331
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,640
This place is intense.

332
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,080
- Consider it home.
- Thanks.

333
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,080
Snake, Dennis.

334
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,160
Mike Barnes.

335
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,880
Dennis will take care of your training.
Snake takes care of everything else.

336
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,480
If you're looking to be a bad boy in LA,
Snake's the boy to be bad with.

337
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,880
You know it.

338
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,120
You get a weekly draw and a car.
Any questions?

339
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,440
Remember on the phone you said
if I come here...

340
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,320
...and I beat this LaRusso
in the All Valley Tournament...

341
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,400
<i>...that you'd give me 25 percent ownership
in your new dojos?</i>

342
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,640
Which I think is more than generous.

343
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,880
But I've been giving it some thought.

344
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,640
For me to do my absolute best,
which is what I want to do for you...

345
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,000
...l'm afraid I'm gonna need 50 percent.

346
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,200
Fifty percent?

347
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,280
Well, I don't know
if I can afford more than 35.

348
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,120
I understand. I guess I'd better get going.

349
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,120
It was nice meeting everybody.

350
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,880
- Do you fight as hard as you negotiate?
- Harder.

351
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,440
You got your 50 percent.

352
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,200
- And I get that in writing?
- By noon today.

353
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,480
You just bought yourself a champion.

354
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,240
You remember that.

355
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,440
- Snake, show him to his room.
- Yes, sir.

356
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,960
See you later, Mike.
Milos, my blue pinstripe.

357
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,840
So, what do you think?

358
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,320
He's obnoxious.

359
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,160
Yeah, he's perfect.

360
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,520
<i>Very good. This make special bonsai.</i>

361
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,920
<i>You really see a bonsai in here?</i>

362
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,360
Where?

363
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,560
Inside.

364
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,840
Inside?

365
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,800
<i>Hello, any bonsai in here?</i>

366
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,720
<i>Daniel-san, not inside. Inside you.</i>

367
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,200
Same place your karate come from.

368
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,200
But my karate comes from you.

369
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,600
Only root karate come from Miyagi.

370
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,680
<i>Just like bonsai choose own way grow.
Because the root is strong.</i>

371
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,320
You choose own way.
Do karate same reason.

372
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,520
Yeah, but I do it your way.

373
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,160
One day you do own way.

374
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,200
<i>Remember what you said before about
bonsai being free to grow as they choose?</i>

375
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,360
<i>All bonsai aren't free to choose.</i>

376
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,040
We tell them how to grow
by using clippers and then the wire.

377
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,960
<i>But, Daniel-san,
our bonsai not true bonsai.</i>

378
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,440
<i>True bonsai grow wild. Very rare.</i>

379
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,920
You ever seen any?

380
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,480
Okinawa.

381
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,960
What about here?

382
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,440
I only know of one.

383
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,400
What did it do, immigrate?

384
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,160
With Miyagi.
Only thing Miyagi bring from Okinawa.

385
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,080
Where's the tree now?

386
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,200
There.

387
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,920
Devil's Caldron.

388
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,800
Devil's Caldron?

389
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,160
<i>No can see bonsai from here.</i>

390
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,880
Good place. Very safe. Nobody bother.

391
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,440
Why did you put it
in such a hard place to get to?

392
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,440
<i>True original bonsai
worth many thousand dollar.</i>

393
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,240
<i>Come, time learn special
Miyagi-family kata.</i>

394
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,640
Now you ready.

395
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,240
<i>Like all bonsai found in tree,
all karate found in this kata.</i>

396
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,720
<i>Come, together we do kata.</i>

397
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,800
Hi, Mr. Miyagi.

398
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,760
I brought this tree,
the one you were working on this morning.

399
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,000
I thought you might want
to give it another try.

400
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,920
Thank you.

401
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,920
A change of scenery
might bring what's inside outside.

402
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,200
- Where should I put it?
- Over here.

403
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,040
Very good.

404
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,400
You've done a lot of work here.
This place is bigger than I thought.

405
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,920
- There's your charcoal.
- Thank you.

406
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,080
Perfect.

407
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,160
I hope you don't mind...

408
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,760
...but I opened that letter.

409
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,760
The one that came today
from the All Valley Tournament.

410
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,800
There's a new rule this year.

411
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,280
- Would you like to read about it?
- No.

412
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,760
That's okay because I got it memorised.
It says:

413
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,240
"Under the new rules...

414
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,520
"...the defending champion
only needs to fight in the final match."

415
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,800
Isn't that great?
That limits my fights to just one.

416
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,160
That's better
than what I had to put up with last year.

417
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,080
And let's face it, it's another year.

418
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,760
It's a year later.
I'm a lot more experienced.

419
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,120
So I think we should
seriously reconsider this.

420
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,240
- Right?
- Wrong!

421
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,480
Wrong?

422
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,560
<i>Should consider get
new pot for bonsai.</i>

423
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,920
I don't know what the big deal is.
I mean, what is your problem with this?

424
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,080
If karate used defend honour,
defend a life...

425
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,800
...karate means something.

426
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,760
If karate used defend plastic metal trophy...

427
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,000
...karate no mean nothing.

428
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,680
Understand?

429
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,680
I wish I did.

430
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,200
<i>Go find a nice pot for bonsai across street.</i>

431
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,000
Here's your pen.

432
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,240
Before I forget.

433
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:19,280
And if you have a minute,
just in case you change your mind...

434
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,880
...here's the application.

435
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,080
Okay?

436
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,480
It's no rush.
I mean, it says at the bottom...

437
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,600
We have a couple of weeks
before we have to send it in.

438
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,800
I'm sorry if I made it seem
like we had to do it today.

439
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,320
We have some time.

440
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,360
Hello?

441
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,480
Hi. Could you turn that off?

442
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,760
Sure.

443
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,080
Thanks.

444
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,520
Hang on, I'm almost finished.

445
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,720
That's okay.

446
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,720
It's okay. Take your time.

447
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,480
That's pretty cool.

448
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,800
Thanks.

449
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,960
So, what can I do for you?

450
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,200
Actually, I was looking to buy some pots.

451
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,280
Yeah, what size?

452
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,240
This would be good. Like this.

453
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,040
<i>They're for bonsai trees.
We're opening a shop across the street.</i>

454
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,080
Great. Welcome to the neighbourhood.

455
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,240
Thanks.

456
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,480
<i>Yeah, I love bonsai.</i>

457
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,880
They're so perfect, you know?

458
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,400
Maybe when we get our trees in
you could come visit the shop.

459
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,120
And meet my partner, too.

460
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,160
I haven't even really met you yet.

461
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,840
I'm sorry.

462
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,760
- Daniel LaRusso.
- Jessica Andrews. Hi.

463
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,240
Hi. Is that you in that...

464
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,080
Yep, that's me.

465
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,760
What happened to the guy
who lost his head?

466
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,520
Elizabeth Anne Rooney happened to him.
The traitor.

467
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,280
The pots?

468
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,200
You know what we could do?

469
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,280
<i>Could you put like a bonsai tree
on the side of the pot?</i>

470
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,200
- It's sort of like our trademark.
- Like embossed?

471
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,000
Right on the side.
I'll draw a picture of it for you.

472
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,000
That would be great.

473
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,160
- Jessica, come on. I'm late, hurry up.
- Listen, I got to deal with this guy.

474
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,880
Thanks, I'll see you soon then.

475
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,320
How soon?

476
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,040
How soon? Well, I don't know.

477
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,680
- Busy tonight?
- No.

478
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
No?

479
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,240
Well, then I'll see you tonight.
If that's okay with you?

480
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,920
Okay. About 7:00?

481
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,920
Well, sure. 7:00 is good.

482
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,080
I just live right upstairs,
so go around the side, okay?

483
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,400
- I'll see you around the side, 7:00.
- Bye-bye.

484
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,200
Charles is going to get angry.
Open up the gate.

485
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,320
You found it, huh?

486
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,480
Thanks to you.

487
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,920
Thanks to me? I didn't do anything.

488
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,720
That looks great.

489
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,760
You find something?

490
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,800
Yeah. Yeah, actually I did.
I found a date.

491
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,800
You didn't send me over there
just to look at pots, did you?

492
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,360
Yeah, I knew it.

493
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,080
Did you sign it?

494
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,880
You didn't sign it.

495
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,320
No.

496
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,640
I understand your feelings on this.
But you have to understand mine.

497
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,080
This is the biggest thing
I've ever done in my life.

498
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,160
I'm proud of this title.
Why can't I defend it?

499
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,840
<i>Daniel-san,
you no look answer Miyagi.</i>

500
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:49,400
<i>Just like a bonsai live inside the tree,
answer live inside of you.</i>

501
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,680
The only thing living inside me right now
is a lot of confusion.

502
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,800
I have the chance
to be the champion again.

503
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,320
- All I have to do is put my signature to it.
- Or match to it.

504
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,560
A match to it?

505
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,960
Then you watch confusion disappear
with the smoke.

506
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,080
"442nd."

507
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,760
What are you doing here?

508
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,000
- Forget something.
- What?

509
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,400
For shop. Bring good luck.

510
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,560
Well, I hope it brings good customers, too.

511
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,240
<i>Daniel-san look good.</i>

512
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,640
Thanks for the shirt. I love it, man.

513
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,880
What doing?

514
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,400
I've been thinking about what you said,
and I decided to take your advice.

515
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,040
I'm going to let my confusion
go up in smoke.

516
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,600
I'm not entering the tournament.

517
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,720
I want my karate and your karate
to mean something.

518
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,360
<i>Good decision, Daniel-san.</i>

519
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,680
This way no more bruises.
Save money on Band-Aid.

520
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,400
Get out of here.
They never laid a hand on me last year.

521
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,280
Just an elbow, a few feet.

522
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,720
I'll never forget that knee to the groin.
That was interesting.

523
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,960
I'll see you later, Mr. Miyagi.

524
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

525
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,680
So, you all set to go?

526
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,720
First I gotta tell you this.

527
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,840
After you hear this,
you just might change your mind.

528
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,560
What do you have, poison oak?

529
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,120
A boyfriend.

530
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,680
You see, he was in the headless picture.
You know, we broke up two months ago.

531
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,080
You mean Elizabeth Anne Rooney...

532
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,000
We were both a little dumb about it,
but we've been talking on the phone.

533
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,040
I don't know, we're gonna give it
another try when I go home.

534
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,640
- Where's home?
- Columbus. Ohio.

535
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,000
Yeah, I'm gonna go back
after Thanksgiving.

536
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,560
- I just didn't want to lead you on.
- No.

537
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,240
I did come on kind of strong.

538
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,480
No, don't worry about it. It's refreshing.
We could go Dutch.

539
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,960
That sounds great.

540
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,360
It's just that I've been here
for two months...

541
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,640
...with absolutely nothing to do
and I haven't even met any friends.

542
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,280
Meet your first friend.

543
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,680
All right.

544
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,200
Yeah, this is wild.

545
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,120
Wait till he hears about this one.

546
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,240
Who?

547
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,560
Mr. Miyagi. He's my partner.
You wanna meet him?

548
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,720
Yeah, why not?

549
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,000
You are about to meet the greatest guy.

550
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,960
This guy, he's funny, he's smart.
You got a problem, he's got the answer.

551
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,600
He's like no one you'll ever meet.

552
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,920
On top of that,
he happens to be my best friend.

553
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,320
Why do you call him "mister"?

554
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,480
Mr. Miyagi.

555
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,120
Meet Jessica Andrews from
Columbus, Ohio, and across the street.

556
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,160
This is Mr. Miyagi
from Okinawa and Reseda.

557
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,040
- How do you do?
- Hi.

558
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,000
- Jessica's gonna make those pots for us.
- Very good.

559
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,880
- Welcome to the neighbourhood.
- Thank you very much.

560
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,600
How's it going so far? Good?

561
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,640
I never know retirement
mean such hard work.

562
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,880
- You like to see inside shop?
- Yeah, I'd love to.

563
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,400
Partner show you around.
Don't forget lock up.

564
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,600
No, I won't.

565
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,560
- Good night. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

566
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,200
- I'll see you later.
- Bye-bye.

567
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,600
- You see why I call him "mister"?
- Yeah. He's nice.

568
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,520
He's the best. Come on in.

569
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,720
What's this?

570
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,000
That's Mr. Miyagi's.
He brought it for good luck.

571
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,120
What do you think?
It is going to be great.

572
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,720
- Yeah, it is.
- It needs a little work, but...

573
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,080
So where'd you meet him?

574
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,320
I met him when I moved out here.
He started teaching me karate.

575
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,600
Karate?

576
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,520
- You do karate?
- Yeah, I do.

577
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,720
He doesn't really look like
the karate-teacher type.

578
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,480
He doesn't act like it either.

579
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,320
Half the time he teaches me stuff,
I don't know what it is.

580
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,480
What do you mean?

581
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,000
It's like that vase
you were making this morning.

582
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,360
He'll make a whole karate lesson
out of that.

583
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,920
No, I'm not kidding.

584
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,520
Show me how you were making that...

585
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,680
- You go up and then you go down.
- Okay, now you do that.

586
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,200
Okay, go up.

587
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,400
Now, okay, right, see just like that.
Now go down.

588
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,800
Okay, now do that again. Go up.
I'm a mugger.

589
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,440
I'm gonna grab you,
now grab the back of my head.

590
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,480
Then pull down and bring your knee up.

591
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,960
Room for one more down there?

592
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,760
- What are you doing? We're not open.
- The door was.

593
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,360
I meant for business, pal.

594
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,920
I didn't come here for business.
Came here to talk to you.

595
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,560
We heard you weren't entering
the All Valley this year.

596
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,480
Is that true, Daniel?

597
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,320
- Where'd you hear that?
- Is it true?

598
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,960
Yeah, that's true. So what?

599
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,560
- We'd like you to reconsider.
- Is that why you guys came down here?

600
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,520
- I need your title.
- Then enter the tournament and go for it.

601
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,920
Maybe you didn't hear me.
I need your title.

602
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,400
You don't enter
and that effects my financial future.

603
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,280
I won't let that happen. Get it?

604
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,720
I have nothing to prove.
I have no reason to fight.

605
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,480
I do. I got some money to make.
Give me the application.

606
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,280
Forget it. I'm not going to fight...

607
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,240
Sign it!

608
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,640
You sign it, man!

609
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,000
Come on, man! Right now!

610
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,200
Let's go, punk!

611
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,160
Let LaRusso sleep on it.
Come on. Mike!

612
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,880
Yeah, you sleep on it.

613
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,320
And you can dream about me.

614
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,160
You slimeball.

615
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,840
Slimeball? That's cute.
Did your mother teach you that?

616
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,440
Come on, Mike.

617
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,880
You'll have to excuse him.
He's usually a very mellow guy.

618
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,480
See you later.

619
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,640
Do you know those creeps?

620
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,240
No.

621
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,960
And I wanna keep it that way.

622
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,360
Excuse me.

623
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,080
Mr. Miyagi?

624
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,120
My name is Terry Silver.

625
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,800
My master is Kim San Jang
of South Korea.

626
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,120
My teacher sends his respects.

627
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,920
<i>John Kreese of the Cobra Kai dojo
was our school's number one student.</i>

628
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,800
Word reached us in Korea
only two months ago...

629
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,240
...about what happened last year
at the tournament.

630
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,120
My teacher sends his apologies
for John Kreese's dishonourable actions.

631
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,880
Accept apology.

632
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,040
I was sent here
to help John regain balance.

633
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,960
Hope you can be successful.

634
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,720
Unfortunately, I arrived too late.

635
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,560
I buried John last week.

636
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,320
He's dead? What happened?

637
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,920
His doctor said it was cardiac arrest,
but I knew John better than anyone.

638
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,400
Karate was his life.

639
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,160
And after he lost all his students,
it just broke his heart.

640
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,080
John was a hero.
He wasn't always like what you saw.

641
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,680
He saved my life in Vietnam.

642
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,840
War does something to a man.

643
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,440
You had to have been there
to know what I mean.

644
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,840
Have been.

645
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,360
Do know.

646
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,560
442nd?

647
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,640
Man!

648
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,360
More medals of honour
came out of the 442nd...

649
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,720
...than all World War II put together.

650
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,760
I bet you've been there.

651
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,880
Is this your student? The champion?

652
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,200
Yeah.

653
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,320
Our apologies to you, too.

654
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,480
John had vowed
to come and apologise himself.

655
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,120
He planned...

656
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,760
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to interrupt your training.

657
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,760
Mr. Silver...

658
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,120
...very sorry to hear about death of friend.

659
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,560
Me, too.

660
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,360
Thank you.

661
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,240
God, that's too bad.

662
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,320
<i>Too bad, Daniel-san.</i>

663
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,040
<i>Come, we continue kata.</i>

664
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,880
Hello?

665
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,480
- Eat yet?
- No, I haven't.

666
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,720
I was supposed to dine with my Aunt Pat.
She owns the shop.

667
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,480
She had to do some things, so I got stuck
with all this macaroni and cheese.

668
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,600
Macaroni and cheese?
You know what I like!

669
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,600
I grew up on macaroni and cheese.

670
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,360
I never say no
when it comes to macaroni and cheese.

671
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,480
- Here, have a seat.
- Thanks.

672
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,720
I used to eat this stuff by the ton.

673
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,440
I want you to try this, okay?
And be honest.

674
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,440
Okay.

675
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,160
On a scale of one to ten, I'd give it as...

676
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,560
...eleven.

677
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,680
Let's eat. I'm starved.

678
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,760
I hope you like this.

679
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,080
I'm not sure if this is
exactly what you wanted, but...

680
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,000
Hey, this came out great.

681
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,600
- Look at the tree. You got it just right.
- Good.

682
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,720
- Wait until Mr. Miyagi sees it.
- Do you think he'll like it?

683
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,720
Like it? He's gonna love it. Here.

684
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,120
- I have something for you.
- For me?

685
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,040
What is this?

686
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,360
The Down Stairs? What is that?

687
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,480
It's a dance club. Yeah, it's great.
It's got live music.

688
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,120
It's for the night before you go back home.

689
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,880
I figured it would be
a nice going-away present.

690
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,200
Daniel, that is so sweet.

691
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,880
Come on, guys. This isn't funny anymore.
Come on, turn on the lights.

692
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,040
Danny, I hope you got some good news
for my friend Mike here.

693
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,800
- I hope so too, Daniel.
- I told you.

694
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,480
I can't help you. Forget about it.
Where are you going?

695
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,440
You haven't signed the application yet.

696
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,920
I'm not signing the application.
I won't compete.

697
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,760
Take your friends and get out of here.

698
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,880
Dennis, he didn't sign it yet.

699
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,000
Come on, guys.
This is getting out of hand now.

700
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,760
- I'm not signing the application.
- Sure you are.

701
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,440
I'm not going to be there.
You're wasting your time.

702
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,080
- Take off, all right?
- You take off!

703
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,880
- Come on, Dennis, take him out!
- Put his eye out!

704
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,640
Come on!

705
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,960
Come on, punk!
Let's see what you've got!

706
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,520
Nice kick. Not bad.

707
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,720
Better. Good, but not good enough.

708
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,560
Come on, get up!

709
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,040
Why are you being so stubborn?

710
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,000
Don't do that!

711
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,920
I am running out of patience.
Now sign it and let's get on with it.

712
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,960
Stop it!

713
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,360
It's your ass!

714
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,360
Just get out of here!

715
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,640
- Save it for the tournament!
- Nail him!

716
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,960
Mike, come on, let's get out of here!

717
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,560
Come on, old man!

718
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,480
Mike, let's go!

719
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,600
Let's go! You wimp!

720
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,680
I'll be back, LaRusso.
I'm gonna get you.

721
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,640
You're finished!

722
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,040
You can't watch him forever, Buddha-head.

723
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,440
<i>So, Daniel-san, time take Jessica home.</i>

724
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,120
Yeah. Jessica, you all right?

725
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,240
Yeah. I just want to lie down.

726
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,320
I can't believe you're singing.

727
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,680
Forget it.

728
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,240
<i>Feel lucky, Daniel-san.</i>

729
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,280
Lucky? How could you feel lucky?

730
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,840
<i>Feel lucky. Bonsai tree not in shop.
Safe at home.</i>

731
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,160
That makes us real lucky.
I never felt luckier in my life.

732
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,720
<i>Daniel-san, we can rebuild the shop.</i>

733
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,760
Cannot rebuild stock.

734
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:00,440
<i>We sell a few trees, fix shoji screen,
start over again.</i>

735
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,600
What if those guys come back again?
What are we going to do then?

736
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,000
If they come back,
what are we going to do?

737
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,680
Just tell me,
what do we do if they come back?

738
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,640
Sing happy song.

739
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,400
Where are the trees?
Where'd you put the trees?

740
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,880
They stole them!

741
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,920
I can't believe it. They stole the trees.
Don't they get it?

742
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,600
I'm not going to sign this thing.
Mr. Miyagi, what are we going to do?

743
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,560
- Where are you going?
- Get fishing pole.

744
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,920
What?

745
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,280
Sometimes I don't get you.

746
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:57,760
The shop's wrecked. We've just been
robbed, and you're going fishing.

747
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,800
We're flat broke and you're going fishing.

748
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,960
You're just going to fluff it off?
Doesn't this even bother you?

749
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:08,000
<i>Daniel-san, sometime better be bothered
on full stomach than empty one.</i>

750
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,680
Great, another great thought, huh?
That really does me good.

751
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,240
You go fishing.
I'm going to the police to report it.

752
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:18,080
Show them the application
so they can arrest these jerks.

753
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,120
This is the '80s,
you gotta do something, Mr. Miyagi.

754
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,400
You can't be so damn passive.

755
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,880
Somebody's gotta do something
about these guys.

756
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,160
I bring the tournament application
to the police station.

757
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,080
As I walk in, they start laughing at me.

758
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,800
Finally the sergeant said,
"Son, we'll look into it."

759
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,360
We'll see. I hope.

760
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:56,080
I still think you should ask Mr. Miyagi
before going after his tree.

761
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,800
He wouldn't have hidden it
in the middle of nowhere...

762
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,840
...if he wanted people to dig it up.
- I don't have a choice.

763
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,240
If he doesn't sell this tree
we're looking for...

764
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,000
...he loses his business. He's broke.

765
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,120
His social security can barely cover
the expenses on his rowboat.

766
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,360
This tree is like money in the bank.

767
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,600
Great. So now we're robbing a bank.

768
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,440
How much do you think
this thing is worth?

769
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,920
<i>I found out these original bonsai trees
start at $10,000.</i>

770
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
- Seriously?
- See, that's why it is so important to me.

771
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:34,600
This one tree can set Mr. Miyagi up for life.
That's the least I could do for him.

772
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,240
It's a long way down there.

773
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,080
- You know what I think?
- What?

774
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:48,040
I think when the tide comes in,
the ocean fills up the bottom down there.

775
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,520
Yeah, Mr. Miyagi sure knows
how to pick 'em.

776
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,280
Yeah, no kidding.

777
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,400
How are we supposed to find
Mr. Miyagi's tiny little tree in all this?

778
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,160
He told me he put it halfway down
the steepest cliff...

779
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,680
...where it would catch
the first rays of the sun.

780
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,600
Good luck. We're never gonna find it.

781
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,200
- Wait! That must be it! I found it!
- Are you sure?

782
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,120
<i>God, it's beautiful.
It's like the one on the back of my gi.</i>

783
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,680
Come on, let me see.

784
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,440
You see that ridge, where the sun hits...

785
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,800
It's just like the one on the pot I made.

786
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,000
How are we going to get
all the way down there?

787
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:23,200
You leave that to me. I'll teach you.
Come on. We gotta go get the ropes.

788
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,600
- You sure you understand everything?
- Yeah, I got it.

789
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:32,480
I feed this through here
and I hold this back here and I pray to God.

790
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:37,960
Okay. Now, are you sure
you want to do this?

791
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,560
I wanna do this?

792
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,080
- I gotta do it. I'll be okay.
- You got it. You'll be fine.

793
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,000
Remember, the rope is your friend.
Everything will be great.

794
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,280
Friend? This rope's more than my friend.

795
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,600
I love this rope.
This rope and I are going steady.

796
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,280
Right, rope? Just you and me, rope.

797
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,960
Just lean. Okay, you got it. Don't worry.

798
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,600
Just sit back. Just lean back. You got it.

799
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,560
This is almost fun.

800
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,440
I'm coming, okay? Just keep going.

801
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,840
This isn't so hard.
You're a pretty good teacher.

802
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,080
Thanks.

803
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,720
Daniel! Look out! I got you, okay?

804
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,560
- I'm coming! Daniel, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

805
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,240
Hold on! Don't move, I'm coming.
Stay there.

806
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:22,640
Okay, I got you. I got you.
Put both hands on the rope.

807
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,640
Put your feet against the rocks
and push out. I got you.

808
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,960
Push out! There you go!
All right, I got you.

809
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:34,240
Okay, now guide your rope.
Slide your hands to the brake.

810
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,280
To the brake. Right here. All right?

811
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,280
You okay?
Listen, I'm so sorry about the rock.

812
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,320
- You sure you're okay?
- No, I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

813
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,040
God, it's a lot steeper
than it looks from up there, huh?

814
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:51,600
- You've done this kinda stuff before, right?
- Yeah, but not from this high up.

815
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:53,760
Great!

816
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,960
Maybe we should go back.
Do you want to?

817
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,200
No, I gotta keep going.
I don't have a choice.

818
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:02,160
Well, just be careful, okay?
Watch your footing, there you go.

819
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,720
All right. God, you scared me.

820
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,240
I scared you?

821
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,440
- You can get killed doing this.
- Just think positive.

822
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,440
- How are we going to get back up there?
- Don't worry about it.

823
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,040
You're right. I got enough to worry about.

824
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,680
- What?
- Where's the tree?

825
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,160
It's right there, between the two ropes.

826
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,800
Come on.

827
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,520
It's a beautiful tree.

828
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:43,200
Mr. Miyagi must have looked like
Spider-Man coming down here, huh?

829
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,680
Yeah, no kidding.

830
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,720
Now, remember how I told you to lock off.

831
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,000
Take the rope
and you put it around your butt.

832
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,320
And you tie it around your leg.
Okay, get it?

833
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,280
- There you go. I got it!
- There you go. You got it.

834
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,960
- All right.
- Now you can use both your hands.

835
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,200
All right.

836
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,360
So he really planted this here, huh?

837
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:10,000
What, this tree? He brought this
all the way back from Okinawa.

838
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,760
What if he tells you to put it back?

839
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,520
What if he does?

840
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,000
He's not going to tell me to put it back.
Believe me, I know this guy.

841
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,880
<i>That bonsai shop
was his dream come true.</i>

842
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,600
- He won't have me put it back.
- I don't think we should be doing this.

843
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,520
I saw his face when he lost his job.
Believe me, I know what I'm doing.

844
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,040
But what about the tree?
Isn't it going to die?

845
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:35,840
The tree will be fine. The most important
thing is to pack the roots well.

846
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,880
Believe me, he's taught me everything
about these trees.

847
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,840
- Do you want me to take this for you?
- No, I got it.

848
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,320
All I need is a bag to pack the roots in.

849
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,400
- Daniel! Help me up!
- Hang on!

850
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,200
Don't let go! Grab the rope!
Are you okay?

851
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,600
I got it!

852
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,720
Oh, my God! The tree's in the water!
I gotta get it!

853
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,640
It's gonna get washed out!

854
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,360
Move! Hurry up!

855
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,320
Get out of the way!

856
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,200
I gotta get it!
It's gonna get washed out!

857
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,960
The rope! Hurry!
Get the canteen, quick!

858
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,280
We gotta wash the roots off.
The salt water will kill them!

859
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,920
- Is it gonna be okay?
- Mr. Miyagi will know what to do.

860
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,840
- Just move it!
- I got the canteen. It's ready.

861
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,800
We gotta get out of here!
The tide's coming in!

862
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,880
Wash the roots off. Be careful.

863
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,920
All right, let me have it.

864
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,480
- It's soaked.
- You did good. Put it right in there.

865
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,040
Little fella,
I'll have you home in no time.

866
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,680
No big breaks. We're in good shape.

867
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,880
- I just should have tied off better.
- It's not your fault.

868
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:32,960
Look, it was my idea to...

869
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,000
The ropes.

870
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,160
LaRusso! How you doing?

871
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,760
Heads up, Danny-boy.

872
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,440
Here's something you forgot.

873
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,600
How'd they get here?

874
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,320
- Hey, this isn't a joke anymore.
- I know.

875
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,960
So let the ropes down.

876
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:52,240
First sign the application.

877
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,160
First sign the application.

878
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,960
Screw you, man!

879
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,960
See, I think you got it backwards,
buddy-boy.

880
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,240
I'm not the one who's screwed here.

881
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,440
Now I figure the tide's gonna come
in about 12 minutes.

882
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,960
Hope you brought a life raft.

883
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,480
How do we get out of here without a rope?

884
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,760
- Without a rope, we're dead.
- We're dead. Yeah, well, this guy's dead.

885
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:18,960
You're dead. You want me to sign it?
Fine, I'll sign it.

886
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,640
We'll get in the ring
and we'll see who's laughing then.

887
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,040
We'll see who's smiling.
You're gonna be dead meat.

888
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,440
I hate this guy.

889
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,680
Here. I signed it.

890
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,360
You want it? You work for it.
You pull us up!

891
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,920
All right! We'll send them down.

892
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,320
Let them go.

893
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,120
I never learn.

894
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,560
I should have just signed
the damn thing in the first place.

895
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,840
I should have signed it
and gotten it over with.

896
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,680
You didn't know this would happen.

897
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,680
With this guy, I should have known.

898
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:51,000
I should have known with that guy.

899
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,960
I should have just signed the damn thing.

900
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,600
We wouldn't be stuck down here.
The tree would be safe.

901
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:00,120
I'm just such a jackass.
Come on, get us out of here!

902
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,840
Come on, pull!

903
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,560
All right, I got you.

904
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,120
You're one heavy wimp, Daniel.

905
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,760
Come on, don't stop. Keep pulling!

906
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:33,080
- What are you doing?
- Pull us up.

907
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,200
Leave him there. Get the application.

908
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,920
No, you get the application
when I get up there.

909
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,080
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

910
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,800
All right, here. Just hold us.

911
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,560
- Go get it.
- Here, take it.

912
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,440
Check it out.

913
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,680
It's cool.

914
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,080
That's it.

915
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,680
Don't even think about backing out, man...

916
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,560
...because then I'll really be pissed.

917
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,160
And this, well,
this'll all seem like a happy memory...

918
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,120
...compared to what I'd do to you.

919
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,040
And what we'd all do to her.

920
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,600
Now you're talking.

921
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,520
- Hey!
- Come on! Pull us up!

922
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,040
What, Tarzan?

923
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,400
Pull us up!

924
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,120
- What will you give me?
- I gave you the application.

925
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,000
Yeah, the stakes just went up.

926
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,040
- Give me the tree.
- Daniel, don't!

927
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,840
- No!
- Shut up!

928
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,720
All right.

929
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,960
Just hold us. Don't let go.

930
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,480
Here. Now please be careful with it.

931
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,360
- Please, be careful.
- I will be.

932
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,640
- What are you gonna do with it?
- I'm gonna plant it down there!

933
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,640
- No!
- No, don't, please.

934
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,120
All right, enough. Give me it.

935
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,280
- You want it?
- Just don't throw it over.

936
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,200
Be careful with it, please.

937
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,520
Daniel...

938
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,840
...make a wish.

939
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,120
No!

940
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,720
Mr. Miyagi?

941
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,080
<i>Daniel-san.</i>

942
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,400
The trunk's split. See?

943
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,240
I put the roots in peat moss,
but they got salt water on them...

944
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,600
...and I washed it.

945
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,720
Will you be able to save it?
I didn't mean for this to happen.

946
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:23,800
I'm sorry.

947
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,080
I just figured maybe we could sell it...

948
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,680
...so we wouldn't have to close.

949
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,560
I didn't want it to be my fault
your dream didn't come true.

950
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,360
Whoever bought it would take good care.

951
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,920
Even better care than yourself.

952
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,280
- Tape. A wide one.
- That's so stupid.

953
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,280
How can someone take care of it
better than where you left it?

954
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:42,000
- I didn't mean for this to happen.
- Hold.

955
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:45,840
- I'm sorry. Please forgive me.
- Miyagi forgive you.

956
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,040
You do? I'm such an idiot.

957
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,320
- Is it gonna be okay?
- Depends.

958
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,760
If roots strong, tree survive.

959
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,880
<i>Where do you want these bonsai trees?</i>

960
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,920
Over there on rack, okay. Thank you.

961
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,920
- Trees?
- Peat moss.

962
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,520
Trees? What? What did you do?

963
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,480
Did you buy these?

964
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,160
With what?

965
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,280
Sell truck.

966
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,440
You sold the truck?

967
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,640
Well, why didn't you tell me
that's what you were going to do?

968
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,720
I wake up this morning, you gone.

969
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,560
Damn it!

970
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,360
Why am I so stupid?

971
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,320
<i>No worry, Daniel-san.</i>

972
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:29,000
Everything work out.
Everything okay now.

973
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,800
Mr. Miyagi,
I signed to fight in the tournament.

974
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,560
Why?

975
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,240
I don't know why.
Because I'm not you, that's why.

976
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,000
I don't always have the right answers.

977
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:47,240
We were at the bottom.
They pulled the ropes up.

978
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,600
I made a decision on the spot.

979
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,800
It was the wrong one.
What else was I supposed to do?

980
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,240
Understand.

981
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:54,920
You do?

982
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,600
Listen, Mr. Miyagi,
I gotta be honest with you.

983
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:01,520
I don't stand a chance against this guy
unless you train me.

984
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,600
Understand.

985
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:05,080
Well then, you'll train me, right?

986
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,960
<i>Daniel-san, Miyagi always train you.</i>

987
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,720
But for tournament, cannot.

988
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,160
Cannot?

989
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,240
Cannot? What?
What do you mean, cannot?

990
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,680
Mr. Miyagi, why not?

991
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,040
You know what the worst thing was:

992
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,960
When he told me he wouldn't train me
for the tournament.

993
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,080
- Then I knew I was dead.
- What a drag.

994
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,400
Great, let me get some water.
I'm dying of thirst.

995
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,640
- You can't swallow.
- I won't.

996
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,800
You can't keep stopping like this.
You gotta build up your wind.

997
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,960
So bonehead can knock more out of me?

998
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,240
You gotta have more confidence.

999
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:53,760
- Remember you are the champion.
- Yeah, I'd like to forget it.

1000
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,960
Jessica, this is...

1001
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,360
Hi, there.

1002
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,360
- Sorry, what's your name?
- Terry Silver.

1003
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,440
Terry Silver, this is Jessica Andrews.

1004
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,200
- You training for the Olympics?
- No, it's a tournament.

1005
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,520
The one you won last year?
What's it called?

1006
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,640
The All Valley.

1007
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,560
Right. Good for you.
A champion should defend his title.

1008
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,720
John Kreese told me you had a lot of heart.

1009
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,920
Listen, do you know how to front sweep?

1010
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,480
- Not really.
- Learn.

1011
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:22,200
Most tournament guys
are suckers for the front sweep.

1012
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,600
You can catch them every time.
Ask your Mr. Miyagi. He'll show you.

1013
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,360
I'm kind of training for this one myself.

1014
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,640
That's too bad.

1015
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,120
I got a good book on sweep techniques.
I'll drop it off for you sometime.

1016
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,320
Great.

1017
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,160
Nice to meet you, Jessica.
Take care of our champion.

1018
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,280
All right, I will. 'Bye.

1019
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,880
That was a nice offer about the book.
Come on, you ready?

1020
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,720
- Let's go. Yes.
- No, I'm pooped.

1021
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,720
- All right, here I come.
- Come on. You're gorgeous. Hurry.

1022
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,400
- Okay, I'm running.
- You gotta get some muscle.

1023
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:53,880
Oh, man.

1024
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,000
Get out of here! I signed it!

1025
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,600
- Why'd you call the cops?
- Why'd you steal the trees?

1026
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:06,960
You have no proof.

1027
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,520
Who left the application, the tooth fairy?

1028
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:11,800
It's your ass, man!

1029
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,720
There's nothing you've got
that I can't counter.

1030
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,560
- Your karate's a joke.
- Let him up, punk!

1031
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,880
- Who are you, his mother?
- Maybe.

1032
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,120
Get up! Get up!

1033
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:30,400
You see this? You see it?

1034
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,240
Get your hands off me!

1035
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,840
If I see you even on the same street
as this kid...

1036
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,960
...I won't be so charitable with your health.

1037
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,200
- Understand?
- Yes!

1038
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:45,200
Get the hell out of here.

1039
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,560
Who is that guy?

1040
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,160
- That's the lunatic who wants my title.
- Come on.

1041
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:52,520
- I was hoping you would kill him.
- That's not what karate's about.

1042
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,440
- It's for defence.
- I know, you're right.

1043
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:56,880
- Here's your book.
- I brought that for you.

1044
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,440
Right. Thanks.

1045
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,920
There's only so much
you can learn from a book.

1046
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,440
You're telling me.

1047
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,440
Come on, stand up.
Let me show you a couple of moves.

1048
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:09,120
Help you deal with punks like that.
Make a strong stance.

1049
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,560
Back leg up a little more.
Okay, now sweep me.

1050
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:16,560
- Well, what do you mean, like that?
- I'm not made of glass. Do it right.

1051
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,400
Better.

1052
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,280
Now a little higher
and at the end twist your hip.

1053
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,320
Keep your hand up.

1054
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:28,840
Are you okay?

1055
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,320
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.
- That's good.

1056
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,200
That's a strong move.

1057
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,760
Everyone needs a teacher, Daniel.

1058
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:39,200
<i>I'm opening the Cobra Kai dojo again.
It's time to set things straight.</i>

1059
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,200
Anytime you want to train,
I'll be there for you. No strings attached.

1060
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:47,840
Thanks. I appreciate that, but...
Listen, thanks for helping me out.

1061
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,280
It's my pleasure.
All right, I'll see you around.

1062
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,760
I'll see you.

1063
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,200
Thanks again.

1064
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,920
- Hi, Jessica.
- Hi, Daniel.

1065
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,360
Hey. Mr. Miyagi.

1066
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:15,520
Listen, I have a favour to ask of you.

1067
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:22,120
- Look, Jessica make. Beautiful. You like?
- I stayed up all night firing them.

1068
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:26,000
I saw one the other night. They're great.
Listen, I have a favour to ask of you.

1069
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,800
I just want to ask you,
do you know how to sweep?

1070
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,560
Of course.

1071
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,440
Would you mind showing me?
I'm not asking you to train me.

1072
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,440
I don't want you to train me. One thing.

1073
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,520
I'd be so appreciative.
All you have to give me is one thing.

1074
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:42,440
That's it. Please, you gotta do it. Be a pal.

1075
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,800
You wait here. I be right back.

1076
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,840
Where you going?

1077
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,920
Just wait here.

1078
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:53,000
This is great.
Mr. Miyagi will teach me front sweeps.

1079
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:56,800
I found out from this guy, tournament guys
are suckers for front sweeps.

1080
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,080
- Really?
- I mean, if I get that down, man, I'm...

1081
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:03,080
<i>Daniel-san, you hold like this.
First, left sweep...</i>

1082
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,720
It's no joke, all right?

1083
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,360
You don't want to show me,
you don't show me.

1084
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:10,080
Just don't make fun of me, all right?

1085
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:14,560
I'm sorry for asking.
Don't worry. It won't happen again.

1086
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,720
- Hey.
- Hi, that was great, man.

1087
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,520
- How you doing?
- Good.

1088
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:09,320
- Just trying to work the rust out.
- Listen, I gave your offer some thought.

1089
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,360
And?

1090
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:13,280
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to take you up on it.

1091
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,640
I mean,
you know, just on a short-term basis.

1092
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:18,520
Trouble, are you kidding?
lt'd be an honour.

1093
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:21,040
How does Mr. Miyagi feel about it?

1094
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,160
Well, Mr. Miyagi...

1095
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:29,080
...doesn't need to know about it, if...

1096
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,760
- But he knows you're competing?
- He knows that.

1097
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,600
He just doesn't approve.

1098
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:39,120
Everybody has a right to his opinion.

1099
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,000
- Look, I won't say anything.
- Thanks.

1100
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:44,080
So, when do you want to start?

1101
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:47,040
No, I mean, that's up to you.
Whenever it's...

1102
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,720
<i>I got a gi hanging in the closet.
I think it'll fit.</i>

1103
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,880
What do you say we go right now?

1104
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,040
Now?

1105
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:54,760
One more.

1106
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,480
Good. Catch your breath.
Come on over here.

1107
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,760
You're better than I thought.

1108
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,560
You're ready to move on, Mr. LaRusso.

1109
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,320
You're ready to move on.

1110
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,880
There are three things
that make a champion.

1111
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:13,200
The three "D"s:
Desire, devotion and discipline.

1112
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,040
The first two I can't give you.

1113
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:18,040
The last one I can,
but you have to be willing to receive it.

1114
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,880
Are you, Mr. LaRusso?

1115
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,720
Sure.

1116
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,160
The response you're looking for is,
"Yes, sir."

1117
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:28,480
- Right. Yes, sir. I'm sorry.
- That's okay. Stand up straight.

1118
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,960
Now, over the years I've developed
a system of intensive short-term training...

1119
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,960
...for situations just like this.

1120
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,200
It comes in two parts and has three rules.

1121
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,960
- I call it "Quick Silver."
- That's good.

1122
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,680
You like that, huh?

1123
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:44,920
Rule Number One:

1124
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,440
A man can't stand, he can't fight.

1125
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,680
Repeat it.

1126
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,880
A man can't stand, he can't fight.

1127
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,040
With conviction, Mr. LaRusso.

1128
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:57,960
- A man can't stand, he can't fight.
- Good. All right.

1129
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:02,560
Imagine these two-by-fours are legs.
Sweep them.

1130
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,360
What are you...

1131
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,520
That's too low.

1132
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,520
Any higher it'd be like hitting the knee.
Right?

1133
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,640
Did you come here
to teach or to be taught?

1134
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,600
We're not sweeping floors here. Harder.

1135
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:40,480
Come on, put your hip into it.
That's where the power is.

1136
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,440
That's it. Harder.

1137
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,120
Harder.

1138
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:54,360
<i>"Ow" is not an acceptable kiai in this dojo,
Mr. LaRusso.</i>

1139
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,960
Isn't this a little bit extreme, sir?
I mean, come on.

1140
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,040
Extreme situations
require extreme measures.

1141
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,480
Now, you come back tomorrow.
We'll start again.

1142
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,440
You did good for your first day.

1143
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:30,880
Thanks.

1144
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,880
I really appreciate all your help.

1145
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:42,000
- Thanks again.
- You're welcome.

1146
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,400
Who is it?

1147
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,600
Why don't you come in?

1148
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:30,160
Just catching up on some sit-ups here.

1149
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:33,320
You know, it's not easy
when you're training yourself.

1150
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,920
What happened foot?

1151
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:39,200
What foot?

1152
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,240
Look at that!

1153
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,440
I don't know.

1154
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:49,840
Maybe I banged it in my sleep.
I don't remember.

1155
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:53,600
- What's that?
- You soak foot.

1156
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,440
Be better tomorrow.

1157
01:11:55,520 --> 01:12:00,480
- You got a new foot in there for me?
- No. Next best thing. New foot powder.

1158
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:07,040
Smells like old foot powder.
What's in there?

1159
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:10,640
Better you don't know. Give me foot.

1160
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,320
- It's hot!
- Hot, hot...

1161
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:20,800
Good.

1162
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:26,600
Maybe tomorrow
you remember what happened foot?

1163
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,200
Then you tell Miyagi.

1164
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:30,560
Tomorrow? No.

1165
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:34,520
I have so many things to do tomorrow.
Tomorrow, I'm busy.

1166
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:40,360
Tomorrow is a bad day.
In the morning, I'm supposed to...

1167
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:44,120
In the afternoon, I'm meeting with
a buddy of mine I haven't seen since...

1168
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,200
...we got back, you know, from Okinawa.

1169
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,000
What am I doing?

1170
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,280
What am I doing?

1171
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:31,000
Hope confusion end soon.

1172
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:36,800
Miyagi heart empty without you.

1173
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:46,360
The bruise on your foot is gone.
That's good. You're a fast healer.

1174
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,000
All right, let's go.

1175
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:52,440
That's a nice move.
Mr. Miyagi teach you that?

1176
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,840
- No.
- I didn't think so.

1177
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:58,080
<i>- What was the last thing he taught you?
- We did kata.</i>

1178
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,880
<i>- Kata?
- Yeah.</i>

1179
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,280
<i>Kata is good for working up a sweat.
It won't win the tournament.</i>

1180
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,400
Come on over here. Hold the bag.

1181
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,440
Rule Number Two
of the "Quick Silver" method:

1182
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,040
A man can't breathe, he can't fight.

1183
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,480
Now, imagine this is the enemy.

1184
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,400
These are his ribs, behind them his lungs.

1185
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,040
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1186
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:23,760
Good. You try it.

1187
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,920
Wait a minute. Let's do it over here.

1188
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,240
- Where?
- Right here, his ribs.

1189
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:32,800
Lay into him.

1190
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,960
Why do I have to do this with this thing?

1191
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,360
Because it's part of the training.

1192
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:48,120
Because I'm teaching you
techniques you don't have.

1193
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:50,560
Techniques you need
to win the tournament.

1194
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:53,520
What, do you think you can rely
on that crane crap?

1195
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,920
I did pretty well with it last time.

1196
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:00,560
Wake up and smell the coffee.

1197
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,400
Last time you weren't fighting this.

1198
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,640
You don't get it, do you?

1199
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:14,400
If you want to lose because of a little pain,
I can't be a part of that.

1200
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:17,200
I make wimps into winners,
not the other way around.

1201
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,280
Christ, I'm wasting my time.

1202
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:49,840
Yeah?

1203
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,640
Damn it! Can you come back later?

1204
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,960
Why are you doing this to yourself?

1205
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,200
Doing what?

1206
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:01,160
What you doing.

1207
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,240
Because...

1208
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:08,280
...extreme situations
require extreme measures, okay?

1209
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,400
That not sound like you talking.

1210
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,880
It is me talking, all right?

1211
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,960
I'm sorry if you don't like it,
but I got problems...

1212
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:22,440
...and if you won't be part of the solution,
don't give me a hard time.

1213
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,080
Okay? You got it?

1214
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:58,280
<i>What are you wasting your time
with kata for?</i>

1215
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:01,000
Didn't I tell you
it's useless in a tournament?

1216
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:03,800
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir. You're right. I'm sorry.

1217
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,280
All right. Come over here.

1218
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:10,240
Let's get back to learning something
that can do some real damage.

1219
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,360
Rule Number Three:

1220
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:14,840
A man can't see, he can't fight.

1221
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,440
If you hit him square in the nose...

1222
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,920
...he'll be blinded by his tears
and choke on his own blood.

1223
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,640
Here's how it works.

1224
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:26,520
You wait until your man is attacking
and when he's close enough...

1225
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:30,320
But that would be face contact.
I'd be disqualified.

1226
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:33,360
- He ran into your fist, not your fault, right?
- Right.

1227
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:36,280
He can't continue. That means you win.

1228
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,920
- You like that?
- I like that.

1229
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,600
Good. Give it a shot.

1230
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,880
Let's try it over here on your friend.

1231
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,600
Reverse punch.

1232
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,480
Visualise.

1233
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,840
This isn't a bunch of sticks
and pipes anymore.

1234
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:59,800
This is a living fighting machine
that wants to detach...

1235
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:02,680
...your head from the rest of your body!

1236
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,640
It's blood. So what?

1237
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:13,960
Make believe it's his.
This guy wants to break you.

1238
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:18,320
Humiliate you. Stomp you into the ground.
What are you going to do about it?

1239
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:20,560
- Gonna nail him!
- Then do it.

1240
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,920
- Yes! You did it!
- I did it, man!

1241
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:28,760
You nailed him!

1242
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:32,680
- You're ready!
- I'm ready!

1243
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,240
- What new teacher?
- The guy who's been training me.

1244
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:40,200
You met him. We were jogging
and he pulled up in the car.

1245
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,000
I know who you are talking about.

1246
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,800
He's teaching me stuff
I thought I'd never be able to do.

1247
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:48,000
- That's what you said about Mr. Miyagi.
- But this guy's different.

1248
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,480
- How do you mean "different"?
- I'll show you sometime.

1249
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,440
- Come on, let's rock 'n' roll.
- All right, let's do it.

1250
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,120
What are you looking at?

1251
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,800
What are you doing
looking at other guys like that for?

1252
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,400
I don't play that.

1253
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:01,320
- I got some nerve?
- You got some nerve...

1254
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,040
What about you?

1255
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:05,720
- No, you get...
- Get out of my way, white boy!

1256
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,200
If I don't get something to drink,
I'm gonna die.

1257
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,280
Tell me. I could drink a horse.

1258
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:50,000
- Mr. Silver, what are you doing here?
- You told me you'd be here, remember?

1259
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,400
- Hold up, sexy lady.
- Who's your friend?

1260
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,600
- I've been watching you and you are hot.
- She's with me, man.

1261
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:57,520
- Says who?
- Says me.

1262
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,880
I'm taking her home.

1263
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:06,240
What are you doing?
What is wrong with you?

1264
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:07,680
What, are you nuts?

1265
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:10,640
Come on. We gotta get out of here!

1266
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:12,120
Up you go.

1267
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:15,240
- What happened?
- He broke my nose, man.

1268
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:17,280
Where's that guy with my money?

1269
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,640
Get out of the way!

1270
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,760
Man, that was beautiful.
You didn't even think.

1271
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,920
Something got in your way, bang!
Down it went!

1272
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,480
I gotta go back in there.

1273
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:30,320
- What are you saying?
- I gotta check that guy out.

1274
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:33,000
Technique and killer instinct.
You got it all now, kid.

1275
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,320
- No, I gotta get out of here.
- Where you going?

1276
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:38,720
What's wrong? You did the right thing.
You had no choice.

1277
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,040
Who is it?

1278
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,960
It's me, it's Daniel.

1279
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,040
What do you want?

1280
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:55,760
- Can I talk to you?
- I'm busy.

1281
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,000
Just give me a minute. Please.

1282
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,920
I want to apologise for tonight.
It shouldn't have happened.

1283
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,720
You should tell that to the guy
whose nose you broke.

1284
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,680
I am. I will.

1285
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,440
I just didn't want you leaving
thinking that was me.

1286
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,920
It wasn't you?

1287
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,520
Then who was it? Conan the Barbarian?

1288
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:20,600
I've been trying to be someone I'm not
and it's not working.

1289
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:23,440
I feel like I'm losing control of everything.

1290
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:26,880
The only thing I see you losing control of
is your temper.

1291
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:29,640
Well, and your friendship
and Mr. Miyagi's trust.

1292
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:31,800
I've lost everything.
I don't know what to do.

1293
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:34,200
I've wrecked everything with Mr. Miyagi.

1294
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:38,080
I know he's written me off.
And I can't blame him. I don't blame him.

1295
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:40,760
I don't know what the hell I'm going to do.

1296
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,600
Nobody's written you off.

1297
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:58,600
Just because I got upset
doesn't mean I'm not your friend anymore.

1298
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:02,880
Mr. Miyagi, he loves you.
He has faith in you. He told me that.

1299
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:06,800
Let's see how much faith he has
when he hears about what I did tonight.

1300
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:11,280
- I think he should hear it from you first.
- It's too late. I blew it. It's blown.

1301
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:14,000
You're gonna blow,
unless you do something about it now.

1302
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:18,840
I know, you're right. It's easy to say.
It's just, I don't know if I could face him.

1303
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,920
You'll do fine.

1304
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:29,040
You just gotta do it.

1305
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:34,440
Well, I don't know if I can.

1306
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,240
I'm gonna miss you.

1307
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,360
Send me a Christmas card, okay?

1308
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,040
You got a deal.

1309
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,400
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

1310
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,240
Thanks.

1311
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,120
Anytime.

1312
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:09,320
I just told the other nurse
that I don't know his name.

1313
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:12,000
I'm the guy who broke his nose.
I need to talk to him.

1314
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,880
I need to tell him I'm sorry
and that I want to pay for it.

1315
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,640
Please, let me speak with him.

1316
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:23,120
No, I can't wait until tomorrow, all right.
I gotta talk to him now, damn it!

1317
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:27,040
All right. I'm sorry, okay?
I don't mean to be rude, I'm...

1318
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:29,240
Hello, miss?

1319
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,560
Look at this.

1320
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:40,080
Look at my sweatshirt.
I got some poor guy's blood all over me.

1321
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,600
Everything you taught me,
I did the opposite.

1322
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:45,600
I couldn't have been worse.
I did everything wrong.

1323
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:48,920
I just feel like your tree.
You know, the one that I wrecked.

1324
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,640
I feel just like that.
I feel like I'm falling apart.

1325
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,080
Miyagi show you something.

1326
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:55,680
I feel like the whole world
is coming down on me.

1327
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,520
It's all my fault. I did it myself.

1328
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:01,960
Everything can heal. Just take time.

1329
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:03,360
Take patience.

1330
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:08,240
I'm sorry. When I started out
I never meant for it to end the way it did.

1331
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:11,760
Sometime when take trip,
better know where trip end.

1332
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:14,480
Otherwise better just stay home.

1333
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,240
It's budding.

1334
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,720
Look at that, it's gonna make it.

1335
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:26,040
Make it because have strong root.

1336
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,120
<i>Just like you, Daniel-san.</i>

1337
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:32,320
Inside you have strong root.

1338
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,840
No need nothing
except what inside you to grow.

1339
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,920
Understand?

1340
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:46,120
I do understand.

1341
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,680
You're right.

1342
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:55,760
I gotta go. I'll be right back.
I'll just be a little while.

1343
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:57,080
Where going?

1344
01:25:57,200 --> 01:26:00,840
You remember that guy, Terry Silver?
He's the one that's been training me.

1345
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:03,880
He meant well,
but I want to tell him it's over.

1346
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:08,720
- It not wait for tomorrow?
- I'll feel better if I get it over with now.

1347
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,440
You like Miyagi come help you?

1348
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:14,400
No, I did it myself.
I'll get out of it myself, all right?

1349
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:16,720
I'll be back in a little while.

1350
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:34,280
Hello.

1351
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,600
Mr. Silver?

1352
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:50,520
Hello?

1353
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:54,640
Hello?

1354
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,240
Mr. Silver?

1355
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,120
Hey.

1356
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:02,960
- Hi.
- Here you are.

1357
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:07,280
- Where'd you go?
- I had to go think about some things.

1358
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,000
- And...
- And?

1359
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:12,720
And I've...
Listen, I've decided not to defend my title.

1360
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:16,080
I really appreciate
everything you've done for me.

1361
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:18,480
I mean, you've been great. I just...

1362
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,040
You know, when I hit that guy,
that's just not me.

1363
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,920
I just wanted to come here
and tell you in person...

1364
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
...'cause I figured after everything,
I owed you at least that.

1365
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:30,120
You owe me a lot more than that,
Danny-boy.

1366
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,840
I'm sorry.
I thought the lessons were free, but...

1367
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,920
No. Nothing's for free.

1368
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,520
You are going to defend.

1369
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,920
You're getting in that ring.

1370
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,440
Excuse me, Mr. Silver...

1371
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:44,520
...you can't make me do something
I don't want to do.

1372
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:50,880
Danny.

1373
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:55,720
Since you met me, I've made you do things
you didn't want to do.

1374
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,360
What are you talking about?

1375
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,400
- What am I talking about?
- Yeah, what?

1376
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,800
Let's show him what I'm talking about.

1377
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:06,880
I'm what he's talking about, shithead.

1378
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:11,120
- We have a simple agenda here.
- You're crazy.

1379
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:14,760
Either you fight one fight
or fight for the rest of your life.

1380
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:16,720
- You're sick!
- What's it gonna be?

1381
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:20,480
I'm not gonna be there.
So just forget about it, all right?

1382
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:27,320
Let's show Mr. Kreese
how he's going to get his business back.

1383
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:29,640
- I won't fight.
- You don't have to.

1384
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:32,400
You can just stand there
and let him kick your ass.

1385
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:39,920
- Do the crane, Danny-boy!
- You're doing this to yourself, man.

1386
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:42,520
Yes!

1387
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:47,240
- You wanna see some more?
- I wanna see a lot more.

1388
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:48,840
Bring him back.

1389
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:50,880
You see his face?

1390
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,960
See the trail? I think he peed in his pants!

1391
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:10,560
Well, look who's here. The big war hero.

1392
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:15,320
What are you waiting for?

1393
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:24,120
Party time.

1394
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:30,080
We're old friends.

1395
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,240
Come on, little man.

1396
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,760
Let's see how good you really are.

1397
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,440
You think this is the end of it, old man?

1398
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:43,360
<i>I'm going to open Cobra Kai dojos
all over this valley.</i>

1399
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,720
Hell, I might even teach for free.

1400
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:48,240
From now on when people say
karate around here...

1401
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,480
...all they'll mean is Cobra Kai karate.

1402
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:53,840
John Kreese's karate.
You won't even be a memory.

1403
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,560
Yes, he will. You won't.

1404
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:01,680
Now will you train me?

1405
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:10,080
Now Miyagi train you.

1406
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:14,920
Come. Waste time here.

1407
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,040
We plant tree here.

1408
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:58,520
- You take tree.
- All set.

1409
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:00,600
- Careful.
- I got it.

1410
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:04,200
Happy to be home, old fella? Yeah, I bet.

1411
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:07,720
Let's get this crummy plastic bag off you.

1412
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,800
Put you back where you belong.

1413
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:12,520
There you go.

1414
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:14,720
Nice comfortable spot.

1415
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:17,960
<i>- That feel good?
- Good spot, Daniel-san.</i>

1416
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:22,400
I got just what you need.
A nice cool drink.

1417
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:27,520
Let some of your old roots soak that up.

1418
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:31,680
<i>Daniel-san, this bonsai have strong root.</i>

1419
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:33,760
Same you.

1420
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:37,200
This tree now choose how it grow.

1421
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:40,440
So must you choose how you grow.

1422
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,960
Miyagi have great faith in you.

1423
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,880
Understand?

1424
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:16,400
<i>Come on, Daniel-san.</i>

1425
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:37,800
See you around, old fella.

1426
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,040
<i>Point Barnes!</i>

1427
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:55,800
<i>The score is 2-0.</i>

1428
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:58,800
- Let's do it up, do it right!
- Ready? Begin!

1429
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:04,040
- Did you teach him that?
- No, that one is his.

1430
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:07,960
A warning for a kick to the groin.
Once more, costs you a point.

1431
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:10,680
Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

1432
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,120
<i>Three points for Barnes.</i>

1433
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,000
- Danny-boy's gonna get murdered up there.
- Winner!

1434
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:19,840
Face me. Bow.

1435
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:21,320
Shake hands.

1436
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:23,760
You're next, LaRusso. I own your ass.

1437
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:26,480
<i>While we wait for the challenger
to catch his breath...</i>

1438
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:28,760
T-shirts! Get your Cobra Kai T-shirts!

1439
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:32,920
<i>... I'd like to thank a new patron of ours
for the purchase and donation...</i>

1440
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,160
<i>... of the permanent home
of the All Valley Championships.</i>

1441
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:41,480
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the president
of Dyna-tox Industries, Mr. Terry Silver.</i>

1442
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:43,320
Yeah, Mr. Silver!

1443
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:47,840
<i>Thank you, John.</i>

1444
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:49,800
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

1445
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:54,600
<i>I've always lived my life by the rule:
"If you get, you give."</i>

1446
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:58,960
<i>For the last 20 years,
I've gotten from karate.</i>

1447
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:01,720
<i>I've gotten discipline...</i>

1448
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:04,720
<i>... health, self-confidence...</i>

1449
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,320
<i>... inner peace.</i>

1450
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:09,040
<i>Everything that makes me
what I am today.</i>

1451
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:12,760
<i>And today, it's time for me to give back.</i>

1452
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:19,200
<i>It's my pleasure to announce
my partnership with the greatest...</i>

1453
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:23,200
<i>... karate man I have ever known,
Sensei John Kreese.</i>

1454
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:25,560
Yeah, Mr. Kreese.

1455
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:35,040
<i>Together, we are about to open
a chain of Cobra Kai dojos...</i>

1456
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:40,080
<i>... where young people can come
and learn the same values I've learned:</i>

1457
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:42,840
<i>Honesty...</i>

1458
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:45,320
<i>... compassion...</i>

1459
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:47,640
<i>... and fair play.</i>

1460
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:51,920
<i>Thank you all for coming.
Enjoy the final match.</i>

1461
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,120
<i>Thank you, Mr. Silver.</i>

1462
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:00,440
<i>And thank you again
for your most generous contribution.</i>

1463
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,160
Remember the game plan.

1464
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:04,600
First you win a point,
then you lose a point.

1465
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:08,280
Keep the score 0-0.
Pulverise him for the full three minutes.

1466
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:11,200
Then in sudden death,
you get the point, we win.

1467
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:13,440
I want him to experience pain.

1468
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:16,120
- First he suffers.
- Then he suffers some more.

1469
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:20,600
<i>Representing the Cobra Kai,
the challenger, Mike Barnes.</i>

1470
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:27,600
<i>And in this corner,
someone who needs no introduction...</i>

1471
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:30,960
<i>... the defending champion
from the Miyagi dojo...</i>

1472
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:33,080
<i>... Daniel LaRusso.</i>

1473
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:51,040
<i>This match will have
a three-minute time limit.</i>

1474
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:55,360
<i>The first fighter to score three points
will be designated this year's...</i>

1475
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:57,880
<i>... All Valley Under-18 Champion.</i>

1476
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:00,480
<i>- Fighters to your marks!
- Go out there and get him.</i>

1477
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,200
Flatten him out, Mike. Fight him!

1478
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:07,480
<i>Remember, folks, the new rule this year
states that if there is no winner...</i>

1479
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:11,600
<i>... at the end of three minutes
the championship match will go...</i>

1480
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:13,800
<i>... into sudden-death overtime.</i>

1481
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:16,120
When it's over,
his mother won't recognise him.

1482
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:17,280
You both know the rules.

1483
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:20,960
Light contact is allowed to the body,
and I do mean light, Mr. Barnes.

1484
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:23,000
No face contact is allowed.

1485
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:26,200
Any violation of the rules
will result in a penalty point.

1486
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:28,000
On your lines.

1487
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:29,720
Come on, Daniel!

1488
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:34,400
Face this way, bow. Face each other, bow.

1489
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:36,160
I said bow.

1490
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:39,680
Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

1491
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:46,800
Break, break! Let's go.
Out of the ring. No point.

1492
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:48,040
Begin!

1493
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,320
<i>Point, Barnes.</i>

1494
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:55,360
<i>Score: 1-0.</i>

1495
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,000
Look over at the slope.

1496
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:58,560
Is that perfect?

1497
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:02,360
One point Barnes for the punch.
Fighting positions.

1498
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:03,800
Begin!

1499
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:11,560
Danny-boy, how are the family jewels?

1500
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,720
Get off the mat! Now! Get off the mat!

1501
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:17,160
Do that again, Barnes,
and you're disqualified.

1502
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:21,520
<i>That illegal groin kick
will cost Barnes his previous point.</i>

1503
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:24,600
<i>Score is now 0-0.</i>

1504
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:27,040
Kick to the groin. Penalty point.

1505
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:29,560
- Score is 0-0.
- You're dirty, Barnes.

1506
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:33,520
- He'll get you 'cause you're dirty.
- Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

1507
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:43,400
That's the one, Mike.

1508
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:46,360
<i>Barnes scores the point. Reverse punch.</i>

1509
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:47,800
Go, Daniel!

1510
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:50,160
Come on, Daniel.

1511
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:52,520
Let's go, LaRusso.

1512
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:55,400
Point Barnes.

1513
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,480
Score is 1-0. Ready?

1514
01:39:57,560 --> 01:39:59,600
Come on, Mike, you got him.

1515
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,080
Begin!

1516
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:04,440
Break, break!

1517
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:06,320
On your line!

1518
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:10,160
That's it, Barnes.
One more violation and you're disqualified.

1519
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:13,240
<i>That illegal punch
will cost Barnes one point.</i>

1520
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:15,600
<i>The score is again 0-0.</i>

1521
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:17,600
You all right, LaRusso?

1522
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:21,000
Intentional face contact, penalty point.

1523
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:23,200
- Perfect.
- Score is 0-0.

1524
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:25,360
Fighting positions.

1525
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,200
Ready? Begin!

1526
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:33,200
Now the real pain begins, Danny-boy.

1527
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:36,160
On your lines.

1528
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:39,520
That's a warning
for running out of the ring.

1529
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:40,880
Come on, Barnes!

1530
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,560
Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

1531
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:51,880
Break! Break!

1532
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:53,480
On your line.

1533
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:54,920
He'll get up.

1534
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:56,840
He's too dumb not to.

1535
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:00,680
LaRusso, on your line.

1536
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:03,200
Get up, you pansy-ass!

1537
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:08,240
<i>- No point for kick to the back.
- No point scored.</i>

1538
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:12,400
- This is beautiful. It's beautiful.
- Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

1539
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:16,640
Break!

1540
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:20,520
What's the matter, you can't breathe?

1541
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:23,240
- On your line.
- I love it when he pounds him!

1542
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:27,160
- On your line.
- This is more fun than I thought.

1543
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:29,800
<i>No clean technique on that exchange.</i>

1544
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:31,600
<i>No point scored.</i>

1545
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:34,480
<i>The score remains 0-0.</i>

1546
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:37,040
<i>Ten seconds left in the match.</i>

1547
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:38,960
- Let's go, Danny.
- Fighting positions.

1548
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:41,640
- You gotta turn it around.
- Ready? Begin!

1549
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:44,040
Time!

1550
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:46,000
Break!

1551
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:49,040
<i>There will be a one-minute rest period.</i>

1552
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:51,840
<i>Then the match will continue
with sudden death.</i>

1553
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:55,160
<i>- Daniel-san!
- Mr. Miyagi, it's over.</i>

1554
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:56,880
- No!
- It's over, forget it.

1555
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:58,640
- No!
- I'm afraid. Let's go.

1556
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:00,360
- I want to go home.
- Can't! You must not!

1557
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:02,120
Is okay to lose to opponent.

1558
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:05,440
- Must not lose to fear!
- Yeah, well, I'm afraid!

1559
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:09,000
I'm afraid of him, all right?
What do you want me to do?

1560
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,760
You stay focused.

1561
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:16,240
<i>Daniel-san,
your best karate is still inside you.</i>

1562
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:18,360
Now time let out!

1563
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:22,840
<i>That's the end of the rest period.</i>

1564
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:25,640
- Fighters on your lines.
- Come on, get up!

1565
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:28,160
Get on that line!
Get on that line, LaRusso!

1566
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:30,640
You're worthless!
Your slope teacher's nothing!

1567
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:33,320
Get up, man!
You're no champion. Get up!

1568
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:35,800
You suck, LaRusso! You suck, man!

1569
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:38,840
And your teacher's karate is shit.
You hear me? He's shit!

1570
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:40,400
You're done, LaRusso.

1571
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:43,160
Your karate is a joke.
And your teacher's worth shit.

1572
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:48,600
He's nothing! And you're nothing!
I own you! I own you, LaRusso!

1573
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:51,800
Where's your little Jap teacher now?
He's a phoney, man.

1574
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:53,720
He's a fake
and he didn't teach you nothing.

1575
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:55,200
Your karate's shit. You hear me?
Get up!

1576
01:42:57,400 --> 01:43:00,280
Come on, Mike!
This is what we've been waiting for!

1577
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:07,320
Fighting positions.

1578
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:08,760
Ready?

1579
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:11,000
Begin!

1580
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:13,440
Mike! Take him out!

1581
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:19,720
Hit him!

1582
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:25,280
Get the point! Get the point!

1583
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:28,800
Hit him, Mike! He's hallucinating.

1584
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,280
Winner!

1585
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:43,280
<i>The winner and the first to ever win
two years in a row...</i>

1586
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:47,160
<i>... the grand champion, Daniel LaRusso. </i>

1587
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:51,880
Mr. Miyagi, forget about it!

1588
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:13,240
We did it! We did it!

1589
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:46,840
