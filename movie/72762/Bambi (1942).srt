Yes, sir,
it isn't every day a prince is born.

21
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,315
You're to be congratulated.

22
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,631
- Yes, congratulations.
- Congratulations.

23
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,631
Thank you very much.

24
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,189
Come on. Wake up.
We have company.

25
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,437
Hello. Hello, there.

26
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,478
- Hello, little prince.
- Hello. Hello, there.

27
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,596
Hello, little prince.

28
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,951
Look. He's trying to get up.

29
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,030
Kinda wobbly, isn't he?

30
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,031
Thumper.

31
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,031
Well, he is.

32
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,512
Aren't you?

33
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,837
Looks to me like
he's getting kind of sleepy.

34
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,230
l think it's time we all left.

35
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,958
Come on.

36
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,359
Thumper. Come on.

37
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,236
Whatcha gonna call him?

38
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,958
Well, l think l'll call him Bambi.

39
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,672
Yep, l guess that'll do all right.

40
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,471
My little Bambi.

41
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,556
Walking already.
Well, what do you know.

42
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,873
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mrs Quail.

43
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,076
And where's the young prince this...

44
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,396
- Good morning, Bambi.
- Good morning, young prince.

45
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,391
Goodbye.

46
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,191
Good morning, young prince.

47
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,397
Good morning, young prince.

48
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,196
Good morning.

49
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,191
Nice sunny day.

50
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,870
- What's the matter?
- What happened?

51
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,554
Did the young prince fall down?

52
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,871
- ls he hurt?
- No, he's all right.

53
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,433
He doesn't walk very good, does he?

54
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,317
Thumper.

55
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,031
Yes, Mama?

56
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,877
What did your father tell you
this morning?

57
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,392
lf you can't say something nice,

58
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,552
don't say nothing at all.

59
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,709
Come on, Bambi, get up. Try again.

60
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,360
Come on, get up. Get up.

61
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,591
- Get up.
- Try again.

62
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,479
l'm thumping.
That's why they call me Thumper.

63
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,231
Thumper!

64
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,158
Come on. You can do it.

65
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,958
Hop over it. Like this.

66
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,111
Hop over it.

67
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,311
Like this.

68
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,675
You didn't hop far enough.

69
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,108
That's it. Now the other one.

70
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,237
Gee whiz, what happened that time?

71
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,551
Those are birds.

72
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,676
Look, he's trying to talk.

73
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,951
He's trying to say ''bird''.

74
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,111
Say ''bird''.

75
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,318
Bird.

76
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,437
Bird.

77
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,875
Come on, say ''bird'', say ''bird''.

78
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,793
Say ''bird''. Say ''bird''.
Come on, say ''bird''.

79
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,791
Say ''bird''.

80
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,239
Bird.

81
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,198
He talked. He talked, Mama.

82
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,635
The young prince said ''bird''.

83
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,473
Bird, bird, bird...

84
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,434
Bird.

85
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,556
No, that's not a bird.

86
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,835
That's a butterfly.

87
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,911
Butterfly?

88
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,274
Butter...

89
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,352
Butterfly.

90
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,829
No, that's a flower.

91
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,515
- Flower?
- lt's pretty.

92
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,556
Pretty.

93
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,072
Flower.

94
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,593
Me?

95
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,235
That's not a flower.

96
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,880
- He's a little...
- That's all right.

97
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,556
He can call me a flower
if he wants to.

98
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,313
l don't mind.

99
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,235
Pretty. Pretty flower.

100
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,993
Gosh.

101
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,276
l think l better go home now.

Mother, what we going to do today?

135
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,468
l'm going to take you to the meadow.

136
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,038
Meadow? What's the meadow?

137
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,873
lt's a very wonderful place.

138
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,713
Then why haven't we been there before?

139
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,268
You weren't big enough.

140
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,954
- Mother, you know what?
- What?

141
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,713
We're not the only deer in the forest.

142
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,997
- Where did you hear that?
- Thumper told me.

143
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,275
Well, he's right.

144
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,920
There are many deer
in the forest besides us.

145
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,639
Then why don't l ever see them?

146
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,393
- You will, sometime.
- On the meadow?

147
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,118
Perhaps.

148
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,156
Hush now.

149
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,231
We're almost there.

150
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,311
- The meadow.
- Wait.

151
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,876
Bambi, wait.

152
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,159
You must never rush out on the meadow.

153
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,151
There might be danger.

154
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,236
Out there, we're unprotected.

155
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,709
The meadow is wide and open,

156
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,473
and there are no trees or bushes
to hide us.

157
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,790
So we have to be very careful.

158
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,672
Wait here.

159
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,674
l'll go out first. And if the meadow
is safe, l'll call you.

160
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,798
Come on, Bambi. lt's all right.

161
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,951
Come on.

162
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,631
Good morning, Prince Bambi.

163
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,029
Good morning, young prince.

164
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,759
Hello. What ya eatin'?

165
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,957
- Clover.
- lt's awfully good.

166
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,951
lt's delicious.

167
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,395
Why don't you try some?

168
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,071
No, not that green stuff.

169
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,916
Just eat the blossoms.

170
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,911
That's the good stuff.

171
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,479
Thumper.

172
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,828
- Yes, Mama?
- What did your father tell you?

173
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,719
About what?

174
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,679
About eating the blossoms
and leaving the greens?

175
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,637
Oh, that one.

176
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,269
Eating greens is a special treat.

177
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,319
lt makes long ears
and great big feet.

178
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,394
But it sure is awful stuff to eat.

179
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,398
l made that last part up myself.

180
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,831
Watch out.

181
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,955
That's little Faline.

182
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,793
He's kind of bashful, isn't he, Mama?

183
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,509
Well, maybe he wouldn't be
if you'd say hello.

184
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,517
Hello, Bambi.

185
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,000
l said hello.

186
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,275
Well, aren't you going to answer her?

187
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,390
You're not afraid, are you?

188
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,631
Well, then, go ahead.

189
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,671
Go on, say hello.

190
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,395
Hello.

191
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,151
You.

192
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,075
He stopped and looked at me.

193
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,355
Yes, l know.

194
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,668
Why was everyone still
when he came on the meadow?

195
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,830
Everyone respects him.

196
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:32,552
For of all the deer in the forest,
not one has lived half so long.

197
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,149
He's very brave and very wise.

198
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,314
That's why he's known as
the Great Prince of the Forest.

199
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,153
Faline.

200
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,633
Bambi.

201
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,959
Mother.

202
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,279
Bambi.

203
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,192
Mother.

204
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,831
Come on out, Bambi.

205
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,713
Come on.

206
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,231
lt's safe now.

207
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,073
We don't have to hide any longer.

208
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,910
What happened, Mother?
Why did we all run?

209
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,798
Man was in the forest.

210
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,595
Mother, look.
What's all that white stuff?

211
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,109
Why, it's snow.

212
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,668
- Snow?
- Yes.

213
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,671
Winter has come.

214
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,996
Hiya, Bambi.

215
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,755
Watch what l can do.

216
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,399
Come on. lt's all right.

217
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,833
Look.

218
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,551
The water's stiff.

219
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,639
Some fun, huh, Bambi?

220
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,033
Come on, get up. Like this.

221
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,679
Kinda wobbly, aren't you?

222
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,470
Got to watch both ends
at the same time.

223
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,990
Guess you better unwind it.

224
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,359
Wake up. Wake up, Flower.

225
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,633
ls it spring yet?

226
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,714
No. Winter's just started.

227
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,034
What you doing? Hibernating?

228
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,835
What do you want to do that for?

229
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,035
All us flowers sleep in the winter.

230
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,553
Well, good night.

231
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,116
Winter sure is long, isn't it?

232
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,111
lt seems long.

233
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,274
But it won't last forever.

234
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,596
l'm awful hungry, Mother.

235
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,910
Yes, l know.

236
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,916
Bambi, come here.

237
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,070
Look.

238
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,549
New spring grass.

239
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,758
Bambi. Quick.

240
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,070
The thicket.

241
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,839
Faster. Faster, Bambi.

242
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,276
Don't look back. Keep running.

243
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,396
Keep running.

244
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,911
We made it.

245
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,911
We made it, Mother.

246
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,034
We...

247
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,711
Mother.

248
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,434
Mother, where are you?

249
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,033
Your mother can't be with you anymore.

250
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,716
Come.

251
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,391
My son.

252
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,194
<i>Let's sing a gay little spring song</i>

253
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,633
<i>This is the season to sing</i>

254
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,349
<i>So I'd like to suggest
That we all do our best</i>

255
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,318
<i>And warble a song about spring</i>

256
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,550
<i>Spring, spring, spring</i>

257
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,108
<i>Let's get together and sing</i>

258
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,114
<i>Let's sing a gay little spring song</i>

259
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,753
<i>Just like bird on the wing</i>

260
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,196
<i>Things always seem right
When you're cheerful and bright</i>

261
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,874
<i>So let's get together and sing</i>

262
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,394
<i>Sing, sing, sing</i>

263
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,358
<i>Let's sing a song about spring</i>

264
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,989
<i>Let's twitter and tweet
Like the birdies in May</i>

265
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,277
<i>Get into the mood
And be merry today</i>

266
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,636
<i>Forget all your troubles
And warble away...</i>

267
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,631
Wait.

268
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,631
What now?

269
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,950
Hey.

270
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,398
Stop that racket.

271
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,959
Scat.

272
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,234
<i>Let's sing a song about spring</i>

273
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,911
l'll fix 'em.

274
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,077
There. l guess that'll teach 'em.

275
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,988
Oh, what's the use?

276
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,032
<i>This is the season to sing...</i>

277
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,713
Same thing every spring.

278
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,035
Love's sweet song.

279
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,188
Pain in the pin feathers, l call it.

280
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,711
Stop it.

281
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,549
Get out of here. All of you.

282
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,670
And you, too.

283
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,799
Hello, Friend Owl.
Don't you remember me?

284
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,030
Why, it's the young prince.

285
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,712
Bambi!

286
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,630
My, my, how you've changed.

287
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,712
Turn round there.
Let me look at you.

288
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,759
l see you've traded in your spots
for a pair of antlers.

289
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,508
You know, just the other day
l was talking to myself about you.

290
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,353
And we were wondering
what had become of you.

291
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,351
Hello, Bambi.

292
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,556
Remember me?

293
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,269
Thumper.

294
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,753
Right.

295
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,071
Hi, fellas.

296
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,718
Flower.

297
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,192
Yeah.

298
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,073
Well, what's the matter with them?

299
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,435
Why are they acting that way?

300
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,070
Why, don't you know?

301
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,392
They're ''twitterpated''.

302
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,113
Twitterpated?

303
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,790
Yes. Nearly everybody gets twitterpated
in the spring time.

304
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,991
For example,

305
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,155
you're walking along,
minding your own business,

306
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,153
you're looking neither to the left
nor to the right,

307
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,151
when all of a sudden

308
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,994
you run smack into a pretty face.

309
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,629
You begin to get weak in the knees.

310
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,711
Your head's in a whirl.

311
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,918
And then you feel light as a feather.

312
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,070
And before you know it,

313
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,754
you're walking on air.

314
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,591
And then you know what?

315
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,069
You're knocked for a loop.

316
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,913
And you completely lose your head.

317
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,157
Gosh, that's awful.

318
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,151
- Gee whiz.
- Terrible.

319
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,071
And that ain't all.

320
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,913
lt can happen to anybody.

321
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,240
So you'd better be careful.

322
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,389
lt could happen to you, and you, and...

323
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,193
Yes, it could even happen to you.

324
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,194
Well, it's not going to happen to me.

325
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,953
- Me neither.
- Me neither.

326
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,629
Twitterpated.

327
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,911
Hello, Bambi.

328
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,671
Don't you remember me?

329
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,231
l'm Faline.

330
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,399
Bambi.

331
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,999
<i>I bring you a song</i>

332
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,673
<i>And I sing as I go</i>

333
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,752
<i>For I want you to know</i>

334
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:44,197
<i>That I'm looking for romance</i>

335
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,749
<i>I bring you a song</i>

336
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:52,435
<i>In the hope that you'll see</i>

337
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,239
<i>When you're looking at me</i>

338
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,471
<i>That I'm looking for love</i>

339
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,518
<i>I'm seeking that glow</i>

340
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,239
<i>Only found when you're young
and it's May</i>

341
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,198
<i>Only found on that wonderful day</i>

342
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,191
<i>When all longing is through</i>

343
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,392
<i>I'm seeking that glow</i>

344
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,517
<i>Only found when a thrill is complete</i>

345
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,717
<i>Only found when two hearts gently beat</i>

346
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:29,273
<i>To the strains of a waltz
That's both tender and new</i>

347
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,636
<i>I bring you a song</i>

348
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,429
<i>For I'm seeking romance</i>

349
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,193
<i>You're by my side
There's a moon up above</i>

350
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,158
<i>It shines with a light
That's so mellow and bright</i>

351
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:47,758
<i>It's easy to see
That tonight we shall fall in love</i>

352
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:01,199
<i>I bring you a song</i>

353
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,272
<i>For I'm seeking romance</i>

354
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,759
<i>And you</i>

355
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,913
lt is Man.

356
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,911
He is here again.

357
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,314
There are many this time.

358
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,910
We must go deep into the forest.

359
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,911
Hurry. Follow me.

360
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,519
Faline.

361
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,391
Bambi, where are you?

362
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,319
Faline.

363
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,473
Listen.

364
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,437
- He's coming.
- Hush.

365
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,351
Be quiet.

366
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:02,273
- He's coming closer.
- Be calm. Don't get excited.

367
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:06,232
- We better fly.
- No. No, don't fly.

368
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,356
Whatever you do, don't fly.

369
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,830
He's almost here.
l can't stand it any longer.

370
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,309
Bambi.

371
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:44,995
Faline.

372
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,958
Quick, Faline. Jump.

373
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,471
Get up, Bambi.

374
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,391
Get up.

375
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,431
You must get up.

376
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,637
Get up.

377
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,351
Get up.

378
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,839
Now, come with me.

379
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:01,954
Bambi.

380
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,995
Wake up. Wake up, Friend Owl.

381
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,275
Wake up, Friend Owl.

382
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,397
What now?

383
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,394
Hey, what's going on around here?

384
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:55,038
- lt's happened.
- Happened?

385
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:57,031
Yes. ln the thicket.

386
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,997
Hurry up, Bambi.

387
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:02,311
Yes, Papa. l'm coming.

388
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:33,390
Oh. Well.

389
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,713
Look.

390
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,359
Two of them.

391
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:55,997
Well, l don't believe l've ever seen
a more likely looking pair of fawns.

392
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:59,038
Prince Bambi ought to be mighty proud.

393
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:10,595
<i>Love is a song that never ends</i>

394
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:18,475
<i>One simple theme repeating</i>

395
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,036
<i>Like the voice</i>

396
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:28,990
<i>Of a heavenly choir</i>

397
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:33,039
<i>Love's sweet music</i>

398
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:36,908
<i>Flows on</i>
