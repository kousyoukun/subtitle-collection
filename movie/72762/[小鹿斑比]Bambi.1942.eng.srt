00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,281
<i>Love is a song that never ends</i>

2
00:00:18,364 --> 00:00:23,745
<i>Life may be swift and fleeting</i>

3
00:00:23,828 --> 00:00:29,417
<i>Hope may die
Yet love's beautiful music</i>

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,131
<i>Comes each day like the dawn</i>

5
00:00:35,214 --> 00:00:40,845
<i>Love is a song that never ends</i>

6
00:00:40,928 --> 00:00:46,559
<i>One simple theme repeating</i>

7
00:00:46,642 --> 00:00:52,356
<i>Like the voice of a heavenly choir</i>

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:59,322
<i>Love's sweet music flows on</i>

9
00:01:06,245 --> 00:01:11,834
<i>Like the voice of a heavenly choir</i>

10
00:01:12,668 --> 00:01:18,758
<i>Love's sweet music flows on</i>

11
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,637
Wake up.

12
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,140
- What now?
- Wake up, Friend Owl.

13
00:04:55,224 --> 00:04:57,226
What's going on around here?

14
00:04:57,309 --> 00:04:59,520
- Wake up.
- It's happened.

15
00:04:59,645 --> 00:05:01,605
The new prince is born.

16
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:05,150
- We're going to see him.
- Come on. You better hurry up.

17
00:05:18,205 --> 00:05:20,207
Well, look.

18
00:05:22,126 --> 00:05:25,045
- Well.
- Isn't he cute?

19
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:32,469
Well, this is quite an occasion.

20
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,391
Yes, sir,
it isn't every day a prince is born.

21
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:41,228
You're to be congratulated.

22
00:05:41,312 --> 00:05:44,690
- Yes, congratulations.
- Congratulations.

23
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:46,775
Thank you very much.

24
00:05:47,818 --> 00:05:51,530
Come on. Wake up.
We have company.

25
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,079
Hello. Hello, there.

26
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:02,249
- Hello, little prince.
- Hello. Hello, there.

27
00:06:02,374 --> 00:06:04,460
Hello, little prince.

28
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:25,689
Look. He's trying to get up.

29
00:06:48,545 --> 00:06:50,798
Kinda wobbly, isn't he?

30
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:52,883
Thumper.

31
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:56,011
Well, he is.

32
00:06:57,971 --> 00:06:59,598
Aren't you?

33
00:07:07,147 --> 00:07:10,400
Looks to me like
he's getting kind of sleepy.

34
00:07:13,695 --> 00:07:16,031
I think it's time we all left.

35
00:07:16,114 --> 00:07:17,825
Come on.

36
00:07:35,217 --> 00:07:38,053
Thumper. Come on.

37
00:07:41,014 --> 00:07:43,141
Whatcha gonna call him?

38
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:48,063
Well, I think I'll call him Bambi.

39
00:07:51,942 --> 00:07:55,070
Yep, I guess that'll do all right.

40
00:07:58,073 --> 00:08:00,033
My little Bambi.

41
00:08:30,105 --> 00:08:33,483
Walking already.
Well, what do you know.

42
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,627
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mrs Quail.

43
00:08:52,711 --> 00:08:54,921
And where's the young prince this...

44
00:08:58,091 --> 00:09:01,511
- Good morning, Bambi.
- Good morning, young prince.

45
00:09:04,723 --> 00:09:06,683
Goodbye.

46
00:09:09,728 --> 00:09:11,730
Good morning, young prince.

47
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,280
Good morning, young prince.

48
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:36,755
Good morning.

49
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:39,883
Nice sunny day.

50
00:09:51,812 --> 00:09:54,147
- What's the matter?
- What happened?

51
00:09:54,231 --> 00:09:56,900
Did the young prince fall down?

52
00:09:57,025 --> 00:10:00,403
- Is he hurt?
- No, he's all right.

53
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,116
He doesn't walk very good, does he?

54
00:10:05,242 --> 00:10:07,118
Thumper.

55
00:10:07,953 --> 00:10:09,955
Yes, Mama?

56
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:13,959
What did your father tell you
this morning?

57
00:10:16,586 --> 00:10:19,673
If you can't say something nice,

58
00:10:23,093 --> 00:10:26,096
don't say nothing at all.

59
00:10:27,806 --> 00:10:31,518
Come on, Bambi, get up. Try again.

60
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:34,271
Come on, get up. Get up.

61
00:10:34,604 --> 00:10:36,565
- Get up.
- Try again.

62
00:11:07,846 --> 00:11:11,933
I'm thumping.
That's why they call me Thumper.

63
00:11:14,894 --> 00:11:16,896
Thumper!

64
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:37,667
Come on. You can do it.

65
00:11:38,543 --> 00:11:41,629
Hop over it. Like this.

66
00:11:42,922 --> 00:11:44,924
Hop over it.

67
00:11:48,345 --> 00:11:50,347
Like this.

68
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:05,320
You didn't hop far enough.

69
00:12:08,406 --> 00:12:10,992
That's it. Now the other one.

70
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:24,672
Gee whiz, what happened that time?

71
00:12:42,816 --> 00:12:44,776
Those are birds.

72
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:52,242
Look, he's trying to talk.

73
00:12:54,702 --> 00:12:56,704
He's trying to say "bird".

74
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,042
Say "bird".

75
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:06,464
Bird.

76
00:13:10,969 --> 00:13:12,846
Bird.

77
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:15,390
Come on, say "bird", say "bird".

78
00:13:15,473 --> 00:13:18,434
Say "bird". Say "bird".
Come on, say "bird".

79
00:13:18,518 --> 00:13:20,520
Say "bird".

80
00:13:22,647 --> 00:13:24,107
Bird.

81
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:29,279
He talked. He talked, Mama.

82
00:13:29,362 --> 00:13:31,823
The young prince said "bird".

83
00:13:31,906 --> 00:13:34,742
Bird, bird, bird...

84
00:13:54,262 --> 00:13:55,555
Bird.

85
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,765
No, that's not a bird.

86
00:13:57,891 --> 00:14:00,184
That's a butterfly.

87
00:14:00,268 --> 00:14:02,353
Butterfly?

88
00:14:02,437 --> 00:14:03,771
Butter...

89
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:10,111
Butterfly.

90
00:14:10,194 --> 00:14:12,697
No, that's a flower.

91
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,492
- Flower?
- It's pretty.

92
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:23,833
Pretty.

93
00:14:30,923 --> 00:14:32,759
Flower.

94
00:14:32,842 --> 00:14:34,302
Me?

95
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:45,438
That's not a flower.

96
00:14:45,521 --> 00:14:48,191
- He's a little...
- That's all right.

97
00:14:48,274 --> 00:14:53,029
He can call me a flower
if he wants to.

98
00:14:57,325 --> 00:15:00,119
I don't mind.

99
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:06,292
Pretty. Pretty flower.

100
00:15:12,924 --> 00:15:14,384
Gosh.

101
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:29,273
I think I better go home now.

102
00:16:25,538 --> 00:16:28,207

134
00:19:54,205 --> 00:19:56,874
Mother, what we going to do today?

135
00:19:56,957 --> 00:19:59,501
I'm going to take you to the meadow.

136
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:03,255
Meadow? What's the meadow?

137
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:06,216
It's a very wonderful place.

138
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,178
Then why haven't we been there before?

139
00:20:09,261 --> 00:20:11,847
You weren't big enough.

140
00:20:11,931 --> 00:20:14,642
- Mother, you know what?
- What?

141
00:20:14,725 --> 00:20:17,519
We're not the only deer in the forest.

142
00:20:17,603 --> 00:20:20,940
- Where did you hear that?
- Thumper told me.

143
00:20:21,023 --> 00:20:23,317
Well, he's right.

144
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,070
There are many deer
in the forest besides us.

145
00:20:26,153 --> 00:20:28,906
Then why don't I ever see them?

146
00:20:28,989 --> 00:20:31,784
- You will, sometime.
- On the meadow?

147
00:20:31,867 --> 00:20:33,577
Perhaps.

148
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:35,704
Hush now.

149
00:20:36,914 --> 00:20:38,916
We're almost there.

150
00:20:48,467 --> 00:20:50,469
- The meadow.
- Wait.

151
00:20:50,928 --> 00:20:53,138
Bambi, wait.

152
00:20:54,765 --> 00:20:57,601
You must never rush out on the meadow.

153
00:20:57,685 --> 00:20:59,687
There might be danger.

154
00:21:00,688 --> 00:21:02,898
Out there, we're unprotected.

155
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:05,484
The meadow is wide and open,

156
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:08,320
and there are no trees or bushes
to hide us.

157
00:21:08,445 --> 00:21:10,781
So we have to be very careful.

158
00:21:12,116 --> 00:21:13,784
Wait here.

159
00:21:14,702 --> 00:21:20,040
I'll go out first. And if the meadow
is safe, I'll call you.

160
00:22:11,383 --> 00:22:14,386
Come on, Bambi. It's all right.

161
00:22:18,807 --> 00:22:20,809
Come on.

162
00:23:11,568 --> 00:23:13,654
Good morning, Prince Bambi.

163
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:16,156
Good morning, young prince.

164
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,992
Hello. What ya eatin'?

165
00:23:19,076 --> 00:23:22,329
- Clover.
- It's awfully good.

166
00:23:22,412 --> 00:23:24,414
It's delicious.

167
00:23:24,498 --> 00:23:26,959
Why don't you try some?

168
00:23:29,503 --> 00:23:32,881
No, not that green stuff.

169
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,842
Just eat the blossoms.

170
00:23:35,926 --> 00:23:37,928
That's the good stuff.

171
00:23:39,221 --> 00:23:40,597
Thumper.

172
00:23:42,224 --> 00:23:46,186
- Yes, Mama?
- What did your father tell you?

173
00:23:46,603 --> 00:23:48,146
About what?

174
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:52,275
About eating the blossoms
and leaving the greens?

175
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:54,319
Oh, that one.

176
00:23:56,488 --> 00:24:00,200
Eating greens is a special treat.

177
00:24:00,283 --> 00:24:04,413
It makes long ears
and great big feet.

178
00:24:05,706 --> 00:24:09,710
But it sure is awful stuff to eat.

179
00:24:10,961 --> 00:24:13,880
I made that last part up myself.

180
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:19,553
Watch out.

181
00:25:22,991 --> 00:25:25,368
That's little Faline.

182
00:25:26,411 --> 00:25:29,372
He's kind of bashful, isn't he, Mama?

183
00:25:29,456 --> 00:25:33,210
Well, maybe he wouldn't be
if you'd say hello.

184
00:25:36,505 --> 00:25:38,423
Hello, Bambi.

185
00:25:42,552 --> 00:25:45,222
I said hello.

186
00:25:45,305 --> 00:25:47,599
Well, aren't you going to answer her?

187
00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:52,896
You're not afraid, are you?

188
00:25:56,316 --> 00:25:58,401
Well, then, go ahead.

189
00:26:04,783 --> 00:26:06,785
Go on, say hello.

190
00:26:10,622 --> 00:26:11,706
Hello.

191
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,122
You.

192
00:29:28,152 --> 00:29:30,530
He stopped and looked at me.

193
00:29:30,613 --> 00:29:32,907
Yes, I know.

194
00:29:33,449 --> 00:29:37,412
Why was everyone still
when he came on the meadow?

195
00:29:37,495 --> 00:29:39,664
Everyone respects him.

196
00:29:39,747 --> 00:29:45,586
For of all the deer in the forest,
not one has lived half so long.

197
00:29:46,629 --> 00:29:50,425
He's very brave and very wise.

198
00:29:51,634 --> 00:29:56,848
That's why he's known as
the Great Prince of the Forest.

199
00:31:03,998 --> 00:31:05,500
Faline.

200
00:31:08,586 --> 00:31:10,171
Bambi.

201
00:31:12,215 --> 00:31:13,633
Mother.

202
00:31:16,594 --> 00:31:18,137
Bambi.

203
00:31:25,728 --> 00:31:27,438
Mother.

204
00:32:07,812 --> 00:32:09,814
Come on out, Bambi.

205
00:32:12,275 --> 00:32:13,859
Come on.

206
00:32:14,485 --> 00:32:16,487
It's safe now.

207
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:19,448
We don't have to hide any longer.

208
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:25,538
What happened, Mother?
Why did we all run?

209
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:33,754
Man was in the forest.

210
00:34:13,979 --> 00:34:17,817
Mother, look.
What's all that white stuff?

211
00:34:19,068 --> 00:34:21,487
Why, it's snow.

212
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:24,156
- Snow?
- Yes.

213
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,242
Winter has come.

214
00:35:30,055 --> 00:35:32,266
Hiya, Bambi.

215
00:35:32,891 --> 00:35:35,144
Watch what I can do.

216
00:35:50,784 --> 00:35:53,537
Come on. It's all right.

217
00:35:53,621 --> 00:35:55,039
Look.

218
00:35:55,873 --> 00:35:57,833
The water's stiff.

219
00:36:13,891 --> 00:36:16,727
Some fun, huh, Bambi?

220
00:36:19,563 --> 00:36:22,358
Come on, get up. Like this.

221
00:37:03,023 --> 00:37:05,776
Kinda wobbly, aren't you?

222
00:37:26,964 --> 00:37:30,551
Got to watch both ends
at the same time.

223
00:37:36,265 --> 00:37:38,433
Guess you better unwind it.

224
00:38:33,322 --> 00:38:36,158
Wake up. Wake up, Flower.

225
00:38:39,828 --> 00:38:42,706
Is it spring yet?

226
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:45,917
No. Winter's just started.

227
00:38:46,752 --> 00:38:49,379
What you doing? Hibernating?

228
00:38:55,218 --> 00:38:57,512
What do you want to do that for?

229
00:38:59,097 --> 00:39:02,934
All us flowers sleep in the winter.

230
00:39:06,688 --> 00:39:10,734
Well, good night.

231
00:40:19,886 --> 00:40:23,306
Winter sure is long, isn't it?

232
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:25,392
It seems long.

233
00:40:26,143 --> 00:40:28,687
But it won't last forever.

234
00:40:33,066 --> 00:40:35,277
I'm awful hungry, Mother.

235
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,696
Yes, I know.

236
00:40:47,122 --> 00:40:49,166
Bambi, come here.

237
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:52,460
Look.

238
00:40:52,544 --> 00:40:55,005
New spring grass.

239
00:41:18,486 --> 00:41:20,280
Bambi. Quick.

240
00:41:20,363 --> 00:41:22,699
The thicket.

241
00:41:26,995 --> 00:41:29,748
Faster. Faster, Bambi.

242
00:41:29,831 --> 00:41:33,335
Don't look back. Keep running.

243
00:41:33,418 --> 00:41:35,545
Keep running.

244
00:41:47,641 --> 00:41:49,643
We made it.

245
00:41:49,726 --> 00:41:51,728
We made it, Mother.

246
00:41:52,604 --> 00:41:53,939
We...

247
00:41:54,731 --> 00:41:56,733
Mother.

248
00:42:08,328 --> 00:42:10,997
Mother, where are you?

249
00:42:51,454 --> 00:42:54,416
Your mother can't be with you anymore.

250
00:43:10,807 --> 00:43:12,851
Come.

251
00:43:13,643 --> 00:43:15,603
My son.

252
00:43:37,917 --> 00:43:40,462
<i>Let's sing a gay little spring song</i>

253
00:43:41,254 --> 00:43:44,048
<i>This is the season to sing</i>

254
00:43:44,132 --> 00:43:47,886
<i>So I'd like to suggest
That we all do our best</i>

255
00:43:48,011 --> 00:43:51,014
<i>And warble a song about spring</i>

256
00:43:51,097 --> 00:43:53,308
<i>Spring, spring, spring</i>

257
00:43:53,433 --> 00:43:56,019
<i>Let's get together and sing</i>

258
00:44:00,607 --> 00:44:03,318
<i>Let's sing a gay little spring song</i>

259
00:44:04,235 --> 00:44:07,113
<i>Just like bird on the wing</i>

260
00:44:07,197 --> 00:44:10,700
<i>Things always seem right
When you're cheerful and bright</i>

261
00:44:10,783 --> 00:44:13,494
<i>So let's get together and sing</i>

262
00:44:13,578 --> 00:44:16,122
<i>Sing, sing, sing</i>

263
00:44:16,206 --> 00:44:19,209
<i>Let's sing a song about spring</i>

264
00:44:19,292 --> 00:44:23,004
<i>Let's twitter and tweet

265
00:44:23,087 --> 00:44:26,424
<i>Get into the mood
And be merry today</i>

266
00:44:26,507 --> 00:44:29,928
<i>Forget all your troubles
And warble away...</i>

267
00:44:30,011 --> 00:44:32,013
Wait.

268
00:44:32,096 --> 00:44:34,098
What now?

269
00:44:36,434 --> 00:44:38,603
Hey.

270
00:44:39,437 --> 00:44:41,147
Stop that racket.

271
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:42,774
Scat.

272
00:44:44,609 --> 00:44:47,236
<i>Let's sing a song about spring</i>

273
00:44:48,029 --> 00:44:50,031
I'll fix 'em.

274
00:44:57,121 --> 00:45:01,668
There. I guess that'll teach 'em.

275
00:45:06,297 --> 00:45:08,883
Oh, what's the use?

276
00:45:12,053 --> 00:45:15,181
<i>This is the season to sing...</i>

277
00:45:18,226 --> 00:45:21,104
Same thing every spring.

278
00:45:28,444 --> 00:45:30,822
Love's sweet song.

279
00:45:32,573 --> 00:45:35,159
Pain in the pin feathers, I call it.

280
00:45:55,596 --> 00:45:57,598
Stop it.

281
00:46:00,226 --> 00:46:02,603
Get out of here. All of you.

282
00:46:05,648 --> 00:46:07,984
And you, too.

283
00:46:08,067 --> 00:46:12,280
Hello, Friend Owl.
Don't you remember me?

284
00:46:12,363 --> 00:46:14,615
Why, it's the young prince.

285
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:16,367
Bambi!

286
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:20,455
My, my, how you've changed.

287
00:46:20,538 --> 00:46:23,666
Turn round there.
Let me look at you.

288
00:46:23,749 --> 00:46:27,879
I see you've traded in your spots
for a pair of antlers.

289
00:46:30,715 --> 00:46:35,928
You know, just the other day
I was talking to myself about you.

290
00:46:36,053 --> 00:46:38,931
And we were wondering
what had become of you.

291
00:46:39,015 --> 00:46:41,017
Hello, Bambi.

292
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:44,312
Remember me?

293
00:46:45,104 --> 00:46:46,147
Thumper.

294
00:46:47,315 --> 00:46:48,733
Right.

295
00:46:53,321 --> 00:46:55,323
Hi, fellas.

296
00:46:55,406 --> 00:46:57,033
Flower.

297
00:46:57,783 --> 00:46:59,619
Yeah.

298
00:47:10,171 --> 00:47:13,049
Well, what's the matter with them?

299
00:47:13,132 --> 00:47:15,509
Why are they acting that way?

300
00:47:16,093 --> 00:47:18,262
Why, don't you know?

301
00:47:19,013 --> 00:47:20,640
They're "twitterpated".

302
00:47:22,016 --> 00:47:23,517
Twitterpated?

303
00:47:23,601 --> 00:47:24,769
Yes. Nearly everybody gets twitterpated
in the spring time.

304
00:47:24,769 --> 00:47:28,397
Yes. Nearly everybody gets twitterpated
in the spring time.

305
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,862
For example,

306
00:47:35,446 --> 00:47:39,200
you're walking along,
minding your own business,

307
00:47:39,283 --> 00:47:43,371
you're looking neither to the left
nor to the right,

308
00:47:43,454 --> 00:47:45,456
when all of a sudden

309
00:47:45,539 --> 00:47:49,460
you run smack into a pretty face.

310
00:47:54,757 --> 00:47:58,469
You begin to get weak in the knees.

311
00:47:58,552 --> 00:48:00,638
Your head's in a whirl.

312
00:48:01,931 --> 00:48:05,017
And then you feel light as a feather.

313
00:48:05,101 --> 00:48:07,269
And before you know it,

314
00:48:07,353 --> 00:48:10,064
you're walking on air.

315
00:48:14,151 --> 00:48:16,153
And then you know what?

316
00:48:16,237 --> 00:48:18,739
You're knocked for a loop.

317
00:48:18,823 --> 00:48:21,701
And you completely lose your head.

318
00:48:24,161 --> 00:48:26,122
Gosh, that's awful.

319
00:48:26,205 --> 00:48:28,207
- Gee whiz.
- Terrible.

320
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:30,209
And that ain't all.

321
00:48:30,292 --> 00:48:33,170
It can happen to anybody.

322
00:48:33,963 --> 00:48:36,632
So you'd better be careful.

323
00:48:37,258 --> 00:48:40,928
It could happen to you, and you, and...

324
00:48:43,014 --> 00:48:45,975
Yes, it could even happen to you.

325
00:48:48,436 --> 00:48:51,188
Well, it's not going to happen to me.

326
00:48:51,272 --> 00:48:54,066
- Me neither.
- Me neither.

327
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:44,260
Twitterpated.

328
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:36,121
Hello, Bambi.

329
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,042
Don't you remember me?

330
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,882
I'm Faline.

331
00:53:53,448 --> 00:53:54,825
Bambi.

332
00:55:46,269 --> 00:55:49,105
<i>I bring you a song</i>

00:55:49,898 --> 00:55:53,985
<i>And I sing as I go</i>

334
00:55:54,069 --> 00:55:57,197
<i>For I want you to know</i>

335
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:01,827
<i>That I'm looking for romance</i>

336
00:56:02,869 --> 00:56:06,581
<i>I bring you a song</i>

337
00:56:06,665 --> 00:56:10,418
<i>In the hope that you'll see</i>

338
00:56:10,502 --> 00:56:13,338
<i>When you're looking at me</i>

339
00:56:13,421 --> 00:56:16,675
<i>That I'm looking for love</i>

340
00:56:18,885 --> 00:56:21,972
<i>I'm seeking that glow</i>

341
00:56:22,055 --> 00:56:24,808
<i>Only found when you're young
and it's May</i>

342
00:56:24,891 --> 00:56:27,894
<i>Only found on that wonderful day</i>

343
00:56:27,978 --> 00:56:29,980
<i>When all longing is through</i>

344
00:56:32,357 --> 00:56:35,360
<i>I'm seeking that glow</i>

345
00:56:35,485 --> 00:56:38,613
<i>Only found when a thrill is complete</i>

346
00:56:38,738 --> 00:56:41,992
<i>Only found when two hearts gently beat</i>

347
00:56:42,075 --> 00:56:48,832
<i>To the strains of a waltz
That's both tender and new</i>

348
00:56:48,915 --> 00:56:52,335
<i>I bring you a song</i>

349
00:56:52,419 --> 00:56:56,256
<i>For I'm seeking romance</i>

350
00:56:56,381 --> 00:56:59,175
<i>You're by my side
There's a moon up above</i>

351
00:56:59,259 --> 00:57:02,262
<i>It shines with a light
That's so mellow and bright</i>

352
00:57:02,345 --> 00:57:08,101
<i>It's easy to see
That tonight we shall fall in love</i>

353
00:57:17,986 --> 00:57:22,115
<i>I bring you a song</i>

354
00:57:22,198 --> 00:57:25,327
<i>For I'm seeking romance</i>

355
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:28,955
<i>And you</i>

356
00:58:43,488 --> 00:58:46,282
It is Man.

357
00:58:46,366 --> 00:58:48,368
He is here again.

358
00:58:50,328 --> 00:58:52,956
There are many this time.

359
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,752
We must go deep into the forest.

360
00:58:57,836 --> 00:58:59,838
Hurry. Follow me.

361
00:59:02,215 --> 00:59:03,591
Faline.

362
00:59:20,149 --> 00:59:22,193
Bambi, where are you?

363
00:59:37,458 --> 00:59:38,835
Faline.

364
01:00:20,168 --> 01:00:21,711
Listen.

365
01:00:21,878 --> 01:00:23,796
- He's coming.
- Hush.

366
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,798
Be quiet.

367
01:00:26,758 --> 01:00:30,928
- He's coming closer.
- Be calm. Don't get excited.

368
01:00:31,846 --> 01:00:35,058
- We better fly.
- No. No, don't fly.

369
01:00:35,141 --> 01:00:37,268
Whatever you do, don't fly.

370
01:00:37,352 --> 01:00:40,897
He's almost here.
I can't stand it any longer.

371
01:00:56,704 --> 01:00:59,082
Bambi.

372
01:01:14,305 --> 01:01:15,473
Faline.

373
01:02:31,841 --> 01:02:33,634
Quick, Faline. Jump.

374
01:04:07,103 --> 01:04:09,021
Get up, Bambi.

375
01:04:13,234 --> 01:04:15,194
Get up.

376
01:04:19,532 --> 01:04:21,492
You must get up.

377
01:04:24,995 --> 01:04:26,956
Get up.

378
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:29,792
Get up.

379
01:04:33,712 --> 01:04:36,549
Now, come with me.

380
01:06:44,635 --> 01:06:45,969
Bambi.

381
01:07:27,511 --> 01:07:29,805
Wake up. Wake up, Friend Owl.

382
01:07:29,888 --> 01:07:32,182
Wake up, Friend Owl.

383
01:07:33,475 --> 01:07:35,436
What now?

384
01:07:36,895 --> 01:07:39,606
Hey, what's going on around here?

385
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:41,316
- It's happened.
- Happened?

386
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,402
Yes. In the thicket.

387
01:07:43,485 --> 01:07:45,446
Hurry up, Bambi.

388
01:07:45,529 --> 01:07:48,907
Yes, Papa. I'm coming.

389
01:08:17,853 --> 01:08:21,273
Oh. Well.

390
01:08:27,446 --> 01:08:28,947
Look.

391
01:08:30,157 --> 01:08:31,700
Two of them.

392
01:08:38,874 --> 01:08:44,880
Well, I don't believe I've ever seen
a more likely looking pair of fawns.

393
01:08:44,963 --> 01:08:48,050
Prince Bambi ought to be mighty proud.

394
01:08:52,304 --> 01:09:00,062
<i>Love is a song that never ends</i>

395
01:09:00,687 --> 01:09:08,278
<i>One simple theme repeating</i>

396
01:09:09,571 --> 01:09:13,075
<i>Like the voice</i>

397
01:09:13,158 --> 01:09:19,289
<i>Of a heavenly choir</i>

398
01:09:19,373 --> 01:09:23,502
<i>Love's sweet music</i>

399
01:09:23,585 --> 01:09:27,547
<i>Flows on</i>
