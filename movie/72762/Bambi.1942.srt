1
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:17,809
Love is a song that never ends

2
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:23,690
Life may be swift and fleeting

3
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:29,195
Hope may die Yet love's beautiful music

4
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,909
Comes each day like the dawn

5
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:40,498
Love is a song that never ends

6
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:46,337
One simple theme repeating

7
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:52,093
Like the voice of a heavenly choir

8
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:58,766
Love's sweet music flows on

9
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:11,654
Like the voice of a heavenly choir

10
00:01:12,489 --> 00:02:55,132
Love's sweet music flows on

11
00:04:49,406 --> 00:04:50,824
起床！起床！
Wake up.

12
00:04:51,283 --> 00:04:53,244
又怎么了啊？
-What now? 

13
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:54,828
快点起床喔！猫头鹰
-Wake up, Friend Owl.

14
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,413
到底发生什么事？
What's going on around here?

15
00:04:56,622 --> 00:04:58,457
起床！有大事发生了！
-Wake up. -It's happened.

16
00:04:58,624 --> 00:04:59,792
新的王子诞生了！
The new prince is born.

17
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,043
我们要去看它哟！
-We're going to see him. 

18
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,711
对！要看就快点哟！
-Come on. You better hurry up.

19
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,672
走喔！大家快喔！
Well, look.

20
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,650
好可爱哟！
-Well. -Isn't he cute?

21
00:05:29,488 --> 00:05:33,951
真难得的场面，太热闹了
Well, this is quite an occasion.

22
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:35,619
当然了，这也难怪了
Yes, sir, it isn't every day a prince is born.

23
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:38,497
不是每天都有王子出生的
Not every day, the prince was born

24
00:05:38,622 --> 00:05:41,959
你们应该好好的道贺一下
You're to be congratulated.

25

27
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:51,100


28
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,802
我们有客人来了！
We have company.

29
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,649
Hello. Hello, there.

30
00:05:58,517 --> 00:06:00,519
你好啊，小可爱！
-Hello, little prince.

你好啊！
-Hello. Hello, there.

32
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,648
你好啊，小王子！
Hello, little prince.

33
00:06:22,624 --> 00:06:25,502
你们看，它想要站起来了
Look. He's trying to get up.

34
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:50,986
它还是站得摇摇晃晃的
Kinda wobbly, isn't he?

35
00:06:51,153 --> 00:06:52,154
桑普！
Thumper.

36
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:56,158
我说的没错啊
Well, he is.

37
00:06:58,702 --> 00:06:59,828
你说是不是？
Aren't you?

38
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,504
我看它是有点困了
Looks to me like he's getting kind of sleepy.

39
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,047
这样好了，我们应该先走了

40
00:07:10,172 --> 00:07:11,715
让它好好休息休息

41
00:07:12,382 --> 00:07:16,929
好了，我们该走了，各位
I think it's time we all left.

42
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,686


43
00:07:18,096 --> 00:07:19,431
快走啊！
Come on.

44
00:07:19,556 --> 00:07:21,475

桑普，快走了！
Thumper. Come on.

46
00:07:40,786 --> 00:07:43,205
你要给它取什么名字啊？
Whatcha gonna call him?

47
00:07:44,706 --> 00:07:45,666
这个嘛…
Well, 

48
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,293
我想就叫它 “斑比” 好了
I think I'll call him Bambi.

49
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,836
斑比…
Bambi

50
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:54,800
可以，这个名字满不错的
Yep, I guess that'll do all right.

51
00:07:56,218 --> 00:07:59,680
斑比…我的小斑比
Bambi.My little Bambi.

52
00:08:30,252 --> 00:08:32,670
你看谁来了 ？它已经会走路了
Walking already. Well, what do you know.

53
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:50,564
早安！
-Good morning.

54
00:08:51,148 --> 00:08:52,315
早安啊，桂太太！
-Good morning, Mrs Quail.

55
00:08:52,774 --> 00:08:55,360
早上怎么不见到小王子呢？
And where's the young prince this...

56
00:08:58,071 --> 00:08:59,531
早安啊，小王子！
-Good morning, Bambi. 

57
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,450
早安，小王子…
-Good morning, young prince.

58
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:05,912

59
00:09:09,624 --> 00:09:11,626
早安啊，小王子！

61
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,734
早安！
Good morning.

62
00:09:37,486 --> 00:09:39,738
今天天气不错哟！
Nice sunny day.

63
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:55,003
怎么了，它发生什么事情了 ？
-What's the matter? -What happened?

64
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,630
小王子跌倒了吗？
Did the young prince fall down?

65
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,757
它受伤了吗？
-Is he hurt? 

66
00:09:58,882 --> 00:10:01,092
没有，它很好啊！
-No, he's all right.

67
00:10:03,094 --> 00:10:05,013
它走路像不大稳
He doesn't walk very good, does he?

68
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:06,640
桑普！
Thumper.

69
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:09,893
什么事，妈妈？
Yes, Mama?

70
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:14,064
你爸爸今天早上 是怎么跟你说的
What did your father tell you this morning?

71
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:19,611
假如你不能说好听的话
If you can't say something nice,

72
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:26,743
那就…一句…一句也都不要说
don't say nothing at all.

73
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:30,664
斑比，要勇敢喔！
Come on, Bambi, get up. Try again.

74
00:10:30,872 --> 00:10:32,123
赶快起来，站起来喔！
Come on, get up.

75
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,875
对呀，起来嘛！斑比！

76
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:35,335
来试试看嘛！
-Get up.

快点，快点起来嘛！
-Try again.

78
00:11:09,411 --> 00:11:10,370
我很会敲打
I'm thumping. 

79
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:13,206
所以呢…大家都叫我桑普喔！
That's why they call me Thumper.

80
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,252
桑普！
Thumper!

81
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:39,232
跳过来呀！你可以跳得过来的
Come on. You can do it.

82
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,526

83
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:44,821
我表演给你看喔！

就像这样！
Like this.

85
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:06,968
你跳的还不够远喔！
You didn't hop far enough.

86
00:12:08,636 --> 00:12:11,598
对了，现在换另外一只脚
That's it. Now the other one.

87
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:24,736
天啊！刚才是怎么一回事啊？
Gee whiz, what happened that time?

88
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:44,923
那是一群小鸟喔！
Those are birds.

89
00:12:46,674 --> 00:12:47,759
鸟？

90
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,053
看！
Look,

91
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:52,514
它是在学说话

92
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,599
鸟！

93

它是在说：鸟！

00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,647
说 “鸟”

95
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,690

97
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:07,862
鸟！

98
00:13:08,363 --> 00:13:11,991
不对！不对！是 “鸟”
Bird.

99
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:16,412
快点说鸟嘛！快说啊！
Come on, say "bird," say "bird."

100
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,171
小鸟，小鸟
Say "bird." Say "bird." Come on, say "bird."

103
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:29,175
它说话了！它说话了…
He talked. He talked, Mama.

104
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:31,719
小王子说话了
The young prince said "bird."

105
00:13:31,803 --> 00:13:34,681
鸟…鸟
Bird, bird, bird...

106
00:13:54,158 --> 00:13:55,493
鸟！
Bird.

107
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,869
不对喔，斑比！
No, that's not a bird.

108
00:13:56,953 --> 00:13:59,914
那只不是鸟，那只是蝴蝶
That's a butterfly.

109
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:01,666
蝴蝶？
Butterfly?

不对，那是花！
No, that's a flower.

113
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:13,761
花？
-Flower? -It's pretty.

笑死我了
No, no, no, no.

119
00:14:42,874 --> 00:14:45,376
不是啦，你说错了
That's not a flower.

120
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,503
那只不是花，它是…
-He's a little...

121
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,046
没关系！
 -That's all right.

122
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:52,091
它喜欢叫我花，那就叫好了
e can call me a flower if he wants to.

123
00:14:54,135 --> 00:14:59,307
我不会在乎的

你真的说我…

127
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,995
Gosh.

128
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,711
我想我现在应该回家去了，斑比
I think I better go home now.

155
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,637
-Little April shower -With your beautiful sound

156
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,815
Drip, drip, drop Little April shower

157
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,443
Beating a tune As you fall all around

158
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,112
Drip, drip, drop Little April shower

159
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,782
What can compare With your beautiful sound?

160
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,910
Beautiful sound

161
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:56,103
妈妈，我们今天要做什么？
Mother, what we going to do today?

162
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,898
我要带你到草地上去
I'm going to take you to the meadow.

163
00:19:59,023 --> 00:20:02,192
草地？ 草地是什么呀？
Meadow? What's the meadow?

164
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,946
草地呀，是一个很好玩的地方
It's a very wonderful place.

165
00:20:06,113 --> 00:20:08,198
那为什么我们以前都没去呢？
Then why haven't we been there before?

166
00:20:08,324 --> 00:20:11,577
因为那个时候你年纪还小啊
You weren't big enough.

167
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,787
妈妈，你知道为什么吗？
-Mother, you know what? 

168
00:20:13,954 --> 00:20:15,205
什么？
-What?

169
00:20:15,331 --> 00:20:17,166
我们不是在这里唯一的鹿
We're not the only deer in the forest.

170
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,792
你从哪儿听来的？
-Where did you hear that? 

171
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,669
是桑普告诉我的
-Thumper told me.

172
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:22,338
它说的没错！
Well, he's right.

173
00:20:22,463 --> 00:20:26,008
除了我们之外 森林里面还有很多的鹿
There are many deer in the forest besides us.

174
00:20:26,216 --> 00:20:28,344
那为什么我们 都没有看到它们呢？
Then why don't I ever see them?

175
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,262
总有一天你会见到的
-You will, sometime. 

176
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,263
在草地上
-On the meadow?

177
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,473
说不定
Perhaps.

178
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,649
Hush now.

179
00:20:35,684 --> 00:20:38,062
我们就快要到了
We're almost there.

180
00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:52,910
草地！ 斑比…
-The meadow. -Wait.

181
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,792
斑比，等等
Bambi, wait.

182
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,789
千万不可以在草地上乱跑
You must never rush out on the meadow.

183
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,000
这样会有危险的
There might be danger.

184
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:03,170
在草地上我们得不到保护
Out there, we're unprotected.

185
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,339
草地非常的宽广
The meadow is wide and open,

186
00:21:05,506 --> 00:21:08,342
没有树，还有丛森来隐藏
and there are no trees or bushes to hide us.

187
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,761
所以我们要非常的小心
So we have to be very careful.

188
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:13,847
你在这里等我
Wait here.

189
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,724
我先走出去
I'll go out first. 

190
00:21:15,891 --> 00:21:19,353
假如草地很安全我就通知你
And if the meadow is safe, I'll call you.

191
00:22:10,988 --> 00:22:13,240
斑比，可以出来了
Come on, Bambi..

192
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,783
不要怕啊
 It's all right

193
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,455
快出来啊
Come on.

194
00:23:11,465 --> 00:23:13,926
早啊，斑比王子
Good morning, Prince Bambi.

195
00:23:14,885 --> 00:23:16,261
早，小王子！
Good morning, young prince.

196
00:23:16,386 --> 00:23:19,306
你好，你们在吃什么啊？
Hello. What ya eatin'?

197
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,183
木树！
-Clover. 

198
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,935
很像很好吃喔！
-It's awfully good.

199
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:24,561
美味可口喔！
It's delicious.

200
00:23:24,728 --> 00:23:26,813
你也吃吃看吧？
Why don't you try some?

201
00:23:29,691 --> 00:23:31,735
不对！不对，斑比
No, not that green stuff.

202
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:35,530
不那个东西，是花果
Just eat the blossoms.

203
00:23:35,656 --> 00:23:39,242
只吃花果，它是最美味的东西
That's the good stuff.

204
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,827
桑普！
Thumper.

205
00:23:41,161 --> 00:23:43,955
什么事，妈妈？
-Yes, Mama? 

206
00:23:44,081 --> 00:23:46,208
你爸爸是怎么告诉你的？
What did your father tell you?

207
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:48,377
有关于什么？
About what?

208
00:23:48,543 --> 00:23:51,922
关于吃花果留下绿叶的故事啊
About eating the blossoms and leaving the greens?

209
00:23:52,047 --> 00:23:54,800
原来是那个啊
Oh, that one.

210
00:23:55,092 --> 00:23:59,262
吃绿叶是特别的糟蹋
Eating greens is a special treat.

211
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:03,934
会长出长耳朵和大脚
It makes long ears and great big feet.

212
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,853
还有…还有呢？

213
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,773
不过绿叶的味道真的很难吃
But it sure is awful stuff to eat.

214
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,985
斑比，最后一句话是我自己编的
I made that last part up myself.

215
00:24:17,447 --> 00:24:20,367
小心喔，小心…
Watch out.

216
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,556
她是小芬妮
That's little Faline.

217
00:25:26,641 --> 00:25:28,935
妈妈，它会不好意思喔
He's kind of bashful, isn't he, Mama?

218
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,606
如果你跟他打声招呼就不会了
Well, maybe he wouldn't be if you'd say hello.

219
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,320
你好，斑比！
Hello, Bambi.

220
00:25:42,824 --> 00:25:43,867
你好啊！
I said hello.

221
00:25:45,285 --> 00:25:47,287
斑比，赶快回答她啊！
Well, aren't you going to answer her?

222
00:25:50,498 --> 00:25:52,918
你应该不会害怕，对不对？
You're not afraid, are you?

223
00:25:56,963 --> 00:25:57,797
赶快上前去啊
Well, then, go ahead.

224
00:26:04,804 --> 00:26:06,890
快说啊，快说你好！
Go on, say hello.

225
00:26:10,518 --> 00:26:11,770
你好！
Hello.

226
00:26:49,900 --> 00:28:27,121
You.

227
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:30,093
他停下来看着我
He stopped and looked at me.

228
00:29:30,718 --> 00:29:33,638
是啊，我知道
Yes, I know.

229
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:36,349
为什么它在草地上出现，大家都不动呢？
Why was everyone still when he came on the meadow?

230
00:29:38,434 --> 00:29:41,104
因为大家都很尊敬他
Everyone respects him.

231
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:43,314
森林里所有的鹿
For of all the deer in the forest, 

232
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:47,402
没有一只活得比他还要长久的
not one has lived half so long.

233
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,947
他既勇敢，又很贤能
He's very brave and very wise.

234
00:29:51,531 --> 00:29:56,285
所以他是大家公认的森林大王子
That's why he's known as the Great Prince of the Forest.

235
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:08,232
小玲 斑比！
Faline.

236
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,318
斑比
Bambi.

237
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,696
妈妈！
Mother.

238
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:17,950
斑比…
Bambi.

239
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:26,375
妈…
Mother.

240
00:31:29,212 --> 00:31:30,129
妈…

241
00:31:32,965 --> 00:31:34,425
妈…

242
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:09,168
斑比，可以出来了
Come on out, Bambi.

243
00:32:11,003 --> 00:32:13,422
现在已经很安全了
Come on.

244
00:32:14,298 --> 00:32:15,883
已经不必躲藏了
It's safe now.

245
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,344
快点出来啊！
We don't have to hide any longer.

246
00:32:20,596 --> 00:32:23,391
妈到底发生什么事了 ？
What happened, Mother? 

247
00:32:23,724 --> 00:32:25,601
为什么我们要躲呢？
Why did we all run?

248
00:32:28,938 --> 00:32:30,106
妈妈告诉你

249
00:32:30,523 --> 00:32:34,318
这是因为人类来到了森林
Man was in the forest.

250
00:34:13,876 --> 00:34:14,460
妈，快看
Mother, look. 

251
00:34:15,169 --> 00:34:17,129
外面那是什么？
What's all that white stuff?

252
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:21,091
啊，那是雪
Why, it's snow.

253
00:34:21,175 --> 00:34:22,134
雪？
-Snow? -Yes.

254
00:34:22,176 --> 00:34:25,888
对啊，因为冬天已经来了
Winter has come.

255
00:35:29,576 --> 00:35:32,037
你好啊，斑比！
Hiya, Bambi.

256
00:35:32,871 --> 00:35:35,791
过来这边，看看我的能耐！
Watch what I can do.

257
00:35:50,097 --> 00:35:52,057
过来，没关系嘛！
Come on. It's all right.

258
00:35:52,182 --> 00:35:57,229
你看！它已经凝固了
Look.The water's stiff.

259
00:36:12,328 --> 00:36:13,746
好好玩！
Some fun, 

260
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:15,956
对不对，斑比？
huh, Bambi?

261
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,503
起来嘛！像我这个样子
Come on, get up. Like this.

262
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,200
No, no, no.

263
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,047
你会摇摇晃晃的，对不对呀？斑比
Kinda wobbly, aren't you?

264
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:28,362
斑比，你不能光看前脚
Got to watch both ends at the same time.

265
00:37:28,904 --> 00:37:30,447
也要注意后脚嘛！

266
00:37:36,161 --> 00:37:38,497
我想你的脚不打结会比较好看
Guess you better unwind it.

267
00:38:33,218 --> 00:38:34,595
起床！起床了！
Wake up.

268
00:38:34,761 --> 00:38:36,722
该起床了！
 Wake up, Flower.

269
00:38:36,888 --> 00:38:42,019
春天到了吗？
Is it spring yet?

270
00:38:42,144 --> 00:38:46,607
没有，冬天才刚开始呢！
No. Winter's just started.

271
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:48,567
你在做什么啊？
What you doing?

272
00:38:48,734 --> 00:38:49,943
你在冬眠吗？
 Hibernating?

273
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:55,657
对呀！
yes

274
00:38:55,824 --> 00:38:58,744
那你为什么要冬眠呢？
What do you want to do that for?

275
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:05,292
就是我可以长时间的睡觉嘛！
All us flowers sleep in the winter.

276
00:39:06,585 --> 00:39:10,672
晚安了，两位！
Well, good night.

277
00:40:19,783 --> 00:40:23,120
冬天很漫长是不是，妈妈？
Winter sure is long, isn't it?

278
00:40:23,286 --> 00:40:25,288
感觉上很漫长
It seems long.

279
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:28,583
可是它不会永远持续下去的
But it won't last forever.

280
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:35,173
我肚子饿死了
I'm awful hungry, Mother.

281
00:40:35,257 --> 00:40:37,592
我知道，忍耐一下吧！
Yes, I know.

282
00:40:49,145 --> 00:40:52,983
斑比…过来呀！你看！
Bambi, come here.

283
00:40:53,483 --> 00:40:54,484
你看这里！
Look.

284
00:40:54,651 --> 00:40:58,655
这是春天刚刚长出来的草喔！
New spring grass.

285
00:41:17,757 --> 00:41:25,181
斑比，快点躲起来！快点！
Bambi. Quick.

286
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,519
The thicket.

287
00:41:30,812 --> 00:41:32,814
斑比，躲到草丛里！
Faster. Faster, Bambi.

288
00:41:33,273 --> 00:41:36,359
快点！别往后看！
Don't look back. Keep running.

289
00:41:36,443 --> 00:41:38,737
不停的跑！快跑啊！
Keep running.

290
00:41:47,537 --> 00:41:48,455
我们成功了！
We made it.

291
00:41:48,622 --> 00:41:50,957
我们跑回来了，妈妈！
We made it, Mother.

292
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:54,169
妈…
We...

293
00:41:54,294 --> 00:41:57,172
妈…
Mother.

294
00:41:59,841 --> 00:42:01,509
妈妈…！
Mother!

295
00:42:03,386 --> 00:42:09,392
妈妈…
Mother, where are you?

296
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,692
妈妈…
Mother!

297
00:42:22,572 --> 00:42:24,574
妈…
Mother!

298
00:42:26,576 --> 00:42:28,078
妈…
Mother!

299
00:42:34,292 --> 00:42:35,293
妈…
Mother!

300
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,103
Mother!

301
00:42:51,351 --> 00:42:54,312
你妈妈再也不能陪在你身边了
Your mother can't be with you anymore.

302
00:43:10,703 --> 00:43:12,747
好了，走吧！
Come.

303
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,542
跟我来！
My son.

304
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:40,074
Let's sing a gay little spring song

305
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:43,745
This is the season to sing

306
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:47,582
So I'd like to suggest That we all do our best

307
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:50,627
And warble a song about spring

308
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,129
Spring, spring, spring

309
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,423
Let's get together and sing

310
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,972
Let's sing a gay little spring song

311
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,768
Just like the bird on the wing

312
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:10,396
Things always seem right When you're cheerful and bright

313
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,149
So let's get together and sing

314
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,818
Sing, sing, sing

315
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,197
Let's sing a song about spring

316
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:22,700
Let's twitter and tweet Like the birdies in May

317
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:26,120
Get into the mood And be merry today

318
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,916
Forget all your troubles And warble away...

319
00:44:29,908 --> 00:44:31,576
怎么了 ？
Wait.

320
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,078
又怎么了 ？
What now?

321
00:44:36,372 --> 00:44:40,627
你们快走吧！
Hey.

322
00:44:40,793 --> 00:44:42,503
不要在这里吵
Stop that racket.
Scat.

323
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:44,380
快走！
Let's sing a song about spring

324
00:44:47,967 --> 00:44:51,888
好家伙，我要来修理他们
I'll fix 'em.

325
00:44:57,226 --> 00:44:59,896
好了，停下来了啊！
There. 

326
00:45:00,063 --> 00:45:02,273
你们也是得到教训了
I guess that'll teach them.

327
00:45:06,235 --> 00:45:08,446
没用啊！
Oh, what's the use?

328
00:45:18,122 --> 00:45:25,254
每年春天都在唱情歌
This is the season to sing...

329
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,715
甜蜜的情歌
Same thing every spring.

330
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,425
真烦死人了
Love's sweet song.

331
00:45:29,509 --> 00:45:31,427
哎哟！不要再唱了

332
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:34,347
真受不了，这些个家伙
Pain in the pin feathers, I call it.

333
00:45:55,493 --> 00:45:58,204
停下来！
Stop it.

334
00:46:02,041 --> 00:46:03,418
快滚开！
Get out of here. All of you.

335
00:46:04,127 --> 00:46:05,336
别摇了！
And you, too.

336
00:46:05,795 --> 00:46:06,879
你是谁啊你…

337
00:46:08,089 --> 00:46:10,049
你好啊，猫头鹰朋友
Hello, Friend Owl.

338
00:46:10,216 --> 00:46:11,843
你还记得我吗？
 Don't you remember me?

339
00:46:12,009 --> 00:46:14,637
原来是小王子啊
Why, it's the young prince.

340
00:46:14,762 --> 00:46:16,347
小王子斑比
Bambi!

341
00:46:16,556 --> 00:46:20,685
我的天啦，你长得都变了
My, my, how you've changed.

342
00:46:20,852 --> 00:46:22,937
来…转过来让我看看
Turn round there. Let me look at you.

343
00:46:24,272 --> 00:46:26,440
我猜呀…你是以你的斑
I see you've

344
00:46:26,607 --> 00:46:28,943
来换取一对鹿角，对不对啊？
 traded in your spots for a pair of antlers.

345
00:46:30,361 --> 00:46:31,404
你不知道啊？
You know, 

346
00:46:31,571 --> 00:46:33,447
前天啊…我还自己在想呢
just the other day I was talking to myself about you.

347
00:46:33,614 --> 00:46:36,576
我们不知道你变成什么样子了
And we were wondering what had become of you.

348
00:46:36,742 --> 00:46:38,661
而且我好想你喔！

349
00:46:38,911 --> 00:46:40,913
你好，斑比！
Hello, Bambi.

350
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:44,709
还记得我吗？
Remember me?

351
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:45,927


352
00:46:46,502 --> 00:46:47,295
是桑普！
Thumper.

353
00:46:47,461 --> 00:46:49,589
答对了！
Right.

354
00:46:53,176 --> 00:46:56,387
各位！
Hi, fellas.

355
00:46:56,554 --> 00:46:57,847
花！
Flower.

356
00:46:57,972 --> 00:47:00,433
对喔！
Yeah.

357
00:47:09,317 --> 00:47:12,612
他们是怎么搞的？
Well, what's the matter with them?

358
00:47:12,737 --> 00:47:15,364
怎么会有那种动作，好奇怪喔
Why are they acting that way?

359
00:47:19,827 --> 00:47:21,203
你们不知道吗？
Why, don't you know?

360
00:47:15,573 --> 00:47:19,660
难不成他们恋爱了
They're "twitterpated."


361
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:23,748
恋爱了…
Twitterpated?

362
00:47:23,873 --> 00:47:26,667
没错，到了春天了大家都这样的
Yes. Nearly everybody gets twitterpated in the spring time.

363
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:33,724
举个例
For example,

364
00:47:35,343 --> 00:47:39,096
你一个人走着在想心事
you're walking along, minding your own business,

365
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:43,267
你既不看左呢…也不看右
you're looking neither to the left nor to the right,

366
00:47:43,351 --> 00:47:49,357
突然间，你撞见一个漂亮的脸孔
when all of a sudden you run smack into a pretty face.

367
00:47:54,654 --> 00:47:58,366
两腿开始发软
You begin to get weak in the knees.

368
00:47:58,449 --> 00:48:00,534
然后…头昏眼花的
Your head's in a whirl.

369
00:48:01,327 --> 00:48:02,662
这感觉很奇怪哟

370
00:48:01,827 --> 00:48:02,495
接着呢…
And then

371
00:48:02,495 --> 00:48:03,913
你就感觉魂飞出去一样…
 you feel light as a feather.

372
00:48:03,955 --> 00:48:04,914
轻飘飘的

373
00:48:04,997 --> 00:48:07,166
还没弄清楚呢！
And before you know it,

374
00:48:07,249 --> 00:48:09,960
原来你是在空中漫步
you're walking on air.

375
00:48:14,048 --> 00:48:15,007
然后呢…你知道的
And then you know what?

376
00:48:15,007 --> 00:48:15,841
结果怎么样了 ？

377
00:48:16,133 --> 00:48:18,636
你会在空中，像这样的旋转
You're knocked for a loop.

378
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:20,262
整天的失去理智了
And you completely lose your head.

379
00:48:20,262 --> 00:48:21,597
就像这样

380
00:48:24,266 --> 00:48:25,976
真可怕
Gosh, that's awful.

381
00:48:26,102 --> 00:48:28,062
就是嘛！
-Gee whiz. -Terrible.

382
00:48:28,187 --> 00:48:29,063
不光是这样
And that ain't all.

383
00:48:30,189 --> 00:48:33,442
任何的动物都会碰上的
It can happen to anybody.

384
00:48:33,609 --> 00:48:36,237
劝你们要小心一点喔！
So you'd better be careful.

385
00:48:36,404 --> 00:48:38,489
会让你们碰上的
It could happen to you, .

386
00:48:38,656 --> 00:48:39,323
还有你！
and you, 

387
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:40,616
还有你
and..

388
00:48:40,783 --> 00:48:45,037
你也会碰上的
Yes, it could even happen to you.

389
00:48:45,204 --> 00:48:48,124
我说的都是真的喔

390
00:48:48,249 --> 00:48:51,210
不会发生在我身上，我敢保证
Well, it's not going to happen to me.

391
00:48:51,335 --> 00:48:52,086
我也不?
-Me neither..

392
00:48:52,253 --> 00:48:54,296
我也不?
Me neither

393
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:44,114
哼！恋爱
Twitterpated.

394
00:51:49,513 --> 00:51:50,597
你好啊！
Hello.

395
00:52:34,016 --> 00:52:36,518
斑比，你好啊！
Hello, Bambi.

396
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:39,563
你还记不记得我呢？
Don't you remember me?

397
00:52:39,771 --> 00:52:45,736
我是芬妮啊！
I'm Faline.

398
00:54:03,355 --> 00:54:04,147
斑比！
Bambi.

399
00:54:07,734 --> 00:54:09,194
斑比
Bambi.

400
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:49,261
I bring you a song

401
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:53,807
And I sing as I go

402
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:57,060
For I want you to know

403
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:01,648
That I'm looking for romance

404
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:06,487
I bring you a song

405
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:09,907
In the hope that you'll see

406
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:13,160
When you're looking at me

407
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:16,580
That I'm looking for love

408
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,668
I'm seeking that glow

409
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:24,546
Only found when you're young and it's May

410
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:27,674
Only found on that wonderful day

411
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:30,802
When all longing is through

412
00:56:32,096 --> 00:56:35,098
I'm seeking that glow

413
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:38,352
Only found when a thrill is complete

414
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:41,730
Only found when two hearts gently beat

415
00:56:41,814 --> 00:56:48,320
To the strains of a waltz That's both tender and new

416
00:56:49,113 --> 00:56:52,199
I bring you a song

417
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:55,953
For I'm seeking romance

418
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:58,914
You're by my side There's a moon up above

419
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:02,042
It shines with a light That's so mellow and bright

420
00:57:02,126 --> 00:57:07,923
It's easy to see That tonight we shall fall in love

421
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:21,979
I bring you a song

422
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:25,816
For I'm seeking romance

423
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,860
And you

424
00:58:43,384 --> 00:58:46,179
是人类！
It is Man.

425
00:58:46,262 --> 00:58:48,264
他们又来到这里了
He is here again.

426
00:58:50,225 --> 00:58:51,142
在这个时候会有很多的人类来这里
There are many this time.

427
00:58:55,396 --> 00:58:57,649
所以我们要躲入森林里面
We must go deep into the forest.

428
00:58:57,941 --> 00:58:59,567
快点！斑比，跟我走！
Hurry. Follow me.

429
00:59:02,028 --> 00:59:03,446
芬妮
Faline.

430
00:59:17,126 --> 00:59:18,253
斑比！
Bambi.

431
00:59:19,796 --> 00:59:21,589
斑比，你在哪里？
Bambi, where are you?

432
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,425
斑比…

433
00:59:31,182 --> 00:59:35,645
斑比…

434
00:59:37,105 --> 00:59:38,398
芬妮…
Faline.

435
00:59:40,525 --> 00:59:42,068
芬妮…

436
00:59:43,361 --> 00:59:45,280
芬妮…

437
01:00:19,605 --> 01:00:21,107
你听！
Listen.

438
01:00:21,274 --> 01:00:22,191
他来了！
-He's coming. -Hush.

439
01:00:22,358 --> 01:00:23,401
安静啊！
Be quiet.

440
01:00:23,526 --> 01:00:24,986
别紧张啊！
Be calm. Don't get excited.

441
01:00:26,404 --> 01:00:27,947
我们还是飞走好了
We better fly

442
01:00:28,156 --> 01:00:29,741
不行，不能飞啊！
No. No, don't fly.

443
01:00:31,743 --> 01:00:32,869
可是…

444
01:00:33,036 --> 01:00:35,747
不管怎么样，都不能飞呀！
Whatever you do, don't fly.

445
01:00:36,039 --> 01:00:37,165
太危险了！

446
01:00:37,248 --> 01:00:38,333
他就快到了！
He's almost here. 

447
01:00:38,583 --> 01:00:40,668
我受不了了
I can't stand it any longer.

448
01:00:55,808 --> 01:00:58,394
斑比…
Bambi.

449
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:15,337
芬妮
Faline.

450
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,001
斑比…
Bambi! Bambi!

451
01:02:31,737 --> 01:02:32,530
芬妮，快走
Quick, Faline. Jump.

452
01:04:06,957 --> 01:04:08,751
站起来，斑比！
Get up, Bambi.

453
01:04:12,755 --> 01:04:14,215
站起来！
Get up.

454
01:04:19,386 --> 01:04:20,679
你一定要站起来！
You must get up.

455
01:04:24,683 --> 01:04:26,018
起来！
Get up.

456
01:04:27,311 --> 01:04:28,521
快站起来！
Get up.

457
01:04:33,609 --> 01:04:35,778
跟我走！
Now, come with me.

458
01:04:35,861 --> 01:04:36,445
快点！

459
01:06:44,531 --> 01:06:45,824
斑比！
Bambi.

460
01:07:27,408 --> 01:07:30,702
起床！起床哦！猫头鹰博士
Wake up. Wake up, Friend Owl.

461
01:07:30,869 --> 01:07:32,496
起床哦！
Wake up, Friend Owl.

462
01:07:32,663 --> 01:07:34,123
发…发生什么事了 ？
What now?

463
01:07:34,289 --> 01:07:35,332
到底怎么回事啊？

464
01:07:35,499 --> 01:07:38,627
这怎么回事啊？
Hey, what's going on around here?

465
01:07:38,794 --> 01:07:40,754
发生了！
-It's happened. -Happened?

466
01:07:40,921 --> 01:07:41,713
发生什么了？
Yes. In the thicket.

467
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:45,676
对喔，在草丛里面！斑比，快点
Hurry up, Bambi.

468
01:07:45,843 --> 01:07:48,387
是的，爸爸！我来了
Yes, Papa. I'm coming.

469
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:20,345
Oh. Well.

470
01:08:27,551 --> 01:08:29,011
你们看！
Look.

471
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:33,891
有两只呢！好可爱喔！
Two of them.

472
01:08:38,478 --> 01:08:41,148
我还真不敢相信哪！
Well, I don't believe I've ever seen a more likely looking pair of fawns.

473
01:08:41,231 --> 01:08:43,859
他们两个长得好像小斑比

474
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:47,487
斑比王子一定感到无限的骄傲
Prince Bambi ought to be mighty proud.

475
01:08:52,169 --> 01:08:54,962
Love is a song

476
01:08:55,047 --> 01:09:00,301
That never ends

477
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:03,596
One simple theme

478
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:08,101
Repeating

479
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:12,688
Like the voice

480
01:09:12,773 --> 01:09:16,317
Of a heavenly choir

481
01:09:19,154 --> 01:09:23,116
Love's sweet music

482
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:42,552
Flows on
