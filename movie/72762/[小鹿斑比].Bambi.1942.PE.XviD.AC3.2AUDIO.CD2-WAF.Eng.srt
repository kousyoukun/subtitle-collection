1
00:00:05,954 --> 00:00:09,791
Mother, look.
What's all that white stuff?

2
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:13,462
Why, it's snow.

3
00:00:13,545 --> 00:00:16,131
- Snow?
- Yes.

4
00:00:16,214 --> 00:00:18,216
Winter has come.

5
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,241
Hiya, Bambi.

6
00:01:24,825 --> 00:01:27,119
Watch what I can do.

7
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,512
Come on. It's all right.

8
00:01:45,595 --> 00:01:47,013
Look.

9
00:01:47,848 --> 00:01:49,850
The water's stiff.

10
00:02:05,866 --> 00:02:08,702
Some fun, huh, Bambi?

11
00:02:11,538 --> 00:02:14,332
Come on, get up. Like this.

12
00:02:54,998 --> 00:02:57,751
Kinda wobbly, aren't you?

13
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:22,567
Got to watch both ends
at the same time.

14
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,409
Guess you better unwind it.

15
00:04:25,297 --> 00:04:28,133
Wake up. Wake up, Flower.

16
00:04:31,803 --> 00:04:34,681
Is it spring yet?

17
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:37,893
No. Winter's just started.

18
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:41,354
What you doing? Hibernating?

19
00:04:47,194 --> 00:04:49,488
What do you want to do that for?

20
00:04:51,073 --> 00:04:54,910
All us flowers sleep in the winter.

21
00:04:58,663 --> 00:05:02,751
Well, good night.

22
00:06:11,862 --> 00:06:15,282
Winter sure is long, isn't it?

23
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:17,367
It seems long.

24
00:06:18,118 --> 00:06:20,662
But it won't last forever.

25
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,252
I'm awful hungry, Mother.

26
00:06:27,335 --> 00:06:29,671
Yes, I know.

27
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:41,141
Bambi, come here.

28
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,436
Look.

29
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,022
New spring grass.

30
00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:12,255
Bambi. Quick.

31
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:14,674
The thicket.

32
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,723
Faster. Faster, Bambi.

33
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:25,310
Don't look back. Keep running.

34
00:07:25,394 --> 00:07:27,521
Keep running.

35
00:07:39,616 --> 00:07:41,618
We made it.

36
00:07:41,701 --> 00:07:43,703
We made it, Mother.

37
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:45,914
We...

38
00:07:46,706 --> 00:07:48,708
Mother.

39
00:08:00,303 --> 00:08:03,014
Mother, where are you?

40
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,391
Your mother can't be with you anymore.

41
00:09:02,783 --> 00:09:04,826
Come.

42
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:07,621
My son.

43
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:32,437
<i>Let's sing a gay little spring song</i>

44
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,024
<i>This is the season to sing</i>

45
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:39,903
<i>So I'd like to suggest
That we all do our best</i>

46
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:42,989
<i>And warble a song about spring</i>

47
00:09:43,073 --> 00:09:45,325
<i>Spring, spring, spring</i>

48
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:47,994
<i>Let's get together and sing</i>

49
00:09:52,582 --> 00:09:55,293
<i>Let's sing a gay little spring song</i>

50
00:09:56,211 --> 00:09:59,089
<i>Just like bird on the wing</i>

51
00:09:59,172 --> 00:10:02,676
<i>Things always seem right
When you're cheerful and bright</i>

52
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:05,470
<i>So let's get together and sing</i>

53
00:10:05,554 --> 00:10:08,098
<i>Sing, sing, sing</i>

54
00:10:08,181 --> 00:10:11,184
<i>Let's sing a song about spring</i>

55
00:10:11,268 --> 00:10:14,980
<i>Let's twitter and tweet
Like the birdies in May</i>

56
00:10:15,063 --> 00:10:18,400
<i>Get into the mood
And be merry today</i>

57
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:21,903
<i>Forget all your troubles
And warble away...</i>

58
00:10:21,987 --> 00:10:23,989
Wait.

59
00:10:24,072 --> 00:10:26,074
What now?

60
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,579
Hey.

61
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:33,123
Stop that racket.

62
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:34,750
Scat.

63
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:39,212
<i>Let's sing a song about spring</i>

64
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:42,007
I'll fix 'em.

65
00:10:49,097 --> 00:10:53,643
There. I guess that'll teach 'em.

66
00:10:58,273 --> 00:11:00,859
Oh, what's the use?

67
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:07,157
<i>This is the season to sing...</i>

68
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:13,080
Same thing every spring.

69
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,798
Love's sweet song.

70
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:27,135
Pain in the pin feathers, I call it.

71
00:11:47,572 --> 00:11:49,574
Stop it.

72
00:11:52,202 --> 00:11:54,621
Get out of here. All of you.

73
00:11:57,624 --> 00:11:59,960
And you, too.

74
00:12:00,043 --> 00:12:04,256
Hello, Friend Owl.
Don't you remember me?

75
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:06,591
Why, it's the young prince.

76
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:08,343
Bambi!

77
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:12,431
My, my, how you've changed.

78
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:15,642
Turn round there.
Let me look at you.

79
00:12:15,726 --> 00:12:19,855
I see you've traded in your spots
for a pair of antlers.

80
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:27,946
You know, just the other day
I was talking to myself about you.

81
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:30,907
And we were wondering
what had become of you.

82
00:12:30,991 --> 00:12:32,993
Hello, Bambi.

83
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,329
Remember me?

84
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,123
Thumper.

85
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,709
Right.

86
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,299
Hi, fellas.

87
00:12:47,382 --> 00:12:49,009
Flower.

88
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,595
Yeah.

89
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:05,025
Well, what's the matter with them?

90
00:13:05,108 --> 00:13:07,486
Why are they acting that way?

91
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,238
Why, don't you know?

92
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:12,657
They're "twitterpated".

93
00:13:13,992 --> 00:13:15,494
Twitterpated?

94
00:13:15,577 --> 00:13:20,373
Yes. Nearly everybody gets twitterpated
in the spring time.

95
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:26,838
For example,

96
00:13:27,422 --> 00:13:31,176
you're walking along,
minding your own business,

97
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:35,347
you're looking neither to the left
nor to the right,

98
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,432
when all of a sudden

99
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:41,436
you run smack into a pretty face.

100
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:50,445
You begin to get weak in the knees.

101
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,614
Your head's in a whirl.

102
00:13:53,907 --> 00:13:56,993
And then you feel light as a feather.

103
00:13:57,077 --> 00:13:59,246
And before you know it,

104
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:02,040
you're walking on air.

105
00:14:06,128 --> 00:14:08,130
And then you know what?

106
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:10,716
You're knocked for a loop.

107
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,677
And you completely lose your head.

108
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:18,098
Gosh, that's awful.

109
00:14:18,181 --> 00:14:20,183
- Gee whiz.
- Terrible.

110
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:22,185
And that ain't all.

111
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:25,147
It can happen to anybody.

112
00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:28,608
So you'd better be careful.

113
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:32,946
It could happen to you, and you, and...

114
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,951
Yes, it could even happen to you.

115
00:14:40,454 --> 00:14:43,165
Well, it's not going to happen to me.

116
00:14:43,248 --> 00:14:46,042
- Me neither.
- Me neither.

117
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:36,236
Twitterpated.

118
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:28,098
Hello, Bambi.

119
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:32,018
Don't you remember me?

120
00:18:36,857 --> 00:18:38,859
I'm Faline.

121
00:19:45,425 --> 00:19:46,802
Bambi.

122
00:21:38,246 --> 00:21:41,083
<i>I bring you a song</i>

123
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:45,962
<i>And I sing as I go</i>

124
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:49,174
<i>For I want you to know</i>

125
00:21:49,257 --> 00:21:53,804
<i>That I'm looking for romance</i>

126
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:58,558
<i>I bring you a song</i>

127
00:21:58,642 --> 00:22:02,396
<i>In the hope that you'll see</i>

128
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:05,315
<i>When you're looking at me</i>

129
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:08,693
<i>That I'm looking for love</i>

130
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,949
<i>I'm seeking that glow</i>

131
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,785
<i>Only found when you're young
and it's May</i>

132
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:19,871
<i>Only found on that wonderful day</i>

133
00:22:19,955 --> 00:22:21,957
<i>When all longing is through</i>

134
00:22:24,334 --> 00:22:27,379
<i>I'm seeking that glow</i>

135
00:22:27,462 --> 00:22:30,632
<i>Only found when a thrill is complete</i>

136
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,969
<i>Only found when two hearts gently beat</i>

137
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:40,809
<i>To the strains of a waltz
That's both tender and new</i>

138
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:44,312
<i>I bring you a song</i>

139
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:48,275
<i>For I'm seeking romance</i>

140
00:22:48,358 --> 00:22:51,153
<i>You're by my side
There's a moon up above</i>

141
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:54,239
<i>It shines with a light
That's so mellow and bright</i>

142
00:22:54,322 --> 00:23:00,078
<i>It's easy to see
That tonight we shall fall in love</i>

143
00:23:09,963 --> 00:23:14,092
<i>I bring you a song</i>

144
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:17,304
<i>For I'm seeking romance</i>

145
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:20,932
<i>And you</i>

146
00:24:35,465 --> 00:24:38,260
It is Man.

147
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:40,345
He is here again.

148
00:24:42,305 --> 00:24:44,933
There are many this time.

149
00:24:47,477 --> 00:24:49,730
We must go deep into the forest.

150
00:24:49,813 --> 00:24:51,815
Hurry. Follow me.

151
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:55,569
Faline.

152
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:14,212
Bambi, where are you?

153
00:25:29,436 --> 00:25:30,812
Faline.

154
00:26:12,145 --> 00:26:13,730
Listen.

155
00:26:13,814 --> 00:26:15,774
- He's coming.
- Hush.

156
00:26:15,857 --> 00:26:17,776
Be quiet.

157
00:26:18,735 --> 00:26:22,906
- He's coming closer.
- Be calm. Don't get excited.

158
00:26:23,824 --> 00:26:27,035
- We better fly.
- No. No, don't fly.

159
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,246
Whatever you do, don't fly.

160
00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:32,874
He's almost here.
I can't stand it any longer.

161
00:26:48,682 --> 00:26:51,101
Bambi.

162
00:27:06,283 --> 00:27:07,451
Faline.

163
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:25,612
Quick, Faline. Jump.

164
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,041
Get up, Bambi.

165
00:30:05,212 --> 00:30:07,214
Get up.

166
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,512
You must get up.

167
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:18,934
Get up.

168
00:30:19,768 --> 00:30:21,770
Get up.

169
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,527
Now, come with me.

170
00:32:36,613 --> 00:32:37,948
Bambi.

171
00:33:19,489 --> 00:33:21,783
Wake up. Wake up, Friend Owl.

172
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:24,161
Wake up, Friend Owl.

173
00:33:25,454 --> 00:33:27,414
What now?

174
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:31,585
Hey, what's going on around here?

175
00:33:31,668 --> 00:33:33,295
- It's happened.
- Happened?

176
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:35,380
Yes. In the thicket.

177
00:33:35,464 --> 00:33:37,424
Hurry up, Bambi.

178
00:33:37,507 --> 00:33:40,886
Yes, Papa. I'm coming.

179
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:13,293
Oh. Well.

180
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:20,926
Look.

181
00:34:22,135 --> 00:34:23,678
Two of them.

182
00:34:30,852 --> 00:34:36,858
Well, I don't believe I've ever seen
a more likely looking pair of fawns.

183
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:40,028
Prince Bambi ought to be mighty proud.

184
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:52,082
<i>Love is a song that never ends</i>

185
00:34:52,666 --> 00:35:00,298
<i>One simple theme repeating</i>

186
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:05,053
<i>Like the voice</i>

187
00:35:05,137 --> 00:35:11,268
<i>Of a heavenly choir</i>

188
00:35:11,351 --> 00:35:15,480
<i>Love's sweet music</i>

189
00:35:15,564 --> 00:35:19,526
<i>Flows on</i>
