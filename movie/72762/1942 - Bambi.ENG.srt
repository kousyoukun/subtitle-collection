Wake up.

12
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,036
- What now?
- Wake up, Friend Owl.

13
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,031
What's going on around here?

14
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,270
- Wake up.
- It's happened.

15
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,237
The new prince is born.

16
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,630
- We're going to see him.
- Come on. You better hurry up.

17
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,071
Well, look.

18
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,718
- Well.
- Isn't he cute?

19
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,830
Well, this is quite an occasion.

20
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,554
Yes, sir,
it isn't every day a prince is born.

21
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,235
You're to be congratulated.

22
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,551
- Yes, congratulations.
- Congratulations.

23
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,551
Thank you very much.

24
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,109
Come on. Wake up.
We have company.

25
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,357
Hello. Hello, there.

26
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,398
- Hello, little prince.
- Hello. Hello, there.

27
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,516
Hello, little prince.

28
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,871
Look. He's trying to get up.

29
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,950
Kinda wobbly, isn't he?

30
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,951
Thumper.

31
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,951
Well, he is.

32
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,432
Aren't you?

33
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,757
Looks to me like
he's getting kind of sleepy.

34
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,150
I think it's time we all left.

35
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,878
Come on.

36
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,279
Thumper. Come on.

37
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,156
Whatcha gonna call him?

38
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,878
Well, I think I'll call him Bambi.

39
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,592
Yep, I guess that'll do all right.

40
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,391
My little Bambi.

41
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,476
Walking already.
Well, what do you know.

42
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,793
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mrs Quail.

43
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,996
And where's the young prince this...

44
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,316
- Good morning, Bambi.
- Good morning, young prince.

45
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,311
Goodbye.

46
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,111
Good morning, young prince.

47
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,317
Good morning, young prince.

48
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,116
Good morning.

49
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,111
Nice sunny day.

50
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,790
- What's the matter?
- What happened?

51
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,474
Did the young prince fall down?

52
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,791
- Is he hurt?
- No, he's all right.

53
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,353
He doesn't walk very good, does he?

54
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,237
Thumper.

55
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,951
Yes, Mama?

56
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,797
What did your father tell you
this morning?

57
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,312
If you can't say something nice,

58
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,472
don't say nothing at all.

59
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,629
Come on, Bambi, get up. Try again.

60
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,280
Come on, get up. Get up.

61
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,511
- Get up.
- Try again.

62
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,399
I'm thumping.
That's why they call me Thumper.

63
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,151
Thumper!

64
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,078
Come on. You can do it.

65
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,878
Hop over it. Like this.

66
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,031
Hop over it.

67
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,231
Like this.

68
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,595
You didn't hop far enough.

69
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,028
That's it. Now the other one.

70
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,157
Gee whiz, what happened that time?

71
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,471
Those are birds.

72
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,596
Look, he's trying to talk.

73
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,871
He's trying to say ''bird''.

74
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,031
Say ''bird''.

75
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,238
Bird.

76
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,357
Bird.

77
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,795
Come on, say ''bird'', say ''bird''.

78
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,713
Say ''bird''. Say ''bird''.
Come on, say ''bird''.

79
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,711
Say ''bird''.

80
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,159
Bird.

81
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,118
He talked. He talked, Mama.

82
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,555
The young prince said ''bird''.

83
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,393
Bird, bird, bird...

84
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,354
Bird.

85
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,476
No, that's not a bird.

86
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,755
That's a butterfly.

87
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,831
Butterfly?

88
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,194
Butter...

89
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,272
Butterfly.

90
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,749
No, that's a flower.

91
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,435
- Flower?
- It's pretty.

92
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,476
Pretty.

93
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,992
Flower.

94
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,513
Me?

95
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,155
That's not a flower.

96
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,800
- He's a little...
- That's all right.

97
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,476
He can call me a flower
if he wants to.

98
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,233
I don't mind.

99
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,155
Pretty. Pretty flower.

100
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,913
Gosh.

101
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,196
I think I better go home now.

Mother, what we going to do today?

135
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,388
I'm going to take you to the meadow.

136
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,958
Meadow? What's the meadow?

137
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,793
It's a very wonderful place.

138
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,633
Then why haven't we been there before?

139
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,188
You weren't big enough.

140
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,874
- Mother, you know what?
- What?

141
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,633
We're not the only deer in the forest.

142
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,917
- Where did you hear that?
- Thumper told me.

143
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,195
Well, he's right.

144
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,840
There are many deer
in the forest besides us.

145
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,559
Then why don't I ever see them?

146
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,313
- You will, sometime.
- On the meadow?

147
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,038
Perhaps.

148
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,076
Hush now.

149
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,151
We're almost there.

150
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,231
- The meadow.
- Wait.

151
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,796
Bambi, wait.

152
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,079
You must never rush out on the meadow.

153
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,071
There might be danger.

154
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,156
Out there, we're unprotected.

155
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,629
The meadow is wide and open,

156
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,393
and there are no trees or bushes
to hide us.

157
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,710
So we have to be very careful.

158
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,592
Wait here.

159
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,594
I'll go out first. And if the meadow
is safe, I'll call you.

160
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,718
Come on, Bambi. It's all right.

161
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,871
Come on.

162
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,551
Good morning, Prince Bambi.

163
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,949
Good morning, young prince.

164
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,679
Hello. What ya eatin'?

165
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,877
- Clover.
- It's awfully good.

166
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,871
It's delicious.

167
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,315
Why don't you try some?

168
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,991
No, not that green stuff.

169
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,836
Just eat the blossoms.

170
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,831
That's the good stuff.

171
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,399
Thumper.

172
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,748
- Yes, Mama?
- What did your father tell you?

173
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,639
About what?

174
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,599
About eating the blossoms
and leaving the greens?

175
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,557
Oh, that one.

176
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,189
Eating greens is a special treat.

177
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,239
It makes long ears
and great big feet.

178
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,314
But it sure is awful stuff to eat.

179
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,318
I made that last part up myself.

180
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,751
Watch out.

181
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,875
That's little Faline.

182
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,713
He's kind of bashful, isn't he, Mama?

183
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,429
Well, maybe he wouldn't be
if you'd say hello.

184
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,437
Hello, Bambi.

185
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,920
I said hello.

186
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,195
Well, aren't you going to answer her?

187
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,310
You're not afraid, are you?

188
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,551
Well, then, go ahead.

189
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,591
Go on, say hello.

190
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,315
Hello.

191
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,071
You.

192
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,995
He stopped and looked at me.

193
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,275
Yes, I know.

194
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,588
Why was everyone still
when he came on the meadow?

195
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,750
Everyone respects him.

196
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:32,472
For of all the deer in the forest,
not one has lived half so long.

197
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,069
He's very brave and very wise.

198
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,234
That's why he's known as
the Great Prince of the Forest.

199
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,073
Faline.

200
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,553
Bambi.

201
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,879
Mother.

202
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,199
Bambi.

203
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,112
Mother.

204
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,751
Come on out, Bambi.

205
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,633
Come on.

206
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,151
It's safe now.

207
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,993
We don't have to hide any longer.

208
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,830
What happened, Mother?
Why did we all run?

209
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,718
Man was in the forest.

210
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,515
Mother, look.
What's all that white stuff?

211
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,029
Why, it's snow.

212
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,588
- Snow?
- Yes.

213
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,591
Winter has come.

214
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,916
Hiya, Bambi.

215
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,675
Watch what I can do.

216
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,319
Come on. It's all right.

217
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,753
Look.

218
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,471
The water's stiff.

219
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,559
Some fun, huh, Bambi?

220
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,953
Come on, get up. Like this.

221
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,599
Kinda wobbly, aren't you?

222
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,390
Got to watch both ends
at the same time.

223
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,910
Guess you better unwind it.

224
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,279
Wake up. Wake up, Flower.

225
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,553
Is it spring yet?

226
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,634
No. Winter's just started.

227
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,954
What you doing? Hibernating?

228
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,755
What do you want to do that for?

229
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,955
All us flowers sleep in the winter.

230
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,473
Well, good night.

231
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,036
Winter sure is long, isn't it?

232
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,031
It seems long.

233
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,194
But it won't last forever.

234
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,516
I'm awful hungry, Mother.

235
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,830
Yes, I know.

236
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,836
Bambi, come here.

237
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,990
Look.

238
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,469
New spring grass.

239
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,678
Bambi. Quick.

240
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,990
The thicket.

241
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,759
Faster. Faster, Bambi.

242
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,196
Don't look back. Keep running.

243
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,316
Keep running.

244
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,831
We made it.

245
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,831
We made it, Mother.

246
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,954
We...

247
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,631
Mother.

248
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,354
Mother, where are you?

249
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,953
Your mother can't be with you anymore.

250
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,636
Come.

251
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,311
My son.

252
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,114
<i>Lets sing a gay little spring song</i>

253
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,553
<i>This is the season to sing</i>

254
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,269

255
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,238

256
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,470

00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,028
<i>Lets get together and sing</i>

258
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,034
<i>Lets sing a gay little spring song</i>

259
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,673
<i>Just like bird on the wing</i>

260
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:22,116
<i>Things always seem right</i>

266
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,556
<i>Forget all your troubles</i>
<i>And warble away...</i>

267
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,551
Wait.

268
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,551
What now?

269
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,870
Hey.

270
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,318
Stop that racket.

271
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,879
Scat.

272
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,154
<i>Lets sing a song about spring</i>

273
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,831
I'll fix 'em.

274
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,997
There. I guess that'll teach 'em.

275
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,908
Oh, what's the use?

276
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,952
<i>This is the season to sing...</i>

277
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,633
Same thing every spring.

278
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,955
Love's sweet song.

279
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,108
Pain in the pin feathers, I call it.

280
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,631
Stop it.

281
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,469
Get out of here. All of you.

282
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,590
And you, too.

283
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,719
Hello, Friend Owl.
Don't you remember me?

284
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,950
Why, it's the young prince.

285
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,632
Bambi!

286
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,550
My, my, how you've changed.

287
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,632
Turn round there.
Let me look at you.

288
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,679
I see you've traded in your spots
for a pair of antlers.

289
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,428
You know, just the other day
I was talking to myself about you.

290
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,273
And we were wondering
what had become of you.

291
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,271
Hello, Bambi.

292
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,476
Remember me?

293
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,189
Thumper.

294
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,673
Right.

295
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,991
Hi, fellas.

296
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,638
Flower.

297
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,112
Yeah.

298
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,993
Well, what's the matter with them?

299
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,355
Why are they acting that way?

300
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,990
Why, don't you know?

301
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,312
They're ''twitterpated''.

302
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,033
Twitterpated?

303
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,240
Yes. Nearly everybody gets twitterpated
in the spring time.

304
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,710
Yes. Nearly everybody gets twitterpated
in the spring time.

305
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,911
For example,

306
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,075
you're walking along,
minding your own business,

307
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,073
you're looking neither to the left
nor to the right,

308
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,071
when all of a sudden

309
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,914
you run smack into a pretty face.

310
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,549
You begin to get weak in the knees.

311
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,631
Your head's in a whirl.

312
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,838
And then you feel light as a feather.

313
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,990
And before you know it,

314
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,674
you're walking on air.

315
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,511
And then you know what?

316
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,989
You're knocked for a loop.

317
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,833
And you completely lose your head.

318
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,077
Gosh, that's awful.

319
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,071
- Gee whiz.
- Terrible.

320
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,991
And that ain't all.

321
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,833
It can happen to anybody.

322
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,160
So you'd better be careful.

323
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,309
It could happen to you, and you, and...

324
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,113
Yes, it could even happen to you.

325
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,114
Well, it's not going to happen to me.

326
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,873
- Me neither.
- Me neither.

327
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,549
Twitterpated.

328
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,831
Hello, Bambi.

329
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,591
Don't you remember me?

330
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,151
I'm Faline.

331
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,319
Bambi.

332
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,919
<i>I bring you a song</i>

333
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:36,593
<i>And I sing as I go</i>

334
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,672
<i>For I want you to know</i>

335
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,117
<i>That Im looking for romance</i>

336
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:48,669
<i>I bring you a song</i>

337
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:52,355
<i>In the hope that youll see</i>

338
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,159
<i>When youre looking at me</i>

339
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:58,391
<i>That Im looking for love</i>

340
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,438
<i>Im seeking that glow</i>

341
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,159
<i>Only found when youre young</i>
<i>and its May</i>

342
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,118
<i>Only found on that wonderful day</i>

343
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,111
<i>When all longing is through</i>

344
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,312
<i>Im seeking that glow</i>

345
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,437
<i>Only found when a thrill is complete</i>

346
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,637
<i>Only found when two hearts gently beat</i>

347
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:29,193
<i>To the strains of a waltz</i>
<i>Thats both tender and new</i>

348
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,556
<i>I bring you a song</i>

349
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,349
<i>For Im seeking romance</i>

350
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,113
<i>Youre by my side</i>
<i>Theres a moon up above</i>

351
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,078
<i>It shines with a light</i>
<i>Thats so mellow and bright</i>

352
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:47,678
<i>Its easy to see</i>
<i>That tonight we shall fall in love</i>

353
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:01,119
<i>I bring you a song</i>

354
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,192
<i>For Im seeking romance</i>

355
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,679
<i>And you</i>

356
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,833
It is Man.

357
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,831
He is here again.

358
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,234
There are many this time.

359
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,830
We must go deep into the forest.

360
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,831
Hurry. Follow me.

361
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,439
Faline.

362
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,311
Bambi, where are you?

363
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,239
Faline.

364
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,393
Listen.

365
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,357
- He's coming.
- Hush.

366
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,271
Be quiet.

367
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:02,193
- He's coming closer.
- Be calm. Don't get excited.

368
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:06,152
- We better fly.
- No. No, don't fly.

369
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,276
Whatever you do, don't fly.

370
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:11,750
He's almost here.
I can't stand it any longer.

371
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,229
Bambi.

372
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:44,915
Faline.

373
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,878
Quick, Faline. Jump.

374
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,391
Get up, Bambi.

375
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,311
Get up.

376
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,351
You must get up.

377
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,557
Get up.

378
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:51,271
Get up.

379
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,759
Now, come with me.

380
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,874
Bambi.

381
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,915
Wake up. Wake up, Friend Owl.

382
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,195
Wake up, Friend Owl.

383
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,317
What now?

384
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,314
Hey, what's going on around here?

385
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,958
- It's happened.
- Happened?

386
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:56,951
Yes. In the thicket.

387
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,917
Hurry up, Bambi.

388
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,231
Yes, Papa. I'm coming.

389
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,310
Oh. Well.

390
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,633
Look.

391
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,279
Two of them.

392
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:55,917
Well, I don't believe I've ever seen
a more likely looking pair of fawns.

393
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,958
Prince Bambi ought to be mighty proud.

394
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:10,515
<i>Love is a song that never ends</i>

395
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:18,395
<i>One simple theme repeating</i>

396
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,956
<i>Like the voice</i>

397
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:28,910
<i>Of a heavenly choir</i>

398
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,959
<i>Loves sweet music</i>

399
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:36,828
<i>Flows on</i>

400
01:06:37,828 --> 01:06:47,828
