00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:18,352
<i>Love is a song that never ends</i>

2
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:23,815
<i>Life may be swift and fleeting</i>

3
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:29,488
<i>Hope may die
Yet love's beautiful music</i>

4
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:35,202
<i>Comes each day like the dawn</i>

5
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:40,916
<i>Love is a song that never ends</i>

6
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:46,630
<i>One simple theme repeating</i>

7
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:52,427
<i>Like the voice of a heavenly choir</i>

8
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:59,393
<i>Love's sweet music flows on</i>

9
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:11,905
<i>Like the voice of a heavenly choir</i>

10
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:18,787
<i>Love's sweet music flows on</i>

11
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,708
Wake up.

12
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:55,212
- What now?
- Wake up, Friend Owl.

13
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,297
What's going on around here?

14
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,633
- Wake up.
- It's happened.

15
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,677
The new prince is born.

16
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,222
- We're going to see him.
- Come on. You better hurry up.

17
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,279
Well, look.

18
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:25,117
- Well.
- Isn't he cute?

19
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:32,541
Well, this is quite an occasion.

20
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:37,462
Yes, sir,
it isn't every day a prince is born.

21
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,300
You're to be congratulated.

22
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:44,761
- Yes, congratulations.
- Congratulations.

23
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,847
Thank you very much.

24
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,602
Come on. Wake up.
We have company.

25
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,151
Hello. Hello, there.

26
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:02,321
- Hello, little prince.
- Hello. Hello, there.

27
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,531
Hello, little prince.

28
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,761
Look. He's trying to get up.

29
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,869
Kinda wobbly, isn't he?

30
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:52,955
Thumper.

31
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,083
Well, he is.

32
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,711
Aren't you?

33
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:10,472
Looks to me like
he's getting kind of sleepy.

34
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,103
I think it's time we all left.

35
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,896
Come on.

36
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,125
Thumper. Come on.

37
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,213
Whatcha gonna call him?

38
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:48,135
Well, I think I'll call him Bambi.

39
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:55,142
Yep, I guess that'll do all right.

40
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,147
My little Bambi.

41
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,597
Walking already.
Well, what do you know.

42
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:52,699
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mrs Quail.

43
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,993
And where's the young prince this...

44
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,583
- Good morning, Bambi.
- Good morning, young prince.

45
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,797
Goodbye.

46
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,802
Good morning, young prince.

47
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,352
Good morning, young prince.

48
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,827
Good morning.

49
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,955
Nice sunny day.

50
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:54,219
- What's the matter?
- What happened?

51
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:57,014
Did the young prince fall down?

52
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:00,475
- Is he hurt?
- No, he's all right.

53
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,230
He doesn't walk very good, does he?

54
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,191
Thumper.

55
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:10,027
Yes, Mama?

56
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:14,031
What did your father tell you
this morning?

57
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,786
If you can't say something nice,

58
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:26,210
don't say nothing at all.

59
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:31,590
Come on, Bambi, get up. Try again.

60
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,343
Come on, get up. Get up.

61
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,678
- Get up.
- Try again.

62
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,005
I'm thumping.
That's why they call me Thumper.

63
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:16,969
Thumper!

64
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:37,739
Come on. You can do it.

65
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,702
Hop over it. Like this.

66
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:44,997
Hop over it.

67
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,419
Like this.

68
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,392
You didn't hop far enough.

69
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:11,064
That's it. Now the other one.

70
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,745
Gee whiz, what happened that time?

71
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:44,890
Those are birds.

72
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,314
Look, he's trying to talk.

73
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,777
He's trying to say "bird".

74
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,114
Say "bird".

75
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,537
Bird.

76
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,918
Bird.

77
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,462
Come on, say "bird", say "bird".

78
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:18,507
Say "bird". Say "bird".
Come on, say "bird".

79
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,592
Say "bird".

80
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,179
Bird.

81
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:29,351
He talked. He talked, Mama.

82
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,895
The young prince said "bird".

83
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:34,857
Bird, bird, bird...

84
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,669
Bird.

85
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,880
No, that's not a bird.

86
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:00,257
That's a butterfly.

87
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,426
Butterfly?

88
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:03,844
Butter...

89
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:10,184
Butterfly.

90
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,769
No, that's a flower.

91
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:16,607
- Flower?
- It's pretty.

92
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,947
Pretty.

93
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:32,831
Flower.

94
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:34,416
Me?

95
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,511
That's not a flower.

96
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:48,263
- He's a little...
- That's all right.

97
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:53,143
He can call me a flower
if he wants to.

98
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,192
I don't mind.

99
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:06,365
Pretty. Pretty flower.

100
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:14,456
Gosh.

101
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:29,346
I think I better go home now.

102
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:28,280

134
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:56,947
Mother, what we going to do today?

135
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,616
I'm going to take you to the meadow.

136
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:03,328
Meadow? What's the meadow?

137
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:06,290
It's a very wonderful place.

138
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:09,251
Then why haven't we been there before?

139
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,920
You weren't big enough.

140
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:14,715
- Mother, you know what?
- What?

141
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,593
We're not the only deer in the forest.

142
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:21,013
- Where did you hear that?
- Thumper told me.

143
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:23,390
Well, he's right.

144
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:26,143
There are many deer
in the forest besides us.

145
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,979
Then why don't I ever see them?

146
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,857
- You will, sometime.
- On the meadow?

147
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,650
Perhaps.

148
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:35,777
Hush now.

149
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:38,989
We're almost there.

150
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,542
- The meadow.
- Wait.

151
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:53,212
Bambi, wait.

152
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:57,674
You must never rush out on the meadow.

153
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:59,760
There might be danger.

154
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,971
Out there, we're unprotected.

155
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:05,557
The meadow is wide and open,

156
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:08,435
and there are no trees or bushes
to hide us.

157
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,854
So we have to be very careful.

158
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:13,857
Wait here.

159
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:20,113
I'll go out first. And if the meadow
is safe, I'll call you.

160
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,459
Come on, Bambi. It's all right.

161
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:20,883
Come on.

162
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:13,727
Good morning, Prince Bambi.

163
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,230
Good morning, young prince.

164
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:19,066
Hello. What ya eatin'?

165
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:22,402
- Clover.
- It's awfully good.

166
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:24,488
It's delicious.

167
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:27,032
Why don't you try some?

168
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:32,955
No, not that green stuff.

169
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:35,916
Just eat the blossoms.

170
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:38,001
That's the good stuff.

171
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:40,671
Thumper.

172
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:46,260
- Yes, Mama?
- What did your father tell you?

173
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:48,220
About what?

174
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:52,349
About eating the blossoms
and leaving the greens?

175
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:54,393
Oh, that one.

176
00:23:56,562 --> 00:24:00,274
Eating greens is a special treat.

177
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:04,486
It makes long ears
and great big feet.

178
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:09,783
But it sure is awful stuff to eat.

179
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:13,954
I made that last part up myself.

180
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:19,626
Watch out.

181
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:25,442
That's little Faline.

182
00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:29,446
He's kind of bashful, isn't he, Mama?

183
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:33,325
Well, maybe he wouldn't be
if you'd say hello.

184
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:38,539
Hello, Bambi.

185
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:45,295
I said hello.

186
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:47,673
Well, aren't you going to answer her?

187
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:53,011
You're not afraid, are you?

188
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,475
Well, then, go ahead.

189
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:06,859
Go on, say hello.

190
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:11,780
Hello.

191
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:52,196
You.

192
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:30,604
He stopped and looked at me.

193
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:32,981
Yes, I know.

194
00:29:33,524 --> 00:29:37,486
Why was everyone still
when he came on the meadow?

195
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:39,738
Everyone respects him.

196
00:29:39,822 --> 00:29:45,702
For of all the deer in the forest,
not one has lived half so long.

197
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:50,499
He's very brave and very wise.

198
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:56,922
That's why he's known as
the Great Prince of the Forest.

199
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:05,574
Faline.

200
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,245
Bambi.

201
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:13,707
Mother.

202
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:18,212
Bambi.

203
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:27,513
Mother.

204
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:09,888
Come on out, Bambi.

205
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:13,934
Come on.

206
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,562
It's safe now.

207
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:19,523
We don't have to hide any longer.

208
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:25,612
What happened, Mother?
Why did we all run?

209
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:33,829
Man was in the forest.

210
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:17,891
Mother, look.
What's all that white stuff?

211
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:21,562
Why, it's snow.

212
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:24,231
- Snow?
- Yes.

213
00:34:24,314 --> 00:34:26,316
Winter has come.

214
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,341
Hiya, Bambi.

215
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:35,219
Watch what I can do.

216
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:53,612
Come on. It's all right.

217
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:55,113
Look.

218
00:35:55,948 --> 00:35:57,950
The water's stiff.

219
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:16,802
Some fun, huh, Bambi?

220
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:22,432
Come on, get up. Like this.

221
00:37:03,098 --> 00:37:05,851
Kinda wobbly, aren't you?

222
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:30,667
Got to watch both ends
at the same time.

223
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,509
Guess you better unwind it.

224
00:38:33,397 --> 00:38:36,233
Wake up. Wake up, Flower.

225
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:42,781
Is it spring yet?

226
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:45,993
No. Winter's just started.

227
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:49,454
What you doing? Hibernating?

228
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:57,588
What do you want to do that for?

229
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:03,010
All us flowers sleep in the winter.

230
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:10,851
Well, good night.

231
00:40:19,962 --> 00:40:23,382
Winter sure is long, isn't it?

232
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:25,467
It seems long.

233
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:28,762
But it won't last forever.

234
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:35,352
I'm awful hungry, Mother.

235
00:40:35,435 --> 00:40:37,771
Yes, I know.

236
00:40:47,197 --> 00:40:49,241
Bambi, come here.

237
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,536
Look.

238
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:55,122
New spring grass.

239
00:41:18,562 --> 00:41:20,355
Bambi. Quick.

240
00:41:20,439 --> 00:41:22,774
The thicket.

241
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,823
Faster. Faster, Bambi.

242
00:41:29,907 --> 00:41:33,410
Don't look back. Keep running.

243
00:41:33,494 --> 00:41:35,621
Keep running.

244
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:49,718
We made it.

245
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:51,803
We made it, Mother.

246
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:54,014
We...

247
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:56,808
Mother.

248
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:11,114
Mother, where are you?

249
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:54,491
Your mother can't be with you anymore.

250
00:43:10,883 --> 00:43:12,926
Come.

251
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:15,721
My son.

252
00:43:37,993 --> 00:43:40,537
<i>Let's sing a gay little spring song</i>

253
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:44,124
<i>This is the season to sing</i>

254
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:48,003
<i>So I'd like to suggest
That we all do our best</i>

255
00:43:48,086 --> 00:43:51,089
<i>And warble a song about spring</i>

256
00:43:51,173 --> 00:43:53,425
<i>Spring, spring, spring</i>

257
00:43:53,509 --> 00:43:56,094
<i>Let's get together and sing</i>

258
00:44:00,682 --> 00:44:03,393
<i>Let's sing a gay little spring song</i>

259
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:07,189
<i>Just like bird on the wing</i>

260
00:44:07,272 --> 00:44:10,776
<i>Things always seem right
When you're cheerful and bright</i>

261
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:13,570
<i>So let's get together and sing</i>

262
00:44:13,654 --> 00:44:16,198
<i>Sing, sing, sing</i>

263
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:19,284
<i>Let's sing a song about spring</i>

264
00:44:19,368 --> 00:44:23,080
<i>Let's twitter and tweet
Like the birdies in May</i>

265
00:44:23,163 --> 00:44:26,500
<i>Get into the mood
And be merry today</i>

266
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:30,003
<i>Forget all your troubles
And warble away...</i>

267
00:44:30,087 --> 00:44:32,089
Wait.

268
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:34,174
What now?

269
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,679
Hey.

270
00:44:39,513 --> 00:44:41,223
Stop that racket.

271
00:44:41,306 --> 00:44:42,850
Scat.

272
00:44:44,685 --> 00:44:47,312
<i>Let's sing a song about spring</i>

273
00:44:48,105 --> 00:44:50,107
I'll fix 'em.

274
00:44:57,197 --> 00:45:01,743
There. I guess that'll teach 'em.

275
00:45:06,373 --> 00:45:08,959
Oh, what's the use?

276
00:45:12,129 --> 00:45:15,257
<i>This is the season to sing...</i>

277
00:45:18,302 --> 00:45:21,180
Same thing every spring.

278
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,898
Love's sweet song.

279
00:45:32,649 --> 00:45:35,235
Pain in the pin feathers, I call it.

280
00:45:55,672 --> 00:45:57,674
Stop it.

281
00:46:00,302 --> 00:46:02,721
Get out of here. All of you.

282
00:46:05,724 --> 00:46:08,060
And you, too.

283
00:46:08,143 --> 00:46:12,356
Hello, Friend Owl.
Don't you remember me?

284
00:46:12,439 --> 00:46:14,691
Why, it's the young prince.

285
00:46:14,775 --> 00:46:16,443
Bambi!

286
00:46:18,195 --> 00:46:20,531
My, my, how you've changed.

287
00:46:20,614 --> 00:46:23,742
Turn round there.
Let me look at you.

288
00:46:23,826 --> 00:46:27,955
I see you've traded in your spots
for a pair of antlers.

289
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:36,046
You know, just the other day
I was talking to myself about you.

290
00:46:36,129 --> 00:46:39,007
And we were wondering
what had become of you.

291
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:41,093
Hello, Bambi.

292
00:46:42,386 --> 00:46:44,429
Remember me?

293
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,223
Thumper.

294
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:48,809
Right.

295
00:46:53,397 --> 00:46:55,399
Hi, fellas.

296
00:46:55,482 --> 00:46:57,109
Flower.

297
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,695
Yeah.

298
00:47:10,247 --> 00:47:13,125
Well, what's the matter with them?

299
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:15,586
Why are they acting that way?

300
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:18,338
Why, don't you know?

301
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:20,757
They're "twitterpated".

302
00:47:22,092 --> 00:47:23,594
Twitterpated?

303
00:47:23,677 --> 00:47:28,473
Yes. Nearly everybody gets twitterpated
in the spring time.

304
00:47:32,936 --> 00:47:34,938
For example,

305
00:47:35,522 --> 00:47:39,276
you're walking along,
minding your own business,

306
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:43,447
you're looking neither to the left
nor to the right,

307
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,532
when all of a sudden

308
00:47:45,616 --> 00:47:49,536
you run smack into a pretty face.

309
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:58,545
You begin to get weak in the knees.

310
00:47:58,629 --> 00:48:00,714
Your head's in a whirl.

311
00:48:02,007 --> 00:48:05,093
And then you feel light as a feather.

312
00:48:05,177 --> 00:48:07,346
And before you know it,

313
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:10,140
you're walking on air.

314
00:48:14,228 --> 00:48:16,230
And then you know what?

315
00:48:16,313 --> 00:48:18,816
You're knocked for a loop.

316
00:48:18,899 --> 00:48:21,777
And you completely lose your head.

317
00:48:24,238 --> 00:48:26,198
Gosh, that's awful.

318
00:48:26,281 --> 00:48:28,283
- Gee whiz.
- Terrible.

319
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:30,285
And that ain't all.

320
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:33,247
It can happen to anybody.

321
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:36,708
So you'd better be careful.

322
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:41,046
It could happen to you, and you, and...

323
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:46,051
Yes, it could even happen to you.

324
00:48:48,554 --> 00:48:51,265
Well, it's not going to happen to me.

325
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:54,142
- Me neither.
- Me neither.

326
00:50:43,126 --> 00:50:44,336
Twitterpated.

327
00:52:34,196 --> 00:52:36,198
Hello, Bambi.

328
00:52:38,116 --> 00:52:40,118
Don't you remember me?

329
00:52:44,957 --> 00:52:46,959
I'm Faline.

330
00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:54,902
Bambi.

331
00:55:46,346 --> 00:55:49,183
<i>I bring you a song</i>

332
00:55:49,975 --> 00:55:54,062
<i>And I sing as I go</i>

333
00:55:54,146 --> 00:55:57,274
<i>For I want you to know</i>

334
00:55:57,357 --> 00:56:01,904
<i>That I'm looking for romance</i>

335
00:56:02,946 --> 00:56:06,658
<i>I bring you a song</i>

336
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:10,496
<i>In the hope that you'll see</i>

337
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:13,415
<i>When you're looking at me</i>

338
00:56:13,499 --> 00:56:16,793
<i>That I'm looking for love</i>

339
00:56:18,962 --> 00:56:22,049
<i>I'm seeking that glow</i>

340
00:56:22,132 --> 00:56:24,885
<i>Only found when you're young
and it's May</i>

341
00:56:24,968 --> 00:56:27,971
<i>Only found on that wonderful day</i>

342
00:56:28,055 --> 00:56:30,057
<i>When all longing is through</i>

343
00:56:32,434 --> 00:56:35,479
<i>I'm seeking that glow</i>

344
00:56:35,562 --> 00:56:38,732
<i>Only found when a thrill is complete</i>

345
00:56:38,816 --> 00:56:42,069
<i>Only found when two hearts gently beat</i>

346
00:56:42,152 --> 00:56:48,909
<i>To the strains of a waltz
That's both tender and new</i>

347
00:56:48,992 --> 00:56:52,412
<i>I bring you a song</i>

348
00:56:52,496 --> 00:56:56,375
<i>For I'm seeking romance</i>

349
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:59,253
<i>You're by my side
There's a moon up above</i>

350
00:56:59,336 --> 00:57:02,339
<i>It shines with a light
That's so mellow and bright</i>

351
00:57:02,422 --> 00:57:08,178
<i>It's easy to see
That tonight we shall fall in love</i>

352
00:57:18,063 --> 00:57:22,192
<i>I bring you a song</i>

353
00:57:22,276 --> 00:57:25,404
<i>For I'm seeking romance</i>

354
00:57:26,196 --> 00:57:29,032
<i>And you</i>

355
00:58:43,565 --> 00:58:46,360
It is Man.

356
00:58:46,443 --> 00:58:48,445
He is here again.

357
00:58:50,405 --> 00:58:53,033
There are many this time.

358
00:58:55,577 --> 00:58:57,830
We must go deep into the forest.

359
00:58:57,913 --> 00:58:59,915
Hurry. Follow me.

360
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:03,669
Faline.

361
00:59:20,227 --> 00:59:22,312
Bambi, where are you?

362
00:59:37,536 --> 00:59:38,912
Faline.

363
01:00:20,245 --> 01:00:21,830
Listen.

364
01:00:21,914 --> 01:00:23,874
- He's coming.
- Hush.

365
01:00:23,957 --> 01:00:25,876
Be quiet.

366
01:00:26,835 --> 01:00:31,006
- He's coming closer.
- Be calm. Don't get excited.

367
01:00:31,924 --> 01:00:35,135
- We better fly.
- No. No, don't fly.

368
01:00:35,219 --> 01:00:37,346
Whatever you do, don't fly.

369
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:40,974
He's almost here.
I can't stand it any longer.

370
01:00:56,782 --> 01:00:59,201
Bambi.

371
01:01:14,383 --> 01:01:15,551
Faline.

372
01:02:31,919 --> 01:02:33,712
Quick, Faline. Jump.

373
01:04:07,139 --> 01:04:09,141
Get up, Bambi.

374
01:04:13,312 --> 01:04:15,314
Get up.

375
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:21,612
You must get up.

376
01:04:25,073 --> 01:04:27,034
Get up.

377
01:04:27,868 --> 01:04:29,870
Get up.

378
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:36,627
Now, come with me.

379
01:06:44,713 --> 01:06:46,048
Bambi.

380
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:29,883
Wake up. Wake up, Friend Owl.

381
01:07:29,967 --> 01:07:32,261
Wake up, Friend Owl.

382
01:07:33,554 --> 01:07:35,514
What now?

383
01:07:36,974 --> 01:07:39,685
Hey, what's going on around here?

384
01:07:39,768 --> 01:07:41,395
- It's happened.
- Happened?

385
01:07:41,478 --> 01:07:43,480
Yes. In the thicket.

386
01:07:43,564 --> 01:07:45,524
Hurry up, Bambi.

387
01:07:45,607 --> 01:07:48,986
Yes, Papa. I'm coming.

388
01:08:17,931 --> 01:08:21,393
Oh. Well.

389
01:08:27,524 --> 01:08:29,026
Look.

390
01:08:30,235 --> 01:08:31,778
Two of them.

391
01:08:38,952 --> 01:08:44,958
Well, I don't believe I've ever seen
a more likely looking pair of fawns.

392
01:08:45,042 --> 01:08:48,128
Prince Bambi ought to be mighty proud.

393
01:08:52,382 --> 01:09:00,182
<i>Love is a song that never ends</i>

394
01:09:00,766 --> 01:09:08,398
<i>One simple theme repeating</i>

395
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:13,153
<i>Like the voice</i>

396
01:09:13,237 --> 01:09:19,368
<i>Of a heavenly choir</i>

397
01:09:19,451 --> 01:09:23,580
<i>Love's sweet music</i>

398
01:09:23,664 --> 01:09:27,626
<i>Flows on</i>
