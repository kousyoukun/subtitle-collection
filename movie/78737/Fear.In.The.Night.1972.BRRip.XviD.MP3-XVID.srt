1
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,346
安静 请大家安静
<i>Quiet, please. Everybody, quiet.</i>

2
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:00,059
我们现在唱开学歌
<i>We will now sing
the beginning of term hymn,</i>

3
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:04,643
主 带着祝福接纳我们再次在此集合
<i>"lord, receive us with thy blessing,
once again assembled here."</i>

4
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:37,133
我真的不再需要找你治疗了 不是吗
I don't really need you any more, do I?

5
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,761
对不起我之前没告诉你
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before.

6
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:43,723
我仅仅是怕 真的 你可能不同意
It's just I was afraid, really,
you might not approve.

7
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:47,519
我决心已定 我做的是我想做的
I'd made up my mind
that was what I wanted to do.

8
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,438
- 你什么时候结的婚？- 上周
- When did you get married?
- Last week.

9
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:54,234
此刻他不在 我们甚至还没有过蜜月
He's away at the moment.
We haven't even had our honeymoon yet.

10
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,777
婚礼后那天他不得不动身
He had to leave the day after the wedding.

11
00:03:56,862 --> 00:04:00,532
跟我讲讲他 他干什么的？
Tell me about him. What does he do?

12
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:04,785
他是小学老师 在乡下工作
He's a schoolteacher.
He works in the country.

13
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,372
所以我只好离开比密西太太了
So I'll have to leave mrs beamish.

14
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,208
你很快会找到别的人的 比密西太太
You'll soon find
someone else, mrs beamish.

15
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,419
啊 但不像你这样
Ah, but not like you, dear.

16
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:16,631
安静的像老鼠 总是让地方一尘不染
Quiet as a mouse. The place always spotless.

17
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,968
如今你这样的青年不多了
There aren't many around
like you these days.

18
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:24,593
老是聚会 随时突如其来狐朋狗友们
It's all parties,
friends popping in at all hours.

19
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:29,352
- 你从不像那样 - 对 我不像
- You were never like that.
- No, I wasn't.

20
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:33,936
我觉得他们非常幸运得到了你 我是指学校
I think they're very lucky to be getting you.
The school, I mean.

21
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:38,816
想想看 生活在一大堆快乐小鲜肉中间
Think of it, living among
all those happy little boys.

22
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,573
你会儿子满堂
Quite a family you'll have.

23
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,034
一百五十个
A hundred and fifty of them.

24
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:49,618
- 你会是贤良师母 - 我希望如此
- You'll make a fine wife for a teacher.
- I hope so.

25
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,000
罗伯特先生会来接你吗？
Is mr Robert coming to collect you?

26
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:56,170
- 是的 他早上开车过来 - 啊 那就好
- Yes, he's driving up in the morning.
- Ah. That'll be nice.

27
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,131
你会有美妙蜜月了 不是吗？
It'll be a sort of honeymoon for you, won't it?

28
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:02,969
对 至少我们有假期可盼
Yeah. At least we've got
the holidays to look forward to.

29
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,429
- 你会住在学校？ - 我想是的
- Will you be living near the school?
- I think so.

30
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,557
罗伯特说校内有我们住的小屋
Robert says
we've got a cottage on the grounds.

31
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,767
哦 那就好
Oh. That's nice.

32
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,812
听起来校长伉俪他们人挺好的
They sound very nice,
the headmaster and his wife.

33
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,273
是的 但我还没接触他们
They do. I haven't met them yet.

34
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,650
有的是时间
Plenty of time for that.

35
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:24,490
那么早上你出发前再见
I'll see you in the morning
before you go, then.

36
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,616
再见 亲爱的
Goodbye, dear.

37
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,203
- 晚安 - 晚安好梦
- Night-night.
- Good night and pleasant dreams.

38
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,122
喂 罗伯特
Hello, Robert.

39
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,041
你在哪？
Where are you?

40
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,002
当然在学校 你以为我在哪？
The school, of course.
Where did you think I'd be?

41
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,129
我们刚开完了期末聚餐
We've just had the end of term feast.

42
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:24,258
一百五十个小饕餮吃饱了犯困
A hundred and fifty of the little monsters
stuffing themselves into insensibility.

43
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,635
现在他们一窝蜂到床上去了
Now they've all gone to bed with the wind.

44
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,223
你真该在场 就像猪抢潲水
You should have been here.
Like pigs at a swill.

45
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:34,019
哦 迈克尔和茉莉送爱心 他们盼着见到你
Oh, Michael and Molly send their love,
they're longing to meet you.

46
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,937
你一个人？
Are you alone?

47
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,272
对 比密西太太刚走
Yes, mrs beamish has just gone.

48
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,194
我也爱你
I love you, too.

49
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,322
好 我上午十一点左右见你
Okay, I'll see you about 11:00 in the morning.

50
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,341
你感觉怎样？
How do you feel?

51
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:54,515
休息 年轻女士 你头上有个大包
Relax, young lady.
You got a nasty bump on the head.

52
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,273
- 你们抓住他了吗？ - 抓谁？
- Did you catch him?
- Catch who?

53
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,400
他之前在浴室 他等着我
He was in the bathroom.
He was waiting for me.

54
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,486
没人 亲爱的
There was no one here, dear.

55
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:11,111
我听见地板砰然一响 我就上楼看你的情况
I heard this thump on the floor.
I came upstairs to see if you were all right.

56
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,618
我发现你瘫在浴室地上
And I found you
stretched out on the bathroom floor.

57
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,245
他想勒死我
He tried to strangle me.

58
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,123
我们最好报警
We'd better ring the police.

59
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,375
我可以跟你说句话吗 医生？
Could I have a word with you, doctor?

60
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,283
你现在感觉如何？
How do you feel now?

61
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,204
你们报警了吗？
Have you called the police?

62
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,415
稍后
Later.

63
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,375
比密西太太告诉我你最近状况不太好
Mrs beamish tells me
you haven't been very well lately.

64
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,670
我不明白
I don't understand.

65
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,672
你得了精神崩溃
You had a nervous breakdown.

66
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,593
那是六个月前的事
That was about six months ago.

67
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,388
时隔不久
That's not very long.

68
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,348
那种事要很久才能治好
These things take a long time to sort out.

69
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,893
非常久
A very long time.

70
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,229
我不是凭空想象
I didn't just imagine that.

71
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,481
告诉我出了什么事 原原本本
Tell me what happened, from the beginning.

72
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,696
在你离开后 罗伯特打电话
It was after you went. Robert phoned.

73
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,907
在我跟他通话后
And after I had spoken to him,

74
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,659
我去拴上门链 然后...
I went and put the chain on the door,
and then...

75
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:40,246
门链没拴 亲爱的 我自己进来的
The chain wasn't on, dear. I let myself in.

76
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,873
我用万能钥匙
I used my pass key.

77
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,250
门链没拴
The chain wasn't on.

78
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,129
那他一定是从门出去的
He must have gone out that way, then.

79
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,176
我去报警 如果你们不去
I'll call the police if you're not going to.

80
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,387
不 我们去
No. We'll do it.

81
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,983
你觉得我要多久真正好转？
How long do you think it'll be
before I'm really better?

82
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,569
你现在大有好转
You're much better now.

83
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:15,865
我住院的时候 有个叫吉丽安的姑娘
When I was in the hospital,
there was a girl called Gillian.

84
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,490
你记得她吗？我过去跟她同病房
Do you remember her?
I used to share a room with her.

85
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:25,412
她老是想象有人跟着她监视她
She kept imagining that there was
someone following her and watching her.

86
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,920
当然我们知道不存在 但她真的相信有
Of course, we knew there wasn't,
but she really believed there was.

87
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,091
她也得了精神崩溃
She'd had a breakdown, too,

88
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,178
但我觉得她的病一定比我严重得多
but I think hers must have
been much worse than mine.

89
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,806
那是她二进宫了
That was the second time she'd been back.

90
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,602
她本以为她真的好转了
She thought she was really better.

91
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:48,731
他们一定也以为 不然不会让她出院 不是吗？
They must have thought she was, too,
or they wouldn't have let her go, would they?

92
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,651
但在之后
But it was afterwards, though,

93
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:56,234
她离开后 她独自一人的时候 她开始想象
when she'd left, when she was on her own,
that she started imagining those things.

94
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,278
你确定你感觉没事了？
Are you sure
you're feeling all right?

95
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,197
嗯
Mmm.

96
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,658
- 对不起 - 没关系
-L'm sorry.
-Lt's okay.

97
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,662
对不起
I am sorry.

98
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,665
我本来对此旅很是期待
I was looking forward
to the drive and everything.

99
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:51,043
现在毁了？
And now it's spoiled?

100
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,672
- 不 不是毁了 只是... - 什么？
- No. It's not spoiled, it's just...
- What?

101
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,841
我不知道
I don't know.

102
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,222
这种事要花时间愈合
These things take time to mend.

103
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,766
你等着瞧 一旦警察抓住他
You'll see, once they catch him.

104
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:10,392
- 警察会抓住他 对吧？ - 当然会 你现在安全了
- They will catch him, won't they?
- Of course they will. You're safe now.

105
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,837
对不起 我心不在焉
I'm sorry. I was miles away.

106
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,340
- 你想什么？ - 我在想
- Where were you?
- I was thinking,

107
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,467
因为你 我会成为男学生数不尽的笑料
because of you, I'm gonna be
the butt of countless schoolboy jokes.

108
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,594
- 为什么？ - 因为他们会爱你
- Why?
-'Cause they'll fancy you.

109
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,389
至少大男孩会
At least the older ones will.

110
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,016
“老海勒找了个妙媳妇 你们应该瞅瞅”
"Old Heller's found himself a smashing bird,
you should see her."

111
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,061
然后他们会编粗俗的黄段子你和我妖精打架
And they'll make up wildly erotic stories
about what you and I get up to.

112
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,568
我会邀请好看的来喝茶
I shall invite
the attractive ones over for tea.

113
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,779
- 好看的什么？ - 男孩子
- Attractive what?
- Boys.

114
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,738
一个也没有
There aren't any.

115
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:06,035
我会倾听他们的烦恼 我会告诉他们洗耳朵背后
I shall listen to all their problems.
I'll tell them to wash behind their ears,

116
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,038
我会告诉他们要对你特别好
and I'll tell them to be especially nice to you.

117
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,457
那就祖坟冒烟了
That'll go down a bomb.

118
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:15,503
- 我知道我会爱它的 - 小泼猴们
- I know I'm gonna love it.
- Monstrous little brutes.

119
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:19,089
我们的小屋要在开学第一天划为禁区
Our cottage will be placed out of bounds
on the first day of term.

120
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,636
- 哦 我等不及要见它了 - 我希望你喜欢它
- Oh, I can't wait to see it.
- I hope you like it.

121
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,266
我肯定我会的 在学校里吗？
I'm sure I will. Ls it near the school?

122
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,112
- 它什么样？ - 什么什么样？
- What's it like?
- What's what like?

123
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,487
- 学校 - 大
- The school.
- Big.

124
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,782
- 还有呢？ - 大
- And?
- Big.

125
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,995
- 它古老吗？ - 其实一点不老 只是样子老
-ls it old?
-Lt's not old at all, actually, it just looks old.

126
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,205
老气横秋
Old and decrepit.

127
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:54,417
其实60年前才建的
It was only built about 60 years ago,
as a matter of fact.

128
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,628
通常称之为证券经纪都铎王朝
Stockbroker tudor, they used to call it.

129
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,381
近来没怎么修缮

00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,631
你一定是海勒太太 罗伯特的妻子
You must be mrs Heller, Robert's wife.

260
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:58,218
容我自我介绍 我是校长
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm the headmaster.

261
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,512
- 迈克尔·卡米克尔 - 你好
- Michael Carmichael.
- How do you do?

262
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,140
- 我猜想你... - 你一定觉得...
- I expect you...
- You must think...

263
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,016
- 我很抱歉 - 不 亲爱的
- I'm sorry.
- No, my dear.

264
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,935
你想说什么？
What were you going to say?

265
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,480
你一定觉得我非常无礼 我不是故意这样进来的
You must think me very rude.
I didn't mean to come in like that.

266
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,566
我没意识到你在工作
I didn't realise you were working.

267
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,695
我从未想过这是工作
I've never thought of it as work.

268
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:20,573
对我来说 教育是永远的嗜好
To me, teaching has always
been a sort of hobby.

269
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:25,199
我喜欢 你明白吗？我喜欢看见我的孩子们赢在起跑线
I like it. Do you see?
I like to see my boys get a good start in life.

270
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,500
他们不得不苦学 可怜孩子们
They have to work, poor chaps.

271
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,670
我们的职责就是教他们怎样学习
Ourjob is really to teach them how to learn.

272
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:38,090
你知道吗 最困难的部分是让他们想学
Do you know that is the most difficult part,
to make them want to learn?

273
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,516
你已经看了学校哪些地方？
How much of the school have you seen?

274
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,143
哦
Oh.

275
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:52,727
我已经看了主厅和餐厅 还有一间宿舍
I've seen the main hall and the dining room,
and one of the dormitories.

276
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:57,068
罗伯特说只要我不碰任何东西就没关系
Robert said it would be all right
as long as I didn't touch anything.

277
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,157
是吗？
Did he?

278
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,410
那你必须再看几个地方
Then you must see some more.

279
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,417
请
Please.

280
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:25,054
- 你认识罗伯特多久了？ - 大约四个月
- And how long have you known Robert?
- Oh, about four months.

281
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,224
闪婚
A quick courtship.

282
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:32,520
- 你们怎么相识的？ - 通过朋友介绍
- How did you meet?
- Oh, just through friends.

283
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:36,983
愿所有红绳如此易牵
Would that all of life's associations
were so simply forged.

284
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:39,903
我们非常高兴有你陪伴我们
We're very pleased to have you with us.

285
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:44,324
你好漂亮 你给我枯木逢春的力量
You're so pretty.
You've already done me a power of good.

286
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:47,452
非常欢迎你加入我们的大家庭
You are a most welcome
addition to our large family.

287
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:51,206
孩子们会倾倒 非常倾倒
The boys will be impressed,
mightily impressed.

288
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:55,002
啊 这是他们的更衣室
Ah. This is their locker room.

289
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,711
一切如此干净整洁
Everything's so clean and tidy.

290
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,255
我估计孩子们来后会非常不同
I expect it's very different
when the boys are here.

291
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:03,468
当然 今天的学业标准和既往一样
Of course, the academic standards of today
are much the same as they've always been.

292
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:06,846
但如今竞争非常激烈
But there is a very much
higher degree of competition these days.

293
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:11,351
越来越多孩子争取上最好的中学和大学
More boys trying for places
in the best schools and universities.

294
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:15,939
哦 哎呀 你一定觉得我是非常无趣的人
Oh, dear me, you must think me
a very dry old stick.

295
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:22,191
他们叫我老花镜 当然在我背后
The call me old gig lamps,
behind my back, of course.

296
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,323
来 我带你看看体育馆
Come, I must show you the gymnasium.

297
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,162
到了
Here it is.

298
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:35,746
我们有普通的双杠 各式鞍马
Now, we have the usual parallel bars,
various vaulting horses,

299
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,670
那是我们每年举行学校演出的地方
and that is where we hold
the annual school play.

300
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,636
我总是对绳结有着非常特别的兴趣
But I've always taken
a very special interest in knots.

301
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,222
我发现不仅是极好的心理疗法
I find them not only excellent therapy,

302
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:53,806
还极有益于学习中性格形成
but most rewarding
in the study of character formation.

303
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,647
你喜欢给东西打结吗？海勒太太？
Do you like tying knots in things, mrs Heller?

304
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:00,817
我不知道 我真的从没试过
I don't know. I've never really tried.

305
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:04,321
有人告诉你吗 你有着最美的头发？
Did anyone ever tell you
you have the most beautiful hair?

306
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,616
哦
Oh.

307
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:12,203
不 我不认为
No, I don't think so.

308
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:16,082
- 我从来不知道怎么打理 - 现在就很迷人
- I never know what to do with it.
- It looks charming as it is.

309
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,168
但也许...
But perhaps...

310
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:23,297
如果你去掉头巾 让秀发自然垂下
If you removed the scarf, let it hang free.

311
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,717
哦 那会看起来很乱
Oh, it would look a mess.

312
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:29,887
- 要洗头 - 我不觉得
- It needs washing.
- Oh, I don't think so.

313
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:33,766
- 好吗？ - 什么 现在？
- Will you?
- What now?

314
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,269
给老朽赏个脸？
As a favour to an old man?

315
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,438
哦
Oh...

316
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,945
请让我来
Please, allow me.

317
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,713
哦！
Ooh!

318
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,258
你的头巾结勒住了
Caught in the knot of your scarf.

319
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,469
哦！
Ooh!

320
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,555
- 我很抱歉 - 没关系
-L'm so sorry.
-Lt's all right.

321
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,640
就要好了
Nearly done.

322
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:19,391
在我遇到你之前 我觉得听到上课的声音
Before I met you
i thought I heard a class going on.

323
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,274
好像在上拉丁课
Sounded like a Latin class.

324
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:28,859
孩子们看来乐在其中 他们一定喜欢学习
They seemed to be enjoying it.
They must like their work.

325
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,782
欢声笑语
All that laughter.

326
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,910
男孩永远是男孩
Boys will be boys.

327
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:38,832
你保留上课录音做研究？
Do you keep recordings
of the classes to study?

328
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:46,089
住在这房子里一定很神奇
This must be a wonderful house to live in.

329
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:50,673
你有时难道不希望它不是学校而是自己所有吗？
Don't you sometimes wish that it wasn't
a school and you had it to yourselves?

330
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,220
哦
Ooh.

331
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,728
- 好了 - 谢谢
- Finished.
- Thank you.

332
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,861
现在我必须离开你了
Now, I must leave you.

333
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,781
我们要参加明天在伦敦的会议
We have a conference to attend
tomorrow in London.

334
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:15,577
恐怕我不得不暂时带走你的罗伯特
I'm afraid I shall have to take your Robert
away from you for a short time.

335
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,663
只有在假期我们能参加
It is only during the school holidays
that we are able to attend

336
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:23,247
众多业余活动 弥补校长的人际关系
the numerous extracurricular activities
that make up a schoolmaster's lot.

337
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:28,381
你已经见过我们陈列的奖杯
You have seen our display of cups.

338
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:32,965
没有？实际上它们令我尤其骄傲
No? Ah. They are something
I'm particularly proud of, as a matter of fact.

339
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,931
我总是信奉用奖杯奖励体育才能
I've always believed in the awarding
of trophies for athletic prowess.

340
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:41,515
催人奋进 打入竞技体育界
It stimulates effort,
puts the keen edge into competitive sport.

341
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,520
我们曾经有个孩子 许多年前
We had a boy here once,
many years ago now,

342
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,944
他一年赢了六个奖杯
he won six cups in one year.

343
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:54,073
几乎囊括 好孩子
Practically a clean sweep, a fine boy.

344
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:06,294
非常感谢你领我参观
Thank you very much
for showing me around.

345
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:09,255
罗伯特说今晚我们跟你们共进晚餐
Robert says we're having
dinner with you tonight.

346
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,758
那么再见
See you then. Goodbye.

347
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,919
鲍勃 是你吗？
Bob, is that you?

348
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:27,500
鲍勃 是他 我又被那个人袭击了
Bob, it was him.
I was attacked by the same man.

349
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,837
- 不可能又是 佩姬 - 鲍勃
- It couldn't happen again, peg.
- Bob...

350
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:34,632
是的！他一定跟着我来了
But it was! He must have followed me here.

351
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:39,595
- 为什么？ - 我怎么知道
- Why?
- I don't know why.

352
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,098
你难道没有看见他？
Didn't you see him?

353
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:44,267
我什么人也没看见 佩姬
I didn't see anyone, peg.

354
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:46,770
我进来发现你瘫在起居室地板上
I came in and found you stretched out
on the living room floor.

355
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,438
他就在那里袭击我 鲍勃
That was where he attacked me, Bob.

356
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:53,776
我以为从学校看见你 我就来找你
I thought I saw you from the house
and I came over to find you.

357
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,363
他等着我 鲍勃 就像之前一样
He was waiting for me, Bob,
like he was before.

358
00:35:57,447 --> 00:36:01,701
- 我去找医生 - 不 报警
<i>-L'll</i> fetch the doctor.
- No. Call the police.

359
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:04,370
- 哦 佩姬 理智 - 拜托 鲍勃 拜托报警
- Oh. Peg, be reasonable.
- Please, Bob, please. Call the police.

360
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:07,248
我没病 拜托
I'm all right, please.

361
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,921
鲍勃 我被袭击了！
Bob, I was attacked!

362
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,465
鲍勃 我被袭击了 真的
Bob, I was attacked. I was.

363
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:24,098
你不相信我 对不对？
You don't believe me, do you?

364
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:29,729
我相信你以为自己被袭击了
I believe you think you were attacked.

365
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:33,900
我觉得事情真相是你不是晕倒就是摔倒了
What I really think happened is that
you either fainted or fell...

366
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,985
你的想象脑补了其余的
Your imagination did the rest.

367
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,322
我的想象
My imagination.

368
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:46,079
上周二我出去吃晚餐
Last Tuesday I went out to dinner.

369
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:50,040
跟比密西太太的一个朋友
It was with a friend of mrs beamish's.

370
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:54,546
我猜她觉得我单身 她要这个男人约我出去的
I supposed she thought I was lonely
so she asked this man to take me out.

371
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:59,342
我们出去吃东西
We went out to have something to eat...

372
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,513
我不知道为什么 但我觉得他在我饮料里下了药
I don't know why,
but I thought he put something in my drink.

373
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,144
我猜我情绪失控
I suppose I lost control.

374
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:17,777
他只好打电话给比密西太太 要她来接我
He had to phone mrs beamish
and ask her to come and get me.

375
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:20,780
她一直试图让我相信
And she kept trying to convince me that

376
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:25,118
他是她的朋友 他不会做那种事
he was a friend of hers
and he wouldn't do anything like that, but...

377
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:30,290
但我不相信她
I didn't believe her.

378
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,084
恐怕我不喜欢他
I'm afraid I didn't like him.

379
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:37,505
他老是说这一定是我的想象
He kept saying it must have been
my imagination.

380
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,591
不可能是我的想象
It couldn't have been my imagination.

381
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:48,266
- 可能吗？ - 对
- Could it?
- Yeah.

382
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,852
我告诉你 到明天再说
I'll tell you what, sleep on it.

383
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:55,439
如果早上你还是这感觉 我们就报警
If you feel the same way in the morning,
then we'll call the police.

384
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,944
现在试着休息
Now, try and get some rest.

385
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:04,615
我会打电话告诉卡米克尔夫妇你不舒服
I'll call the carmichaels
and tell them you're not well.

386
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,303
- 还想要咖啡吗？ - 嗯
- Want some more coffee?
- Mmm.

387
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:43,233
怎么办？我们报不报警？
What's it to be?
Do we call the police or don't we?

388
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,534
你不想要我报警 对吧？
You don't want me to, do you?

389
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:51,037
我想做对你最有好处的事
I want to do what's best for you.

390
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,620
不 你不是的 你以为我在自欺欺人 是不是？
No, you don't. You think I might
make a fool of myself, don't you?

391
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,836
不 我不是
No, I don't.

392
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,342
告诉我一件事
Tell me one thing.

393
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:08,925
在冷静的晨曦中 你还是要说你被袭击了吗？
Now, in the cold light of morning,
do you still say you were attacked?

394
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,682
我被袭击了 真的
I was attacked, I was.

395
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:18,560
一定还是那个人 不是吗？
It must have been the same man, mustn't it?

396
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,026
我会报警
I'll call them.

397
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,114
我会遭遇什么？
What's happening to me?

398
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:32,286
没事的
Nothing.

399
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,515
你想要我报警吗？
Do you want me to call them?

400
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,486
你今天想跟我出去吗？
Do you want to come outwith me today?

401
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,114
我有点工作要做 你不会无聊吧？
I've got some work to do.
You won't be bored?

402
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,202
上楼换好衣服吧
Go upstairs and get dressed. Hmm?

403
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,123
你想喝咖啡吗？
Do you want your coffee?

404
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:24,714
你知道今下午我得去伦敦吗？
You realise I've got to go to London
this afternoon?

405
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,591
知道 卡米克尔先生告诉我了
Yes, mr Carmichael told me.

406
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,968
迈克尔？
Michael?

407
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:33,681
对 昨天我遇见他 他带我参观学校
Yes, I met him yesterday.
He showed me around the school.

408
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,850
你没有告诉我
You didn't tell me.

409
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,021
上去吧
Go on, up you

410
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,415
- 你办完了？- 这里办完了
- have you finished?
- Finished here.

411
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:01,501
- 现在要去那边树林 - 哦
- Got to go over to the woods now.
- Oh.

412
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,794
我可以先送你回家 要是你想
I could drop you off at home first, if you like.

413
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,046
不 没事 我都来这么远了
No, it's all right. I've come this far.

414
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,132
上车
Jump in.

415
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,396
吉姆说部分边篱倒塌了
Jim says part of the boundary fence
has collapsed.

416
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,482
- 你冷吗？- 有点
- You cold?
- Yes, I am a bit.

417
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,734
披上
Hang on. Here.

418
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:31,280
- 鲍勃 是你的？- 不 迈克尔的
- Bob, is that yours?
- Hmm? No, it's Michael's.

419
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:34,283
就像这路虎 实情是这里一切都属于迈克尔
Like the Land Rover. Let's face it,
everything around here belongs to Michael.

420
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:36,911
- 有子弹吗？- 当然有
- Is it loaded?
- Of course it is.

421
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:41,082
- 他用来干什么？- 打兔子狐狸 你懂的
- What does he use it for?
- Rabbits, foxes, you know.

422
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,130
我讨厌枪
I hate guns.

423
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,961
真美 全都是他的？
It's beautiful. Does he own all this?

424
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:30,048
总共一千两百英亩 我不会很久
Twelve hundred acres in all. I won't be long.

425
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:27,230
你到底在这干什么？
What the hell are you doing here?

426
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,160
你这样偷偷摸摸可能被打爆头
You could get your head blown off
creeping around like that.

427
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:44,288
你不知道这是私人产业吗？
Don't you know this is private property?

428
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:48,751
嗯？
Well?

429
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:51,963
我说这是私人产业 你没看见标志牌吗？
I said this is private property.
Didn't you see the signs?

430
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,923
我们设置足够多标志牌了
God knows we put enough of them up.

431
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,009
我没有看见 我很抱歉
No, I didn't. I'm sorry.

432
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:59,178
那么我建议
Well, then I suggest that...

433
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:05,601
- 你好 罗伯特 - 我看你们俩认识了
- Oh. Hello, Robert.
- I see you two have met then.

434
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:11,232
- 这就是新娘？ - 对 这是佩姬
- Oh. Ls this the bride?
- Yes, this is Peggy.

435
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,358
佩姬 这是茉莉·卡米克尔 这是我妻子佩姬
Peggy. Molly Carmichael. Peggy, my wife.

436
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,153
为什么你不早说？
Why didn't you say so, my dear?

437
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:18,656
我几乎让你当鳏夫了 罗伯特
I nearly made a widower out of you, Robert.

438
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,408
- 你什么意思？- 我之前不知道她在
- How do you mean?
- I didn't know she was there.

439
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,494
差几码就...
Another couple of yards, and...

440
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:28,082
亲爱的 你必须更小心
Darling, you must be more careful.

441
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:33,416
是我的错 真的 我以为附近没人 我很抱歉
It was my fault, really. I just assumed
there was nobody around. I'm sorry.

442
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:39,051
你真漂亮
How very pretty you are.

443
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:42,179
- 你捡到宝了 罗伯特 - 对
- You did well for yourself, Robert.
- Yes, I did.

444
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,183
昨晚的事我很抱歉
About last night, I'm very sorry,

445
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:50,187
- 就在最后一刻... - 头痛
-it was just at the last minute...
- A headache.

446
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:52,690
她在学校第一天操劳过度
Trying to do too much
on her first day at school.

447
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:55,442
你必须多照顾她 罗伯特
You must take better care of her, Robert.

448
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,903
我肯定他完全不知道做好丈夫
I'm sure he hasn't the remotest idea of
how to be a good husband.

449
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,865
我一直以为他注定孤独一生
I've always thought of him
as the perennial bachelor.

450
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:07,162
顺便说 罗伯特 迈克尔想要你自个下午去伦敦
Oh. By the way, Robert, Michael wants you to
go up to London by yourself this afternoon.

451
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:11,500
- 但开会怎么办？- 我看他想要你代表他
- But the conference?
- I think he wants you to represent him.

452
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:16,005
好吧 只要他给我稿子 告诉我说什么
All right, as long as he gives me his report
and tells me what to say.

453
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,882
哦 你要赶快来跟我们喝茶
Oh. You must come
and have tea with us soon.

454
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,009
一旦我收拾好小屋
As soon as I get the cottage sorted out.

455
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:24,096
哦 谢谢 我乐意
Oh. Thank you, I'd like that.

456
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,808
你待会去学校吗？我肯定迈克尔有话想跟你说
Will you drop by the house later on then?
I'm sure Michael would like to talk to you.

457
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:30,269
- 一定 - 好
- Yes, indeed.
- Good.

458
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,782
- 见鬼 - 什么？
- Damn it.
- What?

459
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:46,493
我盼着在家里过春宵的
I was looking forward
to spending an evening at home.

460
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:53,000
我纳闷为什么迈克尔改变主意不去伦敦
I wonder why Michael's
changed his mind about going to London.

461
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:56,253
- 会议何时结束？- 晚上
- When does the conference finish?
- Late.

462
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:58,547
迈克尔去开会就在城里过夜
When Michael goes,
he stays the night in town.

463
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,633
- 是吗？- 嗯
- Does he?
- Hmm.

464
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:23,114
- 她很妖艳吧？- 我猜是的
- She's very beautiful, isn't she?
- I suppose she is.

465
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,159
你觉得她很有魅力吧？
Do you find her attractive?

466
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:31,785
- 不 不是 - 好
- No, I don't.
- Good.

467
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,249
他俩融洽吗？
Do they get on?

468
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,919
谁？迈克尔和茉莉？我想是的
Who? Michael and Molly? Yeah, I think so.

469
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:40,006
为什么问？
Why?

470
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:42,674
我不知道 就是有感觉
I don't know, just a feeling.

471
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:08,534
- 佩姬 我要去见迈克尔了 - 哎？
- Peg? I'm going over to see Michael.
- Yeah?

472
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:11,661
- 我已经做好咖啡了 - 我不会很久
-L've just made the coffee.
- I won't be long.

473
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:13,748
想想办法让你不用过夜
Try and arrange it so
you don't have to stay overnight.

474
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,250
好 我会的
Yeah, I'll try.

475
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:31,474
讨厌
Oh, bugger.

476
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:35,436
- 嗨 - 哦
- Hi.
- Oh.

477
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:39,731
- 抱歉我没有听见你 - 门是开的
-L'm sorry I didn't hear you.
- The door was open.

478
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,359
我觉得这个你们可能喜欢吃
I thought that you might like to have this.

479
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,111
哦
Oh.

480
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,785
最好放进冰箱
I'd put it in the fridge if I were you.

481
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,706
当然
Yes, of course.

482
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:08,089
- 你想喝咖啡吗？ - 好 但我就不坐了
- Would you like some coffee?
- Oh. Yes, please. But I'm not gonna stay.

483
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:11,680
我只是来看罗伯特能不能在伦敦给我捎点东西
I just came by to see if Robert could pick
something up for me while he's in London.

484
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:15,350
我肯定他会的 他刚去找你丈夫
I'm sure he will.
He's just popped over to see your husband.

485
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,436
他马上回来
He'll be back in a minute.

486
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:24,026
你想念伦敦吗 海勒太太？
Do you miss London, mrs Heller?

487
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:28,364
你在这难道不有点孤寂吗？
Doesn't it get a bit lonely for you up here?

488
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,866
我总是想生活在乡下
I've always wanted to live in the country.

489
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,993
谢谢
Thank you.

490
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:36,080
我猜想这与你习惯的生活不太一样
I imagine this life is a bit different
from what you're used to.

491
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,456
我不觉得
I don't think so.

492
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:42,336
打理房子包揽家务
Running a house and all that housework.

493
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,422
习惯就好
It's all a matter of what you're used to.

494
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:51,052
如果你厌倦了我们这儿 你总可以回伦敦
If you ever get tired of us here,
you can always go back to London.

495
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:53,055
我觉得我不会的
I don't think I will.

496
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:58,102
原谅我谈私人问题 但你看起来好稚嫩
Forgive me for being personal,
but you do seem terribly young,

497
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:01,229
- 就像个娃娃新娘 - 我22岁
-almost like a child bride.
-L'm 22.

498
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:03,482
哦
Oh.

499
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:08,987
我肯定罗伯特需要你 就像我们需要罗伯特
I'm sure that Robert needs you
as much as we need Robert.

500
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:11,406
我丈夫一直工作过劳
My husband's been terribly overworked

501
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:14,826
他精神压力过大
and the mental strain
has been very hard on him.

502
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:18,288
当然 他身体没病 但是...
Of course, he's physically all right, but, um...

503
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,043
我想你懂的
I think you understand.

504
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:28,507
谢谢你的咖啡
Thank you for the coffee.

505
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:33,132
如果你晚上孤单 给我打电话 我整晚在家
If you get lonely during the night,
give me a call. I'll be home all evening.

506
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:53,073
我真不想独自待在这里 就这样
It's just that I don't want to
stay here on my own, that's all.

507
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:55,159
我知道
I know that.

508
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:59,621
所以我建议你跟我去 在比密西太太家过夜
That's why I suggested you come up with me
and you stay the night at mrs beamish's.

509
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:02,290
为什么你必须在天上人间过夜？
Why do you have to stay at this club?

510
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:06,874
我告诉你了 迈克尔给我订的 我改不了
I've told you, darling. Michael booked me
in there. I can't change it now.

511
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:11,007
为什么你不在村子酒店过一夜？
Why don't you stay the night
at the pub in the village here?

512
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,259
为什么不？
Why not?

513
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:17,844
听着 鲍勃 如果我不能跟你睡 我还不如睡在家里
Look, Bob, if I can't stay with you,
i might just as well stay here.

514
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,684
你愿意跟茉莉和迈克尔今宵三人行吗？
Would you like to spend the evening
with Molly and Michael?

515
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:27,270
- 恐怕我跟茉莉不投缘 - 但你几乎不了解她
-L'm afraid I don't get on with Molly.
- But you've hardly met her.

516
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,027
今下午她来过这里
She came over here this afternoon.

517
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,696
她一个劲跟我说她觉得我明珠投暗
She managed to spend the whole time
telling me she didn't think I belonged here.

518
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:36,116
她觉得我会无聊想回伦敦
She thought I'd get bored
and want to go back to London.

519
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:38,285
她可能是大淫妇
She can be a terrible bitch.

520
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:47,127
我们别再为此操心了
Don't let's worry about it any more.

521
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:49,880
- 我睡在家里 - 你确定？
<i>-L'll</i> stay here.
- You sure?

522
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:52,508
- 对 我确定 - 好
- Yes, I'm sure.
- Okay.

523
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,593
来送我
Now, come and see me off.

524
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:14,776
你有警局号码吧？你有茉莉号码吧？
You've got the number of the police station,
right? And you've got Molly's number?

525
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:18,658
- 我不会需要拨打的 - 对 但你要有
- I shan't need that.
- No, but you've got it.

526
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:21,578
还有别的事吗？
Is there anything else?

527
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:23,664
那么就这样
Well, that's it then.

528
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:30,754
亲爱的 如果你想感觉更安全 带枪回家
Look, darling, if it makes you feel any safer,
take the gun with you into the cottage.

529
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:33,882
枪在路虎车上 但要小心 子弹上膛了
It's in the Land Rover,
but be careful, it's loaded.

530
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,678
- 明天见 - 保重 再见
<i>-L'll</i> see you tomorrow.
- Take care. Goodbye.

531
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,779
安静！
Silence!

532
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:58,845
海勒太太 我必须
Mrs Heller, I must...

533
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:44,265
佩姬 我回家了
Peg? I'm home.

534
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:53,394
佩姬 你在哪？
Peg? Where are you?

535
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:59,359
亲爱的？
Darling?

536
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,866
你到底在这干什么？
What on earth are you doing here?

537
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,993
- 我喜欢这里 - 你没事吧？
- I like it here.
- Are you all right?

538
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:15,750
- 怎么回事？ - 没事
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

539
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:22,048
- 你去哪儿？ - 回家做你的午餐
- Where are you going?
- Going back to the cottage to get your lunch.

540
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:35,394
门被打破了
It's been smashed.

541
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:37,563
你知道怎么回事吗？
Do you know anything about it?

542
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:45,571
看 这是什么？
Look. Here. What's this?

543
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:52,620
我不知道
I don't know.

544
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:04,507
你确定你不知道？
Are you sure you don't know what it is?

545
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,011
你在小屋没听见声音？
And you heard nothing from the cottage?

546
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:17,353
- 这是什么？ - 我不知道
- What's this?
- I don't know.

547
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:21,937
- 你洒的？ - 我一定是的
- Did you spill something?
- I must have done.

548
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,485
- 这是你的午餐 - 嗯？
- There's your lunch.
- Hmm?

549
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,781
你不吃吗？
Aren't you eating?

550
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:33,118
哦 你带枪回家了
Oh, you did bring the gun into the house.

551
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:42,962
- 你用了 - 不 我没有
- You've used it.
- No, I haven't.

552
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:49,343
两个枪筒都开火了 看！
Both these cartridges have been fired. Look!

553
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:52,179
是吗？
Have they?

554
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:54,640
佩姬 这到底怎么回事？
Peg, what the hell is going on here?

555
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:57,810
自从我回家后你一直不正面回答我
You haven't given me a straight answer
since I came home.

556
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:00,646
- 是吗？ - 对 你是的
- Haven't I?
- No, you haven't.

557
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:05,230
宿舍里发生了什么事 还有那里
There was what happened in the dormitory
and that.

558
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,195
我洒了东西
I spilled something.

559
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:11,820
- 是什么？ - 我忘了
- But what?
-L've forgotten.

560
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,993
枪怎么回事？开火了
But the gun? It's been fired.

561
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:22,502
我练枪
I was practising how to use it.

562
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:26,171
- 练枪？- 对 在船屋
- Practising?
- Yes. By the boathouse.

563
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:29,675
你之前忘了
And you'd forgotten.

564
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:38,309
听着 我爱你
Look, I love you.

565
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:42,146
如果出了事 不管什么事 告诉我
If anything has happened, anything at all,
tell me whatever it is.

566
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:44,732
我们一起解决 但是快告诉我
We'll sort it out together, but just tell me.

567
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:49,779
你不吃你的午餐吗？
Aren't you going to eat your lunch?

568
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:43,387
对 在船屋
Yes, down by the boathouse.

569
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:03,865
你找到你要找的东西吗？
Have you found what you're looking for?

570
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:06,202
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

571
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:08,287
你在找某样东西
You're looking for something.

572
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:14,502
对 是的
All right, I am.

573
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:17,713
我在找东西来搞清你发生了什么事
I'm looking for something
to explain what happened to you.

574
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:20,800
- 没发生什么 - 别老是跟我这么说
- Nothing happened.
- Don't keep telling me that.

575
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:23,760
你的表现明白告诉我 有鬼
Your behavioufls enough to tell me,
somethings wrong.

576
01:10:23,845 --> 01:10:28,345
- 我的表现？- 对 你变了
- My behaviour?
- Yes, you've changed.

577
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:32,936
你不告诉我为什么 我只好自己找出来
You won't tell me why,
so I've got to find out for myself.

578
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:35,564
通过湖里捞针？
By checking the lake?

579
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:40,148
- 你指望找到什么 罗伯特？- 我不知道
- What did you expect to find, Robert?
- I don't know.

580
01:10:40,445 --> 01:10:43,114
为什么你不问迈克尔？
Why don't you ask Michael?

581
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:27,533
佩姬 我想跟你谈谈
Peg, I want to talk to you.

582
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:35,249
有许多事我很久以前就该跟你说
There are a lot of things I should have
explained to you a long time ago.

583
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:37,335
是吗？
Are there?

584
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:42,548
你已经知道了一二
You already know about some of them.

585
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:44,842
是吗？
Do I?

586
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:51,890
- 比如说迈克尔 - 他怎么了？
- About Michael, for instance.
- What about him?

587
01:11:54,602 --> 01:11:59,102
我当时正要告诉你 我又好怕失去你
That's what I was going to tell you about.
I was terrified of losing you.

588
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:02,819
继续说
Go on.

589
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:10,447
这地方其实根本不是学校
Well, this place isn't really a school at all.

590
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:14,663
1963年后就不是了
It hasn't been since 1963.

591
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:18,334
过去是学校 很好的学校
It used to be a school, a very good one.

592
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:24,961
63年夏季发生可怕的事故
Then in the summer time of '63
there was a terrible accident.

593
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:29,924
一天晚上迈克尔发现东翼下面木工车间起了小火
One night, Michael discovered a small fire
in the carpentry shop, under the east wing.

594
01:12:31,806 --> 01:12:35,351
附近有个消防水桶
There was a fire bucket standing nearby.

595
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:37,310
他就将里面容物泼向火苗
He threw the contents on the flames

596
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:41,649
结果烈焰冲天
and it turned out to be some
sort of inflammable spirit.

597
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:46,194
整个地方焚烧大爆炸 多人受伤
The whole place went up in a tremendous
explosion and a lot of people were hurt.

598
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:53,076
警察赶来 孩子们被送回家
The police were called in.
The boys were sent home.

599
01:12:55,413 --> 01:12:57,706
学校关闭
The school closed down.

600
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:04,547
迈克尔严重烧伤
Michael was very badly burned.

601
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:11,095
好几周没脱离危险
And for weeks they thought
he was going to die.

602
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:14,556
一开始 他只能卧榻呻吟
To start with, he just lay there moaning.

603
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,935
喊着睡在火上方宿舍里的孩子的名字
Calling out the names of the boys
who slept in the dormitory over the fire.

604
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:26,818
他们死了
Those who had died.

605
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:34,910
我这样遇到迈克尔
That's how I met Michael.

606
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:37,788
在医院里 你瞧 我以前在那上班
At the hospital, you see. I worked there.

607
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:44,541
- 是吗？- 是的 我以前是医学生
- Did you?
- Yes, I was a medical student then.

608
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:47,631
我经常去各种医院打假期短工
I used to take holiday jobs
in various hospitals.

609
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:54,509
总之我们友好起来 他越来越依赖我
Anyway, we became friendly
and he grew to rely on me more and more.

610
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:58,476
以至于他出院回家的时候
So much so, in fact, that when it was time
for him to go home,

611
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:01,645
他妻子请求我能不能同去照顾他
his wife asked me if I'd go along with them
and look after him.

612
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:04,481
永久
Permanently.

613
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:06,858
我接受了
I accepted.

614
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:09,904
不仅仅因为报酬优厚 而且...
Not just because the money
was so good, but...

615
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:21,957
我真的以为我能帮助他
I really thought that I could help him.

616
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:26,541
于是 他重返这里 除去所有火灾痕迹
So, when he came back here,
he had all traces of the fire removed.

617
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:32,051
他开始管理这地方仿佛它依然是学校
He started to run the place
as if it was still a school.

618
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:35,387
如今一切完全如旧
And now, everything is exactly
as it used to be.

619
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:38,932
除了再也没人来
Except no one ever comes here.

620
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:43,516
没有学生 没有老师 没有家长 鬼都不来
No boys, no masters, no parents. Nothing.

621
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:49,981
他甚至在每个房间安设录音 至少听起来一样热闹
He's even fixed up recordings in every room,
so that at least things will sound the same.

622
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:55,449
他就漫步其间
But he just walks about.

623
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:57,493
扮演校长的角色
Playing at being headmaster.

624
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,385
我陪他一起角色扮演
And I play his game with him.

625
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:25,896
你瞧 他完全依赖我
You see, he relies on me totally.

626
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:30,480
所以我不明白这点太愚蠢了 你瞧
That's why it was so stupid of me
not to understand. You see...

627
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:33,654
我第一次向他提起你的时候
When I first mentioned you to him,

628
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:37,199
他就问我种种关于你的问题 你在伦敦的住处
he asked me questions about you like,
where you lived in London.

629
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:40,911
你的工作 你的相貌 你何时过来
What you did. What you looked like.
When you were coming down here.

630
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:44,456
我没考虑到他可能对你怀恨在心
I dismissed the possibility
that perhaps he resented you.

631
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:48,085
也许是因为我如此需要你在身边
Perhaps because I needed you so much.

632
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:52,669
你现在能明白为什么我如此急切想查明昨晚实情了
You can see now why I was so anxious
to find out what happened here last night.

633
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:55,509
他仍然需要我的帮助
He still needs my help.

634
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:03,100
你必须告诉我的就这么多？
Is that all you have to tell me?

635
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:07,684
对 除了你的安全对我来说比什么都重要
Yes. Except that your safety
means more to me than anything.

636
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:12,318
我恨自己在你跟我说被袭击后没有当回事
I hate myself for not taking you seriously
when you told me you'd been attacked.

637
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:16,488
但我当时真没法相信他企图在伦敦勒死你
But I just couldn't believe that he was
the one who tried to strangle you in London.

638
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:22,744
所以你瞧 佩姬 如果这里发生了什么事
So you see, peg,
if anything's happened here,

639
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:26,540
任何事 你必须告诉我
anything at all, you must tell me.

640
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:28,626
你懂吗？
Do you understand?

641
01:16:31,462 --> 01:16:33,422
他袭击你了吗？
Did he attack you?

642
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,300
你向他开枪了吗？
Did you shoot him?

643
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:47,724
- 他在哪里？- 我不知道
- Then where is he?
- I don't know.

644
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,744
- 也许她没有杀他 - 她当然杀了
- Maybe, she didn't kill him.
- Of course, she did.

645
01:17:03,828 --> 01:17:07,790
枪开火了 到处是血迹 大功告成
The gun's been fired and there's blood
all over the place. That part worked perfectly.

646
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:09,875
是之后出了差池
It's what happened afterwards
that's gone wrong.

647
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:14,459
她本该这次报警的
She should've called the police this time.

648
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:18,175
也许她觉得警察不会相信她
Perhaps she thought
that they wouldn't believe her.

649
01:17:18,259 --> 01:17:20,803
她没有问你为什么你不报警？
Hasn't she asked you
why you haven't called them?

650
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:25,182
那会看起来很傻 对吧？
That would look pretty stupid, wouldn't it?

651
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:29,766
你报警跟警察说你觉得你的妻子杀了我的丈夫
You calling the police and telling them that
you think your wife killed my husband.

652
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:34,733
我们面对吧 罗伯特 我们回归开始了
Let's face it, Robert.
We're back where we started.

653
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:38,028
不完全是 我现在有个老婆了
Not quite. I've got a wife now.

654
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:44,238
这是你出的主意 为什么你非要如此迂回？
Well, that was your idea.
Why do you have to be so devious?

655
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:47,704
为什么你不能带他到树林里一枪毙命？
Why couldn't you just have taken him out
into the woods and shot him yourself?

656
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:51,834
我之前告诉你了！如果要杀人 我们要有个杀人犯
I've told you before!
If there's a killing, we must have a killer.

657
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:54,669
如果我们做得像个事故 警察会来问很多问题
If we made it look like an accident,
they'd come round asking a lot of questions.

658
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:57,756
我们的办法是提供个杀人犯 真正的杀人犯
Our way, we provide the killer. The real killer.

659
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,925
然后我们就清清白白了
Then we're in the clear.

660
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:03,012
我们的办法貌似开始弄巧成拙了 你不觉得吗？
Our way's beginning to look a little sick
now, don't you think?

661
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:07,637
- 只要我们找到尸体就成功了 - 只要我们找到尸体
- It'll still work once we find the body.
- If we find the body.

662
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:12,562
- 要是我们找不到你怎么办？- 我们必须找到
- What are you going to do if we don't?
- We've got to.

663
01:18:12,646 --> 01:18:16,775
要么我们找出来 要么我们让她供出来
Either we find it or we get her to tell us
what she's done with it.

664
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:26,572
她正常吗？你的小娇妻
Is she normal? This cute little wife of yours.

665
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:31,411
当然她正常 她是我曾遇到的最正常的人
Of course, she's normal.
She's the most normal person I've ever met.

666
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:36,416
你的问题是你跟你丈夫相处太久了
The trouble with you is you have been
seeing too much of your husband.

667
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:39,339
她的表现可真奇怪呢
She certainly is behaving
in a most peculiar way

668
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:42,926
对于一个如此正常的人来说
for such a normal human being.

669
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:44,886
她会说什么做什么
What's she going to do and say

670
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:47,514
当你找到迈克尔的尸体将她交给警察的时候？
when you find Michael's body
and hand her over to the police?

671
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:50,559
不管她说什么 没人会相信她
It doesn't matter what she says.
Nobody will believe her.

672
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:52,645
警察至多相信她被一个装假臂的男人
Any more than they'll believe
that she was attacked by a man

673
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:55,272
袭击了两次
with an artificial arm on two other occasions.

674
01:18:55,356 --> 01:18:58,150
你享受干那事吗 罗伯特？我享受
Did you enjoy that bit, Robert? I did.

675
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:02,237
我好享受
Oh, I did.

676
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:05,824
我听见她跟你通话
When I heard her talking to you
on the phone,

677
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:08,160
“我也爱你 亲爱的”
"i love you too, darling."

678
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:13,582
对 比密西太太刚走
Yes, mrs beamish has just gone.

679
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:15,793
我也爱你 亲爱的
I love you too, darling.

680
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:21,335
你的新婚小娇妻 好纯洁天真
Your pretty little brand-new wife.
All innocence and purity.

681
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,511
我迫不及待想对她上下其手
I couldn't wait to get my hands on her.

682
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:34,186
我干的时候 时时刻刻反胃 我是为你做的
When I did it, I hated every minute of it.
I did it for you.

683
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,981
即使我跟她气喘吁吁的时候 我想的是你
Even when I was struggling with her,
i was thinking of you.

684
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:41,606
你和你丈夫和他的臭钱 我希望现在我们枕席重欢
You and your husband and his damn money.
I wish now we'd left things as they were.

685
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:45,656
我爱你
I love you.

686
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:50,239
- 你去哪儿？- 去让她说实话
- Where are you going?
- To make her tell the truth.

687
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:09,425
你喜欢吗？还不太对
You like it?
It's not quite right yet.

688
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:14,639
看来傻白甜的神情我做不出来
I don't seem to be able to get
the right simpering expression.

689
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,856
下次我用这手练刀
Next time I'll use the hand with the knife.

690
01:20:22,609 --> 01:20:23,735
哦
Oh.

691
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:27,030
不要望着你温柔的夫君求援
Don't look to your tender loving husband
for help.

692
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:34,454
告诉我们发生了什么 我不想让你受苦
Tell us what happened.
I don't want you to get hurt.

693
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:37,708
哦 我想
Oh, I do.

694
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:42,291
罗伯特有点拘谨 但我向你保证我毫不犹豫
Robert's a little bit squeamish, my dear.
But I assure you that I have no such scruples.

695
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:46,633
现在我再问你一次 他在哪？
Now, I shall ask you one more time.
Where is he?

696
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:48,719
我不知道
I don't know.

697
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:51,304
别留痕迹
No marks.

698
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:15,495
我做了可怕的事 我杀了迈克尔
"L have done a terrible thing.
I have killed Michael.

699
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:19,541
我不会试图辩解 只想说我们勾搭成奸
"L won't try to explain or justify it
except to say we were lovers

700
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:24,045
我们大吵一架 我现在无可如何了
"and we quarrelled.
I see no other way out now."

701
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:26,840
嗯 非常煽情 充满了正确的陈词滥调
Hmm. Very dramatic.
Full ofjust the right clichés.

702
01:21:29,343 --> 01:21:33,843
- 摹写她的签名 - 不 亲爱的 我不是造假专业户
- Copy her signature from that.
- Oh, no, darling. I'm no forger.

703
01:21:34,598 --> 01:21:39,098
我也不是 但你是女人 女人能比男人做的更好
Neither am I, but you're a woman.
A woman can do it better than a man.

704
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:44,604
- 原因如此吗？- 还能有什么原因？
- Is that the reason?
- What other reason could there be?

705
01:21:45,526 --> 01:21:50,026
难道不可能是你想让我多担责 保险起见？
Couldn't it be that you just wanted me a little
more involved, as a sort of insurance policy?

706
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,159
你的责任已经跑不掉了 宝贝
You're involved up to here already, my pet.

707
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,540
既然你不能找到迈克尔
Since you haven't been able to find Michael,

708
01:22:00,624 --> 01:22:03,293
什么让你觉得警察能？
what makes you think
that the police are going to be able to?

709
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:07,172
他们是专家 迈克尔就在此地某处 或死或活
They're experts. Michael's here somewhere,
either dead or dying.

710
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:13,841
- 我跟你做个交易 罗伯特 - 什么交易？
<i>-L'll</i> make a deal with you, Robert.
- What?

711
01:22:14,888 --> 01:22:18,892
我会找到迈克尔 如果他还活着 我杀了他
I'll find Michael.
And if he's still alive, I'll kill him.

712
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,812
如果你写这签名
If you sign this.

713
01:22:25,149 --> 01:22:29,649
- 你怎么认为你会找到他？- 她知情
- How do you think you'll find him?
- She knows something.

714
01:22:30,404 --> 01:22:32,781
我打算查个水落石出
And I intend to find out what it is.

715
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:39,951
- 好吧 但她一定不能有外伤 - 交给我吧
- All right, but she mustn't be marked.
- Leave that to me.

716
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:42,290
我是个女人 记得吧？
I'm a woman, remember?

717
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:45,585
我会找到办法让她外伤轻微
I'm gonna find something
that will mark her a little,

718
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:47,712
但极度痛苦
but hurt her a lot.

719
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:28,795
我看你把这留在壁炉台上了
I suppose you'd have left this
on a mantelpiece somewhere.

720
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:31,464
警察必须在你身上发现它
They'll just have to find it on you.

721
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:37,470
佩姬 你有最后一次机会
Peggy, you've got one last chance.

722
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:42,054
如果你痛快说 说出迈克尔在哪 你就没事
If you tell us everything. If you tell us
where Michael is now, you'll be all right.

723
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:46,771
我们只会报警 警察会带你回医院
We'll simply phone the police and they'll
put you back in hospital somewhere.

724
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:49,774
将来谁知道？也许他们会放了你
For the future, who knows?
Maybe they'll let you out.

725
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:54,821
你想告诉我吗？
Do you want to tell me?

726
01:23:57,991 --> 01:24:01,327
你是傻瓜 佩姬
You're a fool, Peggy.

727
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:05,953
我向你保证 等茉莉回来后 你会告诉我们
I promise you something,
when Molly gets back here, you'll tell us.

728
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:08,794
你会告诉我们一切你知道的
You'll tell us everything you know.

729
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:10,879
而且等到你搜肠刮肚 你会开始胡编乱造
And when you've done that,
you'll start making things up.

730
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:13,090
你会说任何话来求她停止伤害你
You'll say anything to stop her
from hurting you.

731
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:26,895
快起来 外面去 走！
Come on. Up. Outside. Move!

732
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:50,391
晚上好 罗伯特 我恭候多时了
<i>Good evening, Robert.
I've been waiting here to welcome you.</i>

733
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:57,731
我希望枪里没有子弹 如果走火 会吵醒孩子们的
<i>I hope that gun isn't loaded.
If it went off, it would waken the boys.</i>

734
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:03,904
你知道我不允许 他们需要睡眠 你明白
<i>You know I couldn't allow that.
They need their sleep, you see.</i>

735
01:26:04,284 --> 01:26:06,286
考试压力很大
<i>The pressure of exams.</i>

736
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:12,375
你在哪 迈克尔？
Where are you, Michael?

737
01:26:12,459 --> 01:26:16,463
你很清楚我不会把有子弹的枪带进学校的
You know perfectly well I wouldn't carry
a loaded gun in the school.

738
01:26:16,546 --> 01:26:21,046
我多傻 我忘了你总是把孩子们的福祉放在心上
<i>How stupid of me. I'd forgotten.
You've always had the boys' welfare at heart.</i>

739
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:26,927
我想 罗伯特 假以时日 你可能成为非常优秀的校长
<i>I think, Robert, that given time, you might
have made a very good schoolmaster.</i>

740
01:26:28,058 --> 01:26:32,558
孩子们喜欢你 我相信你也喜欢他们
<i>The boys liked you.
And I believe you liked them.</i>

741
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,786
茉莉你在吗？跟他说
Are you here? Speak to him.

742
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:54,208
告诉他下来跟我们谈
Tell him to come down and talk to us.

743
01:26:56,461 --> 01:27:00,089
你在找我的妻子？
<i>Are you looking for my wife?</i>

744
01:27:00,173 --> 01:27:04,385
你们最近彼此见面太多了
<i>You've been seeing far too much
of each other lately.</i>

745
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:07,680
我总是担心家长们会听到闲话
<i>I'm always afraid the parents
will get to hear about it.</i>

746
01:27:07,764 --> 01:27:11,934
很惊讶孩子们会怎么写信回家
<i>It's surprising what boys write about
in their letters home.</i>

747
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:16,188
有孩子们 校长 能听见你说的每句话
The boys, headmaster,
can hear every word you say.

748
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:18,774
是吗？
<i>Can they?</i>

749
01:27:18,859 --> 01:27:22,821
为什么不到大厅来？我们可以安静谈谈
Why not come down into the hall?
We can talk things over quietly.

750
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:26,782
但我就在大厅
<i>But I am in the hall.</i>

751
01:27:26,867 --> 01:27:30,245
啊 更好 现在我们可以看见所处位置了
<i>Ah, that's better.
Now, we can see where we are.</i>

752
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:36,918
茉莉在哪？
Where's Molly?

753
01:27:37,002 --> 01:27:39,379
她就在我旁边
<i>She's right beside me.</i>

754
01:27:39,463 --> 01:27:43,925
在丈夫需要帮助的时刻贤妻都该这样
<i>Where all good wives should be.
In their husband's hour of need.</i>

755
01:27:44,009 --> 01:27:47,721
或者这是你需要帮助的时刻 罗伯特？
<i>Or is this your hour of need, Robert?</i>

756
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:50,431
我观察你们俩很久了
<i>I've been watching you two for a long time.</i>

757
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:52,850
你们以为我没有注意到
<i>Did you think I didn't notice on the occasions</i>

758
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:55,728
你们一起偷偷去树林吗？
<i>when you stole away
into the woods together?</i>

759
01:27:55,812 --> 01:28:00,312
我听到你们谈话 一切计划 你们几近成功 不是吗？
<i>I heard you talking. Planning everything.
And you very nearly succeeded, didn't you?</i>

760
01:28:02,736 --> 01:28:05,697
对 我们是的
Yes. We did.

761
01:28:05,822 --> 01:28:08,491
对 你们几近成功
<i>Yes, you nearly succeeded.</i>

762
01:28:08,575 --> 01:28:12,328
但我必须告诉你 罗伯特 最好的谋杀犯都检查自己的武器
<i>But I must tell you, Robert,
all the best murderers check their weapons.</i>

763
01:28:12,412 --> 01:28:15,790
你狡猾劝说可怜的佩姬携带的枪
<i>The gun you so cunningly persuaded
poor Peggy to keep with her</i>

764
01:28:15,916 --> 01:28:20,416
装的是空包弹 我调包了 你知道吗
<i>was loaded with blanks.
I'd removed the shot, you see.</i>

765
01:28:21,213 --> 01:28:23,465
这次不是了
Not this time.

766
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:26,676
正如你的算盘 她试图向我开枪
<i>And she tried to shoot me
just as you wanted her to.</i>

767
01:28:28,887 --> 01:28:33,266
我只是想跟她谈谈 你现在知道了吧
<i>I only wanted to talk to her.
You know that now, don't you, my dear?</i>

768
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:37,229
食物储藏室里有只兔子
<i>There was a rabbit in the larder.</i>

769
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:41,607
我把它的血洒在地板上 使得看起来好像她枪杀了我
<i>I spilt some of its blood on the floor
and made it look as if she had shot me.</i>

770
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:45,945
你看见后 我就知道你会做傻事
<i>When you saw it, I knew you would
do something foolish</i>

771
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:48,031
你做了
<i>and you did.</i>

772
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:53,911
现在你又做了
<i>And now, you've done it again.</i>

773
01:28:56,456 --> 01:28:58,749
你要非常小心
<i>You want to be very careful.</i>

774
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:09,928
但没有第三次了 迈克尔
But not a third time, Michael.

775
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:14,140
我就知道你会用你愚蠢的电子装置说话
I might have known you'd use your
ridiculous electric gadget to speak through.

776
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:20,313
跟男孩们告别吧 校长
Say goodbye to the boys, headmaster.

777
01:29:20,438 --> 01:29:22,523
期末到了
It's the end of term.

778
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:09,612
混蛋！你在哪里？
Bastard! Where are you?

779
01:30:09,696 --> 01:30:13,908
有种出来 疯子混蛋！
Show your face, you mad bastard!

780
01:30:13,992 --> 01:30:17,286
你 我会找到你！
You... I'll find you!

781
01:30:19,998 --> 01:30:22,083
我会找到你！
I'll find you!

782
01:30:50,612 --> 01:30:55,112
我会找到你！我会回来 我会找到你
I'll find you. I'll come back and I'll find you.

783
01:30:55,784 --> 01:30:58,787
如果我找不到 我会把这地方烧为平地
And if I don't,
I'll burn this place down round your ears.

784
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:15,720
我会找到你！
I'll find you!

785
01:32:12,444 --> 01:32:14,612
前面有人 长官
Someone up ahead, sir.

786
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:21,660
你没事吧 小姐？
Are you all right, miss?

787
01:32:21,786 --> 01:32:24,622
我们接到电话 小姐 说有情况
We got a call, miss.
There's been some trouble.

788
01:32:24,706 --> 01:32:28,751
卡米克尔先生在吗 小姐 我想是他报的警
Is mr Carmichael there, miss.
I think it was him who called us.

789
01:32:28,835 --> 01:32:33,214
他在 新学期开始了
Yes, he's there. It's the start of a new term.

790
01:32:33,298 --> 01:32:35,883
不可能 小姐 这地方关闭多年了
It can't be that, miss.
This place has been closed for years.

791
01:32:35,967 --> 01:32:38,552
我们知道卡米克尔先生用作私人住宅
We understood mr Carmichael
was running it as a private house.
