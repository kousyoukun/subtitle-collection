1
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,336
<i>Quiet, please. Everybody, quiet.</i>

2
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:00,053
<i>We will now sing
the beginning of term hymn,</i>

3
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:05,263
<i>"Lord, receive us with thy blessing,
once again assembled here."</i>

4
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:37,127
I don't really need you any more, do I?

5
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,754
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before.

6
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:43,713
It's just I was afraid, really,
you might not approve.

7
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:47,516
I'd made up my mind
that was what I wanted to do.

8
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,435
- When did you get married?
- Last week.

9
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:54,231
He's away at the moment.
We haven't even had our honeymoon yet.

10
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,775
He had to leave the day after the wedding.

11
00:03:56,862 --> 00:04:00,526
Tell me about him. What does he do?

12
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:04,779
He's a schoolteacher.
He works in the country.

13
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,362
So I'll have to leave Mrs Beamish.

14
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,205
You'll soon find
someone else, Mrs Beamish.

15
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,408
Ah, but not like you, dear.

16
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:16,629
Quiet as a mouse. The place always spotless.

17
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,958
There aren't many around
like you these days.

18
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:25,008
It's all parties,
friends popping in at all hours.

19
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:29,342
- You were never like that.
- No, I wasn't.

20
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:34,181
I think they're very lucky to be getting you.
The school, I mean.

21
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:39,436
Think of it, living among
all those happy little boys.

22
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,567
Quite a family you'll have.

23
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,024
A hundred and fifty of them.

24
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:49,658
- You'll make a fine wife for a teacher.
- I hope so.

25
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,997
Is Mr Robert coming to collect you?

26
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:56,164
- Yes, he's driving up in the morning.
- Ah. That'll be nice.

27
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,121
It'll be a sort of honeymoon
for you, won't it?

28
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:02,959
Yeah. At least we've got
the holidays to look forward to.

29
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,426
- Will you be living near the school?
- I think so.

30
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,551
Robert says
we've got a cottage on the grounds.

31
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,764
Oh. That's nice.

32
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,809
They sound very nice,
the headmaster and his wife.

33
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,270
They do. I haven't met them yet.

34
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,639
Plenty of time for that.

35
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:24,484
I'll see you in the morning
before you go, then.

36
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,609
Goodbye, dear.

37
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,193
- Night-night.
- Good night and pleasant dreams.

38
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,111
Hello, Robert.

39
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,034
Where are you?

40
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,999
The school, of course.
Where did you think I'd be?

41
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,123
We've just had the end of term feast.

42
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:24,252
A hundred and fifty of the little monsters
stuffing themselves into insensibility.

43
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,629
Now they've all gone to bed with the wind.

44
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,213
You should have been here.
Like pigs at a swill.

45
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:34,016
Oh, Michael and Molly send their love,
they're longing to meet you.

46
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,934
Are you alone?

47
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,269
Yes, Mrs Beamish has just gone.

48
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,184
I love you, too.

49
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,316
Okay, I'll see you about
11:00 in the morning.

50
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,334
How do you feel?

51
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:54,505
Relax, young lady.
You got a nasty bump on the head.

52
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,270
- Did you catch him?
- Catch who?

53
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,394
He was in the bathroom.
He was waiting for me.

54
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,475
There was no one here, dear.

55
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:11,731
I heard this thump on the floor.
I came upstairs to see if you were all right.

56
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,608
And I found you
stretched out on the bathroom floor.

57
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,234
He tried to strangle me.

58
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,113
We'd better ring the police.

59
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,369
Could I have a word with you, Doctor?

60
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,277
How do you feel now?

61
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,201
Have you called the police?

62
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,404
Later.

63
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,365
Mrs Beamish tells me
you haven't been very well lately.

64
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,663
I don't understand.

65
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,662
You had a nervous breakdown.

66
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,583
That was about six months ago.

67
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,381
That's not very long.

68
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,338
These things take a long time to sort out.

69
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,886
A very long time.

70
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,219
I didn't just imagine that.

71
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,475
Tell me what happened, from the beginning.

72
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,693
It was after you went. Robert phoned.

73
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,900
And after I had spoken to him,

74
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,652
I went and put the chain on the door,
and then...

75
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:40,244
The chain wasn't on, dear. I let myself in.

76
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,863
I used my pass key.

77
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,244
The chain wasn't on.

78
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,123
He must have gone out that way, then.

79
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,166
I'll call the police if you're not going to.

80
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,384
No. We'll do it.

81
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,981
How long do you think it'll be
before I'm really better?

82
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,559
You're much better now.

83
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:15,863
When I was in the hospital,
there was a girl called Gillian.

84
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,826
Do you remember her?
I used to share a room with her.

85
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:25,907
She kept imagining that there was
someone following her and watching her.

86
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,914
Of course, we knew there wasn't,
but she really believed there was.

87
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,088
She'd had a breakdown, too,

88
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,167
but I think hers must have
been much worse than mine.

89
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,799
That was the second time she'd been back.

90
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,591
She thought she was really better.

91
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:48,725
They must have thought she was, too,
or they wouldn't have let her go, would they?

92
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,648
But it was afterwards, though,

93
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:56,774
when she'd left, when she was on her own,
that she started imagining those things.

94
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,268
Are you sure
you're feeling all right?

95
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,190
Mmm.

96
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,648
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

97
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,651
I am sorry.

98
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,659
I was looking forward
to the drive and everything.

99
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:51,037
And now it's spoiled?

100
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,665
- No. It's not spoiled, it's just...
- What?

101
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,838
I don't know.

102
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,215
These things take time to mend.

103
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,764
You'll see, once they catch him.

104
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:11,638
- They will catch him, won't they?
- Of course they will. You're safe now.

105
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,830
I'm sorry. I was miles away.

106
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,333
- Where were you?
- I was thinking,

107
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,461
because of you, I'm gonna be
the butt of countless schoolboy jokes.

108
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,588
- Why?
- 'Cause they'll fancy you.

109
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,386
At least the older ones will.

110
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,009
"Old Heller's found himself a smashing bird,
you should see her. â€œ

111
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,058
And they'll make up wildly erotic stories
about what you and I get up to.

112
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,558
I shall invite
the attractive ones over for tea.

113
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,768
- Attractive what?
- Boys.

114
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,728
There aren't any.

115
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:06,033
I shall listen to all their problems.
I'll tell them to wash behind their ears,

116
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,032
and I'll tell them to be
especially nice to you.

117
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,454
That'll go down a bomb.

118
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:15,500
- I know I'm gonna love it.
- Monstrous little brutes.

119
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:19,079
Our cottage will be placed out of bounds
on the first day of term.

120
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,630
- Oh, I can't wait to see it.
- I hope you like it.

121
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,259
I'm sure I will. Is it near the school?

122
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,101
- What's it like?
- What's what like?

123
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,481
- The school.
- Big.

124
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,779
- And?
- Big.

125
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,985
- Is it old?
- It's not old at all, actually, it just looks old.

126
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,194
Old and decrepit.

127
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:54,407
It was only built about 60 years ago,
as a matter of fact.

128
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,618
Stockbroker Tudor, they used to call it.

129
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,374
It's been neglected recently.

130
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,628
It could do with a good coat of paint.

131
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:08,713
Needs re-plastering in places.
Full of dry rot, too, probably.

132
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,389
I think it's marvellous. Can we go inside?

133
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,850
This is the main hall, the assembly hall,
the great hall.

134
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,899
Chapel on Sundays.
Gathering point on speech days.

135
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:29,324
What you might call
the hub of the establishment.

136
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,447
The Carmichaels live in a private wing
at the back of the house.

137
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,153
Do you want to pay your respects
now or later?

138
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,282
Oh, no. Later.

139
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,992
- They won't eat you.
- I know, but I'd rather leave it till tomorrow.

140
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,703
You'll like him.
She can be a bit odd at times, though.

141
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,960
- I'm sure they're both very nice.
- Mmm.

142
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,542
This place must have cost a fortune.

143
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,003
- Does Mr Carmichael own it?
- Yes, he does.

144
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,589
- He must be very rich.
- He would be if he sold it.

145
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,390
Do you know a property developer
offered him a quarter of a million for it,

146
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,683
and he turned them down?

147
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,387
- The school must mean a lotto him.
- Yes, it does.

148
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,066
Welcome to the lower fourth,
known among the staff as the Snake Pit.

149
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:06,732
- Why is it called the Snake Pit?
- You should be here in term time.

150
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:10,862
It's all so clean, Bob. Are the desks new?

151
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,989
- It's not like our school.
- Why not?

152
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,070
Oh, everything there was chaos.

153
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,326
Teachers always complaining
about being overworked.

154
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,624
We got lots more to see.

155
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,747
You must have an enormous staff
to run this place.

156
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,545
- Not really.
- Where are we going now?

157
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,996
- I'll show you.
- Where?

158
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,958
- You'll see.
- Oh, what's that?

159
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,595
- It's not very pretty, is it?
- It's horrible.

160
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:36,391
It's one of Molly Carmichael's.
She's a sculptress.

161
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:40,141
- I don't like it.
- Mmm. It is a bit savage.

162
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,222
Have the boys seen it?

163
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,983
What a strange thing
to have in a boys' school.

164
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,904
- Why?
- Just having to look at that every day.

165
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,026
I suppose you're right. Come on.

166
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,003
What do you think?

167
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,298
- It's lovely.
- Do you like it?

168
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:09,837
Mmm.

169
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,716
- I love it.
- What were you expecting?

170
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,136
I don't know.

171
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:22,062
Something smaller and darker,
and lots of old books.

172
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:25,061
It's nice, Bob. Who had it before you?

173
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:29,941
Oh. Maths master.
He retired at the end of last term. Ooh!

174
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,068
Went to live in Brighton.

175
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:37,862
It's not so bad, I suppose. All mod cons.

176
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,196
Even champagne.

177
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,368
To us, then.

178
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,383
- Do you think you're gonna be happy here?
- Of course I am.

179
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:59,888
- I shall be out most of the time during term.
- Don't worry, it's your work.

180
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:04,392
- Don't you like it?
- I don't like work of any sort.

181
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:07,565
I'd rather spend most of my time with you.

182
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:10,144
I thought all teachers
were supposed to be dedicated.

183
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,320
I'm not.

184
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:16,195
- I wish I had just half Carmichael's money.
- Oh, don't be silly.

185
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,027
- He probably envies you.
- Do you think so?

186
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,326
You're probably right.

187
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,748
The trouble with him is... Oh.

188
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,623
See what I mean? Not a moment's peace.

189
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:36,545
Oh. Hello, Michael.
It's the headmaster. Sorry, what?

190
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,846
Yes, of course.

191
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,678
Yes, I'll pick them up for you.

192
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,264
At what time?

193
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:50,316
The 11:45 from London.

194
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,399
Fine.

195
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,946
What?

196
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,745
Oh. She's fine.
We moved in this afternoon, yes.

197
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,746
Tomorrow night.

198
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,952
Yes, we'd love to.

199
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,162
Dinner tomorrow.

200
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,874
No, I'm sorry. I was just telling Peggy.

201
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:17,552
Yes, 8:30 will be fine. All right.

202
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,130
Yes. See you then. Bye.

203
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,977
They've invited us for dinner.

204
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,096
Oh.

205
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,017
- It's okay, isn't it?
- Yes, of course.

206
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:37,273
Good. Remind me that I've gotta go
to the station tomorrow morning.

207
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,491
What was that you were
gonna say about Michael before he phoned?

208
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:41,534
Nothing.

209
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,029
You were just about to
say something about...

210
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,716
You all right?

211
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,427
Mmm.

212
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:09,600
You're still worried about that man,
aren't you?

213
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,648
I just can't believe it happened.

214
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:16,603
But you're safe now.

215
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,735
I shall feel better
when I know they've caught him.

216
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:24,865
Even if they don't,
you're miles away from London. You're safe.

217
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:33,271
- What are you doing out of bed?
- I couldn't sleep.

218
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,395
Must be the champagne.

219
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,523
I keep thinking I can see someone.

220
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:43,857
- Where?
- Over there by the window.

221
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,192
Can you see anyone?

222
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,454
I can't see a thing.

223
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,750
- You're right about one thing, though.
- What?

224
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:58,205
The champagne. It's upset you.

225
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,791
Now come on back to bed.

226
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:22,362
There's no one there.

227
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,861
I did see someone.

228
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,534
Come back to bed.

229
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,990
There was someone there.

230
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,075
Perhaps there was.

231
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,794
Maybe it was Michael.

232
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:44,467
He often walks about the school at night.

233
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,545
- Why?
- I don't know.

234
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:54,094
Get some sleep. You've had a long day.

235
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:27,548
- You forgot to kiss me.
- No, I didn't. That's why I stopped.

236
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,128
- I don't think I like this.
- What?

237
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,089
- You're going off to work.
- I'll be back this afternoon.

238
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,345
I know.

239
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:39,142
You do that every time I go off to work
and I shan't go off to work.

240
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,684
What are you gonna do today?

241
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,395
Would it be all right
if I go and look at the big house?

242
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,695
Why?

243
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:50,366
I just thought I'd walk around it a bit,
make friends with it.

244
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,990
- I promise I won't touch anything.
- All right. I'll see you later.

245
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,163
Take care.

246
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:27,041
Quiet, please. Everybody, quiet.

247
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:39,512
Please, sir, is a mountain masculine?

248
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:43,717
Boy, what is a mountain?

249
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,640
<i>Mons, sir. Mons montis.</i>

250
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:53,352
<i>Masculine are fons and mons,</i>

251
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,187
<i>chalybs, hydrops, gryps and pons.</i>

252
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,243
All together, then.

253
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,072
<i>Masculine are fons and mons,</i>

254
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:09,454
<i>chalybs, hydrops, gryps and pons.</i>

255
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:39,155
Sorry if I frightened you. Please sit down.

256
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,777
Oh. No, I'm sorry. I
didn't realise you were...

257
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,779
Please. Sit down.

258
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,865
Have a desk.

259
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,628
You must be Mrs Heller, Robert's wife.

260
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:58,208
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm the headmaster.

261
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,509
- Michael Carmichael.
- How do you do?

262
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,133
- I expect you...
- You must think...

263
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,009
- I'm sorry.
- No, my dear.

264
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,932
What were you going to say?

265
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,478
You must think me very rude.
I didn't mean to come in like that.

266
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,555
I didn't realise you were working.

267
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,689
I've never thought of it as work.

268
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:20,567
To me, teaching has always
been a sort of hobby.

269
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:25,489
I like it. Do you see? I like to see
my boys get a good start in life.

270
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,494
They have to work, poor chaps.

271
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,667
Our job is really to teach them how to learn.

272
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:38,084
Do you know that is the most difficult part,
to make them want to learn?

273
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,513
How much of the school have you seen?

274
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,136
Oh.

275
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:53,643
I've seen the main hall and the dining room,
and one of the dormitories.

276
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:57,066
Robert said it would be all right
as long as I didn't touch anything.

277
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,154
Did he?

278
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,399
Then you must see some more.

279
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,406
Please.

280
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:25,048
- And how long have you known Robert?
- Oh, about four months.

281
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,221
A quick courtship.

282
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:32,518
- How did you meet?
- Oh, just through friends.

283
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:36,973
Would that all of life's associations
were so simply forged.

284
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:39,900
We're very pleased to have you with us.

285
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:44,322
You're so pretty.
You've already done me a power of good.

286
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:47,446
You are a most welcome
addition to our large family.

287
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:51,200
The boys will be impressed,
mightily impressed.

288
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,999
Ah. This is their locker room.

289
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,701
Everything's so clean and tidy.

290
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,253
I expect it's very different
when the boys are here.

291
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:03,458
Of course, the academic standards of today
are much the same as they've always been.

292
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:06,840
But there is a very much
higher degree of competition these days.

293
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:11,341
More boys trying for places
in the best schools and universities.

294
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:15,932
Oh, dear me, you must think me
a very dry old stick.

295
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:22,231
The call me Old Gig Lamps,
behind my back, of course.

296
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,312
Come, I must show you the gymnasium.

297
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,151
Here it is.

298
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:36,412
Now, we have the usual parallel bars,
various vaulting horses,

299
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,664
and that is where we hold
the annual school play.

300
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,626
But I've always taken
a very special interest in knots.

301
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,212
I find them not only excellent therapy,

302
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:54,472
but most rewarding
in the study of character formation.

303
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,644
Do you like tying knots
in things, Mrs Heller?

304
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:00,814
I don't know. I've never really tried.

305
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:04,314
Did anyone ever tell you
you have the most beautiful hair?

306
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,610
On.

307
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:12,201
No, I don't think so.

308
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:16,076
- I never know what to do with it.
- It looks charming as it is.

309
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,157
But perhaps...

310
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:23,295
If you removed the scarf, let it hang free.

311
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,714
Oh, it would look a mess.

312
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:29,881
- It needs washing.
- Oh, I don't think so.

313
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:33,760
- Will you?
- What now?

314
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,262
As a favour to an old man?

315
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,427
Oh...

316
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,942
Please, allow me.

317
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,706
Ooh!

318
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,255
Caught in the knot of your scarf.

319
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,458
Ooh!

320
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,544
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

321
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,629
Nearly done.

322
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:20,182
Before I met you
I thought I heard a class going on.

323
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,263
Sounded like a Latin class.

324
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:29,650
They seemed to be enjoying it.
They must like their work.

325
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,776
All that laughter.

326
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,904
Boys will be boys.

327
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:38,825
Do you keep recordings
of the classes to study?

328
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:46,079
This must be a wonderful house to live in.

329
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:50,792
Don't you sometimes wish that it wasn't
a school and you had it to yourselves?

330
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,214
Ooh.

331
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,721
- Finished.
- Thank you.

332
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,859
Now, I must leave you.

333
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,778
We have a conference to attend
tomorrow in London.

334
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:15,574
I'm afraid I shall have to take your Robert
away from you for a short time.

335
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,652
It is only during the school holidays
that we are able to attend

336
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:23,457
the numerous extracurricular activities
that make up a schoolmaster's lot.

337
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:28,371
You have seen our display of cups.

338
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:33,175
No? Ah. They are something I'm particularly
proud of, as a matter of fact.

339
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,925
I've always believed in the awarding
of trophies for athletic prowess.

340
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:41,930
It stimulates effort,
puts the keen edge into competitive sport.

341
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,639
We had a boy here once,
many years ago now,

342
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,942
he won six cups in one year.

343
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:54,067
Practically a clean sweep, a fine boy.

344
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:06,284
Thank you very much
for showing me around.

345
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:09,245
Robert says we're having
dinner with you tonight.

346
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,751
See you then. Goodbye.

347
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,916
Bob, is that you?

348
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:27,498
Bob, it was him.
I was attacked by the same man.

349
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,826
- It couldn't happen again, Peg.
- Bob...

350
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:34,626
But it was! He must have followed me here.

351
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:39,585
- Why?
- I don't know why.

352
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,091
Didn't you see him?

353
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:44,264
I didn't see anyone, Peg.

354
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:46,763
I came in and found you stretched out
on the living room floor.

355
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,436
That was where he attacked me, Bob.

356
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:53,766
I thought I saw you from the house
and I came over to find you.

357
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,353
He was waiting for me, Bob,
like he was before.

358
00:35:57,447 --> 00:36:01,691
- I'll fetch the doctor.
- No. Call the police.

359
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:04,368
- Oh. Peg, be reasonable.
- Please, Bob, please. Call the police.

360
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:07,242
I'm all right, please.

361
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,911
Bob, I was attacked!

362
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,463
Bob, I was attacked. I was.

363
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:24,092
You don't believe me, do you?

364
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:29,719
I believe you think you were attacked.

365
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:33,898
What I really think happened is that
you either fainted or fell...

366
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,974
Your imagination did the rest.

367
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,311
My imagination.

368
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:46,069
Last Tuesday I went out to dinner.

369
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:50,030
It was with a friend of Mrs Beamish's.

370
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:54,540
I supposed she thought I was lonely
so she asked this man to take me out.

371
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:59,339
We went out to have something to eat...

372
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,507
I don't know why,
but I thought he put something in my drink.

373
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,141
I suppose I lost control.

374
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:17,771
He had to phone Mrs Beamish
and ask her to come and get me.

375
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:20,774
And she kept trying to convince me that

376
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:25,108
he was a friend of hers
and he wouldn't do anything like that, but...

377
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:30,283
I didn't believe her.

378
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,081
I'm afraid I didn't like him.

379
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:37,503
He kept saying it must have been
my imagination.

380
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,580
It couldn't have been my imagination.

381
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:48,263
- Could it?
- Yeah.

382
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,842
I'll tell you what, sleep on it.

383
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:55,429
If you feel the same way in the morning,
then we'll call the police.

384
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,942
Now, try and get some rest.

385
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:04,613
I'll call the Carmichaels
and tell them you're not well.

386
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,297
- Want some more coffee?
- Mmm.

387
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:43,944
What's it to be?
Do we call the police or don't we?

388
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,524
You don't want me to, do you?

389
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:51,030
I want to do what's best for you.

390
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:56,490
No, you don't. You think I might
make a fool of myself, don't you?

391
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,825
No, I don't.

392
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,331
Tell me one thing.

393
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:08,919
Now, in the cold light of morning,
do you still say you were attacked?

394
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,675
I was attacked, I was.

395
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:19,851
It must have been the same man, mustn't it?

396
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,023
I'll call them.

397
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,104
What's happening to me?

398
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:32,276
Nothing.

399
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,504
Do you want me to call them?

400
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,480
Do you want to come out with me today?

401
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,107
I've got some work to do.
You won't be bored?

402
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,196
Go upstairs and get dressed. Hmm?

403
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,112
Do you want your coffee?

404
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:24,707
You realise I've got to go to London
this afternoon?

405
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,585
Yes, Mr Carmichael told me.

406
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,962
Michael?

407
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:33,671
Yes, I met him yesterday.
He showed me around the school.

408
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,847
You didn't tell me.

409
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,010
Go on, up you go.

410
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,404
- Have you finished?
- Finished here.

411
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:01,490
- Got to go over to the woods now.
- Oh.

412
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,791
I could drop you off at
home first, if you like.

413
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,040
No, it's all right. I've come this far.

414
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,121
Jump in.

415
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,389
Jim says part of the boundary fence
has collapsed.

416
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,471
- You cold?
- Yes, I am a bit.

417
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,728
Hang on. Here.

418
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:31,278
- Bob, is that yours?
- Hmm? No, it's Michael's.

419
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:34,277
Like the Land Rover. Let's face it,
everything around here belongs to Michael.

420
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:36,904
- Is it loaded?
- Of course it is.

421
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:41,080
- What does he use it for?
- Rabbits, foxes, you know.

422
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,127
I hate guns.

423
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,958
It's beautiful. Does he own all this?

424
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:30,037
Twelve hundred acres in all. I won't be long.

425
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:27,219
What the hell are you doing here?

426
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,157
You could get your head blown off
creeping around like that.

427
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:44,277
Don't you know this is private property?

428
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:48,741
Well?

429
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:51,953
I said this is private property.
Didn't you see the signs?

430
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,913
God knows we put enough of them up.

431
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,998
No, I didn't. I'm sorry.

432
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:59,172
Well, then I suggest that...

433
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:05,595
- Oh. Hello, Robert.
- I see you two have met then.

434
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:11,222
- Oh. Is this the bride?
- Yes, this is Peggy.

435
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,352
Peggy. Molly Carmichael. Peggy, my wife.

436
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,146
Why didn't you say so, my dear?

437
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:18,649
I nearly made a widower out of you, Robert.

438
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,401
- How do you mean?
- I didn't know she was there.

439
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,483
Another couple of yards, and...

440
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:28,079
Darling, you must be more careful.

441
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:33,626
It was my fault, really. I just assumed
there was nobody around. I'm sorry.

442
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:39,048
How very pretty you are.

443
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:42,173
- You did well for yourself, Robert.
- Yes, I did.

444
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,173
About last night, I'm very sorry,

445
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:50,181
- it was just at the last minute...
- A headache.

446
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:52,683
Trying to do too much
on her first day at school.

447
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:55,432
You must take better care of her, Robert.

448
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,893
I'm sure he hasn't the remotest idea of
how to be a good husband.

449
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,862
I've always thought of him
as the perennial bachelor.

450
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:07,156
Oh. By the way, Robert, Michael wants you to
go up to London by yourself this afternoon.

451
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:11,490
- But the conference?
- I think he wants you to represent him.

452
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:15,999
All right, as long as he gives me his report
and tells me what to say.

453
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,876
Oh. You must come
and have tea with us soon.

454
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,003
As soon as I get the cottage sorted out.

455
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:24,093
Oh. Thank you, I'd like that.

456
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,798
Will you drop by the house later on then?
I'm sure Michael would like to talk to you.

457
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:30,259
- Yes, indeed.
- Good.

458
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,779
- Damn it.
- What?

459
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:46,483
I was looking forward
to spending an evening at home.

460
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:52,997
I wonder why Michael's
changed his mind about going to London.

461
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:56,247
- When does the conference finish?
- Late.

462
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:58,544
When Michael goes,
he stays the night in town.

463
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,622
- Does he?
- Hmm.

464
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:23,111
- She's very beautiful, isn't she?
- I suppose she is.

465
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,148
Do you find her attractive?

466
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:32,121
- No, I don't.
- Good.

467
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,243
Do they get on?

468
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,917
Who? Michael and Molly? Yeah, I think so.

469
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:39,995
Why?

470
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:42,672
I don't know, just a feeling.

471
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:08,524
- Peg? I'm going over to see Michael.
- Yeah?

472
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:11,655
- I've just made the coffee.
- I won't be long.

473
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:13,737
Try and arrange it so
you don't have to stay overnight.

474
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,243
Yeah, I'll try.

475
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:31,467
Oh, bugger.

476
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:35,426
- Hi.
- on.

477
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:39,729
- I'm sorry I didn't hear you.
- The door was open.

478
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,352
I thought that you might like to have this.

479
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,108
Oh.

480
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,782
I'd put it in the fridge if I were you.

481
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,700
Yes, of course.

482
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:08,208
- Would you like some coffee?
- Oh. Yes, please. But I'm not gonna stay.

483
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:11,670
I just came by to see if Robert could pick
something up for me while he's in London.

484
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:15,348
I'm sure he will.
He's just popped over to see your husband.

485
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,425
He'll be back in a minute.

486
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:24,023
Do you miss London, Mrs Heller?

487
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:28,354
Doesn't it get a bit lonely for you up here?

488
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,859
I've always wanted to live in the country.

489
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,982
Thank you.

490
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:36,069
I imagine this life is a bit different
from what you're used to.

491
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,450
I don't think so.

492
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:42,330
Running a house and all that housework.

493
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,411
It's all a matter of what you're used to.

494
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:51,050
If you ever get tired of us here,
you can always go back to London.

495
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:53,048
I don't think I will.

496
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:58,096
Forgive me for being personal,
but you do seem terribly young,

497
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:01,223
- almost like a child bride.
- I'm 22.

498
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:03,471
Oh.

499
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:08,981
I'm sure that Robert needs you
as much as we need Robert.

500
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:11,403
My husband's been terribly overworked

501
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:14,820
and the mental strain
has been very hard on him.

502
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:18,278
Of course, he's physically
all right, but, um...

503
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,032
I think you understand.

504
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:28,504
Thank you for the coffee.

505
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:33,968
If you get lonely during the night,
give me a call. I'll be home all evening.

506
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:53,071
It's just that I don't want to
stay here on my own, that's all.

507
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:55,148
I know that.

508
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:59,611
That's why I suggested you come up with me
and you stay the night at Mrs Beamish's.

509
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:02,288
Why do you have to stay at this club?

510
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:07,039
I've told you, darling. Michael booked me
in there. I can't change it now.

511
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:10,997
Why don't you stay the night
at the pub in the village here?

512
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,253
Why not?

513
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:18,430
Look, Bob, if I can't stay with you,
I might just as well stay here.

514
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,673
Would you like to spend the evening
with Molly and Michael?

515
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:27,936
- I'm afraid I don't get on with Molly.
- But you've hardly met her.

516
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,016
She came over here this afternoon.

517
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,694
She managed to spend the whole time
telling me she didn't think I belonged here.

518
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:36,113
She thought I'd get bored
and want to go back to London.

519
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:38,279
She can be a terrible bitch.

520
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:47,117
Don't let's worry about it any more.

521
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:49,873
- I'll stay here.
- You sure?

522
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:52,501
- Yes, I'm sure.
- Okay.

523
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,582
Now, come and see me off.

524
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:15,112
You've got the number of the police station,
right? And you've got Molly's number?

525
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:18,656
- I shan't need that.
- No, but you've got it.

526
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:21,575
Is there anything else?

527
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:23,653
Well, that's it then.

528
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:30,751
Look, darling, if it makes you feel any safer,
take the gun with you into the cottage.

529
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:33,876
It's in the Land Rover,
but be careful, it's loaded.

530
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,672
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Take care. Goodbye.

531
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,768
Silence!

532
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:58,842
Mrs Heller, I must...

533
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:44,259
Peg? I'm home.

534
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:53,387
Peg? Where are you?

535
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:59,349
Darling?

536
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,863
What on Earth are you doing here?

537
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,987
- I like it here.
- Are you all right?

538
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:15,747
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

539
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:22,038
- Where are you going?
- Going back to the cottage to get your lunch.

540
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:35,384
It's been smashed.

541
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:37,560
Do you know anything about it?

542
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:45,569
Look. Here. What's this?

543
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:52,609
I don't know.

544
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:04,501
Are you sure you don't know what it is?

545
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,005
And you heard nothing from the cottage?

546
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:17,347
- What's this?
- I don't know.

547
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:22,102
- Did you spill something?
- I must have done.

548
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,479
- There's your lunch.
- Hmm?

549
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,774
Aren't you eating?

550
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:33,112
Oh, you did bring the gun into the house.

551
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:42,955
- You've used it.
- No, I haven't.

552
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:49,341
Both these cartridges have been fired. Look!

553
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:52,169
Have they?

554
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:54,630
Peg, what the hell is going on here?

555
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:57,807
You haven't given me a straight answer
since I came home.

556
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:00,636
- Haven't I?
- No, you haven't.

557
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:05,270
There was what happened in the dormitory
and that.

558
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,192
I spilled something.

559
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:11,905
- But what?
- I've forgotten.

560
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,982
But the gun? It's been fired.

561
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:22,499
I was practising how to use it.

562
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:26,169
- Practising?
- Yes. By the boathouse.

563
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:29,669
And you'd forgotten.

564
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:38,303
Look, I love you.

565
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:42,136
If anything has happened, anything at all,
tell me whatever it is.

566
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:44,730
We'll sort it out together, but just tell me.

567
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:49,776
Aren't you going to eat your lunch?

568
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:43,384
Yes, down by the boathouse.

569
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:03,855
Have you found what you're looking for?

570
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:06,191
I don't know what you're talking about.

571
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:08,276
You're looking for something.

572
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:14,495
All right, I am.

573
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:17,703
I'm looking for something
to explain what happened to you.

574
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:20,789
- Nothing happened.
- Don't keep telling me that.

575
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:23,750
Your behaviour's enough to tell me,
something's wrong.

576
01:10:23,845 --> 01:10:29,215
- My behaviour?
- Yes, you've changed.

577
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:32,926
You won't tell me why,
so I've got to find out for myself.

578
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:35,557
By checking the lake?

579
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:40,358
- What did you expect to find, Robert?
- I don't know.

580
01:10:40,445 --> 01:10:43,107
Why don't you ask Michael?

581
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:27,530
Peg, I want to talk to you.

582
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:35,247
There are a lot of things I should have
explained to you a long time ago.

583
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:37,324
Are there?

584
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:42,538
You already know about some of them.

585
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:44,839
Do I?

586
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:51,884
- About Michael, for instance.
- What about him?

587
01:11:54,602 --> 01:12:00,723
That's what I was going to tell you about.
I was terrified of losing you.

588
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:02,808
Go on.

589
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:10,441
Well, this place isn't
really a school at all.

590
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:14,660
It hasn't been since 1963.

591
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:18,331
It used to be a school, a very good one.

592
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:25,331
Then in the summer time of '63
there was a terrible accident.

593
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:31,716
One night, Michael discovered a small fire
in the carpentry shop, under the east wing.

594
01:12:31,806 --> 01:12:35,344
There was a fire bucket standing nearby.

595
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:37,300
He threw the contents on the flames

596
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:41,639
and it turned out to be some
sort of inflammable spirit.

597
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:46,192
The whole place went up in a tremendous
explosion and a lot of people were hurt.

598
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:53,074
The police were called in.
The boys were sent home.

599
01:12:55,413 --> 01:12:57,700
The school closed down.

600
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:04,540
Michael was very badly burned.

601
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:11,085
And for weeks they thought
he was going to die.

602
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:14,546
To start with, he just lay there moaning.

603
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,929
Calling out the names of the boys
who slept in the dormitory over the fire.

604
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:26,808
Those who had died.

605
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:34,900
That's how I met Michael.

606
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:37,782
At the hospital, you see. I worked there.

607
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:44,581
- Did you?
- Yes, I was a medical student then.

608
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:47,628
I used to take holiday jobs
in various hospitals.

609
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:55,254
Anyway, we became friendly
and he grew to rely on me more and more.

610
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:58,466
So much so, in fact, that when it was time
for him to go home,

611
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:01,642
his wife asked me if I'd go along with them
and look after him.

612
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:04,471
Permanently.

613
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:06,852
I accepted.

614
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:09,901
Not just because the money
was so good, but...

615
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:21,955
I really thought that I could help him.

616
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:27,957
So, when he came back here,
he had all traces of the fire removed.

617
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:32,041
He started to run the place
as if it was still a school.

618
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:35,377
And now, everything is exactly
as it used to be.

619
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:38,930
Except no one ever comes here.

620
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:45,388
No boys, no masters, no parents. Nothing.

621
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:51,568
He's even fixed up recordings in every room,
so that at least things will sound the same.

622
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:55,443
But he just walks about.

623
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:57,490
Playing at being headmaster.

624
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,382
And I play his game with him.

625
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:25,894
You see, he relies on me totally.

626
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:30,895
That's why it was so stupid of me
not to understand. You see...

627
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:33,647
When I first mentioned you to him,

628
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:37,197
he asked me questions about you like,
where you lived in London.

629
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:40,901
What you did. What you looked like.
When you were coming down here.

630
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:44,454
I dismissed the possibility
that perhaps he resented you.

631
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:48,078
Perhaps because I needed you so much.

632
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:53,380
You can see now why I was so anxious
to find out what happened here last night.

633
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:55,503
He still needs my help.

634
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:03,090
Is that all you have to tell me?

635
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:08,520
Yes. Except that your safety
means more to me than anything.

636
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:12,315
I hate myself for not taking you seriously
when you told me you'd been attacked.

637
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:16,486
But I just couldn't believe that he was
the one who tried to strangle you in London.

638
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:22,734
So you see, Peg,
if anything's happened here,

639
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:26,537
anything at all, you must tell me.

640
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:28,615
Do you understand?

641
01:16:31,462 --> 01:16:33,419
Did he attack you?

642
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,290
Did you shoot him?

643
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:48,640
- Then where is he?
- I don't know.

644
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,733
- Maybe, she didn't kill him.
- Of course, she did.

645
01:17:03,828 --> 01:17:07,787
The gun's been fired and there's blood all
over the place. That part worked perfectly.

646
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:09,864
It's what happened afterwards
that's gone wrong.

647
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:15,170
She should've called the police this time.

648
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:18,169
Perhaps she thought
that they wouldn't believe her.

649
01:17:18,259 --> 01:17:20,796
Hasn't she asked you
why you haven't called them?

650
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:25,171
That would look pretty stupid, wouldn't it?

651
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:30,386
You calling the police and telling them that
you think your wife killed my husband.

652
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:34,723
Let's face it, Robert.
We're back where we started.

653
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:38,022
Not quite. I've got a wife now.

654
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:44,357
Well, that was your idea.
Why do you have to be so devious?

655
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:47,694
Why couldn't you just have taken him out
into the woods and shot him yourself?

656
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:51,824
I've told you before!
If there's a killing, we must have a killer.

657
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:54,659
If we made it look like an accident,
they'd come round asking a lot of questions.

658
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:57,745
Our way, we provide the killer.
The real killer.

659
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,922
Then we're in the clear.

660
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:03,001
Our Way's beginning to look a little sick
now, don't you think?

661
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:08,723
- It'll still work once we find the body.
- If we find the body.

662
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:12,552
- What are you going to do if we don't?
- We've got to.

663
01:18:12,646 --> 01:18:16,765
Either we find it or we get her to tell us
what she's done with it.

664
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:26,817
Is she normal? This cute
little wife of yours.

665
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:31,826
Of course, she's normal.
She's the most normal person I've ever met.

666
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:36,626
The trouble with you is you have been
seeing too much of your husband.

667
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:39,329
She certainly is behaving
in a most peculiar way

668
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:42,916
for such a normal human being.

669
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:44,876
What's she going to do and say

670
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:47,507
when you find Michael's body
and hand her over to the police?

671
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:50,556
It doesn't matter what she says.
Nobody will believe her.

672
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:52,634
Any more than they'll believe
that she was attacked by a man

673
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:55,265
with an artificial arm
on two other occasions.

674
01:18:55,356 --> 01:18:58,144
Did you enjoy that bit, Robert? I did.

675
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:02,234
Oh, I did.

676
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:05,814
When I heard her talking to you
on the phone,

677
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:08,149
"I love you too, darling."

678
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:13,575
Yes, Mrs Beamish has just gone.

679
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:15,782
I love you too, darling.

680
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:22,672
Your pretty little brand-new wife.
All innocence and purity.

681
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,508
I couldn't wait to get my hands on her.

682
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:34,180
When I did it, I hated every minute of it.
I did it for you.

683
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,978
Even when I was struggling with her,
I was thinking of you.

684
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:42,852
You and your husband and his damn money.
I wish now we'd left things as they were.

685
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:45,653
I love you.

686
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:50,779
- Where are you going?
- To make her tell the truth.

687
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:10,045
You like it?
It's not quite right yet.

688
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:15,179
I don't seem to be able to get
the right simpering expression.

689
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,850
Next time I'll use the hand with the knife.

690
01:20:22,609 --> 01:20:23,724
Oh.

691
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:27,028
Don't look to your tender loving husband
for help.

692
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:34,447
Tell us what happened.
I don't want you to get hurt.

693
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:37,698
Oh, I do.

694
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:42,501
Robert's a little bit squeamish, my dear. But
I assure you that I have no such scruples.

695
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:46,627
Now, I shall ask you one more time.
Where is he?

696
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:48,708
I don't know.

697
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:51,302
No marks.

698
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:15,485
"I have done a terrible thing.
I have killed Michael.

699
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:19,538
"I won't try to explain or justify it
except to say we were lovers

700
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:24,035
"and we quarrelled.
I see no other way out now."

701
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:26,837
Hmm. Very dramatic.
Full of just the right clichÃ©s.

702
01:21:29,343 --> 01:21:34,463
- Copy her signature from that.
- Oh, no, darling. I'm no forger.

703
01:21:34,598 --> 01:21:40,014
Neither am I, but you're a woman.
A woman can do it better than a man.

704
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:45,440
- Is that the reason?
- What other reason could there be?

705
01:21:45,526 --> 01:21:51,647
Couldn't it be that you just wanted me a little
more involved, as a sort of insurance policy?

706
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,152
You're involved up to here already, my pet.

707
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,538
Since you haven't been able to find Michael,

708
01:22:00,624 --> 01:22:03,286
what makes you think
that the police are going to be able to?

709
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:07,166
They're experts. Michael's here somewhere,
either dead or dying.

710
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:14,802
- I'll make a deal with you, Robert.
- What?

711
01:22:14,888 --> 01:22:18,882
I'll find Michael.
And if he's still alive, I'll kill him.

712
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,806
If you sign this.

713
01:22:25,149 --> 01:22:30,269
- How do you think you'll find him?
- She knows something.

714
01:22:30,404 --> 01:22:32,771
And I intend to find out what it is.

715
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:40,161
- All right, but she mustn't be marked.
- Leave that to me.

716
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:42,284
I'm a woman, remember?

717
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:45,583
I'm gonna find something
that will mark her a little,

718
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:47,706
but hurt her a lot.

719
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:28,792
I suppose you'd have left this
on a mantelpiece somewhere.

720
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:31,462
They'll just have to find it on you.

721
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:37,468
Peggy, you've got one last chance.

722
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:42,048
If you tell us everything. If you tell us
where Michael is now, you'll be all right.

723
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:46,761
We'll simply phone the police and they'll
put you back in hospital somewhere.

724
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:49,768
For the future, who knows?
Maybe they'll let you out.

725
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:54,818
Do you want to tell me?

726
01:23:57,991 --> 01:24:01,325
You're a fool, Peggy.

727
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:06,448
I promise you something,
when Molly gets back here, you'll tell us.

728
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:08,783
You'll tell us everything you know.

729
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:10,868
And when you've done that,
you'll start making things up.

730
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:13,079
You'll say anything to stop her
from hurting you.

731
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:26,885
Come on. Up. Outside. Move!

732
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:50,727
<i>Good evening, Robert.
I've been waiting here to welcome you.</i>

733
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:59,318
<i>I hope that gun isn't loaded.
If it went off, it would waken the boys.</i>

734
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:04,194
<i>You know I couldn't allow that.
They need their sleep, you see.</i>

735
01:26:04,284 --> 01:26:06,275
<i>The pressure of exams.</i>

736
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:12,369
Where are you, Michael?

737
01:26:12,459 --> 01:26:16,453
You know perfectly well I wouldn't carry
a loaded gun in the school.

738
01:26:16,546 --> 01:26:21,336
How stupid of me. I'd forgotten.
You've always had the boys' welfare at heart.

739
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:27,968
<i>I think, Robert, that given time, you might
have made a very good schoolmaster.</i>

740
01:26:28,058 --> 01:26:32,894
<i>The boys liked you.
And I believe you liked them.</i>

741
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,784
Are you here? Speak to him.

742
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:54,201
Tell him to come down and talk to us.

743
01:26:56,461 --> 01:27:00,079
<i>Are you looking for my wife?</i>

744
01:27:00,173 --> 01:27:04,383
<i>You've been seeing far too much
of each other lately.</i>

745
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:07,678
<i>I'm always afraid the parents
will get to hear about it.</i>

746
01:27:07,764 --> 01:27:11,928
<i>It's surprising what boys write about
in their letters home.</i>

747
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:16,182
The boys, Headmaster,
can hear every word you say.

748
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:18,772
<i>Can they?</i>

749
01:27:18,859 --> 01:27:22,818
Why not come down into the hall?
We can talk things over quietly.

750
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:26,772
<i>But I am in the hall.</i>

751
01:27:26,867 --> 01:27:30,235
<i>Ah, that's better.
Now, we can see where we are.</i>

752
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:36,912
Where's Molly?

753
01:27:37,002 --> 01:27:39,369
<i>She's right beside me.</i>

754
01:27:39,463 --> 01:27:43,923
<i>Where all good wives should be.
In their husband's hour of need.</i>

755
01:27:44,009 --> 01:27:47,718
<i>Or is this your hour of need, Robert?</i>

756
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:50,421
<i>I've been watching you two for a long time.</i>

757
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:52,847
<i>Did you think I didn't
notice on the occasions</i>

758
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:55,722
<i>when you stole away
into the woods together?</i>

759
01:27:55,812 --> 01:28:02,650
<i>I heard you talking. Planning everything.
And you very nearly succeeded, didn't you?</i>

760
01:28:02,736 --> 01:28:05,694
Yes. We did.

761
01:28:05,822 --> 01:28:08,484
<i>Yes, you nearly succeeded.</i>

762
01:28:08,575 --> 01:28:12,318
<i>But I must tell you, Robert,
all the best murderers check their weapons.</i>

763
01:28:12,412 --> 01:28:15,780
<i>The gun you so cunningly persuaded
poor Peggy to keep with her</i>

764
01:28:15,916 --> 01:28:21,127
<i>was loaded with blanks.
I'd removed the shot, you see.</i>

765
01:28:21,213 --> 01:28:23,454
Not this time.

766
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:26,666
<i>And she tried to shoot me
just as you wanted her to.</i>

767
01:28:28,887 --> 01:28:33,256
<i>I only wanted to talk to her.
You know that now, don't you, my dear?</i>

768
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:37,218
<i>There was a rabbit in the larder.</i>

769
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:41,601
<i>I spilt some of its blood on the floor
and made it look as if she had shot me.</i>

770
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:45,935
<i>When you saw it, I knew you would
do something foolish</i>

771
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:48,020
<i>and you did.</i>

772
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:53,901
<i>And now, you've done it again.</i>

773
01:28:56,456 --> 01:28:58,743
<i>You want to be very careful.</i>

774
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:09,921
But not a third time, Michael.

775
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:14,130
I might have known you'd use your
ridiculous electric gadget to speak through.

776
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:20,303
Say goodbye to the boys, Headmaster.

777
01:29:20,438 --> 01:29:22,520
It's the end of term.

778
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:09,602
Bastard! Where are you?

779
01:30:09,696 --> 01:30:13,906
Show your face, you mad bastard!

780
01:30:13,992 --> 01:30:17,280
You... I'll find you!

781
01:30:19,998 --> 01:30:22,080
I'll find you!

782
01:30:50,612 --> 01:30:55,652
I'll find you. I'll come
back and I'll find you.

783
01:30:55,784 --> 01:30:58,776
And if I don't,
I'll burn this place down round your ears.

784
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:15,710
I'll find you!

785
01:32:12,444 --> 01:32:14,606
Someone up ahead, sir.

786
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:21,654
Are you all right, miss?

787
01:32:21,786 --> 01:32:24,619
We got a call, miss.
There's been some trouble.

788
01:32:24,706 --> 01:32:28,745
Is Mr Carmichael there, miss.
I think it was him who called us.

789
01:32:28,835 --> 01:32:33,204
Yes, he's there. It's the
start of a new term.

790
01:32:33,298 --> 01:32:35,881
It can't be that, miss.
This place has been closed for years.

791
01:32:35,967 --> 01:32:38,550
We understood Mr Carmichael
was running it as a private house.
