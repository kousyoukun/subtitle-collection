00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:25,220
You have to ask yourself...

2
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:28,887
what brought the person
to this point.

3
00:02:28,962 --> 00:02:34,457
What was seen in his face,
his manner, that channeled him here.

4
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:37,594
You have
to convince yourself...

5
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:42,938
that this person has something hidden
that you have to find.

6
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:48,106
You check his bags,
but it's his face...

7
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:51,947
his gestures that
you're really watching.

8
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:56,913
Thank you.

9
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:17,375
He's staring straight at you.

10
00:03:17,444 --> 00:03:20,208
Look at him, carefully.

11
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,578
What do you see?

12
00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:26,949
Security 4 to Baggage Claim 17.

13
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:41,065
- Where you headed?
- Uh, downtown.

14
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,565
- You want to split it?
- S-Sure.

15
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:03,687
What? Not tonight.
Are you sure?

16
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:06,055
Well, can't you cancel?

17
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:22,938
Oh. Uh... what are these?

18
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:25,671
Ballet tickets for tonight.

19
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:28,612
Oh.

20
00:04:28,682 --> 00:04:33,551
- You don't like ballet?
- Well, some ballets.

21
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,350
Well, that's exactly
what this is: some ballet.

22
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:39,358
Look, you can always scalp
the tickets at the door.

23
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:42,554
Oh, you mean, uh,
take these in exchange...

24
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:46,690
- for you paying your part of the fare.
- Well, what do you think?

25
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:10,018
- See ya, John.
- Good night, John.

26
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,024
- See you guys.
- See ya.

27
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:37,375
Christina, here you are.
Hurry and get dressed.

28
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,543
- People are asking for you.
- * Exotica *

29
00:06:04,077 --> 00:06:07,012
- She's right over there. I'll get her.
- * Exotica *

30
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,105
Bye.

31
00:06:13,753 --> 00:06:18,213
Yeah!

32
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,521
Let's bring those big, hairy
palms together, gentlemen...

33
00:06:20,593 --> 00:06:22,788
and have a nice,
big round of applause...

34
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:25,194
for Kali!

35
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:27,199
Kali.

36
00:06:27,267 --> 00:06:29,201
Yes, indeed. Kali.

37
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:32,033
And you, too, can- You, too,
can have Kali come over to your table...

38
00:06:32,105 --> 00:06:35,871
for only five dollars, where she can
show you the mysteries of her world.

39
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:40,606
Trust me, gentlemen. Trust me.

40
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:29,852
Oh! Baby, baby, baby!

41
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:35,026
Ooh! Do it for me, baby!

42
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:40,869
Oh! My God, that's incredible.
That's incredible.

43
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,374
Let me ask you something,
gentlemen.

44
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:47,539
What is it that gives a schoolgirl
her special innocence?

45
00:07:47,614 --> 00:07:53,382
Her sweet fragrance? Fresh flowers...
light as a spring rain?

46
00:07:53,453 --> 00:07:55,887
Oh, my God.
My God.

47
00:07:55,955 --> 00:07:58,549
Or is it her firm, young flesh
inviting your every caress...

48
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,059
enticing you to explore...

49
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:06,360
her deepest
and most private secrets?

50
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:11,495
Well, gentlemen, I'm gonna let you
decide that one for yourselves.

51
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:14,836
Please join me
in welcoming a sassy...

52
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:18,844
bit of jailbait
to our stage.

53
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:23,349
Yes, indeed.

54
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,180
Come out, sweet Chrissy.

55
00:08:26,252 --> 00:08:28,846
Wherever you are, baby,
come on out.

56
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:50,032
You think you're bad, eh, baby?

57
00:09:51,603 --> 00:09:53,402
You're bad.

58
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:13,558
That will be $5.50.

59
00:10:19,163 --> 00:10:22,230
Thank you.

60
00:11:50,323 --> 00:11:53,815
- Eric?
- What?

61
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:58,262
Linda finished her dance.

62
00:11:58,331 --> 00:12:02,097
Let's bring those big, hairy
palms together, gentlemen.

63
00:12:02,168 --> 00:12:06,264
Give it up. Yeah, gentlemen. Yes.

64
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:11,675
Have a nice, big round
of applause for Linda. Yeah.

65
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:14,645
Yes, indeed, Linda.

66
00:12:14,714 --> 00:12:16,944
And just a reminder that there is
nothing Linda would love more...

67
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:19,382
than to slink over
to your table and...

68
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:23,718
give you your own private show
for only five dollars.

69
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,724
That's right.

70
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:29,853
Five dollars is all it takes
to have one of our beautiful foxes...

71
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:33,228
come over to your table
and get you all hot and bothered.

72
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:36,063
But, hey, why be bothered...

73
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:40,401
when you're being treated
like a king?

74
00:12:40,473 --> 00:12:45,069
You've had a rough day.

75
00:12:45,144 --> 00:12:48,375
Don't you think you owe it
to yourselves to...

76
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:52,282
do something that'll make you feel
like you're someone special?

77
00:12:54,353 --> 00:12:58,687
You are someone special.

78
00:12:58,758 --> 00:13:03,218
Five dollars is all
it takes to prove it.

79
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,837
Yes, let's have a nice big round
of applause for Michelle.

80
00:13:47,907 --> 00:13:51,070
My God, that was beautiful.

81
00:13:53,112 --> 00:13:55,603
Ooh, baby, you come out.

82
00:13:55,681 --> 00:13:59,117
And just to remind you that, uh, there's
nothing Michelle would love more...

83
00:13:59,185 --> 00:14:01,449
than to come over to your table
and give you your own private dance.

84
00:14:03,856 --> 00:14:06,848
Hello, gentlemen!

85
00:14:06,926 --> 00:14:08,860
Anybody out there?
Anybody alive?

86
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:11,726
Anybody, for five dollars,
you can have Kali.

87
00:14:11,797 --> 00:14:15,927
Kali at your own private table.

88
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,874
Let me ask you something,
gentlemen.

89
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:25,172
What is it
about a schoolgirl...

90
00:14:25,244 --> 00:14:28,702
that gives her that
special innocence?

91
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:34,913
Is it the way that
they can gaze at you...

92
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:39,048
waiting for you to say something
with so much expectation and hope...

93
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:43,721
that you're just...
you're just paralyzed into...

94
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:48,798
into silence?

95
00:15:38,684 --> 00:15:43,178
- Look, uh, I want to give this back to you.
- Why?

96
00:15:43,256 --> 00:15:46,020
Well, you see,
those tickets were given to me...

97
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:50,859
and, uh, I just feel uncomfortable
about having sold them.

98
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,899
- That's okay.
- No, no, no, really, I-

99
00:15:58,304 --> 00:16:01,239
We never really introduced ourselves.
I'm Thomas.

100
00:16:01,307 --> 00:16:03,241
David.

101
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:05,675
Can I use this
to take you out for a drink?

102
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:10,614
- Oh, that's, uh, very kind
of you, but, uh- - But what?

103
00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:14,517
But I really have
to get home.

104
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:57,489
Thanks.

105
00:16:57,563 --> 00:16:59,497
Are you available
next Thursday?

106
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:01,556
- Uh, I think so, yeah.
- Good, good.

107
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:06,335
- Tracey?
- Yeah?

108
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:08,669
I'm not that boring, am I?

109
00:17:08,741 --> 00:17:12,677
- What do you mean?
- Well, the earphones.

110
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:15,441
I mean, we used to listen
to the radio...

111
00:17:15,514 --> 00:17:19,473
and you used to ask me
all sorts of questions.

112
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:22,248
So you want me
to ask more questions?

113
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:27,620
Sure. Yeah, I mean, if there's
something y-you want to know.

114
00:17:28,928 --> 00:17:31,192
Okay. I'll see
what I can think up.

115
00:17:31,263 --> 00:17:33,288
- Say hi to your dad.
- I will.

116
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:35,300
- Good night.
- Good night.

117
00:17:55,788 --> 00:17:59,656
- Did someone say something?
- No.

118
00:17:59,725 --> 00:18:01,920
So, what's the point?

119
00:18:01,994 --> 00:18:05,327
I've just noticed
a change in your attitude.

120
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:12,963
Look, I would understand if you would
prefer not to introduce Christina.

121
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:17,475
I could do it myself.

122
00:18:17,543 --> 00:18:19,875
Actually, I've been thinking
that, perhaps...

123
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:24,279
I should be getting more involved
in the introductions overall.

124
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:29,583
I could have my own microphone,
like my mother used to do.

125
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:32,954
No, I mean, I actually
enjoy introducing Christina.

126
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:35,653
I mean, I find it
very therapeutic, you know?

127
00:18:35,728 --> 00:18:39,789
- That's not what you're getting paid for.
- Well, it seems to me...

128
00:18:39,865 --> 00:18:44,097
that I'm being paid to make every girl
seem like she's something special, right?

129
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:49,369
- So, in order to do that,
I have to let my imagination run wild.

130
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:55,005
So, I mean, when it comes
to Christina, I, you know-

131
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,776
My imagination is bound
to run a little wilder.

132
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,580
There's nothing that I can do
to control that, Zoe.

133
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:03,315
Makes the clients uncomfortable.

134
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:06,085
And you think your state
puts them at ease?

135
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:17,769
Hey.

136
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:21,668
Is he kicking?

137
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,177
All the time.

138
00:19:29,381 --> 00:19:31,576
Do you feel like touching it?

139
00:19:43,496 --> 00:19:45,430
Oh.

140
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:56,939
How are you feeling about this?

141
00:19:57,009 --> 00:20:00,536
- Fine.
- Fine?

142
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:03,241
Are you happy?

143
00:20:03,315 --> 00:20:05,442
For you.

144
00:20:08,354 --> 00:20:11,551
What about you, Eric?
What about you?

145
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:16,017
Well, I guess I got to be pretty careful
about my feelings, right?

146
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:19,428
I mean, uh...

147
00:20:19,498 --> 00:20:23,559
that's why we have
a contract, isn't it?

148
00:20:29,074 --> 00:20:31,668
There's plaster dust
all over the apartment.

149
00:20:31,744 --> 00:20:35,578
No, I'm not exaggerating. No, I was
coughing in my sleep last night.

150
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:38,742
You told me that it was going to be
comfortable for me to live there...

151
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:40,910
and it is not
comfortable.

152
00:20:40,986 --> 00:20:42,920
There's plastic
on the furniture.

153
00:20:42,988 --> 00:20:46,082
That is not comfortable living.

154
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:49,218
Yeah. Oh, come on, look.

155
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:53,459
You told me you were going to strip
the wallpaper, not strip the walls down.

156
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:56,467
Well, no, if you'd,
if you'd told me in the first place-

157
00:20:56,535 --> 00:20:59,026
If you'd told me what kind of job
it was, then I would have considered it.

158
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:03,438
Although, it's- It makes me seem
like you've maybe made a mistake.

159
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:06,603
That's what it makes me suspect.

160
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,613
What? No, it's too late now.
It's inaccessible.

161
00:21:11,684 --> 00:21:14,653
I'm not gonna pay you. Pay you for what?
You didn't do the job.

162
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,918
Well, you did a job, but it's not
the job that I asked you to do.

163
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:21,755
It's not the job
we agreed on.

164
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:25,058
Well, I can get anyone,
any number of people to do this.

165
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:29,123
Yeah, that's just fine with me.

166
00:21:32,705 --> 00:21:35,902
Yeah, can I help you?

167
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:39,436
- Mr. Pinto?
- Uh, yes.

168
00:21:39,511 --> 00:21:44,312
I'm Francis Brown. We spoke, uh,
on the phone a couple of weeks ago.

169
00:21:44,383 --> 00:21:48,911
- Revenue Canada.
- Oh, uh, of course. Uh-

170
00:21:48,988 --> 00:21:53,049
- How was your trip?
- Oh, it was fine.

171
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:56,458
- And when did you get back?
- Um, just yesterday.

172
00:21:56,528 --> 00:21:59,463
Good weather?

173
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:03,092
Yes, yes, lovely. Yeah.

174
00:22:03,168 --> 00:22:06,001
- Is this a good time, Mr. Pinto?
- Oh, sure.

175
00:22:06,071 --> 00:22:10,565
- It's just that you seem a
little, uh- - A little what?

176
00:22:10,643 --> 00:22:13,237
- Flustered.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

177
00:22:13,312 --> 00:22:16,076
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

178
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:18,082
Good.

179
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:27,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen,
I can't talk to you right now. L-Later.

180
00:22:39,838 --> 00:22:42,238
Okay, uh-

181
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:02,492
- So this is where I'd find
all the bank s-statements? - Uh-

182
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:05,826
Yeah, that's right,
and those there.

183
00:23:09,268 --> 00:23:12,533
Okay. Well, if I have any questions,
I'll let you know.

184
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,633
- Is it a little hot for you back here?
- It's, uh, yeah.

185
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:20,941
You could turn it down a tad.

186
00:23:21,013 --> 00:23:26,542
I suppose you have to be pretty careful
with the temperature with the animals.

187
00:23:26,618 --> 00:23:29,212
Oh, well, they're a lot hardier
than you'd think.

188
00:23:31,957 --> 00:23:34,892
I wouldn't think
they're not hardy.

189
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,728
I mean, just because they're exotic
doesn't mean they can't endure extremes.

190
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,895
It is, after all,
a jungle out there, isn't it?

191
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,805
Um, so, how long
will this take?

192
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:55,040
- An audit?
- Yes.

193
00:23:55,114 --> 00:23:58,277
Well, it depends on
how prepared you are.

194
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:03,344
- Have you got an accountant? - Uh,
well, um, no- Well, no, not really, no.

195
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:06,414
Not really?

196
00:24:06,492 --> 00:24:10,019
- So this will take, uh, a while?
- I could be done by the end of the day.

197
00:24:10,095 --> 00:24:13,758
Or it might take a week.
It's difficult to say.

198
00:24:13,832 --> 00:24:19,327
- Oh. Okay. Uh, well, if you have any
questions, um- - I'll let you know.

199
00:24:56,275 --> 00:24:58,709
Did you know her?

200
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:03,045
Sort of.

201
00:25:03,115 --> 00:25:06,573
She was your neighbor?

202
00:25:06,652 --> 00:25:10,315
I, uh, I baby-sat her
a couple times.

203
00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:14,348
Oh, so you knew her
pretty well, eh?

204
00:25:14,426 --> 00:25:17,862
Yeah. I did.

205
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,864
What about you?

206
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:25,302
Oh, I just, uh, I heard this thing
was being organized, so-

207
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:28,362
It seems so, uh...

208
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,204
surreal, doesn't it?

209
00:25:31,276 --> 00:25:34,712
- What?
- That we'd find anything.

210
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:40,377
I mean, there's so, uh, many places you
could hide something in this country.

211
00:25:40,452 --> 00:25:45,219
- My name's Eric.
- I'm Christina.

212
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:48,259
Hey, nice to meet you,
Christina.

213
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,239
Well?

214
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:08,871
- Well, what?
- Don't you want to touch it?

215
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:15,812
You don't have to. It's one of
those things people normally like to do.

216
00:26:15,888 --> 00:26:18,618
Ah.

217
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:33,829
What is this thing about Eric
calling you "a sassy piece of jailbait"?

218
00:26:33,906 --> 00:26:37,501
- What's this thing?
- It bothers me.

219
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:40,943
- Why?
- It makes you out like a child or something.

220
00:26:41,013 --> 00:26:46,246
Unlike the tartan skirt and my socks
or the blouse or the way I act, right?

221
00:26:49,421 --> 00:26:53,755
Do you find it strange that he
would still want to work here?

222
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:59,422
Zoe, not all of us have the luxury
of deciding what to do with our lives.

223
00:26:59,498 --> 00:27:02,592
It's a job, and he's
getting paid all right.

224
00:27:02,668 --> 00:27:05,228
I just find it cruel.

225
00:27:05,304 --> 00:27:07,864
So fire him.

226
00:27:09,675 --> 00:27:12,838
As a favor.

227
00:27:12,911 --> 00:27:15,846
How can you be
so detached?

228
00:28:52,911 --> 00:28:55,471
Well, I'm finished for the day.

229
00:28:55,547 --> 00:28:59,745
Uh, for the day?
Uh, you mean you have to come back?

230
00:28:59,818 --> 00:29:02,685
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

231
00:29:02,754 --> 00:29:05,018
When is a good time?

232
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,558
But, but, I thought you said
it was only going to take one day.

233
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:10,356
Well, it can only take a day.

234
00:29:10,429 --> 00:29:14,263
But you have to understand, you don't
keep very well-organized books.

235
00:29:14,332 --> 00:29:16,823
That's why you should really think
about getting someone in to help you.

236
00:29:16,902 --> 00:29:20,099
Just somebody to come in
once or twice a week...

237
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:26,077
depending on the amount of activity
and... the type of activity.

238
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:29,136
Uh, what do you mean by that?

239
00:29:29,214 --> 00:29:32,377
Well, some types of activity
are more complicated, aren't they?

240
00:29:32,451 --> 00:29:35,420
It might take more effort
to account for.

241
00:29:35,487 --> 00:29:37,421
Oh.

242
00:29:37,489 --> 00:29:40,515
I found a gun
in one of the drawers.

243
00:29:40,592 --> 00:29:45,996
- Oh, well, that belonged to my dad.
- Your dad?

244
00:29:46,064 --> 00:29:50,296
Yeah, I guess he just kept it,
uh, just in case.

245
00:29:50,368 --> 00:29:55,135
- In case of what?
- Well, in case of trouble.

246
00:29:55,207 --> 00:29:57,505
With the animals?

247
00:30:01,413 --> 00:30:04,041
Would Monday be a good time
for me to come back...

248
00:30:04,116 --> 00:30:07,608
- Mr. Pinto?
- Oh, yeah.

249
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:09,711
Well, how about, uh, tomorrow?

250
00:30:09,788 --> 00:30:14,020
Uh, I have appointments for tomorrow.
Actually, I'm pretty busy 'til the end of the week.

251
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:16,151
Monday's not good?

252
00:30:16,228 --> 00:30:18,856
No, uh, Monday's fine.

253
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:21,296
- Around 10:00?
- Yeah, sure.

254
00:30:24,202 --> 00:30:26,830
Well, good.
Have a nice weekend.

255
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,467
Strange to think that bird
is probably going to outlive us.

256
00:30:58,537 --> 00:31:01,904
Strange?

257
00:31:01,973 --> 00:31:05,204
Did you ever teach it
to say anything?

258
00:31:05,277 --> 00:31:07,211
Yes.

259
00:31:10,348 --> 00:31:15,081
- What does it say, Harold?
- It doesn't really say it anymore.

260
00:31:15,153 --> 00:31:17,053
It forgot?

261
00:31:18,823 --> 00:31:23,817
I don't think so.
They're not supposed to forget.

262
00:31:23,895 --> 00:31:26,830
It must have just lost interest.

263
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:33,565
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- It's okay. We're just talking about Felix.

264
00:31:33,638 --> 00:31:36,004
What about him?

265
00:31:36,074 --> 00:31:38,406
Dad?

266
00:31:38,476 --> 00:31:43,277
I had the piano tuned.
It sounds beautiful.

267
00:32:09,307 --> 00:32:11,741
So, how does it sound?

268
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,574
- It's good.
- Yeah? Good, good.

269
00:32:14,646 --> 00:32:18,082
- Okay, well, I shouldn't be too late.
- What's "too late"?

270
00:32:18,149 --> 00:32:21,585
- Around 11:00 or so?
- Okay.

271
00:32:53,852 --> 00:32:57,117
You looking for tickets?

272
00:32:57,188 --> 00:32:59,884
Uh, yeah. How much?

273
00:34:06,124 --> 00:34:09,218
That's too hot.

274
00:34:31,216 --> 00:34:34,583
He comes in here every other night.

275
00:34:35,153 --> 00:34:38,919
He has his favorite drink...

276
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:43,586
at his favorite table
with his favorite dancer.

277
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:51,098
Sometimes he has to wait for her,
and sometimes she's waiting for him.

278
00:34:51,169 --> 00:34:55,606
She'll protect him.
She's his angel.

279
00:35:02,113 --> 00:35:06,209
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
it's show time at the Exotica.

280
00:35:06,284 --> 00:35:08,878
And just to remind you
that five dollars is all it takes...

281
00:35:08,953 --> 00:35:13,549
to have one of our lovely ladies
come over to your table...

282
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:18,562
and show you the mysteries
of their world.

283
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:36,873
Now if that didn't
turn you on, gentlemen, nothing will.

284
00:36:36,941 --> 00:36:42,573
Oh, let's have a nice, big, warm round
of applause for Christina, gentlemen!

285
00:36:42,647 --> 00:36:45,047
Yes, Christina!

286
00:37:07,272 --> 00:37:11,368
What are you thinking?

287
00:37:11,442 --> 00:37:15,879
I was just thinking,
what would happen if someone hurt you?

288
00:37:19,284 --> 00:37:23,550
H-How could anyone hurt me?

289
00:37:23,621 --> 00:37:28,718
If I'm not there
to protect you.

290
00:37:31,129 --> 00:37:36,590
I- You'll always
be there to protect me.

291
00:38:04,429 --> 00:38:07,523
An angel.

292
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,534
Shh.

293
00:38:15,273 --> 00:38:19,539
Why would somebody want
to do something like that?

294
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:26,717
How could somebody even think
of doing something like that?

295
00:38:26,784 --> 00:38:30,720
You mustn't worry.

296
00:38:46,471 --> 00:38:49,565
Eric! Eric!

297
00:38:49,641 --> 00:38:51,905
Oh.

298
00:38:51,976 --> 00:38:57,710
All hot and bothered, yes, indeed.

299
00:38:57,782 --> 00:39:03,243
Let's have a nice, big
round of applause for Melinda.

300
00:39:57,308 --> 00:40:01,745
Uh, listen, I feel bad about,
uh, taking your money.

301
00:40:01,813 --> 00:40:06,250
- Why?
- The tickets were given to me, and...

302
00:40:06,317 --> 00:40:09,252
I should have
given them away for free.

303
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,414
- Well, that would have been stupid.
- Why?

304
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:15,254
Because no one
gives anything away.

305
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:20,696
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, p-positive.

306
00:40:44,355 --> 00:40:48,291
Do you consider my dad a friend?

307
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:51,726
- Why?
- J-Just asking.

308
00:40:51,796 --> 00:40:54,629
Does he consider me a friend?

309
00:40:54,699 --> 00:40:57,634
I don't know.

310
00:40:57,702 --> 00:40:59,795
Why not?

311
00:40:59,871 --> 00:41:03,739
'Cause he always seems
different when you're around.

312
00:41:03,808 --> 00:41:08,142
- Different in what way?
- J- Tense.

313
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:12,415
Is that bad?

314
00:41:12,483 --> 00:41:16,749
Well, I don't really like
to feel tense around my friends.

315
00:41:16,821 --> 00:41:19,085
Well, sure, yeah.

316
00:41:19,157 --> 00:41:22,388
I didn't like to feel tense around
my friends when I was your age either.

317
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,759
But you do now?

318
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:29,391
No, it's not a question
of liking it or not.

319
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:33,096
It's just something that happens.

320
00:41:33,171 --> 00:41:35,435
Why?

321
00:41:37,008 --> 00:41:41,604
Um...

322
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:46,275
well... as you get older...

323
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:51,287
you become aware that the people
you meet and the person you are...

324
00:41:51,355 --> 00:41:55,553
um, as carrying
a certain amount of baggage.

325
00:41:55,626 --> 00:42:00,290
And, and that baggage
creates tension.

326
00:42:00,364 --> 00:42:03,731
So what do you do about it?

327
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:06,429
Well, you can pretend
it's not there...

328
00:42:06,504 --> 00:42:10,235
or you can choose
not to have friends...

329
00:42:10,308 --> 00:42:14,642
or you can acknowledge that
it's there and have friends anyway.

330
00:42:14,712 --> 00:42:17,078
Like my dad?

331
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:20,915
Right.

332
00:42:20,985 --> 00:42:25,217
I don't think that I like my dad
when he's around you.

333
00:42:27,825 --> 00:42:31,420
Hmm.

334
00:42:31,495 --> 00:42:33,588
Well, that's...

335
00:42:33,664 --> 00:42:38,260
because your dad doesn't like himself
when he's around me.

336
00:42:38,336 --> 00:42:40,270
But that's okay.

337
00:42:40,338 --> 00:42:44,206
That's... part of what friends do
to each other.

338
00:42:48,846 --> 00:42:50,939
- Good night.
- Good night.

339
00:43:18,709 --> 00:43:20,734
I, uh-
I just graduated.

340
00:43:20,811 --> 00:43:22,745
Really?
So did I.

341
00:43:22,813 --> 00:43:26,749
- Oh, yeah? In what?
- Radio communications.

342
00:43:26,817 --> 00:43:30,412
- So, so is that what you do?
- That's what I'd like to do.

343
00:43:30,488 --> 00:43:33,753
Uh, I do a little
freelance deejay stuff...

344
00:43:33,824 --> 00:43:36,918
but, you know, right now
I'm just driving a cab.

345
00:43:36,994 --> 00:43:40,760
- I thought you might do something like that.
- Drive a cab?

346
00:43:40,831 --> 00:43:45,768
- No, do something where, you use your voice.
- Why?

347
00:43:45,836 --> 00:43:50,705
I don't know why.
Because you're easy to listen to.

348
00:43:50,775 --> 00:43:54,267
Because of my voice, eh?

349
00:44:12,797 --> 00:44:16,893
I just need to find
a structure, you know?

350
00:44:16,968 --> 00:44:18,902
What do you mean?

351
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:23,566
Listen, I waste so much time, you know?
I just- My days just slip by, you know?

352
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:27,771
- Isn't that what days are supposed to do?
- Yeah.

353
00:44:27,845 --> 00:44:31,246
Not if you want to make
something of yourself, you know?

354
00:44:31,315 --> 00:44:35,411
- What do you
want to make of yourself?

355
00:44:35,486 --> 00:44:39,923
I don't know. I just feel that I was
meant to do something with my time.

356
00:44:39,991 --> 00:44:44,758
I mean, otherwise, I wouldn't be
thinking of this this way.

357
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:49,095
I'd be able to just
continue what I was doing, you know?

358
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:01,107
Do you have a lot of friends?

359
00:45:02,913 --> 00:45:06,849
Not really. Do you?

360
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:10,216
- No.
- Yeah.

361
00:45:10,287 --> 00:45:15,520
Do you ever feel like you need a friend?

362
00:45:15,593 --> 00:45:19,051
Yeah, sometimes.

363
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:22,190
When?

364
00:45:22,266 --> 00:45:24,860
Like right now.

365
00:45:24,935 --> 00:45:27,699
Why?

366
00:45:27,772 --> 00:45:30,866
'Cause I just met you and...

367
00:45:30,941 --> 00:45:34,377
I just feel like
telling someone, you know?

368
00:46:14,585 --> 00:46:18,681
No way.
No way, no way.

369
00:46:21,425 --> 00:46:23,518
- Hi.
- Hi.

370
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:26,688
- Jesus.
- What's the matter?

371
00:46:26,764 --> 00:46:29,995
"What's the matter?"
Her wigs, her clothes.

372
00:46:30,067 --> 00:46:34,197
Sometimes I just feel like
throwing them all away, you know?

373
00:46:34,271 --> 00:46:36,364
What are you looking for, Zoe?

374
00:46:41,946 --> 00:46:44,710
- I mean, is this where you see your future?
- My future?

375
00:46:46,784 --> 00:46:48,718
The club?

376
00:46:51,388 --> 00:46:56,883
When Mom died, my immediate idea was
to get rid of this place. Just sell it.

377
00:46:56,961 --> 00:47:02,126
- I never thought it would have any interest for me.
- So why did it?

378
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:11,003
I used to be very shy
as a child.

379
00:47:11,075 --> 00:47:13,669
I used to watch
my mother for hours...

380
00:47:13,744 --> 00:47:17,510
just admiring
her sense of freedom.

381
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:23,118
So when the opportunity came up,
I thought I would take on the challenge.

382
00:47:23,187 --> 00:47:28,056
So you feel better about adopting her
options rather than creating your own?

383
00:47:29,927 --> 00:47:32,088
I have created
my own options too.

384
00:47:32,163 --> 00:47:34,529
Oh, I know.

385
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:46,803
It's your contract
for the baby with Eric.

386
00:47:46,877 --> 00:47:49,243
I found it.

387
00:47:49,313 --> 00:47:52,373
Does he know?

388
00:47:52,449 --> 00:47:54,815
I would hope so.

389
00:47:54,885 --> 00:47:59,822
Otherwise he might just think I'm
disgusted with him for no particular reason.

390
00:48:02,059 --> 00:48:05,392
Look, I really desperately
needed this child...

391
00:48:05,462 --> 00:48:08,488
and it just worked out
with Eric.

392
00:48:08,566 --> 00:48:11,194
I didn't mean
to hurt you.

393
00:48:11,268 --> 00:48:14,897
You know, I remember
when your mother built this hallway.

394
00:48:14,972 --> 00:48:20,205
She, uh, she built it for this
very rich man who used to come here.

395
00:48:22,513 --> 00:48:26,005
He used to get off watching us dance for
other guys, so he actually paid her...

396
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:29,610
to construct this very special place
that he could watch us from.

397
00:48:31,388 --> 00:48:33,618
Your mother never
told us that.

398
00:48:33,691 --> 00:48:36,285
She said it was
to protect us...

399
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,295
so she could patrol things.

400
00:48:42,566 --> 00:48:44,693
And I believed her.

401
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:48,864
Until Eric told me the truth.

402
00:48:51,809 --> 00:48:53,743
Why did you believe him?

403
00:48:53,811 --> 00:48:56,211
I made a choice.

404
00:48:59,216 --> 00:49:03,812
And Eric promised me
he'd never lie to me.

405
00:49:45,763 --> 00:49:49,221
How could anyone...

406
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,734
hurt you?

407
00:49:56,273 --> 00:49:59,208
Take you away from me?

408
00:50:04,148 --> 00:50:06,776
How could anyone?

409
00:50:54,631 --> 00:50:57,600
What's this machine?

410
00:50:57,668 --> 00:51:00,603
Uh, uh, it's an incubator.

411
00:51:00,671 --> 00:51:05,438
- Wh-What's it for?
- Well, what do you think it's for?

412
00:51:05,509 --> 00:51:08,034
- Eggs.
- That's right.

413
00:51:08,112 --> 00:51:11,172
Are they yours?

414
00:51:11,248 --> 00:51:13,842
Wh-What do you mean?

415
00:51:13,917 --> 00:51:18,479
- I mean, shouldn't you be sitting on them or something?
- Oh, yeah.

416
00:51:18,555 --> 00:51:21,854
Well, I guess
I've abandoned the nest.

417
00:51:31,268 --> 00:51:36,365
What's inside of them?

418
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,536
- Uh, the eggs?
- Yes.

419
00:51:40,611 --> 00:51:43,205
Well, uh, Hyacinth Macaws...

420
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,147
if you want to know
the absolute truth.

421
00:51:46,216 --> 00:51:48,810
And where did you get them?

422
00:51:48,886 --> 00:51:54,654
From... very far away.

423
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:12,834
Hey, check her out, eh?

424
00:52:15,746 --> 00:52:18,943
I said check her out.

425
00:52:19,016 --> 00:52:23,180
- Yeah.
- You talking to me?

426
00:52:23,253 --> 00:52:27,189
Uh, yes,
I'm talking to you.

427
00:52:29,259 --> 00:52:31,523
What? Check who out?

428
00:52:31,595 --> 00:52:34,291
The babe that's dancing
for you, man.

429
00:52:34,364 --> 00:52:38,528
You've given her quite a run
for your money, man.

430
00:52:38,602 --> 00:52:41,366
What do you mean by that?

431
00:52:41,438 --> 00:52:45,465
- She's been dancing for you all night.
- Yeah.

432
00:52:45,542 --> 00:52:49,535
Yeah, and not just tonight. I mean, I've
noticed you with her other nights too.

433
00:52:52,549 --> 00:52:56,076
You come in here
all the time or-

434
00:52:56,153 --> 00:53:00,817
Uh... yeah.
All the time.

435
00:53:00,891 --> 00:53:05,487
This- Visuals, you know?
It's good.

436
00:53:05,562 --> 00:53:08,827
But, uh...

437
00:53:08,899 --> 00:53:13,734
she seems to have a bit
of a thing for you, doesn't she?

438
00:53:15,572 --> 00:53:19,133
We, uh... get along.

439
00:53:19,209 --> 00:53:23,339
I'm sure you do, my friend.

440
00:53:23,413 --> 00:53:27,179
What do you two
talk about, huh?

441
00:53:27,251 --> 00:53:32,848
Oh, just, uh...
the usual, I guess.

442
00:53:32,923 --> 00:53:34,857
The usual?

443
00:53:34,925 --> 00:53:39,862
I don't think you're talking
about what I would call "usual. "

444
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:42,694
- Why not?
- Because I can tell.

445
00:53:42,766 --> 00:53:46,293
You get pretty intense,
my friend.

446
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:48,895
Well, I guess that's
just the way I am.

447
00:53:52,543 --> 00:53:57,810
So, uh- Hey, wh-why don't you
give her a little touch, huh?

448
00:53:57,881 --> 00:54:03,649
- You're not supposed to touch.
- Ah, but she is into it, believe me.

449
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,985
Yeah.

450
00:54:07,057 --> 00:54:12,495
- How do you know?
- Everybody knows, man.

451
00:54:12,563 --> 00:54:15,293
Trust me, my friend.

452
00:54:15,365 --> 00:54:19,324
Trust me.
Just a little touch.

453
00:54:19,403 --> 00:54:23,499
Nothing too drastic.

454
00:54:23,574 --> 00:54:27,840
Then you will get
the full experience, my friend...

455
00:54:27,911 --> 00:54:30,471
and you will love it.

456
00:54:30,547 --> 00:54:35,007
You will love it. Okay?

457
00:54:35,085 --> 00:54:39,749
And what happens
when I touch her?

458
00:54:39,823 --> 00:54:44,351
What happens?

459
00:55:19,896 --> 00:55:23,593
You're outta here, man!
Get out!

460
00:55:26,903 --> 00:55:29,667
Come on.
Get down there.

461
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:32,402
Come on. Go.

462
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,753
Hey, what the hell you doin'?
Get off the road!

463
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,163
Move!

464
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:21,455
What's so funny?

465
00:56:21,525 --> 00:56:24,619
It's like pettin' a gorilla.

466
00:56:24,695 --> 00:56:27,460
Well-

467
00:56:27,531 --> 00:56:30,467
Was your father this hairy?

468
00:56:30,534 --> 00:56:34,631
No, I, uh, I got it
from my mother.

469
00:56:34,705 --> 00:56:37,140
I mean, I mean,
from my mother's side of the family.

470
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:42,976
That's where you, um,
inherit hair patterns.

471
00:56:43,047 --> 00:56:47,917
- My uncle's bald.
- On your mother's side?

472
00:56:47,986 --> 00:56:50,420
Mm-hmm.

473
00:56:50,489 --> 00:56:54,254
Well, um, I guess I'm talking
about usual patterns.

474
00:56:54,325 --> 00:56:58,763
- Hmm.
- There's always exceptions.

475
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:01,423
That's-

476
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:06,938
That's the way these things... work.

477
00:57:17,849 --> 00:57:20,682
Shouldn't you go
to the hospital?

478
00:57:20,751 --> 00:57:23,777
No, I'm fine.

479
00:57:23,855 --> 00:57:27,790
You don't look fine.

480
00:57:27,858 --> 00:57:31,158
You worry about me, don't you?

481
00:57:31,229 --> 00:57:35,289
You think this is normal?

482
00:57:35,367 --> 00:57:39,599
- What?
- What we do.

483
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:44,405
What do we do?

484
00:57:46,477 --> 00:57:49,310
That's just it.
We don't speak about it.

485
00:57:49,381 --> 00:57:55,251
You know that feeling
you get sometimes, Tracey...

486
00:57:55,319 --> 00:57:58,550
that you didn't ask to be
brought into the world?

487
00:58:00,324 --> 00:58:02,258
Yeah.

488
00:58:04,162 --> 00:58:06,357
Well, then who did?

489
00:58:06,431 --> 00:58:08,591
What?

490
00:58:08,667 --> 00:58:11,032
If you think that
you didn't ask...

491
00:58:11,103 --> 00:58:15,038
to be brought
into the world...

492
00:58:15,107 --> 00:58:17,667
then who did?

493
00:58:31,823 --> 00:58:36,954
All I'm saying is nobody asked you if
you wanted to be brought into the world.

494
00:58:37,027 --> 00:58:40,464
You just ended up getting here.

495
00:58:42,533 --> 00:58:46,561
So the question is,
now that you're here...

496
00:58:46,638 --> 00:58:50,574
who's asking you to stay?

497
00:59:01,152 --> 00:59:04,087
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

498
00:59:04,156 --> 00:59:07,454
Look, are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

499
00:59:07,526 --> 00:59:10,426
Yes.

500
00:59:10,495 --> 00:59:12,485
Good night.

501
00:59:17,669 --> 00:59:19,603
Good night.

502
00:59:28,413 --> 00:59:30,437
- He touched you?
- He didn't want to.

503
00:59:30,514 --> 00:59:33,507
- What do you mean?
- I know him.

504
00:59:33,585 --> 00:59:38,579
- We all know him. He's crazy about you.
- Not like that.

505
00:59:38,657 --> 00:59:40,818
Why didn't you get one of the boys
to handle this, Eric?

506
00:59:40,891 --> 00:59:44,122
Because I didn't think of it.

507
00:59:44,195 --> 00:59:46,663
I just saw him touch her, and-

508
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:48,722
Why didn't you
ask him to leave?

509
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,995
- Because he wouldn't have listened.
- How do you know that?

510
00:59:51,068 --> 00:59:54,061
Because he's in his own world,
the ass-wipe.

511
00:59:54,139 --> 00:59:56,334
I don't know
where you're both coming from.

512
00:59:56,407 --> 01:00:00,742
You are telling me that he touched you,
but he really didn't.

513
01:00:00,812 --> 01:00:04,339
And you're saying that you overreacted,
but you didn't have a choice?

514
01:00:04,415 --> 01:00:08,182
- I didn't.
- Why not?

515
01:00:08,252 --> 01:00:13,714
Why not?
Because he touched you.

516
01:00:13,791 --> 01:00:17,091
Okay.

517
01:00:17,161 --> 01:00:19,790
All I'm concerned about
is if he makes a case...

518
01:00:19,863 --> 01:00:23,594
I have to know
what happened.

519
01:00:23,668 --> 01:00:25,726
We told you
what happened, Zoe.

520
01:00:25,803 --> 01:00:28,932
And that is
what happened?

521
01:00:34,178 --> 01:00:37,637
- Yeah.
- Okay.

522
01:00:37,716 --> 01:00:40,582
Is that it?

523
01:00:43,521 --> 01:00:45,613
Hi. This is Thomas.

524
01:00:45,689 --> 01:00:47,954
I am not in at the present time,
but I am in town.

525
01:00:48,026 --> 01:00:52,793
Please leave a message
following the beep.

526
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,956
Good morning.

527
01:00:55,033 --> 01:00:59,469
You're probably not up yet,
so you haven't seen what I've done.

528
01:00:59,536 --> 01:01:03,132
I'm a customs officer
at the airport.

529
01:01:03,207 --> 01:01:08,305
Actually, I saw you the other day when
you were having your bags inspected.

530
01:01:08,379 --> 01:01:12,315
I know- I know how you probably
smuggled those eggs in.

531
01:01:12,384 --> 01:01:17,151
There's a special unit at work. I think
they give them to the zoo or something.

532
01:01:17,221 --> 01:01:22,158
They asked me where I got them.
I had to lie.

533
01:01:22,226 --> 01:01:24,161
Where are they?

534
01:01:24,228 --> 01:01:26,822
- I took them.
- Where?

535
01:01:26,898 --> 01:01:29,832
- I'd like to see you again.
- Oh, no.

536
01:01:29,901 --> 01:01:32,699
Uh, no, they're in the country now.
Uh, they're definitely in the country.

537
01:01:32,771 --> 01:01:36,673
It's just I don't have them, uh, with me
presently, but it doesn't mean I can't get them.

538
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:40,005
- And if you can give me, like,
uh, just, uh, um, a couple-

539
01:01:40,077 --> 01:01:43,172
- Good morning.
- Hi. Uh, and, uh, I'm here. Okay.

540
01:01:43,247 --> 01:01:46,274
So I'll call-
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

541
01:01:46,351 --> 01:01:48,785
You look like you're
in worse shape than I am.

542
01:01:48,853 --> 01:01:51,947
Uh... what happened to you?

543
01:01:52,023 --> 01:01:54,786
Oh, I fell down
some stairs and-

544
01:01:54,858 --> 01:01:58,454
- Are you okay?
- Well, do I look okay?

545
01:01:58,529 --> 01:02:02,966
- Uh, no, not really.
- Well, I'm better than I look. Here, I got you a coffee.

546
01:02:03,033 --> 01:02:05,798
I didn't, uh-
I didn't know how you took it.

547
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:08,134
- Oh, black's fine.
- Oh.

548
01:02:08,206 --> 01:02:11,300
- Uh, I added cream.
- Oh, that's okay.

549
01:02:11,375 --> 01:02:15,141
- No, here, have mine. No, I insist.
- No, really-

550
01:02:18,716 --> 01:02:20,810
What is it?

551
01:02:20,884 --> 01:02:24,980
Well, it's just that
this has cream in it too.

552
01:02:25,055 --> 01:02:27,649
It's milk.

553
01:02:27,726 --> 01:02:30,490
Oh. Oh, good.

554
01:02:30,562 --> 01:02:32,495
Okay, well, I'll, uh-

555
01:02:32,564 --> 01:02:35,499
I'll get to work.

556
01:03:19,877 --> 01:03:22,471
Mmm, what?

557
01:03:22,547 --> 01:03:24,980
What is it?

558
01:03:25,048 --> 01:03:29,644
What is it that gives a schoolgirl
her special innocence?

559
01:03:31,389 --> 01:03:35,324
Is it the way they smell?

560
01:03:35,392 --> 01:03:40,329
The sweet smell
of their perfume, of their hair?

561
01:03:40,398 --> 01:03:44,891
The aroma
of fresh flowers...

562
01:03:44,968 --> 01:03:46,937
and all that other stuff
that hasn't been fucked up...

563
01:03:47,004 --> 01:03:50,440
by late nights
and a lot of bad food.

564
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:59,112
Is it their gestures...
and the way they move?

565
01:03:59,184 --> 01:04:04,281
The way their body still holds on
to some semblance of self-respect and...

566
01:04:04,355 --> 01:04:08,120
and dignity?

567
01:04:08,192 --> 01:04:12,459
When they wrap
their beautiful legs around you...

568
01:04:12,529 --> 01:04:16,466
tight and holding on,
looking at you...

569
01:04:16,533 --> 01:04:18,467
you looking at them.

570
01:04:18,535 --> 01:04:21,801
It's just-

571
01:04:21,873 --> 01:04:24,636
Or is it whatever comes out
of their cute little mouths?

572
01:04:24,708 --> 01:04:28,144
All those questions,
all that wondering that-

573
01:04:33,217 --> 01:04:37,813
It's just, you know, you
- They got their whole lives ahead of them, you know?

574
01:04:37,889 --> 01:04:41,325
And you've wasted
half of yours away.

575
01:04:41,392 --> 01:04:43,326
Damn.

576
01:04:45,062 --> 01:04:47,155
What is it?

577
01:04:49,667 --> 01:04:52,760
There's this feeling
I get sometimes, you know?

578
01:04:52,836 --> 01:04:55,431
What sort of feeling?

579
01:04:55,506 --> 01:05:00,443
That I wasn't ever meant
to be satisfied.

580
01:05:00,511 --> 01:05:03,605
Satisfied with what?

581
01:05:03,681 --> 01:05:06,115
A lot of things.

582
01:05:06,183 --> 01:05:08,618
I mean, it seems to me
that every time I'm about to...

583
01:05:08,686 --> 01:05:13,123
you know, get a hold
of something or someone...

584
01:05:13,191 --> 01:05:18,457
it's just bound
to slip away.

585
01:05:18,529 --> 01:05:21,124
Maybe you want it
to slip away.

586
01:05:21,198 --> 01:05:24,463
Maybe I want what
to slip away?

587
01:05:24,535 --> 01:05:29,633
The things that you think
you're about to have.

588
01:05:29,706 --> 01:05:33,472
What would you
think about that?

589
01:05:33,544 --> 01:05:36,639
As a general philosophy...

590
01:05:36,713 --> 01:05:38,977
or how it pertains to you?

591
01:05:39,049 --> 01:05:42,144
You think you could talk
about how it pertains to me?

592
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:44,653
What do you mean?

593
01:05:44,721 --> 01:05:48,749
Well, I feel
like I want you.

594
01:05:48,826 --> 01:05:53,923
Do you think that means
you'll slip away?

595
01:05:59,671 --> 01:06:02,366
Dad?

596
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:07,206
I'm not going to baby-sit
for Uncle Francis anymore.

597
01:06:07,278 --> 01:06:10,441
Baby-sit?
You go there to practice.

598
01:06:10,514 --> 01:06:13,779
That's absurd.

599
01:06:13,851 --> 01:06:16,250
Why?

600
01:06:16,321 --> 01:06:21,623
Dad, he pretends
I'm still baby-sitting for him.

601
01:06:21,692 --> 01:06:24,126
Why would you think that?

602
01:06:24,195 --> 01:06:26,163
Because he's paying me.

603
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:29,096
To house-sit.

604
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:35,429
Twenty dollars an hour?

605
01:06:35,505 --> 01:06:38,907
When did it go up?

606
01:06:38,976 --> 01:06:41,809
He wants to believe
that Lisa's still there.

607
01:06:41,879 --> 01:06:44,938
I make it easier for him
to convince himself.

608
01:06:47,652 --> 01:06:52,088
Francis always had strange ways
to convince himself...

609
01:06:52,155 --> 01:06:55,091
of many things.

610
01:06:55,158 --> 01:07:00,927
Things that never happened,
things that might happen.

611
01:07:00,999 --> 01:07:06,596
People who did things
for reasons, but they didn't.

612
01:07:08,673 --> 01:07:13,110
What has any of this
got to do with me, Dad?

613
01:07:16,179 --> 01:07:19,615
Nothing.

614
01:07:19,683 --> 01:07:22,778
Nothing at all.

615
01:07:22,854 --> 01:07:26,789
So why do I have
to keep going there?

616
01:07:26,857 --> 01:07:29,121
You don't.

617
01:07:29,192 --> 01:07:31,626
And you'll tell him?

618
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:40,961
I was in here the other night
when that guy was thrown out.

619
01:07:41,038 --> 01:07:45,737
Why did that happen?
Has he ever been thrown out before?

620
01:07:45,809 --> 01:07:49,905
- Why do you think he would touch you?
- Why do you think he would touch you?

621
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:53,075
Why do you think
he would touch you?

622
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:56,745
Well, what do you think
was going through his mind when he-

623
01:07:56,821 --> 01:08:00,416
Or-Or what was he thinking?

624
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:03,085
- Well-
- What's so funny?

625
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,095
Well, this is a joke, right?

626
01:08:05,163 --> 01:08:07,427
Not at all.

627
01:08:07,498 --> 01:08:12,230
If you do this favor for me,
I'll do that favor for you.

628
01:08:15,338 --> 01:08:18,000
But I'm not hiding anything.

629
01:08:18,076 --> 01:08:22,375
Thomas, you're hiding
a smuggling operation...

630
01:08:22,447 --> 01:08:27,441
that brings in over $200,000 a year,
probably a lot more.

631
01:08:27,518 --> 01:08:29,543
We've suspected you
for a long time.

632
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:33,111
I was just brought in to confirm
what was already known.

633
01:08:33,191 --> 01:08:35,682
So how do you want me
to report back?

634
01:08:39,529 --> 01:08:43,192
All I'm asking
for is a bit of help.

635
01:08:43,267 --> 01:08:45,827
That's all.

636
01:08:45,903 --> 01:08:50,465
It's very important for me to know these
things. Just ask her these questions.

637
01:08:50,541 --> 01:08:54,807
Do this for me,
and you have a clean slate.

638
01:08:54,879 --> 01:09:00,681
This really hasn't been my day.

639
01:09:00,751 --> 01:09:05,188
So change things.
Make it your day.

640
01:09:07,325 --> 01:09:09,759
And all you men sitting
near that stage, I can see you.

641
01:09:09,827 --> 01:09:11,919
I know what you're thinking.

642
01:09:11,995 --> 01:09:15,260
You're thinking that "because I'm
sitting next to that stage...

643
01:09:15,332 --> 01:09:18,096
I'm getting the same feeling
as all those guys...

644
01:09:18,168 --> 01:09:22,105
shoveling out that cash
for their own private dancer. "

645
01:09:22,173 --> 01:09:26,269
Well, you know, you guys want
to watch, go to the movies.

646
01:09:26,344 --> 01:09:29,107
We're in the live-action
business here, gents.

647
01:09:29,179 --> 01:09:34,947
And, okay, granted
- Granted, that beautiful creature writhing before you on stage...

648
01:09:35,019 --> 01:09:38,112
she maybe, you know,
smiles at you.

649
01:09:38,188 --> 01:09:40,123
She winks her eyes at you
occasionally...

650
01:09:40,191 --> 01:09:42,455
and you may feel
like the man.

651
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:44,518
Is that all you guys
are looking for?

652
01:09:44,595 --> 01:09:48,553
Is that all you want?
Come on, come on.

653
01:09:48,633 --> 01:09:52,568
Invite one of our lovely ladies over
to your table where the real action is.

654
01:09:52,636 --> 01:09:55,230
- Yeah!
- Hi.

655
01:09:55,306 --> 01:09:57,899
I'm really sorry that took so long,
or I took so long.

656
01:09:57,975 --> 01:10:00,067
- Hi.
- It's such a busy night.

657
01:10:00,144 --> 01:10:03,078
Hi. I'm Chrissy.

658
01:10:03,147 --> 01:10:05,910
Hi. I'm Thomas.

659
01:10:05,982 --> 01:10:10,419
It's nice to meet you, Thomas.
I like the name Thomas a lot.

660
01:10:10,487 --> 01:10:12,422
Oh, thanks.

661
01:10:12,490 --> 01:10:14,582
Are you from out of town?

662
01:10:14,658 --> 01:10:16,592
Yes.

663
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:18,924
Where are you from?

664
01:10:18,995 --> 01:10:23,091
Um... San Francisco.

665
01:10:23,167 --> 01:10:25,931
Oh, you're kidding.
I love San Francisco.

666
01:10:26,003 --> 01:10:28,596
Oh, you've-
You've been there?

667
01:10:28,673 --> 01:10:33,940
Yeah, I was there a couple of years ago
with my debating team.

668
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:36,104
- Debating team?
- Mm-hmm.

669
01:10:36,179 --> 01:10:39,946
Um, that's- I admire
someone who can debate well.

670
01:10:40,017 --> 01:10:43,110
I mean, who can debate
instead of just argue.

671
01:10:43,187 --> 01:10:47,624
Well, anyone can argue, but it's
a good skill, uh, discipline...

672
01:10:47,692 --> 01:10:50,456
to be able to debate
and stand back.

673
01:10:50,528 --> 01:10:53,793
Um, and that's something
you can apply in your life...

674
01:10:53,865 --> 01:10:56,129
- outside of school.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

675
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:59,134
And, and when you're meeting
someone or negotiating.

676
01:10:59,202 --> 01:11:03,639
- Negotiating?
- Well, I mean, if you have... If you have to...

677
01:11:03,707 --> 01:11:08,644
Um, it's a good skill to learn,
as opposed to cheerleading or-

678
01:11:08,712 --> 01:11:10,647
Well, that's what I say.

679
01:11:10,715 --> 01:11:13,149
Don't be nervous
about this, Thomas.

680
01:11:13,216 --> 01:11:16,653
- We're gonna have some fun, okay?
- Sure.

681
01:11:16,721 --> 01:11:19,315
Sure.

682
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:36,496
Um... um...

683
01:11:36,573 --> 01:11:40,840
I was here
the other night, um-

684
01:11:40,912 --> 01:11:42,846
What night was that?

685
01:11:42,913 --> 01:11:46,110
The night th-that guy
was thrown out.

686
01:11:46,182 --> 01:11:48,447
You were dancing for him.

687
01:11:48,519 --> 01:11:51,453
His name is Francis.

688
01:11:51,522 --> 01:11:54,047
Um... what happened?

689
01:11:58,696 --> 01:12:01,630
He was a bad boy.

690
01:12:01,698 --> 01:12:06,567
- Wh-What do you mean by that?
- What do I mean?

691
01:12:06,636 --> 01:12:09,663
I mean, have you danced
for him before a lot?

692
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:11,673
Mm-hmm.

693
01:12:11,741 --> 01:12:14,870
-And has he ever been thrown out before?
-No.

694
01:12:14,946 --> 01:12:17,106
So what do you
think happened?

695
01:12:17,181 --> 01:12:20,308
He touched me.

696
01:12:20,384 --> 01:12:23,318
And when you're dancing
for the customer...

697
01:12:23,386 --> 01:12:26,150
they can't touch.

698
01:12:26,222 --> 01:12:29,056
Yes, but why do you think
he touched you last night?

699
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:31,855
Has he ever touched you before?

700
01:12:31,928 --> 01:12:34,989
Is this what you really want to talk
about for five bucks a dance, Thomas?

701
01:12:35,066 --> 01:12:39,264
Well, I just want to know
what you think was going on in his mind.

702
01:12:39,336 --> 01:12:42,703
Are you here for some kind
of psychology conference?

703
01:12:42,773 --> 01:12:46,606
Uh, well, uh, yes.

704
01:12:46,677 --> 01:12:49,441
Uh, I am, actually.

705
01:12:49,512 --> 01:12:52,448
He's, uh-

706
01:12:52,516 --> 01:12:55,780
He's a very particular case.

707
01:12:55,853 --> 01:12:59,117
Particular in what way?

708
01:13:01,858 --> 01:13:06,125
Um...
you want the full story?

709
01:13:06,196 --> 01:13:10,497
Sure.

710
01:13:15,205 --> 01:13:18,174
His daughter was murdered
a couple of years ago...

711
01:13:18,241 --> 01:13:21,803
and then he was implicated.

712
01:13:21,878 --> 01:13:24,472
- For th-the murder?
- Yeah.

713
01:13:24,548 --> 01:13:29,815
- But why?
- I don't know. I don't really remember the details.

714
01:13:29,886 --> 01:13:32,980
I mean, he was cleared, and then
they caught the guy who did it.

715
01:13:33,057 --> 01:13:37,323
But... it obviously had,
like, this...

716
01:13:37,394 --> 01:13:39,328
this incredible effect on him.

717
01:13:39,396 --> 01:13:42,662
I mean, he is-

718
01:13:42,732 --> 01:13:46,759
He's just so fucked up about it.

719
01:13:46,836 --> 01:13:48,770
Oh.

720
01:13:51,008 --> 01:13:55,104
You know...

721
01:13:55,179 --> 01:13:58,114
Thomas...

722
01:13:58,182 --> 01:14:02,846
Francis and I have
a very special type of relationship.

723
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:06,116
And I've never-
I've never minded.

724
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:09,625
But then he chose
to violate it.

725
01:14:09,692 --> 01:14:12,457
S-Special in what way?

726
01:14:18,202 --> 01:14:22,969
Well, we've, we've always
had this understanding.

727
01:14:23,039 --> 01:14:26,134
I mean, I need him
for certain things...

728
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:29,144
and... he needs me
for certain things.

729
01:14:29,212 --> 01:14:31,646
I mean, that's the way it's been.

730
01:14:31,714 --> 01:14:34,980
Uh, and how did he
violate that?

731
01:14:35,051 --> 01:14:40,819
He-He violated that in his-his, in his
role and what he was supposed to do for me.

732
01:14:40,891 --> 01:14:43,382
Wh-What's he su- Why?

733
01:14:43,461 --> 01:14:46,692
What's he supposed to do for you? I
mean, he comes to this club. He pays you.

734
01:14:46,763 --> 01:14:50,597
Because I was
doing things for him...

735
01:14:50,667 --> 01:14:53,660
and he's done things
for me.

736
01:14:57,007 --> 01:15:00,271
What has he done for you?

737
01:15:00,344 --> 01:15:03,278
I'm-

738
01:15:03,346 --> 01:15:06,782
I'm sorry.

739
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:11,913
Okay, this is really stupid.

740
01:15:11,989 --> 01:15:17,790
And then I'm getting so emotional
over the fact that he touched me...

741
01:15:17,862 --> 01:15:22,127
because, I mean, he was,
he was always paying me...

742
01:15:22,199 --> 01:15:25,292
to do him this favor and-

743
01:15:25,368 --> 01:15:27,303
- What favor?
- I don't know, Thomas.

744
01:15:27,371 --> 01:15:31,307
- Why do you want to know all this?
- Well, I'm sorry, but I, uh-

745
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:35,868
What is it about a schoolgirl that gives
her that special innocence, gentlemen?

746
01:15:35,945 --> 01:15:39,972
Such a thing that you have
absolutely no control over.

747
01:15:40,049 --> 01:15:43,644
You never have.

748
01:15:43,721 --> 01:15:47,817
And you never will.

749
01:15:47,892 --> 01:15:51,088
- After this break, we'll be right back with sweet Chrissy...
- He not supposed to do that.

750
01:15:51,162 --> 01:15:53,096
- who'll help us answer that question.
- Do what?

751
01:15:53,163 --> 01:15:55,097
He's not supposed to-
He's not suppose-

752
01:15:55,165 --> 01:15:57,930
He can obviously see from his booth that
I'm sitting here talking with a client.

753
01:15:58,001 --> 01:16:00,766
He's not supposed to call me
when I'm talking with a client.

754
01:16:00,837 --> 01:16:04,773
Why? Do you have to go now?

755
01:16:06,176 --> 01:16:08,111
Uh, yeah.

756
01:16:08,179 --> 01:16:12,275
But I want to come back,
and I want to, you know, talk.

757
01:16:12,348 --> 01:16:16,285
But I want to move downstairs.
I don't like it here.

758
01:16:16,353 --> 01:16:18,287
Sure, sure, sure.

759
01:16:18,355 --> 01:16:21,551
Okay. I'll see you soon.

760
01:16:28,365 --> 01:16:33,701
Uh, I'm going to move
to the washroom.

761
01:17:01,664 --> 01:17:06,602
Hey, I've noticed you've been spending
a lot of time with that lady.

762
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:09,104
Are you- Are you talking to me?

763
01:17:09,173 --> 01:17:11,436
Yeah.

764
01:17:11,508 --> 01:17:15,842
You seem, uh, to, to both
hit it off together.

765
01:17:15,913 --> 01:17:18,438
- Well, I guess.
- Yeah.

766
01:17:18,515 --> 01:17:20,675
Um, I guess
that can happen.

767
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:24,949
So what do you guys talk about?

768
01:17:25,021 --> 01:17:28,458
Oh, just things.

769
01:17:28,525 --> 01:17:32,290
What sort of things?

770
01:17:32,363 --> 01:17:34,297
Oh, this and that.

771
01:17:34,365 --> 01:17:36,696
"This and that," eh?

772
01:17:36,767 --> 01:17:40,794
You know, it's amazing how...

773
01:17:40,871 --> 01:17:45,398
you can hit it off with someone
like that, isn't it?

774
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:54,076
Have you ever noticed that
some people just drift into your life...

775
01:17:54,151 --> 01:17:57,951
like you've
known them forever?

776
01:17:58,021 --> 01:18:00,923
I mean, there are some people
that you can remember...

777
01:18:00,990 --> 01:18:05,758
the moment that you met them
really clearly.

778
01:18:05,828 --> 01:18:08,923
And other people that...

779
01:18:08,999 --> 01:18:14,767
it seems like you've known them forever,
even though you haven't.

780
01:18:14,837 --> 01:18:19,605
And they all become part of this
continuous memory you have of yourself.

781
01:18:19,676 --> 01:18:23,442
This ongoing-

782
01:18:23,513 --> 01:18:25,448
Are you with me?

783
01:18:25,516 --> 01:18:29,111
Uh, yeah, I think so.

784
01:18:29,185 --> 01:18:31,119
I mean, here you are,
y-you know...

785
01:18:31,188 --> 01:18:33,452
you're having this beautiful
conversation with her.

786
01:18:33,523 --> 01:18:38,621
You're getting to know
each other, and-

787
01:18:38,695 --> 01:18:42,961
I mean, there's other guys
that come in here.

788
01:18:43,032 --> 01:18:46,901
There's this one guy who comes in here
every other night or something...

789
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:51,066
and he spends
a few hours with her.

790
01:18:51,141 --> 01:18:53,575
But he never really
gets to know her, you know?

791
01:18:53,644 --> 01:18:58,080
Not the way you have.
Not the way you two-

792
01:19:01,484 --> 01:19:06,080
She really seems
to be herself with you.

793
01:19:08,491 --> 01:19:11,426
Well, how do you know?

794
01:19:13,497 --> 01:19:16,260
What? That she's being herself?

795
01:19:16,333 --> 01:19:19,426
Yeah.

796
01:19:19,502 --> 01:19:24,440
Because I used to be her lover.

797
01:19:24,508 --> 01:19:28,273
I'm, uh, sorry, sir.
I can't let you in.

798
01:19:28,345 --> 01:19:30,778
Look, why not?

799
01:19:32,348 --> 01:19:35,943
Look, can I... Can I at least
just talk to the manager?

800
01:19:36,019 --> 01:19:40,217
- You want to talk to the manager?
- Yeah.

801
01:19:40,289 --> 01:19:44,124
You have to understand that
we have very strict rules...

802
01:19:44,193 --> 01:19:46,719
regarding
this sort of behavior here.

803
01:19:46,797 --> 01:19:50,392
- And I have always respected them.
- And this one time you didn't.

804
01:19:50,467 --> 01:19:53,230
Now, the problem, Mr. Brown,
is that this one time...

805
01:19:53,303 --> 01:19:57,398
happened in a room full
of other men who were watching.

806
01:19:57,473 --> 01:19:59,738
Now, if I let you
back into the club...

807
01:19:59,809 --> 01:20:03,746
- what's to stop them from trying to do the same thing?
- I told you.

808
01:20:03,814 --> 01:20:06,907
Someone told me to do it.
I was set up.

809
01:20:06,983 --> 01:20:11,579
And you believed that someone?

810
01:20:11,654 --> 01:20:15,750
This is, uh, Security.
- Please, sit down.

811
01:20:15,826 --> 01:20:17,759
Thank you.

812
01:20:19,997 --> 01:20:23,432
Why did you touch her?

813
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:27,230
- Well, I needed to make sure.
- Why?

814
01:20:27,304 --> 01:20:30,329
What if she let you?
What would you have done?

815
01:20:30,406 --> 01:20:32,932
I'd have been disappointed.

816
01:20:34,510 --> 01:20:38,446
I'm not sure...
I understand you.

817
01:20:38,515 --> 01:20:41,882
That's not the way
she was raised.

818
01:20:41,952 --> 01:20:44,511
You know her?
Personally?

819
01:20:46,522 --> 01:20:50,288
There is another club
I can recommend.

820
01:20:50,359 --> 01:20:52,452
I need to come here.

821
01:20:52,528 --> 01:20:57,090
- I understand that very well.
- No, I don't think you understand.

822
01:20:57,166 --> 01:21:00,796
Exotica is a special place.

823
01:21:00,871 --> 01:21:05,467
My mother was dedicated to creating
a very particular type of atmosphere...

824
01:21:05,541 --> 01:21:08,704
and I would like
to maintain that.

825
01:21:08,778 --> 01:21:12,407
You don't understand.

826
01:21:15,219 --> 01:21:20,452
Mr. Brown, we're all aware
of what you've gone through.

827
01:21:20,523 --> 01:21:23,321
You've suffered a lot.

828
01:21:23,393 --> 01:21:28,490
But you have to understand
that Exotica is here for your amusement.

829
01:21:28,565 --> 01:21:32,092
We're here to entertain,
not to heal.

830
01:21:32,169 --> 01:21:35,501
There are other places for that.

831
01:21:38,407 --> 01:21:40,342
Other places?

832
01:21:40,410 --> 01:21:44,506
I can give you a list.

833
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:46,605
Mr. Brown?

834
01:21:46,682 --> 01:21:48,741
Are you listening to me,
Mr. Brown?

835
01:22:02,365 --> 01:22:05,130
Um...

836
01:22:05,202 --> 01:22:10,640
um, I just met this man
in the washroom.

837
01:22:10,707 --> 01:22:12,641
What man?

838
01:22:12,709 --> 01:22:14,643
Well, I'm not sure.
I was in a booth.

839
01:22:14,711 --> 01:22:17,144
I didn't really have
a chance to see him.

840
01:22:17,213 --> 01:22:21,309
- So how did you meet him?
- He just started talking to me.

841
01:22:21,384 --> 01:22:23,478
And what did he say?

842
01:22:23,554 --> 01:22:28,490
Well, um, he said
he used to be your lover.

843
01:22:28,558 --> 01:22:31,789
Well, it's always
a sad moment, gentlemen...

844
01:22:31,862 --> 01:22:36,821
when that clock
strikes that magic hour...

845
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:42,497
and we have to send you out
into the long and dark and lonely night.

846
01:22:44,575 --> 01:22:47,942
But just remember...

847
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:52,448
we're only ever
just a dream away...

848
01:22:52,516 --> 01:22:55,279
wherever that is.

849
01:23:13,369 --> 01:23:16,305
- I guess-
- I have to go.

850
01:23:17,874 --> 01:23:20,307
Oh, okay.

851
01:23:20,376 --> 01:23:22,971
Um, wait a minute.

852
01:23:23,046 --> 01:23:27,642
- Oh, no. Thomas, don't.
- No, no, no.

853
01:23:27,718 --> 01:23:32,484
- Thomas, please, don't.
- Uh... no, no. Uh, I insist.

854
01:23:32,556 --> 01:23:34,648
Please.

855
01:23:36,058 --> 01:23:38,152
Thank you.

856
01:23:46,702 --> 01:23:49,262
Your dad told me about, um...

857
01:23:49,338 --> 01:23:52,933
you not wanting
to baby-sit anymore.

858
01:23:53,009 --> 01:23:56,776
There's no baby to sit.

859
01:23:59,516 --> 01:24:03,281
Well, I just want you
to know, I understand.

860
01:24:03,353 --> 01:24:06,788
Understand what?

861
01:24:06,856 --> 01:24:11,225
That this might all seem
a little weird.

862
01:24:11,294 --> 01:24:14,626
A little?

863
01:24:16,032 --> 01:24:21,198
- I just want to thank you, Tracey.
- For what?

864
01:24:25,709 --> 01:24:28,803
You've been very patient.

865
01:24:28,878 --> 01:24:32,315
And, uh...

866
01:24:32,382 --> 01:24:36,818
if you think the time has come
for this to end, then I understand.

867
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:47,428
Thank you.

868
01:24:47,497 --> 01:24:49,931
Good night, Francis.

869
01:25:10,554 --> 01:25:13,614
He-He-He calls me from a table to dance.
Of course I expect you to do something.

870
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:16,625
- Christina- - And then- And then he
follows this guy to the washroom...

871
01:25:16,692 --> 01:25:19,627
- and he tells this guy that, that he was my lover.
- Well, he was.

872
01:25:19,695 --> 01:25:22,460
It's going too far, Zoe.

873
01:25:22,531 --> 01:25:27,469
Actually, baby, you have
no idea how far it's gone.

874
01:25:27,537 --> 01:25:30,131
You know, I told him to touch you.

875
01:25:30,207 --> 01:25:34,007
I said you were into it. Yeah.

876
01:25:34,077 --> 01:25:39,480
It used to be wonderful watching you dance
for him, seeing how you could soothe him.

877
01:25:40,884 --> 01:25:43,818
I mean, it soothed me.

878
01:25:43,886 --> 01:25:47,084
You know, you soothed me.

879
01:25:47,156 --> 01:25:49,147
Do you understand that?

880
01:25:52,496 --> 01:25:54,759
- Hey, hey.
- Don't, don't, don't!

881
01:25:54,830 --> 01:25:58,767
- Stop. Stop that!
- Don't fucking touch me, you fucker!

882
01:25:58,835 --> 01:26:01,429
- Stop!
- Just fuck off, Zoe!

883
01:26:01,505 --> 01:26:05,099
- Stop it when I say! Eric!
- Stop it! Ow!

884
01:26:05,174 --> 01:26:07,108
Chill out! Chill out!

885
01:26:07,176 --> 01:26:09,770
Chill out! Relax!

886
01:26:09,846 --> 01:26:12,440
- All right? Relax!
- Eric, come here!

887
01:26:12,516 --> 01:26:17,282
- John! Get out. What's the matter?
- No!

888
01:26:17,354 --> 01:26:20,618
Fuck off, Zoe! No!

889
01:26:45,048 --> 01:26:47,982
Morning, Thomas.

890
01:26:48,050 --> 01:26:51,577
- What happened?
- I had to leave.

891
01:26:51,654 --> 01:26:54,214
Did you, uh, hear everything?

892
01:26:54,290 --> 01:26:57,259
Yeah.

893
01:26:57,327 --> 01:26:59,921
Did you know?

894
01:26:59,996 --> 01:27:02,088
Did I know what?

895
01:27:02,164 --> 01:27:06,100
That she knew...
about your daughter.

896
01:27:17,012 --> 01:27:21,450
You know, when the,
when the police came to question me...

897
01:27:21,518 --> 01:27:25,284
they told me
a lot of things.

898
01:27:25,355 --> 01:27:29,791
They told me that my wife
was having an affair with my brother;

899
01:27:29,859 --> 01:27:32,795
had been for years.

900
01:27:32,863 --> 01:27:37,196
They told me that I thought
Lisa wasn't my daughter.

901
01:27:38,868 --> 01:27:42,134
They told me
I thought she was Harold's.

902
01:27:42,204 --> 01:27:44,263
Wh-Why would they say that?

903
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:48,903
Because they thought
I could harm her...

904
01:27:48,979 --> 01:27:53,746
that I would harm her.

905
01:27:53,817 --> 01:27:59,585
And then they found the man
that, uh, that did it.

906
01:27:59,655 --> 01:28:03,422
Let me go.

907
01:28:03,492 --> 01:28:07,588
And I went home.

908
01:28:10,333 --> 01:28:14,598
And then my wife was killed
in a car accident a couple months later.

909
01:28:14,671 --> 01:28:19,438
And, uh, Harold was in the car.

910
01:28:21,176 --> 01:28:24,237
He lived.

911
01:28:45,301 --> 01:28:47,394
What do you think
it would have taken...

912
01:28:47,470 --> 01:28:50,905
for your father
to kill someone?

913
01:28:50,973 --> 01:28:55,740
I'm asking because there's
someone that I want to kill now.

914
01:28:55,811 --> 01:29:01,250
I felt it last night
as I listened to him in the washroom.

915
01:29:01,317 --> 01:29:03,411
I don't understand.

916
01:29:03,486 --> 01:29:07,422
He set me up...
to touch her.

917
01:29:07,490 --> 01:29:09,583
Why would he do that?

918
01:29:09,659 --> 01:29:14,255
He took something
very special from me.

919
01:29:14,330 --> 01:29:18,426
I've had too many
special things taken away.

920
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:23,438
- That's why we have to go back tonight.
- To kill him?

921
01:29:23,506 --> 01:29:26,599
- What would you do, Thomas?
What would you do? - Well-

922
01:29:26,675 --> 01:29:29,941
- Well, I would talk to him.
- I can't even get in there.

923
01:29:30,012 --> 01:29:32,948
What would you do?

924
01:29:33,016 --> 01:29:36,452
You go back tonight...

925
01:29:36,519 --> 01:29:39,113
and you have her
dance for you...

926
01:29:39,189 --> 01:29:42,056
and then you touch her.

927
01:29:42,125 --> 01:29:44,787
And he'll throw you out
just like he threw me out.

928
01:29:44,861 --> 01:29:47,385
But I'll be waiting outside
with the gun.

929
01:29:47,463 --> 01:29:50,490
I'm not gonna
help you kill somebody.

930
01:29:50,567 --> 01:29:53,832
Not even to save
a few years in prison?

931
01:29:53,903 --> 01:29:56,133
No.

932
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:00,904
Well, to help me then?

933
01:30:06,149 --> 01:30:09,584
And that was Mirella, gentlemen.
Mirella.

934
01:30:09,651 --> 01:30:13,087
You can have her at your own table
for only five dollars.

935
01:30:13,156 --> 01:30:15,419
Thank you, Mirella.

936
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:22,756
And now, it's always a pleasure
to announce to you our next dancer.

937
01:30:22,832 --> 01:30:26,928
Gentlemen, please, let's give
a big round of applause...

938
01:30:27,002 --> 01:30:32,202
for Christina.

939
01:34:00,015 --> 01:34:03,611
Don't be afraid.

940
01:34:03,685 --> 01:34:06,211
I know everything about you.

941
01:34:06,288 --> 01:34:10,225
What do you know about me?

942
01:34:12,528 --> 01:34:16,258
I found her.

943
01:34:16,332 --> 01:34:20,267
You found who?

944
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:28,134
Your little girl.

945
01:34:29,379 --> 01:34:32,314
Oh. Oh.

946
01:34:55,337 --> 01:34:57,533
I found her, man.

947
01:35:01,511 --> 01:35:03,444
I found her.

948
01:36:06,008 --> 01:36:09,944
Yeah, play something happy.
Play something happy.

949
01:36:10,011 --> 01:36:11,979
Yeah. Hello.

950
01:36:14,517 --> 01:36:16,950
Okay, I'll get it,
I'll get it, I'll get it.

951
01:36:23,692 --> 01:36:26,127
- Hi, Christina.
- Hi.

952
01:36:26,194 --> 01:36:31,462
- I'm a little bit early.
- Yeah, th-that's okay. Come on in.

953
01:36:36,439 --> 01:36:38,964
Yeah, I mean,
it's difficult for me to tell...

954
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:41,805
'cause I never had much
of a musical education myself...

955
01:36:41,877 --> 01:36:44,971
but her teacher thinks
she's really talented.

956
01:36:45,046 --> 01:36:49,073
And, um, actually, we were thinking
of buying her a better piano.

957
01:36:49,151 --> 01:36:52,087
An exotic baby grand,
you know?

958
01:36:52,154 --> 01:36:54,419
And when I mentioned "baby grand,"
do you know what she said to me?

959
01:36:54,490 --> 01:36:58,926
She said, "Dad,
isn't that a contradiction in terms?"

960
01:36:58,995 --> 01:37:01,758
I mean, she just never
ceases to amaze me.

961
01:37:01,830 --> 01:37:03,765
I mean, she's eight years old.
Can you imagine?

962
01:37:03,832 --> 01:37:06,529
She can already identify-
Wh-What do you call that when...

963
01:37:06,602 --> 01:37:09,935
it's two words,
kind of cancel each other out?

964
01:37:10,006 --> 01:37:14,272
Oh, she just amazes me.

965
01:37:16,345 --> 01:37:21,111
Where's your mind?

966
01:37:21,183 --> 01:37:24,620
I was just thinking.

967
01:37:24,687 --> 01:37:27,952
About what?

968
01:37:28,024 --> 01:37:32,120
About the way
you talk about Lisa.

969
01:37:32,194 --> 01:37:34,788
You get so excited.

970
01:37:34,863 --> 01:37:38,799
It's nice.

971
01:37:40,203 --> 01:37:43,933
Well, I'm sure your parents
talk about you that way too.

972
01:37:44,006 --> 01:37:47,066
I don't think so.

973
01:37:47,142 --> 01:37:50,908
Oh, I do.

974
01:37:50,979 --> 01:37:53,073
Why?

975
01:37:53,149 --> 01:37:57,415
Because you're a very
responsible young woman.

976
01:37:57,486 --> 01:38:01,924
Responsible to what?

977
01:38:01,991 --> 01:38:06,758
Well, to whatever it is
you believe you have to do.

978
01:38:06,828 --> 01:38:10,924
Like what?

979
01:38:10,999 --> 01:38:16,836
Well, Lisa loves it when you
come over to baby-sit, for example.

980
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:22,774
She says you really
listen to her.

981
01:38:22,845 --> 01:38:25,779
That's nice.

982
01:38:25,848 --> 01:38:28,544
She really listens
to me too.

983
01:38:34,524 --> 01:38:37,584
She thinks you're not very happy.

984
01:38:37,660 --> 01:38:43,120
Listen, Christina,

985
01:38:43,198 --> 01:38:47,397
if there's, if there's ever anything
you want to talk about...

986
01:38:47,470 --> 01:38:50,997
about what might be going on
at home or whatever...

987
01:38:51,073 --> 01:38:55,908
you know that I'm here, okay?

988
01:38:57,812 --> 01:39:00,406
- Okay.
- Okay?

989
01:39:00,482 --> 01:39:02,575
Okay.

990
01:39:07,823 --> 01:39:11,417
Okay.

991
01:39:16,665 --> 01:39:19,897
Oh, no.
It's okay.

992
01:39:23,004 --> 01:39:25,098
Thank you.

993
01:39:32,515 --> 01:39:36,042
You know, I really enjoy
these drives home, Mr. Brown.

994
01:39:36,118 --> 01:39:39,609
Good, good.
So do I.

995
01:39:42,691 --> 01:39:45,558
- Bye, Mr. Brown.
- Good-bye.

996
