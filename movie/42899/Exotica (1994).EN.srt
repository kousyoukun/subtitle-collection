1
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,764
You have to ask yourself...

2
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:12,431
what brought the person to this point.

3
00:02:12,506 --> 00:02:18,001
What was seen in his face,
his manner, that channeled him here.

4
00:02:18,078 --> 00:02:21,138
You have to convince yourself...

5
00:02:21,215 --> 00:02:26,482
that this person has something
hidden that you have to find.

6
00:02:26,553 --> 00:02:31,650
You check his bags,
but it's his face...

7
00:02:31,725 --> 00:02:35,491
his gestures that
you're really watching.

8
00:02:38,432 --> 00:02:40,457
Thank you.

9
00:02:58,485 --> 00:03:00,919
He's staring straight at you.

10
00:03:00,988 --> 00:03:03,752
Look at him, carefully.

11
00:03:03,824 --> 00:03:06,122
What do you see?

12
00:03:06,193 --> 00:03:10,493
Security 4 to Baggage Claim 17.

13
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,609
- Where you headed?
- Downtown.

14
00:03:27,514 --> 00:03:31,108
- You want to split it?
- S-Sure.

15
00:03:43,362 --> 00:03:47,230
What? Not tonight.
Are you sure?

16
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,598
Well, can't you cancel?

17
00:04:01,714 --> 00:04:06,481
What are these?

18
00:04:06,552 --> 00:04:09,214
Ballet tickets for tonight.

19
00:04:12,225 --> 00:04:17,094
- You don't like ballet?
- Well, some ballets.

20
00:04:17,163 --> 00:04:19,893
Well, that's exactly
what this is: Some ballet.

21
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:22,901
Look, you can always scalp
the tickets at the door.

22
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:26,097
You mean,
take these in exchange...

23
00:04:26,172 --> 00:04:30,233
- for you paying your part of the fare.
- Well, what do you think?

24
00:04:51,297 --> 00:04:53,561
- See ya, John.
- Good night, John.

25
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:55,567
- See you guys.
- See ya.

26
00:05:18,324 --> 00:05:20,918
Christina, here you are.
Hurry and get dressed.

27
00:05:20,993 --> 00:05:23,086
- People are asking for you.
- * Exotica *

28
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,555
- She's right over there. I'll get her.
- * Exotica *

29
00:05:50,623 --> 00:05:52,648
Bye.

30
00:05:57,296 --> 00:05:57,796
Yeah!

31
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:04,075
Let's bring those big, hairy
palms together, gentlemen...

32
00:06:04,136 --> 00:06:06,331
and have a nice,
big round of applause...

33
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:08,737
for Kali!

34
00:06:08,808 --> 00:06:10,742
Kali.

35
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,744
Yes, indeed. Kali.

36
00:06:12,812 --> 00:06:15,576
And you, too, can-You, too,
can have Kali come over to your table...

37
00:06:15,648 --> 00:06:19,413
for only five dollars, where she can
show you the mysteries of her world.

38
00:06:19,484 --> 00:06:24,148
Trust me, gentlemen. Trust me.

39
00:07:10,869 --> 00:07:13,394
Baby, baby, baby!

40
00:07:13,471 --> 00:07:18,568
Do it for me, baby!

41
00:07:18,643 --> 00:07:24,411
My God, that's incredible.
That's incredible.

42
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:26,916
Let me ask you something, gentlemen.

43
00:07:26,985 --> 00:07:31,081
What is it that gives a
schoolgirl her special innocence?

44
00:07:31,156 --> 00:07:36,924
Her sweet fragrance? Fresh flowers...
light as a spring rain?

45
00:07:36,995 --> 00:07:39,429
Oh, my God. My God.

46
00:07:39,497 --> 00:07:42,091
Or is it her firm, young flesh
inviting your every caress...

47
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:44,601
enticing you to explore...

48
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:49,902
her deepest and most private secrets?

49
00:07:49,974 --> 00:07:55,037
Well, gentlemen, I'm gonna let you
decide that one for yourselves.

50
00:07:55,113 --> 00:07:58,378
Please join me in welcoming a sassy...

51
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:02,386
bit of jailbait to our stage.

52
00:08:02,454 --> 00:08:06,891
Yes, indeed.

53
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,722
Come out, sweet Chrissy.

54
00:08:09,794 --> 00:08:12,388
Wherever you are, baby,
come on out.

55
00:09:28,806 --> 00:09:33,573
You think you're bad, baby?

56
00:09:35,144 --> 00:09:36,943
You're bad.

57
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:57,099
That will be $5.50.

58
00:10:02,704 --> 00:10:05,771
Thank you.

59
00:11:33,864 --> 00:11:37,356
- Eric?
- What?

60
00:11:37,434 --> 00:11:41,803
Linda finished her dance.

61
00:11:41,872 --> 00:11:45,638
Let's bring those big, hairy
palms together, gentlemen.

62
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:49,805
Give it up.
Yeah, gentlemen. Yes.

63
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,215
Have a nice, big round
of applause for Linda. Yeah.

64
00:11:55,284 --> 00:11:58,185
Yes, indeed, Linda.

65
00:11:58,254 --> 00:12:00,484
And just a reminder that there is
nothing Linda would love more...

66
00:12:00,556 --> 00:12:02,922
than to slink over to your table and...

67
00:12:02,992 --> 00:12:07,258
give you your own private
show for only five dollars.

68
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,264
That's right.

69
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:13,393
Five dollars is all it takes to
have one of our beautiful foxes...

70
00:12:13,469 --> 00:12:16,768
come over to your table and
get you all hot and bothered.

71
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:19,603
But, hey, why be bothered...

72
00:12:19,675 --> 00:12:23,941
when you're being treated like a king?

73
00:12:24,013 --> 00:12:28,609
You've had a rough day.

74
00:12:28,684 --> 00:12:31,915
Don't you think you owe it
to yourselves to...

75
00:12:31,988 --> 00:12:35,822
do something that'll make you
feel like you're someone special?

76
00:12:37,893 --> 00:12:42,227
You are someone special.

77
00:12:42,298 --> 00:12:46,758
Five dollars is all
it takes to prove it.

78
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:31,377
Yes, let's have a nice big
round of applause for Michelle.

79
00:13:31,447 --> 00:13:34,610
My God, that was beautiful.

80
00:13:36,652 --> 00:13:39,143
Baby, you come out.

81
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:42,657
And just to remind you that there's
nothing Michelle would love more...

82
00:13:42,725 --> 00:13:45,406
than to come over to your table and
give you your own private dance.

83
00:13:47,396 --> 00:13:50,388
Hello, gentlemen!

84
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:52,400
Anybody out there?
Anybody alive?

85
00:13:52,468 --> 00:13:55,266
Anybody, for five dollars,
you can have Kali.

86
00:13:55,337 --> 00:13:59,467
Kali at your own private table.

87
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,414
Let me ask you something, gentlemen.

88
00:14:06,482 --> 00:14:08,712
What is it about a schoolgirl...

89
00:14:08,784 --> 00:14:12,242
that gives her that special innocence?

90
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:18,453
Is it the way that
they can gaze at you...

91
00:14:18,527 --> 00:14:22,588
waiting for you to say something
with so much expectation and hope...

92
00:14:22,665 --> 00:14:27,261
that you're just...
you're just paralyzed into...

93
00:14:28,971 --> 00:14:32,338
into silence?

94
00:15:22,223 --> 00:15:26,717
- Look, I want to give this back to you.
- Why?

95
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:29,559
Well, you see,
those tickets were given to me...

96
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:34,398
and I just feel uncomfortable
about having sold them.

97
00:15:34,469 --> 00:15:37,438
- That's okay.
- No, no, no, really, I...

98
00:15:41,843 --> 00:15:44,778
We never really introduced ourselves.
I'm Thomas.

99
00:15:44,846 --> 00:15:46,780
David.

100
00:15:46,848 --> 00:15:49,214
Can I use this
to take you out for a drink?

101
00:15:49,284 --> 00:15:54,153
- That's very kind of you, but...
- But what?

102
00:15:54,222 --> 00:15:58,056
But I really have to get home.

103
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,028
Thanks.

104
00:16:41,102 --> 00:16:43,036
Are you available next Thursday?

105
00:16:43,104 --> 00:16:45,095
- I think so, yeah.
- Good, good.

106
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:49,874
- Tracey?
- Yeah?

107
00:16:49,944 --> 00:16:52,208
I'm not that boring, am I?

108
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,216
- What do you mean?
- Well, the earphones.

109
00:16:56,284 --> 00:16:58,980
I mean, we used to listen
to the radio...

110
00:16:59,053 --> 00:17:03,012
and you used to ask me
all sorts of questions.

111
00:17:03,091 --> 00:17:05,787
So you want me to ask more questions?

112
00:17:07,462 --> 00:17:11,159
Sure. Yeah, I mean, if there's
something y-you want to know.

113
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:14,731
Okay. I'll see
what I can think up.

114
00:17:14,802 --> 00:17:16,827
- Say hi to your dad.
- I will.

115
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:18,839
- Good night.
- Good night.

116
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:43,194
- Did someone say something?
- No.

117
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:45,458
So, what's the point?

118
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:48,865
I've just noticed
a change in your attitude.

119
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,501
Look, I would understand if you would
prefer not to introduce Christina.

120
00:17:56,576 --> 00:18:01,013
I could do it myself.

121
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:03,413
Actually, I've been thinking
that, perhaps...

122
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:07,817
I should be getting more involved
in the introductions overall.

123
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:13,121
I could have my own microphone,
like my mother used to do.

124
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:16,492
No, I mean, I actually
enjoy introducing Christina.

125
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:19,191
I mean, I find it
very therapeutic, you know?

126
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:23,327
- That's not what you're getting paid for.
- Well, it seems to me...

127
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:27,635
that I'm being paid to make every girl seem
like she's something special, right?

128
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:32,907
So, in order to do that,
I have to let my imagination run wild.

129
00:18:34,982 --> 00:18:38,543
So, I mean, when it comes
to Christina, I, you know...

130
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,314
My imagination is bound
to run a little wilder.

131
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:44,118
There's nothing that I can
do to control that, Zoe.

132
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:46,853
Makes the clients uncomfortable.

133
00:18:46,927 --> 00:18:49,623
And you think your state
puts them at ease?

134
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:01,307
Hey.

135
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,206
Is he kicking?

136
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:09,715
All the time.

137
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:15,114
Do you feel like touching it?

138
00:19:36,143 --> 00:19:40,477
How are you feeling about this?

139
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:44,074
- Fine.
- Fine?

140
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:46,779
Are you happy?

141
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,980
For you.

142
00:19:51,892 --> 00:19:55,089
What about you, Eric?
What about you?

143
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,630
Well, I guess I got to be pretty
careful about my feelings, right?

144
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:02,966
I mean...

145
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:07,097
that's why we have
a contract, isn't it?

146
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,205
There's plaster dust
all over the apartment.

147
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:19,115
No, I'm not exaggerating. No, I was
coughing in my sleep last night.

148
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:22,279
You told me that it was going to be
comfortable for me to live there...

149
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,447
and it is not comfortable.

150
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,457
There's plastic on the furniture.

151
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,619
That is not comfortable living.

152
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:32,755
Yeah. Oh, come on, look.

153
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:36,996
You told me you were going to strip the
wallpaper, not strip the walls down.

154
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,004
Well, no, if you'd,
if you'd told me in the first place...

155
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,563
If you'd told me what kind of job it was,
then I would have considered it.

156
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:46,975
Although, it's-it makes me seem
like you've maybe made a mistake.

157
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:50,140
That's what it makes me suspect.

158
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:55,150
What? No, it's too late now.
It's inaccessible.

159
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:58,190
I'm not gonna pay you. Pay you for what?
You didn't do the job.

160
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:02,455
Well, you did a job, but it's not
the job that I asked you to do.

161
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:05,292
It's not the job we agreed on.

162
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:08,595
Well, I can get anyone,
any number of people to do this.

163
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:12,660
Yeah, that's just fine with me.

164
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:19,439
Yeah, can I help you?

165
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,973
- Mr. Pinto?
- Yes.

166
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:27,849
I'm Francis Brown. We spoke
on the phone a couple of weeks ago.

167
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,448
- Revenue Canada.
- Oh, of course.

168
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:36,586
- How was your trip?
- It was fine.

169
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,995
- And when did you get back?
- Just yesterday.

170
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:43,000
Good weather?

171
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:46,629
Yes, yes, lovely. Yeah.

172
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,538
- Is this a good time, Mr. Pinto?
- Oh, sure.

173
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:54,102
- It's just that you seem a little...
- A little what?

174
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,774
- Flustered.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

175
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:59,613
I'm fine. I'm fine.

176
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,619
Good.

177
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:08,311
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

178
00:22:08,312 --> 00:22:11,127
Listen, I can't talk to you right now.
L-Later.

179
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,775
Okay.

180
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:45,558
So this is where I'd find
all the bank statements?

181
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:49,363
Yeah, that's right,
and those there.

182
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:56,070
Okay. Well, if I have any questions,
I'll let you know.

183
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:00,169
- Is it a little hot for you back here?
- It's, yeah.

184
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:04,477
You could turn it down a tad.

185
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:10,078
I suppose you have to be pretty careful
with the temperature with the animals.

186
00:23:10,154 --> 00:23:12,748
Well, they're a lot hardier
than you'd think.

187
00:23:15,493 --> 00:23:18,428
I wouldn't think they're not hardy.

188
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:24,264
I mean, just because they're exotic
doesn't mean they can't endure extremes.

189
00:23:24,335 --> 00:23:28,431
It is, after all,
a jungle out there, isn't it?

190
00:23:32,076 --> 00:23:35,341
So, how long will this take?

191
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:38,576
- An audit?
- Yes.

192
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,813
Well, it depends on
how prepared you are.

193
00:23:41,886 --> 00:23:43,785
Have you got an accountant?

194
00:23:43,786 --> 00:23:46,880
Well, no.
Well, no, not really, no.

195
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,950
Not really?

196
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:53,555
- So this will take a while?
- I could be done by the end of the day.

197
00:23:53,631 --> 00:23:57,294
Or it might take a week.
It's difficult to say.

198
00:23:57,368 --> 00:24:01,372
Okay. Well,
if you have any questions...

199
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:02,863
I'll let you know.

200
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,245
Did you know her?

201
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:46,581
Sort of.

202
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:50,109
She was your neighbor?

203
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:53,851
I... I baby-sat her
a couple times.

204
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:57,884
So you knew her pretty well?

205
00:24:57,962 --> 00:25:01,398
Yeah. I did.

206
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,400
What about you?

207
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:08,838
I just... I heard this
thing was being organized, so...

208
00:25:08,906 --> 00:25:11,898
It seems so...

209
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:14,740
surreal, doesn't it?

210
00:25:14,812 --> 00:25:18,248
- What?
- That we'd find anything.

211
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:23,913
I mean, there's so many places you
could hide something in this country.

212
00:25:23,988 --> 00:25:28,755
- My name's Eric.
- I'm Christina.

213
00:25:28,826 --> 00:25:31,795
Hey, nice to meet you, Christina.

214
00:25:45,475 --> 00:25:48,774
Well?

215
00:25:48,845 --> 00:25:52,406
- Well, what?
- Don't you want to touch it?

216
00:25:54,284 --> 00:25:59,347
You don't have to. It's one of those
things people normally like to do.

217
00:26:11,835 --> 00:26:17,364
What is this thing about Eric calling
you "a sassy piece of jailbait"?

218
00:26:17,441 --> 00:26:21,036
- What's this thing?
- It bothers me.

219
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:21,952
Why?

220
00:26:21,953 --> 00:26:24,478
It makes you out like
a child or something.

221
00:26:24,548 --> 00:26:29,781
Unlike the tartan skirt and my socks
or the blouse or the way I act, right?

222
00:26:32,956 --> 00:26:37,290
Do you find it strange that he
would still want to work here?

223
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,957
Zoe, not all of us have the luxury of
deciding what to do with our lives.

224
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:46,127
It's a job, and he's
getting paid all right.

225
00:26:46,203 --> 00:26:48,763
I just find it cruel.

226
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:51,399
So fire him.

227
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,373
As a favor.

228
00:26:56,446 --> 00:26:59,381
How can you be so detached?

229
00:28:36,445 --> 00:28:39,005
Well, I'm finished for the day.

230
00:28:39,081 --> 00:28:43,279
For the day?
You mean you have to come back?

231
00:28:43,352 --> 00:28:46,219
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

232
00:28:46,288 --> 00:28:48,552
When is a good time?

233
00:28:48,624 --> 00:28:51,104
But, but, I thought you said it
was only going to take one day.

234
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,890
Well, it can only take a day.

235
00:28:53,963 --> 00:28:57,797
But you have to understand, you don't
keep very well-organized books.

236
00:28:57,866 --> 00:29:00,357
That's why you should really think
about getting someone in to help you.

237
00:29:00,436 --> 00:29:03,633
Just somebody to come in
once or twice a week...

238
00:29:03,706 --> 00:29:09,611
depending on the amount of activity
and... the type of activity.

239
00:29:09,678 --> 00:29:12,670
What do you mean by that?

240
00:29:12,748 --> 00:29:15,911
Well, some types of activity are
more complicated, aren't they?

241
00:29:15,985 --> 00:29:18,954
It might take more effort
to account for.

242
00:29:21,023 --> 00:29:24,049
I found a gun in one of the drawers.

243
00:29:24,126 --> 00:29:29,530
- Well, that belonged to my dad.
- Your dad?

244
00:29:29,598 --> 00:29:33,830
Yeah, I guess he just kept it,
just in case.

245
00:29:33,902 --> 00:29:38,669
- In case of what?
- Well, in case of trouble.

246
00:29:38,741 --> 00:29:41,039
With the animals?

247
00:29:44,947 --> 00:29:47,575
Would Monday be a good time
for me to come back...

248
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:51,142
- Mr. Pinto?
- Oh, yeah.

249
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,245
Well, how about tomorrow?

250
00:29:53,322 --> 00:29:55,143
I have appointments for tomorrow.

251
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:57,554
Actually, I'm pretty
busy 'til the end of the week.

252
00:29:57,626 --> 00:29:59,685
Monday's not good?

253
00:29:59,762 --> 00:30:02,390
No, Monday's fine.

254
00:30:02,464 --> 00:30:04,830
- Around 10:00?
- Yeah, sure.

255
00:30:07,736 --> 00:30:10,364
Well, good.
Have a nice weekend.

256
00:30:39,134 --> 00:30:42,001
Strange to think that bird is
probably going to outlive us.

257
00:30:42,071 --> 00:30:45,438
Strange?

258
00:30:45,507 --> 00:30:48,738
Did you ever teach it to say anything?

259
00:30:48,811 --> 00:30:50,745
Yes.

260
00:30:53,882 --> 00:30:58,615
- What does it say, Harold?
- It doesn't really say it anymore.

261
00:30:58,687 --> 00:31:00,587
It forgot?

262
00:31:02,357 --> 00:31:07,351
I don't think so.
They're not supposed to forget.

263
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:10,364
It must have just lost interest.

264
00:31:13,368 --> 00:31:17,099
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- It's okay. We're just talking about Felix.

265
00:31:17,172 --> 00:31:19,537
What about him?

266
00:31:19,607 --> 00:31:21,939
Dad?

267
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:26,810
I had the piano tuned.
It sounds beautiful.

268
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,274
So, how does it sound?

269
00:31:55,343 --> 00:31:58,107
- It's good.
- Yeah? Good, good.

270
00:31:58,179 --> 00:32:01,615
- Okay, well, I shouldn't be too late.
- What's "too late"?

271
00:32:01,682 --> 00:32:05,118
- Around 11:00 or so?
- Okay.

272
00:32:37,385 --> 00:32:40,650
You looking for tickets?

273
00:32:40,721 --> 00:32:43,417
Yeah. How much?

274
00:33:49,657 --> 00:33:52,751
That's too hot.

275
00:34:14,748 --> 00:34:18,115
He comes in here every other night.

276
00:34:18,685 --> 00:34:22,451
He has his favorite drink...

277
00:34:22,522 --> 00:34:27,118
at his favorite table
with his favorite dancer.

278
00:34:28,862 --> 00:34:34,630
Sometimes he has to wait for her,
and sometimes she's waiting for him.

279
00:34:34,701 --> 00:34:39,138
She'll protect him.
She's his angel.

280
00:34:45,645 --> 00:34:49,741
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
it's show time at the Exotica.

281
00:34:49,816 --> 00:34:52,410
And just to remind you that
five dollars is all it takes...

282
00:34:52,485 --> 00:34:57,081
to have one of our lovely ladies
come over to your table...

283
00:34:57,157 --> 00:35:02,094
and show you the mysteries
of their world.

284
00:36:16,002 --> 00:36:20,405
Now if that didn't turn you
on, gentlemen, nothing will.

285
00:36:20,473 --> 00:36:26,105
Let's have a nice, big, warm round
of applause for Christina, gentlemen!

286
00:36:26,179 --> 00:36:28,579
Yes, Christina!

287
00:36:50,804 --> 00:36:54,899
What are you thinking?

288
00:36:54,973 --> 00:36:59,410
I was just thinking,
what would happen if someone hurt you?

289
00:37:02,815 --> 00:37:07,081
H-How could anyone hurt me?

290
00:37:07,152 --> 00:37:12,249
If I'm not there to protect you.

291
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:20,121
I- You'll always be there to protect me.

292
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,054
An angel.

293
00:37:58,804 --> 00:38:03,070
Why would somebody want
to do something like that?

294
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:10,248
How could somebody even think
of doing something like that?

295
00:38:10,315 --> 00:38:14,251
You mustn't worry.

296
00:38:30,002 --> 00:38:33,096
Eric! Eric!

297
00:38:35,507 --> 00:38:41,241
All hot and bothered, yes, indeed.

298
00:38:41,313 --> 00:38:46,774
Let's have a nice, big
round of applause for Melinda.

299
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:45,275
Listen, I feel bad about,
taking your money.

300
00:39:45,343 --> 00:39:49,780
- Why?
- The tickets were given to me, and...

301
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:52,782
I should have given them away for free.

302
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:55,944
- Well, that would have been stupid.
- Why?

303
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,784
Because no one gives anything away.

304
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:04,226
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, p-positive.

305
00:40:27,885 --> 00:40:31,821
Do you consider my dad a friend?

306
00:40:31,889 --> 00:40:35,256
- Why?
- J-Just asking.

307
00:40:35,326 --> 00:40:38,159
Does he consider me a friend?

308
00:40:38,229 --> 00:40:41,164
I don't know.

309
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:43,325
Why not?

310
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:47,269
'Cause he always seems
different when you're around.

311
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:51,672
- Different in what way?
- J-Tense.

312
00:40:54,011 --> 00:40:55,945
Is that bad?

313
00:40:56,013 --> 00:41:00,279
Well, I don't really like to
feel tense around my friends.

314
00:41:00,351 --> 00:41:02,615
Well, sure, yeah.

315
00:41:02,687 --> 00:41:05,918
I didn't like to feel tense around my
friends when I was your age either.

316
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:09,289
But you do now?

317
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,921
No, it's not a question
of liking it or not.

318
00:41:12,997 --> 00:41:16,626
It's just something that happens.

319
00:41:16,701 --> 00:41:18,965
Why?

320
00:41:25,209 --> 00:41:29,805
Well... as you get older...

321
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,817
you become aware that the people
you meet and the person you are...

322
00:41:34,885 --> 00:41:39,083
as carrying
a certain amount of baggage.

323
00:41:39,156 --> 00:41:43,820
And, and that baggage creates tension.

324
00:41:43,894 --> 00:41:47,261
So what do you do about it?

325
00:41:47,331 --> 00:41:49,959
Well, you can pretend it's not there...

326
00:41:50,034 --> 00:41:53,765
or you can choose not to have friends...

327
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:58,172
or you can acknowledge that it's
there and have friends anyway.

328
00:41:58,242 --> 00:42:00,608
Like my dad?

329
00:42:02,113 --> 00:42:04,445
Right.

330
00:42:04,515 --> 00:42:08,747
I don't think that I like
my dad when he's around you.

331
00:42:15,025 --> 00:42:17,118
Well, that's...

332
00:42:17,194 --> 00:42:21,790
because your dad doesn't like
himself when he's around me.

333
00:42:21,866 --> 00:42:23,800
But that's okay.

334
00:42:23,868 --> 00:42:27,735
That's... part of what
friends do to each other.

335
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:34,468
- Good night.
- Good night.

336
00:43:02,238 --> 00:43:04,263
I... I just graduated.

337
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,274
Really? So did I.

338
00:43:06,342 --> 00:43:10,278
- Oh, yeah? In what?
- Radio communications.

339
00:43:10,346 --> 00:43:13,941
- So, so is that what you do?
- That's what I'd like to do.

340
00:43:14,017 --> 00:43:17,282
I do a little
freelance deejay stuff...

341
00:43:17,353 --> 00:43:20,447
but, you know, right now
I'm just driving a cab.

342
00:43:20,523 --> 00:43:23,332
I thought you might
do something like that.

343
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:24,289
Drive a cab?

344
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:28,062
No, do something
where, you use your voice.

345
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,297
Why?

346
00:43:29,365 --> 00:43:34,234
I don't know why.
Because you're easy to listen to.

347
00:43:34,304 --> 00:43:37,796
Because of my voice?

348
00:43:56,326 --> 00:44:00,422
I just need to find
a structure, you know?

349
00:44:00,497 --> 00:44:02,431
What do you mean?

350
00:44:02,499 --> 00:44:07,095
Listen, I waste so much time, you know?
I just-My days just slip by, you know?

351
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:11,300
- Isn't that what days are supposed to do?
- Yeah.

352
00:44:11,374 --> 00:44:14,775
Not if you want to make
something of yourself, you know?

353
00:44:14,844 --> 00:44:18,940
What do you want to make of yourself?

354
00:44:19,015 --> 00:44:23,452
I don't know. I just feel that I was
meant to do something with my time.

355
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,287
I mean, otherwise, I wouldn't be
thinking of this this way.

356
00:44:28,358 --> 00:44:32,624
I'd be able to just continue
what I was doing, you know?

357
00:44:39,869 --> 00:44:44,636
Do you have a lot of friends?

358
00:44:46,442 --> 00:44:50,378
Not really. Do you?

359
00:44:50,446 --> 00:44:53,745
- No.
- Yeah.

360
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:59,049
Do you ever feel like you need a friend?

361
00:44:59,122 --> 00:45:02,580
Yeah, sometimes.

362
00:45:02,659 --> 00:45:05,719
When?

363
00:45:05,795 --> 00:45:08,389
Like right now.

364
00:45:08,464 --> 00:45:11,228
Why?

365
00:45:11,301 --> 00:45:14,394
'Cause I just met you and...

366
00:45:14,469 --> 00:45:17,905
I just feel like
telling someone, you know?

367
00:45:58,113 --> 00:46:02,209
No way. No way, no way.

368
00:46:04,953 --> 00:46:07,046
- Hi.
- Hi.

369
00:46:07,122 --> 00:46:10,216
- Jesus.
- What's the matter?

370
00:46:10,292 --> 00:46:13,523
"What's the matter?"
Her wigs, her clothes.

371
00:46:13,595 --> 00:46:17,725
Sometimes I just feel like
throwing them all away, you know?

372
00:46:17,799 --> 00:46:19,892
What are you looking for, Zoe?

373
00:46:25,474 --> 00:46:28,238
- I mean, is this where you see your future?
- My future?

374
00:46:30,312 --> 00:46:32,246
The club?

375
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:40,411
When Mom died, my immediate idea was
to get rid of this place. Just sell it.

376
00:46:40,489 --> 00:46:44,363
I never thought it would
have any interest for me.

377
00:46:44,364 --> 00:46:45,654
So why did it?

378
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,531
I used to be very shy as a child.

379
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:57,197
I used to watch my mother for hours...

380
00:46:57,272 --> 00:47:01,038
just admiring her sense of freedom.

381
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:06,646
So when the opportunity came up,
I thought I would take on the challenge.

382
00:47:06,715 --> 00:47:11,584
So you feel better about adopting her
options rather than creating your own?

383
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:15,616
I have created my own options too.

384
00:47:15,691 --> 00:47:18,057
I know.

385
00:47:26,668 --> 00:47:30,331
It's your contract
for the baby with Eric.

386
00:47:30,405 --> 00:47:32,771
I found it.

387
00:47:32,841 --> 00:47:35,901
Does he know?

388
00:47:35,977 --> 00:47:38,343
I would hope so.

389
00:47:38,413 --> 00:47:43,350
Otherwise he might just think I'm disgusted
with him for no particular reason.

390
00:47:45,587 --> 00:47:48,920
Look, I really desperately
needed this child...

391
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:52,016
and it just worked out with Eric.

392
00:47:52,094 --> 00:47:54,722
I didn't mean to hurt you.

393
00:47:54,796 --> 00:47:58,425
You know, I remember when your
mother built this hallway.

394
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,732
She... she built it for this very
rich man who used to come here.

395
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:09,532
He used to get off watching us dance for
other guys, so he actually paid her...

396
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:13,137
to construct this very special
place that he could watch us from.

397
00:48:14,915 --> 00:48:17,145
Your mother never told us that.

398
00:48:17,218 --> 00:48:19,812
She said it was to protect us...

399
00:48:19,887 --> 00:48:22,822
so she could patrol things.

400
00:48:26,093 --> 00:48:28,220
And I believed her.

401
00:48:29,797 --> 00:48:32,391
Until Eric told me the truth.

402
00:48:35,336 --> 00:48:37,270
Why did you believe him?

403
00:48:37,338 --> 00:48:39,738
I made a choice.

404
00:48:42,743 --> 00:48:47,339
And Eric promised me
he'd never lie to me.

405
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:32,748
How could anyone...

406
00:49:32,827 --> 00:49:35,261
hurt you?

407
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,735
Take you away from me?

408
00:49:47,675 --> 00:49:50,303
How could anyone?

409
00:50:38,158 --> 00:50:41,127
What's this machine?

410
00:50:41,195 --> 00:50:44,130
It's an incubator.

411
00:50:44,198 --> 00:50:48,964
- Wh-What's it for?
- Well, what do you think it's for?

412
00:50:49,035 --> 00:50:51,560
- Eggs.
- That's right.

413
00:50:51,638 --> 00:50:54,698
Are they yours?

414
00:50:54,774 --> 00:50:57,368
Wh-What do you mean?

415
00:50:57,443 --> 00:51:01,188
I mean, shouldn't you be
sitting on them or something?

416
00:51:01,189 --> 00:51:02,005
Oh, yeah.

417
00:51:02,081 --> 00:51:05,380
Well, I guess I've abandoned the nest.

418
00:51:14,794 --> 00:51:19,891
What's inside of them?

419
00:51:19,966 --> 00:51:24,062
- The eggs?
- Yes.

420
00:51:24,137 --> 00:51:26,731
Well, Hyacinth Macaws...

421
00:51:26,806 --> 00:51:29,673
if you want to know the absolute truth.

422
00:51:29,742 --> 00:51:32,336
And where did you get them?

423
00:51:32,412 --> 00:51:38,180
From... very far away.

424
00:51:53,266 --> 00:51:56,360
Hey, check her out?

425
00:51:59,272 --> 00:52:02,469
I said check her out.

426
00:52:02,542 --> 00:52:06,706
- Yeah.
- You talking to me?

427
00:52:06,779 --> 00:52:10,715
Yes, I'm talking to you.

428
00:52:12,785 --> 00:52:15,049
What? Check who out?

429
00:52:15,121 --> 00:52:17,817
The babe that's dancing for you, man.

430
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:22,054
You've given her quite a run
for your money, man.

431
00:52:22,128 --> 00:52:24,892
What do you mean by that?

432
00:52:24,964 --> 00:52:28,991
- She's been dancing for you all night.
- Yeah.

433
00:52:29,068 --> 00:52:33,061
Yeah, and not just tonight. I mean, I've
noticed you with her other nights too.

434
00:52:36,075 --> 00:52:39,602
You come in here all the time or...

435
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:44,343
Yeah. All the time.

436
00:52:44,417 --> 00:52:49,013
This-Visuals, you know?
It's good.

437
00:52:49,088 --> 00:52:52,353
But...

438
00:52:52,425 --> 00:52:57,260
she seems to have a bit of a
thing for you, doesn't she?

439
00:52:59,098 --> 00:53:02,659
We... get along.

440
00:53:02,735 --> 00:53:06,865
I'm sure you do, my friend.

441
00:53:06,939 --> 00:53:10,705
What do you two talk about?

442
00:53:10,777 --> 00:53:16,374
Just... the usual, I guess.

443
00:53:16,449 --> 00:53:18,383
The usual?

444
00:53:18,451 --> 00:53:23,388
I don't think you're talking
about what I would call "usual."

445
00:53:23,456 --> 00:53:26,220
- Why not?
- Because I can tell.

446
00:53:26,292 --> 00:53:29,819
You get pretty intense,
my friend.

447
00:53:29,896 --> 00:53:32,421
Well, I guess that's just the way I am.

448
00:53:36,068 --> 00:53:41,335
So, Hey, why don't you
give her a little touch?

449
00:53:41,406 --> 00:53:47,174
- You're not supposed to touch.
- But she is into it, believe me.

450
00:53:47,245 --> 00:53:50,510
Yeah.

451
00:53:50,582 --> 00:53:56,020
- How do you know?
- Everybody knows, man.

452
00:53:56,088 --> 00:53:58,818
Trust me, my friend.

453
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:02,849
Trust me. Just a little touch.

454
00:54:02,928 --> 00:54:07,024
Nothing too drastic.

455
00:54:07,099 --> 00:54:11,365
Then you will get
the full experience, my friend...

456
00:54:11,436 --> 00:54:13,996
and you will love it.

457
00:54:14,072 --> 00:54:18,532
You will love it. Okay?

458
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:23,274
And what happens when I touch her?

459
00:54:23,348 --> 00:54:27,876
What happens?

460
00:55:03,421 --> 00:55:07,118
You're outta here, man!
Get out!

461
00:55:10,428 --> 00:55:13,192
Come on. Get down there.

462
00:55:13,265 --> 00:55:15,927
Come on. Go.

463
00:55:31,685 --> 00:55:34,278
Hey, what the hell you doin'?
Get off the road!

464
00:55:39,525 --> 00:55:42,688
Move!

465
00:56:02,715 --> 00:56:04,980
What's so funny?

466
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:08,144
It's like pettin' a gorilla.

467
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,985
Well...

468
00:56:11,056 --> 00:56:13,992
Was your father this hairy?

469
00:56:14,059 --> 00:56:18,156
No, I... I got it
from my mother.

470
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:20,664
I mean, I mean,
from my mother's side of the family.

471
00:56:20,732 --> 00:56:26,500
That's where you
inherit hair patterns.

472
00:56:26,571 --> 00:56:31,441
- My uncle's bald.
- On your mother's side?

473
00:56:34,013 --> 00:56:37,778
Well, I guess I'm talking
about usual patterns.

474
00:56:37,849 --> 00:56:42,287
There's always exceptions.

475
00:56:42,354 --> 00:56:44,947
That's...

476
00:56:45,024 --> 00:56:50,462
That's the way these things... work.

477
00:57:01,373 --> 00:57:04,206
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

478
00:57:04,275 --> 00:57:07,301
No, I'm fine.

479
00:57:07,379 --> 00:57:11,314
You don't look fine.

480
00:57:11,382 --> 00:57:14,682
You worry about me, don't you?

481
00:57:14,753 --> 00:57:18,813
You think this is normal?

482
00:57:18,891 --> 00:57:23,123
- What?
- What we do.

483
00:57:25,563 --> 00:57:27,929
What do we do?

484
00:57:30,001 --> 00:57:32,834
That's just it.
We don't speak about it.

485
00:57:32,905 --> 00:57:38,775
You know that feeling
you get sometimes, Tracey...

486
00:57:38,843 --> 00:57:42,074
that you didn't ask to be
brought into the world?

487
00:57:43,848 --> 00:57:45,782
Yeah.

488
00:57:47,686 --> 00:57:49,881
Well, then who did?

489
00:57:49,955 --> 00:57:52,115
What?

490
00:57:52,191 --> 00:57:54,556
If you think that you didn't ask...

491
00:57:54,627 --> 00:57:58,562
to be brought into the world...

492
00:57:58,631 --> 00:58:01,191
then who did?

493
00:58:15,347 --> 00:58:20,478
All I'm saying is nobody asked you if
you wanted to be brought into the world.

494
00:58:20,551 --> 00:58:23,988
You just ended up getting here.

495
00:58:26,057 --> 00:58:30,085
So the question is,
now that you're here...

496
00:58:30,162 --> 00:58:34,098
who's asking you to stay?

497
00:58:44,676 --> 00:58:47,611
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

498
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,978
Look, are you sure you're gonna be okay?

499
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:53,950
Yes.

500
00:58:54,019 --> 00:58:56,009
Good night.

501
00:59:01,193 --> 00:59:03,127
Good night.

502
00:59:11,936 --> 00:59:13,960
- He touched you?
- He didn't want to.

503
00:59:14,037 --> 00:59:17,030
- What do you mean?
- I know him.

504
00:59:17,108 --> 00:59:22,102
- We all know him. He's crazy about you.
- Not like that.

505
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:24,381
Why didn't you get one of the
boys to handle this, Eric?

506
00:59:24,414 --> 00:59:27,645
Because I didn't think of it.

507
00:59:27,718 --> 00:59:30,186
I just saw him touch her, and...

508
00:59:30,253 --> 00:59:32,245
Why didn't you ask him to leave?

509
00:59:32,323 --> 00:59:34,518
- Because he wouldn't have listened.
- How do you know that?

510
00:59:34,591 --> 00:59:37,584
Because he's in his own world,
the ass-wipe.

511
00:59:37,662 --> 00:59:39,857
I don't know where
you're both coming from.

512
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:44,265
You are telling me that he touched you,
but he really didn't.

513
00:59:44,335 --> 00:59:47,862
And you're saying that you overreacted,
but you didn't have a choice?

514
00:59:47,938 --> 00:59:51,705
- I didn't.
- Why not?

515
00:59:51,775 --> 00:59:57,237
Why not?
Because he touched you.

516
00:59:57,314 --> 01:00:00,614
Okay.

517
01:00:00,684 --> 01:00:03,313
All I'm concerned about
is if he makes a case...

518
01:00:03,386 --> 01:00:07,117
I have to know what happened.

519
01:00:07,191 --> 01:00:09,249
We told you what happened, Zoe.

520
01:00:09,326 --> 01:00:12,455
And that is what happened?

521
01:00:17,701 --> 01:00:21,160
- Yeah.
- Okay.

522
01:00:21,239 --> 01:00:24,105
Is that it?

523
01:00:27,044 --> 01:00:29,136
Hi. This is Thomas.

524
01:00:29,212 --> 01:00:31,477
I am not in at the present time,
but I am in town.

525
01:00:31,549 --> 01:00:36,316
Please leave a message
following the beep.

526
01:00:36,386 --> 01:00:38,479
Good morning.

527
01:00:38,556 --> 01:00:42,992
You're probably not up yet,
so you haven't seen what I've done.

528
01:00:43,059 --> 01:00:46,655
I'm a customs officer at the airport.

529
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:51,828
Actually, I saw you the other day when
you were having your bags inspected.

530
01:00:51,902 --> 01:00:55,838
I know-I know how you probably
smuggled those eggs in.

531
01:00:55,907 --> 01:01:00,674
There's a special unit at work. I think
they give them to the zoo or something.

532
01:01:00,744 --> 01:01:05,681
They asked me where I got them.
I had to lie.

533
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:07,684
Where are they?

534
01:01:07,751 --> 01:01:10,345
- I took them.
- Where?

535
01:01:10,421 --> 01:01:13,355
- I'd like to see you again.
- Oh, no.

536
01:01:13,424 --> 01:01:16,222
No, they're in the country now.
They're definitely in the country.

537
01:01:16,294 --> 01:01:18,626
It's just I don't have
them with me presently,

538
01:01:18,627 --> 01:01:20,196
but it doesn't mean I can't get them.

539
01:01:20,263 --> 01:01:23,528
And if you can give me, like...
just a couple...

540
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,695
- Good morning.
- Hi. And I'm here. Okay.

541
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:29,797
So I'll call...
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

542
01:01:29,874 --> 01:01:32,308
You look like you're
in worse shape than I am.

543
01:01:32,376 --> 01:01:35,470
What happened to you?

544
01:01:35,546 --> 01:01:38,309
I fell down some stairs and...

545
01:01:38,381 --> 01:01:41,977
- Are you okay?
- Well, do I look okay?

546
01:01:42,052 --> 01:01:43,133
No, not really.

547
01:01:43,134 --> 01:01:46,489
Well, I'm better than I look.
Here, I got you a coffee.

548
01:01:46,556 --> 01:01:49,321
I didn't...
I didn't know how you took it.

549
01:01:49,393 --> 01:01:51,657
Black's fine.

550
01:01:51,729 --> 01:01:54,822
- I added cream.
- That's okay.

551
01:01:54,897 --> 01:01:58,663
- No, here, have mine. No, I insist.
- No, really...

552
01:02:02,238 --> 01:02:04,332
What is it?

553
01:02:04,406 --> 01:02:08,502
Well, it's just that
this has cream in it too.

554
01:02:08,577 --> 01:02:11,171
It's milk.

555
01:02:11,248 --> 01:02:14,012
Good.

556
01:02:14,084 --> 01:02:16,017
Okay, well, I'll...

557
01:02:16,086 --> 01:02:19,021
I'll get to work.

558
01:03:03,399 --> 01:03:05,993
What?

559
01:03:06,069 --> 01:03:08,502
What is it?

560
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:13,166
What is it that gives a
schoolgirl her special innocence?

561
01:03:14,911 --> 01:03:18,846
Is it the way they smell?

562
01:03:18,914 --> 01:03:23,851
The sweet smell
of their perfume, of their hair?

563
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:28,413
The aroma of fresh flowers...

564
01:03:28,490 --> 01:03:30,459
and all that other stuff
that hasn't been fucked up...

565
01:03:30,526 --> 01:03:33,962
by late nights and a lot of bad food.

566
01:03:36,865 --> 01:03:42,634
Is it their gestures...
and the way they move?

567
01:03:42,706 --> 01:03:47,803
The way their body still holds on to
some semblance of self-respect and...

568
01:03:47,877 --> 01:03:51,642
and dignity?

569
01:03:51,714 --> 01:03:55,981
When they wrap their
beautiful legs around you...

570
01:03:56,051 --> 01:03:59,988
tight and holding on,
looking at you...

571
01:04:00,055 --> 01:04:01,989
you looking at them.

572
01:04:02,057 --> 01:04:05,323
It's just...

573
01:04:05,395 --> 01:04:08,158
Or is it whatever comes out
of their cute little mouths?

574
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:11,666
All those questions,
all that wondering that...

575
01:04:16,739 --> 01:04:18,372
It's just, you know, you...

576
01:04:18,373 --> 01:04:21,335
They got their whole lives
ahead of them, you know?

577
01:04:21,411 --> 01:04:24,847
And you've wasted half of yours away.

578
01:04:24,914 --> 01:04:26,848
Damn.

579
01:04:28,584 --> 01:04:30,677
What is it?

580
01:04:33,189 --> 01:04:36,282
There's this feeling
I get sometimes, you know?

581
01:04:36,358 --> 01:04:38,953
What sort of feeling?

582
01:04:39,028 --> 01:04:43,964
That I wasn't ever meant
to be satisfied.

583
01:04:44,032 --> 01:04:47,126
Satisfied with what?

584
01:04:47,202 --> 01:04:49,636
A lot of things.

585
01:04:49,704 --> 01:04:52,139
I mean, it seems to me that
every time I'm about to...

586
01:04:52,207 --> 01:04:56,644
you know, get a hold
of something or someone...

587
01:04:56,712 --> 01:05:01,978
it's just bound to slip away.

588
01:05:02,050 --> 01:05:04,645
Maybe you want it to slip away.

589
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:07,984
Maybe I want what to slip away?

590
01:05:08,056 --> 01:05:13,154
The things that you think
you're about to have.

591
01:05:13,227 --> 01:05:16,993
What would you think about that?

592
01:05:17,065 --> 01:05:20,160
As a general philosophy...

593
01:05:20,234 --> 01:05:22,498
or how it pertains to you?

594
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:25,665
You think you could talk
about how it pertains to me?

595
01:05:25,741 --> 01:05:28,174
What do you mean?

596
01:05:28,242 --> 01:05:32,270
Well, I feel like I want you.

597
01:05:32,347 --> 01:05:37,444
Do you think that means
you'll slip away?

598
01:05:43,192 --> 01:05:45,887
Dad?

599
01:05:45,961 --> 01:05:50,727
I'm not going to baby-sit
for Uncle Francis anymore.

600
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:53,962
Baby-sit?
You go there to practice.

601
01:05:54,035 --> 01:05:57,300
That's absurd.

602
01:05:57,372 --> 01:05:59,771
Why?

603
01:05:59,842 --> 01:06:05,144
Dad, he pretends I'm still
baby-sitting for him.

604
01:06:05,213 --> 01:06:07,647
Why would you think that?

605
01:06:07,716 --> 01:06:09,684
Because he's paying me.

606
01:06:09,751 --> 01:06:12,617
To house-sit.

607
01:06:16,391 --> 01:06:18,950
Twenty dollars an hour?

608
01:06:19,026 --> 01:06:22,428
When did it go up?

609
01:06:22,497 --> 01:06:25,330
He wants to believe
that Lisa's still there.

610
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,459
I make it easier for him
to convince himself.

611
01:06:31,173 --> 01:06:35,609
Francis always had strange
ways to convince himself...

612
01:06:35,676 --> 01:06:38,612
of many things.

613
01:06:38,679 --> 01:06:44,448
Things that never happened,
things that might happen.

614
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:50,117
People who did things
for reasons, but they didn't.

615
01:06:52,194 --> 01:06:56,631
What has any of this
got to do with me, Dad?

616
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:03,136
Nothing.

617
01:07:03,204 --> 01:07:06,299
Nothing at all.

618
01:07:06,375 --> 01:07:10,310
So why do I have to keep going there?

619
01:07:10,378 --> 01:07:12,642
You don't.

620
01:07:12,713 --> 01:07:15,147
And you'll tell him?

621
01:07:20,021 --> 01:07:24,482
I was in here the other night
when that guy was thrown out.

622
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:29,257
Why did that happen?
Has he ever been thrown out before?

623
01:07:29,329 --> 01:07:33,425
- Why do you think he would touch you?
- Why do you think he would touch you?

624
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,595
Why do you think he would touch you?

625
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:40,265
Well, what do you think was
going through his mind when he...

626
01:07:40,341 --> 01:07:43,936
Or-Or what was he thinking?

627
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:46,605
- Well...
- What's so funny?

628
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,615
Well, this is a joke, right?

629
01:07:48,683 --> 01:07:50,947
Not at all.

630
01:07:51,018 --> 01:07:55,750
If you do this favor for me,
I'll do that favor for you.

631
01:07:58,858 --> 01:08:01,520
But I'm not hiding anything.

632
01:08:01,596 --> 01:08:05,895
Thomas, you're hiding
a smuggling operation...

633
01:08:05,967 --> 01:08:10,961
that brings in over $200,000 a year,
probably a lot more.

634
01:08:11,038 --> 01:08:13,063
We've suspected you for a long time.

635
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:16,631
I was just brought in to
confirm what was already known.

636
01:08:16,711 --> 01:08:19,202
So how do you want me to report back?

637
01:08:23,049 --> 01:08:26,712
All I'm asking for is a bit of help.

638
01:08:26,787 --> 01:08:29,347
That's all.

639
01:08:29,423 --> 01:08:33,985
It's very important for me to know these
things. Just ask her these questions.

640
01:08:34,061 --> 01:08:38,327
Do this for me,
and you have a clean slate.

641
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:44,201
This really hasn't been my day.

642
01:08:44,271 --> 01:08:48,708
So change things.
Make it your day.

643
01:08:50,845 --> 01:08:53,279
And all you men sitting
near that stage, I can see you.

644
01:08:53,347 --> 01:08:55,439
I know what you're thinking.

645
01:08:55,515 --> 01:08:58,780
You're thinking that "because I'm
sitting next to that stage..."

646
01:08:58,852 --> 01:09:01,616
I'm getting the same feeling
as all those guys...

647
01:09:01,688 --> 01:09:05,625
"shoveling out that cash for
their own private dancer."

648
01:09:05,693 --> 01:09:09,789
Well, you know, you guys want
to watch, go to the movies.

649
01:09:09,864 --> 01:09:12,627
We're in the live-action
business here, gents.

650
01:09:12,699 --> 01:09:14,124
And, okay, granted...

651
01:09:14,125 --> 01:09:18,467
Granted, that beautiful creature
writhing before you on stage...

652
01:09:18,539 --> 01:09:21,632
she maybe, you know,
smiles at you.

653
01:09:21,708 --> 01:09:23,643
She winks her eyes at you
occasionally...

654
01:09:23,711 --> 01:09:25,975
and you may feel like the man.

655
01:09:26,047 --> 01:09:28,038
Is that all you guys are looking for?

656
01:09:28,115 --> 01:09:32,073
Is that all you want?
Come on, come on.

657
01:09:32,153 --> 01:09:36,088
Invite one of our lovely ladies over
to your table where the real action is.

658
01:09:36,156 --> 01:09:38,750
- Yeah!
- Hi.

659
01:09:38,826 --> 01:09:41,419
I'm really sorry that took so long,
or I took so long.

660
01:09:41,495 --> 01:09:43,587
- Hi.
- It's such a busy night.

661
01:09:43,664 --> 01:09:46,598
Hi. I'm Chrissy.

662
01:09:46,667 --> 01:09:49,430
Hi. I'm Thomas.

663
01:09:49,502 --> 01:09:53,939
It's nice to meet you, Thomas.
I like the name Thomas a lot.

664
01:09:54,007 --> 01:09:55,942
Oh, thanks.

665
01:09:56,010 --> 01:09:58,102
Are you from out of town?

666
01:09:58,178 --> 01:10:00,112
Yes.

667
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:02,444
Where are you from?

668
01:10:02,515 --> 01:10:06,611
San Francisco.

669
01:10:06,687 --> 01:10:09,451
You're kidding.
I love San Francisco.

670
01:10:09,523 --> 01:10:12,116
You've-You've been there?

671
01:10:12,193 --> 01:10:17,459
Yeah, I was there a couple of
years ago with my debating team.

672
01:10:17,529 --> 01:10:19,623
Debating team?

673
01:10:19,698 --> 01:10:23,465
That's-I admire
someone who can debate well.

674
01:10:23,536 --> 01:10:26,629
I mean, who can debate
instead of just argue.

675
01:10:26,706 --> 01:10:31,143
Well, anyone can argue, but it's
a good skill, discipline...

676
01:10:31,211 --> 01:10:33,975
to be able to debate and stand back.

677
01:10:34,047 --> 01:10:37,312
And that's something you
can apply in your life...

678
01:10:37,384 --> 01:10:39,648
outside of school.

679
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:42,653
And, and when you're meeting
someone or negotiating.

680
01:10:42,721 --> 01:10:43,580
Negotiating?

681
01:10:43,581 --> 01:10:47,158
Well, I mean, if you have...
If you have to...

682
01:10:47,226 --> 01:10:52,163
It's a good skill to learn,
as opposed to cheerleading or...

683
01:10:52,231 --> 01:10:54,166
Well, that's what I say.

684
01:10:54,234 --> 01:10:56,668
Don't be nervous about this, Thomas.

685
01:10:56,735 --> 01:11:00,172
- We're gonna have some fun, okay?
- Sure.

686
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,834
Sure.

687
01:11:20,092 --> 01:11:24,359
I was here the other night...

688
01:11:24,431 --> 01:11:26,365
What night was that?

689
01:11:26,432 --> 01:11:29,629
The night th-that guy was thrown out.

690
01:11:29,701 --> 01:11:31,966
You were dancing for him.

691
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:34,972
His name is Francis.

692
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:37,566
What happened?

693
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:45,149
He was a bad boy.

694
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:50,086
- Wh-What do you mean by that?
- What do I mean?

695
01:11:50,155 --> 01:11:53,182
I mean, have you danced
for him before a lot?

696
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:58,389
- And has he ever been thrown out before?
- No.

697
01:11:58,465 --> 01:12:00,625
So what do you think happened?

698
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:03,827
He touched me.

699
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:06,837
And when you're dancing
for the customer...

700
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:09,669
they can't touch.

701
01:12:09,741 --> 01:12:12,575
Yes, but why do you think
he touched you last night?

702
01:12:12,644 --> 01:12:15,374
Has he ever touched you before?

703
01:12:15,447 --> 01:12:18,508
Is this what you really want to talk
about for five bucks a dance, Thomas?

704
01:12:18,585 --> 01:12:22,783
Well, I just want to know what you
think was going on in his mind.

705
01:12:22,855 --> 01:12:26,222
Are you here for some kind
of psychology conference?

706
01:12:26,292 --> 01:12:30,125
Well, yes.

707
01:12:30,196 --> 01:12:32,960
I am, actually.

708
01:12:33,031 --> 01:12:35,967
He's...

709
01:12:36,035 --> 01:12:39,299
He's a very particular case.

710
01:12:39,372 --> 01:12:42,636
Particular in what way?

711
01:12:45,377 --> 01:12:49,644
You want the full story?

712
01:12:49,715 --> 01:12:50,215
Sure.

713
01:12:58,724 --> 01:13:01,692
His daughter was murdered
a couple of years ago...

714
01:13:01,759 --> 01:13:05,321
and then he was implicated.

715
01:13:05,396 --> 01:13:07,990
- For th-the murder?
- Yeah.

716
01:13:08,066 --> 01:13:10,360
- But why?
- I don't know.

717
01:13:10,361 --> 01:13:13,333
I don't really remember the details.

718
01:13:13,404 --> 01:13:16,498
I mean, he was cleared, and then
they caught the guy who did it.

719
01:13:16,575 --> 01:13:20,841
But... it obviously had, like, this...

720
01:13:20,912 --> 01:13:22,846
this incredible effect on him.

721
01:13:22,914 --> 01:13:26,180
I mean, he is...

722
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:30,277
He's just so fucked up about it.

723
01:13:34,526 --> 01:13:38,622
You know...

724
01:13:38,697 --> 01:13:41,632
Thomas...

725
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:46,364
Francis and I have a very
special type of relationship.

726
01:13:46,438 --> 01:13:49,634
And I've never-I've never minded.

727
01:13:49,708 --> 01:13:53,143
But then he chose to violate it.

728
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:55,975
S-Special in what way?

729
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:06,487
Well, we've, we've always
had this understanding.

730
01:14:06,557 --> 01:14:09,652
I mean, I need him
for certain things...

731
01:14:09,728 --> 01:14:12,662
and... he needs me for certain things.

732
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:15,164
I mean,
that's the way it's been.

733
01:14:15,232 --> 01:14:18,498
And how did he violate that?

734
01:14:18,569 --> 01:14:24,337
He-He violated that in his-his, in his
role and what he was supposed to do for me.

735
01:14:24,409 --> 01:14:26,900
Wh-What's he su-Why?

736
01:14:26,979 --> 01:14:30,210
What's he supposed to do for you? I
mean, he comes to this club. He pays you.

737
01:14:30,281 --> 01:14:34,115
Because I was doing things for him...

738
01:14:34,185 --> 01:14:37,178
and he's done things for me.

739
01:14:40,525 --> 01:14:43,789
What has he done for you?

740
01:14:43,862 --> 01:14:46,796
I'm...

741
01:14:46,864 --> 01:14:50,300
I'm sorry.

742
01:14:50,368 --> 01:14:55,431
Okay, this is really stupid.

743
01:14:55,507 --> 01:15:01,308
And then I'm getting so emotional
over the fact that he touched me...

744
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:05,645
because, I mean, he was,
he was always paying me...

745
01:15:05,717 --> 01:15:08,810
to do him this favor and...

746
01:15:08,886 --> 01:15:10,821
- What favor?
- I don't know, Thomas.

747
01:15:10,889 --> 01:15:14,825
- Why do you want to know all this?
- Well, I'm sorry, but I...

748
01:15:14,893 --> 01:15:19,386
What is it about a schoolgirl that gives
her that special innocence, gentlemen?

749
01:15:19,463 --> 01:15:23,490
Such a thing that you have
absolutely no control over.

750
01:15:23,567 --> 01:15:27,162
You never have.

751
01:15:27,239 --> 01:15:31,335
And you never will.

752
01:15:31,410 --> 01:15:33,541
After this break, we'll be
right back with sweet Chrissy...

753
01:15:33,542 --> 01:15:34,606
He's not supposed to do that.

754
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:36,614
- Who'll help us answer that question.
- Do what?

755
01:15:36,681 --> 01:15:38,615
He's not supposed to...
He's not suppose...

756
01:15:38,683 --> 01:15:41,448
He can obviously see from his booth that
I'm sitting here talking with a client.

757
01:15:41,519 --> 01:15:44,284
He's not supposed to call me
when I'm talking with a client.

758
01:15:44,355 --> 01:15:48,290
Why? Do you have to go now?

759
01:15:49,693 --> 01:15:51,628
Yeah.

760
01:15:51,696 --> 01:15:55,792
But I want to come back,
and I want to, you know, talk.

761
01:15:55,865 --> 01:15:59,802
But I want to move downstairs.
I don't like it here.

762
01:15:59,870 --> 01:16:01,804
Sure, sure, sure.

763
01:16:01,872 --> 01:16:05,068
Okay. I'll see you soon.

764
01:16:11,882 --> 01:16:17,218
I'm going to move to the washroom.

765
01:16:45,181 --> 01:16:50,119
Hey, I've noticed you've been spending
a lot of time with that lady.

766
01:16:50,187 --> 01:16:52,621
Are you-Are you talking to me?

767
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:54,953
Yeah.

768
01:16:55,025 --> 01:16:59,359
You seem to... to both
hit it off together.

769
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:01,955
- Well, I guess.
- Yeah.

770
01:17:02,032 --> 01:17:04,192
I guess that can happen.

771
01:17:04,267 --> 01:17:08,466
So what do you guys talk about?

772
01:17:08,538 --> 01:17:11,975
Just things.

773
01:17:12,042 --> 01:17:15,807
What sort of things?

774
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:17,814
Oh, this and that.

775
01:17:17,882 --> 01:17:20,213
"This and that"?

776
01:17:20,284 --> 01:17:24,311
You know, it's amazing how...

777
01:17:24,388 --> 01:17:28,915
you can hit it off with
someone like that, isn't it?

778
01:17:33,497 --> 01:17:37,593
Have you ever noticed that some
people just drift into your life...

779
01:17:37,668 --> 01:17:41,468
like you've known them forever?

780
01:17:41,538 --> 01:17:44,440
I mean, there are some people
that you can remember...

781
01:17:44,507 --> 01:17:49,275
the moment that you met them
really clearly.

782
01:17:49,345 --> 01:17:52,440
And other people that...

783
01:17:52,516 --> 01:17:58,284
it seems like you've known them forever,
even though you haven't.

784
01:17:58,354 --> 01:18:03,122
And they all become part of this
continuous memory you have of yourself.

785
01:18:03,193 --> 01:18:06,959
This ongoing...

786
01:18:07,030 --> 01:18:08,965
Are you with me?

787
01:18:09,033 --> 01:18:12,628
Yeah, I think so.

788
01:18:12,702 --> 01:18:14,636
I mean, here you are,
y-you know...

789
01:18:14,705 --> 01:18:16,969
you're having this beautiful
conversation with her.

790
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:22,138
You're getting to know each other, and...

791
01:18:22,212 --> 01:18:26,478
I mean, there's other guys
that come in here.

792
01:18:26,549 --> 01:18:30,418
There's this one guy who comes in here
every other night or something...

793
01:18:30,487 --> 01:18:34,583
and he spends a few hours with her.

794
01:18:34,658 --> 01:18:37,091
But he never really
gets to know her, you know?

795
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:41,596
Not the way you have.
Not the way you two...

796
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,596
She really seems to be herself with you.

797
01:18:52,007 --> 01:18:54,942
Well, how do you know?

798
01:18:57,013 --> 01:18:59,776
What? That she's being herself?

799
01:18:59,849 --> 01:19:02,942
Yeah.

800
01:19:03,018 --> 01:19:07,956
Because I used to be her lover.

801
01:19:08,024 --> 01:19:11,789
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't let you in.

802
01:19:11,861 --> 01:19:14,294
Look, why not?

803
01:19:15,864 --> 01:19:19,459
Look, can I... Can I at least
just talk to the manager?

804
01:19:19,535 --> 01:19:23,733
- You want to talk to the manager?
- Yeah.

805
01:19:23,805 --> 01:19:27,640
You have to understand that
we have very strict rules...

806
01:19:27,709 --> 01:19:30,235
regarding this sort of behavior here.

807
01:19:30,313 --> 01:19:33,908
- And I have always respected them.
- And this one time you didn't.

808
01:19:33,983 --> 01:19:36,746
Now, the problem, Mr. Brown,
is that this one time...

809
01:19:36,819 --> 01:19:40,914
happened in a room full of
other men who were watching.

810
01:19:40,989 --> 01:19:43,254
Now, if I let you back into the club...

811
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:46,451
what's to stop them from
trying to do the same thing?

812
01:19:46,452 --> 01:19:47,262
I told you.

813
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:50,423
Someone told me to do it.
I was set up.

814
01:19:50,499 --> 01:19:55,095
And you believed that someone?

815
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:59,266
- This is Security.
- Please, sit down.

816
01:19:59,342 --> 01:20:01,275
Thank you.

817
01:20:03,513 --> 01:20:06,948
Why did you touch her?

818
01:20:07,016 --> 01:20:10,746
- Well, I needed to make sure.
- Why?

819
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:13,845
What if she let you?
What would you have done?

820
01:20:13,922 --> 01:20:16,448
I'd have been disappointed.

821
01:20:18,026 --> 01:20:21,962
I'm not sure...
I understand you.

822
01:20:22,031 --> 01:20:25,398
That's not the way she was raised.

823
01:20:25,468 --> 01:20:28,027
You know her? Personally?

824
01:20:30,038 --> 01:20:33,804
There is another club I can recommend.

825
01:20:33,875 --> 01:20:35,968
I need to come here.

826
01:20:36,044 --> 01:20:40,606
- I understand that very well.
- No, I don't think you understand.

827
01:20:40,682 --> 01:20:44,312
Exotica is a special place.

828
01:20:44,387 --> 01:20:48,983
My mother was dedicated to creating a
very particular type of atmosphere...

829
01:20:49,057 --> 01:20:52,220
and I would like to maintain that.

830
01:20:52,294 --> 01:20:55,923
You don't understand.

831
01:20:58,735 --> 01:21:03,968
Mr. Brown, we're all aware
of what you've gone through.

832
01:21:04,039 --> 01:21:06,837
You've suffered a lot.

833
01:21:06,909 --> 01:21:12,006
But you have to understand that
Exotica is here for your amusement.

834
01:21:12,081 --> 01:21:15,608
We're here to entertain,
not to heal.

835
01:21:15,685 --> 01:21:19,017
There are other places for that.

836
01:21:21,922 --> 01:21:23,857
Other places?

837
01:21:23,925 --> 01:21:28,021
I can give you a list.

838
01:21:28,095 --> 01:21:30,120
Mr. Brown?

839
01:21:30,197 --> 01:21:32,256
Are you listening to me,
Mr. Brown?

840
01:21:48,717 --> 01:21:54,155
I just met this man in the washroom.

841
01:21:54,222 --> 01:21:56,156
What man?

842
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:58,158
Well, I'm not sure.
I was in a booth.

843
01:21:58,226 --> 01:22:00,659
I didn't really have
a chance to see him.

844
01:22:00,728 --> 01:22:04,824
- So how did you meet him?
- He just started talking to me.

845
01:22:04,899 --> 01:22:06,993
And what did he say?

846
01:22:07,069 --> 01:22:12,005
Well, he said
he used to be your lover.

847
01:22:12,073 --> 01:22:15,304
Well, it's always
a sad moment, gentlemen...

848
01:22:15,377 --> 01:22:20,336
when that clock
strikes that magic hour...

849
01:22:20,415 --> 01:22:26,012
and we have to send you out into
the long and dark and lonely night.

850
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:31,457
But just remember...

851
01:22:31,525 --> 01:22:35,963
we're only ever just a dream away...

852
01:22:36,031 --> 01:22:38,794
wherever that is.

853
01:22:56,884 --> 01:22:59,820
- I guess...
- I have to go.

854
01:23:01,389 --> 01:23:03,822
Oh, okay.

855
01:23:03,891 --> 01:23:06,486
Wait a minute.

856
01:23:06,561 --> 01:23:11,157
- Oh, no. Thomas, don't.
- No, no, no.

857
01:23:11,233 --> 01:23:15,999
- Thomas, please, don't.
- No, no. I insist.

858
01:23:16,071 --> 01:23:18,163
Please.

859
01:23:19,573 --> 01:23:21,667
Thank you.

860
01:23:30,217 --> 01:23:32,777
Your dad told me about...

861
01:23:32,853 --> 01:23:36,448
you not wanting to baby-sit anymore.

862
01:23:36,524 --> 01:23:40,291
There's no baby to sit.

863
01:23:43,031 --> 01:23:46,796
Well, I just want you
to know, I understand.

864
01:23:46,868 --> 01:23:50,303
Understand what?

865
01:23:50,371 --> 01:23:54,740
That this might all seem a little weird.

866
01:23:54,809 --> 01:23:58,141
A little?

867
01:23:59,547 --> 01:24:04,713
- I just want to thank you, Tracey.
- For what?

868
01:24:09,223 --> 01:24:12,317
You've been very patient.

869
01:24:12,392 --> 01:24:15,829
And...

870
01:24:15,896 --> 01:24:20,332
if you think the time has come for
this to end, then I understand.

871
01:24:27,574 --> 01:24:30,942
Thank you.

872
01:24:31,011 --> 01:24:33,445
Good night, Francis.

873
01:24:54,068 --> 01:24:57,128
He-He-He calls me from a table to dance.
Of course I expect you to do something.

874
01:24:57,204 --> 01:24:58,113
Christina...

875
01:24:58,114 --> 01:25:00,139
And then-and then he follows this guy
to the washroom...

876
01:25:00,206 --> 01:25:02,429
and he tells this guy
that, that he was my lover.

877
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:03,141
Well, he was.

878
01:25:03,209 --> 01:25:05,974
It's going too far, Zoe.

879
01:25:06,045 --> 01:25:10,983
Actually, baby, you have
no idea how far it's gone.

880
01:25:11,051 --> 01:25:13,645
You know,
I told him to touch you.

881
01:25:13,721 --> 01:25:17,521
I said you were into it. Yeah.

882
01:25:17,591 --> 01:25:21,017
It used to be wonderful
watching you dance for him,

883
01:25:21,018 --> 01:25:22,994
seeing how you could soothe him.

884
01:25:24,398 --> 01:25:27,332
I mean, it soothed me.

885
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:30,598
You know, you soothed me.

886
01:25:30,670 --> 01:25:32,661
Do you understand that?

887
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:38,273
- Hey, hey.
- Don't, don't, don't!

888
01:25:38,344 --> 01:25:42,281
- Stop. Stop that!
- Don't fucking touch me, you fucker!

889
01:25:42,349 --> 01:25:44,943
- Stop!
- Just fuck off, Zoe!

890
01:25:45,019 --> 01:25:48,613
- Stop it when I say! Eric!
- Stop it!

891
01:25:48,688 --> 01:25:50,622
Chill out! Chill out!

892
01:25:50,690 --> 01:25:53,284
Chill out! Relax!

893
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:55,954
- All right? Relax!
- Eric, come here!

894
01:25:56,030 --> 01:26:00,796
- John! Get out. What's the matter?
- No!

895
01:26:00,868 --> 01:26:04,132
Fuck off, Zoe! No!

896
01:26:28,562 --> 01:26:31,496
Morning, Thomas.

897
01:26:31,564 --> 01:26:35,091
- What happened?
- I had to leave.

898
01:26:35,168 --> 01:26:37,728
Did you hear everything?

899
01:26:37,804 --> 01:26:40,773
Yeah.

900
01:26:40,841 --> 01:26:43,435
Did you know?

901
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:45,602
Did I know what?

902
01:26:45,678 --> 01:26:49,614
That she knew...
about your daughter.

903
01:27:00,525 --> 01:27:04,963
You know, when the,
when the police came to question me...

904
01:27:05,031 --> 01:27:08,797
they told me a lot of things.

905
01:27:08,868 --> 01:27:13,304
They told me that my wife was
having an affair with my brother;

906
01:27:13,372 --> 01:27:16,308
Had been for years.

907
01:27:16,376 --> 01:27:20,709
They told me that I thought
Lisa wasn't my daughter.

908
01:27:22,381 --> 01:27:25,647
They told me I thought she was Harold's.

909
01:27:25,717 --> 01:27:27,776
Wh-Why would they say that?

910
01:27:27,853 --> 01:27:32,416
Because they thought I could harm her...

911
01:27:32,492 --> 01:27:37,259
that I would harm her.

912
01:27:37,330 --> 01:27:43,098
And then they found the man
that... that did it.

913
01:27:43,168 --> 01:27:46,935
Let me go.

914
01:27:47,005 --> 01:27:51,101
And I went home.

915
01:27:53,846 --> 01:27:58,111
And then my wife was killed in a
car accident a couple months later.

916
01:27:58,184 --> 01:28:02,951
And Harold was in the car.

917
01:28:04,689 --> 01:28:07,750
He lived.

918
01:28:28,814 --> 01:28:30,907
What do you think it would have taken...

919
01:28:30,983 --> 01:28:34,418
for your father to kill someone?

920
01:28:34,486 --> 01:28:39,253
I'm asking because there's
someone that I want to kill now.

921
01:28:39,324 --> 01:28:44,763
I felt it last night as I
listened to him in the washroom.

922
01:28:44,830 --> 01:28:46,924
I don't understand.

923
01:28:46,999 --> 01:28:50,935
He set me up... to touch her.

924
01:28:51,003 --> 01:28:53,096
Why would he do that?

925
01:28:53,172 --> 01:28:57,768
He took something very special from me.

926
01:28:57,843 --> 01:29:01,939
I've had too many
special things taken away.

927
01:29:02,013 --> 01:29:06,951
- That's why we have to go back tonight.
- To kill him?

928
01:29:07,019 --> 01:29:09,309
What would you do, Thomas?
What would you do?

929
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:10,112
Well...

930
01:29:10,188 --> 01:29:13,454
- Well, I would talk to him.
- I can't even get in there.

931
01:29:13,525 --> 01:29:16,461
What would you do?

932
01:29:16,529 --> 01:29:19,965
You go back tonight...

933
01:29:20,032 --> 01:29:22,626
and you have her dance for you...

934
01:29:22,702 --> 01:29:25,569
and then you touch her.

935
01:29:25,638 --> 01:29:28,300
And he'll throw you out
just like he threw me out.

936
01:29:28,374 --> 01:29:30,898
But I'll be waiting outside
with the gun.

937
01:29:30,976 --> 01:29:34,003
I'm not gonna help you kill somebody.

938
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:37,345
Not even to save a few years in prison?

939
01:29:37,416 --> 01:29:39,646
No.

940
01:29:42,153 --> 01:29:44,416
Well, to help me then?

941
01:29:49,661 --> 01:29:53,096
And that was Mirella,
gentlemen. Mirella.

942
01:29:53,163 --> 01:29:56,599
You can have her at your own
table for only five dollars.

943
01:29:56,668 --> 01:29:58,931
Thank you, Mirella.

944
01:30:01,172 --> 01:30:06,268
And now, it's always a pleasure to
announce to you our next dancer.

945
01:30:06,344 --> 01:30:10,440
Gentlemen, please, let's give
a big round of applause...

946
01:30:10,514 --> 01:30:15,714
for Christina.

947
01:33:43,526 --> 01:33:47,122
Don't be afraid.

948
01:33:47,196 --> 01:33:49,722
I know everything about you.

949
01:33:49,799 --> 01:33:53,736
What do you know about me?

950
01:33:56,039 --> 01:33:59,769
I found her.

951
01:33:59,843 --> 01:34:03,778
You found who?

952
01:34:09,051 --> 01:34:11,645
Your little girl.

953
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:41,044
I found her, man.

954
01:34:45,022 --> 01:34:46,955
I found her.

955
01:35:49,518 --> 01:35:53,454
Yeah, play something happy.
Play something happy.

956
01:35:53,521 --> 01:35:55,489
Yeah. Hello.

957
01:35:58,027 --> 01:36:00,460
Okay, I'll get it,
I'll get it, I'll get it.

958
01:36:07,202 --> 01:36:09,637
- Hi, Christina.
- Hi.

959
01:36:09,704 --> 01:36:14,972
- I'm a little bit early.
- Yeah, th-that's okay. Come on in.

960
01:36:19,949 --> 01:36:22,474
Yeah, I mean,
it's difficult for me to tell...

961
01:36:22,550 --> 01:36:25,315
'cause I never had much of a
musical education myself...

962
01:36:25,387 --> 01:36:28,481
but her teacher thinks
she's really talented.

963
01:36:28,556 --> 01:36:32,583
And actually, we were thinking
of buying her a better piano.

964
01:36:32,661 --> 01:36:35,597
An exotic baby grand, you know?

965
01:36:35,664 --> 01:36:37,929
And when I mentioned "baby grand,"
do you know what she said to me?

966
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:42,436
She said, "Dad,
isn't that a contradiction in terms?"

967
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:45,268
I mean, she just never
ceases to amaze me.

968
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:47,275
I mean, she's eight years old.
Can you imagine?

969
01:36:47,342 --> 01:36:50,039
She can already identify-
Wh-What do you call that when...

970
01:36:50,112 --> 01:36:53,445
it's two words,
kind of cancel each other out?

971
01:36:53,516 --> 01:36:57,782
She just amazes me.

972
01:36:59,855 --> 01:37:04,621
Where's your mind?

973
01:37:04,693 --> 01:37:08,130
I was just thinking.

974
01:37:08,197 --> 01:37:11,462
About what?

975
01:37:11,534 --> 01:37:15,630
About the way you talk about Lisa.

976
01:37:15,704 --> 01:37:18,298
You get so excited.

977
01:37:18,373 --> 01:37:22,309
It's nice.

978
01:37:23,713 --> 01:37:27,443
Well, I'm sure your parents
talk about you that way too.

979
01:37:27,516 --> 01:37:30,576
I don't think so.

980
01:37:30,652 --> 01:37:34,418
Oh, I do.

981
01:37:34,489 --> 01:37:36,583
Why?

982
01:37:36,659 --> 01:37:40,925
Because you're a very
responsible young woman.

983
01:37:40,996 --> 01:37:45,434
Responsible to what?

984
01:37:45,501 --> 01:37:50,268
Well, to whatever it is
you believe you have to do.

985
01:37:50,338 --> 01:37:54,434
Like what?

986
01:37:54,509 --> 01:38:00,346
Well, Lisa loves it when you come
over to baby-sit, for example.

987
01:38:02,518 --> 01:38:06,283
She says you really listen to her.

988
01:38:06,354 --> 01:38:09,288
That's nice.

989
01:38:09,357 --> 01:38:12,053
She really listens to me too.

990
01:38:18,033 --> 01:38:21,093
She thinks you're not very happy.

991
01:38:21,169 --> 01:38:26,629
Listen, Christina,

992
01:38:26,707 --> 01:38:30,906
if there's, if there's ever
anything you want to talk about...

993
01:38:30,979 --> 01:38:34,506
about what might be going on
at home or whatever...

994
01:38:34,582 --> 01:38:39,417
you know that I'm here, okay?

995
01:38:41,321 --> 01:38:43,915
- Okay.
- Okay?

996
01:38:43,991 --> 01:38:46,084
Okay.

997
01:38:51,332 --> 01:38:54,926
Okay.

998
01:39:00,174 --> 01:39:03,406
Oh, no. It's okay.

999
01:39:06,513 --> 01:39:08,607
Thank you.

1000
01:39:16,024 --> 01:39:19,551
You know, I really enjoy
these drives home, Mr. Brown.

1001
01:39:19,627 --> 01:39:23,118
Good, good. So do I.

1002
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:29,067
- Bye, Mr. Brown.
- Good-bye.
