1
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,264
You have to ask yourself...

2
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:12,931
what brought the person to this point.

3
00:02:13,006 --> 00:02:18,501
What was seen in his face,
his manner, that channeled him here.

4
00:02:18,578 --> 00:02:21,638
You have to convince yourself...

5
00:02:21,715 --> 00:02:26,982
that this person has something
hidden that you have to find.

6
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:32,150
You check his bags,
but it's his face...

7
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:35,991
his gestures that
you're really watching.

8
00:02:38,932 --> 00:02:40,957
Thank you.

9
00:02:58,985 --> 00:03:01,419
He's staring straight at you.

10
00:03:01,488 --> 00:03:04,252
Look at him, carefully.

11
00:03:04,324 --> 00:03:06,622
What do you see?

12
00:03:06,693 --> 00:03:10,993
Security 4 to Baggage Claim 17.

13
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:25,109
- Where you headed?
- Uh, downtown.

14
00:03:28,014 --> 00:03:31,608
- You want to split it?
- S-Sure.

15
00:03:43,862 --> 00:03:47,730
What? Not tonight.
Are you sure?

16
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,098
Well, can't you cancel?

17
00:04:02,214 --> 00:04:06,981
Oh. Uh... what are these?

18
00:04:07,052 --> 00:04:09,714
Ballet tickets for tonight.

19
00:04:09,788 --> 00:04:12,655
Oh.

20
00:04:12,725 --> 00:04:17,594
- You don't like ballet?
- Well, some ballets.

21
00:04:17,663 --> 00:04:20,393
Well, that's exactly
what this is: some ballet.

22
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:23,401
Look, you can always scalp
the tickets at the door.

23
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:26,597
Oh, you mean, uh,
take these in exchange...

24
00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:30,733
- for you paying your part of the fare.
- Well, what do you think?

25
00:04:51,797 --> 00:04:54,061
- See ya, John.
- Good night, John.

26
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:56,067
- See you guys.
- See ya.

27
00:05:18,824 --> 00:05:21,418
Christina, here you are.
Hurry and get dressed.

28
00:05:21,493 --> 00:05:23,586
- People are asking for you.
- * Exotica *

29
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,055
- She's right over there. I'll get her.
- * Exotica *

30
00:05:51,123 --> 00:05:53,148
Bye.

31
00:05:57,796 --> 00:06:02,256
Yeah!

32
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:04,564
Let's bring those big, hairy
palms together, gentlemen...

33
00:06:04,636 --> 00:06:06,831
and have a nice,
big round of applause...

34
00:06:06,905 --> 00:06:09,237
for Kali!

35
00:06:09,308 --> 00:06:11,242
Kali.

36
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,244
Yes, indeed. Kali.

37
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:16,076
And you, too, can- You, too,
can have Kali come over to your table...

38
00:06:16,148 --> 00:06:19,913
for only five dollars, where she can
show you the mysteries of her world.

39
00:06:19,984 --> 00:06:24,648
Trust me, gentlemen.
Trust me.

40
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:13,894
Oh! Baby, baby, baby!

41
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:19,068
Ooh! Do it for me, baby!

42
00:07:19,143 --> 00:07:24,911
Oh! My God, that's incredible.
That's incredible.

43
00:07:24,982 --> 00:07:27,416
Let me ask you something, gentlemen.

44
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:31,581
What is it that gives a
schoolgirl her special innocence?

45
00:07:31,656 --> 00:07:37,424
Her sweet fragrance? Fresh flowers...
light as a spring rain?

46
00:07:37,495 --> 00:07:39,929
Oh, my God.
My God.

47
00:07:39,997 --> 00:07:42,591
Or is it her firm, young flesh
inviting your every caress...

48
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:45,101
enticing you to explore...

49
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:50,402
her deepest and most private secrets?

50
00:07:50,474 --> 00:07:55,537
Well, gentlemen, I'm gonna let you
decide that one for yourselves.

51
00:07:55,613 --> 00:07:58,878
Please join me in welcoming a sassy...

52
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,886
bit of jailbait to our stage.

53
00:08:02,954 --> 00:08:07,391
Yes, indeed.

54
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,222
Come out, sweet Chrissy.

55
00:08:10,294 --> 00:08:12,888
Wherever you are, baby,
come on out.

56
00:09:29,306 --> 00:09:34,073
You think you're bad, eh, baby?

57
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:37,443
You're bad.

58
00:09:53,196 --> 00:09:57,599
That will be $5.50.

59
00:10:03,204 --> 00:10:06,271
Thank you.

60
00:11:34,364 --> 00:11:37,856
- Eric?
- What?

61
00:11:37,934 --> 00:11:42,303
Linda finished her dance.

62
00:11:42,372 --> 00:11:46,138
Let's bring those big, hairy
palms together, gentlemen.

63
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:50,305
Give it up.
Yeah, gentlemen. Yes.

64
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:55,715
Have a nice, big round
of applause for Linda. Yeah.

65
00:11:55,784 --> 00:11:58,685
Yes, indeed, Linda.

66
00:11:58,754 --> 00:12:00,984
And just a reminder that there is
nothing Linda would love more...

67
00:12:01,056 --> 00:12:03,422
than to slink over to your table and...

68
00:12:03,492 --> 00:12:07,758
give you your own private
show for only five dollars.

69
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,764
That's right.

70
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:13,893
Five dollars is all it takes to
have one of our beautiful foxes...

71
00:12:13,969 --> 00:12:17,268
come over to your table and
get you all hot and bothered.

72
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:20,103
But, hey, why be bothered...

73
00:12:20,175 --> 00:12:24,441
when you're being treated like a king?

74
00:12:24,513 --> 00:12:29,109
You've had a rough day.

75
00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:32,415
Don't you think you owe it
to yourselves to...

76
00:12:32,488 --> 00:12:36,322
do something that'll make you
feel like you're someone special?

77
00:12:38,393 --> 00:12:42,727
You are someone special.

78
00:12:42,798 --> 00:12:47,258
Five dollars is all
it takes to prove it.

79
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,877
Yes, let's have a nice big
round of applause for Michelle.

80
00:13:31,947 --> 00:13:35,110
My God, that was beautiful.

81
00:13:37,152 --> 00:13:39,643
Ooh, baby, you come out.

82
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:43,157
And just to remind you that, uh, there's
nothing Michelle would love more...

83
00:13:43,225 --> 00:13:45,489
than to come over to your table and
give you your own private dance.

84
00:13:47,896 --> 00:13:50,888
Hello, gentlemen!

85
00:13:50,966 --> 00:13:52,900
Anybody out there?
Anybody alive?

86
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:55,766
Anybody, for five dollars,
you can have Kali.

87
00:13:55,837 --> 00:13:59,967
Kali at your own private table.

88
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,914
Let me ask you something, gentlemen.

89
00:14:06,982 --> 00:14:09,212
What is it about a schoolgirl...

90
00:14:09,284 --> 00:14:12,742
that gives her that special innocence?

91
00:14:16,325 --> 00:14:18,953
Is it the way that
they can gaze at you...

92
00:14:19,027 --> 00:14:23,088
waiting for you to say something
with so much expectation and hope...

93
00:14:23,165 --> 00:14:27,761
that you're just...
you're just paralyzed into...

94
00:14:29,471 --> 00:14:32,838
into silence?

95
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:27,217
- Look, uh, I want to give this back to you.
- Why?

96
00:15:27,295 --> 00:15:30,059
Well, you see,
those tickets were given to me...

97
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:34,898
and, uh, I just feel uncomfortable
about having sold them.

98
00:15:34,969 --> 00:15:37,938
- That's okay.
- No, no, no, really, I-

99
00:15:42,343 --> 00:15:45,278
We never really introduced ourselves.
I'm Thomas.

100
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:47,280
David.

101
00:15:47,348 --> 00:15:49,714
Can I use this
to take you out for a drink?

102
00:15:49,784 --> 00:15:54,653
- Oh, that's, uh, very kind of you, but-
- But what?

103
00:15:54,722 --> 00:15:58,556
But I really have to get home.

104
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,528
Thanks.

105
00:16:41,602 --> 00:16:43,536
Are you available next Thursday?

106
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:45,595
- Uh, I think so, yeah.
- Good, good.

107
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,374
- Tracey?
- Yeah?

108
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:52,708
I'm not that boring, am I?

109
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,716
- What do you mean?
- Well, the earphones.

110
00:16:56,784 --> 00:16:59,480
I mean, we used to listen
to the radio...

111
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:03,512
and you used to ask me
all sorts of questions.

112
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:06,287
So you want me to ask more questions?

113
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:11,659
Sure. Yeah, I mean, if there's
something y-you want to know.

114
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:15,231
Okay. I'll see
what I can think up.

115
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:17,327
- Say hi to your dad.
- I will.

116
00:17:17,405 --> 00:17:19,339
- Good night.
- Good night.

117
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:43,694
- Did someone say something?
- No.

118
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,958
So, what's the point?

119
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:49,365
I've just noticed
a change in your attitude.

120
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,001
Look, I would understand if you would
prefer not to introduce Christina.

121
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:01,513
I could do it myself.

122
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,913
Actually, I've been thinking
that, perhaps...

123
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:08,317
I should be getting more involved
in the introductions overall.

124
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,621
I could have my own microphone,
like my mother used to do.

125
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,992
No, I mean, I actually
enjoy introducing Christina.

126
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,691
I mean, I find it
very therapeutic, you know?

127
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:23,827
- That's not what you're getting paid for.
- Well, it seems to me...

128
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:28,135
that I'm being paid to make every girl seem
like she's something special, right?

129
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:33,407
So, in order to do that,
I have to let my imagination run wild.

130
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:39,043
So, I mean, when it comes
to Christina, I, you know-

131
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,814
My imagination is bound
to run a little wilder.

132
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:44,618
There's nothing that I can
do to control that, Zoe.

133
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:47,353
Makes the clients uncomfortable.

134
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:50,123
And you think your state
puts them at ease?

135
00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:01,807
Hey.

136
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,706
Is he kicking?

137
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:10,215
All the time.

138
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,614
Do you feel like touching it?

139
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,468
Oh.

140
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:40,977
How are you feeling about this?

141
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:44,574
- Fine.
- Fine?

142
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:47,279
Are you happy?

143
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,480
For you.

144
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:55,589
What about you, Eric?
What about you?

145
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,055
Well, I guess I got to be pretty
careful about my feelings, right?

146
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:03,466
I mean, uh...

147
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:07,597
that's why we have
a contract, isn't it?

148
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,705
There's plaster dust
all over the apartment.

149
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:19,615
No, I'm not exaggerating. No, I was
coughing in my sleep last night.

150
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,779
You told me that it was going to be
comfortable for me to live there...

151
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,947
and it is not comfortable.

152
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:26,957
There's plastic on the furniture.

153
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:30,119
That is not comfortable living.

154
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:33,255
Yeah.
Oh, come on, look.

155
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:37,496
You told me you were going to strip the
wallpaper, not strip the walls down.

156
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,504
Well, no, if you'd,
if you'd told me in the first place-

157
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,063
If you'd told me what kind of job it was,
then I would have considered it.

158
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:47,475
Although, it's- it makes me seem
like you've maybe made a mistake.

159
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,640
That's what it makes me suspect.

160
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,650
What? No, it's too late now.
It's inaccessible.

161
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,690
I'm not gonna pay you. Pay you for what?
You didn't do the job.

162
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,955
Well, you did a job, but it's not
the job that I asked you to do.

163
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,792
It's not the job we agreed on.

164
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:09,095
Well, I can get anyone,
any number of people to do this.

165
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:13,160
Yeah, that's just fine with me.

166
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,939
Yeah, can I help you?

167
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,473
- Mr. Pinto?
- Uh, yes.

168
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:28,349
I'm Francis Brown. We spoke, uh,
on the phone a couple of weeks ago.

169
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:32,948
- Revenue Canada.
- Oh, uh, of course. Uh-

170
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:37,086
- How was your trip?
- Oh, it was fine.

171
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:40,495
- And when did you get back?
- Um, just yesterday.

172
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:43,500
Good weather?

173
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:47,129
Yes, yes, lovely. Yeah.

174
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:50,038
- Is this a good time, Mr. Pinto?
- Oh, sure.

175
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:54,602
- It's just that you seem a little, uh-
- A little what?

176
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,274
- Flustered.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

177
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,113
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

178
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,119
Good.

179
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:08,811
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

180
00:22:08,812 --> 00:22:11,627
Listen, I can't talk to you right now. L-Later.

181
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,275
Okay, uh-

182
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:46,058
So this is where I'd find
all the bank statements?

183
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:46,529
Uh-

184
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:49,863
Yeah, that's right,
and those there.

185
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:56,570
Okay. Well, if I have any questions,
I'll let you know.

186
00:22:58,576 --> 00:23:00,669
- Is it a little hot for you back here?
- It's, uh, yeah.

187
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:04,977
You could turn it down a tad.

188
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:10,578
I suppose you have to be pretty careful
with the temperature with the animals.

189
00:23:10,654 --> 00:23:13,248
Oh, well, they're a lot hardier
than you'd think.

190
00:23:15,993 --> 00:23:18,928
I wouldn't think they're not hardy.

191
00:23:18,996 --> 00:23:24,764
I mean, just because they're exotic
doesn't mean they can't endure extremes.

192
00:23:24,835 --> 00:23:28,931
It is, after all,
a jungle out there, isn't it?

193
00:23:32,576 --> 00:23:35,841
Um, so, how long
will this take?

194
00:23:35,913 --> 00:23:39,076
- An audit?
- Yes.

195
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:42,313
Well, it depends on
how prepared you are.

196
00:23:42,386 --> 00:23:44,285
Have you got an accountant?

197
00:23:44,286 --> 00:23:47,380
Uh, well, um, no.
Well, no, not really, no.

198
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:50,450
Not really?

199
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:54,055
- So this will take, uh, a while?
- I could be done by the end of the day.

200
00:23:54,131 --> 00:23:57,794
Or it might take a week.
It's difficult to say.

201
00:23:57,868 --> 00:24:01,872
Oh. Okay. Uh, well,
if you have any questions, um-

202
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,363
I'll let you know.

203
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:42,745
Did you know her?

204
00:24:44,248 --> 00:24:47,081
Sort of.

205
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:50,609
She was your neighbor?

206
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:54,351
I, uh, I baby-sat her
a couple times.

207
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:58,384
Oh, so you knew her pretty well, eh?

208
00:24:58,462 --> 00:25:01,898
Yeah. I did.

209
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:03,900
What about you?

210
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:09,338
Oh, I just, uh, I heard this
thing was being organized, so-

211
00:25:09,406 --> 00:25:12,398
It seems so, uh...

212
00:25:12,476 --> 00:25:15,240
surreal, doesn't it?

213
00:25:15,312 --> 00:25:18,748
- What?
- That we'd find anything.

214
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:24,413
I mean, there's so, uh, many places you
could hide something in this country.

215
00:25:24,488 --> 00:25:29,255
- My name's Eric.
- I'm Christina.

216
00:25:29,326 --> 00:25:32,295
Hey, nice to meet you, Christina.

217
00:25:45,975 --> 00:25:49,274
Well?

218
00:25:49,345 --> 00:25:52,906
- Well, what?
- Don't you want to touch it?

219
00:25:54,784 --> 00:25:59,847
You don't have to. It's one of those
things people normally like to do.

220
00:25:59,923 --> 00:26:02,653
Ah.

221
00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:17,864
What is this thing about Eric calling
you "a sassy piece of jailbait"?

222
00:26:17,941 --> 00:26:21,536
- What's this thing?
- It bothers me.

223
00:26:21,611 --> 00:26:22,452
Why?

224
00:26:22,453 --> 00:26:24,978
It makes you out like
a child or something.

225
00:26:25,048 --> 00:26:30,281
Unlike the tartan skirt and my socks
or the blouse or the way I act, right?

226
00:26:33,456 --> 00:26:37,790
Do you find it strange that he
would still want to work here?

227
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:43,457
Zoe, not all of us have the luxury of
deciding what to do with our lives.

228
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:46,627
It's a job, and he's
getting paid all right.

229
00:26:46,703 --> 00:26:49,263
I just find it cruel.

230
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:51,899
So fire him.

231
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,873
As a favor.

232
00:26:56,946 --> 00:26:59,881
How can you be so detached?

233
00:28:36,945 --> 00:28:39,505
Well, I'm finished for the day.

234
00:28:39,581 --> 00:28:43,779
Uh, for the day?
Uh, you mean you have to come back?

235
00:28:43,852 --> 00:28:46,719
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

236
00:28:46,788 --> 00:28:49,052
When is a good time?

237
00:28:49,124 --> 00:28:51,592
But, but, I thought you said it
was only going to take one day.

238
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,390
Well, it can only take a day.

239
00:28:54,463 --> 00:28:58,297
But you have to understand, you don't
keep very well-organized books.

240
00:28:58,366 --> 00:29:00,857
That's why you should really think
about getting someone in to help you.

241
00:29:00,936 --> 00:29:04,133
Just somebody to come in
once or twice a week...

242
00:29:04,206 --> 00:29:10,111
depending on the amount of activity
and... the type of activity.

243
00:29:10,178 --> 00:29:13,170
Uh, what do you mean by that?

244
00:29:13,248 --> 00:29:16,411
Well, some types of activity are
more complicated, aren't they?

245
00:29:16,485 --> 00:29:19,454
It might take more effort
to account for.

246
00:29:19,521 --> 00:29:21,455
Oh.

247
00:29:21,523 --> 00:29:24,549
I found a gun in one of the drawers.

248
00:29:24,626 --> 00:29:30,030
- Oh, well, that belonged to my dad.
- Your dad?

249
00:29:30,098 --> 00:29:34,330
Yeah, I guess he just kept it,
uh, just in case.

250
00:29:34,402 --> 00:29:39,169
- In case of what?
- Well, in case of trouble.

251
00:29:39,241 --> 00:29:41,539
With the animals?

252
00:29:45,447 --> 00:29:48,075
Would Monday be a good time
for me to come back...

253
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:51,642
- Mr. Pinto?
- Oh, yeah.

254
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,745
Well, how about, uh, tomorrow?

255
00:29:53,822 --> 00:29:55,643
Uh, I have appointments for tomorrow.

256
00:29:55,644 --> 00:29:58,054
Actually, I'm pretty
busy 'til the end of the week.

257
00:29:58,126 --> 00:30:00,185
Monday's not good?

258
00:30:00,262 --> 00:30:02,890
No, uh, Monday's fine.

259
00:30:02,964 --> 00:30:05,330
- Around 10:00?
- Yeah, sure.

260
00:30:08,236 --> 00:30:10,864
Well, good.
Have a nice weekend.

261
00:30:39,634 --> 00:30:42,501
Strange to think that bird is
probably going to outlive us.

262
00:30:42,571 --> 00:30:45,938
Strange?

263
00:30:46,007 --> 00:30:49,238
Did you ever teach it to say anything?

264
00:30:49,311 --> 00:30:51,245
Yes.

265
00:30:54,382 --> 00:30:59,115
- What does it say, Harold?
- It doesn't really say it anymore.

266
00:30:59,187 --> 00:31:01,087
It forgot?

267
00:31:02,857 --> 00:31:07,851
I don't think so.
They're not supposed to forget.

268
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:10,864
It must have just lost interest.

269
00:31:13,868 --> 00:31:17,599
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- It's okay. We're just talking about Felix.

270
00:31:17,672 --> 00:31:20,037
What about him?

271
00:31:20,107 --> 00:31:22,439
Dad?

272
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:27,310
I had the piano tuned.
It sounds beautiful.

273
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,774
So, how does it sound?

274
00:31:55,843 --> 00:31:58,607
- It's good.
- Yeah? Good, good.

275
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:02,115
- Okay, well, I shouldn't be too late.
- What's "too late"?

276
00:32:02,182 --> 00:32:05,618
- Around 11:00 or so?
- Okay.

277
00:32:37,885 --> 00:32:41,150
You looking for tickets?

278
00:32:41,221 --> 00:32:43,917
Uh, yeah. How much?

279
00:33:50,157 --> 00:33:53,251
That's too hot.

280
00:34:15,248 --> 00:34:18,615
He comes in here every other night.

281
00:34:19,185 --> 00:34:22,951
He has his favorite drink...

282
00:34:23,022 --> 00:34:27,618
at his favorite table
with his favorite dancer.

283
00:34:29,362 --> 00:34:35,130
Sometimes he has to wait for her,
and sometimes she's waiting for him.

284
00:34:35,201 --> 00:34:39,638
She'll protect him.
She's his angel.

285
00:34:46,145 --> 00:34:50,241
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
it's show time at the Exotica.

286
00:34:50,316 --> 00:34:52,910
And just to remind you that
five dollars is all it takes...

287
00:34:52,985 --> 00:34:57,581
to have one of our lovely ladies
come over to your table...

288
00:34:57,657 --> 00:35:02,594
and show you the mysteries
of their world.

289
00:36:16,502 --> 00:36:20,905
Now if that didn't turn you
on, gentlemen, nothing will.

290
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:26,605
Oh, let's have a nice, big, warm round
of applause for Christina, gentlemen!

291
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:29,079
Yes, Christina!

292
00:36:51,304 --> 00:36:55,399
What are you thinking?

293
00:36:55,473 --> 00:36:59,910
I was just thinking,
what would happen if someone hurt you?

294
00:37:03,315 --> 00:37:07,581
H-How could anyone hurt me?

295
00:37:07,652 --> 00:37:12,749
If I'm not there to protect you.

296
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:20,621
I- You'll always be there to protect me.

297
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:51,554
An angel.

298
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,565
Shh.

299
00:37:59,304 --> 00:38:03,570
Why would somebody want
to do something like that?

300
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:10,748
How could somebody even think
of doing something like that?

301
00:38:10,815 --> 00:38:14,751
You mustn't worry.

302
00:38:30,502 --> 00:38:33,596
Eric! Eric!

303
00:38:33,672 --> 00:38:35,936
Oh.

304
00:38:36,007 --> 00:38:41,741
All hot and bothered, yes, indeed.

305
00:38:41,813 --> 00:38:47,274
Let's have a nice, big
round of applause for Melinda.

306
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:45,775
Uh, listen, I feel bad about,
uh, taking your money.

307
00:39:45,843 --> 00:39:50,280
- Why?
- The tickets were given to me, and...

308
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:53,282
I should have given them away for free.

309
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:56,444
- Well, that would have been stupid.
- Why?

310
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,284
Because no one gives anything away.

311
00:40:00,858 --> 00:40:04,726
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, p-positive.

312
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:32,321
Do you consider my dad a friend?

313
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:35,756
- Why?
- J-Just asking.

314
00:40:35,826 --> 00:40:38,659
Does he consider me a friend?

315
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:41,664
I don't know.

316
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:43,825
Why not?

317
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:47,769
'Cause he always seems
different when you're around.

318
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:52,172
- Different in what way?
- J- Tense.

319
00:40:54,511 --> 00:40:56,445
Is that bad?

320
00:40:56,513 --> 00:41:00,779
Well, I don't really like to
feel tense around my friends.

321
00:41:00,851 --> 00:41:03,115
Well, sure, yeah.

322
00:41:03,187 --> 00:41:06,418
I didn't like to feel tense around my
friends when I was your age either.

323
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:09,789
But you do now?

324
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,421
No, it's not a question
of liking it or not.

325
00:41:13,497 --> 00:41:17,126
It's just something that happens.

326
00:41:17,201 --> 00:41:19,465
Why?

327
00:41:21,038 --> 00:41:25,634
Um...

328
00:41:25,709 --> 00:41:30,305
well... as you get older...

329
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:35,317
you become aware that the people
you meet and the person you are...

330
00:41:35,385 --> 00:41:39,583
um, as carrying
a certain amount of baggage.

331
00:41:39,656 --> 00:41:44,320
And, and that baggage creates tension.

332
00:41:44,394 --> 00:41:47,761
So what do you do about it?

333
00:41:47,831 --> 00:41:50,459
Well, you can pretend it's not there...

334
00:41:50,534 --> 00:41:54,265
or you can choose not to have friends...

335
00:41:54,338 --> 00:41:58,672
or you can acknowledge that it's
there and have friends anyway.

336
00:41:58,742 --> 00:42:01,108
Like my dad?

337
00:42:02,613 --> 00:42:04,945
Right.

338
00:42:05,015 --> 00:42:09,247
I don't think that I like
my dad when he's around you.

339
00:42:11,855 --> 00:42:15,450
Hmm.

340
00:42:15,525 --> 00:42:17,618
Well, that's...

341
00:42:17,694 --> 00:42:22,290
because your dad doesn't like
himself when he's around me.

342
00:42:22,366 --> 00:42:24,300
But that's okay.

343
00:42:24,368 --> 00:42:28,235
That's... part of what
friends do to each other.

344
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:34,968
- Good night.
- Good night.

345
00:43:02,738 --> 00:43:04,763
I, uh- I just graduated.

346
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,774
Really?
So did I.

347
00:43:06,842 --> 00:43:10,778
- Oh, yeah? In what?
- Radio communications.

348
00:43:10,846 --> 00:43:14,441
- So, so is that what you do?
- That's what I'd like to do.

349
00:43:14,517 --> 00:43:17,782
Uh, I do a little
freelance deejay stuff...

350
00:43:17,853 --> 00:43:20,947
but, you know, right now
I'm just driving a cab.

351
00:43:21,023 --> 00:43:23,832
I thought you might
do something like that.

352
00:43:23,833 --> 00:43:24,789
Drive a cab?

353
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:28,562
No, do something
where, you use your voice.

354
00:43:28,563 --> 00:43:29,797
Why?

355
00:43:29,865 --> 00:43:34,734
I don't know why.
Because you're easy to listen to.

356
00:43:34,804 --> 00:43:38,296
Because of my voice, eh?

357
00:43:56,826 --> 00:44:00,922
I just need to find
a structure, you know?

358
00:44:00,997 --> 00:44:02,931
What do you mean?

359
00:44:02,999 --> 00:44:07,595
Listen, I waste so much time, you know?
I just- My days just slip by, you know?

360
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:11,800
- Isn't that what days are supposed to do?
- Yeah.

361
00:44:11,874 --> 00:44:15,275
Not if you want to make
something of yourself, you know?

362
00:44:15,344 --> 00:44:19,440
What do you want to make of yourself?

363
00:44:19,515 --> 00:44:23,952
I don't know. I just feel that I was
meant to do something with my time.

364
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:28,787
I mean, otherwise, I wouldn't be
thinking of this this way.

365
00:44:28,858 --> 00:44:33,124
I'd be able to just continue
what I was doing, you know?

366
00:44:40,369 --> 00:44:45,136
Do you have a lot of friends?

367
00:44:46,942 --> 00:44:50,878
Not really. Do you?

368
00:44:50,946 --> 00:44:54,245
- No.
- Yeah.

369
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:59,549
Do you ever feel like you need a friend?

370
00:44:59,622 --> 00:45:03,080
Yeah, sometimes.

371
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:06,219
When?

372
00:45:06,295 --> 00:45:08,889
Like right now.

373
00:45:08,964 --> 00:45:11,728
Why?

374
00:45:11,801 --> 00:45:14,894
'Cause I just met you and...

375
00:45:14,969 --> 00:45:18,405
I just feel like
telling someone, you know?

376
00:45:58,613 --> 00:46:02,709
No way.
No way, no way.

377
00:46:05,453 --> 00:46:07,546
- Hi.
- Hi.

378
00:46:07,622 --> 00:46:10,716
- Jesus.
- What's the matter?

379
00:46:10,792 --> 00:46:14,023
"What's the matter?"
Her wigs, her clothes.

380
00:46:14,095 --> 00:46:18,225
Sometimes I just feel like
throwing them all away, you know?

381
00:46:18,299 --> 00:46:20,392
What are you looking for, Zoe?

382
00:46:25,974 --> 00:46:28,738
- I mean, is this where you see your future?
- My future?

383
00:46:30,812 --> 00:46:32,746
The club?

384
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:40,911
When Mom died, my immediate idea was
to get rid of this place. Just sell it.

385
00:46:40,989 --> 00:46:44,863
I never thought it would
have any interest for me.

386
00:46:44,864 --> 00:46:46,154
So why did it?

387
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:55,031
I used to be very shy as a child.

388
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:57,697
I used to watch my mother for hours...

389
00:46:57,772 --> 00:47:01,538
just admiring her sense of freedom.

390
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:07,146
So when the opportunity came up,
I thought I would take on the challenge.

391
00:47:07,215 --> 00:47:12,084
So you feel better about adopting her
options rather than creating your own?

392
00:47:13,955 --> 00:47:16,116
I have created my own options too.

393
00:47:16,191 --> 00:47:18,557
Oh, I know.

394
00:47:27,168 --> 00:47:30,831
It's your contract
for the baby with Eric.

395
00:47:30,905 --> 00:47:33,271
I found it.

396
00:47:33,341 --> 00:47:36,401
Does he know?

397
00:47:36,477 --> 00:47:38,843
I would hope so.

398
00:47:38,913 --> 00:47:43,850
Otherwise he might just think I'm disgusted
with him for no particular reason.

399
00:47:46,087 --> 00:47:49,420
Look, I really desperately
needed this child...

400
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:52,516
and it just worked out with Eric.

401
00:47:52,594 --> 00:47:55,222
I didn't mean to hurt you.

402
00:47:55,296 --> 00:47:58,925
You know, I remember when your
mother built this hallway.

403
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,232
She, uh, she built it for this very
rich man who used to come here.

404
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:10,032
He used to get off watching us dance for
other guys, so he actually paid her...

405
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:13,637
to construct this very special
place that he could watch us from.

406
00:48:15,415 --> 00:48:17,645
Your mother never told us that.

407
00:48:17,718 --> 00:48:20,312
She said it was to protect us...

408
00:48:20,387 --> 00:48:23,322
so she could patrol things.

409
00:48:26,593 --> 00:48:28,720
And I believed her.

410
00:48:30,297 --> 00:48:32,891
Until Eric told me the truth.

411
00:48:35,836 --> 00:48:37,770
Why did you believe him?

412
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:40,238
I made a choice.

413
00:48:43,243 --> 00:48:47,839
And Eric promised me
he'd never lie to me.

414
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:33,248
How could anyone...

415
00:49:33,327 --> 00:49:35,761
hurt you?

416
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,235
Take you away from me?

417
00:49:48,175 --> 00:49:50,803
How could anyone?

418
00:50:38,658 --> 00:50:41,627
What's this machine?

419
00:50:41,695 --> 00:50:44,630
Uh, uh, it's an incubator.

420
00:50:44,698 --> 00:50:49,464
- Wh-What's it for?
- Well, what do you think it's for?

421
00:50:49,535 --> 00:50:52,060
- Eggs.
- That's right.

422
00:50:52,138 --> 00:50:55,198
Are they yours?

423
00:50:55,274 --> 00:50:57,868
Wh-What do you mean?

424
00:50:57,943 --> 00:51:01,688
I mean, shouldn't you be
sitting on them or something?

425
00:51:01,689 --> 00:51:02,505
Oh, yeah.

426
00:51:02,581 --> 00:51:05,880
Well, I guess I've abandoned the nest.

427
00:51:15,294 --> 00:51:20,391
What's inside of them?

428
00:51:20,466 --> 00:51:24,562
- Uh, the eggs?
- Yes.

429
00:51:24,637 --> 00:51:27,231
Well, uh, Hyacinth Macaws...

430
00:51:27,306 --> 00:51:30,173
if you want to know the absolute truth.

431
00:51:30,242 --> 00:51:32,836
And where did you get them?

432
00:51:32,912 --> 00:51:38,680
From... very far away.

433
00:51:53,766 --> 00:51:56,860
Hey, check her out, eh?

434
00:51:59,772 --> 00:52:02,969
I said check her out.

435
00:52:03,042 --> 00:52:07,206
- Yeah.
- You talking to me?

436
00:52:07,279 --> 00:52:11,215
Uh, yes,
I'm talking to you.

437
00:52:13,285 --> 00:52:15,549
What? Check who out?

438
00:52:15,621 --> 00:52:18,317
The babe that's dancing for you, man.

439
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:22,554
You've given her quite a run
for your money, man.

440
00:52:22,628 --> 00:52:25,392
What do you mean by that?

441
00:52:25,464 --> 00:52:29,491
- She's been dancing for you all night.
- Yeah.

442
00:52:29,568 --> 00:52:33,561
Yeah, and not just tonight. I mean, I've
noticed you with her other nights too.

443
00:52:36,575 --> 00:52:40,102
You come in here all the time or-

444
00:52:40,179 --> 00:52:44,843
Uh... yeah.
All the time.

445
00:52:44,917 --> 00:52:49,513
This- Visuals, you know?
It's good.

446
00:52:49,588 --> 00:52:52,853
But, uh...

447
00:52:52,925 --> 00:52:57,760
she seems to have a bit of a
thing for you, doesn't she?

448
00:52:59,598 --> 00:53:03,159
We, uh... get along.

449
00:53:03,235 --> 00:53:07,365
I'm sure you do, my friend.

450
00:53:07,439 --> 00:53:11,205
What do you two talk about, huh?

451
00:53:11,277 --> 00:53:16,874
Oh, just, uh...
the usual, I guess.

452
00:53:16,949 --> 00:53:18,883
The usual?

453
00:53:18,951 --> 00:53:23,888
I don't think you're talking
about what I would call "usual."

454
00:53:23,956 --> 00:53:26,720
- Why not?
- Because I can tell.

455
00:53:26,792 --> 00:53:30,319
You get pretty intense,
my friend.

456
00:53:30,396 --> 00:53:32,921
Well, I guess that's just the way I am.

457
00:53:36,568 --> 00:53:41,835
So, uh- Hey, wh-why don't you
give her a little touch, huh?

458
00:53:41,906 --> 00:53:47,674
- You're not supposed to touch.
- Ah, but she is into it, believe me.

459
00:53:47,745 --> 00:53:51,010
Yeah.

460
00:53:51,082 --> 00:53:56,520
- How do you know?
- Everybody knows, man.

461
00:53:56,588 --> 00:53:59,318
Trust me, my friend.

462
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:03,349
Trust me.
Just a little touch.

463
00:54:03,428 --> 00:54:07,524
Nothing too drastic.

464
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,865
Then you will get
the full experience, my friend...

465
00:54:11,936 --> 00:54:14,496
and you will love it.

466
00:54:14,572 --> 00:54:19,032
You will love it. Okay?

467
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:23,774
And what happens when I touch her?

468
00:54:23,848 --> 00:54:28,376
What happens?

469
00:55:03,921 --> 00:55:07,618
You're outta here, man!
Get out!

470
00:55:10,928 --> 00:55:13,692
Come on.
Get down there.

471
00:55:13,765 --> 00:55:16,427
Come on. Go.

472
00:55:32,185 --> 00:55:34,778
Hey, what the hell you doin'?
Get off the road!

473
00:55:40,025 --> 00:55:43,188
Move!

474
00:56:03,215 --> 00:56:05,480
What's so funny?

475
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:08,644
It's like pettin' a gorilla.

476
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,485
Well-

477
00:56:11,556 --> 00:56:14,492
Was your father this hairy?

478
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:18,656
No, I, uh, I got it
from my mother.

479
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:21,164
I mean, I mean,
from my mother's side of the family.

480
00:56:21,232 --> 00:56:27,000
That's where you, um,
inherit hair patterns.

481
00:56:27,071 --> 00:56:31,941
- My uncle's bald.
- On your mother's side?

482
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:34,444
Mm-hmm.

483
00:56:34,513 --> 00:56:38,278
Well, um, I guess I'm talking
about usual patterns.

484
00:56:38,349 --> 00:56:42,787
- Hmm.
- There's always exceptions.

485
00:56:42,854 --> 00:56:45,447
That's-

486
00:56:45,524 --> 00:56:50,962
That's the way these things... work.

487
00:57:01,873 --> 00:57:04,706
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

488
00:57:04,775 --> 00:57:07,801
No, I'm fine.

489
00:57:07,879 --> 00:57:11,814
You don't look fine.

490
00:57:11,882 --> 00:57:15,182
You worry about me,
don't you?

491
00:57:15,253 --> 00:57:19,313
You think this is normal?

492
00:57:19,391 --> 00:57:23,623
- What?
- What we do.

493
00:57:26,063 --> 00:57:28,429
What do we do?

494
00:57:30,501 --> 00:57:33,334
That's just it.
We don't speak about it.

495
00:57:33,405 --> 00:57:39,275
You know that feeling
you get sometimes, Tracey...

496
00:57:39,343 --> 00:57:42,574
that you didn't ask to be
brought into the world?

497
00:57:44,348 --> 00:57:46,282
Yeah.

498
00:57:48,186 --> 00:57:50,381
Well, then who did?

499
00:57:50,455 --> 00:57:52,615
What?

500
00:57:52,691 --> 00:57:55,056
If you think that you didn't ask...

501
00:57:55,127 --> 00:57:59,062
to be brought into the world...

502
00:57:59,131 --> 00:58:01,691
then who did?

503
00:58:15,847 --> 00:58:20,978
All I'm saying is nobody asked you if
you wanted to be brought into the world.

504
00:58:21,051 --> 00:58:24,488
You just ended up getting here.

505
00:58:26,557 --> 00:58:30,585
So the question is,
now that you're here...

506
00:58:30,662 --> 00:58:34,598
who's asking you to stay?

507
00:58:45,176 --> 00:58:48,111
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

508
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:51,478
Look, are you sure you're gonna be okay?

509
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:54,450
Yes.

510
00:58:54,519 --> 00:58:56,509
Good night.

511
00:59:01,693 --> 00:59:03,627
Good night.

512
00:59:12,436 --> 00:59:14,460
- He touched you?
- He didn't want to.

513
00:59:14,537 --> 00:59:17,530
- What do you mean?
- I know him.

514
00:59:17,608 --> 00:59:22,602
- We all know him. He's crazy about you.
- Not like that.

515
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,841
Why didn't you get one of the
boys to handle this, Eric?

516
00:59:24,914 --> 00:59:28,145
Because I didn't think of it.

517
00:59:28,218 --> 00:59:30,686
I just saw him touch her, and-

518
00:59:30,753 --> 00:59:32,745
Why didn't you ask him to leave?

519
00:59:32,823 --> 00:59:35,018
- Because he wouldn't have listened.
- How do you know that?

520
00:59:35,091 --> 00:59:38,084
Because he's in his own world,
the ass-wipe.

521
00:59:38,162 --> 00:59:40,357
I don't know where
you're both coming from.

522
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:44,765
You are telling me that he touched you,
but he really didn't.

523
00:59:44,835 --> 00:59:48,362
And you're saying that you overreacted,
but you didn't have a choice?

524
00:59:48,438 --> 00:59:52,205
- I didn't.
- Why not?

525
00:59:52,275 --> 00:59:57,737
Why not?
Because he touched you.

526
00:59:57,814 --> 01:00:01,114
Okay.

527
01:00:01,184 --> 01:00:03,813
All I'm concerned about
is if he makes a case...

528
01:00:03,886 --> 01:00:07,617
I have to know what happened.

529
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:09,749
We told you what happened, Zoe.

530
01:00:09,826 --> 01:00:12,955
And that is what happened?

531
01:00:18,201 --> 01:00:21,660
- Yeah.
- Okay.

532
01:00:21,739 --> 01:00:24,605
Is that it?

533
01:00:27,544 --> 01:00:29,636
Hi. This is Thomas.

534
01:00:29,712 --> 01:00:31,977
I am not in at the present time,
but I am in town.

535
01:00:32,049 --> 01:00:36,816
Please leave a message
following the beep.

536
01:00:36,886 --> 01:00:38,979
Good morning.

537
01:00:39,056 --> 01:00:43,492
You're probably not up yet,
so you haven't seen what I've done.

538
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:47,155
I'm a customs officer at the airport.

539
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:52,328
Actually, I saw you the other day when
you were having your bags inspected.

540
01:00:52,402 --> 01:00:56,338
I know- I know how you probably
smuggled those eggs in.

541
01:00:56,407 --> 01:01:01,174
There's a special unit at work. I think
they give them to the zoo or something.

542
01:01:01,244 --> 01:01:06,181
They asked me where I got them.
I had to lie.

543
01:01:06,249 --> 01:01:08,184
Where are they?

544
01:01:08,251 --> 01:01:10,845
- I took them.
- Where?

545
01:01:10,921 --> 01:01:13,855
- I'd like to see you again.
- Oh, no.

546
01:01:13,924 --> 01:01:16,722
Uh, no, they're in the country now.
Uh, they're definitely in the country.

547
01:01:16,794 --> 01:01:19,126
It's just I don't have
them, uh, with me presently,

548
01:01:19,127 --> 01:01:20,696
but it doesn't mean I can't get them.

549
01:01:20,763 --> 01:01:24,028
- And if you can give me, like,
uh, just, uh, um, a couple-

550
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:27,195
- Good morning.
- Hi. Uh, and, uh, I'm here. Okay.

551
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:30,297
So I'll call-
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

552
01:01:30,374 --> 01:01:32,808
You look like you're
in worse shape than I am.

553
01:01:32,876 --> 01:01:35,970
Uh... what happened to you?

554
01:01:36,046 --> 01:01:38,809
Oh, I fell down some stairs and-

555
01:01:38,881 --> 01:01:42,477
- Are you okay?
- Well, do I look okay?

556
01:01:42,552 --> 01:01:43,633
Uh, no, not really.

557
01:01:43,634 --> 01:01:46,989
Well, I'm better than I look.
Here, I got you a coffee.

558
01:01:47,056 --> 01:01:49,821
I didn't, uh-
I didn't know how you took it.

559
01:01:49,893 --> 01:01:52,157
- Oh, black's fine.
- Oh.

560
01:01:52,229 --> 01:01:55,322
- Uh, I added cream.
- Oh, that's okay.

561
01:01:55,397 --> 01:01:59,163
- No, here, have mine. No, I insist.
- No, really-

562
01:02:02,738 --> 01:02:04,832
What is it?

563
01:02:04,906 --> 01:02:09,002
Well, it's just that
this has cream in it too.

564
01:02:09,077 --> 01:02:11,671
It's milk.

565
01:02:11,748 --> 01:02:14,512
Oh. Oh, good.

566
01:02:14,584 --> 01:02:16,517
Okay, well, I'll, uh-

567
01:02:16,586 --> 01:02:19,521
I'll get to work.

568
01:03:03,899 --> 01:03:06,493
Mmm, what?

569
01:03:06,569 --> 01:03:09,002
What is it?

570
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:13,666
What is it that gives a
schoolgirl her special innocence?

571
01:03:15,411 --> 01:03:19,346
Is it the way they smell?

572
01:03:19,414 --> 01:03:24,351
The sweet smell
of their perfume, of their hair?

573
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:28,913
The aroma of fresh flowers...

574
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:30,959
and all that other stuff
that hasn't been fucked up...

575
01:03:31,026 --> 01:03:34,462
by late nights and a lot of bad food.

576
01:03:37,365 --> 01:03:43,134
Is it their gestures...
and the way they move?

577
01:03:43,206 --> 01:03:48,303
The way their body still holds on to
some semblance of self-respect and...

578
01:03:48,377 --> 01:03:52,142
and dignity?

579
01:03:52,214 --> 01:03:56,481
When they wrap their
beautiful legs around you...

580
01:03:56,551 --> 01:04:00,488
tight and holding on,
looking at you...

581
01:04:00,555 --> 01:04:02,489
you looking at them.

582
01:04:02,557 --> 01:04:05,823
It's just-

583
01:04:05,895 --> 01:04:08,658
Or is it whatever comes out
of their cute little mouths?

584
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:12,166
All those questions,
all that wondering that-

585
01:04:17,239 --> 01:04:18,872
It's just,
you know, you--

586
01:04:18,873 --> 01:04:21,835
They got their whole lives
ahead of them, you know?

587
01:04:21,911 --> 01:04:25,347
And you've wasted half of yours away.

588
01:04:25,414 --> 01:04:27,348
Damn.

589
01:04:29,084 --> 01:04:31,177
What is it?

590
01:04:33,689 --> 01:04:36,782
There's this feeling
I get sometimes, you know?

591
01:04:36,858 --> 01:04:39,453
What sort of feeling?

592
01:04:39,528 --> 01:04:44,464
That I wasn't ever meant
to be satisfied.

593
01:04:44,532 --> 01:04:47,626
Satisfied with what?

594
01:04:47,702 --> 01:04:50,136
A lot of things.

595
01:04:50,204 --> 01:04:52,639
I mean, it seems to me that
every time I'm about to...

596
01:04:52,707 --> 01:04:57,144
you know, get a hold
of something or someone...

597
01:04:57,212 --> 01:05:02,478
it's just bound to slip away.

598
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:05,145
Maybe you want it to slip away.

599
01:05:05,219 --> 01:05:08,484
Maybe I want what to slip away?

600
01:05:08,556 --> 01:05:13,654
The things that you think
you're about to have.

601
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:17,493
What would you think about that?

602
01:05:17,565 --> 01:05:20,660
As a general philosophy...

603
01:05:20,734 --> 01:05:22,998
or how it pertains to you?

604
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:26,165
You think you could talk
about how it pertains to me?

605
01:05:26,241 --> 01:05:28,674
What do you mean?

606
01:05:28,742 --> 01:05:32,770
Well, I feel like I want you.

607
01:05:32,847 --> 01:05:37,944
Do you think that means
you'll slip away?

608
01:05:43,692 --> 01:05:46,387
Dad?

609
01:05:46,461 --> 01:05:51,227
I'm not going to baby-sit
for Uncle Francis anymore.

610
01:05:51,299 --> 01:05:54,462
Baby-sit?
You go there to practice.

611
01:05:54,535 --> 01:05:57,800
That's absurd.

612
01:05:57,872 --> 01:06:00,271
Why?

613
01:06:00,342 --> 01:06:05,644
Dad, he pretends I'm still
baby-sitting for him.

614
01:06:05,713 --> 01:06:08,147
Why would you think that?

615
01:06:08,216 --> 01:06:10,184
Because he's paying me.

616
01:06:10,251 --> 01:06:13,117
To house-sit.

617
01:06:16,891 --> 01:06:19,450
Twenty dollars an hour?

618
01:06:19,526 --> 01:06:22,928
When did it go up?

619
01:06:22,997 --> 01:06:25,830
He wants to believe
that Lisa's still there.

620
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:28,959
I make it easier for him
to convince himself.

621
01:06:31,673 --> 01:06:36,109
Francis always had strange
ways to convince himself...

622
01:06:36,176 --> 01:06:39,112
of many things.

623
01:06:39,179 --> 01:06:44,948
Things that never happened,
things that might happen.

624
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:50,617
People who did things
for reasons, but they didn't.

625
01:06:52,694 --> 01:06:57,131
What has any of this
got to do with me, Dad?

626
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,636
Nothing.

627
01:07:03,704 --> 01:07:06,799
Nothing at all.

628
01:07:06,875 --> 01:07:10,810
So why do I have to keep going there?

629
01:07:10,878 --> 01:07:13,142
You don't.

630
01:07:13,213 --> 01:07:15,647
And you'll tell him?

631
01:07:20,521 --> 01:07:24,982
I was in here the other night
when that guy was thrown out.

632
01:07:25,059 --> 01:07:29,757
Why did that happen?
Has he ever been thrown out before?

633
01:07:29,829 --> 01:07:33,925
- Why do you think he would touch you?
- Why do you think he would touch you?

634
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,095
Why do you think he would touch you?

635
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:40,765
Well, what do you think was
going through his mind when he-

636
01:07:40,841 --> 01:07:44,436
Or-Or what was he thinking?

637
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:47,105
- Well-
- What's so funny?

638
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:49,115
Well, this is a joke, right?

639
01:07:49,183 --> 01:07:51,447
Not at all.

640
01:07:51,518 --> 01:07:56,250
If you do this favor for me,
I'll do that favor for you.

641
01:07:59,358 --> 01:08:02,020
But I'm not hiding anything.

642
01:08:02,096 --> 01:08:06,395
Thomas, you're hiding
a smuggling operation...

643
01:08:06,467 --> 01:08:11,461
that brings in over $200,000 a year,
probably a lot more.

644
01:08:11,538 --> 01:08:13,563
We've suspected you for a long time.

645
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:17,131
I was just brought in to
confirm what was already known.

646
01:08:17,211 --> 01:08:19,702
So how do you want me to report back?

647
01:08:23,549 --> 01:08:27,212
All I'm asking for is a bit of help.

648
01:08:27,287 --> 01:08:29,847
That's all.

649
01:08:29,923 --> 01:08:34,485
It's very important for me to know these
things. Just ask her these questions.

650
01:08:34,561 --> 01:08:38,827
Do this for me,
and you have a clean slate.

651
01:08:38,899 --> 01:08:44,701
This really hasn't been my day.

652
01:08:44,771 --> 01:08:49,208
So change things.
Make it your day.

653
01:08:51,345 --> 01:08:53,779
And all you men sitting
near that stage, I can see you.

654
01:08:53,847 --> 01:08:55,939
I know what you're thinking.

655
01:08:56,015 --> 01:08:59,280
You're thinking that "because I'm
sitting next to that stage...

656
01:08:59,352 --> 01:09:02,116
I'm getting the same feeling
as all those guys...

657
01:09:02,188 --> 01:09:06,125
shoveling out that cash for
their own private dancer."

658
01:09:06,193 --> 01:09:10,289
Well, you know, you guys want
to watch, go to the movies.

659
01:09:10,364 --> 01:09:13,127
We're in the live-action
business here, gents.

660
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:14,624
And, okay, granted...

661
01:09:14,625 --> 01:09:18,967
Granted, that beautiful creature
writhing before you on stage...

662
01:09:19,039 --> 01:09:22,132
she maybe, you know,
smiles at you.

663
01:09:22,208 --> 01:09:24,143
She winks her eyes at you
occasionally...

664
01:09:24,211 --> 01:09:26,475
and you may feel like the man.

665
01:09:26,547 --> 01:09:28,538
Is that all you guys are looking for?

666
01:09:28,615 --> 01:09:32,573
Is that all you want?
Come on, come on.

667
01:09:32,653 --> 01:09:36,588
Invite one of our lovely ladies over
to your table where the real action is.

668
01:09:36,656 --> 01:09:39,250
- Yeah!
- Hi.

669
01:09:39,326 --> 01:09:41,919
I'm really sorry that took so long,
or I took so long.

670
01:09:41,995 --> 01:09:44,087
- Hi.
- It's such a busy night.

671
01:09:44,164 --> 01:09:47,098
Hi. I'm Chrissy.

672
01:09:47,167 --> 01:09:49,930
Hi. I'm Thomas.

673
01:09:50,002 --> 01:09:54,439
It's nice to meet you, Thomas.
I like the name Thomas a lot.

674
01:09:54,507 --> 01:09:56,442
Oh, thanks.

675
01:09:56,510 --> 01:09:58,602
Are you from out of town?

676
01:09:58,678 --> 01:10:00,612
Yes.

677
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,944
Where are you from?

678
01:10:03,015 --> 01:10:07,111
Um... San Francisco.

679
01:10:07,187 --> 01:10:09,951
Oh, you're kidding.
I love San Francisco.

680
01:10:10,023 --> 01:10:12,616
Oh, you've- You've been there?

681
01:10:12,693 --> 01:10:17,959
Yeah, I was there a couple of
years ago with my debating team.

682
01:10:18,029 --> 01:10:20,123
- Debating team?
- Mm-hmm.

683
01:10:20,198 --> 01:10:23,965
Um, that's- I admire
someone who can debate well.

684
01:10:24,036 --> 01:10:27,129
I mean, who can debate
instead of just argue.

685
01:10:27,206 --> 01:10:31,643
Well, anyone can argue, but it's
a good skill, uh, discipline...

686
01:10:31,711 --> 01:10:34,475
to be able to debate and stand back.

687
01:10:34,547 --> 01:10:37,812
Um, and that's something you
can apply in your life...

688
01:10:37,884 --> 01:10:40,148
- outside of school.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

689
01:10:40,219 --> 01:10:43,153
And, and when you're meeting
someone or negotiating.

690
01:10:43,221 --> 01:10:44,080
Negotiating?

691
01:10:44,081 --> 01:10:47,658
Well, I mean, if you have...
If you have to...

692
01:10:47,726 --> 01:10:52,663
Um, it's a good skill to learn,
as opposed to cheerleading or-

693
01:10:52,731 --> 01:10:54,666
Well, that's what I say.

694
01:10:54,734 --> 01:10:57,168
Don't be nervous about this, Thomas.

695
01:10:57,235 --> 01:11:00,672
- We're gonna have some fun, okay?
- Sure.

696
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:03,334
Sure.

697
01:11:16,989 --> 01:11:20,515
Um... um...

698
01:11:20,592 --> 01:11:24,859
I was here the other night, um-

699
01:11:24,931 --> 01:11:26,865
What night was that?

700
01:11:26,932 --> 01:11:30,129
The night th-that guy was thrown out.

701
01:11:30,201 --> 01:11:32,466
You were dancing for him.

702
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:35,472
His name is Francis.

703
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:38,066
Um... what happened?

704
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:45,649
He was a bad boy.

705
01:11:45,717 --> 01:11:50,586
- Wh-What do you mean by that?
- What do I mean?

706
01:11:50,655 --> 01:11:53,682
I mean, have you danced
for him before a lot?

707
01:11:53,759 --> 01:11:55,692
Mm-hmm.

708
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,889
-And has he ever been thrown out before?
-No.

709
01:11:58,965 --> 01:12:01,125
So what do you think happened?

710
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:04,327
He touched me.

711
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:07,337
And when you're dancing
for the customer...

712
01:12:07,405 --> 01:12:10,169
they can't touch.

713
01:12:10,241 --> 01:12:13,075
Yes, but why do you think
he touched you last night?

714
01:12:13,144 --> 01:12:15,874
Has he ever touched you before?

715
01:12:15,947 --> 01:12:19,008
Is this what you really want to talk
about for five bucks a dance, Thomas?

716
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:23,283
Well, I just want to know what you
think was going on in his mind.

717
01:12:23,355 --> 01:12:26,722
Are you here for some kind
of psychology conference?

718
01:12:26,792 --> 01:12:30,625
Uh, well, uh, yes.

719
01:12:30,696 --> 01:12:33,460
Uh, I am, actually.

720
01:12:33,531 --> 01:12:36,467
He's, uh-

721
01:12:36,535 --> 01:12:39,799
He's a very particular case.

722
01:12:39,872 --> 01:12:43,136
Particular in what way?

723
01:12:45,877 --> 01:12:50,144
Um... you want the full story?

724
01:12:50,215 --> 01:12:54,516
Sure.

725
01:12:59,224 --> 01:13:02,192
His daughter was murdered
a couple of years ago...

726
01:13:02,259 --> 01:13:05,821
and then he was implicated.

727
01:13:05,896 --> 01:13:08,490
- For th-the murder?
- Yeah.

728
01:13:08,566 --> 01:13:10,860
- But why?
- I don't know.

729
01:13:10,861 --> 01:13:13,833
I don't really remember the details.

730
01:13:13,904 --> 01:13:16,998
I mean, he was cleared, and then
they caught the guy who did it.

731
01:13:17,075 --> 01:13:21,341
But... it obviously had, like, this...

732
01:13:21,412 --> 01:13:23,346
this incredible effect on him.

733
01:13:23,414 --> 01:13:26,680
I mean, he is-

734
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:30,777
He's just so fucked up about it.

735
01:13:30,854 --> 01:13:32,788
Oh.

736
01:13:35,026 --> 01:13:39,122
You know...

737
01:13:39,197 --> 01:13:42,132
Thomas...

738
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:46,864
Francis and I have a very
special type of relationship.

739
01:13:46,938 --> 01:13:50,134
And I've never- I've never minded.

740
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:53,643
But then he chose to violate it.

741
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:56,475
S-Special in what way?

742
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:06,987
Well, we've, we've always
had this understanding.

743
01:14:07,057 --> 01:14:10,152
I mean, I need him
for certain things...

744
01:14:10,228 --> 01:14:13,162
and... he needs me for certain things.

745
01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:15,664
I mean,
that's the way it's been.

746
01:14:15,732 --> 01:14:18,998
Uh, and how did he violate that?

747
01:14:19,069 --> 01:14:24,837
He-He violated that in his-his, in his
role and what he was supposed to do for me.

748
01:14:24,909 --> 01:14:27,400
Wh-What's he su- Why?

749
01:14:27,479 --> 01:14:30,710
What's he supposed to do for you? I
mean, he comes to this club. He pays you.

750
01:14:30,781 --> 01:14:34,615
Because I was doing things for him...

751
01:14:34,685 --> 01:14:37,678
and he's done things for me.

752
01:14:41,025 --> 01:14:44,289
What has he done for you?

753
01:14:44,362 --> 01:14:47,296
I'm-

754
01:14:47,364 --> 01:14:50,800
I'm sorry.

755
01:14:50,868 --> 01:14:55,931
Okay, this is really stupid.

756
01:14:56,007 --> 01:15:01,808
And then I'm getting so emotional
over the fact that he touched me...

757
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:06,145
because, I mean, he was,
he was always paying me...

758
01:15:06,217 --> 01:15:09,310
to do him this favor and-

759
01:15:09,386 --> 01:15:11,321
- What favor?
- I don't know, Thomas.

760
01:15:11,389 --> 01:15:15,325
- Why do you want to know all this?
- Well, I'm sorry, but I, uh-

761
01:15:15,393 --> 01:15:19,886
What is it about a schoolgirl that gives
her that special innocence, gentlemen?

762
01:15:19,963 --> 01:15:23,990
Such a thing that you have
absolutely no control over.

763
01:15:24,067 --> 01:15:27,662
You never have.

764
01:15:27,739 --> 01:15:31,835
And you never will.

765
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:34,041
After this break, we'll be
right back with sweet Chrissy...

766
01:15:34,042 --> 01:15:35,106
He's not supposed to do that.

767
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:37,114
- who'll help us answer that question.
- Do what?

768
01:15:37,181 --> 01:15:39,115
He's not supposed to-
He's not suppose-

769
01:15:39,183 --> 01:15:41,948
He can obviously see from his booth that
I'm sitting here talking with a client.

770
01:15:42,019 --> 01:15:44,784
He's not supposed to call me
when I'm talking with a client.

771
01:15:44,855 --> 01:15:48,790
Why? Do you have to go now?

772
01:15:50,193 --> 01:15:52,128
Uh, yeah.

773
01:15:52,196 --> 01:15:56,292
But I want to come back,
and I want to, you know, talk.

774
01:15:56,365 --> 01:16:00,302
But I want to move downstairs.
I don't like it here.

775
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:02,304
Sure, sure, sure.

776
01:16:02,372 --> 01:16:05,568
Okay. I'll see you soon.

777
01:16:12,382 --> 01:16:17,718
Uh, I'm going to move to the washroom.

778
01:16:45,681 --> 01:16:50,619
Hey, I've noticed you've been spending
a lot of time with that lady.

779
01:16:50,687 --> 01:16:53,121
Are you- Are you talking to me?

780
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:55,453
Yeah.

781
01:16:55,525 --> 01:16:59,859
You seem, uh, to, to both
hit it off together.

782
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:02,455
- Well, I guess.
- Yeah.

783
01:17:02,532 --> 01:17:04,692
Um, I guess that can happen.

784
01:17:04,767 --> 01:17:08,966
So what do you guys talk about?

785
01:17:09,038 --> 01:17:12,475
Oh, just things.

786
01:17:12,542 --> 01:17:16,307
What sort of things?

787
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:18,314
Oh, this and that.

788
01:17:18,382 --> 01:17:20,713
"This and that," eh?

789
01:17:20,784 --> 01:17:24,811
You know,
it's amazing how...

790
01:17:24,888 --> 01:17:29,415
you can hit it off with
someone like that, isn't it?

791
01:17:33,997 --> 01:17:38,093
Have you ever noticed that some
people just drift into your life...

792
01:17:38,168 --> 01:17:41,968
like you've known them forever?

793
01:17:42,038 --> 01:17:44,940
I mean, there are some people
that you can remember...

794
01:17:45,007 --> 01:17:49,775
the moment that you met them
really clearly.

795
01:17:49,845 --> 01:17:52,940
And other people that...

796
01:17:53,016 --> 01:17:58,784
it seems like you've known them forever,
even though you haven't.

797
01:17:58,854 --> 01:18:03,622
And they all become part of this
continuous memory you have of yourself.

798
01:18:03,693 --> 01:18:07,459
This ongoing-

799
01:18:07,530 --> 01:18:09,465
Are you with me?

800
01:18:09,533 --> 01:18:13,128
Uh, yeah, I think so.

801
01:18:13,202 --> 01:18:15,136
I mean, here you are,
y-you know...

802
01:18:15,205 --> 01:18:17,469
you're having this beautiful
conversation with her.

803
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:22,638
You're getting to know each other, and-

804
01:18:22,712 --> 01:18:26,978
I mean, there's other guys
that come in here.

805
01:18:27,049 --> 01:18:30,918
There's this one guy who comes in here
every other night or something...

806
01:18:30,987 --> 01:18:35,083
and he spends a few hours with her.

807
01:18:35,158 --> 01:18:37,591
But he never really
gets to know her, you know?

808
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:42,096
Not the way you have.
Not the way you two-

809
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:50,096
She really seems to be herself with you.

810
01:18:52,507 --> 01:18:55,442
Well, how do you know?

811
01:18:57,513 --> 01:19:00,276
What?
That she's being herself?

812
01:19:00,349 --> 01:19:03,442
Yeah.

813
01:19:03,518 --> 01:19:08,456
Because I used to be her lover.

814
01:19:08,524 --> 01:19:12,289
I'm, uh, sorry, sir.
I can't let you in.

815
01:19:12,361 --> 01:19:14,794
Look, why not?

816
01:19:16,364 --> 01:19:19,959
Look, can I... Can I at least
just talk to the manager?

817
01:19:20,035 --> 01:19:24,233
- You want to talk to the manager?
- Yeah.

818
01:19:24,305 --> 01:19:28,140
You have to understand that
we have very strict rules...

819
01:19:28,209 --> 01:19:30,735
regarding this sort of behavior here.

820
01:19:30,813 --> 01:19:34,408
- And I have always respected them.
- And this one time you didn't.

821
01:19:34,483 --> 01:19:37,246
Now, the problem, Mr. Brown,
is that this one time...

822
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:41,414
happened in a room full of
other men who were watching.

823
01:19:41,489 --> 01:19:43,754
Now, if I let you back into the club...

824
01:19:43,825 --> 01:19:46,951
what's to stop them from
trying to do the same thing?

825
01:19:46,952 --> 01:19:47,762
I told you.

826
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:50,923
Someone told me to do it.
I was set up.

827
01:19:50,999 --> 01:19:55,595
And you believed that someone?

828
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:59,766
This is, uh, Security.
- Please, sit down.

829
01:19:59,842 --> 01:20:01,775
Thank you.

830
01:20:04,013 --> 01:20:07,448
Why did you touch her?

831
01:20:07,516 --> 01:20:11,246
- Well, I needed to make sure.
- Why?

832
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:14,345
What if she let you?
What would you have done?

833
01:20:14,422 --> 01:20:16,948
I'd have been disappointed.

834
01:20:18,526 --> 01:20:22,462
I'm not sure...
I understand you.

835
01:20:22,531 --> 01:20:25,898
That's not the way she was raised.

836
01:20:25,968 --> 01:20:28,527
You know her?
Personally?

837
01:20:30,538 --> 01:20:34,304
There is another club I can recommend.

838
01:20:34,375 --> 01:20:36,468
I need to come here.

839
01:20:36,544 --> 01:20:41,106
- I understand that very well.
- No, I don't think you understand.

840
01:20:41,182 --> 01:20:44,812
Exotica is a special place.

841
01:20:44,887 --> 01:20:49,483
My mother was dedicated to creating a
very particular type of atmosphere...

842
01:20:49,557 --> 01:20:52,720
and I would like to maintain that.

843
01:20:52,794 --> 01:20:56,423
You don't understand.

844
01:20:59,235 --> 01:21:04,468
Mr. Brown, we're all aware
of what you've gone through.

845
01:21:04,539 --> 01:21:07,337
You've suffered a lot.

846
01:21:07,409 --> 01:21:12,506
But you have to understand that
Exotica is here for your amusement.

847
01:21:12,581 --> 01:21:16,108
We're here to entertain,
not to heal.

848
01:21:16,185 --> 01:21:19,517
There are other places for that.

849
01:21:22,422 --> 01:21:24,357
Other places?

850
01:21:24,425 --> 01:21:28,521
I can give you a list.

851
01:21:28,595 --> 01:21:30,620
Mr. Brown?

852
01:21:30,697 --> 01:21:32,756
Are you listening to me,
Mr. Brown?

853
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:49,145
Um...

854
01:21:49,217 --> 01:21:54,655
um, I just met this man in the washroom.

855
01:21:54,722 --> 01:21:56,656
What man?

856
01:21:56,724 --> 01:21:58,658
Well, I'm not sure.
I was in a booth.

857
01:21:58,726 --> 01:22:01,159
I didn't really have
a chance to see him.

858
01:22:01,228 --> 01:22:05,324
- So how did you meet him?
- He just started talking to me.

859
01:22:05,399 --> 01:22:07,493
And what did he say?

860
01:22:07,569 --> 01:22:12,505
Well, um, he said
he used to be your lover.

861
01:22:12,573 --> 01:22:15,804
Well, it's always
a sad moment, gentlemen...

862
01:22:15,877 --> 01:22:20,836
when that clock
strikes that magic hour...

863
01:22:20,915 --> 01:22:26,512
and we have to send you out into
the long and dark and lonely night.

864
01:22:28,590 --> 01:22:31,957
But just remember...

865
01:22:32,025 --> 01:22:36,463
we're only ever just a dream away...

866
01:22:36,531 --> 01:22:39,294
wherever that is.

867
01:22:57,384 --> 01:23:00,320
- I guess-
- I have to go.

868
01:23:01,889 --> 01:23:04,322
Oh, okay.

869
01:23:04,391 --> 01:23:06,986
Um, wait a minute.

870
01:23:07,061 --> 01:23:11,657
- Oh, no. Thomas, don't.
- No, no, no.

871
01:23:11,733 --> 01:23:16,499
- Thomas, please, don't.
- Uh... no, no. Uh, I insist.

872
01:23:16,571 --> 01:23:18,663
Please.

873
01:23:20,073 --> 01:23:22,167
Thank you.

874
01:23:30,717 --> 01:23:33,277
Your dad told me about, um...

875
01:23:33,353 --> 01:23:36,948
you not wanting to baby-sit anymore.

876
01:23:37,024 --> 01:23:40,791
There's no baby to sit.

877
01:23:43,531 --> 01:23:47,296
Well, I just want you
to know, I understand.

878
01:23:47,368 --> 01:23:50,803
Understand what?

879
01:23:50,871 --> 01:23:55,240
That this might all seem a little weird.

880
01:23:55,309 --> 01:23:58,641
A little?

881
01:24:00,047 --> 01:24:05,213
- I just want to thank you, Tracey.
- For what?

882
01:24:09,723 --> 01:24:12,817
You've been very patient.

883
01:24:12,892 --> 01:24:16,329
And, uh...

884
01:24:16,396 --> 01:24:20,832
if you think the time has come for
this to end, then I understand.

885
01:24:28,074 --> 01:24:31,442
Thank you.

886
01:24:31,511 --> 01:24:33,945
Good night, Francis.

887
01:24:54,568 --> 01:24:57,628
He-He-He calls me from a table to dance.
Of course I expect you to do something.

888
01:24:57,704 --> 01:24:58,613
Christina...

889
01:24:58,614 --> 01:25:00,639
And then- and then he follows this guy
to the washroom...

890
01:25:00,706 --> 01:25:02,929
and he tells this guy
that, that he was my lover.

891
01:25:02,930 --> 01:25:03,641
Well, he was.

892
01:25:03,709 --> 01:25:06,474
It's going too far, Zoe.

893
01:25:06,545 --> 01:25:11,483
Actually, baby, you have
no idea how far it's gone.

894
01:25:11,551 --> 01:25:14,145
You know,
I told him to touch you.

895
01:25:14,221 --> 01:25:18,021
I said you were into it.
Yeah.

896
01:25:18,091 --> 01:25:21,517
It used to be wonderful
watching you dance for him,

897
01:25:21,518 --> 01:25:23,494
seeing how you could soothe him.

898
01:25:24,898 --> 01:25:27,832
I mean, it soothed me.

899
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:31,098
You know, you soothed me.

900
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:33,161
Do you understand that?

901
01:25:36,510 --> 01:25:38,773
- Hey, hey.
- Don't, don't, don't!

902
01:25:38,844 --> 01:25:42,781
- Stop. Stop that!
- Don't fucking touch me, you fucker!

903
01:25:42,849 --> 01:25:45,443
- Stop!
- Just fuck off, Zoe!

904
01:25:45,519 --> 01:25:49,113
- Stop it when I say! Eric!
- Stop it! Ow!

905
01:25:49,188 --> 01:25:51,122
Chill out! Chill out!

906
01:25:51,190 --> 01:25:53,784
Chill out! Relax!

907
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:56,454
- All right? Relax!
- Eric, come here!

908
01:25:56,530 --> 01:26:01,296
- John! Get out. What's the matter?
- No!

909
01:26:01,368 --> 01:26:04,632
Fuck off, Zoe! No!

910
01:26:29,062 --> 01:26:31,996
Morning, Thomas.

911
01:26:32,064 --> 01:26:35,591
- What happened?
- I had to leave.

912
01:26:35,668 --> 01:26:38,228
Did you, uh,
hear everything?

913
01:26:38,304 --> 01:26:41,273
Yeah.

914
01:26:41,341 --> 01:26:43,935
Did you know?

915
01:26:44,010 --> 01:26:46,102
Did I know what?

916
01:26:46,178 --> 01:26:50,114
That she knew...
about your daughter.

917
01:27:01,025 --> 01:27:05,463
You know, when the,
when the police came to question me...

918
01:27:05,531 --> 01:27:09,297
they told me a lot of things.

919
01:27:09,368 --> 01:27:13,804
They told me that my wife was
having an affair with my brother;

920
01:27:13,872 --> 01:27:16,808
had been for years.

921
01:27:16,876 --> 01:27:21,209
They told me that I thought
Lisa wasn't my daughter.

922
01:27:22,881 --> 01:27:26,147
They told me I thought she was Harold's.

923
01:27:26,217 --> 01:27:28,276
Wh-Why would they say that?

924
01:27:28,353 --> 01:27:32,916
Because they thought I could harm her...

925
01:27:32,992 --> 01:27:37,759
that I would harm her.

926
01:27:37,830 --> 01:27:43,598
And then they found the man
that, uh, that did it.

927
01:27:43,668 --> 01:27:47,435
Let me go.

928
01:27:47,505 --> 01:27:51,601
And I went home.

929
01:27:54,346 --> 01:27:58,611
And then my wife was killed in a
car accident a couple months later.

930
01:27:58,684 --> 01:28:03,451
And, uh,
Harold was in the car.

931
01:28:05,189 --> 01:28:08,250
He lived.

932
01:28:29,314 --> 01:28:31,407
What do you think it would have taken...

933
01:28:31,483 --> 01:28:34,918
for your father to kill someone?

934
01:28:34,986 --> 01:28:39,753
I'm asking because there's
someone that I want to kill now.

935
01:28:39,824 --> 01:28:45,263
I felt it last night as I
listened to him in the washroom.

936
01:28:45,330 --> 01:28:47,424
I don't understand.

937
01:28:47,499 --> 01:28:51,435
He set me up...
to touch her.

938
01:28:51,503 --> 01:28:53,596
Why would he do that?

939
01:28:53,672 --> 01:28:58,268
He took something very special from me.

940
01:28:58,343 --> 01:29:02,439
I've had too many
special things taken away.

941
01:29:02,513 --> 01:29:07,451
- That's why we have to go back tonight.
- To kill him?

942
01:29:07,519 --> 01:29:09,809
What would you do, Thomas?
What would you do?

943
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:10,612
Well-

944
01:29:10,688 --> 01:29:13,954
- Well, I would talk to him.
- I can't even get in there.

945
01:29:14,025 --> 01:29:16,961
What would you do?

946
01:29:17,029 --> 01:29:20,465
You go back tonight...

947
01:29:20,532 --> 01:29:23,126
and you have her dance for you...

948
01:29:23,202 --> 01:29:26,069
and then you touch her.

949
01:29:26,138 --> 01:29:28,800
And he'll throw you out
just like he threw me out.

950
01:29:28,874 --> 01:29:31,398
But I'll be waiting outside
with the gun.

951
01:29:31,476 --> 01:29:34,503
I'm not gonna help you kill somebody.

952
01:29:34,580 --> 01:29:37,845
Not even to save a few years in prison?

953
01:29:37,916 --> 01:29:40,146
No.

954
01:29:42,653 --> 01:29:44,916
Well, to help me then?

955
01:29:50,161 --> 01:29:53,596
And that was Mirella,
gentlemen. Mirella.

956
01:29:53,663 --> 01:29:57,099
You can have her at your own
table for only five dollars.

957
01:29:57,168 --> 01:29:59,431
Thank you, Mirella.

958
01:30:01,672 --> 01:30:06,768
And now, it's always a pleasure to
announce to you our next dancer.

959
01:30:06,844 --> 01:30:10,940
Gentlemen, please, let's give
a big round of applause...

960
01:30:11,014 --> 01:30:16,214
for Christina.

961
01:33:44,026 --> 01:33:47,622
Don't be afraid.

962
01:33:47,696 --> 01:33:50,222
I know everything about you.

963
01:33:50,299 --> 01:33:54,236
What do you know about me?

964
01:33:56,539 --> 01:34:00,269
I found her.

965
01:34:00,343 --> 01:34:04,278
You found who?

966
01:34:09,551 --> 01:34:12,145
Your little girl.

967
01:34:13,390 --> 01:34:16,325
Oh. Oh.

968
01:34:39,348 --> 01:34:41,544
I found her, man.

969
01:34:45,522 --> 01:34:47,455
I found her.

970
01:35:50,018 --> 01:35:53,954
Yeah, play something happy.
Play something happy.

971
01:35:54,021 --> 01:35:55,989
Yeah. Hello.

972
01:35:58,527 --> 01:36:00,960
Okay, I'll get it,
I'll get it, I'll get it.

973
01:36:07,702 --> 01:36:10,137
- Hi, Christina.
- Hi.

974
01:36:10,204 --> 01:36:15,472
- I'm a little bit early.
- Yeah, th-that's okay. Come on in.

975
01:36:20,449 --> 01:36:22,974
Yeah, I mean,
it's difficult for me to tell...

976
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:25,815
'cause I never had much of a
musical education myself...

977
01:36:25,887 --> 01:36:28,981
but her teacher thinks
she's really talented.

978
01:36:29,056 --> 01:36:33,083
And, um, actually, we were thinking
of buying her a better piano.

979
01:36:33,161 --> 01:36:36,097
An exotic baby grand,
you know?

980
01:36:36,164 --> 01:36:38,429
And when I mentioned "baby grand,"
do you know what she said to me?

981
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:42,936
She said, "Dad,
isn't that a contradiction in terms?"

982
01:36:43,005 --> 01:36:45,768
I mean, she just never
ceases to amaze me.

983
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,775
I mean, she's eight years old.
Can you imagine?

984
01:36:47,842 --> 01:36:50,539
She can already identify-
Wh-What do you call that when...

985
01:36:50,612 --> 01:36:53,945
it's two words,
kind of cancel each other out?

986
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:58,282
Oh, she just amazes me.

987
01:37:00,355 --> 01:37:05,121
Where's your mind?

988
01:37:05,193 --> 01:37:08,630
I was just thinking.

989
01:37:08,697 --> 01:37:11,962
About what?

990
01:37:12,034 --> 01:37:16,130
About the way you talk about Lisa.

991
01:37:16,204 --> 01:37:18,798
You get so excited.

992
01:37:18,873 --> 01:37:22,809
It's nice.

993
01:37:24,213 --> 01:37:27,943
Well, I'm sure your parents
talk about you that way too.

994
01:37:28,016 --> 01:37:31,076
I don't think so.

995
01:37:31,152 --> 01:37:34,918
Oh, I do.

996
01:37:34,989 --> 01:37:37,083
Why?

997
01:37:37,159 --> 01:37:41,425
Because you're a very
responsible young woman.

998
01:37:41,496 --> 01:37:45,934
Responsible to what?

999
01:37:46,001 --> 01:37:50,768
Well, to whatever it is
you believe you have to do.

1000
01:37:50,838 --> 01:37:54,934
Like what?

1001
01:37:55,009 --> 01:38:00,846
Well, Lisa loves it when you come
over to baby-sit, for example.

1002
01:38:03,018 --> 01:38:06,783
She says you really listen to her.

1003
01:38:06,854 --> 01:38:09,788
That's nice.

1004
01:38:09,857 --> 01:38:12,553
She really listens to me too.

1005
01:38:18,533 --> 01:38:21,593
She thinks you're not very happy.

1006
01:38:21,669 --> 01:38:27,129
Listen, Christina,

1007
01:38:27,207 --> 01:38:31,406
if there's, if there's ever
anything you want to talk about...

1008
01:38:31,479 --> 01:38:35,006
about what might be going on
at home or whatever...

1009
01:38:35,082 --> 01:38:39,917
you know that I'm here, okay?

1010
01:38:41,821 --> 01:38:44,415
- Okay.
- Okay?

1011
01:38:44,491 --> 01:38:46,584
Okay.

1012
01:38:51,832 --> 01:38:55,426
Okay.

1013
01:39:00,674 --> 01:39:03,906
Oh, no.
It's okay.

1014
01:39:07,013 --> 01:39:09,107
Thank you.

1015
01:39:16,524 --> 01:39:20,051
You know, I really enjoy
these drives home, Mr. Brown.

1016
01:39:20,127 --> 01:39:23,618
Good, good.
So do I.

1017
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:29,567
- Bye, Mr. Brown.
- Good-bye.
