1
00:02:07,056 --> 00:02:09,320
你得说服自己
You have to ask yourself...

2
00:02:09,392 --> 00:02:12,987
这人肯定有夹带
what brought the person
to this point.

3
00:02:13,062 --> 00:02:18,557
看他的表情
他的举止 他的途径
What was seen in his face,
his manner, that channeled him here.

4
00:02:18,634 --> 00:02:21,694
你得确信自己
You have
to convince yourself...

5
00:02:21,771 --> 00:02:27,038
能搜出他所藏的东西
that this person has something hidden
that you have to find.

6
00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:32,206
你检查他的行李袋
但他的表情
You check his bags,
but it's his face...

7
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:36,047
他的姿势
才是你应该真正注意的
his gestures that
you're really watching.

8
00:02:38,988 --> 00:02:41,013
谢谢你
Thank you.

9
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,475
他瞪着你看
He's staring straight at you.

10
00:03:01,544 --> 00:03:04,308
仔细看他
Look at him, carefully.

11
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,678
你看到什么?
What do you see?

12
00:03:06,749 --> 00:03:11,049
第4保安部17号行李认领处

13
00:03:22,264 --> 00:03:25,165
你去哪里?
市中心
Where you headed?
Uh, downtown.

14
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,665
要分摊车资吗?
好呀
You want to split it?
S-Sure.

15
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,787
什么?今晚不行，你确定?
What? Not tonight.
Are you sure?

16
00:03:47,857 --> 00:03:50,155
不能取消吗?
Well, can't you cancel?

17
00:04:02,271 --> 00:04:07,038
这是什么?
Oh. Uh... what are these?

18
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:09,771
今晚的芭蕾舞票
Ballet tickets for tonight.

你不喜欢芭蕾?
只喜欢某芭蕾
You don't like ballet?
Well, some ballets.

21
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,450
那就是某些芭蕾
Well, that's exactly
what this is: some ballet.

22
00:04:20,523 --> 00:04:23,458
你也可以在门口把它卖掉
Look, you can always scalp
the tickets at the door.

23
00:04:23,526 --> 00:04:26,654
你的意思是
作为交换...
Oh, you mean, uh,
take these in exchange...

24
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:30,790
要用它抵车资
你认为呢?
for you paying your part of the fare.
Well, what do you think?

25
00:04:51,854 --> 00:04:54,118
再见 约翰
晚安 约翰
See ya, John.
Good night, John.

他们都在找你
People are asking for you.

29
00:05:48,177 --> 00:05:51,112
她来了 我找到她了
She's right over there. I'll get her.

30
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,205
再见
Bye.

31
00:05:57,853 --> 00:06:02,313

Yeah!

32
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:04,621
各位，用力鼓掌吧
Let's bring those big, hairy
palms together, gentlemen...

33
00:06:04,693 --> 00:06:06,888
热烈鼓掌
and have a nice,
big round of applause...

34
00:06:06,962 --> 00:06:09,294
欢迎卡莉

35
00:06:09,365 --> 00:06:11,299
卡莉
Kali.

36
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:13,301
没错，卡莉
Yes, indeed. Kali.

37
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:16,133
让卡莉陪你坐台
And you, too, can you, too,
can have Kali come over to your table...

38
00:06:16,205 --> 00:06:19,971
花五块就可以
她会引你进入她的神秘世界
for only five dollars, where she can
show you the mysteries of her world.

39
00:06:20,042 --> 00:06:24,706
相信我，男士们
Trust me, gentlemen. Trust me.

40
00:07:11,427 --> 00:07:13,952
噢！宝贝，宝贝，宝贝
Oh! Baby, baby, baby!

41
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:19,126
噢！宝贝，为我表演
Ooh! Do it for me, baby!

42
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:24,969
老天，真不可思议
Oh! My God, that's incredible.
That's incredible.

43
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,474
让我问你们件事，男士们
Let me ask you something,
gentlemen.

44
00:07:27,543 --> 00:07:31,639
是什么使女学生天真无邪?
What is it that gives a schoolgirl
her special innocence?

45
00:07:31,714 --> 00:07:37,482
她的香味?鲜花?轻柔春雨?
Her sweet fragrance? Fresh flowers...
light as a spring rain?

46
00:07:37,553 --> 00:07:39,987
我的天
Oh, my God.
My God.

47
00:07:40,055 --> 00:07:42,649
还是她需要爱抚的结实细嫩肌肤...
Or is it her firm, young flesh
inviting your every caress...

48
00:07:42,725 --> 00:07:45,159
引诱你探索...
enticing you to explore...

49
00:07:45,227 --> 00:07:50,460
她最深处的秘密?
her deepest
and most private secrets?

50
00:07:50,532 --> 00:07:55,595
这点我要你们自己决定
Well, gentlemen, I'm gonna let you
decide that one for yourselves.

51
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:58,936
让我们一起欢迎漂亮的
Please join me
in welcoming a sassy...

52
00:07:59,008 --> 00:08:02,944
性感宝贝
bit of jailbait
to our stage.

53
00:08:03,012 --> 00:08:07,449
对
Yes, indeed.

54
00:08:07,516 --> 00:08:10,280
出来，可爱的克莉丝
Come out, sweet Chrissy.

55
00:08:10,352 --> 00:08:12,946
不管你在那，出来吧
Wherever you are, baby,
come on out.

56
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:34,132
你以为你很坏?
You think you're bad, eh, baby?

57
00:09:35,703 --> 00:09:37,502
你是很坏
You're bad.

58
00:09:53,255 --> 00:09:57,658
我要票
That will be $5.50.

59
00:10:03,263 --> 00:10:06,330
谢谢
Thank you.

60
00:11:34,423 --> 00:11:37,915
艾瑞克?
什么事?
Eric?
What?

61
00:11:37,993 --> 00:11:42,362
琳达跳完舞了
Linda finished her dance.

62
00:11:42,431 --> 00:11:46,197
快用你的大手鼓掌 男士们
Let's bring those big, hairy
palms together, gentlemen.

63
00:11:46,268 --> 00:11:50,364
放纵吧 男士们
Give it up. Yeah, gentlemen. Yes.

64
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:55,775
咱们为琳达鼓掌
Have a nice, big round
of applause for Linda. Yeah.

65
00:11:55,844 --> 00:11:58,745
好呀，琳达
Yes, indeed, Linda.

66
00:11:58,814 --> 00:12:01,044
我想提醒的是
没有比琳达更喜欢做的事情了...
And just a reminder that there is
nothing Linda would love more...

67
00:12:01,116 --> 00:12:03,482
那就是偷溜过去陪你坐台
than to slink over
to your table and...

68
00:12:03,552 --> 00:12:07,818
花五块，就会有私密秀
give you your own private show
for only five dollars.

69
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,824
没错
That's right.

70
00:12:09,892 --> 00:12:13,953
五块就能得美丽的狐狸精
Five dollars is all it takes
to have one of our beautiful foxes...

71
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:17,328
她会陪你坐台
使你兴奋不巳
come over to your table
and get you all hot and bothered.

72
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,163
为何要烦恼
But, hey, why be bothered...

73
00:12:20,235 --> 00:12:24,501
何不来点帝王享受
when you're being treated
like a king?

74
00:12:24,573 --> 00:12:29,169
累了一天
You've had a rough day.

75
00:12:29,244 --> 00:12:32,475
难道你不该...
Don't you think you owe it
to yourselves to...

76
00:12:32,548 --> 00:12:36,382
做点特别的事?
do something that'll make you feel
like you're someone special?

77
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:42,787
你很特别
You are someone special.

78
00:12:42,858 --> 00:12:47,318
只要五块钱，便可证明
Five dollars is all
it takes to prove it.

79
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,937
大家为蜜雪儿鼓掌吧
Yes, let's have a nice big round
of applause for Michelle.

80
00:13:32,007 --> 00:13:35,170
天,真美
My God, that was beautiful.

81
00:13:37,212 --> 00:13:39,703
宝贝，出来
Ooh, baby, you come out.

82
00:13:39,781 --> 00:13:43,217
我想提醒的是
没有比蜜雪儿更喜欢做的事情了...
And just to remind you that, uh, there's
nothing Michelle would love more...

83
00:13:43,285 --> 00:13:45,549
那就是偷溜过去陪你坐台
为你一人跳舞
than to come over to your table
and give you your own private dance.

84
00:13:47,956 --> 00:13:50,948
各位好
Hello, gentlemen!

85
00:13:51,026 --> 00:13:52,960
外面有人吗?有人活着吗?
Anybody out there?
Anybody alive?

86
00:13:53,028 --> 00:13:55,826
无论是哪一位，只要花五块，
你就能得到卡莉
Anybody, for five dollars,
you can have Kali.

87
00:13:55,897 --> 00:14:00,027
便可让卡莉陪坐台
Kali at your own private table.

88
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,974
请问，男士们
Let me ask you something,
gentlemen.

89
00:14:07,042 --> 00:14:09,272
女学生为何...
What is it
about a schoolgirl...

90
00:14:09,344 --> 00:14:12,802
天真无邪?
that gives her that
special innocence?

91
00:14:16,385 --> 00:14:19,013
是她们凝视你的方式?
Is it the way that
they can gaze at you...

92
00:14:19,087 --> 00:14:23,148
她渴望你说些话
waiting for you to say something
with so much expectation and hope...

93
00:14:23,225 --> 00:14:27,821
她希望使你陶醉
that you're just...
you're just paralyzed into...

94
00:14:29,531 --> 00:14:32,898
而沉默
into silence?

95
00:15:22,784 --> 00:15:27,278
我要把这还给你
为什么?
Look, uh, I want to give this back to you.
Why?

96
00:15:27,356 --> 00:15:30,120
这些票是别人给我的
Well, you see,
those tickets were given to me...

97
00:15:30,192 --> 00:15:34,959
卖掉它们会我很不自在
and, uh, I just feel uncomfortable
about having sold them.

98
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,999
不要紧
不，真的
That's okay.
No, no, no, really, I-

99
00:15:42,404 --> 00:15:45,339
我们尚未自我介绍 我是汤玛士
We never really introduced ourselves.
I'm Thomas.

100
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,341
大卫
David.

101
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:49,775
我能用这请你喝一杯?
Can I use this
to take you out for a drink?

102
00:15:49,845 --> 00:15:54,714
你太客气了
但…但什么?
Oh, that's, uh, very kind
of you, but, uh. But what?

103
00:15:54,783 --> 00:15:58,617
但我真的得回家了
But I really have
to get home.

104
00:16:39,394 --> 00:16:41,589
谢了
Thanks.

105
00:16:41,663 --> 00:16:43,597
你下周四有空吗?
Are you available
next Thursday?

106
00:16:43,665 --> 00:16:45,656
我想有吧
好
Uh, I think so, yeah.
Good, good.

107
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:50,435
崔西
怎样?
Tracey?
Yeah?

108
00:16:50,505 --> 00:16:52,769
我没那么令人烦吧?
I'm not that boring, am I?

109
00:16:52,841 --> 00:16:56,777
什么意思
耳机
What do you mean?
Well, the earphones.

110
00:16:56,845 --> 00:16:59,541
我们曾听收音机
I mean, we used to listen
to the radio...

111
00:16:59,614 --> 00:17:03,573
你常问问题
and you used to ask me
all sorts of questions.

112
00:17:03,652 --> 00:17:06,348
你要我问更多问题?
So you want me
to ask more questions?

113
00:17:08,023 --> 00:17:11,720
当然，如果你想知道什么
Sure. Yeah, I mean, if there's
something y-you want to know.

114
00:17:13,028 --> 00:17:15,292
好，我会想想看
Okay. I'll see
what I can think up.

115
00:17:15,363 --> 00:17:17,388
向你爹问好
我会的
Say hi to your dad.
I will.

116
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:19,400
晚安
晚安
Good night.
Good night.

117
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:43,756
有人说什么吗?
没
Did someone say something?
No.

118
00:17:43,825 --> 00:17:46,020
所以怎样?
So, what's the point?

119
00:17:46,094 --> 00:17:49,427
我注意到你的态度改变
I've just noticed
a change in your attitude.

120
00:17:53,502 --> 00:17:57,063
你若不介绍克莉汀娜也行
Look, I would understand if you would
prefer not to introduce Christina.

121
00:17:57,138 --> 00:18:01,575
我可以自己来
I could do it myself.

122
00:18:01,643 --> 00:18:03,975
我想
Actually, I've been thinking
that, perhaps...

123
00:18:04,045 --> 00:18:08,379
我该多参与介绍才对
I should be getting more involved
in the introductions overall.

124
00:18:10,452 --> 00:18:13,683
还能像我妈般有自己麦克风
I could have my own microphone,
like my mother used to do.

125
00:18:13,755 --> 00:18:17,054
不，我很喜欢介绍克莉汀娜
No, I mean, I actually
enjoy introducing Christina.

126
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,753
那对我很有治疗效果
I mean, I find it
very therapeutic, you know?

127
00:18:19,828 --> 00:18:23,889
我不是为此而付钱给你
That's not what you're getting paid for.
Well, it seems to me...

128
00:18:23,965 --> 00:18:28,197
我拿钱是使每位小姐与众不同
that I'm being paid to make every girl
seem like she's something special, right?

129
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:33,469
所以我得充分运用想像力
So, in order to do that,
I have to let my imagination run wild.

130
00:18:35,544 --> 00:18:39,105
提到克莉汀娜
So, I mean, when it comes
to Christina, I, you know-

131
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,876
我会特别疯狂
My imagination is bound
to run a little wilder.

132
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,680
我无法克制，佐儿
There's nothing that I can do
to control that, Zoe.

133
00:18:44,753 --> 00:18:47,415
那使客人们很不自在
Makes the clients uncomfortable.

134
00:18:47,489 --> 00:18:50,185
你认为你的状况能使人自在?
And you think your state
puts them at ease?

135
00:18:59,935 --> 00:19:01,869
嘿
Hey.

136
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:05,768
他在踢吗?
Is he kicking?

137
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,277
直如此
All the time.

138
00:19:13,481 --> 00:19:15,676
你想摸吗?
Do you feel like touching it?

139
00:19:27,596 --> 00:19:29,530
哦
Oh.

140
00:19:36,705 --> 00:19:41,039
你觉得如何?
How are you feeling about this?

141
00:19:41,109 --> 00:19:44,636
很好
很好？
Fine.
Fine?

142
00:19:44,713 --> 00:19:47,341
你快乐吗?
Are you happy?

143
00:19:47,415 --> 00:19:49,542
我为你而快乐
For you.

144
00:19:52,454 --> 00:19:55,651
你呢，艾瑞克?
What about you, Eric?
What about you?

145
00:19:57,592 --> 00:20:00,117
我得谨慎处理感情，对吧?
Well, I guess I got to be pretty careful
about my feelings, right?

146
00:20:00,195 --> 00:20:03,528
我的意思是...
I mean, uh...

147
00:20:03,598 --> 00:20:07,659
所以我们才会签合约对吧?
that's why we have
a contract, isn't it?

148
00:20:13,174 --> 00:20:15,768
公寓里到处是灰尘
There's plaster dust
all over the apartment.

149
00:20:15,844 --> 00:20:19,678
不，我没有夸大
昨夜睡觉时都在咳嗽
No, I'm not exaggerating. No, I was
coughing in my sleep last night.

150
00:20:19,748 --> 00:20:22,842
你说我住这儿会很舒服
You told me that it was going to be
comfortable for me to live there...

151
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:25,010
结果根本不舒服
and it is not comfortable.

152
00:20:25,086 --> 00:20:27,020
家俱上都是灰
There's plastic on the furniture.

153
00:20:27,088 --> 00:20:30,182
真差劲
That is not comfortable living.

154
00:20:30,258 --> 00:20:33,318
 噢 过来看看
Yeah. Oh, come on, look.

155
00:20:33,395 --> 00:20:37,559
你说要拆壁纸，不是拆掉墙壁
You told me you were going to strip
the wallpaper, not strip the walls down.

156
00:20:37,632 --> 00:20:40,567
喂，你怎么不早说
Well, no, if you'd,
if you'd told me in the first place-

157
00:20:40,635 --> 00:20:43,126
如果你早说清楚该怎么做
我会考虑
If you'd told me what kind of job
it was, then I would have considered it.

158
00:20:43,204 --> 00:20:47,538
即使是那样，我觉得
你好像犯了错
Although, it's it makes me seem
like you've maybe made a mistake.

159
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:50,703
那使我感到怀疑
That's what it makes me suspect.

160
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,713
不，太迟了，没办法了
What? No, it's too late now.
It's inaccessible.

161
00:20:55,784 --> 00:20:58,753
我不会付钱给你。干嘛付钱给你？
你事情没做好呀
I'm not gonna pay you. Pay you for what?
You didn't do the job.

162
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:03,018
你做的不是我要你做的事
Well, you did a job, but it's not
the job that I asked you to do.

163
00:21:03,091 --> 00:21:05,855
不是我们讲好的事
It's not the job
we agreed on.

164
00:21:05,927 --> 00:21:09,158
我可以对任何人做这事
Well, I can get anyone,
any number of people to do this.

165
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:13,223
对，我无所谓
Yeah, that's just fine with me.

166
00:21:16,805 --> 00:21:20,002
我能效劳吗?
Yeah, can I help you?

167
00:21:21,443 --> 00:21:23,536
品托先生?
是的
Mr. Pinto?
Uh, yes.

168
00:21:23,611 --> 00:21:27,244
我是佛西布朗
我们数周前电话连络过
I'm Francis Brown. We spoke, uh,
on the phone a couple of weeks ago.
170
00:21:43,483 --> 00:21:48,011lianl
加拿大国税局
是的，当然
Revenue Canada.
Oh, uh, of course. Uh-

169
00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:37,149
你旅程如何?
很好
How was your trip?
Oh, it was fine.

170
00:21:37,225 --> 00:21:40,558
你何时回来的?
昨天刚到
And when did you get back?
Um, just yesterday.

171
00:21:40,628 --> 00:21:43,563
天气好吗?
Good weather?

172
00:21:43,631 --> 00:21:47,192
是的，好极了
Yes, yes, lovely. Yeah.

173
00:21:47,268 --> 00:21:50,101
现在有空吗?品托先生?
当然
Is this a good time, Mr. Pinto?
Oh, sure.

174
00:21:50,171 --> 00:21:54,665
但你似乎有点
有点什么?
It's just that you seem a
little, uh，A little what?

175
00:21:54,743 --> 00:21:57,337
心不在焉
不，不
Flustered.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

176
00:21:57,412 --> 00:22:00,176
我很好
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

177
00:22:00,248 --> 00:22:02,182
对
Good.

178
00:22:07,856 --> 00:22:11,690
对，我现在不能谈。待会儿
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen,
I can't talk to you right now. L-Later.

179
00:22:23,938 --> 00:22:26,338
好，嗯
Okay, uh-

180
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,592
这儿可找到所有银行借贷表?
So this is where I'd find
all the bank s-statements? Uh-

181
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:49,926
对，好的，还有那些
Yeah, that's right,
and those there.

182
00:22:53,368 --> 00:22:56,633
好，我有问题会再问你
Okay. Well, if I have any questions,
I'll let you know.

183
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,733
是否有点热?
是的
Is it a little hot for you back here?
It's, uh, yeah.

184
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:05,041
你可开小点
You could turn it down a tad.

185
00:23:05,113 --> 00:23:10,642
我想动物的温度要小心控制
I suppose you have to be pretty careful
with the temperature with the animals.

186
00:23:10,718 --> 00:23:13,312
它们比你想像中更强壮
Oh, well, they're a lot hardier
than you'd think.

187
00:23:16,057 --> 00:23:18,992
我不会认为它很虚弱
I wouldn't think
they're not hardy.

188
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:24,828
来自异地不表示它们没有耐力
I mean, just because they're exotic
doesn't mean they can't endure extremes.

189
00:23:24,899 --> 00:23:28,995
反正这世界就像丛林对吗?
It is, after all,
a jungle out there, isn't it?

190
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,905
这要多久时间?
Um, so, how long
will this take?

191
00:23:35,977 --> 00:23:39,140
审计?
是的
An audit?
Yes.

192
00:23:39,214 --> 00:23:42,377
看你准备得如何而定
Well, it depends on
how prepared you are.

193
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:47,444
你有会计师吗?
没有，真的
Have you got an accountant? Uh,
well, um, no. Well, no, not really, no.

194
00:23:47,522 --> 00:23:50,514
真的没有？
Not really?

195
00:23:50,592 --> 00:23:54,119
这要花上阵子了?
也许一天
So this will take, uh, a while?
I could be done by the end of the day.

196
00:23:54,195 --> 00:23:57,858
或要一周
很难讲
Or it might take a week.
It's difficult to say.

197
00:23:57,932 --> 00:24:03,427
好，你若有任何问题
我会告诉你
Oh. Okay. Uh, well, if you have any
questions, um, I'll let you know.

198
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,809
你认识她?
Did you know her?

199
00:24:44,312 --> 00:24:47,145
可以这么说
Sort of.

200
00:24:47,215 --> 00:24:50,673
她曾是你的邻居?
She was your neighbor?

201
00:24:50,752 --> 00:24:54,415
我当过几次她的褓母
I, uh, I baby-sat her
a couple times.

202
00:24:54,489 --> 00:24:58,448
你和她很熟了?
Oh, so you knew her
pretty well, eh?

203
00:24:58,526 --> 00:25:01,962
是的
Yeah. I did.

204
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,964
你呢?
What about you?

205
00:25:04,032 --> 00:25:09,402
我才诉说这件事
Oh, I just, uh, I heard this thing
was being organized, so-

206
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:12,462
似乎
It seems so, uh...

207
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,304
不像是真的吧?
surreal, doesn't it?

208
00:25:15,376 --> 00:25:18,812
什么?
我们能找到东西
What?
That we'd find anything.

209
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,477
这国家有很多地方可以藏东西
I mean, there's so, uh, many places you
could hide something in this country.

210
00:25:24,552 --> 00:25:29,319
我的名字叫艾瑞克
我叫克莉汀娜
My name's Eric.
I'm Christina.

211
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:32,359
幸会，克莉汀娜
Hey, nice to meet you,
Christina.

212
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,339
怎样?
Well?

213
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:52,971
什么怎样?
你不想摸摸看?
Well, what?
Don't you want to touch it?

214
00:25:54,849 --> 00:25:59,912
不必勉强，有的人喜欢这样做
You don't have to. It's one of
those things people normally like to do.

215
00:25:59,988 --> 00:26:02,718
呵
Ah.

216
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,929
艾瑞克怎会称你漂亮的性感宝贝
What is this thing about Eric
calling you "a sassy piece of jailbait"?

217
00:26:18,006 --> 00:26:21,601
就这事?
它会令我不安
What's this thing?
It bothers me.

218
00:26:21,676 --> 00:26:25,043
为什么?
那使你像个小孩似的样
Why?
It makes you out like a child or something.

219
00:26:25,113 --> 00:26:30,346
和我的穿着打扮完全不搭调?
Unlike the tartan skirt and my socks
or the blouse or the way I act, right?

220
00:26:33,521 --> 00:26:37,855
你觉得奇怪吗?
他仍想留下
Do you find it strange that he
would still want to work here?

221
00:26:37,925 --> 00:26:43,522
佐儿，不是人人都可为所欲为
Zoe, not all of us have the luxury
of deciding what to do with our lives.

222
00:26:43,598 --> 00:26:46,692
他是拿人钱财为人办事
It's a job, and he's
getting paid all right.

223
00:26:46,768 --> 00:26:49,328
我觉得这很残酷
I just find it cruel.

224
00:26:49,404 --> 00:26:51,964
开除他呀
So fire him.

225
00:26:53,775 --> 00:26:56,938
算是帮我的忙
As a favor.

226
00:26:57,011 --> 00:26:59,946
你怎能如此漠不关心?
How can you be so detached?

227
00:28:37,011 --> 00:28:39,571
我今天的活干定了
Well, I'm finished for the day.

228
00:28:39,647 --> 00:28:43,845
今天，你还要回来?
Uh, for the day?
Uh, you mean you have to come back?

229
00:28:43,918 --> 00:28:46,785
恐怕是
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

230
00:28:46,854 --> 00:28:49,118
何时较好?
When is a good time?

231
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,658
你不说只要一天?
But, but, I thought you said
it was only going to take one day.

232
00:28:51,726 --> 00:28:54,456
它是只要一天
Well, it can only take a day.

233
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:58,363
但你的资料放得很凌乱
But you have to understand, you don't
keep very well-organized books.

234
00:28:58,432 --> 00:29:00,923
所以你该找人来帮你忙
That's why you should really think
about getting someone in to help you.

235
00:29:01,002 --> 00:29:04,199
只要一周来一两次
Just somebody to come in
once or twice a week...

236
00:29:04,272 --> 00:29:10,177
视活动的数量及形态而定
depending on the amount of activity
and... the type of activity.

237
00:29:10,244 --> 00:29:13,236
什么意思?
Uh, what do you mean by that?

238
00:29:13,314 --> 00:29:16,477
有些形态或活动更复杂
Well, some types of activity
are more complicated, aren't they?

239
00:29:16,551 --> 00:29:19,520
可能需要较多的心力
It might take more effort
to account for.

240
00:29:19,587 --> 00:29:21,521
哦
Oh.

241
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:24,615
我在抽屉中找到一把枪
I found a gun
in one of the drawers.

242
00:29:24,692 --> 00:29:30,096
那是我爹的
你爹?
Oh, well, that belonged to my dad.
Your dad?

243
00:29:30,164 --> 00:29:34,396
对，他是防备意外用的
Yeah, I guess he just kept it,
uh, just in case.

244
00:29:34,468 --> 00:29:39,235
防备什么?
防范麻烦?
In case of what?
Well, in case of trouble.

245
00:29:39,307 --> 00:29:41,605
动物会有麻烦?
With the animals?

246
00:29:45,513 --> 00:29:48,141
我周一回来好吗
Would Monday be a good time
for me to come back...

247
00:29:48,216 --> 00:29:51,708
品托先生?
好的
Mr. Pinto?
Oh, yeah.

248
00:29:51,786 --> 00:29:53,811
明天呢?
Well, how about, uh, tomorrow?

249
00:29:53,888 --> 00:29:58,120
明天我有约会
周末前我都很忙的
Uh, I have appointments for tomorrow.
Actually, I'm pretty busy 'til the end of the week.

250
00:29:58,192 --> 00:30:00,251
周一不行吗?
Monday's not good?

251
00:30:00,328 --> 00:30:02,956
不会啊，周一很好
No, uh, Monday's fine.

252
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,396
约十点?
好
Around 10:00?
Yeah, sure.

253
00:30:08,302 --> 00:30:10,930
很好
周末愉快
Well, good.
Have a nice weekend.

254
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,567
奇怪那鸟可能比我们活得久
Strange to think that bird
is probably going to outlive us.

255
00:30:42,637 --> 00:30:46,004
奇怪?
Strange?

256
00:30:46,073 --> 00:30:49,304
你可曾教它说话
Did you ever teach it
to say anything?

257
00:30:49,377 --> 00:30:51,311
有的
Yes.

258
00:30:54,448 --> 00:30:59,181
它说什么，哈洛?
它再也不肯说了
What does it say, Harold?
It doesn't really say it anymore.

259
00:30:59,253 --> 00:31:01,153
它忘了？
It forgot?

260
00:31:02,923 --> 00:31:07,917
我想不是
应该不会忘
I don't think so.
They're not supposed to forget.

261
00:31:07,995 --> 00:31:10,930
大概没兴趣吧
It must have just lost interest.

262
00:31:13,934 --> 00:31:17,665
抱歉迟到了
不要紧，我们刚在谈菲利
I'm sorry I'm late.
It's okay. We're just talking about Felix.

263
00:31:17,738 --> 00:31:20,104
它怎样?
What about him?

264
00:31:20,174 --> 00:31:22,506
爹?
Dad?

265
00:31:22,576 --> 00:31:27,377
我给钢琴调过音了，音色真美
I had the piano tuned.
It sounds beautiful.

266
00:31:53,407 --> 00:31:55,841
听来如何?
So, how does it sound?

267
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:58,674
很好
是吗?好
It's good.
Yeah? Good, good.

268
00:31:58,746 --> 00:32:02,182
好，我不会太迟的
怎样是太迟?
Okay, well, I shouldn't be too late.
What's "too late"?

269
00:32:02,249 --> 00:32:05,685
约十一点左右回来?
好
Around 11:00 or so?
Okay.

270
00:32:37,952 --> 00:32:41,217
你要票吗?
You looking for tickets?

271
00:32:41,288 --> 00:32:43,984
对，多少钱?
Uh, yeah. How much?

272
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:16,145
『我要票』

273
00:33:50,224 --> 00:33:53,318
太辣了
That's too hot.

274
00:34:15,316 --> 00:34:18,683
他每隔一晚都会来
He comes in here every other night.

275
00:34:19,253 --> 00:34:23,019
同样的酒
He has his favorite drink...

276
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:27,686
坐他的老位子
找他最欣赏的舞娘
at his favorite table
with his favorite dancer.

277
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:35,198
有时他等她，有时她等他
Sometimes he has to wait for her,
and sometimes she's waiting for him.

278
00:34:35,269 --> 00:34:39,706
她会保护他，她是他的天使
She'll protect him.
She's his angel.

279
00:34:46,213 --> 00:34:50,309
好，各位
表演的时间到了
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
it's show time at the Exotica.

280
00:34:50,384 --> 00:34:52,978
花五块就可...
And just to remind you
that five dollars is all it takes...

281
00:34:53,053 --> 00:34:57,649
找美人儿陪你坐
to have one of our lovely ladies
come over to your table...

282
00:34:57,725 --> 00:35:02,662
她会引导你进入神秘世界
and show you the mysteries
of their world.

283
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:20,973
你若不兴奋就是麻木不仁了
Now if that didn't
turn you on, gentlemen, nothing will.

284
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:26,673
咱们为克莉汀娜鼓掌
Oh, let's have a nice, big, warm round
of applause for Christina, gentlemen!

285
00:36:26,747 --> 00:36:29,147
好呀,克莉汀娜
Yes, Christina!

286
00:36:51,372 --> 00:36:55,468
你在想什么?
What are you thinking?

287
00:36:55,542 --> 00:36:59,979
我在想
如果有人伤害你会怎样?
I was just thinking,
what would happen if someone hurt you?

288
00:37:03,384 --> 00:37:07,650
怎会有人伤害我呢?
H-How could anyone hurt me?

289
00:37:07,721 --> 00:37:12,818
如果我不在附近保护你的话
If I'm not there
to protect you.

290
00:37:15,229 --> 00:37:20,690
你永远会在我身边保护我
You'll always
be there to protect me.

291
00:37:48,529 --> 00:37:51,623
天使
An angel.

292
00:37:51,699 --> 00:37:54,634
嘘
Shh.

293
00:37:59,373 --> 00:38:03,639
怎会有人想做那种事?
Why would somebody want
to do something like that?

294
00:38:05,379 --> 00:38:10,817
怎会有人做那种事?
How could somebody even think
of doing something like that?

295
00:38:10,884 --> 00:38:14,820
别担心了
You mustn't worry.

296
00:38:30,571 --> 00:38:33,665
艾瑞克
Eric! Eric!

297
00:38:33,741 --> 00:38:36,005
哦
Oh.

298
00:38:36,076 --> 00:38:41,810
既性感又疯狂
All hot and bothered, yes, indeed.

299
00:38:41,882 --> 00:38:47,343
来为梅琳鼓掌
Let's have a nice, big
round of applause for Melinda.

300
00:39:41,408 --> 00:39:45,845
拿你的钱令我不安
Uh, listen, I feel bad about,
uh, taking your money.

301
00:39:45,913 --> 00:39:50,350
为什么?
门票是别人送的
Why?
The tickets were given to me, and...

302
00:39:50,417 --> 00:39:53,352
我也该免费送人才对
I should have
given them away for free.

303
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,514
那就太蠢了
为什么?
Well, that would have been stupid.
Why?

304
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:59,354
因为没人会免费送人
Because no one
gives anything away.

305
00:40:00,928 --> 00:40:04,796
你确定吗?是的，我确定
Are you sure?
Yeah, p-positive.

306
00:40:28,455 --> 00:40:32,391
你把我爹当朋友吗?
Do you consider my dad a friend?

307
00:40:32,459 --> 00:40:35,826
你为何问?
只是问问
Why?
J-Just asking.

308
00:40:35,896 --> 00:40:38,729
你把我当朋友吗?
Does he consider me a friend?

309
00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:41,734
很难说
I don't know.

310
00:40:41,802 --> 00:40:43,895
为什么?
Why not?

311
00:40:43,971 --> 00:40:47,839
因为你在附近时他都不太一样
'Cause he always seems
different when you're around.

312
00:40:47,908 --> 00:40:52,242
怎么不一样?
很紧张
Different in what way?
Tense.

313
00:40:54,581 --> 00:40:56,515
那很糟吗?
Is that bad?

314
00:40:56,583 --> 00:41:00,849
我朋友在时我不会很紧张
Well, I don't really like
to feel tense around my friends.

315
00:41:00,921 --> 00:41:03,185
当然
Well, sure, yeah.

316
00:41:03,257 --> 00:41:06,488
我在这年纪时也如此
I didn't like to feel tense around
my friends when I was your age either.

317
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,859
但你现在会紧张
But you do now?

318
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:13,491
这不是喜欢与否的问题
No, it's not a question
of liking it or not.

319
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:17,196
事情就是如此
It's just something that happens.

320
00:41:17,271 --> 00:41:19,535
为什么?
Why?

321
00:41:21,108 --> 00:41:25,704
嗯
Um...

322
00:41:25,779 --> 00:41:30,375
长大后
well... as you get older...

323
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:35,387
你会了解朋友和自己
you become aware that the people
you meet and the person you are...

324
00:41:35,455 --> 00:41:39,653
都有数量不等的包袱
um, as carrying
a certain amount of baggage.

325
00:41:39,726 --> 00:41:44,390
这包袱会制造紧张
And, and that baggage
creates tension.

326
00:41:44,464 --> 00:41:47,831
你要怎么办呢?
So what do you do about it?

327
00:41:47,901 --> 00:41:50,529
你可以假装它不存在
Well, you can pretend
it's not there...

328
00:41:50,604 --> 00:41:54,335
或是选择不交朋友
or you can choose
not to have friends...

329
00:41:54,408 --> 00:41:58,742
或承认它，继续交朋友
or you can acknowledge that
it's there and have friends anyway.

330
00:41:58,812 --> 00:42:01,178
像我爹?
Like my dad?

331
00:42:02,683 --> 00:42:05,015
对
Right.

332
00:42:05,085 --> 00:42:09,317
我爹和你在一起时我不喜欢他
I don't think that I like my dad
when he's around you.

333
00:42:11,925 --> 00:42:15,520
嗯
Hmm.

334
00:42:15,595 --> 00:42:17,688
喂，那是...
Well, that's...

335
00:42:17,764 --> 00:42:22,360
因为他和我一起时不像他自己
because your dad doesn't like himself
when he's around me.

336
00:42:22,436 --> 00:42:24,370
但那无所谓
But that's okay.

337
00:42:24,438 --> 00:42:28,306
朋友间常会如此
That's... part of what friends do
to each other.

338
00:42:32,946 --> 00:42:35,039
晚安晚安
Good night.
Good night.

339
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:04,834
我刚毕业
I, uh-
I just graduated.

340
00:43:04,911 --> 00:43:06,845
真的，我也是
Really?
So did I.

341
00:43:06,913 --> 00:43:10,849
念什么?
无线电通讯?
Oh, yeah? In what?
Radio communications.

342
00:43:10,917 --> 00:43:14,512
你作些什么呢?
那是我想作的
So, so is that what you do?
That's what I'd like to do.

343
00:43:14,588 --> 00:43:17,853
作自由节目主持人
Uh, I do a little
freelance deejay stuff...

344
00:43:17,924 --> 00:43:21,018
但现在我只开计程车
but, you know, right now
I'm just driving a cab.

345
00:43:21,094 --> 00:43:24,860
我想你就是作那种事的
开计程车?
I thought you might do something like that.
Drive a cab?

346
00:43:24,931 --> 00:43:29,868
不，做与用嗓子有关的事
为什么?
No, do something where, you use your voice.
Why?

347
00:43:29,936 --> 00:43:34,805
我不知道，因为你的声音好听
I don't know why.
Because you're easy to listen to.

348
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:38,367
因为我的声音?
Because of my voice, eh?

349
00:43:56,897 --> 00:44:00,993
我需要找个合适的环境
I just need to find
a structure, you know?

350
00:44:01,068 --> 00:44:03,002
你的意思是?
What do you mean?

351
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:07,666
我浪费好多时间
时光飞逝
Listen, I waste so much time, you know?
I just My days just slip by, you know?

352
00:44:07,741 --> 00:44:11,871
时光本来不就会消逝吗?
Isn't that what days are supposed to do?
Yeah.

353
00:44:11,945 --> 00:44:15,346
你想做事就不希望如此
Not if you want to make
something of yourself, you know?

354
00:44:15,415 --> 00:44:19,511
你想做什么事呢?
What do you
want to make of yourself?

355
00:44:19,586 --> 00:44:24,023
我不知道，我就是有这想法
I don't know. I just feel that I was
meant to do something with my time.

356
00:44:24,091 --> 00:44:28,858
否则我不会这样想
I mean, otherwise, I wouldn't be
thinking of this this way.

357
00:44:28,929 --> 00:44:33,195
顶多只会继续做已经做的事
I'd be able to just
continue what I was doing, you know?

358
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,207
你有很多朋友吗?
Do you have a lot of friends?

359
00:44:47,013 --> 00:44:50,949
没有，你有吗?
Not really. Do you?

360
00:44:51,017 --> 00:44:54,316
没有
No.
Yeah.

361
00:44:54,387 --> 00:44:59,620
你想过会需要位朋友吗?
Do you ever feel like you need a friend?

362
00:44:59,693 --> 00:45:03,151
有时会
Yeah, sometimes.

363
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:06,290
何时?
When?

364
00:45:06,366 --> 00:45:08,960
像是现在
Like right now.

365
00:45:09,035 --> 00:45:11,799
为什么?
Why?

366
00:45:11,872 --> 00:45:14,966
因为我遇见你
'Cause I just met you and...

367
00:45:15,041 --> 00:45:18,477
我有话想说
I just feel like
telling someone, you know?

368
00:45:58,685 --> 00:46:02,781
不行，不行
No way.
No way, no way.

369
00:46:05,525 --> 00:46:07,618
嗨
Hi.
Hi.

370
00:46:07,694 --> 00:46:10,788
老天
怎么回事?
Jesus.
What's the matter?

371
00:46:10,864 --> 00:46:14,095
怎么回事?
她的假发 她的服装
"What's the matter?"
Her wigs, her clothes.

372
00:46:14,167 --> 00:46:18,297
有时我真想把它们扔掉
Sometimes I just feel like
throwing them all away, you know?

373
00:46:18,371 --> 00:46:20,464
你在找什么，佐儿
What are you looking for, Zoe?

374
00:46:26,046 --> 00:46:28,810
你准备把未来寄托在这上面?
我的未来?
I mean, is this where you see your future?
My future?

375
00:46:30,884 --> 00:46:32,818
俱乐部?
The club?

376
00:46:35,488 --> 00:46:40,983
妈死后我只想把这地方卖掉
When Mom died, my immediate idea was
to get rid of this place. Just sell it.

377
00:46:41,061 --> 00:46:46,226
从未想过我会对它感兴趣
为什么呢?
I never thought it would have any interest for me.
So why did it?

378
00:46:52,339 --> 00:46:55,103
我小时侯非常害羞
I used to be very shy
as a child.

379
00:46:55,175 --> 00:46:57,769
我会花数小时看着母亲
I used to watch
my mother for hours...

380
00:46:57,844 --> 00:47:01,610
仰慕她的自由奔放
just admiring
her sense of freedom.

381
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:07,218
所以机会来时我会接受挑战
So when the opportunity came up,
I thought I would take on the challenge.

382
00:47:07,287 --> 00:47:12,156
你宁可接受她的建议?
So you feel better about adopting her
options rather than creating your own?

383
00:47:14,027 --> 00:47:16,188
我也有自己意见
I have created
my own options too.

384
00:47:16,263 --> 00:47:18,629
我知道
Oh, I know.

385
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,903
这是你和艾瑞克对孩子的合约
It's your contract
for the baby with Eric.

386
00:47:30,977 --> 00:47:33,343
我找到的
I found it.

387
00:47:33,413 --> 00:47:36,473
他知道吗?
Does he know?

388
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:38,915
希望如此
I would hope so.

389
00:47:38,985 --> 00:47:43,922
否则他会以为我故意讨厌他
Otherwise he might just think I'm
disgusted with him for no particular reason.

390
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:49,492
我迫切地需要这孩子
Look, I really desperately
needed this child...

391
00:47:49,562 --> 00:47:52,588
艾瑞克很合作
and it just worked out
with Eric.

392
00:47:52,666 --> 00:47:55,294
我并没有伤害你的意思
I didn't mean
to hurt you.

393
00:47:55,368 --> 00:47:58,997
我记得你母亲建这玄关的事
You know, I remember
when your mother built this hallway.

394
00:47:59,072 --> 00:48:04,305
她是为一位常来的富人而建的
She, uh, she built it for this
very rich man who used to come here.

395
00:48:06,613 --> 00:48:10,105
看我们跳舞令他兴奋
所以他付钱请她
He used to get off watching us dance for
other guys, so he actually paid her...

396
00:48:10,183 --> 00:48:13,710
建了这个特殊的地方
方便他来看我们
to construct this very special place
that he could watch us from.

397
00:48:15,488 --> 00:48:17,718
你母亲从未告诉我们那事
Your mother never told us that.

398
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:20,385
她说它是用来保护我们的
She said it was
to protect us...

399
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,395
便于看管
so she could patrol things.

400
00:48:26,666 --> 00:48:28,793
我一直相信
And I believed her.

401
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:32,964
直到艾瑞克揭穿
Until Eric told me the truth.

402
00:48:35,909 --> 00:48:37,843
你为何相信他?
Why did you believe him?

403
00:48:37,911 --> 00:48:40,311
我作了选择
I made a choice.

404
00:48:43,316 --> 00:48:47,912
艾瑞克承诺我保证他绝不说谎
And Eric promised me
he'd never lie to me.

405
00:49:29,863 --> 00:49:33,321
怎会有人
How could anyone...

406
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,834
伤害你?
hurt you?

407
00:49:40,373 --> 00:49:43,308
把你从我身边带走?
Take you away from me?

408
00:49:48,248 --> 00:49:50,876
怎会有这种人?
How could anyone?

409
00:50:38,731 --> 00:50:41,700
这是什么机器?
What's this machine?

410
00:50:41,768 --> 00:50:44,703
是孵卵器
Uh, uh, it's an incubator.

411
00:50:44,771 --> 00:50:49,538
干什么用的?
你认为呢?
Wh-What's it for?
Well, what do you think it's for?

412
00:50:49,609 --> 00:50:52,134
孵蛋的 没错
Eggs.
That's right.

413
00:50:52,212 --> 00:50:55,272
是你的蛋?
Are they yours?

414
00:50:55,348 --> 00:50:57,942
什么意思?
Wh-What do you mean?

415
00:50:58,017 --> 00:51:02,579
你不是该坐在上吗?
I mean, shouldn't you be sitting on them or something?
Oh, yeah.

416
00:51:02,655 --> 00:51:05,954
我想我是放弃了巢
Well, I guess
I've abandoned the nest.

417
00:51:15,368 --> 00:51:20,465
里面是什么?
What's inside of them?

418
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:24,636
蛋？
是的
Uh, the eggs?
Yes.

419
00:51:24,711 --> 00:51:27,305
金刚鹦鹉
Well, uh, Hyacinth Macaws...

420
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:30,247
如果你想知道的话
if you want to know
the absolute truth.

421
00:51:30,316 --> 00:51:32,910
从那里弄来的?
And where did you get them?

422
00:51:32,986 --> 00:51:38,754
很远的地方
From... very far away.

423
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,934
要试试她?
Hey, check her out, eh?

424
00:51:59,846 --> 00:52:03,043
试试她吧
I said check her out.

425
00:52:03,116 --> 00:52:07,280
你在跟我说话?
Yeah.
You talking to me?

426
00:52:07,353 --> 00:52:11,289
对，我跟你说话
Uh, yes,
I'm talking to you.

427
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,623
试试谁?
What? Check who out?

428
00:52:15,695 --> 00:52:18,391
为你跳舞的女郎
The babe that's dancing
for you, man.

429
00:52:18,464 --> 00:52:22,628
你为她花了不少钱
You've given her quite a run
for your money, man.

430
00:52:22,702 --> 00:52:25,466
什么意思?
What do you mean by that?

431
00:52:25,538 --> 00:52:29,565
她整晚都在为你跳舞
She's been dancing for you all night.
Yeah.

432
00:52:29,642 --> 00:52:33,635
不只是今晚，还有别的夜晚
Yeah, and not just tonight. I mean, I've
noticed you with her other nights too.

433
00:52:36,649 --> 00:52:40,176
你常来这儿?
You come in here all the time or-

434
00:52:40,253 --> 00:52:44,917
对，常来
Uh... yeah.
All the time.

435
00:52:44,991 --> 00:52:49,587
有片子看，你知道的
好
This Visuals, you know?
It's good.

436
00:52:49,662 --> 00:52:52,927
可是
But, uh...

437
00:52:52,999 --> 00:52:57,834
她似乎对你有点兴趣，对吗?
she seems to have a bit
of a thing for you, doesn't she?

438
00:52:59,672 --> 00:53:03,233
我们处得来
We, uh... get along.

439
00:53:03,309 --> 00:53:07,439
我想是朋友
I'm sure you do, my friend.

440
00:53:07,513 --> 00:53:11,279
你们谈什么?
What do you two
talk about, huh?

441
00:53:11,351 --> 00:53:16,948
一般的事
Oh, just, uh...
the usual, I guess.

442
00:53:17,023 --> 00:53:18,957
一般?
The usual?

443
00:53:19,025 --> 00:53:23,962
我想不是如此吧
I don't think you're talking
about what I would call "usual. "

444
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:26,794
为什么?
因为我看得出来
Why not?
Because I can tell.

445
00:53:26,866 --> 00:53:30,393
你很专注
You get pretty intense,
my friend.

446
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:32,995
我想我是那样
Well, I guess that's
just the way I am.

447
00:53:36,643 --> 00:53:41,910
你何不摸摸她?
So, uh, Hey, wh-why don't you
give her a little touch, huh?

448
00:53:41,981 --> 00:53:47,749
客人不应该摸的
对，但她喜欢，相信我
You're not supposed to touch.
Ah, but she is into it, believe me.

449
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:51,085

Yeah.

450
00:53:51,157 --> 00:53:56,595
你怎么知道
大家都知道，老兄
How do you know?
Everybody knows, man.

451
00:53:56,663 --> 00:53:59,393
相信我，朋友
Trust me, my friend.

452
00:53:59,465 --> 00:54:03,424
相信我，摸一下
Trust me.
Just a little touch.

453
00:54:03,503 --> 00:54:07,599
不必太夸张
Nothing too drastic.

454
00:54:07,674 --> 00:54:11,940
你会有美妙经验
Then you will get
the full experience, my friend...

455
00:54:12,011 --> 00:54:14,571
你会喜欢的
and you will love it.

456
00:54:14,647 --> 00:54:19,107
你会喜欢的，你会的
You will love it. Okay?

457
00:54:19,185 --> 00:54:23,849
我摸她会出什么事?
And what happens
when I touch her?

458
00:54:23,923 --> 00:54:28,451
出什么事?
What happens?

459
00:55:03,996 --> 00:55:07,693
离开这儿
出去
You're outta here, man!
Get out!

460
00:55:11,003 --> 00:55:13,767
进来
跪下
Come on.
Get down there.

461
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,502
进来 走吧
Come on. Go.

462
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,853
嗨，你在搞什么鬼
别挡在路中央
Hey, what the hell you doin'?
Get off the road!

463
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:43,263
走
Move!

464
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:05,555
什么事这么好笑?
What's so funny?

465
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:08,719
这像爱抚一只大猩猩
It's like pettin' a gorilla.

466
00:56:08,795 --> 00:56:11,560
喂
Well-

467
00:56:11,631 --> 00:56:14,567
你父亲有这么多毛吗?
Was your father this hairy?

468
00:56:14,634 --> 00:56:18,731
没有，我是从母亲处遗传来的
No, I, uh, I got it
from my mother.

469
00:56:18,805 --> 00:56:21,240
从我母亲家族那里
I mean, I mean,
from my mother's side of the family.

470
00:56:21,308 --> 00:56:27,076
人通常自母系遗传到毛发特徵
That's where you, um,
inherit hair patterns.

471
00:56:27,147 --> 00:56:32,017
我舅父是秃子
你妈的兄弟?
My uncle's bald.
On your mother's side?

472
00:56:32,086 --> 00:56:34,520
对
Mm-hmm.

473
00:56:34,589 --> 00:56:38,354
我谈的是一般的情形
Well, um, I guess I'm talking
about usual patterns.

474
00:56:38,425 --> 00:56:42,863
有时也有例外
Hmm.
There's always exceptions.

475
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:45,523
这是
That's-

476
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:51,038
通常都是如此的
That's the way these things... work.

477
00:57:01,949 --> 00:57:04,782
你不是该到医院去?
Shouldn't you go
to the hospital?

478
00:57:04,851 --> 00:57:07,877
不，我很好
No, I'm fine.

479
00:57:07,955 --> 00:57:11,890
你看来不好
You don't look fine.

480
00:57:11,958 --> 00:57:15,258
别担心我，对不对?
You worry about me, don't you?

481
00:57:15,329 --> 00:57:19,389
你认为这很正常?
You think this is normal?

482
00:57:19,467 --> 00:57:23,699
什么?
我们做的事?
What?
What we do.

483
00:57:26,139 --> 00:57:28,505
我们做了什么?
What do we do?

484
00:57:30,577 --> 00:57:33,410
我们从不谈它
That's just it.
We don't speak about it.

485
00:57:33,481 --> 00:57:39,351
你知道那感觉，崔西
You know that feeling
you get sometimes, Tracey...

486
00:57:39,419 --> 00:57:42,650
你不是自愿来到这世界的?
that you didn't ask to be
brought into the world?

487
00:57:44,424 --> 00:57:46,358
是的
Yeah.

488
00:57:48,262 --> 00:57:50,457
谁又是呢?
Well, then who did?

489
00:57:50,531 --> 00:57:52,691
什么?
What?

490
00:57:52,767 --> 00:57:55,132
你自问是不是
If you think that
you didn't ask...

491
00:57:55,203 --> 00:57:59,138
自愿出生的
to be brought
into the world...

492
00:57:59,207 --> 00:58:01,767
谁又是呢?
then who did?

493
00:58:15,923 --> 00:58:21,054
没有人会问你是否自愿来此
All I'm saying is nobody asked you if
you wanted to be brought into the world.

494
00:58:21,127 --> 00:58:24,564
你就是来到这世界
You just ended up getting here.

495
00:58:26,633 --> 00:58:30,661
问题是你既然来了
So the question is,
now that you're here...

496
00:58:30,738 --> 00:58:34,674
谁又要你留下呢?
who's asking you to stay?

497
00:58:45,252 --> 00:58:48,187
谢谢
谢谢你
Thanks.
Thank you.

498
00:58:48,256 --> 00:58:51,554
你确定你没事?
Look, are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

499
00:58:51,626 --> 00:58:54,526
是的
Yes.

500
00:58:54,595 --> 00:58:56,585
晚安
Good night.

501
00:59:01,769 --> 00:59:03,703
晚安
Good night.

502
00:59:12,513 --> 00:59:14,537
他摸了你?
他不想如此做的
He touched you?
He didn't want to.

503
00:59:14,614 --> 00:59:17,607
什么意思?
我了解他
What do you mean?
I know him.

504
00:59:17,685 --> 00:59:22,679
我们都知他为你狂
不是那样的
We all know him. He's crazy about you.
Not like that.

505
00:59:22,757 --> 00:59:24,918
何不找人处理这事，艾瑞克?
Why didn't you get one of the boys
to handle this, Eric?

506
00:59:24,991 --> 00:59:28,222
因为我没用头脑想
Because I didn't think of it.

507
00:59:28,295 --> 00:59:30,763
我看到他摸她，我就
I just saw him touch her, and-

508
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:32,822
你为何不叫他离开?
Why didn't you
ask him to leave?

509
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,095
他不会听的
你怎么知道?
Because he wouldn't have listened.
How do you know that?

510
00:59:35,168 --> 00:59:38,161
他只活在他自己世界里
Because he's in his own world,
the ass-wipe.

511
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:40,434
我不知你俩怎么回事
I don't know
where you're both coming from.

512
00:59:40,507 --> 00:59:44,842
你说他摸你，但实际上没有
You are telling me that he touched you,
but he really didn't.

513
00:59:44,912 --> 00:59:48,439
你说你反应过度别无选择
And you're saying that you overreacted,
but you didn't have a choice?

514
00:59:48,515 --> 00:59:52,282
我没有
为什么?
I didn't.
Why not?

515
00:59:52,352 --> 00:59:57,814
为什么?因为他摸了你
Why not?
Because he touched you.

516
00:59:57,891 --> 01:00:01,191
好了
Okay.

517
01:00:01,261 --> 01:00:03,890
我想知道他说的否有理
All I'm concerned about
is if he makes a case...

518
01:00:03,963 --> 01:00:07,694
我得知道事情经过
I have to know
what happened.

519
01:00:07,768 --> 01:00:09,826
我们告诉过你过程了，佐儿
We told you
what happened, Zoe.

520
01:00:09,903 --> 01:00:13,032
那是过程?
And that is what happened?

521
01:00:18,278 --> 01:00:21,737
对
Yeah.
Okay.

522
01:00:21,816 --> 01:00:24,682
好，谈完了吗?
Is that it?

523
01:00:27,621 --> 01:00:29,713
这是汤玛士
Hi. This is Thomas.

524
01:00:29,789 --> 01:00:32,054
我现在不在，在城里
I am not in at the present time,
but I am in town.

525
01:00:32,126 --> 01:00:36,893
请於『哔』声后留话
Please leave a message
following the beep.

526
01:00:36,963 --> 01:00:39,056
早安
Good morning.

527
01:00:39,133 --> 01:00:43,569
你没起床就不会看到做的
You're probably not up yet,
so you haven't seen what I've done.

528
01:00:43,636 --> 01:00:47,232
我是机场关员
I'm a customs officer
at the airport.

529
01:00:47,307 --> 01:00:52,405
我的确看到你取走了待验的提包
Actually, I saw you the other day when
you were having your bags inspected.

530
01:00:52,479 --> 01:00:56,415
我知道你如何走私这些蛋
I knowI know how you probably
smuggled those eggs in.

531
01:00:56,484 --> 01:01:01,251
我们有特别单位
我想他们将它们送到动物园了
There's a special unit at work. I think
they give them to the zoo or something.

532
01:01:01,321 --> 01:01:06,258
他们问我来源，我只好说谎
They asked me where I got them.
I had to lie.

533
01:01:06,326 --> 01:01:08,261
它们在那?
Where are they?

534
01:01:08,328 --> 01:01:10,922
我拿走了
在哪里
I took them.
Where?

535
01:01:10,998 --> 01:01:13,932
我想再见你 不
I'd like to see you again.
Oh, no.

536
01:01:14,001 --> 01:01:16,799
它们绝对在国内
Uh, no, they're in the country now.
Uh, they're definitely in the country.

537
01:01:16,871 --> 01:01:20,773
现在不在我身上，但在我这儿
It's just I don't have them, uh, with me
presently, but it doesn't mean I can't get them.

538
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:24,105
只要你给我
And if you can give me, like,
uh, just, uh, um, a couple-

539
01:01:24,177 --> 01:01:27,272
早安
好，我在这儿
Good morning.
Hi. Uh, and, uh, I'm here. Okay.

540
01:01:27,347 --> 01:01:30,374
我们以后再谈
So I'll call-
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

541
01:01:30,451 --> 01:01:32,885
你看来比我更糟糕
You look like you're
in worse shape than I am.

542
01:01:32,953 --> 01:01:36,047
你怎么回事?
Uh... what happened to you?

543
01:01:36,123 --> 01:01:38,886
我从楼上摔下来
Oh, I fell down
some stairs and-

544
01:01:38,958 --> 01:01:42,554
你没事?
我看起来像没事?
Are you okay?
Well, do I look okay?

545
01:01:42,629 --> 01:01:47,066
不，不尽然 我比外表更健康
我给你弄了杯咖啡
Uh, no, not really. Well, I'm better than I look. 
Here, I got you a coffee.

546
01:01:47,133 --> 01:01:49,898
你要怎么喝
I didn't, uh-
I didn't know how you took it.

547
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:52,234
纯的就好
Oh, black's fine.
Oh.

548
01:01:52,306 --> 01:01:55,400
我加了奶精
那也行
Uh, I added cream.
Oh, that's okay.

549
01:01:55,475 --> 01:01:59,241
喝我的 不，我坚持
不，真的
No, here, have mine. No, I insist.
No, really-

550
01:02:02,816 --> 01:02:04,910
这是什么?
What is it?

551
01:02:04,984 --> 01:02:09,080
这里面也有奶精
Well, it's just that
this has cream in it too.

552
01:02:09,155 --> 01:02:11,749
这是牛奶
It's milk.

553
01:02:11,826 --> 01:02:14,590
很好
Oh. Oh, good.

554
01:02:14,662 --> 01:02:16,595
好，好，我要-
Okay, well, I'll, uh-

555
01:02:16,664 --> 01:02:19,599
我要工作了
I'll get to work.

556
01:03:03,977 --> 01:03:06,571
嗯，什么
Mmm, what?

557
01:03:06,647 --> 01:03:09,080
是什么呢?
What is it?

558
01:03:09,148 --> 01:03:13,744
什么使女学生天真无邪?
What is it that gives a schoolgirl
her special innocence?

559
01:03:15,489 --> 01:03:19,424
是她们的气味?
Is it the way they smell?

560
01:03:19,492 --> 01:03:24,429
她们和香水或头发的气味
The sweet smell
of their perfume, of their hair?

561
01:03:24,498 --> 01:03:28,991
鲜花的香气
The aroma
of fresh flowers...

562
01:03:29,068 --> 01:03:31,037
没破坏的身体
and all that other stuff
that hasn't been fucked up...

563
01:03:31,104 --> 01:03:34,540
被通宵及坏食物
by late nights
and a lot of bad food.

564
01:03:37,443 --> 01:03:43,212
是她们的姿势?她们的动作
Is it their gestures...
and the way they move?

565
01:03:43,284 --> 01:03:48,381
她们身躯展现的自尊
The way their body still holds on
to some semblance of self-respect and...

566
01:03:48,455 --> 01:03:52,220
及端庄?
and dignity?

567
01:03:52,292 --> 01:03:56,559
还是她们的玉腿
When they wrap
their beautiful legs around you...

568
01:03:56,629 --> 01:04:00,566
紧绕着你
她看着你
tight and holding on,
looking at you...

569
01:04:00,633 --> 01:04:02,567
你看她们
you looking at them.

570
01:04:02,635 --> 01:04:05,901
这只是
It's just-

571
01:04:05,973 --> 01:04:08,736
还是她们樱桃小嘴吐出的话?
Or is it whatever comes out
of their cute little mouths?

572
01:04:08,808 --> 01:04:12,244
那些问题及怀疑?
All those questions,
all that wondering that-

573
01:04:17,317 --> 01:04:21,913
她们仍有一大段人生待走
It's just, you know, you
They got their whole lives ahead of them, you know?

574
01:04:21,989 --> 01:04:25,425
而你却巳虚掷大半光阴
And you've wasted
half of yours away.

575
01:04:25,492 --> 01:04:27,426
该死
Damn.

576
01:04:29,162 --> 01:04:31,255
是什么?
What is it?

577
01:04:33,767 --> 01:04:36,860
我有时有这感受
There's this feeling
I get sometimes, you know?

578
01:04:36,936 --> 01:04:39,531
什么感受?
What sort of feeling?

579
01:04:39,606 --> 01:04:44,543
我永远无法得到满足
That I wasn't ever meant
to be satisfied.

580
01:04:44,611 --> 01:04:47,705
对什么满足?
Satisfied with what?

581
01:04:47,781 --> 01:04:50,215
对许多事物
A lot of things.

582
01:04:50,283 --> 01:04:52,718
我的意思是，每次我...
I mean, it seems to me
that every time I'm about to...

583
01:04:52,786 --> 01:04:57,223
要抓住某物或某人时...
you know, get a hold
of something or someone...

584
01:04:57,291 --> 01:05:02,557
总会失之交臂
it's just bound
to slip away.

585
01:05:02,629 --> 01:05:05,224
也许你希望机会错失?
Maybe you want it
to slip away.

586
01:05:05,298 --> 01:05:08,563
也许我希望机会错失?
Maybe I want what
to slip away?

587
01:05:08,635 --> 01:05:13,733
你就快拥有的物或人
The things that you think
you're about to have.

588
01:05:13,806 --> 01:05:17,572
你怎么会这样想?
What would you
think about that?

589
01:05:17,644 --> 01:05:20,739
是作为笼统的哲学思想...
As a general philosophy...

590
01:05:20,813 --> 01:05:23,077
还是去让它适合你呢?
or how it pertains to you?

591
01:05:23,149 --> 01:05:26,244
你能谈它与我的关系?
You think you could talk
about how it pertains to me?

592
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,753
什么意思?
What do you mean?

593
01:05:28,821 --> 01:05:32,849
我觉得我想要你
Well, I feel
like I want you.

594
01:05:32,926 --> 01:05:38,023
那表示你会离开?
Do you think that means
you'll slip away?

595
01:05:43,771 --> 01:05:46,466
爹?
Dad?

596
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:51,306
我不要为佛兰西作褓母
I'm not going to baby-sit
for Uncle Francis anymore.

597
01:05:51,378 --> 01:05:54,541
褓母?你是去练习钢琴的呀
Baby-sit?
You go there to practice.

598
01:05:54,614 --> 01:05:57,879
那真荒谬
That's absurd.

599
01:05:57,951 --> 01:06:00,350
为什么?
Why?

600
01:06:00,421 --> 01:06:05,723
爹，他假装我仍为他当褓母
Dad, he pretends
I'm still baby-sitting for him.

601
01:06:05,792 --> 01:06:08,226
你怎会那样想?
Why would you think that?

602
01:06:08,295 --> 01:06:10,263
因为他付钱给我
Because he's paying me.

603
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:13,196
看房子
To house-sit.

604
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:19,529
一小时廿元?
Twenty dollars an hour?

605
01:06:19,605 --> 01:06:23,007
何时涨价的?
When did it go up?

606
01:06:23,076 --> 01:06:25,909
他想假装莉莎仍在那儿
He wants to believe
that Lisa's still there.

607
01:06:25,979 --> 01:06:29,038
我等於在帮他欺骗自己
I make it easier for him
to convince himself.

608
01:06:31,752 --> 01:06:36,188
佛兰西常用古怪的方法欺骗自己
Francis always had strange ways
to convince himself...

609
01:06:36,255 --> 01:06:39,191
在许多事情上
of many things.

610
01:06:39,258 --> 01:06:45,027
幻想从未发生的事和可能事
Things that never happened,
things that might happen.

611
01:06:45,099 --> 01:06:50,696
幻想别人做了什么事
People who did things
for reasons, but they didn't.

612
01:06:52,773 --> 01:06:57,210
这跟我何干，爹?
What has any of this
got to do with me, Dad?

613
01:07:00,279 --> 01:07:03,715
无关
Nothing.

614
01:07:03,783 --> 01:07:06,878
完全无关
Nothing at all.

615
01:07:06,954 --> 01:07:10,889
那我为何一直得去?
So why do I have
to keep going there?

616
01:07:10,957 --> 01:07:13,221
你不必去
You don't.

617
01:07:13,292 --> 01:07:15,726
你会告诉他?
And you'll tell him?

618
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:25,061
那晚那家伙被赶走时我在这儿
I was in here the other night
when that guy was thrown out.

619
01:07:25,138 --> 01:07:29,837
为何发生?
他曾被赶出去吗?
Why did that happen?
Has he ever been thrown out before?

620
01:07:29,909 --> 01:07:34,005
你想他为何摸你?
你想他为何摸你?
Why do you think he would touch you?
Why do you think he would touch you?

621
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:37,175
你想他为何摸你?
Why do you think he would touch you?

622
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:40,845
他的脑中闪过什么念头?
Well, what do you think
was going through his mind when he-

623
01:07:40,921 --> 01:07:44,516
或他在想什么?
Or-Or what was he thinking?

624
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:47,185
什么事这么好笑?
Well-
What's so funny?

625
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:49,195
这是个笑话，对吗?
Well, this is a joke, right?

626
01:07:49,263 --> 01:07:51,527
完全不是
Not at all.

627
01:07:51,598 --> 01:07:56,330
你帮我忙我就帮你
If you do this favor for me,
I'll do that favor for you.

628
01:07:59,438 --> 01:08:02,100
但我没隐藏什么?
But I'm not hiding anything.

629
01:08:02,176 --> 01:08:06,475
汤玛士，你在隐藏走私行动
Thomas, you're hiding
a smuggling operation...

630
01:08:06,547 --> 01:08:11,541
它每年获利廿万或更多
that brings in over $200,000 a year,
probably a lot more.

631
01:08:11,618 --> 01:08:13,643
我们怀疑你好久了
We've suspected you
for a long time.

632
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:17,211
我只是证实巳知的事实
I was just brought in to confirm
what was already known.

633
01:08:17,291 --> 01:08:19,782
你要我怎样回报?
So how do you want me
to report back?

634
01:08:23,629 --> 01:08:27,292
我只要求帮个小忙
All I'm asking
for is a bit of help.

635
01:08:27,367 --> 01:08:29,927
仅此而已
That's all.

636
01:08:30,003 --> 01:08:34,565
知道这些事是很重要的
代我问她这些问题
It's very important for me to know these
things. Just ask her these questions.

637
01:08:34,641 --> 01:08:38,907
替我做这事你就可重新作人
Do this for me,
and you have a clean slate.

638
01:08:38,979 --> 01:08:44,781
今天我真是倒霉
This really hasn't been my day.

639
01:08:44,851 --> 01:08:49,288
改变一切让今天运气转
So change things.
Make it your day.

640
01:08:51,425 --> 01:08:53,859
坐在舞台前的男士们
我能看到你们
And all you men sitting
near that stage, I can see you.

641
01:08:53,927 --> 01:08:56,019
我知道你们的想法
I know what you're thinking.

642
01:08:56,095 --> 01:08:59,360
你们想因为我离舞台最近
You're thinking that "because I'm
sitting next to that stage...

643
01:08:59,432 --> 01:09:02,196
我和花钱者一样享受
I'm getting the same feeling
as all those guys...

644
01:09:02,268 --> 01:09:06,205
既然已经为你们的私人舞女花过钱
shoveling out that cash
for their own private dancer. "

645
01:09:06,273 --> 01:09:10,369
你们若只想看不如去看电影
Well, you know, you guys want
to watch, go to the movies.

646
01:09:10,444 --> 01:09:13,207
这儿可真刀真枪现场表演
We're in the live-action
business here, gents.

647
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:19,047
那美女在你面前扭动
And, okay, granted
Granted, that beautiful creature writhing before you on stage...

648
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:22,212
她也许向你笑
she maybe, you know, smiles at you.

649
01:09:22,288 --> 01:09:24,223
对你抛媚眼
She winks her eyes at you occasionally...

650
01:09:24,291 --> 01:09:26,555
你也许自觉像男人
and you may feel like the man.

651
01:09:26,627 --> 01:09:28,618
你们只想要那样?
Is that all you guys
are looking for?

652
01:09:28,695 --> 01:09:32,653
还是全都要？
别这样
Is that all you want?
Come on, come on.

653
01:09:32,733 --> 01:09:36,668
请一位美女到你面前表演
Invite one of our lovely ladies over
to your table where the real action is.

654
01:09:36,736 --> 01:09:39,330

嗨
Yeah!
Hi.

655
01:09:39,406 --> 01:09:41,999
抱歉花了这么久时间
I'm really sorry that took so long,
or I took so long.

656
01:09:42,075 --> 01:09:44,167
今晚真忙
Hi.
It's such a busy night.

657
01:09:44,244 --> 01:09:47,178
我是克莉汀娜
Hi. I'm Chrissy.

658
01:09:47,247 --> 01:09:50,010
嗨，我是汤玛土
Hi. I'm Thomas.

659
01:09:50,082 --> 01:09:54,519
幸会，汤玛土
喜欢这名字
It's nice to meet you, Thomas.
I like the name Thomas a lot.

660
01:09:54,587 --> 01:09:56,522
谢了
Oh, thanks.

661
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:58,682
你是外地人?
Are you from out of town?

662
01:09:58,758 --> 01:10:00,692
是的
Yes.

663
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:03,024
你来自何处?
Where are you from?

664
01:10:03,095 --> 01:10:07,191
旧金山
Um... San Francisco.

665
01:10:07,267 --> 01:10:10,031
你开玩笑?我爱旧金山
Oh, you're kidding.
I love San Francisco.

666
01:10:10,103 --> 01:10:12,696
你去过那儿?
Oh, you've-
You've been there?

667
01:10:12,773 --> 01:10:18,040
对，几年前我和大辨论队去过
Yeah, I was there a couple of years ago
with my debating team.

668
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:20,204
你的辨论队?
Debating team?
Mm-hmm.

669
01:10:20,279 --> 01:10:24,046
对
我崇敬会辩论的人
Um, that's. I admire
someone who can debate well.

670
01:10:24,117 --> 01:10:27,210
我是说辩论，不是耍嘴皮
I mean, who can debate
instead of just argue.

671
01:10:27,287 --> 01:10:31,724
任何人都会耍嘴皮
Well, anyone can argue, but it's
a good skill, uh, discipline...

672
01:10:31,792 --> 01:10:34,556
辩论不同
to be able to debate
and stand back.

673
01:10:34,628 --> 01:10:37,893
它在实际生活上也用得到
Um, and that's something
you can apply in your life...

674
01:10:37,965 --> 01:10:40,229
在学校外面
outside of school.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

675
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:43,234
当你碰见某人，或谈判时
And, and when you're meeting
someone or negotiating.

676
01:10:43,302 --> 01:10:47,739
谈判?
如果有此需要的话
Negotiating?
Well, I mean, if you have... If you have to...

677
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:52,744
这是一项很有用的技能
Um, it's a good skill to learn,
as opposed to cheerleading or-

678
01:10:52,812 --> 01:10:54,747
那正是我说的
Well, that's what I say.

679
01:10:54,815 --> 01:10:57,249
别紧张，汤玛土
Don't be nervous
about this, Thomas.

680
01:10:57,316 --> 01:11:00,753
我们来找乐子，好吗?
好呀
We're gonna have some fun, okay?
Sure.

681
01:11:00,821 --> 01:11:03,415
好
Sure.

682
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:20,596
嗯
Um... um...

683
01:11:20,673 --> 01:11:24,940
那晚我在这儿
I was here
the other night, um-

684
01:11:25,012 --> 01:11:26,946
哪一晚?
What night was that?

685
01:11:27,013 --> 01:11:30,210
那家伙被赶出去那晚
The night th-that guy
was thrown out.

686
01:11:30,282 --> 01:11:32,547
你正为他跳舞?
You were dancing for him.

687
01:11:32,619 --> 01:11:35,553
他叫佛兰西
His name is Francis.

688
01:11:35,622 --> 01:11:38,147
出了什么事?
Um... what happened?

689
01:11:42,796 --> 01:11:45,730
他是坏孩子
He was a bad boy.

690
01:11:45,798 --> 01:11:50,667
什么意思?
什么意思?
Wh-What do you mean by that?
What do I mean?

691
01:11:50,736 --> 01:11:53,763
你以前常为他跳舞吗?
I mean, have you danced
for him before a lot?

692
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,773
嗯
Mm-hmm.

693
01:11:55,841 --> 01:11:58,970
他可曾被赶出去过?
没有
And has he ever been thrown out before?
No.

694
01:11:59,046 --> 01:12:01,206
那你想出了什么事?
So what do you
think happened?

695
01:12:01,281 --> 01:12:04,408
他摸我
He touched me.

696
01:12:04,484 --> 01:12:07,418
跳舞时客人...
And when you're dancing
for the customer...

697
01:12:07,486 --> 01:12:10,250
不能动手摸的
they can't touch.

698
01:12:10,322 --> 01:12:13,156
对，但他昨晚为何摸你?
Yes, but why do you think
he touched you last night?

699
01:12:13,225 --> 01:12:15,955
他摸过你吗?
Has he ever touched you before?

700
01:12:16,028 --> 01:12:19,089
你花五元就要谈过个吗?
Is this what you really want to talk
about for five bucks a dance, Thomas?

701
01:12:19,166 --> 01:12:23,364
我只想知道，你想他是怎么了
Well, I just want to know
what you think was going on in his mind.

702
01:12:23,436 --> 01:12:26,803
你是来开心理研究会吗?
Are you here for some kind
of psychology conference?

703
01:12:26,873 --> 01:12:30,706
嗯，喂，嗯，是的
Uh, well, uh, yes.

704
01:12:30,777 --> 01:12:33,541
是的，事实上我是
Uh, I am, actually.

705
01:12:33,612 --> 01:12:36,548
他是-
He's, uh-

706
01:12:36,616 --> 01:12:39,880
他是个很特别例子
He's a very particular case.

707
01:12:39,953 --> 01:12:43,217
怎样特别?
Particular in what way?

708
01:12:45,958 --> 01:12:50,225
你想知道全部经过?
Um...
you want the full story?

709
01:12:50,296 --> 01:12:54,597
当然
Sure.

710
01:12:59,305 --> 01:13:02,274
他女儿几年前被谋杀了
His daughter was murdered
a couple of years ago...

711
01:13:02,341 --> 01:13:05,903
他受到牵连
and then he was implicated.

712
01:13:05,978 --> 01:13:08,572
为那命案?
对
For th-the murder?
Yeah.

713
01:13:08,648 --> 01:13:13,915
为什么?
我不知道细节
But why?
I don't know. I don't really remember the details.

714
01:13:13,986 --> 01:13:17,080
后来他无罪获释真凶也被捕
I mean, he was cleared, and then
they caught the guy who did it.

715
01:13:17,157 --> 01:13:21,423
但此事显然
But... it obviously had,
like, this...

716
01:13:21,494 --> 01:13:23,428
对他造成极大影响
this incredible effect on him.

717
01:13:23,496 --> 01:13:26,762
我的意思是
I mean, he is-

718
01:13:26,832 --> 01:13:30,859
他被此事弄得不太正常
He's just so fucked up about it.

719
01:13:30,936 --> 01:13:32,870
哦
Oh.

720
01:13:35,108 --> 01:13:39,204
你知道
You know...

721
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:42,214
汤玛士
Thomas...

722
01:13:42,282 --> 01:13:46,946
佛兰西和我拥有极特殊的关系
Francis and I have
a very special type of relationship.

723
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:50,216
我并不介意
And I've never-
I've never minded.

724
01:13:50,290 --> 01:13:53,725
但他违反了规矩
But then he chose
to violate it.

725
01:13:53,792 --> 01:13:56,557
怎样特殊?
S-Special in what way?

726
01:14:02,302 --> 01:14:07,069
我们之间有谅解
Well, we've, we've always
had this understanding.

727
01:14:07,139 --> 01:14:10,234
我为某些事而需要他
I mean, I need him
for certain things...

728
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:13,244
他为某些事而需要我
and... he needs me
for certain things.

729
01:14:13,312 --> 01:14:15,746
就是如此
I mean, that's the way it's been.

730
01:14:15,814 --> 01:14:19,080
他如何违反规矩?
Uh, and how did he
violate that?

731
01:14:19,151 --> 01:14:24,919
他没做到他该为我演的角色
He-He violated that in his-his, in his
role and what he was supposed to do for me.

732
01:14:24,991 --> 01:14:27,482
他干了什么 为什么
Wh-What's he s... Why?

733
01:14:27,561 --> 01:14:30,792
他该为你作什么?
他来俱乐部他付钱给你了呀
What's he supposed to do for you? I
mean, he comes to this club. He pays you.

734
01:14:30,863 --> 01:14:34,697
因为我为他服务
Because I was
doing things for him...

735
01:14:34,767 --> 01:14:37,760
他为我作事
and he's done things for me.

736
01:14:41,107 --> 01:14:44,371
他为你作什么?
What has he done for you?

737
01:14:44,444 --> 01:14:47,378
我
I'm-

738
01:14:47,446 --> 01:14:50,882
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

739
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:56,013
对不起，这真蠢
Okay, this is really stupid.

740
01:14:56,089 --> 01:15:01,890
我为何因他摸我而激动
And then I'm getting so emotional
over the fact that he touched me...

741
01:15:01,962 --> 01:15:06,227
我因为他说付钱给我
because, I mean, he was,
he was always paying me...

742
01:15:06,299 --> 01:15:09,392
叫我帮忙
to do him this favor and-

743
01:15:09,468 --> 01:15:11,403
帮什么忙?
我不知道!
What favor?
I don't know, Thomas.

744
01:15:11,471 --> 01:15:15,407
你为何想知道?
我只是
Why do you want to know all this?
Well, I'm sorry, but I, uh-

745
01:15:15,475 --> 01:15:19,968
女学生为何能展现天真无邪?
What is it about a schoolgirl that gives
her that special innocence, gentlemen?

746
01:15:20,045 --> 01:15:24,072
那是你完全无法控制的
Such a thing that you have
absolutely no control over.

747
01:15:24,149 --> 01:15:27,744
以前没有
You never have.

748
01:15:27,821 --> 01:15:31,917
将来也不会
And you never will.

749
01:15:31,992 --> 01:15:35,188
请克莉汀娜出场
他不该那样做的
After this break, we'll be right back with sweet Chrissy...
He not supposed to do that.

750
01:15:35,262 --> 01:15:37,196
谁会帮我回答这个问题
做什么?
who'll help us answer that question.
Do what?

751
01:15:37,263 --> 01:15:39,197
他不该那样做
He's not supposed to-
He's not suppose-

752
01:15:39,265 --> 01:15:42,030
他从座位上可看到我和人谈话
He can obviously see from his booth that
I'm sitting here talking with a client.

753
01:15:42,101 --> 01:15:44,866
我和客人谈话时他不该叫我
He's not supposed to call me
when I'm talking with a client.

754
01:15:44,937 --> 01:15:48,873
你得走了吗?
Why? Do you have to go now?

755
01:15:50,276 --> 01:15:52,211
对
Uh, yeah.

756
01:15:52,279 --> 01:15:56,375
但我要回来再谈
But I want to come back,
and I want to, you know, talk.

757
01:15:56,448 --> 01:16:00,385
但我要到楼下，我不喜欢这儿
But I want to move downstairs.
I don't like it here.

758
01:16:00,453 --> 01:16:02,387
好，好
Sure, sure, sure.

759
01:16:02,455 --> 01:16:05,651
好，回头见
Okay. I'll see you soon.

760
01:16:12,465 --> 01:16:17,801
我得上厕所去
Uh, I'm going to move
to the washroom.

761
01:16:45,764 --> 01:16:50,702
我看到你和那女人一起蛮久的
Hey, I've noticed you've been spending
a lot of time with that lady.

762
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:53,204
你在和我说话?
Are youAre you talking to me?

763
01:16:53,273 --> 01:16:55,536
对
Yeah.

764
01:16:55,608 --> 01:16:59,942
你俩似乎一见如故
You seem, uh, to, to both
hit it off together.

765
01:17:00,013 --> 01:17:02,538
大概是
Well, I guess.
Yeah.

766
01:17:02,615 --> 01:17:04,775
大概是这样吧
Um, I guess
that can happen.

767
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:09,049
你们谈什么?
So what do you guys talk about?

768
01:17:09,121 --> 01:17:12,558
谈事情
Oh, just things.

769
01:17:12,625 --> 01:17:16,390
什么事情?
What sort of things?

770
01:17:16,463 --> 01:17:18,397
随便谈谈?
Oh, this and that.

771
01:17:18,465 --> 01:17:20,796
随便谈谈，呃?
"This and that," eh?

772
01:17:20,867 --> 01:17:24,894
真奇怪
You know, it's amazing how...

773
01:17:24,971 --> 01:17:29,498
人能一见如故，对吧?
you can hit it off with someone
like that, isn't it?

774
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:38,176
你可曾发现有人进入你生活
Have you ever noticed that
some people just drift into your life...

775
01:17:38,251 --> 01:17:42,051
就是好朋友一样?
like you've known them forever?

776
01:17:42,121 --> 01:17:45,023
有的人你能记得
I mean, there are some people
that you can remember...

777
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:49,858
一见就记得
the moment that you met them
really clearly.

778
01:17:49,928 --> 01:17:53,023
也有人
And other people that...

779
01:17:53,099 --> 01:17:58,867
刚见面就像多年老友
虽然其实没见过面
it seems like you've known them forever,
even though you haven't.

780
01:17:58,937 --> 01:18:03,705
他们成为你持续的记忆
And they all become part of this
continuous memory you have of yourself.

781
01:18:03,776 --> 01:18:07,542
这种持续
This ongoing-

782
01:18:07,613 --> 01:18:09,548
这你在听吗
Are you with me?

783
01:18:09,616 --> 01:18:13,211
对，我想是吧
Uh, yeah, I think so.

784
01:18:13,285 --> 01:18:15,219
我是说
I mean, here you are,
y-you know...

785
01:18:15,288 --> 01:18:17,552
你和她有段美妙的谈话
you're having this beautiful
conversation with her.

786
01:18:17,623 --> 01:18:22,721
你们开始了解对方
You're getting to know
each other, and-

787
01:18:22,795 --> 01:18:27,061
但还有别人来这儿
I mean, there's other guys
that come in here.

788
01:18:27,132 --> 01:18:31,001
有种人每隔几晚就来一次
There's this one guy who comes in here
every other night or something...

789
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:35,166
他跟她在一起数小时
and he spends
a few hours with her.

790
01:18:35,241 --> 01:18:37,675
但他从来未真正了解她
But he never really
gets to know her, you know?

791
01:18:37,744 --> 01:18:42,180
你没办法
你们俩没办法
Not the way you have.
Not the way you two-

792
01:18:45,584 --> 01:18:50,180
她和你在一起似乎较自在
She really seems
to be herself with you.

793
01:18:52,591 --> 01:18:55,526
你怎么知道?
Well, how do you know?

794
01:18:57,597 --> 01:19:00,360
她较自在?
What? That she's being herself?

795
01:19:00,433 --> 01:19:03,526
对
Yeah.

796
01:19:03,602 --> 01:19:08,540
因为我曾是她的爱人
Because I used to be her lover.

797
01:19:08,608 --> 01:19:12,373
对不起，我不能让你进去
I'm, uh, sorry, sir.
I can't let you in.

798
01:19:12,445 --> 01:19:14,878
为什么不能?
Look, why not?

799
01:19:16,448 --> 01:19:20,043
我能否和经理谈谈?
Look, can I... Can I at least
just talk to the manager?

800
01:19:20,119 --> 01:19:24,317
你要和经理谈?
对对
You want to talk to the manager?
Yeah.

801
01:19:24,389 --> 01:19:28,224
你得了解我们有严格的规定
You have to understand that
we have very strict rules...

802
01:19:28,293 --> 01:19:30,819
对于此类事情的反应
regarding
this sort of behavior here.

803
01:19:30,897 --> 01:19:34,492
我一直都很尊重
但这一次你没有
And I have always respected them.
And this one time you didn't.

804
01:19:34,567 --> 01:19:37,330
问题是这次
Now, the problem, Mr. Brown,
is that this one time...

805
01:19:37,403 --> 01:19:41,498
满屋子的人看着
happened in a room full
of other men who were watching.

806
01:19:41,573 --> 01:19:43,838
如果我让你回俱乐部去
Now, if I let you
back into the club...

807
01:19:43,909 --> 01:19:47,846
谁能阻止他们依样画葫芦?
我说过
what's to stop them from trying to do the same thing?
I told you.

808
01:19:47,914 --> 01:19:51,007
是有人叫我这样做的
我就做了
Someone told me to do it.
I was set up.

809
01:19:51,083 --> 01:19:55,679
你这么容易相信别人?
And you believed that someone?

810
01:19:55,754 --> 01:19:59,850
这是保安部门，请坐下
This is, uh, Security.
Please, sit down.

811
01:19:59,926 --> 01:20:01,859
谢谢
Thank you.

812
01:20:04,097 --> 01:20:07,532
你为何摸她?
Why did you touch her?

813
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,330
我想要弄清楚
为什么？
Well, I needed to make sure.
Why?

814
01:20:11,404 --> 01:20:14,429
如果她允许你呢?你会怎么做?
What if she let you?
What would you have done?

815
01:20:14,506 --> 01:20:17,032
我会很失望
I'd have been disappointed.

816
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:22,546
我不了解你的话
I'm not sure...
I understand you.

817
01:20:22,615 --> 01:20:25,982
那不是她被教导的方式
That's not the way
she was raised.

818
01:20:26,052 --> 01:20:28,611
你真的认识她?
You know her?
Personally?

819
01:20:30,622 --> 01:20:34,388
我可以介绍你去别的俱乐部
There is another club
I can recommend.

820
01:20:34,459 --> 01:20:36,552
我需要来此地
I need to come here.

821
01:20:36,628 --> 01:20:41,190
我非常了解
不，我想你不了解
I understand that very well.
No, I don't think you understand.

822
01:20:41,266 --> 01:20:44,896
这儿是个特别的地方
Exotica is a special place.

823
01:20:44,971 --> 01:20:49,567
我母亲当初是想创造特殊气氛
My mother was dedicated to creating
a very particular type of atmosphere...

824
01:20:49,641 --> 01:20:52,804
我想维持这一特点
and I would like
to maintain that.

825
01:20:52,878 --> 01:20:56,507
你不明白
You don't understand.

826
01:20:59,319 --> 01:21:04,552
布朗先生我们了解你的遭遇
Mr. Brown, we're all aware
of what you've gone through.

827
01:21:04,623 --> 01:21:07,421
你受了不少罪
You've suffered a lot.

828
01:21:07,493 --> 01:21:12,590
但你得了解此地系提供娱乐
But you have to understand
that Exotica is here for your amusement.

829
01:21:12,665 --> 01:21:16,192
我们提供娱乐，不是治疗
We're here to entertain,
not to heal.

830
01:21:16,269 --> 01:21:19,601
别的地方提供治疗
There are other places for that.

831
01:21:22,507 --> 01:21:24,442
其他地方?
Other places?

832
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:28,606
我可以给你份名单?
I can give you a list.

833
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,705
布朗先生?
Mr. Brown?

834
01:21:30,782 --> 01:21:32,841
你在听吗
布朗先生?
Are you listening to me,
Mr. Brown?

835
01:21:46,465 --> 01:21:49,230
嗯
Um...

836
01:21:49,302 --> 01:21:54,740
我刚在厕所见个家伙
um, I just met this man
in the washroom.

837
01:21:54,807 --> 01:21:56,741
什么人?
What man?

838
01:21:56,809 --> 01:21:58,743
我不知道，我在里面
Well, I'm not sure.
I was in a booth.

839
01:21:58,811 --> 01:22:01,244
我没机会看见他
I didn't really have
a chance to see him.

840
01:22:01,313 --> 01:22:05,409
你怎样遇见他的?
他开始跟我说话
So how did you meet him?
He just started talking to me.

841
01:22:05,484 --> 01:22:07,578
说什么?
And what did he say?

842
01:22:07,654 --> 01:22:12,590
他说他曾是你的爱人
Well, um, he said
he used to be your lover.

843
01:22:12,658 --> 01:22:15,889
这总是个悲伤的时刻
Well, it's always
a sad moment, gentlemen...

844
01:22:15,962 --> 01:22:20,921
时钟响后
when that clock
strikes that magic hour...

845
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:26,597
我们得送你返回夜里
and we have to send you out
into the long and dark and lonely night.

846
01:22:28,675 --> 01:22:32,042
但记住
But just remember...

847
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:36,548
我只有一梦之隔
we're only ever
just a dream away...

848
01:22:36,616 --> 01:22:39,379
无论在哪
wherever that is.

849
01:22:57,469 --> 01:23:00,405
我该走了
I guess-
I have to go.

850
01:23:01,974 --> 01:23:04,407
哦，好的
Oh, okay.

851
01:23:04,476 --> 01:23:07,071
好，等一下
Um, wait a minute.

852
01:23:07,146 --> 01:23:11,742
不，汤玛士不要
不…拜托
Oh, no. Thomas, don't.
No, no, no.

853
01:23:11,818 --> 01:23:16,584
不，汤玛士不要
不…拜托 我坚持!
Thomas, please, don't.
Uh... no, no. Uh, I insist.

854
01:23:16,656 --> 01:23:18,748
算了吧
Please.

855
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:22,252
谢谢你
Thank you.

856
01:23:30,802 --> 01:23:33,362
你爹说你
Your dad told me about, um...

857
01:23:33,438 --> 01:23:37,033
不想再当褓母
you not wanting
to baby-sit anymore.

858
01:23:37,109 --> 01:23:40,876
没有小孩看了
There's no baby to sit.

859
01:23:43,616 --> 01:23:47,381
我只要你知道我了解
Well, I just want you
to know, I understand.

860
01:23:47,453 --> 01:23:50,888
了解什么?
Understand what?

861
01:23:50,956 --> 01:23:55,325
这一切是有一点怪异
That this might all seem
a little weird.

862
01:23:55,394 --> 01:23:58,726
有一点?
A little?

863
01:24:00,132 --> 01:24:05,298
我们想谢谢你，崔西
为什么?
I just want to thank you, Tracey.
For what?

864
01:24:09,809 --> 01:24:12,903
你一直很有耐心
You've been very patient.

865
01:24:12,978 --> 01:24:16,415
还有
And, uh...

866
01:24:16,482 --> 01:24:20,918
你若认为时候到了我会了解
if you think the time has come
for this to end, then I understand.

867
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:31,528
谢谢你
Thank you.

868
01:24:31,597 --> 01:24:34,031
晚安，佛兰西
Good night, Francis.

869
01:24:54,654 --> 01:24:57,714
他从桌边叫我跳舞
你想想办法
He-He-He calls me from a table to dance.
Of course I expect you to do something.

870
01:24:57,790 --> 01:25:00,725
汀克莉娜
他跟着这家伙进厕所
Christina, And then,And then, he
follows this guy to the washroom...

871
01:25:00,792 --> 01:25:03,727
告诉这人他曾是我爱人
他曾经是
and he tells this guy that, that he was my lover.
Well, he was.

872
01:25:03,795 --> 01:25:06,560
太过分了，佐儿
It's going too far, Zoe.

873
01:25:06,631 --> 01:25:11,569
宝贝，你不知这有多过分
Actually, baby, you have
no idea how far it's gone.

874
01:25:11,637 --> 01:25:14,231
我叫他摸你
You know, I told him to touch you.

875
01:25:14,307 --> 01:25:18,107
我说你喜欢那样
I said you were into it. Yeah.

876
01:25:18,177 --> 01:25:23,580
以前看你为他起舞
看你使他感到安慰
It used to be wonderful watching you dance
for him, seeing how you could soothe him.

877
01:25:24,984 --> 01:25:27,918
我也高兴
I mean, it soothed me.

878
01:25:27,986 --> 01:25:31,184
你使我得到安慰
You know, you soothed me.

879
01:25:31,256 --> 01:25:33,247
懂吗?
Do you understand that?

880
01:25:36,596 --> 01:25:38,859
不，不要
Hey, hey.
Don't, don't, don't!

881
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:42,867
别碰，混旦
Stop. Stop that!
Don't fucking touch me, you fucker!

882
01:25:42,935 --> 01:25:45,529
住手,住手
不，滚开，佐儿
Stop!
Just fuck off, Zoe!

883
01:25:45,605 --> 01:25:49,199
停手，艾瑞克
Stop it when I say! Eric!
Stop it! Ow!

884
01:25:49,274 --> 01:25:51,208
冷静点
Chill out! Chill out!

885
01:25:51,276 --> 01:25:53,870
冷静点 放松
Chill out! Relax!

886
01:25:53,946 --> 01:25:56,540
好了 放松
艾瑞克，过来
All right? Relax!
Eric, come here!

887
01:25:56,616 --> 01:26:01,382
约翰，滚出去
怎样回事? 不
John! Get out. What's the matter?
No!

888
01:26:01,454 --> 01:26:04,718
滚开，佐儿！不
Fuck off, Zoe! No!

889
01:26:29,148 --> 01:26:32,082
早安，汤玛土
Morning, Thomas.

890
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:35,677
怎么回事?
我得走了
What happened?
I had to leave.

891
01:26:35,754 --> 01:26:38,314
你听到一切了吗?
Did you, uh, hear everything?

892
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:41,359
对
Yeah.

893
01:26:41,427 --> 01:26:44,021
你知道吗?
Did you know?

894
01:26:44,096 --> 01:26:46,188
我知道什么？
Did I know what?

895
01:26:46,264 --> 01:26:50,200
她知道你女儿的事?
That she knew...
about your daughter.

896
01:27:01,112 --> 01:27:05,550
警方侦讯我的
You know, when the,
when the police came to question me...

897
01:27:05,618 --> 01:27:09,384
告诉我许多事
they told me
a lot of things.

898
01:27:09,455 --> 01:27:13,891
他们说我妻和我弟有染
They told me that my wife
was having an affair with my brother;

899
01:27:13,959 --> 01:27:16,895
已经数年之久
had been for years.

900
01:27:16,963 --> 01:27:21,296
他们说我认为莉莎不是我女儿
They told me that I thought
Lisa wasn't my daughter.

901
01:27:22,968 --> 01:27:26,234
他们说我以为她是哈洛生的
They told me
I thought she was Harold's.

902
01:27:26,304 --> 01:27:28,363
他们为何那样说?
Wh-Why would they say that?

903
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:33,003
因为他们以为我会伤害她
Because they thought
I could harm her...

904
01:27:33,079 --> 01:27:37,846
我会伤害她
that I would harm her.

905
01:27:37,917 --> 01:27:43,685
后来他们找到真凶
And then they found the man
that, uh, that did it.

906
01:27:43,755 --> 01:27:47,522
才放了我
Let me go.

907
01:27:47,592 --> 01:27:51,688
我回到家中
And I went home.

908
01:27:54,433 --> 01:27:58,698
数月后我妻因车祸丧生
And then my wife was killed
in a car accident a couple months later.

909
01:27:58,771 --> 01:28:03,538
哈洛在车内
And, uh, Harold was in the car.

910
01:28:05,276 --> 01:28:08,337
他没死
He lived.

911
01:28:29,401 --> 01:28:31,494
你认为...
What do you think
it would have taken...

912
01:28:31,570 --> 01:28:35,005
你父亲怎样才会杀人?
for your father
to kill someone?

913
01:28:35,073 --> 01:28:39,840
我问这问题是因为我想杀个人
I'm asking because there's
someone that I want to kill now.

914
01:28:39,911 --> 01:28:45,350
我昨夜在厕所听到他声音
I felt it last night
as I listened to him in the washroom.

915
01:28:45,417 --> 01:28:47,511
我不懂
I don't understand.

916
01:28:47,586 --> 01:28:51,522
他陷害我，叫我摸她
He set me up...
to touch her.

917
01:28:51,590 --> 01:28:53,683
他为何那样做?
Why would he do that?

918
01:28:53,759 --> 01:28:58,355
他夺走了我拥有的特别事物
He took something
very special from me.

919
01:28:58,430 --> 01:29:02,526
我有许多的特别事物被人夺走
I've had too many
special things taken away.

920
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:07,538
所以我今晚必须回来
去杀他
That's why we have to go back tonight.
To kill him?

921
01:29:07,606 --> 01:29:10,699
你会怎么做，汤玛士?
What would you do, Thomas?
What would you do? Well-

922
01:29:10,775 --> 01:29:14,041
我会和他谈
我根本无法进去!
Well, I would talk to him.
I can't even get in there.

923
01:29:14,112 --> 01:29:17,048
你会怎样?
What would you do?

924
01:29:17,116 --> 01:29:20,552
今晚你回去
You go back tonight...

925
01:29:20,619 --> 01:29:23,213
你叫她为你跳舞
and you have her
dance for you...

926
01:29:23,289 --> 01:29:26,156
然后摸她
and then you touch her.

927
01:29:26,225 --> 01:29:28,887
他会把你像我一样扔出去
And he'll throw you out
just like he threw me out.

928
01:29:28,961 --> 01:29:31,485
但我会拿着枪在外面等他
But I'll be waiting outside
with the gun.

929
01:29:31,563 --> 01:29:34,590
我不要帮你杀人
I'm not gonna
help you kill somebody.

930
01:29:34,667 --> 01:29:37,932
不想少坐几年牢吗?
Not even to save
a few years in prison?

931
01:29:38,003 --> 01:29:40,233
不
No.

932
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:45,004
帮我的忙吧?
Well, to help me then?

933
01:29:50,249 --> 01:29:53,684
那是蜜拉，各位
And that was Mirella, gentlemen.
Mirella.

934
01:29:53,751 --> 01:29:57,187
你只要花五元她会陪你坐台
You can have her at your own table
for only five dollars.

935
01:29:57,256 --> 01:29:59,519
谢谢你，蜜拉
Thank you, Mirella.

936
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:06,856
很荣幸介绍下一位舞者
And now, it's always a pleasure
to announce to you our next dancer.

937
01:30:06,932 --> 01:30:11,028
各位，鼓掌吧
Gentlemen, please, let's give
a big round of applause...

938
01:30:11,102 --> 01:30:16,302
为克莉汀娜
for Christina.

939
01:33:44,115 --> 01:33:47,711
别害怕
Don't be afraid.

940
01:33:47,785 --> 01:33:50,311
我知道你的一切
I know everything about you.

941
01:33:50,388 --> 01:33:54,325
你知道些什么?
What do you know about me?

942
01:33:56,628 --> 01:34:00,358
我找到她
I found her.

943
01:34:00,432 --> 01:34:04,367
你找到谁?
You found who?

944
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:12,234
你的小女孩
Your little girl.

945
01:34:13,479 --> 01:34:16,414
噢 哦
Oh. Oh.

946
01:34:39,437 --> 01:34:41,633
我找到她了，老兄
I found her, man.

947
01:34:45,611 --> 01:34:47,544
我找到她了
I found her.

948
01:35:50,108 --> 01:35:54,044
奏些快乐的曲子
Yeah, play something happy.
Play something happy.

949
01:35:54,111 --> 01:35:56,079
 嗨
Yeah. Hello.

950
01:35:58,617 --> 01:36:01,050
喂?我去开
Okay, I'll get it,
I'll get it, I'll get it.

951
01:36:07,792 --> 01:36:10,227
嗨,汀克莉娜
Hi, Christina.
Hi.

952
01:36:10,294 --> 01:36:15,562
我来早了点
对，不要紧，进来
I'm a little bit early.
Yeah, th-that's okay. Come on in.

953
01:36:20,539 --> 01:36:23,064
我不知道
Yeah, I mean,
it's difficult for me to tell...

954
01:36:23,140 --> 01:36:25,905
我不太懂音乐
'cause I never had much
of a musical education myself...

955
01:36:25,977 --> 01:36:29,071
但她老师认为她有天赋
but her teacher thinks
she's really talented.

956
01:36:29,146 --> 01:36:33,173
我们想买架更好的钢琴给她
And, um, actually, we were thinking
of buying her a better piano.

957
01:36:33,251 --> 01:36:36,187
很特别的大婴儿
An exotic baby grand,
you know?

958
01:36:36,254 --> 01:36:38,519
我说大婴儿后她怎么说?
And when I mentioned "baby grand,"
do you know what she said to me?

959
01:36:38,590 --> 01:36:43,026
她说爹那不是自相矛盾吗?
She said, "Dad,
isn't that a contradiction in terms?"

960
01:36:43,095 --> 01:36:45,858
她一再使我感到惊奇
I mean, she just never
ceases to amaze me.

961
01:36:45,930 --> 01:36:47,865
她才八岁，你相信吗?
I mean, she's eight years old.
Can you imagine?

962
01:36:47,932 --> 01:36:50,629
她已经认识，你叫什么?
She can already identify-
Wh-What do you call that when...

963
01:36:50,702 --> 01:36:54,035
名有两个
要说哪个？
it's two words,
kind of cancel each other out?

964
01:36:54,106 --> 01:36:58,372
我感到惊奇
Oh, she just amazes me.

965
01:37:00,445 --> 01:37:05,211
你在想什么?
Where's your mind?

966
01:37:05,283 --> 01:37:08,720
我只是在想
I was just thinking.

967
01:37:08,787 --> 01:37:12,052
想什么?
About what?

968
01:37:12,124 --> 01:37:16,220
你谈论莉莎的方式
About the way
you talk about Lisa.

969
01:37:16,294 --> 01:37:18,888
你变得好兴奋
You get so excited.

970
01:37:18,963 --> 01:37:22,899
真好
It's nice.

971
01:37:24,303 --> 01:37:28,033
我想你父母也会这样谈论你
Well, I'm sure your parents
talk about you that way too.

972
01:37:28,106 --> 01:37:31,166
我不以为然
I don't think so.

973
01:37:31,242 --> 01:37:35,008
我想会的
Oh, I do.

974
01:37:35,079 --> 01:37:37,173
为什么?
Why?

975
01:37:37,249 --> 01:37:41,515
因为你是负责的少女
Because you're a very
responsible young woman.

976
01:37:41,586 --> 01:37:46,024
向什么负责?
Responsible to what?

977
01:37:46,091 --> 01:37:50,858
向你相信你该做的事
Well, to whatever it is
you believe you have to do.

978
01:37:50,928 --> 01:37:55,024
例如什么?
Like what?

979
01:37:55,099 --> 01:38:00,936
莉莎很喜欢你作她褓母
Well, Lisa loves it when you
come over to baby-sit, for example.

980
01:38:03,108 --> 01:38:06,874
她说你真会听她的话
She says you really
listen to her.

981
01:38:06,945 --> 01:38:09,879
很好
That's nice.

982
01:38:09,948 --> 01:38:12,644
她也听我说的话
She really listens
to me too.

983
01:38:18,624 --> 01:38:21,684
她认为你不快乐
She thinks you're not very happy.

984
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:27,220
听我说，克莉汀娜
Listen, Christina,

985
01:38:27,298 --> 01:38:31,497
如果你有事情想要谈一谈
if there's, if there's ever anything
you want to talk about...

986
01:38:31,570 --> 01:38:35,097
谈家里什么的事
about what might be going on
at home or whatever...

987
01:38:35,173 --> 01:38:40,008
我愿意倾听，好吗?
you know that I'm here, okay?

988
01:38:41,912 --> 01:38:44,506
好的
好吗?
Okay.
Okay?

989
01:38:44,582 --> 01:38:46,675
好的
Okay.

990
01:38:51,923 --> 01:38:55,517
好的
Okay.

991
01:39:00,765 --> 01:39:03,997
不，不要紧
Oh, no.
It's okay.

992
01:39:07,104 --> 01:39:09,198
谢谢你
Thank you.

993
01:39:16,615 --> 01:39:20,142
我真喜欢你送我回家
You know, I really enjoy
these drives home, Mr. Brown.

994
01:39:20,218 --> 01:39:23,709
好，我也是
Good, good.
So do I.

995
01:39:26,791 --> 01:39:29,658
再见，布朗先生
Bye, Mr. Brown.
Good-bye.
