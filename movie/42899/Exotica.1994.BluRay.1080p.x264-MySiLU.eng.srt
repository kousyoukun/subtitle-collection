1
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:09,120
You have to ask yourself...

2
00:02:09,192 --> 00:02:12,787
what brought the person
to this point.

3
00:02:12,862 --> 00:02:18,357
What was seen in his face,
his manner, that channeled him here.

4
00:02:18,434 --> 00:02:21,494
You have
to convince yourself...

5
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:26,838
that this person has something hidden
that you have to find.

6
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:32,006
You check his bags,
but it's his face...

7
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:35,847
his gestures that
you're really watching.

8
00:02:38,788 --> 00:02:40,813
Thank you.

9
00:02:58,841 --> 00:03:01,275
He's staring straight at you.

10
00:03:01,344 --> 00:03:04,108
Look at him, carefully.

11
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,478
What do you see?

12
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:10,849
Security 4 to Baggage Claim 17.

13
00:03:22,064 --> 00:03:24,965
Where you headed?
Uh, downtown.

14
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,465
You want to split it?
S-Sure.

15
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:47,587
What? Not tonight.
Are you sure?

16
00:03:47,657 --> 00:03:49,955
Well, can't you cancel?

17
00:04:02,071 --> 00:04:06,838
Oh. Uh... what are these?

18
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:09,571
Ballet tickets for tonight.

19
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:12,512
Oh.

20
00:04:12,582 --> 00:04:17,451
You don't like ballet?
Well, some ballets.

21
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,250
Well, that's exactly
what this is: some ballet.

22
00:04:20,323 --> 00:04:23,258
Look, you can always scalp
the tickets at the door.

23
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:26,454
Oh, you mean, uh,
take these in exchange...

24
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:30,590
for you paying your part of the fare.
Well, what do you think?

25
00:04:51,654 --> 00:04:53,918
See ya, John.
Good night, John.

26
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,924
See you guys.
See ya.

27
00:05:18,681 --> 00:05:21,275
Christina, here you are.
Hurry and get dressed.

28
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,443
People are asking for you.

29
00:05:47,977 --> 00:05:50,912
She's right over there. I'll get her.

30
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,005
Bye.

31
00:05:57,653 --> 00:06:02,113
Yeah!

32
00:06:02,191 --> 00:06:04,421
Let's bring those big, hairy
palms together, gentlemen...

33
00:06:04,493 --> 00:06:06,688
and have a nice,
big round of applause...

34
00:06:06,762 --> 00:06:09,094
for Kali!

35
00:06:09,165 --> 00:06:11,099
Kali.

36
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:13,101
Yes, indeed. Kali.

37
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:15,933
And you, too, can you, too,
can have Kali come over to your table...

38
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:19,771
for only five dollars, where she can
show you the mysteries of her world.

39
00:06:19,842 --> 00:06:24,506
Trust me, gentlemen. Trust me.

40
00:07:11,227 --> 00:07:13,752
Oh! Baby, baby, baby!

41
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:18,926
Ooh! Do it for me, baby!

42
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:24,769
Oh! My God, that's incredible.
That's incredible.

43
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,274
Let me ask you something,
gentlemen.

44
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:31,439
What is it that gives a schoolgirl
her special innocence?

45
00:07:31,514 --> 00:07:37,282
Her sweet fragrance? Fresh flowers...
light as a spring rain?

46
00:07:37,353 --> 00:07:39,787
Oh, my God.
My God.

47
00:07:39,855 --> 00:07:42,449
Or is it her firm, young flesh
inviting your every caress...

48
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:44,959
enticing you to explore...

49
00:07:45,027 --> 00:07:50,260
her deepest
and most private secrets?

50
00:07:50,332 --> 00:07:55,395
Well, gentlemen, I'm gonna let you
decide that one for yourselves.

51
00:07:55,471 --> 00:07:58,736
Please join me
in welcoming a sassy...

52
00:07:58,808 --> 00:08:02,744
bit of jailbait
to our stage.

53
00:08:02,812 --> 00:08:07,249
Yes, indeed.

54
00:08:07,316 --> 00:08:10,080
Come out, sweet Chrissy.

55
00:08:10,152 --> 00:08:12,746
Wherever you are, baby,
come on out.

56
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:33,932
You think you're bad, eh, baby?

57
00:09:35,503 --> 00:09:37,302
You're bad.

58
00:09:53,055 --> 00:09:57,458
That will be $5.50.

59
00:10:03,063 --> 00:10:06,130
Thank you.

60
00:11:34,223 --> 00:11:37,715
Eric?
What?

61
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:42,162
Linda finished her dance.

62
00:11:42,231 --> 00:11:45,997
Let's bring those big, hairy
palms together, gentlemen.

63
00:11:46,068 --> 00:11:50,164
Give it up. Yeah, gentlemen. Yes.

64
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:55,575
Have a nice, big round
of applause for Linda. Yeah.

65
00:11:55,644 --> 00:11:58,545
Yes, indeed, Linda.

66
00:11:58,614 --> 00:12:00,844
And just a reminder that there is
nothing Linda would love more...

67
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,282
than to slink over
to your table and...

68
00:12:03,352 --> 00:12:07,618
give you your own private show
for only five dollars.

69
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,624
That's right.

70
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:13,753
Five dollars is all it takes
to have one of our beautiful foxes...

71
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:17,128
come over to your table
and get you all hot and bothered.

72
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:19,963
But, hey, why be bothered...

73
00:12:20,035 --> 00:12:24,301
when you're being treated
like a king?

74
00:12:24,373 --> 00:12:28,969
You've had a rough day.

75
00:12:29,044 --> 00:12:32,275
Don't you think you owe it
to yourselves to...

76
00:12:32,348 --> 00:12:36,182
do something that'll make you feel
like you're someone special?

77
00:12:38,253 --> 00:12:42,587
You are someone special.

78
00:12:42,658 --> 00:12:47,118
Five dollars is all
it takes to prove it.

79
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,737
Yes, let's have a nice big round
of applause for Michelle.

80
00:13:31,807 --> 00:13:34,970
My God, that was beautiful.

81
00:13:37,012 --> 00:13:39,503
Ooh, baby, you come out.

82
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:43,017
And just to remind you that, uh, there's
nothing Michelle would love more...

83
00:13:43,085 --> 00:13:45,349
than to come over to your table
and give you your own private dance.

84
00:13:47,756 --> 00:13:50,748
Hello, gentlemen!

85
00:13:50,826 --> 00:13:52,760
Anybody out there?
Anybody alive?

86
00:13:52,828 --> 00:13:55,626
Anybody, for five dollars,
you can have Kali.

87
00:13:55,697 --> 00:13:59,827
Kali at your own private table.

88
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,774
Let me ask you something,
gentlemen.

89
00:14:06,842 --> 00:14:09,072
What is it
about a schoolgirl...

90
00:14:09,144 --> 00:14:12,602
that gives her that
special innocence?

91
00:14:16,185 --> 00:14:18,813
Is it the way that
they can gaze at you...

92
00:14:18,887 --> 00:14:22,948
waiting for you to say something
with so much expectation and hope...

93
00:14:23,025 --> 00:14:27,621
that you're just...
you're just paralyzed into...

94
00:14:29,331 --> 00:14:32,698
into silence?

95
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:27,078
Look, uh, I want to give this back to you.
Why?

96
00:15:27,156 --> 00:15:29,920
Well, you see,
those tickets were given to me...

97
00:15:29,992 --> 00:15:34,759
and, uh, I just feel uncomfortable
about having sold them.

98
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,799
That's okay.
No, no, no, really, I-

99
00:15:42,204 --> 00:15:45,139
We never really introduced ourselves.
I'm Thomas.

100
00:15:45,207 --> 00:15:47,141
David.

101
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:49,575
Can I use this
to take you out for a drink?

102
00:15:49,645 --> 00:15:54,514
Oh, that's, uh, very kind
of you, but, uh. But what?

103
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:58,417
But I really have
to get home.

104
00:16:39,194 --> 00:16:41,389
Thanks.

105
00:16:41,463 --> 00:16:43,397
Are you available
next Thursday?

106
00:16:43,465 --> 00:16:45,456
Uh, I think so, yeah.
Good, good.

107
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:50,235
Tracey?
Yeah?

108
00:16:50,305 --> 00:16:52,569
I'm not that boring, am I?

109
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:56,577
What do you mean?
Well, the earphones.

110
00:16:56,645 --> 00:16:59,341
I mean, we used to listen
to the radio...

111
00:16:59,414 --> 00:17:03,373
and you used to ask me
all sorts of questions.

112
00:17:03,452 --> 00:17:06,148
So you want me
to ask more questions?

113
00:17:07,823 --> 00:17:11,520
Sure. Yeah, I mean, if there's
something y-you want to know.

114
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:15,092
Okay. I'll see
what I can think up.

115
00:17:15,163 --> 00:17:17,188
Say hi to your dad.
I will.

116
00:17:17,266 --> 00:17:19,200
Good night.
Good night.

117
00:17:39,688 --> 00:17:43,556
Did someone say something?
No.

118
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,820
So, what's the point?

119
00:17:45,894 --> 00:17:49,227
I've just noticed
a change in your attitude.

120
00:17:53,302 --> 00:17:56,863
Look, I would understand if you would
prefer not to introduce Christina.

121
00:17:56,938 --> 00:18:01,375
I could do it myself.

122
00:18:01,443 --> 00:18:03,775
Actually, I've been thinking
that, perhaps...

123
00:18:03,845 --> 00:18:08,179
I should be getting more involved
in the introductions overall.

124
00:18:10,252 --> 00:18:13,483
I could have my own microphone,
like my mother used to do.

125
00:18:13,555 --> 00:18:16,854
No, I mean, I actually
enjoy introducing Christina.

126
00:18:16,925 --> 00:18:19,553
I mean, I find it
very therapeutic, you know?

127
00:18:19,628 --> 00:18:23,689
That's not what you're getting paid for.
Well, it seems to me...

128
00:18:23,765 --> 00:18:27,997
that I'm being paid to make every girl
seem like she's something special, right?

129
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:33,269
So, in order to do that,
I have to let my imagination run wild.

130
00:18:35,344 --> 00:18:38,905
So, I mean, when it comes
to Christina, I, you know-

131
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,676
My imagination is bound
to run a little wilder.

132
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,480
There's nothing that I can do
to control that, Zoe.

133
00:18:44,553 --> 00:18:47,215
Makes the clients uncomfortable.

134
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:49,985
And you think your state
puts them at ease?

135
00:18:59,735 --> 00:19:01,669
Hey.

136
00:19:03,338 --> 00:19:05,568
Is he kicking?

137
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,077
All the time.

138
00:19:13,281 --> 00:19:15,476
Do you feel like touching it?

139
00:19:27,396 --> 00:19:29,330
Oh.

140
00:19:36,505 --> 00:19:40,839
How are you feeling about this?

141
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:44,436
Fine.
Fine?

142
00:19:44,513 --> 00:19:47,141
Are you happy?

143
00:19:47,215 --> 00:19:49,342
For you.

144
00:19:52,254 --> 00:19:55,451
What about you, Eric?
What about you?

145
00:19:57,392 --> 00:19:59,917
Well, I guess I got to be pretty careful
about my feelings, right?

146
00:19:59,995 --> 00:20:03,328
I mean, uh...

147
00:20:03,398 --> 00:20:07,459
that's why we have
a contract, isn't it?

148
00:20:12,974 --> 00:20:15,568
There's plaster dust
all over the apartment.

149
00:20:15,644 --> 00:20:19,478
No, I'm not exaggerating. No, I was
coughing in my sleep last night.

150
00:20:19,548 --> 00:20:22,642
You told me that it was going to be
comfortable for me to live there...

151
00:20:22,717 --> 00:20:24,810
and it is not comfortable.

152
00:20:24,886 --> 00:20:26,820
There's plastic on the furniture.

153
00:20:26,888 --> 00:20:29,982
That is not comfortable living.

154
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:33,118
Yeah. Oh, come on, look.

155
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:37,359
You told me you were going to strip
the wallpaper, not strip the walls down.

156
00:20:37,432 --> 00:20:40,367
Well, no, if you'd,
if you'd told me in the first place-

157
00:20:40,435 --> 00:20:42,926
If you'd told me what kind of job
it was, then I would have considered it.

158
00:20:43,004 --> 00:20:47,338
Although, it's it makes me seem
like you've maybe made a mistake.

159
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:50,503
That's what it makes me suspect.

160
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,513
What? No, it's too late now.
It's inaccessible.

161
00:20:55,584 --> 00:20:58,553
I'm not gonna pay you. Pay you for what?
You didn't do the job.

162
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,818
Well, you did a job, but it's not
the job that I asked you to do.

163
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:05,655
It's not the job
we agreed on.

164
00:21:05,727 --> 00:21:08,958
Well, I can get anyone,
any number of people to do this.

165
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:13,023
Yeah, that's just fine with me.

166
00:21:16,605 --> 00:21:19,802
Yeah, can I help you?

167
00:21:21,243 --> 00:21:23,336
Mr. Pinto?
Uh, yes.

168
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:27,044
I'm Francis Brown. We spoke, uh,
on the phone a couple of weeks ago.

169
00:21:28,283 --> 00:21:32,811
Revenue Canada.
Oh, uh, of course. Uh-

170
00:21:32,888 --> 00:21:36,949
How was your trip?
Oh, it was fine.

171
00:21:37,025 --> 00:21:40,358
And when did you get back?
Um, just yesterday.

172
00:21:40,428 --> 00:21:43,363
Good weather?

173
00:21:43,431 --> 00:21:46,992
Yes, yes, lovely. Yeah.

174
00:21:47,068 --> 00:21:49,901
Is this a good time, Mr. Pinto?
Oh, sure.

175
00:21:49,971 --> 00:21:54,465
It's just that you seem a
little, uh£¬A little what?

176
00:21:54,543 --> 00:21:57,137
Flustered.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

177
00:21:57,212 --> 00:21:59,976
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

178
00:22:00,048 --> 00:22:01,982
Good.

179
00:22:07,656 --> 00:22:11,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen,
I can't talk to you right now. L-Later.

180
00:22:23,738 --> 00:22:26,138
Okay, uh-

181
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,392
So this is where I'd find
all the bank s-statements? Uh-

182
00:22:46,461 --> 00:22:49,726
Yeah, that's right,
and those there.

183
00:22:53,168 --> 00:22:56,433
Okay. Well, if I have any questions,
I'll let you know.

184
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,533
Is it a little hot for you back here?
It's, uh, yeah.

185
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:04,841
You could turn it down a tad.

186
00:23:04,913 --> 00:23:10,442
I suppose you have to be pretty careful
with the temperature with the animals.

187
00:23:10,518 --> 00:23:13,112
Oh, well, they're a lot hardier
than you'd think.

188
00:23:15,857 --> 00:23:18,792
I wouldn't think
they're not hardy.

189
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:24,628
I mean, just because they're exotic
doesn't mean they can't endure extremes.

190
00:23:24,699 --> 00:23:28,795
It is, after all,
a jungle out there, isn't it?

191
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,705
Um, so, how long
will this take?

192
00:23:35,777 --> 00:23:38,940
An audit?
Yes.

193
00:23:39,014 --> 00:23:42,177
Well, it depends on
how prepared you are.

194
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:47,244
Have you got an accountant? Uh,
well, um, no. Well, no, not really, no.

195
00:23:47,322 --> 00:23:50,314
Not really?

196
00:23:50,392 --> 00:23:53,919
So this will take, uh, a while?
I could be done by the end of the day.

197
00:23:53,995 --> 00:23:57,658
Or it might take a week.
It's difficult to say.

198
00:23:57,732 --> 00:24:03,227
Oh. Okay. Uh, well, if you have any
questions, um, I'll let you know.

199
00:24:40,175 --> 00:24:42,609
Did you know her?

200
00:24:44,112 --> 00:24:46,945
Sort of.

201
00:24:47,015 --> 00:24:50,473
She was your neighbor?

202
00:24:50,552 --> 00:24:54,215
I, uh, I baby-sat her
a couple times.

203
00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:58,248
Oh, so you knew her
pretty well, eh?

204
00:24:58,326 --> 00:25:01,762
Yeah. I did.

205
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,764
What about you?

206
00:25:03,832 --> 00:25:09,202
Oh, I just, uh, I heard this thing
was being organized, so-

207
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,262
It seems so, uh...

208
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,104
surreal, doesn't it?

209
00:25:15,176 --> 00:25:18,612
What?
That we'd find anything.

210
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:24,277
I mean, there's so, uh, many places you
could hide something in this country.

211
00:25:24,352 --> 00:25:29,119
My name's Eric.
I'm Christina.

212
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:32,159
Hey, nice to meet you,
Christina.

213
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,139
Well?

214
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:52,771
Well, what?
Don't you want to touch it?

215
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:59,712
You don't have to. It's one of
those things people normally like to do.

216
00:25:59,788 --> 00:26:02,518
Ah.

217
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,729
What is this thing about Eric
calling you "a sassy piece of jailbait"?

218
00:26:17,806 --> 00:26:21,401
What's this thing?
It bothers me.

219
00:26:21,476 --> 00:26:24,843
Why?
It makes you out like a child or something.

220
00:26:24,913 --> 00:26:30,146
Unlike the tartan skirt and my socks
or the blouse or the way I act, right?

221
00:26:33,321 --> 00:26:37,655
Do you find it strange that he
would still want to work here?

222
00:26:37,725 --> 00:26:43,322
Zoe, not all of us have the luxury
of deciding what to do with our lives.

223
00:26:43,398 --> 00:26:46,492
It's a job, and he's
getting paid all right.

224
00:26:46,568 --> 00:26:49,128
I just find it cruel.

225
00:26:49,204 --> 00:26:51,764
So fire him.

226
00:26:53,575 --> 00:26:56,738
As a favor.

227
00:26:56,811 --> 00:26:59,746
How can you be so detached?

228
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:39,371
Well, I'm finished for the day.

229
00:28:39,447 --> 00:28:43,645
Uh, for the day?
Uh, you mean you have to come back?

230
00:28:43,718 --> 00:28:46,585
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

231
00:28:46,654 --> 00:28:48,918
When is a good time?

232
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,458
But, but, I thought you said
it was only going to take one day.

233
00:28:51,526 --> 00:28:54,256
Well, it can only take a day.

234
00:28:54,329 --> 00:28:58,163
But you have to understand, you don't
keep very well-organized books.

235
00:28:58,232 --> 00:29:00,723
That's why you should really think
about getting someone in to help you.

236
00:29:00,802 --> 00:29:03,999
Just somebody to come in
once or twice a week...

237
00:29:04,072 --> 00:29:09,977
depending on the amount of activity
and... the type of activity.

238
00:29:10,044 --> 00:29:13,036
Uh, what do you mean by that?

239
00:29:13,114 --> 00:29:16,277
Well, some types of activity
are more complicated, aren't they?

240
00:29:16,351 --> 00:29:19,320
It might take more effort
to account for.

241
00:29:19,387 --> 00:29:21,321
Oh.

242
00:29:21,389 --> 00:29:24,415
I found a gun
in one of the drawers.

243
00:29:24,492 --> 00:29:29,896
Oh, well, that belonged to my dad.
Your dad?

244
00:29:29,964 --> 00:29:34,196
Yeah, I guess he just kept it,
uh, just in case.

245
00:29:34,268 --> 00:29:39,035
In case of what?
Well, in case of trouble.

246
00:29:39,107 --> 00:29:41,405
With the animals?

247
00:29:45,313 --> 00:29:47,941
Would Monday be a good time
for me to come back...

248
00:29:48,016 --> 00:29:51,508
Mr. Pinto?
Oh, yeah.

249
00:29:51,586 --> 00:29:53,611
Well, how about, uh, tomorrow?

250
00:29:53,688 --> 00:29:57,920
Uh, I have appointments for tomorrow.
Actually, I'm pretty busy 'til the end of the week.

251
00:29:57,992 --> 00:30:00,051
Monday's not good?

252
00:30:00,128 --> 00:30:02,756
No, uh, Monday's fine.

253
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:05,196
Around 10:00?
Yeah, sure.

254
00:30:08,102 --> 00:30:10,730
Well, good.
Have a nice weekend.

255
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,367
Strange to think that bird
is probably going to outlive us.

256
00:30:42,437 --> 00:30:45,804
Strange?

257
00:30:45,873 --> 00:30:49,104
Did you ever teach it
to say anything?

258
00:30:49,177 --> 00:30:51,111
Yes.

259
00:30:54,248 --> 00:30:58,981
What does it say, Harold?
It doesn't really say it anymore.

260
00:30:59,053 --> 00:31:00,953
It forgot?

261
00:31:02,723 --> 00:31:07,717
I don't think so.
They're not supposed to forget.

262
00:31:07,795 --> 00:31:10,730
It must have just lost interest.

263
00:31:13,734 --> 00:31:17,465
I'm sorry I'm late.
It's okay. We're just talking about Felix.

264
00:31:17,538 --> 00:31:19,904
What about him?

265
00:31:19,974 --> 00:31:22,306
Dad?

266
00:31:22,376 --> 00:31:27,177
I had the piano tuned.
It sounds beautiful.

267
00:31:53,207 --> 00:31:55,641
So, how does it sound?

268
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:58,474
It's good.
Yeah? Good, good.

269
00:31:58,546 --> 00:32:01,982
Okay, well, I shouldn't be too late.
What's "too late"?

270
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:05,485
Around 11:00 or so?
Okay.

271
00:32:37,752 --> 00:32:41,017
You looking for tickets?

272
00:32:41,088 --> 00:32:43,784
Uh, yeah. How much?

273
00:33:50,024 --> 00:33:53,118
That's too hot.

274
00:34:15,116 --> 00:34:18,483
He comes in here every other night.

275
00:34:19,053 --> 00:34:22,819
He has his favorite drink...

276
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:27,486
at his favorite table
with his favorite dancer.

277
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:34,998
Sometimes he has to wait for her,
and sometimes she's waiting for him.

278
00:34:35,069 --> 00:34:39,506
She'll protect him.
She's his angel.

279
00:34:46,013 --> 00:34:50,109
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
it's show time at the Exotica.

280
00:34:50,184 --> 00:34:52,778
And just to remind you
that five dollars is all it takes...

281
00:34:52,853 --> 00:34:57,449
to have one of our lovely ladies
come over to your table...

282
00:34:57,525 --> 00:35:02,462
and show you the mysteries
of their world.

283
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:20,773
Now if that didn't
turn you on, gentlemen, nothing will.

284
00:36:20,841 --> 00:36:26,473
Oh, let's have a nice, big, warm round
of applause for Christina, gentlemen!

285
00:36:26,547 --> 00:36:28,947
Yes, Christina!

286
00:36:51,172 --> 00:36:55,268
What are you thinking?

287
00:36:55,342 --> 00:36:59,779
I was just thinking,
what would happen if someone hurt you?

288
00:37:03,184 --> 00:37:07,450
H-How could anyone hurt me?

289
00:37:07,521 --> 00:37:12,618
If I'm not there
to protect you.

290
00:37:15,029 --> 00:37:20,490
You'll always
be there to protect me.

291
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:51,423
An angel.

292
00:37:51,499 --> 00:37:54,434
Shh.

293
00:37:59,173 --> 00:38:03,439
Why would somebody want
to do something like that?

294
00:38:05,179 --> 00:38:10,617
How could somebody even think
of doing something like that?

295
00:38:10,684 --> 00:38:14,620
You mustn't worry.

296
00:38:30,371 --> 00:38:33,465
Eric! Eric!

297
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,805
Oh.

298
00:38:35,876 --> 00:38:41,610
All hot and bothered, yes, indeed.

299
00:38:41,682 --> 00:38:47,143
Let's have a nice, big
round of applause for Melinda.

300
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:45,645
Uh, listen, I feel bad about,
uh, taking your money.

301
00:39:45,713 --> 00:39:50,150
Why?
The tickets were given to me, and...

302
00:39:50,217 --> 00:39:53,152
I should have
given them away for free.

303
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,314
Well, that would have been stupid.
Why?

304
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,154
Because no one
gives anything away.

305
00:40:00,728 --> 00:40:04,596
Are you sure?
Yeah, p-positive.

306
00:40:28,255 --> 00:40:32,191
Do you consider my dad a friend?

307
00:40:32,259 --> 00:40:35,626
Why?
J-Just asking.

308
00:40:35,696 --> 00:40:38,529
Does he consider me a friend?

309
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:41,534
I don't know.

310
00:40:41,602 --> 00:40:43,695
Why not?

311
00:40:43,771 --> 00:40:47,639
'Cause he always seems
different when you're around.

312
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:52,042
Different in what way?
Tense.

313
00:40:54,381 --> 00:40:56,315
Is that bad?

314
00:40:56,383 --> 00:41:00,649
Well, I don't really like
to feel tense around my friends.

315
00:41:00,721 --> 00:41:02,985
Well, sure, yeah.

316
00:41:03,057 --> 00:41:06,288
I didn't like to feel tense around
my friends when I was your age either.

317
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,659
But you do now?

318
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:13,291
No, it's not a question
of liking it or not.

319
00:41:13,367 --> 00:41:16,996
It's just something that happens.

320
00:41:17,071 --> 00:41:19,335
Why?

321
00:41:20,908 --> 00:41:25,504
Um...

322
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:30,175
well... as you get older...

323
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:35,187
you become aware that the people
you meet and the person you are...

324
00:41:35,255 --> 00:41:39,453
um, as carrying
a certain amount of baggage.

325
00:41:39,526 --> 00:41:44,190
And, and that baggage
creates tension.

326
00:41:44,264 --> 00:41:47,631
So what do you do about it?

327
00:41:47,701 --> 00:41:50,329
Well, you can pretend
it's not there...

328
00:41:50,404 --> 00:41:54,135
or you can choose
not to have friends...

329
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:58,542
or you can acknowledge that
it's there and have friends anyway.

330
00:41:58,612 --> 00:42:00,978
Like my dad?

331
00:42:02,483 --> 00:42:04,815
Right.

332
00:42:04,885 --> 00:42:09,117
I don't think that I like my dad
when he's around you.

333
00:42:11,725 --> 00:42:15,320
Hmm.

334
00:42:15,395 --> 00:42:17,488
Well, that's...

335
00:42:17,564 --> 00:42:22,160
because your dad doesn't like himself
when he's around me.

336
00:42:22,236 --> 00:42:24,170
But that's okay.

337
00:42:24,238 --> 00:42:28,106
That's... part of what friends do
to each other.

338
00:42:32,746 --> 00:42:34,839
Good night.
Good night.

339
00:43:02,609 --> 00:43:04,634
I, uh-
I just graduated.

340
00:43:04,711 --> 00:43:06,645
Really?
So did I.

341
00:43:06,713 --> 00:43:10,649
Oh, yeah? In what?
Radio communications.

342
00:43:10,717 --> 00:43:14,312
So, so is that what you do?
That's what I'd like to do.

343
00:43:14,388 --> 00:43:17,653
Uh, I do a little
freelance deejay stuff...

344
00:43:17,724 --> 00:43:20,818
but, you know, right now
I'm just driving a cab.

345
00:43:20,894 --> 00:43:24,660
I thought you might do something like that.
Drive a cab?

346
00:43:24,731 --> 00:43:29,668
No, do something where, you use your voice.
Why?

347
00:43:29,736 --> 00:43:34,605
I don't know why.
Because you're easy to listen to.

348
00:43:34,675 --> 00:43:38,167
Because of my voice, eh?

349
00:43:56,697 --> 00:44:00,793
I just need to find
a structure, you know?

350
00:44:00,868 --> 00:44:02,802
What do you mean?

351
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:07,466
Listen, I waste so much time, you know?
I just My days just slip by, you know?

352
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:11,671
Isn't that what days are supposed to do?
Yeah.

353
00:44:11,745 --> 00:44:15,146
Not if you want to make
something of yourself, you know?

354
00:44:15,215 --> 00:44:19,311
What do you
want to make of yourself?

355
00:44:19,386 --> 00:44:23,823
I don't know. I just feel that I was
meant to do something with my time.

356
00:44:23,891 --> 00:44:28,658
I mean, otherwise, I wouldn't be
thinking of this this way.

357
00:44:28,729 --> 00:44:32,995
I'd be able to just
continue what I was doing, you know?

358
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,007
Do you have a lot of friends?

359
00:44:46,813 --> 00:44:50,749
Not really. Do you?

360
00:44:50,817 --> 00:44:54,116
No.
Yeah.

361
00:44:54,187 --> 00:44:59,420
Do you ever feel like you need a friend?

362
00:44:59,493 --> 00:45:02,951
Yeah, sometimes.

363
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:06,090
When?

364
00:45:06,166 --> 00:45:08,760
Like right now.

365
00:45:08,835 --> 00:45:11,599
Why?

366
00:45:11,672 --> 00:45:14,766
'Cause I just met you and...

367
00:45:14,841 --> 00:45:18,277
I just feel like
telling someone, you know?

368
00:45:58,485 --> 00:46:02,581
No way.
No way, no way.

369
00:46:05,325 --> 00:46:07,418
Hi.
Hi.

370
00:46:07,494 --> 00:46:10,588
Jesus.
What's the matter?

371
00:46:10,664 --> 00:46:13,895
"What's the matter?"
Her wigs, her clothes.

372
00:46:13,967 --> 00:46:18,097
Sometimes I just feel like
throwing them all away, you know?

373
00:46:18,171 --> 00:46:20,264
What are you looking for, Zoe?

374
00:46:25,846 --> 00:46:28,610
I mean, is this where you see your future?
My future?

375
00:46:30,684 --> 00:46:32,618
The club?

376
00:46:35,288 --> 00:46:40,783
When Mom died, my immediate idea was
to get rid of this place. Just sell it.

377
00:46:40,861 --> 00:46:46,026
I never thought it would have any interest for me.
So why did it?

378
00:46:52,139 --> 00:46:54,903
I used to be very shy
as a child.

379
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,569
I used to watch
my mother for hours...

380
00:46:57,644 --> 00:47:01,410
just admiring
her sense of freedom.

381
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:07,018
So when the opportunity came up,
I thought I would take on the challenge.

382
00:47:07,087 --> 00:47:11,956
So you feel better about adopting her
options rather than creating your own?

383
00:47:13,827 --> 00:47:15,988
I have created
my own options too.

384
00:47:16,063 --> 00:47:18,429
Oh, I know.

385
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,703
It's your contract
for the baby with Eric.

386
00:47:30,777 --> 00:47:33,143
I found it.

387
00:47:33,213 --> 00:47:36,273
Does he know?

388
00:47:36,349 --> 00:47:38,715
I would hope so.

389
00:47:38,785 --> 00:47:43,722
Otherwise he might just think I'm
disgusted with him for no particular reason.

390
00:47:45,959 --> 00:47:49,292
Look, I really desperately
needed this child...

391
00:47:49,362 --> 00:47:52,388
and it just worked out
with Eric.

392
00:47:52,466 --> 00:47:55,094
I didn't mean
to hurt you.

393
00:47:55,168 --> 00:47:58,797
You know, I remember
when your mother built this hallway.

394
00:47:58,872 --> 00:48:04,105
She, uh, she built it for this
very rich man who used to come here.

395
00:48:06,413 --> 00:48:09,905
He used to get off watching us dance for
other guys, so he actually paid her...

396
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:13,510
to construct this very special place
that he could watch us from.

397
00:48:15,288 --> 00:48:17,518
Your mother never told us that.

398
00:48:17,591 --> 00:48:20,185
She said it was
to protect us...

399
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:23,195
so she could patrol things.

400
00:48:26,466 --> 00:48:28,593
And I believed her.

401
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:32,764
Until Eric told me the truth.

402
00:48:35,709 --> 00:48:37,643
Why did you believe him?

403
00:48:37,711 --> 00:48:40,111
I made a choice.

404
00:48:43,116 --> 00:48:47,712
And Eric promised me
he'd never lie to me.

405
00:49:29,663 --> 00:49:33,121
How could anyone...

406
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,634
hurt you?

407
00:49:40,173 --> 00:49:43,108
Take you away from me?

408
00:49:48,048 --> 00:49:50,676
How could anyone?

409
00:50:38,531 --> 00:50:41,500
What's this machine?

410
00:50:41,568 --> 00:50:44,503
Uh, uh, it's an incubator.

411
00:50:44,571 --> 00:50:49,338
Wh-What's it for?
Well, what do you think it's for?

412
00:50:49,409 --> 00:50:51,934
Eggs.
That's right.

413
00:50:52,012 --> 00:50:55,072
Are they yours?

414
00:50:55,148 --> 00:50:57,742
Wh-What do you mean?

415
00:50:57,817 --> 00:51:02,379
I mean, shouldn't you be sitting on them or something?
Oh, yeah.

416
00:51:02,455 --> 00:51:05,754
Well, I guess
I've abandoned the nest.

417
00:51:15,168 --> 00:51:20,265
What's inside of them?

418
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:24,436
Uh, the eggs?
Yes.

419
00:51:24,511 --> 00:51:27,105
Well, uh, Hyacinth Macaws...

420
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:30,047
if you want to know
the absolute truth.

421
00:51:30,116 --> 00:51:32,710
And where did you get them?

422
00:51:32,786 --> 00:51:38,554
From... very far away.

423
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,734
Hey, check her out, eh?

424
00:51:59,646 --> 00:52:02,843
I said check her out.

425
00:52:02,916 --> 00:52:07,080
Yeah.
You talking to me?

426
00:52:07,153 --> 00:52:11,089
Uh, yes,
I'm talking to you.

427
00:52:13,159 --> 00:52:15,423
What? Check who out?

428
00:52:15,495 --> 00:52:18,191
The babe that's dancing
for you, man.

429
00:52:18,264 --> 00:52:22,428
You've given her quite a run
for your money, man.

430
00:52:22,502 --> 00:52:25,266
What do you mean by that?

431
00:52:25,338 --> 00:52:29,365
She's been dancing for you all night.
Yeah.

432
00:52:29,442 --> 00:52:33,435
Yeah, and not just tonight. I mean, I've
noticed you with her other nights too.

433
00:52:36,449 --> 00:52:39,976
You come in here all the time or-

434
00:52:40,053 --> 00:52:44,717
Uh... yeah.
All the time.

435
00:52:44,791 --> 00:52:49,387
This Visuals, you know?
It's good.

436
00:52:49,462 --> 00:52:52,727
But, uh...

437
00:52:52,799 --> 00:52:57,634
she seems to have a bit
of a thing for you, doesn't she?

438
00:52:59,472 --> 00:53:03,033
We, uh... get along.

439
00:53:03,109 --> 00:53:07,239
I'm sure you do, my friend.

440
00:53:07,313 --> 00:53:11,079
What do you two
talk about, huh?

441
00:53:11,151 --> 00:53:16,748
Oh, just, uh...
the usual, I guess.

442
00:53:16,823 --> 00:53:18,757
The usual?

443
00:53:18,825 --> 00:53:23,762
I don't think you're talking
about what I would call "usual. "

444
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:26,594
Why not?
Because I can tell.

445
00:53:26,666 --> 00:53:30,193
You get pretty intense,
my friend.

446
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:32,795
Well, I guess that's
just the way I am.

447
00:53:36,443 --> 00:53:41,710
So, uh, Hey, wh-why don't you
give her a little touch, huh?

448
00:53:41,781 --> 00:53:47,549
You're not supposed to touch.
Ah, but she is into it, believe me.

449
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:50,885
Yeah.

450
00:53:50,957 --> 00:53:56,395
How do you know?
Everybody knows, man.

451
00:53:56,463 --> 00:53:59,193
Trust me, my friend.

452
00:53:59,265 --> 00:54:03,224
Trust me.
Just a little touch.

453
00:54:03,303 --> 00:54:07,399
Nothing too drastic.

454
00:54:07,474 --> 00:54:11,740
Then you will get
the full experience, my friend...

455
00:54:11,811 --> 00:54:14,371
and you will love it.

456
00:54:14,447 --> 00:54:18,907
You will love it. Okay?

457
00:54:18,985 --> 00:54:23,649
And what happens
when I touch her?

458
00:54:23,723 --> 00:54:28,251
What happens?

459
00:55:03,796 --> 00:55:07,493
You're outta here, man!
Get out!

460
00:55:10,803 --> 00:55:13,567
Come on.
Get down there.

461
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,302
Come on. Go.

462
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:34,653
Hey, what the hell you doin'?
Get off the road!

463
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:43,063
Move!

464
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:05,355
What's so funny?

465
00:56:05,425 --> 00:56:08,519
It's like pettin' a gorilla.

466
00:56:08,595 --> 00:56:11,360
Well-

467
00:56:11,431 --> 00:56:14,367
Was your father this hairy?

468
00:56:14,434 --> 00:56:18,531
No, I, uh, I got it
from my mother.

469
00:56:18,605 --> 00:56:21,040
I mean, I mean,
from my mother's side of the family.

470
00:56:21,108 --> 00:56:26,876
That's where you, um,
inherit hair patterns.

471
00:56:26,947 --> 00:56:31,817
My uncle's bald.
On your mother's side?

472
00:56:31,886 --> 00:56:34,320
Mm-hmm.

473
00:56:34,389 --> 00:56:38,154
Well, um, I guess I'm talking
about usual patterns.

474
00:56:38,225 --> 00:56:42,663
Hmm.
There's always exceptions.

475
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:45,323
That's-

476
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:50,838
That's the way these things... work.

477
00:57:01,749 --> 00:57:04,582
Shouldn't you go
to the hospital?

478
00:57:04,651 --> 00:57:07,677
No, I'm fine.

479
00:57:07,755 --> 00:57:11,690
You don't look fine.

480
00:57:11,758 --> 00:57:15,058
You worry about me, don't you?

481
00:57:15,129 --> 00:57:19,189
You think this is normal?

482
00:57:19,267 --> 00:57:23,499
What?
What we do.

483
00:57:25,939 --> 00:57:28,305
What do we do?

484
00:57:30,377 --> 00:57:33,210
That's just it.
We don't speak about it.

485
00:57:33,281 --> 00:57:39,151
You know that feeling
you get sometimes, Tracey...

486
00:57:39,219 --> 00:57:42,450
that you didn't ask to be
brought into the world?

487
00:57:44,224 --> 00:57:46,158
Yeah.

488
00:57:48,062 --> 00:57:50,257
Well, then who did?

489
00:57:50,331 --> 00:57:52,491
What?

490
00:57:52,567 --> 00:57:54,932
If you think that
you didn't ask...

491
00:57:55,003 --> 00:57:58,938
to be brought
into the world...

492
00:57:59,007 --> 00:58:01,567
then who did?

493
00:58:15,723 --> 00:58:20,854
All I'm saying is nobody asked you if
you wanted to be brought into the world.

494
00:58:20,927 --> 00:58:24,364
You just ended up getting here.

495
00:58:26,433 --> 00:58:30,461
So the question is,
now that you're here...

496
00:58:30,538 --> 00:58:34,474
who's asking you to stay?

497
00:58:45,052 --> 00:58:47,987
Thanks.
Thank you.

498
00:58:48,056 --> 00:58:51,354
Look, are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

499
00:58:51,426 --> 00:58:54,326
Yes.

500
00:58:54,395 --> 00:58:56,385
Good night.

501
00:59:01,569 --> 00:59:03,503
Good night.

502
00:59:12,313 --> 00:59:14,337
He touched you?
He didn't want to.

503
00:59:14,414 --> 00:59:17,407
What do you mean?
I know him.

504
00:59:17,485 --> 00:59:22,479
We all know him. He's crazy about you.
Not like that.

505
00:59:22,557 --> 00:59:24,718
Why didn't you get one of the boys
to handle this, Eric?

506
00:59:24,791 --> 00:59:28,022
Because I didn't think of it.

507
00:59:28,095 --> 00:59:30,563
I just saw him touch her, and-

508
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:32,622
Why didn't you
ask him to leave?

509
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,895
Because he wouldn't have listened.
How do you know that?

510
00:59:34,968 --> 00:59:37,961
Because he's in his own world,
the ass-wipe.

511
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:40,234
I don't know
where you're both coming from.

512
00:59:40,307 --> 00:59:44,642
You are telling me that he touched you,
but he really didn't.

513
00:59:44,712 --> 00:59:48,239
And you're saying that you overreacted,
but you didn't have a choice?

514
00:59:48,315 --> 00:59:52,082
I didn't.
Why not?

515
00:59:52,152 --> 00:59:57,614
Why not?
Because he touched you.

516
00:59:57,691 --> 01:00:00,991
Okay.

517
01:00:01,061 --> 01:00:03,690
All I'm concerned about
is if he makes a case...

518
01:00:03,763 --> 01:00:07,494
I have to know
what happened.

519
01:00:07,568 --> 01:00:09,626
We told you
what happened, Zoe.

520
01:00:09,703 --> 01:00:12,832
And that is what happened?

521
01:00:18,078 --> 01:00:21,537
Yeah.
Okay.

522
01:00:21,616 --> 01:00:24,482
Is that it?

523
01:00:27,421 --> 01:00:29,513
Hi. This is Thomas.

524
01:00:29,589 --> 01:00:31,854
I am not in at the present time,
but I am in town.

525
01:00:31,926 --> 01:00:36,693
Please leave a message
following the beep.

526
01:00:36,763 --> 01:00:38,856
Good morning.

527
01:00:38,933 --> 01:00:43,369
You're probably not up yet,
so you haven't seen what I've done.

528
01:00:43,436 --> 01:00:47,032
I'm a customs officer
at the airport.

529
01:00:47,107 --> 01:00:52,205
Actually, I saw you the other day when
you were having your bags inspected.

530
01:00:52,279 --> 01:00:56,215
I knowI know how you probably
smuggled those eggs in.

531
01:00:56,284 --> 01:01:01,051
There's a special unit at work. I think
they give them to the zoo or something.

532
01:01:01,121 --> 01:01:06,058
They asked me where I got them.
I had to lie.

533
01:01:06,126 --> 01:01:08,061
Where are they?

534
01:01:08,128 --> 01:01:10,722
I took them.
Where?

535
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:13,732
I'd like to see you again.
Oh, no.

536
01:01:13,801 --> 01:01:16,599
Uh, no, they're in the country now.
Uh, they're definitely in the country.

537
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:20,573
It's just I don't have them, uh, with me
presently, but it doesn't mean I can't get them.

538
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,905
And if you can give me, like,
uh, just, uh, um, a couple-

539
01:01:23,977 --> 01:01:27,072
Good morning.
Hi. Uh, and, uh, I'm here. Okay.

540
01:01:27,147 --> 01:01:30,174
So I'll call-
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

541
01:01:30,251 --> 01:01:32,685
You look like you're
in worse shape than I am.

542
01:01:32,753 --> 01:01:35,847
Uh... what happened to you?

543
01:01:35,923 --> 01:01:38,686
Oh, I fell down
some stairs and-

544
01:01:38,758 --> 01:01:42,354
Are you okay?
Well, do I look okay?

545
01:01:42,429 --> 01:01:46,866
Uh, no, not really. Well, I'm better than I look.
Here, I got you a coffee.

546
01:01:46,933 --> 01:01:49,698
I didn't, uh-
I didn't know how you took it.

547
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:52,034
Oh, black's fine.
Oh.

548
01:01:52,106 --> 01:01:55,200
Uh, I added cream.
Oh, that's okay.

549
01:01:55,275 --> 01:01:59,041
No, here, have mine. No, I insist.
No, really-

550
01:02:02,616 --> 01:02:04,710
What is it?

551
01:02:04,784 --> 01:02:08,880
Well, it's just that
this has cream in it too.

552
01:02:08,955 --> 01:02:11,549
It's milk.

553
01:02:11,626 --> 01:02:14,390
Oh. Oh, good.

554
01:02:14,462 --> 01:02:16,395
Okay, well, I'll, uh-

555
01:02:16,464 --> 01:02:19,399
I'll get to work.

556
01:03:03,777 --> 01:03:06,371
Mmm, what?

557
01:03:06,447 --> 01:03:08,880
What is it?

558
01:03:08,948 --> 01:03:13,544
What is it that gives a schoolgirl
her special innocence?

559
01:03:15,289 --> 01:03:19,224
Is it the way they smell?

560
01:03:19,292 --> 01:03:24,229
The sweet smell
of their perfume, of their hair?

561
01:03:24,298 --> 01:03:28,791
The aroma
of fresh flowers...

562
01:03:28,868 --> 01:03:30,837
and all that other stuff
that hasn't been fucked up...

563
01:03:30,904 --> 01:03:34,340
by late nights
and a lot of bad food.

564
01:03:37,243 --> 01:03:43,012
Is it their gestures...
and the way they move?

565
01:03:43,084 --> 01:03:48,181
The way their body still holds on
to some semblance of self-respect and...

566
01:03:48,255 --> 01:03:52,020
and dignity?

567
01:03:52,092 --> 01:03:56,359
When they wrap
their beautiful legs around you...

568
01:03:56,429 --> 01:04:00,366
tight and holding on,
looking at you...

569
01:04:00,433 --> 01:04:02,367
you looking at them.

570
01:04:02,435 --> 01:04:05,701
It's just-

571
01:04:05,773 --> 01:04:08,536
Or is it whatever comes out
of their cute little mouths?

572
01:04:08,608 --> 01:04:12,044
All those questions,
all that wondering that-

573
01:04:17,117 --> 01:04:21,713
It's just, you know, you
They got their whole lives ahead of them, you know?

574
01:04:21,789 --> 01:04:25,225
And you've wasted
half of yours away.

575
01:04:25,292 --> 01:04:27,226
Damn.

576
01:04:28,962 --> 01:04:31,055
What is it?

577
01:04:33,567 --> 01:04:36,660
There's this feeling
I get sometimes, you know?

578
01:04:36,736 --> 01:04:39,331
What sort of feeling?

579
01:04:39,406 --> 01:04:44,343
That I wasn't ever meant
to be satisfied.

580
01:04:44,411 --> 01:04:47,505
Satisfied with what?

581
01:04:47,581 --> 01:04:50,015
A lot of things.

582
01:04:50,083 --> 01:04:52,518
I mean, it seems to me
that every time I'm about to...

583
01:04:52,586 --> 01:04:57,023
you know, get a hold
of something or someone...

584
01:04:57,091 --> 01:05:02,357
it's just bound
to slip away.

585
01:05:02,429 --> 01:05:05,024
Maybe you want it
to slip away.

586
01:05:05,098 --> 01:05:08,363
Maybe I want what
to slip away?

587
01:05:08,435 --> 01:05:13,533
The things that you think
you're about to have.

588
01:05:13,606 --> 01:05:17,372
What would you
think about that?

589
01:05:17,444 --> 01:05:20,539
As a general philosophy...

590
01:05:20,613 --> 01:05:22,877
or how it pertains to you?

591
01:05:22,949 --> 01:05:26,044
You think you could talk
about how it pertains to me?

592
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,553
What do you mean?

593
01:05:28,621 --> 01:05:32,649
Well, I feel
like I want you.

594
01:05:32,726 --> 01:05:37,823
Do you think that means
you'll slip away?

595
01:05:43,571 --> 01:05:46,266
Dad?

596
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:51,106
I'm not going to baby-sit
for Uncle Francis anymore.

597
01:05:51,178 --> 01:05:54,341
Baby-sit?
You go there to practice.

598
01:05:54,414 --> 01:05:57,679
That's absurd.

599
01:05:57,751 --> 01:06:00,150
Why?

600
01:06:00,221 --> 01:06:05,523
Dad, he pretends
I'm still baby-sitting for him.

601
01:06:05,592 --> 01:06:08,026
Why would you think that?

602
01:06:08,095 --> 01:06:10,063
Because he's paying me.

603
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:12,996
To house-sit.

604
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:19,329
Twenty dollars an hour?

605
01:06:19,405 --> 01:06:22,807
When did it go up?

606
01:06:22,876 --> 01:06:25,709
He wants to believe
that Lisa's still there.

607
01:06:25,779 --> 01:06:28,838
I make it easier for him
to convince himself.

608
01:06:31,552 --> 01:06:35,988
Francis always had strange ways
to convince himself...

609
01:06:36,055 --> 01:06:38,991
of many things.

610
01:06:39,058 --> 01:06:44,827
Things that never happened,
things that might happen.

611
01:06:44,899 --> 01:06:50,496
People who did things
for reasons, but they didn't.

612
01:06:52,573 --> 01:06:57,010
What has any of this
got to do with me, Dad?

613
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:03,515
Nothing.

614
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:06,678
Nothing at all.

615
01:07:06,754 --> 01:07:10,689
So why do I have
to keep going there?

616
01:07:10,757 --> 01:07:13,021
You don't.

617
01:07:13,092 --> 01:07:15,526
And you'll tell him?

618
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,861
I was in here the other night
when that guy was thrown out.

619
01:07:24,938 --> 01:07:29,637
Why did that happen?
Has he ever been thrown out before?

620
01:07:29,709 --> 01:07:33,805
Why do you think he would touch you?
Why do you think he would touch you?

621
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,975
Why do you think he would touch you?

622
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:40,645
Well, what do you think
was going through his mind when he-

623
01:07:40,721 --> 01:07:44,316
Or-Or what was he thinking?

624
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:46,985
Well-
What's so funny?

625
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:48,995
Well, this is a joke, right?

626
01:07:49,063 --> 01:07:51,327
Not at all.

627
01:07:51,398 --> 01:07:56,130
If you do this favor for me,
I'll do that favor for you.

628
01:07:59,238 --> 01:08:01,900
But I'm not hiding anything.

629
01:08:01,976 --> 01:08:06,275
Thomas, you're hiding
a smuggling operation...

630
01:08:06,347 --> 01:08:11,341
that brings in over $200,000 a year,
probably a lot more.

631
01:08:11,418 --> 01:08:13,443
We've suspected you
for a long time.

632
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:17,011
I was just brought in to confirm
what was already known.

633
01:08:17,091 --> 01:08:19,582
So how do you want me
to report back?

634
01:08:23,429 --> 01:08:27,092
All I'm asking
for is a bit of help.

635
01:08:27,167 --> 01:08:29,727
That's all.

636
01:08:29,803 --> 01:08:34,365
It's very important for me to know these
things. Just ask her these questions.

637
01:08:34,441 --> 01:08:38,707
Do this for me,
and you have a clean slate.

638
01:08:38,779 --> 01:08:44,581
This really hasn't been my day.

639
01:08:44,651 --> 01:08:49,088
So change things.
Make it your day.

640
01:08:51,225 --> 01:08:53,659
And all you men sitting
near that stage, I can see you.

641
01:08:53,727 --> 01:08:55,819
I know what you're thinking.

642
01:08:55,895 --> 01:08:59,160
You're thinking that "because I'm
sitting next to that stage...

643
01:08:59,232 --> 01:09:01,996
I'm getting the same feeling
as all those guys...

644
01:09:02,068 --> 01:09:06,005
shoveling out that cash
for their own private dancer. "

645
01:09:06,073 --> 01:09:10,169
Well, you know, you guys want
to watch, go to the movies.

646
01:09:10,244 --> 01:09:13,007
We're in the live-action
business here, gents.

647
01:09:13,079 --> 01:09:18,847
And, okay, granted
Granted, that beautiful creature writhing before you on stage...

648
01:09:18,919 --> 01:09:22,012
she maybe, you know, smiles at you.

649
01:09:22,088 --> 01:09:24,023
She winks her eyes at you occasionally...

650
01:09:24,091 --> 01:09:26,355
and you may feel like the man.

651
01:09:26,427 --> 01:09:28,418
Is that all you guys
are looking for?

652
01:09:28,495 --> 01:09:32,453
Is that all you want?
Come on, come on.

653
01:09:32,533 --> 01:09:36,468
Invite one of our lovely ladies over
to your table where the real action is.

654
01:09:36,536 --> 01:09:39,130
Yeah!
Hi.

655
01:09:39,206 --> 01:09:41,799
I'm really sorry that took so long,
or I took so long.

656
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:43,967
Hi.
It's such a busy night.

657
01:09:44,044 --> 01:09:46,978
Hi. I'm Chrissy.

658
01:09:47,047 --> 01:09:49,810
Hi. I'm Thomas.

659
01:09:49,882 --> 01:09:54,319
It's nice to meet you, Thomas.
I like the name Thomas a lot.

660
01:09:54,387 --> 01:09:56,322
Oh, thanks.

661
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:58,482
Are you from out of town?

662
01:09:58,558 --> 01:10:00,492
Yes.

663
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,824
Where are you from?

664
01:10:02,895 --> 01:10:06,991
Um... San Francisco.

665
01:10:07,067 --> 01:10:09,831
Oh, you're kidding.
I love San Francisco.

666
01:10:09,903 --> 01:10:12,496
Oh, you've-
You've been there?

667
01:10:12,573 --> 01:10:17,840
Yeah, I was there a couple of years ago
with my debating team.

668
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:20,004
Debating team?
Mm-hmm.

669
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:23,846
Um, that's. I admire
someone who can debate well.

670
01:10:23,917 --> 01:10:27,010
I mean, who can debate
instead of just argue.

671
01:10:27,087 --> 01:10:31,524
Well, anyone can argue, but it's
a good skill, uh, discipline...

672
01:10:31,592 --> 01:10:34,356
to be able to debate
and stand back.

673
01:10:34,428 --> 01:10:37,693
Um, and that's something
you can apply in your life...

674
01:10:37,765 --> 01:10:40,029
outside of school.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

675
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:43,034
And, and when you're meeting
someone or negotiating.

676
01:10:43,102 --> 01:10:47,539
Negotiating?
Well, I mean, if you have... If you have to...

677
01:10:47,607 --> 01:10:52,544
Um, it's a good skill to learn,
as opposed to cheerleading or-

678
01:10:52,612 --> 01:10:54,547
Well, that's what I say.

679
01:10:54,615 --> 01:10:57,049
Don't be nervous
about this, Thomas.

680
01:10:57,116 --> 01:11:00,553
We're gonna have some fun, okay?
Sure.

681
01:11:00,621 --> 01:11:03,215
Sure.

682
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:20,396
Um... um...

683
01:11:20,473 --> 01:11:24,740
I was here
the other night, um-

684
01:11:24,812 --> 01:11:26,746
What night was that?

685
01:11:26,813 --> 01:11:30,010
The night th-that guy
was thrown out.

686
01:11:30,082 --> 01:11:32,347
You were dancing for him.

687
01:11:32,419 --> 01:11:35,353
His name is Francis.

688
01:11:35,422 --> 01:11:37,947
Um... what happened?

689
01:11:42,596 --> 01:11:45,530
He was a bad boy.

690
01:11:45,598 --> 01:11:50,467
Wh-What do you mean by that?
What do I mean?

691
01:11:50,536 --> 01:11:53,563
I mean, have you danced
for him before a lot?

692
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,573
Mm-hmm.

693
01:11:55,641 --> 01:11:58,770
And has he ever been thrown out before?
No.

694
01:11:58,846 --> 01:12:01,006
So what do you
think happened?

695
01:12:01,081 --> 01:12:04,208
He touched me.

696
01:12:04,284 --> 01:12:07,218
And when you're dancing
for the customer...

697
01:12:07,286 --> 01:12:10,050
they can't touch.

698
01:12:10,122 --> 01:12:12,956
Yes, but why do you think
he touched you last night?

699
01:12:13,025 --> 01:12:15,755
Has he ever touched you before?

700
01:12:15,828 --> 01:12:18,889
Is this what you really want to talk
about for five bucks a dance, Thomas?

701
01:12:18,966 --> 01:12:23,164
Well, I just want to know
what you think was going on in his mind.

702
01:12:23,236 --> 01:12:26,603
Are you here for some kind
of psychology conference?

703
01:12:26,673 --> 01:12:30,506
Uh, well, uh, yes.

704
01:12:30,577 --> 01:12:33,341
Uh, I am, actually.

705
01:12:33,412 --> 01:12:36,348
He's, uh-

706
01:12:36,416 --> 01:12:39,680
He's a very particular case.

707
01:12:39,753 --> 01:12:43,017
Particular in what way?

708
01:12:45,758 --> 01:12:50,025
Um...
you want the full story?

709
01:12:50,096 --> 01:12:54,397
Sure.

710
01:12:59,105 --> 01:13:02,074
His daughter was murdered
a couple of years ago...

711
01:13:02,141 --> 01:13:05,703
and then he was implicated.

712
01:13:05,778 --> 01:13:08,372
For th-the murder?
Yeah.

713
01:13:08,448 --> 01:13:13,715
But why?
I don't know. I don't really remember the details.

714
01:13:13,786 --> 01:13:16,880
I mean, he was cleared, and then
they caught the guy who did it.

715
01:13:16,957 --> 01:13:21,223
But... it obviously had,
like, this...

716
01:13:21,294 --> 01:13:23,228
this incredible effect on him.

717
01:13:23,296 --> 01:13:26,562
I mean, he is-

718
01:13:26,632 --> 01:13:30,659
He's just so fucked up about it.

719
01:13:30,736 --> 01:13:32,670
Oh.

720
01:13:34,908 --> 01:13:39,004
You know...

721
01:13:39,079 --> 01:13:42,014
Thomas...

722
01:13:42,082 --> 01:13:46,746
Francis and I have
a very special type of relationship.

723
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:50,016
And I've never-
I've never minded.

724
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:53,525
But then he chose
to violate it.

725
01:13:53,592 --> 01:13:56,357
S-Special in what way?

726
01:14:02,102 --> 01:14:06,869
Well, we've, we've always
had this understanding.

727
01:14:06,939 --> 01:14:10,034
I mean, I need him
for certain things...

728
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:13,044
and... he needs me
for certain things.

729
01:14:13,112 --> 01:14:15,546
I mean, that's the way it's been.

730
01:14:15,614 --> 01:14:18,880
Uh, and how did he
violate that?

731
01:14:18,951 --> 01:14:24,719
He-He violated that in his-his, in his
role and what he was supposed to do for me.

732
01:14:24,791 --> 01:14:27,282
Wh-What's he s... Why?

733
01:14:27,361 --> 01:14:30,592
What's he supposed to do for you? I
mean, he comes to this club. He pays you.

734
01:14:30,663 --> 01:14:34,497
Because I was
doing things for him...

735
01:14:34,567 --> 01:14:37,560
and he's done things for me.

736
01:14:40,907 --> 01:14:44,171
What has he done for you?

737
01:14:44,244 --> 01:14:47,178
I'm-

738
01:14:47,246 --> 01:14:50,682
I'm sorry.

739
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:55,813
Okay, this is really stupid.

740
01:14:55,889 --> 01:15:01,690
And then I'm getting so emotional
over the fact that he touched me...

741
01:15:01,762 --> 01:15:06,027
because, I mean, he was,
he was always paying me...

742
01:15:06,099 --> 01:15:09,192
to do him this favor and-

743
01:15:09,268 --> 01:15:11,203
What favor?
I don't know, Thomas.

744
01:15:11,271 --> 01:15:15,207
Why do you want to know all this?
Well, I'm sorry, but I, uh-

745
01:15:15,275 --> 01:15:19,768
What is it about a schoolgirl that gives
her that special innocence, gentlemen?

746
01:15:19,845 --> 01:15:23,872
Such a thing that you have
absolutely no control over.

747
01:15:23,949 --> 01:15:27,544
You never have.

748
01:15:27,621 --> 01:15:31,717
And you never will.

749
01:15:31,792 --> 01:15:34,988
After this break, we'll be right back with sweet Chrissy...
He not supposed to do that.

750
01:15:35,062 --> 01:15:36,996
who'll help us answer that question.
Do what?

751
01:15:37,063 --> 01:15:38,997
He's not supposed to-
He's not suppose-

752
01:15:39,065 --> 01:15:41,830
He can obviously see from his booth that
I'm sitting here talking with a client.

753
01:15:41,901 --> 01:15:44,666
He's not supposed to call me
when I'm talking with a client.

754
01:15:44,737 --> 01:15:48,673
Why? Do you have to go now?

755
01:15:50,076 --> 01:15:52,011
Uh, yeah.

756
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:56,175
But I want to come back,
and I want to, you know, talk.

757
01:15:56,248 --> 01:16:00,185
But I want to move downstairs.
I don't like it here.

758
01:16:00,253 --> 01:16:02,187
Sure, sure, sure.

759
01:16:02,255 --> 01:16:05,451
Okay. I'll see you soon.

760
01:16:12,265 --> 01:16:17,601
Uh, I'm going to move
to the washroom.

761
01:16:45,564 --> 01:16:50,502
Hey, I've noticed you've been spending
a lot of time with that lady.

762
01:16:50,570 --> 01:16:53,004
Are youAre you talking to me?

763
01:16:53,073 --> 01:16:55,336
Yeah.

764
01:16:55,408 --> 01:16:59,742
You seem, uh, to, to both
hit it off together.

765
01:16:59,813 --> 01:17:02,338
Well, I guess.
Yeah.

766
01:17:02,415 --> 01:17:04,575
Um, I guess
that can happen.

767
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:08,849
So what do you guys talk about?

768
01:17:08,921 --> 01:17:12,358
Oh, just things.

769
01:17:12,425 --> 01:17:16,190
What sort of things?

770
01:17:16,263 --> 01:17:18,197
Oh, this and that.

771
01:17:18,265 --> 01:17:20,596
"This and that," eh?

772
01:17:20,667 --> 01:17:24,694
You know, it's amazing how...

773
01:17:24,771 --> 01:17:29,298
you can hit it off with someone
like that, isn't it?

774
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:37,976
Have you ever noticed that
some people just drift into your life...

775
01:17:38,051 --> 01:17:41,851
like you've known them forever?

776
01:17:41,921 --> 01:17:44,823
I mean, there are some people
that you can remember...

777
01:17:44,890 --> 01:17:49,658
the moment that you met them
really clearly.

778
01:17:49,728 --> 01:17:52,823
And other people that...

779
01:17:52,899 --> 01:17:58,667
it seems like you've known them forever,
even though you haven't.

780
01:17:58,737 --> 01:18:03,505
And they all become part of this
continuous memory you have of yourself.

781
01:18:03,576 --> 01:18:07,342
This ongoing-

782
01:18:07,413 --> 01:18:09,348
Are you with me?

783
01:18:09,416 --> 01:18:13,011
Uh, yeah, I think so.

784
01:18:13,085 --> 01:18:15,019
I mean, here you are,
y-you know...

785
01:18:15,088 --> 01:18:17,352
you're having this beautiful
conversation with her.

786
01:18:17,423 --> 01:18:22,521
You're getting to know
each other, and-

787
01:18:22,595 --> 01:18:26,861
I mean, there's other guys
that come in here.

788
01:18:26,932 --> 01:18:30,801
There's this one guy who comes in here
every other night or something...

789
01:18:30,870 --> 01:18:34,966
and he spends
a few hours with her.

790
01:18:35,041 --> 01:18:37,475
But he never really
gets to know her, you know?

791
01:18:37,544 --> 01:18:41,980
Not the way you have.
Not the way you two-

792
01:18:45,384 --> 01:18:49,980
She really seems
to be herself with you.

793
01:18:52,391 --> 01:18:55,326
Well, how do you know?

794
01:18:57,397 --> 01:19:00,160
What? That she's being herself?

795
01:19:00,233 --> 01:19:03,326
Yeah.

796
01:19:03,402 --> 01:19:08,340
Because I used to be her lover.

797
01:19:08,408 --> 01:19:12,173
I'm, uh, sorry, sir.
I can't let you in.

798
01:19:12,245 --> 01:19:14,678
Look, why not?

799
01:19:16,248 --> 01:19:19,843
Look, can I... Can I at least
just talk to the manager?

800
01:19:19,919 --> 01:19:24,117
You want to talk to the manager?
Yeah.

801
01:19:24,189 --> 01:19:28,024
You have to understand that
we have very strict rules...

802
01:19:28,093 --> 01:19:30,619
regarding
this sort of behavior here.

803
01:19:30,697 --> 01:19:34,292
And I have always respected them.
And this one time you didn't.

804
01:19:34,367 --> 01:19:37,130
Now, the problem, Mr. Brown,
is that this one time...

805
01:19:37,203 --> 01:19:41,298
happened in a room full
of other men who were watching.

806
01:19:41,373 --> 01:19:43,638
Now, if I let you
back into the club...

807
01:19:43,709 --> 01:19:47,646
what's to stop them from trying to do the same thing?
I told you.

808
01:19:47,714 --> 01:19:50,807
Someone told me to do it.
I was set up.

809
01:19:50,883 --> 01:19:55,479
And you believed that someone?

810
01:19:55,554 --> 01:19:59,650
This is, uh, Security.
Please, sit down.

811
01:19:59,726 --> 01:20:01,659
Thank you.

812
01:20:03,897 --> 01:20:07,332
Why did you touch her?

813
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:11,130
Well, I needed to make sure.
Why?

814
01:20:11,204 --> 01:20:14,229
What if she let you?
What would you have done?

815
01:20:14,306 --> 01:20:16,832
I'd have been disappointed.

816
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:22,346
I'm not sure...
I understand you.

817
01:20:22,415 --> 01:20:25,782
That's not the way
she was raised.

818
01:20:25,852 --> 01:20:28,411
You know her?
Personally?

819
01:20:30,422 --> 01:20:34,188
There is another club
I can recommend.

820
01:20:34,259 --> 01:20:36,352
I need to come here.

821
01:20:36,428 --> 01:20:40,990
I understand that very well.
No, I don't think you understand.

822
01:20:41,066 --> 01:20:44,696
Exotica is a special place.

823
01:20:44,771 --> 01:20:49,367
My mother was dedicated to creating
a very particular type of atmosphere...

824
01:20:49,441 --> 01:20:52,604
and I would like
to maintain that.

825
01:20:52,678 --> 01:20:56,307
You don't understand.

826
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:04,352
Mr. Brown, we're all aware
of what you've gone through.

827
01:21:04,423 --> 01:21:07,221
You've suffered a lot.

828
01:21:07,293 --> 01:21:12,390
But you have to understand
that Exotica is here for your amusement.

829
01:21:12,465 --> 01:21:15,992
We're here to entertain,
not to heal.

830
01:21:16,069 --> 01:21:19,401
There are other places for that.

831
01:21:22,307 --> 01:21:24,242
Other places?

832
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:28,406
I can give you a list.

833
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,505
Mr. Brown?

834
01:21:30,582 --> 01:21:32,641
Are you listening to me,
Mr. Brown?

835
01:21:46,265 --> 01:21:49,030
Um...

836
01:21:49,102 --> 01:21:54,540
um, I just met this man
in the washroom.

837
01:21:54,607 --> 01:21:56,541
What man?

838
01:21:56,609 --> 01:21:58,543
Well, I'm not sure.
I was in a booth.

839
01:21:58,611 --> 01:22:01,044
I didn't really have
a chance to see him.

840
01:22:01,113 --> 01:22:05,209
So how did you meet him?
He just started talking to me.

841
01:22:05,284 --> 01:22:07,378
And what did he say?

842
01:22:07,454 --> 01:22:12,390
Well, um, he said
he used to be your lover.

843
01:22:12,458 --> 01:22:15,689
Well, it's always
a sad moment, gentlemen...

844
01:22:15,762 --> 01:22:20,721
when that clock
strikes that magic hour...

845
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:26,397
and we have to send you out
into the long and dark and lonely night.

846
01:22:28,475 --> 01:22:31,842
But just remember...

847
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:36,348
we're only ever
just a dream away...

848
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:39,179
wherever that is.

849
01:22:57,269 --> 01:23:00,205
I guess-
I have to go.

850
01:23:01,774 --> 01:23:04,207
Oh, okay.

851
01:23:04,276 --> 01:23:06,871
Um, wait a minute.

852
01:23:06,946 --> 01:23:11,542
Oh, no. Thomas, don't.
No, no, no.

853
01:23:11,618 --> 01:23:16,384
Thomas, please, don't.
Uh... no, no. Uh, I insist.

854
01:23:16,456 --> 01:23:18,548
Please.

855
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:22,052
Thank you.

856
01:23:30,602 --> 01:23:33,162
Your dad told me about, um...

857
01:23:33,238 --> 01:23:36,833
you not wanting
to baby-sit anymore.

858
01:23:36,909 --> 01:23:40,676
There's no baby to sit.

859
01:23:43,416 --> 01:23:47,181
Well, I just want you
to know, I understand.

860
01:23:47,253 --> 01:23:50,688
Understand what?

861
01:23:50,756 --> 01:23:55,125
That this might all seem
a little weird.

862
01:23:55,194 --> 01:23:58,526
A little?

863
01:23:59,932 --> 01:24:05,098
I just want to thank you, Tracey.
For what?

864
01:24:09,609 --> 01:24:12,703
You've been very patient.

865
01:24:12,778 --> 01:24:16,215
And, uh...

866
01:24:16,282 --> 01:24:20,718
if you think the time has come
for this to end, then I understand.

867
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:31,328
Thank you.

868
01:24:31,397 --> 01:24:33,831
Good night, Francis.

869
01:24:54,454 --> 01:24:57,514
He-He-He calls me from a table to dance.
Of course I expect you to do something.

870
01:24:57,590 --> 01:25:00,525
Christina, And then,And then, he
follows this guy to the washroom...

871
01:25:00,592 --> 01:25:03,527
and he tells this guy that, that he was my lover.
Well, he was.

872
01:25:03,595 --> 01:25:06,360
It's going too far, Zoe.

873
01:25:06,431 --> 01:25:11,369
Actually, baby, you have
no idea how far it's gone.

874
01:25:11,437 --> 01:25:14,031
You know, I told him to touch you.

875
01:25:14,107 --> 01:25:17,907
I said you were into it. Yeah.

876
01:25:17,977 --> 01:25:23,380
It used to be wonderful watching you dance
for him, seeing how you could soothe him.

877
01:25:24,784 --> 01:25:27,718
I mean, it soothed me.

878
01:25:27,786 --> 01:25:30,984
You know, you soothed me.

879
01:25:31,056 --> 01:25:33,047
Do you understand that?

880
01:25:36,396 --> 01:25:38,659
Hey, hey.
Don't, don't, don't!

881
01:25:38,730 --> 01:25:42,667
Stop. Stop that!
Don't fucking touch me, you fucker!

882
01:25:42,735 --> 01:25:45,329
Stop!
Just fuck off, Zoe!

883
01:25:45,405 --> 01:25:48,999
Stop it when I say! Eric!
Stop it! Ow!

884
01:25:49,074 --> 01:25:51,008
Chill out! Chill out!

885
01:25:51,076 --> 01:25:53,670
Chill out! Relax!

886
01:25:53,746 --> 01:25:56,340
All right? Relax!
Eric, come here!

887
01:25:56,416 --> 01:26:01,182
John! Get out. What's the matter?
No!

888
01:26:01,254 --> 01:26:04,518
Fuck off, Zoe! No!

889
01:26:28,948 --> 01:26:31,882
Morning, Thomas.

890
01:26:31,950 --> 01:26:35,477
What happened?
I had to leave.

891
01:26:35,554 --> 01:26:38,114
Did you, uh, hear everything?

892
01:26:38,190 --> 01:26:41,159
Yeah.

893
01:26:41,227 --> 01:26:43,821
Did you know?

894
01:26:43,896 --> 01:26:45,988
Did I know what?

895
01:26:46,064 --> 01:26:50,000
That she knew...
about your daughter.

896
01:27:00,912 --> 01:27:05,350
You know, when the,
when the police came to question me...

897
01:27:05,418 --> 01:27:09,184
they told me
a lot of things.

898
01:27:09,255 --> 01:27:13,691
They told me that my wife
was having an affair with my brother;

899
01:27:13,759 --> 01:27:16,695
had been for years.

900
01:27:16,763 --> 01:27:21,096
They told me that I thought
Lisa wasn't my daughter.

901
01:27:22,768 --> 01:27:26,034
They told me
I thought she was Harold's.

902
01:27:26,104 --> 01:27:28,163
Wh-Why would they say that?

903
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:32,803
Because they thought
I could harm her...

904
01:27:32,879 --> 01:27:37,646
that I would harm her.

905
01:27:37,717 --> 01:27:43,485
And then they found the man
that, uh, that did it.

906
01:27:43,555 --> 01:27:47,322
Let me go.

907
01:27:47,392 --> 01:27:51,488
And I went home.

908
01:27:54,233 --> 01:27:58,498
And then my wife was killed
in a car accident a couple months later.

909
01:27:58,571 --> 01:28:03,338
And, uh, Harold was in the car.

910
01:28:05,076 --> 01:28:08,137
He lived.

911
01:28:29,201 --> 01:28:31,294
What do you think
it would have taken...

912
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:34,805
for your father
to kill someone?

913
01:28:34,873 --> 01:28:39,640
I'm asking because there's
someone that I want to kill now.

914
01:28:39,711 --> 01:28:45,150
I felt it last night
as I listened to him in the washroom.

915
01:28:45,217 --> 01:28:47,311
I don't understand.

916
01:28:47,386 --> 01:28:51,322
He set me up...
to touch her.

917
01:28:51,390 --> 01:28:53,483
Why would he do that?

918
01:28:53,559 --> 01:28:58,155
He took something
very special from me.

919
01:28:58,230 --> 01:29:02,326
I've had too many
special things taken away.

920
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:07,338
That's why we have to go back tonight.
To kill him?

921
01:29:07,406 --> 01:29:10,499
What would you do, Thomas?
What would you do? Well-

922
01:29:10,575 --> 01:29:13,841
Well, I would talk to him.
I can't even get in there.

923
01:29:13,912 --> 01:29:16,848
What would you do?

924
01:29:16,916 --> 01:29:20,352
You go back tonight...

925
01:29:20,419 --> 01:29:23,013
and you have her
dance for you...

926
01:29:23,089 --> 01:29:25,956
and then you touch her.

927
01:29:26,025 --> 01:29:28,687
And he'll throw you out
just like he threw me out.

928
01:29:28,761 --> 01:29:31,285
But I'll be waiting outside
with the gun.

929
01:29:31,363 --> 01:29:34,390
I'm not gonna
help you kill somebody.

930
01:29:34,467 --> 01:29:37,732
Not even to save
a few years in prison?

931
01:29:37,803 --> 01:29:40,033
No.

932
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:44,804
Well, to help me then?

933
01:29:50,049 --> 01:29:53,484
And that was Mirella, gentlemen.
Mirella.

934
01:29:53,551 --> 01:29:56,987
You can have her at your own table
for only five dollars.

935
01:29:57,056 --> 01:29:59,319
Thank you, Mirella.

936
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:06,656
And now, it's always a pleasure
to announce to you our next dancer.

937
01:30:06,732 --> 01:30:10,828
Gentlemen, please, let's give
a big round of applause...

938
01:30:10,902 --> 01:30:16,102
for Christina.

939
01:33:43,915 --> 01:33:47,511
Don't be afraid.

940
01:33:47,585 --> 01:33:50,111
I know everything about you.

941
01:33:50,188 --> 01:33:54,125
What do you know about me?

942
01:33:56,428 --> 01:34:00,158
I found her.

943
01:34:00,232 --> 01:34:04,167
You found who?

944
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:12,034
Your little girl.

945
01:34:13,279 --> 01:34:16,214
Oh. Oh.

946
01:34:39,237 --> 01:34:41,433
I found her, man.

947
01:34:45,411 --> 01:34:47,344
I found her.

948
01:35:49,908 --> 01:35:53,844
Yeah, play something happy.
Play something happy.

949
01:35:53,911 --> 01:35:55,879
Yeah. Hello.

950
01:35:58,417 --> 01:36:00,850
Okay, I'll get it,
I'll get it, I'll get it.

951
01:36:07,592 --> 01:36:10,027
Hi, Christina.
Hi.

952
01:36:10,094 --> 01:36:15,362
I'm a little bit early.
Yeah, th-that's okay. Come on in.

953
01:36:20,339 --> 01:36:22,864
Yeah, I mean,
it's difficult for me to tell...

954
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:25,705
'cause I never had much
of a musical education myself...

955
01:36:25,777 --> 01:36:28,871
but her teacher thinks
she's really talented.

956
01:36:28,946 --> 01:36:32,973
And, um, actually, we were thinking
of buying her a better piano.

957
01:36:33,051 --> 01:36:35,987
An exotic baby grand,
you know?

958
01:36:36,054 --> 01:36:38,319
And when I mentioned "baby grand,"
do you know what she said to me?

959
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:42,826
She said, "Dad,
isn't that a contradiction in terms?"

960
01:36:42,895 --> 01:36:45,658
I mean, she just never
ceases to amaze me.

961
01:36:45,730 --> 01:36:47,665
I mean, she's eight years old.
Can you imagine?

962
01:36:47,732 --> 01:36:50,429
She can already identify-
Wh-What do you call that when...

963
01:36:50,502 --> 01:36:53,835
it's two words,
kind of cancel each other out?

964
01:36:53,906 --> 01:36:58,172
Oh, she just amazes me.

965
01:37:00,245 --> 01:37:05,011
Where's your mind?

966
01:37:05,083 --> 01:37:08,520
I was just thinking.

967
01:37:08,587 --> 01:37:11,852
About what?

968
01:37:11,924 --> 01:37:16,020
About the way
you talk about Lisa.

969
01:37:16,094 --> 01:37:18,688
You get so excited.

970
01:37:18,763 --> 01:37:22,699
It's nice.

971
01:37:24,103 --> 01:37:27,833
Well, I'm sure your parents
talk about you that way too.

972
01:37:27,906 --> 01:37:30,966
I don't think so.

973
01:37:31,042 --> 01:37:34,808
Oh, I do.

974
01:37:34,879 --> 01:37:36,973
Why?

975
01:37:37,049 --> 01:37:41,315
Because you're a very
responsible young woman.

976
01:37:41,386 --> 01:37:45,824
Responsible to what?

977
01:37:45,891 --> 01:37:50,658
Well, to whatever it is
you believe you have to do.

978
01:37:50,728 --> 01:37:54,824
Like what?

979
01:37:54,899 --> 01:38:00,736
Well, Lisa loves it when you
come over to baby-sit, for example.

980
01:38:02,908 --> 01:38:06,674
She says you really
listen to her.

981
01:38:06,745 --> 01:38:09,679
That's nice.

982
01:38:09,748 --> 01:38:12,444
She really listens
to me too.

983
01:38:18,424 --> 01:38:21,484
She thinks you're not very happy.

984
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:27,020
Listen, Christina,

985
01:38:27,098 --> 01:38:31,297
if there's, if there's ever anything
you want to talk about...

986
01:38:31,370 --> 01:38:34,897
about what might be going on
at home or whatever...

987
01:38:34,973 --> 01:38:39,808
you know that I'm here, okay?

988
01:38:41,712 --> 01:38:44,306
Okay.
Okay?

989
01:38:44,382 --> 01:38:46,475
Okay.

990
01:38:51,723 --> 01:38:55,317
Okay.

991
01:39:00,565 --> 01:39:03,797
Oh, no.
It's okay.

992
01:39:06,904 --> 01:39:08,998
Thank you.

993
01:39:16,415 --> 01:39:19,942
You know, I really enjoy
these drives home, Mr. Brown.

994
01:39:20,018 --> 01:39:23,509
Good, good.
So do I.

995
01:39:26,591 --> 01:39:29,458
Bye, Mr. Brown.
Good-bye.
