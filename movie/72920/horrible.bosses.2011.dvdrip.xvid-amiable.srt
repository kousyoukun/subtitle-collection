NICK:
Mm-hm.

445
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:15,270
Hypothetically, if we could do it and none
of us get caught, would you guys do it?

446
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,246
- No.
- I would.

447
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:18,779
- No, you wouldn't.
- I would.

448
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,211
-You would?
KURT: Yeah.

449
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,683
It's not murder if it's justified.
Justifiable homicide, right?

450
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,185
I can't wait to hear this.

451
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,052
If one evil person dies
for the greater good, so be it.

452
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:32,389
You know, Bobby Pellit is an absolute
monster. He's a fucking jerk.

453
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:36,897
If he has his way, he's gonna end up
killing thousands of innocent Bolivians.

454
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,090
What?

455
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,566
Technically, I think it's immoral
not to kill him.

456
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:43,639
I should kill Harken for not letting me
say goodbye to Gam Gam?

457
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,775
Yes. Yes, you should.

458
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,775
But I don't care how bad our bosses are.
We're not murderers.

459
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,437
Julia is ruining your life, you know?
That's wrong.

460
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:54,311
- That is wrong.
- It's affecting your possible marriage.

461
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:57,852
- Come on, she's not ruining it.
- Would your life be easier without Julia?

462
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,750
You're right.
Uh, know what I'm gonna do?

463
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:02,551
I'm gonna go to Julia's house,
maybe I'll slash her up...

464
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:06,321
...and I'll put her in a box and I'll mail it
to you two, uh, tough-guy mafiosos.

465
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:10,297
I'm done with this conversation. You're
paying for dinner because you've upset me.

466
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:13,994
You're paying
and I'm finding a cab somehow.

467
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,765
I was just speaking hypothetically,
you know.

468
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,669
Me too.

STACY:
Guess who.

470
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,575
Look, I'm really kind of
not in the mood for this.

471
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,308
Not in the mood for what?

Oh, what are you doing here?

474
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:34,681
JULIA: I invited her.
-Yes. She called.

475
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:39,261
And she said that now that we're engaged,
she wanted to offer me free dental work.

476
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,399
-And you know I have that loose filling.
DALE: Yeah.

477
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,556
This really was so, so sweet of you, Julia.

478
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,169
Oh, please. Come on, Stacy,
it's my pleasure.

479
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:48,827

Oh, why not?

483
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:05,586
Because we're mixing pleasure
with business. Business and pleasure.

484
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,348
We're taking advantage of Julia.

Dale.

486
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:13,461
There's nothing that you could do ever
that would be taking advantage of me.

- So sweet.

Do you hear the words you say sometimes?
I mean, who talks like that?

Let's have sex on top of her.
Let's use her like a bed.

Get down, get down. Hey, hey!
Get off of her.

So goodbye, I'm quitting. I'm done.

What?

511
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:19,324
If you don't fuck me,
I'm gonna tell her that you fucked me.

Okay. Tell her whatever the hell you want.
She's not gonna believe you.

She already knows
that you're a sex offender.

You said that killing is wrong.

She didn't get to say goodbye
to her grandson.

wouldn't let him leave. Right?

- She wouldn't want me to kill him.
