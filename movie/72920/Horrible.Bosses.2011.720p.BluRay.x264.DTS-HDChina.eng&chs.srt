Yeah. They don't write "hit man," right? That's dumb.
是啊 在网上不叫"职业杀手" 那不是找死嘛

630
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:24,472
- They use code words, like wet work, right? Liquidation.  - Check him out.

Your ad said you do wet work.
广告上说你做湿身行动

They don't, actually. I just hand the tools to Julia.
他们不放心 我只是递手术工具的

684

- 他妈不怪你怪谁  - 都是你的错 晚饭你请

- 就是警察  - 会查到你们的

870
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,226
We all have clear motives for killing our bosses...
我们都有明显的谋杀老板的动机...

871
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:08,393
so this is not gonna work. This is garbage.
所以这个行不通的 全是废话

872
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,063
I got it.
我懂了

873
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,138
Why don't you kill each other's bosses?
要不你们杀掉对方的老板?

874
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,473
- That's actually a good idea.  - It's not bad.
- 这的确是个好想法  - 想法不错

875
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:23,141
Yeah, like "Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train", right?
对啊 就像"火车怪客"里面一样 对吧?

876
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:26,220

- 我没看过 他们这么做的?  - Danny DeVito的电影 可搞笑了

- 原来它叫这个名字  - 这本我看过

Good movie. That's what you're thinking about.
电影不错 这才是你想要的

882
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:40,399
It's the same idea, though. We kill each other's bosses, there's no link to us.
这两个想法是一致的 我们杀掉对方的老板 就能洗掉嫌疑了

883
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,834
Exactly. Five thousand dollars well spent, right?
就是这样 五千美金花地很值 对吧?

884
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:45,303
- No, not at all.  - Waste of money.

为什么啊? 有什么区别? 他做老板又不会太长时间了

你有停车位吗? 我要取消你使用停车位的资格

00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,087
I'd get raped just as much as you would, Kurt.
我会被搞得和你一样惨的 Kurt

1151
00:57:34,249 --> 00:57:36,525
- Do you think you're more rape-able?  - I'm not saying that.
- 你觉得自己会被搞得更多?  - 我可没什么说

How cool was that?

1157
00:57:54,703 --> 00:57:57,479
It wasn't cool at all. We come out to gather information...
一点也不 我们是来这里收集情报的

1158
00:57:57,639 --> 00:58:00,916
and you start stabbing Harken to death in front of the neighborhood?
你却在大街上活活把Harken捅死了?

1159
00:58:01,076 --> 00:58:03,317

- 那个人就是Harken?  - 那你以为你捅的人是谁?

1160
00:58:03,478 --> 00:58:04,650
I wasn't stabbing anyone.

1161
00:58:04,813 --> 00:58:06,522
He had an allergic reaction to some peanuts

1162
00:58:06,522 --> 00:58:08,684
and I rescued him, know what I mean?

00:58:08,684 --> 00:58:10,686
He had a little allergy shot on him and I...
他身上带着小型的防过敏针筒 我就...

1164
00:58:10,886 --> 00:58:13,924

我就用那个针筒用力戳他 但我是在救他的命

- 救了那个人一命  - 等一下

1166
00:58:16,024 --> 00:58:18,595
So my boss, who we're thinking about planning to kill...
所以我老板 那个我们打算杀掉的人...

1167
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,263
is dying in front of you and you saved his life?
就要死在你面前了 而你去求了他一命?

1168
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,876
Well, that sounds bad when you say it like that.
你要是这么说的话 听起来的确蛮糟糕的

1169
00:58:24,032 --> 00:58:26,308
- Can you open the door?  - That's not cool.
- 你能开下车门吗?  - 这样一点也不地道

1170
00:58:26,468 --> 00:58:29,005
- But I didn't know it was Harken.  - Hit the button.
- 但我不知道他就是Harken  - 开车门吧

看吧 这就是为什么我需要知道我们要杀的人长什么样子

1172
00:58:31,606 --> 00:58:33,279
You're mad at me for killing him....
你刚刚还生我的气 以为我杀了他...

1173
00:58:33,442 --> 00:58:35,422
Can we give him a time-out? For one second.
你能把他锁外面吗? 就一会儿

1174
00:58:35,577 --> 00:58:37,818
Make up your fucking mind. It's like...
还用你他妈的脑子瞎编 就好像...

1175
00:58:37,979 --> 00:58:39,014
What is this?
这算是什么?

1176
00:58:39,181 --> 00:58:41,525
You gotta admit we got some good intel tonight.
你必须要承认 今天我们有搜集到很好的情报

1177
00:58:41,683 --> 00:58:45,096
Harken is allergic to peanuts and Pellit's got a huge stash of cocaine.
Harken对花生过敏 而Pellit有一大批可卡因

1178
00:58:45,253 --> 00:58:46,527
Are you playing this game? Really?
你们要玩这种游戏吗? 真的要玩?

1179
00:58:46,688 --> 00:58:50,864
So all we gotta do is to figure a way to get peanuts somewhere into Harken's house...
那我们要做的 就是想个办法把花生弄进Harken的房间

1180
00:58:51,026 --> 00:58:52,972
and put some poison in Pellit's coke.
然后在Pellit的毒品里面下点毒

1181
00:58:53,128 --> 00:58:56,268
It's easy for someone to think Pellit got a bad batch of cocaine.
别人很容易就会觉得 Pellit是死于劣质的可卡因

1182
00:58:56,431 --> 00:58:59,537
You seriously locking me out of the car like we're in 8th grade?
你们真的把我锁在车外面 好像我们才初中一样?

1183
00:58:59,701 --> 00:59:02,443
What about Harken? Probably always got that injector thing.
那Harken怎么办? 他可能随身携带注射器的

1184
00:59:02,604 --> 00:59:03,981
Doesn't shower with it.
洗澡总不会带吧

1185
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:06,449
So then we'll put some peanuts, or something, inside his shampoo, I guess.
所以我猜想 我们只要把花生什么的 放进他的沐浴露里面就行

1186
00:59:06,641 --> 00:59:09,315
That will be a couple of fatal accidents we're not even there for.
那就是一系列伪造的意外现场 我们甚至都不用现身

1187
00:59:09,478 --> 00:59:12,015
- Motherfucker Jones would be so proud.  - Yeah, he would.
- Motherfucker Jones会很骄傲的  - 是啊 他会的

1188
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:14,854
- Getting old.  - What do you do about dummy's boss?
- 岁月不等人啊  - 你准备怎么处理这傻子的老板?

1189
00:59:15,016 --> 00:59:17,656
I'll stake her out tomorrow and get to the bottom of it.
我明天会跟踪她 一直跟到晚上

1190
00:59:17,819 --> 00:59:20,698
- A man has his limits.  - That left a fucking dent.
- 人的忍耐可是有限度的  - 那一脚他妈可是要留下印子的

1191
00:59:23,091 --> 00:59:24,832
Get him fucking home.
他妈的把他送回家吧

1192
00:59:24,993 --> 00:59:29,066
Very funny. That was very funny, guys.
好有趣哦 这样真的好有趣哦 伙计们

1193
00:59:29,231 --> 00:59:31,734
Dale, we have one thing to figure out, if you can help us out.
Dale 我们还要弄清楚一件事情 如果你能帮我们理清楚的话

1194
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:35,279
If Nick and I were in prison, who do you think would get raped more?
如果Nick和我都去坐牢的话  谁会被强奸的次数会多一点?

1195
00:59:36,071 --> 00:59:37,311
Nick.
Nick啊

1196
00:59:37,472 --> 00:59:40,453
Really? Why?
真的吗? 为什么啊?

1197
00:59:40,675 --> 00:59:43,713
It's about weakness and vulnerability. It's not a looks thing.
这跟怯懦脆弱有关 不是相貌的问题

1198
00:59:43,879 --> 00:59:45,085
Good tell, it probably would be Nick.
说得没错 很可能是Nick多吧

1199
00:59:45,247 --> 00:59:48,490
Getting locked out of the car is bullshit, man.
被锁出车外面可真扯淡了 伙计们

1200
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,772
老鼠药

1201
01:00:32,861 --> 01:00:34,772
That's an awesome deal.
这促销太优惠了

1202
01:00:40,569 --> 01:00:43,641
Jesus, Dale. It's a murder, not a cocktail party.
天啊 Dale 这是去杀人 不是开鸡尾酒会啊

1203
01:00:43,805 --> 01:00:46,251
I know. You don't have to announce that to the world, okay?
我知道 你也用不着说给全世界听吧 行吗?

1204
01:00:46,408 --> 01:00:49,412
There was a great deal on nuts. I'm not gonna pass up on savings like that.
花生在搞特卖 我才不会错过这种省钱的机会

1205
01:00:49,578 --> 01:00:50,784
Okay, so this is it.
好了 就这么决定了

1206
01:00:50,946 --> 01:00:53,590
I'm doing Pellit, you're gonna do Harken,
我搞定Pellit 你搞定Harken
