2
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:37,434
I get to work before the sun comes up
and I leave long after it's gone down.

3
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:42,007
I haven't had sex in six months
with someone other than myself.

4
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,905
And the only thing in my refrigerator
is an old lime.

5
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,807
Could be a kiwi. No way to tell.

6
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,074
Morning, Thomas.
- Good morning, Nick. You better hurry.

7
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,774
But here's the thing:

8
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:53,578
This is just temporary.

9
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,013
Quick story:

10
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,920
My grandmother came to this country
with $20 in her pocket.

11
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:03,187
She worked hard her whole life
and never took shit from anyone.

12
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:08,630
When she died, she had
turned that $20 into $2000.

13
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,633
That sucks.

14
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,635
You know why she didn't succeed?

15
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:15,468
Because she didn't take shit
from anyone.

16
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:16,734
The key to success...

17
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,777
They will not teach you this
in business school... is taking shit.

18
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:24,378
That's what I've been doing the last
eight years, and it's all about to pay off.

19
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:25,575
This is Nick.

20
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:29,688
I'm this close to getting a big promotion
with my own office.

21
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,379
I'll be right there, Mr. Harken.

22
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:34,857
Then all the endless hours,
and the sacrifice and the shit-eating...

23
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,290
...will have been worth it.

24
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,260
See, this is what concerns me, Nick.

25
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:42,197
You're a punctual guy. You know
the importance of being here right at 6 a. m.

26
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:45,166
Which is what leads me to think that...

27
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:48,432
...there must be something wrong
with the clock on our system.

28
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,939
May have been a minute late.

29
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,602
But according to this, you were
two minutes late. So either you're a liar...

30
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,479
...or this system is off by a full minute.

31
00:01:58,651 --> 00:01:59,879
The only hitch?

32
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,283
I work for this guy, David Harken...

33
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:06,789
...who right now is giving me some
fresh shit for being two minutes late.

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,121
He's a total fucking asshole.

35
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:13,527
If that's the case, I'm gonna have to fire
Thomas, our longtime security coordinator.

36
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,964
- I may have been two minutes late.
- Oh.

37
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,769
Well, then you were Iying.

38
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,029
No. I... Who you calling?

39
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,840
- Thomas. I gotta let him go.
- No, uh...

40
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,305
- I was Iying. Sorry.
- Lying?

41
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:27,412
I didn't mean to. It was more of a saying.
"Might have been a minute late. "

42
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,142
Literally, uh, truthfully,
was two minutes late.

43
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:37,019
Boy, I have to get used to driving
with this big, heavy ring on my finger.

44
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,556
- Come on.
- I keep swerving to the left, babe.

45
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:43,093
When I was a kid, people would
ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up.

46
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,821
I always gave the same answer.

47
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,056
I love you so much.

48
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:47,723
I love you too.

49
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,232
I wanted to be a husband.

50
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,666
- I will call you when I'm done.
- Have a good day.

51
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,100
I know that sounds weird.

52
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,470
Most boys wanna be firehouse chiefs
or personal trainers...

53
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,908
...but to me being a husband
was, like, the highest calling.

54
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,205
And thanks to Stacy...

55
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,243
...that dream's about to come true.

56
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:07,910
Unfortunately, no one's gonna pay you
to be a husband unless you marry Oprah.

57
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:09,884
So I had to find a job.

58
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:12,251
Now, I always admired dentists.

59
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:15,394
They're smart, they're capable,
they keep your teeth healthy.

60
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,156
So I went out and I became one.

61
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:21,499
- How are you today, Dale?
- I'm fine. Thanks.

62
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:22,858
Excavator.

63
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,528
Okay, I became a dental assistant.
It's basically the same thing.

64
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,901
I just make a lot less money.

65
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,134
Did you ever see that show Gossip Girl?

66
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,176
- No.
- Ooh.

67
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,280
I watched an episode last night.

68
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:39,584
I fingered myself so hard to that
Penn Badgley guy, I broke a nail.

69
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,812
And it would have been
the perfect job. If not for one...

70
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:47,392
...evil crazy bitch, D.D.S.

71
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,696
I bet you're no shrimp in
the cock department, huh, there, Dale?

72
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,160
- Okay, Julia. Come on.
- What?

73
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,324
- I'm uncomfortable talking about that.
- Oh, Dale, come on.

74
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,934
You know that I like to fool around.

75
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,593
Oops.
- Mr. Anderton.

76
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,339
Not in the office. This is bad.

77
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:04,305
- Bad, bad, bad!
- You probably shouldn't hit the patients.

78
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,677
Ah, I love this. So festive.

79
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,007
I love my job.

80
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:12,982
If you ask me, anyone who hates their job
has no one to blame but themself.

81
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,620
We make our own destinies,
and I've made a sweet one.

82
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:18,188
We have stairs.
You don't need to bring your own.

83
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,226
I'm an account manager at a chemical
company. I'll tell you, the job has its perks.

84
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,419
Hi, can I help you?

85
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,928
He's just signing for these packages.
Thank you.

86
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,259
Oh, no. I should do this.

87
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,900
Reggie, I got this. Thank you, buddy.

88
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,536
- This is high-priority stuff here.
- Thank you.

89
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,296
- So, what's going on here?
- I'm sorry?

90
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,941
- Is this one of those hidden camera shows?
- What do you mean?

91
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,270
You're way too cute
to be just a FedEx girl.

92
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,004
You gotta be a model or actress
or something, right?

93
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,377
What happens when I open these?
Something'll jump out, bite my penis?

94
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,644
No. Nothing's gonna jump out.
I'm just a FedEx girl.

95
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,253
- Shut up.
- Ha, ha.

96
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,753
- Bye.
- Have a great afternoon.

97
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:51,947
Thank you.

98
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,923
I didn't sign that form, by the way,
so she has to come back.

99
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:56,118
She's cute, huh, Reg?

100
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,197
- Caught another fly in your web, did you?
- Ha, ha. Hey, Jack.

101
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:02,061
But the real reason I'm here is this guy:

102
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:05,568
Jack Pellit, my boss.
The sweetest man I know.

103
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,766
He loves me and I love him.
Everybody loves him.

104
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:11,466
- You all right, Margie?
- Hi, Mr. Pellit. Kurt.

105
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,737
I've been waiting to get in there
for a while.

106
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,313
- Who's in there?
- It's your son.

107
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,040
Bobby!

108
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,244
Margie's waiting.
You nearly done in there?

109
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,992
A man can't get any privacy around here.

110
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,752
- Okay, Margie. Bobby?
- What?

111
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,163
Your stomach okay? You seem
to spend more time on the toilet...

112
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,492
...than at your desk.

113
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,193
I didn't realize I had to tell you
every time I wanna take a dump.

114
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,498
If the worst thing about this job
is having to tolerate my boss's...

115
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,370
...dipshit cokehead son,
well, it's a small price to pay.

116
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,171
Need me to tell you when I pee-pee?

117
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,679
I'm just trying to get you to do
your part, son. It's not easy times.

118
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,181
I do my part. I do other people's parts.

119
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:56,288
But it doesn't matter to you. You just
wanna ride my ass because I'm your son.

120
00:05:56,456 --> 00:06:00,256
You know what? I don't hear you
giving dickskin any shit.

121
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,360
- "Dickskin"? Nice.
- Kiss-ass.

122
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,519
- Come on, come on.
Yeah, go on. In you go.

123
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,164
Get in the fucking...!

124
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,596
- I'm a green belt, motherfucker.
- What?

125
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,793
Yeah. All right?
- Okay.

126
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,201
Now, I know you've been working
your tail off for that promotion.

127
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,467
But I'm not sure I can even consider...

128
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:20,703
...making you the senior vice president
of sales...

129
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,148
...if I can't trust you.

130
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,381
- You can trust me.
- Yeah, now you sound like my wife.

131
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,215
"Trust me. You can trust me, honey.

132
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,620
Nothing's happening behind your back.
Trust me. "

133
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,761
Meanwhile, she's fucking
every guy in the neighborhood.

134
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,325
Oh, you want one?

135
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,063
It's 8:15 a. m.

136
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,761
Well, is there something wrong with
a man enjoying a drink in the morning?

137
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,538
No.

138
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,737
Thank you. Sure, thanks.

139
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,510
Bottoms up.

140
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,582
Nothing for you?

141
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,048
Nick, it's 8:15 in the morning.
I'm not an alcoholic.

142
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,917
The only reason I took one,
I thought you were gonna have one.

143
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:13,088
You took one because you thought I was?
Is that something a senior VP would do?

144
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,166
I was just trying to be polite.

145
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,996
So if I, uh, was gonna put my balls
in honey and shaved coconut...

146
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,195
...you'd do that too?

147
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,669
- I would not.
- Sure?

148
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,206
- Yeah.
- Because I've got some coconut.

149
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,938
I'm having my teeth whitened Tuesday. You
have to get your work done by Monday...

150
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,480
...which means you'll probably
be here all weekend.

151
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,050
Look, if you want a promotion,
you gotta earn it.

152
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,514
Now, what do I keep saying?

153
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,155
Life is a marathon,
and you cannot win a marathon...

154
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:40,588
...without putting a few Band-Aids
on your nipples, right?

155
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,318
Right.

156
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,554
Nick.

157
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,788
It's 18-year-old Scotch.

158
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,458
You don't really expect me to
pour it back into the bottle, do you?

159
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,543
- Water.
- Yep.

160
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,221
All right. Let's see if this thing's working.
Oh!

161
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:17,391
Oh, my God.
- Oh! I'm sorry. I'm a squirter, Dale.

162
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,295
- Oh, you know what?
- What?

163
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:25,665
Ah. I think I can make out
our little friend right there.

164
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,862
Stop it.

165
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,606
- Somebody's circumcised.
- Okay.

166
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,602
- Listen.
- What?

167
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:36,714
- Can we stop doing this thing here?
- Why? Because you have a girlfriend?

168
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,677
She's not just my girlfriend anymore.
We're engaged now.

169
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,685
- What?
- We're engaged.

170
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,954
You said that she was
just a hole for your dick.

171
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,060
I never said that.

172
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,456
Not really my style.

173
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:52,989
Shut up.

174
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,865
That's a lot of gas.

175
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,129
- That's good. No, those are great ideas.
- Yeah?

176
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,363
- Put them down on paper, will you?
- Will do.

177
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,178
- You're happy here, aren't you?
- Yeah, of course.

178
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,078
Good.

179
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,009
You got a bright future here,
you know?

180
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,115
Someday soon,
it'll be you running this place.

181
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:18,181
- See you, kid.
- All right, now.

182
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,189
- Drive safe.
- Yeah.

183
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:26,957
Oh, shit.

184
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,327
He had a heart attack.

185
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:33,271
They said his, uh, heart burst in his chest
like a water balloon.

186
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:37,265
Oh, my God. I'm sorry, man.
I know you guys were close.

187
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,911
Yeah. Yeah, I loved that guy.

188
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,276
I loved working for him, you know?
It was, like, awesome.

189
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:46,077
Now his shitbag son's
gonna be in charge and it's like...

190
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,276
The cokehead?

191
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:50,115
Yeah. Know how many times
I caught him doing blow at work?

192
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:54,453
This thing's a real bummer. Sorry. You're
the only one of us who didn't hate his job.

193
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:58,961
Did I tell you that Harken tricked me
into having a drink at 8:00 this morning?

194
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,758
I mean, I work for the Antichrist.

195
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,868
- How did he trick you?
- I thought he was giving you a promotion.

196
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,436
He is, definitely.
That's why he's being extra evil.

197
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,938
This is his last chance
to make my life miserable.

198
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,202
Right. At least your boss
isn't sexually harassing you.

199
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,175
- God. Here we go.
- Don't give me shit.

200
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,939
You won't get sympathy for this.

201
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,607
She's going crazy. It's like a totally
hostile work environment now, man.

202
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,218
- It's not funny.
- Yeah?

203
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:25,483
All right, today she starts spraying water
at my crotch to see the outline of my dick.

204
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,057
- That's great.
- It's not great.

205
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:30,218
What are you talking about?
Why don't you just, you know, fuck her?

206
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:34,025
Because I am engaged to be married
and I love my fiancée, okay?

207
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,224
That's true.

208
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,800
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

209
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,437
What about getting
a different dental hygienist job?

210
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:40,697
I can't get another job.

211
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,774
- No, he's a child molester, Nick.
- No, uh, deviant. Sexual deviant?

212
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,343
What is it? How do they classify it?
Sex offender.

213
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,309
I'm on the registered
sex offender list, yes.

214
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:53,209
You can't get that expunged? All you did
was pull your dick out on a playground.

215
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,650
I was taking a piss at night,
there were no kids.

216
00:10:55,821 --> 00:11:00,121
All right, you know what? You don't
put a playground right next to a bar.

217
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,816
- It's entrapment.
Mm-hm.

218
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,856
Speaking of entrapment, I'm gonna go
see that girl about her vagina.

219
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,633
Excuse me.

220
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,799
He did say 10:00, right?

221
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:18,938
- Yeah. Do you know what this is about?
- It just said "staff meeting" on the memo.

222
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:23,605
It's funny how he gets all over my ass if I'm
a minute late, but then he makes us wait 15.

223
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,478
- You were two minutes late.
Morning.

224
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,949
Didn't think I had to punch a clock
with you.

225
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,384
I'll just attribute this
to your drinking problem.

226
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:33,218
- I don't have...
- Please, we're in the middle of a meeting.

227
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:36,555
Morning, everyone.
So I have finally decided...

228
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:42,893
...who I want to be our new
senior vice president of sales.

229
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,303
He's right here in this room.

230
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,604
- It's me.
- What'd he say?

231
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:54,041
I've decided to absorb
the responsibilities...

232
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,875
...of the senior VP position
into my own.

233
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,644
I've realized if you wanna get something
done right, you gotta do it yourself.

234
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,984
I'll break through the wall of the office
that would have been the senior VP's...

235
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,284
...and make one huge, enormous office.

236
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:12,727
However, I will only be taking 85 percent
of the additional salary I am entitled to...

237
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,799
...and that is self-sacrifice, people.
Learn from it.

238
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,401
Fucker!

239
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,403
You fucking son of a bitch!

240
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,143
You are so fucking fired!

241
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,514
Yeah!

242
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,681
So, meeting adjourned.

243
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,187
- Can I speak to you?
- Sure, what is it?

244
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,294
For months you've been hinting
I was in line for that promotion.

245
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,430
And look how hard you've been working.

246
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,498
- You were just Iying to me?
- Lying?

247
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,159
No, Nick, motivating.

248
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,999
I mean, look, we're all
part of the same team here.

249
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:57,404
Plus, you know, I'm the one
who's gonna be doing all the extra work.

250
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,737
You know last month
you made me work so late...

251
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,574
...I missed saying goodbye
to my Gam Gam?

252
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,982
- Sorry, what?
- My grandmother.

253
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,780
I told you I needed to see her
because she was very sick.

254
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,819
You said if I left early, I'd get fired.

255
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,083
And she died
before I made it to the hospital.

256
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,055
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

257
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:21,661
I had no idea that you called
your grandmother "Gam Gam. "

258
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,635
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

259
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,975
I'm sorry you didn't get to
say bye-bye to Gam Gam.

260
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,543
Really, I really am. I'm sorry.

261
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:38,376
But I needed you to work late because you
are an invaluable member of this operation.

262
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,576
And I need you in the position you're in.

263
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,688
Well, tough shit, okay?

264
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:49,050
Been in that position for eight years. Why
would I stay after being treated like this?

265
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:53,255
Well, because I'd make sure that nobody
in the industry would ever hire you again.

266
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,558
Bullshit.

267
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:58,100
No, because they're gonna want
my letter of recommendation, right?

268
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:03,867
So I'm perfectly willing to write that
you are an insubordinate, dishonest drunk.

269
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,238
You can't do that. That's not true.

270
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:13,778
Let me tell you something,
you stupid little runt.

271
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,545
I own you.

272
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,154
You're my bitch.

273
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:20,349
Don't walk around thinking
you have free will because you don't.

274
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,892
I can crush you any time I want.

275
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:28,224
So settle in because you are here
for the long haul.

276
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,917
Yo, dickwall.

277
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,979
- What the fuck?
- What?

278
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:52,418
Three hours late. What's the deal?

279
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,988
- I was at your father's funeral.
- Uh-huh. Mm-hm.

280
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,119
Maybe that excuse would have flown when
my dad was here, but I'm in charge now.

281
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,062
That excuse wouldn't make any sense
if your dad was still here.

282
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,792
Whoa.

283
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,960
In my office, now.

284
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:10,732
Yes?

285
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,135
All right, sit.

286
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,802
- I'm not a dog, Bobby.
- Good boy.

287
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,211
I've been looking through the books.
You're the accountant. Tell me...

288
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,114
- ... why is this company in the crapper?
- Well, we're not.

289
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,051
- It's a recession, but we're still profitable.
- Bullshit.

290
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,656
Look...

291
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:29,853
...I know you and my dad were, uh, pals.
Okay?

292
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,896
Frankly, I always thought
it was a little bit weird and gay.

293
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,397
I have no idea why he thought
you were so fucking special.

294
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,829
But that doesn't matter now,
he's in the ground.

295
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,836
I'm your boss. And there's gonna be
some changes around here.

296
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,099
- Can't wait to hear them.
- First things first.

297
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,039
EnviroTech Waste Management.
It's costing us a lot of money.

298
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,645
Your dad chose to dispose
of our waste responsibly.

299
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,475
To do that, you gotta spend money.

300
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,482
Bolivians will do it for a third
of the price. I'll hire them.

301
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:54,914
- You can't go to them.
- Why?

302
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,055
They're gonna endanger
local residents.

303
00:15:57,222 --> 00:16:00,487
Oh, I give a fuck some tribesman
gets cancer. Cry me a fucking river.

304
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,490
They're not tribesmen.
It's a modern society.

305
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,060
Do I look like I fucking care?

306
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,697
Your dad told me very clearly
he would rather die...

307
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,730
...than save money
and hurt people, okay?

308
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:12,428
Well, guess what, looks like
we're right on schedule, doesn't it?

309
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,803
What else? Gotta trim
some of the fat around here.

310
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,068
What do you mean by "trim the fat"?

311
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,473
- I want you to fire the fat people.
- What?

312
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,171
They're lazy, and slow
and they make me sad to look at.

313
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:26,512
You can start with Large Marge.
Marge, can you come in here, please?

314
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,677
No, Margie's not fat, she's pregnant.
I'm not gonna fire her.

315
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,254
Well, fine. Uh...

316
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,914
...stay where you are, Marge.
Congratulations.

317
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,557
- You can fire, uh, Professor Xavier.
- Who are you talking about?

318
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,265
- You mean Hank?
- Yeah.

319
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,664
He creeps me out, rolling around
all day in his special secret chair.

320
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,862
- He's up to something.
- I won't fire anyone.

321
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,064
- You're not? Oh, really?
- Yeah, really.

322
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,675
It's like you don't care
about this company at all.

323
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,371
No fucking shit I don't care about
this company. This is just an ATM to me.

324
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:59,005
You think when I was a kid I dreamed
of running a fucking chemical company?

325
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:03,245
No. I dreamed of being on a beach
with a model serving me tropical drinks.

326
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,947
That's what I dreamed of.
That's what's gonna happen...

327
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:10,824
...as soon as I squeeze the profit out
of this company. But first things first.

328
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:15,060
You either fire the fatty or you
fire the cripple, or I fire all three of you.

329
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,535
Do the math.

330
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,103
One loses the job or three loses it.

331
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:24,067
And tell him to leave his handicap
parking pass here as well.

332
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,002
Come in.

333
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,506
Julia, you needed to see me?

334
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:31,876
Oh, shit.

335
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,647
Uh-oh.

336
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:42,516
- Will you have a seat, Dale?
- Do I have to?

337
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,519
Please.

338
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:47,863
Sure.

339
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,237
This is a little ridiculous, but...

340
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,002
Look, Dale, you know, I know that
I like to fool around at work. Right?

341
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:02,443
And I might even... You know,
I might even cross the line a bit.

342
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:06,243
But the last thing that I wanna do
is make you uncomfortable.

343
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:09,382
I mean, it's just not professional.
You know?

344
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,922
And I pride myself
on being a professional.

345
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:17,688
So from now on, what I would like you
to do is just tell me, you know...

346
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:21,196
...when and if, uh, I cross the line. Okay?

347
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,800
Okay. Now.

348
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,327
What?

349
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,996
Well, now,
you're kind of crossing a line...

350
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,241
...because you're naked.

351
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,934
Uh...

352
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,510
Not naked, Dale.

353
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,844
- Can you see my pussy?
- Hmm.

354
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,478
True. Um...

355
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:47,387
But I think, uh, even really
saying the word "pussy" is...

356
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,550
- That's crossing the line?
- Little bit.

357
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,821
You're starting to sound like
a little faggot.

358
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:55,694
There we go. That one's another one,
probably illegal thing to say too.

359
00:18:55,868 --> 00:19:00,931
Okay. Let's not talk about illegal,
Mr. I-Like-To-Pee-On-Little-Boys.

360
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:03,631
It was an empty playground
in the middle of the night.

361
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,209
Ah. That's weirder. Poor child
must have been terrified.

362
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,609
There were no children. No kids in the park.
Why do people think that?

363
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:13,979
You know what? Forget it. Listen,
let's just cut to the chase, all right, mister?

364
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,087
- You're engaged now.
- Right.

365
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:20,817
And I respect the institution of
marriage way too much to violate it.

366
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:25,028
So that's why you're gonna have to
fuck me well before the wedding.

367
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:29,931
Because the closer we get to this date,
the less ladylike I'm gonna feel about it.

368
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,433
Julia, I'm not gonna sleep with you.

369
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,003
We'll see about that.

370
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,847
Get out.

371
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,551
Could you do the, uh...?

372
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,791
I'm a sucker.
Harken wasn't gonna promote me.

373
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,655
That coked-up prick
is gonna ruin Pellit Chemicals.

374
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,692
He's just gonna fire everybody.

375
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,833
She stood there with her breasts
right in my face.

376
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,127
Yeah, you know,
yours doesn't sound that bad.

377
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,861
I'll stop bringing it up.

378
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,097
I don't understand
why you guys don't quit.

379
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:11,709
Julia's the only one who'd hire me.
Are you registered sex offenders?

380
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,779
Going to school, changing fields, starting
from the bottom. Who wants to do that?

381
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:19,907
What do I care about protecting
Pellit's name when his own son doesn't?

382
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:23,145
- Gotta be a million jobs out there.
- You could find another job.

383
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,756
- Is this really happening? Look at this.
Oh!

384
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:29,360
The Three Musketeers. Nick, Kurt and Dale.
Look, hanging like high school.

385
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,122
- Oh, shit. Kenny's here.
What's up?

386
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,422
- Yeah, I love this.
- Kenny Sommerfeld.

387
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,727
- In the flesh, boys.
Oh, my goodness.

388
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,394
Now, I heard you moved to New York,
you're working at Lehman Brothers.

389
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,268
- They, uh, hired me right out of Yale.
- What are you doing here?

390
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:46,741
- You read the papers? They shut us down.
Right. Sorry about that.

391
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,210
I've been looking for work
for the last two years.

392
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,406
I can't even get a job waiting tables.

393
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,914
Ah, you know what, though?

394
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,451
I would fucking murder those
Lehman Brothers if I could.

395
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:56,645
Yeah, I hear you.

396
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,722
Ha. I can't even pay
for this fucking drink.

397
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,255
Well, we'll cover it, right?

398
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,258
Seriously, uh, you guys think
you could help me out a little?

399
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,591
- Beyond the drink?
- Maybe some extra scratch, if you got it.

400
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,030
Of course. Kenny, I had no idea
it was that bad, buddy. All I got's 15.

401
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,534
- Do you have change for a 10?
No, I don't.

402
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:16,037
You know what? That's probably
not gonna cut it, so I'll tell you what.

403
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,073
How about I give you guys
some hand jobs?

404
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,835
- Do what?
Forty bucks apiece.

405
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,775
We could do it here in the bathroom.

406
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,142
- No thanks.
- That's a joke? You're joking?

407
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:25,374
- Kenny.
Hey!

408
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,017
Oh, shit.
- Come on, man.

409
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,846
I told you no more handies in here.

410
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,649
You guys change your minds,
I'm staying at my mom's house.

411
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:32,847
Okay.

412
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,121
Maybe don't quit your job.

413
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:41,495
I guess we'll be miserable
for the rest of our lives? That's the deal?

414
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,135
That's the way it's looking.
- Why you saying that?

415
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,930
We don't have many options, do we?

416
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,035
Think about it, we can quit our jobs
and turn into Kenny...

417
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:52,472
...or, uh, keep our jobs
and just become spineless losers...

418
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,841
...that spend their entire day
dreaming of ways to kill their bosses.

419
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,606
- You do that too?
- Of course.

420
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,911
- Sounds a little sick.
- It's not. It's just a way to blow off steam.

421
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,418
It's not like we're gonna
actually kill our bosses.

422
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:06,056
- Good.
- Ha, ha. Though you would have to admit...

423
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:09,284
...that our lives would be a lot easier
if our bosses weren't alive.

424
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:10,485
Mm-hm.

425
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:15,258
Hypothetically, if we could do it and none
of us get caught, would you guys do it?

426
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,234
- No.
- I would.

427
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:18,767
- No, you wouldn't.
- I would.

428
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,199
- You would?
Yeah.

429
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,671
It's not murder if it's justified.
Justifiable homicide, right?

430
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,173
I can't wait to hear this.

431
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,040
If one evil person dies
for the greater good, so be it.

432
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:32,377
You know, Bobby Pellit is an absolute
monster. He's a fucking jerk.

433
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:36,885
If he has his way, he's gonna end up
killing thousands of innocent Bolivians.

434
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,079
What?

435
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,554
Technically, I think it's immoral
not to kill him.

436
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:43,627
I should kill Harken for not letting me
say goodbye to Gam Gam?

437
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,763
Yes. Yes, you should.

438
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,764
But I don't care how bad our bosses are.
We're not murderers.

439
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,425
Julia is ruining your life, you know?
That's wrong.

440
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:54,299
- That is wrong.
- It's affecting your possible marriage.

441
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:57,840
- Come on, she's not ruining it.
- Would your life be easier without Julia?

442
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,738
You're right.
Uh, know what I'm gonna do?

443
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:02,539
I'm gonna go to Julia's house,
maybe I'll slash her up...

444
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:06,309
...and I'll put her in a box and I'll mail it
to you two, uh, tough-guy mafiosos.

445
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:10,285
I'm done with this conversation. You're
paying for dinner because you've upset me.

446
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:13,982
You're paying
and I'm finding a cab somehow.

447
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,753
I was just speaking hypothetically,
you know.

448
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,657
Me too.

449
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,795
Guess who.

450
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,563
Look, I'm really kind of
not in the mood for this.

451
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,296
Not in the mood for what?

452
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,732
- Hi.
- Hi, babe.

453
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,466
Oh, what are you doing here?

454
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:34,669
I invited her.
- Yes. She called.

455
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:39,249
And she said that now that we're engaged,
she wanted to offer me free dental work.

456
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,387
- And you know I have that loose filling.
Yeah.

457
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,545
This really was so, so sweet of you, Julia.

458
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,157
Oh, please. Come on, Stacy,
it's my pleasure.

459
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:48,815
You're part of the family now.

460
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:59,134
But, um, I don't know
if it's a good idea, sweetie.

461
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,033
Oh, why not?

462
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:05,575
Because we're mixing pleasure
with business. Business and pleasure.

463
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,336
We're taking advantage of Julia.

464
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,408
Dale.

465
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:13,449
There's nothing that you could do ever
that would be taking advantage of me.

466
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:16,418
- Okay?
- So sweet.

467
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,057
All right, you. Let's go say
we pump you full of gas, huh?

468
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,460
Okay.
- Okay.

469
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,831
Fuck me.

470
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,929
Ten.

471
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:30,766
Nine.

472
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,131
I don't know
what you're doing with your hand.

473
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,740
- Okay.
Seven.

474
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:40,435
Put your hand in a safe place
because there's sharp tools here.

475
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,038
Oh, there she goes.

476
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:46,214
Come here!
- What are you doing? What are you doing?

477
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:50,112
You're gonna give me that dong, Dale.

478
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,480
My dong?

479
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,590
You're gonna fuck my slutty little mouth.

480
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:56,955
Do you hear the words you say sometimes?
I mean, who talks like that?

481
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:59,688
Let's have sex on top of her.
Let's use her like a bed.

482
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,998
Get down, get down. Hey, hey!
Get off of her.

483
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:07,366
Goddamn you! That's it, okay?
You know what? That's crossing the line.

484
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,029
So I'm done, Julia.

485
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:12,802
Fuck this. I'm out. I don't need this job.
So goodbye, I'm quitting. I'm done.

486
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,605
I'm gonna tell her you fucked me.

487
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,371
What?

488
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:19,312
If you don't fuck me,
I'm gonna tell her that you fucked me.

489
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:22,984
Okay. Tell her whatever the hell you want.
She's not gonna believe you.

490
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,286
She already knows
that you're a sex offender.

491
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:29,693
And I think once she gets a look
at these...

492
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:32,463
...she's gonna believe me.

493
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,926
- What is that?
- Do you remember your first week here?

494
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,365
When I changed the crown
on your second bicuspid?

495
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,663
Yeah.

496
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:44,338
Well, I just, uh, took a few pictures
of the procedure.

497
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,409
Oh, my God.
- Right?

498
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,970
Oh, no. What?

499
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,441
Oh. Ooh.

500
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,380
You did all this
while I was unconscious?

501
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,453
Ooh. Mm-hm. Yep.

502
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,119
That's my favorite.

503
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,316
- Rape.
- What?

504
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,688
Rape. That's a rape.
This is what raping is.

505
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,422
You're a raper and you've raped me.
That's a rape! Rape!

506
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:09,032
Just relax there, Jodie Foster.

507
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:10,967
Your dick wasn't even hard.

508
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,865
That does not give me any relief.

509
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,734
But it will be next time, and if it is not...

510
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:20,435
...this little sweetheart right here is gonna
get a peek at my little photo album.

511
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:26,575
So please prep the patient
for the bitewing x-ray.

512
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:29,085
I'll be back in a jiffy.

513
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,157
I'm in. Let's kill this bitch!

514
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:46,665
What bitch?
- "What bitch"? Guys, my boss.

515
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:50,103
Our bosses need to die. You were right,
man. We should do this thing.

516
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,301
We were drinking last night.
You said that killing is wrong.

517
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:57,710
I know. That was before Julia tried to fuck
me on top of Stacy's unconscious body.

518
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:59,008
Really?
- Yes, dude.

519
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:02,551
She's gone fucking batshit crazy.
She took a bunch of photographs of me...

520
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:05,383
- Where are they?
- They'll ruin my life. I can't show them.

521
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:08,424
- It's a whole thing. You guys in or out?
- I was in last night.

522
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,618
- Nick, what do you say?
- Please. Let's go.

523
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:11,819
Nick, come on.

524
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:15,228
Seriously. I mean, uh, what about
your grandma, you know? Bubbe.

525
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,697
- Gam Gam.
Whatever it is.

526
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,961
She didn't get to say goodbye
to her grandson.

527
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,970
Because his dickbag of a boss
wouldn't let him leave. Right?

528
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,405
- What would Gam Gam want you to do?
- She wouldn't want me to kill him.

529
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,478
Okay, forget about Gam Gam.
She's dead. You gotta accept that.

530
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,480
This is about you, Nick.
Okay, what do you want?

531
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,542
Well, obviously I want him gone.

532
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:35,549
- Exactly. So let's do this.
- Right?

533
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,919
How do we do this?
- I thought about that.

534
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,057
Stacy and I,
we watch a ton of Law & Order.

535
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:43,285
There's all sorts of ways the bad
guys on the show mess up, right?

536
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:46,555
They leave behind skin cells
and, uh, bullet casing...

537
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:47,755
Sperm.

538
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:50,025
- Most of the time, it's sperm.
- Silent killer.

539
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,066
Anyway, that's not the point.
Point is...

540
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,705
...we're not qualified.
We gotta hire a professional.

541
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,738
- Are you talking about a hit man?
- Yeah.

542
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:58,603
That's a really good idea.

543
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,575
Yeah. We don't clean
our own apartments or cut our own hair.

544
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,338
- No, we pay someone to do that.
- Yeah.

545
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,415
Uh, where are you two
gonna find a hit man?

546
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,710
Why don't you guys
leave that up to me, okay?

547
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:10,150
I got this whole thing figured out.

548
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:14,815
I'm gonna give you a call tomorrow,
I'm gonna tell you where to meet me.

549
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,551
Why don't you just tell us now?

550
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,856
- Because I don't have it figured out.
- Ah.

551
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,458
But I will.

552
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:44,121
- Were you followed?
- Why would I be followed?

553
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:47,417
People follow people in these types
of situations. Sure you weren't?

554
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:48,616
Oh, boy. What people?

555
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:50,920
Just take one quick look around,
make sure.

556
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,496
- Let's put this down.
- Look around, make sure some...

557
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,394
- Calm down!
That's what you get.

558
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,831
Shut the door, take the chain off
and let me in.

559
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,902
- I pissed him off already.
- Already?

560
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,041
What the hell's going on, huh?
What are we doing here?

561
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:08,270
- I don't want an assassin in my apartment.
- Don't want this guy knowing where we live.

562
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:11,973
Hang on, you guys already went ahead
and found someone that's coming here?

563
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,414
- Oh, bigtime.
- Not "we. " Dale, all by himself.

564
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:18,248
- It was easy. Easy as buying a used futon.
- You found a hit man online?

565
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,857
Yeah. They don't write "hit man,"
right? That's dumb.

566
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:24,461
They use code words, like wet work,
right? Liquidation. Check him out.

567
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:26,893
"Skilled professional
with years of experience...

568
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,056
...in domestic and international
wet work.

569
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,327
Discreet. No children,
no political figures. "

570
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,438
That last part was important. I saw that,
I thought, "This is a good idea. "

571
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:37,865
I feel we should've got
a cheese plate for this guy.

572
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,270
-20/20 hindsight.
- Is that him?

573
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,140
Oh, shit.
- Yeah, that was definitely a car.

574
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:49,152
He looks like James Bond.
- He really does, dude.

575
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,279
Bet he carries a gun you screw together.
Those are, like, the coolest guns they make.

576
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,688
So dangerous.
What if that is an undercover cop?

577
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,384
- Come on.
- What if it's the real thing?

578
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:00,531
He charges so much we can't
afford it, gets pissed, kills us.

579
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,598
- Kills all three of us? Hold on.
- That's a thing?

580
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:03,791
Could that happen?

581
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,467
- Gotta let him in.
- How's my hair?

582
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,698
- What do you mean?
- It doesn't matter. Let's do this. Okay.

583
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,398
Ready?

584
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,643
Yeah?

585
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:20,975
Are you Dale?

586
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,888
- I am the one they call Dale.
- Hmm.

587
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,122
Please come in.

588
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:30,126
Thank you.

589
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,994
Are all three of you participating in this?

590
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,259
Yes.
Well, um...

591
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:39,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep. Yep.
Yes.

592
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,097
Very well.

593
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:43,968
Now, before we go any further...

594
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:47,600
...I need to know if there are
any hidden recording devices in the room.

595
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,713
I will find out if there are.

596
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:53,476
I'm sure you would, but there's none
because that would be stupid of us.

597
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:55,710
- That's a silly move.
- It's a no.

598
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,489
Then let's get started.

599
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,825
- I love this guy.
- This is the real deal.

600
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,986
- His voice, you kidding?
- This guy is legit.

601
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:09,429
And you do know that
we just wanna start with a...?

602
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,768
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, wait, what's this for?

603
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:14,370
- For the mess.
- What?

604
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,131
Wouldn't wanna leave a stain, now.

605
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,298
- Oh, my God. I knew it.
- Who's first?

606
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:20,808
- "Who's first"? No.
- We don't want you to kill us.

607
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:24,107
We want you to kill another person.
If anyone's first, probably him.

608
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:25,306
No. Goddamn it.

609
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:27,951
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
what are you talking about?

610
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:30,887
Your ad said you do wet work.

611
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:34,183
That's correct.
I urinate on other men for money.

612
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,891
- What was that?
- What'd he say?

613
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,687
I think he said he pisses on dudes.

614
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:41,491
Why else do you think my ad was
in the "men seeking men" section?

615
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:43,958
Where was it?

616
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:46,000
- You fucking idiot.
- Could you be dumber?

617
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,367
- Why look in the "men seeking men"...?
- We are men looking for a man!

618
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,474
How do people
let you work on their teeth?

619
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:54,111
They don't, actually.
I just hand the tools to Julia.

620
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:58,579
Are you telling me that I've driven all this
way and nobody wants to get pissed on?

621
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,240
Uh-uh.
- Well, it's not our thing.

622
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,442
Sorry about that.

623
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:04,952
Can I use your toilet? I stored up
rather a large amount of pee for this.

624
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:07,887
Sure. Yeah, it's right through there.
Knock yourself out.

625
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:10,892
Oh, and by the way,
I still will want my $200.

626
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:12,359
- Understandable.
We insist.

627
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,794
- Two hundred, huh? A bargain.
- To kill three people?

628
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:17,025
- I thought it was such a good deal.
- Dipshit.

629
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:20,762
- Reflects poorly on me that you're my friend.
- Hear what's going on in there?

630
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,338
That was almost all over us.

631
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,839
Okay, I'm gonna
take the blame on that one.

632
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:31,538
- You bet your ass you will.
- You should take the blame.

633
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:34,549
- It was an honest mistake.
- That's not how you find a killer.

634
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,244
- Oh, you know how to find a killer?
- Yeah, I bet I...

635
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:39,686
Yeah, hey, you know what?
Yeah. I got an idea.

636
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:40,949
What are you doing?

637
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,149
What are you doing?

638
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,261
Good evening, Mr. Buckman.

639
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,693
Thank you for contacting Nav Guide.
My name is Gregory.

640
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,593
How may I be of service this evening?

641
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:52,634
Yeah, we're looking for the most dangerous
bar in the city. Can you help us, please?

642
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,669
- We're going to dinner.
I'm sorry?

643
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:58,331
Looking for a bar filled with criminals.
Lowlife thugs, hard-core shitheads.

644
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,841
- What do you got for us?
- Let's go to a restaurant.

645
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:04,709
I'm afraid our listings
are not organized by danger, sir.

646
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:07,851
I see there's an Applebee's
three blocks from your location.

647
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,543
- Perfect.
No, not really helpful.

648
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,383
They're not the kind of shitheads
we need. Anything else?

649
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,422
I could direct you
to a neighborhood...

650
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,253
...with the greatest
number of carjackings.

651
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:19,225
- Now we're thinking outside the box.
- I wanna go to dinner.

652
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:20,887
- Love it.
That's probably right.

653
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:24,262
Very good, sir.
You may wish to lock your doors.

654
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,109
- This is worse than getting pissed on.
Shh.

655
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:35,268
- I'd rather be pissed on.
- Jesus.

656
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:38,142
You weren't kidding, Gregory.
This is, uh, a bad part of town.

657
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,614
You can stay on the line.
You're still there?

658
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:43,754
I'm still here, sir.
- Just keep, uh, keep us on the line.

659
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:47,254
I'm always curious about these things,
but is your real name Gregory?

660
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:51,521
Uh, no, sir. My real name is Atmanand.

661
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:52,993
How do you get Gregory from that?

662
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,496
Oh. Gregory was assigned to me...

663
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:58,157
- ... by Nav Guide.
- Why not let you use your real name?

664
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:01,533
They say many Americans
find our real names hard to pronounce.

665
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,674
I'm not gonna play
by their rules anymore.

666
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,866
From now on,
I'm gonna call you Ahmenan.

667
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,944
Atmanand.
- Ammenand.

668
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,909
- Atmanad.
Atmanand.

669
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,549
I'm gonna call you Gregory,
that name's a nightmare.

670
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,878
Hey, baby.
Oh, boy.

671
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,748
You hurt his feelings.
I didn't.

672
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,912
You have arrived at your destination, sir.

673
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:22,423
All right. Well, thanks, Gregory.
You're welcome.

674
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:31,232
All right. All right, here we go.

675
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,968
This is a really bad idea.
This is a great idea.

676
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:37,301
- Gonna yell "anybody here kill for money"?
- No.

677
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:39,705
- That's a terrible plan.
- Follow me. I got this.

678
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:42,277
- Where you going?
- I don't feel we should stay.

679
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,039
All right.

680
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,245
- Bowflex?
Shut up.

681
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:52,880
Ah.

682
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:55,250
My man.

683
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:59,789
Hey, uh, does anyone here
kill people for money?

684
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:01,454
- Kurt.
- The fuck you just say?

685
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:03,031
No, it's not a race thing.

686
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:06,500
Uh, I believe that society discriminates
and disenfranchises you folks.

687
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:07,865
"You folks"?
- Subtle.

688
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:11,634
Man, I'm a small-business owner.
Who the hell you calling disenfranchised?

689
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:13,936
Well, not you in particular,
in that instance.

690
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,876
- Oh, right. You mean all black people.
- Yes.

691
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:19,209
- I'm gonna be in the car.
Oh, a baseball bat.

692
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:22,546
Uh, I didn't mean to offend you.
I'm sorry if that's what happened.

693
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,551
My heart's in the right place.

694
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:27,282
In five seconds, your heart
gonna be in the wrong place.

695
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:30,120
- Four, three, two, let's roll.
- Got it. Okay. Take care.

696
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,921
Have a nice day. Good day to you.

697
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,859
Bye, baby.

698
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,798
Don't say a word. I know, I know.

699
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,562
Hit the button. Hit the button.

700
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,865
- Guys, I don't know. Should we quit?
- Yeah, definitely.

701
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,634
- Yo. Think I can help you boys.
- Is that for us?

702
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:49,336
- Here we go.
- Not interested, thank you.

703
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:50,538
Hey, hey, hey.

704
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,043
Let's follow a strange guy
into a dark corner.

705
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:02,749
Somebody said y'all looking
for somebody to help with business.

706
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:06,124
- Yep.
- Well, um...

707
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,026
- ... are you a businessman?
- Yeah.

708
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,666
Motherfucker Jones.

709
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:13,566
- How's that?
- Motherfucker Jones.

710
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:16,705
Your first name is "Motherfucker"?

711
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,933
Last name Jones.
You got a problem with that?

712
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:23,604
No. No. Cool name. Yeah. Is that,
like, on your birth certificate too?

713
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,112
No, goofball.

714
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,344
My real name is Dean.

715
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,214
Dean Jones. Same name of
the actor in Herbie, the Love Bug.

716
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:31,582
He won't know who that is.

717
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,781
- I know who he is, bitch.
- Sorry.

718
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:37,553
I can't walk around in this fucking
neighborhood with that Disney-ass name.

719
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,589
How'd you get the name
Motherfucker?

720
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,891
When I was a kid, I snuck
into my mother's bedroom.

721
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:43,294
Ooh.
Uh-oh.

722
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:44,866
- She was laying there naked.
- Dean.

723
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,765
- She had been drinking all night.
- We get it.

724
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:50,066
And then I snuck up behind her,
and then I slipped my fingers...

725
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,942
- ... into her purse.
- Purse? He said "purse. "

726
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:57,171
I took her money, the whole week's
pay. I really fucked her over.

727
00:36:57,348 --> 00:37:00,647
And that's how I got the name
Motherfucker Jones.

728
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:01,842
Right.

729
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,988
They should call you Motherfucker-Over
Jones to avoid confusion.

730
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,283
- What's the confusion?
- There's no confusion.

731
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:10,586
We're gonna get back on track here.
Sir, we each have a boss, uh...

732
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:11,785
...that, you know...

733
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:15,899
There's three bosses, and it would be best
if those bosses maybe were no longer...

734
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,227
- No longer around anymore.
We want them...

735
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,496
You know?
- ... killed.

736
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:23,632
You got the cheese?

737
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:27,839
We got the cheese.
What kind of cheese are you thinking?

738
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,708
- What is that, three hits? That's...
- Yeah.

739
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:35,281
- Thirty large.
Whoa.

740
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,648
- Hungry.
- That's a lot of cheese.

741
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:38,948
Oh, here's an idea.

742
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:41,887
If you kill two, could we get
the third one hold the cheese?

743
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:45,256
It's no negotiations.
Thirty large or nothing.

744
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,865
- That's more cheese than we've got.
- Okay, then. It's five large now.

745
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:54,360
Then we're in. We're in. We're in. Right?

746
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:57,632
Hang on. Wouldn't it be awful
if it was traceable back to us?

747
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:59,173
I don't even know your names.

748
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:01,243
- That is rude. This is Dale.
- Don't say my name.

749
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:05,280
Shut the fuck up. Listen. Bring the money
here tomorrow, I'll take care of the rest.

750
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:08,316
Do you want it in something specific,
a shoebox, duffel bag?

751
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:10,886
- Just be here with the fucking money.
Yeah.

752
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:13,421
- Put it in a briefcase.
Thanks for your time.

753
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:14,615
Here we go.

754
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,783
Is the briefcase coming out of your end?

755
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:54,551
Looks like it's all there.

756
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,091
Didn't even need a briefcase.
It's a small stack.

757
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:59,957
- We should have used a manila envelope.
- It's all right.

758
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:03,999
What is your projected outside date
of completion, Motherfucker?

759
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:07,093
Ah.

760
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:11,230
I just got back from doing a dime
for some real nasty shit.

761
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:12,975
- That's 10 years.
- I know.

762
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:16,238
They're looking at me. I'm on probation,
and if I step out of line...

763
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:19,340
...I'm going back.

764
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,245
- Right.
- Understood.

765
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:25,613
- Period? End of story?
- What does that mean?

766
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:29,248
- Wait. You said you'd take care of this.
- Yeah, I'll take care of it.

767
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:33,863
I'm gonna be your murder consultant.

768
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,759
I'm sorry, but, uh...

769
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:41,633
- No, man. Right? That's not cool.
- You don't shut this fucking hamster up...

770
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:43,865
- Don't call me a hamster now. Come on.
- Easy, easy.

771
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:46,271
- It's just upsetting.
- No, it's somewhat accurate.

772
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,503
Look, that is not what we talked about,
Motherfucker.

773
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:51,648
So how about we just take the money
and we'll get out of here?

774
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:53,807
How about you go fuck yourself?
No refunds.

775
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:57,681
That's $5000. If you think we're just gonna
walk out and let you keep that...

776
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:00,483
- I think you're forgetting...
Don't go grabbing quickly.

777
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:01,682
Jesus.

778
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:05,226
Mr. Motherfucker, please,
don't shoot us. Let's just talk it out.

779
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,660
Listen, $5000 is mine.
I don't care what you say.

780
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:10,198
You can take my advice
or get the fuck out of here.

781
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,528
- That's a terrible deal.
We should listen.

782
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:14,637
- Okay, $5000 worth of advice?
Yeah.

783
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,238
Most killers are first-timers.

784
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:19,934
You wanna pull off a brilliant murder,
you gotta act like it's an accident.

785
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:23,170
Failed brakes, gas leaks, suicide.

786
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:26,407
You do it right, you ain't even
gotta be there when it goes down.

787
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:29,144
Oh, boy. That's five grand worth, huh?

788
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:32,322
- Pretty pedestrian.
- Not really. Obvious information, isn't it?

789
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,789
Sounds like Scooby-Doo. How are we
supposed to fake three accidents?

790
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,018
You stalk your prey.

791
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:41,358
Gotta be smart. Find out where they live,
find out their habits. What's their hobbies?

792
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:44,296
What they like, what food they like,
who they fucking.

793
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:46,163
- Word.
- Find them vulnerable.

794
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,773
I have a job, you know?
What's that, surveillance and recon?

795
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,569
That's why we were hiring, because
we wanna sub that out. We have jobs.

796
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:56,304
Even if you pull it off perfectly...

797
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:59,047
...if you crackers got motives...

798
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:00,240
...the popo...

799
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,442
- That's police.
- ... will pin it to you.

800
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,214
We all have clear motives
for killing our bosses...

801
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:08,381
...so this is not gonna work.
This is garbage.

802
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,051
I got it.

803
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,126
Why don't you kill each other's bosses?

804
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,462
- That's actually a good idea.
- It's not bad.

805
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:23,129
Yeah, like Hitchcock's
Strangers on a Train, right?

806
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:26,208
- I didn't see that. They do that?
- Danny DeVito movie. It's funny.

807
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,938
That famous Alfred Hitchcock, Danny
DeVito movie. That's the one he's...

808
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:32,378
Come on. You're thinking of
Throw Momma From the Train.

809
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,609
- That's what it is.
- That I saw.

810
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:36,878
Good movie.
That's what you're thinking about.

811
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:40,387
Same idea, though. We kill
each other's bosses, there's no link to us.

812
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,822
Exactly. Five thousand dollars
well spent, right?

813
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:45,291
No. Not at all.
Waste of money.

814
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,123
Well, too fucking bad.

815
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:48,560
Get out.

816
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:53,393
Hello.

817
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,506
Hey. I'm outside.
You ready to do a little recon?

818
00:42:56,674 --> 00:43:01,008
Yep. Yeah. I have to get Harken
to let me leave a little bit early.

819
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:04,147
What's the difference? Not like
he'll be your boss much longer.

820
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:05,914
I'll be down in three minutes.

821
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,847
Three minutes it is. Bye.
He'll be down in three minutes.

822
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:13,581
- Dude, these seats are crazy comfortable.
- Look at this. I know, it's so good. Ah.

823
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:17,119
The worst report I have ever read
in my life, you nimwit.

824
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:19,023
You're such a fucking dweeb.

825
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:23,864
Do you have a parking space?
Because I'm gonna take it away from you.

826
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:27,094
Who is it, like your mother-in-law
that knows my wife?

827
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,364
How you got this fucking job,
I don't even understand.

828
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:35,777
Ugh.

829
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:37,946
What the hell?

830
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:42,245
Sorry, everybody. I've been fighting
that bug all day. Let me get back to work.

831
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:46,287
No, no, no. You're disgusting. Go home.
I don't want you getting anyone else sick.

832
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,186
Probably best.

833
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:52,452
Take all your work with you
and have it on my desk 6 a. m. Monday.

834
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,121
- You got it. Thank you, Mr. Harken.
- Jesus Christ.

835
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:58,530
- Don't forget to take your fucking trash can.
- Yeah. No, that's mine.

836
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:01,102
You goddamn barfing pig.

837
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,034
Evens are over here.

838
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:10,408
I know, but sometimes on some
streets evens are on the opposite side.

839
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:11,605
Never.

840
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:14,046
Never have and they never will.
There it is, 428.

841
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:16,778
Which one, which one?
- Don't stop right in front of it.

842
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:19,718
Stop right here. Right here, right here.

843
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:23,324
Okay, boys.

844
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:28,158
We wait till Pellit makes a move,
then we tail him, all right?

845
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,924
- It is on like Donkey Kong.
- Ha, ha.

846
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,728
- Hells yeah, man.
- Here we go, huh?

847
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:34,803
I'm fucking pumped.

848
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,636
Oh, my God. This sucks.

849
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,135
This is horrible, man.

850
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:45,339
Are we even sure this guy's home?

851
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:53,446
- Let's go check this out.
- Yeah, we should probably look, right?

852
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:56,382
Shh.

853
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,652
Oh, my God.

854
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:59,625
What do you wanna do?
What's the plan?

855
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:03,426
- Let's look through this window right here.
- No, no. No, let's ring the bell.

856
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,694
You're not gonna ring the bell.
Look through the window right here.

857
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,135
Chances are, he's not home.
I haven't seen any activity in this house...

858
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:13,276
What are you doing?
You're not gonna ring the doorbell.

859
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:20,283
Whoo-hoo!

860
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,012
- Come on. Come on.
Dale, Dale, Dale.

861
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:31,761
I didn't make it in.

862
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:38,190
I'm sorry, guys. Didn't make it in.

863
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:39,460
You in?

864
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:43,094
Yeah, I'm okay. Jesus Christ,
the guy owns a fucking bear?

865
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,001
- We're breaking and entering here.
- I know. Shh. Oh, look at this.

866
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,709
Look at this place. It's awful.
It's like a douchebag museum.

867
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:54,980
It's like we stepped inside
the mind of an asshole.

868
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:57,615
Shit. He's got a foosball table.

869
00:45:57,788 --> 00:46:00,518
Dale! Don't touch anything.
Get your hands off that.

870
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:02,986
- Fingerprints.
- Yeah, fingerprints.

871
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,459
- God. We should be wearing gloves.
We don't have... Oh, here. I know.

872
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,495
Use your sleeves. Use your sleeves.

873
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:10,360
- For what?
- Use them for gloves.

874
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:13,469
- Come on.
- I can see my fingerprints from here.

875
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:16,606
- What do we do? What's the plan?
- We're here to get some intel.

876
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,639
- "Intel"?
- It's short for "intelligence. "

877
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,334
- I know what it stands for.
- Then why did you ask?

878
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:23,876
Why are we talking
about this? Let's split up.

879
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:27,813
In and out, in and out. We'll find something
good, and we're in and out of here.

880
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:31,614
Stop chatting and start looking.
- We're committing a crime. This is a crime.

881
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:33,613
Whoa.

882
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,495
- Nick.
Yeah?

883
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:42,189
- Now, this would count as intel, right?
- Holy shit, that's a lot of cocaine.

884
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,231
Have you ever seen this much cocaine?

885
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:46,528
That's gotta be worth,
what, 10, 15,000...?

886
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:51,304
Oh, I blew it. I blew that, didn't I?

887
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,400
Hmm.

888
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,951
Don't inhale.
- Grab the box. I'll scoop it in.

889
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:11,890
I really don't wanna touch it.
I don't have sleeve-gloves.

890
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:14,394
Get something to... Ugh. I'll scoop it in.

891
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:15,793
So bitter.

892
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:25,202
Hmm.

893
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:35,580
In the butt you go, go, go.

894
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:39,149
There you go.

895
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,380
Big scoop.

896
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,616
All right, let me try this. Look out.

897
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:44,727
- Yeah, that better work.
- Watch out.

898
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,087
There you go.

899
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:48,595
I don't know.
Go slow.

900
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:52,292
Get on the couch. Stop helping.

901
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,765
All right.

902
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:02,343
In you go.

903
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:05,774
Ooh.

904
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:15,485
You probably should have
emptied the DustBuster first.

905
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:20,554
Is that what you think?

906
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:23,164
I was thinking that.
On account of the dust.

907
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:29,096
Well, I've heard of butt floss,
but this is ridiculous. Ha, ha.

908
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:30,968
- Get a sifter, or a...
- Colander.

909
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,166
Colander would be good.

910
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,401
And I'll start picking.

911
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,742
That'll do.

912
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:48,847
I feel like everything'll work out.
I'm like a machine. Look how fast I am.

913
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:51,290
I'm moving super fast.
I can't even feel my nose.

914
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:53,725
Wanna know what's weird?
I should be panicking...

915
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:56,263
...and I am a little,
but it's in a very good way.

916
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:59,197
It's a good kind of panic
because I feel like I wanna die...

917
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,633
- ... but I also feel very, very, very good.
- Yeah.

918
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:03,705
Hey! What are you guys doing?

919
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:06,468
Nothing. But before we go,
I wanna take one more dump.

920
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:09,806
Take a dump and I'm gonna
do push-ups. Because I gotta get fit.

921
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,211
What the hell have you guys done?

922
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,414
I'm feeling good, dude.
Wanna help me clean?

923
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:17,576
We bond over this.
This is friendship stuff.

924
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:21,212
We broke into someone's house.
It's the most amazing experience of my life.

925
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:25,259
We broke into a man's house. Suddenly,
I'm like an expert at sifting cocaine.

926
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,522
It's amazing.
Come here and help me with this.

927
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,390
Can't believe we weren't prepared.

928
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:31,898
That was completely dangerous,
a total waste of time.

929
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:35,470
Well, no. Actually, not a total waste
of time. Look what I got.

930
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,004
- Not bad, huh?
- What is that?

931
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:39,074
- Is this his phone?
That's his phone.

932
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:40,675
- You steal this?
I sure did.

933
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:43,210
- It's got his contacts, schedule.
- Very nice.

934
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,677
- No.
- What do you mean, "no"?

935
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:47,874
That's a crime. Pfft. Nope. Ha.
No one said we'd be stealing.

936
00:49:48,051 --> 00:49:50,713
- This is a good grab.
- We broke in! You guys did cocaine!

937
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:53,822
- Right. Two... Three crimes.
- He's all jitzed out. Ignore him.

938
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,789
We're in the process of
getting ready to kill three people...

939
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,360
...and you're giving me shit
about stealing a phone?

940
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:01,588
Run it by me
if you'll be stealing stuff.

941
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:03,164
- Run it by you?
- Run it by me!

942
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,427
- Nick, will you hold this for a second?
- What are you doing?

943
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:09,003
"Run"? I'm not gonna run
anything by you.

944
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,572
I'm not gonna run anything by you.
Dickhead.

945
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:14,336
- There's a lot of stuff in here.
- I know.

946
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:17,639
- Wanna go check out your boss now?
- Yeah, I guess we should.

947
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:21,574
- You don't punch the driver!
- You don't punch the fucking driver.

948
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:25,188
I'm coked out of my fucking brain.
I'll punch whoever the fuck I want to.

949
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:43,462
Let's do this, guys. Feeling good.

950
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,302
- Be very quiet out there.
- Calm down, Dale.

951
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:48,205
You know what? Hang on a second.

952
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:52,280
Dale? Dude, hold it. Last time the three
of us did this, it was very messy.

953
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:54,713
- It was awesome, exciting.
- It was clunky as hell.

954
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:58,877
Here's what we'll do. In the event that
Harken is not here, just me and Kurt go in.

955
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,490
You'll stay out here, not go in,
and be our lookout.

956
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:04,650
What? Are you kidding me?
That's awesome. I love that. The lookout.

957
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:06,955
- I don't know what the guy looks like.
- Doesn't matter.

958
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:10,258
You see anybody, just assume
that it's Harken, send us a signal.

959
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:12,095
- Okay? Have a seat.
- Okay.

960
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:15,898
Okay. Send a sig...
I'm gonna honk the horn six times.

961
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,700
- Goddamn it. No.
- Did he say "six"?

962
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:20,240
- Something much more subtle.
- That's too many.

963
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,844
- More subtle? Four honks?
- Can you honk once?

964
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:24,480
- Are you kidding?
- Not at all.

965
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:27,082
People honk once all the time.
You'll be in and out...

966
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,310
- We'll know it's you.
- Come on, man. Dale, two honks.

967
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:33,684
That kind of tone's gonna get you nowhere.
All right, two honks.

968
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:36,519
- Just two honks. A little tap, tap.
- Okay.

969
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:41,130
Two very long, very slow honks.

970
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,365
- I'm gonna check this window over here.
- Okay.

971
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:54,200
There's nothing on that side.
- Yeah. I don't think there's anyone in there.

972
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:57,178
I think he's definitely out.

973
00:51:57,714 --> 00:51:59,545
Maybe we can find a way in upstairs.

974
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:03,143
Yeah, or maybe there's a window open.

975
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:09,025
Or better yet...

976
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,116
That makes things easier, huh?

977
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,387
I like the way you think. Move.

978
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:15,497
- No, don't do that. Hey! God!
- Oh, shit.

979
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:17,056
I broke a rock.

980
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:19,862
Please tell me you realize
that was a key thingy.

981
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:23,062
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

982
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,470
You weren't gonna
throw a rock through the door?

983
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,633
No, of course not.
No, I wanted to open it.

984
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,041
Like a real cat burglar.

985
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:34,283
Wow.

986
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:36,711
Just recon, now, okay?

987
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:40,379
Hey, take this. I don't want it.
I want my hands free.

988
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:42,354
You broke it.

989
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:49,923
I feel the intel...

990
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:52,791
God!
- Okay, just a cat.

991
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:53,993
Out of nowhere.

992
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,698
Just a cat. We're all right.
Let's look upstairs. Come on.

993
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:00,209
They call me hell

994
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:01,639
They call me Stacey

995
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,938
That's not my name
That's not my name

996
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:07,015
That's not my name
That's not my name

997
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,310
They call me hell

998
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:09,645
They call me her

999
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,116
They call me hell

1000
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:12,550
They call me Stacey

1001
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:15,384
That's not my name
That's not my name

1002
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:27,097
Oh! Goddamn it.

1003
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:28,931
Jesus, how many cats do they have?

1004
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:31,232
- It's the same one, I think. Yeah.
- Really?

1005
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:33,741
Quick little bugger, huh?

1006
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:34,934
Hey.

1007
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:37,602
- Shit, is that Harken's wife?
Yeah, that's her.

1008
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:40,079
- Oh, man, she is hot.
- She sure is. Here we go.

1009
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,344
I'd like to bend her over a barrel
and show her the 50 states.

1010
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:46,383
- I don't know what that means.
- Ah, it's a saying.

1011
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:49,992
- I don't think so.
- No, it is, it is. Yeah. No, people say that.

1012
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,924
- I haven't heard it.
- I've definitely heard people say that.

1013
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:55,291
I'm not gonna argue.
Let's continue the recon.

1014
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:58,366
Well, it's definitely a phrase.
- It sure isn't.

1015
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:01,732
Yeah, it is. It's from a book.
The Great Gatsby, maybe?

1016
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:05,705
Let's just look for an address book
or a day planner or something. You know?

1017
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:09,811
You know, it's too bad we're not looking
for cats. These people fucking love cats.

1018
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,124
Hey, schmuckface.

1019
00:54:36,238 --> 00:54:40,641
You wanna tell me what you're doing
littering on my street?

1020
00:54:40,809 --> 00:54:44,267
I think what happened, ahem, was that
the wind blew it out of my hand.

1021
00:54:44,446 --> 00:54:46,778
I don't care if the wind
blew it out of your twat.

1022
00:54:46,949 --> 00:54:51,113
Why don't you take this piece-of-shit car
and get off my fucking block.

1023
00:54:51,286 --> 00:54:55,120
I don't know why you're mad at the car.
I don't think we should get hostile now.

1024
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:57,121
"Hostile"? You wanna see hostile?

1025
00:54:57,292 --> 00:54:58,987
How about I go in my house
and I get my...?

1026
00:55:00,362 --> 00:55:01,829
What are...?
What's going on with you?

1027
00:55:03,065 --> 00:55:04,532
Peanuts.

1028
00:55:04,733 --> 00:55:06,462
"Penis"?

1029
00:55:07,102 --> 00:55:08,501
Oh, peanuts.

1030
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:11,833
That was a peanut butter sandwich.
Are you not good with peanuts?

1031
00:55:12,007 --> 00:55:14,840
What are you pointing at?
What's going on? What's here?

1032
00:55:15,344 --> 00:55:17,335
Oh, I got it! What do I do? What do I do?

1033
00:55:17,813 --> 00:55:21,146
"Check the needle, pump back, pump... "
Okay, hold on. I'm a slow reader.

1034
00:55:21,316 --> 00:55:22,806
"Hold the pump... " Okay, okay!

1035
00:55:22,985 --> 00:55:25,510
Jab it in your chest. Okay.
I got you, dude. Ready?

1036
00:55:30,025 --> 00:55:31,219
How you feeling, you good?

1037
00:55:31,393 --> 00:55:33,691
You good? Did I get you? Did I get you?

1038
00:55:36,899 --> 00:55:40,096
Whoa. Whoa. Dude, come here. Hurry.

1039
00:55:40,269 --> 00:55:41,793
Look at this.

1040
00:55:44,206 --> 00:55:46,834
- Is that Harken? Dale's killing Harken?
- That's Harken?

1041
00:55:47,009 --> 00:55:48,840
I'm gonna hit you again, okay?

1042
00:55:49,878 --> 00:55:51,778
What is he doing?
- He's really doing it?

1043
00:55:51,947 --> 00:55:54,245
- This is the recon stage.
- Holy shit.

1044
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:57,044
We gotta get out of here.
Come on, we gotta go. Oh, God.

1045
00:56:00,222 --> 00:56:01,314
I'm pushing on it. Okay.

1046
00:56:02,691 --> 00:56:05,285
What about little jabs? Little jabs?

1047
00:56:05,494 --> 00:56:06,722
Do I get your neck?

1048
00:56:08,764 --> 00:56:10,288
Was that good?

1049
00:56:13,502 --> 00:56:15,129
Come on, man!

1050
00:56:15,304 --> 00:56:16,328
Oh, my God.

1051
00:56:16,572 --> 00:56:17,766
Hey, hey! Come here!

1052
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:21,307
What's going on? What are you doing?
What's happened?

1053
00:56:21,476 --> 00:56:24,036
I think he's okay! I hit him
with this. Do you know him?

1054
00:56:24,212 --> 00:56:27,670
Of course, he's my husband. Sweetie?
Honey? Sweetheart, are you okay?

1055
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,981
- There he is. Hey.
- Ah. What did you do to me?

1056
00:56:33,155 --> 00:56:36,124
I saved you with your thingy.
It was incredible.

1057
00:56:36,291 --> 00:56:38,657
Oh, my God, sweetie.
He saved your life.

1058
00:56:38,827 --> 00:56:39,885
You saved his life.

1059
00:56:40,729 --> 00:56:42,287
Okay. That's cool.

1060
00:56:42,464 --> 00:56:44,489
- What's with the hugging?
- Saved your life!

1061
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:49,160
Oh, sweetie, I am just so grateful
that he was here. You could have died.

1062
00:56:49,338 --> 00:56:51,670
- I'm sure you are grateful he's here.
Yes, I am.

1063
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,637
- You know this guy?
- No, I don't.

1064
00:56:53,809 --> 00:56:57,142
Are you fucking this guy? What were
you doing, waiting to fuck my wife?

1065
00:56:57,312 --> 00:57:00,042
Dude, I just met your wife.
You want your thing back?

1066
00:57:02,217 --> 00:57:04,082
- You better get out of here.
- No problem.

1067
00:57:04,252 --> 00:57:06,413
Dave. Dave, what are you...? Honey?

1068
00:57:06,588 --> 00:57:10,354
Honey, you should be thanking this young
man. Why are you being so suspicious?

1069
00:57:10,525 --> 00:57:12,356
Why? You know why I'm being suspicious.

1070
00:57:12,527 --> 00:57:13,994
Because I know you sleep
around on me.

1071
00:57:15,364 --> 00:57:16,388
That's ridiculous.

1072
00:57:16,565 --> 00:57:18,192
What about the way
you look at Maurilio?

1073
00:57:20,435 --> 00:57:23,336
You realize we're all going to jail
because of that idiot?

1074
00:57:23,505 --> 00:57:26,531
Man, I can't go to jail. Look at me.
I'll get raped like crazy.

1075
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:27,936
Fuck, me too.

1076
00:57:29,211 --> 00:57:30,940
Yeah, totally.

1077
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,075
I'd get raped just as much
as you would, Kurt.

1078
00:57:34,249 --> 00:57:36,513
- Do you think you're more rape-able?
- I'm not saying that.

1079
00:57:37,886 --> 00:57:40,047
- You're pretty close to saying...
- Oh, fuck.

1080
00:57:46,828 --> 00:57:49,319
Holy shit.
Did you guys see me out there?

1081
00:57:49,498 --> 00:57:50,965
Yeah, we saw you, Dale.

1082
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:53,101
Shh. Yeah, we saw that.

1083
00:57:53,268 --> 00:57:54,530
How cool was that?

1084
00:57:54,703 --> 00:57:57,467
It wasn't cool at all.
We come out to gather information...

1085
00:57:57,639 --> 00:58:00,904
...and you start stabbing Harken to death
in front of the neighborhood?

1086
00:58:01,076 --> 00:58:03,306
- Harken?
- Who'd you think you were stabbing?

1087
00:58:03,478 --> 00:58:04,638
I wasn't stabbing anyone.

1088
00:58:04,813 --> 00:58:08,510
He had an allergic reaction to some peanuts
and I rescued him, know what I mean?

1089
00:58:08,684 --> 00:58:10,675
He had a little allergy shot on him
and I...

1090
00:58:10,886 --> 00:58:13,912
I mean, I jabbed him with that,
but I was just saving his life.

1091
00:58:14,089 --> 00:58:15,852
- Saved a man's life.
Hang on a second.

1092
00:58:16,024 --> 00:58:18,584
So my boss, who we're
thinking about planning to kill...

1093
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,251
...is dying in front of you
and you saved his life?

1094
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,864
Well, that sounds bad
when you say it like that.

1095
00:58:24,032 --> 00:58:26,296
- Can you open the door?
- That's not cool.

1096
00:58:26,468 --> 00:58:28,993
- But I didn't know it was Harken.
Hit the button.

1097
00:58:29,171 --> 00:58:31,435
This is why I need to know
what people look like.

1098
00:58:31,606 --> 00:58:33,267
You're mad at me for killing him...

1099
00:58:33,442 --> 00:58:35,410
Can we give him a time-out?
For one second.

1100
00:58:35,577 --> 00:58:37,807
Make up your fucking mind. It's like...

1101
00:58:37,979 --> 00:58:39,003
What is this?

1102
00:58:39,181 --> 00:58:41,513
You gotta admit
we got some good intel tonight.

1103
00:58:41,683 --> 00:58:45,084
Harken is allergic to peanuts
and Pellit's got a huge stash of cocaine.

1104
00:58:45,253 --> 00:58:46,515
Are you playing this game?

1105
00:58:46,688 --> 00:58:50,852
So all we gotta do is figure a way to get
peanuts somewhere into Harken's house...

1106
00:58:51,026 --> 00:58:52,960
...and put some poison in Pellit's coke.

1107
00:58:53,128 --> 00:58:56,256
It's easy for someone to think
Pellit got a bad batch of cocaine.

1108
00:58:56,431 --> 00:58:59,525
You seriously locking me
out of the car like we're in 8th grade?

1109
00:58:59,701 --> 00:59:02,431
What about Harken? Probably
always got that injector thing.

1110
00:59:02,604 --> 00:59:03,969
Doesn't shower with it.

1111
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:06,437
So then we'll put some peanuts
inside his shampoo.

1112
00:59:06,641 --> 00:59:09,303
A couple of fatal accidents
we're not even there for.

1113
00:59:09,478 --> 00:59:12,003
- Motherfucker Jones would be so proud.
- Yeah, he would.

1114
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:14,842
- Getting old.
- What do you do about dummy's boss?

1115
00:59:15,016 --> 00:59:17,644
I'll stake her out tomorrow
and get to the bottom of it.

1116
00:59:17,819 --> 00:59:20,686
A man has his limits.
- That left a fucking dent.

1117
00:59:23,091 --> 00:59:24,820
Get him fucking home.

1118
00:59:24,993 --> 00:59:29,054
Very funny. That was very funny, guys.

1119
00:59:29,231 --> 00:59:31,722
We have one thing to figure out,
if you can help us.

1120
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:35,267
If Nick and I were in prison,
who do you think would get raped more?

1121
00:59:36,071 --> 00:59:37,299
Nick.

1122
00:59:37,472 --> 00:59:40,441
Really? Why?

1123
00:59:40,675 --> 00:59:43,701
It's about weakness and vulnerability.
It's not a looks thing.

1124
00:59:43,879 --> 00:59:45,073
It probably would be Nick.

1125
00:59:45,247 --> 00:59:48,478
Getting locked out of the car
is bullshit, man.

1126
01:00:32,861 --> 01:00:34,761
That's an awesome deal.

1127
01:00:40,569 --> 01:00:43,629
Jesus, Dale. It's a murder,
not a cocktail party.

1128
01:00:43,805 --> 01:00:46,239
I know. You don't have to
announce that to the world.

1129
01:00:46,408 --> 01:00:49,400
There was a great deal on nuts.
I'm not gonna pass up on savings.

1130
01:00:49,578 --> 01:00:50,772
Okay, so this is it.

1131
01:00:50,946 --> 01:00:55,178
I'm doing Pellit, you're gonna do Harken,
and you'll get some intel from Julia, right?

1132
01:00:55,417 --> 01:00:57,908
- Copy that.
- Okay. See you on the other side.

1133
01:01:28,316 --> 01:01:29,749
Okay.

1134
01:01:34,322 --> 01:01:36,187
Thank you, Kimmy.
You're welcome.

1135
01:01:36,925 --> 01:01:37,949
That was great.

1136
01:01:38,126 --> 01:01:40,424
See you next time.
Yeah.

1137
01:01:40,595 --> 01:01:43,962
- Thank you, Bill.
Thank you, Bobby.

1138
01:01:51,773 --> 01:01:53,365
What?

1139
01:01:54,009 --> 01:01:55,306
Whew.

1140
01:01:56,211 --> 01:01:57,235
Oh.

1141
01:02:04,586 --> 01:02:05,917
Shit.

1142
01:02:07,656 --> 01:02:09,556
- Hey.
How's it going over there?

1143
01:02:09,925 --> 01:02:13,053
- What do you know about Julia?
I learned I gotta switch dentists...

1144
01:02:13,228 --> 01:02:15,219
...because this woman
is unbelievably hot.

1145
01:02:15,397 --> 01:02:18,594
- How's it going over there?
- Uh, it's...

1146
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:23,394
Just... I'm waiting for, you know,
Pellit to sleep or leave or...

1147
01:02:23,571 --> 01:02:26,039
Just... Just waiting.

1148
01:02:26,207 --> 01:02:28,937
Wonder what, uh,
Dale's doing with Harken.

1149
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:30,839
It's gonna be really hard.

1150
01:02:31,012 --> 01:02:34,846
And we'll have to work at this every day,
but I wanna do that because I want you.

1151
01:02:35,016 --> 01:02:38,349
I want all of you forever, you and me,
every day...

1152
01:02:56,171 --> 01:02:58,435
Everybody was kung-fu fighting

1153
01:02:59,841 --> 01:03:03,106
Everybody was kung-fu fighting

1154
01:03:05,213 --> 01:03:06,805
Give me that.

1155
01:03:06,982 --> 01:03:08,711
Give it to me.

1156
01:03:27,202 --> 01:03:31,161
Jesus. Where does this guy
get the energy?

1157
01:03:34,409 --> 01:03:36,001
Oh, yeah.

1158
01:03:54,329 --> 01:03:56,388
What the fuck was that?

1159
01:04:02,837 --> 01:04:05,670
Okay. Okay.

1160
01:04:10,745 --> 01:04:14,044
Okay. Okay.

1161
01:04:19,154 --> 01:04:22,055
- Yeah, Dale?
- I don't think I can do this.

1162
01:04:22,757 --> 01:04:25,521
Look, I know
you really hate Harken but...

1163
01:04:26,428 --> 01:04:28,259
...I don't think
I can go through with it.

1164
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:29,454
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1165
01:04:29,631 --> 01:04:32,691
I know. I've been thinking
the same thing.

1166
01:04:32,867 --> 01:04:35,427
- Yeah, let's just call it off.
- What the fuck?

1167
01:04:35,603 --> 01:04:37,730
- What?
- It's Harken. He's here.

1168
01:04:37,906 --> 01:04:38,964
He's at Pellit's? Why?

1169
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:41,631
I don't know. He's walking
right up to the front door.

1170
01:04:42,077 --> 01:04:44,841
- You think he's onto us?
- How the fuck do I know?

1171
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,214
Knock a little louder?

1172
01:04:47,382 --> 01:04:48,406
What? What?

1173
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:54,111
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ,
Harken just shot Pellit.

1174
01:04:54,289 --> 01:04:55,654
Are you sure?

1175
01:04:55,824 --> 01:04:59,191
Holy shit. Pellit opened up the door,
Harken shot him in the chest...

1176
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,521
...he fell down, he shot him again
in the head.

1177
01:05:01,696 --> 01:05:05,257
He shot him? Wait, what's going on?
I don't understand. He shot him?

1178
01:05:05,433 --> 01:05:07,458
Nick? Say something.
Nick, Nick.

1179
01:05:07,635 --> 01:05:10,832
Nick! Nick, Nick, talk to me.
Nick, what's happening?

1180
01:05:11,005 --> 01:05:12,097
What's going on?

1181
01:05:12,273 --> 01:05:14,741
- How's Pellit doing?
- Still pretty fucking dead, Dale.

1182
01:05:22,016 --> 01:05:25,952
I gotta get out of here before somebody
sees me. Meet me at the bar. I'll call Kurt.

1183
01:05:26,121 --> 01:05:27,520
Yeah. I'll meet you there.

1184
01:05:27,689 --> 01:05:31,591
I might throw up a couple times in the toilet
here, but then I'll meet you there.

1185
01:05:33,995 --> 01:05:35,053
Oh.

1186
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:36,527
Oh, Toyota.

1187
01:05:47,575 --> 01:05:49,270
Stay calm. We'll figure this out.

1188
01:05:49,444 --> 01:05:51,435
"Calm"?
I saw a guy get shot an hour ago.

1189
01:05:51,613 --> 01:05:55,105
- I know. A guy you were gonna kill anyway.
- Listen, I don't know about that.

1190
01:05:55,316 --> 01:05:56,977
- What?
- Don't know if I had it in me.

1191
01:05:57,152 --> 01:05:59,211
I freaked out and panicked,
got out of there.

1192
01:05:59,387 --> 01:06:01,821
Are you kidding?
You can't change a plan like this...

1193
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:03,014
I'm not a murderer.

1194
01:06:03,191 --> 01:06:06,183
You think when it came down to it,
you'd be able to kill Julia?

1195
01:06:06,361 --> 01:06:10,195
I don't know. Maybe you're right.
It is a little hard to imagine killing her now.

1196
01:06:10,365 --> 01:06:13,459
- "Now"?
Wait, what does that mean?

1197
01:06:13,635 --> 01:06:15,227
- Did you sleep with her?
- No, no.

1198
01:06:15,403 --> 01:06:17,803
Tell me you didn't sleep with her.
- You're a mess.

1199
01:06:17,972 --> 01:06:20,236
But this time it wasn't my fault,
I swear to God.

1200
01:06:20,408 --> 01:06:22,774
You will be a suspect
if you try and kill her now.

1201
01:06:22,944 --> 01:06:25,970
At first I was surveilling her,
like I was asked to do.

1202
01:06:26,147 --> 01:06:30,311
- She's incredibly hot, by the way. So hot.
- Don't talk about how hot she is, bastard.

1203
01:06:30,485 --> 01:06:32,680
Next thing,
she starts deliberately undressing.

1204
01:06:32,854 --> 01:06:33,878
Come on.

1205
01:06:34,055 --> 01:06:35,989
In front of her window with the lights on.

1206
01:06:36,157 --> 01:06:38,557
- Like she knew I was watching.
"Deliberately undressed"?

1207
01:06:38,726 --> 01:06:40,887
Slowly, seductively,
lot of shoulder moves...

1208
01:06:41,062 --> 01:06:42,927
...is clearly putting on a show.

1209
01:06:43,097 --> 01:06:45,998
- Next she makes herself a little snack.
She have a nice chest?

1210
01:06:46,167 --> 01:06:47,191
A Popsicle.

1211
01:06:47,368 --> 01:06:48,926
- Then a banana.
Come on.

1212
01:06:49,103 --> 01:06:52,630
- And finally, a hot dog. I mean, come on.
Now I don't believe your story.

1213
01:06:52,807 --> 01:06:55,674
Three penis-shaped foods,
that can't be a coincidence, right?

1214
01:06:55,843 --> 01:06:58,437
Eating them in that weird order?
Not a proper meal.

1215
01:06:58,613 --> 01:06:59,671
It's cold to hot.

1216
01:06:59,847 --> 01:07:02,748
Fine. So you took the penis foods
as an invitation to fuck her.

1217
01:07:02,917 --> 01:07:06,717
No, no. God, no. I took her invitation
to fuck her as an invitation to fuck her.

1218
01:07:06,921 --> 01:07:09,185
She lured me in. It was
like one of these things.

1219
01:07:09,357 --> 01:07:11,848
Something clinically wrong with you.
You're a whore.

1220
01:07:12,026 --> 01:07:14,859
Come on. That's not nice, okay?
Look, your problem's solved.

1221
01:07:15,029 --> 01:07:16,519
She won't mess with you anymore.

1222
01:07:16,698 --> 01:07:19,326
Can we move on?
Let's talk about what happened to Pellit.

1223
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:23,163
All right, okay. Let me think. Okay,
here's what I'm thinking. Here's my idea.

1224
01:07:23,338 --> 01:07:25,738
We call the cops
with an anonymous tip. All right?

1225
01:07:25,907 --> 01:07:27,932
We tell them Harken killed Pellit. Boom.

1226
01:07:28,109 --> 01:07:31,545
Harken's in jail, Pellit's in hell,
Julia's had the crazy fucked out of her...

1227
01:07:31,713 --> 01:07:33,908
...and all three of us
have our problems solved.

1228
01:07:34,082 --> 01:07:36,312
It could work. An anonymous tip,
that's not bad.

1229
01:07:36,484 --> 01:07:37,508
Mm-hm.

1230
01:07:37,685 --> 01:07:40,620
Gotta be from a pay phone, though,
so it's not traced back to us.

1231
01:07:40,788 --> 01:07:43,814
- Exactly.
- Good. Let's take my car. Let's do it.

1232
01:07:44,859 --> 01:07:47,521
All right. Where do you even
find a pay phone these days?

1233
01:07:47,695 --> 01:07:49,663
There's a ton at the bus station for sure.

1234
01:07:49,831 --> 01:07:52,629
Oh, yeah, I guess that's a good point.
Maybe the mall.

1235
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,233
What is this?

1236
01:07:54,636 --> 01:07:57,400
- What is this?
- Is that for us?

1237
01:07:57,572 --> 01:07:59,699
What?
- Oh, shit.

1238
01:08:07,482 --> 01:08:09,245
All the way down.

1239
01:08:10,685 --> 01:08:12,277
Right there.

1240
01:08:13,988 --> 01:08:17,685
- Are you the owner of this vehicle?
- I own it. Yup.

1241
01:08:17,892 --> 01:08:23,262
We got an APB on a gray Toyota Prius,
license 2-Whiskey-Alpha-Quincy-2-3-3.

1242
01:08:23,431 --> 01:08:24,659
- How come?
- Hang on, man.

1243
01:08:24,832 --> 01:08:26,800
- Did I talk to you?
- No.

1244
01:08:27,235 --> 01:08:29,931
That's this car. Tell me how I can help.

1245
01:08:30,104 --> 01:08:33,164
A traffic cam caught this car
fleeing the scene of a crime tonight.

1246
01:08:33,341 --> 01:08:36,799
- Would you know anything about that?
- I don't know why it would do that.

1247
01:08:37,245 --> 01:08:40,214
I mean, I don't know. What happened?

1248
01:08:40,381 --> 01:08:42,406
- Have you been drinking?
- No.

1249
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:43,978
I smell alcohol.

1250
01:08:44,152 --> 01:08:46,347
- This guy and the mouth in the back.
- That's me.

1251
01:08:47,622 --> 01:08:49,783
I'm gonna need you
to follow us to the station.

1252
01:08:49,957 --> 01:08:51,151
Officer.

1253
01:08:51,526 --> 01:08:52,652
My man.

1254
01:08:54,729 --> 01:08:58,790
I cannot believe I let you talk me into
this whole thing. I cannot believe it.

1255
01:08:58,966 --> 01:09:01,093
Are you kidding me?
We were being hypothetical.

1256
01:09:01,269 --> 01:09:03,601
- Being hypothetical?
- You're the one that pushed us into it.

1257
01:09:07,942 --> 01:09:11,969
Do you wanna explain
why you were doing 61 in a 25 zone...

1258
01:09:12,146 --> 01:09:14,341
...one block from the victim's house...

1259
01:09:14,515 --> 01:09:16,676
...just moments after he got shot dead?

1260
01:09:18,286 --> 01:09:19,514
I was drag racing.

1261
01:09:20,688 --> 01:09:23,623
- I'm a drag racer.
- You were drag racing?

1262
01:09:23,791 --> 01:09:24,849
Mm.

1263
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,084
In a Prius?

1264
01:09:30,498 --> 01:09:31,590
I don't win a lot.

1265
01:09:31,766 --> 01:09:34,098
Here's what I don't understand.

1266
01:09:34,268 --> 01:09:36,463
You were at the crime scene.

1267
01:09:36,637 --> 01:09:40,937
Hour later we find the car. You happened to
be hanging with this freaky motherfucker.

1268
01:09:41,109 --> 01:09:43,907
- A registered sex offender.
- It was an empty playground.

1269
01:09:44,078 --> 01:09:48,208
And this guy. Who happens to be working
for Pellit Chemicals, the victim's company.

1270
01:09:48,683 --> 01:09:50,082
What?

1271
01:09:51,452 --> 01:09:52,680
My boss was murdered?

1272
01:09:53,554 --> 01:09:58,924
Oh, wow. What were you doing at his
house, Nick? Why were you there?

1273
01:09:59,961 --> 01:10:02,452
Where were you during the murder?

1274
01:10:03,097 --> 01:10:06,999
I was making love.
I was making love to a woman.

1275
01:10:07,168 --> 01:10:09,295
Yeah. Murdering some ass.

1276
01:10:10,638 --> 01:10:13,198
- Detectives...
No, uh, I have a question.

1277
01:10:13,374 --> 01:10:16,036
If one of us knew, you know,
who the shooter was...

1278
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:20,544
...and he was willing to
serve you that perp on a platter...

1279
01:10:21,215 --> 01:10:24,673
...he would be entitled
to some sort of immunity, right?

1280
01:10:24,852 --> 01:10:27,685
No. He would be entitled
to some jail time.

1281
01:10:28,189 --> 01:10:30,680
If he knew who the shooter was
and didn't tell us...

1282
01:10:30,858 --> 01:10:32,723
...that would be obstruction of justice.

1283
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,791
Glad none of us
know who the shooter is.

1284
01:10:34,962 --> 01:10:40,059
Listen, if you think we're gonna believe
that this is all just a big coincidence...

1285
01:10:40,234 --> 01:10:42,395
...we're gonna be here for a long time.

1286
01:10:44,238 --> 01:10:49,266
Okay, wait. By saying
"we're gonna be here for a long time"...

1287
01:10:49,911 --> 01:10:52,709
...you're implying that
we're not allowed to leave...

1288
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:56,475
...which would only be the case if we
were under arrest. Are we under arrest?

1289
01:10:56,784 --> 01:10:59,651
No. We just brought you in
for questioning.

1290
01:11:00,621 --> 01:11:03,351
Well, then, ipso facto...

1291
01:11:03,524 --> 01:11:06,857
...you don't have sufficient evidence...

1292
01:11:07,028 --> 01:11:09,826
...constituting probable cause
for an arrest warrant.

1293
01:11:09,997 --> 01:11:11,021
Not yet.

1294
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:15,693
Well, uh, then, pursuant to
the Fourth Amendment...

1295
01:11:16,671 --> 01:11:20,129
...I believe we are free to go.
Are we not?

1296
01:11:20,775 --> 01:11:22,208
Yeah, technically. Yeah.

1297
01:11:23,244 --> 01:11:25,212
Technically is good enough for me.

1298
01:11:25,379 --> 01:11:28,212
Gentlemen, ahem, we are free men.

1299
01:11:28,683 --> 01:11:30,173
Let's go.

1300
01:11:30,351 --> 01:11:32,444
We gotta get back to your car.
Keep moving.

1301
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:35,088
We get a cab? Take the train?
What do you wanna do?

1302
01:11:35,256 --> 01:11:38,919
- You ever been on a subway in this town?
- Pretty great. Where'd that come from?

1303
01:11:39,093 --> 01:11:41,857
Law & Order, okay? You can
learn stuff watching Law & Order.

1304
01:11:42,029 --> 01:11:43,860
- We showed them, huh?
- We did show them.

1305
01:11:44,031 --> 01:11:45,555
You were about to turn us in.

1306
01:11:45,733 --> 01:11:49,863
There was a few conversations about ratting
each other out, but it was gonna be fine.

1307
01:11:50,037 --> 01:11:51,299
Hold on.

1308
01:11:51,472 --> 01:11:54,270
That's for you, hotshot.
Speeding and running a red light.

1309
01:11:55,142 --> 01:11:57,269
You boys don't get
too comfortable out there.

1310
01:11:57,445 --> 01:12:02,542
Our forensics team is sweeping the Pellit
house right now for DNA and fingerprints.

1311
01:12:02,917 --> 01:12:05,750
And I'll tell you something.
They don't miss shit.

1312
01:12:10,424 --> 01:12:12,483
In the butt you go, go, go.

1313
01:12:14,228 --> 01:12:16,594
Why would you put his whole bathroom
in your ass?!

1314
01:12:16,764 --> 01:12:20,757
- I didn't I know I had DNA in my butt.
- Lying! You know there's DNA in your butt.

1315
01:12:20,935 --> 01:12:23,403
You just like shoving shit in your ass,
you fucking pervert!

1316
01:12:23,571 --> 01:12:25,368
We are lawyering up, man. That's it.

1317
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:29,499
I don't have money for a lawyer. I bought
a very expensive ring I can't afford...

1318
01:12:29,677 --> 01:12:32,612
...then I gave the rest of my motherfucking
money to Motherfucker Jones.

1319
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:34,372
That's who we should talk to.

1320
01:12:34,549 --> 01:12:38,542
- He's covered us this far, right? Five grand?
- Five thousand. Forty, with the briefcase.

1321
01:12:38,753 --> 01:12:41,017
- Shut up about that!
- Shut up about the briefcase.

1322
01:12:43,824 --> 01:12:46,224
Excuse me. Excuse me. Da-da-da.

1323
01:12:46,394 --> 01:12:49,886
- Hello, Motherfucker.
- Hey, look who's back. Look who's back.

1324
01:12:50,064 --> 01:12:52,897
Whatever happened to
that, uh, Strangers on a Train shit?

1325
01:12:53,067 --> 01:12:54,728
Didn't work out. We need your help.

1326
01:12:54,902 --> 01:12:57,735
One of our intended victims
killed the other intended victim.

1327
01:12:57,905 --> 01:12:59,497
- Shut the fuck up.
- It's gone bad.

1328
01:12:59,674 --> 01:13:01,539
You guys are some fucking evil geniuses.

1329
01:13:01,709 --> 01:13:05,167
Thank you, but we had nothing to do
with it. We don't know why it happened.

1330
01:13:05,346 --> 01:13:06,870
The cops bring us in as suspects.

1331
01:13:07,048 --> 01:13:10,745
Kurt's DNA's all over the apartment because
he shoved a toothbrush up his ass.

1332
01:13:10,918 --> 01:13:13,443
That's not the point.
- I'm giving him the whole story.

1333
01:13:13,621 --> 01:13:15,748
I got you. First thing first,
we gotta handle business.

1334
01:13:15,923 --> 01:13:17,481
Mm-hm.

1335
01:13:17,992 --> 01:13:20,722
- I need $5000.
- There's gonna be no more money.

1336
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,487
- Two thousand?
- Absolutely not.

1337
01:13:22,663 --> 01:13:25,757
No way, Motherfucker. No.

1338
01:13:26,667 --> 01:13:28,601
All right, look, pay for my drinks.

1339
01:13:28,769 --> 01:13:30,293
- Pay for his drink.
- I'll do that.

1340
01:13:30,471 --> 01:13:31,961
Not a very good negotiator.

1341
01:13:32,139 --> 01:13:35,233
The guy that killed the other guy,
are the cops after him?

1342
01:13:35,409 --> 01:13:37,240
No, no, they don't suspect him.

1343
01:13:37,411 --> 01:13:39,345
Then this is what you need to do:

1344
01:13:39,614 --> 01:13:44,017
Get him to confess to the murder
while you're wearing a wire.

1345
01:13:44,185 --> 01:13:45,846
A wire? We can do that. That's easy.

1346
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:49,183
That how they got you
when you murdered somebody?

1347
01:13:53,394 --> 01:13:55,453
- I ain't never murder nobody.
- I'm sorry?

1348
01:13:55,730 --> 01:13:57,561
I never murdered anybody.

1349
01:13:57,732 --> 01:14:00,701
Wait, no. You said you did a dime
for some pretty nasty shit.

1350
01:14:00,868 --> 01:14:04,099
It was some nasty shit,
but does that mean I murdered somebody?

1351
01:14:04,271 --> 01:14:07,001
- You implied it.
- You didn't murder someone, what'd you do?

1352
01:14:08,342 --> 01:14:10,435
All right, listen, get in here.

1353
01:14:13,247 --> 01:14:15,841
You guys ever see the movie
Snow Falling on Cedars?

1354
01:14:16,017 --> 01:14:17,041
No.

1355
01:14:17,218 --> 01:14:18,879
- Never seen that.
- I love that movie.

1356
01:14:19,053 --> 01:14:22,819
What happened was is that I took a video
camera into the movie and I bootleg it.

1357
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:25,458
They was waiting right outside the exit.
They got me.

1358
01:14:25,626 --> 01:14:27,651
- You did 10 years for video piracy?
- Yeah.

1359
01:14:27,828 --> 01:14:30,524
- They take that shit so serious, man.
- Not that seriously.

1360
01:14:30,698 --> 01:14:32,290
We've been taking murder advice...

1361
01:14:32,466 --> 01:14:35,629
...from some guy whose biggest crime
is taping an Ethan Hawke movie.

1362
01:14:35,803 --> 01:14:38,237
- So you do know the movie.
- I know who's in it.

1363
01:14:38,406 --> 01:14:42,308
Everyone knows the movie. That's not
the point. You tricked us, Motherfuck...

1364
01:14:42,476 --> 01:14:47,072
Hang on a second, something doesn't
stack up quite right with this, all right?

1365
01:14:47,248 --> 01:14:51,514
So you just call yourself a video pirate,
right? Pirating the high seas of videocy?

1366
01:14:51,686 --> 01:14:54,177
Why do you carry a gun on you,
Mr. Video Pirate?

1367
01:14:54,355 --> 01:14:55,845
- A gun?
- Yeah.

1368
01:14:56,023 --> 01:14:58,150
- I don't wanna see it.
- It's my cell phone.

1369
01:14:59,226 --> 01:15:02,320
- It's a Sidekick. I'm gonna be in the car.
Oh, shit.

1370
01:15:02,496 --> 01:15:06,592
You grab at it like a gun and you confuse
people. Goddamn it, I feel like a moron.

1371
01:15:06,767 --> 01:15:08,428
- Let's go.
- You are a moron.

1372
01:15:08,836 --> 01:15:13,432
Look, you don't go into a bar and
hand a guy $5000 just because he black.

1373
01:15:13,607 --> 01:15:15,802
It was never a black-white thing.
- No, come on.

1374
01:15:15,976 --> 01:15:17,944
Let's go. Come on. Dale.

1375
01:15:18,112 --> 01:15:20,103
Y'all motherfuckers crazy.

1376
01:15:30,491 --> 01:15:32,220
Okay.

1377
01:15:32,393 --> 01:15:33,553
Looks pretty quiet, yeah?

1378
01:15:33,728 --> 01:15:38,028
Yeah, it does. Okay, tape recorder's ready
to roll, I got some fresh batteries in here.

1379
01:15:38,199 --> 01:15:42,135
It was a pretty big investment so I should
be the one who does the tape-recording.

1380
01:15:42,303 --> 01:15:44,498
- No way. No, I'll do it.
- You're gonna do it?

1381
01:15:44,672 --> 01:15:46,697
You'll have to duct-tape that
to your chest.

1382
01:15:46,874 --> 01:15:49,274
I can't tape this to my chest.
I have hair on chest.

1383
01:15:49,443 --> 01:15:52,310
Just put it in your pocket.
Not gonna tape it to his chest.

1384
01:15:52,947 --> 01:15:57,145
So, what do we do? Wait for him to come
home, we grab a office chair or something?

1385
01:15:57,318 --> 01:16:00,810
One of us gets in the chair, spins around
and dramatically confronts him.

1386
01:16:00,988 --> 01:16:02,819
- I'm in the chair.
- Nick's in the chair.

1387
01:16:02,990 --> 01:16:04,855
- Why are you in the chair?
- He's my boss.

1388
01:16:05,025 --> 01:16:08,483
Maybe we should get three chairs
and all spin around at the same time.

1389
01:16:08,662 --> 01:16:09,754
Confront him like that.

1390
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:12,398
That's not intimidating,
that's like a musical number.

1391
01:16:14,135 --> 01:16:15,261
Watch out for the cat.

1392
01:16:15,436 --> 01:16:16,630
Surprise!

1393
01:16:18,973 --> 01:16:21,567
Okay. It's a false alarm.
Just mingle, mingle, mingle.

1394
01:16:21,742 --> 01:16:22,970
Hi. Who are you?

1395
01:16:23,144 --> 01:16:24,975
Come inside. Close that door. Hurry.

1396
01:16:25,146 --> 01:16:27,011
Um, okay. Now, wait a minute.

1397
01:16:27,181 --> 01:16:30,480
You're the young man who helped Dave
out on the street the other night.

1398
01:16:30,651 --> 01:16:32,949
- That's him.
- Yeah, that's who I am.

1399
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:37,079
- How is he?
- He is great, thanks to you. Thank you.

1400
01:16:37,658 --> 01:16:39,853
- Did I invite you?
- You did and you didn't.

1401
01:16:40,027 --> 01:16:41,858
I work with your husband. We're late.

1402
01:16:42,029 --> 01:16:44,122
- These are my plus-twos.
He's in the garage.

1403
01:16:44,298 --> 01:16:46,323
Oh, we should hide.
Everybody, come on in.

1404
01:16:47,368 --> 01:16:51,304
Someone get the lights.
- Get down, get down, get down.

1405
01:16:52,173 --> 01:16:55,973
I'm Kurt, by the way. I didn't
get a chance to introduce myself at the door.

1406
01:16:56,143 --> 01:16:59,271
- Oh, hey, Rhonda. Hi. Hi.
- Hi, Rhonda. Very nice to meet you.

1407
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:02,005
Nick didn't tell me
his boss was married to a model.

1408
01:17:02,183 --> 01:17:04,310
Ha, ha. Yeah, not a model.

1409
01:17:05,686 --> 01:17:07,381
When did you quit?

1410
01:17:11,926 --> 01:17:13,917
Surprise!

1411
01:17:14,094 --> 01:17:16,392
Goddamn it! God, I hate that!

1412
01:17:16,564 --> 01:17:17,758
We got you, huh, honey?

1413
01:17:18,632 --> 01:17:20,930
- So you were surprised?
- Yeah.

1414
01:17:21,101 --> 01:17:22,363
Look, sweetie, everybody's here.

1415
01:17:23,838 --> 01:17:25,305
I'm gonna put my stuff down.

1416
01:17:25,472 --> 01:17:28,202
She knows I hate surprises.

1417
01:17:28,542 --> 01:17:32,103
I think we got him. Ha, ha.
We got him good.

1418
01:17:33,314 --> 01:17:34,906
Okay.

1419
01:17:35,082 --> 01:17:37,482
He's gone off on his own.
This is our chance.

1420
01:17:37,651 --> 01:17:39,380
- You guys ready?
- Yeah, very ready.

1421
01:17:39,553 --> 01:17:41,350
Stay close, okay?
Mm-hm.

1422
01:17:41,722 --> 01:17:44,156
Let's do it. Let's do it.

1423
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:47,327
Harken.

1424
01:17:48,529 --> 01:17:50,292
I cannot believe my wife invited you.

1425
01:17:50,564 --> 01:17:53,362
What are you doing here?
Come to stab me a few more times?

1426
01:17:53,534 --> 01:17:56,059
- We know what you did.
- Well, what does that mean?

1427
01:17:56,237 --> 01:17:58,330
We were there. We saw you kill him.

1428
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,639
Really?

1429
01:18:01,475 --> 01:18:03,943
So, what is this, then?
Your little shakedown?

1430
01:18:05,045 --> 01:18:07,843
You think that you can blackmail me...

1431
01:18:08,449 --> 01:18:11,714
...because you saw me
kill my wife's lover?

1432
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,080
Say his name!

1433
01:18:16,023 --> 01:18:17,490
What?

1434
01:18:18,192 --> 01:18:20,387
The man you killed, you say his name.

1435
01:18:20,561 --> 01:18:23,792
Pellit? Trust me, Pellit's name
means nothing anymore.

1436
01:18:23,964 --> 01:18:26,398
There it is. Thank you. Let's do it, guys.

1437
01:18:26,567 --> 01:18:29,035
Yeah, that's right.
- Hang on. Where the fuck is Kurt?

1438
01:18:29,203 --> 01:18:30,795
I killed Pellit.

1439
01:18:30,971 --> 01:18:32,802
Hold that thought,
I'm missing my friend Kurt.

1440
01:18:32,973 --> 01:18:37,535
I walked right up to his door, I put
a gun in his chest and I shot him.

1441
01:18:37,711 --> 01:18:40,942
Then you know what? You know
what I did after that? I shot him again.

1442
01:18:41,115 --> 01:18:43,083
And let me tell you something.

1443
01:18:43,717 --> 01:18:45,582
I liked it.

1444
01:18:46,453 --> 01:18:50,321
So if you think
that I'm some sort of pussy...

1445
01:18:50,491 --> 01:18:55,053
...who won't do exactly the same thing
to a couple of lame-assed blackmailers...

1446
01:18:55,229 --> 01:18:56,355
...think again.

1447
01:18:56,530 --> 01:18:59,624
Know who thinks you're a pussy?
My friend Kurt. Let me grab him.

1448
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,233
You are pathetic, Hendricks.

1449
01:19:02,536 --> 01:19:08,600
You walk into my house on
my goddamn birthday and pull this shit.

1450
01:19:10,244 --> 01:19:11,802
Well, let me tell you something.

1451
01:19:13,247 --> 01:19:15,078
You're dead.

1452
01:19:15,716 --> 01:19:18,207
You and you.

1453
01:19:18,385 --> 01:19:19,716
- And...?
- Kurt.

1454
01:19:19,887 --> 01:19:22,515
Kurt. Dead men.

1455
01:19:23,257 --> 01:19:25,851
I didn't know it was your birthday.
What's he doing?

1456
01:19:26,026 --> 01:19:28,654
- What do you got?
- Getting my gun. Only take a second.

1457
01:19:28,829 --> 01:19:30,126
- I'll get the car.
- I'll go.

1458
01:19:30,297 --> 01:19:34,324
We had him, we had the whole goddamn
thing. What the fuck happened to Kurt?

1459
01:19:34,601 --> 01:19:35,761
Hey!
- There you are.

1460
01:19:35,936 --> 01:19:36,960
Where were you?

1461
01:19:37,137 --> 01:19:39,537
My, uh, stomach was bothering me.
Had to use the bathroom.

1462
01:19:39,707 --> 01:19:41,971
He confessed everything,
now he's getting his gun.

1463
01:19:42,142 --> 01:19:43,609
Kurt, what happened there?
- Oh, uh...

1464
01:19:43,777 --> 01:19:45,768
...she was giving me a tour
of the mouth... House.

1465
01:19:46,213 --> 01:19:49,046
- Ow! What are you...?
- Get in the car. Right now.

1466
01:19:49,216 --> 01:19:51,309
Knock it off.
Come on.

1467
01:19:55,089 --> 01:19:57,717
Look, I wasn't thinking, okay? I'm sorry.

1468
01:19:58,258 --> 01:20:01,489
She's just very hot. And I'm weak.
I'm a weak, weak man, okay?

1469
01:20:01,662 --> 01:20:02,788
I admit it.

1470
01:20:04,164 --> 01:20:06,132
- Back it up, back it up.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1471
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:07,790
- They found my DNA.
- Back it up.

1472
01:20:07,968 --> 01:20:12,371
Go backwards. Go backwards.
See? They found your poop brush.

1473
01:20:12,973 --> 01:20:16,374
- You are obsessed with your asshole!
- No, I'm not. It was a prank, Dale.

1474
01:20:16,543 --> 01:20:19,444
Shut it down. Let's start talking about
where we're gonna live.

1475
01:20:19,613 --> 01:20:22,548
- The current situation won't work.
- There'll be cops everywhere.

1476
01:20:22,716 --> 01:20:24,013
You talking about fleeing?

1477
01:20:24,184 --> 01:20:26,744
Damn right.
I'm talking about Canada or Mexico.

1478
01:20:27,087 --> 01:20:29,783
I can't live in Mexico.
I mean, I can't handle the food.

1479
01:20:29,957 --> 01:20:31,857
My digestion alone... I'll probably die.

1480
01:20:32,026 --> 01:20:34,586
- You'd rather be in jail the rest of your life?
- Shut the fuck up.

1481
01:20:35,963 --> 01:20:38,124
I'm getting a call. I gotta get this.
Hello?

1482
01:20:38,599 --> 01:20:39,759
Hello, lover.

1483
01:20:39,933 --> 01:20:42,663
Uh, look, Julia,
now's not a good time to talk.

1484
01:20:42,836 --> 01:20:44,895
- Hey, I'm not here.
That's okay.

1485
01:20:45,072 --> 01:20:47,302
I actually meant to
call your home phone.

1486
01:20:47,474 --> 01:20:49,271
You know, tell Stacy about us.

1487
01:20:49,443 --> 01:20:52,606
- No, don't do that. Wait. Wait.
We'll learn the metric system.

1488
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:55,908
We gotta buy coats and sweaters
and learn hockey and all that shit.

1489
01:20:56,083 --> 01:20:58,347
No, I think I've waited long enough, Dale.

1490
01:20:58,519 --> 01:21:00,851
I'm sort of tired of you
toying with my emotions.

1491
01:21:01,021 --> 01:21:02,420
I'm not playing with you.

1492
01:21:02,589 --> 01:21:06,218
I'm not toying with you. I'm gonna
take care of it. I'm gonna take care of it.

1493
01:21:06,393 --> 01:21:09,260
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you gonna do to me?

1494
01:21:09,596 --> 01:21:11,257
- I'm gonna have sex with you.
- What?

1495
01:21:11,432 --> 01:21:13,559
I want you to give me details, you pussy.

1496
01:21:13,734 --> 01:21:15,395
And please be explicit.

1497
01:21:15,569 --> 01:21:18,834
Details? I'm in a car with people.
Now is not a good time for details.

1498
01:21:19,073 --> 01:21:22,406
- I don't care if it's not a great time.
Okay, fine.

1499
01:21:22,576 --> 01:21:24,601
I'm gonna make you feel good.
You know?

1500
01:21:24,778 --> 01:21:27,246
With my fingers and my tongue
and whatnot.

1501
01:21:27,414 --> 01:21:29,314
I know you can do better than that.

1502
01:21:29,483 --> 01:21:32,111
All right, I'm gonna put my penis
in your pussy, Julia.

1503
01:21:32,286 --> 01:21:34,584
Oh, boy, that's gonna get me done.

1504
01:21:36,490 --> 01:21:37,889
What the fuck was that?

1505
01:21:40,394 --> 01:21:42,919
- What the fuck?
- That's Harken. Lose him.

1506
01:21:44,164 --> 01:21:46,155
- Oh, my God!
- Get out of here.

1507
01:21:48,402 --> 01:21:50,097
Look, careful.

1508
01:21:52,606 --> 01:21:55,939
Hey, are you gonna slap me in the face
with your cock, Dale?

1509
01:21:56,110 --> 01:21:58,408
Yes, I'll slap you in the face
with my cock!

1510
01:21:58,579 --> 01:22:01,844
- This guy's fucking crazy.
- Slap you all over your face with my cock!

1511
01:22:02,316 --> 01:22:04,341
- Don't get in a wreck.
- It's go time.

1512
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,147
Okay. More, Dale.

1513
01:22:08,322 --> 01:22:09,846
I will go up and down on you...

1514
01:22:10,023 --> 01:22:12,924
...and I'll rub my naked butt
against your naked butt...

1515
01:22:13,093 --> 01:22:14,685
...until it's raw and red...

1516
01:22:14,862 --> 01:22:16,887
...and we're both really chafed up
real bad.

1517
01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:26,337
Not good. Get us out of here!
Get us out of here!

1518
01:22:26,507 --> 01:22:27,531
I got it, I got it.

1519
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:31,603
- Come on.
- I'll spit on your arms and stuff.

1520
01:22:31,778 --> 01:22:33,507
- What else?
And then I'm gonna...

1521
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:35,580
...jam my skull
into the crack of your ass!

1522
01:22:37,851 --> 01:22:39,876
Yeah, baby. In the crack of your ass.

1523
01:22:40,053 --> 01:22:43,386
And I'll dance on your boobies,
and I'll jump up and down on your butt.

1524
01:22:45,959 --> 01:22:49,122
Ah. I'll see you Friday, dirty bird.

1525
01:22:49,296 --> 01:22:50,627
Good. Friday. See you Friday.

1526
01:22:50,797 --> 01:22:52,788
Nice job fucking the crazy
out of her, Kurt!

1527
01:22:52,966 --> 01:22:55,298
Maybe I should have been
dancing on her boobs, huh?

1528
01:22:55,469 --> 01:22:56,527
Maybe you should have.

1529
01:22:56,703 --> 01:22:58,432
That was very good driving, by the way.

1530
01:22:58,605 --> 01:22:59,663
Thank you very much.

1531
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,775
Good evening, Mr. Buckman.
- Yeah, hey, Gregory. How are you?

1532
01:23:02,943 --> 01:23:05,377
Our onboard sensors
report you've had a collision.

1533
01:23:05,546 --> 01:23:07,673
That's because
we have a crazy man that hit us.

1534
01:23:07,848 --> 01:23:10,715
I will alert the authorities
and direct them to your location.

1535
01:23:10,884 --> 01:23:12,977
Don't call the cops.
They're already after us.

1536
01:23:13,153 --> 01:23:17,146
No, Gregory, they think we murdered
someone, all right? Do not call the cops.

1537
01:23:19,059 --> 01:23:20,754
What's going on?
Why you slowing down, Kurt?

1538
01:23:20,928 --> 01:23:23,897
Whoa. Oh, no, no, no. I didn't do that.
No, the engine died.

1539
01:23:24,064 --> 01:23:26,430
I remotely disabled your engine.
- What?

1540
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,329
It is standard Nav Guide protocol...

1541
01:23:28,502 --> 01:23:30,402
...whenever a driver
has committed a crime.

1542
01:23:30,571 --> 01:23:33,165
I pay 19 bucks a month
for this fucking service.

1543
01:23:33,373 --> 01:23:36,274
Remain with your vehicle.
The police will be arriving shortly.

1544
01:23:36,443 --> 01:23:39,207
Gregory, I thought you were
our fucking friend, man!

1545
01:23:54,661 --> 01:23:57,129
Get out of the car, all of you.
Come on. Come on.

1546
01:24:00,033 --> 01:24:03,093
- Remember I saved your life that one time?
Shut up.

1547
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:07,339
Just take it easy with that...
- Shut up.

1548
01:24:07,507 --> 01:24:09,168
I got six bullets in this gun.

1549
01:24:09,343 --> 01:24:12,801
Which means I can shoot all of you
twice, just like that bastard Pellit...

1550
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:14,971
...if I really wanted to,
but I'm not gonna.

1551
01:24:15,148 --> 01:24:17,616
You're not gonna shoot us twice
or not gonna shoot us?

1552
01:24:17,784 --> 01:24:18,944
Shut up.

1553
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:23,854
I got a better idea. I'm gonna tell
the cops that you killed Pellit.

1554
01:24:24,024 --> 01:24:27,653
And when I found out,
you tried to kill me to shut me up.

1555
01:24:27,828 --> 01:24:29,318
- That's crazy.
- Is it?

1556
01:24:29,496 --> 01:24:33,330
Because I don't see one shred
of evidence that proves that I shot Pellit.

1557
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,991
And besides, I'm the guy
with the bullet in his leg.

1558
01:24:36,169 --> 01:24:37,431
What?

1559
01:24:39,606 --> 01:24:41,437
God, that hurts so much.

1560
01:24:41,608 --> 01:24:43,371
Son of a bitch.

1561
01:24:43,543 --> 01:24:44,942
- Catch!
- No, don't ca...!

1562
01:24:45,112 --> 01:24:47,012
- Goddamn it, Dale.
- You see?

1563
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:50,672
You can't win a marathon without
putting some Band-Aids on your nipples.

1564
01:24:51,385 --> 01:24:53,945
- What does that mean?
- Watch this.

1565
01:24:59,793 --> 01:25:01,055
- Everybody freeze!
Police!

1566
01:25:01,228 --> 01:25:03,423
Drop the gun! On your knees!

1567
01:25:03,597 --> 01:25:06,532
Thank God.
Officers, thank God you're here.

1568
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:08,668
These guys, they shot me.

1569
01:25:08,835 --> 01:25:10,530
- That's not true!
- That's bullshit!

1570
01:25:10,704 --> 01:25:13,468
I found out they murdered someone.
They tried to shut me up.

1571
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:16,541
Please protect me from them.
I have a wife and a cat!

1572
01:25:16,710 --> 01:25:19,076
All right, take it easy.
Call for an ambulance.

1573
01:25:19,413 --> 01:25:23,110
Hey, what is this?
- It's nothing. It's just a tape recorder.

1574
01:25:23,283 --> 01:25:24,807
Oh, shit! It's a tape recorder!

1575
01:25:24,985 --> 01:25:28,045
- A tape recorder. Did you turn that off?
No, it's been recording!

1576
01:25:28,221 --> 01:25:30,587
- So listen to us, officer.
- Hands up!

1577
01:25:30,757 --> 01:25:33,783
Listen to us for one second.
He confessed to killing Pellit.

1578
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:35,257
He said he shot him twice...

1579
01:25:35,429 --> 01:25:38,660
...and he was gonna shoot us once
or twice. He was unclear about that.

1580
01:25:38,832 --> 01:25:41,062
- You are insane.
- Just play the tape.

1581
01:25:43,804 --> 01:25:46,329
But all those people are just right outside.

1582
01:25:46,506 --> 01:25:48,235
Your balls are so smooth.

1583
01:25:48,608 --> 01:25:50,132
Wait a minute. Is that my wife?

1584
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:52,210
No, no. Of course not, no.
Let's move past that.

1585
01:25:52,379 --> 01:25:55,041
...jam my skull
into the crack of your ass!

1586
01:25:55,215 --> 01:25:57,649
I'll dance on your boobies,
and jump up and down on your butt.

1587
01:25:57,818 --> 01:25:58,842
What the fuck is this?

1588
01:25:59,019 --> 01:26:02,352
Don't judge. I have a thing with my boss.
It's none of your business.

1589
01:26:02,522 --> 01:26:04,012
If you could get to the end...?

1590
01:26:07,761 --> 01:26:08,853
There's nothing on here.

1591
01:26:09,029 --> 01:26:10,428
- Shit!
- What happened?

1592
01:26:10,597 --> 01:26:12,394
Thing must have stopped
when we crashed.

1593
01:26:12,566 --> 01:26:14,227
Before this guy
supposedly confessed?

1594
01:26:14,401 --> 01:26:16,926
I told you, these guys are liars.
They cannot be trusted.

1595
01:26:17,104 --> 01:26:18,901
They shot me in the leg, killed a guy.

1596
01:26:19,072 --> 01:26:21,563
- He shot himself.
- I don't need to hear anything else.

1597
01:26:23,777 --> 01:26:25,574
- Cuff them.
Oh, my God.

1598
01:26:25,746 --> 01:26:28,510
- You don't need to cuff us.
- My God, we're going to jail.

1599
01:26:28,682 --> 01:26:30,309
We're going to jail. Unbelievable.

1600
01:26:30,484 --> 01:26:31,883
It hurts. It hurts so much.

1601
01:26:32,052 --> 01:26:33,849
Excuse me? Officers?

1602
01:26:34,054 --> 01:26:36,181
I should mention
that it is Nav Guide policy...

1603
01:26:36,356 --> 01:26:39,189
...to record all conversations
for quality assurance.

1604
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:41,657
- Who the hell's that?
- That's our Nav Guide rep.

1605
01:26:41,828 --> 01:26:43,386
- His name is Almonan.
Hands up!

1606
01:26:43,563 --> 01:26:45,121
Atmanad.
Almondmond.

1607
01:26:45,298 --> 01:26:47,630
- Atmanad is what it was!
Atmanand.

1608
01:26:47,801 --> 01:26:50,599
Atmand... Gregory, uh, play what he said.

1609
01:26:50,771 --> 01:26:53,399
- Play it just after the crash.
Very good, sir.

1610
01:26:53,573 --> 01:26:56,269
You're not gonna listen to this.
This isn't evidence.

1611
01:26:56,443 --> 01:26:58,502
I got six bullets in this gun.

1612
01:26:58,678 --> 01:27:01,647
Which means I can shoot all of you
twice, just like that bastard Pellit...

1613
01:27:01,815 --> 01:27:04,249
...if I really wanted to,
but I'm not gonna.

1614
01:27:04,418 --> 01:27:05,885
- That's it.
- So it was you.

1615
01:27:08,422 --> 01:27:11,823
That is not proof. That's just a car.
You're not gonna listen to a car.

1616
01:27:11,992 --> 01:27:14,552
Looks like I'm getting that promotion
after all. Yeah.

1617
01:27:14,961 --> 01:27:16,952
To answer your question,
that was your wife.

1618
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:19,257
- You fucked my wife?
- I fucked your wife.

1619
01:27:19,433 --> 01:27:20,457
Nobody fucks my wife!

1620
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:24,867
Ah.

1621
01:27:26,039 --> 01:27:27,472
How you like them nipples?

1622
01:27:27,641 --> 01:27:29,268
Did you just do the catchphrase?

1623
01:27:29,443 --> 01:27:31,638
- Good Will Hunting.
Good Will Hunting.

1624
01:27:31,812 --> 01:27:33,439
- That's so great.
- Caught it, yeah.

1625
01:27:33,613 --> 01:27:36,741
Good Will Hunting rip. Instead of
saying "apples" he said "nipples. "

1626
01:27:36,917 --> 01:27:38,976
- Felt like a moment.
- And happy birthday.

1627
01:27:39,152 --> 01:27:41,552
So in the end,
we didn't wind up going to jail.

1628
01:27:41,721 --> 01:27:44,315
Actually, we did later that night
when they booked us.

1629
01:27:44,491 --> 01:27:46,516
But since we led the cops to Harken...

1630
01:27:46,693 --> 01:27:49,560
...they ultimately agreed
to let our other offenses slide.

1631
01:27:49,729 --> 01:27:51,356
Strangely enough, lucky for Kurt...

1632
01:27:51,832 --> 01:27:55,529
...there's no laws on the books against
putting people's toiletries up your ass.

1633
01:27:55,702 --> 01:27:57,795
Anyway,
with Harken in his new position...

1634
01:27:57,971 --> 01:28:03,238
...on all fours in prison for 25 to life,
Comnidyne made me acting president.

1635
01:28:03,944 --> 01:28:07,607
It's a great job, I got a solid raise
and I'm actually my own boss.

1636
01:28:07,781 --> 01:28:09,078
Well, except for the CEO.

1637
01:28:09,249 --> 01:28:12,946
- Morning.
- Oh, morning. You, uh, must be Nick.

1638
01:28:13,119 --> 01:28:15,883
- I am.
- Well, it's great to finally meet you.

1639
01:28:16,056 --> 01:28:19,025
- You too, Mr. Sherman.
- Please. Lou.

1640
01:28:19,726 --> 01:28:21,626
Okay. Lou.

1641
01:28:21,795 --> 01:28:24,889
I appreciate the opportunity
you've given me. I won't let you down.

1642
01:28:25,232 --> 01:28:26,722
Yeah, I'm sure you won't, son.

1643
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:29,562
From what I hear, people say
he's the nicest guy in the world.

1644
01:28:30,937 --> 01:28:32,837
Mr. Sherman,
I'm sorry your coffee was cold.

1645
01:28:33,006 --> 01:28:34,030
Uh, Lou?

1646
01:28:34,207 --> 01:28:35,435
Most people.

1647
01:28:35,609 --> 01:28:38,578
Mr. Sherman, I'm hungry!

1648
01:28:38,745 --> 01:28:40,679
Can I come out now, please?

1649
01:28:40,847 --> 01:28:43,213
- You hear that?
- No.

1650
01:28:43,383 --> 01:28:45,476
Sounds like there's someone
in your trunk.

1651
01:28:45,685 --> 01:28:50,054
Why don't we let this
be, uh, our little secret?

1652
01:28:50,223 --> 01:28:51,622
I need a shower.

1653
01:28:51,791 --> 01:28:54,055
Yeah. Turns out my new boss...

1654
01:28:54,227 --> 01:28:56,422
...is a twisted old fuck.

1655
01:28:57,731 --> 01:29:01,599
Meanwhile, the Pellit family put the most
senior person in charge of the company...

1656
01:29:01,768 --> 01:29:04,760
...which wasn't Kurt.
But he was okay with that.

1657
01:29:04,938 --> 01:29:08,840
Because he realized that when you're
the boss, sometimes people want you dead.

1658
01:29:09,009 --> 01:29:12,376
- Hey, Kurt. Come in.
- Margie, I wanted to congratulate you.

1659
01:29:12,546 --> 01:29:13,570
Thank you.

1660
01:29:13,747 --> 01:29:17,513
If there's anything I can do to help out
before the baby gets here, let me know.

1661
01:29:17,684 --> 01:29:19,845
- What baby?
- Your baby.

1662
01:29:20,921 --> 01:29:23,913
- I'm not pregnant.
- So I'm just touching you?

1663
01:29:25,425 --> 01:29:26,551
Ay.

1664
01:29:26,927 --> 01:29:28,485
Julia.

1665
01:29:29,029 --> 01:29:33,466
I was thinking perhaps
we could drill the patient first.

1666
01:29:33,633 --> 01:29:34,657
And Dale?

1667
01:29:35,035 --> 01:29:38,596
Ultimately, he decided his only choice
was to screw Julia after all.

1668
01:29:38,772 --> 01:29:42,765
You just continue to surprise me...

1669
01:29:42,943 --> 01:29:45,104
...you dirty, dirty little man.

1670
01:29:45,545 --> 01:29:47,479
Just you wait.

1671
01:29:49,115 --> 01:29:50,707
You like that, Dale?

1672
01:29:50,884 --> 01:29:52,476
- You like that, Dale?
- Oh, my God, yeah.

1673
01:29:52,652 --> 01:29:54,483
Oh.

1674
01:29:55,689 --> 01:29:59,625
Oh, gosh, do I wish
I could have sex with Julia.

1675
01:30:02,495 --> 01:30:03,723
What?

1676
01:30:03,897 --> 01:30:06,661
I'm so sorry, but I couldn't keep it
together! It's amazing!

1677
01:30:06,833 --> 01:30:08,994
- She was talking to your penis!
- Who are you?

1678
01:30:09,169 --> 01:30:12,900
Julia, this is my good friend,
Kenny Sommerfeld.

1679
01:30:13,073 --> 01:30:14,734
Most Likely to Succeed.

1680
01:30:14,908 --> 01:30:16,967
- Give me some of that.
- Don't you touch me.

1681
01:30:17,143 --> 01:30:19,839
Now, Kenny here, he'll do
just about anything for 50 bucks.

1682
01:30:20,013 --> 01:30:22,072
- Yeah, it's true.
- Yeah, and it's not pretty.

1683
01:30:22,248 --> 01:30:24,978
But that's why I asked him
to help me frame you.

1684
01:30:25,151 --> 01:30:29,281
Really? Is this all you've got?
Your word against mine?

1685
01:30:29,456 --> 01:30:31,014
Don't forget about that guy.

1686
01:30:31,191 --> 01:30:34,752
Say hi to my cameraman.
He's filmed a lot of Hollywood hits.

1687
01:30:34,928 --> 01:30:36,657
You are a sick little bastard.

1688
01:30:36,830 --> 01:30:38,627
You are a sick little bastard.

1689
01:30:38,798 --> 01:30:40,231
Shut the fuck up for a second.

1690
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:43,369
Julia, shut the fuck up for a second,
all right?

1691
01:30:43,536 --> 01:30:45,470
Now, here's what's gonna happen, okay?

1692
01:30:45,639 --> 01:30:50,906
I'm going to take a very nice, very expensive
two-week vacation with my fiancée.

1693
01:30:51,077 --> 01:30:54,205
Let's call it a honeymoon, all right?
And you are gonna pay for it.

1694
01:30:54,414 --> 01:30:59,442
Then I'm going to return
to a rape-free workplace, all right?

1695
01:30:59,619 --> 01:31:04,556
Because if you so much as look
at my sexy little ass, Julia...

1696
01:31:04,724 --> 01:31:07,454
...I will have yours locked the fuck up...

1697
01:31:07,627 --> 01:31:13,532
...you crazy bitch whore!

1698
01:31:14,401 --> 01:31:16,995
Ah, that felt good.

1699
01:31:24,911 --> 01:31:28,745
How's the hair? Is it good, is it great?
It's not as bad as his, is it?

1700
01:31:30,383 --> 01:31:35,787
I had no idea that you called
your grandmother "Gam Gam. "

1701
01:31:38,892 --> 01:31:40,450
Calm down!

1702
01:31:41,895 --> 01:31:43,021
Oh!

1703
01:31:46,199 --> 01:31:49,396
Holy shit. He went out the door.

1704
01:31:49,736 --> 01:31:52,933
This place is awful. It's like
The Sharper Image took a shit in here.

1705
01:31:53,106 --> 01:31:54,300
Five. Forty, with the briefcase.

1706
01:31:54,474 --> 01:31:57,068
Oh, shut up about the briefcase.

1707
01:31:57,243 --> 01:32:01,043
Gonna put that "briefcabe" up my ass.

1708
01:32:02,415 --> 01:32:04,280
I'm gonna put that briefcase up my ass!

1709
01:32:11,758 --> 01:32:12,782
A dancin' girl

1710
01:32:12,959 --> 01:32:14,893
- You're good? He's good.
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1711
01:32:15,261 --> 01:32:17,786
Or else little Stacy here's
gonna get a little peek...

1712
01:32:17,964 --> 01:32:21,365
...at my photo album.

1713
01:32:24,137 --> 01:32:26,731
One more. Let's fix this.

1714
01:32:28,608 --> 01:32:31,304
Have you ever in your life
seen this much co...?

1715
01:32:34,047 --> 01:32:36,811
Pee, pee, pee, pee on the...

1716
01:32:38,284 --> 01:32:39,478
Let's...

1717
01:32:44,023 --> 01:32:46,583
Now I'm sneezing dust bunnies.
Is that diabetes?

1718
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:48,751
I'm a pharmacist, not a doctor.

1719
01:32:48,928 --> 01:32:50,657
Is that my brain?
Take my temperature.

1720
01:32:50,830 --> 01:32:52,263
Have you any, uh, roofies?

1721
01:32:52,432 --> 01:32:54,263
I want a lollipop.
Do you like karaoke?

1722
01:32:54,434 --> 01:32:57,198
Do you have MDMA?
I'll suck your d...

1723
01:33:02,509 --> 01:33:04,340
Shit happens.

1724
01:33:06,012 --> 01:33:10,881
What is your projected outside date
of completion, Motherfucker?

1725
01:33:19,692 --> 01:33:21,421
Give me that again.

1726
01:33:23,997 --> 01:33:26,295
- Oh, hi! Hi! Hello.
Hi.

1727
01:33:26,466 --> 01:33:27,694
Come on, what are you...?

1728
01:33:29,502 --> 01:33:32,733
Wouldn't mind bending her over a barrel
and showing her the 50 states.

1729
01:33:32,906 --> 01:33:34,305
I don't know what that means.

1730
01:33:34,474 --> 01:33:36,442
- It's a phrase.
- I don't think so.

1731
01:33:36,609 --> 01:33:40,443
Yeah, it is. It certainly is.
Yeah, it definitely is.

1732
01:33:40,613 --> 01:33:42,877
- Really?
- Yeah, it's from a movie.

1733
01:33:43,049 --> 01:33:44,073
Uh-uh.

1734
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:45,911
It is now.

1735
01:33:46,219 --> 01:33:47,914
Beautiful.

1736
01:33:48,305 --> 01:33:54,713
