1
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:37,455
I get to work before the sun comes up and I leave long after it's gone down.

2
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:42,001
I haven't had sex in six months with someone other than myself

3
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,920
And the only thing in my refrigerator is an old lime.

4
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:46,805
Could be a kiwi. No way to tell.

5
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:50,093
- Morning, Thomas. - Good morning, Nick. You better hurry.

6
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,786
But here's the thing:

7
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,596
This is just temporary.

8
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,020
Quick story:

9
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,935
My grandmother came to this country with $20 in her pocket.

10
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:03,197
She worked hard her whole life and never took shit from anyone.

11
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:08,657
When she died, she had turned that $20 into $2000.

12
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,662
That sucks.

13
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,664
You know why she didn't succeed?

14
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:15,497
Because she didn't take shit from anyone.

15
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:16,751
The key to success...

16
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,789
They will not teach you this in business school... is taking shit.

17
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,384
That's what I've been doing the last eight years, and it's all about to pay off

18
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:25,590
This is Nick.

19
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:29,677
I'm this close to getting a big promotion with my own office...

20
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,383
I'll be right there, Mr. Harken.

21
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,850
Then all the endless hours, and the sacrifice and the shit-eating...

22
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,309
will have been worth it.

23
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,269
See, this is what concerns me, Nick.

24
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:42,187
You're a punctual guy. You know the importance of being here right at 6 a.m.

25
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:45,193
Which is what leads me to think that...

26
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,450
there must be something wrong with the clock on our system.

27
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,952
May have been a minute late.

28
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,614
But according to this, you were two minutes late. So either you're a liar...

29
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,502
or this system is off by a full minute.

30
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,877
The only hitch?

31
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,290
I work for this guy, David Harken...

32
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:06,802
who right now is giving me some fresh shit for being two minutes late.

33
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,133
He 's a total fucking asshole.

34
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:13,551
If that's the case, I'm gonna have to fire Thomas, our longtime security coordinator.

35
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,970
- I may have been two minutes late. - Oh.

36
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:17,767
Well, then you were lying.

37
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,065
No. I... Who you calling?

38
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,858
- Thomas. I gotta let him go. - No, uh...

39
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,314
- I was lying. Sorry. - Lying?

40
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:27,402
I didn't mean to. It was more of a saying. "Might have been a minute late."

41
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:32,161
Literally, uh, truthfully, was two minutes late.

42
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:37,040
Boy, I have to get used to driving with this big, heavy ring on my finger.

43
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,577
- Come on. - I keep swerving to the left, babe.

44
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:43,088
When I was a kid, people would ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up.

45
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,839
I always gave the same answer.

46
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,090
I love you so much.

47
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,755
I love you too.

48
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,261
I wanted to be a husband.

49
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,672
- I will call you when I'm done. - Have a good day.

50
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,090
I know that sounds weird.

51
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,476
Most boys wanna be firehouse chiefs or personal trainers...

52
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,935
but to me being a husband was, like, the highest calling.

53
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,223
And thanks to Stacy...

54
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,274
that dream's about to come true.

55
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:07,939
Unfortunately, no one's gonna pay you to be a husband unless you marry Oprah.

56
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,903
So I had to find a job...

57
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,284
Now, I always admired dentists.

58
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,412
They're smart, they're capable, they keep your teeth healthy.

59
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,164
So I went out and I became one.

60
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,494
- How are you today, Dale? - I'm fine. Thanks.

61
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:22,874
Excavator.

62
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,540
- Okay, I became a dental assistant. - It's basically the same thing...

63
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,926
I just make a lot less money.

64
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,132
Did you ever see that show Gossip Girl?

65
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,171
- No. - Ooh.

66
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,306
I watched an episode last night.

67
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:39,603
I fingered myself so hard to that Penn Badgley guy, I broke a nail.

68
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,810
And it would have been the perfect job. If not for one...

69
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:47,399
evil crazy bitch, D.D.S.

70
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,698
I bet you're no shrimp in the cock department, huh, there, Dale?

71
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,153
- Okay, Julia. Come on. - What?

72
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,319
- I'm uncomfortable talking about that. - Oh, Dale, come on.

73
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,953
You know that I like to fool around.

74
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,614
Mr. Anderton.

75
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,329
Not in the office. This is bad.

76
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,335
- Bad, bad, bad! - You probably shouldn't hit the patients.

77
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,672
Ah, I love this. So festive.

78
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,003
I love my job.

79
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:13,012
If you ask me, anyone who hates their job has no one to blame but themself.

80
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,639
We make our own destinies, and I've made a sweet one.

81
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,175
We have stairs. You don't need to bring your own.

82
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,281
I'm an account manager at a chemical company.

83
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:22,221
 I'll tell you, the job has its perks.

84
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,434
Hi, can I help you?

85
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,941
He's just signing for these packages. Thank you.

86
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,271
Oh, no. I should do this.

87
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,902
Reggie, I got this. Thank you, buddy.

88
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,529
- This is high-priority stuff here. - Thank you.

89
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,315
- So, what's going on here? - I'm sorry?

90
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,951
- Is this one of those hidden camera shows? - What do you mean?

91
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,282
You're way too cute to be just a FedEx girl.

92
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,039
You gotta be a model or actress or something, right?

93
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,785
What happens when I open these? 

94
00:04:42,785 --> 00:04:44,372
Something'll jump out, bite my penis?

95
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,663
No. Nothing's gonna jump out. I'm just a FedEx girl.

96
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,251
- Shut up. - Ha, ha.

97
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,757
- Bye. - Have a great afternoon.

98
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:51,963
Thank you.

99
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,924
I didn't sign that form, by the way, so she has to come back.

100
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,133
She's cute, huh, Reg?

101
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,220
- Caught another fly in your web, did you? - Ha, ha. Hey, Jack.

102
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:02,073
But the real reason I'm here is this guy:

103
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,564
Jack Pellit, my boss. The sweetest man I know.

104
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,775
He loves me and I love him. Everybody loves him.

105
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,483
- You all right, Margie? - Hi, Mr. Pellit. Kurt.

106
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,739
I've been waiting to get in there for a while.

107
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,320
- Who's in there? - It's your son.

108
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,072
Bobby!

109
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,239
Margie's waiting. You nearly done in there?

110
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,001
A man can't get any privacy around here.

111
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,753
- Okay, Margie. Bobby? - What?

112
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:32,170
Your stomach okay? You seem to spend more time on the toilet...

113
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,424
than at your desk.

114
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,217
I didn't realize I had to tell you every time I wanna take a dump.

115
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,508
If the worst thing about this job is having to tolerate my boss's...

116
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:44,395
dipshit cokehead son, well, it's a small price to pay.

117
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,180
Need me to tell you when I pee-pee?

118
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,691
I'm just trying to get you to do your part, son. It's not easy times.

119
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,194
I do my part. I do other people's parts.

120
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,800
But it doesn't matter to you.

121
00:05:53,814 --> 00:05:56,277
You just wanna ride my ass because I'm your son.

122
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,285
You know what? I don't hear you giving dickskin any shit.

123
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,366
- "Dickskin"? Nice. - Kiss-ass.

124
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,452
- Come on, come on. - Yeah, go on. In you go.

125
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,991
- Go on, gay boy. - I'm not gay.

126
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,785
Please, I've seen gay boys. You're one of them.

127
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,296
- Where'd you see them? - At your house. Get in!

128
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,500
- I'm a green belt, motherfucker. - What?

129
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,714
- Yeah. All right? - Okay.

130
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:20,131
Now, I know you've been working your tail off for that promotion.

131
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,391
But I'm not sure I can even consider...

132
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:26,641
making you the Senior Vice President of Sales...

133
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,060
if I can't trust you.

134
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,314
- You can trust me. - Yeah, now you sound like my wife.

135
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,150
"Trust me. You can trust me, honey.

136
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,532
Nothing's happening behind your back. Trust me."

137
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,660
Meanwhile, she's fucking every guy in the neighborhood.

138
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,246
Oh, you want one?

139
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,998
It's 8:15 a.m.

140
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,661
Well, is there something wrong with a man enjoying a drink in the morning?

141
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,462
No.

142
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,673
Thank you. Sure, thanks.

143
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,434
Bottoms up.

144
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,519
Nothing for you?

145
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,981
Nick, it's 8:15 in the morning. I'm not an alcoholic.

146
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,852
The only reason I took one, I thought you were gonna have one.

147
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,020
You took one because you thought I was?

148
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,023
Is that something a Senior VP would do?

149
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,066
I was just trying to be polite.

150
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,906
So if I, uh, was gonna put my balls in honey and shaved coconut...

151
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,116
you'd do that too?

152
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,575
- I would not. - Sure?

153
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,116
- Yeah. - Because I've got some coconut.

154
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,056
I'm having my teeth whitened Tuesday.

155
00:07:32,056 --> 00:07:33,871
You have to get your work done by Monday...

156
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,381
which means you'll probably be here all weekend.

157
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,962
Look, if you want a promotion, you gotta earn it.

158
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,419
Now, what do I keep saying?

159
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,054
Life is a marathon, and you cannot win a marathon...

160
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,513
without putting a few Band-Aids on your nipples, right?

161
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,222
Right.

162
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,478
Nick.

163
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,723
It's 18-year-old Scotch.

164
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,393
You don't really expect me to pour it back into the bottle, do you?

165
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,453
- Water. - Yep.

166
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,131
All right. Let's see if this thing's working. Oh!

167
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:23,303
- Oh, my God. - Oh! I'm sorry. I'm a squirter, Dale.

168
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,216
- Oh, you know what? - What?

169
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:31,603
Ah. I think I can make out our little friend right there.

170
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,762
Stop it.

171
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,516
- Somebody's circumcised. - Okay.

172
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:38,526
- Listen. - What?

173
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:42,610
- Can we stop doing this thing here? - Why? Because you have a girlfriend?

174
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,609
She's not just my girlfriend anymore. We're engaged now.

175
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,619
- What? - We're engaged.

176
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,866
You said that she was just a hole for your dick.

177
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,956
I never said that.

178
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,370
Not really my style.

179
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:58,921
Shut up.

180
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:01,800
That's a lot of gas.

181
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,053
- That's good. No, those are great ideas. - Yeah?

182
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,301
- Put them down on paper, will you? - Will do.

183
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,102
- You're happy here, aren't you? - Yeah, of course.

184
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,979
Good.

185
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,933
You got a bright future here, you know?

186
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,027
Someday soon, it'll be you running this place.

187
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,113
- See you, kid. - All right, now.

188
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,112
- Drive safe. - Yeah.

189
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,872
Oh, shit.

190
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,078
He had a heart attack.

191
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:39,163
They said his, uh, heart burst in his chest like a water balloon.

192
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,167
Oh, my God. I'm sorry, man. I know you guys were close.

193
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,836
Yeah. Yeah, I loved that guy.

194
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,176
I loved working for him, you know? It was, like, awesome.

195
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:52,013
Now his shitbag son's gonna be in charge and it's like...

196
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,176
The cokehead?

197
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,017
Yeah. Know how many times I caught him doing blow at work?

198
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,500
This thing's a real bummer. Sorry.

199
00:09:57,567 --> 00:10:00,355
You're the only one of us who didn't hate his job.

200
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:04,863
Did I tell you that Harken tricked me into having a drink at 8:00 this morning?

201
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,694
I mean, I work for the Antichrist.

202
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,780
- How did he trick you? - I thought he was giving you a promotion.

203
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,366
He is, definitely. That's why he's being extra evil.

204
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,873
This is his last chance to make my life miserable.

205
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,126
Right. At least your boss isn't sexually harassing you.

206
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,082
- God. Here we go. - Don't give me shit.

207
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,872
You won't get sympathy for this.

208
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,542
She's going crazy. It's like a totally hostile work environment now, man.

209
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,130
- It's not funny. - Yeah?

210
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:31,389
All right, today she starts spraying water at my crotch to see the outline of my dick.

211
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,970
- That's great. - It's not great.

212
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,137
What are you talking about? Why don't you just, you know, fuck her?

213
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,932
Because I am engaged to be married and I love my fiancee, okay?

214
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,145
That's true.

215
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,729
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

216
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,361
What about getting a different dental hygienist job?

217
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,612
I can't get another job.

218
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,233
No, he's a child molester, Nick.

219
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:49,695
No, uh, deviant. Sexual deviant?

220
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,236
What is it? How do they classify it? Sex offender.

221
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,245
I'm on the registered sex offender list, yes.

222
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:56,800
You can't get that expunged?

223
00:10:56,847 --> 00:10:59,122
All you did was pull your dick out on a playground.

224
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,582
I was taking a piss at night, there were no kids.

225
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:06,045
All right, you know what? You don't put a playground right next to a bar.

226
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,754
- It's entrapment. Mm-hm.

227
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,756
Speaking of entrapment, I'm gonna go see that girl about her vagina.

228
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,557
Excuse me.

229
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,722
He did say 10:00, right?

230
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,974
Yeah. Do you know what this is about?

231
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,852
It just said "staff meeting" on the memo.

232
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,200
It's funny how he gets all over my ass if I'm a minute late,

233
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,524
but then he makes us wait 15.

234
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,407
- You were two minutes late. - Morning.

235
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,864
Didn't think I had to punch a clock with you.

236
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,280
I'll just attribute this to your drinking problem.

237
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,120
- I don't have... - Please, we're in the middle of a meeting.

238
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,456
Morning, everyone. So I have finally decided...

239
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:48,797
who I want to be our new Senior Vice President of Sales.

240
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,216
He's right here in this room.

241
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,516
- It's me. - What'd he say?

242
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,974
I've decided to absorb the responsibilities...

243
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,810
of the Senior VP position into my own.

244
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,567
I've realized if you wanna get something done right, you gotta do it yourself.

245
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,902
I'll break through the wall of the office that would have been the Senior VP's...

246
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,192
and make one huge enormous office.

247
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:18,660
However, I will only be taking 85 percent of the additional salary I am entitled to...

248
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,700
and that is self-sacrifice, people. Learn from it.

249
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,334
Fucker!

250
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,338
You fucking son of a bitch!

251
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,050
You are so fucking fired!

252
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,426
Yeah!

253
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,593
So, meeting adjourned.

254
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,099
- Can I speak to you? - Sure, what is it?

255
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,190
For months you've been hinting I was in line for that promotion.

256
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,354
And look how hard you've been working.

257
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,398
- You were just lying to me? - Lying?

258
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:57,069
No, Nick, motivating.

259
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,909
I mean, look, we're all part of the same team here.

260
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:03,325
Plus, you know, I'm the one who's gonna be doing all the extra work.

261
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,664
You know last month you made me work so late...

262
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,501
I missed saying goodbye to my Gam Gam?

263
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,875
- Sorry, what? - My grandmother.

264
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,715
I told you I needed to see her because she was very sick.

265
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,720
You said if I left early, I'd get fired.

266
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,007
And she died before I made it to the hospital.

267
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,968
- I'm sorry. - Thank you.

268
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:27,562
I had no idea that you called your grandmother "Gam Gam."

269
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,570
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

270
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,899
I'm sorry you didn't get to say bye-bye to Gam Gam.

271
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:39,444
Really, I really am. I'm sorry.

272
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:44,286
But I needed you to work late because you are an invaluable member of this operation.

273
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,497
And I need you in the position you're in.

274
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,583
Well, tough shit, okay?

275
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,957
Been in that position for eight years. 

276
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,960
Why would I stay after being treated like this?

277
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:59,176
Well, because I'd make sure that nobody in the industry would ever hire you again.

278
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,465
Bullshit.

279
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:04,010
No, because they're gonna want my letter of recommendation, right?

280
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:09,775
So I'm perfectly willing to write that you are an insubordinate, dishonest drunk.

281
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,151
You can't do that. That's not true.

282
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:19,693
Let me tell you something, you stupid little runt.

283
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,452
I own you.

284
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,079
You're my bitch.

285
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,286
Don't walk around thinking you have free will because you don't.

286
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,793
I can crush you any time I want.

287
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:34,128
So settle in because you are here for the long haul.

288
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,816
Yo, dickwall.

289
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,902
- What the fuck? - What?

290
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,322
Three hours late. What's the deal?

291
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,901
I was at your father's funeral.

292
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:05,038
Maybe that excuse would have flown when my dad was here, but I'm in charge now.

293
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,995
That excuse wouldn't make any sense if your dad was still here.

294
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,869
In my office, now.

295
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,670
Yes?

296
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,047
All right, sit.

297
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,712
- I'm not a dog, Bobby. - Good boy.

298
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:24,132
I've been looking through the books. You're the accountant. Tell me...

299
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,926
- why is this company in the crapper? - Well, we're not.

300
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,346
- It's a recession, but we're still profitable. - Bullshit.

301
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,105
Look, I know you and my dad were pals.

302
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:36,566
Frankly, I always thought it was, uh, weird, it was gay.

303
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,196
- Do you know what that word means? - Yeah, it's dick on dick.

304
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,528
It ain't my bag. I thought it was a little bit weird...

305
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:44,035
that my dad thought you were so fucking special.

306
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,537
But that doesn't matter now, he's in the ground.

307
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,540
I'm your boss. And there's gonna be some changes around here.

308
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,793
- Can't wait to hear them. - First things first.

309
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,578
Hospital bills, Larry Murinsky.

310
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:57,044
Why the fuck are we paying his hospital bills, he doesn't even work here?

311
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,210
He doesn't work here because he had a horrible accident in our warehouse.

312
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,630
- All right? The guy burned off half his face. - Exactly.

313
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,174
I don't want my money going to support monsters.

314
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,470
He's not a monster. He's a great guy who worked for us for many, many years.

315
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,356
Cut him off. Second.

316
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:16,397
EnviroTech Waste Management. It's costing us a lot of money.

317
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,982
Your dad chose to dispose of our waste responsibly.

318
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,988
To do that, you gotta spend money.

319
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,866
Fuck that. The Bolivians are gonna do it for a third of the price.

320
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,993
- I'm gonna hire them. - No, you can't go to them.

321
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,825
I Will. I think I Will.

322
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,864
They're gonna endanger local residents.

323
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:33,285
Oh, I give a fuck some tribesman gets cancer. Cry me a fucking river.

324
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,294
They're not tribesmen. It's a modern society.

325
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,875
Do I look like I fucking care?

326
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,502
Your dad told me very clearly he would rather die...

327
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,542
than save money and hurt people, okay?

328
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,259
Well, guess what, looks like we're right on schedule, doesn't it?

329
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,592
What else? Gotta trim some of the fat around here.

330
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,886
What do you mean by "trim the fat"?

331
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,271
- I want you to fire the fat people. - What?

332
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,978
They're lazy, and slow and they make me sad to look at.

333
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,314
You can start with Large Marge. Marge, can you come in here, please?

334
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:02,481
No, Margie's not fat, she's pregnant. I'm not gonna fire her.

335
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,069
Well, fine.

336
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,735
stay where you are, Marge. Congratulations.

337
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:11,373
- You can fire, uh, Professor Xavier. - Who are you talking about?

338
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,083
- You mean Hank? - Yeah.

339
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:17,462
He creeps me out, rolling around all day in his special secret chair.

340
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,668
- He's up to something. - I won't fire anyone.

341
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,878
- You're not? Oh, really? - Yeah, really.

342
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,464
It's like you don't care about this company at all.

343
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,900
No fucking shit I don't care about this company.

344
00:17:26,902 --> 00:17:28,177
This is just an ATM to me.

345
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,809
You think when I was a kid I dreamed of running a fucking chemical company?

346
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:36,064
No. I dreamed of being on a beach with a model sewing me tropical drinks.

347
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,771
That's what I dreamed of. That's what's gonna happen...

348
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:43,655
as soon as I squeeze the profit out of this company. But first things first.

349
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,386
You either fire the fatty

350
00:17:45,386 --> 00:17:46,626
or you fire the cripple,

351
00:17:46,626 --> 00:17:47,867
or I fire all three of you.

352
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:53,411
Decision is yours. You can phone a friend, ask the audience, fifty-fifty.

353
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:56,952
Do the math. One loses the job or three loses it.

354
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,876
Your call. I think I know who you're gonna fire.

355
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:05,172
And tell him to leave his handicap parking pass when he leaves.

356
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,344
You can't take that. It's issued by the state, Bobby.

357
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,097
Well, this is... You're looking at the state.

358
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,725
The State of Bobbyville.

359
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,352
- Okay? Deal with it. - That would be a town, Bobby.

360
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,558
United States of Me.

361
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,564
- Okay, there we go. - It's all here.

362
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,372
- Hey, Hank, how you doing, man? - Good, what's up?

363
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,918
We're going through a real tough time...

364
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,955
financially and...

365
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,135
We're gonna have to let you go.

366
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,629
Shit.

367
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,263
- I'm sorry. - Everyone.

368
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,406
Uh, can I have your attention, please? 

369
00:18:56,406 --> 00:18:58,096
I have an announcement to make.

370
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:03,894
I've just learned that Kurt has fired our dear friend Hank here.

371
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,000
I just want you all to know that

372
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:10,067
I am just as shocked and angered as you all are.

373
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,575
- What are you doing? - Please.

374
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:14,203
Enough out of you already today. My dad...

375
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,364
on the day of his funeral.

376
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,579
This is an accounting department decision. My hands are tied.

377
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,587
I'm sorry. You are one cold, heartless bastard, Buckman.

378
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:33,423
- Hank, this wasn't my idea. - Fuck you, Kurt.

379
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,901
Come in.

380
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,995
Julia, you needed to see me? Oh, shit.

381
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,415
- Will you have a seat, Dale? - Do I have to?

382
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,420
Please.

383
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,762
Sure.

384
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,139
This is a little ridiculous, but...

385
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:23,898
Look, Dale, you know, I know that I like to fool around at work. Right?

386
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,310
And I might even... You know, I might even cross the line a bit.

387
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:31,151
But the last thing that I wanna do is make you uncomfortable.

388
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,279
I mean, it's just not professional. You know?

389
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:37,821
And I pride myself on being a professional.

390
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:42,584
So from now on, what I would like you to do is just tell me, you know...

391
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:46,087
when and if, uh, I cross the line. Okay?

392
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,668
Okay. Now.

393
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,212
What?

394
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,878
Well, now, you're kind of crossing a line...

395
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,138
because you're naked.

396
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,392
Not naked, Dale.

397
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:03,725
- Can you see my pussy? - Hmm.

398
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,358
True. Um ...

399
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:12,272
But I think, uh, even really saying the word "pussy" is...

400
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,440
- That's crossing the line? - Little bit.

401
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,701
You're starting to sound like a little faggot.

402
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,580
There we go. That one's another one, probably illegal thing to say too.

403
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,286
Okay. Let's not talk about illegal,

404
00:21:23,286 --> 00:21:25,835
Mr. I-Like-To-Pee-On-Little-Boys.

405
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,542
It was an empty playground in the middle of the night.

406
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,082
Ah. That's weirder. Poor child must have been terrified.

407
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,502
There were no children. No kids in the park. Why do people think that?

408
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:38,889
You know what? Forget it. Listen, let's just out to the chase, all right, mister?

409
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,971
- You're engaged now. - Right.

410
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:45,730
And I respect the institution of marriage way too much to violate it.

411
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:49,893
So that's why you're gonna have to fuck me well before the wedding.

412
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,649
Because the closer we get to this date,

413
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:54,822
the less ladylike I'm gonna feel about it.

414
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,324
Julia, I'm not gonna sleep with you.

415
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:04,907
We'll see about that.

416
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,744
Get out.

417
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,418
Could you do the, uh...?

418
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,678
I'm a sucker. Harken wasn't gonna promote me.

419
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,557
That coked-up prick is gonna ruin Pellit Chemicals.

420
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,597
He's just gonna fire everybody.

421
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,729
She stood there with her breasts right in my face.

422
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,015
Yeah, you know, yours doesn't sound that bad.

423
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,774
I'll stop bringing it up.

424
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,981
I don't understand why you guys don't quit.

425
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,878
Julia's the only one who'd hire me.

426
00:22:34,878 --> 00:22:36,613
Are you registered sex offenders?

427
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:40,652
Going to school, changing fields, starting from the bottom. Who wants to do that?

428
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:44,789
What do I care about protecting Pellit's name when his own son doesn't?

429
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:48,042
- Gotta be a million jobs out there. - You could find another job.

430
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,623
- Is this really happening? Look at this. - Oh!

431
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:54,256
The Three Musketeers. Nick, Kurt and Dale. Look, hanging like high school.

432
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:55,667
Oh, shit.

433
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,005
- Kenny's here. - What's up?

434
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,295
- Yeah, I love this. - Kenny Sommerfeld.

435
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,338
In the flesh, boys. In the flesh.

436
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,631
Oh, my goodness.

437
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,344
Now, I heard you moved to New York, you're working at Lehman Brothers.

438
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,638
- They, uh, hired me right out of Yale. - Hell yeah.

439
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,308
- Smart Kenny. I love that shit. - What are you doing here?

440
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,900
- You read the papers? They shut us down. - Right. Sorry about that.

441
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,359
I've been looking for work for the last two years.

442
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,570
I can't even get a job waiting tables.

443
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,659
You waiting tables. I don't buy that.

444
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,617
Kenny Sommerfeld, you were voted "Most Likely to Succeed," weren't you?

445
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,498
- I mean, everyone thought you were set. - Everybody including me!

446
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,335
I'll tell you what though.

447
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,666
I would fucking murder those Lehman Brothers if I could.

448
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,502
- I don't blame you. - I bet.

449
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:39,510
Line them up, and I would put one bullet through the three of their heads.

450
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,295
That would do it.

451
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,806
- Take it easy, Kenny. - No, you guys don't understand, okay.

452
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,740
I was making the high six figures, and now,

453
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,516
I can't even pay for this fucking drink.

454
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,932
- You can't? - Well, we'll cover it, right? Dale's got it.

455
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,226
- Seriously, yeah? - Uh, I actually can't cover it.

456
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,065
- I'll do it. - Will you spot him?

457
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,229
Got some extra, maybe throw my way?

458
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,612
- Beyond the drink? - Maybe some extra scratch, if you got it.

459
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,743
- Of course. - Can you cover me? Just because...

460
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:07,200
- And I'll get you next time I see you. - Cool, thank you.

461
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,536
Kenny, I had no idea it was that bad, buddy.

462
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,247
- Do you have change for a 10? - No, I don't.

463
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,458
You know what? That's probably not gonna cut it, so I'll tell you what.

464
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,498
How about I give you guys some hand jobs?

465
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,007
- What is it? - Huh?

466
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,589
Forty bucks a piece. We'll do it right here in the bathroom.

467
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,720
All right, you guys are driving a hard bargain.

468
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,177
Since I know you, I'll let you stare into my eyes.

469
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,310
- I'll do the three of you for a hundred. - Kenny, are you gay now?

470
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,721
- No, I'm not gay! - You just do gay stuff.

471
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:35,608
I'm the opposite of gay. Now, come on. What do you say?

472
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,814
Handies for the Three Musketeers.

473
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:42,490
Come on. You know what? I'll hit the three of you at the same time.

474
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,400
Dale, I'm gonna deal with you right here behind my knee.

475
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,410
Nobody's doing that, you're gonna love it. You two, I'm gonna rock you.

476
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,742
Nordic style. You know what they're saying right now?

477
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,374
They're saying my hands are rated four stars.

478
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,393
Four stars wrapped around your stick,

479
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:56,254
pop the thumb, nick the top. Nick the top.

480
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:57,999
Nick the top, nick the top, pecker spit.

481
00:24:57,999 --> 00:24:59,586
You been drinking all day, Kenny?

482
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,437
Look at me. I know what I'm doing down there.

483
00:25:01,437 --> 00:25:03,127
Nobody will ever know.

484
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:06,012
Come on, man. I thought I told you to stay out of here.

485
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,299
I gotta go. But listen, if you guys change your mind...

486
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,638
I'm staying at my mom's house.

487
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,350
For an extra hundred, I'll let you guys pool your mayonnaise...

488
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,607
right here in my bellybutton. You'll love it. Think about it.

489
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:17,766
I'll be at my mom's.

490
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,105
Okay.

491
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,029
Oh, Kenny.

492
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:26,401
That dude banged all three of my sisters.

493
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,947
He might be looking for your brother now, you know.

494
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,040
Maybe don't quit your job.

495
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:38,462
I guess we'll be miserable for the rest of our lives? That's the deal?

496
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:41,173
- That's the way it's looking. - Why you saying that?

497
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,958
We don't have many options, do we?

498
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,086
Think about it, we can quit our jobs and turn into Kenny...

499
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:49,507
or, uh, keep our jobs and just become spineless losers...

500
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,893
that spend their entire day dreaming of ways to kill their bosses.

501
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,645
- You do that too? - Of course.

502
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,977
- Sounds a little sick. - It's not- It's just a way to blow off steam...

503
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,484
It's not like we're gonna actually kill our bosses.

504
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,111
- Good. - Ha, ha. Though you would have to admit...

505
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,319
that our lives would be a lot easier if our bosses weren't alive.

506
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:12,322
Hypothetically, if we could do it and none of us get caught, would you guys do it?

507
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,289
- No. - I would.

508
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:15,825
- No, you wouldn't. - I would.

509
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,243
- You would? - Yeah.

510
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,709
It's not murder if it's justified. Justifiable homicide, right?

511
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:22,214
I can't wait to hear this.

512
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,091
If one evil person dies for the greater good, so be it.

513
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,426
You know, Bobby Pellit is an absolute monster. He's a fucking jerk.

514
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:33,934
If he has his way, he's gonna end up killing thousands of innocent Bolivians.

515
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,140
What?

516
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,600
Technically, I think it's immoral not to kill him.

517
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:40,687
I should kill Harken for not letting me say goodbye to Gam Gam?

518
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,817
Yes. Yes, you should.

519
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,820
But I don't care how bad our bosses are. We're not murderers.

520
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,482
Julia is ruining your life, you know? That's wrong.

521
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:51,368
- That is wrong. - It's affecting your possible marriage.

522
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:52,700
Come on, she's not ruining it.

523
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,872
Would your life be easier without Julia?

524
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,782
You're right. Uh, know what I'm gonna do?

525
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,577
I'm gonna go to Julia's house, maybe I'll slash her up...

526
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:03,373
and I'll put her in a box and I'll mail it to you two, uh, tough-guy mafiosos.

527
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:07,339
I'm done with this conversation. You're paying for dinner because you've upset me.

528
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:11,050
You're paying and I'm finding a cab somehow.

529
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,807
I was just speaking hypothetically, you know.

530
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,718
Me too.

531
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:20,848
Guess who.

532
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,608
Look, I'm really kind of not in the mood for this.

533
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,356
Not in the mood for what?

534
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:26,778
- Hi. - Hi, babe.

535
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:28,530
Oh, what are you doing here?

536
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:31,738
- I invited her. - Yes. She called.

537
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,090
And she said that now that we're engaged,

538
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:36,280
she wanted to offer me free dental work.

539
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,416
- And you know I have that loose filling. - Yeah.

540
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,577
This really was so, so sweet of you, Julia.

541
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,212
Oh, please. Come on, Stacy, it's my pleasure.

542
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,873
You're part of the family now.

543
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:56,175
But, um, I don't know if it's a good idea, sweetie.

544
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,093
Oh, why not?

545
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:02,606
Because we're mixing pleasure with business. Business and pleasure.

546
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,391
We're taking advantage of Julia.

547
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,442
Dale.

548
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,542
There's nothing that you could do ever

549
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:10,482
that would be taking advantage of me.

550
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,450
- Okay? - So sweet.

551
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:17,121
All right, you. Let's go say we pump you full of gas, huh?

552
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,491
- Okay. - Okay.

553
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,877
Fuck me.

554
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:25,959
Ten.

555
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:27,798
Nine.

556
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,177
I don't know what you're doing with your hand.

557
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,804
- Okay. - Seven.

558
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:37,466
Put your hand in a safe place because there's sharp tools here.

559
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,101
Oh, there she goes.

560
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,271
- Come here! - What are you doing? What are you doing?

561
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,151
You're gonna give me that dong, Dale.

562
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:48,523
My dong?

563
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,653
You're gonna fuck my slutty little mouth.

564
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,986
Do you hear the words you say sometimes? I mean, who talks like that?

565
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,743
Let's have sex on top of her. Let's use her like a bed.

566
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,031
Get down, get down. Hey, hey! Get off of her.

567
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:04,418
Goddamn you! That's it, okay? You know what? That's crossing the line.

568
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,078
So I'm done, Julia.

569
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,042
So goodbye, I'm quitting. I'm done.

570
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:09,840
So goodbye, I'm quitting. I'm done.

571
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,671
I'm gonna tell her you fucked me.

572
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:13,423
What?

573
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,338
If you don't fuck me, I'm gonna tell her that you fucked me.

574
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:20,017
Okay. Tell her whatever the hell you want. She's not gonna believe you.

575
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,349
She already knows that you're a sex offender.

576
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:26,728
And I think once she gets a look at these...

577
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,518
she's gonna believe me.

578
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,980
- What is that? - Do you remember your first week here?

579
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,399
When I changed the crown on your second bicuspid?

580
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,691
Yeah.

581
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:41,368
Well, I just, uh, took a few pictures of the procedure.

582
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,453
DALE; on, my God. Right?

583
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,035
Oh, no. What?

584
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:51,415
You did all this while I was unconscious?

585
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,504
Ooh. Mm-hm. Yep.

586
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,175
That's my favorite.

587
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,384
- Rape. - What?

588
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,720
Rape. That's a rape. This is what raping is.

589
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,476
You're a raper and you've raped me. That's a rape! Rape!

590
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,058
Just relax there, Jodie Foster.

591
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,023
Your dick wasn't even hard.

592
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,899
That does not give me any relief.

593
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,777
But it will be next time, and if it is not...

594
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:17,487
this little sweetheart right here is gonna get a peek at my little photo album.

595
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:23,618
So please prep the patient for the bitewing x-ray.

596
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,116
I'll be back in a jiffy.

597
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,213
I'm in. Let's kill this bitch!

598
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,725
- What bitch? - "What bitch"? Guys, my boss.

599
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:47,138
Our bosses need to die. You were right, man. We should do this thing.

600
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:50,353
We were drinking last night. You said that killing is wrong.

601
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:54,770
I know. That was before Julia tried to fuck me on top of Stacy's unconscious body.

602
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,062
- Really? - Yes, dude.

603
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:59,608
She's gone fucking batshit crazy. She took a bunch of photographs of me...

604
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:02,449
- Where are they? - They'll ruin my life. I can't show them.

605
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,455
- It's a whole thing. You guys in or out? - I was in last night.

606
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,662
- Nick, what do you say? - Please. Let's go.

607
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:08,871
Nick, come on.

608
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:12,288
Seriously. I mean, uh, what about your grandma, you know? Bubbe.

609
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:13,751
- Gam Gam. - Whatever it is.

610
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:16,008
She didn't get to say goodbye to her grandson.

611
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:19,010
Because his dickbag of a boss wouldn't let him leave. Right?

612
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:22,469
- What would Gam Gam want you to do? - She wouldn't want me to kill him.

613
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,510
Okay, forget about Gam Gam. She's dead. You gotta accept that.

614
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,519
This is about you, Nick. Okay, what do you want?

615
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,597
Well, obviously I want him gone.

616
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,516
- Exactly. So let's do this. - Right?

617
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,977
- How do we do this? - I thought about that.

618
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:38,647
Stacy and I, we watch a ton of Law & Order. Huge Law & Order buffs.

619
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,909
There's all sorts of ways the bad guys on the show mess up, right?

620
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,946
They leave behind skin cells and, uh, bullet casing...

621
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:46,159
Sperm.

622
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,415
- Most of the time, it's sperm. - Silent killer.

623
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,450
Anyway, that's not the point. Point is...

624
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,666
we're not qualified. We gotta hire a professional.

625
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,838
- Are you talking about a hit man? - Yeah.

626
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,999
That's a really good idea.

627
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,669
Yeah. We don't clean our own apartments or cut our own hair.

628
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,463
- No, we pay someone to do that. - Yeah.

629
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:05,640
Well, I don't actually. Stacy cuts my hair.

630
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,934
- She does? - Yeah.

631
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,687
- She have training for that? - Doesn't need it.

632
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,143
She might.

633
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,891
And where are you gonna find a hit man?

634
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,186
Why don't you guys leave that up to me, okay?

635
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,650
I got this whole thing figured out.

636
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,066
I'm gonna give you a call tomorrow,

637
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:24,319
I'm gonna tell you where to meet me.

638
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,031
Why don't you just tell us now?

639
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:32,334
I don't have it all figured out. I got some of it figured out.

640
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,335
- Okay. - I'm gonna go home and start.

641
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,168
Okay. All right. I'm gonna go home too.

642
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,503
Well, you are. This is your house here.

643
00:32:39,503 --> 00:32:41,500
Oh. I couldn't tell that by the way

644
00:32:41,505 --> 00:32:44,714
you go in and out of my fridge drinking all my fucking beer.

645
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,885
- No, no.     - Enjoy.

646
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,121
- Were you followed? - Why would I be followed?

647
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,409
People follow people in these types of situations. Sure you weren't?

648
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:14,622
Oh, boy. What people?

649
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,912
Just take one quick look around, make sure.

650
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,501
- Let's put this down. - Look around, make sure some...

651
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,416
- Calm down! - That's what you get.

652
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,836
Shut the door, take the chain off and let me in.

653
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,925
- I pissed him off already. - Already?

654
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,058
What the hell's going on, huh? What are we doing here?

655
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:31,890
I don't want an assassin in my apartment.

656
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,271
Don't want this guy knowing where we live.

657
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,204
Hang on, you guys already went ahead

658
00:33:36,204 --> 00:33:37,979
and found someone and he's coming here?

659
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,439
- Oh, bigtime. - Not "we." Dale, all by himself.

660
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,900
It was easy. Easy as buying a used futon.

661
00:33:42,909 --> 00:33:44,277
You found a hit man online?

662
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,862
Yeah. They don't write "hit man," right? That's dumb.

663
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,450
They use code words, like wet work, right? Liquidation. Check him out.

664
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,910
"Skilled professional with years of experience..."

665
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:55,075
in domestic and international wet work.

666
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,336
"Discreet. No children, no political figures."

667
00:33:57,494 --> 00:34:00,464
That last part was important. I saw that, I thought, "This is a good idea."

668
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,921
I feel we should've got a cheese plate for this guy.

669
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:05,301
- 20/20 hindsight. - Is that him?

670
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,134
- Oh, shit. - Yeah, that was definitely a car.

671
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:15,145
- He looks like James Bond. - He really does, dude.

672
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,305
Bet he carries a gun you screw together.

673
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,308
Those are, like, the coolest guns they make.

674
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,693
So dangerous. What if that is an undercover cop?

675
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,398
- Come on. - What if it's the real thing?

676
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:26,532
He charges so much we can't afford it, gets pissed, kills us.

677
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,442
- Kills all three of us? Hold on. - That's a thing?

678
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,655
Could that happen?

679
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,488
- Gotta let him in. - How's my hair?

680
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:35,703
- What do you mean? - It doesn't matter. Let's do this. Okay.

681
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,412
Ready?

682
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,671
Yeah?

683
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,006
Are you Dale?

684
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,883
I am the one they call Dale.

685
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:54,142
Please come in.

686
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,144
Thank you.

687
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:02,025
Are all three of you participating in this?

688
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,275
- Yes. - Well, um ...

689
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,312
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep. Yep. - Yes.

690
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,105
Very well.

691
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,991
Now, before we go any further...

692
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,620
I need to know if there are any hidden recording devices in the room.

693
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,701
I will find out if there are.

694
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:19,494
I'm sure you would, but there's none because that would be stupid of us.

695
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,707
- That's a silly move. - It's a no.

696
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,503
Then let's get started.

697
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,836
- I love this guy. - This is the real deal.

698
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,005
- His voice, you kidding? - This guy is legit.

699
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:35,426
And you do know that we just wanna start with a...?

700
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,762
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, wait, what's this for?

701
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,396
- For the mess. - What?

702
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,148
Wouldn't wanna leave a stain, now.

703
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,309
- Oh, my God. I knew it. - Who's first?

704
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,820
- "Who's first"? No. - We don't want you to kill us.

705
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,107
We want you to kill another person. If anyone's first, probably him.

706
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,320
No. Goddamn it.

707
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,952
Gentlemen, gentlemen, what are you talking about?

708
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,912
Your ad said you do wet work.

709
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,073
That's correct.

710
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:00,208
I urinate on other men for money.

711
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,914
- What was that? - What'd he say?

712
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,704
I think he said he pisses on dudes.

713
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:07,500
Why else do you think my ad was in the "men seeking men" section?

714
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:09,964
Where was it?

715
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,003
- You fucking idiot. - Could you be dumber?

716
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,390
- Why look in the "men seeking men"...? - We are men looking for a man!

717
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,471
How do people let you work on their teeth?

718
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:20,012
They don't, actually. I just hand the tools to Julia.

719
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,800
Are you telling me that I've driven all this way

720
00:36:22,804 --> 00:36:24,607
and nobody wants to get pissed on?

721
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,268
Well, it's not our thing.

722
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,435
Sorry about that.

723
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,947
Can I use your toilet? I stored up rather a large amount of pee for this.

724
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,905
Sure. Yeah, it's right through there. Knock yourself out.

725
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:36,911
Oh, and by the way, I still will want my $200.

726
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,367
- Understandable. - We insist.

727
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,783
- Two hundred, huh? A bargain. - To kill three people?

728
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,418
- I thought it was such a good deal. - Dipshit. Unbelievable.

729
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:46,038
I'll be in the car.

730
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,298
Okay, but you guys are gonna chip in for the...

731
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,005
Am I gonna have to give him all my money?

732
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,675
Sir, I'm going to leave your money on the bed.

733
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,518
God, he would have drenched us.

734
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,856
Okay, I'm gonna take the blame on that one.

735
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,567
- You bet your ass you will. - You should take the blame.

736
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,574
- It was an honest mistake. - That's not how you find a killer.

737
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,282
- Oh, you know how to find a killer? - Yeah, I bet I...

738
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:19,697
Yeah, hey, you know what? Yeah. I got an idea.

739
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:20,989
What are you doing?

740
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,157
What are you doing?

741
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,325
Good evening, Mr. Buckman.

742
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,711
Thank you for contacting Nav Guide. My name is Gregory.

743
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,622
How may I be of service this evening?

744
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:32,668
Yeah, we're looking for the most dangerous bar in the city. Can you help us, please?

745
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,677
- We're going to dinner. - I'm sorry?

746
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:38,340
Looking for a bar filled with criminals. Lowlife thugs, hard-core shitheads.

747
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,850
- What do you got for us? - Let's go to a restaurant.

748
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:44,730
I'm afraid our listings are not organized by danger, sir.

749
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:47,858
I see there's an Applebee's three blocks from your location.

750
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,563
- Perfect. - No, not really helpful.

751
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:52,400
They're not the kind of shitheads we need. Anything else?

752
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,439
I could direct you to a neighborhood...

753
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,279
with the greatest number of cadackings.

754
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,240
- Now we're thinking outside the box. - I wanna go to dinner.

755
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,904
- Love it. - That's probably right.

756
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:04,290
- Very good, sir. - You may wish to lock your doors.

757
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:13,129
- This is worse than getting pissed on. - Shh.

758
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,293
- I'd rather be pissed on. - Jesus.

759
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,179
You weren't kidding, Gregory. This is, uh, a bad part of town.

760
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,636
You can stay on the line. You're still there?

761
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,769
- I'm still here, sir. - Just keep, uh, keep us on the line.

762
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:27,272
I'm always curious about these things, but is your real name Gregory?

763
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:31,560
Uh, no, sir. My real name is Atmanand.

764
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,069
How do you get Gregory from that?

765
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,526
Oh. Gregory was assigned to me...

766
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,191
- .-.by Nev Guide- - Why not let you use your real name?

767
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:41,578
They say many Americans find our real names hard to pronounce.

768
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,704
I'm not gonna play by their rules anymore.

769
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,911
From now on, I'm gonna call you Ahmenan.

770
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:47,951
- Atmanand. - Ammenand.

771
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,915
- Atmanad. - Atmanand.

772
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,581
I'm gonna call you Gregory, that name's a nightmare.

773
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,875
- Hey, baby. - Oh, boy.

774
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,759
- You hurt his feelings. - I didn't.

775
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,920
You have arrived at your destination, sir.

776
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:02,432
- All right. Well, thanks, Gregory. - You're welcome.

777
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:11,266
All right. All right, here we go.

778
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,977
- This is a really bad idea. - This is a great idea.

779
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:17,317
- Gonna yell "anybody here kill for money"? - No.

780
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,733
- That's a terrible plan. - Follow me. I got this.

781
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,277
- Where you going? - I don't feel we should stay.

782
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,070
All right.

783
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,291
- Bowflex? - Shut up.

784
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,290
My man.

785
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:39,795
Hey, uh, does anyone here kill people for money?

786
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,463
- Kurt. - The fuck you just say?

787
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,051
No, it's not a race thing.

788
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:46,468
Uh, I believe that society discriminates and disenfranchises you folks.

789
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,886
- "You folks"? - Subtle.

790
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:51,647
Man, I'm a small-business owner. Who the hell you calling disenfranchised?

791
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,979
Well, not you in particular, in that instance.

792
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,895
- Oh, right. You mean all black people. - Yes.

793
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,234
- I'm gonna be in the car. - Oh, a baseball bat.

794
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,571
Uh, I didn't mean to offend you. I'm sorry if that's what happened.

795
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,577
My heart's in the right place.

796
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:07,330
In five seconds, your heart gonna be in the wrong place.

797
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,162
- Four, three, two, let's roll. - Got it. Okay. Take care.

798
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:11,952
Have a nice day. Good day to you.

799
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,870
Bye, baby.

800
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:18,841
Don't say a word. I know, I know.

801
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,593
Hit the button. Hit the button.

802
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,880
- Guys, I don't know. Should we quit? - Yeah, definitely.

803
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:25,674
- Yo. Think I can help you boys. - Is that for us?

804
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:29,344
- Here we go. - Not interested, thank you.

805
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,058
Let's follow a strange guy into a dark corner.

806
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,775
Somebody said y'all looking for somebody to help with business.

807
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:46,161
Yep. 

808
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,037
- are you a businessman? - Yeah.

809
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,698
Motherfucker Jones.

810
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:53,452
- How's that? - Motherfucker Jones.

811
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:57,126
Your first name is Motherfucker?

812
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,000
Not Motherfucker. Motherfuckah.

813
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,257
White people say "er." Negroes say "fuckah."

814
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,547
- Got it. - You say E-R. I say A-H.

815
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,384
Cool name. Yeah. Is that, like, on your birth certificate too?

816
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,893
No, goofball.

817
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,103
My real name is Dean.

818
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:15,981
Dean Jones. Same name of the actor in Herbie, the Love Bug.

819
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,357
He won't know who that is.

820
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:19,565
- I know who he is, bitch. - Sorry.

821
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:23,322
I can't walk around in this fucking neighborhood with that Disney-ass name.

822
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,233
How'd you get the name Motherfucker?

823
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,070
When I was a kid, I snuck into my mother's bedroom.

824
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:36,502
- She was sleeping on the bed. - She had been drinking all night.

825
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,629
- I've heard enough. - Her skin was glistening.

826
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:42,509
- And I snuck up behind hen - Dean.

827
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,586
And I slipped my fingers...

828
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,882
- ...Into her purse. - Purse? He said "purse."

829
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:52,932
- And I took all of her money. - And it was her week's pay.

830
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:54,937
- I really fucked her over. - Motherfucker!

831
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:58,646
And that's how I got the name Motherfucker Jones.

832
00:41:58,808 --> 00:41:59,855
Right.

833
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,988
They should call you Motherfucker-Over Jones to avoid confusion.

834
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,274
- What's the confusion? - There's no confusion.

835
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,614
We're gonna get back on track here. Sir, we each have a boss, uh...

836
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,777
that, you know...

837
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:13,915
There's three bosses, and it would be best if those bosses maybe were no longer ...

838
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,243
- No longer around anymore. - We want them...

839
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:19,504
You know? ...killed.

840
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,622
You got the cheese?

841
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:25,843
We got the cheese. What kind of cheese are you thinking?

842
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:28,721
- What is that, three hits? That's ... - Yeah.

843
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,309
- Thirty large. - Whoa.

844
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,641
- Hungry. - That's a lot of cheese.

845
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:36,975
Oh, here's an idea.

846
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,891
If you kill two, could we get the third one hold the cheese?

847
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:43,278
It's no negotiations. Thirty large or nothing.

848
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:46,861
- That's more cheese than we've got. - Okay, then... It's five large now.

849
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:52,362
Then We're in. We're in. We're in. Right?

850
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,092
Hang on. Wouldn't it be awful

851
00:42:54,092 --> 00:42:55,657
if it was traceable back to us?

852
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,166
I don't even know your names.

853
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,248
- That is rude. This is Dale. - Don't say my name.

854
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:03,290
Shut the fuck up. Listen. Bring the money here tomorrow, I'll take care of the rest.

855
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:06,335
Do you want it in something specific, a shoebox, duffel bag?

856
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,879
- Just be here with the fucking money. - Yeah.

857
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:11,423
- Put it in a briefcase. - Thanks for your time.

858
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,636
Here we go.

859
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:14,016
Is the briefcase coming out of your end?

860
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,572
Looks like it's all there.

861
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:55,110
Didn't even need a briefcase. It's a smell stack.

862
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,950
- We should have used a manila envelope. - It's all right.

863
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:01,992
What is your projected outside date of completion, Motherfucker?

864
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:09,256
I just got back from doing a dime for some real nasty shit.

865
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,962
- That's 10 years. - I know.

866
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:14,254
They're looking at me. I'm on probation, and if I step out of line...

867
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:17,344
I'm going back.

868
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:20,268
- Right. - Understood.

869
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,646
- Period? End of story? - What does that mean?

870
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:27,274
- Wait. You said you'd take care of this. - Yeah, I'll take care of it.

871
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,862
I'm gonna be your murder consultant.

872
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:34,778
I'm sorry, but, uh ...

873
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:37,302
No, man. Right? That's not cool. 

874
00:45:37,302 --> 00:45:39,663
You don't shut this fucking hamster up ...

875
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,868
- Don't call me a hamster now. Come on. - Easy, easy.

876
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:44,284
- It's just upsetting. - No, it's somewhat accurate.

877
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,498
Look, that is not what we talked about, Motherfucker.

878
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:49,665
So how about we just take the money and we'll get out of here?

879
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,832
How about you go fuck yourself? No refunds.

880
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,836
That's $5000. If you think we're just...

881
00:45:53,836 --> 00:45:55,674
gonna walk out and let you keep that...

882
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,510
I think you're forgetting... Don't go grabbing quickly.

883
00:45:58,673 --> 00:45:59,674
Jesus.

884
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,219
Mr. Motherfucker, please, don't shoot us. Let's just talk it out.

885
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:05,684
Listen, $5000 is mine. I don't care what you say.

886
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,190
You can take my advice or get the fuck out of here.

887
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,522
- That's a terrible deal. - We should listen.

888
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:12,653
- Okay, $5000 worth of advice? - Yeah.

889
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:14,234
Most killers are first-timers.

890
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:16,172
You wanna pull off a brilliant murder,

891
00:46:16,172 --> 00:46:17,947
you gotta act like it's an accident.

892
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:21,204
Failed brakes, gas leaks, suicide.

893
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:24,411
You do it right, you ain't even gotta be there when it goes down.

894
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:27,167
Oh, boy. That's five grand worth, huh?

895
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:30,338
- Pretty pedestrian. - Not really. Obvious information, isn't it?

896
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,796
Sounds like Scooby-Doo. How are we supposed to fake three accidents?

897
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,050
You stalk your prey.

898
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,297
Gotta be smart. Find out where they live,

899
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:39,385
find out their habits. What's their hobbies?

900
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,300
What they like, what food they like, who they fucking.

901
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,184
- Word. - Find them vulnerable.

902
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:47,768
- I have a job, you know? - What's that, surveillance and recon?

903
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:51,560
That's why we were hiring, because we wanna sub that out. We have jobs.

904
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:54,320
Even if you pull it off perfectly...

905
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,068
if you crackers got motives...

906
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,232
the popo...

907
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:00,447
- That's police. - ...will pin it to you.

908
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:03,237
We all have clear motives for killing our bosses...

909
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:06,408
so this is not gonna work. This is garbage.

910
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,080
I got it.

911
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:11,128
Why don't you kill each other's bosses?

912
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,465
- That's actually a good idea. - It's not bad.

913
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:21,130
Yeah, like Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train, right?

914
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:22,759
I didn't see that. They do that?

915
00:47:22,759 --> 00:47:24,221
Danny DeVito movie. It's funny.

916
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:27,933
That famous Alfred Hitchcock, Danny DeVito movie. That's the one he's...

917
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,393
Come on. You're thinking of Throw Momma From the Train.

918
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,604
- That's what it is. - That I saw.

919
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:34,895
Good movie. That's what you're thinking about.

920
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:38,406
Same idea, though. We kill each other's bosses, there's no link to us.

921
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,817
Exactly. Five thousand dollars well spent, right?

922
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:43,281
- No. Not at all. - Waste of money.

923
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:45,117
Well, too fucking bad.

924
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,576
Get out.

925
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:51,415
Hello.

926
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,501
Hey. I'm outside. You ready to do a little recon?

927
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:59,009
Yep. Yeah. I have to get Harken to let me leave a little bit early.

928
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:02,138
What's the difference? Not like he'll be your boss much longer.

929
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:03,931
I'll be down in three minutes.

930
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,843
Three minutes it is. Bye. He'll be down in three minutes.

931
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,307
Dude, these seats are crazy comfortable. 

932
00:48:09,307 --> 00:48:11,606
Look at this. I know, it's so good.

933
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:15,146
The worst report I have ever read in my life, you nimwit.

934
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,027
You're such a fucking dweeb.

935
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:21,866
Do you have a parking space? Because I'm gonna take it away from you.

936
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:25,073
Who is it, like your mother-in-law that knows my wife?

937
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,364
How you got this fucking job, I don't even understand.

938
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,959
What the hell?

939
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,255
Sorry, everybody. I've been fighting that bug all day. Let me get back to work.

940
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,358
No, no, no. You're disgusting. Go home.

941
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:44,298
I don't want you getting anyone else sick.

942
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,181
Probably best.

943
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:50,474
Take all your work with you and have it on my desk 6 a.m. Monday.

944
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:53,139
- You got it. Thank you, Mr. Harken. - Jesus Christ.

945
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:56,525
- Don't forget to take your fucking trash can. - Yeah. No, that's mine.

946
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:59,107
You goddamn barfing pig.

947
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,025
Evens are over here.

948
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:08,412
I know, but sometimes on some streets evens are on the opposite side.

949
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:09,618
Never.

950
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,033
Never have and they never will. There it is, 428.

951
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,793
- Which one, which one? - Don't stop right in front of it.

952
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,705
Stop right here. Right here, right here.

953
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,334
Okay, boys.

954
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:26,176
We wait till Pellit makes a move, then we tail him, all right?

955
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,931
- It is on like Donkey Kong. - Ha, ha.

956
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,718
- Hells yeah, man. - Here we go, huh?

957
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,059
- Fire that the other way next time, okay. - Is my breath bad?

958
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:38,442
- Yeah. Find some gum or lean back. - I had a falafel.

959
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:42,989
You had a shawarrna, right? It's like a lamb mistake.

960
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:45,115
- Where'd you get a falafel? - Mickey's.

961
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:48,073
Mickey's has falafels? No kidding.

962
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,657
Why don't you lean back?

963
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,847
Because he parked right in front of a tree.

964
00:49:51,847 --> 00:49:53,457
If I lean back, I can't see the house over there.

965
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:57,246
Stop exasperating on me, or watch your H's.

966
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,081
Through the nose stinks too, okay?

967
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:02,799
I hate that angle.

968
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,257
We should probably get lower. If he sees three guys...

969
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,297
- Slouch down a little. - I'm gonna get back.

970
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:10,592
- You're gonna back your seat up? - If you get in your seat...

971
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,260
I can back my seat up.

972
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:15,475
I don't really have a good angle from here because there's that tree.

973
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:17,732
- You got a whole window to look through. - I'm coming up.

974
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,439
- Come on, lean back. - I like the three man thing.

975
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,437
What are you doing, Kurt?

976
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:25,986
- What's going on? - He's fucking around, man.

977
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,463
Creating a finger web in front of your face.

978
00:50:28,463 --> 00:50:30,779
Is that...? Is that like a camouflage?

979
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:33,118
It is his boss. I mean, he's the one who's going to get recognized.

980
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,374
Finger-flage. It's called finger-flage.

981
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:38,207
Finger-flage. This is actually a pretty damn good idea, dude.

982
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:40,838
Just roll up your window. Please, I can't... I can't...

983
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:43,545
- Do the finger-flage. - Let's not have jokes for two hours.

984
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,960
- This is serious business. - This is fun.

985
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:52,134
Oh, my God. I cannot believe how much this sucks.

986
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,849
I don't get it, man. On TV, surveillance always looks fun, right?

987
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:59,686
You know, the cops, they got the sunflower seeds and the coffee.

988
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,850
Talk about their lives and shit. And then...

989
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:05,567
You know, right when someone reveals something really intimate, the perp appears.

990
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,823
- They spring into action. - Yeah.

991
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:12,578
Are we even sure this guy's home?

992
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:21,204
- Let's go check this out. - Yeah, we should probably look, right?

993
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:26,257
Oh, my God.

994
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,215
What do you wanna do? What's the plan?

995
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:30,192
Let's look through this window right here.

996
00:51:30,192 --> 00:51:32,007
No, no. No, let's ring the bell.

997
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,736
You're not gonna ring the bell.

998
00:51:33,736 --> 00:51:35,301
Look through the window right here.

999
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:38,721
Chances are, he's not home. I haven't seen any activity in this house...

1000
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:41,857
What are you doing? You're not gonna ring the doorbell.

1001
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:51,617
- Come on. Come on. - Dale, Dale, Dale.

1002
00:51:58,407 --> 00:52:00,375
I didn't make it in.

1003
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:06,791
I'm sorry, guys. Didn't make it in.

1004
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,049
You in?

1005
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:11,712
Yeah, I'm okay. Jesus Christ, the guy owns a fucking bear?

1006
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:15,596
- We're breaking and entering here. - I know. Shh. Oh, look at this.

1007
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:19,307
Look at this place. It's awful. It's like a douchebag museum.

1008
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,557
It's like we stepped inside the mind of an asshole.

1009
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,230
Shit. He's got a foosball table.

1010
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:29,112
Dale! Don't touch anything. Get your hands off that.

1011
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:31,570
- Fingerprints. - Yeah, fingerprints.

1012
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:33,404
God. We should be wearing gloves.

1013
00:52:33,404 --> 00:52:35,077
We don't have... Oh, here. I know.

1014
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,078
Use your sleeves. Use your sleeves.

1015
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,955
- For what? - Use them for gloves.

1016
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:42,084
- Come on. - I can see my fingerprints from here.

1017
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,727
What do we do? What's the plan?

1018
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:45,212
We're here to get some intel.

1019
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:47,248
- "Intel"'? - It's short for "intelligence."

1020
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,917
- I know what it stands for. - Then why did you ask?

1021
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,465
Why are we talking about this? Let's split up.

1022
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:53,894
In and out, in and out.

1023
00:52:53,894 --> 00:52:55,160
We'll find something good, 

1024
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,428
and we're in and out of here.

1025
00:52:56,590 --> 00:53:00,220
- Stop chatting and start looking. - We're committing a crime. This is a crime.

1026
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,101
- Nick. - Yeah?

1027
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,019
Now, this would count as intel, right? 

1028
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,771
Holy shit, that's a lot of cocaine.

1029
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:12,815
Have you ever seen this much cocaine?

1030
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:15,109
That's gotta be worth, what, 10, 15,000...?

1031
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,913
Oh, I blew it. I blew that, didn't I?

1032
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:37,549
- Don't inhale. - Grab the box. I'll scoop it in.

1033
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:40,468
I really don't wanna touch it. I don't have sleeve-gloves.

1034
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,978
Get something to... Ugh. I'll scoop it in.

1035
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:44,389
So bitter.

1036
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:04,158
In the butt you go, go, go.

1037
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,752
There you go.

1038
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,000
Big scoop.

1039
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:11,211
All right, let me try this. Look out.

1040
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,341
- Yeah, that better work. - Watch out.

1041
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:15,673
There you go.

1042
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,179
- I don't know. - Go slow.

1043
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:20,887
Get on the couch. Stop helping.

1044
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,347
All right.

1045
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:30,935
In you go.

1046
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:44,077
You probably should have emptied the DustBuster first.

1047
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,168
Is that what you think?

1048
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,747
I was thinking that. On account of the dust.

1049
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:57,720
Well, I've heard of butt floss, but this is ridiculous. Ha, ha.

1050
00:54:57,878 --> 00:54:59,551
- Get a sifter, or a... - Colander.

1051
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,761
Colander would be good.

1052
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:04,009
And I'll start picking.

1053
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,349
That'll do.

1054
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:17,440
I feel like everything'll work out. I'm like a machine. Look how fast I am.

1055
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:19,904
I'm moving super fast. I can't even feel my nose.

1056
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:22,320
Wanna know what's weird? I should be panicking...

1057
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,864
..-and I am a little, but it's in a very good way...

1058
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,783
It's a good kind of panic because I feel like I wanna die...

1059
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:30,248
but I also feel very, very, very good. Yeah.

1060
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,287
Hey! What are you guys doing?

1061
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:35,082
Nothing. But before we go, I wanna take one more dump.

1062
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:38,423
Take a dump and I'm gonna do push-ups. Because I gotta get fit.

1063
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:40,804
What the hell have you guys done?

1064
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,015
I'm feeling good, dude. Wanna help me clean?

1065
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,176
We bond over this. This is friendship stuff.

1066
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:49,813
We broke into someone's house. It's the most amazing experience of my life.

1067
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:51,400
We broke into a man's house.

1068
00:55:51,412 --> 00:55:53,852
Suddenly, I'm like an expert at sifting cocaine.

1069
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,985
It's amazing. Come here and help me with this.

1070
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:57,988
Can't believe we weren't prepared.

1071
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:00,490
That was completely dangerous, a total waste of time.

1072
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:04,074
Well, no. Actually, not a total waste of time. Look what I got.

1073
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:05,613
- Not bad, huh? - What is that?

1074
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,622
- Is this his phone? - That's his phone.

1075
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:09,287
- You steal this? - I sure did.

1076
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:12,794
I got his contacts, schedule. Weird pictures of him doing awesome shit.

1077
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,000
- Very nice. - Thank you.

1078
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,459
- No. - What do you mean, "no"?

1079
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:18,671
That's a crime. Pfft. Nope. Ha. No one said we'd be stealing.

1080
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:21,508
- This is a good grab. - We broke in! You guys did cocaine!

1081
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:24,640
- Right. Two... Three crimes. - He's all jitzed out. Ignore him.

1082
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,597
We're in the process of getting ready to kill three people...

1083
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:30,137
and you're giving me shit about stealing a phone?

1084
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:32,398
Run it by me if you'll be stealing stuff.

1085
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:33,978
- Run it by you? - Run it by me!

1086
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:37,236
- Nick, will you hold this for a second? - What are you doing?

1087
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,817
"Run"? I'm not gonna run anything by you.

1088
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,358
I'm not gonna run anything by you. Dickhead.

1089
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,777
- There's a lot of stuff in here. - I know.

1090
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:47,321
- Wanna go check out your boss now? - Yeah, I guess we should.

1091
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,909
Okay, let's do it.

1092
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:51,325
- Hold on. - You gotta take care of that.

1093
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,960
No. No!

1094
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,497
Get off me!

1095
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,507
- You don't punch the driver! - I need you back here for the brakes.

1096
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,606
Oh, shit, the brakes. I'm sorry, buddy.

1097
00:57:01,606 --> 00:57:03,546
I'm sorry. Don't punch the driver, Dale!

1098
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:05,339
I'm sorry I hit you! Get the wheel.

1099
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,007
You don't punch the driver!

1100
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:08,509
You don't punch the fucking driver.

1101
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,410
I'm coked out of my fucking brain.

1102
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:12,145
I'll punch whoever the fuck I want to.

1103
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:30,614
Let's do this, guys. Feeling good.

1104
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:33,455
- Be very quiet out there. - Calm down, Dale.

1105
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,369
You know what? Hang on a second.

1106
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:39,415
Dale? Dude, hold it. Last time the three of us did this, it was very messy.

1107
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,879
- It was awesome, exciting. - It was clunky as hell.

1108
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:46,047
Here's what we'll do. In the event that Harken is not here, just me and Kurt go in.

1109
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:48,636
You'll stay out here, not go in, and be our lookout.

1110
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,803
What? Are you kidding me? That's awesome. I love that. The lookout.

1111
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:54,097
- I don't know what the guy looks like. - Doesn't matter.

1112
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:57,391
You see anybody, just assume that it's Harken, send us a signal.

1113
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,230
- Okay? Have a seat. - Okay.

1114
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:03,068
Okay. Send a sig... I'm gonna honk the horn six times.

1115
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,857
- Goddamn it. No. - Did he say "six"?

1116
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:07,401
- Something much more subtle. - That's too many.

1117
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,990
- More subtle? Four honks? - Can you honk once?

1118
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,621
- Are you kidding? - Not at all.

1119
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,249
People honk once all the time. You'll be in and out...

1120
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:17,457
- We'll know it's you. - Come on, man. Dale, two honks.

1121
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:20,839
That kind of tone's gonna get you nowhere. All right, two honks.

1122
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:23,672
- Just two honks. A little tap, tap. - Okay.

1123
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:28,260
Two very long, very slow honks.

1124
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:33,511
- I'm gonna check this window over here. - Okay.

1125
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:41,355
- There's nothing on that side. - Yeah. I don't think there's anyone in there.

1126
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:44,316
I think he's definitely out.

1127
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:46,698
Maybe we can find a way in upstairs.

1128
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:50,281
Yeah, or maybe there's a window open.

1129
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,165
Or better yet ...

1130
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,285
That makes things easier, huh?

1131
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:00,546
I like the way you think. Move.

1132
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:02,627
- No, don't do that. Hey! God! - Oh, shit.

1133
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:04,212
I broke a rock.

1134
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:07,002
Please tell me you realize that was a key thingy.

1135
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:10,218
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1136
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,633
You weren't gonna throw a rock through the door?

1137
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,801
No, of course not. No, I wanted to open it.

1138
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,187
Like a real cat burglar.

1139
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:23,861
Just recon, now, okay?

1140
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:27,523
Hey, take this. I don't want it. I want my hands free.

1141
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,487
You broke it.

1142
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:37,078
I feel the intel...

1143
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:39,952
- God! - Okay, just a cat.

1144
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:41,165
Out of nowhere.

1145
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:44,832
Just a cat. We're all right. Let's look upstairs. Come on.

1146
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,670
# The call me hell

1147
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,176
# They call me Stacey

1148
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:54,183
# That's not my name That's not my name

1149
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:55,467
# They call me hell

1150
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:56,806
# They call me her

1151
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,265
# They call me hell

1152
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,680
# They call me Stacey

1153
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:02,520
# That's not my name That's not my name

1154
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:14,244
Oh! Goddamn it.

1155
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:16,075
Jesus, how many oats do they have?

1156
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:18,366
- It's the same one, I think. Yeah. - Really?

1157
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,867
Quick little bugger, huh?

1158
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:24,747
- Shit, is that Harken's wife? - Yeah, that's her.

1159
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:27,211
- Oh, man, she is hot. - She sure is. Here we go.

1160
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:30,503
I'd like to bend her over a barrel and show her the 50 states.

1161
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:33,547
- I don't know what that means. - Ah, it's a saying.

1162
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:37,138
- I don't think so. - No, it is, it is. Yeah. No, people say that.

1163
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,053
- I haven't heard it. - I've definitely heard people say that.

1164
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:42,439
I'm not gonna argue. Let's continue the recon.

1165
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:45,521
- Well, it's definitely a phrase. - It sure isn't.

1166
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:48,904
Yeah, it is. It's from a book. The Great Gatsby, maybe?

1167
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:52,862
Let's just look for an address book or a day planner or something. You know?

1168
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:56,946
You know, it's too bad we're not looking for cats. These people fucking love cats.

1169
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:20,260
Hey, schmuokface.

1170
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:27,768
You Wanna tell me what you're doing littering on my street?

1171
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:31,438
I think what happened, ahem, was that the wind blew it out of my hand.

1172
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:33,949
I don't care if the wind blew it out of your twat.

1173
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:38,283
Why don't you take this piece-of-shit car and get off my fucking block?

1174
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:40,368
I don't know why you're mad at the car.

1175
01:01:40,368 --> 01:01:42,291
I don't think we should get hostile now.

1176
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:44,292
"Hostile"? You wanna see hostile?

1177
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:46,124
How about I go in my house and I get my...?

1178
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:48,963
What are...? What's going on with you?

1179
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,675
Peanuts.

1180
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,627
"Penis"?

1181
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:55,629
Oh, peanuts.

1182
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:58,969
That was a peanut butter sandwich. Are you not good with peanuts?

1183
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,976
What are you pointing at? What's going on? What's here?

1184
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:04,471
Oh, I got it! What do I do? What do I do?

1185
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:08,316
"Check the needle, pump back, pump..." Okay, hold on. I'm a slow reader.

1186
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:09,977
"Hold the pump... " Okay, okay!

1187
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:12,646
Jab it in your chest. Okay. I got you, dude. Ready?

1188
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,367
How you feeling, you good?

1189
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:20,824
You good? Did I get you? Did I get you?

1190
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:27,252
Whoa. Whoa. Dude, come here. Hurry.

1191
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,957
Look at this.

1192
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:34,005
- Is that Harken? Dale's killing Harken? - That's Harken?

1193
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:36,010
I'm gonna hit you again, okay?

1194
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:38,926
- What is he doing? - He's really doing it?

1195
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:41,387
- This is the recon stage. - Holy shit.

1196
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:44,177
We gotta get out of here. Come on, we gotta go. Oh, God.

1197
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:48,473
I'm pushing on it. Okay.

1198
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:52,443
What about little jabs? Little jabs?

1199
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:53,861
Do I get your neck?

1200
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,444
Was that good?

1201
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:02,279
Come on, man!

1202
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,492
Oh, my God.

1203
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:04,914
Hey, hey! Come here!

1204
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:08,452
What's going on? What are you doing? What's happened?

1205
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:11,212
I think he's okay! I hit him with this. Do you know him?

1206
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:14,841
Of course, he's my husband. Sweetie? Honey? Sweetheart, are you okay?

1207
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,134
- There he is. Hey. - Ah. What did you do to me?

1208
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:23,267
I saved you with your thingy. It was incredible.

1209
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:25,803
Oh, my God, sweetie. He saved your life.

1210
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:27,061
You saved his life.

1211
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,434
Okay. That's cool.

1212
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,645
- What's with the hugging? - Saved your life!

1213
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:36,314
Oh, sweetie, I am just so grateful that he was here. You could have died.

1214
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,823
- I'm sure you are grateful he's here. - Yes, I am.

1215
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:40,780
- You know this guy? - No, I don't.

1216
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:44,287
Are you fucking this guy? What were you doing, waiting to fuck my wife?

1217
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:47,199
Dude, I just met your wife. You want your thing back?

1218
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:51,244
- You better get out of here. - No problem.

1219
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:53,584
Dave. Dave, what are you...? Honey?

1220
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:55,624
Honey, you should be thanking this young man.

1221
01:03:55,624 --> 01:03:57,502
Why are you being so suspicious?

1222
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,510
Why? You know why I'm being suspicious.

1223
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,137
Because I know you sleep around on me.

1224
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:03,552
That's ridiculous.

1225
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:05,183
What about the way you look at Maurilio?

1226
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:10,473
You realize We're all going to jail because of that idiot?

1227
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:13,687
Man, I can't go to jail. Look at me. I'll get raped like crazy.

1228
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,102
Fuck, me too.

1229
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:18,105
Yeah, totally.

1230
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:21,241
I'd get raped just as much as you would, Kurt.

1231
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:23,652
- Do you think you're more rape-able? - I'm not saying that.

1232
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:27,201
- You're pretty close to saying... - Oh, fuck.

1233
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:36,456
Holy shit. Did you guys see me out there?

1234
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:38,125
Yeah, we saw you, Dale.

1235
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,259
Shh. Yeah, we saw that.

1236
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:41,670
How cool was that?

1237
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:44,635
It wasn't cool at all. We come out to gather information...

1238
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:48,052
and you start stabbing Harken to death in front of the neighborhood?

1239
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:50,471
- Harken? - Who'd you think you were stabbing?

1240
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:51,809
I wasn't stabbing anyone.

1241
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:55,646
He had an allergic reaction to some peanuts and I rescued him, know what I mean?

1242
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,811
He had a little allergy shot on him and I...

1243
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:01,068
I mean, I jabbed him with that, but I was just saving his life.

1244
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:02,983
- Saved a man's life. - Hang on a second.

1245
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:05,743
So my boss, who we're thinking about planning to kill...

1246
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,405
is dying in front of you and you saved his life?

1247
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,994
Well, that sounds bad when you say it like that.

1248
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,455
- Can you open the door? - That's not cool.

1249
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:16,167
- But I didn't know it was Harken. - Hit the button.

1250
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,582
This is why I need to know what people look like.

1251
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,421
You're mad at me for killing him ...

1252
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,551
Can we give him a time-out? For one second.

1253
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:24,963
Make up your fucking mind. It's like...

1254
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:26,177
What is this?

1255
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,683
You gotta admit we got some good intel tonight.

1256
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:32,221
Harken is allergic to peanuts and Pellit's got a huge stash of cocaine.

1257
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:33,684
Are you playing this game?

1258
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:38,023
So all we gotta do is figure a way to get peanuts somewhere into Harken's house...

1259
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,107
and put some poison in Pellit's coke.

1260
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:43,399
It's easy for someone to think Pellit got a bad batch of cocaine.

1261
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:46,694
You seriously locking me out of the car like we're in 8th grade?

1262
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:49,579
What about Harken? Probably always got that injector thing.

1263
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:51,114
Doesn't shower with it.

1264
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:53,579
So then we'll put some peanuts inside his shampoo.

1265
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:56,457
A couple of fatal accidents we're not even there for.

1266
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:59,168
- Motherfucker Jones would be so proud. - Yeah, he would.

1267
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:02,004
- Getting old. - What do you do about dummy's boss?

1268
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:04,795
I'll stake her out tomorrow and get to the bottom of it.

1269
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,840
- A man has his limits. - That left a fucking dent.

1270
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,968
Get him fucking home.

1271
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:16,231
Very funny. That was very funny, guys.

1272
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:18,892
We have one thing to figure out, if you can help us.

1273
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:22,403
If Nick and I were in prison, who do you think would get raped more?

1274
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:24,446
Nick.

1275
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:27,576
Really? Why?

1276
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:30,866
It's about weakness and vulnerability- It's not a looks thing.

1277
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:32,246
It probably would be Nick.

1278
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:35,625
Getting locked out of the car is bullshit, man.

1279
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:21,917
That's an awesome deal.

1280
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,805
Jesus, Dale- It's a murder, not a cocktail party...

1281
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:33,387
I know. You don't have to announce that to the world.

1282
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:36,554
There was a great deal on nuts. I'm not gonna pass up on savings.

1283
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:37,936
Okay, so this is it.

1284
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:40,206
I'm doing Pellit, you're gonna do Harken,

1285
01:07:40,206 --> 01:07:42,317
and you'll get some intel from Julia, right?

1286
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,062
- Copy that. - Okay. See you on the other side.

1287
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:16,888
Okay.

1288
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:23,349
- Thank you, Kimmy. - You're welcome.

1289
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,105
That was great.

1290
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:27,566
- See you next time. - Yeah.

1291
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:31,108
- Thank you, Bill. - Thank you, Bobby.

1292
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:40,533
What?

1293
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:53,054
Shit.

1294
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,720
- Hey. - How's it going over there?

1295
01:08:57,050 --> 01:09:00,224
- What do you know about Julia? - I learned I gotta switch dentists...

1296
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:02,388
because this woman is unbelievably hot.

1297
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:05,729
- How's it going over there? - Uh, it's...

1298
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:10,565
Just I'm waiting for, you know, Pellit to sleep or leave or ...

1299
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:13,199
Just... Just waiting.

1300
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:16,077
Wonder what, uh, Dale's doing with Harken.

1301
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,987
It's gonna be really hard.

1302
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:20,077
And well have to work at this every day,

1303
01:09:20,077 --> 01:09:22,000
but I wanna do that because I want you.

1304
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:25,503
I want all of you forever, you and me, every day...

1305
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:45,602
Everybody was kung-fu fighting

1306
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:50,274
Everybody was kung-fu fighting

1307
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:53,948
Give me that.

1308
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:55,859
Give it to me.

1309
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:18,306
Jesus. Where does this guy get the energy?

1310
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,535
What the fuck was that?

1311
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:52,840
Okay. Okay.

1312
01:10:57,879 --> 01:11:01,179
Okay. Okay.

1313
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:09,183
- Yeah, Dale? - I don't think I can do this.

1314
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:12,690
Look, I know you really hate Harken but...

1315
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:15,404
I don't think I can go through with it.

1316
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:16,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1317
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:19,868
I know. I've been thinking the same thing.

1318
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:22,575
- Yeah, let's just call it off - What the fuck?

1319
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:24,865
- What? - It's Harken. He's here.

1320
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:26,123
He's at Pellit's? Why?

1321
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,785
I don't know. He's walking right up to the front door.

1322
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:32,001
- You think he's onto us? - How the fuck do I know?

1323
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:34,381
Knock a little louder?

1324
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,541
What? What?

1325
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:41,256
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ, Harken just shot Pellit.

1326
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:42,799
Are you sure?

1327
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:46,344
Holy shit. Pellit opened up the door, Harken shot him in the chest...

1328
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:48,684
he fell down, he shot him again in the head.

1329
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:50,621
He shot him? Wait, what's going on?

1330
01:11:50,621 --> 01:11:52,396
I don't understand. He shot him?

1331
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:54,606
Nick? Say something. Nick, say something.

1332
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:57,989
Nick! Nick, Nick, talk to me. Nick, what's happening?

1333
01:11:58,147 --> 01:11:59,239
What's going on?

1334
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:01,901
- How's Pellit doing? - Still pretty fucking dead, Dale.

1335
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:11,120
I gotta get out of here before somebody sees me.

1336
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,083
Meet me at the bar. I'll call Kurt.

1337
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:14,668
Yeah. I'll meet you there.

1338
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:18,756
I might throw up a couple times in the toilet here, but then I'll meet you there.

1339
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:23,677
Oh, Toyota.

1340
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,443
Stay calm. We'll figure this out.

1341
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,604
"Calm"? I saw a guy get shot an hour ago.

1342
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:42,275
- I know. A guy you were gonna kill anyway. - Listen, I don't know about that.

1343
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:44,114
- What? - Don't Know if I had it in me.

1344
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:46,371
I freaked out and panicked, got out of there.

1345
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:48,952
Are you kidding? You can't change a plan like this...

1346
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:50,162
I'm not a murderer.

1347
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:53,328
You think when it came down to it, you'd be able to kill Julia?

1348
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:57,340
I don't know. Maybe you're right. It is a little hard to imagine killing her now.

1349
01:12:57,498 --> 01:13:00,627
- "Now"? - Wait, what does that mean?

1350
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,386
- Did you sleep with her? - No, no.

1351
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:04,968
- Tell me you didn't sleep with her. - You're a mess.

1352
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:07,384
But this time it wasn't my fault, I swear to God.

1353
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,928
You will be a suspect if you try and kill her now.

1354
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:13,143
At first I was surveilling her, like I was asked to do.

1355
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:15,394
She's incredibly hot, by the way. So hot.

1356
01:13:15,394 --> 01:13:17,482
Don't talk about how hot she is, bastard.

1357
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:19,816
Next thing, she starts deliberately undressing.

1358
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:21,026
Come on.

1359
01:13:21,188 --> 01:13:23,156
In front of her window with the lights on.

1360
01:13:23,316 --> 01:13:25,739
- Like she knew I was watching. - "Deliberately undressed"?

1361
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:28,030
Slowly, seductively, lot of shoulder moves...

1362
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:30,072
is clearly putting on a show.

1363
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,163
- Next she makes herself a little snack. - She have a nice chest?

1364
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:34,327
A Popsicle.

1365
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:36,086
- Then a banana. - Come on.

1366
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:39,795
- And finally, a hot dog. I mean, come on. - Now I don't believe your story.

1367
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:42,836
Three penis-shaped foods, that can't be a coincidence, right?

1368
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:45,596
Eating them in that weird order? Not a proper meal.

1369
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:46,847
It's cold to hot.

1370
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:49,885
Fine. So you took the penis foods as an invitation to fuck her.

1371
01:13:50,051 --> 01:13:53,851
No, no. God, no. I took her invitation to fuck her as an invitation to fuck her.

1372
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:56,308
She lured me in. lt was like one of these things.

1373
01:13:56,474 --> 01:13:59,023
- Something clinically wrong with you. - You're a whore.

1374
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:02,029
- Come on. That's not nice, okay? - Look, your problem 's solved.

1375
01:14:02,188 --> 01:14:03,690
She won't mess with you anymore.

1376
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:06,484
Can we move on? Let's talk about what happened to Pellit.

1377
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:10,326
All right, okay. Let me think. Okay, here's what I'm thinking. Here's my idea.

1378
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:12,866
We call the cops with an anonymous tip. All right?

1379
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:15,080
We tell them Harken killed Pellit. Boom.

1380
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:16,977
Harken's in jail, Pellit's in hell,

1381
01:14:16,977 --> 01:14:18,712
Julia's had the crazy fucked out of her...

1382
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:21,044
and all three of us have our problems solved.

1383
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:23,460
It could work. An anonymous tip, that's not bad.

1384
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:27,759
Gotta be from a pay phone, though, so it's not traced back to us.

1385
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:30,971
- Exactly. - Good. Let's take my car. Let's do it.

1386
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:34,683
All right. Where do you even find a pay phone these days?

1387
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:36,813
There's a ton at the bus station for sure.

1388
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:39,772
Oh, yeah, I guess that's a good point. Maybe the mall.

1389
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:41,402
What is this?

1390
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:44,568
- What is this? - Is that for us?

1391
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:46,858
- What? - Oh, shit.

1392
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:56,413
All the way down.

1393
01:14:57,827 --> 01:14:59,420
Right there.

1394
01:15:01,122 --> 01:15:04,843
- Are you the owner of this vehicle? - I own it. Yup.

1395
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:10,424
We got an APB on a gray Toyota Prius, license 2-Whiskey-Alpha-Quincy-2-3-3.

1396
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:11,806
- How come? - Hang on, man.

1397
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:13,934
- Did I talk to you? - No.

1398
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:17,104
That's this car. Tell me how I can help.

1399
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:20,312
A traffic cam caught this car fleeing the scene of a crime tonight.

1400
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:23,944
- Would you know anything about that? - I don't know why it would do that.

1401
01:15:24,395 --> 01:15:27,365
I mean, I don't know. What happened?

1402
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:29,571
- Have you been drinking? - No.

1403
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,117
I smell alcohol.

1404
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:33,496
- This guy and the mouth in the back. - That's me.

1405
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,953
I'm gonna need you to follow us to the station.

1406
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:38,242
Officer.

1407
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:39,785
My man.

1408
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:45,967
I cannot believe I let you talk me into this whole thing. I cannot believe it.

1409
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:48,219
Are you kidding me? We were being hypothetical.

1410
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,755
- Being hypothetical? - You're the one that pushed us into it.

1411
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:55,635
Well, don't bark.

1412
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:58,933
- You know we're dead, right? - Why?

1413
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:01,315
Because they know everything. Cops are smart.

1414
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:03,818
You realize we can't even mention Harken now?

1415
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:05,319
- Yeah, I know. - Shit, dude.

1416
01:16:05,478 --> 01:16:08,231
- Wait, why? - It was supposed to be an anonymous tip.

1417
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:09,694
- Yeah, so? - Come on, man.

1418
01:16:09,857 --> 01:16:13,077
Should I just tell them the only reason I know about Harken is...

1419
01:16:17,865 --> 01:16:20,334
So should I just say that the only reason I know about Harken...

1420
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:23,212
is because I was parked in front of your dead boss's house?

1421
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:25,668
You were at the scene of the crime. It was bad then.

1422
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:27,708
You kind of fled the scene of a crime.

1423
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:29,586
That's actually a crime in and of itself.

1424
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:32,175
Shouldn't have done that. I'm the one that hasn't done anything.

1425
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:34,466
- You broke into two people's houses. - So you broke into a house.

1426
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:37,010
I followed you into a house after you broke into it.

1427
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:39,099
- You stole a blackberry. - You did cocaine.

1428
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,059
I accidentally inhaled some cocaine.

1429
01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:42,872
What are you gonna do, rat me out?

1430
01:16:42,872 --> 01:16:44,522
Maybe I will rat you out. What do you think?

1431
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:46,526
- You gonna rat me out too? - I could.

1432
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,858
You stole a blackberry. You fled a crime. You raped my boss.

1433
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:51,570
- I did not rape her. - I'll climb over and kick your ass!

1434
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:54,906
- Wanna see what happens? - Hey! Gentlemen. Gentlemen!

1435
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:56,787
- Right this way. - Yeah, let's do it. Come on.

1436
01:16:56,946 --> 01:16:58,539
Let's go in there. Let's go. Let's do it.

1437
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:02,789
Do you wanna explain why you were doing 61 in a 25 zone...

1438
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:05,171
one block from the victim's house...

1439
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:07,502
just moments after he got shot dead?

1440
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:10,335
I was drag racing.

1441
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:14,255
- I'm a drag racer. - You were drag racing?

1442
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:17,884
In a Prius?

1443
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:22,395
I don't win a lot.

1444
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:24,899
Here's what I don't understand.

1445
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:27,276
You were at the crime scene.

1446
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:28,500
Hour later we find the car.

1447
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,735
You happened to be hanging with this freaky motherfucker.

1448
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:34,741
- A registered sex offender. - It was an empty playground.

1449
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:39,030
And this guy. Who happens to be working for Pellit Chemicals, the victim's company.

1450
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:40,910
What?

1451
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:43,493
My boss was murdered?

1452
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:49,750
Oh, wow. What were you doing at his house, Nick? Why were you there?

1453
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:53,252
Where were you during the murder?

1454
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:57,799
I was making love. I was making love to a woman.

1455
01:17:57,965 --> 01:18:00,093
Yeah. Murdering some ass.

1456
01:18:01,427 --> 01:18:04,021
- Detectives ... - No, uh, I have a question.

1457
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:06,854
If one of us knew, you know, who the shooter was...

1458
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:11,362
and he was willing to serve you that perp on a platter...

1459
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:15,491
he would be entitled to some sort of immunity, right?

1460
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:18,493
No. He would be entitled to some jail time.

1461
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:21,489
If he knew who the shooter was and didn't tell us...

1462
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:23,532
that would be obstruction of justice.

1463
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:25,625
Glad none of us know who the shooter is.

1464
01:18:25,784 --> 01:18:28,332
Listen, if you think we're gonna believe

1465
01:18:28,332 --> 01:18:30,881
that this is all just a big coincidence...

1466
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,213
we're gonna be here for a long time.

1467
01:18:35,044 --> 01:18:40,096
Okay, wait. By saying "we're gonna be here for a long time"...

1468
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:43,515
you're implying that we're not allowed to leave...

1469
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:46,400
which would only be the case if we were under arrest.

1470
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,307
Are we under arrest?

1471
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:50,477
No. We just brought you in for questioning.

1472
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:54,154
Well, then, ipso facto...

1473
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:57,658
you don't have sufficient evidence...

1474
01:18:57,816 --> 01:19:00,660
constituting probable cause for an arrest warrant.

1475
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:01,820
Not yet.

1476
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:06,493
Well, uh, then, pursuant to the Fourth Amendment...

1477
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:10,963
I believe we are free to go. Are we not?

1478
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,002
Yeah, technically. Yeah.

1479
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:16,009
Technically is good enough for me.

1480
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:19,012
Gentlemen, ahem, we are free men.

1481
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:21,007
Let's go.

1482
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:23,267
We gotta get back to your car. Keep moving.

1483
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:25,894
We get a cab? Take the train? What do you wanna do?

1484
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:27,890
You ever been on a subway in this town?

1485
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:29,728
Pretty great. Where'd that come from?

1486
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:32,689
Law & Order, okay? You can learn stuff watching Law & Order.

1487
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:34,694
- We showed them, huh? - We did show them.

1488
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:36,355
You were about to turn us in.

1489
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:38,945
There was a few conversations about ratting each other out...

1490
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:40,701
but it was gonna be fine.

1491
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:42,111
Hold on.

1492
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:45,077
That's for you, hotshot. Speeding and running a red light.

1493
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:48,076
You boys don't get too comfortable out there.

1494
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:53,373
Our forensics team is sweeping the Pellit house right now for DNA and fingerprints.

1495
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:56,550
And I'll tell you something. They don't miss shit.

1496
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:03,307
In the butt you go, go, go.

1497
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:07,394
Why would you put his whole bathroom in your ass?!

1498
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:11,558
- I didn't I know I had DNA in my butt. - Lying! You know there's DNA in your butt.

1499
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:14,227
You just like shoving shit in your ass, you fucking pervert!

1500
01:20:14,393 --> 01:20:16,191
We are lawyering up, men. That's it.

1501
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:17,800
I don't have money for a lawyer.

1502
01:20:17,838 --> 01:20:20,324
I bought a very expensive ring I can't afford...

1503
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:23,406
then I gave the rest of my motherfucking money to Motherfucker Jones.

1504
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:25,196
That's who we should talk to.

1505
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:27,205
He's covered us this far, right? Five grand?

1506
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:29,366
Five thousand forty with the briefcase.

1507
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:31,828
- Shut up about that! - Shut up about the briefcase.

1508
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:37,044
Excuse me. Excuse me. 

1509
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:40,711
- Hello, Motherfucker. - Hey, look who's back. Look who's back.

1510
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:43,722
Whatever happened to that, uh, Strangers on a Train shit?

1511
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:45,554
Didn't work out. We need your help.

1512
01:20:45,716 --> 01:20:48,560
One of our intended victims killed the other intended victim.

1513
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:50,312
- Shut the fuck up. - It's gone bad.

1514
01:20:50,471 --> 01:20:52,348
You guys are some fucking evil geniuses.

1515
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:55,984
Thank you, but we had nothing to do with it. We don't know why it happened.

1516
01:20:56,143 --> 01:20:57,690
The cops bring us in as suspects.

1517
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:01,574
Kurt's DNA's all over the apartment because he shoved a toothbrush up his ass.

1518
01:21:01,732 --> 01:21:04,281
- That's not the point. - I'm giving him the whole story.

1519
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:06,571
I got you. First thing first, we gotta handle business.

1520
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:11,534
- I need $5000. - There's gonna be no more money.

1521
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,293
- Two thousand? - Absolutely not.

1522
01:21:13,452 --> 01:21:16,581
No way, Motherfucker. No.

1523
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:19,424
All right, look, pay for my drinks.

1524
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:21,130
- Pay for his drink. - I'll do that.

1525
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:22,795
Not a very good negotiator.

1526
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:26,056
The guy that killed the other guy, are the cops after him?

1527
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:28,058
No, no, they don't suspect him.

1528
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:30,140
Then this is what you need to do:

1529
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:34,807
Get him to confess to the murder while you're wearing a wire.

1530
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:36,646
A wire? We can do that. That's easy.

1531
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:39,983
That how they got you when you murdered somebody?

1532
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:46,285
- I ain't never murder nobody. - I'm sorry?

1533
01:21:46,527 --> 01:21:48,370
I never murdered anybody.

1534
01:21:48,529 --> 01:21:51,499
Wait, no. You said you did a dime for some pretty nasty shit.

1535
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:54,911
It was some nasty shit, but does that mean I murdered somebody?

1536
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:56,124
You implied it.

1537
01:21:56,286 --> 01:21:58,505
You didn't murder someone, what'd you do?

1538
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:01,258
All right, listen, get in here.

1539
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:06,672
You guys ever see the movie Snow Falling on Cedars?

1540
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:07,840
No.

1541
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:09,679
- Never seen that. - I love that movie.

1542
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:13,642
What happened was is that I took a video camera into the movie and I bootleg it.

1543
01:22:13,804 --> 01:22:16,273
They was waiting right outside the exit. They got me.

1544
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:18,480
- You did 10 years for video piracy? - Yeah.

1545
01:22:18,642 --> 01:22:21,361
- They take that shit so serious, man. - Not that seriously.

1546
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,113
We've been taking murder advice...

1547
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:26,446
from some guy whose biggest crime is taping an Ethan Hawke movie.

1548
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:29,031
- So you do know the movie. - I know who's in it.

1549
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:30,502
Everyone knows the movie.

1550
01:22:30,502 --> 01:22:31,810
That's not the point. 

1551
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:33,119
You tricked us, Motherfuck...

1552
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:37,879
Hang on a second, something doesn't stack up quite right with this, all right?

1553
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:42,337
So you just call yourself a video pirate, right? Pirating the high seas of videocy?

1554
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:45,002
Why do you Carly a gun on you, Mr. Video Pirate?

1555
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:46,671
- A gun? - Yeah.

1556
01:22:46,837 --> 01:22:48,965
- I don't wanna see it. - It's my cell phone.

1557
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:53,143
- It's a Sidekick. I'm gonna be in the car. - Oh, shit.

1558
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:55,800
You grab at it like a gun and you confuse people.

1559
01:22:55,850 --> 01:22:57,398
Goddamn it, I feel like a moron.

1560
01:22:57,556 --> 01:22:59,229
- Let's go. - You are a moron.

1561
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:04,238
Look, you don't go into a bar and hand a guy $5000 just because he black.

1562
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:06,615
- It was never a black-white thing. - No, come on.

1563
01:23:06,773 --> 01:23:08,741
Let's go. Come on. Dale.

1564
01:23:08,901 --> 01:23:10,903
Y'all motherfuckers crazy.

1565
01:23:21,288 --> 01:23:23,040
Okay.

1566
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:24,379
Looks pretty quiet, yeah?

1567
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:26,691
Yeah, it does. Okay, tape recorder's ready to roll,

1568
01:23:26,691 --> 01:23:28,842
I got some fresh batteries in here.

1569
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:32,929
It was a pretty big investment so I should be the one who does the tape-recording.

1570
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:35,310
- No way. No, I'll do it. - You're gonna do it?

1571
01:23:35,469 --> 01:23:37,517
You'll have to duct-tape that to your chest.

1572
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,102
I can't tape this to my chest. I have hair on chest.

1573
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:43,109
Just put it in your pocket. Not gonna tape it to his chest.

1574
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:45,857
So, what do we do? Wait for him to come home,

1575
01:23:45,857 --> 01:23:47,945
we grab a office chair or something?

1576
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:51,610
One of us gets in the chair, spins around and dramatically confronts him.

1577
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:53,620
- I'm in the chair. - Nick's in the chair.

1578
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:55,656
- Why are you in the chair? - He's my boss.

1579
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:59,292
Maybe we should get three chairs and all spin around at the same time.

1580
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:00,577
Confront him like that.

1581
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:03,213
That's not intimidating, that's like a musical number.

1582
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:06,083
Watch out for the cat.

1583
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:07,467
Surprise!

1584
01:24:09,795 --> 01:24:12,389
Okay. It's a false alarm- Just mingle, mingle, mingle...

1585
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:13,800
Hi. Who are you?

1586
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:15,809
Come inside. Close that door. Hurry.

1587
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:17,811
Um, okay. Now, wait a minute.

1588
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:21,315
You're the young man who helped Dave out on the street the other night.

1589
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:23,771
- That's him. - Yeah, that's who I am.

1590
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:27,905
- How is he? - He is great, thanks to you. Thank you.

1591
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,653
- Did I invite you? - You did and you didn't.

1592
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:32,659
I work with your husband. We're late.

1593
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:34,946
- These are my plus-twos. - He's in the garage.

1594
01:24:35,112 --> 01:24:37,160
Oh, we should hide. Everybody, come on in.

1595
01:24:38,156 --> 01:24:42,127
- Someone get the lights. - Get down, get down, get down.

1596
01:24:42,995 --> 01:24:46,795
I'm Kurt, by the way. I didn't get a chance to introduce myself at the door.

1597
01:24:46,957 --> 01:24:50,086
- Oh, hey, Rhonda. Hi. Hi. - Hi, Rhonda. Very nice to meet you.

1598
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:52,843
Nick didn't tell me his boss was married to a model.

1599
01:24:53,005 --> 01:24:55,133
Ha, ha. Yeah, not a model.

1600
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:58,181
When did you quit?

1601
01:25:02,723 --> 01:25:04,725
Surprise!

1602
01:25:04,891 --> 01:25:07,189
Goddamn it! God, I hate that!

1603
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:08,569
We got you, huh, honey?

1604
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:11,736
- So you were surprised? - Yeah.

1605
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:13,195
Look, sweetie, everybody's here.

1606
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:16,119
I'm gonna put my stuff down.

1607
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:19,031
She knows I hate surprises.

1608
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:22,914
I think we got him. Ha, ha. We got him good.

1609
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,712
Okay.

1610
01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:28,294
He's gone off on his own. This is our chance.

1611
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:30,209
- You guys ready? - Yeah, very ready.

1612
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:32,173
- Stay close, okay? Mm-hm.

1613
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,967
Let's do it. Let's do it.

1614
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:38,141
Harken.

1615
01:25:39,343 --> 01:25:41,095
I cannot believe my wife invited you.

1616
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:44,185
What are you doing here? Come to stab me a few more times?

1617
01:25:44,348 --> 01:25:46,897
- We know what you did. - Well, what does that mean?

1618
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:49,153
We were there. We saw you kill him.

1619
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:51,439
Really?

1620
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:54,741
So, what is this, then? Your little Shakedown?

1621
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:58,658
You think that you can blackmail me...

1622
01:25:59,237 --> 01:26:02,537
because you saw me kill my wife's lover?

1623
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:04,914
Say his name!

1624
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:08,296
What?

1625
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:11,216
The man you killed, you say his name.

1626
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:14,595
Pellit? Trust me, Pellit's name means nothing anymore.

1627
01:26:14,753 --> 01:26:17,222
There it is. Thank you. Let's do it, guys.

1628
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:19,850
- Yeah, that's right. - Hang on. Where the fuck is Kurt?

1629
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:21,601
I killed Pellit.

1630
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,603
Hold that thought, I'm missing my friend Kurt.

1631
01:26:23,762 --> 01:26:28,359
I walked right up to his door, I put a gun in his chest and I shot him.

1632
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:31,771
Then you know what? You know what I did after that? I shot him again.

1633
01:26:31,937 --> 01:26:33,905
And let me tell you something.

1634
01:26:34,523 --> 01:26:36,400
I liked it.

1635
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:41,121
So if you think that I'm some sort of pussy...

1636
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:45,876
who won't do exactly the same thing to a couple of lame-assed blackmailers...

1637
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,160
think again.

1638
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:50,456
Know who thinks you're a pussy? My friend Kurt. Let me grab him.

1639
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:52,044
You are pathetic, Hendricks.

1640
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:59,431
You walk into my house on my goddamn birthday and pull this shit.

1641
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:02,642
Well, let me tell you something.

1642
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:05,895
You're dead.

1643
01:27:06,513 --> 01:27:09,016
You and you.

1644
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:10,525
- And...'? - Kurt.

1645
01:27:10,684 --> 01:27:13,312
Kurt. Dead men.

1646
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:16,656
- I didn't know it was your birthday. - What's he doing?

1647
01:27:16,815 --> 01:27:19,489
- What do you got? - Getting my gun. Only take a second.

1648
01:27:19,651 --> 01:27:20,948
- I'll get the car. - I'll go.

1649
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:25,161
We had him, we had the whole goddamn thing. What the fuck happened to Kurt?

1650
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:26,579
- Hey! - There you are.

1651
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:27,789
Where were you?

1652
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:30,329
My, uh, stomach was bothering me. Had to use the bathroom.

1653
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:32,793
He confessed everything, now he's getting his gun.

1654
01:27:32,956 --> 01:27:34,424
- Kurt, what happened there? - Oh, uh...

1655
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:36,585
she was giving me a tour of the mouth... House.

1656
01:27:37,002 --> 01:27:39,846
- Ow! What are you... '? - Get in the car. Right now.

1657
01:27:40,005 --> 01:27:42,133
- Knock it off. - Come on.

1658
01:27:45,886 --> 01:27:48,514
Look, I wasn't thinking, okay? I'm sorry.

1659
01:27:49,055 --> 01:27:52,309
She-'s just very hot. And I'm weak. I'm a weak, weak man, okay?

1660
01:27:52,476 --> 01:27:53,602
I admit it.

1661
01:27:54,978 --> 01:27:56,946
- Back it up, back it up. - Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1662
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:58,607
- They found my DNA. - Back it up.

1663
01:27:58,774 --> 01:28:03,200
Go backwards. Go backwards. See? They found your poop brush.

1664
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:05,491
You are obsessed with your asshole!

1665
01:28:05,491 --> 01:28:07,204
No, I'm not. It was a prank, Dale.

1666
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:10,244
Shut it down. Let's start talking about where we're gonna live.

1667
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:13,380
- The current situation Won't work. - There'll be cops everywhere.

1668
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:14,835
You talking about fleeing?

1669
01:28:14,998 --> 01:28:17,547
Damn right. I'm talking about Canada or Mexico.

1670
01:28:17,876 --> 01:28:20,595
I can't live in Mexico. I mean, I can't handle the food.

1671
01:28:20,754 --> 01:28:22,677
My digestion alone... I'll probably die.

1672
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:25,433
- You'd rather be in jail the rest of your life? - Shut the fuck up.

1673
01:28:26,802 --> 01:28:28,930
I'm getting a call. I gotta get this. Hello?

1674
01:28:29,387 --> 01:28:30,559
Hello, lover.

1675
01:28:30,722 --> 01:28:33,475
Uh, look, Julia, now's not a good time to talk.

1676
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:35,736
- Hey, I'm not here. - That's okay.

1677
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:38,113
I actually meant to call your home phone.

1678
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:40,069
You know, tell Stacy about us.

1679
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:43,406
- No, don't do that. Wait. Wait. - We'll learn the metric system.

1680
01:28:43,568 --> 01:28:46,742
We gotta buy coats and sweaters and learn hockey and all that shit.

1681
01:28:46,905 --> 01:28:49,158
No, I think I've waited long enough, Dale.

1682
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,668
I'm sort of tired of you toying with my emotions.

1683
01:28:51,827 --> 01:28:53,249
I'm not playing with you.

1684
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:57,041
I'm not toying with you. I'm gonna take care of it. I'm gonna take care of it.

1685
01:28:57,207 --> 01:29:00,086
Wait, wait, wait. What are you gonna do to me?

1686
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:02,091
- I'm gonna have sex with you. - What?

1687
01:29:02,254 --> 01:29:04,382
I want you to give me details, you pussy.

1688
01:29:04,548 --> 01:29:06,221
And please be explicit.

1689
01:29:06,383 --> 01:29:08,010
Details? I'm in a car with people. 

1690
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:09,637
Now is not a good time for details.

1691
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:13,231
- I don't care if it's not a great time. - Okay, fine.

1692
01:29:13,390 --> 01:29:15,438
I'm gonna make you feel good. You know?

1693
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,069
With my fingers and my tongue and whatnot.

1694
01:29:18,228 --> 01:29:20,105
I know you can do better than that.

1695
01:29:20,272 --> 01:29:22,946
All right, I'm gonna put my penis in your pussy, Julia.

1696
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:25,406
Oh, boy, that's gonna get me done.

1697
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:28,701
What the fuck was that?

1698
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:33,748
- What the fuck? - That's Harken. Lose him.

1699
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:36,955
- Oh, my God! - Get out of here.

1700
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:40,925
Look, careful.

1701
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:46,765
Hey, are you gonna slap me in the face with your cock, Dale?

1702
01:29:46,923 --> 01:29:49,221
Yes, I'll slap you in the face with my cock!

1703
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:52,638
- This guy's fucking crazy. - Slap you all over your face with my cock!

1704
01:29:53,138 --> 01:29:55,140
- Don't get in a wreck. - It's go time.

1705
01:29:57,309 --> 01:29:58,982
Okay. More, Dale.

1706
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:00,646
I will go up and down on you...

1707
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:03,736
and I'll rub my naked butt against your naked butt...

1708
01:30:03,899 --> 01:30:05,492
until it's raw and red...

1709
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:07,698
and we're both really chafed up real bad.

1710
01:30:14,284 --> 01:30:17,163
Not good. Get us out of here! Get us out of here!

1711
01:30:17,329 --> 01:30:18,330
I got it, I got it.

1712
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:22,426
- Come on. - I'll spit on your arms and stuff.

1713
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:24,336
- What else? - And then I'm gonna...

1714
01:30:24,502 --> 01:30:26,379
jam my skull into the crack of your ass!

1715
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:30,675
Yeah, baby. In the crack of your ass.

1716
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:34,187
And I'll dance on your boobies, and I'll jump up and down on your butt.

1717
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:39,939
Ah. I'll see you Friday, dirty bird.

1718
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:41,444
Good. Friday. See you Friday.

1719
01:30:41,603 --> 01:30:43,605
Nice job fucking the crazy out of her, Kurt!

1720
01:30:43,772 --> 01:30:46,116
Maybe I should have been dancing on her boobs, huh?

1721
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:47,366
Maybe you should have.

1722
01:30:47,525 --> 01:30:49,243
That was very good driving, by the way.

1723
01:30:49,402 --> 01:30:50,494
Thank you very much.

1724
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:53,578
- Good evening, Mn Buckman. - Yeah, hey, Gregory. How are you?

1725
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:56,209
Our onboard sensors report you've had a collision.

1726
01:30:56,368 --> 01:30:58,496
That's because we have a crazy man that hit us.

1727
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:01,541
I will alert the authorities and direct them to your location.

1728
01:31:01,706 --> 01:31:03,800
Don't call the cops. They're already after us.

1729
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:07,964
No, Gregory, they think we murdered someone, all right? Do not call the cops.

1730
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:11,599
What's going on? Why you slowing down, Kurt?

1731
01:31:11,758 --> 01:31:14,728
Whoa. Oh, no, no, no. I didn't do that. No, the engine died.

1732
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:17,230
- I remotely disabled your engine. - What?

1733
01:31:17,389 --> 01:31:19,141
It is standard Nav Guide protocol...

1734
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:21,230
whenever a driver has committed a crime.

1735
01:31:21,393 --> 01:31:23,987
I pay 19 bucks a month for this fucking service.

1736
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:27,066
- Remain with your vehicle. - The police will be arriving shortly.

1737
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:30,031
Gregory, I thought you were our fucking friend, man!

1738
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:47,927
Get out of the car, all of you. Come on. Come on.

1739
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:53,934
- Remember I saved your life that one time? - Shut up.

1740
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:58,138
- Just take it easy with that... - Shut up.

1741
01:31:58,304 --> 01:31:59,977
I got six bullets in this gun.

1742
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:03,610
Which means I can shoot all of you twice, just like that bastard Pellit...

1743
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:05,770
if I really wanted to, but I'm not gonna.

1744
01:32:05,937 --> 01:32:08,440
You're not gonna shoot us twice or not gonna shoot us?

1745
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:09,778
Shut up.

1746
01:32:10,817 --> 01:32:14,663
I got a better idea. I'm gonna tell the cops that you killed Pellit.

1747
01:32:14,821 --> 01:32:18,451
And when I found out, you tried to kill me to shut me up.

1748
01:32:18,616 --> 01:32:20,118
- That's crazy. - Is it?

1749
01:32:20,285 --> 01:32:24,131
Because I don't see one shred of evidence that proves that I shot Pellit.

1750
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:26,792
And besides, I'm the guy with the bullet in his leg.

1751
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:28,255
What?

1752
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:32,263
God, that hurts so much.

1753
01:32:32,422 --> 01:32:34,174
Son of a bitch.

1754
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:35,762
- Catch! - No, don't ca...!

1755
01:32:35,925 --> 01:32:37,802
- Goddamn it, Dale. - You see?

1756
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:41,473
You can't win a marathon without putting some Band-Aids on your nipples.

1757
01:32:42,182 --> 01:32:44,776
- What does that mean? - Watch this.

1758
01:32:50,607 --> 01:32:51,859
- Everybody freeze! - Police!

1759
01:32:52,025 --> 01:32:54,244
Drop the gun! On your knees!

1760
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:57,326
- Thank God. - Officers, thank God you're here.

1761
01:32:57,489 --> 01:32:59,491
These guys, they shot me.

1762
01:32:59,657 --> 01:33:01,330
- That's not true! - That's bullshit!

1763
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:04,292
I found out they murdered someone. They tried to shut me up.

1764
01:33:04,454 --> 01:33:07,333
Please protect me from them. I have a wife and a cat!

1765
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:09,877
- All right, take it easy. - Call for an ambulance.

1766
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:13,931
- Hey, what is this? - It's nothing. It's just a tape recorder.

1767
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:15,636
Oh, shit! It's a tape recorder!

1768
01:33:15,799 --> 01:33:18,848
- A tape recorder. Did you turn that off? - No, it's been recording!

1769
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:21,388
- So listen to us, officer. - Hands up!

1770
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:24,603
Listen to us for one second. He confessed to killing Pellit.

1771
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:26,063
He said he shot him twice...

1772
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:29,480
and he was gonna shoot us once or twice. He was unclear about that.

1773
01:33:29,646 --> 01:33:31,865
- You are insane. - Just play the tape.

1774
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:37,158
But all those people are just right outside.

1775
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:39,038
Your balls are so smooth.

1776
01:33:39,405 --> 01:33:40,952
Wait a minute. Is that my wife?

1777
01:33:41,116 --> 01:33:43,039
No, no. Of course not, no. Let's move past that.

1778
01:33:43,201 --> 01:33:45,875
- -Jam my skull into the crack of your ass!

1779
01:33:46,037 --> 01:33:48,460
I'll dance on your boobies, and jump up and down on your butt.

1780
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:49,670
What the fuck is this?

1781
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:53,178
Don't judge. I have a thing with my boss- It's none of your business.

1782
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:54,838
If you could get to the end...'?

1783
01:33:58,550 --> 01:33:59,676
There's nothing on here.

1784
01:33:59,843 --> 01:34:01,220
- Shit! - What happened?

1785
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:03,229
Thing must have stopped when we crashed.

1786
01:34:03,388 --> 01:34:05,061
Before this guy supposedly confessed?

1787
01:34:05,223 --> 01:34:07,726
I told you, these guys are liars. They cannot be trusted.

1788
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:09,735
They shot me in the leg, killed a guy.

1789
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:12,397
- He shot himself. - I don't need to hear anything else.

1790
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:16,409
- Cuff them. - Oh, my God.

1791
01:34:16,568 --> 01:34:19,321
- You don't need to cuff us. - My God, we're going to jail.

1792
01:34:19,487 --> 01:34:21,114
We're going to jail. Unbelievable.

1793
01:34:21,281 --> 01:34:22,703
It hurts. It hurts so much.

1794
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:24,664
Excuse me? Officers?

1795
01:34:24,868 --> 01:34:26,996
I should mention that it is Nav Guide policy...

1796
01:34:27,162 --> 01:34:30,006
to record all conversations for quality assurance.

1797
01:34:30,165 --> 01:34:32,463
- Who the hell's that? - That's our Nav Guide rep.

1798
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:34,218
- His name is Almonan. - Hands up!

1799
01:34:34,377 --> 01:34:35,924
- Atmanad. - Almondmond.

1800
01:34:36,087 --> 01:34:38,431
- Atmanad is what it was! - Atmanand.

1801
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:41,434
Atmand... Gregory, uh, play what he said.

1802
01:34:41,593 --> 01:34:44,221
- Play it just after the crash. - Very good, sir.

1803
01:34:44,387 --> 01:34:47,106
You're not gonna listen to this. This isn't evidence.

1804
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:49,313
I got six bullets in this gun.

1805
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:52,445
Which means I can shoot all of you twice, just like that bastard Pellit...

1806
01:34:52,604 --> 01:34:55,073
if I really wanted to, but I'm not gonna.

1807
01:34:55,231 --> 01:34:56,699
- That's it. - So it was you.

1808
01:34:59,235 --> 01:35:02,614
That is not proof. That's just a car. You're not gonna listen to a car.

1809
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:05,374
Looks like I'm getting that promotion after all. Yeah.

1810
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:07,785
To answer your question, that was your wife.

1811
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:10,080
- You fucked my wife? - I fucked your wife.

1812
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:11,293
Nobody fucks my wife!

1813
01:35:16,836 --> 01:35:18,304
How you like them nipples?

1814
01:35:18,463 --> 01:35:20,090
Did you just do the catchphrase?

1815
01:35:20,256 --> 01:35:22,475
- Good Will Hunting. - Good Will Hunting.

1816
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:24,261
- That's so great. - Caught it, yeah.

1817
01:35:24,427 --> 01:35:27,556
Good Will Hunting rip. Instead of saying "apples" he said nipples."

1818
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:29,816
- Felt like a moment. - And happy birthday.

1819
01:35:29,974 --> 01:35:32,352
So in the end, we didn't wind up going to jail.

1820
01:35:32,518 --> 01:35:35,146
Actually, we did later that night when they booked us.

1821
01:35:35,313 --> 01:35:37,315
But since we led the cops to Harken...

1822
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:40,361
they ultimately agreed to let our other offenses slide.

1823
01:35:40,526 --> 01:35:42,028
Strangely enough, lucky for Kurt...

1824
01:35:42,654 --> 01:35:46,329
there 's no laws on the books against putting people's toiletries up your ass.

1825
01:35:46,491 --> 01:35:48,619
Anyway, with Harken in his new position...

1826
01:35:48,785 --> 01:35:54,042
on all fours in prison for 25 to life, Comnidyne made me acting president.

1827
01:35:54,749 --> 01:35:58,424
It's a great job, I got a solid raise and I 'm actually my own boss.

1828
01:35:58,586 --> 01:35:59,883
Well, except for the CEO.

1829
01:36:00,046 --> 01:36:03,767
- Morning. - Oh, morning. You, uh, must be Nick.

1830
01:36:03,925 --> 01:36:06,678
- I am. - Well, it's great to finally meet you.

1831
01:36:06,844 --> 01:36:09,848
- You too, Mr. Sherman. - Please. Lou.

1832
01:36:10,515 --> 01:36:12,438
Okay. Lou.

1833
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,695
I appreciate the opportunity you've given me. I won't let you down.

1834
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:17,522
Yeah, I'm sure you won't, son.

1835
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:20,363
From what I hear people say he's the nicest guy in the world.

1836
01:36:21,734 --> 01:36:23,657
Mr. Sherman, I'm sorry your coffee was cold.

1837
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:24,867
Uh, Lou?

1838
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:26,246
Most people.

1839
01:36:26,406 --> 01:36:29,376
Mr. Sherman, I'm hungry!

1840
01:36:29,534 --> 01:36:31,502
Can I come out now, please?

1841
01:36:31,661 --> 01:36:34,039
- You hear that? - No.

1842
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:36,299
Sounds like there's someone in your trunk.

1843
01:36:36,499 --> 01:36:40,879
Why don't we let this be, uh, our little secret?

1844
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:42,422
I need a shower.

1845
01:36:42,588 --> 01:36:44,886
Yeah. Turns out my new boss...

1846
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:47,222
is a twisted old fuck.

1847
01:36:48,553 --> 01:36:52,399
Meanwhile, the Pellit family put the most senior person in charge of the company...

1848
01:36:52,557 --> 01:36:55,561
which wasn't Kurt. But he was okay with that.

1849
01:36:55,727 --> 01:36:59,652
Because he realized that when you're the boss, sometimes people want you dead.

1850
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:03,193
- Hey, Kurt. Come in. - Margie, I wanted to congratulate you.

1851
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:04,406
Thank you.

1852
01:37:04,569 --> 01:37:08,324
If there's anything I can do to help out before the baby gets here, let me know.

1853
01:37:08,489 --> 01:37:10,662
- What baby? - Your baby.

1854
01:37:11,743 --> 01:37:14,747
- I'm not pregnant. - So I'm just touching you?

1855
01:37:17,749 --> 01:37:19,296
Julia.

1856
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:24,260
I was thinking perhaps we could drill the patient first.

1857
01:37:24,422 --> 01:37:25,469
And Dale?

1858
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:29,435
Ultimately, he decided his only choice was to screw Julia after all.

1859
01:37:29,594 --> 01:37:33,599
You just continue to surprise me...

1860
01:37:33,765 --> 01:37:35,938
you dirty, dirty little man.

1861
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:38,274
Just you wait.

1862
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:41,530
You like that, Dale?

1863
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:43,282
- You like that, Dale? - Oh, my God, yeah.

1864
01:37:46,486 --> 01:37:50,457
Oh, gosh, do I wish I could have sex with Julia.

1865
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:54,536
What?

1866
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:57,455
I'm so sorry, but I couldn't keep it together! It's amazing!

1867
01:37:57,622 --> 01:37:59,795
- She was talking to your penis! - Who are you?

1868
01:37:59,957 --> 01:38:03,712
Julia, this is my good friend, Kenny Sommerfeld.

1869
01:38:03,878 --> 01:38:05,551
Most Likely to Succeed.

1870
01:38:05,713 --> 01:38:07,807
- Give me some of that. - Don't you touch me.

1871
01:38:07,965 --> 01:38:10,639
Now, Kenny here, he'll do just about anything for 50 bucks.

1872
01:38:10,802 --> 01:38:12,896
- Yeah, it's true. - Yeah, and it's not pretty.

1873
01:38:13,054 --> 01:38:15,807
But that's why I asked him to help me frame you.

1874
01:38:15,973 --> 01:38:20,103
Really? Is this all you've got? Your word against mine?

1875
01:38:20,269 --> 01:38:21,816
Don't forget about that guy.

1876
01:38:21,979 --> 01:38:25,574
Say hi to my cameraman. He's filmed a lot of Hollywood hits.

1877
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:27,485
You are a sick little bastard.

1878
01:38:27,652 --> 01:38:29,450
You are a sick little bastard.

1879
01:38:29,612 --> 01:38:31,034
Shut the fuck up for a second.

1880
01:38:31,197 --> 01:38:34,167
Julia, shut the fuck up for a second, all right?

1881
01:38:34,325 --> 01:38:36,293
Now, here's what's gonna happen, okay?

1882
01:38:36,452 --> 01:38:41,716
I'm going to take a very nice, very expensive two-week vacation with my fiancee.

1883
01:38:41,874 --> 01:38:45,003
Let's call it a honeymoon, all right? And you are gonna pay for it.

1884
01:38:45,211 --> 01:38:50,263
Then I'm going to return to a rape-free workplace, all right?

1885
01:38:50,425 --> 01:38:55,352
Because if you so much as look at my sexy little ass, Julia...

1886
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:58,266
I will have yours locked the fuck up...

1887
01:38:58,433 --> 01:39:04,361
you crazy bitch whore!

1888
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:07,692
Ah, that felt good.

1889
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:19,546
How's the hair? Is it good, is it great? It's not as bad as his, is it?

1890
01:39:21,205 --> 01:39:27,178
I had no idea that you called your grandmother "Gam Gam."

1891
01:39:29,714 --> 01:39:31,261
Calm down!

1892
01:39:32,717 --> 01:39:33,843
Oh!

1893
01:39:37,013 --> 01:39:40,233
Holy shit. He went out the door.

1894
01:39:40,558 --> 01:39:43,732
This place is awful. It's like The Sharper Image took a shit in here...

1895
01:39:43,895 --> 01:39:45,112
Five forty with the briefcase.

1896
01:39:45,271 --> 01:39:47,899
Oh, shut up about the briefcase.

1897
01:39:48,065 --> 01:39:51,865
Gonna put that "briefcase" up my ass.

1898
01:39:53,237 --> 01:39:55,080
'M gonna put that briefcase up my ass!

1899
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:03,581
A dancin' girl

1900
01:40:03,748 --> 01:40:05,716
- You're good? He's good. - Yeah, I'm okay.

1901
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:08,586
Or else little Stacy here's gonna get a little peek...

1902
01:40:08,753 --> 01:40:12,178
...at my photo album.

1903
01:40:14,926 --> 01:40:17,554
One more. Let's fix this.

1904
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:22,104
Have you ever in your life seen this much co...?

1905
01:40:24,852 --> 01:40:27,605
Pee, pee, pee, pee on the...

1906
01:40:29,106 --> 01:40:30,278
Let's...

1907
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:37,414
Now I'm sneezing dust bunnies. Is that diabetes?

1908
01:40:37,573 --> 01:40:39,575
I'm a pharmacist, not a doctor.

1909
01:40:39,742 --> 01:40:41,460
Is that my brain? Take my temperature.

1910
01:40:41,619 --> 01:40:43,087
Have you any, uh, roofies?

1911
01:40:43,246 --> 01:40:45,089
I want a lollipop. Do you like karaoke?

1912
01:40:45,248 --> 01:40:48,001
Do you have MDMA? I'll suck your d...

1913
01:40:53,297 --> 01:40:55,140
Shit happens.

1914
01:40:56,801 --> 01:41:01,682
What is your projected outside date of completion, Motherfucker?

1915
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:12,233
Give me that again.

1916
01:41:14,819 --> 01:41:17,117
- Oh, hi! Hi! Hello. - Hi.

1917
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:18,497
Come on, what are you...?

1918
01:41:20,324 --> 01:41:23,544
Wouldn't mind bending her over a barrel and showing her the 50 states.

1919
01:41:23,703 --> 01:41:25,125
I don't know what that means.

1920
01:41:25,288 --> 01:41:27,256
- It's a phrase. - I don't think so.

1921
01:41:27,415 --> 01:41:31,261
Yeah, it is. It certainly is. Yeah, it definitely is.

1922
01:41:31,419 --> 01:41:33,672
- Really? - Yeah, it's from a movie.

1923
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:36,720
It is now.

1924
01:41:37,008 --> 01:41:38,726
Beautiful.
