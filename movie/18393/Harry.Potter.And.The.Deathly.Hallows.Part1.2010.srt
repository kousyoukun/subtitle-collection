

2
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,240
这是个黑暗的时候 这是不可否认的
These are dark times, there is no denying.

3
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:47,490
我们的世界不会面临 比今天更大的威胁
Our world has, perhaps, faced no greater threat than it does today.

4
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,420
不过我会对我们公民说。
But I say this to our citizenry:

5
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,500
我们是你们每一个人的公仆  ...
We, ever your servants...

6
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,330
... 将继续捍卫你们的自由 
...will continue to defend your liberty...

7
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,840
并且设法排除这股力量。
and repel the forces that seek to take it from you.

8
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:10,310
你们的魔法部仍然是
Your Ministry remains...

9
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,820
很强大的。
strong.

10
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,600
 黑暗标记引发恐慌

11
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,630
 暴力蔓延 麻瓜家庭遇害

12
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,660
食死徒数目增加

13
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,370
茶好了, 亲爱的 
Hermione. Tea's ready, darling.

14
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,470
来了, 妈妈!
Coming, Mom.

15
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,310
快点 达力 赶快
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

16
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,510
我不明白干嘛非得离开这里?。
I still don't understand why we have to leave.

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,450
因为继续住在这里很不安全
Because, unh, it's not safe for us here anymore.

18
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,210
荣恩 ，跟你爹说晚餐快准备好了
Ron, tell your father supper's nearly ready.

19
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,940
这是在澳大利亚？
Is this in Australia?

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,080
绵延3500公里的澳大利亚东海岸
Looks wonderful, doesn't it?

21
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,120
很美，不是吗？
Three and a half thousand kilometers along Australia's east coast.

22
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,950
 一忘皆空。
Obliviate.



24
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,950
赛佛勒斯,
Severus.

25
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,490
 我还担心你是不是迷路了...
I was beginning to worry you had lost your way.

26
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,120
来吧, 我们给你留了座位
Come, we've saved you a seat.

27
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,900
You bring news, I trust?
我猜你肯定带来了什么消息吧

28
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,740
时间订在下周六晚上
It will happen Saturday next, at nightfall.

29
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,280
我听到的不一样 我的主人
I've heard differently, my Lord.

30
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,570
多利士 傲罗说漏了嘴，
Dawlish, the Auror, has let slip that the Potter boy...

31
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,840
波特本月30日前不会离开。
will not be moved until the 30th of this month.

32
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,550
要等到他过完17岁生日
The day before he turns 17.

33
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,950
这是误导
This is a false trail.

34
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,790
傲罗办事处不再参与保护哈利波特的行动。
The Auror Office no longer plays any part in the protection of Harry Potter.

35
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,330
哈利身边的人确信 我们的人混入魔法部。
Those closest to him believe we have infiltrated the Ministry.

36
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,530
好啊!还真让他们给说中了,
Well, they got that right, haven't they?

37
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,480
你怎么说, 皮乌斯?
What say you, Pius?

38
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,610
消息倒是不少 主人。
One hears many things, my Lord.

39
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,340
可是哪条是真的还不明朗。
Whether the truth is among them is not clear.

40
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,890
你讲话还真像个政客。
Heh. Spoken like a true politician.

41
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,120
我认为你会发挥极大用处的, 皮乌斯。
You will, I think, prove most useful, Pius.

42
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,960
- 他们要把那小子带到哪里? - 安全的地方。
- Where will he be taken, the boy? - To a safe house.

43
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,990
可能是某位凤凰会成员家里。
Most likely the home of someone in the Order.

44
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,400
听说已采取最全面的防护措施
I'm told it's been given every manner of protection possible.

45
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,170
一旦他到达那里 将很难攻击他了
Once there, it will be impractical to attack him.

46
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:08,280
我的主人, 我自愿执行这个任务。
Ahem. My Lord. I'd like to volunteer myself for this task.

47
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,440
我想杀了那小子
I want to kill the boy.

48
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,010
虫尾巴
Wormtail!

49
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,150
我没跟你说要让客人保持安静吗 ?
Have I not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet?

50
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,220
遵命, 我的主人。
Yes, my Lord.

51
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,050
好的我马上去, 主人。
Right away, my Lord.

52
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,790
你杀气很重表现让人兴奋 贝拉特里克斯
As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix...

53
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,530
但我必须亲手杀死哈利 波特。
...I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.

54
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,810
不过 我遇到一个棘手的难题。
But I face an unfortunate complication.

55
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:41,170
我的魔杖跟波特的杖芯是相同的。
That my wand and Potter's share the same core.

56
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:48,980
他们, 从某程度来讲, 是一对的。
They are, in some ways, twins.

57
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,850
我们 能伤害彼此 但无法杀死对方。
We can wound, but not fatally harm one another.

58
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,260
假如我要杀死他 ...
If I am to kill him...

59
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,700
必须使用其他魔杖
I must do it with another's wand.

60
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:10,400
那好, 你们有谁想要这份荣耀
Come, surely one of you would like the honor?

61
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,670
嗯？
Mm?

62
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,180
你怎样啊, 卢修斯?
What about you, Lucius?

63
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,090
我的主人 
My Lord?

64
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,230
我的主人？
"My Lord?"

65
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,920
我需要你的魔杖
I require your wand.

66
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,710
我看看是不是榆木的? 
Do I detect elm?

67
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,850
- 是的, 主人。
Yes, my Lord.

68
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,720
杖芯呢?
And the core?

69
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,090
是龙的...嗯 
Dragon. Ahem.

70
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,890
是龙的神经 主人
Dragon heartstring, my Lord.

71
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,260
Dragon heartstring. - Mm.
龙的神经？ - 嗯

72
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,740
你们可能有人不认识 ...
To those of you who do not know...

73
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,580
我们今晚邀请的客人凯瑞迪 布巴吉
we are joined tonight by Miss Charity Burbage...

74
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:30,250
以前在霍格华兹魔法学校，她是个的老师 
who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

75
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,880
她的专业是研究麻瓜
Her specialty was Muggle Studies.

76
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:43,370
巴布吉小姐认为 麻瓜与我们没什么不同
It is Miss Burbage's belief that Muggles are not so different from us.

77
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:47,170
她要用她的方式 ...
She would, given her way...

78
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,870
让我们跟麻瓜通婚。
have us mate with them.

79
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:59,750
对她来说，巫师与麻瓜结婚非但不可恶
To her, the mixture of magical and Muggle blood is not an abomination...

80
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,950
通常还有些愉悦。
but something to be encouraged.

81
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,890
赛佛勒斯
Severus.

82
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,030
赛佛勒斯。求求你
Severus.Plz...

83
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,860
我们是朋友
We're friends.

84
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,190
阿瓦达索命！！！
Avada Kedavra!

85
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,470
纳吉尼
Nagini

86
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,750
吃饭了。
Dinner.

87
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,460
嘿，哈利u - 哇喔，太好了u
Hello, Harry. - All right. Wow.

88
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,720
嗨! 
Hello.

89
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,800
- 你看起来好极了。- 是啊, 他当然好了
- You're looking fit. - Yeah, he's absolutely gorgeous.

90
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,440
我们要赶在他们动手前悄悄行动
What say we get undercover before someone murders him

91
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,940
金斯莱，我以为你保护首相了
I thought you were looking after the Prime Minister.

92
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,010
你更重要
You are more important.

93
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,240
- 你好 哈利。 比尔 韦斯利。 - 很高兴认识你。
- Hello, Harry. Bill Weasley. - Oh. Pleasure to meet you.

94
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,410
- 他并不常这么帅气 - 丑死了。 
- He was never always this handsome. - Dead ugly.

95
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,990
真的够了
True enough.

96
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,680
一个名叫格里贝克的狼人造成的 
Owe it all to a werewolf, name of Greyback.

97
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,230
- 我想有一天会还给他的 - 在我眼里你还是那么帅, 比尔。
- Hope to repay the favor one day. - You're still beautiful to me, William.

98
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,230
你要小心,弗勒尔，比尔现在喜欢上生牛排了
Just remember, Fleur, Bill takes his steaks on the raw side now.

99
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,730
我先生就喜欢开玩笑。
My husband, the joker.

100
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,170
现在有件事, 还没来的及说.我和Remus...
By the way, wait till you hear the news. Remus and I--

101
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,770
好了，没时间让你们闲话家常了 
All right. We'll have time for a cozy catch-up later.

102
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,910
我们得尽快离开这个鬼地方
We've got to get the hell out of here. And soon.

103
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,840
波特, 你还没成年,身上还留有踪丝。
Potter, you're underage, which means you've still got the Trace on you.

104
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,040
什么踪丝?
What's the Trace?

105
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,880
假如你打喷嚏, 魔法部都知道谁擦了你的鼻子。
If you sneeze, the Ministry will know who wipes your nose.

106
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,220
我们只能用追踪不到的运输工具
We have to use those means of transport the Trace can't detect:

107
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,720
用扫帚、夜骐飞行 成双结队走。
Brooms, Thestrals and the like. We go in pairs.

108
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:29,660
这样的话，就算有人埋伏在那等着我们，
That way, if anyone's out there waiting for us, and I reckon there will be...

109
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,320
我估计他们也搞不清楚哪一个是真正的哈利波特。
they won't know which Harry Potter is the real one.

110
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,930
真的哈利波特?
The real one?

111
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,360
我相信你对复方汤剂一定不陌生
I believe you're familiar with this particular brew.

112
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,840
- 不,绝对不行 。 
No. Absolutely not.

113
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,340
- 我告诉过你他一定不答应的。
I told you he'd take it well.

114
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,640
不, 为了我怎能让每一个人去冒险 ...
No, if you think I'm gonna let everyone risk their lives for me, I--

115
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:48,870
- 我们以前没做过。 - 不, 不, 这不一样。
- Never done that before, have we? - No. No. This is different.

116
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,040
喝下就会变成我。 不行!
I mean, taking that, becoming me. No.

117
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,050
我们也不想配合做
Well, none of us really fancy it, mate.

118
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,380
对啊, 万一有什么出错, 我们就得永远变成小笨蛋
Imagine if something went wrong, and we ended up a scrawny, specky git forever.

119
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,220
每个人都已成年, 波特。
Everyone here is of age, Potter.

120
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,360
他们都同意冒这个险。
They've all agreed to take the risk.

121
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,630
严格来讲 我是被迫的
Technically, I've been coerced.

122
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,990
波特先生，我是蒙顿格斯.佛莱奇 
Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter.

123
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,730
我一直以来都很崇拜你。- 闭嘴, 蒙顿格斯
Always been a huge admirer. - Nip it, Mundungus.

124
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,530
好了 格兰杰 依计行事
All right, Granger, as discussed.

125
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,440
- 赫敏 - 请放在这里
- Blimey, Hermione. - Straight in here, if you please.

126
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,480
以前没喝过复方汤剂请注意。
For those of you who haven't taken Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning:

127
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,280
它尝起来像妖精的尿
It tastes like goblin piss.

128
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,430
Have a lot of experiences with that, do you, Mad-Eye?
你一定有喝很多的经验吧 疯眼汉?

129
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,270
试着忘记汤剂的味道
Just trying to diffuse the tension.

130
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,100
啊噢~
Oh.

131
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,940
哎呀~
Ugh.

132
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,260
哇喔! 我们都一模一样了!
Wow, we're identical.

133
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,490
还没完全。
Not yet, you're not.

134
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,730
你就没有一件较运动型的? 
Haven't got anything a bit more sporting, have you?

135
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,370
这颜色没有我喜欢的。
I don't really fancy this color.

136
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,340
好了不管你喜不喜欢 , 你已经不是你了 快换上
Well, fancy this, you're not you. So shut it and strip.

137
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,070
好啦, 好啦
All right, all right.

138
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,810
你也要换, 波特。
You'll need to change too, Potter.

139
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,940
比尔, 别看, 我这样很丑
Bill, look away. I'm hideous.

140
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,420
说你有纹身，是她编出来的
I knew she was lying about that tattoo.

141
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,020
哈利, 你的视力真差。
Harry, your eyesight really is awful.

142
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,890
Right, then. We'll be pairing off. Each Potter will have a protector.
好了,我们成对离开。 每一位波特都有保护者。

143
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,360
Mundungus, stick tight to me. I wanna keep an eye on you.
蒙顿格斯, 你跟着我。 我要看好你

144
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,730
- 至于哈利 ... - 是的?
- As for Harry-- - Yes?

145
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,970
真正的哈利
The real Harry.

146
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,500
你到底在哪里?  这里！
- Where the devil are you, anyway? - Here.

147
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,640
你跟着海格骑摩托。
You'll ride with Hagrid.

148
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:59,840
十六年前我送你过来时, 你不到一个轮子大小。
I brought you here 16 years ago when you were no bigger than a Bowtruckle.

149
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,910
似乎注定我也该带你离开。
Seems only right that I should be the one to take you away now.

150
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,020
是的，实在感人啊。 出发吧!
Yes, it's all very touching. Let's go.

151
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:23,230
朝陋居去。 我们讲在那会合。
Head for the Burrows. We'll rendezvous there.

152
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,830
- 我数到三! 
On the count of three.

153
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,730
- 坐好了, 哈利!
Hold tight, Harry.

154
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,700
1
One...

155
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,370
2u
two...

156
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,580
3u
three!

157
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,750
- 哪一个？ - 你在哪？
- Which one? - Where are you?

158
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,680
在你右手边
He's on your right!

159
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,480
他在那!
He's over there!

160
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,320
趴下！！
Down!

161
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,460
海格, 我们必须帮助其他人! 
Hagrid, we have to help the others!

162
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,770
不能去, 哈利，疯眼汉有命令。
I can't do that, Harry. Mad-Eye's orders.

163
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,510
抓紧了!
Hang on.

164
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,370
昏昏倒地u
Stupefy!

165
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,190
抓紧了, 哈利!
Hang on, Harry.

166
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,970
海格u
Hagrid.

167
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,460
不u  不u
No. No.

168
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,540
哈利u
Harry.

169
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,560
哈利! 海格!
Harry. Hagrid.

170
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,430
发生什么事?其他人在哪里?
What happened? Where are the others?

171
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,770
其他人没回来吗?
Is no one else back?

172
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,500
他们从一开始就追杀我们，莫丽。我们总算死里逃生。
They were on us right from the start, Molly. We didn't stand a chance.

173
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,840
啊 ,你们没事就好
Well, thank goodness you two are all right.

174
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,580
食死徒 早就等在那攻击我们。
The Death Eaters were waiting for us. It was an ambush.

175
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,150
乔治和荣恩 应该也要回来了。
Ron and Tonks should've already been back.

176
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,520
还有爹与弗雷德。
Dad and Fred as well.

177
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,120
这里
Here!

178
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,200
快点。 进屋里去。
Quick. Into the house.

179
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,930
噢 我的孩子 ...
Oh, my boy.

180
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,600
哦，噢
Oh. Oh.

181
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,510
- Lupinu 卢平你在做什么！！！！！
- Lupin! - What are you doing?

182
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:05,980
在霍格华兹，哈利第一次来我的办公室时
What creature sat in the corner...

183
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,450
蹲在墙角的那是什么东西？
the first time Harry Potter visited my office in Hogwarts?

184
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,250
- 你疯了吗? - 什么生物?
- Are you mad? - What creature?!

185
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,250
那是只格林迪洛。
A Grindylow.

186
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,260
我们被出卖了
We've been betrayed.

187
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,830
伏地魔知道你今晚要离开。
Voldemort knew you were being moved tonight.

188
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,900
我要证明你不是假的。
I had to make sure you weren't an impostor.

189
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,480
等等u
Wait.

190
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,010
邓不利多对我们俩说的最后一句话是什么。
The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?

191
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:49,190
"哈利 是我们最宝贵的希望。相信他 "
"Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him."

192
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,820
谁帮你脱险的?
What gave you away?

193
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,200
海德薇 我想是她。她一直努力保护着我。
Hedwig, I think. She was trying to protect me.

194
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,910
谢谢。
Thanks.

195
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,250
值得抱一下。 他太了不起了。 
Deserves that. Brilliant, he was.

196
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,520
- 要是没有他就没有我了。- 真的吗？
- I wouldn't be standing here without him. - Really?

197
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,190
Always the tone of surprise.
为什么总是如此大惊小怪?

198
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,600
我们是最后回来的吗?。 
We the last back?

199
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:36,930
乔治在哪里?
Where's George?

200
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,460
你感觉怎样, 乔治
How you feeling, Georgie?

201
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,990
- 洞听啊。 
Saint-like.

202
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,430
- 什么?
Come again?

203
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,930
洞听啊。我多了个洞
Saint-like. I'm holy.

204
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,500
我多个洞 弗雷德 带着他吧?
I'm holey, Fred. Get it?

205
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,010
全世界那么多与耳朵有关的幽默，你就选择“洞听”！。
The whole wide world of ear-related humor and you go for "I'm holey."

206
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,350
真是个悲剧
That's pathetic.

207
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,250
我还是比你好看
Reckon I'm still better-looking than you.

208
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,990
疯眼汉已经死了。
Mad-Eye's dead.

209
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:45,100
蒙顿格斯看了伏地魔一眼 然后在朝陋居去的方向上
Mundungus took one look at Voldemort and Disapparated.

210
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,060
消失了
Head for the Burrows.

211
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,230
这超越每个人的想象。
This is beyond anything I imagined.

212
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,030
- 七个？ 七个魂器 ..
- Seven? - Seven...? A Horcrux.

213
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,640
- 他们可能隐藏在任何地方, 找不到它们。
They could be hidden anywhere.

214
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,000
将灵魂 分成七个部分 ...
To rip the soul into seven pieces....

215
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,150
- 假如我们把每一个魂器都摧毁 ... - 就能击败伏地魔了
- If you did destroy each Horcrux.... - One destroys Voldemort.

216
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,380
- 哈利 ... - 相信我。
Trust me.

217
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,880
你骗我。 奥利凡多，你说谎。
You lied to me. Lied to me, Ollivander.

218
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,760
你要去哪里?
Going somewhere?

219
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:13,520
大家不该去送死。为了我去死
Nobody else is going to die. Not for me.

220
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,500
为你?
For you?

221
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,900
你认为疯眼汉为你而死?
You think Mad-Eye died for you?

222
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,010
你认为乔治 为了你受伤?
You think George took that curse for you?

223
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:25,710
你可能是救世主 ...这才是最重要
You may be the Chosen One, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that.

224
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,400
比什么都重要。
It's always been bigger than that.

225
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,110
跟我来。 - 什么，留下赫敏吗?
Come with me. - What, and leave Hermione?

226
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:37,820
你疯了吗？没有她 我们活不过两天
You mad? We wouldn't last two days without her.

227
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,750
别告诉她这是我说的。
Don't tell her I said that.

228
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:45,520
除此之外你身上还有踪丝, 
Besides, you've still got the Trace on you.

229
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,790
- 我们还要参加婚礼 ... - 我不在乎一个婚礼。
- We've still got the wedding-- - I don't care about a wedding.

230
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:54,840
我很抱歉, 不管谁要结婚。 我必须开始寻找魂器。
I'm sorry. No matter whose it is. I have to start finding these Horcruxes.

231
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,980
那是我们唯一能够击败他的机会,。
They're our only chance to beat him...

232
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,110
我们停留在这里越久, 他就越强大。
and the longer we stay here, the stronger he gets.

233
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,640
但不是今晚这时候
Tonight's not the night, mate.

234
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,420
先放过他两天。
We'd only be doing him a favor.

235
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,110
你认为他知道吗？
Do you think he knows?

236
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:42,720
那些是魂器的部分灵魂 。是他的一部份
I mean, they're bits of his soul, these Horcruxes. Bits of him.

237
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,720
当邓不利多毁了那枚戒指，你毁了汤姆里德尔的日记的时候
When Dumbledore destroyed the ring, you destroyed Tom Riddle's diary...

238
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,820
伏地魔应该是感觉到什么了
he must have felt something.

239
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,330
毁掉其他魂器,就等于击败他
To kill the other Horcruxes, we have to find them.

240
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,670
其他魂器在哪？
Where are they?

241
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,260
我们从哪里开始找?
Where do we start?

242
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,800
在你做好准备的时候！
Ready when you are.

243
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:11,850
请注意！是你兄弟的婚礼，赶紧了
Please pay attention! It's your brother's wedding. Buck up.

244
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:23,170
 邓不利多的黑色秘密 丽塔 斯基特推出新书

245
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,030
 怀念邓不利多 埃菲亚斯多吉

246
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,330
帮我一下 ?
Zip me up, will you?

247
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,130
似乎很愚蠢 我是说婚礼
It seems silly, doesn't it, a wedding?

248
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,990
考虑很多要怎么去做的事
Given everything that's going on.

249
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,390
可能它是最好的理由
Maybe that's the best reason to have it...

250
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,530
because of everything that's going on.
因为一切还是要继续

251
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,750
早。
Morning.

252
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:35,090
来吧，快跟上
Come on, keep up.

253
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,430
各就各位!
All together now.

254
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,040
一u 二u 三u
One, two, three.

255
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,550
你们那边怎样了?
How's it looking at your end, boys?

256
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,120
很好
Brilliant.

257
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:05,060
噢, 天啊。 魔法部长怎么来了?
Bloody hell. What's the Minister of Magic doing here?

258
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,830
部长来此有何贵事?
To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister?

259
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,570
我想这问题你比我更明白, 波特先生。
I think we both know the answer to that question, Mr. Potter.

260
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,150
你这是
And this is...?

261
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:39,100
现在我来宣布 ...
"Herein is set forth the last will and testament...

262
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:43,860
...阿不思 珀西瓦尔 伍尔夫里克 布莱恩 邓不利多的遗嘱。
...of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.

263
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,500
首先，荣恩 比利斯 韦斯利 ...
First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley...

264
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:51,970
"... 我将自己设计制作的 ...
...I leave my Deluminator...

265
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,410
熄灯器留给他"
...a device of my own making...

266
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:59,810
"...我希望在最黑暗时候 "
...in the hope that, when things seem most dark...

267
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,320
"... 它能带给你光明。"
...it will show him the light."

268
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:13,320
- 邓不利多把这留给我? - 是的。
- Dumbledore left this for me? - Yeah.

269
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,860
太棒了。
Brilliant.

270
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,730
这要做什用的?
What is it?

271
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,470
太帅了。
Wicked.

272
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:37,760
" 给 赫敏 格兰杰 ..."
"To Hermione Jean Granger...

273
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:43,090
"... 我留下的诗翁彼豆故事集 ..."
...I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard...

274
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:47,930
"... 希望她能从书中得到乐趣与启发 "
...in the hope that she find it entertaining and instructive."

275
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,060
妈妈曾读过给我听。
Mom used to read me those.

276
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,460
精灵与魔力壶, 
"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot."

277
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,570
芭比兔与多话的树桩 ...
"Babbitty Rabbitty and the Cackling Stump."

278
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,710
来吧。 芭比兔...
Come on, Babbitty Rabbitty.

279
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,870
不要?
No?

280
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:06,010
"给哈利 詹姆 波特 ..."
"To Harry James Potter...

281
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:10,280
"... 我留给他首次参加霍尔华兹 魁地奇比赛的金色飞贼...
...I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts...

282
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:15,480
"... 以提醒他有努力就有收获 ... "
...as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance...

283
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,920
"... 技艺才能精进"
...and skill."

284
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:43,040
就这些? - 还没完。
- Is that it, then? - Not quite.

285
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:48,630
Dumbledore left you a second bequest:
邓不利多还留给你第二个遗物

286
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,850
戈浮德格兰芬多宝剑。
The sword of Godric Gryffindor.

287
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:58,060
不幸的是，邓不利多把剑送给别人了。
Unfortunately, the sword of Gryffindor was not Dumbledore's to give away.

288
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:01,200
此剑是一件重要历史宝物 它是属于 ...
As an important historical artifact, it belongs--

289
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:02,470
哈利的。
To Harry.

290
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,240
它属于哈利的。
It belongs to Harry.

291
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:08,110
他在密室时最需要它时找到它。
It came to him when he needed it in the Chamber of Secrets.

292
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,180
宝剑会为值得的格兰芬多学生出现 格兰杰小姐 ...
The sword may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor.

293
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,680
... 并不表示就是属于那个人的
That does not make it that wizard's property.

294
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,750
何况现今没人知道剑在哪里。
And, in any event, the current whereabouts of the sword are unknown.

295
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,520
你说什么? - 这剑遗失了
- Excuse me? - The sword is missing.

296
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:26,420
我不知道接下你要怎么做 波特先生 ...
I don't know what you're up to, Mr. Potter...

297
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,560
... 但是你不能单打独斗
...but you can't fight this war on your own.

298
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,140
他太强大了。
He's too strong.

299
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,260
。

300
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,590
你好, 哈利
Hello, Harry.

301
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,490
我打扰你想事情了吗?我从你眼睛看的出来
I've interrupted a deep thought, haven't I? I can see it growing smaller in your eyes.

302
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,200
当然没有。 你好, 卢娜
Of course not. How are you, Luna?

303
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,000
很好，就是刚被地精咬一下...。
Very well. Got bitten by a garden gnome only moments ago.

304
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,510
地精口水有益健康
Gnome saliva is very beneficial.

305
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,050
谢诺菲留斯 洛夫古德，我们住在对面山上。
Xenophilius Lovegood. We live just over the hill.

306
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,410
很高兴见到你, 先生。
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

307
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,350
我想你知道 波特先生 ..... 我们不同于...
I trust you know, Mr. Potter, that we at The Quibbler...

308
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,850
预言家日报的墙头草,
unlike those toadies at The Daily Prophet...

309
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,620
邓不利多在世时我们全力支持他 ... 
fully supported Dumbledore in his lifetime...

310
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:03,450
他过世了，我们就全力支持你
and, in his death, support you just as fully.

311
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,130
谢谢你
Thank you.

312
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,130
好了，爸爸。 哈利 现在没心思跟我们说话
Come, Daddy. Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now.

313
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,600
他只是礼貌的不想打断你。
He's just too polite to say so.

314
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,830
哈利?波特 ...
Harry Potter.

315
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,500
抱歉, 先生。- 我能坐下吗? 
Excuse me, sir? May I sit down?

316
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,080
波特先生。请便...请坐
Mr. Potter. By all means. Here.

317
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,910
谢谢
Thanks.

318
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,920
我发现你写在预言家日报的文章很感人。
I found what you wrote in The Daily Prophet really moving.

319
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:33,290
你一定很了解邓不利多
You obviously knew Dumbledore well.

320
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,390
是的，我认识他时间最长。
Well, I certainly knew him the longest.

321
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,290
除了他弟弟 阿不福思,
That is, if you don't count his brother, Aberforth...

322
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:42,490
不知怎么的，从来没人想起阿不福思。
and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.

323
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,890
我不知道他还有个弟弟。- 啊
I didn't even know he had a brother. - Ah.

324
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:48,630
当邓不利多还是个小孩时，有很多秘密
Well, Dumbledore was always very private, even as a boy.

325
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,730
。

326
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,210
别失望, 埃菲亚斯
Don't despair, Elphias.

327
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,810
我听说丽塔斯基特在书中爆料
I'm told he's been thoroughly unriddled by Rita Skeeter...

328
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,810
至少有800多页。
...in 800 pages, no less.

329
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:02,850
字里提到 跟她说的某人。
Word has it that someone talked to her.

330
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,820
对邓不利多家族知道甚多。
Someone who knew the Dumbledore family well.

331
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,820
相信你我都知道是谁 , 埃菲亚斯。
Both you and I know who that is, Elphias.

332
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,460
怪物的背叛行为
A monstrous betrayal.

333
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,960
你们说的是谁啊?
Who are we talking about?

334
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,560
巴希达 巴格肖特。
Bathilda Bagshot.

335
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,300
- 谁? - 噢, 小子...
- Who? - My God, boy...

336
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:26,240
... 她是上世纪最有名的魔法史家。
...she's only the most celebrated magical historian of the last century.

337
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:32,180
她跟邓不利多一家很亲密
She was as close to the Dumbledores as anyone.

338
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:37,380
哦，我确信为此就值得去趟戈德里克山谷 ...
Oh, I'm sure Rita Skeeter thought it well worth a trip to Godric's Hollow...

339
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,750
从老糊涂那听到些话来。
...to take a peek into that old bird's rattled cage.

340
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,760
戈德里克山谷?
Godric's Hollow?

341
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,090
巴希达 巴格肖特 住在戈德里克山谷?
Bathilda Bagshot lives at Godric's Hollow?

342
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,590
在那里她第一次见到邓不利多
Well, that's where she first met Dumbledore.

343
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,630
你不会说他也住在那里吧
You don't mean to say he lived there too?

344
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,360
在他的父亲杀了那三个麻瓜之后，他们举家搬到了那里
The family moved there after his father killed those three Muggles.

345
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:57,170
那时很轰动的丑闻。
Oh, it was quite the scandal.

346
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:02,180
说实话小子 ...你真的了解他吗?
Honestly, my boy, are you sure you knew him at all?

347
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,730
魔法部垮台了
The Ministry has fallen.

348
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,280
魔法部长已死。
The Minister of Magic is dead.

349
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,050
他们来了。
They are coming.

350
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,310
他们来了。
They are coming.

351
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,080
他们来了
They are coming.

352
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,720
他们来了
They're coming!

353
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,590
很高兴看到你, 波特先生。
Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter.

354
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:05,040
卢娜！哈利！快走！
- Ginny! - Harry! Go!

355
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,270
快走!
Go!

356
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:22,180
马上走，观光旅游吗？在15分钟内离开！
Here you go, sightseeing tour? Leaves in 15 minutes.

357
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:26,260
我们在哪里?- 在史夫兹百瑞街上
Where are we? - Shaftesbury Avenue.

358
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:29,630
我曾跟爸妈来这看歌剧。
I used to come to the theater here with Mom and Dad.

359
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:33,030
我不知道怎么会从脑里想到这个地方
I don't know why I thought of it. It just popped into my head.

360
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,270
这边走。
This way.

361
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,170
我们得换衣服
We need to change.

362
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,380
怎么换？  
How the ruddy...?

363
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:51,110
无痕伸展咒
Undetectable Extension Charm.

364
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,820
你太神了
You're amazing, you are.

365
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,590
你总是大惊小怪的 
Always the tone of surprise.

366
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,720
啊，书掉出去了
Ah. That'll be the books.

367
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,100
婚礼上的人怎么了 
What about all the people at the wedding?

368
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,740
你觉得我们该回去吗？ - 他们在找你！ 
 Do you think we should go back? - They were after you.

369
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:13,070
回去了大家就更危险了
We'd put everyone in danger by going back.

370
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,680
荣恩说的对  - 嗯
- Ron's right. - Ahem.

371
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,510
咖啡？
Coffee?

372
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:22,080
一杯卡布奇诺  - 你呢？
 A cappuccino, please. - You?

373
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,220
和她一样  - 我也是
- What she said. - Same.

374
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:33,430
我们等会去哪儿？破釜酒吧？
So where do we go from here? Leaky Cauldron?

375
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,890
那太危险了
It's too dangerous.

376
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,330
要是伏地魔占领魔法部，没有老地方是安全的了
If Voldemort has taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe.

377
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,560
所有参加婚礼的人都要躲起来
Everyone from the wedding will have gone underground, into hiding.

378
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,230
我的行李都留在陋居
My rucksack with all my things, I've left it at the Burrow.

379
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,280
你在开玩笑 
You're joking.

380
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:57,840
我这几天一直在收拾东西 预防万一
I've had all the essentials packed for days, just in case.

381
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,220
可惜这不是我喜欢的那条牛仔裤
By the way, these jeans, not my favorite.

382
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,450
趴下u
Down!

383
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,890
昏昏倒地u
Stupefy!

384
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,830
飞沙走石!
Expulso!

385
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,580
统统石化!
Petrificus Totalus.

386
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,780
走u 
Go.

387
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,380
离开这里u
Leave.

388
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,860
锁上门 把灯关掉
Lock the door, get the lights.

389
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,830
这人叫罗尔 
This one's name is Rowle.

390
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:51,780
那晚斯内普在天文台杀死邓不利多时他也在
He was on the Astronomy Tower the night 斯内普 killed Dumbledore.

391
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:57,070
我认为这是多洛霍夫 我曾在通缉单见过他
This is Dolohov. I recognize him from the wanted posters.

392
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:00,310
我们要怎么处理你呢？
So, what we gonna do with you, hey?

393
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,280
等你们复原过来杀我们
Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn't you?

394
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,790
杀了他们 我们就会暴露
If we kill them, they'll know we were here.

395
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,360
荣恩 
Ron.

396
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,480
想想他们怎么对付疯眼汉的 你什么感觉
Suppose he did Mad-Eye. How would you feel then?

397
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,090
抹去他们的记忆   
It's better we wipe their memories.

398
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,930
你说了算
You're the boss.

399
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,000
赫敏
Hermione...

400
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,940
你是咒语高手
you're the best at spells.

401
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,790
一切皆忘
Obliviate.

402
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,730
他们怎么知道我们在那
How is it they knew we were there?

403
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,500
也许你还带着踪丝
Maybe you still have the Trace on you?

404
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,110
不会 魔法规定，到了十七岁踪丝就会消失
Can't be. Trace breaks at 17. It's wizarding law.

405
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,470
唉啊
What?

406
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:10,250
我们没办法为你庆祝生日，哈利

没关系 赫敏 太感谢了 想想几分钟前 
I appreciate the thought, but given the fact that we were almost killed...

410
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,200
食死徒还在追杀我们呢!
by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago....

411
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,560
没关系

413
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,560
我们得离开这，找个安全地方
We need to get off the streets, get somewhere safe.

414
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,700
这是怎回事
What was that all about?

415
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,510
可能是疯眼汉的意思 防止斯内普来窥探

不 不 别的魔杖也可以
I believed another wand--

419
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:43,810
- 你骗我 - 这不可能
- You lied to me. - It makes no sense.

420
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,620
 换支魔杖也行 我发誓 
I believed a different wand would work, I swear.

421
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,180

434
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,220
你一直在偷听是吗
You've been spying on us, have you?

435

克利切一直在看着
Kreacher has been watching.

436
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,970
也许它知道真的挂坠盒在哪儿

你见过这东西吗？

441
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,510
另一个在那里？
Where's the other one?

442

克利切不知道另一个挂坠盒在哪里

你是什么意思？ 
How do you mean?

在雷古勒斯 主人死之前，他下令克利切破坏挂坠盒
Before Master Regulus died, he ordered Kreacher to destroy it...

452
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:16,390
但无论怎样努力 都毁不掉
but no matter how hard Kreacher tried, he could not do it.

453
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,150
嗯，现在它在那里？
Well, where is it now?

454
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,390
有人带走了吗？ 他那天晚上来了
- Did someone take it? - He came in the night.

Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley, which Dobby thought was curious.

疯眼汉从扫帚摔下我无法救他
Could I help it if Mad-Eye fell off his broom?

505
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,070
说实话

你发现挂坠盒 对吗

什么，它很值钱吗？

509
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:30,440
还在你手里吗
You still got it?

510
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:33,050
不会 他肯定后悔卖的价格太低
No, he's worried he didn't get enough money for it.

511
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,740
我亏大了 对不对
Bleeding give it away, didn't I?

512
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,250
跟你们说 当我在对角巷卖货时
There I was, flogging me wares in Diagon Alley...

513
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:43,380
 有个魔法部女巫，问我的许可证
when some Ministry hag comes up and asks to see me license.

514
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:45,690
她说她要把我抓起来
Says she's a mind to lock me up.

515
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:49,530
正要抓时 她看见那个挂坠盒
And would've done it too, if she hadn't taken a fancy to that locket.

516
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,640
是谁？ 巫婆，你认识她吗？不
Who was she? The witch. Do you know? - No, I--

519
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,840
噢! 这就他吗? 看

戴着蝴蝶结

好的 记得刚才我们说的

不要跟任何人讲， 除非万不得已
Don't speak to anyone unless absolutely necessary.

524
00:50:55,230 --> 00:51:00,140

Just try and act normal. Do what everybody else is doing.

526
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:03,700
如果幸运的话就能混到里面
If we do that, then with a bit of luck, we'll get inside.

527
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:05,470
然后，好戏上场
And then，It gets really tricky.

528
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,510
好极了，耶
Correct. Yeah.

529
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,580
这太疯狂了。 没错
- This is completely mental. - Completely.

530
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:12,770
这本来就是疯狂的世界 
The world's mental.

531
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:14,380
走吧
Come on

532
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,420
我们去找魂器

533
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:13,710
把自己冲下去
We flush ourselves in.

534
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:20,510
真是恶心
That's bloody disgusting.

535
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:50,210
l？
Name?

536
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,040

那些是 ... ? 麻瓜
Are those--? Muggles.

540
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:12,060
在他们该待的地方
In their rightful place.

541
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:17,030
让我告诉你 我开始有些怕
Gotta tell you, I'm starting to freak out a bit.

542
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:23,800
你说这复方汤剂能持续多久，赫敏？
How long did you say this batch of Polyjuice would last, Hermione?

543
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:25,370
不好说
I didn't.

544
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,490

It's still raining inside my office. That's two days now.

546
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,830
你试着打把伞看看？
Have you tried an umbrella?

547

你说谎，多洛雷斯
You're lying, Dolores.

702
01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:15,170
我发誓
I swear on my life.

703
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,200
我相信你
I believe you.

704
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:24,940
阿瓦达索命
Avada Kedavra!

705
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,090
我以为你不再想
I thought it had stopped.

706
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,430
你不能让他缠着你了 哈利
You can't keep letting him in, Harry.

708
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,440
神秘人找到格里戈维奇 
You-Know-Who has found Gregorovitch.

709
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,300
魔杖？
The wandmaker?

710
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:57,000
他想要格里戈维奇过去拥有的一样东西
He wants something that Gregorovitch used to have...

711
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:58,650
我不知道是什么
but I don't know what.

712
01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:04,810
但他拼命想要它 好像他的生命依靠那东西一样
But he wants it desperately. I mean, it's as if his life depends on it.

714
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,880
不要管
Don't.

715
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:10,250
他听一听会较好 它使我心神不宁
It comforts him. It sets my teeth on edge.

716
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:12,660
他期望听到什么好消息吗？
What's he expecting to hear, good news?

717
01:09:12,830 --> 01:09:15,700
谁想听到好消息了。魔法部垮台太令人震惊了
who long expected it, the fall of the Ministry was shocking.

718
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:18,230
我想他只是不希望听到坏消息而已
I think he just hopes he doesn't hear bad news.

719
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,340
一个人只能希望别听到坏消息
We promise to remain your eyes and ears--

720
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,940
他还要多久才能行走？
How long before he can travel?

721
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:25,300
不管我们在哪里，我们将尽可能给你一些新闻
bringing you news when we can, from wherever we can.

722
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:26,770
我们竭尽全力
I'm doing everything I can.

723
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:28,470
你做得还不够!
You're not doing enough!

724
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:33,240
把它摘下
Take it off.

725
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:36,580
我说， 现在把它摘下u
I said, take it off now.

727
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,330
好点吗？ 是
Better? Loads.

729
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:56,300
我们轮流带着，好吗？
We'll take it in turns, okay?

730
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:28,730
finch现在承认他的发明有个缺点
Finch does admit his invention currently has one short.

731
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:30,370
现在播送其他消息
And now, other news:

732
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:33,800
霍格华兹新任校长 赛佛勒斯 斯内普 
Severus snape, newly-appointed headmaster of Hogwarts...

733
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:37,740
重申所有学生必须严守新校规
...has decreed that all students must conform to the latest house rules.

734
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:09,810
霍格华兹对邓不利多领导下的积习不再容忍
Hogwarts bears little resemblance to the school under Dumbledore's leadership.

735
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:13,610
斯内普将按照黑魔王的意愿
snape's curriculum is severe, reflecting the wishes of the Dark Lord...

736
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:19,390
...and infractions are dealt with harshly by the two Death Eaters on staff.

737
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:40,210
谁在哪？
What's that?

738
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:52,250
什么味道
What's that smell?

739
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:16,740
你在干什么 很重 
What you doing? - It's heavy.

740
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:18,500
抱歉，要我帮忙吗？ 
Oh, sorry. Do you want me to carry it?

741
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:21,620
好的，谢谢了. 别闹了， 给我扛起来
Yeah, thank you. Don't be ridiculous. Pick it up.

742
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:24,210
混账
Numpty.

743
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:31,320
搜捕队 
Snatchers.

744
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,800
你的魔咒很灵验
Good to know your enchantments work.

745
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,460
他闻出我的香水味
He could smell it. My perfume.

746
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:47,730
I've told you...

747
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:50,040
我告诉你 荣恩还不能幻影显形
Ron isn't strong enough to Apparate.

748
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:53,940
没什么我们可以步行去
Well, then, we'll go on foot.

749
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:59,690
我喜欢你的香水味，但下次别用它
And next time, Hermione, as much as I like your perfume, just don't wear any.

751
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:08,460
失踪巫师名单播报
And now for the names of missing witches and wizards.

752
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:11,490
这些被确认了
These are confirmed.

753
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:15,700
还好名单不长
Thankfully, the list is short today.

754
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,500
Jason and Alison Denbright.

755
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:20,400

William and Brian Gallagher.

768
01:13:58,210 --> 01:14:00,650
他不知道他做什么 是吧？
He doesn't know what he's doing, does he?

770
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:05,390
我们都不会做
None of us do.

771
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,720
Toby and Olivia Gleaves.

772
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:14,220

01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:46,440
噢，我的天u ？
Oh, my God.

778
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:48,440
什么
What?

779
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:51,040
等会告诉你 
I'll tell you in a minute.

780
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:54,280
你现在能告诉我吗？
Maybe you could tell me now.

781
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:57,680
格兰芬多剑是妖怪做的
The sword of Gryffindor, it's goblin-made.

782
01:14:57,860 --> 01:14:58,950
太棒了了
Brilliant.

783
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:02,430
不，你不明白
No, you don't understand.

784
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:05,130
土和锈对剑刃是没有侵蚀性
Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade.

785
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:09,500
只会使它更强大
It only takes in that which makes it stronger.

786
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:11,270
好 ...
Okay.

787
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,930
你已摧毁一个魂器了知道吗
Harry, you've already destroyed one Horcrux, right?

788
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:17,380
汤姆放在密室的日记 
Tom Riddle's diary in the Chamber of Secrets.

789
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:20,450
是由于巴西里克毒牙
With a Basilisk fang. If you tell me you've got one of those...

790
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:24,070
你那百宝囊不会连这也有吧...
in that bloody beaded bag of yours.... - Don't you see?

791
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:27,980
你难道不明白吗？ 在密室你用格兰芬多剑刺死巴希里克
In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed the Basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor.

792
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:31,680
其剑身是浸渍巴希里克的毒液
Its blade is impregnated with Basilisk venom.

793
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:33,950
使它更强大了
It only takes in that which makes it stronger.

794
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:37,290
正好，这是为什么 它能破坏魂器
- Exactly, which is why-- - It can destroy Horcruxes.

795
01:15:37,470 --> 01:15:39,730
这就是为什么邓不利多在他的遗嘱留给了你
That's why Dumbledore left it to you in his will.

796
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:44,310
你很聪明，郝敏 真的
You are brilliant, Hermione. Truly.

797
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:48,530
实际上，我仅仅想大方向逻辑思惟， 这使我看到过去的和不相干的细节...
Actually, I'm highly logical, which allows me to look past extraneous detail...

798
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:51,200
这样才能到别人不能看到的
and perceive clearly that which others overlook.

799
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:54,080
是的，只有一个麻烦
Yeah, there's only one problem, of course.

800
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:01,580
剑被偷了
The sword was stolen.

801
01:16:02,990 --> 01:16:05,520
是的，而我仍然在这里 
Yeah, I'm still here.

802
01:16:06,030 --> 01:16:10,160
你俩继续聊 别扫了你们兴
But you two carry on. Don't let me spoil the fun.

804
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:15,530
怎么了？ 有毛病吗？  没毛病
What's wrong? - Wrong? Nothing's wrong.

805
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,600
不是你想象那样 
Not according to you, anyway.

806
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:21,400
好了，如果你有话要说，别憋着，都说出来
Look, if you've got something to say, don't be shy. Spit it out.

807
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:25,080
好的，我说出来，别以为找到新线索
All right, I'll spit it out. But don't expect me to be grateful...

809
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:27,770
我就会很感激
because there's another damn thing we've gotta find.

810
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:30,210
我想你知道你期望什么
I thought you knew what you signed up for.

811
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,580
是啊，我想我也是
Yeah. I thought I did too.

812
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,780
好，抱歉，但是我确实不太明白
Well then, I'm sorry, but I don't quite understand.

813
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:39,420
哪部分没有符合你的期望呢？
What part of this isn't living up to your expectations?

814
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,860
你以为住在饭店
Did you think we were gonna be staying in a hotel?

815
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:45,300
隔天就能找到一个魂器 很快能回家跟妈妈过圣诞节？
Finding a Horcrux every other day? Thought you'd be back by Christmas?

816
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:47,300
我想都过这么久了， 
I just thought, after all this time...

817
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:50,910
应该有收获吧，我以为你知道自己知道要做什么
we would've achieved something. I thought you knew what you were doing.

818
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:53,470
我以为邓不利多把一切都告诉你了
I thought Dumbledore told you something worthwhile.

819
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:56,840
我以为你已经有了计划，而你却不知道如何摧毁魂器
I thought you had a plan. - I told you everything Dumbledore told me.

820
01:16:57,010 --> 01:16:59,210
我们找到了一个魂器
In case you haven't noticed, we found a Horcrux.

821
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:03,250
我们要毁灭它容易着呢，找到其他魂器也一样容易
Yeah, and we're as close to getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them.

822
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:06,010
荣恩，请摘下魂器...
Ron. Please, take--

823
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,960
如果你没有整天挂着它 你就不会这样说
Take the Horcrux off. You wouldn't be saying this...

824
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,460
你知道
if you hadn't been wearing it all day.

825
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:13,030
每天晚上我为什么听收音机？
Want to know why I listen to that radio?

826
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:17,860
为了确保我没有听到金妮的名字， 弗雷德和乔治或母亲...
To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name, or Fred, or George or Mom.

827
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:21,200
你认为我不知道吗？你认为我不知道它的感受吗？
You think I'm not listening? You think I don't know how this feels?!

828
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:22,840
你不知道它是怎么样的感觉啊u
No, you don't know how it feels!

829
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:25,370
你的父母死了u 你没有家了u
Your parents are dead. You have no family.

830
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,210
够了u  够了u 你走吧u  走吧u
- Stop. Stop. - Fine, then go!

831
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:31,210
走吧！
Go, then!

832
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,140
好
Fine.

833
01:17:38,290 --> 01:17:39,950
荣恩 ...
Ron.

834
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:44,990
你呢？
And you?

835
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:49,250
你要走或者要留下？
Are you coming or you staying?

836
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:59,430
好  我明白了 我看见你两个不久前的那晚
Fine. I get it.

837
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,040
I saw you two the other night.

838
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,880
荣恩 ... 这没有什么
Ron, that's-- That's nothing.

839
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:08,380
荣恩u
Ron--

840
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:13,920
荣恩，你要去哪儿？
Ron, where are you going?

841
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:17,150
求求你 回来啊u
Please, come back.

842
01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:20,320
荣恩
Ron.

843
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:26,060
荣恩！！！
Ron!

844
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:30,990
统统守卫
Salvio Hexia.

845
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:36,900
麻瓜屏蔽
Repellum Muggletum.

846
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:42,410
统统守卫
Salvio Hexia.

848
01:20:03,730 --> 01:20:06,390
Poor old Jim's white as a ghost

849
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:10,400
He's found the answer that we lost

850
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:14,240
We're all weeping now Weeping because

851
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:20,370
There ain't nothing we can do To protect you

852
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:24,240
O children

853
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:31,920
Lift up your voice

854
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:37,590
Lift up your voice

855
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:40,000
Children

856
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:49,440
Rejoice, rejoice

857
01:20:49,610 --> 01:20:53,010
Hey, little train, we're jumping on

858
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:56,910
The train that goes to the kingdom

859
01:20:57,450 --> 01:21:00,620
We're happy, Ma We're having fun

860
01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:04,920
And the train ain't even left the station

861
01:21:05,090 --> 01:21:08,460
Hey, little train, wait for me

862
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:12,500
I once was blind but now I see

863
01:21:12,670 --> 01:21:16,000
Have you left a seat for me?

864
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:20,300
Is that such a stretch of the imagination?

865
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:23,810
Hey, little train, wait for me

866
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:27,850
I was held in chains but now I'm free

867
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:31,050
I'm hanging in there Don't you see?

868
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:35,680
In this process of elimination

869
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:38,990
Hey, little train, we're jumping on

870
01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:42,690
The train that goes to the kingdom

871
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:46,600
We're happy, Ma We're having fun

872
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:50,670
It's beyond my wildest expectation

873
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:54,070
Hey, little train, we're jumping on

874
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:57,870
The train that goes to the kingdom

875
01:21:58,410 --> 01:22:01,610
We're happy, Ma We're having fun

876
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:06,650
我在结束时打开打
The train ain't even left the station

878
01:22:53,370 --> 01:22:54,860
赫敏
Hermione.

879
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,370
赫敏，你说对了
Hermione? You were right.

880
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:59,100
你说对了 金色飞贼确实有实体记忆 ...
Snitches have flesh memories...

881
01:22:59,270 --> 01:23:03,900
第一次我不适用手抓的 我差点吞了下去
...but I didn't catch the first Snitch with my hand, I almost swallowed it.

882
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:11,950
"我在结束时打开 "你认为那是什么？
"I open at the close." - What do you think that means?

883
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,520
我不知道
I don't know.

884
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,320
我也找到一样东西
I found something as well.

885
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:28,160
最初我认为它是只眼睛， 现在发现不是
At first I thought it was an eye, but now I don't think it is.

886
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:32,500
这不是如尼文， 在音标表里也查不到
It isn't a rune, and it isn't anywhere in Spellman's Syllabary.

887
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:36,070
是墨水留下的
Somebody inked it in. It isn't part of the book. Somebody drew it.

888
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:39,910
这不是书印上的 是画的
Luna's dad was wearing that at Bill and Fleur's wedding.

889
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:40,080
我在婚礼看见卢纳的爸爸戴着这符号

890
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:45,950
为什么会有人在童书里画这个？
Why would someone draw it in a children's book?

891
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,990
赫敏，我一直考虑
Look, Hermione, I've been thinking.

892
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,650
我想要去戈德里克山谷
I want to go to Godric's Hollow.

893
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:56,890
我出生的地区，我的父母死的地方
It's where I was born. It's where my parents died.

894
01:23:57,070 --> 01:24:00,660
他一定会猜到你会去那 对你一定不寻常
That's exactly where he'll expect you to go because it means something to you.

895
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:03,270
对他也不寻常，赫敏
Yeah, but it means something to him too, Hermione.

896
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,430
神秘人差点死在那里
You-Know-Who almost died there.

897
01:24:05,610 --> 01:24:10,270
那不正可能他藏魂器的地方？
I mean, isn't that exactly the type of place he'd be likely to hide a Horcrux?

898
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:13,810
很危险的，哈利
It's dangerous, Harry.

899
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:19,410
就算危险 我们也只好去一趟
But even I have to admit, recently I've been thinking we'll have to go there.

900
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:22,020
我觉得可能有其它什么隐藏着
I think it's possible something else is hidden there.

901
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:23,710
什么？
What?

902
01:24:24,430 --> 01:24:26,120
剑
The sword.

903
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:30,500
如果邓不利多想让你找到它， 不要让它落入魔法部手中
If Dumbledore wanted you to find it, but didn't want it in the Ministry's hands...

904
01:24:30,670 --> 01:24:34,860
最好的地方藏在格兰芬多 创始人的出生地
where better to hide it than the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor?

906
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:38,070
赫敏...
Hermione....

907
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:46,040
不要再让我帮你剪头发了
Don't ever let me give you a haircut again.

908
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:09,960
我认为我们应该用变形药水
I still think we should've used Polyjuice Potion.

909
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:11,660
不 方
No.

910
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:14,540
这是我出生的地
This is where I was born.

911
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,280
我不想化身回来
I'm not returning as someone else.

912
01:25:27,090 --> 01:25:30,080
晚安
Good night. Ha-ha-ha.

913
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:35,890
哈利，今天是圣诞夜吧
Harry, I think it's Christmas Eve.

914
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:38,700
听着
Listen.

915
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:47,240
你认为他们在这里吗？赫敏
Do you think they'd be in there, Hermione?

917
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,670
我的妈妈和爸爸
My mom and dad.

918
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:57,880
我想是的 他们在
Yeah, I think they would.

920
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:37,520
伊格诺图斯 帕沃瑞奥
"Ignotus Peverell."

922
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:41,220
嘿，哈利？
Hey, Harry?

924
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:21,300
圣诞快乐，赫敏
Merry Christmas, Hermione.

925
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:24,830
圣诞快乐，哈利
Merry Christmas, Harry.

927
01:27:44,690 --> 01:27:50,100
哈利，在教堂附近有人正看着我们
Harry, there's someone watching us. By the church.

929
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:02,640
我想我知道那是谁
I think I know who that is.

930
01:28:04,510 --> 01:28:05,950
我不知道，哈利
I don't like this, Harry.

931
01:28:06,110 --> 01:28:11,140 
赫敏，他认识邓不利多 她可能有剑
Hermione, she knew Dumbledore. She might have the sword.

933
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:31,630
这是他们死的地方，赫敏
This is where they died, Hermione.

935
01:28:39,210 --> 01:28:41,680
这是他杀他们的地方
This is where he murdered them.

937
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,130
你是巴希尔达吗
You're Bathilda, aren't you?

938
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:03,830
来，让我来做
Here, let me do that.

939
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:31,870
巴沙特太太，这个男人是谁？
Miss Bagshot, who is this man?

941
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:45,140
哈利
Harry.

942
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:51,050
荧光闪烁
Lumos.

943
01:30:38,930 --> 01:30:53,640
你是哈利 有东西给你

944
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:32,440
哈利
Harry!

945
01:32:23,270 --> 01:32:24,330
霹雳爆炸
Confringo!

946
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:09,210
你感觉好点了吗？
Are you feeling better?

947
01:33:12,290 --> 01:33:14,760
这次表现真好，赫敏
You've outdone yourself this time, Hermione.

948
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:17,020
迪安森林
The Forest of Dean.

949
01:33:17,990 --> 01:33:22,360
多年以前我曾经跟我爸妈来到这里。。
I came here once with Mom and Dad, years ago.

950
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,120
还是记忆中一样
It's just how I remember it.

951
01:33:25,530 --> 01:33:29,470
树木，河流，所有一切
The trees, the river, everything.

952
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:32,600
没有什么改变
Like nothing's changed.

953
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,830
当然不可能，一切已经改变
Not true, of course. Everything's changed.

954
01:33:37,810 --> 01:33:41,610
如果这时我的父母在，就没有什么？
If I brought my parents back here now, they probably wouldn't recognize any of it.

955
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:47,850
树变了
Not the trees, not the river...

956
01:33:46,630 --> 01:33:48,320
河变了

957
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:51,750
甚至我
...not even me.

958
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:59,700
也许我们该留在这里，哈利
Maybe we should just stay here, Harry.

959
01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:03,830
慢慢变老？
Grow old.

960
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:13,140
想要知道相框的男孩是谁吗
You wanted to know who the boy in the photograph was.

961
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:14,970
我知道
I know.

962
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:18,550
盖勒特 格林德沃
Gellert Grindelwald.

963
01:34:25,490 --> 01:34:28,890
他是我在格里戈维奇商店里看见的贼
He's the thief I saw in Gregorovitch's Wand Shop.

964
01:34:29,060 --> 01:34:32,330
说道魔杖 我的魔杖在那里？
Speaking of which, where is my wand?

965
01:34:33,670 --> 01:34:36,070
我的魔杖到那里去了，赫敏？
Where's my wand, Hermione?

966
01:34:44,710 --> 01:34:49,210
离开戈德里克山谷时 我施魔咒 击中它
As we were leaving Godric's Hollow, I cast a curse and it rebounded.

968
01:34:51,950 --> 01:34:53,180
对不起
I'm sorry.

969
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:56,480
我努力修理它，但没修好 没有什么
I tried to mend it, but wands are different. It's done.

971
01:34:58,460 --> 01:35:02,420
你的借我用 进去暖和一下
Leave me yours. Go inside and get warm.

973
01:35:02,830 --> 01:35:05,160
我也来看看魂器
I'll take the locket as well.

975
01:35:17,710 --> 01:35:19,080
相信我
Trust me.

976
01:36:44,830 --> 01:36:46,460
荧光闪烁
Lumos.

978
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:28,910
宝剑飞来u
Accio sword.

980
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:36,650
四分五裂
Diffindo.

982
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:20,250
赫敏？你迷糊了？
- Hermione? - Are you mental?

983
01:39:19,610 --> 01:39:20,710


984
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:23,010
是你？
It was you?

985
01:39:23,190 --> 01:39:26,960
是的 不是我是谁
Well, yeah. Bit obvious, I think.

987
01:39:27,130 --> 01:39:28,930
那只小鹿也是你召唤的吧
And you cast the doe as well, did you?

988
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:33,160
不，我以为是你召的 不是，我的守护神是牡鹿
- No, I thought that was you. - No, my Patronus is a stag.

989
01:39:33,330 --> 01:39:35,530
了解 有鹿角的
Right. Yeah. Antlers.

990
01:39:38,710 --> 01:39:41,870
好，荣恩 你来
Okay, Ron. Do it.

992
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:46,570
我无法做到.比你和赫敏来说这东西对我影响更大
I can't handle it. That thing affects me more than it affects you and Hermione.

994
01:39:47,110 --> 01:39:49,740
我不行
All the more reason. - No. I can't.

995
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:51,150
那你来做什么
Then why are you here?

996
01:39:52,550 --> 01:39:54,610
你为什么回来？
Why did you come back?

998
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:06,330
我跟它说话时叫它打开，不要犹豫
Now, I'll have to speak to it in order for it to open. When it does, don't hesitate.

1000
01:40:06,930 --> 01:40:09,460
不知道里面是什么，但是它会反抗
I don't know what's in there, but it'll put up a fight.

1001
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:12,330
就像汤姆日记里要杀死我的灵魂记忆
The bit of Riddle that was in that diary tried to kill me.

1002
01:40:14,810 --> 01:40:16,440
好了
All right.

1003
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,840
一
One...

1004
01:40:19,510 --> 01:40:20,570
二
...two...

1005
01:40:21,250 --> 01:40:23,150
三
...three.

1006
01:40:33,390 --> 01:40:38,490
我看见你的心，它是我的
I have seen your heart, and it is mine.

1007
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:45,000
我看见你的梦，荣恩卫斯里
I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley...

1008
01:40:45,170 --> 01:40:47,570
我看见你的恐惧
...and I have seen your fears.

1009
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:53,440
你母亲不喜欢你，喜好女儿
Least loved by your mother, who craved a daughter.

1010
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:59,080
那女孩不喜欢你 喜欢你的朋友
Least loved by the girl who prefers your friend.

1011
01:40:59,250 --> 01:41:01,980
荣恩u快刺
Ron, kill it!

1012
01:41:08,430 --> 01:41:11,130
我们没有你更好
We were better without you.

1013
01:41:11,630 --> 01:41:13,360
 没有你更快乐  我同意
Happier without you.

1014
01:41:13,530 --> 01:41:18,900
有哈利在身边 谁要看你一眼 与哈利波特相比
Who could look at you compared to Harry Potter?

1016
01:41:20,140 --> 01:41:23,470
你算什么
What are you compared with the Chosen One?

1017
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:24,800
荣恩，它说谎u
Ron, it's lying!

1018
01:41:24,980 --> 01:41:27,970
你的母亲承认，她更想让我当她儿子
Your mother confessed she would have preferred me as a son.

1019
01:41:28,150 --> 01:41:31,140
哪个女人会要你？
What woman would take you?

1020
01:41:31,350 --> 01:41:34,520
你什么都不是 
You are nothing.

1021
01:41:34,690 --> 01:41:35,820
什么都不是
Nothing.

1022
01:41:36,590 --> 01:41:40,620
与他相比 什么都不是
Nothing compared to him.

1023
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:32,840
想想看 
Just think...

1024
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:35,840
还剩三个魂器
...only three to go.

1025
01:42:38,890 --> 01:42:40,620
赫敏？
Hermione?

1026
01:42:42,890 --> 01:42:44,620
赫敏？
Hermione?

1027
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:51,100
一切还好吗？
Is everything all right?

1028
01:42:51,730 --> 01:42:56,400
好 ... 比实际上非常好
It's fine. Actually, you know, it's more than fine.

1029
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:02,430
嗨
Hey.

1030
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:12,880
你 ...你这混蛋 荣恩韦斯利！
You complete ass, Ronald Weasley!

1032
01:43:13,050 --> 01:43:16,720
你走了几星期，回来就说'嗨'？
You show up here after weeks, and you say "hey"?

1033
01:43:18,930 --> 01:43:21,660
哈利，我的魔杖在那里？
- Where's my wand? Where's my wand? - I don't know.

1034
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:24,090
我的魔杖在那里？ 我不知道
- Harry Potter, give me my wand. - I don't have it.

1035
01:43:21,470 --> 01:43:23,650
哈利?波特 你还我魔杖u

1036
01:43:24,270 --> 01:43:28,100
你的魔杖怎么在他那？ 他拿我的魔杖关你什么事
- How come he's got your wand? - Never mind why he's got my wand.

1037
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:31,600
那是什么？
What is that?

1038
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:35,570
你毁了它
You destroyed it.

1039
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:42,840
它是怎样发生的，你怎么有格兰芬多剑？
And how is it that you just happen to have the sword of Gryffindor?

1040
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:45,220
说来话长
It's a long story.

1041
01:43:48,390 --> 01:43:52,490
不要以为它能改变任何事情 当然不会
- Don't think this changes anything. Oh, of course not.

1043
01:43:52,660 --> 01:43:55,930
我只不过摧毁了魂器， 为什么会改变什么
I only just destroyed a bloody Horcrux. Why would that change anything?

1044
01:43:56,100 --> 01:44:00,160
听我说 我一离开就想回来
Look, I wanted to come back as soon as I left.

1045
01:44:00,330 --> 01:44:03,770
就不知道怎样找到你 你怎么找到我们的？
- I just didn't know how to find you. - Yeah, how did you find us?

1046
01:44:03,940 --> 01:44:07,000
用这个 它不只能熄灯
With this. It doesn't just turn off lights.

1047
01:44:07,170 --> 01:44:12,080
我不知道它怎样运作 圣诞节早上我睡在酒店内 ...
I don't know how it works, but Christmas morning I was sleeping in this little pub...

1048
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:14,680
...躲开那些搜捕者
...keeping away from some Snatchers...

1049
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:16,380
当我听到它 
...and I heard it.

1050
01:44:16,780 --> 01:44:18,220
什么？
It?

1051
01:44:19,550 --> 01:44:21,490
声音
A voice...

1052
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:24,280
你的声音，赫敏
...your voice, Hermione...

1053
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:27,090
在它外面传出来
...coming out of it.

1054
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:31,100
请问我说了什么 我的名字
- And what exactly did I say, may I ask? - My name.

1056
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:33,720
只不过是我名字
Just my name.

1057
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:36,590
像轻声一样
Like a whisper.

1058
01:44:38,570 --> 01:44:44,570
因此我拿起它，点了它 ...小光球出现
So I took it, clicked it, and this tiny ball of light appeared.

1060
01:44:45,050 --> 01:44:46,480
我明白 
And I knew.

1061
01:44:47,050 --> 01:44:51,680
充分相信，真的 小光球飞向我的胸口
And sure enough, it floated toward me, the ball of light...
1063
01:44:53,390 --> 01:44:57,590
直接穿透过我的胸 从这里
...went right to my chest, straight through me. Right here.

1064
01:44:58,790 --> 01:45:02,790
我知道它要带我到我需要去的地方 我就幻影移形
And I knew it was gonna take me where I needed to go, so I Disapparated...

1065
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:05,230
来到这个山坡
...and came to this hillside.

1066
01:45:05,770 --> 01:45:08,290
天已经暗了，我知道没有别的办法
It was dark. I had no idea where I was.

1067
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:11,670
我只希望 你们其中一个出现
I just hoped that one of you would show yourself.

1068
01:45:12,570 --> 01:45:14,100
真出现了
And you did.

1069
01:45:31,530 --> 01:45:34,430
我一直很喜欢郝敏弄的这些火焰
I've always liked these flames Hermione makes.

1070
01:45:38,470 --> 01:45:41,030
你认为多久她才会对我不再生气？
How long do you reckon she'll stay mad at me?

1071
01:45:42,570 --> 01:45:45,900
你说说小光球怎么进入你的心里
Well, just keep talking about that little ball of light touching your heart...

1072
01:45:46,070 --> 01:45:47,510
她将会原谅你 
...and she'll come round.

1073
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:50,410
真的 每句话都是真的
It was true. Every word.

1074
01:45:52,210 --> 01:45:54,580
这真是不可思议
This is gonna sound crazy...

1075
01:45:55,050 --> 01:45:59,420
但是我想，这是邓不利多给我熄灯器的用意？
...but I think that's why Dumbledore left it to me, the Deluminator.

1076
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:04,910
他大概知道我要靠它引路回来 就让它引导回来
I think he knew that somehow I'd need it to find my way back, and she'd lead me.

1077
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:10,530
我想起你要一根魔杖 
Bloody hell, I just realized, you need a wand, don't you?

1078
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:13,190
对 我这有一个
Yeah. - I've got one here.

1079
01:46:13,470 --> 01:46:16,060
黑刺李木长10英寸，
It's a blackthorn. Ten inches.

1080
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:19,830
没什么特别 不过还能用
Nothing special, but I reckon it'll do.

1081
01:46:20,270 --> 01:46:23,070
几个星期前，从一个搜捕者偷来的
Took if off a Snatcher a couple of weeks ago.

1082
01:46:23,580 --> 01:46:27,410
不要告诉郝敏 这个蠢事
Don't tell Hermione this, but they're a bit dim, Snatchers.

1084
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:30,620
它的气味 绝对是一个巨怪血统
This one was definitely part troll, the smell of him.

1085
01:46:30,780 --> 01:46:31,810
速速变大
Engorgio.

1086
01:46:31,990 --> 01:46:34,150
速速变小 出什么事 
- Reducio! - What's going on in there?

1087
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:35,580
没事 没事
Nothing. Nothing.

1088
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:39,590
我们需要谈谈
We need to talk.

1089
01:46:40,390 --> 01:46:41,590
耶 好吧
Yeah, all right.

1090
01:46:48,570 --> 01:46:52,100
我想要去看谢诺菲留斯 洛夫古德 什么？
- I want to go see Xenophilius Lovegood. - Sorry?

1092
01:46:53,870 --> 01:46:55,500
看到了吗？ 
See this?

1093
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:59,540
这是邓不利多写了一封信给格林德瓦 看签名
It's a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald. Look at the signature.

1095
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:02,980
又是那标志
It's the mark again.

1096
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:06,040
它一再出现
It keeps cropping up.

1097
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:10,590
在故事中，在戈德里克墓碑上
In Beedle the Bard, in the graveyard in Godric's Hollow.

1098
01:47:11,430 --> 01:47:13,290
它也在上面
It was there too.

1099
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:17,060
在那里？ 在格里戈维奇的魔杖商店外边
- Where? - Outside Gregorovitch's Wand Shop.

1100
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:18,730
它代表什么意思？ 
But what does it mean?

1101
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:23,700
看，你我都不知道下一个魂器在那里
Look, you've got no idea where the next Horcrux is, and neither do I...

1102
01:47:25,410 --> 01:47:28,340
但这表示某些迹象 我肯定
...but this, this means something.

1103
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:32,080
我确信它 是呀 赫敏说的对
- I'm sure of it. - Yeah. Hermione's right.

1104
01:47:33,110 --> 01:47:35,210
我们应该看洛夫古德
We ought to see Lovegood.

1105
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:39,450
让我们表决。同意的举手
Let's vote on it. Those in favor?

1106
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:05,910
你还在生他气吗？
You're not still mad at him, are you?

1107
01:48:06,210 --> 01:48:08,480
我一直在生他的气 
I'm always mad at him.

1108
01:48:11,250 --> 01:48:12,740
卢纳
Luna.

1109
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:14,620
卢纳
Luna.

1110
01:48:22,300 --> 01:48:25,130
勿触摸飞船李子
"Keep off the dirigible plums."

1111
01:48:34,170 --> 01:48:36,870
找谁？ 你是谁？
What is it? Who are you?

1112
01:48:37,180 --> 01:48:38,200
你想要什么？
What do you want?

1113
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:42,970
你好，洛夫古德先生 我是哈利?波特，几个月以前见过面
Hello, Mr. Lovegood. I'm Harry Potter. We met a few months ago.

1115
01:48:46,990 --> 01:48:48,890
我们能进来吗？
Could we come in?

1116
01:48:52,660 --> 01:48:55,250
卢纳在那里？ 卢纳？
- Where is Luna? - Luna?

1118
01:48:56,530 --> 01:48:58,500
她快到了
She'll be along.

1120
01:49:12,010 --> 01:49:14,070
所以...我要怎么帮助你，波特先生？
So how can I help you, Mr. Potter?

1121
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:17,940
噢，实际上 ...
Well, actually....

1122
01:49:18,950 --> 01:49:23,480
是关于在婚礼上你戴在脖子的 一个符号
It was about something you were wearing round your neck at the wedding. A symbol.

1123
01:49:25,030 --> 01:49:26,930
你说的是这吗？ 
You mean this?

1124
01:49:27,330 --> 01:49:28,920
是的
Yes.

1125
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:31,090
就是它
That exactly.

1126
01:49:31,770 --> 01:49:35,720
我想知道 ... 它是什么？
What we've wondered is, what is it?

1127
01:49:35,900 --> 01:49:37,730
它是什么？
What is it?

1128
01:49:37,910 --> 01:49:40,870
嗯。。它是死神圣物的标记
Well, it's the sign of the Deathly Hallows, of course.

1129
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:42,130
什么？ 什么？
- The what? - The what?

1130
01:49:42,310 --> 01:49:44,370
死神圣物 
The Deathly Hallows.

1131
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:47,640
我以为你们都熟悉三兄弟的传说？
I assume you're all familiar with "The Tale of the Three Brothers."

1132
01:49:47,810 --> 01:49:49,300
是的 没有
- Yes. - No.

1133
01:49:54,660 --> 01:49:56,420
我这里有一本
I have it in here.

1134
01:50:07,670 --> 01:50:09,300
从前有三兄弟，
"There were once three brothers...

1135
01:50:09,470 --> 01:50:13,870
黄昏时刻在一条偏僻羊肠小路道赶路 ...
...who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight."

1137
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:16,770
妈妈总是说半夜
Midnight. Mom always said "midnight."

1138
01:50:21,780 --> 01:50:25,650
黄昏 也可以 其实际更好  
But "twilight's" fine. Better, actually.

1139
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:29,790
要不你来念
Do you want to read it?

1140
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:32,150
不 你念就好
No. It's fine.

1141
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:36,000
从前有三兄弟.
"There were once three brothers...

1142
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:41,360
在一条偏僻羊肠小路道赶路 ..天色已是黄昏
...who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight.

1144
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:48,540
他们到一条河边 河水太极他们过不去
In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass.

1145
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:50,740
但他们曾经学过魔法 三兄弟挥舞着魔杖。。
But being learned in the magical arts...

1146
01:50:50,910 --> 01:50:56,080
一座桥就搭建起来
...the three brothers simply waved their wands and made a bridge.

1148
01:50:57,420 --> 01:50:59,510
然尔他们要过桥时 
Before they could cross, however...

1149
01:50:59,690 --> 01:51:03,780
一位披斗篷的人挡住他们
...they found their path blocked by a hooded figure.

1150
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:07,930
它是死神 它觉得被戏弄
It was Death, and he felt cheated.

1152
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:11,160
因为平常人，通常在这条河里淹死
Cheated because travelers would normally drown in the river.

1153
01:51:11,330 --> 01:51:13,390
但是死神很狡猾的
But Death was cunning.

1154
01:51:14,030 --> 01:51:17,030
他假装祝贺三个兄弟。他们的魔法。。
He pretended to congratulate the three brothers on their magic...

1155
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:22,470
理应奖赏...说他们相当聪明逃过一死
...and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him.

1157
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:27,610
老大最好战 他想要一根 天底下最有威力的魔杖
The oldest asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence.

1158
01:51:27,780 --> 01:51:32,380
死神就从身边的接骨木 制作一根魔杖给他
So Death fashioned him one from an elder tree that stood nearby.

1159
01:51:33,790 --> 01:51:38,090
第二个弟弟是个骄傲的人 他决定进一步戏弄死神。。
The second brother decided he wanted to humiliate Death even further...

1160
01:51:38,260 --> 01:51:42,700
...并且要求有起死回生的能力
...and asked for the power to recall loved ones from the grave.

1161
01:51:43,130 --> 01:51:47,430
因此死神从这条河挑一块石头 并且提供给他
So Death plucked a stone from the river and offered it to him.

1162
01:51:48,170 --> 01:51:52,130
最后，死神转向了老三
Finally, Death turned to the third brother.

1163
01:51:53,340 --> 01:51:54,770
他是个谦虚的人 
A humble man...

1164
01:51:54,940 --> 01:51:59,140
他想要能帮他离开那地方...
...he asked for something that would allow him to go forth from that place...

1165
01:51:59,310 --> 01:52:02,480
不会被死神跟踪
...without being followed by Death.

1166
01:52:03,580 --> 01:52:09,450
因此，死神将自己的隐形斗篷 不情愿地交给他的
And so it was that Death reluctantly handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.

1167
01:52:12,830 --> 01:52:15,760
第一个兄弟旅行到一个遥远的村庄 ...
The first brother traveled to a distant village...

1168
01:52:15,930 --> 01:52:18,020
用死神给他的接骨木魔杖
...where, with the Elder Wand in hand...

1169
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:21,960
杀死了与他曾经有过争吵的巫师
he killed a wizard with whom he had once quarreled.

1170
01:52:24,170 --> 01:52:27,700
魔杖巨大威力让他欣喜若狂。。
Drunk with the power that the Elder Wand had given him...

1171
01:52:27,870 --> 01:52:30,970
他吹嘘它 没有可战胜他的？
...he bragged of his invincibility.

1172
01:52:33,980 --> 01:52:37,440
但是在那个夜晚 另一名巫师偷走这根魔杖...
But that night, another wizard stole the wand...

1173
01:52:37,620 --> 01:52:40,750
并且切开老大的喉咙
...and slit the brother's throat for good measure.

1174
01:52:40,950 --> 01:52:44,390
因此为了他自己死神带走第一个兄弟
And so Death took the first brother for his own.

1176
01:52:45,130 --> 01:52:47,090
第2个兄弟旅行回家，
The second brother journeyed to his home...

1177
01:52:47,260 --> 01:52:50,230
他带着石头 在他的手里转动它三次
...where he took the stone and turned it thrice in hand.

1178
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:54,860
令他兴奋的是 他曾经想在她早逝之前跟她结婚的一位女孩
To his delight, the girl he'd once hoped to marry before her untimely death...

1180
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:57,400
出现在他面前
appeared before him.

1181
01:52:57,900 --> 01:53:03,210
但是不久她变悲哀而冷淡 因为她不属于凡人世界
Yet, soon she turned sad and cold for she did not belong in the mortal world.

1183
01:53:03,380 --> 01:53:05,000
渴望与失望逼疯了
Driven mad with hopeless longing...

1184
01:53:05,180 --> 01:53:08,480
第二个弟弟 他自杀身亡 以便与她一起
the second brother killed himself so as to join her.

1185
01:53:09,680 --> 01:53:12,780
因此死神带走第二个兄弟
And so Death took the second brother.

1186
01:53:12,950 --> 01:53:14,580
至于第三个兄弟
As for the third brother...

1187
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:18,990
离开多年 死神始终无法找到他
Death searched for many years but was never able to find him.

1188
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:22,060
直到老三活到很老
Only when he attained a great age did the youngest brother...

1189
01:53:22,230 --> 01:53:26,500
摆脱披风，然后交给了他的儿子...
...shed the Cloak of Invisibility and give it to his son.

1190
01:53:27,730 --> 01:53:31,860
然后像一位老朋友一样迎接死神
He then greeted Death as an old friend and went with him gladly...

1192
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:35,200
并且高兴地随死神一起离开这世界
departing this life as equals."

1193
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:41,770
就这样那 些就是死神圣物
So there you are. Those are the Deathly Hallows.

1195
01:53:43,180 --> 01:53:46,240
对不起先生 我仍然不太了解
I'm sorry, sir. I still don't quite understand.

1197
01:53:51,860 --> 01:53:53,950
我的笔在哪？
Where's that pen I had?

1198
01:54:04,940 --> 01:54:06,200
接骨木杖
The Elder Wand.

1199
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:11,000
这世界最强有力的魔杖
The most powerful wand ever made.

1201
01:54:21,390 --> 01:54:23,690
复活石头
The Resurrection Stone.

1203
01:54:34,570 --> 01:54:38,330
隐形斗篷
The Cloak of Invisibility.

1204
01:54:40,370 --> 01:54:43,500
Together, they make the Deathly Hallows.

1205
01:54:43,780 --> 01:54:49,240
合在一起成为死神圣物
Together, they make one master of Death.

1206
01:54:45,890 --> 01:54:51,930
合在一起成为死神的主人

1207
01:54:54,450 --> 01:54:58,120
在戈德里克坟墓上也有标记
That mark was on a grave in Godric's Hollow.

1209
01:54:59,230 --> 01:55:01,850
洛夫古德先生 佩夫雷尔家人
Uh, Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell Family...

1210
01:55:02,030 --> 01:55:03,860
与死神圣物有无关系
have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?

1211
01:55:04,030 --> 01:55:06,860
Uh-- Uh--

1212
01:55:07,030 --> 01:55:10,800
伊格诺图斯 请让我过一下 和他的兄弟卡德莫斯 安提俄克 
Ignotus-- Excuse me. --and his brothers, Cadmus and Antioch...

1213
01:55:10,970 --> 01:55:13,630
传说就是死神圣物的最初拥有者
are thought to be the original owners of the Hallows...

1214
01:55:13,810 --> 01:55:18,680
故事就是这么来的
and therefore the inspiration for the story. Uh-- Uh--

1216
01:55:18,850 --> 01:55:21,340
茶都已经变凉
But your tea's gone cold.

1217
01:55:22,550 --> 01:55:24,540
不要走 我马上回来
I'll be right back.

1218
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:26,580
Let's go down here.

1219
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:29,950
我们走吧
Let's get out of here.

1220
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:32,990
不管茶凉的热的我都不想喝了
I'm not drinking any more of that stuff, hot or cold.

1221
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:41,270
先生 感谢你 ... 
Thank you, sir.

1222
01:55:42,170 --> 01:55:45,190
你忘烧水了 水吗？ 
You forgot the water. - Water?

1223
01:55:45,370 --> 01:55:46,810
泡茶用的
For the tea.

1224
01:55:46,970 --> 01:55:49,530
我忘了吗？
Did--? Did I?

1225
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:53,640
我多脑残啊
How silly of me.

1226
01:55:55,250 --> 01:55:57,510
没关系 我们也要走了
It's no matter. We really should be going anyway.

1227
01:55:57,680 --> 01:55:59,740
不，你不能走u
No, you can't!

1228
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:05,650
先生？
Sir?

1229
01:56:13,030 --> 01:56:15,630
你是我唯一的希望
You're my only hope.

1230
01:56:19,510 --> 01:56:23,880
我写的东西使他们很忿怒
They were angry, you see, about what I'd been writing.

1231
01:56:26,910 --> 01:56:29,040
因此他们抓走 ...
So they took her.

1232
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:33,280
抓走我的孩子
They took my Luna.

1233
01:56:34,990 --> 01:56:36,620
我的孩子
My Luna.

1234
01:56:49,100 --> 01:56:52,000
他们想抓的是你
But it's really you they want.

1235
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:56,300
先生，谁抓走卢纳？
Who took her, sir?

1236
01:57:01,450 --> 01:57:02,710
伏地魔
Voldemort.

1237
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:15,660
我抓到他们u
Stop! I've got him!

1238
01:57:32,950 --> 01:57:36,850
奸诈的小杂种u就没可相信的任何人吗？
That treacherous little bleeder. Is there no one we can trust?

1239
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:39,320
他支持我卢纳才被抓走
They kidnapped her because he supported me.

1240
01:57:39,490 --> 01:57:41,610
他急着救他
He was just desperate.

1241
01:57:42,160 --> 01:57:44,350
我去施保护咒
I'll do the enchantments.

1242
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:57,470
你好 美女
Hello, beautiful.

1243
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:06,570
别站着 去抓他们
Well, don't hang about, snatch them.

1244
01:59:17,820 --> 01:59:19,310
哈利 
Harry.

1245
01:59:19,490 --> 01:59:22,460
告诉我 告诉我，它在哪里
Tell me, Grindelwald. Tell me where it is.

1246
01:59:23,060 --> 01:59:27,120
格林德瓦 格林德瓦 格林德瓦
Grindelwald. Grindelwald. Grindelwald.

1248
01:59:27,860 --> 01:59:31,320
汤姆我知道 有一天你会来
Hello, Tom. I knew you would come one day...

1250
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:35,760
你要的东西已经不再我手里
...but surely you must know I no longer have what you seek.

1251
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:39,430
我相信你格林德瓦，告诉我在哪里
Tell me, Grindelwald. Tell me where it is. - Ha-ha-ha.

1252
01:59:39,610 --> 01:59:40,970
告诉我谁拿它
Tell me who possesses it.

1253
01:59:41,170 --> 01:59:46,270
这根接骨木魔杖 当然要跟他在一起 ...
The Elder Wand lies with him, of course...

1254
01:59:46,450 --> 01:59:48,710
被埋在土里
buried in the earth.

1255
01:59:49,650 --> 01:59:50,980
与邓不利多一起
Dumbledore.

1256
02:00:00,030 --> 02:00:01,890
那些圣物真的存在 
The Hallows exist...

1257
02:00:02,060 --> 02:00:05,860
他只在找最后那个 他知道圣物在那里
but he's only after one of them, the last one. He knows where it is.

1259
02:00:06,030 --> 02:00:09,870
今晚他就会拿到 神秘人会找到那魔杖
He's gonna have it by the end of the night. You-Know-Who's found the Elder Wand.

1260
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:12,500
不要碰她u
- Don't touch her. Unh! - Leave him.

1261
02:00:12,670 --> 02:00:13,930
你的男朋友会吃更都多苦 
Your boyfriend will get worse than that...

1262
02:00:14,110 --> 02:00:15,230
放开我
Get off me.

1263
02:00:15,410 --> 02:00:18,140
如果他再不老实的话
if he doesn't learn to behave himself.

1264
02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:22,870
你肿麽了 丑八怪
What happened to you, ugly?

1265
02:00:24,580 --> 02:00:26,450
不，不是说你
No, not you.

1266
02:00:27,850 --> 02:00:30,910
你叫什么名字？ 达力  弗农?达力
What's your name? - Dudley. Vernon Dudley.

1267
02:00:31,090 --> 02:00:33,290
检查它
Check it.

1268
02:00:34,890 --> 02:00:37,230
你他和丑八怪
And you, my lovely...

1269
02:00:40,530 --> 02:00:42,520
他们叫你什么？
...what do they call you?

1270
02:00:43,970 --> 02:00:48,030
潘纳洛普 克利尔沃特 混血
Penelope Clearwater, half-blood.

1271
02:00:51,140 --> 02:00:53,080
这里上没有叫弗农?达力
There's no Vernon Dudley on here.

1272
02:00:54,150 --> 02:00:57,380
你听到那丑八怪说的？ 名单说你在对我们说谎
Did you hear that, ugly? The list says you're lying.

1273
02:00:57,550 --> 02:00:59,780
你为什么没告诉我们？  你是谁？ 
How come you don't want us to know who you are?

1274
02:00:59,950 --> 02:01:02,620
名单有误，我已经告诉你我是谁
The list's wrong. I told you who I am.

1275
02:01:18,570 --> 02:01:20,660
更改计划
Change of plan.

1276
02:01:21,740 --> 02:01:25,010
不把他们带到魔法部里
We're not taking this lot to the Ministry.

1277
02:02:04,680 --> 02:02:08,310
到德拉科
Get 德拉科.

1278
02:02:12,790 --> 02:02:14,350
那么？
Well?

1279
02:02:17,460 --> 02:02:21,990
我不能确定 马份 你看仔细
- I can't be sure. - 德拉科. Look closely, son.

1281
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:28,070
如果是我们抓住哈利波特 交给黑魔王...
If we are the ones to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord...

1282
02:02:28,240 --> 02:02:33,470
他就原谅我们 我们又可回到从前了 明白吗
everything would be forgiven. All would be as it was, you understand?

1283
02:02:33,650 --> 02:02:37,780
别忘记是谁真正抓到他...我希望 马尔福先生
Now, we won't be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy.

1285
02:02:37,950 --> 02:02:40,390
你怎敢在我家里跟我这样讲话 u
You dare to talk to me like that in my own house?

1286
02:02:40,550 --> 02:02:42,350
卢修斯
Lucius.

1287
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:49,090
不要怕羞，到这来u
Don't be shy, sweetie. Come over.

1289
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:55,360
如果这不是我们要找的人，叫黑魔王来，他会把我们都杀了 我们得确定是他！
Now, if this isn't who we think it is, 德拉科, and we call him, he'll kill us all.

1291
02:02:55,540 --> 02:02:58,330
We need to be absolutely sure.

1292
02:02:58,640 --> 02:02:59,630
他的脸怎么了？   
What's wrong with his face?

1293
02:02:59,810 --> 02:03:01,540
是的 他的脸怎么了
Yes, what is wrong with his face?

1294
02:03:01,710 --> 02:03:02,900
见到他就这样
He came to us like that.

1295
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:05,040
大概得到什么病
Something he picked up in the forest, I reckon.

1296
02:03:05,210 --> 02:03:08,910
也许中了咒 是你干的吗
Or ran into a Stinging Jinx. Was it you, dearie?

1297
02:03:14,020 --> 02:03:16,780
把魔杖给我，我看看他最后施什么咒
Give me her wand. We'll see what her last spell was.

1298
02:03:18,060 --> 02:03:20,220
落在我手里了吗
Ah. Got you.

1299
02:03:24,030 --> 02:03:25,760
那是什么？
What is that?

1300
02:03:27,700 --> 02:03:29,290
你从哪儿得到的？
Where'd you get that from?

1301
02:03:29,470 --> 02:03:32,960
从他包里搜出来的，我猜现在是我的了
It was in her bag when we searched her. Reckon it's mine now.

1302
02:03:36,710 --> 02:03:38,040
你发什么疯
Are you mad?

1303
02:03:46,350 --> 02:03:49,190
滚u滚u
Go! Get out!

1304
02:03:54,830 --> 02:03:58,990
西西 ...把那两个小子关到地牢去u
Cissy, put the boys in the cellar.

1306
02:03:59,170 --> 02:04:04,540
我想要单独与他谈谈。。两个女人之间u
I want to have a little conversation with this one, girl-to-girl.

1308
02:04:13,580 --> 02:04:16,670
我们要怎么办 我们不能让赫敏单独和她在一块
What are we gonna do? We can't leave Hermione alone with her.

1309
02:04:16,850 --> 02:04:18,210
荣恩？
Ron?

1310
02:04:23,420 --> 02:04:24,980
哈利？
Harry?

1311
02:04:30,700 --> 02:04:32,250
卢纳？
Luna?

1312
02:04:32,870 --> 02:04:37,030
剑应该在我的金库里 你怎样拿到的？
That sword is meant to be in my vault at Gringotts. How did you get it?

1313
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:40,330
