1
00:00:07,315 --> 00:00:15,122

2
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:30,408


3
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:41,246
黑暗已经降临 我们无法避免
These are dark times, there is no denying.

4
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:47,492
也许 我们的世界正在经历前所未有的危机
Our world has, perhaps, faced no greater threat than it does today.

5
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:52,425
但是我想告诉公众:
But I say this to our citizenry:

6
00:00:52,604 --> 00:00:56,506
我们 作为公仆...
We, ever your servants...

7
00:00:56,675 --> 00:00:59,337
将会保护你们的自由...
will continue to defend your liberty...

8
00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:03,845
我们要与邪恶势力斗争到底
and repel the forces that seek to take it from you.

9
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:10,317
魔法部仍然...
Your Ministry remains...

10
00:01:10,855 --> 00:01:12,823
坚不可摧
strong.

11
00:01:17,734 --> 00:01:19,790
预言家日报: 黑魔标记 邪恶再现

12
00:01:22,887 --> 00:01:27,951
麻瓜家庭被灭门

13
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:32,370
赫敏 茶煮好了 亲爱的
Hermione. Tea's ready, darling.

14
00:01:32,544 --> 00:01:34,478
这就来 妈妈
Coming, Mom.

15
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:40,316
快点 达力 快一点
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

16
00:01:40,485 --> 00:01:43,511
我们为什么一定要走
I still don't understand why we have to leave.

17
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:48,455
因为这里对我们来说太危险了
Because, unh, it's not safe for us here anymore.

18
00:02:03,842 --> 00:02:08,211
罗恩 叫你爸回来吃晚饭
Ron, tell your father supper's nearly ready.

19
00:02:13,218 --> 00:02:14,947
这是澳大利亚吗?
Is this in Australia?

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,088
看起来真棒 不是吗?
Looks wonderful, doesn't it?

21
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:22,124
沿着澳大利亚的东海岸绵延三千五百公里
Three and a half thousand kilometers along Australia's east coast.

22
00:02:23,428 --> 00:02:24,952
一忘皆空
Obliviate.

23
00:03:32,432 --> 00:03:44,250
哈利波特与死亡圣器 上

24
00:04:39,297 --> 00:04:40,958
西弗勒斯
Severus.

25
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:44,499
我以为你迷路了呢
I was beginning to worry you had lost your way.

26
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:48,127
快坐下 我们给你留了位置
Come, we've saved you a seat.

27
00:04:52,577 --> 00:04:53,908
我相信你又带来好消息了 是吗?
You bring news, I trust?

28
00:04:54,078 --> 00:04:57,741
他们会在下个周六行动 日落时分
It will happen Saturday next, at nightfall.

29
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,282
我听到的消息恰恰相反 主人
I've heard differently, my Lord.

30
00:05:00,451 --> 00:05:03,579
傲罗德力士透露说波特...
Dawlish, the Auror, has let slip that the Potter boy...

31
00:05:03,755 --> 00:05:06,849
会在本月三十日才动身
will not be moved until the 30th of this month.

32
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:08,554
也就是在他十七岁生日前一天
The day before he turns 17.

33
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:11,957
你的消息错了
This is a false trail.

34
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,794
傲罗已经不再负责保护哈利波特
The Auror Office no longer plays any part in the protection of Harry Potter.

35
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:21,337
他们认为魔法部已被我们渗透了
Those closest to him believe we have infiltrated the Ministry.

36
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,532
还真被他们猜中了 是吧?
Well, they got that right, haven't they?

37
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:30,480
你有什么要说的 皮尔斯?
What say you, Pius?

38
00:05:34,018 --> 00:05:36,612
我也是一头雾水 主人
One hears many things, my Lord.

39
00:05:36,788 --> 00:05:39,348
搞不清谁说的是真话
Whether the truth is among them is not clear.

40
00:05:39,524 --> 00:05:42,891
哈哈 你说话还真像政客
Heh. Spoken like a true politician.

41
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:46,121
皮尔斯 你应该证明一下自己的价值了
You will, I think, prove most useful, Pius.

42
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:52,965
- 那孩子会被带到哪里?  - 安全的地方
- Where will he be taken, the boy?  - To a safe house.

43
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:55,999
有可能是凤凰社成员的家里
Most likely the home of someone in the Order.

44
00:05:56,174 --> 00:05:59,405
我听说那里已经戒备森严
I'm told it's been given every manner of protection possible.

45
00:05:59,577 --> 00:06:03,172
一旦他到了那儿 我们就束手无策了
Once there, it will be impractical to attack him.

46
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:08,285
主人 我自愿前去完成这个任务
Ahem. My Lord. I'd like to volunteer myself for this task.

47
00:06:08,453 --> 00:06:09,442
我想亲手解决那孩子
I want to kill the boy.

48
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,016
虫尾巴!
Wormtail!

49
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,159
我没告诉过你让客人安静点吗?
Have I not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet?

50
00:06:15,326 --> 00:06:17,226
是的 主人
Yes, my Lord.

51
00:06:17,395 --> 00:06:20,057
马上好 主人
Right away, my Lord.

52
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:24,792
虽然我很欣赏你嗜血成性 贝拉特里克斯...
As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix...

53
00:06:25,236 --> 00:06:28,535
但是我必须亲手杀了哈利波特
I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.

54
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:35,810
但是我遇到了一个很棘手的问题
But I face an unfortunate complication.

55
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:41,179
我的魔杖和波特的魔杖有相同的杖芯
That my wand and Potter's share the same core.

56
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:48,984
就像是双胞胎
They are, in some ways, twins.

57
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,859
我们可以伤害对方 但是无法杀死对方
We can wound, but not fatally harm one another.

58
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:58,264
如果我想要杀了他...
If I am to kill him...

59
00:06:58,937 --> 00:07:02,703
那我就必须用别人的魔杖
I must do it with another's wand.

60
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:10,409
我想你们之中肯定有人愿意把魔杖奉献给我吧?
Come, surely one of you would like the honor?

61
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:13,677
是吗?
Mm?

62
00:07:15,386 --> 00:07:20,187
你说呢 卢修斯?
What about you, Lucius?

63
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:24,093
主人 您是说?
My Lord?

64
00:07:24,262 --> 00:07:26,230
又装傻了?
"My Lord?"

65
00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:30,927
我需要你的魔杖
I require your wand.

66
00:07:44,248 --> 00:07:46,716
这是榆木做的吧?
Do I detect elm?

67
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:48,852
是的 主人
Yes, my Lord.

68
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:57,727
那杖芯呢?
And the core?

69
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:00,090
是龙的...
Dragon. Ahem.

70
00:08:00,264 --> 00:08:01,891
是龙的心脏腱索 主人
Dragon heartstring, my Lord.

71
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:04,261
- 龙的心脏腱索  - 是的
- Dragon heartstring.  - Mm.

72
00:08:19,984 --> 00:08:21,747
也许有些人还不知道...
To those of you who do not know...

73
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,581
今晚我们还邀请了凯瑞迪・布巴吉女士...
we are joined tonight by Miss Charity Burbage...

74
00:08:24,756 --> 00:08:30,251
她此前一直在霍格沃茨任教
who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

75
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:33,886
负责教授麻瓜研究课程
Her specialty was Muggle Studies.

76
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:43,370
布巴吉女士相信我们与麻瓜并无太大差别
It is Miss Burbage's belief that Muggles are not so different from us.

77
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:47,170
她的理论是 让我们...
She would, given her way...

78
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,879
与麻瓜们一起生活
have us mate with them.

79
00:08:53,551 --> 00:08:59,751
对她来说 麻瓜与巫师结合并不是什么丢脸的事...
To her, the mixture of magical and Muggle blood is not an abomination...

80
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:02,950
而是应该鼓励的事
but something to be encouraged.

81
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:05,893
西弗勒斯
Severus.

82
00:09:06,064 --> 00:09:08,032
西弗勒斯 救救我
Severus, please.

83
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,861
我们是朋友
We're friends.

84
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:18,199
阿瓦达索命!
Avada Kedavra!

85
00:09:28,453 --> 00:09:30,478
纳吉尼
Nagini.

86
00:09:34,092 --> 00:09:35,753
去吃晚餐吧
Dinner.

87
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:24,466
- 嘿 哈利  - 你们终于来了
- Hello, Harry.  - All right. Wow.

88
00:11:24,635 --> 00:11:25,727
嘿
Hello.

89
00:11:25,903 --> 00:11:28,804
- 你看起来精神不错嘛  - 他看起来意气风发
- You're looking fit.  - Yeah, he's absolutely gorgeous.

90
00:11:28,973 --> 00:11:31,441
不如我们再等等好让人来干掉他吧?
What say we get undercover before someone murders him?

91
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:32,633
晚上好
Evening.

92
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:39,948
金斯莱 你不用保护麻瓜首相吗
Kingsley, I thought you were looking after the Prime Minister.

93
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,017
你比他更重要
You are more important.

94
00:11:42,186 --> 00:11:45,246
- 很高兴见到你 哈利 我是比尔・韦斯莱  - 我也很高兴见到你
- Hello, Harry. Bill Weasley.  - Oh. Pleasure to meet you.

95
00:11:45,423 --> 00:11:48,415
- 他以前可没这么帅  - 超丑的
- He was never always this handsome.  - Dead ugly.

96
00:11:48,593 --> 00:11:49,992
那是真的
True enough.

97
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:52,686
全拜狼人所赐 他叫格雷伯克
Owe it all to a werewolf, name of Greyback.

98
00:11:52,863 --> 00:11:56,230
- 真希望有天能让他血债血偿  - 在我心里你就是最美的 威廉
- Hope to repay the favor one day.  - You're still beautiful to me, William.

99
00:11:56,601 --> 00:12:00,230
一定要记住 芙蓉 比尔吃牛排最好煎得嫩一点
Just remember, Fleur, Bill takes his steaks on the raw side now.

100
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:02,736
我老公 总是那么有趣
My husband, the joker.

101
00:12:02,907 --> 00:12:06,172
顺便说一句 你们一定听说了 莱姆斯和我...
By the way, wait till you hear the news. Remus and I...

102
00:12:06,344 --> 00:12:08,778
行了行了 我们之后有的是时间闲聊
All right. We'll have time for a cozy catch-up later.

103
00:12:08,946 --> 00:12:11,915
我们必须马上离开这儿 马上
We've got to get the hell out of here. And soon.

104
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,848
波特 你年纪还没到 也就意味着你身上仍有踪丝
Potter, you're underage, which means you've still got the Trace on you.

105
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:16,848
{\an8}踪丝 魔法部用来监控未成年巫师施法的手段 巫师满17岁后自动消失

106
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,044
什么踪丝?
What's the Trace?

107
00:12:17,221 --> 00:12:19,883
你打个喷嚏 魔法部都知道是谁给你擦的鼻子
If you sneeze, the Ministry will know who wipes your nose.

108
00:12:20,057 --> 00:12:23,220
必须采取不用魔法的方式转移你:
We have to use those means of transport the Trace can't detect:

109
00:12:23,394 --> 00:12:25,726
骑扫帚 夜骐什么的 两人一组
Brooms, Thestrals and the like. We go in pairs.

110
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:29,662
这样 如果有人在外面守株待兔 肯定有...
That way, if anyone's out there waiting for us, and I reckon there will be...

111
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:32,325
他们也不知道哪个哈利・波特才是真的
they won't know which Harry Potter is the real one.

112
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,930
什么叫真的?
The real one?

113
00:12:35,273 --> 00:12:38,367
我想这药水你应该不陌生吧
I believe you're familiar with this particular brew.

114
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,840
不 绝对不要
No. Absolutely not.

115
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:42,343
我说吧 他不会同意的
I told you he'd take it well.

116
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:45,641
不 我不想大家为我一个人冒生命危险 我...
No, if you think I'm gonna let everyone risk their lives for me, I...

117
00:12:45,816 --> 00:12:48,876
- 我们又不是没干过 是吗?  - 不不 这次不一样
- Never done that before, have we?  - No. No. This is different.

118
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:51,044
我是说 喝了药水变成我 这不行
I mean, taking that, becoming me. No.

119
00:12:51,222 --> 00:12:53,053
哥们 你以为我们愿意变成你
Well, none of us really fancy it, mate.

120
00:12:53,224 --> 00:12:57,388
万一出问题 我们可就终身变成你那小鸡仔样了
Imagine if something went wrong, and we ended up a scrawny, specky git forever.

121
00:12:57,561 --> 00:12:59,222
我们每个人都成年了 波特
Everyone here is of age, Potter.

122
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,363
他们都愿意冒这个险
They've all agreed to take the risk.

123
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:05,634
准确的说 我是被强迫的
Technically, I've been coerced.

124
00:13:05,803 --> 00:13:07,998
蒙顿格斯・弗莱奇 波特先生
Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter.

125
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:10,732
- 久仰大名今日终得一见  - 闭嘴 蒙顿格斯
- Always been a huge admirer.  - Nip it, Mundungus.

126
00:13:12,043 --> 00:13:14,534
好了 格兰杰 按照事前商定的
All right, Granger, as discussed.

127
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:17,442
- 轻点 赫敏  - 劳驾把头发放进来
- Blimey, Hermione.  - Straight in here, if you please.

128
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:31,489
还没尝过复方汤剂的人 给你们一个忠告
For those of you who haven't taken Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning:

129
00:13:31,662 --> 00:13:33,289
这味道像妖精尿
It tastes like goblin piss.

130
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:36,433
看来你常喝啊 疯眼汉
Have a lot of experiences with that, do you, Mad-Eye?

131
00:13:37,335 --> 00:13:40,270
我只是缓和一下气氛
Just trying to diffuse the tension.

132
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:43,102
噢
Oh.

133
00:13:46,177 --> 00:13:47,940
呃
Ugh.

134
00:14:12,203 --> 00:14:14,262
哇 一模一样
Wow, we're identical.

135
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:15,496
这还不算
Not yet, you're not.

136
00:14:19,176 --> 00:14:21,736
你除了运动衫就不穿别的衣服吗?
Haven't got anything a bit more sporting, have you?

137
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:23,379
这颜色看起来好丑
I don't really fancy this color.

138
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:26,345
行了 赶快穿上 你现在不是你 给我闭嘴赶快换衣服
Well, fancy this, you're not you. So shut it and strip.

139
00:14:26,517 --> 00:14:28,075
好的好的 遵命
All right, all right.

140
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:29,810
你也要换衣服 波特
You'll need to change too, Potter.

141
00:14:30,321 --> 00:14:32,949
比尔 别看我 好丑
Bill, look away. I'm hideous.

142
00:14:33,124 --> 00:14:35,422
金妮还说你有纹身呢
I knew she was lying about that tattoo.

143
00:14:35,593 --> 00:14:38,027
哈利 你视力实在太糟了
Harry, your eyesight really is awful.

144
00:14:38,195 --> 00:14:41,892
好了 现在我们要分组 每个波特都有一个护卫
Right, then. We'll be pairing off. Each Potter will have a protector.

145
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:45,365
蒙顿格斯 你跟着我 我得看着你
Mundungus, stick tight to me. I wanna keep an eye on you.

146
00:14:45,903 --> 00:14:47,734
- 那么哈利...  - 啊?
- As for Harry...  - Yes?

147
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:49,971
真的哈利
The real Harry.

148
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:52,507
- 你到底是哪一个?  - 我在这儿
- Where the devil are you, anyway?  - Here.

149
00:14:52,676 --> 00:14:54,644
你和海格一起
You'll ride with Hagrid.

150
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:59,840
我十六年前带你来这里的时候你还没一个护树罗锅大呢
I brought you here 16 years ago when you were no bigger than a Bowtruckle.

151
00:15:00,017 --> 00:15:02,918
看来带你离开这儿的人也就我最合适了
Seems only right that I should be the one to take you away now.

152
00:15:03,087 --> 00:15:06,022
是的 的确很感人 我们出发
Yes, it's all very touching. Let's go.

153
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:23,238
方向陋居 我们在那里集合
Head for the Burrows. We'll rendezvous there.

154
00:15:23,774 --> 00:15:25,833
我数三下
On the count of three.

155
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,739
坐稳了 哈利
Hold tight, Harry.

156
00:15:27,912 --> 00:15:29,709
一...
One...

157
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:32,378
二...
two...

158
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:40,586
三!
three!

159
00:16:10,588 --> 00:16:13,751
- 是哪一个?  - 你在哪儿?
- Which one?  - Where are you?

160
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,688
他在你右边!
He's on your right!

161
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:18,488
他在那边!
He's over there!

162
00:16:18,662 --> 00:16:20,323
在下面!
Down!

163
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:27,464
海格 我们得回去帮他们!
Hagrid, we have to help the others!

164
00:16:27,872 --> 00:16:30,773
不行 哈利 疯眼汉的命令
I can't do that, Harry. Mad-Eye's orders.

165
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:39,512
抓紧了
Hang on.

166
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,379
昏昏倒地!
Stupefy!

167
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:00,195
坐稳了 哈利
Hang on, Harry.

168
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:11,979
海格
Hagrid.

169
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:31,463
不 不
No. No.

170
00:17:53,557 --> 00:17:55,548
哈利
Harry.

171
00:19:15,506 --> 00:19:18,566
哈利 海格
Harry. Hagrid.

172
00:19:19,977 --> 00:19:23,435
怎么样了? 其他人在哪里?
What happened? Where are the others?

173
00:19:23,614 --> 00:19:24,774
还没有人回来吗?
Is no one else back?

174
00:19:24,948 --> 00:19:28,509
我们是一起出发的 莫丽 他们可能还要一会儿
They were on us right from the start, Molly. We didn't stand a chance.

175
00:19:28,686 --> 00:19:31,849
谢天谢地你们两个没事
Well, thank goodness you two are all right.

176
00:19:32,022 --> 00:19:34,582
食死徒伏击了我们
The Death Eaters were waiting for us. It was an ambush.

177
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,158
罗恩和唐克斯早该到了
Ron and Tonks should've already been back.

178
00:19:37,327 --> 00:19:38,521
老爸和弗雷德也该到了
Dad and Fred as well.

179
00:19:41,465 --> 00:19:43,126
来搭把手!
Here!

180
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:47,203
快点进屋
Quick. Into the house.

181
00:19:50,874 --> 00:19:52,933
哦 宝贝儿
Oh, my boy.

182
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:57,603
怎么会这样
Oh. Oh.

183
00:19:59,216 --> 00:20:00,513
- 卢平!  - 你要干嘛?
- Lupin!  - What are you doing?

184
00:20:03,053 --> 00:20:05,988
你第一次到我在霍格沃茨的办公室...
What creature sat in the corner...

185
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:09,455
办公室的角落里是什么生物?
the first time Harry Potter visited my office in Hogwarts?

186
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,253
- 你疯了吗?  - 什么生物?!
- Are you mad?  - What creature?!

187
00:20:11,428 --> 00:20:13,259
是一只格林迪洛
A Grindylow.

188
00:20:19,603 --> 00:20:21,264
我们被出卖了
We've been betrayed.

189
00:20:21,438 --> 00:20:23,838
伏地魔知道你在今晚动身
Voldemort knew you were being moved tonight.

190
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:26,908
我必须弄清你是不是奸细
I had to make sure you weren't an impostor.

191
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:35,484
站住
Wait.

192
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:43,017
阿不思・邓布利多跟我俩说的最后一句话是什么?
The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?

193
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:49,197
"哈利是我们最宝贵的希望 相信他"
"Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him."

194
00:20:53,737 --> 00:20:54,829
你怎么逃出来的?
What gave you away?

195
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:58,202
我想是海德薇 她想要保护我
Hedwig, I think. She was trying to protect me.

196
00:21:14,758 --> 00:21:15,918
谢谢
Thanks.

197
00:21:16,093 --> 00:21:18,254
他配得上你 他很聪明
Deserves that. Brilliant, he was.

198
00:21:18,428 --> 00:21:21,522
- 没有他我不可能活着到这儿  - 真的吗?
- I wouldn't be standing here without him.  - Really?

199
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:25,195
至于这么惊讶吗
Always the tone of surprise.

200
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,604
我们是最后一队?
We the last back?

201
00:21:35,913 --> 00:21:36,937
乔治在哪里?
Where's George?

202
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:00,465
你感觉怎么样 乔治?
How you feeling, Georgie?

203
00:22:02,472 --> 00:22:03,996
仙乐飘飘啊
Saint-like.

204
00:22:05,209 --> 00:22:06,437
你说什么?
Come again?

205
00:22:07,377 --> 00:22:10,938
动听啊
Saint-like. I'm holy.

206
00:22:11,448 --> 00:22:14,508
瞧 这有个洞 洞听 弗雷德 懂了吗?
I'm holey, Fred. Get it?

207
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,019
耳朵的俏皮话多得是 你偏偏挑了"洞听"
The whole wide world of ear-related humor and you go for "I'm holey."

208
00:22:21,191 --> 00:22:22,351
真够可怜的
That's pathetic.

209
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,258
就算这样我还是比你帅
Reckon I'm still better-looking than you.

210
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,994
疯眼汉死了
Mad-Eye's dead.

211
00:22:41,378 --> 00:22:45,109
蒙顿格斯一看到伏地魔就幻影移形了
Mundungus took one look at Voldemort and Disapparated.

212
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:10,063
方向陋居
Head for the Burrows.

213
00:23:10,874 --> 00:23:12,239
这真是难以置信
This is beyond anything I imagined.

214
00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:15,037
- 七个?  - 七个...? 魂器
- Seven?  - Seven...? A Horcrux.

215
00:23:15,212 --> 00:23:16,645
他们可能被藏在任何地方
They could be hidden anywhere.

216
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:19,008
为了把灵魂分成七块...
To rip the soul into seven pieces....

217
00:23:19,182 --> 00:23:22,151
- 如果你摧毁了所有魂器...  - 你就击败了了伏地魔
- If you did destroy each Horcrux....  - One destroys Voldemort.

218
00:23:25,756 --> 00:23:27,383
相信我
Trust me.

219
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:31,886
你骗了我 骗了我 奥利凡德
You lied to me. Lied to me, Ollivander.

220
00:24:03,827 --> 00:24:05,761
要去哪里?
Going somewhere?

221
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:13,529
不能再有人为我而死了
Nobody else is going to die. Not for me.

222
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:15,501
为你?
For you?

223
00:24:15,672 --> 00:24:17,902
你觉得疯眼汉是为你而死的?
You think Mad-Eye died for you?

224
00:24:18,075 --> 00:24:21,010
你觉得乔治负伤也是为了你?
You think George took that curse for you?

225
00:24:21,778 --> 00:24:25,714
也许你真是救世之星 但这一切远比你重要得多
You may be the Chosen One, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that.

226
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:28,407
一直比你想的重要得多
It's always been bigger than that.

227
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,111
- 跟我一起走  - 什么 撇下赫敏?
- Come with me.  - What, and leave Hermione?

228
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:37,822
你疯了吗? 没有她我们两天都活不下去
You mad? We wouldn't last two days without her.

229
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:40,753
别告诉她是我说的
Don't tell her I said that.

230
00:24:42,332 --> 00:24:45,529
再说了 你身上的踪丝还没失效
Besides, you've still got the Trace on you.

231
00:24:45,702 --> 00:24:49,798
- 我们还要参加婚礼呢...  - 什么见鬼婚礼
- We've still got the wedding...  - I don't care about a wedding.

232
00:24:49,973 --> 00:24:54,842
对不起 无意冒犯 但是我们必须开始找魂器了
I'm sorry. No matter whose it is. I have to start finding these Horcruxes.

233
00:24:55,012 --> 00:24:56,980
那是我们唯一可以击倒他的方法...
They're our only chance to beat him...

234
00:24:57,147 --> 00:25:00,116
我们等得越久 他就越强大
and the longer we stay here, the stronger he gets.

235
00:25:01,551 --> 00:25:03,644
今晚不是时候 兄弟
Tonight's not the night, mate.

236
00:25:03,954 --> 00:25:06,422
就当让他多活两天吧
We'd only be doing him a favor.

237
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:36,118
你觉得他知道吗?
Do you think he knows?

238
00:25:36,853 --> 00:25:42,723
魂器 就是他一部分的灵魂 也就是他的一部分
I mean, they're bits of his soul, these Horcruxes. Bits of him.

239
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,726
当邓布利多摧毁了他的戒指 你毁掉了汤姆・里德尔的日记...
When Dumbledore destroyed the ring, you destroyed Tom Riddle's diary...

240
00:25:49,232 --> 00:25:51,826
他肯定察觉到了
he must have felt something.

241
00:25:52,602 --> 00:25:56,333
要毁灭其他魂器 我们必须先找到它们
To kill the other Horcruxes, we have to find them.

242
00:25:56,706 --> 00:25:58,674
它们在哪儿?
Where are they?

243
00:25:59,209 --> 00:26:01,268
我们从哪里开始?
Where do we start?

244
00:26:04,714 --> 00:26:05,806
准备好了吗
Ready when you are.

245
00:26:07,551 --> 00:26:11,851
注意点! 这是哥哥的婚礼 打起精神来
Please pay attention! It's your brother's wedding. Buck up.

246
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:17,280
邓布利多的黑暗秘密 丽塔・斯基特新书发布

247
00:26:29,272 --> 00:26:33,530
悼念邓布利多 埃菲亚斯・多吉

248
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,339
帮我拉一下拉链 好吗?
Zip me up, will you?

249
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:55,130
挺傻的 是吧 这婚礼?
It seems silly, doesn't it, a wedding?

250
00:26:55,632 --> 00:26:57,998
对将来的事视而不见
Given everything that's going on.

251
00:26:59,336 --> 00:27:01,395
也许这就是最好的理由...
Maybe that's the best reason to have it...

252
00:27:02,005 --> 00:27:04,530
该来的总会要来的
because of everything that's going on.

253
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,751
早上好
Morning.

254
00:27:32,936 --> 00:27:35,097
准备好 要升起来咯
Come on, keep up.

255
00:27:35,772 --> 00:27:37,433
大家一起来
All together now.

256
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:43,045
一 二 三
One, two, three.

257
00:27:53,123 --> 00:27:55,557
那边看起来怎么样 孩子们?
How's it looking at your end, boys?

258
00:27:56,193 --> 00:27:58,127
很不错
Brilliant.

259
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:05,065
见鬼 魔法部长来这里干什么?
Bloody hell. What's the Minister of Magic doing here?

260
00:28:10,974 --> 00:28:12,839
什么风把你吹来了 部长先生?
To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister?

261
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:17,571
我想我们彼此都很清楚为什么 波特先生
I think we both know the answer to that question, Mr. Potter.

262
00:28:25,255 --> 00:28:27,155
这个是...?
And this is...?

263
00:28:35,198 --> 00:28:39,100
"我将要呈上的是..."
"Herein is set forth the last will and testament...

264
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:43,865
阿不思・珀西瓦尔・伍尔弗里克・布赖恩・邓布利多的遗嘱以及遗物
of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.

265
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,500
首先 我留给罗纳德・比利尔斯・韦斯莱的...
First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley...

266
00:28:48,678 --> 00:28:51,977
是我的熄灯器...
I leave my Deluminator...

267
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:54,412
我亲手制作的...
a device of my own making...

268
00:28:54,584 --> 00:28:59,817
希望可以在最黑暗的时候...
in the hope that, when things seem most dark...

269
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:04,325
为他指明方向"
it will show him the light."

270
00:29:10,233 --> 00:29:13,327
- 邓布利多留给我的?  - 是的
- Dumbledore left this for me?  - Yeah.

271
00:29:14,271 --> 00:29:15,863
好棒啊
Brilliant.

272
00:29:16,906 --> 00:29:18,737
这有什么用?
What is it?

273
00:29:30,887 --> 00:29:32,479
真牛
Wicked.

274
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:37,760
"我留给赫敏・简・格兰杰...
"To Hermione Jean Granger...

275
00:29:37,927 --> 00:29:43,092
这本"诗翁彼豆故事集"...
I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard...

276
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:47,930
希望她在里面读到欢乐与启示"
in the hope that she find it entertaining and instructive."

277
00:29:48,738 --> 00:29:50,069
我妈妈以前常给我念这本书
Mom used to read me those.

278
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,464
"巫师与大礼帽"
"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot."

279
00:29:52,642 --> 00:29:55,577
"小兔芭比迪和咯咯笑树桩"
"Babbitty Rabbitty and the Cackling Stump."

280
00:29:57,347 --> 00:30:00,714
不是吧 小兔芭比迪
Come on, Babbitty Rabbitty.

281
00:30:01,184 --> 00:30:02,879
没听说过?
No?

282
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:06,017
"我留给哈利・詹姆・波特...
"To Harry James Potter...

283
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:10,287
他第一次在霍格沃茨魁地奇比赛上抓到的飞贼...
I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts...

284
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:15,488
希望他能记住通过坚毅与技巧...
as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance...

285
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:19,929
得来的一切"
and skill."

286
00:30:39,989 --> 00:30:43,049
- 就这个 没别的了?  - 那倒不是
- Is that it, then?  - Not quite.

287
00:30:43,226 --> 00:30:48,630
邓布利多还给你留了第二样东西:
Dumbledore left you a second bequest:

288
00:30:48,865 --> 00:30:51,857
戈德里克・格兰芬多之剑
The sword of Godric Gryffindor.

289
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:58,066
不幸的是 邓布利多没有权利将格兰芬多之剑送给他人
Unfortunately, the sword of Gryffindor was not Dumbledore's to give away.

290
00:30:58,475 --> 00:31:01,205
作为一件重要的历史文物 它属于...
As an important historical artifact, it belongs...

291
00:31:01,378 --> 00:31:02,470
属于哈利
To Harry.

292
00:31:03,313 --> 00:31:05,247
它是属于哈利的
It belongs to Harry.

293
00:31:05,415 --> 00:31:08,111
当哈利在密室里需要它的时候格兰芬多之剑就出现了
It came to him when he needed it in the Chamber of Secrets.

294
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:11,185
出色的格兰芬多巫师都可以召唤出宝剑
The sword may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor.

295
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:13,686
但不能说剑是他的私人物品
That does not make it that wizard's property.

296
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:18,754
而且 现在这把剑已经不知去向
And, in any event, the current whereabouts of the sword are unknown.

297
00:31:18,928 --> 00:31:21,522
- 什么?  - 那把剑失踪了
- Excuse me?  - The sword is missing.

298
00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:26,426
我不知道你想要干什么 波特先生...
I don't know what you're up to, Mr. Potter...

299
00:31:26,603 --> 00:31:30,562
但是你不能独自面对
but you can't fight this war on your own.

300
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,140
他太强大了
He's too strong.

301
00:32:34,337 --> 00:32:35,599
哈利
Hello, Harry.

302
00:32:36,506 --> 00:32:40,499
我是不是打扰到你了? 我从你眼中看到你在思考
I've interrupted a deep thought, haven't I? I can see it growing smaller in your eyes.

303
00:32:40,677 --> 00:32:42,201
当然没有 近来好吗 卢娜?
Of course not. How are you, Luna?

304
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:45,006
我很好 刚刚被一个地精咬了
Very well. Got bitten by a garden gnome only moments ago.

305
00:32:45,181 --> 00:32:47,513
地精口水对身体有好处
Gnome saliva is very beneficial.

306
00:32:47,684 --> 00:32:50,050
谢诺菲留斯・洛夫古德 我们就住在山那边
Xenophilius Lovegood. We live just over the hill.

307
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,414
很高兴认识你 先生
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

308
00:32:51,588 --> 00:32:54,352
相信你有所耳闻 波特先生 我们唱唱反调杂志...
I trust you know, Mr. Potter, that we at The Quibbler...

309
00:32:54,524 --> 00:32:56,856
不像那些预言家日报的马屁精...
unlike those toadies at The Daily Prophet...

310
00:32:57,026 --> 00:32:59,620
邓布利多在世时我们支持他...
fully supported Dumbledore in his lifetime...

311
00:32:59,796 --> 00:33:03,459
他死后 我们依然全力支持他
and, in his death, support you just as fully.

312
00:33:03,766 --> 00:33:05,131
谢谢你
Thank you.

313
00:33:05,301 --> 00:33:08,134
走了 爸爸 哈利现在不想和我们说话
Come, Daddy. Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now.

314
00:33:08,304 --> 00:33:10,602
他只是出于礼貌没有说而已
He's just too polite to say so.

315
00:33:10,773 --> 00:33:12,832
哈利・波特
Harry Potter.

316
00:33:16,379 --> 00:33:18,506
抱歉 先生? 我能坐这里吗?
Excuse me, sir? May I sit down?

317
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:22,082
哦 波特先生 当然可以 请坐
Mr. Potter. By all means. Here.

318
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:23,913
谢谢
Thanks.

319
00:33:26,623 --> 00:33:29,922
您在预言家日报的文章很感人
I found what you wrote in The Daily Prophet really moving.

320
00:33:30,493 --> 00:33:33,291
你一定和邓布利多是老相识了
You obviously knew Dumbledore well.

321
00:33:33,463 --> 00:33:36,398
的确 我和他算是认识时间最长的了
Well, I certainly knew him the longest.

322
00:33:36,566 --> 00:33:39,296
如果不算他的弟弟阿不福思的话...
That is, if you don't count his brother, Aberforth...

323
00:33:39,469 --> 00:33:42,495
当然 从来也没有人把阿不福思算进去
and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.

324
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:44,898
- 我不知道他还有一个弟弟  - 很正常
- I didn't even know he had a brother.  - Ah.

325
00:33:45,074 --> 00:33:48,635
邓布利多一直是一个很谨慎的人 从小就这样
Well, Dumbledore was always very private, even as a boy.

326
00:33:48,811 --> 00:33:50,210
别泄气 埃菲亚斯
Don't despair, Elphias.

327
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,817
我听说丽塔・斯基特把他的一切都公之于众了...
I'm told he's been thoroughly unriddled by Rita Skeeter...

328
00:33:54,984 --> 00:33:57,817
绝对不少于八百页
in 800 pages, no less.

329
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:02,857
据说有人找她聊过
Word has it that someone talked to her.

330
00:34:03,026 --> 00:34:05,824
一个对邓布利多一家很了解的人
Someone who knew the Dumbledore family well.

331
00:34:06,229 --> 00:34:09,824
你我心里都清楚这人是谁 埃菲亚斯
Both you and I know who that is, Elphias.

332
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:11,466
一个可怕的叛徒
A monstrous betrayal.

333
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:14,961
这是在说谁?
Who are we talking about?

334
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:18,566
巴希达・巴沙特
Bathilda Bagshot.

335
00:34:20,243 --> 00:34:21,301
- 谁?  - 天啊 孩子...
- Who?  - My God, boy...

336
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:26,244
她是上世纪最著名的魔法史学家
She's only the most celebrated magical historian of the last century.

337
00:34:27,951 --> 00:34:32,183
没有人比她和邓布利多一家关系更密切了
She was as close to the Dumbledores as anyone.

338
00:34:32,355 --> 00:34:37,383
丽塔・斯基特肯定不辞辛苦去了戈德里克山谷...
Oh, I'm sure Rita Skeeter thought it well worth a trip to Godric's Hollow...

339
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,757
就为了刺探他家的陈年往事
to take a peek into that old bird's rattled cage.

340
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,761
戈德里克山谷?
Godric's Hollow?

341
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,099
巴希达・巴沙特住在戈德里克山谷?
Bathilda Bagshot lives at Godric's Hollow?

342
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,594
那是她和邓布利多初遇的地方
Well, that's where she first met Dumbledore.

343
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,635
你是说邓布利多也住在那?
You don't mean to say he lived there too?

344
00:34:49,806 --> 00:34:53,367
在他父亲杀了那三个麻瓜之后 他们就举家搬去那了
The family moved there after his father killed those three Muggles.

345
00:34:53,543 --> 00:34:57,172
当时这桩丑闻闹得沸沸扬扬的
Oh, it was quite the scandal.

346
00:34:57,347 --> 00:35:02,182
老实说 孩子 你确定你真的了解他吗?
Honestly, my boy, are you sure you knew him at all?

347
00:35:28,645 --> 00:35:31,739
魔法部已被攻陷
The Ministry has fallen.

348
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:36,284
魔法部长也已死去
The Minister of Magic is dead.

349
00:35:38,755 --> 00:35:41,053
他们来了
They are coming.

350
00:35:41,224 --> 00:35:43,317
他们来了
They are coming.

351
00:35:44,594 --> 00:35:46,084
他们来了
They are coming.

352
00:35:46,262 --> 00:35:47,729
他们来了!
They're coming!

353
00:35:49,766 --> 00:35:51,597
很高兴认识你 波特先生
Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter.

354
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:05,045
- 金妮!  - 哈利! 走!
- Ginny!  - Harry! Go!

355
00:36:05,214 --> 00:36:06,272
离开这里!
Go!

356
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:22,189
市内观光团去不去? 十五分钟内就出发
Here you go, sightseeing tour? Leaves in 15 minutes.

357
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:26,261
- 我们在哪?  - 沙夫茨伯里大街(英国伦敦剧场集中的街区)
- Where are we?  - Shaftesbury Avenue.

358
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:29,633
我爸妈过去常带我来看戏
I used to come to the theater here with Mom and Dad.

359
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:33,033
不知道我为什么会想到这里 这地方突然就跳到我脑子里来了
I don't know why I thought of it. It just popped into my head.

360
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:35,274
这边
This way.

361
00:36:39,082 --> 00:36:41,175
我们得换一下衣服
We need to change.

362
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:48,385
这什么情况...?
How the ruddy...?

363
00:36:48,558 --> 00:36:51,118
无痕伸展咒
Undetectable Extension Charm.

364
00:36:51,561 --> 00:36:53,825
你简直太了不起了 真的
You're amazing, you are.

365
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,590
至于这么惊讶吗
Always the tone of surprise.

366
00:36:58,601 --> 00:37:00,728
啊 还好书也带了
Ah. That'll be the books.

367
00:37:06,242 --> 00:37:08,107
婚礼上其他人怎么办?
What about all the people at the wedding?

368
00:37:08,277 --> 00:37:10,745
- 我们是不是应该回去帮忙?  - 那些人是冲你来的
- Do you think we should go back?  - They were after you.

369
00:37:10,913 --> 00:37:13,074
我们回去会使大家陷入危险
We'd put everyone in danger by going back.

370
00:37:14,951 --> 00:37:16,680
- 罗恩是对的  - 喂
- Ron's right.  - Ahem.

371
00:37:16,853 --> 00:37:18,514
咖啡?
Coffee?

372
00:37:19,055 --> 00:37:22,081
- 一杯卡布奇诺 谢谢  - 你呢?
- A cappuccino, please.  - You?

373
00:37:22,925 --> 00:37:26,224
- 和她要一样的  - 我也是
- What she said.  - Same.

374
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,433
我们现在去哪? 破釜酒吧?
So where do we go from here? Leaky Cauldron?

375
00:37:33,803 --> 00:37:34,895
太危险了
It's too dangerous.

376
00:37:35,805 --> 00:37:39,332
如果伏地魔已经控制了魔法部 所有我们常去的地方都不安全
If Voldemort has taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe.

377
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:42,569
婚礼上所有人都会躲起来的
Everyone from the wedding will have gone underground, into hiding.

378
00:37:42,745 --> 00:37:45,236
我的包被我忘在陋居了 里面装着我所有的东西
My rucksack with all my things, I've left it at the Burrow.

379
00:37:50,386 --> 00:37:52,286
不是吧 都装进去了?
You're joking.

380
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:57,849
我花了好几天把所有必需品都装好了 以防万一
I've had all the essentials packed for days, just in case.

381
00:37:58,027 --> 00:38:00,222
顺便说一下 这些牛仔裤不是我最喜欢的
By the way, these jeans, not my favorite.

382
00:38:01,397 --> 00:38:02,455
趴下!
Down!

383
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,896
昏昏倒地!
Stupefy!

384
00:38:09,105 --> 00:38:10,834
飞沙走石!
Expulso!

385
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,581
统统石化
Petrificus Totalus.

386
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:27,780
快走
Go.

387
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:29,384
离开这里
Leave.

388
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:36,861
把门锁上 把灯灭掉
Lock the door, get the lights.

389
00:38:46,108 --> 00:38:47,837
他叫罗尔
This one's name is Rowle.

390
00:38:48,344 --> 00:38:51,780
斯内普在天文塔上杀死邓布利多那晚 他也在场
He was on the Astronomy Tower the night Snape killed Dumbledore.

391
00:38:52,582 --> 00:38:57,076
他是多洛霍夫 我曾见过通缉他的告示
This is Dolohov. I recognize him from the wanted posters.

392
00:38:58,154 --> 00:39:00,315
我们该怎么处置你呢?
So, what we gonna do with you, hey?

393
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,283
如果倒下的是我们 肯定被你杀了对吧?
Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn't you?

394
00:39:03,459 --> 00:39:04,790
如果我们杀了他们 大家都会知道我们曾在这出现
If we kill them, they'll know we were here.

395
00:39:04,961 --> 00:39:06,360
罗恩
Ron.

396
00:39:06,529 --> 00:39:10,488
如果是他杀了疯眼汉呢 你还会怜悯他吗?
Suppose he did Mad-Eye. How would you feel then?

397
00:39:12,468 --> 00:39:14,095
最好只抹去他们的记忆
It's better we wipe their memories.

398
00:39:14,971 --> 00:39:16,939
你说了算
You're the boss.

399
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,003
赫敏...
Hermione...

400
00:39:21,477 --> 00:39:23,945
还是你来吧
you're the best at spells.

401
00:39:41,597 --> 00:39:43,792
一忘皆空
Obliviate.

402
00:39:56,145 --> 00:39:57,737
他们是怎么知道我们在这?
How is it they knew we were there?

403
00:39:57,914 --> 00:39:59,506
你身上的踪丝还没解除?
Maybe you still have the Trace on you?

404
00:39:59,682 --> 00:40:03,118
不可能 踪丝17岁当天就解除了 巫师法规定的
Can't be. Trace breaks at 17. It's wizarding law.

405
00:40:04,921 --> 00:40:06,479
怎么了?
What?

406
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:10,259
我们还没给你庆祝生日呢 哈利
We didn't celebrate your birthday, Harry.

407
00:40:10,626 --> 00:40:13,891
金妮和我一起为你准备了个蛋糕
Ginny and I, we prepared a cake.

408
00:40:14,063 --> 00:40:17,032
我们本来打算在婚礼最后拿出来的
We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding.

409
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:20,635
你们这么贴心我很感激 不过想想咱们在几分钟前差点
I appreciate the thought, but given the fact that we were almost killed...

410
00:40:20,803 --> 00:40:23,203
被两个食死徒杀了...
by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago...

411
00:40:24,874 --> 00:40:26,569
对哦
Right.

412
00:40:27,376 --> 00:40:28,400
说得也是
Perspective.

413
00:40:28,577 --> 00:40:31,569
街上人多眼杂的 我们得去个安全的地方
We need to get off the streets, get somewhere safe.

414
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,705
这究竟是干什么用的?
What was that all about?

415
00:41:07,683 --> 00:41:13,519
估计是疯眼汉的主意 以防斯内普来偷窥
Probably Mad-Eye's idea, in case Snape decided to come snooping.

416
00:41:21,697 --> 00:41:23,665
从形显身
Homenum Revelio.

417
00:41:30,306 --> 00:41:32,137
这儿没别人了
We're alone.

418
00:41:38,948 --> 00:41:41,178
我以为另一只魔杖...
I believed another wand...

419
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:43,818
- 你骗我  - 我怎么敢骗您
- You lied to me.  - It makes no sense.

420
00:41:46,655 --> 00:41:49,624
我以为再换一根魔杖就会有用 我发誓
I believed a different wand would work, I swear.

421
00:41:51,127 --> 00:41:53,186
肯定还有别的方法
There must be another way.

422
00:42:32,022 --> 00:42:39,433
小天狼星

423
00:42:58,127 --> 00:43:01,186

425
00:43:03,532 --> 00:43:07,263
哈利? 赫敏 你们在哪?
Harry? Hermione, where are you?

426
00:43:07,536 --> 00:43:09,868
我觉得我发现了一些东西
I think I've found something.

427
00:43:16,178 --> 00:43:17,236
这没什么啊
Lovely.

428
00:43:22,918 --> 00:43:26,410
"雷古勒斯・阿克图勒斯・布莱克"
"Regulus Arcturus Black."

429
00:43:26,589 --> 00:43:28,284
他就是R.A.B
R.A.B.

430
00:43:31,894 --> 00:43:35,193
"在你读到这之前我早就死了
"I know I will be dead long before you read this.

431
00:43:35,364 --> 00:43:39,391
我偷走了真正的魂器 并打算尽快销毁它"
I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it."

432
00:43:39,768 --> 00:43:42,168
R.A.B是小天狼星的弟弟?
R.A.B. is Sirius's brother?

433
00:43:42,605 --> 00:43:44,368
是的
Yes.

434
00:43:46,475 --> 00:43:50,343
问题是 他是否真的毁掉了真正的魂器?
Question is, did he actually destroy the real Horcrux?

435
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:14,228
你一直在暗中监视我们 对吧?
You've been spying on us, have you?

436
00:44:14,403 --> 00:44:18,863
克利切只是一直看着罢了
Kreacher has been watching.

437
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:20,975
或许他知道真正的挂坠盒在哪
Maybe he knows where the real locket is.

438
00:44:23,979 --> 00:44:25,913
你以前见过这个吗?
Have you ever seen this before?

439
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:27,673
克利切?
Kreacher?

440
00:44:28,517 --> 00:44:30,951
这是雷古拉斯主人的挂坠盒
It's Master Regulus' locket.

441
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,816
但这个挂坠盒有两个 对吗?
But there were two, weren't there?

442
00:44:34,823 --> 00:44:36,518
另一个在哪?
Where's the other one?

443
00:44:39,028 --> 00:44:43,590
克利切不知道另一个挂坠盒在哪
Kreacher doesn't know where the other locket is.

444
00:44:43,766 --> 00:44:46,166
没关系 但你有没有见过它? 它是否曾在这栋房子里?
Yes, but did you ever see it? Was it in this house?

445
00:44:46,335 --> 00:44:47,495
肮脏的泥巴种
Filthy Mudblood.

446

- 食死徒会来...  - 罗恩

它是曾在这栋房子里
It was here in this house.

450

一个邪恶至极的玩意
A most evil object.

451
00:45:04,653 --> 00:45:05,881
什么意思?
How do you mean?

452
00:45:06,655 --> 00:45:10,955
在雷古勒斯主人死前 他曾命令克利切毁了它...
Before Master Regulus died, he ordered Kreacher to destroy it...

453
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:16,393
但无论克利切如何努力 就是做不到
but no matter how hard Kreacher tried, he could not do it.

454
00:45:16,565 --> 00:45:18,157
那东西现在在哪?
Well, where is it now?

455
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:23,397
- 有人把它拿走了吗?  - 那个人有天晚上来到这
- Did someone take it?  - He came in the night.

456
00:45:23,572 --> 00:45:28,236
他拿走了很多东西 包括挂坠盒
He took many things, including the locket.

457
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:29,934
谁?
Who did?

458
00:45:30,613 --> 00:45:32,205
那个人是谁 克利切?
Who was it, Kreacher?

463
00:46:05,281 --> 00:46:06,748
我父亲会强烈谴责这种行为的
My father will hear about this.

464
00:46:12,054 --> 00:46:13,919
喂 笨蛋
Hey, losers.

465
00:46:14,657 --> 00:46:16,921
他不在这
He isn't here.

466

头号不良分子 哈利・波特

467
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:32,939
作为你们新的魔法部长...

468
00:46:33,142 --> 00:46:38,307
我保证会恢复这座宽容之殿...

昔日的光彩

00:46:51,994 --> 00:46:54,986
如果你没有什么需要隐瞒...
You have nothing to fear...

475
00:46:56,432 --> 00:46:58,161
就没有什么需要害怕
if you have nothing to hide.

476
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:04,163
- 多少钱?  - 两个金加隆
- How much?  - Two Galleons.

477
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,831
快点 时间就是金钱 再见 伙计
Come on, time is money. Cheers, pal.

当斯克林杰给你的时候 我以为你一碰它就会打开
When Scrimgeour first gave it to you, I thought it might open at your touch.

露出邓布利多藏在里面的东西

487
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,174
为什么伏地魔还未证明他已经...

488
00:48:13,342 --> 00:48:16,402
挫败他和他的追随者最大的绊脚石

- Expelliarmus.  - Mundungus Fletcher.

494

你搞什么鬼? 派两只该死的家养小精灵来抓我
What you playing at? Setting a pair of bleeding house-elves after me.

495
00:48:39,468 --> 00:48:40,958
多比只是想帮忙
Dobby was only trying to help.

Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley, which Dobby thought was curious.

我是个奇珍异宝供应商
I'm a purveyor of rare and wondrous objects.

你是个小偷 顿格 大家都知道
You're a thief, Dung. Everyone knows it.

韦斯莱主人 很高兴再见到你
Master Weasley, so good to see you again.

505
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,764
听着 我那晚吓坏了好嘛?
Listen, I panicked that night, all right?

506
00:49:16,405 --> 00:49:18,635
疯眼汉掉下扫帚我能有什么办法?
Could I help it if Mad-Eye fell off his broom?

507
00:49:20,642 --> 00:49:22,075
- 你...  - 说实话
- You....  - Tell the truth.

508
00:49:22,244 --> 00:49:25,008
你洗劫这里的时候... 别抵赖
When you turned this place over... Don't deny it.

509
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,704
你发现了一个挂坠盒 我说得没错吧?
you found a locket, am I right?

510
00:49:26,882 --> 00:49:29,146
怎么了? 很值钱吗?
Why? Was it valuable?

511
00:49:29,318 --> 00:49:30,444
还在你手上?
You still got it?

512
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:33,053
不在了 他就是担心他卖的价钱不够高
No, he's worried he didn't get enough money for it.

513
00:49:33,222 --> 00:49:34,746
是直接送给人家了
Bleeding give it away, didn't I?

514
00:49:36,124 --> 00:49:39,252
我当时在对角巷做生意...
There I was, flogging me wares in Diagon Alley...

515
00:49:39,428 --> 00:49:43,387
一个魔法部的老巫婆跑来问我要执照
when some Ministry hag comes up and asks to see me license.

516
00:49:43,632 --> 00:49:45,691
她说她要把我关进大牢
Says she's a mind to lock me up.

517
00:49:45,868 --> 00:49:49,531
为了免牢狱之灾 我就把那个挂坠盒送给她了
And would've done it too, if she hadn't taken a fancy to that locket.

518
00:49:49,705 --> 00:49:53,641
- 那个女巫 你知道她是谁吗?  - 不知道 我...
- Who was she? The witch. Do you know?  - No, I...

519
00:49:58,447 --> 00:50:01,848
这就是她 瞧啊
Well, she's there. Look.

520
00:50:03,986 --> 00:50:06,352
真是得来全不费工夫
Bleeding bow and all.

521
00:50:47,195 --> 00:50:50,961
好了 记住我们说过的
Right, remember what we said.

522
00:50:51,233 --> 00:50:54,964
除非万不得已 不要跟别人交谈
Don't speak to anyone unless absolutely necessary.

523
00:50:55,237 --> 00:51:00,140
保持正常举止 别人做什么我们就跟着做什么
Just try and act normal. Do what everybody else is doing.

524
00:51:00,576 --> 00:51:03,704
如果我们这么做 幸运的话 我们就可以混进去
If we do that, then with a bit of luck, we'll get inside.

525
00:51:03,879 --> 00:51:05,471
- 然后...  - 就会变非常棘手
- And then...  - It gets really tricky.

526
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:07,512
- 正确  - 是啊
- Correct.  - Yeah.

527
00:51:07,683 --> 00:51:10,584
- 这简直太疯狂了  - 是啊
- This is completely mental.  - Completely.

528
00:51:10,752 --> 00:51:12,777
这个世界已经疯了
The world's mental.

529
00:51:12,955 --> 00:51:14,388
来吧...
Come on...

530
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,424
我们还有个魂器要找呢
we've got a Horcrux to find.

531
00:51:40,061 --> 00:51:43,242
男厕

532
00:52:11,313 --> 00:52:13,713
得把自己冲到下水道里
We flush ourselves in.

533
00:52:17,753 --> 00:52:20,517
这也太恶心了
That's bloody disgusting.

534
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:50,211
姓名?
Name?

535
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,044
你 来一下
You. Come.

536
00:52:53,221 --> 00:52:55,382
- 什么?  - 来一下
- What? What?  - Come on.

537
00:52:55,557 --> 00:52:57,991
- 我怎么了?  - 往前走

Gotta tell you, I'm starting to freak out a bit.

How long did you say this batch of Polyjuice would last, Hermione?

542

你应该已经看出来我这是要下楼了吧 卡特莫尔?
You do realize I'm going downstairs, don't you, Cattermole?

之前与唐克斯和克利斯维尔以及格纳克同行的...
It is believed that Muggle-born Dean Thomas and a second goblin...

673
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:32,665
麻瓜出身的迪安・托马斯和另一个妖精...
both believed to have been traveling with Tonks, Cresswell...

674
01:07:32,833 --> 01:07:34,357
据信已经逃脱
and Gornuk, may have escaped.

675
01:07:34,535 --> 01:07:38,301
如果迪安在收听或者任何人知道他的下落...
If Dean is listening or anyone has any knowledge of his whereabouts...

676
01:07:38,472 --> 01:07:41,532
他的父母和姐妹急切盼望他的消息
his parents and sisters are desperate for news.

677
01:07:41,709 --> 01:07:45,076
与此同时 一个麻瓜五口之家惨遭灭门
Meanwhile, a Muggle family of five has been found dead in their home.

678
01:07:45,246 --> 01:07:48,511
你知道那咒语的 哈利
You know the spell, Harry.

679
01:07:52,253 --> 01:07:53,515
告诉我
Tell me.

680
01:07:56,157 --> 01:07:57,988
告诉我 格里戈维奇
Tell me, Gregorovitch.

681
01:07:58,159 --> 01:07:59,786
它被偷走了
It was stolen from me.

682
01:07:59,961 --> 01:08:03,419
是谁? 谁偷的?
Who was he? The thief?

683
01:08:06,567 --> 01:08:10,526
是个男孩 是他偷的
It was a boy. It was he who took it.

684
01:08:10,905 --> 01:08:13,203
我再也没有见过它了
I never saw it again.

685
01:08:13,374 --> 01:08:15,171
我以性命担保
I swear on my life.

686
01:08:16,043 --> 01:08:17,203
我相信你
I believe you.

687
01:08:23,217 --> 01:08:24,946
阿瓦达索命!
Avada Kedavra!

688
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,090
我以为已经停止了
I thought it had stopped.

689
01:08:43,004 --> 01:08:45,438
你不能再让他进入你思想了 哈利
You can't keep letting him in, Harry.

690
01:08:47,508 --> 01:08:50,443
神秘人找到了格里戈维奇
You-Know-Who has found Gregorovitch.

691
01:08:50,745 --> 01:08:52,303
魔杖制作人?
The wandmaker?

692
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:57,008
他想要一样格里戈维奇曾经拥有的东西...
He wants something that Gregorovitch used to have...

693
01:08:57,184 --> 01:08:58,651
但我不知道是什么
but I don't know what.

694
01:08:58,819 --> 01:09:04,815
但他急切地想找到它 我是说 就像生死攸关一样
But he wants it desperately. I mean, it's as if his life depends on it.

695
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,884
别管他
Don't.

696
01:09:08,062 --> 01:09:10,257
- 那使他感到安慰  - 广播让我很难受
- It comforts him.  - It sets my teeth on edge.

697
01:09:10,431 --> 01:09:12,661
他期望听到什么 好消息吗?
What's he expecting to hear, good news?

698
01:09:12,833 --> 01:09:15,700
长久期待的那样 魔法部的垮台令人震惊
who long expected it, the fall of the Ministry was shocking.

699
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:18,236
我想他只是希望没有坏消息
I think he just hopes he doesn't hear bad news.

700
01:09:18,406 --> 01:09:20,340
我们保证继续充当您的耳目...
We promise to remain your eyes and ears...

701
01:09:20,508 --> 01:09:21,941
他还有多久才能走动?
How long before he can travel?

702
01:09:22,109 --> 01:09:25,306
力所能及地为您提供消息
Bringing you news when we can, from wherever we can.

703
01:09:25,479 --> 01:09:26,776
我已经竭尽所能了
I'm doing everything I can.

704
01:09:26,947 --> 01:09:28,471
你做的还不够!
You're not doing enough!

705
01:09:31,218 --> 01:09:33,243
摘掉它
Take it off.

706
01:09:34,021 --> 01:09:36,581
我说了 现在就摘掉
I said, take it off now.

707
01:09:47,601 --> 01:09:50,331
- 好些了?  - 好多了
- Better?  - Loads.

708
01:09:54,041 --> 01:09:56,305
我们轮流戴 好吗?
We'll take it in turns, okay?

709
01:10:25,372 --> 01:10:28,739
芬奇承认他的发明最近出现了纰漏
Finch does admit his invention currently has one short.

710
01:10:28,909 --> 01:10:30,376
现在 其他消息:
And now, other news:

711
01:10:30,544 --> 01:10:33,809
西弗勒斯・斯内普 新任霍格沃茨校长...
Severus Snape, newly-appointed headmaster of Hogwarts...

712
01:10:33,981 --> 01:10:37,747
宣布所有的学生必须遵守新校规
has decreed that all students must conform to the latest house rules.

713
01:11:05,379 --> 01:11:09,816
霍格沃茨与邓布利多领导下的状况相去甚远
Hogwarts bears little resemblance to the school under Dumbledore's leadership.

714
01:11:09,984 --> 01:11:13,613
斯内普的体制非常严厉 反映了黑魔头的心意...
Snape's curriculum is severe, reflecting the wishes of the Dark Lord...

715
01:11:14,455 --> 01:11:19,392
任何违规行为均由两位食死徒负责严加惩处
and infractions are dealt with harshly by the two Death Eaters on staff.

716
01:11:38,879 --> 01:11:40,210
什么东西?
What's that?

717
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:52,254
这什么味道?
What's that smell?

718
01:12:14,715 --> 01:12:16,740
- 你干嘛呢?  - 很重啊
- What you doing?  - It's heavy.

719
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:18,509
要不我来帮你扛好了?
Oh, sorry. Do you want me to carry it?

720
01:12:18,686 --> 01:12:21,621
- 好啊 谢谢  - 别逗了 抬起来
- Yeah, thank you.  - Don't be ridiculous. Pick it up.

721
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:24,214
傻蛋
Numpty.

722
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:31,321
搜捕队
Snatchers.

723
01:12:32,366 --> 01:12:34,800
幸好你的魔咒有用
Good to know your enchantments work.

724
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,469
他能闻到我的香水味
He could smell it. My perfume.

725
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:47,738
我告诉过你了...
I've told you...

726
01:12:48,215 --> 01:12:50,046
罗恩还不适合幻影显形
Ron isn't strong enough to Apparate.

727
01:12:50,217 --> 01:12:53,948
好吧 那就只能步行了
Well, then, we'll go on foot.

728
01:12:54,755 --> 01:12:59,692
还有赫敏 虽然我喜欢你的香水味 但还是别喷了
And next time, Hermione, as much as I like your perfume, just don't wear any.

729
01:13:04,598 --> 01:13:08,466
现在广播失踪的巫师们
And now for the names of missing witches and wizards.

730
01:13:09,336 --> 01:13:11,497
这些是已确认的

731
01:13:12,339 --> 01:13:15,706

He doesn't know what he's doing, does he?

746
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:05,390
谁也不知道
None of us do.

754
01:14:46,821 --> 01:14:48,448
怎么了?
What?

755
01:14:49,023 --> 01:14:51,048
我一会儿告诉你
I'll tell you in a minute.

756
01:14:51,592 --> 01:14:54,288
现在就告诉我吧
Maybe you could tell me now.

757
01:14:54,662 --> 01:14:57,688
格兰芬多之剑 是妖精所制
The sword of Gryffindor, it's goblin-made.

758
01:14:57,865 --> 01:14:58,957
这谁都知道
Brilliant.

759
01:15:00,034 --> 01:15:02,434
不 你没明白
No, you don't understand.

760
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:05,136
灰尘和铁锈对剑没有影响
Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade.

761
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:09,507
它只吸收使之强大之物
It only takes in that which makes it stronger.

762
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:11,275
所以呢
Okay.

763
01:15:11,445 --> 01:15:14,937
哈利 你已经销毁了一个魂器了 对吧?
Harry, you've already destroyed one Horcrux, right?

764
01:15:15,116 --> 01:15:17,380
密室里汤姆・里德尔的日记本
Tom Riddle's diary in the Chamber of Secrets.

765
01:15:17,551 --> 01:15:20,452
用的是蛇怪的毒牙 如果你告诉我...
With a Basilisk fang. If you tell me you've got one of those...

766
01:15:20,621 --> 01:15:24,079
- 你那破珠绣包里有一颗...  - 你还不懂吗?
- in that bloody beaded bag of yours...  - Don't you see?

767
01:15:24,258 --> 01:15:27,989
在密室里 你用格兰芬多剑刺中了蛇怪
In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed the Basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor.

768
01:15:28,162 --> 01:15:31,689
它的剑刃上浸着蛇怪的毒液
Its blade is impregnated with Basilisk venom.

769
01:15:31,866 --> 01:15:33,959
它只吸收使之强大之物
It only takes in that which makes it stronger.

770
01:15:34,135 --> 01:15:37,298
- 正是 所以...  - 它可以销毁魂器
- Exactly, which is why...  - It can destroy Horcruxes.

771
01:15:37,471 --> 01:15:39,735
所以邓布利多才在遗嘱里遗赠给你
That's why Dumbledore left it to you in his will.

772
01:15:39,907 --> 01:15:44,310
你太天才了 赫敏 真的
You are brilliant, Hermione. Truly.

773
01:15:44,478 --> 01:15:48,539
其实 我只是逻辑性强 所以我才能回顾看似无关的细节...
Actually, I'm highly logical, which allows me to look past extraneous detail...

774
01:15:48,716 --> 01:15:51,207
并看出其他人忽略的信息
and perceive clearly that which others overlook.

775
01:15:51,385 --> 01:15:54,081
- 是啊  - 当然 还有一个问题
- Yeah  - There's only one problem, of course.

776
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:01,587
剑不见了
The sword was stolen.

777
01:16:02,997 --> 01:16:05,522
不好意思 还有个我呢
Yeah, I'm still here.

778
01:16:06,033 --> 01:16:10,163
二位请继续 别让我搅了兴致
But you two carry on. Don't let me spoil the fun.

779
01:16:11,539 --> 01:16:15,532
- 出了什么问题?  - 问题? 没有问题
- What's wrong?  - Wrong? Nothing's wrong.

780
01:16:15,709 --> 01:16:17,609
至少在你看来没有
Not according to you, anyway.

781
01:16:17,778 --> 01:16:21,407
听着 别阴阳怪气的 有话就说
Look, if you've got something to say, don't be shy. Spit it out.

782
01:16:21,782 --> 01:16:25,081
好 那我就说了 别指望我会兴高采烈...
All right, I'll spit it out. But don't expect me to be grateful...

783
01:16:25,252 --> 01:16:27,777
不就是又多了一件该死的东西要找
because there's another damn thing we've gotta find.

784
01:16:27,955 --> 01:16:30,219
我以为你知道参加的是什么行动
I thought you knew what you signed up for.

785
01:16:30,724 --> 01:16:32,589
是啊 我也以为我知道
Yeah. I thought I did too.

786
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,786
那好 恕我愚钝 但我不明白您的意思
Well then, I'm sorry, but I don't quite understand.

787
01:16:35,963 --> 01:16:39,421
哪个部分没有符合你的期望呢?
What part of this isn't living up to your expectations?

788
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,864
你以为我们会住在五星级饭店里?
Did you think we were gonna be staying in a five-star hotel?

789
01:16:42,036 --> 01:16:45,301
隔一天就能找到一个魂器? 以为圣诞节就能回家?
Finding a Horcrux every other day? You thought you'd be back by Christmas?

790
01:16:45,472 --> 01:16:47,303
我只是以为 这么长时间了...
I just thought, after all this time...

791
01:16:47,474 --> 01:16:50,910
我们能取得些成果 我以为你知道自己在做什么
we would've achieved something. I thought you knew what you were doing.

792
01:16:51,078 --> 01:16:53,478
我以为邓布利多告诉过你要干什么
I thought Dumbledore told you something worthwhile.

793
01:16:53,647 --> 01:16:56,844
- 我以为你有一个真正的计划  - 邓布利多说过的我都告诉你了
- I thought you had a plan.  - I told you everything Dumbledore told me.

794
01:16:57,017 --> 01:16:59,212
而且别忘了 我们找到了一个魂器
In case you haven't noticed, we found a Horcrux.

795
01:16:59,386 --> 01:17:03,254
是啊 毁灭它就跟找到剩下的魂器一样容易呢 对吧?
Yeah, and we're as close to getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them, aren't we?

796
01:17:03,424 --> 01:17:06,018
罗恩 拜托 摘下...
Ron. Please, take...

797
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,960
摘下魂器 你戴了它一整天了...
Please take the Horcrux off. You wouldn't be saying this...

798
01:17:09,129 --> 01:17:10,460
否则你不会说这种话的
if you hadn't been wearing it all day.

799
01:17:10,631 --> 01:17:13,031
知道我每晚听广播的原因吗?
Do you know why I listen to that radio every night, dear?

800
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:17,864
确保我没有听到金妮的名字 或者弗雷德 乔治还有妈妈
To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name, or Fred, or George or Mom.

801
01:17:18,038 --> 01:17:21,201
你以为我没在听吗? 你以为我不知道这种感觉吗?!
You think I'm not listening too? You think I don't know how this feels?!

802
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:22,842
是 你不知道这种感觉!
No, you don't know how it feels!

803
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:25,376
你的父母死了 你没有家庭
Your parents are dead. You have no family.

804
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,210
- 住手 住手  - 好啊 那就走吧!
- Stop. Stop.  - Fine, then go!

805
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:31,210
走啊!
Go, then!

806
01:17:34,121 --> 01:17:35,145
走啊
Fine.

807
01:17:38,292 --> 01:17:39,953
罗恩
Ron.

808
01:17:43,197 --> 01:17:44,994
你呢?
And you?

809
01:17:46,734 --> 01:17:49,259
跟我走还是留下来?
Are you coming or you staying?

810
01:17:56,377 --> 01:17:59,437
很好 我懂了
Fine. I get it.

811
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,048
那天晚上我都看见了
I saw you two the other night.

812
01:18:02,449 --> 01:18:04,883
罗恩 那是... 你误会了
Ron, that's... that's nothing.

813
01:18:07,021 --> 01:18:08,386
罗恩...
Ron...

814
01:18:11,592 --> 01:18:13,924
罗恩 你去哪?
Ron, where are you going?

815
01:18:14,928 --> 01:18:17,158
求你了 回来
Please, come back.

816
01:18:18,632 --> 01:18:20,327
罗恩
Ron.

817
01:18:25,039 --> 01:18:26,063
罗恩!
Ron!

818
01:19:28,369 --> 01:19:30,997
平安镇守
Salvio Hexia.

819
01:19:34,475 --> 01:19:36,909
驱逐麻瓜
Repellum Muggletum.

820
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:42,414
平安镇守
Salvio Hexia.

821
01:20:03,737 --> 01:20:06,399
# 可怜的老吉姆 面色苍白如同幽灵 #
# Poor old Jim's white as a ghost #

822
01:20:07,207 --> 01:20:10,404
# 他找到了 我们遗失的答案 #
# He's found the answer that we lost #

823
01:20:10,811 --> 01:20:14,247
# 我们抱头啜泣 泪如雨下 #
# We're all weeping now, weeping because #

824
01:20:14,815 --> 01:20:20,378
# 因为无论如何努力 都无法保护你 #
# there ain't nothing we can do to protect you #

825
01:20:20,754 --> 01:20:24,246
# 哦 孩子 #
# Oh, children #

826
01:20:28,195 --> 01:20:31,926
# 请大声疾呼 #
# Lift up your voice #

827
01:20:32,099 --> 01:20:37,594
# 请高声呐喊 #
# Lift up your voice #

828
01:20:37,771 --> 01:20:40,001
# 孩子啊 #
# Children #

829
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:49,444
# 请尽情欢乐 #
# Rejoice, rejoice #

830
01:20:49,616 --> 01:20:53,017
# 嗨 小火车啊 我们跳上的小火车 #
# Hey, little train, we're jumping on #

831
01:20:53,187 --> 01:20:56,918
# 它将行驶在那天国之路 #
# The train that goes to the kingdom #

832
01:20:57,458 --> 01:21:00,621
# 我们很幸福 妈妈 我们很开心 #
# We're happy, Ma, we're having fun #

833
01:21:00,794 --> 01:21:04,924
# 哪怕这火车尚未离站 #
# And the train ain't even left the station #

834
01:21:05,098 --> 01:21:08,465
# 嗨 小火车啊 等等我 #
# Hey, little train, wait for me #

835
01:21:08,669 --> 01:21:12,503
# 我曾如此盲目 但如今我已明了 #
# I once was blind but now I see #

836
01:21:12,673 --> 01:21:16,006
# 你是否还为我留有一隅? #
# Have you left a seat for me? #

837
01:21:16,176 --> 01:21:20,306
# 这是否是我想入非非? #
# Is that such a stretch of the imagination? #

838
01:21:20,481 --> 01:21:23,814
# 嗨 小火车啊 等等我 #
# Hey, little train, wait for me #

839
01:21:23,984 --> 01:21:27,852
# 我曾被束缚 但如今又是自由之身 #
# I was held in chains but now I'm free #

840
01:21:28,155 --> 01:21:31,056
# 我依然坚守 你可曾看见? #
# I'm hanging in there. Don't you see? #

841
01:21:31,225 --> 01:21:35,685
# 在这历尽考验的旅程中 #
# In this process of elimination #

842
01:21:35,863 --> 01:21:38,991
# 嗨 小火车啊 我们跳上的小火车 #
# Hey, little train, we're jumping on #

843
01:21:39,233 --> 01:21:42,691
# 它将行驶在那天国之路 #
# The train that goes to the kingdom #

844
01:21:43,303 --> 01:21:46,602
# 我们很幸福 妈妈 我们很开心 #
# We're happy, Ma, we're having fun #

845
01:21:46,773 --> 01:21:50,675
# 这超越我最狂野的渴望 #
# It's beyond my wildest expectation #

846
01:21:50,844 --> 01:21:54,075
# 嗨 小火车啊 我们跳上的小火车 #
# Hey, little train, we're jumping on #

847
01:21:54,248 --> 01:21:57,877
# 它将行驶在那天国之路 #
# The train that goes to the kingdom #

848
01:21:58,418 --> 01:22:01,615
# 我们很幸福 妈妈 我们很开心 #
# We're happy, Ma, we're having fun #

849
01:22:01,788 --> 01:22:06,657
# 哪怕这火车尚未离站 #
# The train ain't even left the station #

850
01:22:48,988 --> 01:22:51,957
我在结束之时开启

851
01:22:53,373 --> 01:22:54,863
赫敏
Hermione.

852
01:22:55,042 --> 01:22:57,374
赫敏? 你是对的
Hermione? You were right.

853
01:22:57,544 --> 01:22:59,102
金色飞贼有肉体记忆...
Snitches have flesh memories...

854
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:03,909
但这个飞贼不是我用手抓住的 我差点吞了它
but I didn't catch the first Snitch with my hand, I almost swallowed it.

855
01:23:09,189 --> 01:23:11,953
- "我在结束之时开启"  - 你觉得这什么意思?
- "I open at the close."  - What do you think that means?

856
01:23:12,125 --> 01:23:13,524
我不知道
I don't know.

857
01:23:15,929 --> 01:23:18,329
我也有发现
I found something as well.

858
01:23:24,705 --> 01:23:28,163
一开始我以为这是一只眼睛 但我现在不这么想了
At first I thought it was an eye, but now I don't think it is.

859
01:23:28,342 --> 01:23:32,506
这不是如尼文 它也不在"魔法字音表"里
It isn't a rune, and it isn't anywhere in Spellman's Syllabary.

860
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:36,074
某人用墨水写的 它不是书里的 有人画上去的
Somebody inked it in. It isn't part of the book. Somebody drew it.

861
01:23:36,249 --> 01:23:39,912
卢娜的爸爸在比尔和芙蓉的婚礼上戴着这个标志
Luna's dad was wearing that at Bill and Fleur's wedding.

862
01:23:42,656 --> 01:23:45,955
为什么把它画在一本儿童书里?
Why would someone draw it in a children's book?

863
01:23:48,562 --> 01:23:50,996
听着 赫敏 我一直在考虑
Look, Hermione, I've been thinking.

864
01:23:51,565 --> 01:23:53,658
我想去戈德里克山谷
I want to go to Godric's Hollow.

865
01:23:53,834 --> 01:23:56,894
那是我出生的地方 也是我父母死亡的地方
It's where I was born. It's where my parents died.

866
01:23:57,070 --> 01:24:00,665
正因为它对你意义重大 所以他肯定期待你去那里
That's exactly where he'll expect you to go because it means something to you.

867
01:24:00,841 --> 01:24:03,275
没错 但那里对他也有特殊意义 赫敏
Yeah, but it means something to him too, Hermione.

868
01:24:03,443 --> 01:24:05,434
神秘人差点死在那儿
You-Know-Who almost died there.

869
01:24:05,612 --> 01:24:10,276
我是说 那不正是他可能藏魂器的理想之地吗?
I mean, isn't that exactly the type of place he'd be likely to hide a Horcrux?

870
01:24:11,251 --> 01:24:13,811
太危险了 哈利
It's dangerous, Harry.

871
01:24:15,422 --> 01:24:19,415
但我不得不承认 我也一直想着我们必须得去
But even I have to admit, recently I've been thinking we'll have to go there.

872
01:24:19,593 --> 01:24:22,027
我觉得可能有其他东西藏匿于此
I think it's possible something else is hidden there.

873
01:24:22,195 --> 01:24:23,719
什么?
What?

874
01:24:24,431 --> 01:24:26,126
那把剑
The sword.

875
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:30,500
如果邓布利多希望你找到它 但又不想它落入魔法部之手...
If Dumbledore wanted you to find it, but didn't want it in the Ministry's hands...

876
01:24:30,671 --> 01:24:34,869
还有哪里比格兰芬多创建人出生地更合适的呢?
where better to hide it than the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor?

877
01:24:36,209 --> 01:24:38,074
赫敏...
Hermione....

878
01:24:43,316 --> 01:24:46,046
别再让我给你剪头发了
Don't ever let me give you a haircut again.

879
01:25:07,307 --> 01:25:09,969
我仍然觉得应该用复方汤剂的
I still think we should've used Polyjuice Potion.

880
01:25:10,143 --> 01:25:11,667
不
No.

881
01:25:12,345 --> 01:25:14,540
这是我出生的地方
This is where I was born.

882
01:25:14,881 --> 01:25:17,281
我不想以别人的身份回来
I'm not returning as someone else.

883
01:25:27,094 --> 01:25:30,086
晚安 哈哈哈
Good night. Ha-ha-ha.

884
01:25:33,133 --> 01:25:35,897
哈利 我想今天是平安夜
Harry, I think it's Christmas Eve.

885
01:25:37,404 --> 01:25:38,701
你听
Listen.

886
01:25:44,411 --> 01:25:47,244
你觉得他们也葬在这里吗 赫敏?
Do you think they'd be in there, Hermione?

887
01:25:47,681 --> 01:25:49,672
我的父母
My mom and dad.

888
01:25:55,622 --> 01:25:57,886
嗯 我觉得在
Yeah, I think they would.

889
01:26:34,461 --> 01:26:37,521
"伊格诺图斯・佩弗利尔"
"Ignotus Peverell."

890
01:26:39,599 --> 01:26:41,226
嘿 哈利?
Hey, Harry?

891
01:26:48,299 --> 01:26:50,226
詹姆・波特 莉莉・波特

892
01:27:19,105 --> 01:27:21,300
圣诞快乐 赫敏
Merry Christmas, Hermione.

893
01:27:22,609 --> 01:27:24,839
圣诞快乐 哈利
Merry Christmas, Harry.

894
01:27:44,698 --> 01:27:50,102
哈利 有人在看我们 教堂那边
Harry, there's someone watching us. By the church.

895
01:28:00,814 --> 01:28:02,645
我想我知道那是谁
I think I know who that is.

896
01:28:04,517 --> 01:28:05,950
我不喜欢这样 哈利
I don't like this, Harry.

897
01:28:06,119 --> 01:28:11,147
赫敏 她认识邓布利多 剑可能在她那儿
Hermione, she knew Dumbledore. She might have the sword.

898
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:31,637
这是他们被害的地方 赫敏
This is where they died, Hermione.

899
01:28:39,219 --> 01:28:41,687
他杀害他们的地方
This is where he murdered them.

900
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,134
你是巴希达 对吗?
You're Bathilda, aren't you?

901
01:29:01,741 --> 01:29:03,834
来 我来帮你
Here, let me do that.

902
01:29:27,968 --> 01:29:31,870
巴沙特女士 这个人是谁?
Miss Bagshot, who is this man?

903
01:29:43,483 --> 01:29:45,144
哈利
Harry.

904
01:29:49,189 --> 01:29:51,054
荧光闪烁
Lumos.

905
01:30:08,699 --> 01:30:10,754
"亲爱的巴蒂 多谢您的帮助 您说出了一切 即使您现在已不记得了 丽塔"

906
01:30:17,799 --> 01:30:20,554
"羽毛笔之后"丽塔・斯基特又一力作 "阿不思・邓布利多的生平和谎言"

907
01:31:31,424 --> 01:31:32,448
哈利!
Harry!

908
01:32:23,276 --> 01:32:24,334
霹雳爆炸!
Confringo!

909
01:33:07,086 --> 01:33:09,213
感觉好些了吗?
Are you feeling better?

910
01:33:12,292 --> 01:33:14,760
这次你又超越自己了 赫敏
You've outdone yourself this time, Hermione.

911
01:33:14,928 --> 01:33:17,021
迪安森林
The Forest of Dean.

912
01:33:17,997 --> 01:33:22,366
我曾和爸妈来过一次 好多年前了
I came here once with Mom and Dad, years ago.

913
01:33:23,002 --> 01:33:25,129
和我记忆中一模一样
It's just how I remember it.

914
01:33:25,538 --> 01:33:29,474
树木 河流 所有的一切
The trees, the river, everything.

915
01:33:29,776 --> 01:33:32,609
就像从未改变
Like nothing's changed.

916
01:33:33,846 --> 01:33:36,838
当然这不是真的 一切都变了
Not true, of course. Everything's changed.

917
01:33:37,817 --> 01:33:41,617
如果现在把我父母带来 他们可能根本不记得了
If I brought my parents back here now, they probably wouldn't recognize any of it.

918
01:33:43,723 --> 01:33:47,853
不记得这树木 河流...
Not the trees, not the river...

919
01:33:49,629 --> 01:33:51,756
甚至于我
not even me.

920
01:33:56,903 --> 01:33:59,701
或许我们应该留在这里 哈利
Maybe we should just stay here, Harry.

921
01:34:01,708 --> 01:34:03,835
慢慢变老
Grow old.

922
01:34:09,849 --> 01:34:13,148
你想知道照片里的男孩是谁
You wanted to know who the boy in the photograph was.

923
01:34:13,886 --> 01:34:14,978
我知道
I know.

924
01:34:16,155 --> 01:34:18,555
他叫盖勒特・格林德沃
Gellert Grindelwald.

925
01:34:25,498 --> 01:34:28,899
他是我在格里戈维奇魔杖店里见到的小偷
He's the thief I saw in Gregorovitch's Wand Shop.

926
01:34:29,068 --> 01:34:32,333
说到这里 我的魔杖呢?
Speaking of which, where is my wand?

927
01:34:33,673 --> 01:34:36,073
我的魔杖呢 赫敏?
Where's my wand, Hermione?

928
01:34:44,717 --> 01:34:49,211
我们离开戈德里克山谷的时候 我施的咒反弹了
As we were leaving Godric's Hollow, I cast a curse and it rebounded.

929
01:34:51,958 --> 01:34:53,186
抱歉
I'm sorry.

930
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:56,488
- 我试图修好它 但魔杖不同其他  - 就这样吧
- I tried to mend it, but wands are different.  - It's done.

931
01:34:58,464 --> 01:35:02,423
把你的给我 进去暖暖吧
Leave me yours. Go inside and get warm.

932
01:35:02,835 --> 01:35:05,167
挂坠也给我戴
I'll take the locket as well.

933
01:35:17,717 --> 01:35:19,082
相信我
Trust me.

934
01:36:44,837 --> 01:36:46,464
荧光闪烁
Lumos.

935
01:37:27,547 --> 01:37:28,912
宝剑飞来
Accio sword.

936
01:37:34,754 --> 01:37:36,654
四分五裂
Diffindo.

937
01:39:17,089 --> 01:39:20,252
- 赫敏?  - 你疯了吗?
- Hermione?  - Are you mental?

938
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:23,018
是你?
It was you?

939
01:39:23,195 --> 01:39:26,961
是啊 很明显嘛
Well, yeah. Bit obvious, I think.

940
01:39:27,133 --> 01:39:28,930
母鹿也是你召唤的 是吗?
And you cast the doe as well, did you?

941
01:39:29,502 --> 01:39:33,165
- 不是 我以为是你  - 不是 我的守护神是牡鹿
- No, I thought that was you.  - No, my Patronus is a stag.

942
01:39:33,339 --> 01:39:35,534
啊 对 有角
Right. Yeah. Antlers.

943
01:39:38,711 --> 01:39:41,874
好了 罗恩 动手吧
Okay, Ron. Do it.

944
01:39:42,848 --> 01:39:46,579
我不行 这东西对我的影响大过对你和赫敏
I can't handle it. That thing affects me more than it affects you and Hermione.

945
01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:49,747
- 更应如此  - 不行 我做不到
- All the more reason.  - No. I can't.

946
01:39:49,922 --> 01:39:51,150
那你为什么在这儿?
Then why are you here?

947
01:39:52,558 --> 01:39:54,617
你为什么回来?
Why did you come back?

948
01:40:02,201 --> 01:40:06,331
现在 我必须说话让它打开 等打开了 不要犹豫
Now, I'll have to speak to it in order for it to open. When it does, don't hesitate.

949
01:40:06,939 --> 01:40:09,464
我不知道里面是什么 但它肯定会奋力抵抗
I don't know what's in there, but it'll put up a fight.

950
01:40:09,642 --> 01:40:12,338
日记本里的里德尔碎片想杀了我
The bit of Riddle that was in that diary tried to kill me.

951
01:40:14,814 --> 01:40:16,441
好吧
All right.

952
01:40:17,283 --> 01:40:18,841
一...
One...

953
01:40:19,518 --> 01:40:20,576
二...
two...

954
01:40:21,253 --> 01:40:23,153
三
three.

955
01:40:33,399 --> 01:40:38,496
我窥见你的内心 而它是我的
I have seen your heart, and it is mine.

956
01:40:41,107 --> 01:40:45,009
我眼见你的梦境 罗纳德・韦斯莱...
I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley...

957
01:40:45,177 --> 01:40:47,577
我也知晓你的恐惧
and I have seen your fears.

958
01:40:49,281 --> 01:40:53,445
最不受母亲宠爱 她渴望一个女儿
Least loved by your mother, who craved a daughter.

959
01:40:54,086 --> 01:40:59,080
最不受女友喜爱 她更喜欢你的朋友
Least loved by the girl who prefers your friend.

960
01:40:59,258 --> 01:41:01,988
罗恩 杀了它!
Ron, kill it!

961
01:41:08,434 --> 01:41:11,130
我们没你更好
We were better without you.

962
01:41:11,637 --> 01:41:13,366
没你更开心
Happier without you.

963
01:41:13,539 --> 01:41:18,909
跟哈利・波特比起来谁会看你一眼?
Who could look at you compared to Harry Potter?

964
01:41:20,146 --> 01:41:23,479
跟救世之星比起来你算什么?
What are you compared with the Chosen One?

965
01:41:23,649 --> 01:41:24,809
罗恩 它在撒谎!
Ron, it's lying!

966
01:41:24,984 --> 01:41:27,976
你母亲亲口说更希望我做她的儿子
Your mother confessed she would have preferred me as a son.

967
01:41:28,154 --> 01:41:31,146
哪个女人会看上你?
What woman would take you?

968
01:41:31,357 --> 01:41:34,520
你一无是处
You are nothing.

969
01:41:34,694 --> 01:41:35,820
一文不值
Nothing.

970
01:41:36,595 --> 01:41:40,622
跟他比更是云泥之别
Nothing compared to him.

971
01:42:31,183 --> 01:42:32,844
还好...
Just think...

972
01:42:33,753 --> 01:42:35,846
只剩下三个了
only three to go.

973
01:42:38,891 --> 01:42:40,620
赫敏?
Hermione?

974
01:42:42,895 --> 01:42:44,624
赫敏?
Hermione?

975
01:42:49,168 --> 01:42:51,102
没事吧?
Is everything all right?

976
01:42:51,737 --> 01:42:56,401
没事 而且 别没事好得多了
It's fine. Actually, you know, it's more than fine.

977
01:43:00,846 --> 01:43:02,438
嘿
Hey.

978
01:43:06,685 --> 01:43:12,885
你这个混蛋 罗纳德・韦斯莱!
You complete ass, Ronald Weasley!

979
01:43:13,058 --> 01:43:16,721
消失了几个星期才出现 你就只会说"嘿"?
You show up here after weeks, and you say "hey"?

980
01:43:18,931 --> 01:43:21,661
- 我的魔杖呢 哈利? 我的魔杖呢?  - 不知道
- Where's my wand, Harry? Where's my wand?  - I don't know.

981
01:43:21,834 --> 01:43:24,098
- 哈利・波特 把魔杖给我  - 不在我这儿
- Harry Potter, give me my wand.  - I don't have it.

982
01:43:24,270 --> 01:43:28,104
- 他怎么会拿着你的魔杖?  - 不用你管
- How come he's got your wand?  - Never mind why he's got my wand.

983
01:43:30,376 --> 01:43:31,604
那是什么?
What is that?

984
01:43:34,547 --> 01:43:35,571
你销毁它了
You destroyed it.

985
01:43:38,884 --> 01:43:42,843
还有你怎么会带着格兰芬多之剑?
And how is it that you just happen to have the sword of Gryffindor?

986
01:43:43,255 --> 01:43:45,223
说来话长了
It's a long story.

987
01:43:48,394 --> 01:43:52,490
- 别以为这能起什么作用  - 哦 当然不会
- Don't think this changes anything.  - Oh, of course not.

988
01:43:52,665 --> 01:43:55,930
我刚刚只是毁掉了一个见鬼的魂器 这又能起什么作用呢?
I only just destroyed a bloody Horcrux. Why would that change anything?

989
01:43:56,101 --> 01:44:00,162
其实 刚刚离开我就想回来了
Look, I wanted to come back as soon as I left.

990
01:44:00,339 --> 01:44:03,775
- 我只是不知道怎么找到你们  - 是啊 那你是怎么找到的?
- I just didn't know how to find you.  - Yeah, how did you find us?

991
01:44:03,943 --> 01:44:07,003
用这个 这个不仅仅可以熄灭灯光
With this. It doesn't just turn off lights.

992
01:44:07,179 --> 01:44:12,082
我不知道是什么原理 不过圣诞节早晨我睡在一个小酒馆里...
I don't know how it works, but Christmas morning I was sleeping in this little pub...

993
01:44:12,251 --> 01:44:14,685
以防被搜捕队碰到...
keeping away from some Snatchers...

994
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:16,382
然后我就听到它了
and I heard it.

995
01:44:16,789 --> 01:44:18,222
什么?
It?

996
01:44:19,558 --> 01:44:21,492
一个声音...
A voice...

997
01:44:23,095 --> 01:44:24,289
是你的声音 赫敏...
your voice, Hermione...

998
01:44:25,464 --> 01:44:27,091
由它发出来
coming out of it.

999
01:44:27,266 --> 01:44:31,100
- 我能问问 我究竟说了什么吗?  - 我的名字
- And what exactly did I say, may I ask?  - My name.

1000
01:44:31,704 --> 01:44:33,729
就是我的名字
Just my name.

1001
01:44:34,506 --> 01:44:36,599
就像在我耳边
Like a whisper.

1002
01:44:38,577 --> 01:44:44,573
我就拿起来 打开它 这个小光球就出现了
So I took it, clicked it, and this tiny ball of light appeared.

1003
01:44:45,050 --> 01:44:46,483
而我知道了
And I knew.

1004
01:44:47,052 --> 01:44:51,682
而且非常确定 它飘向我 这个光球...
And sure enough, it floated toward me, the ball of light...

1005
01:44:53,392 --> 01:44:57,590
直扑我的胸口 穿过我 就从这里
went right to my chest, straight through me. Right here.

1006
01:44:58,797 --> 01:45:02,790
我就知道它会带我去我该去的地方 所以我幻影移形...
And I knew it was gonna take me where I needed to go, so I Disapparated...

1007
01:45:02,968 --> 01:45:05,232
就来到了这个山腰
and came to this hillside.

1008
01:45:05,771 --> 01:45:08,296
天色昏暗 我不知道是哪里
It was dark. I had no idea where I was.

1009
01:45:08,841 --> 01:45:11,674
我只希望能碰到你们其中一个
I just hoped that one of you would show yourself.

1010
01:45:12,578 --> 01:45:14,102
然后真就碰到了
And you did.

1011
01:45:31,530 --> 01:45:34,431
我一直很喜欢赫敏造的这些火焰
I've always liked these flames Hermione makes.

1012
01:45:38,470 --> 01:45:41,030
你估计她还会生我的气多久?
How long do you reckon she'll stay mad at me?

1013
01:45:42,574 --> 01:45:45,907
哦 继续讲那个光球触动你心的事情...
Well, just keep talking about that little ball of light touching your heart...

1014
01:45:46,078 --> 01:45:47,511
她就会接受你了
and she'll come round.

1015
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:50,410
是真的 字字不假
It was true. Every word.

1016
01:45:52,217 --> 01:45:54,583
听起来有点疯狂...
This is gonna sound crazy...

1017
01:45:55,054 --> 01:45:59,423
不过我觉得这是邓布利多把它留给我的原因 这个熄灯器
but I think that's why Dumbledore left it to me, the Deluminator.

1018
01:45:59,925 --> 01:46:04,919
他知道有一天我需要找到回归的路 而赫敏可以指引我
I think he knew that somehow I'd need it to find my way back, and she'd lead me.

1019
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:10,530
该死的 我刚想到 你需要根魔杖 对吧?
Bloody hell, I just realized, you need a wand, don't you?

1020
01:46:10,703 --> 01:46:13,194
- 是  - 我这有一根
- Yeah.  - I've got one here.

1021
01:46:13,472 --> 01:46:16,066
是黑李木的 十寸长
It's a blackthorn. Ten inches.

1022
01:46:16,241 --> 01:46:19,836
没什么特别的 不过我估计能用
Nothing special, but I reckon it'll do.

1023
01:46:20,279 --> 01:46:23,077
两周前从一个搜捕队员那里抢的
Took if off a Snatcher a couple of weeks ago.

1024
01:46:23,582 --> 01:46:27,416
别告诉赫敏 搜捕队 人员有点复杂
Don't tell Hermione this, but they're a bit dim, Snatchers.

1025
01:46:27,686 --> 01:46:30,621
闻起来这个魔杖的主人应该有巨怪血统
This one was definitely part troll, the smell of him.

1026
01:46:30,789 --> 01:46:31,813
速速变大
Engorgio.

1027
01:46:31,991 --> 01:46:34,152
- 速速缩小!  - 这怎么了?
- Reducio!  - What's going on in there?

1028
01:46:34,326 --> 01:46:35,588
- 没事  - 没事
- Nothing.  - Nothing.

1029
01:46:37,963 --> 01:46:39,590
我们需要谈谈
We need to talk.

1030
01:46:40,399 --> 01:46:41,593
对 好的
Yeah, all right.

1031
01:46:48,574 --> 01:46:52,101
- 我要去见谢诺菲留斯・洛夫古德  - 啊?
- I want to go see Xenophilius Lovegood.  - Sorry?

1032
01:46:53,879 --> 01:46:55,506
看到这个了吗?
See this?

1033
01:46:55,681 --> 01:46:59,549
是邓布利多写给格林德沃的信 看署名
It's a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald. Look at the signature.

1034
01:47:00,786 --> 01:47:02,981
又是这个标记
It's the mark again.

1035
01:47:03,922 --> 01:47:06,049
不时出现
It keeps cropping up.

1036
01:47:06,225 --> 01:47:10,594
在诗翁彼豆故事集 在戈德里克山谷
In Beedle the Bard, in the graveyard in Godric's Hollow.

1037
01:47:11,430 --> 01:47:13,295
那也有
It was there too.

1038
01:47:13,465 --> 01:47:17,060
- 哪儿?  - 格里戈维奇魔杖店门外
- Where?  - Outside Gregorovitch's Wand Shop.

1039
01:47:17,503 --> 01:47:18,731
可它是什么意思呢?
But what does it mean?

1040
01:47:18,904 --> 01:47:23,705
听我说 反正我们都不知道下一个魂器在哪里...
Look, you've got no idea where the next Horcrux is, and neither do I...

1041
01:47:25,411 --> 01:47:28,346
但这个 这个是有意义的
but this, this means something.

1042
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:32,081
- 我很肯定  - 对 赫敏说得对
- I'm sure of it.  - Yeah. Hermione's right.

1043
01:47:33,118 --> 01:47:35,211
我们应该去找洛夫古德
We ought to see Lovegood.

1044
01:47:35,721 --> 01:47:39,452
咱们投票吧 同意的举手?
Let's vote on it. Those in favor?

1045
01:48:03,282 --> 01:48:05,910
你不生他气了 是吧?
You're not still mad at him, are you?

1046
01:48:06,218 --> 01:48:08,482
我早习惯了
I'm always mad at him.

1047
01:48:11,256 --> 01:48:12,746
卢娜
Luna.

1048
01:48:12,925 --> 01:48:14,620
卢娜
Luna.

1049
01:48:14,901 --> 01:48:16,834
"勿动飞艇李"

1050
01:48:20,101 --> 01:48:21,834
"唱唱反调"主编 谢・洛夫古德

1051
01:48:22,301 --> 01:48:25,134
"勿动飞艇李"
"Keep off the dirigible plums."

1052
01:48:34,179 --> 01:48:36,875
什么事? 你们是谁?
What is it? Who are you?

1053
01:48:37,182 --> 01:48:38,206
你们要干什么?
What do you want?

1054
01:48:38,383 --> 01:48:42,979
你好 洛夫古德先生 我是哈利・波特 几个月前我们见过
Hello, Mr. Lovegood. I'm Harry Potter. We met a few months ago.

1055
01:48:46,992 --> 01:48:48,892
我们能进去吗?
Could we come in?

1056
01:48:52,664 --> 01:48:55,258
- 卢娜去哪了?  - 卢娜?
- Where is Luna?  - Luna?

1057
01:48:56,535 --> 01:48:58,503
她很快就回来了
She'll be along.

1058
01:49:12,017 --> 01:49:14,076
我能为你做些什么 波特先生?
So how can I help you, Mr. Potter?

1059
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:17,946
哦 其实...
Well, actually....

1060
01:49:18,957 --> 01:49:23,485
是关于婚礼上你戴在脖子上的一个东西的 是个标记
It was about something you were wearing round your neck at the wedding. A symbol.

1061
01:49:25,030 --> 01:49:26,930
你是说这个?
You mean this?

1062
01:49:27,332 --> 01:49:28,924
是
Yes.

1063
01:49:29,234 --> 01:49:31,099
就是它
That exactly.

1064
01:49:31,770 --> 01:49:35,729
我们想知道的是 它是什么?
What we've wondered is, what is it?

1065
01:49:35,908 --> 01:49:37,739
它是什么?
What is it?

1066
01:49:37,910 --> 01:49:40,879
哦 这是死亡圣器的标记
Well, it's the sign of the Deathly Hallows, of course.

1067
01:49:41,046 --> 01:49:42,138
- 什么?  - 什么?
- The what?  - The what?

1068
01:49:42,314 --> 01:49:44,373
死亡圣器
The Deathly Hallows.

1069
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:47,644
我估计你们都知道"三兄弟的传说"吧
I assume you're all familiar with "The Tale of the Three Brothers."

1070
01:49:47,819 --> 01:49:49,309
- 知道  - 不知道
- Yes.  - No.

1071
01:49:54,660 --> 01:49:56,423
我这有
I have it in here.

1072
01:50:07,673 --> 01:50:09,300
"曾经有三个兄弟...
"There were once three brothers...

1073
01:50:09,474 --> 01:50:13,877
在黄昏的时候行走在孤独 蜿蜒的路上"
who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight."

1074
01:50:14,046 --> 01:50:16,776
午夜 我妈妈讲的时候说是"午夜"
Midnight. Mom always said "midnight."

1075
01:50:21,787 --> 01:50:25,655
不过"黄昏"也好 其实 更好
But "twilight's" fine. Better, actually.

1076
01:50:27,926 --> 01:50:29,791
要不你来读?
Do you want to read it?

1077
01:50:29,962 --> 01:50:32,157
不了 还是你读得好
No. It's fine.

1078
01:50:34,066 --> 01:50:36,000
"曾经有三个兄弟...
"There were once three brothers...

1079
01:50:36,168 --> 01:50:41,367
在黄昏的时候行走在孤独 蜿蜒的路上
who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight.

1080
01:50:43,242 --> 01:50:48,544
最后 三兄弟来到一条无法逾越的河边
In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass.

1081
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:50,745
不过因为精通魔法...
But being learned in the magical arts...

1082
01:50:50,916 --> 01:50:56,081
三个兄弟轻松地挥一挥魔杖创造了一座桥
the three brothers simply waved their wands and made a bridge.

1083
01:50:57,422 --> 01:50:59,515
然而 在他们过河之前...
Before they could cross, however...

1084
01:50:59,691 --> 01:51:03,787
一个戴兜帽的身影挡住了他们的去路
they found their path blocked by a hooded figure.

1085
01:51:04,062 --> 01:51:07,930
是死神 他认为自己被愚弄了
It was Death, and he felt cheated.

1086
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:11,160
因为通常的行路人都会溺死于河中
Cheated because travelers would normally drown in the river.

1087
01:51:11,336 --> 01:51:13,395
不过死神很奸诈
But Death was cunning.

1088
01:51:14,039 --> 01:51:17,031
他祝贺三兄弟魔力高强...
He pretended to congratulate the three brothers on their magic...

1089
01:51:17,209 --> 01:51:22,476
还说他们因为聪明到可以逃避死亡而获得奖励
and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him.

1090
01:51:23,048 --> 01:51:27,610
大哥要了一根世上最强力的魔杖
The oldest asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence.

1091
01:51:27,786 --> 01:51:32,382
于是死神用附近一棵接骨木的树枝做了一根
So Death fashioned him one from an elder tree that stood nearby.

1092
01:51:33,792 --> 01:51:38,092
二哥决定要变本加厉地羞辱死神...
The second brother decided he wanted to humiliate Death even further...

1093
01:51:38,263 --> 01:51:42,700
要求能让自己的爱人死而复生的能力
and asked for the power to recall loved ones from the grave.

1094
01:51:43,135 --> 01:51:47,435
死神从河中挖起一块石头送给了他
So Death plucked a stone from the river and offered it to him.

1095
01:51:48,173 --> 01:51:52,132
最后 死神转向老三
Finally, Death turned to the third brother.

1096
01:51:53,345 --> 01:51:54,778
这个谦恭的人...
A humble man...

1097
01:51:54,946 --> 01:51:59,144
要求一件可以让他继续前进...
he asked for something that would allow him to go forth from that place...

1098
01:51:59,318 --> 01:52:02,481
而不被死神尾随的东西
without being followed by Death.

1099
01:52:03,588 --> 01:52:09,458
所以死神勉为其难把自己的隐形衣送给了他
And so it was that Death reluctantly handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.

1100
01:52:12,831 --> 01:52:15,766
最年长的兄弟到了一个遥远的村落...
The first brother traveled to a distant village...

1101
01:52:15,934 --> 01:52:18,027
在那里 凭借手中的老魔杖...
where, with the Elder Wand in hand...

1102
01:52:18,203 --> 01:52:21,969
他杀掉了一个曾经与他争执过的巫师
he killed a wizard with whom he had once quarreled.

1103
01:52:24,176 --> 01:52:27,703
带着老魔杖带给他的魔力酒醉之后...
Drunk with the power that the Elder Wand had given him...

1104
01:52:27,879 --> 01:52:30,973
他吹嘘自己是无敌的
he bragged of his invincibility.

1105
01:52:33,985 --> 01:52:37,443
不过就在当晚 另一个巫师偷走了魔杖...
But that night, another wizard stole the wand...

1106
01:52:37,622 --> 01:52:40,750
保险起见 还割断了他的喉咙
and slit the brother's throat for good measure.

1107
01:52:40,959 --> 01:52:44,395
所以大哥最终还是落在了死神的手里
And so Death took the first brother for his own.

1108
01:52:45,130 --> 01:52:47,098
二哥回到了家园...
The second brother journeyed to his home...

1109
01:52:47,265 --> 01:52:50,234
拿出石头在手中转了三次
where he took the stone and turned it thrice in hand.

1110
01:52:50,402 --> 01:52:54,862
为之欣喜的是 那位他不及迎娶就逝世的姑娘...
To his delight, the girl he'd once hoped to marry before her untimely death...

1111
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:57,406
出现在了他面前
appeared before him.

1112
01:52:57,909 --> 01:53:03,211
可是 很快她因为得到了永生而变得悲伤冷漠
Yet, soon she turned sad and cold for she did not belong in the mortal world.

1113
01:53:03,382 --> 01:53:05,009
被无望的渴求逼疯之后...
Driven mad with hopeless longing...

1114
01:53:05,183 --> 01:53:08,482
二哥自杀殉情
the second brother killed himself so as to join her.

1115
01:53:09,688 --> 01:53:12,782
他也没有逃脱死神的魔爪
And so Death took the second brother.

1116
01:53:12,958 --> 01:53:14,585
而最小的弟弟...
As for the third brother...

1117
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:18,992
死神寻找了他很多年却无法找到
Death searched for many years but was never able to find him.

1118
01:53:19,164 --> 01:53:22,065
一直到他年纪很大的时候 这位老三...
Only when he attained a great age did the youngest brother...

1119
01:53:22,234 --> 01:53:26,500
才脱下了隐形衣交给了他的儿子
shed the Cloak of Invisibility and give it to his son.

1120
01:53:27,739 --> 01:53:31,869
然后像老朋友一样问候了死神并跟他一起欣然地离开了...
He then greeted Death as an old friend and went with him gladly...

1121
01:53:32,043 --> 01:53:35,206
与世无争地离世"
departing this life as equals."

1122
01:53:37,282 --> 01:53:41,776
这样你们就明白了 那就是死亡圣器
So there you are. Those are the Deathly Hallows.

1123
01:53:43,188 --> 01:53:46,248
抱歉 先生 我还是不太明白
I'm sorry, sir. I still don't quite understand.

1124
01:53:51,863 --> 01:53:53,956
我的笔放哪了?
Where's that pen I had?

1125
01:54:04,943 --> 01:54:06,205
老魔杖
The Elder Wand.

1126
01:54:07,345 --> 01:54:11,008
世上最强力的魔杖
The most powerful wand ever made.

1127
01:54:21,393 --> 01:54:23,691
复活石
The Resurrection Stone.

1128
01:54:34,573 --> 01:54:38,339
隐形衣
The Cloak of Invisibility.

1129
01:54:40,378 --> 01:54:43,506
放在一起 就组成了死亡圣器
Together, they make the Deathly Hallows.

1130
01:54:43,782 --> 01:54:49,243
放在一起 就能成为死神的主人
Together, they make one master of Death.

1131
01:54:54,459 --> 01:54:58,122
那个标记在戈德里克山谷的一个墓穴上出现过
That mark was on a grave in Godric's Hollow.

1132
01:54:59,231 --> 01:55:01,859
呃 洛夫古德先生 佩弗利尔家族...
Uh, Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell Family...

1133
01:55:02,033 --> 01:55:03,864
和死亡圣器有什么关系吗?
have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?

1134
01:55:04,035 --> 01:55:06,868
呃... 呃...
Uh... Uh...

1135
01:55:07,038 --> 01:55:10,804
伊格诺图斯... 请原谅 还有他的兄弟 卡德摩斯和安提俄克...
Ignotus... Excuse me. And his brothers, Cadmus and Antioch...

1136
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:13,638
被认为是死亡圣器的原始拥有者...
are thought to be the original owners of the Hallows...

1137
01:55:13,812 --> 01:55:18,681
还有这个故事的启示 呃... 呃...
and therefore the inspiration for the story. Uh... Uh...

1138
01:55:18,850 --> 01:55:21,341
不过你们的茶要凉了
But your tea's gone cold.

1139
01:55:22,554 --> 01:55:24,545
我很快回来
I'll be right back.

1140
01:55:24,723 --> 01:55:26,588
咱们下去吧
Let's go down here.

1141
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:29,950
咱们走吧
Let's get out of here.

1142
01:55:30,128 --> 01:55:32,995
不管是凉是热 我不想再喝那东西了
I'm not drinking any more of that stuff, hot or cold.

1143
01:55:39,304 --> 01:55:41,272
谢谢 先生
Thank you, sir.

1144
01:55:42,173 --> 01:55:45,199
- 你忘记水了  - 水?
- You forgot the water.  - Water?

1145
01:55:45,377 --> 01:55:46,810
泡茶的
For the tea.

1146
01:55:46,978 --> 01:55:49,538
有...? 我有吗?
Did...? Did I?

1147
01:55:51,483 --> 01:55:53,644
我可真傻
How silly of me.

1148
01:55:55,253 --> 01:55:57,517
没关系的 我们真的该走了
It's no matter. We really should be going anyway.

1149
01:55:57,689 --> 01:55:59,748
不 不行!
No, you can't!

1150
01:56:03,962 --> 01:56:05,657
先生?
Sir?

1151
01:56:13,038 --> 01:56:15,632
你们是我唯一的希望
You're my only hope.

1152
01:56:19,511 --> 01:56:23,880
我写的那些东西 惹怒了他们
They were angry, you see, about what I'd been writing.

1153
01:56:26,918 --> 01:56:29,045
所以他们带走了她
So they took her.

1154
01:56:30,522 --> 01:56:33,286
他们抓走了卢娜
They took my Luna.

1155
01:56:34,993 --> 01:56:36,620
我的卢娜
My Luna.

1156
01:56:49,107 --> 01:56:52,008
可是他们真正要找的是你
But it's really you they want.

1157
01:56:54,245 --> 01:56:56,304
先生 什么人抓了她?
Who took her, sir?

1158
01:57:01,453 --> 01:57:02,715
伏地魔
Voldemort.

1159
01:57:13,365 --> 01:57:15,663
停手! 我抓到他了!
Stop! I've got him!

1160
01:57:32,951 --> 01:57:36,853
这个背信弃义的混蛋 难道我们就没有人可以信任了吗?
That treacherous little bleeder. Is there no one we can trust?

1161
01:57:37,022 --> 01:57:39,320
因为他支持我所以他们绑架了卢娜
They kidnapped her because he supported me.

1162
01:57:39,491 --> 01:57:41,618
他只是绝望所致
He was just desperate.

1163
01:57:42,160 --> 01:57:44,355
我来施法
I'll do the enchantments.

1164
01:57:56,041 --> 01:57:57,474
你好啊 美人儿
Hello, beautiful.

1165
01:58:02,947 --> 01:58:06,576
哦 别愣着了 抓住他们
Well, don't hang about, snatch them.

1166
01:59:17,822 --> 01:59:19,312
哈利
Harry.

1167
01:59:19,491 --> 01:59:22,460
告诉我 格林德沃 告诉我它在哪
Tell me, Grindelwald. Tell me where it is.

1168
01:59:23,061 --> 01:59:27,122
格林德沃 格林德沃 格林德沃
Grindelwald. Grindelwald. Grindelwald.

1169
01:59:27,866 --> 01:59:31,324
你好 汤姆 我知道你早晚会来...
Hello, Tom. I knew you would come one day...

1170
01:59:31,803 --> 01:59:35,762
不过你也肯定知道我没有你要的东西了
but surely you must know I no longer have what you seek.

1171
01:59:36,407 --> 01:59:39,433
- 告诉我 格林德沃 告诉我它在哪  - 哈... 哈... 哈
- Tell me, Grindelwald. Tell me where it is.  - Ha... ha... ha.

1172
01:59:39,611 --> 01:59:40,976
告诉我归谁所有
Tell me who possesses it.

1173
01:59:41,179 --> 01:59:46,276
老魔杖当然陪他长眠...
The Elder Wand lies with him, of course...

1174
01:59:46,451 --> 01:59:48,715
深埋入土
buried in the earth.

1175
01:59:49,654 --> 01:59:50,985
邓布利多
Dumbledore.

1176
02:00:00,031 --> 02:00:01,896
圣器真的存在...
The Hallows exist...

1177
02:00:02,066 --> 02:00:05,866
不过他只在寻找其中之一 最后一件 他知道在哪里
but he's only after one of them, the last one. He knows where it is.

1178
02:00:06,037 --> 02:00:09,871
今夜结束之前他就能够据为己有 神秘人拿到了老魔杖
He's gonna have it by the end of the night. You... Know... Who's found the Elder Wand.

1179
02:00:10,041 --> 02:00:12,509
- 别碰她 啊!  - 放开他
- Don't touch her. Unh!  - Leave him.

1180
02:00:12,677 --> 02:00:13,939
你的男朋友如果不识时务的话...
Your boyfriend will get worse than that...

1181
02:00:14,112 --> 02:00:15,238
放开我
Get off me.

1182
02:00:15,413 --> 02:00:18,143
会比这样还难受的
if he doesn't learn to behave himself.

1183
02:00:21,386 --> 02:00:22,876
你怎么回事 丑八怪?
What happened to you, ugly?

1184
02:00:24,589 --> 02:00:26,454
不 不是说你
No, not you.

1185
02:00:27,859 --> 02:00:30,919
- 你叫什么?  - 达力 弗农・达力
- What's your name?  - Dudley. Vernon Dudley.

1186
02:00:31,095 --> 02:00:33,290
检查一下
Check it.

1187
02:00:34,899 --> 02:00:37,231
还有你 亲爱的...
And you, my lovely...

1188
02:00:40,538 --> 02:00:42,529
你叫什么?
what do they call you?

1189
02:00:43,975 --> 02:00:48,036
佩内洛・克里瓦特 混血
Penelope Clearwater, half-blood.

1190
02:00:51,149 --> 02:00:53,083
这里没有弗农・达力
There's no Vernon Dudley on here.

1191
02:00:54,152 --> 02:00:57,383
你听到了吗 丑八怪? 名单证明你在撒谎
Did you hear that, ugly? The list says you're lying.

1192
02:00:57,555 --> 02:00:59,785
为什么隐瞒身份?
How come you don't want us to know who you are?

1193
02:00:59,958 --> 02:01:02,620
名单是错的 我告诉你我是谁了
The list's wrong. I told you who I am.

1194
02:01:18,576 --> 02:01:20,669
计划改变
Change of plan.

1195
02:01:21,746 --> 02:01:25,011
这些人不带去魔法部了
We're not taking this lot to the Ministry.

1196
02:02:04,689 --> 02:02:08,318
带德拉科来
Get Draco.

1197
02:02:12,797 --> 02:02:14,355
怎么样?
Well?

1198
02:02:17,468 --> 02:02:21,996
- 我不确定  - 德拉科 近点看 孩子
- I can't be sure.  - Draco. Look closely, son.

1199
02:02:23,007 --> 02:02:28,070
如果由我们把波特交给黑魔王...
If we are the ones to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord...

1200
02:02:28,246 --> 02:02:33,479
一切都会被原谅的 一切都会重归以往 明白吗?
everything would be forgiven. All would be as it was, you understand?

1201
02:02:33,651 --> 02:02:37,781
噢 马尔福先生 我希望 别忘记是谁抓到他的
Now, we won't be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy.

1202
02:02:37,956 --> 02:02:40,390
你在我家也敢这样跟我讲话?
You dare to talk to me like that in my own house?

1203
02:02:40,558 --> 02:02:42,355
卢修斯
Lucius.

1204
02:02:45,263 --> 02:02:49,097
别害羞 宝贝 过来
Don't be shy, sweetie. Come over.

1205
02:02:50,601 --> 02:02:55,368
如果这不是波特 德拉科 我们却把他请来 他会杀光我们的
Now, if this isn't who we think it is, Draco, and we call him, he'll kill us all.

1206
02:02:55,540 --> 02:02:58,338
我们需要非常确定
We need to be absolutely sure.

1207
02:02:58,643 --> 02:02:59,632
他的脸怎么了?
What's wrong with his face?

1208
02:02:59,811 --> 02:03:01,540
对啊 他的脸怎么了?
Yes, what is wrong with his face?

1209
02:03:01,713 --> 02:03:02,907
抓到他的时候就是这样
He came to us like that.

1210
02:03:03,081 --> 02:03:05,049
我估计 是他在树林里搞的
Something he picked up in the forest, I reckon.

1211
02:03:05,216 --> 02:03:08,913
或者是中了蜇人咒 是你干的吗 亲爱的?
Or ran into a Stinging Jinx. Was it you, dearie?

1212
02:03:14,025 --> 02:03:16,789
把她的魔杖给我 我们就能知道她最后用的咒语是什么了
Give me her wand. We'll see what her last spell was.

1213
02:03:18,062 --> 02:03:20,223
哈 肯定是你
Ah. Got you.

1214
02:03:24,035 --> 02:03:25,764
那是什么?
What is that?

1215
02:03:27,705 --> 02:03:29,297
你这从哪来的?
Where'd you get that from?

1216
02:03:29,474 --> 02:03:32,966
我们抓到她的时候从她袋子里找到的 现在算是我的了
It was in her bag when we searched her. Reckon it's mine now.

1217
02:03:36,714 --> 02:03:38,045
你疯了?
Are you mad?

1218
02:03:46,357 --> 02:03:49,190
滚! 快滚!
Go! Get out!

1219
02:03:54,832 --> 02:03:58,996
西茜 把小伙子们关进地牢
Cissy, put the boys in the cellar.

1220
02:03:59,170 --> 02:04:04,540
我要跟这个谈谈 女人跟女人的谈话
I want to have a little conversation with this one, girl-to-girl.

1221
02:04:13,584 --> 02:04:16,678
我们怎么办? 我们不能把赫敏一个人丢给她
What are we gonna do? We can't leave Hermione alone with her.

1222
02:04:16,854 --> 02:04:18,219
罗恩?
Ron?

1223
02:04:23,428 --> 02:04:24,986
哈利?
Harry?

1224
02:04:30,701 --> 02:04:32,259
卢娜?
Luna?

1225
02:04:32,870 --> 02:04:37,034
这把剑应该在古灵阁我的金库里 你怎么拿到的?
That sword is meant to be in my vault at Gringotts. How did you get it?

1226
02:04:37,208 --> 02:04:40,336
你们还拿了我什么东西?!
What else did you and your friends take from my vault?!

1227
02:04:40,511 --> 02:04:45,881
我什么都没拿 真的 我什么都没拿
I didn't take anything. Please. I didn't take anything.

1228
02:04:46,050 --> 02:04:47,574
我不相信
I don't believe it.

1229
02:04:53,157 --> 02:04:54,249
我们要采取措施
We have to do something.

1230
02:04:54,425 --> 02:04:58,452
出不去 我们都试过了 都被施了魔法
There's no way out of here. We've tried everything. It's enchanted.

1231
02:04:58,629 --> 02:05:01,325
- 求你! 求你!  - 闭嘴!
- Please! please!  - Shut up!

1232
02:05:01,499 --> 02:05:03,296
你流血了 哈利
You're bleeding, Harry.

1233
02:05:03,468 --> 02:05:05,493
你袜子里装这东西真有意思
That's a curious thing to keep in your sock.

1234
02:05:14,745 --> 02:05:15,871
帮帮我们
Help us.

1235
02:05:21,652 --> 02:05:23,552
- 放了她  - 闭嘴 退后
- Let her go.  - Shut up. Get back.

1236
02:05:24,889 --> 02:05:29,087
你 妖精 跟我走
You, goblin, come with me.

1237
02:05:48,746 --> 02:05:50,236
- 啊!  - 多比?
- Aah!  - Dobby?

1238
02:05:51,115 --> 02:05:52,514
你来干什么?
What are you doing here?

1239
02:05:52,683 --> 02:05:54,947
多比当然是来救哈利・波特的
Dobby has come to rescue Harry Potter, of course.

1240
02:05:55,119 --> 02:05:57,587
多比会永远支持哈利・波特
Dobby will always be there for Harry Potter.

1241
02:05:57,755 --> 02:06:01,350
在这里你可以幻影移形? 你能带我们一起走吗?
You can Apparate in and out of this room? Could you take us with you?

1242
02:06:01,526 --> 02:06:03,289
当然 先生 我是个精灵
Of course, sir. I'm an elf.

1243
02:06:04,095 --> 02:06:05,960
可以的
Works for me.

1244
02:06:06,197 --> 02:06:08,563
多比 我要你带着卢娜和奥利凡德先生...
Dobby, I want you to take Luna and Mr. Ollivander...

1245
02:06:08,733 --> 02:06:11,167
去丁沃斯郊外的贝壳小屋
Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth.

1246
02:06:11,536 --> 02:06:12,560
放心吧
Trust me.

1247
02:06:13,371 --> 02:06:14,804
随时可以 先生
Whenever you're ready, sir.

1248
02:06:15,506 --> 02:06:18,202
先生? 我很喜欢她
Sir? I like her very much.

1249
02:06:23,147 --> 02:06:26,446
10秒之后在上面等我
Meet me at the top of the stairs in 10 seconds.

1250
02:06:35,526 --> 02:06:37,289
噢
Ow.

1251
02:06:42,700 --> 02:06:44,930
有谁缺魔杖吗?
Who gets his wand?

1252
02:06:47,672 --> 02:06:51,665
我只问你一遍 妖精
I'm only going to ask you once more, goblin.

1253
02:06:51,842 --> 02:06:55,243
回答之前三思 再三思
Think very, very carefully before you answer.

1254
02:06:55,613 --> 02:06:57,171
我不知道
I don't know.

1255
02:06:57,348 --> 02:07:00,545
你不知道? 你怎么不尽职?
You don't know? Why weren't you doing your job?

1256
02:07:00,718 --> 02:07:03,949
谁进入了我的金库?
Who got into my vault?

1257
02:07:05,223 --> 02:07:09,660
谁偷的? 谁偷走的? 嗯?
Who stole it? Who stole it? Well?

1258
02:07:09,827 --> 02:07:13,854
当我最后一次离开你的金库的时候 剑还在那
When I was last in your vault, the sword was there.

1259
02:07:14,501 --> 02:07:15,999
泥巴种

1260
02:07:16,634 --> 02:07:19,831
哦 那么 是它自己跑出来的了
Oh, well then, perhaps it just walked out on its own then.

1261
02:07:20,004 --> 02:07:22,438
没有比古灵阁更安全的地方
There is no place safer than Gringotts.

1262
02:07:22,607 --> 02:07:24,040
骗子!
Liar!

1263
02:07:25,977 --> 02:07:29,378
庆幸吧 妖精
Consider yourself lucky, goblin.

1264
02:07:31,816 --> 02:07:35,217
她就没有你这么幸运
The same won't be said for this one.

1265
02:07:35,386 --> 02:07:37,149
该死
Like hell.

1266
02:07:37,888 --> 02:07:39,116
除你武器!
Expelliarmus!

1267
02:07:40,558 --> 02:07:41,650
昏昏倒地
Stupefy.

1268
02:07:45,796 --> 02:07:47,161
住手!
Stop!

1269
02:07:48,332 --> 02:07:49,890
丢掉魔杖
Drop your wands.

1270
02:07:52,770 --> 02:07:53,794
我说了 丢掉!
I said, drop them!

1271
02:07:55,306 --> 02:07:56,739
捡起来 德拉科 快
Pick them up, Draco, now.

1272
02:07:57,608 --> 02:08:01,738
哦 哦 哦 看看这是谁
Well, well, well, look what we have here.

1273
02:08:03,347 --> 02:08:04,837
是哈利・波特
It's Harry Potter.

1274
02:08:05,616 --> 02:08:11,987
他又阳光回来了 正好赶上送给黑魔王
He's all bright and shiny and new again, just in time for the Dark Lord.

1275
02:08:12,156 --> 02:08:14,181
通知他
Call him.

1276
02:08:17,928 --> 02:08:19,725
通知他
Call him.

1277
02:08:54,932 --> 02:08:56,763
昏昏倒地!
Stupefy!

1278
02:08:57,535 --> 02:08:59,230
愚蠢的精灵
Stupid elf.

1279
02:08:59,403 --> 02:09:02,429
- 你差点杀了我  - 多比不想杀人
- You could've killed me.  - Dobby never meant to kill.

1280
02:09:02,606 --> 02:09:06,633
多比只想致残或者重伤
Dobby only meant to maim or seriously injure.

1281
02:09:08,946 --> 02:09:12,279
你竟敢夺走一个巫师的魔杖?
How dare you take a witch's wand?

1282
02:09:12,450 --> 02:09:15,442
你竟敢反抗主人?
How dare you defy your masters?

1283
02:09:15,619 --> 02:09:18,747
多比没有主人
Dobby has no master.

1284
02:09:18,923 --> 02:09:21,414
多比是自由的精灵
Dobby is a free elf.

1285
02:09:21,592 --> 02:09:26,552
而且多比来拯救哈利・波特和他的朋友们
And Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends.

1286
02:09:56,394 --> 02:09:58,055
赫敏
Hermione.

1287
02:09:58,229 --> 02:10:00,720
你没事了 我们安全了
You're all right. We're safe.

1288
02:10:00,898 --> 02:10:02,923
我们安全了
We're all safe.

1289
02:10:03,801 --> 02:10:05,996
哈利・波特
Harry Potter.

1290
02:10:09,740 --> 02:10:11,571
多比
Dobby.

1291
02:10:22,086 --> 02:10:25,146
多比 不 你... 坚持住
Dobby. No, just... Hold on.

1292
02:10:25,322 --> 02:10:29,656
坚持 坚持住 好吗?
Hold on. Look, just hold on, okay?

1293
02:10:29,827 --> 02:10:31,886
我们会救你的
We'll fix you.

1294
02:10:32,329 --> 02:10:35,059
赫敏会有办法
Hermione will have something.

1295
02:10:35,232 --> 02:10:37,564
在你袋子里 是吧赫敏?
In your bag. Hermione?

1296
02:10:39,203 --> 02:10:40,534
赫敏?
Hermione?

1297
02:10:42,740 --> 02:10:45,868
有什么? 帮帮我
What is it? Help me.

1298
02:10:48,446 --> 02:10:51,574
真是个美丽的地方...
Such a beautiful place...

1299
02:10:53,751 --> 02:10:56,015
跟朋友们在一起
to be with friends.

1300
02:10:57,822 --> 02:11:03,226
多比很高兴跟他的朋友...
Dobby is happy to be with his friend...

1301
02:11:05,629 --> 02:11:08,063
哈利・波特在一起
Harry Potter.

1302
02:11:28,853 --> 02:11:31,253
我们让他瞑目吧
We should close his eyes.

1303
02:11:31,489 --> 02:11:33,514
你觉得呢?
Don't you think?

1304
02:11:38,629 --> 02:11:40,028
好了
There.

1305
02:11:40,498 --> 02:11:42,932
这样他就可以安息了
Now he could be sleeping.

1306
02:11:58,249 --> 02:12:00,308
我要埋葬他
I want to bury him.

1307
02:12:01,352 --> 02:12:04,913
传统的 不用魔法
Properly. Without magic.

1308
02:13:14,815 --> 02:13:22,034
 
1309
02:13:22,135 --> 02:13:37,094
