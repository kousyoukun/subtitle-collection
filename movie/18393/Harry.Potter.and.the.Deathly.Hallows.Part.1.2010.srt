2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,230
These are dark time there is no denying.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,230
毫无疑问  黑暗时期已经来临

4
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:46,390
Our world has prehaps faced no greater threat than it does today.

5
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:46,390
我们的世界面临着前所未有的威胁

6
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,800
But I say this to our citizens.

7
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,800
但我要对我的人民说

8
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,820
We, ever your servants ...

9
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,820
我们  作为你们的公仆

10
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,245
will continue to defend you liberty

11
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,245
会一如既往地扞卫你们的自由

12
00:00:59,246 --> 00:01:02,531
and repel the forces that seek to take it from you.

13
00:00:59,246 --> 00:01:02,531
击退那些企图压迫你们的黑恶力量

14
00:01:04,954 --> 00:01:11,682
Your ministry remains strong.

15
00:01:04,954 --> 00:01:11,682
你们的魔法部依旧强大

16
00:01:15,862 --> 00:01:19,020
黑魔标记传播着恐怖

17
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,500
麻瓜家庭惨遭杀害

18
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,030
食死徒数量大增

19
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,268
Hermione, tea is ready, Darling.

20
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,268
赫敏  亲爱的  茶泡好了

21
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:33,370
Coming, Mom!

22
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:33,370
妈妈  来了

23
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,980
Come on! Dudley hurry up.

24
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,980
快点  达力  快

25
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,240
I still don't understand why we have to leave?

26
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,240
我还是不明白  为什么非得走

27
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,240
Because it's not safe around here anymore.

28
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,240
因为这里不再安全了

29
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,210
Ron, tell your father suppers nearly ready.

30
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,210
罗恩  跟爸爸说晚餐快好了

31
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,620
- She's so strong here. - Mm, she's wonderful isn't it.

32
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,620
-她能应付这些事  -她多棒啊

33
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,680
Obliviate.

34
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,680
一忘皆空

35
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:40,460
哈利波特与死亡圣器  上

36
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,680
Severus, I was beginning to worry you had lost your way.

37
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,680
西弗勒斯  我正担心你迷路了呢

38
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,190
Come, we have saved you a seat.

39
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,190
来  给你留了个座位

40
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,788
Do you bring news, I trust.

41
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,788
你应该带来了些情报吧

42
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:57,750
It will happen Saturday, next. At night fall.

43
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:57,750
下星期六  夜幕降临之时

44
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,560
I've heard differently my lord.

45
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,560
主人  我听到的有所不同

46
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,720
Dawlish, the auror has let slip that the Potter boy,

47
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,720
那个傲罗德力士无意中透漏

48
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,660
will not be moved until the 30th of this month.

49
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,660
波特要到30号  也就是他满17岁的前一天

50
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,740
The day before he turns 17.

51
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,740
才会转移

52
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,720
This is a false trail.

53
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,720
这是条假情报

54
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,771
The auror office no longer

55
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,771
傲罗办公室不再参与

56
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,280
plays any part in the protection of Harry Potter.

57
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,280
保护哈利·波特的行动

58
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,760
Those closest to him believe we have infiltrated the Ministry.

59
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,760
凤凰社相信我们的人已经打入了魔法部

60
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,420
Well, they got that right, didn't they.

61
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,420
难得啊  他们总算弄对了一件事

62
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,490
What say you, Pius?

63
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,490
你怎么看  皮尔斯

64
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,030
One hears many things, my lord.

65
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,030
主人  乱花渐欲迷人眼

66
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,280
Whether the truth is among them, is not clear.

67
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,280
哪怕真相就在其中  也很难去伪存真

68
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,340
Spoken like a true politician.

69
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,340
这话说得像个政客

70
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,520
You will I think prove most useful, Pius.

71
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,520
以后会有你发挥的时候  皮尔斯

72
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,500
Where will he be taken, the boy?

73
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,500
他们打算把那男孩藏哪

74
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:52,770
To a safe house.

75
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:52,770
一个安全的地方

76
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,710
Most likely the home of someone in the Order.

77
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,710
应该是某个凤凰社成员的家里

78
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,570
I'm told its been given every manner of protection possible.

79
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,570
据说他们已经采取了各种保护措施

80
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,150
Once there it will be impractical to attack him

81
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,150
一旦他到了那里  就很难再抓到他了

82
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,450
My lord,

83
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,450
主人

84
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,340
I'd like to volunteer myself for this task.

85
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,340
我请缨参加这次行动

86
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,670
I want to kill the boy.

87
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,670
我要杀了那男孩

88
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,320
Wormtail!

89
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,320
虫尾巴

90
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,890
Have I not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet?

91
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,890
我没跟你说过吗  让客人保持安静

92
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,780
Yes, my lord.

93
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,780
是的  主人

94
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,950
Right away, my lord.

95
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,950
马上  主人

96
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,340
As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix.

97
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,340
你这种杀戮的欲望很鼓舞人心  贝拉特里克斯

98
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,090
I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.

99
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,090
但杀死哈利·波特的人  必须是我

100
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,930
But I face an unfortunate complication.

101
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,930
不幸的是  我面临一个难题

102
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:40,660
That my wand and Potters share the same core.

103
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:40,660
我和波特的魔杖共用一个杖芯

104
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,041
They are, in some ways,

105
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,041
从某种程度上来说

106
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,718
twins.

107
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,718
它们是双胞胎

108
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,970
We can wound but not fatally harm one another.

109
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,970
虽能造成伤害  但杀不死对方

110
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,920
If I am to kill him,

111
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,920
要想干掉他

112
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,720
I must do it with another's wand.

113
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,720
我必须用另一根魔杖

114
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:09,570
Come, surely one of you would like the honor.

115
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:09,570
当然  你们中的一位会享此殊荣

116
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:19,400
What about you, Lucius?

117
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:19,400
你怎么样  卢修斯

118
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,470
- My lord? - "My Lord"?

119
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,470
-主人  -"主人"

120
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,010
I require your wand.

121
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,010
我要你的魔杖

122
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,560
- Do I detect elm? - Yes, my Lord.

123
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,560
-是榆木做的吗  -是的  主人

124
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,050
And the core?

125
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,050
杖芯呢

126
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,060
- Dragon heartstring, my lord. - Dragon heartstring?

127
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,060
-龙心腱  主人  -龙心腱

128
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,440
To those of you who do not know,

129
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,440
也许你们有些人还不知道

130
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,405
we are joined tonight by

131
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,405
今晚我们请到了

132
00:08:22,406 --> 00:08:24,460
Miss Charity Burbage.

133
00:08:22,406 --> 00:08:24,460
凯瑞迪·巴布吉教授

134
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,543
Who until recently taught

135
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,543
她此前

136
00:08:26,544 --> 00:08:29,970
at Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry

137
00:08:26,544 --> 00:08:29,970
一直在霍格沃茨魔法学校教魔法和巫术

138
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,050
Her specialty was muggle studies

139
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,050
她的专长是麻瓜研究

140
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,513
It is Miss Burbage's belief

141
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,513
巴布吉教授相信

142
00:08:38,514 --> 00:08:42,500
that Muggles are not so different from us.

143
00:08:38,514 --> 00:08:42,500
麻瓜与我们毫无差别

144
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,980
She would, given her way,

145
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,980
她认为

146
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,990
have us mate with them.

147
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,990
我们应该与麻瓜通婚

148
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,892
To her the mixture of magical and Muggle blood

149
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,892
用她的话说  麻瓜与巫师通婚

150
00:08:57,352 --> 00:08:58,970
is not an abomination,

151
00:08:57,352 --> 00:08:58,970
不应引以为耻

152
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,610
but something, to be encouraged.

153
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,610
反而值得鼓励

154
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,230
Severus.

155
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,230
西弗勒斯

156
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,260
Severus, please.

157
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,260
西弗勒斯  求你了

158
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,330
We're friends.

159
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,330
我们是朋友

160
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,680
Nagini.

161
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,680
纳吉尼

162
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,030
Dinner.

163
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,030
用餐吧

164
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,920
讣文: 怀念邓布利多

165
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,070
作者: 埃非亚斯·多吉

166
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,190
Hello, Harry!

167
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,190
你好 哈利

168
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,770
- Hello! - You're looking fit.

169
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,770
-你好  -你看起来不错

170
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah, he's absolutely gorgeous...

171
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,000
那还用说  他绝对没问题

172
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,510
I say lets get undercover, before someone murders him.

173
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,510
我说趁敌人对他动手前  赶快行动

174
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,600
Evening.

175
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,600
晚上好

176
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,369
Kingsley, I thought you were looking after the Prime Minister?

177
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,369
金斯莱  你不是一直在保护麻瓜首相吗

178
00:11:39,404 --> 00:11:41,300
You are more important.

179
00:11:39,404 --> 00:11:41,300
你更重要

180
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,332
Hello Harry. Bill Weasley.

181
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,332
你好  哈利  比尔·韦斯莱

182
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,310
Oh, pleasure to meet you.

183
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,310
很高兴见到你

184
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,460
- He wasn't always so handsome - Daredevil.

185
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,460
-他平时没这么帅  -冒失鬼

186
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,600
True enough.

187
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,600
绝对的

188
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,101
Caught one in Wales,

189
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,101
我在威尔士

190
00:11:51,102 --> 00:11:53,091
name of Greyback

191
00:11:51,102 --> 00:11:53,091
捕了一个只灰背

192
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:54,370
I think I'll favor him one day.

193
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:54,370
也许有一天我会喜欢上它

194
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,240
Oh you're still beautiful to me, William.

195
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,240
在我眼里你还是那么帅  威廉

196
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,353
Must remember,

197
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,353
你要小心

198
00:11:57,354 --> 00:11:59,960
Fleur Bill takes his steak on the raw side now.

199
00:11:57,354 --> 00:11:59,960
芙蓉·比尔现在迷恋生牛排了

200
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,000
My husband the joker.

201
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,000
我丈夫就爱开玩笑

202
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,123
By the way, wait till you hear the news,

203
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,123
对了  一直想告诉你们

204
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,240
Reamus and I...

205
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,240
我和莱姆斯...

206
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,360
All right then, time for a cozy catch up later.

207
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,360
够了  没时间聊家常了

208
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,340
We've got to get the hell out of here. And soon.

209
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,340
我们必须离开这里  越快越好

210
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,477
Potter, you're underage,

211
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,477
波特  你还未成年

212
00:12:13,478 --> 00:12:15,370
which means you've still got the trace on you.

213
00:12:13,478 --> 00:12:15,370
这意味着你身上仍带有踪丝

214
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,510
What's the trace?

215
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,510
什么踪丝

216
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,678
If you sneezed,

217
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,678
如果你打个喷嚏

218
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,340
the Ministry will know who wipes your nose.

219
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,340
魔法部就会知道谁给你擦的鼻子

220
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,622
The point is we have to use

221
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,622
关键是我们得用

222
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:22,850
those means of transport the trace can't detect.

223
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:22,850
踪丝无法探测的方式转移

224
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,530
Brooms, thestrals and the bike. We'll go in pairs.

225
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,530
飞天扫帚  夜骐和飞天摩托  我们结对走

226
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,580
That way if anyone is out there waiting for us,

227
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,580
如果食死徒准备伏击我们

228
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:28,690
and I reckon there will be,

229
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:28,690
我觉得他们肯定会来

230
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,860
they won't know which Harry Potter is the real one.

231
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,860
他们分不清哪个才是真正的哈利·波特

232
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,990
The real one?

233
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,990
真正的

234
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,070
I believe you're familiar with this particular brew.

235
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,070
你一定很熟悉这种液体

236
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,110
- No, absolutely not. - I told you he'd take it well.

237
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,110
-不  绝对不行  -我说过他会这反应吧

238
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,527
No, if you think I'm gonna let,

239
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,527
不  如果你们认为

240
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:45,060
everyone risk their lives for me...

241
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:45,060
我会让每个人为我冒生命危险...

242
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,040
We've done if before, mate.

243
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,040
伙计  咱们之前又不是没干过

244
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,540
No, no, this is different.

245
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,540
不  这次不一样

246
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,060
Taking that, becoming me. No!

247
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,060
喝了它  变成我  不行

248
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,960
Well none of us really fancy it, mate.

249
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,960
其实我们才不喜欢呢  伙计

250
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,572
Yeah, imagine if something went wrong,

251
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,572
想象一下  如果出了什么岔子

252
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:55,776
and we be stuck as a screwy

253
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:55,776
我们就永远成为满脸雀斑

254
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:56,610
specky gits, forever.

255
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:56,610
疯疯癫癫的小笨蛋了

256
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,390
Everyone here is of age, Potter.

257
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,390
这里的每个人都成年了  波特

258
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,540
They've all agreed to take the risk.

259
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,540
他们愿意冒这个险

260
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,606
Technically,

261
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,606
准确的说

262
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:06,085
I'd been coerced

263
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:06,085
我是被胁迫的

264
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:07,600
Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter.

265
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:07,600
在下是蒙顿格斯·弗莱彻  波特先生

266
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,380
Always been a huge admirer.

267
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,380
您最忠实的粉丝

268
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,490
Nip it, Mundungus.

269
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,490
闭嘴  蒙顿格斯

270
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,223
Alright Granger, its discussed.

271
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,223
格兰杰小姐  依计而行

272
00:13:14,224 --> 00:13:15,390
Blimey, Hermione!

273
00:13:14,224 --> 00:13:15,390
轻点  赫敏

274
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,080
Straight in here, if you please.

275
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,080
请放进去

276
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,684
For those of you who haven't taken polyjuice potion before,

277
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,684
对于那些没有喝过复方汤剂的人

278
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:31,144
fair warning.

279
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:31,144
给你们一个忠告

280
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:33,080
Tastes like goblin piss.

281
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:33,080
尝起来有点像妖精的尿

282
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,270
Have enough experiences with that, do you, Mad-eye?

283
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,270
你尝尿无数了是吧  疯眼汉

284
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,100
Just trying to defuse the tension.

285
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,100
活跃一下气氛嘛

286
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,269
Wow! We're identical!

287
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,269
咱俩一摸一样

288
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,120
Not yet you're not.

289
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,120
还没完呢

290
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,047
Haven't you got anything a bit more sporting, have you?

291
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,047
你就没有一件运动型的吗

292
00:14:21,722 --> 00:14:23,235
Yeah, I don't really fancy this color.

293
00:14:21,722 --> 00:14:23,235
我不太喜欢这个颜色

294
00:14:23,342 --> 00:14:26,336
Well fancy this, you're not you, so shove it, and strip.

295
00:14:23,342 --> 00:14:26,336
给你你就穿  由不得你了  快换上

296
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,550
Alright, Alright.

297
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,550
好了  好了

298
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,310
You need to change too, Potter.

299
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,310
你也得换  波特

300
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,830
Bill, look away, I'm hideous.

301
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,830
比尔  头扭过去  我丑死了

302
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,652
I knew she was lying about that tattoo.

303
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,652
我就知道她说的那个纹身是假的

304
00:14:35,653 --> 00:14:38,090
Harry, your eyesight really is awful.

305
00:14:35,653 --> 00:14:38,090
哈利  你的视力真是糟透了

306
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,882
All right then, we'll be pairing off.

307
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,882
好了  我们来分组

308
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:41,420
Each Potter will have a protector.

309
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:41,420
每个波特都有一个保护者

310
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,343
Mundungus, stick tight to me.

311
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,343
蒙顿格斯  跟紧我

312
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:45,290
I want to keep an eye on ya.

313
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:45,290
我得盯着点你

314
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,630
- As for Harry... - Yes?

315
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,630
-而哈利... -这

316
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,510
The real Harry. Where the devil are you anyway?

317
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,510
真正的哈利  到底哪个是你

318
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,570
- Here. - You ride with Hagrid.

319
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,570
-在这  -你和海格骑摩托

320
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,541
I brought you here 16 years ago,

321
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,541
我16年前送你来这时

322
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:59,150
when you were no bigger than a bow truckle.

323
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:59,150
你还没有一只小史棘龙大

324
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,019
Seems only right that

325
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,019
看起来

326
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,999
I should be the one that take you away now.

327
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,999
解铃还须系铃人啊

328
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:05,320
Yes, this is all very touching. Let's go!

329
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:05,320
多感人啊  出发了

330
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,090
Head for the Burrows. We rendezvous there.

331
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,090
目的地陋居  到那碰面

332
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,830
- On the count of three! - Hold tight, Harry!

333
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,830
-数到三  -抓紧了  哈利

334
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,640
One!

335
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,640
一

336
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,620
Two!

337
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,620
二

338
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,620
Three!

339
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,620
三

340
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,460
Watch your right!

341
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,460
注意你的右边

342
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,587
Hagrid, we have to help the others!

343
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,587
海格  我们得回去帮他们

344
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:28,990
Can't do that, Harry.

345
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:28,990
不行  哈利

346
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,720
Mad-Eye's orders.

347
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,720
疯眼汉有命令

348
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,750
Hang on!

349
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,750
抓紧了

350
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,270
Stupefy!

351
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,270
昏昏倒地

352
00:16:58,890 --> 00:16:59,940
Hang on, Harry!

353
00:16:58,890 --> 00:16:59,940
抓紧了  哈利

354
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,280
Hagrid!

355
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,280
海格

356
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,550
No! No!

357
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,550
不  不

358
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,200
Harry!

359
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,200
哈利

360
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,290
Harry! Hagrid!

361
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,290
哈利  海格

362
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,650
What happened?

363
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,650
发生什么事了

364
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,410
Where are the others?

365
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,410
其他人在哪

366
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,760
Is no one else back?

367
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,760
还没人回来吗

368
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,460
They were on us right from the start, Molly.

369
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,460
我们一出发就被食死徒攻击了  莫丽

370
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,170
We didn't stand a chance.

371
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,170
毫无还手之力

372
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,480
Well, thank goodness you two are all right.

373
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,480
谢天谢地你们俩没事

374
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,250
The Death Eaters were waiting for us. It was an ambush.

375
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,250
食死徒一直在等我们  他们早埋伏好了

376
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,490
Ron and Bill should have already been back.

377
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,490
罗恩和比尔早该回来了

378
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,250
Dad and Fred as well.

379
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,250
爸爸和弗雷德也是

380
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,080
Here.

381
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,080
在这

382
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,090
Quick, into the house.

383
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,090
快  进屋

384
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,310
Oh My boy...

385
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,310
我的孩子

386
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,230
- Come here! - What are you doing?

387
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,230
-过来  -你干什么

388
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,453
What creature sat in the corner the

389
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,453
哈利波特在霍格沃兹第一次拜访我的办公室时

390
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:09,500
first time Harry Potter visited my office in Hogwarts.

391
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:09,500
房间角落里的是什么生物

392
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,150
- Are you mad? - What creature?

393
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,150
-你疯了吗  -什么东西

394
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,230
A Grindylow.

395
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,230
一只格林迪洛

396
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,080
We have been betrayed.

397
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,080
我们被出卖了

398
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,670
Voldemort knew you were being moved tonight.

399
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,670
伏地魔知道我们今晚要转移你

400
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,030
I had to make sure, you weren't an imposter.

401
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,030
我得确定你是不是冒牌货

402
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,010
Wait!

403
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,010
等等

404
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:42,860
The last words Albus Dumbledore, spoke to the pair of us.

405
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:42,860
邓不利多最后对我们两个说的什么

406
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,630
"Harry is the best hope we have. "

407
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,630
哈利是我们最大的希望

408
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,980
"Trust him. "

409
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,980
相信他

410
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,680
What gave you away?

411
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,680
你是怎么脱身的

412
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,470
Hedwig, I think.

413
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,470
海德薇来了

414
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,100
She was trying to protect me.

415
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,100
她想保护我

416
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,560
Thanks.

417
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,560
谢谢

418
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,770
He deserves that. Brilliant he was.

419
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,770
你该好好抱抱他  太了不起了

420
00:21:17,771 --> 00:21:20,080
I wouldn't be standing here without him.

421
00:21:17,771 --> 00:21:20,080
要没他我早死了

422
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,600
Really?

423
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,600
真的吗

424
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,160
Why is it so a surprise?

425
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,160
需要这么大惊小怪吗

426
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:37,060
We the last back? Where's George?

427
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:37,060
我们是最后一批吗  乔治呢

428
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,630
How are you feeling, Georgie?

429
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,630
乔治  你感觉怎么样

430
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:06,010
- Saint like. - Come again?

431
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:06,010
-像个圣人  -什么

432
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,750
Saint like.

433
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,750
像个圣人

434
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,062
I'm holey. I'm holey,

435
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,062
我变神圣了  我有洞了

436
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:14,070
Fred! Get it?

437
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:14,070
弗雷德  明白吗

438
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,919
[注: 乔治是指holy和holey的同音双关]

439
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,311
A whole wide world of ear related humor

440
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,311
全世界那么多关于耳朵的笑点

441
00:22:18,364 --> 00:22:20,473
and you go for 'I'm holey".

442
00:22:18,364 --> 00:22:20,473
你偏挑了个"我有洞了"

443
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:22,130
That's pathetic.

444
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:22,130
真衰

445
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,670
Think I'm still better looking than you.

446
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,670
我还是比你帅

447
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,960
Mad-Eye's dead.

448
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,960
疯眼汉死了

449
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,850
Mundungus took one look at Voldemort and disapparated.

450
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,850
蒙顿格斯一看见伏地魔就溜了

451
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,790
Head for the burrow.

452
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,790
目的地陋居

453
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,190
Seven, Seven...

454
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,190
七个  七个

455
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,170
- Horcruxes... - They could be hidden anywhere, couldn't they.

456
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,170
-魂器  -它们可能藏在任何地方  对吗

457
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,570
To tear the soul into seven pieces...

458
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,570
灵魂裂于七块

459
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,451
If we destroy the Horcruxes.

460
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,451
如果我们摧毁了所有的魂器

461
00:23:20,452 --> 00:23:21,760
One destroys, Voldemort.

462
00:23:20,452 --> 00:23:21,760
就能最终击败伏地魔

463
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,550
Harry...

464
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,550
哈利

465
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:31,730
- Do not lie to me. Do not lie to me. - No!

466
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:31,730
-不要骗我  不要骗我  -不可以

467
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,890
Going somewhere?

468
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,890
你要去哪

469
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,710
Nobody else is going to die.

470
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,710
再不会有人牺牲了

471
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
Not for me.

472
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
为我而牺牲

473
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,570
For you?

474
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,570
为了你

475
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,290
You think Mad-Eye died for you?

476
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,290
你以为疯眼汉为你而死

477
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,890
You think George took that curse for you?

478
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,890
你以为乔治为你而伤

479
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,930
You maybe the chosen one, mate...

480
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,930
也许你就是那个救世主

481
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,060
but this is a whole lot bigger than that.

482
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,060
这才是最重要的

483
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,000
Its always been bigger than that.

484
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,000
这比什么都重要

485
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,450
- Come with me. - And leave Hermione?

486
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,450
-跟我来吧  -撇下赫敏吗

487
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,540
Are you mad?

488
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,540
你疯了吗

489
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,850
We wouldn't last two days, without her.

490
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,850
没有她咱们撑不了两天

491
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,870
Don't tell her I said that.

492
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,870
别跟她说我说过这话

493
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,644
Besides, you still got the trace on you,

494
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,644
而且  你身上还带着踪丝

495
00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:46,505
you still got the wedding...

496
00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:46,505
你还得参加婚礼

497
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,010
I don't care about a wedding.

498
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,010
我不在乎一个婚礼

499
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,749
I'm sorry, no matter whose it is.

500
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,749
抱歉  不管是谁的婚礼

501
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,100
I have to start finding these Horcruxes.

502
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,100
我必须开始寻找魂器

503
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,880
They're our only chance, to beat him.

504
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,880
那是我们唯一击败他的机会

505
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:00,080
And the longer we stay here, the stronger he gets.

506
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:00,080
而我们在这待得越久  他就会越强大

507
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,860
Tonight is not the night, mate.

508
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,860
伙计  今晚还不是时候

509
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,540
You'll only be doing him a favor.

510
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,540
只会正中他的下怀

511
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,300
Do you think he knows?

512
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,300
你觉得他知道吗

513
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:40,260
I mean they are bits of his soul, these Horcruxes.

514
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:40,260
那些魂器是他的灵魂碎片

515
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,930
Pieces of him.

516
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,930
是他的一部分

517
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,630
When Dumbledore destroyed the Ring,

518
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,630
当邓布利多毁了那枚戒指

519
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,720
you destroyed Tom Riddle's Diary.

520
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,720
当你摧毁汤姆·里德尔的日记的时候

521
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,970
He must have felt something.

522
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,970
他肯定能感到些什么

523
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,370
To kill the other Horcruxes, we have to find them.

524
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,370
要毁掉剩下的魂器  得先找到它们

525
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,940
Where are they?

526
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,940
它们在哪

527
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,540
Where do we start?

528
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,540
我们从何处着手

529
00:26:04,285 --> 00:26:07,540
比尔和芙蓉

530
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:15,690
丽塔·斯基特新着《邓布利多的黑暗面》

531
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,352
追忆邓布利多
作者:埃非亚斯·多吉

532
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,690
Zip me up, will you?

533
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,690
帮我拉上好吗

534
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,250
It seems silly doesn't it, a wedding?

535
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,250
看起来很傻吧  我是说举办婚礼

536
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,360
Given what's going on.

537
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,360
发生了这么多事情

538
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,020
Maybe that's the best reason to have it.

539
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,020
可能这就是举行婚礼最好的理由

540
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,510
Because of everything that's going on.

541
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,510
一切还要继续

542
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,770
Morning.

543
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,770
早啊

544
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,800
All together now!

545
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,800
各就各位

546
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:42,150
One! Two! Three!

547
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:42,150
一  二  三

548
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,440
How it looking your end, boys?

549
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,440
你们那边怎么样了  小伙子们

550
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,120
Brilliant.

551
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,120
很好

552
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:03,850
Bloody, hell. What's the Minister of Magic doing here?

553
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:03,850
妈的  魔法部长来搞毛

554
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,650
To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister?

555
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,650
部长大人来此有何贵干

556
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,640
I think we both know the answer to that question, Mr. Potter.

557
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,640
这个问题你我都心知肚明  波特先生

558
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,400
This is?

559
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,400
这是什么

560
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:35,544
Herein it is set forth,

561
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:35,544
现在我将宣读

562
00:28:35,545 --> 00:28:38,930
the last will and testament of,

563
00:28:35,545 --> 00:28:38,930
阿布思·珀西瓦尔·伍尔弗里克·布赖恩·邓布利多

564
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,540
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.

565
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,540
最后的遗嘱

566
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:48,240
"First, to Ronald Billius Weasley,

567
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:48,240
首先  我要把熄灯器留给

568
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,920
I leave my deluminlator. "

569
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,920
罗恩·比利斯·韦斯莱

570
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,180
"A device, of my own making,

571
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,180
这是我自己做的一个小东西

572
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:59,210
In the hope, that when things seem most dark...

573
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:59,210
希望它能在最黑暗的时候

574
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,990
It will show him the light. "

575
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,990
给罗恩带来光明

576
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,330
- Dumbledore left this for me? - Yeah.

577
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,330
-邓布利多把这个留给我  -是的

578
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,040
Brilliant.

579
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,040
太棒了

580
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,930
- What is it? - Open it.

581
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,930
-这怎么使  -打开它

582
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,700
Wicked.

583
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,700
太帅了

584
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,610
"To Hermione Jean Granger,

585
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,610
将我珍藏的《诗翁彼豆故事集》

586
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:42,660
I leave my copy of 'The Tales of Beedle the Bard'."

587
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:42,660
留给赫敏·简·格兰杰

588
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:47,390
"In the hope that she find it entertaining and instructive "

589
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:47,390
希望她能从书中找到乐趣和启发

590
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,800
My mom used to read me those.

591
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,800
我妈以前常给我读

592
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,553
The wizard and the hopping pot,

593
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,553
精灵和魔力壶

594
00:29:52,554 --> 00:29:54,570
Babbity Rabbity and the Cackling Stump.

595
00:29:52,554 --> 00:29:54,570
芭比兔与话唠树桩

596
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,630
Come on. Babbity Rabbity.

597
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,630
得了  芭比兔啊

598
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,970
No?

599
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,970
没听过吗

600
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,770
"To Harry James Potter

601
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,770
哈利·詹姆斯·波特

602
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,874
I leave the snitch he caught

603
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,874
将得到这只金色飞贼"

604
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:09,027
"in his first

605
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:09,027
这是他在霍格沃茨

606
00:30:09,028 --> 00:30:10,180
Quidditch match at Hogwarts.

607
00:30:09,028 --> 00:30:10,180
第一次参加魁地奇比赛时抓到的

608
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:14,600
As a reminder of the rewards of perseverance...

609
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:14,600
以时刻提醒他

610
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,550
and skill. "

611
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,550
毅力和技巧的回报

612
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,670
Is that it then?

613
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,670
就这些吗

614
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,290
Not quite.

615
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,290
还没

616
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:45,020
Dumbledore left you,

617
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:45,020
邓布利多还留给你

618
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,460
a second bequest.

619
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,460
第二件遗物

620
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,610
The sword of Godric Gryffindor.

621
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,610
戈德里克·格兰芬多之剑

622
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,676
Unfortunately, the sword of Gryffindor

623
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,676
很不幸  邓布利多没有权利

624
00:30:54,677 --> 00:30:57,020
was not Dumbledore's to give away.

625
00:30:54,677 --> 00:30:57,020
将格兰芬多之剑赠予他人

626
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,090
As an important historical artifact it belongs...

627
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,090
作为一件贵重的历史文物  它属于...

628
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,180
to Harry.

629
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,180
哈利

630
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,750
It belongs to Harry.

631
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,750
它属于哈利

632
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,830
It came to him when he most needed it

633
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,830
在密室里  当哈利最需要的时刻

634
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:07,410
in the Chamber of Secrets.

635
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:07,410
它选择了哈利

636
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,164
The sword may present itself

637
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,164
每当遇到格莱芬多的杰出学生时

638
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:11,110
to any worthy Gryffindor, Miss Granger,

639
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:11,110
宝剑就会出现  格兰杰小姐

640
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,510
that does not make it that wizards property.

641
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,510
这并不表示它属于那个人

642
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:15,819
And in any event,

643
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:15,819
更何况

644
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:18,480
the current whereabouts of the sword are unknown.

645
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:18,480
现在没人知道宝剑在哪

646
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,760
Excuse me?

647
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,760
你说什么

648
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,200
The Sword is Missing.

649
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,200
剑不见了

650
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:25,990
I don't know what you are up, to, Mr. Potter,

651
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:25,990
我不知道你接下来要做什么  波特先生

652
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:29,630
but you can't fight this war on your own.

653
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:29,630
但你不能单打独斗

654
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,360
He's too strong.

655
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,360
他太强大了

656
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,560
Hello, Harry.

657
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,560
你好  哈利

658
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,460
I've interrupted your deep thoughts, haven't I?

659
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,460
我打扰了你的沉思吗

660
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,220
I see it growing small in your eyes.

661
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,220
我从你的眼睛里看得出来的

662
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,950
Of course not. How are you, Luna?

663
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,950
当然没有  你好吗  卢娜

664
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,685
Very well,

665
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,685
很好

666
00:32:42,788 --> 00:32:45,020
I've been bitten by garden a gnome and numbed my thumb.

667
00:32:42,788 --> 00:32:45,020
我被地精咬了一口  大拇指失去知觉了

668
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,170
Gnome saliva is very beneficial.

669
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,170
地精唾液可大有裨益哦

670
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,733
Xenophilius Lovegood.

671
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,733
谢诺菲留斯·洛夫古德

672
00:32:48,785 --> 00:32:49,710
We live just over the heel.

673
00:32:48,785 --> 00:32:49,710
我们住在山上

674
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,830
Nice to meet you, sir.

675
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,830
很高兴见到你  先生

676
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,680
I trust you know Mr. Potter that we at the Quibbler,

677
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,680
相信波特先生知道我们的《唱唱反调》

678
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,943
disagree with the Daily Prophet,

679
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,943
跟《预言家日报》对着干

680
00:32:54,944 --> 00:32:58,070
and have always fully supported Dumbledore...

681
00:32:54,944 --> 00:32:58,070
我们在邓布利多在世时和他去世后

682
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:02,210
during his lifetime and in his death, support you just as fully.

683
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:02,210
都全力支持他  也全力支持你

684
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,530
Thank you.

685
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,530
谢谢

686
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:08,130
Come Daddy. Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now.

687
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:08,130
好了爸爸  哈利现在不想跟我们说话

688
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,710
He's just too polite to say so.

689
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,710
他只是怕有失礼貌

690
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,680
Excuse me, sir.

691
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,680
抱歉  先生

692
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,300
- May I sit down? - Mr. Potter.

693
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,300
-我能坐吗  -波特先生

694
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:22,140
By all means, here.

695
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:22,140
请便

696
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,302
I found what you wrote in the Daily Prophet,

697
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,302
我看了你在预言家日报上写的文章

698
00:33:28,497 --> 00:33:29,289
really moving.

699
00:33:28,497 --> 00:33:29,289
非常感人

700
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,580
You obviously knew Dumbledore well.

701
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,580
你一定  很了解邓布利多吧

702
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,110
Well, I certainly knew him the longest.

703
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,110
我认识他的时间最长了

704
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,270
Unless we don't count his brother Aberforth,

705
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,270
除了他弟弟阿不福思外

706
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,340
and somehow people never do seem to count, Aberforth.

707
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,340
不过  好像从没人记起过阿不福思

708
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,230
I didn't even know he had a brother.

709
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,230
我都不知道他还有个弟弟

710
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,860
Dumbledore was always very private, even as a boy.

711
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,860
邓布利多一直独来独往  从小就是

712
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:50,100
Do not despair, Elphias.

713
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:50,100
别惆怅了  埃菲亚斯

714
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:54,520
I'm told he's been thoroughly unrevealed by Rita Skeeter.

715
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:54,520
丽塔·斯基特曝光了他的一切

716
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,850
In 800 pages.

717
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,850
书有800页厚呢

718
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,537
Word has it

719
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,537
据说

720
00:33:59,749 --> 00:34:02,134
that someone talked to her.

721
00:33:59,749 --> 00:34:02,134
有人向她透露了些秘密

722
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,670
Someone who knew the Dumbledore family well.

723
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,670
一个与邓布利多家族关系密切的人

724
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,380
Both you and I know who that is, Elphias.

725
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,380
咱俩都知道这指的是谁吧  埃菲亚斯

726
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,540
A monstrous betrayal.

727
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,540
这是可耻的背叛

728
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:15,040
Who are, who are we talking about?

729
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:15,040
这个  这个人是谁啊

730
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,290
Bathilda Bagshot.

731
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,290
巴希尔达·巴肖特

732
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:20,588
Who?

733
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:20,588
谁

734
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:22,444
My god, boy. She is only the most...

735
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:22,444
天哪  孩子  她可是

736
00:34:22,455 --> 00:34:25,861
celebrated magical historian of the last century.

737
00:34:22,455 --> 00:34:25,861
上个世纪最着名的魔法史家

738
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,630
She was as close to the Dumbledore's as anyone.

739
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,630
还是邓布利多的老朋友

740
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,968
Oh, I'm sure Rita Skeeter

741
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,968
丽塔·斯基特肯定觉得

742
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:37,250
thought it well worth a trip to Godric's Hollow,

743
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:37,250
很值得去一趟戈德里克山谷

744
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,650
to take a peek into that old bird's records cage.

745
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,650
拜访一下那个老不啦叽的女人

746
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,970
Godric's Hollow?

747
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,970
戈德里克山谷

748
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,320
Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric's Hallow?

749
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,320
巴希尔达·巴肖特住在戈德里克山谷吗

750
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,600
That's where she first met, Dumbledore.

751
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,600
她就是在那认识邓布利多的

752
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,150
You don't mean to say he lived there too.

753
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,150
你不会是说邓布利多也住在那吧

754
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,830
The family moved there

755
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,830
他爸爸杀了那三个麻瓜后

756
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,670
after his father killed those three Muggles.

757
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,670
全家就搬了过去

758
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,070
It was quite the scandal.

759
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,070
那可是当时很大的丑闻

760
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:59,290
Honestly my boy,

761
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:59,290
孩子  说真的

762
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,880
are you sure you knew him at all?

763
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,880
你真的了解邓布利多吗

764
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,300
Ministry has fallen.

765
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,300
魔法部垮台了

766
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:35,900
Minister of Magic, is dead.

767
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:35,900
魔法部长死了

768
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,030
They are coming.

769
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,030
他们来了

770
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,460
They are coming.

771
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,460
他们来了

772
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,150
Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter.

773
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,150
后会有期了  波特先生

774
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,470
Ginny!

775
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,470
金妮

776
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,890
Go! Go!

777
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,890
快走  快走

778
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,570
Where are we?

779
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,570
我们这是在哪

780
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,100
Shaftesbury Avenue.

781
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,100
舍夫茨别利路

782
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,340
I used to come up here to theaters with mom and dad.

783
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,340
我以前常和爸妈来这看戏

784
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,320
I don't know why I thought of it. It just popped into my head.

785
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,320
我也不知道怎么想到的  它突然就蹦了出来

786
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,010
This way.

787
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,010
这边

788
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,370
We need to change.

789
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,370
我们得换身衣服

790
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:47,810
Bloody Hell

791
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:47,810
活见鬼了

792
00:36:47,811 --> 00:36:52,810
- Undetectable Extension charm. - You're amazing, you are.

793
00:36:47,811 --> 00:36:52,810
-空间扩增咒  -你真厉害

794
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,340
Always a total surprise.

795
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,340
生活充满着惊喜

796
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:59,340
Ah, that'll be the books.

797
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:59,340
剩下的就是那堆书了

798
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,150
What about all the people at the wedding?

799
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,150
婚礼上的人怎么办

800
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,005
Do you think that we should go back?

801
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,005
我们是不是该回去看看

802
00:37:09,056 --> 00:37:10,100
They're after you, mate.

803
00:37:09,056 --> 00:37:10,100
伙计  他们冲你来的

804
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,154
We'd put everyone in danger by going back.

805
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,154
回去的话  大家都会有危险

806
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,690
- Ron's right. - Coffee

807
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,690
-罗恩说的对  -要什么咖啡

808
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,110
- A cappuccino please - You?

809
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,110
-一杯卡布奇诺  -你呢

810
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,240
- What she said. - Same.

811
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,240
-和她一样  -一样

812
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,370
So where do we go from here? Leaky Cauldron.

813
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,370
那我们现在去哪  破釜酒吧

814
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,000
It's too dangerous.

815
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,000
太危险了

816
00:37:35,568 --> 00:37:37,224
If Voldemort has taken over the Ministry,

817
00:37:35,568 --> 00:37:37,224
如果伏地魔控制了魔法部

818
00:37:37,313 --> 00:37:38,757
none of the old places are safe.

819
00:37:37,313 --> 00:37:38,757
就没哪是安全的了

820
00:37:38,792 --> 00:37:42,010
Everyone from the wedding would have gone underground, into hiding.

821
00:37:38,792 --> 00:37:42,010
婚礼上的人也都该躲起来了

822
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,920
My rucksack with all my things. I've left it at the burrow.

823
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,920
我的包还在陋居  东西都在里面

824
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,910
You're joking.

825
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,910
你开玩笑吧

826
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:57,360
I had the essentials, packed for days. Just in case.

827
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:57,360
我几天前就把必需品装包里了  以防万一

828
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,440
By the way, why're the jeans not my favourite?

829
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,440
对了  我最喜欢的牛仔裤怎么没带上

830
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,170
Down!

831
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,170
趴下

832
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,231
Stupify!

833
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,231
昏昏倒地

834
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,786
Petrificus Totalus!

835
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,786
统统石化

836
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,950
Go! Leave.

837
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,950
快走  离开这

838
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,870
Lock the door, get the lights.

839
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,870
锁上门  熄掉灯

840
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,019
This one's names Rawl.

841
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,019
这个是罗尔

842
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:50,600
He was on the astronomy tower the last night they killed Dumbledore.

843
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:50,600
邓布利多被杀的那晚  他也在占星塔上

844
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,439
This is Dolohov.

845
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,439
这个是多罗霍夫

846
00:38:54,219 --> 00:38:56,060
I recognize him from the wanted notice.

847
00:38:54,219 --> 00:38:56,060
我在通缉布告上见过

848
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,880
So what we're gonna do with you, eh?

849
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,880
怎么处置你们呢

850
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,480
Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn't you?

851
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,480
反过来  你们会杀了我们对吧

852
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,410
We kill them, they'll know we were here.

853
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,410
杀了他们的话  食死徒就知道我们在哪了

854
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:09,810
- Ron. - Suppose he did Mad-eye? How would you feel then?

855
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:09,810
-罗恩  -没准是他杀的疯眼汉呢  你还那么想吗

856
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,500
It's better we wipe their memories.

857
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,500
抹去他们的记忆吧

858
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:21,130
You're the boss. Hermione.

859
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:21,130
你说了算  赫敏

860
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:22,870
You're the best with spells.

861
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:22,870
魔咒什么的你最拿手

862
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,040
Obliviate.

863
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,040
一忘皆空

864
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,610
How is it they knew we were there?

865
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,610
他们怎么找到我们的

866
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,210
Maybe you still have the trace on you?

867
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,210
你可能还带着踪丝

868
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,120
They can't, the trace stays until I'm seventeen year's old.

869
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,120
不可能  十七岁踪丝就消失了

870
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,512
What?

871
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,512
怎么了

872
00:40:07,096 --> 00:40:08,932
We didn't celebrate your birthday, Harry.

873
00:40:07,096 --> 00:40:08,932
我们还没给你过生日呢  哈利

874
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,230
Ginny and I, we prepared a cake.

875
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,230
我和金妮还准备了个蛋糕

876
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,220
We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding.

877
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,220
我们准备在婚礼结束时拿出来

878
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,404
Hermione, honestly,

879
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,404
赫敏  说真的

880
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:18,237
I appreciate the thought,

881
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:18,237
你的好意我心领了

882
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:20,157
but really given the fact, that we were almost killed

883
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:20,157
但是看看刚才  我们差点被几个食死徒杀了

884
00:40:20,173 --> 00:40:22,090
by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago.

885
00:40:20,173 --> 00:40:22,090
还是先别想这个了吧

886
00:40:24,718 --> 00:40:28,318
Right... perspective.

887
00:40:24,718 --> 00:40:28,318
也是  说的对

888
00:40:28,353 --> 00:40:30,084
We have to get off the streets, get to someplace safe.

889
00:40:28,353 --> 00:40:30,084
咱们别在街上晃悠了  找个安全的地方

890
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,940
What was that all about?

891
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,940
刚才那是什么

892
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,960
Probably Mad-Eye's idea.

893
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,960
应该是疯眼汉的主意吧

894
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,270
In case Snape decides to come snooping.

895
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,270
防止斯内普偷摸进来

896
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,060
Homenum Revelio.

897
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,060
人形显身

898
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,250
We're alone.

899
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,250
没有别人了

900
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,010
Another wand!

901
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,010
换一根魔杖

902
00:41:46,241 --> 00:41:49,518
I believe a different wand would work? I swear.

903
00:41:46,241 --> 00:41:49,518
我发誓  再换一根就行了

904
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:52,810
It should be another way.

905
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:52,810
应该有别的方法

906
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,540
Harry, where are you?

907
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,540
哈利  你在哪

908
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,010
Is it dark up there?

909
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,010
上面黑吗

910
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:16,980
Lovely.

911
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:16,980
还不错嘛

912
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:25,490
Regulus Arcturus Black

913
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:25,490
雷古勒斯·阿克图勒斯·布莱克

914
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:27,460
R.A.B.

915
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:27,460
R.A.B

916
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:34,380
"I know I will be dead long before you read this. "

917
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:34,380
在你读到这个之时  我早已死去

918
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:38,450
"I have stolen the real horcrux and intend to destroy it. "

919
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:38,450
我偷走了真的魂器  并想销毁它

920
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,220
R.A.B, he was Sirius' brother?

921
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,220
R.A.B  是小天狼星的弟弟吗

922
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,040
Yes.

923
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,040
对

924
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:49,500
The question is he didn't actually destroy the real Horcrux.

925
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:49,500
但问题是他没能摧毁真正的魂器

926
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,920
Spying on us, have you.

927
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,920
你一直暗中监视我们

928
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:18,720
Kreacher, has been watching.

929
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:18,720
克利切  一直在旁观

930
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:20,410
Maybe he knows where the real locket is?

931
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:20,410
也许他知道真的魂器在哪

932
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:26,930
Have you ever seen this before? Kreacher?

933
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:26,930
你以前见过这个东西吗  克利切

934
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:33,420
- It is Master Regulus's locket! - There were two, weren't there?

935
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:33,420
-是雷古勒斯少爷的挂坠盒  -当时有两个  对不对

936
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,060
Where's the other one?

937
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,060
另一个呢

938
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,850
Kreacher doesn't know, about the other locket.

939
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,850
克利切不知道另一个挂坠盒在哪

940
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,860
Yes, but did you ever see it? It was in this house.

941
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,860
但你以前见过吗  它就在这所房子里

942
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:50,170
Filthy mudblood that's what you are, Blood traitor Weasley!

943
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:50,170
肮脏的泥巴种  还有血统背叛者韦斯莱

944
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,700
Answer her.

945
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,700
回答她的问题

946
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,077
Yes.

947
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,077
见过

948
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,290
It was here,

949
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,290
它曾经就在这里

950
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:00,829
in this house.

951
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:00,829
在这屋中

952
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:03,906
Most evil object.

953
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:03,906
这邪恶的物件

954
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:05,880
How do you mean?

955
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:05,880
什么意思

956
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:11,470
Before Master Regulus died, he ordered Kreacher to destroy,

957
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:11,470
雷古勒斯少爷死前  命令克利切销毁它

958
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:15,550
but no matter how hard Kreacher tried, he could not do it.

959
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:15,550
但试遍了所有的办法都不行

960
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:18,350
Well, where is it now?

961
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:18,350
现在在哪

962
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,210
- Did someone take it? - He came in the night.

963
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,210
-有人拿走了吗  -他那天晚上来到这

964
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:29,080
He took many things including the locket.

965
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:29,080
连带着挂坠盒拿走了很多东西

966
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,840
Who did? Who was it, Kreacher?

967
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,840
谁  谁拿走的  克利切

968
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:36,440
Mundungus.

969
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:36,440
蒙顿格斯

970
00:45:37,388 --> 00:45:40,388
Mundungus Fletcher.

971
00:45:37,388 --> 00:45:40,388
蒙顿格斯·弗莱奇

972
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:43,360
Find him.

973
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:43,360
找到他

974
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,880
My father will hear about this.

975
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,880
我爸饶不了你们

976
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:16,060
Hey losers. He isn't here.

977
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:16,060
饭桶们  他不在这

978
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:29,310
哈利波特:头号不良分子

979
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:32,110
As your new Minister for Magic,

980
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:32,110
作为你们的新任魔法部长

981
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:37,310
I promise to restore this temple of tolerance

982
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:37,310
我承诺将给这恢弘的大厅

983
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:39,870
to its former glory.

984
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:39,870
带回往昔的荣耀

985
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:42,770
魔法即强权

986
00:46:41,209 --> 00:46:42,922
Therefore beginning today,

987
00:46:41,209 --> 00:46:42,922
因此从今天开始

988
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,916
each employee will submit themselves,

989
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,916
每位职员都必须接受

990
00:46:48,313 --> 00:46:49,761
for evaluation.

991
00:46:48,313 --> 00:46:49,761
血统评估

992
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:55,080
But know this, you have nothing to fear,

993
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:55,080
记住  如果你没什么可隐瞒的

994
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,310
if you have nothing to hide.

995
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,310
就应无所畏惧

996
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,330
They have flesh memories.

997
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,330
金色飞贼有肉体记忆

998
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,453
When Scrimgeour first gave it to you,

999
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,453
斯克林杰给你的时候

1000
00:48:01,177 --> 00:48:03,370
I thought, it might open at to your touch.

1001
00:48:01,177 --> 00:48:03,370
我还想  它一碰到你的手就会打开

1002
00:48:04,938 --> 00:48:07,610
That Dumbledore hidden something inside it.

1003
00:48:04,938 --> 00:48:07,610
邓布利多可能在里面藏了什么东西

1004
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:22,530
Harry Potter, how long it's been!

1005
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:22,530
哈利·波特  好久不见了啊

1006
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,630
Get off me!

1007
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,630
滚开

1008
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,630
Expelliarmus!

1009
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,630
除你武器

1010
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,800
What you playing at?

1011
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,800
你们玩得什么把戏

1012
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:38,880
Setting a pair of bleeding house elves after me?

1013
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:38,880
派一对家养小精灵跟踪我吗

1014
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:40,683
Dobby was only trying to help.

1015
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:40,683
多比只是想帮忙

1016
00:48:40,948 --> 00:48:43,385
When Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley,

1017
00:48:40,948 --> 00:48:43,385
多比在对角巷看到克利切的时候

1018
00:48:43,514 --> 00:48:45,374
Which Dobby thought was curious.

1019
00:48:43,514 --> 00:48:45,374
多比很好奇他怎么会来这里

1020
00:48:45,535 --> 00:48:49,970
And then Dobby heard Kreacher mention Harry Potter's name.

1021
00:48:45,535 --> 00:48:49,970
然后多比就听到他提到哈利·波特

1022
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:54,190
And then Dobby saw Kreacher talking with the thief.

1023
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:54,190
之后多比看到克利切和那个贼说话

1024
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,093
Not a thief? You foul little...

1025
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,093
你才是贼  你这小...

1026
00:48:57,826 --> 00:48:58,658
git.

1027
00:48:57,826 --> 00:48:58,658
杂种

1028
00:48:59,371 --> 00:49:03,620
I'm a purveyor of rare and wondrous objects.

1029
00:48:59,371 --> 00:49:03,620
我只是转手一些珍贵奇妙的玩意

1030
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,400
You're a thief, Dung, everyone knows it.

1031
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,400
你就是个贼  顿格  大家都知道

1032
00:49:05,493 --> 00:49:10,054
- Master Weasley, so good to see you. - Like your shoes.

1033
00:49:05,493 --> 00:49:10,054
-韦斯莱少爷  见到你真高兴  -鞋子不错

1034
00:49:11,763 --> 00:49:14,060
Listen, I panicked that night, alright?

1035
00:49:11,763 --> 00:49:14,060
听着  我那天晚上紧张极了

1036
00:49:16,348 --> 00:49:18,683
Can't help it if Mad-Eye fell off his broom.

1037
00:49:16,348 --> 00:49:18,683
疯眼汉跌落扫帚  我有什么办法

1038
00:49:20,513 --> 00:49:21,739
- You. - Tell the truth.

1039
00:49:20,513 --> 00:49:21,739
-你  -说实话

1040
00:49:21,766 --> 00:49:23,127
When you turned this place over,

1041
00:49:21,766 --> 00:49:23,127
你把这翻个底朝天的时候

1042
00:49:23,354 --> 00:49:24,140
don't deny it,

1043
00:49:23,354 --> 00:49:24,140
别说没有

1044
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:26,507
you found a locket, am I right?

1045
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:26,507
找到了个挂坠盒  对吗

1046
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:28,818
Why, was it valuable?

1047
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:28,818
怎么了  很值钱吗

1048
00:49:29,036 --> 00:49:32,347
- So, was it? - He's worried he didn't get enough money for it.

1049
00:49:29,036 --> 00:49:32,347
-是吗  -他担心卖的钱太少了吧

1050
00:49:32,915 --> 00:49:34,692
Bleeding give it away, didn't I?

1051
00:49:32,915 --> 00:49:34,692
我可是忍痛割爱了

1052
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:38,731
There I was plogging my wares in Diagon alley,

1053
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:38,731
那天我在对角巷兜售货物

1054
00:49:39,255 --> 00:49:42,208
when some Ministry hag comes up and asks to see me license.

1055
00:49:39,255 --> 00:49:42,208
突然有个魔法部的女巫过来要看我的许可证

1056
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:44,970
Says she the one would lock me up.

1057
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:44,970
说没有的话就把我关起来

1058
00:49:45,794 --> 00:49:49,258
Would have done too, if she hadn't taken a fancy to that locket.

1059
00:49:45,794 --> 00:49:49,258
要不是她突然看上那个挂坠盒  我就真被关起来了

1060
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:51,660
Who was it? The witch, do you know her?

1061
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:51,660
是谁  你认识她吗

1062
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:52,940
Know her?

1063
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:52,940
认识

1064
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,900
She's there. Look.

1065
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,900
就是她  瞧

1066
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,500
Bleedin' bone who.

1067
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,500
绝对没错

1068
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:13,500
魔法部寻求教育改革

1069
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,390
Right, remember what we said.

1070
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,390
好了  记住我们之前说好的

1071
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:54,220
Don't speak to anyone, unless absolutely necessary.

1072
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:54,220
除非迫不得已  不要跟任何人说话

1073
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:57,160
Just, try and act normal.

1074
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:57,160
尽量表现得正常点

1075
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:59,720
Do what everybody else is doing.

1076
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:59,720
依葫芦画瓢

1077
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,870
If we do that and with a bit of luck we'll get inside.

1078
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,870
这样运气好的话  我们就能进去了

1079
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,180
- And then... - It gets really tricky.

1080
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,180
-然后  -随机应变了

1081
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,890
Correct.

1082
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,890
没错

1083
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:10,410
- This is completely mental. - Completely.

1084
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:10,410
-这真是疯了  -没错

1085
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:13,690
The world's mental. Come on.

1086
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:13,690
世界本疯癫  喝吧

1087
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:16,330
We have a Horcrux to find.

1088
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:16,330
我们要去找魂器

1089
00:51:39,543 --> 00:51:42,495
男厕所

1090
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:13,050
We flush ourselves in.

1091
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:13,050
得把自己冲进去

1092
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,350
Its bloody disgusting.

1093
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,350
恶心死了

1094
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:54,660
- You, come along. - What, what?

1095
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:54,660
-你  过来  -怎么了

1096
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:56,780
What did I do?

1097
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:56,780
我怎什么了

1098
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,900
- Are those...? - Muggles.

1099
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,900
-那些是  -麻瓜

1100
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:11,190
In their... rightful place.

1101
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:11,190
在他们该待的地方

1102
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,330
Got to tell you, I'm starting to freak out a bit.

1103
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,330
说实话  我有点崩溃了

1104
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:22,930
How long did you say this batch of polyjuice will last, Hermione?

1105
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:22,930
你说这个复方汤剂药效有多久来着  赫敏

1106
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,680
I didn't.

1107
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,680
不知道

1108
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,940
Cattermole.

1109
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,940
卡特莫尔

1110
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,830
Its still raining inside my office. Its two days now.

1111
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,830
我办公室还在下雨呢  两天了

1112
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:42,540
Have you tried an umbrella?

1113
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:42,540
试过撑把伞吗

1114
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:46,450
Do you realize I'm going downstairs don't you, Cattermole?

1115
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:46,450
你知道我正要去楼下吧  卡特莫尔

1116
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:50,420
- Downstairs? - To interrogate your wife.

1117
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:50,420
-楼下  -审问你妻子

1118
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,640
Now if my wife's blood status were in doubt,

1119
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,640
如果有人怀疑我妻子的血统

1120
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:57,534
and the Head of Department

1121
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:57,534
同时魔法部

1122
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:00,410
of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing,

1123
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:00,410
法律执行司的头有个活要做

1124
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:04,110
I think I might just make that a priority.

1125
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:04,110
我一定会把它当做头等大事去办

1126
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:07,140
You have one hour.

1127
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:07,140
给你一个小时

1128
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:21,740
Oh my god, what am I gonna do?

1129
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:21,740
天啊  我该怎么办

1130
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:24,350
My wife's all alone downstairs.

1131
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:24,350
我妻子一人在楼下

1132
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,700
Ron, you don't have a wife.

1133
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,700
罗恩  你哪来的妻子

1134
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,700
Oh right.

1135
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,700
也对

1136
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,700
Level Two.

1137
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,700
第二层

1138
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:34,630
But how do I stop it raining?

1139
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:34,630
但怎么让雨停下来呢

1140
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:36,680
Try "Finite Incantatem".

1141
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:36,680
试试咒立停

1142
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:42,410
This is you, Ron.

1143
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:42,410
你到了  罗恩

1144
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,830
Finite Incantatem, okay.

1145
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,830
咒立停  好的

1146
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,770
And if that doesn't work?

1147
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,770
没效果怎么办

1148
00:55:07,372 --> 00:55:09,398
I say if we don't locate Umbridge within the hour,

1149
00:55:07,372 --> 00:55:09,398
如果一小时内没找到乌姆里奇

1150
00:55:09,478 --> 00:55:11,462
we go find Ron and come back another day.

1151
00:55:09,478 --> 00:55:11,462
那我们就跟罗恩回去  改天再来

1152
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,610
- Deal? - Yes.

1153
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,610
-行吗  -好

1154
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:18,620
Ah, Mafalda. Trevor sent you, did he?

1155
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:18,620
马法尔达  特雷弗派你过来的是吧

1156
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:21,450
Good. We'll go straight down.

1157
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:21,450
很好  我们下楼去

1158
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,900
Albert, weren't you getting out?

1159
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,900
艾伯特  你不出去吗

挂坠盒飞来

1167
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:53,580
All right, all right. Let's calm down.

1168
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:53,580
好了好了  冷静下来

Lets get back to work, please.

继续工作好吗

1171
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:59,150
Calm down.

1172
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:59,150
没事了

1173
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:06,460
Runcorn?

天啊  我都忘你什么样了

1181
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:26,738
Where's Hermione?

赫敏呢

1183
00:58:26,739 --> 00:58:29,980
She's gone down to the court rooms, with Umbridge.

1184
00:58:26,739 --> 00:58:29,980
她跟乌姆里奇到楼下法庭去了

1185
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:37,710
Bloody cold down here.

1186
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:37,710
这里冷死了

1187
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:42,770
I'm half blood. My father, my father was a wizard.

1188
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:42,770

威廉·沃登顿  在这工作30年了

1191
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:48,460
Perhaps you know him. He Always wore a jacket inside out.

1192
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:48,460
你们没准记得  老是反穿夹克的那个

1193
00:58:48,461 --> 00:58:50,067
There must be a mistake.

1194
00:58:48,461 --> 00:58:50,067
一定是弄错了

1195
00:58:50,371 --> 00:58:53,618
Tell the ministry, I must go to work, I'm half blood.

1196
00:58:50,371 --> 00:58:53,618
跟魔法部说  我必须回去工作  我是混血

Yes?

1212
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:45,220
怎么了

1213
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,807
A wand was taken from you upon

1214
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,807
卡特莫尔太太  你今天抵达魔法部时

1215
00:59:47,808 --> 00:59:50,200
your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole

1216
00:59:47,808 --> 00:59:50,200
被收走了一根魔杖

1217
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:52,650
Is this that wand?

1218
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:52,650
是这根吗

1219
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,581
Would you please tell the court,

1220
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,581
能否告诉我们

1221
00:59:56,582 --> 00:59:59,200
from which witch or wizard you took this wand?

1222
00:59:56,582 --> 00:59:59,200
你是从谁那里抢来的

1223
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:01,520
I didn't take it.

1224
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:01,520
我没有抢

1225
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:08,250
I bought it at Diagon Alley, at Ollivanders, when I was 11.

1226
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:08,250
我十一岁的时候在对角巷奥利凡德那买的

1227
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:12,070
It chose me.

1228
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:12,070
它选择了我

1229
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,329
You're lying.

1230
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,329
你在撒谎

1231
01:00:16,761 --> 01:00:21,304
Wands only choose witches, and you are not a witch.

1232
01:00:16,761 --> 01:00:21,304
魔杖只选择巫师  而你不是巫师

1233
01:00:21,339 --> 01:00:22,420
But I am.

1234
01:00:21,339 --> 01:00:22,420
我是

1235
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,120
Tell them, Reg, tell them what I am.

1236
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,120
雷吉  告诉他们我是谁

1237
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:30,650
Reg, tell them who I am.

1238
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:30,650
告诉他们我是巫师

1239
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,780
What on earth are you doing, Albert?

1240
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,780
你究竟想干嘛  艾伯特

1241
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:47,100
You're lying, Dolores.

1242
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:47,100
你在撒谎  多洛雷斯

1243
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:51,720
And one mustn't tell lies.

1244
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:51,720
你不可以撒谎[第五部刻在哈利手背上的话:我不能说谎]

1245
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,110
Stupefy!

1246
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,110
昏昏倒地

1247
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:03,360
Oh, it's Harry Potter!

1248
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:03,360
天哪  是哈利·波特

1249
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,620
It's him isn't it. This is one to tell the kids.

1250
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,620
就是他  这下跟孩子们可有故事讲了

1251
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:24,000
Expecto patronum!

1252
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:24,000
呼神护卫

1253
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:51,800
Mary, go home.

1254
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:51,800
玛丽  回家吧

1255
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:53,949
Get the kids.

1256
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:53,949
带上孩子

1257
01:01:54,969 --> 01:01:55,738
I'll meet you there.

1258
01:01:54,969 --> 01:01:55,738
我去那找你

1259
01:01:55,773 --> 01:01:57,414
We have to get out of the country, understand?

1260
01:01:55,773 --> 01:01:57,414
国内待不下去了  明白吗

1261
01:01:58,374 --> 01:01:59,502
Mary, do as I say.

1262
01:01:58,374 --> 01:01:59,502
玛丽  照我说的做

1263
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:16,080
Mary?

1264
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:16,080
玛丽

1265
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,060
Who's that?

1266
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,060
那是谁

1267
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:24,200
Long story, nice meeting you.

1268
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:24,200
说来话长  见到你真高兴

1269
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:28,700
- Harry Potter. - It's Harry, Harry Potter.

1270
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:28,700
-哈利·波特  -是哈利  哈利·波特

1271
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:07,700
Expelliarmus!

1272
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:07,700
除你武器

1273
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:06,070
Harry, Harry, quickly, in my bag.

1274
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:06,070
哈利  哈利  快点  在我包里

1275
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:08,270
There's a bottle labeled "Essence of Dittany".

1276
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:08,270
有个瓶子上写着白鲜香精

1277
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:16,610
Quickly!

1278
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:16,610
快点

1279
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:19,260
Accio Dittany!

1280
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:19,260
香精飞来

1281
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:23,370
All right, unstopper it.

1282
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:23,370
打开瓶子

1283
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:24,670
Hermione, his arm.

1284
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:24,670
赫敏  他的胳膊

1285
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:26,590
I know, just do it!

1286
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:26,590
我知道  快打开

1287
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:33,320
It's gonna... It's gonna sting a little bit.

1288
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:33,320
可能  可能会有点痛

1289
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:34,220
What happened?

1290
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:34,220
怎么了  我以为

1291
01:04:34,331 --> 01:04:36,090
I thought we were going to go back to Grimmauld Place.

1292
01:04:34,331 --> 01:04:36,090
咱们不是要回格里莫广场的吗

1293
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:39,760
We were. Alright, One more, one more.

1294
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:39,760
确实是  再来一点  再来一点

1295
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:43,990
We were there we were there but, Yaxley had a hold of me,

1296
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:43,990
我们到了  但是亚克斯利抓住了我

1297
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,620
I knew once he'd seen where we were we,

1298
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,620
他一旦知道了咱们去哪

1299
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:47,879
we couldn't stay so,

1300
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:47,879
那地方就没法待了

1301
01:04:48,364 --> 01:04:49,927
I brought us here, but,

1302
01:04:48,364 --> 01:04:49,927
所以我就把你们带到这来了

1303
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,790
Ron got splinched.

1304
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,790
罗恩被分体了[幻影移形失败的后果之一]

1305
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:19,520
Protego Totalum.

1306
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:19,520
统统加护

1307
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:24,500
- Salvio Hexia. - What are you doing?

1308
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:24,500
-平安镇守  -你在干吗

1309
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:26,510
Protective enchantments.

1310
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:26,510
守护魔咒

1311
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:28,507
I don't fancy another visit

1312
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:28,507
我可不想再像舍夫茨别利路那

1313
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:30,540
like the one we had at Shaftesbury Avenue, do you?

1314
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:30,540
碰上几个不速之客了

1315
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:33,450
You can get going on a tent.

1316
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:33,450
你可以把帐篷拿出来

1317
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:34,760
Tent?

1318
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:34,760
帐篷

1319
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:37,430
- Protego Totalum. - Where am I supposed to find a tent?

1320
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:37,430
-统统加护  -帐篷在哪

1321
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:41,370
Repello Muggletum. Muffliato.

1322
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:41,370
麻瓜屏蔽  闭耳塞听

1323
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:53,680
You first.

1324
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:53,680
你先来

1325
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,140
Incendio.

1326
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,140
火焰熊熊

1327
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,470
Expulso!

1328
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,470
飞沙走石

1329
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:30,760
Diffindo!

1330
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:30,760
四分五裂

1331
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:34,040
Reducto!

1332
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:34,040
粉身碎骨

1333
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,110
What are you doing?

1334
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,110
你干嘛

1335
01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:01,900
We have to keep it safe, until we find out how to destroy it.

1336
01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:01,900
在找到毁掉它的方法前  我们得保管好它

1337
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:02,990
Seems strange, mate.

1338
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:02,990
有点奇怪啊  哥们

1339
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:06,130
Dumbledore sent you off to find these Horcruxes,

1340
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:06,130
邓布利多让你去找魂器

1341
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:07,580
but doesn't tell you how to destroy them.

1342
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:07,580
但却没告诉你怎么毁掉它们

1343
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:09,980
Doesn't that bother you?

1344
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:09,980
你不觉得奇怪吗

1345
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,450
You know the spell, Harry.

1346
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,450
你知道那个咒语  哈利

1347
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,910
- Tell me, Gregorovitch. - He stole from me.

1348
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,910
-告诉我  格里戈维奇  -他从我这偷走的

1349
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:03,160
Who was he, the thief?

1350
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:03,160
那小偷是谁

1351
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:09,980
The boy. It was he who took it.

1352
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:09,980
一个男孩  被他拿走了

1353
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:15,020
I never saw it again, I swear on my life.

1354
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:15,020
我再也没见过他  我以生命起誓

1355
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,090
I believe you.

1356
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,090
我相信你

1357
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:24,900
Avada Kedavra!

1358
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:24,900
阿瓦达索命

1359
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:40,940
I thought it stopped.

1360
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:40,940
梦做完了吧

1361
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:44,780
You can't keep letting him in, Harry.

1362
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:44,780
你不能一直让他这样侵入你的大脑

1363
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:51,520
- You-Know-Who has found, Gregorovitch. - The Wand Maker?

1364
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:51,520
-神秘人找到了格里戈维奇  -那个魔杖匠人

1365
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:56,430
He wants something that Gregorovitch used to have.

1366
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:56,430
他想要一个格里戈维奇以前拥有的东西

1367
01:08:57,180 --> 01:09:00,650
I don't know what. But he wants it desperately.

1368
01:08:57,180 --> 01:09:00,650
不知道是什么  但是他迫切地想拿到手

1369
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:04,380
I mean, it's as if his life depends on it.

1370
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:04,380
仿佛那东西承载着他的性命

1371
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:08,990
Don't, it comforts him.

1372
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:08,990
别  有助他恢复

1373
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,420
It sets my teeth on edge.

1374
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,420
让我浑身发毛

1375
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,170
What's he expecting to hear, good news?

1376
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,170
他想听到什么好消息吗

1377
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:17,820
I think he just hopes that he doesn't hear bad news.

1378
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:17,820
他应该只是不想听到坏消息

1379
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:21,940
How long before he can travel?

1380
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:21,940
他还有多久才能移形

1381
01:09:25,050 --> 01:09:28,000
- I.. I'm doing everything I can. - You're not doing enough.

1382
01:09:25,050 --> 01:09:28,000
-我  我尽力了  -还不够

1383
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:32,230
Take it off!

1384
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:32,230
拿下来

1385
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:35,590
I said, Take it off, now!

1386
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:35,590
我说了  马上拿下来

1387
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:49,970
- Better? - Right.

1388
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:49,970
-好点了吗  -嗯

1389
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:55,630
We'll take it in turns, okay?

1390
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:55,630
我们轮流戴吧

1391
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:33,520
Severus Snape voted in as headmaster of Hogwarts.

1392
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:33,520
西弗勒斯·斯内普被选为霍格沃茨魔法学校校长

1393
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:10,563
校长办公室

1394
01:11:10,563 --> 01:11:12,787
西弗勒斯·斯内普

1395
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:39,650
What's that?

1396
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:39,650
等等

1397
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,190
What's that, smell?

1398
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,190
这什么味道

1399
01:12:14,410 --> 01:12:16,340
Whatcha doing? It's heavy.

1400
01:12:14,410 --> 01:12:16,340
你在干嘛  东西沉死了

1401
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:20,730
Oh I'm sorry. Do you want me to carry it?

1402
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:20,730
不好意思  要我帮忙拿吗

1403
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:30,005
Snatchers.

1404
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:30,005
掠夺贼

1405
01:12:31,853 --> 01:12:33,453
Good to know your enchantments work.

1406
01:12:31,853 --> 01:12:33,453
多亏了你的魔法

1407
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:42,550
He could smell it, my perfume.

1408
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:42,550
他闻到了我的香水

1409
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:46,433
I told you,

1410
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:46,433
我告诉过你

1411
01:12:48,003 --> 01:12:49,737
Ron isn't strong enough to apparate.

1412
01:12:48,003 --> 01:12:49,737
罗恩还无法驾驭幻影移形

1413
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,880
Well then, we'll go on foot.

1414
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,880
那我们就走去吧

1415
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:57,085
Only next time, as much as you like your perfume,

1416
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:57,085
下次不管你多想喷香水

1417
01:12:57,086 --> 01:12:58,790
just don't wear any.

1418
01:12:57,086 --> 01:12:58,790
都克制点别用

1419
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:07,100
And now for the names of missing witches and wizards.

1420
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:07,100
现在播报失踪巫师名单

1421
01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:10,279
These are confirmed,

1422
01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:10,279
这些是已确认名单

1423
01:13:11,695 --> 01:13:14,230
thankfully the list is short today.

1424
01:13:11,695 --> 01:13:14,230
所幸的是  今天的名单很短

1425
01:13:16,282 --> 01:13:18,554

He doesn't know what he's doing, does he?

1452
01:13:58,213 --> 01:13:59,750
他不知道自己在做什么  是吗

1453
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:04,410
None of us do.

1454
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:04,410
我们都不清楚

不  你没听懂

Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade.

1476

泥土和铁锈不会沾染剑锋

1477
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:08,240
It only takes in that which makes it stronger.

1478
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:08,240
它只会吸收能增强自己力量的东西

1479

O... kay.

1480

所以呢

1481
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,950
Harry, we've already destroyed one horcrux, right?

1482
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,950
哈利  我们不是已经摧毁了一个魂器吗

1483
01:15:14,670 --> 01:15:16,324

1484
01:15:14,670 --> 01:15:16,324
汤姆·里德尔密室里的日记

1485
01:15:16,325 --> 01:15:18,960
With a basilisk fang.

1486
01:15:16,325 --> 01:15:18,960
用的是蛇怪的毒牙

1487
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,077
If you tell me you've got one of those

1488
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,077
别告诉我你那血迹斑斑的珠绣包里

1489
01:15:20,078 --> 01:15:21,850
in that bloody beaded bag of yours...

1490
01:15:20,078 --> 01:15:21,850
也有根毒牙

1491
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:22,764
Don't you see?

1492
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:22,764
你还不明白吗

1493
01:15:24,196 --> 01:15:25,010
In The Chamber of Secrets,

1494
01:15:24,196 --> 01:15:25,010
在密室里

1495
01:15:25,045 --> 01:15:27,920
you stabbed the Basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor.

1496
01:15:25,045 --> 01:15:27,920
你用格兰芬多剑杀死了蛇怪

1497
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,990
Its blade is impregnated with basilisk venom.

1498
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,990
它的刀刃沾染了蛇怪的毒液

1499
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:33,740
It only takes in that which makes it stronger.

1500
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:33,740
它只会吸收增强自己力量的东西

1501
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:37,100
- Exactly, which is why... - It can destroy Horcruxes.

1502
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:37,100
-对  这就是为什么  -它能摧毁魂器

1503
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:39,510
That's why Dumbledore left it to you in his will.

1504
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:39,510
这就是邓不利多遗嘱的本意

1505
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:43,610
You're brilliant, Hermione. Truly.

1506
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:43,610
你太聪明了  赫敏  真的

1507
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:45,611
Actually, I'm highly logical

1508
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:45,611
其实是因为我的逻辑

1509
01:15:45,612 --> 01:15:48,340
which allows me to slip past extraneous details.

1510
01:15:45,612 --> 01:15:48,340
能让我把无关细节联系起来

1511
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:50,410
And perceive clearly that which others overlook.

1512
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:50,410
而且能观察到别人忽略的东西

1513
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:52,850
Yeah, there is only one problem with this.

1514
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:52,850
是的  但有个问题

1515
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:00,760
The sword was stolen.

1516
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:00,760
剑被偷了

1517
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:05,126
Yeah, I'm still here.

1518
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:05,126
瞧  我还在这

1519
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:06,743
But you two carry on.

1520
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:06,743
你们俩继续

1521
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,110
Don't let me spoil the fun.

1522
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,110
别因为我扫了兴

1523
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:14,264
- What's wrong? - Wrong? Nothing's wrong.

1524
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:14,264
-怎么了  -没怎么啊

1525
01:16:15,161 --> 01:16:16,695
According to you, anyway.

1526
01:16:15,161 --> 01:16:16,695
你想怎样就怎样

1527
01:16:17,094 --> 01:16:19,048
If you got something to say, don't be shy.

1528
01:16:17,094 --> 01:16:19,048
如果你想说什么  别藏着掖着

1529
01:16:20,128 --> 01:16:20,823
Spit it out.

1530
01:16:20,128 --> 01:16:20,823
说出来

1531
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,250
Alright, I'll spit it out.

1532
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,250
那我可就说了

1533
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:25,094
But don't expect me to be grateful

1534
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:25,094
别以为咱们现在要去找另一个鬼玩意了

1535
01:16:25,095 --> 01:16:27,440
just because now it's another damn thing we got to find.

1536
01:16:25,095 --> 01:16:27,440
我就能开心点

1537
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,207
I thought you knew what you signed up for.

1538
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,207
我以为你知道此行的目的

1539
01:16:29,208 --> 01:16:31,437
Yeah, I thought it too.

1540
01:16:29,208 --> 01:16:31,437
我也这么想来着

1541
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:34,840
I'm sorry. But I don't quite understand.

1542
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:34,840
不好意思  我有点不明白

1543
01:16:35,482 --> 01:16:38,294
What part of this isn't living up to your expectations?

1544
01:16:35,482 --> 01:16:38,294
到底哪一点让你不满意了

1545
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:41,324
Did you think we were going to be staying in a five star hotel?

1546
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:41,324
你是不是认为我们该住五星级酒店

1547
01:16:41,325 --> 01:16:42,895
Finding a Horcrux every other day.

1548
01:16:41,325 --> 01:16:42,895
三天打渔两天晒网

1549
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,200
You thought you'd be back with your mum by Christmas?

1550
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,200
你还盼着回家和老妈过圣诞节是吗

1551
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,672
I just thought, after all this time

1552
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,672
我只是觉得  都这么久了

1553
01:16:46,673 --> 01:16:48,980
we would actually have achieved something.

1554
01:16:46,673 --> 01:16:48,980
我们应该有点进展

1555
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:50,289
I thought you knew what you were doing.

1556
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:50,289
我以为你知道该怎么做

1557
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:52,551
I thought Dumbledore would have told you something worthwhile.

1558
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:52,551
邓不利多应该告诉过你一些有价值的信息

1559
01:16:52,552 --> 01:16:53,303
I thought you had a plan.

1560
01:16:52,552 --> 01:16:53,303
我以为你有计划

1561
01:16:53,304 --> 01:16:55,920
I told you everything Dumbledore told me.

1562
01:16:53,304 --> 01:16:55,920
邓不利多和我说的我都告诉你了

1563
01:16:55,921 --> 01:16:58,551
And in case you haven't notice we have found a Horcrux already.

1564
01:16:55,921 --> 01:16:58,551
而且我们已经找到了一块魂器

1565
01:16:58,552 --> 01:17:00,201
and we're as close to getting rid of it

1566
01:16:58,552 --> 01:17:00,201
找到了一个

1567
01:17:00,329 --> 01:17:01,934
as we are to finding the rest of them, aren't we?

1568
01:17:00,329 --> 01:17:01,934
就万事大吉了吗

1569
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:07,310
Ron, Please, take off the Horcrux.

1570
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:07,310
罗恩  把魂器取下来

1571
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:08,209
You wouldn't be saying any of this

1572
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:08,209
如果你没整天戴着这个

1573
01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:09,800
if you hadn't been wearing it all day.

1574
01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:09,800
就不会这么说

1575
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:12,300
You don't know, why I listen to the radio every night, do you?

1576
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:12,300
知道我为什么每晚都要听广播吗

1577
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:15,500
To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name,

1578
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:15,500
我想确认名单上没有金妮

1579
01:17:15,501 --> 01:17:17,570
or Fred, or George or Moms.

1580
01:17:15,501 --> 01:17:17,570
弗雷德  乔治  还有我妈

1581
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:19,290
You think I'm not listening too?

1582
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:19,290
你以为我没听吗

1583
01:17:19,410 --> 01:17:21,031
You think I don't know how it feels?

1584
01:17:19,410 --> 01:17:21,031
你以为我不知道这什么感觉吗

1585
01:17:21,032 --> 01:17:22,440
No you don't know how it feels!

1586
01:17:21,032 --> 01:17:22,440
你就是不知道

1587
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:25,610
Your parents are dead! You have no family!

1588
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:25,610
你父母死了  你没有家人

1589
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,287
Stop! Stop!

1590
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,287
别打了  停下

1591
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:30,630
- Let me go! - Go then!

1592
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:30,630
-让我走  -你走啊

1593
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:39,110
Ron!

1594
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:39,110
罗恩

1595
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:44,160
And you?

1596
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:44,160
你呢

1597
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:48,400
Are you coming or are you staying?

1598
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:48,400
跟我走还是留下

1599
01:17:55,970 --> 01:18:01,410
Fine, I get it. I saw you two the other night.

1600
01:17:55,970 --> 01:18:01,410
我明白了  我那晚看见你们了

1601
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:04,580
Ron there's... there's nothing.

1602
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:04,580
罗恩  我和他之间没什么

1603
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:07,680
Ron!

1604
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:07,680
罗恩

1605
01:18:11,370 --> 01:18:12,880
Ron, where are you going?

1606
01:18:11,370 --> 01:18:12,880
罗恩  你去哪

1607
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:16,440
Come back!

1608
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:16,440
回来

1609
01:18:18,268 --> 01:18:19,408
Ron!

1610
01:18:18,268 --> 01:18:19,408
罗恩

1611
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:25,562
Ron!

1612
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:25,562
罗恩

1613
01:19:39,670 --> 01:19:41,500
Salvia Hexia.

1614
01:19:39,670 --> 01:19:41,500
平安镇守

1615
01:22:49,370 --> 01:22:50,870
I open at the close.

1616
01:22:49,370 --> 01:22:50,870
我在结局开启

1617
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,700
Hermione. Hermione.

1618
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,700
赫敏  赫敏

1619
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:58,820
You were right. Snitches have flesh memories.

1620
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:58,820
你说的对  金色飞贼有肉体记忆

1621
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:00,905
But I didn't catch the first snitch with my hand.

1622
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:00,905
我第一次不是用手抓住的它

1623
01:23:00,906 --> 01:23:02,740
I almost swallowed it.

1624
01:23:00,906 --> 01:23:02,740
我差点把它吞了下去

1625
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:11,710
- "I open at the close. " - Yeah, what do you think that means?

1626
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:11,710
-我在结局开启  -是的  这什么意思

1627
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:13,000
I don't know.

1628
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:13,000
不知道

1629
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,190
I found something as well.

1630
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,190
我也有新发现

1631
01:23:24,330 --> 01:23:27,400
At first I thought it was an eye, but now I don't think it is.

1632
01:23:24,330 --> 01:23:27,400
我一直以为这是个眼睛的图片  但现在发现不是

1633
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:32,030
It isn't a rune, and it isn't anywhere in Spellman's syllabary.

1634
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:32,030
它不是魔文  也不在发音表里

1635
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,120
Somebody inked it in.

1636
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,120
是用墨水画的

1637
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,120
《诗翁彼豆故事集》

1638
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:36,020
It isn't part of the book, somebody drew it.

1639
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:36,020
这不是书里的内容  是有人画的

1640
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:38,950
Luna's dad was wearing it at Bill and Fleur's wedding.

1641
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:38,950
比尔和芙蓉婚礼上  卢娜爸爸身上也戴了这标志

1642
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:44,690
Why would someone draw it in a children's book?

1643
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:44,690
谁会在儿童书上画这个

1644
01:23:48,130 --> 01:23:49,990
Hermione, I've been thinking.

1645
01:23:48,130 --> 01:23:49,990
赫敏  我一直在想

1646
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:53,130
I want to go to Godric's Hollow.

1647
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:53,130
我想去高锥克山谷

1648
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:56,430
It's where I was born, It's where my parents died.

1649
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:56,430
我在那出生  我父母也是在那死的

1650
01:23:56,710 --> 01:23:57,835
That's exactly where he'll expect you to go

1651
01:23:56,710 --> 01:23:57,835
那地方对你如此特别

1652
01:23:57,836 --> 01:24:00,130
because it means something to you.

1653
01:23:57,836 --> 01:24:00,130
他肯定料到你会去那

1654
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:03,040
But it means something to him too, Hermione.

1655
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:03,040
对他也一样重要  赫敏

1656
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:05,180
You-Know-Who almost died there.

1657
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:05,180
神秘人差点死在那儿

1658
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:07,131
Isn't that exactly the type of place

1659
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:07,131
把魂器藏在那

1660
01:24:07,132 --> 01:24:09,020
he'd be likely to hide a Horcrux?

1661
01:24:07,132 --> 01:24:09,020
不正合他意吗

1662
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,720
I... it's dangerous, Harry.

1663
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,720
我...太危险了  哈利

1664
01:24:15,090 --> 01:24:16,333
But even I have to admit

1665
01:24:15,090 --> 01:24:16,333
但不得不承认

1666
01:24:16,334 --> 01:24:18,820
recently I've been thinking we have to go there.

1667
01:24:16,334 --> 01:24:18,820
我最近也一直在想  得去那一趟

1668
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:21,700
I think it's possible something else is hidden there.

1669
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:21,700
还有样东西可能也藏在那儿

1670
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:22,840
What?

1671
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:22,840
什么

1672
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:25,250
The Sword.

1673
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:25,250
剑

1674
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:28,320
If Dumbledore wanted you to find it,

1675
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:28,320
如果邓不利多想让你找到

1676
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,300
and didn't want it to falling in to the Ministry hands,

1677
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,300
同时不希望落入魔法部之手

1678
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:31,672
where better to hide it than

1679
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:31,672
还有什么地方

1680
01:24:31,673 --> 01:24:33,780
the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor.

1681
01:24:31,673 --> 01:24:33,780
会比格兰芬多的出生地更好呢

1682
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,170
Hermione.

1683
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,170
赫敏

1684
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:45,000
Don't ever let me give you a haircut again.

1685
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:45,000
以后别让我给你剪头发了

1686
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,190
I still think that we should use the Polyjuice Potion.

1687
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,190
咱们还是该喝复方汤剂的

1688
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:13,540
No, this is where I was born.

1689
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:13,540
不  这是我出生的地方

1690
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:16,210
I'm not returning as someone else.

1691
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:16,210
我不想扮成别人重返故乡

1692
01:25:32,870 --> 01:25:34,850
Harry, I think it's Christmas eve.

1693
01:25:32,870 --> 01:25:34,850
哈利  今天好像是平安夜

1694
01:25:36,950 --> 01:25:38,190
Listen.

1695
01:25:36,950 --> 01:25:38,190
听

1696
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:46,500
Do you think they may be in there, Hermione?

1697
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:46,500
你觉得他们在里面吗  赫敏

1698
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,640
My Mom and Dad.

1699
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,640
我的爸爸妈妈

1700
01:25:55,210 --> 01:25:57,200
Yeah, I think they would.

1701
01:25:55,210 --> 01:25:57,200
在吧

1702
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:36,950
Ignotus Peverell.

1703
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:36,950
伊格诺图斯·佩弗利尔

1704
01:26:38,770 --> 01:26:40,490
Hey, Harry?

1705
01:26:38,770 --> 01:26:40,490
哈利

1706
01:26:47,483 --> 01:26:49,420
詹姆士·波特与莉莉·波特

1707
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:19,420
Merry Christmas, Hermione.

1708
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:19,420
圣诞快乐  赫敏

1709
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:23,800
Merry Christmas, Harry.

1710
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:23,800
圣诞快乐  哈利

1711
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:46,545
Harry, there is someone watching us.

1712
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:46,545
哈利  有人正盯着我们

1713
01:27:47,166 --> 01:27:48,649
By the church.

1714
01:27:47,166 --> 01:27:48,649
教堂那边

1715
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,610
I think I know who that is.

1716
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,610
我大概知道是谁

1717
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:08,040
- I don't like this, Harry. - Hermione, she knew Dumbledore.

1718
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:08,040
-我觉得不妥  哈利  -赫敏  她认识邓不利多

1719
01:28:08,090 --> 01:28:09,810
She might have the sword.

1720
01:28:08,090 --> 01:28:09,810
剑可能在她那里

1721
01:28:29,730 --> 01:28:31,600
This is where they died, Hermione.

1722
01:28:29,730 --> 01:28:31,600
他们在这死的  赫敏

1723
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:40,560
This is where he murdered them.

1724
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:40,560
这是他杀死他们的地方

1725
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:55,450
You're Bathilda, aren't you?

1726
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:55,450
你是巴希达吗

1727
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:03,060
Here, let me do that.

1728
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:03,060
让我来吧

1729
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:30,830
Miss Bagshot, who is this man?

1730
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:30,830
巴沙特太太  这个男人是谁

1731
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,150
Harry.

1732
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,150
哈利

1733
01:30:11,515 --> 01:30:12,859
阿不思·邓不利多传
丽塔·斯基特着

1734
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:32,174
Harry!

1735
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:32,174
哈利

1736
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:08,120
Are you feeling better?

1737
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:08,120
感觉好点了吗

1738
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:14,290
You've outdone yourself this time, Hermione.

1739
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:14,290
这次移形成功了  赫敏

1740
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:16,090
Forest of Dean.

1741
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:16,090
这是迪恩森林

1742
01:33:17,780 --> 01:33:21,480
I came here once with Mum and Dad. Years ago.

1743
01:33:17,780 --> 01:33:21,480
几年前我和爸妈来过这

1744
01:33:22,770 --> 01:33:24,250
It's just how I remember it.

1745
01:33:22,770 --> 01:33:24,250
跟我记忆里的一模一样

1746
01:33:25,110 --> 01:33:28,540
The trees, the river, everything.

1747
01:33:25,110 --> 01:33:28,540
树林  小河  一切

1748
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:31,460
Like nothings changed.

1749
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:31,460
都如同没变一般

1750
01:33:33,610 --> 01:33:35,870
Not true of course, everything's changed.

1751
01:33:33,610 --> 01:33:35,870
但其实不是  一切都变了

1752
01:33:37,181 --> 01:33:38,985
If I brought my parents back here now,

1753
01:33:37,181 --> 01:33:38,985
就算我现在带父母回来

1754
01:33:38,986 --> 01:33:40,630
they probably wouldn't recognize any of it.

1755
01:33:38,986 --> 01:33:40,630
他们也未必能认出来了

1756
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:44,820
Not the trees.

1757
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:44,820
树林不在

1758
01:33:45,690 --> 01:33:46,870
Not the river.

1759
01:33:45,690 --> 01:33:46,870
小河不在

1760
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:50,670
Not even me.

1761
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:50,670
我也不再是那个我

1762
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:58,740
Maybe we should just stay here, Harry.

1763
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:58,740
也许我们就该待在这  哈利

1764
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:02,880
Grow old.

1765
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:02,880
慢慢老去

1766
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:12,140
You wanted to know who was the boy in the photograph was.

1767
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:12,140
你想知道照片里的男孩是谁吗

1768
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:14,840
I know.

1769
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:14,840
我知道

1770
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:18,240
Gellert Grindelwald.

1771
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:18,240
吉莱特·格林德沃

1772
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:28,050
He's the thief I saw in Gregorovitch's wand shop.

1773
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:28,050
我看到他在格里戈维奇的魔杖商店偷东西

1774
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:31,730
Speaking of which, where is my wand?

1775
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:31,730
对了  我的魔杖哪去了

1776
01:34:33,330 --> 01:34:35,180
Where's my wand, Hermione?

1777
01:34:33,330 --> 01:34:35,180
我的魔杖呢  赫敏

1778
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:46,022
As we were leaving Godrics Hollow

1779
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:46,022
离开高锥克山谷的时候

1780
01:34:46,023 --> 01:34:48,350
I cast a curse and it rebounded.

1781
01:34:46,023 --> 01:34:48,350
我施咒不小心击中了它

1782
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,100
I'm sorry.

1783
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,100
对不起

1784
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,080
I tried to mend it, but wands are different.

1785
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,080
我尽力了  但魔杖没那么容易修好

1786
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:56,330
It's done.

1787
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:56,330
算了

1788
01:34:58,020 --> 01:34:59,580
Leave me yours.

1789
01:34:58,020 --> 01:34:59,580
先用你的吧

1790
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:01,750
Go inside and get warm.

1791
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:01,750
你进去取暖

1792
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:04,200
I'll take the locket as well.

1793
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:04,200
挂坠也给我来戴

1794
01:36:44,530 --> 01:36:45,640
Lumos.

1795
01:36:44,530 --> 01:36:45,640
荧光闪烁

1796
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:28,680
Accio sword!

1797
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:28,680
宝剑飞来

1798
01:37:34,290 --> 01:37:35,590
Diffindo.

1799
01:37:34,290 --> 01:37:35,590
四分五裂

1800
01:39:16,590 --> 01:39:17,690
Hermione?

1801
01:39:16,590 --> 01:39:17,690
赫敏

1802
01:39:17,990 --> 01:39:19,260
Are you mental?

1803
01:39:17,990 --> 01:39:19,260
你疯了吗

1804
01:39:21,050 --> 01:39:22,250
It was you.

1805
01:39:21,050 --> 01:39:22,250
是你

1806
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:25,910
Well yeah, bit obvious, I think.

1807
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:25,910
是啊  很明显吧

1808
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:28,250
And you cast the doe as well did you?

1809
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:28,250
是你召唤出那雌鹿的吗

1810
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:30,390
No, I thought that was you.

1811
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:30,390
不是  我以为是你呢

1812
01:39:30,390 --> 01:39:32,350
No, my Patronus was a stag.

1813
01:39:30,390 --> 01:39:32,350
不  我的守护神是一只雄鹿

1814
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:35,870
Right, now that was...

1815
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:35,870
对  刚那头有...

1816
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:41,210
Okay, Ron. Do it.

1817
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:41,210
行了  罗恩  开始吧

1818
01:39:42,510 --> 01:39:44,346
I can't handle it.

1819
01:39:42,510 --> 01:39:44,346
我不能碰它

1820
01:39:44,347 --> 01:39:47,610
That thing affect me more than it effects you and Hermione.

1821
01:39:44,347 --> 01:39:47,610
我比你和赫敏更容易受它影响

1822
01:39:47,610 --> 01:39:49,670
- All the more reason. - No, I can't.

1823
01:39:47,610 --> 01:39:49,670
-别说废话了  -不  我不能

1824
01:39:49,670 --> 01:39:51,170
Then why are you here?

1825
01:39:49,670 --> 01:39:51,170
那你来干嘛

1826
01:39:52,070 --> 01:39:53,670
Why did you come back?

1827
01:39:52,070 --> 01:39:53,670
你回来干嘛

1828
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:05,080
Now I'll have to speak to it in order for it to open.

1829
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:05,080
现在我用蛇佬腔让它打开

1830
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:06,250
When it does, don't hesitate.

1831
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:06,250
一旦打开  别迟疑

1832
01:40:06,670 --> 01:40:08,860
I don't know what's in there, but it will put up a fight.

1833
01:40:06,670 --> 01:40:08,860
我不知道里面是什么  但肯定有一场恶战

1834
01:40:08,860 --> 01:40:11,320
The bit of Riddle that was in that diary tried to kill me.

1835
01:40:08,860 --> 01:40:11,320
日记中的神秘人想杀了我

1836
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:17,950
One.

1837
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:17,950
一

1838
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:20,150
Two.

1839
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:20,150
二

1840
01:40:20,940 --> 01:40:22,060
Three.

1841
01:40:20,940 --> 01:40:22,060
三

1842
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:37,500
I have seen your heart and it is mine.

1843
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:37,500
我曾见过你的心  它是属于我的

1844
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:44,120
I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley.

1845
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:44,120
我曾见过你的梦  罗恩·韦斯莱

1846
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:46,860
And I see your fears.

1847
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:46,860
我也曾见过你的恐惧

1848
01:40:48,860 --> 01:40:52,550
Least loved by your mother, who craved a daughter.

1849
01:40:48,860 --> 01:40:52,550
母亲的爱予你最少  她更希望是个女孩

1850
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:57,940
Least loved by the girl, who prefers your friend.

1851
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:57,940
心上人之爱予你最少  她更爱你的朋友

1852
01:40:59,370 --> 01:41:01,040
Ron, kill it!

1853
01:40:59,370 --> 01:41:01,040
罗恩  快刺

1854
01:41:07,950 --> 01:41:09,880
We were better without you.

1855
01:41:07,950 --> 01:41:09,880
没有你我们会更好

1856
01:41:11,250 --> 01:41:13,280
Happy without you.

1857
01:41:11,250 --> 01:41:13,280
更开心

1858
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:17,880
Who would look at you? Who has, Harry Potter.

1859
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:17,880
有了哈利·波特  谁会看你一眼

1860
01:41:21,710 --> 01:41:23,140
What are you, compared to the chosen one?

1861
01:41:21,710 --> 01:41:23,140
和被选中的人相比  你算什么

1862
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:24,460
Ron, it's lying!

1863
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:24,460
罗恩  它在说谎

1864
01:41:24,690 --> 01:41:27,650
Your mother confessed, she would prefer me as a son.

1865
01:41:24,690 --> 01:41:27,650
你妈跟我说过  更希望我做她的儿子

1866
01:41:27,690 --> 01:41:29,720
What woman would take you?

1867
01:41:27,690 --> 01:41:29,720
哪个女人会喜欢你

1868
01:41:30,870 --> 01:41:35,230
You are nothing... nothing.

1869
01:41:30,870 --> 01:41:35,230
你和他相比一无是处

1870
01:41:36,490 --> 01:41:39,600
Nothing compared to him.

1871
01:41:36,490 --> 01:41:39,600
一无是处

1872
01:42:30,740 --> 01:42:34,730
Just think.

1873
01:42:30,740 --> 01:42:34,730
想想

1874
01:42:34,731 --> 01:42:35,731
There are only three to go.

1875
01:42:34,731 --> 01:42:35,731
只剩下三个了

1876
01:42:38,230 --> 01:42:39,350
Hermione?

1877
01:42:38,230 --> 01:42:39,350
赫敏

1878
01:42:42,270 --> 01:42:43,190
Hermione?

1879
01:42:42,270 --> 01:42:43,190
赫敏

1880
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:50,060
Is everything alright?

1881
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:50,060
还好吗

1882
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:55,140
It's fine. Actually, yeah, it's more than fine.

1883
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:55,140
很好  应该是好极了

1884
01:43:00,502 --> 01:43:00,967
Hey.

1885
01:43:00,502 --> 01:43:00,967
嘿

1886
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:07,600
You...

1887
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:07,600
你

1888
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:11,670
...A complete ass, Ronald Weasley!

1889
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:11,670
罗恩·韦斯莱  十足的大混蛋

1890
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:16,100
You show up here after weeks and you say 'hey'?

1891
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:16,100
走了几个星期  回来就说声  嘿

1892
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:19,630
Where's my wand, Harry?

1893
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:19,630
我的魔杖呢  哈利

1894
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:21,290
- Where's my wand? - I don't know.

1895
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:21,290
-我的魔杖呢  -我不知道

1896
01:43:21,630 --> 01:43:23,330
Harry Potter. You give me my wand!

1897
01:43:21,630 --> 01:43:23,330
哈利·波特  把魔杖给我

1898
01:43:23,770 --> 01:43:26,710
- How come he's got your wand? - Never mind why's he got my wand.

1899
01:43:23,770 --> 01:43:26,710
-他怎么拿你的魔杖  -关你什么事

1900
01:43:29,950 --> 01:43:31,150
What is that?

1901
01:43:29,950 --> 01:43:31,150
这是什么

1902
01:43:34,190 --> 01:43:35,470
You destroyed it.

1903
01:43:34,190 --> 01:43:35,470
你摧毁了魂器

1904
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:39,566
And how is it that you just

1905
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:39,566
你怎么会拿到

1906
01:43:39,567 --> 01:43:41,740
happen to have the sword of Gryffindor?

1907
01:43:39,567 --> 01:43:41,740
格兰芬多剑的呢

1908
01:43:42,620 --> 01:43:43,930
It's a long story.

1909
01:43:42,620 --> 01:43:43,930
说来话长

1910
01:43:47,890 --> 01:43:49,820
Don't think this changes anything.

1911
01:43:47,890 --> 01:43:49,820
别以为这样我就会饶了你

1912
01:43:50,340 --> 01:43:53,280
Of course not. I only just destroyed a bloody Horcrux,

1913
01:43:50,340 --> 01:43:53,280
当然不会  我只是摧毁了一个魂器

1914
01:43:53,290 --> 01:43:55,120
why will that change anything.

1915
01:43:53,290 --> 01:43:55,120
你当然不会原谅我

1916
01:43:55,670 --> 01:43:59,040
Look, I wanted to come back as soon as I left.

1917
01:43:55,670 --> 01:43:59,040
我刚走就后悔了

1918
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,270
I just didn't know how to find you.

1919
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,270
只是不知道上哪找你们

1920
01:44:01,270 --> 01:44:02,810
Yeah, how did you find us?

1921
01:44:01,270 --> 01:44:02,810
那你怎么找到的

1922
01:44:03,670 --> 01:44:06,460
With this. Doesn't just turn off lights.

1923
01:44:03,670 --> 01:44:06,460
这个  不只能熄灯

1924
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:08,430
I don't know how it works,

1925
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:08,430
我不知道它是怎么做到的

1926
01:44:08,430 --> 01:44:11,640
but Christmas morning I sleeping in this little pub.

1927
01:44:08,430 --> 01:44:11,640
但圣诞节早上  我睡在一个小酒馆

1928
01:44:11,790 --> 01:44:13,530
Keeping away from some snatchers.

1929
01:44:11,790 --> 01:44:13,530
躲避那些掠夺贼

1930
01:44:14,450 --> 01:44:17,050
- When I heard it. - It?

1931
01:44:14,450 --> 01:44:17,050
-我听到它  -它

1932
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:20,500
A voice.

1933
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:20,500
一个声音

1934
01:44:22,730 --> 01:44:24,140
Your voice, Hermione.

1935
01:44:22,730 --> 01:44:24,140
你的声音  赫敏

1936
01:44:25,010 --> 01:44:26,370
Comin' out of it.

1937
01:44:25,010 --> 01:44:26,370
从这里面发出来

1938
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:29,020
And what exactly did I say if I may ask?

1939
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:29,020
那我都说了些什么

1940
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:30,170
My name.

1941
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:30,170
我的名字

1942
01:44:31,150 --> 01:44:32,440
Just my name.

1943
01:44:31,150 --> 01:44:32,440
只有我的名字

1944
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:35,610
Like a whisper.

1945
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:35,610
像是轻声低语

1946
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:40,780
So I took it, clicked it...

1947
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:40,780
所以我拿出来  打开

1948
01:44:41,550 --> 01:44:43,510
and this tiny ball of light appeared.

1949
01:44:41,550 --> 01:44:43,510
出现了一个小小的蓝色光球

1950
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:47,860
And I knew, sure enough.

1951
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:47,860
我就知道了  非常肯定

1952
01:44:48,630 --> 01:44:50,930
It floated towards me, the ball of light.

1953
01:44:48,630 --> 01:44:50,930
那个小光球向我飘来

1954
01:44:53,050 --> 01:44:57,470
Went right to my chest, straight through me. Right here.

1955
01:44:53,050 --> 01:44:57,470
落入了我的胸膛  就从这里

1956
01:44:58,560 --> 01:44:59,781
I knew it was gonna take me where I needed to go,

1957
01:44:58,560 --> 01:44:59,781
我知道它会把我带到想去的地方

1958
01:44:59,782 --> 01:45:01,970
so I disapparated.

1959
01:44:59,782 --> 01:45:01,970
我用了幻影移形

1960
01:45:02,410 --> 01:45:04,040
I came to this hillside.

1961
01:45:02,410 --> 01:45:04,040
就到了山的这边

1962
01:45:05,030 --> 01:45:07,760
It was dark, I had no idea where I was.

1963
01:45:05,030 --> 01:45:07,760
当时很黑  我不知道身处何地

1964
01:45:08,230 --> 01:45:10,630
I just hoped that one of you would show yourself.

1965
01:45:08,230 --> 01:45:10,630
我只希望你们当中有谁能出现

1966
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:13,440
You did.

1967
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:13,440
你出现了

1968
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:33,330
I've always liked these flames Hermione makes.

1969
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:33,330
我一直很喜欢赫敏造的小火苗

1970
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:39,940
How long do you reckon she'll stay mad at me?

1971
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:39,940
你觉得她还要生我的气多久

1972
01:45:41,921 --> 01:45:45,340
Just keep talking about that little ball of light touching your heart.

1973
01:45:41,921 --> 01:45:45,340
多说几遍那个小光球融入你心的故事

1974
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:49,230
- And she'll come around. - It's true. Every word.

1975
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:49,230
-她的气就消了  -千真万确

1976
01:45:51,570 --> 01:45:53,300
This is gonna sound crazy.

1977
01:45:51,570 --> 01:45:53,300
可能听起来不可思议

1978
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:56,762
But I think, thats why Dumbledore left it to me.

1979
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:56,762
但我想这就是邓不利多把它给我的原因

1980
01:45:57,021 --> 01:45:57,869
The Deluminator.

1981
01:45:57,021 --> 01:45:57,869
这个熄灯器

1982
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,930
I think he knew that somehow I'd need to find my way back.

1983
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,930
他知道我可能需要找到回来的路

1984
01:46:01,930 --> 01:46:03,600
That she'd lead me.

1985
01:46:01,930 --> 01:46:03,600
她将为我指明道路

1986
01:46:07,310 --> 01:46:10,159
You know, I just realized. You need a wand, don't you?

1987
01:46:07,310 --> 01:46:10,159
我刚想到  你需要根魔杖是吗

1988
01:46:10,164 --> 01:46:12,030
- Yeah. - I got one here.

1989
01:46:10,164 --> 01:46:12,030
-是啊  -我这有一根

1990
01:46:12,990 --> 01:46:16,890
It's a Blackthorn, 10 inches, nothing special.

1991
01:46:12,990 --> 01:46:16,890
黑刺李木的  十英寸  没什么特别之处

1992
01:46:16,890 --> 01:46:18,710
I reckon it'll do.

1993
01:46:16,890 --> 01:46:18,710
应该还能用

1994
01:46:19,730 --> 01:46:21,790
Took it off a snatcher a couple of weeks ago.

1995
01:46:19,730 --> 01:46:21,790
几星期前从一个掠夺贼那抢的

1996
01:46:22,820 --> 01:46:24,322
Don't tell Hermione this.

1997
01:46:22,820 --> 01:46:24,322
别让赫敏知道

1998
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:26,097
They're a bit dim, snatchers.

1999
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:26,097
掠夺贼有点傻

2000
01:46:26,890 --> 01:46:31,330
This one is definitely partial to smelling.

2001
01:46:26,890 --> 01:46:31,330
但嗅觉非常灵敏

2002
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:32,570
- Engorgio. - Put it out.

2003
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:32,570
-速速变大  -快弄灭

2004
01:46:32,580 --> 01:46:34,330
What's going on in there?

2005
01:46:32,580 --> 01:46:34,330
里面出什么事了

2006
01:46:34,330 --> 01:46:35,030
- Nothing! - Nothing!

2007
01:46:34,330 --> 01:46:35,030
-没事  -没事

2008
01:46:37,470 --> 01:46:38,740
We need to talk.

2009
01:46:37,470 --> 01:46:38,740
我们得谈谈

2010
01:46:40,230 --> 01:46:41,590
Yeah, alright.

2011
01:46:40,230 --> 01:46:41,590
好啊

2012
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:50,210
I want to go see Xenophilius Lovegood.

2013
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:50,210
我想去找谢诺菲留斯·洛夫古德

2014
01:46:50,650 --> 01:46:51,660
Sorry?

2015
01:46:50,650 --> 01:46:51,660
什么

2016
01:46:53,300 --> 01:46:57,480
See this? It's a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald.

2017
01:46:53,300 --> 01:46:57,480
看这个  这是邓不利多写给格林德瓦的信

2018
01:46:57,650 --> 01:46:58,715
Look at the signature.

2019
01:46:57,650 --> 01:46:58,715
看这个签名

2020
01:47:00,396 --> 01:47:01,507
It's the mark again.

2021
01:47:00,396 --> 01:47:01,507
又是这个符号

2022
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:05,010
It keeps cropping up.

2023
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:05,010
它时时闪现

2024
01:47:05,980 --> 01:47:09,240
In Beedle the Bard, in the graveyard in Godric's Hollow.

2025
01:47:05,980 --> 01:47:09,240
在诗翁彼豆故事集里  在高锥克山谷的墓地

2026
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:12,290
It was there too.

2027
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:12,290
在那也有

2028
01:47:13,070 --> 01:47:15,750
- Where? - Outside Gregorvitch's wand shop.

2029
01:47:13,070 --> 01:47:15,750
-哪  -格里戈维奇的魔杖店外

2030
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:19,190
- What does it mean? - Look.

2031
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:19,190
-它代表什么意思  -听着

2032
01:47:19,670 --> 01:47:22,430
You've got no idea where the next Horcrux is, and neither do I.

2033
01:47:19,670 --> 01:47:22,430
你我都不知道下个魂器在哪

2034
01:47:24,690 --> 01:47:27,150
But this, this means something.

2035
01:47:24,690 --> 01:47:27,150
但这个  这个一定代表着什么

2036
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:29,084
I'm sure of it.

2037
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:29,084
我十分确定

2038
01:47:29,085 --> 01:47:31,120
Yeah. Hermione's right.

2039
01:47:29,085 --> 01:47:31,120
是啊  赫敏说的对极了

2040
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:34,020
We ought to see Lovegood.

2041
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:34,020
我们应该去见见洛夫古德

2042
01:47:35,430 --> 01:47:36,079
Let's vote on it.

2043
01:47:35,430 --> 01:47:36,079
还是投票表决吧

2044
01:47:37,079 --> 01:47:38,015
Those in favor.

2045
01:47:37,079 --> 01:47:38,015
同意的举手

2046
01:48:02,780 --> 01:48:04,560
You're not still mad at him, are you?

2047
01:48:02,780 --> 01:48:04,560
你不会还在生他的气吧

2048
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:07,320
I'm always mad at him.

2049
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:07,320
他什么时候让我省过心

2050
01:48:10,450 --> 01:48:13,500
Luna, we're here.

2051
01:48:10,450 --> 01:48:13,500
卢娜  我们来了

2052
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:16,540
Keep off the Dirigible Plums.

2053
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:16,540
别碰飞艇李

2054
01:48:17,540 --> 01:48:20,540
唱唱反调主编  谢·洛夫古德

2055
01:48:21,745 --> 01:48:23,540
Keep off the Dirigible Plums.

2056
01:48:21,745 --> 01:48:23,540
别碰飞艇李

2057
01:48:33,670 --> 01:48:36,140
What is it? Who are you?

2058
01:48:33,670 --> 01:48:36,140
怎么了  你们是谁

2059
01:48:36,650 --> 01:48:37,570
What do you want?

2060
01:48:36,650 --> 01:48:37,570
想要干什么

2061
01:48:37,830 --> 01:48:39,450
Hello, Mr. Lovegood.

2062
01:48:37,830 --> 01:48:39,450
您好  洛夫古德先生

2063
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:42,340
I'm Harry Potter, we met a few months ago.

2064
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:42,340
我是哈利·波特  我们几个月前见过

2065
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:47,730
Can we come in?

2066
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:47,730
我们能进来吗

2067
01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:54,070
- Where is Luna? - Luna?

2068
01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:54,070
-卢娜去哪了  -卢娜吗

2069
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,270
She'll be along.

2070
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,270
她一会儿就来

2071
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:13,600
So, how can I help you, Mr. Potter?

2072
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:13,600
我能帮您先什么呢  波特先生

2073
01:49:14,470 --> 01:49:16,630
Well, actually,

2074
01:49:14,470 --> 01:49:16,630
实际上

2075
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:20,890
it was about something you were wearing around your neck at the wedding.

2076
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:20,890
是关于你在婚礼上戴在脖子上的

2077
01:49:20,890 --> 01:49:22,170
It was a symbol.

2078
01:49:20,890 --> 01:49:22,170
那个标志

2079
01:49:24,650 --> 01:49:27,530
- You mean this? - Yes.

2080
01:49:24,650 --> 01:49:27,530
-你是说这个吗  -是的

2081
01:49:28,730 --> 01:49:30,330
That's it exactly.

2082
01:49:28,730 --> 01:49:30,330
正是这个

2083
01:49:31,220 --> 01:49:35,270
What we wondered is... what is it?

2084
01:49:31,220 --> 01:49:35,270
我们想知道  这是什么

2085
01:49:35,630 --> 01:49:36,700
What is it?

2086
01:49:35,630 --> 01:49:36,700
这是什么吗

2087
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:40,390
Well, it's the sign of the Deathly Hallows, of course.

2088
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:40,390
这还用说  死亡圣器的标志啊

2089
01:49:40,430 --> 01:49:41,910
- The What? - The What?

2090
01:49:40,430 --> 01:49:41,910
-什么  -什么

2091
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:43,050
The Deathly Hallows.

2092
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:43,050
死亡圣器

2093
01:49:43,050 --> 01:49:47,240
I assume you are all familiar with the tale of the three brothers.

2094
01:49:43,050 --> 01:49:47,240
我想你们都熟悉三兄弟的传说吧

2095
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:48,085
- Yes... - Yes.

2096
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:48,085
-是的  -是的

2097
01:49:48,086 --> 01:49:48,930
No.

2098
01:49:48,086 --> 01:49:48,930
不

2099
01:49:54,190 --> 01:49:55,660
I have it in here.

2100
01:49:54,190 --> 01:49:55,660
我这里面有

2101
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:08,130
There were once three brothers,

2102
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:08,130
从前有三兄弟

2103
01:50:08,130 --> 01:50:12,070
who were traveling along a lonely winding road...

2104
01:50:08,130 --> 01:50:12,070
在一条僻静的羊肠小道上赶路

2105
01:50:12,470 --> 01:50:14,590
- At twilight. - Midnight.

2106
01:50:12,470 --> 01:50:14,590
-天色已近黄昏  -是午夜

2107
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:16,960
Mom always said midnight.

2108
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:16,960
妈妈一直说是午夜

2109
01:50:21,590 --> 01:50:23,310
Twilight's fine, better actually.

2110
01:50:21,590 --> 01:50:23,310
黄昏也不错  实际上更好

2111
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:30,520
- Do you want to read it? - Uh, no.

2112
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:30,520
-你想来念吗  -你念就好了

2113
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:37,054
There were once three brothers, who were traveling along...

2114
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:37,054
从前有三兄弟

2115
01:50:37,325 --> 01:50:38,614
a lonely winding road...

2116
01:50:37,325 --> 01:50:38,614
在一条僻静的羊肠小道上赶路

2117
01:50:39,054 --> 01:50:39,846
At twilight.

2118
01:50:39,054 --> 01:50:39,846
天色已近黄昏

2119
01:50:42,650 --> 01:50:45,147
In time the brothers reached

2120
01:50:42,650 --> 01:50:45,147
不久  三兄弟来到一条河边

2121
01:50:45,148 --> 01:50:47,260
a river too treacherous to pass.

2122
01:50:45,148 --> 01:50:47,260
河水太险  无法渡过

2123
01:50:48,490 --> 01:50:52,650
But they were learned in the magical arts,

2124
01:50:48,490 --> 01:50:52,650
但三兄弟精通魔法

2125
01:50:53,210 --> 01:50:54,780
the three brothers simply waved their wands, and made a bridge.

2126
01:50:53,210 --> 01:50:54,780
他们只挥了下魔杖  就变出了一座桥

2127
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,170
Before they could cross however,

2128
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,170
然而他们正准备过桥时

2129
01:50:59,170 --> 01:51:02,700
they found their path blocked by a hooded figure.

2130
01:50:59,170 --> 01:51:02,700
却发现一个戴兜帽的身影挡住了去路

2131
01:51:03,530 --> 01:51:05,000
It was Death.

2132
01:51:03,530 --> 01:51:05,000
那就是死神

2133
01:51:05,310 --> 01:51:06,850
And he felt cheated.

2134
01:51:05,310 --> 01:51:06,850
他觉得被欺骗了

2135
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:08,338
Cheated,

2136
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:08,338
因为

2137
01:51:08,339 --> 01:51:10,710
because travelers would always drown in the river.

2138
01:51:08,339 --> 01:51:10,710
旅行者通常会淹死于此

2139
01:51:10,780 --> 01:51:12,260
But Death was cunning.

2140
01:51:10,780 --> 01:51:12,260
但死神很狡猾

2141
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:16,880
He pretended to congratulate the three brothers on their magic.

2142
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:16,880
他假装称赞三兄弟的魔法

2143
01:51:17,090 --> 01:51:19,747
And said, that each had earned a prize for having

2144
01:51:17,090 --> 01:51:19,747
还说  他们凭着聪明才智躲过了死神

2145
01:51:19,748 --> 01:51:21,310
been clever enough to evade him.

2146
01:51:19,748 --> 01:51:21,310
每人可以获得一个奖励

2147
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:27,320
The oldest asked for a wand, more powerful than any in existence.

2148
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:27,320
老大想要一根天底下最强大的魔杖

2149
01:51:27,420 --> 01:51:28,727
So death fashioned him a

2150
01:51:27,420 --> 01:51:28,727
因此死神就用旁边的一棵接骨木树

2151
01:51:28,728 --> 01:51:31,070
wand from an elder tree that stood nearby.

2152
01:51:28,728 --> 01:51:31,070
给他做了根魔杖

2153
01:51:33,130 --> 01:51:37,610
The second brother decided he wanted to humiliate death even further,

2154
01:51:33,130 --> 01:51:37,610
老二决定继续羞辱死神

2155
01:51:37,930 --> 01:51:41,370
and asked for the power to recall loved ones from the grave.

2156
01:51:37,930 --> 01:51:41,370
他想拥有能让死去的爱人复活的能力

2157
01:51:42,770 --> 01:51:46,300
So Death plucked a stone from the river and offered it to him.

2158
01:51:42,770 --> 01:51:46,300
因此死神就从河里变了块石头给他

2159
01:51:47,710 --> 01:51:50,950
Finally, Death turned to the third brother.

2160
01:51:47,710 --> 01:51:50,950
最后  死神转向老三

2161
01:51:52,830 --> 01:51:54,590
A humble man,

2162
01:51:52,830 --> 01:51:54,590
老三很谦逊

2163
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:58,630
he asked for something that would allow him to go forth from that place,

2164
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:58,630
他要一件能让他离开那里

2165
01:51:58,730 --> 01:52:01,150
without being followed by death.

2166
01:51:58,730 --> 01:52:01,150
而不会被死神跟随的东西

2167
01:52:03,030 --> 01:52:08,290
And so it was that death reluctantly handed over his own cloak of invisibility.

2168
01:52:03,030 --> 01:52:08,290
死神极不情愿地  把自己的隐形斗篷给了他

2169
01:52:12,670 --> 01:52:15,150
The first brother traveled to a distant village.

2170
01:52:12,670 --> 01:52:15,150
老大来到了一个遥远的山村

2171
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:17,450
While with the elder wand in hand,

2172
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:17,450
用那根接骨木做成的老魔杖

2173
01:52:17,450 --> 01:52:20,800
he killed a wizard with whom he had once quarrels.

2174
01:52:17,450 --> 01:52:20,800
杀死了一个与他不合的巫师

2175
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:26,217
Drunk with the power that the

2176
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:26,217
老魔杖赋予他的魔力令他欣喜若狂

2177
01:52:26,218 --> 01:52:27,210
elder wand had given him.

2178
01:52:26,218 --> 01:52:27,210
喝得酩酊大醉

2179
01:52:27,590 --> 01:52:29,770
He bragged of his invincibility.

2180
01:52:27,590 --> 01:52:29,770
他四处炫耀自己的无敌威力

2181
01:52:33,380 --> 01:52:34,740
But that night...

2182
01:52:33,380 --> 01:52:34,740
但就在那晚

2183
01:52:35,460 --> 01:52:37,076
Another wizard stole the wand

2184
01:52:35,460 --> 01:52:37,076
另一个巫师偷走了魔杖

2185
01:52:37,077 --> 01:52:39,640
and slit the brother's throat for good measure.

2186
01:52:37,077 --> 01:52:39,640
并割断了他的喉咙

2187
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:42,990
And so death took the first brother for his own.

2188
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:42,990
就这样死神取走了老大的性命

2189
01:52:44,750 --> 01:52:46,460
The second brother journeyed to his home.

2190
01:52:44,750 --> 01:52:46,460
老二旅行回家

2191
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:49,370
Where he took the stone and turned it twice in hand.

2192
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:49,370
他拿出复活石并且在手里转了两次

2193
01:52:49,820 --> 01:52:50,982
To his delight

2194
01:52:49,820 --> 01:52:50,982
令他欣喜的是

2195
01:52:51,017 --> 01:52:54,126
the girl he'd once hoped to marry before her untimely death,

2196
01:52:51,017 --> 01:52:54,126
他曾想迎娶却不幸早逝的女孩

2197
01:52:54,730 --> 01:52:56,130
appeared before him.

2198
01:52:54,730 --> 01:52:56,130
出现在了他身前

2199
01:52:57,330 --> 01:53:00,119
Yet soon she turned sad and cold

2200
01:52:57,330 --> 01:53:00,119
但不久她就变得悲伤难耐  心灰意冷

2201
01:53:00,148 --> 01:53:02,310
for she did not belong in the mortal world.

2202
01:53:00,148 --> 01:53:02,310
因为她并不属于人间

2203
01:53:02,860 --> 01:53:04,748
Driven mad with hopeless longing,

2204
01:53:02,860 --> 01:53:04,748
渴求无望  老二陷入了疯癫

2205
01:53:04,749 --> 01:53:07,580
the second brother killed himself so as to join her.

2206
01:53:04,749 --> 01:53:07,580
为了能和她真正在一起  他自杀身亡

2207
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:11,810
And so death took the second brother.

2208
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:11,810
就这样  死神取走了老二的性命

2209
01:53:12,450 --> 01:53:15,230
As for the third brother, Death searched for many years

2210
01:53:12,450 --> 01:53:15,230
而说到老三  死神找了他好多年

2211
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:18,020
but was never able to find him.

2212
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:18,020
却始终没能找到他

2213
01:53:18,790 --> 01:53:20,670
Only when he had attained a great age did the youngest brother,

2214
01:53:18,790 --> 01:53:20,670
兄弟中最小的老三  一直活到了很大年纪

2215
01:53:20,670 --> 01:53:25,140
shed the cloak of invisibility and give it to his son.

2216
01:53:20,670 --> 01:53:25,140
才脱下隐形斗篷  交给了他儿子

2217
01:53:27,340 --> 01:53:29,620
He then greeted death as a old friend

2218
01:53:27,340 --> 01:53:29,620
然后他像老朋友见面一样迎接了死神

2219
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:34,660
and went with him gladly departing this life as equals.

2220
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:34,660
并以平等的身份与死神一起  安然离开了人间

2221
01:53:36,650 --> 01:53:40,640
So there you are. Those are the Deathly Hallows.

2222
01:53:36,650 --> 01:53:40,640
就是这样  这些就是死亡圣器

2223
01:53:42,750 --> 01:53:45,080
I'm sorry sir, I still don't quite understand.

2224
01:53:42,750 --> 01:53:45,080
抱歉  先生  我还是不太理解

2225
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:05,920
The Elder wand.

2226
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:05,920
老魔杖

2227
01:54:07,030 --> 01:54:09,640
The most powerful wand ever made.

2228
01:54:07,030 --> 01:54:09,640
世上最具威力的魔杖

2229
01:54:20,750 --> 01:54:22,830
The resurrection stone.

2230
01:54:20,750 --> 01:54:22,830
复活石

2231
01:54:33,410 --> 01:54:36,794
The cloak of invisibility.

2232
01:54:33,410 --> 01:54:36,794
隐形斗篷

2233
01:54:39,878 --> 01:54:42,174
Together, they make the Deathly Hallows.

2234
01:54:39,878 --> 01:54:42,174
合在一起  就组成了死亡圣器

2235
01:54:43,210 --> 01:54:48,290
Together, they make one master of death.

2236
01:54:43,210 --> 01:54:48,290
合在一起  便能主宰生死

2237
01:54:53,750 --> 01:54:57,070
That mark was on the grave in Godrics Hollow.

2238
01:54:53,750 --> 01:54:57,070
在戈德里克山谷的坟墓上也有那个标记

2239
01:54:59,610 --> 01:55:00,790
Um, Mr. Lovegood,

2240
01:54:59,610 --> 01:55:00,790
洛夫古德先生

2241
01:55:00,790 --> 01:55:01,781
does the Peverell family

2242
01:55:00,790 --> 01:55:01,781
佩弗利尔家族和

2243
01:55:01,782 --> 01:55:03,640
have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?

2244
01:55:01,782 --> 01:55:03,640
死亡圣器有什么关系吗

2245
01:55:06,870 --> 01:55:10,940
Ignotus, excuse me. And his brothers Cadmus and Antioch,

2246
01:55:06,870 --> 01:55:10,940
伊格诺图斯  借过  还有他的兄弟卡德摩斯和安提俄克

2247
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:13,830
thought to be the original owners of the Hallows,

2248
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:13,830
被认为是圣器最初的拥有者

2249
01:55:14,140 --> 01:55:15,690
and therefore the inspiration for the story.

2250
01:55:14,140 --> 01:55:15,690
因此也是这个故事的灵感来源

2251
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:20,050
But your tea has gone cold.

2252
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:20,050
你们的茶都凉了

2253
01:55:21,950 --> 01:55:23,730
I'll be right back.

2254
01:55:21,950 --> 01:55:23,730
我马上回来

2255
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:28,980
Let's get out of here.

2256
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:28,980
咱们快撤吧

2257
01:55:28,990 --> 01:55:30,945
I don't want to drink anymore of that stuff.

2258
01:55:28,990 --> 01:55:30,945
我再也不想喝那玩意了

2259
01:55:30,946 --> 01:55:32,300
Hot or cold.

2260
01:55:30,946 --> 01:55:32,300
管他是热的还是凉的

2261
01:55:38,630 --> 01:55:43,270
- Thank you, Sir. - You forgot the water.

2262
01:55:38,630 --> 01:55:43,270
-谢谢您  先生  -您忘记烧水了

2263
01:55:43,610 --> 01:55:46,140
- Water? - For the tea.

2264
01:55:43,610 --> 01:55:46,140
-什么水  -泡茶的水

2265
01:55:51,190 --> 01:55:52,500
How silly of me.

2266
01:55:51,190 --> 01:55:52,500
我真是太傻了

2267
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:57,060
It's really nice sir, but we really should be going any way.

2268
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:57,060
谢谢您的好意  但我们也该走了

2269
01:55:57,210 --> 01:55:58,375
No, you do not!

2270
01:55:57,210 --> 01:55:58,375
不  你们不能走

2271
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:04,580
Sir?

2272
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:04,580
先生

2273
01:56:12,630 --> 01:56:14,240
You're my only hope.

2274
01:56:12,630 --> 01:56:14,240
你是我唯一的希望

2275
01:56:19,110 --> 01:56:23,080
They were angry, you see, from what I've been writing.

2276
01:56:19,110 --> 01:56:23,080
我写的东西让他们很恼火

2277
01:56:26,270 --> 01:56:27,840
So they took her.

2278
01:56:26,270 --> 01:56:27,840
所以他们抓走了她

2279
01:56:29,870 --> 01:56:31,830
They took my children.

2280
01:56:29,870 --> 01:56:31,830
他们抓走了我的孩子

2281
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:35,180
My children.

2282
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:35,180
我的孩子

2283
01:56:48,470 --> 01:56:51,090
Oh, it's really you, then it'll work.

2284
01:56:48,470 --> 01:56:51,090
要真是你  就有救了

2285
01:56:53,710 --> 01:56:56,810
Who took her, sir?

2286
01:56:53,710 --> 01:56:56,810
谁把她抓走了  先生

2287
01:57:00,690 --> 01:57:02,360
Voldemort.

2288
01:57:00,690 --> 01:57:02,360
伏地魔

2289
01:57:14,380 --> 01:57:15,650
I got him!

2290
01:57:14,380 --> 01:57:15,650
我抓到他了

2291
01:57:32,580 --> 01:57:34,232
Treacherous little bleeder!

2292
01:57:32,580 --> 01:57:34,232
背信弃义的混球

2293
01:57:34,233 --> 01:57:36,050
Is there no one we can trust?

2294
01:57:34,233 --> 01:57:36,050
难道就没人可信了吗

2295
01:57:36,510 --> 01:57:38,780
They kidnapped her because he supported me.

2296
01:57:36,510 --> 01:57:38,780
卢娜是因为他支持我才被食死徒抓走的

2297
01:57:38,900 --> 01:57:40,350
He was just desperate.

2298
01:57:38,900 --> 01:57:40,350
他只是被逼无奈

2299
01:57:41,820 --> 01:57:43,260
I'll do the enchantments.

2300
01:57:41,820 --> 01:57:43,260
我去施防护魔法

2301
01:57:55,670 --> 01:57:57,050
Hello, beautiful.

2302
01:57:55,670 --> 01:57:57,050
你好啊  美女

2303
01:58:02,350 --> 01:58:05,360
Well, don't hang about. Snatch 'em.

2304
01:58:02,350 --> 01:58:05,360
别傻站着啊  抓住他们

2305
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:20,755
Harry. Tell me what to do.

2306
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:20,755
哈利  告诉我怎么做

2307
01:59:20,756 --> 01:59:22,190
Tell me, where it is.

2308
01:59:20,756 --> 01:59:22,190
告诉我它在哪里

2309
01:59:23,290 --> 01:59:25,940
Grindelwald. Grindelwald.

2310
01:59:23,290 --> 01:59:25,940
格林德瓦  格林德瓦

2311
01:59:28,910 --> 01:59:31,070
I knew you'd come, one day.

2312
01:59:28,910 --> 01:59:31,070
我知道总有一天你会来的

2313
01:59:31,590 --> 01:59:32,942
But surely you must know.

2314
01:59:31,590 --> 01:59:32,942
但你一定知道

2315
01:59:32,943 --> 01:59:35,140
I no longer have what you seek.

2316
01:59:32,943 --> 01:59:35,140
你要找的东西已不在我手里了

2317
01:59:35,740 --> 01:59:38,350
Tell me, Grindelwald, tell me where it is.

2318
01:59:35,740 --> 01:59:38,350
告诉我  格林德瓦  告诉我它在哪里

2319
01:59:38,650 --> 01:59:40,410
Tell me who possesses it.

2320
01:59:38,650 --> 01:59:40,410
告诉我谁拿了它

2321
01:59:40,810 --> 01:59:45,530
The elder wand lies with him, of course.

2322
01:59:40,810 --> 01:59:45,530
老魔杖当然和他在一起

2323
01:59:46,090 --> 01:59:47,750
Buried in the earth.

2324
01:59:46,090 --> 01:59:47,750
深埋地底

2325
01:59:49,170 --> 01:59:50,450
Dumbledore.

2326
01:59:49,170 --> 01:59:50,450
与邓布利多一起

2327
02:00:00,070 --> 02:00:01,398
The Hallows exist.

2328
02:00:00,070 --> 02:00:01,398
圣器真的存在

2329
02:00:01,776 --> 02:00:03,383
But he's only after one of them, the last one.

2330
02:00:01,776 --> 02:00:03,383
但他只在找最后一个

2331
02:00:03,550 --> 02:00:04,810
He knows where it is.

2332
02:00:03,550 --> 02:00:04,810
他知道它在哪里

2333
02:00:05,620 --> 02:00:06,920
He's gonna have it by the end of the night.

2334
02:00:05,620 --> 02:00:06,920
天亮之前他就会得到它

2335
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:08,380
You know who's had the elder wand?

2336
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:08,380
你知道老魔杖在谁那吗

2337
02:00:09,790 --> 02:00:12,048
- Don't touch her! - Leave him.

2338
02:00:09,790 --> 02:00:12,048
-不要碰她  -放开他

2339
02:00:12,083 --> 02:00:15,060
Your boyfriend will get much worse

2340
02:00:12,083 --> 02:00:15,060
如果你男朋友再不老实点的话

2341
02:00:15,060 --> 02:00:18,550
than that if he doesn't learn to behave himself.

2342
02:00:15,060 --> 02:00:18,550
可会吃更多苦头哦

2343
02:00:20,890 --> 02:00:22,380
What happened to you, ugly?

2344
02:00:20,890 --> 02:00:22,380
你的脸怎么了  丑八怪

2345
02:00:24,070 --> 02:00:25,270
No, not you.

2346
02:00:24,070 --> 02:00:25,270
不是说你

2347
02:00:27,370 --> 02:00:30,560
- What's your name? - Dudley. Vernon Dudley.

2348
02:00:27,370 --> 02:00:30,560
-你叫什么  -达力  弗农·达力

2349
02:00:30,750 --> 02:00:31,660
Check it.

2350
02:00:30,750 --> 02:00:31,660
查下名单

2351
02:00:34,490 --> 02:00:36,780
And you, my lovely.

2352
02:00:34,490 --> 02:00:36,780
你呢  我的小甜心

2353
02:00:39,870 --> 02:00:41,020
What do they call you?

2354
02:00:39,870 --> 02:00:41,020
他们叫你什么啊

2355
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:46,830
Penelope Clearwater, half-blood.

2356
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:46,830
珀涅罗珀·克里尔沃特  混血

2357
02:00:50,830 --> 02:00:52,350
There's no Vernon Dudley on here.

2358
02:00:50,830 --> 02:00:52,350
这上面没有弗农·达力

2359
02:00:53,610 --> 02:00:56,210
You hear that ugly? This says you're lying.

2360
02:00:53,610 --> 02:00:56,210
听到没  丑八怪  你在撒谎

2361
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:59,450
How come you don't want us to know who you are?

2362
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:59,450
为什么不想让我们知道你是谁呢

2363
02:00:59,450 --> 02:01:01,640
It's wrong, I told you who I am.

2364
02:00:59,450 --> 02:01:01,640
你弄错了  我已经说过我的名字了

2365
02:01:18,340 --> 02:01:19,460
Change of plan.

2366
02:01:18,340 --> 02:01:19,460
计划有变

2367
02:01:21,630 --> 02:01:23,870
We're not taking this lot to the Ministry.

2368
02:01:21,630 --> 02:01:23,870
不能把这些大鱼交给魔法部

2369
02:02:04,490 --> 02:02:07,100
Get, Draco.

2370
02:02:04,490 --> 02:02:07,100
把德拉科叫来

2371
02:02:12,680 --> 02:02:13,630
Well?

2372
02:02:12,680 --> 02:02:13,630
怎样

2373
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:18,380
I can't be sure.

2374
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:18,380
我不能确定

2375
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:21,030
Look closely, son.

2376
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:21,030
近点看  儿子

2377
02:02:22,790 --> 02:02:26,950
If we are the ones to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord.

2378
02:02:22,790 --> 02:02:26,950
如果我们能把波特交给黑魔王

2379
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:29,793
Everything would be forgiven,

2380
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:29,793
之前的一切都会一笔勾消

2381
02:02:29,794 --> 02:02:32,840
it would be as it was, understand?

2382
02:02:29,794 --> 02:02:32,840
我们还会像以前一样受宠  明白吗

2383
02:02:33,460 --> 02:02:35,797
Now we won't be forgetting who really actually caught him.

2384
02:02:33,460 --> 02:02:35,797
希望你不要忘了是谁抓到他的

2385
02:02:36,210 --> 02:02:38,170
I hope, Mr. Malfoy.

2386
02:02:36,210 --> 02:02:38,170
马尔福先生

2387
02:02:38,170 --> 02:02:41,330
- You dare to talk to me like that in my own house! - Lucius!

2388
02:02:38,170 --> 02:02:41,330
-你竟敢在我家这样跟我说话  -卢修斯

2389
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:47,930
Do not be shy, sweetie. Come closer.

2390
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:47,930
别害羞  宝贝  走近点看

2391
02:02:50,210 --> 02:02:51,866
Now, if this isn't who you think it is, Draco,

2392
02:02:50,210 --> 02:02:51,866
德拉科  要是我们把黑魔王叫来

2393
02:02:51,900 --> 02:02:55,690
and we call Him. He'll kill us all.

2394
02:02:51,900 --> 02:02:55,690
而他又不是波特  那我们就都完蛋

2395
02:02:55,690 --> 02:02:57,260
We need to be absolutely sure.

2396
02:02:55,690 --> 02:02:57,260
得确保万无一失

2397
02:02:58,570 --> 02:03:01,240
- What's wrong with his face? - Yes, what is wrong with his face?

2398
02:02:58,570 --> 02:03:01,240
-他的脸怎么回事  -是啊  他的脸怎么回事

2399
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:02,905
He came to us like that.

2400
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:02,905
我们抓到他时  他就这样

2401
02:03:02,906 --> 02:03:05,730
Something he picked up in the forest, I reckon.

2402
02:03:02,906 --> 02:03:05,730
我想是在树林里中了什么咒吧

2403
02:03:05,810 --> 02:03:08,530
An interesting jinx. Was it you, dear?

2404
02:03:05,810 --> 02:03:08,530
真不凑巧啊  是你干的吗  宝贝

2405
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:14,675
Give me her wand,

2406
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:14,675
把你的魔杖给我

2407
02:03:14,676 --> 02:03:16,460
let's see what your last spell was.

2408
02:03:14,676 --> 02:03:16,460
让我瞧瞧你最后施的什么咒语

2409
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:19,868
Got you.

2410
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:19,868
抓住你了

2411
02:03:23,990 --> 02:03:25,110
What's that?

2412
02:03:23,990 --> 02:03:25,110
那是什么

2413
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:28,760
Where'd you get that from?

2414
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:28,760
你在哪找到的

2415
02:03:28,890 --> 02:03:30,547
It was in her bag when we searched her.

2416
02:03:28,890 --> 02:03:30,547
从她包里搜出来的

2417
02:03:31,467 --> 02:03:32,539
I reckon it's mine now.

2418
02:03:31,467 --> 02:03:32,539
现在是我的了

2419
02:03:36,370 --> 02:03:37,450
Are you mad?

2420
02:03:36,370 --> 02:03:37,450
你疯了吗

2421
02:03:46,210 --> 02:03:48,220
Get out! Get out!

2422
02:03:46,210 --> 02:03:48,220
滚出去  滚

2423
02:03:56,260 --> 02:03:58,490
Cissy, put the boys in the cellar.

2424
02:03:56,260 --> 02:03:58,490
西茜  把这两个男孩关进地窖

2425
02:03:58,920 --> 02:04:01,600
I want a conversation with this one.

2426
02:03:58,920 --> 02:04:01,600
我要和她好好谈谈

2427
02:04:01,980 --> 02:04:03,520
Girl to girl!

2428
02:04:01,980 --> 02:04:03,520
姑娘间的谈话

2429
02:04:13,490 --> 02:04:14,112
What are we gonna do?

2430
02:04:13,490 --> 02:04:14,112
我们该怎么办

2431
02:04:14,113 --> 02:04:15,670
We can't leave Hermione alone with her.

2432
02:04:14,113 --> 02:04:15,670
不能让赫敏和她单独在一起

2433
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:17,500
Ron?

2434
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:17,500
罗恩

2435
02:04:23,220 --> 02:04:24,000
Harry?

2436
02:04:23,220 --> 02:04:24,000
哈利

2437
02:04:30,340 --> 02:04:31,460
Luna?

2438
02:04:30,340 --> 02:04:31,460
卢娜

2439
02:04:32,510 --> 02:04:35,550
That Sword is meant to be in my vault now,

2440
02:04:32,510 --> 02:04:35,550
那剑本该躺在我的金库里

2441
02:04:35,551 --> 02:04:36,970
how did you get it?

2442
02:04:35,551 --> 02:04:36,970
你是怎么得到的

2443
02:04:37,420 --> 02:04:42,230
Did you and your friend's take it from my vault?

2444
02:04:37,420 --> 02:04:42,230
你和你的朋友从我的金库里偷来的吗

2445
02:04:42,460 --> 02:04:45,680
I didn't take anything!

2446
02:04:42,460 --> 02:04:45,680
我什么都没拿

2447
02:04:45,900 --> 02:04:47,100
I don't believe you.

2448
02:04:45,900 --> 02:04:47,100
我才不信

2449
02:04:52,910 --> 02:04:55,370
- We have to do something! - There is no way out of here.

2450
02:04:52,910 --> 02:04:55,370
-我们得做点什么  -这里根本没有出路

2451
02:04:55,370 --> 02:04:58,760
We tried everything. It's enchanted.

2452
02:04:55,370 --> 02:04:58,760
我们试过各种方法  这里被施了魔法

2453
02:05:01,330 --> 02:05:02,420
You're bleeding, Harry.

2454
02:05:01,330 --> 02:05:02,420
你在流血  哈利

2455
02:05:02,420 --> 02:05:05,510
That's a curious thing to keep on yourself.

2456
02:05:02,420 --> 02:05:05,510
这种保持清醒的方法真稀奇啊

2457
02:05:14,700 --> 02:05:15,720
Help us!

2458
02:05:14,700 --> 02:05:15,720
救救我们

2459
02:05:21,490 --> 02:05:23,640
- Let her go. - You go, get back!

2460
02:05:21,490 --> 02:05:23,640
-放开她  -你滚开  退后

2461
02:05:24,750 --> 02:05:28,120
You, Goblin. Come with me.

2462
02:05:24,750 --> 02:05:28,120
小妖精  你跟我来

2463
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:52,020
Dobby? What are you doing here?

2464
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:52,020
多比  你怎么到这来了

2465
02:05:52,070 --> 02:05:54,630
Dobby's come to rescue, Harry Potter of course.

2466
02:05:52,070 --> 02:05:54,630
多比当然是来救你  哈利·波特

2467
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:57,350
Dobby will always be there for Harry Potter.

2468
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:57,350
多比会永远保护哈利·波特

2469
02:05:57,350 --> 02:05:59,580
Are you saying that you can apparate in and out of this room?

2470
02:05:57,350 --> 02:05:59,580
你是说你可以移形出入这个地牢吗

2471
02:05:59,910 --> 02:06:01,225
Could you take us with you?

2472
02:05:59,910 --> 02:06:01,225
你能带我们一起吗

2473
02:06:01,226 --> 02:06:02,900
Of course, sir, I'm a elf.

2474
02:06:01,226 --> 02:06:02,900
当然  先生  我是个精灵

2475
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:04,940
Works for me.

2476
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:04,940
我同意

2477
02:06:06,030 --> 02:06:07,774
Right, Dobby, I want you to take Luna and Mr. Ollivander...

2478
02:06:06,030 --> 02:06:07,774
很好  多比  我想让你带着卢娜和奥利凡德先生去...

2479
02:06:08,016 --> 02:06:09,944
Shell Cottage, on the outskirts of Tinworth.

2480
02:06:08,016 --> 02:06:09,944
贝壳小宅  在汀沃斯的近郊

2481
02:06:11,470 --> 02:06:12,400
Trust me.

2482
02:06:11,470 --> 02:06:12,400
相信我

2483
02:06:13,260 --> 02:06:14,680
When ever you're ready, sir.

2484
02:06:13,260 --> 02:06:14,680
整装待发了  先生

2485
02:06:15,220 --> 02:06:17,790
Sir? I like her very much!

2486
02:06:15,220 --> 02:06:17,790
你叫我先生吗  我真喜欢她

2487
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:25,550
Meet me at top of the stairs in ten seconds.

2488
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:25,550
十秒后在楼梯口见面

2489
02:06:42,490 --> 02:06:44,000
Who gets his wand?

2490
02:06:42,490 --> 02:06:44,000
谁要他的魔杖

2491
02:06:48,510 --> 02:06:51,660
I'm going to ask you once more, goblin.

2492
02:06:48,510 --> 02:06:51,660
我最后再问你一遍  小妖精

2493
02:06:51,730 --> 02:06:54,320
Think very, very carefully.

2494
02:06:51,730 --> 02:06:54,320
你要好好想清楚了

2495
02:06:54,340 --> 02:06:56,050
- How did they get there? - I don't know.

2496
02:06:54,340 --> 02:06:56,050
-他们是怎么进去的  -我不知道

2497
02:06:57,098 --> 02:07:00,540
You don't know? Why were you doing your job?

2498
02:06:57,098 --> 02:07:00,540
不知道  你吃白饭的啊

2499
02:07:00,620 --> 02:07:03,000
Who got into my vault?

2500
02:07:00,620 --> 02:07:03,000
谁闯入了我的金库

2501
02:07:05,020 --> 02:07:06,180
Who stole it?

2502
02:07:05,020 --> 02:07:06,180
谁偷了它

2503
02:07:06,330 --> 02:07:08,300
Who... Stole it?

2504
02:07:06,330 --> 02:07:08,300
谁  偷了它

2505
02:07:09,941 --> 02:07:13,090
It's impossible to break into Gringotts, the sword is there.

2506
02:07:09,941 --> 02:07:13,090
没人能闯入古灵阁  宝剑还在那里

2507
02:07:13,490 --> 02:07:16,090
泥巴种

2508
02:07:17,030 --> 02:07:20,230
Then how is it that it's out then?

2509
02:07:17,030 --> 02:07:20,230
那它怎么在这里

2510
02:07:20,300 --> 02:07:22,660
There is no place safer, than Gringotts.

2511
02:07:20,300 --> 02:07:22,660
没有比古灵阁更安全的地方了

2512
02:07:22,660 --> 02:07:23,497
Liar!

2513
02:07:22,660 --> 02:07:23,497
骗子

2514
02:07:25,473 --> 02:07:28,024
Consider yourself lucky, goblin.

2515
02:07:25,473 --> 02:07:28,024
算你走运  小妖精

2516
02:07:31,750 --> 02:07:36,030
- The same won't be said for this one. - Like hell!

2517
02:07:31,750 --> 02:07:36,030
-这一个可没这么幸运了  -去死吧

2518
02:07:37,340 --> 02:07:38,480
Expelliarmus.

2519
02:07:37,340 --> 02:07:38,480
除你武器

2520
02:07:40,270 --> 02:07:41,290
Stupefy!

2521
02:07:40,270 --> 02:07:41,290
昏昏倒地

2522
02:07:45,110 --> 02:07:46,110
Stop!

2523
02:07:45,110 --> 02:07:46,110
住手

2524
02:07:48,150 --> 02:07:49,290
Drop your wands.

2525
02:07:48,150 --> 02:07:49,290
放下魔杖

2526
02:07:52,710 --> 02:07:53,880
I said, drop them!

2527
02:07:52,710 --> 02:07:53,880
听到没  放下魔杖

2528
02:07:55,560 --> 02:07:58,730
Pick 'em up, Draco, now! Well, well, well.

2529
02:07:55,560 --> 02:07:58,730
德拉科  快去捡起来  好  很好

2530
02:07:59,100 --> 02:08:00,820
Look what we have here.

2531
02:07:59,100 --> 02:08:00,820
看看这是谁啊

2532
02:08:03,260 --> 02:08:04,390
It's Harry Potter.

2533
02:08:03,260 --> 02:08:04,390
是哈利·波特

2534
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:08,190
He's all bright, shiny and new again.

2535
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:08,190
他又焕然一新  神气十足了

2536
02:08:08,700 --> 02:08:11,590
Just in time for the Dark Lord.

2537
02:08:08,700 --> 02:08:11,590
是时候叫黑魔王来了

2538
02:08:11,830 --> 02:08:13,090
Call him.

2539
02:08:11,830 --> 02:08:13,090
召唤他

2540
02:08:17,740 --> 02:08:18,590
Call him.

2541
02:08:17,740 --> 02:08:18,590
召唤吧

2542
02:08:54,430 --> 02:08:55,800
Stupefy!

2543
02:08:54,430 --> 02:08:55,800
昏昏倒地

2544
02:08:57,530 --> 02:09:00,350
Stupid elf! You could have kill me!

2545
02:08:57,530 --> 02:09:00,350
蠢精灵  你差点杀了我

2546
02:09:00,350 --> 02:09:02,280
Dobby never meant to kill.

2547
02:09:00,350 --> 02:09:02,280
多比从不想杀任何人

2548
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:06,460
Dobby only meant to maim or seriously injure.

2549
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:06,460
多比只想把你弄残或是重伤

2550
02:09:09,240 --> 02:09:11,940
How dare you take a witch's wand.

2551
02:09:09,240 --> 02:09:11,940
你怎敢夺走巫师的魔杖

2552
02:09:12,260 --> 02:09:14,990
How dare you defy your masters.

2553
02:09:12,260 --> 02:09:14,990
你怎敢反抗你的主人

2554
02:09:15,390 --> 02:09:18,460
Dobby has no master.

2555
02:09:15,390 --> 02:09:18,460
多比没有主人

2556
02:09:18,630 --> 02:09:21,340
Dobby is a free elf.

2557
02:09:18,630 --> 02:09:21,340
多比是一个自由的精灵

2558
02:09:21,390 --> 02:09:25,640
And Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends.

2559
02:09:21,390 --> 02:09:25,640
多比是来救哈利·波特和他的朋友的

2560
02:09:55,940 --> 02:09:58,930
Hermione, are you all right?

2561
02:09:55,940 --> 02:09:58,930
赫敏  你们都还好吗

2562
02:09:59,060 --> 02:10:01,830
We're safe. We're all safe.

2563
02:09:59,060 --> 02:10:01,830
我们安全了  安全了

2564
02:10:03,670 --> 02:10:04,820
Harry Potter...

2565
02:10:03,670 --> 02:10:04,820
哈利·波特

2566
02:10:09,660 --> 02:10:10,450
Dobby!

2567
02:10:09,660 --> 02:10:10,450
多比

2568
02:10:21,980 --> 02:10:24,230
Dobby, you're all right then, hold on.

2569
02:10:21,980 --> 02:10:24,230
多比  你会好起来的  坚持住

2570
02:10:25,190 --> 02:10:26,120
Hold on, okay?

2571
02:10:25,190 --> 02:10:26,120
坚持住  好吗

2572
02:10:27,700 --> 02:10:30,940
Just hold on, okay? We're going to fix it.

2573
02:10:27,700 --> 02:10:30,940
再坚持一下  我们会治好你的

2574
02:10:32,310 --> 02:10:34,120
Hermione, you have something...

2575
02:10:32,310 --> 02:10:34,120
赫敏  你包里...

2576
02:10:35,030 --> 02:10:37,660
In your bag. Hermione!

2577
02:10:35,030 --> 02:10:37,660
一定有东西可以救他  赫敏

2578
02:10:38,707 --> 02:10:39,552
Come on.

2579
02:10:38,707 --> 02:10:39,552
说啊

2580
02:10:43,610 --> 02:10:44,336
Help me.

2581
02:10:43,610 --> 02:10:44,336
帮帮我

2582
02:10:48,250 --> 02:10:50,540
Such a beautiful place,

2583
02:10:48,250 --> 02:10:50,540
这地方真美

2584
02:10:53,190 --> 02:10:55,470
to be with friends.

2585
02:10:53,190 --> 02:10:55,470
还能和朋友们在一起

2586
02:10:57,410 --> 02:10:58,670
Dobby is happy,

2587
02:10:57,410 --> 02:10:58,670
多比很开心

2588
02:11:00,690 --> 02:11:03,320
to be with be with his friend,

2589
02:11:00,690 --> 02:11:03,320
能和朋友在一起

2590
02:11:05,540 --> 02:11:07,000
Harry Potter.

2591
02:11:05,540 --> 02:11:07,000
哈利·波特

2592
02:11:28,270 --> 02:11:30,260
We should close his eyes.

2593
02:11:28,270 --> 02:11:30,260
把他的眼睛阖上吧

2594
02:11:31,340 --> 02:11:32,420
Don't you think?

2595
02:11:31,340 --> 02:11:32,420
你觉得呢

2596
02:11:39,380 --> 02:11:41,740
There, now he could be sleeping.

2597
02:11:39,380 --> 02:11:41,740
好了  现在他可以安眠了

2598
02:11:58,030 --> 02:11:59,180
I want to bury him.

2599
02:11:58,030 --> 02:11:59,180
我想安葬他

2600
02:12:00,900 --> 02:12:03,800
Properly, without magic.

2601
02:12:00,900 --> 02:12:03,800
要让他去得体面  我要亲手安葬

2602
02:14:39,000 --> 02:20:00,000
