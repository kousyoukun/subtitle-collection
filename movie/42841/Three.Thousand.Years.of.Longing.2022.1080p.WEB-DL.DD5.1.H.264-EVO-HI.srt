1
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:39,576
[soft eerie music playing]

2
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:21,158
My name is A lit he a.

3
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:23,813
My story is true.

4
00:01:23,837 --> 00:01:26,206
You're more likely
to believe me, however,

5
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,450
if I tell it as a fairy tale.

6
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:33,735
So, once upon a time,

7
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,546
when humans hurtled
across the sky on metal wings,

8
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:39,786
when they wore webbed feet

9
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,159
and walked
on the bottom of the sea,

10
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:45,573
when they held
in their hands glass tiles

11
00:01:45,597 --> 00:01:48,141
that could coax
love songs from the air...

12
00:01:48,165 --> 00:01:49,838
[music playing
through headphones]

13
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:52,909
...there was a woman,
adequately happy and alone.

14
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,670
Alone by choice.

15
00:01:55,694 --> 00:01:58,587
Happy because
she was independent,

16
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,700
living off the exercise
of her scholarly mind.

17
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,444
Her business was story.

18
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:08,423
She was a narratologist

19
00:02:08,447 --> 00:02:10,207
who sought to find the truths

20
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:13,191
common to all the stories
of humankind.

21
00:02:14,453 --> 00:02:17,258
To this end,
once or twice a year,

22
00:02:17,282 --> 00:02:19,868
she ventured to strange lands.

23
00:02:19,893 --> 00:02:22,610
To China, the South Seas,

24
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:24,854
and the timeless cities
of the Levant...

25
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:33,429
where her kind gathered
to tell stories about stories.

26
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:37,147
[man 1] This way.

27
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:39,192
- [A lit he a] Excuse me.
- [man 1] This way, lady.

28
00:02:39,216 --> 00:02:40,847
What are you doing?
Can you let go, please?

29
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:43,283
The mysteries of Istanbul.

30
00:02:43,307 --> 00:02:45,460
[static buzzing]

31
00:02:45,484 --> 00:02:47,355
- [man 2] A lit he a!
- [man 1 grunts]

32
00:02:47,747 --> 00:02:48,966
A lit he a!

33
00:02:53,884 --> 00:02:55,514
Welcome!

34
00:02:55,538 --> 00:02:57,211
- Welcome at last! Aw.
- Gunhan!

35
00:02:57,235 --> 00:02:59,343
- [both laugh]
- My dear friend.

36
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:00,823
- [A lit he a] Oh, how wonderful!
- [Gunhan] I'm sorry.

37
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,520
- This is Amina.
- Amina.

38
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:04,329
From the British Council.

39
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:08,483
That fellow at the airport
manhandling my luggage,

40
00:03:08,507 --> 00:03:09,701
did you see him?

41
00:03:09,725 --> 00:03:10,943
What fellow?

42
00:03:12,336 --> 00:03:14,730
He scuttled off
when you arrived.

43
00:03:15,687 --> 00:03:19,953
Small, sheepskin jacket,
pink collar.

44
00:03:22,521 --> 00:03:23,695
Interesting.

45
00:03:24,653 --> 00:03:26,917
He was hot to touch.

46
00:03:28,004 --> 00:03:29,311
Musky.

47
00:03:29,832 --> 00:03:31,506
Perhaps he was a djinn.

48
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,986
An illegal taxi driver,
more likely.

49
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,944
Wearing too much cologne.

50
00:03:35,968 --> 00:03:37,817
So, Professor,

51
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:40,341
you saying you believe in djinn?

52
00:03:40,365 --> 00:03:43,257
I believe there are those
who need to believe in them.

53
00:03:43,281 --> 00:03:44,389
Including me?

54
00:03:44,413 --> 00:03:45,805
Djinn, ghosts,

55
00:03:46,632 --> 00:03:48,591
aliens, whatever helps.

56
00:03:51,507 --> 00:03:52,942
[Gunhan laughs]

57
00:03:54,987 --> 00:03:57,774
The hotel's arranged
a lovely surprise for you.

58
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,887
It's the Agatha Christie room.

59
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,193
In this room,

60
00:04:06,217 --> 00:04:08,828
she wrote
Murder on the Orient Express.

61
00:04:13,442 --> 00:04:14,723
[sighs]

62
00:04:14,747 --> 00:04:16,725
[audience laughing]

63
00:04:16,749 --> 00:04:18,858
[Gunhan chuckles]

64
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:21,600
[Gunhan] So,
how would you explain

65
00:04:21,624 --> 00:04:23,992
the power of a thunderstorm

66
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:25,386
if you don't have the means

67
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,891
to measure and model
meteorological data?

68
00:04:29,632 --> 00:04:31,783
How can you explain the seasons?

69
00:04:31,807 --> 00:04:34,569
Autumn through winter
to spring and summer,

70
00:04:34,593 --> 00:04:36,745
if you don't know that the Earth

71
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:39,423
orbits the Sun
while tilted on an axis?

72
00:04:40,598 --> 00:04:42,663
Everything was mystery.

73
00:04:42,687 --> 00:04:47,755
The seasons, tsunamis,
microbial disease...

74
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:51,846
What else could we do
but resort to stories?

75
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,894
As Dr. Binnie has
encouraged us to understand,

76
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:56,983
stories were once the only way

77
00:04:57,007 --> 00:04:59,550
to make our bewildering
existence coherent.

78
00:04:59,574 --> 00:05:01,334
That's exactly right.

79
00:05:01,358 --> 00:05:04,033
We gave name
to the unknown forces

80
00:05:04,057 --> 00:05:07,079
behind all wonder
and catastrophe,

81
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:09,497
by telling each other...

82
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:15,915
By telling each other stories.

83
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:17,699
- [Gunhan] let me show you.
- [static buzzes]

84
00:05:17,723 --> 00:05:22,442
We told tales of specific,
powerful, relatable gods

85
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:25,838
ever present in all cultures,
in all mythologies,

86
00:05:25,862 --> 00:05:28,884
from the Greeks,
to the Romans, to the Norse,

87
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:30,755
and so on, and so on.

88
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:34,106
The familiar descendant
of Zeus, Poseidon, Athena,

89
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,675
Thor, the whole gang,

90
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:39,329
find expression even today.

91
00:05:39,353 --> 00:05:40,808
[low electrical humming]

92
00:05:40,832 --> 00:05:43,661
These are their vestiges.

93
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:48,841
The question remains,
what is their purpose?

94
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:54,387
[electrical humming continues]

95
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:56,370
What do we require of them now?

96
00:05:58,547 --> 00:06:01,699
There is mythos,
and there is science.

97
00:06:01,723 --> 00:06:03,658
[electrical humming stops]

98
00:06:03,682 --> 00:06:06,139
[A lit he a softly] Oh. Sorry.

99
00:06:06,163 --> 00:06:10,622
Mythology is what
we knew back then.

100
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:13,754
Science is what we know so far.

101
00:06:13,778 --> 00:06:15,954
[low electrical humming resumes]

102
00:06:18,435 --> 00:06:20,762
Sooner or later,

103
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:23,591
our creation stories
are replaced

104
00:06:23,615 --> 00:06:25,529
by the narratives of science.

105
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:28,901
Painstaking science.

106
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:30,927
And all gods and monsters

107
00:06:31,927 --> 00:06:34,103
outlive their original purpose

108
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:37,562
and are reduced to metaphor.

109
00:06:37,586 --> 00:06:39,762
Rubbish! [Roars]

110
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:44,090
[Gunhan muffled] A lit he a!

111
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:45,942
[woman speaking indistinctly]

112
00:06:48,204 --> 00:06:49,511
[Gunhan] A lit he a.

113
00:06:50,555 --> 00:06:51,706
[woman] What happened?

114
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,141
[Gunhan] I don't know.
She just fell.

115
00:06:53,165 --> 00:06:55,057
- She just fell.
- [Amina grunts]

116
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,127
[Amina] Gosh. [Exclaiming]

117
00:07:04,002 --> 00:07:05,483
[Gunhan] Are you okay?

118
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:08,180
[audience clapping]

119
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:14,665
[rattling]

120
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:17,514
[Gunhan] Shouldn't
you see a doctor?

121
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,038
[A lit he a] Why?
When I feel so well?

122
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:21,475
[Gunhan] Forgive me, A lit he a.
Are you sure?

123
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:23,737
[A lit he a] Apart from
the usual aches and pains,

124
00:07:23,762 --> 00:07:25,435
there is nothing untoward.

125
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:27,132
There's no reason
to make a fuss.

126
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:29,028
[Gunhan] So, what happened
back there?

127
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,992
Lately, my imagination's
been getting the better of me.

128
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:39,711
Ambushing me.

129
00:07:39,735 --> 00:07:40,886
I think it's a warning.

130
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,172
About what?

131
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:45,586
Not to be complacent.

132
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,935
To keep on my toes.

133
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:50,591
It manifests rudely
from time to time.

134
00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:53,158
I try not to fight it off.

135
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:56,988
It takes charge for a moment,
and then it steps back.

136
00:07:57,012 --> 00:07:58,555
What steps back?

137
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:01,670
Oh, Gunhan, it's
irrational. Pay it no mind.

138
00:08:04,107 --> 00:08:06,519
[Gunhan] You are behaving like
a child. Do you know that?

139
00:08:06,543 --> 00:08:07,956
[A lit he a] You know,
I am actually a child.

140
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,523
[Gunhan laughs]

141
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:12,264
[people chattering indistinctly]

142
00:08:12,288 --> 00:08:15,204
[A lit he a] If there is fate,
can we escape it?

143
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:17,206
Who can say?

144
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,012
But I tell you this,

145
00:08:20,036 --> 00:08:22,230
in the Grand Bazaar of Istanbul,

146
00:08:22,254 --> 00:08:27,149
there are 62 streets
and 4,000 shops.

147
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,307
And in one of those shops,
there are three rooms.

148
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:33,198
In the smallest of those rooms,

149
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:35,809
there was a pile
of things unsorted,

150
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:37,532
old and new.

151
00:08:38,576 --> 00:08:40,534
From the bottom of that pile,

152
00:08:41,536 --> 00:08:43,145
I chose a memento.

153
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,825
Do you know what this is?

154
00:08:50,849 --> 00:08:53,697
I'm not sure,
but it could be Cesm-i Bulbul,

155
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:55,221
a "Nightingale's Eye."

156
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:58,572
Around 1845, there were
these glassmakers in Incirkoy.

157
00:08:58,596 --> 00:09:01,182
They were famous for this
spiral blue-white pattern.

158
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:03,229
Oh, please.
It's a gift from me.

159
00:09:03,253 --> 00:09:05,124
Choose something less forlorn.

160
00:09:08,562 --> 00:09:12,325
And, uh, if this
is Cesm-i Bulbul,

161
00:09:12,349 --> 00:09:14,849
uh, is there a way
of authenticating it?

162
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:16,590
Well, they say
that if it is genuine,

163
00:09:16,614 --> 00:09:18,591
sometimes you can see
specks of blood

164
00:09:18,615 --> 00:09:20,028
from the lungs

- Yes, but no crusts.

No.

269

he came to me,
out of an emptiness.

Out of a need to imagine.

275

that only we two spoke.

277
00:16:44,105 --> 00:16:46,256
And he always disappeared
when I had a headache,

278

[breathing laboriously]

285
00:17:01,164 --> 00:17:04,472
I feared he would leave,
and so I wrote him down.

286
00:17:06,518 --> 00:17:11,132
And I filled this journal,
bulging with facts.

287
00:17:12,523 --> 00:17:16,678
But the more realism
I tried to insert,

288
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:19,681
the more I began to doubt,

289

and, uh, it all began
to feel silly.

I felt silly.

291

So, after a time,

292
00:17:30,193 --> 00:17:32,544
I burned it all
in the school furnace.

293
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,548
And after that,
he disappeared altogether.

294

And yet, I am here.

That's so kind. Thank you.

...this afternoon,
when you get a chance.

That was my third incarceration.

331
00:19:55,817 --> 00:19:57,883
You've been trapped
in a bottle three times?

332
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:00,232
I may be a djinn,
but I'm also a fool

333
00:20:00,257 --> 00:20:02,844
with too great a fondness
for the conversation of women.

334
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:05,238
I need to be more careful
in the future.

335
00:20:05,261 --> 00:20:06,781
How were you caught
in the first place?

336
00:20:07,525 --> 00:20:09,199
By desire.

337
00:20:09,222 --> 00:20:10,875
How else?

338
00:20:13,749 --> 00:20:15,335
Who was she?

339
00:20:15,358 --> 00:20:16,815
Sheba.

340
00:20:16,838 --> 00:20:18,208
The Queen of Sheba?

341
00:20:18,231 --> 00:20:19,730
She was my kin.

342
00:20:19,755 --> 00:20:20,862
She was a djinn?

343
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:22,385
Her mother was a djinn.

344
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,473
Is that possible?

345
00:20:23,498 --> 00:20:24,692
There are laws that allow

346
00:20:24,715 --> 00:20:26,215
the union of djinn and mortals,

347
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,955
but they cannot produce
an immortal scion

348
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,261
the way a donkey and a horse

349
00:20:29,286 --> 00:20:31,244
can only produce
a seedless mule.

350
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:36,008
So, what did she look like?

351
00:20:36,031 --> 00:20:40,230
Other than a thick glade
of black hair on her legs,

352
00:20:40,253 --> 00:20:41,622
she looked like
any other human being,

353
00:20:41,645 --> 00:20:43,929
except, of course,
she was Sheba.

354
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:46,539
By all accounts,
she was very beautiful.

355
00:20:46,564 --> 00:20:49,523
She was not beautiful.
She was beauty itself.

356
00:20:53,048 --> 00:20:55,854
I was in every way free.

357
00:20:55,877 --> 00:20:58,881
I would come in and out
of her sleeping chamber.

358
00:21:00,011 --> 00:21:02,537
[whispers] Sheba...

359
00:21:04,278 --> 00:21:05,993
[blows]

360
00:21:06,018 --> 00:21:08,910
I knew as well as any
of her female slaves

361
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:11,936
the touches that made
her shiver with bliss.

362
00:21:13,068 --> 00:21:15,593
Never have I wanted
a creature so.

363
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,875
And she desired you in return?

364
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,270
I was her plaything.
Her confidante.

365
00:21:21,295 --> 00:21:23,534
I might have become more,
but for Solomon.

366
00:21:23,557 --> 00:21:24,751
King Solomon?

367
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:26,753
Blessed be his memory.

368
00:21:26,778 --> 00:21:29,017
He came from across
the deserts to woo her.

369
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,323
Didn't she go to him?

370
00:21:30,346 --> 00:21:31,672
No. Never.

371
00:21:31,695 --> 00:21:33,500
But it's in all the holy books.

372
00:21:33,523 --> 00:21:34,980
All the stories
and the paintings.

373
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:36,763
And Handel wrote music about it.

374
00:21:36,788 --> 00:21:38,375
Madam, I was there.

375
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:40,072
Solomon came to her.

376
00:21:40,096 --> 00:21:42,814
[people chattering in distance]

379
00:22:07,471 --> 00:22:09,430
[The Djinn in English]
he began with music.

380
00:22:10,431 --> 00:22:12,519

381
00:22:14,347 --> 00:22:15,977
[music intensifying]

[music stops abruptly]

383
00:22:28,449 --> 00:22:31,538
[playing sentimental music]

384
00:23:01,525 --> 00:23:04,093

00:23:30,467 --> 00:23:32,163
[music ends in flourish]

386
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:39,126
[gulps]

387
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,457
I did all that I could
to dissuade her.

388
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,588
But when she used

389
00:23:45,613 --> 00:23:47,460
the scented wax
of the Jabassa Bee

390
00:23:47,483 --> 00:23:49,027
to remove the hair
from her legs,

391
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,723
I knew that I was lost.

392
00:23:50,748 --> 00:23:53,074
But I, like a fool,
went on telling her

393
00:23:53,097 --> 00:23:56,076
that her body
was rich and lovely,

394
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,731
but her mind
was richer and lovelier,

395
00:23:58,756 --> 00:24:00,517
and more durable.

396
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,605
And she agreed
with all that I said,

397
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,240
and dropped a hot tear.

398
00:24:05,633 --> 00:24:08,612
She began to set him tasks,
which seemed impossible,

399
00:24:08,635 --> 00:24:10,743
to find a particular thread
of red silk

400
00:24:10,768 --> 00:24:12,746
in the palace
of a thousand rooms,

401
00:24:12,769 --> 00:24:15,618
to guess the secret name
of her mother djinn,

402
00:24:15,643 --> 00:24:18,925
[inhales] to tell her
what women most desire.

403
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,798
That does seem impossible.

404
00:24:20,821 --> 00:24:22,059
Not for him.

405
00:24:22,084 --> 00:24:23,583
He could speak
to the beasts of the earth,

406
00:24:23,606 --> 00:24:26,019
and to the djinn
made of subtle fire.

407
00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:29,109
He found ants to discover
the thread of silk,

408
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,199
and an ifrit to whisper
the mother's name.

409
00:24:31,222 --> 00:24:33,661
[ifrit speaking indistinctly]

410
00:24:36,532 --> 00:24:38,031
[The Djinn] Then he looked
into her eyes

411
00:24:38,056 --> 00:24:41,122
and told her
what women most desire.

412
00:24:41,145 --> 00:24:43,211
[King Solomon speaking
early Aramaic]

413
00:24:43,234 --> 00:24:44,846
[The Djinn] She was astonished,

414
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:48,022
and told him he was right.

415
00:24:52,548 --> 00:24:56,049
And so she granted him
what he most desired,

416
00:24:56,074 --> 00:24:58,947
which was to wed her
and be taken to her bed.

417
00:25:02,906 --> 00:25:04,102
[Sheba gasps]

418
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:06,693

[speaks early Aramaic]

422
00:25:19,054 --> 00:25:20,814
[The Djinn]
He was a great magician...

423
00:25:20,837 --> 00:25:22,294
- [wheezing]
- ...and imprisoned me

424
00:25:22,317 --> 00:25:25,538
with a word of power
into a brass bottle.

425
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,588
[emotional string
music continues]

426
00:25:51,694 --> 00:25:53,827
She made no plea for me.

427
00:25:54,828 --> 00:25:57,198
I was nothing to her.

428
00:25:57,221 --> 00:25:59,136
A breath in a bottle.

429
00:26:13,891 --> 00:26:16,653
And so, I was cast
into the Red Sea

430
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:20,288
and languished for 2,500 years.

431
00:26:25,642 --> 00:26:27,228
Apart from sleep,

432
00:26:27,251 --> 00:26:30,211
what does one do in a bottle
for 2,500 years?

433
00:26:31,734 --> 00:26:33,258
Djinn don't sleep.

434
00:26:38,915 --> 00:26:40,614
So, how do you manage then?

435
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,354
[clicks tongue]

436
00:26:43,921 --> 00:26:48,641
Well, for the first 100 years,
I rage against my fate.

437
00:26:48,664 --> 00:26:50,382
I pray to Boschkolo
for my release,

438
00:26:50,405 --> 00:26:51,817
and when that does not work,

439
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:53,298
I pray to any god I know,

440
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:55,256
and then to any god
I may not know.

441
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,954
And when, still,
I find no answers,

442
00:26:57,979 --> 00:26:59,042
[inhales]

443
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:01,132
I spend my time in waking dreams

444
00:27:01,155 --> 00:27:03,916
revisiting all the stories
of my life.

445
00:27:03,941 --> 00:27:06,876
And when I have exhausted this
many, many times,

446
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:09,923
I return to my prayer
and my rage.

447
00:27:09,946 --> 00:27:12,906
And then, finally,

448
00:27:14,256 --> 00:27:16,387
I play a trick on myself.

449
00:27:17,825 --> 00:27:19,279
I pray to remain in the bottle.

450
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:23,109
I beseech Boschkolo to keep me
always in the bottle.

451
00:27:23,134 --> 00:27:24,676
And does that work?

452
00:27:24,701 --> 00:27:26,156
To yearn for nothing?

453
00:27:26,181 --> 00:27:28,028
To pretend to want nothing more

454
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:29,769
than to be contained
in a bottle?

455
00:27:29,792 --> 00:27:31,249
No.

456
00:27:31,272 --> 00:27:34,015
For a djinn, it is the closest
we ever come to death.

457
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,863
[sighs]

458
00:27:36,886 --> 00:27:38,647
Do you know the answer
to her question?

459
00:27:38,672 --> 00:27:39,823
What women most desire?

460
00:27:39,846 --> 00:27:40,953
Yeah.

461
00:27:40,978 --> 00:27:42,694
Do you not know?

462
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:44,218
If you do not know,
I cannot tell you.

463
00:27:44,241 --> 00:27:46,394
Well, surely, we don't
all want the same thing.

464
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:50,007
Madam, your yearnings
are not at all clear to me.

465
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:53,314
I... I'm at a point in my life
where I have all I need.

466
00:27:53,337 --> 00:27:55,882
I daresay I'm content,
and gratefully so.

467
00:27:55,905 --> 00:27:57,013
Tell me.

468
00:27:57,038 --> 00:27:59,406
Are you a wife? A widow?

469
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:01,671
- Um...
- A mother, perhaps?

470
00:28:01,694 --> 00:28:04,219
I have no children,
no siblings, no parents.

471
00:28:06,002 --> 00:28:07,285
I did once have a husband.

472
00:28:07,308 --> 00:28:08,547
[The Djinn] Ah.

473
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,703
And what was the complexion
of this husband?

474
00:28:11,226 --> 00:28:12,682
His complexion?

475
00:28:12,705 --> 00:28:15,858
In the beginning,
it was glowing.

476
00:28:15,883 --> 00:28:17,686
And in the ending?

477
00:28:17,711 --> 00:28:19,210
It's not much of a story.

478
00:28:19,233 --> 00:28:22,125
But it is a story.
It is your story,

479
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,779
and it is always wise

480
00:28:23,804 --> 00:28:25,738
to understand those
who have a hold on you.

481
00:28:25,761 --> 00:28:26,826
Please.

482
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:27,938
[inhales deeply]

483
00:28:29,026 --> 00:28:31,246
[grunts] Well, okay, um...

484
00:28:32,334 --> 00:28:33,702
[smacks lips]

485
00:28:33,727 --> 00:28:36,182
We'd known each other
since our youth.

486
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:38,055
We, uh, married early.

487
00:28:38,078 --> 00:28:40,012
In the beginning,
we took pleasure

488
00:28:40,037 --> 00:28:41,840
in each other's minds
and bodies.

489
00:28:41,865 --> 00:28:43,190
Um...

490
00:28:43,213 --> 00:28:45,018
We passed the years comfortably,

491
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:47,435
and then as it happens,

492
00:28:48,175 --> 00:28:50,197
it all evaporated,

493
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:52,267
and, uh... and we became

494
00:28:53,397 --> 00:28:54,419
less.

495
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:55,442
And where is he?

496
00:28:57,141 --> 00:29:00,076
He's in Hackney,
with Emmeline Porter.

497
00:29:00,101 --> 00:29:01,276
[The Djinn] Mmm.

498
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,323
[A lit he a sighs]

499
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,390
[A lit he a] He told me I...

500
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:11,871
I was incapable
of reading feelings.

501
00:29:11,894 --> 00:29:13,046

[car horn beeps]

503

I was incapable

[Emmeline] ...gonna have
a resolution.

505
00:29:20,295 --> 00:29:21,445
[Jack] This is exciting!

506
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,012
- It is exciting!
- [Emmeline] No, it's not.

507
00:29:23,037 --> 00:29:24,449
Let me guess.
No one dies in it.

508
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:26,190
[Emmeline laughing] No!

509
00:29:26,213 --> 00:29:30,019
[A lit he a] The way my brain
is wired is... is the...

510
00:29:30,044 --> 00:29:33,022
the source both of my power

511
00:29:33,047 --> 00:29:35,788
and, uh, and my solitude.

512
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:38,965
I suspect that's why
I like stories.

513
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,509
I find feelings through stories.

514
00:29:42,534 --> 00:29:44,884
[The Djinn sighs]

515
00:29:46,103 --> 00:29:49,038
Perhaps you could
wish for him back.

516
00:29:49,063 --> 00:29:51,194
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no.

517
00:29:51,368 --> 00:29:52,457
No.

518
00:29:53,545 --> 00:29:56,200
I... I thought, um,

519
00:29:57,288 --> 00:30:01,117
I might grieve
a loss and betrayal, but, uh,

520
00:30:02,423 --> 00:30:04,121
no, in fact, I was free.

521
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:07,839
I was like a prisoner

522
00:30:07,864 --> 00:30:11,451
emerging from a dungeon
into the sunlight.

523
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,280
I expanded into the space
of my own life.

524
00:30:14,305 --> 00:30:18,459
No, I could not wish for more.

525
00:30:18,482 --> 00:30:21,461
You are a wise
and cautious woman, A lit he a.

526
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,116
But we all have desires,

527
00:30:24,141 --> 00:30:26,012
even if they remain
hidden from us.

528

[inhales sharply]

529
00:30:28,144 --> 00:30:29,949
That's as maybe.

530
00:30:29,972 --> 00:30:34,866
But I am also a narratologist,

531
00:30:34,891 --> 00:30:37,347
and that is going
to be a problem.

532
00:30:37,372 --> 00:30:39,611
It's going to be
a very big problem.

533
00:30:39,634 --> 00:30:41,830
See, I know
all the stories there are

534
00:30:41,855 --> 00:30:43,180
about trickster djinn,

535
00:30:43,203 --> 00:30:44,484
and the ways in which
they manipulate wishing

536
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,573
to their own ends.

537
00:30:45,596 --> 00:30:46,878
I am not one of them.

538
00:30:46,903 --> 00:30:48,837
I am god-fearing and honorable,

539
00:30:48,862 --> 00:30:51,101
and only here
to grant your heart's desire.

540
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:53,190
Well, even if that's true,

541
00:30:53,213 --> 00:30:56,391
how can you rely on those
called upon to wish?

[speaks ancient Greek]

543
00:30:58,435 --> 00:31:01,221
How do you know
you can rely on me?

544
00:31:02,353 --> 00:31:04,375
Well, I hope so.

545
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:07,203
With you, I certainly hope so.

546
00:31:07,228 --> 00:31:09,423
There's a...

547
00:31:09,446 --> 00:31:12,338
funny little story.
I mean, you probably know it.

548
00:31:12,363 --> 00:31:14,298
Three friends lost at sea
in a tiny boat.

549
00:31:14,321 --> 00:31:16,038
They pull up a magic fish,

550
00:31:16,063 --> 00:31:17,605
who grants each of them
one wish.

551
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:18,737
The first one,

552
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,520
"I wish I were at home
with my wife."

553
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,695
He vanishes.

554
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,307
The second one,
"I wish I were playing"

555
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,612
"in the fields
with my children."

556
00:31:24,635 --> 00:31:25,830
Off he goes.

557
00:31:25,855 --> 00:31:28,355
And the third one,
"I miss my friends..."

558
00:31:28,378 --> 00:31:29,400
"I wish they were here."

559
00:31:29,423 --> 00:31:31,054
You've got it.

560
00:31:31,077 --> 00:31:34,317
There's no story about wishing
that is not a cautionary tale.

561
00:31:34,342 --> 00:31:36,232
None end happily.

562
00:31:36,257 --> 00:31:38,147
Not even the ones
that are supposed to be jokes.

563
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:40,453
But you and I
are the authors of this story,

564
00:31:40,478 --> 00:31:43,002
and we can avoid all traps.

565
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,094
Well, what if
I made no wish at all?

566

00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:13,969
So he died?

821
00:48:13,992 --> 00:48:15,342
Not in battle.

822
00:48:15,951 --> 00:48:17,188
Back in Istanbul,

823
00:48:17,213 --> 00:48:19,322
Kosem needs
to protect the throne.

824
00:48:19,346 --> 00:48:21,150
She needs to protect Ibrahim.

825
00:48:21,173 --> 00:48:23,021
- [A lit he a] The little brother?
- [The Djinn] Yes.

826
00:48:23,045 --> 00:48:25,438
[Ibrahim breathing heavily]

827
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,963
He is last of the Ottoman line.

828
00:48:29,965 --> 00:48:32,271
He has to produce male children.

829
00:48:34,927 --> 00:48:39,452
So, Kosem locks him in a cage
lined entirely with sable.

830
00:48:46,981 --> 00:48:48,568
[A lit he a] Quite the prison.

831
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,072
[The Djinn] And one
he will never want to leave.

832
00:48:53,422 --> 00:48:55,121
[Ibrahim sniffs]

833
00:49:06,523 --> 00:49:08,936
It debauches him royally.

834
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,590
He believes the greater
the expanse of flesh,

835
00:49:11,614 --> 00:49:13,289
the more intense the pleasure.

836
00:49:13,313 --> 00:49:17,248
So, Kosem seeks out beauties
voluptuous and immense,

837
00:49:17,273 --> 00:49:20,469
and brings them to his couch.

838
00:49:20,494 --> 00:49:24,474
My fate turns specifically
on this fetish.

And though
he returns a conqueror,

847
00:50:02,188 --> 00:50:04,798
he cannot shed
his robes of blood.

848
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,474
War had truly rotted his soul.

I am determined to draw him
back to the stone.

853

I don't want to interrupt,
but I do have a question.

Did it matter to you
what kind of wish

855

such a man might make?

856
00:50:40,661 --> 00:50:42,507
One so insatiable.

857
00:50:42,532 --> 00:50:44,335
No.

858
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,295
Not even if
it were profoundly evil?

859
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:47,818
Not if it meant my freedom.

860
00:50:47,842 --> 00:50:51,715
The truth is he has
other things on his mind.

861
00:50:53,369 --> 00:50:55,652
He believes he is invincible,

862

and to rule indefinitely,
he must be rid of all rivals.

First, she arranges for him
to be perpetually drunk.

And then she tries
something very shrewd.

You say you're not a trickster,

985
00:59:28,753 --> 00:59:32,123
and you say that you and I
are the authors of this story.

986
00:59:32,148 --> 00:59:35,170
But I'm not able
to write myself out of it.

987
00:59:35,195 --> 00:59:36,432
Correct.

988
00:59:36,456 --> 00:59:40,175
Why don't you just hop back
into your bottle

989
00:59:40,199 --> 00:59:41,916
and I'll give it
to someone more gullible?

990
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:44,876
Someone more desperate.
Someone more greedy.

991
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,050
I'm not getting back
in the bottle.

992
00:59:46,074 --> 00:59:47,139
Why not?

993
00:59:47,163 --> 00:59:48,967
I'm not getting back
in the bottle.

994
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:50,969
Well, I am not
making three wishes.

995
00:59:50,992 --> 00:59:53,144
Then you are sending me
to my oblivion.

996
00:59:53,168 --> 00:59:54,625
Oh, you're impossible.

997
00:59:54,648 --> 00:59:56,626
And you are giving me
a headache.

998
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:58,324
All right. All right.

999
00:59:58,347 --> 01:00:00,891
Here's what I'll do.
I will make three wishes.

1000
01:00:00,916 --> 01:00:02,023
- I will.
- Before you die?

1001
01:00:02,047 --> 01:00:03,807
Right now.
One after the other.

1002
01:00:03,831 --> 01:00:05,027
- Ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

1003
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:07,748
Number one. I wish
your headache were gone.

1004
01:00:10,751 --> 01:00:12,338
Number two.

1005
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:14,320
I wish for a sip of this tea.

1006
01:00:16,757 --> 01:00:19,780
And finally, I wish
for another one of those.

1007
01:00:19,804 --> 01:00:21,130
You mock me.

1008
01:00:21,153 --> 01:00:22,827
Three wishes, perfectly simple,

1009
01:00:22,851 --> 01:00:23,958
and theoretically safe.

1010
01:00:23,983 --> 01:00:26,047
I was imprisoned
by Solomon precisely

1011
01:00:26,072 --> 01:00:28,702
because I cried out
my heart's desire.

1012
01:00:28,726 --> 01:00:31,619
Only by granting you yours
may I earn my release.

1013
01:00:31,643 --> 01:00:33,054
Yes, well,
I appreciate the symmetry,

1014
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:34,621
but the thing is this,

1015
01:00:34,646 --> 01:00:37,407
I cannot for the life of me
summon up one eligible wish.

1016
01:00:37,431 --> 01:00:38,887
And you're asking me for three.

1017
01:00:38,911 --> 01:00:41,150
Is there any life in you?
Are you even alive?

1018
01:00:41,173 --> 01:00:42,978
You know, in some cultures,

1019
01:00:43,001 --> 01:00:44,719
absence of desire
means enlightenment.

1020
01:00:44,742 --> 01:00:46,938
Then you are a pious fool.

1021
01:00:46,961 --> 01:00:49,201
If I'm content, why tempt fate?

1022
01:00:49,224 --> 01:00:50,637
And you're a coward.

1023
01:00:50,661 --> 01:00:51,987
Don't goad me.

1024
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:53,945
There is no human,
no angel, nor djinn

1025

that wouldn't grasp
at the chance

to fulfill
their deepest longings,

1027
01:00:56,885 --> 01:00:58,340
and I am saddled with the one

1028
01:00:58,364 --> 01:00:59,864

nothing at all.

Who was it this time?

She was Zefir.

01:02:09,523 --> 01:02:13,396
Rarely among humankind
has there been such a wonder.

1051
01:02:14,483 --> 01:02:17,269
But you're here
because of her folly.

[tuts and sighs]

I ended up in this
as a consequence of Zefir.

1054
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,777
And this is the story

1055

you've been avoiding
telling me all along.

1056

This is the story I've avoided

[hooves clopping]

1058

Zefir was a foundling,

01:02:48,954 --> 01:02:51,521
married at 12
to a wealthy merchant.

1060
01:02:53,132 --> 01:02:55,327
He was much older than her,
and kind,

1061
01:02:55,351 --> 01:03:00,811
if you think keeping someone
like a bird in a cage is kind.

1062
01:03:00,835 --> 01:03:03,465
There were two older wives,
who did not like her

[Zefir panting

She had neither

She grew to no great beauty

1070
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:47,969
and was angry
without knowing why.

As the fates would have it,
my bottle came to her

1075
01:04:05,204 --> 01:04:08,554
as a love token
from her husband.

1076
01:04:13,603 --> 01:04:16,626
And when she had finished
satisfying him

1077
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:18,106
and was finally alone,

1078

she managed to prise it open.

It was as if
she was waiting for me.

1080

I saw at once
that she was sharp,

1081
01:04:57,211 --> 01:05:01,061
and she saw that I was desperate

1082
01:05:01,085 --> 01:05:03,280
for freedom and conversation.

1083
01:05:03,304 --> 01:05:06,023
I told her my story,
as I have told you,

[The Djinn] There was something
more important to her.

1163

She had devised a "mathematica,"

She was Promethean, brave.

But she could not solve
this puzzle.

1168

She needed a key,

1192

I loved her more than Sheba.

Yes.

It became my greatest desire

The air is thick here.

1306
01:22:40,186 --> 01:22:44,278
Full of insistent voices
and rushing faces.

1307
01:22:44,756 --> 01:22:46,474
[A lit he a] Oh?

1308
01:22:46,497 --> 01:22:49,259
Like Tiny Einstein?

1309
01:22:49,283 --> 01:22:51,435
Television, and phone towers,
and such?

1310
01:22:51,458 --> 01:22:53,176
Yes.

1311
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:56,962
Yes. All your
ingenious devices

1312
01:22:56,987 --> 01:22:58,747
all murmuring at once.

1313
01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:00,618
Bend your head.

1314
01:23:00,641 --> 01:23:03,317
[high-pitched pinging]

1315
01:23:03,341 --> 01:23:05,448
[people clamoring
and traffic bustling]

1316
01:23:05,472 --> 01:23:07,320
- [gasps]
- [noises stop]

1317
01:23:07,345 --> 01:23:09,409
You hear all that?

1318
01:23:09,434 --> 01:23:11,106
[noises continue]

1319
01:23:11,131 --> 01:23:12,238
- [gasps]
- [noises stop]

1320
01:23:12,262 --> 01:23:15,242
I also see it and feel it.

1321
01:23:15,265 --> 01:23:18,244
I am a transmitter. [Chuckles]

1322
01:23:18,269 --> 01:23:20,010
Isn't it all too much?

1323
01:23:21,185 --> 01:23:22,466
I am a djinn.

1324
01:23:22,489 --> 01:23:23,664
I can adapt.

1325
01:23:25,579 --> 01:23:27,341
I'll soon get used to it.

1326
01:23:27,364 --> 01:23:29,212
[woman] She's back.

1327
01:23:29,235 --> 01:23:30,560
I believe she's back.

1328
01:23:30,585 --> 01:23:32,520
Is she with someone?

1329
01:23:32,543 --> 01:23:34,564
[woman] No, I think she's
talking to herself again.

1330
01:23:34,588 --> 01:23:36,305
[A lit he a] Hello, Clementine.

1331
01:23:36,329 --> 01:23:38,655
Fanny. Are you well?

1332
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,484
[Clementine]
Did you have any trouble?

1333
01:23:40,507 --> 01:23:42,659
Trouble? What kind of trouble?

1334
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:44,488
With your foreign friends.

1335
01:23:44,511 --> 01:23:46,403
Because we often ask ourselves,

1336
01:23:46,426 --> 01:23:49,101
"Why would Dr. Binnie waste
her time and intelligence"

1337
01:23:49,126 --> 01:23:51,800
"studying the ways of others
instead of upholding our own?"

1338
01:23:51,823 --> 01:23:54,323
Embarrassed by
our British culture, are we?

1339
01:23:54,347 --> 01:23:55,804
No. No.

1340
01:23:55,828 --> 01:23:58,198
I am rather more likely
to be embarrassed by anybody

1341
01:23:58,221 --> 01:24:00,547
reflexly frightened
of anybody different.

1342
01:24:00,572 --> 01:24:01,679
What exactly are you saying?

1343
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:03,463
She's calling us bigots.

1344
01:24:03,488 --> 01:24:04,507
Your word, not mine.

1345
01:24:04,532 --> 01:24:05,640
[Clementine] You misunderstand.

1346
01:24:05,663 --> 01:24:07,162
- Oh?
- It's not how they look, dear.

1347
01:24:07,186 --> 01:24:08,685
It's how they live.
What they believe.

1348
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,426
- What they eat.
- What are you on about?

1349
01:24:10,451 --> 01:24:12,255
Everywhere one goes, ethnics.

1350
01:24:12,279 --> 01:24:15,257
We are being overwhelmed,
and we're inviting our doom.

1351
01:24:15,282 --> 01:24:16,606
[Fanny] It's not natural.

1352
01:24:16,631 --> 01:24:18,739
Birds belong in the air.
Fish belong in the sea.

1353
01:24:18,764 --> 01:24:21,046
And that is how the good Lord
meant us to be.

1354
01:24:21,070 --> 01:24:23,091
You're just spouting rubbish
from start to finish.

1355
01:24:23,115 --> 01:24:24,614
It's science.
It's a scientific fact.

1356
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:25,877
- It's a false analogy.
- [voices echoing]

1357
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:28,140
I mean, animals do have
a natural habitat.

1358
01:24:28,164 --> 01:24:30,359
It's true,
but human beings are capable

1359
01:24:30,384 --> 01:24:32,493
of living in any environment
they bloody well choose.

1360
01:24:32,516 --> 01:24:33,711
- That's not a fact.
- [airplane engine humming]

1361
01:24:33,734 --> 01:24:35,364
- What are you saying?
- It's an opinion.

1362
01:24:35,389 --> 01:24:36,583
And you're wrong.

1363
01:24:36,608 --> 01:24:38,064
I'm not putting up
with any more of this.

1364
01:24:38,087 --> 01:24:40,283
Come away, Clem.
Let the crazy lady be.

1365
01:24:40,306 --> 01:24:42,198
We're never gonna get
any sense out of her.

1366
01:24:42,221 --> 01:24:44,502
[A lit he a] You know, I've never
said this to you before.

1367
01:24:45,137 --> 01:24:47,551
But you're both pitiful.

1368
01:24:47,574 --> 01:24:48,770
Shut your cake hole! [Echoing]

1369
01:24:48,793 --> 01:24:51,362
Pea-brained and pitiful.

1370
01:24:51,884 --> 01:24:54,253
You, fuck face!

1371
01:24:54,278 --> 01:24:58,282
Stop your ivy growing
on our side of the wall!

1372
01:24:59,369 --> 01:25:01,521
Why do I let them get to me?

1373
01:25:01,546 --> 01:25:03,610
I should feel sorry for them.

1374
01:25:03,635 --> 01:25:06,831
But this is my home.
It's my sanctuary.

1375
01:25:06,854 --> 01:25:08,442
[inhaler hisses]

1376
01:25:08,466 --> 01:25:10,878
[Clementine and Fanny's
voices echoing]

1377
01:25:10,903 --> 01:25:13,122
- I could wish them... [grunts]
- [static buzzes]

1378
01:25:14,167 --> 01:25:16,363
That's not a wish, by the way.

1379
01:25:16,386 --> 01:25:17,755
- I know.
- [exhales heavily]

1380
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:20,235
[Clementine and Fanny's voices
continue echoing]

1381
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:22,957
[people chattering indistinctly
from transmissions]

1382
01:25:26,744 --> 01:25:29,114
[A lit he a breathing heavily]

1383
01:25:29,139 --> 01:25:31,184
[transmissions fading]

1384
01:25:35,493 --> 01:25:38,278
[sentimental string
music playing]

1385
01:26:29,328 --> 01:26:32,244
[sentimental string
music continues]

1386
01:27:21,425 --> 01:27:22,686
[A lit he a whispers] My djinn.

1387
01:27:23,730 --> 01:27:24,926
[The Djinn] How was your day?

1388
01:27:24,949 --> 01:27:27,319
[A lit he a] Every listening ear
was yours.

1389
01:27:27,344 --> 01:27:29,930
Every voice, every scent,
and touch.

1390
01:27:29,954 --> 01:27:31,695
You were everywhere.

1391
01:27:36,917 --> 01:27:38,615
Back in a minute.

1392
01:27:57,677 --> 01:27:59,787
[Fanny] Whoever could that be
at this hour?

1393
01:27:59,810 --> 01:28:00,930
[Clementine]
It could be her.

1394
01:28:04,381 --> 01:28:07,296
Clem. Fanny.

1395
01:28:09,341 --> 01:28:11,823
Chickpeas, cloves, pistachio.

1396
01:28:13,650 --> 01:28:15,347
They melt in your mouth.

1397
01:28:33,365 --> 01:28:34,845
This is my friend.

1398
01:28:35,976 --> 01:28:37,891
He'll be staying for a while.

1399
01:28:38,805 --> 01:28:39,850
Hello.

1400
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:44,681
- Hello.
- Hello.

1401
01:28:48,947 --> 01:28:50,707
[A lit he a] My Djinn told me,

1402
01:28:50,730 --> 01:28:53,667
when they come together
in the Realm of Djinn,

1403
01:28:53,690 --> 01:28:55,475
they tell each other stories.

1404
01:28:56,649 --> 01:28:58,759
Stories are like breath to them.

1405
01:28:58,783 --> 01:28:59,871
They make meaning.

1406
01:29:01,828 --> 01:29:03,067
"Yes," I said.

1407
01:29:03,091 --> 01:29:04,876
"That's just how
it is with us."

1408
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:07,636
Each story we tell is a fragment

1409
01:29:07,661 --> 01:29:10,097
in an endless
shape-shifting mosaic.

1410
01:29:11,664 --> 01:29:15,800
And this small pebble,
like all stories, must end.

1411
01:29:17,757 --> 01:29:20,935
If it's about wishing,
it's a cautionary tale.

1412
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:25,002
So, how will it go wrong?

1413
01:29:25,025 --> 01:29:27,551
Perhaps, it already has.

1414
01:29:30,858 --> 01:29:33,359
Even though Truth
stood before them naked,

1415
01:29:33,382 --> 01:29:35,011
they turned their backs.

1416
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:39,494
So, Truth moved to the side
and waited in the shadows.

1417
01:29:39,519 --> 01:29:41,149
In the days that followed,

1418
01:29:41,172 --> 01:29:44,673
the Djinn would accompany
the narratologist to her work.

1419
01:29:44,698 --> 01:29:46,283
And when he wasn't with her,

1420
01:29:46,307 --> 01:29:49,505
he would go in eager
exploration of the world.

1421
01:29:49,529 --> 01:29:52,465
[machine beeping]

1422
01:29:52,488 --> 01:29:55,404
[The Djinn] Today I had
such a marvelous day.

1423
01:29:56,710 --> 01:29:59,689
I saw many things.

1424
01:29:59,712 --> 01:30:03,867
I watched a human look into
the living brain of another

1425
01:30:03,890 --> 01:30:06,502
and arrest a fatal bleeding.

1426
01:30:10,984 --> 01:30:12,770
I visited the Collider.

1427
01:30:14,074 --> 01:30:18,515
A vast gizmo which probed
the essence of matter.

1428
01:30:21,648 --> 01:30:24,887
And then I saw a dish,
a great dish

1429
01:30:24,912 --> 01:30:28,612
that listens to the whispers
of stars long dead.

1430
01:30:30,743 --> 01:30:32,721
Humankind is...

1431
01:30:32,746 --> 01:30:34,661
is a wonder, A lit he a.

1432
01:30:35,574 --> 01:30:37,988
I'm happy you think so.

1433
01:30:38,011 --> 01:30:41,078
All of this since I was
trapped in Zefir's bottle.

1434
01:30:41,101 --> 01:30:45,865
All these astonishments,
in less than 200 years.

1435
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:47,868
Yes, but, I mean,

1436
01:30:47,891 --> 01:30:52,176
that's just engineering
and technology.

1437
01:30:52,199 --> 01:30:54,787
Despite all the whiz-bang,

1438
01:30:54,811 --> 01:30:56,944
we remain bewildered.

1439
01:30:59,859 --> 01:31:01,819
When we can't contain the chaos,

1440
01:31:03,603 --> 01:31:06,189
we are filled
with dread and panic,

1441
01:31:06,213 --> 01:31:08,497
and we turn on each other.

1442
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:11,020
But of course, you are human.

1443
01:31:11,045 --> 01:31:13,177
That is your nature.

1444
01:31:15,528 --> 01:31:18,966
Yeah. So, the story
never changes.

1445
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:22,555
Hate prevails.

1446
01:31:22,578 --> 01:31:27,192
It metastasizes
and outlives love.

1447
01:31:28,975 --> 01:31:31,606
I just want to talk about love.

1448
01:31:31,631 --> 01:31:35,654
Such a mess of
contradictions, all of you.

1449
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:36,786
Thank you very much.

1450
01:31:36,810 --> 01:31:40,094
Humankind, what a conundrum.

1451
01:31:40,118 --> 01:31:42,836
You fumble around in the dark,

1452
01:31:42,859 --> 01:31:45,969
and yet, you herd your
intelligence to great effect.

1453
01:31:45,993 --> 01:31:47,622
It is quite a story.

1454
01:31:47,646 --> 01:31:48,885
[chuckles softly]

1455
01:31:48,908 --> 01:31:51,757
Cannot wait to see
where it goes.

1456
01:31:51,782 --> 01:31:53,697
Or how it might end.

1457
01:31:54,045 --> 01:31:55,761
That too.

1458
01:31:55,786 --> 01:31:59,721
A mortal will never know,
but a djinn might.

1459
01:31:59,746 --> 01:32:02,226
A djinn has all the time
in the world.

1460
01:32:04,315 --> 01:32:06,511
Aren't you the lucky one?

1461
01:32:06,536 --> 01:32:07,885
Maybe.

1462
01:32:08,886 --> 01:32:12,126
But you creatures
of dust have...

1463
01:32:12,149 --> 01:32:13,649
have managed to eclipse

1464
01:32:13,672 --> 01:32:17,000
the power and purpose
of djinn and angel.

1465
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:19,220
You have no use for us.

1466
01:32:19,243 --> 01:32:20,613
Perhaps, we will wither and...

1467
01:32:20,636 --> 01:32:22,136
- And fade away?
- Yes.

1468
01:32:22,159 --> 01:32:24,573
Yeah. Well, that used
to be the subject

1469
01:32:24,596 --> 01:32:26,662
of all my lectures and papers.

1470
01:32:26,685 --> 01:32:27,992
I know.

1471
01:32:30,603 --> 01:32:32,344
And yet, here you are.

1472
01:32:34,041 --> 01:32:36,130
My impossible.

1473
01:32:38,045 --> 01:32:39,132
Yes.

1476
01:32:51,581 --> 01:32:52,756
Hello?

1477
01:32:58,195 --> 01:32:59,805
I'm home!

1478
01:33:09,773 --> 01:33:11,078
Hello?

1479
01:33:30,750 --> 01:33:31,837
[switch clicks]

1480
01:33:37,104 --> 01:33:38,671
Djinn?

1481
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:43,912
My love?

1482
01:33:43,936 --> 01:33:45,155
[A lit he a gasps]

1483
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:48,985
Djinn.

[switch clicks]

1485
01:33:53,207 --> 01:33:54,381
What's this?

1486
01:33:56,993 --> 01:33:58,971
Can you hear me?

1487
01:33:58,996 --> 01:34:01,148
Djinn, speak to me.

1488
01:34:01,171 --> 01:34:02,738
Try to speak to me.

1489
01:34:04,697 --> 01:34:06,872
I wish you to speak to me.

1490

1497
01:34:26,893 --> 01:34:28,914
[in distorted high voice]
I was sleeping.

1498
01:34:28,939 --> 01:34:31,158
[grunts] Sleeping.

1499
01:34:32,899 --> 01:34:35,007
Djinn don't sleep.

1500
01:34:35,032 --> 01:34:36,313
[The Djinn] Let's go for a walk.

1501
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:37,792
A long, bracing walk.

1502
01:34:37,817 --> 01:34:39,359
I have prepared
something for us.

1503
01:34:39,384 --> 01:34:40,970
[in normal voice]
I have it all planned.

1504
01:34:40,993 --> 01:34:43,145
[breathlessly]
A wonderous night for us.

1505
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:45,322
It will be amazing.

1506
01:34:45,345 --> 01:34:48,150
- The best time of our lives.
- Stop!

1507
01:34:48,175 --> 01:34:52,286
These electromagnetic fields,
I can push them from my head.

1508
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:53,877
I can push them away.

1509
01:34:54,965 --> 01:34:56,158
We'll go for a picnic.

1510

[speaking Djinnbish]

1514
01:35:05,845 --> 01:35:09,128
A lit he a, there is a place
for me here.

1515
01:35:09,153 --> 01:35:10,390
These forces,

1516
01:35:10,414 --> 01:35:12,087
they will never go away,
not from this world.

1517
01:35:12,112 --> 01:35:14,307
I will overcome them.
I can do that for you.

1518
01:35:14,332 --> 01:35:16,484
You are my A lit he a,
and I love you.

1519
01:35:16,507 --> 01:35:18,268
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you for trying.

1520
01:35:18,292 --> 01:35:19,572
You don't think that I love you?

1521
01:35:20,511 --> 01:35:22,707
Love is a gift.

1522
01:35:22,731 --> 01:35:25,100
It's a gift of oneself
given freely.

1523
01:35:25,125 --> 01:35:27,345
It's not something
one can ever ask for.

1524
01:35:28,868 --> 01:35:30,063
I tricked us both.

1525
01:35:30,087 --> 01:35:31,760
The moment I spoke that wish,

1526
01:35:31,783 --> 01:35:34,850
I took away
your power to grant it.

1527
01:35:34,873 --> 01:35:39,114
I, more than anybody,
I should've known that.

1528
01:35:39,139 --> 01:35:41,291
I'm not going
to screw this up again.

1529
01:35:41,314 --> 01:35:45,469
My Djinn, if this world
is not for you,

1530
01:35:45,493 --> 01:35:48,365
I wish that you return
to where you belong.

1531
01:35:49,193 --> 01:35:51,282
Wherever that may be.

[man 1] Did you see that?

1555
01:40:10,149 --> 01:40:12,735
[A lit he a] He would visit
from time to time,

1556
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:16,217
and they would grasp
each vivid moment.

Despite the pain
of the raucous skies,

he always stayed
longer than he should,

long after
she begged him to leave.

1560

He promised to return
in her lifetime,

1561
01:40:28,515 --> 01:40:31,518
and for her,
that was more than enough.
