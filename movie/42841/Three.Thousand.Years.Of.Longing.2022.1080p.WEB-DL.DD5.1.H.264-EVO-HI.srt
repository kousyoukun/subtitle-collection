6
01:01:47,063 --> 01:01:49,698
<i>So, once upon a time,</i>

7
01:01:49,731 --> 01:01:53,635
<i>when humans hurtled
across the sky on metal wings,</i>

<i>when they wore webbed feet</i>

9

<i>and walked
on the bottom of the sea,</i>

10

<i>when they held
in their hands glass tiles</i>

11

love songs from the air...</i>

<i>Alone by choice.</i>

15
01:02:11,653 --> 01:02:14,522
<i>Happy because
she was independent,</i>

16
01:02:14,556 --> 01:02:17,792
<i>living off the exercise
of her scholarly mind.</i>

17
01:02:19,961 --> 01:02:21,529
<i>Her business was story.</i>

18
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:24,399
<i>She was a narratologist</i>

19
01:02:24,432 --> 01:02:26,168
<i>who sought to find the truths</i>

20

<i>To this end,

22

What are you doing?
Can you let go, please?

29
01:02:57,032 --> 01:02:59,235
The mysteries of Istanbul.

Alithea!

01:03:10,045 --> 01:03:11,479
Welcome!

34
01:03:11,513 --> 01:03:13,182
- Welcome at last! Aw.
- Gunhan!

35
01:03:13,215 --> 01:03:15,316
- [both laugh]
- My dear friend.

36
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:16,961
- [Alithea] Oh, how wonderful!
- [Gunhan] I'm sorry.

37
01:03:16,985 --> 01:03:18,486
- This is Amina.
- Amina.

38
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:20,421
From the British Council.

39
01:03:21,856 --> 01:03:24,626
That fellow at the airport
manhandling my luggage,

40
01:03:24,659 --> 01:03:25,860
did you see him?

41
01:03:25,894 --> 01:03:27,029
What fellow?

42
01:03:28,329 --> 01:03:30,799
He scuttled off
when you arrived.

43
01:03:31,633 --> 01:03:36,038
Small, sheepskin jacket,
pink collar.

44
01:03:38,673 --> 01:03:39,774
Interesting.

45
01:03:40,809 --> 01:03:42,977
He was hot to touch.

46
01:03:44,146 --> 01:03:45,413
Musky.

47
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:47,448
Perhaps he was a djinn.

48
01:03:47,482 --> 01:03:50,119
An illegal taxi driver,
more likely.

49
01:03:50,152 --> 01:03:52,087
Wearing too much cologne.

50
01:03:52,121 --> 01:03:53,755
So, Professor,

51
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:56,091
you saying you believe in djinn?

52
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:59,195
I believe there are those
who need to believe in them.

53
01:03:59,228 --> 01:04:00,361
Including me?

54
01:04:00,395 --> 01:04:01,896
Djinn, ghosts,

55
01:04:02,597 --> 01:04:04,699
aliens, whatever helps.

56
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:09,004
[Gunhan laughs]

57
01:04:10,939 --> 01:04:13,842
The hotel's arranged
a lovely surprise for you.

58
01:04:19,181 --> 01:04:21,016
It's the Agatha Christie room.

59
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:21,950
In this room,

60
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:24,919
she wrote
<i>Murder on the Orient Express.</i>

61
01:04:29,624 --> 01:04:30,859
[sighs]

62
01:04:30,892 --> 01:04:32,894
[audience laughing]

63
01:04:32,927 --> 01:04:34,796
[Gunhan chuckles]

64
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:37,565
[Gunhan] So,
how would you explain

65
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:40,135
the power of a thunderstorm

66
01:04:40,169 --> 01:04:41,337
if you don't have the means

67
01:04:41,369 --> 01:04:43,972
to measure and model
meteorological data?

68
01:04:45,607 --> 01:04:47,742
How can you explain the seasons?

69
01:04:47,775 --> 01:04:50,545
Autumn through winter
to spring and summer,

70
01:04:50,578 --> 01:04:52,714
if you don't know that the Earth

71
01:04:52,747 --> 01:04:55,516
orbits the Sun
while tilted on an axis?

72
01:04:56,584 --> 01:04:58,620
Everything was mystery.

73
01:04:58,653 --> 01:05:03,691
The seasons, tsunamis,
microbial disease...

74
01:05:03,725 --> 01:05:07,795
What else could we do
but resort to stories?

75
01:05:07,829 --> 01:05:11,033
As Dr. Binnie has
encouraged us to understand,

76
01:05:11,066 --> 01:05:12,934
stories were once the only way

77
01:05:12,967 --> 01:05:15,503
to make our bewildering
existence coherent.

78
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:17,273
That's exactly right.

79
01:05:17,306 --> 01:05:20,175
We gave name
to the unknown forces

80
01:05:20,209 --> 01:05:23,212
behind all wonder
and catastrophe,

81
01:05:23,245 --> 01:05:25,580
by telling each other...

82
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:31,853
By telling each other stories.

83
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:33,655
- [Gunhan] let me show you.
- [static buzzes]

84
01:05:33,688 --> 01:05:38,227
We told tales of specific,
powerful, relatable gods

85
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:41,796
ever present in all cultures,
in all mythologies,

86
01:05:41,829 --> 01:05:45,034
from the Greeks,
to the Romans, to the Norse,

87
01:05:45,067 --> 01:05:46,701
and so on, and so on.

88
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:50,239
The familiar descendant
of Zeus, Poseidon, Athena,

89
01:05:50,272 --> 01:05:52,640
Thor, the whole gang,

90
01:05:52,674 --> 01:05:55,277
find expression even today.

91
01:05:55,311 --> 01:05:56,778
[low electrical humming]

92
01:05:56,811 --> 01:05:59,747
These are their vestiges.

93
01:06:01,417 --> 01:06:04,919
The question remains,
what is their purpose?

94
01:06:07,356 --> 01:06:10,359
[electrical humming continues]

95
01:06:10,392 --> 01:06:12,460
What do we require of them now?

96
01:06:14,529 --> 01:06:17,665
There is mythos,
and there is science.

97
01:06:17,699 --> 01:06:19,600
[electrical humming stops]

98
01:06:19,634 --> 01:06:22,271
[Alithea softly] Oh. Sorry.

99
01:06:22,304 --> 01:06:26,574
Mythology is what
we knew back then.

100
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:29,711
Science is what we know so far.

101
01:06:29,744 --> 01:06:32,047
[low electrical humming resumes]

102
01:06:34,383 --> 01:06:36,718
Sooner or later,

103
01:06:36,751 --> 01:06:39,554
our creation stories
are replaced

104
01:06:39,587 --> 01:06:41,622
by the narratives of science.

105
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:45,060
Painstaking science.

106
01:06:45,094 --> 01:06:46,995
And all gods and monsters

107
01:06:47,895 --> 01:06:50,165
outlive their original purpose

108
01:06:51,266 --> 01:06:53,534
and are reduced to metaphor.

109
01:06:53,568 --> 01:06:55,837
Rubbish! [Roars]

110
01:06:58,573 --> 01:07:00,242
[Gunhan muffled] Alithea!

111
01:07:00,275 --> 01:07:02,011
[woman speaking indistinctly]

112
01:07:04,346 --> 01:07:05,613
[Gunhan] Alithea.

113
01:07:06,514 --> 01:07:07,682
[woman] What happened?

114
01:07:07,715 --> 01:07:09,284
[Gunhan] I don't know.
She just fell.

115
01:07:09,318 --> 01:07:11,220
- She just fell.
- [Amina grunts]

116
01:07:11,253 --> 01:07:13,222
[Amina] Gosh. [Exclaiming]

117
01:07:20,162 --> 01:07:21,596
[Gunhan] Are you okay?

118
01:07:22,097 --> 01:07:24,266
[audience clapping]

119
01:07:29,238 --> 01:07:30,772
[rattling]

120
01:07:32,041 --> 01:07:33,475
[Gunhan] Shouldn't
you see a doctor?

121
01:07:33,509 --> 01:07:34,986
[Alithea] Why?
When I feel so well?

122
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:37,246
[Gunhan] Forgive me, Alithea.
Are you sure?

123
01:07:37,279 --> 01:07:39,680
[Alithea] Apart from
the usual aches and pains,

124
01:07:39,714 --> 01:07:41,383
there is nothing untoward.

125
01:07:41,417 --> 01:07:43,085
There's no reason
to make a fuss.

126
01:07:43,118 --> 01:07:45,120
[Gunhan] So, what happened
back there?

127
01:07:49,058 --> 01:07:53,095
Lately, my imagination's
been getting the better of me.

128
01:07:53,694 --> 01:07:55,663
Ambushing me.

129
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:57,032
I think it's a warning.

130
01:07:57,066 --> 01:07:58,267
About what?

131
01:07:59,567 --> 01:08:01,569
Not to be complacent.

132
01:08:01,602 --> 01:08:03,905
To keep on my toes.

133
01:08:03,938 --> 01:08:06,574
It manifests rudely
from time to time.

134
01:08:06,607 --> 01:08:09,111
I try not to fight it off.

135
01:08:09,144 --> 01:08:13,148
It takes charge for a moment,
and then it steps back.

136
01:08:13,182 --> 01:08:14,516
What steps back?

137
01:08:14,550 --> 01:08:17,752
Oh, Gunhan, it's
irrational. Pay it no mind.

138
01:08:20,055 --> 01:08:22,458
[Gunhan] You are behaving like
a child. Do you know that?

139
01:08:22,491 --> 01:08:24,135
[Alithea] You know,
I am actually a child.

140
01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:25,494
[Gunhan laughs]

141
01:08:25,527 --> 01:08:28,197
[people chattering indistinctly]

142
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:31,266
[Alithea] <i>If there is fate,</i>
<i>can we escape it?</i>

143
01:08:32,034 --> 01:08:33,302
<i>Who can say?</i>

144
01:08:33,835 --> 01:08:35,970
<i>But I tell you this,</i>

145
01:08:36,004 --> 01:08:38,173
<i>in the Grand Bazaar of Istanbul,</i>

146
01:08:38,207 --> 01:08:43,078
<i>there are 62 streets
and 4,000 shops.</i>

147
01:08:43,112 --> 01:08:46,381
<i>And in one of those shops,
there are three rooms.</i>

148
01:08:47,516 --> 01:08:49,151
<i>In the smallest of those rooms,</i>

149
01:08:49,184 --> 01:08:51,986
<i>there was a pile
of things unsorted,</i>

150
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:53,654
<i>old and new.</i>

151
01:08:54,523 --> 01:08:56,657
<i>From the bottom of that pile,</i>

152
01:08:57,493 --> 01:08:59,228
<i>I chose a memento.</i>

153
01:09:05,167 --> 01:09:06,767
Do you know what this is?

154
01:09:06,801 --> 01:09:09,670
I'm not sure,
but it could be Cesm-i Bulbul,

155
01:09:09,704 --> 01:09:11,140
a "Nightingale's Eye."

156
01:09:11,173 --> 01:09:14,343
Around 1845, there were
these glassmakers in Incirkoy.

157
01:09:14,376 --> 01:09:17,346
They were famous for this
spiral blue-white pattern.

158
01:09:17,379 --> 01:09:19,381
Oh, please.
It's a gift from me.

159
01:09:19,414 --> 01:09:21,216
Choose something less forlorn.

160
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:28,257
And, uh, if this
is Cesm-i Bulbul,

161
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:30,791
uh, is there a way
of authenticating it?

162
01:09:30,825 --> 01:09:32,528
Well, they say
that if it is genuine,

163

328
01:20:03,324 --> 01:20:06,262
How come you found your way
into my bottle?

329
01:20:07,395 --> 01:20:08,897
Ah, it's quite a story.

330
01:20:09,697 --> 01:20:11,733
That was my third incarceration.

331
01:20:11,766 --> 01:20:13,835
You've been trapped
in a bottle three times?

332
01:20:13,868 --> 01:20:16,005
I may be a djinn,
but I'm also a fool

333
01:20:16,038 --> 01:20:18,807
with too great a fondness
for the conversation of women.

334
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:21,177
I need to be more careful
in the future.

335
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:22,744
How were you caught
in the first place?

336
01:20:23,678 --> 01:20:25,147
By desire.

337
01:20:25,181 --> 01:20:26,948
How else?

338
01:20:29,918 --> 01:20:31,519
Who was she?

339
01:20:31,553 --> 01:20:32,954
Sheba.

340
01:20:32,987 --> 01:20:34,156
The Queen of Sheba?

341
01:20:34,190 --> 01:20:35,890
She was my kin.

342
01:20:35,924 --> 01:20:37,026
She was a djinn?

343
01:20:37,059 --> 01:20:38,359
Her mother was a djinn.

344
01:20:38,393 --> 01:20:39,460
Is that possible?

345
01:20:39,494 --> 01:20:40,628
There are laws that allow

346
01:20:40,662 --> 01:20:42,164
the union of djinn and mortals,

347
01:20:42,198 --> 01:20:44,099
but they cannot produce
an immortal scion

348
01:20:44,133 --> 01:20:45,243
the way a donkey and a horse

349
01:20:45,267 --> 01:20:47,368
can only produce
a seedless mule.

350
01:20:49,038 --> 01:20:51,940
So, what did she look like?

351
01:20:51,973 --> 01:20:56,178
Other than a thick glade
of black hair on her legs,

352
01:20:56,212 --> 01:20:57,588
she looked like
any other human being,

353
01:20:57,612 --> 01:20:59,881
except, of course,
she was Sheba.

354
01:20:59,914 --> 01:21:02,517
By all accounts,
she was very beautiful.

355
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:05,620
She was not beautiful.
She was beauty itself.

356
01:21:09,191 --> 01:21:11,793
I was in every way free.

357
01:21:11,826 --> 01:21:14,963
I would come in and out
of her sleeping chamber.

358
01:21:16,165 --> 01:21:18,633
[whispers] Sheba...

359
01:21:20,236 --> 01:21:21,936

360
01:21:21,970 --> 01:21:24,873

of her female slaves</i>

361
01:21:24,906 --> 01:21:28,010
<i>the touches that made
her shiver with bliss.</i>

362
01:21:29,211 --> 01:21:31,679
<i>Never have I wanted
a creature so.</i>

363
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:33,815
And she desired you in return?

364
01:21:33,848 --> 01:21:37,219
I was her plaything.
Her confidante.

365
01:21:37,253 --> 01:21:39,487
I might have become more,
but for Solomon.

366
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,889
King Solomon?

367
01:21:40,922 --> 01:21:42,690
Blessed be his memory.

368
01:21:42,724 --> 01:21:45,160
He came from across
the deserts to woo her.

369
01:21:45,194 --> 01:21:46,295
Didn't she go to him?

370
01:21:46,328 --> 01:21:47,629
No. Never.

371
01:21:47,662 --> 01:21:49,464
But it's in all the holy books.

372
01:21:49,497 --> 01:21:51,133
All the stories
and the paintings.

373
01:21:51,166 --> 01:21:52,934
And Handel wrote music about it.

374
01:21:52,967 --> 01:21:54,336
Madam, I was there.

375
01:21:54,370 --> 01:21:56,205
Solomon came to her.

376

I did all that I could
to dissuade her.

388
01:24:00,462 --> 01:24:01,562
But when she used

389

the scented wax
of the Jabassa Bee

390
01:24:03,465 --> 01:24:05,167
to remove the hair
from her legs,

<i>I knew that I was lost.</i>

392
01:24:06,734 --> 01:24:09,038

<i>that her body
was rich and lovely,</i>

394

<i>and more durable.</i>

396
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:18,579
<i>And she agreed
with all that I said,</i>

397

<i>and dropped a hot tear.</i>

She began to set him tasks,
which seemed impossible,

of red silk

in the palace
of a thousand rooms,

401

what women most desire.

Not for him.

405
01:24:37,965 --> 01:24:39,576

to the beasts of the earth,

made of subtle fire.

I pray to any god I know,

440

and then to any god
I may not know.

441
01:27:11,453 --> 01:27:14,122

- A mother, perhaps?

no siblings, no parents.

[The Djinn] Ah.

01:28:24,426 --> 01:28:26,827
And what was the complexion
of this husband?

01:28:27,396 --> 01:28:28,630
His complexion?

475
01:28:28,664 --> 01:28:31,832
In the beginning,
it was glowing.

And in the ending?

477
01:28:33,669 --> 01:28:35,170
It's not much of a story.

478
01:28:35,203 --> 01:28:38,273
But it is a story.
It is your story,

479

and it is always wise

480
01:28:39,775 --> 01:28:41,677
to understand those
who have a hold on you.

1283
02:20:02,890 --> 02:20:04,459
What is in your pockets?

1284
02:20:05,193 --> 02:20:06,194
Oh.

1285
02:20:07,095 --> 02:20:10,399
Uh, it's an empty bottle
and a top.

1286
02:20:11,500 --> 02:20:12,868
Please put it through X-ray.

1287
02:20:12,933 --> 02:20:13,934
It is very delicate,

1288
02:20:13,968 --> 02:20:15,246
and I don't want it
to get damaged.

1289
02:20:15,270 --> 02:20:17,239
It will not be damaged.
Please put through X-ray.

1290
02:20:17,272 --> 02:20:18,616
I would prefer that
it didn't go in the...

1291
02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:19,940
Passport. Boarding pass.

1292
02:20:21,309 --> 02:20:22,310
Thank you.

1293
02:20:32,754 --> 02:20:33,822
It's quite fragile.

1294
02:20:33,855 --> 02:20:35,123
[supervisor] Madam.

1295
02:20:39,428 --> 02:20:41,163

Oh.

No! No X-ray! Please!

[Alithea] Oh?

1308
02:23:02,671 --> 02:23:05,240
Like Tiny Einstein?

1309
02:23:05,273 --> 02:23:07,609
Television, and phone towers,
and such?

1310

Yes.

1311
02:23:09,177 --> 02:23:12,914
Yes. All your
ingenious devices

1312

1313

I am a transmitter. [Chuckles]

1322
02:23:34,235 --> 02:23:36,137
Isn't it all too much?

1323
02:23:37,172 --> 02:23:38,607
I am a djinn.

1324
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:39,741
I can adapt.

1325
02:23:41,743 --> 02:23:43,311
I'll soon get used to it.

1326
02:23:43,345 --> 02:23:45,180
[woman] She's back.

1327
02:23:45,213 --> 02:23:46,715
I believe she's back.

1328
02:23:46,748 --> 02:23:48,483
Is she with someone?

1329
02:23:48,516 --> 02:23:50,719
[woman] No, I think she's
talking to herself again.

1330
02:23:50,752 --> 02:23:52,287
[Alithea] Hello, Clementine.

1331
02:23:52,320 --> 02:23:54,589
Fanny. Are you well?

1332
02:23:54,623 --> 02:23:56,424
[Clementine]
Did you have any trouble?

1333
02:23:56,458 --> 02:23:58,827
Trouble? What kind of trouble?

1334
02:23:58,860 --> 02:24:00,462
With your foreign friends.

1335
02:24:00,495 --> 02:24:02,364
Because we often ask ourselves,

1336
02:24:02,397 --> 02:24:04,866
"Why would Dr. Binnie waste
her time and intelligence"

1337
02:24:04,899 --> 02:24:07,769
"studying the ways of others
instead of upholding our own?"

1338
02:24:07,802 --> 02:24:10,472
Embarrassed by
our British culture, are we?

1339
02:24:10,505 --> 02:24:11,606
No. No.

1340
02:24:11,640 --> 02:24:14,175
I am rather more likely
to be embarrassed by anybody

1341
02:24:14,209 --> 02:24:16,711
reflexly frightened
of anybody different.

1342
02:24:16,745 --> 02:24:17,855
What exactly are you saying?

1343
02:24:17,879 --> 02:24:19,614
She's calling us bigots.

1344
02:24:19,648 --> 02:24:20,482
Your word, not mine.

1345
02:24:20,515 --> 02:24:21,592
[Clementine] You misunderstand.

1346
02:24:21,616 --> 02:24:23,151
- Oh?
- It's not how they look, dear.

1347
02:24:23,184 --> 02:24:24,629
It's how they live.
What they believe.

1348
02:24:24,653 --> 02:24:26,388
- What they eat.
- What are you on about?

1349
02:24:26,421 --> 02:24:28,223
Everywhere one goes, ethnics.

1350
02:24:28,256 --> 02:24:31,226
We are being overwhelmed,
and we're inviting our doom.

1351
02:24:31,259 --> 02:24:32,460
[Fanny] It's not natural.

1352
02:24:32,494 --> 02:24:34,696
Birds belong in the air.
Fish belong in the sea.

1353
02:24:34,729 --> 02:24:36,798
And that is how the good Lord
meant us to be.

1354
02:24:36,831 --> 02:24:39,035
You're just spouting rubbish
from start to finish.

1355
02:24:39,068 --> 02:24:40,602
It's science.
It's a scientific fact.

1356
02:24:40,635 --> 02:24:41,746
- It's a false analogy.
- [voices echoing]

1357
02:24:41,770 --> 02:24:44,106
I mean, animals do have
a natural habitat.

1358
02:24:44,140 --> 02:24:46,307
It's true,
but human beings are capable

1359
02:24:46,341 --> 02:24:48,443
of living in any environment
they bloody well choose.

1360
02:24:48,476 --> 02:24:49,687
- That's not a fact.
- [airplane engine humming]

1361
02:24:49,711 --> 02:24:51,312
- What are you saying?
- It's an opinion.

1362
02:24:51,346 --> 02:24:52,447
And you're wrong.

1363
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:54,026
I'm not putting up
with any more of this.

1364
02:24:54,050 --> 02:24:56,251
Come away, Clem.
Let the crazy lady be.

1365
02:24:56,284 --> 02:24:57,962
We're never gonna get
any sense out of her.

1366
02:24:57,986 --> 02:25:00,588
[Alithea] You know, I've never
said this to you before.

1367
02:25:01,123 --> 02:25:03,525
But you're both pitiful.

1368
02:25:03,558 --> 02:25:04,926
Shut your cake hole! [Echoing]

1369
02:25:04,959 --> 02:25:07,462
Pea-brained and pitiful.

1370
02:25:08,030 --> 02:25:10,231
You, fuck face!

1371
02:25:10,265 --> 02:25:14,369
Stop your ivy growing
on our side of the wall!

1372
02:25:15,336 --> 02:25:17,472
Why do I let them get to me?

1373
02:25:17,505 --> 02:25:19,574
I should feel sorry for them.

1374
02:25:19,607 --> 02:25:22,977
But this is my home.
It's my sanctuary.

1375
02:25:23,012 --> 02:25:24,412
[inhaler hisses]

- I could wish them... [grunts]
- [static buzzes]

1378
02:25:30,119 --> 02:25:32,320
That's not a wish, by the way.

1379
02:25:32,353 --> 02:25:33,722
- I know.
- [exhales heavily]

[The Djinn] How was your day?

1388
02:27:40,915 --> 02:27:43,285
[Alithea] Every listening ear
was yours.

1389
02:27:43,319 --> 02:27:46,088
Every voice, every scent,
and touch.

1390
02:27:46,121 --> 02:27:47,789
You were everywhere.

1391
02:27:53,095 --> 02:27:54,729
Back in a minute.

1392
02:28:13,648 --> 02:28:15,750
[Fanny] Whoever could that be
at this hour?

[Clementine]
It could be her.

Clem. Fanny.

Chickpeas, cloves, pistachio.

02:28:29,631 --> 02:28:31,466
They melt in your mouth.

1397
02:28:49,318 --> 02:28:50,952
This is my friend.

1398
02:28:52,154 --> 02:28:53,988
He'll be staying for a while.

1399
02:28:54,956 --> 02:28:55,957
Hello.

1400
02:28:59,094 --> 02:29:00,795
- Hello.
- Hello.

1401
02:29:05,100 --> 02:29:06,668
[Alithea] <i>My Djinn told me,</i>

1402
02:29:06,701 --> 02:29:09,637
<i>when they come together
in the Realm of Djinn,</i>

1403
02:29:09,671 --> 02:29:11,572
<i>they tell each other stories.</i>

1404
02:29:12,640 --> 02:29:14,909
<i>Stories are like breath to them.</i>

1405
02:29:14,943 --> 02:29:15,977
<i>They make meaning.</i>

1406
02:29:17,979 --> 02:29:19,181
<i>"Yes," I said.</i>

1407
02:29:19,214 --> 02:29:20,982
<i>"That's just how
it is with us."</i>

1408
02:29:21,883 --> 02:29:23,618
<i>Each story we tell is a fragment</i>

1409
02:29:23,651 --> 02:29:26,188
<i>in an endless
shape-shifting mosaic.</i>

1410
02:29:27,622 --> 02:29:31,893
<i>And this small pebble,
like all stories, must end.</i>

1411
02:29:33,728 --> 02:29:37,032
<i>If it's about wishing,
it's a cautionary tale.</i>

1412
02:29:38,200 --> 02:29:41,136
<i>So, how will it go wrong?</i>

1413
02:29:41,170 --> 02:29:43,638
<i>Perhaps, it already has.</i>

1414
02:29:46,841 --> 02:29:49,311
Even though Truth
stood before them naked,

1415
02:29:49,345 --> 02:29:50,945
they turned their backs.

1416
02:29:50,979 --> 02:29:55,483
So, Truth moved to the side
and waited in the shadows.

1417
02:29:55,516 --> 02:29:56,951
<i>In the days that followed,</i>

1418
02:29:56,985 --> 02:30:00,621
<i>the Djinn would accompany
the narratologist to her work.</i>

1419
02:30:00,655 --> 02:30:02,024
<i>And when he wasn't with her,</i>

1420
02:30:02,057 --> 02:30:05,493
<i>he would go in eager
exploration of the world.</i>

[machine beeping]

1422

[The Djinn] <i>Today I had</i>
<i>such a marvelous day.</i>

1423
02:30:12,700 --> 02:30:15,670
<i>I saw many things.</i>

1424
02:30:15,703 --> 02:30:19,807
<i>I watched a human look into
the living brain of another</i>

1425
02:30:19,841 --> 02:30:22,610
<i>and arrest a fatal bleeding.</i>

1426
02:30:27,149 --> 02:30:28,850
<i>I visited the Collider.</i>

1427
02:30:30,019 --> 02:30:34,622
<i>A vast gizmo which probed
the essence of matter.</i>

1428
02:30:37,625 --> 02:30:40,862
<i>And then I saw a dish,
a great dish</i>

1429
02:30:40,895 --> 02:30:44,699
<i>that listens to the whispers
of stars long dead.</i>

1430
02:30:46,934 --> 02:30:48,703
Humankind is...

1431
02:30:48,736 --> 02:30:50,772
is a wonder, Alithea.

1432
02:30:51,539 --> 02:30:53,941
I'm happy you think so.

1433
02:30:53,975 --> 02:30:57,046
All of this since I was
trapped in Zefir's bottle.

1434
02:30:57,079 --> 02:31:02,017
All these astonishments,
in less than 200 years.

1435
02:31:02,051 --> 02:31:03,818
Yes, but, I mean,

1436
02:31:03,851 --> 02:31:08,323
that's just engineering
and technology.

1437
02:31:08,357 --> 02:31:10,758
Despite all the whiz-bang,

1438
02:31:10,792 --> 02:31:13,028
we remain bewildered.

1439
02:31:15,830 --> 02:31:17,932
When we can't contain the chaos,

1440
02:31:19,567 --> 02:31:22,337
we are filled
with dread and panic,

1441
02:31:22,371 --> 02:31:24,440
and we turn on each other.

1442
02:31:24,473 --> 02:31:27,176
But of course, you are human.

1443
02:31:27,209 --> 02:31:29,244
That is your nature.

1444
02:31:31,480 --> 02:31:35,050
Yeah. So, the story
never changes.

1445
02:31:36,051 --> 02:31:38,520
Hate prevails.

1446
02:31:38,554 --> 02:31:43,258
It metastasizes
and outlives love.

1447
02:31:44,926 --> 02:31:47,595
I just want to talk about love.

1448
02:31:47,628 --> 02:31:51,632
Such a mess of
contradictions, all of you.

1449
02:31:51,666 --> 02:31:52,767
Thank you very much.

1450
02:31:52,800 --> 02:31:56,238
Humankind, what a conundrum.

1451
02:31:56,271 --> 02:31:58,806
You fumble around in the dark,

1452
02:31:58,840 --> 02:32:02,144
and yet, you herd your
intelligence to great effect.

1453
02:32:02,177 --> 02:32:03,579
It is quite a story.

1454
02:32:03,611 --> 02:32:04,846
[chuckles softly]

1455
02:32:04,879 --> 02:32:07,715
Cannot wait to see
where it goes.

1456
02:32:07,748 --> 02:32:09,817
Or how it might end.

1457
02:32:10,219 --> 02:32:11,719
That too.

1458
02:32:11,752 --> 02:32:15,690
A mortal will never know,
but a djinn might.

1459
02:32:15,723 --> 02:32:18,293
A djinn has all the time
in the world.

1460
02:32:20,462 --> 02:32:22,464
Aren't you the lucky one?

1461
02:32:22,498 --> 02:32:23,965
Maybe.

1462
02:32:24,866 --> 02:32:28,270
But you creatures
of dust have...

1463
02:32:28,303 --> 02:32:29,637
have managed to eclipse

1464
02:32:29,670 --> 02:32:33,175
the power and purpose
of djinn and angel.

1465
02:32:33,208 --> 02:32:35,377
You have no use for us.

1466
02:32:35,410 --> 02:32:36,588
Perhaps, we will wither and...

1467
02:32:36,612 --> 02:32:38,080
- And fade away?
- Yes.

1468
02:32:38,113 --> 02:32:40,549
Yeah. Well, that used
to be the subject

1469
02:32:40,582 --> 02:32:42,650
of all my lectures and papers.

1470
02:32:42,683 --> 02:32:44,086
I know.

1471
02:32:46,588 --> 02:32:48,423
And yet, here you are.

1472
02:32:50,225 --> 02:32:52,227
My impossible.

1473
02:32:54,229 --> 02:32:55,230
Yes.

Hello?

1477
02:33:14,349 --> 02:33:15,917
I'm home!

1478
02:33:25,960 --> 02:33:27,162
Hello?

1479
02:33:46,747 --> 02:33:47,949
[switch clicks]

1480
02:33:53,288 --> 02:33:54,789
Djinn?

1481
02:33:58,694 --> 02:33:59,860
My love?

1482
02:33:59,894 --> 02:34:01,230
[Alithea gasps]

1483
02:34:04,099 --> 02:34:05,100

[switch clicks]

02:34:09,371 --> 02:34:10,472
What's this?

1486
02:34:13,175 --> 02:34:14,942
Can you hear me?

1487
02:34:14,976 --> 02:34:17,312
Djinn, speak to me.

1488
02:34:17,346 --> 02:34:18,846
Try to speak to me.

1489
02:34:20,682 --> 02:34:22,984
I wish you to speak to me.

1490

I was sleeping.

1498
02:34:44,905 --> 02:34:47,242
[grunts] Sleeping.

1499
02:34:48,876 --> 02:34:50,978
Djinn don't sleep.

1500
02:34:51,013 --> 02:34:52,481
[The Djinn] Let's go for a walk.

1501
02:34:52,514 --> 02:34:53,749
A long, bracing walk.

1502
02:34:53,781 --> 02:34:55,317
I have prepared
something for us.

1503
02:34:55,350 --> 02:34:56,951
[in normal voice]
I have it all planned.

1504
02:34:56,984 --> 02:34:59,321
[breathlessly]
A wonderous night for us.

1505
02:34:59,354 --> 02:35:01,290
It will be amazing.

1506
02:35:01,323 --> 02:35:04,092
- The best time of our lives.
- Stop!

1507
02:35:04,126 --> 02:35:08,430
These electromagnetic fields,
I can push them from my head.

1508
02:35:08,463 --> 02:35:09,997
I can push them away.

1509
02:35:10,931 --> 02:35:12,334
We'll go for a picnic.

1510

[speaking Djinnbish]

1514
02:35:21,809 --> 02:35:25,280
Alithea, there is a place
for me here.

1515
02:35:25,314 --> 02:35:26,248
These forces,

1516
02:35:26,281 --> 02:35:28,050
they will never go away,
not from this world.

1517
02:35:28,083 --> 02:35:30,252
I will overcome them.
I can do that for you.

1518
02:35:30,285 --> 02:35:32,421
You are my Alithea,
and I love you.

1519
02:35:32,454 --> 02:35:34,222
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you for trying.

1520
02:35:34,256 --> 02:35:35,536
You don't think that I love you?

1521
02:35:36,658 --> 02:35:38,660
Love is a gift.

1522
02:35:38,694 --> 02:35:41,063
It's a gift of oneself
given freely.

1523
02:35:41,096 --> 02:35:43,432
It's not something
one can ever ask for.

1524
02:35:44,832 --> 02:35:46,034
I tricked us both.

1525

The moment I spoke that wish,

1526
02:35:47,769 --> 02:35:50,838
I took away
your power to grant it.

1527

I, more than anybody,
I should've known that.

I'm not going
to screw this up again.

My Djinn, if this world
is not for you,

I wish that you return
to where you belong.
