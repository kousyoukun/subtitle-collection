1
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:09,515
[soft eerie music playing]

2
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,122
My name is Alithea.

3
00:00:51,122 --> 00:00:53,776
My story is true.

4
00:00:53,776 --> 00:00:56,170
You're more likely
to believe me, however,

5
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,390
if I tell it
as a fairy tale.

6
00:01:01,045 --> 00:01:03,699
So, once upon a time,

7
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:07,486
when humans
hurtled across the sky
on metal wings,

8
00:01:08,356 --> 00:01:09,749
when they wore
webbed feet

9
00:01:09,749 --> 00:01:12,099
and walked
on the bottom of the sea,

10
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:15,537
when they held
in their hands glass tiles

11
00:01:15,537 --> 00:01:18,105
that could coax
love songs from the air...

12
00:01:18,105 --> 00:01:19,802
[music playing
through headphones]

13
00:01:19,802 --> 00:01:22,849
...there was a woman,
adequately happy and alone.

14
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,634
Alone by choice.

15
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:28,550
Happy because
she was independent,

16
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:31,640
living off the exercise
of her scholarly mind.

17
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:35,383
Her business was story.

18
00:01:36,645 --> 00:01:38,386
She was
a narratologist

19
00:01:38,386 --> 00:01:40,171
who sought
to find the truths

20
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:43,130
common to all the stories
of humankind.

21
00:01:44,392 --> 00:01:47,221
To this end,
once or twice a year,

22
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:49,832
she ventured
to strange lands.

23
00:01:49,832 --> 00:01:52,574
To China,
the South Seas,

24
00:01:52,574 --> 00:01:54,794
and the timeless cities
of the Levant...

25
00:01:58,798 --> 00:02:03,368
where her kind gathered
to tell stories about stories.

26
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:07,111
[man 1] This way.

27
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:09,156
-[Alithea] Excuse me.
-[man 1] This way, lady.

28
00:02:09,156 --> 00:02:10,810
What are you doing?
Can you let go, please?

29
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,247
The mysteries of Istanbul.

30
00:02:13,247 --> 00:02:15,423
[static buzzing]

31
00:02:15,423 --> 00:02:17,295
-[man 2] Alithea!
-[man 1 grunts]

32
00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:18,905
Alithea!

33
00:02:23,823 --> 00:02:25,477
Welcome!

34
00:02:25,477 --> 00:02:27,174
-Welcome at last! Aw.
-Gunhan!

35
00:02:27,174 --> 00:02:29,307
-[both laugh]
-My dear friend.

36
00:02:29,307 --> 00:02:30,786
-[Alithea] Oh, how wonderful!
-[Gunhan] I'm sorry.

37
00:02:30,786 --> 00:02:32,484
-This is Amina.
-Amina.

38
00:02:32,484 --> 00:02:34,268
From the British Council.

39
00:02:35,835 --> 00:02:38,446
That fellow at the airport
manhandling my luggage,

40
00:02:38,446 --> 00:02:39,665
did you see him?

41
00:02:39,665 --> 00:02:40,883
What fellow?

42
00:02:42,276 --> 00:02:44,670
He scuttled off
when you arrived.

43
00:02:45,627 --> 00:02:49,892
Small, sheepskin jacket,
pink collar.

44
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,635
Interesting.

45
00:02:54,593 --> 00:02:56,856
He was hot to touch.

46
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,250
Musky.

47
00:02:59,772 --> 00:03:01,469
Perhaps he was a djinn.

48
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:03,950
An illegal taxi driver,
more likely.

49
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,908
Wearing too much cologne.

50
00:03:05,908 --> 00:03:07,780
So, Professor,

51
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,304
you saying
you believe in djinn?

52
00:03:10,304 --> 00:03:13,220
I believe there are those
who need to believe in them.

53
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,352
Including me?

54
00:03:14,352 --> 00:03:15,744
Djinn, ghosts,

55
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,530
aliens, whatever helps.

56
00:03:21,446 --> 00:03:22,882
[Gunhan laughs]

57
00:03:24,927 --> 00:03:27,713
The hotel's arranged
a lovely surprise for you.

58
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,850
It's the Agatha Christie room.

59
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,156
In this room,

60
00:03:36,156 --> 00:03:38,767
she wrote
Murder on the Orient Express.

61
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:44,686
[sighs]

62
00:03:44,686 --> 00:03:46,688
[audience laughing]

63
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:48,821
[Gunhan chuckles]

64
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:51,563
[Gunhan] So,
how would you explain

65
00:03:51,563 --> 00:03:53,956
the power
of a thunderstorm

66
00:03:53,956 --> 00:03:55,349
if you don't have the means

67
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:57,830
to measure and model
meteorological data?

68
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:01,747
How can you
explain the seasons?

69
00:04:01,747 --> 00:04:04,532
Autumn through winter
to spring and summer,

70
00:04:04,532 --> 00:04:06,708
if you don't know
that the Earth

71
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,363
orbits the Sun
while tilted on an axis?

72
00:04:10,538 --> 00:04:12,627
Everything was mystery.

73
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:17,719
The seasons, tsunamis,
microbial disease...

74
00:04:17,719 --> 00:04:21,810
What else could we do
but resort to stories?

75
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,857
As Dr. Binnie
has encouraged
us to understand,

76
00:04:24,857 --> 00:04:26,946
stories were once
the only way

77
00:04:26,946 --> 00:04:29,514
to make our bewildering
existence coherent.

78
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:31,298
That's exactly right.

79
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:33,996
We gave name
to the unknown forces

80
00:04:33,996 --> 00:04:37,043
behind all wonder
and catastrophe,

81
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,437
by telling each other...

82
00:04:42,831 --> 00:04:45,878
By telling
each other stories.

83
00:04:45,878 --> 00:04:47,662
-[Gunhan] let me show you.
-[static buzzes]

84
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:52,406
We told tales of specific,
powerful, relatable gods

85
00:04:52,406 --> 00:04:55,801
ever present in all cultures,
in all mythologies,

86
00:04:55,801 --> 00:04:58,847
from the Greeks,
to the Romans, to the Norse,

87
00:04:58,847 --> 00:05:00,719
and so on,
and so on.

88
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:04,070
The familiar descendant
of Zeus, Poseidon, Athena,

89
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,638
Thor, the whole gang,

90
00:05:06,638 --> 00:05:09,293
find expression
even today.

91
00:05:09,293 --> 00:05:10,772
[low electrical humming]

92
00:05:10,772 --> 00:05:13,601
These are
their vestiges.

93
00:05:15,386 --> 00:05:18,780
The question remains,
what is their purpose?

94
00:05:21,348 --> 00:05:24,351
[electrical humming continues]

95
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,310
What do we require
of them now?

96
00:05:28,486 --> 00:05:31,663
There is mythos,
and there is science.

97
00:05:31,663 --> 00:05:33,621
[electrical humming stops]

98
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:36,102
[Alithea softly] Oh. Sorry.

99
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:40,585
Mythology is what
we knew back then.

100
00:05:40,585 --> 00:05:43,718
Science is what
we know so far.

101
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,894
[low electrical humming
resumes]

102
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,725
Sooner or later,

103
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,554
our creation stories
are replaced

104
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,469
by the narratives of science.

105
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,864
Painstaking science.

106
00:05:58,864 --> 00:06:00,866
And all gods and monsters

107
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:04,043
outlive their original purpose

108
00:06:05,044 --> 00:06:07,525
and are reduced
to metaphor.

109
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:09,701
Rubbish! [roars]

110
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,053
[Gunhan muffled] Alithea!

111
00:06:14,053 --> 00:06:15,881
[woman speaking indistinctly]

112
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,450
[Gunhan] Alithea.

113
00:06:20,494 --> 00:06:21,669
[woman] What happened?

114
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:23,105
[Gunhan] I don't know.
She just fell.

115
00:06:23,105 --> 00:06:25,020
-She just fell.
-[Amina grunts]

116
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,066
[Amina] Gosh. [exclaiming]

117
00:06:33,942 --> 00:06:35,422
[Gunhan] Are you okay?

118
00:06:35,857 --> 00:06:38,120
[audience clapping]

119
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:44,605
[rattling]

120
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,478
[Gunhan] Shouldn't
you see a doctor?

121
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:49,001
[Alithea] Why?
When I feel so well?

122
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:51,438
[Gunhan] Forgive me, Alithea.
Are you sure?

123
00:06:51,438 --> 00:06:53,701
[Alithea] Apart from
the usual aches and pains,

124
00:06:53,701 --> 00:06:55,399
there is nothing untoward.

125
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,096
There's no reason
to make a fuss.

126
00:06:57,096 --> 00:06:58,967
[Gunhan] So, what happened
back there?

127
00:07:03,058 --> 00:07:06,932
Lately, my imagination's
been getting the better of me.

128
00:07:07,672 --> 00:07:09,674
Ambushing me.

129
00:07:09,674 --> 00:07:10,849
I think it's a warning.

130
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:12,111
About what?

131
00:07:13,547 --> 00:07:15,549
Not to be complacent.

132
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:17,899
To keep on my toes.

133
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:20,554
It manifests rudely
from time to time.

134
00:07:20,554 --> 00:07:23,122
I try not to fight it off.

135
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:26,952
It takes charge for a moment,
and then it steps back.

136
00:07:26,952 --> 00:07:28,519
What steps back?

137
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:31,609
Oh, Gunhan,
it's irrational.
Pay it no mind.

138
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:36,483
[Gunhan] You are behaving like
a child. Do you know that?

139
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:37,919
[Alithea] You know,
I am actually a child.

140
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,486
[Gunhan laughs]

141
00:07:39,486 --> 00:07:42,228
[people chattering
indistinctly]

142
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,144
[Alithea] If there is fate,
can we escape it?

143
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:47,146
Who can say?

144
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:49,975
But I tell you this,

145
00:07:49,975 --> 00:07:52,194
in the Grand Bazaar
of Istanbul,

146
00:07:52,194 --> 00:07:57,112
there are 62 streets
and 4,000 shops.

147
00:07:57,112 --> 00:08:00,246
And in one of those shops,
there are three rooms.

148
00:08:01,508 --> 00:08:03,162
In the smallest
of those rooms,

149
00:08:03,162 --> 00:08:05,773
there was a pile
of things unsorted,

150
00:08:05,773 --> 00:08:07,471
old and new.

151
00:08:08,515 --> 00:08:10,474
From the bottom of that pile,

152
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:13,085
I chose a memento.

153
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,788
Do you know what this is?

154
00:08:20,788 --> 00:08:23,661
I'm not sure,
but it could be Cesm-i Bulbul,

155
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:25,184
a "Nightingale's Eye."

156
00:08:25,184 --> 00:08:28,535
Around 1845, there were
these glassmakers in Incirkoy.

157
00:08:28,535 --> 00:08:31,146
They were famous for this
spiral blue-white pattern.

158
00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:33,192
Oh, please.
It's a gift from me.

159
00:08:33,192 --> 00:08:35,063
Choose something less forlorn.

160
00:08:38,502 --> 00:08:42,288
And, uh, if this
is Cesm-i Bulbul,

161
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,812
uh, is there a way
of authenticating it?

162
00:08:44,812 --> 00:08:46,553
Well, they say
that if it is genuine,

163
00:08:46,553 --> 00:08:48,555
sometimes you can see

there was a boy.

Your first lover?

266
00:15:41,228 --> 00:15:44,144
No, no, no.
He was not of flesh and blood.

268
00:15:45,406 --> 00:15:47,539
No.

269
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:51,412
At that time, I found myself
in a school for girls.

272
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:01,205
And this boy, Enzo,

273
00:16:01,205 --> 00:16:04,121
he came to me,
out of an emptiness.

274
00:16:05,383 --> 00:16:08,342
Out of a need to imagine.

275
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,257
He told me stories
in a language

276
00:16:10,257 --> 00:16:12,520
that only we two spoke.

277
00:16:14,044 --> 00:16:16,220
And he always disappeared
when I had a headache,

278
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,482
but he was never far away

279

for asthma.

00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,270

282
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,185
An emanation?

283
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:28,101
[Alithea] Only an emanation
of an absence.

284

[breathing laboriously]

285
00:16:31,104 --> 00:16:34,412
I feared he would leave,
and so I wrote him down.

286
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:41,071
And I filled this journal,
bulging with facts.

287
00:16:42,463 --> 00:16:46,641
But the more realism
I tried to insert,

288
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:49,644
the more I began to doubt,

289
00:16:49,644 --> 00:16:52,734
and, uh, it all began
to feel silly.

290
00:16:54,084 --> 00:16:55,650
I felt silly.

291
00:16:57,478 --> 00:17:00,133
So, after a time,

292
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:02,483
I burned it all
in the school furnace.

293
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:07,488
And after that,
he disappeared altogether.

294
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,362
And yet, I am here.

295
00:17:13,581 --> 00:17:15,627
Contrary to reason, yes.

Well, I'd like to show you

That's so kind. Thank you.

when you get a chance.

-Maybe another time.
-It will be great.

00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:22,754
Ah, it's quite a story.

330
00:19:23,668 --> 00:19:25,757
That was
my third incarceration.

331
00:19:25,757 --> 00:19:27,846
You've been trapped
in a bottle three times?

332
00:19:27,846 --> 00:19:30,196
I may be a djinn,
but I'm also a fool

333
00:19:30,196 --> 00:19:32,807
with too great a fondness
for the conversation of women.

334
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:35,201
I need to be more careful
in the future.

335
00:19:35,201 --> 00:19:36,594
How were you caught
in the first place?

336
00:19:37,464 --> 00:19:39,162
By desire.

337
00:19:39,162 --> 00:19:40,815
How else?

338
00:19:43,688 --> 00:19:45,298
Who was she?

339
00:19:45,298 --> 00:19:46,778
Sheba.

340
00:19:46,778 --> 00:19:48,171
The Queen of Sheba?

341
00:19:48,171 --> 00:19:49,694
She was my kin.

342
00:19:49,694 --> 00:19:50,825
She was a djinn?

343
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:52,349
Her mother was a djinn.

344
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:53,437
Is that possible?

345
00:19:53,437 --> 00:19:54,655
There are laws that allow

346
00:19:54,655 --> 00:19:56,179
the union
of djinn and mortals,

347
00:19:56,179 --> 00:19:57,919
but they cannot produce
an immortal scion

348
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,225
the way a donkey and a horse

349
00:19:59,225 --> 00:20:01,184
can only produce
a seedless mule.

350
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:05,971
So, what did she look like?

351
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:10,193
Other than a thick glade
of black hair on her legs,

352
00:20:10,193 --> 00:20:11,585
she looked like
any other human being,

353
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,892
except, of course,
she was Sheba.

354
00:20:13,892 --> 00:20:16,503
By all accounts,
she was very beautiful.

355
00:20:16,503 --> 00:20:19,463
She was not beautiful.
She was beauty itself.

356
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,817
I was in every way free.

357
00:20:25,817 --> 00:20:28,820
I would come in and out
of her sleeping chamber.

358
00:20:29,951 --> 00:20:32,476
[whispers] Sheba...

359
00:20:34,217 --> 00:20:35,957
[blows]

360
00:20:35,957 --> 00:20:38,873
I knew as well as any
of her female slaves

361
00:20:38,873 --> 00:20:41,876
the touches that made
her shiver with bliss.

362
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,532
Never have I wanted
a creature so.

363
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,839
And she desired you in return?

364
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:51,234
I was her plaything.
Her confidante.

365
00:20:51,234 --> 00:20:53,497
I might have become more,
but for Solomon.

366
00:20:53,497 --> 00:20:54,715
King Solomon?

367
00:20:54,715 --> 00:20:56,717
Blessed be his memory.

368
00:20:56,717 --> 00:20:58,980
He came from across
the deserts to woo her.

369
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,286
Didn't she go to him?

370
00:21:00,286 --> 00:21:01,635
No. Never.

371
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,463
But it's in
all the holy books.

372
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:04,943
All the stories
and the paintings.

373
00:21:04,943 --> 00:21:06,727
And Handel wrote music
about it.

374
00:21:06,727 --> 00:21:08,338
Madam, I was there.

375
00:21:08,338 --> 00:21:10,035
Solomon came to her.

376
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,777
[people chattering

he began with music.

380
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,459

[gulps]

387
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:14,420
I did all that I could
to dissuade her.

388
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,552
But when she used

389
00:23:15,552 --> 00:23:17,423
the scented wax
of the Jabassa Bee

390
00:23:17,423 --> 00:23:18,990
to remove the hair
from her legs,

391
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,687
I knew that I was lost.

392
00:23:20,687 --> 00:23:23,037
But I, like a fool,
went on telling her

393
00:23:23,037 --> 00:23:26,040
that her body
was rich and lovely,

394
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,695
but her mind
was richer and lovelier,

395
00:23:28,695 --> 00:23:30,480
and more durable.

396
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,569
And she agreed
with all that I said,

397
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:34,179
and dropped a hot tear.

398
00:23:35,572 --> 00:23:38,575
She began to set him tasks,
which seemed impossible,

399
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:40,707
to find a particular thread
of red silk

400
00:23:40,707 --> 00:23:42,709
in the palace
of a thousand rooms,

401
00:23:42,709 --> 00:23:45,582
to guess the secret name
of her mother djinn,

402
00:23:45,582 --> 00:23:48,889
[inhales] to tell her
what women most desire.

403
00:23:48,889 --> 00:23:50,761
That does seem impossible.

404
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:52,023
Not for him.

405
00:23:52,023 --> 00:23:53,546
He could speak
to the beasts of the earth,

406
00:23:53,546 --> 00:23:55,983
and to the djinn
made of subtle fire.

407
00:23:55,983 --> 00:23:59,073
He found ants to discover
the thread of silk,

408
00:23:59,073 --> 00:24:01,162
and an ifrit to whisper
the mother's name.

409
00:24:01,162 --> 00:24:03,600
[ifrit speaking indistinctly]

410
00:24:06,472 --> 00:24:07,995
[The Djinn] Then he looked
into her eyes

411
00:24:07,995 --> 00:24:11,085
and told her
what women most desire.

412
00:24:11,085 --> 00:24:13,174
[King Solomon speaking
early Aramaic]

413
00:24:13,174 --> 00:24:14,785
[The Djinn] She was astonished,

414
00:24:16,134 --> 00:24:17,962
and told him he was right.

415
00:24:22,488 --> 00:24:26,013
And so she granted him
what he most desired,

416
00:24:26,013 --> 00:24:28,886
which was to wed her
and be taken to her bed.

417
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,065
[Sheba gasps]

[speaks early Aramaic]

422

[The Djinn]
He was a great magician...

423
00:24:50,777 --> 00:24:52,257
-[wheezing]
-...and imprisoned me

424
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:55,478
with a word of power
into a brass bottle.

425

[emotional string
music continues]

426
00:25:21,634 --> 00:25:23,767
She made no plea for me.

427
00:25:24,768 --> 00:25:27,161
I was nothing to her.

428
00:25:27,161 --> 00:25:29,076
A breath in a bottle.

429
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,616
And so, I was cast
into the Red Sea

430
00:25:46,616 --> 00:25:50,228
and languished
for 2,500 years.

431
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:57,191
Apart from sleep,

432
00:25:57,191 --> 00:26:00,151
what does one do in a bottle
for 2,500 years?

433

Djinn don't sleep.

434
00:26:08,855 --> 00:26:10,553
So, how do you manage then?

435
00:26:11,205 --> 00:26:12,293
[clicks tongue]

436
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:18,604
Well, for the first 100 years,
I rage against my fate.

437
00:26:18,604 --> 00:26:20,345
I pray to Boschkolo
for my release,

438
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,781
and when that does not work,

439
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:23,261
I pray to any god I know,

440
00:26:23,261 --> 00:26:25,219
and then to any god
I may not know.

441
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:27,918
And when, still,
I find no answers,

442
00:26:27,918 --> 00:26:29,006
[inhales]

443
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:31,095
I spend my time
in waking dreams

444
00:26:31,095 --> 00:26:33,880
revisiting all the stories
of my life.

445
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,840
And when I have exhausted this
many, many times,

446
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,886
I return to my prayer
and my rage.

447
00:26:39,886 --> 00:26:42,846
And then, finally,

448
00:26:44,195 --> 00:26:46,327
I play a trick on myself.

449
00:26:47,764 --> 00:26:49,243
I pray to remain
in the bottle.

450
00:26:49,243 --> 00:26:53,073
I beseech Boschkolo to keep me
always in the bottle.

451
00:26:53,073 --> 00:26:54,640
And does that work?

452
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,120
To yearn for nothing?

453
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,991
To pretend to want
nothing more

454
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,732
than to be contained
in a bottle?

455
00:26:59,732 --> 00:27:01,212
No.

456
00:27:01,212 --> 00:27:03,954
For a djinn, it is the closest
we ever come to death.

457
00:27:05,129 --> 00:27:06,826
[sighs]

458
00:27:06,826 --> 00:27:08,611
Do you know the answer
to her question?

459
00:27:08,611 --> 00:27:09,786
What women most desire?

460
00:27:09,786 --> 00:27:10,917
Yeah.

461
00:27:10,917 --> 00:27:12,658
Do you not know?

462
00:27:12,658 --> 00:27:14,181
If you do not know,
I cannot tell you.

463
00:27:14,181 --> 00:27:16,357
Well, surely, we don't
all want the same thing.

464
00:27:16,357 --> 00:27:19,970
Madam, your yearnings
are not at all clear to me.

465
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:23,277
I... I'm at a point in my life
where I have all I need.

466
00:27:23,277 --> 00:27:25,845
I daresay I'm content,
and gratefully so.

467
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:26,977
Tell me.

468
00:27:26,977 --> 00:27:29,370
Are you a wife? A widow?

469
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:31,634
-Um...
-A mother, perhaps?

470
00:27:31,634 --> 00:27:34,158
I have no children,
no siblings, no parents.

471
00:27:35,942 --> 00:27:37,248
I did once have a husband.

472
00:27:37,248 --> 00:27:38,510
[The Djinn] Ah.

473
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,643
And what was the complexion
of this husband?

474
00:27:41,165 --> 00:27:42,645
His complexion?

475
00:27:42,645 --> 00:27:45,822
In the beginning,
it was glowing.

476
00:27:45,822 --> 00:27:47,650
And in the ending?

477
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,173
It's not much of a story.

478
00:27:49,173 --> 00:27:52,089
But it is a story.
It is your story,

479
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:53,743
and it is always wise

480
00:27:53,743 --> 00:27:55,701
to understand those
who have a hold on you.

481
00:27:55,701 --> 00:27:56,789
Please.

482
00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:57,877
[inhales deeply]

483
00:27:58,965 --> 00:28:01,185
[grunts] Well, okay, um...

484
00:28:02,273 --> 00:28:03,666
[smacks lips]

485
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:06,146
We'd known each other
since our youth.

486
00:28:06,146 --> 00:28:08,018
We, uh, married early.

487
00:28:08,018 --> 00:28:09,976
In the beginning,
we took pleasure

488
00:28:09,976 --> 00:28:11,804
in each other's minds
and bodies.

489
00:28:11,804 --> 00:28:13,153
Um...

490
00:28:13,153 --> 00:28:14,981
We passed
the years comfortably,

491
00:28:14,981 --> 00:28:17,375
and then as it happens,

492
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:20,160
it all evaporated,

493
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,206
and, uh... and we became

494
00:28:23,337 --> 00:28:24,382
less.

495
00:28:24,382 --> 00:28:25,252
And where is he?

496
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,040
He's in Hackney,
with Emmeline Porter.

497
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,215
[The Djinn] Mmm.

[Alithea sighs]

499
00:28:37,395 --> 00:28:39,353
[Alithea] He told me I...

500
00:28:39,353 --> 00:28:41,834
I was incapable
of reading feelings.

501

[Emmeline] ...gonna have
a resolution.

505
00:28:50,234 --> 00:28:51,409
[Jack] This is exciting!

506
00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:52,976
-It is exciting!
-[Emmeline] No, it's not.

507
00:28:52,976 --> 00:28:54,412
Let me guess.
No one dies in it.

508
00:28:54,412 --> 00:28:56,153
[Emmeline laughing] No!

509
00:28:56,153 --> 00:28:59,983
[Alithea] The way my brain
is wired is... is the...

510
00:28:59,983 --> 00:29:02,986
the source both of my power

511
00:29:02,986 --> 00:29:05,728
and, uh, and my solitude.

512
00:29:06,729 --> 00:29:08,905
I suspect that's why
I like stories.

513
00:29:09,819 --> 00:29:12,473
I find feelings
through stories.

514
00:29:12,473 --> 00:29:14,824
[The Djinn sighs]

515
00:29:16,042 --> 00:29:19,002
Perhaps you could
wish for him back.

516
00:29:19,002 --> 00:29:21,134
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no.

517
00:29:21,308 --> 00:29:22,396
No.

518
00:29:23,484 --> 00:29:26,139
I... I thought, um,

519
00:29:27,227 --> 00:29:31,057
I might grieve
a loss and betrayal, but, uh,

520
00:29:32,363 --> 00:29:34,060
no, in fact, I was free.

521
00:29:35,453 --> 00:29:37,803
I was like a prisoner

522
00:29:37,803 --> 00:29:41,415
emerging from a dungeon
into the sunlight.

523
00:29:41,415 --> 00:29:44,244
I expanded into the space
of my own life.

524
00:29:44,244 --> 00:29:48,422
No, I could not wish for more.

525
00:29:48,422 --> 00:29:51,425
You are a wise
and cautious woman, Alithea.

526
00:29:51,425 --> 00:29:54,080
But we all have desires,

527
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,952
even if they remain
hidden from us.

528

[inhales sharply]

529

That's as maybe.

530
00:29:59,912 --> 00:30:04,830
But I am also
a narratologist,

531
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,311
and that is going
to be a problem.

532
00:30:07,311 --> 00:30:09,574
It's going to be
a very big problem.

533
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,794
See, I know
all the stories there are

534
00:30:11,794 --> 00:30:13,143
about trickster djinn,

535
00:30:13,143 --> 00:30:14,448
and the ways in which
they manipulate wishing

536
00:30:14,448 --> 00:30:15,536
to their own ends.

537
00:30:15,536 --> 00:30:16,842
I am not one of them.

538
00:30:16,842 --> 00:30:18,801
I am god-fearing
and honorable,

539
00:30:18,801 --> 00:30:21,064
and only here
to grant your heart's desire.

540
00:30:21,064 --> 00:30:23,153
Well, even if that's true,

541
00:30:23,153 --> 00:30:26,330
how can you rely on those
called upon to wish?

542

[speaks ancient Greek]

543
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:31,161
How do you know
you can rely on me?

544
00:30:32,292 --> 00:30:34,338
Well, I hope so.

545
00:30:34,338 --> 00:30:37,167
With you,
I certainly hope so.

546
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:39,386
There's a...

547
00:30:39,386 --> 00:30:42,302
funny little story.
I mean, you probably know it.

548
00:30:42,302 --> 00:30:44,261
Three friends lost at sea
in a tiny boat.

549
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:46,002
They pull up a magic fish,

550
00:30:46,002 --> 00:30:47,568
who grants each of them
one wish.

551
00:30:47,568 --> 00:30:48,700
The first one,

552
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,484
"I wish I were at home
with my wife."

553
00:30:50,484 --> 00:30:51,659
He vanishes.

554
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:53,270
The second one,
"I wish I were playing

555
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,575
"in the fields
with my children."

556
00:30:54,575 --> 00:30:55,794
Off he goes.

557
00:30:55,794 --> 00:30:58,318
And the third one,
"I miss my friends..."

558
00:30:58,318 --> 00:30:59,363
"I wish they were here."

559
00:30:59,363 --> 00:31:01,017
You've got it.

560
00:31:01,017 --> 00:31:04,281
There's no story about wishing
that is not a cautionary tale.

561
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:06,196
None end happily.

562
00:31:06,196 --> 00:31:08,111
Not even the ones
that are supposed to be jokes.

563
00:31:08,111 --> 00:31:10,417
But you and I
are the authors of this story,

564
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:12,942
and we can avoid all traps.

565
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,033
Well, what if
I made no wish at all?

566

saw none but her.

to protect his throne

over his beloved Mustafa.

I despair of

Hope is a monster, Alithea,
and I am its plaything.

820
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:43,932
So he died?

821
00:47:43,932 --> 00:47:45,281
Not in battle.

822

He is last

He has to produce
male children.

829
00:48:04,866 --> 00:48:09,392
So, Kosem locks him in a cage
lined entirely with sable.

[Alithea] Quite the prison.

831
00:48:18,531 --> 00:48:21,012
[The Djinn] And one
he will never want to leave.

[Ibrahim sniffs]

It debauches him royally.

He believes the greater
the expanse of flesh,

the more intense the pleasure.

836
00:48:43,252 --> 00:48:47,212
So, Kosem seeks out beauties
voluptuous and immense,

837
00:48:47,212 --> 00:48:50,433

he cannot shed
his robes of blood.

I don't want to interrupt,
but I do have a question.

Did it matter to you

No.

Not even if
it were profoundly evil?

Not if it meant my freedom.

860
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:21,654
The truth is he has
other things on his mind.

He believes he is invincible,

981
00:58:53,818 --> 00:58:54,950
Not necessarily.

982
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:55,994
Well, it's there
in all your own stories.

983
00:58:55,994 --> 00:58:57,082
I know, but...

984
00:58:57,082 --> 00:58:58,693
You say
you're not a trickster,

985
00:58:58,693 --> 00:59:02,087
and you say that you and I
are the authors of this story.

986
00:59:02,087 --> 00:59:05,134
But I'm not able
to write myself out of it.

987
00:59:05,134 --> 00:59:06,396
Correct.

988
00:59:06,396 --> 00:59:10,139
Why don't you just hop back
into your bottle

989
00:59:10,139 --> 00:59:11,880
and I'll give it
to someone more gullible?

990
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,839
Someone more desperate.
Someone more greedy.

991
00:59:14,839 --> 00:59:16,014
I'm not getting back
in the bottle.

992
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:17,102
Why not?

993
00:59:17,102 --> 00:59:18,930
I'm not getting back
in the bottle.

994
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,932
Well, I am not
making three wishes.

995
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:23,108
Then you are sending me
to my oblivion.

996
00:59:23,108 --> 00:59:24,588
Oh, you're impossible.

997
00:59:24,588 --> 00:59:26,590
And you are giving me
a headache.

998
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:28,287
All right. All right.

999
00:59:28,287 --> 00:59:30,855
Here's what I'll do.
I will make three wishes.

1000
00:59:30,855 --> 00:59:31,987
-I will.
-Before you die?

1001
00:59:31,987 --> 00:59:33,771
Right now.
One after the other.

1002
00:59:33,771 --> 00:59:34,990
-Ready?
-Mmm-hmm.

1003
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:37,688
Number one. I wish
your headache were gone.

1004
00:59:40,691 --> 00:59:42,301
Number two.

1005
00:59:42,301 --> 00:59:44,260
I wish for a sip of this tea.

1006
00:59:46,697 --> 00:59:49,744
And finally, I wish
for another one of those.

1007
00:59:49,744 --> 00:59:51,093
You mock me.

1008
00:59:51,093 --> 00:59:52,790
Three wishes,
perfectly simple,

1009
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:53,922
and theoretically safe.

1010
00:59:53,922 --> 00:59:56,011
I was imprisoned
by Solomon precisely

1011
00:59:56,011 --> 00:59:58,666
because I cried out
my heart's desire.

1012
00:59:58,666 --> 01:00:01,582
Only by granting you yours
may I earn my release.

1013
01:00:01,582 --> 01:00:03,018
Yes, well,
I appreciate the symmetry,

1014
01:00:03,018 --> 01:00:04,585
but the thing is this,

1015
01:00:04,585 --> 01:00:07,370
I cannot for the life of me
summon up one eligible wish.

1016
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:08,850
And you're asking me
for three.

1017
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:11,113
Is there any life in you?
Are you even alive?

1018
01:00:11,113 --> 01:00:12,941
You know, in some cultures,

1019
01:00:12,941 --> 01:00:14,682
absence of desire
means enlightenment.

1020
01:00:14,682 --> 01:00:16,901
Then you are a pious fool.

1021
01:00:16,901 --> 01:00:19,164
If I'm content,
why tempt fate?

1022
01:00:19,164 --> 01:00:20,601
And you're a coward.

1023
01:00:20,601 --> 01:00:21,950
Don't goad me.

1024
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:23,908
There is no human,
no angel, nor djinn

1025
01:00:23,908 --> 01:00:25,170
that wouldn't grasp
at the chance

to fulfill
their deepest longings,

1027
01:00:26,824 --> 01:00:28,304
and I am saddled with the one

1028
01:00:28,304 --> 01:00:29,827
who claims to want
nothing at all.

1029

Alithea Binnie,
you are a liar!

1030

You know, I am beginning
to wish we never met.

She was Zefir.

Rarely among humankind
has there been such a wonder.

[tuts and sighs]

I ended up in this
as a consequence of Zefir.

1054
01:01:56,348 --> 01:01:57,741
And this is the story

you've been avoiding
telling me all along.

[hooves clopping]

1058

Zefir was a foundling,

married at 12
to a wealthy merchant.

1060

He was much older than her,
and kind,

1061
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:30,774
if you think keeping someone
like a bird in a cage is kind.

1062

There were two older wives,

She grew to no great beauty

1070
01:03:14,949 --> 01:03:17,908
and was angry
without knowing why.

as a love token
from her husband.

It was as if
she was waiting for me.

I saw at once
that she was sharp,

and she saw
that I was desperate

01:08:56,290 --> 01:08:59,510

a mastery of love-craft,

[The Djinn in English]
And when he would come to her,

1154
01:09:36,286 --> 01:09:40,638
I would leave her room
and journey the skies.

1155
01:09:40,638 --> 01:09:44,381
I saw the mountains,
the oceans...

1156
01:09:45,339 --> 01:09:47,341
I saw the beasts
of the forest,

where no man treads.

1158

And when I would return,
she would be waiting for me.

1159
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:57,873
I would tell her of my day,
and she would faint with joy

[Alithea] Why did she not
make a wish to be free?

1162
01:10:03,487 --> 01:10:06,882
[The Djinn] There was something
more important to her.

1163
01:10:06,882 --> 01:10:09,363
She had devised
a "mathematica,"

1164
01:10:09,363 --> 01:10:12,540
a language
to explain the forces

which bring space, and time,
and matter into being.

1166

She was Promethean, brave.

1167
01:10:17,327 --> 01:10:19,590
But she could not solve
this puzzle.

1168
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,679
She needed a key,

1169
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,682

of her perception.

So, she used her second wish.

And this way,
the solutions came to her.

1176
01:11:18,562 --> 01:11:22,305
She was able
to explain powers invisible,

1177

and forces...

1178

You're electromagnetic?

1180

As you are dust,
I am made of subtle fire.

1181
01:11:35,318 --> 01:11:37,755
And when she was
to bear a child,

1182
01:11:37,755 --> 01:11:40,062
I was plagued with happiness,

1183
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:42,325
for I knew
it would strengthen us.

1184

She was carrying your child?

1185

A child, of fire and dust.

1186
01:11:49,593 --> 01:11:51,595
So, where did it go wrong?

1187
01:11:51,595 --> 01:11:53,597
Alithea, I loved her.

1188
01:11:54,598 --> 01:11:56,339
I loved the fervor
of her mind.

1189

I loved her anger.

1190
01:11:57,471 --> 01:11:58,602
I loved my power

1191

to turn her frowns
into smiles.

1192
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:05,870
I loved her more than Sheba.

1193

More than your own freedom?

1194
01:12:07,437 --> 01:12:08,917
Yes.

1195
01:12:08,917 --> 01:12:12,442
It became my greatest desire
to... to keep her,

1196
01:12:12,442 --> 01:12:14,575
to remain her prisoner.

1197
01:12:14,575 --> 01:12:19,319

Oh, gosh.

put myself in the bottle.

01:20:26,936 --> 01:20:28,024
Oh.

1302
01:20:53,049 --> 01:20:54,181
[keypad beeping]

1303
01:21:08,891 --> 01:21:10,284
In your own time.

1304
01:21:54,415 --> 01:21:56,634
[children chattering
and laughing]

1305
01:22:06,949 --> 01:22:09,038
[The Djinn]
The air is thick here.

1306
01:22:10,126 --> 01:22:14,217
Full of insistent voices
and rushing faces.

1307
01:22:14,696 --> 01:22:16,437
[Alithea] Oh?

1308
01:22:16,437 --> 01:22:19,222
Like Tiny Einstein?

1309
01:22:19,222 --> 01:22:21,398
Television, and phone towers,
and such?

1310
01:22:21,398 --> 01:22:23,139
Yes.

1311
01:22:23,139 --> 01:22:26,926
Yes. All your
ingenious devices

1312
01:22:26,926 --> 01:22:28,710
all murmuring at once.

1313
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:30,581
Bend your head.

1314
01:22:30,581 --> 01:22:33,280
[high-pitched pinging]

1315
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,412
[people clamoring
and traffic bustling]

1316
01:22:35,412 --> 01:22:37,284
-[gasps]
-[noises stop]

1317
01:22:37,284 --> 01:22:39,373
You hear all that?

1318
01:22:39,373 --> 01:22:41,070
[noises continue]

1319
01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:42,202
-[gasps]
-[noises stop]

1320
01:22:42,202 --> 01:22:45,205
I also see it and feel it.

1321
01:22:45,205 --> 01:22:48,208
I am a transmitter. [chuckles]

1322
01:22:48,208 --> 01:22:49,949
Isn't it all too much?

1323
01:22:51,124 --> 01:22:52,429
I am a djinn.

1324
01:22:52,429 --> 01:22:53,604
I can adapt.

1325
01:22:55,519 --> 01:22:57,304
I'll soon get used to it.

1326
01:22:57,304 --> 01:22:59,175
[woman] She's back.

1327
01:22:59,175 --> 01:23:00,524
I believe she's back.

1328
01:23:00,524 --> 01:23:02,483
Is she with someone?

1329
01:23:02,483 --> 01:23:04,528
[woman] No, I think she's
talking to herself again.

1330
01:23:04,528 --> 01:23:06,269
[Alithea] Hello, Clementine.

1331
01:23:06,269 --> 01:23:08,619
Fanny. Are you well?

1332
01:23:08,619 --> 01:23:10,447
[Clementine]
Did you have any trouble?

1333
01:23:10,447 --> 01:23:12,623
Trouble? What kind of trouble?

1334
01:23:12,623 --> 01:23:14,451
With your foreign friends.

1335
01:23:14,451 --> 01:23:16,366
Because we often
ask ourselves,

1336
01:23:16,366 --> 01:23:19,065
"Why would Dr. Binnie waste
her time and intelligence

1337
01:23:19,065 --> 01:23:21,763
"studying the ways of others
instead of upholding our own?"

1338
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:24,287
Embarrassed by
our British culture, are we?

1339
01:23:24,287 --> 01:23:25,767
No. No.

1340
01:23:25,767 --> 01:23:28,161
I am rather more likely
to be embarrassed by anybody

1341
01:23:28,161 --> 01:23:30,511
reflexly frightened
of anybody different.

1342
01:23:30,511 --> 01:23:31,642
What exactly are you saying?

1343
01:23:31,642 --> 01:23:33,427
She's calling us bigots.

1344
01:23:33,427 --> 01:23:34,471
Your word, not mine.

1345
01:23:34,471 --> 01:23:35,603
[Clementine] You misunderstand.

1346
01:23:35,603 --> 01:23:37,126
-Oh?
-It's not how they look, dear.

1347
01:23:37,126 --> 01:23:38,649
It's how they live.
What they believe.

1348
01:23:38,649 --> 01:23:40,390
-What they eat.
-What are you on about?

1349
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:42,218
Everywhere one goes, ethnics.

1350
01:23:42,218 --> 01:23:45,221
We are being overwhelmed,
and we're inviting our doom.

1351
01:23:45,221 --> 01:23:46,570
[Fanny] It's not natural.

1352
01:23:46,570 --> 01:23:48,703
Birds belong in the air.
Fish belong in the sea.

1353
01:23:48,703 --> 01:23:51,010
And that is how the good Lord
meant us to be.

1354
01:23:51,010 --> 01:23:53,055
You're just spouting rubbish
from start to finish.

1355
01:23:53,055 --> 01:23:54,578
It's science.
It's a scientific fact.

1356
01:23:54,578 --> 01:23:55,840
-It's a false analogy.
-[voices echoing]

1357
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,104
I mean, animals do have
a natural habitat.

1358
01:23:58,104 --> 01:24:00,323
It's true,
but human beings are capable

1359
01:24:00,323 --> 01:24:02,456
of living in any environment
they bloody well choose.

1360
01:24:02,456 --> 01:24:03,674
-That's not a fact.
-[airplane engine humming]

1361
01:24:03,674 --> 01:24:05,328
-What are you saying?
-It's an opinion.

1362
01:24:05,328 --> 01:24:06,547
And you're wrong.

1363
01:24:06,547 --> 01:24:08,027
I'm not putting up
with any more of this.

1364
01:24:08,027 --> 01:24:10,246
Come away, Clem.
Let the crazy lady be.

1365
01:24:10,246 --> 01:24:12,161
We're never gonna get
any sense out of her.

1366
01:24:12,161 --> 01:24:14,424
[Alithea] You know, I've never
said this to you before.

1367
01:24:15,077 --> 01:24:17,514
But you're both pitiful.

1368
01:24:17,514 --> 01:24:18,733
Shut your cakehole! [echoing]

1369
01:24:18,733 --> 01:24:21,301
Pea-brained and pitiful.

1370
01:24:21,823 --> 01:24:24,217
You, fuckface!

1371
01:24:24,217 --> 01:24:28,221
Stop your ivy growing
on our side of the wall!

1372
01:24:29,309 --> 01:24:31,485
Why do I let them get to me?

1373
01:24:31,485 --> 01:24:33,574
I should feel sorry for them.

1374
01:24:33,574 --> 01:24:36,794
But this is my home.
It's my sanctuary.

1375
01:24:36,794 --> 01:24:38,405
[inhaler hisses]

1376
01:24:38,405 --> 01:24:40,842
[Clementine and Fanny's
voices echoing]

1377
01:24:40,842 --> 01:24:43,062
-I could wish them... [grunts]
-[static buzzes]

1378
01:24:44,106 --> 01:24:46,326
That's not a wish, by the way.

1379
01:24:46,326 --> 01:24:47,718
-I know.
-[exhales heavily]

1380
01:24:47,718 --> 01:24:50,199
[Clementine and Fanny's voices
continue echoing]

1381
01:24:50,199 --> 01:24:52,897
[people chattering indistinctly
from transmissions]

1382
01:24:56,684 --> 01:24:59,078
[Alithea breathing heavily]

1383
01:24:59,078 --> 01:25:01,123
[transmissions fading]

1384
01:25:05,432 --> 01:25:08,217
[sentimental string
music playing]

1385
01:25:59,268 --> 01:26:02,184
[sentimental string
music continues]

1386
01:26:51,364 --> 01:26:52,626
[Alithea whispers] My djinn.

1387
01:26:53,670 --> 01:26:54,889
[The Djinn] How was your day?

1388
01:26:54,889 --> 01:26:57,283
[Alithea] Every listening ear
was yours.

1389
01:26:57,283 --> 01:26:59,894
Every voice, every scent,
and touch.

1390
01:26:59,894 --> 01:27:01,635
You were everywhere.

1391
01:27:06,857 --> 01:27:08,555
Back in a minute.

1392
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:29,750
[Fanny] Whoever could that be
at this hour?

1393
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:30,838
[Clementine]
It could be her.

1394
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:37,236
Clem. Fanny.

1395
01:27:39,281 --> 01:27:41,762
Chickpeas, cloves, pistachio.

1396
01:27:43,590 --> 01:27:45,287
They melt in your mouth.

1397
01:28:03,305 --> 01:28:04,785
This is my friend.

1398
01:28:05,916 --> 01:28:07,831
He'll be staying for a while.

1399
01:28:08,745 --> 01:28:09,790
Hello.

1400
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,621
-Hello.
-Hello.

1401
01:28:18,886 --> 01:28:20,670
[Alithea] My Djinn told me,

1402
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:23,630
when they come together
in the Realm of Djinn,

1403
01:28:23,630 --> 01:28:25,414
they tell each other stories.

1404
01:28:26,589 --> 01:28:28,722
Stories are like
breath to them.

1405
01:28:28,722 --> 01:28:29,810
They make meaning.

1406
01:28:31,768 --> 01:28:33,030
"Yes," I said.

1407
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:34,815
"That's just how
it is with us."

1408
01:28:35,859 --> 01:28:37,600
Each story we tell
is a fragment

1409
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:40,037
in an endless
shape-shifting mosaic.

1410
01:28:41,604 --> 01:28:45,739
And this small pebble,
like all stories, must end.

1411
01:28:47,697 --> 01:28:50,874
If it's about wishing,
it's a cautionary tale.

1412
01:28:51,962 --> 01:28:54,965
So, how will it go wrong?

1413
01:28:54,965 --> 01:28:57,490
Perhaps, it already has.

1414
01:29:00,797 --> 01:29:03,322
Even though Truth
stood before them naked,

1415
01:29:03,322 --> 01:29:04,975
they turned their backs.

1416
01:29:04,975 --> 01:29:09,458
So, Truth moved to the side
and waited in the shadows.

1417
01:29:09,458 --> 01:29:11,112
In the days that followed,

1418
01:29:11,112 --> 01:29:14,637
the Djinn would accompany
the narratologist to her work.

1419
01:29:14,637 --> 01:29:16,247
And when he wasn't with her,

1420
01:29:16,247 --> 01:29:19,468
he would go in eager
exploration of the world.

1421
01:29:19,468 --> 01:29:22,428
[machine beeping]

1422
01:29:22,428 --> 01:29:25,344
[The Djinn] Today I had
such a marvelous day.

1423
01:29:26,649 --> 01:29:29,652
I saw many things.

1424
01:29:29,652 --> 01:29:33,830
I watched a human look into
the living brain of another

1425
01:29:33,830 --> 01:29:36,442
and arrest a fatal bleeding.

1426
01:29:40,924 --> 01:29:42,709
I visited the Collider.

1427
01:29:44,014 --> 01:29:48,454
A vast gizmo which probed
the essence of matter.

1428
01:29:51,587 --> 01:29:54,851
And then I saw a dish,
a great dish

1429
01:29:54,851 --> 01:29:58,551
that listens to the whispers
of stars long dead.

1430
01:30:00,683 --> 01:30:02,685
Humankind is...

1431
01:30:02,685 --> 01:30:04,600
is a wonder, Alithea.

1432
01:30:05,514 --> 01:30:07,951
I'm happy you think so.

1433
01:30:07,951 --> 01:30:11,041
All of this since I was
trapped in Zefir's bottle.

1434
01:30:11,041 --> 01:30:15,829
All these astonishments,
in less than 200 years.

1435
01:30:15,829 --> 01:30:17,831
Yes, but, I mean,

1436
01:30:17,831 --> 01:30:22,139
that's just engineering
and technology.

1437
01:30:22,139 --> 01:30:24,751
Despite all the whiz-bang,

1438
01:30:24,751 --> 01:30:26,883
we remain bewildered.

1439
01:30:29,799 --> 01:30:31,758
When we can't
contain the chaos,

1440
01:30:33,542 --> 01:30:36,153
we are filled
with dread and panic,

1441
01:30:36,153 --> 01:30:38,460
and we turn on each other.

1442
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:40,984
But of course, you are human.

1443
01:30:40,984 --> 01:30:43,117
That is your nature.

1444
01:30:45,467 --> 01:30:48,905
Yeah. So, the story
never changes.

1445
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:52,518
Hate prevails.

1446
01:30:52,518 --> 01:30:57,131
It metastasizes
and outlives love.

1447
01:30:58,915 --> 01:31:01,570
I just want
to talk about love.

1448
01:31:01,570 --> 01:31:05,618
Such a mess
of contradictions,
all of you.

1449
01:31:05,618 --> 01:31:06,749
Thank you very much.

1450
01:31:06,749 --> 01:31:10,057
Humankind,
what a conundrum.

1451
01:31:10,057 --> 01:31:12,799
You fumble around in the dark,

1452
01:31:12,799 --> 01:31:15,932
and yet, you herd your
intelligence to great effect.

1453
01:31:15,932 --> 01:31:17,586
It is quite a story.

1454
01:31:17,586 --> 01:31:18,848
[chuckles softly]

1455
01:31:18,848 --> 01:31:21,721
Cannot wait to see
where it goes.

1456
01:31:21,721 --> 01:31:23,636
Or how it might end.

1457
01:31:23,984 --> 01:31:25,725
That too.

1458
01:31:25,725 --> 01:31:29,685
A mortal will never know,
but a djinn might.

1459
01:31:29,685 --> 01:31:32,166
A djinn has all the time
in the world.

1460
01:31:34,255 --> 01:31:36,475
Aren't you the lucky one?

1461
01:31:36,475 --> 01:31:37,824
Maybe.

1462
01:31:38,825 --> 01:31:42,089
But you creatures
of dust have...

1463
01:31:42,089 --> 01:31:43,612
have managed to eclipse

1464
01:31:43,612 --> 01:31:46,963
the power and purpose
of djinn and angel.

1465
01:31:46,963 --> 01:31:49,183
You have no use for us.

1466
01:31:49,183 --> 01:31:50,576
Perhaps, we will wither and...

1467
01:31:50,576 --> 01:31:52,099
-And fade away?
-Yes.

1468
01:31:52,099 --> 01:31:54,536
Yeah. Well, that used
to be the subject

1469
01:31:54,536 --> 01:31:56,625
of all my lectures and papers.

1470
01:31:56,625 --> 01:31:57,931
I know.

1471
01:32:00,542 --> 01:32:02,283
And yet, here you are.

1472
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:06,069
My impossible.

1473
01:32:07,984 --> 01:32:09,072
Yes.

Hello?

I'm home!

1478
01:32:39,712 --> 01:32:41,017
Hello?

[switch clicks]

1480
01:33:07,043 --> 01:33:08,610

My love?

[Alithea gasps]

[switch clicks]

01:33:23,146 --> 01:33:24,321
What's this?

1486
01:33:26,933 --> 01:33:28,935
Can you hear me?

1487
01:33:28,935 --> 01:33:31,111
Djinn, speak to me.

1488
01:33:31,111 --> 01:33:32,678
Try to speak to me.

1489
01:33:34,636 --> 01:33:36,812
I wish you to speak to me.

[grunts] Sleeping.

1499

Djinn don't sleep.

1500
01:34:04,971 --> 01:34:06,276
[The Djinn] Let's go
for a walk.

1501
01:34:06,276 --> 01:34:07,756
A long, bracing walk.

1502
01:34:07,756 --> 01:34:09,323
I have prepared
something for us.

1503
01:34:09,323 --> 01:34:10,933
[in normal voice]
I have it all planned.

1504
01:34:10,933 --> 01:34:13,109
[breathlessly]
A wonderous night for us.

1505
01:34:13,109 --> 01:34:15,285
It will be amazing.

1506
01:34:15,285 --> 01:34:18,114
-The best time of our lives.
-Stop!

1507
01:34:18,114 --> 01:34:22,249
These electromagnetic fields,
I can push them from my head.

1508
01:34:22,249 --> 01:34:23,816
I can push them away.

1509
01:34:24,904 --> 01:34:26,122
We'll go for a picnic.

1510

[speaking Djinnbish]

1514
01:34:35,784 --> 01:34:39,092
Alithea, there is a place
for me here.

1515
01:34:39,092 --> 01:34:40,354
These forces,

1516
01:34:40,354 --> 01:34:42,051
they will never go away,
not from this world.

1517
01:34:42,051 --> 01:34:44,271
I will overcome them.
I can do that for you.

1518
01:34:44,271 --> 01:34:46,447
You are my Alithea,
and I love you.

1519

Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you for trying.

1520
01:34:48,231 --> 01:34:49,363
You don't think
that I love you?

1521
01:34:50,451 --> 01:34:52,671
Love is a gift.

1522
01:34:52,671 --> 01:34:55,064
It's a gift of oneself
given freely.

1523
01:34:55,064 --> 01:34:57,284
It's not something
one can ever ask for.

1524
01:34:58,807 --> 01:35:00,026
I tricked us both.

1525
01:35:00,026 --> 01:35:01,723
The moment I spoke that wish,

1526
01:35:01,723 --> 01:35:04,813
I took away
your power to grant it.

1527
01:35:04,813 --> 01:35:09,078
I, more than anybody,
I should've known that.

1528
01:35:09,078 --> 01:35:11,254
I'm not going
to screw this up again.

My Djinn, if this world
is not for you,

1530
01:35:15,432 --> 01:35:18,305
I wish that you return
to where you belong.

01:39:40,088 --> 01:39:42,699
[Alithea] He would visit
from time to time,

and they would grasp
each vivid moment.

of the raucous skies,

she begged him to leave.

He promised to return
in her lifetime,

and for her,
that was more than enough.
