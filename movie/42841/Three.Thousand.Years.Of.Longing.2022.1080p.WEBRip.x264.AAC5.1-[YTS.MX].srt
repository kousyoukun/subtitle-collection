3
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:06,078
You speak the Greek of Homer?

4
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,540
I took some classes...

5
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,291
at university.

6
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,128
Please do not fear me,

7
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:17,840
nor treat me casually.

8
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,967
I am beholden to you

9
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:21,969
for this release.

10
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:23,136
On that account,

11
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,930
I must grant you

12
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:28,141
three wishes.

13
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:29,726
There are laws

14
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:32,062
which cannot be broken.

15
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,314
Three is three.

16
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,899
A number of power.

17
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:38,402
You may not wish

18
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,821
for endless wishes.

19
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:44,199
Yes. I'm familiar
with the concept.

20
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,119
Nor may you wish
for eternal life.

21
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,413
It is your nature to be mortal.

22
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,707
Mine to be immortal.

23
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,421
Nor can I absolve sin

24
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,673
or end all suffering.

25
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,968
I am only a Djinn.

26
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,095
That's reasonable.

27
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,932
These are the limits.

28
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,066
What is this small human?

29
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,986
He is a...

30
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,157
Wizard.

31
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,618
Guiding us through time.

32
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:33,081
Are you a witch...

33
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,917
who has him in a box?

34
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,461
No. It is science.

35
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:46,094
Waves of...
light and sound.

36
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,643
I'm not sure how it works.

37
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,729
I am a literary scholar.

38
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,316
We don't know much.

39
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:01,905
You are Queen,
free as a mighty bird...

40
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,700
seeing all things
with an even eye.

41
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:08,996
Why would you bind yourself
to the bed of man?

42
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:10,622
Sweet cousin Djinn...

43
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:14,209
there is no man
who could so beguile me.

44
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:00,916
And who are you?

45
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:13,155
I made these for you.

46
00:38:12,918 --> 00:38:14,753
I wish to be pregnant.

47
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:16,213
With Mustafa?

48
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:17,381
Please no.

49
00:38:17,506 --> 00:38:19,591
It's my heart's desire.

50
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:21,593
Grant me my wish.

51
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:23,136
Now.

52
00:38:23,262 --> 00:38:24,513
Please wait.

53
00:40:55,706 --> 00:40:57,207
My Sultan.

54
00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:03,088
Father...

55
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:46,423
They are coming for you.

56
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:47,925
Make a wish!

57
00:41:48,509 --> 00:41:50,010
Just one more wish.

58
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:51,386
Why?

59
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:52,930
Gulten.

60
00:41:53,055 --> 00:41:55,224
They are coming to kill you!

61
00:41:57,184 --> 00:41:58,560
The Prince will protect me.

62
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:01,230
There is nothing he can do.
Make a wish!

63
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:03,482
He loves me.

64
00:42:03,607 --> 00:42:04,525
Gulten.

65
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:05,567
He is dead!

66
00:42:06,818 --> 00:42:07,861
He is dead!

67
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:10,864
All who cherish him are dead.

68
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:12,741
Hurrem is coming for you...

69
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:54,867
You are not wanted here.

70
00:42:59,037 --> 00:43:01,707
You cannot change her story.

71
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:07,546
If she does not wish...

72
00:43:08,797 --> 00:43:11,383
you are doomed.

73
00:51:21,456 --> 00:51:24,418
Why waste your sword, my Lion?

74
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,497
Big Brother...

75
00:52:11,465 --> 00:52:13,091
He's a baby.

76
00:52:14,426 --> 00:52:16,220
How could he ever rule?

77
00:57:32,035 --> 00:57:33,328
Mother!

78
00:57:34,246 --> 00:57:35,289
Mother!

79
00:58:40,771 --> 00:58:43,273
Please fine lady...
my situation is grave.

80
00:58:43,398 --> 00:58:45,526
It's desperate.
You must help me.

81
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:47,027
You smell.

82
00:58:47,152 --> 00:58:48,153
Wish.

83
00:58:48,654 --> 00:58:49,655
Wish for anything.

84
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:51,323
Wish for everything!

85
00:58:51,448 --> 00:58:54,034
I want nothing to do
with devious Djinn.

86
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:55,911
Anything you hanker for?

87
00:58:56,203 --> 00:58:58,038
There must be! Wish it!

88
00:58:58,163 --> 00:59:01,667
Speak it! Tell me! Now! Now!

89
01:06:55,933 --> 01:06:57,184
I want knowledge.

90
01:06:57,893 --> 01:06:59,311
I wish to acquire...

91
01:06:59,436 --> 01:07:00,938
all knowledge

92
01:07:01,063 --> 01:07:03,398
that is useful

93
01:07:04,024 --> 01:07:08,153
beautiful and true.

94
01:10:10,627 --> 01:10:12,713
Are you happy?
