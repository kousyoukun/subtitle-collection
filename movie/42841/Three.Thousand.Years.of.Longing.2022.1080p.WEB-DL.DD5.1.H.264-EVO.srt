1
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:37,119
<i>My name is Alithea.</i>

2
00:01:37,153 --> 00:01:39,754
<i>My story is true.</i>

3
00:01:39,788 --> 00:01:42,190
<i>You're more likely
to believe me, however,</i>

4
00:01:42,223 --> 00:01:44,559
<i>if I tell it
as a fairy tale.</i>

5
00:01:47,063 --> 00:01:49,698
<i>So, once upon a time,</i>

6
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:53,635
<i>when humans
hurtled across the sky
on metal wings,</i>

7
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:55,570
<i>when they wore
webbed feet</i>

8
00:01:55,603 --> 00:01:58,273
<i>and walked
on the bottom of the sea,</i>

9
00:01:59,407 --> 00:02:01,543
<i>when they held
in their hands glass tiles</i>

10
00:02:01,576 --> 00:02:04,080
<i>that could coax
love songs from the air...</i>

11
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,983
<i>...there was a woman,
adequately happy and alone.</i>

12
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:11,619
<i>Alone by choice.</i>

13
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:14,522
<i>Happy because
she was independent,</i>

14
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:17,792
<i>living off the exercise
of her scholarly mind.</i>

15
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:21,529
<i>Her business was story.</i>

16
00:02:22,864 --> 00:02:24,399
<i>She was
a narratologist</i>

17
00:02:24,432 --> 00:02:26,168
<i>who sought
to find the truths</i>

18
00:02:26,202 --> 00:02:29,304
<i>common to all the stories
of humankind.</i>

19
00:02:30,405 --> 00:02:33,241
<i>To this end,
once or twice a year,</i>

20
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:36,011
<i>she ventured
to strange lands.</i>

21
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:38,580
<i>To China,
the South Seas,</i>

22
00:02:38,613 --> 00:02:40,949
<i>and the timeless cities
of the Levant...</i>

23
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:49,524
<i>where her kind gathered
to tell stories about stories.</i>

24
00:02:52,027 --> 00:02:53,195
This way.

25
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:54,929
- Excuse me.
- This way, lady.

26
00:02:54,963 --> 00:02:56,998
What are you doing?
Can you let go, please?

27
00:02:57,032 --> 00:02:59,235
The mysteries of Istanbul.

28
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:03,471
Alithea!

29
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:05,040
Alithea!

30
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:11,479
Welcome!

31
00:03:11,513 --> 00:03:13,182
- Welcome at last! Aw.
- Gunhan!

32
00:03:13,215 --> 00:03:15,316
My dear friend.

33
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,951
- Oh, how wonderful!
- I'm sorry.

34
00:03:16,985 --> 00:03:18,486
- This is Amina.
- Amina.

35
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,421
From the British Council.

36
00:03:21,856 --> 00:03:24,626
That fellow at the airport
manhandling my luggage,

37
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:25,860
did you see him?

38
00:03:25,894 --> 00:03:27,029
What fellow?

39
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:30,799
He scuttled off
when you arrived.

40
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:36,038
Small, sheepskin jacket,
pink collar.

41
00:03:38,673 --> 00:03:39,774
Interesting.

42
00:03:40,809 --> 00:03:42,977
He was hot to touch.

43
00:03:44,146 --> 00:03:45,413
Musky.

44
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,448
Perhaps he was a djinn.

45
00:03:47,482 --> 00:03:50,119
An illegal taxi driver,
more likely.

46
00:03:50,152 --> 00:03:52,087
Wearing too much cologne.

47
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:53,755
So, Professor,

48
00:03:53,788 --> 00:03:56,091
you saying
you believe in djinn?

49
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:59,195
I believe there are those
who need to believe in them.

50
00:03:59,228 --> 00:04:00,361
Including me?

51
00:04:00,395 --> 00:04:01,896
Djinn, ghosts,

52
00:04:02,597 --> 00:04:04,699
aliens, whatever helps.

53
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:13,842
The hotel's arranged
a lovely surprise for you.

54
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:21,016
It's the Agatha Christie room.

55
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:21,950
In this room,

56
00:04:21,983 --> 00:04:24,919
she wrote
<i>Murder on the Orient Express.</i>

57
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:37,565
So,
how would you explain

58
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:40,135
the power
of a thunderstorm

59
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:41,337
if you don't have the means

60
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:43,972
to measure and model
meteorological data?

61
00:04:45,607 --> 00:04:47,742
How can you
explain the seasons?

62
00:04:47,775 --> 00:04:50,545
Autumn through winter
to spring and summer,

63
00:04:50,578 --> 00:04:52,714
if you don't know
that the Earth

64
00:04:52,747 --> 00:04:55,516
orbits the Sun
while tilted on an axis?

65
00:04:56,584 --> 00:04:58,620
Everything was mystery.

66
00:04:58,653 --> 00:05:03,691
The seasons, tsunamis,
microbial disease...

67
00:05:03,725 --> 00:05:07,795
What else could we do
but resort to stories?

68
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:11,033
As Dr. Binnie
has encouraged
us to understand,

69
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:12,934
stories were once
the only way

70
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:15,503
to make our bewildering
existence coherent.

71
00:05:15,536 --> 00:05:17,273
That's exactly right.

72
00:05:17,306 --> 00:05:20,175
We gave name
to the unknown forces

73
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:23,212
behind all wonder
and catastrophe,

74
00:05:23,245 --> 00:05:25,580
by telling each other...

75
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,853
By telling
each other stories.

76
00:05:31,886 --> 00:05:33,655
let me show you.

77
00:05:33,688 --> 00:05:38,227
We told tales of specific,
powerful, relatable gods

78
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,796
ever present in all cultures,
in all mythologies,

79
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:45,034
from the Greeks,
to the Romans, to the Norse,

80
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:46,701
and so on,
and so on.

81
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:50,239
The familiar descendant
of Zeus, Poseidon, Athena,

82
00:05:50,272 --> 00:05:52,640
Thor, the whole gang,

83
00:05:52,674 --> 00:05:55,277
find expression
even today.

84
00:05:56,811 --> 00:05:59,747
These are
their vestiges.

85
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:04,919
The question remains,
what is their purpose?

86
00:06:10,392 --> 00:06:12,460
What do we require
of them now?

87
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:17,665
There is mythos,
and there is science.

88
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:22,271
Oh. Sorry.

89
00:06:22,304 --> 00:06:26,574
Mythology is what
we knew back then.

90
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:29,711
Science is what
we know so far.

91
00:06:34,383 --> 00:06:36,718
Sooner or later,

92
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:39,554
our creation stories
are replaced

93
00:06:39,587 --> 00:06:41,622
by the narratives of science.

94
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,060
Painstaking science.

95
00:06:45,094 --> 00:06:46,995
And all gods and monsters

96
00:06:47,895 --> 00:06:50,165
outlive their original purpose

97
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:53,534
and are reduced
to metaphor.

98
00:06:53,568 --> 00:06:55,837
Rubbish!

99
00:06:58,573 --> 00:07:00,242
Alithea!

100
00:07:04,346 --> 00:07:05,613
Alithea.

101
00:07:06,514 --> 00:07:07,682
What happened?

102
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:09,284
I don't know.
She just fell.

103
00:07:09,318 --> 00:07:11,220
She just fell.

104
00:07:11,253 --> 00:07:13,222
Gosh.

105
00:07:20,162 --> 00:07:21,596
Are you okay?

106
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,475
Shouldn't
you see a doctor?

107
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:34,976
Why?
When I feel so well?

108
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,246
Forgive me, Alithea.
Are you sure?

109
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,680
Apart from
the usual aches and pains,

110
00:07:39,714 --> 00:07:41,383
there is nothing untoward.

111
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:43,085
There's no reason
to make a fuss.

112
00:07:43,118 --> 00:07:45,120
So, what happened
back there?

113
00:07:49,058 --> 00:07:53,095
Lately, my imagination's
been getting the better of me.

114
00:07:53,694 --> 00:07:55,663
Ambushing me.

115
00:07:55,696 --> 00:07:57,032
I think it's a warning.

116
00:07:57,066 --> 00:07:58,267
About what?

117
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:01,569
Not to be complacent.

118
00:08:01,602 --> 00:08:03,905
To keep on my toes.

119
00:08:03,938 --> 00:08:06,574
It manifests rudely
from time to time.

120
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:09,111
I try not to fight it off.

121
00:08:09,144 --> 00:08:13,148
It takes charge for a moment,
and then it steps back.

122
00:08:13,182 --> 00:08:14,516
What steps back?

123
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,752
Oh, Gunhan,
it's irrational.
Pay it no mind.

124
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:22,458
You are behaving like
a child. Do you know that?

125
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:24,126
You know,
I am actually a child.

126
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,266
<i>If there is fate,
can we escape it?</i>

127
00:08:32,034 --> 00:08:33,302
<i>Who can say?</i>

128
00:08:33,835 --> 00:08:35,970
<i>But I tell you this,</i>

129
00:08:36,004 --> 00:08:38,173
<i>in the Grand Bazaar
of Istanbul,</i>

130
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:43,078
<i>there are 62 streets
and 4,000 shops.</i>

131
00:08:43,112 --> 00:08:46,381
<i>And in one of those shops,
there are three rooms.</i>

132
00:08:47,516 --> 00:08:49,151
<i>In the smallest
of those rooms,</i>

133
00:08:49,184 --> 00:08:51,986
<i>there was a pile
of things unsorted,</i>

134
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,654
<i>old and new.</i>

135
00:08:54,523 --> 00:08:56,657
<i>From the bottom of that pile,</i>

136
00:08:57,493 --> 00:08:59,228
<i>I chose a memento.</i>

137
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:06,767
Do you know what this is?

138
00:09:06,801 --> 00:09:09,670
I'm not sure,
but it could be Cesm-i Bulbul,

139
00:09:09,704 --> 00:09:11,140
a "Nightingale's Eye."

140
00:09:11,173 --> 00:09:14,343
Around 1845, there were
these glassmakers in Incirkoy.

141
00:09:14,376 --> 00:09:17,346
They were famous for this
spiral blue-white pattern.

142
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:19,381
Oh, please.
It's a gift from me.

143
00:09:19,414 --> 00:09:21,216
Choose something less forlorn.

144
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,257
And, uh, if this
is Cesm-i Bulbul,

145
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,791
uh, is there a way
of authenticating it?

146
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:32,528
Well, they say
that if it is genuine,

147
00:09:32,561 --> 00:09:34,563
sometimes you can see
specks of blood

148
00:09:34,596 --> 00:09:35,997
from the lungs
of the glassblowers.

149
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:39,201
But this is more likely
a recent imitation.

150
00:09:39,234 --> 00:09:42,104
It's been damaged by fire.
Pick something else.

151
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,406
No, thank you, Gunhan.

152
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,674
I like it.

153
00:09:46,707 --> 00:09:49,677
Whatever it is, I'm sure
it has an interesting story.

154
00:10:16,238 --> 00:10:17,072
Hello?

155
00:10:17,105 --> 00:10:18,140
<i>Good morning, Dr. Binnie.</i>

156
00:10:18,173 --> 00:10:19,874
- Good morning.
<i>- This is room service.</i>

157
00:10:19,907 --> 00:10:21,276
- Yes.
<i>- How do you like your eggs?</i>

158
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,644
Er, runny, please.

159
00:10:22,678 --> 00:10:25,013
<i>- And with toast?</i>
- Yes, but no crusts.

160
00:10:25,047 --> 00:10:27,182
<i>- Two eggs?</i>
- Just one.

161
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:29,117
<i>- Okay, thank you.</i>
- Thank you.

162
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,910
I'm going to close my eyes
and count to three,

163
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,446
after which
I would be grateful

164
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,913
if you would be gone.

165
00:12:09,217 --> 00:12:10,719
One,

166
00:12:10,752 --> 00:12:12,120
two,

167
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,289
three.

168
00:12:18,826 --> 00:12:20,595
Four,

169
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:21,929
five,

170
00:12:23,065 --> 00:12:24,466
six,

171
00:12:24,499 --> 00:12:26,535
seven, eight,

172
00:12:26,568 --> 00:12:28,103
nine, ten.

173
00:12:49,157 --> 00:12:51,560
I don't suppose
you speak English?

174
00:12:53,228 --> 00:12:54,329
<i>Deutsch?</i>

175
00:12:55,364 --> 00:12:56,631
<i>Espanol?</i>

176
00:12:57,566 --> 00:12:58,600
<i>Ellinika?</i>

177
00:14:28,924 --> 00:14:29,957
Einstein.

178
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,326
Einstein.

179
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:41,470
Television.

180
00:14:48,176 --> 00:14:49,811
Transmitters.

181
00:14:59,387 --> 00:15:01,256
I am a djinn
of modest power,

182
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:05,894
but I begin to understand
these transmissions.

183
00:15:05,927 --> 00:15:07,229
Oh!

184
00:15:07,262 --> 00:15:09,764
You've learned
to speak my language.

185
00:15:09,798 --> 00:15:12,767
This English
is straightforward.

186
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:15,103
Its rules quickly learn,
I find.

187
00:15:20,175 --> 00:15:21,409
<i>Nein, nein, nein.</i>

188
00:15:21,443 --> 00:15:22,944
Would you like this
little Albert for yourself?

189
00:15:22,978 --> 00:15:24,279
No, no, no.

190
00:15:24,312 --> 00:15:25,847
That can't be good for him.
Put him back.

191
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:27,115
- I could expand him.
- How?

192
00:15:27,148 --> 00:15:28,250
We could speak with him.

193
00:15:28,283 --> 00:15:29,651
- How is this possible?
- No, put him back.

194
00:15:29,684 --> 00:15:31,786
- Is that your wish?
- This is not possible.

195
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,655
No. It's your obligation.

196
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:41,463
So, what will you wish for?

197
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:45,100
What is your heart's desire?

198
00:15:50,171 --> 00:15:54,976
Now, let's, uh,
not get ahead of ourselves.

199
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:57,979
I need to take this slow.

200
00:15:58,014 --> 00:16:01,316
I have all the time
in the world.

201
00:16:01,349 --> 00:16:03,618
Tell me about yourself.

202
00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:05,420
My name is Alithea Binnie.

203
00:16:05,453 --> 00:16:07,923
I am in Turkey
for a conference.

204
00:16:07,956 --> 00:16:10,559
And I return to my homeland
in a day's time.

205
00:16:10,592 --> 00:16:11,760
Also?

206
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:18,199
Also, I have
a confession to make.

207
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:20,268
Something
I've never told anybody.

208
00:16:20,302 --> 00:16:21,703
Excellent.

209
00:16:22,938 --> 00:16:25,874
When I was young,
there was a boy.

210
00:16:25,907 --> 00:16:27,208
Your first lover?

211
00:16:27,242 --> 00:16:30,345
No, no, no.
He was not of flesh and blood.

212
00:16:30,378 --> 00:16:31,613
A djinn?

213
00:16:31,646 --> 00:16:33,515
No.

214
00:16:33,548 --> 00:16:37,586
At that time, I found myself
in a school for girls.

215
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:39,321
<i>Gaggles of girls.</i>

216
00:16:39,354 --> 00:16:44,159
<i>I was... Well, I am
a solitary creature by nature.</i>

217
00:16:44,192 --> 00:16:47,195
<i>And this boy, Enzo,</i>

218
00:16:47,228 --> 00:16:50,298
<i>he came to me,
out of an emptiness.</i>

219
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:54,336
<i>Out of a need to imagine.</i>

220
00:16:54,369 --> 00:16:56,271
He told me stories
in a language

221
00:16:56,304 --> 00:16:58,673
that only we two spoke.

222
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:02,210
And he always disappeared
when I had a headache,

223
00:17:02,243 --> 00:17:03,478
but he was never far away

224
00:17:03,511 --> 00:17:05,747
when I couldn't move
for asthma.

225
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,849
<i>He was like
this little Albert</i>

226
00:17:07,882 --> 00:17:09,484
<i>you would not let me give you?</i>

227
00:17:09,517 --> 00:17:11,186
<i>An emanation?</i>

228
00:17:11,219 --> 00:17:14,122
<i>Only an emanation
of an absence.</i>

229
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:20,562
<i>I feared he would leave,
and so I wrote him down.</i>

230
00:17:22,464 --> 00:17:27,235
<i>And I filled this journal,
bulging with facts.</i>

231
00:17:28,503 --> 00:17:32,841
But the more realism
I tried to insert,

232
00:17:32,874 --> 00:17:35,644
the more I began to doubt,

233
00:17:35,677 --> 00:17:38,880
and, uh, it all began
to feel silly.

234
00:17:40,116 --> 00:17:41,783
I felt silly.

235
00:17:43,685 --> 00:17:46,122
So, after a time,

236
00:17:46,154 --> 00:17:48,623
I burned it all
in the school furnace.

237
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:53,628
And after that,
he disappeared altogether.

238
00:17:54,963 --> 00:17:57,499
And yet, I am here.

239
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:01,770
Contrary to reason, yes.

240
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:07,009
I am here,
and we have work to do.

241
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,646
Can you come back
later, please?

242
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,815
It's room service,
Dr. Binnie.

243
00:18:13,848 --> 00:18:15,850
I have your breakfast.

244
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:17,419
Just a minute!

245
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,221
Must close door.

246
00:18:34,302 --> 00:18:35,403
Good morning.

247
00:18:35,437 --> 00:18:36,805
Where would you like it,
Dr. Binnie?

248
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:37,772
Thank you. Oh, I can take it.

249
00:18:37,806 --> 00:18:40,009
- Please, allow me.
- No. No, I can manage it.

250
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:42,977
Jolly good, Dr. Binnie.
I hope you are well rested.

251
00:18:43,012 --> 00:18:44,546
Oh, that looks delicious.
Yes, I am.

252
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:46,347
What do you plan to do
on this fine day?

253
00:18:46,381 --> 00:18:48,883
Uh, I'm not sure.
I'm improvising.

254
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:51,786
Well, I'd like to show you
a beautiful art gallery...

255
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,721
That's so kind. Thank you.

256
00:18:52,754 --> 00:18:54,023
...this afternoon,
when you get a chance.

257
00:18:54,056 --> 00:18:55,323
- Maybe another time.
- It will be great.

258
00:18:55,356 --> 00:18:56,391
Thank you.
Have a beautiful day.

259
00:18:56,424 --> 00:18:58,727
Okay. Jolly good. Enjoy.

260
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,928
Thank you!

261
00:19:39,201 --> 00:19:41,936
A more convenient size, I see.

262
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,838
I do what I can to fit in.

263
00:19:44,206 --> 00:19:46,108
Please.

264
00:19:46,142 --> 00:19:48,309
I needn't have
ordered breakfast.

265
00:19:48,343 --> 00:19:51,946
It's nan-e nokhodchi.
Chickpeas, cloves, pistachio.

266
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,715
It will melt in your mouth.

267
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,889
May I ask you something?

268
00:20:00,922 --> 00:20:01,990
Anything.

269
00:20:03,324 --> 00:20:06,262
How come you found your way
into my bottle?

270
00:20:07,395 --> 00:20:08,897
Ah, it's quite a story.

271
00:20:09,697 --> 00:20:11,733
That was
my third incarceration.

272
00:20:11,766 --> 00:20:13,835
You've been trapped
in a bottle three times?

273
00:20:13,868 --> 00:20:16,005
I may be a djinn,
but I'm also a fool

274
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:18,807
with too great a fondness
for the conversation of women.

275
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,177
I need to be more careful
in the future.

276
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,744
How were you caught
in the first place?

277
00:20:23,678 --> 00:20:25,147
By desire.

278
00:20:25,181 --> 00:20:26,948
How else?

279
00:20:29,918 --> 00:20:31,519
Who was she?

280
00:20:31,553 --> 00:20:32,954
Sheba.

281
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:34,156
The Queen of Sheba?

282
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,890
She was my kin.

283
00:20:35,924 --> 00:20:37,026
She was a djinn?

284
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:38,359
Her mother was a djinn.

285
00:20:38,393 --> 00:20:39,460
Is that possible?

286
00:20:39,494 --> 00:20:40,628
There are laws that allow

287
00:20:40,662 --> 00:20:42,164
the union
of djinn and mortals,

288
00:20:42,198 --> 00:20:44,099
but they cannot produce
an immortal scion

289
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:45,234
the way a donkey and a horse

290
00:20:45,267 --> 00:20:47,368
can only produce
a seedless mule.

291
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:51,940
So, what did she look like?

292
00:20:51,973 --> 00:20:56,178
Other than a thick glade
of black hair on her legs,

293
00:20:56,212 --> 00:20:57,579
she looked like
any other human being,

294
00:20:57,612 --> 00:20:59,881
except, of course,
she was Sheba.

295
00:20:59,914 --> 00:21:02,517
By all accounts,
she was very beautiful.

296
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,620
She was not beautiful.
She was beauty itself.

297
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:11,793
I was in every way free.

298
00:21:11,826 --> 00:21:14,963
I would come in and out
of her sleeping chamber.

299
00:21:16,165 --> 00:21:18,633
Sheba...

300
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,873
<i>I knew as well as any
of her female slaves</i>

301
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:28,010
<i>the touches that made
her shiver with bliss.</i>

302
00:21:29,211 --> 00:21:31,679
<i>Never have I wanted
a creature so.</i>

303
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,815
And she desired you in return?

304
00:21:33,848 --> 00:21:37,219
I was her plaything.
Her confidante.

305
00:21:37,253 --> 00:21:39,487
I might have become more,
but for Solomon.

306
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,889
King Solomon?

307
00:21:40,922 --> 00:21:42,690
Blessed be his memory.

308
00:21:42,724 --> 00:21:45,160
He came from across
the deserts to woo her.

309
00:21:45,194 --> 00:21:46,295
Didn't she go to him?

310
00:21:46,328 --> 00:21:47,629
No. Never.

311
00:21:47,662 --> 00:21:49,464
But it's in
all the holy books.

312
00:21:49,497 --> 00:21:51,133
All the stories
and the paintings.

313
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,934
And Handel wrote music
about it.

314
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:54,336
Madam, I was there.

315
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,205
Solomon came to her.

316
00:22:23,464 --> 00:22:25,533
<i>he began with music.</i>

317
00:23:57,026 --> 00:24:00,429
I did all that I could
to dissuade her.

318
00:24:00,462 --> 00:24:01,562
But when she used

319
00:24:01,596 --> 00:24:03,432
the scented wax
of the Jabassa Bee

320
00:24:03,465 --> 00:24:05,167
to remove the hair
from her legs,

321
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,701
<i>I knew that I was lost.</i>

322
00:24:06,734 --> 00:24:09,038
<i>But I, like a fool,
went on telling her</i>

323
00:24:09,071 --> 00:24:12,007
<i>that her body
was rich and lovely,</i>

324
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:14,709
<i>but her mind
was richer and lovelier,</i>

325
00:24:14,742 --> 00:24:16,478
<i>and more durable.</i>

326
00:24:16,512 --> 00:24:18,579
<i>And she agreed
with all that I said,</i>

327
00:24:18,613 --> 00:24:20,315
<i>and dropped a hot tear.</i>

328
00:24:21,616 --> 00:24:24,585
She began to set him tasks,
which seemed impossible,

329
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:26,687
to find a particular thread
of red silk

330
00:24:26,721 --> 00:24:28,689
in the palace
of a thousand rooms,

331
00:24:28,723 --> 00:24:31,592
to guess the secret name
of her mother djinn,

332
00:24:31,626 --> 00:24:34,862
to tell her
what women most desire.

333
00:24:34,896 --> 00:24:36,964
That does seem impossible.

334
00:24:36,998 --> 00:24:37,932
Not for him.

335
00:24:37,965 --> 00:24:39,567
He could speak
to the beasts of the earth,

336
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,969
and to the djinn
made of subtle fire.

337
00:24:42,004 --> 00:24:45,040
<i>He found ants to discover
the thread of silk,</i>

338
00:24:45,074 --> 00:24:47,342
<i>and an ifrit to whisper
the mother's name.</i>

339
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:53,981
<i>Then he looked
into her eyes</i>

340
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:57,052
<i>and told her
what women most desire.</i>

341
00:24:59,388 --> 00:25:00,922
<i>She was astonished,</i>

342
00:25:02,357 --> 00:25:04,093
<i>and told him he was right.</i>

343
00:25:08,297 --> 00:25:11,999
<i>And so she granted him
what he most desired,</i>

344
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:15,037
<i>which was to wed her
and be taken to her bed.</i>

345
00:25:35,023 --> 00:25:36,757
<i>He was a great magician...</i>

346
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:38,227
<i>...and imprisoned me</i>

347
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:41,662
<i>with a word of power
into a brass bottle.</i>

348
00:26:07,655 --> 00:26:09,924
<i>She made no plea for me.</i>

349
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:13,328
<i>I was nothing to her.</i>

350
00:26:13,362 --> 00:26:15,230
<i>A breath in a bottle.</i>

351
00:26:29,844 --> 00:26:32,614
<i>And so, I was cast
into the Red Sea</i>

352
00:26:32,648 --> 00:26:36,351
<i>and languished
for 2,500 years.</i>

353
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,158
Apart from sleep,

354
00:26:43,192 --> 00:26:46,295
what does one do in a bottle
for 2,500 years?

355
00:26:47,695 --> 00:26:49,331
Djinn don't sleep.

356
00:26:54,869 --> 00:26:56,737
So, how do you manage then?

357
00:26:59,907 --> 00:27:04,613
Well, for the first 100 years,
I rage against my fate.

358
00:27:04,646 --> 00:27:06,515
I pray to Boschkolo
for my release,

359
00:27:06,548 --> 00:27:07,782
and when that does not work,

360
00:27:07,815 --> 00:27:09,251
I pray to any god I know,

361
00:27:09,284 --> 00:27:11,420
and then to any god
I may not know.

362
00:27:11,453 --> 00:27:14,122
And when, still,
I find no answers,

363
00:27:15,023 --> 00:27:17,092
I spend my time
in waking dreams

364
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:19,927
revisiting all the stories
of my life.

365
00:27:19,961 --> 00:27:22,830
And when I have exhausted this
many, many times,

366
00:27:22,863 --> 00:27:25,866
I return to my prayer
and my rage.

367
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,004
And then, finally,

368
00:27:30,405 --> 00:27:32,474
I play a trick on myself.

369
00:27:33,808 --> 00:27:35,244
I pray to remain
in the bottle.

370
00:27:35,277 --> 00:27:39,248
I beseech Boschkolo to keep me
always in the bottle.

371
00:27:39,281 --> 00:27:40,649
And does that work?

372
00:27:40,682 --> 00:27:42,117
To yearn for nothing?

373
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,985
To pretend to want
nothing more

374
00:27:44,019 --> 00:27:45,953
than to be contained
in a bottle?

375
00:27:45,987 --> 00:27:47,189
No.

376
00:27:47,222 --> 00:27:50,092
For a djinn, it is the closest
we ever come to death.

377
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,596
Do you know the answer
to her question?

378
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,997
What women most desire?

379
00:27:56,031 --> 00:27:57,099
Yeah.

380
00:27:57,132 --> 00:27:58,634
Do you not know?

381
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:00,168
If you do not know,
I cannot tell you.

382
00:28:00,202 --> 00:28:02,337
Well, surely, we don't
all want the same thing.

383
00:28:02,371 --> 00:28:05,973
Madam, your yearnings
are not at all clear to me.

384
00:28:06,008 --> 00:28:09,278
I... I'm at a point in my life
where I have all I need.

385
00:28:09,311 --> 00:28:12,047
I daresay I'm content,
and gratefully so.

386
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,980
Tell me.

387
00:28:13,015 --> 00:28:15,550
Are you a wife? A widow?

388
00:28:15,584 --> 00:28:17,419
- Um...
- A mother, perhaps?

389
00:28:17,452 --> 00:28:20,289
I have no children,
no siblings, no parents.

390
00:28:21,989 --> 00:28:23,425
I did once have a husband.

391
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:24,393
Ah.

392
00:28:24,426 --> 00:28:26,827
And what was the complexion
of this husband?

393
00:28:27,396 --> 00:28:28,630
His complexion?

394
00:28:28,664 --> 00:28:31,832
In the beginning,
it was glowing.

395
00:28:31,866 --> 00:28:33,635
And in the ending?

396
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:35,170
It's not much of a story.

397
00:28:35,203 --> 00:28:38,273
But it is a story.
It is your story,

398
00:28:38,307 --> 00:28:39,741
and it is always wise

399
00:28:39,775 --> 00:28:41,677
to understand those
who have a hold on you.

400
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,778
Please.

401
00:28:45,013 --> 00:28:47,316
Well, okay, um...

402
00:28:49,685 --> 00:28:52,354
We'd known each other
since our youth.

403
00:28:52,387 --> 00:28:54,022
<i>We, uh, married early.</i>

404
00:28:54,056 --> 00:28:55,956
<i>In the beginning,
we took pleasure</i>

405
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,825
<i>in each other's minds
and bodies.</i>

406
00:28:57,858 --> 00:28:59,127
<i>Um...</i>

407
00:28:59,161 --> 00:29:00,961
<i>We passed
the years comfortably,</i>

408
00:29:00,995 --> 00:29:03,532
<i>and then as it happens,</i>

409
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:06,134
<i>it all evaporated,</i>

410
00:29:06,168 --> 00:29:08,337
<i>and, uh... and we became</i>

411
00:29:09,538 --> 00:29:10,572
less.

412
00:29:10,605 --> 00:29:11,606
And where is he?

413
00:29:13,108 --> 00:29:16,244
He's in Hackney,
with Emmeline Porter.

414
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:17,379
Mmm.

415
00:29:23,618 --> 00:29:25,320
<i>He told me I...</i>

416
00:29:25,354 --> 00:29:27,823
<i>I was incapable
of reading feelings.</i>

417
00:29:31,992 --> 00:29:34,329
<i>I was incapable
of reading his feelings.</i>

418
00:29:34,363 --> 00:29:36,431
...gonna have
a resolution.

419
00:29:36,465 --> 00:29:37,366
This is exciting!

420
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:38,966
- It is exciting!
- No, it's not.

421
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:40,602
Let me guess.
No one dies in it.

422
00:29:40,635 --> 00:29:42,137
No!

423
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:45,973
<i>The way my brain
is wired is... is the...</i>

424
00:29:46,007 --> 00:29:48,976
the source both of my power

425
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:51,912
and, uh, and my solitude.

426
00:29:52,748 --> 00:29:55,050
I suspect that's why
I like stories.

427
00:29:55,851 --> 00:29:58,653
I find feelings
through stories.

428
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:04,992
Perhaps you could
wish for him back.

429
00:30:05,026 --> 00:30:07,295
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no.

430
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:08,530
No.

431
00:30:09,698 --> 00:30:12,300
I... I thought, um,

432
00:30:13,268 --> 00:30:17,205
I might grieve
a loss and betrayal, but, uh,

433
00:30:18,573 --> 00:30:20,208
no, in fact, I was free.

434
00:30:21,676 --> 00:30:23,812
I was like a prisoner

435
00:30:23,845 --> 00:30:27,416
emerging from a dungeon
into the sunlight.

436
00:30:27,449 --> 00:30:30,252
I expanded into the space
of my own life.

437
00:30:30,285 --> 00:30:34,389
No, I could not wish for more.

438
00:30:34,423 --> 00:30:37,626
You are a wise
and cautious woman, Alithea.

439
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:40,095
But we all have desires,

440
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,130
even if they remain
hidden from us.

441
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:45,901
That's as maybe.

442
00:30:45,933 --> 00:30:50,839
But I am also
a narratologist,

443
00:30:50,872 --> 00:30:53,308
and that is going
to be a problem.

444
00:30:53,341 --> 00:30:55,744
It's going to be
a very big problem.

445
00:30:55,777 --> 00:30:57,779
See, I know
all the stories there are

446
00:30:57,813 --> 00:30:59,014
about trickster djinn,

447
00:30:59,047 --> 00:31:00,649
and the ways in which
they manipulate wishing

448
00:31:00,682 --> 00:31:01,716
to their own ends.

449
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,851
I am not one of them.

450
00:31:02,884 --> 00:31:04,586
I am god-fearing
and honorable,

451
00:31:04,619 --> 00:31:07,055
and only here
to grant your heart's desire.

452
00:31:07,088 --> 00:31:09,157
Well, even if that's true,

453
00:31:09,191 --> 00:31:12,461
how can you rely on those
called upon to wish?

454
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:17,299
How do you know
you can rely on me?

455
00:31:18,533 --> 00:31:20,335
Well, I hope so.

456
00:31:20,368 --> 00:31:23,371
With you,
I certainly hope so.

457
00:31:23,405 --> 00:31:25,373
There's a...

458
00:31:25,407 --> 00:31:28,310
funny little story.
I mean, you probably know it.

459
00:31:28,343 --> 00:31:30,245
Three friends lost at sea
in a tiny boat.

460
00:31:30,278 --> 00:31:32,013
They pull up a magic fish,

461
00:31:32,047 --> 00:31:33,748
who grants each of them
one wish.

462
00:31:33,782 --> 00:31:34,816
The first one,

463
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,651
"I wish I were at home
with my wife."

464
00:31:36,685 --> 00:31:37,552
He vanishes.

465
00:31:37,586 --> 00:31:39,254
The second one,
"I wish I were playing

466
00:31:39,287 --> 00:31:40,755
"in the fields
with my children."

467
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:41,890
Off he goes.

468
00:31:41,923 --> 00:31:44,493
And the third one,
"I miss my friends..."

469
00:31:44,526 --> 00:31:45,560
"I wish they were here."

470
00:31:45,594 --> 00:31:46,828
You've got it.

471
00:31:46,862 --> 00:31:50,465
There's no story about wishing
that is not a cautionary tale.

472
00:31:50,499 --> 00:31:52,200
None end happily.

473
00:31:52,234 --> 00:31:54,102
Not even the ones
that are supposed to be jokes.

474
00:31:54,135 --> 00:31:56,605
But you and I
are the authors of this story,

475
00:31:56,638 --> 00:31:59,107
and we can avoid all traps.

476
00:32:00,842 --> 00:32:03,211
Well, what if
I made no wish at all?

477
00:32:05,013 --> 00:32:06,214
Pardon?

478
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,752
What if I made no wish?

479
00:32:10,785 --> 00:32:11,953
That would be an...

480
00:32:14,489 --> 00:32:15,690
That would be

481
00:32:15,724 --> 00:32:17,959
catastrophic!

482
00:32:32,008 --> 00:32:33,542
All right.

483
00:32:38,213 --> 00:32:41,416
I need to tell you
about my next incarceration.

484
00:32:41,449 --> 00:32:42,450
I'm all ears.

485
00:32:53,428 --> 00:32:55,130
<i>I will never know</i>

486
00:32:55,163 --> 00:32:59,035
<i>how my bottle came from the
bottom of the Red Sea...</i>

487
00:33:00,135 --> 00:33:02,604
<i>...to a palace
in Constantinople.</i>

488
00:33:03,605 --> 00:33:05,507
<i>But I fancy
somehow it involved</i>

489
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,142
<i>the killing of
an Ottoman warrior.</i>

490
00:33:13,148 --> 00:33:14,783
<i>The fall of an empire.</i>

491
00:33:24,092 --> 00:33:25,293
<i>And a girl in love.</i>

492
00:33:47,016 --> 00:33:48,483
<i>Merhaba.</i>

493
00:34:10,106 --> 00:34:12,574
<i>Gulten lived as a slave</i>

494
00:34:12,607 --> 00:34:14,643
<i>in the courtyard
of the concubines</i>

495
00:34:14,676 --> 00:34:15,777
<i>in the seraglio.</i>

496
00:34:35,196 --> 00:34:36,531
<i>When I appeared to her...</i>

497
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:41,302
<i>...she fainted.</i>

498
00:34:41,336 --> 00:34:44,040
<i>And I had great trouble
rousing her.</i>

499
00:34:50,211 --> 00:34:52,681
I made it clear
that I meant her no harm,

500
00:34:52,714 --> 00:34:54,516
for I was condemned
to the bottle.

501
00:34:54,549 --> 00:34:56,085
Until you got
your three wishes.

502
00:34:56,118 --> 00:34:58,054
Until she got hers.

503
00:34:58,087 --> 00:35:00,221
- Please.
- Okay.

504
00:35:00,255 --> 00:35:01,690
Now, the poor girl told me

505
00:35:01,723 --> 00:35:05,827
she was distractedly in love
with a beautiful man...

506
00:35:07,163 --> 00:35:08,797
<i>...and she wished immediately</i>

507
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,033
<i>to find favor in his eyes.</i>

508
00:35:24,046 --> 00:35:25,380
<i>As it happens,</i>

509
00:35:25,413 --> 00:35:27,982
<i>the one she most desired
was the splendid Mustafa.</i>

510
00:35:28,017 --> 00:35:29,751
<i>Prince Mustafa.</i>

511
00:35:31,586 --> 00:35:34,255
<i>Eldest son of
Suleiman the Magnificent,</i>

512
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:37,459
<i>and likely heir
to his mighty throne.</i>

513
00:35:38,426 --> 00:35:39,994
<i>Had I known what was to come,</i>

514
00:35:40,029 --> 00:35:43,132
I would've risked
the furies of Iblis

515
00:35:43,165 --> 00:35:46,434
to vehemently distract her
from her wish.

516
00:35:47,902 --> 00:35:49,337
<i>But without thinking,</i>

517
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:52,108
<i>I took my bottle
and conjured oils</i>

518
00:35:52,141 --> 00:35:53,708
<i>to prepare her.</i>

519
00:35:55,343 --> 00:35:57,046
<i>Oils of enchantment</i>

520
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:00,248
<i>once used only by Sheba.</i>

521
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:06,821
<i>I cautioned her
to hide the bottle</i>

522
00:36:06,855 --> 00:36:09,858
<i>lest its powers
fall into other hands.</i>

523
00:36:15,164 --> 00:36:16,765
<i>I went to Mustafa.</i>

524
00:36:16,798 --> 00:36:18,500
Gulten.

525
00:36:18,533 --> 00:36:19,968
<i>I whispered her name.</i>

526
00:36:24,706 --> 00:36:26,374
<i>He sent for her.</i>

527
00:36:28,843 --> 00:36:30,578
<i>It was so easy.</i>

528
00:36:39,221 --> 00:36:41,389
<i>As a djinn,
I am endlessly curious</i>

529
00:36:41,422 --> 00:36:43,358
<i>about the ways of humans.</i>

530
00:36:44,226 --> 00:36:45,627
<i>So, in my spare time,</i>

531
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:49,531
<i>I took to wandering the palace
in search of its intrigues.</i>

532
00:36:50,298 --> 00:36:51,766
<i>And there, among the eunuchs,</i>

533
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,535
<i>the consorts,
and the concubines,</i>

534
00:36:53,568 --> 00:36:55,804
<i>I first saw Hurrem.</i>

535
00:36:56,838 --> 00:36:58,174
<i>The Laughing One.</i>

536
00:37:06,748 --> 00:37:08,716
<i>She, too, was a slave</i>

537
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,452
<i>who had risen
through the center of them all</i>

538
00:37:11,486 --> 00:37:13,888
<i>to become
the Sultan's favorite.</i>

539
00:37:22,397 --> 00:37:26,135
<i>Suleiman the Wise
saw none but her.</i>

540
00:37:26,168 --> 00:37:28,670
<i>And she sought
to protect his throne</i>

541
00:37:28,703 --> 00:37:32,941
<i>in favor of her own sons
over his beloved Mustafa.</i>

542
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:38,080
<i>And to this end,
she had the prince watched</i>

543
00:37:38,113 --> 00:37:39,814
<i>by many probing eyes.</i>

544
00:37:49,991 --> 00:37:51,359
<i>When I saw how Hurrem</i>

545
00:37:51,392 --> 00:37:55,197
<i>made a masterpiece
of her manipulations,</i>

546
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:59,367
<i>I worried that my Gulten
might be caught in this web.</i>

547
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,375
<i>I tried to warn her
to be careful.</i>

548
00:38:09,111 --> 00:38:12,847
<i>But she had already
decided on her second wish.</i>

549
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,662
<i>Such a mistake.</i>

550
00:38:28,563 --> 00:38:30,632
<i>Because at this moment,</i>

551
00:38:30,665 --> 00:38:33,068
<i>Suleiman, blessed be his name,</i>

552
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,802
<i>is being undermined.</i>

553
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,539
<i>His warriors believe
he is going soft,</i>

554
00:38:38,573 --> 00:38:41,277
<i>more interested in his poetry</i>

555
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,912
<i>than ruling
with a strong hand.</i>

556
00:38:59,261 --> 00:39:00,995
<i>Hurrem
fuels the rumors</i>

557
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,198
<i>that the military
want to take his throne</i>

558
00:39:03,232 --> 00:39:05,633
<i>and replace him with Mustafa.</i>

559
00:39:06,734 --> 00:39:08,370
<i>The prince has become a pawn</i>

560
00:39:08,404 --> 00:39:11,373
<i>in the ceaseless game
of power.</i>

561
00:39:23,651 --> 00:39:25,687
<i>Suleiman the Magnificent,</i>

562
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,423
<i>Suleiman the Conqueror,</i>

563
00:39:27,455 --> 00:39:30,292
<i>patron and protector
of empires,</i>

564
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,027
<i>Suleiman the Father,</i>

565
00:39:32,061 --> 00:39:33,362
<i>was left with a choice</i>

566
00:39:33,395 --> 00:39:36,564
<i>that he knows
will break his heart.</i>

567
00:39:43,471 --> 00:39:46,408
<i>Gulten, meantime,
saw no reason</i>

568
00:39:46,442 --> 00:39:49,044
<i>why she should remain unseen.</i>

569
00:39:52,547 --> 00:39:56,684
<i>Given she was carrying the son
of the next Sultan.</i>

570
00:40:02,557 --> 00:40:04,625
<i>Despite all my warnings,</i>

571
00:40:04,659 --> 00:40:08,730
<i>she parades her newly swollen
breasts and belly.</i>

572
00:40:08,763 --> 00:40:12,368
<i>And the whispers soon spread
throughout the seraglio.</i>

573
00:40:18,573 --> 00:40:22,011
<i>The terrible plottings
move all too quickly.</i>

574
00:40:47,969 --> 00:40:50,439
<i>Prince Mustafa
comes innocently</i>

575
00:40:50,472 --> 00:40:52,640
<i>into the presence
of his father,</i>

576
00:40:52,673 --> 00:40:55,444
<i>to reassure him
of his loyalty.</i>

577
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:08,723
<i>And the mutes are
waiting for him.</i>

578
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,595
<i>He cried out
to his Janissaries,</i>

579
00:41:14,629 --> 00:41:15,930
<i>who loved him,</i>

580
00:41:15,963 --> 00:41:18,933
<i>but his voice was crushed
and his breath stopped</i>

581
00:41:18,966 --> 00:41:21,803
<i>by the string
of his father's bow.</i>

582
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:43,991
Gulten!

583
00:42:16,991 --> 00:42:18,527
<i>"Make a wish!</i>

584
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,862
"Save yourself, Gulten!"

585
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,835
Just a few words
and she could have been free

586
00:42:27,869 --> 00:42:31,340
<i>to bear her child in safety,</i>

587
00:42:31,373 --> 00:42:35,077
<i>and I to spirit away at last
to the Realm of Djinn.</i>

588
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:37,479
<i>But she ran into the hands
of the assassins.</i>

589
00:42:39,214 --> 00:42:41,316
<i>I was about
to take them by force,</i>

590
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,918
<i>when I was blocked
by a follower of Iblis.</i>

591
00:43:26,428 --> 00:43:27,429
Gulten!

592
00:43:43,445 --> 00:43:46,747
<i>She made
no wish to save herself.</i>

593
00:43:47,949 --> 00:43:50,918
<i>No wish was made
to save us both.</i>

594
00:43:58,327 --> 00:44:00,128
So, there I was,

595
00:44:00,162 --> 00:44:02,264
or there I was not,
might you say,

596
00:44:02,297 --> 00:44:05,500
almost emancipated
and tethered to this world

597
00:44:05,534 --> 00:44:07,868
by a third wish unperformed.

598
00:44:07,902 --> 00:44:09,338
But you realize, don't you,

599
00:44:09,371 --> 00:44:12,541
that you've just told me
the story of a woman
who was doomed

600
00:44:12,574 --> 00:44:14,610
as a consequence
of the wishes she made?

601
00:44:14,643 --> 00:44:17,479
Yes, but her failure
to complete the wishes

602
00:44:17,512 --> 00:44:19,581
also doomed me.

603
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,717
Could nobody else
complete the wish?

604
00:44:21,749 --> 00:44:23,285
That was my hope.

605
00:44:23,318 --> 00:44:25,354
And that would
finally liberate you?

606
00:44:25,387 --> 00:44:27,822
That was my only hope.

607
00:44:27,855 --> 00:44:30,192
But you were
rendered invisible.

608
00:44:30,225 --> 00:44:31,260
Like a ghost.

609
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:33,128
Wandering unseen.

610
00:44:33,161 --> 00:44:34,062
And your bottle,

611
00:44:34,096 --> 00:44:36,331
<i>hidden under
the loosened stone</i>

612
00:44:36,365 --> 00:44:37,699
<i>known only to the dead Gulten.</i>

613
00:44:37,733 --> 00:44:39,601
<i>Yes,
it was a predicament.</i>

614
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:43,639
<i>I tried to attract
the attention of someone,</i>

615
00:44:43,672 --> 00:44:45,407
<i>anyone that could help me.</i>

616
00:44:46,675 --> 00:44:48,310
<i>My stars, how I tried.</i>

617
00:44:48,343 --> 00:44:50,878
<i>I followed their scent,
their every step.</i>

618
00:44:50,911 --> 00:44:53,115
<i>Willing, pleading, screaming.</i>

619
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,982
<i>Anything to draw them to me.</i>

620
00:45:24,046 --> 00:45:27,783
And I do this piteously
for 100 years,

621
00:45:27,815 --> 00:45:31,053
<i>and with every failure,
my will begins to fade.</i>

622
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,827
<i>And then in 1620,</i>

623
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:43,565
<i>hope comes in the form
of a boy with a sword.</i>

624
00:45:50,505 --> 00:45:52,574
Murad! Murad!

625
00:46:06,588 --> 00:46:08,156
Murad!

626
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:19,234
<i>By some means,
this boy senses me.</i>

627
00:46:19,267 --> 00:46:22,137
<i>I'm able to draw him
to the stone.</i>

628
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:12,454
Ibrahim!

629
00:47:13,188 --> 00:47:14,356
<i>Gel.</i>

630
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,459
Murad!

631
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,195
Ibrahim!

632
00:47:20,228 --> 00:47:22,097
<i>And just as
I am about to be delivered</i>

633
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,565
<i>into their hands,</i>

634
00:47:23,598 --> 00:47:24,866
<i>their mother finds them.</i>

635
00:47:27,269 --> 00:47:28,904
<i>She is Kosem,</i>

636
00:47:28,936 --> 00:47:31,139
<i>a widow of the Sultan,
Ahmed the First.</i>

637
00:47:31,173 --> 00:47:33,675
<i>And the boys are next in line
for the throne.</i>

638
00:47:36,378 --> 00:47:38,580
<i>When I see
the hair on his legs,</i>

639
00:47:38,613 --> 00:47:41,716
<i>I know that somewhere
in Murad's bloodline</i>

640
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,652
<i>pulses the power of a djinn.</i>

641
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,221
<i>I follow him everywhere,</i>

642
00:47:46,254 --> 00:47:48,590
<i>determined to draw him back
to the stone.</i>

643
00:47:48,623 --> 00:47:51,827
<i>But at the age of 11,
he ascends the throne</i>

644
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:53,961
<i>and becomes
Sultan Murad the Fourth.</i>

645
00:47:53,994 --> 00:47:56,932
<i>And caught up
by the usual intrigues,</i>

646
00:47:56,964 --> 00:48:00,235
<i>he is even more lost to me.</i>

647
00:48:00,268 --> 00:48:03,205
<i>At 20, he leads
his armies to war.</i>

648
00:48:03,238 --> 00:48:04,940
<i>He battles alongside his men</i>

649
00:48:04,972 --> 00:48:07,442
<i>in the Caucasus
and Mesopotamia.</i>

650
00:48:08,477 --> 00:48:10,912
<i>Stories are told
of his recklessness,</i>

651
00:48:10,946 --> 00:48:13,114
<i>even with his own life.</i>

652
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,357
<i>I despair of
ever seeing him again.</i>

653
00:48:23,592 --> 00:48:28,263
Hope is a monster, Alithea,
and I am its plaything.

654
00:48:28,763 --> 00:48:29,931
So he died?

655
00:48:29,965 --> 00:48:31,433
Not in battle.

656
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,168
Back in Istanbul,

657
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:35,270
Kosem needs
to protect the throne.

658
00:48:35,303 --> 00:48:37,105
She needs to protect Ibrahim.

659
00:48:37,138 --> 00:48:39,007
- <i>The little brother?
- Yes.</i>

660
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:45,080
<i>He is last
of the Ottoman line.</i>

661
00:48:45,914 --> 00:48:48,383
<i>He has to produce
male children.</i>

662
00:48:50,685 --> 00:48:55,524
<i>So, Kosem locks him in a cage
lined entirely with sable.</i>

663
00:49:02,931 --> 00:49:04,533
<i>Quite the prison.</i>

664
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:07,168
<i>And one
he will never want to leave.</i>

665
00:49:22,684 --> 00:49:24,686
<i>It debauches him royally.</i>

666
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:27,756
<i>He believes the greater
the expanse of flesh,</i>

667
00:49:27,789 --> 00:49:29,190
<i>the more intense the pleasure.</i>

668
00:49:29,224 --> 00:49:33,194
<i>So, Kosem seeks out beauties
voluptuous and immense,</i>

669
00:49:33,228 --> 00:49:36,464
<i>and brings them to his couch.</i>

670
00:49:36,498 --> 00:49:40,635
My fate turns specifically
on this fetish.

671
00:49:40,669 --> 00:49:41,836
How's that?

672
00:49:42,804 --> 00:49:44,006
You'll see.

673
00:50:14,669 --> 00:50:16,271
<i>Murad is back.</i>

674
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:18,139
<i>And though
he returns a conqueror,</i>

675
00:50:18,173 --> 00:50:20,875
<i>he cannot shed
his robes of blood.</i>

676
00:50:21,943 --> 00:50:24,646
<i>War had truly rotted his soul.</i>

677
00:50:44,366 --> 00:50:46,201
<i>I wait until he is alone.</i>

678
00:50:46,234 --> 00:50:49,371
<i>I am determined to draw him
back to the stone.</i>

679
00:50:49,404 --> 00:50:52,540
I don't want to interrupt,
but I do have a question.

680
00:50:52,574 --> 00:50:54,776
Did it matter to you
what kind of wish

681
00:50:54,809 --> 00:50:56,311
such a man might make?

682
00:50:56,811 --> 00:50:58,680
One so insatiable.

683
00:50:58,713 --> 00:51:00,315
No.

684
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:02,250
Not even if
it were profoundly evil?

685
00:51:02,283 --> 00:51:03,752
Not if it meant my freedom.

686
00:51:03,785 --> 00:51:07,789
The truth is he has
other things on his mind.

687
00:51:09,324 --> 00:51:11,593
<i>He believes he is invincible,</i>

688
00:51:11,626 --> 00:51:16,197
<i>and to rule indefinitely,
he must be rid of all rivals.</i>

689
00:51:29,078 --> 00:51:30,311
Ibrahim.

690
00:51:33,682 --> 00:51:34,816
Ibrahim.

691
00:52:36,578 --> 00:52:39,048
Kosem needs to stop him.

692
00:52:39,081 --> 00:52:41,150
Somehow, she needed
to distract him

693
00:52:41,183 --> 00:52:43,918
from his bloodlust
with other gratifications.

694
00:52:48,556 --> 00:52:52,327
<i>First, she arranges for him
to be perpetually drunk.</i>

695
00:52:54,262 --> 00:52:56,165
And then she tries
something very shrewd.

696
00:52:56,198 --> 00:52:57,632
Something that
you might enjoy.

697
00:53:04,006 --> 00:53:05,273
<i>She sends to find,</i>

698
00:53:05,306 --> 00:53:07,742
<i>from all corners
of the empire,</i>

699
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,745
<i>the best storytellers.</i>

700
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:31,900
<i>Those who are not persuasive</i>

701
00:53:31,933 --> 00:53:35,436
<i>flee in fear
or fall to his impatience.</i>

702
00:53:45,547 --> 00:53:47,283
<i>There is only one</i>

703
00:53:47,315 --> 00:53:49,417
<i>who has the ability
to enchant him.</i>

704
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:53,555
<i>To soothe with stories,</i>

705
00:53:53,588 --> 00:53:56,624
<i>to hold him hostage
to their unfolding.</i>

706
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,115
<i>This is his only friend.</i>

707
00:54:22,517 --> 00:54:25,687
<i>And that friendship
turns to love.</i>

708
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:29,824
<i>Since there is nothing else
for me to do,</i>

709
00:54:29,858 --> 00:54:30,859
<i>I listen gratefully,</i>

710
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:34,495
<i>for I, too, love being lost
in his stories.</i>

711
00:54:39,868 --> 00:54:41,603
<i>When the old man dies,</i>

712
00:54:41,636 --> 00:54:43,938
<i>all in the palace
flee to the streets,</i>

713
00:54:43,972 --> 00:54:48,177
<i>for they fear Murad's grief
will incur fresh murder.</i>

714
00:54:52,348 --> 00:54:57,619
<i>But he just sits, and howls,
and drinks until he is empty.</i>

715
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:26,547
<i>And my patience is rewarded.</i>

716
00:55:27,548 --> 00:55:28,683
<i>For in this state,</i>

717
00:55:28,716 --> 00:55:31,086
<i>I am finally able
to get his attention</i>

718
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,056
<i>and draw him
back to the secret bathroom.</i>

719
00:55:34,089 --> 00:55:35,723
<i>Oh, I know
where this is going.</i>

720
00:55:35,757 --> 00:55:38,459
<i>He's going to be too weak
to lift the stone.</i>

721
00:55:38,493 --> 00:55:41,230
Too weak even
to turn the latch.

722
00:55:43,564 --> 00:55:47,102
So, he leaves and drinks
himself to permanent sleep.

723
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,071
Oh!

724
00:55:49,104 --> 00:55:50,672
And there I am,

725
00:55:50,705 --> 00:55:53,208
left to my own oblivion,

726
00:55:53,242 --> 00:55:55,543
with no one
to hear my voice,

727
00:55:55,576 --> 00:55:59,081
no one to know me,
nor feel me, nor sense me.

728
00:55:59,114 --> 00:56:01,449
You can't imagine.

729
00:56:04,386 --> 00:56:06,454
Well, actually, I can.

730
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:09,857
Can you imagine
the loneliness?

731
00:56:10,558 --> 00:56:12,727
How it might overwhelm?

732
00:56:13,028 --> 00:56:14,796
I can.

733
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:17,465
We exist only
if we are real to others.

734
00:56:17,498 --> 00:56:18,800
Do you agree?

735
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:19,867
I do.

736
00:56:19,901 --> 00:56:22,537
This, then,
is our fate, Alithea.

737
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:25,673
If you make no wish at all,

738
00:56:25,707 --> 00:56:27,409
I will be caught
between worlds,

739
00:56:27,443 --> 00:56:30,645
invisible and alone,
for all of time.

740
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,549
Make a wish, Alithea.

741
00:56:35,451 --> 00:56:37,485
Make it your heart's desire.

742
00:56:45,327 --> 00:56:49,098
I'd be more careful
if I were you.

743
00:56:49,131 --> 00:56:51,400
Obviously, you managed
to find your way out.

744
00:56:51,433 --> 00:56:52,567
More or less.

745
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,203
I'm beginning to think
I'm in the presence

746
00:56:54,236 --> 00:56:55,237
of a trickster.

747
00:56:57,206 --> 00:56:59,640
That would be so much better.

748
00:56:59,674 --> 00:57:01,542
My work would be
so much easier.

749
00:57:01,576 --> 00:57:04,380
But the truth is,
I am just an idiot

750
00:57:04,413 --> 00:57:07,016
who has been
extravagantly unlucky.

751
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:10,119
Well, I have to take
your word for that.

752
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:20,895
So?

753
00:57:23,698 --> 00:57:27,002
Ibrahim, I suppose,
becomes Sultan?

754
00:57:27,036 --> 00:57:31,606
<i>Ibrahim has
to be dragged to the throne.</i>

755
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:50,725
<i>He appoints one of
his concubines</i>

756
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,461
<i>Governor of Damascus.</i>

757
00:57:52,494 --> 00:57:54,962
<i>Her name is Sugar Lump.</i>

758
00:57:54,996 --> 00:57:57,232
<i>By every measure,
his favorite.</i>

759
00:57:59,301 --> 00:58:00,968
<i>Had she not been free to roam,</i>

760
00:58:01,003 --> 00:58:03,905
<i>she would not have found
the secret bathroom.</i>

761
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:06,308
<i>Had she not decided
to take a bath,</i>

762
00:58:06,341 --> 00:58:08,609
<i>it would not have overfilled.</i>

763
00:58:08,643 --> 00:58:09,744
<i>Had she not been clumsy</i>

764
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:11,146
<i>as she walked
across the floor,</i>

765
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:13,915
<i>she would not have slipped,
smashed the stone,</i>

766
00:58:14,816 --> 00:58:17,252
- and found my bottle.
- Ah, yeah.

767
00:58:34,702 --> 00:58:37,905
<i>To be honest, I should
have been more dignified.</i>

768
00:58:37,939 --> 00:58:40,675
<i>But I began to beg,
shamelessly.</i>

769
00:59:07,369 --> 00:59:08,903
<i>"I wish you were back</i>

770
00:59:08,936 --> 00:59:12,174
<i>" in your bottle at the bottom
of the Bosphorus."</i>

771
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:16,445
So here I am,

772
00:59:16,478 --> 00:59:18,980
fallen into
your careful hands.

773
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:23,385
Seems we cannot
escape each other.

774
00:59:23,418 --> 00:59:25,686
You have me at your mercy.

775
00:59:31,926 --> 00:59:33,195
This wishing...

776
00:59:34,896 --> 00:59:36,998
It's a hazardous art.

777
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:40,035
"I wish" brings
infinite unravelings.

778
00:59:40,068 --> 00:59:40,902
Not necessarily.

779
00:59:40,935 --> 00:59:42,204
Well, it's there
in all your own stories.

780
00:59:42,237 --> 00:59:43,071
I know, but...

781
00:59:43,105 --> 00:59:44,506
You say
you're not a trickster,

782
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:48,076
and you say that you and I
are the authors of this story.

783
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:51,313
But I'm not able
to write myself out of it.

784
00:59:51,346 --> 00:59:52,281
Correct.

785
00:59:52,314 --> 00:59:56,118
Why don't you just hop back
into your bottle

786
00:59:56,151 --> 00:59:57,885
and I'll give it
to someone more gullible?

787
00:59:57,919 --> 01:00:00,821
Someone more desperate.
Someone more greedy.

788
01:00:00,855 --> 01:00:02,224
I'm not getting back
in the bottle.

789
01:00:02,257 --> 01:00:03,091
Why not?

790
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:04,926
I'm not getting back
in the bottle.

791
01:00:04,959 --> 01:00:06,928
Well, I am not
making three wishes.

792
01:00:06,961 --> 01:00:09,298
Then you are sending me
to my oblivion.

793
01:00:09,331 --> 01:00:10,599
Oh, you're impossible.

794
01:00:10,632 --> 01:00:12,568
And you are giving me
a headache.

795
01:00:12,601 --> 01:00:14,269
All right. All right.

796
01:00:14,303 --> 01:00:16,837
Here's what I'll do.
I will make three wishes.

797
01:00:16,871 --> 01:00:17,972
- I will.
- Before you die?

798
01:00:18,006 --> 01:00:19,774
Right now.
One after the other.

799
01:00:19,807 --> 01:00:20,908
- Ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

800
01:00:20,942 --> 01:00:23,844
Number one. I wish
your headache were gone.

801
01:00:26,747 --> 01:00:28,483
Number two.

802
01:00:28,517 --> 01:00:30,385
I wish for a sip of this tea.

803
01:00:32,753 --> 01:00:35,756
And finally, I wish
for another one of those.

804
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:37,092
You mock me.

805
01:00:37,125 --> 01:00:38,793
Three wishes,
perfectly simple,

806
01:00:38,826 --> 01:00:39,927
and theoretically safe.

807
01:00:39,961 --> 01:00:41,996
I was imprisoned
by Solomon precisely

808
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:44,499
because I cried out
my heart's desire.

809
01:00:44,533 --> 01:00:47,569
Only by granting you yours
may I earn my release.

810
01:00:47,603 --> 01:00:49,204
Yes, well,
I appreciate the symmetry,

811
01:00:49,238 --> 01:00:50,405
but the thing is this,

812
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:53,542
I cannot for the life of me
summon up one eligible wish.

813
01:00:53,575 --> 01:00:54,842
And you're asking me
for three.

814
01:00:54,875 --> 01:00:57,312
Is there any life in you?
Are you even alive?

815
01:00:57,346 --> 01:00:58,946
You know, in some cultures,

816
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:00,682
absence of desire
means enlightenment.

817
01:01:00,716 --> 01:01:02,883
Then you are a pious fool.

818
01:01:02,917 --> 01:01:05,354
If I'm content,
why tempt fate?

819
01:01:05,387 --> 01:01:06,588
And you're a coward.

820
01:01:06,622 --> 01:01:07,955
Don't goad me.

821
01:01:07,989 --> 01:01:09,924
There is no human,
no angel, nor djinn

822
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:11,159
that wouldn't grasp
at the chance

823
01:01:11,193 --> 01:01:12,827
to fulfill
their deepest longings,

824
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:14,496
and I am saddled with the one

825
01:01:14,529 --> 01:01:15,830
who claims to want
nothing at all.

826
01:01:15,863 --> 01:01:17,332
Alithea Binnie,
you are a liar!

827
01:01:17,366 --> 01:01:20,636
You know, I am beginning
to wish we never met.

828
01:01:20,669 --> 01:01:22,170
No! <i>Nyet!</i>

829
01:01:22,204 --> 01:01:23,338
Don't say that!

830
01:01:54,436 --> 01:01:55,437
So...

831
01:01:56,871 --> 01:01:59,107
that's happened to you before.

832
01:02:00,542 --> 01:02:02,377
And it was bad.

833
01:02:02,411 --> 01:02:04,279
'Twas bad.

834
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:07,582
'Twas bitter.

835
01:02:07,616 --> 01:02:09,917
'Twas the cruelest wish
of all.

836
01:02:11,586 --> 01:02:14,656
You were undone
by silliness yet again.

837
01:02:16,124 --> 01:02:18,527
I'm here because of a genius.

838
01:02:19,328 --> 01:02:20,928
Who was it this time?

839
01:02:21,962 --> 01:02:23,532
She was Zefir.

840
01:02:25,467 --> 01:02:29,471
Rarely among humankind
has there been such a wonder.

841
01:02:30,439 --> 01:02:33,342
But you're here
because of her folly.

842
01:02:36,311 --> 01:02:40,248
I ended up in this
as a consequence of Zefir.

843
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:43,719
And this is the story

844
01:02:43,752 --> 01:02:46,987
you've been avoiding
telling me all along.

845
01:02:47,022 --> 01:02:50,858
This is the story I've avoided
telling even myself.

846
01:03:02,704 --> 01:03:04,905
<i>Zefir was a foundling,</i>

847
01:03:04,939 --> 01:03:07,609
<i>married at 12
to a wealthy merchant.</i>

848
01:03:09,111 --> 01:03:11,279
<i>He was much older than her,
and kind,</i>

849
01:03:11,313 --> 01:03:16,585
<i>if you think keeping someone
like a bird in a cage is kind.</i>

850
01:03:16,618 --> 01:03:19,421
<i>There were two older wives,
who did not like her</i>

851
01:03:19,454 --> 01:03:21,456
<i>and did not
talk to her at all.</i>

852
01:03:39,207 --> 01:03:41,109
<i>Everyone,
including the servants,</i>

853
01:03:41,143 --> 01:03:42,943
<i>seemed to be mocking her.</i>

854
01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:59,027
<i>She had neither
etiquette nor learning.</i>

855
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:00,961
<i>She grew to no great beauty</i>

856
01:04:00,995 --> 01:04:04,065
<i>and was angry
without knowing why.</i>

857
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:21,149
<i>As the fates would have it,
my bottle came to her</i>

858
01:04:21,183 --> 01:04:24,619
<i>as a love token
from her husband.</i>

859
01:04:29,558 --> 01:04:32,761
<i>And when she had finished
satisfying him</i>

860
01:04:32,794 --> 01:04:34,062
<i>and was finally alone,</i>

861
01:04:34,095 --> 01:04:36,331
<i>she managed to prise it open.</i>

862
01:05:07,395 --> 01:05:10,031
<i>It was as if
she was waiting for me.</i>

863
01:05:10,065 --> 01:05:13,168
<i>I saw at once
that she was sharp,</i>

864
01:05:13,201 --> 01:05:17,038
<i>and she saw
that I was desperate</i>

865
01:05:17,072 --> 01:05:19,241
<i>for freedom and conversation.</i>

866
01:05:19,274 --> 01:05:21,776
<i>I told her my story,
as I have told you,</i>

867
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:26,448
<i>and she revealed herself to me
by the things she had made.</i>

868
01:05:26,481 --> 01:05:28,350
<i>Gel. Gel.</i>

869
01:06:03,685 --> 01:06:04,719
<i>Gel.</i>

870
01:06:15,564 --> 01:06:17,299
<i>She could have been remembered</i>

871
01:06:17,332 --> 01:06:19,234
<i>like the genius da Vinci,</i>

872
01:06:19,267 --> 01:06:20,535
<i>whose theories on flight</i>

873
01:06:20,569 --> 01:06:23,338
<i>were the talk
of sultans and kings.</i>

874
01:06:24,906 --> 01:06:28,510
<i>She was a skilled artist,
but no one saw her art.</i>

875
01:06:34,549 --> 01:06:37,218
<i>She told me
she was eaten up</i>

876
01:06:37,252 --> 01:06:39,454
<i>with unused power.</i>

877
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:41,389
<i>She thought
she might be a witch.</i>

878
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:44,225
<i>Except, she said,
if she were a man,</i>

879
01:06:44,259 --> 01:06:48,096
<i>her intellect would have been
ordinarily accepted.</i>

880
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:50,432
<i>She was a woman
ardent for learning,</i>

881
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:53,868
<i>and I knew
what her first wish would be.</i>

882
01:07:11,286 --> 01:07:12,887
<i>And it delighted me</i>

883
01:07:12,921 --> 01:07:14,723
<i>to fulfill this wish.</i>

884
01:07:43,652 --> 01:07:47,222
<i>So, I taught her
histories, philosophies,</i>

885
01:07:47,255 --> 01:07:48,623
<i>languages, poetry.</i>

886
01:07:48,657 --> 01:07:51,326
<i>I taught her
astronomy, mathematic,</i>

887
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,495
<i>which was bliss to her.</i>

888
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:55,830
<i>I brought her
books and writings,</i>

889
01:07:55,864 --> 01:07:59,567
<i>which we hid
in her collection of bottles.</i>

890
01:08:20,022 --> 01:08:21,990
<i>Sabah...</i>

891
01:08:22,024 --> 01:08:23,491
<i>Sabah...</i>

892
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:43,244
<i>She could always
call on Aristotle</i>

893
01:08:43,278 --> 01:08:45,413
<i>from a red glass jar,</i>

894
01:08:45,447 --> 01:08:48,184
<i>or Euclid from a green,</i>

895
01:08:48,216 --> 01:08:50,585
<i>Pythagoras, Spinoza,</i>

896
01:08:50,618 --> 01:08:53,455
<i>without needing me
to re-embody them.</i>

897
01:09:03,698 --> 01:09:06,068
We had the whole world
in her room,

898
01:09:06,102 --> 01:09:09,270
and I lost my heart to her.

899
01:09:12,741 --> 01:09:16,978
'Twas my bliss
to make her happy.

900
01:09:18,813 --> 01:09:20,015
To see her flourish.

901
01:09:21,683 --> 01:09:24,352
And she flourished
in every way.

902
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:26,254
<i>Totalmente.</i>

903
01:09:37,233 --> 01:09:38,633
<i>She began to rebel</i>

904
01:09:38,666 --> 01:09:40,902
<i>even against
the gestures of submission</i>

905
01:09:40,935 --> 01:09:42,303
<i>that her husband required,</i>

906
01:09:42,337 --> 01:09:45,507
<i>for she had acquired
a mastery of love-craft,</i>

907
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:47,143
<i>out of reach of any human</i>

908
01:09:47,176 --> 01:09:49,511
<i>that had not
made love to a djinn.</i>

909
01:10:07,129 --> 01:10:10,365
<i>His cravings
for her became an obsession.</i>

910
01:10:20,642 --> 01:10:22,310
<i>And when he would come to her,</i>

911
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:26,648
<i>I would leave her room
and journey the skies.</i>

912
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:30,552
<i>I saw the mountains,
the oceans...</i>

913
01:10:31,386 --> 01:10:33,354
<i>I saw the beasts
of the forest,</i>

914
01:10:33,388 --> 01:10:35,890
<i>where no man treads.</i>

915
01:10:35,924 --> 01:10:39,928
<i>And when I would return,
she would be waiting for me.</i>

916
01:10:39,961 --> 01:10:44,066
<i>I would tell her of my day,
and she would faint with joy</i>

917
01:10:44,099 --> 01:10:45,900
<i>and disappointment.</i>

918
01:10:45,934 --> 01:10:49,470
<i>Why did she not
make a wish to be free?</i>

919
01:10:49,504 --> 01:10:53,075
<i>There was something
more important to her.</i>

920
01:10:53,108 --> 01:10:55,376
<i>She had devised
a "mathematica,"</i>

921
01:10:55,410 --> 01:10:58,546
<i>a language
to explain the forces</i>

922
01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:01,649
<i>which bring space, and time,
and matter into being.</i>

923
01:11:01,683 --> 01:11:03,351
<i>She was Promethean, brave.</i>

924
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,787
<i>But she could not solve
this puzzle.</i>

925
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:07,655
<i>She needed a key,</i>

926
01:11:07,689 --> 01:11:10,825
<i>a key to open the doors
of her perception.</i>

927
01:11:21,502 --> 01:11:25,406
So, she used her second wish.

928
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:29,111
I taught her to dream
as djinn do, awake.

929
01:12:00,675 --> 01:12:04,579
<i>And this way,
the solutions came to her.</i>

930
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:08,284
<i>She was able
to explain powers invisible,</i>

931
01:12:08,317 --> 01:12:11,519
electromagnetic fields
and forces...

932
01:12:11,552 --> 01:12:14,656
The very stuff
of which djinn are made.

933
01:12:14,689 --> 01:12:16,392
You're electromagnetic?

934
01:12:16,424 --> 01:12:20,595
As you are dust,
I am made of subtle fire.

935
01:12:21,363 --> 01:12:23,731
And when she was
to bear a child,

936
01:12:23,765 --> 01:12:26,235
I was plagued with happiness,

937
01:12:26,268 --> 01:12:28,337
for I knew
it would strengthen us.

938
01:12:28,370 --> 01:12:30,005
She was carrying your child?

939
01:12:30,705 --> 01:12:33,808
A child, of fire and dust.

940
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:37,612
So, where did it go wrong?

941
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:39,747
Alithea, I loved her.

942
01:12:40,615 --> 01:12:42,318
I loved the fervor
of her mind.

943
01:12:42,351 --> 01:12:43,484
I loved her anger.

944
01:12:43,518 --> 01:12:44,585
I loved my power

945
01:12:44,619 --> 01:12:47,822
to turn her frowns
into smiles.

946
01:12:49,425 --> 01:12:52,061
I loved her more than Sheba.

947
01:12:52,094 --> 01:12:53,628
More than your own freedom?

948
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:54,896
Yes.

949
01:12:54,929 --> 01:12:58,434
It became my greatest desire
to... to keep her,

950
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:00,568
to remain her prisoner.

951
01:13:00,601 --> 01:13:05,307
The thought of being set free
sickened my heart.

952
01:13:10,145 --> 01:13:14,482
I caught myself stopping her
lest she make her third wish.

953
01:13:14,882 --> 01:13:16,218
Oh, gosh.

954
01:13:19,954 --> 01:13:21,723
I made a mess of it.

955
01:13:22,991 --> 01:13:25,994
<i>She began to accuse me
of trapping her,</i>

956
01:13:26,028 --> 01:13:27,729
<i>like her husband.</i>

957
01:13:29,797 --> 01:13:32,967
<i>I tried
to make amends.</i>

958
01:13:33,002 --> 01:13:36,771
<i>To atone, I would
put myself in the bottle.</i>

959
01:13:37,572 --> 01:13:38,873
<i>To be sealed.</i>

960
01:13:38,906 --> 01:13:41,676
<i>That way, she could have
more power over me.</i>

961
01:13:54,356 --> 01:13:57,092
To be nothing in a bottle.

962
01:13:57,126 --> 01:13:58,693
I could do that for her.

963
01:13:59,495 --> 01:14:03,265
And every time,
it would appease.

964
01:14:03,298 --> 01:14:06,667
Every time,
except for the last.

965
01:14:06,701 --> 01:14:11,407
<i>When, like a sudden squall,
all thunder and lightning,</i>

966
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,443
<i>she began to weep and wail,
and said,</i>

967
01:14:14,476 --> 01:14:17,545
<i>"I wish I could forget
I ever met you."</i>

968
01:14:23,218 --> 01:14:25,853
<i>And she did, on the instant.</i>

969
01:14:30,825 --> 01:14:33,728
<i>She was out. I was in.</i>

970
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:35,630
<i>She'd forgotten me.</i>

971
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:40,135
<i>Alithea, how can it be...</i>

972
01:14:42,037 --> 01:14:45,606
a mistake to love
someone entirely?

973
01:15:11,033 --> 01:15:12,267
I have a wish.

974
01:15:16,938 --> 01:15:20,275
However, I'm afraid it may be
too much to ask.

975
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:27,015
Is it within my power?

976
01:15:27,549 --> 01:15:30,651
I hope so. I do hope so.

977
01:15:33,288 --> 01:15:35,324
Is it your heart's desire?

978
01:15:35,857 --> 01:15:38,026
Yeah, I'm certain of it.

979
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,042
See, erm,

980
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:57,045
I'm here to love you.

981
01:15:59,981 --> 01:16:01,183
And, uh,

982
01:16:02,584 --> 01:16:06,155
I wish for you
to love me in return.

983
01:16:07,855 --> 01:16:10,825
You want us
to make love-craft?

984
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,428
Yeah, that too.

985
01:16:13,462 --> 01:16:14,530
All of it.

986
01:16:14,563 --> 01:16:18,567
And you would
abandon yourself to this?

987
01:16:20,502 --> 01:16:22,171
Yes.

988
01:16:22,204 --> 01:16:23,305
Yes.

989
01:16:25,474 --> 01:16:29,244
I want our solitudes
to be together.

990
01:16:29,278 --> 01:16:33,981
I want that love
professed in ageless tales.

991
01:16:34,016 --> 01:16:38,320
I want that longing you felt
for the Queen of Sheba,

992
01:16:38,353 --> 01:16:42,457
and that love you gave
to your genius, Zefir.

993
01:16:42,491 --> 01:16:44,226
I want it.

994
01:16:57,139 --> 01:16:58,407
Me?

995
01:17:00,509 --> 01:17:01,909
You.

996
01:17:08,617 --> 01:17:10,085
You?

997
01:17:12,054 --> 01:17:13,222
Me.

998
01:17:20,662 --> 01:17:22,130
Is it too much?

999
01:17:23,065 --> 01:17:25,334
Is it all too much to ask?

1000
01:17:44,752 --> 01:17:45,953
Come.

1001
01:17:59,101 --> 01:18:02,604
<i>What are we to do
with longings awoken?</i>

1002
01:18:02,638 --> 01:18:04,039
<i>How can I persuade you</i>

1003
01:18:04,072 --> 01:18:06,408
<i>that I once found love
with a djinn?</i>

1004
01:18:08,644 --> 01:18:11,480
<i>In any case,
few would believe me.</i>

1005
01:18:13,148 --> 01:18:16,817
<i>Love is not something
we come to by reason.</i>

1006
01:18:19,054 --> 01:18:21,323
<i>It's more like a vapor,</i>

1007
01:18:21,356 --> 01:18:23,258
<i>a dream, perhaps,</i>

1008
01:18:23,292 --> 01:18:25,427
<i>to lure us
into the enchantment</i>

1009
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:27,162
<i>of our own stories.</i>

1010
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:30,265
<i>If that's so,</i>

1011
01:18:30,299 --> 01:18:32,501
<i>how are we to know
if it's ever real?</i>

1012
01:18:34,269 --> 01:18:37,972
<i>Is it a truth,
or simply a madness?</i>

1013
01:19:24,919 --> 01:19:27,456
I leave
for London today.

1014
01:19:27,489 --> 01:19:29,057
Will you come home with me?

1015
01:19:31,259 --> 01:19:34,162
It's not such
an easy place nowadays.

1016
01:19:35,197 --> 01:19:37,499
But it'll be better
if you're there.

1017
01:19:47,409 --> 01:19:49,611
Over here, please.

1018
01:19:51,346 --> 01:19:52,381
Hands up.

1019
01:20:00,756 --> 01:20:02,858
Please step out.

1020
01:20:02,890 --> 01:20:04,459
What is in your pockets?

1021
01:20:05,193 --> 01:20:06,194
Oh.

1022
01:20:07,095 --> 01:20:10,399
Uh, it's an empty bottle
and a top.

1023
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:12,868
Please put it through X-ray.

1024
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:13,934
It is very delicate,

1025
01:20:13,968 --> 01:20:15,237
and I don't want it
to get damaged.

1026
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:17,239
It will not be damaged.
Please put through X-ray.

1027
01:20:17,272 --> 01:20:18,607
I would prefer that
it didn't go in the...

1028
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:19,940
Passport. Boarding pass.

1029
01:20:21,309 --> 01:20:22,310
Thank you.

1030
01:20:32,754 --> 01:20:33,822
It's quite fragile.

1031
01:20:33,855 --> 01:20:35,123
Madam.

1032
01:20:39,428 --> 01:20:41,163
It's a saltshaker.

1033
01:20:48,770 --> 01:20:49,970
Oh.

1034
01:20:50,572 --> 01:20:52,707
No! No X-ray! Please!

1035
01:20:52,741 --> 01:20:54,942
Stop, madam, stop.

1036
01:21:11,493 --> 01:21:12,527
Madam.

1037
01:21:13,195 --> 01:21:14,196
Oh.

1038
01:21:54,903 --> 01:21:56,438
In your own time.

1039
01:22:52,994 --> 01:22:55,196
The air is thick here.

1040
01:22:56,164 --> 01:23:00,368
Full of insistent voices
and rushing faces.

1041
01:23:00,902 --> 01:23:02,637
Oh?

1042
01:23:02,671 --> 01:23:05,240
Like Tiny Einstein?

1043
01:23:05,273 --> 01:23:07,609
Television, and phone towers,
and such?

1044
01:23:07,642 --> 01:23:09,144
Yes.

1045
01:23:09,177 --> 01:23:12,914
Yes. All your
ingenious devices

1046
01:23:12,948 --> 01:23:14,883
all murmuring at once.

1047
01:23:14,916 --> 01:23:16,785
Bend your head.

1048
01:23:23,525 --> 01:23:25,560
You hear all that?

1049
01:23:28,229 --> 01:23:31,199
I also see it and feel it.

1050
01:23:31,232 --> 01:23:34,202
I am a transmitter.

1051
01:23:34,235 --> 01:23:36,137
Isn't it all too much?

1052
01:23:37,172 --> 01:23:38,607
I am a djinn.

1053
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:39,741
I can adapt.

1054
01:23:41,743 --> 01:23:43,311
I'll soon get used to it.

1055
01:23:43,345 --> 01:23:45,180
She's back.

1056
01:23:45,213 --> 01:23:46,715
I believe she's back.

1057
01:23:46,748 --> 01:23:48,483
Is she with someone?

1058
01:23:48,516 --> 01:23:50,719
No, I think she's
talking to herself again.

1059
01:23:50,752 --> 01:23:52,287
Hello, Clementine.

1060
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,589
Fanny. Are you well?

1061
01:23:54,623 --> 01:23:56,424
Did you have any trouble?

1062
01:23:56,458 --> 01:23:58,827
Trouble? What kind of trouble?

1063
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:00,462
With your foreign friends.

1064
01:24:00,495 --> 01:24:02,364
Because we often
ask ourselves,

1065
01:24:02,397 --> 01:24:04,866
"Why would Dr. Binnie waste
her time and intelligence

1066
01:24:04,899 --> 01:24:07,769
"studying the ways of others
instead of upholding our own?"

1067
01:24:07,802 --> 01:24:10,472
Embarrassed by
our British culture, are we?

1068
01:24:10,505 --> 01:24:11,606
No. No.

1069
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:14,175
I am rather more likely
to be embarrassed by anybody

1070
01:24:14,209 --> 01:24:16,711
reflexly frightened
of anybody different.

1071
01:24:16,745 --> 01:24:17,846
What exactly are you saying?

1072
01:24:17,879 --> 01:24:19,614
She's calling us bigots.

1073
01:24:19,648 --> 01:24:20,482
Your word, not mine.

1074
01:24:20,515 --> 01:24:21,583
You misunderstand.

1075
01:24:21,616 --> 01:24:23,151
- Oh?
- It's not how they look, dear.

1076
01:24:23,184 --> 01:24:24,619
It's how they live.
What they believe.

1077
01:24:24,653 --> 01:24:26,388
- What they eat.
- What are you on about?

1078
01:24:26,421 --> 01:24:28,223
Everywhere one goes, ethnics.

1079
01:24:28,256 --> 01:24:31,226
We are being overwhelmed,
and we're inviting our doom.

1080
01:24:31,259 --> 01:24:32,460
It's not natural.

1081
01:24:32,494 --> 01:24:34,696
Birds belong in the air.
Fish belong in the sea.

1082
01:24:34,729 --> 01:24:36,798
And that is how the good Lord
meant us to be.

1083
01:24:36,831 --> 01:24:39,035
You're just spouting rubbish
from start to finish.

1084
01:24:39,068 --> 01:24:40,602
It's science.
It's a scientific fact.

1085
01:24:40,635 --> 01:24:41,736
It's a false analogy.

1086
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:44,106
I mean, animals do have
a natural habitat.

1087
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:46,307
It's true,
but human beings are capable

1088
01:24:46,341 --> 01:24:48,443
of living in any environment
they bloody well choose.

1089
01:24:48,476 --> 01:24:49,678
That's not a fact.

1090
01:24:49,711 --> 01:24:51,312
- What are you saying?
- It's an opinion.

1091
01:24:51,346 --> 01:24:52,447
And you're wrong.

1092
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,016
I'm not putting up
with any more of this.

1093
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:56,251
Come away, Clem.
Let the crazy lady be.

1094
01:24:56,284 --> 01:24:57,952
We're never gonna get
any sense out of her.

1095
01:24:57,986 --> 01:25:00,588
You know, I've never
said this to you before.

1096
01:25:01,123 --> 01:25:03,525
But you're both pitiful.

1097
01:25:03,558 --> 01:25:04,926
Shut your cakehole!

1098
01:25:04,959 --> 01:25:07,462
Pea-brained and pitiful.

1099
01:25:08,030 --> 01:25:10,231
You, fuckface!

1100
01:25:10,265 --> 01:25:14,369
Stop your ivy growing
on our side of the wall!

1101
01:25:15,336 --> 01:25:17,472
Why do I let them get to me?

1102
01:25:17,505 --> 01:25:19,574
I should feel sorry for them.

1103
01:25:19,607 --> 01:25:22,977
But this is my home.
It's my sanctuary.

1104
01:25:26,848 --> 01:25:29,250
I could wish them...

1105
01:25:30,119 --> 01:25:32,320
That's not a wish, by the way.

1106
01:25:32,353 --> 01:25:33,722
I know.

1107
01:27:37,412 --> 01:27:38,780
My djinn.

1108
01:27:39,681 --> 01:27:40,882
How was your day?

1109
01:27:40,915 --> 01:27:43,285
Every listening ear
was yours.

1110
01:27:43,319 --> 01:27:46,088
Every voice, every scent,
and touch.

1111
01:27:46,121 --> 01:27:47,789
You were everywhere.

1112
01:27:53,095 --> 01:27:54,729
Back in a minute.

1113
01:28:13,648 --> 01:28:15,750
Whoever could that be
at this hour?

1114
01:28:15,783 --> 01:28:16,985
It could be her.

1115
01:28:20,356 --> 01:28:23,424
Clem. Fanny.

1116
01:28:25,327 --> 01:28:27,929
Chickpeas, cloves, pistachio.

1117
01:28:29,631 --> 01:28:31,466
They melt in your mouth.

1118
01:28:49,318 --> 01:28:50,952
This is my friend.

1119
01:28:52,154 --> 01:28:53,988
He'll be staying for a while.

1120
01:28:54,956 --> 01:28:55,957
Hello.

1121
01:28:59,094 --> 01:29:00,795
- Hello.
- Hello.

1122
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:06,668
<i>My Djinn told me,</i>

1123
01:29:06,701 --> 01:29:09,637
<i>when they come together
in the Realm of Djinn,</i>

1124
01:29:09,671 --> 01:29:11,572
<i>they tell each other stories.</i>

1125
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:14,909
<i>Stories are like
breath to them.</i>

1126
01:29:14,943 --> 01:29:15,977
<i>They make meaning.</i>

1127
01:29:17,979 --> 01:29:19,181
<i>"Yes," I said.</i>

1128
01:29:19,214 --> 01:29:20,982
<i>"That's just how
it is with us."</i>

1129
01:29:21,883 --> 01:29:23,618
<i>Each story we tell
is a fragment</i>

1130
01:29:23,651 --> 01:29:26,188
<i>in an endless
shape-shifting mosaic.</i>

1131
01:29:27,622 --> 01:29:31,893
<i>And this small pebble,
like all stories, must end.</i>

1132
01:29:33,728 --> 01:29:37,032
<i>If it's about wishing,
it's a cautionary tale.</i>

1133
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:41,136
<i>So, how will it go wrong?</i>

1134
01:29:41,170 --> 01:29:43,638
<i>Perhaps, it already has.</i>

1135
01:29:46,841 --> 01:29:49,311
Even though Truth
stood before them naked,

1136
01:29:49,345 --> 01:29:50,945
they turned their backs.

1137
01:29:50,979 --> 01:29:55,483
So, Truth moved to the side
and waited in the shadows.

1138
01:29:55,516 --> 01:29:56,951
<i>In the days that followed,</i>

1139
01:29:56,985 --> 01:30:00,621
<i>the Djinn would accompany
the narratologist to her work.</i>

1140
01:30:00,655 --> 01:30:02,024
<i>And when he wasn't with her,</i>

1141
01:30:02,057 --> 01:30:05,493
<i>he would go in eager
exploration of the world.</i>

1142
01:30:08,263 --> 01:30:11,532
<i>Today I had
such a marvelous day.</i>

1143
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:15,670
<i>I saw many things.</i>

1144
01:30:15,703 --> 01:30:19,807
<i>I watched a human look into
the living brain of another</i>

1145
01:30:19,841 --> 01:30:22,610
<i>and arrest a fatal bleeding.</i>

1146
01:30:27,149 --> 01:30:28,850
<i>I visited the Collider.</i>

1147
01:30:30,019 --> 01:30:34,622
<i>A vast gizmo which probed
the essence of matter.</i>

1148
01:30:37,625 --> 01:30:40,862
<i>And then I saw a dish,
a great dish</i>

1149
01:30:40,895 --> 01:30:44,699
<i>that listens to the whispers
of stars long dead.</i>

1150
01:30:46,934 --> 01:30:48,703
Humankind is...

1151
01:30:48,736 --> 01:30:50,772
is a wonder, Alithea.

1152
01:30:51,539 --> 01:30:53,941
I'm happy you think so.

1153
01:30:53,975 --> 01:30:57,046
All of this since I was
trapped in Zefir's bottle.

1154
01:30:57,079 --> 01:31:02,017
All these astonishments,
in less than 200 years.

1155
01:31:02,051 --> 01:31:03,818
Yes, but, I mean,

1156
01:31:03,851 --> 01:31:08,323
that's just engineering
and technology.

1157
01:31:08,357 --> 01:31:10,758
Despite all the whiz-bang,

1158
01:31:10,792 --> 01:31:13,028
we remain bewildered.

1159
01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:17,932
When we can't
contain the chaos,

1160
01:31:19,567 --> 01:31:22,337
we are filled
with dread and panic,

1161
01:31:22,371 --> 01:31:24,440
and we turn on each other.

1162
01:31:24,473 --> 01:31:27,176
But of course, you are human.

1163
01:31:27,209 --> 01:31:29,244
That is your nature.

1164
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:35,050
Yeah. So, the story
never changes.

1165
01:31:36,051 --> 01:31:38,520
Hate prevails.

1166
01:31:38,554 --> 01:31:43,258
It metastasizes
and outlives love.

1167
01:31:44,926 --> 01:31:47,595
I just want
to talk about love.

1168
01:31:47,628 --> 01:31:51,632
Such a mess
of contradictions,
all of you.

1169
01:31:51,666 --> 01:31:52,767
Thank you very much.

1170
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:56,238
Humankind,
what a conundrum.

1171
01:31:56,271 --> 01:31:58,806
You fumble around in the dark,

1172
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:02,144
and yet, you herd your
intelligence to great effect.

1173
01:32:02,177 --> 01:32:03,579
It is quite a story.

1174
01:32:04,879 --> 01:32:07,715
Cannot wait to see
where it goes.

1175
01:32:07,748 --> 01:32:09,817
Or how it might end.

1176
01:32:10,219 --> 01:32:11,719
That too.

1177
01:32:11,752 --> 01:32:15,690
A mortal will never know,
but a djinn might.

1178
01:32:15,723 --> 01:32:18,293
A djinn has all the time
in the world.

1179
01:32:20,462 --> 01:32:22,464
Aren't you the lucky one?

1180
01:32:22,498 --> 01:32:23,965
Maybe.

1181
01:32:24,866 --> 01:32:28,270
But you creatures
of dust have...

1182
01:32:28,303 --> 01:32:29,637
have managed to eclipse

1183
01:32:29,670 --> 01:32:33,175
the power and purpose
of djinn and angel.

1184
01:32:33,208 --> 01:32:35,377
You have no use for us.

1185
01:32:35,410 --> 01:32:36,578
Perhaps, we will wither and...

1186
01:32:36,612 --> 01:32:38,080
- And fade away?
- Yes.

1187
01:32:38,113 --> 01:32:40,549
Yeah. Well, that used
to be the subject

1188
01:32:40,582 --> 01:32:42,650
of all my lectures and papers.

1189
01:32:42,683 --> 01:32:44,086
I know.

1190
01:32:46,588 --> 01:32:48,423
And yet, here you are.

1191
01:32:50,225 --> 01:32:52,227
My impossible.

1192
01:32:54,229 --> 01:32:55,230
Yes.

1193
01:33:07,543 --> 01:33:08,843
Hello?

1194
01:33:14,349 --> 01:33:15,917
I'm home!

1195
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:27,162
Hello?

1196
01:33:53,288 --> 01:33:54,789
Djinn?

1197
01:33:58,694 --> 01:33:59,860
My love?

1198
01:34:04,099 --> 01:34:05,100
Djinn.

1199
01:34:09,371 --> 01:34:10,472
What's this?

1200
01:34:13,175 --> 01:34:14,942
Can you hear me?

1201
01:34:14,976 --> 01:34:17,312
Djinn, speak to me.

1202
01:34:17,346 --> 01:34:18,846
Try to speak to me.

1203
01:34:20,682 --> 01:34:22,984
I wish you to speak to me.

1204
01:34:27,055 --> 01:34:28,056
Oh...

1205
01:34:42,870 --> 01:34:44,872
I was sleeping.

1206
01:34:44,905 --> 01:34:47,242
Sleeping.

1207
01:34:48,876 --> 01:34:50,978
Djinn don't sleep.

1208
01:34:51,013 --> 01:34:52,481
Let's go
for a walk.

1209
01:34:52,514 --> 01:34:53,749
A long, bracing walk.

1210
01:34:53,781 --> 01:34:55,317
I have prepared
something for us.

1211
01:34:55,350 --> 01:34:56,951
I have it all planned.

1212
01:34:56,984 --> 01:34:59,321
A wonderous night for us.

1213
01:34:59,354 --> 01:35:01,290
It will be amazing.

1214
01:35:01,323 --> 01:35:04,092
- The best time of our lives.
- Stop!

1215
01:35:04,126 --> 01:35:08,430
These electromagnetic fields,
I can push them from my head.

1216
01:35:08,463 --> 01:35:09,997
I can push them away.

1217
01:35:10,931 --> 01:35:12,334
We'll go for a picnic.

1218
01:35:17,072 --> 01:35:19,408
Ah, we'll play the ukulele.

1219
01:35:21,809 --> 01:35:25,280
Alithea, there is a place
for me here.

1220
01:35:25,314 --> 01:35:26,248
These forces,

1221
01:35:26,281 --> 01:35:28,050
they will never go away,
not from this world.

1222
01:35:28,083 --> 01:35:30,252
I will overcome them.
I can do that for you.

1223
01:35:30,285 --> 01:35:32,421
You are my Alithea,
and I love you.

1224
01:35:32,454 --> 01:35:34,222
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you for trying.

1225
01:35:34,256 --> 01:35:35,524
You don't think
that I love you?

1226
01:35:36,658 --> 01:35:38,660
Love is a gift.

1227
01:35:38,694 --> 01:35:41,063
It's a gift of oneself
given freely.

1228
01:35:41,096 --> 01:35:43,432
It's not something
one can ever ask for.

1229
01:35:44,832 --> 01:35:46,034
I tricked us both.

1230
01:35:46,068 --> 01:35:47,736
The moment I spoke that wish,

1231
01:35:47,769 --> 01:35:50,838
I took away
your power to grant it.

1232
01:35:50,871 --> 01:35:55,077
I, more than anybody,
I should've known that.

1233
01:35:55,110 --> 01:35:57,245
I'm not going
to screw this up again.

1234
01:35:57,279 --> 01:36:01,416
My Djinn, if this world
is not for you,

1235
01:36:01,450 --> 01:36:04,453
I wish that you return
to where you belong.

1236
01:36:05,354 --> 01:36:07,356
Wherever that may be.

1237
01:38:34,736 --> 01:38:35,737
Mommy!

1238
01:38:37,806 --> 01:38:39,808
Come here, little monkey.

1239
01:38:39,841 --> 01:38:41,443
That's not Mommy.

1240
01:40:09,230 --> 01:40:10,432
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Ah, no!

1241
01:40:10,465 --> 01:40:12,634
Watch it.
Top striker in the league.

1242
01:40:21,643 --> 01:40:23,111
Did you see that?

1243
01:40:26,114 --> 01:40:28,683
<i>He would visit
from time to time,</i>

1244
01:40:28,717 --> 01:40:32,187
<i>and they would grasp
each vivid moment.</i>

1245
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:35,123
<i>Despite the pain
of the raucous skies,</i>

1246
01:40:35,156 --> 01:40:37,926
<i>he always stayed
longer than he should,</i>

1247
01:40:37,959 --> 01:40:40,261
<i>long after
she begged him to leave.</i>

1248
01:40:41,262 --> 01:40:44,432
<i>He promised to return
in her lifetime,</i>

1249
01:40:44,466 --> 01:40:47,602
<i>and for her,
that was more than enough.</i>
