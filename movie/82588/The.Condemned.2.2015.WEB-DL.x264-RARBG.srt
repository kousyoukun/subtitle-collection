00:00:39,612 --> 00:00:43,181
Welcome, everyone!

3
00:00:44,183 --> 00:00:46,318
Tonight,

4
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,520
I have something very special.

5
00:01:21,593 --> 00:01:23,560
For years,

6
00:01:23,562 --> 00:01:26,796
I have entertained all of you.

7
00:01:26,798 --> 00:01:29,466
- Have I not?
- Yes.

8
00:01:29,468 --> 00:01:31,367
And some of you,

9
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:34,404
I have made very rich.

10
00:01:34,406 --> 00:01:36,305
Hell, yeah.

11
00:01:36,307 --> 00:01:40,542
Some have made me
a little richer.

12
00:01:41,645 --> 00:01:46,849
- Time to place your bets.
- Yeah.

13
00:01:46,851 --> 00:01:48,750
The videos. What do you
think you are doing?

14
00:01:50,953 --> 00:01:52,788
It was my idea.

15
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,224
You will not make a move
unless I say.

16
00:01:58,728 --> 00:01:59,761
Understood?

17
00:02:06,236 --> 00:02:07,502
Then let's begin.

18
00:02:07,504 --> 00:02:08,769
Yeah!

19
00:02:45,913 --> 00:02:47,613
God, I hate this place.

20
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:49,481
I'm freezing my balls off
out here.

21
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:53,419
Don't worry about the cold,
worry about the snakes.

22
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:54,920
Great, I hate snakes.

23
00:02:56,722 --> 00:02:58,023
Full gear, boss?

24
00:02:58,025 --> 00:02:59,557
Yeah.
All right, listen up, guys.

25
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:01,999
We're on the clock.
Harrigan, how far?

26
00:03:02,426 --> 00:03:03,927
Right, just over
this ridge line,

27
00:03:03,929 --> 00:03:05,895
we got about two hours' slot.

28
00:03:10,868 --> 00:03:14,109
Hey, Michaels, do everybody a favor
and don't shoot yourself this time.

29
00:03:17,742 --> 00:03:20,577
Check your comms.

30
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,813
Cooper, what're you doing? No
incendiaries, not necessary.

31
00:03:22,815 --> 00:03:24,581
Oh, come on.
How about a smoke, boss?

32
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,416
Everyone likes a little smoke.

33
00:03:30,655 --> 00:03:32,389
We do this fast.

34
00:03:32,391 --> 00:03:34,492
Get the package, get out.
Simple snatch-and-grab.

35
00:03:34,494 --> 00:03:36,760
Target is Cyrus Merrick, 61,

36
00:03:36,762 --> 00:03:38,561
<i>wanted for extortion,
illegal gambling,</i>

37
00:03:38,563 --> 00:03:40,330
attempted murder...
The list goes on.

38
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:42,493
What's the bounty?
You know what it is.

39
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:46,734
Half a million.

40
00:03:50,004 --> 00:03:52,039
Deadly force is not
an option, boys.

41
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,440
If we kill him,
we don't get paid.

42
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:55,708
So, aim for the knees.

43
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,343
Got it? Yeah.

44
00:04:07,454 --> 00:04:08,988
Let's grab that payday.

45
00:04:14,027 --> 00:04:18,998
Once I inject the drug,
we will start the clock.

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,403
Yeah! I have pulled these two
homeless men off the streets.

47
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:25,037
No one knows they're here,

48
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:27,673
and no one will ever miss them.

49
00:05:03,014 --> 00:05:05,749
Lange, you're point.
Let's move out.

50
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:06,649
Copy.

51
00:05:31,008 --> 00:05:32,541
Cooper, Michaels, with me.

52
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,144
Harrigan, Lange,
to the right. Travis,

53
00:05:35,146 --> 00:05:37,387
<i>get up on top of this truck
and provide some cover.</i>

54
00:05:38,114 --> 00:05:39,615
On me.

55
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:04,139
Bargain is 1,000.

56
00:06:04,141 --> 00:06:09,111
Which one will die first?
And how long will it take?

57
00:07:06,238 --> 00:07:07,972
Hey, what you doing?

58
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:09,708
Hey, stop it.

59
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,110
Hey, there's not supposed to
be any operations right now.

60
00:07:12,112 --> 00:07:13,845
Would you get
get out of that thing.

61
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:35,034
Don't kill them.
The legs. Aim for the legs.

62
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:46,711
Oh, shit.

63
00:08:01,989 --> 00:08:03,056
Let's go.

64
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:07,793
Come on,
let him die, let him die.

65
00:08:21,808 --> 00:08:25,209
Bail enforcement. Everybody on the
ground, hands behind your backs.

66
00:08:28,747 --> 00:08:32,049
Get the laptop, wipe the hard
drives and meet me outside.

67
00:08:32,051 --> 00:08:35,253
Cyrus Merrick, you are wanted
for illegal gambling, extortion

68
00:08:35,255 --> 00:08:37,655
and attempted murder.
You're coming with us.

69
00:08:38,924 --> 00:08:40,090
Fuck you.

70
00:08:46,097 --> 00:08:47,163
11 o'clock!

71
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:53,970
It's over, Cyrus. Come with us,
and make it easy on yourself.

72
00:08:53,972 --> 00:08:57,674
Easy? Nothing in this life
is easy, bounty hunter.

73
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,032
What have you done, Will?

74
00:09:52,034 --> 00:09:53,954
How are we going to explain
this to the cops?

75
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:55,866
I understand
a deal has been struck

76
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:59,136
between the defendant
and the prosecution.

77
00:10:59,138 --> 00:11:02,619
Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Tanner has
changed his plea to guilty.

78
00:11:03,275 --> 00:11:04,441
Will Tanner.

79
00:11:07,545 --> 00:11:10,447
You've been found guilty
of involuntary manslaughter

80
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:13,416
and are hereby sentenced
to two years suspended

81
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:15,285
and five years' probation
to commence

82
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:18,354
at the end of your suspended
sentence period.

83
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:21,491
Mr. Tanner,
I don't like bounty hunters.

84
00:11:22,526 --> 00:11:24,527
We have police for a reason.

85
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:27,964
Trained professionals whose job
it is to go after the bad guys,

86
00:11:27,966 --> 00:11:30,533
not gun-toting cowboys.

87
00:11:30,535 --> 00:11:33,203
You so much as spit
on my sidewalk,

88
00:11:33,205 --> 00:11:34,370
and I will happily
throw your ass

89
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:35,571
in prison for
the full two years.

90
00:11:35,573 --> 00:11:36,872
Am I clear?

91
00:11:36,874 --> 00:11:38,406
Yes, Your Honor.

92
00:11:38,408 --> 00:11:40,529
I don't want to see you
in here again.

93
00:11:42,277 --> 00:11:44,037
I am done with that life,
Your Honor.

94
00:11:45,213 --> 00:11:46,493
We are adjourned.

95
00:12:18,082 --> 00:12:20,884
Dad. Hey, Dad!

96
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:43,239
Hey, Dad.

97
00:12:46,877 --> 00:12:47,910
Will?

98
00:12:49,312 --> 00:12:51,180
Yeah, hand me a 3/16.

99
00:13:03,094 --> 00:13:05,574
So, they didn't lock
you up after all, huh?

100
00:13:07,063 --> 00:13:08,263
No, I took a plea.

101
00:13:08,265 --> 00:13:10,532
You took a plea. You gave up.

102
00:13:13,102 --> 00:13:15,237
I killed a man, Dad.

103
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:18,759
He was a criminal. Piece of shit murderer.
You could've beat that.

104
00:13:20,242 --> 00:13:22,677
Yeah. If I keep my nose clean,

105
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,612
I don't have to do any time.

106
00:13:24,614 --> 00:13:27,615
I got off easy. Easy?

107
00:13:31,286 --> 00:13:33,588
Easy?

108
00:13:35,123 --> 00:13:37,023
Yeah, you got off easy.

109
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:43,562
What about the family business?

110
00:13:43,564 --> 00:13:46,966
It took me 30 years to build it.

111
00:13:46,968 --> 00:13:49,968
You and that band of idiots, took
you 10 minutes to tear it down.

112
00:13:51,271 --> 00:13:53,538
I'm sorry. Sorry?

113
00:13:56,576 --> 00:13:58,857
Sorry ain't gonna give
me back my reputation, boy.

114
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,150
Listen, Dad, I came here to tell
you that I can't do this anymore.

115
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:08,053
I'm out, Dad.

116
00:14:09,623 --> 00:14:13,025
You came here
to tell me you're out?

117
00:14:17,997 --> 00:14:20,357
I give my boy
the family business,

118
00:14:22,268 --> 00:14:23,734
and he just pisses it away.

119
00:14:29,974 --> 00:14:32,376
Yeah, I should have
known better.

120
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:52,098
- Ah, here we go.
- Thanks, Pop.

121
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,860
Got it? Yeah.

122
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,675
You know, Dad, all I want
in life is peace and quiet.

123
00:15:02,677 --> 00:15:06,044
Just... No guns, no fugitives.

124
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,314
Right, right, right.

125
00:15:10,749 --> 00:15:13,283
You never had
what it takes, Will.

126
00:15:13,285 --> 00:15:16,453
Too soft.
Too much like your mother.

127
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:21,258
God, I miss that woman.
Every goddamn day.

128
00:16:41,684 --> 00:16:43,518
Hey, Danni.

129
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,887
So you got something for me.

130
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:46,569
She's not pretty,
but she does the job.

131
00:16:47,823 --> 00:16:51,593
Or has done, right?
Yeah, I got it.

132
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:53,795
Sorry the pay's not better.
Tough times, you know?

133
00:16:53,797 --> 00:16:55,463
Yeah. Tell me about it.

134
00:17:01,904 --> 00:17:04,439
So, this place still your dad's?

135
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:05,681
I actually own it with him now.

136
00:17:06,141 --> 00:17:07,241
Oh. Look at you.

137
00:17:09,144 --> 00:17:11,264
All right, go ahead
and check her out.

138
00:17:11,278 --> 00:17:12,478
All right.

139
00:17:22,155 --> 00:17:24,789
She capable of towing anything?

140
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,223
You're just gonna have to
find out for yourself.

141
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:28,392
Fair enough.

142
00:17:32,497 --> 00:17:33,597
Oh.

143
00:17:36,367 --> 00:17:37,900
Not too shabby, right?

144
00:17:37,902 --> 00:17:41,671
Ah, you know what, Danni? I
think she'll work just fine.

145
00:17:41,673 --> 00:17:43,633
I am going to put you on
top of the overtime list.

146
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:48,345
I don't know what to say.
Thanks, Danni.

147
00:17:48,347 --> 00:17:50,388
I appreciate it. No problem.

148
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,790
So, uh, Danni,
I'll wait for your call.

149
00:18:53,285 --> 00:18:54,852
<i>Will, come in.</i>

150
00:18:56,288 --> 00:18:57,955
Hey, Danni, go ahead.

151
00:18:57,957 --> 00:18:59,957
<i>We got a breakdown
on the Interstate.</i>

152
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:01,391
<i>Go to bunker 40.</i>

153
00:19:03,261 --> 00:19:04,894
About 10 minutes off, Danni.

154
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:20,777
Call for a tow?

155
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:23,679
Will... Michaels?

156
00:19:23,681 --> 00:19:26,382
How you been, man? I'm good.

157
00:19:26,384 --> 00:19:28,585
Well, I'm stuck in the
middle of nowhere, but good.

158
00:19:28,852 --> 00:19:30,285
So, what's going on?

159
00:19:30,287 --> 00:19:32,988
Ah. It just died on me.

160
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,823
I'll tell you what, do me
a favor, jump in there,

161
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:36,925
turn it over for me
and I'll see what's up.

162
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:43,965
I think I see the problem.

163
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:46,088
Sit tight. I'll be right back.

164
00:20:05,724 --> 00:20:07,325
Go ahead and try it now.

165
00:20:10,463 --> 00:20:11,662
Thought the battery was dead,

166
00:20:11,664 --> 00:20:13,624
but one of the contacts
was loose.

167
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:16,700
You're good to go. Thanks.

168
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:21,905
Look, I passed a little
cantina maybe a mile back.

169
00:20:21,907 --> 00:20:24,874
Buy you a cold one
for old time's sake?

170
00:20:24,876 --> 00:20:28,197
Are you kidding me? Let's do it.
I'll see you over there.

171
00:20:48,835 --> 00:20:51,077
Thank you. Mmm-hmm.

172
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,681
Check that out, Michaels.

173
00:21:02,683 --> 00:21:04,783
- You see it?
- Just a drone.

174
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,057
Oh, they're everywhere
these days. They're kids.

175
00:21:18,997 --> 00:21:23,567
Hey, you okay?
Yeah, yeah. No, I'm fine.

176
00:21:25,736 --> 00:21:27,003
You don't look okay.

177
00:21:27,005 --> 00:21:28,604
What's going on?

178
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,690
What the hell's going on?

179
00:21:52,194 --> 00:21:53,894
I have to kill you, Will.

180
00:22:01,969 --> 00:22:03,837
Stay down. Just stay down.
Stay down.

181
00:22:12,013 --> 00:22:13,113
He's coming around here.

182
00:22:29,731 --> 00:22:31,973
What the fuck you doing, man?

183
00:22:49,752 --> 00:22:50,953
Why are you doing this?

184
00:22:50,955 --> 00:22:52,754
I don't want to, I have to.

185
00:22:52,756 --> 00:22:54,196
Or they'll kill me
and my sister.

186
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,164
Who's gonna kill your sister?

187
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,598
Who threatened you?

188
00:23:13,109 --> 00:23:15,111
Who threatened your sister?
Talk to me.

189
00:23:15,113 --> 00:23:17,813
Don't. Don't do it. Stop!

190
00:23:29,025 --> 00:23:31,526
Michaels. Michaels!

191
00:24:10,968 --> 00:24:14,071
So, the victim, Ryan Michaels,

192
00:24:14,073 --> 00:24:16,206
he didn't want to kill you,
but he was trying to kill you.

193
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,575
I know how it sounds, Officer.

194
00:24:18,577 --> 00:24:19,809
But it was self-defense.

195
00:24:19,811 --> 00:24:21,912
You can ask anybody in there.

196
00:24:21,914 --> 00:24:24,781
Friends don't try to kill
each other for no reason.

197
00:24:24,783 --> 00:24:27,017
Now, you've been convicted of manslaughter.
That right, Mr. Tanner?

198
00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:28,351
That has nothing to do with this.
Answer the question.

199
00:24:29,086 --> 00:24:30,719
Yeah.

200
00:24:32,355 --> 00:24:34,255
I compared the story and

201
00:24:34,257 --> 00:24:36,223
the waitress has video...

202
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:39,093
Okay. Can you take her inside?

203
00:24:39,095 --> 00:24:41,061
Am I being charged? No.

204
00:24:42,696 --> 00:24:44,597
Witnesses confirmed your story.

205
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,298
You're free to go. For now.

206
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,266
Don't leave the state.

207
00:24:48,268 --> 00:24:50,068
A man died here, Mr. Tanner.

208
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,303
Someone's gotta pay for that.

209
00:24:52,305 --> 00:24:53,604
- Yes, Officer.
- All right.

210
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:05,249
<i>You can't stay out of trouble for
10 goddamn minutes, can you?</i>

211
00:25:05,251 --> 00:25:09,621
He comes out of nowhere. "Hey,
how you doing?" And then "Boom!"

212
00:25:09,623 --> 00:25:11,823
Tries to whack
you between cervezas?

213
00:25:11,825 --> 00:25:13,391
Seriously. Yeah, I know,
it doesn't make any sense.

214
00:25:13,393 --> 00:25:16,328
No, it doesn't. Why don't you
tell me what's going on.

215
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,296
I don't know. Bullshit.

216
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:21,379
Why don't you try taking my side for once?
I am here, aren't I?

217
00:25:23,803 --> 00:25:27,139
People act out of self-interest,
that's life, true and simple.

218
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:29,975
Now, this friend of yours
tried to blow your head off.

219
00:25:31,644 --> 00:25:33,926
Which means you did something.

220
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,360
What did you do, Will?

221
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:37,181
I don't know.

222
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:39,316
Who the hell is that?

223
00:25:53,232 --> 00:25:55,132
Hey, Will. Lange.

224
00:25:56,802 --> 00:25:59,270
Dad, this is James Lange.
He was part of my team.

225
00:25:59,272 --> 00:26:02,407
Yeah, I remember you. Pretty
good with a gun as I recall.

226
00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:03,741
I can hold my own.

227
00:26:05,176 --> 00:26:06,776
It's good to see you, man.

228
00:26:08,746 --> 00:26:10,186
So, what brings you out
this way?

229
00:26:11,681 --> 00:26:14,216
Well, I heard what happened
with Michaels.

230
00:26:14,218 --> 00:26:16,351
How did you hear?
It happened an hour ago.

231
00:26:16,353 --> 00:26:17,952
Word travels fast, you know.

232
00:26:17,954 --> 00:26:19,253
Show me your hand, shithead.

233
00:26:19,255 --> 00:26:21,122
Asshole's packing.

234
00:26:21,124 --> 00:26:23,057
- I can explain that.
- Okay, okay.

235
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:24,291
Nice and slow.

236
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:27,294
All right.

237
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:32,032
PI. So you're a PI now.

238
00:26:32,034 --> 00:26:34,267
It still doesn't answer
my question.

239
00:26:34,269 --> 00:26:35,901
I have an answer for that, too.
Oh!

240
00:26:35,903 --> 00:26:37,102
Okay. Slow as you
can, little buddy.

241
00:26:37,104 --> 00:26:38,704
I got it.

242
00:26:38,706 --> 00:26:41,707
It's a police scanner.
That's all.

243
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:45,070
They ran your sheet over the air.
I heard the whole thing.

244
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,132
I know why Michaels tried
to kill you, Will.

245
00:26:50,217 --> 00:26:52,451
Take a ride with me.

246
00:26:52,453 --> 00:26:54,853
There's something
I want to show you.

247
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:57,956
Got a bad feeling about this.

248
00:26:57,958 --> 00:27:01,492
Whatever is going on,
you let the cops handle it.

249
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,828
Pop, I know this guy.

250
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,870
Come on, just trust me,
all right? Take it easy.

251
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:09,499
I don't like it.

252
00:27:13,771 --> 00:27:14,737
Come on, let's go.

253
00:27:38,965 --> 00:27:42,867
Did you keep in touch with
Michaels at all? No. No.

254
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,950
We just kind of went
our separate ways, you know?

255
00:27:45,904 --> 00:27:47,471
Yeah.

256
00:27:47,473 --> 00:27:48,405
Until last night.

257
00:27:49,841 --> 00:27:51,107
What, you saw him?

258
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:53,442
Yeah, it turns out we got
something in common.

259
00:27:53,444 --> 00:27:55,110
And what's that?

260
00:27:55,112 --> 00:27:56,474
Somebody threatened to kill us.

261
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,414
Threatened to kill you.

262
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:01,416
What do you...
Who threatened to kill you?

263
00:28:01,418 --> 00:28:04,052
You know, you know, it'll all
make sense when we get there.

264
00:28:04,054 --> 00:28:06,287
Get where? Where are we going?
Where are you taking me?

265
00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:08,290
What you need to worry about
is right here.

266
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,093
Focus on that.
See that red circle?

267
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:17,497
Be there by 5:00,
and then it's over.

268
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:21,420
You're not making any sense.

269
00:28:22,903 --> 00:28:23,836
We're almost there.

270
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:37,083
Michaels was acting
awful strange. Tense.

271
00:28:37,085 --> 00:28:38,485
Looking up everywhere
he was going,

272
00:28:38,487 --> 00:28:40,019
as if he was being watched.

273
00:28:40,021 --> 00:28:41,286
Just like you.

274
00:28:41,288 --> 00:28:43,321
Wish it was different, buddy.

275
00:28:43,323 --> 00:28:45,084
Looks like I haven't got
a choice either.

276
00:29:34,212 --> 00:29:35,545
Give me the tally board.

277
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:48,391
Ladies and gentlemen,

278
00:29:50,995 --> 00:29:52,962
Will Tanner is still alive.

279
00:29:54,532 --> 00:29:56,432
He survived for now.

280
00:29:59,035 --> 00:30:01,569
You gambled. And you lost.

281
00:30:03,272 --> 00:30:05,573
It's time to make a new wager.

282
00:30:05,575 --> 00:30:08,510
When and where he might die.

283
00:30:13,315 --> 00:30:16,151
Ladies and gentlemen,
place your bets!

284
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,196
Lange! What the hell's going on?

285
00:31:26,198 --> 00:31:29,499
Come on, Will. I'll make
it easy on you, buddy.

286
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:31,902
One to the head, I promise.

287
00:32:27,396 --> 00:32:30,231
Lange, stop. Why are
you trying to kill me?

288
00:32:30,233 --> 00:32:34,069
I was just minding my own
business, trying to live my life.

289
00:32:34,071 --> 00:32:36,471
And this shit, your shit,
lands in my lap!

290
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:42,110
Will!

291
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,686
Hot damn!

292
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:02,597
Hey, don't just stand there.
Call 911!

293
00:35:36,337 --> 00:35:39,606
Travis. Oh, shit.

294
00:35:39,608 --> 00:35:41,440
Ah, Jesus.

295
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:48,513
Goddamn son of... He always
did have good instinct.

296
00:36:09,938 --> 00:36:11,070
Ah! God.

297
00:36:36,031 --> 00:36:37,064
Jesus.

298
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,373
Damn!

299
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,487
You! Behind the rocks!

300
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:02,890
Drop the weapon,
and step out now!

301
00:37:02,892 --> 00:37:05,058
No, lady.
Just stay there. Stay there.

302
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,761
Drop the weapon now.
Let me see your hands.

303
00:37:07,763 --> 00:37:09,095
No, no, no.
You don't understand.

304
00:37:09,097 --> 00:37:10,963
There's a shooter behind you
on the ridge.

305
00:37:10,965 --> 00:37:14,100
Throw the weapon out.
Let me see your hands!

306
00:37:14,102 --> 00:37:15,534
I've just been shot.

307
00:37:15,536 --> 00:37:17,669
You need to stay put, okay?

308
00:37:17,671 --> 00:37:21,006
Well, I got a call about a man matching
your description, shot and killed someone.

309
00:37:21,008 --> 00:37:22,974
So, I'm thinking
you're the shooter.

310
00:37:22,976 --> 00:37:26,011
You're wrong. It's not what you think.
You don't understand!

311
00:37:26,013 --> 00:37:27,445
Just stay there.

312
00:37:29,549 --> 00:37:31,883
You have five seconds or a whole
lot of heat is coming your way.

313
00:37:31,885 --> 00:37:34,151
Okay. Nice and easy, okay?

314
00:37:34,153 --> 00:37:36,720
Nice and easy. Put it down.

315
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:42,092
No, no, no. I got to stay here,
and you need to stay there.

316
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:44,662
Listen to me.
You need to stay there.

317
00:37:44,664 --> 00:37:46,163
Listen to what I'm saying,
please!

318
00:37:46,165 --> 00:37:47,731
Don't move.
Don't come any closer.

319
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:48,998
I am going to ask you
to shut up!

320
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,633
Listen to me.

321
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,668
No. Don't come any closer.

322
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,902
Don't. Don't.

323
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:58,641
I'm coming to you.
Stay where you are.

324
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,943
You need to trust me. No, no.

325
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,187
I am going to
apprehend you, sir.

326
00:38:04,814 --> 00:38:05,713
God.

327
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,616
That's on you, Will.

328
00:38:12,853 --> 00:38:15,021
Shit.

329
00:38:20,061 --> 00:38:21,694
Shit.

330
00:39:08,014 --> 00:39:09,948
Get in!

331
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:10,950
Harrigan?

332
00:39:12,251 --> 00:39:13,619
Shit.

333
00:39:14,887 --> 00:39:16,607
Do you want to live
or not? Come on!

334
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,284
- Get in.
- What're you waiting for?

335
00:39:29,032 --> 00:39:30,198
Get in!

336
00:40:45,686 --> 00:40:47,352
What the hell's going on?

337
00:40:47,354 --> 00:40:48,820
Don't I get any brownie
points for saving your life?

338
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:50,789
Why is our old crew
trying to kill me?

339
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:53,725
Easy, big guy. Calm down.

340
00:40:53,727 --> 00:40:56,088
I'll tell you everything I know.

341
00:40:57,996 --> 00:41:00,930
Will...

342
00:41:03,801 --> 00:41:06,335
You so much as twitch wrong,
and I'll snap your neck.

343
00:41:10,374 --> 00:41:12,894
Can we go inside?
I could use a drink.

344
00:41:13,277 --> 00:41:14,644
After you.

345
00:41:31,231 --> 00:41:32,792
You want to tell me
what you know?

346
00:41:36,169 --> 00:41:38,130
Who came at you today? Michaels.

347
00:41:38,905 --> 00:41:41,673
Then, Lange.

348
00:41:41,675 --> 00:41:43,877
And Travis up on the rocks?
Yeah.

349
00:41:49,182 --> 00:41:51,850
A week ago, guess what piece
of shit shows up at my door.

350
00:41:52,918 --> 00:41:53,918
Raul Baccaro.

351
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,042
Baccaro.

352
00:41:56,956 --> 00:41:59,924
<i>Cyrus Merrick's number two?</i>

353
00:41:59,926 --> 00:42:02,367
<i>Well, since you smoked Cyrus,
he got promoted to number one.</i>

354
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:05,796
Worse than Cyrus ever was.

355
00:42:07,266 --> 00:42:09,233
Well, what did he want?

356
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,334
I had to do one thing...

357
00:42:11,736 --> 00:42:13,037
Kill Will Tanner.

358
00:42:23,748 --> 00:42:26,717
All right, gentlemen,
I want you to drink more.

359
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:28,118
And bet a lot more.

360
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,053
Huh? All right.

361
00:42:30,055 --> 00:42:32,389
Hey, it's good to see you.

362
00:42:32,391 --> 00:42:34,431
Where did you get the idea
for all this?

363
00:42:36,293 --> 00:42:40,263
Well, there's this private
event on an island

364
00:42:40,265 --> 00:42:44,301
where they force condemned
men to fight to the death.

365
00:42:44,303 --> 00:42:46,584
I remember. They were shut down.

366
00:42:47,738 --> 00:42:50,006
Fools. Playing for pennies.

367
00:42:51,241 --> 00:42:54,042
Letting everybody participate.

368
00:42:54,044 --> 00:42:57,880
The game of life and death
should be a privilege.

369
00:42:57,882 --> 00:43:01,017
Reserved for the elite.
Like yourself, Alexi.

370
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:03,752
Like all my friends here.

371
00:43:11,728 --> 00:43:13,896
Cyrus always said,

372
00:43:13,898 --> 00:43:16,932
one man's pain
is another man's profit.

373
00:43:18,067 --> 00:43:20,836
And the only way
to ensure profit,

374
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:23,772
is to be the one
bringing the pain.

375
00:43:26,009 --> 00:43:29,878
Raul must have threatened Michaels
and Lange, too. He had to.

376
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,882
Michaels was supposed to
take you out to the arroyo.

377
00:43:32,884 --> 00:43:34,644
Travis and Lange
would be laying in wait.

378
00:43:35,017 --> 00:43:36,517
You too.

379
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:38,486
Yeah, I played along.

380
00:43:38,488 --> 00:43:42,356
The men here are responsible
for killing Cyrus.

381
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:46,126
Cooper, Harrigan, Michaels,

382
00:43:47,495 --> 00:43:50,097
Travis, Lange...

383
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:53,233
Will.

384
00:43:53,235 --> 00:43:56,469
I only found it fitting
that they be our contestants.

385
00:43:58,138 --> 00:44:00,940
What is that word? Oh, yeah.

386
00:44:02,275 --> 00:44:04,942
Karma.

387
00:44:07,513 --> 00:44:08,412
You all enjoy.

388
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,331
Lange, he... He gave me this.

389
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:18,788
He said I had to
be here by 5:00.

390
00:44:19,557 --> 00:44:20,837
What does that mean?

391
00:44:22,025 --> 00:44:25,061
Raul said if you get here,
you get to live.

392
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:28,797
The arroyo
was just a starting point.

393
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,532
Along the way? Open season.

394
00:44:32,235 --> 00:44:33,902
Only way out of this
is to go to the cops.

395
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,970
Tell them about Raul.

396
00:44:35,972 --> 00:44:37,814
You think the cops
are gonna listen to you?

397
00:44:38,507 --> 00:44:40,074
Michaels is dead.

398
00:44:40,076 --> 00:44:41,208
So is Lange.

399
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:43,010
And now a deputy sheriff.

400
00:44:43,012 --> 00:44:45,145
And the only thing
they have in common is you.

401
00:44:45,147 --> 00:44:47,235
You go to the cops, tell
them what you know.

402
00:44:47,261 --> 00:44:48,348
That backs up my story.

403
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:51,985
And then maybe if we're lucky,
if we're very lucky,

404
00:44:51,987 --> 00:44:55,856
there's proof that Raul threatened Michaels
and Lange, just like he threatened you.

405
00:44:55,858 --> 00:44:57,057
I don't want to shit
on your pillow, boss,

406
00:44:57,059 --> 00:44:59,459
but we've got a couple
of glaring problems.

407
00:44:59,461 --> 00:45:01,028
First, Travis is still out there

408
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:03,231
wanting to put a couple
of extra holes in your head.

409
00:45:19,115 --> 00:45:21,182
Then there's Cooper.

410
00:45:21,184 --> 00:45:23,317
A psycho ex-<i> compadre</i> who likes
burning and blowing shit up.

411
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:26,120
Doesn't mean Cooper's
part of this.

412
00:45:26,122 --> 00:45:27,402
You wanna bet your life on that?

413
00:45:29,023 --> 00:45:30,223
Yeah, I do.

414
00:45:34,062 --> 00:45:36,430
Ladies and gentlemen!

415
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,440
Will Tanner's luck hold on?

416
00:45:40,267 --> 00:45:43,603
Will he survive?

417
00:45:43,605 --> 00:45:49,909
Do any of you have the stones to bet it all
that Tanner will survive my little game?

418
00:45:53,113 --> 00:45:55,148
Ladies and gentlemen,

419
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:56,516
place your bets!

420
00:46:12,134 --> 00:46:13,056
That's funny!

421
00:46:17,106 --> 00:46:18,106
Place your bets!

422
00:46:24,313 --> 00:46:25,474
Let's go.

423
00:46:31,187 --> 00:46:33,227
What? You got a better idea?

424
00:46:33,923 --> 00:46:35,256
Yeah, I do.

425
00:46:52,608 --> 00:46:53,729
Looks brand new.

426
00:46:54,409 --> 00:46:56,544
Raul gave it to me.

427
00:46:56,546 --> 00:46:58,279
It's clean, no serial number.

428
00:46:58,281 --> 00:47:00,082
Was supposed to use it on you.

429
00:47:03,285 --> 00:47:04,685
Glad you didn't.

430
00:47:04,687 --> 00:47:06,586
Don't make me regret that.

431
00:47:10,091 --> 00:47:11,024
What the hell?

432
00:47:28,509 --> 00:47:30,589
Get out! Get out!

433
00:47:43,326 --> 00:47:44,459
Jesus!

434
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:08,384
Oh!

435
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:24,567
Grand on the table, bets all in?

436
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,573
Not yet.

437
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,047
Go, go, go!

438
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:43,620
Shit.

439
00:49:01,741 --> 00:49:03,374
Where is my drone?

440
00:49:03,376 --> 00:49:05,709
Closing in on the target.

441
00:49:05,711 --> 00:49:08,145
Hey, you should be there
when he buys it.

442
00:49:08,147 --> 00:49:10,480
You know, standing over him,
big game hunter-style.

443
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,689
Are you mocking me?

444
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:20,789
Is that what you're doing?

445
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,358
No, I... I would never.

446
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:29,164
Merrick built
his empire on blood.

447
00:49:30,366 --> 00:49:32,868
He fought and scraped

448
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:36,671
to earn the respect of all the
people that worked for him.

449
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:39,574
But I don't.

450
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:42,243
It's five times greater
than anything

451
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:45,680
he would have ever dreamed of.

452
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:49,523
Because I honor something
bigger than respect...

453
00:49:49,551 --> 00:49:50,632
Fear.

454
00:49:51,619 --> 00:49:55,555
Tell me, do you fear me?

455
00:49:57,858 --> 00:49:59,558
Yes, I do.

456
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,841
Good.

457
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:34,261
Not good. Not good.

458
00:50:34,263 --> 00:50:36,544
We're losing power.
I think he hit the engine.

459
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:46,606
Come on. Inside, inside!

460
00:50:46,608 --> 00:50:47,808
Clear out, people!

461
00:50:57,318 --> 00:50:59,252
What? What're you...

462
00:50:59,254 --> 00:51:00,821
Listen, ma'am. We don't
want any trouble, okay?

463
00:51:00,823 --> 00:51:03,590
But there's some asshole
out there with a rifle.

464
00:51:03,592 --> 00:51:06,112
Yeah? And there's a bitch
in here with a shotgun.

465
00:51:06,627 --> 00:51:07,693
Listen. Listen to me, okay?

466
00:51:07,695 --> 00:51:10,562
We go out there,
we're both dead.

467
00:51:10,564 --> 00:51:12,397
Not my problem.

468
00:51:16,836 --> 00:51:18,203
I'm calling the police.

469
00:51:18,705 --> 00:51:19,570
Good!

470
00:51:27,978 --> 00:51:28,858
I'm sorry.

471
00:51:31,582 --> 00:51:32,982
You see Travis?

472
00:51:32,984 --> 00:51:34,683
No, I don't see him.

473
00:51:34,685 --> 00:51:36,652
I know the guy.

474
00:51:36,654 --> 00:51:38,974
He'll take up a position, wait
for us to pop our heads out.

475
00:51:39,822 --> 00:51:41,789
I'm thinking right up there.

476
00:51:41,791 --> 00:51:45,033
Perfect vantage point. He
can cover the entire front.

477
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,528
Take this.

478
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:49,497
Listen, we're sorry
about all this, okay?

479
00:51:49,499 --> 00:51:50,779
Screw you.

480
00:51:53,368 --> 00:51:54,901
Pick up. Pick up.

481
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,669
- Dad.
<i>- You okay, son?</i>

482
00:51:56,671 --> 00:52:00,840
Yeah. Listen, I need your help.

483
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:11,716
Jesus!

484
00:52:21,027 --> 00:52:23,107
Take cover! Protect the girl.

485
00:52:33,507 --> 00:52:34,606
Are you okay? Yeah.

486
00:52:34,608 --> 00:52:35,888
Just stay down!

487
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:40,070
Shit.

488
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:54,592
$10,000. $10,000.

489
00:52:56,061 --> 00:52:57,895
I want mine! Okay.

490
00:53:17,815 --> 00:53:18,882
Gas!

491
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:21,083
Come on!

492
00:53:21,085 --> 00:53:21,950
Come on. Follow me!

493
00:53:22,651 --> 00:53:23,517
Stop, stop, stop!

494
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,087
Come with me.
Keep your head down.

495
00:53:56,089 --> 00:53:57,455
No! Keep your head down.

496
00:53:57,457 --> 00:53:59,023
Stay right here.
You're gonna be safe.

497
00:53:59,025 --> 00:54:01,506
Everything's gonna be all right.
Just keep your head down.

498
00:54:02,027 --> 00:54:04,067
Get into the truck, come on!

499
00:54:14,006 --> 00:54:15,606
No.

500
00:54:15,608 --> 00:54:17,889
Gas, gas, gasoline! Go, go, go!

501
00:54:37,463 --> 00:54:38,863
Dad.

502
00:54:38,865 --> 00:54:39,905
Come on.

503
00:54:42,901 --> 00:54:44,101
Where you been, Dad?

504
00:55:05,155 --> 00:55:07,590
Will, what the hell happened?

505
00:55:07,592 --> 00:55:10,159
Where's Lange? He's dead.
He tried to kill me, too.

506
00:55:10,161 --> 00:55:11,793
Hey, Frank, long time.

507
00:55:15,732 --> 00:55:17,012
Wow.

508
00:55:23,806 --> 00:55:26,108
Fuck! Damn it!

509
00:55:30,713 --> 00:55:32,013
Fuck!

510
00:55:43,826 --> 00:55:45,827
Hey, you wouldn't
happen to have a flask

511
00:55:45,829 --> 00:55:47,528
of something dangerous
on you, would you?

512
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:49,971
As a matter of fact...

513
00:55:51,233 --> 00:55:52,900
Here we go.

514
00:55:52,902 --> 00:55:55,104
You, sir, are still my hero.

515
00:56:24,235 --> 00:56:25,603
That's good, Will.

516
00:56:27,038 --> 00:56:28,705
If all this is true,
we got to call in

517
00:56:28,707 --> 00:56:30,808
the big guns, the Feds, maybe.

518
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:33,877
I got some contacts
we can reach out to in D.C.

519
00:56:33,879 --> 00:56:36,814
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
If all this is true...

520
00:56:36,816 --> 00:56:38,816
How is anybody supposed to
believe me if you don't?

521
00:56:38,818 --> 00:56:41,585
Son, it is a lot to process.

522
00:56:41,587 --> 00:56:44,221
A lot to process? I killed
two people today, Pop.

523
00:56:44,223 --> 00:56:45,622
Try processing that.

524
00:56:45,624 --> 00:56:47,156
Killing a man is hard, I know.

525
00:56:47,158 --> 00:56:48,691
I took over the family business,

526
00:56:48,693 --> 00:56:50,959
tried to make you proud.
I fucked up.

527
00:56:50,961 --> 00:56:52,694
I was done trying
to be like you.

528
00:56:52,696 --> 00:56:54,997
But here I am. My father's son.

529
00:57:10,081 --> 00:57:11,147
Shit. Stop!

530
00:57:20,158 --> 00:57:21,999
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, easy, easy.

531
00:57:23,226 --> 00:57:24,747
Oh, shit. That's close.

532
00:57:25,929 --> 00:57:27,195
Guess who this belongs to?

533
00:57:27,197 --> 00:57:28,262
Cooper.

534
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:33,901
Hey. Check it out.

535
00:57:33,903 --> 00:57:35,983
What do you think?
An invitation?

536
00:57:36,672 --> 00:57:38,005
Yeah. No, thanks.

537
00:57:39,608 --> 00:57:41,040
How about we just get
back in the truck

538
00:57:41,042 --> 00:57:43,043
and we pull a u-ey, and we
get the hell out of here?

539
00:57:43,045 --> 00:57:44,611
A detour.

540
00:57:44,613 --> 00:57:47,146
He's leading us
right into this trap.

541
00:57:47,148 --> 00:57:49,249
You think our good
old buddy Cooper

542
00:57:49,251 --> 00:57:52,118
is just, what, gonna
let us drive away?

543
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,120
Worth a shot.

544
00:57:54,122 --> 00:57:56,404
No, we find Cooper now

545
00:57:56,657 --> 00:57:58,824
and maybe he'll lead us to Raul.

546
00:57:58,826 --> 00:58:01,928
We find Cooper now, and we
get our asses blown to shit.

547
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:02,795
What the...

548
00:58:10,637 --> 00:58:11,803
What the fuck you doing, Dad?

549
00:58:11,805 --> 00:58:13,338
What's it look like?

550
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:15,239
Raul doesn't want
anything to do with you.

551
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,321
He wants a piece of me.
So, you just go home!

552
00:58:18,042 --> 00:58:19,323
Not on your life, son.

553
00:58:28,019 --> 00:58:30,321
Let's go. Huh.

554
00:58:30,323 --> 00:58:31,803
I did not see that comin'.

555
00:58:32,957 --> 00:58:34,023
Hey.

556
00:58:45,904 --> 00:58:47,584
Are you sure we are
in the right place?

557
00:58:49,241 --> 00:58:50,802
What do you think? Yeah.

558
00:58:59,885 --> 00:59:01,687
Come on. Just watch your step.

559
00:59:03,856 --> 00:59:06,017
You know what?
Enough of this shit.

560
00:59:06,659 --> 00:59:08,359
Cooper, I'm here.

561
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:11,661
Show yourself!

562
00:59:11,663 --> 00:59:13,865
You really think it's a
good idea to poke the bear?

563
00:59:15,366 --> 00:59:17,647
Where you at? Come on!

564
00:59:21,304 --> 00:59:22,771
Shit.

565
00:59:22,773 --> 00:59:23,454
Will?

566
00:59:25,108 --> 00:59:27,309
Shit.

567
00:59:27,311 --> 00:59:29,671
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

568
00:59:41,424 --> 00:59:44,693
A foot in diameter. This
is a nasty mine. Okay.

569
00:59:55,739 --> 00:59:58,006
So, you're gonna
slide your foot back.

570
00:59:58,008 --> 00:59:59,374
But whatever you do, don't lift
your foot off that pressure place.

571
00:59:59,376 --> 01:00:01,744
Easy. Easy. Easy.

572
01:00:01,746 --> 01:00:03,112
Just breathe,
be calm, all right?

573
01:00:03,114 --> 01:00:04,394
Nice and slow, on three.

574
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,162
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

575
01:00:07,282 --> 01:00:12,386
On three. One, two...

576
01:00:12,388 --> 01:00:15,389
Easy. Hold up, hold up.
You got it, you got it.

577
01:00:29,973 --> 01:00:31,254
Easy, easy, easy.

578
01:00:33,309 --> 01:00:35,590
Move your foot back
nice and slow.

579
01:00:38,213 --> 01:00:39,947
Thanks. Holy shit.

580
01:00:41,749 --> 01:00:44,310
My money says he's got
this whole canyon rigged.

581
01:00:49,055 --> 01:00:50,121
Oh, shit.

582
01:00:50,123 --> 01:00:50,988
Run!

583
01:01:32,435 --> 01:01:33,796
We're good up here for now.

584
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:36,471
I gonna kill...

585
01:01:36,473 --> 01:01:37,872
You heard me, Cooper?

586
01:01:39,474 --> 01:01:41,408
What happened to
poking the bear?

587
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:43,531
I gonna carve this bear
a new asshole.

588
01:01:46,446 --> 01:01:47,512
He's close.

589
01:01:51,251 --> 01:01:52,691
He likes to admire
his handiwork.

590
01:02:01,361 --> 01:02:02,427
Harrigan.

591
01:02:03,162 --> 01:02:04,228
Back up.

592
01:02:07,166 --> 01:02:08,032
Back up.

593
01:02:38,195 --> 01:02:39,316
God!

594
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:04,386
Cooper?

595
01:03:04,388 --> 01:03:05,668
Get out of the truck!

596
01:03:06,556 --> 01:03:07,677
It's over!

597
01:03:09,057 --> 01:03:11,338
Come on, man,
get out of the truck.

598
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:13,740
Get out of the truck!

599
01:03:22,903 --> 01:03:24,465
You shoot,
I pull the pin as I fall.

600
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,181
Put the gun down.

601
01:03:35,183 --> 01:03:36,550
Come on, Coop.
You don't want to do that.

602
01:03:36,552 --> 01:03:38,151
Put down the grenade.

603
01:03:38,153 --> 01:03:40,586
No. I don't work
for you anymore.

604
01:03:40,588 --> 01:03:41,988
You can't tell me what to do.

605
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:43,522
It doesn't matter
who you work for.

606
01:03:43,524 --> 01:03:45,123
Put down the grenade. Come on, man.
We don't have to...

607
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:46,206
Ah!

608
01:03:47,258 --> 01:03:48,559
Put the gun down, Will.

609
01:03:50,128 --> 01:03:51,995
No, no, no.

610
01:03:51,997 --> 01:03:54,098
Crazy son of a bitch.
You always were.

611
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:55,966
I am slipping here.
You don't have to...

612
01:03:55,968 --> 01:03:57,167
Whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay,
okay, hey, hey, hey...

613
01:03:57,169 --> 01:03:58,409
Easy, easy.

614
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:00,617
All right, Coop.

615
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:02,651
You win.

616
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,175
No gun.

617
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:08,943
Now it's your turn.

618
01:04:11,346 --> 01:04:12,627
Put down that grenade.

619
01:04:14,215 --> 01:04:16,382
Put down the fucking grenade.

620
01:04:20,287 --> 01:04:21,888
Ha! Motherfucker.

621
01:04:32,132 --> 01:04:33,031
Fuck you!

622
01:04:41,673 --> 01:04:44,234
Cooper. You don't
have to do this!

623
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:47,678
Yes, I... Do!

624
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,981
I know Raul threatened
to kill you.

625
01:04:49,983 --> 01:04:53,217
Yeah. And if it's between you
and me, I choose me every time.

626
01:05:10,569 --> 01:05:11,690
God damn it.

627
01:05:15,106 --> 01:05:16,339
Shit, no way!

628
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:40,197
I said back off.
I said back off.

629
01:05:48,274 --> 01:05:49,607
You don't know
everything that's going on.

630
01:05:49,609 --> 01:05:50,674
- Freeze!
- Just easy, easy, easy.

631
01:05:50,676 --> 01:05:52,075
Hands above your head!

632
01:05:52,077 --> 01:05:53,209
Shit. Great.

633
01:05:59,116 --> 01:06:00,277
Stop!

634
01:06:03,353 --> 01:06:04,633
Slippery little fuck.

635
01:06:13,763 --> 01:06:14,629
Gotcha.

636
01:06:23,472 --> 01:06:24,539
Will?

637
01:06:26,208 --> 01:06:28,108
Will, can you hear me?
Hold on, buddy.

638
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:29,242
Hold on. Easy.

639
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:31,244
Give me a first aid kit.

640
01:06:31,246 --> 01:06:32,345
Holy shit.

641
01:06:34,815 --> 01:06:36,081
Oh, God.

642
01:06:54,668 --> 01:06:55,868
Sucks!

643
01:07:15,124 --> 01:07:16,124
Is he dead?

644
01:07:17,459 --> 01:07:18,526
Closer.

645
01:07:20,595 --> 01:07:22,162
Will.

646
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:23,563
Hang in there, buddy.
Can you hear me?

647
01:07:23,565 --> 01:07:24,726
It's his arm.

648
01:07:28,369 --> 01:07:30,637
<i>Hang in there,
buddy. Will! Hold on.</i>

649
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:32,605
Is Will Tanner dead? Yes or no.

650
01:07:32,607 --> 01:07:33,872
I'm not sure.

651
01:07:33,874 --> 01:07:35,640
Well, find out!

652
01:07:35,642 --> 01:07:37,275
Move the drone closer!

653
01:07:37,277 --> 01:07:38,358
I need to know!

654
01:07:40,278 --> 01:07:41,846
Easy, easy.

655
01:07:44,249 --> 01:07:45,649
It looks like he is still alive.

656
01:07:54,293 --> 01:07:55,826
You're damn lucky.

657
01:07:55,828 --> 01:07:57,828
Wound's a through-and-through.

658
01:07:57,830 --> 01:07:59,529
Bullet missed your vital organs.

659
01:07:59,531 --> 01:08:00,853
These will help with the pain.

660
01:08:01,532 --> 01:08:02,465
You done?

661
01:08:03,733 --> 01:08:05,534
No, he's under arrest.

662
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:07,468
For what?

663
01:08:07,470 --> 01:08:08,710
He's wanted for two murders.

664
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:10,336
Possibly a third.

665
01:08:10,338 --> 01:08:11,670
Jesus!

666
01:08:11,672 --> 01:08:15,408
Honey, I'm home!

667
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:17,610
Hey, there, cowboy.
I got a present for you.

668
01:08:17,612 --> 01:08:19,379
Put that down right now!

669
01:08:20,948 --> 01:08:22,848
What, Cooper, you're back
to finish the job?

670
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:24,950
No. I'm here to help.

671
01:08:28,421 --> 01:08:29,702
Can you walk?

672
01:08:31,258 --> 01:08:32,825
All right.

673
01:08:32,827 --> 01:08:35,661
Hey, you. Stay face down
on the ground.

674
01:08:35,663 --> 01:08:37,184
In fact, you guys
give me a minute.

675
01:08:38,365 --> 01:08:39,231
I got an idea.

676
01:08:46,373 --> 01:08:47,907
What the hell did you just do?

677
01:08:47,909 --> 01:08:50,209
I just bought us some time.

678
01:08:50,211 --> 01:08:52,444
He's bat-shit crazy.
You do realize that, right?

679
01:09:05,226 --> 01:09:07,461
Dead man walking.

680
01:09:07,463 --> 01:09:11,531
Please, Will. Run, hide, bleed.

681
01:09:11,533 --> 01:09:15,802
The longer you live,
the more money I make.

682
01:09:15,804 --> 01:09:18,906
Right up to the moment someone
puts a bullet in your head.

683
01:09:28,416 --> 01:09:29,537
You all right?

684
01:09:33,555 --> 01:09:36,036
They went that way?
Yeah, they went over there.

685
01:09:40,628 --> 01:09:43,263
Why did you come back, Coop?

686
01:09:43,265 --> 01:09:46,745
You saved my life. I figured
might as well return the favor.

687
01:09:47,836 --> 01:09:50,276
Look, man. I didn't
want to do any of this.

688
01:09:50,371 --> 01:09:51,771
Welcome to the club.

689
01:09:51,773 --> 01:09:53,940
How'd they get to you?

690
01:09:53,942 --> 01:09:55,808
A few nights ago,
put a gun in my mouth,

691
01:09:55,810 --> 01:09:57,709
it was either I kill you or
they were gonna kill my...

692
01:09:57,711 --> 01:09:59,978
Hold on. Is that my old man
in the middle of the road?

693
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:01,061
Stop the truck.

694
01:10:07,352 --> 01:10:09,019
Jesus, Will. Have you been shot?

695
01:10:10,054 --> 01:10:11,521
I'm fine, Dad.

696
01:10:11,523 --> 01:10:12,990
What're you doing here?

697
01:10:12,992 --> 01:10:14,424
Well, I found this in my truck.

698
01:10:14,426 --> 01:10:16,325
Where you dropped it.

699
01:10:16,327 --> 01:10:19,629
So I figured this is
where you were headed.

700
01:10:19,631 --> 01:10:22,531
I also figured I owe you a pop in the
mouth for that sucker punch you gave me.

701
01:10:22,533 --> 01:10:25,054
But seeing as how you're all shot up...
Oh, son of a bitch!

702
01:10:26,536 --> 01:10:28,003
Okay. I'll call it square.

703
01:10:28,005 --> 01:10:30,406
Nothing like a father's love.

704
01:10:30,408 --> 01:10:31,707
Going out there is suicide.

705
01:10:31,709 --> 01:10:33,542
Yeah, I know,
but I'm done runnin', Pop.

706
01:10:33,544 --> 01:10:37,013
This Raul wants me.
So, here I come.

707
01:10:37,015 --> 01:10:38,981
<i>I should have believed
you from the beginning.</i>

708
01:10:38,983 --> 01:10:43,453
<i>Listen, I know you say all
your violence is behind you.</i>

709
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:45,755
But if you come across that bastard,
you put his ass in the ground.

710
01:10:45,757 --> 01:10:47,523
You understand me? You got it.

711
01:10:47,525 --> 01:10:49,359
All right. You get in my truck.

712
01:10:49,361 --> 01:10:51,761
This truck's all over
the police scanner.

713
01:10:51,763 --> 01:10:53,597
Dad, listen. I said
you're not part of this.

714
01:10:53,599 --> 01:10:54,631
I am your father, son.

715
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:01,604
Look at that. Here we go.

716
01:11:14,649 --> 01:11:15,649
Fuck!

717
01:11:26,561 --> 01:11:27,761
Put me on the board.

718
01:11:30,565 --> 01:11:32,933
Put me on the board!

719
01:11:32,935 --> 01:11:36,103
Really? If Will Tanner survives,

720
01:11:36,105 --> 01:11:37,871
I won't be able
to cover the line.

721
01:11:37,873 --> 01:11:39,138
And I will lose everything.

722
01:11:43,077 --> 01:11:44,957
Either someone else kills him...

723
01:11:46,546 --> 01:11:47,613
Or I do.

724
01:11:48,481 --> 01:11:49,681
Put it on the board.

725
01:11:51,816 --> 01:11:53,884
Piece of shit.

726
01:11:53,886 --> 01:11:57,520
Son, I'm here to help,
tell me what I can do.

727
01:12:01,459 --> 01:12:02,625
Nice shot.

728
01:12:02,627 --> 01:12:03,492
You know it.

729
01:12:06,029 --> 01:12:07,749
Your old man's kind of a badass.

730
01:12:08,464 --> 01:12:10,765
Yeah, he is.

731
01:12:12,168 --> 01:12:13,729
Now, let's get
the fuck out of here.

732
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:15,736
One more.

733
01:12:15,738 --> 01:12:18,072
Ladies and gentlemen,

734
01:12:18,074 --> 01:12:21,775
get ready to open your wallets for
a major shift in our festivities.

735
01:12:24,713 --> 01:12:28,015
I am now officially
a contestant.

736
01:12:45,001 --> 01:12:47,470
This is it, guys.
This is where the map ends.

737
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:54,910
Last time I wore one of these,

738
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:55,977
things didn't go too well, Pop.

739
01:12:55,979 --> 01:12:58,646
Just put it on.

740
01:12:58,648 --> 01:13:00,849
Okay, we'll recon the area and
see what we're dealing with.

741
01:13:00,851 --> 01:13:01,783
Stay with me.

742
01:13:11,528 --> 01:13:13,888
Come on, Will. Let's go.

743
01:13:14,163 --> 01:13:15,443
Come here.

744
01:13:22,871 --> 01:13:25,473
Raul knows we're coming, Pop.

745
01:13:25,475 --> 01:13:26,907
We'll never catch him
by surprise.

746
01:13:26,909 --> 01:13:28,642
Maybe we'll get lucky.

747
01:13:28,644 --> 01:13:30,911
Yeah, 'cause things
have gone great so far.

748
01:13:30,913 --> 01:13:34,147
Well, it's as good a day
to die as any.

749
01:13:34,149 --> 01:13:35,649
Yeah, don't say shit like that.

750
01:13:35,651 --> 01:13:37,183
- What's wrong with you?
- Will,

751
01:13:37,185 --> 01:13:38,617
it's your rodeo, little buddy.

752
01:13:39,251 --> 01:13:40,584
Make the call.

753
01:13:43,589 --> 01:13:45,589
All right, guys.
Bring it in and listen up.

754
01:13:55,768 --> 01:13:57,635
Men, take out his backup.

755
01:13:57,637 --> 01:14:00,572
Under no circumstances does
anybody fire on Will Tanner.

756
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:02,761
I alone will kill him.

757
01:14:05,009 --> 01:14:06,543
Yeah, Raul!

758
01:14:23,194 --> 01:14:25,896
- Some of you go to the left.
- Some of you go to the right.

759
01:14:25,898 --> 01:14:28,598
Circle around, make sure
these other guys are dead!

760
01:14:40,845 --> 01:14:42,680
Yeah!

761
01:15:22,923 --> 01:15:25,659
Come on, Will. Show yourself.

762
01:15:31,833 --> 01:15:33,133
Where are you, Will?

763
01:15:38,738 --> 01:15:39,738
Will.

764
01:15:40,872 --> 01:15:42,073
Hey there, Will.

765
01:15:42,874 --> 01:15:44,207
Put your rifle down, Travis.

766
01:15:46,176 --> 01:15:47,310
I said put the rifle down.

767
01:15:51,014 --> 01:15:52,314
Don't... Don't do it.

768
01:16:48,912 --> 01:16:49,845
Get down!

769
01:17:17,009 --> 01:17:19,291
All right. Let's go. Go, go, go.

770
01:17:29,323 --> 01:17:31,823
Son of a bitch. Son of a...

771
01:17:33,725 --> 01:17:35,393
Dad! Goddamn son of a...

772
01:18:21,345 --> 01:18:23,213
Here we are.

773
01:18:23,215 --> 01:18:24,280
The final game.

774
01:18:25,415 --> 01:18:26,915
Let's finish this, Raul.

775
01:18:29,352 --> 01:18:31,319
It's 5:00.

776
01:18:31,321 --> 01:18:33,387
I am here. Let's end this.

777
01:18:34,255 --> 01:18:36,390
It's actually 5:03.

778
01:18:36,392 --> 01:18:38,892
But either way, you lose.

779
01:18:44,432 --> 01:18:45,965
Come on, boss!

780
01:19:49,906 --> 01:19:52,340
Actually, I should be
thanking you.

781
01:19:52,342 --> 01:19:53,543
You gave me an opportunity

782
01:19:53,544 --> 01:19:55,410
and I'm just exploiting it.

783
01:20:18,402 --> 01:20:20,136
In there,

784
01:20:20,138 --> 01:20:22,505
high-rollers have been
betting on your life all day.

785
01:20:24,909 --> 01:20:27,043
You're telling me

786
01:20:27,045 --> 01:20:30,313
people are in there
right now betting on me.

787
01:20:30,315 --> 01:20:33,949
Millions and millions.
A game of life and death.

788
01:20:37,154 --> 01:20:38,394
That's correct.

789
01:20:39,989 --> 01:20:42,991
The only kind worth playing.

790
01:20:45,527 --> 01:20:47,027
People gambling on
whether or not

791
01:20:47,029 --> 01:20:48,270
we all kill each other.

792
01:20:49,564 --> 01:20:51,131
That's right.

793
01:20:57,171 --> 01:20:59,239
You're gonna make me a rich man.

794
01:20:59,241 --> 01:21:00,607
You had a good run.

795
01:21:00,609 --> 01:21:02,141
But it's time to cash in.

796
01:21:59,273 --> 01:22:00,773
I had regrets about
killing Cyrus.

797
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,246
You, not so much.

798
01:22:26,634 --> 01:22:28,668
Tanner, you're
a one-man wrecking crew.

799
01:22:28,670 --> 01:22:31,271
You did what half my force
couldn't do.

800
01:22:31,273 --> 01:22:33,306
You should be proud
of this boy here.

801
01:22:33,308 --> 01:22:34,707
Thanks a lot.

802
01:22:34,709 --> 01:22:37,177
Hey, can I call you Will?

803
01:22:37,179 --> 01:22:39,546
You got a job at the Sherriff's
department anytime you need it.

804
01:22:39,548 --> 01:22:41,682
Thanks, Officer.
Thank you, Officer.

805
01:22:47,122 --> 01:22:49,123
You all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.

806
01:22:49,125 --> 01:22:51,058
Will, I've been thinking...

807
01:22:53,062 --> 01:22:55,063
I've been thinking about
coming out of retirement.

808
01:22:55,065 --> 01:22:56,631
Oh, God. Don't say it.

809
01:22:58,334 --> 01:23:00,234
Guys, you all right? We're good?

810
01:23:00,236 --> 01:23:01,568
Always good, boss.

811
01:23:05,106 --> 01:23:06,606
Hear me out.

812
01:23:06,608 --> 01:23:10,476
"Tanner and Son Fugitive
Recovery." What do you think?

813
01:23:10,478 --> 01:23:12,812
I told you, Pop, I'm out. I heard you.
