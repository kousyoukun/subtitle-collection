Man, I hated it over there.

288
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,504
我是说  每条路上都有炸弹
I mean, there's a bomb on every road.

289
00:21:10,505 --> 00:21:12,073
在卡鲁姆没想到的时候打他
Hit Kallum when he didn't expect it.

290
00:21:12,074 --> 00:21:13,007
他们总是这样
They always do.

291
00:21:13,008 --> 00:21:14,808
整个地区一团糟
That whole region is a mess.

292
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:17,078
伊拉克  伊朗  阿富汗
Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan.

293
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,746
嘿  我们做了我们的工作
Hey, we did our job.

294
00:21:18,747 --> 00:21:20,248
你真的认为军队关心
You really think the military cared

295
00:21:20,249 --> 00:21:21,682
关于我们在那里教他们的
about what we taught them over there?

296
00:21:21,683 --> 00:21:22,916
我是说  你呢
I mean, do you?

297
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:24,385
追踪老方法有什么用
What's the use in tracking the old ways

298
00:21:24,386 --> 00:21:26,687
当你有一架能做同样事情的无人机
when you got a drone that can do the same thing?

299
00:21:26,688 --> 00:21:28,256
不  是我们带领他们
No, we were the ones that led them

300
00:21:28,257 --> 00:21:29,923
对特定的恐怖组织
to specific terrorist units.

301
00:21:29,924 --> 00:21:30,924
然后他们做了什么
And then what did they do?

302
00:21:30,925 --> 00:21:31,626
好问题
Good question.

303
00:21:31,627 --> 00:21:33,361
你是不是刚按了办公室的某个按钮
Did you just push a button from an office somewhere

304
00:21:33,362 --> 00:21:35,863
砰的一声  到处都是爆炸声
and bam, explosion everywhere.

305
00:21:35,864 --> 00:21:38,499
没错  然后就少了几个恐怖分子
Exactly, and then there's a few less terrorists

306
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,401
把你表兄弟的腿给炸了  什么
to blow your cousins' legs off, what.

307
00:21:40,402 --> 00:21:41,803
我们是他们的恐怖分子
We're their terrorists.

308
00:21:42,971 --> 00:21:44,672
我们是他们眼中的入侵者
We're the invaders in their eyes.

309
00:21:44,673 --> 00:21:49,478
嘿  你表弟做的事很可敬
Hey, what your cousin was doing is honorable.

310
00:21:50,545 --> 00:21:52,346
他在尽自己的职责
He was doing his duty.

311
00:21:52,347 --> 00:21:54,682
就像我们要尽我们的职责一样
Just like we're gonna do our duty.

312
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,485
我们秘密行动
We operate in secret.

313
00:21:57,486 --> 00:21:58,953
但我们的资金是有保障的
But our funding is secure.

314
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:05,459
就像我常说的
And it's like I always say.

315
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,794
哦  不
Oh, no.

316
00:22:06,795 --> 00:22:09,197
如果一个人独自放屁然后
If a man farts alone and then...

317
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:11,031
不  不  不  你是说
No, no, no, you mean,

318
00:22:11,032 --> 00:22:12,800
一个自以为屁不臭的人
a man who thinks his farts don't stink...

319
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:15,436
不  不  如果一个人在森林里放屁
No, no, it's, if a man is in the forest and he farts...

320
00:22:15,437 --> 00:22:19,473
一个在秘密中放屁的人是一个失去了
A man who farts in confidence is a man who has lost...

321
00:22:19,474 --> 00:22:21,641
他的嗅觉
His sense of smell.

322
00:22:23,478 --> 00:22:25,046
-我喜欢这样  -就是这样
- I like that. - That's what it was.

323
00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:26,915
太恶心了
That's so gross.

324
00:22:48,036 --> 00:22:49,737
你为什么要在镜头前打断她的手臂
Why would you break her arm on camera

325
00:22:49,738 --> 00:22:52,039
当你不知道谁在看的时候
when you don't know who's watching?

326
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,808
除了给我惹麻烦
Except to make a shit storm for me?

327
00:22:55,477 --> 00:22:57,111
一次核攻击
One nuclear attack on our soil

328
00:22:57,112 --> 00:23:01,081
所有这些政治正确性都消失了
and all of this political correctness evaporates.

329
00:23:01,082 --> 00:23:02,616
这是一件愚蠢的事
It was a stupid thing to do

330
00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:04,485
这让事情变得非常困难
and it makes things very difficult.

331
00:23:04,486 --> 00:23:06,521
你的意思是你在中间很软
You mean you're gettin' soft in the middle.

332
00:23:09,591 --> 00:23:11,892
我所做的就是为你改变规则
All I do is bend the rules for you

333
00:23:11,893 --> 00:23:13,927
你总是在推动它
and you're always pushing it.

334
00:23:13,928 --> 00:23:16,864
是啊  多年来你的同事一直在开玩笑
Yeah, and for years your colleagues have been holding open

335
00:23:16,865 --> 00:23:20,067
一扇巨大的旋转门喊道  进来攻击我们
a huge revolving door shouting, come on in and attack us.

336
00:23:20,068 --> 00:23:21,302
嗯  这有点过于简单化了
Well, that's a bit of an oversimplification,

337
00:23:21,303 --> 00:23:23,171
但我理解你的沮丧
but I do understand your frustration.

338
00:23:23,172 --> 00:23:27,676
沮丧  现在你甚至在用华盛顿的话来安抚
Frustration, now you're even using D.C. appeasing words.

339
00:23:33,548 --> 00:23:35,283
我派你去做点什么
I'm sending you to do something.

340
00:23:35,284 --> 00:23:38,051
我不知道是什么  但它是开箱即用的
I'm not sure what it is, but it's out of the box.

341
00:23:44,193 --> 00:23:47,928
纳巴  那是什么名字
Nabahe, what the hell kind of a name is that?

342
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:48,797
我是纳瓦霍人
It's Navajo.

343
00:23:50,899 --> 00:23:53,201
我们一起参加了第一次海湾战争
We were in the first Gulf War together.

344
00:23:53,202 --> 00:23:54,068
看到了一些狗屎
Saw some shit.

345
00:23:55,637 --> 00:23:57,838
他经营一个叫影子狼的单位
He runs a unit called The Shadow Wolves.

346
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,573
是的  我听说过
Yeah, I've heard of 'em.

347
00:23:59,574 --> 00:24:02,075
印度的追踪者用传统的方式抓捕坏人
Indian trackers catchin' bad guys the old fashioned way.

348
00:24:02,076 --> 00:24:03,611
他们很擅长
And they're very good at it.

349
00:24:03,612 --> 00:24:06,414
我以为他们是缉毒局的  贩毒
I thought they were with the DEA, drug trafficking.

350
00:24:06,415 --> 00:24:07,848
预算削减没有让他们关门吗
Didn't budget cuts shut 'em down?

351
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:09,984
这是一个新的秘密单位  没人知道
This is a new covert unit, nobody knows.

352
00:24:11,486 --> 00:24:12,653
就连波塔克
Even Bor-Tac?

353
00:24:12,654 --> 00:24:14,121
他们在边防战术部门工作
They work with Border Control Tactical,

354
00:24:14,122 --> 00:24:16,524
但我资助他们和我朋友负责是有原因的
but there's a reason I fund them and my friend's in charge.

355
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:17,459
我是纳巴
It's Nabahe.

356
00:24:22,297 --> 00:24:24,498
所以  你在资助秘密印第安人
So, you're funding covert Indians.

357
00:24:24,499 --> 00:24:27,101
他们找到了带有核弹部件的叙利亚人
They found the Syrian with the nuclear bomb parts.

358
00:24:28,002 --> 00:24:28,803
在德国
In Germany.

359
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:34,309
纳巴在等你
Nabahe's expecting you.

360
00:24:37,145 --> 00:24:39,012
如果有什么发现你会否认的
And you'll disavow them if something's revealed

361
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:40,815
或者像你一样暴露
or uncovered just like you would me?

362
00:24:44,118 --> 00:24:45,287
你的飞机在等你
Your plane's waiting.

363
00:24:53,194 --> 00:24:55,396
很抱歉你的人在沙漠里被杀了
I'm sorry your man was killed in the desert

364
00:24:55,397 --> 00:24:56,965
靠那些该死的狼
by those damn wolves.

365
00:24:58,099 --> 00:25:00,334
我不喜欢这种新闻
I don't like this kind of news.

366
00:25:00,335 --> 00:25:03,771
穆罕默德就那样死了
Muhammad dying like that.

367
00:25:03,772 --> 00:25:06,841
我们还应该继续你的计划吗
Should we still move forward with your plan?

368
00:25:07,876 --> 00:25:10,911
我们必须马上去
We must go ahead, immediately.

369
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:14,815
没有耽搁  我没有时间
No delays, I don't have time.

370
00:25:35,804 --> 00:25:37,038
我知道这个差距
I know this gap.

371
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:47,181
我知道  它会回来的
I know it, it will come back to me.

372
00:25:49,751 --> 00:25:52,920
劳伦  请进
Lauren, please, come in.

373
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:05,999
他在这里干什么
What is he doing here?

374
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,868
他让我毛骨悚然
He gives me the creeps.

375
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:11,272
我也是  事实上  每个人
Me, too, in fact, everyone.

376
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,872
但这就是我让他在身边的原因
But that's why I keep him around.

377
00:26:18,012 --> 00:26:19,780
我一直很担心你
I've been worried about you.

378
00:26:19,781 --> 00:26:22,450
今晚和你搭讪的那个人是谁
Who is the man who accosted you tonight?

379
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:25,815
我以前见过的足球运动员
A footballer I used to see.

380
00:26:27,055 --> 00:26:30,157
你知道我在你之前和他们约会过  对吧
You know I dated a few of them before you, right?

381
00:26:30,158 --> 00:26:32,387
是的  是的  你做到了
Yes, yes, you did.

382
00:26:34,329 --> 00:26:37,060
但你向他们开枪了吗
But did you shoot guns at them?

383
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:41,898
当他们想虐待我的时候
When they tried to abuse me.

384
00:26:44,673 --> 00:26:48,004
他一定是为利物浦效力的
He must've played for Liverpool, then.

385
00:26:50,512 --> 00:26:53,409
我不知道你带着它
I didn't know you carry it.

386
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,446
哦  我刚开始

388
00:27:08,797 --> 00:27:09,826
当然
Sure.

389
00:27:29,217 --> 00:27:32,616
奥马尔不喜欢枪
Omar doesn't like guns.

390
00:27:35,356 --> 00:27:37,721
他更喜欢其他的防御方法

你不需要这个
You won't need this here.

394
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:02,679
尤其是和奥马尔在一起

395

抓住你的短裤
Hang on to your shorts.

399
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:13,542
欢迎来到我们的高科技T恤
Well, welcome to our high tech teepee.

400
00:30:15,383 --> 00:30:17,484
这一切都是你制造的
You built this all under the radar?

401
00:30:17,485 --> 00:30:18,652
是的  在你老板的帮助下

402
00:30:18,653 --> 00:30:20,253
但你不能告诉任何人
but you can't tell anybody.

403
00:30:20,254 --> 00:30:22,656
布兰森会在你来之前给我头皮

404
00:30:22,657 --> 00:30:25,726
嘿  各位  听着

408
00:30:30,832 --> 00:30:32,532
他有一部分是日本人

409
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:35,703
战后他祖父驻扎在东京

是的  我们称他为我们的本土武士

411
00:30:43,244 --> 00:30:44,912

我敢打赌他来自那个部落
I bet he's from that one tribe,

414
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:55,455
什么是著名的部落

00:30:55,456 --> 00:30:57,257
-哦  -想要的部落

That's the one.

418
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:02,562
你什么都没有
So, what, you got nothin'?

419
00:31:02,563 --> 00:31:03,897
我不知道有这样的事
I didn't realize there was such a thing

420
00:31:03,898 --> 00:31:05,232
作为一只母影狼
as a female Shadow Wolf.

421
00:31:05,233 --> 00:31:07,300
哦  他们是最凶残的一类  兄弟
Oh, they're the most ferocious kind, brother.

422
00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:08,802
她有爪子
And she's got claws.

423
00:31:08,803 --> 00:31:09,970
她的咬法呢
And her bite?

424
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:11,434
比她的吠声还糟
It's worse than her bark.

425
00:31:13,608 --> 00:31:15,142
所以呢
So?

426
00:31:15,143 --> 00:31:16,509
你打算怎么办
What are you gonna do?

427
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,807
你要加入我们吗
Are you gonna join us?

428
00:31:18,613 --> 00:31:19,642
还是你要跑
Or you gonna run?

429
00:31:22,851 --> 00:31:24,752
你知道  我不确定
You know, I'm not sure.

430
00:31:24,753 --> 00:31:27,387
但我会告诉你我会做什么  我会向你学习的
But I'll tell you what I will do, is I'll learn from you.

431
00:31:27,388 --> 00:31:30,157
因为我今天早上听到的一个故事
Because of a story I heard this morning.

432
00:31:30,158 --> 00:31:31,659
关于他
About him.

433
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,927
关于在某个被遗弃的村庄
About bein' in some godforsaken village

434
00:31:33,928 --> 00:31:36,529
在海湾战争期间的伊拉克
in Iraq during the Gulf War.

435
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,031
他一浪接一浪地拖延
He held off wave after wave

436
00:31:38,032 --> 00:31:41,064
萨达姆的共和国卫队拯救了他的部队和我的老板
of Saddam's Republican Guards saving his unit and my boss.

437
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:44,237
只是当地的民间传说
Just native folklore.

438
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:46,234
不是为了我老板
Not for my boss.

439
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,246
我妈妈身上有切诺基
My mother has some Cherokee in her.

440
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:54,409
这算不算
Does that count?

441
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:56,583
哦  伙计
Oh, man.

442
00:31:56,584 --> 00:31:58,185
每个人都有切诺基
Everybody got Cherokee in them.

443
00:31:58,186 --> 00:31:59,386
甚至约翰尼·德普
Even Johnny Depp.

444
00:31:59,387 --> 00:32:00,654
哦  现在有一个真正的印第安人
Ooh, now there's a real Indian.

445
00:32:00,655 --> 00:32:02,022
Pshh
Pshh.

446
00:32:02,023 --> 00:32:04,253
在我看来你不像强尼·德普
You don't look like no Johnny Depp to me.

447
00:33:00,048 --> 00:33:01,477
14天
14 days.

448
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,317
那是我剩下的大部分时间了
That's the most time I have left.

449
00:33:10,925 --> 00:33:15,024
我的实验室只能发现如何杀人
My lab can only discover how to kill,

450
00:33:16,264 --> 00:33:18,294
但不是如何治愈
but not how to heal.

451
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:26,402
帐号在里面
Account numbers are in there.

452
00:33:28,476 --> 00:33:30,643
处理好所有的债务
Take care of all debts.

453
00:33:30,644 --> 00:33:34,677
让华盛顿的人付出高昂的代价
And make the man in D.C. pay dearly.

454
00:33:40,421 --> 00:33:45,320
希望她从未出生
And make her wish she had never been born.

455
00:34:13,354 --> 00:34:14,754
你飞往墨西哥的班机是什么时候
When's your flight to Mexico?

456
00:34:14,755 --> 00:34:17,090
米尔顿十点钟来找我
Milton's got me on 10 o'clock.

457
00:34:17,091 --> 00:34:18,721
她打电话  你就跳
She calls, you jump.

458
00:34:21,029 --> 00:34:22,491
我们不都是吗
Don't we all?

459
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,670
我有两个最好的探员在追踪可汗
I have my two best agents tracking Khan.

460
00:34:30,671 --> 00:34:33,206
是的  米尔顿女士  我明白
Yes, Lady Milton, I understand.

461
00:34:33,207 --> 00:34:34,441
这需要一些时间
It will take some time.

462
00:34:34,442 --> 00:34:37,306
是的  我会联系的  谢谢
That's right, I will be in touch, thank you.

463
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,214
嗯  你把肖送到边境的预感是对的
Well, your hunch to send Shaw to the border was right.

464
00:34:41,215 --> 00:34:43,250
但他找到可汗的可能性有多大
But what are the odds of him actually finding Khan?

465
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:44,484
他们不好
They're not good.

466
00:34:44,485 --> 00:34:45,986
冰上巡逻队和边境巡逻队竭尽全力
ICE and Border Patrol do the best they can

467
00:34:45,987 --> 00:34:47,687
资源有限  但他们的手是绑着的
with limited resources, but their hands are tied.

468
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:49,622
可汗不会是唯一一个通过的人
And Khan won't be the only one getting across.

469
00:34:49,623 --> 00:34:51,224
去年有成千上万的叙利亚人越境
Thousands of Syrians crossed last year.

470
00:34:51,225 --> 00:34:52,893
谁知道其中有多少是伊斯兰国
Who knows how many of them are ISIS?

471
00:34:52,894 --> 00:34:54,027
但是  先生  审查程序
But, Sir, the vetting process.

472
00:34:54,028 --> 00:34:55,528
审查过程是假新闻
The vetting process is fake news.

473
00:34:55,529 --> 00:34:56,197
胡说
It's bullshit!

474
00:34:56,198 --> 00:34:58,994
谁知道有多少人可以转身或已经转身
Who knows how many could turn or have already turned?

475
00:35:01,569 --> 00:35:02,598
先生
Sir?

476
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:05,168
我很担心你
I'm worried about you.

477
00:35:06,941 --> 00:35:10,110
我知道你女儿被杀时发生了什么
I understand what happened when your daughter was killed

478
00:35:10,111 --> 00:35:12,846
在阿富汗  但我相信你在行动
in Afghanistan, but I believe that you are operating

479
00:35:12,847 --> 00:35:15,748
从报复的角度坦白地说
from a position of revenge and frankly,

480
00:35:15,749 --> 00:35:17,684
你违反了很多规定
you are breaking so many rules

481
00:35:17,685 --> 00:35:20,383
它不仅提醒我  它
that it not only alarms me, it...

482
00:35:21,389 --> 00:35:23,823
去完成这个想法吧
Go ahead and finish the thought.

483
00:35:23,824 --> 00:35:25,125
先生  请听我说
Sir, please listen to me.

484
00:35:25,126 --> 00:35:28,195
不  听我说  因为我只想说一次
No, listen to me, because I'm only gonna say this once.

485
00:35:28,196 --> 00:35:30,563
你不懂得珍惜
You have no appreciation for the significance

486
00:35:30,564 --> 00:35:32,065
我们现在的战斗
of the fight that we're in.

487
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:34,601
美国也犯了很多同样的错误
The U.S. is making the same mistakes so many others have.

488
00:35:34,602 --> 00:35:37,704
你这一代人不懂历史  所以你不知道
Your generation doesn't read history, so you have no clue

489
00:35:37,705 --> 00:35:40,307
我们正在重温威尔逊的绥靖错误
that we're reliving the appeasement mistakes of Wilson,

490
00:35:40,308 --> 00:35:43,543
在张伯伦的包围下跌跌撞撞地进入我们自己的维也纳
of Chamberlain, and stumbling into our own siege of Vienna.

491
00:35:43,544 --> 00:35:44,377
这是正确的
That's right.

492
00:35:44,378 --> 00:35:45,578
向我摇头
Shake your head at me

493
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:47,710
因为我不知道我在说什么
because I don't know what I'm talking about!

494
00:35:48,983 --> 00:35:51,418
你不会读ISIS社交媒体的每日新闻简报
You don't read the daily ISIS social media press briefings.

495
00:35:51,419 --> 00:35:52,953
在海滩上斩首数十人
Beheadings of dozens on a beach,

496
00:35:52,954 --> 00:35:54,922
把男人和女人活活烧死在笼子里
burning men and women alive in cages,

497
00:35:54,923 --> 00:35:56,785
我们应该什么都不做
and we're supposed to do nothing?

498
00:35:58,993 --> 00:36:01,962
还有一些她训练的胆小鬼士兵
And some chicken-shit soldier that she was training,

499
00:36:01,963 --> 00:36:03,830
她帮助过上更好的生活
who she was helping to lead a better life,

500
00:36:03,831 --> 00:36:05,732
他把枪对着她喷
he turns his gun on her and sprays her

501
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:09,864
面对子弹说：  上帝是伟大的
in the face with bullets and says, "God is great."

502
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:15,375
先生  对不起
Sir, I'm sorry...

503
00:36:15,376 --> 00:36:16,405
走出
Get out!

504
00:36:24,152 --> 00:36:25,585
所以你只能在街上闲逛
So you're just gonna roam the streets

505
00:36:25,586 --> 00:36:28,151
墨西哥敲毒品贩子的门
of Mexico knocking drug dealers' doors?

506
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:30,085
差不多吧
Something like that.

507
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,194
目标
Goal!

508
00:36:34,195 --> 00:36:37,130
一定是我最想念你的一件事
Has to be one of the things I missed about you most.

509
00:36:37,131 --> 00:36:38,161
别害怕
No fear.

510
00:36:40,701 --> 00:36:41,730
你错了
You're wrong.

511
00:36:44,105 --> 00:36:45,501
我有很多恐惧
I've got plenty of fear.

512
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,407
但我有一个密码
But I got one code.

513
00:36:47,408 --> 00:36:49,605
我知道  拥抱它
I know, embrace it.

514
00:36:53,347 --> 00:36:55,477
等等  我有东西给你
Wait, I have something for you.

515
00:37:21,909 --> 00:37:24,077
试试这个  史迪尔顿
Try this, Stilton.

516
00:37:24,078 --> 00:37:26,513
就在你妈妈的路上
Made just down the road from your mum.

517
00:37:26,514 --> 00:37:28,381
那么  可汗想要什么
So, what's got Khan wanting

518
00:37:28,382 --> 00:37:30,617
把脏弹偷偷带进美国
to sneak a dirty bomb into the U.S.?

519
00:37:30,618 --> 00:37:32,752
好吧  他资助恐怖袭击已经很多年了
Well, he's been financing terrorist attacks for years.

520
00:37:32,753 --> 00:37:33,387
你知道的
And you know this

521
00:37:33,388 --> 00:37:35,922
因为米尔顿让你跟着钱走
because Milton has you following the money?

522
00:37:35,923 --> 00:37:39,454
我从来不知道我的LSE学位会把我带到这样的高度
I never knew my LSE degree would take me to such heights.

523
00:37:40,494 --> 00:37:44,064
我以前离他比较近  但现在我只是个眼红
I used to be closer to him, but I'm just eye candy now.

524
00:37:44,065 --> 00:37:46,061
我们好几个月没睡过了
We haven't slept together for months.

525
00:37:48,836 --> 00:37:50,970
他有点不对劲
And there's something really wrong with him,

526
00:37:50,971 --> 00:37:52,372
某种疾病
some kind of sickness.

527
00:37:52,373 --> 00:37:53,606
他什么都不告诉我
He won't tell me a thing.

528
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:55,308
你认为这就是他现在的动力
And you think that's what's driving him now?

529
00:37:55,309 --> 00:37:57,510
在美国边境和伊斯兰国做点什么
Into doing something with ISIS on the U.S. border?

530
00:37:57,511 --> 00:37:58,507
也许 吧
Maybe.

531
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,810
最后一次为家人报仇的机会
A last chance to avenge his family.

532
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:03,750
他们来自阿富汗
They come from Afghanistan.

533
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:05,385
嗯  我应该说他们来了
Well, I should say they came.

534
00:38:05,386 --> 00:38:07,850
美军歼灭了其中大部分
U.S. military annihilated most of them.

535
00:38:08,856 --> 00:38:10,523
跟踪他到他家的村庄
Tracked him to his family's village,

536
00:38:10,524 --> 00:38:13,456
叫了无人机  所有人都被消灭了
called in drones, everyone wiped out.

537
00:38:14,662 --> 00:38:18,561
他的侄女  侄子  表亲  但他都不在
His nieces, nephews, cousins, but he wasn't even there.

538
00:38:21,302 --> 00:38:23,632
我们成了高科技野人
We've become high tech savages.

539
00:38:59,207 --> 00:39:00,668
奥马尔  你是什么
Omar, what are you...

540
00:39:12,386 --> 00:39:14,854
看  这里都是郊狼的踪迹
See, these are all the coyote trails here.

541
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:17,152
你接到布兰森的电话
You got a call, from Branson.

542
00:39:18,426 --> 00:39:21,490
嘿  夏安  让他起来  在你桌边
Hey, Cheyenne, et him up, at your desk.

543
00:39:22,996 --> 00:39:24,026
你好
Hello?

544
00:39:30,404 --> 00:39:33,936
所以  你叫夏延  但你是纳瓦霍人
So, your name's Cheyenne but you're Navajo.

545
00:39:34,642 --> 00:39:36,843
是的  那是雷诺
Yeah, and that's Reynaro.

546
00:39:36,844 --> 00:39:38,211
他甚至不是意大利人
He's not even Italian.

547
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:39,346
什么  你在跟我说话吗
What, are you talkin' to me?

548
00:39:39,347 --> 00:39:40,280
什么  你在跟我说话吗

549
00:39:40,281 --> 00:39:41,977
不  你在和我说话
No, you talkin' to me?

550
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:43,916
你在和我说话吗
Are you talkin' to me?

551
00:39:43,917 --> 00:39:46,314
别诋毁唯一伟大的涅罗
Stop defaming the only great Niro.

552
00:40:04,638 --> 00:40:06,105
哦  那是个帅哥
Oh, that's a good looking guy.

553
00:40:06,106 --> 00:40:07,503
那是你男朋友吗
Is that your boyfriend?

554
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:14,142
那是怪物杀手
That's the monster slayer.

555
00:40:15,115 --> 00:40:16,683
是纳瓦霍人的灵魂
It's a Navajo spirit?

556
00:40:16,684 --> 00:40:18,585
杀害异神的人
The slayer of strange gods.

557
00:40:18,586 --> 00:40:20,287
听起来像我的工作描述
Sounds like my job description.

558
00:40:20,288 --> 00:40:22,422
好吧  现在你完蛋了
Well, now you're screwed.

559
00:40:22,423 --> 00:40:24,324
我不能说我以前没听说过
I can't say I haven't heard that before.

560
00:40:24,325 --> 00:40:25,858
不是  我是认真的
No, I'm serious.

561
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:27,560
他会来找你的
He will come for you.

562
00:40:27,561 --> 00:40:29,525
当他这么做的时候  你就逃不掉了
And when he does, you won't escape.

563
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,395
那是你们民族的传说吗
Is that one of your peoples' legends?

564
00:40:37,104 --> 00:40:38,100
什么人
What people?

565
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,073
你在说谁
Who are you talkin' about?

566
00:40:41,074 --> 00:40:42,409
有珠子的那个
The ones with the beads?

567
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:43,976
地毯呢
And the rugs?

568
00:40:43,977 --> 00:40:44,973
那些人
Those people?

569
00:40:45,646 --> 00:40:46,913
你知道我的意思
You know what I meant.

570
00:40:46,914 --> 00:40:47,747
不  我不知道你是什么意思
No, I don't know what you meant.

571
00:40:47,748 --> 00:40:48,911
你为什么不告诉我
Why don't you tell me?

572
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,896
你到底把我弄进什么鬼地方了
What the hell have you gotten me into?

573
00:41:03,897 --> 00:41:05,398
这是怎么一回事
What is it?

574
00:41:05,399 --> 00:41:06,799
我问纳巴赫发生了什么事
I asked Nabahe what was goin' on.

575
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,702
他告诉我鸟的羽毛保护它
He told me that the feathers of a bird protect it

576
00:41:09,703 --> 00:41:11,700
冬天的霜冻
from the frosts of the winter.

577
00:41:12,706 --> 00:41:13,940
是的  那是他最喜欢的
Yeah, that's one of his favorites.

578
00:41:13,941 --> 00:41:15,475
是的  他好像有很多
Yeah, he seems to have a lot of 'em.

579
00:41:15,476 --> 00:41:16,676
我刚传给他的情报
The intel I just passed to him

580
00:41:16,677 --> 00:41:18,678
来自可靠的英国消息来源
is from a reliable British source.

581
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:21,481
Monte Rey外面的Menendez卡特尔正在帮助伊斯兰国营地
The Menendez Cartel outside Monte Rey are aiding ISIS camps

582
00:41:21,482 --> 00:41:22,749
靠近墨西哥边境
near the Mexican border.

583
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,016
Nabahe会让你掩护小径
Nabahe's gonna have you cover the trails

584
00:41:24,017 --> 00:41:25,952
他知道他们的狼用的
that he knows their coyotes use.

585
00:41:25,953 --> 00:41:27,220
是的  我今晚要和他出去
Yeah, well, I'm goin' out with him tonight.

586
00:41:27,221 --> 00:41:28,988
肖  只要给我找点看得见的东西
Shaw, just find me something tangible,

587
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:30,923
信号或可靠的人类情报
signal or reliable human intel.

588
00:41:30,924 --> 00:41:32,525
我一分钱也拿不到
I can't get a dime out of anyone here,

589
00:41:32,526 --> 00:41:33,993
尤其是对于一些隐蔽的东西
especially for something covert,

590
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:35,528
除非我有具体的东西
unless I have something concrete.

591
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:37,697
是啊  也许一个孤独的战士可以造成更多的伤害
Yeah, well maybe a lone warrior can do more damage

592
00:41:37,698 --> 00:41:40,333
比整个军队在陌生的地方
than an entire army in unfamiliar territory.

593
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:41,301
我没听说过那个
I haven't heard that one.

594
00:41:41,302 --> 00:41:43,270
从一个饼干盒里
From a Cracker Jack box.

595
00:41:43,271 --> 00:41:46,172
我10岁  它对我说
I was 10, it spoke to me.

596
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:47,169
走吧
Just go.

597
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:01,416
所以  我老板出城了
So, my boss is out of town.

598
00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:04,653
我在经营这个地方
I'm running this place.

599
00:42:07,561 --> 00:42:08,591
这种方式
This way.

600
00:42:10,598 --> 00:42:13,662
噢  要是我有枪就好了  你这个小混蛋
Oh, if only I had my rifle, you little rat bastard.

601
00:42:22,075 --> 00:42:23,539
这是一大笔钱
This is a lot of money.

602
00:42:24,412 --> 00:42:25,841
是的  是的
Yes, it is.

603
00:42:27,348 --> 00:42:28,877
但你很狡猾
But you are a tricky one.

604
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:34,621
所以  是什么阻止了我杀了你
So, what's stopping me from killing you

605
00:42:34,622 --> 00:42:36,418
把这些都留着  嗯
and keeping all this, eh?

606
00:42:46,334 --> 00:42:47,796
我刚刚杀了她
I just had her killed.

607
00:42:49,136 --> 00:42:50,733
因为背叛了我
For betraying me.

608
00:42:53,307 --> 00:42:56,539
我认为你把我当成敌人是愚蠢的
I think you would be foolish to make me your enemy.

609
00:42:57,811 --> 00:42:59,241
你看起来不像个傻瓜
You don't look like a fool.

610
00:43:01,715 --> 00:43:02,745
不
No.

611
00:43:06,387 --> 00:43:08,884
我还需要你小心这个英国人
I also need you to watch out for this Brit,

612
00:43:09,523 --> 00:43:11,720
你怎么说的  暴徒
how you say it, thug.

613
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,361
你想什么时候离开
When do you want to leave?

614
00:43:14,362 --> 00:43:15,758
明晚
Tomorrow night.

615
00:43:17,565 --> 00:43:19,832
你的人在那里见你
And your men are meeting you there?

616
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:21,329
我什么时候告诉他们
I'll let them know when.

617
00:43:23,504 --> 00:43:26,439
我不想要像上次那样的惊喜
I don't want any surprises like last time.

618
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,775
那不会发生的
That won't happen.

619
00:43:28,776 --> 00:43:31,811
但是那些狼  我不能保证
But those wolves, I can't guarantee.

620
00:43:31,812 --> 00:43:33,275
别担心他们
Don't worry about them.

621
00:43:35,716 --> 00:43:37,279
我有他们的计划
I have plans for them.

622
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:48,428
哦  别惹她
Oh, don't mess with her.

623
00:43:48,429 --> 00:43:52,027
她是个卑鄙的人  嗯
She's a mean one, eh?

624
00:43:52,866 --> 00:43:55,297
刺客
Assassin.

625
00:44:09,517 --> 00:44:10,450
你知道吗
You know what?

626
00:44:10,451 --> 00:44:11,566
你需要让你的灵魂安静下来
You need to quiet your soul.

627
00:44:14,555 --> 00:44:17,790
你真的变成了一个和大自然在一起的人  嗯
You really become one with nature out here, huh?

628
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:22,361
哦  你在这里看到很多奇怪的东西
Oh, you see a lotta weird things out here.

629
00:44:22,362 --> 00:44:23,930
让你们城里人跑回去
Make you city people run back

630
00:44:23,931 --> 00:44:26,729
去你的公寓和购物中心
to your condos and your shoppin' malls.

631
00:44:27,968 --> 00:44:30,599
你在这里见过最奇怪的事是什么
What's the strangest thing you've ever seen out here?

632
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:32,467
什么  在你身边
What, beside you?

633
00:44:35,676 --> 00:44:40,876
大约一周前我们
About a week ago we were

634
00:44:41,649 --> 00:44:43,883
看着一条路  就在那山脊上
lookin' at a path up there, just over that ridge,

635
00:44:43,884 --> 00:44:49,017
看到了这个小小的红灯  这个小小的红点
and saw this little red light, this little red dot.

636
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:51,091
激光
Laser.

637
00:44:51,092 --> 00:44:54,894
不  只是一个红点  然后它就开了
No, it was just a red dot, and then it went zip!

638
00:44:54,895 --> 00:44:58,593
在这里大约200码然后这个
Over here about 200 yards and then this

639
00:44:59,567 --> 00:45:05,167
闻  这臭味  腐烂  然后这个
smell, this stench, rotten, and then this

640
00:45:07,274 --> 00:45:10,338
笑  这奇怪的笑声
laugh, this weird cackle,

641
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:14,910
我不知道是什么  然后不知从哪里冒出来
I don't know what it was, and then out of nowhere.

642
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,390
我对你很好  不是吗
I got ya pretty good, didn't I?

643
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:26,321
很有趣
Very funny.

644
00:45:27,194 --> 00:45:28,423
那味道呢
What about the smell?

645
00:45:29,697 --> 00:45:32,599
嗯  那部分是真的
Well, that part's true.

646
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,535
有时我们能抓住别人只是因为你能闻到他们
Sometimes we can catch people just 'cause you can smell 'em,

647
00:45:35,536 --> 00:45:37,504
有时半英里外
sometimes half a mile away.

648
00:45:37,505 --> 00:45:38,671
你现在闻到什么了吗
Do you smell something now?

649
00:45:38,672 --> 00:45:40,406
是啊  你吃了太多玉米煎饼了
Yeah, you been eatin' too many burritos.

650
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:42,705
别碰豆子  好吗
Stay away from the beans, will ya?

651
00:45:49,316 --> 00:45:51,113
最难闻的气味是恐惧
The worst smell is fear.

652
00:45:55,656 --> 00:45:57,085
你也能闻到内疚的味道
You can smell guilt, too.

653
00:45:57,791 --> 00:45:59,087
从你的毛孔里出来
Comes outta your pores.

654
00:46:11,271 --> 00:46:13,001
在那边的小路上
Up the path over there.

655
00:46:15,342 --> 00:46:16,576
郊狼带头
Coyotes leadin'.

656
00:46:16,577 --> 00:46:18,073
看起来像四个人
It looks like four people.

657
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,277
去找马和夏延
Go find Horse and Cheyenne.

658
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:39,832
趴下  趴下  趴下  趴下
Get down, get down, get down, get down!

659
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:42,163
别动  别动
Don't move, don't move!

660
00:46:43,637 --> 00:46:46,200
-别动  -趴下
- Don't move! - Get down!

661
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,675
趴下  趴下
Get down, get down.

662
00:46:48,676 --> 00:46:51,439
-趴下  -在地上  现在
- Get down. - On the ground, now!

663
00:46:53,246 --> 00:46:54,809
这些都不是可汗
None of these are Khan.

664
00:46:56,584 --> 00:46:57,884
不
No!

665
00:46:57,885 --> 00:46:59,185
趴下  趴下
Get down, get down.

666
00:46:59,186 --> 00:47:00,887
-嘿  嘿  -趴下  趴下
- Hey, hey! - Stay down, stay down!

667
00:47:00,888 --> 00:47:03,055
嘿  回来  下来
Hey, get back here, get down!

668
00:47:03,056 --> 00:47:04,991
趴下  趴下
Stay down, stay down!

669
00:47:04,992 --> 00:47:06,727
-在地上  在地上  嘿  -在地上
- On the ground! On the ground, hey! - On the ground.

670
00:47:06,728 --> 00:47:07,928
夏延  掩护他们
Cheyenne, keep 'em covered.

671
00:47:07,929 --> 00:47:09,591
回来  嘿
Get back here, hey!

672
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,340
他到底去哪了  马
Where the hell did he go, Horse?

673
00:47:21,341 --> 00:47:23,409
我们永远找不到他
We're never gonna find him.

674
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:26,607
郊狼就这样消失了
Out here coyotes can disappear just like that.

675
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:38,220
到那边去
Get over there.

676
00:47:47,567 --> 00:47:49,802
那女孩会怎么样
What'll happen to the girl?

677
00:47:49,803 --> 00:47:51,303
可能会把她卖给性交易
Probably gonna sell her to the sex trade.

678
00:47:51,304 --> 00:47:54,073
狼会以这种或那种方式赚钱的
The coyote's gonna make his money one way or another.

679
00:47:54,074 --> 00:47:59,207
不
No!

680
00:48:30,978 --> 00:48:34,042
怪物杀手  纳瓦霍精灵
Monster slayer, Navajo spirit.

681
00:48:35,448 --> 00:48:37,245
他是异神的杀手
He's the slayer of strange gods.

682
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:39,952
他会来找你的
He will come for you.

683
00:48:39,953 --> 00:48:42,484
当他这么做的时候  你就逃不掉了
And when he does, you won't escape.

684
00:49:37,577 --> 00:49:39,011
肖
Shaw!

685
00:49:39,012 --> 00:49:41,015
埃里克
Eric!

686
00:49:43,016 --> 00:49:44,779
你看到凶手了吗
You saw the slayer?

687
00:49:57,564 --> 00:50:00,762
在夏安打电话给你之前你不会回来找我们的
You wouldn't come back to us until Cheyenne called to you.

688
00:50:02,669 --> 00:50:04,799
来吧  我有个地方让你睡
Come on, I got a place for you to bunk.

689
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:20,853
好
Well?

690
00:50:20,854 --> 00:50:22,121
不
No!

691
00:50:22,122 --> 00:50:24,256
为什么我们不能打电话到国土局
Why can't we just call in Homeland?

692
00:50:24,257 --> 00:50:27,126
-有无人驾驶飞机在沙漠边界搜索吗  -因为他们什么都不会做
- Have drones search the desert border? - Because they won't do anything.

693
00:50:27,127 --> 00:50:28,995
他们会监听无辜者的电话
They'll listen in on innocent peoples' phone calls,

694
00:50:28,996 --> 00:50:30,696
他们会看每封该死的邮件
they'll read every goddamn email,

695
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:32,231
但要他们监视边境
but ask them for surveillance on the border,

696
00:50:32,232 --> 00:50:33,565
而且  哦  不  我们不能那样做
and it's, oh, no, we can't do that.

697
00:50:33,566 --> 00:50:35,101
但我和祖国有联系
But I have a connection at Homeland

698
00:50:35,102 --> 00:50:36,068
他欠我一个人情
and he owes me a favor.

699
00:50:36,069 --> 00:50:36,869
你要告诉他们什么
What are you gonna tell them?

700
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:38,505
哦  我知道会有坏事发生吗
Oh, I know something bad is gonna happen?

701
00:50:38,506 --> 00:50:40,807
亚历克斯  他们告诉他们的时候没有听沙特的
Alex, they didn't listen to the Saudis when they told them

702
00:50:40,808 --> 00:50:43,109
关于车臣轰炸机炸毁波士顿马拉松
about the Chechen bomber blowing up the Boston Marathon,

703
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:44,176
但他们会听你的
but they'll listen to you.

704
00:50:44,177 --> 00:50:46,378
请原谅我
Excuse me.

705
00:50:46,379 --> 00:50:47,375
关上门
Close the door.

706
00:50:50,683 --> 00:50:52,051
刚好赶上
Just in time.

707
00:50:52,052 --> 00:50:53,019
为了什么
For?

708
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,286
我在这里一事无成
I'm getting nowhere here.

709
00:50:54,287 --> 00:50:55,955
你的经纪人是我们最好的机会
Your agent is the best chance we have.

710
00:50:55,956 --> 00:50:57,319
我需要你推他
I need you to push him.

711
00:50:58,458 --> 00:51:00,126
到底要做什么
To do what, exactly?

712
00:51:00,127 --> 00:51:01,523
我们需要找到可汗
We need to find Khan.

713
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:05,359
我看看我能做什么
I'll see what I can do.

714
00:51:11,404 --> 00:51:13,105
迈凯轮的最新消息是什么
What's the latest on McLaren?

715
00:51:13,106 --> 00:51:14,969
他核实了可汗在墨西哥的情况
He verified Khan's in Mexico.

716
00:51:15,976 --> 00:51:17,572
你现在应该去那里
You should head there now.

717
00:51:18,545 --> 00:51:19,979
在他再次起诉之前
Before he just charges in again?

718
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,348
不幸的是  这就是他
Unfortunately, it's what makes him

719
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:25,413
如此有效和破坏性
so effective and destructive.

720
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,355
就像我认识的所有男人一样
Like all the men I know.

721
00:51:31,956 --> 00:51:32,524
第一个女人
The first woman

722
00:51:32,525 --> 00:51:35,895
领导这个地方被称为家庭主妇间谍
to lead this place was called the housewife spy.

723
00:51:35,896 --> 00:51:37,192
她经历了地狱
She went through hell.

724
00:51:38,531 --> 00:51:41,133
试图控制但丁的9度
Trying to contain Dante's nine degrees?

725
00:51:42,134 --> 00:51:43,435
是的
Yup.

726
00:51:43,436 --> 00:51:45,137
我把他留在那里是为了提醒自己
I keep him there to remind myself

727
00:51:45,138 --> 00:51:47,202
我们面对的是同一个地狱
that we're dealing with the same hell,

728
00:51:48,141 --> 00:51:49,704
只是不同的魔鬼
just different devils.

729
00:52:04,892 --> 00:52:05,824
白宫
White House.

730
00:52:05,825 --> 00:52:07,555
我要和莱恩·布莱克谈谈
I need to speak to Ryan Blake.

731
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:11,864
亚历克斯  怎么了
Alex, what's up?

732
00:52:11,865 --> 00:52:14,696
布兰森和米-6有点关系
Branson is up to something with MI-6.

733
00:52:15,869 --> 00:52:17,999
快过来
Come over now.

734
00:52:33,686 --> 00:52:35,049
你是真的吗
Are you real?

735
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:38,986
你是吗
Are you?

736
00:52:40,393 --> 00:52:42,457
这是个好问题
That's a good question.

737
00:52:45,065 --> 00:52:47,028
楚其  别管他
Chucky, leave him alone!

738
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:51,466
你睡在我房间里
You slept in my room.

739
00:52:53,273 --> 00:52:54,269
是 啊
Yeah.

740
00:52:56,009 --> 00:52:57,472
想看魔术吗
Wanna see a magic trick?

741
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:00,541
可以
Okay.

742
00:53:03,683 --> 00:53:04,750
肖  听到了吗
Shaw, you hear me?

743
00:53:04,751 --> 00:53:06,018
是的
I did.

744
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:07,048
前进
Go ahead.

745
00:53:21,801 --> 00:53:22,830
为了我
For me?

746
00:53:24,871 --> 00:53:26,172
现在吃你的薄煎饼
Now eat your damn pancakes.

747
00:53:26,173 --> 00:53:27,606
我们得走了
We gotta go.

748
00:53:27,607 --> 00:53:28,903
谢谢您
Thank you.

749
00:53:42,189 --> 00:53:44,386
拜托  你不能逃跑
Come on, you're not escaping.

750
00:53:45,225 --> 00:53:47,189
嗨  嗨  伙计们

你一定很骄傲

753

这是他们的祖父
And this is their grandfather.

754
00:54:03,476 --> 00:54:04,506
那是谁
Who's that?

00:54:05,645 --> 00:54:08,947
哦  那是娜塔妮  娜芭的哥哥
Oh, that's Natanni, Nabahe's brother.

757
00:54:10,317 --> 00:54:12,151
海豹突击队六队
SEAL Team Six?

758
00:54:12,152 --> 00:54:14,316
他们很多年没说话了
They haven't spoken in many years.

759
00:54:15,455 --> 00:54:18,190
是的  发生了一些非常糟糕的事情
Yeah, something, something really bad happened

760
00:54:18,191 --> 00:54:20,688
在他们之间  他们只是没有

761
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:27,866
娜塔妮
Na-tan-ee?

762
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:32,004
你们白人就是这么说的
That's the way you white people would say it.

763
00:54:32,005 --> 00:54:35,702
不是阿尼  是指领袖
Not-ah-nee, it means leader.

764
00:54:53,693 --> 00:54:55,623
来吧  孩子们  帮我一把
Come on, boys, give me a hand here.

765
00:55:17,884 --> 00:55:20,214
你走的是我们祖先的路

766

你为拯救我们的土地而战斗

767

我为你骄傲  儿子

敬礼
Salute!

770
00:56:14,441 --> 00:56:17,204
什么  你以为我不知道你要来
What, you didn't think I knew you were coming?

771
00:56:28,855 --> 00:56:30,956
你有一些严重的问题
You've got some serious issues.

772
00:56:30,957 --> 00:56:31,890
是的  告诉我
Yeah, tell me about it.

773
00:56:31,891 --> 00:56:33,392
你知道他刚跟我们说了什么吗
You know what he just told us?

774
00:56:33,393 --> 00:56:35,861
可汗在美国已经有两个情报局的小组了
That Khan has two ISIS cells already here, in the U.S.,

775
00:56:35,862 --> 00:56:37,363
他们已经等了好几个月了
and they've been waiting for 'em for months.

776
00:56:37,364 --> 00:56:39,398
我告诉过你我不会站着
And I told you I will not stand

777
00:56:39,399 --> 00:56:40,932
为了这些审讯
for these kinds of interrogations.

778
00:56:40,933 --> 00:56:43,068
亚历克斯  没时间了
Alex, there isn't time.

779
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:45,003
我们没有钱让他成为我们的朋友
We don't have the luxury to make him our friend

780
00:56:45,004 --> 00:56:46,705
帮助他认清自己的错误
and help him see the error of his ways.

781
00:56:46,706 --> 00:56:48,407
如果他只是对你撒谎呢
And what if he just lied to you?

782
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:49,641
只是让你停下来
Just to get you to stop?

783
00:56:49,642 --> 00:56:51,177
你想冒这个险吗
And you wanna take that chance?

784
00:56:51,178 --> 00:56:53,044
如果他说的是实话我们就错失了机会
That if he's telling the truth we miss the opportunity

785
00:56:53,045 --> 00:56:54,713
阻止袭击
to stop an attack?

786
00:56:54,714 --> 00:56:56,482
没人会在乎我们是怎么得到这些信息的
Nobody's gonna care how we got the information

787
00:56:56,483 --> 00:56:57,916
如果我们能阻止这一切
if we can stop this.

788
00:56:57,917 --> 00:56:59,050
这不是一场公平的战斗
It's not a fair fight.

789
00:56:59,051 --> 00:56:59,885
你不明白
You don't get it.

790
00:56:59,886 --> 00:57:01,082
就这么简单
It's that simple.

791
00:57:13,533 --> 00:57:15,667
仪式到了吗
Ceremony get to you?

792
00:57:15,668 --> 00:57:17,098
我什么都有
Everything's got to me.

793
00:57:20,973 --> 00:57:22,303
你看到讽刺了吗
You do see the irony?

794
00:57:24,244 --> 00:57:25,306
什么
What?

795
00:57:26,279 --> 00:57:29,276
你的人  有珠子的人
Your people, the ones with the beads?

796
00:57:32,285 --> 00:57:34,085
还有那些有着悠久历史的
But also the ones that have a long-standing history

797
00:57:34,086 --> 00:57:36,083
为这个国家的军队服务
of serving this country's military.

798
00:57:37,089 --> 00:57:38,857
正是军队把他们赶出了自己的土地
The very army that ran them off their lands,

799
00:57:38,858 --> 00:57:40,091
屠宰和散播
slaughtering and scattering them

800
00:57:40,092 --> 00:57:42,524
从一个地方到另一个地方
from one hellhole of a reservation to the next.

801
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:52,571
纳巴有句话
Nabahe has a saying.

802
00:57:52,572 --> 00:57:54,139
你的意思是    一切都有联系吗
You mean, "All is connected?"

803
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:56,342
是的  那个
Yeah, that one.

804
00:57:56,343 --> 00:57:57,705
但他还有一个
But he has another one.

805
00:57:59,145 --> 00:58:02,977
每一代人都为下一代做出牺牲
"Each generation sacrifices for the next."

806
00:58:04,083 --> 00:58:06,948
联系就是牺牲
The connection is the sacrifice.

807
00:58:35,882 --> 00:58:37,616
他在对面
He's across.

808
00:58:37,617 --> 00:58:40,286
我把他留在华雷斯那家被烧毁的工厂
I left him in that burnt factory in Juarez

809
00:58:40,287 --> 00:58:41,583
和他那种人在一起
with some of his kind.

810
00:58:42,589 --> 00:58:47,621
还有一件事  对任何人都一言不发  嗯
And another thing, not a word to anyone, eh?

811
00:58:50,029 --> 00:58:51,425
老板永远不会知道
The boss can never know.

812
00:59:16,356 --> 00:59:19,987
我能从这里闻到你的臭屁股  朋友
I can smell your stinky ass from here, amigo.

813
00:59:31,804 --> 00:59:33,505
垃圾车在拖车上
Dirt bike's on the trailer.

814
00:59:33,506 --> 00:59:35,040
你知道他在哪吗
You know where he is?

815
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:36,107
嗯  我有一件事是肯定的
Well, I know one thing for sure.

816
00:59:36,108 --> 00:59:37,543
朱尼尔  拿了我的麦克风吗
Junior, got my mic?

817
00:59:37,544 --> 00:59:39,611
你的老板总是善于获取情报
Your boss is always good at getting intel.

818
00:59:39,612 --> 00:59:40,846
麦克风系统准备好了
Mic system's up and ready.

819
00:59:40,847 --> 00:59:42,948
不远处是一家废弃的工厂

820
00:59:42,949 --> 00:59:44,750
小家伙  马甲

821
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:46,151
叫Bor Tac来  边境巡逻队

822
00:59:46,152 --> 00:59:47,553
雷  拿点45和箱子
Ray, take the .45 and the case.

823
00:59:47,554 --> 00:59:48,554

824
00:59:48,555 --> 00:59:49,721
枪上了子弹
Guns are loaded.

825
00:59:49,722 --> 00:59:51,222
听着  我不会冒着被人骂的风险
Listen, I'm not gonna risk getting crap

826
00:59:51,223 --> 00:59:53,024
为了一些英国人的预感
for some Brit's hunch.

827
00:59:53,025 --> 00:59:54,059
我给肖买了件背心
I got a vest for Shaw.

828
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,923
快点  我们走
Come on, let's go!

829
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:41,573
你刚刚受洗
You have just been baptized

830
01:00:41,574 --> 01:00:44,038
带着桑切斯的尿  我的朋友
with Sanchez's piss, my friend.

831
01:00:46,345 --> 01:00:47,341
没什么
That's nothing.

832
01:00:48,347 --> 01:00:49,781
在伊拉克沙漠里喝了我自己的尿
Drank my own piss in the Iraqi desert

833
01:00:49,782 --> 01:00:52,083
为了活两个星期

834
01:00:52,084 --> 01:00:54,215
真恶心
That is disgusting.

01:00:55,488 --> 01:01:02,988
但你是个年轻的强壮的男孩  哈
But you are a young strapping, tough boy, huh?

836
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:07,128
不  只有英国人

837
01:01:09,168 --> 01:01:12,634
哦  谢谢你帮我穿好衣服

事实上  我要谢谢你

因为我在主持一个募捐活动

841
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:20,674
为了死去的英国间谍的家人

842
01:01:23,249 --> 01:01:26,413
你想来我的国家干什么

Listen, I don't care about you sellin' drugs

844
01:01:33,826 --> 01:01:36,227
对于愚蠢的美国孩子

845
01:01:36,228 --> 01:01:39,064
但你知道你在和伊斯兰国的混蛋做交易

846
01:01:39,065 --> 01:01:41,533
他们要炸掉那些顾客

越境走私恐怖分子

848
01:01:44,671 --> 01:01:47,238
只是为了摧毁你们的市场

我是说  你有多蠢

他到底在说什么
What the hell is he talkin' about?

851
01:01:56,182 --> 01:01:57,282
他神志不清
He's delirious.

852
01:01:57,283 --> 01:01:58,245
桑切斯

我觉得议会很狡猾
And I thought Parliament was devious.

855
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:13,264
如果我是你  我会照顾你的  朋友

856
01:02:13,265 --> 01:02:14,500

死去的顾客不给我付账单

859

既然你很喜欢

860

我们会为你的午餐提供更多的小便

你的英语怎么说
How do you English say?

865

你是个厚脸皮的家伙
You are a cheeky fellow.

866

我敢打赌你的头会成为一个好足球

带他去仓库
Take him to the warehouse!

870
01:03:08,487 --> 01:03:09,621
有什么事吗
Anything?

871
01:03:09,622 --> 01:03:11,723
什么都没有
There's nothing.

872
01:03:11,724 --> 01:03:15,861

880
01:03:37,249 --> 01:03:39,685
嗯  有时候你得等
Well, sometimes you just gotta wait.

881
01:03:39,686 --> 01:03:41,186
当你猎杀响尾蛇的时候
Figure when you're huntin' rattlesnakes...

882
01:03:41,187 --> 01:03:42,784
小心  他们先咬你

哦  你到底在这里干什么

离他们来还有一分钟

抓住迈凯轮  我们离开这里
Get McLaren, let's get outta here!

不能失去你  少校

987
01:17:03,021 --> 01:17:04,489
我不知道你到底在说什么
I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.

988
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:10,923
告诉你的狼群  还有你那凶残的国安局同伙
Tell your wolves, and your murderous NSA sidekick,

989
01:17:10,962 --> 01:17:13,731
如果他们打一个电话

990
01:17:13,732 --> 01:17:15,629
我要炸掉你妻子的头

991
01:17:17,168 --> 01:17:18,599
在楚其面前
In front of Chucky.

992
01:17:24,643 --> 01:17:25,643
我是认真的
I mean it!

993
01:17:25,644 --> 01:17:27,608
我在用相机监视你
I'm watching you with my cameras.

994
01:17:30,015 --> 01:17:31,044
嘘
Psst.

995
01:17:44,463 --> 01:17:45,696
你做了什么
What have you done?

996
01:17:45,697 --> 01:17:47,932
死亡来得那么快
Death comes that quick.

997
01:17:47,933 --> 01:17:52,302
从天上发射的东西  一代又一代被消灭
Something fired from the heavens, generations wiped out,

998
01:17:52,303 --> 01:17:54,539
屠杀无辜的孩子
slaughtered innocent children,

999
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:57,842
把爷爷的头给炸了
blow the heads off of grandfathers.

1000
01:17:57,843 --> 01:17:59,109
如果你杀了他们
If you kill them...

1001
01:17:59,110 --> 01:18:01,273
你就跑了
And you ran away!

1002
01:18:02,814 --> 01:18:05,712
你和你的小狼
You and your little wolves.

1003
01:18:07,553 --> 01:18:12,753
那么勇敢  跑回你的圣地
So brave, running back here to your sacred lands.

1004
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:16,890
你以为你很安全
You thought you were safe.

1005
01:18:18,964 --> 01:18:19,960
不
No.

1006
01:18:22,034 --> 01:18:26,832
勇敢的战士  你的痛苦不会这么快结束
Brave warrior, your pain will not be over so quick.

1007
01:18:30,308 --> 01:18:32,706
纳巴  请照他说的做
Nabahe, do what he said, please.

1008
01:18:39,585 --> 01:18:40,818
你可以拥有我
You can have me.

1009
01:18:40,819 --> 01:18:42,086
让他们走吧
Just let them go.

1010
01:18:42,087 --> 01:18:44,685
我从来没有提出过这样的建议
I never got to make such an offer.

1011
01:18:45,924 --> 01:18:49,422
清晨  一个村庄沉睡
Early morning, a village sleeps,

1012
01:18:50,796 --> 01:18:54,394
不打扰大美洲帝国
not bothering the great American empire.

1013
01:18:55,534 --> 01:18:57,731
然后按下一个按钮
Then a button is pushed.

1014
01:18:59,671 --> 01:19:04,041
岩石压碎了我母亲的头
Rocks crush the head of my mother,

1015
01:19:04,042 --> 01:19:06,944
我每晚亲吻的脸颊
the very cheeks I kissed each night.

1016
01:19:06,945 --> 01:19:11,311
你不认为我会乞求你现在做什么
You do not think I would have begged for what you do now?

1017
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:13,518
为了他们我
Me for them?

1018
01:19:13,519 --> 01:19:15,515
我支持他们
Me for them!

1019
01:19:20,091 --> 01:19:21,391
不
No!

1020
01:19:21,392 --> 01:19:22,993
纳巴  嘿  嘿
Nabahe, hey, hey!

1021
01:19:22,994 --> 01:19:25,696
纳巴  你得保持清醒
Nabahe, you gotta keep your head.

1022
01:19:25,697 --> 01:19:26,631
他还没杀他们
He hasn't killed 'em yet.

1023
01:19:26,632 --> 01:19:27,464
他只是在争取时间
He's just buyin' time.

1024
01:19:27,465 --> 01:19:28,465
我们得给祖国打电话
We gotta call Homeland.

1025
01:19:28,466 --> 01:19:29,667
不  他会杀了他们
No, he will kill them!

1026
01:19:29,668 --> 01:19:31,931
他会杀更多的人
Well, he's gonna kill a whole lot more.

1027
01:19:45,183 --> 01:19:46,416
这是我们部落的赌场
It's our tribe's casino.

1028
01:19:46,417 --> 01:19:49,386
是的  我们现在得找到这个拖车
Yeah, and we gotta find this trailer now.

1029
01:19:49,387 --> 01:19:51,088
谁知道他有什么计划
Who knows what he's got planned!

1030
01:19:51,089 --> 01:19:52,723
你不会杀了我妻子和女儿的
You're not gonna get my wife and daughter killed.

1031
01:19:52,724 --> 01:19:54,087
纳巴  不
Nabahe, no.

1032
01:20:02,267 --> 01:20:03,296
什么
What?

1033
01:20:06,471 --> 01:20:08,305
你想让我做什么
What do you want me to do?

1034
01:20:08,306 --> 01:20:10,307
在你的圣山见我
Meet me at your sacred hill.

1035
01:20:10,308 --> 01:20:12,505
你的祖先可以看着你死在那里
Your ancestors can watch you die there.

1036
01:20:15,213 --> 01:20:16,342
我会去的
I'll be there.

1037
01:20:17,616 --> 01:20:19,846
小家伙  把马送到医院
Junior, get Horse to a hospital.

1038
01:20:46,845 --> 01:20:48,478
他说员工停车场有拖车
He says there's a trailer in employee parking.

1039
01:20:48,479 --> 01:20:50,210
我们把所有人都救出来
Let's get everyone out.

1040
01:21:11,502 --> 01:21:14,304
肖  他们正在疏散赌场
Shaw, they're evacuating the casino now.

1041
01:21:14,305 --> 01:21:15,335
很好
Good.

1042
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:23,309

1043
01:21:38,096 --> 01:21:42,829
来吧  你妻子在这边
Come, your wife is this way.

1044

不  等等  等等  等等  等等  等等  等等  等等
No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1045
01:21:51,977 --> 01:21:52,973
它被操纵了
It's rigged.

1046
01:21:56,481 --> 01:21:57,581
可以
Okay.

1047
01:21:57,582 --> 01:21:58,983
有人在里面
Someone's in there.

嘿  你能听见我说话吗
Hey, can you hear me?

1050
01:22:03,621 --> 01:22:04,650
有个通风口
There's a vent.

1051
01:22:06,758 --> 01:22:08,893
嘿  你能听见我说话吗

1052
01:22:08,894 --> 01:22:10,227
我什么也看不见
I can't see anything.

1053
01:22:10,228 --> 01:22:11,391
在这里

楚其  你没事吧

1056
01:22:20,338 --> 01:22:22,701
楚其  你受伤了吗
Chucky, are you hurt?

1057

是个炸弹
It's a bomb.

01:22:43,394 --> 01:22:45,229
好吧  等等  楚其

1062
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:47,827
等一下
Hold on a second now.

1063
01:22:54,405 --> 01:22:57,541
开枪打我  你的赌场就爆炸了
Shoot me, and your casino blows up.

1064
01:22:57,542 --> 01:23:01,707
每个人都会为他们腐朽的狂欢而死
Everybody will be dead at their decadent rave.

1065
01:23:03,014 --> 01:23:05,878
不  勇敢的战士
No, brave warrior.

1066
01:23:06,852 --> 01:23:09,849
现在没有白人武器能救你了
No white man weapons can save you now.

1067
01:23:11,456 --> 01:23:14,487
我在你家发现的
I found these at your home.

1068
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,991
所以  选择你的武器
So, choose your weapon.

1069
01:23:19,197 --> 01:23:25,130
是的  在我杀了你之后  我会把她活活烧死
And, yes, after I kill you I will burn her alive.

1070
01:23:27,637 --> 01:23:29,835
来吧
Come on.

1071
01:23:31,076 --> 01:23:32,943
好吧  我马上回来  好吗
Okay, I'm gonna be right back, okay?

1072
01:23:32,944 --> 01:23:33,974

1073
01:23:35,213 --> 01:23:37,343
听着  你不必这么做
Listen, you don't have to do this.

1074
01:23:38,249 --> 01:23:39,616
你为什么不杀了我放了她
Why don't you just kill me and let her go?

1075
01:23:39,617 --> 01:23:42,282
不会那么容易的
It's not going to be that easy.

1076
01:23:43,454 --> 01:23:48,954
我会杀了你的整个部落就像杀了我的一样
I will kill your whole tribe like you did mine.

1077
01:23:49,027 --> 01:23:50,127
我够不着
I can't reach it.

1078
01:23:50,128 --> 01:23:50,928
我们能开枪吗
Can we shoot it?

1079
01:23:50,929 --> 01:23:51,924
不  它会爆炸的
No, it'll blow.

1080
01:23:53,865 --> 01:23:54,894
打电话给祖国
Call Homeland.

1081
01:24:08,013 --> 01:24:09,914
你不会得逞的
You are not going to get away with this.

1082
01:24:09,915 --> 01:24:12,111
无论如何我都会死的
I'm going to die anyway!

1083
01:24:25,596 --> 01:24:27,297
国土至少10分钟
Homeland's 10 minutes at least.

1084
01:24:27,298 --> 01:24:28,398
10分钟
10 minutes?

1085
01:24:28,399 --> 01:24:30,096
我们只有不到六个
Well, we've got less than six.

1086
01:24:33,271 --> 01:24:36,969
这种死没有什么高尚的
There is nothing noble about this death.

1087
01:24:38,343 --> 01:24:42,942
但是你  你仍然可以光荣地死去
But you, you could still die with honor,

1088
01:24:45,316 --> 01:24:48,448
如果你能把这个拿走
if you can take this away from me.

1089
01:24:51,522 --> 01:24:52,722
楚其
Chucky?

1090
01:24:52,723 --> 01:24:55,025
嘿  好吧  就这样
Hey, okay, this is gonna be just like one

1091
01:24:55,026 --> 01:24:57,489
你的魔术  好吗
of your magic tricks, okay?

1092
01:24:58,796 --> 01:25:00,264
坐着别动  好吗
Just sit still right there, okay?

1093
01:25:00,265 --> 01:25:01,893
我要把电线冻住
I'm gonna try to freeze the wires.

1094
01:25:04,635 --> 01:25:05,664
该死的
Damn it.

1095
01:25:27,625 --> 01:25:29,394
我做不到
I can't get to it!

1096
01:25:30,395 --> 01:25:32,758
我只是距离不够近
I'm just not close enough.

1097
01:25:33,764 --> 01:25:35,966
是你领导了伟大的
You were the one who led the great

1098
01:25:35,967 --> 01:25:38,002
以及强大的美国军队
and powerful U.S. Army.

1099
01:25:38,003 --> 01:25:39,970
他们来教化我们
They came to civilize us,

1100
01:25:39,971 --> 01:25:41,771
以他们自己的形象塑造我们
to make us in their own image

1101
01:25:41,772 --> 01:25:43,836
就像他们对待你的人一样
just like they did your people.

1102
01:25:47,112 --> 01:25:48,946
该死  不到三分钟  我要开枪了
Damn, there's less than three minutes. I'm gonna shoot.

1103
01:25:48,947 --> 01:25:50,410
不  最后一次
No, one last try!

1104
01:25:52,617 --> 01:25:55,052
好吧  楚其  楚其

我需要你帮我

这将是有史以来最好的魔术  好吗
This is gonna be like the best magic trick ever, okay?

1108
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:00,958
我要你拿着这个罐子
I need you to take this can.

1109
01:26:00,959 --> 01:26:02,993
拿着罐子  来吧  拿着罐子
Take the can, come on, take the can.

1110
01:26:02,994 --> 01:26:06,096
我要你把它倒喷在电线上好吗
And I need you to spray it backwards on those wires okay?

1111
01:26:06,097 --> 01:26:07,731
楚其  你能行的
Chucky, you can do this!

1112
01:26:07,732 --> 01:26:09,566
为你父母做  好吗

1113
01:26:09,567 --> 01:26:10,730
你能做到的

1114
01:26:17,475 --> 01:26:18,608
她在干什么
What's she doing?

1115
01:26:18,609 --> 01:26:19,676
我不知道
I don't know.

1116
01:26:19,677 --> 01:26:20,577
怎么了
What's goin' on?

1117
01:26:20,578 --> 01:26:22,113
-我不知道  -让我看看
- I don't know. - Lemme see.

1118
01:26:22,314 --> 01:26:28,880
你以为我只有一种引爆炸弹的方法吗
Did you think I had only one way to set my bomb off?

1119
01:26:30,421 --> 01:26:32,752
她只是  啊      楚其
She's just, ah... Chucky!

1120
01:26:33,725 --> 01:26:37,862
现在你可以看着死亡降临到你的人民身上
Now you can watch death come to your people.

1121
01:26:38,063 --> 01:26:39,629

我不明白
I don't understand.

1124
01:27:18,669 --> 01:27:19,699
楚其
