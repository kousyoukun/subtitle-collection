1
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:44,590
Oh, see you
in the choir on Sunday!

2
00:02:30,257 --> 00:02:31,622
Hi, Mike.

3
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,116
Hello?

4
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:40,118
<i>Hi.</i>

5
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:41,119
Oh, hi.

6
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:42,622
<i>Been home long?</i>

7
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:45,627
No. I just got back
from the store.

8
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:47,629
<i>We're looking forward</i>
<i>to tonight.</i>

9
00:03:47,698 --> 00:03:49,131
<i>Can I bring anything?</i>

10
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,134
I think I have
everything.

11
00:03:51,202 --> 00:03:52,635
<i>Well, if there's</i>
<i>anything...</i>

12
00:03:52,705 --> 00:03:54,138
Wait.
There is something.

13
00:03:54,206 --> 00:03:56,140
Do you have any
champagne glasses?

14
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:58,143
I thought we'd start
with champagne.

15
00:03:58,212 --> 00:03:59,645
<i>We have some.</i>

16
00:03:59,715 --> 00:04:00,875
Do you have eight?

17
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,211
<i>No. We have six.</i>

18
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:05,687
Bring them. Mitch and I
will drink from jelly glasses.

19
00:04:05,756 --> 00:04:07,189
<i>You're going</i>
<i>to such trouble.</i>

20
00:04:07,257 --> 00:04:10,694
I always go to lots of
trouble for a dinner party.

21
00:04:10,763 --> 00:04:12,196
<i>I've got to run.</i>

22
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:13,697
See you
around 8:00. Bye.

23
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:14,756
<i>Bye.</i>

24
00:04:29,222 --> 00:04:31,713
Look at this floor.

25
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:35,126
I thought you love
chocolate chip cookies.

26
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:37,494
Where's that book
I gave you?

27
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,732
When I was a little girl,

28
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:47,904
this was my favorite book.

29
00:04:49,516 --> 00:04:51,950
Which one was
your favorite story?

30
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:53,919
What difference
does it make?

31
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:56,219
Let me out of here! Help!

32
00:04:56,292 --> 00:04:57,725
It's been so long,

33
00:04:57,794 --> 00:04:59,659
I almost
can't remember them.

34
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,129
Help! Let me out!

35
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,258
What are you doing?

36
00:05:03,335 --> 00:05:05,166
Just preheating
to 350.

37
00:05:05,237 --> 00:05:07,968
Help! Help! There's
a crazy woman here!

38
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,975
She's going to cook me!

39
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:12,012
She's going
to eat me! Help!

40
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,514
I never could do
long division.

41
00:05:14,584 --> 00:05:15,812
Let's see.

42
00:05:15,885 --> 00:05:20,016
How many times
does 12 go into 75?

43
00:05:20,091 --> 00:05:22,993
Oh... 6 times,
3 left over.

44
00:05:23,062 --> 00:05:24,188
Why?

45
00:05:24,263 --> 00:05:26,857
Well, at 12 minutes
a pound,

46
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:29,870
that means you have
to be in the oven

47
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:32,841
by no later than...

48
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:34,376
1:30.

49
00:05:34,444 --> 00:05:35,502
Oh...

50
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,516
but evisceration takes
at least an hour.

51
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,985
Evisceration?

52
00:05:42,055 --> 00:05:43,181
What's that?

53
00:05:43,257 --> 00:05:45,157
It's like gutting a fish.

54
00:05:45,226 --> 00:05:47,456
First you make
a long slit,

55
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:49,656
then remove everything
that isn't meat...

56
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:52,668
the heart, the lungs,
the intestines, and so forth.

57
00:05:52,736 --> 00:05:55,672
Then you fill it back up
with stuffing,

58
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,676
sew it back together
with one of these.

59
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:04,250
Maybe I should
get started now.

60
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,184
Wait. There's
plenty of time.

61
00:06:06,255 --> 00:06:08,189
This was
your favorite book.

62
00:06:08,258 --> 00:06:10,556
Don't you want
to hear a story?

63
00:06:10,628 --> 00:06:11,890
A love story?

64
00:06:11,962 --> 00:06:13,395
Yeah!
Well, not really.

65
00:06:13,465 --> 00:06:15,399
But it's a really
good one.

66
00:06:15,468 --> 00:06:17,060
You'll like it
a lot.

67
00:06:17,136 --> 00:06:18,068
Here.

68
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:20,572
It's about these
guys in college.

69
00:06:20,642 --> 00:06:23,076
They live
in the same dorm.

70
00:06:23,145 --> 00:06:25,579
And one of them's
kind of poor,

71
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:28,585
so he works his way
through school selling things.

72
00:06:28,786 --> 00:06:30,151
Hey!

73
00:06:30,221 --> 00:06:31,882
Be careful with that.

74
00:06:31,957 --> 00:06:33,549
<i>His name's Bellingham,</i>

75
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,457
<i>and he collects antiques.</i>

76
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:36,961
<i>Well, one day,</i>

77
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:40,160
<i>Bellingham got</i>
<i>a very special delivery.</i>

78
00:06:40,235 --> 00:06:43,171
<i>Meanwhile, the other guys...</i>
<i>Andy and Lee...</i>

79
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,672
<i>they were real rich.</i>

80
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:47,677
<i>And they did something</i>
<i>very nasty to Bellingham.</i>

81
00:06:47,745 --> 00:06:50,179
Lee, the most work
you've done

82
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:51,682
in four years
of college

83
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,187
is filling out that application
for the Penrose Fellowship.

84
00:06:55,256 --> 00:06:56,348
Hey...

85
00:06:56,424 --> 00:06:58,392
hard work pays off,
Andy,

86
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,826
especially when
you have a girlfriend

87
00:07:00,897 --> 00:07:03,331
who can write
award-winning essays

88
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,837
about why I want to spend
the summer traveling Europe.

89
00:07:06,905 --> 00:07:09,339
I suppose my sister's
pretty smart.

90
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:11,342
She's just not
very honest.

91
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:13,845
I don't see why
you'd risk it.

92
00:07:13,915 --> 00:07:16,851
If they learn she wrote
the proposal for you,

93
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:18,352
they'll kick you out.

94
00:07:18,421 --> 00:07:21,357
Your family sends you to Europe
every summer anyway,

95
00:07:21,425 --> 00:07:22,858
so I don't understand.

96
00:07:22,927 --> 00:07:23,894
Ah.

97
00:07:23,962 --> 00:07:26,864
But this way I have
the fellowship money

98
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:28,958
to bring back
a Maserati.

99
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:33,099
Maserati.

100
00:07:34,175 --> 00:07:36,109
Guess who was
my main competitor

101
00:07:36,178 --> 00:07:37,611
for the Penrose.

102
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:40,617
You know Bellingham works
part-time at the university museum.

103
00:07:40,685 --> 00:07:43,119
Where Susan does
volunteer work. I know.

104
00:07:43,188 --> 00:07:45,622
You better hope
he doesn't find out

105
00:07:45,692 --> 00:07:48,628
she helped you screw him
out of that fellowship.

106
00:07:48,696 --> 00:07:50,664
Bellingham has
the hots for Susan.

107
00:07:50,732 --> 00:07:52,825
Don't worry.
We'll be fine.

108
00:07:52,902 --> 00:07:54,267
Ah, Andy.

109
00:07:56,273 --> 00:07:58,070
Ah, Edward.

110
00:07:58,143 --> 00:07:59,701
How you doing?

111
00:07:59,778 --> 00:08:02,212
You going to introduce me
to your friend?

112
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,339
Uh, yeah.

113
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:04,349
This is...

114
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:05,749
Lee... Monckton,
right?

115
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:06,945
Yeah.

116
00:08:07,021 --> 00:08:09,455
Yeah. I, uh,
saw your picture

117
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:11,516
in our illustrious
college newspaper.

118
00:08:11,594 --> 00:08:12,856
Congratulations.

119
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:14,726
Oh... thank you.

120
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:17,233
It's an odd coincidence,
us meeting,

121
00:08:17,302 --> 00:08:18,735
since we're
in competition

122
00:08:18,804 --> 00:08:20,396
for the Penrose
Fellowship.

123
00:08:20,473 --> 00:08:22,407
Oh, wait, wait.
You said it.

124
00:08:22,476 --> 00:08:23,704
Competition.
Somebody...

125
00:08:23,777 --> 00:08:25,404
has to win, you know.

126
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,243
Not always
the better man.

127
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,618
Oh, no, no, no, no.

128
00:08:36,695 --> 00:08:37,684
Allow me.

129
00:08:41,902 --> 00:08:43,301
Hey, thanks.

130
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:45,805
That lot 249
was a heavy mother.

131
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:51,613
You'll get your money
back tomorrow.

132
00:08:51,683 --> 00:08:53,014
Oh, there's no rush.

133
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:54,016
Uh...

134
00:08:54,086 --> 00:08:56,020
I'll tell you what,
Edward.

135
00:08:56,088 --> 00:08:59,024
Just show us
what you have in there,

136
00:08:59,093 --> 00:09:01,961
and my friend here
will write it off.

137
00:09:04,968 --> 00:09:06,060
All right.

138
00:09:08,205 --> 00:09:11,141
If lot 249 lives up
to my expectations,

139
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:14,805
it won't matter that I was cheated
out of the Penrose.

140
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:15,848
Cheated?

141
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,816
Something unfortunate
happened to me

142
00:09:17,886 --> 00:09:19,217
before
the committee

143
00:09:19,287 --> 00:09:20,584
announced
its decision.

144
00:09:20,656 --> 00:09:22,453
What?

145
00:09:22,525 --> 00:09:24,459
I was accused
of stealing

146
00:09:24,528 --> 00:09:27,464
a pre-Columbian Zuni fetish
from the museum.

147
00:09:27,532 --> 00:09:28,897
Well...

148
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:30,093
did you?

149
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,996
I loathe Zuni aesthetics.

150
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,508
But by the time
I was cleared,

151
00:09:36,578 --> 00:09:39,012
the committee decided
in your favor.

152
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:40,013
Oh.

153
00:09:40,082 --> 00:09:43,018
Well, who was it
that accused you?

154
00:09:43,086 --> 00:09:45,749
It was
an anonymous tip.

155
00:09:45,824 --> 00:09:47,257
Oh!

156
00:09:49,896 --> 00:09:51,921
I should probably
get going.

157
00:09:51,998 --> 00:09:53,932
Susan's waiting
at home for me.

158
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:55,468
Absolutely not.

159
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,173
You're not leaving here

160
00:09:59,242 --> 00:10:01,676
until you see
what's inside lot 249.

161
00:10:01,745 --> 00:10:03,178
That was the deal.

162
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:19,569
Edward, why would you
buy something like this?

163
00:10:19,637 --> 00:10:23,096
I wasn't born with a silver
trust fund in my mouth.

164
00:10:23,175 --> 00:10:26,407
You... You can actually
sell this to somebody...

165
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,913
for a profit?

166
00:10:27,982 --> 00:10:30,975
What else
would I sell it for?

167
00:10:32,388 --> 00:10:33,753
Give me a hand.

168
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:44,534
My...

169
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:46,037
God, Andy,

170
00:10:46,107 --> 00:10:48,906
it looks just like
your father.

171
00:10:48,977 --> 00:10:49,909
Ew!

172
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,116
It stinks like rotten flowers.

173
00:10:55,386 --> 00:10:58,584
Let's see if the embalmers
did him any justice.

174
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,023
You're going
to unwrap it?

175
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,024
Why not?

176
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,527
All you're
looking at

177
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:05,293
is 3,000 years
of dry rot.

178
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:07,800
I'm going to be late.
I'm going to...

179
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,303
I'll show you out.

180
00:11:10,573 --> 00:11:12,165
See you later, Andy?

181
00:11:12,243 --> 00:11:13,835
Yeah.

182
00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:34,226
<i>4, 5, over.</i>

183
00:11:34,306 --> 00:11:36,570
<i>6. Two more.</i>

184
00:11:38,378 --> 00:11:39,640
You're back early.

185
00:11:39,713 --> 00:11:42,376
We quit after two sets.

186
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:45,852
Sounds like we lost
to Andy again.

187
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:48,857
Do you know what
your brother is doing

188
00:11:48,926 --> 00:11:51,053
right now
as we speak?

189
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,254
Huh?

190
00:11:52,331 --> 00:11:54,595
He's unwrapping
a mummy!

191
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:57,865
With Edward Fucking Bellingham!

192
00:11:57,938 --> 00:12:00,099
How much did
you tell Andy?

193
00:12:00,175 --> 00:12:01,107
Uh...

194
00:12:01,176 --> 00:12:04,271
that... that... that
you wrote the essay.

195
00:12:04,347 --> 00:12:05,837
Oh.

196
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,349
Well, that's okay.

197
00:12:07,418 --> 00:12:10,354
He knows I do
all your papers anyway.

198
00:12:10,422 --> 00:12:12,356
Oh, and then... and then,

199
00:12:12,424 --> 00:12:14,415
Bellingham
casually mentioned

200
00:12:14,494 --> 00:12:18,659
that someone dropped an
anonymous tip about the stolen...

201
00:12:18,734 --> 00:12:21,465
Pre-Columbian
Zuni fetish?

202
00:12:21,538 --> 00:12:22,664
He's guessing.

203
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:26,642
Well, maybe, but I think
Andy knows it was you.

204
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:28,144
Andy's my brother.

205
00:12:28,213 --> 00:12:30,443
He won't do anything.

206
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,643
And Bellingham's
a loser.

207
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,846
He can't do anything.

208
00:12:41,732 --> 00:12:44,668
I've really got to
get ready for dinner.

209
00:12:44,736 --> 00:12:48,002
Don't you want
to see his face?

210
00:12:48,074 --> 00:12:49,507
No. Thank you.

211
00:13:15,645 --> 00:13:18,113
He looks pissed off.

212
00:13:18,182 --> 00:13:20,013
Like he's thinking.

213
00:13:20,085 --> 00:13:21,518
He's not thinking
anything.

214
00:13:21,587 --> 00:13:23,817
The first thing
the embalmers did

215
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:26,289
was stick a hook
up his nose,

216
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,091
then drag his brain out
through his nostrils.

217
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:41,843
Here's where they cut him open
to remove his innards.

218
00:13:41,914 --> 00:13:46,079
Then they stuff him
with flowers and spices.

219
00:13:46,154 --> 00:13:47,712
Here, hold this open.

220
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:51,025
Come on,
hold this open.

221
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,428
Ohh.

222
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,939
Myrrh.

223
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,408
Cassia.

224
00:14:11,422 --> 00:14:12,946
Onions.

225
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:17,955
And...

226
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,298
What?
Onions and what?

227
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,303
A fortune cookie.

228
00:14:45,535 --> 00:14:47,093
What does it say?

229
00:14:49,174 --> 00:14:50,266
Uh...

230
00:14:50,342 --> 00:14:52,105
I have no idea.

231
00:14:52,178 --> 00:14:55,615
Do you know how to read
Third Kingdom hieroglyphics?

232
00:15:10,403 --> 00:15:13,840
You're taking those books
back to the library now?

233
00:15:13,908 --> 00:15:15,341
They're three months
overdue.

234
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,847
And I thought I'd
stop by to see Andy

235
00:15:18,915 --> 00:15:20,348
on the way home.

236
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:23,352
You don't care about
those books or Andy.

237
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:25,480
You're going to
go see Bellingham.

238
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,491
I give him a hard-on.

239
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,553
I'll talk to him,
throw him off the track.

240
00:15:39,277 --> 00:15:41,404
Zuni fetish.

241
00:15:43,048 --> 00:15:44,140
Hmm.

242
00:16:01,473 --> 00:16:03,407
<i>They use their second timeout.</i>

243
00:16:03,476 --> 00:16:04,909

Hey, Bellingham!

267
00:17:04,394 --> 00:17:05,884
Hey, Bellingham, come on.

268
00:17:05,962 --> 00:17:08,898
The fuse box is
right outside your door.

269
00:17:19,314 --> 00:17:20,576
Christ.

270
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:26,156
Come on, Bellingham.
It's the end of the playoffs.

271
00:17:26,223 --> 00:17:27,656
I mean, Christ.

272
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:33,063
Oh.

273
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:34,760
God.

274
00:17:36,338 --> 00:17:37,362
Hey.

275
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:38,701
You okay?

276
00:17:38,774 --> 00:17:39,968
Yeah.

277
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,169
Jesus!

278
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:49,955
What the hell
are you doing here?

279
00:17:50,023 --> 00:17:52,959
I just... I just
thought I'd stop by.

280
00:17:53,027 --> 00:17:55,963
What's going on?
Somebody just knocked me down.

281
00:17:56,031 --> 00:17:58,465
Look, you two
just wait here.

282
00:17:58,534 --> 00:17:59,967
Don't go after him!

283
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,402
Go after who?

284
00:18:01,472 --> 00:18:02,905
Um...

285
00:18:02,974 --> 00:18:04,373
a thief.

286
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,362
Damn fuses.

287
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:28,732
Well...

288
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,869
he couldn't
have taken much.

289
00:18:32,748 --> 00:18:34,682
Would you like
some brandy?

290
00:18:34,751 --> 00:18:36,082
Thank you.

291
00:19:00,754 --> 00:19:02,847
Did you see him?

292
00:19:02,923 --> 00:19:04,083
No.

293
00:19:05,593 --> 00:19:08,529
Not really, but he did look
a little weird.

294
00:19:08,598 --> 00:19:10,532
Yes, he was very weird.

295
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,534
He must've been on drugs.

296
00:19:12,603 --> 00:19:14,537
Got off
with my rings.

297
00:19:14,606 --> 00:19:16,039
Roman stuff.
Hollow gold.

298
00:19:16,108 --> 00:19:19,442
At least he didn't get away
with lot 249.

299
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:24,950
No!

300

Andy.

use this, huh?

What?

321
00:23:46,915 --> 00:23:49,612
I saw who
killed Lee.

322
00:23:51,387 --> 00:23:52,945
He was thin...

325
00:23:56,828 --> 00:23:58,728

that this was
one of the museum's

most unusual pieces.

331

00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:21,557
What a sensual
candlestick.

334
00:24:22,697 --> 00:24:24,289
Take your hands off that.

335
00:24:25,434 --> 00:24:27,163
Good evening,
Mr. Smith.

336
00:24:27,237 --> 00:24:28,169
Dean Murray.

337
00:24:28,238 --> 00:24:30,866
Andy, do you
know Dr. Carey,

338
00:24:30,941 --> 00:24:33,000
the curator of
the university museum?

339
00:24:33,078 --> 00:24:34,306
Uh...

340
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:35,505
hi.

341
00:24:37,618 --> 00:24:39,051
What's going on,
Edward?

342
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:42,146
I'm a little busy
right now, Andy.

343
00:24:42,223 --> 00:24:43,281
Yes.

344
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,190
Mr. Bellingham
is packing.

345
00:24:45,262 --> 00:24:47,127
He's leaving
the university.

346
00:24:47,197 --> 00:24:48,323
Oh!

347
00:24:50,134 --> 00:24:51,101
Pity.

348
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:53,603
Would have been
a nice acquisition

349
00:24:53,673 --> 00:24:56,107
if the mummy
had come with it.

350
00:24:58,245 --> 00:25:00,179
What happened
to the mummy?

351
00:25:16,771 --> 00:25:19,205
He never did have taste.

352
00:25:23,247 --> 00:25:26,183
I don't care how cheap
the psychology is.

353
00:25:26,251 --> 00:25:29,449
I still hate these
stupid chrysanthemums.

354
00:25:49,516 --> 00:25:51,450
I'm aware of that,
operator.

355
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:54,956
I've been trying to get
through for a half hour.

356
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:57,752
Help!

357
00:25:57,828 --> 00:25:59,227
Police!

358
00:25:59,297 --> 00:26:01,765
Please, somebody help me!

359
00:26:21,961 --> 00:26:23,428
Susan!

360
00:26:23,497 --> 00:26:24,725
Susan!

361
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:31,929
Jesus.

362
00:26:37,682 --> 00:26:39,115
Jesus.

363
00:27:03,017 --> 00:27:04,575
Damned fuses.

364
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:27,081
Hey!

365
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,912
Oh, you're awake.

366
00:27:54,688 --> 00:27:56,121
That's my master's
thesis.

367
00:27:56,191 --> 00:27:57,624
What are you doing?

368
00:27:59,061 --> 00:28:03,226
Well, I'm going to start
a little fire under your chair

369
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,961
and roast your nuts.

370
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,128
Why?

371
00:28:07,206 --> 00:28:09,333
Because you
killed my sister

372
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:10,842
and my best friend.

373
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:11,842
That's why.

374
00:28:11,912 --> 00:28:13,743
I didn't kill them.

375
00:28:13,814 --> 00:28:17,216
Right. Right.
Your friend lot 249 did.

376
00:28:21,592 --> 00:28:24,220
Ah. I thought
he'd be back.

377
00:28:25,564 --> 00:28:28,659
The alleged perpetrator's
got an airtight alibi.

378
00:28:28,735 --> 00:28:31,226
He's been dead
for 3,000 years.

379
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,274
Then these should make
for excellent kindling.

380
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:43,250
Oh, Andy, you're crazy.

381
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:48,661
Ooh, damn, I think
I forgot my matches.

382
00:28:50,665 --> 00:28:52,394
Grow, grow, o light.

383
00:28:52,468 --> 00:28:54,163
Ascend, o light.

384
00:28:54,237 --> 00:28:56,603
Rise, o light.
Come forth, o light.

385
00:28:56,673 --> 00:28:58,971
O darkness, remove, re...

386
00:28:59,043 --> 00:29:00,943
Shit, how does it go?

387
00:29:01,013 --> 00:29:02,742
Remove thyself from them.

388
00:29:02,815 --> 00:29:04,476
Open, tat. Open, nap.

389
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,882
Open his eyes.

390
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:09,252
Open his eyes.
Open...

391
00:29:09,324 --> 00:29:10,416
Edward,

392
00:29:10,493 --> 00:29:12,791
I believe
in being prepared.

393
00:29:12,863 --> 00:29:14,296
Eh?

394
00:29:14,364 --> 00:29:17,425
Batteries in case
those fuses blow again.

395
00:29:28,383 --> 00:29:31,080
Need a hand up there,
fella? Huh?

396
00:29:35,627 --> 00:29:36,958
Jesus.

397
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:51,506
Edward...

398
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:53,573
I'm not going
to apologize

399
00:29:53,652 --> 00:29:56,781
for what Lee and Susan
did to you.

400
00:29:56,856 --> 00:30:00,258
I won't call the cops either,
because what sane person

401
00:30:00,327 --> 00:30:03,263
would believe that
a 3,000-year-old mummy

402
00:30:03,332 --> 00:30:06,427
really did come
back to life anyway?

403
00:30:06,503 --> 00:30:08,903
But I do have another idea.

404
00:30:50,764 --> 00:30:53,666
Well, that takes care
of that, doesn't it?

405
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,680
Would you untie me,
please?

406
00:31:09,457 --> 00:31:10,890
Yeah, of course.

407
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:14,861
As soon as you tell me
where the scroll is.

408
00:31:14,931 --> 00:31:16,865
You don't need
the scroll.

409
00:31:16,933 --> 00:31:19,367
It only worked
for that mummy,

410
00:31:19,436 --> 00:31:21,165
which you've
totally destroyed.

411
00:31:32,754 --> 00:31:36,191
The second drawer in the desk
on the right.

412
00:32:05,066 --> 00:32:06,795
It's irreplaceable.

413
00:32:06,868 --> 00:32:09,063
Yeah,
I certainly hope so.

414
00:32:15,681 --> 00:32:18,344
That scroll would have made
my entire career.

415
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,550
My sister and my best friend
died because of this.

416
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:27,026
Killing me won't
bring them back.

417
00:32:28,598 --> 00:32:32,160
If I let you live,
that will bring them back?

418
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:45,109
Don't worry, Andy.

419
00:32:45,188 --> 00:32:47,281
You'll never
see me again.

420
00:32:48,392 --> 00:32:51,726
But I'll find a way
to keep in touch.

421
00:32:52,966 --> 00:32:54,558
Open, tat.
Open, nap.

422
00:32:54,634 --> 00:32:57,968
Bind them both
to my service

423
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:01,669
and to the gods
of death, terror...

424
00:33:01,744 --> 00:33:03,644
and revenge.

425
00:33:04,748 --> 00:33:06,181
Ha ha ha!

426
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,309
Hey, man, what's so
fucking funny?

427
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:13,025
I was just thinking
of this guy I know.

428
00:33:13,093 --> 00:33:16,029
Couldn't distinguish
a Third Dynasty sacred scroll

429
00:33:16,097 --> 00:33:19,898
from a piece of post-Alexandrian
pictogram porn.

430
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,405
Ha ha ha!

431
00:33:24,476 --> 00:33:27,537
Ha ha ha!

432
00:33:27,613 --> 00:33:31,550
Mom, I'll be home as soon
as finals are over.

433
00:33:32,654 --> 00:33:35,647
Yeah, the funeral
was hard on me, too.

434
00:33:37,459 --> 00:33:40,395
No, the police don't
have any leads yet.

435
00:33:40,464 --> 00:33:41,396
All right?

436
00:33:41,465 --> 00:33:43,695
I'll see you
next week.

437
00:33:43,769 --> 00:33:44,701
Bye.

438
00:33:49,143 --> 00:33:50,075
Andy?

439
00:33:55,251 --> 00:33:58,585
Bellingham
sends his regards.

440
00:34:01,092 --> 00:34:03,560
Antiques
are so fascinating.

441
00:34:03,629 --> 00:34:05,563
You told that
very well.

442
00:34:05,632 --> 00:34:06,564
Thank you.

443
00:34:06,633 --> 00:34:08,066
Goodness,
it's almost 1:00.

444
00:34:08,135 --> 00:34:10,467
We've got to
get things started.

445
00:34:10,539 --> 00:34:12,973
You know, if I'm
not home by 6:00,

446
00:34:13,042 --> 00:34:14,304
they'll come looking.

447
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,745
Looking for what,
dear?

448
00:34:22,823 --> 00:34:23,755
Uh... wait.

449
00:34:23,824 --> 00:34:26,019
I'll tell you
another story.

450
00:34:26,094 --> 00:34:27,220
Put the book away.

451
00:34:27,295 --> 00:34:29,661
But it's the best
story yet.

452
00:34:29,732 --> 00:34:32,360
I stopped reading twice
because I got scared.

453
00:34:32,435 --> 00:34:35,098
It's about the old man
who's so rich

454
00:34:35,172 --> 00:34:38,404
and lives in this
big house all by himself.

455
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:40,911
Okay. This'll be
the last story,

456
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,083
and you have to
make it quick.

457
00:34:43,217 --> 00:34:45,276
I will. I promise.

458
00:34:45,353 --> 00:34:48,152
It's about this old man
named Drogan.

459
00:34:48,224 --> 00:34:51,160
Old man Drogan
had this big problem,

460
00:34:51,228 --> 00:34:53,993
so he hired this man
to help him,

461
00:34:54,065 --> 00:34:56,899
<i>a very</i>
<i>professional man.</i>

462
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:28,344
It's already
taken care of, pal.

463
00:35:28,412 --> 00:35:29,777
Here,
Mr. Halston.

464
00:35:29,848 --> 00:35:31,179
Here!

465
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,516
You are Mr. Halston,
aren't you?

466
00:35:35,589 --> 00:35:36,749
That's me.

467
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:38,689
Tell the driver
to wait.

468
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,622
The man says
you should wait.

469
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,568
For what this guy's paying,
I ain't going nowhere.

470
00:35:46,638 --> 00:35:48,367
Take your time.

471
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,157
In here,
Mr. Halston.

472
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,663
In here.

473
00:36:21,252 --> 00:36:24,188
I want you
to make a hit.

474
00:36:24,256 --> 00:36:27,192
That is what you do,
I understand.

475
00:36:27,261 --> 00:36:29,695
How did you
get my name?

476
00:36:29,763 --> 00:36:32,357
A Mr. Saul Loggia

477
00:36:32,434 --> 00:36:34,629
told me
that you know him.

478
00:36:36,106 --> 00:36:38,040
Who do you
want hit?

479
00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:42,513
Your victim
is right behind you.

480
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:50,891
I ought to
kill you for that.

481
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,483
I don't like jokes.

482
00:36:52,562 --> 00:36:53,927
I don't make jokes.

483
00:36:53,998 --> 00:36:55,226
Sit down.

484
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:56,231
Here.

485
00:37:00,139 --> 00:37:02,232
Sit down,
Mr. Halston,

486
00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:04,243
and look in
that envelope.

487
00:37:17,262 --> 00:37:19,822
$50,000.

488
00:37:19,899 --> 00:37:22,459
There will be
another 50,000

489
00:37:22,536 --> 00:37:24,470
when you
bring me proof

490
00:37:24,539 --> 00:37:27,941
that the cat has
ended its time on earth.

491
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,375
I don't believe this.

492
00:37:29,446 --> 00:37:32,473
You're hiring me
to kill a cat?

493
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,146
That cat has
killed three people

494
00:37:36,222 --> 00:37:38,053
in this household.

495
00:37:38,124 --> 00:37:39,648
That leaves me.

496
00:37:41,228 --> 00:37:43,162
I need not
explain anything,

497
00:37:43,231 --> 00:37:44,664
but I will.

498
00:37:44,734 --> 00:37:48,171
In fact, I feel the need
to justify myself

499
00:37:48,238 --> 00:37:50,672
so you won't
think me mad.

500
00:37:57,084 --> 00:37:58,949
This is
quite a mansion,

501
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,885
don't you think,
Mr. Halston?

502
00:38:00,956 --> 00:38:02,389
Quite a mansion.

503
00:38:03,526 --> 00:38:04,959
Help me up.

504
00:38:09,034 --> 00:38:10,467
Over the years

505
00:38:10,535 --> 00:38:13,630
lfilled this place
with everything,

506
00:38:13,707 --> 00:38:15,140
everything
you could want,

507
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,940
everything
you could ever want.

508
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:24,153
There used to be
four of us living here...

509
00:38:25,223 --> 00:38:26,713
<i>myself</i>

510
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:28,453
<i>and Carolyn Broadmoor,</i>

511
00:38:28,527 --> 00:38:33,761
<i>the only friend</i>
<i>of my sister Amanda.</i>

512
00:38:35,737 --> 00:38:38,171
<i>And Richard Gage,</i>
<i>a hired man</i>

513
00:38:38,241 --> 00:38:41,109
<i>with the family</i>
<i>almost 20 years.</i>

514
00:38:42,747 --> 00:38:46,013
<i>We were</i>
<i>a dull collection</i>

515
00:38:46,085 --> 00:38:48,782
<i>of rich, old,</i>
<i>unhappy people.</i>

516
00:38:53,595 --> 00:38:54,857
<i>Then...</i>

517
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,693
<i>the cat came.</i>

518
00:39:00,704 --> 00:39:03,640
<i>It was Gage</i>
<i>who saw it first.</i>

519
00:39:04,877 --> 00:39:09,212
<i>He tried repeatedly</i>
<i>to scare it away,</i>

520
00:39:09,284 --> 00:39:12,152
<i>but every time</i>
<i>he drove it off,</i>

521
00:39:12,221 --> 00:39:14,348
<i>it kept coming back.</i>

522
00:39:16,393 --> 00:39:17,655
<i>Finally,</i>

523
00:39:17,728 --> 00:39:20,994
<i>my sister Amanda</i>
<i>noticed the animal.</i>

524
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:23,091
<i>She's the one</i>

525
00:39:23,169 --> 00:39:24,602
<i>who took it in.</i>

526
00:39:24,671 --> 00:39:28,164
Oh, the poor
little thing.

527
00:39:28,243 --> 00:39:30,177
It's starving.

528
00:39:30,246 --> 00:39:31,679
Is Oo hungry,
darling?

529
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,683
Is Oo hungry?

530
00:39:36,254 --> 00:39:38,188
Cats aggravate
emphysema, Carolyn.

531
00:39:38,257 --> 00:39:40,589
Get rid of
the filthy thing.

532
00:39:40,659 --> 00:39:42,593
Cats aggravate
my brother, Carolyn.

533
00:39:42,662 --> 00:39:44,186
Don't pay
any attention.

534
00:39:44,265 --> 00:39:46,699
I want it
out of here!

535
00:39:46,768 --> 00:39:49,202
Either out of here
or dead!

536
00:39:49,272 --> 00:39:51,638
Which is it to be?

537
00:39:51,709 --> 00:39:53,142
Don't you ever

538
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:55,144
dare to hurt
this cat!

539
00:39:56,448 --> 00:39:58,712
You hate cats.
You always have.

540
00:39:58,784 --> 00:40:01,218
You're wrong.
I don't hate cats.

541
00:40:01,288 --> 00:40:04,725
Cats hate me.
Don't you see?

542
00:40:04,793 --> 00:40:07,729
We're all in danger
while this animal's here!

543
00:40:07,797 --> 00:40:10,231
You'll find out!
You'll find out!

544
00:40:10,301 --> 00:40:11,233
You'll...

545
00:40:17,811 --> 00:40:19,244
You all right?

546
00:40:20,314 --> 00:40:21,679
I'll be fine.

547
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,753
I'll be fine.

548
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:33,264
You know who I am,
don't you?

549
00:40:33,332 --> 00:40:36,200
That is, where
my money comes from?

550
00:40:37,338 --> 00:40:39,329
Drogan Pharmaceuticals.

551
00:40:39,408 --> 00:40:41,774
One of the biggest
drug companies

552
00:40:41,844 --> 00:40:43,778
in America, Mr. Halston.

553
00:40:43,846 --> 00:40:47,112
And the cornerstone
of our financial success

554
00:40:47,185 --> 00:40:49,517
has always been this.

555
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:54,127
Tri-Dormal-Phenobarbin,

556
00:40:54,194 --> 00:40:56,857
compound "G."

557
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,691
Good old Tri-Dormal-G.

558
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:04,571
A combination painkiller,
tranquilizer...

559
00:41:04,642 --> 00:41:07,236
and mild hallucinogen.

560
00:41:07,312 --> 00:41:09,746
Remarkably helpful
to those of us fighting

561
00:41:09,816 --> 00:41:13,378
the debilitating effects
of an aging heart.

562
00:41:13,455 --> 00:41:16,584
It's also
remarkably expensive.

563
00:41:16,659 --> 00:41:19,390
It's also remarkably
habit-forming.

564
00:41:20,998 --> 00:41:24,025
I've read
all about it, Drogan.

565
00:41:24,103 --> 00:41:27,471
That stuff is one step
up from street junk.

566
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,772
You've obviously
done very well with it.

567
00:41:30,845 --> 00:41:33,109
And you've
done well yourself.

568
00:41:33,181 --> 00:41:37,346
Saul Loggia knows of
at least two dozen jobs

569
00:41:37,421 --> 00:41:43,129
you have done for various members
of the professional community.

570
00:41:43,262 --> 00:41:44,627
All right.

571
00:41:44,697 --> 00:41:47,633
We each know who it is
we're dealing with.

572
00:41:50,873 --> 00:41:53,809
Tell me the rest
of the story

573
00:41:53,877 --> 00:41:55,310
about that cat.

574
00:41:55,378 --> 00:41:56,310
Ah, yes.

575
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,371
The cat
killed them.

576
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:01,248
I warned them,
but they wouldn't listen.

577
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,753
They found out.

578
00:42:02,822 --> 00:42:04,255
They found out.

579
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,261
<i>My sister</i>
<i>was the first to die.</i>

580
00:42:09,331 --> 00:42:11,265
<i>It was midnight.</i>

581
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:14,269
<i>She was on her way</i>
<i>to the kitchen</i>

582
00:42:14,337 --> 00:42:17,273
<i>to get that evil beast</i>
<i>some food.</i>

583
00:42:17,342 --> 00:42:19,003
<i>We heard her scream.</i>

584
00:42:32,863 --> 00:42:34,296
Amanda?

585
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:36,298
Amanda?

586
00:42:36,368 --> 00:42:38,302
What happened, Amanda?

587
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:44,033
<i>Death by accident,</i>
<i>the coroner said.</i>

588
00:42:44,112 --> 00:42:46,877
<i>But I knew.</i>

589
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:56,327
Why didn't you get rid
of the cat then?

590
00:42:56,395 --> 00:42:58,329
I tried,
Mr. Halston.

591
00:42:58,398 --> 00:43:00,332
I tried.

592
00:43:01,336 --> 00:43:02,769
I'll kill it!

593
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,170
Let me have it!

594
00:43:05,242 --> 00:43:06,675
I'll kill it!

595
00:43:06,743 --> 00:43:08,973
<i>Carolyn locked</i>
<i>the damn thing</i>

596
00:43:09,046 --> 00:43:10,536
<i>in her room.</i>

597
00:43:10,616 --> 00:43:12,481
<i>She became obsessed</i>
<i>with the animal.</i>

598
00:43:12,551 --> 00:43:15,419
I'm going to kill it!
Do you hear me?

599
00:43:15,489 --> 00:43:18,288
I'll kill it!
I'll kill, kill, kill!

600
00:43:19,527 --> 00:43:20,960
<i>My mother told me</i>

601
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:24,330
<i>that cats like to get babies</i>
<i>and old people</i>

602
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:28,429
<i>when they're asleep</i>
<i>and steal their breath.</i>

603
00:44:02,186 --> 00:44:04,620
Carolyn died
at midnight as well.

604
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:06,282
Suffocated in her bed.

605
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:09,796
The coroner said
natural causes in her case,

606
00:44:09,863 --> 00:44:10,852
but again,

607
00:44:10,931 --> 00:44:13,161
I knew.

608
00:44:15,204 --> 00:44:17,069
What did you do then?

609
00:44:18,709 --> 00:44:22,646
I told Gage to get rid
of the vile thing.

610
00:44:22,715 --> 00:44:24,808
It took him
almost 24 hours

611
00:44:24,884 --> 00:44:27,649
to find the cat
and capture it.

612
00:44:27,722 --> 00:44:29,656
Without concern
for the time,

613
00:44:29,725 --> 00:44:32,661
I sent him out to Milford
to the veterinarian...

614
00:44:34,898 --> 00:44:38,835
to have the beast put
away once and for all.

615
00:44:38,903 --> 00:44:41,337
I phoned ahead
to the vet.

616
00:44:41,407 --> 00:44:42,840
"Mr. Drogan," he said,

617
00:44:42,909 --> 00:44:44,342
"it's midnight."

618
00:45:42,257 --> 00:45:44,350
A week later,

619
00:45:44,427 --> 00:45:48,194
the day Dick Gage
was buried,

620
00:45:48,265 --> 00:45:50,790
the cat came back.

621
00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:53,805
No one actually witnessed
any of these deaths.

622
00:45:53,873 --> 00:45:55,306
What makes you think

623
00:45:55,375 --> 00:45:58,539
this cat had anything
to do with it?

624
00:45:58,613 --> 00:46:00,547
I'm sure
it killed them.

625
00:46:00,616 --> 00:46:01,981
It killed
them all.

626
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:03,951
And I'm next!

627
00:46:05,723 --> 00:46:07,657
I'm afraid of it,
Halston.

628
00:46:07,726 --> 00:46:10,160
It skulks around
in the shadows,

629
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:11,162
watching me.

630
00:46:11,231 --> 00:46:12,163
It's waiting.

631
00:46:12,232 --> 00:46:14,826
It's torturing me
by waiting.

632
00:46:14,902 --> 00:46:17,770
It's been sent
to punish me.

633
00:46:19,075 --> 00:46:20,440
I don't get it.

634
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:25,143
Tri-Dormal-G.

635
00:46:25,216 --> 00:46:27,081
That's what
it's about.

636
00:46:27,152 --> 00:46:28,779
It's a synthetic,

637
00:46:28,855 --> 00:46:32,314
developed in our laboratories
in New Jersey.

638
00:46:32,393 --> 00:46:34,827
Our testing
of Tri-Dormal-G

639
00:46:34,897 --> 00:46:37,127
was confined almost
solely to cats

640
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,929
because of
the unique quality

641
00:46:39,002 --> 00:46:41,232
of the feline
nervous system.

642
00:46:41,305 --> 00:46:43,466
How many
did you eliminate?

643
00:46:43,542 --> 00:46:46,205
Over four years
of testing...

644
00:46:46,279 --> 00:46:47,644
5,000 cats.

645
00:46:53,122 --> 00:46:55,556
5,000 of your buddies
get wasted,

646
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:59,062
and they send <i>you</i> back
to settle the score

647
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:00,597
with Drogan here,

648
00:47:00,666 --> 00:47:02,600
is that the deal,
pussycat?

649
00:47:02,668 --> 00:47:05,832
Don't make light
of it, Halston.

650
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,669
I warn you.

651
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:15,509
I never make light of any matter
involving $ 100,000.

652
00:47:15,586 --> 00:47:18,054
Then you'll
take the job?

653
00:47:18,122 --> 00:47:21,684
I could do it now
if you want me to.

654
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,696
I could put my hands
around its neck

655
00:47:24,765 --> 00:47:26,198
and snap it.

656
00:47:30,506 --> 00:47:31,939
Son of a bitch!

657
00:47:33,277 --> 00:47:36,543
It's not going to be
that easy, Mr. Halston.

658
00:47:37,616 --> 00:47:38,878
Don't worry, Drogan.

659
00:47:38,951 --> 00:47:41,283
I'll kill your cat
for you.

660
00:47:41,355 --> 00:47:44,792
Good. Kill it, bury it
and bring me its tail

661
00:47:44,859 --> 00:47:49,559
so I can throw it in the fire
and watch it burn.

662
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,066
I'm going into the city.

663
00:47:51,135 --> 00:47:54,401
That's why I made
the taxi wait.

664
00:47:54,473 --> 00:47:56,907
There's food, there's liquor,
there's everything.

665
00:47:56,976 --> 00:47:58,568
Everything
you could want.

666
00:48:00,814 --> 00:48:02,679
Everything
you could ever want.

667
00:48:34,461 --> 00:48:35,621
Okay, cat.

668
00:48:36,798 --> 00:48:39,232
It's just
you and me now.

669
00:48:39,301 --> 00:48:41,895
Jesus Christ.

670
00:48:41,971 --> 00:48:43,404
Crazy old fucker.

671
00:48:44,975 --> 00:48:46,567
Crazy old <i>rich</i> fucker.

672
00:48:49,147 --> 00:48:51,081
How about it,
kitty cat?

673
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:29,568
"Everything
you could ever want."

674
00:49:30,805 --> 00:49:34,742
Why is it rich guys always
buy the cheap stuff?

675
00:49:34,811 --> 00:49:36,244
Look at this shit.

676
00:49:37,482 --> 00:49:38,574
Hey, cat!

677
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:43,255
For me, it's nothing
but the best.

678
00:49:44,491 --> 00:49:45,924
All the time.

679
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,534
"Everything
you could ever want."

680
00:49:52,602 --> 00:49:53,762
Shit.

681
00:50:07,523 --> 00:50:09,115
Hey, you little
motherfucker!

682
00:50:09,192 --> 00:50:10,784
Nobody hits me twice!

683
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:13,294
No fucking body
hits me twice!

684
00:50:21,542 --> 00:50:22,975
Can't get hot.

685
00:50:24,045 --> 00:50:26,479
Can't let yourself
get hot, ever.

686
00:50:27,551 --> 00:50:29,985
You make mistakes
when you're hot.

687
00:50:39,567 --> 00:50:41,000
What is this?

688
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,006
What is this shit?

689
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:51,413
Oh, no!

690
00:50:52,484 --> 00:50:53,508
No!

691
00:50:57,758 --> 00:51:00,158
This is a $ 100 shirt.

692
00:51:05,102 --> 00:51:07,036
You'll be sorry
you messed with me,

693
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,197
you little shit.

694
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:12,977
I got a reason
to kill you now.

695
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:19,665
Drogan,
you cheap bastard.

696
00:52:31,787 --> 00:52:36,350
Come on, kitty cat.
Let's be friends again.

697
00:52:36,427 --> 00:52:39,795
We can go over
by the fire like before.

698
00:52:39,866 --> 00:52:42,300
You can sit
on my lap again,

699
00:52:42,369 --> 00:52:44,530
and I'll give you
a nice boost.

700
00:52:50,481 --> 00:52:52,881
This is the real stuff,
kitty cat.

701
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:57,217
Not like that cheap crap
Drogan sells.

702
00:52:57,289 --> 00:52:58,881
What do you say?

703
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,808
You're beating me, pal.

704
00:53:12,978 --> 00:53:14,946
You're beating me good.

705
00:53:16,182 --> 00:53:18,309
I'm trying too hard.

706
00:53:23,259 --> 00:53:24,726
Hey, cat...

707
00:53:25,962 --> 00:53:28,021
I've never
blown a hit yet.

708
00:53:28,099 --> 00:53:29,760
It's just a matter of time.

709
00:53:32,037 --> 00:53:33,368
Get away!

710
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,839
Get off of me!

711
00:53:56,705 --> 00:53:59,470
You're done for,
you fuck.

712
00:53:59,542 --> 00:54:02,341
The rest
of your nine lives

713
00:54:02,413 --> 00:54:05,850
are going in one lump sum.

714
00:54:16,565 --> 00:54:19,694
I can outwait you,
you little shit.

715
00:54:37,361 --> 00:54:40,559
I've never blown
a hit yet, kitty cat.

716
00:54:41,867 --> 00:54:44,028
This is the end of you.

717
00:54:47,174 --> 00:54:49,335
That's impossible.

718
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:51,173
Fucking impossible!

719
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:53,544
I had a dead bead
on you.

720
00:54:58,189 --> 00:54:59,816
Where are you?

721
00:55:04,031 --> 00:55:07,160
You son of a bitch,
I know you're in here.

722
00:56:50,043 --> 00:56:51,533
Oh, no.

723
00:56:53,448 --> 00:56:54,915
No.

724
00:58:01,642 --> 00:58:04,908
My goodness,
that was a scary story.

725
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:07,471
But my favorites
were the love stories.

726
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:11,248
Uh, yeah. There's one story
in that book that's really scary.

727
00:58:11,322 --> 00:58:13,586
But it's
a love story, too.

728
00:58:13,659 --> 00:58:14,591
Really?

729
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:15,991
Yeah.

730
00:58:16,061 --> 00:58:17,585
Which one was that?

731
00:58:17,664 --> 00:58:19,689
The one
that's in New York.

732
00:58:19,767 --> 00:58:22,760
You still have to cook
for quite a while,

733
00:58:22,838 --> 00:58:25,272
but I'd love
to hear the story.

734
00:58:25,341 --> 00:58:29,142
"There's a part of New York
that's busy during the day,

735
00:58:29,213 --> 00:58:31,944
"but late at night when
hardly anyone is around,

736
00:58:32,017 --> 00:58:33,348
<i>"strange things</i>
<i>sometimes happen.</i>

737
00:58:33,419 --> 00:58:36,150
<i>"10 years ago,</i>
<i>on a cold, dreary night,</i>

738
00:58:36,223 --> 00:58:38,851
<i>"an artist named Preston</i>

739
00:58:38,927 --> 00:58:41,521
<i>saw something</i>
<i>very, very strange."

740
00:59:29,262 --> 00:59:31,287
Oh, yes. Wyatt.

741
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,534
Hello.

742
00:59:38,609 --> 00:59:40,406
Preston, it's Jer.

743
00:59:40,478 --> 00:59:41,740
There's a guy here...

744
00:59:41,813 --> 00:59:44,942
Fortyish, anal retentive
type, right?

745
00:59:45,018 --> 00:59:46,042
On the money.

746
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:48,987
Tell him I've been waiting
half an hour.

747
00:59:50,058 --> 00:59:52,492
He's been waiting
half an hour.

748
01:00:04,945 --> 01:00:07,813
Another Drambuie
on the rocks, please.

749
01:00:12,622 --> 01:00:14,419
This one's on him.

750
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:20,996
4.50.

751
01:00:21,068 --> 01:00:22,968
Keep it.

752
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,003
Wyatt, I'm sorry.

753
01:00:24,072 --> 01:00:26,803
I was just working
on a new piece.

754
01:00:26,875 --> 01:00:27,842
Ah, come here.

755
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:29,935
Hey, Jer.
Give me a Holsten.

756
01:00:31,549 --> 01:00:33,949
So, did you
bring me a check

757
01:00:34,018 --> 01:00:36,418
or just a lot of cash?

758
01:00:36,488 --> 01:00:38,320
Thanks, Jer.

759
01:00:38,391 --> 01:00:42,192
Judith says she hasn't moved
anything of yours in four months.

760
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:46,724
Judith Amato.
Big gallery on West Broadway.

761
01:00:46,802 --> 01:00:50,534
If it isn't out by tomorrow,
it gets junked.

762
01:00:50,608 --> 01:00:54,636
What? Wyatt, you've got
to convince her that l...

763
01:00:54,713 --> 01:00:57,444
I can't convince her
of anything.

764
01:00:57,517 --> 01:01:00,316
Wyatt, you're my agent.

765
01:01:00,387 --> 01:01:04,347
Well, not exactly.

766
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:11,096
Preston, your artistic vision
is just not a marketable commodity.

767
01:01:11,169 --> 01:01:14,367
Wyatt, I'm broke.
I can't live on nothing.

768
01:01:14,441 --> 01:01:17,240
And I can't live
on 10% of nothing.

769
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,907
You're a monster.

770
01:01:22,385 --> 01:01:24,182
I'm an agent.

771
01:01:25,956 --> 01:01:29,358
For an agent, being a monster
is just credentials.

772
01:01:32,331 --> 01:01:34,231
I'm sorry, Preston.

773
01:01:47,986 --> 01:01:49,248
Fuck you!

774
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:55,796
Jesus, what am I
supposed to do now?

775
01:02:02,073 --> 01:02:04,234
Ah, Jesus.

776
01:02:12,086 --> 01:02:17,115
There's Van Gogh.
Degas. Rodin.

777
01:02:18,462 --> 01:02:20,123
They didn't have agents.

778
01:02:20,198 --> 01:02:23,566
How'd they
get so successful?

779
01:02:23,636 --> 01:02:25,695
They died.

780
01:02:28,008 --> 01:02:31,001
Time to put it to bed,
Preston.

781
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,445
All right.

782
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:35,174
What about Maddox?

783
01:02:36,587 --> 01:02:38,578
Let him out
in the morning.

784
01:02:39,725 --> 01:02:42,023
That's probably
how I'll end up.

785
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:44,756
Oh, jeez.

786
01:02:44,832 --> 01:02:47,027
You're pissed
out of your mind.

787
01:02:47,102 --> 01:02:48,034
Ooh.

788
01:02:48,103 --> 01:02:49,434
I'll take you home.

789
01:02:49,505 --> 01:02:50,563
All right.

790
01:03:27,791 --> 01:03:30,055
Why didn't you
do that inside?

791
01:03:30,127 --> 01:03:32,652
I did. It just goes
right through.

792
01:04:06,845 --> 01:04:08,710
Oh, my God!

793
01:04:13,487 --> 01:04:14,818
Jer.

794
01:04:16,257 --> 01:04:18,088
Help me.

795
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,752
Help me!

796
01:04:27,874 --> 01:04:29,171
Jesus.

797
01:04:30,411 --> 01:04:33,472
Maddox!
Maddox, open the door!

798
01:04:33,548 --> 01:04:36,848
Help! Maddox,
open the door!

799
01:04:36,919 --> 01:04:38,978
Please! Aah!

800
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:42,481
Please! Please don't!

801
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:47,123
Your life in exchange
for a promise.

802
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,326
You got it.

803
01:04:48,401 --> 01:04:50,392
If I let you go,

804
01:04:50,471 --> 01:04:53,566
you must swear you'll
never say you saw me.

805
01:04:53,642 --> 01:04:55,667
Never say
you heard me speak.

806
01:04:55,745 --> 01:04:57,770
Never tell anyone
how I look.

807
01:04:57,848 --> 01:05:00,647
Never repeat
what I've said.

808
01:05:00,718 --> 01:05:03,050
A promise forever.

809
01:05:03,122 --> 01:05:04,919
You got to be kidding.

810
01:05:06,393 --> 01:05:07,792
I... I... promise!

811
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:10,296
Cross your heart?

812
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:11,297
Ugh.

813
01:05:12,402 --> 01:05:14,097
I promise!

814
01:05:50,587 --> 01:05:51,519
Come here.

815
01:05:51,588 --> 01:05:52,850
No! Oh, God!

816
01:05:52,924 --> 01:05:56,224
Shh! Shut up.
Please be quiet.

817
01:05:56,295 --> 01:05:58,388
Please be quiet.
Shh.

818
01:05:58,465 --> 01:06:00,490
I'm not going
to hurt you.

819
01:06:00,568 --> 01:06:02,229
Just be quiet,
all right?

820
01:06:02,303 --> 01:06:05,330
All right?
I won't hurt you.

821
01:06:05,408 --> 01:06:07,308
Let go of me!

822
01:06:07,377 --> 01:06:09,402
What are you
trying to do?

823
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,573
Take a taxi.

824
01:06:11,649 --> 01:06:14,744
You don't see
any taxis out here, do you?

825
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:16,253
If you want one,

826
01:06:16,323 --> 01:06:19,054
you can use the phone
from my place.

827
01:06:22,498 --> 01:06:24,159
Look, my name
is Preston.

828
01:06:24,234 --> 01:06:26,965
I live just
around the corner.

829
01:06:29,641 --> 01:06:30,608
Come on.

830
01:06:35,049 --> 01:06:36,175
Come on.

831
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:49,734
I thought someone
was following me back there.

832
01:06:49,802 --> 01:06:50,826
That wasn't me.

833
01:06:52,238 --> 01:06:53,466
Here we are.

834
01:06:55,609 --> 01:06:57,634
What are you
doing down here?

835
01:06:57,712 --> 01:07:01,706
I was supposed to meet
some friends, but I got lost.

836
01:07:01,785 --> 01:07:03,218
Here you go.

837
01:07:15,671 --> 01:07:18,470
So what were you doing
out this late?

838
01:07:18,541 --> 01:07:21,534
I was having an argument.

839
01:07:21,612 --> 01:07:23,978
My agent dumped me
tonight.

840
01:07:41,573 --> 01:07:44,509
Police, 16th Precinct.
Hello?

841
01:07:44,577 --> 01:07:45,635
Uh...

842
01:07:47,715 --> 01:07:49,012
Anyone there?

843
01:07:51,019 --> 01:07:52,714
Jerk.

844
01:07:52,788 --> 01:07:54,221
The line's busy.

845
01:07:54,291 --> 01:07:57,090
We'll try again
in a minute.

846
01:07:58,596 --> 01:08:02,055
By the way...
what's your name?

847
01:08:02,135 --> 01:08:04,194
Carola.

848
01:08:05,406 --> 01:08:06,737
Carola.

849
01:08:08,544 --> 01:08:10,569
Can I have something
to drink?

850
01:08:11,648 --> 01:08:12,774
Sure.

851
01:08:21,228 --> 01:08:23,662
So where are you
from, anyway?

852
01:08:23,731 --> 01:08:25,528
Colorado.

853
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,692
Sort of.

854
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:29,568
I had a boyfriend
in California.

855
01:08:29,639 --> 01:08:33,269
But...
it didn't work out,

856
01:08:33,344 --> 01:08:35,312
so I left.

857
01:08:38,551 --> 01:08:41,544
You're the first real artist
I've ever met.

858
01:08:41,622 --> 01:08:43,249
Tell that to my agent.

859
01:08:47,831 --> 01:08:49,765
Did he do that?

860
01:08:55,642 --> 01:08:58,840
I had a run-in
with a bottle of scotch.

861
01:09:09,461 --> 01:09:10,621
I'm sorry.

862
01:09:10,695 --> 01:09:12,492
It's all right.

863
01:09:16,036 --> 01:09:17,094
I'm sorry.

864
01:09:18,172 --> 01:09:21,199
Say, did you try
that taxi again?

865
01:09:25,616 --> 01:09:27,481
Maybe you should
wait till morning.

866
01:10:35,713 --> 01:10:37,180
Good morning.

867
01:10:48,931 --> 01:10:52,368
Last night was
very important to me.

868
01:10:57,076 --> 01:10:58,304
It was a nightmare.

869
01:11:03,451 --> 01:11:04,884
Oh, no, Carola!

870
01:11:04,953 --> 01:11:06,386
Not you!

871
01:11:06,455 --> 01:11:09,289
It was everything else
until I ran into you.

872
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:10,883
That part was good.

873
01:11:10,961 --> 01:11:13,191
It was very good.

874
01:11:14,466 --> 01:11:16,263
I needed it.

875
01:11:16,335 --> 01:11:19,066
I need more of it.

876
01:11:19,139 --> 01:11:21,904
I do, too.
Right now.

877
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:26,914
Oh, yes.

878
01:11:33,325 --> 01:11:35,520
<i>Help me!</i>

879
01:11:40,435 --> 01:11:42,596
Oh, look.

880
01:11:42,672 --> 01:11:45,608
I have to go out
for a while.

881
01:11:57,291 --> 01:11:58,781
Wait for me.

882
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:23,186
Hey, that's
my friend!

883
01:12:23,261 --> 01:12:25,422
That's my friend!

884
01:12:25,497 --> 01:12:27,590
I want to go!

885
01:12:29,502 --> 01:12:32,529
Someone cut off
his head!

886
01:12:35,511 --> 01:12:36,603
Carola?

887
01:12:45,190 --> 01:12:46,452
Carola?

888
01:13:07,555 --> 01:13:10,286
Yeah. I would've
left, too.

889
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:17,833
<i>Help me!</i>

890
01:13:49,046 --> 01:13:50,308
Yeah.

891
01:13:50,381 --> 01:13:51,473
It's Carola.

892
01:13:51,549 --> 01:13:53,483
Can I come up?

893
01:13:54,554 --> 01:13:55,486
Sure.

894
01:14:05,736 --> 01:14:06,668
Jesus.

895
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:20,817
I know what
you're thinking,

896
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:23,655
but the girl I'm staying with,
her boyfriend...

897
01:14:23,727 --> 01:14:25,695
I didn't ask
any questions.

898
01:14:44,555 --> 01:14:47,491
I called
a friend of mine...

899
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,653
She's a friend
of a friend.

900
01:14:49,729 --> 01:14:52,027
She owns a gallery
on Houston Street.

901
01:14:52,099 --> 01:14:54,033
That's
House-ton Street.

902
01:14:54,102 --> 01:14:58,506
I told her how wonderful
I thought your work was,

903
01:14:58,575 --> 01:15:01,511
so she'd like
to come see it.

904
01:15:01,579 --> 01:15:03,672
Does she
have a name?

905
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:06,514
Victorine...

906
01:15:06,586 --> 01:15:09,020
but I don't remember
the rest.

907
01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:11,024
Roget?

908
01:15:11,092 --> 01:15:13,526
Victorine Roget?

909
01:15:15,098 --> 01:15:17,032
A friend
of a friend?

910
01:15:18,602 --> 01:15:20,695
Jesus.

911
01:15:20,772 --> 01:15:22,865
I hope you don't mind.

912
01:15:22,942 --> 01:15:26,208
Victorine Roget...

913
01:15:26,279 --> 01:15:29,215
owns the hottest
gallery downtown.

914
01:15:30,786 --> 01:15:33,152
Of course
I don't mind!

915
01:15:33,223 --> 01:15:35,453
It's what
I've always wanted.

916
01:15:48,243 --> 01:15:52,044
So how does it feel
to be a huge success?

917
01:15:52,115 --> 01:15:56,849
Victorine just sold
a piece to a couple for $23,000.

918
01:15:56,922 --> 01:15:58,685
You're a smash.

919
01:16:03,764 --> 01:16:05,698
Well?

920
01:16:07,103 --> 01:16:08,365
Damn.

921
01:16:09,606 --> 01:16:10,573
What?

922
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:14,870
Preston.

923
01:16:16,615 --> 01:16:17,877
Excuse me.

924
01:16:20,388 --> 01:16:21,878
Hey, Maddox.

925
01:16:21,956 --> 01:16:23,116
Nice work.

926
01:16:23,192 --> 01:16:24,124
Thanks.

927
01:16:24,193 --> 01:16:26,787
I haven't seen you
around, pal.

928
01:16:28,365 --> 01:16:30,765
Not since
the night Jer died.

929
01:16:30,835 --> 01:16:31,699
I'm Carola.

930
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:35,298
Nice
to meet you.

931
01:16:35,374 --> 01:16:36,398
Who's Jer?

932
01:16:36,476 --> 01:16:38,671
The bartender
at this bar...

933
01:16:38,746 --> 01:16:40,737
He died.

934
01:16:40,815 --> 01:16:42,840
In the alley
out back.

935
01:16:42,918 --> 01:16:45,512
Come on. Let's go.

936
01:16:45,589 --> 01:16:48,183
Hey, you know
something, don't you?

937
01:16:48,259 --> 01:16:49,692
Just sober up, Maddox,

938
01:16:49,761 --> 01:16:52,355
before someone puts
a match to your breath.

939
01:16:52,432 --> 01:16:53,524
Preston.

940
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,536
I told the cops
everything I knew,

941
01:16:56,604 --> 01:16:58,037
which is
exactly nothing.

942
01:16:58,106 --> 01:16:59,698
Come on.

943
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:20,735
<i>Promise forever.</i>

944
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:28,747
So are you sorry
you met me?

945
01:17:28,814 --> 01:17:30,748
You take care of me.

946
01:17:30,817 --> 01:17:32,682
Maybe just
a little bit...

947
01:17:33,755 --> 01:17:35,689
I take care of you.

948
01:17:35,758 --> 01:17:40,196
Will you take care
of me... and my child?

949
01:17:42,267 --> 01:17:44,235
Your child?

950
01:17:46,773 --> 01:17:48,934
Oh, so...

951
01:17:51,279 --> 01:17:54,772
We going to make
this little bastard legitimate?

952
01:17:54,850 --> 01:17:56,977
To put it
another way...

953
01:17:58,790 --> 01:18:00,417
will you marry me?

954
01:18:11,808 --> 01:18:14,242
Will you marry me
like this?

955
01:18:16,313 --> 01:18:18,247
Oh, ho ho!
Yes, baby!

956
01:18:18,316 --> 01:18:19,408
No! I'm pregnant!

957
01:18:19,485 --> 01:18:21,214
Come here,
sweetie!

958
01:18:21,287 --> 01:18:22,754
No, no, please!

959
01:19:14,827 --> 01:19:17,592
Where are
the scissors... scissors?

960
01:19:35,789 --> 01:19:38,725
Mom, look what Wyatt
bought for me!

961
01:19:38,793 --> 01:19:42,525
They took our picture
a million times.

962
01:19:42,599 --> 01:19:44,533
These kids
ran me ragged.

963
01:19:44,602 --> 01:19:47,401
Each has the metabolism
of a hummingbird.

964
01:19:47,473 --> 01:19:52,571
Ooh, is there some party
tonight that I'm missing?

965
01:19:52,646 --> 01:19:55,080
Yes. Preston and I
are celebrating

966
01:19:55,150 --> 01:19:58,587
the 10th anniversary of
the night we first met.

967
01:19:58,654 --> 01:20:01,590
When you thought he was
going to rape you?

968
01:20:01,658 --> 01:20:04,092
Yes, darling.
It's also the night

969
01:20:04,162 --> 01:20:07,132
that Wyatt here gave
your father the shaft.

970
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:09,258
I had to murder
three other agents

971
01:20:09,336 --> 01:20:11,770
before you'd let me
represent him again.

972
01:20:11,839 --> 01:20:13,272
And you're still
on probation,

973
01:20:13,342 --> 01:20:14,775
you mercenary wretch.

974
01:20:14,843 --> 01:20:16,777
Find another agent
that'll baby-sit

975
01:20:16,846 --> 01:20:19,782
the spawn of hell
on a Saturday night.

976
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:20,817
Wyatt!

977
01:20:25,358 --> 01:20:27,292
Choose your weapon.

978
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:54,922
10 years.

979
01:20:56,834 --> 01:20:58,768
So many things
have changed.

980
01:20:58,837 --> 01:21:00,930
Changed for
the better, I hope.

981
01:21:02,842 --> 01:21:06,108
The night I met you,
I almost died.

982
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:07,613
What do you mean?

983
01:21:09,352 --> 01:21:10,785
Well, let's just say

984
01:21:10,853 --> 01:21:13,880
it was the night
my life started over again.

985
01:21:45,134 --> 01:21:46,431
So, happy anniversary.

986
01:21:51,343 --> 01:21:53,436
You know,
you saved Preston

987
01:21:53,512 --> 01:21:55,002
from people like me.

988
01:21:56,349 --> 01:21:58,283
She saved me
from myself.

989
01:21:58,352 --> 01:21:59,751
Time to go.

990
01:21:59,821 --> 01:22:02,655
Sincerity is bad
for my self-image.

991
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:05,793
Good night, Wyatt.

992
01:22:05,863 --> 01:22:07,296
Good night,
Wyatt.

993
01:22:12,371 --> 01:22:14,305
Whoa, taxi!

994
01:22:14,374 --> 01:22:15,966
Taxi!

995
01:22:21,885 --> 01:22:23,819
Let's move
to the country.

996
01:22:23,888 --> 01:22:25,822
We'll buy
a big house

997
01:22:25,891 --> 01:22:28,485
with lots of land
for the kids.

998
01:22:28,561 --> 01:22:31,326
They'd hate it
as much as you would.

999
01:22:31,398 --> 01:22:32,831
Then for you.

1000
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:35,334
There's nothing
you could give me

1001
01:22:35,403 --> 01:22:36,836
that I don't
already have.

1002
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:41,935
Yes, there is.

1003
01:22:42,013 --> 01:22:44,504
Oh, Christ,
I hate this neighborhood.

1004
01:22:44,583 --> 01:22:47,017
Can't get
a cab here ever.

1005
01:23:02,574 --> 01:23:05,271
No one has
ever seen this.

1006
01:23:30,312 --> 01:23:32,303
That's what killed Jer.

1007
01:23:33,917 --> 01:23:35,851
Then it turned on me.

1008
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:38,252
I knew
I was going to die,

1009
01:23:38,323 --> 01:23:40,518
but it spoke. It spoke.

1010
01:23:40,593 --> 01:23:43,529
It told me
it wouldn't kill me

1011
01:23:43,597 --> 01:23:47,034
if I promised never
to tell anybody what I'd seen.

1012
01:23:47,102 --> 01:23:49,036
So I never told anybody.

1013
01:23:50,641 --> 01:23:53,075
Then why are you
telling me?

1014
01:23:53,143 --> 01:23:55,077
Because you're the most
important thing

1015
01:23:55,146 --> 01:23:56,579
in my life.

1016
01:23:56,649 --> 01:23:59,083
You've brought me
10 years of happiness,

1017
01:23:59,152 --> 01:24:00,585
10 years of success,

1018
01:24:00,654 --> 01:24:02,884
10 years
of a perfect life.

1019
01:24:02,957 --> 01:24:05,551
I'm telling you
because I love you.

1020
01:24:07,297 --> 01:24:10,267
You deserve everything
I can give you,

1021
01:24:10,334 --> 01:24:13,270
and I've never
given you the truth

1022
01:24:13,338 --> 01:24:16,740
about what happened
the night we met.

1023
01:24:46,951 --> 01:24:47,883
What's wrong?

1024
01:24:47,952 --> 01:24:49,886
I'm not
making this up.

1025
01:24:49,955 --> 01:24:51,582
I'm telling you
the truth.

1026
01:24:54,462 --> 01:24:58,297
You promised
you'd never tell!

1027
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:01,402
Ohh!

1028
01:25:20,597 --> 01:25:22,030
Oh, God.

1029
01:25:22,099 --> 01:25:24,465
You broke your promise,
you idiot!

1030
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:26,265
I loved you!

1031
01:25:26,339 --> 01:25:27,601
Ugh!

1032
01:25:30,511 --> 01:25:32,274
Jesus, please...

1033
01:25:36,052 --> 01:25:38,486
Carola, stop it!
Just change back.

1034
01:25:38,555 --> 01:25:40,216
I can't.

1035
01:25:56,380 --> 01:25:57,506
No.

1036
01:25:57,581 --> 01:25:58,513
No!

1037
01:26:01,587 --> 01:26:04,284
What's wrong with the kids?
Stop it!

1038
01:26:04,358 --> 01:26:05,791
It's too late.

1039
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:09,422
You betrayed
your vow.

1040
01:26:12,369 --> 01:26:14,098
It can't be!

1041
01:26:17,008 --> 01:26:19,135
No!

1042
01:26:23,016 --> 01:26:25,143
I'm so sorry.

1043
01:26:35,801 --> 01:26:37,393
Carola...

1044
01:26:37,469 --> 01:26:39,835
I loved you.

1045
01:26:39,906 --> 01:26:41,771
And I loved you, too,

1046
01:26:41,842 --> 01:26:43,434
but you broke
your vow,

1047
01:26:43,512 --> 01:26:45,912
and that sealed
our destiny.

1048
01:27:12,518 --> 01:27:13,450
Yo!

1049
01:27:21,030 --> 01:27:24,467
Raarrr!

1050
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:30,474
What the hell
was that?

1051
01:27:30,543 --> 01:27:32,408
I don't want to know.

1052
01:28:05,525 --> 01:28:10,486
My goodness, you really did keep
the best one for last.

1053
01:28:10,565 --> 01:28:14,400
No. I saved the really,
really best one for now.

1054
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:15,903
You should have told me

1055
01:28:15,972 --> 01:28:17,963
the really, really
best story before,

1056
01:28:18,041 --> 01:28:20,271
'cause now
it's too late.

1057
01:28:21,813 --> 01:28:25,375
It's the best one because
there's a happy ending,

1058
01:28:25,451 --> 01:28:27,442
a really happy ending.

1059
01:28:27,521 --> 01:28:30,389
The stories in that book
don't have happy endings.

1060
01:28:30,458 --> 01:28:32,926
But you got to
hear this story.

1061
01:28:32,995 --> 01:28:34,428
This kid,
his name's Timmy...

1062
01:28:34,498 --> 01:28:35,931
That's nice, dear.

1063
01:28:35,999 --> 01:28:39,128
And Timmy's older brother
had this paper route.

1064
01:28:39,203 --> 01:28:41,831
One day, when
Timmy's brother got sick,

1065
01:28:41,907 --> 01:28:43,841
Timmy had to go collecting.

1066
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:46,401
Timmy went
to this one house,

1067
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:49,108
and this lady at the door
said, "Come in."

1068
01:28:49,184 --> 01:28:52,951
He went inside, and she
threw him into a pantry.

1069
01:28:53,023 --> 01:28:55,822
She made him eat cookies
to get fat

1070
01:28:55,894 --> 01:28:59,456
'cause she was going to
kill him and eat him!

1071
01:28:59,532 --> 01:29:00,965
This is your story,

1072
01:29:01,034 --> 01:29:04,129
and we both know
how it comes out.

1073
01:29:04,205 --> 01:29:06,970
But you don't. Something
really weird happens.

1074
01:29:07,042 --> 01:29:08,634
Oh, really?

1075
01:29:08,712 --> 01:29:11,807
Yeah. Uh, Timmy
had these marbles

1076
01:29:11,882 --> 01:29:13,315
in his pocket,

1077
01:29:13,384 --> 01:29:15,477
and they were
all shiny and slippery.

1078
01:29:15,554 --> 01:29:17,385
When he threw them
on the floor...

1079
01:29:17,457 --> 01:29:20,291
she didn't see
where they went...

1080
01:29:20,361 --> 01:29:21,623
and she slipped!

1081
01:29:26,268 --> 01:29:28,133
Timmy saw his chance
to escape...

1082
01:29:30,108 --> 01:29:33,909
if he could just
reach the keys!

1083
01:30:01,551 --> 01:30:04,042
Don't you just love
happy endings?
