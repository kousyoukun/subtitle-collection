out of the Penrose.
既使被搞掉了奖学金  也无所谓的

140

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,120

那你有偷吗

149

I loathe Zuni aesthetics.

I should probably

buy something like this?
艾德华  你怎会买下这种东西?

163
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:24,110
I wasn't born with a silver
trust fund in my mouth.
因为我不是
天生含着金汤匙出生的

164
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,420
You... You can actually
sell this to somebody...

卖得掉吗

165
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,920

What else
would I sell it for?

it looks just like
your father.

It stinks like rotten flowers.
味道很像腐烂的植物

173

We quit after two sets.

186
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,830
Sounds like we lost
to Andy again.
听起来好像又输给安迪了

187
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,840

Well, that's okay.

Andy knows it was you.

for what Lee and Susan
did to you.

because what sane person
我也不会报警
因为没有疯子会相信

401
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:03,830
would believe that
a 3,000-year-old mummy
是那个三千年前的木乃伊干的

402
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,990
really did come
back to life anyway?
复活过来杀人?

403
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,470
But I do have another idea.

You don't need
the scroll.
你又不需要那东西

409
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,900
It only worked
for that mummy,

410
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,700
which you've
totally destroyed.
那个已经被你毁掉的木乃伊

my entire career.

died because of this.
我妹跟我朋友为了它而死

bring them back.
既使杀了我 也无法挽回啊

If I let you live,
that will bring them back?

418
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,610
Don't worry, Andy.

Bind them both
to my service
