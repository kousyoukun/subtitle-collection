1
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:12,950
There he is.

2
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,580
There's the stallion. That's War Winds.

3
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,160
Beautiful.

4
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,790
That's my daughter riding him. Leslie.

5
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,220
Leslie is my daughter. She's riding him.

6
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,010
Doctor, that sure is a beautiful animal.

7
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,890
We'll get to the horses
first thing in the morning.

8
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,190
Now you'll come up to the house
and get ready for dinner.

9
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,040
So you are from Nevada, Mr. Beckwith?

10
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,550
Texas, Mama.

11
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,510
You're from Texas, Mr. Beckwith?

12
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,470
Yes, ma'am, Texas. Benedict's the name.

13
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,970
You're here about the horses, aren't you?

14
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,060
Yes, ma'am.

15
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,350
I came to buy your stallion, War Winds,
that is if your daughter doesn't mind too much.

16
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,650
In all likelihood,
our Leslie will be leaving us soon in any case.

17
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,530
David is with the embassy in Washington.
He's been called back to England.

18
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,370
Will she like it there, do you think?

19
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,250
She's going to marry him?

20
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,380
Mother! Let me sell Mr. Benedict
War Winds.

21
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,340
I can tell you all his bad points.

22
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,590
For one thing, he eats too much,
doesn't he, Papa?

23
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,930
'Cause you see, it's either War Winds or me.
Something has to go.

24
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,430
Now Leslie you know very well that horse is
just too spirited for any woman to ride.

25
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:08,480
I know Miss Leslie that your horse is gonna miss you
and all this nice, green country, but...

26
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,400
I'll do my best to make him feel
right at home in Texas.

27
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,740
Isn't Texas green, Mr. Benedict?

28
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,490
Well, no ma'am, not altogether.

29
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,700
You must tell us about Texas,
Mr. Benedict.

30
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,700
Well, it's not that easy.

31
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,420
It's different than any other state, I think.

32
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,960
At least that's what we think.
It's almost a different country.

33
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,300
From an Englishman's point of view,
its mere size takes your breath away.

34
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,470
Yes, it's big all right.

35
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,600
How large are your ranches?

36
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,940
Most every size. Large and small.

37
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,980
Mr. Benedict's Reata is
one of the largest of them all.

38
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,520
Oh, really?

39
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,860
And just how large is that?

40
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,070
It's one of the biggest.

41
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,120
How big is that?

42
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,000
There are one or two others as big,
I suppose, up where we come from...

43
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,790
and some larger ones
on the coastal plains.

44
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,510
Can't you be more specific?

45
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:18,630
What's the size of your place?
50,000? 20,000 acres?

46
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,850
Around a half million.
595,000 acres, to be exact.

47
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,690
I'd call that quite a parcel!

48
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,400
How many acres did you say,
Mr. Benedict?

49
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,150
He said 595,000 acres, Mama.

50
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,820
And you should see the greedy look
on your face.

51
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,910
Witness excused.

52
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,750
Won't you join us at the Hunt Ball?
I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

53
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,170
No, thank you, Miss Leslie.

54
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,840
I'm afraid I wouldn't look good
in this outfit.

55
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,860
I like your country.

56
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,900
Why don't you stay a while
and really see something of it?

57
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,200
It's roundup time in my country.
Big spring roundup.

58
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,370
Your country?

59
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,160
Reata.

60
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:35,250
Your country, my country.
You make us sound so far apart.

61
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,470
Maybe you could come out and see it...

62
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,060
if you get a chance.

63
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,420
I'll be off real early in the morning, so...

64
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
goodbye.

65
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,630
I'm awfully glad you came.

66
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,590
I'm not going to say goodbye to you
in the moonlight.

67
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,680
It would just be too touching. Good night!

68
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,220
" Texas."

69
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,270
Are you in love with him?

70
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,140
Yes, I think so.

71
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,400
Will you do me a favor
and run along to bed?

72
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,660
-Leslie?
-Good night.

73
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,630
If you won't marry David Karfrey...

74
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,550
will you give him to me?

75
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,380
Yes! Now, good night.

76
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,370
As far as I'm concerned, it's a deal.

77
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,460
-$10,000 is a lot of money.
-It's a lot of horse.

78
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,470
Let's have some breakfast and get going.

79
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,610
-Why, Leslie!
-Good morning.

80
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,170
You don't look as if you'd been dancing
all night, Miss Leslie.

81
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,790
I came home at 10:55.

82
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,880
I read about Texas until 5:00 this morning.

83
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,670
Let the poor boy
eat his breakfast in peace.

84
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,600
It takes a heap of reading, Texas does.

85
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,560
We really stole Texas, didn't we?

86
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,270
I mean, away from Mexico.

87
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,730
You're catching me a bit early
to start joking.

88
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:12,860
But I'm not joking.
It's all right there in the history books.

89
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:17,080
Mr. Austin came down
with 300 families, it says.

90
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,500
The next thing you know,
they're claiming it from Mexico.

91
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,880
I never heard anything as ignorant
as some Eastern people--

92
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,880
Oh, please, Jordan.

93
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,090
I'm only speaking impersonally.
About history.

94
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,180
You all think
that the glory happened in the East...

95
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,510
with Valley Forge and Bunker Hill!

96
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:43,060
Do you know about San Jacinto?
Have you heard about the Alamo?

97
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,850
Why, certainly.

98
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,360
I read about them all last night.

99
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,320
I didn't mean to be impolite,
but it's so new to me.

100
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,700
I just mean, it's just all so new...

101
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,040
and so fascinating!

102
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:05,080
You mustn't talk that way to a Texan.
They feel very strongly about their state.

103
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,500
He shouldn't take it so hard.

104
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:13,130
Jordan, you would think
somebody had spoiled you terribly.

105
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,300
Your wife or somebody.

106
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,810
I haven't any wife. I live with my sister.

107
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,820
Why aren't you married?

108
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,410
First you attack a man's country,
and now you try to pry into his family life.

109
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,240
Thank you, Doctor.

110
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,910
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

111
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,620
-Good morning, Lacey.
-Good morning, Papa.

112
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,340
How are we doing?

113
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,260
We'll have to be getting along soon
if you're going to make your train.

114
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,970
-Good morning, everybody.
-Good morning, Nancy.

115
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,680
Good morning, dear.

116
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,470
Good morning, Mr. Benedict.

117
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,020
Isn't this a beautiful morning?

118
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,700
Leslie, if Mr. Benedict has finished
his breakfast...

119
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,080
why don't you show him the stables?

120
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:28,040
We've just quarreled politely about Texas.
It's no use trying to pawn me off on him.

121
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,710
And anyway, Mother...

122
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,970
he's probably engaged to marry
the daughter of the adjoining ranch...

123
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:40,340
who, though beautiful,
is comparatively poor.

124
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,010
She only has 200,000 acres
and half a million cows.

125
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,440
Is she pretty?

126
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,980
We must hurry.

127
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,200
Mr. Benedict and I will have
to be leaving now.

128
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,840
Who, may I ask, is the lucky young lady
that you're going to marry...

129
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,050
with all those cows?

130
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,970
I'll get the car.

131
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:33,020
It's funny, ma'am.
My neighbor is a girl, Vashti Hake.

132
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,200
There was some talk of my marrying her,
but I'm not.

133
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,830
Come on, if you want to catch that train.

134
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,210
It all sounds so romantic!

135
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,290
Come along, David, you're for me.

136
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,350
What's that, a wolf?.

137
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,100
No, honey.

138
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,980
It's just a little old coyote.

139
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,410
Don't you think you've done
enough sightseeing?

140
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,240
Tell me when we're in Texas.

141
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,040
That's Texas you've been looking at.

142
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,870
For the last eight hours.

143
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:03,130
I don't know how other brides feel
on their honeymoon...

144
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,510
but I'm having a lovely time.

145
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,180
We can't say it's been dull.

146
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,520
That is, so far anyway.

147
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,330
Wake up, honey. We're here, honey.

148
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Where?

149
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,550
Hello.

150
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,130
Good morning.

151
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,390
Is that Texas?

152
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,020
It's Benedict. That's where we ship from.

153
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,730
These people never learn!

154
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,900
I'm Mrs. Benedict.

155
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,830
That means, " Welcome, the newlyweds."

156
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,210
Let's go, Leslie.

157
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,630
And what is your name?

158
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,960
That's a beautiful name.

159
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,510
Come on, it's 50 miles to coffee.

160
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,900
This is it, honey. This is your home.

161
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:16,030
But it's huge!

162
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,290
I thought it was a ranch house.

163
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:24,080
My old man built it to show the cotton
crowd we were just as high-powered.

164
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,170
It's enormous just for the two of us.

165
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,880
Luz lives here with me.

166
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,420
With us.

167
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,220
She's run the house since Ma passed on.
Some say she even runs the ranch!

168
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,230
Take it easy, Leslie.

169
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,810
What are your names?

170
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,960
What do you mean behave?

171
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:11,590
Here we don't make a fuss
over those people. You're a Texan now.

172
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,180
Is that a state of mind? I'm still myself.

173
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,100
You're my wife, honey. You're a Benedict.

174
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:28,310
I still have a mind of my own.
Elsewhere, being gracious is acceptable.

175
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,730
We're gracious, but....

176
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,620
Fine thing...

177
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,830
standing here quarreling
with rice still in our hair!

178
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,490
It's so nice and cool!

179
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,210
I thought somebody was hurt, maybe.

180
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,380
We didn't know you were there.

181
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:36,210
Well, we're home. We're here.

182
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,720
I've been looking for you for weeks.

183
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,840
We weren't expected to be back sooner,
were we?

184
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:45,310
With all the spring work to be done,
the roundup...

185
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,350
I didn't figure Bick would stay away.

186
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:55,110
If I miss a roundup every time I have
a honeymoon, I won't miss much, will I?

187
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,410
I thought I fired him off this place.

188
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:15,130
Where do you think you're going
with my automobile?

189
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,170
Just hold on.

190
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,550
Don't go taking off on me.
That old truck broke down again.

191
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,430
You want me going down the road?

192
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,060
That's exactly what I was going to do.

193
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,270
But she said,
"You stay on and do your work."

194
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,400
Next time I tell you to get, you get!

195
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:41,700
Bick and Jett are everlasting jangling
about something.

196
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,080
<i>-Madama is the one who told me to stay.
-That's right.</i>

197
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,870
With you away,
we needed all the help there was.

198
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:53,460
They're all scared to death of her.
You know that.

199
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,250
Everyone, except you and me.

200
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,840
You just tend to your work.

201
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,880
Tell me who is the boss around here...

202
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,430
and I'll be glad to do anything you want.
Just tell me who's the boss.

203
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,930
This is Bick's new wife.

204
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,270
Leslie, this boy here is Jett Rink.

205
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,650
-Hello.
-He works for us.

206
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:29,450
You'd better get going, Jett,
and get that truck fixed.

207
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,880
Nobody is king in this country.

208
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,300
Nobody, no matter what they think.

209
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:50,640
<i>I'm sorry, honey. Things go loco here
every time I'm away.</i>

210
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,940
Remember the time of the big rodeo?

211
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,070
Old Kale Beebe blew in,
higher than a kite...

212
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,070
slept on the sofa in your office.

213
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:10,030
He must have had nightmares.
He cut the couch to ribbons with his spurs.

214
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,160
This here is Bick's room.

215
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,540
This down here is your room, honey.

216
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
Look....

217
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,670
We're married.

218
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,050
You know how that is.

219
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,770
We'll take the connecting rooms.

220
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:37,270
We'll make that into a sitting room
where we can sit and talk...

221
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,190
and the breeze can get at us.

222
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:34,120
Breakfast's ready.

223
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,580
You and Jordan
have had breakfast already?

224
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,670
We have our coffee and talk
every morning of our lives at 5:00.

225
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,170
Try and get things rounded up for the day.

226
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,680
I thought I was going riding with him
to the roundup.

227
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,640
It would've been too hot for you.
I told him so.

228
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,770
Bring it in here.

229
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,600
You gotta watch out for that sun.
It's rough.

230
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,980
Sit down.

231
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,400
Your blood's too thin. That's the trouble
with a lot of Easterners.

232
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,330
Thank you.

233
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,580
I'm fine, Luz.

234
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:22,170
I'm a lot tougher perhaps
than you think I am.

235
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:27,210
Me...

236
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:32,550
I never had a sick day in my life.
Except when I got thrown and tromped on.

237
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,930
All you gotta do is take it easy.

238
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:39,390
This rich Texas air will fix you up.

239
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,190
Don't you worry none
about being lonesome.

240
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,980
I'll round up the neighbors.

241
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,030
You're going to meet some folks.

242
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:52,990
Yes, indeed.
You're going to meet some folks.

243
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,740
This is Mr. and Mrs. Bale Clinch.

244
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,160
Bick, it's about time. Howdy, ma'am.

245
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,750
I'd like you to meet
my little wife, Adarene.

246
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,340
I'm mighty pleased to meet you.

247
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,840
This is Judge Whiteside.

248
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,130
How do you do, Mrs. Benedict?
We sure are proud to have you here.

249
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,220
Bick, congratulations.
Mighty happy for you, boy.

250
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,810
She sure is pretty.

251
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,180
I think so.

252
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,350
Here's Ula Japes.

253
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,190
Glad to meet you, ma'am.

254
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,810
Good to see you, Bick.

255
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,730
This is Ms. Wharton.

256
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,980
Howdy, Leslie. Mighty happy to meet you.

257
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,240
Fernie Kling.

258
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,860
We're glad to have you with us.

259
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,530
You've really done well for yourself.

260
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,780
Thank you, Fernie.

261
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,380
Now you'll meet the neighbor
I told you about.

262
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,090
The one who lives 50 miles away
with all those cows?

263
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,430
Vashti, I'd like you to meet my wife.

264
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,140
Hello, Vashti. So nice to meet you.

265
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,350
Jordan told me so much about you.

266
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,690
Mighty glad to know you.

267
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,110
I'm awfully glad we're neighbors.

268
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,980
I hope we'll be real close friends.

269
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,460
My name is Mort Snythe.
They call me Pinky.

270
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,340
Come here.

271
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,170
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-We'll be seeing you.

272
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,050
-This will perk you up, Miss Leslie.
-Thank you.

273
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:23,350
I propose a toast to a daughter
of old Maryland...

274
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:27,980
now blooming into a citizen
of the Lone Star State. To the bride!

275
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:37,700
Are you all right?

276
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,360
I'm fine, don't worry.

277
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:43,530
-There's more than one bride here today.
-How's that, Vashti?

278
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:48,040
Mort Snythe and I were married yesterday
in Hermosa.

279
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,970
I'm gonna kiss him!

280
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,810
I guess that leaves only me.

281
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:11,980
Why, Luz, everybody in the county knows
you'd rather herd cattle than make love!

282
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,570
One thing you gotta say for cattle:

283
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:18,240
You put your brand on one of them,
you know where it's at!

284
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,030
Come and get it!

285
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,390
The best food you ever ate, honey.

286
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,850
<i>This is real Mexican barbacoa.</i>

287
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,560
That's where we get the word " barbecue."

288
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,240
What is that?

289
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,740
Calf's head.

290
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:10,790
We take it and wrap it in clean white cloth
and then wrap it tight in canvas...

291
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:14,750
and put it down in a pit
of hot mesquite coals for 18 hours.

292
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,250
And do those brains taste sweet!

293
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,090
How fascinating!

294
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,930
I don't think I'm really terribly hungry.
It must be the heat.

295
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,850
You call this hot?

296
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,350
Wait till July!

297
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,520
Eat it while it's hot!

298
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,110
What's the matter with her, Bick?

299
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,650
That's what I was afraid of!

300
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,710
Leslie?

301
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,310
Good morning, Luz.

302
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,100
What are you doing up?

303
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,690
Getting breakfast.

304
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,490
I think there's something
we should get in the clear.

305
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:33,120
I don't want to take your place.
I want you to know that.

306
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,580
But I can't have you
taking my place either.

307
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:40,340
I can't be just a guest
in my husband's house.

308
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,800
There you are.

309
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,260
Good morning, darling.

310
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,050
-How are you feeling?
-Fine.

311
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,140
You look fine.

312
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:57,020
I want everybody to know, no matter
what happens around here in the future...

313
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,610
I am never going to faint again.

314
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,780
I'll never get the hang of you,
Mrs. Benedict.

315
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,840
A horse that cost you a lot
for breeding stock, I'd use it for breeding.

316
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:33,140
I wouldn't let anyone ride him.
I wouldn't care if she's your wife.

317
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:38,100
I'd see she rides a more gentle animal
if I were you.

318
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,980
She's going to fall off and break her neck.

319
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:01,880
<i>That's Old Polo. He's head vaquero.</i>

320
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,880
He's been here longer than any of us.

321
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,630
Since Grandpa Benedict's time.

322
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,730
Look at them, honey!

323
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:26,690
There's never been anything like them
in this world, I can tell you.

324
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,070
Did you ever see such stock?

325
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,610
Are they all ours?

326
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,870
These and 59,000 others just like them.

327
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,080
Granddaddy and his boys
used to drive his longhorns...

328
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:44,130
great herds of them,
all the way to Kansas.

329
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,720
He was a pretty good old boy.
I mean, he was tough, too.

330
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,600
My old man brought in stock from Europe
and bred them in the best ways.

331
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,640
Look out!

332
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:05,900
This right here is the result, honey.

333
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,940
Look at them.

334
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,710
How are you doing?

335
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,920
Tired, honey?

336
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,210
Don't you worry about me.

337
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,510
I'm a tough Texan now.

338
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,850
You know, I love you, Tex.

339
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:39,910
Howdy, everybody.

340
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:47,750
Hold on a minute. I want you
to take Mrs. Benedict back in with you.

341
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,050
Go with Jett, and get out of this heat.

342
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,590
Honey, I'm fine, really.

343
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:55,420
There's no use overdoing it.
Go along with Jett.

344
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,400
Good morning, Jett.

345
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,030
Take it easy, Jett.

346
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,620
I don't want to chew on this, Bick...

347
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,870
but I think we'd better get it straight.

348
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,210
I run the house, don't I?

349
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:32,420
Her house. Her kitchen. Her help.

350
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,760
She doesn't even speak Spanish.

351
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,010
They understand English
when they want to.

352
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:40,300
I know how to handle Mexicans.
I've done it all my life.

353
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,600
They'd sit on their honkers all day
if I didn't keep after them.

354
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,310
All right, Luz. Cool off.

355
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,570
I thought we ought to talk
without her around.

356
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:58,900
I don't want to feel that you're setting up
against me, Bick.

357
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,120
Nobody is setting up against you, Luz.

358
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,080
That gal's my wife.

359
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:13,840
And you're fair enough, I think,
to try and get along with her.

360
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,260
All right.

361
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,970
I'll get a horse and help push
the stock along.

362
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,510
Maybe it'll make me feel better.

363
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,890
You gotta push something.

364
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,980
When I get enough, I'll ride on in.

365
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,530
Why did you come to Texas?

366
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:42,280
I mean, everybody else's trying
to get away from here.

367
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,490
Me, I'll get out of here one of these days.

368
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,540
This is my husband's land.

369
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,120
This is his home.

370
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:00,720
Who gets hold of this much land
unless they took it off somebody else?

371
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:05,390
You're not exactly loyal
to your employer, Jett.

372
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,890
No, I'm not complaining.

373
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,140
They bought this land long ago.

374
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:12,980
The Benedicts.

375
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:18,030
-They got it though purchase, years ago.
-Took it from some ignorant Mexicans.

376
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:22,280
That's not true. They bought and traded
for Spanish land grants.

377
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,540
They paid for it all right.
They paid five cents an acre.

378
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:31,910
I know my folks were here long enough
to get rich, too.

379
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,500
Except they just weren't so foxy.

380
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:24,130
Keep it on, boy. I'll ride him.

381
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,300
<i>Nobody rides him but the señora.</i>

382
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:30,760
I've been riding what I want to
for 30 years.

383
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:32,930
Already he bucked off Lopez.

384
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,150
If he bucks me down,
he won't be the first one that's done it.

385
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,860
I suppose you came out here
to show me how to run things, too.

386
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,030
Let's go.

387
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,960
I'm not too awful bad now.

388
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:07,800
<i>I've got a few friends.
And Madama likes me.</i>

389
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:13,470
And Bick....
Now, even old Bick likes me a little bit.

390
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,230
Of course,
they don't like me quite enough to...

391
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:24,150
kind of divvy up
what they got way too much of.

392
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:32,830
You're an odd one, aren't you, Jett?
But I like you.

393
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:42,800
I like you, too.

394
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:48,970
You're the best-looking gal
we've seen around here in a long time.

395
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:55,930
The prettiest one
I think I've seen down here.

396
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,060
Thank you, Jett.

397
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,600
That's a very nice compliment.

398
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:04,400
I'll tell my husband of that,
with your approval.

399
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,660
No, I wouldn't do that.

400
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,620
No, I wouldn't do that.

401
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,240
Beautiful Reata!

402
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,330
Them's your neighbors live there.

403
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,500
Them kids there.
Them's your ranch people.

404
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:05,920
Those are Angel Obregon's kids.

405
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,710
That's the man who met us at the train.

406
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,010
Sure in good shape, ain't they?
Whole bunch of them sick.

407
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,760
What's the matter with them?

408
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:18,640
I don't know. Just sick. Every one of them.

409
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,190
Wait a minute. I want to get out here.

410
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:25,440
I wouldn't do that if I was you.

411
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:27,400
Wait.

412
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:33,740
You're the boss.
And you know it, don't you?

413
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,540
May I come in?

414
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:47,380
I'm Mrs. Benedict.

415
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,090
<i>Perdoname...</i>

416
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:52,840
that I do not rise.

417
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,970
The baby is sick.

418
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:00,430
My milk is not good.

419
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:29,520
Have you seen a doctor?

420
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:34,030
Doctor? It is too far to come.

421
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:41,080
Mrs. Leslie,
I think we'd better be getting on.

422
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:45,660
This baby is extremely ill.

423
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,540
You're not supposed to be in there.

424
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:53,840
Try not to worry, Mrs. Obregon.
I'll be back soon.

425
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,880
Bick's going to blow a gasket.

426
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:13,900
What is it?

427
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,570
What's happened to him?

428
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,030
What's wrong?

429
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:39,050
Where in the world have you been?
I've been looking for you, too.

430
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:42,090
What happened to her?

431
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,010
I stopped by the village.

432
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:47,270
What happened?

433
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:48,810
It's just awful.

434
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,810
I don't know. She was riding War Winds.

435
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,320
She might have been thrown
or something.

436
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,370
What does the doctor say?

437
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:08,370
It's bad.

438
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,290
She hit her head on a mesquite stump.

439
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,140
She's been riding since she was six.

440
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,770
She could ride anything.
And now this happens.

441
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,130
How is she?

442
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:58,130
She's in a state of shock. Very serious.

443
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:00,800
Concussion, possible hemorrhaging.

444
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,760
I'm doing all I can do.

445
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:05,640
I called Dr. Borneholm on the phone.

446
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,140
He'll be along any minute.

447
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,390
If only I hadn't bought that horse....

448
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:32,520
Don't blame yourself, Jordan.

449
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:38,520
If I hadn't, she'd be alive right now.

450
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:41,190
Don't blame yourself.

451
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:47,110
This is a great misfortune,
but no one is to blame.

452
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,120
Things happen.

453
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:12,720
-Mrs. Benedict, this is Dr. Borneholm.
-How do you do?

454
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:16,430
I sure wish I could've made it for Luz.

455
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,810
Dr. Walker did everything he could,
I assure you of that.

456
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,650
Dr. Walker, there's more for you to do,
I'm afraid.

457
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:30,950
Mrs. Obregon's baby is very sick.

458
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,830
His temperature must be at least 105.
Will you stop by, please?

459
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:37,830
Mrs. Obregon?

460
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:39,920
In the village.

461
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:42,290
Jett will take you.

462
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,470
I'll go with you myself, Doctor.

463
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,310
What is this?

464
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:03,730
You can't do that.

465
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:05,650
He can't go there.

466
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,740
He's our doctor.

467
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:10,320
-Our doctor?
-Yes.

468
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:12,910
You mean, the Benedicts' only?

469
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:16,040
No, I mean, all of us.

470
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:19,620
He doesn't tend those people.

471
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,790
They have a way of doing things
by themselves.

472
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:28,880
How did she get there?

473
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:33,390
Now, don't go climbing on me.
I don't feel too good about it.

474
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:37,140
Jordan, darling,
I don't think you quite understand.

475
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:41,190
There's a child who's very sick.
I must take Dr. Walker.

476
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:45,020
You'll go, won't you, Doctor?

477
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:50,070
I'll be back just as soon as I can.

478
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,960
I'm a lot better, honey.

479
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:46,630
That's a good boy.

480
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:55,220
Where's my horse?

481
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:01,430
I shot him.

482
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,520
Bone was broken.

483
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:10,480
Somebody had to do it.
I thought it'd be better if it was me.

484
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:16,610
The baby?

485
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:21,290
He is alive, thanks to Dr. Walker.

486
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:28,380
Good.

487
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:44,770
We need you in here for a few minutes
if you can break away.

488
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:48,310
You're sure holding up fine.

489
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,150
In times like this
folks really show what they're made of...

490
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:53,360
and you're sure holding up fine.

491
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:04,950
Vern and me thought a lot of Luz.

492
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,370
I guess everybody did.

493
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:09,460
At least everybody came.

494
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:12,880
It's the biggest gathering for a funeral
I ever saw in Texas.

495
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,300
It's a shame Luz wasn't here to enjoy it.

496
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,970
I mean, she always did like
a big get-together.

497
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:22,680
She'd have had a fine time.

498
00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:26,640
-Come to see us.
-Thank you. Bye-bye.

499
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:27,850
Come see us.

500
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,110
I think you'll agree, your sister
was a very generous woman.

501
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:40,530
She wanted that boy
to have something worthwhile.

502
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:44,030
Now, that little piece of land is worth...

503
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,500
$500, $600 at most.

504
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:51,830
I'm going to ask you, in reverence
to the memory of Luz Benedict...

505
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:55,670
I'm going to ask you
to give one Jett Rink...

506
00:57:56,550 --> 00:57:59,180
a check for twice the value of that land.

507
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:01,800
We can clean up the whole matter
right now.

508
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:15,070
Come inside, I want to talk to you.

509
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,650
Just a minute, Bick.

510
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:20,150
I'm afraid I'm going to beat you to it.

511
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:22,160
I'm quitting.

512
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,580
I lost the one friend I had in this place,
and I know it, too.

513
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:30,750
So I quit, I dead quit.
You don't have to say another word to me.

514
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,500
Nobody's firing you.

515
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:34,840
Boy, howdy, nobody's firing me.

516
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,130
I told you, I quit!

517
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:38,880
Nobody wants to fire you.

518
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:42,890
Come inside and listen
to what we have to say.

519
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,600
Come on in here, Jett.
Come on in here, boy.

520
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,020
Hi, Jett. Nice to see you.

521
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,770
-Howdy, Jett. Good to see you.
-Howdy, Jett.

522
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:55,440
Have my seat, boy. Sit right down.
You sure look good today.

523
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:00,240
Sit down. I'm going to tell you about
a piece of luck that's come your way.

524
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:03,450
Sit down, young man,
and make yourself comfortable.

525
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,790
It's a real bad wind
that doesn't blow somebody some good.

526
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:15,750
I don't have to tell you that Luz was
a woman of strong, sentimental feeling.

527
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,260
She prepared a list of things she wanted
to give all the people on Reata.

528
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:26,550
Yes. We find that she wanted to....

529
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:32,690
We find that her bequest to you was
in the nature of a little piece of ground.

530
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:37,310
It's the little piece we used to call
Buffalo Wallow.

531
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:45,990
She wanted to give you something.
I know she did.

532
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:52,290
It's always been my aim to try
to keep Reata intact within the family.

533
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:58,630
Now, that little piece is worth at most....
How much, Bale?

534
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:02,090
At the most, I'd say $500 or $600, Bick.

535
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:07,010
Mr. Benedict, wanting to honor
his sister's wishes...

536
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:11,350
and, of course, right along
with his own personal feeling for you....

537
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:15,900
He wants to see to it that you get
something really worthwhile.

538
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,320
Now, to get down to the point, Mr. Rink...

539
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:23,440
we're prepared to place in your hands,
in cash...

540
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:27,070
the sum of $1,200.

541
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:40,670
$1,200...

542
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:45,340
which, any of these gentlemen here
I'm sure will be happy to tell you...

543
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:47,590
is twice the value of that land.

544
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:51,350
-Definitely.
-At least twice the value of that land.

545
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:10,120
That's a lot of money.
What are you aiming do with all of it?

546
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:12,790
You're in the chips now, boy.

547
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:16,080
There it is. There it is, boy.

548
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:19,080
And it's all yours.

549
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:28,880
I don't know what to say.

550
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:34,520
She sure was a fine lady.

551
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,930
Yes, she was a fine lady. Hallelujah!

552
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:38,230
Amen.

553
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:50,740
I want you to know
that I appreciate her generosity.

554
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,620
Yours, too, Bick. And you all.

555
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:57,580
I want to thank you for it.

556
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:03,250
You know something, Bick?

557
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:08,300
I don't know, but it might not be...

558
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:12,510
<i>a pretty good idea
to gamble along with old Madama.</i>

559
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:16,600
How do you mean?

560
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:19,270
Just gamble on.

561
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,810
Just keep what she gave me.

562
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:31,490
I'm sentimental, too, Bick.

563
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:40,120
I think it's good to gamble on with her.

564
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:44,880
I know that land ain't worth much...

565
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,010
but then someday I just might up...

566
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,010
and put my own fence around her...

567
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:55,260
and call her Little Reata.

568
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,650
See you.

569
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:12,360
There's one thing on this earth more
important than money, and that's land!

570
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:14,990
I heard Luz say it a thousand times.

571
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:17,660
Pa said it and Bick, too. And it's true!

572
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:21,120
If you ever get to Deep Smith,
you come and pay us a visit.

573
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:23,580
We're just on the other side of Umbarger.

574
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:27,000
Only a little-bitty, no-account piece,
only we had a run of luck.

575
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:30,460
-Only? Why, a gusher came in last year.
-How wonderful.

576
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:32,840
Right now it's bringing in a million.

577
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:35,140
-A million gallons?
-Dollars.

578
01:03:35,590 --> 01:03:37,220
A million dollars a year?

579
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:39,010
A million dollars a month.

580
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:44,020
-Goodbye. Thanks for treating us right.
-Thank you for coming.

581
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:21,640
I just love talking to you, Uncle Bawley.

582
01:06:23,550 --> 01:06:25,850
Now that it's over, you get your fellow...

583
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:28,180
to take you around
and show you our country.

584
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:32,350
See San Antonio, Dallas and Houston.

585
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:36,320
I'm so impatient.
I want to see it all right now.

586
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:41,740
You don't have to hurry, honey.
It'll be here when you get around to it.

587
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:44,740
It's been here a long time.

588
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:50,210
And when you've seen it all
and have lived with it as I have...

589
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:55,960
in 25 years from now,
you'll feel about Texas just like I do.

590
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,090
Twenty-five years from now!

591
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:02,510
Twenty-five years from now
I'll be almost 50.

592
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,470
It's a nice age, Leslie.

593
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:09,430
You'll see wonderful things in Texas
when you're 50.

594
01:07:11,850 --> 01:07:13,020
Perhaps.

595
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:16,570
But I won't care as much then.

596
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:18,150
You'll care more.

597
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:22,280
Because then
you'll have been part of it all.

598
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:24,410
Come on, we need you in the powwow.

599
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,080
I'm coming, gentlemen.

600
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:38,130
You get with it, Gomez.
Get your people out.

601
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:41,760
I don't want any of them
sitting on their honkers come election day.

602
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:45,430
<i>Everything will be bueno, señor.
It will be the same: good.</i>

603
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:57,270
I love you.

604
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:01,440
Thank you.

605
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:05,070
We're just talking business. Just business.

606
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:08,580
Please, don't mind me.

607
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:11,120
Do go on.

608
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:15,710
I'll listen, quiet as a little old mouse.

609
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:19,800
You'd be bored, honey.

610
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:21,550
This is dull.

611
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:24,510
Why, I'd be fascinated.

612
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:29,350
We're talking about politics.

613
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:34,270
You married me in Washington,
remember, darling?

614
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:37,980
I lived next door to politics.
Brought up with it.

615
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:41,400
Please go on talking. I'd love it.

616
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:44,280
This is men's stuff.

617
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:48,780
Leslie, how about a cup of coffee
or a drink?

618
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:54,080
Men's stuff!

619
01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:57,920
Lord have mercy!

620
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:04,510
Set up my spinning wheel, girls.
I'll join the harem section in a minute.

621
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:09,510
Don't you go worrying
your pretty little head about politics.

622
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:13,020
You mean my pretty, empty head,
don't you, Judge?

623
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:18,350
Could I get the coffee for you?

624
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:23,190
You, too, Uncle Brutus?

625
01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:27,610
You don't feel well, Leslie.

626
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:30,200
I feel just great!

627
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:33,620
My adrenaline glands
are pumping beautifully.

628
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:40,080
If I may say so before retiring...

629
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,130
you gentlemen date back 100,000 years.

630
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:48,880
You ought to be wearing leopard skins
and carrying clubs.

631
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:50,260
Politics!

632
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:51,930
Business!

633
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:56,850
What's so masculine about a conversation
that a woman can't enter into it?

634
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,900
Leslie, you're tired.

635
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,570
Perhaps I am.

636
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:27,300
I reckon I'll go on upstairs
and get my beauty sleep.

637
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:29,130
You go ahead on, honey.

638
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,260
Good night, gentlemen.

639
01:10:44,110 --> 01:10:45,480
That's right.

640
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:49,650
Send the children on up to bed
so the grownups can talk.

641
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:55,280
Good night, honey.

642
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:33,820
I must have dropped off.

643
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:40,750
Darling, I am sorry
about my caveman speech.

644
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,170
I'll apologize to the others first thing,
I promise.

645
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:47,710
That's big of you.

646
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:51,130
You certainly distinguished yourself
this evening.

647
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:53,840
-Shh, they can hear.
-Hear? They heard you already.

648
01:11:53,930 --> 01:11:57,640
Every word you said out there.
We date back 100,000 years.

649
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:01,140
I said I was sorry about the name-calling.

650
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,520
It was very impolite, I know.

651
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:08,150
But in principle, I was absolutely right.

652
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,940
You come down here
and try to tell us how to run things.

653
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:14,360
Insulting my friends and everything.

654
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:16,660
Now you look here, Leslie.

655
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:20,200
You're my wife, Mrs. Jordan Benedict.

656
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:25,370
I'm asking you, when will you settle down
and behave like everybody else?

657
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:29,170
-Never!
-Who do you think you are, anyhow?

658
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:31,170
Joan of Arc, or something?

659
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,860
Jordan, where are you going?

660
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:53,030
Jordan, take off your hat.

661
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:58,030
Carrying on like Carrie Nation!

662
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:01,080
Preaching stuff that's none
of your business, fixing the world.

663
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:02,500
Why don't you join a club?

664
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:06,040
Honestly, Jordan.
You make me sound just awful.

665
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:11,210
I'm not all that bad.

666
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:15,050
You knew what a frightful girl I was
when you married me.

667
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:17,890
I did not deceive you, sir.

668
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:22,890
From the first moment,
I couldn't have been more unpleasant.

669
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:28,650
Anyway, you're stuck with me.

670
01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:35,690
Yes, I guess.

671
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:40,870
Honey, take your hat off.

672
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:56,260
Besides...

673
01:13:57,010 --> 01:13:58,720
you love me very much.

674
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:08,770
That fine mind of yours
gets pretty repulsive at times.

675
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,770
That's not what you told me on the train.

676
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:16,900
Now you're gonna throw that up to me.

677
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:18,900
I thought what we....

678
01:14:20,610 --> 01:14:23,280
I thought what we said on the train
was in confidence.

679
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:26,500
Of course, darling.

680
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:31,170
But I'll never forget a single word
you say to me.

681
01:14:32,210 --> 01:14:34,590
You can be pretty wonderful at times.

682
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:49,140
Come on, partner.

683
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:52,650
Why don't you kick off your spurs?

684
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:16,500
What a glorious, gorgeous,
brand-new day!

685
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:21,550
Let's spend every hour of it, just you and I.

686
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,430
Honey, I'm beat.

687
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:25,140
Why?

688
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:29,850
You have all the good things in the world.

689
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:33,020
And a woman
who loves you very, very much.

690
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:45,530
But that arguing takes a lot out of me.

691
01:15:51,370 --> 01:15:53,120
That was just frightful.

692
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:58,550
The best part about quarreling
is making up.

693
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:03,510
When we make up, we make up.
Don't we, honey?

694
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:11,140
Why can't we take a trip, really see Texas?
Just let somebody else run Reata.

695
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,390
Couldn't we?

696
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,610
Honey, I want you to understand this.

697
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:20,320
I run Reata at all times.

698
01:16:21,570 --> 01:16:23,070
That's the way it is.

699
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,820
Everything that's in it and on it
is run by me.

700
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:29,240
Don't raise your voice.

701
01:16:29,330 --> 01:16:31,410
That's the way it's always been.

702
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:35,040
Everything that has a Reata brand on it
is run by me.

703
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,590
Does that include me?

704
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:46,550
That's the way my father ran this outfit
and my grandfather, too. All of it.

705
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:50,060
He kept it together for his son,
and my father for his.

706
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:52,930
And I'm keeping it together for mine.

707
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,440
All 595,000 square miles?

708
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:56,980
All of it. For my son.

709
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,570
You could at least say " our son."

710
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:02,610
Our son.

711
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:07,820
Don't you think that might be
a little too much for one little baby?

712
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:09,950
Not if he's a Benedict.

713
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:17,290
You'd better hope this is a boy.

714
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:23,840
Our baby. I just said I'm hoping it's a boy.

715
01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:27,470
What do you mean?

716
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:30,220
Why didn't you tell me?

717
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:33,640
I'm telling you now.

718
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:41,230
Why didn't you tell me?
I mean, I should know.

719
01:17:43,690 --> 01:17:45,320
-Are you sure?
-Sure.

720
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:51,120
And our baby is going to be a boy.
I know it.

721
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:54,830
A boy very much like his father.

722
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,420
In many ways...

723
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:03,420
but not all.

724
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,890
Shouldn't she be putting on
a little weight?

725
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:21,610
It's natural, I think,
for him to be gaining faster.

726
01:18:22,690 --> 01:18:23,690
Let me see.

727
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:30,450
Very heavy.

728
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,500
Hello, sweetheart.

729
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,420
He's building up fine.

730
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:45,800
" I am now stronger than ever.

731
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:49,510
" I'm helping a young Dr. Guerra
get started here.

732
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:54,180
" Almost every day I find myself
walking three or four miles...

733
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:59,560
<i>" through the dusty and dirty streets
of Vientecito village. "</i>

734
01:19:09,530 --> 01:19:11,530
Hello, Angel. How are you?

735
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:13,530
Good.

736
01:19:19,370 --> 01:19:22,420
I'd like to speak to Mr. Gomez, the boss.

737
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,380
The man that runs this place.

738
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:26,960
Mrs. Benedict, what is it I can do?

739
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:31,090
Mr. Gomez, I'm going to leave
Dr. Guerra here with you.

740
01:19:31,510 --> 01:19:33,970
He'll tell you things
that must be done immediately.

741
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:36,180
This place is a scandal.

742
01:19:37,890 --> 01:19:40,730
Thank you, Dr. Guerra.
I'll get in touch with you.

743
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:16,470
Hello, Jett.

744
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:19,390
-Howdy, Miss Leslie.
-How are you?

745
01:20:20,770 --> 01:20:21,810
I'm doing good.

746
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:25,900
-You made some improvements.
-Do you like it?

747
01:20:26,110 --> 01:20:27,310
It looks good.

748
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:37,160
It ain't much yet, but it's coming along.

749
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:39,740
I wouldn't have believed it.

750
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:41,200
Believed what?

751
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:45,710
Truthfully, I didn't expect this sort
of talent to be one of your virtues.

752
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:51,380
That's the first time I was ever accused
of having any of that.

753
01:20:55,630 --> 01:20:58,640
It really is nice, Jett. Real nice.

754
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:01,270
Someday...

755
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:04,440
I'll have a place
that no one will be ashamed of.

756
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:15,820
I cut them out of the newspaper.

757
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:19,330
I thought maybe they'd kind of
dress the place up a little bit.

758
01:21:20,530 --> 01:21:21,540
Sweet of you.

759
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:35,840
Do you want to come on in here,
sit down and rest a minute?

760
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:37,180
Thank you.

761
01:21:48,230 --> 01:21:51,150
Having kids seems to agree with you,
you know?

762
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:54,360
You're looking prettier than ever.

763
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:57,360
Just as good, anyway.

764
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,710
My goodness, and tea!

765
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:16,550
You like tea, don't you?

766
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:20,510
I love it. It seems down here everybody
drinks gallons of coffee.

767
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:22,850
I know.

768
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:43,160
Mind if I pay you
a rather personal compliment?

769
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:47,660
What is it?

770
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:51,040
You make a very excellent cup of tea.

771
01:22:54,210 --> 01:22:56,760
I do a lot of things in a pinch.

772
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:06,470
Do you like one lump or do you like two?

773
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:09,770
I think I'll take mine straight.

774
01:23:10,770 --> 01:23:12,480
That's good enough for me.

775
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:22,990
That's not too good, is it?

776
01:23:23,910 --> 01:23:25,910
When will you get married, Jett?

777
01:23:26,450 --> 01:23:30,460
Don't you need somebody to help you
with this kind of responsibility?

778
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:35,750
When I get some time to look around,
I'll go back East and....

779
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:38,590
To Maryland, places like that.

780
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:43,720
You got any attractive sisters there that
might be interested in some poor people?

781
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:47,470
Money isn't all, you know?

782
01:23:49,310 --> 01:23:51,230
Not when you've got it.

783
01:23:58,690 --> 01:24:00,690
The other people around here...

784
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:03,910
why don't they help themselves
like you've done?

785
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:09,290
When you say " other people,"
what do you mean?

786
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:16,250
I've just come back from Vientecito.

787
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:19,000
That bunch of wetbacks?

788
01:24:19,630 --> 01:24:22,470
You don't go mixing me up
with none of them.

789
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:27,970
I'm just as much of Texas
as Bick Benedict is.

790
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,520
-I'm no wetback.
-I know that.

791
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:40,900
You're very like Jordan in that respect.
Attitude, everything.

792
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:45,410
But your situation is so different.
You're a working man.

793
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:50,120
That's something I'm gonna try to fix.

794
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:53,250
Someday I will.

795
01:24:55,830 --> 01:24:57,130
All right, Gomez.

796
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:03,090
Yes, I understand.

797
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:04,720
Yes, thank you.

798
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:09,850
Thanks for the tea party, Jett.

799
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,680
And don't be such a stranger.

800
01:25:15,230 --> 01:25:17,190
Stop by and pay us a visit.

801
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,190
I don't know about that.

802
01:25:20,270 --> 01:25:22,690
Bick's still got his kettle on for me.

803
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,090
Leslie.

804
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:46,880
Hello, darling.

805
01:25:48,930 --> 01:25:50,970
I was just having tea with Jett Rink.

806
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:54,060
Gomez telephoned.
"Mrs. Benedict went to Vientecito.

807
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,560
" I hope you're not displeased," he said.

808
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:59,610
I've told you before....
What's this about Jett Rink?

809
01:26:00,110 --> 01:26:03,110
He made tea. Isn't that unbelievable?

810
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:06,030
He does so want to improve himself.

811
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:10,830
But your man Gomez, that camp he runs....

812
01:26:12,830 --> 01:26:13,830
It's hopeless.

813
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:17,040
You can't go around this place
with no regard for who you are...

814
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:18,870
interfering with those people.

815
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:21,500
Jordan, that place is a scandal.

816
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:24,380
Dr. Guerra threw his hands up in horror.

817
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:26,260
That's his problem.

818
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:30,180
You've been a powerful Texan for
100 years. Why don't you do something?

819
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:32,300
I'm not the Red Cross, I'm a cow man.

820
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:34,060
If you won't, I will.

821
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:36,060
If you go near those dumps again...

822
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:39,020
if I ever hear you get mixed up
in this migratory mess--

823
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:40,520
-What?
-I'll leave you!

824
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:43,020
That's what I'll do, I'll leave you!

825
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:49,610
There's my darling little girl.

826
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:54,910
Did you think your naughty mama was
never going to come up to see you?

827
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:57,540
One thing you can be sure of:

828
01:26:57,620 --> 01:27:01,170
One of these days I'll run
that Jett Rink's hide out of this country.

829
01:27:26,110 --> 01:27:28,940
Say hello to Luz. Say, " Hello, Luz."

830
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:34,740
Look there. Say hello to little Luz.

831
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:41,710
I don't care what you say.
She does look like Luz.

832
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:43,710
Oh, honey.

833
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:48,630
We're all gathered for the fourth
anniversary of my son's birth.

834
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:50,880
And your daughter's.

835
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:56,060
And I want to take
this auspicious occasion...

836
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:59,060
to say that this young fellow here...

837
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:02,810
is gonna grow up to be
one of Reata's top hands.

838
01:28:05,310 --> 01:28:07,820
I mean, this boy's gonna be the best.

839
01:28:09,650 --> 01:28:12,660
Maybe he'll even grow up
to be better than his old man.

840
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:15,070
Girls, look at the pony.

841
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:23,830
There he is, son.

842
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:25,880
He's all yours.

843
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:27,920
All mine, Daddy?

844
01:28:50,690 --> 01:28:52,190
Take him around, Angel.

845
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:05,880
Take it easy, son.

846
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:07,750
He doesn't want to.

847
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:09,920
I rode before I could walk.

848
01:29:11,050 --> 01:29:14,220
But that was you.
He's another person entirely.

849
01:29:14,590 --> 01:29:19,310
He is a Benedict. He's gonna stay
on that saddle if I have to tie him on.

850
01:29:37,450 --> 01:29:38,700
Take him away.

851
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:44,710
-No.
-Let him ride, Polo.

852
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:46,960
Let him ride.

853
01:29:57,430 --> 01:30:00,100
Take him up for his nap. I think he's tired.

854
01:30:39,430 --> 01:30:41,430
That wasn't so bad, was it, son?

855
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:13,460
Bick knows everything about running
a ranch. Bone, hide and hair.

856
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:17,840
He doesn't know a thing
about raising kids...

857
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:19,840
any more than his father did.

858
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:22,340
You just stay with it your way...

859
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:26,350
and help those children grow up to be
what they want to be.

860
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:28,890
I will, Uncle Bawley. I promise.

861
01:31:33,770 --> 01:31:35,770
We're going to hit the hay.

862
01:31:39,950 --> 01:31:42,280
-Good night, Leslie.
-Good night.

863
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:46,830
-Good night.
-Good night.

864
01:31:53,290 --> 01:31:55,040
It's time for me to turn in.

865
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:02,300
-Good night, Bick.
-Good night, Bawley.

866
01:32:06,510 --> 01:32:10,020
Good night, everybody.
Don't forget to turn off the rain.

867
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:39,090
Are you tired?

868
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:41,300
No.

869
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:49,770
What's happening is we're getting
on each other's nerves.

870
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:51,100
Could be.

871
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:57,900
We've been together every day and night
since we first met.

872
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:00,780
Is that bad?

873
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:03,240
No.

874
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:08,450
We're getting in the habit
of snapping at each other...

875
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:14,620
about things
we should've adjusted to years ago.

876
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:26,300
I think it would be a good idea
if I took the children home for a visit.

877
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:28,800
Home?

878
01:33:33,770 --> 01:33:35,390
If you're homesick....

879
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:38,650
I mean, if that's the way you want it.

880
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:42,400
-That's not the way I want it, Jordan.
-All right, then.

881
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:51,040
It'll be better for us
if we're apart for a while.

882
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:54,500
Better for us and the children.

883
01:33:56,830 --> 01:33:59,960
It'll give us both a chance
to think things over.

884
01:34:10,050 --> 01:34:11,680
You know best, I guess.

885
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,180
I think it will be best.

886
01:35:06,570 --> 01:35:08,030
-Hi, there.
-'Morning.

887
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:10,030
Fine day for riding.

888
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:11,700
Just magnificent.

889
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:15,370
See you later.

890
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:20,040
She's a lucky girl.

891
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:24,750
If I had it to do again,
I'd still walk off with Jordan.

892
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,630
Even if I knew it'd end like this.

893
01:35:30,430 --> 01:35:32,300
You have no time to be homesick...

894
01:35:32,390 --> 01:35:35,350
with this wedding and Thanksgiving
on us together.

895
01:35:38,810 --> 01:35:40,480
Pedro, come here.

896
01:35:44,190 --> 01:35:46,530
Pedro, eat your dinner like a good boy.

897
01:36:16,510 --> 01:36:21,270
Merciful Father, we bow our heads
in gratitude on this Thanksgiving Day.

898
01:36:22,270 --> 01:36:25,770
We give thee humble and hearty thanks
for this, thy bounty...

899
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:29,440
beseeching thee to continue
thy loving kindness...

900
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:35,280
that our land may still yield her increase,
to thy glory and our comfort.

901
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:36,990
Amen.

902
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:44,500
Is that Pedro?

903
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:47,040
Yes, darling.

904
01:37:30,170 --> 01:37:32,510
It's a day
when we're supposed to be happy.

905
01:37:34,510 --> 01:37:36,140
Come on now, smile.

906
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:38,140
Like Mommy.

907
01:37:47,610 --> 01:37:49,360
Is something wrong, Miss Leslie?

908
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,450
Now maybe you'll stop crying.

909
01:38:02,290 --> 01:38:04,790
It's a message to you from your father.

910
01:38:05,330 --> 01:38:07,330
Is he gonna be here for dinner?

911
01:38:10,090 --> 01:38:11,090
No...

912
01:38:12,130 --> 01:38:15,930
but he says,
"I hope my darlings are all very happy.

913
01:38:17,130 --> 01:38:21,810
" I want them to know I miss them
very much and love each one very much."

914
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:09,940
I could see you coming.
Why, Mr. Benedict, this is a good surprise!

915
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:15,280
We're having a wedding.
Sure is plenty of excitement.

916
01:40:22,010 --> 01:40:23,680
" Dearly beloved...

917
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:28,520
" we are gathered here in the sight of God
and in the face of this company...

918
01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:33,690
" to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony...

919
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:38,280
" which is an honorable estate
instituted of God.

920
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:43,610
" David, wilt thou have this woman
for thy wedded wife?

921
01:40:43,950 --> 01:40:48,620
" To live together after God's ordinance
in the holiest state of matrimony?

922
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:52,790
" Wilt thou love her, comfort her,
honor her...

923
01:40:53,170 --> 01:40:57,840
" and keep her in sickness and in health,
and forsaking all others...

924
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:02,800
" keep thee only unto her
so long as you both shall live?"

925
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:04,800
I will.

926
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:09,430
" Lacey, wilt thou have this man
for thy wedded husband...

927
01:41:09,930 --> 01:41:14,600
" to live together after God's ordinance
in the holiest state of matrimony?

928
01:41:15,770 --> 01:41:19,530
" Wilt thou love him, comfort him,
honor him...

929
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:24,910
" and keep him in sickness and in health,
and forsaking all others...

930
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:29,870
" keep thee only unto him
so long as you both shall live?"

931
01:41:29,950 --> 01:41:30,950
I will.

932
01:41:31,450 --> 01:41:33,790
" Bless, O Lord, this ring...

933
01:41:34,210 --> 01:41:38,880
" that he who gives it and she
who wears it may abide in thy peace...

934
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:43,550
" and continue in thy favor
unto their life's end.

935
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:44,800
" Amen."

936
01:41:49,310 --> 01:41:51,390
With this ring, I thee wed.

937
01:41:54,140 --> 01:41:58,650
" Those whom God hath joined together,
let no man put asunder.

938
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:05,400
" For as much as David and Lacey have
consented together in holy wedlock...

939
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:10,910
" I pronounce that they are man and wife."

940
01:42:43,980 --> 01:42:47,320
Are you ready to come back
to your old, beat-up cowhand?

941
01:42:50,780 --> 01:42:53,290
I'm no different than I was when I left.

942
01:42:54,950 --> 01:42:58,500
We Texans like a little vinegar
with our greens. It gives them flavor.

943
01:43:29,700 --> 01:43:31,530
What do you think of old King Tut?

944
01:43:31,620 --> 01:43:33,700
Boy, howdy, that's some hunk of beef!

945
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:35,330
He's gonna make history, too.

946
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:38,870
When Bick finishes this breeding program,
he'll have an animal...

947
01:43:39,170 --> 01:43:42,210
that's 99 percent beef
and the rest exaggeration.

948
01:44:43,150 --> 01:44:45,820
Say, Ollie, do you see that?

949
01:44:47,530 --> 01:44:49,070
That's Rink's truck.

950
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:51,820
I don't want him
hauling through my place.

951
01:44:53,110 --> 01:44:57,120
Jett's got the easement, Bick.
He's got a right to go through the land.

952
01:44:57,740 --> 01:44:59,250
No two ways about that.

953
01:44:59,330 --> 01:45:02,000
I'm tired of his prospecting.
I want him out of here.

954
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:05,920
He's borrowed about all he could.
He's down to his last collar button.

955
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,340
Sure he is.

956
01:45:09,670 --> 01:45:13,430
Buy him out, Ollie.
Buy him out and get him out of here.

957
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:17,950
Hello, Jett.

958
01:46:18,030 --> 01:46:19,330
What do you want?

959
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:32,090
My well came in, Bick.

960
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:36,720
Fine.

961
01:46:39,260 --> 01:46:40,850
That's wonderful, Jett.

962
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:44,850
Everybody thought I had a duster.

963
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:50,310
You all thought Spindletop and
Burkburnett was all the oil there was.

964
01:46:51,070 --> 01:46:54,280
I'm here to tell you it ain't, boy. It's here.

965
01:46:55,690 --> 01:46:58,360
There ain't a dang thing
you gonna do about it.

966
01:46:58,610 --> 01:47:00,320
My well came in big, so big.

967
01:47:00,910 --> 01:47:03,290
And there's more down there,
bigger wells.

968
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:10,790
I'm rich, Bick!

969
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:17,130
I'm a rich one. I'm a rich boy.

970
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:22,390
I'm gonna have more money
than you ever thought you could have.

971
01:47:22,510 --> 01:47:25,140
You and the rest of you
stinking sons of Benedicts.

972
01:47:26,730 --> 01:47:29,690
Leslie, go into the house.
Take the women with you.

973
01:47:30,230 --> 01:47:32,230
Jett, we're glad you struck oil.

974
01:47:33,270 --> 01:47:34,860
Now, you go on along home.

975
01:47:37,190 --> 01:47:39,860
My, you sure do look pretty, Miss Leslie.

976
01:47:41,950 --> 01:47:43,780
You always did look pretty.

977
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:46,950
Pretty, good enough to eat.

978
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:53,040
Wait a minute.

979
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:55,050
Take it easy!

980
01:47:59,220 --> 01:48:00,550
You're touchy, Bick.

981
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:03,970
Touchy as an old cook.

982
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:25,280
You should have shot him a long time ago.

983
01:48:25,370 --> 01:48:27,120
Now he's too rich to kill.

984
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:16,360
Tell your client that Reata is my property.

985
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:18,740
And the name of Reata is my property.

986
01:49:19,070 --> 01:49:21,200
The Texas courts are fair.

987
01:49:21,740 --> 01:49:25,410
He is to cease using the name of my ranch
in his oil schemes.

988
01:49:25,530 --> 01:49:29,410
I won't have oil digging on Reata.
I won't stand for its name being used.

989
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:30,790
Is that clear?

990
01:50:00,150 --> 01:50:01,150
Mom?

991
01:50:03,740 --> 01:50:04,910
Mother?

992
01:50:20,590 --> 01:50:23,510
They say Aunt Luz was really in love
with Jett Rink herself.

993
01:50:23,590 --> 01:50:26,100
Even if she was old enough
to be his mother.

994
01:50:26,260 --> 01:50:27,350
Now, Luz....

995
01:50:27,430 --> 01:50:29,390
She was a character.

996
01:50:29,850 --> 01:50:32,520
She was always trying to keep him
from getting married.

997
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:34,600
He had to run off to marry you.

998
01:50:34,940 --> 01:50:36,020
What's that?

999
01:50:36,770 --> 01:50:38,020
Who said what?

1000
01:50:38,690 --> 01:50:40,150
Somebody. I forget.

1001
01:50:44,860 --> 01:50:46,820
You know what they say?

1002
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:50,950
That every girl in Texas was trying
to catch Papa.

1003
01:50:51,950 --> 01:50:53,210
They said, quote:

1004
01:50:53,330 --> 01:50:56,830
" There wasn't a prize bull like him
since Sam Houston got married."

1005
01:50:57,710 --> 01:50:59,000
That's enough from her.

1006
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:04,590
I'm sure it's quite true, darling.
It took me two whole days to land him.

1007
01:51:07,390 --> 01:51:11,220
Really? It all sounds so fascinating
and uncouth.

1008
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:35,920
Where are you going?

1009
01:51:37,250 --> 01:51:39,710
Down the road to Smitty's for Coke.

1010
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:40,840
With who?

1011
01:51:41,050 --> 01:51:41,960
Nobody.

1012
01:51:43,130 --> 01:51:44,300
Stay at home.

1013
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:50,100
Hey, you!

1014
01:51:55,270 --> 01:51:56,270
Hello, Papa.

1015
01:51:57,770 --> 01:51:58,690
Hi.

1016
01:51:59,610 --> 01:52:00,770
Where have you been?

1017
01:52:00,860 --> 01:52:02,650
Down the road for a Coke.

1018
01:52:03,110 --> 01:52:04,110
With who?

1019
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:05,190
Bob.

1020
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:12,700
-Howdy, Mr. Benedict.
-Hello, Bob.

1021
01:52:15,370 --> 01:52:17,500
Well, good night, Mr. Benedict.

1022
01:52:17,830 --> 01:52:19,460
Excuse me, Papa.

1023
01:52:32,890 --> 01:52:35,140
Look, Papa, are you busy now?

1024
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:37,980
Never too busy for you, young fellow.

1025
01:52:38,890 --> 01:52:40,600
What's on your mind?

1026
01:52:41,110 --> 01:52:43,230
Well, Daddy, it's like this.

1027
01:52:43,820 --> 01:52:45,780
I am, Mama. I'm going to be.

1028
01:52:46,490 --> 01:52:49,490
I want to go to Harvard
and then to Columbia premed.

1029
01:52:51,410 --> 01:52:53,200
So you want to be a doctor?

1030
01:52:53,990 --> 01:52:54,990
Yes.

1031
01:52:58,250 --> 01:53:01,920
How about Reata, Jordy?
He's counting on you to take over.

1032
01:53:03,790 --> 01:53:06,090
Yes, I know he is. I know it.

1033
01:53:07,420 --> 01:53:10,590
But there are 50,000 guys who can do it
better than I can.

1034
01:53:11,260 --> 01:53:14,100
I don't want to live my life
pushing cows around.

1035
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:19,020
I'd die for Papa if I had to.

1036
01:53:19,690 --> 01:53:23,650
Your father doesn't want you to die
for him. He wants you to live for him.

1037
01:53:23,980 --> 01:53:25,940
Talk to her, will you, Daddy?

1038
01:53:27,190 --> 01:53:28,490
Reason with her.

1039
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:31,990
I don't want this pinned on me.

1040
01:53:32,110 --> 01:53:33,910
I'll take all the blame.

1041
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:37,330
You just sort of soften the blow a little bit.

1042
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:40,160
I'll talk to him myself.

1043
01:53:40,370 --> 01:53:42,830
You can persuade him, Mom.
I know you can.

1044
01:53:43,540 --> 01:53:45,500
It's not gonna be easy, honey.

1045
01:53:48,550 --> 01:53:50,680
Maybe I can catch her at a weak moment.

1046
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:53,720
You can do it, Daddy. I know you can.

1047
01:53:59,310 --> 01:54:01,520
Darling, I've been thinking....

1048
01:54:02,690 --> 01:54:03,770
Me, too.

1049
01:54:07,230 --> 01:54:08,780
About the children.

1050
01:54:10,190 --> 01:54:12,070
That's funny. Me, too.

1051
01:54:17,490 --> 01:54:19,120
We must be getting old.

1052
01:54:19,830 --> 01:54:21,290
Speak for yourself.

1053
01:54:24,830 --> 01:54:29,050
I wonder if we love them enough
to do what's really right for them.

1054
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:31,420
Why, sure.

1055
01:54:34,430 --> 01:54:35,590
I hope so.

1056
01:54:37,850 --> 01:54:38,930
I mean...

1057
01:54:40,270 --> 01:54:42,730
so we love them too much perhaps.

1058
01:54:43,730 --> 01:54:47,400
So much that we keep from doing
what's right for them.

1059
01:54:48,820 --> 01:54:49,780
Not me.

1060
01:54:52,780 --> 01:54:54,820
You don't have to worry about me.

1061
01:55:01,250 --> 01:55:02,540
It's always the mother.

1062
01:55:04,870 --> 01:55:08,920
The theory is she doesn't want
her fledglings to leave her nest.

1063
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:15,720
Try their own wings. All that sort of stuff.

1064
01:55:18,890 --> 01:55:20,100
You mean...

1065
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:24,310
you'd be perfectly willing to sacrifice?

1066
01:55:26,150 --> 01:55:27,150
Yeah.

1067
01:55:29,270 --> 01:55:32,110
I'd sacrifice for her. You know that.

1068
01:55:53,170 --> 01:55:56,010
I'm not so sold on that...

1069
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:00,850
girl's school in Switzerland
you're stuck on.

1070
01:56:01,100 --> 01:56:03,060
Now, don't get your feathers up.

1071
01:56:04,020 --> 01:56:06,230
Judy's not crazy about that school either.

1072
01:56:06,350 --> 01:56:09,360
Of course she isn't.
That's exactly why she needs to go.

1073
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:12,150
I wouldn't push her.

1074
01:56:15,610 --> 01:56:16,700
She...

1075
01:56:18,030 --> 01:56:19,990
wants to go to Texas Tech.

1076
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:21,910
That's a man's school.

1077
01:56:22,540 --> 01:56:24,000
Girls go, too.

1078
01:56:24,870 --> 01:56:28,370
It's got the best animal husbandry course
in the country, she says.

1079
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:37,550
She wants to be a rancher,
like her old man.

1080
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:40,180
Like Bob Dace.

1081
01:56:40,970 --> 01:56:45,680
She's just got her little schoolgirl crush
on that hulking Bob Dace.

1082
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:49,690
She's got her mind set on it.

1083
01:56:50,730 --> 01:56:52,190
That's what she wants.

1084
01:56:53,480 --> 01:56:55,990
And I, for one, am willing to sacrifice.

1085
01:57:24,100 --> 01:57:25,350
What do you say?

1086
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:33,770
It seems we've hatched
an odd pair of fledglings.

1087
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:40,700
Brace yourself.

1088
01:57:41,450 --> 01:57:43,490
Jordy wants to be a doctor.

1089
01:57:46,450 --> 01:57:47,410
He wants what?

1090
01:57:47,540 --> 01:57:49,750
He wants to be a doctor.
He's absolutely set on it.

1091
01:57:49,870 --> 01:57:52,540
Over my dead body!
You know what he's supposed to do.

1092
01:57:52,630 --> 01:57:53,710
Well, he's not.

1093
01:57:54,790 --> 01:57:59,010
He'd die for you, but he's not gonna
live his life for you. And he's right.

1094
01:57:59,420 --> 01:58:01,130
He'll do as we've all done.

1095
01:58:03,180 --> 01:58:07,470
He wants to go to Harvard first,
then Columbia premed.

1096
01:58:09,930 --> 01:58:12,230
You're pretty handy with those terms.

1097
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:16,070
I can see who's been cooking this thing up.

1098
01:58:22,240 --> 01:58:23,320
Of course...

1099
01:58:24,620 --> 01:58:27,370
this would mean a big sacrifice
on your part.

1100
01:58:45,890 --> 01:58:48,560
No matter where he goes to school...

1101
01:58:49,720 --> 01:58:52,390
he comes right back home and runs Reata.

1102
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:01,820
I guess you were right about one thing.

1103
01:59:04,490 --> 01:59:05,610
Me?

1104
01:59:06,570 --> 01:59:07,740
On one thing.

1105
01:59:10,240 --> 01:59:11,950
We are getting old.

1106
01:59:13,330 --> 01:59:14,290
Who?

1107
01:59:14,750 --> 01:59:15,960
We are, Jordan.

1108
01:59:19,170 --> 01:59:21,130
We are the older generation.

1109
01:59:23,260 --> 01:59:24,340
Aren't we?

1110
01:59:25,470 --> 01:59:26,550
Suddenly?

1111
01:59:34,850 --> 01:59:36,150
I guess so.

1112
01:59:49,740 --> 01:59:52,750
" ...unless oil or gas shall have been struck
at a lesser depth."

1113
01:59:52,830 --> 01:59:55,120
Is that about Vashti Hake's ranch?

1114
01:59:57,420 --> 01:59:58,170
Yes.

1115
02:00:00,210 --> 02:00:01,170
Good.

1116
02:00:02,210 --> 02:00:03,260
How about Reata?

1117
02:00:04,130 --> 02:00:07,470
No. That Benedict is a hard guy to crack.

1118
02:00:15,230 --> 02:00:17,520
Let's just keep punching, boys.

1119
02:00:52,050 --> 02:00:53,140
Hospital!

1120
02:00:53,600 --> 02:00:55,140
What's he covering up now?

1121
02:00:55,980 --> 02:00:59,150
He'll overstep the mark one of these days.

1122
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:00,730
Give him enough rope.

1123
02:01:01,650 --> 02:01:04,110
Give him enough rope, and he'll hang you.

1124
02:01:06,110 --> 02:01:07,070
I'll get it.

1125
02:01:11,570 --> 02:01:12,740
Hello.

1126
02:01:16,120 --> 02:01:17,910
No, this is her daughter.

1127
02:01:23,210 --> 02:01:25,670
You'll have to find out for yourself.

1128
02:01:26,760 --> 02:01:29,760
-Take your social life on the other phone.
-It's for you.

1129
02:01:29,970 --> 02:01:31,430
I think he's nice.

1130
02:01:31,510 --> 02:01:33,140
-Who's nice?
-Jett Rink.

1131
02:01:35,930 --> 02:01:37,310
I don't want to talk to him.

1132
02:01:37,430 --> 02:01:38,810
What do I tell him?

1133
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:42,100
Let me talk. I'll tell him.

1134
02:01:42,650 --> 02:01:44,020
I'll talk to him.

1135
02:01:50,780 --> 02:01:53,200
You've heard from me before on this, Jett.

1136
02:01:53,620 --> 02:01:56,040
Judge Whiteside told you, and I told you.

1137
02:01:56,200 --> 02:02:00,330
This is a cattle ranch, not an oil field.
That's the way it's gonna stay.

1138
02:02:03,250 --> 02:02:06,250
That's about the most expensive
phone call you ever made, Bick.

1139
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:09,470
It'll cost you a billion dollars a year
for the next 50 years.

1140
02:02:09,590 --> 02:02:13,970
Couldn't we have just one little, itty-bitty
oil well, so I can get a private phone?

1141
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:35,660
<i>After reporting to President Roosevelt,
the Naval Secretary told the press...</i>

1142
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:39,830
<i>that the battleship Arizona
and five other warships were lost...</i>

1143
02:02:39,950 --> 02:02:44,670
<i>in the Japanese air raid
on Pearl Harbor a fortnight ago.</i>

1144
02:02:45,710 --> 02:02:47,840
<i>He reported that 91 officers...</i>

1145
02:02:48,380 --> 02:02:52,510
<i>and 2,638 enlisted men were known dead.</i>

1146
02:02:58,970 --> 02:03:01,810
That only makes me realize I'm losing you.

1147
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:27,980
Here they are.

1148
02:04:30,980 --> 02:04:32,780
When did you two sneak in?

1149
02:04:33,030 --> 02:04:34,650
The honeymooners!

1150
02:04:40,830 --> 02:04:43,740
Judy, you're gonna get it.
You know Mom wanted a big wedding.

1151
02:04:43,870 --> 02:04:45,660
That's not true, Luz.

1152
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,460
Not quite true.

1153
02:05:24,540 --> 02:05:26,580
We came for you to see Angel.

1154
02:05:27,870 --> 02:05:30,330
He's the first soldier from Reata.

1155
02:05:30,710 --> 02:05:33,540
-Merry Christmas, Polo.
-Merry Christmas.

1156
02:05:38,220 --> 02:05:40,510
Isn't he a fine-looking soldier?

1157
02:05:42,140 --> 02:05:43,600
Just a minute.

1158
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:50,520
Merry Christmas, Angel.

1159
02:05:50,650 --> 02:05:51,650
Thank you.

1160
02:05:51,850 --> 02:05:55,690
Today the wish of all of us is
that the war ends quickly...

1161
02:05:56,440 --> 02:05:59,780
and that you, Angel,
return safely to Reata...

1162
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:04,370
and to all of those
who love you very much.

1163
02:06:04,740 --> 02:06:06,870
I'll drink a toast to that.

1164
02:06:09,080 --> 02:06:11,040
Come on, now, and open it.

1165
02:06:38,780 --> 02:06:41,450
-Hello, Dr. Guerra.
-Hello, Dr. Benedict.

1166
02:06:42,110 --> 02:06:44,070
Just a little premature.

1167
02:06:44,160 --> 02:06:45,410
I know, it takes time.

1168
02:06:46,200 --> 02:06:48,080
Jordan, this is Juana.

1169
02:06:49,450 --> 02:06:52,120
She's been training out at the hospital.

1170
02:06:55,250 --> 02:06:57,920
It must be that darn north wind static.

1171
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:04,680
Don't tell me you haven't learned that
dry wind, friction, and a heavy carpet...

1172
02:07:05,140 --> 02:07:08,760
are not the only means of creating
electricity between human beings.

1173
02:07:23,860 --> 02:07:24,910
Thank you.

1174
02:07:30,540 --> 02:07:33,620
Could you stay and give me the lowdown
on what it's like?

1175
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:44,130
-Very nice to meet you.
-Nice meeting you.

1176
02:07:44,630 --> 02:07:46,430
<i>-Goodbye.
-Adiós.</i>

1177
02:07:48,970 --> 02:07:52,480
-Let's get some Christmas cheer.
-You talked me into it!

1178
02:08:00,860 --> 02:08:04,360
Friends, we're gonna have
a mighty triumphant Christmas.

1179
02:08:06,530 --> 02:08:09,700
I'm gonna drink a toast
to two young men of Reata.

1180
02:08:11,620 --> 02:08:12,700
My two sons.

1181
02:08:21,500 --> 02:08:23,380
Thank you, Mr. Benedict.

1182
02:08:28,590 --> 02:08:31,260
Better take it easy on the bourbon, Dad.

1183
02:08:32,220 --> 02:08:33,770
It's not good for you.

1184
02:08:34,890 --> 02:08:36,350
I'm not kidding you.

1185
02:08:42,320 --> 02:08:44,280
I hate to see Angel go.

1186
02:08:44,780 --> 02:08:48,110
That boy is the best dang man
on the place.

1187
02:08:53,580 --> 02:08:58,290
It's time for you to take your place here,
to produce beef for the war.

1188
02:08:59,290 --> 02:09:02,630
They need doctors, Dad.
They need doctors in war, too.

1189
02:09:04,420 --> 02:09:06,880
I want to finish medical school if I can.

1190
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:09,550
You are being bull-headed.

1191
02:09:11,100 --> 02:09:13,930
I never would be any good
at running this place.

1192
02:09:15,850 --> 02:09:17,980
Any man on Reata can do it better.

1193
02:09:18,230 --> 02:09:19,850
You're the one.

1194
02:09:21,270 --> 02:09:23,730
You're the one with a responsibility
to Reata.

1195
02:09:23,860 --> 02:09:26,860
Your blood pressure is going up
just while we're talking here.

1196
02:09:28,280 --> 02:09:30,780
Please, it isn't good for you. Just relax.

1197
02:09:30,910 --> 02:09:32,870
Don't you get fresh with me.

1198
02:09:39,620 --> 02:09:41,080
We're talking.

1199
02:09:41,460 --> 02:09:42,920
Yes, I heard.

1200
02:09:43,960 --> 02:09:48,420
It's Christmas morning. Isn't this
something you could discuss tomorrow?

1201
02:09:50,050 --> 02:09:52,010
There's nothing to discuss.

1202
02:09:52,350 --> 02:09:55,850
When I come home,
I'll work with Dr. Guerra in Vientecito.

1203
02:09:58,770 --> 02:10:02,100
I love Texas as much as you do.
I want to work here.

1204
02:10:03,020 --> 02:10:06,110
I just want to work in a different way,
that's all.

1205
02:10:07,780 --> 02:10:08,990
Come on, Jordan.

1206
02:10:11,030 --> 02:10:12,570
Work with Guerra!

1207
02:10:24,920 --> 02:10:26,630
Here's to you, Mr. Benedict.

1208
02:10:31,550 --> 02:10:33,590
You look beat, Mr. Benedict.

1209
02:10:33,720 --> 02:10:34,680
Here's to you.

1210
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:36,510
It's pretty good stuff.

1211
02:10:37,260 --> 02:10:39,060
Did you make that yourself?.

1212
02:10:40,810 --> 02:10:42,770
Yes, I make it every year.

1213
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:46,360
It's my Christmas special.

1214
02:10:46,900 --> 02:10:48,780
No, I mean the liquor.

1215
02:10:49,110 --> 02:10:51,070
Did you make the liquor yourself?.

1216
02:10:51,530 --> 02:10:55,490
If not, it's about the only thing
you don't produce on Reata yourself.

1217
02:11:00,290 --> 02:11:01,910
Come here and sit down.

1218
02:11:02,620 --> 02:11:04,580
I've got some serious talk
to make with you.

1219
02:11:12,090 --> 02:11:15,590
I've been watching you pretty close
for a lot of years.

1220
02:11:20,350 --> 02:11:21,980
You're a ranchman.

1221
02:11:23,770 --> 02:11:25,400
And you're smart.

1222
02:11:34,700 --> 02:11:37,240
You're wondering why I'm talking to you.

1223
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:46,290
Bob Dace...

1224
02:11:47,500 --> 02:11:48,960
look me right in the eye.

1225
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:57,510
You could never be anything but a rancher,
could you?

1226
02:11:57,850 --> 02:11:59,470
-No, sir.
-That's my boy.

1227
02:11:59,640 --> 02:12:02,060
But somebody else thinks I could.

1228
02:12:04,100 --> 02:12:05,060
Not my Judy.

1229
02:12:05,190 --> 02:12:06,730
-No, sir, it's not Judy.
-Who?

1230
02:12:07,940 --> 02:12:09,650
President Roosevelt.

1231
02:12:12,690 --> 02:12:14,150
Listen to this:

1232
02:12:18,700 --> 02:12:20,830
" To Robert Haskell Dace.

1233
02:12:21,830 --> 02:12:25,960
" Greetings from the President
of the United States."

1234
02:12:26,120 --> 02:12:27,420
Let me see that.

1235
02:12:30,170 --> 02:12:34,300
" You are hereby notified to report
on December 28...

1236
02:12:34,630 --> 02:12:36,590
" 5:00 a.m. for induction."

1237
02:12:42,600 --> 02:12:44,060
It don't matter.

1238
02:12:45,560 --> 02:12:48,020
Your job won't let you leave this place.

1239
02:12:48,350 --> 02:12:51,940
It'll make you stay right here.
This is just as important as carrying a gun.

1240
02:12:52,020 --> 02:12:54,280
I appreciate your confidence, sir.

1241
02:12:55,240 --> 02:12:58,660
But this is one thing
I'm not gonna try to get out of.

1242
02:13:02,410 --> 02:13:04,620
Have it your way. You might as well...

1243
02:13:05,450 --> 02:13:07,710
everybody else does around here.

1244
02:13:10,130 --> 02:13:13,630
I'll show you my heart's in the right place.

1245
02:13:14,460 --> 02:13:17,380
When you come back
after the war is over...

1246
02:13:18,260 --> 02:13:19,720
the job's yours.

1247
02:13:19,890 --> 02:13:21,850
It'll be waiting for you.

1248
02:13:23,810 --> 02:13:25,350
I couldn't take it, sir.

1249
02:13:25,470 --> 02:13:27,600
Papa, Bob and I have plans.

1250
02:13:29,810 --> 02:13:32,110
We want a place, just our own.

1251
02:13:35,150 --> 02:13:36,940
You crazy kids, you!

1252
02:13:39,320 --> 02:13:42,740
Can you imagine you'll ever have
anything like this? Like Reata?

1253
02:13:42,830 --> 02:13:45,660
Gosh, no, sir. We just want a little place.

1254
02:13:45,790 --> 02:13:50,330
Just a little place that'll allow us time
for experimentation and progress.

1255
02:13:50,420 --> 02:13:53,590
See, sir, big stuff is old stuff now.

1256
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:55,960
Big stuff is old stuff?.

1257
02:13:56,130 --> 02:14:00,590
Bob didn't mean to upset you.
He just wants to be honest, that's all.

1258
02:14:01,680 --> 02:14:05,510
We just want something little
that's our own. That's all.

1259
02:14:06,520 --> 02:14:07,980
Just ours.

1260
02:14:08,850 --> 02:14:10,310
You see, Dad?

1261
02:14:11,900 --> 02:14:14,020
Yeah, honey, I see.

1262
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:18,860
See you, Daddy.

1263
02:14:31,040 --> 02:14:33,710
Keeping it together all my life for them!

1264
02:14:34,500 --> 02:14:37,670
I battled mesquite, dust, and the wind...

1265
02:14:38,420 --> 02:14:40,050
to keep it this big.

1266
02:14:41,050 --> 02:14:42,340
And for who?

1267
02:14:43,430 --> 02:14:46,760
I might just as well give it back
to the dirty Comanches!

1268
02:14:47,100 --> 02:14:48,560
That's the Christmas spirit.

1269
02:14:48,680 --> 02:14:51,140
Give it all back to the poor old Indians.

1270
02:14:56,770 --> 02:14:59,860
Don't tell me, I know. You're Jett Rink.

1271
02:15:03,200 --> 02:15:04,410
You're Judy.

1272
02:15:04,530 --> 02:15:05,830
No, I'm Luz.

1273
02:15:10,200 --> 02:15:11,290
That I am.

1274
02:15:11,410 --> 02:15:12,710
Come on in.

1275
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:21,880
Dad's over at the bar.

1276
02:15:23,510 --> 02:15:26,350
Feel free, it's Christmas.
Everybody gets one.

1277
02:15:28,760 --> 02:15:30,060
Christmas?

1278
02:15:31,310 --> 02:15:35,060
I thought that was next week.
Somebody ought to have told me.

1279
02:15:37,020 --> 02:15:39,940
Christmas greetings
from Mr. Jetexas himself.

1280
02:15:53,750 --> 02:15:54,790
Sit down.

1281
02:16:00,550 --> 02:16:04,220
I guess Christmas is as good a day as any
to talk business.

1282
02:16:07,350 --> 02:16:08,600
Run along, Luz.

1283
02:16:09,760 --> 02:16:11,890
We've got business to talk about.

1284
02:16:12,020 --> 02:16:13,100
'Bye, now.

1285
02:16:15,480 --> 02:16:16,940
'Bye, Mr. Rink.

1286
02:16:18,810 --> 02:16:21,110
Everybody calls me Jett, honey.

1287
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:29,330
Bye-bye.

1288
02:16:38,380 --> 02:16:39,920
What's on your mind?

1289
02:16:40,040 --> 02:16:42,170
The country needs petroleum.

1290
02:16:43,010 --> 02:16:45,220
I'm going to Washington, Bick.

1291
02:16:45,800 --> 02:16:48,800
The reason I'm going
and the reason I'm here is oil.

1292
02:16:51,060 --> 02:16:52,350
I figured.

1293
02:16:53,980 --> 02:16:55,940
You want to talk a little business?

1294
02:16:56,600 --> 02:16:57,900
I'm ready.

1295
02:16:59,110 --> 02:17:02,440
It seems that every time we made a deal,
me and you...

1296
02:17:05,990 --> 02:17:08,360
it just turned out pretty lucky...

1297
02:17:09,700 --> 02:17:10,990
for somebody.

1298
02:17:46,740 --> 02:17:50,490
All this oil around here hasn't made
a lot of difference.

1299
02:17:51,530 --> 02:17:54,540
We live pretty much like we always have
here in Reata.

1300
02:17:55,620 --> 02:17:57,580
Just like we Benedicts found it.

1301
02:17:59,580 --> 02:18:03,710
The Lord was good to you, to set
the swimming pool in your own front yard.

1302
02:18:07,010 --> 02:18:08,630
Hey, come on in.

1303
02:18:09,590 --> 02:18:11,050
Not now, Luz.

1304
02:18:16,310 --> 02:18:18,680
It's good for the young folks.

1305
02:18:19,810 --> 02:18:22,810
We'd have made improvements
around here, oil or no oil.

1306
02:18:23,610 --> 02:18:27,440
But that 27.5 percent tax exemption
on oil helped, didn't it?

1307
02:18:29,820 --> 02:18:32,320
Bale, I'll tell you what old Pinky thinks.

1308
02:18:32,450 --> 02:18:33,200
What?

1309
02:18:33,280 --> 02:18:37,750
That oil tax exemption is the best thing
to hit Texas since we whooped Geronimo.

1310
02:18:46,170 --> 02:18:49,340
One of the finest laws ever passed
in Washington.

1311
02:18:50,340 --> 02:18:52,720
And all joking aside, Bick...

1312
02:18:53,090 --> 02:18:56,180
we're not adverse to accepting
a share of the credit for it.

1313
02:18:56,310 --> 02:18:57,560
Not at all.

1314
02:18:58,100 --> 02:19:02,400
How about an exemption for depreciation
of first-class brains, Senator?

1315
02:19:02,690 --> 02:19:04,150
Whose? Yours?

1316
02:19:04,730 --> 02:19:09,190
My father's, for instance. He spent his life
saving other people's lives.

1317
02:19:10,190 --> 02:19:12,660
How about some tax exemption there?

1318
02:19:18,120 --> 02:19:21,540
Leslie has always been a real sharp talker,
ain't she?

1319
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:25,840
Fair enough, Judge. You've always been
smooth enough for two.

1320
02:19:27,210 --> 02:19:30,920
" Do you take each other
for better or for worse...

1321
02:19:32,130 --> 02:19:34,260
" for richer or for poorer...

1322
02:19:35,140 --> 02:19:38,140
" in sickness and in health, until death?

1323
02:19:42,180 --> 02:19:45,520
" Jordan Benedict, wilt thou take...

1324
02:19:46,190 --> 02:19:48,230
" Juana Villalobos here present...

1325
02:19:49,150 --> 02:19:53,700
" for your lawful wife, according to
the rite of our Holy Mother the Church?"

1326
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:56,200
I will.

1327
02:19:57,490 --> 02:20:00,580
" Juana Villalobos, wilt thou take...

1328
02:20:01,620 --> 02:20:03,830
" Jordan Benedict here present...

1329
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:08,710
" for your lawful husband, according to
the rite of our Holy Mother the Church?"

1330
02:20:10,630 --> 02:20:11,630
I will.

1331
02:20:12,670 --> 02:20:14,970
Join your hands and kneel down.

1332
02:22:20,970 --> 02:22:22,600
What did they say?

1333
02:22:28,480 --> 02:22:30,100
<i>Friends and neighbors...</i>

1334
02:22:31,480 --> 02:22:33,440
<i>l want you all to meet my wife.</i>

1335
02:22:35,230 --> 02:22:36,860
<i>Mrs. Jordan Benedict III.</i>

1336
02:22:38,740 --> 02:22:39,820
Congratulations!

1337
02:23:57,650 --> 02:24:00,480
He was the first Reata baby I ever saw.

1338
02:24:02,240 --> 02:24:04,740
I remember it as if it were yesterday.

1339
02:24:07,330 --> 02:24:08,780
He had a fever.

1340
02:24:10,660 --> 02:24:13,830
I didn't think he was going
to live the day out.

1341
02:25:17,230 --> 02:25:22,190
On behalf of the U.S. Army, I am proud
to present to you the flag of our nation...

1342
02:25:22,730 --> 02:25:25,570
which your son defended so gallantly.

1343
02:27:42,710 --> 02:27:45,210
Everyone in the world's gonna be there.

1344
02:27:46,250 --> 02:27:49,260
I'm gonna fly up to Dallas,
and I'm going to Neiman's.

1345
02:27:49,630 --> 02:27:53,430
I'll buy myself
a starlight-white evening dress.

1346
02:27:54,050 --> 02:27:57,050
Very plain and simple and deadly.

1347
02:27:58,260 --> 02:28:00,430
Before you get so elaborate and simple...

1348
02:28:00,520 --> 02:28:02,940
you'd better hear
what your father has to say.

1349
02:28:03,060 --> 02:28:05,400
We're certainly going. I promised Jett.

1350
02:28:06,610 --> 02:28:09,690
Jett! What are you talking about?

1351
02:28:10,280 --> 02:28:14,910
He likes me. He likes my family, too.
He's always talking about you.

1352
02:28:16,820 --> 02:28:18,830
My dear, darling Luz...

1353
02:28:19,290 --> 02:28:23,370
if I didn't know you had a level Benedict
head on those immature shoulders...

1354
02:28:23,460 --> 02:28:25,630
I'd prescribe a good spanking.

1355
02:28:25,960 --> 02:28:29,000
He's dreamy. Ask the Snythe girls.

1356
02:28:29,300 --> 02:28:30,550
Ask anyone.

1357
02:28:30,670 --> 02:28:32,670
He's just a rough diamond.

1358
02:28:32,800 --> 02:28:37,050
He's a rough rhinestone.
He's old enough to be your father.

1359
02:28:38,760 --> 02:28:40,930
What are you six evil men up to now?

1360
02:28:41,020 --> 02:28:43,560
Honey, it's a coronation.

1361
02:28:44,190 --> 02:28:46,480
Jett plans to get himself crowned king.

1362
02:28:46,560 --> 02:28:49,070
You got to have $10 million
to be on the guest list.

1363
02:28:49,150 --> 02:28:51,940
The most important people
in the country will be there.

1364
02:28:52,030 --> 02:28:53,740
Coast-to-coast broadcast.

1365
02:28:53,820 --> 02:28:55,990
Jett's gonna make a magnificent speech.

1366
02:28:56,070 --> 02:28:57,030
I know.

1367
02:28:57,990 --> 02:28:59,990
I'm going to write it for him.

1368
02:29:00,080 --> 02:29:02,330
It'll be heard across the nation
by everyone.

1369
02:29:02,410 --> 02:29:05,370
Eliminating one. That's me.

1370
02:29:07,170 --> 02:29:11,670
If you people stay away, Leslie, you'll be
the only folks in Texas who ain't there.

1371
02:29:11,750 --> 02:29:13,760
You'll be roped in with the herd.

1372
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:18,140
You'll be putting on your pink shoes and
dancing to Jett's fiddles like the rest of us.

1373
02:29:18,220 --> 02:29:20,510
If we go then we'll do it right.

1374
02:29:20,600 --> 02:29:25,390
We're oil rich, like the rest of them.
We'll go like the rest of them! Only better.

1375
02:29:25,480 --> 02:29:27,270
Now you're talking like my father.

1376
02:29:27,350 --> 02:29:28,980
The old Benedict spirit.

1377
02:29:29,060 --> 02:29:31,270
You set up one of your great weekends.

1378
02:29:31,360 --> 02:29:33,610
Invite everybody.
We'll take them all with us.

1379
02:29:33,690 --> 02:29:37,030
We'll show that so-and-so
who's top people around here.

1380
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:39,450
I'll even buy the four-engine Douglas.

1381
02:29:39,740 --> 02:29:42,080
Fly in some orchids from Hawaii.

1382
02:29:43,700 --> 02:29:47,330
We'll fly in low and shake the tiles
off that hotel roof.

1383
02:30:48,270 --> 02:30:49,940
There's Lola Lane!

1384
02:30:50,020 --> 02:30:52,310
I bet even Hollywood isn't this exciting.

1385
02:30:52,400 --> 02:30:54,940
-Isn't this something?
-It's perfectly fabulous!

1386
02:30:55,020 --> 02:30:57,490
Jett always tries to do things
in a bigger way...

1387
02:30:57,570 --> 02:30:59,700
and spend more money than anybody else.

1388
02:30:59,780 --> 02:31:01,280
Really? What does he do?

1389
02:31:01,780 --> 02:31:04,620
To some folks, he's just
a no-good wildcatting so-and-so.

1390
02:31:23,720 --> 02:31:24,720
There he is.

1391
02:31:31,640 --> 02:31:33,650
There's the emperor himself.

1392
02:31:41,490 --> 02:31:44,990
Isn't this terrific?
Look at Luz, she's queen of the parade.

1393
02:31:45,570 --> 02:31:47,330
You didn't tell me.

1394
02:31:51,750 --> 02:31:53,750
Did you know about this, Leslie?

1395
02:31:55,670 --> 02:31:56,670
No, I didn't.

1396
02:32:03,180 --> 02:32:06,680
My daughter, queen of Jett Rink Day!
What is this?

1397
02:32:08,180 --> 02:32:09,850
I don't know, Jordan.

1398
02:32:11,270 --> 02:32:14,350
She's done things before I haven't
gone along with, but this....

1399
02:32:14,440 --> 02:32:16,310
She's never been sneaky.

1400
02:32:16,480 --> 02:32:19,650
It's not exactly sneaky,
appearing in a parade.

1401
02:32:19,730 --> 02:32:21,320
Don't try to be funny.

1402
02:32:21,690 --> 02:32:24,410
I'm not. I'm just as upset as you are.

1403
02:32:25,450 --> 02:32:29,290
But Luz is intelligent enough
not to be imposed on by him or anyone.

1404
02:32:29,540 --> 02:32:30,870
Give me the desk.

1405
02:32:31,870 --> 02:32:33,040
It's Bick Benedict.

1406
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:35,580
Did my daughter
Luz Benedict come in yet?

1407
02:32:36,290 --> 02:32:39,210
Get this. As soon as she comes in,
have her call me.

1408
02:33:17,580 --> 02:33:19,750
You know what I think I'll do?

1409
02:33:22,210 --> 02:33:24,720
I'm going to keep it just like this.

1410
02:33:27,260 --> 02:33:30,100
I'll keep all those people, send them home.

1411
02:33:33,100 --> 02:33:35,060
I'm not even gonna open up this place.

1412
02:33:38,350 --> 02:33:41,520
Some girls might like a hotel
all to themselves.

1413
02:33:42,570 --> 02:33:45,570
Me, I like company, Jett.
I like lots of people.

1414
02:33:48,280 --> 02:33:49,490
All right.

1415
02:33:50,830 --> 02:33:54,540
You want lots of people?
I don't see any problem there.

1416
02:33:59,290 --> 02:34:03,590
If there's anything you want,
just say it, and you've got it.

1417
02:34:07,380 --> 02:34:09,590
All right, I'd like a Coke.

1418
02:34:13,640 --> 02:34:16,730
No, that's impossible.
That's just impossible.

1419
02:34:17,600 --> 02:34:21,440
You know as well as I do, Cokes are taboo.
All soft drinks.

1420
02:34:24,320 --> 02:34:25,940
You make the rules.

1421
02:34:31,320 --> 02:34:33,990
You like things your own way, don't you?

1422
02:34:35,040 --> 02:34:37,040
Let me ask you something.

1423
02:34:38,120 --> 02:34:42,630
Do you like things your way?
Not many people have things their way.

1424
02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:46,590
No, I don't get them my way very often.

1425
02:34:50,800 --> 02:34:53,800
And you won't either,
until you get married...

1426
02:34:56,430 --> 02:34:59,310
and get your man
to give you what you want.

1427
02:34:59,390 --> 02:35:00,350
So?

1428
02:35:01,730 --> 02:35:05,070
So if I was you,
I'd start thinking about getting married.

1429
02:35:06,400 --> 02:35:08,280
You know, that's an idea.

1430
02:35:15,700 --> 02:35:18,540
You looked like a queen
in that parade today.

1431
02:35:19,660 --> 02:35:21,170
That was my job.

1432
02:35:32,050 --> 02:35:33,890
It's just what you are.

1433
02:35:34,600 --> 02:35:36,560
Luz Benedict ll.

1434
02:35:39,140 --> 02:35:43,100
You could be the head lady
of this part of the whole country...

1435
02:35:44,230 --> 02:35:47,440
if you wanted to.
If you married the right man.

1436
02:35:48,990 --> 02:35:50,490
That's a sweet idea.

1437
02:35:52,910 --> 02:35:55,570
Why don't I just announce it tonight...

1438
02:35:55,870 --> 02:35:59,040
with all them thousands
of people listening?

1439
02:36:01,540 --> 02:36:03,000
The whole of Texas.

1440
02:36:05,380 --> 02:36:07,710
Wouldn't that blow the roof off?.

1441
02:36:12,470 --> 02:36:14,470
Jett, tell me something.

1442
02:36:18,810 --> 02:36:20,350
Is this a proposal?

1443
02:36:20,430 --> 02:36:22,060
Does it sound like one?

1444
02:36:24,940 --> 02:36:27,270
After a fashion, but not quite.

1445
02:36:31,360 --> 02:36:34,360
You want me to say something
you can laugh at?

1446
02:36:36,780 --> 02:36:37,780
No.

1447
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,660
I just think you're a wonderful girl.

1448
02:36:45,120 --> 02:36:47,590
And I do think you're beautiful.

1449
02:36:51,510 --> 02:36:55,590
You're fascinating to me.
I've always been looking for...

1450
02:36:56,430 --> 02:36:57,890
a girl like you.

1451
02:37:10,020 --> 02:37:12,860
Sure would blow the roof off, wouldn't it?

1452
02:37:17,160 --> 02:37:19,490
You've got a long way to go tonight.

1453
02:37:25,040 --> 02:37:27,710
I'm very flattered. Any girl would be.

1454
02:37:33,760 --> 02:37:35,590
You be a good boy now.

1455
02:37:37,260 --> 02:37:38,680
I'll see you later.

1456
02:38:43,280 --> 02:38:46,250
I hope this storm doesn't louse up
your party.

1457
02:38:46,330 --> 02:38:50,290
A slip-up, boy. I just forgot
to order the right kind of weather!

1458
02:38:50,790 --> 02:38:52,130
I heard a twister hit Waco.

1459
02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:13,230
What's wrong with you?
Can't you talk United States?

1460
02:39:13,310 --> 02:39:14,820
You're talking to my wife.

1461
02:39:15,480 --> 02:39:18,820
I'm Jordan Benedict,
if that means anything to you.

1462
02:39:19,240 --> 02:39:21,200
I'm just following orders.

1463
02:39:21,530 --> 02:39:24,740
Mr. Rink said he'd have my neck
if I let any of the wrong people in.

1464
02:39:33,040 --> 02:39:36,420
You Benedicts are all close together.
They've got the Coronado suite.

1465
02:39:36,500 --> 02:39:37,960
You're in the Filando suite.

1466
02:39:38,050 --> 02:39:40,840
I'm a mess. I must go to the beauty parlor.

1467
02:39:40,930 --> 02:39:42,930
Hurry before they close.

1468
02:39:43,220 --> 02:39:47,390
<i>Grand opening of the Jett Rink Airport
and Emperador Hotel...</i>

1469
02:39:47,850 --> 02:39:52,020
<i>is the latest milestone in the dramatic
life of this virile son of Texas.</i>

1470
02:39:54,770 --> 02:39:55,900
Howdy, everybody!

1471
02:39:59,610 --> 02:40:01,820
-It's time you got here.
-Where are the boys?

1472
02:40:01,900 --> 02:40:03,490
Where's Pinky, the old bat?

1473
02:40:04,450 --> 02:40:06,450
Filando suite for Mr. Benedict, please.

1474
02:40:07,370 --> 02:40:08,660
<i>Beauty salon.</i>

1475
02:40:08,740 --> 02:40:10,080
Can you take me?

1476
02:40:11,210 --> 02:40:13,170
<i>Yes, if you can come right along.</i>

1477
02:40:13,250 --> 02:40:15,330
Thank goodness. I'll be right in.

1478
02:40:15,420 --> 02:40:17,670
<i>-Who's calling, please?
-Mrs. Benedict.</i>

1479
02:40:18,050 --> 02:40:20,050
<i>Come on along, Mrs. Benedict.</i>

1480
02:40:20,130 --> 02:40:21,170
Thank you.

1481
02:40:23,630 --> 02:40:26,260
Keep everybody freshened up, will you?
We'll be quick.

1482
02:40:26,350 --> 02:40:29,810
We're anxious to see old Jett come out
in that suit.

1483
02:40:32,890 --> 02:40:36,440
Why couldn't they ride with us
like other people's kids do?

1484
02:40:36,520 --> 02:40:40,150
Luz had to fly her own plane
and Jordy and Juana had to drive.

1485
02:41:03,720 --> 02:41:05,220
Is anybody here?

1486
02:41:09,640 --> 02:41:11,220
We're all booked up.

1487
02:41:11,310 --> 02:41:13,810
I just called. I'm Mrs. Benedict.

1488
02:41:15,600 --> 02:41:17,610
I'm sorry, but we're busy.

1489
02:41:18,770 --> 02:41:20,610
I'll wait a little.

1490
02:41:28,370 --> 02:41:31,240
They're driving. It takes time.

1491
02:41:31,370 --> 02:41:33,370
I know it takes time.

1492
02:41:34,330 --> 02:41:36,420
I made the trip myself 500 times.

1493
02:41:39,630 --> 02:41:41,800
But don't worry about the children.

1494
02:41:41,880 --> 02:41:44,880
Their behavior is odd,
but their manners are beautiful.

1495
02:41:44,970 --> 02:41:46,470
Listen here, boy!

1496
02:41:46,550 --> 02:41:48,510
I've taken enough from you!

1497
02:41:48,680 --> 02:41:50,550
I didn't want to come here!

1498
02:41:50,640 --> 02:41:53,560
I wouldn't be here unless you let them
bully you into it.

1499
02:41:53,640 --> 02:41:56,140
Now, for heaven's sake,
let's make the best of it.

1500
02:41:56,230 --> 02:42:00,480
Cool down, go on with your shaving, finish
dressing, and I'll go downstairs with you!

1501
02:42:00,560 --> 02:42:02,650
Otherwise, you can go alone!

1502
02:42:04,150 --> 02:42:05,490
You know, honey...

1503
02:42:06,860 --> 02:42:09,280
you're awful cute when you get riled.

1504
02:42:17,250 --> 02:42:20,920
Hurry on in there.
Your ma and pa are sure having a battle.

1505
02:42:25,130 --> 02:42:26,220
Hello, honey.

1506
02:42:26,300 --> 02:42:27,590
Where have you been?

1507
02:42:27,720 --> 02:42:29,550
We got tied up in traffic.

1508
02:42:29,640 --> 02:42:30,720
Where's Juana?

1509
02:42:30,800 --> 02:42:33,100
She's in the beauty parlor.

1510
02:42:34,430 --> 02:42:36,640
Hello, sweetheart.

1511
02:42:37,640 --> 02:42:39,980
He's all right. He just didn't get his nap.

1512
02:42:41,730 --> 02:42:43,770
How's my child?

1513
02:42:44,860 --> 02:42:46,940
Is that Judy crying?

1514
02:43:07,550 --> 02:43:08,970
I hope I'm not too late.

1515
02:43:09,050 --> 02:43:10,510
No. Come right in.

1516
02:43:34,160 --> 02:43:35,160
Yeah?

1517
02:43:35,660 --> 02:43:36,990
Hello, Juana.

1518
02:43:37,290 --> 02:43:39,790
Yeah, he's here. Jordy, it's for you.

1519
02:43:45,170 --> 02:43:46,380
Yes, dear?

1520
02:43:50,680 --> 02:43:53,510
Stay right there, honey.
I'm coming right down.

1521
02:43:58,020 --> 02:44:00,850
Don't you folks wait on us, we'll catch up.

1522
02:44:02,230 --> 02:44:03,850
Son, you're way behind.

1523
02:44:06,940 --> 02:44:09,440
Howdy, everybody, look what we found.

1524
02:44:16,200 --> 02:44:17,540
There you are.

1525
02:44:18,740 --> 02:44:20,450
We were getting worried.

1526
02:44:21,250 --> 02:44:23,370
You'd better get dressed, Jett.

1527
02:44:25,630 --> 02:44:28,630
You wanted me to go over
the speech with you, too.

1528
02:44:29,340 --> 02:44:31,170
Come on, we'd better hurry.

1529
02:44:33,630 --> 02:44:37,140
I'm sorry, but it happens to be
Mr. Jett Rink's orders, himself.

1530
02:44:37,560 --> 02:44:39,060
I'm just working here.

1531
02:44:39,350 --> 02:44:41,850
Everybody's orders. Same all over town.

1532
02:44:42,140 --> 02:44:45,980
The young lady should have gone
to a place where they do her people.

1533
02:44:59,490 --> 02:45:01,830
If it isn't the queen herself!

1534
02:45:02,410 --> 02:45:04,250
-Are you having fun?
-We're making out.

1535
02:45:04,330 --> 02:45:06,290
-How are you doing?
-Good.

1536
02:45:06,880 --> 02:45:08,710
Where are Mom and Dad?

1537
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:10,670
Don't trifle with your luck.

1538
02:45:12,420 --> 02:45:13,590
There you are.

1539
02:45:14,220 --> 02:45:16,390
You wanted to talk to me, Dad?

1540
02:45:16,970 --> 02:45:20,350
If you can spare me a moment,
I'd like to talk to you, young lady.

1541
02:45:20,430 --> 02:45:21,770
Dad, must we now?

1542
02:45:21,930 --> 02:45:25,100
Jordan, we must hurry to be in time
for the grand entrance.

1543
02:45:25,190 --> 02:45:27,860
Luz, darling, you look just beautiful!

1544
02:45:28,900 --> 02:45:32,070
Help me round everybody up.
I'm sorry I'm so late.

1545
02:45:32,440 --> 02:45:34,280
All right, people....

1546
02:46:14,110 --> 02:46:16,320
Did some of you boys change this around?

1547
02:46:17,610 --> 02:46:21,450
We haven't changed a single comma.
Changes tend to throw you.

1548
02:46:22,450 --> 02:46:26,790
" Columbus discovered only the shell
of this country. Agassiz came...."

1549
02:46:33,960 --> 02:46:35,340
Where's Rink?

1550
02:46:35,550 --> 02:46:37,220
He went that way.

1551
02:46:52,230 --> 02:46:54,900
Looks like I just come in for a root beer.

1552
02:46:55,360 --> 02:46:58,360
That, my friend, is a Texas range.

1553
02:47:15,880 --> 02:47:17,760
What're you doing sitting up there?

1554
02:47:17,840 --> 02:47:22,350
" You've heard of Paul Revere?"
The Texan said, " Paul Revere?

1555
02:47:23,050 --> 02:47:26,390
" Oh, yes. Ain't he the fellow
that had to ride for help?"

1556
02:47:32,980 --> 02:47:36,400
<i>In just a few moments, Mr. Rink himself...</i>

1557
02:47:36,900 --> 02:47:39,400
<i>will be here at the microphone.</i>

1558
02:47:39,490 --> 02:47:41,110
Come on, let's go.

1559
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,330
Jordy is looking for Jett Rink.

1560
02:47:51,580 --> 02:47:52,750
What?

1561
02:48:01,090 --> 02:48:05,550
Where we had our hair done. Jordy wants
to fight Jett because it was his orders.

1562
02:48:05,640 --> 02:48:08,770
On account of Juana. The girl said
they didn't take wetbacks.

1563
02:48:54,690 --> 02:48:56,810
Stay here, honey, I'll be right back.

1564
02:49:08,830 --> 02:49:11,040
You invited me here to insult my wife.

1565
02:49:12,370 --> 02:49:14,000
You're gonna answer for it!

1566
02:49:15,500 --> 02:49:17,840
Ain't you the one who married the squaw?

1567
02:49:18,500 --> 02:49:20,880
What's the matter, boy?
Not having a good time?

1568
02:49:20,960 --> 02:49:24,050
Get them up, Rink! Everybody knows
you got this coming to you!

1569
02:49:24,130 --> 02:49:25,470
Jordy, no!

1570
02:49:43,820 --> 02:49:47,820
You want it in front of everybody,
or you want to come outside?

1571
02:49:48,990 --> 02:49:52,750
I don't care much whether it's here
or outside...

1572
02:49:53,370 --> 02:49:57,330
so long as I get one punch
at that stuck-up face of yours.

1573
02:50:01,380 --> 02:50:03,340
Sit down.

1574
02:50:07,180 --> 02:50:08,300
Governor.

1575
02:50:08,760 --> 02:50:10,470
How are you this evening?

1576
02:50:11,510 --> 02:50:15,850
<i>And now, to introduce our guest of honor,
we hear from a man...</i>

1577
02:50:16,140 --> 02:50:20,820
<i>known from the rocky coast of Maine
to the Golden Gate in California.</i>

1578
02:50:21,400 --> 02:50:24,320
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, our own...</i>

1579
02:50:24,740 --> 02:50:26,780
<i>Senator Oliver Whiteside.</i>

1580
02:50:53,930 --> 02:50:55,270
Get them up.

1581
02:50:56,930 --> 02:50:59,650
You had this coming to you
for a long time.

1582
02:51:05,440 --> 02:51:07,780
You'll get what you gave my boy.

1583
02:51:08,780 --> 02:51:09,780
Get them up.

1584
02:51:09,860 --> 02:51:10,950
Get them up!

1585
02:51:13,280 --> 02:51:15,290
<i>...proud, friendly...</i>

1586
02:51:15,790 --> 02:51:18,870
<i>warm-hearted, successful.</i>

1587
02:51:19,620 --> 02:51:22,960
<i>Yes, successful l am sure....</i>

1588
02:51:29,930 --> 02:51:32,090
You ain't even worth hitting.

1589
02:51:36,640 --> 02:51:38,770
You want to know something true?

1590
02:51:40,900 --> 02:51:42,310
You're all through.

1591
02:52:04,880 --> 02:52:08,010
<i>I'm going to ask you
to come with me tonight...</i>

1592
02:52:08,170 --> 02:52:12,510
<i>as l turn back the pages
in my book of happy memories...</i>

1593
02:52:12,970 --> 02:52:16,510
<i>and l recall the first time
l saw young Jett Rink.</i>

1594
02:52:16,600 --> 02:52:19,020
-Where's the boy?
-Juana took Jordy upstairs.

1595
02:52:19,140 --> 02:52:20,430
Let's get out of here.

1596
02:52:20,520 --> 02:52:21,850
I'll go get Luz.

1597
02:52:26,520 --> 02:52:28,360
Come on, Luz. We're leaving.

1598
02:52:29,110 --> 02:52:30,990
Excuse me, please.

1599
02:52:35,410 --> 02:52:37,540
<i>The years passed quickly...</i>

1600
02:52:38,040 --> 02:52:40,370
<i>as the years have a way of doing.</i>

1601
02:52:40,450 --> 02:52:42,040
<i>And now l see Jett Rink...</i>

1602
02:52:47,920 --> 02:52:52,300
<i>afraid of neither opposition
nor hard work...</i>

1603
02:52:52,720 --> 02:52:55,550
<i>his eyes set on the far distant...</i>

1604
02:52:55,640 --> 02:52:58,930
<i>goal toward which he's ever working...</i>

1605
02:52:59,390 --> 02:53:01,680
<i>planning, striving.</i>

1606
02:53:04,980 --> 02:53:07,650
<i>And now we come to Jett Rink, the man.</i>

1607
02:53:08,820 --> 02:53:11,320
<i>Texas has been kind to Jett Rink.</i>

1608
02:53:11,990 --> 02:53:15,620
<i>And Jett, never forgetting this kindness...</i>

1609
02:53:16,070 --> 02:53:18,740
<i>is ever ready to devote his resources...</i>

1610
02:53:19,200 --> 02:53:22,830
<i>to the greater glory of the state
which reared him...</i>

1611
02:53:22,910 --> 02:53:26,080
<i>which, in turn,
does honor to him tonight...</i>

1612
02:53:26,540 --> 02:53:30,000
<i>in this great gathering here present.</i>

1613
02:53:31,760 --> 02:53:34,130
<i>And now, my friends, here...</i>

1614
02:53:34,430 --> 02:53:39,060
<i>and to the thousands of you
listening across the nation...</i>

1615
02:53:39,180 --> 02:53:40,720
<i>l have the privilege, yes...</i>

1616
02:53:43,100 --> 02:53:48,690
<i>l have the great honor to introduce
a legend in his own time...</i>

1617
02:53:49,320 --> 02:53:50,940
<i>a great Texan...</i>

1618
02:53:51,400 --> 02:53:53,990
<i>an outstanding American!</i>

1619
02:53:54,400 --> 02:53:57,570
<i>Yes, my friends, a man!</i>

1620
02:53:58,120 --> 02:54:01,080
<i>l give to you Jett Rink!</i>

1621
02:54:35,320 --> 02:54:37,150
You can count on me.

1622
02:54:41,580 --> 02:54:43,370
All right, goodbye.

1623
02:54:45,160 --> 02:54:46,290
How bad?

1624
02:54:46,710 --> 02:54:48,710
It hit pretty hard in Vientecito.

1625
02:54:49,290 --> 02:54:53,550
Dr. Guerra set up an auxiliary hospital.
He needs help. I've got to go there.

1626
02:54:54,050 --> 02:54:57,430
You'll make better time
if you wait till first light and fly.

1627
02:54:57,680 --> 02:55:00,550
I hate to spend the night under Jett's roof.

1628
02:55:00,890 --> 02:55:05,730
Me, too. If we weren't transporting
a circus, we'd all hightail it out of here.

1629
02:55:22,240 --> 02:55:24,950
I hope she doesn't let this
upset her too much.

1630
02:55:25,580 --> 02:55:27,580
This business tonight...

1631
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:33,420
it's just one of those things.
The best thing to do is forget about it.

1632
02:55:34,380 --> 02:55:37,720
Go ahead and forget it.
Me, I'm going to remember it!

1633
02:55:39,260 --> 02:55:40,760
Now look, Jordy.

1634
02:55:41,720 --> 02:55:43,010
Take it easy.

1635
02:55:43,970 --> 02:55:47,560
We've had just about enough excitement
around here for one night.

1636
02:55:48,230 --> 02:55:49,600
Yeah, I guess so.

1637
02:55:53,900 --> 02:55:57,070
You've always had a mind of your own
and used it.

1638
02:55:58,030 --> 02:56:00,360
You've done things your own way.

1639
02:56:04,120 --> 02:56:07,950
You knew what you were doing
when you married in that direction.

1640
02:56:10,290 --> 02:56:14,290
I told you myself the morning
after you broke the news, remember?

1641
02:56:15,750 --> 02:56:19,760
I told you then that I knew
Juana was a mighty fine little gal...

1642
02:56:21,340 --> 02:56:24,930
but that marrying her was asking
for trouble. Remember?

1643
02:56:25,350 --> 02:56:26,810
I told you that.

1644
02:56:28,680 --> 02:56:32,480
Lots of folks in these parts
get pretty jumpy about that sort of thing.

1645
02:56:32,560 --> 02:56:33,770
Jett's only one of them.

1646
02:56:33,850 --> 02:56:37,980
I know those people. We've run
into this before. We're doing fine.

1647
02:56:40,360 --> 02:56:44,030
I'm concerned it has to do with the people
that ought to know better.

1648
02:56:48,120 --> 02:56:49,620
Like my own father.

1649
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:55,840
Just the simple truth. That's you.
That's the way you think.

1650
02:56:56,750 --> 02:57:01,220
I don't care about Jett Rink,
but you, Papa, that's different.

1651
02:57:01,670 --> 02:57:03,510
Now you look here, Jordy!

1652
02:57:04,220 --> 02:57:06,220
You can't talk to me like that.

1653
02:57:07,510 --> 02:57:09,220
No man can!

1654
02:57:11,680 --> 02:57:15,350
I'm a fair man. I've been fair all my life,
with everybody!

1655
02:57:16,150 --> 02:57:20,190
And you, my own son,
can't tell me that I'm not a fair man!

1656
02:57:24,360 --> 02:57:25,570
Look, Jordy...

1657
02:57:26,740 --> 02:57:29,990
there's ways of living,
and there's ways of doing things...

1658
02:57:30,120 --> 02:57:33,370
that folks abide by when they want
to live right and happily...

1659
02:57:33,460 --> 02:57:35,500
in the comfort of their own people.

1660
02:57:35,920 --> 02:57:39,090
I always say that Juana is
a mighty fine gal, but--

1661
02:57:39,170 --> 02:57:42,210
Don't sit there and prove what I say!
I don't like to hear it!

1662
02:57:42,760 --> 02:57:44,760
You're not being fair!

1663
02:57:46,390 --> 02:57:49,220
When that ruckus started,
who went after Rink?

1664
02:57:49,720 --> 02:57:51,560
Your old man.

1665
02:57:51,850 --> 02:57:54,730
-Who took him to account? Your old man.
-And why?

1666
02:57:55,730 --> 02:57:56,900
Because of my wife?

1667
02:57:56,980 --> 02:57:58,060
-Yes!
-No!

1668
02:57:58,400 --> 02:58:01,110
Because your son, Jordan Benedict...

1669
02:58:01,230 --> 02:58:04,360
descendant of the long, proud line
of Reata...

1670
02:58:04,450 --> 02:58:08,570
got knocked flat on his back
in front of all of Texas. That's why!

1671
02:58:25,760 --> 02:58:28,590
Forget it. Don't worry yourself about it.

1672
02:58:37,770 --> 02:58:42,400
Mom, you made a mistake when you got
yourself mixed up with us rowdy Texans.

1673
02:58:43,900 --> 02:58:48,610
I'm shocked at you! I'm shocked
at all of us! I'm just so ashamed!

1674
02:58:49,160 --> 02:58:53,450
I'll never forget the sight of my brother
barging into the grand ballroom...

1675
02:58:53,540 --> 02:58:58,120
with all of our friends, disgracing us!
Then my father made it a bigger brawl!

1676
02:58:58,210 --> 02:59:00,630
How can I face people again?

1677
02:59:00,710 --> 02:59:03,130
If you keep seeing Jett,
you won't have to face me.

1678
02:59:03,210 --> 02:59:04,260
Children!

1679
02:59:04,670 --> 02:59:06,630
How about that anyway, Mom?

1680
02:59:06,720 --> 02:59:08,470
I haven't been asked.

1681
02:59:08,550 --> 02:59:12,050
It seems that my family
just can't tolerate his success.

1682
02:59:12,350 --> 02:59:13,680
My darling, Luz.

1683
02:59:13,850 --> 02:59:17,020
Tonight meant a lot to Jett. Really. I know.

1684
02:59:18,640 --> 02:59:22,320
If I only knew how to apologize to him,
I'd go to him now.

1685
02:59:24,150 --> 02:59:26,650
But I can't face all those people.

1686
02:59:27,610 --> 02:59:29,780
The party is over. They've all gone home.

1687
02:59:31,370 --> 02:59:34,040
He passed out like a light
in front of the whole crowd.

1688
02:59:34,120 --> 02:59:35,290
Oh, no!

1689
02:59:35,700 --> 02:59:37,460
That's what we heard, Luz.

1690
02:59:39,250 --> 02:59:41,460
He must have been ill.

1691
02:59:42,340 --> 02:59:44,170
Weak with shame or something.

1692
02:59:44,590 --> 02:59:47,420
He was plain drunk, if you'll forgive me.

1693
02:59:48,510 --> 02:59:50,260
I don't believe you.

1694
02:59:52,010 --> 02:59:55,180
The party broke up early,
but not a minute too soon.

1695
03:00:01,850 --> 03:00:04,070
Give me Mr. Rink's penthouse, please.

1696
03:00:04,150 --> 03:00:07,820
You're not going up there,
even if I have to sit on you!

1697
03:00:09,110 --> 03:00:11,820
It's important. Do you know where he is?

1698
03:00:11,910 --> 03:00:14,870
Luz, it's not like you
to make a fool of yourself.

1699
03:00:16,370 --> 03:00:19,870
I know where he is, honey.
Come along with Uncle Bawley.

1700
03:00:22,120 --> 03:00:24,630
All right, Luz. If you must go.

1701
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:28,170
I must.

1702
03:00:30,590 --> 03:00:33,760
I've always held a strange power
over your mother.

1703
03:00:41,440 --> 03:00:43,100
I'm sorry, Mother.

1704
03:00:54,370 --> 03:00:58,200
What do you say, doll face?
About ready to come along with me?

1705
03:01:01,080 --> 03:01:02,710
It's time we hit the hay.

1706
03:01:08,210 --> 03:01:09,380
I give up.

1707
03:01:14,470 --> 03:01:15,760
Can we go to work now?

1708
03:01:15,850 --> 03:01:19,350
Leave him alone.
He owns the place, let him enjoy it.

1709
03:01:19,430 --> 03:01:20,600
Shut up.

1710
03:01:21,640 --> 03:01:22,810
Shut up!

1711
03:01:41,660 --> 03:01:44,670
Ladies and gentlemen
and distinguished guests.

1712
03:01:48,790 --> 03:01:51,460
I just want to count the blessings...

1713
03:01:53,590 --> 03:01:57,260
that this great domain
has bestowed upon her humble son.

1714
03:01:59,810 --> 03:02:01,100
My friends...

1715
03:02:03,810 --> 03:02:05,730
this is a man.

1716
03:02:12,780 --> 03:02:14,450
Old Mother Texas!

1717
03:02:16,240 --> 03:02:18,240
What did she give to me?

1718
03:02:18,990 --> 03:02:21,490
Not a goddamn thing.

1719
03:02:21,990 --> 03:02:25,870
You've got to work and sweat
and steal it from her.

1720
03:02:28,630 --> 03:02:33,260
But I got mine right out of the ground.

1721
03:02:36,470 --> 03:02:37,970
Poor Jett...

1722
03:02:40,550 --> 03:02:42,680
fighting for what's good.

1723
03:02:43,390 --> 03:02:44,640
Flunky!

1724
03:02:46,140 --> 03:02:48,560
Flunky for Bick Benedict...

1725
03:02:50,020 --> 03:02:51,230
her husband.

1726
03:02:55,860 --> 03:02:57,240
Poor Jett!

1727
03:03:04,620 --> 03:03:06,460
Poor pretty Leslie!

1728
03:03:08,620 --> 03:03:09,790
Pretty Leslie....

1729
03:03:12,090 --> 03:03:16,420
Pretty Leslie.
Wonderful, beautiful girl bride!

1730
03:03:19,090 --> 03:03:20,430
Poor boy.

1731
03:03:21,430 --> 03:03:22,470
Rich....

1732
03:03:23,180 --> 03:03:24,770
Rich Mrs. Benedict.

1733
03:03:28,890 --> 03:03:30,560
She's beautiful.

1734
03:03:32,020 --> 03:03:33,230
Lovely.

1735
03:03:34,030 --> 03:03:35,610
The woman a man wants.

1736
03:03:36,820 --> 03:03:39,160
A woman a man has got to have, too!

1737
03:04:03,050 --> 03:04:05,010
Thank you, Uncle Bawley.

1738
03:04:07,730 --> 03:04:08,980
Governor...

1739
03:04:13,310 --> 03:04:15,360
you know what you can do?

1740
03:04:53,350 --> 03:04:55,360
As soon as it lands, I'll sell it.

1741
03:04:55,690 --> 03:04:56,360
Good.

1742
03:04:56,440 --> 03:04:57,650
This is for me, boy.

1743
03:04:57,730 --> 03:04:58,940
The simple life.

1744
03:04:59,030 --> 03:05:01,150
No more of this highflying nonsense.

1745
03:05:31,560 --> 03:05:34,850
Juana, how does a hamburger
and a piece of pie sound to you?

1746
03:05:34,940 --> 03:05:36,110
Sounds very good.

1747
03:05:37,230 --> 03:05:39,570
No more of this highfalutin stuff.

1748
03:05:39,690 --> 03:05:42,400
Let's stop at this drive-in
and have us some chicken.

1749
03:05:42,490 --> 03:05:44,320
Then we can eat it with our fingers.

1750
03:06:36,120 --> 03:06:39,960
Nice place you have here. I've been
intending to stop every time I drove by.

1751
03:06:40,040 --> 03:06:41,210
Thank you.

1752
03:06:41,300 --> 03:06:43,880
What do you recommend?
How is the fried chicken?

1753
03:06:43,970 --> 03:06:46,510
Little Jordy wants ice cream, Grandpa.

1754
03:06:48,090 --> 03:06:49,140
Grandpa?

1755
03:06:51,060 --> 03:06:52,890
Ice cream it shall be.

1756
03:06:54,140 --> 03:06:56,310
Give the little fellow some ice cream.

1757
03:06:56,480 --> 03:06:58,150
Ice cream?

1758
03:06:58,230 --> 03:07:00,650
I thought that kid would want a tamale.

1759
03:07:11,740 --> 03:07:13,740
Give them what they want.

1760
03:07:30,510 --> 03:07:32,720
What do you say? Is this all right?

1761
03:07:33,680 --> 03:07:35,020
It's good.

1762
03:07:36,350 --> 03:07:39,020
After all that fancy food and high living.

1763
03:07:39,350 --> 03:07:40,690
This is the life.

1764
03:07:57,830 --> 03:07:59,000
Hey, you.

1765
03:08:02,340 --> 03:08:06,050
The plane should arrive in Benedict
around 1 :30.

1766
03:08:10,050 --> 03:08:12,050
You're in the wrong place.

1767
03:08:12,260 --> 03:08:14,600
Come on, let's get out of here.

1768
03:08:16,180 --> 03:08:17,980
Your money is no good here.

1769
03:08:19,440 --> 03:08:21,100
Come on, let's go.

1770
03:08:22,980 --> 03:08:24,070
You, too.

1771
03:08:24,190 --> 03:08:25,570
Hold on a minute.

1772
03:08:33,160 --> 03:08:34,990
Yes, what do you want?

1773
03:08:36,910 --> 03:08:41,920
Look here, Sarge. I'd sure appreciate it
if you were more polite to these people.

1774
03:08:43,080 --> 03:08:44,590
You would, eh?

1775
03:08:45,500 --> 03:08:48,670
I'm Bick Benedict.
Your neighbor, you might say.

1776
03:08:49,340 --> 03:08:52,050
Does that give you special privileges?

1777
03:08:52,430 --> 03:08:56,890
The name Benedict's meant something
to people around here for a long time.

1778
03:08:59,350 --> 03:09:01,600
That there papoose down there...

1779
03:09:02,730 --> 03:09:04,440
is his name Benedict, too?

1780
03:09:12,240 --> 03:09:15,490
Yes. Come to think of it, it is.

1781
03:09:17,870 --> 03:09:19,620
Forget I asked you.

1782
03:09:20,080 --> 03:09:23,210
Go sit down,
and we ain't gonna have no trouble.

1783
03:09:23,500 --> 03:09:26,170
But this bunch's gonna eat
somewhere else.

1784
03:09:27,500 --> 03:09:29,130
All right, come on. Let's go.

1785
03:09:29,210 --> 03:09:30,670
Come on, you, too.

1786
03:09:34,800 --> 03:09:36,970
You're out of line, mister.

1787
03:12:00,700 --> 03:12:03,700
Is that the best
that old horse thief can do?

1788
03:12:04,490 --> 03:12:07,830
He's feeling your mood, darling.

1789
03:12:09,170 --> 03:12:12,250
<i>There's a lot of Clair de Lune
in both of you old fire-eaters.</i>

1790
03:12:13,250 --> 03:12:15,590
You're both rather gentle creatures.

1791
03:12:16,010 --> 03:12:17,340
How awful!

1792
03:12:21,340 --> 03:12:22,850
Those kids....

1793
03:12:23,510 --> 03:12:25,010
Look at them.

1794
03:12:25,510 --> 03:12:28,980
Those kids, in their infinite wisdom,
are smarter than we are.

1795
03:12:30,020 --> 03:12:32,860
They know I'm a disgrace.
And they don't hesitate to say so.

1796
03:12:35,230 --> 03:12:37,570
Even the calf's got my number.

1797
03:12:39,860 --> 03:12:42,530
I don't have to take it from a sheep!

1798
03:12:43,950 --> 03:12:45,450
Now, Jordan!

1799
03:12:52,330 --> 03:12:56,300
Hello, Vashti. We're all fine.
How'd you make it back?

1800
03:12:59,340 --> 03:13:02,180
-They all made it back in one piece.
-Jolly.

1801
03:13:02,890 --> 03:13:06,390
Yes, all our guests have finally gone.
Thank goodness!

1802
03:13:09,180 --> 03:13:11,850
But more have left than we bargained for.

1803
03:13:12,060 --> 03:13:16,070
Luz has gone on to Hollywood with Lola,
whatever the name was.

1804
03:13:18,440 --> 03:13:21,780
She decided she would like to see
how she liked Hollywood.

1805
03:13:23,910 --> 03:13:25,700
We never had one in the family.

1806
03:13:25,780 --> 03:13:27,580
Good Lord, an actress!

1807
03:13:30,080 --> 03:13:34,420
All you can do is raise them.
You can't live their lives for them.

1808
03:13:37,420 --> 03:13:40,010
Judy and Bob are out looking at a ranch.

1809
03:13:40,760 --> 03:13:41,920
A small one.

1810
03:13:44,140 --> 03:13:47,140
Jordy and Juana are gonna move
into Vientecito.

1811
03:13:47,430 --> 03:13:50,430
And we, we're home minding the babies.

1812
03:13:55,480 --> 03:13:59,820
The sun's going down over the yardarm.
When are you going to open up the bar?

1813
03:13:59,900 --> 03:14:01,440
Anytime. Go ahead.

1814
03:14:02,780 --> 03:14:05,700
Remember, one of these days
that bourbon's gonna kill you.

1815
03:14:05,780 --> 03:14:07,950
Okay. It'll be me or it.

1816
03:14:08,620 --> 03:14:10,370
One of us has got to go.

1817
03:14:12,790 --> 03:14:16,460
I'm going to stay right here.
It's coming onto spring.

1818
03:14:17,630 --> 03:14:20,630
Roundup time is no time
to be away from Reata.

1819
03:14:30,470 --> 03:14:34,480
Honey, everybody's on the move.
The strays are leaving the herd.

1820
03:14:36,980 --> 03:14:42,280
I wouldn't mind it too much if you wanted
to pack up and go back home for a spell.

1821
03:14:43,820 --> 03:14:44,860
Home?

1822
03:14:46,160 --> 03:14:50,490
Where do you think I've been
this last breathless quarter of a century?

1823
03:14:51,870 --> 03:14:53,000
Home.

1824
03:14:53,620 --> 03:14:55,790
Look, boy, I belong here!

1825
03:14:58,750 --> 03:15:01,750
You really want to know
what's gotten my goat?

1826
03:15:04,010 --> 03:15:06,840
My own grandson doesn't even look
like one of us.

1827
03:15:07,180 --> 03:15:09,850
He really looks like a little wetback.

1828
03:15:15,850 --> 03:15:18,350
<i>Little muchacho fires up, don't he?</i>

1829
03:15:20,020 --> 03:15:21,980
I'm sorry, Jordan Benedict IV.

1830
03:15:22,860 --> 03:15:25,190
There's times when a man
just has to be honest.

1831
03:15:28,610 --> 03:15:30,410
You know something, Leslie?

1832
03:15:31,580 --> 03:15:33,370
There's no use kidding.

1833
03:15:34,540 --> 03:15:36,040
I'm a failure.

1834
03:15:36,750 --> 03:15:40,000
Nothing has turned out like I had planned.

1835
03:15:43,630 --> 03:15:46,970
I just feel like my saddle's turning
right out from under me.

1836
03:15:49,930 --> 03:15:51,760
Do you want to know something?

1837
03:15:54,220 --> 03:15:56,060
I think you're great!

1838
03:15:58,810 --> 03:16:02,320
Don't ask me why.
Some things are difficult to explain.

1839
03:16:03,770 --> 03:16:08,110
You know all that fine riding
you used to do, and all that fancy roping...

1840
03:16:08,200 --> 03:16:11,240
and all that glamor stuff
you did to dazzle me?

1841
03:16:11,370 --> 03:16:12,910
It was impressive.

1842
03:16:14,450 --> 03:16:17,960
But none of it ever made you
quite as big a man to me...

1843
03:16:18,540 --> 03:16:21,880
as you were on the floor
of Sarge's hamburger joint.

1844
03:16:26,210 --> 03:16:28,300
When you tumbled rearward...

1845
03:16:28,470 --> 03:16:31,970
and landed crashing
into that pile of dirty dishes...

1846
03:16:33,390 --> 03:16:35,720
you were at last my hero.

1847
03:16:37,140 --> 03:16:39,690
That's what you always wanted to be.

1848
03:16:40,310 --> 03:16:41,350
Could be.

1849
03:16:42,060 --> 03:16:45,730
When we went into that place,
before the fight started....

1850
03:16:47,820 --> 03:16:50,490
What a fight! It was glorious!

1851
03:16:52,030 --> 03:16:55,620
Before we went in,
I was feeling like you are now.

1852
03:16:56,620 --> 03:16:58,450
I was thinking to myself:

1853
03:16:59,040 --> 03:17:00,160
" Well...

1854
03:17:00,250 --> 03:17:04,040
" Jordan and I, and the others behind us,
have been failures."

1855
03:17:05,540 --> 03:17:07,130
And then it happened.

1856
03:17:08,170 --> 03:17:12,640
You wound up on the floor, on your back,
in the middle of the salad.

1857
03:17:14,140 --> 03:17:15,600
And I said to myself:

1858
03:17:16,680 --> 03:17:17,720
" Well...

1859
03:17:18,520 --> 03:17:20,690
" after 100 years...

1860
03:17:21,690 --> 03:17:23,520
" the Benedict family...

1861
03:17:23,810 --> 03:17:26,520
" is a real big success."

1862
03:17:29,150 --> 03:17:31,320
You want to know something, Leslie?

1863
03:17:32,860 --> 03:17:34,870
If I live to be 90...

1864
03:17:36,740 --> 03:17:39,580
I'll never be able to figure you out.
