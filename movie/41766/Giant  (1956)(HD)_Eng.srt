1
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,450
There he is.

2
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,080
There's the stallion. That's War Winds.

3
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,660
Beautiful.

4
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,290
That's my daughter riding him. Leslie.

5
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,720
Leslie is my daughter. She's riding him.

6
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,510
Doctor, that sure is a beautiful animal.

7
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,390
We'll get to the horses
first thing in the morning.

8
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,690
Now you'll come up to the house
and get ready for dinner.

9
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,540
So you are from Nevada, Mr. Beckwith?

10
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,050
Texas, Mama.

11
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,010
You're from Texas, Mr. Beckwith?

12
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,970
Yes, ma'am, Texas. Benedict's the name.

13
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,470
You're here about the horses, aren't you?

14
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
Yes, ma'am.

15
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,850
I came to buy your stallion, War Winds, that
is if your daughter doesn't mind too much.

16
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,150
In all likelihood, our Leslie will
be leaving us soon in any case.

17
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,030
David is with the embassy in Washington.
He's been called back to England.

18
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,870
Will she like it there, do you think?

19
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,750
She's going to marry him?

20
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,880
Mother! Let me sell Mr. Benedict
War Winds.

21
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,840
I can tell you all his bad points.

22
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,090
For one thing, he eats too much,
doesn't he, Papa?

23
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,430
'Cause you see, it's either War
Winds or me. Something has to go.

24
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,929
Now Leslie you know very well that horse is
just too spirited for any woman to ride.

25
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:04,980
I know Miss Leslie that your horse is gonna miss
you and all this nice, green country, but...

26
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,900
I'll do my best to make him feel
right at home in Texas.

27
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,240
Isn't Texas green, Mr. Benedict?

28
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,990
Well, no ma'am, not altogether.

29
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,200
You must tell us about Texas,
Mr. Benedict.

30
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,200
Well, it's not that easy.

31
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,920
It's different than any other
state, I think.

32
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,460
At least that's what we think.
It's almost a different country.

33
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:34,800
From an Englishman's point of view,
its mere size takes your breath away.

34
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,970
Yes, it's big all right.

35
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,100
How large are your ranches?

36
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,440
Most every size. Large and small.

37
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,480
Mr. Benedict's Reata is
one of the largest of them all.

38
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,020
Oh, really?

39
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,360
And just how large is that?

40
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,570
It's one of the biggest.

41
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,620
How big is that?

42
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,500
There are one or two others as big,
I suppose, up where we come from...

43
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,290
and some larger ones
on the coastal plains.

44
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,010
Can't you be more specific?

45
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:15,130
What's the size of your place?
50,000? 20,000 acres?

46
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,350
Around a half million.
595,000 acres, to be exact.

47
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,190
I'd call that quite a parcel!

48
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,900
How many acres did you say,
Mr. Benedict?

49
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,650
He said 595,000 acres, Mama.

50
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,320
And you should see the greedy look
on your face.

51
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,410
Witness excused.

52
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,250
Won't you join us at the Hunt Ball?
I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

53
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,670
No, thank you, Miss Leslie.

54
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,340
I'm afraid I wouldn't look good
in this outfit.

55
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,360
I like your country.

56
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:16,400
Why don't you stay a while
and really see something of it?

57
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,700
It's roundup time in my country.
Big spring roundup.

58
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,870
Your country?

59
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,660
Reata.

60
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:31,750
Your country, my country.
You make us sound so far apart.

61
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,970
Maybe you could come out and see it...

62
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,560
if you get a chance.

63
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,920
I'll be off real early
in the morning, so...

64
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,340
goodbye.

65
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,130
I'm awfully glad you came.

66
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,090
I'm not going to say goodbye to you
in the moonlight.

67
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:25,180
It would just be too touching. Good night!

68
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
"Texas."

69
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,770
Are you in love with him?

70
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,640
Yes, I think so.

71
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,900
Will you do me a favor
and run along to bed?

72
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,160
- Leslie?
- Good night.

73
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,130
If you won't marry David Karfrey...

74
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,050
will you give him to me?

75
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,880
Yes! Now, good night.

76
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,870
As far as I'm concerned, it's a deal.

77
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,960
- $10,000 is a lot of money.
- It's a lot of horse.

78
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,970
Let's have some breakfast and get going.

79
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,110
- Why, Leslie!
- Good morning.

80
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,670
You don't look as if you'd been dancing
all night, Miss Leslie.

81
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,290
I came home at 10:55.

82
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,380
I read about Texas until 5:00 this morning.

83
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,170
Let the poor boy
eat his breakfast in peace.

84
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,100
It takes a heap of reading, Texas does.

85
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,060
We really stole Texas, didn't we?

86
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,770
I mean, away from Mexico.

87
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,230
You're catching me a bit early
to start joking.

88
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:09,360
But I'm not joking.
It's all right there in the history books.

89
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,580
Mr. Austin came down
with 300 families, it says.

90
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,000
The next thing you know,
they're claiming it from Mexico.

91
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,380
I never heard anything as ignorant
as some Eastern people...

92
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,460
Oh, please, Jordan.

93
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,590
I'm only speaking impersonally.
About history.

94
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,680
You all think
that the glory happened in the East...

95
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,010
with Valley Forge and Bunker Hill!

96
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,560
Do you know about San Jacinto?
Have you heard about the Alamo?

97
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,350
Why, certainly.

98
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,860
I read about them all last night.

99
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,820
I didn't mean to be impolite,
but it's so new to me.

100
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,200
I just mean, it's just all so new...

101
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,540
and so fascinating!

102
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:01,580
You mustn't talk that way to a Texan.
They feel very strongly about their state.

103
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,000
He shouldn't take it so hard.

104
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,630
Jordan, you would think
somebody had spoiled you terribly.

105
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,800
Your wife or somebody.

106
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,310
I haven't any wife. I live with my sister.

107
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,320
Why aren't you married?

108
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,910
First you attack a man's country, and
now you try to pry into his family life.

109
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,740
Thank you, Doctor.

110
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,410
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

111
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,120
- Good morning, Lacey.
- Good morning, Papa.

112
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,840
How are we doing?

113
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,760
We'll have to be getting along soon
if you're going to make your train.

114
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,470
- Good morning, everybody.
- Good morning, Nancy.

115
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,180
Good morning, dear.

116
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,970
Good morning, Mr. Benedict.

117
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,520
Isn't this a beautiful morning?

118
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,200
Leslie, if Mr. Benedict has finished
his breakfast...

119
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,580
why don't you show him the stables?

120
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,540
We've just quarreled politely about Texas.
It's no use trying to pawn me off on him.

121
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,210
And anyway, Mother...

122
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,470
he's probably engaged to marry
the daughter of the adjoining ranch...

123
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,840
who, though beautiful,
is comparatively poor.

124
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,510
She only has 200,000 acres
and half a million cows.

125
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,940
Is she pretty?

126
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,480
We must hurry.

127
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,700
Mr. Benedict and I will have
to be leaving now.

128
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,340
Who, may I ask, is the lucky young lady
that you're going to marry...

129
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,550
with all those cows?

130
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,470
I'll get the car.

131
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,520
It's funny, ma'am.
My neighbor is a girl, Vashti Hake.

132
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,700
There was some talk of my marrying her,
but I'm not.

133
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,330
Come on, if you want to catch that train.

134
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,710
It all sounds so romantic!

135
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,790
Come along, David, you're for me.

136
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,850
What's that, a wolf?

137
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,600
No, honey.

138
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,480
It's just a little old coyote.

139
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,910
Don't you think you've done
enough sightseeing?

140
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,740
Tell me when we're in Texas.

141
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,540
That's Texas you've been looking at.

142
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,370
For the last eight hours.

143
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,630
I don't know how other brides feel
on their honeymoon...

144
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,010
but I'm having a lovely time.

145
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,680
We can't say it's been dull.

146
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,020
That is, so far anyway.

147
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,830
Wake up, honey. We're here, honey.

148
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,500
Where?

149
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,050
Hello.

150
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,630
Good morning.

151
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,890
Is that Texas?

152
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,520
It's Benedict. That's where we ship from.

153
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,230
These people never learn!

154
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,400
I'm Mrs. Benedict.

155
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,330
That means, " Welcome, the newlyweds."

156
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,710
Let's go, Leslie.

157
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,130
And what is your name?

158
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,460
That's a beautiful name.

159
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,010
Come on, it's 50 miles to coffee.

160
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,400
This is it, honey. This is your home.

161
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,530
But it's huge!

162
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,790
I thought it was a ranch house.

163
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:20,580
My old man built it to show the cotton
crowd we were just as high-powered.

164
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,670
It's enormous just for the two of us.

165
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,380
Luz lives here with me.

166
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
With us.

167
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:31,720
She's run the house since Ma passed on.
Some say she even runs the ranch!

168
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,730
Take it easy, Leslie.

169
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,310
What are your names?

170
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,460
What do you mean behave?

171
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:08,090
Here we don't make a fuss
over those people. You're a Texan now.

172
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,680
Is that a state of mind? I'm still myself.

173
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,600
You're my wife, honey. You're a Benedict.

174
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:24,810
I still have a mind of my own.
Elsewhere, being gracious is acceptable.

175
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,230
We're gracious, but....

176
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,120
Fine thing...

177
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,330
standing here quarreling
with rice still in our hair!

178
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,990
It's so nice and cool!

179
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,710
I thought somebody was hurt, maybe.

180
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,880
We didn't know you were there.

181
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:32,710
Well, we're home. We're here.

182
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,220
I've been looking for you for weeks.

183
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,340
We weren't expected to be back sooner,
were we?

184
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,810
With all the spring work to be done,
the roundup...

185
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,850
I didn't figure Bick would stay away.

186
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,610
If I miss a roundup every time I have
a honeymoon, I won't miss much, will I?

187
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,910
I thought I fired him off this place.

188
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:11,630
Where do you think you're going
with my automobile?

189
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,670
Just hold on.

190
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,050
Don't go taking off on me.
That old truck broke down again.

191
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,930
You want me going down the road?

192
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,560
That's exactly what I was going to do.

193
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,770
But she said,
"You stay on and do your work."

194
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,900
Next time I tell you to get, you get!

195
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,200
Bick and Jett are everlasting jangling
about something.

196
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,580
<i>- Madama is the one who told me to stay.
- That's right.</i>

197
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,370
With you away,
we needed all the help there was.

198
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:49,960
They're all scared to death of her.
You know that.

199
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,750
Everyone, except you and me.

200
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,340
You just tend to your work.

201
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,380
Tell me who is the boss around here...

202
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:01,930
and I'll be glad to do anything you want.
Just tell me who's the boss.

203
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,430
This is Bick's new wife.

204
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,770
Leslie, this boy here is Jett Rink.

205
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,150
- Hello.
- He works for us.

206
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:25,950
You'd better get going, Jett,
and get that truck fixed.

207
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,380
Nobody is king in this country.

208
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,800
Nobody, no matter what they think.

209
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:47,140
<i>I'm sorry, honey. Things go loco here
every time I'm away.</i>

210
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,440
Remember the time of the big rodeo?

211
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,570
Old Kale Beebe blew in,
higher than a kite...

212
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,570
slept on the sofa in your office.

213
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:06,530
He must have had nightmares.
He cut the couch to ribbons with his spurs.

214
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,660
This here is Bick's room.

215
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,040
This down here is your room, honey.

216
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,460
Look....

217
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,170
We're married.

218
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,550
You know how that is.

219
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,270
We'll take the connecting rooms.

220
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:33,770
We'll make that into a sitting room
where we can sit and talk...

221
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,690
and the breeze can get at us.

222
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,620
Breakfast's ready.

223
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:34,080
You and Jordan
have had breakfast already?

224
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:38,170
We have our coffee and talk
every morning of our lives at 5:00.

225
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,670
Try and get things rounded up for the day.

226
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,180
I thought I was going riding with him
to the roundup.

227
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,140
It would've been too hot for you.
I told him so.

228
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,270
Bring it in here.

229
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,100
You gotta watch out for that sun.
It's rough.

230
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
Sit down.

231
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,900
Your blood's too thin. That's the trouble
with a lot of Easterners.

232
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,830
Thank you.

233
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,080
I'm fine, Luz.

234
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,670
I'm a lot tougher perhaps
than you think I am.

235
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:23,710
Me...

236
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:29,050
I never had a sick day in my life.
Except when I got thrown and tromped on.

237
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,430
All you gotta do is take it easy.

238
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,890
This rich Texas air will fix you up.

239
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,690
Don't you worry none
about being lonesome.

240
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,480
I'll round up the neighbors.

241
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,530
You're going to meet some folks.

242
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,490
Yes, indeed.
You're going to meet some folks.

243
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,240
This is Mr. and Mrs. Bale Clinch.

244
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:57,660
Bick, it's about time. Howdy, ma'am.

245
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:00,250
I'd like you to meet
my little wife, Adarene.

246
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,840
I'm mighty pleased to meet you.

247
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,340
This is Judge Whiteside.

248
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:09,630
How do you do, Mrs. Benedict?
We sure are proud to have you here.

249
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,720
Bick, congratulations.
Mighty happy for you, boy.

250
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,310
She sure is pretty.

251
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,680
I think so.

252
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,850
Here's Ula Japes.

253
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,690
Glad to meet you, ma'am.

254
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,310
Good to see you, Bick.

255
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,230
This is Ms. Wharton.

256
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,480
Howdy, Leslie. Mighty happy to meet you.

257
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,740
Fernie Kling.

258
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,360
We're glad to have you with us.

259
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,030
You've really done well for yourself.

260
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,280
Thank you, Fernie.

261
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,880
Now you'll meet the neighbor
I told you about.

262
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,590
The one who lives 50 miles away
with all those cows?

263
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,930
Vashti, I'd like you to meet my wife.

264
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,640
Hello, Vashti. So nice to meet you.

265
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,850
Jordan told me so much about you.

266
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,190
Mighty glad to know you.

267
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,610
I'm awfully glad we're neighbors.

268
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,480
I hope we'll be real close friends.

269
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,960
My name is Mort Snythe.
They call me Pinky.

270
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,840
Come here.

271
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,670
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- We'll be seeing you.

272
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,550
- This will perk you up, Miss Leslie.
- Thank you.

273
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,850
I propose a toast to a daughter
of old Maryland...

274
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:24,480
now blooming into a citizen
of the Lone Star State. To the bride!

275
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,200
Are you all right?

276
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,860
I'm fine, don't worry.

277
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,030
- There's more than one bride here today.
- How's that, Vashti?

278
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:44,540
Mort Snythe and I were married yesterday
in Hermosa.

279
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,470
I'm gonna kiss him!

280
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,310
I guess that leaves only me.

281
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:08,480
Why, Luz, everybody in the county knows
you'd rather herd cattle than make love!

282
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,070
One thing you gotta say for cattle:

283
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,740
You put your brand on one of them,
you know where it's at!

284
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,530
Come and get it!

285
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,890
The best food you ever ate, honey.

286
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,350
<i>This is real Mexican barbacoa.</i>

287
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,060
That's where we get the word " barbecue."

288
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,740
What is that?

289
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,240
Calf's head.

290
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:07,290
We take it and wrap it in clean white cloth
and then wrap it tight in canvas...

291
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:11,250
and put it down in a pit
of hot mesquite coals for 18 hours.

292
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,750
And do those brains taste sweet!

293
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,590
How fascinating!

294
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,430
I don't think I'm really terribly hungry.
It must be the heat.

295
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,350
You call this hot?

296
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,850
Wait till July!

297
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,020
Eat it while it's hot!

298
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,610
What's the matter with her, Bick?

299
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,150
That's what I was afraid of!

300
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,210
Leslie?

301
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,810
Good morning, Luz.

302
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,600
What are you doing up?

303
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,190
Getting breakfast.

304
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,990
I think there's something
we should get in the clear.

305
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,620
I don't want to take your place.
I want you to know that.

306
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,080
But I can't have you
taking my place either.

307
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,840
I can't be just a guest
in my husband's house.

308
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,300
There you are.

309
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,760
Good morning, darling.

310
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,550
- How are you feeling?
- Fine.

311
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,640
You look fine.

312
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,520
I want everybody to know, no matter
what happens around here in the future...

313
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,110
I am never going to faint again.

314
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:07,280
I'll never get the hang of you,
Mrs. Benedict.

315
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,340
A horse that cost you a lot for
breeding stock, I'd use it for breeding.

316
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,640
I wouldn't let anyone ride him.
I wouldn't care if she's your wife.

317
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:34,600
I'd see she rides a more gentle animal
if I were you.

318
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,480
She's going to fall off and break her neck.

319
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:58,380
<i>That's Old Polo. He's head vaquero.</i>

320
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:02,380
He's been here longer than any of us.

321
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,130
Since Grandpa Benedict's time.

322
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,230
Look at them, honey!

323
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:23,190
There's never been anything like them
in this world, I can tell you.

324
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,570
Did you ever see such stock?

325
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,110
Are they all ours?

326
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,370
These and 59,000 others just like them.

327
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,580
Granddaddy and his boys
used to drive his longhorns...

328
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:40,630
great herds of them,
all the way to Kansas.

329
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,220
He was a pretty good old boy.
I mean, he was tough, too.

330
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,100
My old man brought in stock from Europe
and bred them in the best ways.

331
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,220
Look out!

332
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,400
This right here is the result, honey.

333
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,440
Look at them.

334
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,210
How are you doing?

335
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,420
Tired, honey?

336
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,710
Don't you worry about me.

337
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,010
I'm a tough Texan now.

338
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,350
You know, I love you, Tex.

339
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,410
Howdy, everybody.

340
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:44,250
Hold on a minute. I want you
to take Mrs. Benedict back in with you.

341
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,550
Go with Jett, and get out of this heat.

342
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,090
Honey, I'm fine, really.

343
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:51,920
There's no use overdoing it.
Go along with Jett.

344
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,900
Good morning, Jett.

345
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,530
Take it easy, Jett.

346
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,120
I don't want to chew on this, Bick...

347
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,370
but I think we'd better get it straight.

348
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,710
I run the house, don't I?

349
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,920
Her house. Her kitchen. Her help.

350
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,260
She doesn't even speak Spanish.

351
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,510
They understand English
when they want to.

352
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,800
I know how to handle Mexicans.
I've done it all my life.

353
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,100
They'd sit on their honkers all day
if I didn't keep after them.

354
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,810
All right, Luz. Cool off.

355
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:49,070
I thought we ought to talk
without her around.

356
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:55,400
I don't want to feel that you're setting up
against me, Bick.

357
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,620
Nobody is setting up against you, Luz.

358
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,580
That gal's my wife.

359
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:10,340
And you're fair enough, I think,
to try and get along with her.

360
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,760
All right.

361
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:19,470
I'll get a horse and help push
the stock along.

362
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,010
Maybe it'll make me feel better.

363
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,390
You gotta push something.

364
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,480
When I get enough, I'll ride on in.

365
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,030
Why did you come to Texas?

366
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:38,780
I mean, everybody else's trying
to get away from here.

367
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,990
Me, I'll get out of here one of these days.

368
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,040
This is my husband's land.

369
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,620
This is his home.

370
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:57,220
Who gets hold of this much land
unless they took it off somebody else?

371
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:01,890
You're not exactly loyal
to your employer, Jett.

372
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:04,390
No, I'm not complaining.

373
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,640
They bought this land long ago.

374
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,480
The Benedicts.

375
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:14,530
- They got it though purchase, years ago.
- Took it from some ignorant Mexicans.

376
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:18,780
That's not true. They bought and traded
for Spanish land grants.

377
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,040
They paid for it all right.
They paid five cents an acre.

378
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:28,410
I know my folks were here long enough
to get rich, too.

379
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,000
Except they just weren't so foxy.

380
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:20,630
Keep it on, boy. I'll ride him.

381
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:24,800
<i>Nobody rides him but the señora.</i>

382
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:27,260
I've been riding what I want to
for 30 years.

383
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:29,430
Already he bucked off Lopez.

384
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,650
If he bucks me down,
he won't be the first one that's done it.

385
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,360
I suppose you came out here
to show me how to run things, too.

386
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:40,530
Let's go.

387
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,460
I'm not too awful bad now.

388
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:04,300
<i>I've got a few friends.
And Madama likes me.</i>

389
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,970
And Bick....
Now, even old Bick likes me a little bit.

390
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,730
Of course,
they don't like me quite enough to...

391
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,650
kind of divvy up
what they got way too much of.

392
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:29,330
You're an odd one, aren't you, Jett?
But I like you.

393
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,300
I like you, too.

394
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:45,470
You're the best-looking gal
we've seen around here in a long time.

395
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:52,430
The prettiest one
I think I've seen down here.

396
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,560
Thank you, Jett.

397
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,100
That's a very nice compliment.

398
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:00,900
I'll tell my husband of that,
with your approval.

399
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,160
No, I wouldn't do that.

400
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,120
No, I wouldn't do that.

401
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,740
Beautiful Reata!

402
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,830
Them's your neighbors live there.

403
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:59,000
Them kids there.
Them's your ranch people.

404
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,420
Those are Angel Obregon's kids.

405
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,210
That's the man who met us at the train.

406
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,510
Sure in good shape, ain't they?
Whole bunch of them sick.

407
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,260
What's the matter with them?

408
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:15,140
I don't know. Just sick. Every one of them.

409
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,690
Wait a minute. I want to get out here.

410
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,940
I wouldn't do that if I was you.

411
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:23,900
Wait.

412
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,240
You're the boss.
And you know it, don't you?

413
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,040
May I come in?

414
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:43,880
I'm Mrs. Benedict.

415
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,590
<i>Perdoname...</i>

416
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,340
that I do not rise.

417
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,470
The baby is sick.

418
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:56,930
My milk is not good.

419
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:26,020
Have you seen a doctor?

420
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:30,530
Doctor? It is too far to come.

421
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:37,580
Mrs. Leslie,
I think we'd better be getting on.

422
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:42,160
This baby is extremely ill.

423
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,040
You're not supposed to be in there.

424
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,340
Try not to worry, Mrs. Obregon.
I'll be back soon.

425
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,380
Bick's going to blow a gasket.

426
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:10,400
What is it?

427
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,070
What's happened to him?

428
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,530
What's wrong?

429
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,550
Where in the world have you been?
I've been looking for you, too.

430
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,590
What happened to her?

431
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,510
I stopped by the village.

432
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:43,770
What happened?

433
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:45,310
It's just awful.

434
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:50,310
I don't know. She was riding War Winds.

435
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,820
She might have been thrown
or something.

436
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,870
What does the doctor say?

437
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:04,870
It's bad.

438
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,790
She hit her head on a mesquite stump.

439
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:21,640
She's been riding since she was six.

440
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,270
She could ride anything.
And now this happens.

441
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:51,630
How is she?

442
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,630
She's in a state of shock. Very serious.

443
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:57,300
Concussion, possible hemorrhaging.

444
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,260
I'm doing all I can do.

445
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,140
I called Dr. Borneholm on the phone.

446
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,640
He'll be along any minute.

447
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:25,890
If only I hadn't bought that horse....

448
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:29,020
Don't blame yourself, Jordan.

449
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:35,020
If I hadn't, she'd be alive right now.

450
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:37,690
Don't blame yourself.

451
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:43,610
This is a great misfortune,
but no one is to blame.

452
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,620
Things happen.

453
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:09,220
- Mrs. Benedict, this is Dr. Borneholm.
- How do you do?

454
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:12,930
I sure wish I could've made it for Luz.

455
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:16,310
Dr. Walker did everything he could,
I assure you of that.

456
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:24,150
Dr. Walker, there's more for you to do,
I'm afraid.

457
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:27,450
Mrs. Obregon's baby is very sick.

458
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:32,330
His temperature must be at least 105.
Will you stop by, please?

459
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,330
Mrs. Obregon?

460
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:36,420
In the village.

461
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:38,790
Jett will take you.

462
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,970
I'll go with you myself, Doctor.

463
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,810
What is this?

464
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:00,230
You can't do that.

465
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:02,150
He can't go there.

466
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,240
He's our doctor.

467
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:06,820
- Our doctor?
- Yes.

468
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,410
You mean, the Benedicts' only?

469
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:12,540
No, I mean, all of us.

470
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:16,120
He doesn't tend those people.

471
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:21,290
They have a way of doing things
by themselves.

472
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,380
How did she get there?

473
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,890
Now, don't go climbing on me.
I don't feel too good about it.

474
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,640
Jordan, darling,
I don't think you quite understand.

475
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:37,690
There's a child who's very sick.
I must take Dr. Walker.

476
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:41,520
You'll go, won't you, Doctor?

477
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,570
I'll be back just as soon as I can.

478
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:39,460
I'm a lot better, honey.

479
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:43,130
That's a good boy.

480
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:51,720
Where's my horse?

481
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:57,930
I shot him.

482
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,020
Bone was broken.

483
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:06,980
Somebody had to do it.
I thought it'd be better if it was me.

484
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:13,110
The baby?

485
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:17,790
He is alive, thanks to Dr. Walker.

486
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:24,880
Good.

487
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,270
We need you in here for a few minutes
if you can break away.

488
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:44,810
You're sure holding up fine.

489
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,650
In times like this
folks really show what they're made of...

490
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:49,860
and you're sure holding up fine.

491
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:01,450
Vern and me thought a lot of Luz.

492
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,870
I guess everybody did.

493
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,960
At least everybody came.

494
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:09,380
It's the biggest gathering for a funeral
I ever saw in Texas.

495
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,800
It's a shame Luz wasn't here to enjoy it.

496
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:16,470
I mean, she always did like
a big get-together.

497
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:19,180
She'd have had a fine time.

498
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:23,140
- Come to see us.
- Thank you. Bye-bye.

499
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:24,350
Come see us.

500
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:31,610
I think you'll agree, your sister
was a very generous woman.

501
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:37,030
She wanted that boy
to have something worthwhile.

502
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,530
Now, that little piece of land is worth...

503
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:43,000
$500, $600 at most.

504
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:48,330
I'm going to ask you, in reverence
to the memory of Luz Benedict...

505
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:52,170
I'm going to ask you
to give one Jett Rink...

506
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:55,680
a check for twice the value of that land.

507
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:58,300
We can clean up the whole matter
right now.

508
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:11,570
Come inside, I want to talk to you.

509
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:13,150
Just a minute, Bick.

510
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,650
I'm afraid I'm going to beat you to it.

511
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:18,660
I'm quitting.

512
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:23,080
I lost the one friend I had in this place,
and I know it, too.

513
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:27,250
So I quit, I dead quit.
You don't have to say another word to me.

514
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:29,000
Nobody's firing you.

515
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:31,340
Boy, howdy, nobody's firing me.

516
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:33,630
I told you, I quit!

517
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:35,380
Nobody wants to fire you.

518
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,390
Come inside and listen
to what we have to say.

519
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,100
Come on in here, Jett.
Come on in here, boy.

520
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:45,520
Hi, Jett. Nice to see you.

521
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:48,270
- Howdy, Jett. Good to see you.
- Howdy, Jett.

522
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,940
Have my seat, boy. Sit right down.
You sure look good today.

523
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:56,740
Sit down. I'm going to tell you about
a piece of luck that's come your way.

524
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:59,950
Sit down, young man,
and make yourself comfortable.

525
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:04,290
It's a real bad wind
that doesn't blow somebody some good.

526
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:12,250
I don't have to tell you that Luz was
a woman of strong, sentimental feeling.

527
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:19,760
She prepared a list of things she wanted
to give all the people on Reata.

528
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:23,050
Yes. We find that she wanted to....

529
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:29,190
We find that her bequest to you was
in the nature of a little piece of ground.

530
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:33,810
It's the little piece we used to call
Buffalo Wallow.

531
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:42,490
She wanted to give you something.
I know she did.

532
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:48,790
It's always been my aim to try
to keep Reata intact within the family.

533
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:55,130
Now, that little piece is worth at most....
How much, Bale?

534
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:58,590
At the most, I'd say $500 or $600, Bick.

535
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:03,510
Mr. Benedict, wanting to honor
his sister's wishes...

536
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:07,850
and, of course, right along
with his own personal feeling for you....

537
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:12,400
He wants to see to it that you get
something really worthwhile.

538
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,820
Now, to get down to the point, Mr. Rink...

539
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:19,940
we're prepared to place in your hands,
in cash...

540
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:23,570
the sum of $1,200.

541
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:37,170
$1,200...

542
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,840
which, any of these gentlemen here
I'm sure will be happy to tell you...

543
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:44,090
is twice the value of that land.

544
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:47,850
- Definitely.
- At least twice the value of that land.

545
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:06,620
That's a lot of money.
What are you aiming do with all of it?

546
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,290
You're in the chips now, boy.

547
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:12,580
There it is. There it is, boy.

548
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:15,580
And it's all yours.

549
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,380
I don't know what to say.

550
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:31,020
She sure was a fine lady.

551
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:33,430
Yes, she was a fine lady. Hallelujah!

552
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:34,730
Amen.

553
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:47,240
I want you to know
that I appreciate her generosity.

554
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:51,120
Yours, too, Bick. And you all.

555
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:54,080
I want to thank you for it.

556
01:01:58,290 --> 01:01:59,750
You know something, Bick?

557
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:04,800
I don't know, but it might not be...

558
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:09,010
<i>a pretty good idea
to gamble along with old Madama.</i>

559
01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:13,100
How do you mean?

560
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,770
Just gamble on.

561
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,310
Just keep what she gave me.

562
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:27,990
I'm sentimental, too, Bick.

563
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:36,620
I think it's good to gamble on with her.

564
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,380
I know that land ain't worth much...

565
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:45,510
but then someday I just might up...

566
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,510
and put my own fence around her...

567
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,760
and call her Little Reata.

568
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:59,150
See you.

569
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:08,860
There's one thing on this earth more
important than money, and that's land!

570
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:11,490
I heard Luz say it a thousand times.

571
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:14,160
Pa said it and Bick, too. And it's true!

572
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:17,620
If you ever get to Deep Smith,
you come and pay us a visit.

573
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:20,080
We're just on the other side of Umbarger.

574
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:23,500
Only a little-bitty, no-account piece,
only we had a run of luck.

575
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:26,960
- Only? Why, a gusher came in last year.
- How wonderful.

576
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:29,340
Right now it's bringing in a million.

577
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:31,640
- A million gallons?
- Dollars.

578
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:33,720
A million dollars a year?

579
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,510
A million dollars a month.

580
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,520
- Goodbye. Thanks for treating us right.
- Thank you for coming.

581
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:18,140
I just love talking to you, Uncle Bawley.

582
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:22,350
Now that it's over, you get your fellow...

583
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:24,680
to take you around
and show you our country.

584
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,850
See San Antonio, Dallas and Houston.

585
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,820
I'm so impatient.
I want to see it all right now.

586
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:38,240
You don't have to hurry, honey.
It'll be here when you get around to it.

587
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:41,240
It's been here a long time.

588
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:46,710
And when you've seen it all
and have lived with it as I have...

589
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:52,460
in 25 years from now,
you'll feel about Texas just like I do.

590
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:55,590
Twenty-five years from now!

591
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:59,010
Twenty-five years from now
I'll be almost 50.

592
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:01,970
It's a nice age, Leslie.

593
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:05,930
You'll see wonderful things in Texas
when you're 50.

594
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:09,520
Perhaps.

595
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:13,070
But I won't care as much then.

596
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:14,650
You'll care more.

597
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:18,780
Because then
you'll have been part of it all.

598
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:20,910
Come on, we need you in the powwow.

599
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,580
I'm coming, gentlemen.

600
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,630
You get with it, Gomez.
Get your people out.

601
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,260
I don't want any of them
sitting on their honkers come election day.

602
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:41,930
<i>Everything will be bueno, señor.
It will be the same: good.</i>

603
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,770
I love you.

604
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:57,940
Thank you.

605
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:01,570
We're just talking business. Just business.

606
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,080
Please, don't mind me.

607
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:07,620
Do go on.

608
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:12,210
I'll listen, quiet as a little old mouse.

609
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:16,300
You'd be bored, honey.

610
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:18,050
This is dull.

611
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:21,010
Why, I'd be fascinated.

612
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,850
We're talking about politics.

613
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:30,770
You married me in Washington,
remember, darling?

614
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:34,480
I lived next door to politics.
Brought up with it.

615
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,900
Please go on talking. I'd love it.

616
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,780
This is men's stuff.

617
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:45,280
Leslie, how about a cup of coffee
or a drink?

618
01:08:49,410 --> 01:08:50,580
Men's stuff!

619
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:54,420
Lord have mercy!

620
01:08:56,670 --> 01:09:01,010
Set up my spinning wheel, girls.
I'll join the harem section in a minute.

621
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:06,010
Don't you go worrying
your pretty little head about politics.

622
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:09,520
You mean my pretty, empty head,
don't you, Judge?

623
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:14,850
Could I get the coffee for you?

624
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:19,690
You, too, Uncle Brutus?

625
01:09:22,110 --> 01:09:24,110
You don't feel well, Leslie.

626
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,700
I feel just great!

627
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:30,120
My adrenaline glands
are pumping beautifully.

628
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,580
If I may say so before retiring...

629
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:40,630
you gentlemen date back 100,000 years.

630
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:45,380
You ought to be wearing leopard skins
and carrying clubs.

631
01:09:45,630 --> 01:09:46,760
Politics!

632
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:48,430
Business!

633
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:53,350
What's so masculine about a conversation
that a woman can't enter into it?

634
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:57,400
Leslie, you're tired.

635
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:03,070
Perhaps I am.

636
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,800
I reckon I'll go on upstairs
and get my beauty sleep.

637
01:10:24,090 --> 01:10:25,630
You go ahead on, honey.

638
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:29,760
Good night, gentlemen.

639
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:41,980
That's right.

640
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:46,150
Send the children on up to bed
so the grownups can talk.

641
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:51,780
Good night, honey.

642
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:30,320
I must have dropped off.

643
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:37,250
Darling, I am sorry
about my caveman speech.

644
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,670
I'll apologize to the others first thing,
I promise.

645
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,210
That's big of you.

646
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,630
You certainly distinguished yourself
this evening.

647
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,340
- Shh, they can hear.
- Hear? They heard you already.

648
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:54,140
Every word you said out there.
We date back 100,000 years.

649
01:11:54,970 --> 01:11:57,640
I said I was sorry about the name-calling.

650
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:01,020
It was very impolite, I know.

651
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:04,650
But in principle, I was absolutely right.

652
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:08,440
You come down here
and try to tell us how to run things.

653
01:12:08,530 --> 01:12:10,860
Insulting my friends and everything.

654
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,160
Now you look here, Leslie.

655
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:16,700
You're my wife, Mrs. Jordan Benedict.

656
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:21,870
I'm asking you, when will you settle down
and behave like everybody else?

657
01:12:23,210 --> 01:12:25,670
- Never!
- Who do you think you are, anyhow?

658
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:27,670
Joan of Arc, or something?

659
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:45,360
Jordan, where are you going?

660
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:49,530
Jordan, take off your hat.

661
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,530
Carrying on like Carrie Nation!

662
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:57,580
Preaching stuff that's none
of your business, fixing the world.

663
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,000
Why don't you join a club?

664
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:02,540
Honestly, Jordan.
You make me sound just awful.

665
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:07,710
I'm not all that bad.

666
01:13:08,710 --> 01:13:11,550
You knew what a frightful girl I was
when you married me.

667
01:13:12,050 --> 01:13:14,390
I did not deceive you, sir.

668
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:19,390
From the first moment,
I couldn't have been more unpleasant.

669
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:25,150
Anyway, you're stuck with me.

670
01:13:30,190 --> 01:13:32,190
Yes, I guess.

671
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:37,370
Honey, take your hat off.

672
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:52,760
Besides...

673
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:55,220
you love me very much.

674
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:05,270
That fine mind of yours
gets pretty repulsive at times.

675
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:09,270
That's not what you told me on the train.

676
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:13,400
Now you're gonna throw that up to me.

677
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:15,400
I thought what we....

678
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:19,780
I thought what we said on the train
was in confidence.

679
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,000
Of course, darling.

680
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:27,670
But I'll never forget a single word
you say to me.

681
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:31,090
You can be pretty wonderful at times.

682
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:45,640
Come on, partner.

683
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:49,150
Why don't you kick off your spurs?

684
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:13,000
What a glorious, gorgeous,
brand-new day!

685
01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:18,050
Let's spend every hour of
it, just you and I.

686
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:19,930
Honey, I'm beat.

687
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:21,640
Why?

688
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:26,350
You have all the good things in the world.

689
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:29,520
And a woman
who loves you very, very much.

690
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:42,030
But that arguing takes a lot out of me.

691
01:15:47,870 --> 01:15:49,620
That was just frightful.

692
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:55,050
The best part about quarreling
is making up.

693
01:15:57,050 --> 01:16:00,010
When we make up, we make up.
Don't we, honey?

694
01:16:02,970 --> 01:16:07,640
Why can't we take a trip, really see Texas?
Just let somebody else run Reata.

695
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:09,890
Couldn't we?

696
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:14,110
Honey, I want you to understand this.

697
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:16,820
I run Reata at all times.

698
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:19,570
That's the way it is.

699
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:23,320
Everything that's in it and on it
is run by me.

700
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:25,740
Don't raise your voice.

701
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:27,910
That's the way it's always been.

702
01:16:28,290 --> 01:16:31,540
Everything that has a Reata brand on it
is run by me.

703
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:36,090
Does that include me?

704
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:43,050
That's the way my father ran this outfit
and my grandfather, too. All of it.

705
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:46,560
He kept it together for his son,
and my father for his.

706
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:49,430
And I'm keeping it together for mine.

707
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:51,940
All 595,000 square miles?

708
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:53,480
All of it. For my son.

709
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:57,070
You could at least say " our son."

710
01:16:58,110 --> 01:16:59,110
Our son.

711
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:04,320
Don't you think that might be
a little too much for one little baby?

712
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:06,450
Not if he's a Benedict.

713
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:13,790
You'd better hope this is a boy.

714
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:20,340
Our baby.
I just said I'm hoping it's a boy.

715
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:23,970
What do you mean?

716
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:26,720
Why didn't you tell me?

717
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:30,140
I'm telling you now.

718
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,730
Why didn't you tell me?
I mean, I should know.

719
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:41,820
- Are you sure?
- Sure.

720
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:47,620
And our baby is going to be a boy.
I know it.

721
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,330
A boy very much like his father.

722
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:56,920
In many ways...

723
01:17:58,630 --> 01:17:59,920
but not all.

724
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:11,390
Shouldn't she be putting on
a little weight?

725
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:18,110
It's natural, I think,
for him to be gaining faster.

726
01:18:19,190 --> 01:18:20,190
Let me see.

727
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:26,950
Very heavy.

728
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:36,000
Hello, sweetheart.

729
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:38,920
He's building up fine.

730
01:18:40,290 --> 01:18:42,300
"I am now stronger than ever.

731
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:46,010
"I'm helping a young Dr. Guerra
get started here.

732
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:50,680
"Almost every day I find myself
walking three or four miles...

733
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:56,060
<i>"through the dusty and dirty streets
of Vientecito village."</i>

734
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:08,030
Hello, Angel. How are you?

735
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:10,030
Good.

736
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:18,920
I'd like to speak to Mr. Gomez, the boss.

737
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,880
The man that runs this place.

738
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,460
Mrs. Benedict, what is it I can do?

739
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:27,590
Mr. Gomez, I'm going to leave
Dr. Guerra here with you.

740
01:19:28,010 --> 01:19:30,470
He'll tell you things
that must be done immediately.

741
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:32,680
This place is a scandal.

742
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:37,230
Thank you, Dr. Guerra.
I'll get in touch with you.

743
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,970
Hello, Jett.

744
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,890
- Howdy, Miss Leslie.
- How are you?

745
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:18,310
I'm doing good.

746
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:22,400
- You made some improvements.
- Do you like it?

747
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:23,810
It looks good.

748
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:33,660
It ain't much yet, but it's coming along.

749
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:36,240
I wouldn't have believed it.

750
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:37,700
Believed what?

751
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:42,210
Truthfully, I didn't expect this sort
of talent to be one of your virtues.

752
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:47,880
That's the first time I was ever accused
of having any of that.

753
01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:55,140
It really is nice, Jett. Real nice.

754
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:57,770
Someday...

755
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:00,940
I'll have a place
that no one will be ashamed of.

756
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:12,320
I cut them out of the newspaper.

757
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:15,830
I thought maybe they'd kind of
dress the place up a little bit.

758
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:18,040
Sweet of you.

759
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:32,340
Do you want to come on in here,
sit down and rest a minute?

760
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:33,680
Thank you.

761
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:47,650
Having kids seems to agree with you,
you know?

762
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,860
You're looking prettier than ever.

763
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,860
Just as good, anyway.

764
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:11,210
My goodness, and tea!

765
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:13,050
You like tea, don't you?

766
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:17,010
I love it. It seems down here everybody
drinks gallons of coffee.

767
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:19,350
I know.

768
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:39,660
Mind if I pay you
a rather personal compliment?

769
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,160
What is it?

770
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,540
You make a very excellent cup of tea.

771
01:22:50,710 --> 01:22:53,260
I do a lot of things in a pinch.

772
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,970
Do you like one lump or do you like two?

773
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:06,270
I think I'll take mine straight.

774
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:08,980
That's good enough for me.

775
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:19,490
That's not too good, is it?

776
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:22,410
When will you get married, Jett?

777
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:26,960
Don't you need somebody to help you
with this kind of responsibility?

778
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:32,250
When I get some time to look around,
I'll go back East and....

779
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:35,090
To Maryland, places like that.

780
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:40,220
You got any attractive sisters there that
might be interested in some poor people?

781
01:23:41,970 --> 01:23:43,970
Money isn't all, you know?

782
01:23:45,810 --> 01:23:47,730
Not when you've got it.

783
01:23:55,190 --> 01:23:57,190
The other people around here...

784
01:23:57,450 --> 01:24:00,410
why don't they help themselves
like you've done?

785
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:05,790
When you say " other people,"
what do you mean?

786
01:24:10,290 --> 01:24:12,750
I've just come back from Vientecito.

787
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:15,500
That bunch of wetbacks?

788
01:24:16,130 --> 01:24:18,970
You don't go mixing me up
with none of them.

789
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:24,470
I'm just as much of Texas
as Bick Benedict is.

790
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:31,020
- I'm no wetback.
- I know that.

791
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:37,400
You're very like Jordan in that respect.
Attitude, everything.

792
01:24:38,570 --> 01:24:41,910
But your situation is so different.
You're a working man.

793
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,620
That's something I'm gonna try to fix.

794
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,750
Someday I will.

795
01:24:52,330 --> 01:24:53,630
All right, Gomez.

796
01:24:58,130 --> 01:24:59,590
Yes, I understand.

797
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,220
Yes, thank you.

798
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:06,350
Thanks for the tea party, Jett.

799
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:09,180
And don't be such a stranger.

800
01:25:11,730 --> 01:25:13,690
Stop by and pay us a visit.

801
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:16,690
I don't know about that.

802
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:19,190
Bick's still got his kettle on for me.

803
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:40,590
Leslie.

804
01:25:42,050 --> 01:25:43,380
Hello, darling.

805
01:25:45,430 --> 01:25:47,470
I was just having tea with Jett Rink.

806
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:50,560
Gomez telephoned.
"Mrs. Benedict went to Vientecito.

807
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:53,060
"I hope you're not displeased," he said.

808
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:56,110
I've told you before....
What's this about Jett Rink?

809
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:59,610
He made tea. Isn't that unbelievable?

810
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:02,530
He does so want to improve himself.

811
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:07,330
But your man Gomez, that camp he runs....

812
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:10,330
It's hopeless.

813
01:26:10,410 --> 01:26:13,540
You can't go around this place
with no regard for who you are...

814
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:15,370
interfering with those people.

815
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:18,000
Jordan, that place is a scandal.

816
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:20,880
Dr. Guerra threw his hands up in horror.

817
01:26:21,090 --> 01:26:22,760
That's his problem.

818
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:26,680
You've been a powerful Texan for
100 years. Why don't you do something?

819
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:28,800
I'm not the Red Cross, I'm a cow man.

820
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:30,560
If you won't, I will.

821
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:32,560
If you go near those dumps again...

822
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:35,520
if I ever hear you get mixed up
in this migratory mess...

823
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,020
- What?
- I'll leave you!

824
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:39,520
That's what I'll do, I'll leave you!

825
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:46,110
There's my darling little girl.

826
01:26:47,070 --> 01:26:51,410
Did you think your naughty mama was
never going to come up to see you?

827
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,040
One thing you can be sure of:

828
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:57,670
One of these days I'll run
that Jett Rink's hide out of this country.

829
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:25,440
Say hello to Luz. Say, " Hello, Luz."

830
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:31,240
Look there. Say hello to little Luz.

831
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:38,210
I don't care what you say.
She does look like Luz.

832
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:40,210
Oh, honey.

833
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:45,130
We're all gathered for the fourth
anniversary of my son's birth.

834
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:47,380
And your daughter's.

835
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:52,560
And I want to take
this auspicious occasion...

836
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:55,560
to say that this young fellow here...

837
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:59,310
is gonna grow up to be
one of Reata's top hands.

838
01:28:01,810 --> 01:28:04,320
I mean, this boy's gonna be the best.

839
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:09,160
Maybe he'll even grow up
to be better than his old man.

840
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:11,570
Girls, look at the pony.

841
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:20,330
There he is, son.

842
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,380
He's all yours.

843
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,420
All mine, Daddy?

844
01:28:47,190 --> 01:28:48,690
Take him around, Angel.

845
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,380
Take it easy, son.

846
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,250
He doesn't want to.

847
01:29:04,420 --> 01:29:06,420
I rode before I could walk.

848
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:10,720
But that was you.
He's another person entirely.

849
01:29:11,090 --> 01:29:15,810
He is a Benedict. He's gonna stay
on that saddle if I have to tie him on.

850
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:35,200
Take him away.

851
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:41,210
- No.
- Let him ride, Polo.

852
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:43,460
Let him ride.

853
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:56,600
Take him up for his nap.
I think he's tired.

854
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:37,930
That wasn't so bad, was it, son?

855
01:31:05,830 --> 01:31:09,960
Bick knows everything about running
a ranch. Bone, hide and hair.

856
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:14,340
He doesn't know a thing
about raising kids...

857
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:16,340
any more than his father did.

858
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:18,840
You just stay with it your way...

859
01:31:19,390 --> 01:31:22,850
and help those children grow up to be
what they want to be.

860
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:25,390
I will, Uncle Bawley. I promise.

861
01:31:30,270 --> 01:31:32,270
We're going to hit the hay.

862
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:38,780
- Good night, Leslie.
- Good night.

863
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:43,330
- Good night.
- Good night.

864
01:31:49,790 --> 01:31:51,540
It's time for me to turn in.

865
01:31:55,550 --> 01:31:58,800
- Good night, Bick.
- Good night, Bawley.

866
01:32:03,010 --> 01:32:06,520
Good night, everybody.
Don't forget to turn off the rain.

867
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:35,590
Are you tired?

868
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:37,800
No.

869
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:46,270
What's happening is we're getting
on each other's nerves.

870
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:47,600
Could be.

871
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:54,400
We've been together every day and night
since we first met.

872
01:32:55,940 --> 01:32:57,280
Is that bad?

873
01:32:58,740 --> 01:32:59,740
No.

874
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,950
We're getting in the habit
of snapping at each other...

875
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:11,120
about things
we should've adjusted to years ago.

876
01:33:18,130 --> 01:33:22,800
I think it would be a good idea
if I took the children home for a visit.

877
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:25,300
Home?

878
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:31,890
If you're homesick....

879
01:33:32,810 --> 01:33:35,150
I mean, if that's the way you want it.

880
01:33:35,940 --> 01:33:38,900
- That's not the way I want it, Jordan.
- All right, then.

881
01:33:44,530 --> 01:33:47,540
It'll be better for us
if we're apart for a while.

882
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:51,000
Better for us and the children.

883
01:33:53,330 --> 01:33:56,460
It'll give us both a chance
to think things over.

884
01:34:06,550 --> 01:34:08,180
You know best, I guess.

885
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:11,680
I think it will be best.

886
01:35:03,070 --> 01:35:04,530
- Hi, there.
- 'Morning.

887
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:06,530
Fine day for riding.

888
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:08,200
Just magnificent.

889
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:11,870
See you later.

890
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,540
She's a lucky girl.

891
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:21,250
If I had it to do again,
I'd still walk off with Jordan.

892
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:24,130
Even if I knew it'd end like this.

893
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:28,800
You have no time to be homesick...

894
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:31,850
with this wedding and Thanksgiving
on us together.

895
01:35:35,310 --> 01:35:36,980
Pedro, come here.

896
01:35:40,690 --> 01:35:43,030
Pedro, eat your dinner like a good boy.

897
01:36:13,010 --> 01:36:17,770
Merciful Father, we bow our heads
in gratitude on this Thanksgiving Day.

898
01:36:18,770 --> 01:36:22,270
We give thee humble and hearty thanks
for this, thy bounty...

899
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:25,940
beseeching thee to continue
thy loving kindness...

900
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:31,780
that our land may still yield her increase,
to thy glory and our comfort.

901
01:36:32,490 --> 01:36:33,490
Amen.

902
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Is that Pedro?

903
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:43,540
Yes, darling.

904
01:37:26,670 --> 01:37:29,010
It's a day
when we're supposed to be happy.

905
01:37:31,010 --> 01:37:32,640
Come on now, smile.

906
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:34,640
Like Mommy.

907
01:37:44,110 --> 01:37:45,860
Is something wrong, Miss Leslie?

908
01:37:55,780 --> 01:37:57,950
Now maybe you'll stop crying.

909
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:01,290
It's a message to you from your father.

910
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:03,830
Is he gonna be here for dinner?

911
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:07,590
No...

912
01:38:08,630 --> 01:38:12,430
but he says,
"I hope my darlings are all very happy.

913
01:38:13,630 --> 01:38:18,310
"I want them to know I miss them
very much and love each one very much."

914
01:39:02,180 --> 01:39:06,440
I could see you coming.
Why, Mr. Benedict, this is a good surprise!

915
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:11,780
We're having a wedding.
Sure is plenty of excitement.

916
01:40:18,510 --> 01:40:20,180
"Dearly beloved...

917
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:25,020
"we are gathered here in the sight of God
and in the face of this company...

918
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:30,190
"to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony...

919
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:34,780
"which is an honorable estate
instituted of God.

920
01:40:35,940 --> 01:40:40,110
"David, wilt thou have this woman
for thy wedded wife?

921
01:40:40,450 --> 01:40:45,120
"To live together after God's ordinance
in the holiest state of matrimony?

922
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:49,290
"Wilt thou love her, comfort her,
honor her...

923
01:40:49,670 --> 01:40:54,340
"and keep her in sickness and in health,
and forsaking all others...

924
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:59,300
"keep thee only unto her
so long as you both shall live?"

925
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:01,300
I will.

926
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:05,930
"Lacey, wilt thou have this man
for thy wedded husband...

927
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:11,100
"to live together after God's ordinance
in the holiest state of matrimony?

928
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:16,030
"Wilt thou love him, comfort him,
honor him...

929
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:21,410
"and keep him in sickness and in health,
and forsaking all others...

930
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:26,370
"keep thee only unto him
so long as you both shall live?"

931
01:41:26,450 --> 01:41:27,450
I will.

932
01:41:27,950 --> 01:41:30,290
"Bless, O Lord, this ring...

933
01:41:30,710 --> 01:41:35,380
"that he who gives it and she
who wears it may abide in thy peace...

934
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:40,050
"and continue in thy favor
unto their life's end.

935
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:41,300
"Amen."

936
01:41:45,810 --> 01:41:47,890
With this ring, I thee wed.

937
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:55,150
"Those whom God hath joined together,
let no man put asunder.

938
01:41:56,480 --> 01:42:01,900
"For as much as David and Lacey have
consented together in holy wedlock...

939
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:07,410
"I pronounce that they are man and wife."

940
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:43,820
Are you ready to come back
to your old, beat-up cowhand?

941
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:49,790
I'm no different than I was when I left.

942
01:42:51,450 --> 01:42:55,000
We Texans like a little vinegar
with our greens. It gives them flavor.

943
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:28,030
What do you think of old King Tut?

944
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:30,200
Boy, howdy, that's some hunk of beef!

945
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:31,830
He's gonna make history, too.

946
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:35,370
When Bick finishes this breeding program,
he'll have an animal...

947
01:43:35,670 --> 01:43:38,710
that's 99 percent beef
and the rest exaggeration.

948
01:44:39,650 --> 01:44:42,320
Say, Ollie, do you see that?

949
01:44:44,030 --> 01:44:45,570
That's Rink's truck.

950
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:48,320
I don't want him
hauling through my place.

951
01:44:49,610 --> 01:44:53,620
Jett's got the easement, Bick.
He's got a right to go through the land.

952
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:55,750
No two ways about that.

953
01:44:55,830 --> 01:44:58,500
I'm tired of his prospecting.
I want him out of here.

954
01:44:58,580 --> 01:45:02,420
He's borrowed about all he could.
He's down to his last collar button.

955
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:04,840
Sure he is.

956
01:45:06,170 --> 01:45:09,930
Buy him out, Ollie.
Buy him out and get him out of here.

957
01:46:12,780 --> 01:46:14,450
Hello, Jett.

958
01:46:14,530 --> 01:46:15,830
What do you want?

959
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,590
My well came in, Bick.

960
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:33,220
Fine.

961
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:37,350
That's wonderful, Jett.

962
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:41,350
Everybody thought I had a duster.

963
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:46,810
You all thought Spindletop and
Burkburnett was all the oil there was.

964
01:46:47,570 --> 01:46:50,780
I'm here to tell you it ain't, boy.
It's here.

965
01:46:52,190 --> 01:46:54,860
There ain't a dang thing
you gonna do about it.

966
01:46:55,110 --> 01:46:56,820
My well came in big, so big.

967
01:46:57,410 --> 01:46:59,790
And there's more down there,
bigger wells.

968
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:07,290
I'm rich, Bick!

969
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:13,630
I'm a rich one. I'm a rich boy.

970
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:18,890
I'm gonna have more money
than you ever thought you could have.

971
01:47:19,010 --> 01:47:21,640
You and the rest of you
stinking sons of Benedicts.

972
01:47:23,230 --> 01:47:26,190
Leslie, go into the house.
Take the women with you.

973
01:47:26,730 --> 01:47:28,730
Jett, we're glad you struck oil.

974
01:47:29,770 --> 01:47:31,360
Now, you go on along home.

975
01:47:33,690 --> 01:47:36,360
My, you sure do look pretty, Miss Leslie.

976
01:47:38,450 --> 01:47:40,280
You always did look pretty.

977
01:47:41,740 --> 01:47:43,450
Pretty, good enough to eat.

978
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,540
Wait a minute.

979
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,550
Take it easy!

980
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:57,050
You're touchy, Bick.

981
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:00,470
Touchy as an old cook.

982
01:48:18,860 --> 01:48:21,780
You should have shot him a long time ago.

983
01:48:21,870 --> 01:48:23,620
Now he's too rich to kill.

984
01:49:10,020 --> 01:49:12,860
Tell your client that Reata is my property.

985
01:49:12,940 --> 01:49:15,240
And the name of Reata is my property.

986
01:49:15,570 --> 01:49:17,700
The Texas courts are fair.

987
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:21,910
He is to cease using the name of my ranch
in his oil schemes.

988
01:49:22,030 --> 01:49:25,910
I won't have oil digging on Reata.
I won't stand for its name being used.

989
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:27,290
Is that clear?

990
01:49:56,650 --> 01:49:57,650
Mom?

991
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:01,410
Mother?

992
01:50:17,090 --> 01:50:20,010
They say Aunt Luz was really in love
with Jett Rink herself.

993
01:50:20,090 --> 01:50:22,600
Even if she was old enough
to be his mother.

994
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:23,850
Now, Luz....

995
01:50:23,930 --> 01:50:25,890
She was a character.

996
01:50:26,350 --> 01:50:29,020
She was always trying to keep him
from getting married.

997
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:31,100
He had to run off to marry you.

998
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:32,520
What's that?

999
01:50:33,270 --> 01:50:34,520
Who said what?

1000
01:50:35,190 --> 01:50:36,650
Somebody. I forget.

1001
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:43,320
You know what they say?

1002
01:50:43,700 --> 01:50:47,450
That every girl in Texas was trying
to catch Papa.

1003
01:50:48,450 --> 01:50:49,710
They said, quote:

1004
01:50:49,830 --> 01:50:53,330
"There wasn't a prize bull like him
since Sam Houston got married."

1005
01:50:54,210 --> 01:50:55,500
That's enough from her.

1006
01:50:56,800 --> 01:51:01,090
I'm sure it's quite true, darling.
It took me two whole days to land him.

1007
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:07,720
Really? It all sounds so fascinating
and uncouth.

1008
01:51:31,250 --> 01:51:32,420
Where are you going?

1009
01:51:33,750 --> 01:51:36,210
Down the road to Smitty's for Coke.

1010
01:51:36,340 --> 01:51:37,340
With who?

1011
01:51:37,550 --> 01:51:38,550
Nobody.

1012
01:51:39,630 --> 01:51:40,800
Stay at home.

1013
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:46,600
Hey, you!

1014
01:51:51,770 --> 01:51:52,770
Hello, Papa.

1015
01:51:54,270 --> 01:51:55,270
Hi.

1016
01:51:56,110 --> 01:51:57,270
Where have you been?

1017
01:51:57,360 --> 01:51:59,150
Down the road for a Coke.

1018
01:51:59,610 --> 01:52:00,610
With who?

1019
01:52:00,740 --> 01:52:01,740
Bob.

1020
01:52:06,780 --> 01:52:09,200
- Howdy, Mr. Benedict.
- Hello, Bob.

1021
01:52:11,870 --> 01:52:14,000
Well, good night, Mr. Benedict.

1022
01:52:14,330 --> 01:52:15,960
Excuse me, Papa.

1023
01:52:29,390 --> 01:52:31,640
Look, Papa, are you busy now?

1024
01:52:32,180 --> 01:52:34,480
Never too busy for you, young fellow.

1025
01:52:35,390 --> 01:52:37,100
What's on your mind?

1026
01:52:37,610 --> 01:52:39,730
Well, Daddy, it's like this.

1027
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,280
I am, Mama. I'm going to be.

1028
01:52:42,990 --> 01:52:45,990
I want to go to Harvard
and then to Columbia premed.

1029
01:52:47,910 --> 01:52:49,700
So you want to be a doctor?

1030
01:52:50,490 --> 01:52:51,490
Yes.

1031
01:52:54,750 --> 01:52:58,420
How about Reata, Jordy?
He's counting on you to take over.

1032
01:53:00,290 --> 01:53:02,590
Yes, I know he is. I know it.

1033
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:07,090
But there are 50,000 guys who can do it
better than I can.

1034
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:10,600
I don't want to live my life
pushing cows around.

1035
01:53:13,140 --> 01:53:15,520
I'd die for Papa if I had to.

1036
01:53:16,190 --> 01:53:20,150
Your father doesn't want you to die
for him. He wants you to live for him.

1037
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:22,440
Talk to her, will you, Daddy?

1038
01:53:23,690 --> 01:53:24,990
Reason with her.

1039
01:53:26,860 --> 01:53:28,490
I don't want this pinned on me.

1040
01:53:28,610 --> 01:53:30,410
I'll take all the blame.

1041
01:53:30,740 --> 01:53:33,830
You just sort of soften
the blow a little bit.

1042
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:36,660
I'll talk to him myself.

1043
01:53:36,870 --> 01:53:39,330
You can persuade him, Mom.
I know you can.

1044
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:42,000
It's not gonna be easy, honey.

1045
01:53:45,050 --> 01:53:47,180
Maybe I can catch her at a weak moment.

1046
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:50,220
You can do it, Daddy. I know you can.

1047
01:53:55,810 --> 01:53:58,020
Darling, I've been thinking....

1048
01:53:59,190 --> 01:54:00,270
Me, too.

1049
01:54:03,730 --> 01:54:05,280
About the children.

1050
01:54:06,690 --> 01:54:08,570
That's funny. Me, too.

1051
01:54:13,990 --> 01:54:15,620
We must be getting old.

1052
01:54:16,330 --> 01:54:17,790
Speak for yourself.

1053
01:54:21,330 --> 01:54:25,550
I wonder if we love them enough
to do what's really right for them.

1054
01:54:26,380 --> 01:54:27,920
Why, sure.

1055
01:54:30,930 --> 01:54:32,090
I hope so.

1056
01:54:34,350 --> 01:54:35,430
I mean...

1057
01:54:36,770 --> 01:54:39,230
so we love them too much perhaps.

1058
01:54:40,230 --> 01:54:43,900
So much that we keep from doing
what's right for them.

1059
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:46,320
Not me.

1060
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:51,320
You don't have to worry about me.

1061
01:54:57,750 --> 01:54:59,040
It's always the mother.

1062
01:55:01,370 --> 01:55:05,420
The theory is she doesn't want
her fledglings to leave her nest.

1063
01:55:08,260 --> 01:55:12,220
Try their own wings.
All that sort of stuff.

1064
01:55:15,390 --> 01:55:16,600
You mean...

1065
01:55:18,220 --> 01:55:20,810
you'd be perfectly willing to sacrifice?

1066
01:55:22,650 --> 01:55:23,650
Yeah.

1067
01:55:25,770 --> 01:55:28,610
I'd sacrifice for her. You know that.

1068
01:55:49,670 --> 01:55:52,510
I'm not so sold on that...

1069
01:55:54,340 --> 01:55:57,350
girl's school in Switzerland
you're stuck on.

1070
01:55:57,600 --> 01:55:59,560
Now, don't get your feathers up.

1071
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:02,730
Judy's not crazy about that school either.

1072
01:56:02,850 --> 01:56:05,860
Of course she isn't.
That's exactly why she needs to go.

1073
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:08,650
I wouldn't push her.

1074
01:56:12,110 --> 01:56:13,200
She...

1075
01:56:14,530 --> 01:56:16,490
wants to go to Texas Tech.

1076
01:56:16,700 --> 01:56:18,410
That's a man's school.

1077
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:20,500
Girls go, too.

1078
01:56:21,370 --> 01:56:24,870
It's got the best animal husbandry course
in the country, she says.

1079
01:56:31,300 --> 01:56:34,050
She wants to be a rancher,
like her old man.

1080
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:36,680
Like Bob Dace.

1081
01:56:37,470 --> 01:56:42,180
She's just got her little schoolgirl crush
on that hulking Bob Dace.

1082
01:56:43,100 --> 01:56:46,190
She's got her mind set on it.

1083
01:56:47,230 --> 01:56:48,690
That's what she wants.

1084
01:56:49,980 --> 01:56:52,490
And I, for one, am willing to sacrifice.

1085
01:57:20,600 --> 01:57:21,850
What do you say?

1086
01:57:27,100 --> 01:57:30,270
It seems we've hatched
an odd pair of fledglings.

1087
01:57:35,900 --> 01:57:37,200
Brace yourself.

1088
01:57:37,950 --> 01:57:39,990
Jordy wants to be a doctor.

1089
01:57:42,950 --> 01:57:43,950
He wants what?

1090
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:46,250
He wants to be a doctor.
He's absolutely set on it.

1091
01:57:46,370 --> 01:57:49,040
Over my dead body!
You know what he's supposed to do.

1092
01:57:49,130 --> 01:57:50,210
Well, he's not.

1093
01:57:51,290 --> 01:57:55,510
He'd die for you, but he's not gonna
live his life for you. And he's right.

1094
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:57,630
He'll do as we've all done.

1095
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:03,970
He wants to go to Harvard first,
then Columbia premed.

1096
01:58:06,430 --> 01:58:08,730
You're pretty handy with those terms.

1097
01:58:10,060 --> 01:58:12,570
I can see who's been cooking this thing up.

1098
01:58:18,740 --> 01:58:19,820
Of course...

1099
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:23,870
this would mean a big sacrifice
on your part.

1100
01:58:42,390 --> 01:58:45,060
No matter where he goes to school...

1101
01:58:46,220 --> 01:58:48,890
he comes right back home and runs Reata.

1102
01:58:55,820 --> 01:58:58,320
I guess you were right about one thing.

1103
01:59:00,990 --> 01:59:02,110
Me?

1104
01:59:03,070 --> 01:59:04,240
On one thing.

1105
01:59:06,740 --> 01:59:08,450
We are getting old.

1106
01:59:09,830 --> 01:59:10,830
Who?

1107
01:59:11,250 --> 01:59:12,460
We are, Jordan.

1108
01:59:15,670 --> 01:59:17,630
We are the older generation.

1109
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:20,840
Aren't we?

1110
01:59:21,970 --> 01:59:23,050
Suddenly?

1111
01:59:31,350 --> 01:59:32,650
I guess so.

1112
01:59:46,240 --> 01:59:49,250
"unless oil or gas shall have
been struck at a lesser depth."

1113
01:59:49,330 --> 01:59:51,620
Is that about Vashti Hake's ranch?

1114
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:54,920
Yes.

1115
01:59:56,710 --> 01:59:57,710
Good.

1116
01:59:58,710 --> 01:59:59,760
How about Reata?

1117
02:00:00,630 --> 02:00:03,970
No. That Benedict is a hard guy to crack.

1118
02:00:11,730 --> 02:00:14,020
Let's just keep punching, boys.

1119
02:00:48,550 --> 02:00:49,640
Hospital!

1120
02:00:50,100 --> 02:00:51,640
What's he covering up now?

1121
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:55,650
He'll overstep the mark one of these days.

1122
02:00:56,020 --> 02:00:57,230
Give him enough rope.

1123
02:00:58,150 --> 02:01:00,610
Give him enough rope, and he'll hang you.

1124
02:01:02,610 --> 02:01:03,610
I'll get it.

1125
02:01:08,070 --> 02:01:09,240
Hello.

1126
02:01:12,620 --> 02:01:14,410
No, this is her daughter.

1127
02:01:19,710 --> 02:01:22,170
You'll have to find out for yourself.

1128
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:26,260
- Take your social life on the other phone.
- It's for you.

1129
02:01:26,470 --> 02:01:27,930
I think he's nice.

1130
02:01:28,010 --> 02:01:29,640
- Who's nice?
- Jett Rink.

1131
02:01:32,430 --> 02:01:33,810
I don't want to talk to him.

1132
02:01:33,930 --> 02:01:35,310
What do I tell him?

1133
02:01:35,940 --> 02:01:38,600
Let me talk. I'll tell him.

1134
02:01:39,150 --> 02:01:40,520
I'll talk to him.

1135
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:49,700
You've heard from me before on this, Jett.

1136
02:01:50,120 --> 02:01:52,540
Judge Whiteside told you, and I told you.

1137
02:01:52,700 --> 02:01:56,830
This is a cattle ranch, not an oil field.
That's the way it's gonna stay.

1138
02:01:59,750 --> 02:02:02,750
That's about the most expensive
phone call you ever made, Bick.

1139
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:05,970
It'll cost you a billion dollars a year
for the next 50 years.

1140
02:02:06,090 --> 02:02:10,470
Couldn't we have just one little, itty-bitty
oil well, so I can get a private phone?

1141
02:02:27,700 --> 02:02:32,160
<i>After reporting to President Roosevelt,
the Naval Secretary told the press...</i>

1142
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:36,330
<i>that the battleship Arizona
and five other warships were lost...</i>

1143
02:02:36,450 --> 02:02:41,170
<i>in the Japanese air raid
on Pearl Harbor a fortnight ago.</i>

1144
02:02:42,210 --> 02:02:44,340
<i>He reported that 91 officers...</i>

1145
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:49,010
<i>and 2,638 enlisted men were known dead.</i>

1146
02:02:55,470 --> 02:02:58,310
That only makes me realize I'm losing you.

1147
02:04:23,020 --> 02:04:24,480
Here they are.

1148
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:29,280
When did you two sneak in?

1149
02:04:29,530 --> 02:04:31,150
The honeymooners!

1150
02:04:37,330 --> 02:04:40,240
Judy, you're gonna get it.
You know Mom wanted a big wedding.

1151
02:04:40,370 --> 02:04:42,160
That's not true, Luz.

1152
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:45,960
Not quite true.

1153
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:23,080
We came for you to see Angel.

1154
02:05:24,370 --> 02:05:26,830
He's the first soldier from Reata.

1155
02:05:27,210 --> 02:05:30,040
- Merry Christmas, Polo.
- Merry Christmas.

1156
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:37,010
Isn't he a fine-looking soldier?

1157
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:40,100
Just a minute.

1158
02:05:45,060 --> 02:05:47,020
Merry Christmas, Angel.

1159
02:05:47,150 --> 02:05:48,150
Thank you.

1160
02:05:48,350 --> 02:05:52,190
Today the wish of all of us is
that the war ends quickly...

1161
02:05:52,940 --> 02:05:56,280
and that you, Angel,
return safely to Reata...

1162
02:05:57,860 --> 02:06:00,870
and to all of those
who love you very much.

1163
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:03,370
I'll drink a toast to that.

1164
02:06:05,580 --> 02:06:07,540
Come on, now, and open it.

1165
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:37,950
- Hello, Dr. Guerra.
- Hello, Dr. Benedict.

1166
02:06:38,610 --> 02:06:40,570
Just a little premature.

1167
02:06:40,660 --> 02:06:41,910
I know, it takes time.

1168
02:06:42,700 --> 02:06:44,580
Jordan, this is Juana.

1169
02:06:45,950 --> 02:06:48,620
She's been training out at the hospital.

1170
02:06:51,750 --> 02:06:54,420
It must be that darn north wind static.

1171
02:06:56,300 --> 02:07:01,180
Don't tell me you haven't learned that
dry wind, friction, and a heavy carpet...

1172
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:05,260
are not the only means of creating
electricity between human beings.

1173
02:07:20,360 --> 02:07:21,410
Thank you.

1174
02:07:27,040 --> 02:07:30,120
Could you stay and give me the lowdown
on what it's like?

1175
02:07:38,260 --> 02:07:40,630
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.

1176
02:07:41,130 --> 02:07:42,930
<i>- Goodbye.
- Adiós.</i>

1177
02:07:45,470 --> 02:07:48,980
- Let's get some Christmas cheer.
- You talked me into it!

1178
02:07:57,360 --> 02:08:00,860
Friends, we're gonna have
a mighty triumphant Christmas.

1179
02:08:03,030 --> 02:08:06,200
I'm gonna drink a toast
to two young men of Reata.

1180
02:08:08,120 --> 02:08:09,200
My two sons.

1181
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:19,880
Thank you, Mr. Benedict.

1182
02:08:25,090 --> 02:08:27,760
Better take it easy on the bourbon, Dad.

1183
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:30,270
It's not good for you.

1184
02:08:31,390 --> 02:08:32,850
I'm not kidding you.

1185
02:08:38,820 --> 02:08:40,780
I hate to see Angel go.

1186
02:08:41,280 --> 02:08:44,610
That boy is the best dang man
on the place.

1187
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:54,790
It's time for you to take your place here,
to produce beef for the war.

1188
02:08:55,790 --> 02:08:59,130
They need doctors, Dad.
They need doctors in war, too.

1189
02:09:00,920 --> 02:09:03,380
I want to finish medical school if I can.

1190
02:09:04,340 --> 02:09:06,050
You are being bull-headed.

1191
02:09:07,600 --> 02:09:10,430
I never would be any good
at running this place.

1192
02:09:12,350 --> 02:09:14,480
Any man on Reata can do it better.

1193
02:09:14,730 --> 02:09:16,350
You're the one.

1194
02:09:17,770 --> 02:09:20,230
You're the one with a responsibility
to Reata.

1195
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:23,360
Your blood pressure is going up
just while we're talking here.

1196
02:09:24,780 --> 02:09:27,280
Please, it isn't good for you. Just relax.

1197
02:09:27,410 --> 02:09:29,370
Don't you get fresh with me.

1198
02:09:36,120 --> 02:09:37,580
We're talking.

1199
02:09:37,960 --> 02:09:39,420
Yes, I heard.

1200
02:09:40,460 --> 02:09:44,920
It's Christmas morning. Isn't this
something you could discuss tomorrow?

1201
02:09:46,550 --> 02:09:48,510
There's nothing to discuss.

1202
02:09:48,850 --> 02:09:52,350
When I come home,
I'll work with Dr. Guerra in Vientecito.

1203
02:09:55,270 --> 02:09:58,600
I love Texas as much as you do.
I want to work here.

1204
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:02,610
I just want to work in a different way,
that's all.

1205
02:10:04,280 --> 02:10:05,490
Come on, Jordan.

1206
02:10:07,530 --> 02:10:09,070
Work with Guerra!

1207
02:10:21,420 --> 02:10:23,130
Here's to you, Mr. Benedict.

1208
02:10:28,050 --> 02:10:30,090
You look beat, Mr. Benedict.

1209
02:10:30,220 --> 02:10:31,220
Here's to you.

1210
02:10:31,300 --> 02:10:33,010
It's pretty good stuff.

1211
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:35,560
Did you make that yourself?

1212
02:10:37,310 --> 02:10:39,270
Yes, I make it every year.

1213
02:10:40,900 --> 02:10:42,860
It's my Christmas special.

1214
02:10:43,400 --> 02:10:45,280
No, I mean the liquor.

1215
02:10:45,610 --> 02:10:47,570
Did you make the liquor yourself?

1216
02:10:48,030 --> 02:10:51,990
If not, it's about the only thing
you don't produce on Reata yourself.

1217
02:10:56,790 --> 02:10:58,410
Come here and sit down.

1218
02:10:59,120 --> 02:11:01,080
I've got some serious talk
to make with you.

1219
02:11:08,590 --> 02:11:12,090
I've been watching you pretty close
for a lot of years.

1220
02:11:16,850 --> 02:11:18,480
You're a ranchman.

1221
02:11:20,270 --> 02:11:21,900
And you're smart.

1222
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:33,740
You're wondering why I'm talking to you.

1223
02:11:41,580 --> 02:11:42,790
Bob Dace...

1224
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,460
look me right in the eye.

1225
02:11:49,380 --> 02:11:54,010
You could never be anything but a rancher,
could you?

1226
02:11:54,350 --> 02:11:55,970
- No, sir.
- That's my boy.

1227
02:11:56,140 --> 02:11:58,560
But somebody else thinks I could.

1228
02:12:00,600 --> 02:12:01,600
Not my Judy.

1229
02:12:01,690 --> 02:12:03,230
- No, sir, it's not Judy.
- Who?

1230
02:12:04,440 --> 02:12:06,150
President Roosevelt.

1231
02:12:09,190 --> 02:12:10,650
Listen to this:

1232
02:12:15,200 --> 02:12:17,330
"To Robert Haskell Dace.

1233
02:12:18,330 --> 02:12:22,460
"Greetings from the President
of the United States."

1234
02:12:22,620 --> 02:12:23,920
Let me see that.

1235
02:12:26,670 --> 02:12:30,800
"You are hereby notified to report
on December 28...

1236
02:12:31,130 --> 02:12:33,090
"5:00 a.m. for induction."

1237
02:12:39,100 --> 02:12:40,560
It don't matter.

1238
02:12:42,060 --> 02:12:44,520
Your job won't let you leave this place.

1239
02:12:44,850 --> 02:12:48,440
It'll make you stay right here. This
is just as important as carrying a gun.

1240
02:12:48,520 --> 02:12:50,780
I appreciate your confidence, sir.

1241
02:12:51,740 --> 02:12:55,160
But this is one thing
I'm not gonna try to get out of.

1242
02:12:58,910 --> 02:13:01,120
Have it your way. You might as well...

1243
02:13:01,950 --> 02:13:04,210
everybody else does around here.

1244
02:13:06,630 --> 02:13:10,130
I'll show you my heart's
in the right place.

1245
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:13,880
When you come back
after the war is over...

1246
02:13:14,760 --> 02:13:16,220
the job's yours.

1247
02:13:16,390 --> 02:13:18,350
It'll be waiting for you.

1248
02:13:20,310 --> 02:13:21,850
I couldn't take it, sir.

1249
02:13:21,970 --> 02:13:24,100
Papa, Bob and I have plans.

1250
02:13:26,310 --> 02:13:28,610
We want a place, just our own.

1251
02:13:31,650 --> 02:13:33,440
You crazy kids, you!

1252
02:13:35,820 --> 02:13:39,240
Can you imagine you'll ever have
anything like this? Like Reata?

1253
02:13:39,330 --> 02:13:42,160
Gosh, no, sir. We just want a little place.

1254
02:13:42,290 --> 02:13:46,830
Just a little place that'll allow us time
for experimentation and progress.

1255
02:13:46,920 --> 02:13:50,090
See, sir, big stuff is old stuff now.

1256
02:13:50,500 --> 02:13:52,460
Big stuff is old stuff?

1257
02:13:52,630 --> 02:13:57,090
Bob didn't mean to upset you.
He just wants to be honest, that's all.

1258
02:13:58,180 --> 02:14:02,010
We just want something little
that's our own. That's all.

1259
02:14:03,020 --> 02:14:04,480
Just ours.

1260
02:14:05,350 --> 02:14:06,810
You see, Dad?

1261
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:10,520
Yeah, honey, I see.

1262
02:14:13,900 --> 02:14:15,360
See you, Daddy.

1263
02:14:27,540 --> 02:14:30,210
Keeping it together all my life for them!

1264
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:34,170
I battled mesquite, dust, and the wind...

1265
02:14:34,920 --> 02:14:36,550
to keep it this big.

1266
02:14:37,550 --> 02:14:38,840
And for who?

1267
02:14:39,930 --> 02:14:43,260
I might just as well give it back
to the dirty Comanches!

1268
02:14:43,600 --> 02:14:45,060
That's the Christmas spirit.

1269
02:14:45,180 --> 02:14:47,640
Give it all back to the poor old Indians.

1270
02:14:53,270 --> 02:14:56,360
Don't tell me, I know. You're Jett Rink.

1271
02:14:59,700 --> 02:15:00,910
You're Judy.

1272
02:15:01,030 --> 02:15:02,330
No, I'm Luz.

1273
02:15:06,700 --> 02:15:07,790
That I am.

1274
02:15:07,910 --> 02:15:09,210
Come on in.

1275
02:15:16,420 --> 02:15:18,380
Dad's over at the bar.

1276
02:15:20,010 --> 02:15:22,850
Feel free, it's Christmas.
Everybody gets one.

1277
02:15:25,260 --> 02:15:26,560
Christmas?

1278
02:15:27,810 --> 02:15:31,560
I thought that was next week.
Somebody ought to have told me.

1279
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:36,440
Christmas greetings
from Mr. Jetexas himself.

1280
02:15:50,250 --> 02:15:51,290
Sit down.

1281
02:15:57,050 --> 02:16:00,720
I guess Christmas is as good a day as any
to talk business.

1282
02:16:03,850 --> 02:16:05,100
Run along, Luz.

1283
02:16:06,260 --> 02:16:08,390
We've got business to talk about.

1284
02:16:08,520 --> 02:16:09,600
'Bye, now.

1285
02:16:11,980 --> 02:16:13,440
'Bye, Mr. Rink.

1286
02:16:15,310 --> 02:16:17,610
Everybody calls me Jett, honey.

1287
02:16:24,660 --> 02:16:25,830
Bye-bye.

1288
02:16:34,880 --> 02:16:36,420
What's on your mind?

1289
02:16:36,540 --> 02:16:38,670
The country needs petroleum.

1290
02:16:39,510 --> 02:16:41,720
I'm going to Washington, Bick.

1291
02:16:42,300 --> 02:16:45,300
The reason I'm going
and the reason I'm here is oil.

1292
02:16:47,560 --> 02:16:48,850
I figured.

1293
02:16:50,480 --> 02:16:52,440
You want to talk a little business?

1294
02:16:53,100 --> 02:16:54,400
I'm ready.

1295
02:16:55,610 --> 02:16:58,940
It seems that every time we made a deal,
me and you...

1296
02:17:02,490 --> 02:17:04,860
it just turned out pretty lucky...

1297
02:17:06,200 --> 02:17:07,490
for somebody.

1298
02:17:43,240 --> 02:17:46,990
All this oil around here hasn't made
a lot of difference.

1299
02:17:48,030 --> 02:17:51,040
We live pretty much like we always have
here in Reata.

1300
02:17:52,120 --> 02:17:54,080
Just like we Benedicts found it.

1301
02:17:56,080 --> 02:18:00,210
The Lord was good to you, to set
the swimming pool in your own front yard.

1302
02:18:03,510 --> 02:18:05,130
Hey, come on in.

1303
02:18:06,090 --> 02:18:07,550
Not now, Luz.

1304
02:18:12,810 --> 02:18:15,180
It's good for the young folks.

1305
02:18:16,310 --> 02:18:19,310
We'd have made improvements
around here, oil or no oil.

1306
02:18:20,110 --> 02:18:23,940
But that 27.5 percent tax exemption
on oil helped, didn't it?

1307
02:18:26,320 --> 02:18:28,820
Bale, I'll tell you what old Pinky thinks.

1308
02:18:28,950 --> 02:18:29,700
What?

1309
02:18:29,780 --> 02:18:34,250
That oil tax exemption is the best thing
to hit Texas since we whooped Geronimo.

1310
02:18:42,670 --> 02:18:45,840
One of the finest laws ever passed
in Washington.

1311
02:18:46,840 --> 02:18:49,220
And all joking aside, Bick...

1312
02:18:49,590 --> 02:18:52,680
we're not adverse to accepting
a share of the credit for it.

1313
02:18:52,810 --> 02:18:54,060
Not at all.

1314
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:58,900
How about an exemption for depreciation
of first-class brains, Senator?

1315
02:18:59,190 --> 02:19:00,650
Whose? Yours?

1316
02:19:01,230 --> 02:19:05,690
My father's, for instance. He spent
his life saving other people's lives.

1317
02:19:06,690 --> 02:19:09,160
How about some tax exemption there?

1318
02:19:14,620 --> 02:19:18,040
Leslie has always been a real sharp talker,
ain't she?

1319
02:19:18,500 --> 02:19:22,340
Fair enough, Judge. You've always been
smooth enough for two.

1320
02:19:23,710 --> 02:19:27,420
"Do you take each other
for better or for worse...

1321
02:19:28,630 --> 02:19:30,760
"for richer or for poorer...

1322
02:19:31,640 --> 02:19:34,640
"in sickness and in health, until death?

1323
02:19:38,680 --> 02:19:42,020
"Jordan Benedict, wilt thou take...

1324
02:19:42,690 --> 02:19:44,730
"Juana Villalobos here present...

1325
02:19:45,650 --> 02:19:50,200
"for your lawful wife, according to
the rite of our Holy Mother the Church?"

1326
02:19:51,700 --> 02:19:52,700
I will.

1327
02:19:53,990 --> 02:19:57,080
"Juana Villalobos, wilt thou take...

1328
02:19:58,120 --> 02:20:00,330
"Jordan Benedict here present...

1329
02:20:00,500 --> 02:20:05,210
"for your lawful husband, according to
the rite of our Holy Mother the Church?"

1330
02:20:07,130 --> 02:20:08,130
I will.

1331
02:20:09,170 --> 02:20:11,470
Join your hands and kneel down.

1332
02:22:17,470 --> 02:22:19,100
What did they say?

1333
02:22:24,980 --> 02:22:26,600
<i>Friends and neighbors...</i>

1334
02:22:27,980 --> 02:22:29,940
<i>l want you all to meet my wife.</i>

1335
02:22:31,730 --> 02:22:33,360
<i>Mrs. Jordan Benedict III.</i>

1336
02:22:35,240 --> 02:22:36,320
Congratulations!

1337
02:23:54,150 --> 02:23:56,980
He was the first Reata baby I ever saw.

1338
02:23:58,740 --> 02:24:01,240
I remember it as if it were yesterday.

1339
02:24:03,830 --> 02:24:05,280
He had a fever.

1340
02:24:07,160 --> 02:24:10,330
I didn't think he was going
to live the day out.

1341
02:25:13,730 --> 02:25:18,690
On behalf of the U.S. Army, I am proud
to present to you the flag of our nation...

1342
02:25:19,230 --> 02:25:22,070
which your son defended so gallantly.

1343
02:27:39,210 --> 02:27:41,710
Everyone in the world's gonna be there.

1344
02:27:42,750 --> 02:27:45,760
I'm gonna fly up to Dallas,
and I'm going to Neiman's.

1345
02:27:46,130 --> 02:27:49,930
I'll buy myself
a starlight-white evening dress.

1346
02:27:50,550 --> 02:27:53,550
Very plain and simple and deadly.

1347
02:27:54,760 --> 02:27:56,930
Before you get so elaborate and simple...

1348
02:27:57,020 --> 02:27:59,440
you'd better hear
what your father has to say.

1349
02:27:59,560 --> 02:28:01,900
We're certainly going. I promised Jett.

1350
02:28:03,110 --> 02:28:06,190
Jett! What are you talking about?

1351
02:28:06,780 --> 02:28:11,410
He likes me. He likes my family, too.
He's always talking about you.

1352
02:28:13,320 --> 02:28:15,330
My dear, darling Luz...

1353
02:28:15,790 --> 02:28:19,870
if I didn't know you had a level Benedict
head on those immature shoulders...

1354
02:28:19,960 --> 02:28:22,130
I'd prescribe a good spanking.

1355
02:28:22,460 --> 02:28:25,500
He's dreamy. Ask the Snythe girls.

1356
02:28:25,800 --> 02:28:27,050
Ask anyone.

1357
02:28:27,170 --> 02:28:29,170
He's just a rough diamond.

1358
02:28:29,300 --> 02:28:33,550
He's a rough rhinestone.
He's old enough to be your father.

1359
02:28:35,260 --> 02:28:37,430
What are you six evil men up to now?

1360
02:28:37,520 --> 02:28:40,060
Honey, it's a coronation.

1361
02:28:40,690 --> 02:28:42,980
Jett plans to get himself crowned king.

1362
02:28:43,060 --> 02:28:45,570
You got to have $10 million
to be on the guest list.

1363
02:28:45,650 --> 02:28:48,440
The most important people
in the country will be there.

1364
02:28:48,530 --> 02:28:50,240
Coast-to-coast broadcast.

1365
02:28:50,320 --> 02:28:52,490
Jett's gonna make a magnificent speech.

1366
02:28:52,570 --> 02:28:53,570
I know.

1367
02:28:54,490 --> 02:28:56,490
I'm going to write it for him.

1368
02:28:56,580 --> 02:28:58,830
It'll be heard across the nation
by everyone.

1369
02:28:58,910 --> 02:29:01,870
Eliminating one. That's me.

1370
02:29:03,670 --> 02:29:08,170
If you people stay away, Leslie, you'll be
the only folks in Texas who ain't there.

1371
02:29:08,250 --> 02:29:10,260
You'll be roped in with the herd.

1372
02:29:10,340 --> 02:29:14,640
You'll be putting on your pink shoes and
dancing to Jett's fiddles like the rest of us.

1373
02:29:14,720 --> 02:29:17,010
If we go then we'll do it right.

1374
02:29:17,100 --> 02:29:21,890
We're oil rich, like the rest of them. We'll
go like the rest of them! Only better.

1375
02:29:21,980 --> 02:29:23,770
Now you're talking like my father.

1376
02:29:23,850 --> 02:29:25,480
The old Benedict spirit.

1377
02:29:25,560 --> 02:29:27,770
You set up one of your great weekends.

1378
02:29:27,860 --> 02:29:30,110
Invite everybody.
We'll take them all with us.

1379
02:29:30,190 --> 02:29:33,530
We'll show that so-and-so
who's top people around here.

1380
02:29:33,780 --> 02:29:35,950
I'll even buy the four-engine Douglas.

1381
02:29:36,240 --> 02:29:38,580
Fly in some orchids from Hawaii.

1382
02:29:40,200 --> 02:29:43,830
We'll fly in low and shake the tiles
off that hotel roof.

1383
02:30:44,770 --> 02:30:46,440
There's Lola Lane!

1384
02:30:46,520 --> 02:30:48,810
I bet even Hollywood isn't this exciting.

1385
02:30:48,900 --> 02:30:51,440
- Isn't this something?
- It's perfectly fabulous!

1386
02:30:51,520 --> 02:30:53,990
Jett always tries to do things
in a bigger way...

1387
02:30:54,070 --> 02:30:56,200
and spend more money than anybody else.

1388
02:30:56,280 --> 02:30:57,780
Really? What does he do?

1389
02:30:58,280 --> 02:31:01,120
To some folks, he's just
a no-good wildcatting so-and-so.

1390
02:31:20,220 --> 02:31:21,220
There he is.

1391
02:31:28,140 --> 02:31:30,150
There's the emperor himself.

1392
02:31:37,990 --> 02:31:41,490
Isn't this terrific?
Look at Luz, she's queen of the parade.

1393
02:31:42,070 --> 02:31:43,830
You didn't tell me.

1394
02:31:48,250 --> 02:31:50,250
Did you know about this, Leslie?

1395
02:31:52,170 --> 02:31:53,170
No, I didn't.

1396
02:31:59,680 --> 02:32:03,180
My daughter, queen of Jett Rink Day!
What is this?

1397
02:32:04,680 --> 02:32:06,350
I don't know, Jordan.

1398
02:32:07,770 --> 02:32:10,850
She's done things before I haven't
gone along with, but this....

1399
02:32:10,940 --> 02:32:12,810
She's never been sneaky.

1400
02:32:12,980 --> 02:32:16,150
It's not exactly sneaky,
appearing in a parade.

1401
02:32:16,230 --> 02:32:17,820
Don't try to be funny.

1402
02:32:18,190 --> 02:32:20,910
I'm not. I'm just as upset as you are.

1403
02:32:21,950 --> 02:32:25,790
But Luz is intelligent enough
not to be imposed on by him or anyone.

1404
02:32:26,040 --> 02:32:27,370
Give me the desk.

1405
02:32:28,370 --> 02:32:29,540
It's Bick Benedict.

1406
02:32:29,620 --> 02:32:32,080
Did my daughter
Luz Benedict come in yet?

1407
02:32:32,790 --> 02:32:35,710
Get this. As soon as she comes in,
have her call me.

1408
02:33:14,080 --> 02:33:16,250
You know what I think I'll do?

1409
02:33:18,710 --> 02:33:21,220
I'm going to keep it just like this.

1410
02:33:23,760 --> 02:33:26,600
I'll keep all those people, send them home.

1411
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:31,560
I'm not even gonna open up this place.

1412
02:33:34,850 --> 02:33:38,020
Some girls might like a hotel
all to themselves.

1413
02:33:39,070 --> 02:33:42,070
Me, I like company, Jett.
I like lots of people.

1414
02:33:44,780 --> 02:33:45,990
All right.

1415
02:33:47,330 --> 02:33:51,040
You want lots of people?
I don't see any problem there.

1416
02:33:55,790 --> 02:34:00,090
If there's anything you want,
just say it, and you've got it.

1417
02:34:03,880 --> 02:34:06,090
All right, I'd like a Coke.

1418
02:34:10,140 --> 02:34:13,230
No, that's impossible.
That's just impossible.

1419
02:34:14,100 --> 02:34:17,940
You know as well as I do, Cokes are taboo.
All soft drinks.

1420
02:34:20,820 --> 02:34:22,440
You make the rules.

1421
02:34:27,820 --> 02:34:30,490
You like things your own way, don't you?

1422
02:34:31,540 --> 02:34:33,540
Let me ask you something.

1423
02:34:34,620 --> 02:34:39,130
Do you like things your way?
Not many people have things their way.

1424
02:34:40,420 --> 02:34:43,090
No, I don't get them my way very often.

1425
02:34:47,300 --> 02:34:50,300
And you won't either,
until you get married...

1426
02:34:52,930 --> 02:34:55,810
and get your man
to give you what you want.

1427
02:34:55,890 --> 02:34:56,890
So?

1428
02:34:58,230 --> 02:35:01,570
So if I was you,
I'd start thinking about getting married.

1429
02:35:02,900 --> 02:35:04,780
You know, that's an idea.

1430
02:35:12,200 --> 02:35:15,040
You looked like a queen
in that parade today.

1431
02:35:16,160 --> 02:35:17,670
That was my job.

1432
02:35:28,550 --> 02:35:30,390
It's just what you are.

1433
02:35:31,100 --> 02:35:33,060
Luz Benedict ll.

1434
02:35:35,640 --> 02:35:39,600
You could be the head lady
of this part of the whole country...

1435
02:35:40,730 --> 02:35:43,940
if you wanted to.
If you married the right man.

1436
02:35:45,490 --> 02:35:46,990
That's a sweet idea.

1437
02:35:49,410 --> 02:35:52,070
Why don't I just announce it tonight...

1438
02:35:52,370 --> 02:35:55,540
with all them thousands
of people listening?

1439
02:35:58,040 --> 02:35:59,500
The whole of Texas.

1440
02:36:01,880 --> 02:36:04,210
Wouldn't that blow the roof off?

1441
02:36:08,970 --> 02:36:10,970
Jett, tell me something.

1442
02:36:15,310 --> 02:36:16,850
Is this a proposal?

1443
02:36:16,930 --> 02:36:18,560
Does it sound like one?

1444
02:36:21,440 --> 02:36:23,770
After a fashion, but not quite.

1445
02:36:27,860 --> 02:36:30,860
You want me to say something
you can laugh at?

1446
02:36:33,280 --> 02:36:34,280
No.

1447
02:36:37,500 --> 02:36:40,160
I just think you're a wonderful girl.

1448
02:36:41,620 --> 02:36:44,090
And I do think you're beautiful.

1449
02:36:48,010 --> 02:36:52,090
You're fascinating to me.
I've always been looking for...

1450
02:36:52,930 --> 02:36:54,390
a girl like you.

1451
02:37:06,520 --> 02:37:09,360
Sure would blow the roof off, wouldn't it?

1452
02:37:13,660 --> 02:37:15,990
You've got a long way to go tonight.

1453
02:37:21,540 --> 02:37:24,210
I'm very flattered. Any girl would be.

1454
02:37:30,260 --> 02:37:32,090
You be a good boy now.

1455
02:37:33,760 --> 02:37:35,180
I'll see you later.

1456
02:38:39,780 --> 02:38:42,750
I hope this storm doesn't louse up
your party.

1457
02:38:42,830 --> 02:38:46,790
A slip-up, boy. I just forgot
to order the right kind of weather!

1458
02:38:47,290 --> 02:38:48,630
I heard a twister hit Waco.

1459
02:39:07,060 --> 02:39:09,730
What's wrong with you?
Can't you talk United States?

1460
02:39:09,810 --> 02:39:11,320
You're talking to my wife.

1461
02:39:11,980 --> 02:39:15,320
I'm Jordan Benedict,
if that means anything to you.

1462
02:39:15,740 --> 02:39:17,700
I'm just following orders.

1463
02:39:18,030 --> 02:39:21,240
Mr. Rink said he'd have my neck
if I let any of the wrong people in.

1464
02:39:29,540 --> 02:39:32,920
You Benedicts are all close together.
They've got the Coronado suite.

1465
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:34,460
You're in the Filando suite.

1466
02:39:34,550 --> 02:39:37,340
I'm a mess. I must go to the beauty parlor.

1467
02:39:37,430 --> 02:39:39,430
Hurry before they close.

1468
02:39:39,720 --> 02:39:43,890
<i>Grand opening of the Jett Rink Airport
and Emperador Hotel...</i>

1469
02:39:44,350 --> 02:39:48,520
<i>is the latest milestone in the dramatic
life of this virile son of Texas.</i>

1470
02:39:51,270 --> 02:39:52,400
Howdy, everybody!

1471
02:39:56,110 --> 02:39:58,320
- It's time you got here.
- Where are the boys?

1472
02:39:58,400 --> 02:39:59,990
Where's Pinky, the old bat?

1473
02:40:00,950 --> 02:40:02,950
Filando suite for Mr. Benedict, please.

1474
02:40:03,870 --> 02:40:05,160
<i>Beauty salon.</i>

1475
02:40:05,240 --> 02:40:06,580
Can you take me?

1476
02:40:07,710 --> 02:40:09,670
<i>Yes, if you can come right along.</i>

1477
02:40:09,750 --> 02:40:11,830
Thank goodness. I'll be right in.

1478
02:40:11,920 --> 02:40:14,170
<i>- Who's calling, please?
- Mrs. Benedict.</i>

1479
02:40:14,550 --> 02:40:16,550
<i>Come on along, Mrs. Benedict.</i>

1480
02:40:16,630 --> 02:40:17,670
Thank you.

1481
02:40:20,130 --> 02:40:22,760
Keep everybody freshened up, will you?
We'll be quick.

1482
02:40:22,850 --> 02:40:26,310
We're anxious to see old Jett come out
in that suit.

1483
02:40:29,390 --> 02:40:32,940
Why couldn't they ride with us
like other people's kids do?

1484
02:40:33,020 --> 02:40:36,650
Luz had to fly her own plane
and Jordy and Juana had to drive.

1485
02:41:00,220 --> 02:41:01,720
Is anybody here?

1486
02:41:06,140 --> 02:41:07,720
We're all booked up.

1487
02:41:07,810 --> 02:41:10,310
I just called. I'm Mrs. Benedict.

1488
02:41:12,100 --> 02:41:14,110
I'm sorry, but we're busy.

1489
02:41:15,270 --> 02:41:17,110
I'll wait a little.

1490
02:41:24,870 --> 02:41:27,740
They're driving. It takes time.

1491
02:41:27,870 --> 02:41:29,870
I know it takes time.

1492
02:41:30,830 --> 02:41:32,920
I made the trip myself 500 times.

1493
02:41:36,130 --> 02:41:38,300
But don't worry about the children.

1494
02:41:38,380 --> 02:41:41,380
Their behavior is odd,
but their manners are beautiful.

1495
02:41:41,470 --> 02:41:42,970
Listen here, boy!

1496
02:41:43,050 --> 02:41:45,010
I've taken enough from you!

1497
02:41:45,180 --> 02:41:47,050
I didn't want to come here!

1498
02:41:47,140 --> 02:41:50,060
I wouldn't be here unless you let them
bully you into it.

1499
02:41:50,140 --> 02:41:52,640
Now, for heaven's sake,
let's make the best of it.

1500
02:41:52,730 --> 02:41:56,980
Cool down, go on with your shaving, finish
dressing, and I'll go downstairs with you!

1501
02:41:57,060 --> 02:41:59,150
Otherwise, you can go alone!

1502
02:42:00,650 --> 02:42:01,990
You know, honey...

1503
02:42:03,360 --> 02:42:05,780
you're awful cute when you get riled.

1504
02:42:13,750 --> 02:42:17,420
Hurry on in there.
Your ma and pa are sure having a battle.

1505
02:42:21,630 --> 02:42:22,720
Hello, honey.

1506
02:42:22,800 --> 02:42:24,090
Where have you been?

1507
02:42:24,220 --> 02:42:26,050
We got tied up in traffic.

1508
02:42:26,140 --> 02:42:27,220
Where's Juana?

1509
02:42:27,300 --> 02:42:29,600
She's in the beauty parlor.

1510
02:42:30,930 --> 02:42:33,140
Hello, sweetheart.

1511
02:42:34,140 --> 02:42:36,480
He's all right. He just didn't get his nap.

1512
02:42:38,230 --> 02:42:40,270
How's my child?

1513
02:42:41,360 --> 02:42:43,440
Is that Judy crying?

1514
02:43:04,050 --> 02:43:05,470
I hope I'm not too late.

1515
02:43:05,550 --> 02:43:07,010
No. Come right in.

1516
02:43:30,660 --> 02:43:31,660
Yeah?

1517
02:43:32,160 --> 02:43:33,490
Hello, Juana.

1518
02:43:33,790 --> 02:43:36,290
Yeah, he's here. Jordy, it's for you.

1519
02:43:41,670 --> 02:43:42,880
Yes, dear?

1520
02:43:47,180 --> 02:43:50,010
Stay right there, honey.
I'm coming right down.

1521
02:43:54,520 --> 02:43:57,350
Don't you folks wait on us, we'll catch up.

1522
02:43:58,730 --> 02:44:00,350
Son, you're way behind.

1523
02:44:03,440 --> 02:44:05,940
Howdy, everybody, look what we found.

1524
02:44:12,700 --> 02:44:14,040
There you are.

1525
02:44:15,240 --> 02:44:16,950
We were getting worried.

1526
02:44:17,750 --> 02:44:19,870
You'd better get dressed, Jett.

1527
02:44:22,130 --> 02:44:25,130
You wanted me to go over
the speech with you, too.

1528
02:44:25,840 --> 02:44:27,670
Come on, we'd better hurry.

1529
02:44:30,130 --> 02:44:33,640
I'm sorry, but it happens to be
Mr. Jett Rink's orders, himself.

1530
02:44:34,060 --> 02:44:35,560
I'm just working here.

1531
02:44:35,850 --> 02:44:38,350
Everybody's orders. Same all over town.

1532
02:44:38,640 --> 02:44:42,480
The young lady should have gone
to a place where they do her people.

1533
02:44:55,990 --> 02:44:58,330
If it isn't the queen herself!

1534
02:44:58,910 --> 02:45:00,750
- Are you having fun?
- We're making out.

1535
02:45:00,830 --> 02:45:02,790
- How are you doing?
- Good.

1536
02:45:03,380 --> 02:45:05,210
Where are Mom and Dad?

1537
02:45:05,500 --> 02:45:07,170
Don't trifle with your luck.

1538
02:45:08,920 --> 02:45:10,090
There you are.

1539
02:45:10,720 --> 02:45:12,890
You wanted to talk to me, Dad?

1540
02:45:13,470 --> 02:45:16,850
If you can spare me a moment,
I'd like to talk to you, young lady.

1541
02:45:16,930 --> 02:45:18,270
Dad, must we now?

1542
02:45:18,430 --> 02:45:21,600
Jordan, we must hurry to be in time
for the grand entrance.

1543
02:45:21,690 --> 02:45:24,360
Luz, darling, you look just beautiful!

1544
02:45:25,400 --> 02:45:28,570
Help me round everybody up.
I'm sorry I'm so late.

1545
02:45:28,940 --> 02:45:30,780
All right, people....

1546
02:46:10,610 --> 02:46:12,820
Did some of you boys change this around?

1547
02:46:14,110 --> 02:46:17,950
We haven't changed a single comma.
Changes tend to throw you.

1548
02:46:18,950 --> 02:46:23,290
"Columbus discovered only the shell
of this country. Agassiz came..."

1549
02:46:30,460 --> 02:46:31,840
Where's Rink?

1550
02:46:32,050 --> 02:46:33,720
He went that way.

1551
02:46:48,730 --> 02:46:51,400
Looks like I just come in for a root beer.

1552
02:46:51,860 --> 02:46:54,860
That, my friend, is a Texas range.

1553
02:47:12,380 --> 02:47:14,260
What're you doing sitting up there?

1554
02:47:14,340 --> 02:47:18,850
"You've heard of Paul Revere?"
The Texan said, " Paul Revere?

1555
02:47:19,550 --> 02:47:22,890
"Oh, yes. Ain't he the fellow
that had to ride for help?"

1556
02:47:29,480 --> 02:47:32,900
<i>In just a few moments, Mr. Rink himself...</i>

1557
02:47:33,400 --> 02:47:35,900
<i>will be here at the microphone.</i>

1558
02:47:35,990 --> 02:47:37,610
Come on, let's go.

1559
02:47:45,500 --> 02:47:47,830
Jordy is looking for Jett Rink.

1560
02:47:48,080 --> 02:47:49,250
What?

1561
02:47:57,590 --> 02:48:02,050
Where we had our hair done. Jordy wants
to fight Jett because it was his orders.

1562
02:48:02,140 --> 02:48:05,270
On account of Juana. The girl said
they didn't take wetbacks.

1563
02:48:51,190 --> 02:48:53,310
Stay here, honey, I'll be right back.

1564
02:49:05,330 --> 02:49:07,540
You invited me here to insult my wife.

1565
02:49:08,870 --> 02:49:10,500
You're gonna answer for it!

1566
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,340
Ain't you the one who married the squaw?

1567
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,380
What's the matter, boy?
Not having a good time?

1568
02:49:17,460 --> 02:49:20,550
Get them up, Rink! Everybody knows
you got this coming to you!

1569
02:49:20,630 --> 02:49:21,970
Jordy, no!

1570
02:49:40,320 --> 02:49:44,320
You want it in front of everybody,
or you want to come outside?

1571
02:49:45,490 --> 02:49:49,250
I don't care much whether it's here
or outside...

1572
02:49:49,870 --> 02:49:53,830
so long as I get one punch
at that stuck-up face of yours.

1573
02:49:57,880 --> 02:49:59,840
Sit down.

1574
02:50:03,680 --> 02:50:04,800
Governor.

1575
02:50:05,260 --> 02:50:06,970
How are you this evening?

1576
02:50:08,010 --> 02:50:12,350
<i>And now, to introduce our guest of honor,
we hear from a man...</i>

1577
02:50:12,640 --> 02:50:17,320
<i>known from the rocky coast of Maine
to the Golden Gate in California.</i>

1578
02:50:17,900 --> 02:50:20,820
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, our own...</i>

1579
02:50:21,240 --> 02:50:23,280
<i>Senator Oliver Whiteside.</i>

1580
02:50:50,430 --> 02:50:51,770
Get them up.

1581
02:50:53,430 --> 02:50:56,150
You had this coming to you
for a long time.

1582
02:51:01,940 --> 02:51:04,280
You'll get what you gave my boy.

1583
02:51:05,280 --> 02:51:06,280
Get them up.

1584
02:51:06,360 --> 02:51:07,450
Get them up!

1585
02:51:09,780 --> 02:51:11,790
<i>Proud, friendly...</i>

1586
02:51:12,290 --> 02:51:15,370
<i>warm-hearted, successful.</i>

1587
02:51:16,120 --> 02:51:19,460
<i>Yes, successful l am sure....</i>

1588
02:51:26,430 --> 02:51:28,590
You ain't even worth hitting.

1589
02:51:33,140 --> 02:51:35,270
You want to know something true?

1590
02:51:37,400 --> 02:51:38,810
You're all through.

1591
02:52:01,380 --> 02:52:04,510
<i>I'm going to ask you
to come with me tonight...</i>

1592
02:52:04,670 --> 02:52:09,010
<i>as l turn back the pages
in my book of happy memories...</i>

1593
02:52:09,470 --> 02:52:13,010
<i>and l recall the first time
l saw young Jett Rink.</i>

1594
02:52:13,100 --> 02:52:15,520
- Where's the boy?
- Juana took Jordy upstairs.

1595
02:52:15,640 --> 02:52:16,930
Let's get out of here.

1596
02:52:17,020 --> 02:52:18,350
I'll go get Luz.

1597
02:52:23,020 --> 02:52:24,860
Come on, Luz. We're leaving.

1598
02:52:25,610 --> 02:52:27,490
Excuse me, please.

1599
02:52:31,910 --> 02:52:34,040
<i>The years passed quickly...</i>

1600
02:52:34,540 --> 02:52:36,870
<i>as the years have a way of doing.</i>

1601
02:52:36,950 --> 02:52:38,540
<i>And now l see Jett Rink...</i>

1602
02:52:44,420 --> 02:52:48,800
<i>afraid of neither opposition
nor hard work...</i>

1603
02:52:49,220 --> 02:52:52,050
<i>his eyes set on the far distant...</i>

1604
02:52:52,140 --> 02:52:55,430
<i>goal toward which he's ever working...</i>

1605
02:52:55,890 --> 02:52:58,180
<i>planning, striving.</i>

1606
02:53:01,480 --> 02:53:04,150
<i>And now we come to Jett Rink, the man.</i>

1607
02:53:05,320 --> 02:53:07,820
<i>Texas has been kind to Jett Rink.</i>

1608
02:53:08,490 --> 02:53:12,120
<i>And Jett, never forgetting this kindness...</i>

1609
02:53:12,570 --> 02:53:15,240
<i>is ever ready to devote his resources...</i>

1610
02:53:15,700 --> 02:53:19,330
<i>to the greater glory of the state
which reared him...</i>

1611
02:53:19,410 --> 02:53:22,580
<i>which, in turn,
does honor to him tonight...</i>

1612
02:53:23,040 --> 02:53:26,500
<i>in this great gathering here present.</i>

1613
02:53:28,260 --> 02:53:30,630
<i>And now, my friends, here...</i>

1614
02:53:30,930 --> 02:53:35,560
<i>and to the thousands of you
listening across the nation...</i>

1615
02:53:35,680 --> 02:53:37,220
<i>l have the privilege, yes...</i>

1616
02:53:39,600 --> 02:53:45,190
<i>l have the great honor to introduce
a legend in his own time...</i>

1617
02:53:45,820 --> 02:53:47,440
<i>a great Texan...</i>

1618
02:53:47,900 --> 02:53:50,490
<i>an outstanding American!</i>

1619
02:53:50,900 --> 02:53:54,070
<i>Yes, my friends, a man!</i>

1620
02:53:54,620 --> 02:53:57,580
<i>I give to you Jett Rink!</i>

1621
02:54:31,820 --> 02:54:33,650
You can count on me.

1622
02:54:38,080 --> 02:54:39,870
All right, goodbye.

1623
02:54:41,660 --> 02:54:42,790
How bad?

1624
02:54:43,210 --> 02:54:45,210
It hit pretty hard in Vientecito.

1625
02:54:45,790 --> 02:54:50,050
Dr. Guerra set up an auxiliary hospital.
He needs help. I've got to go there.

1626
02:54:50,550 --> 02:54:53,930
You'll make better time
if you wait till first light and fly.

1627
02:54:54,180 --> 02:54:57,050
I hate to spend the
night under Jett's roof.

1628
02:54:57,390 --> 02:55:02,230
Me, too. If we weren't transporting
a circus, we'd all hightail it out of here.

1629
02:55:18,740 --> 02:55:21,450
I hope she doesn't let this
upset her too much.

1630
02:55:22,080 --> 02:55:24,080
This business tonight...

1631
02:55:25,500 --> 02:55:29,920
it's just one of those things.
The best thing to do is forget about it.

1632
02:55:30,880 --> 02:55:34,220
Go ahead and forget it.
Me, I'm going to remember it!

1633
02:55:35,760 --> 02:55:37,260
Now look, Jordy.

1634
02:55:38,220 --> 02:55:39,510
Take it easy.

1635
02:55:40,470 --> 02:55:44,060
We've had just about enough excitement
around here for one night.

1636
02:55:44,730 --> 02:55:46,100
Yeah, I guess so.

1637
02:55:50,400 --> 02:55:53,570
You've always had a mind of your own
and used it.

1638
02:55:54,530 --> 02:55:56,860
You've done things your own way.

1639
02:56:00,620 --> 02:56:04,450
You knew what you were doing
when you married in that direction.

1640
02:56:06,790 --> 02:56:10,790
I told you myself the morning
after you broke the news, remember?

1641
02:56:12,250 --> 02:56:16,260
I told you then that I knew
Juana was a mighty fine little gal...

1642
02:56:17,840 --> 02:56:21,430
but that marrying her was asking
for trouble. Remember?

1643
02:56:21,850 --> 02:56:23,310
I told you that.

1644
02:56:25,180 --> 02:56:28,980
Lots of folks in these parts
get pretty jumpy about that sort of thing.

1645
02:56:29,060 --> 02:56:30,270
Jett's only one of them.

1646
02:56:30,350 --> 02:56:34,480
I know those people. We've run
into this before. We're doing fine.

1647
02:56:36,860 --> 02:56:40,530
I'm concerned it has to do with the people
that ought to know better.

1648
02:56:44,620 --> 02:56:46,120
Like my own father.

1649
02:56:48,500 --> 02:56:52,340
Just the simple truth. That's you.
That's the way you think.

1650
02:56:53,250 --> 02:56:57,720
I don't care about Jett Rink,
but you, Papa, that's different.

1651
02:56:58,170 --> 02:57:00,010
Now you look here, Jordy!

1652
02:57:00,720 --> 02:57:02,720
You can't talk to me like that.

1653
02:57:04,010 --> 02:57:05,720
No man can!

1654
02:57:08,180 --> 02:57:11,850
I'm a fair man. I've been fair all my life,
with everybody!

1655
02:57:12,650 --> 02:57:16,690
And you, my own son,
can't tell me that I'm not a fair man!

1656
02:57:20,860 --> 02:57:22,070
Look, Jordy...

1657
02:57:23,240 --> 02:57:26,490
there's ways of living,
and there's ways of doing things...

1658
02:57:26,620 --> 02:57:29,870
that folks abide by when they want
to live right and happily...

1659
02:57:29,960 --> 02:57:32,000
in the comfort of their own people.

1660
02:57:32,420 --> 02:57:35,590
I always say that Juana is
a mighty fine gal, but...

1661
02:57:35,670 --> 02:57:38,710
Don't sit there and prove what I say!
I don't like to hear it!

1662
02:57:39,260 --> 02:57:41,260
You're not being fair!

1663
02:57:42,890 --> 02:57:45,720
When that ruckus started,
who went after Rink?

1664
02:57:46,220 --> 02:57:48,060
Your old man.

1665
02:57:48,350 --> 02:57:51,230
- Who took him to account? Your old man.
- And why?

1666
02:57:52,230 --> 02:57:53,400
Because of my wife?

1667
02:57:53,480 --> 02:57:54,560
- Yes!
- No!

1668
02:57:54,900 --> 02:57:57,610
Because your son, Jordan Benedict...

1669
02:57:57,730 --> 02:58:00,860
descendant of the long, proud line
of Reata...

1670
02:58:00,950 --> 02:58:05,070
got knocked flat on his back
in front of all of Texas. That's why!

1671
02:58:22,260 --> 02:58:25,090
Forget it. Don't worry yourself about it.

1672
02:58:34,270 --> 02:58:38,900
Mom, you made a mistake when you got
yourself mixed up with us rowdy Texans.

1673
02:58:40,400 --> 02:58:45,110
I'm shocked at you! I'm shocked
at all of us! I'm just so ashamed!

1674
02:58:45,660 --> 02:58:49,950
I'll never forget the sight of my brother
barging into the grand ballroom...

1675
02:58:50,040 --> 02:58:54,620
with all of our friends, disgracing us!
Then my father made it a bigger brawl!

1676
02:58:54,710 --> 02:58:57,130
How can I face people again?

1677
02:58:57,210 --> 02:58:59,630
If you keep seeing Jett,
you won't have to face me.

1678
02:58:59,710 --> 02:59:00,760
Children!

1679
02:59:01,170 --> 02:59:03,130
How about that anyway, Mom?

1680
02:59:03,220 --> 02:59:04,970
I haven't been asked.

1681
02:59:05,050 --> 02:59:08,550
It seems that my family
just can't tolerate his success.

1682
02:59:08,850 --> 02:59:10,180
My darling, Luz.

1683
02:59:10,350 --> 02:59:13,520
Tonight meant a lot to Jett.
Really. I know.

1684
02:59:15,140 --> 02:59:18,820
If I only knew how to apologize to him,
I'd go to him now.

1685
02:59:20,650 --> 02:59:23,150
But I can't face all those people.

1686
02:59:24,110 --> 02:59:26,280
The party is over. They've all gone home.

1687
02:59:27,870 --> 02:59:30,540
He passed out like a light
in front of the whole crowd.

1688
02:59:30,620 --> 02:59:31,790
Oh, no!

1689
02:59:32,200 --> 02:59:33,960
That's what we heard, Luz.

1690
02:59:35,750 --> 02:59:37,960
He must have been ill.

1691
02:59:38,840 --> 02:59:40,670
Weak with shame or something.

1692
02:59:41,090 --> 02:59:43,920
He was plain drunk, if you'll forgive me.

1693
02:59:45,010 --> 02:59:46,760
I don't believe you.

1694
02:59:48,510 --> 02:59:51,680
The party broke up early,
but not a minute too soon.

1695
02:59:58,350 --> 03:00:00,570
Give me Mr. Rink's penthouse, please.

1696
03:00:00,650 --> 03:00:04,320
You're not going up there,
even if I have to sit on you!

1697
03:00:05,610 --> 03:00:08,320
It's important. Do you know where he is?

1698
03:00:08,410 --> 03:00:11,370
Luz, it's not like you
to make a fool of yourself.

1699
03:00:12,870 --> 03:00:16,370
I know where he is, honey.
Come along with Uncle Bawley.

1700
03:00:18,620 --> 03:00:21,130
All right, Luz. If you must go.

1701
03:00:23,500 --> 03:00:24,670
I must.

1702
03:00:27,090 --> 03:00:30,260
I've always held a strange power
over your mother.

1703
03:00:37,940 --> 03:00:39,600
I'm sorry, Mother.

1704
03:00:50,870 --> 03:00:54,700
What do you say, doll face?
About ready to come along with me?

1705
03:00:57,580 --> 03:00:59,210
It's time we hit the hay.

1706
03:01:04,710 --> 03:01:05,880
I give up.

1707
03:01:10,970 --> 03:01:12,260
Can we go to work now?

1708
03:01:12,350 --> 03:01:15,850
Leave him alone.
He owns the place, let him enjoy it.

1709
03:01:15,930 --> 03:01:17,100
Shut up.

1710
03:01:18,140 --> 03:01:19,310
Shut up!

1711
03:01:38,160 --> 03:01:41,170
Ladies and gentlemen
and distinguished guests.

1712
03:01:45,290 --> 03:01:47,960
I just want to count the blessings...

1713
03:01:50,090 --> 03:01:53,760
that this great domain
has bestowed upon her humble son.

1714
03:01:56,310 --> 03:01:57,600
My friends...

1715
03:02:00,310 --> 03:02:02,230
this is a man.

1716
03:02:09,280 --> 03:02:10,950
Old Mother Texas!

1717
03:02:12,740 --> 03:02:14,740
What did she give to me?

1718
03:02:15,490 --> 03:02:17,990
Not a goddamn thing.

1719
03:02:18,490 --> 03:02:22,370
You've got to work and sweat
and steal it from her.

1720
03:02:25,130 --> 03:02:29,760
But I got mine right out of the ground.

1721
03:02:32,970 --> 03:02:34,470
Poor Jett...

1722
03:02:37,050 --> 03:02:39,180
fighting for what's good.

1723
03:02:39,890 --> 03:02:41,140
Flunky!

1724
03:02:42,640 --> 03:02:45,060
Flunky for Bick Benedict...

1725
03:02:46,520 --> 03:02:47,730
her husband.

1726
03:02:52,360 --> 03:02:53,740
Poor Jett!

1727
03:03:01,120 --> 03:03:02,960
Poor pretty Leslie!

1728
03:03:05,120 --> 03:03:06,290
Pretty Leslie....

1729
03:03:08,590 --> 03:03:12,920
Pretty Leslie.
Wonderful, beautiful girl bride!

1730
03:03:15,590 --> 03:03:16,930
Poor boy.

1731
03:03:17,930 --> 03:03:18,970
Rich....

1732
03:03:19,680 --> 03:03:21,270
Rich Mrs. Benedict.

1733
03:03:25,390 --> 03:03:27,060
She's beautiful.

1734
03:03:28,520 --> 03:03:29,730
Lovely.

1735
03:03:30,530 --> 03:03:32,110
The woman a man wants.

1736
03:03:33,320 --> 03:03:35,660
A woman a man has got to have, too!

1737
03:03:59,550 --> 03:04:01,510
Thank you, Uncle Bawley.

1738
03:04:04,230 --> 03:04:05,480
Governor...

1739
03:04:09,810 --> 03:04:11,860
you know what you can do?

1740
03:04:49,850 --> 03:04:51,860
As soon as it lands, I'll sell it.

1741
03:04:52,190 --> 03:04:52,860
Good.

1742
03:04:52,940 --> 03:04:54,150
This is for me, boy.

1743
03:04:54,230 --> 03:04:55,440
The simple life.

1744
03:04:55,530 --> 03:04:57,650
No more of this highflying nonsense.

1745
03:05:28,060 --> 03:05:31,350
Juana, how does a hamburger
and a piece of pie sound to you?

1746
03:05:31,440 --> 03:05:32,610
Sounds very good.

1747
03:05:33,730 --> 03:05:36,070
No more of this highfalutin stuff.

1748
03:05:36,190 --> 03:05:38,900
Let's stop at this drive-in
and have us some chicken.

1749
03:05:38,990 --> 03:05:40,820
Then we can eat it with our fingers.

1750
03:06:32,620 --> 03:06:36,460
Nice place you have here. I've been
intending to stop every time I drove by.

1751
03:06:36,540 --> 03:06:37,710
Thank you.

1752
03:06:37,800 --> 03:06:40,380
What do you recommend?
How is the fried chicken?

1753
03:06:40,470 --> 03:06:43,010
Little Jordy wants ice cream, Grandpa.

1754
03:06:44,590 --> 03:06:45,640
Grandpa?

1755
03:06:47,560 --> 03:06:49,390
Ice cream it shall be.

1756
03:06:50,640 --> 03:06:52,810
Give the little fellow some ice cream.

1757
03:06:52,980 --> 03:06:54,650
Ice cream?

1758
03:06:54,730 --> 03:06:57,150
I thought that kid would want a tamale.

1759
03:07:08,240 --> 03:07:10,240
Give them what they want.

1760
03:07:27,010 --> 03:07:29,220
What do you say? Is this all right?

1761
03:07:30,180 --> 03:07:31,520
It's good.

1762
03:07:32,850 --> 03:07:35,520
After all that fancy food and high living.

1763
03:07:35,850 --> 03:07:37,190
This is the life.

1764
03:07:54,330 --> 03:07:55,500
Hey, you.

1765
03:07:58,840 --> 03:08:02,550
The plane should arrive in Benedict
around 1:30.

1766
03:08:06,550 --> 03:08:08,550
You're in the wrong place.

1767
03:08:08,760 --> 03:08:11,100
Come on, let's get out of here.

1768
03:08:12,680 --> 03:08:14,480
Your money is no good here.

1769
03:08:15,940 --> 03:08:17,600
Come on, let's go.

1770
03:08:19,480 --> 03:08:20,570
You, too.

1771
03:08:20,690 --> 03:08:22,070
Hold on a minute.

1772
03:08:29,660 --> 03:08:31,490
Yes, what do you want?

1773
03:08:33,410 --> 03:08:38,420
Look here, Sarge. I'd sure appreciate it
if you were more polite to these people.

1774
03:08:39,580 --> 03:08:41,090
You would, eh?

1775
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:45,170
I'm Bick Benedict.
Your neighbor, you might say.

1776
03:08:45,840 --> 03:08:48,550
Does that give you special privileges?

1777
03:08:48,930 --> 03:08:53,390
The name Benedict's meant something
to people around here for a long time.

1778
03:08:55,850 --> 03:08:58,100
That there papoose down there...

1779
03:08:59,230 --> 03:09:00,940
is his name Benedict, too?

1780
03:09:08,740 --> 03:09:11,990
Yes. Come to think of it, it is.

1781
03:09:14,370 --> 03:09:16,120
Forget I asked you.

1782
03:09:16,580 --> 03:09:19,710
Go sit down,
and we ain't gonna have no trouble.

1783
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:22,670
But this bunch's gonna eat
somewhere else.

1784
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:25,630
All right, come on. Let's go.

1785
03:09:25,710 --> 03:09:27,170
Come on, you, too.

1786
03:09:31,300 --> 03:09:33,470
You're out of line, mister.

1787
03:11:57,200 --> 03:12:00,200
Is that the best
that old horse thief can do?

1788
03:12:00,990 --> 03:12:04,330
He's feeling your mood, darling.

1789
03:12:05,670 --> 03:12:08,750
<i>There's a lot of Clair de Lune
in both of you old fire-eaters.</i>

1790
03:12:09,750 --> 03:12:12,090
You're both rather gentle creatures.

1791
03:12:12,510 --> 03:12:13,840
How awful!

1792
03:12:17,840 --> 03:12:19,350
Those kids....

1793
03:12:20,010 --> 03:12:21,510
Look at them.

1794
03:12:22,010 --> 03:12:25,480
Those kids, in their infinite wisdom,
are smarter than we are.

1795
03:12:26,520 --> 03:12:29,360
They know I'm a disgrace.
And they don't hesitate to say so.

1796
03:12:31,730 --> 03:12:34,070
Even the calf's got my number.

1797
03:12:36,360 --> 03:12:39,030
I don't have to take it from a sheep!

1798
03:12:40,450 --> 03:12:41,950
Now, Jordan!

1799
03:12:48,830 --> 03:12:52,800
Hello, Vashti. We're all fine.
How'd you make it back?

1800
03:12:55,840 --> 03:12:58,680
- They all made it back in one piece.
- Jolly.

1801
03:12:59,390 --> 03:13:02,890
Yes, all our guests have finally gone.
Thank goodness!

1802
03:13:05,680 --> 03:13:08,350
But more have left than we bargained for.

1803
03:13:08,560 --> 03:13:12,570
Luz has gone on to Hollywood with Lola,
whatever the name was.

1804
03:13:14,940 --> 03:13:18,280
She decided she would like to see
how she liked Hollywood.

1805
03:13:20,410 --> 03:13:22,200
We never had one in the family.

1806
03:13:22,280 --> 03:13:24,080
Good Lord, an actress!

1807
03:13:26,580 --> 03:13:30,920
All you can do is raise them.
You can't live their lives for them.

1808
03:13:33,920 --> 03:13:36,510
Judy and Bob are out looking at a ranch.

1809
03:13:37,260 --> 03:13:38,420
A small one.

1810
03:13:40,640 --> 03:13:43,640
Jordy and Juana are gonna move
into Vientecito.

1811
03:13:43,930 --> 03:13:46,930
And we, we're home minding the babies.

1812
03:13:51,980 --> 03:13:56,320
The sun's going down over the yardarm.
When are you going to open up the bar?

1813
03:13:56,400 --> 03:13:57,940
Anytime. Go ahead.

1814
03:13:59,280 --> 03:14:02,200
Remember, one of these days
that bourbon's gonna kill you.

1815
03:14:02,280 --> 03:14:04,450
Okay. It'll be me or it.

1816
03:14:05,120 --> 03:14:06,870
One of us has got to go.

1817
03:14:09,290 --> 03:14:12,960
I'm going to stay right here.
It's coming onto spring.

1818
03:14:14,130 --> 03:14:17,130
Roundup time is no time
to be away from Reata.

1819
03:14:26,970 --> 03:14:30,980
Honey, everybody's on the move.
The strays are leaving the herd.

1820
03:14:33,480 --> 03:14:38,780
I wouldn't mind it too much if you wanted
to pack up and go back home for a spell.

1821
03:14:40,320 --> 03:14:41,360
Home?

1822
03:14:42,660 --> 03:14:46,990
Where do you think I've been
this last breathless quarter of a century?

1823
03:14:48,370 --> 03:14:49,500
Home.

1824
03:14:50,120 --> 03:14:52,290
Look, boy, I belong here!

1825
03:14:55,250 --> 03:14:58,250
You really want to know
what's gotten my goat?

1826
03:15:00,510 --> 03:15:03,340
My own grandson doesn't even look
like one of us.

1827
03:15:03,680 --> 03:15:06,350
He really looks like a little wetback.

1828
03:15:12,350 --> 03:15:14,850
<i>Little muchacho fires up, don't he?</i>

1829
03:15:16,520 --> 03:15:18,480
I'm sorry, Jordan Benedict IV.

1830
03:15:19,360 --> 03:15:21,690
There's times when a man
just has to be honest.

1831
03:15:25,110 --> 03:15:26,910
You know something, Leslie?

1832
03:15:28,080 --> 03:15:29,870
There's no use kidding.

1833
03:15:31,040 --> 03:15:32,540
I'm a failure.

1834
03:15:33,250 --> 03:15:36,500
Nothing has turned out like I had planned.

1835
03:15:40,130 --> 03:15:43,470
I just feel like my saddle's turning
right out from under me.

1836
03:15:46,430 --> 03:15:48,260
Do you want to know something?

1837
03:15:50,720 --> 03:15:52,560
I think you're great!

1838
03:15:55,310 --> 03:15:58,820
Don't ask me why.
Some things are difficult to explain.

1839
03:16:00,270 --> 03:16:04,610
You know all that fine riding you used
to do, and all that fancy roping...

1840
03:16:04,700 --> 03:16:07,740
and all that glamor stuff
you did to dazzle me?

1841
03:16:07,870 --> 03:16:09,410
It was impressive.

1842
03:16:10,950 --> 03:16:14,460
But none of it ever made you
quite as big a man to me...

1843
03:16:15,040 --> 03:16:18,380
as you were on the floor
of Sarge's hamburger joint.

1844
03:16:22,710 --> 03:16:24,800
When you tumbled rearward...

1845
03:16:24,970 --> 03:16:28,470
and landed crashing
into that pile of dirty dishes...

1846
03:16:29,890 --> 03:16:32,220
you were at last my hero.

1847
03:16:33,640 --> 03:16:36,190
That's what you always wanted to be.

1848
03:16:36,810 --> 03:16:37,850
Could be.

1849
03:16:38,560 --> 03:16:42,230
When we went into that place,
before the fight started....

1850
03:16:44,320 --> 03:16:46,990
What a fight! It was glorious!

1851
03:16:48,530 --> 03:16:52,120
Before we went in,
I was feeling like you are now.

1852
03:16:53,120 --> 03:16:54,950
I was thinking to myself:

1853
03:16:55,540 --> 03:16:56,660
"Well...

1854
03:16:56,750 --> 03:17:00,540
"Jordan and I, and the others behind us,
have been failures."

1855
03:17:02,040 --> 03:17:03,630
And then it happened.

1856
03:17:04,670 --> 03:17:09,140
You wound up on the floor, on your back,
in the middle of the salad.

1857
03:17:10,640 --> 03:17:12,100
And I said to myself:

1858
03:17:13,180 --> 03:17:14,220
"Well...

1859
03:17:15,020 --> 03:17:17,190
"after 100 years...

1860
03:17:18,190 --> 03:17:20,020
"the Benedict family...

1861
03:17:20,310 --> 03:17:23,020
"is a real big success."

1862
03:17:25,650 --> 03:17:27,820
You want to know something, Leslie?

1863
03:17:29,360 --> 03:17:31,370
If I live to be 90...

1864
03:17:33,240 --> 03:17:36,080
I'll never be able to figure you out.

1865
03:17:36,104 --> 03:17:38,704
