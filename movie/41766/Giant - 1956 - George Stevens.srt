1
00:04:01,466 --> 00:04:02,414
There he is.

2
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,979
There's the stallion. That's War Winds.

3
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:09,330
Beautiful.

4
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:11,887
That's my daughter riding him. Leslie.

5
00:04:17,403 --> 00:04:19,956
Leslie is my daughter. She's riding him.

6
00:04:22,203 --> 00:04:24,592
Doctor, that sure is a beautiful animal.

7
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:28,305
We'll get to the horses
first thing in the morning.

8
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:31,412
Now you'll come up to the house
and get ready for dinner.

9
00:04:51,162 --> 00:04:53,399
You're from Nevada, Mr. Beckwith?

10
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,732
Texas, Mama.

11
00:04:55,804 --> 00:04:57,657
You're from Texas, Mr. Beckwith?

12
00:04:57,723 --> 00:05:00,473
Yes, ma'am, Texas. Benedict's the name.

13
00:05:02,522 --> 00:05:04,792
You're here about the horses, aren't you?

14
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:05,807
Yes, ma'am.

15
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:10,931
I came to buy your stallion, War Winds,
if your daughter doesn't mind too much.

16
00:05:12,636 --> 00:05:15,984
In all likelihood,
Leslie will be leaving us soon anyway.

17
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:22,581
David is with the embassy in Washington.
He's been called back to England.

18
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:25,328
Will she like it there, do you think?

19
00:05:27,321 --> 00:05:29,080
She's going to marry him?

20
00:05:30,138 --> 00:05:33,968
Mother! Let me sell Mr. Benedict
War Winds.

21
00:05:34,587 --> 00:05:36,791
I can tell you all his bad points.

22
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:39,890
For one, he eats too much,
doesn't he, Papa?

23
00:05:40,538 --> 00:05:44,116
You see, it's either War Winds or me.
Something has to go.

24
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:47,860
You know that horse is just too spirited
for any woman to ride.

25
00:05:48,378 --> 00:05:53,267
I know your horse is going to miss you
and all this nice, green country, but...

26
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:56,049
I'll try to make him happy in Texas.

27
00:05:56,252 --> 00:05:58,324
Isn't Texas green, Mr. Benedict?

28
00:05:58,715 --> 00:06:00,952
No, ma'am, not altogether.

29
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:04,022
You must tell us about Texas,
Mr. Benedict.

30
00:06:04,283 --> 00:06:05,940
It's not that easy.

31
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:11,381
It's different than any other state, I think.

32
00:06:13,178 --> 00:06:16,692
At least that's what we think.
It's almost a different country.

33
00:06:17,882 --> 00:06:21,877
From an Englishman's point of view,
its mere size takes your breath away.

34
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:23,894
Yes, it's big all right.

35
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:26,007
How large are your ranches?

36
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,168
Most every size. Large and small.

37
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,047
Mr. Benedict's Reata is
one of the largest of them all.

38
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:34,553
Oh, really?

39
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:37,724
And just how large is that?

40
00:06:37,946 --> 00:06:39,858
It's one of the biggest.

41
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:43,769
How big is that?

42
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:49,363
There are one or two others as big,
I suppose, up where we come from...

43
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:52,981
and some larger ones
on the coastal plains.

44
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:56,536
Can't you be more specific?

45
00:06:56,698 --> 00:07:00,529
What's the size of your place?
50,000? 20,000 acres?

46
00:07:06,268 --> 00:07:10,327
Around a half million.
595,000 acres, to be exact.

47
00:07:11,868 --> 00:07:14,039
I'd call that quite a parcel!

48
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,593
How many acres did you say,
Mr. Benedict?

49
00:07:17,148 --> 00:07:20,213
He said 595,000 acres, Mama.

50
00:07:20,411 --> 00:07:22,801
And you should see the greedy look
on your face.

51
00:07:23,453 --> 00:07:24,793
Witness excused.

52
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:29,425
Won't you join us at the Hunt Ball?
I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

53
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,736
No, thank you, Miss Leslie.

54
00:07:31,804 --> 00:07:34,290
I'm afraid I wouldn't look good
in this outfit.

55
00:07:52,252 --> 00:07:53,528
I like your country.

56
00:07:56,251 --> 00:07:59,284
Why don't you stay a while
and really see something of it?

57
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:03,377
It's roundup time in my country.
Big spring roundup.

58
00:08:05,307 --> 00:08:06,453
Your country?

59
00:08:07,037 --> 00:08:08,148
Reata.

60
00:08:09,724 --> 00:08:14,035
Your country, my country.
You make us sound so far apart.

61
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:25,750
Maybe you could come out and see it...

62
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:28,241
if you get a chance.

63
00:08:51,804 --> 00:08:54,454
I'll be off real early in the morning, so...

64
00:08:55,804 --> 00:08:56,754
goodbye.

65
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:58,520
I'm awfully glad you came.

66
00:08:59,548 --> 00:09:02,297
I'm not going to say goodbye to you
in the moonlight.

67
00:09:02,685 --> 00:09:05,238
It would just be too touching. Good night!

68
00:10:20,572 --> 00:10:21,521
"Texas".

69
00:10:24,894 --> 00:10:26,387
Are you in love with him?

70
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:28,154
Yes, I think so.

71
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,213
Will you do me a favor
and run along to bed?

72
00:10:41,469 --> 00:10:43,063
- Leslie?
- Good night.

73
00:10:51,357 --> 00:10:53,561
If you won't marry David Karfrey...

74
00:10:54,878 --> 00:10:56,371
will you give him to me?

75
00:10:56,444 --> 00:10:58,169
Yes! Now, good night.

76
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:27,866
As far as I'm concerned, it's a deal.

77
00:11:32,253 --> 00:11:35,570
- $10,000 is a lot of money.
- It's a lot of horse.

78
00:11:36,285 --> 00:11:38,490
Let's have some breakfast and get going.

79
00:11:53,181 --> 00:11:54,904
- Why, Leslie!
- Good morning.

80
00:12:06,302 --> 00:12:09,816
You don't look as if you'd been dancing
all night, Miss Leslie.

81
00:12:10,461 --> 00:12:12,348
I came home at 10:45.

82
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:16,279
I read about Texas until 5:00 this morning.

83
00:12:16,413 --> 00:12:18,965
Let the poor boy
eat his breakfast in peace.

84
00:12:21,468 --> 00:12:23,706
It takes a heap of reading, Texas does.

85
00:12:26,463 --> 00:12:28,470
We really stole Texas, didn't we?

86
00:12:29,405 --> 00:12:31,063
I mean, away from Mexico.

87
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:36,310
You're catching me a bit early
to start joking.

88
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:40,250
But I'm not joking.
It's all right there in the history books.

89
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:44,279
Mr. Austin came down
with 300 families, it says.

90
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,580
The next thing you know,
they're claiming it from Mexico.

91
00:12:51,262 --> 00:12:54,612
I never heard anything as ignorant
as some Eastern people...

92
00:12:54,685 --> 00:12:55,729
Oh, please, Jordan.

93
00:12:56,223 --> 00:12:58,676
I'm only speaking impersonally.
About history.

94
00:12:59,165 --> 00:13:01,654
You all think
that the glory happened in the East...

95
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:03,931
with Valley Forge and Bunker Hill!

96
00:13:05,245 --> 00:13:09,239
Do you know about San Jacinto?
Have you heard about the Alamo?

97
00:13:09,628 --> 00:13:10,906
Why, certainly.

98
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,295
I read about them all last night.

99
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:19,994
I didn't mean to be impolite,
but it's so new to me.

100
00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:23,224
I just mean, it's just all so new...

101
00:13:23,998 --> 00:13:25,525
and so fascinating!

102
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:30,358
You mustn't talk that way to a Texan.
They feel very strongly about their state.

103
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,630
He shouldn't take it so hard.

104
00:13:34,238 --> 00:13:38,068
Jordan, you would think
somebody had spoiled you terribly.

105
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:40,123
Your wife or somebody.

106
00:13:41,726 --> 00:13:44,444
I haven't any wife. I live with my sister.

107
00:13:52,638 --> 00:13:54,066
Why aren't you married?

108
00:13:55,998 --> 00:14:00,372
First you attack a man's country,
and now you try to pry into his family life.

109
00:14:01,086 --> 00:14:02,135
Thank you, Doctor.

110
00:14:05,183 --> 00:14:06,644
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

111
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,236
- Good morning, Lacey.
- Good morning, Papa.

112
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:12,762
How are we doing?

113
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:16,572
We'll have to be getting along soon
if you're going to make your train.

114
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,935
- Good morning, everybody.
- Good morning, Nancy.

115
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,598
Good morning, dear.

116
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,361
Good morning, Mr. Benedict.

117
00:14:26,494 --> 00:14:28,764
Isn't this a beautiful morning?

118
00:14:39,038 --> 00:14:42,869
Leslie, if Mr. Benedict has finished
his breakfast...

119
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,139
why don't you show him the stables?

120
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,908
We've just quarreled politely about Texas.
It's no use trying to pawn me off on him.

121
00:14:53,086 --> 00:14:54,363
And anyway, Mother...

122
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:58,421
he's probably engaged to marry
the daughter of the adjoining ranch...

123
00:14:58,943 --> 00:15:01,660
who, though beautiful,
is comparatively poor.

124
00:15:01,982 --> 00:15:05,180
She only has 200,000 acres
and half a million cows.

125
00:15:07,646 --> 00:15:09,468
Is she pretty?

126
00:15:13,632 --> 00:15:14,809
We must hurry.

127
00:15:17,214 --> 00:15:19,769
Mr. Benedict and I will have
to be leaving now.

128
00:15:35,743 --> 00:15:39,572
Who, may I ask, is the lucky young lady
that you're going to marry...

129
00:15:39,966 --> 00:15:41,724
with all those cows?

130
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:45,434
I'll get the car.

131
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:52,244
It's funny, ma'am.
My neighbor is a girl, Vashti Hake.

132
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:04,861
There was some talk of my marrying her,
but I'm not.

133
00:16:05,311 --> 00:16:07,383
Come on, if you want to catch that train.

134
00:16:10,623 --> 00:16:12,565
It all sounds so romantic!

135
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:53,820
Come along, David, you're for me.

136
00:17:44,127 --> 00:17:45,719
What's that, a wolf?

137
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,354
No, honey.

138
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:50,137
It's just a little old coyote.

139
00:17:57,408 --> 00:18:00,124
Don't you think you've done
enough sightseeing?

140
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,915
Tell me when we're in Texas.

141
00:18:02,016 --> 00:18:04,568
That's Texas you've been looking at.

142
00:18:07,648 --> 00:18:09,239
For the last eight hours.

143
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:16,159
I don't know how other brides feel
on their honeymoon...

144
00:18:17,216 --> 00:18:19,387
but I'm having a lovely time.

145
00:18:19,936 --> 00:18:22,008
We can't say it's been dull.

146
00:18:22,942 --> 00:18:25,213
That is, so far anyway.

147
00:18:45,728 --> 00:18:47,996
Wake up, honey. We're here, honey.

148
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:52,502
Where?

149
00:18:57,793 --> 00:18:58,775
Hello.

150
00:18:59,327 --> 00:19:00,308
Good morning.

151
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:07,223
Is that Texas?

152
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,711
It's Benedict. That's where we ship from.

153
00:19:47,008 --> 00:19:48,796
These people never learn!

154
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:52,826
I'm Mrs. Benedict.

155
00:20:01,248 --> 00:20:03,322
That means, "Welcome, the newlyweds".

156
00:20:08,127 --> 00:20:09,405
Let's go, Leslie.

157
00:20:09,985 --> 00:20:11,740
And what is your name?

158
00:20:14,945 --> 00:20:16,833
That's a beautiful name.

159
00:20:19,489 --> 00:20:21,245
Come on, it's 50 miles to coffee.

160
00:21:15,617 --> 00:21:18,170
This is it, honey. This is your home.

161
00:21:19,617 --> 00:21:21,179
But it's huge!

162
00:21:22,178 --> 00:21:24,283
I thought it was a ranch house.

163
00:21:24,353 --> 00:21:28,859
My old man built it to show the cotton
crowd we were just as high-powered.

164
00:21:29,632 --> 00:21:31,836
It's enormous just for the two of us.

165
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:33,464
Luz lives here with me.

166
00:21:34,018 --> 00:21:34,964
With us.

167
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:39,552
She's run the house since Ma passed on.
Some say she even runs the ranch!

168
00:21:48,865 --> 00:21:50,175
Take it easy, Leslie.

169
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,678
What are your names?

170
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,039
What do you mean behave?

171
00:22:10,401 --> 00:22:14,491
Here we don't make a fuss
over those people. You're a Texan now.

172
00:22:18,528 --> 00:22:21,758
Is that a state of mind? I'm still myself.

173
00:22:22,689 --> 00:22:25,470
You're my wife, honey. You're a Benedict.

174
00:22:26,209 --> 00:22:30,465
I still have a mind of my own.
Elsewhere, being gracious is acceptable.

175
00:22:32,353 --> 00:22:33,783
We're gracious, but...

176
00:22:41,058 --> 00:22:42,302
Fine thing...

177
00:22:42,786 --> 00:22:46,365
standing here quarreling
with rice still in our hair!

178
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:17,630
It's so nice and cool!

179
00:23:25,731 --> 00:23:27,933
I thought somebody was hurt, maybe.

180
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,000
We didn't know you were there.

181
00:23:32,802 --> 00:23:35,617
Well, home. We're here.

182
00:23:36,131 --> 00:23:38,040
I've been looking for you for weeks.

183
00:23:38,499 --> 00:23:40,985
We weren't expected to be back sooner,
were we?

184
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:44,346
With all the spring work to be done,
the roundup...

185
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:47,261
I didn't figure Bick would stay away.

186
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:53,758
If I miss a roundup every time I have
a honeymoon, I won't miss much, will I?

187
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,625
I thought I fired him off this place.

188
00:24:10,211 --> 00:24:12,926
Where do you think you're going
with my automobile?

189
00:24:13,571 --> 00:24:14,879
Just hold on.

190
00:24:15,491 --> 00:24:19,067
Don't go taking off on me.
That old truck broke down again.

191
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,720
You want me going down the road?

192
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:29,176
That's exactly what I was going to do.

193
00:24:30,465 --> 00:24:33,183
But she said,
"You stay on and do your work".

194
00:24:33,601 --> 00:24:35,293
Next time I tell you to get, you get!

195
00:24:35,363 --> 00:24:38,397
Bick and Jett are everlasting jangling
about something.

196
00:24:39,491 --> 00:24:42,588
- "Madama" is the one who told me to stay.
- That's right.

197
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:45,305
With you away,
we needed all the help there was.

198
00:24:45,794 --> 00:24:49,656
They're all scared to death of her.
You know that.

199
00:24:50,498 --> 00:24:52,408
Everyone, except you and me.

200
00:24:52,483 --> 00:24:53,891
You just tend to your work.

201
00:24:53,955 --> 00:24:55,864
Tell me who is the boss around here...

202
00:24:56,803 --> 00:25:01,177
and I'll be glad to do anything you want.
Just tell me who's the boss.

203
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,474
This is Bick's new wife.

204
00:25:06,499 --> 00:25:08,702
Leslie, this boy here is Jett Rink.

205
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,999
- Hello.
- He works for us.

206
00:25:21,251 --> 00:25:24,217
You'd better get going, Jett,
and get that truck fixed.

207
00:25:33,027 --> 00:25:35,198
Nobody is king in this country.

208
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:38,459
Nobody, no matter what they think.

209
00:25:40,387 --> 00:25:44,543
I'm sorry, honey. Things go "loco" here
every time I'm away.

210
00:25:49,154 --> 00:25:51,521
Remember the time of the big rodeo?

211
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:55,517
Old Kale Beebe blew in,
higher than a kite...

212
00:25:56,004 --> 00:25:58,369
slept on the sofa in your office.

213
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:03,160
He must have had nightmares.
He cut the couch to ribbons with his spurs.

214
00:26:04,228 --> 00:26:06,136
This here is Bick's room.

215
00:26:07,011 --> 00:26:09,399
This down here is your room, honey.

216
00:26:12,643 --> 00:26:13,592
Look...

217
00:26:16,003 --> 00:26:17,180
We're married.

218
00:26:18,851 --> 00:26:20,377
You know how that is.

219
00:26:23,044 --> 00:26:24,952
We'll take the connecting rooms.

220
00:26:25,443 --> 00:26:29,274
We'll make that into a sitting room
where we can sit and talk...

221
00:26:30,147 --> 00:26:32,057
and the breeze can get at us.

222
00:27:22,212 --> 00:27:23,803
Breakfast's ready.

223
00:27:24,866 --> 00:27:27,136
You and Jordan
have had breakfast already?

224
00:27:27,202 --> 00:27:31,031
We have our coffee and talk
every morning of our lives at 5:00.

225
00:27:31,363 --> 00:27:33,403
Try and get things rounded up for the day.

226
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,717
I thought I was going riding with him
to the roundup.

227
00:27:38,787 --> 00:27:41,503
It would've been too hot for you.
I told him so.

228
00:27:44,004 --> 00:27:45,498
Bring it in here.

229
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:50,114
You gotta watch out for that sun.
It's rough.

230
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:51,450
Sit down.

231
00:27:54,244 --> 00:27:57,593
Your blood's too thin. That's the trouble
with a lot of Easterners.

232
00:28:01,283 --> 00:28:02,297
Thank you.

233
00:28:04,995 --> 00:28:06,403
I'm fine, Luz.

234
00:28:07,651 --> 00:28:09,855
I'm a lot tougher perhaps
than you think I am.

235
00:28:13,732 --> 00:28:14,679
Me...

236
00:28:15,523 --> 00:28:19,833
I never had a sick day in my life.
Except when I got thrown and tromped on.

237
00:28:21,636 --> 00:28:24,002
All you gotta do is take it easy.

238
00:28:24,067 --> 00:28:26,369
This rich Texas air will fix you up.

239
00:28:29,732 --> 00:28:31,937
Don't you worry none
about being lonesome.

240
00:28:32,738 --> 00:28:34,594
I'll round up the neighbors.

241
00:28:34,692 --> 00:28:36,602
You're going to meet some folks.

242
00:28:36,677 --> 00:28:39,457
Yes, indeed.
You're going to meet some folks.

243
00:28:42,148 --> 00:28:43,970
This is Mr. And Mrs. Bale Clinch.

244
00:28:44,675 --> 00:28:47,261
Bick, it's about time. Howdy, ma'am.

245
00:28:47,428 --> 00:28:49,762
I'd like you to meet
my little wife, Adarene.

246
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,255
I'm mighty pleased to meet you.

247
00:28:53,764 --> 00:28:55,586
This is Judge Whiteside.

248
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:58,718
How do you do, Mrs. Benedict?
We sure are proud to have you here.

249
00:28:58,789 --> 00:29:01,724
Bick, congratulations.
Mighty happy for you, boy.

250
00:29:02,086 --> 00:29:03,198
She sure is pretty.

251
00:29:03,267 --> 00:29:04,576
I think so.

252
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:06,618
Here's Ula Japes.

253
00:29:06,691 --> 00:29:08,351
Glad to meet you, ma'am.

254
00:29:08,422 --> 00:29:09,947
Good to see you, Bick.

255
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,808
This is Ms. Wharton.

256
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,949
Howdy, Leslie. Mighty happy to meet you.

257
00:29:14,979 --> 00:29:16,125
Fernie Kling.

258
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,593
We're glad to have you with us.

259
00:29:18,948 --> 00:29:21,152
You've really done well for yourself.

260
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:22,398
Thank you, Fernie.

261
00:29:29,283 --> 00:29:31,586
Now you'll meet the neighbor
I told you about.

262
00:29:31,651 --> 00:29:35,164
The one who lives 50 miles away
with all those cows?

263
00:29:36,229 --> 00:29:39,262
Vashti, I'd like you to meet my wife.

264
00:29:40,453 --> 00:29:42,873
Hello, Vashti. So nice to meet you.

265
00:29:43,236 --> 00:29:44,991
Jordan told me so much about you.

266
00:29:48,196 --> 00:29:50,105
Mighty glad to know you.

267
00:29:50,693 --> 00:29:52,383
I'm awfully glad we're neighbors.

268
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,166
I hope we'll be real close friends.

269
00:30:05,446 --> 00:30:08,062
My name is Mort Snythe.
They call me Pinky.

270
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:12,768
Come here.

271
00:30:15,204 --> 00:30:17,440
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- We'll be seeing you.

272
00:30:56,996 --> 00:30:59,516
- This will perk you up, Miss Leslie.
- Thank you.

273
00:31:00,741 --> 00:31:03,611
I propose a toast to a daughter
of old Maryland...

274
00:31:03,781 --> 00:31:08,091
now blooming into a citizen
of the Lone Star State. To the bride!

275
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,341
Are you all right?

276
00:31:17,477 --> 00:31:18,940
I'm fine, don't worry.

277
00:31:19,366 --> 00:31:23,010
- There's more than one bride here today.
- How's that, Vashti?

278
00:31:24,165 --> 00:31:27,328
Mort Snythe and I were married yesterday
in Hermosa.

279
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:40,640
I'm gonna kiss him!

280
00:31:43,557 --> 00:31:45,281
I guess that leaves only me.

281
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:50,271
Why, Luz, everybody in the county knows
you'd rather herd cattle than make love!

282
00:31:50,374 --> 00:31:52,761
One thing you gotta say for cattle:

283
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:56,219
You put your brand on one of them,
you know where it's at!

284
00:32:00,868 --> 00:32:02,757
Come and get it!

285
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:27,105
The best food you ever ate, honey.

286
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:29,438
This is real Mexican "barbacoa".

287
00:32:29,668 --> 00:32:32,035
That's where we get the word "barbecue".

288
00:32:38,118 --> 00:32:39,394
What is that?

289
00:32:40,614 --> 00:32:41,792
Calf's head.

290
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:46,691
We take it and wrap it in clean white cloth
and then wrap it tight in canvas...

291
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:50,491
and put it down in a pit
of hot mesquite coals for 18 hours.

292
00:32:50,628 --> 00:32:52,866
And do those brains taste sweet!

293
00:32:53,285 --> 00:32:54,659
How fascinating!

294
00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:00,222
I don't think I'm really terribly hungry.
It must be the heat.

295
00:33:00,836 --> 00:33:02,048
You call this hot?

296
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:03,488
Wait till July!

297
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:08,482
Eat it while it's hot!

298
00:33:11,749 --> 00:33:13,788
What's the matter with her, Bick?

299
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,250
That's what I was afraid of!

300
00:33:32,517 --> 00:33:33,596
Leslie?

301
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:46,595
Good morning, Luz.

302
00:33:48,838 --> 00:33:50,267
What are you doing up?

303
00:33:51,173 --> 00:33:52,767
Getting breakfast.

304
00:33:58,055 --> 00:34:01,218
I think there's something
we should get in the clear.

305
00:34:02,245 --> 00:34:05,594
I don't want to take your place.
I want you to know that.

306
00:34:06,054 --> 00:34:08,924
But I can't have you
taking my place either.

307
00:34:09,478 --> 00:34:12,512
I can't be just a guest
in my husband's house.

308
00:34:12,581 --> 00:34:13,956
There you are.

309
00:34:14,022 --> 00:34:15,332
Good morning, darling.

310
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:17,089
- How are you feeling?
- Fine.

311
00:34:22,534 --> 00:34:23,876
You look fine.

312
00:34:24,711 --> 00:34:28,538
I want everybody to know, no matter
what happens around here in the future...

313
00:34:28,645 --> 00:34:31,034
I am never going to faint again.

314
00:34:39,174 --> 00:34:41,727
I'll never get the hang of you,
Mrs. Benedict.

315
00:34:55,815 --> 00:35:00,037
A horse that cost you a lot
for breeding stock, I'd use it for breeding.

316
00:35:00,103 --> 00:35:03,169
I wouldn't let anyone ride him.
I wouldn't care if she's your wife.

317
00:35:04,807 --> 00:35:07,970
I'd see she rides a more gentle animal
if I were you.

318
00:35:12,326 --> 00:35:14,564
She's going to fall off and break her neck.

319
00:35:27,782 --> 00:35:30,748
That's Old Polo. He's head "vaquero".

320
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:34,564
He's been here longer than any of us.

321
00:35:35,015 --> 00:35:37,218
Since Grandpa Benedict's time.

322
00:35:48,294 --> 00:35:49,789
Look at them, honey!

323
00:35:50,822 --> 00:35:54,564
There's never been anything like them
in this world, I can tell you.

324
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,828
Did you ever see such stock?

325
00:35:57,926 --> 00:35:59,236
Are they all ours?

326
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:03,359
These and 49,000 others just like them.

327
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:08,382
Granddaddy and his boys
used to drive his longhorns...

328
00:36:08,454 --> 00:36:11,302
great herds of them,
all the way to Kansas.

329
00:36:14,277 --> 00:36:17,574
He was a pretty good old boy.
I mean, he was tough, too.

330
00:36:20,903 --> 00:36:24,199
My old man brought in stock from Europe
and bred them in the best ways.

331
00:36:24,263 --> 00:36:25,212
Look out!

332
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:32,160
This right here is the result, honey.

333
00:36:32,711 --> 00:36:34,117
Look at them.

334
00:37:27,271 --> 00:37:28,516
How are you doing?

335
00:37:31,527 --> 00:37:32,607
Tired, honey?

336
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:34,756
Don't you worry about me.

337
00:37:36,231 --> 00:37:37,955
I'm a tough Texan now.

338
00:37:42,374 --> 00:37:44,034
You know, I love you, Tex.

339
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,276
Howdy, everybody.

340
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,789
Hold on a minute. I want you
to take Mrs. Benedict back in with you.

341
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,958
Go with Jett, and get out of this heat.

342
00:38:13,063 --> 00:38:14,491
Honey, I'm fine, really.

343
00:38:14,566 --> 00:38:17,153
There's no use overdoing it.
Go along with Jett.

344
00:38:33,992 --> 00:38:35,367
Good morning, Jett.

345
00:38:36,712 --> 00:38:37,921
Take it easy, Jett.

346
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,254
I don't want to chew on this, Bick...

347
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:47,363
but I think we'd better get it straight.

348
00:38:47,848 --> 00:38:49,570
I run the house, don't I?

349
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,640
Her house. Her kitchen. Her help.

350
00:38:53,352 --> 00:38:54,946
She doesn't even speak Spanish.

351
00:38:55,016 --> 00:38:57,089
They understand English
when they want to.

352
00:38:57,159 --> 00:39:00,226
I know how to handle Mexicans.
I've done it all my life.

353
00:39:01,129 --> 00:39:04,323
They'd sit on their honkers all day
if I didn't keep after them.

354
00:39:04,422 --> 00:39:06,017
All right, Luz. Cool off.

355
00:39:09,031 --> 00:39:11,965
I thought we ought to talk
without her around.

356
00:39:15,016 --> 00:39:18,082
I don't want to feel that you're setting up
against me, Bick.

357
00:39:22,792 --> 00:39:25,029
Nobody is setting up against you, Luz.

358
00:39:26,184 --> 00:39:27,809
That gal's my wife.

359
00:39:29,001 --> 00:39:32,415
And you're fair enough, I think,
to try and get along with her.

360
00:39:36,456 --> 00:39:37,568
All right.

361
00:39:38,345 --> 00:39:41,191
I'll get a horse and help push
the stock along.

362
00:39:41,766 --> 00:39:43,623
Maybe it'll make me feel better.

363
00:39:44,072 --> 00:39:45,860
You gotta push something.

364
00:39:46,439 --> 00:39:48,807
When I get enough, I'll ride on in.

365
00:39:53,065 --> 00:39:55,072
Why did you come to Texas?

366
00:39:56,201 --> 00:39:59,680
I mean, everybody else's trying
to get away from here.

367
00:40:00,391 --> 00:40:02,782
Me, I'll get out of here one of these days.

368
00:40:04,968 --> 00:40:06,657
This is my husband's land.

369
00:40:07,687 --> 00:40:09,117
This is his home.

370
00:40:13,385 --> 00:40:17,314
Who gets hold of this much land
unless they took it off somebody else?

371
00:40:19,017 --> 00:40:21,832
You're not exactly loyal
to your employer, Jett.

372
00:40:21,929 --> 00:40:24,230
No, I'm not complaining.

373
00:40:25,447 --> 00:40:27,336
They bought this land long ago.

374
00:40:27,944 --> 00:40:29,123
The Benedicts.

375
00:40:29,737 --> 00:40:33,992
- They got it though purchase, years ago.
- Took it from some ignorant Mexicans.

376
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:38,049
That's not true. They bought and traded
for Spanish land grants.

377
00:40:39,529 --> 00:40:43,107
They paid for it all right.
They paid five cents an acre.

378
00:40:44,392 --> 00:40:47,262
I know my folks were here long enough
to get rich, too.

379
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,685
Except they just weren't too foxy.

380
00:41:35,305 --> 00:41:37,377
Keep it on, boy. I'll ride him.

381
00:41:39,529 --> 00:41:41,352
Nobody rides him but the "señora".

382
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,751
I've been riding what I want to
for 30 years.

383
00:41:44,233 --> 00:41:45,793
Already he bucked off López.

384
00:41:45,865 --> 00:41:48,899
If he bucks me down,
he won't be the first one that's done it.

385
00:41:51,144 --> 00:41:54,375
I suppose you came out here
to show me how to run things, too.

386
00:41:55,466 --> 00:41:56,413
Let's go.

387
00:42:12,617 --> 00:42:14,559
I'm not too awful bad now.

388
00:42:15,721 --> 00:42:19,234
I've got a few friends.
And "Madama" likes me.

389
00:42:20,553 --> 00:42:24,709
And Bick...
Now, even old Bick likes me a little bit.

390
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:30,208
Of course,
they don't like me quite enough to...

391
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,881
kind of divvy up
what they got way too much of.

392
00:42:39,529 --> 00:42:43,271
You're an odd one, aren't you, Jett?
But I like you.

393
00:42:51,306 --> 00:42:52,767
I like you, too.

394
00:42:54,569 --> 00:42:58,725
You're the best-looking gal
we've seen around here in a long time.

395
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:05,414
The prettiest one
I think I've seen down here.

396
00:43:06,025 --> 00:43:07,453
Thank you, Jett.

397
00:43:07,978 --> 00:43:09,865
That's a very nice compliment.

398
00:43:10,857 --> 00:43:13,540
I'll tell my husband of that,
with your approval.

399
00:43:18,665 --> 00:43:20,488
No, I wouldn't do that.

400
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:26,214
No, I wouldn't do that.

401
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:02,245
Beautiful Reata!

402
00:44:03,978 --> 00:44:06,216
Them's your neighbors live there.

403
00:44:06,858 --> 00:44:09,247
Them kids there.
Them's your ranch people.

404
00:44:10,473 --> 00:44:12,547
Those are Ángel Obregón's kids.

405
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:15,239
That's the man who met us at the train.

406
00:44:17,162 --> 00:44:20,293
Sure in good shape, ain't they?
Whole bunch of them sick.

407
00:44:20,363 --> 00:44:21,989
What's the matter with them?

408
00:44:22,057 --> 00:44:24,742
I don't know. Just sick. Every one of them.

409
00:44:27,114 --> 00:44:29,089
Wait a minute. I want to get out here.

410
00:44:29,161 --> 00:44:31,235
I wouldn't do that if I was you.

411
00:44:31,978 --> 00:44:33,157
Wait.

412
00:44:36,394 --> 00:44:39,242
You're the boss.
And you know it, don't you?

413
00:44:42,602 --> 00:44:43,811
May I come in?

414
00:44:50,698 --> 00:44:52,291
I'm Mrs. Benedict.

415
00:44:53,641 --> 00:44:54,887
"Perdoname"...

416
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:57,509
that I do not rise.

417
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:02,440
The baby is sick.

418
00:45:03,243 --> 00:45:04,834
My milk is not good.

419
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:30,213
Have you seen a doctor?

420
00:46:31,339 --> 00:46:34,536
Doctor? It is too far to come.

421
00:46:37,964 --> 00:46:41,312
Mrs. Leslie,
I think we'd better be getting on.

422
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,734
This baby is extremely ill.

423
00:46:46,506 --> 00:46:48,448
You're not supposed to be in there.

424
00:46:50,284 --> 00:46:53,577
Try not to worry, Mrs. Obregón.
I'll be back soon.

425
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:57,472
Bick's going to blow a gasket.

426
00:47:11,627 --> 00:47:12,837
What is it?

427
00:47:13,643 --> 00:47:15,398
What's happened to him?

428
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:17,732
What's wrong?

429
00:47:33,291 --> 00:47:36,937
Where in the world have you been?
I've been looking for you, too.

430
00:47:38,347 --> 00:47:39,842
What happened to her?

431
00:47:40,907 --> 00:47:42,629
I stopped by the village.

432
00:47:43,499 --> 00:47:44,776
What happened?

433
00:47:45,227 --> 00:47:46,276
It's just awful.

434
00:47:47,851 --> 00:47:51,048
I don't know. She was riding War Winds.

435
00:47:52,235 --> 00:47:54,471
She might have been thrown
or something.

436
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:01,220
What does the doctor say?

437
00:48:03,692 --> 00:48:05,067
It's bad.

438
00:48:05,643 --> 00:48:07,880
She hit her head on a mesquite stump.

439
00:48:18,891 --> 00:48:21,128
She's been riding since she was six.

440
00:48:22,027 --> 00:48:25,541
She could ride anything.
And now this happens.

441
00:48:48,845 --> 00:48:49,890
How is she?

442
00:48:50,476 --> 00:48:52,746
She's in a state of shock. Very serious.

443
00:48:53,292 --> 00:48:55,297
Concussion, possible hemorrhaging.

444
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:57,217
I'm doing all I can do.

445
00:48:57,611 --> 00:48:59,978
I called Dr. Borneholm on the phone.

446
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,336
He'll be along any minute.

447
00:50:17,995 --> 00:50:20,264
If only I hadn't bought that horse...

448
00:50:21,387 --> 00:50:23,297
Don't blame yourself, Jordan.

449
00:50:26,412 --> 00:50:29,062
If I hadn't, she'd be alive right now.

450
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:31,586
Don't blame yourself.

451
00:50:33,451 --> 00:50:37,281
This is a great misfortune,
but no one is to blame.

452
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:43,016
Things happen.

453
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,864
- Mrs. Benedict, this is Dr. Borneholm.
- How do you do?

454
00:51:03,373 --> 00:51:05,413
I sure wish I could've made it for Luz.

455
00:51:05,486 --> 00:51:08,682
Dr. Walker did everything he could,
I assure you of that.

456
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:16,168
Dr. Walker, there's more for you to do,
I'm afraid.

457
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:19,360
Mrs. Obregón's baby is very sick.

458
00:51:19,564 --> 00:51:24,038
His temperature must be at least 105.
Will you stop by, please?

459
00:51:24,782 --> 00:51:25,958
Mrs. Obregón?

460
00:51:26,445 --> 00:51:27,906
In the village.

461
00:51:28,812 --> 00:51:30,187
Jett will take you.

462
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,898
I'll go with you myself, Doctor.

463
00:51:47,118 --> 00:51:48,426
What is this?

464
00:51:49,293 --> 00:51:50,786
You can't do that.

465
00:51:51,277 --> 00:51:52,586
He can't go there.

466
00:51:53,261 --> 00:51:54,603
He's our doctor.

467
00:51:55,502 --> 00:51:57,126
- Our doctor?
- Yes.

468
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,596
You mean, the Benedicts' only?

469
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:02,529
No, I mean, all of us.

470
00:52:03,947 --> 00:52:05,989
He doesn't tend those people.

471
00:52:08,302 --> 00:52:10,984
They have a way of doing things
by themselves.

472
00:52:13,389 --> 00:52:14,850
How did she get there?

473
00:52:15,404 --> 00:52:19,235
Now, don't go climbing on me.
I don't feel too good about it.

474
00:52:19,597 --> 00:52:22,825
Jordan, darling,
I don't think you quite understand.

475
00:52:23,405 --> 00:52:26,722
There's a child who's very sick.
I must take Dr. Walker.

476
00:52:28,557 --> 00:52:30,411
You'll go, won't you, Doctor?

477
00:52:33,006 --> 00:52:35,207
I'll be back just as soon as I can.

478
00:53:24,204 --> 00:53:25,962
I'm a lot better, honey.

479
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,418
That's a good boy.

480
00:53:36,206 --> 00:53:37,699
Where's my horse?

481
00:53:42,604 --> 00:53:43,685
I shot him.

482
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:47,597
Bone was broken.

483
00:53:49,261 --> 00:53:52,328
Somebody had to do it.
I thought it'd be better if it was me.

484
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:58,212
The baby?

485
00:54:00,047 --> 00:54:02,696
He is alive, thanks to Dr. Walker.

486
00:54:08,526 --> 00:54:09,475
Good.

487
00:54:21,837 --> 00:54:25,187
We need you in here for a few minutes
if you can break away.

488
00:54:27,118 --> 00:54:28,580
You're sure holding up fine.

489
00:54:28,654 --> 00:54:31,306
In times like this
folks really show what they're made of...

490
00:54:31,376 --> 00:54:33,414
and you're sure holding up fine.

491
00:54:42,511 --> 00:54:44,550
Vern and me thought a lot of Luz.

492
00:54:45,229 --> 00:54:46,921
I guess everybody did.

493
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:48,873
At least everybody came.

494
00:54:49,037 --> 00:54:52,202
It's the biggest gathering for a funeral
I ever saw in Texas.

495
00:54:52,269 --> 00:54:54,473
It's a shame Luz wasn't here to enjoy it.

496
00:54:55,854 --> 00:54:58,985
I mean, she always did like
a big get-together.

497
00:54:59,854 --> 00:55:01,577
She'd have had a fine time.

498
00:55:03,152 --> 00:55:05,388
- Come to see us.
- Thank you. Bye-bye.

499
00:55:05,454 --> 00:55:06,567
Come see us.

500
00:55:09,965 --> 00:55:13,480
I think you'll agree, your sister
was a very generous woman.

501
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:18,696
She wanted that boy
to have something worthwhile.

502
00:55:19,919 --> 00:55:22,023
Now, that little piece of land is worth...

503
00:55:22,094 --> 00:55:24,429
$500, $600 at most.

504
00:55:25,742 --> 00:55:29,572
I'm going to ask you, in reverence
to the memory of Luz Benedict...

505
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:33,220
I'm going to ask you
to give one Jett Rink...

506
00:55:34,031 --> 00:55:36,552
a check for twice the value of that land.

507
00:55:36,878 --> 00:55:39,114
We can clean up the whole matter
right now.

508
00:55:50,095 --> 00:55:51,850
Come inside, I want to talk to you.

509
00:55:51,919 --> 00:55:53,348
Just a minute, Bick.

510
00:55:54,478 --> 00:55:56,714
I'm afraid I'm going to beat you to it.

511
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:58,631
I'm quitting.

512
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:02,825
I lost the one friend I had in this place,
and I know it, too.

513
00:56:03,662 --> 00:56:06,859
So I quit, I dead quit.
You don't have to say another word to me.

514
00:56:07,118 --> 00:56:08,548
Nobody's firing you.

515
00:56:08,815 --> 00:56:10,790
Boy, howdy, nobody's firing me.

516
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,002
I told you, I quit!

517
00:56:13,071 --> 00:56:14,697
Nobody wants to fire you.

518
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,470
Come inside and listen
to what we have to say.

519
00:56:18,894 --> 00:56:21,099
Come on in here, Jett.
Come on in here, boy.

520
00:56:22,798 --> 00:56:24,360
Hi, Jett. Nice to see you.

521
00:56:24,878 --> 00:56:27,050
- Howdy, Jett. Good to see you.
- Howdy, Jett.

522
00:56:27,311 --> 00:56:30,509
Have my seat, boy. Sit right down.
You sure look good today.

523
00:56:31,374 --> 00:56:35,150
Sit down. I'm going to tell you about
a piece of luck that's come your way.

524
00:56:35,215 --> 00:56:38,248
Sit down, young man,
and make yourself comfortable.

525
00:56:39,023 --> 00:56:42,406
It's a real bad wind
that doesn't blow somebody some good.

526
00:56:45,551 --> 00:56:50,056
I don't have to tell you that Luz was
a woman of strong, sentimental feeling.

527
00:56:53,103 --> 00:56:57,259
She prepared a list of things she wanted
to give all the people on Reata.

528
00:56:57,584 --> 00:57:00,398
Yes. We find that she wanted to...

529
00:57:01,808 --> 00:57:06,279
We find that her bequest to you was
in the nature of a little piece of ground.

530
00:57:07,792 --> 00:57:10,661
It's the little piece we used to call
Buffalo Wallow.

531
00:57:16,143 --> 00:57:19,013
She wanted to give you something.
I know she did.

532
00:57:20,782 --> 00:57:25,094
It's always been my aim to try
to keep Reata intact within the family.

533
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:31,141
Now, that little piece is worth at most...
How much, Bale?

534
00:57:31,567 --> 00:57:34,436
At the most, I'd say $500 or $600, Bick.

535
00:57:36,144 --> 00:57:39,178
Mr. Benedict, wanting to honor
his sister's wishes...

536
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:43,341
and, of course, right along
with his own personal feeling for you...

537
00:57:44,015 --> 00:57:47,692
He wants to see to it that you get
something really worthwhile.

538
00:57:48,176 --> 00:57:50,991
Now, to get down to the point, Mr. Rink...

539
00:57:51,505 --> 00:57:54,950
we're prepared to place in your hands,
in cash...

540
00:57:55,536 --> 00:57:58,437
the sum of $1,200.

541
00:58:10,032 --> 00:58:11,438
$1,200...

542
00:58:12,046 --> 00:58:15,976
which, any of these gentlemen here
I'm sure will be happy to tell you...

543
00:58:16,047 --> 00:58:18,087
is twice the value of that land.

544
00:58:18,158 --> 00:58:21,705
- Definitely.
- At least twice the value of that land.

545
00:58:35,855 --> 00:58:39,684
That's a lot of money.
What are you aiming do with all of it?

546
00:58:40,368 --> 00:58:42,278
You're in the chips now, boy.

547
00:58:43,214 --> 00:58:45,419
There it is. There it is, boy.

548
00:58:46,576 --> 00:58:48,266
And it's all yours.

549
00:58:56,112 --> 00:58:57,704
I don't know what to say.

550
00:59:01,615 --> 00:59:03,111
She sure was a fine lady.

551
00:59:03,184 --> 00:59:05,421
Yes, she was a fine lady. Hallelujah!

552
00:59:05,681 --> 00:59:06,627
Amen.

553
00:59:15,055 --> 00:59:18,635
I want you to know
that I appreciate her generosity.

554
00:59:20,175 --> 00:59:22,379
Yours, too, Bick. And you all.

555
00:59:23,632 --> 00:59:25,257
I want to thank you for it.

556
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,661
You know something, Bick?

557
00:59:32,431 --> 00:59:35,498
I don't know, but it might not be...

558
00:59:35,727 --> 00:59:39,558
a pretty good idea
to gamble along with old "Madama".

559
00:59:42,257 --> 00:59:43,434
How do you mean?

560
00:59:44,815 --> 00:59:46,026
Just gamble on.

561
00:59:47,759 --> 00:59:49,451
Just keep what she gave me.

562
00:59:55,791 --> 00:59:57,732
I'm sentimental, too, Bick.

563
01:00:02,351 --> 01:00:05,994
I think it's good to gamble on with her.

564
01:00:08,367 --> 01:00:10,570
I know that land ain't worth much...

565
01:00:10,638 --> 01:00:14,533
but then someday I just might up...

566
01:00:15,245 --> 01:00:17,417
and put my own fence around her...

567
01:00:18,574 --> 01:00:20,516
and call her Little Reata.

568
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:27,588
See you.

569
01:00:33,103 --> 01:00:36,899
There's one thing on this earth more
important than money, and that's land!

570
01:00:36,973 --> 01:00:39,431
I heard Luz say it a thousand times.

571
01:00:39,503 --> 01:00:41,990
Pa said it and Bick, too. And it's true!

572
01:00:42,223 --> 01:00:45,322
If you ever get to Deep Smith,
you come and pay us a visit.

573
01:00:45,551 --> 01:00:47,689
We're just on the other side of Umbarger.

574
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,957
Only a little-bitty, no-account piece,
only we had a run of luck.

575
01:00:51,023 --> 01:00:54,284
- Only? Why, a gusher came in last year.
- How wonderful.

576
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:56,554
Right now it's bringing in a million.

577
01:00:56,622 --> 01:00:58,762
- A million gallons?
- Dollars.

578
01:00:59,214 --> 01:01:00,741
A million dollars a year?

579
01:01:00,815 --> 01:01:02,473
A million dollars a month.

580
01:01:04,368 --> 01:01:07,268
- Goodbye. Thanks for treating us right.
- Thank you for coming.

581
01:03:35,888 --> 01:03:38,440
I just love talking to you, Uncle Bawley.

582
01:03:40,305 --> 01:03:42,508
Now that it's over, you get your fellow...

583
01:03:42,576 --> 01:03:44,746
to take you around
and show you our country.

584
01:03:45,553 --> 01:03:48,749
See San Antonio, Dallas and Houston.

585
01:03:49,231 --> 01:03:52,527
I'm so impatient.
I want to see it all right now.

586
01:03:53,935 --> 01:03:57,733
You don't have to hurry, honey.
It'll be here when you get around to it.

587
01:03:58,833 --> 01:04:00,620
It's been here a long time.

588
01:04:02,032 --> 01:04:05,863
And when you've seen it all
and have lived with it as I have...

589
01:04:07,663 --> 01:04:11,374
in 25 years from now,
you'll feel about Texas just like I do.

590
01:04:12,336 --> 01:04:14,376
Twenty-five years from now!

591
01:04:14,927 --> 01:04:17,646
Twenty-five years from now
I'll be almost 50.

592
01:04:18,895 --> 01:04:20,489
It's a nice age, Leslie.

593
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:24,293
You'll see wonderful things in Texas
when you're 50.

594
01:04:26,607 --> 01:04:27,720
Perhaps.

595
01:04:29,266 --> 01:04:31,118
But I won't care as much then.

596
01:04:31,376 --> 01:04:32,652
You'll care more.

597
01:04:33,264 --> 01:04:36,612
Because then
you'll have been part of it all.

598
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,669
Come on, we need you in the powwow.

599
01:04:38,928 --> 01:04:40,236
I'm coming, gentlemen.

600
01:04:49,264 --> 01:04:51,817
You get with it, Gomez.
Get your people out.

601
01:04:52,177 --> 01:04:55,276
I don't want any of them
sitting on their honkers come election day.

602
01:04:55,343 --> 01:04:58,213
Everything will be "bueno, señor".
It will be the same: Good.

603
01:05:09,008 --> 01:05:10,185
I love you.

604
01:05:13,136 --> 01:05:14,150
Thank you.

605
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:17,646
We're just talking business. Just business.

606
01:05:19,185 --> 01:05:21,005
Please, don't mind me.

607
01:05:22,383 --> 01:05:23,464
Do go on.

608
01:05:25,553 --> 01:05:27,853
I'll listen, quiet as a little old mouse.

609
01:05:30,289 --> 01:05:31,783
You'd be bored, honey.

610
01:05:32,144 --> 01:05:33,453
This is dull.

611
01:05:34,224 --> 01:05:36,297
Why, I'd be fascinated.

612
01:05:39,024 --> 01:05:40,935
We're talking about politics.

613
01:05:42,769 --> 01:05:45,639
You married me in Washington,
remember, darling?

614
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:49,194
I lived next door to politics.
Brought up with it.

615
01:05:50,097 --> 01:05:52,484
Please go on talking. I'd love it.

616
01:05:53,776 --> 01:05:55,238
This is men's stuff.

617
01:05:56,273 --> 01:05:59,569
Leslie, how about a cup of coffee
or a drink?

618
01:06:03,538 --> 01:06:04,649
Men's stuff!

619
01:06:06,834 --> 01:06:08,327
Lord have mercy!

620
01:06:10,481 --> 01:06:14,637
Set up my spinning wheel, girls.
I'll join the harem section in a minute.

621
01:06:16,273 --> 01:06:19,469
Don't you go worrying
your pretty little head about politics.

622
01:06:20,113 --> 01:06:22,830
You mean my pretty, empty head,
don't you, Judge?

623
01:06:26,033 --> 01:06:27,921
Could I get the coffee for you?

624
01:06:30,288 --> 01:06:32,590
You, too, Uncle Brutus?

625
01:06:34,898 --> 01:06:36,807
You don't feel well, Leslie.

626
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:39,276
I feel just great!

627
01:06:39,922 --> 01:06:42,571
My adrenaline glands
are pumping beautifully.

628
01:06:46,417 --> 01:06:48,783
If I may say so before retiring...

629
01:06:49,553 --> 01:06:52,652
you gentlemen date back 100,000 years.

630
01:06:54,033 --> 01:06:57,229
You ought to be wearing leopard skins
and carrying clubs.

631
01:06:57,457 --> 01:06:58,538
Politics!

632
01:06:59,057 --> 01:07:00,137
Business!

633
01:07:01,007 --> 01:07:04,839
What's so masculine about a conversation
that a woman can't enter into it?

634
01:07:07,344 --> 01:07:08,752
Leslie, you're tired.

635
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:14,189
Perhaps I am.

636
01:07:31,184 --> 01:07:34,055
I reckon I'll go on upstairs
and get my beauty sleep.

637
01:07:34,321 --> 01:07:35,816
You go ahead on, honey.

638
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:39,782
Good night, gentlemen.

639
01:07:50,194 --> 01:07:51,503
That's right.

640
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:55,498
Send the children on up to bed
so the grownups can talk.

641
01:07:59,633 --> 01:08:00,878
Good night, honey.

642
01:08:36,274 --> 01:08:37,833
I must have dropped off.

643
01:08:40,881 --> 01:08:44,495
Darling, I am sorry
about my caveman speech.

644
01:08:46,642 --> 01:08:49,675
I'll apologize to the others first thing,
I promise.

645
01:08:49,873 --> 01:08:51,184
That's big of you.

646
01:08:51,891 --> 01:08:54,441
You certainly distinguished yourself
this evening.

647
01:08:54,513 --> 01:08:57,036
- Shh, they can hear.
- Hear? They heard you already.

648
01:08:57,107 --> 01:09:00,683
Every word you said out there.
We date back 100,000 years.

649
01:09:01,489 --> 01:09:04,043
I said I was sorry about the name-calling.

650
01:09:05,394 --> 01:09:07,304
It was very impolite, I know.

651
01:09:08,178 --> 01:09:10,763
But in principle, I was absolutely right.

652
01:09:11,025 --> 01:09:14,409
You come down here
and try to tell us how to run things.

653
01:09:14,482 --> 01:09:16,752
Insulting my friends and everything.

654
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:18,920
Now you look here, Leslie.

655
01:09:19,795 --> 01:09:22,348
You're my wife, Mrs. Jordan Benedict.

656
01:09:23,027 --> 01:09:27,302
I'm asking you, when will you settle down
and behave like everybody else?

657
01:09:28,594 --> 01:09:30,960
- Never!
- Who do you think you are, anyhow?

658
01:09:31,026 --> 01:09:32,880
Joan of Arc, or something?

659
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:49,806
Jordan, where are you going?

660
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:53,832
Jordan, take off your hat.

661
01:09:56,402 --> 01:09:58,605
Carrying on like Carrie Nation!

662
01:09:58,674 --> 01:10:01,543
Preaching stuff that's none
of your business, fixing the world.

663
01:10:01,617 --> 01:10:02,895
Why don't you join a club?

664
01:10:02,961 --> 01:10:06,279
Honestly, Jordan.
You make me sound just awful.

665
01:10:09,779 --> 01:10:11,271
I'm not all that bad.

666
01:10:12,243 --> 01:10:14,960
You knew what a frightful girl I was
when you married me.

667
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:17,646
I did not deceive you, sir.

668
01:10:18,482 --> 01:10:22,474
From the first moment,
I couldn't have been more unpleasant.

669
01:10:25,874 --> 01:10:27,978
Anyway, you're stuck with me.

670
01:10:32,817 --> 01:10:34,728
Yes, I guess.

671
01:10:37,843 --> 01:10:39,697
Honey, take your hat off.

672
01:10:53,267 --> 01:10:54,445
Besides...

673
01:10:55,187 --> 01:10:56,812
you love me very much.

674
01:11:03,667 --> 01:11:06,449
That fine mind of yours
gets pretty repulsive at times.

675
01:11:08,051 --> 01:11:10,286
That's not what you told me on the train.

676
01:11:12,177 --> 01:11:14,251
Now you're gonna throw that up to me.

677
01:11:14,931 --> 01:11:16,175
I thought what we...

678
01:11:17,842 --> 01:11:20,364
I thought what we said on the train
was in confidence.

679
01:11:21,715 --> 01:11:23,471
Of course, darling.

680
01:11:25,074 --> 01:11:27,944
But I'll never forget a single word
you say to me.

681
01:11:28,945 --> 01:11:31,215
You can be pretty wonderful at times.

682
01:11:43,955 --> 01:11:45,199
Come on, partner.

683
01:11:46,324 --> 01:11:48,527
Why don't you kick off your spurs?

684
01:12:08,242 --> 01:12:11,439
What a glorious, gorgeous,
brand-new day!

685
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:16,265
Let's spend every hour of it, just you and I.

686
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,060
Honey, I'm beat.

687
01:12:18,739 --> 01:12:19,687
Why?

688
01:12:21,523 --> 01:12:24,207
You have all the good things in the world.

689
01:12:24,403 --> 01:12:27,250
And a woman
who loves you very, very much.

690
01:12:36,596 --> 01:12:39,247
But that arguing takes a lot out of me.

691
01:12:44,883 --> 01:12:46,541
That was just frightful.

692
01:12:49,204 --> 01:12:51,757
The best part about quarreling
is making up.

693
01:12:53,683 --> 01:12:56,497
When we make up, we make up.
Don't we, honey?

694
01:12:59,346 --> 01:13:03,821
Why can't we take a trip, really see Texas?
Just let somebody else run Reata.

695
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:05,965
Couldn't we?

696
01:13:07,956 --> 01:13:10,029
Honey, I want you to understand this.

697
01:13:10,546 --> 01:13:12,621
I run Reata at all times.

698
01:13:13,843 --> 01:13:15,271
That's the way it is.

699
01:13:16,435 --> 01:13:18,857
Everything that's in it and on it
is run by me.

700
01:13:19,987 --> 01:13:21,164
Don't raise your voice.

701
01:13:21,266 --> 01:13:23,240
That's the way it's always been.

702
01:13:23,636 --> 01:13:26,735
Everything that has a Reata brand on it
is run by me.

703
01:13:29,459 --> 01:13:31,085
Does that include me?

704
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:37,773
That's the way my father ran this outfit
and my grandfather, too. All of it.

705
01:13:38,421 --> 01:13:41,137
He kept it together for his son,
and my father for his.

706
01:13:41,491 --> 01:13:43,881
And I'm keeping it together for mine.

707
01:13:44,532 --> 01:13:46,320
All 595,000 square miles?

708
01:13:46,419 --> 01:13:47,794
All of it. For my son.

709
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:51,211
You could at least say "our son".

710
01:13:52,212 --> 01:13:53,160
Our son.

711
01:13:54,996 --> 01:13:58,193
Don't you think that might be
a little too much for one little baby?

712
01:13:58,611 --> 01:14:00,204
Not if he's a Benedict.

713
01:14:05,332 --> 01:14:07,241
You'd better hope this is a boy.

714
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:13,545
Our baby. I just said I'm hoping it's a boy.

715
01:14:15,765 --> 01:14:17,041
What do you mean?

716
01:14:18,067 --> 01:14:19,661
Why didn't you tell me?

717
01:14:21,269 --> 01:14:22,926
I'm telling you now.

718
01:14:27,028 --> 01:14:30,224
Why didn't you tell me?
I mean, I should know.

719
01:14:32,595 --> 01:14:34,157
- Are you sure?
- Sure.

720
01:14:36,372 --> 01:14:39,689
And our baby is going to be a boy.
I know it.

721
01:14:41,107 --> 01:14:43,279
A boy very much like his father.

722
01:14:47,348 --> 01:14:48,625
In many ways...

723
01:14:50,259 --> 01:14:51,504
but not all.

724
01:15:00,372 --> 01:15:02,510
Shouldn't she be putting on
a little weight?

725
01:15:05,429 --> 01:15:08,940
It's natural, I think,
for him to be gaining faster.

726
01:15:10,003 --> 01:15:11,049
Let me see.

727
01:15:16,275 --> 01:15:17,421
Very heavy.

728
01:15:24,755 --> 01:15:26,098
Hello, sweetheart.

729
01:15:27,317 --> 01:15:28,909
He's building up fine.

730
01:15:30,229 --> 01:15:32,138
"I am now stronger than ever.

731
01:15:32,212 --> 01:15:35,726
"I'm helping a young Dr. Guerra
get started here.

732
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:40,201
"Almost every day I find myself
walking three or four miles...

733
01:15:41,044 --> 01:15:45,354
"through the dusty and dirty streets
of Vientecito village".

734
01:15:54,933 --> 01:15:56,842
Hello, Ángel. How are you?

735
01:15:57,525 --> 01:15:58,733
Good.

736
01:16:04,372 --> 01:16:07,274
I'd like to speak to Mr. Gomez, the boss.

737
01:16:07,348 --> 01:16:09,170
The man that runs this place.

738
01:16:09,237 --> 01:16:11,625
Mrs. Benedict, what is it I can do?

739
01:16:12,403 --> 01:16:15,601
Mr. Gomez, I'm going to leave
Dr. Guerra here with you.

740
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:18,355
He'll tell you things
that must be done immediately.

741
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:20,463
This place is a scandal.

742
01:16:22,133 --> 01:16:24,849
Thank you, Dr. Guerra.
I'll get in touch with you.

743
01:16:58,036 --> 01:16:59,117
Hello, Jett.

744
01:16:59,861 --> 01:17:01,900
- Howdy, Miss Leslie.
- How are you?

745
01:17:03,253 --> 01:17:04,234
I'm doing good.

746
01:17:05,622 --> 01:17:08,141
- You made some improvements.
- Do you like it?

747
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:09,518
It looks good.

748
01:17:16,277 --> 01:17:18,959
It ain't much yet, but it's coming along.

749
01:17:19,668 --> 01:17:21,425
I wouldn't have believed it.

750
01:17:21,493 --> 01:17:22,834
Believed what?

751
01:17:23,221 --> 01:17:27,149
Truthfully, I didn't expect this sort
of talent to be one of your virtues.

752
01:17:29,237 --> 01:17:32,586
That's the first time I was ever accused
of having any of that.

753
01:17:36,662 --> 01:17:39,530
It really is nice, Jett. Real nice.

754
01:17:41,014 --> 01:17:42,061
Someday...

755
01:17:42,326 --> 01:17:45,108
I'll have a place
that no one will be ashamed of.

756
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:56,016
I cut them out of the newspaper.

757
01:17:56,085 --> 01:17:59,401
I thought maybe they'd kind of
dress the place up a little bit.

758
01:18:00,565 --> 01:18:01,611
Sweet of you.

759
01:18:12,053 --> 01:18:15,249
Do you want to come on in here,
sit down and rest a minute?

760
01:18:15,542 --> 01:18:16,488
Thank you.

761
01:18:27,126 --> 01:18:29,907
Having kids seems to agree with you,
you know?

762
01:18:30,774 --> 01:18:33,011
You're looking prettier than ever.

763
01:18:34,389 --> 01:18:35,883
Just as good, anyway.

764
01:18:50,710 --> 01:18:52,497
My goodness, and tea!

765
01:18:52,951 --> 01:18:54,258
You like tea, don't you?

766
01:18:54,325 --> 01:18:58,068
I love it. It seems down here everybody
drinks gallons of coffee.

767
01:18:59,255 --> 01:19:00,300
I know.

768
01:19:17,269 --> 01:19:19,790
Mind if I pay you
a rather personal compliment?

769
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:24,203
What is it?

770
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:27,338
You make a very excellent cup of tea.

771
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:32,844
I do a lot of things in a pinch.

772
01:19:38,901 --> 01:19:42,162
Do you like one lump or do you like two?

773
01:19:43,381 --> 01:19:45,291
I think I'll take mine straight.

774
01:19:46,261 --> 01:19:47,920
That's good enough for me.

775
01:19:56,309 --> 01:19:58,001
That's not too good, is it?

776
01:19:58,870 --> 01:20:00,779
When will you get married, Jett?

777
01:20:01,302 --> 01:20:05,131
Don't you need somebody to help you
with this kind of responsibility?

778
01:20:06,551 --> 01:20:10,226
When I get some time to look around,
I'll go back East and...

779
01:20:10,903 --> 01:20:12,942
To Maryland, places like that.

780
01:20:13,558 --> 01:20:17,869
You got any attractive sisters there that
might be interested in some poor people?

781
01:20:19,541 --> 01:20:21,450
Money isn't all, you know?

782
01:20:23,255 --> 01:20:25,078
Not when you've got it.

783
01:20:32,247 --> 01:20:34,156
The other people around here...

784
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:37,237
why don't they help themselves
like you've done?

785
01:20:38,966 --> 01:20:42,382
When you say "other people",
what do you mean?

786
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:49,077
I've just come back from Vientecito.

787
01:20:49,718 --> 01:20:51,725
That bunch of wetbacks?

788
01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:55,028
You don't go mixing me up
with none of them.

789
01:20:55,894 --> 01:21:00,335
I'm just as much of Texas
as Bick Benedict is.

790
01:21:04,631 --> 01:21:06,606
- I'm no wetback.
- I know that.

791
01:21:08,951 --> 01:21:12,725
You're very like Jordan in that respect.
Attitude, everything.

792
01:21:13,846 --> 01:21:17,042
But your situation is so different.
You're a working man.

793
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,555
That's something I'm gonna try to fix.

794
01:21:22,965 --> 01:21:24,560
Someday I will.

795
01:21:27,062 --> 01:21:28,273
All right, Gomez.

796
01:21:32,598 --> 01:21:34,005
Yes, I understand.

797
01:21:34,326 --> 01:21:35,570
Yes, thank you.

798
01:21:38,423 --> 01:21:40,495
Thanks for the tea party, Jett.

799
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:43,214
And don't be such a stranger.

800
01:21:45,655 --> 01:21:47,541
Stop by and pay us a visit.

801
01:21:48,757 --> 01:21:50,418
I don't know about that.

802
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:52,788
Bick's still got his kettle on for me.

803
01:22:12,150 --> 01:22:13,328
Leslie.

804
01:22:14,742 --> 01:22:16,019
Hello, darling.

805
01:22:17,975 --> 01:22:19,916
I was just having tea with Jett Rink.

806
01:22:19,990 --> 01:22:22,860
Gomez telephoned.
"Mrs. Benedict went to Vientecito.

807
01:22:23,287 --> 01:22:25,261
"I hope you're not displeased", he said.

808
01:22:25,333 --> 01:22:28,204
I've told you before...
What's this about Jett Rink?

809
01:22:28,696 --> 01:22:31,563
He made tea. Isn't that unbelievable?

810
01:22:32,470 --> 01:22:34,357
He does so want to improve himself.

811
01:22:36,121 --> 01:22:38,967
But your man Gomez, that camp he runs...

812
01:22:40,888 --> 01:22:41,836
It's hopeless.

813
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:44,910
You can't go around this place
with no regard for who you are...

814
01:22:44,983 --> 01:22:46,674
interfering with those people.

815
01:22:47,031 --> 01:22:49,202
Jordan, that place is a scandal.

816
01:22:49,942 --> 01:22:51,950
Dr. Guerra threw his hands up in horror.

817
01:22:52,183 --> 01:22:53,743
That's his problem.

818
01:22:54,199 --> 01:22:57,515
You've been a powerful Texan for
100 years. Why don't you do something?

819
01:22:57,591 --> 01:22:59,566
I'm not the Red Cross, I'm a cow man.

820
01:22:59,736 --> 01:23:01,230
If you won't, I will.

821
01:23:01,303 --> 01:23:03,158
If you go near those dumps again...

822
01:23:03,223 --> 01:23:06,006
if I ever hear you get mixed up
in this migratory mess...

823
01:23:06,072 --> 01:23:07,446
- What?
- I'll leave you!

824
01:23:07,639 --> 01:23:09,842
That's what I'll do, I'll leave you!

825
01:23:13,561 --> 01:23:16,177
There's my darling little girl.

826
01:23:17,078 --> 01:23:21,235
Did you think your naughty mama was
never going to come up to see you?

827
01:23:21,878 --> 01:23:23,767
One thing you can be sure of:

828
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:27,246
One of these days I'll run
that Jett Rink's hide out of this country.

829
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,878
Say hello to Luz. Say, "Hello, Luz".

830
01:23:56,791 --> 01:23:59,441
Look there. Say hello to little Luz.

831
01:24:03,256 --> 01:24:06,125
I don't care what you say.
She does look like Luz.

832
01:24:06,648 --> 01:24:08,054
Oh, honey.

833
01:24:09,721 --> 01:24:12,754
We're all gathered for the fourth
anniversary of my son's birth.

834
01:24:13,496 --> 01:24:14,924
And your daughter's.

835
01:24:17,336 --> 01:24:19,889
And I want to take
this auspicious occasion...

836
01:24:20,535 --> 01:24:22,772
to say that this young fellow here...

837
01:24:23,831 --> 01:24:26,351
is gonna grow up to be
one of Reata's top hands.

838
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:31,149
I mean, this boy's gonna be the best.

839
01:24:32,919 --> 01:24:35,788
Maybe he'll even grow up
to be better than his old man.

840
01:24:36,375 --> 01:24:38,131
Girls, look at the pony.

841
01:24:45,271 --> 01:24:46,516
There he is, son.

842
01:24:47,129 --> 01:24:48,469
He's all yours.

843
01:24:48,982 --> 01:24:50,444
All mine, Daddy?

844
01:25:12,279 --> 01:25:13,709
Take him around, Ángel.

845
01:25:25,526 --> 01:25:26,836
Take it easy, son.

846
01:25:27,385 --> 01:25:28,660
He doesn't want to.

847
01:25:28,792 --> 01:25:30,703
I rode before I could walk.

848
01:25:31,799 --> 01:25:34,833
But that was you.
He's another person entirely.

849
01:25:35,224 --> 01:25:39,731
He is a Benedict. He's gonna stay
on that saddle if I have to tie him on.

850
01:25:57,144 --> 01:25:58,322
Take him away.

851
01:26:02,425 --> 01:26:04,082
- No.
- Let him ride, Polo.

852
01:26:05,239 --> 01:26:06,222
Let him ride.

853
01:26:16,311 --> 01:26:18,865
Take him up for his nap. I think he's tired.

854
01:26:56,569 --> 01:26:58,478
That wasn't so bad, was it, son?

855
01:27:25,241 --> 01:27:28,591
Bick knows everything about running
a ranch. Bone, hide and hair.

856
01:27:31,223 --> 01:27:33,395
He doesn't know a thing
about raising kids...

857
01:27:33,465 --> 01:27:35,353
any more than his father did.

858
01:27:35,705 --> 01:27:37,745
You just stay with it your way...

859
01:27:38,266 --> 01:27:41,561
and help those children grow up to be
what they want to be.

860
01:27:41,913 --> 01:27:44,018
I will, Uncle Bawley. I promise.

861
01:27:48,698 --> 01:27:50,607
We're going to hit the hay.

862
01:27:54,617 --> 01:27:56,854
- Good night, Leslie.
- Good night.

863
01:27:56,922 --> 01:28:01,199
- Good night.
- Good night.

864
01:28:07,417 --> 01:28:09,107
It's time for me to turn in.

865
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:16,052
- Good night, Bick.
- Good night, Bawley.

866
01:28:20,088 --> 01:28:23,438
Good night, everybody.
Don't forget to turn off the rain.

867
01:28:50,042 --> 01:28:51,317
Are you tired?

868
01:28:52,505 --> 01:28:53,454
No.

869
01:28:58,202 --> 01:29:01,550
What's happening is we're getting
on each other's nerves.

870
01:29:01,881 --> 01:29:02,864
Could be.

871
01:29:06,137 --> 01:29:09,367
We've been together every day and night
since we first met.

872
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:12,118
Is that bad?

873
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:14,479
No.

874
01:29:16,825 --> 01:29:19,509
We're getting in the habit
of snapping at each other...

875
01:29:22,874 --> 01:29:25,426
about things
we should've adjusted to years ago.

876
01:29:32,155 --> 01:29:36,627
I think it would be a good idea
if I took the children home for a visit.

877
01:29:38,042 --> 01:29:38,990
Home?

878
01:29:43,770 --> 01:29:45,330
If you're homesick...

879
01:29:46,234 --> 01:29:48,469
I mean, if that's the way you want it.

880
01:29:49,210 --> 01:29:52,059
- That's not the way I want it, Jordan.
- All right, then.

881
01:29:57,466 --> 01:30:00,335
It'll be better for us
if we're apart for a while.

882
01:30:01,914 --> 01:30:03,637
Better for us and the children.

883
01:30:05,882 --> 01:30:08,883
It'll give us both a chance
to think things over.

884
01:30:18,585 --> 01:30:20,113
You know best, I guess.

885
01:30:21,914 --> 01:30:23,474
I think it will be best.

886
01:31:12,794 --> 01:31:14,169
- Hi, there.
- 'Morning.

887
01:31:14,490 --> 01:31:16,084
Fine day for riding.

888
01:31:16,282 --> 01:31:17,688
Just magnificent.

889
01:31:20,027 --> 01:31:21,204
See you later.

890
01:31:24,251 --> 01:31:25,681
She's a lucky girl.

891
01:31:27,130 --> 01:31:30,229
If I had it to do again,
I'd still walk off with Jordan.

892
01:31:31,226 --> 01:31:32,981
Even if I knew it'd end like this.

893
01:31:35,642 --> 01:31:37,464
You have no time to be homesick...

894
01:31:37,531 --> 01:31:40,378
with this wedding and Thanksgiving
on us together.

895
01:31:43,706 --> 01:31:45,299
Pedro, come here.

896
01:31:48,857 --> 01:31:51,095
Pedro, eat your dinner like a good boy.

897
01:32:19,866 --> 01:32:24,406
Merciful Father, we bow our heads
in gratitude on this Thanksgiving Day.

898
01:32:25,371 --> 01:32:28,721
We give thee humble and hearty thanks
for this, thy bounty...

899
01:32:29,818 --> 01:32:32,273
beseeching thee to continue
thy loving kindness...

900
01:32:33,051 --> 01:32:37,874
that our land may still yield her increase,
to thy glory and our comfort.

901
01:32:38,554 --> 01:32:39,503
Amen.

902
01:32:44,794 --> 01:32:46,704
Is that Pedro?

903
01:32:47,708 --> 01:32:49,135
Yes, darling.

904
01:33:30,492 --> 01:33:32,727
It's a day
when we're supposed to be happy.

905
01:33:34,651 --> 01:33:36,212
Come on now, smile.

906
01:33:36,923 --> 01:33:38,134
Like Mommy.

907
01:33:47,227 --> 01:33:48,919
Is something wrong, Miss Leslie?

908
01:33:58,427 --> 01:34:00,499
Now maybe you'll stop crying.

909
01:34:01,308 --> 01:34:03,696
It's a message to you from your father.

910
01:34:04,219 --> 01:34:06,128
Is he gonna be here for dinner?

911
01:34:08,794 --> 01:34:09,743
No...

912
01:34:10,748 --> 01:34:14,392
but he says,
"I hope my darlings are all very happy.

913
01:34:15,547 --> 01:34:20,021
"I want them to know I miss them
very much and love each one very much".

914
01:35:02,107 --> 01:35:06,167
I could see you coming.
Why, Mr. Benedict, this is a good surprise!

915
01:35:08,123 --> 01:35:11,320
We're having a wedding.
Sure is plenty of excitement.

916
01:36:15,292 --> 01:36:16,885
"Dearly beloved...

917
01:36:17,084 --> 01:36:21,558
"we are gathered here in the sight of God
and in the face of this company...

918
01:36:22,172 --> 01:36:26,483
"to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony...

919
01:36:27,228 --> 01:36:30,906
"which is an honorable estate
instituted of God.

920
01:36:32,028 --> 01:36:36,022
"David, wilt thou have this woman
for thy wedded wife?

921
01:36:36,348 --> 01:36:40,822
"To live together after God's ordinance
in the holiest state of matrimony?

922
01:36:41,307 --> 01:36:44,821
"Wilt thou love her, comfort her,
honor her...

923
01:36:45,182 --> 01:36:49,653
"and keep her in sickness and in health,
and forsaking all others...

924
01:36:50,590 --> 01:36:54,418
"keep thee only unto her
so long as you both shall live?"

925
01:36:55,389 --> 01:36:56,338
I will.

926
01:36:57,597 --> 01:37:00,792
"Lacey, wilt thou have this man
for thy wedded husband...

927
01:37:01,277 --> 01:37:05,749
"to live together after God's ordinance
in the holiest state of matrimony?

928
01:37:06,876 --> 01:37:10,453
"Wilt thou love him, comfort him,
honor him...

929
01:37:10,909 --> 01:37:15,611
"and keep him in sickness and in health,
and forsaking all others...

930
01:37:16,381 --> 01:37:20,375
"keep thee only unto him
so long as you both shall live?"

931
01:37:20,477 --> 01:37:21,425
I will.

932
01:37:21,917 --> 01:37:24,153
"Bless, O Lord, this ring...

933
01:37:24,541 --> 01:37:29,014
"that he who gives it and she
who wears it may abide in thy peace...

934
01:37:29,405 --> 01:37:33,496
"and continue in thy favor
unto their life's end.

935
01:37:33,757 --> 01:37:34,704
"Amen".

936
01:37:39,038 --> 01:37:41,044
With this ring, I thee wed.

937
01:37:43,676 --> 01:37:47,986
"Those whom God hath joined together,
let no man put asunder.

938
01:37:49,276 --> 01:37:54,492
"For as much as David and Lacey have
consented together in holy wedlock...

939
01:37:56,285 --> 01:37:59,766
"I pronounce that they are man and wife".

940
01:38:31,484 --> 01:38:34,682
Are you ready to come back
to your old, beat-up cowhand?

941
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:40,370
I'm no different than I was when I left.

942
01:38:42,013 --> 01:38:45,396
We Texans like a little vinegar
with our greens. It gives them flavor.

943
01:39:15,325 --> 01:39:17,081
What do you think of old King Tut?

944
01:39:17,148 --> 01:39:19,157
Boy, howdy, that's some hunk of beef!

945
01:39:19,229 --> 01:39:20,724
He's gonna make history, too.

946
01:39:20,925 --> 01:39:24,121
When Bick finishes this breeding program,
he'll have an animal...

947
01:39:24,412 --> 01:39:27,316
that's 99 percent beef
and the rest exaggeration.

948
01:40:25,757 --> 01:40:28,311
Say, Ollie, do you see that?

949
01:40:29,948 --> 01:40:31,411
That's Rink's truck.

950
01:40:32,094 --> 01:40:34,069
I don't want him
hauling through my place.

951
01:40:35,327 --> 01:40:39,154
Jett's got the easement, Bick.
He's got a right to go through the land.

952
01:40:39,775 --> 01:40:41,180
No two ways about that.

953
01:40:41,246 --> 01:40:43,831
I'm tired of his prospecting.
I want him out of here.

954
01:40:43,902 --> 01:40:47,612
He's borrowed about all he could.
He's down to his last collar button.

955
01:40:48,636 --> 01:40:49,914
Sure he is.

956
01:40:51,198 --> 01:40:54,777
Buy him out, Ollie.
Buy him out and get him out of here.

957
01:41:55,071 --> 01:41:56,663
Hello, Jett.

958
01:41:56,734 --> 01:41:58,011
What do you want?

959
01:42:08,670 --> 01:42:10,231
My well came in, Bick.

960
01:42:13,727 --> 01:42:14,674
Fine.

961
01:42:17,118 --> 01:42:18,645
That's wonderful, Jett.

962
01:42:20,704 --> 01:42:22,458
Everybody thought I had a duster.

963
01:42:23,229 --> 01:42:27,704
You all thought Spindletop and
Burkburnett was all the oil there was.

964
01:42:28,445 --> 01:42:31,512
I'm here to tell you it ain't, boy. It's here.

965
01:42:32,863 --> 01:42:35,416
There ain't a dang thing
you gonna do about it.

966
01:42:35,678 --> 01:42:37,304
My well came in big, so big.

967
01:42:37,887 --> 01:42:40,156
And there's more down there,
bigger wells.

968
01:42:46,144 --> 01:42:47,353
I'm rich, Bick!

969
01:42:50,335 --> 01:42:53,433
I'm a rich one. I'm a rich boy.

970
01:42:55,038 --> 01:42:58,487
I'm gonna have more money
than you ever thought you could have.

971
01:42:58,591 --> 01:43:01,111
You and the rest of you
stinking sons of Benedicts.

972
01:43:02,654 --> 01:43:05,469
Leslie, go into the house.
Take the women with you.

973
01:43:06,015 --> 01:43:07,925
Jett, we're glad you struck oil.

974
01:43:08,927 --> 01:43:10,455
Now, you go on along home.

975
01:43:12,672 --> 01:43:15,224
My, you sure do look pretty, Miss Leslie.

976
01:43:17,247 --> 01:43:19,003
You always did look pretty.

977
01:43:20,415 --> 01:43:22,041
Pretty, good enough to eat.

978
01:43:26,398 --> 01:43:27,861
Wait a minute.

979
01:43:28,319 --> 01:43:29,814
Take it easy!

980
01:43:33,791 --> 01:43:35,067
You're touchy, Bick.

981
01:43:36,702 --> 01:43:38,362
Touchy as an old cook.

982
01:43:55,999 --> 01:43:58,814
You should have shot him a long time ago.

983
01:43:58,879 --> 01:44:00,570
Now he's too rich to kill.

984
01:44:49,835 --> 01:44:52,552
Tell your client that Reata is my property.

985
01:44:52,650 --> 01:44:54,855
And the name of Reata is my property.

986
01:44:55,146 --> 01:44:57,218
The Texas courts are fair.

987
01:44:57,707 --> 01:45:01,286
He is to cease using the name of my ranch
in his oil schemes.

988
01:45:01,355 --> 01:45:05,097
I won't have oil digging on Reata.
I won't stand for its name being used.

989
01:45:05,162 --> 01:45:06,440
Is that clear?

990
01:45:34,537 --> 01:45:35,486
Mom?

991
01:45:37,993 --> 01:45:39,105
Mother?

992
01:45:54,153 --> 01:45:56,968
They say Aunt Luz was really in love
with Jett Rink herself.

993
01:45:57,033 --> 01:45:59,455
Even if she was old enough
to be his mother.

994
01:45:59,593 --> 01:46:00,641
Now, Luz...

995
01:46:00,714 --> 01:46:02,622
She was a character.

996
01:46:03,049 --> 01:46:05,634
She was always trying to keep him
from getting married.

997
01:46:05,704 --> 01:46:07,592
He had to run off to marry you.

998
01:46:07,912 --> 01:46:08,992
What's that?

999
01:46:09,672 --> 01:46:10,915
Who said what?

1000
01:46:11,496 --> 01:46:12,903
Somebody. I forget.

1001
01:46:17,449 --> 01:46:19,358
You know what they say?

1002
01:46:19,656 --> 01:46:23,268
That every girl in Texas was trying
to catch Papa.

1003
01:46:24,232 --> 01:46:25,475
They said, quote:

1004
01:46:25,544 --> 01:46:28,893
"There wasn't a prize bull like him
since Sam Houston got married".

1005
01:46:29,768 --> 01:46:31,045
That's enough from her.

1006
01:46:32,232 --> 01:46:36,388
I'm sure it's quite true, darling.
It took me two whole days to land him.

1007
01:46:39,047 --> 01:46:42,692
Really? It all sounds so fascinating
and uncouth.

1008
01:47:05,287 --> 01:47:06,432
Where are you going?

1009
01:47:07,686 --> 01:47:10,075
Down the road to Smitty's for Coke.

1010
01:47:10,150 --> 01:47:11,099
With who?

1011
01:47:11,303 --> 01:47:12,230
Nobody.

1012
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:14,464
Stay at home.

1013
01:47:19,046 --> 01:47:19,994
Hey, you!

1014
01:47:24,935 --> 01:47:25,883
Hello, Papa.

1015
01:47:27,334 --> 01:47:28,261
Hi.

1016
01:47:29,094 --> 01:47:30,238
Where have you been?

1017
01:47:30,309 --> 01:47:32,033
Down the road for a Coke.

1018
01:47:32,485 --> 01:47:33,434
With who?

1019
01:47:33,541 --> 01:47:34,490
Bob.

1020
01:47:39,334 --> 01:47:41,701
- Howdy, Mr. Benedict.
- Hello, Bob.

1021
01:47:44,230 --> 01:47:46,269
Well, good night, Mr. Benedict.

1022
01:47:46,597 --> 01:47:48,190
Excuse me, Papa.

1023
01:48:01,028 --> 01:48:03,233
Look, Papa, are you busy now?

1024
01:48:03,717 --> 01:48:05,920
Never too busy for you, young fellow.

1025
01:48:06,788 --> 01:48:08,447
What's on your mind?

1026
01:48:08,901 --> 01:48:10,941
Well, Daddy, it's like this.

1027
01:48:11,525 --> 01:48:13,380
I am, Mama. I'm going to be.

1028
01:48:14,084 --> 01:48:16,987
I want to go to Harvard
and then to Columbia premed.

1029
01:48:18,789 --> 01:48:20,512
So you want to be a doctor?

1030
01:48:21,285 --> 01:48:22,233
Yes.

1031
01:48:25,348 --> 01:48:28,862
How about Reata, Jordy?
He's counting on you to take over.

1032
01:48:30,661 --> 01:48:32,896
Yes, I know he is. I know it.

1033
01:48:34,148 --> 01:48:37,181
But there are 50,000 guys who can do it
better than I can.

1034
01:48:37,827 --> 01:48:40,577
I don't want to live my life
pushing cows around.

1035
01:48:42,979 --> 01:48:45,249
I'd die for Papa if I had to.

1036
01:48:45,924 --> 01:48:49,753
Your father doesn't want you to die
for him. He wants you to live for him.

1037
01:48:50,020 --> 01:48:51,907
Talk to her, will you, Daddy?

1038
01:48:53,091 --> 01:48:54,369
Reason with her.

1039
01:48:56,162 --> 01:48:57,757
I don't want this pinned on me.

1040
01:48:57,827 --> 01:48:59,584
I'll take all the blame.

1041
01:48:59,876 --> 01:49:02,876
You just sort of soften the blow a little bit.

1042
01:49:04,003 --> 01:49:05,596
I'll talk to him myself.

1043
01:49:05,763 --> 01:49:08,130
You can persuade him, Mom.
I know you can.

1044
01:49:08,803 --> 01:49:10,712
It's not gonna be easy, honey.

1045
01:49:13,603 --> 01:49:15,676
Maybe I can catch her at a weak moment.

1046
01:49:15,748 --> 01:49:18,594
You can do it, Daddy. I know you can.

1047
01:49:23,907 --> 01:49:26,012
Darling, I've been thinking...

1048
01:49:27,138 --> 01:49:28,219
Me, too.

1049
01:49:31,522 --> 01:49:33,017
About the children.

1050
01:49:34,339 --> 01:49:36,161
That's funny. Me, too.

1051
01:49:41,346 --> 01:49:42,906
We must be getting old.

1052
01:49:43,586 --> 01:49:44,993
Speak for yourself.

1053
01:49:48,387 --> 01:49:52,477
I wonder if we love them enough
to do what's really right for them.

1054
01:49:53,217 --> 01:49:54,712
Why, sure.

1055
01:49:57,601 --> 01:49:58,747
I hope so.

1056
01:50:00,865 --> 01:50:01,880
I mean...

1057
01:50:03,170 --> 01:50:05,558
so we love them too much perhaps.

1058
01:50:06,498 --> 01:50:10,075
So much that we keep from doing
what's right for them.

1059
01:50:11,393 --> 01:50:12,342
Not me.

1060
01:50:15,169 --> 01:50:17,176
You don't have to worry about me.

1061
01:50:23,297 --> 01:50:24,574
It's always the mother.

1062
01:50:26,784 --> 01:50:30,713
The theory is she doesn't want
her fledglings to leave her nest.

1063
01:50:33,377 --> 01:50:37,205
Try their own wings. All that sort of stuff.

1064
01:50:40,225 --> 01:50:41,402
You mean...

1065
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:45,465
you'd be perfectly willing to sacrifice?

1066
01:50:47,167 --> 01:50:48,116
Yeah.

1067
01:50:50,176 --> 01:50:52,894
I'd sacrifice for her. You know that.

1068
01:51:13,086 --> 01:51:15,836
I'm not so sold on that...

1069
01:51:17,599 --> 01:51:20,501
girl's school in Switzerland
you're stuck on.

1070
01:51:20,702 --> 01:51:22,612
Now, don't get your feathers up.

1071
01:51:23,487 --> 01:51:25,658
Judy's not crazy about that school either.

1072
01:51:25,727 --> 01:51:28,596
Of course she isn't.
That's exactly why she needs to go.

1073
01:51:29,759 --> 01:51:31,318
I wouldn't push her.

1074
01:51:34,623 --> 01:51:35,637
She...

1075
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,868
wants to go to Texas Tech.

1076
01:51:39,006 --> 01:51:40,697
That's a man's school.

1077
01:51:41,278 --> 01:51:42,653
Girls go, too.

1078
01:51:43,486 --> 01:51:46,868
It's got the best animal husbandry course
in the country, she says.

1079
01:51:53,023 --> 01:51:55,640
She wants to be a rancher,
like her old man.

1080
01:51:56,766 --> 01:51:58,174
Like Bob Dace.

1081
01:51:58,942 --> 01:52:03,449
She's just got her little schoolgirl crush
on that hulking Bob Dace.

1082
01:52:04,350 --> 01:52:07,318
She's got her mind set on it.

1083
01:52:08,318 --> 01:52:09,724
That's what she wants.

1084
01:52:10,941 --> 01:52:13,363
And I, for one, am willing to sacrifice.

1085
01:52:40,317 --> 01:52:41,561
What do you say?

1086
01:52:46,556 --> 01:52:49,590
It seems we've hatched
an odd pair of fledglings.

1087
01:52:54,973 --> 01:52:56,248
Brace yourself.

1088
01:52:56,957 --> 01:52:58,930
Jordy wants to be a doctor.

1089
01:53:01,755 --> 01:53:02,705
He wants what?

1090
01:53:02,780 --> 01:53:04,952
He wants to be a doctor.
He's absolutely set on it.

1091
01:53:05,020 --> 01:53:07,574
Over my dead body!
You know what he's supposed to do.

1092
01:53:07,645 --> 01:53:08,723
Well, he's not.

1093
01:53:09,756 --> 01:53:13,814
He'd die for you, but he's not gonna
live his life for you. And he's right.

1094
01:53:14,172 --> 01:53:15,831
He'll do as we've all done.

1095
01:53:17,788 --> 01:53:21,944
He wants to go to Harvard first,
then Columbia premed.

1096
01:53:24,251 --> 01:53:26,456
You're pretty handy with those terms.

1097
01:53:27,739 --> 01:53:30,194
I can see who's been cooking this thing up.

1098
01:53:36,059 --> 01:53:37,139
Of course...

1099
01:53:38,331 --> 01:53:40,981
this would mean a big sacrifice
on your part.

1100
01:53:58,746 --> 01:54:01,298
No matter where he goes to school...

1101
01:54:02,427 --> 01:54:04,980
he comes right back home and runs Reata.

1102
01:54:11,610 --> 01:54:14,065
I guess you were right about one thing.

1103
01:54:16,601 --> 01:54:17,714
Me?

1104
01:54:18,586 --> 01:54:19,732
On one thing.

1105
01:54:22,105 --> 01:54:23,796
We are getting old.

1106
01:54:25,082 --> 01:54:26,030
Who?

1107
01:54:26,426 --> 01:54:27,637
We are, Jordan.

1108
01:54:30,682 --> 01:54:32,568
We are the older generation.

1109
01:54:34,584 --> 01:54:35,665
Aren't we?

1110
01:54:36,696 --> 01:54:37,776
Suddenly?

1111
01:54:45,722 --> 01:54:46,997
I guess so.

1112
01:54:59,992 --> 01:55:02,861
"...unless oil or gas shall have been struck
at a lesser depth".

1113
01:55:02,937 --> 01:55:05,173
Is that about Vashti Hake's ranch?

1114
01:55:07,353 --> 01:55:08,179
Yes.

1115
01:55:10,008 --> 01:55:10,956
Good.

1116
01:55:11,928 --> 01:55:12,976
How about Reata?

1117
01:55:13,783 --> 01:55:16,981
No. That Benedict is a hard guy to crack.

1118
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:26,643
Let's just keep punching, boys.

1119
01:55:59,734 --> 01:56:00,783
Hospital!

1120
01:56:01,207 --> 01:56:02,733
What's he covering up now?

1121
01:56:03,511 --> 01:56:06,544
He'll overstep the mark one of these days.

1122
01:56:06,903 --> 01:56:08,113
Give him enough rope.

1123
01:56:08,951 --> 01:56:11,339
Give him enough rope, and he'll hang you.

1124
01:56:13,206 --> 01:56:14,155
I'll get it.

1125
01:56:18,454 --> 01:56:19,566
Hello.

1126
01:56:22,806 --> 01:56:24,530
No, this is her daughter.

1127
01:56:29,621 --> 01:56:32,010
You'll have to find out for yourself.

1128
01:56:33,014 --> 01:56:35,883
- Take your social life on the other phone.
- It's for you.

1129
01:56:36,118 --> 01:56:37,492
I think he's nice.

1130
01:56:37,558 --> 01:56:39,118
- Who's nice?
- Jett Rink.

1131
01:56:41,813 --> 01:56:43,188
I don't want to talk to him.

1132
01:56:43,253 --> 01:56:44,563
What do I tell him?

1133
01:56:45,174 --> 01:56:47,726
Let me talk. I'll tell him.

1134
01:56:48,277 --> 01:56:49,586
I'll talk to him.

1135
01:56:56,053 --> 01:56:58,420
You've heard from me before on this, Jett.

1136
01:56:58,772 --> 01:57:01,140
Judge Whiteside told you, and I told you.

1137
01:57:01,268 --> 01:57:05,231
This is a cattle ranch, not an oil field.
That's the way it's gonna stay.

1138
01:57:08,021 --> 01:57:10,922
That's about the most expensive
phone call you ever made, Bick.

1139
01:57:10,996 --> 01:57:13,996
It'll cost you a billion dollars a year
for the next 50 years.

1140
01:57:14,069 --> 01:57:18,325
Couldn't we have just one little, itty-bitty
oil well, so I can get a private phone?

1141
01:57:34,836 --> 01:57:39,146
<i>After reporting to President Roosevelt,
the Naval Secretary told the press...</i>

1142
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:43,114
<i>that the battleship Arizona
and five other warships were lost...</i>

1143
01:57:43,187 --> 01:57:47,791
<i>in the Japanese air raid
on Pearl Harbor a fortnight ago.</i>

1144
01:57:48,723 --> 01:57:50,796
<i>He reported that 91 officers...</i>

1145
01:57:51,283 --> 01:57:55,309
<i>and 2,638 enlisted men were known dead.</i>

1146
01:58:01,459 --> 01:58:04,176
That only makes me realize I'm losing you.

1147
01:59:25,425 --> 01:59:26,854
Here they are.

1148
01:59:29,712 --> 01:59:31,468
When did you two sneak in?

1149
01:59:31,664 --> 01:59:33,257
The honeymooners!

1150
01:59:39,120 --> 01:59:41,968
Judy, you're gonna get it.
You know Mom wanted a big wedding.

1151
01:59:42,064 --> 01:59:43,820
That's not true, Luz.

1152
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:47,428
Not quite true.

1153
02:00:21,070 --> 02:00:23,046
We came for you to see Ángel.

1154
02:00:24,238 --> 02:00:26,627
He's the first soldier from Reata.

1155
02:00:26,959 --> 02:00:29,676
- Merry Christmas, Polo.
- Merry Christmas.

1156
02:00:34,190 --> 02:00:36,426
Isn't he a fine-looking soldier?

1157
02:00:37,935 --> 02:00:39,363
Just a minute.

1158
02:00:44,110 --> 02:00:45,997
Merry Christmas, Ángel.

1159
02:00:46,062 --> 02:00:47,076
Thank you.

1160
02:00:47,245 --> 02:00:50,923
Today the wish of all of us is
that the war ends quickly...

1161
02:00:51,662 --> 02:00:54,858
and that you, Ángel,
return safely to Reata...

1162
02:00:56,366 --> 02:00:59,235
and to all of those
who love you very much.

1163
02:00:59,598 --> 02:01:01,670
I'll drink a toast to that.

1164
02:01:03,757 --> 02:01:05,667
Come on, now, and open it.

1165
02:01:32,269 --> 02:01:34,821
- Hello, Dr. Guerra.
- Hello, Dr. Benedict.

1166
02:01:35,436 --> 02:01:37,324
Just a little premature.

1167
02:01:37,389 --> 02:01:38,665
I know, it takes time.

1168
02:01:39,373 --> 02:01:41,161
Jordan, this is Juana.

1169
02:01:42,477 --> 02:01:45,029
She's been training out at the hospital.

1170
02:01:48,045 --> 02:01:50,597
It must be that darn north wind static.

1171
02:01:52,397 --> 02:01:57,098
Don't tell me you haven't learned that
dry wind, friction, and a heavy carpet...

1172
02:01:57,516 --> 02:02:01,061
are not the only means of creating
electricity between human beings.

1173
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:16,514
Thank you.

1174
02:02:21,899 --> 02:02:24,867
Could you stay and give me the lowdown
on what it's like?

1175
02:02:32,650 --> 02:02:34,952
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.

1176
02:02:35,403 --> 02:02:37,159
- Goodbye.
- "Adiós".

1177
02:02:39,562 --> 02:02:42,977
- Let's get some Christmas cheer.
- You talked me into it!

1178
02:02:50,955 --> 02:02:54,304
Friends, we're gonna have
a mighty triumphant Christmas.

1179
02:02:56,393 --> 02:02:59,426
I'm gonna drink a toast
to two young men of Reata.

1180
02:03:01,289 --> 02:03:02,370
My two sons.

1181
02:03:10,762 --> 02:03:12,550
Thank you, Mr. Benedict.

1182
02:03:17,578 --> 02:03:20,131
Better take it easy on the bourbon, Dad.

1183
02:03:21,033 --> 02:03:22,526
It's not good for you.

1184
02:03:23,625 --> 02:03:25,054
I'm not kidding you.

1185
02:03:30,730 --> 02:03:32,639
I hate to see Ángel go.

1186
02:03:33,098 --> 02:03:36,294
That boy is the best dang man
on the place.

1187
02:03:41,545 --> 02:03:46,084
It's time for you to take your place here,
to produce beef for the war.

1188
02:03:47,017 --> 02:03:50,212
They need doctors, Dad.
They need doctors in war, too.

1189
02:03:51,945 --> 02:03:54,334
I want to finish medical school if I can.

1190
02:03:55,209 --> 02:03:56,834
You are being bull-headed.

1191
02:03:58,344 --> 02:04:01,061
I never would be any good
at running this place.

1192
02:04:02,888 --> 02:04:04,961
Any man on Reata can do it better.

1193
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:06,720
You're the one.

1194
02:04:08,072 --> 02:04:10,461
You're the one with a responsibility
to Reata.

1195
02:04:10,536 --> 02:04:13,471
Your blood pressure is going up
just while we're talking here.

1196
02:04:14,824 --> 02:04:17,246
Please, it isn't good for you. Just relax.

1197
02:04:17,319 --> 02:04:19,229
Don't you get fresh with me.

1198
02:04:25,703 --> 02:04:27,132
We're talking.

1199
02:04:27,464 --> 02:04:28,892
Yes, I heard.

1200
02:04:29,863 --> 02:04:34,173
It's Christmas morning. Isn't this
something you could discuss tomorrow?

1201
02:04:35,688 --> 02:04:37,596
There's nothing to discuss.

1202
02:04:37,895 --> 02:04:41,244
When I come home,
I'll work with Dr. Guerra in Vientecito.

1203
02:04:44,039 --> 02:04:47,236
I love Texas as much as you do.
I want to work here.

1204
02:04:48,136 --> 02:04:51,102
I just want to work in a different way,
that's all.

1205
02:04:52,679 --> 02:04:53,889
Come on, Jordan.

1206
02:04:55,816 --> 02:04:57,277
Work with Guerra!

1207
02:05:09,127 --> 02:05:10,784
Here's to you, Mr. Benedict.

1208
02:05:15,493 --> 02:05:17,469
You look beat, Mr. Benedict.

1209
02:05:17,541 --> 02:05:18,523
Here's to you.

1210
02:05:18,598 --> 02:05:20,289
It's pretty good stuff.

1211
02:05:20,965 --> 02:05:22,722
Did you make that yourself?

1212
02:05:24,359 --> 02:05:26,267
Yes, I make it every year.

1213
02:05:27,814 --> 02:05:29,723
It's my Christmas special.

1214
02:05:30,214 --> 02:05:32,003
No, I mean the liquor.

1215
02:05:32,326 --> 02:05:34,234
Did you make the liquor yourself?

1216
02:05:34,662 --> 02:05:38,458
If not, it's about the only thing
you don't produce on Reata yourself.

1217
02:05:43,046 --> 02:05:44,638
Come here and sit down.

1218
02:05:45,285 --> 02:05:47,194
I've got some serious talk
to make with you.

1219
02:05:54,373 --> 02:05:57,721
I've been watching you pretty close
for a lot of years.

1220
02:06:02,276 --> 02:06:03,869
You're a ranchman.

1221
02:06:05,572 --> 02:06:07,133
And you're smart.

1222
02:06:16,036 --> 02:06:18,524
You're wondering why I'm talking to you.

1223
02:06:25,987 --> 02:06:27,198
Bob Dace...

1224
02:06:28,324 --> 02:06:29,754
look me right in the eye.

1225
02:06:33,476 --> 02:06:37,916
You could never be anything but a rancher,
could you?

1226
02:06:38,243 --> 02:06:39,837
- No, sir.
- That's my boy.

1227
02:06:39,971 --> 02:06:42,339
But somebody else thinks I could.

1228
02:06:44,227 --> 02:06:45,176
Not my Judy.

1229
02:06:45,251 --> 02:06:46,812
- No, sir, it's not Judy.
- Who?

1230
02:06:47,907 --> 02:06:49,566
President Roosevelt.

1231
02:06:52,483 --> 02:06:53,911
Listen to this:

1232
02:06:58,242 --> 02:07:00,315
"To Robert Haskell Dace.

1233
02:07:01,251 --> 02:07:05,180
"Greetings from the President
of the United States".

1234
02:07:05,379 --> 02:07:06,655
Let me see that.

1235
02:07:09,251 --> 02:07:13,212
"You are hereby notified to report
on December 28...

1236
02:07:13,506 --> 02:07:15,449
"5:00 a.m. For induction".

1237
02:07:21,154 --> 02:07:22,583
It don't matter.

1238
02:07:24,003 --> 02:07:26,392
Your job won't let you leave this place.

1239
02:07:26,690 --> 02:07:30,137
It'll make you stay right here.
This is just as important as carrying a gun.

1240
02:07:30,210 --> 02:07:32,414
I appreciate your confidence, sir.

1241
02:07:33,281 --> 02:07:36,598
But this is one thing
I'm not gonna try to get out of.

1242
02:07:40,162 --> 02:07:42,333
Have it your way. You might as well...

1243
02:07:43,073 --> 02:07:45,277
everybody else does around here.

1244
02:07:47,585 --> 02:07:50,901
I'll show you my heart's in the right place.

1245
02:07:51,745 --> 02:07:54,560
When you come back
after the war is over...

1246
02:07:55,361 --> 02:07:56,767
the job's yours.

1247
02:07:56,930 --> 02:07:58,838
It'll be waiting for you.

1248
02:08:00,673 --> 02:08:02,200
I couldn't take it, sir.

1249
02:08:02,305 --> 02:08:04,344
Papa, Bob and I have plans.

1250
02:08:06,433 --> 02:08:08,670
We want a place, just our own.

1251
02:08:11,584 --> 02:08:13,341
You crazy kids, you!

1252
02:08:15,552 --> 02:08:18,847
Can you imagine you'll ever have
anything like this? Like Reata?

1253
02:08:18,912 --> 02:08:21,662
Gosh, no, sir. We just want a little place.

1254
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:26,103
Just a little place that'll allow us time
for experimentation and progress.

1255
02:08:26,208 --> 02:08:29,273
See, sir, big stuff is old stuff now.

1256
02:08:29,664 --> 02:08:31,574
Big stuff is old stuff?

1257
02:08:31,680 --> 02:08:35,957
Bob didn't mean to upset you.
He just wants to be honest, that's all.

1258
02:08:36,992 --> 02:08:40,669
We just want something little
that's our own. That's all.

1259
02:08:41,632 --> 02:08:43,038
Just ours.

1260
02:08:43,872 --> 02:08:45,301
You see, Dad?

1261
02:08:46,815 --> 02:08:48,888
Yeah, honey, I see.

1262
02:08:52,095 --> 02:08:53,524
See you, Daddy.

1263
02:09:05,151 --> 02:09:07,770
Keeping it together all my life for them!

1264
02:09:08,479 --> 02:09:11,512
I battled mesquite, dust, and the wind...

1265
02:09:12,255 --> 02:09:13,781
to keep it this big.

1266
02:09:14,752 --> 02:09:16,060
And for who?

1267
02:09:17,055 --> 02:09:20,252
I might just as well give it back
to the dirty Comanches!

1268
02:09:20,575 --> 02:09:22,003
That's the Christmas spirit.

1269
02:09:22,079 --> 02:09:24,446
Give it all back to the poor old Indians.

1270
02:09:29,854 --> 02:09:32,790
Don't tell me, I know. You're Jett Rink.

1271
02:09:35,998 --> 02:09:37,207
You're Judy.

1272
02:09:37,278 --> 02:09:38,555
No, I'm Luz.

1273
02:09:42,718 --> 02:09:43,798
That I am.

1274
02:09:43,902 --> 02:09:45,179
Come on in.

1275
02:09:52,061 --> 02:09:53,971
Dad's over at the bar.

1276
02:09:55,485 --> 02:09:58,201
Feel free, it's Christmas.
Everybody gets one.

1277
02:10:00,541 --> 02:10:01,817
Christmas?

1278
02:10:02,973 --> 02:10:06,618
I thought that was next week.
Somebody ought to have told me.

1279
02:10:08,445 --> 02:10:11,293
Christmas greetings
from Mr. Jetexas himself.

1280
02:10:24,478 --> 02:10:25,524
Sit down.

1281
02:10:31,004 --> 02:10:34,517
I guess Christmas is as good a day as any
to talk business.

1282
02:10:37,533 --> 02:10:38,743
Run along, Luz.

1283
02:10:39,837 --> 02:10:41,909
We've got business to talk about.

1284
02:10:42,011 --> 02:10:43,092
'Bye, now.

1285
02:10:45,340 --> 02:10:46,769
'Bye, Mr. Rink.

1286
02:10:48,540 --> 02:10:50,776
Everybody calls me Jett, honey.

1287
02:10:57,467 --> 02:10:58,613
Bye-bye.

1288
02:11:07,291 --> 02:11:08,785
What's on your mind?

1289
02:11:08,860 --> 02:11:10,932
The country needs petroleum.

1290
02:11:11,739 --> 02:11:13,878
I'm going to Washington, Bick.

1291
02:11:14,396 --> 02:11:17,297
The reason I'm going
and the reason I'm here is oil.

1292
02:11:19,450 --> 02:11:20,727
I figured.

1293
02:11:22,235 --> 02:11:24,144
You want to talk a little business?

1294
02:11:24,763 --> 02:11:26,038
I'm ready.

1295
02:11:27,163 --> 02:11:30,359
It seems that every time we made a deal,
me and you...

1296
02:11:33,753 --> 02:11:36,055
it just turned out pretty lucky...

1297
02:11:37,306 --> 02:11:38,582
for somebody.

1298
02:12:12,826 --> 02:12:16,437
All this oil around here hasn't made
a lot of difference.

1299
02:12:17,433 --> 02:12:20,302
We live pretty much like we always have
here in Reata.

1300
02:12:21,369 --> 02:12:23,279
Just like we Benedicts found it.

1301
02:12:25,144 --> 02:12:29,138
The Lord was good to you, to set
the swimming pool in your own front yard.

1302
02:12:32,281 --> 02:12:33,874
Hey, come on in.

1303
02:12:34,745 --> 02:12:36,174
Not now, Luz.

1304
02:12:41,208 --> 02:12:43,477
It's good for the young folks.

1305
02:12:44,569 --> 02:12:47,438
We'd have made improvements
around here, oil or no oil.

1306
02:12:48,184 --> 02:12:51,861
But that 27.5 percent tax exemption
on oil helped, didn't it?

1307
02:12:54,169 --> 02:12:56,590
Bale, I'll tell you what old Pinky thinks.

1308
02:12:56,696 --> 02:12:57,394
What?

1309
02:12:57,465 --> 02:13:01,742
That oil tax exemption is the best thing
to hit Texas since we whooped Geronimo.

1310
02:13:09,847 --> 02:13:12,881
One of the finest laws ever passed
in Washington.

1311
02:13:13,847 --> 02:13:16,116
And all joking aside, Bick...

1312
02:13:16,503 --> 02:13:19,471
we're not adverse to accepting
a share of the credit for it.

1313
02:13:19,543 --> 02:13:20,788
Not at all.

1314
02:13:21,304 --> 02:13:25,460
How about an exemption for depreciation
of first-class brains, Senator?

1315
02:13:25,687 --> 02:13:27,116
Whose? Yours?

1316
02:13:27,639 --> 02:13:31,949
My father's, for instance. He spent his life
saving other people's lives.

1317
02:13:32,886 --> 02:13:35,275
How about some tax exemption there?

1318
02:13:40,470 --> 02:13:43,787
Leslie has always been a real sharp talker,
ain't she?

1319
02:13:44,214 --> 02:13:47,891
Fair enough, Judge. You've always been
smooth enough for two.

1320
02:13:49,527 --> 02:13:52,787
"Do you take each other
for better or for worse...

1321
02:13:53,910 --> 02:13:55,982
"for richer or for poorer...

1322
02:13:56,790 --> 02:13:59,659
"in sickness and in health, until death?

1323
02:14:03,574 --> 02:14:06,803
"Jordan Benedict, wilt thou take...

1324
02:14:07,414 --> 02:14:09,356
"Juana Villalobos here present...

1325
02:14:10,230 --> 02:14:14,637
"for your lawful wife, according to
the rite of our Holy Mother the Church?"

1326
02:14:16,054 --> 02:14:17,003
I will.

1327
02:14:18,230 --> 02:14:21,229
"Juana Villalobos, wilt thou take...

1328
02:14:22,198 --> 02:14:24,369
"Jordan Benedict here present...

1329
02:14:24,469 --> 02:14:29,008
"for your lawful husband, according to
the rite of our Holy Mother the Church?"

1330
02:14:30,837 --> 02:14:31,785
I will.

1331
02:14:32,821 --> 02:14:35,025
Join your hands and kneel down.

1332
02:16:35,857 --> 02:16:37,450
What did they say?

1333
02:16:43,025 --> 02:16:44,651
<i>Friends and neighbors...</i>

1334
02:16:45,937 --> 02:16:47,847
<i>I want you all to meet my wife.</i>

1335
02:16:49,522 --> 02:16:51,114
<i>Mrs. Jordan Benedict III.</i>

1336
02:16:52,881 --> 02:16:53,961
Congratulations!

1337
02:18:08,558 --> 02:18:11,275
He was the first Reata baby I ever saw.

1338
02:18:12,975 --> 02:18:15,396
I remember it as if it were yesterday.

1339
02:18:17,839 --> 02:18:19,267
He had a fever.

1340
02:18:21,038 --> 02:18:24,071
I didn't think he was going
to live the day out.

1341
02:19:24,877 --> 02:19:29,665
On behalf of the U.S. Army, I am proud
to present to you the flag of our nation...

1342
02:19:30,156 --> 02:19:32,873
which your son defended so gallantly.

1343
02:21:44,391 --> 02:21:46,779
Everyone in the world's gonna be there.

1344
02:21:47,815 --> 02:21:50,685
I'm gonna fly up to Dallas,
and I'm going to Neiman's.

1345
02:21:51,047 --> 02:21:54,692
I'll buy myself
a starlight-white evening dress.

1346
02:21:55,271 --> 02:21:58,140
Very plain and simple and deadly.

1347
02:21:59,335 --> 02:22:01,375
Before you get so elaborate and simple...

1348
02:22:01,447 --> 02:22:03,814
you'd better hear
what your father has to say.

1349
02:22:03,910 --> 02:22:06,146
We're certainly going. I promised Jett.

1350
02:22:07,333 --> 02:22:10,269
Jett! What are you talking about?

1351
02:22:10,855 --> 02:22:15,261
He likes me. He likes my family, too.
He's always talking about you.

1352
02:22:17,126 --> 02:22:19,035
My dear, darling Luz...

1353
02:22:19,494 --> 02:22:23,389
if I didn't know you had a level Benedict
head on those immature shoulders...

1354
02:22:23,462 --> 02:22:25,566
I'd prescribe a good spanking.

1355
02:22:25,862 --> 02:22:28,797
He's dreamy. Ask the Snythe girls.

1356
02:22:29,094 --> 02:22:30,272
Ask anyone.

1357
02:22:30,405 --> 02:22:32,315
He's just a rough diamond.

1358
02:22:32,422 --> 02:22:36,513
He's a rough rhinestone.
He's old enough to be your father.

1359
02:22:38,149 --> 02:22:40,221
What are you six evil men up to now?

1360
02:22:40,294 --> 02:22:42,749
Honey, it's a coronation.

1361
02:22:43,365 --> 02:22:45,569
Jett plans to get himself crowned king.

1362
02:22:45,637 --> 02:22:48,026
You got to have $10 million
to be on the guest list.

1363
02:22:48,100 --> 02:22:50,784
The most important people
in the country will be there.

1364
02:22:50,852 --> 02:22:52,512
Coast-to-coast broadcast.

1365
02:22:52,581 --> 02:22:54,654
Jett's gonna make a magnificent speech.

1366
02:22:54,725 --> 02:22:55,673
I know.

1367
02:22:56,612 --> 02:22:58,523
I'm going to write it for him.

1368
02:22:58,597 --> 02:23:00,736
It'll be heard across the nation
by everyone.

1369
02:23:00,805 --> 02:23:03,673
Eliminating one. That's me.

1370
02:23:05,413 --> 02:23:09,723
If you people stay away, Leslie, you'll be
the only folks in Texas who ain't there.

1371
02:23:09,797 --> 02:23:11,706
You'll be roped in with the herd.

1372
02:23:11,780 --> 02:23:15,905
You'll be putting on your pink shoes and
dancing to Jett's fiddles like the rest of us.

1373
02:23:15,973 --> 02:23:18,176
If we go then we'll do it right.

1374
02:23:18,244 --> 02:23:22,882
We're oil rich, like the rest of them.
We'll go like the rest of them! Only better.

1375
02:23:22,949 --> 02:23:24,671
Now you're talking like my father.

1376
02:23:24,740 --> 02:23:26,300
The old Benedict spirit.

1377
02:23:26,372 --> 02:23:28,511
You set up one of your great weekends.

1378
02:23:28,579 --> 02:23:30,751
Invite everybody.
We'll take them all with us.

1379
02:23:30,821 --> 02:23:34,016
We'll show that so-and-so
who's top people around here.

1380
02:23:34,276 --> 02:23:36,349
I'll even buy the four-engine Douglas.

1381
02:23:36,644 --> 02:23:38,880
Fly in some orchids from Hawaii.

1382
02:23:40,451 --> 02:23:43,899
We'll fly in low and shake the tiles
off that hotel roof.

1383
02:24:42,370 --> 02:24:43,930
There's Lola Lane!

1384
02:24:44,001 --> 02:24:46,237
I bet even Hollywood isn't this exciting.

1385
02:24:46,306 --> 02:24:48,728
- Isn't this something?
- It's perfectly fabulous!

1386
02:24:48,801 --> 02:24:51,190
Jett always tries to do things
in a bigger way...

1387
02:24:51,266 --> 02:24:53,306
and spend more money than anybody else.

1388
02:24:53,378 --> 02:24:54,839
Really? What does he do?

1389
02:24:55,297 --> 02:24:58,046
To some folks, he's just
a no-good wildcatting so-and-so.

1390
02:25:16,352 --> 02:25:17,301
There he is.

1391
02:25:23,967 --> 02:25:25,877
There's the emperor himself.

1392
02:25:33,409 --> 02:25:36,724
Isn't this terrific?
Look at Luz, she's queen of the parade.

1393
02:25:37,312 --> 02:25:38,970
You didn't tell me.

1394
02:25:43,232 --> 02:25:45,141
Did you know about this, Leslie?

1395
02:25:46,975 --> 02:25:47,924
No, I didn't.

1396
02:25:54,208 --> 02:25:57,556
My daughter, queen of Jett Rink Day!
What is this?

1397
02:25:59,008 --> 02:26:00,601
I don't know, Jordan.

1398
02:26:01,951 --> 02:26:04,886
She's done things before I haven't
gone along with, but this...

1399
02:26:04,959 --> 02:26:06,781
She's never been sneaky.

1400
02:26:06,943 --> 02:26:09,977
It's not exactly sneaky,
appearing in a parade.

1401
02:26:10,079 --> 02:26:11,574
Don't try to be funny.

1402
02:26:11,966 --> 02:26:14,552
I'm not. I'm just as upset as you are.

1403
02:26:15,551 --> 02:26:19,228
But Luz is intelligent enough
not to be imposed on by him or anyone.

1404
02:26:19,455 --> 02:26:20,731
Give me the desk.

1405
02:26:21,695 --> 02:26:22,807
It's Bick Benedict.

1406
02:26:22,878 --> 02:26:25,267
Did my daughter
Luz Benedict come in yet?

1407
02:26:25,950 --> 02:26:28,733
Get this. As soon as she comes in,
have her call me.

1408
02:27:05,566 --> 02:27:07,638
You know what I think I'll do?

1409
02:27:09,981 --> 02:27:12,370
I'm going to keep it just like this.

1410
02:27:14,845 --> 02:27:17,528
I'll keep all those people, send them home.

1411
02:27:20,414 --> 02:27:22,300
I'm not even gonna open up this place.

1412
02:27:25,469 --> 02:27:28,503
Some girls might like a hotel
all to themselves.

1413
02:27:29,532 --> 02:27:32,379
Me, I like company, Jett.
I like lots of people.

1414
02:27:35,004 --> 02:27:36,150
All right.

1415
02:27:37,436 --> 02:27:40,982
You want lots of people?
I don't see any problem there.

1416
02:27:45,564 --> 02:27:49,688
If there's anything you want,
just say it, and you've got it.

1417
02:27:53,308 --> 02:27:55,413
All right, I'd like a Coke.

1418
02:27:59,325 --> 02:28:02,259
No, that's impossible.
That's just impossible.

1419
02:28:03,131 --> 02:28:06,808
You know as well as I do, Cokes are taboo.
All soft drinks.

1420
02:28:09,564 --> 02:28:11,090
You make the rules.

1421
02:28:16,283 --> 02:28:18,836
You like things your own way, don't you?

1422
02:28:19,835 --> 02:28:21,745
Let me ask you something.

1423
02:28:22,811 --> 02:28:27,120
Do you like things your way?
Not many people have things their way.

1424
02:28:28,347 --> 02:28:30,900
No, I don't get them my way very often.

1425
02:28:34,939 --> 02:28:37,807
And you won't either,
until you get married...

1426
02:28:40,347 --> 02:28:43,096
and get your man
to give you what you want.

1427
02:28:43,163 --> 02:28:44,111
So?

1428
02:28:45,433 --> 02:28:48,631
So if I was you,
I'd start thinking about getting married.

1429
02:28:49,914 --> 02:28:51,703
You know, that's an idea.

1430
02:28:58,843 --> 02:29:01,559
You looked like a queen
in that parade today.

1431
02:29:02,618 --> 02:29:04,080
That was my job.

1432
02:29:14,521 --> 02:29:16,277
It's just what you are.

1433
02:29:16,954 --> 02:29:18,840
Luz Benedict II.

1434
02:29:21,305 --> 02:29:25,102
You could be the head lady
of this part of the whole country...

1435
02:29:26,200 --> 02:29:29,267
if you wanted to.
If you married the right man.

1436
02:29:30,745 --> 02:29:32,173
That's a sweet idea.

1437
02:29:34,520 --> 02:29:37,073
Why don't I just announce it tonight...

1438
02:29:37,337 --> 02:29:40,371
with all them thousands
of people listening?

1439
02:29:42,777 --> 02:29:44,184
The whole of Texas.

1440
02:29:46,456 --> 02:29:48,693
Wouldn't that blow the roof off?

1441
02:29:53,272 --> 02:29:55,181
Jett, tell me something.

1442
02:29:59,352 --> 02:30:00,814
Is this a proposal?

1443
02:30:00,888 --> 02:30:02,482
Does it sound like one?

1444
02:30:05,240 --> 02:30:07,476
After a fashion, but not quite.

1445
02:30:11,384 --> 02:30:14,253
You want me to say something
you can laugh at?

1446
02:30:16,600 --> 02:30:17,548
No.

1447
02:30:20,631 --> 02:30:23,185
I just think you're a wonderful girl.

1448
02:30:24,599 --> 02:30:26,966
And I do think you're beautiful.

1449
02:30:30,710 --> 02:30:34,606
You're fascinating to me.
I've always been looking for...

1450
02:30:35,415 --> 02:30:36,822
a girl like you.

1451
02:30:48,471 --> 02:30:51,188
Sure would blow the roof off, wouldn't it?

1452
02:30:55,318 --> 02:30:57,554
You've got a long way to go tonight.

1453
02:31:02,871 --> 02:31:05,423
I'm very flattered. Any girl would be.

1454
02:31:11,223 --> 02:31:12,978
You be a good boy now.

1455
02:31:14,582 --> 02:31:15,956
I'll see you later.

1456
02:32:17,909 --> 02:32:20,756
I hope this storm doesn't louse up
your party.

1457
02:32:20,820 --> 02:32:24,617
A slip-up, boy. I just forgot
to order the right kind of weather!

1458
02:32:25,107 --> 02:32:26,450
I heard a twister hit Waco.

1459
02:32:44,052 --> 02:32:46,604
What's wrong with you?
Can't you talk United States?

1460
02:32:46,707 --> 02:32:48,136
You're talking to my wife.

1461
02:32:48,787 --> 02:32:51,984
I'm Jordan Benedict,
if that means anything to you.

1462
02:32:52,372 --> 02:32:54,259
I'm just following orders.

1463
02:32:54,579 --> 02:32:57,677
Mr. Rink said he'd have my neck
if I let any of the wrong people in.

1464
02:33:05,618 --> 02:33:08,847
You Benedicts are all close together.
They've got the Coronado suite.

1465
02:33:08,914 --> 02:33:10,343
You're in the Filando suite.

1466
02:33:10,418 --> 02:33:13,101
I'm a mess. I must go to the beauty parlor.

1467
02:33:13,170 --> 02:33:15,081
Hurry before they close.

1468
02:33:15,379 --> 02:33:19,371
<i>Grand opening of the Jett Rink Airport
and Emperador Hotel...</i>

1469
02:33:19,826 --> 02:33:23,819
<i>is the latest milestone in the dramatic
life of this virile son of Texas.</i>

1470
02:33:26,450 --> 02:33:27,529
Howdy, everybody!

1471
02:33:31,090 --> 02:33:33,228
- It's time you got here.
- Where are the boys?

1472
02:33:33,298 --> 02:33:34,824
Where's Pinky, the old bat?

1473
02:33:35,729 --> 02:33:37,639
Filando suite for Mr. Benedict, please.

1474
02:33:38,546 --> 02:33:39,790
<i>Beauty salon.</i>

1475
02:33:39,858 --> 02:33:41,134
Can you take me?

1476
02:33:42,226 --> 02:33:44,113
<i>Yes, if you can come right along.</i>

1477
02:33:44,177 --> 02:33:46,185
Thank goodness. I'll be right in.

1478
02:33:46,258 --> 02:33:48,429
<i>- Who's calling, please?
- Mrs. Benedict.</i>

1479
02:33:48,785 --> 02:33:50,695
<i>Come on along, Mrs. Benedict.</i>

1480
02:33:50,769 --> 02:33:51,784
Thank you.

1481
02:33:54,129 --> 02:33:56,649
Keep everybody freshened up, will you?
We'll be quick.

1482
02:33:56,721 --> 02:34:00,037
We're anxious to see old Jett come out
in that suit.

1483
02:34:03,024 --> 02:34:06,407
Why couldn't they ride with us
like other people's kids do?

1484
02:34:06,481 --> 02:34:09,994
Luz had to fly her own plane
and Jordy and Juana had to drive.

1485
02:34:32,592 --> 02:34:34,021
Is anybody here?

1486
02:34:38,256 --> 02:34:39,782
We're all booked up.

1487
02:34:39,855 --> 02:34:42,244
I just called. I'm Mrs. Benedict.

1488
02:34:43,983 --> 02:34:45,893
I'm sorry, but we're busy.

1489
02:34:47,023 --> 02:34:48,779
I'll wait a little.

1490
02:34:56,240 --> 02:34:58,989
They're driving. It takes time.

1491
02:34:59,119 --> 02:35:01,007
I know it takes time.

1492
02:35:01,935 --> 02:35:03,942
I made the trip myself 400 times.

1493
02:35:07,022 --> 02:35:09,095
But don't worry about the children.

1494
02:35:09,199 --> 02:35:12,068
Their behavior is odd,
but their manners are beautiful.

1495
02:35:12,142 --> 02:35:13,571
Listen here, boy!

1496
02:35:13,679 --> 02:35:15,533
I've taken enough from you!

1497
02:35:15,695 --> 02:35:17,517
I didn't want to come here!

1498
02:35:17,582 --> 02:35:20,396
I wouldn't be here unless you let them
bully you into it.

1499
02:35:20,462 --> 02:35:22,850
Now, for heaven's sake,
let's make the best of it.

1500
02:35:22,927 --> 02:35:27,018
Cool down, go on with your shaving, finish
dressing, and I'll go downstairs with you!

1501
02:35:27,118 --> 02:35:29,093
Otherwise, you can go alone!

1502
02:35:30,542 --> 02:35:31,819
You know, honey...

1503
02:35:33,134 --> 02:35:35,469
you're awful cute when you get riled.

1504
02:35:43,118 --> 02:35:46,631
Hurry on in there.
Your ma and pa are sure having a battle.

1505
02:35:50,670 --> 02:35:51,684
Hello, honey.

1506
02:35:51,757 --> 02:35:53,035
Where have you been?

1507
02:35:53,134 --> 02:35:54,889
We got tied up in traffic.

1508
02:35:54,958 --> 02:35:56,005
Where's Juana?

1509
02:35:56,078 --> 02:35:58,314
She's in the beauty parlor.

1510
02:35:59,597 --> 02:36:01,702
Hello, sweetheart.

1511
02:36:02,668 --> 02:36:04,906
He's all right. He just didn't get his nap.

1512
02:36:06,573 --> 02:36:08,515
How's my child?

1513
02:36:09,581 --> 02:36:11,555
Is that Judy crying?

1514
02:36:31,341 --> 02:36:32,682
I hope I'm not too late.

1515
02:36:32,748 --> 02:36:34,178
No. Come right in.

1516
02:36:56,843 --> 02:36:57,825
Yeah?

1517
02:36:58,316 --> 02:36:59,591
Hello, Juana.

1518
02:36:59,851 --> 02:37:02,241
Yeah, he's here. Jordy, it's for you.

1519
02:37:07,435 --> 02:37:08,580
Yes, dear?

1520
02:37:12,715 --> 02:37:15,432
Stay right there, honey.
I'm coming right down.

1521
02:37:19,722 --> 02:37:22,439
Don't you folks wait on us, we'll catch up.

1522
02:37:23,787 --> 02:37:25,314
Son, you're way behind.

1523
02:37:28,299 --> 02:37:30,687
Howdy, everybody, look what we found.

1524
02:37:37,194 --> 02:37:38,471
There you are.

1525
02:37:39,626 --> 02:37:41,252
We were getting worried.

1526
02:37:42,027 --> 02:37:44,066
You'd better get dressed, Jett.

1527
02:37:46,218 --> 02:37:49,088
You wanted me to go over
the speech with you, too.

1528
02:37:49,770 --> 02:37:51,526
Come on, we'd better hurry.

1529
02:37:53,898 --> 02:37:57,247
I'm sorry, but it happens to be
Mr. Jett Rink's orders, himself.

1530
02:37:57,642 --> 02:37:59,072
I'm just working here.

1531
02:37:59,370 --> 02:38:01,759
Everybody's orders. Same all over town.

1532
02:38:02,058 --> 02:38:05,735
The young lady should have gone
to a place where they do her people.

1533
02:38:18,697 --> 02:38:20,934
If it isn't the queen herself!

1534
02:38:21,512 --> 02:38:23,236
- Are you having fun?
- We're making out.

1535
02:38:23,305 --> 02:38:25,215
- How are you doing?
- Good.

1536
02:38:25,769 --> 02:38:27,525
Where are Mom and Dad?

1537
02:38:27,817 --> 02:38:29,409
Don't trifle with your luck.

1538
02:38:31,113 --> 02:38:32,225
There you are.

1539
02:38:32,810 --> 02:38:34,881
You wanted to talk to me, Dad?

1540
02:38:35,465 --> 02:38:38,694
If you can spare me a moment,
I'd like to talk to you, young lady.

1541
02:38:38,761 --> 02:38:40,037
Dad, must we now?

1542
02:38:40,232 --> 02:38:43,267
Jordan, we must hurry to be in time
for the grand entrance.

1543
02:38:43,336 --> 02:38:45,890
Luz, darling, you look just beautiful!

1544
02:38:46,889 --> 02:38:49,922
Help me round everybody up.
I'm sorry I'm so late.

1545
02:38:50,280 --> 02:38:52,037
All right, people...

1546
02:39:30,247 --> 02:39:32,352
Did some of you boys change this around?

1547
02:39:33,606 --> 02:39:37,283
We haven't changed a single comma.
Changes tend to throw you.

1548
02:39:38,247 --> 02:39:42,402
"Columbus discovered only the shell
of this country. Agassiz came..."

1549
02:39:49,286 --> 02:39:50,628
Where's Rink?

1550
02:39:50,822 --> 02:39:52,414
He went thataway.

1551
02:40:06,822 --> 02:40:09,375
Looks like I just come in for a root beer.

1552
02:40:09,829 --> 02:40:12,699
That, my friend, is a Texas range.

1553
02:40:29,510 --> 02:40:31,298
What're you doing sitting up there?

1554
02:40:31,365 --> 02:40:35,674
"You've heard of Paul Revere?"
The Texan said, "Paul Revere?

1555
02:40:36,357 --> 02:40:39,553
"Oh, yes. Ain't he the fellow
that had to ride for help?"

1556
02:40:45,892 --> 02:40:49,154
<i>In just a few moments, Mr. Rink himself...</i>

1557
02:40:49,635 --> 02:40:52,025
<i>will be here at the microphone.</i>

1558
02:40:52,100 --> 02:40:53,694
Come on, let's go.

1559
02:41:01,251 --> 02:41:03,489
Jordy is looking for Jett Rink.

1560
02:41:03,749 --> 02:41:04,860
What?

1561
02:41:12,868 --> 02:41:17,124
Where we had our hair done. Jordy wants
to fight Jett because it was his orders.

1562
02:41:17,188 --> 02:41:20,188
On account of Juana. The girl said
they didn't take wetbacks.

1563
02:42:04,257 --> 02:42:06,297
Stay here, honey, I'll be right back.

1564
02:42:17,795 --> 02:42:19,933
You invited me here to insult my wife.

1565
02:42:21,218 --> 02:42:22,744
You're gonna answer for it!

1566
02:42:24,225 --> 02:42:26,429
Ain't you the one who married the squaw?

1567
02:42:27,073 --> 02:42:29,375
What's the matter, boy?
Not having a good time?

1568
02:42:29,441 --> 02:42:32,409
Get them up, Rink! Everybody knows
you got this coming to you!

1569
02:42:32,481 --> 02:42:33,758
Jordy, no!

1570
02:42:51,361 --> 02:42:55,190
You want it in front of everybody,
or you want to come outside?

1571
02:42:56,320 --> 02:42:59,932
I don't care much whether it's here
or outside...

1572
02:43:00,544 --> 02:43:04,320
so long as I get one punch
at that stuck-up face of yours.

1573
02:43:08,224 --> 02:43:10,079
Sit down.

1574
02:43:13,760 --> 02:43:14,840
Governor.

1575
02:43:15,296 --> 02:43:16,921
How are you this evening?

1576
02:43:17,920 --> 02:43:22,076
<i>And now, to introduce our guest of honor,
we hear from a man...</i>

1577
02:43:22,368 --> 02:43:26,840
<i>known from the rocky coast of Maine
to the Golden Gate in California.</i>

1578
02:43:27,392 --> 02:43:30,207
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, our own...</i>

1579
02:43:30,592 --> 02:43:32,566
<i>Senator Oliver Whiteside.</i>

1580
02:43:58,623 --> 02:43:59,866
Get them up.

1581
02:44:01,503 --> 02:44:04,088
You had this coming to you
for a long time.

1582
02:44:09,662 --> 02:44:11,899
You'll get what you gave my boy.

1583
02:44:12,831 --> 02:44:13,779
Get them up.

1584
02:44:13,853 --> 02:44:14,934
Get them up!

1585
02:44:17,150 --> 02:44:19,091
<i>... proud, friendly...</i>

1586
02:44:19,582 --> 02:44:22,517
<i>warm-hearted, successful.</i>

1587
02:44:23,262 --> 02:44:26,426
<i>Yes, successful I am sure...</i>

1588
02:44:33,118 --> 02:44:35,190
You ain't even worth hitting.

1589
02:44:39,550 --> 02:44:41,589
You want to know something true?

1590
02:44:43,646 --> 02:44:45,020
You're all through.

1591
02:45:06,653 --> 02:45:09,653
<i>I'm going to ask you
to come with me tonight...</i>

1592
02:45:09,788 --> 02:45:13,945
<i>as I turn back the pages
in my book of happy memories...</i>

1593
02:45:14,396 --> 02:45:17,811
<i>and I recall the first time
I saw young Jett Rink.</i>

1594
02:45:17,884 --> 02:45:20,218
- Where's the boy?
- Juana took Jordy upstairs.

1595
02:45:20,317 --> 02:45:21,561
Let's get out of here.

1596
02:45:21,629 --> 02:45:22,937
I'll go get Luz.

1597
02:45:27,420 --> 02:45:29,176
Come on, Luz. We're leaving.

1598
02:45:29,884 --> 02:45:31,673
Excuse me, please.

1599
02:45:35,932 --> 02:45:37,940
<i>The years passed quickly...</i>

1600
02:45:38,459 --> 02:45:40,697
<i>as the years have a way of doing.</i>

1601
02:45:40,764 --> 02:45:42,258
<i>And now I see Jett Rink...</i>

1602
02:45:47,931 --> 02:45:52,120
<i>afraid of neither opposition
nor hard work...</i>

1603
02:45:52,507 --> 02:45:55,224
<i>his eyes set on the far distant...</i>

1604
02:45:55,292 --> 02:45:58,488
<i>goal toward which he's ever working...</i>

1605
02:45:58,906 --> 02:46:01,111
<i>planning, striving.</i>

1606
02:46:04,283 --> 02:46:06,835
<i>And now we come to Jett Rink, the man.</i>

1607
02:46:07,963 --> 02:46:10,351
<i>Texas has been kind to Jett Rink.</i>

1608
02:46:11,003 --> 02:46:14,484
<i>And Jett, never forgetting this kindness...</i>

1609
02:46:14,907 --> 02:46:17,493
<i>is ever ready to devote his resources...</i>

1610
02:46:17,914 --> 02:46:21,395
<i>to the greater glory of the state
which reared him...</i>

1611
02:46:21,467 --> 02:46:24,501
<i>which, in turn,
does honor to him tonight...</i>

1612
02:46:24,955 --> 02:46:28,271
<i>in this great gathering here at present.</i>

1613
02:46:29,946 --> 02:46:32,248
<i>And now, my friends, here...</i>

1614
02:46:32,539 --> 02:46:36,946
<i>and to the thousands of you
listening across the nation...</i>

1615
02:46:37,083 --> 02:46:39,951
<i>I have the privilege, yes...</i>

1616
02:46:40,826 --> 02:46:46,194
<i>I have the great honor to introduce
a legend in his own time...</i>

1617
02:46:46,810 --> 02:46:48,336
<i>a great Texan...</i>

1618
02:46:48,793 --> 02:46:51,282
<i>an outstanding American!</i>

1619
02:46:51,673 --> 02:46:54,708
<i>Yes, my friends, a man!</i>

1620
02:46:55,258 --> 02:46:58,072
<i>I give to you Jett Rink!</i>

1621
02:47:30,937 --> 02:47:32,660
You can count on me.

1622
02:47:36,919 --> 02:47:38,643
All right, goodbye.

1623
02:47:40,345 --> 02:47:41,424
How bad?

1624
02:47:41,849 --> 02:47:43,758
Got hit pretty hard in Vientecito.

1625
02:47:44,312 --> 02:47:48,402
Dr. Guerra set up an auxiliary hospital.
He needs help. I've got to go there.

1626
02:47:48,856 --> 02:47:52,117
You'll make better time
if you wait till first light and fly.

1627
02:47:52,344 --> 02:47:55,093
I hate to spend the night under Jett's roof.

1628
02:47:55,448 --> 02:48:00,085
Me, too. If we weren't transporting
a circus, we'd all hightail it out of here.

1629
02:48:15,896 --> 02:48:18,513
I hope she doesn't let this
upset her too much.

1630
02:48:19,127 --> 02:48:21,036
This business tonight...

1631
02:48:22,391 --> 02:48:26,613
it's just one of those things.
The best thing to do is forget about it.

1632
02:48:27,543 --> 02:48:30,739
Go ahead and forget it.
Me, I'm going to remember it!

1633
02:48:32,214 --> 02:48:33,676
Now look, Jordy.

1634
02:48:34,582 --> 02:48:35,826
Take it easy.

1635
02:48:36,758 --> 02:48:40,173
We've had just about enough excitement
around here for one night.

1636
02:48:40,823 --> 02:48:42,164
Yeah, I guess so.

1637
02:48:46,262 --> 02:48:49,295
You've always had a mind of your own
and used it.

1638
02:48:50,229 --> 02:48:52,466
You've done things your own way.

1639
02:48:56,055 --> 02:48:59,731
You knew what you were doing
when you married in that direction.

1640
02:49:02,005 --> 02:49:05,835
I told you myself the morning
after you broke the news, remember?

1641
02:49:07,221 --> 02:49:11,051
I told you then that I knew
Juana was a mighty fine little gal...

1642
02:49:12,598 --> 02:49:16,012
but that marrying her was asking
for trouble. Remember?

1643
02:49:16,438 --> 02:49:17,844
I told you that.

1644
02:49:19,637 --> 02:49:23,248
Lots of folks in these parts
get pretty jumpy about that sort of thing.

1645
02:49:23,316 --> 02:49:24,495
Jett's only one of them.

1646
02:49:24,565 --> 02:49:28,558
I know those people. We've run
into this before. We're doing fine.

1647
02:49:30,837 --> 02:49:34,349
I'm concerned it has to do with the people
that ought to know better.

1648
02:49:38,261 --> 02:49:39,689
Like my own father.

1649
02:49:41,971 --> 02:49:45,649
Just the simple truth. That's you.
That's the way you think.

1650
02:49:46,548 --> 02:49:50,827
I don't care about Jett Rink,
but you, Papa, that's different.

1651
02:49:51,284 --> 02:49:53,008
Now you look here, Jordy!

1652
02:49:53,716 --> 02:49:55,626
You can't talk to me like that.

1653
02:49:56,852 --> 02:49:58,511
No man can!

1654
02:50:00,852 --> 02:50:04,365
I'm a fair man. I've been fair all my life,
with everybody!

1655
02:50:05,140 --> 02:50:09,002
And you, my own son,
can't tell me that I'm not a fair man!

1656
02:50:13,011 --> 02:50:14,189
Look, Jordy...

1657
02:50:15,315 --> 02:50:18,413
there's ways of living,
and there's ways of doing things...

1658
02:50:18,547 --> 02:50:21,679
that folks abide by when they want
to live right and happily...

1659
02:50:21,747 --> 02:50:23,688
in the comfort of their own people.

1660
02:50:24,116 --> 02:50:27,149
I always say that Juana is
a mighty fine gal, but...

1661
02:50:27,219 --> 02:50:30,122
Don't sit there and prove what I say!
I don't like to hear it!

1662
02:50:30,674 --> 02:50:32,584
You're not being fair!

1663
02:50:34,132 --> 02:50:36,849
When that ruckus started,
who went after Rink?

1664
02:50:37,331 --> 02:50:39,087
Your old man.

1665
02:50:39,379 --> 02:50:42,128
- Who took him to account? Your old man.
- And why?

1666
02:50:43,091 --> 02:50:44,203
Because of my wife?

1667
02:50:44,274 --> 02:50:45,322
- Yes!
- No!

1668
02:50:45,683 --> 02:50:48,268
Because your son, Jordan Benedict...

1669
02:50:48,402 --> 02:50:51,369
descendant of the long, proud line
of Reata...

1670
02:50:51,442 --> 02:50:55,436
got knocked flat on his back
in front of all of Texas. That's why!

1671
02:51:11,922 --> 02:51:14,639
Forget it. Don't worry yourself about it.

1672
02:51:23,442 --> 02:51:27,848
Mom, you made a mistake when you got
yourself mixed up with us rowdy Texans.

1673
02:51:29,297 --> 02:51:33,804
I'm shocked at you! I'm shocked
at all of us! I'm just so ashamed!

1674
02:51:34,354 --> 02:51:38,444
I'll never forget the sight of my brother
barging into the grand ballroom...

1675
02:51:38,513 --> 02:51:42,953
with all of our friends, disgracing us!
Then my father made it a bigger brawl!

1676
02:51:43,024 --> 02:51:45,326
How can I face people again?

1677
02:51:45,392 --> 02:51:47,727
If you keep seeing Jett,
you won't have to face me.

1678
02:51:47,793 --> 02:51:48,807
Children!

1679
02:51:49,233 --> 02:51:51,087
How about that anyway, Mom?

1680
02:51:51,152 --> 02:51:52,876
I haven't been asked.

1681
02:51:52,945 --> 02:51:56,293
It seems that my family
just can't tolerate his success.

1682
02:51:56,592 --> 02:51:57,869
My darling, Luz.

1683
02:51:58,033 --> 02:52:01,065
Tonight meant a lot to Jett. Really. I know.

1684
02:52:02,641 --> 02:52:06,153
If I only knew how to apologize to him,
I'd go to him now.

1685
02:52:07,921 --> 02:52:10,310
But I can't face all those people.

1686
02:52:11,216 --> 02:52:13,289
The party is over. They've all gone home.

1687
02:52:14,832 --> 02:52:17,384
He passed out like a light
in front of the whole crowd.

1688
02:52:17,455 --> 02:52:18,568
Oh, no!

1689
02:52:18,991 --> 02:52:20,650
That's what we heard, Luz.

1690
02:52:22,383 --> 02:52:24,488
He must have been ill.

1691
02:52:25,328 --> 02:52:27,083
Weak with shame or something.

1692
02:52:27,503 --> 02:52:30,220
He was plain drunk, if you'll forgive me.

1693
02:52:31,280 --> 02:52:32,937
I don't believe you.

1694
02:52:34,640 --> 02:52:37,639
The party broke up early,
but not a minute too soon.

1695
02:52:44,048 --> 02:52:46,187
Give me Mr. Rink's penthouse, please.

1696
02:52:46,255 --> 02:52:49,768
You're not going up there,
even if I have to sit on you!

1697
02:52:51,023 --> 02:52:53,608
It's important. Do you know where he is?

1698
02:52:53,678 --> 02:52:56,549
Luz, it's not like you
to make a fool of yourself.

1699
02:52:57,966 --> 02:53:01,314
I know where he is, honey.
Come along with Uncle Bawley.

1700
02:53:03,503 --> 02:53:05,891
All right, Luz. If you must go.

1701
02:53:08,174 --> 02:53:09,287
I must.

1702
02:53:11,630 --> 02:53:14,664
I've always held a strange power
over your mother.

1703
02:53:22,030 --> 02:53:23,623
I'm sorry, Mother.

1704
02:53:34,413 --> 02:53:38,091
What do you say, doll face?
About ready to come along with me?

1705
02:53:40,845 --> 02:53:42,404
It's time we hit the hay.

1706
02:53:47,693 --> 02:53:48,805
I give up.

1707
02:53:53,710 --> 02:53:54,953
Can we go to work now?

1708
02:53:55,021 --> 02:53:58,369
Leave him alone.
He owns the place, let him enjoy it.

1709
02:53:58,445 --> 02:53:59,557
Shut up.

1710
02:54:00,588 --> 02:54:01,702
Shut up!

1711
02:54:19,788 --> 02:54:22,658
Ladies and gentlemen
and distinguished guests.

1712
02:54:26,604 --> 02:54:29,157
I just want to count the blessings...

1713
02:54:31,212 --> 02:54:34,725
that this great domain
has bestowed upon her humble son.

1714
02:54:37,163 --> 02:54:38,407
My friends...

1715
02:54:41,035 --> 02:54:42,858
this is a man.

1716
02:54:49,610 --> 02:54:51,204
Old Mother Texas!

1717
02:54:52,940 --> 02:54:54,849
What did she give to me?

1718
02:54:55,595 --> 02:54:57,985
Not a goddamn thing.

1719
02:54:58,475 --> 02:55:02,185
You've got to work and sweat
and steal it from her.

1720
02:55:04,811 --> 02:55:09,252
But I got mine right out of the ground.

1721
02:55:12,331 --> 02:55:13,760
Poor Jett...

1722
02:55:16,235 --> 02:55:18,273
fighting for what's good.

1723
02:55:18,955 --> 02:55:20,165
Flunky!

1724
02:55:21,610 --> 02:55:23,945
Flunky for Bick Benedict...

1725
02:55:25,323 --> 02:55:26,501
her husband.

1726
02:55:30,922 --> 02:55:32,231
Poor Jett!

1727
02:55:39,338 --> 02:55:41,093
Poor pretty Leslie!

1728
02:55:43,177 --> 02:55:44,289
Pretty Leslie...

1729
02:55:46,505 --> 02:55:50,629
Pretty Leslie.
Wonderful, beautiful girl bride!

1730
02:55:53,193 --> 02:55:54,469
Poor boy.

1731
02:55:55,434 --> 02:55:56,448
Rich...

1732
02:55:57,129 --> 02:55:58,623
Rich Mrs. Benedict.

1733
02:56:02,602 --> 02:56:04,194
She's beautiful.

1734
02:56:05,609 --> 02:56:06,754
Lovely.

1735
02:56:07,528 --> 02:56:09,022
The woman a man wants.

1736
02:56:10,216 --> 02:56:12,453
A woman a man has got to have, too!

1737
02:56:35,368 --> 02:56:37,255
Thank you, Uncle Bawley.

1738
02:56:39,849 --> 02:56:41,059
Governor...

1739
02:56:45,223 --> 02:56:47,166
you know what you can do?

1740
02:57:23,622 --> 02:57:25,533
As soon as it lands, I'll sell it.

1741
02:57:25,831 --> 02:57:26,496
Good.

1742
02:57:26,566 --> 02:57:27,711
This is for me, boy.

1743
02:57:27,782 --> 02:57:28,960
The simple life.

1744
02:57:29,030 --> 02:57:31,070
No more of this high-flying nonsense.

1745
02:58:00,262 --> 02:58:03,392
Juana, how does a hamburger
and a piece of pie sound to you?

1746
02:58:03,461 --> 02:58:04,607
Sounds very good.

1747
02:58:05,670 --> 02:58:07,906
No more of this highfalutin stuff.

1748
02:58:08,037 --> 02:58:10,623
Let's stop at this drive-in
and have us some chicken.

1749
02:58:10,693 --> 02:58:12,482
Then we can eat it with our fingers.

1750
02:59:02,179 --> 02:59:05,855
Nice place you have here. I've been
intending to stop every time I drove by.

1751
02:59:05,923 --> 02:59:07,035
Thank you.

1752
02:59:07,140 --> 02:59:09,595
What do you recommend?
How is the fried chicken?

1753
02:59:09,700 --> 02:59:12,121
Little Jordy wants ice cream, Grandpa.

1754
02:59:13,635 --> 02:59:14,650
Grandpa?

1755
02:59:16,483 --> 02:59:18,239
Ice cream it shall be.

1756
02:59:19,427 --> 02:59:21,499
Give the little fellow some ice cream.

1757
02:59:21,667 --> 02:59:23,293
Ice cream?

1758
02:59:23,363 --> 02:59:25,664
I thought that kid would want a tamale.

1759
02:59:36,322 --> 02:59:38,233
Give them what they want.

1760
02:59:54,307 --> 02:59:56,445
What do you say? Is this all right?

1761
02:59:57,346 --> 02:59:58,623
It's good.

1762
02:59:59,937 --> 03:00:02,490
After all that fancy food and high living.

1763
03:00:02,785 --> 03:00:04,095
This is the life.

1764
03:00:20,513 --> 03:00:21,626
Hey, you.

1765
03:00:24,834 --> 03:00:28,378
The plane should arrive in Benedict
around 1:30.

1766
03:00:32,257 --> 03:00:34,167
You're in the wrong place.

1767
03:00:34,369 --> 03:00:36,606
Come on, let's get out of here.

1768
03:00:38,112 --> 03:00:39,836
Your money is no good here.

1769
03:00:41,249 --> 03:00:42,842
Come on, let's go.

1770
03:00:44,641 --> 03:00:45,655
You, too.

1771
03:00:45,793 --> 03:00:47,135
Hold on a minute.

1772
03:00:54,399 --> 03:00:56,156
Yes, what do you want?

1773
03:00:58,017 --> 03:01:02,806
Look here, Sarge. I'd sure appreciate it
if you were more polite to these people.

1774
03:01:03,903 --> 03:01:05,333
You would, eh?

1775
03:01:06,240 --> 03:01:09,273
I'm Bick Benedict.
Your neighbor, you might say.

1776
03:01:09,919 --> 03:01:12,504
Does that give you special privileges?

1777
03:01:12,864 --> 03:01:17,141
The name Benedict's meant something
to people around here for a long time.

1778
03:01:19,520 --> 03:01:21,691
That there papoose down there...

1779
03:01:22,751 --> 03:01:24,410
is his name Benedict, too?

1780
03:01:31,871 --> 03:01:34,969
Yes. Come to think of it, it is.

1781
03:01:37,279 --> 03:01:38,937
Forget I asked you.

1782
03:01:39,391 --> 03:01:42,391
Go sit down,
and we ain't gonna have no trouble.

1783
03:01:42,687 --> 03:01:45,207
But this bunch's gonna eat
somewhere else.

1784
03:01:46,495 --> 03:01:48,054
All right, come on. Let's go.

1785
03:01:48,127 --> 03:01:49,534
Come on, you, too.

1786
03:01:53,502 --> 03:01:55,575
You're out of line, mister.

1787
03:04:13,434 --> 03:04:16,303
Is that the best
that old horse thief can do?

1788
03:04:17,050 --> 03:04:20,246
He's feeling your mood, darling.

1789
03:04:21,530 --> 03:04:24,497
<i>There's a lot of Clair de Lune
in both of you old fire-eaters.</i>

1790
03:04:25,466 --> 03:04:27,703
You're both rather gentle creatures.

1791
03:04:28,121 --> 03:04:29,398
How awful!

1792
03:04:33,210 --> 03:04:34,640
Those kids...

1793
03:04:35,322 --> 03:04:36,751
Look at them.

1794
03:04:37,209 --> 03:04:40,525
Those kids, in their infinite wisdom,
are smarter than we are.

1795
03:04:41,529 --> 03:04:44,246
They know I'm a disgrace.
And they don't hesitate to say so.

1796
03:04:46,554 --> 03:04:48,790
Even the calf's got my number.

1797
03:04:50,969 --> 03:04:53,522
I don't have to take it from a sheep!

1798
03:04:54,904 --> 03:04:56,334
Now, Jordan!

1799
03:05:02,937 --> 03:05:06,733
Hello, Vashti. We're all fine.
How'd you make it back?

1800
03:05:09,656 --> 03:05:12,373
- They all made it back in one piece.
- Jolly.

1801
03:05:13,080 --> 03:05:16,430
Yes, all our guests have finally gone.
Thank goodness!

1802
03:05:19,096 --> 03:05:21,649
But more have left than we bargained for.

1803
03:05:21,849 --> 03:05:25,677
Luz has gone on to Hollywood with Lola,
whatever the name was.

1804
03:05:27,991 --> 03:05:31,187
She decided she would like to see
how she liked Hollywood.

1805
03:05:33,207 --> 03:05:34,931
We never had one in the family.

1806
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:36,757
Good Lord, an actress!

1807
03:05:39,128 --> 03:05:43,284
All you can do is raise them.
You can't live their lives for them.

1808
03:05:46,168 --> 03:05:48,655
Judy and Bob are out looking at a ranch.

1809
03:05:49,399 --> 03:05:50,480
A small one.

1810
03:05:52,632 --> 03:05:55,501
Jordy and Juana are gonna move
into Vientecito.

1811
03:05:55,767 --> 03:05:58,670
And we, we're home minding the babies.

1812
03:06:03,511 --> 03:06:07,667
The sun's going down over the yardarm.
When are you going to open up the bar?

1813
03:06:07,736 --> 03:06:09,196
Anytime. Go ahead.

1814
03:06:10,520 --> 03:06:13,301
Remember, one of these days
that bourbon's gonna kill you.

1815
03:06:13,366 --> 03:06:15,472
Okay. It'll be me or it.

1816
03:06:16,119 --> 03:06:17,777
One of us has got to go.

1817
03:06:20,086 --> 03:06:23,600
I'm going to stay right here.
It's coming onto spring.

1818
03:06:24,725 --> 03:06:27,595
Roundup time is no time
to be away from Reata.

1819
03:06:37,046 --> 03:06:40,875
Honey, everybody's on the move.
The strays are leaving the herd.

1820
03:06:43,285 --> 03:06:48,370
I wouldn't mind it too much if you wanted
to pack up and go back home for a spell.

1821
03:06:49,845 --> 03:06:50,859
Home?

1822
03:06:52,085 --> 03:06:56,241
Where do you think I've been
this last breathless quarter of a century?

1823
03:06:57,589 --> 03:06:58,669
Home.

1824
03:06:59,253 --> 03:07:01,326
Look, boy, I belong here!

1825
03:07:04,181 --> 03:07:07,051
You really want to know
what's gotten my goat?

1826
03:07:09,205 --> 03:07:11,922
My own grandson doesn't even look
like one of us.

1827
03:07:12,277 --> 03:07:14,796
He really looks like a little wetback.

1828
03:07:20,597 --> 03:07:22,986
Little "muchacho" fires up, don't he?

1829
03:07:24,564 --> 03:07:26,572
I'm sorry, Jordan Benedict IV.

1830
03:07:27,284 --> 03:07:29,520
There's times when a man
just has to be honest.

1831
03:07:32,820 --> 03:07:34,544
You know something, Leslie?

1832
03:07:35,669 --> 03:07:37,391
There's no use kidding.

1833
03:07:38,485 --> 03:07:39,913
I'm a failure.

1834
03:07:40,627 --> 03:07:43,727
Nothing has turned out like I had planned.

1835
03:07:47,219 --> 03:07:50,416
I just feel like my saddle's turning
right out from under me.

1836
03:07:53,235 --> 03:07:55,024
Do you want to know something?

1837
03:07:57,364 --> 03:07:59,120
I think you're great!

1838
03:08:01,780 --> 03:08:05,128
Don't ask me why.
Some things are difficult to explain.

1839
03:08:06,547 --> 03:08:10,671
You know all that fine riding
you used to do, and all that fancy roping...

1840
03:08:10,739 --> 03:08:13,673
and all that glamour stuff
you did to dazzle me?

1841
03:08:13,810 --> 03:08:15,272
It was impressive.

1842
03:08:16,755 --> 03:08:20,104
But none of it ever made you
quite as big a man to me...

1843
03:08:20,690 --> 03:08:23,887
as you were on the floor
of Sarge's hamburger joint.

1844
03:08:28,051 --> 03:08:30,058
When you tumbled rearward...

1845
03:08:30,227 --> 03:08:33,576
and landed crashing
into that pile of dirty dishes...

1846
03:08:34,929 --> 03:08:37,166
you were at last my hero.

1847
03:08:38,515 --> 03:08:40,970
That's what you always wanted to be.

1848
03:08:41,586 --> 03:08:42,568
Could be.

1849
03:08:43,251 --> 03:08:46,763
When we went into that place,
before the fight started...

1850
03:08:48,754 --> 03:08:51,339
What a fight! It was glorious!

1851
03:08:52,817 --> 03:08:56,232
Before we went in,
I was feeling like you are now.

1852
03:08:57,201 --> 03:08:58,958
I was thinking to myself:

1853
03:08:59,537 --> 03:09:00,584
"Well...

1854
03:09:00,657 --> 03:09:04,334
"Jordan and I, and the others behind us,
have been failures".

1855
03:09:05,777 --> 03:09:07,272
And then it happened.

1856
03:09:08,274 --> 03:09:12,551
You wound up on the floor, on your back,
in the middle of the salad.

1857
03:09:14,002 --> 03:09:15,407
And I said to myself:

1858
03:09:16,434 --> 03:09:17,448
"Well...

1859
03:09:18,192 --> 03:09:20,265
"after 100 years...

1860
03:09:21,232 --> 03:09:23,021
"the Benedict family...

1861
03:09:23,280 --> 03:09:25,899
"is a real big success".

1862
03:09:28,400 --> 03:09:30,473
You want to know something, Leslie?

1863
03:09:31,985 --> 03:09:33,893
If I live to be 90...

1864
03:09:35,697 --> 03:09:38,414
I'll never be able to figure you out.
