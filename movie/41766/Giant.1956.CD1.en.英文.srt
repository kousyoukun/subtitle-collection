1
00:04:36,592 --> 00:04:39,152
We'll get to the horses

2
00:04:39,228 --> 00:04:42,391
Now you'll come up to the house

3
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:23,599
l came to buy your stallion, War Winds,

4
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,867
ln all likelihood,

5
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:35,746
David is with the embassy in Washington.

6
00:05:43,626 --> 00:05:47,619
Mother! Let me sell Mr. Benedict

7
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,795
For one, he eats too much,

8
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,201
You see, it's either War Winds or me.

9
00:05:58,508 --> 00:06:02,103
You know that horse is just too spirited

10
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:07,742
l know your horse is going to miss you

11
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:18,957
You must tell us about Texas,

12
00:06:28,504 --> 00:06:32,167
At least that's what we think.

13
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:37,573
From an Englishman's point of view,

14
00:06:45,888 --> 00:06:49,221
Mr. Benedict's Reata is

15
00:07:01,604 --> 00:07:06,234
There are one or two others as big,

16
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,005
and some larger ones

17
00:07:13,883 --> 00:07:17,876
What's the size of your place?

18
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,092
Around a half million.

19
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:34,626
how many acres did you say,

20
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:41,099
And you should see the greedy look

21
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:48,005
Won't you join us at the hunt Ball?

22
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:53,080
l'm afraid l wouldn't look good

23
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:19,141
Why don't you stay a while

24
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,408
lt's roundup time in my country.

25
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:34,520
Your country, my country.

26
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,845
l'm not going to say goodbye to you

27
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:58,600
Will you do me a favor

28
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,911
-Leslie?

29
00:12:01,203 --> 00:12:04,661
-$10,000 is a lot of money.

30
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:24,822
-Why, Leslie!

31
00:12:36,705 --> 00:12:40,368
You don't look as if you'd been dancing

32
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:49,911
Let the poor boy

33
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,995
You're catching me a bit early

34
00:13:08,237 --> 00:13:12,105
But l'm not joking.

35
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:16,304
Mr. Austin came down

36
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:19,747
The next thing you know,

37
00:13:23,586 --> 00:13:27,078
l never heard anything as ignorant

38
00:13:28,757 --> 00:13:31,317
l'm only speaking impersonally.

39
00:13:31,827 --> 00:13:34,421
You all think

40
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:42,331
Do you know about San Jacinto?

41
00:13:50,212 --> 00:13:53,545
l didn't mean to be impolite,

42
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:04,352
You mustn't talk that way to a Texan.

43
00:14:08,397 --> 00:14:12,390
Jordan, you would think

44
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:35,648
First you attack a man's country,

45
00:14:40,663 --> 00:14:42,187
-Good morning.

46
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:44,889
-Good morning, Lacey.

47
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:52,539
We'll have to be getting along soon

48
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:59,174
-Good morning, everybody.

49
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:19,958
Leslie, if Mr. Benedict has finished

50
00:15:22,805 --> 00:15:27,299
We've just quarreled politely about Texas.

51
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:36,174
he's probably engaged to marry

52
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:39,552
who, though beautiful,

53
00:15:39,888 --> 00:15:43,221
She only has 200,000 acres

54
00:15:55,771 --> 00:15:58,433
Mr. Benedict and l will have

55
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:19,083
Who, may l ask, is the lucky young lady

56
00:16:28,303 --> 00:16:32,296
lt's funny, ma'am.

57
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:45,453
There was some talk of my marrying her,

58
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:45,638
Don't you think you've done

59
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,356
l don't know how other brides feel

60
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:23,286
My old man built it to show the cotton

61
00:22:30,065 --> 00:22:34,434
She's run the house since Ma passed on.

62
00:23:06,601 --> 00:23:10,867
here we don't make a fuss

63
00:23:23,085 --> 00:23:27,522
l still have a mind of my own.

64
00:23:40,368 --> 00:23:44,099
standing here quarreling

65
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,054
We weren't expected to be back sooner,

66
00:24:41,463 --> 00:24:44,557
With all the spring work to be done,

67
00:24:50,105 --> 00:24:54,371
lf l miss a roundup every time l have

68
00:25:11,526 --> 00:25:14,359
Where do you think you're going

69
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:20,763
Don't go taking off on me.

70
00:25:32,647 --> 00:25:35,480
But she said,

71
00:25:37,752 --> 00:25:40,915
Bick and Jett are everlasting jangling

72
00:25:42,057 --> 00:25:45,288
-Madama is the one who told me to stay.

73
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,118
With you away,

74
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:52,657
They're all scared to death of her.

75
00:26:00,108 --> 00:26:04,670
and l'll be glad to do anything you want.

76
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:14,912
-hello.

77
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,694
You'd better get going, Jett,

78
00:26:45,553 --> 00:26:49,887
l'm sorry, honey. Things go loco here

79
00:26:58,133 --> 00:27:01,330
Old Kale Beebe blew in,

80
00:27:04,806 --> 00:27:09,300
he must have had nightmares.

81
00:27:32,534 --> 00:27:36,527
We'll make that into a sitting room

82
00:28:34,496 --> 00:28:36,862
You and Jordan

83
00:28:36,931 --> 00:28:40,924
We have our coffee and talk

84
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:48,937
l thought l was going riding with him

85
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,843
lt would've been too hot for you.

86
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,820
You gotta watch out for that sun.

87
00:29:05,126 --> 00:29:08,618
Your blood's too thin. That's the trouble

88
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:21,405
l'm a lot tougher perhaps

89
00:29:27,315 --> 00:29:31,809
l never had a sick day in my life.

90
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,428
Don't you worry none

91
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,271
Yes, indeed.

92
00:30:00,582 --> 00:30:03,016
l'd like you to meet

93
00:30:09,157 --> 00:30:12,354
how do you do, Mrs. Benedict?

94
00:30:12,427 --> 00:30:15,487
Bick, congratulations.

95
00:30:44,225 --> 00:30:46,625
Now you'll meet the neighbor

96
00:30:46,694 --> 00:30:50,357
The one who lives 50 miles away

97
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:24,660
My name is Mort Snythe.

98
00:31:32,106 --> 00:31:34,438
-Excuse me, ma'am.

99
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:18,311
-This will perk you up, Miss Leslie.

100
00:32:19,587 --> 00:32:22,579
l propose a toast to a daughter

101
00:32:22,757 --> 00:32:27,251
now blooming into a citizen

102
00:32:39,007 --> 00:32:42,807
-There's more than one bride here today.

103
00:32:44,012 --> 00:32:47,311
Mort Snythe and l were married yesterday

104
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:11,231
Why, Luz, everybody in the county knows

105
00:33:14,442 --> 00:33:17,434
You put your brand on one of them,

106
00:34:05,727 --> 00:34:10,061
We take it and wrap it in clean white cloth

107
00:34:10,565 --> 00:34:14,023
and put it down in a pit

108
00:34:19,507 --> 00:34:24,171
l don't think l'm really terribly hungry.

109
00:35:24,472 --> 00:35:27,771
l think there's something

110
00:35:28,843 --> 00:35:32,335
l don't want to take your place.

111
00:35:32,814 --> 00:35:35,806
But l can't have you

112
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,547
l can't be just a guest

113
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,320
-how are you feeling?

114
00:35:52,266 --> 00:35:56,259
l want everybody to know, no matter

115
00:36:07,348 --> 00:36:10,010
l'll never get the hang of you,

116
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:29,102
A horse that cost you a lot

117
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:32,367
l wouldn't let anyone ride him.

118
00:36:34,075 --> 00:36:37,374
l'd see she rides a more gentle animal

119
00:37:22,056 --> 00:37:25,958
There's never been anything like them

120
00:37:37,738 --> 00:37:40,366
Granddaddy and his boys

121
00:37:40,441 --> 00:37:43,410
great herds of them,

122
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,950
he was a pretty good old boy.

123
00:37:53,421 --> 00:37:56,857
My old man brought in stock from Europe

124
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:46,956
hold on a minute. l want you

125
00:39:51,939 --> 00:39:54,635
There's no use overdoing it.

126
00:40:34,115 --> 00:40:36,276
They understand English

127
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,547
l know how to handle Mexicans.

128
00:40:40,488 --> 00:40:43,821
They'd sit on their honkers all day

129
00:40:48,729 --> 00:40:51,789
l thought we ought to talk

130
00:40:54,969 --> 00:40:58,166
l don't want to feel that you're setting up

131
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,111
And you're fair enough, l think,

132
00:41:19,293 --> 00:41:22,262
l'll get a horse and help push

133
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:41,541
l mean, everybody else's trying

134
00:41:55,829 --> 00:41:59,925
Who gets hold of this much land

135
00:42:01,702 --> 00:42:04,637
You're not exactly loyal

136
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,317
-They got it though purchase, years ago.

137
00:42:17,384 --> 00:42:21,548
That's not true. They bought and traded

138
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,821
They paid for it all right.

139
00:42:28,162 --> 00:42:31,154
l know my folks were here long enough

140
00:43:27,621 --> 00:43:30,055
l've been riding what l want to

141
00:43:32,259 --> 00:43:35,422
lf he bucks me down,

142
00:43:37,765 --> 00:43:41,132
l suppose you came out here

143
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:07,053
l've got a few friends.

144
00:44:08,429 --> 00:44:12,763
And Bick....

145
00:44:14,868 --> 00:44:18,497
Of course,

146
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,368
kind of divvy up

147
00:44:28,215 --> 00:44:32,117
You're an odd one, aren't you, Jett?

148
00:44:43,897 --> 00:44:48,231
You're the best-looking gal

149
00:44:51,405 --> 00:44:55,205
The prettiest one

150
00:45:00,881 --> 00:45:03,679
l'll tell my husband of that,

151
00:45:59,273 --> 00:46:01,764
Them kids there.

152
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:13,282
Sure in good shape, ain't they?

153
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:33,039
You're the boss.

154
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:40,322
Mrs. Leslie,

155
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:53,112
Try not to worry, Mrs. Obregon.

156
00:49:34,521 --> 00:49:38,321
Where in the world have you been?

157
00:49:54,274 --> 00:49:56,606
She might have been thrown

158
00:50:25,338 --> 00:50:29,001
She could ride anything.

159
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:46,368
This is a great misfortune,

160
00:53:08,702 --> 00:53:12,001
-Mrs. Benedict, this is Dr. Borneholm.

161
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:19,108
Dr. Walker did everything he could,

162
00:53:23,717 --> 00:53:26,914
Dr. Walker, there's more for you to do,

163
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:35,121
his temperature must be at least 105.

164
00:54:07,928 --> 00:54:09,623
-Our doctor?

165
00:54:21,274 --> 00:54:24,072
They have a way of doing things

166
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:32,675
Now, don't go climbing on me.

167
00:54:33,053 --> 00:54:36,420
Jordan, darling,

168
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:40,481
There's a child who's very sick.

169
00:56:06,546 --> 00:56:09,743
Somebody had to do it.

170
00:56:40,513 --> 00:56:44,005
We need you in here for a few minutes

171
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:50,384
ln times like this

172
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:12,174
lt's the biggest gathering for a funeral

173
00:57:15,982 --> 00:57:19,247
l mean, she always did like

174
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:25,922
-Come to see us.

175
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:34,360
l think you'll agree, your sister

176
00:57:36,102 --> 00:57:39,799
She wanted that boy

177
00:57:47,147 --> 00:57:51,140
l'm going to ask you, in reverence

178
00:57:51,918 --> 00:57:54,944
l'm going to ask you

179
00:57:58,758 --> 00:58:01,090
We can clean up the whole matter

180
00:58:22,515 --> 00:58:25,814
l lost the one friend l had in this place,

181
00:58:26,686 --> 00:58:30,019
So l quit, l dead quit.

182
00:58:39,465 --> 00:58:42,127
Come inside and listen

183
00:58:42,569 --> 00:58:44,867
Come on in here, Jett.

184
00:58:48,808 --> 00:58:51,072
-howdy, Jett. Good to see you.

185
00:58:51,344 --> 00:58:54,677
have my seat, boy. Sit right down.

186
00:58:55,582 --> 00:58:59,518
Sit down. l'm going to tell you about

187
00:58:59,586 --> 00:59:02,749
Sit down, young man,

188
00:59:03,556 --> 00:59:07,083
lt's a real bad wind

189
00:59:10,363 --> 00:59:15,062
l don't have to tell you that Luz was

190
00:59:18,238 --> 00:59:22,572
She prepared a list of things she wanted

191
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:31,977
We find that her bequest to you was

192
00:59:33,553 --> 00:59:36,545
lt's the little piece we used to call

193
00:59:42,262 --> 00:59:45,254
She wanted to give you something.

194
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:51,594
lt's always been my aim to try

195
00:59:53,906 --> 00:59:57,899
Now, that little piece is worth at most....

196
01:00:03,116 --> 01:00:06,279
Mr. Benedict, wanting to honor

197
01:00:06,753 --> 01:00:10,621
and, of course, right along

198
01:00:11,324 --> 01:00:15,158
he wants to see to it that you get

199
01:00:19,132 --> 01:00:22,727
we're prepared to place in your hands,

200
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:44,649
which, any of these gentlemen here

201
01:00:46,926 --> 01:00:50,623
-Definitely.

202
01:01:05,378 --> 01:01:09,371
That's a lot of money.

203
01:01:46,252 --> 01:01:49,983
l want you to know

204
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:11,800
a pretty good idea

205
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:11,459
There's one thing on this earth more

206
01:03:17,009 --> 01:03:20,240
lf you ever get to Deep Smith,

207
01:03:22,815 --> 01:03:26,114
Only a little-bitty, no-account piece,

208
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:29,620
-Only? Why, a gusher came in last year.

209
01:03:32,024 --> 01:03:34,254
-A million gallons?

210
01:03:40,132 --> 01:03:43,124
-Goodbye. Thanks for treating us right.

211
01:06:25,097 --> 01:06:27,327
to take you around

212
01:06:32,004 --> 01:06:35,440
l'm so impatient.

213
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:40,868
You don't have to hurry, honey.

214
01:06:45,351 --> 01:06:49,344
And when you've seen it all

215
01:06:51,223 --> 01:06:55,125
in 25 years from now,

216
01:06:58,831 --> 01:07:01,629
Twenty-five years from now

217
01:07:05,571 --> 01:07:08,563
You'll see wonderful things in Texas

218
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:21,408
Because then

219
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,262
You get with it, Gomez.

220
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:40,867
l don't want any of them

221
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:43,942
Everything will be bueno, senor.

222
01:08:30,422 --> 01:08:33,391
You married me in Washington,

223
01:08:33,926 --> 01:08:37,089
l lived next door to politics.

224
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:47,928
Leslie, how about a cup of coffee

225
01:08:59,285 --> 01:09:03,654
Set up my spinning wheel, girls.

226
01:09:05,357 --> 01:09:08,656
Don't you go worrying

227
01:09:09,361 --> 01:09:12,159
You mean my pretty, empty head,

228
01:09:29,982 --> 01:09:32,746
My adrenaline glands

229
01:09:44,697 --> 01:09:48,030
You ought to be wearing leopard skins

230
01:09:52,004 --> 01:09:55,963
What's so masculine about a conversation

231
01:10:23,435 --> 01:10:26,427
l reckon l'll go on upstairs

232
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:48,786
Send the children on up to bed

233
01:11:36,108 --> 01:11:39,874
Darling, l am sorry

234
01:11:42,114 --> 01:11:45,277
l'll apologize to the others first thing,

235
01:11:47,619 --> 01:11:50,247
You certainly distinguished yourself

236
01:11:50,322 --> 01:11:52,950
-Shh, they can hear.

237
01:11:53,025 --> 01:11:56,756
Every word you said out there.

238
01:12:07,539 --> 01:12:11,066
You come down here

239
01:12:20,052 --> 01:12:24,512
l'm asking you, when will you settle down

240
01:12:25,858 --> 01:12:28,349
-Never!

241
01:12:57,222 --> 01:13:00,214
Preaching stuff that's none

242
01:13:01,693 --> 01:13:05,151
honestly, Jordan.

243
01:13:11,403 --> 01:13:14,201
You knew what a frightful girl l was

244
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:22,040
From the first moment,

245
01:14:04,990 --> 01:14:07,891
That fine mind of yours

246
01:14:19,771 --> 01:14:22,399
l thought what we said on the train

247
01:14:27,312 --> 01:14:30,304
But l'll never forget a single word

248
01:15:12,324 --> 01:15:15,657
What a glorious, gorgeous,

249
01:15:29,174 --> 01:15:32,143
And a woman

250
01:15:55,067 --> 01:15:57,695
The best part about quarreling

251
01:15:59,705 --> 01:16:02,674
When we make up, we make up.

252
01:16:05,611 --> 01:16:10,275
Why can't we take a trip, really see Texas?

253
01:16:23,428 --> 01:16:25,953
Everything that's in it and on it

254
01:16:30,936 --> 01:16:34,167
Everything that has a Reata brand on it

255
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:45,677
That's the way my father ran this outfit

256
01:16:46,351 --> 01:16:49,184
he kept it together for his son,

257
01:17:03,635 --> 01:17:06,968
Don't you think that might be

258
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:40,368
Why didn't you tell me?

259
01:17:42,874 --> 01:17:44,466
-Are you sure?

260
01:17:46,778 --> 01:17:50,236
And our baby is going to be a boy.

261
01:18:11,803 --> 01:18:14,033
Shouldn't she be putting on

262
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:20,738
lt's natural, l think,

263
01:18:45,036 --> 01:18:48,665
''l'm helping a young Dr. Guerra

264
01:18:49,341 --> 01:18:53,334
''Almost every day l find myself

265
01:18:54,246 --> 01:18:58,706
''through the dusty and dirty streets

266
01:19:26,912 --> 01:19:30,245
Mr. Gomez, l'm going to leave

267
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:33,116
he'll tell you things

268
01:19:37,088 --> 01:19:39,886
Thank you, Dr. Guerra.

269
01:20:16,428 --> 01:20:18,521
-howdy, Miss Leslie.

270
01:20:22,434 --> 01:20:25,028
-You made some improvements.

271
01:20:40,752 --> 01:20:44,848
Truthfully, l didn't expect this sort

272
01:20:47,058 --> 01:20:50,516
That's the first time l was ever accused

273
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:03,573
l'll have a place

274
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:18,478
l thought maybe they'd kind of

275
01:21:31,703 --> 01:21:35,002
Do you want to come on in here,

276
01:21:47,419 --> 01:21:50,320
having kids seems to agree with you,

277
01:22:15,747 --> 01:22:19,649
l love it. lt seems down here everybody

278
01:22:39,671 --> 01:22:42,299
Mind if l pay you

279
01:23:25,617 --> 01:23:29,576
Don't you need somebody to help you

280
01:23:31,056 --> 01:23:34,924
When l get some time to look around,

281
01:23:38,363 --> 01:23:42,857
You got any attractive sisters there that

282
01:24:00,085 --> 01:24:03,054
why don't they help themselves

283
01:24:04,856 --> 01:24:08,417
When you say ''other people,''

284
01:24:18,770 --> 01:24:21,603
You don't go mixing me up

285
01:24:22,507 --> 01:24:27,137
l'm just as much of Texas

286
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:33,675
-l'm no wetback.

287
01:24:36,121 --> 01:24:40,080
You're very like Jordan in that respect.

288
01:24:41,226 --> 01:24:44,559
But your situation is so different.

289
01:25:50,195 --> 01:25:53,187
Gomez telephoned.

290
01:25:55,767 --> 01:25:58,759
l've told you before....

291
01:26:13,084 --> 01:26:16,178
You can't go around this place

292
01:26:25,897 --> 01:26:29,333
You've been a powerful Texan for

293
01:26:35,306 --> 01:26:38,207
if l ever hear you get mixed up

294
01:26:38,243 --> 01:26:39,676
-What?

295
01:26:49,721 --> 01:26:54,055
Did you think your naughty mama was

296
01:26:56,761 --> 01:27:00,322
One of these days l'll run

297
01:27:37,869 --> 01:27:40,861
l don't care what you say.

298
01:27:44,609 --> 01:27:47,772
We're all gathered for the fourth

299
01:27:52,583 --> 01:27:55,211
And l want to take

300
01:27:59,324 --> 01:28:01,952
is gonna grow up to be

301
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:11,792
Maybe he'll even grow up

302
01:29:10,194 --> 01:29:13,357
But that was you.

303
01:29:13,765 --> 01:29:18,464
he is a Benedict. he's gonna stay

304
01:29:42,126 --> 01:29:43,855
-No.

305
01:31:08,479 --> 01:31:11,971
Bick knows everything about running

306
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:16,983
he doesn't know a thing

307
01:31:22,093 --> 01:31:25,494
and help those children grow up to be

308
01:31:39,110 --> 01:31:41,442
-Good night, Leslie.

309
01:31:41,512 --> 01:31:45,972
-Good night.

310
01:31:58,229 --> 01:32:01,460
-Good night, Bick.

311
01:32:05,670 --> 01:32:09,162
Good night, everybody.

312
01:32:45,409 --> 01:32:48,901
What's happening is we're getting

313
01:32:53,684 --> 01:32:57,085
We've been together every day and night

314
01:33:04,829 --> 01:33:07,627
We're getting in the habit

315
01:33:11,135 --> 01:33:13,797
about things

316
01:33:20,811 --> 01:33:25,475
l think it would be a good idea

317
01:33:38,629 --> 01:33:41,564
-That's not the way l want it, Jordan.

318
01:33:47,238 --> 01:33:50,207
lt'll be better for us

319
01:33:55,980 --> 01:33:59,108
lt'll give us both a chance

320
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:07,183
-hi, there.

321
01:35:20,731 --> 01:35:23,928
lf l had it to do again,

322
01:35:31,542 --> 01:35:34,534
with this wedding and Thanksgiving

323
01:36:15,686 --> 01:36:20,419
Merciful Father, we bow our heads

324
01:36:21,425 --> 01:36:24,917
We give thee humble and hearty thanks

325
01:36:26,096 --> 01:36:28,621
beseeching thee to continue

326
01:36:29,433 --> 01:36:34,461
that our land may still yield her increase,

327
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:31,658
lt's a day

328
01:38:11,302 --> 01:38:15,102
but he says,

329
01:38:16,307 --> 01:38:20,971
''l want them to know l miss them

330
01:39:04,855 --> 01:39:09,087
l could see you coming.

331
01:39:11,161 --> 01:39:14,460
We're having a wedding.

332
01:40:23,033 --> 01:40:27,697
''we are gathered here in the sight of God

333
01:40:28,338 --> 01:40:32,832
''to join together this man

334
01:40:33,644 --> 01:40:37,444
''which is an honorable estate

335

We Texans like a little vinegar

When Bick finishes this breeding program,

01:43:38,362 --> 01:43:41,388
that's 99 percent beef

Jett's got the easement, Bick.

l'm tired of his prospecting.

356
01:45:01,244 --> 01:45:05,112
he's borrowed about all he could.

357
01:45:08,852 --> 01:45:12,583
Buy him out, Ollie.

358
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:49,479
You all thought Spindletop and

359
01:46:54,858 --> 01:46:57,520
There ain't a dang thing

360
01:47:00,130 --> 01:47:02,462
And there's more down there,

361
01:47:17,981 --> 01:47:21,576
l'm gonna have more money

362
01:47:21,685 --> 01:47:24,313
You and the rest of you

363

Leslie, go into the house.

364
01:49:24,659 --> 01:49:28,390
He is to cease using the name of my ranch

365
01:49:28,462 --> 01:49:32,364
l won't have oil digging on Reata.

366
01:50:23,517 --> 01:50:26,452
They say Aunt Luz was really in love

367
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:29,045
Even if she was old enough

368
01:50:32,793 --> 01:50:35,455
She was always trying to keep him

369
01:50:50,111 --> 01:50:53,877
That every girl in Texas was trying

370

''There wasn't a prize bull like him

371

l'm sure it's quite true, darling.

372
01:51:10,331 --> 01:51:14,131
Really? lt all sounds so fascinating

373
01:52:13,194 --> 01:52:15,662
_Howdy, Mr. Benedict.

374
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:52,422
l want to go to Harvard

375
01:53:01,175 --> 01:53:04,804
How about Reata, Jordy?

376
01:53:10,351 --> 01:53:13,514
But there are 50,000 guys who can do it

377
01:53:14,188 --> 01:53:17,055
l don't want to live my life

378
01:53:22,630 --> 01:53:26,623
Your father doesn't want you to die

379
01:53:43,317 --> 01:53:45,785
You can persuade him, Mom.

380
01:54:27,761 --> 01:54:32,027
l wonder if we love them enough

381
01:54:46,647 --> 01:54:50,378
So much that we keep from doing

382
01:55:07,801 --> 01:55:11,897
The theory is she doesn't want

383
01:56:00,788 --> 01:56:03,780
girl's school in Switzerland

384
01:56:09,263 --> 01:56:12,232
Of course she isn't.

385
01:56:27,781 --> 01:56:31,308
lt's got the best animal husbandry course

386
01:56:37,725 --> 01:56:40,421
She wants to be a rancher,

387
01:56:43,897 --> 01:56:48,596
She's just got her little schoolgirl crush

388
01:57:33,547 --> 01:57:36,675
lt seems we've hatched

389
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:52,728
He wants to be a doctor.

390
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:55,462
Over my dead body!

391
01:57:57,738 --> 01:58:01,970
He'd die for you, but he's not gonna

392
01:58:06,113 --> 01:58:10,447
He wants to go to Harvard first,

393
01:58:27,534 --> 01:58:30,298
this would mean a big sacrifice

394
01:59:52,686 --> 01:59:55,655
''...unless oil or gas shall have been struck

395

_Who's nice?

397
02:01:59,146 --> 02:02:03,242
This is a cattle ranch, not an oil field.

398
02:02:06,186 --> 02:02:09,178
That's about the most expensive

399
02:02:09,289 --> 02:02:12,417
lt'll cost you a billion dollars a year

400

Couldn't we have just one little, itty_bitty

401
02:02:34,147 --> 02:02:38,641
After reporting to President Roosevelt,

402

_Merry Christmas, Polo.

Today the wish of all of us is

_Hello, Dr. Guerra.

Don't tell me you haven't learned that

412

Could you stay and give me the lowdown

413

_Very nice to meet you.

414
02:07:47,560 --> 02:07:49,391
_Goodbye.

415
02:07:51,898 --> 02:07:55,459
_Let's get some Christmas cheer.

416
02:08:03,777 --> 02:08:07,235
Friends, we're gonna have

417
02:08:09,449 --> 02:08:12,612
l'm gonna drink a toast

418
02:08:47,720 --> 02:08:51,053
That boy is the best dang man

lt's time for you to take your place here,

They need doctors, Dad.

l never would be any good

You're the one with a responsibility

lt's Christmas morning. lsn't this

When l come home,

426
02:10:01,694 --> 02:10:05,027
l love Texas as much as you do.

427
02:10:05,965 --> 02:10:09,025
l just want to work in a different way,

428
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:58,416
lf not, it's about the only thing

429
02:11:05,558 --> 02:11:07,526
l've got some serious talk

430
02:11:15,034 --> 02:11:18,492
l've been watching you pretty close

431
02:11:55,808 --> 02:12:00,438
You could never be anything but a rancher,

432
02:12:00,780 --> 02:12:02,441
_No, sir.

433
02:12:08,087 --> 02:12:09,714
_No, sir, it's not Judy.

lt'll make you stay right here.

437
02:12:58,171 --> 02:13:01,607
But this is one thing

438
02:13:17,423 --> 02:13:20,358
When you come back

439
02:13:42,248 --> 02:13:45,684
Can you imagine you'll ever have

440
02:13:48,721 --> 02:13:53,249
Just a little place that'll allow us time

441
02:13:59,065 --> 02:14:03,502
Bob didn't mean to upset you.

442
02:14:04,604 --> 02:14:08,438
We just want something little

443
02:14:46,379 --> 02:14:49,712
l might just as well give it back

444
02:15:26,452 --> 02:15:29,285
Feel free, it's Christmas.

445
02:15:34,260 --> 02:15:38,060
l thought that was next week.

446

Christmas greetings

447
02:16:03,489 --> 02:16:07,152
l guess Christmas is as good a day as any

448

The reason l'm going

449
02:17:02,048 --> 02:17:05,381
lt seems that every time we made a deal,

450
02:17:49,662 --> 02:17:53,428
All this oil around here hasn't made

451
02:17:54,467 --> 02:17:57,436
We live pretty much like we always have

452
02:18:02,508 --> 02:18:06,672
The Lord was good to you, to set

453
02:18:22,762 --> 02:18:25,731
We'd have made improvements

454
02:18:26,532 --> 02:18:30,366
But that 27.5 percent tax exemption

455
02:18:36,208 --> 02:18:40,645
That oil tax exemption is the best thing

456
02:18:49,121 --> 02:18:52,249
One of the finest laws ever passed

457
02:18:56,062 --> 02:18:59,156
we're not adverse to accepting

458
02:19:01,067 --> 02:19:05,401
How about an exemption for depreciation

459
02:19:07,673 --> 02:19:12,167
My father's, for instance. He spent his life

460
02:19:21,053 --> 02:19:24,489
Leslie has always been a real sharp talker,

461
02:19:24,957 --> 02:19:28,791
Fair enough, Judge. You've always been

462
02:19:30,496 --> 02:19:33,897
''Do you take each other

463

02:25:20,179 --> 02:25:25,139
On behalf of the U.S. Army, l am proud

467
02:27:49,094 --> 02:27:52,086
l'm gonna fly up to Dallas,

468
02:27:52,464 --> 02:27:56,264
l'll buy myself

469
02:28:03,308 --> 02:28:05,776
you'd better hear

470
02:28:13,118 --> 02:28:17,714
He likes me. He likes my family, too.

471
02:28:22,127 --> 02:28:26,188
if l didn't know you had a level Benedict

472
02:28:35,607 --> 02:28:39,873
He's a rough rhinestone.

473
02:28:49,388 --> 02:28:51,856
You got to have $10 million

474
02:28:51,957 --> 02:28:54,755
The most important people

475
02:29:02,901 --> 02:29:05,131
lt'll be heard across the nation

476
02:29:10,008 --> 02:29:14,468
lf you people stay away, Leslie, you'll be

477
02:29:16,648 --> 02:29:20,948
You'll be putting on your pink shoes and

478
02:29:23,388 --> 02:29:28,223
We're oil rich, like the rest of them.

479
02:29:34,166 --> 02:29:36,430
lnvite everybody.

480
02:29:36,501 --> 02:29:39,834
We'll show that so_and_so

481
02:29:46,545 --> 02:29:50,140
We'll fly in low and shake the tiles

482
02:30:55,213 --> 02:30:57,738
_lsn't this something?

483
02:30:57,816 --> 02:31:00,284
Jett always tries to do things

484
02:31:04,589 --> 02:31:07,456
To some folks, he's just

485
02:31:44,329 --> 02:31:47,765
lsn't this terrific?

486
02:32:06,017 --> 02:32:09,509
My daughter, queen of Jett Rink Day!

487
02:32:14,092 --> 02:32:17,152
She's done things before l haven't

488
02:32:19,297 --> 02:32:22,460
lt's not exactly sneaky,

489
02:32:28,273 --> 02:32:32,107
But Luz is intelligent enough

490
02:32:35,914 --> 02:32:38,382
Did my daughter

491
02:32:39,117 --> 02:32:42,018
Get this. As soon as she comes in,

492
02:33:41,179 --> 02:33:44,342
Some girls might like a hotel

493
02:33:45,417 --> 02:33:48,386
Me, l like company, Jett.

494
02:33:53,658 --> 02:33:57,355
You want lots of people?

495
02:34:02,133 --> 02:34:06,433
lf there's anything you want,

496
02:34:16,481 --> 02:34:19,541
No, that's impossible.

497
02:34:20,452 --> 02:34:24,286
You know as well as l do, Cokes are taboo.

498
02:34:40,972 --> 02:34:45,466
Do you like things your way?

499
02:34:53,618 --> 02:34:56,610
And you won't either,

500
02:34:59,257 --> 02:35:02,124
and get your man

501
02:35:04,562 --> 02:35:07,895
So if l was you,

502
02:35:18,543 --> 02:35:21,376
You looked like a queen

503
02:35:41,966 --> 02:35:45,925
You could be the head lady

504
02:35:47,072 --> 02:35:50,269
if you wanted to.

505
02:35:58,683 --> 02:36:01,846
with all them thousands

506
02:36:34,185 --> 02:36:37,177
You want me to say something

507
02:36:54,339 --> 02:36:58,400
You're fascinating to me.

508
02:38:46,117 --> 02:38:49,086
l hope this storm doesn't louse up

509
02:38:49,153 --> 02:38:53,112
A slip_up, boy. l just forgot

510
02:39:13,378 --> 02:39:16,040
What's wrong with you?

511
02:39:18,316 --> 02:39:21,649
l'm Jordan Benedict,

512
02:39:24,355 --> 02:39:27,586
Mr. Rink said he'd have my neck

513
02:39:35,867 --> 02:39:39,234
You Benedicts are all close together.

514
02:39:46,044 --> 02:39:50,208
Grand opening of the Jett Rink Airport

515
02:39:50,682 --> 02:39:54,846
is the latest milestone in the dramatic

516
02:40:02,427 --> 02:40:04,657
_lt's time you got here.

517
02:40:18,242 --> 02:40:20,506
_Who's calling, please?

518
02:40:26,451 --> 02:40:29,045
Keep everybody freshened up, will you?

519
02:40:29,153 --> 02:40:32,589
We're anxious to see old Jett come out

520
02:40:35,727 --> 02:40:39,254
Why couldn't they ride with us

521
02:40:39,330 --> 02:40:42,993
Luz had to fly her own plane

522
02:41:44,729 --> 02:41:47,721
Their behavior is odd,

523
02:41:53,471 --> 02:41:56,406
l wouldn't be here unless you let them

524
02:41:56,474 --> 02:41:58,942
Now, for heaven's sake,

525
02:41:59,043 --> 02:42:03,309
Cool down, go on with your shaving, finish

526
02:42:20,098 --> 02:42:23,761
Hurry on in there.

527
02:43:53,524 --> 02:43:56,357
Stay right there, honey.

528
02:44:28,459 --> 02:44:31,451
You wanted me to go over

529
02:44:36,467 --> 02:44:39,959
l'm sorry, but it happens to be

530
02:44:44,976 --> 02:44:48,810
The young lady should have gone

531
02:45:05,263 --> 02:45:07,060
_Are you having fun?

532
02:45:07,131 --> 02:45:09,122
_How are you doing?

533
02:45:19,810 --> 02:45:23,177
lf you can spare me a moment,

534
02:45:24,782 --> 02:45:27,945
Jordan, we must hurry to be in time

535
02:45:31,722 --> 02:45:34,885
Help me round everybody up.

536
02:46:20,438 --> 02:46:24,272
We haven't changed a single comma.

537
02:46:25,276 --> 02:46:29,610
''Columbus discovered only the shell

538
02:47:20,664 --> 02:47:25,158
''You've heard of Paul Revere?''

539
02:47:25,870 --> 02:47:29,203
''Oh, yes. Ain't he the fellow

540
02:48:03,941 --> 02:48:08,378
Where we had our hair done. Jordy wants

541
02:48:08,446 --> 02:48:11,574
On account of Juana. The girl said

542
02:49:21,318 --> 02:49:23,718
What's the matter, boy?

543
02:49:23,787 --> 02:49:26,881
Get them up, Rink! Everybody knows

544
02:49:46,644 --> 02:49:50,603
You want it in front of everybody,

545
02:49:51,815 --> 02:49:55,581
l don't care much whether it's here

546
02:49:56,220 --> 02:50:00,156
so long as l get one punch

547
02:50:14,338 --> 02:50:18,672
And now, to introduce our guest of honor,

548
02:50:18,976 --> 02:50:23,640
known from the rocky coast of Maine

549
02:50:59,783 --> 02:51:02,479
You had this coming to you

550
02:52:07,718 --> 02:52:10,846
l'm going to ask you

551
02:52:10,988 --> 02:52:15,322
as l turn back the pages

552
02:52:15,793 --> 02:52:19,354
and l recall the first time

553
02:52:19,430 --> 02:52:21,864
_Where's the boy?

554
02:52:50,761 --> 02:52:55,130
afraid of neither opposition

555
02:53:22,025 --> 02:53:25,654
to the greater glory of the state

556
02:53:25,729 --> 02:53:28,892
which, in turn,

557
02:53:37,274 --> 02:53:41,870
and to the thousands of you

558
02:53:45,916 --> 02:53:51,513
l have the great honor to introduce

559
02:54:52,115 --> 02:54:56,381
Dr. Guerra set up an auxiliary hospital.

560
02:54:56,854 --> 02:55:00,255
You'll make better time

561
02:55:03,727 --> 02:55:08,562
Me, too. lf we weren't transporting

562
02:55:25,048 --> 02:55:27,778
l hope she doesn't let this

563
02:55:31,822 --> 02:55:36,225
it's just one of those things.

564
02:55:37,194 --> 02:55:40,527
Go ahead and forget it.

565
02:55:46,803 --> 02:55:50,364
We've had just about enough excitement

566
02:55:56,713 --> 02:55:59,876
You've always had a mind of your own

567
02:56:06,924 --> 02:56:10,758
You knew what you were doing

568
02:56:13,130 --> 02:56:17,089
l told you myself the morning

569
02:56:18,568 --> 02:56:22,561
l told you then that l knew

570
02:56:24,174 --> 02:56:27,701
but that marrying her was asking

571
02:56:31,515 --> 02:56:35,281
Lots of folks in these parts

572
02:56:36,653 --> 02:56:40,817
l know those people. We've run

573
02:56:43,193 --> 02:56:46,856
l'm concerned it has to do with the people

574
02:56:54,805 --> 02:56:58,639
Just the simple truth. That's you.

575
02:56:59,576 --> 02:57:04,036
l don't care about Jett Rink,

576
02:57:14,491 --> 02:57:18,154
l'm a fair man. l've been fair all my life,

577
02:57:18,962 --> 02:57:22,955
And you, my own son,

578
02:57:29,573 --> 02:57:32,804
there's ways of living,

579
02:57:32,943 --> 02:57:36,208
that folks abide by when they want

580
02:57:38,749 --> 02:57:41,912
l always say that Juana is

581
02:57:41,985 --> 02:57:44,977
Don't sit there and prove what l say!

582
02:57:49,192 --> 02:57:52,025
When that ruckus started,

583
02:57:54,664 --> 02:57:57,531
_Who took him to account? Your old man.

584
02:57:59,770 --> 02:58:00,862
_Yes!

585
02:58:04,074 --> 02:58:07,168
descendant of the long, proud line

586
02:58:07,244 --> 02:58:11,408
got knocked flat on his back

587
02:58:40,610 --> 02:58:45,206
Mom, you made a mistake when you got

588
02:58:46,716 --> 02:58:51,415
l'm shocked at you! l'm shocked

589
02:58:51,988 --> 02:58:56,254
l'll never forget the sight of my brother

590
02:58:56,326 --> 02:59:00,956
with all of our friends, disgracing us!

591
02:59:03,500 --> 02:59:05,934
lf you keep seeing Jett,

592
02:59:11,374 --> 02:59:14,866
lt seems that my family

593
02:59:21,485 --> 02:59:25,148
lf l only knew how to apologize to him,

594
02:59:34,197 --> 02:59:36,859
He passed out like a light

595
02:59:54,851 --> 02:59:57,979
The party broke up early,

596
03:00:06,963 --> 03:00:10,626
You're not going up there,

597
03:00:14,704 --> 03:00:17,696
Luz, it's not like you

598
03:00:19,176 --> 03:00:22,634
l know where he is, honey.

599
03:00:33,423 --> 03:00:36,586
l've always held a strange power

600
03:00:57,180 --> 03:01:01,014
What do you say, doll face?

601
03:01:18,668 --> 03:01:22,160
Leave him alone.

602
03:01:44,494 --> 03:01:47,486
Ladies and gentlemen

603
03:01:56,406 --> 03:02:00,069
that this great domain

604
03:02:24,834 --> 03:02:28,702
You've got to work and sweat

605
03:03:14,918 --> 03:03:19,218
Pretty Leslie.

606
03:05:34,390 --> 03:05:37,655
Juana, how does a hamburger

607
03:05:42,499 --> 03:05:45,195
Let's stop at this drive_in

608
03:06:38,955 --> 03:06:42,789
Nice place you have here. l've been

609
03:06:44,127 --> 03:06:46,687
What do you recommend?

610
03:08:05,141 --> 03:08:08,838
The plane should arrive in Benedict

611
03:08:39,742 --> 03:08:44,736
Look here, Sarge. l'd sure appreciate it

612
03:08:48,317 --> 03:08:51,480
l'm Bick Benedict.

613
03:08:55,224 --> 03:08:59,661
The name Benedict's meant something

614
03:09:22,885 --> 03:09:25,979
Go sit down,

615
03:09:26,322 --> 03:09:28,950
But this bunch's gonna eat

616
03:12:03,512 --> 03:12:06,504
ls that the best

617
03:12:11,954 --> 03:12:15,048
There's a lot of Clair de Lune

618
03:12:28,304 --> 03:12:31,762
Those kids, in their infinite wisdom,

619
03:12:32,808 --> 03:12:35,641
They know l'm a disgrace.

620
03:12:55,131 --> 03:12:59,090
Hello, Vashti. We're all fine.

621
03:13:02,138 --> 03:13:04,971
_They all made it back in one piece.

622
03:13:05,708 --> 03:13:09,200
Yes, all our guests have finally gone.

623
03:13:14,850 --> 03:13:18,809
Luz has gone on to Hollywood with Lola,

624
03:13:21,257 --> 03:13:24,590
She decided she would like to see

625
03:13:32,868 --> 03:13:37,202
All you can do is raise them.

626
03:13:46,949 --> 03:13:49,941
Jordy and Juana are gonna move

627
03:13:58,294 --> 03:14:02,628
The sun's going down over the yardarm.

628
03:14:05,601 --> 03:14:08,502
Remember, one of these days

629
03:14:15,578 --> 03:14:19,241
l'm going to stay right here.

630
03:14:20,416 --> 03:14:23,385
Roundup time is no time

631
03:14:33,262 --> 03:14:37,255
Honey, everybody's on the move.

632
03:14:39,769 --> 03:14:45,071
l wouldn't mind it too much if you wanted

633
03:14:48,944 --> 03:14:53,278
Where do you think l've been

634
03:15:01,557 --> 03:15:04,526
You really want to know

635
03:15:06,796 --> 03:15:09,629
My own grandson doesn't even look

636
03:15:25,648 --> 03:15:27,980
There's times when a man

637
03:15:46,435 --> 03:15:49,768
l just feel like my saddle's turning

638
03:16:01,617 --> 03:16:05,075
Don't ask me why.

639
03:16:06,589 --> 03:16:10,889
You know all that fine riding

640
03:16:10,960 --> 03:16:13,986
and all that glamour stuff

641
03:16:17,233 --> 03:16:20,691
But none of it ever made you

642
03:16:21,337 --> 03:16:24,670
as you were on the floor

643
03:16:31,280 --> 03:16:34,772
and landed crashing

644
03:16:44,860 --> 03:16:48,523
When we went into that place,

645
03:16:54,837 --> 03:16:58,398
Before we went in,

646
03:17:03,012 --> 03:17:06,846
''Jordan and l, and the others behind us,

647
03:17:10,953 --> 03:17:15,413
You wound up on the floor, on your back,
