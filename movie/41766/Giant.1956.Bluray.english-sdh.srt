03:15:38,852 --> 03:15:41,020
...turned out like I'd planned.

2327
03:15:42,022 --> 03:15:45,233
I just... I just feel like my saddle's...

2328
03:15:45,484 --> 03:15:47,902
...turning right out from under me.

2329
03:15:50,197 --> 03:15:52,698
Do want to know something, Jordan?

2330
03:15:54,326 --> 03:15:56,035
I think you're great.

2331
03:15:58,831 --> 03:16:03,126
Oh, don't ask me why. There are some things
that are difficult to explain.

2332
03:16:03,460 --> 03:16:07,922
You know all that fine riding you used to do,
and all that fancy roping...

2333
03:16:08,090 --> 03:16:10,800
...and all that glamour stuff you did
to dazzle me?

2334
03:16:11,051 --> 03:16:13,928
Oh, it was impressive.

2335
03:16:14,179 --> 03:16:18,057
But none of it ever made you
quite as big a man to me...

2336
03:16:18,267 --> 03:16:22,645
...as you were on the floor
of Sarge's hamburger joint.

2337
03:16:25,732 --> 03:16:29,277
When you tumbled rearward
and landed crashing...

2338
03:16:29,528 --> 03:16:32,780
...into that pile of dirty dishes...

2339
03:16:33,240 --> 03:16:36,784
...you were at last my hero.

2340
03:16:37,035 --> 03:16:39,871
That's what you always wanted to be,
you know.

2341
03:16:40,080 --> 03:16:41,122
Could be.

2342
03:16:41,915 --> 03:16:45,960
When we went into that place,
before the fight started...

2343
03:16:46,211 --> 03:16:51,340
Oh. Oh, what a fight. It was glorious.

2344
03:16:51,592 --> 03:16:53,968
Before we went into that place...

2345
03:16:54,219 --> 03:16:56,262
...I was feeling like you are now.

2346
03:16:56,513 --> 03:16:58,347
I was thinking to myself:

2347
03:16:58,599 --> 03:17:01,142
"Well, Jordan and I...

2348
03:17:01,351 --> 03:17:05,104
...and all the others behind us
have been failures."

2349
03:17:05,606 --> 03:17:07,732
And then it happened.

2350
03:17:07,983 --> 03:17:11,277
You wound up on the floor, on your back...

2351
03:17:11,528 --> 03:17:13,696
...in the middle of the salad.

2352
03:17:13,947 --> 03:17:16,157
And I said to myself:

2353
03:17:16,533 --> 03:17:21,287
"Well, after a hundred years...

2354
03:17:21,538 --> 03:17:23,372
...the Benedict family...

2355
03:17:23,624 --> 03:17:27,585
...is a real big success."

2356
03:17:28,962 --> 03:17:31,589
BICK:
You want to know something, Leslie?

2357
03:17:32,716 --> 03:17:35,843
If I live to be 90...

2358
03:17:36,595 --> 03:17:40,139
...I'm never gonna be able to figure you out.

2359
03:18:15,926 --> 03:18:17,927
