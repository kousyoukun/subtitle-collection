1
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,550
May I have your attention, please?

2
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,229
The curbside is for immediate loading
and unloading only.

3
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,118
No parking, waiting,
or stopping, until...

4
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,016
Attention, passengers...

5
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,079
They should have more personnel.
I'm going to miss my flight.

6
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,037
I'm standing here for over an hour.

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,638
Excuse me.

8
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,109
- Excuse me. I'm not in first class.
- Okay.

9
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,236
I'm on the Denver flight
that leaves in 40 minutes.

10
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,629
Could you check me in here?
I only have carry-on.

11
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,109
You're not gonna miss it.
That flight's been canceled.

12
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,351
If you go right over to customer service,
they can help you. I'm sorry.

13
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,356
I told you already.

14
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,829
Tomorrow morning is
the earliest flight I can put you on.

15
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,797
That's not good enough, okay?
I'm a surgeon.

16
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,350
I have an emergency surgery to perform
in Baltimore tomorrow, okay?

17
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,954
Look, he's 10 years old.
He's a 10-year-old boy.

18
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,793
Mark, I can come straight
from the airport if I have to.

19
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,216
Emma can meet me there
with the dress,

20
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,151
and I can just change
in the back of a cab.

21
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,833
Is my mother there?
Oh, Lord.

22
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,428
I'll be there.

23
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,395
Oh, honey.
I'll be there, okay?

24
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,039
Look, let me go,
so I can figure this out. Okay. Bye.

25
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,510
I'll fly wherever I have to tonight
to get there for tomorrow morning.

26
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,336
- Can you help me?
- I'm afraid there won't be

27
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,576
any more flights tonight because
of the storm coming through here.

28
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,336
- No, you said that.
- So, I would suggest...

29
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,936
I need to get
to Denver for the red-eye.

30
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,056
...that you get a voucher
before the hotels fill up.

31
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,640
- Right. Okay.
- Yes, hold on.

32
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,598
Yep. No, it's just me.

33
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,989
Could I get a pen? Uh-huh.

34
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,240
Yes.

35
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,951
Hold on, one second, sweetheart.

36
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,394
Sir? Sir, I'm sorry.

37
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,597
Sorry, I couldn't help hearing.
I think we may have the same problem.

38
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,736
I'm trying to get to Denver before dark,
so I can catch a red-eye to New York.

39
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,720
There's no rental cars.
I checked for rental cars.

40
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,456
He's told me that the flights
are canceled, so...

41
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,436
No, I know.
I have an idea.

42
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,079
What's your name?

43
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,719
Alex Martin.

44
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,354
Yours?

45
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,192
- Ben.
- Ah.

46
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,868
Hello?

47
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,394
- Hello? Walter.
- That's me.

48
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,959
Alex. We spoke.

49
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,632
Yeah. Hey.

50
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,188
- Yeah.
- So, what's the rush?

51
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,989
Oh. Actually, I'm getting
married tomorrow, so...

52
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,389
Can't miss that, can you?

53
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,232
Congratulations.

54
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,616
- Oh, no, no. No, we're not together.
- No, we're not getting married.

55
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,789
- We just met.
- No.

56
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,314
I got a twin on the tarmac.
Can take two.

57
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,992
$800.

58
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,960
Done.

59
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,519
Oh!

60
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,416
- Hey!
- Don't worry about him. He loves people.

61
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,668
Oh, yeah? Hey!

62
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,352
Whoa.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,719
I won't be long.
You stick with the dog.

64
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,399
He'll let you know when I'm ready.

65
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,631
Hey.

66
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,188
We should check the time
of the Denver red-eye.

67
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,319
Midnight.
Gets into JFK about quarter to six.

68
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,312
I booked us a couple of tickets.
There weren't that many left.

69
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,628
- Oh, you did?
- Yeah.

70
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,312
Thank you.

71
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,628
Filed your flight plan?

72
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,156
No need to. Still light out.
I can go VFR.

73
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,434
What about the storm?

74
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,670
- We'll beat it out.
- You sure?

75
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,955
Flew F-5s into Vietnam.

76
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,838
As long as nobody is shooting at me,
I'll get you there.

77
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,478
So, what took you to ldaho?

78
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,993
Medical conference.

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,399
You live in New York?

80
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,828
Baltimore.

81
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,432
But you're from England, right?

82
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,554
London.

83
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,358
- I married an American woman.
- Ah.

84
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,874
That there is the High Uintas Wilderness.

85
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,111
Gets over 700 inches of snow a year.

86
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,033
Million acres of pure-ass nature.

87
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,669
Easy, boy. By the way,
I was stationed near London.

88
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,797
48th Fighter Wing at Mildenhall.

89
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,279
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

90
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,356
Met the love of my life there.

91
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,159
You did? That's so romantic.

92
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,755
Where is she now?

93
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,912
Who knows? That was...
that was... fi-fi...

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,718
50 years ago.

95
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,995
Oh. What, you didn't marry her?

96
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,594
No, she was already married
to someone else.

97
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,750
- Oh!
- Anyway, I'm not the marrying kind.

98
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,711
I didn't wanna miss out on anything.

99
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,955
Oh!

100
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,678
You might wanna strap in.

101
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,159
What's that?

102
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,752
It's Candy Crush.

103
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,114
Ah.

104
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,350
I need to occupy my amygdala.

105
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,913
That's the reptile brain
that looks after...

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,116
Yeah, I know what an amygdala is.

107
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,590
What brought you to Idaho?

108
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,631
Shooting skinheads.

109
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,315
Neo-Nazis for The Guardian.

110
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,029
- A journalist?
- Uh-huh.

111
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,191
That would explain the questions.

112
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,758
Hey, buddy.

113
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,956
Hey, stay out of the food, boy.

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,036
Walter, you see that?

115
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,077
Storm must have moved.

116
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,398
Salt Lake Center.

117
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,795
Salt Lake Center, this is twin zero-niner.

118
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,997
Uh, whiskey-niner.

119
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,675
Affirmative.

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,197
Squawking zero one.

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,513
- One.
- Walter?

122
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,834
O-one.

123
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,751
Walter?

124
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,989
Shit.

125
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,229
Walter.

126
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,598
Squawking zero. Zero-two-zero.

127
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,398
- I-I don't... I-I don't...
- Walter.

128
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,096
- What's going on?
- What's wrong with your hands?

129
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,176
I think he's having a stroke.

130
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,474
Oh, my God. Is he okay?

131
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,720
I just need you to look at me, Walter.
Just look at me.

132
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,791
Shit! Oh, my God!

133
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,354
Shit!

134
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,793
Jesus Christ.
What do we do?

135
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,995
Walter? Walter?

136
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,991
Just get on the radio.
Get on the radio.

137
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,957
This is twin zero...

138
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,795
Oh, my God! Jesus Christ!

139
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,757
- Okay, Walter.
- Shit!

140
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,035
- Okay. Just grab that!
- Oh, my God!

141
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,189
Shit!

142
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,990
The dog! The dog!

143
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,230
Shit! Oh, God!

144
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,388
Put your seatbelt on.

145
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,229
- Put your hands behind your head!
- Okay!

146
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,788
Put your hands...

147
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,314
Sit back! Sit back!

148
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,633
Alex. Alex.

149
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,039
Hey! Alex.

150
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,714
Ah.

151
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
Hey.

152
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,593
Yeah, you're there.

153
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,914
Shit.

154
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,031
Oh great. You're alive.

155
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,513
Ah!

156
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,031
Hey!

157
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,793
Hello!

158
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,273
Anybody!

159
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,714
Anybody.

160
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,674
God bless you.

161
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,749
- Hey. Hi.
- Ah!

162
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,718
Hey, Alex.
Hi. Alex?

163
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,679
Hi. Hey. Okay. Alex.

164
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,597
- Mark?
- Can you look at me?

165
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,796
- Left home.
- There you go.

166
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,836
- Oh, thank God.
- Mark. Where's Mark?

167
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,831
Thank God.

168
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,239
I need my phone!

169
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,754
You want your phone.
Alex?

170
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,389
Alex, your phone's smashed.

171
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,239
My phone has no signal,
and we're pretty high up.

172
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,517
- But we're alive.
- Oh, my leg!

173
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,136
Try and sit up,
and I'll give you some water.

174
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,388
What's your name?

175
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,640
- My name?
- What's your name?

176
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,752
There you go. I'm Ben.

177
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,709
Well done.

178
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,355
What?

179
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,869
- I have some Advil in my backpack.
- Oh. Yeah.

180
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,154
Yeah, you do.

181
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,390
I found them when
I was changing your trousers.

182
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,029
Are you okay?

183
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,634
Couple of bruises, few scratches,

184
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,914
couple of cracked ribs.

185
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,319
I'm okay. I got lucky.

186
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,075
The pilot?

187
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,038
I buried him yesterday.

188
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,431
He... He didn't file a flight plan.

189
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,035
No. No, but there was radio contact.

190
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,078
How long has it been?

191
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,559
36 hours.

192
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,308
There was a thing in the manual
about a beacon.

193
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,436
Yeah, it would've been in the tail.

194
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,351
God knows where that ended up.

195
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,797
Oh, Jesus. Mark has no idea where I am.
He'll be going out of his mind.

196
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,713
Okay. Okay.

197
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,229
Someone is definitely coming to get us.

198
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,756
We've got plenty of water,
as long as we can melt the snow.

199
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,200
We've got four packets of almonds...

200
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,110
couple of candy bars...

201
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,949
a half-eaten sandwich, and some cookies.

202
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,315
That should hold us until we're rescued.

203
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,359
What kind of cookies?

204
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,235
What?

205
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,915
Joke.

206
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,311
Oh, God.

207
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,194
Plane.

208
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,034
Plane! I need the flare! Flare!
Quick!

209
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,111
- Alex, give me the flare gun.
- In here! Here!

210
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Take it!

211
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,396
No, wait, wait. It's empty!

212
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,440
- Ben!
- I need a flare.

213
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,317
Here!

214
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,396
Quick! Hurry!

215
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,393
Hey!

216
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,948
Down here! Down here!

217
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,996
- They can't hear you.
- I know!

218
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,997
It's... it's...

219
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,514
It's just what you do.

220
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,920
Okay.

221
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,353
We're down to the rule of three.

222
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,756
We can go three weeks without food,

223
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,353
three days without water...

224
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,556
- What?
- ...three minutes without air.

225
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,353
Let me help. Let me help.

226
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,670
You wanna help?
This is how you help.

227
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,034
You stay off the leg.

228
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,873
That would help you,
and it would definitely help me.

229
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,155
Please?

230
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,432
Anything that will burn.

231
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,435
Here.

232
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,749
You took these?

233
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,912
- Uh-huh.
- They're good.

234
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,630
I'm sorry you missed your wedding.

235
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,633
I can't stop thinking about him
not knowing I'm alive.

236
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,469
You told him
you were chartering a flight, right?

237
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,879
No.

238
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,916
I was gonna call him
when we got to Denver,

239
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,470
and have him be all proud of me
for figuring it out.

240
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,312
I would have got there.

241
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,639
Even if it meant rushing
down the aisle like...

242
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,756
like Dustin Hoffman in The Graduate.

243
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,318
Someone's gonna find us.

244
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
You called someone.

245
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,114
You called your wife, right?

246
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,195
No.

247
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,435
Nobody?

248
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,510
I think Dustin Hoffman was
trying to stop the wedding

249
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,919
in The Graduate.

250
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,433
What?

251
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,999
He was banging on the window.

252
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,388
"Elaine!"

253
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,109
Yeah, yeah.
I remember now.

254
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,233
Yeah. Yeah?

255
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,475
I have to pee.

256
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,198
- You have to what?
- I have to pee.

257
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,035
Need help with your trousers?

258
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,120
No.

259
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,155
Yeah.

260
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,392
Scoop your bum.

261
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,311
Thanks. Thanks.
I got it. I got it.

262
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,435
Thank you.

263
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
Okay.

264
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
Ben.

265
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,273
It looks pretty healthy.

266
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,360
Cool.

267
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,475
What are you doing?

268
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,357
It's been three days.

269
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,752
We're down to individual almonds.

270
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,712
- We should get moving.
- No.

271
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,678
- It's just best we stay here. Yeah?
- Oh God.

272
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,176
You're not gonna get far with that leg.

273
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,191
No way, Ben.
I'm not staying here. Come on.

274
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,271
I see. There's no...

275
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,032
Alex, stop!

276
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,120
Then you go.

277
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,713
- Huh?
- I can't go!

278
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,518
You wouldn't... you wouldn't...

279
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,830
You wouldn't make it without me.

280
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,876
And I'm still telling you to go.

281
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,914
How hard is it for you just to sit still?

282
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,000
Alex. Okay, okay, okay.

283
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,712
There's a ridge up there.

284
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,832
I'll hike it, climb it, and see
if I can see a road or anything, okay?

285
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,076
- Okay.
- Okay.

286
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,396
Wait, wait, wait. Take this.

287
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,871
You can use the telephoto.

288
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,632
You'll be able to see farther.

289
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,948
Hey.

290
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,073
It's okay if you don't come back.

291
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,991
What?

292
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,753
I got you into this, so...

293
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,758
I'll understand.

294
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,072
Alex, if I wanted to leave...

295
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,558
I would have left three days ago.

296
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,832
Oh, yeah.

297
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,593
Oh!

298
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,914
How do I look?

299
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,833
Stop.

300
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,353
If I can't have it...

301
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,154
you can't have it.

302
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,313
Shit.

303
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,240
Okay.

304
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,474
Let's see.

305
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,194
She's pretty.

306
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,873
Don't look at me like that.

307
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,076
Date. July 7.
Endoscopic-assisted management.

308
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,594
Hey, Ben. Surprise!

309
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,194
I can't believe you left
your little recorder unattended.

310
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,992
It's very unlike you.

311
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,392
I know you like to keep control of things.

312
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,550
Mmm, maybe that's unfair.

313
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,195
I've already said this...

314
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,192
but I wanted you to have it for good.

315
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,953
I'm happy that we've had
this time together...

316
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,032
no matter how bad things have gotten.

317
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,160
Ben?

318
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
Ben?

319
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,400
Ben?

320
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
Ben!

321
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,399
Okay, stop.
Stop, stop, stop.

322
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,196
Oh, my God!

323
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,913
Jesus Christ!
What the hell is that?

324
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,056
What is that?

325
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,354
What is that?

326
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,560
Oh, my God.

327
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
Shit!

328
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,552
No! Quiet! Quiet!

329
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,870
Stop! Stop!

330
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,875
Hey! Hey!

331
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,313
Hey, come back.
Come back.

332
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,960
Come back!

333
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,949
God, no!

334
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,429
Oh, God!

335
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,719
Oh, God.

336
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,200
Oh, God.

337
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,640
Alex?

338
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,600
Hey!

339
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,991
- What happened?
- It was a cougar.

340
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,195
Can you help him?

341
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,271
- God. Jesus.
- Oh, wow.

342
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,716
Okay. All right. Okay.

343
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,590
Easy, easy, easy.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

344
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,677
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

345
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,512
- How did he get in here?
- No, I...

346
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,079
Well, he did... he didn't get in.

347
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,435
I-I... yeah, I got the...

348
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,397
- I grabbed the flare.
- Flare?

349
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,879
- Yeah.
- Okay.

350
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,393
- This boy almost got it.
- Wait.

351
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,755
- You really shot that cougar with a flare?
- Uh-huh.

352
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,719
Did you check your phone?

353
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,628
There's nothing.

354
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,753
What's your wife's name?

355
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,229
Sarah.

356
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,519
I hope I get to meet her.

357
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,592
She must be so worried about you.

358
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,828
Oh, God.

359
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,232
Do you have kids?

360
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
No.

361
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,511
Don't eat too quickly.

362
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,397
Your stomach could cramp up.

363
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,557
You know, that was a close one.

364
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,551
That should last us for about 10 days...

365
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,995
which is great, because we're stuck here.

366
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,199
I was thinking...

367
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,236
If we could get down low enough...

368
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,256
maybe we could get enough
signal on your phone.

369
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,114
No. No, forget the phone.
There's no signal.

370
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,840
I think the search and rescue probably...

371
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,176
Well, they haven't found us yet, so...

372
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,033
I know, but they're less likely
to find us if we leave here.

373
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,776
They'll be focusing their search
on the beacon.

374
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,028
Jesus Christ, Ben.

375
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,439
No, there's a system here, Alex.

376
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,034
Yeah, systems fail all the time.

377
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,554
They haven't found us.

378
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,312
We have to get going.

379
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,037
You know, you wanted to wait.
I waited.

380
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,714
Alex, honestly,
it's too dangerous, okay?

381
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,558
I nearly fell off a cliff. Okay?

382
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,471
I honestly nearly died.

383
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,471
If we stay here, we're safe.
If we leave...

384
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,993
Look, I don't wanna die up here

385
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,877
because you're too scared
to take a risk.

386
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,598
Hey, I'm not gonna fall off a mountain

387
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,274
because you're reckless and selfish.

388
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,475
What?

389
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,714
You know what?
You're absolutely right.

390
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,518
You did get me into this.

391
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,999
I was trying to be nice.

392
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,355
- Wait a second. No.
- I was trying to help!

393
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,908
- I was trying to help you.
- No. Hold on a second.

394
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,558
You weren't trying to help me.

395
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,631
You know, I could be married by now.

396
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,880
Do you ever think about that?

397
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,656
Is that what we're talking about?
Your ceremony?

398
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,590
My God, poor Mark!

399
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,194
What about my patient?
You think about that?

400
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,872
Yeah? Do you think about my patient?

401
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,916
Don't blame me for your fucking problems,

402
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,911
'cause if it wasn't for me, you'd be dead.

403
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,075
You're the lucky one.

404
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,833
Unlike me.
I'm stuck with you.

405
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,073
I would've had a much better chance

406
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,469
if I didn't have you around, honestly.

407
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,712
Okay.

408
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,193
Let's go.

409
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,872
He's probably gonna eat you, anyway.

410
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,868
We'll find something.
Just keep walking.

411
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,393
Alex!

412
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,520
No.

413
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,035
Okay.

414
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,879
Hey.

415
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,313
Smile.

416
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,240
Don't give up.

417
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,395
Don't give up.

418
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,840
Alex!

419
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,200
Alex!

420
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,358
You could have said goodbye.

421
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,509
I had to try.

422
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,599
I had to try my way.

423
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,157
I'm just so glad I found you.

424
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,468
Me too.

425
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,720
So...

426
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,079
do we go back?

427
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,518
No, we wouldn't make it back.

428
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,753
We have to get down to the tree line.

429
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,992
- Keep moving.
- Okay.

430
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,229
Okay.

431
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,396
Tell me something.
Tell me something.

432
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,595
What?

433
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,554
Tell me about your wedding.

434
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,513
My wedding?

435
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,715
Yeah.

436
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,915
Didn't you hear?

437
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,315
I missed it.

438
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,120
Yeah.

439
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,755
No... can't talk.
You tell me something.

440
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,035
Tell me, what...

441
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,156
what kind of a doctor are you?

442
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,712
- Oh.
- Um...

443
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,913
I'm a neurosurgeon.

444
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,275
Oh, yeah? Yes.

445
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,874
Yeah. Brains. Why brains?

446
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,428
It's an intense responsibility,
you know, to...

447
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,636
cut into someone's brain.

448
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,190
It's where their perceptions are...

449
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,154
their intelligence...

450
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,149
their emotion.

451
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,713
What about the heart?

452
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,437
Huh?

453
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,715
The heart's nothing but a muscle.

454
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,554
That's it, boy.

455
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,108
We made it to the tree line.

456
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,031
Let's find shelter.

457
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,632
I think something's here.

458
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,948
This cave will work.

459
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,509
Come on.

460
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,078
Yeah. Yeah.

461
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,353
- Here.
- Ah.

462
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,440
I know.

463
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,153
Oh, jeez. It's freezing.

464
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,515
Quite a bit of swelling there.

465
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,194
- Any better?
- Yeah. That does look better.

466
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,919
- Look at that bandage.
- Yeah.

467
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,952
It's holding up actually.

468
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,313
Hey, you know what would be funny?

469
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,999
If you weren't really a doctor.

470
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,798
Why would that be funny?

471
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,476
Well, you'd just be doing all this
so you could see my fancy underwear.

472
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,552
They're not that fancy.

473
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,789
All right.

474
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,389
Thank you.

475
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,595
It's okay.

476
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,079
Where's your gloves?

477
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,878
God, Jesus.

478
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,279
Shit, you're freezing.

479
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,360
Here, come on.

480
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,349
There.

481
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,520
Better?

482
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,798
I owe you an apology.

483
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,192
I did find that beacon.

484
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,593
I saw it.

485
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,754
It was smashed to pieces.

486
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,159
No, you didn't know that
when you came looking for me, did you?

487
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,399
I think we should stay together.

488
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,235
I mean...

489
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,679
stick together.

490
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,318
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

491
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,432
It's the best chance we have at survival.

492
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,999
I know, I'm sorry.

493
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,919
Jeez, I'm sorry... for all of it.

494
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,757
I'm only telling you 'cause I don't
wanna be left on this mountain by myself.

495
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,193
Me neither.

496
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,680
You wouldn't eat me, would you, boy?

497
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,639
Alex.

498
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,959
You were talking in your sleep.

499
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,390
Yeah, I forgot to say, "I love you."

500
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,711
- Who?
- I didn't say, "I love you," to Mark...

501
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,395
- Oh.
- ...when I talked to him from the airport.

502
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,075
You know, at the end of the call,
you know, always say, "I love you."

503
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,991
He knows.

504
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,479
Of course he does.

505
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,229
Thank you.

506
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,796
I'm gonna take a look around.

507
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,952
You want coffee?

508
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,798
Well, I can't see anything now.

509
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,631
A little lower than that, I think. It's...

510
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,119
You know, it could have been anything...

511
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,795
just sunlight reflecting
off some ice, maybe.

512
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,675
Or man-made.

513
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,073
Huh?

514
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,400
We should check it out, though.

515
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:33,758
I mean, we only got
three days left of food.

516
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,920
Let me help you with that.

517
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,673
Can I ask you something?

518
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,791
How long have you been married?

519
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,589
Why would you ask me that?

520
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,075
- I'm only asking because...
- Because what?

521
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,192
Well, you wear a wedding ring, but...

522
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,590
but you don't talk about your wife.

523
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,951
Let's try to find out what that was.

524
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,797
Come on, buddy.

525
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,471
Let's try to get there
before it gets dark.

526
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,479
All right?

527
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,675
Yeah.

528
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,590
That's it. Up, up, up.

529
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,677
Good, good, good. Okay.

530
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,599
Come on, boy. Let's go.

531
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,800
I reckon we're...

532
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,716
another thousand feet down.

533
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,110
He hates his leash.
I'm gonna let him go.

534
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,953
Almost looks like he knows
where he's going.

535
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,792
I think he was safer on the leash.

536
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,160
Come on.

537
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,832
- Another hour...
- Okay, okay.

538
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,194
...then we'll stop.

539
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,032
Oh, shit.

540
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,033
No, no, no!

541
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,710
No! Damn it!

542
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,552
This is impossible!

543
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,312
We have to try and go back up, Alex.

544
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,708
Find another way around this.

545
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,190
Look, I can't go up, can I?

546
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,515
There has to be a way down.

547
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,909
No. We just gotta go back
and find another way.

548
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,877
I think if we follow this path...

549
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:57,236
Alex, we're not doing that.
We follow that path, and we... and we die.

550
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,336
The last time you thought
you knew something, we ended up...

551
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,896
What do you mean,
the last time I thought?

552
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,593
The last time I thought,
I was trusting my instincts, you know.

553
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,536
- Alex. Calm down.
- I was trusting my gut, my heart.

554
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,120
Just calm down, all right?
Let's just think about this logically.

555
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,037
- There's no actual way...
- Stop!

556
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,229
I'm scared.

557
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,192
Okay? I'm scared.

558
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,151
Admit that you're scared, too.

559
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,828
Ben...

560
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,593
do you actually know
what it means to be reckless?

561
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,591
It means to abandon safety.

562
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,496
- I know exactly what it means, Alex.
- And sometimes...

563
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,272
- But right now...
- Right now,

564
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,590
we don't have a choice, okay?

565
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:41,834
Nobody knows where we are.

566
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,150
You know, all we have is me and you.
That is it, Ben.

567
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,231
I don't want to die! Okay?

568
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,754
Tell me, Doctor, from your heart.

569
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,477
Do you a... Do you actually think
we're gonna make it?

570
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,080
No.

571
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,916
My instinct tells me
that we're gonna die up here.

572
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,759
But we do have a choice.

573
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,238
And we're still alive.

574
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,675
Here we go. There we go.

575
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,919
We're both tired.

576
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,320
Sorry.

577
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,952
Just get on with it now, yeah?

578
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,216
We just have to get on with it.

579
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,240
Yeah.

580
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:38,880
Okay.

581
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,600
We must be...

582
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,959
a couple of thousand feet downhill by now.

583
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,555
Your phone.
We should check... We should check it.

584
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,999
My phone.

585
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,829
We should just see
how much juice you have left.

586
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,718
There is no reception.

587
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,310
Haven't got much battery left.

588
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,271
You were listening to something.

589
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,279
At the airport.

590
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:30,636
Probably shouldn't...

591
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,029
Could you just, for one minute,
please just...

592
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,513
just give us one percent?

593
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,637
Just one percent of something.

594
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Are we still headed
towards the flash you saw?

595
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,799
Yeah. It's way down this way.

596
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,830
I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.

597
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,673
Just look how beautiful that is.

598
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,358
I want you to take a picture of me.

599
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,640
What?

600
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,872
I want you to take a picture of me.

601
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,313
If I'm gonna die...

602
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:10,029
I want this to be my very last picture.

603
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:12,395
- I can't.
- I want you to take it.

604
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,074
How do I look?

605
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,515
I was halfway through an assignment.

606
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,078
Um...

607
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,278
I got close to... to a group of girls.

608
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,633
Guerrilla fighters.

609
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,553
You know, they... they let me follow them.

610
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,712
There was this one girl, she...

611
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,598
she told me all about this boy she liked,

612
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,955
and, you know...

613
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,193
and I gave her my lipstick.

614
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:01,915
Then...

615
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,112
there was an explosion...

616
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,639
and she...

617
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,792
was badly injured.

618
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,793
I was there.

619
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,559
I went to help her.

620
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,517
She was still breathing then, but...

621
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,237
she was beyond hope.

622
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,793
I...

623
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,433
I went into my bag...

624
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,553
to get out my... camera.

625
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,838
She looked at me.

626
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,157
I looked at her.

627
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,270
I took her picture.

628
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,470
And then she died.

629
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,029
I can't take your picture.
I'm sorry.

630
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,238
We're not gonna die.

631
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,832
Not today.

632
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,275
Shit.

633
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,158
Where are we going?

634
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,309
We're alive.

635
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,233
That's where we're going.

636
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,197
We've been walking for three days.

637
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,840
We haven't found anything.

638
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,600
Let's hope this valley leads us there.

639
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,352
Can we stop? For a minute?

640
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,793
Yeah.

641
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:12,880
That's it.

642
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:17,875
- Jeez.
- You okay?

643
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:18,995
Okay. Yeah.

644
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,912
Just... Just put your leg up.

645
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,238
- Okay?
- Yeah.

646
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,879
How about an ice-cold drink?

647
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:33,920
Sure.

648
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,189
Thank you.

649
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,872
How about some ice with that?

650
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,594
You're funny.

651
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,910
I am getting used to the cold, though.

652
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,230
- Yeah.
- Which is weird.

653
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:49,596
Yeah, well, your body...
your body's acclimatizing.

654
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,989
It's quite ingenious, what God did.

655
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:59,039
Your body sort of figures it out.

656
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,508
Where's the dog?

657
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,398
We can't call him
'cause we don't know his name.

658
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,149
You're going to ask me to go
look for the dog, aren't you?

659
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,640
Yeah.

660
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,069
Come on, man.

661
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,799
Hey!

662
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,671
Here, boy.
What are you doing?

663
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,194
What are you eating?

664
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,678
Been holding out on us?

665
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,560
Ben?

666
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,718
Hello?

667
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,799
Nobody here?

668
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,439
Hey, Ben!

669
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:46,755
Ben!

670
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,680
Ben?

671
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,109
Alex! Alex!

672
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,037
Ah! Come on!

673
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,594
Come on!

674
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,880
Shit!

675
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,720
Come on.

676
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,640
Alex!

677
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,639
Okay.

678
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,509
I'm scared.

679
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,078
And if you don't wake up soon...

680
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,750
I think I warmed you up too fast.

681
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,392
You're severely dehydrated.

682
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:31,674
I found a syringe
of medicine for snake bites.

683
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:37,153
Emptied it out
and jerry-rigged an IV of saline fluid.

684
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,149
Now, it could go wrong, Alex.

685
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,629
Infection or something, but...

686
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,551
I think you'd want me to do this.

687
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,592
I know you would.

688
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,599
You'd tell me trust my instincts
or something.

689
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,433
- Ben.
- Alex.

690
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,633
Did we get rescued?

691
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:09,988
No.

692
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,752
No, we didn't.

693
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,793
Thank God you're back.

694
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,471
This is that cabin you saw.

695
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,350
Can you help me pee?

696
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,397
I thought you'd never ask.

697
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,510
You're gonna feel a bit dizzy.

698
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,919
Okay.

699
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,749
Okay.

700
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,799
You should have some.

701
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,432
I have.

702
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,748
Thank you.

703
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,514
Here.

704
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:38,720
So...

705
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,671
So, tell me something.

706
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:46,799
What else happened when I was away?

707
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,553
Well, you didn't miss much.

708
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,394
Snowdrifts are 10-feet deep.

709
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,040
I know, 'cause
I was nearly buried in it twice.

710
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,916
But I did find two cans of soup.

711
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,838
What happens now?

712
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,956
We just have to wait
for a break in the weather.

713
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,390
Then at least we can see
where we're going.

714
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,996
Mmm.

715
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,353
It's January.

716
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,599
How long...

717
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,114
How long can we survive
on two cans of soup?

718
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:28,795
Ben.

719
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:31,559
We've been lost almost three weeks.

720
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:33,993
Don't you wanna get home?

721
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,353
I'll find a way.

722
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,355
Hey!

723
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:57,555
Hey, Ben.

724
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:59,560
Surprise.

725
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,519
Get it, boy!

726
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,192
Grab that rabbit. Go on!

727
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,952
Go on, boy!

728
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:07,913
Where'd he go?

729
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,319
Get him!

730
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:10,435
No.

731
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,271
You got it. Come on.

732
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,119
Did you get him?
Huh? Dig!

733
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:20,079
I can't believe
you left your little recorder unattended.

734
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,998
I know you like to keep control of things.

735
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,073
Okay.

736
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,160
Come on.

737
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,071
Ah! Bullshit!

738
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,795
Okay, you tried.

739
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,096
But I wanted you to have it for good.

740
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,736
No matter how bad things have...

741
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:45,913
- I'm... I'm sorry. Umm...
- What are you doing?

742
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,115
What are you doing?

743
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,474
- I... I shouldn't have done that, Ben.
- Jesus, Alex.

744
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,456
- I'm really sorry.
- I turn my back for two minutes,

745
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,200
and you go through
all my stuff. Is that it?

746
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,955
No, that's not it. That's not it.

747
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:02,988
I just...

748
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,517
We might die together.

749
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,313
And I don't even know you.

750
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,960
You wanna get to know me? Play it.

751
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:18,989
Play it.

752
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,558
I'm happy that we've had
this time together...

753
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,711
no matter how bad things have gotten.

754
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,873
And I'm sorry that I'm leaving.

755
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,438
I'll always love you.

756
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:44,476
You just...

757
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,313
This is not something
that you can control.

758
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:48,879
Love you, bye.

759
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:01,193
I want you to know...

760
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,431
this was a really unfair way
of me trying to understand who you are.

761
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:06,788
And I'm sorry.

762
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,198
I haven't heard that message in...

763
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,159
two years.

764
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,833
I'm gonna go cut more wood.

765
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:31,270
I'm not like you, Alex.
I still can't talk about it.

766
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,396
Mmm.

767
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,397
Morning.

768
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,320
Morning.

769
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:06,600
Ben...

770
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:08,908
I've been thinking.

771
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:13,438
There has to be a road.

772
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,072
We must be close to something.

773
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,349
I'm trying...

774
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,828
to find us a way.

775
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,075
You'll make it faster if I stay here.

776
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,437
I don't wanna leave you here.

777
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,033
I might not even make it.

778
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:35,792
But you have to.

779
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,518
We can't just stay here.

780
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:49,193
Alex, my wife didn't leave me
the way you think she did.

781
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:56,753
We were married happily...

782
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,758
for eight years.

783
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,438
She got sick.

784
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:14,119
A brain tumor.

785
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,635
My wife became my patient.

786
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:27,632
And I couldn't save her.

787
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,155
She died.

788
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,717
I'm so sorry.

789
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:52,440
Alex.

790
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:55,950
You're coming with me.

791
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,473
I'm gonna get you home.

792
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:01,040
I'll slow you down.

793
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:04,157
- I can't leave. Not without you.
- What?

794
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,351
Oh!

795
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,957
I can't. I'm sorry.

796
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:47,120
We're gonna get there.

797
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,315
Alex!

798
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:25,720
Alex.

799
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:27,640
Alex.

800
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:31,995
Come on. Come on.
Please, please. Come on.

801
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,594
Come on. We're here.
We're here. We're here.

802
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:35,914
Come on, come on.

803
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,035
Alex.

804
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:51,429
Alex, do you see that?

805
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,839
- Yeah, I see.
- Alex.

806
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:55,639
I see it. I see.

807
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,553
Oh, God.

808
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:27,880
Ben?

809
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:33,960
I know.

810
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:36,388
Won't say anything.

811
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,279
I won't say anything.

812
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,473
Where's the dog?

813
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:06,196
- He'll find us. Come on.
- Yeah.

814
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,074
Come here, boy!

815
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:22,790
Walter's dog, come here!

816
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,348
Hey, buddy. Come here.
What are you doing?

817
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:27,351
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
No! Come here.

818
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:28,759
Now! Now! Here!

819
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,034
See what that is?

820
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,395
We gotta go. Let's go.
There you go.

821
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:35,391
We need to get out of here.

822
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:36,708
We're almost home.

823
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:40,830
Ben?

824
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:41,955
Alex!

825
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:45,200
Ben!

826
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:48,840
Ben?

827
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,954
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

828
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,753
- Jesus! Jesus.
- Alex.

829
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:59,308
Jesus Christ.
What... what are we gonna do?

830
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:06,876
No! No! Alex. Alex!

831
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,155
Please! No. No. Just...

832
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:11,280
Alex.

833
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,158
Ah! Alex!

834
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,440
Go get... Go get... Go get help.

835
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:22,520
Okay.

836
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:26,320
Christ.

837
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,474
Stop!

838
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,239
Stop!

839
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:13,440
Alex?

840
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,633
Alex?

841
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,716
We need a doctor in 111 immediately.

842
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:46,475
Dr. Bass?

843
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:48,960
Yeah.

844
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,520
Oh, Ben.

845
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,200
Oh, my God.

846
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:21,434
Oh, God.

847
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:26,434
We made it.

848
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,317
You... Can you believe it?

849
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,113
Yeah.

850
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:39,634
Your hands, let me see.

851
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:41,676
- Look at your hands.
- I know. I won't be...

852
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:43,512
I won't be knitting for a while.

853
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:46,834
I feel alive.

854
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:49,912
I feel alive because of you.

855
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:53,435
Yeah.

856
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:04,036
Oh. I want you to meet Mark.

857
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:06,040
You're Mark.

858
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:07,519
Yeah. Ben, right?

859
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:08,600
Yeah.

860
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:12,548
Oh, man.

861
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:14,631
Yeah. I can't begin to...

862
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:16,760
Thank you.

863
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:19,600
Yeah.

864
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:23,315
Yeah.

865
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,470
- Yeah? Okay, babe?
- Yeah. Yeah.

866
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:26,879
So, this is Ben.

867
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,512
Yeah, I know. I know.

868
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,478
Wow, it's Mark.
Good. It's good to, uh...

869
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,232
it's good to meet you.

870
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:35,958
Alex told me how you saved her life.

871
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:38,554
Yes. No.

872
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:42,068
No, you saved my life, Alex.

873
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:43,991
- Ben. Ben.
- Umm...

874
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,319
It's true.

875
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:48,560
Yeah.

876
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:03,240
Umm...

877
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:06,555
They're chasing me.
I need to go back, okay?

878
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:09,553
All right.

879
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,155
Careful. Here you go.

880
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:11,080
Come here. Come here.

881
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:12,951
Come here.

882
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:14,678
Go on.

883
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:25,318
Mrs. Qabbani, how are you?

884
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,868
Are you feeling better?
How is your arm? Let me see.

885
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:33,479
We're really serious
about this type of criminality.

886
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:36,279
Yes, but in the end, that won't matter,

887
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:40,239
for the public and businesses
when shopping online.

888
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:43,949
Retailers are highly impacted
by retail crime.

889
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:48,079
And we estimated cost to be
somewhere around 1.3 billion pounds,

890
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:50,594
which will impact everyone, including...

891
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:15,710
- Don't leave me.
- I'm not.

892
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:18,070
It's our party, you know?

893
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:19,388
I know, but, you know.

894
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:20,993
- Honey...
- I don't wanna be...

895
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:23,355
I just don't
wanna be by myself.

896
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,271
These are our friends
to welcome you.

897
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:29,310
Everybody okay?
You all have drinks? Need anything?

898
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:31,176
Could use a little ice,
actually, if you don't mind.

899
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:32,315
Oh, that's really funny.

900
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,513
Oh, Pam! Hi!
How are you?

901
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,477
- I'm fine, dear.
- Great to see you.

902
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:39,994
Look at you. You look wonderful.

903
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:42,196
- Oh, thank you.
- You know,

904
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:45,272
I don't want to pry, I don't want
to be inappropriate,

905
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:48,557
but I'm sure that you took some pictures
during your ordeal.

906
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:50,517
Oh. Umm...

907
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:52,670
This is an amazing story,

908
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:55,513
and I expect those photos
are amazing, too.

909
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,478
I really think people
would like to see them.

910
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,039
Well, I...

911
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:01,712
You know, Pam, I'm not really...

912
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,631
I'm not really ready for that.

913
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:06,109
- Will you think about it?
- Yeah, sure. Yeah.

914
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:07,679
Yeah. I'll think about it.

915
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:57,155
Hi, Ben.

916
01:33:58,160 --> 01:33:59,229
It's Alex again.

917
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:03,632
Just calling to say hi.

918
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:07,915
Try me back.

919
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:15,553
Tell you what. We'll skip out early,
you know, once the thing's over.

920
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:17,392
We can leave before the reception.

921
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:21,476
Hey.

922
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:22,560
What?

923
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:27,160
It's all right.

924
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:30,068
- Was... did you...
- Yeah, no.

925
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:32,833
I was just talking about the fund-raisers.

926
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:35,719
Oh, I'm sorry.

927
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:38,515
Sorry.

928
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:45,036
Alex, I...

929
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:47,839
I get that you haven't wanted
to talk about this...

930
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:53,996
but... I... I know
what I'm in with you.

931
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:57,799
I always told myself I'd...

932
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:00,912
I'd get some call from somewhere.

933
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:05,831
So, I made a deal with myself.

934
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:14,109
That I would always love you,

935
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:16,714
even if you came home missing
a piece of yourself.

936
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,319
Hello?

937
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:59,710
Hi. I'm sorry I'm later than I...

938
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:01,358
You look brand-new.

939
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,078
- Oh, so... so do you.
- How are you?

940
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:04,195
Yeah. Good.

941
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:06,840
Sit down.

942
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:12,232
Can I get you something to drink?

943
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:14,470
Oh, no.
Just water's fine, thanks.

944
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:18,988
So, how are you?

945
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:23,120
How's your leg?

946
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:25,469
How's yours?

947
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:27,198
Yeah.

948
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:29,840
I can't run, but I get by.

949
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,000
I kept the dog.

950
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,439
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

951
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:35,714
So what'd you call him?

952
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:37,756
Umm... dog.

953
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:39,512
- He still...
- No.

954
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:40,874
He still doesn't have a name.

955
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:45,919
You look... You look...

956
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:47,871
You look beautiful, Alex.

957
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:50,389
Thank you.

958
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:53,355
How is everything?

959
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:54,589
Umm, good.

960
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:57,831
I'm working with people more.

961
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:02,478
Post-trauma patients,
you know, the extreme cases.

962
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:04,830
I sort of float between a NHS clinic

963
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:08,833
and a rehabilitation center
in South London, where I live now.

964
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:11,275
- It's good to be home.
- No more surgery?

965
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:14,198
No. No, I can't do that anymore.

966
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:21,400
And you? How are you?

967
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:22,959
I'm okay, too. Yeah.

968
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:25,600
I... I came home and...

969
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:29,555
everything had shifted, but...

970
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:31,676
I kind of had to wait it out,
but it's okay.

971
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,592
No more conflict zones.

972
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:39,357
And the last thing
I feel like doing is getting on a plane.

973
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:44,117
So I'm teaching now, part-time,

974
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:46,077
staying closer to home.

975
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:47,673
Yeah.

976
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,518
How was it?
How was the wedding?

977
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:52,755
Oh. We didn't have one.

978
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:55,400
What?

979
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:58,674
What? You didn't...

980
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,320
No.

981
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:07,388
I couldn't.

982
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:11,628
Mark is a really wonderful man, but...

983
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,108
but I...

984
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:18,908
I couldn't.

985
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:23,516
I'm really sorry, Alex. That's...

986
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:28,272
Why didn't you tell me?

987
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:32,520
You're not that great
at picking up the phone.

988
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:33,953
Are you guys hungry?

989
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:35,075
- No.
- No.

990
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:53,709
I didn't pick up my phone
'cause I thought you were married, Alex.

991
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:55,358
I thought you were married.

992
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,158
You could have called back.

993
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:05,198
It was hard enough
for me to lose Sarah.

994
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:11,391
I struggled with the idea
of losing you, too.

995
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,560
And then when you sent
those photographs...

996
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:18,916
I, uh... I felt alive.

997
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,433
I really did. I...

998
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,754
We made it, you and I.

999
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:28,874
And I had to see you.

1000
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:33,070
I loved you on that mountain.

1001
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,391
I tried to pretend that I didn't,
but I did.

1002
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:43,794
I came home and nothing was the same.

1003
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,035
And then I tried to reach you, and it...

1004
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:50,559
it was so...

1005
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:54,958
It was just too painful.

1006
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:57,673
So I had to...

1007
01:42:58,640 --> 01:43:00,517
make myself accept

1008
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:04,309
that maybe it wasn't real,
and it would never work,

1009
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:05,913
not in real life.

1010
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:10,398
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

1011
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:18,311
There's a moment for these things,
and then it... it passes.

1012
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:34,709
Hey, so...

1013
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:39,474
Could you... Could you give
the dog a name?

1014
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:42,033
He kind of deserves it.

1015
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:46,519
I think you're wrong, Alex.

1016
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:50,356
I think we survived
because we fell in love.

1017
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:56,193
Up there it was just...
it was just me and you.

1018
01:43:58,400 --> 01:43:59,799
The world is bigger than that.

1019
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:04,397
And the heart is just a muscle.

1020
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:06,680
Right?

1021
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,473
What idiot said that?
