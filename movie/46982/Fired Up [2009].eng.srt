1
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:35,858
Did you feel that too?

2
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,731
- What?
- Your stomach.

3
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:38,962
It's like butterflies.

4
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:42,506
My mom said when I met
the right girl, I'd feel butterflies.

5
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:43,699
I think I'm ready.

6
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:47,938
Can you believe him?

7
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:49,877
He falls so easily.

8
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,449
I'm a little more guarded.

9
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:55,382
I guess it's because
I've been hurt before.

10
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:57,988
I'll never hurt you.

11
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,962
- My dad.
- My dad.

12
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,858
- You guys are sisters?
- Our dads are friends.

13
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:10,002
They went to the gym.
They're muscle-heads.

14
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,162
Your best bet is to curl into a ball
until they stop beating you.

15
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:16,467
I'm telling you this
because I think I might love you.

16
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:23,406
What's our play?

17
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,746
Run for the window. I'll get
the car keys. Y formation, dog-leg left.

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,751
- Ready, break.
- Break.

19
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:51,833
We should wait
two days before we call them.

20
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,173
You've gotta be kidding me.

21
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,911
Do you think they have any concept
of how fast a car can go?

22
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,925
Reverse kitty cat, dog-leg left,
over the fence, on my count, break.

23
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,619
- Hey, I'm Nick.
- Shawn. Can we use your pool?

24
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,766
Come on, Tigers. Yeah!

25
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,341
Split Johnny left!
Split Johnny left!

26
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:01,579
Come on! Come on, guys!
Set. Hike.

27
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,795
Yeah! Yeah! All day. All day.
Candy from a baby.

28
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,958
- What do you wanna do?
- That brunette.

29
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,897
Looks like she wouldn't mind
St. Nick stuffed down her chimney.

30
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,559
No, I mean, the play, in the game.

31
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:27,297
- Come on, guys, focus.
- I've never been more focused.

32
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,737
Check it, couple of meatloaves
in that baby tee.

33
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,501
Not mad at that belly ring either.

34
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,977
Have you seen this blond?
Rackety-rack, don't talk back.

35
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,809
Wonder if her carpet
matches my drapes.

36
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,848
Delay of game, loss of five yards.

37
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,248
And just because
it's a spring scrimmage...

38
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,981
...doesn't mean you can
shit yourselves out here. Go!

39
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,886
- Sorry, coach.
- Go, go, go. Come on, go, go.

40
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,958
Tigers!

41
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,096
<i>Come on, crowd
Let's hear some noise</i>

42
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,459
<i>N- O-I-S-E
Noise</i>

43
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,294
God. See, look, we took too long.

44
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,663
Here come
the whack-ass cheerleaders, man.

45
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:01,295
<i>Noise, N-O-I-S-E
Noise</i>

46
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,498
Tigers.

47
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,679
- Well, I am pumped up.
- All right, what's the play?

48
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,980
Hold on,
baby tee is signing me her number.

49
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:19,852
- Is that a seven? A five and a two?
- Any day now, shit buckets.

50
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,927
I don't wanna run laps all afternoon.
I have a shrink appointment.

51
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,758
Dude, your cousin stuck his finger
in your ass. Get over it.

52
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,329
They playing us loose. Let's
get short passes and extra yardage.

53
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:33,233
The hell with that, man.
You either bet big or go home.

54
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,640
- You gotta risk it to get the biscuit.
- Aye, my brother.

55
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:40,677
All right. Pro-zoom trips, deep route,
slant slim boogie on my count. Ready?

56
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,337
Break.

57
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,711
54s and Mike, watch that blitz.

58
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:48,150
Blue 17, set, hut.

59
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,323
Come on, Shawn.

60
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,290
Come on, baby. Yeah!

61
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,474
- Hey, I'm Nick.
- Shawn.

62
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,719
- Hey, Shawn.
- Hey, Maddy.

63
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:28,019
Thanks for helping me study Bio.
I'm retarded about reverse osmosis.

64
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:29,218
No, you're not.

65
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,897
Pressure forcing a solvent
through a membrane...

66
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:35,000
...like when a water balloon
gets too big and then explodes.

67
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,797
Got it. Thanks. You're so awesome.

68
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,632
No. Science is awesome.

69
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,873
And you're awesome.
Now, go crush that test.

70
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:46,011
- Thanks.
- High five.

71
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,170
Nick. Hey, Nick.

72
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,316
- Name, name. I need a name.
- Jennifer.

73
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,179
- Jennifer, hi, how are you?
- I'm great. Really great.

74
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,887
- Are you going to the bonfire tonight?
- You know it.

75
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,647
I was just saying to Shawn here...

76
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,759
...I cannot wait to go to the bonfire
so I can hang out with...

77
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,386
- Jennifer.
- Jennifer.

78
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,689
- I'll see you tonight.
- Okay, Jennifer.

79
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:13,127
- It's not that hard a name to remember.
- I went out with her last semester.

80
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,536
The name gets erased
to make room for new ones.

81
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:19,303
- There's like 3000 kids at this school.
- Can't you just remember more names?

82
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,310
I don't know how it works.
Talk to Tech Support.

83
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,676
- There are my guys.
- Let's bet how many times...

84
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,080
- ... he says "shit. " I say seven.
- No way, 10.

85
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,480
- Hey, coach.
- Hey, coach.

86
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,143
Shitheads think you're the shit?

87
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,449
That you don't need
to pay attention out there?

88
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:35,060
I'll kick the shit out of you.
You pumped for football camp?

89
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,219
- I guess so.
- Yeah, two weeks without girls.

90
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,957
- Who wouldn't be pumped?
- Don't mess with me, shit-dick.

91
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:43,094
I am gonna push you like you've
never been pushed before.

92
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,328
Your muscles will ache,
your head will throb.

93
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,996
You'll shit blood out of holes
you never knew you had.

94
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,535
At least we're gonna
be in Daytona Beach.

95
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,771
No. Change it up this year.
Camp's gonna be in El Paso, Texas.

96
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,778
Hotter than your shithole.

97
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,008
We're gonna get
you shits conditioned.

98
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:02,154
Bus leaves Monday
at 0-shit-hundred hours.

99
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,414
- Which is?
-4:45 a. m.

100
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,023
- Of course.
- The usual.

101
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,956
Skip your morning shit
and get down here.

102
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,221
Ten "shits," you win.
How do you always know?

103
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,197
It's a gift. I'm not proud of it.

104
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,427
Bye.

105
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,066
Maybe I'll see you
sometime this summer.

106
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,840
Don't be obvious.
He knows you like him.

107
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,842
You guys coming
to my dad's after camp?

108
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,174
- Hells, yeah. He gave it to you again?
- Nice.

109
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,339
He figures if he lets
me have it one week...

110
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:34,145
...I'll forgive him for not being there
when I need him.

111
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,550
And guess what. He's right.

112
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:40,557
Did you hear football camp's gonna
be in El Paso? How cool is that?

113
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:43,217
We gonna be sweating, hallucinating,
our skin burning.

114
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,864
Like being on shrooms,
but without girls to yell at us.

115
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:50,662
"Where's the car? Where's the car?
I'm getting scared. Hold my purse. "

116
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,871
- Two weeks, Shawn. Two weeks.
- I know.

117
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,035
Two weeks out of the best
years of our lives.

118
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,612
Two weeks we're never
gonna get back, like, ever.

119
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,146
I know.

120
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,080
So are you guys psyched
for cheer camp or what?

121
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,685
It's, like, all I think about.

122
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,948
Know how Martin Luther King
had a dream? Well, I do too.

123
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:15,423
To kick ass at cheer camp. And if
that makes me shallow, then fine.

124
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:19,395
- Call me and Dr. King shallow.
- That doesn't make you shallow.

125
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,495
That makes you real.

126
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,102
We have got to do better
than last year.

127
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,967
We could take a dump in our pants
and still do better than last year.

128
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,540
- I'm just saying.
- But we're better this year.

129
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,770
And if we work hard,
I think we have a real shot.

130
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:36,141
I don't know.
There's 300 girls up there...

131
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,306
...who want it just as much
as we do.

132
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:41,078
- And who are much better than us.
- Three hundred girls.

133
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,052
Who want it just as much as we do.

134
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,986
And are much better than us.

135
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,724
Tell you what, man,
that'd be the place to be.

136
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:53,229
Instead of sweating our balls off
in the desert with Coach Shit-Shit.

137
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,561
- So let's go.
- What?

138
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,568
Let's go to cheer camp,
be cheerleaders.

139
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,366
- Cheerleaders?
- Yes.

140
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,566
Oh, my God.
Are you coming out to me?

141
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,370
I'm so proud of you, man.

142
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,843
And you know what,
I kind of always knew.

143
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,574
Will you shut up. All right,
I'm too straight to be gay.

144
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,650
I could suck knob
and still be straight.

145
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:15,082
I could have one in my mouth
and two in each hand...

146
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,654
- ... and still win a straight award.
- All right.

147
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,451
Which is why I wanna go
to cheer camp. Think.

148
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,857
Three hundred hotties
we've never been with before.

149
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,225
I wonder if they let guys
go to cheer camp.

150
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,591
Name, name. Give me a name.

151
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,633
- Carly. She's the captain.
- Hey, Carly.

152
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:34,364
Yeah, I know, it's the most beautiful
name you've ever heard...

153
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,166
...my eyes look like forever...

154
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,470
...and you love every bone in my body,
especially yours.

155
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,545
No, but that's good.
Mind if I use it?

156
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:42,942
No, no. No lines.

157
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,049
We wanted to wish you
luck at cheer camp.

158
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:48,482
Sure, you do. I know your game.
No girl left unturned.

159
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,320
- What?
- How dare you?

160
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:53,049
No. We just see how hard
you ladies cheer out there...

161
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,090
...and we really hope
that you do good.

162
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:59,254
Yeah, do us proud, you know. Beat
the skirts off those 300 other girls.

163
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,458
And guys? Are there guys there?
Do guys go?

164
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,933
- What about guys?
- It's a good question.

165
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,629
There's girls and guys that go.
I don't know if guys-

166
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,741
Yes. The good teams are all co-ed.

167
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:13,309
That's interesting. I just didn't
know that. I was just pondering.

168
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,778
Carly, come here. We're working on
a new mount Bianca came up with.

169
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,974
- Yeah!
- Coming.

170
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:23,149
I'm gonna walk away backwards,
so you guys don't talk about my ass.

171
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:26,155
Man, she's got nice lumps.
Either one of us ever hit that?

172
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,987
I don't think so. I think
she respects herself too much.

173
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,287
Right.

174
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,226
Who wants to deal with that drama?

175
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,229
So, what do you think
about cheer camp?

176
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,596
- What do you mean, what do I think?
- Let's go.

177
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,637
- We're not cheerleaders.
- We're athletes, we can do anything.

178
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,741
They don't just let anybody go.
You've gotta be part of a squad.

179
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,774
Let's join a squad.
How hard can this be?

180
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,708
A couple of flips, a pyramid.

181
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,040
<i>Black sheep</i>

182
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,944
Three hundred honeys
on our biscuits.

183
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:54,086
- What about football camp?
- Screw football.

184
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:57,120
The only reason we started playing
was to pull chicks.

185
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,656
You can't honestly tell me you enjoy
running in blazing hot pads...

186
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,193
...trying to catch a pass two seconds
before some 2000-pound mongoloid...

187
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:07,594
- ... crashes into your Nutter Butters.
- El Paso, here we come.

188
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,133
Not if it comes to us first!

189
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,527
Oh, shit.

190
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,137
- I'm on fire.
- Mookie!

191
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:17,332
- Water, water, water.
- I'll put you out.

192
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,943
I'm a hero.

193
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,944
Screw football. Let's go cheer.

194
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,177
Shawny Shawn!

195
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,742
We need to convince
the squad they need us.

196
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,218
- Not gonna be easy.
- That's why we go to Poppy.

197
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,380
- I wish there was another way.
- There's not.

198
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,958
- But I wish there was.
- But there's not. We're here.

199
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,595
- I wish we weren't.
- But we are.

200
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,061
Hi, sis.

201
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,064
Why am I looking at you? Speak.

202
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:45,499
Poppy, you're getting so big now.
How old are you?

203
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,231
I'm 60. Can we get past
the small talk?

204
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,968
The only time you come to see me
is when you need something.

205
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,736
What? Tug mags?

206
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,710
Mike's Hard Lemonade?

207
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,448
- Another ride to the clinic?
- Poppy.

208
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,983
No. We wanna go to that
cheerleading camp you're going to.

209
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:07,489
Since you're killing on the JV squad
and so advanced beyond your years...

210
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,321
...we thought you'd get us
up to speed.

211
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,520
Hey, buddy,
you can piss on my face...

212
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,221
...just don't tell me it's raining.

213
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,000
You guys have been through
every girl at your school...

214
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,228
...and you're looking
for fresh muff.

215
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,930
Some itchy-itchy-nah-nah.
Wall-to-wall carpet.

216
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,167
Okay, seriously, how old are you?

217
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,506
Tell you what, I'll teach you
some basic cheerleader moves.

218
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,841
High V's, low V's,
touchdown, baskets.

219
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,984
Don't the guys just throw
the girls up and then catch them?

220
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:36,747
Pretty much. But I'll let you practice
on me and tell you what they're called.

221
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,981
In exchange, I get Shawn's room.

222
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,284
- No.
- Done.

223
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,858
Those are my terms.

224
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,188
- We'll take them.
- Dude, I've got my own bathroom.

225
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,297
Dude, after cheer camp, you won't
even need your own bathroom.

226
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,092
What? What does that even mean?

227
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,964
Poppy, you got yourself a deal.
Teach us, we go see Carly.

228
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,072
- Wrong, Gossip Girl.
- What?

229
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,141
Carly's not one of your humpety-hump
football groupies.

230
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:00,403
She's too smart to buy that you guys
wanna be cheerleaders.

231
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:01,944
Okay, so, what's the play?

232
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,588
- Here she comes, here she comes.
- Go, go. Get up there.

233
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,490
Oh, rats.

234
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,322
- We got our Frisbee stuck.
- How are we gonna get it down?

235
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,555
- Go space shuttle.
- That's what I'm thinking.

236
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:20,993
Good idea.

237
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,032
- Ready?
- Okay.

238
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:29,107
<i>One, two, three, four, five, six
Seven, grab, drop, catch</i>

239
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,869
- Great job.
- Go, buddy.

240
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:34,910
Do they always get
so excited like that?

241
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,640
Haven't you ever seen them
do their touchdown dances?

242
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,947
I mean, they flip all over the place.
You'd think they were cheerleaders.

243
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,089
- No.
- You guys really like cheering?

244
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,224
That wasn't cheering,
just goofing around.

245
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,360
You nailed a backward sponge
and go cradle.

246
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,087
No. We threw my sister up in the air
to get our Frisbee.

247
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,356
It was either that
or we get three ladders.

248
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:54,556
Come on, guys.

249
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:59,170
You love cheering. Don't run from it.
This is a safe place.

250
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,199
We kind of do. It's so much
more athletic than football.

251
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,469
If it were up to us, we'd go
with you ladies to cheer camp.

252
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,408
But we're football meatheads.

253
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,106
We gotta march in lockstep
to what society expects.

254
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,877
Don't tell anyone, okay?
Totally ruin our rep.

255
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,044
- We'll catch you later.
- Have a good summer.

256
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,213
We're gonna go watch
a Bears' game on TV.

257
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,483
<i>Go, Bears</i>

258
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:35,329
I'm supposed to believe
the biggest jocks in school...

259
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,668
...all along really wanted
to be cheerleaders?

260
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:41,040
Don't get caught up in the lockstep
of society's expectations.

261
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,147
They tossed Poppy
like 20 feet in the air.

262
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,613
Look, Carly,
we don't have any muscle.

263
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:49,345
If you really wanna do better this year,
they're our only hope.

264
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,789
Unless you guys wanna try steroids,
which I'm totally open to.

265
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:57,059
- I'm just saying.
- I don't care. I don't trust those guys.

266
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,593
They're not coming. I'm the captain.

267
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:02,563
Miss Klingerhoff is the coach.
Let's see what she thinks.

268
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:08,038
What a fantastic idea.

269
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:12,474
It's exactly what this squad needs
to just push it over the top.

270
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,113
But Miss Klingerhoff,
they have never done it before.

271
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:20,241
They don't know any of our cheers,
and, come on, it's Nick and Shawn.

272
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,387
Don't judge a book
by its cover, Carly.

273
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,957
You never really know what a book
is about until you get to page 50.

274
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,991
Fifty?

275
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:32,790
- Wouldn't guess a page over 40.
- More like 35.

276
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:34,990
My chickens.

277
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,532
You come here, you.

278
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,140
All right. One down, one to go.

279
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,508
What are we gonna say to Coach
Shit-For-Words to get out of football?

280
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,673
What every kid says to get out
of everything he doesn't wanna do.

281
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,714
So not only do I find out yesterday
I'm adopted...

282
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,881
...the people I've called mom and
dad are infertile imposters...

283
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:03,153
...who bought me outside a meth clinic
for two boxes of Sudafed...

284
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,661
...but I also get
this news dropped on me:

285
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,523
My birth father, Bruce...

286
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:12,068
...well, he needs a kidney
and I'm the only match.

287
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,330
And apparently Bruce needs it stat.

288
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,475
You need it stat, Bruce? Huh?

289
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,406
I needed a father stat
instead of the stay-at-home dad...

290
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,912
...who showers me with love every
day, this goddamn spermless liar!

291
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,343
So now I gotta be at Kaiser
Permanente tomorrow at 6 a. m.

292
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,955
I know. Bruce couldn't even afford
a real hospital.

293
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,785
Managed care. It's ironic, huh?

294
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,123
Never managed to care for me.

295
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,196
You shitting me?

296
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,458
Are you saying you can't go to camp?

297
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,863
Yeah, but don't make me say it,
coach.

298
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:48,405
Because it's eating me up inside.
It's eating me up.

299
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,841
Shit!

300
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,046
- Cheer camp! Cheer camp!
- One, two.

301
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,280
- Cheer camp! Cheer camp!
- One, two.

302
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,040
Cheer camp! One, two.

303
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,444
You might have everyone else fooled,
but not me.

304
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:04,182
Well, if being a fool
for cheering is wrong...

305
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,548
...then I don't wanna be right.

306
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,193
You might wanna dial back
your bullshit with her.

307
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,658
She seems pretty with-it.

308
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,024
That's a great note. Thanks.

309
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,235
We're so psyched you're here.

310
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,464
- Yeah, us too. Oh, yeah.
- Me too, yeah, yeah.

311
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,799
Don't worry about Carly.

312
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,000
- She's really into cheering.
- No worries.

313
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,509
<i>We are driving
We, we are driving</i>

314
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:31,278
<i>We are driving
We, we are driving</i>

315
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,351
<i>We like driving
We, we like driving</i>

316
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:38,189
<i>We like driving
We, we like driving</i>

317
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:41,520
<i>- We are eating
- We, we are eating</i>

318
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,094
<i>We are driving again
We are driving</i>

319
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:48,028
<i>We are driving again
We are driving</i>

320
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,260
- How long does this go on for?
- The whole way.

321
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:55,032
Just wait till their cycles match up.
You'll miss these days.

322
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,105
We're gonna miss
Mookie's dad's house.

323
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,870
Oh, buddy, we are not missing
Mookie's dad's house.

324
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,842
Yeah.
This thing is three weeks long.

325
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:06,110
Not for us, it isn't. We hook up
like maniacs, we bail in two.

326
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,621
That's probably gonna piss
some people off.

327
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,847
To make an omelet,
you gotta break some eggs.

328
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:15,323
Grated cheese, slice some mushrooms,
salt, pepper, don't over-beat.

329
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,485
<i>We are driving again
We are driving</i>

330
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,494
<i>We are driving again
We are driving</i>

331
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,794
<i>We are driving again
We are driving</i>

332
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:25,095
Sorry.

333
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,229
I should say so, handsy.
At least buy me dinner first.

334
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:30,932
Very funny.

335
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,373
All right, now you're just
taking advantage of me.

336
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:42,849
<i>We are here
We, we are here</i>

337
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,489
I think we made a big mistake.

338
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,683
We may have screwed the pooch
on this one.

339
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,996
Or maybe the pooch
is gonna screw us.

340
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,689
Sweet Mary in a D-cup.

341
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,207
I think our bus crashed
and we're in heaven.

342
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,478
No. We would've heard:

343
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:47,346
<i>"We are crashing
We, we are crashing"</i>

344
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:50,483
Let's go see how warm the water is.

345
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,318
- Hi. Do I know you?
- I don't think so.

346
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:56,984
Well, I'm Nick. I'm new this year.
Maybe you could show me around.

347
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,562
- Who's this?
- Nick. He's new this year.

348
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,959
This is Shawn, also new,
needs showing around.

349
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,568
- If it's not too much trouble.
- You gotta check in.

350
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:05,828
Okay, coming.

351
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,564
It was very nice meeting you.
Hope we see you around.

352
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,176
I'll put a bookmark between you.
That way we know where we left off.

353
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,077
Hi. What squad are you on?

354
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:27,154
<i>Diora. I believe that's Italiano
for "beautiful princess. "</i>

355
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,586
- No.
- Well, it should be.

356
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,490
- I'm calling the dictionary people.
- What squad are you on?

357
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,130
The Tigers, Gerald R. Ford High.

358
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:36,062
Below-average president,
above-average student body.

359
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,430
So, what are you doing later?

360
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,037
Not you.

361
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,367
What about accents?
You like Aussies?

362
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,940
You wanna wear my leather hat?

363
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:48,476
Mascots, I'll be checking you in
in 10 minutes at the mascot table.

364
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,283
- Why are you still here?
- You like canopy beds?

365
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,848
The last bus from Bitchville
just pulled in.

366
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,826
- Who's that?
- The Panthers.

367
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:06,055
They always come in first
and they don't let anyone forget it.

368
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,534
You guys came back.
I think that's so brave.

369
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,238
I just hope one day
there's a special cheer camp...

370
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,238
...where squads like yours
really have a shot.

371
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,467
- Shut up.
- Truth hurts.

372
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,136
- Your face is gonna hurt.
- Does your face hurt...

373
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:25,613
- ... when you stuff it with pie?
- You wish you had my body image.

374
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,753
I'm healthy. Unlike you, Skeletor.

375
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:31,154
We're a different team this year,
Gwyneth.

376
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,917
Meet our new squad members.

377
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,389
I'm Nick. This is Shawn.

378
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,084
Hi. Great to meet you.

379
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:41,989
So you got a little sausage
in your soup this year. BFD.

380
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:45,332
- See you on the cheer field.
- It's that big chunk of grass...

381
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,131
...you come in last on, every year.

382
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,103
Panthers out.

383
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,248
Panthers out?

384
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,976
What are they, a knife gang?

385
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:03,916
- God, I hate them.
- I think they're kind of cool.

386
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,815
I'm just saying.

387
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,935
Hey. I'm Nick. This is Shawn.

388
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:20,935
I'm Brewster.

389
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,165
Not my real name.

390
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,969
My parents named me Jack.

391
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:29,637
Jack, so strong, so masculine.
We get it. You wanted a boy.

392
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:33,581
My name's Jack. I punch bad guys,
and I kiss girls.

393
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,652
- Save it.
- Okay.

394
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:40,258
<i>Now, just a quick FY información,
I'm kind of a neat freak...</i>

395
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:45,453
...so we'll get along great if you
just keep your area clean.

396
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,756
And by "area," you mean?

397
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,900
- Your bunks.
- Okay.

398
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,433
I can't stand clutter.
That's why we left Calcutta.

399
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:54,436
Well, that and my dad
took a job with United Airlines.

400
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:57,040
Your jobs aren't just
going over there, sailor.

401
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:01,111
Some of us are coming over here.
The world is flat like a son of a bitch.

402
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,577
You're giving us a lot to process here.

403
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,015
Hey, what's up, guys? I'm Adam.

404
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:09,449
What's up, man?
Hey, I'm Nick. This is Shawn.

405
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,480
Well, welcome, welcome.

406
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:14,147
- Is that your girlfriend?
- Yeah.

407
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:17,455
That's Jody. We've been cheering
together since we were 5.

408
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,892
So you take this seriously?

409
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:23,501
I wanna be the first in my family to
go to college on a cheer scholarship.

410
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:26,034
Good luck, man.
I hope you break the cycle.

411
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:27,364
- Thanks, man.
- Cool.

412
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:28,563
What's up, Eagle?

413
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,409
Mascots don't talk. They just gesture.

414
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,603
- Even in their bunks?
- The whole time, baby girl.

415
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,713
It's total immersion.

416
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,908
Hey. Can someone
help me with my stuff?

417
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:43,417
I got a huge bag of footballs,
beer, Xbox games.

418
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,919
Let's get this party started.

419
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:47,523
Finally, a kindred spirit.
I'm Nick. This is Shawn.

420
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,717
- I'm Downey.
- What's up? Nice to meet you.

421
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:53,023
Downey. Downey. All right,
so break it down for us.

422
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,098
How great is this place?

423
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,599
- It's sick, dude.
- Sweet. Right there.

424
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:01,102
The coaches are amazing. Your
cheering's gonna be off the charts.

425
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,333
My cheering's gonna be off the charts.
I guess that's a good thing.

426
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,773
What about the ladies?
Tell me about the ladies.

427
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,072
Oh, yeah, totally.

428
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,449
Their cheering gets better too.
They see real progress.

429
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,111
What the...?

430
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:22,886
Wow, look at them all, dude. In rows.
It's like the hot-chick produce aisle.

431
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,459
I don't know where to start.

432
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,257
Do we go from tall to short
or blond to redhead?

433
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:29,457
Maybe just iPod-shuffle mode.

434
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,899
This is why I'd never wanna
be president. Too many decisions.

435
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:35,232
Don't worry,
I don't think that's in the cards.

436
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:39,400
You say that now, but George W.
was a cheerleader at Yale.

437
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,273
He never thought
he'd be president...

438
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:44,745
...snorting coke through his skull and
bones at a New Haven titty bar.

439
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,577
You just never know, Shawnzy.

440
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:50,187
And that is what makes America great.
Any idiot can be president.

441
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:53,324
- Let's hear some noise over here!
- Noise over here!

442
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,017
- Let's hear some noise over here!
- Noise over here!

443
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,594
- Are you fired up?
- We're fired up!

444
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:01,061
- Are you fired up?
- We're fired up!

445
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,064
- How do you spell "fired up"?
- F-U!

446
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:04,566
Not really.

447
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,863
- How do you spell "fired up"?
- F-U!

448
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:08,972
- What's that spell?
- Fired up!

449
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,698
- Not really that way either.
- Nope.

450
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:14,209
Damn straight. F-U.
You're at university now.

451
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,108
- Fired Up University.
- This is awesome.

452
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:19,579
Cheer college, my friends. None
of this high school stuff for you.

453
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:23,585
You got three weeks. We're gonna
take it right to the top to F-U.

454
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:25,882
- F-U!
- F-U!

455
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:31,324
Howdy do? My name is Coach Keith.
I'm the skipper of this spirit ship.

456
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:35,125
As many of you know, I was
the very first male cheerleader ever...

457
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,268
...to compete at the Nationals.

458
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,335
I was born cheering.

459
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:42,064
My mother swears
the first thing out of her what's-it...

460
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,970
...was a little pair of baby hands
doing spirit fingers.

461
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,339
That's a joke, but it really happened.

462
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,384
It is now my absolute pleasure...

463
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,611
...to introduce to you
your head counselor...

464
00:25:55,787 --> 00:26:00,224
...and my super-sexy handsome wife,
Diora. Let's bring her out here.

465
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:07,829
- What? Did he say wife?
- No, he couldn't have.

466
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,023
Welcome, everyone.

467
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,761
For the next three weeks, you'll train
with me and the other coaches...

468
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,735
...and then compete in a tournament...

469
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:18,342
...with the top teams going on
to the State Finals.

470
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,842
So that would be the Panthers
and two other teams.

471
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,318
- Oh, me, me, me.
- Yes, ma'am, right here.

472
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:32,047
I heard that there was this really hard
move called the Fountain of Troy...

473
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:33,986
...that some team did at the Worlds.

474
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:35,352
Are we gonna learn that?

475
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:38,496
Sure, I'll teach you
how to do the Fountain of Troy.

476
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:42,656
Then I'll teach you
to put makeup on a bear!

477
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:44,862
Absolutely not.

478
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:48,699
Not only is that move nearly impossible
to execute, it's extremely dangerous.

479
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,670
That move is prohibidado.

480
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,934
- Prohibi-what?
- Prohibidado.

481
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:57,775
And I say that in Spanish because
that's how exotic and not-allowed it is.

482
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,713
You can't even say "Fountain of Troy"
at this cheer camp.

483
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:03,285
- Go ahead and say it.
- Fountain of Tr-!

484
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,083
Stop it. What are you doing?
This isn't a game.

485
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:07,849
I'm not playing around up here.

486
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,186
Honey.

487
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,824
It's just a joke.
First week of cheer camp.

488
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:14,456
Lighten things up.

489
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,124
Have a good time.
Everybody say it, "Fountain of Troy. "

490
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,362
- Fountain of Tr-!
- Oh, my dear Lord! Oh, gosh, shut up!

491
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,369
He's lost his mind.

492
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,373
Stop it! Nobody does the
Fountain of Troy at this cheer camp.

493
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:28,068
Now, let's all hit the bunks
and get a good night's sleep.

494
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:29,474
Welcome to cheer camp.

495
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:42,650
Hi.

496
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,522
Dibs, dibs. Dibs on the blond
with the butterfly tattoo.

497
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,826
Dibs on that. I'd like that.
Tell me who it is.

498
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,094
- This is Lanie Brown.
- Lanie Brown.

499
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,501
She likes skiing, hip-hop, and playing
with her cat, Sir Pembleton.

500
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,074
- Sir Pembleton? You serious?
- I know, I'm not kidding.

501
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:00,506
I'm gonna write her name
in my book in no time.

502
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,579
Can't believe you document
your conquests.

503
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:05,011
Family owns a payroll company.
Love records.

504
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,174
- It's just weird.
- Tell it to our dog, FICA.

505
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,512
Oh, hey, Carly.

506
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,018
What's up, Tigers?

507
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:12,015
- Hey.
- Going to take a shower?

508
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,715
Yeah. I had my hand
in some kid's mouth this morning.

509
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,587
Good idea. I know where it's been.

510
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:20,595
And if I don't get some
flesh-eating virus from that...

511
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:23,029
...I probably will
after I take a shower barefoot.

512
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:25,862
- I forgot to pack my flip-flops.
- Sucks! See you later.

513
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,629
Oh, here. Take mine.

514
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,372
- I brought two pair.
- Really?

515
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,103
Yeah. No problem.
We're teammates.

516
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:35,737
Thanks.

517
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,347
- Bye.
- See you later.

518
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:46,255
Bro, what did I tell you? No hooking
up with girls from our school.

519
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,551
- I was just being nice.
- I don't care, man.

520
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,058
You know where nice leads.

521
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,321
Do not poop where you eat,
remember?

522
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:56,660
That's why there are no
restaurants called The Bathroom.

523
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:59,498
There are bathrooms at restaurants.

524
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,630
I was using a metaphor, Shawn.

525
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,674
It is crazy that people think
that you're the smart one.

526
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,270
What's up, ladies?

527
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:09,708
Hi.

528
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,975
You wanna borrow some flip-flops?
All right, see you later.

529
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:20,890
Welcome to day one, everybody.
Let's start with a warm-up run.

530
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:24,889
God, she's such a fox. I guarantee
I'm gonna tap that before we leave.

531
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,923
Dude, she's married,
and like 30 years old.

532
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:31,227
That's just how I like them:
ancient and regretful.

533
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:33,529
Yeah. Take it easy on the Dove bars.

534
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,536
- Ready, Shawnzy?
- Sure am, Nicholai.

535
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:36,799
New guys, move them.

536
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:43,640
I always knew there was
something else I should be doing.

537
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,306
You know,
like there was something more.

538
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,152
Something more inside me.

539
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,380
I guess you could say
I had a cheer waiting to get out.

540
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:57,084
And now, well, I live to cheer.

541
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:01,388
And I cheer to live.

542
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:08,905
I looked that little kitten
in the eyes...

543
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:10,802
...and I knew I had to take her home.

544
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:15,378
And now, Sniffles,
that's who I tell my secrets to.

545
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,481
My grandmother was a cheerleader.

546
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,742
It was what she loved most
in the world.

547
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:25,215
So when she died, I just
picked up the family pom-poms.

548
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,689
This is weird.
I don't usually open up like this.

549
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,523
It's weird.
I don't usually open up like this.

550
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:00,056
<i>Tigers!</i>

551
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,683
I love every bone in your body.

552
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,954
Especially mine...?

553
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,679
<i>Tigers!</i>

554
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:46,426
<i>Tigers can't be beat
Get up on your feet</i>

555
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:48,196
<i>Tigers can't be beat</i>

556
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:51,240
Is it my imagination, or do they
not completely, totally suck?

557
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,206
It's your imagination.

558
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,243
Now go imagine me
a bottle of water.

559
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,739
<i>Tigers!</i>

560
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,916
The French say a day moon brings
good luck to whoever sees it.

561
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,118
They also say 8-year-olds
should drink wine.

562
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:14,925
And if it's a crescent moon,
it'll bring good luck for a week.

563
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,265
What is it now?

564
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:21,201
I'm jogging with the captain of the best
squad, so I'd say it's pretty crescent.

565
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,135
- Race you.
- Cheering isn't a race.

566
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:26,243
- This isn't football.
- There's a competition at the end.

567
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:29,574
Yeah, you're right.
On your mark, get set...

568
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:31,715
Oh, she cheats. I like it.

569
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,043
Zucchini?

570
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:36,785
Leafy greens? Kale? Jicama?

571
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:38,012
And sprouts?

572
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:40,521
That's the only thing
that sucks about cheer camp.

573
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,454
The sacrifices
I make for ass.

574
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:45,629
Remember when I pretended to
be into Nickelback for that chick?

575
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,766
- God, they suck.
- So did she. Up top.

576
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:52,596
Dude, I am not gonna high-five you
for a beejer you got a year ago.

577
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:54,698
That doesn't count. No.

578
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:57,238
- Poppy.
- Hi, sis.

579
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:59,069
Guys looking to go off-menu?

580
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:02,371
I got Kit Kats, Snickers,
and German sweet tarts.

581
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:04,948
Wipes out the taste
of every other candy.

582
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:09,216
I'll take everything you got.

583
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:12,580
Not here, Shawshank.
The screws are watching.

584
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:15,590
Put it in the sycamore tree
out back.

585
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,727
- Where's our candy gonna be?
- Check your pockets.

586
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,065
I know. She's got the shine.

587
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,405
Oh, my God, this is so good.

588
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:35,269
Yeah, it is.

589
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,139
Diora!

590
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,244
Diora!

591
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:45,613
God, it is you.

592
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,690
The way the moonlight
caught your cheek...

593
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,191
...for a second there,
I thought you were an angel.

594
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,352
Nope, just the head
counselor who decides...

595
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,930
...whether or not to make you
run laps all tomorrow.

596
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,366
God, I love it, huh?

597
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:01,697
A little back and forth, witty repartee,
Hepburn and Tracy.

598
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,864
I'm not 16, kiddo.
Run along and play.

599
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:06,303
Still with the witty repartee,
that's terrific.

600
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:09,913
- You win this round, Miss Tracy.
- Hepburn was the girl.

601
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:11,878
Ding, ding. Knockout.

602
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:17,954
It shouldn't be this hard,
she's like 100 years old.

603
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:21,951
- Shawn. Got a second?
- Yeah. Sure.

604
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,689
Some of the girls have been
talking about you and Nick.

605
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:27,922
Don't believe anything anyone says.

606
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:31,500
They've been saying they think this is
the best the team has ever been.

607
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,935
Well, that you can believe.

608
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:36,835
I just wanted to say thanks.

609
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,335
You guys have been a big help.

610
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:41,668
Especially you.

611
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:44,712
Thanks.

612
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:48,374
It's nice to know that when I get tossed,
you're gonna be there to catch me.

613
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:50,453
I mean, not that Bianca wasn't good.

614
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:54,352
It's just, I don't know. You feel right.

615
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:56,652
I like it too.
You're like a home-run ball.

616
00:34:56,828 --> 00:35:00,662
Fifteen-inch brown trout.
A mild cold. Double feature.

617
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,857
I get it. Things that you catch.
Shut up.

618
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:04,528
I know at the beginning...

619
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:07,466
...I may have been against
you two joining the squad-

620
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:10,038
I believe you called us
"godless douche-monsters. "

621
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,005
It was "soulless beav-wranglers. "

622
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:15,008
Well, that's better.
I totally misunderstood you.

623
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:16,544
I'm trying to apologize here.

624
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,944
No need. And accepted.

625
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:24,412
Hey.

626
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:28,883
You'd think as a cheerleader
I would be a little more graceful.

627
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:33,328
I like you clumsy.
It's like I'm looking behind the curtain.

628
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,926
Babe.

629
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:39,794
Rick.

630
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,735
Rick.

631
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,410
- Who's the face-eater?
- Guys, come meet my boyfriend.

632
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:52,311
- What is with that car?
- Maybe he won an LPGA tournament.

633
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,919
I missed you.

634
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,253
Me too. Definitely.

635
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:05,292
Guys, this is my boyfriend.

636
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:08,660
- Pre-fiancé, actually.
- These are the guys I told you about.

637
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,631
- Nick and Shawn.
- What's up, guys? I'm Dr. Rick.

638
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,029
Really?

639
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:17,665
Pound?

640
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,901
Aren't you a little young
to be a doctor?

641
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:22,341
- He's pre-med.
- Then why call yourself "doctor"?

642
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,946
Why put off the inevitable?

643
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,985
You should get
that mole checked out.

644
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,815
I'd do it myself,
but I don't have my bag on me.

645
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:34,124
Your book bag?

646
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:37,557
- How'd you two crazy kids meet, Rick?
- It's a funny story, actually.

647
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:41,664
Our parents knew each other from
way back, and they introduced us.

648
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:49,462
Not that funny a story. Not really
even a story. Just like a fact.

649
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:51,968
We've been going out
since I was a sophomore.

650
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:56,044
We should hit it, Carly. I told the guys
we'd be done dinner in 45.

651
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,511
- The guys are with you?
- It was a long-ass drive, babe.

652
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:02,812
You didn't want me falling asleep
at the wheel, did you?

653
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:04,545
No, I'm glad you made it.

654
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:08,021
Yeah, you're glad.
I got a rezzy at Red Lobster.

655
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:11,252
We've got a booth in the back
behind a plant...

656
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:14,489
...so no one can see how much
we're all-you-can-eating.

657
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,227
If you know what I'm saying, boys.

658
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,003
Okay. Oh, Shawn.
I have something for you.

659
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,408
Sweet deal you kids
got going on here.

660
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,342
Wish I could hang out,
play all summer.

661
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:33,716
I'm just a little busy
picking my specialty.

662
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,011
Specialty? You're a freshman.

663
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,951
Your specialty should be putting a cow
in the dean's office.

664
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:41,387
<i>Animal House reference. Love it!</i>

665
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:47,389
My mom sent mine,
so I don't need yours anymore.

666
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,294
- Thanks.
- Sure.

667
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:55,261
And, chief. Next time, if my girl needs
something, she can borrow it from me.

668
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,404
Rick, he was just being nice.

669
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,101
Those feet look pretty small.
What are they, a seven?

670
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,871
Ten and a half, papo.

671
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:05,941
Eleven in Crocs.

672
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:17,319
What's the name of that girl
who was 5'7", blond hair, blue eyes?

673
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,656
She's like a dragon.
Reminds me of Christmas.

674
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:24,359
It's Carols, Care-holes, Car-
Caroline. Caroline.

675
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,570
I'm running out of ink.
You got a pen?

676
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,169
Mopey, I'm talking to you here.

677
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:31,035
You been sitting out here staring
into space for two hours.

678
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:33,972
- It's been five minutes.
- Really? That was five minutes?

679
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:37,137
Guess I really do suck in bed.

680
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:40,344
Get it? Like I think I'm Sting,
and in all reality...

681
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:43,954
...I'm like Chad Michael Murray
douching it out in five minutes.

682
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:45,486
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

683
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,453
- Come on, tell me.
- It's nothing.

684
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:48,751
- Tell me.
- It's nothing.

685
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:52,123
Tell me. Tell me, tell me, tell me...

686
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:53,627
- Nick.
- Sorry.

687
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:56,629
- Tell me?
- Carly's boyfriend's a real schwanz.

688
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:59,361
Dude, you like her. I knew it.
I knew you liked her.

689
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:01,232
- So? It's no big deal.
- No big deal?

690
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:03,669
She's on our squad.
You're gonna ruin everything.

691
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,504
Why you gotta do this, huh? Why you
gotta take a leak all over my dreams?

692
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,771
Why you lay a hot toddy
all over my hopes?

693
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:12,472
- You're being a little dramatic.
- Well, I have never.

694
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,083
What makes this girl so great, bro?

695
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:18,312
Yeah. What makes this girl
so great, bro?

696
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:20,081
There's just something about her.

697
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,725
You know when she bumped into me
on the bus?

698
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:27,762
Or when I saw her reading that book.
That she orders pudding for dessert.

699
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:30,765
Okay, now you're just listing things
that people do.

700
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:32,562
No, I'm not.

701
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:36,036
- Sometimes she writes with a pencil.
- So much worse than I thought.

702
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:37,804
You're really into this girl.

703
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,306
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

704
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,502
Why is she with that knob-rocket?

705
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,546
Enough already. You're even
depressing me, and I'm a Virgo.

706
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,876
We have got to cheer you up.

707
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,478
I'm two steps ahead of you, my man.

708
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:51,883
All right, gentlemen, saddle up.

709
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,651
Listen, ladies,
I couldn't help but notice...

710
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:58,124
...you were practicing your lifts
on dry ground.

711
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:00,024
Well, where else
would we practice?

712
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:05,167
The pond. That's where the top teams
do. Water resistance, better training.

713
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,270
Why do you think octopuses
have skinny arms?

714
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:08,996
That sounds like a good idea.

715
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:12,039
We can't. Our swimsuits are
all the way back at the bunks.

716
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:16,241
We could just go in our underwear.
I mean, that's all swimsuits are.

717
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,212
It's gonna be dark soon anyway,
so no one would see us.

718
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:23,114
I never thought about it like that,
but I guess you're right.

719
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,812
Look at that. We're all here
thinking inside the box...

720
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,254
...and you're outside
playing a game of "What If?"

721
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,793
Gorgeous and brilliant.
The triple threat.

722
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:34,964
And we're off. Gentlemen, ladies.

723
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:38,567
Adam, you've done enough
working out. Let's go.

724
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,139
Oh, there it is.

725
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:49,810
I am so excited.

726
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,778
I have not been skinny dipping
since Indian Scouts.

727
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:55,676
Nobody look.

728
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,214
Windmill.

729
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:01,290
We're leaving our underwear on.
We talked about this, remember?

730
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,086
You talked. I listened.

731
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:08,664
Paint the fence. Cutting the cake.
Hangman's noose. Hangman's noose.

732
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,425
Incoming.

733
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:25,207
Misjudged the depth.
It's all good. Learn from me.

734
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,114
This feels great.

735
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:03,412
It's the water resistance.
It helps strengthen.

736
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:05,680
It's twice the compound,
half the measure...

737
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:09,690
- ... and if you equivalate that to-
- Nick. Enough of that.

738
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,021
- Enough of what?
- Drop the game.

739
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:15,654
There are 300 girls at this camp
and only four straight guys.

740
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:18,825
It's no mystery why you're ripping
through the place. So come on.

741
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:23,796
Come on.

742
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:26,241
Tick tock.

743
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:30,173
Oh, all right.

744
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:38,677
You're next.

745
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:41,819
Ladies.

746
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:51,700
- Where are our clothes?
- We left them right here.

747
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:54,838
I know. That's why I'm saying,
"Where are our clothes?"

748
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:58,941
I'm blazing a trail. I'm blazing a trail.

749
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:00,508
See you guys.

750
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,873
- Okay, have a great Thanksgiving.
- What?

751
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,105
I don't know, I'm cold.

752
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,916
- I'm cold and I'm flailing.
- I know, I know.

753
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,418
How are you not flailing?

754
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,784
I'm flailing. I too am also flailing.

755
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:17,084
- So how was she?
- How was who?

756
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,889
- The blond you were making time with.
- I wasn't.

757
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:23,261
We just talked. She's really nice.
Her grandmother's from Cincinnati.

758
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,593
She helped me on
my crossover basket launches.

759
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,862
I can't believe how high
my extensions are.

760
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:30,006
I don't know who you are anymore.

761
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,732
Boys.

762
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,071
What are you doing?
It's way past curfew.

763
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:36,371
We were just...

764
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,178
Practicing.

765
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:42,583
- Yeah.
- Al dente?

766
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:46,411
Yeah. We like to do cheers in the nude
so that they really sink in.

767
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:49,423
That way our bodies learn it
as well as our minds.

768
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:52,989
That's very Alvin Ailey of you.
I like it.

769
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:55,927
- Proceed.
- Proceed with what, running away?

770
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,931
No, with the cheer, you goose.

771
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:01,435
Don't you wanna wait for
another coach? Or a witness?

772
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:02,765
Five, six, seven, eight.

773
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,167
- Ready?
- Okay.

774
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:05,638
<i>Hey, Tigers!</i>

775
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,140
<i>- Yeah?
- Hey, Tigers!</i>

776
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:11,008
<i>Yeah? What do we like to eat?
Panther meat</i>

777
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:12,739
<i>I said, hey, Tigers!</i>

778
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,406
<i>- Yeah?
- Hey, Tigers!</i>

779
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:18,043
<i>Yeah? What do we like to do?
Defeat</i>

780
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:20,682
- Dude, your crankshaft.
- Two.

781
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,653
<i>Orange, black and white unite</i>

782
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,318
<i>Tigers, Tigers, fight, fight, fight!</i>

783
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,192
Tailpipe.

784
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:32,327
Your counts are off,
your spacing is insane...

785
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,165
...and your moves sloppier
than a kiss from a midshipman.

786
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:38,205
- What?
- Take it from the top. Positions.

787
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,040
Parallel positions!

788
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,041
Five, six, seven, eight.

789
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:45,443
<i>Go bananas
Go, go bananas</i>

790
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:49,313
<i>Go bananas
Go, go bananas</i>

791
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:54,124
You can put me down now.

792
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:55,689
Oh, can I?

793
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:57,855
You jerk.

794
00:44:58,562 --> 00:44:59,586
Jack-knocker.

795
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:01,390
Oh, look.

796
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:04,295
- What are they doing?
- It's the Fountain of Troy.

797
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:06,459
I thought that move
was prohibidimabido.

798
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,239
- My face!
- It's okay, it's okay.

799
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:13,535
What'd I tell you about
that Fountain of Troy?

800
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,338
Look, you broke her face.

801
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:18,777
Where am I gonna get another one
of those this late in the day?

802
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:20,849
Someone call a doctor!

803
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:22,349
Damn, I wish Rick were here.

804
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:25,420
Why, so he could ask someone
to call a doctor?

805
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:29,017
Ever been to
a cheerleading competition?

806
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:31,127
Oh, you mean like a football game?

807
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:34,264
No, not a game.
Those are like practices for us.

808
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:36,422
I'm talking about a tournament.

809
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,468
ESPN cameras all around. Hundreds
of people in crowds cheering.

810
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:43,435
Wait.
People cheering cheerleaders?

811
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:48,068
You should be in the movies.

812
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:51,543
You're hotter than all of these
cheerleaders rolled together.

813
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,874
Cheerleaders rolled together.

814
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,786
I gotta take a Louis Leakey.

815
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:02,892
Listen, you, don't get any cuter
while I'm gone. I'm serious.

816
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,291
And let me give you a little tip
from a cheerleader.

817
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:09,955
<i>Be aggressive
B- E aggressive</i>

818
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:15,032
Where's that Jesse Bradford boy?
I love him. No, seriously.

819
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:16,934
Seriously. I love him.

820
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,777
I gotta be honest with you, man.

821
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,277
I don't think I'm into
all this hooking up anymore.

822
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,110
- It feels wrong.
- Yeah, it's supposed to feel wrong.

823
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,876
No, I mean, I feel guilty.

824
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:31,850
I don't know what you're saying.
Milty? Wilty?

825
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:33,216
Something's not right.

826
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:36,188
- Tilty?
- I've never felt this way before.

827
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:38,051
Maquilty?

828
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,661
Is that Dr. Rick?

829
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:49,835
Awesome song.

830
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:54,702
Dude, these local chicks are so easy.
It's like banging fish in a barrel.

831
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:58,609
That Gina was a freak. I've got
bite marks all over my badonkadonk.

832
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:01,542
Or was that Aubrey?
Whichever one smells like lavender.

833
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:03,083
I got that stuff all over me.

834
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,778
One of you smell my rod,
will you?

835
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:07,548
Jesus. This guy's a dick.

836
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:10,352
I don't get why you came here.
You don't even like Carly.

837
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:12,927
I told you, man.
Our parents are old friends...

838
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:16,463
...which means they approve of her,
they give me anything I want...

839
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:19,693
...including this sick
3- series Beemer, with nav...

840
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:21,804
...that drove your fat ass up here.

841
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,303
Rock it.

842
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:25,705
Why you gotta take a shot
at my weight?

843
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:27,207
You know I'm working on it.

844
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:28,469
He's just using her.

845
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:32,376
And he likes to get bit in
the badonkadonk, that sick bastard.

846
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:33,573
I gotta tell her.

847
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,981
- Yeah, no, buddy. Don't tell her.
- No, I have to.

848
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,484
No, no, you really don't.

849
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:39,781
Yeah, I kind of do.

850
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:43,950
It's pretty obvious that you're gonna
go against everything I stand for...

851
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:48,757
...and poop where you eat, so at least
let me help you take that poop, okay?

852
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:50,900
Trust me, bro, don't tell her.

853
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:53,764
Why? She needs to find out
what kind of guy he really is.

854
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:57,839
If you tell her, you'll be the guy who
told her her boyfriend is cheating.

855
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:01,239
- Yeah?
- Bro, that's all you're ever gonna be.

856
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,845
Best-case scenario,
she looks at you as a girlfriend.

857
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:07,506
Worst-case scenario, she's pissed
at you for poking in her business.

858
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,845
Either way, you're not poking
in her business.

859
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:11,979
You marinate with that.

860
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:18,059
- I hear you. That's good advice.
- It is good advice.

861
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,093
- Thanks.
- That's what friends are for.

862
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:21,424
- Are you good?
- I'm good.

863
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:22,656
Carly!

864
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:26,300
Hey, Carly. There's something
I have to tell you. Carly!

865
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:29,237
I was wondering where you were.

866
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:32,569
I was looking for you too.
But you go first. What's up?

867
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,371
I was just wondering
about the moon.

868
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:39,606
I mean, is it still crescent
or a half-moon?

869
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:41,478
What the French
have to say about it?

870
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,144
I'm an idiot.

871
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:48,587
No. No, it's a waxing crescent moon
tonight, and you're not an idiot.

872
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,159
Unless you don't know
what "waxing" means.

873
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:54,263
I'm a cheerleader,
I know what "waxing" means.

874
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:57,729
- Carly horse.
- Rick.

875
00:48:57,901 --> 00:49:00,893
- That's what he calls you?
- Yeah. He means it cute.

876
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:06,670
- What's up, high school?
- You smell like lavender.

877
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:08,735
Yeah.

878
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:11,472
We're learning about the effects
of lavender therapy...

879
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:13,411
...on type-two carcinoma patients.

880
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:18,486
How's that working out? Anyone go
into remission after smelling a flower?

881
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:22,822
All right, you caught me, man.

882
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:28,826
- I picked you some flowers, Carly.
- That is so sweet. Where are they?

883
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,362
I made a special wish on them
and threw them into the sky.

884
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:33,861
That is so romantic.

885
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:37,734
We should hit it, Carlito's Way. I told
the guys I'd be done with dinner in 40.

886
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,899
I'll see you at practice?

887
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:42,477
Shawn here is a great
leather-basket tosser.

888
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:45,610
What a great trick.

889
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:47,249
Not as good as yours.

890
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,213
I'll see you tomorrow, Shawn.

891
00:50:05,702 --> 00:50:08,364
- Awesome date.
- I'll see you at the competition?

892
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:10,199
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

893
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:18,738
Bye.

894
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:25,816
I like you a lot, Carles Barkley.
You're one of the good ones, babe.

895
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:48,104
You know what reminds me
of the better times?

896
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:52,339
Before Carly started hanging out
with those two little suck-buckets.

897
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,039
Something's up with them.

898
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,276
Wanna stay and do some digging?

899
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,683
Big-time. You know why?

900
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:09,495
Awesome song. Chumbawamba.
It's the soundtrack to my life, man.

901
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:18,540
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

902
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,335
<i>Go, Tigers!</i>

903
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:23,377
Cradle. One, two.

904
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,048
Great job, guys.
Let's take a little water break.

905
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:31,687
Are my hips rotating too late
before the final toss?

906
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:35,018
I wasn't gonna say anything,
but you gotta rotate and then catch.

907
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:36,955
Rotate, then catch.

908
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:39,925
- We're out of water.
- We need two volunteers to refill.

909
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,257
- I'll go.
- Me too.

910
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:44,958
Dude, don't go. Hey, Shawn.

911
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:46,759
God-

912
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,337
That was really good.
Keep it up, okay?

913
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,574
Hi.

914
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,744
Listen, I don't know
if I've told you this yet...

915
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:59,245
...but your coaching, I mean,
it's been incredible.

916
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:03,545
And whatever happens between us,
you've made me a better cheerleader.

917
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:06,654
- And for that, I owe you-
- You have some food in your teeth.

918
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:11,082
And your pecs are uneven.
Make sure you don't favor one side.

919
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:12,855
Always coaching.

920
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:15,463
God bless you!

921
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,927
Why can't I crack this?

922
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:20,160
Damn it.

923
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:21,867
So...

924
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:26,008
...how often did you see Dr. Rick
during the school year?

925
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:29,634
I don't know why he keeps calling
himself that. It's kind of douchey.

926
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,145
Oh, no, no, no. It's super cool.

927
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:35,143
I can't believe he's my pre-fiancé.

928
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,445
I remember when I was 7,
I decided...

929
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:40,647
...that I was not gonna get married
until I was 34.

930
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:44,988
- That's very specific.
- Oh, I had it all thought out.

931
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,528
High school, college,
a year abroad in Greece...

932
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:50,723
...and because, don't laugh,
I always loved Greek salad.

933
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:54,837
Tomatoes, cucumbers, feta.
No, that makes perfect sense.

934
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,233
I know. It's silly.

935
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:58,237
I love that you had it
all planned out.

936
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:01,707
- You know what John Lennon said.
- Not really. I'm not in my 50s.

937
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:02,970
I could ask my dad.

938
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:05,842
"Life is what happens when
you're busy making other plans. "

939
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:07,581
Yeah.

940
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:17,723
Damn, this is heavy.

941
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:20,226
Are you okay? You look hot.
Do you want some water?

942
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:21,864
- Yeah, sure. Thanks.
- Here.

943
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:28,769
Did you say I looked hot?
I'm pretty sure that's what I heard.

944
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:31,635
- I heard you screaming like a girl.
- Oh, really?

945
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:34,003
Oh, my God. Don't move.
There's a bee on you.

946
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:36,941
What? No. Get it off.

947
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:39,948
You little bitch!

948
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:45,084
All right, week three of cheer camp,
here we come.

949
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:47,246
I love the smell of pom-pom
in the morning.

950
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:48,891
Let's do this.

951
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:52,156
- Where you going?
- Post-breakfast practice.

952
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:55,787
And then, you know, Carly and I are
gonna work on reverse cartwheels.

953
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:59,629
My left foot keeps hitching when
I do my inverse swing-over. It's like:

954
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:02,203
Take it easy.
We're done with this, all right?

955
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,929
Week three. Hit it and quit it.

956
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:06,803
Oh, no, we gotta-
We gotta stay longer.

957
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:09,707
Dude, it's time to go.
Remember Mookie's dad's house?

958
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:11,278
The plasmas and the Jacuzzis.

959
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:14,542
Yeah, but I just- I think
we should stay just a touch longer.

960
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:16,686
I'm done. All right?
I've had enough girl.

961
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:19,549
Breadsticks only keep you
at the Olive Garden for so long.

962
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:21,054
Till, at some point, you say:

963
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,556
"Why am I at Olive Garden
with these fat people?"

964
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:25,354
- What? No...
- Let's go.

965
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:28,258
- Let's talk about this.
- All right, let's go. Let's pack.

966
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:30,160
Let's just dialogue for a second.

967
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,767
- We don't have to go right now.
- Yeah, we do.

968
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,598
The bus leaves in an hour.
Next one's not until tomorrow.

969
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,263
Yeah, but come on, man.
What about our squad?

970
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,238
You know,
the competition's coming up.

971
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:43,140
Dude, the squad? The competition?
Listen to yourself.

972
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:45,577
We had a deal. Two weeks. Right?

973
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:48,183
Kiss, kiss, bang, bang,
sayonara, cheer camp.

974
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:50,342
<i>We are leaving
We, we are leaving</i>

975
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,578
<i>We are leaving</i>

976
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:53,513
Now, come on, dude, start packing.

977
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:56,682
I need a little bit more time with Carly.
There. I said it. Okay?

978
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:59,522
I know you think that's lame,
but can you give me one day?

979
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:02,164
That's not lame, bro. That's gay.

980
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:05,824
Well, technically, pursuing a woman
you have heterosexual feelings for...

981
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:07,503
...that's not gay, Nick.

982
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:10,799
But using a rotating inverse
swing-over to do it? Yeah, that is.

983
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:14,774
Shawn. Don't forget we're gonna
go over our reverse cartwheels.

984
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:17,378
- Okay, I'll be right there.
- See you there.

985
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:19,105
All right. Right behind him.

986
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:22,274
All right, come on, man, let's go.
You know the deal.

987
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:25,118
And trust me,
you're gonna thank me for this.

988
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,989
All right, let's go, Shawnzy.
And no more moping. All right?

989
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,719
Not an attractive color on you,
nor is orange and gray.

990
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,556
Takes away from your eyes.

991
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:45,532
Damn it, damn it, damn it...

992
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,406
What are you doing?

993
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:55,016
Well, probably making
the biggest mistake of my life.

994
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,312
Except that year
I wore that leather wristband.

995
00:55:57,487 --> 00:56:00,854
How did I possibly think that's cool,
you know? I'm not a blacksmith.

996
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,651
That was a little Nickelback-y.

997
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:05,158
You like this girl,
you're my boy, we stay.

998
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:07,057
Well, what about Mookie's house?

999
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:08,822
Are you coming or not?

1000
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:12,390
Are you sure we are staying?
We, we are staying?

1001
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:15,265
No, I'm not sure,
so don't turn a yes into a no.

1002
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:17,497
Thank you, Nick.
Thank you so much, man.

1003
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:19,665
I know you don't like
man-to-man touching...

1004
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:23,370
...but my arm is on your shoulder.
Here comes my arm right now.

1005
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,514
<i>- Another day
- Another holler</i>

1006
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:29,914
You're wasting my precious breath.
I can't hear you.

1007
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:32,179
<i>- Another day
- Another holler</i>

1008
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:34,323
<i>- Another day
- Another holler</i>

1009
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:35,515
<i>Another day</i>

1010
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:38,085
Hey, bro, got a second?

1011
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:40,762
Wrong section of the woods.

1012
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:43,455
You want the northeast corner
near the redwoods.

1013
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:47,168
What? I wanna know if you know
two dudes named Nick and Shawn.

1014
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:50,567
Yeah. They're my bunkmates. Why?

1015
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:56,808
Five, six, seven, eight. One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1016
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:00,239
- Angela, no.
- Are you okay?

1017
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:03,113
Easy, Tiger. Easy, Tiger.

1018
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:08,418
- I'm fine. I'm fine, I'm fine.
- You all right?

1019
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:09,717
I'm okay.

1020
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:13,789
Sorry, guys, I just suck.

1021
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:17,558
- It's not just you. We all kind of suck.
- We're not good at all.

1022
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:21,399
- Hey, stop. Stop talking like that.
- But it's true.

1023
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:23,163
We're just not that good.

1024
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:25,133
Stop.

1025
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:28,402
Enough of that.
You can go as far as you want.

1026
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:31,338
What do the Panthers have
that you don't have?

1027
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:32,708
- Skills.
- Athleticism.

1028
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:34,406
- Kickass cheers.
- Hair removal.

1029
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:37,075
Big-ass titties. I'm just saying.

1030
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:40,086
Confidence.
They're cocky assholes.

1031
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:43,748
Like Nick, the cockiest asshole on the
football field. That's why he's good.

1032
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:46,157
- I'm awesome.
- Because he believes in himself.

1033
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:47,489
Also because I'm awesome.

1034
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:50,792
He knows he's gonna be good,
so he's good. And he takes chances.

1035
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,662
Due to the fact that I'm awesome.

1036
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:55,669
- Nick. Trying to make a speech here.
- I'm sorry.

1037
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,467
Either bet big or go home.

1038
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:02,040
If you don't wanna take any chances,
then you shouldn't even be here.

1039
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:05,679
I know you wanna be here, because
you finish last every single year...

1040
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:07,476
...but you keep coming back...

1041
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,811
...even if it means
taking endless shit...

1042
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,511
...from total dong-knockers
like the Panthers.

1043
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:14,280
I wanna cut the blond one.

1044
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:15,685
- What?
- What?

1045
00:58:15,859 --> 00:58:17,451
- What?
- What?

1046
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:20,391
- What?
- I'm just saying.

1047
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,462
Come on, guys.
Let's be cocky assholes.

1048
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:25,032
He's right.

1049
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:26,225
And I can say that...

1050
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:30,065
...because I am the best cheerleader
here, so you can all suck my dick.

1051
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:34,605
I was just being a cocky asshole.

1052
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:38,372
Oh, nice. Did you see
what she was doing there?

1053
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:41,016
That's exactly what I want
from everybody.

1054
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,811
All right, let's do this.

1055
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:46,444
And remember, you're awesome.
Let's risk it to get the biscuit.

1056
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:48,056
All right, get cocky, bitches.

1057
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:53,555
Let's do it. Come on, guys. Ready.

1058
00:58:53,763 --> 00:58:54,991
<i>Hit it!</i>

1059
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:57,394
<i>All you chumps
Think you got poise</i>

1060
00:58:57,567 --> 00:58:59,694
<i>You prance around like little toys</i>

1061
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,133
<i>Do you really think
You can make some noise?</i>

1062
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:04,170
Five, six, seven, eight.

1063
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:05,671
<i>Tigers!</i>

1064
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:07,571
- Get cocky.
- Get cocky.

1065
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:10,279
Come on, everybody.

1066
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:14,373
<i>Let's go, tigres.</i>

1067
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,208
There it is.

1068
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,080
All right, get cocky.

1069
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:22,485
Here we go, here we go.

1070
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:23,785
Keep it tight.

1071
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:39,772
Everybody, let's work.

1072
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:53,580
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1073
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:54,882
There it is.

1074
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:56,525
Go big, Shawnzy.

1075
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,691
I'm doing it, brother.

1076
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,400
Awesome. So much better.

1077
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:15,267
<i>Tigers!</i>

1078
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:19,645
<i>All right, la tigres. Come on.</i>

1079
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:22,044
That's my girls,
bringing some A-game.

1080
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:24,276
You are some cocky bitches.

1081
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:27,787
I think it's safe to say that you guys
are now officially Tigers.

1082
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,891
- Right, girls?
- All right.

1083
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:31,492
One, two, three.

1084
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:33,026
Tigers!

1085
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:36,054
One, two, three, frauds!

1086
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,991
- Rick?
- These two have been playing you.

1087
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:41,398
They didn't come
because they like cheerleading.

1088
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:43,766
They came here because
they like cheerleaders.

1089
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,238
- Yeah, we know.
- Everyone knows.

1090
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,274
Why are you here?
What's going on, Rick?

1091
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:51,311
- Bus tickets.
- Damn it.

1092
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,507
Your friends were planning on leaving
before the competition...

1093
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:57,778
...without any feeling for anyone
they may have left in their wake.

1094
01:00:57,954 --> 01:00:59,421
- Animals.
- You were gonna leave?

1095
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:02,922
Well, we were gonna, but we didn't.
That's way before you and I ever-

1096
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:05,754
- You were gonna do this to the squad?
- I can explain.

1097
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:09,659
I can't believe you. I mean,
I knew you were here to get girls, but...

1098
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,130
- ... I thought you started to get into it.
- I did.

1099
01:01:12,301 --> 01:01:15,498
It started off being about girls,
but then it became about you.

1100
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,505
- Wait, that doesn't sound right.
- That sounds exactly right.

1101
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,199
Bail, brother. Bail.

1102
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:22,037
I really like you, Carly.

1103
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:23,610
That's close enough, dicklick.

1104
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:27,739
This is how you show someone you
like them, Shawn? By lying to them?

1105
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:30,750
To be fair, he lied to you
before he really cared...

1106
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:34,378
...then he tried super hard to word it
so it wouldn't be a lie after that.

1107
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:36,149
Just so we're on the same page.

1108
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:40,119
If these weren't tools for healing,
I would crack you in the jaw.

1109
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:42,196
- You're a tool for healing.
- That's right.

1110
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,299
You're the guy
who's fancy with his words.

1111
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:47,061
Well, then, why don't
I just read your diary?

1112
01:01:47,236 --> 01:01:50,103
- Where did you get that?
- I've done a bad thing. I'm so sorry.

1113
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:53,208
I'm sorry. I'm a sorry Suzy
right now. He tricked me.

1114
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:54,866
You tricked me.

1115
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,443
This is how it happened.

1116
01:01:57,246 --> 01:01:58,270
Brewster!

1117
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:01,440
He said he wanted to leave you a note,
I brought him to the bunk.

1118
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:03,448
He must've seen
your stuff on the couch.

1119
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:06,213
- Why was it on the couch?
- I was cleaning up your mess.

1120
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,516
I told you I can't stand clutter.
I warned you.

1121
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:12,149
- Give me the book back.
- "Cheer camp, day one.

1122
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:16,259
The sun rises in the summer sky...

1123
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:19,560
...like Rembrandt's brush
on a dogwood branch. "

1124
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:22,803
- Queeratron.
- Let's go. Give it to me.

1125
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:26,164
Back up, Abercrombie & Bitch.

1126
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:29,774
"And thereby Diora-"

1127
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:38,510
"I lie awake thinking, will I ever say
'Diora,' as a whisper in an ear?

1128
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:41,452
Will she ever say "I love you,"
in a moment with a tear?"

1129
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:44,286
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

1130
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:48,527
Carly, I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1131
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:52,327
Just leave, okay? Just leave
like you always planned on doing.

1132
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:55,369
Carly, please, let me explain.
Give me just one second.

1133
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:57,369
See you later, high school.

1134
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:00,373
I didn't write that. I bought the book.
It was in there.

1135
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:01,874
It was beautiful.

1136
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:03,940
Thanks.

1137
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:09,317
Never really thought of that one.

1138
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:12,977
Using one's true feelings
to wrangle snooch.

1139
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:15,513
So simple.

1140
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:33,074
So we lied and we got caught.
So what, huh?

1141
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:34,971
We're humans. Humans lie.

1142
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:38,580
They tell big gigantic two-week-long
lies because they're humans.

1143
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:41,478
Stop saying "humans. " We did this.

1144
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,278
Because we're humans.

1145
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:46,387
All right, humans are
the only species that can lie.

1146
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:49,187
Except for maybe chameleons.

1147
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:52,326
And possums. They play dead.

1148
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:56,925
What's that?

1149
01:03:57,099 --> 01:04:00,227
It's Downey's bracelet.
Yeah, I love that kid, huh?

1150
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:02,769
Said it was cool, so he gave it to me.
How nice.

1151
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:05,999
Those are his... beads, bro.

1152
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:08,439
Downey liked you.
Like, "liked you" liked you.

1153
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:11,239
What? That's crazy.
Downey isn't gay.

1154
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:14,349
Nick, come on. Think about it.

1155
01:04:14,884 --> 01:04:16,647
I'm Nick. This is Shawn.

1156
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:19,788
- What's up? I'm Downey.
- Hey. Nice to meet you.

1157
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:23,551
Put it in there.
A little cheer camp. Crazy good times.

1158
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:25,057
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

1159
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:27,662
<i>Panther meat!
I said, hey, Tigers!</i>

1160
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:29,923
<i>- Yeah?
- Hey, Tigers!</i>

1161
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:32,226
Diora.

1162
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:34,369
Hey, Nick.
You wanna go out on the field...

1163
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,562
...and maybe count shooting stars
with me?

1164
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:39,071
You're classic, Downey. Classic.

1165
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:47,944
Raw-hamburger fight!

1166
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:03,896
I'm hit.

1167
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:08,801
Medic!
This man needs some jocks-ygen.

1168
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:11,530
Come on, we're losing him.

1169
01:05:11,707 --> 01:05:16,201
Don't you die on me. Don't die on me.
Don't you die on me.

1170
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:18,878
<i>You prance around like little toys</i>

1171
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:21,414
<i>Do you really think
You can make some noise?</i>

1172
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,415
Five, six, seven, eight.

1173
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,486
<i>Tigers!</i>

1174
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:32,821
Welcome back to Sucktown.
Population: you.

1175
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:37,227
Without your gigolos, looks like
you got last place sewn up, again.

1176
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,597
Why don't you get your nose job
out of everybody else's business.

1177
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:41,964
I got thrown by a horse.

1178
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:44,766
Why? Was he spooked because
you both have the same face?

1179
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,670
You're gonna die. You're gonna die.

1180
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:48,070
Carly, don't.

1181
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:52,180
You're placing your anger at the boys
on them. It's transference.

1182
01:05:52,381 --> 01:05:54,713
You're right.
I'm gonna punch you in the throat!

1183
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,009
Let it go.

1184
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:02,985
Look at that little hottie. Wonder
what she wants to do with her life.

1185
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:04,416
What?

1186
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:07,153
You know how Bianca
wants to go to cooking school...

1187
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:09,694
...and Sylvia wants to be a pilot,
and...

1188
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:10,923
Oh, my God.

1189
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:14,626
I actually know these girls,
as, like, friends.

1190
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,203
And I care.

1191
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:18,272
I'm becoming
like a fully formed person...

1192
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:20,409
...with like sensitivity and empathy.

1193
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:23,435
All right, I'm a person!

1194
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:26,706
Look at the pooper on that one.
I could rest my beer on that shit.

1195
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:29,680
And you're back. What kind of
dressing goes on a Greek salad?

1196
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:31,547
Olive oil, top shelf.

1197
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:42,829
Is it me, Shawnzy, or is this not nearly
as much fun as it was last year?

1198
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,023
It's not you.

1199
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,225
This is too high. Give me a boost.

1200
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:50,229
Shoulder stand.

1201
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:51,873
- Ready?
- Okay.

1202
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:54,875
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1203
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:57,137
- Grab.
- Out, drop, catch, dismount.

1204
01:06:58,047 --> 01:06:59,912
Catch. Yeah, buddy.

1205
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:01,481
Guys?

1206
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:03,808
Don't take this the wrong way...

1207
01:07:03,986 --> 01:07:06,420
...but I think there's someone
you should talk to.

1208
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,851
Hello, I'm am Reginald
von Belly Button.

1209
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:12,392
I love Twinkies.

1210
01:07:23,272 --> 01:07:26,173
The competition's tomorrow.
I wonder if we could win it.

1211
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:28,906
Did you say
"I wonder if we could win"?

1212
01:07:29,078 --> 01:07:30,409
- No.
- Yes, you did.

1213
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:32,342
- You totally did.
- Didn't.

1214
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:34,778
You wanna go back.
You're into cheering.

1215
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:38,647
I'm the captain of the football team.
I could give a rat's ass about cheering.

1216
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:41,255
- You're a cheerleader.
- You're misquoting me.

1217
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:42,482
Do you wanna go back?

1218
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:45,718
For you. Because I can't stand
seeing my best friend in Frown Town.

1219
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,089
That's how selfless I am.

1220
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:50,027
I would sacrifice myself
to cheer you up. I'm like Gandhi.

1221
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:52,599
- Gandhi?
- Gandhi!

1222
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:55,931
- Mahatma K. Gandhi.
- Quake'n Bake!

1223
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:00,602
Bus leaves in 20 minutes.

1224
01:08:02,311 --> 01:08:05,644
If we extend our high V's, we have
a chance at landing that aerial.

1225
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:08,045
I don't know who you are anymore.

1226
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:10,515
Kenny's asleep on the couch.

1227
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:13,154
We're gonna get whipped cream
and paint his face.

1228
01:08:13,322 --> 01:08:15,051
- Come on.
- Be right there, dudes.

1229
01:08:15,224 --> 01:08:17,784
- Right behind you, bro.
- Oh, my horse is peeing.

1230
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:36,971
What is that?

1231
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,341
Go back to sleep.

1232
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:45,684
Why are you in my bed?

1233
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:48,083
I must have sleepwalked.

1234
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:50,851
I'm here now.
Let's just make the best of it.

1235
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,628
Get out of my bed, Bianca.

1236
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:57,027
- I kind of can't.
- Why?

1237
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:59,133
I might not have pants on.

1238
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:03,829
- What are you doing here?
- I came back.

1239
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:07,237
- I can see that. Goodbye.
- Carly, just listen to me.

1240
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:08,808
- Why?
- We're teammates.

1241
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,378
Teammates don't join a team
under false pretenses...

1242
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:13,538
...then leave once they
get what they want.

1243
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:16,514
I know you're pissed at me,
and you should be. I lied to you.

1244
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:20,781
But this is about the squad. We all
worked way too hard to throw it away.

1245
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:22,787
How are you standing in the air?

1246
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:25,222
Just take us back already. Christ!

1247
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:26,986
Nick. Carly...

1248
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,256
...I like you,
but that's not why I'm here.

1249
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:30,796
Oh, rock me, sexy Jesus.

1250
01:09:30,966 --> 01:09:32,433
- Why are you here?
- Honestly?

1251
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:35,593
- No. Lie to me again.
- Shawnzy, make it quick, buddy.

1252
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:38,467
- Buddy.
- I like cheering.

1253
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:41,468
Fraggle Rock.

1254
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:42,736
I'm sorry, man.

1255
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,203
My pecs are sore.

1256
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:48,077
Oh, my God, Diora's right.
My left side is weaker.

1257
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,514
- I favor one side.
- Pull me up. Pull me up.

1258
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:53,154
Is this your plan
to get a little face time with me?

1259
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:55,984
No. I'm dying here, seriously.

1260
01:09:56,859 --> 01:10:00,351
- Carly, come on. We need them.
- I don't wanna come in last again.

1261
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:04,764
Fine. But I'm only doing this
for the squad.

1262
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:06,333
You got it.

1263
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:11,236
- Bianca?
- Yeah.

1264
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:14,899
Any chance you could throw on
a pair of underpants?

1265
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:19,509
It's competition day today.
Competition.

1266
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,050
- Wow, this is big-time.
- Yeah, it is.

1267
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:32,319
Well, well, well, if it isn't a couple
of wolves in cheer clothing.

1268
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:35,622
Which part of "next time I see
your punim they'll be on the moon"...

1269
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:38,790
- ... didn't you understand?
- Like, the whole thing?

1270
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:41,630
I'm gonna have to go ahead
and ask you both to go ahead...

1271
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:44,136
...and leave right now to leave now.

1272
01:10:44,306 --> 01:10:46,331
It's all right.
I told them they could stay.

1273
01:10:46,508 --> 01:10:49,500
You really want these strong-jawed
philanderers on your squad?

1274
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:50,702
Yeah.

1275
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,871
It was just a little misunderstanding
we had before.

1276
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:55,141
All right. Your choice.

1277
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:59,117
Next time you screw up,
I'm gonna have both your asses.

1278
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:00,612
That's frightening.

1279
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:02,814
Let's move it along.
Giddyup and roar.

1280
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:05,324
Let me see those claws.
Move it along.

1281
01:11:05,494 --> 01:11:10,431
Meet me on Taryn Field tonight
after the competition. Bring your diary.

1282
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:12,801
Only if you bring the dance
in your step...

1283
01:11:12,968 --> 01:11:16,165
...like a shimmering nymph
traveling the back of the wind.

1284
01:11:19,408 --> 01:11:22,400
Good afternoon, and welcome
to Channel 29's coverage...

1285
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:25,809
...of the Regional Southeastern
Illinois Cheerleading Competition.

1286
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:57,268
Bend at the hips and reach through
your hands. Don't lock-

1287
01:11:57,446 --> 01:12:01,177
God, please give us the strength to
land our flip-flops and basket tosses.

1288
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:03,181
Amen. Oh, and fix the economy.

1289
01:12:03,352 --> 01:12:05,980
- Red leather, yellow leather.
- Red leather, yellow leather.

1290
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:08,623
- Unique New York.
- Unique New York.

1291
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:11,918
- Barack, Barack, Barack Obama.
- Barack, Barack, Barack Obama.

1292
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:17,999
Five, six, seven, eight.
Kill, Panthers, kill. Panthers, kill...

1293
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:24,631
- Shawn.
- Carly.

1294
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,873
- What you did really hurt me.
- I know, I know. I know.

1295
01:12:28,043 --> 01:12:32,810
I want you to know why. It's just
I thought you and I got really close...

1296
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:34,175
...and I trusted you.

1297
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,580
I know.
I felt the same way about you.

1298
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:41,717
I'm really sorry, Carly.
And I don't expect you to forgive me.

1299
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:43,357
I want you to know I'm sorry.

1300
01:12:43,992 --> 01:12:46,392
There's my Carly Davidson!

1301
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:51,329
Hi, Rick.

1302
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:57,301
- Just came by to say break a leg.
- That's theater. This is cheering.

1303
01:12:57,473 --> 01:12:58,940
You better believe it.

1304
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:01,770
- What's up, Dick?
- It's Rick. Dr. Rick.

1305
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:05,772
God, I keep doing that.
You just look like such a Dick to me.

1306
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:07,882
What are you crunt-sacks
doing back here?

1307
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:10,917
It's okay. They're just helping us
do our final routine.

1308
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:12,383
I'll be watching you.

1309
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:16,388
Yeah. That's exactly what an audience
member does at a performance event.

1310
01:13:16,592 --> 01:13:18,059
Just go sit down, Rick.

1311
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:23,460
<i>Robert De Niro,
Meet the Parents reference. Love it.</i>

1312
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:26,758
- God, he seems great.
- Really nice.

1313
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:27,959
I like him.

1314
01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:38,739
Here you go. Look alive.

1315
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,745
Coming at you.
Here you go. Look alive.

1316
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:43,817
Coming at you. Here you go,
freak shows. New uniforms.

1317
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:46,986
- Here you go. Look alive.
- We didn't order these.

1318
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:49,283
No shit, lesbatron. My brother did.

1319
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:51,619
We're a new squad.
We need new uniforms.

1320
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:54,786
- Thank you, Shawn.
- Awesome. Thank you.

1321
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:58,057
- Okay. You owe me 127.80.
- You said it was gonna be 200.

1322
01:13:58,233 --> 01:14:00,633
- I cut you a deal.
- Wow, Poppy. Thank you.

1323
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:02,634
That's actually human of you.

1324
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:04,966
Don't get all ABC Family
on me here, buddy.

1325
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,300
You're doing me a favor.

1326
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:10,002
I guaranteed Staples 45 seconds
of airtime, so cheat out to camera.

1327
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:12,079
And work this into your cheer:

1328
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:14,738
"Staples now carries 30-percent
recycled copy paper.

1329
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:17,477
Staples, committed to the
environment, committed to you. "

1330
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:18,677
- Hey.
- Okay.

1331
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:21,288
If I don't have the money,
it's my shoe in your ass.

1332
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:24,426
- That seems fair.
- You look great. Are you in love?

1333
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:28,487
Stay safe.

1334
01:14:31,433 --> 01:14:32,457
What's up, kid?

1335
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:34,101
- Downey.
- Good to have you back.

1336
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:37,966
Why didn't you tell me you're gay?
I'd have been totally okay with that.

1337
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:42,008
- Paint with all the colors of the wind.
- Wait. You're straight?

1338
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:46,847
Am I straight? Yes.

1339
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:48,380
But what about your diary?

1340
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:51,348
Then you asked for my beads
and stuck them in your mouth-

1341
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,182
- I thought it was a bracelet.
- A bracelet in your mouth?

1342
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:55,880
- I don't know.
- The closet door...

1343
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:57,958
...is made of all kinds of wood,
brother.

1344
01:14:58,126 --> 01:14:59,616
What?

1345
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:03,130
- All kinds.
- Okay.

1346
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:06,961
God, that is so awkward.

1347
01:15:10,706 --> 01:15:14,437
The Panthers, clear favorites,
have really come to play today.

1348
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:46,532
<i>Fierce, brave, hungry, Panthers</i>

1349
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:47,766
<i>Kill!</i>

1350
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:00,913
- Dude, they're kind of great.
- Yeah.

1351
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:02,681
It's not about them, guys.

1352
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:06,191
It's about us. Just stay focused.
We'll be fine.

1353
01:16:06,361 --> 01:16:07,385
Panthers out.

1354
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:17,371
Oh, let me get that for you.

1355
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:23,438
Drool much?

1356
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,343
Panthers out.

1357
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:42,056
Free paper, courtesy of Staples.
30-percent recycled copy paper.

1358
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:44,926
Staples, committed to the
environment, committed to you.

1359
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:46,998
Do you have
50-percent recycled paper?

1360
01:16:47,169 --> 01:16:50,969
No. But I have 50-percent recycled
asshole paper. It's in the men's room.

1361
01:16:51,139 --> 01:16:53,471
It's free, gay bar, just take it.

1362
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:55,109
Let's do this.

1363
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:56,376
- Tigers!
- Let's go. Let's go.

1364
01:16:56,411 --> 01:16:57,476
- Tigers!
- Let's go. Let's go.

1365
01:16:57,646 --> 01:17:01,241
Now, the Tigers from Gerald R. Ford
High School in Hinsdale, Illinois.

1366
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:04,842
This team historically ranks last
like their namesake president.

1367
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:07,318
Let's see if they've
stepped it up this year.

1368
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:10,287
Hey. Is this on TV?
Dude, this can't be on TV.

1369
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:13,792
Don't worry. It's NBC. No one
watches network television anymore.

1370
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:16,089
Look, it's Nick on TV, cheerleading.

1371
01:17:16,698 --> 01:17:18,859
Shawn too. They're cheerleaders.

1372
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:21,628
I thought those dudes
were in the kitchen.

1373
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:25,929
<i>All you chumps think you got poise
You prance around like little toys</i>

1374
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:27,405
Shit.

1375
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:29,372
My chickens.

1376
01:17:29,544 --> 01:17:31,341
Five, six, seven, eight.

1377
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:33,071
<i>Tigers!</i>

1378
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:58,001
Risky floor stunts, athletic tumbling,
tight formations.

1379
01:17:58,173 --> 01:18:01,370
Looks like the addition of those
two new guys is really paying off.

1380
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:06,675
Oh, my God, that bitch.

1381
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:12,047
- It's not totally her fault.
- I was talking about Dr. Dick.

1382
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:14,688
It sucks. Don't let it distract you.
We're gonna win.

1383
01:18:14,856 --> 01:18:17,188
No, we're not.
We're not as good as the others.

1384
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:19,691
Yeah, we are. And there's
one way we can prove it.

1385
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:25,765
- The Fountain of Troy.
- Yeah, right.

1386
01:18:25,934 --> 01:18:28,596
I thought that move
was prohibidimibidibabido.

1387
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,104
Remember Lennon?

1388
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:41,806
"Life's what happens when
you're busy making other plans. "

1389
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:44,884
- This is it. Life's happening.
- It's not that easy, Shawn.

1390
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:49,046
I never said it was. You can do it.
I know you can. I'll jump it with you.

1391
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:51,624
I still just don't see them
qualifying for States.

1392
01:18:51,793 --> 01:18:54,887
They are just not in the same league
as the top teams here.

1393
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:58,261
- Who's gonna catch me?
- Nick.

1394
01:18:58,433 --> 01:19:01,869
- Who's gonna catch you?
- Them.

1395
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:04,562
I have total faith in them.
They're Tigers.

1396
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:07,038
- But what if they don't?
- Bet big or go home.

1397
01:19:07,209 --> 01:19:09,200
You gotta risk it to get the biscuit.

1398
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:17,616
- We're doing it.
- You sure?

1399
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:19,253
We're doing a lot of talking.

1400
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,821
This seems like a lot
of talking during the routine.

1401
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,421
Lot of talking during the routine.

1402
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:29,857
I'm the fountain.
Shawn, base. Nick, back.

1403
01:19:30,031 --> 01:19:32,556
Girls, catch. Shawn,
double-back handspring to end it.

1404
01:19:32,734 --> 01:19:33,792
- Got it.
- Ready?

1405
01:19:33,969 --> 01:19:35,266
Break.

1406
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:47,403
Is this what I think it is? Are the Tigers
trying the Fountain of Troy?

1407
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:51,980
This is the most dangerous move
in cheerleading. OMG.

1408
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:53,710
That's prohibidado.

1409
01:19:54,389 --> 01:19:57,415
I told them in Spanish. How much
clearer could I have been?

1410
01:19:58,293 --> 01:19:59,419
Here comes the build.

1411
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:01,753
Nice.

1412
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:06,293
An awesome flying pose.

1413
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:14,472
Here it comes, the final fountain.

1414
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:21,139
And now for the final dismount.

1415
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:23,114
Yes.

1416
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:25,946
Perfect.

1417
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:27,681
And the final flip out.

1418
01:20:28,223 --> 01:20:29,622
Here it comes, and...

1419
01:20:30,225 --> 01:20:31,749
<i>Tigers!</i>

1420
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:44,770
Shawn!

1421
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:55,607
Tigers!

1422
01:21:02,157 --> 01:21:03,715
That little shit.

1423
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:05,449
My chicken shit.

1424
01:21:07,562 --> 01:21:10,053
Shawnzy. No, come here.
Come here, buddy. God.

1425
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:16,060
Hey.

1426
01:21:17,505 --> 01:21:18,529
Hey.

1427
01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:21,673
Did we win?
Are we going to States?

1428
01:21:21,843 --> 01:21:23,470
No, we came in 19th.

1429
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:26,004
I'm sorry.

1430
01:21:26,181 --> 01:21:29,173
Are you kidding? That's 10 places
better than we did last year.

1431
01:21:29,351 --> 01:21:31,945
If they didn't deduct points
for the Fountain of Troy...

1432
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:33,519
...we might've made top three.

1433
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:36,023
You nailed your triple backflip.

1434
01:21:36,191 --> 01:21:37,886
I nailed my double backflip...

1435
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:41,722
...because a triple backflip
would've landed me in the water.

1436
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:45,157
Yeah, I did do three.
That makes more sense.

1437
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:02,277
- What was that?
- About three weeks overdue.

1438
01:22:13,361 --> 01:22:15,022
What the hell are you doing?

1439
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:18,297
Kissing my teammate.

1440
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:22,698
You wanna die today? I can take life
just as fast as I can give it.

1441
01:22:22,871 --> 01:22:24,463
First of all, you're not a doctor.

1442
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:27,138
Second of all,
you're not my boyfriend.

1443
01:22:27,309 --> 01:22:29,140
What? Carly Fries, come on.

1444
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:32,602
You're dumping me for him?

1445
01:22:33,048 --> 01:22:34,413
No, I'm dumping you, period.

1446
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:39,519
And then I'm gonna be with him,
period. If that's okay with him.

1447
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:42,216
Question mark.

1448
01:22:42,424 --> 01:22:45,052
Totally. Exclamation point.

1449
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:48,623
Oh, puke.
Parentheses, bold, underline.

1450
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:54,735
Carly Horse. Carly's Jr., baby.
Larry, Moe and Carly.

1451
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:58,298
Carly and the Chocolate Factory,
sugar.

1452
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:02,533
Carlsbad, Carly-fornia.

1453
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:05,278
Why don't you run along now?

1454
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:07,472
The longer you watch,
the sadder it gets.

1455
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:09,674
- I'll show you sad.
- Hey, buddy.

1456
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:11,079
Oh, Jesus.

1457
01:23:11,252 --> 01:23:12,344
- Nick.
- Nick.

1458
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:16,553
That was for the Crocs.

1459
01:23:16,758 --> 01:23:19,386
You're not an old lady gardening
or a baby on the beach.

1460
01:23:19,561 --> 01:23:22,997
Okay? Now put on some shoes,
you're embarrassing yourself.

1461
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,229
I'm just saying.

1462
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:30,371
- You okay?
- Nothing a kiss can't fix.

1463
01:23:30,538 --> 01:23:32,165
Wait till tonight.

1464
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:37,067
I'm gonna make a wish on these
and throw them into the sky.

1465
01:23:40,081 --> 01:23:42,709
I hope one of you ends up
in my ER one day, bleeding...

1466
01:23:42,884 --> 01:23:45,250
...I'll make you wait for days.

1467
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,353
Unless one of you has Blue Cross...

1468
01:23:48,923 --> 01:23:52,017
...that's a PPO,
none of that HMO bullshit!

1469
01:23:56,398 --> 01:23:58,025
This is so cute.

1470
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:01,930
The 19th-placers.
You're like the littlest pigs.

1471
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:07,671
- How does it feel to still suck ass?
- You tell me.

1472
01:24:11,246 --> 01:24:15,012
Please don't hurt us. I was just kidding
about the whole rivalry thing.

1473
01:24:15,183 --> 01:24:18,209
Cheering doesn't mean that much
to me. I wanna be a paralegal.

1474
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:20,354
I love your hair. Go.
That bitch is crazy.

1475
01:24:20,522 --> 01:24:24,083
Way to go, Bianca.
I didn't know you had it in you.

1476
01:24:24,259 --> 01:24:26,557
There's a lot you don't know
about her.

1477
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:30,525
You know that John Lennon
"life happening"...

1478
01:24:30,698 --> 01:24:34,190
..."risk it to get the biscuit"
stuff you said back there?

1479
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:35,700
It didn't really make sense.

1480
01:24:35,870 --> 01:24:37,565
Well, it got you to do it.

1481
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:40,367
No. You got me to do it.

1482
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:51,910
Well, congratulations, kid.
You got what you wanted.

1483
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:54,778
Thanks to you.
I couldn't have done it without you.

1484
01:24:54,956 --> 01:24:57,754
- Just shut up. Shut up.
- Is it hard for you to accept thanks?

1485
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:00,326
- You want me to accept thanks?
- Yeah. Open up to me.

1486
01:25:00,495 --> 01:25:03,089
Here it comes from my mouth.
And you're welcome.

1487
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:06,463
Diora.

1488
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:08,465
Lose the clothes.

1489
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:13,869
That's good. No.

1490
01:25:15,643 --> 01:25:17,543
- Read me something from your diary.
- What?

1491
01:25:17,712 --> 01:25:22,149
"Perchance to dream,
perchance to love a wind- Hair...

1492
01:25:22,317 --> 01:25:25,878
- the summer skies
as teardrops cascade from my lo-"

1493
01:25:29,257 --> 01:25:31,282
Oh, my God. My husband.

1494
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,027
This is not what it looks like.

1495
01:25:34,195 --> 01:25:36,163
Looks like you're running
some naked drill.

1496
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:37,355
Exactly.

1497
01:25:37,532 --> 01:25:39,864
- Carry on.
- With what? Kissing your wife?

1498
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:42,434
Good one. Five, six, seven, eight.

1499
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:45,471
<i>I said, hey, Tigers! Yeah?
I said, hey, Tigers! Yeah?</i>

1500
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:47,198
Hold it.

1501
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:54,005
I'm gonna lay my hands on you to get
a really good sense of your movement.

1502
01:25:54,182 --> 01:25:55,740
Five, six, seven, eight.

1503
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:57,781
<i>- I said, hey, Tigers!
- Yeah!</i>

1504
01:25:57,952 --> 01:25:59,977
<i>- I said, hey, Tigers!
- Yeah!</i>

1505
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,680
<i>- What do we like to-?
- Panther meat!</i>

1506
01:26:02,891 --> 01:26:05,189
Sweet Jesus, mother of God!

1507
01:26:06,194 --> 01:26:09,561
I don't wanna run laps all afternoon.
I have a shrink appointment.

1508
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:12,666
Dude, your cousin stuck his finger
in your ass. Get over it.

1509
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:14,802
Dude, your dad put his wang
on your shoulder.

1510
01:26:14,969 --> 01:26:17,301
Dude, your mom gave you an HJ
and tipped you a dollar.

1511
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:19,633
Your cousin whacked you
in the face with his wang.

1512
01:26:19,807 --> 01:26:23,208
Come on, your cousin put his wiener
on your plate. You gotta get over it.

1513
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:25,642
Will you shut up, man?
I'm too straight to be gay.

1514
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:29,840
<i>I could watch What Not to Wear
with Nathan Lane in my blouse...</i>

1515
01:26:30,051 --> 01:26:32,076
...and still win a straight award.

1516
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:33,311
That's not right.

1517
01:26:33,488 --> 01:26:35,388
I could smoke pole
and still be straight.

1518
01:26:35,557 --> 01:26:37,718
- I can't say "smoke pole"?
- No.

1519
01:26:39,627 --> 01:26:41,254
Carly. Come here.

1520
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:44,125
We're working on a new mount
Bianca came up with.

1521
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:47,029
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1522
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,397
- We didn't order these.
- No shit, lesbatron.

1523
01:26:49,571 --> 01:26:52,472
No shit, Indigo Girl.
No shit, Lesbos, island of Greece.

1524
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:55,165
No shit, queer-leader.
No shit, Dixie Chick.

1525
01:26:55,343 --> 01:26:57,834
Wait, what? Just joking. Sorry.

1526
01:26:58,046 --> 01:26:59,946
The Fountain of Troy?

1527
01:27:00,114 --> 01:27:02,241
I thought that move
was prohibidabido.

1528
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:05,946
It's not prohibidabido?

1529
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:08,054
No, I'm pretty sure
it's prohibibabido.

1530
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:11,182
Cut.

1531
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:13,554
Go ahead and clap.

1532
01:27:14,329 --> 01:27:16,422
Mediocrity deserves applause.

1533
01:27:16,598 --> 01:27:19,726
Why don't we go find a Ford Focus
and clap around it?

1534
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:25,138
Mascot down!

1535
01:27:27,041 --> 01:27:28,804
It's a dragon!

1536
01:27:31,145 --> 01:27:32,544
Tell me about that road.

1537
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:38,182
Is it lonely on that road?

1538
01:27:44,025 --> 01:27:45,390
Have you made up your mind?

1539
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:50,860
- You gonna waste any more time?
- No!

1540
01:27:53,234 --> 01:27:54,292
Then here we go.

1541
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:11,208
- F-U!
- F-U!

1542
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:19,490
You're damn straight. F-U!

1543
01:29:55,823 --> 01:29:59,259
I can't take this head anymore.
Oh, the air feels so good.

1544
01:30:00,962 --> 01:30:02,293
All right, kiss me.

1545
01:30:03,664 --> 01:30:04,824
What are you doing?

1546
01:30:05,933 --> 01:30:07,901
Keep it on, sexy beast.

1547
01:30:22,717 --> 01:30:25,379
And that's how you kiss a guy.

1548
01:30:26,387 --> 01:30:27,376
Okay.

1549
01:30:27,555 --> 01:30:29,853
All right, again.
