1
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,800
The crew's crossing gantry for ingress.

2
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:47,900
Roger that.

3
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,510
Inspired by the late President Kennedy...

4
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,520
in only seven years, America has risen to the challenge of what he called.

5
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,380
"The most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure...

6
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,890
"on which man has ever embarked."

7
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,560
After trailing the Russians for years with our manned space program...

8
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,560
and after that sudden and horrible fire...

9
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,030
on the launch pad during a routine test...

10
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,900
that killed American astronauts Gus Grissom...

11
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,300
Ed White and Roger Chaffee...

12
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:22,040
there were serious doubts that we could beat the Russians to the moon.

13
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,140
JULY 20, 1969 HOUSTON, TEXAS But tonight, a mere 18 months after the tragedy of Apollo 1...

14
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,270
the entire world watched in awe as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin...

15
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,940
landed on the moon.

16
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,580
The big news came just a moment ago.

17
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,630
Mission Control gave the spacecraft permission...

18
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,560
to go for the extravehicular activity...

19
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,560
that is, for the walk on the moon...

20
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,290
far earlier than anticipated, 9.00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time...

21
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,400
The important thing when you penetrate the lunar module is your attitude...

22
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,940
and relative speed.

23
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,570
Let's say this is me here in the command module and this is you...

24
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,240
All right... in the LEM.

25
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,470
This thing sticking out here is called the probe.

26
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,480
Is that true? Absolutely.

27
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,150
Tracey, when you feel that thing slide in, everything's clicking...

28
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,080
it's like no other feeling in the world.

29
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,120
Some liquid propulsion. What's the occasion?

30
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,190
How's it going at Mission Control?

31
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,990
It's a nervous time. They're pacing around and smoking.

32
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,500
Gene Kranz is gonna have puppies. Jim Lovell.

33
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:22,790
This is Tracey.

34
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,770
How do you do? This is the man.

35
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,300
Gemini 7. Gemini 12. Apollo 8. They were the first around the moon.

36
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,870
This guy did 10 laps.

37
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,010
With one hand on the wheel. Make yourselves at home.

38
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,210
This is the last champagne in the city of Houston.

39
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,340
Very good. Everything else all right?

40
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,050
Everything's on course. Okay. Cadet Lovell.

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,960
Hey, Dad. Put this on ice. Make sure it gets cold.

42
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,050
You gonna get a haircut this week? I'm on vacation.

43
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,790
Get a haircut.

44
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,340
I wouldn't mind being up there tonight. God, who wouldn't.

45
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,810
Don't worry. Our day's coming.

46
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,540
They're not gonna cut the program before number 14.

47
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,010
You know, my cousin called.

48
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,250
Asked who we bribed to get on Jim Lovell's crew.

49
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,810
I told him they wanted to make sure he got the best.

50
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,020
Well, they got that right.

51
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,530
What network do we want?

52
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,360
Put on Walter!

53
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,920
Jules Bergman!

54
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,430
John, turn it up!

55
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,800
I really appreciate...

56
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,010
you all coming to this dress rehearsal party for my Apollo 12 landing.

57
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,710
Sit down, Conrad.

58
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,720
I think we should all take a moment to recognize...

59
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,520
the exemplary...

60
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,560
hell, damn near heroic effort...

61
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,920
displayed by Neil Armstrong's backup for this historic moon walk...

62
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,390
and, of course, his crew.

63
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,860
Let's hear it for Jim Lovell, Ken Mattingly and Fred Haise.

64
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,070
There he is! Everybody quiet down!

65
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,870
Hey! Kids!

66
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,670
You got a good picture?

67
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,870
We can verify the position of the opening I ought to have on the camera.

68
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,760
You think it's too late for him to abort? He still has time to get out.

69
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,590
He just needs somebody to wave him off. Pull up, Neil!

70
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,960
Pull up!

71
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,900
Neil, we can see you coming down the ladder now.

72
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,960
Look at those pictures.

73
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,840
I'm at the foot of the ladder.

74
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,410
The LEM footpads are only depressed in the surface about...

75
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,870
one or two inches.

76
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,510
It's almost like a powder.

77
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,520
Armstrong is on the moon.

78
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,020
Neil Armstrong, 38-year-old American...

79
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,150
standing on the surface of the moon...

80
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,590
on this July 20, 1969.

81
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,060
That's one small step for man...

82
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,300
one giant leap for mankind.

83
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,330
His quote was.

84
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,440
"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."

85
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,650
You're drunk, Lovell.

86
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,520
I'm not used to the champagne.

87
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,360
Me, neither.

88
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,900
I can't deal with cleaning up. Let's sell the house.

89
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,370
All right, let's sell the house.

90
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,740
They're back inside now looking up at us.

91
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,450
Isn't that something?

92
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,010
I bet Jannie Armstrong doesn't get a wink of sleep tonight.

93
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,550
When you were on the far side on 8, I didn't sleep at all.

94
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,250
I just vacuumed over and over again.

95
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,560
Christopher Columbus, Charles Lindbergh, and Neil Armstrong.

96
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,290
Neil Armstrong.

97
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,910
From now on, we live in a world where man has walked on the moon.

98
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,250
It's not a miracle.

99
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,820
We just decided to go.

100
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,290
On Apollo 8, we were so close...

101
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,450
just 60 nautical miles down and...

102
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,960
It was as if I could just...

103
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,470
step out and walk on the face of it.

104
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,170
I want to go back there.

105
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,690
Where's my mountain?

106
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,260
It's right up by the...

107
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,930
Do you see where the shadow crosses...

108
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,460
the white area there? That's the Sea of Tranquility...

109
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,830
and your mountain's on the edge of that.

110
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,700
It's your mountain, Marilyn. Mount Marilyn.

111
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,330
I don't see it.

112
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,340
Well, you gotta look harder.

113
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,280
You look harder...

114
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,850
while I...

115
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,130
Vehicle Assembly Building Cape Kennedy, Florida

116
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,070
The astronaut is the most visible member of a very large team.

117
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,330
OCTOBER 30, 1969

118
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,170
All of us, down to the guy sweeping the floor...

119
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,970
are honored to be a part of it.

120
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,840
What did the man say? "Give me a lever long enough and I'll move the world"?

121
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,680
That's what we're doing here. This is divine inspiration, folks.

122
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,650
It's the best part of each one of us, the belief that anything is possible.

123
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,030
Things like a computer that can fit into a single room...

124
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,520
and hold millions of pieces of information...

125
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,860
or the Saturn 5 rocket.

126
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,490
This is the actual launch vehicle that will be taking Alan Shepard...

127
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:33,530
and his crew on the first leg of the Apollo 13 mission.

128
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,330
When are you going up again, Jim?

129
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,070
I'm slated to be the commander of Apollo 14 sometime late next year.

130
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,110
If there is an Apollo 14.

131
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,020
People in my state have been asking why we're continuing...

132
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:53,790
to fund this program now that we've beaten the Russians to the moon.

133
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,230
Imagine if Christopher Columbus had come back from the New World...

134
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,290
and no one returned in his footsteps.

135
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,270
Attention, all personnel. Clear level 3.

136
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,100
Are there any other questions?

137
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,770
How do you go to the bathroom in space?

138
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,400
It's a highly technical process...

139
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,780
of cranking down the window and looking for a gas station which...

140
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,450
There's Deke Slayton.

141
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,120
You might be able to answer this lady's question.

142
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,960
Deke is one of the original Mercury 7 astronauts, ladies and gentlemen.

143
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,590
Now he's our boss. He hands out the astronauts' flight assignments...

144
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,730
so naturally we kick back part of our salaries to Deke.

145
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,830
How much this month? Can I have a minute? Something's come up.

146
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,630
Sure.

147
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,210
Hey!

148
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,840
Anybody home? I'm not being a cheerleader, Mom!

149
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,820
You don't understand! I worked so hard!

150
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,680
Maybe I don't understand...

151
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,450
but you are not wearing that out in this neighborhood.

152
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,150
She's not even wearing a bra! You can see everything!

153
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,520
Shut up!

154
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,360
Hey, everybody. Marilyn, trick or treat.

155
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:07,430
You know that Easter vacation trip we had planned for Acapulco?

156
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,770
I was thinking there might be a slight change in destination.

157
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,470
Really?

158
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,970
Maybe, say...

159
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:17,870
the moon.

160
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,880
Al Shepard's ear infection has flared up...

161
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,990
and we've all been bumped up to the prime crew of Apollo 13.

162
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,820
Straight to the head of the line and the Fra Mauro Highlands.

163
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,260
Six months? You're moving up six months?

164
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,260
Dad, can I please wear this?

165
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,590
Sure.

166
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,760
No! Absolutely not.

167
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,670
They're not rushing things, are they? You'll be ready in six months?

168
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,680
We'll be ready. I wouldn't want to be around Al Shepard tonight.

169
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,740
I gotta get over there and get up to speed on this.

170
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,240
Go.

171
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,110
I'm gonna walk on the moon, Marilyn.

172
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,450
I know. I can't believe it.

173
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,080
Naturally, it's 13. Why 13?

174
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,520
It comes after 12, hon.

175
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:14,590
Apollo 13, you are go for pyro arm and docking.

176
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,440
All systems are nominal and on the line.

177
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,940
MANNED SPACECRAFT CENTER HOUSTON, TEXAS S-4B is stable, SLA panels are drifting free.

178
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,980
3 MONTHS PRIOR TO LAUNCH The drogue is clear. The docking target is clear.

179
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,750
I'm coming up on that now. Two, one, mark.

180
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,920
Seventy-five feet. We're coming up on docking.

181
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,980
Let's shut down some thrusters on them. Let's see what he does.

182
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,290
Wait a minute.

183
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,960
I lost something here. I can't translate up.

184
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,900
Houston, we are drifting down and away.

185
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,070
Wanna back off and take another run? No, I got it.

186
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,940
Let me just try and get it stable here.

187
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,780
I'm gonna reset the high gain. I've got the target back in the reticle.

188
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,140
Okay, we're stable. Recycle the valves.

189
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,580
Forty feet. They're all gray.

190
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,480
Twenty.

191
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,120
Ten feet.

192
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,130
Capture. That's it!

193
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,320
That's it. Sweet move, Ken. Beautiful.

194
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,840
Gentlemen, that is the way we do that. Man, that woke me up.

195
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,100
Apollo 13 backup crew, you're up in the simulator.

196
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,110
Nice job, gentlemen. That's three hours of boredom...

197
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,340
followed by seven seconds of sheer terror.

198
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,880
Good job, guys. You just won the Christmas turkey.

199
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,620
Nice try, Frank.

200
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,690
You really outfoxed them.

201
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,520
Yeah, but it wasn't perfect. Used up too much fuel.

202
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,150
You're above the curve.

203
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,530
Not by much. Listen, guys, I wanna work it again.

204
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,470
We gotta be up with the dawn patrol headed for Bethpage at 0700.

205
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,370
Wheels up at 0700. Yeah, I know...

206
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,070
but my rate of turn is still a little slow there.

207
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,840
I really think we should work it again.

208
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,310
Let's get it right. Set it up again, Frank.

209
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,850
Okay, 13 backup crew. It'll have to wait.

210
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,410
Prime crew's up for another run.

211
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,490
Apollo 13, we show S-4B shutdown...

212
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,530
and all systems are nominal.

213
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,760
Fred, set the S-band omni to B...

214
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,600
and when you get in the LEM, to forward.

215
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,730
Good shape over here.

216
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,560
Hey, we got a problem.

217
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,240
Cabin depress. Repeat, cabin depress.

218
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:40,680
Ken, get your helmet on! I can't get it locked!

219
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,280
Houston, something ripped a big hole in us! We got rapid depress!

220
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,950
Oh, God!

221
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,250
I thought the stars would fall on you.

222
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,750
MARCH 23, 19703 WEEKS PRIOR TO LAUNCH

223
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,450
That's silly. Stars can't fall on us.

224
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,720
You're a smarter kid than I was.

225
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,460
How long will it take you to get to the moon?

226
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,760
Four days.

227
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,330
But that's pretty fast.

228
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,630
See, this is the Saturn 4B booster...

229
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,330
and it shoots us away from the Earth...

230
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:42,460
as fast as a bullet from a gun...

231
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:47,440
until the moon's gravity actually grabs us and pulls us...

232
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:52,010
into a circle around the moon...

233
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,680
which is called an orbit. All right?

234
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,760
Fred and I float down the tunnel into the lunar module...

235
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,790
this spidery-Iooking guy.

236
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,760
Only holds two people, and it's just for landing on the moon.

237
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,770
And I take the controls, steer it around...

238
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,830
and I fly it down...

239
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,500
adjusting it here, the attitude there, pitch, roll...

240
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,470
for a nice, soft landing on the moon.

241
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,250
Better than Neil Armstrong. Way better than Pete Conrad.

242
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,660
Did you know the astronauts in the fire?

243
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,720
Yeah. I knew the astronauts in the fire. All of them.

244
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,730
Could that happen again?

245
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,010
Well, I'll tell you something about that fire.

246
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,230
A lot of things went wrong.

247
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,540
The door.

248
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:57,610
It's called the hatch. They couldn't get it open when they needed to get out.

249
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,550
That was one thing.

250
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:04,560
A lot of things went wrong in that fire.

251
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,900
Did they fix it?

252
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,090
Yes, absolutely. We fixed it.

253
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,030
It's not a problem anymore.

254
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,740
I can't believe they still have you doing public appearances.

255
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,120
Well, Henry Hurt was all over me.

256
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,980
With a training schedule this tight, they shouldn't be asking.

257
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,460
It's the program, Marilyn. You know, it's NASA.

258
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,090
Hey, you're Jim Lovell, aren't you?

259
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,620
Hey! Lucky 13!

260
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,500
Right on!

261
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,270
That's the second time it's done that.

262
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,980
I was looking at the kids' school schedule coming up.

263
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,320
It's a very busy week.

264
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,260
I'm thinking about not going to the launch.

265
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,130
The kids need me at home.

266
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,830
Marilyn, we've had these kids for a while now.

267
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,540
They've never kept you from coming to the other launches.

268
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,980
But your mother just had this stroke.

269
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,350
Mom's fine.

270
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,850
It's not like I've never been to a launch.

271
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,350
The other wives have not done three.

272
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,950
I just don't think I can go through all that.

273
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,290
I'll just be glad when this one's over.

274
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,660
You're gonna miss a hell of a show.

275
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,640
Hey, guys. See you in a few weeks.

276
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,410
Take care. Bring us back a moon rock.

277
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,310
The number 13 doesn't bother you? Only if it's a Friday.

278
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,370
APRIL 7, 1970 CAPE KENNEDY, FLORIDA 4 DAYS PRIOR TO LAUNCH

279
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,910
Apollo 13, lifting off at 1300 hours and 13 minutes...

280
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,010
and entering the moon's gravity on April 13?

281
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,120
Ken Mattingly here has been doing some scientific experiments...

282
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,220
regarding that very phenomenon.

283
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,460
Yes, well, I had a black cat...

284
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,400
walk over a broken mirror...

285
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,900
under the lunar module ladder. It didn't seem to be a problem.

286
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,940
We're considering a letter we got...

287
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,240
which said we ought to take a pig with us for good luck.

288
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,740
Does it bother you that the public thinks this is routine?

289
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,750
There's nothing routine about flying to the moon. I can vouch for that.

290
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,780
I think that an astronaut's last mission...

291
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,550
his final flight is always very special.

292
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,160
Why is this your last, Jim?

293
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,730
I'm in command of the best ship...

294
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,790
with the best crew that anybody could ask for...

295
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,600
and I'll be walking in a place where there's 400 degrees difference...

296
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,940
between sunlight and shadow.

297
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,250
I can't imagine ever topping that.

298
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,690
APRIL 9, 19702 DAYS PRIOR TO LAUNCH

299
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,280
We have that scheduled for 0900 hours tomorrow.

300
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,350
That's not gonna work, Walter. Why?

301
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:03,490
Freddo and I are going over the lunar surface experiments tomorrow...

302
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,800
and Ken's gonna be back in the simulator. We're going over the flight plan tonight.

303
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,630
Gonna pay a visit to this machine after you're hard down.

304
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,210
Jim, we've got a problem.

305
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,640
We just got some blood work from the lab. Charlie Duke has the measles.

306
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,170
So we need a new backup.

307
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,020
You've all been exposed to it. I've had the measles.

308
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,990
Ken Mattingly hasn't.

309
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,920
You wanna break up my crew two days before the launch...

310
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:37,360
when we can predict each other's moves, read the tone of each other's voices?

311
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,900
Ken Mattingly will get seriously ill...

312
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:43,940
precisely when you and Haise will be ascending from the lunar surface.

313
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,770
That's a lousy time for a fever.

314
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,770
Jack Swigert has been out of the loop for weeks.

315
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,070
He's fully qualified to fly this mission.

316
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,010
He's a fine pilot, but when was the last time he was in a simulator?

317
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,180
I'm sorry, Jim. I understand how you feel.

318
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,190
We can do one of two things.

319
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:03,090
We can either scrub Mattingly and go with Swigert...

320
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,420
or we can bump all three of you to a later mission.

321
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,900
I've trained for the Fra Mauro Highlands...

322
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,070
and this is flight surgeon horseshit, Deke!

323
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,970
Jim, if you hold out for Ken, you will not be on Apollo 13.

324
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,940
It's your decision.

325
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,080
Let it ring.

326
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,280
Listen, I gotta take that.

327
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,050
Why? Because I'm on the backup crew...

328
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,920
and the backup crew has to set up the guest list and book the hotel rooms.

329
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,270
Yes, sir.

330
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,100
I understand.

331
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,560
Thank you, sir.

332
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,760
Damn.

333
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,000
Medical guys.

334
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,180
I had a feeling when they started doing all the blood tests that...

335
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,820
I mean, I know it's their ass if I get sick up there, but, I mean... Jesus!

336
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,700
Swigert, he'll be fine.

337
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,980
He's strong.

338
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,520
It'll be a hell of a mission. One for the books.

339
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,250
You sure about this? Why don't I talk to Deke?

340
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,660
I'm sure we can work this out.

341
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,200
This was my call.

342
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,010
Must've been a tough one.

343
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,020
Look, I don't have the measles.

344
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,590
I'm not gonna get the measles.

345
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,690
Ken, wait up.

346
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:07,570
Trajectory is holding steady. We're right on the line.

347
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,970
We're into program 64 at 0.05 G...

348
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,600
so we're feeling that gravity now.

349
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:17,440
Houston, we are at 400,000 feet passing entry interface.

350
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,650
About to lose signal.

351
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:23,280
Re-entry data is nominal, and we have radio blackout.

352
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,790
What's the story here?

353
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,960
I got a corridor light. We're coming in too shallow.

354
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,070
I'm going to manual.

355
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:43,410
Houston, switching to SCS. Roger, 13.

356
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,500
Okay, we're at three Gs.

357
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,480
Five Gs.

358
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,350
We're coming in too steep.

359
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:54,680
I'm gonna stay in this roll and see if I can pull us out.

360
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,680
We're at eight Gs.

361
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,750
Nine.

362
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,450
Ten.

363
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,630
We're at 12 Gs. 12 Gs. We're burning up.

364
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:08,630
Damn it!

365
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,970
I gave them a false indicator light at entry interface.

366
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,170
Even Mattingly didn't get it the first time.

367
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,270
How are you feeling, Freddo?

368
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,300
Charbroiled.

369
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,380
What happened?

370
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,780
Came in too steep. We're dead.

371
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:28,950
No shit.

372
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,050
We were into program 67 there.

373
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,400
We're gonna do this again, obviously.

374
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,060
Give us a minute to get our switches reset.

375
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,190
Jim, could we have a word?

376
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,310
Sure, Deke.

377
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:56,340
We're going to drop offline and debrief this one on our own.

378
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,590
If I had a dollar every time they killed me in this thing...

379
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,520
I wouldn't have to work for you, Deke.

380
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:15,530
Well, we have two days. We'll be ready.

381
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,530
Let's do it again.

382
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,770
Do it again.

383
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,690
Get down, Fred! Stephen, come here!

384
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,850
April 10, 1970 Night Before Launch

385
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,950
We can't go across that road.

386
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:42,090
We don't want Daddy to get our germs and get sick in outer space.

387
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,930
Hey, boys. Not giving your mom a hard time, are you?

388
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,200
Princess, you look beautiful.

389
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,720
That looks like Marilyn Lovell.

390
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:16,460
But it can't be. She's not coming to the launch.

391
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,760
I heard it was gonna be a hell of a show.

392
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,330
Who told you that?

393
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,090
Some guy I know.

394
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,810
You can't live without me.

395
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,340
Okay, folks. Let's say good night.

396
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,140
It's a big day tomorrow for the guys. Good night!

397
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,080
You hear about Ken?

398
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,740
Yeah.

399
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,300
April 11, 1970 Cape Kennedy, Florida

400
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,840
Stand back, please.

401
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,600
Guenter Wendt!

402
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,440
I wonder where Guenter went?

403
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:15,310
You walk on the moon, ja? Ja, we walk...

404
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,680
and we talk on the moon.

405
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,830
How do you feel? Pretty good?

406
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,870
Might be a little warmer in here.

407
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:33,300
How are you? Good.

408
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,070
Ready? Yeah.

409
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,590
God, no.

410
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,710
Oxygen purge system. Check.

411
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,750
Helmet restraint ring. Check.

412
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,960
Communication umbilical on.

413
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,890
Fred. What?

414
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,440
Gum. Sorry.

415
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,530
Thanks.

416
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,270
I'm gonna give these guys a beautiful ride.

417
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,900
I'm sure you will, Jack.

418
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,560
You need more air?

419
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,480
You want some apple?

420
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,250
I hate this already.

421
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,290
You're not just about to pop, are you?

422
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:31,080
No. I got 30 days till this blasts off.

423
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,660
MISSION CONTROL HOUSTON, TEXAS

424
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,400
This is for Gene.

425
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,510
Mrs. Kranz has pulled out the needle and thread again.

426
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,910
The last one looked like he bought it off a gypsy.

427
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:28,210
Well, you can't argue with tradition.

428
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,880
Copy that.

429
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,920
This is from your wife, Gene.

430
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,980
Thank you, Tom.

431
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,580
I was starting to get worried.

432
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,220
There we go.

433
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:44,030
I like that one. Sharp.

434
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,810
Jim, you're all set.

435
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,580
Very sharp.

436
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,750
Gene, I guess we can go now.

437
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:16,230
Save it for splashdown, guys.

438
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,450
Apollo 13 flight controllers, listen up.

439
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,050
Give me a "go, no go" for launch.

440
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,350
Booster. Go.

441
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,520
RETRO. Go.

442
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,060
FIDO. We're go, Flight.

443
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,290
Guidance. Go.

444
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,730
Surgeon. Go, Flight.

445
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,850
EECOM.

446
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,790
We're go, Flight. GNC.

447
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,160
TELMU. Go.

448
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,220

00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,500
Procedures. INCO. Go.

450
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,830
FAO. We are go.

451
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,140
Network. Recovery. Go.

452
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,370
CAPCOM. We're go, Flight.

453
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,310
Launch control, this is Houston. We are go for launch.

454
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,180
Roger that, Houston.

455
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,150
Launch Control Center Cape Kennedy, Florida

456
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,740
Pad leader, what's your status?

457
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,720
We are go for launch.

458
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,220
T minus 60 seconds and counting.

459
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,810
Stand by. Roger.

460
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,700
Fuel pumps.

461
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,540
This is it. A few bumps and we're hauling the mail.

462
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:17,210
Control, this is Guidance. We're ready for takeoff.

463
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,980
We are go for launch.

464
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,710
T minus...

465
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,690
fifteen, fourteen...

466
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:29,180
thirteen, twelve, eleven...

467
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,660
ten, nine...

468
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,130
eight, seven...

469
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,860
six.

470
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,630
Ignition sequence starts.

471
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,400
Three, two, one.

472
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,570
Ignition!

473
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,730
The clock is running!

474
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,840
We have lift-off!

475
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,690
LAUNCH Houston, we have cleared the tower at 13.13.

476
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,590
Okay, guys, we got it.

477
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,590
Come on, baby.

478
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:59,560
Altitude is on the line.

479
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,540
Velocity right on the line.

480
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:06,110
Roll complete. We are pitching.

481
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,420
13, stand by for Mode One Bravo.

482
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,750
FIDO, how we looking?

483
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,460
Looks good, Flight. Right down the middle.

484
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,560
We see your BPC is clear, 13.

485
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,970
Roger. EDS to manual.

486
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,800
Inboard.

487
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,800
Get ready for a little jolt, fellas.

488
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,480
That was some little jolt.

489
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,330
Tower jett.

490
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:08,940
Houston, we've got a center engine cut-off. Go on the other four.

491
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,010
Roger that, 13. We show the same.

492
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,310
Booster, can you confirm that cut-off?

493
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:20,820
Roger. Looks like we lost it. FIDO, what'll that do to us?

494
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,450
Stand by, Flight.

495
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:25,820
I need to know if the IUs are correcting for the number five shutdown.

496
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,200
Houston, what's the story on engine five?

497
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,670
We're still go. We'll be all right as long as we don't lose another one.

498
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,310
Roger that. We're not sure why the inboard was out...

499
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,880
but the other engines are go, so we're gonna burn those engines...

500
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,820
a little bit longer.

501
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,360
Roger that. Our gimbals are good.

502
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,690
Our trim is good.

503
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,530
Looks like we just had our glitch for this mission.

504
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,580
13, stand by for staging. Roger that.

505
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,440
S-2 shutdown. S-4B ignition.

506
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,280
Thrust looks good, Flight.

507
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:27,050
Flight, S-4B cut-off in 10 seconds.

508
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:31,460
13, this is Houston. Predicted cut-off is 12 plus 34, over.

509
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,760
Coming up on 12 minutes, 34.

510
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,800
And...

511
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,370
SECO!

512
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,970
Shutdown.

513
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,400
And that, gentlemen, is how we do that.

514
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,430
Oh, boy. Hope I can sleep.

515
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,300
Mom, that was loud.

516
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,470
Here, hold my hand.

517
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,100
I can't believe you did this four times.

518
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,610
The worst part's over.

519
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,910
It is?

520
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:31,690
Listen, this doesn't stop for me until he lands on that aircraft carrier.

521
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,960
Well, you just look so calm about it.

522
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:38,150
If the flight surgeon had to okay me for this mission, I'd be grounded.

523
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,020
Mrs. Haise! Can we speak to you?

524
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,760
Can we just have a word with you, please?

525
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:47,100
Remember, you're proud, happy, and thrilled.

526
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:50,360
How're you feeling? Very proud...

527
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,670
and very happy, and we're thrilled.

528
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:59,280
Flight, Booster. I show S-4B shutdown.

529
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:02,480
TLI is on the money. Looks good, Flight.

530
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,050
Roger, FIDO.

531
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,490
We're going to the moon!

532
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,030
We have reacquisition of signal at Hawaii.

533
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:14,120
Flight, everything looks good.

534
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,570
Okay, Houston. CMP here.

535
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,970
I've exchanged couches with Jim. I'm in the pilot's seat.

536
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,300
I'm gonna go ahead and get set for transposition and docking.

537
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,470
Roger that, Jack.

538
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:42,180
Freddo, you okay?

539
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:49,360
Everybody, let's get turned around and pick up the lunar module.

540
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:52,090
Odyssey, you're go for pyro arm and docking...

541
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,870
and we recommend you secure cabin pressurization.

542
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,100
Roger that.

543
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,910
Okay, we're ready for CSM separation.

544
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,510
Okay, SMRCS isol valves are all gray.

545
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,410
Okay, Swigert, command module pilot.

546
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,450
She's all yours.

547
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,590
Houston, we've got a good separation.

548
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,430
The S-4B is stable. Translation looks good.

549
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,860
Reconfirm then, 13. We're gonna start to pitch around...

550
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,870
to line up with the LEM.

551
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,030
You know, Freddo, Frank Borman...

552
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:33,140
was upchucking most of the way to the moon on Apollo 8.

553
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:37,300
I'm all right. I just ate too much breakfast. Let's go to work.

554
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,380
And pitching up.

555
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,610
Pitch rate, 2.5 degrees per second.

556
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,640
Roger, Jack.

557
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,750
We see you pitching around.

558
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,480
Keep an eye on that telemetry.

559
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:53,960
Roger that. If Swigert can't dock this thing, we don't have a mission.

560
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,120
How's the alignment? GDC align.

561
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:05,070
Thrusting forward.

562
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,670
One hundred feet.

563
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,940
Watch the alignment now.

564
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,850
Don't worry, guys.

565
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,660
I'm on top of it.

566
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:34,030
FIDO, let me know when you're ready.

567
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,540
Let's uplink that.

568
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:40,300
How we looking? We're not there yet. Forty feet.

569
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,670
Twenty.

570
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,840
Come on, rookie, park that thing.

571
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,560
Ten feet.

572
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,400
Capture.

573
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:12,170
That's it.

574
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,540
Talk back is barber pole. Go ahead and retract.

575
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:21,210
Houston, we have hard dock.

576
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,220
Roger, we understand. That's a good deal, Jack.

577
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,880
Let's start back up with procedure 17.

578
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,990
Houston, we have LEM extraction.

579
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:32,750
We copy that, 13.

580
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,360
Now you're off to the Fra Mauro Highlands.

581
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:39,090
I gotta get out of this suit. Houston, we are ready...

582
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,400
for the beginning of the PTC...

583
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,740
and I think once we're in that barbecue roll, Jack and I will eat.

584
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,710
Hey, I'm hungry. Are you sure?

585
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,900
I could eat the ass out of a dead rhinoceros.

586
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:58,350
We got a smooth one? By the numbers so far.

587
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:01,390
We just ran a minimum load test on the cooling system...

588
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,390
See you tomorrow. Take care.

589
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,230
DAY 3 APRIL 13

590
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:22,800
It's too bad we can't demonstrate this on TV.

591
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:24,800
What a shame.

592
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,220
Overboard dump coming up.

593
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:39,050
Here it comes...

594
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,130
the constellation Urion.

595
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:47,260
Now, that's a beautiful sight.

596
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:51,240
Barbara, we are going to your father's broadcast.

597
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,570
No! I'm never coming out!

598
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,300
I hate Paul! No one else can ever play their records again!

599
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:01,750
She's still going on about the stupid Beatles breaking up?

600
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:04,450
They're not stupid! You're stupid!

601
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,750
I know you're mourning.

602
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,420
I'm not going, Mom! Dad won't know if we're there!

603
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:13,120
The whole world is going to be watching this broadcast, and so are we.

604
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,520
Good evening, America...

605
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:21,160
and welcome aboard Apollo 13.

606
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,630
I'm Jim Lovell, and we're broadcasting to you tonight...

607
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:29,470
from an altitude of almost 200,000 miles...

608
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,440
away from the face of the Earth...

609
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:35,280
and we have a pretty good show in store for you tonight.

610
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:37,680
We are going to show you just what...

611
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:40,620
life is like for the three of us here...

612
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,820
in the vast expanse of outer space.

613
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:46,830
One of the first things we'd like to do...

614
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,190
is provide you with the appropriate background music.

615
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,560
So, hit it there, Freddo.

616
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:13,490
That was supposed to be the theme to 2001...

617
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,050
in honor of our command module, Odyssey.

618
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,860
There seems to have been a last-minute change in the program.

619
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:25,030
When I go up on 19, I'm gonna take my entire collection of Johnny Cash along.

620
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,200
Hey, Marilyn. Where's their broadcast?

621
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:34,270
All the networks dumped us.

622
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,400
One said we made going to the moon...

623
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:38,780
as exciting as a trip to Pittsburgh.

624
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:43,010
My son's supposed to be on.

625
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:45,180
He's in outer space.

626
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:50,120
This is all the channels we get, Mrs. Lovell.

627
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:53,960
It's that damn TV Guide again.

628
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,460
Ruthless porters.

629
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:59,190
Savage baggage masters...

630
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:15,310
Do they know they're not on the air?

631
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:18,280
We'll tell them when they get back.

632
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,060
If anyone from the IRS is watching...

633
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:29,660
I forgot to file my 1040 return.

634
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:31,820
I meant to do it today...

635
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:34,270
That's no joke. They'll jump on him.

636
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,900
Well, folks, let's head on down to the lunar excursion module.

637
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,310
Follow me.

638
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:44,000
When we get ready to land on the moon...

639
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:48,340
Fred Haise and I will float through this access tunnel...

640
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:50,420
into the lunar module, leaving...

641
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:53,580
EECOM, that stir's gonna be...

642
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:56,780
on both H2 and both O2 tanks, is that correct?

643
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,750
The spacecraft will remain connected.

644
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,460
Well, folks, as you can probably tell...

645
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:07,700
the Aquarius isn't much bigger than a couple of telephone booths.

646
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:10,670
The skin of the LEM in some places...

647
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:12,260
is only as...

648
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:15,370
as thick as a couple of layers...

649
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,940
of tinfoil, and that's all that protects us from the vacuum of space.

650
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:23,810
We get away with this because the LEM is designed only for flight in outer space.

651
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:26,950
Fred Haise, Renaissance man.

652
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:32,490
We'll head back up the tunnel now and back into the Odyssey.

653
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:41,260
All right, we've returned to the...

654
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:44,170
Stand by one, Houston.

655
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:46,140
Gotcha!

656
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:51,200
Houston, that bang you heard was Fred Haise on the cabin repress valve.

657
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:54,210
He gets our hearts going every time with that one.

658
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,890
We're about to close out the Aquarius...

659
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,220
and return to the Odyssey.

660
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:09,290
Our next broadcast will be from Fra Mauro on the surface of the moon.

661
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:14,130
So, this is the crew of the Apollo 13...

662
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:17,390
wishing everyone back on Earth...

663
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,640
a pleasant evening.

664
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,480
All right.

665
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,180
Daddy was funny.

666
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:33,020
They might air a few minutes on the news tonight.

667
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:34,680
You'd think so.

668
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:37,580
Bye.

669
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:42,190
Well, between Jack's back taxes and the Fred Haise show...

670
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:46,260
I'd say that was a pretty successful broadcast.

671
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,270
That was an excellent show.

672
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:49,770
Thank you very much, Houston.

673
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:52,070
We've got a couple of housekeeping procedures.

674
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:56,740
We'd like you to roll right to 0-6-0 and null your rates.

675
00:49:57,110 --> 00:50:00,280
Roger that. Rolling right, 0-6-0.

676
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:09,020
And then if you could give your oxygen tanks a stir.

677
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:11,260
Roger that.

678
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,890
We've got a problem here.

679
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,130
What did you do? Nothing. I stirred the tanks.

680
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:58,430
This is Houston. Say again, please.

681
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:00,070
Houston, we have a problem.

682
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,940
We have a main bus B undervolt.

683
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,180
We've got a lot of thruster activity. What's with the computer?

684
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,510
It just went off line. There's another master alarm.

685
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:13,020
Checking the quad. It was no repress valve.

686
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:16,020
Maybe it's in quad C. I'll reconfigure the RCS.

687
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:18,190
We've got a ping light.

688
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:22,130
We've got multiple caution and warnings. We've got to reset and restart.

689
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,990
I'm going to SCS.

690
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,630
Flight, their heart rates are skyrocketing.

691
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:33,370
EECOM, what's your data telling you? O2 tank two not reading at all.

692
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,970
Tank one is at 725 psi and falling.

693
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:39,810
Fuel cells one and three are...

694
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:43,220
What's going on? Flight, let me get back to you.

695
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,220
Flight, GNC. They're all over the place.

696
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:49,480
They keep going close to gimbal lock. I keep losing radio signal.

697
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,530
Their antennae must be flipped around.

698
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:55,120
They'll have to do it manually, if at all. One at a time, people.

699
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:59,130
Is this an instrumentation problem or real power loss?

700
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:02,060
It's reading a quadruple failure. That can't happen.

701
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:04,110
It's got to be instrumentation.

702
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:06,730
Get the hatch plugged. A meteor may have hit the LEM.

703
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:09,810
The tunnel's really torquing with all this movement.

704
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:14,150
Houston, we had a pretty large bang associated with a master alarm.

705
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,050
Shit, it's main bus A.

706
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:20,250
Main bus A undervolt? Main bus A undervolt down to...

707
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:24,890
It's reading 25-and-a-half. Main bus B is reading zip now.

708
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:27,320
We got a wicked shimmy up here.

709
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,090
These guys are talking about bangs and shimmies.

710
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,060
Doesn't sound like instrumentation.

711
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:34,660
You're breaking up. This hatch won't seal.

712
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:39,230
Just stow it. If we'd been hit by a meteor, we'd be dead by now.

713
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,430
I'm gonna try to get us out of this.

714
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:44,070
Houston, did you say switch to omni bravo?

715
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:47,170
Roger that, 13. The signal strength went way down.

716
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:50,780
It's fighting me. What's the story? We keep flirting with gimbal lock.

717
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:54,450
We need a confirmation. What systems are down?

718
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:58,950
SMRCS, Helium one...

719
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:01,260
A and C are barber pole.

720
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,430
Houston, I'm switching over Quad C to main A.

721
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:05,590
Roger that, 13.

722
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:08,800
Okay, Houston, fuel cell one, fuel cell three.

723
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:13,740
We got a main bus B undervolt, cryo pressure, suit compressor.

724
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:18,310
What don't we have? AC bus one, AC bus two.

725
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:21,880
Command module computer. O 2 flow high.

726
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,480
It may be a caution and warning failure.

727
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:28,960
Houston, we are venting something out into space.

728
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:34,090
I can see it outside window one right now.

729
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:39,960
It's definitely a gas of some sort.

730
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,760
It's got to be the oxygen.

731
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,750
Roger, Odyssey. We copy your venting.

732
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:08,460
Give me an alignment. Think about things we can connect.

733
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,000
Let's start back at the beginning.

734
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:25,840
Listen up. Quiet down, people.

735
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,410
Quiet down!

736
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:32,480
Let's stay cool, people.

737
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:35,460
Procedures, I need another computer up in the RTCC.

738
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,020
I want everybody to alert your support teams.

739
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:40,860
Wake up anybody you need and get them in here.

740
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,300
Let's work the problem, people.

741
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:45,660
Let's not make things worse by guessing.

742
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:49,970
13, this is Houston. We're going around the room. We'll get you answers.

743
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,000
We keep venting, we're gonna keep hitting the edge of that deadband.

744
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,570
Take a look at the O2 on number one.

745
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,210
200 pounds and falling.

746
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,210
O2 tank two still zero.

747
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:09,810
218 psi and falling. Is that what you have? Confirm.

748
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:14,660
We're seeing the same, 13. Can we review our status, Sy?

749
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:18,890
Let's look at this thing from a standpoint of status.

750
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:26,370
What have we got on the spacecraft that's good?

751
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:30,870
I'll get back to you, Gene.

752
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:34,880
We're not gonna have power much longer.

753
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:37,520
The ship's bleeding to death.

754
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:47,450
Flight? Yeah. Go, EECOM.

755
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:52,360
Flight, I recommend we shut down the reactant valves of the fuel cells.

756
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,230
What the hell good is that gonna do?

757
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:58,740
If the leak's there, we can isolate it.

758
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:02,470
We can save what's left in the tanks, and run on the good cell.

759
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:07,040
You close them, you can't open them again. You can't land on the moon with one cell.

760
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:10,210
Gene, the Odyssey is dying.

761
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:13,790
From my chair here, this is the last option.

762
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:23,820
Yeah. Okay, Sy.

763
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:42,610
Capcom, let's have them close the reactant valves.

764
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:44,680
13, this is Houston.

765
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:50,010
We want you to close react valves on cells one and three. Do you copy?

766
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:54,620
Are you saying you want the whole smash?

767
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:58,330
Closing down the react valves for fuel cells shutdown?

768
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,440
Shutting down the fuel cells? Did I hear you right?

769
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,130
Yeah, they heard me right.

770
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:09,430
Tell them we think that's the only way they can stop the leak.

771
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:10,810
Yeah, Jim...

772
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,280
we think that closing the react valves may stop the leak.

773
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:27,150
Did he copy that? Do you copy, Jim?

774
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,300
Yes, Houston, we copy.

775
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,970
We just lost the moon.

776
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,880
Okay, Freddo, shut those down.

777
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:54,750
Let's see what this does.

778
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:05,160
If this doesn't work...

779
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,390
we're not gonna have enough power left to get home.

780
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:28,550
Shit! God damn it!

781
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,890
Houston, O2 on one is still falling.

782
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,560
How long does it take to power up the LEM?

783
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:39,760
Three hours by the checklist.

784
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:42,130
We don't have that much time.

785
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:43,800
Shit!

786
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:48,780
Jack, before the batteries completely die on us in here...

787
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,470
let's power down everything so we can save as much as we can for re-entry.

788
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:58,240
Fifteen minutes of oxygen, that's it. The command module will be dead.

789
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:01,120
Okay, guys, listen up. Here's the drill.

790
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,390
We're moving the astronauts to the LEM.

791
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:05,150
We've got to get oxygen up there.

792
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:09,130
TELMU, Control, I want emergency power procedure. Essential hardware only.

793
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:13,500
GNC, EECOM, we'll be shutting down the command module at the same time.

794
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,470
We've to transfer the guidance system to another computer.

795
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:19,400
I want those numbers up and ready when they're in position.

796
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:23,770
Transfer all data over the LEM computer before the command module dies.

797
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:26,080
The lunar module just became a lifeboat.

798
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:30,310
Odyssey, this is Houston. We need you to power down immediately.

799
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:34,140
Power up the LEM at the same time, so get somebody over there.

800
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:36,660
We already have Freddo in the LEM.

801
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,820
We've got serious time pressure.

802
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:41,490
Get the guidance program transferred...

803
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,160
before you're out of power in the command module...

804
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:46,800
or you're not gonna be able to navigate.

805
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:48,870
How much time? Can you give me a number?

806
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:53,170
We're looking at less than 15 minutes of life support in the Odyssey.

807
00:59:56,610 --> 01:00:00,270
We've got 15 minutes, Freddo. It's worse than I thought.

808
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:05,850
Houston, I've moved from the command module into the LEM.

809
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:10,520
If Jack can't get that data transferred before they go dead...

810
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:12,890
They won't know which way they're pointed.

811
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:15,690
That's a bad way to fly. I'll be in 210 if you need me.

812
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:21,060
Houston, this is 13. Are you back with me now?

813
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:26,470
Aquarius, this is Houston. You now have about 12 minutes to power up.

814
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:30,910
I can't see any stars. Man, there's a lot of debris floating around out there.

815
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,180
Houston, I have completed the steps on Page 15.

816
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:37,220
I'm ready to power down the computer.

817
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:42,890
I'm gonna need your gimbal angles, Jack, before you shut down the computer!

818
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,480
Okay, Jim.

819
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,530
I need this back before they power down.

820
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:49,030
All right, I got it. Hold on.

821
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:53,230
Houston, our computer is up. Roger. Stand by.

822
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:58,370
Jack, we need to proceed with steps 12 through 17 quickly.

823
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:01,880
You're down to about eight minutes remaining.

824
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:05,540
Fuel cell pump's off. O2 fans, tank two off.

825
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:09,680
Okay, Houston, check me. I have completed the gimbal conversions...

826
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:13,080
but I need a double check of the arithmetic.

827
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:17,680
Yeah, you can go, Jim. The roll CAL angle is minus two.

828
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:21,350
Lunar module roll is 355.57.

829
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:24,930
Pitch. 1678, correction.

830
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:27,930
Pitch.167. 78.

831
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,600
Yaw is 351.87.

832
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:32,230
Stand by. We're checking it.

833
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:34,780
We've got negative visibility in our star field...

834
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:39,470
and if this paperwork isn't right, who knows where we'll end up out here.

835
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:47,950
Looks good, Flight.

836
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:50,390
It's all right. Good here.

837
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,790
He's good, Andy. We'll go on those numbers.

838
01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:54,490
You're good. Log them in.

839
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,890
Turn off the IMU. Switch to SCS.

840
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:59,400
Stand by. Over.

841
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:03,000
It's a great day in New York. It's girl watchers' weather.

842
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:06,300
I like the ingenious girl watchers who wear Con Edison helmets...

843
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:10,070
and dig trenches in the street to get a better view.

844
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,340
But speaking of girl watching...

845
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:15,970
did you know that our first bachelor astronaut is on his way to the moon?

846
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,580
Is it Swigert? Yeah, first bachelor.

847
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:22,920
They say he's the kind who has a girl in every port. He has that reputation.

848
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:27,430
He's sort of foolishly optimistic, taking nylons and Hershey bars to the moon.

849
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,960
Did you read that three million...

850
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:34,700
What do you say? Less viewers or fewer viewers?

851
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:38,290
Three million fewer viewers...

852
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,700
watched the space shot than did the last one.

853
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:49,310
Here is ABC science editor Jules Bergman.

854
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:53,650
The Apollo 13 spacecraft has lost all electrical power...

855
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:56,450
astronauts Jim Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert...

856
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,050
are making their way to the lunar module...

857
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,890
using it as a lifeboat so they'll have electrical power...

858
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,830
for their radios on the command module.

859
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,830
Apollo 13 is apparently also losing breathing oxygen...

860
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:10,200
Slow down. An "electrical failure." What exactly does that mean?

861
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:13,210
The emergency ruled out a lunar landing...

862
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:16,000
and could endanger the lives of the astronauts...

863
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:20,170
if the LEM oxygen supply, plus whatever is left of the command module's oxygen...

864
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:22,650
can't last them until they can get back to Earth.

865
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,480
What do you mean, "no immediate danger"?

866
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:27,350
I heard they're losing oxygen. Can they get back?

867
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:31,050
The LEM's descent rocket engine will be used to abort the mission...

868
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,320
and get them safely back to Earth.

869
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,250
Recapping what has happened.

870
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:38,360
The Apollo 13 astronauts may be in grave danger.

871
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:40,200
No, don't give me that NASA bullshit!

872
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:42,700
I want to know what's happening with my husband!

873
01:03:42,770 --> 01:03:44,830
We want to switch control to Aquarius.

874
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:46,600
Roger that. Houston, wait!

875
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:49,440
You're down to about five minutes now.

876
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:54,700
Be aware our RCS isn't up here yet. We have no attitude control on Aquarius.

877
01:03:55,850 --> 01:03:58,550
They don't have control? Did we miss a step here?

878
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:02,750
Control, what the hell happened? I don't know. We need more time.

879
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:07,620
We're out of whack.

880
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:10,250
I'm trying to pitch down. We're yawing to the left.

881
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:12,200
Why can't I null this out?

882
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:15,260
She wasn't designed to fly attached like this.

883
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,400
It's like flying with a dead elephant on our back.

884
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:22,070
Flight, Guidance. We're getting close to center here.

885
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:25,480
Watch that middle gimbal. We don't want you tumbling off into space.

886
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:28,280
Inform them I'm well aware of the goddamn gimbals!

887
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:31,710
Roger that. I don't need to hear the obvious.

888
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:33,380
I can see the frapping eight-ball!

889
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:34,920
Andy, we're on VOX.

890
01:04:34,990 --> 01:04:37,920
Aquarius, this is Houston. We've got you both on VOX.

891
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:40,150
You want us to go to VOX?

892
01:04:40,430 --> 01:04:43,490
You have a hot mike. We are reading everything you say.

893
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:45,100
Sorry, Jim.

894
01:04:47,170 --> 01:04:49,260
It's only by a very narrow margin...

895
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:53,300
that we're going to get Lovell, Haise and Swigert back alive.

896
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:59,080
I'm sorry. Jeffrey's calling for you.

897
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:03,110
The terseness of Kraft and the grim lines of Jim McDivitt.

898
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:07,650
This has been a very close call. We're not out of the woods yet.

899
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:17,590
Why are so many people here?

900
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,300
Your dad's flying his mission.

901
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:29,170
He said he was going to get me a moon rock.

902
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,470
Right.

903
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,650
Something broke on your daddy's spaceship...

904
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:44,920
and he's gonna have to turn around before he even gets to the moon.

905
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,900
Was it the door?

906
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:55,730
13, we still show that venting pushing you around.

907
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,360
How you doing? Houston, Aquarius.

908
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:03,640
We've had to learn how to fly all over again, but we are doing better now.

909
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:07,640
Roger that, Aquarius. Have him close it out.

910
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:11,150
Jack, we can close out your procedure now.

911
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:16,660
Do we know for sure that we can power this thing back up?

912
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:19,850
It's gonna get awfully cold in here.

913
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:23,890
Copy that, Jack. We'll just have to deal with that later.

914
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:29,430
Computer off. We're clear.

915
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:31,900
We're going to the LEM.

916
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:34,700
We confirm shutdown, Jack.

917
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:36,770
Lunar module now in control.

918
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:45,910
Roger that, Houston. This is Odyssey signing off.

919
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,900
Freddo, we're gonna have to execute some sort of burn.

920
01:07:05,110 --> 01:07:07,040
It's just a matter of when.

921
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,250
Did they shut us all down in there? Yeah.

922
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:18,620
Didn't think we'd be back in here so soon.

923
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:23,890
Houston, how far off course do you project we are? Over.

924
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:29,430
Okay, people, listen up!

925
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:32,800
Gentlemen, I want you all to forget the flight plan.

926
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:37,300
From this moment on, we are improvising a new mission.

927
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:43,170
Sorry about that. We'll get somebody to look at that.

928
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:45,810
How do we get our people home?

929
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:49,580
They are here.

930
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,520
Do we turn them around, direct abort? Yes!

931
01:07:56,290 --> 01:07:59,320
No, sir! We get them on a free-return trajectory.

932
01:07:59,430 --> 01:08:02,160
It's the option with the fewest question marks for safety.

933
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:05,360
I agree. We use the moon's gravity to slingshot them around.

934
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:09,130
No, the LEM will not support three guys for that amount of time.

935
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:13,830
I think we've got to do a direct abort. We do an about-face, bring the guys right home.

936
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:15,530
Get them back soon. Absolutely.

937
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:18,110
We don't even know if the Odyssey's engine's working.

938
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:21,810
If there's been serious damage to the craft... They blow up and they die!

939
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:24,320
That is not the argument! We're talking about time!

940
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:27,510
Not whether these guys... I'm not gonna sugarcoat this for you!

941
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:30,060
Okay, hold it. Let's hold it down.

942
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:33,560
The only engine we've got with enough power for a direct abort...

943
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:35,720
is the SPS on the service module.

944
01:08:35,830 --> 01:08:38,390
It could have been damaged in an explosion...

945
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,130
so let's consider that engine dead.

946
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,290
We light it up, could blow the whole works.

947
01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:44,900
Just too risky. We're not gonna take that chance.

948
01:08:45,010 --> 01:08:47,700
The only thing the command module's good for is re-entry.

949
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:51,510
That leaves us with the LEM, which means free-return trajectory.

950
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,010
Once we get the guys around the moon...

951
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,380
we'll fire up the LEM engine, make a long burn...

952
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:59,210
pick up some speed, and get them home as quick as we can.

953
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:02,980
Gene, I'm wondering what the Grumman guys think about this.

954
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:07,360
We can't make any guarantees. We designed the LEM to land on the moon...

955
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:09,900
not fire the engine for course corrections.

956
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,870
Well, unfortunately, we're not landing on the moon, are we?

957
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:19,170
I don't care what anything was designed to do. I care about what it can do.

958
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:22,610
So let's get to work. Let's lay it out, okay?

959
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:26,840
Capcom, Flight, he says it will be ready in time.

960
01:09:27,050 --> 01:09:31,040
DAY 4 After this burn, we've got to build time in the flight plan for them to get sleep.

961
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,920
Run it by the FAO. I've run it by the FAO.

962
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:36,180
Do we know how long we're gonna fire that burn?

963
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:39,850
He wanted a quote from a flight director. Who wanted a quote?

964
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:41,620
The President. The President?

965
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:43,590
Nixon. He wants our odds.

966
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:46,930
We are not losing the crew.

967
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:50,690
NASA I gotta give him odds. Five to one against? Three to one?

968
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:54,140
I don't think they're that good. We are not losing those men.

969
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:02,380
How long are they gonna have to burn the engine PC + 2?

970
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:05,210
Look, tell him three to one.

971
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:10,910
Expect loss of signal in less than one minute.

972
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:14,140
When we pick you back up we will have your PC + 2 burn data.

973
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:18,810
Okay. Roger that, Houston. We'll hear from you again at acquisition of signal.

974
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:23,210
You wanna look?

975
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:26,950
Oh, look at that.

976
01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:38,630
Aquarius, that's 30 seconds until loss of signal.

977
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:44,870
Mare Tranquillitatis.

978
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:49,380
Neil and Buzz's old neighborhood.

979
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:52,410
Coming up on Mount Marilyn.

980
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:55,140
Jim, you gotta take a look at this.

981
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:58,240
I've seen it.

982
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:06,190
Aquarius, this is Houston.

983
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:09,860
We expect loss of signal in approximately ten seconds.

984
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:14,400
So long, Earth. Catch you on the flip side.

985
01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:26,670
When you go into the moon's shadow... and the moon is between you and the sun...

986
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:30,550
you see stars that are more brilliant than anything you've ever seen...

987
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,680
on the clearest nights here on Earth.

988
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:37,690
And then you pass into the lunar sunrise over the lunar surface.

989
01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:43,090
It must be an awe-inspiring sight. I can't wait to see it myself.

990
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:48,060
The problem now is not so much a question of adequate oxygen supply...

991
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:50,270
but it is the rate of consumption of water...

992
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:53,470
which is vitally needed for the cooling operations...

993
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:55,640
to maintain the electronic systems...

994
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:36,120
Look, it's Fra Mauro.

995
01:12:38,290 --> 01:12:40,450
I can see our landing site.

996
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,600
Look at the Tsiolkovsky Crater.

997
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:52,030
I can't believe how bright the ejecta blanket is.

998
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:55,000
It's like snow. It's beautiful.

999
01:12:57,170 --> 01:12:59,610
That's Mare Imbrium to the north.

1000
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:04,540
13, this is Houston.

1001
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:08,370
We're reading your telemetry. It's good to see you again.

1002
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,940
Good to see you, too, Houston.

1003
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:15,170
We are picking you up at a velocity of 7,062 feet per second...

1004
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:18,920
at a distance from the moon of 56 nautical miles.

1005
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:22,060
Stand by for your PC + 2 burn data.

1006
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:27,290
Got to tell you, I had an itch to take this baby down, do some prospecting.

1007
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:30,560
Damn, we were close.

1008
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:35,900
Gentlemen, what are your intentions?

1009
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,910
I'd like to go home.

1010
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:46,610
We got a burn coming up.

1011
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,980
We're gonna need a contingency if we lose comm with Houston.

1012
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:53,950
Let's get an idea where we stand on the consumables.

1013
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:56,920
Jack, get into the Odyssey...

1014
01:14:56,990 --> 01:15:00,450
and bag up all the water you can before it freezes in there.

1015
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:04,260
Let's go home.

1016
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:07,900
Aquarius, we got some PC + 2 burn data for you fellas.

1017
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:10,930
So you're telling me you can only give our guys 45 hours?

1018
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:16,280
That brings them to about there.

1019
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:22,450
Gentlemen, that's not acceptable.

1020
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:25,390
Gene, we've got to talk about power.

1021
01:15:25,790 --> 01:15:28,160
Guys! power is everything!

1022
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:31,390
power is everything. What do you mean?

1023
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:34,620
Without it, they don't talk to us, correct their trajectory...

1024
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,720
they don't turn the heat shield around.

1025
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:41,400
We gotta turn everything off. Now. They're not gonna make it to re-entry.

1026
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:45,200
What do you mean, "everything"? If everything's on, the LEM draws 60 amps.

1027
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:49,040
At that rate, in 16 hours the batteries are dead, not 45.

1028
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:52,240
And so is the crew. We gotta get them down to 12 amps.

1029
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:53,870
Twelve amps? How many?

1030
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:56,250
You can't run a vacuum cleaner on 12 amps, John.

1031
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:59,880
We gotta turn off the radars, cabin heater...

1032
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:02,360
instrument displays, guidance computer, everything.

1033
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:05,050
Guidance computer? What if they need to do another burn?

1034
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,060
They won't know which way they're pointed.

1035
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,360
The more time we talk, the more juice they waste.

1036
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:11,160
I've looked at data for the past hour.

1037
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:13,760
That's the deal? That's the deal.

1038
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:23,040
Okay, John. The minute we finish the burn, we'll power down the LEM.

1039
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:24,510
All right.

1040
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:29,550
Now, in the meantime, we're gonna have a frozen command module up there.

1041
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:33,250
Soon, we'll have to power it up using nothing but the re-entry batteries.

1042
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:37,050
That's never been tried before. We've never even simulated it before.

1043
01:16:37,130 --> 01:16:39,360
Well, we're gonna have to figure it out.

1044
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:42,890
I want people in our simulators working re-entry scenarios.

1045
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:46,430
I want you to find every engineer who designed every switch, circuit...

1046
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:48,030
transistor and light bulb up there.

1047
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:51,800
Then, talk to the guy in the assembly line who actually built the thing.

1048
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:55,610
Find out how to squeeze every amp out of both of these goddamn machines.

1049
01:16:56,280 --> 01:17:00,980
I want this mark all the way back to Earth with time to spare.

1050
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,550
We never lost an American in space.

1051
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:06,090
We're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch.

1052
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,920
Failure is not an option.

1053
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,730
What? Good, you're not dead.

1054
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,670
I've been trying to get in touch with you for 45 minutes.

1055
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:24,260
Jesus, what're you doing here?

1056
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,970
I gotta get you in the simulator. We got a ship to land.

1057
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:29,270
What? There's been an explosion.

1058
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:32,970
Oxygen tanks are gone, two fuel cells gone, command module's shut down.

1059
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,680
What about the crew? Fine so far.

1060
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:37,910
Trying to keep them alive in the LEM.

1061
01:17:37,990 --> 01:17:40,920
We'll have to shut that down pretty soon, too.

1062
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:44,020
We got a lot of people working the numbers on this one.

1063
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:46,930
Nobody's too sure how much power we'll have for re-entry.

1064
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,930
The command module will be frozen up pretty good by then.

1065
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:54,530
If you see this ammeter rise over 20 at any point, power-up is no good.

1066
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:57,300
If it spikes, that's sayonara for the guidance computer.

1067
01:17:57,370 --> 01:17:58,840
Our guys can't re-enter, okay?

1068
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:00,840
How much power do we have to play with?

1069
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:03,310
Barely enough to run this coffee pot for nine hours.

1070
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:05,870
Go. Ken Mattingly just got here.

1071
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:07,640
Copy. He's here.

1072
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,340
They've lost heat since the accident.

1073
01:18:10,450 --> 01:18:13,510
They'll start getting water condensation on the control panels.

1074
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:15,520
Glad you're here. You know what's going on?

1075
01:18:15,630 --> 01:18:17,120
John's brought me up to speed.

1076
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:19,360
What's left in the batteries? We don't know.

1077
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:21,860
We gotta get started on some shortcuts for power-up.

1078
01:18:21,970 --> 01:18:23,330
You know how short?

1079
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:27,300
It's all in the sequencing. If we can skip whatever we don't absolutely need...

1080
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:29,970
turn things on in the right order, maybe... I agree.

1081
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:33,570
You started on a procedure? Engineers have tried, but it's your ship.

1082
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:36,170
We gotta get you in there. Okay.

1083
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:38,910
Frank, I need the sim cold and dark.

1084
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:41,680
Give me the exact conditions they've got in there now.

1085
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:44,380
I need status of every instrument. You got it.

1086
01:18:44,490 --> 01:18:47,480
I need a flashlight. That's not what they have up there.

1087
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:49,790
Don't give me anything they don't have on board.

1088
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:53,190
Let's get this show on the road. Put him in space, fellas.

1089
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:58,330
Okay, Houston, the quad-heater circuit breakers are open.

1090
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,430
Copy that.

1091
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:02,400
We'll use the forward omni when the Earth's in the window...

1092
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:05,100
and we're switching to aft omni when we see the moon.

1093
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:06,840
We copy that, 13.

1094
01:19:06,910 --> 01:19:09,740
Aquarius, we don't want you to make any more waste dumps.

1095
01:19:09,850 --> 01:19:12,410
The venting may push you off course.

1096
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:15,080
Oh, Christ. What's up?

1097
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:19,550
No more waste dumps. We're just gonna have to store it.

1098
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:22,290
Jack, we're gonna need some more urine bags.

1099
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:26,690
Okay, Houston, that leaves us with just the computer...

1100
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:29,460
which I'm shutting down now.

1101
01:19:36,370 --> 01:19:37,900
And that's it.

1102
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:41,940
We just put Sir Isaac Newton in the driver's seat.

1103
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:49,050
Is it a.m. Or p. M?

1104
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:52,650
A.m. Very, very a.m.

1105
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,280
Haise is running a temperature, and no one has slept.

1106
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:59,330
I can't order these guys to go to sleep. Could you sleep up there?

1107
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:02,330
It's gonna get awful cold in there for those guys.

1108
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:07,000
Gene, we have a situation brewing with the carbon dioxide.

1109
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:09,470
We got a CO2 filter problem on the lunar module.

1110
01:20:09,570 --> 01:20:13,100
Five filters on the LEM. For two guys for a day and a half.

1111
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:15,580
I told the doc... We're up to eight on the gauges.

1112
01:20:15,650 --> 01:20:18,980
Anything over 15 and you get impaired judgment, blackouts...

1113
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,520
the beginnings of brain asphyxia.

1114
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:22,520
What about scrubbers in the command module?

1115
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:26,110
They take square cartridges. The ones on the LEM are round.

1116
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:29,520
Tell me this isn't a government operation.

1117
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:32,430
This just isn't a contingency we've remotely looked at.

1118
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,690
Those CO2 levels will be getting toxic.

1119
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:39,700
I suggest you gentlemen invent a way to put a square peg in a round hole. Rapidly.

1120
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:45,170
Okay, people, listen up!

1121
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:50,040
The people upstairs have handed us this one, and we gotta come through.

1122
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:54,080
We gotta find a way to make this...

1123
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:57,050
fit into the hole for this...

1124
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:59,310
using nothing but that.

1125
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:04,160
Let's get organized. Let's build a filter.

1126
01:21:04,230 --> 01:21:06,720
Better get some coffee going, too.

1127
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:10,290
The Haise family lives in El Lago, Texas.

1128
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:13,060
His wife, Mary, is from Biloxi, Mississippi.

1129
01:21:13,170 --> 01:21:17,400
When Fred Haise was growing up in Biloxi, he may have looked ahead to a fine family...

1130
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:18,910
but he never dreamt of flying.

1131
01:21:19,010 --> 01:21:21,570
I'd never flown before I went into the service...

1132
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:25,550
and I only went into the flying business as a means to getting a commission...

1133
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:29,090
Good morning. Henry. Don't you ever sleep?

1134
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:32,280
I have a request from the news people.

1135
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:36,580
They're out front here and they want to put a transmitter up on the lawn.

1136
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,860
Transmitter?

1137
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:42,620
It's kind of a tower for a live broadcast.

1138
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:52,310
I thought they didn't care about the mission. They didn't even run Jim's show.

1139
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:56,280
Well, it's more dramatic now. Suddenly people are...

1140
01:21:56,380 --> 01:22:00,410
If landing on the moon wasn't dramatic enough, why should not landing on it be?

1141
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:04,780
Look, I realize how hard this is, Marilyn...

1142
01:22:04,890 --> 01:22:06,790
but the whole world is caught up in it.

1143
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:09,590
It's the biggest story since... No, Henry.

1144
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:14,390
Those people don't put one piece of equipment on my lawn.

1145
01:22:14,770 --> 01:22:18,260
If they have a problem with that, they can take it up with my husband.

1146
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:20,500
He'll be home on Friday.

1147
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:37,990
DAY 5

1148
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,150
Hey, Fred.

1149
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:08,940
It's too cold in there.

1150
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:26,030
That's a nice one of Mary.

1151
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:32,940
You don't look too good, Freddo. I'll survive.

1152
01:23:33,010 --> 01:23:35,340
Aspirin in the medical kit. I took some.

1153
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:37,210
Jim, I'm all right.

1154
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:46,020
It was an accident, Mary getting pregnant.

1155
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:51,360
You should have seen the look on my face when she told me.

1156
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:54,920
Well, that has a tendency to happen.

1157
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:04,700
I wonder if it's a boy or a girl.

1158
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:08,710
You're gonna find out soon enough.

1159
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:10,840
Sure.

1160
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:17,850
I never dreamed I'd ever get to do something like this.

1161
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:20,690
Come up here on a real mission.

1162
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:24,290
Most of the guys I graduated high school with...

1163
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:26,730
never even left home, and here I am.

1164
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:28,360
Oh, yeah.

1165
01:24:29,570 --> 01:24:30,930
Here you are.

1166
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:38,370
It hurts when I urinate.

1167
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:43,900
Well, you're not getting enough water. I'm drinking my ration the same as you.

1168
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:49,880
I think old Swigert gave me the clap.

1169
01:24:50,890 --> 01:24:53,720
He's been pissing in my relief tube.

1170
01:24:56,490 --> 01:25:00,490
Well, that will be a hot one at the debriefing for the flight surgeon.

1171
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:04,560
That's another first for America's space program.

1172
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:11,670
Listen, I've been going over some stuff...

1173
01:25:12,610 --> 01:25:17,310
and I'm a little worried about this cold affecting our battery efficiency.

1174
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:22,110
We quit heating the glycol to save water and power, so that's not helping.

1175
01:25:22,190 --> 01:25:24,180
Could cost us amp hours on the back end?

1176
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:27,650
That's a possibility. I've been going over the numbers.

1177
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:30,250
Have they called up with a re-entry plan yet?

1178
01:25:30,330 --> 01:25:32,860
We're coming in too shallow... We're working on it.

1179
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:36,590
I can't remember the ratio to temperature. We got no references on board.

1180
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:38,960
Let's see if Houston can pull up the mil specs...

1181
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:42,840
Listen, they gave us too much Delta V. They had us burn too long.

1182
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:46,470
At this rate we'll skip right out of the atmosphere, and never get back.

1183
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:50,110
What are you talking about? How'd you figure that?

1184
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:51,650
I can add.

1185
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:57,110
Many Phds are working on this. Houston says we're on the money.

1186
01:25:57,190 --> 01:26:00,180
What if they made a mistake and there was no way to reverse it?

1187
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:01,490
You think they'd tell us?

1188
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:04,860
There's no reason! What do you mean? That's bullshit!

1189
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:07,400
There's 1,000 things that have to happen in order.

1190
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:12,370
We are on number eight. You're talking about number 692.

1191
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:15,700
In the meantime, I'm trying to tell you we're coming in too fast.

1192
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:19,140
I think they know it, and that's why we don't have a re-entry plan.

1193
01:26:19,210 --> 01:26:21,400
That's duly noted. Thank you, Jack.

1194
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:24,710
God damn this piece of shit!

1195
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,810
This piece of shit's gonna get you home.

1196
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:31,510
That's because that's the only thing we've got left, Jack!

1197
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:36,250
What are you saying, Fred? I think you know what I'm saying.

1198
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:39,420
Now wait a minute. All I did was stir those tanks.

1199
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:42,000
What was the gauge reading before you hit the switch?

1200
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:45,520
Don't tell me how to fly the CM! They brought me in to do a job!

1201
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,830
They asked me to stir the damn tanks, and I stirred the tanks!

1202
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:51,670
Stop kicking yourself in the ass. This is not my fault!

1203
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:53,680
No one is saying it is.

1204
01:26:54,010 --> 01:26:57,710
If I'm in the left-hand seat when the call comes up, I stir the tanks.

1205
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:58,840
Well, tell him that.

1206
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:02,080
I just asked you what the gauge was reading, and you don't know!

1207
01:27:02,190 --> 01:27:04,020
Look, we're not doing this, gentlemen.

1208
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:06,850
We're not bouncing off the walls for ten minutes...

1209
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:09,860
because we'll just end up with the same problems!

1210
01:27:10,090 --> 01:27:12,690
Try to figure out how to stay alive!

1211
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:15,730
Aquarius, this is Houston.

1212
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:18,530
Are we on VOX? No, we're not on VOX.

1213
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:21,190
Yeah, Houston, this is Aquarius. Go ahead.

1214
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:25,830
Yeah, Jim, could you check your CO 2 gauge for us?

1215
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:31,040
We were just looking at that.

1216
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:35,070
Our CO2 measurement has jumped four notches in the last hour.

1217
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:38,280
That can't be right. I went over those numbers three times.

1218
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:41,880
Jim, that sounds about right. We were expecting that.

1219
01:27:42,130 --> 01:27:45,560
That's very comforting to know, Houston. What do we do about it?

1220
01:27:45,630 --> 01:27:48,760
Jim, we're working on a procedure down here for you.

1221
01:27:50,830 --> 01:27:52,630
Do you copy? Oh, Christ.

1222
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:54,970
All right, we're standing by for those procedures.

1223
01:27:55,070 --> 01:27:57,470
Christ, I know why my numbers are wrong.

1224
01:27:58,410 --> 01:28:00,810
I only figured it for two people.

1225
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:07,140
Maybe I should just hold my breath.

1226
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:13,180
The deadly CO 2 gas is literally poisoning... the astronauts with every breath in and out.

1227
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:14,590
Heads up.

1228
01:28:17,090 --> 01:28:18,150
Go.

1229
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:21,990
Heads up, people. Look out now.

1230
01:28:24,930 --> 01:28:27,870
What's this? That's what they gotta make.

1231
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:31,440
I hope you got the procedures. Right here.

1232
01:28:31,510 --> 01:28:32,870
That's it?

1233
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:37,610
All right, Aquarius, this is Houston.

1234
01:28:37,710 --> 01:28:39,710
Do you have a flight plan up there?

1235
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:42,940
Affirmative, Andy. Jack's got one right here.

1236
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:46,820
Okay, we have an unusual procedure for you here.

1237
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:48,820
We need you to rip the cover off.

1238
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:51,650
He wants you to rip the cover off the flight plan.

1239
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:53,790
With pleasure.

1240
01:28:54,030 --> 01:28:56,400
The other materials you'll need are...

1241
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:58,570
a lithium hydroxide canister...

1242
01:28:58,670 --> 01:29:01,470
Two lithium hydroxide canisters, I'm sorry...

1243
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:03,800
a roll of gray tape. Duct tape.

1244
01:29:03,870 --> 01:29:07,810
Duct tape. You need an LCG bag... Two LCG bags...

1245
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:12,170
the red suit hoses, and you've got the flight plan cover.

1246
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:20,050
What about their level of carbon dioxide?

1247
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:21,820
It's climbing.

1248
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:26,190
You're saying that they're almost out of breathable air?

1249
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:30,600
Wait a second. That's not what he said. He said we're working on it.

1250
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:34,270
You want to cut the duct tape three feet long.

1251
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:36,530
Tell him to use his arm. Just use your arm.

1252
01:29:36,610 --> 01:29:39,540
An arm's length. I see what you're getting at.

1253
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:42,840
Jack, tear that piece of tape down the middle lengthwise.

1254
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:45,210
All right? Hold on, Houston.

1255
01:29:46,580 --> 01:29:50,110
While the astronauts appear to have enough oxygen to keep them alive...

1256
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:53,420
one thing they have too much of is carbon dioxide.

1257
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,390
With each breath, the three men expel...

1258
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:58,520
more of the poisonous gas into the lunar module cockpit...

1259
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,590
and the scrubbers intended to keep the atmosphere breathable...

1260
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:03,860
are quickly becoming saturated.

1261
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,030
Oh, shit, I tore it.

1262
01:30:11,410 --> 01:30:15,780
Houston, what do we do if we ripped the bag? can we tape it?

1263
01:30:15,950 --> 01:30:17,910
They just tore the bag. Oh, no.

1264
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:21,940
Stand by. What should I tell them to do? They should have one more bag left.

1265
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:24,750
But they've still got a long way to come...

1266
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:29,760
and are now working on backup facilities, their emergency facilities.

1267
01:30:29,930 --> 01:30:33,730
The problem is, if anything more goes wrong, they're in real trouble.

1268
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:06,990
As most of you are aware, there is no rescue possible in space flight.

1269
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:11,190
Any rescue system the space agency has long since calculated...

1270
01:31:11,530 --> 01:31:15,130
Any rescue system the space agency calculated...

1271
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:22,680
One sock. Once you have the sock in...

1272
01:31:22,780 --> 01:31:24,840
we're gonna want you... Work it in.

1273
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:28,320
...to bungee the entire filter assembly to the bulkhead...

1274
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:31,320
Right above the LEM canister. We're close to 15.

1275
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:37,390
So how does this flight compare to other emergency situations you've faced?

1276
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:41,220
I'll have to say that this is the most serious situation...

1277
01:31:41,330 --> 01:31:43,730
we've ever encountered in manned space flight.

1278
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:47,560
Houston, filter's in place. Cabin gas return to egress.

1279
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:50,540
Suit circuit relief to close.

1280
01:31:50,710 --> 01:31:53,840
CO2 canister select to secondary. All right.

1281
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:56,980
Here goes.

1282
01:31:58,410 --> 01:32:00,350
I can hear air moving.

1283
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:15,430
Just breathe normal, fellas.

1284
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:20,230
Aquarius, please advise on CO 2 status.

1285
01:32:21,070 --> 01:32:24,270
Houston, we're taking a look at those numbers now.

1286
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:31,080
We're still holding close to 15, Houston.

1287
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:33,270
Roger that. Standing by.

1288
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:47,490
Houston, the CO2 level has dropped to nine...

1289
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:50,920
and it is still falling.

1290
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:57,730
That is good to hear, Aquarius.

1291
01:32:57,810 --> 01:33:00,740
And you, sir, are a steely-eyed missile man.

1292
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:08,110
Okay, spacecraft control to computer.

1293
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:10,620
Damn!

1294
01:33:15,930 --> 01:33:17,450
We overloaded.

1295
01:33:18,030 --> 01:33:19,320
We used way too much power.

1296
01:33:19,430 --> 01:33:23,660
There must be a sneak circuit someplace between step seven and ten.

1297
01:33:23,770 --> 01:33:25,960
All right, which one has the leak?

1298
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:28,940
I don't know that yet, John.

1299
01:33:29,010 --> 01:33:32,700
The sequence was wrong. We just have to go back and try them one at a time.

1300
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:35,500
You need a break, Ken?

1301
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:38,510
If they don't get one, I don't get one.

1302
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:45,180
Well, if it won't work, get me another one.

1303
01:33:45,290 --> 01:33:48,520
My son's supposed to be on. I know, Mrs. Lovell.

1304
01:33:48,630 --> 01:33:50,060
Hi, Blanch.

1305
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:53,650
They can't fix a damn thing in this place.

1306
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:56,160
Blanch, it's Marilyn.

1307
01:33:56,870 --> 01:33:58,330
Hi, Grandma.

1308
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:01,170
I was gonna see Jimmy.

1309
01:34:01,670 --> 01:34:02,700
I know.

1310
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:07,710
We came to tell you something.

1311
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:12,070
There's been an accident. Jimmy's okay, he's all right.

1312
01:34:14,550 --> 01:34:17,540
But he's not gonna get to walk on the moon.

1313
01:34:18,390 --> 01:34:20,380
Well, they said he was.

1314
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:23,050
I know.

1315
01:34:25,700 --> 01:34:27,160
That was before.

1316
01:34:27,530 --> 01:34:30,830
Now there's been an explosion, and they're all okay...

1317
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:34,930
they're all right. But now they're just going to...

1318
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:39,240
try to figure out a way to get them home.

1319
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:47,580
And it's a little bit dangerous.

1320
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:50,520
Oh, sweetie.

1321
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:56,080
Are you scared?

1322
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,690
Well, don't you worry, honey.

1323
01:35:03,770 --> 01:35:06,740
If they could get a washing machine to fly...

1324
01:35:08,270 --> 01:35:10,260
my Jimmy could land it.

1325
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:53,350
Jack, you'll be happy to hear we contacted President Nixon...

1326
01:35:53,850 --> 01:35:57,450
and he's gonna grant you an extension on your income taxes...

1327
01:35:57,690 --> 01:36:01,350
since you are most decidedly out of the country.

1328
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:05,460
Roger that, Houston.

1329
01:36:05,830 --> 01:36:07,760
That's wonderful news.

1330
01:36:07,830 --> 01:36:09,800
Tell them they have to sleep.

1331
01:36:09,870 --> 01:36:12,300
Haise is running a fever of 104.

1332
01:36:12,670 --> 01:36:16,260
13, we've got another request from the flight surgeon...

1333
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:18,360
that you fellas get some more sleep.

1334
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:21,270
He doesn't like his readings down here.

1335
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:23,640
Let's see how he feels about this.

1336
01:36:23,710 --> 01:36:27,050
I am sick and tired of the entire western world...

1337
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:30,680
knowing how my kidneys are functioning!

1338
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:37,670
Flight, I just lost Lovell.

1339
01:36:42,350 --> 01:36:44,210
13, this is Houston.

1340
01:36:44,710 --> 01:36:48,150
Jim, we just had a dropout on your bio-med sensors.

1341
01:36:48,550 --> 01:36:51,150
I'm not wearing my bio-med sensors, Houston.

1342
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:03,960
Okay, Jim. Copy that.

1343
01:37:19,650 --> 01:37:22,140
Now I'm losing all three of them!

1344
01:37:23,090 --> 01:37:25,710
It's just a little medical mutiny, Doc.

1345
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:28,390
I'm sure the guys are still with us.

1346
01:37:29,390 --> 01:37:31,830
Let's cut them some slack, okay?

1347
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:39,560
DAY 6

1348
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:46,370
Gene, it's not the velocity, it's the angle.

1349
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:50,880
Maybe they're still venting something and that's throwing off the trajectory...

1350
01:37:50,950 --> 01:37:52,740
but we are definitely shallowing again.

1351
01:37:52,850 --> 01:37:55,610
We are up to a 5.9. Damn it.

1352
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:59,280
At this rate, they nick the atmosphere and bounce off into space.

1353
01:37:59,390 --> 01:38:01,360
We need another burn to get them back.

1354
01:38:01,420 --> 01:38:04,020
Another burn. Fire the engines, get on course.

1355
01:38:04,090 --> 01:38:05,120
Copy that.

1356
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:27,810
Aquarius, this is Houston.

1357
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:30,320
Houston, Aquarius.

1358
01:38:31,490 --> 01:38:34,250
Jim, we've got another course correction for you.

1359
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:36,090
What's up?

1360
01:38:36,830 --> 01:38:38,990
Something about another course correction.

1361
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:41,220
We copy, Houston.

1362
01:38:42,430 --> 01:38:46,230
Be advised, it's gonna take Freddo and I a while to power up the computer...

1363
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:49,900
for the alignment platform if we have to fire the engine.

1364
01:38:49,970 --> 01:38:54,140
Negative on that, Jim. We can't spare power for the computer.

1365
01:38:55,510 --> 01:38:57,140
We gotta do this blind?

1366
01:38:57,250 --> 01:39:00,740
Houston, without the computer, what do we use for orientation?

1367
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:03,980
Come on, we gotta be able to give these guys something.

1368
01:39:04,090 --> 01:39:06,580
Without the power, we can't give them a reading.

1369
01:39:06,660 --> 01:39:08,680
Not power. I'm talking about reference.

1370
01:39:08,790 --> 01:39:11,850
No, there's no references. We have a lot of debris...

1371
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:14,860
Houston, what's the story with this burn?

1372
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:18,100
We're trying to hash something out here, Aquarius.

1373
01:39:18,370 --> 01:39:19,700
Stand by.

1374
01:39:20,370 --> 01:39:24,970
Look, Houston, all we need to hold attitude is one fixed point in space.

1375
01:39:25,610 --> 01:39:28,670
Is that not correct? Yeah. Roger that, Jim.

1376
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:35,610
Well, Houston, we've got one.

1377
01:39:36,290 --> 01:39:39,310
If we can keep the Earth in the window, flying manually...

1378
01:39:39,820 --> 01:39:42,380
the crosshairs right on its terminator...

1379
01:39:42,490 --> 01:39:45,720
all I have to know is, how long do we need to burn the engine?

1380
01:39:45,830 --> 01:39:48,800
The shorter, the better. Roger that, Jim.

1381
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,870
Can they fly it manually and still shut it down on time...

1382
01:39:51,970 --> 01:39:53,370
without the computer?

1383
01:39:56,540 --> 01:39:58,370
I guess that's the best we can do. We're out of time.

1384
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:02,310
In order to enter the atmosphere safely...

1385
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:05,680
the crew must aim for a corridor just two-and-a-half degrees wide.

1386
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:09,340
If they're too steep, they'll incinerate in the steadily thickening air.

1387
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:12,410
If they're too shallow, they'll ricochet off the atmosphere...

1388
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:13,890
like a rock skipping off a pond.

1389
01:40:13,990 --> 01:40:18,480
The re-entry corridor is, in fact, so narrow that if this basketball were the Earth...

1390
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:22,730
and this softball were the moon, and the two were placed 14 feet apart...

1391
01:40:22,930 --> 01:40:27,100
the crew would have to hit a target no thicker than this piece of paper.

1392
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:29,670
On your toes. We're doing this one blind.

1393
01:40:29,740 --> 01:40:32,370
Gene, understand that we've never tried this before:

1394
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:36,440
Burn, cold soak, burn, cold soak, burn, manual control.

1395
01:40:36,550 --> 01:40:38,450
Look, it will ignite, will it not?

1396
01:40:38,550 --> 01:40:42,110
I just want you to know the engine's never been tried like this.

1397
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:44,620
That's all I'm trying to tell you.

1398
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:49,020
I know what you're trying to do. I guarantee I won't hold you personally responsible.

1399
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:52,360
If it lights, it lights. Let Lovell do the rest.

1400
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:54,290
Okay.

1401
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:59,630
They'll burn the engine and steer manually... attempting to keep the Earth in the window.

1402
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:09,110
Okay, this is gonna take all three of us.

1403
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:13,610
Freddo, you handle the pitch.

1404
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:16,680
Put on the translation controllers, all backwards...

1405
01:41:16,790 --> 01:41:19,850
so if the Earth starts drifting down...

1406
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:23,120
you need to thrust aft, not forward.

1407
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:26,120
I'll do the same on mine with everything else.

1408
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:29,700
We're going to burn at 10%% thrust for 39 seconds. Jack, you time us.

1409
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:30,890
Got it.

1410
01:41:31,230 --> 01:41:35,190
Give us a Count of the last 10 seconds up to 39. Let's not miss this.

1411
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:40,830
You up to this, Freddo?

1412
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:44,240
I'm with you.

1413
01:41:45,010 --> 01:41:48,140
Standing by for Corridor Control burn.

1414
01:41:48,220 --> 01:41:50,810
Okay, Jim, you can fire when ready.

1415
01:41:51,050 --> 01:41:53,390
You are go for the manual burn.

1416
01:41:53,490 --> 01:41:56,930
Okay, X-Plus button at 10 seconds. Mark.

1417
01:41:57,160 --> 01:41:59,890
Come on, baby. One more burn. Nine, eight...

1418
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:02,530
seven, six, five...

1419
01:42:02,630 --> 01:42:04,860
four, three... Ullage is go.

1420
01:42:04,970 --> 01:42:07,530
Two, one, ignition!

1421
01:42:09,470 --> 01:42:11,000
She's burning!

1422
01:42:11,310 --> 01:42:14,070
Master arm off. Okay, here we go.

1423
01:42:14,210 --> 01:42:17,480
Helium regulator on. RCS is go, 10% thrust.

1424
01:42:18,180 --> 01:42:21,640
Bring her around, Freddo. I'm trying but it's dragging.

1425
01:42:22,050 --> 01:42:24,750
Ten seconds. Drop it down, Freddo.

1426
01:42:24,850 --> 01:42:26,750
We're drifting! Hold What you got.

1427
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:29,090
I'll roll it. can't get it stable.

1428
01:42:29,190 --> 01:42:31,660
She's dancing all over the place!

1429
01:42:31,730 --> 01:42:34,590
Come to the right a little bit. Fifteen seconds.

1430
01:42:34,730 --> 01:42:36,890
She's drifting. I'm losing attitude.

1431
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,560
Hold it right there. That's it. No, Freddo, back!

1432
01:42:39,670 --> 01:42:41,900
Shit! I'm losing it! Bring the Earth up.

1433
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,340
Thrust forward, Fred. Come on.

1434
01:42:44,970 --> 01:42:47,810
Shit, I lost it! Where is it?

1435
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:49,900
7.'00. Helium regulator's closed.

1436
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:52,710
Bring it down, Freddo. Just nose it down.

1437
01:42:52,820 --> 01:42:54,540
Okay, I got it! Thirty seconds.

1438
01:42:54,650 --> 01:42:56,680
Little farther. Ease your touch!

1439
01:42:57,990 --> 01:43:00,850
Damn it, that's mine. That's me. Around.

1440
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:05,820
A little more. Come on, baby. That's it. Hold it.

1441
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:08,920
Back! That's it! Hold it! Steady. Eight, nine!

1442
01:43:09,030 --> 01:43:10,360
Shutdown!

1443
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:23,240
Houston, we have shutdown.

1444
01:43:23,350 --> 01:43:25,970
That's close enough, Jim. Good Work.

1445
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:30,820
I knew it! How about that LEM! How about it?

1446
01:43:32,690 --> 01:43:35,160
Guess you can keep your job. GRUMYou betcha.

1447
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:39,160
13, stand by. We're evaluating our power usage on that burn.

1448
01:43:40,830 --> 01:43:43,160
Let's hope we don't have to do that again.

1449
01:43:57,280 --> 01:44:01,440
Gentlemen, you've given our guys enough to survive till re-entry.

1450
01:44:02,890 --> 01:44:04,250
Well done.

1451
01:44:07,690 --> 01:44:11,020
Now we gotta get them in, so tell me about the Power-up procedures.

1452
01:44:11,090 --> 01:44:13,560
Here's the order of what I want to do.

1453
01:44:13,630 --> 01:44:17,460
I want to power up guidance, ECS, Communications...

1454
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:22,400
warm up the pyros for the ParaChutes and the Command module thrusters.

1455
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:25,370
The thrusters will Put you over budget on amPs.

1456
01:44:25,540 --> 01:44:29,530
They've been sitting at 200 below for four days. They gotta be heated.

1457
01:44:29,610 --> 01:44:31,600
Fine. Then trade off the ParaChutes.

1458
01:44:32,050 --> 01:44:35,950
If the Chutes don't open, what's the Point? You're telling me what you need.

1459
01:44:36,050 --> 01:44:39,820
I'm telling you what we have to work with. I'm not making this stuff up.

1460
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:41,980
They're going to need all these systems.

1461
01:44:42,090 --> 01:44:45,580
We do not have the power, Ken. We just don't have it.

1462
01:44:49,270 --> 01:44:53,000
I'll reorganize the sequencing again and find more power.

1463
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:56,470
Let's start from scratch. Clear the board.

1464
01:44:59,780 --> 01:45:02,070
I don't know where the hell we'll find it.

1465
01:45:02,570 --> 01:45:06,090
Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell has more time in space...

1466
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:09,070
almost 24 days already, than any other man...

1467
01:45:09,140 --> 01:45:11,770
and I asked him recently if he ever was scared.

1468
01:45:11,870 --> 01:45:15,040
I had an engine flame out a few times in an aircraft...

1469
01:45:15,110 --> 01:45:20,010
and was curious as to whether it was going to light up again, things of that nature...

1470
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:22,180
but they seem to Work out.

1471
01:45:22,890 --> 01:45:27,380
Is there an instance in an airplane emergency when you recall fear?

1472
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:31,630
Well, I remember this one time...

1473
01:45:31,730 --> 01:45:35,530
in a Banshee at night in combat conditions, so the carrier has no lights.

1474
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:38,230
It was the Shangri-la. We were in the Sea of Japan.

1475
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:41,930
My radar had jammed, and my homing signal was gone...

1476
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:45,410
because somebody in Japan was using the same frequency...

1477
01:45:45,810 --> 01:45:49,040
and so it was leading me away from where I was supposed to be.

1478
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:54,380
I'm looking down at a big, black ocean, so I flip on my map light.

1479
01:45:54,820 --> 01:45:58,480
Then, suddenly, zap! Everything shorts out right there in my cockpit.

1480
01:45:58,590 --> 01:46:02,790
All my instruments and lights are gone, I can't even tell what my altitude is.

1481
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:08,160
I know I'm running out of fuel, so I'm thinking about ditching in the ocean.

1482
01:46:08,730 --> 01:46:11,830
I look down there, and then in the darkness...

1483
01:46:11,930 --> 01:46:14,560
there's this green trail.

1484
01:46:14,740 --> 01:46:19,140
It's like a long carpet that's just laid out beneath me. It was the algae!

1485
01:46:20,310 --> 01:46:24,340
It was that phosphorescent stuff that gets churned up in the wake of a big ship.

1486
01:46:24,450 --> 01:46:26,680
It was just leading me home.

1487
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:30,080
And if my cockpit lights hadn't shorted out...

1488
01:46:30,150 --> 01:46:32,450
there's no way I'd have ever been able to see that.

1489
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:35,080
So, you never know...

1490
01:46:35,190 --> 01:46:38,630
What events are going to transpire to get you home.

1491
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:47,340
Spacecraft commander Jim Lovell is no stranger to emergency.

1492
01:46:58,510 --> 01:47:01,140
How's it going, Fred? I'm okay.

1493
01:47:03,550 --> 01:47:05,280
What the hell was that?

1494
01:47:06,190 --> 01:47:08,490
Let's hope it was just the burst disk.

1495
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:12,620
Can you confirm a burst helium disk? We confirm that.

1496
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:16,460
Houston, is that going to affect our entry angle at all?

1497
01:47:17,030 --> 01:47:20,300
Negative. Your entry angle is holding at 6.24, Aquarius.

1498
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:22,400
Houston...

1499
01:47:24,410 --> 01:47:28,500
we sure could use the re-entry procedure up here.

1500
01:47:29,410 --> 01:47:31,470
When can we expect that?

1501
01:47:33,850 --> 01:47:36,180
That's coming real soon, Aquarius.

1502
01:47:36,250 --> 01:47:37,840
Houston, we...

1503
01:47:38,820 --> 01:47:41,920
We just can't throw this together at the last minute.

1504
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:44,420
So, here's what you're gonna do.

1505
01:47:44,730 --> 01:47:48,390
You're gonna get the procedure up to us, whatever it is...

1506
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:52,730
and we're gonna go over it step by step, so there's no foul-ups.

1507
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:56,670
I don't have to tell you we're all a little tired up here.

1508
01:47:56,770 --> 01:47:59,540
The world's getting awfully big in the window.

1509
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:02,170
Jim, this is Deke. It's Deke.

1510
01:48:02,610 --> 01:48:04,880
They don't know how to do it.

1511
01:48:05,420 --> 01:48:07,010
Maybe Jack's right.

1512
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:10,450
Hello, Deke. What's the story?

1513
01:48:10,550 --> 01:48:14,510
We're gonna get that procedure to you as soon as we possibly can.

1514
01:48:14,620 --> 01:48:17,590
Ken Mattingly's in the simulator right now.

1515
01:48:18,930 --> 01:48:20,760
Ken's working on it?

1516
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:27,760
Look, I know this sequence works, John.

1517
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:30,630
It looks good. We're just over budget on the amperage.

1518
01:48:30,740 --> 01:48:33,070
By how much? Three or four amps.

1519
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:35,270
God damn it, John! Is it three or four?

1520
01:48:35,450 --> 01:48:36,910
Four. Four!

1521
01:48:38,580 --> 01:48:40,140
Four more amps.

1522
01:48:50,830 --> 01:48:53,630
They have some power left in the LEM batteries, right?

1523
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:54,920
Yeah.

1524
01:48:56,230 --> 01:49:00,260
We have an umbilical that provides power from the command module to the LEM.

1525
01:49:00,340 --> 01:49:03,830
It's backup for the LEM power supply. I'm listening.

1526
01:49:04,270 --> 01:49:08,900
So reverse it. Reverse the flow and see if we can draw these four amps...

1527
01:49:08,980 --> 01:49:11,850
from the LEM before we cut it loose. Why can't we do that?

1528
01:49:13,420 --> 01:49:17,010
We don't have a procedure for that? You'll lose a lot in the transfer.

1529
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:20,580
Yeah. But all we're talking about here is four amps.

1530
01:49:21,790 --> 01:49:24,450
I want whatever you guys got on these Power procedures.

1531
01:49:24,530 --> 01:49:27,460
Gene, they're already... Not all, just Part.

1532
01:49:27,530 --> 01:49:30,470
We've got to give them something. They're working on it.

1533
01:49:30,530 --> 01:49:32,630
I'll get an estimate. God damn it!

1534
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:36,930
I don't want another estimate! I want the procedures now!

1535
01:49:49,390 --> 01:49:50,780
IMU is up.

1536
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:54,680
How am I reading? Fine, so far.

1537
01:49:54,890 --> 01:49:57,490
Say again. You're under limit. Keep going.

1538
01:49:58,490 --> 01:50:00,620
Okay. Floodlights to fixed.

1539
01:50:02,530 --> 01:50:05,060
Okay, I'm bringing up the guidance.

1540
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:09,000
Here we go.

1541
01:50:10,710 --> 01:50:12,570
CMC Attitude IMU.

1542
01:50:13,580 --> 01:50:15,170
CMC source.

1543
01:50:15,910 --> 01:50:19,010
CMC mode, auto, and we're on the computer.

1544
01:50:30,090 --> 01:50:32,690
Go ahead. Is your computer on now?

1545
01:50:33,430 --> 01:50:35,230
up and running.

1546
01:50:36,070 --> 01:50:37,530
How do we look?

1547
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,100
I think we got it, buddy.

1548
01:50:59,260 --> 01:51:02,780
Arthur, my notes are clear on that last sequence, right?

1549
01:51:03,030 --> 01:51:06,120
Excuse me, gentlemen. I was getting a little blurry.

1550
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:11,420
Here's Ken. Here's John.

1551
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:14,390
It's good to see you, Ken.

1552
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:16,070
This is the sequence.

1553
01:51:16,140 --> 01:51:19,370
Was it tried on the hardware yet? We didn't have time.

1554
01:51:20,410 --> 01:51:22,740
Aquarius, Houston. Do you read?

1555
01:51:23,750 --> 01:51:25,740
Yeah, we read you, Ken.

1556
01:51:27,820 --> 01:51:30,410
Are the flowers blooming in Houston?

1557
01:51:30,490 --> 01:51:34,290
That's a negative, Jim. I don't have the measles.

1558
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:41,050
Jim, is Jack in there with you?

1559
01:51:41,460 --> 01:51:44,330
Yeah, stand by one. We gotta get him on Comm.

1560
01:51:44,430 --> 01:51:47,330
Put those on the table. Damn it. Thanks, Jackie.

1561
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:49,770
I think it would really help if you could...

1562
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:54,240
just distract her when the heavy Predictions come in.

1563
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:57,400
We'll give it a shot. Thanks.

1564
01:51:59,580 --> 01:52:03,110
Blanch, these nice, young men are gonna watch television with you.

1565
01:52:03,190 --> 01:52:06,850
This is Neil Armstrong, and this is Buzz. Nice to meet you.

1566
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:11,020
Hi. Are you in the space program?

1567
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:16,360
Okay, Jack, give me a read-back on that last procedure.

1568
01:52:16,670 --> 01:52:18,190
Stand by, Ken.

1569
01:52:21,970 --> 01:52:26,200
Ken, I'm having trouble reading my own writing.

1570
01:52:26,310 --> 01:52:29,610
I guess I was a little more tired than I thought.

1571
01:52:34,650 --> 01:52:37,280
Don't worry, Jack. I'll talk you through it.

1572
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:42,850
Find the main bus breakers on Panel 11.

1573
01:52:45,390 --> 01:52:47,230
Yeah, main bus breakers. Got it.

1574
01:52:47,460 --> 01:52:49,120
Close main bus B.

1575
01:52:57,140 --> 01:53:00,910
Ken, there's an awful lot of Condensation on these Panels.

1576
01:53:01,180 --> 01:53:03,870
What's the word on these things shorting out?

1577
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:11,080
We'll just take that one at a time, Jack.

1578
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:17,190
It's like trying to drive a toaster through a Car wash.

1579
01:53:24,770 --> 01:53:26,670
Main bus B is closed.

1580
01:53:26,740 --> 01:53:29,330
13, We're coming up on entry interface.

1581
01:53:29,410 --> 01:53:33,030
Flight, we're still shallowing up a bit in the re-entry corridor.

1582
01:53:33,110 --> 01:53:35,270
It's almost like they're underweight.

1583
01:53:35,410 --> 01:53:38,710
Now how could they be underweight? We didn't land on the moon.

1584
01:53:40,450 --> 01:53:42,380
Rocks? That's affirm.

1585
01:53:43,390 --> 01:53:47,950
One more thing. While Jack's working on the power-up, We want you and Freddo...

1586
01:53:47,950 --> 01:53:50,440
to transfer some ballast over to the command module.

1587
01:53:50,530 --> 01:53:52,390
Say again, Houston. Ballast?

1588
01:53:53,030 --> 01:53:55,900
That's affirm. We got to get the weight right.

1589
01:53:55,970 --> 01:53:59,590
We were expecting you to be toting a couple hundred pounds of moon rocks.

1590
01:53:59,700 --> 01:54:01,140
Right, Houston.

1591
01:54:01,700 --> 01:54:03,870
Now, Jack. Yeah, go ahead, Ken.

1592
01:54:03,970 --> 01:54:06,240
Okay, now, panel five.

1593
01:54:06,910 --> 01:54:11,710
Circuit breaker caution and warning main B closed.

1594
01:54:12,050 --> 01:54:13,740
Main B closed.

1595
01:54:15,250 --> 01:54:16,950
Master alarm off.

1596
01:54:17,150 --> 01:54:21,250
Okay, Jack, on panel seven, b-mag number two, power to warm-up.

1597
01:54:21,490 --> 01:54:24,080
B-mag number two, power to warm-up. Done.

1598
01:54:24,430 --> 01:54:26,830
Sequential logic one and two on.

1599
01:54:27,130 --> 01:54:30,000
Sequential logic, two on.

1600
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:32,670
CMRCS pressure, on.

1601
01:54:33,240 --> 01:54:35,030
CMRCS Pressurization.

1602
01:54:35,100 --> 01:54:38,600
DAY 7 As her husband prepares to jettison his lunar module lifeboat...

1603
01:54:38,670 --> 01:54:41,510
Marilyn lovell waits with her children, her neighbors...

1604
01:54:41,610 --> 01:54:46,070
and, we are told, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.

1605
01:54:46,450 --> 01:54:49,250
Only the Lovells' eldest son, Jay, is absent...

1606
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:51,510
as he holds vigil with his classmates...

1607
01:54:51,620 --> 01:54:54,780
at the St. John's Military ACademy in wisconsin.

1608
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:57,650
ABC News science editor Jules Bergman.

1609
01:54:57,860 --> 01:55:01,520
With a crippled command module, and surviving by using the LEM's systems...

1610
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:03,630
there can be no easy maneuver.

1611
01:55:03,700 --> 01:55:06,960
Their LEM lifeboat is doing things and working longer...

1612
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:08,590
than it was ever intended to.

1613
01:55:08,670 --> 01:55:11,110
It's a race against time until splashdown...

1614
01:55:11,370 --> 01:55:14,140
We're ready to see if the computer will accept...

1615
01:55:14,210 --> 01:55:16,510
uplink of the re-entry data now.

1616
01:55:17,850 --> 01:55:19,140
Okay, the IMU is up.

1617
01:55:19,220 --> 01:55:21,950
We got our eight-balls back. copy that.

1618
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:26,720
Okay, Ken, uplink telemetry, Command module to accept, right?

1619
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:29,850
That's affirm. Go ahead and try it.

1620
01:55:50,580 --> 01:55:52,310
uplink completed.

1621
01:55:57,920 --> 01:56:00,580
That's more like it. Okay, let's go.

1622
01:56:00,690 --> 01:56:02,850
Take a look at your amPs. How we doing?

1623
01:56:05,830 --> 01:56:07,730
We got her back up, Ken.

1624
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:10,190
Boy, I wish you were here to see it.

1625
01:56:10,270 --> 01:56:11,930
I'll bet you do.

1626
01:56:15,170 --> 01:56:16,830
Way to go, Jack.

1627
01:56:21,910 --> 01:56:24,180
Flight, this is RETRO. Go, RETRO.

1628
01:56:24,350 --> 01:56:26,840
Flight, we have a typhoon warning...

1629
01:56:26,950 --> 01:56:30,040
on the edge of the prime recovery zone. Say again, RETRO.

1630
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:34,250
We're looking at a typhoon Warning on the edge of the prime recovery area.

1631
01:56:34,360 --> 01:56:37,020
This is just a warning. It could miss them.

1632
01:56:37,090 --> 01:56:39,250
Only if their luck changes.

1633
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:41,950
Jim, we're ready for SM jettison!

1634
01:56:42,770 --> 01:56:44,890
All right, Jack, on three!

1635
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:48,100
One, two...

1636
01:56:48,870 --> 01:56:51,570
upward thrust. We're loose!

1637
01:56:52,410 --> 01:56:54,070
Reverse thrust!

1638
01:56:54,340 --> 01:56:56,640
We have sevice module jettison.

1639
01:56:56,710 --> 01:56:59,410
Okay, Houston, servjce module is free.

1640
01:56:59,780 --> 01:57:01,880
We'll take a look at What We have here.

1641
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:03,450
Copy that.

1642
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:09,560
There it is. I see it!

1643
01:57:13,230 --> 01:57:16,460
Houston, we're getting our first look at the sevice module now.

1644
01:57:16,570 --> 01:57:19,300
One whole side of the spacecraft is missing.

1645
01:57:20,740 --> 01:57:24,570
right by the high gain antenna a whole panel is blown out...

1646
01:57:25,110 --> 01:57:27,800
right up to our heat shield.

1647
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:31,110
Copy that, Aquarius.

1648
01:57:31,180 --> 01:57:34,670
It looked like it got the engine bell, too. Can you see that?

1649
01:57:38,590 --> 01:57:40,750
Oh, man, that's incredible.

1650
01:57:44,130 --> 01:57:45,350
The heat shield.

1651
01:57:45,460 --> 01:57:50,090
The heat will build up to as much as 3,000 or 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

1652
01:57:51,430 --> 01:57:53,420
On a lunar re-entry flight, the heat...

1653
01:57:53,500 --> 01:57:54,970
So, Blanch?

1654
01:57:56,870 --> 01:57:59,640
Did Jim make Eagle Scout or not?

1655
01:57:59,810 --> 01:58:01,470
Yes, he did. He did.

1656
01:58:01,540 --> 01:58:06,480
If the heat shield is cracked the extreme cold could've split it wide open.

1657
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:09,950
Worst of all, if the pyrotechnics that control the parachutes...

1658
01:58:10,020 --> 01:58:12,780
have been damaged, the chutes may not open at all...

1659
01:58:12,890 --> 01:58:16,720
causing the spacecraft to hit the water not at a gentle 20 miles per hour...

1660
01:58:16,990 --> 01:58:18,890
but at a suicidal 300.

1661
01:58:19,330 --> 01:58:21,230
Perhaps never in history...

1662
01:58:21,330 --> 01:58:24,820
has the entire world been united by such a global drama.

1663
01:58:24,970 --> 01:58:27,560
In NeW York City, thousands of people have gathered...

1664
01:58:27,670 --> 01:58:30,330
to watch updates of the mission in Times Square.

1665
01:58:30,410 --> 01:58:33,380
Many countries offered help and the State Department said...

1666
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:35,410
it would ask for it if it were needed.

1667
01:58:35,510 --> 01:58:38,810
The House and Senate passed resolutions calling on the people...

1668
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:40,970
to pray tonight for the astronauts.

1669
01:58:41,050 --> 01:58:44,250
In Rome, Pope Paul led 50,000 people...

1670
01:58:44,350 --> 01:58:47,020
in prayers for the safe return of the astronauts.

1671
01:58:47,090 --> 01:58:49,720
In Jerusalem, prayers at the Wailing Wall...

1672
01:58:55,660 --> 01:58:58,570
It's about time to bail out of this ship.

1673
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:07,370
You okay?

1674
01:59:09,110 --> 01:59:10,600
I'm freezing.

1675
01:59:13,120 --> 01:59:15,740
Can you hold out just a little longer?

1676
01:59:16,190 --> 01:59:18,420
Long as I have to. Come on.

1677
01:59:19,350 --> 01:59:22,760
It won't be long. Just a little while longer.

1678
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:30,130
Just a little while longer. We're gonna hit that water in the South Pacific.

1679
01:59:30,970 --> 01:59:32,760
Open up that hatch.

1680
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:36,900
It's 80 degrees out there. 80 degrees.

1681
01:59:39,810 --> 01:59:43,210
You are a mess. Yeah.

1682
01:59:45,250 --> 01:59:47,940
Odyssey, Houston. How we doing, guys?

1683
01:59:48,050 --> 01:59:50,280
We're closing in on lunar module jettjson.

1684
01:59:50,390 --> 01:59:52,580
As you know, that is time critical.

1685
01:59:52,650 --> 01:59:55,250
You should be moving into the command module.

1686
01:59:55,320 --> 01:59:56,950
Let's get that hatch buttoned up...

1687
01:59:57,060 --> 02:00:00,060
and when you get a chance, let us know how you're doing.

1688
02:00:00,060 --> 02:00:01,460
Roger that.

1689
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:06,930
Let me give you a hand there, Freddo.

1690
02:00:42,100 --> 02:00:44,500
We're coming up on LEM jettjson.

1691
02:00:44,840 --> 02:00:47,600
Is everyone strapped in, Ken? We're getting real close.

1692
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:51,980
Copy that, Flight. 13, Houston. We're coming up on LEM jettison.

1693
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:53,810
Stand by.

1694
02:00:55,180 --> 02:00:57,210
Have you got everybody in the Odyssey?

1695
02:00:57,320 --> 02:01:00,620
Yeah, Ken, I'm gonna check those Pyro batteries one more time here.

1696
02:01:02,060 --> 02:01:06,360
The Pyro batts look good. I don't think we have to tie the other batteries.

1697
02:01:18,910 --> 02:01:21,310
Sorry, Jack, this is an old habit.

1698
02:01:21,380 --> 02:01:24,680
I'm kind of used to the Pilot's seat. She's yours to fly.

1699
02:01:30,050 --> 02:01:33,510
Odyssey, I want to double check some re-entry procedures...

1700
02:01:33,590 --> 02:01:37,490
right after we jettjson the LEM, Which is coming up in 30 seconds.

1701
02:01:38,390 --> 02:01:39,880
What is that?

1702
02:01:41,430 --> 02:01:43,020
I was getting Punchy...

1703
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:46,830
and I didn't want to cut the LEM loose with you guys still in it.

1704
02:01:48,070 --> 02:01:49,940
That's good thinking.

1705
02:01:52,010 --> 02:01:53,740
Stand by, Houston.

1706
02:01:56,410 --> 02:01:58,740
We have lunar module jettjson.

1707
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:08,610
She sure was a good ship.

1708
02:02:10,060 --> 02:02:13,260
FareWell, Aquarius, and we thank you.

1709
02:02:23,870 --> 02:02:25,900
It's almost time, honey.

1710
02:02:29,380 --> 02:02:31,470
Flight 966406.

1711
02:02:46,330 --> 02:02:51,270
USS IWO JIMA, SOUTH PACIFIC APRIL 17, 1970

1712
02:02:52,130 --> 02:02:53,660
Let me put it this way.

1713
02:02:53,740 --> 02:02:56,570
The traiectory may be off. Their thrusters may be frozen.

1714
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:58,800
Their guidance system might be malfunctioning.

1715
02:02:58,910 --> 02:03:00,640
Their heat shield could be cracked.

1716
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:03,680
And their Parachutes might be three blocks of ice.

1717
02:03:03,780 --> 02:03:05,800
Clearly, we have some obstacles to overcome.

1718
02:03:05,910 --> 02:03:08,970
But now I'm asking you, when will we know?

1719
02:03:10,050 --> 02:03:14,750
Blackout lasts for three minutes. If they're not back in four, we'll know.

1720
02:03:16,290 --> 02:03:20,130
Velocity now reading 34,802 feet Per second.

1721
02:03:20,260 --> 02:03:23,460
Range to go 2,625 nautical miles. Copy that.

1722
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:29,000
Okay, Ken, we are aligned for re-entry. Jim, we need that computer re-entry program.

1723
02:03:29,100 --> 02:03:31,970
Fred, how are the batteries looking? Okay.

1724
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:35,970
Batt A looks good. Re-entry interface in one minute...

1725
02:03:36,040 --> 02:03:39,670
Batt B, no volts, the amps are okay... and 30 seconds.

1726
02:03:40,820 --> 02:03:42,150
Batt C...

1727
02:03:43,190 --> 02:03:45,210
No volts, only two amps.

1728
02:03:46,460 --> 02:03:49,020
It may die before the main chutes open.

1729
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:52,230
Roger. Let's tie all the batteries onto main A and main B.

1730
02:03:52,330 --> 02:03:55,850
They're still shallowing a bit up there. Do you want to tell them?

1731
02:03:56,630 --> 02:03:59,400
Is there anything we can do? Not now, Flight.

1732
02:03:59,500 --> 02:04:02,060
They don't need to know, do they? Copy that.

1733
02:04:02,170 --> 02:04:05,730
RETRO says the typhoon is still a presence in the splashdown area?

1734
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:08,710
We got the Parachute situation...

1735
02:04:08,810 --> 02:04:11,300
heat shield, angle of traiectory, and a typhoon.

1736
02:04:11,380 --> 02:04:15,210
There are so many variables, I'm at a loss... I know what the problems are.

1737
02:04:15,380 --> 02:04:18,380
This could be the worst disaster NASA has experienced.

1738
02:04:18,490 --> 02:04:23,080
With all due respect, sir, I believe this is going to be our finest hour.

1739
02:04:36,040 --> 02:04:38,670
Expect entry interface in 45 seconds.

1740
02:04:39,570 --> 02:04:41,700
And on my mark, your velocity...

1741
02:04:41,780 --> 02:04:45,010
will be 35,245 feet per second.

1742
02:04:46,520 --> 02:04:49,420
Mark 35 seconds to entry interface.

1743
02:04:52,220 --> 02:04:53,690
Gentlemen...

1744
02:04:56,290 --> 02:04:59,020
it's been a privilege flying with you.

1745
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:44,440
Flight, we have loss of radio contact. Roger that.

1746
02:05:44,510 --> 02:05:47,000
Expect to regain signal in three minutes.

1747
02:05:50,680 --> 02:05:52,480
It all depends on the heat shield.

1748
02:06:25,710 --> 02:06:28,340
Back to the lwo Jima and our live cameras there.

1749
02:06:28,780 --> 02:06:32,150
The Navy recovery and rescue helicopters already airborne...

1750
02:06:32,220 --> 02:06:35,050
cjrcling, waiting for first radar contact.

1751
02:06:35,160 --> 02:06:37,850
Three minutes until drogue deployment.

1752
02:06:39,030 --> 02:06:42,360
Standing by for any reports of acqujsitjon.

1753
02:06:47,400 --> 02:06:50,500
One minute and 30 seconds to end of blackout.

1754
02:06:55,810 --> 02:06:58,400
No re-entering ship has taken longer...

1755
02:06:58,510 --> 02:07:01,350
than three minutes to emerge from blackout.

1756
02:07:01,420 --> 02:07:04,820
this is the critical moment. will the heat shield hold?

1757
02:07:05,250 --> 02:07:09,190
will the command module survive the intense heat of re-entry?

1758
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:12,190
If it doesn't, there'll only be sjlence.

1759
02:07:12,330 --> 02:07:15,390
Mommy, you're squishing me. Sorry, sweetie.

1760
02:07:15,930 --> 02:07:17,020
It's okay.

1761
02:07:33,380 --> 02:07:35,540
Okay, Flight, that's three minutes.

1762
02:07:35,620 --> 02:07:38,880
We are standing by for acquisition. Copy that.

1763
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:43,050
Odyssey, Houston. Do you read me?

1764
02:07:46,130 --> 02:07:48,360
Expected time of reacquisition...

1765
02:07:48,430 --> 02:07:51,960
the time When the astronauts were expected to come out of blackout...

1766
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:55,060
has come and gone.

1767
02:07:56,140 --> 02:07:59,700
About all any of us can do now is just listen and hope.

1768
02:07:59,770 --> 02:08:02,540
We're about to learn whether or not that heat shield...

1769
02:08:02,610 --> 02:08:05,880
Which was damaged by the explosion three days ago...

1770
02:08:06,110 --> 02:08:08,880
has withstood the inferno of re-entry.

1771
02:08:12,990 --> 02:08:15,920
Odyssey, this is Houston. Do you read me?

1772
02:08:22,160 --> 02:08:24,760
Three minutes, 30 seconds. Standing by.

1773
02:08:25,400 --> 02:08:27,730
Odyssey, Houston. Do you read?

1774
02:08:35,610 --> 02:08:38,480
Odyssey, this is Houston. Do you read me?

1775
02:08:42,780 --> 02:08:45,410
That's four minutes. Standing by.

1776
02:09:07,640 --> 02:09:09,840
Odyssey, Houston. Do you read?

1777
02:09:18,290 --> 02:09:20,690
Hello, Houston, this is Odyssey.

1778
02:09:20,820 --> 02:09:22,650
It's good to see you again.

1779
02:09:46,410 --> 02:09:48,750
Odyssey, Houston. Welcome home.

1780
02:09:49,080 --> 02:09:51,020
We're glad to see you.

1781
02:09:51,650 --> 02:09:53,750
Good job, Ken. Thank you.

1782
02:10:38,430 --> 02:10:39,920
They made it!

1783
02:11:22,810 --> 02:11:25,970
Houston, we're at stable one. The ship is secure.

1784
02:11:26,780 --> 02:11:29,110
This is Apollo 13 signing off.

1785
02:11:29,450 --> 02:11:30,780
Good job.

1786
02:12:22,570 --> 02:12:25,200
Our mission was called a successful failure...

1787
02:12:25,310 --> 02:12:28,540
in that we returned safely, but never made it to the moon.

1788
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:31,340
In the following months it was determined...

1789
02:12:31,410 --> 02:12:34,470
that a damaged coil built inside the oxygen tank...

1790
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:39,480
sparked during our cryo stir and caused the explosion that crippied the Odyssey.

1791
02:12:39,750 --> 02:12:42,090
It was a minor defect that occurred two years...

1792
02:12:42,190 --> 02:12:44,590
before I was even named the flight's commander.

1793
02:12:45,260 --> 02:12:48,660
Fred Haise was going back to the moon on Apollo 18...

1794
02:12:48,730 --> 02:12:51,060
but his mission was cancelled due to budget cuts.

1795
02:12:51,170 --> 02:12:53,160
He never flew in space again.

1796
02:12:53,500 --> 02:12:56,270
Nor did Jack Swigert, Who left the Astronaut corps...

1797
02:12:56,370 --> 02:12:59,430
and was elected to congress from the state of colorado.

1798
02:12:59,610 --> 02:13:02,440
But he died of cancer before he was able to take office.

1799
02:13:03,910 --> 02:13:07,780
Ken Mattingly orbited the moon as command module pilot of Apollo 16...

1800
02:13:07,880 --> 02:13:11,680
and flew the Space Shuttle, having never gotten the measles.

1801
02:13:12,350 --> 02:13:16,790
Gene kranz retired as Director of Flight Operations just not long ago.

1802
02:13:17,090 --> 02:13:20,250
Many members of mission control have gone on to other things...

1803
02:13:20,360 --> 02:13:22,420
but some are still there.

1804
02:13:23,260 --> 02:13:24,730
And as for me...

1805
02:13:25,100 --> 02:13:29,230
the seven extraordinary days of Apollo 13 were my last in space.

1806
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:34,230
I watched other men walk on the moon and return safely...

1807
02:13:34,710 --> 02:13:38,940
all from the confines of mission control and our house in Houston.

1808
02:13:40,080 --> 02:13:42,780
I sometimes catch myself looking up at the moon...

1809
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:46,320
remembering the changes of fortune in our long voyage...

1810
02:13:46,590 --> 02:13:50,650
thinking of the thousands of people who worked to bring the three of us home.

1811
02:13:51,990 --> 02:13:54,590
I look up at the moon and wonder...

1812
02:13:55,260 --> 02:13:56,960
When will we be going back...

1813
02:13:57,900 --> 02:13:59,560
and who will that be?
