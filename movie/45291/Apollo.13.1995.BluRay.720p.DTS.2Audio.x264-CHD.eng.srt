1
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,070
We have the crew...

2
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,230
crossing gantry for capsule ingress.

3
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,340
Roger that.

4
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,840
lnspired by the late President Kennedy...

5
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,470
in only seven years, America has risen...

6
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,840
to the challenge of what he called...

7
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,140
'the most hazardous and dangerous...

8
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,750
and greatest adventure...

9
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,220
on which man has ever embarked.'

10
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,620
After trailing the Russians for years...

11
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,560
with our manned space program...

12
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,390
We got a short. - and after that sudden...

13
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,560
on the launchpad during a routine test...

14
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,400
that killed American astronauts Gus Grissom...

15
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,570
Ed White and Roger Chaffee... - Get us outta here.

16
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,770
there were serious doubts that we...

17
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,970
could beat the Russians to the moon.

18
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,310
But tonight, a mere 18 months after the tragedy of Apollo 1...

19
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,370
the entire world watched in awe...

20
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,550
as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin...

21
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,620
landed on the moon.

22
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,920
The big news came just a moment ago.

23
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,860
Mission Control gave the spacecraft permission...

24
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,890
to go for the extravehicular activity--...

25
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,930
that is, for the walk on the moon--...

26
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:47,730
far earlier than anticipated, 9:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.

27
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,870
lmportant thing when you're penetrating...

28
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,700
the lunar module is your attitude...

29
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,710
and your relative speed.

30
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,550
Let's say this is me in the command...

31
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,780
module and this is you...

32
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,780
All right. - in the LEM.

33
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,610
This thing sticks out. That's called a probe.

34
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,620
ls that true? - Absolutely.

35
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,690
Tracey, when you feel that thing slide in, everything's clickin'...

36
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:11,100
it's like no other feeling in the world.

37
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,430
A little liquid propulsion. - What's the big occasion?

38
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,500
How's it goin' at Mission Control?

39
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,240
lt's a nervous time. They're pacin' around, smokin' like chimneys.

40
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,060
Gene Kranz is gonna have puppies.

41
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,700
Jim Lovell.

42
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,540
Hi. - This is Tracey.

43
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,540
How do ya do, Tracey? - This is the man.

44
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,180
Gemini 7. Gemini 12. Apollo 8.

45
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,140
They were the first around the moon.

46
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,650
This guy did ten laps.

47
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,150
With one hand on the wheel. Make yourselves at home.

48
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,150
Hey, Marilyn. - Where have you been?

49
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,520
This is the last champagne in Houston.

50
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,520
Very good. Very good. - Everything else all right?

51
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,330
Everything's on course. - Looks okay. Hey. Cadet Lovell.

52
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,330
Hey, Dad. - Put this on ice.

53
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,350
You gonna get a haircut this week?

54
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,330
l'm on vacation.

55
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,200
Oh, get a haircut.

56
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,750
Well, hello there.

57
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,310
l wouldn't mind bein' up there tonight.

58
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,520
God, who wouldn't.

59
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,490
Don't worry. Our day's comin'.

60
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,560
They're not gonna cut the program before number 14.

61
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,920
You know, my cousin called. - Uh-huh.

62
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,360
Asked who we bribed to get on Jim Lovell's crew.

63
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,660
Yeah.

64
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,200
l told him they wanted to make sure he got the best.

65
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,440
Well, they got that right.

66
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,270
What network do we want?

67
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,840
Come on. Walt. Hey. Put on Walter.

68
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,840
Walter. - Jules Bergman.

69
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,340
John, turn it up.

70
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,780
...has completed putting on the spacesuits and the boots.

71
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,300
l, uh-- l really appreciate you all...

72
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,890
coming to this dress rehearsal party...

73
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,120
for my Apollo 12 landing.

74
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,630
Sit down, Conrad.

75
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,160
l think we should all take a moment to recognize...

76
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,100
the exemplary-- hell, damn near heroic--...

77
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,800
effort displayed by Neil Armstrong's...

78
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,370
backup for this historic moon walk...

79
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,710
and, of course, his crew.

80
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:01,740
Let's hear it for Jim Lovell, Ken Mattingly and Fred Haise.

81
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,250
There he is. There he is. Everybody quiet down.

82
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,420
Hey. Kids.

83
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,260
We had a good touchdown.

84
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,890
We can verify the position of the...

85
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,660
opening l ought to have on the camera.

86
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,970
What?

87
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,210
Think it's too late for him to abort? - He still has time to get out.

88
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,220
He just needs somebody to wave him off.

89
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,980
Pull up, Neil.

90
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,280
Pull up. Pull up.

91
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,910
Okay, Neil, we can...

92
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,580
see you coming down the ladder now.

93
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,720
Look at those pictures. Wow.

94
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,520
l'm, uh, at the foot of the ladder.

95
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,320
The LEM footpads are only depressed...

96
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,330
in the surface about, uh...

97
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,430
one or two inches.

98
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,800
lt's almost like a powder. - Armstrong is on the moon.

99
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,400
Neil Armstrong, 38-year-old American...

100
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,650
standing on the surface of the moon...

101
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,910
on this July 20, 1969.

102
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,880
That's one small step for man...

103
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,490
one giant leap for mankind.

104
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,520
His quote was...

105
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:19,390
'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.'

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,740
Somewhere

107
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,910
Beyond the sea

108
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,080
Somewhere Waitin' for me...

109
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,750
You're drunk, Lovell. - Yeah.

110
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,950
l'm not used to the champagne.

111
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,050
Me neither.

112
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,930
l can't deal with cleaning up. Let's sell the house.

113
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,660
All right, let's sell the house.

114
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,070
They're back inside now lookin' up at us.

115
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,270
lsn't that somethin'?

116
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,740
l bet Jannie Armstrong doesn't get a wink of sleep tonight.

117
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,150
When you were on the far side on 8,

118
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,680
l didn't sleep at all.

119
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,410
l just vacuumed over and over again.

120
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,360
Christopher Columbus,

121
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,750
Charles Lindbergh and Neil Armstrong.

122
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,020
Neil Armstrong.

123
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,510
From now on, we live in a world...

124
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,420
where man has walked on the moon.

125
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,610
lt's not a miracle.

126
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,280
We just decided to go.

127
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,820
On Apollo 8, we were so close...

128
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,290
just 60 nautical miles down and--...

129
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,560
lt was like l could just...

130
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,360
step out and walk on the face of it.

131
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,740
l want to go back there.

132
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,720
Where's my mountain?

133
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,390
Well, it-- Up there.

134
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,760
lt's, uh, right up by the--...

135
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,530
lt's-- Okay, do you see where the shadow crosses...

136
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,100
the white area there?

137
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,800
That's the Sea of Tranquility...

138
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,240
and your mountain's right there on the edge of that.

139
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,000
lt's your mountain. Your mountain, Marilyn. Mount Marilyn.

140
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,730
l don't see it.

141
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,540
Well, you gotta look harder.

142
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,600
You-- You-- You look harder...

143
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,860
Jim. - while l--

144
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,860
Jim.

145
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,190
Groovin'

146
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,690
Down a crowded avenue

147
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,730
The astronaut is only the most visible member...

148
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,160
of a very large team, and all of us...

149
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,530
down to the guy sweeping the floor...

150
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,540
are honored to be a part of it.

151
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,320
What did the man say? 'Give me a lever...

152
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,940
long enough and l'll move the world'?

153
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,340
That's what we're doing here. This is divine inspiration.

154
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,280
lt's the best part of each one of us, the belief that anything is possible.

155
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,950
Things like a computer that can fit into a single room...

156
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,820
and hold millions of pieces of information...

157
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,560
or the Saturn 5 rocket.

158
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,630
This is the actual launch vehicle that will be taking Alan Shepard...

159
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:33,930
and his crew on the first leg of the Apollo 13 mission.

160
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,040
When are you going up again, Jim?

161
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,830
l'm slated to be the commander...

162
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,020
of Apollo 14 sometime late next year.

163
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,220
lf there is an Apollo 14.

164
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,030
Jim, people in my state have been asking why we're continuing...

165
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,160
to fund this program now that we've...

166
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,960
beaten the Russians to the moon.

167
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,620
lmagine if Christopher Columbus...

168
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,330
had come back from the new world...

169
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,870
and no one returned in his footsteps.

170
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,670
Attention, all personnel. Clear level three.

171
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,320
Are there any other questions?

172
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,210
How do you go to the bathroom in space?

173
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,520
Well, l tell you, it's a highly technical process...

174
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,600
of cranking down the window and...

175
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,920
looking for a gas station, which, uh--

176
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,090
Oh, there's Deke Slayton.

177
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,160
Deke, you might be able to answer this lady's question.

178
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,090
Deke is one of the original Mercury...

179
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,070
seven astronauts, ladies and gentlemen.

180
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,700
Now he's our boss. He hands out...

181
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,470
the astronauts' flight assignments...

182
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,570
so naturally we kick back part of our salaries to Deke.

183
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:37,080
How much this month? - Can l have a minute?

184
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,220
Sure, you b-- Uh, Henry?

185
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,650
Hey.

186
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,260
Anybody home?

187
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,990
l'm not being a cheerleader, Mom.

188
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,130
You don't understand. l worked so hard on this.

189
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,630
Maybe l don't understand...

190
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,000
but you are not wearing that out in this neighborhood.

191
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,430
She's not even wearing a bra. You can see everything.

192
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,940
Shut up.

193
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,510
Everybody. Marilyn, trick or treat. - Jim.

194
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,440
You know that Easter vacation trip we had planned for Acapulco?

195
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,940
Uh-oh.

196
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,950
l was thinkin' there might be a slight change in destination.

197
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,480
Really?

198
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,680
Maybe, say... the moon.

199
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,130
Al Shepard's ear infection has flared up...

200
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:27,400
and we've all been bumped up to the prime crew of Apollo 13.

201
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,700
Straight to the head of the line and the Fra Mauro highlands.

202
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,510
Six months? You're moving up six months?

203
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,080
Dad, can l please wear this? - Sure.

204
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,510
Jim. - No. No. Absolutely not.

205
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,450
Don't you want somebody to love - This stinks.

206
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,850
They're not rushing things, are they?

207
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,890
You're gonna be ready in six months?

208
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,150
We'll be ready. Boy, l wouldn't want...

209
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,020
to be around Al Shepard tonight.

210
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,100
l gotta get over there.

211
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,760
We're gonna have to get up to speed.

212
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,660
Go. Go.

213
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,000
l'm gonna walk on the moon, Marilyn.

214
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,370
l know. l can't believe it.

215
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,910
Naturally, it's 13. Why 13?

216
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,070
lt comes after 12, hon.

217
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,280
Apollo 13, you are go for docking.

218
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,250
Apollo 13, you are go for docking.

219
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,400
All systems are nominal and on the line.

220
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,270
All systems are nominal and on the line.

221
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:23,180
Okay, S-4B is stable, slot panels are drifting free.

222
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,780
The drogue is clear. The docking target is clear.

223
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,220
Okay, l'm comin' up on that now. Two... one... mark.

224
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,060
Seventy-five feet. We're comin' up on docking.

225
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,250
Let's shut down some thrusters on 'em.

226
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,200
We'll see what he does.

227
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,470
Whoa. Wait a minute.

228
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,810
l lost something here. l can't translate up.

229
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,240
Houston, we are drifting down and away.

230
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,150
Wanna back off and take another run?

231
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,250
No, l got it.

232
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,350
Let me just try and get it stable here.

233
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:59,020
l'm gonna reset the high gain. - Got the target back in the reticle.

234
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,420
We're stable. Go ahead and recycle the valves.

235
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,580
Forty feet. - They're all gray.

236
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,900
Twenty.

237
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,870
Easy. - Ten feet.

238
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,840
Capture. - That's it.

239
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,580
That's it. - Sweet move, Ken. Beautiful.

240
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,820
Gentlemen, that is the way we do that.

241
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,080
Man, that woke me up.

242
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:31,020
Apollo 13 backup crew, you're up in the simulator.

243
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,360
Nice job, gentlemen. - That's three hours of boredom...

244
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,530
followed by seven seconds of sheer terror.

245
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,070
Good job, guys. You just won the Christmas turkey.

246
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:44,470
Nice try, Frank. You really outfoxed 'em, brother.

247
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,410
Yeah, but it wasn't perfect. Used up too much fuel.

248
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,410
You're above the curve.

249
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,150
Not by much. Listen, guys, l wanna work it again.

250
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,070
Hey, we gotta be up with the dawn patrol...

251
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,250
headed for Bethpage, what, 0700?

252
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,250
Wheels up at 0700. - Yeah, l know...

253
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,020
but my rate of turn is still a little slow.

254
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,830
l really think we should work it again.

255
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:11,000
Well, let's get it right. - Okay, set it up again, Frank.

256
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,170
Okay, 13 backup crew. lt'll have to wait.

257
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:18,170
Prime crew's up for another run. - Yeah, baby.

258
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,680
Apollo 13, we show S-4B shutdown...

259
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,750
and all systems are nominal.

260
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,120
Fred, set the S-band omni to B...

261
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,920
and when you get in the LEM, two forward.

262
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,760
Good shape over here.

263
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,330
Hey, we got a problem.

264
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:41,510
Ken, get your helmet on. - l can't get it locked.

265
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,300
Oh, God.

266
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,920
Jim.

267
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,490
l thought the stars would fall down on you.

268
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,760
That's silly. Stars can't fall on us.

269
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,360
You're a smarter kid than l was.

270
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,420
How long will it take to get to the moon?

271
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:33,130
Four days. But that's pretty fast.

272
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,530
See, this is the Saturn 4B booster...

273
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,670
and it shoots us away from the Earth...

274
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:42,770
as fast as a bullet from a gun...

275
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,410
until the moon's gravity actually grabs us and pulls us...

276
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:51,780
into a circle around the moon...

277
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,850
which is called an orbit.

278
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,020
All right?

279
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,720
Fred and l float down the tunnel into the lunar module...

280
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,730
this spidery-lookin' guy.

281
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,230
Only holds two people,

282
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,800
and it's just for landin' on the moon.

283
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,840
And l take the controls and l steer it around...

284
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,000
and l fly it down...

285
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,770
adjustin' it here, the attitude there, pitch, roll...

286
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,610
for a nice, soft landing on the moon.

287
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:22,390
Better than Neil Armstrong. Way better than Pete Conrad.

288
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,320
Dad... did you know the astronauts in the fire?

289
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:37,400
Yeah. Yeah, l did. l knew the astronauts in the fire. All of 'em.

290
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,330
Could that happen again?

291
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,040
Well, l'll tell ya somethin' about that fire.

292
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,510
Um, a lot of things went wrong.

293
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,050
The, uh-- The door.

294
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,340
lt's called the hatch. They couldn't...

295
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,690
get it open when they needed to get out.

296
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,890
That was one thing. And, uh--

297
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,820
Well, a lot of things went wrong in that fire.

298
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,770
Did they fix it?

299
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:12,240
Oh, yes. Absolutely. We fixed it.

300
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,630
lt's not a problem anymore.

301
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,020
l can't believe they still...

302
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,960
have you doing public appearances.

303
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:34,030
Well, Henry Hurt was... all over me.

304
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,900
l know. But with a training schedule this tight--

305
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,240
Well, it's-- lt's the program, Marilyn.

306
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,470
You know, it's NASA.

307
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,200
Hey. Hey, you're Jim Lovell, aren't ya?

308
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,610
Hey. Lucky 13.

309
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,770
Right on.

310
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,930
That's the second time it's done that.

311
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,830
l was looking at the kids' school schedule coming up.

312
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,330
Yeah?

313
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,770
lt's a very busy week. - Yeah.

314
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,640
l'm thinking about not going to the launch.

315
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,580
Huh.

316
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,250
The kids need me at home, honey.

317
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:30,360
Marilyn, we've had these kids for awhile now.

318
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,390
They've never kept you from comin' to the other launches.

319
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,790
But now we have your mother. She's just had this stroke.

320
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,300
Mom's fine.

321
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,970
lt's not like l've never been to a launch.

322
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,470
The other wives have not done three.

323
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,330
l just don't think l can go through all that.

324
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,570
l'll just be glad when this one's over.

325
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,620
Well, you're gonna miss a hell of a show.

326
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,630
Jim. - Hey, guys. See ya in a few weeks.

327
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,930
Take care. Bring us back a moon rock.

328
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,210
So the number 13 doesn't bother you.

329
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,280
Only if it's a Friday, Phil.

330
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,720
Apollo 13, lifting off at 1300 hours and 13 minutes...

331
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,120
and entering the moon's gravity on April 13?

332
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,070
Uh, Ken Mattingly here has been...

333
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,130
doing some scientific experiments...

334
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,130
regarding that very phenomenon, haven't you?

335
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:02,240
Uh, yes. Well, l had a black cat, uh, walk over a broken mirror...

336
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,170
under the lunar module ladder.

337
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,940
lt didn't seem to be a problem.

338
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,340
We're considering a letter we got from a fella...

339
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,380
who said we oughta take a pig with us for good luck.

340
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,480
Does it bother you that the public regards this flight as routine?

341
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,620
There's nothing routine about flying...

342
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,490
to the moon. l can vouch for that.

343
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:24,290
And, uh, l think that an astronaut's last mission--...

344
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:29,530
his final flight-- that's always going to be very special.

345
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,700
Why is this your last, Jim?

346
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,540
l'm in command of the best ship...

347
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,640
with the best crew that anybody could ask for...

348
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,420
and l'll be walking in a place...

349
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,510
where there's 400 degrees difference...

350
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:45,650
between sunlight and shadow.

351
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,170
l can't imagine, uh, ever topping that.

352
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,780
We have that scheduled for 0900 hours tomorrow.

353
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,840
That's not gonna work, Walter. - Why?

354
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,480
Freddo and l are gonna be goin' over the...

355
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,910
lunar surface experiments tomorrow...

356
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,380
and Ken's gonna be back in the simulator.

357
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,480
We're gonna be goin' over the flight plan tonight.

358
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,380
Gonna pay a visit to this machine after you're hard down. Thanks.

359
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,990
Jim, we've got a problem.

360
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,690
We just got some blood work back from...

361
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,260
the lab. Charlie Duke has the measles.

362
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,730
So we need a new backup.

363
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,700
You've all been exposed to it. - Oh, l've had the measles.

364
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,400
Ken Mattingly hasn't.

365
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,740
You wanna break up my crew two days before the launch...

366
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,950
when we can predict each other's moves,

367
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,040
read the tone of each other's voices?

368
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,210
Ken Mattingly will be getting seriously ill...

369
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,400
precisely when you and Haise will...

370
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,590
be ascending from the lunar surface.

371
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,590
That's a lousy time for a fever.

372
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,420
Jack Swigert has been out of the loop for weeks.

373
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,690
He's fully qualified to fly this mission.

374
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,480
He's a fine pilot, but when was...

375
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,360
the last time he was in a simulator?

376
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,730
l'm sorry, Jim. l understand how you feel.

377
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,740
We can do one of two things.

378
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,110
We can either scrub Mattingly and go with Swigert...

379
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:08,460
or we can bump all three of you to a later mission.

380
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:15,620
l've trained for the Fra Mauro highlands...

381
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,960
and this is flight surgeon horseshit, Deke.

382
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:24,060
Jim, if you hold out for Ken, you will not be on Apollo 13.

383
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,290
lt's your decision.

384
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,670
Oh, let it ring.

385
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:34,540
Listen, l-l gotta take that.

386
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,020
Oh, why?

387
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,840
Because l'm on the backup crew...

388
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,720
and the backup crew has to set up...

389
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,750
the guest list and book the hotel room.

390
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:44,010
Swigert. Yeah.

391
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:51,320
Yes. Yes, sir. Uh-uh, l understand.

392
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,830
Thank you, sir.

393
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,210
Well, l, uh--

394
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,030
Damn.

395
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,870
Medical guys.

396
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:36,350
l had a feeling when they started doing...

397
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:39,250
all the blood tests that, uh--...

398
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:47,550
l mean, l know it's their ass if l get sick up there, but, l mean-- Jesus.

399
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:02,070
Oh, boy.

400
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,900
Swigert, he'll be fine. He's, uh--

401
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,100
He's strong.

402
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,770
lt'll be a hell of a mission. One for the books.

403
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,690
You sure about this? Why don't l talk to Deke?

404
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:26,490
l'm sure we can work this out.

405
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,960
This was my call.

406
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,610
Must've been a tough one.

407
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,820
Look, l don't have the measles.

408
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,520
l'm not gonna get the measles.

409
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,150
Shit. Ken, wait up.

410
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,670
Trajectory is holding steady. We're right on the line.

411
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:11,590
We're into program 64. We're in 05 Gs,

412
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,210
so we're feeling that gravity now.

413
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:18,320
Houston, we are at 400,000 feet passing entry interphase.

414
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,320
About to lose signal.

415
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:25,050
Reentry data is nominal, and we have radio blackout.

416
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,730
What's the story here?

417
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,800
l got a corridor light. We're comin' in too shallow.

418
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,730
l'm goin' to manual.

419
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,010
Houston, switching to S.C.S. - Roger, Thirteen.

420
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,850
Okay, we're at three Gs.

421
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,850
Five Gs.

422
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,850
We're comin' in too steep.

423
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:55,660
l'm gonna stay in this roll, see if l can pull us out.

424
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,960
We're at eight Gs.

425
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,650
Nine. Ten.

426
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,870
We're at 12 Gs. - Twelve Gs. We're burnin' up.

427
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:09,510
Damn it.

428
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:12,680
l gave 'em a false indicator light at entry interphase.

429
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,710
Even Mattingly didn't get it the first time.

430
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,910
How ya feelin', Freddo?

431
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,410
Char-broiled.

432
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,920
So what happened?

433
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,830
Came in too steep. We're dead.

434
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:28,930
No shit.

435
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:33,560
Yeah, we were into program 67 there.

436
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:39,210
Okay, we're gonna do this again, obviously...

437
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,870
but give us a minute to get our switches reset.

438
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,180
Jim, could we have a word?

439
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,150
Oh, sure, Deke.

440
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:57,710
We're going to drop off line and debrief.

441
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,400
So? - Well...

442
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,200
if l had a dollar for every time they killed me in this thing...

443
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,440
l wouldn't have to work for you, Deke.

444
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:16,080
Well, we have two days. We'll be ready.

445
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,200
Let's do it again.

446
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,450
Do it again.

447
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,850
Margaret, get them. Fred, Stephen, come here.

448
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,360
Daddy. - Watch out. You'll fall.

449
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,060
We can't go across that road.

450
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,610
We don't want Daddy to get our germs...

451
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,460
and get sick in outer space.

452
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,830
Hey, boys. Not givin' your mom a hard time, are ya?

453
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,420
Princess, you look beautiful.

454
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,010
Jack.

455
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,860
Well, hey, that looks like Marilyn Lovell.

456
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,970
But it can't be. She's not coming to the launch.

457
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,970
l heard it was gonna be a hell of a show.

458
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,700
Who told you that?

459
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,290
Some guy l know.

460
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,250
You can't live without me.

461
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,180
Okay, folks. Let's say good night.

462
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,480
We got a big day tomorrow. - Good night.

463
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,390
You hear about Ken?

464
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,420
Yeah.

465
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:58,250
One, two.

466
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,510
Stand back, please.

467
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:05,190
Ah, Guenter Wendt.

468
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,350
l wonder where Guenter went?

469
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,610
Jim.

470
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,660
You walk on ze moon, ja? - Ja. Ja, we walk and--...

471
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,490
and we talk on ze moon.

472
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,400
How do you feel? Pretty good?

473
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,040
Good. Might be a little warmer in here, huh?

474
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:35,770
How are you today? Ready? - Good. Yeah.

475
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,760
Oh. Oh. Jeez. Oh.

476
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,240
Oh, God, no.

477
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,280
Oh, no.

478
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,230
Okay, we have the oxygen burn system?

479
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,330
Check.

480
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:22,000
We have the helmet restraint ring? - Check.

481
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,510
Communication umbilical on.

482
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:35,540
Fred. - What?

483
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,770
Gum. - Aw, sorry.

484
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,520
Thanks.

485
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,320
l'm gonna give these guys a beautiful ride.

486
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,420
Sure you will, Jack.

487
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,330
You need more air?

488
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:21,390
You want some apple?

489
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,400
Marilyn, hey. - Mary.

490
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,700
Aw, l hate this already.

491
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,900
You're not just about to pop, are you?

492
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,870
No. l got 30 days 'til this blast-off.

493
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,720
This is for Gene.

494
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:23,830
Mrs. Kranz has pulled out the needle and thread again.

495
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:26,270
The last one looked like he bought it off a gypsy.

496
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,800
Well, you can't argue with tradition.

497
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,810
Copy that.

498
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,880
This is from your wife, Gene.

499
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,880
Thank you, Tom.

500
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,530
l was startin' to get worried.

501
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,220
There we go.

502
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,650
l like it. l like that one, Gene. - Sharp, Gene.

503
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,590
Jim, you're all set.

504
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:12,040
Very sharp.

505
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,410
Hey, Gene, l guess we can go now.

506
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:17,100
Save it for splashdown, guys.

507
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:39,800
Apollo 13 flight controllers, listen up.

508
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,410
Give me a go, no go for launch.

509
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,740
Booster. - Go.

510
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,580

CAPCOM. - We're go, Flight.

519
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,930
Launch Control, this is Houston. We are go for launch.

520
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,800
Roger that, Houston.

521
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,270
Pad leader, what's your status?

522
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,410
We are go for launch.

523
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,230
T minus 60 seconds and counting.

524
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,230
Stand by. - Roger.

525
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,620
Fuel pumps.

526
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,970
This is it. A few bumps and we're haulin' the mail.

527
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:18,320
Control, this is Guidance. They're ready for takeoff.

528
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,310
We are go for launch.

529
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:26,280
T minus-- - 15... 14...

530
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:30,280
13... 12... 11...

531
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,290
ten... nine...

532
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,760
eight... seven...

533
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,860
six... ignition sequence starts...

534
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,760
three... two... one...

535
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,860
ignition.

536
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,680
The clock is running.

537
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,890
We have lift-off.

538
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:35,760
Houston, we have cleared the tower at 1313.

539
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,950
Okay, guys, we got it.

540
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,700
Come on, baby. Come on.

541
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,120
Altitude is on the line.

542
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,980
Velocity right on the line.

543
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,390
Roll complete. We are pitching.

544
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:10,620
Thirteen, stand by for mode one Bravo.

545
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,170
FlDO, how we lookin'?

546
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,940
Looks good, Flight. Right down the middle.

547
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:25,040
We see your B.P.C. is clear, Thirteen.

548
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,480
Roger. E.D.S. to manual.

549
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,310
lnboard.

550
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:33,610
Get ready for a little jolt, fellas.

551
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:49,630
That was some little jolt.

552
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,330
Tower jett.

553
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:11,210
Houston, we've got a center engine cutoff. Go on the other four.

554
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,630
Roger that, Thirteen. We show the same.

555
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,870
Booster, can you confirm that cutoff?

556
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:21,170
Roger. Looks like we lost it. - FlDO, what's that going to do?

557
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,670
Stand by, Flight.

558
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:27,530
l need to know if the l.U.'s correcting for the shutdown.

559
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,650
Houston, what's the story on engine five?

560
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,030
We're still go. We'll be all right...

561
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,060
as long as we don't lose another one.

562
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,030
Roger that. - Thirteen, we're not sure...

563
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,470
but the other engines are go,

564
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,240
so we're gonna burn those engines...

565
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,240
a little bit longer.

566
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,040
Roger that. Our gimbals are good.

567
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,870
Our trim is good.

568
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,930
Looks like we just had our glitch for this mission.

569
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,160
13, stand by for staging. - Roger that.

570
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:21,370
S-2 shutdown. S-4B ignition.

571
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,770
Thrust looks good, Flight.

572
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,540
Flight, S-4B cutoff in ten seconds.

573
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,380
Thirteen, this is Houston.

574
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,980
Predicted cutoff is 12 plus 34, over.

575
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:36,880
Coming up on 12 minutes 34.

576
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,890
And-- - SECO.

577
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:43,560
Shutdown.

578
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:48,030
And that, gentlemen, is how we do that.

579
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,790
Oh, boy. Hope l can sleep.

580
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,930
Mom, that was loud.

581
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:20,670
Here, hold my hand.

582
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:23,400
l can't believe you did this four times.

583
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,900
The worst part's over.

584
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,070
lt is?

585
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:29,400
Listen, this doesn't stop for me...

586
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,050
until he lands on that aircraft carrier.

587
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,250
Well, you just look so calm about it.

588
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,580
lf the flight surgeon had to okay me...

589
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,620
for this mission, l'd be grounded.

590
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,490
Mrs. Lovell. Mrs. Haise. Can we speak to you?

591
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,760
Can we just have a word with you?

592
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:46,290
Remember, you're proud, happy and thrilled.

593
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,800
Mrs. Lovell.

594
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,630
How're ya feeling? - Well, very proud...

595
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:53,620
and very happy, and we're thrilled.

596
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,640
Flight, Booster. l show S-4B shutdown.

597
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,680
T.L.l. is on the money. Looks good, Flight.

598
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:05,180
Roger, FlDO.

599
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,120
Okay, guys. We're goin' to the moon.

600
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,960
Flight, we have reacquisition of signal at Hawaii.

601
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,960
Flight, everything looks good.

602
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,860
Okay, Houston. C.M.P. here.

603
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,200
l've exchanged couches with Jim. l'm in the pilot's seat.

604
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:26,040
l'm gonna go ahead and get set for transposition and docking.

605
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,660
Roger that, Jack.

606
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,620
Freddo, you okay?

607
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:49,360
Okay, let's get turned around and pick up the lunar module.

608
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:53,170
Odyssey, you're go for pyro arm and docking...

609
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:56,400
and we recommend you secure cabin pressurization.

610
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,240
Roger that.

611
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:04,180
Okay, we're ready for C.S.M. separation.

612
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,880
Okay, S.M.R.C.S. isol valves are all gray.

613
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,190
Okay, Swigert, command module pilot...

614
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:13,550
she's all yours.

615
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,900
Houston, we've got a good separation.

616
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,700
The S-4B is stable. - Translation looks good.

617
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,220
We confirm that, Thirteen.

618
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,300
We're gonna start to pitch around...

619
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,300
to line up with the LEM.

620
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,370
You know, Freddo, Frank Borman...

621
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:33,410
was upchuckin' most of the way to the moon on Apollo 8.

622
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:38,780
l'm all right. l just ate too much breakfast. Let's go to work.

623
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,990
And pitching up.

624
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:44,460
Pitch rate, 2.5 degrees per second.

625
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,130
Roger, Jack. We see you pitching around.

626
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:50,130
Keep an eye on that telemetry.

627
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,850
Roger that. lf Swigert can't dock...

628
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:55,570
this thing, we don't have a mission.

629
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:59,200
How's the alignment? - G.D.C. align.

630
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:06,780
Thrusting forward.

631
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,140
One hundred feet.

632
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,850
Watch the alignment, now.

633
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,300
Ah, don't worry, guys.

634
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,840
l'm on top of it.

635
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:36,110
FlDO, let me know when you're ready.

636
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:37,610
Okay, let's uplink that.

637
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:41,880
How we lookin'? - We're not there yet. Forty feet.

638
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:44,720
Twenty.

639
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:51,510
Come on, rookie, park that thing.

640
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,900
Ten feet.

641
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:12,490
Capture. - That's it.

642
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:16,670
Talk back is barber pole. - Go ahead and retract.

643
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:21,860
Houston, we have hard dock.

644
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,030
Roger, understand. That's a good deal, Jack.

645
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:27,770
Let's start back up with procedure 17.

646
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:31,340
Okay, Houston, we have LEM extraction.

647
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,410
We copy that, Thirteen.

648
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,710
Now you're off to the Fra Mauro highlands.

649
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:39,650
l gotta get out of this suit. - Houston, we are ready...

650
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,850
for the beginning of the P.T.C....

651
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:43,870
and l think once we're in that...

652
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:46,250
barbecue roll, uh, Jack and l will eat.

653
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,890
Hey, l'm hungry. - Are you sure?

654
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:52,730
l could eat the ass out of a dead rhinoceros.

655
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,770
We got a smooth one, huh? - By the numbers so far.

656
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:01,310
We just ran a minimum load test on the...

657
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:03,610
cooling system. Let me clean this up.

658
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:06,170
See you tomorrow. - Take care.

659
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,790
lt's too bad we can't demonstrate this on TV.

660
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:26,610
What a shame.

661
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,890
Okay. Overboard dump comin' up.

662
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,670
Here it comes...

663
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:41,810
the constellation Urion.

664
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:47,880
Now, that's a beautiful sight.

665
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:51,880
Barbara. Barbara, we are going to your father's broadcast.

666
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,550
No. l'm never coming out.

667
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:58,790
l hate Paul. No one else can ever play their records again.

668
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:02,220
She's still going on about the stupid Beatles breaking up?

669
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,160
They're not stupid. You're stupid. - Barbara.

670
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,660
l know you're in mourning.

671
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,130
l'm not going, Mom. Dad won't know if we're there.

672
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:11,810
The whole world is going to be watching...

673
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,740
this broadcast, and so are we.

674
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,840
Excuse me while l--

675
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:19,140
Okay, uh, good evening, America...

676
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,010
and welcome aboard Apollo 13.

677
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:26,020
l'm Jim Lovell, and we're broadcasting to you tonight...

678
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,950
from an altitude of almost 200,000 miles...

679
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:32,890
away from the face of the earth...

680
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:35,860
and we have a pretty good show in store for you tonight.

681
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,130
We are going to show you just what...

682
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:41,970
Susan. Barbara. - our life is like for the three of us...

683
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:44,800
in the vast expanse of outer space. - Double.

684
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,410
One of the first things we'd like to do...

685
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:51,740
is provide you with the appropriate background music.

686
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,450
So, uh, hit it there, Freddo.

687
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:57,810
Hello, world.

688
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,900
That, uh, was supposed to be the theme to 2001...

689
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,510
in honor of our command module Odyssey...

690
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:20,310
but there seems to have been a change in the program.

691
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,630
When l go up on 19, l'm gonna take my...

692
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:27,050
entire collection of Johnny Cash along.

693
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:31,570
Hey, Marilyn. - Where's their broadcast?

694
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,660
All the networks dumped us.

695
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,890
One of them said we made goin' to the moon...

696
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:40,050
as exciting as a trip to Pittsburgh.

697
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:43,230
My son's supposed to be on.

698
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:45,870
He's in outer space.

699
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:50,810
This is all the channels we get, Mrs. Lovell.

700
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,010
lt's that damn TV Guide again.

701
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:57,650
Ruthless porters.

702
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,790
Savage baggage masters--

703
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,900
Do they know they're not on the air?

704
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,540
We'll tell them when they get back.

705
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,640
Don't put your faith in love, my boy

706
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,380
My father said to me

707
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,410
Uh, well, if anyone from the, uh, l.R.S. is watching...

708
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,580
l forgot to file my 1040 return.

709
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,250
l meant to do it today, but, uh--

710
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:35,330
That's no joke. They'll jump on him.

711
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,500
Well, folks, let's head on down to the lunar excursion module.

712
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,000
Follow me.

713
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,730
Now, when we get ready to land on the moon...

714
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:48,810
Fred Haise and l will float through this access tunnel...

715
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:50,840
into the lunar module, leaving--

716
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,010
EECOM, that stir's gonna be...

717
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:57,680
on both H2 and both O2 tanks, is that correct?

718
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:01,100
...the spacecraft will remain connected.

719
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,990
Well, folks, as you can probably tell...

720
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,260
the Aquarius isn't much bigger than a couple of telephone booths.

721
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,830
The skin of the LEM in some places...

722
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:13,100
is only as...

723
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,730
as thick as a couple of layers...

724
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:17,430
of tinfoil, and that's all that...

725
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:19,270
protects us from the vacuum of space.

726
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:21,880
We get away with this because the LEM is...

727
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:24,310
designed only for flight in outer space.

728
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:28,450
Fred Haise, Renaissance man.

729
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:31,910
Okay, we'll head back up the tunnel now...

730
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:34,220
and back into the Odyssey.

731
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:42,060
All right, we've returned to the--

732
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,170
Stand by one, Houston.

733
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:47,600
Gotcha.

734
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,470
Houston, that bang you heard was

735
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:51,670
Fred Haise on the cabin repress valve.

736
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:55,940
He gets our hearts goin' every time with that one.

737
00:48:57,050 --> 00:49:02,050
Okay, we're, uh, about to close out the Aquarius...

738
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:04,820
and, uh, return to the Odyssey.

739
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,120
Our next broadcast will be from

740
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,860
Fra Mauro on the surface of the moon.

741
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:15,300
So, uh, this is the crew of the Apollo 13...

742
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,770
wishing everyone back on Earth a...

743
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:21,170
a pleasant evening.

744
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:27,640
All right.

745
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:30,680
Daddy was funny.

746
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:33,190
They might air a few minutes of it on the news tonight.

747
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:36,290
You'd think so.

748
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,360
Bye. - Bye.

749
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:42,760
Well, between Jack's back taxes and the Fred Haise Show...

750
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:46,270
l'd say that was a pretty successful broadcast.

751
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:49,940
That was an excellent show. - Thank you very much, Houston.

752
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,270
We've got a couple of housekeeping procedures.

753
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:57,110
We'd like you to roll right to 0-6-0 and null your rates.

754
00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:01,050
Roger that. Rolling right, 0-6-0.

755
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:09,020
And then if you could give your oxygen tanks a stir.

756
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,120
Roger that.

757
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:47,400
Hey, we've got a problem here.

758
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,100
What did you do? - Nothing. l stirred the tanks.

759
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,690
Whoa. - Hey.

760
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:58,640
Uh, this is Houston. Say again please.

761
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:03,820
Houston, we have a problem. We have a main bus B undervolt.

762
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,120
We've got a lot of thruster activity here.

763
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:11,360
lt just went off line. There's another master alarm.

764
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,430
l'm checking the quad. - That was no repress valve.

765
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:16,330
Maybe it's in quad C. l'm gonna reconfigure the R.C.S.

766
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:18,530
We've got a ping light. - The way these

767
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:20,330
We've got multiple caution and warning,

768
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:22,170
Houston. We've got to reset and restart.

769
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:24,570
l'm going to S.C.S.

770
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:29,510
Jesus. Flight, their heart rates are skyrocketing.

771
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:31,520
EECOM, what's your data telling you?

772
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,250
O2 tank two not reading at all.

773
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:36,950
Tank one is at 725 psi and falling.

774
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:40,590
Fuel cells one and three are, uh--

775
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:43,290
Oh, boy, what's going on here? Flight, let me get back to you.

776
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:46,430
Flight, GNC. They're all over the place.

777
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:48,080
They keep yawing close to gimbal lock.

778
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,270
l keep losing radio signal.

779
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:51,270
Flight, their antennae must be flipped around.

780
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:53,640
They're gonna have to do it manually if they do it at all.

781
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,270
One at a time, people.

782
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:57,320
ls this an instrumentation problem...

783
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,380
or are we looking at real power loss?

784
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,850
lt's reading a quadruple failure. That can't happen.

785
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:03,850
lt's got to be instrumentation.

786
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:05,080
Let's get the hatch buttoned.

787
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:06,750
The LEM might have been hit by a meteor.

788
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:09,790
The tunnel's really torquin' with all this movement.

789
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:11,580
Houston, we had a pretty large bang...

790
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,330
there associated with a master alarm.

791
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,960
Shit, it's main bus A.

792
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:20,970
Main bus A undervolt? - Main bus A undervolt down to--...

793
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:24,940
lt's reading 25 and a half. Main bus B is reading zip now.

794
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,170
We got a wicked shimmy up here.

795
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:29,940
These guys are talking about bangs and shimmies.

796
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,950
Doesn't sound like instrumentation.

797
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:34,750
You are breaking up, 13. - Can't get this hatch to seal.

798
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:39,250
Just stow it. lf we'd been hit by a meteor, we'd be dead by now.

799
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:41,360
l'm gonna try to get us out of this lurch.

800
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,090
Houston, did you say switch to omni Bravo?

801
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:45,370
Roger that, Thirteen.

802
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:47,400
The signal strength went way down.

803
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,400
lt's fighting me. What's the story? We keep flirting with gimbal lock.

804
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:55,440
We need a confirmation. What systems do you have down?

805
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:58,610
l'm having a hard time, Rick. - S.M.R.C.S. Helium one.

806
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:00,340
Did you say switch to omni Charlie?

807
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,540
A and C are barber pole.

808
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,480
Houston, l'm switching over quad C to main A.

809
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:05,980
Roger that, Thirteen.

810
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:09,250
Okay, Houston, fuel cell one, fuel cell three.

811
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:13,320
We got a main bus B undervolt, cryo pressure, suit compressor.

812
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:18,630
What don't we have? A.C. bus one, A.C. bus two...

813
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:21,970
command module computer and O2 flow high.

814
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:24,640
l don't know. Maybe this is a caution and warning failure.

815
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:29,840
Houston, we are venting something out into space.

816
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:35,420
l can see it outside of window one right now.

817
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:40,420
lt's definitely, uh... a gas of some sort.

818
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:45,450
lt's got to be the oxygen.

819
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:04,950
Roger, Odyssey. We copy your venting.

820
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:08,520
Give me an alignment. - Let's think about the kind...

821
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:13,630
Let's start back at the beginning. - Anything look abnormal?

822
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:26,160
Okay, listen up. Quiet down, people.

823
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:32,080
Quiet down. Quiet down. Let's stay cool, people.

824
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:35,250
Procedures, l need another computer up in the R.T.C.C.

825
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:38,080
l want everybody to alert your support teams.

826
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:40,920
Wake up anybody you need and get them in here.

827
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:43,260
Let's work the problem, people.

828
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,790
Let's not make things worse by guessin'.

829
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:48,070
13, this is Houston. We are going around...

830
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:50,100
the room. We're gonna get you answers.

831
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,930
We keep venting, we're gonna keep hitting

832
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:57,010
Take a look at the O2 on number one.

833
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:04,080
200 pounds and falling.

834
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:06,280
O2 tank two still zero.

835
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:07,930
Tank one: 218 psi and falling.

836
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:09,950
ls that what you're gettin'? Confirm.

837
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:14,460
We're seeing the same, 13. - Can we review our status, Sy?

838
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:19,220
Let's look at this thing from a standpoint of status.

839
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,630
What have we got on the spacecraft that's good?

840
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:30,470
l'll get back to you, Gene.

841
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:34,910
We're not gonna have power much longer.

842
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:38,460
The ship's bleedin' to death.

843
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:47,870
Flight? - Yeah. Go, EECOM.

844
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:50,680
Um, Flight, l recommend we shut down...

845
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:53,410
the reactant valves of the fuel cells.

846
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:56,910
What the hell good is that gonna do?

847
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:58,920
lf that's where the leak is, we can isolate it.

848
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:02,590
We can isolate it there, save what's left in the tanks,

849
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:04,590
You close 'em, you can't open 'em again.

850
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:07,230
You can't land on the moon with one healthy fuel cell.

851
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:10,560
Gene, the Odyssey is dying.

852
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:14,320
From my chair here, this is the last option.

853
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:25,100
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, Sy.

854
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:41,500
CAPCOM, let's have them close the reactant valves.

855
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,530
Thirteen, this is Houston.

856
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:47,390
We want you to close react valves...

857
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:50,240
on cells one and three. Do you copy?

858
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:54,540
Are you saying you want the whole smash?

859
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,720
Closing down the react valves for fuel cells shut down?

860
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:02,490
Shutting down the fuel cells? Did l hear you right?

861
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:05,390
Yeah, they heard me right.

862
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:07,060
Tell them we think that's...

863
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,190
the only way they can stop the leak.

864
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:14,990
Yeah, Jim. We think that closing the react valves may stop the leak.

865
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:27,440
Did he copy that? - Do you copy, Jim?

866
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:31,540
Yes, Houston, we copy.

867
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:40,890
We just lost the moon.

868
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:50,770
Okay, Freddo, shut those down.

869
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:54,600
Let's see what this does.

870
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:05,220
lf this doesn't work...

871
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:09,570
we're not gonna have enough power left to get home.

872
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:28,710
Shit. - Goddamn it.

873
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:32,130
Uh, Houston, O2 on one is still falling.

874
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:37,360
Freddo, how long does it take to power up the LEM?

875
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:39,560
Three hours by the checklist.

876
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:42,130
We don't have that much time.

877
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:44,260
Shit.

878
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,130
Okay, now, Jack, before the batteries...

879
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:49,370
completely die on us in here...

880
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:52,030
let's power down everything so we can...

881
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:54,370
save as much as we can for reentry.

882
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:56,410
Fifteen minutes of oxygen and that's it.

883
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:58,050
The command module will be dead.

884
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:01,220
Okay. Okay, guys, listen up. Here's the drill.

885
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,720
We're moving the astronauts over to the LEM.

886
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:05,720
We've got to get some oxygen up there.

887
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:07,610
TELMU, Control, l want emergency power...

888
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,220
procedure; essential hardware only.

889
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,580
GNC, EECOM, we're gonna be shutting down...

890
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,560
the command module at the same time.

891
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,860
We'll have to transfer the guidance...

892
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,230
system from one computer to the other...

893
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:17,890
so l want those numbers up and ready...

894
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:19,170
when our guys are in position.

895
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:21,570
We've gotta transfer all control data over the LEM computer...

896
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:23,570
before the command module dies.

897
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:26,040
The lunar module just became a lifeboat.

898
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:27,770
Odyssey, this is Houston.

899
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:30,380
We need you to power down immediately.

900
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,780
You're gonna have to power up the LEM at the same time, so you

901
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,720
We already have Freddo in the LEM, Houston.

902
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:39,220
We've got serious time pressure.

903
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,150
You've got to get...

904
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,730
the guidance program transferred...

905
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:43,110
and you've got to do it before you're...

906
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:44,400
out of power in the command module...

907
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,900
or you're not gonna be able to navigate up there.

908
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,970
How much time? Can you give me a number?

909
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:52,120
Well, we're looking at less than 15...

910
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:55,310
minutes of life support in the Odyssey.

911
00:59:55,410 --> 01:00:01,080
We've got 15 minutes, Freddo. lt's worse than l thought.

912
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,650
Houston, be aware l've moved...

913
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:06,890
from the command module into the LEM.

914
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:09,010
lf Jack can't get that guidance computer...

915
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:10,760
data transferred before they go dead--...

916
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,260
They won't even know which way they're pointed.

917
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:18,030
That's a bad way to fly. - l'll be in 210 if you need me.

918
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:21,970
Houston, this is Thirteen. Are you back with me now?

919
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:24,800
Aquarius, this is Houston. You now have...

920
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,770
about 12 minutes to power up.

921
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:28,910
l can't see any stars. Man, there's a...

922
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:31,050
lot of debris floatin' around out there.

923
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:35,220
Okay, Houston, l have completed the steps on page 15.

924
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,220
Now l'm ready to power down the computer.

925
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:40,690
l'm gonna need your gimbal angles, Jack...

926
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:43,920
before you shut down the computer.

927
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:44,990
Okay, Jim.

928
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:47,230
l need this back to me before they power down.

929
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:49,300
All right, all right. l got it. Hold on.

930
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:54,240
Houston, our computer is up. - Roger. Stand by.

931
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:58,910
Jack, we need to proceed with steps 12 through 17 quickly.

932
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:03,510
You're down to about eight minutes remaining.

933
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:05,920
Fuel cell pump's off. O2 fans, tank two off.

934
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:07,840
Okay, Houston, check me. l have...

935
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:09,920
completed these gimbal conversions...

936
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:13,590
but l need a double check of the arithmetic.

937
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:18,030
Yeah, you can go, Jim. - The roll CAL angle is minus two.

938
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:21,600
Lunar module roll is 355.57.

939
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:27,510
Pitch: 1678-- Correction. Pitch: 167.78.

940
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:32,550
Yaw is 351.87. - Stand by. We're checking it.

941
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:35,050
We've got negative visibility in our star field...

942
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,990
and if this paperwork isn't right,

943
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:41,320
who knows where we'll end up out here?

944
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:48,400
Looks good, Flight.

945
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,530
lt's all right. - Good here.

946
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:53,030
He's good, Andy. - We'll go on those numbers.

947
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:55,070
You're good. - Log them in, Freddo.

948
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:57,570
Jack, turn off the l.M.U. Switch to S.C.S.

949
01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:00,240
Stand by to turn off the thrusters. Over.

950
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:03,580
lt's a great day in New York. lt's girl watchers' weather.

951
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,420
l like those ingenious girl watchers who put on Con Edison helmets...

952
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:10,590
and dig trenches in the street to get a better view.

953
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:12,920
But l-- Hey, speaking of girl watching...

954
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,040
did you know that our first bachelor...

955
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:16,990
astronaut is on his way to the moon?

956
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:19,100
ls it Swigert? Yeah, first bachelor.

957
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,270
He's the kind, they say, has a girl...

958
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:23,430
in every port. He has that reputation.

959
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:26,370
He's sort of foolishly optimistic,

960
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:29,870
taking nylons, Hershey bars to the moon.

961
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:32,640
Did you read that three million--

962
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:35,950
What do you say? Less viewers or fewer viewers?

963
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:38,690
Three million fewer viewers, uh, watched...

964
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:41,050
the space shot than did the last one.

965
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:43,890
Uh, l-- Colonel Borman is h--

966
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:46,490
An ABC New--

967
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:50,230
Here is ABC science editor Jules Bergman.

968
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:53,900
The Apollo 13 spacecraft has lost all electrical power...

969
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,570
and astronauts Jim Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert...

970
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:59,110
are making their way through the tunnel to the lunar module...

971
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:00,740
using it as a lifeboat...

972
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,240
so they'll have electrical power...

973
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:03,910
for their radios on the command module.

974
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:07,280
Apollo 13 is apparently also losing breathing oxygen--

975
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:10,450
Slow down. An electrical failure. What exactly does that mean?

976
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:13,520
The emergency has ruled out any chance of a lunar landing...

977
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:16,260
and could endanger the lives of the astronauts themselves...

978
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:20,430
if the LEM oxygen supply, plus whatever is left...

979
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:23,200
can't last them until they can get back to Earth.

980
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,270
What do you mean there's no immediate danger?

981
01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:27,810
l just heard they're losing oxygen. Can they get back?

982
01:03:27,910 --> 01:03:29,600
The LEM's descent rocket engine...

983
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,640
will be used in aborting the mission...

984
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:33,880
and getting the astronauts safely back to Earth.

985
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:36,430
Recapping what has happened: The Apollo...

986
01:03:36,530 --> 01:03:38,680
13 astronauts may be in grave danger.

987
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:40,690
No, don't give me that NASA bullshit.

988
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:43,020
l want to know what's happening with my husband.

989
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,320
We want to switch control to the Aquarius now.

990
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:47,090
Roger that. - Houston, wait.

991
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:50,060
You're down to about five minutes now, Jack.

992
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,650
Be aware our R.C.S. isn't up here yet.

993
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:55,370
We have no attitude control on Aquarius.

994
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:58,740
They don't have control? Did we miss a step here?

995
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:03,340
Control, what the hell happened? - What? l don't know.

996
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:08,660
We're out of whack. l'm trying to pitch...

997
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,680
down, but we're yawing to the left.

998
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,690
Why can't l null this out?

999
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:15,560
She wasn't designed to fly attached like this.

1000
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:19,460
lt's like flying with a dead elephant on our back.

1001
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:22,430
Flight, Guidance. We're getting awfully close to center here.

1002
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:24,440
Watch that middle gimbal. We don't...

1003
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:26,240
want you tumbling off into space.

1004
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:28,000
Freddo, inform Houston l'm well aware...

1005
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,040
of the goddamn gimbals.

1006
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:31,070
Roger that, Houston.

1007
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:33,080
l don't need to hear the obvious.

1008
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:35,210
l've got the frappin' eight-ball in front of me.

1009
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:38,210
Aquarius, this is Houston. We've got you both on VOX.

1010
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:40,820
You want what? You want us to go to VOX?

1011
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,990
You have a hot mike. We are reading everything you say.

1012
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:46,090
Sorry, Jim.

1013
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:49,560
lt's only by a very narrow margin...

1014
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:53,760
that we're going to get Lovell, Haise and Swigert back alive.

1015
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:56,570
Marilyn?

1016
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:59,500
l'm sorry. Jeffrey's calling for you.

1017
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:03,580
...the terseness of Kraft and the grim lines of Jim McDivitt.

1018
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:09,030
This has been a very close call. We're not out of the woods yet.

1019
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:14,590
Jeffrey?

1020
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:18,020
Why are so many people here?

1021
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:23,960
Oh, well, you know... your dad's flying his mission.

1022
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:29,100
He said he was going to get me a moon rock.

1023
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:32,040
Right.

1024
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:35,540
Well...

1025
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:40,880
something broke on your daddy's spaceship...

1026
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:43,940
and he's gonna have to turn around...

1027
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,760
before he even gets to the moon.

1028
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:53,230
Was it the door?

1029
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:54,930
Thirteen, Houston. We still...

1030
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:56,030
show that venting pushing you around.

1031
01:05:56,130 --> 01:05:59,170
How you doing? - Houston, Aquarius.

1032
01:05:59,270 --> 01:06:01,850
We've had to learn how to fly all over...

1033
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:04,140
again, but we are doing better now.

1034
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:08,280
Uh, roger that, Aquarius. - Have him close it out.

1035
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:11,880
Jack, we can close out your procedure now.

1036
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:17,050
Do we know for sure that we can power this thing back up?

1037
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:19,960
lt's gonna get awfully cold in here.

1038
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,400
Copy that, Jack.

1039
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:24,930
We'll just have to deal with that later.

1040
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,200
Computer off. - We're clear.

1041
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:31,330
We're going to the LEM.

1042
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:37,700
We confirm shutdown, Jack. Lunar module now in control.

1043
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:47,040
Roger that, Houston. This is Odyssey signing off.

1044
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,940
Freddo, we're gonna have to execute some sort of burn.

1045
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,570
lt's just a matter of when.

1046
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:15,690
Did they shut us all down in there? - Yeah.

1047
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:19,120
Didn't think we'd be back in here so soon.

1048
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:23,290
Houston, how far off course do you project we are?

1049
01:07:23,390 --> 01:07:25,390
Over.

1050
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,670
Okay, people, listen up.

1051
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:33,640
Gentlemen, l want you all to forget the flight plan.

1052
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:37,680
From this moment on, we are improvising a new mission.

1053
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:41,650
Sorry about that.

1054
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:43,820
We'll get somebody to look at that. - Find a bulb around here.

1055
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:47,690
How do we get our people home?

1056
01:07:47,790 --> 01:07:49,690
They are here.

1057
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:52,190
Do we turn 'em around, straight back, direct abort?

1058
01:07:52,290 --> 01:07:54,230
Gene-- - l can't guarantee the burn yet.

1059
01:07:54,330 --> 01:07:57,530
No, sir, no, sir, no, sir.

1060
01:07:57,630 --> 01:07:59,700
We get them on a free-return trajectory.

1061
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,340
lt's the option with the fewest question marks for safety.

1062
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,690
l agree with Jerry. We use the moon's...

1063
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:06,640
gravity to slingshot them around.

1064
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:09,980
The LEM will not support three guys for that amount of time.

1065
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,060
We've got to do a direct abort. We do an...

1066
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,920
about-face, bring the guys right home.

1067
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:16,120
Get 'em back soon. Absolutely.

1068
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:18,150
We don't even know if the Odyssey's engine's working.

1069
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:20,160
lf there's been serious damage to this spacecraft--

1070
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:22,160
They blow up and they die.

1071
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:24,230
That is not the argument. We are talking about time.

1072
01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:27,430
l'm not gonna sugarcoat this for you.

1073
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:30,370
Okay, hold it. Let's hold it down.

1074
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:32,000
Let's hold it down. The only engine...

1075
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:33,670
with enough power for a direct abort...

1076
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:36,170
is the S.P.S. on the service module.

1077
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:37,410
From what Lovell has told us, it could...

1078
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:38,510
have been damaged in an explosion...

1079
01:08:38,610 --> 01:08:40,510
so let's consider that engine dead.

1080
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:42,510
We light that thing up, could blow the whole works.

1081
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:45,120
lt's just too risky. We're not gonna take that chance.

1082
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:47,620
About the only thing the command module is good for is reentry.

1083
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,300
That leaves us with the LEM,

1084
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,390
which means free-return trajectory.

1085
01:08:51,490 --> 01:08:54,260
Once we get the guys around the moon...

1086
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:56,700
we'll fire up the LEM engine, make a long burn...

1087
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:57,640
pick up some speed...

1088
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:59,230
and get 'em home as quick as we can.

1089
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:00,920
Gene, l'm wondering what...

1090
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:03,040
the Grumman guys think about this.

1091
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:05,140
We can't make any guarantees. We...

1092
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:07,470
designed the LEM to land on the moon...

1093
01:09:07,570 --> 01:09:09,880
not fire the engine out there for course corrections.

1094
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:13,980
Well, unfortunately, we're not landing on the moon, are we?

1095
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,760
l don't care what anything was designed...

1096
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:19,090
to do. l care about what it can do.

1097
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:23,550
Let's get to work. Let's lay it out, okay?

1098
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:27,020
CAPCOM. Flight, he says it will be ready in time.

1099
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,080
After this burn, we've got to build...

1100
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:31,190
some time in the flight plan for sleep.

1101
01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:35,170
Run it by the F.A.O. - l've run it by the F.A.O.

1102
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:36,630
Do we know how long we're gonna fire that burn?

1103
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:39,970
He specifically wanted a quote from a flight director.

1104
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:42,140
The President. - The President?

1105
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,810
Nixon. He wants odds.

1106
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:47,150
We are not losing the crew.

1107
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:50,150
l gotta give him odds. Five to one against?

1108
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:52,150
Three to one? - l don't think they're that good.

1109
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:55,280
We are not losing those men.

1110
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,160
How long are they gonna have to burn the engine?

1111
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:05,750
Look, tell him... three to one.

1112
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:11,170
Expect loss of signal in less than one minute.

1113
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:14,840
When we pick you back up we will have your P.C. plus two burn data.

1114
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:17,660
Roger that, Houston. We'll hear...

1115
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,170
from you again at acquisition of signal.

1116
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:23,620
You wanna look?

1117
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:29,120
Oh, look at that.

1118
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:31,220
Wow.

1119
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:40,500
Aquarius, that's 30 seconds until loss of signal.

1120
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:46,840
Mare Tranquillitatis.

1121
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:50,150
Neil and Buzz's old neighborhood.

1122
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:52,480
Comin' up on Mount Marilyn.

1123
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:56,490
Jim, you gotta take a look at this.

1124
01:10:56,590 --> 01:10:58,920
l've seen it.

1125
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:06,330
Aquarius, this is Houston.

1126
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:11,340
We expect loss of signal in approximately ten seconds.

1127
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:15,010
So long, Earth. Catch you on the flip side.

1128
01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:24,680
When you go into the shadow of the moon...

1129
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:27,190
and the moon is between you and the sun...

1130
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:29,250
you see stars that are more brilliant...

1131
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:30,960
than anything you've ever seen...

1132
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:33,130
on the clearest nights here on Earth.

1133
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:36,820
And then you pass into the lunar sunrise...

1134
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:38,800
over the lunar surface.

1135
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:41,140
lt must be an awe-inspiring sight.

1136
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,940
l-l-l can't wait to see it myself.

1137
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,980
The problem now is not so much a...

1138
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,310
question of an adequate oxygen supply...

1139
01:11:48,410 --> 01:11:50,380
but it is the rate of consumption of water...

1140
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,650
which is vitally needed for the cooling operations...

1141
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:57,740
to maintain the electronic systems and so forth.

1142
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:37,460
Look, it's Fra Mauro.

1143
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:40,290
l can see our landing site.

1144
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:44,040
Wow.

1145
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:48,370
Look at the Tsiolkovskii crater.

1146
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:52,810
l can't believe how bright the ejecta blanket is.

1147
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:56,480
lt's like snow. lt's beautiful.

1148
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:59,750
That's Mare lmbrium to the north.

1149
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,860
Thirteen, this is Houston.

1150
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:08,930
We're reading your telemetry. lt's good to see you again.

1151
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:11,470
Good to see you too, Houston.

1152
01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:13,000
We are picking you up at...

1153
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:15,140
a velocity of 7,062 feet per second...

1154
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:19,510
at a distance from the moon of 56 nautical miles.

1155
01:14:19,610 --> 01:14:22,810
Stand by for your P.C. plus two burn data.

1156
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:25,040
l had an itch to take...

1157
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:28,320
this baby down, do some prospectin'.

1158
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:31,820
Damn, we were close.

1159
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:36,650
Gentlemen, what are your intentions?

1160
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:42,500
l'd like to go home.

1161
01:14:44,570 --> 01:14:46,970
We got a burn coming up.

1162
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:49,970
We're gonna need a contingency if we lose comm with Houston.

1163
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:54,580
Freddo, let's get an idea where we stand on the consumables.

1164
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,580
Jack, get into the Odyssey...

1165
01:14:56,680 --> 01:15:01,700
and bag up all the water you can before it freezes in there.

1166
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,020
Let's go home.

1167
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:08,460
Aquarius, we got some P.C. plus two burn data for you fellas.

1168
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:13,800
So you're telling me you can only give our guys 45 hours?

1169
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:17,860
That brings them to about there.

1170
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:22,640
Gentlemen, that's not acceptable.

1171
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:26,180
Gene, Gene, we've got to talk about power.

1172
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:29,280
Whoa, whoa, guys. Power is everything.

1173
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:31,790
Power is everything. - What do you mean?

1174
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:34,960
Without it, they don't talk to us, they don't correct their trajectory...

1175
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:36,960
they don't turn the heat shield around.

1176
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:39,290
We gotta turn everything off, now.

1177
01:15:39,390 --> 01:15:41,830
They're not gonna make it to reentry.

1178
01:15:41,930 --> 01:15:45,370
What do you mean, 'everything'? - With everything on,

1179
01:15:45,470 --> 01:15:49,810
At that rate, in 16 hours the batteries are dead, not 45.

1180
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:50,740
And so is the crew.

1181
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,370
We gotta get them down to 12 amps.

1182
01:15:52,470 --> 01:15:54,410
Twelve amps? - How many?

1183
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:56,810
You can't run a vacuum cleaner on 12 amps, John.

1184
01:15:56,910 --> 01:16:00,480
We gotta turn off-- We have to turn off the radars, cabin heater...

1185
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:01,290
instrument displays,

1186
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,820
the guidance computer, the whole smash.

1187
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:03,950
Whoa. Guidance computer.

1188
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:05,660
What if they need to do another burn?

1189
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:08,330
They won't even know which way they're pointed.

1190
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:11,160
The more time we talk, the more juice they waste.

1191
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:14,150
That's the deal? - That's the deal.

1192
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:21,040
Okay, John. The minute we finish...

1193
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:23,580
the burn, we'll power down the LEM.

1194
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,680
All right.

1195
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:28,110
Now in the meantime, we're gonna have...

1196
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:30,120
a frozen command module up there.

1197
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:31,920
We're gonna have to power it up using...

1198
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:33,450
nothing but the reentry batteries.

1199
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:35,000
That's never been tried.

1200
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:37,360
We've never even simulated it before.

1201
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,630
Well, we're gonna have to figure it out.

1202
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:43,430
l want people in our simulators working reentry scenarios.

1203
01:16:43,530 --> 01:16:45,390
l want you to find every engineer who...

1204
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:47,300
designed every switch, every circuit...

1205
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,270
and every light bulb that's up there.

1206
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:51,100
Then talk to the guy in the assembly...

1207
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,710
line who actually built the thing.

1208
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:54,540
Find out how to squeeze every amp...

1209
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,480
out of both of these goddamn machines.

1210
01:16:56,580 --> 01:17:01,820
l want this mark all the way back to Earth with time to spare.

1211
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,820
We never lost an American in space.

1212
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,320
We're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch.

1213
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:08,550
Failure is not an option.

1214
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:14,880
Ken?

1215
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:17,250
Ken?

1216
01:17:17,350 --> 01:17:20,250
What? Huh? - Good, you're not dead.

1217
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:23,120
l've been trying to get in touch with you for 45 minutes.

1218
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:25,220
Jesus, John, what are you doing here?

1219
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,230
l gotta get you in the simulators. We got a ship to land.

1220
01:17:27,330 --> 01:17:29,530
What? - There's been an explosion.

1221
01:17:29,630 --> 01:17:31,420
Oxygen tanks are gone. Two fuel cells...

1222
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,900
gone. Command module shut down.

1223
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,900
What about the crew? - Crew's fine so far.

1224
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,070
Trying to keep them alive in the LEM.

1225
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:41,080
We're gonna have to shut that down pretty soon too.

1226
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:44,240
We got a lot of people working the numbers on this one, Ken.

1227
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:45,620
Nobody's too sure how much power...

1228
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:47,080
we're gonna have when we hit reentry.

1229
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:50,090
The command module's gonna be frozen up pretty good by then.

1230
01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:54,920
You see this ammeter rise over 20 at any point, power-up is no good.

1231
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:57,260
We see it spike, that's sayonara for the guidance computer.

1232
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,430
Our guys can't reenter. Okay?

1233
01:17:59,530 --> 01:18:01,430
How much power do we have to play with?

1234
01:18:01,530 --> 01:18:03,770
Barely enough to run this coffee pot for nine hours.

1235
01:18:03,870 --> 01:18:06,100
Go. - Yeah, Ken Mattingly just got here.

1236
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,840
Copy. He's here.

1237
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:11,110
They've been losing heat since the accident.

1238
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:12,530
They're gonna start getting water...

1239
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:13,910
condensation on the control panels.

1240
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:17,280
Ken, glad you're here. You know what's going on?

1241
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:18,770
What do we have left in the batteries?

1242
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:19,620
We don't really know.

1243
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,950
We gotta get started on some shortcuts for power-up.

1244
01:18:22,050 --> 01:18:23,450
You know how short?

1245
01:18:23,550 --> 01:18:27,290
lt's all in the sequencing. lf we can skip whatever...

1246
01:18:27,390 --> 01:18:30,230
turn things on in the right order, maybe--...

1247
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:33,730
You started on a procedure? - The engineers have tried,

1248
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:36,670
We gotta get you in there. - Okay.

1249
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:39,400
Frank, l need the sim cold and dark.

1250
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:40,870
Give me the exact same conditions...

1251
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:41,910
they've got in there now.

1252
01:18:42,010 --> 01:18:44,580
l need present status of every instrument.

1253
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:47,910
l need a flashlight. That's not what they have up there.

1254
01:18:48,010 --> 01:18:50,080
Don't give me anything they don't have on board.

1255
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:54,590
Let's get this show on the road. Put him in space, fellas.

1256
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:57,590
Okay, Houston, the quad heater circuit breakers are open.

1257
01:18:57,690 --> 01:18:59,590
Copy that.

1258
01:18:59,690 --> 01:19:02,430
We're using the forward omni when the earth's in the window...

1259
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:05,270
and we're switching to aft omni when we see the moon.

1260
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:07,270
We copy that, Thirteen.

1261
01:19:07,370 --> 01:19:09,940
Aquarius, we don't want you to make any more waste dumps.

1262
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:12,770
The venting may push you off course.

1263
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:15,940
Oh, Christ. - What's up?

1264
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:20,280
No more waste dumps. We're just gonna have to store it.

1265
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:22,320
Jack, we're gonna need some more urine bags.

1266
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:26,990
Okay, Houston, that leaves us with just the computer...

1267
01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:31,930
which l'm shutting down now.

1268
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:38,640
And that's it.

1269
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:42,900
We just put Sir lsaac Newton in the driver's seat.

1270
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:49,480
ls it A.M. or P.M.?

1271
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:52,980
A.M. Very, very A.M.

1272
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:55,650
Haise is running a temperature, and none of them has slept.

1273
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,780
l can't order these guys to go to sleep.

1274
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,120
Could you sleep up there?

1275
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:03,330
lt's gonna get awful cold in there for those guys.

1276
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:07,500
Gene, we have a situation brewing with the carbon dioxide.

1277
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,940
We got a CO2 filter problem on the lunar module.

1278
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:11,330
Five filters on the LEM.

1279
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:13,510
Meant for 2 guys for a day and a half.

1280
01:20:13,610 --> 01:20:14,270
l told the doc--

1281
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:16,010
They're already up to 8 on the gauges.

1282
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:19,280
Anything over 15 and you get impaired judgment, blackouts...

1283
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:22,820
beginnings of brain asphyxia. - What about the scrubbers...

1284
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:27,360
They take square cartridges. - The ones on the LEM are round.

1285
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:30,160
Tell me this isn't a government operation.

1286
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:32,890
This just isn't a contingency we've remotely looked at.

1287
01:20:32,990 --> 01:20:35,130
Those CO2 levels are gonna be getting toxic.

1288
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:38,110
l suggest you invent a way to put...

1289
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:41,360
a square peg in a round hole rapidly.

1290
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:46,480
Okay, people, listen up.

1291
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:48,590
The people upstairs have handed us...

1292
01:20:48,690 --> 01:20:50,650
this one, and we gotta come through.

1293
01:20:50,750 --> 01:20:54,820
We gotta find a way to make this...

1294
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:57,660
fit into the hole for this...

1295
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:00,350
using nothing but that.

1296
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:04,500
Let's get it organized. - Okay, let's build a filter.

1297
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:07,700
Better get some coffee going too, someone.

1298
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:10,500
The Haise family lives in El Lago, Texas.

1299
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,340
His wife, Mary, is from Biloxi, Mississippi.

1300
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,340
When Fred Haise was growing up in Biloxi...

1301
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,510
he may have looked ahead to a fine family...

1302
01:21:17,610 --> 01:21:19,510
but he never dreamt of flying.

1303
01:21:19,610 --> 01:21:22,010
l'd never flown really before l went into the service...

1304
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:24,420
and l only went into the flying business...

1305
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,390
as a means to getting a commission.

1306
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:29,460
Good morning. - Henry. Don't you ever sleep?

1307
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:32,590
l have a request from the news people.

1308
01:21:32,690 --> 01:21:33,660
Uh-huh.

1309
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:37,590
They want to put a transmitter up on the lawn.

1310
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,300
Transmitter?

1311
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,890
lt's kind of a tower for a live broadcast.

1312
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:50,330
They didn't care about this mission.

1313
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:52,580
They didn't even run Jim's show.

1314
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:57,090
Well... it's more dramatic now. Suddenly people are--

1315
01:21:57,190 --> 01:22:00,660
Landing on the moon wasn't dramatic enough for them.

1316
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:04,990
Look, l, um, realize how hard this is, Marilyn...

1317
01:22:05,090 --> 01:22:07,160
but the whole world is caught up in it.

1318
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:09,930
lt's the biggest story since-- - No, Henry.

1319
01:22:10,030 --> 01:22:14,840
Those people don't put one piece of equipment on my lawn.

1320
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:16,680
lf they have a problem with that,

1321
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:18,680
they can take it up with my husband.

1322
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:21,210
He'll be home on Friday.

1323
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:32,290
When you are sad and lonely

1324
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:34,460
And have no place to go

1325
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:35,930
And have no place to go

1326
01:22:36,030 --> 01:22:41,440
Come to see me, baby and bring along some dough

1327
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:47,180
And we'll go honky tonkin' Honky tonkin'

1328
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:51,420
Honky tonkin', honey baby

1329
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:56,780
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town

1330
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:06,770
Hey, Freddo.

1331
01:23:06,870 --> 01:23:10,900
lt's too cold in there.

1332
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,130
Yeah.

1333
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:26,480
That's a nice one of Mary.

1334
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:32,590
You don't look too good, Freddo. - l'll survive.

1335
01:23:32,690 --> 01:23:35,560
There's aspirin in the medical kit. - l took some.

1336
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:37,930
Jim, l'm all right.

1337
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:46,580
lt was an accident, Mary gettin' pregnant.

1338
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:51,750
You should have seen the look on my face when she told me.

1339
01:23:51,850 --> 01:23:54,890
Well, that has a tendency to happen.

1340
01:23:54,990 --> 01:23:58,110
Yeah.

1341
01:24:02,690 --> 01:24:05,500
l wonder if it's a boy or a girl.

1342
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:08,830
You're gonna find out soon enough.

1343
01:24:08,930 --> 01:24:11,800
Sure.

1344
01:24:14,870 --> 01:24:18,080
l never dreamed l'd ever get to do something like this:

1345
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:20,680
come up here on a real mission.

1346
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:24,450
Most of the guys l graduated high school with...

1347
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:27,020
never even left home, and here l am.

1348
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:32,350
Oh, yeah... here you are.

1349
01:24:35,660 --> 01:24:38,300
lt hurts when l urinate.

1350
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:41,470
Well, you're not gettin' enough water.

1351
01:24:41,570 --> 01:24:46,410
l'm drinking my ration the same as you.

1352
01:24:46,510 --> 01:24:50,740
l think old Swigert gave me the clap.

1353
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:55,750
He's been pissin' in my relief tube.

1354
01:24:55,850 --> 01:24:58,190
Well... that will be a hot one at...

1355
01:24:58,290 --> 01:25:00,760
the debriefing for the flight surgeon.

1356
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:06,600
That's another first for America's space program.

1357
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:07,930
Listen, um... l've been going... over some stuff...

1358
01:25:08,030 --> 01:25:12,300
Listen, um... l've been going... over some stuff...

1359
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:15,620
and l'm a little worried about this cold...

1360
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:18,180
affecting our battery efficiency.

1361
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,260
We quit heatin' the glycol to save...

1362
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,450
water and power, so that's not helping.

1363
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:24,450
lt could cost us amp hours on the back end?

1364
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:25,480
That's a possibility.

1365
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:27,350
l've been goin' over the numbers again.

1366
01:25:27,450 --> 01:25:30,490
Have they called up with a reentry plan yet?

1367
01:25:30,590 --> 01:25:31,870
We're comin' in too shallow and fast.

1368
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:33,220
We're workin' on something. Hold on.

1369
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:35,230
l can't remember the ratio to temperature.

1370
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:37,230
We got no references on board.

1371
01:25:37,330 --> 01:25:39,230
Let's see if Houston can pull up the mill specs.

1372
01:25:39,330 --> 01:25:41,310
Listen, listen. They gave us too much

1373
01:25:41,410 --> 01:25:43,270
Delta V. They had us burn too long.

1374
01:25:43,370 --> 01:25:46,570
At this rate we're gonna skip right out of the atmosphere,

1375
01:25:46,670 --> 01:25:50,040
What are you talkin' about? How'd you figure that?

1376
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:52,140
l can add.

1377
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:57,550
They've got half the Ph.D. s on the planet working on this.

1378
01:25:57,650 --> 01:25:59,750
What if they made a mistake and there was no way to reverse it?

1379
01:25:59,850 --> 01:26:01,690
Do you think they would tell us?

1380
01:26:01,790 --> 01:26:03,310
There's no reason to tell us.

1381
01:26:03,410 --> 01:26:05,190
What do you mean? That's bullshit.

1382
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:07,760
There's a thousand things that have to happen in order.

1383
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:12,940
We are on number eight. You're talking about number 692.

1384
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:16,100
ln the meantime, l'm trying to tell you we're coming in too fast.

1385
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,730
l think they know it, and that's why...

1386
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:19,270
we don't have a goddamn reentry plan.

1387
01:26:19,370 --> 01:26:21,410
That's duly noted. Thank you, Jack.

1388
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:24,050
Ow.

1389
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:26,050
Goddamn this piece of shit. - Hey.

1390
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:28,380
This piece of shit's gonna get you home.

1391
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:32,160
That's because that's the only thing we got left, Jack.

1392
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:36,730
What are you saying, Fred? - l think you know what l'm saying.

1393
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:40,500
Now wait a minute. All l did was stir those tanks.

1394
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,500
What was that gauge reading before you hit the switch?

1395
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:43,790
Don't tell me how to fly the damn C.M..

1396
01:26:43,890 --> 01:26:44,570
You don't know, do you?

1397
01:26:44,670 --> 01:26:46,070
They brought me in to do a job.

1398
01:26:46,170 --> 01:26:48,610
They asked me to stir the tanks, and l stirred the tanks.

1399
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:52,580
Stop kicking yourself in the ass. - This is not my fault.

1400
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:54,580
No one is saying it is.

1401
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:57,780
lf l'm in the left-hand seat when the call comes up, l stir the tanks.

1402
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,350
Yeah, well, tell him that.

1403
01:26:59,450 --> 01:27:02,660
l just asked you what the gauge was readin', and you don't know.

1404
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,720
Look, we're not doing this. We are not gonna do this.

1405
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:07,260
We're not gonna go bouncing off the walls for ten minutes...

1406
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,900
because we're just gonna end up right...

1407
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,260
back here with the same problems.

1408
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:13,490
Try to figure out how to stay alive.

1409
01:27:13,670 --> 01:27:16,000
Aquarius, this is Houston.

1410
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:18,870
Are we on VOX? - No, we're not on VOX.

1411
01:27:18,970 --> 01:27:21,510
Yeah, Houston, this is Aquarius. Go ahead.

1412
01:27:21,610 --> 01:27:27,310
Yeah, Jim, could you check your CO2 gauge for us?

1413
01:27:28,950 --> 01:27:31,520
Yeah, Houston, we were just looking at that.

1414
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:33,620
Our CO2 measurement has jumped...

1415
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,520
four notches in the last hour.

1416
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:36,560
That can't be right.

1417
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:38,490
l went over those numbers three times.

1418
01:27:38,590 --> 01:27:42,400
Jim, that sounds about right. We were expecting that.

1419
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:45,740
That's very comforting, Houston. What do we do about it?

1420
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:50,410
We're working on a procedure down here for you.

1421
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:52,910
Do you copy? - Oh, Christ.

1422
01:27:53,010 --> 01:27:55,080
All right, Houston, we're standing by for those procedures.

1423
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:58,420
Christ, l know why my numbers are wrong.

1424
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:01,320
l only figured it for two people.

1425
01:28:04,690 --> 01:28:08,430
Maybe l should just hold my breath.

1426
01:28:08,530 --> 01:28:10,790
The deadly CO2 gas is poisoning the...

1427
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:13,270
astronauts with every breath in and out.

1428
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:16,370
Heads up. Heads up.

1429
01:28:16,470 --> 01:28:19,940
Oh. Go, go, go, go. - Someone get that. Damn.

1430
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:22,590
Heads up, people. Look out now.

1431
01:28:25,210 --> 01:28:28,710
What's this? - That's what they gotta make.

1432
01:28:28,810 --> 01:28:31,120
l hope you got the procedures for me.

1433
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:32,220
Right here.

1434
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:34,320
That's it?

1435
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:38,060
All right, Aquarius, this is Houston.

1436
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:40,060
Do you have a flight plan?

1437
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:43,230
Affirmative, Andy. Jack's got one right here.

1438
01:28:43,330 --> 01:28:47,200
Okay, we have an unusual procedure for you here.

1439
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:49,200
We need you to rip the cover off.

1440
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:51,740
He wants you to rip the cover off the flight plan.

1441
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:54,940
With pleasure.

1442
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,310
The other materials you're gonna need here are...

1443
01:28:57,410 --> 01:28:59,320
a lithium hydroxide canister-- - Two, two.

1444
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:01,580
Two lithium hydroxide canisters. l'm sorry.

1445
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:04,120
A roll of gray tape. - Duct tape.

1446
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:09,290
Duct tape. You need an L.C.G. bag-- Two L.C.G. bags.

1447
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:10,960
The red suit hoses,

1448
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:14,200
and you've got the flight plan cover.

1449
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:17,900
Can you give me a timetable? - Henry. Henry.

1450
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,140
What about their level of carbon dioxide?

1451
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:22,440
lt's, uh, climbing.

1452
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:26,140
You're saying that they're almost out of breathable air?

1453
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:28,910
Wait a second. That's not what he said.

1454
01:29:29,010 --> 01:29:30,920
He said we're working on it.

1455
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:34,650
You want to cut the duct tape three feet long.

1456
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:36,860
Tell him to use his arm. - Just use your arm.

1457
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:37,970
lt's a good arm length.

1458
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:39,790
l see what you're getting at. Hold on.

1459
01:29:39,890 --> 01:29:42,960
Jack, tear that piece of tape down the middle lengthwise.

1460
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:45,530
All right? - Hold on, Houston.

1461
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:48,770
While the astronauts appear to have...

1462
01:29:48,870 --> 01:29:50,300
enough oxygen to keep them alive...

1463
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:53,640
one thing they have too much of is carbon dioxide.

1464
01:29:53,740 --> 01:29:55,640
With each breath, the three men expel...

1465
01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:58,980
more of the poisonous gas into the lunar module cockpit...

1466
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:01,880
and the scrubbers intended to keep the atmosphere breathable...

1467
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:04,620
are quickly becoming saturated.

1468
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:08,290
Oh, shit. l tore it.

1469
01:30:08,390 --> 01:30:11,690
Shit.

1470
01:30:11,790 --> 01:30:16,200
Houston, what do we do if we ripped the bag? Can we tape it?

1471
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:18,330
They just tore the bag. - Oh, no.

1472
01:30:18,430 --> 01:30:20,500
Uh, stand by. What should l tell 'em to do?

1473
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:22,410
They should have one more.

1474
01:30:22,510 --> 01:30:25,180
But they've still got a long way to come.

1475
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:27,560
They are now working on their backup...

1476
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:29,950
facilities, their emergency facilities.

1477
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:35,830
The problem is, if anything more goes wrong, they're in real trouble.

1478
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:07,320
As most of you are aware, there is no rescue possible in space flight.

1479
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:09,090
A-Any rescue system the space agency...

1480
01:31:09,190 --> 01:31:10,320
has long since calculated--

1481
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:12,330
Hold this a minute.

1482
01:31:12,430 --> 01:31:17,100
Since any rescue system the space agency calculated--...

1483
01:31:20,470 --> 01:31:23,170
One sock. - Once you...

1484
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:25,910
we're gonna want you to bungee... - Work it in.

1485
01:31:26,010 --> 01:31:28,280
the entire filter assembly to the bulkhead...

1486
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:31,950
right above the LEM canister. - We're getting close to 15.

1487
01:31:32,050 --> 01:31:34,640
So how does this flight compare to other...

1488
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:36,790
emergency situations you've faced?

1489
01:31:36,890 --> 01:31:41,460
l'd have to say that this is the most serious situation...

1490
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:44,330
we've ever encountered in manned space flight.

1491
01:31:44,430 --> 01:31:48,470
Houston, filter's in place. - Cabin gas return to egress.

1492
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:50,800
Suit circuit relief to close.

1493
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:55,310
CO2 canister select to secondary. - All right.

1494
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:58,480
Here goes.

1495
01:31:58,580 --> 01:32:01,550
l can hear air moving.

1496
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:15,390
Just breathe normal, fellas.

1497
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:21,340
Aquarius, please advise on CO2 status.

1498
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:26,110
Yeah, Houston, we're taking a look at those numbers now.

1499
01:32:27,210 --> 01:32:30,480
We're still holding close to 15, Houston.

1500
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:32,910
Roger that. Standing by.

1501
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:48,630
Houston, the CO2 level has dropped to nine...

1502
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:52,500
and it is still falling.

1503
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:55,470
Yes. - Great. Good job, you guys.

1504
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:58,140
That is good to hear, Aquarius.

1505
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:02,010
And you, sir, are a steely-eyed missile man.

1506
01:33:05,450 --> 01:33:08,510
Okay, spacecraft control to computer.

1507
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:11,720
Damn.

1508
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:15,490
Damn.

1509
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:17,760
We overloaded.

1510
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:19,770
We used way too much power.

1511
01:33:19,870 --> 01:33:23,670
There must be a sneak circuit between step seven and ten.

1512
01:33:23,770 --> 01:33:29,280
Which one has the leak? - Don't know that yet, John.

1513
01:33:29,380 --> 01:33:30,990
The sequence was wrong. We just have to...

1514
01:33:31,090 --> 01:33:32,380
go back and try 'em one at a time.

1515
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:35,620
You need a break, Ken?

1516
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:38,950
lf they don't get one, l don't get one.

1517
01:33:42,890 --> 01:33:45,460
Well, if it won't work, get me another one.

1518
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:48,800
My son's supposed to be on. - l know, Mrs. Lovell.

1519
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:50,010
Hi, Blanch.

1520
01:33:50,110 --> 01:33:53,970
They can't fix a thing in this place.

1521
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:56,970
Blanch, it's Marilyn.

1522
01:33:57,070 --> 01:33:59,140
Hi, Grandma.

1523
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:04,380
l was gonna see Jimmy. - l know. l know.

1524
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:08,480
We came to tell you something.

1525
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:13,490
There's been an accident. Jimmy's okay. He's all right.

1526
01:34:13,590 --> 01:34:17,930
But he's not gonna get to walk on the moon.

1527
01:34:18,030 --> 01:34:21,300
Well, they said he was.

1528
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,330
l know. l know.

1529
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:27,610
Um... that was before.

1530
01:34:27,710 --> 01:34:31,410
Now there's been an explosion, and they're all okay.

1531
01:34:31,510 --> 01:34:35,680
They're all right. But now they're just going to...

1532
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:39,350
try to figure out a way to get them home.

1533
01:34:39,450 --> 01:34:44,960
And--

1534
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:48,960
And it's a little bit dangerous.

1535
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:52,400
Oh, sweetie.

1536
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,630
Are you scared?

1537
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:03,480
Well, don't you worry, honey.

1538
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:08,150
lf they could get a washing machine to fly...

1539
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:11,510
my Jimmy could land it.

1540
01:35:13,940 --> 01:35:18,810
You saw me standing alone

1541
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:28,250
Without a dream in my heart

1542
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:37,220
Without a love of my own

1543
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:53,910
Jack, you'll be happy to hear we contacted President Nixon...

1544
01:35:54,010 --> 01:35:55,490
and he's gonna grant you...

1545
01:35:55,590 --> 01:35:57,590
an extension on your income taxes...

1546
01:35:57,690 --> 01:36:02,590
since you are most decidedly out of the country.

1547
01:36:02,690 --> 01:36:05,260
Roger that, Houston.

1548
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:08,130
That's wonderful news.

1549
01:36:08,230 --> 01:36:10,470
Tell them they have to sleep.

1550
01:36:10,570 --> 01:36:12,830
Haise is running a fever of 104.

1551
01:36:12,930 --> 01:36:16,540
Thirteen, we've had another request from the flight surgeon...

1552
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,540
that you fellas get more sleep.

1553
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:21,780
He doesn't like his readings down here.

1554
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:23,950
Let's see how he feels about this.

1555
01:36:24,050 --> 01:36:27,250
l am sick and tired of the entire western world...

1556
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:32,660
knowing how my kidneys are functioning.

1557
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:37,090
Flight, l just lost Lovell.

1558
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:44,370
Uh, Thirteen, this is Houston.

1559
01:36:44,470 --> 01:36:48,010
Jim, we just had a dropout on your bio-med sensors.

1560
01:36:48,110 --> 01:36:52,270
l'm not wearing my bio-med sensors, Houston.

1561
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:05,120
Okay, Jim. Copy that.

1562
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:23,080
Now l'm losing all three of 'em.

1563
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:25,780
lt's just a little medical mutiny, Doc.

1564
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:27,980
l'm sure the guys are still with us.

1565
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:31,250
Let's cut 'em some slack, okay?

1566
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:47,030
lt's not the velocity, it's the angle.

1567
01:37:47,130 --> 01:37:48,940
Maybe they're still venting something...

1568
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:50,700
that's throwing off the trajectory...

1569
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,710
but we are definitely shallowing again.

1570
01:37:52,810 --> 01:37:56,380
We are up to a 5.9. - Damn it.

1571
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,330
At this rate, they nick the earth's...

1572
01:37:58,430 --> 01:38:00,230
atmosphere and bounce off into space.

1573
01:38:00,330 --> 01:38:01,660
We need another burn to get them back in the corridor.

1574
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:03,790
Another burn. Copy that.

1575
01:38:03,890 --> 01:38:07,200
Fire the engines and get 'em on course.

1576
01:38:24,790 --> 01:38:27,020
Aquarius, this is Houston.

1577
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:30,630
Houston, Aquarius.

1578
01:38:30,730 --> 01:38:33,930
Jim, we've got another course correction for you.

1579
01:38:34,030 --> 01:38:36,100
What's up?

1580
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:38,940
Something about another course correction.

1581
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:41,970
Uh, we copy, Houston.

1582
01:38:42,070 --> 01:38:44,390
Be advised it's gonna take Freddo and l...

1583
01:38:44,490 --> 01:38:46,410
a while to power up the computer...

1584
01:38:46,510 --> 01:38:49,650
for the alignment platform if we have to fire the engine.

1585
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:51,650
Negative on that, Jim.

1586
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:54,990
We can't spare power for the computer.

1587
01:38:55,090 --> 01:38:57,160
We gotta do this blind?

1588
01:38:57,260 --> 01:39:01,330
Without the computer, what do we use for orientation?

1589
01:39:01,430 --> 01:39:04,130
We've got to be able to give these guys something.

1590
01:39:04,230 --> 01:39:06,500
Without the power, we can't give them a reading.

1591
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:08,500
l'm not talking about power, l'm talking about reference.

1592
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:11,370
No, there's no references. We have debris up there.

1593
01:39:11,470 --> 01:39:14,840
Houston, what's the story with this burn?

1594
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:16,060
We're trying to hash...

1595
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:17,850
something out down here, Aquarius.

1596
01:39:17,950 --> 01:39:19,850
Stand by.

1597
01:39:19,950 --> 01:39:25,190
Look, Houston. All we need to hold attitude is one fixed point in space.

1598
01:39:25,290 --> 01:39:29,550
ls that not correct? - Yeah. Roger that, Jim.

1599
01:39:31,430 --> 01:39:35,870
Well, Houston, we've got one.

1600
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:39,870
lf we can keep the Earth in the window, flying manually...

1601
01:39:39,970 --> 01:39:41,870
the co-ax cross hairs right on its terminator...

1602
01:39:41,970 --> 01:39:45,610
all l have to know is: how long do we need to burn the engine?

1603
01:39:45,710 --> 01:39:49,050
The shorter, the better. - Roger that, Jim.

1604
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:51,380
Can they fly it manually and still shut it down...

1605
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:54,080
on time without the computer?

1606
01:39:55,790 --> 01:39:58,220
l guess that's the best we can do.

1607
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,290
We're out of time.

1608
01:40:00,390 --> 01:40:02,290
ln order to enter the atmosphere safely...

1609
01:40:02,390 --> 01:40:05,730
the crew must aim for a corridor just two and a half degrees wide.

1610
01:40:05,830 --> 01:40:07,760
lf they're too steep, they'll incinerate...

1611
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:09,240
in the steadily thickening air.

1612
01:40:09,340 --> 01:40:11,240
lf they're too shallow, they'll ricochet...

1613
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:13,740
off the atmosphere like a rock skipping off a pond.

1614
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:16,080
The reentry corridor is, in fact, so narrow...

1615
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:18,240
that if this basketball were the Earth...

1616
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:20,250
and this softball were the moon...

1617
01:40:20,350 --> 01:40:22,750
and the two were placed 14 feet apart...

1618
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:27,050
the crew would have to hit a target no thicker than this piece of paper.

1619
01:40:27,150 --> 01:40:29,520
Okay, people, on your toes. We're doing this one blind.

1620
01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:32,190
Gene, l want you to understand we've never tried this before:

1621
01:40:32,290 --> 01:40:36,200
burn, cold soak, burn, cold soak, burn, manual control.

1622
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:38,370
Look, it will ignite, will it not?

1623
01:40:38,470 --> 01:40:40,430
l just want you to know the engine's...

1624
01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:41,870
never been tried like this.

1625
01:40:41,970 --> 01:40:44,370
That's all l'm trying to tell you.

1626
01:40:44,470 --> 01:40:46,380
l know what you're trying to do.

1627
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,710
l guarantee you, l won't hold you personally responsible.

1628
01:40:48,810 --> 01:40:52,750
lf it lights, it lights. Let Lovell do the rest.

1629
01:40:52,850 --> 01:40:54,750
Okay.

1630
01:40:54,850 --> 01:40:57,050
They're gonna burn the engines and steer it manually...

1631
01:40:57,150 --> 01:41:00,720
attempting to keep the Earth in the window.

1632
01:41:06,730 --> 01:41:09,900
Okay, this is gonna take all three of us.

1633
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,300
Freddo...

1634
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,310
you handle the pitch.

1635
01:41:14,410 --> 01:41:16,810
Put on the translation controllers, all backwards.

1636
01:41:16,910 --> 01:41:19,540
So if the Earth starts drifting down...

1637
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:23,580
you need to thrust aft, not forward.

1638
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:25,620
l'll do the same on mine with everything else.

1639
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:28,550
We're going to burn at ten percent thrust for 39 seconds.

1640
01:41:28,650 --> 01:41:31,360
Jack, you time us. - Got it.

1641
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:34,760
Give us a count of the last ten seconds up to 39.

1642
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:37,330
Let's not miss this.

1643
01:41:38,970 --> 01:41:42,470
You up to this, Freddo?

1644
01:41:42,570 --> 01:41:44,470
l'm with you.

1645
01:41:44,570 --> 01:41:48,140
Standing by for corridor control burn.

1646
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:50,980
Okay, Jim, you can fire when ready.

1647
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:53,410
You are go for the manual burn.

1648
01:41:53,510 --> 01:41:56,080
Okay, X plus button at ten seconds.

1649
01:41:56,180 --> 01:41:57,150
Mark.

1650
01:41:57,250 --> 01:41:59,920
Come on, baby. One more burn. - Nine, eight...

1651
01:42:00,020 --> 01:42:02,620
seven, six, five...

1652
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:04,960
four, three, - Ullage is go.

1653
01:42:05,060 --> 01:42:08,120
two, one, ignition.

1654
01:42:09,270 --> 01:42:11,070
She's burnin'. - Oh, yeah.

1655
01:42:11,170 --> 01:42:14,000
Master arm off. - Okay, here we go.

1656
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:18,010
Helium regulator on. - R.C.S. is go, 10% thrust.

1657
01:42:18,110 --> 01:42:21,580
Bring her around, Freddo. - l'm tryin', but it's draggin'.

1658
01:42:21,680 --> 01:42:24,610
Ten seconds. - Drop it down, Freddo.

1659
01:42:24,710 --> 01:42:26,820
We're driftin'. - No, hold what you got.

1660
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:29,020
l'll roll it. Back off. - l can't get it stable.

1661
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:31,590
She's dancin' all over the place.

1662
01:42:31,690 --> 01:42:34,090
Come to the right a little bit. - Fifteen seconds.

1663
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:36,590
She's driftin'. l'm losin' attitude.

1664
01:42:36,690 --> 01:42:39,300
Hold it right there. That's it. No, Freddo, back.

1665
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:42,000
Shit. l'm losin' it. - Bring the Earth up.

1666
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:45,500
Forward, Fred. Come on. Forward.

1667
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:48,240
Shit, l lost it. Where is it? Where is it?

1668
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:50,240
7:00. Helium regulator's closed.

1669
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:52,680
Bring it down, Freddo. Just nose it down.

1670
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:54,480
Okay, uh, okay, l got it. - Thirty seconds.

1671
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:57,320
Little farther. Ease your touch.

1672
01:42:57,420 --> 01:43:02,660
Damn it. Damn it, that's mine. That's me. Around.

1673
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:04,040
A little more. Come on, baby.

1674
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:05,790
Come on, that's it. Hold it. Damn it.

1675
01:43:05,890 --> 01:43:08,900
Back. That's it. Hold it. Steady. - ...seven, eight, nine.

1676
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,730
Shutdown.

1677
01:43:19,570 --> 01:43:22,840
Houston, we have shutdown.

1678
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:26,680
That's close enough, Jim. Good work.

1679
01:43:26,780 --> 01:43:29,750
l knew it. l knew it. How about that LEM, huh?

1680
01:43:29,850 --> 01:43:32,220
How about it?

1681
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:34,990
Guess you can keep your job. - You betcha.

1682
01:43:35,090 --> 01:43:37,660
Thirteen, stand by. We're evaluating...

1683
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:39,660
our power usage on that burn.

1684
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:43,760
Well, let's hope we don't have to do that again.

1685
01:43:57,420 --> 01:44:02,390
Gentlemen, you've given our guys enough to survive 'til reentry.

1686
01:44:02,490 --> 01:44:04,490
Well done.

1687
01:44:06,690 --> 01:44:11,030
Now we gotta get 'em in, so tell me about the power-up procedures.

1688
01:44:11,130 --> 01:44:13,600
Here's the order of what l want to do.

1689
01:44:13,700 --> 01:44:18,370
l want to power up Guidance, E.C.S., Communications...

1690
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:20,590
warm up the pyros for the parachutes...

1691
01:44:20,690 --> 01:44:22,480
and the command module thrusters.

1692
01:44:22,580 --> 01:44:24,980
The thrusters are gonna put you over budget on amps.

1693
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:27,290
They've been sitting at 200 below for...

1694
01:44:27,390 --> 01:44:29,480
four days, John. They gotta be heated.

1695
01:44:29,580 --> 01:44:31,590
Fine. Then trade off the parachutes, something.

1696
01:44:31,690 --> 01:44:34,620
Well, if the chutes don't open, what's the point?

1697
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:37,760
You're telling me what you need. l'm telling you what we have...

1698
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:39,760
l'm not making this stuff up.

1699
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:42,060
They're going to need all these systems, John.

1700
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:46,590
We do not have the power, Ken. We just don't have it.

1701
01:44:48,370 --> 01:44:49,650
Okay, l'm gonna go back...

1702
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:51,640
and reorganize the sequencing again...

1703
01:44:51,740 --> 01:44:53,840
and find more power.

1704
01:44:53,940 --> 01:44:58,040
Let's start from scratch. Clear the board.

1705
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:02,950
l don't know where the hell we're gonna find it.

1706
01:45:03,050 --> 01:45:06,520
Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell has more time in space...

1707
01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:09,490
almost 24 days already, than any other man...

1708
01:45:09,590 --> 01:45:12,200
and l asked him recently if he ever was scared.

1709
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:15,500
l've had an engine flame out a few times in an aircraft...

1710
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:19,140
and was curious as to whether it was going to light up again...

1711
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:22,480
but, uh, they seem to work out.

1712
01:45:22,580 --> 01:45:25,810
ls there an instance in an airplane emergency...

1713
01:45:25,910 --> 01:45:27,810
when you can recall fear?

1714
01:45:27,910 --> 01:45:32,320
Uh, well, l remember this one time...

1715
01:45:32,420 --> 01:45:36,060
l'm in a Banshee at night in combat conditions, so there's no...

1716
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:39,630
lt was the Shangri-la, and we were in the Sea of Japan.

1717
01:45:39,730 --> 01:45:43,630
My radar had jammed, and my homing signal was gone...

1718
01:45:43,730 --> 01:45:44,780
because somebody in Japan was...

1719
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:46,070
actually using the same frequency...

1720
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:49,470
and so it was leading me away from where l was supposed to be.

1721
01:45:49,570 --> 01:45:52,940
l'm looking down at a big, black ocean,

1722
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:55,240
so l flip on my map light.

1723
01:45:55,340 --> 01:45:57,130
Then, suddenly, zap, everything...

1724
01:45:57,230 --> 01:45:59,180
shorts out right there in my cockpit.

1725
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:03,020
All my instruments are gone. My lights are gone and l can't...

1726
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:05,740
l know l'm running out of fuel, so l'm...

1727
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:08,320
thinking about ditching into the ocean.

1728
01:46:08,420 --> 01:46:11,860
l look down there and then, in the darkness...

1729
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:15,030
there's this, uh, there's this green trail.

1730
01:46:15,130 --> 01:46:17,510
lt's like a long carpet that's just laid...

1731
01:46:17,610 --> 01:46:19,770
out right beneath me. lt was the algae.

1732
01:46:19,870 --> 01:46:21,770
lt was that phosphorescent stuff...

1733
01:46:21,870 --> 01:46:24,240
that gets churned up in the wake of a big ship.

1734
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:27,380
lt was, it was, it was just leading me home.

1735
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:29,380
lf my cockpit lights hadn't shorted out...

1736
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:32,820
there's no way l'd have ever been able to see that.

1737
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:35,390
So, uh, you, uh, you never know...

1738
01:46:35,490 --> 01:46:40,250
what, what events are going to transpire to get you home.

1739
01:46:42,730 --> 01:46:44,540
Spacecraft commander

1740
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:48,220
Jim Lovell, no stranger to emergencies.

1741
01:46:58,410 --> 01:47:02,020
How's it going, Fred? - l'm okay.

1742
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:05,920
What the hell was that?

1743
01:47:06,020 --> 01:47:08,960
Let's hope it was just the burst disk.

1744
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:11,900
Can you confirm a burst helium disk?

1745
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,230
We confirm that.

1746
01:47:13,330 --> 01:47:17,470
Houston, is that going to affect our, uh, entry angle at all?

1747
01:47:17,570 --> 01:47:20,800
Uh, negative. Your entry angle is holding at 6.24, Aquarius.

1748
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:23,510
Houston, uh...

1749
01:47:23,610 --> 01:47:26,940
we, we sure could use...

1750
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:29,310
the reentry procedure up here.

1751
01:47:29,410 --> 01:47:31,540
When can we expect that?

1752
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:36,490
Uh, that's coming real soon, Aquarius.

1753
01:47:36,590 --> 01:47:39,220
Uh, Houston, we, we--

1754
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:42,430
We just can't throw this together at the last minute.

1755
01:47:42,530 --> 01:47:45,160
So, here's what you're gonna do.

1756
01:47:45,260 --> 01:47:48,970
You're gonna get the procedure up to us, whatever it is...

1757
01:47:49,070 --> 01:47:51,060
and we're gonna go over it...

1758
01:47:51,160 --> 01:47:53,710
step by step, so there's no foul-ups.

1759
01:47:53,810 --> 01:47:57,340
l don't have to tell you we're all a little tired up here.

1760
01:47:57,440 --> 01:48:00,150
The world's getting awfully big in the window.

1761
01:48:00,250 --> 01:48:02,720
Jim, this is Deke. - lt's Deke.

1762
01:48:02,820 --> 01:48:05,050
They don't know how to do it.

1763
01:48:05,150 --> 01:48:07,070
Maybe Jack's right.

1764
01:48:07,170 --> 01:48:10,820
Hello there, Deke. What's the story?

1765
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:12,930
We're gonna get that power-up procedure to you.

1766
01:48:13,030 --> 01:48:14,960
We're gonna get it as soon as we possibly can.

1767
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:19,300
Ken Mattingly's in the simulator right now.

1768
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:21,770
Ken's working on it?

1769
01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:26,210
Look...

1770
01:48:26,310 --> 01:48:28,210
l know this sequence works, John.

1771
01:48:28,310 --> 01:48:29,330
The sequence looks good.

1772
01:48:29,430 --> 01:48:31,110
We're just over budget on the amperage.

1773
01:48:31,210 --> 01:48:33,580
By how much? - Three or four amps.

1774
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:35,820
Goddamn it, John. ls it three or four?

1775
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:37,750
Four. - Four.

1776
01:48:37,850 --> 01:48:41,580
Four more amps.

1777
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:52,940
We know they have some power left...

1778
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:54,200
in the LEM batteries, right?

1779
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:56,570
Yeah.

1780
01:48:56,670 --> 01:48:58,850
We have an umbilical that provides power...

1781
01:48:58,950 --> 01:49:00,710
from the command module to the LEM.

1782
01:49:00,810 --> 01:49:03,180
lt's backup for the LEM power supply.

1783
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:04,280
l'm listening.

1784
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:06,580
So... reverse it.

1785
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:08,920
Reverse the flow and see if we can draw these four amps...

1786
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:10,920
from the LEM batteries before we cut it lose.

1787
01:49:11,020 --> 01:49:12,560
Why can't we do that?

1788
01:49:12,660 --> 01:49:15,260
We don't have a procedure for that?

1789
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:17,400
You're gonna lose a lot in the transfer, Ken.

1790
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:21,400
Yeah, yeah, but all we're talking about here is four amps.

1791
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:24,600
l want whatever you guys got on these power procedures.

1792
01:49:24,700 --> 01:49:28,110
Gene, they're already-- - l don't want the whole bible,

1793
01:49:28,210 --> 01:49:30,440
We've got to get something up to these guys.

1794
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:32,950
l'll call the simulator and get an estimate.

1795
01:49:33,050 --> 01:49:38,310
l don't want another estimate. l want the procedures... now.

1796
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:50,590
l.M.U. is up.

1797
01:49:52,070 --> 01:49:54,800
How am l reading? - Fine, so far.

1798
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:55,380
Say again.

1799
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:57,270
You're under the limit. Keep going.

1800
01:49:57,370 --> 01:50:00,600
Okay. Floodlights to fixed.

1801
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:06,280
Okay, l'm bringing up the guidance.

1802
01:50:06,380 --> 01:50:08,940
Here we go.

1803
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:13,090
C.M.C. attitude l.M.U.

1804
01:50:13,190 --> 01:50:16,090
C.M.C. source.

1805
01:50:16,190 --> 01:50:20,560
C.M.C. mode, auto, and we're on the computer.

1806
01:50:27,370 --> 01:50:29,940
Ken?

1807
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:33,180
Go ahead. - ls your computer on now?

1808
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:37,610
Up and running. How do we look?

1809
01:50:41,290 --> 01:50:43,480
John?

1810
01:50:46,830 --> 01:50:49,060
l think we got it, buddy.

1811
01:50:59,380 --> 01:51:01,780
Arthur, my notes are clear on that last sequence, right?

1812
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:03,280
Yeah.

1813
01:51:03,380 --> 01:51:08,400
Excuse me, gentlemen. - l was getting a little blurry there.

1814
01:51:09,390 --> 01:51:11,790
Here's Ken. Here's John.

1815
01:51:11,890 --> 01:51:13,960
lt's good to see you, Ken.

1816
01:51:14,060 --> 01:51:16,130
This is the sequence.

1817
01:51:16,230 --> 01:51:20,640
Was it tried on the hardware yet? - We didn't have time.

1818
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:23,470
Aquarius, Houston. Do you read?

1819
01:51:23,570 --> 01:51:27,640
Yeah, we read you, Ken.

1820
01:51:27,740 --> 01:51:30,580
Are the flowers blooming in Houston?

1821
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:35,580
Uh, that's a negative, Jim. l don't have the measles.

1822
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:41,490
Jim, is Jack in there with you?

1823
01:51:41,590 --> 01:51:45,000
Uh, yeah, stand by one. We gotta get him on comm.

1824
01:51:45,100 --> 01:51:48,000
Put those on the table. - Oh, damn it. Thanks, Jackie.

1825
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:50,340
l think it would really help if you could...

1826
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:55,010
just distract her when the heavy predictions come in.

1827
01:51:55,110 --> 01:51:57,840
Yeah, yeah. We'll give it a shot. - Thanks.

1828
01:51:57,940 --> 01:51:59,850
Blanch.

1829
01:51:59,950 --> 01:52:01,450
Blanch, these nice, young men...

1830
01:52:01,550 --> 01:52:03,450
are gonna watch the television with you.

1831
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:05,790
This is Neil Armstrong, and this is Buzz Aldrin.

1832
01:52:05,890 --> 01:52:07,290
Nice to meet you.

1833
01:52:07,390 --> 01:52:08,390
Hi.

1834
01:52:08,490 --> 01:52:12,630
Are you boys in the space program too?

1835
01:52:12,730 --> 01:52:16,860
Okay, Jack, give me a read-back on that last procedure.

1836
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:21,800
Uh, stand by, Ken.

1837
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:26,640
Ken, l'm having trouble reading my own writing.

1838
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:30,820
l guess l was a little more tired than l thought.

1839
01:52:35,250 --> 01:52:39,250
Uh, don't worry, Jack. l'll talk you through it.

1840
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:44,160
Okay, find the main bus breakers on panel 11.

1841
01:52:45,060 --> 01:52:46,960
Yeah, main bus breakers.

1842
01:52:47,060 --> 01:52:49,270
Got it. - Close main bus B.

1843
01:52:56,770 --> 01:53:00,950
Ken, there's an awful lot of condensation on these panels.

1844
01:53:01,050 --> 01:53:04,790
What's the word on these things shorting out?

1845
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:11,960
Uh, we'll just take that one at a time, Jack.

1846
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:18,150
lt's like tryin' to drive a toaster through a car wash.

1847
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:26,910
Main bus B is closed.

1848
01:53:27,010 --> 01:53:27,790
Okay, Thirteen,

1849
01:53:27,890 --> 01:53:29,780
we're coming up on entry interface.

1850
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:33,610
Flight, we're still shallowing up a bit in the reentry corridor.

1851
01:53:33,710 --> 01:53:35,850
lt's almost like they're underweight.

1852
01:53:35,950 --> 01:53:38,690
Now how could they be underweight?

1853
01:53:38,790 --> 01:53:40,950
We didn't land on the moon.

1854
01:53:41,050 --> 01:53:43,560
Rocks? - That's affirm.

1855
01:53:43,660 --> 01:53:45,560
Uh, one more thing, Jim.

1856
01:53:45,660 --> 01:53:47,020
While Jack's working on the power-up,

1857
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:48,100
we'd like you and Freddo...

1858
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:50,830
to transfer some ballast over to the command module.

1859
01:53:50,930 --> 01:53:52,870
Uh, say again, Houston. Ballast?

1860
01:53:52,970 --> 01:53:56,210
Um, that's affirm. We got to get the weight right.

1861
01:53:56,310 --> 01:53:58,070
We were expecting you to be toting...

1862
01:53:58,170 --> 01:53:59,980
a couple hundred pounds of moon rocks.

1863
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:01,980
Right, Houston.

1864
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:04,210
Now, Jack. - Yeah, go ahead, Ken.

1865
01:54:04,310 --> 01:54:07,380
Okay, now, uh, panel five.

1866
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:12,360
Circuit breaker caution and warning main B closed.

1867
01:54:12,460 --> 01:54:14,930
Main B closed.

1868
01:54:15,030 --> 01:54:17,600
Master alarm off.

1869
01:54:17,700 --> 01:54:19,560
Okay, Jack, uh, on panel seven,

1870
01:54:19,660 --> 01:54:21,770
B-MAG number two, power to warm-up.

1871
01:54:21,870 --> 01:54:24,440
B-MAG number two, power to warm-up done.

1872
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:27,510
Sequential logic one and two on.

1873
01:54:27,610 --> 01:54:30,210
Sequential logic... two on.

1874
01:54:30,310 --> 01:54:33,750
C.M.R.C.S. pressure on.

1875
01:54:33,850 --> 01:54:35,780
C.M.R.C.S. pressurization.

1876
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:37,720
As her husband prepares to jettison...

1877
01:54:37,820 --> 01:54:39,150
his lunar module lifeboat...

1878
01:54:39,250 --> 01:54:42,090
Marilyn Lovell waits with her children, her neighbors...

1879
01:54:42,190 --> 01:54:44,730
and, we are told, Apollo 11 astronauts

1880
01:54:44,830 --> 01:54:46,890
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.

1881
01:54:46,990 --> 01:54:49,630
Only the Lovell's eldest son, Jay, is absent...

1882
01:54:49,730 --> 01:54:51,630
as he holds vigil with his classmates...

1883
01:54:51,730 --> 01:54:55,340
at the St. Johns Military Academy in Wisconsin.

1884
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:58,670
ABC News science editor Jules Bergman.

1885
01:54:58,770 --> 01:55:00,290
With a crippled command module, and...

1886
01:55:00,390 --> 01:55:01,940
surviving by using the LEM's systems...

1887
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:03,950
there can be no easy maneuver.

1888
01:55:04,050 --> 01:55:07,180
Their LEM lifeboat is doing things and working longer...

1889
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:09,190
than it was ever intended to.

1890
01:55:09,290 --> 01:55:11,690
lt's a race against time until splashdown.

1891
01:55:11,790 --> 01:55:14,090
Okay, Jack, we're ready to see if the computer will accept...

1892
01:55:14,190 --> 01:55:16,030
uplink of the reentry data now. - Okay, the l.M.U. is up.

1893
01:55:16,130 --> 01:55:19,500
uplink of the reentry data now. - Okay, the l.M.U. is up.

1894
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:23,840
We got our eight-balls back. - Copy that.

1895
01:55:23,940 --> 01:55:27,380
Okay, Ken, uh, uplink telemetry, command module to accept, right?

1896
01:55:27,480 --> 01:55:32,020
That's affirm. Go ahead and try it.

1897
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:34,140
Come on.

1898
01:55:50,170 --> 01:55:52,170
Uplink completed.

1899
01:55:57,550 --> 01:55:59,550
Yeah. That's more like it. - We're back in business.

1900
01:55:59,650 --> 01:56:01,080
Yeah. - Okay, let's go.

1901
01:56:01,180 --> 01:56:03,900
Look at your amps. How we doin'?

1902
01:56:06,390 --> 01:56:08,290
We got her back up, Ken.

1903
01:56:08,390 --> 01:56:10,590
Boy, l wish you were here to see it.

1904
01:56:10,690 --> 01:56:14,130
l'll bet you do.

1905
01:56:14,230 --> 01:56:17,690
Way to go, Jack.

1906
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:24,540
Flight, this is RETRO. - Go, RETRO.

1907
01:56:24,640 --> 01:56:27,110
Flight, we are looking at a typhoon warning...

1908
01:56:27,210 --> 01:56:29,280
on the edge of the prime recovery zone.

1909
01:56:29,380 --> 01:56:30,380
Say again, RETRO.

1910
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:32,360
We are looking at a typhoon warning...

1911
01:56:32,460 --> 01:56:34,380
on the edge of the prime recovery area.

1912
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:37,160
This is just a warning. lt could miss them.

1913
01:56:37,260 --> 01:56:39,790
Only if their luck changes.

1914
01:56:39,890 --> 01:56:42,390
Jim, we're ready for S.M. jettison.

1915
01:56:42,490 --> 01:56:46,000
All right, Jack, on three.

1916
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:49,270
One... two...

1917
01:56:49,370 --> 01:56:52,470
upward thrust. - We're loose.

1918
01:56:52,570 --> 01:56:54,570
Reverse thrust.

1919
01:56:54,670 --> 01:56:56,740
We have service module jettison.

1920
01:56:56,840 --> 01:56:59,750
Okay, Houston, service module is free.

1921
01:56:59,850 --> 01:57:01,920
We're gonna take a look at what we have here.

1922
01:57:02,020 --> 01:57:04,040
Copy that.

1923
01:57:07,790 --> 01:57:10,090
There it is. l see it.

1924
01:57:10,190 --> 01:57:13,030
Oh.

1925
01:57:13,130 --> 01:57:15,240
Houston, we're getting our first look...

1926
01:57:15,340 --> 01:57:16,700
at the service module now.

1927
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:20,540
One whole side of the spacecraft is missing.

1928
01:57:20,640 --> 01:57:24,540
Right by the high gain antennae a whole panel is blown out...

1929
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:28,710
right up, right up to our heat shield.

1930
01:57:28,810 --> 01:57:31,380
Uh, copy that, Aquarius.

1931
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:33,370
lt looked like it got...

1932
01:57:33,470 --> 01:57:36,700
the engine bell too. Can you see that?

1933
01:57:38,390 --> 01:57:41,050
Oh, man, that's incredible.

1934
01:57:44,060 --> 01:57:45,700
The heat shield.

1935
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:48,590
The heat will build up to as much...

1936
01:57:48,690 --> 01:57:51,570
as 3,000 or 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

1937
01:57:51,670 --> 01:57:52,590
On a lunar reentry flight,

1938
01:57:52,690 --> 01:57:53,900
the heat approaches 4,000 degrees.

1939
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,670
So, uh, Blanch?

1940
01:57:55,770 --> 01:57:59,740
Blanch? Did Jim make Eagle Scout or not?

1941
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:01,880
Yes, he did. - He did.

1942
01:58:01,980 --> 01:58:04,180
lf the heat shield is even slightly cracked...

1943
01:58:04,280 --> 01:58:06,850
the extreme cold could have split it wide open.

1944
01:58:06,950 --> 01:58:10,190
Worst of all, if the pyrotechnics that control the parachutes...

1945
01:58:10,290 --> 01:58:13,030
have been damaged, the chutes may not open at all...

1946
01:58:13,130 --> 01:58:15,120
causing the spacecraft to hit the water...

1947
01:58:15,220 --> 01:58:16,930
not at a gentle 20 miles per hour...

1948
01:58:17,030 --> 01:58:19,430
but at a suicidal 300.

1949
01:58:19,530 --> 01:58:21,440
Perhaps never in human history...

1950
01:58:21,540 --> 01:58:24,670
has the entire world been united by such a global drama.

1951
01:58:24,770 --> 01:58:27,880
ln New York City, thousands of people have gathered...

1952
01:58:27,980 --> 01:58:30,780
to watch updates of the mission in Times Square.

1953
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:33,580
Many countries offered help, and the State Department said...

1954
01:58:33,680 --> 01:58:35,880
it would ask for it if it were needed.

1955
01:58:35,980 --> 01:58:37,620
The House and Senate passed resolutions...

1956
01:58:37,720 --> 01:58:38,990
calling on the American people...

1957
01:58:39,090 --> 01:58:41,420
to pray tonight for the astronauts.

1958
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:44,790
ln Rome, Pope Paul led 50,000 people...

1959
01:58:44,890 --> 01:58:47,630
in prayers for the safe return of the astronauts.

1960
01:58:47,730 --> 01:58:51,220
ln Jerusalem, prayers at the Wailing Wall.

1961
01:58:55,940 --> 01:59:00,360
Uh, it's about time to bail out of this ship, Freddo.

1962
01:59:03,180 --> 01:59:05,180
Freddo?

1963
01:59:06,280 --> 01:59:08,490
You okay?

1964
01:59:08,590 --> 01:59:11,850
l'm, uh-- l'm freezing.

1965
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:16,560
Can you hold out just a little longer?

1966
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:19,870
Long as l have to. - Aw, come on.

1967
01:59:19,970 --> 01:59:24,390
lt won't be long. Just a little while longer, Freddo.

1968
01:59:25,940 --> 01:59:28,510
Just a little while longer. We're gonna...

1969
01:59:28,610 --> 01:59:30,810
hit that water in the South Pacific.

1970
01:59:30,910 --> 01:59:34,280
Open up that hatch.

1971
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:38,880
lt's 80 degrees out there. - Eighty degrees.

1972
01:59:40,250 --> 01:59:44,690
You are a mess. - Y-Yeah.

1973
01:59:44,790 --> 01:59:48,230
Odyssey, Houston. Uh, how we doin', guys?

1974
01:59:48,330 --> 01:59:50,600
We're closing in on lunar module jettison.

1975
01:59:50,700 --> 01:59:52,700
As you know, that is time critical.

1976
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:55,570
We should be making our move into the command module.

1977
01:59:55,670 --> 01:59:57,570
Let's get that hatch buttoned up,

1978
01:59:57,670 --> 02:00:01,340
and, when you get a chance, let us know how you're doing.

1979
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:02,850
Roger that.

1980
02:00:02,950 --> 02:00:07,210
Let me give you a hand there, Freddo.

1981
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:45,320
We're coming up on LEM jettison.

1982
02:00:45,420 --> 02:00:47,860
ls everyone strapped in, Ken? We're getting real close.

1983
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:50,360
Uh, copy that, Flight. Uh, 13, Houston.

1984
02:00:50,460 --> 02:00:52,670
Uh, we're coming up on LEM jettison.

1985
02:00:52,770 --> 02:00:54,900
Stand by.

1986
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,700
Have you got everybody in the Odyssey?

1987
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:01,080
Yeah, Ken, l'm gonna check those pyro batteries one more time here.

1988
02:01:01,180 --> 02:01:03,710
Okay, the pyro batts look good.

1989
02:01:03,810 --> 02:01:08,660
l don't think we're gonna have to tie the other batteries.

1990
02:01:19,330 --> 02:01:21,760
Sorry, Jack, this is an old habit.

1991
02:01:21,860 --> 02:01:26,620
l'm kind of used to the pilot's seat. She's yours to fly.

1992
02:01:29,670 --> 02:01:31,420
Okay, Odyssey, l want to...

1993
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:34,080
double check some reentry procedures...

1994
02:01:34,180 --> 02:01:38,780
right after we jettison the LEM, which is coming up in 30 seconds.

1995
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:41,050
What is that?

1996
02:01:41,150 --> 02:01:43,450
Oh, l was getting a little punchy...

1997
02:01:43,550 --> 02:01:45,790
and l didn't want to cut the LEM loose...

1998
02:01:45,890 --> 02:01:47,290
with you guys still in it.

1999
02:01:47,390 --> 02:01:49,550
That's good thinking.

2000
02:01:52,100 --> 02:01:54,100
Stand by, Houston.

2001
02:01:56,600 --> 02:01:59,400
We have lunar module jettison.

2002
02:02:06,350 --> 02:02:09,210
She sure was a good ship.

2003
02:02:10,580 --> 02:02:14,680
Farewell, Aquarius, and we thank you.

2004
02:02:20,490 --> 02:02:24,230
Mary?

2005
02:02:24,330 --> 02:02:27,860
lt's almost time, honey.

2006
02:02:29,870 --> 02:02:31,900
Flight 9-6-6-4-0-6.

2007
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:54,210
Let me put it this way.

2008
02:02:54,310 --> 02:02:56,650
The trajectory may be off. Their thrusters may be frozen.

2009
02:02:56,750 --> 02:02:58,820
Their guidance system might be malfunctioning.

2010
02:02:58,920 --> 02:03:00,820
Their heat shield could be cracked.

2011
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:04,150
And their parachutes might be three blocks of ice.

2012
02:03:04,250 --> 02:03:06,260
Clearly, we have some obstacles to overcome.

2013
02:03:06,360 --> 02:03:08,510
Yeah, okay, but now l'm asking you,

2014
02:03:08,610 --> 02:03:09,690
when will we know?

2015
02:03:09,790 --> 02:03:11,860
Well, blackout lasts for three minutes.

2016
02:03:11,960 --> 02:03:16,600
lf they're not back in four, we'll know.

2017
02:03:16,700 --> 02:03:21,170
Velocity now reading 34,802 feet per second.

2018
02:03:21,270 --> 02:03:23,840
Range to go 2,625 nautical miles. - Copy that.

2019
02:03:23,940 --> 02:03:27,050
Okay, Ken, we are aligned for reentry.

2020
02:03:27,150 --> 02:03:29,550
Jim, we're going to need that computer reentry program.

2021
02:03:29,650 --> 02:03:32,340
Fred, how are the batteries looking?

2022
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:34,220
Okay. Batt A looks good.

2023
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:36,390
Reentry interface in one minute...

2024
02:03:36,490 --> 02:03:39,380
Batt B, no volts, the amps are okay.

2025
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:40,660
and 30 seconds.

2026
02:03:40,760 --> 02:03:43,030
Batt C...

2027
02:03:43,130 --> 02:03:46,530
shit, no volts, only two amps.

2028
02:03:46,630 --> 02:03:49,200
lt may die before the main chutes open.

2029
02:03:49,300 --> 02:03:52,410
Roger. Let's tie all the batteries onto main A and main B.

2030
02:03:52,510 --> 02:03:56,040
Flight, they're still shallowing a bit up there. Do you want to tell 'em?

2031
02:03:56,140 --> 02:03:58,730
ls there anything we can do about it?

2032
02:03:58,830 --> 02:03:59,910
Not now, Flight.

2033
02:04:00,010 --> 02:04:01,840
Then they don't need to know, do they?

2034
02:04:01,940 --> 02:04:02,380
Copy that.

2035
02:04:02,480 --> 02:04:03,640
RETRO says the typhoon is still...

2036
02:04:03,740 --> 02:04:04,890
a presence in the splashdown area?

2037
02:04:04,990 --> 02:04:09,160
Yeah. - We got the parachute situation...

2038
02:04:09,260 --> 02:04:11,590
the heat shield, the angle of trajectory and the typhoon.

2039
02:04:11,690 --> 02:04:13,930
There's so many variables, l'm a little at a loss--...

2040
02:04:14,030 --> 02:04:15,600
l know what the problems are.

2041
02:04:15,700 --> 02:04:18,070
This could be the worst disaster NASA's ever experienced.

2042
02:04:18,170 --> 02:04:23,710
With all due respect, sir, l believe this is going to be our finest hour.

2043
02:04:23,810 --> 02:04:26,540
Okay.

2044
02:04:35,590 --> 02:04:39,730
Expect entry interface in 45 seconds.

2045
02:04:39,830 --> 02:04:41,990
And on my mark, your velocity...

2046
02:04:42,090 --> 02:04:46,800
will be 35,245 feet per second.

2047
02:04:46,900 --> 02:04:50,360
Mark 35 seconds to entry interface.

2048
02:04:52,670 --> 02:04:56,640
Gentlemen...

2049
02:04:56,740 --> 02:04:59,890
it's been a privilege flying with you.

2050
02:05:40,490 --> 02:05:43,230
Flight, we have loss of radio contact.

2051
02:05:43,330 --> 02:05:44,630
Roger that.

2052
02:05:44,730 --> 02:05:48,130
Expect to regain signal in three minutes.

2053
02:05:50,440 --> 02:05:53,330
lt all depends on the heat shield.

2054
02:06:25,070 --> 02:06:27,980
Back to the lwo Jima and our live cameras there.

2055
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:32,350
The Navy recovery and rescue helicopters already airborne...

2056
02:06:32,450 --> 02:06:34,950
circling, waiting for first radar contact.

2057
02:06:35,050 --> 02:06:36,160
Coming up now on three...

2058
02:06:36,260 --> 02:06:38,050
minutes until time of drogue deployment.

2059
02:06:38,150 --> 02:06:40,060
Bill, what time you got?

2060
02:06:40,160 --> 02:06:44,060
Standing by for any reports of acquisition.

2061
02:06:47,630 --> 02:06:51,570
One minute and 30 seconds to end of blackout.

2062
02:06:56,670 --> 02:06:58,580
No reentering ship has ever taken longer...

2063
02:06:58,680 --> 02:07:02,350
than three minutes to emerge from blackout.

2064
02:07:02,450 --> 02:07:05,320
This is the critical moment. Will the heat shield hold?

2065
02:07:05,420 --> 02:07:09,320
Will the command module survive the intense heat of reentry?

2066
02:07:09,420 --> 02:07:12,320
lf it doesn't, there'll only be silence.

2067
02:07:12,420 --> 02:07:15,830
Mommy, you're squishing me. - Oops, sorry, sweetie.

2068
02:07:15,930 --> 02:07:17,950
lt's okay.

2069
02:07:33,280 --> 02:07:35,850
Okay, Flight, that's three minutes.

2070
02:07:35,950 --> 02:07:39,950
We are standing by for acquisition. - Copy that.

2071
02:07:40,860 --> 02:07:43,860
Odyssey, Houston. Do you read me?

2072
02:07:43,960 --> 02:07:45,930
Odyssey, this is Houston. Do you read?

2073
02:07:46,030 --> 02:07:48,900
Expected time of reacquisition...

2074
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,420
the time when the astronauts were...

2075
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:51,900
expected to come out of blackout...

2076
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:56,610
has come and gone.

2077
02:07:56,710 --> 02:08:00,280
About all any of us can do now is just listen and hope.

2078
02:08:00,380 --> 02:08:03,880
We're about to learn whether or not that heat shield...

2079
02:08:03,980 --> 02:08:06,320
which was damaged by the explosion three days ago...

2080
02:08:06,420 --> 02:08:09,480
has withstood the inferno of reentry.

2081
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:16,050
Odyssey, this is Houston. Do you read me?

2082
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:21,100
Odyssey, Houston. Do you read?

2083
02:08:21,200 --> 02:08:25,170
Three minutes, 30 seconds. Standing by.

2084
02:08:25,270 --> 02:08:29,210
Odyssey, Houston. Do you read?

2085
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:40,080
Odyssey, this is Houston. Do you read me?

2086
02:08:43,020 --> 02:08:45,890
That's four minutes. Standing by.

2087
02:09:07,420 --> 02:09:10,510
Odyssey, uh, Houston. Do you read?

2088
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:21,130
Hello, Houston, this is Odyssey.

2089
02:09:21,230 --> 02:09:24,600
lt's good to see you again.

2090
02:09:46,460 --> 02:09:49,360
Odyssey, Houston. Welcome home.

2091
02:09:49,460 --> 02:09:51,700
We're glad to see you.

2092
02:09:51,800 --> 02:09:54,860
Good job, Ken. Good job. - Thank you.

2093
02:10:38,350 --> 02:10:41,650
They made it. They made it.

2094
02:10:52,330 --> 02:10:56,530
Yeah. - Lunney.

2095
02:11:22,660 --> 02:11:26,570
Houston, we're at stable one. The ship is secure.

2096
02:11:26,670 --> 02:11:29,370
This is Apollo 13 signing off.

2097
02:11:29,470 --> 02:11:32,630
Good job.

2098
02:12:23,030 --> 02:12:24,660
Our mission was called a successful failure...

2099
02:12:24,760 --> 02:12:28,430
in that we returned safely, but never made it to the moon.

2100
02:12:28,530 --> 02:12:31,900
ln the following months, it was determined...

2101
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,910
that a damaged coil built inside the oxygen tank...

2102
02:12:35,010 --> 02:12:37,300
sparked during our cryo stir and caused...

2103
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:39,580
the explosion that crippled the Odyssey.

2104
02:12:39,680 --> 02:12:42,080
lt was a minor defect that occurred two years...

2105
02:12:42,180 --> 02:12:45,250
before l was named the flight's commander.

2106
02:12:45,350 --> 02:12:48,920
Fred Haise was going back to the moon on Apollo 18...

2107
02:12:49,020 --> 02:12:51,260
but his mission was canceled because of budget cuts.

2108
02:12:51,360 --> 02:12:53,290
He never flew in space again.

2109
02:12:53,390 --> 02:12:56,600
Nor did Jack Swigert, who left the astronaut corps...

2110
02:12:56,700 --> 02:12:59,770
and was elected to Congress from the state of Colorado.

2111
02:12:59,870 --> 02:13:03,740
But he died of cancer before he was able to take office.

2112
02:13:03,840 --> 02:13:05,720
Ken Mattingly orbited the moon...

2113
02:13:05,820 --> 02:13:08,040
as command module pilot of Apollo 16...

2114
02:13:08,140 --> 02:13:11,910
and flew the space shuttle, having never gotten the measles.

2115
02:13:12,020 --> 02:13:14,460
Gene Kranz retired as Director...

2116
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:17,450
of Flight Operations just not long ago.

2117
02:13:17,550 --> 02:13:18,800
And many other members of Mission

2118
02:13:18,900 --> 02:13:20,390
Control have gone on to other things...

2119
02:13:20,490 --> 02:13:22,620
but some are still there.

2120
02:13:23,660 --> 02:13:25,230
And as for me...

2121
02:13:25,330 --> 02:13:30,230
the seven extraordinary days of Apollo 13 were my last in space.

2122
02:13:30,330 --> 02:13:33,310
l watched other men walk on the moon...

2123
02:13:33,410 --> 02:13:34,910
and return safely...

2124
02:13:35,010 --> 02:13:37,890
all from the confines of Mission Control...

2125
02:13:37,990 --> 02:13:39,640
and our house in Houston.

2126
02:13:39,740 --> 02:13:42,910
l sometimes catch myself looking up at the moon...

2127
02:13:43,010 --> 02:13:46,420
remembering the changes of fortune in our long voyage...

2128
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:49,340
thinking of the thousands of people who...

2129
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:51,920
worked to bring the three of us home.

2130
02:13:52,020 --> 02:13:55,090
l look up at the moon and wonder...

2131
02:13:55,190 --> 02:13:57,760
when will we be going back...

2132
02:13:57,870 --> 02:14:01,530
and who will that be?
