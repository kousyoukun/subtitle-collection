-嗯  沒問題  -我說真的
- Yeah, you can count on it. - I'm serious!

133
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,610
我知道
I know, I know.

134
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,140
凱撒的東西給凱撒吧  給
Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's. There you go.

135
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,610
斯塔克先生  等等  斯塔克先生
Mr Stark! Excuse me, Mr Stark!

136
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,810
克莉絲汀·艾凡哈特  《名利場》雜志的
Christine Everhart, Vanity Fair magazine.

137
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,060
可以問您幾個問題嗎
Can I ask you a couple of questions?

138
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,560
-她很美  -是嗎
- She's cute. - She's all right?

139
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,890
-當然  問吧  -行嗎
- Yeah. Okay, go. - It's okay?

140
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,850
您被稱為當代達·芬奇
You've been called the da Vinci of our time.

141
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,760
您對此有何看法
What do you say to that?

142
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,690
荒唐  我又不會畫畫
Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.

143
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,410
那您怎么看待你的其他外號
And what do you say to your other nickname?

144
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,670
"死亡商人"
"The Merchant of Death"?

145
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,760
這不算壞
That's not bad.

146
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,910
我猜猜  伯克利畢業的
Let me guess. Berkeley?

147
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,320
其實是布朗大學
Brown, actually.

148
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,700
布朗大學小姐
Well, Ms Brown,

149
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,300
這是個不完美的世界  但我們只有這個世界
it's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we've got.

150
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,040
我向你保證
I guarantee you,

151
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,020
如果哪天再不需要武器來維護和平了
the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace,

152
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,460
我會開始為嬰兒醫院制造建材的
I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.

153
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,540
這段話常練嗎
Rehearse that much?

154
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,290
每晚睡覺前都會對著鏡子說
Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime.

155
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,690
-看出來了  -我想讓你親眼見識一下
- I can see that. - I'd like to show you first-hand.

156
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,080
我只想要個嚴肅的答案
All I want is a serious answer.

157
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,280
好吧  說嚴肅的  我老爸有個理論
Okay, here's serious. My old man had a philosophy,

158
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,880
"和平就是比對方的棍子大"
"Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy."

159
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,250
賣棍子的人說這話真討巧
That's a great line coming from the guy selling the sticks.

160
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,540
我父親幫忙打敗了納粹
My father helped defeat the Nazis.

161
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,970
他還參與了曼哈頓計劃[原子彈]
He worked on the Manhattan Project.

162
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,760
很多人  包括你布朗大學的教授們
A lot of people, including your professors at Brown,

163
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,100
都會認為這叫英雄
would call that being a hero.

164
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,310
也會有很多人稱之為戰爭牟利
And a lot of people would also call that war profiteering.

165
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,360
告訴我  你打算報道我們靠推動醫療科技
Tell me, do you plan to report on the millions we've saved

166
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,970
和改善農業技術
by advancing medical technology

167
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,880
而讓千百萬人延續壽命  免受饑荒的事嗎
or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops?

168
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,610
所有那些突破
All those breakthroughs,

169
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,550
都是由軍工提供的資金  親愛的
military funding, honey.

170
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,690
你這輩子失眠過嗎
You ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life?

171
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,650
我愿意跟你失眠幾小時
I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.

172
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,370
早上好  現在是早7點
Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m.

173
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,380
馬里布氣溫為22度  少云
The weather in Malibu is 72 degrees with scattered clouds.

174
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,740
沖浪條件不錯  海浪到腰和肩之間
The surf conditions are fair with waist-to-shoulder high lines.

加州  馬里布

177
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,370
托尼
Tony?

178
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,340
托尼
Hey, Tony?

179
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,450
你無權進入這個區域
You are not authorised to access this area.

180
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,040
-天吶  -那是賈維斯  他是房子的管家
- Jesus. - That's Jarvis. He runs the house.

181
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,360
這是你的衣服  干洗熨燙過了
I've got your clothes here. They've been dry-cleaned and pressed,

182
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,160
外面有輛車在等著你
and there's a car waiting for you outside

183
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,470
會帶你去任何你指定的地方
that will take you anywhere you'd like to go.

184
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,780
-你一定是著名的派珀·波茨  -是的
- You must be the famous Pepper Potts. - Indeed I am.

185
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,040
都這么多年了
After all these years,

186
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,330
托尼還讓你替他拿干洗衣物
Tony still has you picking up the dry-cleaning.

187
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,400
我做任何斯塔克先生要我做的事
I do anything and everything that Mr Stark requires,

188
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,270
偶爾也包括倒垃圾
including, occasionally, taking out the trash.

189
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,480
沒有別的事了吧
Will that be all?

190
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,800
擴展視圖
Give me an exploded view.

191
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,150
3號氣缸的氣壓似乎過低了
The compression in cylinder three appears to be low.

192
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:53,820
記錄一下
Log that.

193
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,940
-我這就再試一次  -請別把我的音樂關小
- I'm gonna try again, right now. - Please don't turn down my music.

194
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,930
我再通知你
I'll keep you posted.

195
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,820
你現在應該在去往地球另一邊的路上了
You are supposed to be halfway around the world right now.

196
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,300
-她接受得如何  -非常好
- How'd she take it? - Like a champ.

197
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,660
你為什么急著趕我走
Why are you trying to hustle me out of here?

198
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,590
你的航班應該是一個半小時前離開的
Your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago.

199
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,020
有意思  我以為考慮到那是我的飛機
That's funny, I thought with it being my plane and all,

200
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,420
它會等我到了再出發呢
that it would just wait for me to get there.

201
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,070
托尼  我有幾件事要跟你商量
Tony, I need to speak to you about a couple things

202
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,020
然后我就要送你出門了
before I get you out of the door.

203
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,580
如果你還沒到  飛機就飛了
Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole purpose

204
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,560
那有自己的飛機
of having your own plane

205
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,060
不就沒意義了嗎
if it departs before you arrive?

206
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,310
拉里來電
Larry called.

207
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,390
他為杰克遜·波洛克畫找到了新買家
He's got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.

208
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,250
你還想不想要它
Do you want it? Yes or no.

209
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,540
那是他的"春"期代表作嗎
Is it a good representation of his spring period?

210
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,590
不是  斯普林斯是他曾生活工作過的
No. The Springs was actually the neighbourhood in East Hampton

211
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,950
一個東漢普頓社區
where he lived and worked,

212
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,600
-并不是春天的"春"  -是嗎
- not "spring" like the season. - So?

213
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:37,310
我覺得還可以  而且定價過高了
I think it's a fair example. I think it's incredibly overpriced.

214
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,610
我要  買  存起來
I need it. Buy it. Store it.

215
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,890
好  麻省理工學院畢業典禮講話
Okay. The MIT commencement speech...

216
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,050
6月的事  拜托
Is in June. Please,

217
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,250
別拿還沒影的事來嘮叨我
don't harangue me about stuff that's way, way, down...

218
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,240
他們在嘮叨我  我就答應了
They're haranguing me, so I'm gonna say yes.

219
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,010
反彈或吸收
Deflect it and absorb it.

220
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,570
-別傳遞給我  -你上機前
- Don't transmit it back to me. - I need you to sign this

221
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,920
-我需要你給這個簽字  -你干嗎非要趕我走
- before you get on the plane. - What are you trying to get rid of me for?

222
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,250
你有安排嗎
What, you got plans?

223
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,940
-事實上  真有  -我不喜歡你有安排
- As a matter of fact, I do. - I don't like it when you have plans.

224
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,970
我生日這天是可以有安排的
I'm allowed to have plans on my birthday.

225
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,680
-今天是你生日嗎  -嗯
- It's your birthday? - Yes.

226
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,130
我知道的  這就到了嗎
I knew that. Already?

227
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,800
是的  多奇怪啊  跟去年是同一天
Yeah. Isn't that strange? It's the same day as last year.

228
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,210
-拿我的錢給自己買點好東西吧  -買了
- Get yourself something nice from me. - I already did.

229
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,880
-怎么樣  -可好了
- And? - It was very nice.

230
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,830
-嗯  -很有品味  謝謝  斯塔克先生
- Yeah. - Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr Stark.

231
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,470
不客氣  波茨小姐
You're welcome, Miss Potts.

232
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,220
好了
Okay.

233
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,360
你挺厲害  我剛剛以為甩掉你了
You're good. I thought I lost you back there.

234
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,900
是這樣  先生
You did, sir.

235
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,920
我不得不抄穆赫蘭道的捷徑
I had to cut across Mulholland.

236
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,480
被我甩掉了吧
I got you. I got you.

237
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,050
你什么毛病
What's wrong with you?

238
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,680
-怎么了  -三小時
- What? - Three hours.

239
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,720
忙著接受《名利場》的采訪呢
I got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair.

240
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,900
三小時  你讓我在這兒站了三小時
For three hours. For three hours you got me standing here.

241
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,370
現在等你了  走吧  快來
Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on.

242
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,280
起飛  開始吧
Wheels up! Rock and roll!

243
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,780
-你看什么呢  鴨嘴獸  -沒事
- What you reading, platypus? - Nothing.

244
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,090
得了  酸糖娃  別生氣嘛
Come on, sour patch. Don't be mad.

245
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,990
我說了  我沒生氣  我不在乎  好嗎
I told you, I'm not mad. I'm indifferent, okay?

246
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,450
-我都道歉了  -早上好  斯塔克先生
- I said I was sorry. - Good morning, Mr Stark.

247
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,450
你不用向我道歉
You don't need to apologise to me.

248
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,780
-我是你的哥們  -我都跟他道歉了  但他
- I'm your man. - I told him I was sorry, but he...

249
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,590
-我現在就是不在乎了  -熱毛巾要嗎
- I'm just indifferent right now. - Hot towel?

250
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,990
你不尊重自己  所以我知道你不尊重我
You don't respect yourself, so I know you don't respect me.

251
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,100
-我尊重你  -我就是你的保姆
- I respect you. - I'm just your babysitter.

252
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,070
如果你需要換尿布了  謝謝
So, when you need your diaper changed... Thank you.

253
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,620
就告訴我  我去給你拿奶瓶  好嗎
Let me know and I'll get you a bottle, okay?

254
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,040
加熱下清酒  好嗎
Heat up the sake, will you?

255
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,530
-多謝提醒我  -我不是說
- Thanks for reminding me. - No, I'm not talking...

256
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,400
我們不喝酒  我們在工作
We're not drinking. We're working right now.

257
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,730
-吃生魚片一定要配清酒  -你根本就是
- You can't have sashimi without sake. - You are constitutionally

258
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,710
做不到負責任
incapable of being responsible.

259
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,020
不喝酒才不負責
It would be irresponsible not to drink.

260
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,050
不過是一杯睡前酒
I'm just talking about a nightcap.

261
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,280
熱清酒
Hot sake?

262
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,130
好  來兩杯  謝謝
Yes, two, please.

263
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,710
不  我不喝  我不要
No. I'm not drinking. I don't want any.

264
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,080
我就這意思
That's what I'm talking about.

265
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,080
我早上起床  穿上軍服
When I get up in the morning and I'm putting on my uniform,

266
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,190
知道我認得什么嗎
you know what I recognise?

267
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,430
我在鏡子里能看到
I see in that mirror that

268
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,350
每一個穿著這軍服的人都會照應我
every person that's got this uniform on got my back!

269
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,720
知道嗎  我跟你不一樣  我不適合
Hey, you know what? I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...

270
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,800
不  你不非得像我一樣
No, no. You don't have to be like me!

271
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,210
但你遠不止現在的你自己
But you're more than what you are.

272
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,280
抱歉  我現在有點無法集中精神
Can you excuse me if I'm a bit distracted here?

273
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:12,790
不  你現在不能不集中精神  聽我說
No! You can't be distracted right now! Listen to me!

274
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,230
阿富汗  巴格蘭空軍基地

275
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,960
將軍
General.

276
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,430
歡迎  斯塔克先生
Welcome, Mr Stark.

277
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,880
我們很期待您的武器展示
We look forward to your weapons presentation.

278
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:34,840
謝謝
Thanks.

279
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:39,710
被恐懼和被尊敬  哪個更好
Is it better to be feared or respected?

280
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,040
要我說  兩個都要算過分嗎
I say, is it too much to ask for both?

281
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,650
因此  我謙卑地獻上斯塔克工業
With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel

282
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,560
自由系列的旗艦產品
of Stark Industries' Freedom Line.

283
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,600
這是第一個融入了
It's the first missile system

284
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,710
我們的專利沖擊科技的導彈系統
to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology.

285
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,790
人說最好的武器是不需要使用的武器
They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire.

286
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,820
我尊重地表示不同意
I respectfully disagree.

287
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:03,120
我更喜歡你只需要使用一次的武器
I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once.

288
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,400
我老爸就這么做  美國就這么做
That's how Dad did it. That's how America does it.

289
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,370
而且到目前一直挺成功
And it's worked out pretty well so far.

290
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,720
找個借口
Find an excuse

291
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,150
發射一次這玩意  我親自擔保
to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee you

292
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,590
壞蛋再也不會想從洞里爬出來了
the bad guys won't even want to come out of their caves.

293
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,600
供您參考  耶利哥
For your consideration, the Jericho.

294
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,190
每筆超過五億的交易
I'll be throwing one of these in

295
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,740
我送一個這個
with every purchase of 500 million or more.

296
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,860
敬和平
To peace!

297
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,690
-托尼  -奧比  你怎么起來了
- Tony. - Obie, what are you doing up?

298
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,130
不清楚情況我睡不著  展示得怎么樣
I couldn't sleep till I found out how it went. How'd it go?

299
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,510
很好  看來圣誕節要提前了
It went great. Looks like it's gonna be an early Christmas.

300
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:08,120
好樣的  伙計  明天見了
Way to go, my boy! I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

301
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,340
你怎么沒穿我送你的睡衣
Why aren't you wearing those pyjamas I got you?

302
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,900
晚安  托尼
Good night, Tony.

303
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,050
-托尼  -抱歉  這輛車是"歡樂馬"
- Hey, Tony. - I'm sorry, this is the "Fun-vee."

304
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,920
"悍無聊馬"在后面
The "Hum-drum-vee" Is back there.

305
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,880
-好樣的  -基地見
- Nice job. - See you back at base.

306
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,540
我勸你別那么做
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

307
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,340
你對我做了什么
What the hell did you do to me?

308
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,460
我做了什么
What I did?

309
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,150
我做的事是救你命
What I did is to save your life.

310
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,650
我已經盡力移除了很多彈片  但還剩不少
I removed all the shrapnel I could, but there's a lot left,

311
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,000
而且它們都在往你的房隔去
and it's headed into your atrial septum.

312
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,490
想看看嗎
Here, want to see?

313
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,800
我留了紀念品  看看吧
I have a souvenir. Take a look.

314
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,700
我在我的村子里見過不少這樣的傷
I've seen many wounds like that in my village.

315
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,220
我們稱他們為將死行尸
We call them the walking dead

316
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,390
因為大概要一周
because it takes about a week

317
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,340
彈片才會進入重要器官
for the barbs to reach the vital organs.

318
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:39,010
-這是什么  -那是塊電磁鐵
- What is this? - That is an electromagnet,

319
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,170
連在了汽車電池上
hooked up to a car battery,

320
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,880
它在阻止彈片進入你的心臟
and it's keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart.

321
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,800
沒錯  笑笑
That's right. Smile.

322
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,340
我們見過一次  在伯爾尼的一場科技大會上
We met once, you know, at a technical conference in Bern.

323
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,730
-我不記得了  -當然了
- I don't remember. - No, you wouldn't.

324
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,790
如果我喝得那么醉  肯定站都站不直
If I had been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand,

325
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,240
更別說就集成電路發表講話了
much less give a lecture on integrated circuits.

326
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,360
我們在哪
Where are we?

327
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,630
快起來  起來
Come on, stand up. Stand up!

328
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,410
學我的樣子做
Just do as I do.

329
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,480
把手舉起來
Come on, put your hands up.

330
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,340
那是我的槍  他們怎么弄到的
Those are my guns. How did they get my guns?

331
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,590
你聽懂了沒  學我的樣子做
Do you understand me? Do as I do.

332
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:51,540
他說"歡迎  托尼·斯塔克  美國歷史上
He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark, the most famous mass murderer

333
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,440
最著名的大屠殺犯"
in the history of America."

334
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,820
他很榮幸
He is honoured.

335
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,780
他要你給他建導彈
He wants you to build the missile.

336
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,740
你展示的那個耶利哥導彈
The Jericho missile that you demonstrated.

337
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,870
這個
This one.

338
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,250
我拒絕
I refuse.

339
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,840
托尼
Tony!

340
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,940
斯塔克工業

341
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,200
他問你覺得怎么樣
He wants to know what you think.

342
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,130
我覺得你有好多我的武器
I think you got a lot of my weapons.

343
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,670
他說他們有你需要
He says they have everything

344
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,170
拿來建造耶利哥的一切
you need to build the Jericho missile.

345
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,960
他要你列出材料清單
He wants you to make the list of materials.

346
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,850
他說要你立刻開始動手
He says for you to start working immediately,

347
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,970
你做好了  他就放了你
and when you're done, he will set you free.

348
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:55,530
-不  他不會的  -是啊
- No, he won't. - No, he won't.

349
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,680
他們肯定在找你  斯塔克
I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark.

350
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,230
但在這些山里  他們是找不到你的
But they will never find you in these mountains.

351
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,060
你剛剛看到一切
Look, what you just saw,

352
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,880
那就是你的遺產  斯塔克
that is your legacy, Stark.

353
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,820
你一生的心血  落在那些殺人犯手里
Your life's work, in the hands of those murderers.

354
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,420
你想這樣死去嗎
Is that how you want to go out?

355
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,400
這就是偉大的托尼·斯塔克的
Is this the last act of defiance

356
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,850
最后反抗嗎
of the great Tony Stark?

357
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,980
還是說你要想想辦法
Or are you going to do something about it?

358
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,120
我何必還要做點什么
Why should I do anything?

359
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:43,130
他們無論如何都會殺了你  殺了我
They're going to kill me, you, either way.

360
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,490
就算不  我大概也活不過一周
And if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week.

361
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,730
那么
Well, then,

362
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,000
這一周就對你至關重要了吧
this is a very important week for you, isn't it?

363
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,520
如果這里要做我的工作站
If this is going to be my work station,

364
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,310
我要燈火通明  這個豎好
I want it well-lit. I want these up.

365
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,850
我需要焊接工具  乙炔和丙烷的都行
I need welding gear. I don't care if it's acetylene or propane.

366
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,850
我需要焊接工作臺
I need a soldering station.

367
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,260
頭盔  護目鏡
I need helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.

368
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:07,130
我還要熔煉杯  兩組精密工具
I would like a smelting cup. I need two sets of precision tools.

369
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:14,440
斯塔克工業

370
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:22,440
-你說多少種語言  -好多種
- How many languages do you speak? - A lot.

371
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,600
但看來在這里還是不夠用
But apparently, not enough for this place.

372
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,420
他們說阿拉伯語  烏爾都語
They speak Arabic, Urdu,

373
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,120
達里語  帕施圖語
dari, Pashto,

374
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,130
蒙古語  波斯語  俄語
Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.

375
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,300
他們是什么人
Who are these people?

376
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:36,830
他們是你的忠實顧客  先生
They are your loyal customers, sir.

377
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,240
他們自稱"十戒組織"
They call themselves the Ten Rings.

378
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,790
如果你告訴我你的計劃
You know, we might be more productive

379
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,160
我們的動作可能會更快
if you include me in the planning process.

380
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,510
好吧  我們不需要這個
Okay, we don't need this.

381
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,380
那是什么
What is that?

382
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:11,200
鈀  0.15克
That's palladium, 0.15 grammes.

383
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,610
我們需要至少1.6
We need at least 1.6,

384
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,640
你去把另外11個拆了吧
so why don't you go break down the other 11?

385
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,050
他在干什么
What's he doing?

386
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,190
干活兒
Working.

387
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,350
小心  我們只有一次機會
Careful. Careful, we only get one shot at this.

388
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,450
放心  我手很穩
Relax. I have steady hands.

389
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,840
要不你怎么會還活著
Why do you think you're still alive?

390
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,480
-怎么稱呼你  -我叫殷森
- What do I call you? - My name is Yinsen.

391
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,920
殷森  認識你很高興
Yinsen. Nice to meet you.

392
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,730
我也很高興認識你
Nice to meet you, too.

393
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,600
那看上去不像耶利哥導彈
That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.

394
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,390
因為那是個迷你方舟反應堆
That's because it's a miniaturised arc reactor.

395
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,710
我家里有個大的給我的工廠供電
I got a big one powering my factory at home.

396
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,220
這應該足以阻止彈片進入我的心臟
It should keep the shrapnel out of my heart.

397
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,770
但它能產生什么
But what could it generate?

398
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,830
如果我沒算錯  我通常不會算錯
If my math is right, and it always is,

399
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,870
每秒能產生3千兆焦耳
three gigajoules per second.

400
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,680
那足以讓你的心跳50輩子
That could run your heart for 50 lifetimes.

401
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,690
或者讓什么大玩意跑15分鐘
Or something big for 15 minutes.

402
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,840
-這是我們逃離的方法  -是什么
- This is our ticket out of here. - What is it?

403
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,900
攤平了看
Flatten them out and look.

404
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:24,070
厲害
Impressive.

405
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,310
很好
Good.

406
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,250
下得好
Good roll. Good roll.

407
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,420
你還沒跟我說你是哪里人
You still haven't told me where you're from.

408
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,520
我來自一個叫科米拉的小鎮
I'm from a small town called Gulmira.

409
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:04,330
-那里其實很不錯  -有家人嗎
- It's actually a nice place. - Got a family?

410
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:08,850
有  等我離開這里  就能見到他們
Yes, and I will see them when I leave here.

411
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,680
你呢  斯塔克
And you, Stark?

412
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,770
-沒有  -沒有嗎
- No. - No?

413
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,690
你是個擁有一切的人
So you're a man who has everything

414
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,660
卻一無所有
and nothing.

415
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,770
看上去完全不像照片上的東西
It doesn't look anything like the picture.

416
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,480
或許是改裝過了
Maybe it's been modified.

417
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,550
尾翼不對
The tail is wrong.

418
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,000
就是倒過來了
It's just backwards.

419
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,380
放松
Relax.

420
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,760
弓和箭
The bow and arrow

421
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,830
曾是武器科技的巔峰
once was the pinnacle of weapons technology.

422
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,360
讓偉大的成吉思汗
It allowed the great Genghis Khan

423
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:26,680
一統從太平洋到烏克蘭之間的土地
to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.

424
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,930
他的帝國是亞歷山大大帝的兩倍
An empire twice the size of Alexander the Great

425
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,550
是羅馬帝國的四倍
and four times the size of the Roman Empire.

426
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:40,270
但今天
But today,

427
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,100
有最新的斯塔克工業武器的人
whoever holds the latest Stark weapons

428
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,690
就能統治這些土地

429
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,040
很快
And soon,

430
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,860
就要輪到我了
it will be my turn.

431
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,890
你為什么讓我失望了
Why have you failed me?

432
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,910
我們在工作
We're working.

433
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,880
非常努力
Diligently.

434
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,750
我留了你一命
I let you live.

435
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,150
你就如此回報我嗎
This is how you repay me?

436
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,840
工作復雜
It's very complex.

437
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,450
他已經很盡力了
He's trying very hard.

438
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,580
讓他跪下
On his knees.

439
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,940
你當我傻嗎
You think I'm a fool?

440
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,920
我會問出真相的
I'll get the truth.

441
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,290
我們都在工作
We're both working.

442
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,350
張開嘴
Open your mouth.

443
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,820
他要什么
What does he want?

444
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,350
你當我傻嗎
You think I'm a fool?

445

What's going on?

告訴我實話
Tell me the truth.

447

他在給你做耶利哥

448
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,770
你要什么  完成日期嗎

好  再說一遍

Your eyes are red. A few tears for your long-lost boss?

我不參加問答的
I'm not part of the press conference,

531
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,510
但記者招待會馬上就開始
but it's about to begin right now.

532
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,570
我不是記者
I'm not a reporter.

533
00:43:58,750 --> 00:43:59,870
我是菲爾·科爾森特工
I'm Agent Phil Coulson,

534
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,150
我隸屬國土戰略防御攻擊
with the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement

535
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,940
與后勤保障局
and Logistics Division.

536
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:06,730
-好拗口  -是啊  我們還在改進
- That's quite a mouthful. - I know. We're working on it.

537
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,200
國防部  聯調局和中情局
You know, we've been approached already

538
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:11,180
都已經找過我們了
by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...

539
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:14,790
我們是獨立部門  目標更明確專一
We're a separate division with a more specific focus.

540
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,090
我們需要詢問斯塔克先生
We need to debrief Mr Stark

541
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,750
關于他逃脫的具體情況
about the circumstances of his escape.

542
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,310
-我會加到日程里的  好嗎  -謝謝
- I'll put something in the book, shall I? - Thank you.

543
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:29,560
大家可以坐下嗎
Hey, would it be all right if everyone sat down?

544
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:30,470
你們都坐下吧
Why don't you just sit down?

545
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,270
這樣你們都能看到我  我也能...
That way you can see me, and I can...

546
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,620
這樣不那么正式
A little less formal and...

547
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:42,850
-怎么變成嬉皮士聚會了  -別問我
- What's up with the love-in? - Don't look at me.

548
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,280
我不知道他是想干什么
I don't know what he's up to.

549
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,620
-見到你真好  -我也是
- Good to see you. - Good to see you.

550
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:49,240
我沒能跟爸爸說再見
I never got to say goodbye to Dad.

551
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,980
我沒能跟我父親說再見
I never got to say goodbye to my father.

552
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,010
我有些問題想問他
There's questions that I would have asked him.

553
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,580
我想問他對公司的作為怎么看
I would have asked him how he felt about what this company did.

554
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:05,020
他是否有過掙扎  有過懷疑
If he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts.

555
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,930
或許他就完全是
Or maybe he was every inch

556
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,540
新聞紀錄片里的那個男人
the man we all remember from the newsreels.

557
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,410
我看到了年輕的美國人被殺
I saw young Americans killed

558
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:22,430
殺害他們的正是我為了維護他們而制造的武器
by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them.

559
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:25,160
我還看到
And I saw that I

560
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:27,350
我已經成為了
had become part of a system

561
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,940
不愿負擔責任的系統的一員
that is comfortable with zero accountability.

562
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:33,120
-斯塔克先生  -本
- Mr Stark! - Hey, Ben.

563
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,040
你在那里經歷了什么
What happened over there?

564
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:40,280
我開了眼界  我意識到我可以為
I had my eyes opened. I came to realise that I have more

565
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:44,710
這世界做更多  而不只是制造爆炸
to offer this world than just making things that blow up.

566
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,380
因此  即刻生效  我要關閉
And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down

567
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:51,320
斯塔克國際公司的武器生產部
the weapons manufacturing division of Stark lnternational

568
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,630
直到
until such a time

569
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,270
我決定好公司的未來
as I can decide what the future of the company will be.

570
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,160
-大家這下不愁  -決定好它的走向
- I think we're gonna be... -  What direction it should take,

571
00:45:58,170 --> 00:45:59,700
-賣不出報紙了  -我能接受的
- selling a lot of newspapers. - one that l'm comfortable with

572
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:01,980
并且與國家最高利益
and is consistent with the highest good

573
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:03,520
一致的走向
for this country, as well.

574
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,940
我們應該記住的
What we should take away from this

575
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,270
是托尼回來了
is that Tony's back!

576
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,010
而且非常健康
And he's healthier than ever.

577
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,070
我們將進行內部探討
We're going to have a little internal discussion

578
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,550
隨后向大家通報
and we'll get back to you with the follow-up.

579
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,110
-他人呢  -在里面
- Where is he? - He's inside.

580
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,890
那...挺順利嘛
Well, that... That went well.

581
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,330
我是在腦后放了個靶子嗎
Did I just paint a target on the back of my head?

582
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,750
你的腦袋  那我的腦袋呢
Your head? What about my head?

583
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,310
你覺得明天股價
What do you think the over-under on the stock

584
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,930
會跌到什么程度
drop is gonna be tomorrow?

585
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:48,070
-樂觀估計  40點  -至少
- Optimistically, 40 points. - At minimum.

586
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,400
是啊
Yep.

587
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:52,930
托尼  我們是武器制造商
Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.

588
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,610
奧比  我不希望我們將來只留下殺傷數字
Obie, I just don't want a body count to be our only legacy.

589
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:56,740
這是我們的工作
That's what we do.

590
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,570
我們是鐵商  我們制造武器
We're iron mongers. We make weapons.

591
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,520
大樓上是我的名字
It's my name on the side of the building.

592
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:02,400
我們的工作讓世界不會陷入混亂
And what we do keeps the world from falling into chaos.

593
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:03,860
我看到的可不是這樣
Not based on what I saw.

594
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,530
我們做得不夠好
We're not doing a good enough job.

595
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,750
我們可以做得更好  我們要做別的
We can do better. We're gonna do something else.

596
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,990
什么別的  你要我們做奶瓶嗎
Like what? You want us to make baby bottles?

597
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:15,230
我認為我們該重新考慮方舟反應堆科技
I think we should take another look into arc reactor technology.

598
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:19,740
得了  方舟反應堆就是個噱頭
Come on. The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

599
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:20,640
托尼  拜托
Tony, come on.

600
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,060
我們建這個是為了堵嬉皮士的嘴
We built that thing to shut the hippies up!

601
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:26,770
-成功了  -是啊  作為科學項目
- It works. - Yeah, as a science project.

602
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:28,200
方舟反應堆的效益性根本不好
The arc was never cost effective.

603
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:30,120
我們建造之前就知道了
We knew that before we built it.

604
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:33,340
方舟反應堆科技是個死胡同  是吧
Arc reactor technology, that's a dead end, right?

605
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,390
或許吧
Maybe.

606
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:37,780
是吧  我們在這方面多久沒有突破了
Am I right? We haven't had a breakthrough in that in what?

607
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:39,560
-30年嗎  -據說是的
- Thirty years. - That's what they say.

608
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,100
你的撲克臉能更糟點嗎  告訴我  誰說的
Could you have a lousier poker face? Just tell me, who told you?

609
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:48,350
-別管了  給我看  -羅德還是派珀
- Never mind who told me. Show me. - It's Rhodey or Pepper.

610
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,350
-我要看  -好吧  是羅德
- I want to see it. - Okay, Rhodey.

611
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,940
-好吧  -行嗎
- Okay. - Okay?

612
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:04,980
成功了
It works.

613
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:13,420
聽我說  托尼  我們是一隊的  懂嗎
Listen to me, Tony. We're a team. Do you understand?

614
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:16,670
只要我們合力  沒什么是做不到的
There's nothing we can't do if we stick together,

615
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,300
就像當年我和你父親
like your father and I.

616
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:20,340
抱歉我沒提前跟你商量
I'm sorry I didn't give you a heads-up, okay?

617
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:21,680
-但如果我說了  -托尼
- But if I had... - Tony.

618
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,100
托尼  別再干這種脫口而出的事了
Tony, no more of this "ready, fire, aim" business.

619
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,970
-明白嗎  -那是老爸常說的話
- You understand me? - That was Dad's line.

620
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:30,590
你得讓我來處理
You gotta let me handle this.

621
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,960
我們現在得玩另一套把戲了
We're gonna have to play a whole different kind of ball now.

622
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:35,010
我們要承受很大壓力
We're going to have to take a lot of heat.

623
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:38,480
我要你保證  你會低調些
I want you to promise me that you're gonna lay low.

624
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:40,330
斯塔克工業
Stark lndustries!

625
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:43,490
我給你推薦條路  準備好了嗎
I've got one recommendation! Ready? Ready?

626
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:44,630
賣賣賣
Sell, sell, sell!

627
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,880
棄船
Abandon ship!

628
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:50,350
興登堡飛艇的事記得嗎
Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?

629
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:52,520
我給大家看看
Let me show you

630
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:56,790
新斯塔克工業的商業計劃
the new Stark lndustries business plan!

631
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:02,080
這就是一家不造武器的武器公司
Look, that's a weapons company that doesn't make weapons!

632
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,450
派珀  你的手有多大
Pepper. How big are your hands?

633
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:07,980
-什么  -你的手有多大
- What? - How big are your hands?

634
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:11,030
-我不懂這...  -下來  我需要你
- I don't understand why... - Get down here. I need you.

635
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,870
伸出來  給我看看你的手
Let's see them. Show me your hands.

636
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,020
給我看看
Let's see them.

637
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:27,940
好小  好精巧
They are small. Very petite, indeed.

638
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,770
我需要你幫個忙
I just need your help for a sec.

639
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:34,100
天吶  那就是維系你生命的東西嗎
Oh, my God, is that the thing that's keeping you alive?

640
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:37,300
之前是  現在是古董了
It was. It is now an antique.

641
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:40,320
這個將在未來一段時間內維系我的生命
This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future.

642
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:41,850
我要換升級版的
I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit,

643
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:44,900
現在遭遇了點障礙
and I just ran into a little speed bump.

644
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:46,640
障礙  什么意思
Speed bump, what does that mean?

645
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,780
沒事  就是個小問題
It's nothing. It's just a little snag.

646
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:51,460
這個裝置下面有條暴露的電線
There's an exposed wire under this device.

647
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:52,940
接觸到了槽壁
And it's contacting the socket wall

648
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:54,580
造成了短路
and causing a little bit of a short.

649
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:56,860
沒事的
It's fine.

650
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,800
-你要我做什么  -放在那邊桌上
- What do you want me to do? - Put that on the table over there.

651
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:01,120
-那個沒用了  -天吶
- That is irrelevant. - Oh, my God!

652
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:02,580
你伸手進去
I want you to reach in,

653
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:04,950
輕輕地把電線拉出來
and you're just gonna gently lift the wire out.

654
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,260
-安全嗎  -應該沒事
- Is it safe? - Yeah, it should be fine.

655
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:09,670
就像手術游戲  別讓電線
It's like Operation. You just don't let it

656
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,930
碰到槽壁就行  否則就會發出嗶聲
touch the socket wall or it goes "beep."

657
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:12,760
什么"手術游戲"
What do you mean, "Operation"?

658
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,100
就是個游戲  算了
It's just a game, never mind.

659
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:16,430
-輕輕地把電線拉出來  -好
- Just gently lift the wire. - Okay.

660
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:18,320
好嗎  很好
Okay? Great.

661
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,590
我覺得我做這個不夠格
You know, I don't think that I'm qualified to do this.

662
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,600
你可以的  你是我認識的最夠格
No, you're fine. You're the most capable, qualified,

663
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:30,170
最值得信賴的人  你會做得很棒的
trustworthy person I've ever met. You're gonna do great.

664
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:33,410
這個要求太過分了嗎  因為我
Is it too much of a problem to ask? 'Cause I'm...

665
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,470
-好吧  -我真的需要你幫忙
- Okay, okay. - I really need your help here.

666
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:37,340
好了
Okay.

667
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,370
有膿液
Oh, there's pus!

668
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:44,320
不是膿液
It's not pus.

669
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:47,990
是裝置釋放出的無機原生質
It's an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device,

670
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,190
-不是我身體分泌的  -好臭
- not from my body. - It smells!

671
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,350
是啊
Yeah, it does.

672
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:54,410
銅線  銅線  摸到了嗎
The copper wire. The copper wire, you got it?

673
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:55,900
-好  摸到了  -摸到了嗎
- Okay, I got it! I got it! - Okay, you got it?

674
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:58,800
拉出來時不要碰到槽壁
Now, don't let it touch the sides when you're coming out!

675
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:01,060
-我之前就是跟你強調這個  -抱歉
- That's what I was trying to tell you before. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

676
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:03,510
拉出來時  一定不要拉出...
Okay, now make sure that when you pull it out, you don't...

677
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,970
最末端的磁鐵
There's a magnet at the end of it!

678
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,700
就這個  你給拉出來了
That was it. You just pulled it out.

679
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:08,060
-天吶  -我沒想到...
- Oh, God! - Okay, I was not expecting...

680
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:09,910
-別放回去  -我怎么辦
- Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in! - Okay, what do I do?

681
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:11,180
怎么了
What's wrong?

682
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:12,750
沒事  我就是要心臟驟停了
Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest

683
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,830
-因為你像撈魚一樣  -什么
- 'cause you yanked - What?

684
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:15,560
-把它揪出來了  -你不是說挺安全的嗎
- it out like a trout... - I though you said it was safe!

685
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:16,800
我們得快了  拿這個
We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.

686
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:19,470
-迅速換好  -好
- You gotta switch it out really quick. - Okay. Okay.

687
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,370
-托尼  -什么
- Tony? - What?

688
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:21,590
-會沒事的  -是嗎
- It's going to be okay. - Is it?

689
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,580
不會有事的
It's gonna be okay.

690
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:24,780
-我會搞定的  -希望如此
- I'm gonna make this okay. - Let's hope.

691
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:27,960
把那個接到底盤上
Okay, you're gonna attach that to the base plate.

692
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,890
務必要
Make sure you...

693
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,760
很難嗎
Was that so hard?

694
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:36,090
挺好玩的吧
That was fun, right?

695
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,870
好了  給我吧
Here, I got it. I got it. Here.

696
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:39,600
好樣的
Nice.

697
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:42,840
-你沒事吧  -嗯  我很好  你沒事吧
- Are you okay? - Yeah, I feel great. You okay?

698
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,600
永遠永遠永遠
Don't ever, ever, ever,

699
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:50,670
別再要求我做這樣的事了
ever ask me to do anything like that ever again.

700
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,700
我只有你
I don't have anyone but you.

701
00:51:58,350 --> 00:51:59,370
好了
Anyway...

702
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,560
-這個你要我怎么處理  -那個嗎
- What do you want me to do with this? - That?

703
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,010
毀掉
Destroy it.

704
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,020
焚毀
Incinerate it.

705
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,390
你不想留著嗎
You don't want to keep it?

706
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,290
派珀  人們說我有很多特點
Pepper, I've been called many things.

707
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,070
但不包括"懷舊"
"Nostalgic" is not one of them.

708
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:20,850
沒別的事了吧  斯塔克先生
Will that be all, Mr Stark?

709
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:22,450
沒事了  波茨小姐
That will be all, Miss Potts.

710
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,390
笨手笨腳  過來
Hey, Butterfingers, come here.

711
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,610
我桌上這堆東西怎么回事
What's all this stuff doing on top of my desk?

712
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:30,850
那是我的手機  那是我跟爸爸的合照
That's my phone, that's a picture of me and my dad.

713
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:33,780
那里  垃圾堆里
Right there. In the garbage. All that stuff.

714
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:44,690
空中戰斗的未來  是有人還是無人
The future of air combat. Is it manned or unmanned?

715
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,900
以我的經驗
I'll tell you, in my experience,

716
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:49,070
無人機永遠
no unmanned aerial vehicle

717
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:52,030
比不過飛行員的直覺
will ever trump a pilot's instinct,

718
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,480
見解
his insight,

719
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:56,250
以及看透表象
that ability to look into a situation beyond the obvious

720
00:52:56,260 --> 00:53:00,170
確定結果的判斷力
and discern its outcome, or a pilot's judgement.

721
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:03,190
中校  何不讓飛行員擺脫飛機
Colonel? Why not a pilot without the plane?

722
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,430
看看是誰從天而降  托尼·斯塔克先生
Look who fell out of the sky. Mr Tony Stark.

723
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:07,200
-你好  先生  -說到有人無人[是不是男人]
- Hello, sir. - Speaking of manned or unmanned,

724
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:07,850
你們一定要問他
you gotta get him to tell you

725
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:09,600
有年春假猜錯答案的那次
about the time he guessed wrong at spring break.

726
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,960
記住  春假  1987年
Just remember that, spring break, 1987.

727
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,220
-跟你一起醒來的那位美麗女士  -別鬧
- That lovely lady you woke up with. - Don't do that!

728
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,820
-他叫什么來著  -別鬧
- What was his name? - Don't do that.

729
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:15,970
-埃文嗎  -別鬧
- Was it Ivan? - Don't do that.

730
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,290
他們會信的  別鬧
They'll believe it. Don't do that.

731
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:18,480
-好吧  -別鬧
- Okay. - Don't do that.

732
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:21,340
-認識你們很高興  -讓我們聊會兒
- Pleasure meeting you. - Give us a couple minutes, you guys.

733
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:26,140
-我很意外  -為什么
- I'm surprised. - Why?

734
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,030
我沒想到這么快就能見到你起來走動
I swear, I didn't expect to see you walking around so soon.

735
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:30,850
我可不止是走動
I'm doing a little better than walking.

736
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:32,240
-真的  -嗯
- Really? - Yeah.

737
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:34,830
羅德  我在研究個大項目
Rhodey, I'm working on something big.

738
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:38,820
我是來找你的  我希望你也參與進來
I came to talk to you. I want you to be a part of it.

739
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:40,570
你要讓這里
You're about to make

740
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:42,570
很多人開心起來了
a whole lot of people around here real happy,

741
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:45,690
因為之前記者招待會上的那個表演
'cause that little stunt at the press conference,

742
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:47,030
太逗了
that was a doozy.

743
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:52,270
這不是給軍隊的  我不...這不一樣
This is not for the military. I'm not... It's different.

744
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:55,010
怎么  你成人道主義者了
What? You're a humanitarian now or something?

745
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:56,510
-我需要你聽我說  -不
- I need you to listen to me. - No.

746
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:00,610
你需要時間把思緒理清楚
What you need is time to get your mind right.

747
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,110
-我說真的  -好吧
- I'm serious. - Okay.

748
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:08,200
很高興見到你  托尼
It's nice seeing you, Tony.

749
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:09,980
謝謝
Thanks.

750
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:20,170
賈維斯  你在嗎
Jarvis, you up?

751
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,070
為您  先生  永遠都在
For you, sir, always.

752
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,760
我想建立新項目文檔  標注為馬克2號
I'd like to open a new project file, index as Mark II.

753
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:30,840
要將文件存儲到斯塔克工業中央數據庫中嗎
Shall I store this on the Stark lndustries Central Database?

754
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,390
其實  我不知道現在能信任誰
Actually, I don't know who to trust right now.

755
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:34,410
直到我另說
Till further notice,

756
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:36,580
先把東西都存在我的私人服務器上吧
why don't we just keep everything on my private server?

757
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:39,120
在研究秘密項目嗎  先生
Working on a secret project, are we, sir?

758
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,320
我不希望這玩意落入壞人之手
I don't want this winding up in the wrong hands.

759
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,560
或許在我手里  它能做好事
Maybe in mine, it can actually do some good.

760
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:37,280
下一個  上去
Next. Up.

761
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:40,310
不是靴子  呆呆  這里  懂嗎
Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here. You got me?

762
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:42,630
別動  很好
Stay put. Nice.

763
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:47,740
你真沒用  往下到腳趾  我來吧
You're of no benefit at all. Move down to the toe. I got this.

764
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,750
好吧  對不起  我妨礙你了嗎
Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way?

765
00:55:57,950 --> 00:55:58,920
上去
Up.

766
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:01,500
算了  別動
Screw it. Don't even move.

767
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:05,340
你真是個悲劇
You are a tragedy.

768
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,070
好了  我們好好做吧
Okay, let's do this right.

769
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:20,300
開始量步  半米  正中央
Start mark, half a metre, and back and centre.

770
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:25,890
呆呆  精神點  準備滅火
Dummy, look alive. You're on standby for fire safety.

771
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:27,300
你  開拍
You, roll it.

772
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:33,440
好  啟動手動控制
Okay. Activate hand controls.

773
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,910
慢慢開始
We're gonna start off nice and easy.

774
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:41,780
看看10%的推進能量能否實現上升
We're gonna see if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift.

775
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:43,280
三
And three,

776
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:45,190
二
two,

777
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:46,950
一
one.

778
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,840
上2  好  定位
Up two. All right, set that.

779
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,130
我一直在摁鈴  沒聽到對講機響嗎
I've been buzzing you. Did you hear the intercom?

780
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,730
嗯  都...什么
Yeah, everything's... What?

781
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,370
-奧巴代亞在樓上  -好啊
- Obadiah's upstairs. - Great!

782
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:33,960
-要我怎么跟他說  -好  我就上去
- What would you like me to tell him? - Great. I'll be right up.

783
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:35,860
好
Okay.

784
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,730
你不是說你不做武器了嗎
I thought you said you were done making weapons.

785
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:39,680
是的
It is.

786
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:43,710
這是飛行穩定器  完全無害
This is a flight stabiliser. It's completely harmless.

787
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:49,190
這我沒料到
I didn't expect that.

788
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,360
怎么樣
How'd it go?

789
00:57:58,370 --> 00:57:59,720
那么不順利啊
It went that bad, huh?

790
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,410
就因為我從紐約帶了披薩回來
Just because I brought pizza back from New York

791
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:04,070
不代表就不順利
doesn't mean it went bad.

792
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:06,400
當然了  天吶
Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

793
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,490
如果你去了還能順利點
It would have gone better if you were there.

794
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:11,150
你叫我低調的  所以我照做了
You told me to lay low. That's what I've been doing.

795
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:12,530
我低調  你處理好...
I lay low, and you take care of all...

796
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:16,350
拜托  那是指在公眾  媒體面前
Hey, come on. In public. The press.

797
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,430
這可是董事會會議
This was a board of directors meeting.

798
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:21,270
是董事會會議嗎
This was a board of directors meeting?

799
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:24,630
董事會稱你患了創傷后應激癥
The board is claiming you have post traumatic stress.

800
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:25,810
他們提交了禁止令
They're filing an injunction.

801
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:27,950
-什么  -他們要阻攔你
- A what? - They want to lock you out.

802
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:29,380
怎么  因為股票跌了40點嗎
Why, 'cause the stocks dipped 40 points?

803
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,250
我們早知道會這樣
We knew that was gonna happen.

804
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:32,500
-是56.5  -這無所謂
- Fifty-six and a half. - It doesn't matter.

805
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,760
我們擁有公司的控股權
We own the controlling interest in the company.

806
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:38,240
托尼  董事會也有權利
Tony, the board has rights, too.

807
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:42,400
他們稱  你和你的新方向
They're making the case that you and your new direction

808
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,740
-對公司不是最有利的  -我這是負責任
- isn't in the company's best interest. - I'm being responsible!

809
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:47,560
這是我和公司的新方向
That's a new direction for me, for the company.

810
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:50,370
我要代表公司
I mean, me on the company's behalf

811
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:52,370
負起責任
being responsible for the way that...

812
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:53,900
這真好
This is great.

813
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:57,070
-得了  托尼  -我去工作室
- Oh, come on. Tony. Tony. - I'll be in the shop.

814
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,310
托尼  聽我說
Tony. Listen.

815
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,320
我在努力挽回局面
I'm trying to turn this thing around,

816
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,930
但你得給我點東西
but you gotta give me something.

817
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:04,480
拿給他們看的東西
Something to pitch them.

818
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:07,080
讓工程師分析下那個
Let me have the engineers analyse that.

819
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:08,240
畫出參數圖紙
You know, draw up some specs.

820
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,270
-不行  絕對不行  -讓我有根骨頭丟給
- No. No, absolutely not. - It'll give me a bone to throw the boys

821
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:12,140
-這個留在我身上  -紐約的人
- This one stays with me. - in New York!

822
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:13,160
就是這樣  奧比  別想了
That's it, Obie. Forget it.

823
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,970
好  那這個留在我這兒
All right, well, this stays with me, then.

824
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,790
來吧  你可以拿走一塊
Go on, here, you can have a piece.

825
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:18,120
-拿兩個吧  -謝謝
- Take two. - Thank you.

826
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:20,480
我可以下去看看你在做什么嗎
You mind if I come down there and see what you're doing?

827
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,650
晚安  奧比
Good night, Obie.

828
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:26,360
第11天  第37次測試  配置2.0
Day 11 , test 37, configuration 2.0.

829
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,550
因為沒有更好的選擇
For lack of a better option,

830
00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:30,450
仍由呆呆負責滅火  你再敢噴我
Dummy is still on fire safety. If you douse me again,

831
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:33,100
而且是我沒著火時  我就把你捐給城市學院
and I'm not on fire, I'm donating you to a city college.

832
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:34,730
慢慢來
All right, nice and easy.

833
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:40,290
真的  就從1%推進能量開始
Seriously, just gonna start off with 1% thrust capacity.

834
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:44,110
三  二  一
And three, two, one.

835
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:56,550
好的
Okay.

836
00:59:58,290 --> 00:59:59,440
別拿那玩意時刻指著我
Please don't follow me around with it, either,

837
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:02,190
讓我覺得我隨時會自燃
'cause I feel like I'm gonna catch on fire spontaneously.

838
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:04,020
退后點  如果真出事了再沖上來
Just stand down! If something happens, then come in.

839
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:06,050
再來  能量加到2.5%
And again, let's bring it up to 2.5.

840
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,390
三  二  一
Three, two, one.

841
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,310
好吧  我不想到這里來
Okay, this is where I don't want to be!

842
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:28,900
別燒車
Not the car, not the car!

843
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:30,890
桌子
Table!

844
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,810
還算可以  沒事的
Could be worse! Could be worse! We're fine!

845
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:46,710
好
Okay.

846
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:04,750
不
No!

847
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:09,660
好啊  我能飛了
Yeah, I can fly.

848
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:16,620
-賈維斯  在嗎  -隨時候命  先生
- Jarvis, are you there? - At your service, sir.

849
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:19,570
-啟動前置顯示  -已啟動

850
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:21,650
從本地界面輸入偏好
Import all preferences from home interface.

851
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:22,810
好的  先生
Will do, sir.

852
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,260
好  怎么樣
All right, what do you say?

853
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:33,260
我已經上傳好了  先生
I have indeed been uploaded, sir.

854
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:34,850
我們已經上線  準備好了
We're online and ready.

855
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:36,450
可以開始虛擬行走嗎
Can we start the virtual walk-around?

856
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:39,590
正在輸入偏好  校準虛擬環境
Importing preferences and calibrating virtual environment.

857
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:41,180
檢查控制表面
Do a check on control surfaces.

858
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:42,380
如您所愿
As you wish.

859
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:07,650
測試完成  準備關機  開始診斷
Test complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics.

860
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:09,930
嗯  這樣吧  檢查天氣和航空管制
Yeah. Tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check.

861
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:11,480
并監聽地面控制
Start listening in on ground control.

862
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:12,690
先生  真正飛行之前
Sir, there are still terabytes

863
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:15,470
還需要進行兆兆字節的計算
of calculations needed before an actual flight is...

864
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:19,420
賈維斯  有時候要先跑才能走
Jarvis! Sometimes you got to run before you can walk.

865
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:23,990
準備好了嗎  三  二  一
Ready? In three, two, one.

866
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:48,290
操作流暢
Handles like a dream.

867
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:18,680
好了  看看這玩意的本事如何
All right, let's see what this thing can do.

868
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:20,040
SR-71偵察機的記錄是多少
What's SR-71's record?

869
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,950
固定翼飛行的飛行高度記錄為8.5萬英尺
The altitude record for fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.

870
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:26,360
記錄就是用來打破的  來啊
Records are made to be broken! Come on!

871
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:33,330
先生  出現了可能致命的結冰
Sir, there is a potentially fatal buildup of ice occurring.

872
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:35,060
繼續走
Come on!

873
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:38,210
再高點
Higher!

874
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:54,690
我們結冰了  賈維斯  展開襟翼
We iced up, Jarvis! Deploy flaps!

875
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:56,860
賈維斯
Jarvis!

876
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:01,070
拜托  我們得除冰
Come on, we got to break the ice!

877
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:37,820
關閉動力
Kill power.

878
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,220
派珀送

879
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:25,710
托尼·斯塔克有心的證明

880
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,810
記錄  主傳感器在4萬英尺以上變得遲緩
Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish at plus 40 altitude.

881
01:06:05,810 --> 01:06:07,680
殼體增壓是個問題
Hull pressurisation is problematic.

882
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,360
我認為結冰可能是影響因素
I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.

883
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,570
觀察敏銳  先生
A very astute observation, sir.

884
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:14,360
或許  如果您打算造訪其他星球
Perhaps, if you intend to visit other planets,

885
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,010
我們應該改進排氣系統
we should improve the exo systems.

886
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:18,630
與思科連接  重新配置外殼金屬
Connect to the Cisco. Have it reconfigure the shell metals.

887
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:21,800
使用六翼天使戰術衛星的金鈦合金
Use the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite.

888
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,650
這樣應該能保證外殼不受損
That should ensure a fuselage integrity

889
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:25,810
而不影響動力-重量比
while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.

890
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:27,080
-知道了嗎  -是
- Got it? - Yes.

891
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,610
我要按提議方案進行渲染嗎
Shall I render using proposed specifications?

892
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:30,690
好好發揮吧
Thrill me.

893
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:35,320
今晚迪士尼音樂廳的
Tonight's red-hot red carpet is right here

894
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,940
紅毯異常火熱
at the Disney Concert Hall,

895
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:38,550

897
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:42,700
洛杉磯上流社會蜂擁而至
has become the place to be for L.A.'s high society.

898
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,290
賈維斯  我們收到邀請了嗎
Jarvis, we get an invite for that?

899
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,860
我沒有邀請的記錄  先生
I have no record of an invitation, sir.

900
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:48,470
自從那場怪異
...hasn't been seen in public

901
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:52,340
且極具爭議的記者招待會后就未曾公開露面
since his bizarre and highly controversial press conference.

902
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:55,090
有些人稱他患有創傷后應激癥
Some claim he's suffering from post traumatic stress

903
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:59,020
已經臥床數周  不管真相如何
and has been bedridden for weeks. Whatever the case may be,

904
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:02,170
沒有人指望他今晚出現
no one expects an appearance from him tonight.

905
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:03,710
渲染已完成
The render is complete.

906
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:06,070
有點招搖了吧
A little ostentatious, don't you think?

907
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:08,900
我怎么想的  您一般都很低調的
What was I thinking? You're usually so discreet.

908
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:13,520
這樣吧  加上點火紅色
Tell you what. Throw a little hot-rod red in there.

909
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,950
嗯  這樣就低調了
Yes, that should help you keep a low profile.

910
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:21,250
渲染完成
The render is complete.

911
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,880
我喜歡  制造上色吧
Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.

912

估計完成時間  五小時
Estimated completion time is five hours.

914
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:30,290
別等我了  親愛的
Don't wait up for me, honey.

915
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:55,270
武器制造
Weapons manufacturing

916
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:58,760
只是斯塔克工業的一小部分
is only one small part of what Stark Industries is all about,

917
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:02,000
我們與火災救援群體的合作
and our partnership with the fire and rescue community...

918
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:07,120
-托尼  記得我嗎  -完全不
- Hey, Tony, remember me? - Sure don't.

919
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:09,760
氣色真不錯  海夫
You look great, Hef.

920
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:13,160
這一季我們會表現出色的
We're going to have a great quarter.

921
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,010
這世界是怎么了
What's the world coming to

922
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:16,040
來自己的派對都沒有請柬
when a guy's got to crash his own party?

923
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,120
看看你
Look at you.

924
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:21,310
真是意外
Hey, what a surprise.

925
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:22,370
里面見
I'll see you inside.

926
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,840
聽著  悠著點
Listen, take it slow, all right?

927
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,770
我覺得我已經安撫好董事會了
I think I got the board right where we want them.

928
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:31,400
好嘞  我就是憋壞了  就玩一會兒
You got it. Just cabin fever. I'll just be a minute.

929
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:38,660
給我杯威士忌  我餓死了
Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.

930
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:40,710
斯塔克先生
Mr Stark?

931
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,370
-怎么  -科爾森特工
- Yeah? - Agent Coulson.

932
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:45,590
是啊  你是那個...
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The guy from the...

933
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:47,240
國土戰略防御
Strategic Homeland Intervention,

934
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,120
攻擊與后勤保障局
Enforcement and Logistics Division.

935
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,810
天吶  你們需要新名字了
God, you need a new name for that.

936
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:52,630
是啊  我常聽人這么說
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

937
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,410
聽著  我知道您現在一定很不容易
Listen, I know this must be a trying time for you,

938
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:57,120
但我們需要了解情況
but we need to debrief you.

939
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:58,990
還有很多問題未得到解答
There's still a lot of unanswered questions,

940
01:08:58,990 --> 01:09:01,470
這種事情  時間有時很重要
and time can be a factor with these things.

941
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:03,050
我們約個時間吧
Let's just put something on the books.

942
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:07,090
24日晚7點在斯塔克工業見如何
How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m. at Stark Industries?

943
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:10,410
這樣吧  說定了  你說得很對
Tell you what. You got it. You're absolutely right.

944
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:15,450
我去找我助理  定個日子
Well, I'm going to go to my assistant, and we'll make a date.

945
01:09:16,530 --> 01:09:18,690
你太美了  我都沒認出你來
You look fantastic! I didn't recognise you.

946
01:09:18,690 --> 01:09:20,880
-你怎么來了  -回避政府特工
- What are you doing here? - Just avoiding government agents.

947
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,870
-你一個人來的嗎  -嗯  裙子哪來的
- Are you by yourself? - Yes. Where'd you get that dress?

948
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:24,480
-是生日禮物  -太棒了
- Oh, it was a birthday present. - That's great.

949
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:27,100
-你送的  -我的品位真棒
- From you, actually. - Well, I got great taste.

950
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:27,980
是啊
Yes.

951
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,360
-想跳舞嗎  -不
- You want to dance? - Oh, no.

952
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:32,010
-來嘛  -謝謝了  不
- All right, come on. - Thank you. No.

953
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:44,810
我讓你不舒服了嗎
Am I making you uncomfortable?

954
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:47,280
沒有
No. No.

955
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:49,930
我總忘記擦除臭劑
I always forget to wear deodorant

956
01:09:49,930 --> 01:09:53,000
還當著我所有同事的面穿一件露背裙子
and dance with my boss in front of everyone that I work with

957
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,710
跟我的老板跳舞
in a dress with no back.

958
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,990
-你很美  也很香  -天吶
- You look great and you smell great. - Oh, God.

959
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:00,020
但如果能讓你舒服點  我可以解雇你
But I could fire you if that would take the edge off.

960
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:03,520
我覺得沒了我你恐怕都不會系鞋帶了
I actually don't think that you could tie your shoes without me.

961
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:04,970
-我能撐一周  -是嗎
- I'd make it a week. - Really?

962
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:06,810
-絕對的  -你的社保號碼是多少
- Sure. - What's your Social Security number?

963
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:13,140
-五  -五
- Five. - Five?

964
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:15,320
-好吧  -嗯
- Right. - Right.

965
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:18,740
-你漏了幾位數字  -另外八個嗎
- You're missing just a couple of digits there. - The other eight?

966
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,460
另外八個有你嘛
So I got you for the other eight.

967
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,020
-出去透口氣吧  -嗯  我需要透口氣
- How about a little air? - Yes, I need some air.

968
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:40,410
-那感覺太怪了  -完全沒關系
- That was totally weird. - Totally harmless.

969
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:43,310
才不是沒關系
It was totally not harmless, by the way.

970
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:44,270
我們跳了支舞
We're dancing.

971
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:45,980
-都沒人看  -我的所有同事
- No one's even watching. - Everybody who I work with...

972
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:46,860
不是的  知道為什么嗎
No, you know why?

973
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:47,620
我覺得你不夠客觀
I think you lost objectivity.

974
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:49,110
我覺得他們就是...人而已
I think they just... People...

975
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:50,020
我們就是跳了個舞
We just danced.

976
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:51,220
不  不只是跳舞
No, it was not just a dance.

977
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:53,400
你不懂  因為你是你
You don't understand because you're you.

978
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,140
所有人都清楚你是什么樣的人
And everybody knows exactly who you are

979
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:57,960
你怎么對待女人什么的
and how you are with girls and all of that,

980
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,640
這沒什么關系
which is completely fine.

981
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:02,110
但我  你是我的老板
But, you know, then me, you're my boss,

982
01:11:02,110 --> 01:11:03,530
我跟你跳舞
and I'm dancing with you.

983
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:05,360
-我覺得沒人會那么想的  -這讓我顯得
- I don't think it was taken that way. - Because it makes me look like

984
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,910
好像在
the one who's trying to...

985
01:11:06,910 --> 01:11:09,100
-我覺得你想多了  -我們又來到這里
- I just think you're overstating it. - You know, and we're here,

986
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:12,890
我還穿著這件荒唐的
and then I'm wearing this ridiculous

987
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:15,800
裙子  我們還那樣跳舞
dress, and then we were dancing like that and...

988
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:32,790
-我想喝杯酒  謝謝  -好嘞
- I would like a drink, please. - Got it, okay.

989
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:36,940
-伏特加馬丁尼  謝謝  -好
- I would like a vodka martini, please. - Okay.

990
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:39,770
不加水  要很多橄欖
Very dry with olives, a lot of olives.

991
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:41,940
至少三顆
Like, at least three olives.

992
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:43,490
兩杯伏特加馬丁尼
Two vodka martinis,

993
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:45,700
不加水  多加橄欖  趕快
extra dry, extra olives, extra fast.

994
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:47,200
其中一杯加橄欖汁
Make one of them dirty, will you?

995
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:55,400
托尼·斯塔克
Tony Stark.

996
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,780
居然在這里見到了你
Fancy seeing you here.

997
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:02,980
-卡莉  -克莉絲汀
- Carrie. - Christine.

998
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:03,990
沒錯
That's right.

999
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:05,990
你今晚居然敢來
You have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight.

1000
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:08,210
你至少能給個反應嗎
Can I at least get a reaction from you?

1001
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:10,820
慌張  我認為我的反應是慌張
Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.

1002
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:12,060
我是指你公司與最近
'Cause I was referring to your company's

1003
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:13,580
一宗慘案的關系
involvement in this latest atrocity.

1004
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:15,030
是啊  他們向我發了邀請
Yeah. They just put my name on the invitation.

1005
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:16,240
我不知道能說什么
I don't know what to tell you.

1006
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,680
我真的差點相信了
I actually almost bought it, hook, line and sinker.

1007
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:20,790
我出門了幾個月  沒聽說嗎
I was out of town for a couple months, in case you didn't hear.

1008
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,800
這就是你所謂的負責任嗎
Is this what you call accountability?

1009
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:26,080
這里叫科米拉  聽說過嗎
It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?

1010
01:12:31,970 --> 01:12:34,020
斯塔克工業

1011
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:40,120
-這是什么時候拍的  -昨天
- When were these taken? - Yesterday.

1012
01:12:40,650 --> 01:12:42,860
-我沒有準許運輸  -你的公司準許了
- I didn't approve any shipment. - Well, your company did.

1013
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:44,340
我不是我的公司
Well, I'm not my company.

1014
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:48,570
-請回避一下  -你見過這些照片嗎
- Please, do you mind? - Have you seen these pictures?

1015
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,690
-科米拉發生了什么  -托尼
- What's going on in Gulmira? - Tony, Tony.

1016
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:52,480
你不能這么天真
You can't afford to be this naive.

1017
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,130
我曾經很天真
You know what? I was naive before,

1018
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:55,850
他們說  "這條線  我們不要越過
when they said, "Here's the line. We don't cross it.

1019
01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:57,490
我們就這么做生意"
This is how we do business."

1020
01:12:57,490 --> 01:13:00,730
如果我們暗地里做了兩面派  我們有嗎
If we're double-dealing under the table... Are we?

1021
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:02,610
托尼  拍張照吧
Tony, your picture, please!

1022
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,110
我們拍張照吧  來吧
Let's take a picture. Come on.

1023
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:09,150
拍照片了
Picture time!

1024
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:14,040
托尼  你以為是誰排擠了你
Tony. Who do you think locked you out?

1025
01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:17,420
是我提出了針對你的禁止令
I was the one who filed the injunction against you.

1026
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:21,950
只有這樣我才能保護你
It was the only way I could protect you.

1027
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:26,860
不
No. No.

1028
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:37,600
到達科米拉外圍的15英里路程
The 15-mile hike to the outskirts of Gulmira

1029
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,490
只能被形容為墮入地獄之路
can only be described as a descent into hell,

1030
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:42,850
進入當代的黑暗之心
into a modern day Heart of Darkness.

1031
01:13:42,850 --> 01:13:45,900
來自和平村莊的普通的農民和牧民
Simple farmers and herders from peaceful villages

1032
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:47,750
被迫離開家園
have been driven from their homes,

1033
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:49,870
被軍閥趕出了他們的土地
displaced from their lands by warlords

1034
01:13:49,870 --> 01:13:52,020
新得的力量為這些人壯了膽
emboldened by a new-found power.

1035
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,250
村民們被迫居住在
Villagers have been forced to take shelter

1036
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:56,520
其他村莊的廢墟中
in whatever crude dwellings they can find

1037
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,330
簡陋的遮蔽處里
in the ruins of other villages,

1038
01:13:58,330 --> 01:14:02,100
或是躲在這棟舊蘇聯冶煉廠遺址里
or here in the remnants of an old Soviet smelting plant.

1039
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:08,140
最近的暴力事件
Recent violence has been

1040
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:10,370
被歸咎于一群外國士兵
attributed to a group of foreign fighters

1041
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:13,380
他們被當地人稱為十戒組織
referred to by locals as the Ten Rings.

1042
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:16,790
可以看到  他們軍備齊全  而且目的明確
As you can see, these men are heavily armed and on a mission.

1043
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:18,150
任何妨礙了他們的人
A mission that could prove fatal

1044
01:14:18,150 --> 01:14:20,320
都可能因此喪命
to anyone who stands in their way.

1045
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:23,680
因為沒有政治干預或國際壓力
With no political will or international pressure,

1046
01:14:23,690 --> 01:14:26,310
這些難民希望渺茫
there's very little hope for these refugees.

1047
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:29,660
我身邊的一個女人  在焦急等待丈夫的消息
Around me, a woman begging for news on her husband,

1048
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:31,540
他被叛亂分子綁架了
who was kidnapped by insurgents,

1049
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:33,610
不知是被強迫加入他們的軍隊...
either forced to join their militia...

1050
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,920
焦急的難民抓著泛黃的照片
Desperate refugees clutch yellowed photographs,

1051
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,510
給任何愿意駐足的人看
holding them up to anyone who will stop.

1052
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:44,460
孩子簡單的問題  "我的媽媽爸爸在哪"
A child's simple question, "Where are my mother and father?"

1053
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:48,130
難民們希望渺茫
There's very little hope for these refugees,

1054
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:52,310
難民們只能想著  是否會有人來幫忙
refugees who can only wonder who, if anyone, will help.

1055
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:26,290
快點
Hurry it up.

1056
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:27,800
把女人趕上車
Put the women in the trucks.

1057
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:28,910
把武器存放在這里
Stack the weapons here.

1058
01:16:28,910 --> 01:16:29,930
把房子清空
Clear all the houses.

1059
01:16:29,930 --> 01:16:32,070
那個  快點
That one there. Faster. Faster.

1060
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:40,920
抓住那家伙
Grab that dog.

1061
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:45,690
把他跟其他人放在一起
Put him with the others.

1062
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:58,510
這怎么回事
What the hell is this?

1063
01:17:09,730 --> 01:17:11,110
打死這家伙
Shoot this dog.

1064
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,310
你們這群沒用的東西
You're all incompetent.

1065
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:17,920
腦袋轉過去
Turn your head.

1066
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:25,780
他交給你們了
He's all yours.

1067
01:19:24,990 --> 01:19:25,970
那是什么玩意  我們準許去那里了嗎
What the hell was that? Were we cleared to go in there?

1068
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:26,800
加州  愛德華茲空軍基地
那是什么玩意  我們準許去那里了嗎
What the hell was that? Were we cleared to go in there?

1069
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,020
沒有  長官  他們用了人肉盾
No, sir, they were using human shields.
加州  愛德華茲空軍基地

1070
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:29,140
我們沒獲得批準
We never got the green light.
加州  愛德華茲空軍基地

1071
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:29,270
給我接國務院  肯定是他們搞的
Put me through to State. They're going to be all over this.
加州  愛德華茲空軍基地

1072
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:30,750
給我接國務院  肯定是他們搞的
Put me through to State. They're going to be all over this.

1073
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:32,290
調出顯示
Get those monitors up!

1074
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:33,770
發現不明物體
We got a bogey!

1075
01:19:34,090 --> 01:19:36,350
-不是空軍  -接通中情局了嗎
- Wasn't Air Force! - We got the CIA on the line?

1076
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:38,480
我接通了蘭利  他們還問是不是我們
I've got Langley on the line. They want to know if it's us.

1077
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,110
絕對不是我們  長官
No, it definitely is not us, sir!

1078
01:19:40,110 --> 01:19:41,870
-不是海軍  -不是陸戰隊
- It wasn't Navy. - Wasn't Marines.

1079
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:44,700
我需要答案  能拿到目標圖像嗎
I need answers! Can I please get eyes on target?

1080
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:46,800
-不能  -無法識別
- Negative, negative. - Cannot identify.

1081
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,490
馬上把武器研發的羅德中校叫來
Get me Colonel Rhodes from Weapons Development down here now!

1082
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:57,150
我們查了身份
We ran an ID check

1083
01:19:57,150 --> 01:19:59,170
并交叉對比了所有已知數據庫
and cross-referenced with all known databases.

1084
01:19:59,170 --> 01:19:59,980
毫無發現
We have nothing.

1085
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:02,130
當地有高空監控嗎
Any high altitude surveillance in the region?

1086
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:03,950
當地有空中早期預警和全球鷹
We got an AWAC and a Global Hawk in the area.

1087
01:20:03,950 --> 01:20:05,630
這玩意是突然冒出來的嗎
So this thing just appeared out of nowhere?

1088
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:07,200
怎么會沒在雷達上發現
How come it didn't show up on the radar?

1089
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,190
只有很小的雷達截面  長官
Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.

1090
01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:11,530
-隱形的嗎  -不是  長官  它很小
- Is it stealth? - No, sir, it's tiny.

1091
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,590
應該是無人機
We think it's an unmanned aerial vehicle.

1092
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:15,700
中校  這是什么情況
Colonel, what are we dealing with here?

1093
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:20,830
-我去打個電話  -中士  清條線路
- Let me make a call. - Sergeant, clear a hole.

1094
01:20:24,910 --> 01:20:26,730
-喂  -托尼
- Hello? - Tony?

1095
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:28,620
-誰啊  -羅德
- Who's this? - It's Rhodes.

1096
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:30,880
-抱歉  誰  -我說是羅德
- Sorry, hello? - I said it's Rhodes.

1097
01:20:30,890 --> 01:20:33,600
-請大點聲  -那是什么噪音
- Speak up, please. - What in the hell is that noise?

1098
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,470
嗯  我敞篷開車呢
Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.

1099
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:37,360
我現在需要你幫忙
Yeah, well, I need your help right now.

1100
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,720
天道好輪回啊
It's funny how that works, huh?

1101
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:39,820
是啊  是這樣
Yeah. Speaking of funny,

1102
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:42,170
有個武器站剛被炸毀了
we've got a weapons depot that was just blown up

1103
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:44,010
離你當初被囚的地方只有幾公里
a few clicks from where you were being held captive.

1104
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:45,780
那里挺危險的
Well, that's a hot spot.

1105
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:48,220
似乎是有人插手替你完成了工作  是吧
Sounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you, huh?

1106
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:49,480
你為什么氣喘吁吁的  托尼
Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?

1107
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:50,730
我沒有  我在峽谷里慢跑呢
I'm not, I was justjogging in the canyon.

1108
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:52,630
-你不是在開車嗎  -是啊  我開車
- I thought you were driving. - Right, I was driving

1109
01:20:52,630 --> 01:20:54,430
到了峽谷  然后去慢跑
to the canyon, where I'm going to jog.

1110
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:55,630
你在那一帶真沒有什么
You sure you don't have any tech

1111
01:20:55,630 --> 01:20:57,010
我應該知道的東西嗎
in that area I should know about?

1112
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:58,640
-沒有  -發現不明物體了
- Nope! - Bogey spotted!

1113
01:20:58,640 --> 01:20:59,970
鞭子戰機  正在前往
Whiplash, come in hot.

1114
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:01,850
很好  因為我眼前就有個東西
Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one right now,

1115
01:21:01,850 --> 01:21:03,900
馬上要被炸飛了
and it's about to be blown to kingdom come.

1116
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:06,380
我該撤了
That's my exit.

1117
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:13,230
戰情室  這里是鞭子一號
Ballroom, this is Whiplash One.

1118
01:21:13,230 --> 01:21:14,930
我看到不明物體了
I've got the bogey in my sights.

1119
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,130
鞭子一號  那是什么玩意
Whiplash One, what is it?

1120
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:18,510
我不知道
I've got no idea.

1121
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:20,970
-能進行無線電聯絡嗎  -無反應  長官
- You have radio contact? - Non responsive, sir.

1122
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:22,600
那你可以交火
Then you are clear to engage.

1123
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:24,090
超音速飛行

1124
01:21:24,090 --> 01:21:24,960
啟動
Hit it.
超音速飛行

1125
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:25,090
啟動
Hit it.

1126
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,310
不明物體剛進入了超音速  我鎖定了
That bogey just went supersonic. I got a lock!

1127
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:39,470
-導彈來襲  -照明彈
- lnbound missile. - Flares!

1128
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:43,900
等等  不明物體調用了照明彈
Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!

1129
01:21:58,890 --> 01:21:59,960
展開襟翼
Deploy flaps!

1130
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:02,310
我去
Holy!

1131
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:04,180
那玩意從雷達上消失了  長官
That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.

1132
01:22:04,190 --> 01:22:05,830
衛星盯丟了
The sat visual has been lost.

1133
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:07,690
那絕不是無人機
No way that's a UAV.

1134
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:08,770
是什么
What is it?

1135
01:22:08,770 --> 01:22:10,200
我什么都看不到
I can't see anything.

1136
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,700
不管是什么  剛剛已經死了
Whatever it was, it just bought the farm.

1137
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:15,410
不明物體應該已經被處理掉了  長官
I think bogey's been handled, sir.

1138
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:27,240
-喂  -羅德  是我
- Hello? - Hi, Rhodey, it's me.

1139
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,070
-誰  -抱歉  確實是我
- It's who? - I'm sorry, it is me.

1140
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:30,410
你問了  你問的那個就是我
You asked. What you were asking about is me.

1141
01:22:30,410 --> 01:22:32,000
瞧  這不是游戲
No, see, this isn't a game.

1142
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,240
你不能把平民裝備飛入我的活動戰區
You do not send civilian equipment into my active war zone.

1143
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:37,460
-你懂不懂  -不是一件裝備
- You understand that? - This is not a piece of equipment.

1144
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:40,100
我在里面呢  是件戰衣  那是我
I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!

1145
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:41,860
羅德  你查到什么了嗎
Rhodey, you got anything for me?

1146
01:22:43,730 --> 01:22:46,670
-標記位置  回基地  -收到  戰情室
- Mark your position and return to base. - Roger that, Ballroom.

1147
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:50,510
在你底下
On your belly!

1148
01:22:50,510 --> 01:22:52,610
像是個人
lt looks like a man!

1149
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:55,310
甩掉他  翻滾
Shake him off! Roll! Roll!

1150
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:04,870
我被打中了
I'm hit! I'm hit!

1151
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:06,520
確認  他被擊中了
It's confirmed. He has been hit.

1152
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,700
跳傘
Punch out! Punch out!

1153
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:21,280
鞭子一號墜機
Whiplash One down.

1154
01:23:21,450 --> 01:23:23,100
鞭子二號  看到降落傘了嗎
Whiplash Two, do you see a chute?

1155
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:25,370
沒有  沒有降落傘
Negative! No chute, no chute!

1156
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:32,330
我的降落傘卡住了
My chute's jammed!

1157
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:40,430
長官  我看到不明物體了
Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey.

1158
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:41,830
鞭子二號  再次出擊
Whiplash Two, reengage.

1159
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:43,650
如果能擊落  就擊落
If you get a clear shot, you take it.

1160
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:47,580
少校  我們都不知道那是什么
Major, we don't even know what we're shooting at.

1161
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:48,240
讓猛禽回來
Call off the Raptors.

1162
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:49,630
那玩意剛在合法禁飛區內
That thing just took out an F- 22

1163
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:51,080
擊落了一架F22
inside a legal no fly zone!

1164
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:53,770
鞭子二號  如果能擊落  就擊落
Whiplash Two, if you have a clear shot, take it!

1165
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:56,230
你又被鎖定了  進行躲避操作
You've been reengaged. Execute evasive manoeuvre.

1166
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:57,160
繼續飛
Keep going!

1167
01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:07,190
降落傘打開
Good chute! Good chute!

1168
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:17,660
-托尼  你還在嗎  -謝謝了
- Tony, you still there? - Hey, thanks.

1169
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:20,270
天吶  你個瘋子
Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch.

1170
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:23,060
你欠我架飛機  你知道吧
You owe me a plane. You know that, right?

1171
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:26,140
嚴格講  是他撞了我
Yeah, well, technically, he hit me.

1172
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:28,110
你要過來看看我在做什么嗎
Now are you going to come by and see what I'm working on?

1173
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:31,260
不要  我知道得越少越好
No, no, no, no, no, no, the less I know, the better.

1174
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:33,220
我要怎么跟媒體講
Now, what am I supposed to tell the press?

1175
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:35,800
演練  一般不都用這套屁話嗎
Training exercise. Isn't that the usual BS?

1176
01:24:35,810 --> 01:24:37,260
沒那么簡單
It's not that simple.

1177
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:40,270
昨天一架猛禽F22
An unfortunate training exercise

1178
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:43,380
在演練中不幸發生事故
involving an F-22 Raptor occurred yesterday.

1179
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:47,120
慶幸的是  飛行員并未受傷
I am pleased to report that the pilot was not injured.

1180
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:51,100
至于科米拉村莊意料之外的局勢反轉
As for the unexpected turn of events on the ground in Gulmira,

1181
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:54,960
是誰或是什么進行了干預  我們尚不清楚
it is still unclear who or what intervened,

1182
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,230
但我可以保證
but I can assure you that

1183
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:59,200
此事與美國政府無關
the United States government was not involved.

1184
01:25:04,150 --> 01:25:05,850
的確很貼身  先生
It is a tight fit, sir.

1185
01:25:07,030 --> 01:25:09,880
先生  您越是扭動  就會越疼
Sir, the more you struggle, the more this is going to hurt.

1186
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:11,620
溫柔點  這是我第一次
Be gentle. This is my first time.

1187
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:14,810
我設計它能脫下來的  所以
I designed this to come off, so...

1188
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:18,310
我真的應該能
I really should be able to...

1189
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:20,880
請盡量不要動  先生
Please, try not to move, sir.

1190
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,620
怎么回事啊
What's going on here?

1191
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:29,690
承認吧
Let's face it.

1192
01:25:29,690 --> 01:25:31,740
這不是你撞見我做的最糟糕的事
This is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.

1193
01:25:33,690 --> 01:25:35,250
那是彈孔嗎
Are those bullet holes?

1194
01:26:03,070 --> 01:26:04,050
歡迎
Welcome.

1195
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:09,450
托尼·斯塔克的贈禮
Compliments of Tony Stark.

1196
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:12,260
如果你當初按計劃殺了他
If you'd killed him when you were supposed to,

1197
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:13,860
也不會把臉燒掉了
you'd still have a face.

1198
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:16,560
你給我們點小錢殺一位王子
You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.

1199
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:18,160
帶我去看武器
Show me the weapon.

1200
01:26:19,570 --> 01:26:23,170
來吧  讓守衛留在外面
Come. Leave your guards outside.

1201
01:26:39,870 --> 01:26:42,080
他的逃脫帶來了意外的收獲
His escape bore unexpected fruit.

1202
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,890
他就是這么做到的
So this is how he did it.

1203
01:26:47,330 --> 01:26:49,400
這只是首次的粗糙的嘗試
This is only a first, crude effort.

1204
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:52,250
斯塔克已完善了他的設計
Stark has perfected his design.

1205
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:55,450
他制作了一件死亡杰作
He has made a masterpiece of death.

1206
01:26:55,830 --> 01:26:59,070
有十幾件這種戰衣的人  能統治亞洲
A man with a dozen of these can rule all of Asia.

1207
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:02,810
你夢想奪下斯塔克的王位
And you dream of Stark's throne.

1208
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:06,490
我們有共同的敵人
We have a common enemy.

1209
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,850
如果我們還在合作
If we are still in business,

1210
01:27:15,870 --> 01:27:17,930
我會把設計給你
I will give you these designs

1211
01:27:19,630 --> 01:27:20,690
當做禮物
as a gift.

1212
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:23,360
作為交換
And in turn,

1213
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:27,030
希望你能禮尚往來
I hope you'll repay me

1214
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:30,820
給我鋼鐵戰士
with a gift of iron soldiers.

1215
01:27:41,450 --> 01:27:44,320
這是你唯一會得到的禮物
This is the only gift you shall receive.

1216
01:27:47,390 --> 01:27:48,610
科技
Technology.

1217
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:53,720
在世界的這一帶一直是個致命弱點
It's always been your Achilles' heel in this part of the world.

1218
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:58,870
別擔心  只會持續15分鐘
Don't worry. It'll only last for 1 5 minutes.

1219
01:27:59,710 --> 01:28:01,700
這是你最不需要擔心的事了
That's the least of your problems.

1220
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:09,650
把裝甲和其余的裝箱帶走
Crate up the armour and the rest of it.

1221
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:13,580
好  我們做個了結吧
All right, let's finish up here.

1222
01:28:17,650 --> 01:28:20,610
讓方舟反應堆下的16區做好準備
Set up Sector 16 underneath the arc reactor,

1223
01:28:20,610 --> 01:28:22,680
我需要遮蔽這些數據
and I'm going to want this data masked.

1224
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:24,370
找來我們最好的工程師
Recruit our top engineers.

1225
01:28:24,370 --> 01:28:26,190
馬上給我造個原型機
I want a prototype right away.

1226
01:28:35,470 --> 01:28:37,340
你忙嗎  可以替我去辦件事嗎
You busy? You mind if I send you on an errand?

1227
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:39,620
我需要你去我辦公室
I need you to go to my office.

1228
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:41,480
黑入主機
You're going to hack into the mainframe

1229
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:43,370
拿到所有最近的運輸清單
and you're going to retrieve all the recent shipping manifests.

1230
01:28:43,370 --> 01:28:44,880
這是鎖定芯片
This is a lock chip.

1231
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:46,830
能讓你黑進去
This'll get you in.

1232
01:28:47,230 --> 01:28:48,870
大概是在執行文檔里
It's probably under Executive Files.

1233
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:50,700
要不  就是在幽靈驅動上
If not, they put it on a ghost drive,

1234
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:53,320
那樣的話  你就得查找標題數碼最小的
in which case you need to look for the lowest numeric heading.

1235
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:56,070
如果我拿回了信息
And what do you plan to do with this information

1236
01:28:56,070 --> 01:28:56,940
你打算怎么做呢
if I bring it back here?

1237
01:28:56,950 --> 01:28:57,990
還是那套
Same drill.

1238
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,040
他們在暗箱操作  我要阻止他們
They've been dealing under the table, and I'm going to stop them.

1239
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:03,120
我要找到我的武器  摧毀它們
I'm going to find my weapons and destroy them.

1240
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:04,960
托尼
Tony,

1241
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:09,500
你知道我愿幫你做任何事
you know that I would help you with anything,

1242
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:13,530
但如果你又要這么胡來  我就不能幫你
but I cannot help you if you're going to start all of this again.

1243
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:17,450
除了這個  別無其他  沒有藝術館開幕
There is nothing except this. There's no art opening.

1244
01:29:17,450 --> 01:29:20,890
或是慈善晚會  或是簽什么字
There is no benefit. There is nothing to sign.

1245
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:25,190
只有下一項任務  沒有別的
There is the next mission and nothing else.

1246
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:27,260
是嗎
Is that so?

1247
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:31,000
那我辭職
Well, then, I quit.

1248
01:29:34,130 --> 01:29:35,880
這么多年來  你一直在我身邊
You stood by my side all these years

1249
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:38,470
看著我收獲毀滅的利益
while I reaped the benefits of destruction.

1250
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,930
現在我想保護那些
And now that I'm trying to protect the people

1251
01:29:40,930 --> 01:29:42,820
因我而身陷危險的人  你卻要走人嗎
that I put in harm's way, you're going to walk out?

1252
01:29:42,820 --> 01:29:44,820
你會害死自己的  托尼
You're going to kill yourself, Tony.

1253
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:47,190
我不要助你一臂之力
I'm not going to be a part of it.

1254
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:48,820
我本不該活下來的
I shouldn't be alive,

1255
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:52,310
除非這有什么意義
unless it was for a reason.

1256
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,240
我沒瘋  派珀
I'm not crazy, Pepper.

1257
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:59,590
我就是終于知道  我該做什么了
I just finally know what I have to do.

1258
01:30:03,530 --> 01:30:06,610
我心里知道  這是對的
And I know in my heart that it's right.

1259
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:23,850
你也是我的一切了
You're all I have, too, you know.

1260
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,010
警告  安全漏洞

1261
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:17,260
準許訪問

1262
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:22,190
找到幽靈驅動

1263
01:31:32,990 --> 01:31:34,140
16區  讀取文檔

1264
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:35,790
16區
Sector 16?
16區  讀取文檔

1265
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:36,490
16區  讀取文檔

1266
01:31:37,210 --> 01:31:39,110
你在干什么  奧巴代亞
What are you up to, Obadiah?

1267
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:51,720
翻譯

1268
01:31:51,730 --> 01:31:54,580
你可沒說你付錢叫我們殺的目標
You did not tell us that the target you paid us to kill

1269
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:56,160
是了不起的托尼·斯塔克
was the great Tony Stark.

1270
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:56,980
-你可以看到  -天吶
- As you can see, - Oh, my God.

1271
01:31:56,980 --> 01:31:57,790
奧巴代亞·斯坦尼
Obadiah Stane...

1272
01:31:57,790 --> 01:32:00,660
你的欺騙和謊言會讓你付出高額代價
...your deception and lies will cost you dearly.

1273
01:32:00,670 --> 01:32:03,020
殺托尼·斯塔克的價錢剛剛漲了
The price to kill Tony Stark has just gone up.

1274
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:03,650
開始復制
殺托尼·斯塔克的價錢剛剛漲了
The price to kill Tony Stark has just gone up.

1275
01:32:03,650 --> 01:32:04,100
開始復制

1276
01:32:07,410 --> 01:32:12,230
那么  我們要怎么辦
So, what are we going to do about this?

1277
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:27,360
我理解你現在的處境  派珀
I know what you're going through, Pepper.

1278
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:38,540
托尼  他的東西總是好的  是吧
Tony. He always gets the good stuff, doesn't he?

1279
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:04,590
他回家時我好開心
I was so happy when he came home.

1280
01:33:04,590 --> 01:33:07,290
就好像他死而復生了
It was like we got him back from the dead.

1281
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,110
現在我意識到
Now I realise,

1282
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:18,150
托尼其實根本沒有回家來  是吧
well, Tony never really did come home, did he?

1283
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:22,540
他把自己的一部分留在了那個洞里
He left a part of himself in that cave.

1284
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:26,420
傷透了我的心
Breaks my heart.

1285
01:33:29,030 --> 01:33:33,460
他是個復雜的人
Well, he's a complicated person.

1286
01:33:35,660 --> 01:33:39,160
他經受了很多事  我覺得他會沒事的
He's been through a lot. I think he'll be all right.

1287
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:48,430
你真是個少見的女人
You are a very rare woman.

1288
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:53,030
托尼不知道自己多么幸運
Tony doesn't know how lucky he is.

1289
01:33:55,550 --> 01:33:57,660
謝謝你  謝謝
Thank you. Thanks.

1290
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:01,210
我得回去了
I'd better get back there.

1291
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:08,820
那是今天的報紙嗎
Is that today's paper?

1292
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:11,700
是啊
Yes.

1293
01:34:12,590 --> 01:34:13,640
能給我看看嗎
Do you mind?

1294
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:16,720
-沒問題  -填字謎
- Not at all. - Puzzle.

1295
01:34:16,780 --> 01:34:17,790
當然
Of course.

1296
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:22,370
保重
Take care.

1297
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:39,510
下載完成

1298
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:48,990
波茨小姐  我們預約好的
Ms Potts? We had an appointment.

1299
01:34:48,990 --> 01:34:49,770
你忘記了我們的約會嗎
Did you forget about our appointment?

1300
01:34:49,780 --> 01:34:51,360
沒有  就現在  跟我來
Nope, right now. Come with me.

1301
01:34:51,370 --> 01:34:52,320
-現在  -我們現在就談
- Right now? - We're going to have it right now.

1302
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,630
-對  跟我走  -好
- Yeah, walk with me. - Okay.

1303
01:34:55,470 --> 01:34:57,230
我要跟你好好談談  包你一輩子不忘
I'm going to give you the meeting of your life.

1304
01:34:57,230 --> 01:34:58,430
去你辦公室
Your office.

1305
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:01,070
我們一直在盡力而為
Yeah, we've been working our best to do it.

1306
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:05,580
當然  我們...我回頭打給你
Absolutely, we're... I'm going to have to call you back.

1307
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,240
斯坦尼先生
Mr Stane?

1308
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:09,550
先生  我們嘗試了您的要求
Sir, we've explored what you've asked us,

1309
01:35:09,550 --> 01:35:11,230
但似乎遇到了點小小障礙
and it seems as though there's a little hiccup.

1310
01:35:11,230 --> 01:35:13,020
-其實  -障礙
- Actually... - A hiccup?

1311
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:14,670
是的  為給戰衣供能
Yes, to power the suit,

1312
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:17,040
先生  那種科技尚不存在
sir, the technology actually doesn't exist.

1313
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,420
-所以  -等等  科技
- So it's... - Wait, wait, wait. The technology?

1314
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:23,360
威廉  這就是那個科技
William, here is the technology.

1315
01:35:24,340 --> 01:35:26,500
我只是叫你把它造小點
I've asked you to simply make it smaller.

1316
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:28,000
好  先生  我們也在努力嘗試
Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying to do,

1317
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,510
但老實說  這不可能
but honestly, it's impossible.

1318
01:35:30,510 --> 01:35:34,340
托尼·斯塔克在一個山洞里就造成了
Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave!

1319
01:35:35,310 --> 01:35:37,060
用的是一堆破爛
With a box of scraps!

1320
01:35:39,230 --> 01:35:42,540
對不起  我不是托尼·斯塔克
Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark.

1321
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:56,170
派珀·波茨來電

1322
01:35:58,540 --> 01:35:59,450
托尼
Tony?

1323
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:06,780
托尼  你在嗎  喂
Tony, are you there? Hello?

1324
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:08,520
呼吸
Breathe.

1325
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:12,370
放松
Easy, easy.

1326
01:36:14,380 --> 01:36:16,690
你記得這個吧
You remember this one, right?

1327
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,410
真可惜政府沒批準
It's a shame the government didn't approve it.

1328
01:36:20,410 --> 01:36:24,690
誘發短暫麻痹用途多廣泛啊
There's so many applications for causing short-term paralysis.

1329
01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:28,200
托尼
Tony.

1330
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:35,340
我找人殺你時
When I ordered the hit on you,

1331
01:36:37,770 --> 01:36:40,210
我還擔心
I worried that I was

1332
01:36:43,330 --> 01:36:45,510
我是殺了金鵝
killing the golden goose.

1333
01:36:46,690 --> 01:36:48,030
但是
But, you see,

1334
01:36:49,210 --> 01:36:50,400
那真是
it was just

1335
01:36:51,730 --> 01:36:54,250
命運  你偏偏活了下來
fate that you survived that.

1336
01:36:59,110 --> 01:37:03,460
你還要給出最后一枚金蛋
You had one last golden egg to give.

1337
01:37:07,230 --> 01:37:08,590
你真以為
Do you really think

1338
01:37:08,590 --> 01:37:12,750
你想了個點子  它就是你的了嗎
that just because you have an idea, it belongs to you?

1339
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:17,410
你父親
Your father,

1340
01:37:18,710 --> 01:37:21,560
他幫忙造了原子彈
he helped give us the atomic bomb.

1341
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:23,520
如果他像你這么自私
Now, what kind of world would it be today

1342
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:25,780
現在的世界會是什么樣啊
if he was as selfish as you?

1343
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:37,810
真是美麗
Oh, it's beautiful.

1344
01:37:40,530 --> 01:37:45,300
托尼  這是你的第九交響樂
Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony.
西方迷信
貝多芬創作完成第九交響樂后不久便離世
他之后的很多作曲家也都是如此

1345
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:49,530
真是杰作  看啊
What a masterpiece. Look at that.

1346
01:37:51,010 --> 01:37:52,530
這是你的遺產
This is your legacy.

1347
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:57,600
新一代的武器
A new generation of weapons

1348
01:37:58,750 --> 01:38:00,820
將有它作為心臟
with this at its heart.

1349
01:38:03,740 --> 01:38:07,580
這些武器會把世界拉回正軌
Weapons that will help steer the world back on course,

1350
01:38:07,580 --> 01:38:09,960
讓權力落在我們手中
put the balance of power in our hands.

1351
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:12,810
合適的手中
The right hands.

1352
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:21,130
真希望你能看到我的原型機
I wish you could see my prototype.

1353
01:38:22,090 --> 01:38:23,390
雖然不像
It's not as...

1354
01:38:25,110 --> 01:38:28,060
不像你的那個那么保守
Well, not as conservative as yours.

1355
01:38:29,950 --> 01:38:32,570
可惜你還把派珀卷了進來
Too bad you had to involve Pepper in this.

1356
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:35,420
我本來更想留她一命的
I would have preferred that she lived.

1357
01:38:48,850 --> 01:38:51,180
什么意思  他花錢雇人去殺托尼
What do you mean, he paid to have Tony killed?

1358
01:38:51,190 --> 01:38:53,810
派珀  慢點說  奧巴代亞為什么要
Pepper, slow down. Why would Obadiah...

1359
01:38:55,130 --> 01:38:56,430
好吧  托尼現在在哪
Okay, where's Tony now?

1360
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:58,200
我不知道  他不接電話
I don't know. He's not answering his phone.

1361
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:00,500
請你過去一趟  確保他沒事
Please go over there and make sure everything's okay.

1362
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:03,400
謝謝  羅德  我知道條近路
Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.

1363
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:10,520
乖
Good boy.

1364
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,470
托尼
Tony?

1365
01:40:54,290 --> 01:40:55,310
托尼
Tony!

1366
01:40:57,060 --> 01:40:58,080
托尼
Tony!

1367
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:01,410
托尼
Tony!

1368
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:05,170
托尼
Tony!

1369
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:09,730
托尼  你沒事吧
Tony! You okay?

1370
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:11,160
派珀呢
Where's Pepper?

1371
01:41:11,970 --> 01:41:13,870
她沒事  她身邊有五個特工呢
She's fine. She's with five agents.

1372
01:41:13,870 --> 01:41:15,430
他們要去逮捕奧巴代亞了
They're about to arrest Obadiah.

1373
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:17,690
那不夠
That's not going to be enough.

1374
01:41:42,260 --> 01:41:43,770
16區
Section 16.

1375
01:41:45,010 --> 01:41:46,620
16區
Section 16.

1376
01:41:47,390 --> 01:41:48,520
在那兒呢
There it is.

1377
01:41:57,250 --> 01:41:59,470
我的鑰匙沒用  打不開門
My key's not working. It's not opening the door.

1378
01:42:00,670 --> 01:42:02,100
那是什么  小裝置嗎
What's that? It's, like, a little device?

1379
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:03,880
能開鎖嗎
It's, like, a thing that's going to pick the lock?

1380
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:05,470
你最好退后幾步
You might want to take a few steps back.

1381
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:27,690
那真是我見過的最酷的東西
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

1382
01:42:27,690 --> 01:42:28,860
不賴吧
Not bad, huh?

1383
01:42:29,870 --> 01:42:30,740
我們來吧
Let's do it.

1384
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:39,150
還需要我做什么嗎
You need me to do anything else?

1385
01:42:40,150 --> 01:42:41,610
別讓人上天攪局
Keep the skies clear.

1386
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:48,120
我去
Damn!

1387
01:42:56,390 --> 01:42:57,820
下次吧  寶貝
Next time, baby.

1388
01:43:28,180 --> 01:43:31,710
看來你是對的  他是在造戰衣
Looks like you were right. He was building a suit.

1389
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:33,660
我以為會更大些呢
I thought it'd be bigger.

1390
01:44:19,150 --> 01:44:20,150
干掉他
Take him out!

1391
01:44:30,870 --> 01:44:33,110
你覺得馬克1號的胸膛電源能不能撐得住
How do you think the Mark I chest piece is going to hold up?

1392
01:44:33,110 --> 01:44:35,370
戰衣電力為48%  還在減少  先生
The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir.

1393
01:44:35,370 --> 01:44:38,370
這塊胸膛電源不是設計用來飛行的
That chest piece was never designed for sustained flight.

1394
01:44:38,370 --> 01:44:39,290
隨時通知我情況
Keep me posted.

1395
01:44:41,550 --> 01:44:42,430
派珀
Pepper!

1396
01:44:42,430 --> 01:44:44,300
托尼  你沒事吧
Tony! Tony, are you okay?

1397
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:45,460
我沒事  你怎么...
I'm fine. How are...

1398
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:47,580
-奧巴代亞  他瘋了  -我知道
- Obadiah, he's gone insane! - I know.

1399
01:44:47,580 --> 01:44:49,400
-你最好趕緊走  -他建了套戰衣
- Listen, you'd better get out of there. - He built a suit.

1400
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:50,870
快點  馬上走
Get out of there right now!

1401
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:04,490
你想去哪
Where do you think you're going?

1402
01:45:10,590 --> 01:45:13,300
我不再需要你的服務了
Your services are no longer required.

1403
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:15,460
斯坦尼
Stane!

1404
01:45:40,580 --> 01:45:42,320
我愛這套戰衣
I love this suit!

1405
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:45,680
-把他們放下  -附帶傷害  托尼
- Put them down! - Collateral damage, Tony.

1406
01:45:47,050 --> 01:45:48,680
向胸膛轉移能量
Divert power to chest RT.

1407
01:45:58,070 --> 01:46:00,020
能量僅剩19%
Power reduced to 19%.

1408
01:46:07,830 --> 01:46:08,860
女士
Lady!

1409
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:12,630
不不不
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1410
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:37,920
30年了  我一直捧著你
For 30 years, I've been holding you up!

1411
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:44,670
我從零建立起了這家公司
I built this company from nothing!

1412
01:46:46,990 --> 01:46:49,550
什么都別想妨礙我
Nothing is going to stand in my way.

1413
01:46:55,860 --> 01:46:58,630
你更別想
Least of all you!

1414
01:47:07,790 --> 01:47:11,510
厲害  你升級了你的盔甲
Impressive! You've upgraded your armour!

1415
01:47:11,540 --> 01:47:14,030
我自己也有升級
I've made some upgrades of my own!

1416
01:47:22,710 --> 01:47:24,750
先生  他的戰衣似乎能飛
Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.

1417
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:26,620
發現了  帶我飛到最高高度
Duly noted. Take me to maximum altitude.

1418
01:47:26,620 --> 01:47:28,020
現在只有15%的電力
With only 15% power,

1419
01:47:28,020 --> 01:47:28,950
達到這高度的可能性
the odds of reaching that...

1420
01:47:28,950 --> 01:47:30,990
我會算算數  照做
I know the math! Do it!

1421
01:47:39,410 --> 01:47:41,750
長官  你不會相信的  那玩意回來了
Sir, you're not going to believe this. That thing is back.

1422
01:47:41,750 --> 01:47:43,930
接艾倫少校  集結飛機
Get me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!

1423
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:50,160
不必了  各位  只是演練
Not necessary, people. Just a training exercise.

1424
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:51,370
是  長官
Yes, sir.

1425
01:47:59,270 --> 01:48:00,750
只剩13%的電力了  先生
Thirteen percent power, sir.

1426
01:48:00,750 --> 01:48:01,570
繼續爬升
Climb!

1427
01:48:05,370 --> 01:48:07,390
-11%  -繼續飛
- Eleven percent. - Keep going!

1428
01:48:14,120 --> 01:48:16,250
-電力為7%  -在屏幕上顯示就行
- Seven percent power. - Just leave it on the screen!

1429
01:48:16,250 --> 01:48:17,280
別說了
Stop telling me!

1430
01:48:27,610 --> 01:48:29,190
你的點子很棒  托尼
You had a great idea, Tony,

1431
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:32,090
但我的戰衣在各方面都更先進
but my suit is more advanced in every way!

1432
01:48:32,700 --> 01:48:34,460
你怎么解決結冰問題的
How'd you solve the icing problem?

1433
01:48:34,850 --> 01:48:36,170
什么結冰問題
Icing problem?

1434
01:48:38,590 --> 01:48:40,030
最好查看一下
Might want to look into it.

1435
01:48:52,540 --> 01:48:53,680
2%
Two percent.

1436
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,630
現在在使用緊急備用電力
We are now running on emergency backup power.

1437
01:49:10,530 --> 01:49:14,110
-波茨  -托尼  天吶  你沒事吧
- Potts! - Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?

1438
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:15,450
我快沒電了
I'm almost out of power.

1439
01:49:15,460 --> 01:49:17,760
我得脫掉戰衣  我就過去
I've got to get out of this thing. I'll be right there.

1440
01:49:18,290 --> 01:49:19,550
想得美
Nice try!

1441
01:49:32,610 --> 01:49:34,170
武器狀態
Weapons status?

1442
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:36,900
沖擊系統下線  導彈下線
Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.

1443
01:49:40,810 --> 01:49:41,810
燃燒彈
Flares!

1444
01:49:50,770 --> 01:49:52,990
真聰明  托尼
Very clever, Tony.

1445
01:49:58,190 --> 01:50:00,730
-波茨  -托尼
- Potts? - Tony!

1446
01:50:00,730 --> 01:50:01,310
這樣不行
This isn't working.

1447
01:50:01,310 --> 01:50:03,940
我們得過載反應堆  炸碎屋頂
We're going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof.

1448
01:50:04,190 --> 01:50:07,080
-你要怎么做到  -你來做
- Well, how are you going to do that? - You're going to do it.

1449
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:09,620
去中央控制臺  打開所有電路
Go to the central console, open up all the circuits.

1450
01:50:09,620 --> 01:50:10,920
等我撤離了屋頂  就告訴你
When I get clear of the roof, I'll let you know.

1451
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:13,320
你就按下主旁路按鈕
You're going to hit the master bypass button.

1452
01:50:13,910 --> 01:50:15,570
上面的一切都會被燒毀
It's going to fry everything up here.

1453
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:19,740
好  我這就進去
Okay. I'm going in now.

1454
01:50:19,750 --> 01:50:22,890
一定等我離開屋頂的  我給你爭取點時間
Make sure you wait till I clear the roof. I'll buy you some time.

1455
01:50:32,550 --> 01:50:34,000
這個看上去挺重要
This looks important!

1456
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:57,770
我一向不怎么喜歡這種玩意
I never had a taste for this sort of thing,

1457
01:50:58,200 --> 01:51:02,470
但我得承認  我非常喜歡這件戰衣
but I must admit, I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

1458
01:51:10,540 --> 01:51:13,020
你可算超常發揮了  托尼
You finally outdid yourself, Tony!

1459
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:17,600
你會讓你父親自豪的
You'd have made your father proud!

1460
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:24,640
準備好了  托尼  快離開屋頂
It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!

1461
01:51:44,540 --> 01:51:46,030
托尼
Tony!

1462
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:48,850
真是諷刺  托尼
How ironic, Tony!

1463
01:51:50,630 --> 01:51:52,730
你想讓世界上不再有武器
Trying to rid the world of weapons,

1464
01:51:53,330 --> 01:51:55,550
卻發明了最棒的武器
you gave it its best one ever!

1465
01:51:55,550 --> 01:51:57,870
-派珀  -現在
- Pepper! - And now

1466
01:51:59,580 --> 01:52:01,400
我要拿它殺了你
I'm going to kill you with it!

1467
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:08,620
-你扯掉了我的瞄準系統  -按按鈕
- You ripped out my targeting system! - Time to hit the button!

1468
01:52:08,620 --> 01:52:12,630
-你叫我別按的  -別動  你個小混蛋
- You told me not to! - Hold still, you little prick!

1469
01:52:14,490 --> 01:52:17,440
-動手吧  -你會死的
- Just do it! - You'll die!

1470
01:52:20,290 --> 01:52:21,640
按吧
Push it!

1471
01:53:19,150 --> 01:53:20,690
托尼
Tony!

1472
01:53:29,310 --> 01:53:29,390
各位都拿到了昨晚斯塔克工業
You've all received the official statement of

1473
01:53:29,390 --> 01:53:31,260
詹姆斯·羅德中校  斯塔克工業事件
各位都拿到了昨晚斯塔克工業
You've all received the official statement of

1474
01:53:31,260 --> 01:53:33,750
事件經過的官方報告
what occurred at Stark lndustries last night.
詹姆斯·羅德中校  斯塔克工業事件

1475
01:53:33,750 --> 01:53:34,240
詹姆斯·羅德中校  斯塔克工業事件

1476
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:36,040
有未經證實的報告稱
There have been unconfirmed reports
詹姆斯·羅德中校  斯塔克工業事件

1477
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:38,860
一件機器人原型機發生故障
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned
詹姆斯·羅德中校  斯塔克工業事件

1478
01:53:38,860 --> 01:53:41,110
導致方舟反應堆受損
and caused damage to the arc reactor.
詹姆斯·羅德中校  斯塔克工業事件

1479
01:53:41,110 --> 01:53:41,530
導致方舟反應堆受損
and caused damage to the arc reactor.

1480
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:42,320
幸好  托尼·斯塔克的一位私人保鏢
Fortunately, a member of Tony Stark's personal security staff...

1481
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:44,580
鋼鐵俠是誰
幸好  托尼·斯塔克的一位私人保鏢
Fortunately, a member of Tony Stark's personal security staff...

1482
01:53:44,580 --> 01:53:45,190
"鋼鐵俠"  挺上口  挺響亮的
"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy. It's got a nice ring to it.
鋼鐵俠是誰

1483
01:53:45,190 --> 01:53:46,530
"鋼鐵俠"  挺上口  挺響亮的
"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy. It's got a nice ring to it.

1484
01:53:46,530 --> 01:53:47,880
雖然并不準確
I mean, it's not technically accurate.

1485
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:50,260
戰衣是金鈦合金
The suit's a gold-titanium alloy,

1486
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:53,050
但這種意向呼之欲出
but it's kind of evocative, the imagery, anyway.

1487
01:53:53,060 --> 01:53:54,240
這是你的不在場證明
Here's your alibi.

1488
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:56,650
好
Okay.

1489
01:53:56,730 --> 01:53:58,960
-你在你的游艇上  -嗯
- You were on your yacht. - Yeah.

1490
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:01,150
我們有港口報告證明你整晚都在阿瓦隆
We have port papers that put you in Avalon all night,

1491
01:54:01,150 --> 01:54:03,090
還有你50位賓客的宣誓證詞
and sworn statements from 50 of your guests.

1492
01:54:03,090 --> 01:54:06,150
或許該說只有我和派珀
See, I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Pepper and me

1493
01:54:06,150 --> 01:54:08,030
單獨在島上
alone on the island.

1494
01:54:09,290 --> 01:54:10,640
-就是這樣的  -好吧
- That's what happened. - All right.

1495
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:12,210
照讀就行
Just read it, word for word.

1496
01:54:14,690 --> 01:54:16,140
上面沒提斯坦尼
There's nothing about Stane here.

1497
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:19,800
這已經處理好了  他去度假了
That's being handled. He's on vacation.

1498
01:54:20,350 --> 01:54:22,890
小型飛機的安全記錄很差
Small aircraft have such a poor safety record.

1499
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:25,580
但關于保鏢的那套掩護說辭呢
But what about the whole cover story that it's a bodyguard?

1500
01:54:25,580 --> 01:54:26,830
他是我的...這...
He's my... I mean, is that...

1501
01:54:26,830 --> 01:54:28,390
這太站不住腳了吧
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?

1502
01:54:28,530 --> 01:54:30,590
我不是第一次做這種事了  斯塔克先生
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr Stark.

1503
01:54:30,910 --> 01:54:32,070
按官方說辭念就行
Just stick to the official statement,

1504
01:54:32,070 --> 01:54:34,090
很快  這一切都會過去了
and soon, this will all be behind you.

1505
01:54:35,020 --> 01:54:37,490
你有90秒
You've got 90 seconds.

1506
01:54:40,150 --> 01:54:41,230
科爾森特工
Agent Coulson?

1507
01:54:42,490 --> 01:54:46,730
我想說  非常感謝你的一切幫助
I just wanted to say thank you very much for all of your help.

1508
01:54:47,060 --> 01:54:50,070
這是我們的職責  我們還會再聯系的
That's what we do. You'll be hearing from us.

1509
01:54:50,260 --> 01:54:53,460
-你們叫國土戰略  -喊我們神盾局就行
- From the Strategic Homeland... - Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

1510
01:54:54,070 --> 01:54:55,030
好
Right.

1511
01:54:56,170 --> 01:54:57,790
我們開始吧
Let's get this show on the road.

1512
01:54:57,790 --> 01:55:00,010
其實也沒那么糟
You know, it's actually not that bad.

1513
01:55:00,010 --> 01:55:01,710
就連我都不覺得自己像鋼鐵俠
Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.

1514
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:04,140
-你不是鋼鐵俠  -我是
- You're not Iron Man. - Am so.

1515
01:55:04,140 --> 01:55:06,170
-你不是  -好吧  隨你
- You're not. - All right, suit yourself.

1516
01:55:06,680 --> 01:55:08,160
如果我是鋼鐵俠
You know, if I were Iron Man,

1517
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:10,600
我會有個知道我真實身份的女友
I'd have this girlfriend who knew my true identity.

1518
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:11,440
而且她會很崩潰
She'd be a wreck,

1519
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:13,180
因為她會非常擔心我會不會送命
'cause she'd always be worrying that I was going to die,

1520
01:55:13,180 --> 01:55:15,770
但又為我的成就感到驕傲
yet so proud of the man I'd become.

1521
01:55:15,770 --> 01:55:20,290
她會非常矛盾  而這又讓她更加
She'd be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more

1522
01:55:21,420 --> 01:55:22,350
為我瘋狂了
crazy about me.

1523
01:55:22,350 --> 01:55:24,130
你難道就沒想過那晚的事嗎
Tell me you never think about that night.

1524
01:55:24,150 --> 01:55:25,690
-哪一晚  -你知道的
- What night? - You know.

1525
01:55:28,970 --> 01:55:30,140
你是說
Are you talking about

1526
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,170
我們一起跳舞的那晚嗎
the night that we danced

1527
01:55:32,170 --> 01:55:34,650
然后我們上了屋頂
and went up on the roof,

1528
01:55:36,330 --> 01:55:37,550
然后
and then

1529
01:55:38,770 --> 01:55:42,020
你去樓下拿酒
you went downstairs to get me a drink,

1530
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:45,740
然后就撇下了我一人
and you left me there, by myself?

1531
01:55:46,540 --> 01:55:48,240
你是說那晚嗎
Is that the night you're talking about?

1532
01:55:51,290 --> 01:55:52,420
我猜也是
Thought so.

1533
01:55:55,010 --> 01:55:55,910
沒有別的事了吧  斯塔克先生
Will that be all, Mr Stark?

1534
01:55:55,910 --> 01:55:58,870
是的  沒別的事了  波茨小姐
Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

1535
01:55:58,870 --> 01:56:02,470
現在  斯塔克先生準備了一份聲明
And now, Mr Stark has prepared a statement.

1536
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:05,600
他不會接受提問的  謝謝
He will not be taking any questions. Thank you.

1537
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:11,920
自我上次見大家過去好一陣了
Been a while since I was in front of you.

1538
01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:13,850
我這次還是照稿讀吧
I figure I'll stick to the cards this time.

1539
01:56:16,790 --> 01:56:17,730
有人猜測
There's been speculation

1540
01:56:17,730 --> 01:56:19,810
我卷入了之前發生在
that I was involved in the events that occurred

1541
01:56:19,810 --> 01:56:21,080
高速和屋頂上的事件
on the freeway and the rooftop...

1542
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:22,190
抱歉  斯塔克先生
I'm sorry, Mr Stark,

1543
01:56:22,190 --> 01:56:24,050
你真的指望我們相信
but do you honestly expect us to believe that

1544
01:56:24,050 --> 01:56:27,940
那是一個穿戰衣的保鏢  碰巧出現
that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared,

1545
01:56:27,940 --> 01:56:30,720
-盡管你...  -我知道情況讓人糊涂
- despite the fact that you... - I know that it's confusing.

1546
01:56:31,160 --> 01:56:33,800
質疑官方說辭是一回事
It is one thing to question the official story,

1547
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:36,140
但提出瘋狂指控  或暗示說
and another thing entirely to make wild accusations,

1548
01:56:36,140 --> 01:56:38,300
我是個超級英雄可是另一碼事了
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.

1549
01:56:38,300 --> 01:56:39,980
我可沒說你是超級英雄
I never said you were a superhero.

1550
01:56:39,980 --> 01:56:41,540
是嗎  那很好
Didn't? Well, good,

1551
01:56:41,540 --> 01:56:45,700
因為那是不著邊際  異想天開的
because that would be outlandish and fantastic.

1552
01:56:47,290 --> 01:56:50,940
我顯然不是做英雄的料
I'm just not the hero type. Clearly.

1553
01:56:51,110 --> 01:56:54,210
我有一堆性格缺陷
With this laundry list of character defects,

1554
01:56:54,210 --> 01:56:55,660
犯過那么多錯誤
all the mistakes I've made,

1555
01:56:55,660 --> 01:56:59,140
-還很公開  -照稿讀就行
- largely public. - Just stick to the cards, man.

1556
01:56:59,140 --> 01:57:01,050
好  好
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1557
01:57:02,910 --> 01:57:03,990
事實就是
The truth is

1558
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:11,960
我就是鋼鐵俠
I am Iron Man.

1559
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:16,370
賈維斯
Jarvis!

1560
02:05:16,680 --> 02:05:18,580
歡迎回家  先生
Welcome home, sir.

1561
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:23,890
"我就是鋼鐵俠"
"I am Iron Man."

1562
02:05:24,730 --> 02:05:27,460
你以為你是這世上唯一的超級英雄嗎
You think you're the only superhero in the world?

1563
02:05:27,690 --> 02:05:28,400
斯塔克先生
Mr Stark,

1564
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:30,820
你已經成為了更大的宇宙的一部分
you've become part of a bigger universe.

1565
02:05:30,860 --> 02:05:33,150
你只是現在還不知道
You just don't know it yet.

1566
02:05:33,260 --> 02:05:34,440
你是誰
Who the hell are you?

1567
02:05:35,340 --> 02:05:38,100
尼克·弗瑞  神盾局局長
Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1568
02:05:40,070 --> 02:05:42,700
我來跟你談談復仇者聯盟
I'm here to talk to you about the Avenger Initiative.
