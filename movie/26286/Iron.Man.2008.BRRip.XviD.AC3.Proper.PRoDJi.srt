1
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,760
I feel like you're driving me to
court martial. This is crazy.

2
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:28,561
What did I do? I feel like you're
gonna pull over and snuff me.

3
00:01:28,762 --> 00:01:31,042
What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forest...

4
00:01:31,202 --> 00:01:34,082
- We can talk, sir.
- Oh, I see. So it's personal?

5
00:01:34,243 --> 00:01:35,763
No, you intimidate them.

6
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:38,763
Dear God, you're a woman!
I honestly, I couldn't have called that.

7
00:01:38,924 --> 00:01:41,404
I mean, I would apologize, but isn't
that what we're going for here?

8
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:43,885
I thought of you as a soldier first.
- I'm an airman.

9
00:01:44,086 --> 00:01:46,966
Well you have actually excellent
bone structure there. I'm kinda...

10
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:49,847
having a hard time not looking
at you now. Is that weird?

11
00:01:50,047 --> 00:01:51,767
C'mon, it's OK, laugh. Hey!

12
00:01:51,968 --> 00:01:54,248
- Sir, I have a question to ask.
- Yes, please.

13
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:57,529
It is true you went 12-for-12 with
last year's Maxim cover models?

14
00:01:57,769 --> 00:01:59,289
That is an excellent question.

15
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,810
Yes and no. March and I
had a scheduling conflict,

16
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:05,211
but fortunately the Christmas
cover was twins. Anything else?

17
00:02:05,612 --> 00:02:07,252
You're kidding me
with a hand up, right?

18
00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:09,452
Is it cool if I take
a picture with you?

19
00:02:09,653 --> 00:02:11,253
Yes, it's very cool.

20
00:02:15,574 --> 00:02:17,694
I don't wanna see this
on your MySpace page.

21
00:02:17,895 --> 00:02:19,375
Please, no gang signs.

22
00:02:19,575 --> 00:02:21,015
No, throw it up, I'm kidding.

23
00:02:21,216 --> 00:02:24,096
Yeah, peace! I love peace.
I'd be outta job with peace.

24
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:27,977
C'mon! Just click it, don't change
the settings, just click it.

25
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,859
What's going on?

26
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,140
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

27
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:41,661
Lie down!

28
00:02:47,223 --> 00:02:48,663
Son of a bitch!

29
00:02:50,264 --> 00:02:52,984
- Wait, wait, give me a gun!
- Stay here!

30
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:10,965
Tony Stark.

31
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:16,606
Visionary. Genius.
American patriot.

32
00:04:17,327 --> 00:04:19,007
Even from an early age,

33
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,488
the son of legendary weapons
developer Howard Stark

34
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:24,609
quickly stole the spotlight
with his brilliant and unique mind.

35
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,730
At age four, he built
his first circuit board.

36
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,610
At age six, his first engine.

37
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:34,651
And at seventeen, he graduated
Summa Cum Laude from MIT.

38
00:04:35,412 --> 00:04:38,172
Then, the passing of a titan.

39
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:42,013
Howard Stark's life long friend
and ally Obadiah Stane,

40
00:04:42,214 --> 00:04:45,214
steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder.

41
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:48,415
Until at age 21,
the prodigal son returns,

42
00:04:48,576 --> 00:04:51,696
and is anointed the new CEO
of Stark Industries.

43
00:04:51,897 --> 00:04:54,817
With the keys to the kingdom,
Tony ushers in a new era

44
00:04:55,018 --> 00:04:57,618
for his father's legacy,
creating smarter weapons,

45
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:00,099
advanced robotics,
satellite targeting.

46
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:03,819
Today, Tony Stark has changed
the face of the weapons industry,

47
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,500
by ensuring freedom

48
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:09,421
and protecting America and
her interests around the globe.

49
00:05:17,304 --> 00:05:19,704
As liaison to Stark Industries,

50
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:23,665
I've had the unique privilege
of serving with a real patriot.

51
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:27,266
He is my friend and
he is my great mentor.

52
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:30,147
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my honor

53
00:05:30,347 --> 00:05:34,227
to present this year's Apogee
Award to Mr. Tony Stark!

54
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,790
Tony?

55
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,114
Thank you, Colonel.

56
00:05:56,795 --> 00:05:59,115
This is beautiful. Thank you.

57
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:02,195
Thank you all very much.
This is wonderful.

58
00:06:03,556 --> 00:06:06,076
Well, I'm not Tony Stark.

59
00:06:07,197 --> 00:06:09,117
But if I were Tony...

60
00:06:09,518 --> 00:06:12,398
...I would tell you
how honored I feel,

61
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:16,839
and what a joy it is to receive
this very prestigious award.

62
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,800
Tony, you know,
the best thing about Tony...

63
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:24,241
...is also the worst thing -
he's always working.

64
00:06:28,643 --> 00:06:30,043
C'mon!

65
00:06:32,364 --> 00:06:34,284
We should just stay
till the morning.

66
00:06:34,485 --> 00:06:37,765
- You are unbelievable!
- Oh, no. They roped you into this?

67
00:06:37,926 --> 00:06:40,446
Nobody roped me into anything.
But they told me...

68
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:43,087
that if I presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honored.

69
00:06:43,247 --> 00:06:45,367
Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you!

70
00:06:45,568 --> 00:06:48,288
That's great. So when do we do it?
One more round. - There you go.

71
00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:50,729
There it is. That was easy.
I'm so sorry. - Yeah, it's OK.

72
00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:53,209
Wow, would you look at that?
That's... that's something else.

73
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,890
I don't have any of those
swooping around. All right, ride!

74
00:06:57,371 --> 00:07:00,091
Give me a hand, will you?
OK, you too.

75
00:07:00,492 --> 00:07:02,612
I don't blow on man's hands.

76
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:05,053
There it is! It's the Lieutenant
Colonel Rhodes' roll, and...

77
00:07:05,253 --> 00:07:06,813
That's what happens.

78
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:09,094
Worse things have happened,
I think we're gonna be fine.

79
00:07:09,294 --> 00:07:10,934
Color me up, will you?
- This is where I exit.

80
00:07:11,135 --> 00:07:13,095
- Tomorrow don't be late.
- Yeah, you can count on it.

81
00:07:13,295 --> 00:07:14,735
- I'm serious.
- I know, I know.

82
00:07:14,896 --> 00:07:17,936
Render unto Caesar that which
is Caesar's. There you go.

83
00:07:22,378 --> 00:07:24,498
Mr. Stark! Excuse me!
Mr. Stark!

84
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:26,939
Christine Everheart,
Vanity Fair magazine.

85
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:28,699
Can I ask you a couple of
questions? - She's cute.

86
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,780
- She's alright? Hi.
- Hi.

87
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,540
Yeah. Okay, go.

88
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:35,501
You've been called the Da Vinci of
our time. What do you say to that?

89
00:07:35,662 --> 00:07:37,342
Absolutely ridiculous.
I don't paint.

90
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:40,422
And what do you say to your other
nickname, the Merchant of Death?

91
00:07:40,623 --> 00:07:44,103
That's not bad.
Let me guess... Berkeley?

92
00:07:44,304 --> 00:07:45,624
Brown, actually.

93
00:07:45,824 --> 00:07:47,544
Well, Ms. Brown.

94
00:07:47,745 --> 00:07:50,265
It's an imperfect world,
but it's the only one we've got.

95
00:07:50,466 --> 00:07:52,906
I guarantee you the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,

96
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,186
we'll start making bricks and
beams for baby hospitals.

97
00:07:55,387 --> 00:07:56,187
Rehearse that much?

98
00:07:56,347 --> 00:07:58,107
Every night in front of
the mirror before bedtime.

99
00:07:58,268 --> 00:08:00,268
- I can see that.
- I'd like to show you firsthand.

100
00:08:00,468 --> 00:08:02,428
All I want is the serious answer.

101
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:04,549
Okay, here is serious.
My old man had a philosophy:

102
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:07,189
"Peace means having a bigger
stick than the other guy."

103
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,350
That's a great line, coming
from a guy selling the sticks.

104
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:12,111
My father helped defeat Nazis.
He worked on the Manhattan Project.

105
00:08:12,312 --> 00:08:14,432
A lot of people, including
your professors at Brown,

106
00:08:14,632 --> 00:08:15,952
would call that being a hero.

107
00:08:16,153 --> 00:08:18,073
And a lot of people would
also call that war-profiteering.

108
00:08:18,273 --> 00:08:19,593
Tell me, do you plan to report

109
00:08:19,794 --> 00:08:22,194
on the millions we've saved by
advancing medical technology?

110
00:08:22,394 --> 00:08:24,754
Or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?

111
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:28,035
All those breakthroughs:
Military funding, honey.

112
00:08:28,436 --> 00:08:31,316
Wow, did you ever lose an hour
of sleep your whole life?

113
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,997
I'd be prepared to
lose a few with you.

114
00:08:46,561 --> 00:08:48,321
Good morning. It's 7 a.m.

115
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:51,801
The weather in Malibu is 72
degrees with scattered clouds.

116
00:08:52,002 --> 00:08:54,722
The surf conditions are fair
with waist to shoulder highlines,

117
00:08:54,883 --> 00:08:57,563
high tide will be at 10:52 a.m.

118
00:09:14,128 --> 00:09:17,208
Tony? Hey, Tony!

119
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,295
You are not authorized to
access this area. - Jesus!

120
00:09:41,496 --> 00:09:43,896
That's Jarvis, he runs the house.

121
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:46,417
I've got your clothes here, they've
been dry cleaned and pressed.

122
00:09:46,617 --> 00:09:48,537
And there's a car
waiting for you outside

123
00:09:48,738 --> 00:09:50,658
that will take you
anywhere you'd like to go.

124
00:09:51,018 --> 00:09:54,578
You must be the famous
Pepper Potts. - Indeed I am.

125
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,180
After all these years, Tony still
has you picking up the dry cleaning?

126
00:09:59,741 --> 00:10:02,661
I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires.

127
00:10:02,862 --> 00:10:06,462
Including occasionally taking out
the trash. Would that be all?

128
00:10:23,107 --> 00:10:24,827
Give me the exploded view.

129
00:10:25,028 --> 00:10:27,668
The compression in cylinder 3
appears to be low.

130
00:10:28,349 --> 00:10:30,069
Note that.

131
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,790
- L'll try again later...
- Please don't turn down my music.

132
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,150
L'll keep you posted.

133
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:38,351
You are supposed to be half way
around the world right now.

134
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:40,071
- How did she take it?
- Like a champ.

135
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:41,672
Might've tried to
hustle me out of here.

136
00:10:41,832 --> 00:10:43,592
Your flight was scheduled to
leave an hour and a half ago.

137
00:10:43,753 --> 00:10:45,513
That's funny... I thought with
it being my plane and all,

138
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:46,953
that it would just wait
for me to get there.

139
00:10:47,154 --> 00:10:49,474
I need to speak to you about couple of
things before I get you outta the door.

140
00:10:49,674 --> 00:10:52,154
I mean, doesn't it kind of defeat the
purpose of having your own plane

141
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:53,595
if it departs before you arrive?

142
00:10:53,796 --> 00:10:56,276
Larry called, he's got another
buyer for the Jackson Pollock

143
00:10:56,436 --> 00:10:58,516
in the wings, do you
want it, yes or no?

144
00:10:58,717 --> 00:11:01,117
Is it a good representation
of his Spring Period?

145
00:11:01,318 --> 00:11:03,638
No the "Springs" is actually the
neighborhood in East Hampton,

146
00:11:03,838 --> 00:11:06,318
where he lived and worked,
not "spring" like the season.

147
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,439
I think it's a fair example...

148
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,120
I think it's incredibly overpriced.

149
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,720
I need it. Buy it, store it.

150
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:16,921
Okay... the MIT
commencement speech.

151
00:11:17,122 --> 00:11:19,282
Is in June... please, don't
harangue me about that stuff.

152
00:11:19,483 --> 00:11:22,123
Well, they are haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes...

153
00:11:22,323 --> 00:11:24,883
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.

154
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:26,924
What are you trying to get rid
of me for? What, you got plans?

155
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,525
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- I don't like it when you have plans.

156
00:11:29,725 --> 00:11:31,645
I'm allowed to have
plans on my birthday.

157
00:11:31,846 --> 00:11:34,886
It's your birthday. - Yes.
- I knew that. Already?

158
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:38,127
Yeah, isn't that strange,
it's the same day as last year.

159
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:41,528
Well, get yourself something
nice from me. - I already did.

160
00:11:41,729 --> 00:11:43,849
- And?
- Oh, it was very nice.

161
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:47,649
Very tasteful.
Thank you, Mr. Stark.

162
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,410
You're welcome, Ms. Potts.

163
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:15,457
You're good! I thought
I've lost you back there.

164
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:17,578
You did, sir.

165
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:20,939
I took it across Mojave.
- Ah, I gotcha, I gotcha.

166
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:23,259
What's wrong with you?
- What?

167
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,980
Three hours! - I got caught
doing a piece for Vanity Fair.

168
00:12:26,181 --> 00:12:28,301
Three hours. For three hours,
you got me standing here.

169
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,061
I'm waiting on you now.
Lets go. C'mon.

170
00:12:31,262 --> 00:12:33,582
Wheels up! Rock and roll!

171
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:43,305
What're you reading?
- Nothing.

172
00:12:43,506 --> 00:12:45,666
C'mon, sourpatch,
don't be mad.

173
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:48,226
I told you I'm not mad,
I'm indifferent, okay?

174
00:12:48,427 --> 00:12:50,147
- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. Stark.

175
00:12:50,347 --> 00:12:52,107
- No need to apologize.
- I told him I was sorry but he...

176
00:12:52,308 --> 00:12:53,628
I'm just indifferent right now.

177
00:12:53,828 --> 00:12:56,188
You don't respect yourself,
so I know you don't respect me.

178
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:57,749
- I respect you.
- I'm just your babysitter,

179
00:12:57,949 --> 00:12:59,869
and so, when you need your
diaper changed, thank you...

180
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,110
let me know and l'll
get you a bottle, okay?

181
00:13:02,311 --> 00:13:04,671
Hey, heat up the sake, will you?
Thanks for reminding me.

182
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:07,271
I'm not talking... we're not drinking,
we're working right now.

183
00:13:07,472 --> 00:13:10,792
And you are constitutionally
incapable of being responsible.

184
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:12,553
It would be irresponsible
not to drink.

185
00:13:12,713 --> 00:13:14,473
I'm just talking about
the night cup. - Hot sake?

186
00:13:14,634 --> 00:13:15,954
- Yes, two please.
- No, just...

187
00:13:16,154 --> 00:13:18,074
I'm not drinking,
I don't want any.

188
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:20,995
That's what I'm talking about.
When I get up in the morning,

189
00:13:21,196 --> 00:13:23,996
and I'm putting on my uniform,
you know what I recognize?

190
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:27,917
I see in that mirror that every
person that's got this uniform

191
00:13:28,118 --> 00:13:31,278
will get my back! - Here we
go again. I'm not like you.

192
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:34,759
No, you don't have to be like me.
But you're more than... yes you are.

193
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,760
Will you excuse me,
I'm a little bit distracted here.

194
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,040
No, you can't be distracted
right now. Listen to me!

195
00:13:43,682 --> 00:13:46,602
BAGRAM AIR BASE,
AFGHANISTAN

196
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:56,565
General.

197
00:13:56,765 --> 00:13:58,205
Welcome, Mr. Stark.

198
00:13:58,686 --> 00:14:01,406
We look forward to your
weapons presentation.

199
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,487
Is it better to be feared
or respected?

200
00:14:05,688 --> 00:14:08,968
And I say, is it too much
to ask for both?

201
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:12,409
With that in mind, I humbly
present the crown jewel

202
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,290
of Stark Industries freedom line.
It's the first missile system

203
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:18,291
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.

204
00:14:18,611 --> 00:14:22,091
They say the best weapon is
one you never have to fire.

205
00:14:22,372 --> 00:14:24,172
I respectfully disagree.

206
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:28,093
I prefer the weapon you
only have to fire once.

207
00:14:28,294 --> 00:14:31,854
That's how dad did it,
that's how America does it...

208
00:14:32,055 --> 00:14:34,255
and it's worked out
pretty well so far.

209
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,016
Find an excuse to let
one of these off the chain,

210
00:14:37,217 --> 00:14:38,857
and I personally guarantee you

211
00:14:39,057 --> 00:14:42,137
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.

212
00:15:00,143 --> 00:15:03,743
For your consideration,
the Jericho.

213
00:15:14,787 --> 00:15:17,987
We throw one of these in with every
purchase of 500 million or more.

214
00:15:18,188 --> 00:15:19,628
To peace!

215
00:15:20,508 --> 00:15:22,308
- Tony.
- Obie, what are you doing up?

216
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:24,749
I couldn't sleep till I found out
how it went. How did it go?

217
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,070
Went great, looks like it's
gonna be an early Christmas.

218
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:30,190
Hey, way to go, my boy.
L'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

219
00:15:30,391 --> 00:15:32,271
Why aren't you wearing
those pyjamas I got you?

220
00:15:32,392 --> 00:15:33,912
Good night, Tony.

221
00:15:34,952 --> 00:15:36,072
Hey Tony!

222
00:15:36,273 --> 00:15:39,433
I'm sorry, this is the fun-vee.
The hum-drum-vee is back there.

223
00:15:39,754 --> 00:15:42,274
- Nice job.
- See you back at base.

224
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:48,412
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

225
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:25,822
What the hell did you do to me?

226
00:17:26,103 --> 00:17:28,063
What I did?

227
00:17:28,343 --> 00:17:30,263
What I did is to save your life.

228
00:17:30,464 --> 00:17:33,744
I removed all the shrapnel I could,
but there's a lot left,

229
00:17:33,905 --> 00:17:36,345
and it's headed into
your atrial septum.

230
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:38,265
Here, wanna see?

231
00:17:38,826 --> 00:17:41,506
I have a souvenir.
Take a look.

232
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,308
I've seen many wounds
like that in my village.

233
00:17:46,508 --> 00:17:48,428
We call them the walking dead.

234
00:17:48,829 --> 00:17:51,709
Because in takes about a week for
the balls to reach the vital organs.

235
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,750
- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet.

236
00:17:55,231 --> 00:17:57,191
Hooked up to a car battery.

237
00:17:57,351 --> 00:18:00,711
And it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.

238
00:18:08,114 --> 00:18:10,314
That's right. Smile!

239
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,235
We met once, you know.

240
00:18:13,435 --> 00:18:15,595
At the technical
conference in Bern.

241
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,516
- Don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.

242
00:18:18,837 --> 00:18:21,917
If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand,

243
00:18:22,118 --> 00:18:25,038
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.

244
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:26,999
Where are we?

245
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,360
Come on, stand up.
Stand up.

246
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,000
Do as I do.

247
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:35,201
C'mon, put your hands up.

248
00:18:37,202 --> 00:18:39,122
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?

249
00:18:39,323 --> 00:18:41,243
Do you understand me?
Do as I do.

250
00:19:00,728 --> 00:19:02,888
He says: "Welcome Tony Stark,

251
00:19:03,089 --> 00:19:06,569
the most famous mass murderer
in the history of America."

252
00:19:09,971 --> 00:19:11,451
He is honored.

253
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:16,092
He wants you to build a missile.

254
00:19:16,773 --> 00:19:19,293
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.

255
00:19:22,574 --> 00:19:24,174
This one.

256
00:19:28,536 --> 00:19:30,136
I refuse.

257
00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:40,899
Tony!

258
00:20:28,752 --> 00:20:31,232
He wants to know
what you think.

259
00:20:31,873 --> 00:20:34,273
I think he got a lot
of my weapons.

260
00:20:42,236 --> 00:20:46,316
He says they have everything you
need to build a Jericho missile.

261
00:20:46,637 --> 00:20:49,277
He wants you to make
the list of materials.

262
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:54,799
He says for you to start
working immediately,

263
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,400
and when you're done,
he will set you free.

264
00:21:01,081 --> 00:21:02,521
No, I won't.

265
00:21:02,722 --> 00:21:04,162
No, he won't.

266
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,925
I'm sure they're
looking for you, Stark.

267
00:21:19,206 --> 00:21:22,206
But they will never find
you in these mountains.

268
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:24,967
Look...

269
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:29,888
What you just saw...
that is your legacy, Stark.

270
00:21:31,449 --> 00:21:34,729
Your life's work in the
hands of those murderers.

271
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,090
Is that how you want to go out?

272
00:21:37,611 --> 00:21:42,411
Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?

273
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,173
Or are you going to do
something about it?

274
00:21:45,373 --> 00:21:48,253
Why should I do anything?
They're gonna kill me, you...

275
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:51,934
Either way, if they don't,
l'll probably be dead in a week.

276
00:21:53,175 --> 00:21:57,015
Well then... this is a very
important week for you, isn't it?

277
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,777
If this is gonna be my workstation,

278
00:22:01,978 --> 00:22:03,978
I want it well lit,
I want all of these tools.

279
00:22:04,178 --> 00:22:06,578
Welding gear, I don't care if it's
acetylene or propane.

280
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:08,619
I need a soldering station,
I need helmets,

281
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,660
I need goggles,
I would like a smelting cup.

282
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,100
I need two sets
of precision tools.

283
00:22:24,824 --> 00:22:26,664
How many languages do you speak?

284
00:22:26,865 --> 00:22:29,785
A lot. But apparently
not enough for this place.

285
00:22:29,985 --> 00:22:33,265
They speak Arabic,
Urdu, Dari, Pashto,

286
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:35,746
Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.

287
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,667
Who are these people?

288
00:22:37,868 --> 00:22:40,828
They are your loyal
customers, sir.

289
00:22:40,988 --> 00:22:43,708
They call themselves
The Ten Rings.

290
00:22:52,312 --> 00:22:54,272
You know, we might
be more productive

291
00:22:54,472 --> 00:22:57,352
if you include me in the
planning process? - Aha.

292
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:06,595
Okay. We don't need this.

293
00:23:08,556 --> 00:23:09,996
What is that?

294
00:23:11,437 --> 00:23:14,917
That's palladium, 0.15 grams.
We need at least 1.6,

295
00:23:15,118 --> 00:23:17,998
so why don't you go break
down the other eleven.

296
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,839
What are they doing?

297
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,960
Working.

298
00:23:33,563 --> 00:23:36,323
Careful. Careful, we only
get one shot at this.

299
00:23:36,644 --> 00:23:39,044
Relax, I've steady hands.

300
00:23:39,844 --> 00:23:42,324
Why do you think
you're still alive, huh?

301
00:23:48,287 --> 00:23:50,207
What do I call you?

302
00:23:50,487 --> 00:23:53,927
- My name is Yinsen.
- Yinsen... nice to meet you.

303
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:56,929
Nice to meet you too.

304
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:37,539
Wow, that doesn't look
like a Jericho missile.

305
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,500
That's because it is a
miniaturized Arc reactor.

306
00:24:41,221 --> 00:24:43,901
We got a big one powering
my factory at home.

307
00:24:44,102 --> 00:24:46,782
It should keep the shrapnel
out of my heart.

308
00:24:46,983 --> 00:24:48,703
But what could it generate?

309
00:24:48,903 --> 00:24:51,383
If my math is right,
and it always is...

310
00:24:51,584 --> 00:24:53,424
three gigajoules per second.

311
00:24:53,585 --> 00:24:57,105
That could run your heart
for the 50 lifetimes. - Yeah.

312
00:24:57,386 --> 00:24:59,586
Or something big for 50 minutes.

313
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:10,389
This is our ticket outta here.
- What is it?

314
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,590
'Flying the mountain' look.

315
00:25:20,192 --> 00:25:21,632
Impressive.

316
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:47,519
Shesh Besh.

317
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,560
Good roll.
Good roll.

318
00:25:51,961 --> 00:25:53,881
You still didn't tell me
where you're from.

319
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:56,481
I'm from a small
town called Gulmira.

320
00:25:56,682 --> 00:25:58,882
It's actually a nice place.

321
00:25:59,082 --> 00:26:01,482
- You got a family?
- Yes.

322
00:26:01,883 --> 00:26:05,003
And I will see them
when I leave here.

323
00:26:05,204 --> 00:26:07,124
And you, Stark?

324
00:26:10,406 --> 00:26:11,406
Nothing.

325
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:13,446
No.

326
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:18,727
So you're a man who has
everything... and nothing.

327
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,460
Doesn't look anything
like the photo.

328
00:27:05,661 --> 00:27:07,301
Maybe he modified it.

329
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:10,381
- The tail doesn't seem right.
- Well, too bad.

330
00:27:53,594 --> 00:27:55,074
Relax.

331
00:28:03,476 --> 00:28:08,436
The bow and arrow once was the
pinnacle of weapons technology.

332
00:28:10,718 --> 00:28:13,398
It allowed the great Genghis Khan

333
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,759
to rule from the Pacific
to the Ukraine.

334
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,600
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great.

335
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:25,161
And four times the size
of the Roman empire.

336
00:28:28,923 --> 00:28:30,843
But today,

337
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:34,444
whoever holds the latest
Stark weapons,

338
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:37,285
rules these lands.

339
00:28:39,326 --> 00:28:41,286
And soon...

340
00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:45,367
...it will be my turn.

341
00:28:57,691 --> 00:28:59,571
Why did you fail me?

342
00:29:00,052 --> 00:29:03,052
We're working on it.
Diligently.

343
00:29:03,453 --> 00:29:05,413
I spared your life.

344
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,414
Is this how you repay me?

345
00:29:09,975 --> 00:29:12,215
It's very complex.

346
00:29:12,615 --> 00:29:14,655
We're trying hard.

347
00:29:15,056 --> 00:29:16,776
On your knees.

348
00:29:20,617 --> 00:29:22,497
You think I'm an idiot?

349
00:29:22,858 --> 00:29:24,418
Tell me the truth.

350
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:26,779
We are working hard.

351
00:29:33,061 --> 00:29:34,741
Open your mouth.

352
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:37,821
- What does he want?
- You think I'm a fool?

353
00:29:41,503 --> 00:29:43,223
What is going on?

354
00:29:43,504 --> 00:29:45,664
Tell me the truth.

355
00:29:46,424 --> 00:29:48,824
We are working on Jericho.

356
00:29:50,386 --> 00:29:52,506
What do you want,
a delivery date?

357
00:29:59,588 --> 00:30:01,028
I need him.

358
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:05,189
He's a good assistant.

359
00:30:09,311 --> 00:30:11,231
You have till tomorrow...

360
00:30:11,551 --> 00:30:13,471
...to assemble my missile.

361
00:31:15,129 --> 00:31:16,529
- Okay?
- Yes.

362
00:31:16,729 --> 00:31:17,969
Can you move?

363
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,649
Say it again.

364
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,610
41 steps straight ahead,

365
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,890
then 16 steps, left from
the door, four to the right.

366
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,811
33 steps, turn right.

367
00:31:32,693 --> 00:31:34,413
Where is Stark?

368
00:31:34,614 --> 00:31:36,454
He was here a moment ago.

369
00:31:36,655 --> 00:31:37,975
Go find him!

370
00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:53,539
Yinsen!

371
00:31:53,739 --> 00:31:55,059
Yinsen!
Stark!

372
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,660
Say something.

373
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,700
He is speaking Hungarian,
I don't...

374
00:31:58,901 --> 00:32:00,621
- Speak Hungarian.
- Okay...

375
00:32:00,821 --> 00:32:02,421
What do you know?

376
00:32:24,468 --> 00:32:26,668
- How did that work?
- Oh my goodness.

377
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:28,628
- It worked all right.
- What do I do?

378
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:31,429
- Let me finish this.
- Finish last powering sequence.

379
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,710
Okay.

380
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,990
Now! Tell me, tell me!

381
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,750
F 11. Tell me when you
see a progress bar.

382
00:32:37,911 --> 00:32:39,591
It should be up right now.

383
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:41,712
Talk to me, tell me when
you see it. - I have it.

384
00:32:41,912 --> 00:32:43,152
- Press Ctrl + I.
- Got it.

385
00:32:43,353 --> 00:32:46,273
'Enter'. I, 'Enter'. Come over
here and button me up.

386
00:32:50,515 --> 00:32:52,515
They are coming!

387
00:32:52,715 --> 00:32:54,675
Doesn't need to look pretty,
just get it done.

388
00:32:54,876 --> 00:32:56,276
They are coming.

389
00:32:57,637 --> 00:33:00,277
Make sure that checkpoints are
clear before you follow me out, OK?

390
00:33:00,477 --> 00:33:01,877
We need more time.

391
00:33:02,838 --> 00:33:03,918
Okay.

392
00:33:04,598 --> 00:33:06,158
I'm gonna go
buy you some time.

393
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,679
Stick to the plan!

394
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,280
Stick to the plan!

395
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,040
Yinsen!

396
00:35:58,446 --> 00:36:00,406
- Yinsen!
- Watch out!

397
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,330
Stark.

398
00:36:17,571 --> 00:36:19,531
Come on. We gotta go.

399
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:23,292
Move with me. C'mon, we got
a plan, we need to stick to it.

400
00:36:23,493 --> 00:36:25,213
This was always the plan, Stark.

401
00:36:25,413 --> 00:36:28,293
Come on, you're going to
go see your family again.

402
00:36:28,934 --> 00:36:31,574
My family is dead.

403
00:36:31,735 --> 00:36:34,055
I'm going to see them now, Stark.

404
00:36:36,136 --> 00:36:38,376
It's okay.
It's okay.

405
00:36:39,417 --> 00:36:42,337
I want this.
I want this.

406
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,059
Thank you for saving me.

407
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,500
Don't waste it.
Don't waste your life.

408
00:37:32,672 --> 00:37:33,872
My turn.

409
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:14,459
Not bad.

410
00:40:07,714 --> 00:40:09,434
How was the fun-vee?

411
00:40:11,915 --> 00:40:14,555
Next time you ride with me, okay?

412
00:40:44,124 --> 00:40:46,044
Watch it coming up here.

413
00:40:47,525 --> 00:40:50,405
Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.

414
00:40:58,168 --> 00:40:59,608
Your eyes are red.

415
00:40:59,808 --> 00:41:01,528
Few tears for your
long lost boss?

416
00:41:01,729 --> 00:41:04,449
Tears of joy.
I hate job hunting.

417
00:41:04,649 --> 00:41:06,409
Yeah, vacation's over.

418
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,730
Where to, sir?

419
00:41:08,931 --> 00:41:11,411
Take us to the hospital, please.
- No. - No? Tony...

420
00:41:11,611 --> 00:41:14,131
- You have to go to the hospital.
- I don't have to do anything.

421
00:41:14,332 --> 00:41:16,852
I was in captivity for three months.
There are two things I want to do.

422
00:41:17,053 --> 00:41:19,173
I want an American cheeseburger...

423
00:41:19,613 --> 00:41:21,173
...and the other one...
- That's not going to happen.

424
00:41:21,374 --> 00:41:23,534
It's not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.

425
00:41:23,735 --> 00:41:25,695
Call for a press conference?
What on earth for?

426
00:41:25,895 --> 00:41:27,815
Yeah, Hogan, drive.
Cheeseburger first.

427
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:40,859
Look at this!

428
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,660
Tony!

429
00:41:45,861 --> 00:41:47,941
I thought you'll be
in a hospital.

430
00:41:48,741 --> 00:41:50,141
Look at you!

431
00:41:50,582 --> 00:41:52,542
Oh, burger, you had
to have a burger.

432
00:41:52,703 --> 00:41:54,183
Did you get me one of those?

433
00:41:54,383 --> 00:41:56,303
There was only one left,
I needed it.

434
00:41:58,344 --> 00:42:00,264
Hey, look who's here!

435
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:07,546
- Ms. Potts?
- Yes.

436
00:42:07,747 --> 00:42:09,187
May I speak with you
for a moment?

437
00:42:09,387 --> 00:42:12,147
I'm not part of the press conference,
but it's about to begin right now.

438
00:42:12,348 --> 00:42:14,508
I am not a reporter.
I'm agent Phil Coulson,

439
00:42:14,709 --> 00:42:16,589
with the Strategic
Homeland Intervention,

440
00:42:16,789 --> 00:42:18,509
Enforcement and
Logistics Division.

441
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:21,390
- That's quite a mouthful.
- I know. We're working on it.

442
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:25,430
We've been approached
already by the DOD, FBI, CIA...

443
00:42:25,631 --> 00:42:29,031
We are a separate division.
With a more specific focus.

444
00:42:29,232 --> 00:42:32,312
We need to debrief Mr. Stark about
the circumstances of his escape.

445
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,313
- L'll put something in a book,
shell I? - Thank you.

446
00:42:40,636 --> 00:42:43,236
Hey, would it be alright
if everyone sat down?

447
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:46,316
Will you sit down? That way
you can see me, and I can...

448
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,557
A little less formal...

449
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,839
What's up with the lovin'?

450
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,440
Don't look at me,
I don't know what he's up to.

451
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,160
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

452
00:43:00,361 --> 00:43:02,761
I never got to say
goodbye to dad.

453
00:43:02,962 --> 00:43:05,602
I never got to say
goodbye to my father.

454
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:11,043
There's questions that
I would've asked him.

455
00:43:11,244 --> 00:43:14,364
I would've asked him how he felt
about what his company did...

456
00:43:14,765 --> 00:43:17,605
...if he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.

457
00:43:18,566 --> 00:43:22,206
Or maybe he was every inch of a man
we all remember from the newsreels.

458
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:29,408
I saw young Americans killed...

459
00:43:29,769 --> 00:43:33,929
...by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.

460
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:38,210
And I saw that I had
become part of a system

461
00:43:38,451 --> 00:43:41,611
that is comfortable with
zero-accountability.

462
00:43:44,653 --> 00:43:46,413
What happened over there?

463
00:43:46,934 --> 00:43:48,654
I had my eyes opened.

464
00:43:48,814 --> 00:43:51,974
I came to realize that
I have more to offer

465
00:43:52,175 --> 00:43:55,095
this world than just making
things that blow up.

466
00:43:55,256 --> 00:43:58,416
And that is why, effective
immediately, I'm shutting down

467
00:43:58,617 --> 00:44:01,817
the weapons manufacturing
division of Stark International...

468
00:44:02,298 --> 00:44:04,618
...untill such a time,
as I can decide

469
00:44:04,819 --> 00:44:06,739
what the future of
this company will be,

470
00:44:06,939 --> 00:44:09,499
what direction it should take,
the one I'm comfortable with,

471
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:13,380
and is consistent with the highest
good of this country and the world.

472
00:44:14,661 --> 00:44:17,381
What we should
take away from this...

473
00:44:17,542 --> 00:44:19,462
...is that Tony's back!

474
00:44:19,863 --> 00:44:22,183
And he's healthier than ever.

475
00:44:22,503 --> 00:44:25,543
We are gonna have a little
internal discussion

476
00:44:25,744 --> 00:44:28,464
and we'll get back to
you with a follow-up.

477
00:44:30,025 --> 00:44:32,185
- Where is he?
- He's inside.

478
00:44:42,829 --> 00:44:45,109
That... that went well.

479
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:47,710
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?

480
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:49,790
Your head?
What about my head?

481
00:44:49,991 --> 00:44:53,111
What do you think the over-under
on a stock drop is gonna be?

482
00:44:53,312 --> 00:44:56,192
- Optimistically? 40 Points?
- At minimum.

483
00:44:57,793 --> 00:45:00,513
Tony, we're a
weapons manufacturer.

484
00:45:00,714 --> 00:45:03,274
Obie, I just... I don't want
the body count to be up...

485
00:45:03,475 --> 00:45:06,115
That's what we do. We're iron
mongers, we make weapons.

486
00:45:06,275 --> 00:45:08,035
My name is on facade
of the building.

487
00:45:08,196 --> 00:45:10,236
What we do keeps the world
from falling into chaos.

488
00:45:10,436 --> 00:45:12,036
Not based on what I saw.

489
00:45:12,557 --> 00:45:13,957
We're not doing a
good enough job.

490
00:45:14,157 --> 00:45:15,677
We can do better, we're
gonna do something else.

491
00:45:15,758 --> 00:45:18,518
Oh, like what? You want us
to make baby bottles?

492
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:22,479
I think we should take another
look into Arc Reactor technology.

493
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,120
Oh, come on. The Arc Reactor,
that's a publicity stunt!

494
00:45:26,321 --> 00:45:29,561
Tony, c'mon! We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!

495
00:45:29,762 --> 00:45:32,842
- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.

496
00:45:33,323 --> 00:45:36,643
The Arc was never cost-effective.
We knew that before we built it.

497
00:45:36,844 --> 00:45:39,484
Arc Reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

498
00:45:39,684 --> 00:45:41,564
- Maybe.
- Am I right?

499
00:45:41,565 --> 00:45:44,485
We haven't had a breakthrough
in that, in what... 30 years.

500
00:45:44,686 --> 00:45:46,566
That's what they say.

501
00:45:48,487 --> 00:45:50,207
Could you have a
lousier poker face?

502
00:45:50,407 --> 00:45:52,527
Just tell me, who told you?
- Never mind who told me.

503
00:45:52,728 --> 00:45:54,208
- Show me.
- Rhodey or Pepper.

504
00:45:54,368 --> 00:45:56,288
- I wanna see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.

505
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,372
It works.

506
00:46:14,014 --> 00:46:15,974
Listen to me, Tony.

507
00:46:16,334 --> 00:46:18,134
We are a team,
do you understand?

508
00:46:18,335 --> 00:46:20,735
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,

509
00:46:20,936 --> 00:46:22,496
like your father and I.

510
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:25,416
I'm sorry I didn't give you a
heads up, okay? But if I had...

511
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:29,057
Tony, no more of this
'ready - fire - aim' business.

512
00:46:29,258 --> 00:46:31,778
- Do you understand me?
- That was dad's line.

513
00:46:32,379 --> 00:46:34,219
You gotta let me handle this.

514
00:46:34,419 --> 00:46:36,699
We're gonna have to play whole
different kind of ball now.

515
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,620
We're gonna have to
take a lot of heat.

516
00:46:38,821 --> 00:46:41,781
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

517
00:46:42,061 --> 00:46:46,341
<i>Stark Industries. I've got one
recommendation. Ready, ready?</i>

518
00:46:46,983 --> 00:46:48,263
<i>Sell, sell, sell!</i>

519
00:46:48,463 --> 00:46:50,183
<i>Abandon ship!</i>

520
00:46:50,504 --> 00:46:53,304
<i>Does the 'Hindenburg'
ring any bells?</i>

521
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:58,665
<i>Let me show you the new
Stark Industries business plan!</i>

522
00:47:00,827 --> 00:47:04,507
<i>Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!</i>

523
00:47:05,188 --> 00:47:07,908
Pepper!
How big are your hands?

524
00:47:08,109 --> 00:47:10,509
- What?
- How big are your hands?

525
00:47:10,709 --> 00:47:13,429
- I don't understand why...
- Get down here. I need you.

526
00:47:20,352 --> 00:47:21,432
Hey!

527
00:47:23,233 --> 00:47:25,233
Let's see them.
Show me your hands.

528
00:47:25,473 --> 00:47:26,873
Let's see them.

529
00:47:27,194 --> 00:47:29,874
Oh, wow, they are small.
Very petite, indeed.

530
00:47:30,075 --> 00:47:32,395
I just need your
help for a sec.

531
00:47:33,155 --> 00:47:35,555
Oh my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

532
00:47:35,756 --> 00:47:37,876
It was, it is now an antique.

533
00:47:38,437 --> 00:47:41,277
This is what will be keeping me
alive for the foreseeable future.

534
00:47:41,478 --> 00:47:43,398
I was swapping it up
for an upgraded unit

535
00:47:43,598 --> 00:47:45,838
and I just ran into a
little... speed bump.

536
00:47:45,999 --> 00:47:47,479
Speed bump?
What's happening?

537
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:49,199
It's nothing,
it's just a little snag.

538
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,680
There's an exposed wire
under this device

539
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,480
and is contacting a socket wall

540
00:47:53,681 --> 00:47:55,601
and is causing a little
bit of a short circuit.

541
00:47:57,482 --> 00:47:58,722
What do you want me to do?

542
00:47:58,922 --> 00:48:01,282
Put that on the table over
there. That is irrelevant.

543
00:48:01,483 --> 00:48:02,883
I just want you to reach in...

544
00:48:03,084 --> 00:48:05,484
and you're just gonna
gently lift the wire out.

545
00:48:06,204 --> 00:48:07,444
Is it safe?

546
00:48:07,645 --> 00:48:09,405
Yeah, it should be fine.
It's just like an operation,

547
00:48:09,565 --> 00:48:11,005
you just don't let it
touch the socket wall.

548
00:48:11,206 --> 00:48:13,806
- What's Operation?
- It's just a game, never mind.

549
00:48:14,006 --> 00:48:17,486
- Just gently lift the wire.
- Okay. - Okay? Great.

550
00:48:19,488 --> 00:48:21,928
You know, I don't think
that I am qualified to do this.

551
00:48:22,129 --> 00:48:24,569
No, no, you're fine.
You're the most capable,

552
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:27,729
qualified and trustworthy
person I've ever met.

553
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:29,650
You're gonna do great.

554
00:48:30,411 --> 00:48:33,931
Is it too much of a problem to ask?
Cause I really need your help here.

555
00:48:40,534 --> 00:48:42,414
- Oh, there's pus!
- It's not pus.

556
00:48:42,614 --> 00:48:47,174
It's a plasmic discharge, it's from
the device, not from my body.

557
00:48:47,456 --> 00:48:49,456
- It smells!
- Yeah, it does.

558
00:48:50,096 --> 00:48:51,656
The copper wire.

559
00:48:51,857 --> 00:48:54,017
The copper wire, you got it?
- I got it.

560
00:48:54,217 --> 00:48:55,577
Now don't let it touch...

561
00:48:56,018 --> 00:48:58,898
...the sides, that's what I was
trying to tell you before.

562
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:01,019
Okay, now make sure that
when you pull it out,

563
00:49:01,179 --> 00:49:03,419
you don't pull out the magnet
and the end of it. That was it...

564
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:06,500
...that you just pulled out.
- Oh God. OK, what do I do?

565
00:49:06,741 --> 00:49:08,701
- Don't put it back in!
- What's wrong?

566
00:49:08,861 --> 00:49:10,901
Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac
arrest cause you yanked out...

567
00:49:11,102 --> 00:49:14,182
- What? I thought you said this
was safe! - We gotta hurry.

568
00:49:14,183 --> 00:49:16,543
Take this, you gotta switch,
real quick. - Okay, okay.

569
00:49:16,904 --> 00:49:20,944
Tony, it's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna make this okay.

570
00:49:22,185 --> 00:49:24,625
You gotta touch
that to base plate.

571
00:49:24,826 --> 00:49:26,546
And make sure you...

572
00:49:30,187 --> 00:49:31,507
Was that so hard?

573
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:34,028
That was fun, right?
I got it, I got it.

574
00:49:34,668 --> 00:49:35,628
Nice.

575
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:37,869
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.

576
00:49:38,069 --> 00:49:39,629
Are you okay?

577
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:43,030
Don't ever, ever...

578
00:49:43,191 --> 00:49:46,071
...ever ask me to do anything
like that ever again.

579
00:49:46,472 --> 00:49:48,792
I don't have anyone but you.

580
00:49:53,794 --> 00:49:55,154
Are we ready?

581
00:50:00,355 --> 00:50:02,435
What do you want me
to do with this?

582
00:50:02,836 --> 00:50:06,356
That? Destroy it.
Incinerate it.

583
00:50:07,718 --> 00:50:09,478
You don't wanna keep it?

584
00:50:09,638 --> 00:50:11,398
Pepper, I've been
called many things.

585
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,319
Nostalgic is not one of them.

586
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:17,319
- Would that be all, Mr. Stark?
- That would be all, Ms. Potts.

587
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,760
Hey butterfingers, come here.

588
00:50:19,921 --> 00:50:22,041
What's all this stuff doing
on top of my desk?

589
00:50:22,241 --> 00:50:24,641
That's my phone, that's
a picture of me and my dad...

590
00:50:24,842 --> 00:50:27,722
Right there. In garbage.
All that stuff.

591
00:50:33,725 --> 00:50:35,685
The future of air combat.

592
00:50:36,005 --> 00:50:38,045
Is it manned or unmanned?

593
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:42,046
I tell you, in my experience,
no unmanned aerial vehicle

594
00:50:42,207 --> 00:50:44,927
will ever trump
a pilot's instinct,

595
00:50:45,288 --> 00:50:48,208
his insight - that ability
to look into a situation

596
00:50:48,409 --> 00:50:51,209
beyond the obvious
and discern its outcome.

597
00:50:51,409 --> 00:50:52,929
Or pilot's judgement.

598
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:55,650
Colonel, it's... why not
a pilot without a plane?

599
00:50:55,851 --> 00:50:58,131
Look who fell outta the sky!
Mr. Tony Stark.

600
00:50:58,331 --> 00:50:59,771
Speaking about manned
or unmanned,

601
00:50:59,972 --> 00:51:01,492
you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong.

602
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:03,092
It's spring break,
just remember that.

603
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:06,573
Spring break 1987, that lovely
lady, what was his name?

604
00:51:06,774 --> 00:51:07,934
Was it Ivan?

605
00:51:08,134 --> 00:51:10,414
Don't do that, they'll believe it.
Don't do that.

606
00:51:10,615 --> 00:51:13,175
Give us a couple
of minutes, you guys.

607
00:51:16,376 --> 00:51:17,776
- I'm surprised.
- Why?

608
00:51:17,977 --> 00:51:20,417
I swear I didn't expect to see
you walking around so soon.

609
00:51:20,617 --> 00:51:22,497
I'm doing a little
better than walking.

610
00:51:22,698 --> 00:51:24,058
- Really?
- Yeah.

611
00:51:24,698 --> 00:51:26,978
Rhodey, I'm working
on something big.

612
00:51:27,219 --> 00:51:30,299
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be part of it.

613
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:34,460
You're about to make a whole lotta
people around here real happy,

614
00:51:34,621 --> 00:51:38,141
cause that little stunt at the
press conference, that was juicy.

615
00:51:38,742 --> 00:51:42,782
This is not for the military.
I'm not... it's different.

616
00:51:42,983 --> 00:51:45,663
What, are you humanitarian
now or something?

617
00:51:45,864 --> 00:51:47,504
I need you to listen to me.

618
00:51:47,705 --> 00:51:50,985
No, what you need is time
to get your mind right.

619
00:51:52,546 --> 00:51:54,226
I'm serious.

620
00:51:56,827 --> 00:51:58,707
It was nice seeing you, Tony.

621
00:51:58,908 --> 00:52:00,508
Thanks.

622
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:11,190
- Jarvis, are you up?
- For you sir, always.

623
00:52:11,511 --> 00:52:15,031
I'd like to open a new
project file, index as: Mark 2.

624
00:52:16,313 --> 00:52:19,553
Shell I store this on the Stark
Industries' central database?

625
00:52:20,194 --> 00:52:22,754
I don't know who to trust
right now. Till further notice,

626
00:52:22,914 --> 00:52:25,474
why don't we just keep everything
on my private server.

627
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:28,235
Working on a secret
project, are we, sir?

628
00:52:31,797 --> 00:52:34,317
I don't want this winding
up in the wrong hands.

629
00:52:36,718 --> 00:52:39,398
Maybe in mine it could
actually do some good.

630
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:21,730
Next.

631
00:53:22,691 --> 00:53:23,851
Up.

632
00:53:24,051 --> 00:53:26,691
Not the boot, Dummy, right here.
You got me?

633
00:53:26,892 --> 00:53:28,692
Stay put. Nice.

634
00:53:30,133 --> 00:53:32,893
And you, you're no better
at it at all. Lift... I got it.

635
00:53:34,574 --> 00:53:36,614
Okay, I'm sorry,
am I in your way?

636
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:44,096
Up.

637
00:53:45,057 --> 00:53:47,577
That's great, don't even move.

638
00:53:47,938 --> 00:53:50,378
You... are a tragedy.

639
00:53:59,501 --> 00:54:01,621
Okay, lets do this right.

640
00:54:02,261 --> 00:54:05,261
Start mark, half meter
back of the center.

641
00:54:07,783 --> 00:54:10,023
Dummy, look for light.
Stand back for fire safety.

642
00:54:10,184 --> 00:54:11,944
You, roll it.

643
00:54:16,105 --> 00:54:18,025
Activate hand controls.

644
00:54:21,267 --> 00:54:22,987
We are gonna start up
nice and easy,

645
00:54:23,187 --> 00:54:25,307
raising 10% thrust capacity
to achieve lift.

646
00:54:25,788 --> 00:54:29,628
And 3, 2, 1.

647
00:55:06,359 --> 00:55:08,519
Up two? Alright, step back.

648
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,760
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?

649
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,480
Yeah, everything's... what?

650
00:55:12,681 --> 00:55:15,521
- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great, l'll be right up.

651
00:55:18,002 --> 00:55:20,082
I thought you said you were
done making weapons?

652
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:23,003
It isn't. This is
a flight stabilizer.

653
00:55:23,204 --> 00:55:25,004
It's completely harmless.

654
00:55:28,805 --> 00:55:30,565
I didn't expect that.

655
00:55:35,007 --> 00:55:36,567
How'd it go?

656
00:55:38,528 --> 00:55:40,408
Oh, went that bad huh?

657
00:55:40,608 --> 00:55:43,088
Just because I brought
pizza back from New York

658
00:55:43,289 --> 00:55:46,369
doesn't mean it went bad.
- Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

659
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:48,810
It would've gone better
if you were there.

660
00:55:49,731 --> 00:55:52,011
You told me to lay low and
that's what I've been doing.

661
00:55:52,211 --> 00:55:53,771
I lay low and you
take care of all the...

662
00:55:53,972 --> 00:55:55,892
Hey, c'mon.
In public, the press...

663
00:55:56,413 --> 00:55:58,573
This was a Board of
Directors meeting.

664
00:55:58,773 --> 00:56:01,133
This was a Board of
Directors meeting?

665
00:56:02,014 --> 00:56:03,854
The Board is claiming
a Post Traumatic Stress.

666
00:56:04,055 --> 00:56:06,055
They are filing an injunction.
- A what?

667
00:56:06,255 --> 00:56:07,575
They wanna lock you out.

668
00:56:07,776 --> 00:56:09,736
Why, cause the stocks dip 40 points?
We knew this was gonna happen.

669
00:56:09,936 --> 00:56:11,856
- 56 and a half.
- It doesn't matter.

670
00:56:12,017 --> 00:56:14,057
We own a controlling
interest in the company.

671
00:56:14,257 --> 00:56:16,697
Tony, the Board has rights too.

672
00:56:17,218 --> 00:56:20,658
They are making the case that
you and your new direction

673
00:56:20,859 --> 00:56:22,619
isn't in a company's
best interest.

674
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,820
I'm being responsible.
That's a new direction.

675
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,780
For me... for the company.

676
00:56:26,941 --> 00:56:30,621
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...

677
00:56:30,942 --> 00:56:34,102
- Oh, this is great!
- Oh c'mon, wait! Tony, Tony!

678
00:56:34,383 --> 00:56:37,263
- L'll be in the shop.
- Hey, hey, Tony, listen.

679
00:56:37,544 --> 00:56:39,464
I'm trying to turn
this thing around,

680
00:56:39,664 --> 00:56:42,504
but you gotta give me something.
Something to pitch them.

681
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:45,145
Let me have the engineers
analyze that, you know,

682
00:56:45,346 --> 00:56:47,066
draw some specs.
- No.

683
00:56:47,266 --> 00:56:49,226
No. Absolutely not.
This one stays with me.

684
00:56:49,387 --> 00:56:51,067
That's it Obie.
Forget it.

685
00:56:51,268 --> 00:56:52,628
Alright, well this
stays with me then.

686
00:56:52,828 --> 00:56:55,508
Go on, here, you can have
a piece. Take two. - Thank you.

687
00:56:55,709 --> 00:56:58,029
Do you mind if I come down there
to see what you're doing?

688
00:56:58,229 --> 00:56:59,549
Good night, Obie.

689
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:02,870
Day 11, Test 37,
Configuration 2.0.

690
00:57:03,071 --> 00:57:05,791
For lack of a better option,
Dummy is still on fire safety.

691
00:57:05,992 --> 00:57:08,512
If you douse me again,
and I'm not on fire,

692
00:57:08,712 --> 00:57:11,512
I'm donating you to a city college.
Alright, nice and easy.

693
00:57:11,793 --> 00:57:16,233
Seriously, just gonna start off
with 1% thrust capacity.

694
00:57:17,955 --> 00:57:19,675
And 3, 2, 1.

695
00:57:33,799 --> 00:57:35,759
Please don't follow me around
with it either cause I feel

696
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,280
like I'm going to catch on fire
spontaneously. Just stand down.

697
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,080
If something happens,
then come in.

698
00:57:40,241 --> 00:57:43,321
Again, lets bring it up to 2.5%.
3, 2, 1...

699
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:01,006
Okay, this is where
I don't want to be.

700
00:58:01,727 --> 00:58:03,527
Not the car,
not the car.

701
00:58:15,811 --> 00:58:17,731
It could be worse.
We are fine.

702
00:58:19,692 --> 00:58:21,732
Okay, we are getting there.

703
00:58:40,497 --> 00:58:42,417
Yeah. I can fly.

704
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:48,939
- Jarvis, are you there?
- At your service, sir.

705
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:51,620
Engage head up display.
Check.

706
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,140
Import all preferences
from home interface.

707
00:58:54,301 --> 00:58:55,661
Will do, sir.

708
00:59:01,463 --> 00:59:03,343
Alright, what do you say?

709
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:06,024
I have indeed been uploaded,
sir. We're online and ready.

710
00:59:06,224 --> 00:59:07,984
Start the virtual walkaround.

711
00:59:08,185 --> 00:59:10,865
Importing preferences and
calibrating virtual environment.

712
00:59:11,066 --> 00:59:13,826
- Do a check on control surfaces.
- As you wish.

713
00:59:34,672 --> 00:59:37,752
Test complete. Preparing to
power down and begin diagnostics.

714
00:59:37,913 --> 00:59:40,273
Ah, yes... tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.

715
00:59:40,474 --> 00:59:41,914
Start listening
the ground control.

716
00:59:42,074 --> 00:59:44,514
Sir, there are still terabytes
of calculations needed

717
00:59:44,715 --> 00:59:46,595
before an actual flight.
- Jarvis...

718
00:59:46,795 --> 00:59:49,315
Sometimes you gotta run
before you can walk.

719
00:59:49,476 --> 00:59:53,156
Ready? And 3, 2, 1.

720
01:00:15,817 --> 01:00:17,217
It feels like a dream.

721
01:00:44,577 --> 01:00:45,977
Alright, lets see what
this thing can do.

722
01:00:46,204 --> 01:00:47,704
What's the SR-71's record?

723
01:00:47,939 --> 01:00:50,945
The altitude record for fixed-wing
flight is 85.000 feet, sir.

724
01:00:51,254 --> 01:00:53,590
Records are made
to be broken. C'mon!

725
01:00:57,095 --> 01:01:00,432
Sir, there is a potentially fatal
build-up of ice occurring.

726
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:01,976
Keep going!

727
01:01:03,352 --> 01:01:04,812
Higher!

728
01:01:18,453 --> 01:01:20,830
We're iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps.

729
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:22,958
Jarvis?

730
01:01:24,878 --> 01:01:27,005
C'mon, we gotta break the ice!

731
01:01:59,927 --> 01:02:01,303
Cut power.

732
01:03:22,066 --> 01:03:25,361
Note: Main transducer feels
sluggish at plus 40 altitude.

733
01:03:25,528 --> 01:03:27,447
The whole pressurization
is problematic.

734
01:03:27,656 --> 01:03:29,783
I'm thinking 'icy' is
a probable factor.

735
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:32,744
A very astute observation, sir.
Perhaps if you intend to visit

736
01:03:32,912 --> 01:03:34,997
other planets, we should
improve the exo systems.

737
01:03:35,207 --> 01:03:37,626
Connect to the Cisco, have it
reconfigure the shell metals.

738
01:03:37,834 --> 01:03:40,545
Use the gold-titanium alloy from
the Seraphim tactical satellite.

739
01:03:40,755 --> 01:03:42,840
That should ensure
the fuselage integrity

740
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:45,176
while maintaining power
- to-weight ratio. Got it?

741
01:03:45,343 --> 01:03:48,054
Yes. Shall I render using
proposed specifications?

742
01:03:48,264 --> 01:03:49,682
Thrill me.

743
01:03:50,809 --> 01:03:52,727
<i>Tonight's red hot,
red carpeted,</i>

744
01:03:52,727 --> 01:03:54,812
<i>right here at the
Disney Concert Hall,</i>

745
01:03:55,022 --> 01:03:57,691
<i>where Tony Stark's
third annual benefit for</i>

746
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,778
<i>the Firefighters Family Fund
has become the place to be...</i>

747
01:04:01,029 --> 01:04:02,698
Jarvis, did we get
an invite from them?

748
01:04:02,864 --> 01:04:05,158
I have no record of
the invitation, sir.

749
01:04:05,576 --> 01:04:07,369
<i>... haven't been seen in public</i>

750
01:04:07,537 --> 01:04:10,373
<i>since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.</i>

751
01:04:10,582 --> 01:04:13,084
<i>Some claim he's suffering
from PTS and has been</i>

752
01:04:13,294 --> 01:04:15,879
<i>bed ridden for weeks.
Whatever the case may be,</i>

753
01:04:16,047 --> 01:04:18,925
<i>no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.</i>

754
01:04:19,343 --> 01:04:20,719
The render is complete.

755
01:04:21,219 --> 01:04:23,180
Little ostentatious,
don't you think?

756
01:04:23,389 --> 01:04:26,308
What was I thinking?
You're usually so discrete.

757
01:04:27,561 --> 01:04:30,355
Tell you what... throw a little
hot rot red in there.

758
01:04:30,523 --> 01:04:32,858
Yes, that shall help you
keep a low profile.

759
01:04:36,154 --> 01:04:38,072
The render is complete.

760
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:40,325
Yeah, I like it.
Fabricate it and paint it.

761
01:04:40,493 --> 01:04:42,078
Commencing an
automated assembly.

762
01:04:42,286 --> 01:04:44,413
Estimated completion
time is five hours.

763
01:04:44,957 --> 01:04:46,917
Don't wait up for me, honey.

764
01:05:09,235 --> 01:05:10,945
The weapons manufacturing is...

765
01:05:11,154 --> 01:05:14,407
only a one small part of what
Stark Industries is all about...

766
01:05:19,289 --> 01:05:22,041
- Hey Tony, remember me?
- I sure don't.

767
01:05:23,001 --> 01:05:24,753
You look great, Hef.

768
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:30,885
What's the world coming to when
a guy's gotta crash his own party?

769
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:32,929
Look at you!

770
01:05:34,056 --> 01:05:36,642
- Hey, what a surprise!
- L'll see you inside.

771
01:05:38,603 --> 01:05:40,521
Listen, take it slow, alright?

772
01:05:40,689 --> 01:05:42,733
I got the Board where
I really want them.

773
01:05:42,942 --> 01:05:45,528
You got it. Just cabin fever,
l'll just be a minute.

774
01:05:50,075 --> 01:05:52,118
Give me a Scotch,
I'm starving.

775
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:54,997
- Mr. Stark?
- Yeah?

776
01:05:55,248 --> 01:05:58,126
- Agent Coulson.
- Oh yeah, the guy from the...

777
01:05:58,377 --> 01:06:00,004
Strategic Homeland
Intervention

778
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:02,089
Enforcement and
Logistics Division.

779
01:06:02,215 --> 01:06:04,050
God, you got... you need
a new name for that.

780
01:06:04,217 --> 01:06:05,760
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

781
01:06:06,178 --> 01:06:08,305
Listen, I know this must be
a trying time for you,

782
01:06:08,514 --> 01:06:10,016
but we need to debrief you.

783
01:06:10,224 --> 01:06:12,143
There's still a lot of
unanswered questions,

784
01:06:12,352 --> 01:06:14,062
and time can be a factor
with these things.

785
01:06:14,271 --> 01:06:15,981
Lets just put something
on the books.

786
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:19,068
How about the 24th, at 7 p.m.
At Stark Industries?

787
01:06:19,736 --> 01:06:22,655
Tell you what... you got it.
You're absolutely right.

788
01:06:22,947 --> 01:06:26,993
Well... I'm gonna go to my
assistant and we'll make it date.

789
01:06:28,538 --> 01:06:30,456
You look fantastic,
I didn't recognise you.

790
01:06:30,666 --> 01:06:32,793
- What are you doing here?
- Avoiding government agents.

791
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,295
- Are you here by yourself?
- Where'd you get that dress?

792
01:06:35,463 --> 01:06:37,631
It was a birthday present
from you, actually.

793
01:06:37,798 --> 01:06:39,717
- I have great taste.
- Yes.

794
01:06:39,885 --> 01:06:42,929
- You, uh, wanna dance?
- Oh, no, thank you. No.

795
01:06:54,193 --> 01:06:56,112
Am I making you uncomfortable?

796
01:06:56,488 --> 01:06:57,823
No, no.

797
01:06:58,407 --> 01:07:00,408
I always forget to
wear a deodorant,

798
01:07:00,618 --> 01:07:02,828
and dance with my boss
in front of everyone

799
01:07:03,037 --> 01:07:04,830
that I work with,
in a dress with no back.

800
01:07:05,623 --> 01:07:08,042
- You look great, you
smell great. - Oh, God.

801
01:07:08,210 --> 01:07:10,295
But I could fire you,
if that'd take the edge off.

802
01:07:10,462 --> 01:07:13,423
I actually don't think that you
could tie your shoes without me.

803
01:07:13,633 --> 01:07:14,967
- I'd make it a week.

804
01:07:15,177 --> 01:07:17,846
Really? What's your
social security number?

805
01:07:21,017 --> 01:07:22,601
- Five.
- Five?

806
01:07:24,145 --> 01:07:26,898
You're missing just a
couple of digits there.

807
01:07:27,108 --> 01:07:30,944
The other eight? That's why
I got you, for the other eight.

808
01:07:42,292 --> 01:07:45,211
- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air.

809
01:07:47,131 --> 01:07:49,091
- That was totally weird.
- Totally harmless.

810
01:07:49,301 --> 01:07:51,594
It was totally not harmless,
by the way.

811
01:07:51,762 --> 01:07:54,765
- Nobody was watching us.
- Everybody who I work with...

812
01:07:54,974 --> 01:07:57,810
I think you lost objectivity.
I think they... we just danced.

813
01:07:58,019 --> 01:07:59,770
No, it was not
just the dance!

814
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:01,690
You don't understand
because you're you.

815
01:08:01,898 --> 01:08:04,985
And everybody knows exactly who
you are, and how you are with girls.

816
01:08:05,194 --> 01:08:07,363
And all that,
which is completely fine...

817
01:08:07,572 --> 01:08:10,617
But you know, then me, you're
my boss and I'm dancing...

818
01:08:10,826 --> 01:08:13,996
Because it makes me look like...
the one who's trying to...

819
01:08:14,164 --> 01:08:16,541
I just think you're
overstating, that's all.

820
01:08:16,749 --> 01:08:20,419
And we're here, and then I'm...
wearing this ridiculous dress...

821
01:08:20,713 --> 01:08:23,758
And then we were
dancing like that and...

822
01:08:36,232 --> 01:08:38,525
- I would like a drink, please.
- Got it.

823
01:08:40,486 --> 01:08:43,030
I would like a
vodka martini, please.

824
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:45,826
Very dry with olives,
lot of olives,

825
01:08:46,034 --> 01:08:47,953
like at least three olives.

826
01:08:48,746 --> 01:08:51,665
Two vodka martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.

827
01:08:51,875 --> 01:08:53,418
Make one of them dirty.

828
01:08:58,383 --> 01:09:01,594
- Well... Tony Stark!
- Oh, hey!

829
01:09:01,845 --> 01:09:03,555
Fancy seeing you here.

830
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,853
- Carrie. - Christine.
- That's right.

831
01:09:09,146 --> 01:09:11,481
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.

832
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:13,775
Can I at least get
a reaction from you?

833
01:09:13,984 --> 01:09:15,694
Panic. I would say
panic is my reaction.

834
01:09:15,904 --> 01:09:17,614
I was referring to your
company's involvement

835
01:09:17,822 --> 01:09:19,616
in this latest atrocity.
- They just put my name

836
01:09:19,783 --> 01:09:21,535
on the invitation,
I don't know what to tell you.

837
01:09:21,702 --> 01:09:23,495
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

838
01:09:23,705 --> 01:09:25,873
I was out of town for a couple
of months, in case you didn't hear.

839
01:09:26,082 --> 01:09:27,375
Is this what you call
accountability?

840
01:09:27,709 --> 01:09:30,629
It's a town called Gulmira.
Heard of it?

841
01:09:41,518 --> 01:09:44,187
- When were these taken?
- Yesterday.

842
01:09:44,395 --> 01:09:46,689
- I didn't approve any shipment.
- Well, your company did.

843
01:09:46,857 --> 01:09:48,609
Well, I'm not my company.

844
01:09:49,402 --> 01:09:52,071
- Please, do you mind?
- Have you seen these pictures?

845
01:09:52,447 --> 01:09:55,659
- What's going on? - Tony, you
can't afford to be this naive.

846
01:09:55,868 --> 01:09:57,787
I was naive before,
when they said:

847
01:09:57,995 --> 01:10:00,456
Here's the line, we don't cross it,
this is how we do business.

848
01:10:00,665 --> 01:10:03,668
If we're double-dealing
under the table... are we?

849
01:10:08,299 --> 01:10:10,259
Let's take a picture.
Come on.

850
01:10:10,636 --> 01:10:12,054
Picture time!

851
01:10:13,889 --> 01:10:16,558
Tony... who do you
think locked you out?

852
01:10:16,767 --> 01:10:19,895
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.

853
01:10:22,066 --> 01:10:24,443
It's the only way
I can protect you.

854
01:10:36,208 --> 01:10:38,877
<i>The fifteen miles hike
to the outskirts of Gulmira</i>

855
01:10:39,085 --> 01:10:41,838
<i>can only be described
as a 'descent into Hell'.</i>

856
01:10:42,006 --> 01:10:44,133
<i>Into a modern day
heart of darkness.</i>

857
01:10:44,342 --> 01:10:46,803
<i>Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages</i>

858
01:10:47,011 --> 01:10:48,763
<i>have been driven
from their homes</i>

859
01:10:48,972 --> 01:10:50,891
<i>displaced from their
lands by warlords,</i>

860
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:52,810
<i>emboldened by
a newfound power.</i>

861
01:10:53,102 --> 01:10:55,062
<i>Villagers have been
forced to take shelter</i>

862
01:10:55,230 --> 01:10:57,190
<i>in whatever ways
that they can find.</i>

863
01:10:57,399 --> 01:10:59,067
<i>In the ruins of other villages</i>

864
01:10:59,402 --> 01:11:02,321
<i>or here, in the remnants of
the old Soviet smelting plant.</i>

865
01:11:07,161 --> 01:11:09,663
<i>Recent violence has been
attributed to a group</i>

866
01:11:09,664 --> 01:11:13,084
<i>of foreign fighters, referred to
by locals as the Ten Rings.</i>

867
01:11:13,293 --> 01:11:16,380
<i>As you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.</i>

868
01:11:16,589 --> 01:11:20,217
<i>A mission that can prove fatal to
anyone who stands in their way.</i>

869
01:11:20,636 --> 01:11:23,346
<i>With no political will or
international pressure,</i>

870
01:11:23,346 --> 01:11:25,640
<i>there's very little hope
for these refugees.</i>

871
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:28,727
<i>Around me, a woman begging
for news on her husband</i>

872
01:11:28,937 --> 01:11:30,855
<i>who was kidnapped

<i>Either forced to
join their militia...</i>

874
01:11:37,655 --> 01:11:40,574
<i>... to anyone who will stop
a child's simple question:</i>

875
01:11:40,784 --> 01:11:43,161
<i>"Where are my
mother and father?"</i>

876
01:11:44,288 --> 01:11:46,665
<i>There's very little hope
for these refugees,</i>

877
01:11:46,833 --> 01:11:50,628
<i>refugees who can only wonder
who, if anyone, will help.</i>

878
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:20,778
Faster!

879
01:13:20,986 --> 01:13:23,155
Women on the trucks!
The weapons here!

880
01:13:23,364 --> 01:13:25,450
Abandon houses!
Hurry up!

881
01:13:33,335 --> 01:13:35,003
Hold this rebel!

882
01:13:37,131 --> 01:13:39,258
Put him with the others.

883
01:13:44,473 --> 01:13:45,724
Father!

884
01:13:49,729 --> 01:13:51,272
What the hell is this?

885
01:14:02,119 --> 01:14:03,787
Kill this bastard!

886
01:14:04,204 --> 01:14:05,789
You are incompetent!

887
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:10,337
Turn your head!

888
01:14:11,755 --> 01:14:13,340
Father!

889
01:15:13,871 --> 01:15:15,580
He is all yours.

890
01:16:10,021 --> 01:16:11,648
AIR BASE EDWARDS,
CALIFORNIA

891
01:16:11,773 --> 01:16:13,566
- What the hell was that?
- Are we clear to go in there?

892
01:16:13,734 --> 01:16:14,902
No, sir. They were
using human shields.

893
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:16,278
We never got the green light.

894
01:16:16,487 --> 01:16:18,447
Department of State,
they're gonna be all over this.

895
01:16:19,365 --> 01:16:20,950
We got a bogey.

896
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:22,911
Is CIA on the line?

897
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,122
I got them on line,
they wanna know if it's us.

898
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:26,749
No, that definitely
is not us, sir.

899
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,667
- It wasn't navy.
- Wasn't marines.

900
01:16:28,835 --> 01:16:31,338
I need answers! Can I please
get eyes on target?

901
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:33,841
Get me colonel Rhodes

902
01:16:34,049 --> 01:16:36,343
from the Weapons development
down here now!

903
01:16:41,683 --> 01:16:43,477
We ran an ID check
and crossed reference

904
01:16:43,645 --> 01:16:45,396
with all known databases.
We have nothing.

905
01:16:45,605 --> 01:16:47,315
Any high-altitude surveillance
in the region?

906
01:16:47,524 --> 01:16:49,234
We've got an AWAC and
a Global Hawk in the area.

907
01:16:49,442 --> 01:16:50,860
So this things just
appeared out of nowhere?

908
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:52,530
How come it didn't
show up on the Radar?

909
01:16:52,696 --> 01:16:54,406
It's got a minimum Radar
cross-section, sir.

910
01:16:54,616 --> 01:16:56,367
- Is it stealth?
- No, sir. It's tiny.

911
01:16:56,576 --> 01:16:58,620
We think it's an
unmanned aerial vehicle.

912
01:16:58,871 --> 01:17:01,248
Colonel, what are we
dealing with here?

913
01:17:03,167 --> 01:17:04,961
I'm gonna make a call.

914
01:17:09,467 --> 01:17:10,885
- Hello?
- Tony?

915
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:12,762
- Who is this?
- It's Rhodes.

916
01:17:12,929 --> 01:17:14,055
Sorry, hello?

917
01:17:14,222 --> 01:17:16,016
- I said it's Rhodes.
- Speak up, please.

918
01:17:16,142 --> 01:17:19,228
- What the hell is that noise?
- I'm driving with the top down.

919
01:17:19,436 --> 01:17:21,063
Yeah, well I need
your help right now.

920
01:17:21,272 --> 01:17:22,815
It's funny how
that works, huh?

921
01:17:22,982 --> 01:17:24,984
Yeah, speaking of funny,
we got a weapons depot

922
01:17:25,152 --> 01:17:26,987
that was just blown up
a few cliques from where

923
01:17:27,196 --> 01:17:28,906
you've been held captive.
- Well, that's a hot spot.

924
01:17:29,115 --> 01:17:31,617
Sounds like someone stepped in
and did you job for you.

925
01:17:31,785 --> 01:17:33,411
Why do you sound
out of breath, Tony?

926
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:35,538
- I was just jogging at the canyon.
- I thought you were driving.

927
01:17:35,706 --> 01:17:37,625
Right, I was driving to the
canyon where I'm gonna jog.

928
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:39,543
Are you sure you don't have
any tech in that area...

929
01:17:39,753 --> 01:17:40,920
...I should know about?
- Nope.

930
01:17:41,087 --> 01:17:42,672
Bogey spotted!

931
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:44,842
Okay, good, cause I'm
staring at one right now

932
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:47,177
and it's about to be
blown to kingdom come

933
01:17:54,437 --> 01:17:57,481
War room, this is Whiplash One.
I've got the bogey in my sight.

934
01:17:57,983 --> 01:18:00,693
- Whiplash One, what is it?
- I've got no idea.

935
01:18:00,778 --> 01:18:02,780
- You have radio contact?
- Non responsive, sir.

936
01:18:02,988 --> 01:18:04,698
Then you are clear to engage.

937
01:18:11,624 --> 01:18:14,168
Bogey just went supersonic.
I got a lock!

938
01:18:18,591 --> 01:18:20,509
Incoming missile.
- Flairs!

939
01:18:23,179 --> 01:18:25,431
Wait a second!
Bogey deployed flairs.

940
01:18:39,323 --> 01:18:40,699
Deploy flaps!

941
01:18:41,993 --> 01:18:44,287
Holly... this thing just
drove off the Radar, sir!

942
01:18:44,455 --> 01:18:46,206
Satellite image has been lost.

943
01:18:46,415 --> 01:18:48,667
- No way that's the U.A.V.
- What is it?

944
01:18:48,877 --> 01:18:50,628
I can't see anything.

945
01:18:50,837 --> 01:18:53,214
Whatever it was,
it just bought the farm.

946
01:18:53,632 --> 01:18:55,592
I think bogey has
been handled, sir.

947
01:19:05,104 --> 01:19:07,106
- Hello? - Hi, Rhodey, it's me.
- It's who?

948
01:19:07,315 --> 01:19:10,068
I'm sorry, it IS me. You asked
what that was, and it was me.

949
01:19:10,236 --> 01:19:12,863
No, see... this isn't a game.
You do not send civilian equipment

950
01:19:13,071 --> 01:19:15,365
into my active war zone.
You understand that?

951
01:19:15,575 --> 01:19:18,869
It's not a piece of equipment.
I am in it. It's a suit. It's me!

952
01:19:19,204 --> 01:19:21,122
Rhodey, you got anything for me?

953
01:19:22,917 --> 01:19:26,003
Mark your position and
return to base. - Roger that.

954
01:19:28,132 --> 01:19:31,093
On your belly!
It looks like a... man!

955
01:19:31,301 --> 01:19:33,804
Shake him off!
Move, move!

956
01:19:41,522 --> 01:19:43,441
I'm hit!
I'm hit!

957
01:19:49,073 --> 01:19:50,783
Eject! Eject!

958
01:19:57,124 --> 01:19:58,875
Whiplash One down.

959
01:19:59,043 --> 01:20:02,338
- Whiplash 2, do you see a chute?
- Negative! No chute! No chute!

960
01:20:08,012 --> 01:20:09,972
My chute's jammed!

961
01:20:14,478 --> 01:20:16,688
Sir, I've got a visual
on a bogey.

962
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:20,276
Whiplash 2, reengage. If you
get a clear shot, you take it!

963
01:20:21,528 --> 01:20:24,364
Major, we don't even know what we're
shooting at. Call off the Raptors.

964
01:20:24,615 --> 01:20:27,451
That thing just took out an F-22
inside the legal no-fly zone.

965
01:20:27,577 --> 01:20:29,496
Whiplash 2, if you have
a clear shot, take it.

966
01:20:29,704 --> 01:20:32,082
They've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.

967
01:20:32,291 --> 01:20:33,417
Keep going!

968
01:20:40,467 --> 01:20:42,886
Got a chute!
Got a chute!

969
01:20:49,645 --> 01:20:52,523
- Tony, are you still there?
- Hey, thanks.

970
01:20:52,691 --> 01:20:55,402
Oh my God, you crazy
son of a bitch!

971
01:20:55,610 --> 01:20:57,862
You owe me a plane,
you know that, right?

972
01:20:58,781 --> 01:21:01,283
Yeah, well, technically
he hit me, so...

973
01:21:01,492 --> 01:21:04,120
Now are you gonna come by and
see what I'm working on? - No, no.

974
01:21:04,288 --> 01:21:05,831
The less I know the better.

975
01:21:06,039 --> 01:21:07,958
Now what am I supposed
to tell to the press?

976
01:21:08,126 --> 01:21:10,002
Training exercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?

977
01:21:10,211 --> 01:21:11,921
It's not that simple.

978
01:21:12,339 --> 01:21:14,215
An unfortunate
training exercise

979
01:21:14,425 --> 01:21:17,136
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.

980
01:21:17,344 --> 01:21:20,264
I'm pleased to report that
the pilot was not injured.

981
01:21:20,849 --> 01:21:24,519
As for the unexpected turn of
events on the ground in Gulmira,

982
01:21:24,728 --> 01:21:28,106
it is still unclear who
or what intervened,

983
01:21:28,274 --> 01:21:31,944
but I can assure you that the U.S.
Government was not involved.

984
01:21:36,910 --> 01:21:39,496
Oh, it isn't that bad, sir.

985
01:21:39,746 --> 01:21:42,707
Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this is going to hurt.

986
01:21:42,875 --> 01:21:44,793
Be gentle,
this is my first time.

987
01:21:45,336 --> 01:21:47,213
I designed this to come off.

988
01:21:51,511 --> 01:21:53,471
Please try not to move.

989
01:21:54,513 --> 01:21:56,515
What's going on here?

990
01:22:00,729 --> 01:22:04,066
Let's face it, this is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.

991
01:22:05,318 --> 01:22:07,487
Are those bullet holes?

992
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:35,145
Welcome.

993
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:40,359
Compliments of Tony Stark.

994
01:22:40,735 --> 01:22:44,155
If you killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.

995
01:22:44,323 --> 01:22:46,492
You paid us trinkets
to kill a prince.

996
01:22:46,701 --> 01:22:48,661
Show me the weapon.

997
01:22:49,454 --> 01:22:52,707
Come. Leave your
guards outside.

998
01:23:08,769 --> 01:23:11,647
His escape bore
unexpected fruit.

999
01:23:13,775 --> 01:23:15,943
So this is how he did it.

1000
01:23:16,361 --> 01:23:20,407
This is only a first crude effort.
Stark has perfected his design.

1001
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:24,245
He has made a
masterpiece of death.

1002
01:23:24,412 --> 01:23:27,749
A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.

1003
01:23:28,876 --> 01:23:32,129
And you dream of Stark's throne.

1004
01:23:32,755 --> 01:23:35,174
We have a common enemy.

1005
01:23:39,222 --> 01:23:41,599
We are still in business.

1006
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:45,604
I will give you these designs...

1007
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,649
...as a gift.

1008
01:23:49,484 --> 01:23:51,444
And in return...

1009
01:23:52,571 --> 01:23:57,117
...I hope you repay me
with a gift of iron soldiers.

1010
01:24:08,006 --> 01:24:10,925
This is the only gift
you will receive.

1011
01:24:13,762 --> 01:24:15,264
Technology.

1012
01:24:16,808 --> 01:24:20,603
That's always been your Achilles
heel in this part of the world.

1013
01:24:21,481 --> 01:24:24,817
Don't worry. It will only
last for 15 minutes.

1014
01:24:25,444 --> 01:24:28,405
That's the least
of your problems.

1015
01:24:32,869 --> 01:24:35,622
Bring the armour
and the rest of it.

1016
01:24:36,957 --> 01:24:39,251
Alright, lets finish up here.

1017
01:24:42,672 --> 01:24:45,341
Set up Sector 16
underneath the Arc reactor.

1018
01:24:45,509 --> 01:24:49,012
And I want this dead and masked.
Recruit our top engineers.

1019
01:24:49,180 --> 01:24:51,140
I want a prototype right away.

1020
01:24:59,651 --> 01:25:01,027
Are you busy?

1021
01:25:01,695 --> 01:25:05,032
I need you to go to my office
and hack into the mainframe.

1022
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:08,160
You're gonna retrieve all
the recent shipping manifests.

1023
01:25:08,327 --> 01:25:10,788
This is a lock chip,
this will get you in.

1024
01:25:10,997 --> 01:25:13,333
It's probably under
Executive Files, if not...

1025
01:25:13,459 --> 01:25:15,795
they put it on a ghost drive,
in which case you need to look

1026
01:25:16,003 --> 01:25:17,630
for the lowest
numeric heading.

1027
01:25:17,797 --> 01:25:20,008
And what do you plan to do
with this information

1028
01:25:20,217 --> 01:25:21,552
if I bring it back here?
- Same drill.

1029
01:25:21,719 --> 01:25:23,846
They've been dealing under
the table, I'm gonna stop them.

1030
01:25:23,972 --> 01:25:26,849
I'm gonna find my weapons
and destroy them.

1031
01:25:27,266 --> 01:25:28,809
Tony...

1032
01:25:30,437 --> 01:25:33,148
you know that I would
help you with anything,

1033
01:25:33,316 --> 01:25:36,277
but I can not help you if you're
gonna start all of this again.

1034
01:25:36,486 --> 01:25:39,697
There is nothing except this.
There's no art openings,

1035
01:25:39,907 --> 01:25:43,160
there's no benefit,
there's nothing to sign.

1036
01:25:44,037 --> 01:25:47,415
There's the next mission,
and nothing else.

1037
01:25:48,542 --> 01:25:50,502
Is that so?

1038
01:25:51,671 --> 01:25:53,631
Well, then I quit.

1039
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,677
You stood by my side
all these years

1040
01:25:57,887 --> 01:26:00,264
while I reaped the
benefits of destruction.

1041
01:26:00,599 --> 01:26:02,517
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people

1042
01:26:02,684 --> 01:26:04,435
that I've put in harm's way,
your going to walk out?

1043
01:26:04,603 --> 01:26:08,440
You're gonna kill yourself, Tony.
I'm not gonna be a part of it.

1044
01:26:08,942 --> 01:26:12,987
I shouldn't be alive...
unless it was for a reason.

1045
01:26:14,823 --> 01:26:16,783
I'm not crazy, Pepper.

1046
01:26:16,993 --> 01:26:20,120
I just finally know
what I have to do.

1047
01:26:24,084 --> 01:26:27,463
And I know in my heart
that it's right.

1048
01:26:42,023 --> 01:26:44,358
You're all I have
too, you know.

1049
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:52,898
Sector 16?

1050
01:27:54,025 --> 01:27:55,944
What are you up to, Obadiah?

1051
01:28:07,999 --> 01:28:10,835
You did not tell us that
the target you paid us to kill

1052
01:28:11,045 --> 01:28:13,255
was the great Tony Stark.
As you can see,

1053
01:28:13,465 --> 01:28:16,301
Obadiah Stane, your deception
and lies will cost you dearly.

1054
01:28:16,468 --> 01:28:19,304
The price to kill Tony Stark
has just gone up.

1055
01:28:23,184 --> 01:28:26,854
So... what are we
gonna do about this?

1056
01:28:38,411 --> 01:28:41,873
I know what you're
going through, Pepper.

1057
01:28:49,383 --> 01:28:52,761
Ah, Tony. He always gets
the good stuff, doesn't he?

1058
01:29:13,369 --> 01:29:15,454
I was so happy...

1059
01:29:16,706 --> 01:29:20,835
when he came home. It was like
we got him back from the dead.

1060
01:29:23,381 --> 01:29:25,425
And now I realise...

1061
01:29:27,636 --> 01:29:31,348
...well, Tony never really
did come home, did he?

1062
01:29:32,099 --> 01:29:35,060
He left a part of himself
in that cave.

1063
01:29:37,481 --> 01:29:39,441
Breaks my heart.

1064
01:29:40,986 --> 01:29:42,237
Well...

1065
01:29:43,321 --> 01:29:45,490
He is a complicated person.

1066
01:29:47,618 --> 01:29:51,288
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be alright.

1067
01:29:57,171 --> 01:30:00,049
You are a very rare woman.

1068
01:30:02,051 --> 01:30:04,554
Tony doesn't know
how lucky he is.

1069
01:30:06,599 --> 01:30:08,726
Thank you. Thanks.

1070
01:30:10,729 --> 01:30:12,648
I gotta get back there.

1071
01:30:17,696 --> 01:30:19,990
Is that today's paper?

1072
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:22,409
Yes.

1073
01:30:22,993 --> 01:30:25,704
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

1074
01:30:25,914 --> 01:30:28,124
- Puzzle.
- Of course.

1075
01:30:31,336 --> 01:30:33,130
Take care.

1076
01:30:55,532 --> 01:30:57,325
Ms. Potts?
We had an appointment.

1077
01:30:57,410 --> 01:30:59,287
Did you forget about
our appointment?

1078
01:30:59,453 --> 01:31:02,081
Nope. Right now,
come with me.

1079
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:06,961
L'll give you the meeting
of your life. Your office.

1080
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:10,424
We've been working our best.

1081
01:31:10,925 --> 01:31:13,845
Absolutely, we're... I'm gonna
have to call you back.

1082
01:31:14,471 --> 01:31:17,516
Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored
what you've asked us

1083
01:31:17,725 --> 01:31:20,436
and it seems as though there's
a little hiccup, actually...

1084
01:31:20,646 --> 01:31:22,856
- A hiccup?
- Yes, to power the suit...

1085
01:31:23,024 --> 01:31:25,359
sir, the technology actually
doesn't exist. So it's...

1086
01:31:25,609 --> 01:31:27,528
Wait, wait, the technology?

1087
01:31:27,988 --> 01:31:31,074
William, here is
the technology.

1088
01:31:31,533 --> 01:31:33,911
I've asked you to simply
make it smaller.

1089
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:36,372
Okay, sir, that's what
we're trying to do,

1090
01:31:36,581 --> 01:31:38,499
but honestly,
it's impossible.

1091
01:31:38,667 --> 01:31:41,837
Tony Stark was able
to build this in a cave!

1092
01:31:42,338 --> 01:31:44,632
With a box of scraps!

1093
01:31:46,176 --> 01:31:49,512
I'm sorry.
I'm not Tony Stark.

1094
01:32:04,573 --> 01:32:05,907
Tony?

1095
01:32:08,202 --> 01:32:09,954
Tony, are you there?

1096
01:32:13,041 --> 01:32:14,334
Breathe.

1097
01:32:15,211 --> 01:32:17,546
Easy, easy...

1098
01:32:19,966 --> 01:32:22,468
You remember this one, right?

1099
01:32:23,512 --> 01:32:25,931
It's a shame the government
didn't approve.

1100
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:29,852
There are so many applications
regarding short-term paralysis.

1101
01:32:31,688 --> 01:32:33,273
Ah, Tony.

1102
01:32:35,734 --> 01:32:39,571
When I ordered
the hit on you,

1103
01:32:42,242 --> 01:32:44,786
I was worried that I was...

1104
01:32:47,583 --> 01:32:50,210
...killing the golden goose.

1105
01:32:51,045 --> 01:32:53,005
But, you see...

1106
01:32:53,756 --> 01:32:57,634
it was just fate
that you survived it,

1107
01:33:02,934 --> 01:33:06,604
leaving one last
golden egg to give.

1108
01:33:10,735 --> 01:33:14,071
You really think that just
because you have an idea,

1109
01:33:14,281 --> 01:33:16,199
it belongs to you?

1110
01:33:19,370 --> 01:33:23,457
Your father, he helped to
give us the atomic bomb.

1111
01:33:23,625 --> 01:33:26,502
Now what kind of world
would it be today

1112
01:33:26,712 --> 01:33:28,630
if he was as selfish as you?

1113
01:33:38,058 --> 01:33:40,060
Oh, it's beautiful.

1114
01:33:42,313 --> 01:33:43,856
Ah, Tony...

1115
01:33:45,192 --> 01:33:47,611
This is your Ninth Symphony.

1116
01:33:48,905 --> 01:33:51,657
What a masterpiece!
Look at that.

1117
01:33:52,617 --> 01:33:54,744
This is your legacy.

1118
01:33:56,872 --> 01:33:59,583
The generation of weapons...

1119
01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:02,545
...with this at its heart.

1120
01:34:04,758 --> 01:34:08,428
The weapons that will help
stir the world back on course.

1121
01:34:08,637 --> 01:34:11,306
With the balance of power
in our hands.

1122
01:34:12,266 --> 01:34:14,227
In the right hands.

1123
01:34:16,897 --> 01:34:21,192
I wish you could see
my prototype.

1124
01:34:22,653 --> 01:34:27,616
It's not as... not as
conservative as yours.

1125
01:34:29,953 --> 01:34:32,622
Too bad you had to
involve Pepper in this.

1126
01:34:33,166 --> 01:34:35,626
I would've preferred
that she lived.

1127
01:34:48,058 --> 01:34:50,060
What do you mean he paid
to have Tony killed?

1128
01:34:50,270 --> 01:34:52,021
Pepper, slow down.

1129
01:34:52,231 --> 01:34:55,192
Why would Obadiah...
okay, where is Tony now?

1130
01:34:55,359 --> 01:34:57,486
I don't know, he's not
answering his phone.

1131
01:34:57,695 --> 01:34:59,739
Please go there and make
sure everything's okay.

1132
01:34:59,906 --> 01:35:02,284
Thank you, Rhodey.
I know a shortcut.

1133
01:36:05,526 --> 01:36:07,069
Good boy.

1134
01:36:44,989 --> 01:36:46,115
Tony?

1135
01:36:48,577 --> 01:36:50,078
Tony?

1136
01:36:51,372 --> 01:36:52,665
Tony?

1137
01:36:58,130 --> 01:36:59,340
Tony!

1138
01:37:02,635 --> 01:37:04,971
- Are you okay?
- Where is Pepper?

1139
01:37:05,681 --> 01:37:09,226
She's fine. She's with five agents
that are about to arrest Obadiah.

1140
01:37:09,810 --> 01:37:11,729
That's not gonna be enough.

1141
01:37:34,715 --> 01:37:36,467
Section 16.

1142
01:37:37,385 --> 01:37:39,012
Section 16...

1143
01:37:39,637 --> 01:37:41,097
There it is.

1144
01:37:49,107 --> 01:37:51,443
My key's not working,
it's not opening the door.

1145
01:37:51,694 --> 01:37:54,030
Wow, what is that? It's like
a little device, like a thing

1146
01:37:54,238 --> 01:37:57,366
that's gonna pick the lock?
- You may wanna take few steps back.

1147
01:38:15,889 --> 01:38:19,017
That's the coolest thing I've
ever seen. - Not bad, huh?

1148
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:21,854
Let's do it.

1149
01:38:27,569 --> 01:38:29,780
You need me to do
anything else?

1150
01:38:30,198 --> 01:38:32,075
Keep the skies clear.

1151
01:38:36,706 --> 01:38:38,124
Damn!

1152
01:38:45,591 --> 01:38:47,509
Next time, baby.

1153
01:39:16,336 --> 01:39:18,088
Looks like you were right.

1154
01:39:18,422 --> 01:39:20,006
He was building a suit.

1155
01:39:20,216 --> 01:39:22,093
I thought it'll be bigger.

1156
01:40:05,102 --> 01:40:06,479
Take him out!

1157
01:40:16,366 --> 01:40:18,743
How do you think the Mark One
chest piece is gonna hold up?

1158
01:40:18,911 --> 01:40:20,704
48% power and falling, sir.

1159
01:40:20,913 --> 01:40:23,749
That chest piece was never
designed for sustained flight.

1160
01:40:23,958 --> 01:40:25,459
Keep me posted.

1161
01:40:26,712 --> 01:40:28,088
- Pepper.
- Tony?

1162
01:40:28,296 --> 01:40:30,131
- Tony, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1163
01:40:30,341 --> 01:40:32,510
- Obadiah, he's gone insane.
- I know. Listen!

1164
01:40:32,718 --> 01:40:34,803
- You better get outta there!
- He built the suit.

1165
01:40:35,013 --> 01:40:36,389
Get outta there, right now!

1166
01:40:47,027 --> 01:40:49,321
Where do you think
you're going?

1167
01:40:54,703 --> 01:40:57,247
Your services are
no longer required.

1168
01:40:57,957 --> 01:40:59,166
Stane!

1169
01:41:23,404 --> 01:41:25,822
- I love this suit!
- Put them down.

1170
01:41:26,032 --> 01:41:28,242
Collateral damage, Tony.

1171
01:41:29,494 --> 01:41:31,621
Defer the power
to chest piece.

1172
01:41:40,132 --> 01:41:42,176
Power reduced to 19%.

1173
01:41:49,268 --> 01:41:50,519
Lady!

1174
01:42:16,008 --> 01:42:19,053
For thirty years,
I've been holding you up.

1175
01:42:22,724 --> 01:42:25,476
I built this company
from nothing!

1176
01:42:27,147 --> 01:42:29,941
And nothing is gonna
stand in my way.

1177
01:42:35,656 --> 01:42:38,075
And least of all, you.

1178
01:42:47,253 --> 01:42:50,006
Impressive!
You upgraded your armour.

1179
01:42:50,215 --> 01:42:53,093
I've made some
upgrades of my own.

1180
01:43:01,020 --> 01:43:02,938
Sir, it appears that
his suit can fly.

1181
01:43:03,147 --> 01:43:05,107
Duly noted. Take me
to the maximum altitude.

1182
01:43:05,275 --> 01:43:07,610
With only 15% power, the odds
of reaching that altitude...

1183
01:43:07,820 --> 01:43:09,697
I know the math! Do it!

1184
01:43:17,122 --> 01:43:19,708
Sir, you're not gonna believe this.
That thing is back.

1185
01:43:19,876 --> 01:43:22,169
Get me major Allen.
Scramble the jets!

1186
01:43:24,548 --> 01:43:27,675
Not necessary, people,
just the training exercise.

1187
01:43:36,688 --> 01:43:38,856
- 13% power, sir.
- Climb!

1188
01:43:42,361 --> 01:43:44,446
- 11%.
- Keep going!

1189
01:43:50,954 --> 01:43:54,040
- 7% power. - Just leave it on
the screen, stop telling me.

1190
01:44:03,719 --> 01:44:05,221
You had a great idea, Tony,

1191
01:44:05,429 --> 01:44:08,098
but my suit is more
advanced in every way!

1192
01:44:08,308 --> 01:44:10,560
How'd you solve
the icing problem?

1193
01:44:10,686 --> 01:44:12,229
Icing problem?

1194
01:44:14,149 --> 01:44:15,984
Might want to look into it.

1195
01:44:27,581 --> 01:44:28,915
2%.

1196
01:44:30,918 --> 01:44:33,837
We are now running on
emergency backup power.

1197
01:44:44,768 --> 01:44:46,019
- Potts!
- Tony!

1198
01:44:46,229 --> 01:44:48,189
Oh my God, are you okay?

1199
01:44:48,356 --> 01:44:51,275
I'm almost dead of power,
I gotta get out of this thing.

1200
01:44:51,443 --> 01:44:54,070
L'll be right there.
- Nice try.

1201
01:45:05,877 --> 01:45:07,587
Weapons status?

1202
01:45:07,795 --> 01:45:09,922
Repulsors are off line.

1203
01:45:13,803 --> 01:45:15,137
Flairs!

1204
01:45:23,481 --> 01:45:25,692
Very clever, Tony.

1205
01:45:30,531 --> 01:45:32,325
- Potts.
- Tony!

1206
01:45:32,533 --> 01:45:35,035
This isn't working, we're gonna
have to overload the reactor

1207
01:45:35,245 --> 01:45:37,789
and blast the roof.
- How are you gonna do that?

1208
01:45:37,999 --> 01:45:39,166
You're gonna do it.

1209
01:45:39,375 --> 01:45:41,293
Go to the central console,
open up bolt of circuits.

1210
01:45:41,461 --> 01:45:43,213
When I clear the roof
l'll let you know

1211
01:45:43,421 --> 01:45:45,506
and you're gonna hit
the master bypass button.

1212
01:45:45,758 --> 01:45:47,885
That's gonna fry
everything up here.

1213
01:45:49,012 --> 01:45:50,722
Okay, I am going in now.

1214
01:45:50,930 --> 01:45:54,642
Make sure you wait till I clear
the roof, l'll buy you some time.

1215
01:46:03,612 --> 01:46:05,698
This looks important.

1216
01:46:25,180 --> 01:46:28,099
I never had a taste
for this sort of thing,

1217
01:46:28,308 --> 01:46:31,978
but I must admit, I'm
deeply enjoying the suit.

1218
01:46:40,156 --> 01:46:43,033
You finally outdid
yourself, Tony.

1219
01:46:44,786 --> 01:46:47,413
It would've made
your father proud.

1220
01:46:51,419 --> 01:46:54,088
It's ready, Tony!
Get off the roof!

1221
01:47:12,443 --> 01:47:13,861
Tony!

1222
01:47:14,947 --> 01:47:16,865
How ironic, Tony!

1223
01:47:18,284 --> 01:47:20,703
Trying to free
the world of weapons,

1224
01:47:20,912 --> 01:47:23,081
you gave it
the best one ever!

1225
01:47:23,290 --> 01:47:25,375
- Pepper!
- And now...

1226
01:47:26,836 --> 01:47:29,129
I'm gonna kill you with it!

1227
01:47:31,675 --> 01:47:34,219
You ripped up my
targeting system.

1228
01:47:34,386 --> 01:47:37,097
- Hit the button!
- You told me not to!

1229
01:47:37,390 --> 01:47:39,392
Hold still, you little prick.

1230
01:47:41,311 --> 01:47:43,772
- Just do it!
- You'll die!

1231
01:47:46,902 --> 01:47:48,236
Push it!

1232
01:48:43,218 --> 01:48:44,678
Tony!

1233
01:48:52,938 --> 01:48:54,899
We've all received
the official statement

1234
01:48:55,107 --> 01:48:57,609
of what occurred at
Stark Industries last night.

1235
01:48:57,819 --> 01:49:01,072
There have been unconfirmed
reports that a robotic prototype

1236
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:04,326
malfunctioned and caused
damage to the Arc reactor.

1237
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:09,666
"Iron Man", that's kinda catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.

1238
01:49:09,875 --> 01:49:12,794
It's not technically accurate,
since it's a gold-titanium alloy,

1239
01:49:13,004 --> 01:49:15,506
but it's kinda attractive
name anyway.

1240
01:49:15,715 --> 01:49:17,425
Here is your alibi.

1241
01:49:18,385 --> 01:49:20,721
- Okay.
- You were on your yacht.

1242
01:49:20,971 --> 01:49:23,140
We told Pepper to put
you in Avalon all night

1243
01:49:23,308 --> 01:49:25,476
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

1244
01:49:25,686 --> 01:49:28,522
I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just Pepper and me,

1245
01:49:28,731 --> 01:49:30,441
alone on the island.

1246
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:34,612
That's what happened.
Just read it word for word.

1247
01:49:36,490 --> 01:49:38,409
There's nothing
about Stane here.

1248
01:49:38,576 --> 01:49:41,286
That's been handled.
He's on vacation.

1249
01:49:41,538 --> 01:49:44,457
Small aircraft have such
a poor safety record.

1250
01:49:44,667 --> 01:49:47,252
What about this whole story
that it's a body guard?

1251
01:49:47,462 --> 01:49:49,839
He's my body...?
That's kinda flimsy.

1252
01:49:50,006 --> 01:49:52,216
This isn't my first rodeo,
Mr. Stark.

1253
01:49:52,426 --> 01:49:55,845
Just stick to the official statement
and soon this will all be behind you.

1254
01:49:56,138 --> 01:49:58,390
You've got 90 seconds.

1255
01:50:01,144 --> 01:50:02,854
Oh, agent Coulson.

1256
01:50:03,272 --> 01:50:07,109
I just wanted to say thank you
very much for all of your help.

1257
01:50:07,485 --> 01:50:10,530
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.

1258
01:50:10,739 --> 01:50:13,992
- From the Strategic Homeland...
- Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

1259
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:15,578
Right.

1260
01:50:16,330 --> 01:50:19,332
- Lets get the show on the road.
- You know, it's actually...

1261
01:50:19,541 --> 01:50:22,335
...not that bad... even I
don't think I'm Iron Man.

1262
01:50:22,461 --> 01:50:24,255
- You're not Iron Man.
- Yeah I am.

1263
01:50:24,422 --> 01:50:26,174
- You're not.
- Suite yourself.

1264
01:50:26,466 --> 01:50:28,760
If I were Iron Man,
I'd have this girlfriend

1265
01:50:28,927 --> 01:50:31,263
who knew my true identity.
She'd be a wreck.

1266
01:50:31,472 --> 01:50:33,766
She'd always be worrying
that I was gonna die,

1267
01:50:33,975 --> 01:50:36,310
and yet proud of a man
I become. She'd be...

1268
01:50:36,478 --> 01:50:39,522
wildly conflicted, which
would only make her more...

1269
01:50:40,441 --> 01:50:43,277
crazy about me. Tell me you
never think about that night?

1270
01:50:43,403 --> 01:50:45,363
- What night?
- You know.

1271
01:50:47,783 --> 01:50:51,286
Are you talking about...
the night that we danced,

1272
01:50:51,871 --> 01:50:54,332
and went up to the roof...

1273
01:50:54,917 --> 01:50:56,251
and then...

1274
01:50:57,211 --> 01:51:01,090
you went downstairs
to get me a drink, and you...

1275
01:51:01,883 --> 01:51:04,135
left me there by myself?

1276
01:51:04,428 --> 01:51:06,889
Is that the night
you're talking about?

1277
01:51:09,142 --> 01:51:10,852
I thought so.

1278
01:51:12,730 --> 01:51:16,275
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- Yes, that'd be all, Ms. Potts.

1279
01:51:16,484 --> 01:51:19,445
And now Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.

1280
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:22,824
He will not be taking
any questions, thank you.

1281
01:51:25,912 --> 01:51:28,832
It's been a while since
I was in front of you,

1282
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:31,709
I figure l'll stick
to the cards this time.

1283
01:51:33,254 --> 01:51:35,548
There's been speculation that
I was involved in the events

1284
01:51:35,757 --> 01:51:37,675
that occurred on a freeway
and the rooftop...

1285
01:51:37,885 --> 01:51:40,846
I'm sorry Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that

1286
01:51:40,972 --> 01:51:43,891
that was a bodyguard in a suit,
that conveniently appeared,

1287
01:51:44,058 --> 01:51:46,810
despite the fact that...
- I know that it's confusing...

1288
01:51:47,103 --> 01:51:49,814
It is one thing to question
the official story,

1289
01:51:50,024 --> 01:51:52,109
and another entirely
to make wild accusations

1290
01:51:52,319 --> 01:51:54,028
or insinuate that
I'm a superhero.

1291
01:51:54,237 --> 01:51:56,572
- I never said you're
a superhero. - You didn't?

1292
01:51:56,740 --> 01:51:59,660
Well, good, because that
would be outlandish and...

1293
01:51:59,953 --> 01:52:01,579
...fantastic.

1294
01:52:03,957 --> 01:52:07,377
I'm just not the hero type,
clearly. With this...

1295
01:52:07,878 --> 01:52:10,589
long list of character defects
and all the mistakes I've made,

1296
01:52:10,757 --> 01:52:12,550
largely in public.

1297
01:52:13,134 --> 01:52:15,637
- Just stick to the cards.
- Yeah, okay.

1298
01:52:17,682 --> 01:52:19,475
The truth is...

1299
01:52:25,024 --> 01:52:27,360
I am Iron Man.

1300
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:43,119
THE END
Subtitles by:

1301
02:00:09,688 --> 02:00:13,188
Jarvis?
- Welcome home, sir.

1302
02:00:16,291 --> 02:00:18,052
I am Iron Man.

1303
02:00:19,254 --> 02:00:21,492
You think you're the only
Superhero in the world?

1304
02:00:21,994 --> 02:00:26,494
We are part a bigger universe,
yet we know nothing.

1305
02:00:26,995 --> 02:00:28,495
Who the hell are you?

1306
02:00:29,497 --> 02:00:31,497
Nick Fury,
the Director of SHIELD

1307
02:00:32,499 --> 02:00:33,499
Oh.

1308
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,500
I'm here to talk to you about
the Avenger Initiative.
