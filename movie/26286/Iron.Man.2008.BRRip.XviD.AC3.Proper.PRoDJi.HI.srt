Is it a good representation

No. The Springs was actually

not "spring" like the season.
- So?

204

arc reactor technology.

617
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:25,510
Ah, come on.
The arc reactor,
that's a publicity stunt!

618
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:28,550
Tony, come on.
We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!

619
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:32,030
It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.

620
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,510
The arc was
never cost effective.

621
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:35,270
We knew that
before we built it.

622
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:38,310
Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

623
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:39,910
Maybe.

624
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:42,470
Huh? Am I right?
We haven't had a breakthrough
in that in what?

625
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:44,470
30 years.
- That's what they say.

626
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:49,630
Could you have
a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?

627
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:52,750
Never mind who told me.
Show me.
- It's Rhodey or Pepper.

628
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:54,990
I want to see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.

629
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:04,510
Okay.
- Okay?

630
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:08,870
It works.

631
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:16,870
Listen to me, Tony.
We're a team.
Do you understand?

632
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:20,070
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,

633
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:21,510
like your father and I.

634
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:23,310
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads-up, okay?

635
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:24,870
But if I had...
- Tony.

636
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:27,870
Tony, no more of this
"ready, fire, aim" business.

637
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:31,070
You understand me?
- That was Dad's line.

638
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:33,190
You gotta let me
handle this.

639

We're gonna have to play
a whole different
kind of ball now.

640
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:37,430
We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.

641
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:40,830
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

658
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:31,950
I just need your
help for a sec.

Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

660
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:37,350
It was.
It is now an antique.

661
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:40,110
This is what will
be keeping me alive
for the foreseeable future.

662
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,110
I'm swapping it up
for an upgraded unit,

663
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,790
and I just ran into
a little speed bump.

664
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:46,190
Speed bump,
what does that mean?

665
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:47,550
It's nothing.
It's just a little snag.

666
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:50,830
There's an exposed wire
under this device.

667
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:53,910
And it's contacting the
socket wall and causing
a little bit of a short.

668
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:56,390
It's fine.

669
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:58,310
What do you want me to do?
- Put that on
the table over there.

670
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:00,070
That is irrelevant.
- Oh, my God!

671
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:04,950
I want you to reach in,
and you're just gonna
gently lift the wire out.

672
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:06,990
Is it safe?
- Yeah, it should be fine.

673
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:08,670
It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch

674
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:10,030
the socket wall
or it goes "beep."

675
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:11,150
What do you mean,
"Operation"?

676
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:12,510
It's just a game,
never mind.

677
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:16,390
Just gently lift the wire.
Okay? Great.
- Okay.

678
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:20,590
You know,
I don't think that I'm
qualified to do this.

679
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:24,550
No, you're fine.
You're the most capable,

a problem to ask?
'Cause I'm...

682
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:33,750
Okay, okay.
- I really need your help here.

683
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:34,670
Okay.

684
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:40,590
Oh, there's pus!

685
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:45,110
It's not pus.
It's an inorganic plasmic
discharge from the device,

686
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:47,030
not from my body.
- It smells!

687
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:48,870
Yeah, it does.

688

you got it?

690

Okay, I got it! I got it!
- Okay, you got it?

691

I was trying to
tell you before.

695
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:00,150
Okay, now make sure
that when you pull
it out, you don't...

696
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:01,990

at the end of it!

699
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:06,350

Don't put it back in!

Take this. Take this.

it out really quick.

- What?

705
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:17,950
Is it?
- It's gonna be okay.

706
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:20,950
I'm gonna make this okay.
- Let's hope.

that to the base plate.

in my experience,

733
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:43,910
no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump
a pilot's instinct,

734
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:45,350
his insight,

735
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:48,150
that ability to look
into a situation
beyond the obvious

736
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:51,750
and discern its outcome,
or a pilot's judgment.

Look who fell
out of the sky.
Mr. Tony Stark.

740
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:58,630
Hello, sir.
- Speaking of
manned or unmanned,

741
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:00,510
you gotta get him
to tell you about the
time he guessed wrong

742
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:03,110
at spring break.
Just remember that,
spring break, 1987.

743
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:04,390
That lovely lady
you woke up with.
- Don't do that!

744
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:05,830
What was his name?
- Don't do that.

745
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:06,950
Was it Ivan?
- Don't do that.

746
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:08,190
They'll believe it.
Don't do that.

747
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:09,670
Okay.
- Don't do that.

748

- Why?

751
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:19,430
I swear,
I didn't expect to see you
walking around so soon.

752
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,270
I'm doing a little
better than walking.

753
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:23,350
Really?
- Yeah.

754
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:26,030
Rhodey, I'm working on
something big.

755
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:30,030
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be a part of it.

756
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:32,510
You're about to make
a whole lot of people
around here real happy,

757
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:35,430
'cause that little stunt
at the press conference,

758
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:37,350
that was a doozy.

759
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:41,750
This is not for the military.
I'm not... It's different.

760
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:44,350
What? You're
a humanitarian now
or something?

761
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:45,790
I need you to listen to me.
- No.

762
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:49,310
What you need is time
to get your mind right.

763
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:52,950
I'm serious.
- Okay.

764
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:57,830
It's nice seeing you, Tony.

765
00:51:57,950 --> 00:51:58,950
Thanks.

crazy about me.

1515
01:50:40,870 --> 01:50:42,470
Tell me you never
think about that night.

1516
01:50:42,510 --> 01:50:44,270
What night?
- You know.

1517
01:50:47,110 --> 01:50:52,430
Are you talking about
the night that we danced
and went up on the roof,

1518
01:50:54,190 --> 01:50:59,590
and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

1519
01:50:59,630 --> 01:51:02,470
and you left me there,
by myself?

1520
01:51:03,910 --> 01:51:06,390
Is that the night
you're talking about?

1521
01:51:06,470 --> 01:51:07,230
Mmm-hmm.

1522
01:51:08,430 --> 01:51:09,150
Thought so.

1523
01:51:12,070 --> 01:51:15,710
Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- Yes, that will be all,
Miss Potts.

1524
01:51:15,750 --> 01:51:19,230
<i>And now, Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.</i>

<i>He will not be
taking any questions.
Thank you.</i>

I was in front of you.</i>

and the rooftop...</i>

1532
01:51:37,670 --> 01:51:39,990
I'm sorry, Mr. Stark,
but do you honestly
expect us to believe that

1533
01:51:40,070 --> 01:51:43,670
that was a bodyguard
in a suit that
conveniently appeared,

I know that it's confusing.</i>

1535

the official story,
and another thing entirely</i>

1536
01:51:50,350 --> 01:51:53,510
<i>to make wild accusations,
or insinuate
that I'm a superhero.</i>

01:51:53,550 --> 01:51:55,110
I never said
you were a superhero.

1538

<i>Didn't?
- Mmm-mmm.</i>

<i>Well, good,

You think you're the only

Mr. Stark,
you've become part

You just don't

Ah.
