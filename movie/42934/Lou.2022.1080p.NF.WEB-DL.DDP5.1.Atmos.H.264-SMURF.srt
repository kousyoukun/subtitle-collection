I left her a note and some clues to follow us,

276
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,000
‎别急嘛
Uh-- Whoa.

277
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,000

‎好吧 我还有一件事要处理
-All right, I've gotta do one more thing.

283
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,660
‎然后你就要和我一起开始探险了
And then you and I are gonna start our adventure together.

‎你看到什么了吗
You see anything?

288
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:53,290
‎-你认识他们  ‎-托尼和格里 是菲利普的战友
-You know them? -Tony and Gerry. They served with Philip.

289
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,790
‎-他们就跟菲利普一样狠毒 ‎-来吧
They're just as vicious as he is. Come on.

290
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:00,870
‎趴下别动 你的外套就是一个活靶子
Stay down. Your jacket might as well have a target painted on it.

291
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,370
‎我们等着
-We wait.

292
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,830
‎万一这只是声东击西呢
Suppose this is just a distraction?

293
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:09,540
‎好争取更多时间让他带着小薇离开 ‎他就喜欢搞这种鬼把戏
Buying him more time to get away with Vee. It's the kind of game he likes to play.

294
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,500
‎拿闪亮的东西在你面前晃
Danglin' somethin' shiny in front of you,

295
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,830
‎然后他趁你不备 给你脑袋一闷棍
and you don't notice when he's about to bash you over your goddamn head.

296
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,500
‎你会用枪吗
Do you know how to use this?

297
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:26,750
‎我会 我离开他之后去上课学过
Mmm, yeah. -I took lessons after I left him.

298
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,870
‎好的 我得去看一下
-All right, I'm gonna go have a look.

299
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:32,000
‎如果有人离得太近 就用这个
If anybody gets too close, use this.

300
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,000
‎直接戳眼睛 眼瞎的人没法要你的命
Go for the eyes. A man can't kill what he can't see.

301
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,370
‎-你在哪里学的这些东西  ‎-女童子军
-How do you know all this? -Girl Scouts.

302
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,450
‎贾克斯 待着别动
Jax. Stay.

303
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,790
‎这种鬼天气 没人想跟着他过来
All right, no one's gonna follow him in this shit.

304
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,540
‎感觉这又是一次菲利普的蹩脚游戏
I'm telling you, this feels like another one of Philip's fucked-up games.

305
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,370
‎有人吗
Hello?

306
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,250
‎不好意思 我把这里都转了个遍
Oh, excuse me. I'm completely turned around out here. I--

307
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:44,120
‎我在找我家的狗 可怜的小家伙…
I… I was looking for my dog. The poor little guy--

308
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,580
‎-我没看到狗 ‎-好吧
I haven't seen any dogs. Okay.

309
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,370
‎你有电话可以借给我用吗 我只想…
Do… do you have a phone I could use? -I just want--

310
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,370
‎就你一个人
-Are you alone?

311
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,790
‎很不幸 是的
Unfortunately. Um…

312
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,370
‎听我说 我感觉自己 ‎没法再撑三个小时走路回家了
Look, I-- I don't think I can make it the three hours back home, but…

313
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,620
‎不过 要是能歇歇脚就好了
if I could just rest and get my… my bearings?

314
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,500
‎天啊
Christ.

315
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,080
‎好吧 只能待两分钟
-Okay. Just two minutes.

‎早上好啊
Oh, good morning.

320
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,790
‎她的狗跑丢了 被雨淋湿了
She lost her dog, man. She's soaked.

321
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,160
‎只要让我的血液循环起来就好
Just need to get my blood movin' again.

322
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,330
‎天啊 外面的风暴真是厉害
My goodness. Quite a storm out there.

323

‎32年了
-Oh, 32 years.

334
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:25,750
‎不知道这有什么好的

335
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:28,080
‎过来一趟也麻烦 天气又糟糕
It's a pain in the ass to get to. -Weather's shit.

336
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,870
‎得慢慢习惯才行
It's an acquired taste.

337
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,870
‎我就很喜欢这里
I love it, though.

338
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,660
‎我倒觉得是个藏身的好地方
-Good place to hide, I reckon.

339

‎得了吧 托尼 放松点 她只是个老太

355
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,250
‎贾克斯 我是怎么跟你说的
Jax. What'd I tell you about that?

‎在你杀格里之前 ‎他说了关于小薇的线索吗

‎-我们也许能联系到警长 ‎-这种天气就别指望了
-We might be able to reach the sheriff. -Not in this weather.

362
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,660
‎更有可能会引起菲利普的注意
More likely it'll tip off Philip.

363
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:53,080
‎-哪个频道才是… ‎-别跟我争辩 快放下

00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:35,040
‎我需要休息 暖暖身子
I need a break to warm up.

410
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:37,080
‎没时间了 卢
No time, Lou.

411
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,500
‎他也会休息 ‎从他留下的踪迹就看得出来 来吧
He takes breaks too. I can tell by the tracks. Come on.

412
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:00,450
‎该死
Oh, God damn it!

413
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:02,660
‎可恶
Oh shit.

414
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:06,540
‎我不觉得太冷
I'm not too cold.

415
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,200
‎你呢
You?

416
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,500
‎该死
Shit.

417
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:35,120
‎你带伤走了这么久 早该告诉我才对
You walked a long way on that. You should've said somethin'.

418
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,870
‎好让你抛下我不管
And give you an excuse to abandon me?

419
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:50,080
‎-那是给我的吗  ‎-不是
Is that for me? No.

420
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:53,580
‎能给我一点吗
Well, can I have some?

421
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:00,290
‎谢谢
Thanks.

422
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,950
‎你却还是留下了
And yet you stayed.

423
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,580
‎你早就该做点什么了
Well, should've done somethin'.

424
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,200
‎是啊
Yeah.

425
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,290
‎谢谢你 卢 你这番话很有帮助
Thanks, Lou. That's… very helpful.

426
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:07,410
‎我是说你应该早点离开他
Just saying you could've left him sooner.

427
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:15,160
‎你知道跟他这样的人 ‎在一起是怎样的吗
What is it you know about being with someone like him?

428
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:24,040
‎所以或许不要当事后诸葛
So maybe don't tell me what I should have done.

429
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,290
‎我都不认得跟他在一起时的自己
I didn't recognize who I was with him.

430
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:32,870
‎其实 我以为我可以治愈他
I actually felt I could fix him.

431
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,830
‎你知道 我们最初认识时 他很爱我
You know, when we met, he was loving,

432
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:40,080
‎他很在乎我 但他的心支离破碎
he was caring… But so broken.

433
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:51,620
‎过去这么久了 ‎我还以为都是我一个人的错
For so long, I thought… thought it was all me.

434
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,290
‎我以为…
I thought…

435
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,620
‎为什么我会让他失望
"Why am I failing him?

436
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:01,540
‎为什么我的爱还不够
Why isn't my love enough?"

437
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:06,330
‎我不知道
I don't know.

438
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:11,620
‎那个混蛋是个怪物
That son of a bitch is a monster.

439
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,250
‎不管是什么炼狱把他折磨成这副模样
Whatever the hell made him this way.

440
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:20,250
‎反正就算用尽全世界的爱
There ain't no amount of love in this entire world

441
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:22,250
‎都没法拯救他这种人
that's gonna be able to save that man.

442
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:31,160
‎他伤害过小薇吗
He ever hurt Vee?

443
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:36,870
‎没有
No.

444
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:39,620
‎还没有
Not yet.

445
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,290
‎每当他大发脾气的时候
When he would get into his moods,

446
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:47,500
‎我就跟小薇小声说：“游戏开始”
I'd whisper to her, "Game on,"

447
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:49,950
‎然后她就会跑去躲起来
and she'd run and hide.

448
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:57,250
‎我居然把它变成了一个该死的游戏
Actually made it into a… a goddamn game.

449
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,200
‎你说这有多可悲
How pathetic is that?

450
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:09,750
‎他总是说 如果我带走小薇 ‎他就会杀了我们两个
He always said, if I took Vee away, he'd kill us both.

451
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:19,040
‎所以你说吧 我当时该怎么办
Go on… Tell me what I should've done.

452
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:26,290
‎我想我俩都经历了别人无法理解的事
I guess we've all been through things other people will never understand.

453
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:33,790
‎汉娜
Hannah?

454
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:37,040
‎我们会把她救回来的
We'll get her back.

455
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:30,620
‎来吧
Come on.

456
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:38,080
‎该死
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.

457
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:44,040
‎慢慢来 保持平稳
-Slow and steady.

458
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:48,750
‎回家吧 贾克斯
Home, Jax.

459
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:52,370
‎不准跟我争辩 回家 快去
No arguments. Home. Now!

460
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,290
‎见鬼
Oh shit.

461
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,790
‎他到底是怎么带着小薇一起过去的
How the hell did he do this with Vee?

462
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:23,410
‎-得爬过去才行 ‎-该死
Gotta climb around it. Oh shit.

463
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:39,200
‎哇
-Whoa!

464
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:50,790
‎来吧
Come on!

465
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:54,620
‎我扶着你
I got you.

466
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:57,750
‎很好
Good job.

467
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:17,580
‎该死
Shit.

468
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:19,830
‎天啊
Jesus.

469
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:22,370
‎真会挑时候 妈的
Not now. God damn it.

470
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,700
‎-卢 你怎么了  ‎-没什么
-Lou, what's the matter? -Nothing.

471
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,080
‎卢
-Lou!

472
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,660
‎卢

473
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:13,450
‎谢天谢地
-Oh, thank God.

474
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:25,790
‎你让我扶你起来就好了嘛
I can help you if you just let me.

475
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:27,410
‎不需要你帮我
I don't need your help.

476
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:35,540
‎妈的
-Oh, fuck!

477
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,950
‎起来 耽误了一小时 得追上他
Get up. We just lost an hour on him.

478
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:28,950
‎喂 我叫你不要带上这玩意儿
Hey, I told you to leave that behind.

479
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:33,160
‎风暴过去了 ‎我要爬上那个山顶 试着连接
Storm's passed. I'm gonna climb up to that hilltop. -Try to connect.

480
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:34,330
‎没时间了
-There's no time.

‎没人能帮我们 ‎我是你的唯一希望 现在继续走吧
-There is no one who can help us. -Shit. -I'm all you've got. Now keep movin'.

‎-你为什么要帮我 卢  ‎-老鹰湾就在前面
-Why are you helpin' me, Lou? -Huh? -Eagle Bay's just ahead.

我们错过了
We missed them.

486
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,250
‎海浪这么汹涌 人员无法进出
No one's comin' or goin' in water this rough.

487
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:06,950
‎那他打算怎么办
-Then what's his plan?

488

493
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:07,290
‎他这是在捉弄你

494

‎我们可以就这样耗一天

‎也许你说得对 ‎我们可能确实需要帮助

that there are handprints like these in caves all over the world?

513
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,330
‎等你和妈妈还有我都死了很久之后

539
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,370

This is gonna sound a bit crazy,

540
01:01:57,450 --> 01:02:02,250
‎但是我想汉娜道森的女儿 ‎被她父亲绑架了

Don't worry about her.

549
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:39,200
‎我已经确保她会保持昏睡
I've made sure she'll sleep through this.

550
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:42,290
‎告诉我一件事 老实回答
Just tell me one thing. And be honest here.

551
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:45,160
‎你为什么要出卖我
Why'd you sell me out?

552
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:51,750
‎我知道你迟早会找到汉娜和小薇
I knew you'd track down Hannah and Vee sooner or later.

553
01:04:51,830 --> 01:04:53,660
‎我无法永远保护她们
I wasn't gonna be able to protect them forever.

554
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:56,870
‎保护她们 这一切都是因你而起
Protect them? All of this is happening because of you.

555
01:04:58,370 --> 01:05:01,700
‎不是吗 汉娜可能太天真了 ‎她没想明白 但是我不傻
Okay? And Hannah may be too naive to-- to see it, but I don't.

556
01:05:01,790 --> 01:05:03,330
‎汉娜不知道我是谁
Hannah doesn't know who I am.

557
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:12,700
‎你连承认我是你儿子都还做不到
You still can't even admit I'm your son.

558
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,160
‎菲利普 你打算做什么  ‎为什么要这样你追我赶
So what's the plan, Philip? Why the elaborate chase?

559
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:24,700
‎为什么要让我们追踪你  ‎你并不想伤害你的孩子
Why let us track you? You don't wanna hurt your kid.

560
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:28,700
‎你知道吗 那些人把我掳走时 ‎我年纪就跟小薇一样
Did you know that Vee is the same age as I was when those-- those men took me?

561
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:35,160
‎是的 但他们就没有 ‎像我现在这样 对她这么温柔了
Yeah, but they weren't as nice as, uh… as I'm being to her.

562
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:39,950
‎这样的相似程度 你不觉得很巧吗
Can you appreciate that? The symmetry of that?

563
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:44,700
‎我以为我妈妈也会回来救我
I thought my mommy was comin' back to save me, too.

564
01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:48,450
‎那是个陷阱 ‎要是我来救你的话 我俩都会被抓
It was a trap. If I'd tried to save you, they would have had us both.

565
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:50,370
‎胡说 你只想保护自己的卧底身份
Bullshit. You wanted to maintain your cover.

566
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:52,620
‎我只是你执行任务的一枚棋子而已
I was a pawn for your mission. Nothin' else.

567
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:55,410
‎我救了你 我把你从伊朗救了出来
-I had you rescued. I got you out of Iran.

568
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:58,410
‎那你怎么不跟我一起回来  ‎原因很简单
-Then why didn't you come back with me? Here's why.

569
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:02,870
‎因为你他妈的选择了中情局 ‎而不是选择自己的孩子
Because you chose the fucking CIA over your own child.

570
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,750
‎后来事情怎么样
Yeah, how'd that work out for you? Hmm?

571
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:09,950
‎伊朗被你们搞得一团糟 ‎你们还做过比这更糟糕的事吗
I mean, did you guys fuck up anything worse than you fucked up Iran?

572
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:14,410
‎然后 你偷走了我的妻子和孩子…
And then you steal my wife and-- and my kid--

573
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:17,410
‎她们跟我犯的错无关 别牵扯上她们
Hannah and Vee had nothing to do with my mistakes. Leave them out of this.

574
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,580
‎你就别给我上思想道德课了
Oh, spare me the fuckin' morality lesson.

575
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:21,700
‎你早就放弃了这个权利
You gave up that right a long time ago.

576
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:25,700
‎现在还不迟
It's not too late.

577
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:29,790
‎你敢动一下 我就给你一枪
You move, I'mma put a bullet in you.

578
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:32,540
‎现在还不迟
It's not too late.

579
01:06:33,330 --> 01:06:35,500
‎把小薇留给我 然后你走吧
Leave Vee with me and go.

580
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:38,450
‎我会把她们从你的踪迹中抹去
I'll throw them off your trail.

581
01:06:39,950 --> 01:06:41,870
‎菲利普 听我说
Philip, listen to me.

582

‎你说得对
You're right.

583
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:47,200
‎你小时候我没保护好你 ‎现在就让我做弥补吧
I didn't protect you when you were a kid. So let me do it now.

584
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:49,830
‎闭嘴
Shut up.

585
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:51,410
‎怎么 你想杀我
What, you wanna kill me?

586
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:53,450
‎动手吧
Do it.

587
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:58,250
‎你昨晚带走小薇时 ‎我正拿着来复枪抵着自己脑袋
Before I knew you took Vee last night, I had my rifle pressed against my head.

588
01:06:58,330 --> 01:06:59,410
‎我不怕死
I'm not afraid to go.

589

‎你别总是打乱我的思绪 好吗
You just can't stop messin' with my head, can't you?

590
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,830
‎我甚至不知道从何讲起
Kid, I wouldn't even know where to start.

591
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:10,080
‎我知道你把自己炸死了之后 ‎我就知道时机到了
The minute I heard you blew yourself up, I knew it was time.

‎你向来都比我聪明
You always were smarter than me.

‎不是吧

I kept the baby to keep my cover.

‎所以是怎么回事 在玩游戏
So what is this? Some game?

The one who told you about the beautiful secluded place on Orcas Island with the cheap rent?

I blackmailed the CIA to force an investigation into what he did in El Salvador.

-You think you saved us?

694
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:10,160
‎我知道他最终会追踪到你

‎你没有救我们
You didn't save us.

696

‎是我带着小薇离开了他

‎我每天都照顾她 确保她的安全

Now she's out there with him because of you.

You're no damn hero. You're a fucking coward.

‎-这… ‎-那个男人的所有愤怒
-Wow. -All that rage that that man felt.

701

‎他心里燃烧的全部怒火
All the rage inside of that man that he felt,

702
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:29,830
‎撒在我身上的怒气 ‎全都是你一手造成的
that he aimed towards me, is because of you.

703
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:32,540
‎不是每个人都适合当母亲
Not everybody is meant to be a mother.

704

‎但你原本可以更有人性

‎你都没跟她说话 ‎你一句话都没跟她说过
You didn't talk to her. You didn't speak to her.

709

‎你连看都没看她一眼
You didn't look at her.

710
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:02,250
‎什么样的人才会这样对待自己家人
What kind of person could do that to their own family?

711
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:10,120
‎拜托 我们得继续走了

You said the lighthouse. I'll follow the coastline.

715
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:19,080
‎不要独自过去 这是陷阱
Not on your own. It's a trap.

716

‎求你了 至少这件事是我在行的

915
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:24,950
‎简单来说
