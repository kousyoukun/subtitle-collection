00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,550
（维吉尼亚州匡蒂科附近森林）

00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:19,850
《沉默的羔羊》

3
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,980
史达琳！
Starling!

4
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,860
克劳福要见你
Crawford wants to see you in his office.

5
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,930
谢谢
Thank you, sir.

6
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:21,880
（伤害）

7
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,080
（苦难）

8
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,280
（痛苦）

9
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,670
（喜欢它）

10
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,520
-克丽丝　-你好
- Clarice. - Hey.

11
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,250
（行为科学组）

12
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,770
找克劳福吗？
Looking for Crawford?

13
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,210
他快回来了，在他的办公室等一会吧
He should be back soon. Why don't you wait in his office?

14
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,720
（比尔剥下第五个人的皮）

15
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,830
史达琳
Starling.

16
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:03,000
-克丽丝，早安　-早安，克劳福先生
- Clarice M. Good morning. - Morning, Mr. Crawford.

17
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,540
抱歉突然把你召离课堂
Sorry to pull you off the course at such short notice.

18
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,610
你的导师说你是班里的高材生
Your instructors say you're in the top quarter of your class.

19
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,240
希望是吧，他们还没有公布成绩
I hope so. They haven't posted any grades yet.

20
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,980
有一个任务要办，于是我想起你
A job's come up, and I thought about you.

21
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,810
这不是正式的任务，较像一份有趣的差事
Not a job, really, more of an interesting errand.

22
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,250
坐下
Sit down.

23
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,760
是，长官
Yes, sir.

24
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,300
我记得你出席过，我在维吉尼亚大学的讲座
I remember you from my seminar at UVA.

25
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,300
你追问我本局在胡佛年代的，公民权益记录
You grilled me on the bureau's civil rights record in the Hoover years.

26
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,430
我给了你甲等
I gave you an A.

27
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,130
是甲下
A minus, sir.

28
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,070
双主修，心理学及犯罪学，以优异成绩毕业
Double major, psych and criminology, graduated magna.

29
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,970
在瑞辛格疗养院做过夏季实习
Summer internships at the Reitzinger Clinic.

30
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,950
它说你毕业后，想在行为科学组替我工作
It says when you graduate you want to work for me in Behavioral Science.

31
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,180
是的，我很想
Yes, very much, sir. Very much.

32
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,260
我们正在访问被囚禁的连环杀手
We're interviewing all serial killers in custody...

33
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,220
作变态行为的分析
for a psycho-behavioral profile.

34
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,300
对一些悬案会有很大帮助
It could be a real help in unsolved cases.

35
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,070
他们大都乐意跟我们谈
Most of them have been happy to talk to us.

36
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,170
你会否很易受惊的？
Do you spook easily, Starling?

37
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,330
不会
Not yet, sir.

38
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,430
我们最想见的那个人拒绝合作
The one we want most refuses to help.

39
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,070
我想你去精神病院找他
I want you to go after him in the asylum.

40
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,910
那个人是谁？
Who's the subject?

41
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,580
-心理医生汉尼拔・莱达　-食人狂魔汉尼拔
- The psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter. - "Hannibal the Cannibal."

42
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,410
我想他不会跟你交谈
I don't expect him to talk to you...

43
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,620
但无论如何我们都得尝试
but I have to be able to say we tried.

44
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,750
若他不合作，我要如实报告
If he won't cooperate, I want straight reporting.

45
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,760
他的容貌和监狱里的状况如何？
How's he look? How's his cell?

46
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,570
他有没有素描，绘画？如果有，他都画些什么？
Is he sketching, drawing? If he is, what's he sketching?

47
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,060
这是莱达的档案...
Here's a dossier on Lecter...

48
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,210
问卷副本和你的身份证
copy of our questionnaire and an I.D. for you.

49
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,550
周三早上八点把你的报告交给我
Have your memo on my desk by 0800, Wednesday.

50
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,840
好的
Okay.

51
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,490
对不起，为什么这样急？
Excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?

52
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,350
莱达已经坐牢很多年了
Lecter's been in prison for years.

53
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,720
他和水牛比尔是否有关连？
Is there some connection between him and Buffalo Bill?

54
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,660
但愿有，我要你非常留意
I wish there were. Now, I want your full attention, Starling.

55
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:10,330
-知道　-要非常小心应付汉尼拔・莱达
- Yes, sir. - Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.

56
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,030
精神病院的奇顿医生，会给你讲解接见程序
Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over all the physical procedures used.

57
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,080
无论如何不可偏离程序
Do not deviate from them for any reason whatsoever.

58
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,400
你不可向他透露私人事情
You're to tell him nothing personal.

59
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,910
你不想汉尼拔・莱达知道你的思想的
You don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head.

60
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,310
执行你的任务，但千万别忘记他的身份
Just do your job but never forget what he is.

61
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,940
是什么？
And what is that?

62
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,280
他是个魔头，一个变态狂人
Oh, he's a monster, a pure psychopath.

63
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,960
可以生擒一个已很难得了
It's so rare to capture one alive.

64
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:41,190
从研究角度来说，莱达是我们最有价值的资产
From a research point of view, Lecter is our most prized asset.

65
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,040
我们有很多探员来这里的
We get a lot of detectives here...

66
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,540
但我记不起有这样漂亮的一个
but I must say I can't remember one as attractive.

67
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,540
你会在巴尔的摩过夜吗？
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?

68
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,510
如果你有适当的向导，这可以是个很好玩的城市
Because this can be quite a fun town if you have the right guide.

69
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,320
我肯定这是个了不起的城市
I'm sure this is a great town, Dr. Chilton...

70
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,320
但我要见莱达医生，下午还要回去报告
but I must talk to Dr. Lecter and report back this afternoon.

71
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,160
是的，那么我们快点吧
I see. Well, let's make this quick, then.

72
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,930
我们尝试研究他，但他太高深了，一般的测试都不适用
We've tried to study him, but he's too sophisticated for the standard tests.

73
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,360
他很讨厌我们的
Oh, my, does he hate us.

74
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,700
他觉得我是他的报应
He thinks I'm his nemesis.

75
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,830
克劳福真是聪明，他利用你
Crawford's very clever, isn't he, using you?

76
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,480
-什么意思？　-找个漂亮的女郎来引诱他
- What do you mean, sir? - Pretty young woman to turn him on.

77
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,850
我相信这八年来莱达都没见过女人，而你正合他的胃口
I don't believe Lecter's seen a woman in eight years, and you are his taste.

78
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,620
恕我直言
So to speak.

79
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,690
我毕业于维吉尼亚大学，它不是一间仪态学校
I graduated from UVA. It's not a charm school.

80
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,260
很好，你该能记着那些规矩了
Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.

81
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,930
不要触摸或接近那块玻璃，只可传递柔软的纸张给他
Do not touch or approach the glass. Pass him nothing but soft paper.

82
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,900
不可有铅笔或原子笔，纸张上不可有钉书钉或夹子
No pencils or pens, no staples or paper clips in his paper.

83
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,470
只可用那个活动食物架传送
Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions.

84
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,870
不可接受他给你的东西
If he passes you anything, do not accept.

85
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,540
-明白吗？　-明白
- Do you understand? - Yes, I understand, sir.

86
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,510
我让你看看，为何我们要有这些戒备
I'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions.

87
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,790
在1981年7月8日的下午
On the afternoon of July 8, 1981...

88
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,820
他说胸口痛，被带往医疗室
he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary.

89
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,560
为方便做心电图，他的口罩被除下
His mouthpiece was removed for an EKG.

90
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,690
当护士靠近他身边时，他对她做了这个
When the nurse leaned over him, he did this to her.

91
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:25,930
医生们算是重整了她的下颚，救回她一只眼睛
The doctors managed to reset her jaw, more or less. Save one of her eyes.

92
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:31,000
即使在他吃她的舌头时，他的脉搏从没超过85
His pulse never got above 85, even when he ate her tongue.

93
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,170
-我把他关在这里　-奇顿医生
- I keep him in here. - Dr. Chilton.

94
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,320
若莱达觉得你是他的敌人，那么...
If Lecter feels that you're his enemy, then...

95
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,950
若我单独去的话，我们运气可能会好一点
Maybe we'll have more luck if I go by myself.

96
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,650
你认为如何？
What do you think?

97
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,260
你若在我办公室时提出来，就可省掉我的时间了
You might have suggested this in my office and saved me the time.

98
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,830
是的，但我会错过了和你同行的乐趣
Yes, sir, but then I would have missed the pleasure of your company, sir.

99
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,940
她完事后带她出去吧
When she's finished, bring her out.

100
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:36,140
你好，我是巴尼，他说过了，不要走近那块玻璃
Hi, I'm Barney. He told you, don't get near the glass?

101
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,570
对，他说过了，我是克丽丝・史达琳
Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.

102
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,550
幸会，你可以把大衣挂在那里
Nice to meet you. You can hang your coat there if you like.

103
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,910
好的，谢谢你
Okay. Thank you, I will.

104
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,550
他在最尽头的那个牢房
He's past the others. The last cell.

105
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,480
靠右走吧
You keep to the right.

106
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,360
-我放了一张椅子给你　-很好，谢谢你
- I put out a chair for you. - Yes, that's very good, thank you.

107
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,660
我会看着，你不会有事的
I'll be watching. You'll do fine.

108
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,860
我可以闻到你的私处
I can smell your cunt.

109
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,940
早安
Good morning.

110
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,810
莱达医生，我叫克丽丝・史达琳，可否跟你谈一会？
Dr. Lecter, my name is Clarice Starling. May I speak with you?

111
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,950
你是克劳福的人，是吗？
You're one of Jack Crawford's, aren't you?

112
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,510
是的
I am, yes.

113
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,590
可否看看你的证件？
May I see your credentials?

114
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,260
当然可以
Certainly.

115
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,140
靠近一点，劳烦你
Closer, please.

116
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,570
近一点
Closer.

117
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,090
一周内后就到期了，你不是真的联邦调查局探员吧
That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?

118
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,030
我仍在受训
I'm still in training at the academy.

119
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:45,130
-克劳福派个见习生来见我？　-是的，我是个学生
- Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me? - Yes, I'm a student.

120
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,370
我是来向你学习的
I'm here to learn from you.

121
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,830
也许你可以决定，我是否够资格这样做
Maybe you can decide if I'm qualified enough to do that.

122
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,370
你很不老实呢，史达琳探员
That is rather slippery of you, Agent Starling.

123
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,540
请坐
Sit. Please.

124
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,900
告诉我，迈克斯对你说了什么？
Now then, tell me. What did Miggs say to you?

125
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,730
隔壁的“多面人迈克斯”
"Multiple Miggs" in the next cell.

126
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,090
他向你发出嘶嘶声，他说了些什么？
He hissed at you. What did he say?

127
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,370
他说“我可以闻到你的私处”
He said, "I can smell your cunt."

128
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,070
是吧
I see.

129
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,500
我可闻不到
I myself cannot.

130
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,150
你用爱肤恩润肤膏
You use Evyan skin cream.

131
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,530
有时你会涂点香水
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps.

132
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,500
但今天没有
But not today.

133
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,530
这些画是你画的吗？
Did you do all these drawings?

134
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,040
那是从观景楼远望的大教堂
That is the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere.

135
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,040
你知道佛罗伦斯吗？
Do you know Florence?

136
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,950
那些细节都是来自记忆的吗？
All that detail just from memory, sir?

137
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,790
史达琳探员，我只有记忆，没有景观
Memory, Agent Starling, is what I have instead of a view.

138
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,080
你可在这份问卷上，给我们一些见解
Perhaps you'd care to lend us your view on this questionnaire, sir.

139
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:20,730
不...你做得很好
No, no, no. You were doing fine.

140
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,900
你很有礼，而且能容纳礼貌
You had been courteous and receptive to courtesy.

141
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:28,600
你对迈克斯的尴尬说话，也表现得很信任
You had established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs.

142
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,470
至于你这份拙劣的问卷
And now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire.

143
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,110
就不行了
It won't do.

144
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,410
我只是要求你看看它，你做不做随便你
I'm only asking you to look at this. Either you will or you won't.

145
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,310
对，若克劳福要从学校找人帮忙
Yeah. Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed...

146
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,060
他一定很忙了
if he's recruiting help from the student body.

147
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,120
忙于追捕那个新手水牛比尔吧
Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill.

148
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,660
他真是个坏孩子
What a naughty boy he is.

149
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,330
你可知道为何他，被称为水牛比尔？
Do you know why he's called "Buffalo Bill"?

150
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,870
请告诉我，报纸上没有说
Please tell me. The newspapers won't say.

151
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,330
是来自堪萨斯城，凶案组的一个笑话
It started as a joke in Kansas City Homicide.

152
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,770
他们说“这个人喜欢剥他猎物的皮”
They said, "This one likes to skin his humps."

153
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,410
史达琳探员，你认为为什么...
Why do you think...

154
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,340
他要剥她们的皮？
he removes their skins, Agent Starling?

155
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,880
用你的敏锐来振奋我一下吧
Thrill me with your acumen.

156
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,220
这样做令他兴奋
It excites him.

157
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,550
大部分的连环杀手都会保存受害人身上的东西作为纪念品
Most serial killers keep trophies from their victims.

158
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,420
-我可没有　-对
- I didn't. - No.

159
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,260
你吃了他们
No, you ate yours.

160
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,000
把那个传过来吧
You send that through now.

161
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:03,600
你以为凭这份拙劣的东西，便可以分析我？
You think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?

162
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,130
不是！我相信你的学识...
No! I thought that your knowledge...

163
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,700
你很有野心，是不是？
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

164
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,680
可知道你拿着那个高级皮包，穿着廉价鞋子像个什么？
You know what you look like, with your good bag and your cheap shoes?

165
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,310
像个土包子
You look like a rube.

166
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:20,140
一个干净，忙碌，带点品味的土包子
A well-scrubbed, hustling rube with a little taste.

167
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,180
虽然你衣食无忧地成长...
Nutrition has given you some length of bone...

168
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,550
你不外乎是个白种低下层的人
but you're not more than one generation from white trash...

169
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,520
是不是，史达琳探员？
are you, Agent Starling?

170
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,520
你极力想摆脱口音...
The accent you've tried so desperately to shed...

171
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,890
地道的西维吉尼亚州腔调
pure West Virginia.

172
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,160
你父亲是个矿工吗？
Is your father a coal miner?

173
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,030
那盏灯可有令他满身臭气？
Does he stink of the lamp?

174
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,100
我知道那些男孩怎样迅速搭上你，在汽车后座里乱摸
I know how quickly the boys found you, all those tedious, sticky fumblings...

175
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,740
你却想着走出去
in the back seats of cars, while you dreamed of getting out.

176
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,340
走去天涯海角
Getting anywhere.

177
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,150
直走到联邦调查局
Getting all the way to the FBI.

178
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,220
你很有观察力
You see a lot, doctor.

179
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,920
但你能否用你敏锐的观察力...
But are you strong enough to point that...

180
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,690
来分析自己？
high-powered perception at yourself?

181
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,850
怎么样？
What about it?

182
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,230
不如你探究一下自己，把观察所得写下来
Why don't you look at yourself and write down what you see?

183
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,130
或者你害怕这样做吧
Or maybe you're afraid to.

184
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,740
曾经有一个人口调查员想测试我
A census taker once tried to test me.

185
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,350
我把他的肝配蚕豆吃了
I ate his liver with some fava beans...

186
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,850
还有美味的红酒呢
and a nice Chianti.

187
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,030
小史达琳，你飞回学校去吧
You fly back to school now, little Starling.

188
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,400
飞吧...
Fly, fly, fly.

189
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,250
我咬我的手腕...
I bit my wrist...

190
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,490
这样才能死掉
so I could die.

191
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,080
看这些血
Look at the blood!

192
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,390
吓到你了
Gotcha.

193
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,920
迈克斯！你这个混蛋！
Miggs! You stupid fuck!

194
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,070
史达琳探员！回来！史达琳探员
Agent Starling! Come back! Agent Starling! Agent Starling!

195
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,600
我不会让那种事情再发生，我讨厌不礼貌的
I would not have had that happen. Discourtesy is ugly to me.

196
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,240
-那么做这个测验吧　-不做，但我会令你开心的
- Then do this test! - No, but I will make you happy.

197
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,010
-我会给你一个大好机会　-什么？
- I'll give you a chance at your love. - What?

198
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,910
升职，听着，你自我反省一下，克丽丝・史达琳
Advancement. Listen. Look deep within yourself, Clarice Starling.

199
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,380
找出我从前的病人莫菲小姐
Go seek out Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T.

200
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,220
我相信迈克斯不会这么快发作的...
I don't think Miggs could manage again so soon...

201
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,650
虽然他是疯的，快去
even though he is crazy. Go now!

202
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,390
你好，比尔
Hi, Bill.

203
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,830
-爸爸　-克丽丝
- Daddy! - Hey, Clarice.

204
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,650
-爸爸，你有没有抓到坏人？　-没有，他们跑掉了
- Did you get any bad guys, Daddy? - No, angel. They all got away.

205
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,350
该死
Ah, shoot.

206
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,000
联邦调查局，举手，别动！
FBI! Hands up! Don't move!

207
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,710
转过身来，把双手放在后面，好的
Turn around. Hands behind your back. Thumbs up.

208
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,480
史达琳，你已经死了
You're dead, Starling.

209
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:18,210
强生，进入和指挥都做得很好，史达琳，你哪里有危险？
Johnson, good entry, good command. Starling, where's your danger area?

210
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,790
-在角落　-你有没有检查过它？
- In the corner. - Did you check it?

211
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,580
-没有，长官　-所以你已经死了
- No, sir. - That's why you're dead.

212
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,960
3109？
3-1-0-9?

213
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:29,560
打破门或窗闯入或者撤退
Breaking doors or windows to enter or exit.

214
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,830
404号规条呢？
Rule 404?

215
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,670
（巴尔的摩心理医生，获得最高荣誉）

216
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,330
（著名心理医生被控谋杀）

217
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,580
（食人狂魔审讯带来新的恐怖）

218
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,020
克丽丝，你的电话，是教官
Clarice, phone. It's the guru.

219
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,810
克劳福？谢谢，雅戴
Crawford? Thanks, Ardelia.

220
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,760
-史达琳？　-长官
- Starling? - Sir.

221
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,390
迈克斯死了
Miggs is dead.

222
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,500
死了？
Dead?

223
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,690
怎会的？
How?

224
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,490
守卫听到汉尼拔・莱达下午时对他低声说话
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him all afternoon.

225
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,260
他们在夜间巡查时，发现他吞掉自己的舌头
They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his tongue.

226
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,440
史达琳？
Starling?

227
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,020
我还在听，我只是...
Yeah. I'm still here, sir. I just...

228
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,870
我不知道对这件事该有何感想
I don't know how to feel about this.

229
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,920
你不用感想什么，莱达这样做只是为了自娱
You don't have to feel any way. Lecter did it to amuse himself.

230
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,150
我明白今天很难受
Look, I know it got ugly today...

231
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:32,060
但你提到莫菲，有后续行动吗？
but you mentioned a name, "Mofet." Any follow-up on her?

232
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,890
他在被捕前，把大部分病人的病历销毁了
He destroyed most of his patients' histories prior to capture...

233
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,570
所以没有莫菲的记录
so there's no record of anyone named Mofet.

234
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:44,900
我觉得“你自己”这个参考资料，对莱达来说太造作了
But I thought the "yourself' reference was too hokey for Lecter...

235
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:49,310
我想起他是来自巴尔的摩，便翻查电话簿
so I figured he's from Baltimore, and I looked in the phone book.

236
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,780
那里有一间叫“你自己”的自助式仓库
And there's a "Your Self' storage facility...

237
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,450
在巴尔的摩市外围
right outside of downtown Baltimore, sir.

238
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,920
31号仓已经租了十年...
Unit 31 was leased...

239
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,390
租金是全数预缴的
for 10 years, prepaid in full.

240
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,460
合约是以一个...
The contract was in the name...

241
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,430
是赫斯达・莫菲小姐的人定的
of a Miss Hester Mofet.

242
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,260
自从1980年就没有人来过了？
So nobody's been in here since 1980?

243
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,260
以我所知是没有
Not to my knowledge.

244
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,600
我的顾客都很重视私隐权的
Privacy is a great concern to my customers.

245
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,500
对，我答应不会扰乱任何东西
Yes, I won't disturb anything, I promise.

246
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,750
我很快便会离开
I'll be out of here before you know it.

247
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,540
-要帮忙吗？　-好的
- May I help you? - Yes, actually.

248
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,850
这里
Here.

249
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:36,120
-它被卡着　-明天可以叫我的儿子来
- It's stuck. - We could return tomorrow with my son.

250
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,760
他怎么样？
What about him?

251
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:45,070
我本可叫我的司机帮你，但他讨厌体力劳动
I would ask my driver to help you, but he detests physical labor.

252
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,860
是吧
Right.

253
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,130
你别走开，我很快回来
You stay here. I'll be back in one minute.

254
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,430
它被卡着，请你把那支电筒给我
It's stuck. Will you hand me that flashlight?

255
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,590
如果这道门跌下来...
If this door should fall down...

256
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,590
或者有什么意外...
or anything else...

257
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,090
这是我们巴尔的摩办公室的电话号码
this is the number for our Baltimore office.

258
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,190
他们知道你跟我在一起的
They know that you're with me.

259
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,130
-如果有意外就找他们吧　-好的，史达琳小姐
- Call them if anything should happen. - Yes, Miss Starling.

260
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,120
克丽丝，他们在等你
Clarice. Here, they're waiting for you.

261
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,630
小心
Watch your step.

262
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,890
“赫斯达・莫菲”是拼字猜谜吧？
Hester Mofet. It's an anagram, isn't it, doctor?

263
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:38,000
意思是“我其余的东西”
Hester Mofet: "The rest of me"?

264
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:42,340
那表示车库是你租的？
"Miss The Rest Of Me," meaning that you rented that garage?

265
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,310
谢谢
Thank you.

266
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,810
你止血了
Your bleeding has stopped.

267
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,470
怎么...？
How did...?

268
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,550
没有大碍的
It's nothing.

269
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,680
只是皮外伤
It's just a scratch.

270
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,580
莱达医生，那瓶里的头颅是谁的？
Dr. Lecter, whose head is in that bottle?

271
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,920
为什么你不问我，关于水牛比尔的事？
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?

272
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,790
你知道他的事？
Do you know something about him?

273
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,760
如果我看过档案可能知道的，你可以替我拿
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.

274
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:47,270
谈谈莫菲小姐吧，你要我去找他
Let's talk about Miss Mofet. You wanted me to find him.

275
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:53,410
他的真名是班哲文・赖普，是我的前病患
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine...

276
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,580
他的恋爱对象，有点怪异
whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic.

277
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,410
我没有杀他，只是把他藏起来，就像我发现他时的样子
I did not kill him, merely tucked him away, very much as I found him...

278
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,990
在他错过了三次约会之后
after he'd missed three appointments.

279
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,320
若你没有杀他，那么是谁杀？
If you didn't kill him, who did?

280
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,520
谁知道？对他来说是件好事
Who can say? Best thing for him, really.

281
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,200
他的治疗没有功效
His therapy was going nowhere.

282
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,790
他的裙子，化妆...
His dress, makeup...

283
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,800
赖普是个异性装扮癖好者？
Raspail was a transvestite?

284
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:25,670
生活上？不是，只是普通的躁狂抑郁
In life? Oh, no. Garden variety manic-depressive.

285
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,340
乏味，非常乏味
Tedious, very tedious.

286
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,980
现在我把他看成是一个实验
I now think of him as an experiment.

287
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,680
一个没经验的杀手尝试转变
A fledgling killer's first effort at transformation.

288
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,650
你看到他时有何感觉？
How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice?

289
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,950
初时很害怕，后来...
Scared at first, then...

290
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,390
便很振奋
exhilarated.

291
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,220
克劳福在提拔你，是吗？
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he?

292
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:48,120
看来你们互相倾慕呢
Apparently, he likes you and you like him too.

293
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,590
我从没有想过
I never thought about it.

294
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,830
你认为克劳福对你有遐想吗？
Do you think Jack Crawford wants you, sexually?

295
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:59,200
他年纪大很多，你对他可有想入非非？
He is much older, but do you think he visualizes scenarios, exchanges?

296
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,570
跟你做爱？
Fucking you?

297
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:08,740
我没有兴趣，这是迈克斯会说的那种话
That doesn't interest me. It's the sort of thing that Miggs would say.

298
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,290
不再是了
Not anymore.

299
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,520
谢谢你，巴尼
Thank you, Barney.

300
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,400
你的画呢？
What happened to your drawings?

301
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:33,570
惩罚，为了迈克斯那件事，像那个传道节目...
Punishment, you see, for Miggs. Just like that gospel program.

302
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,510
你离开后他们就会调高声音
When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up.

303
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:40,070
奇顿医生喜欢这些折磨伎俩
Dr. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.

304
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:43,110
你说转变是什么意思？
What did you mean by "transformation," doctor?

305
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,630
克丽丝，我在这里八年了
I've been in this room for eight years now, Clarice.

306
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:59,370
我知道在我有生之年，他们都不会释放我
I know they will never ever let me out while I'm alive.

307
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,330
我想要的是一个景观
What I want is a view.

308
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:06,300
我想要一个看到树和水的窗户
I want a window where I can see a tree or even water.

309
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,170
我想去一间远离奇顿医生的联邦监狱
I want to be in a federal institution far away from Dr. Chilton.

310
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,780
你说“没经验的杀手”，是什么意思？
What did you mean by "fledgling killer"?

311
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,740
你是否说他已经再次杀人？
Are you saying he's killed again?

312
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,310
我根据案件的证据，给你对水牛比尔...
I'm offering you a psychological profile on Buffalo Bill...

313
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,610
作心理分析
based on the case evidence.

314
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,060
我会帮你抓到他
I'll help you catch him, Clarice.

315
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,030
你知道他是谁，是不是？
You know who he is, don't you?

316
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,570
告诉我谁把你的病人斩首了
Tell me who decapitated your patient, doctor.

317
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:43,570
愿意等待的人都有好报的
All good things to those who wait.

318
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:48,210
我已经等了，但杰克能等多久？
I've waited, Clarice. But how long can you and old Jackie-boy wait?

319
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:53,950
我们的小比尔一定正在找寻着，下一位特别的女士了
Our little Billy must already be searching for that next special lady.

320
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:01,490
（田纳西州孟斐斯市）

321
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,250
小猫咪
Hey, little cheeper.

322
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,200
我快来了
I'll be right there.

323
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:29,850
天啊！
Jeez!

324
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,620
要我帮忙吗？
Can I help you with that?

325
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,690
可以吗？
Would you?

326
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,090
当然可以
Sure.

327
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:42,630
谢谢你
Thank you.

328
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:45,160
不用客气，你好像是伤残人士
That's all right. You look kind of handicapped.

329
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:49,300
是的，我搬到这里但搬不上货车
Yeah. I got it this far, I just can't get it up in the truck by myself.

330
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,400
来吧，抓着，上！
Here, grab this. Up!

331
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,860
好的
Okay.

332
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,440
把它放下吧，很好
Just set it down. That's good.

333
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:59,410
你上车，我想把它推进去
Get in the truck. I want to push it all the way up.

334
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,780
真的很谢谢你
I really appreciate this. Thank you.

335
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,320
放到后面去
Just go all the way back.

336
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,550
行了吗？
Okay. Is this good?

337
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:10,590
行了，很好
Yeah, that's good.

338
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,790
-真好　-好的
- That's great. - Okay.

339
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:17,170
你大概穿十四号吧？
Say, are you about a size 14?

340
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:18,560
什么？
Sorry?

341
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,580
（十四号）

342
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,120
好
Good.

343
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:03,440
好极了...
Oh, good. Good.

344
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,360
抓着
Holds!

345
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,430
一！
Ones!

346
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,200
史达琳！
Starling!

347
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,050
出去，我们走吧
Outside. Let's go.

348
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:42,810
仙蒂，进场代替史达琳，来吧
Cindy, in the ring for Starling. Let's go!

349
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,960
收拾你的装备
Pack your field gear.

350
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,820
-我们会跟克劳福一起去　-去哪里？
- You're going with Crawford. - Where?

351
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,690
在西维吉尼亚，发现了一名女子尸体
Found a girl's body in West Virginia.

352
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,600
她在水里一周了，看来是水牛比尔做的
Been in the water a week. Looks like Buffalo Bill.

353
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,940
（西维吉尼亚州克莱县）

354
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,810
（联邦调查局）

355
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,790
让她们活上三天，我们不明白原因
Keeps them alive for three days. We don't know why.

356
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:19,080
死前没有强奸或虐待的迹象
No evidence of rape or physical abuse prior to death.

357
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,760
这些伤口都是死后造成的
All the mutilation you see there is postmortem.

358
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,420
三天...
Okay, three days...

359
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,960
然后他开枪射死她们，剥皮和弃尸
then he shoots them, skins them and dumps them

360
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,790
每个尸体弃置在不同的河上
Each body in a different river.

361
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:33,190
河水冲走了证据
The water leaves us no trace evidence of any kind.

362
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,800
那是第一个，费迪嘉・拜姆
That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one.

363
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,840
她的尸体是唯一被他沈下去的
Her body was the only one he weighted down.

364
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,870
实际上，她是第三个被发现的
So actually, she was the third girl found.

365
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,370
继她之后，他变得懒惰了
After her, he got lazy.

366
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,880
好的，我们看看
Okay, let's see.

367
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:53,350
圆圈是那些女子被掳走的位置，箭嘴是尸体被发现的地点
Circles where the girls were abducted. Arrows where their bodies were found.

368
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:58,650
今天这个被冲到这里来，在西维吉尼亚州埃尔克河被发现
This new one today washed up here. Elk River, West Virginia.

369
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,980
史达琳，仔细看看，告诉我你有什么发现
Look at him, Starling. Tell me what you see.

370
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,680
他是个白种男人
Well, he's a white male.

371
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,790
连环杀手倾向于在自己的族群中猎杀
Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic groups.

372
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,990
他不是个流浪者，他有自己的独立房子
He's not a drifter. He's got his own house, not an apartment.

373
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,860
-为什么？　-他下毒手时，需要私人地方
- Why? - What he does with them takes privacy.

374
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:40,500
他年约三四十岁，孔武有力
He's in his 30s or 40s. He's got real physical strength.

375
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,040
还有中年人的自制能力，谨慎而准绳
Combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise.

376
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,310
他从来不冲动，也不会罢休
And he's never impulsive. He'll never stop.

377
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,170
为什么
Why not?

378
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:56,140
他已经迷上了这回事，而且越来越熟练
He's got a real taste for it now, and he's getting better at his work.

379
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:00,650
不错呢，有问题吗？
Not bad, Starling. Questions?

380
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,690
有的
Yes, sir.

381
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:06,620
你没有提及我报告里的任何资料
You haven't mentioned anything about the information in my report...

382
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,260
或者莱达医生的提议
or Dr. Lecter's offer, sir.

383
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,260
我正在考虑中
I'm considering it.

384
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,360
所以你派我去病院
That's why you sent me in there, isn't it?

385
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,730
找他协助缉捕水牛比尔？
To get his help on Buffalo Bill, sir?

386
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,430
如果那是事实...
Well, if that was the case, then I just...

387
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,410
我希望可以早点知道罢了
I just wish I was in on it, that's all.

388
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,780
若以真正目的派你去，莱达会识破的
If I'd sent you in there with a real agenda, Lecter would have known it.

389
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:32,540
他会把你玩弄，什么也不会说
He would have toyed with you, then turned to stone.

390
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,700
（格里殡仪馆）

391
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,880
打扰了，柏金斯警长？
Excuse me, Sheriff Perkins?

392
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,390
这些是联邦调查局人员
These are the FBI people.

393
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:14,690
柏金斯警长，我是杰克・克劳福，这是泰瑞和史达琳
Sheriff Perkins, Jack Crawford, FBI. Special Agent Terry, Agent Starling.

394
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:17,490
感谢邀请我们来到你们的管辖区
We appreciate being invited to your jurisdiction.

395
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:21,000
是州政府检察部找你们的
Somebody from the state attorney's office called you.

396
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,300
我们会通力合作，但现在...
We'll extend you every courtesy, but right now...

397
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,730
警长
Sheriff...

398
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:30,170
我认为该在私底下谈论这类性罪行的细节
this type of sex crime has aspects I'd just as soon discuss in private.

399
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,980
你明白吧？
Know what I mean?

400
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,320
奥加，去教堂叫区医生来
Oscar, fetch Dr. Akin from the chapel.

401
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,950
我们在后面这里
We're back here.

402
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:29,960
叫拉玛弹奏完毕后过来
Tell Lamar to come on when he's finished playing his music.

403
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,600
是的，我们稍后会传过来
Yeah, we'll be sending in a minute.

404
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,630
行了
It's working.

405
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:39,200
我要组成六线联系，芝加哥，底特律...
I need a six-way link up. Chicago, Detroit...

406
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,810
什么？
What? What?

407
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,440
对不起
Excuse me.

408
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,950
对不起，各位警官先生，听着
Excuse me, officers and gentlemen. Listen here, now.

409
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,350
我们要替她做一些事情
There's things we need to do for her.

410
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,060
你们把她带来了这里，她的家人会感谢...
Y'all brought her this far, and her folks would thank you if they could...

411
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,860
你们的善意和体谅
for your kindness and your sensitivity.

412
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,790
请离开吧，让我们照顾她好了
Please, go on now, and let us take care of her.

413
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,120
走吧
Go on, now.

414
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,300
谢谢
Thank you.

415
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:14,800
谢谢
Thank you.

416
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:17,840
很好
Okay, good.

417
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:30,820
是的，埃尔克河，准备传送
Yeah, that's right. Elk River. Stand by for transmission.

418
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:35,890
瑞
Ray.

419
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,170
大家来看看她吧
Doctor, Lamar. Let's take a look at her.

420
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,490
天啊
Jesus...

421
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:17,960
史达琳，行了
Okay, Starling.

422
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:45,360
胸骨上有星形的伤口
Star-shaped contact entrance wound over the sternum.

423
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:49,170
上面有个枪口印记
A muzzle stamp at the top.

424
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,040
-死于非命　-死于非命
- Wrongful death. - Wrongful death.

425
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:55,970
她要被送去克拉斯顿的病理学家那里
She'll have to go to the state pathologist's at Claxton.

426
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,400
我还是回去那个丧礼了
Well, I better get back to that service.

427
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,910
利玛会帮你们的
Lamar will help you.

428
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,810
老天爷
Lord Almighty.

429
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:08,820
你还观察到什么？
What else do you see, Starling?

430
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,390
她不是当地人
Well, she's not local.

431
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,360
她穿了三个耳洞，还有...
Her ears are pierced three times and there's...

432
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,800
闪亮的指甲油，看来是城市人
glitter nail polish. It looks like town to me.

433
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,940
她有两只指甲断了
Two of her fingernails are broken off...

434
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:32,440
指甲下有泥土和沙粒
and there's dirt or grit under them.

435
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,710
她好像想爬过一些什么似的
It looks like she's tried to claw her way through something.

436
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:38,880
瑞，替她的牙齿拍照，稍后传真到失踪人口组
Ray, get pictures of her teeth. We'll fax them to Missing Persons.

437
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,380
好的
Right.

438
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,330
再拍一张
Let's do another.

439
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,100
她喉咙里有东西
She's got something in her throat.

440
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,610
当尸体被捞出水面时
When a body comes out of the water...

441
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,410
口里总会有些树叶之类的东西
lots of times there's leaves and things in the mouth.

442
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,110
那是什么？
What is that?

443
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,870
豆荚吗？
Some kind of seedpod?

444
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:45,920
不，是一只虫茧
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.

445
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:49,160
没可能自己走进去的
There's no way that could get way down in there.

446
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:52,050
除非有人把它塞进去
Not unless somebody shoved it in there.

447
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,720
我们把她翻过来会较易采指纹
She'll be easier to print when we turn her.

448
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,230
帮帮我
Lamar, give me a hand?

449
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,930
好的
Yes, sir, I will.

450
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:08,040
你看这些是什么？
Oh, Jack. What do you make of these?

451
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:11,470
跟其他死者的形状不同，拍几张大特写
Different configuration than the other victims. Get close-ups.

452
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,240
死者的皮肤...
Victim's skin removed...

453
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:16,580
在臀部以上，有两块菱形的皮肤被剥去
in two diamond-shaped sections above the buttocks.

454
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:19,980
伤口跟第二或第三节脊骨平衡
Exit wound level with the second or third thoracic vertebrae...

455
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,990
距离右肩胛骨大约六英寸
approximately six inches from the right shoulder blade.

456
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:24,620
史达琳
Starling...

457
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:29,260
我对那个警长说，我们不该在女人面前谈
when I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman...

458
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:31,060
那令你很气恼吧？
that burned you, didn't it?

459
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:34,730
那只是个烟幕，我要打发他走
It was just smoke, Starling. I had to get rid of him

460
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,700
是很要紧
It matters, Mr. Crawford.

461
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,100
探员们想看你怎样应付
Cops look at you to see how to act.

462
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,740
很要紧的
It matters.

463
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,310
我明白了
Point taken.

464
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:50,510
手腕周围有被捆绑的痕迹
Ligature marks found around wrists...

465
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:52,310
足踝就没有
not around the ankles.

466
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,350
显示死后才剥皮的
This would indicate that the skinning was postmortem.

467
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,340
时间到了，轮到我
Time, Pilch. My move.

468
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:25,380
-不公平，你用食物引诱它　-真无赖，仍然是轮到我
- No fair! You lured him with produce. - Tough noogies. It's still my turn.

469
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,790
宝贝，慢慢来
Nice and slow, baby.

470
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,560
若那只甲虫推动你的棋子，也算数吗？
If the beetle moves one of your men, does that still count?

471
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:35,360
当然算数，你怎么玩的？
Of course it counts. How do you play?

472
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,160
史达琳探员？
Agent Starling?

473
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,260
这东西从哪里来的？
Where the heck did this come from?

474
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:43,260
它粘糊糊的
It's practically mush.

475
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:47,740
在一个被杀死者身上找到的，尸体在埃尔克河里
It was found in a murder victim. The body was in the Elk River.

476
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:49,380
是水牛比尔干的吗？
It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?

477
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,910
我不能透露
I can't tell you any more.

478
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,340
我们在电台听到
We heard it on the radio.

479
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,850
这是一宗真实谋杀案的线索？酷
You mean this is a clue from a real murder case? Cool!

480
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,640
别管他，他是无名小卒
Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.

481
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,750
小角天蛾，可能是...
Sphingid Ceratomia, maybe...

482
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:04,620
它是只大吸血鬼
Boy, he's a big sucker.

483
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:06,760
好吧
Okay...

484
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:08,860
查看一下形态学
let's check morphology.

485
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:20,430
史达琳探员，你不查案时会做什么？
What do you do when you're not detecting, Agent Starling?

486
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,350
做个学生
Try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.

487
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:27,420
你去过吃起司汉堡和喝啤酒吗？
You ever go out for cheeseburgers and beer?

488
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:30,450
那有趣的招牌酒？
The amusing house wine?

489
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:32,480
博士，你是否对我有意？
Are you hitting on me, doctor?

490
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,190
-是的　-找到了！
- Yes. - Gotcha!

491
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:36,250
你找到什么？
What do you got?

492
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:41,330
史达琳探员，这个是阴间冥河
Agent Starling, meet Mr. Acherontia Styx.

493
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:42,690
真奇怪
Weird.

494
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:46,090
认识它的人多叫它做骷髅飞蛾
Better known to his friends as the Death's-head moth.

495
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:47,460
它从哪里来的？
Where does it come from?

496
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,570
这正是古怪之处，它们只活在亚洲
That's what's strange. They only live in Asia.

497
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:53,430
它们是从进口的卵子繁殖的
They're specially raised from imported eggs.

498
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:57,010
有人饲养这只东西，喂它吃蜜糖和茄类植物
Somebody grew this guy. Fed him honey and nightshade.

499
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,970
给它保暖
Kept him warm.

500
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,540
有人很爱护它
Somebody loved him.

501
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:37,480
你在哪里？
Where are you?!

502
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,020
放我出去！
Let me out of here!

503
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,320
喂！
Hey!

504
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:51,930
救我！
Please help me!

505
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,830
求你救我
Help me, please!

506
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:59,570
干嘛你不答我？求求你！
Why won't you answer me?! Please!

507
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:05,810
-各位早，我是唐娜・佛鲁兹　-我是报导体育的金・凯素
- Good morning. I'm Donna Ferucchi. - I'm Gene Cassel with sports.

508
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,920
我是提姆・兰汉，今早的头条新闻如下
And I'm Tim Langhorn. Our top story this morning:

509
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:13,620
马丁参议员的25岁女儿凯瑟琳・马丁...
Catherine Martin, the 25-year-old daughter of Senator Ruth Martin...

510
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:15,120
一度被列为失踪人士
listed as a missing person...

511
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:19,830
相信她已经被称为“水牛比尔”的杀手绑架
is believed to have been kidnapped by the killer known as "Buffalo Bill."

512
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:23,460
孟斐斯市警方说，已确认出该名失踪女孩的衬衫
Memphis police say the missing girl's blouse has been identified...

513
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:28,100
它后面被割破，案情耐人寻味
sliced up the back, in what has become a kind of grim calling card.

514
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,870
凯瑟琳是田纳西州的共和党...
Young Catherine is the only daughter of U.S. Senator Ruth Martin...

515
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,640
马丁参议员的独生女
the Republican senator from Tennessee.

516
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:38,440
虽然这宗绑架案没有政治动机
And while her kidnapping is not considered politically motivated...

517
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:41,550
但政府高层仍然相当重视
it has stirred the government to its highest levels.

518
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,550
正在佛蒙特州滑雪的总统
Reached for comment on the ski slopes of Vermont...

519
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:48,350
接受访问时表示，“极度关注”事件
the president himself said to be, and I quote, "intensely concerned."

520
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:53,150
马丁参议员于较早前，录影了以下的呼吁
Just moments ago, Senator Martin taped this dramatic personal plea:

521
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:57,130
我向挟持小女的人说话
I'm speaking, now, to the person holding my daughter.

522
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:01,700
凯瑟琳是非常温文和善良的
Catherine is very gentle and kind.

523
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,470
你跟她谈谈就知道
Talk to her and you'll see.

524
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:09,640
你有力量，你有控制权
You have the power. You are in charge.

525
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:15,750
我知道你感受到爱和善心的
I know you can feel love and compassion.

526
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:20,780
你有一个向全世界展示的大好机会...
You have a wonderful chance to show the whole world...

527
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,490
就是你是善良而坚强的
that you can be merciful, as well as strong.

528
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,420
你有能力善待凯瑟琳...
That you're big enough to treat Catherine better...

529
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,860
比这个世界待你更好
than the world has treated you.

530
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,560
你有此能力
You have that power.

531
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:36,340
求你，我的女儿是凯瑟琳
Please. My daughter is Catherine.

532
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,630
真是聪明
Boy, that's smart.

533
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:40,270
真的很聪明
Jesus, that's really smart.

534
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:42,440
她不断重复那个名字
She keeps repeating the name.

535
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:47,240
若他视凯瑟琳为一个人而非物件，就难以下毒手
If he sees Catherine as a person, not an object, it's harder to tear her up.

536
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:51,150
求你放了我的女儿
Please, release my little girl.

537
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:55,010
史达琳小姐，你来我的医院干什么？
What you're doing, Ms. Starling, is coming into my hospital...

538
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,780
并第三次拒绝跟我分享资料
and refusing to share information with me for the third time.

539
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,600
这不过是赖普案的例行后续
Sir, I told you this is just a routine follow-up on the Raspail...

540
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,930
他是我的病人，我有知情权
He is my patient. I have rights.

541
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:06,900
我明白
I understand that.

542
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:11,640
史达琳小姐，我不是个笨蛋
Look, I am not just some turnkey, Miss Starling.

543
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:15,000
这是检察官的电话号码
This is the number for the U.S. Attorney.

544
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,510
请你跟他谈，或者让我执行任务，明白吗？
Please, either discuss it with him or let me do my job, you understand?

545
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,220
如果你的分析能帮助我们抓到水牛比尔...
If your profile helps us catch Buffalo Bill...

546
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:31,020
及时救出凯瑟琳・马丁...
in time to save Catherine Martin...

547
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:34,730
参议员答应把你转送到...
the senator promises you a transfer to the VA Hospital...

548
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:38,360
它位于纽约奥尼达公园，可看到附近的园林景色的医院
at Oneida Park, New York, with a view of the woods nearby.

549
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:41,260
当然仍是高度设防的
Maximum security still applies, of course.

550
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,270
你可以阅读书籍
You'd have reasonable access to books.

551
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,270
最好的是...
Best of all, though...

552
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:51,500
你每年可以离开医院一周
one week of the year, you get to leave the hospital...

553
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,050
去这里
and go here:

554
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:58,480
普拉姆岛
Plum Island.

555
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,680
在那一星期里，你都可以在沙滩漫步
Every day of that week, you may walk on the beach

556
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,090
也可以在海中畅泳一小时
You may swim in the ocean for up to one hour...

557
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,890
当然是受特种部队的监视
under SWAT team surveillance, of course.

558
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:11,260
给你的
And there you have it.

559
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:18,270
水牛比尔的档案副本
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.

560
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,640
参议员的建议书副本
A copy of the senator's offer.

561
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:25,140
这个建议是无商讨余地的
This offer is non-negotiable and final.

562
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,380
凯瑟琳・马丁死了你就一无所得
Catherine Martin dies, you get nothing.

563
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:43,320
普拉姆岛动物病症研究中心
Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center.

564
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:46,600
听来很吸引
Sounds charming.

565
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:51,000
那个岛有一流的海滩
That's only part of the island. There's a very nice beach.

566
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:53,470
岛上有燕鸥巢，有漂亮的...
Terns nest there. There's beautiful...

567
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,800
燕鸥？
Terns?

568
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:59,840
如果我帮你，也会是我们的转机
If I help you, Clarice, it will be "turns" with us too.

569
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,140
我们互相交换资料吧
Quid pro quo. I tell you things, you tell me things.

570
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,980
但不是关于这宗案件，是关于你自己
Not about this case, though. About yourself.

571
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:09,120
交换，好不好？
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?

572
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,130
好吗？克丽丝，可怜的凯瑟琳在等着
Yes or no, Clarice? Poor little Catherine is waiting.

573
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,800
好吧
Go, doctor.

574
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,590
你最糟的童年记忆是什么？
What is your worst memory of childhood?

575
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:25,230
家父去世
The death of my father.

576
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:29,200
告诉我，别说谎，我会知道的
Tell me about it. And don't lie, or I'll know.

577
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,410
他是镇上的警长
He was a town marshal...

578
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:38,980
有一晚他遇上两个，从药房走出来的窃匪
and one night he surprised two burglars coming out of a drugstore.

579
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,150
他们向他开枪
They shot him.

580
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:45,050
他当场死亡？
Was he killed outright?

581
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:49,820
不是，他很坚强，熬了个几个月
No, he was very strong. He lasted more than a month.

582
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,970
我母亲在我年幼时去世
My mother died when I was very young, so...

583
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:58,160
自始父亲就成为我的一切
my father had become the whole world to me...

584
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,710
他离开后，我一无所有，我那时十岁
and when he left me, I had nothing. I was 10 years old.

585
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:05,110
你很坦白
You're very frank, Clarice.

586
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:10,140
我相信私底下结识你，会很有意思的
I think it would be quite something to know you in private life.

587
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:13,920
交换资料
Quid pro quo, doctor.

588
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:19,560
谈谈西维州小姐吧，她是否身材肥大？
So tell me about Miss West Virginia. Was she a large girl?

589
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:23,130
是的
Yes.

590
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:25,760
大屁股，肉团团？
Big through the hips, roomy?

591
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:27,300
死者们全都是
They all were.

592
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,200
还有什么线索？
What else?

593
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:33,140
她的喉咙被异物塞住
She had an object deliberately inserted into her throat.

594
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:37,910
还没有正式公布的，我们不知道它有何意思
Now, that hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what it means.

595
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,740
一只蝴蝶？
Was it a butterfly?

596
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,780
是的，一只飞蛾
Yes. A moth.

597
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:49,080
一小时前，我们在班哲文・赖普的头颅内也找到
Just like the one we found in Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.

598
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:51,890
为何他把它们放进去？
Why does he place them there, doctor?

599
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:56,590
飞蛾的特点是转变
The significance of the moth is change.

600
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,940
幼虫变成蝶蛹或者蛹
Caterpillar into chrysalis, or pupa...

601
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:03,360
再变成美丽的蝴蝶
and from thence into beauty.

602
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:06,670
比尔也想转变
Our Billy wants to change too.

603
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:10,640
变性癖和暴力之间是没有关连的
There's no correlation between transsexualism and violence.

604
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:13,580
-变性癖者是很被动的　-很聪明
- Transsexuals are very passive. - Clever girl.

605
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:17,580
你有捉拿到他的本领，知道吗？
You're so close to the way you're gonna catch him. Do you realize that?

606
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:19,680
不知道，为什么？
No. Tell me why.

607
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:24,250
你父亲被杀后你成了孤儿，后来怎么样？
After your father's murder you were orphaned. What happened next?

608
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:32,390
答案并非在那双廉价鞋子上
I don't imagine the answer is on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.

609
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:36,430
我去了蒙大拿州，跟我母亲的表妹夫妇同住
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana.

610
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:38,000
他们有一个牧场
They had a ranch.

611
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:39,970
牧牛场？
Was it a cattle ranch?

612
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,030
牧羊和马
Sheep and horses.

613
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,910
你在那里住了多久？
How long did you live there?

614
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:45,980
两个月
Two months.

615
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:47,670
为何时间这么短？
Why so briefly?

616
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:49,340
我跑掉了
I ran away.

617
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,650
为什么？牧场主人逼你口交？
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher make you perform fellatio?

618
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:55,820
他有没有鸡奸你？
Did he sodomize you?

619
00:56:56,590 --> 00:57:00,080
没有，他是个很正派的人
No. He was a very decent man.

620
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,020
交换资料
Quid pro quo, doctor.

621
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:07,700
比尔不是个真正的变性癖者
Billy is not a real transsexual.

622
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,770
但他以为自己是，他想那样
But he thinks he is. He tries to be.

623
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:12,840
我相信他想做很多东西
He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.

624
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:17,210
你说我有捉拿他的本领，是何意思？
You said I was very close to the way we'd catch him. What did you mean?

625
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,940
有三间主要做变性手术的中心
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery:

626
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:24,310
约翰・霍金斯，明尼苏达州大学，和哥伦布医疗中心
Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical Center.

627
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:27,820
若比尔向它们申请做变性手术，而又被拒绝...
I wouldn't be surprised if Billy applied for sex reassignment...

628
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:31,720
我也不会感到惊讶
at one or all of them, and been rejected.

629
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:33,690
他们根据什么来拒绝他？
On what basis would they reject him?

630
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:39,270
试找寻跟暴力有关的童年创伤吧
Look for severe childhood disturbances associated with violence.

631
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:42,330
比尔并非天生是个罪犯
Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice...

632
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:46,540
是经过多年来惯常的，虐待所导致的
he was made one through years of systematic abuse.

633
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,210
他讨厌自己的身份
Billy hates his own identity, you see...

634
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:53,140
他以为那是令他成为变性癖者的原因
and he thinks that makes him a transsexual...

635
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:57,540
但他的病征要更凶残...
but his pathology is a thousand times more savage...

636
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:59,480
和可怕千倍
and more terrifying.

637
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:06,890
它涂润肤液在身上，它听到指示总会依着做
It rubs the lotion on its skin. It does this whenever it's told.

638
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,090
先生，我的家人会付钱的
Mister, my family will pay cash.

639
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:12,490
无论你要多少赎金，他们都会付
Whatever ransom you're asking for, they'll pay it.

640
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:18,140
它涂润肤液在身上，否则又要挨打了
It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.

641
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,240
是的，珍宝，她会挨打的
Yes, she will, Precious. She'll get the hose.

642
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:26,040
好吧...
Okay, okay, okay.

643
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:28,910
我做吧
Okay, I'll do it.

644
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:30,620
好的
Okay.

645
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:37,120
先生，如果你放我走，我答应不会起诉你
Mister, if you let me go, I won't press charges. I promise.

646
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:40,630
我妈是个重要人物
See, my mom is a real important woman.

647
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:42,760
相信你也知道吧
I guess you already know that.

648
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:45,970
它把润肤液放在篮里
Now it places the lotion in the basket.

649
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:47,540
求求你！
Please!

650
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,500
求求你，我想回家
Please, I want to go home.

651
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:54,400
我想回家！求求你！放我吧
I want to go home! Please! Please let me.

652
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,010
把润肤液放在篮里
It places the lotion in the basket.

653
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:02,040
我想见我妈妈，求你放我吧
I want to see my mommy. Please let me.

654
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:06,480
我想再见到我妈妈，我想...
I want to see my mom again. I want...

655
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:09,220
我想见我妈妈
I want to see my mom.

656
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,460
把那他妈的润肤液放在篮里！
Put the fucking lotion in the basket!

657
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:52,300
你仍然以为可在沙滩漫步，和看鸟儿吗？
You still think you're gonna walk on some beach and see the birdies?

658
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:54,300
不会了
I don't think so.

659
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,630
我找过凯瑟琳・马丁参议员
I called Senator Ruth Martin.

660
00:59:57,910 --> 01:00:00,530
她没听过跟你有任何协议
She never heard of any deal with you.

661
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,970
他们骗你
They scammed you, Hannibal.

662
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:06,980
出去
Stand outside.

663
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:09,940
把门关上
And shut the door.

664
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:11,550
巴尼
Barney.

665
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,960
从没有跟马丁参议员作过协议，但现在有了
There never was a deal with Senator Martin, but there is now.

666
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:23,390
是我议定的
I designed it.

667
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:27,290
当然，我也为自己的利益，定下了一些条件
Of course, I worked in a few conditions for my own benefit as well.

668
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,630
说出水牛比尔的名字
Identify Buffalo Bill by name...

669
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:32,900
如果那个女孩及时被发现
and if the girl is found in time...

670
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:37,370
你就会被转送到田纳西州的丛树山州立监狱
you'll be transferred to Brushy Mountain State Prison in Tennessee.

671
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:40,280
回答我
Answer me, Hannibal.

672
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:43,450
你现在回答我
You answer me now...

673
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:46,680
否则，天啊，你休想离开这个牢房
or, by God, you'll never leave this cell.

674
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,190
水牛比尔是谁？
Who is Buffalo Bill?

675
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:54,220
他的名字是路易斯
His first name is Louis.

676
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:58,190
其余的我只会在田纳西州，亲自对参议员说
I'll tell the rest to the Senator herself, but only in Tennessee.

677
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,870
我也有几个条件
And I have a few conditions of my own.

678
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:05,600
替他梳洗一下，准备出发
Clean him up and get him ready to go.

679
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:09,840
杰克，汉尼拔・莱达正被转送往孟斐斯途中
Jack, Hannibal Lecter is being transferred to Memphis.

680
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:10,780
转送？
Transferred?

681
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:15,820
你可有个见习生，冒参议员之名，向莱达提出一个虚假的建议？
Did you have a trainee make a phony offer to Lecter in the senator's name?

682
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:17,980
是我的主意，我逼不得已
I rolled the dice. I had to.

683
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,290
她气疯了
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.

684
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,350
司法部的保罗・肯度拿来了
Paul Krendler's here from Justice.

685
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:25,390
她要求他在孟斐斯接手
She's asking him to take over in Memphis.

686
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:35,760
（孟斐斯市国际机场）

687
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:51,880
莱达医生，欢迎到孟斐斯
Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter.

688
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:54,710
我是鲍尔探员，这位是派屈克警长
I'm Lieutenant Boyle. This is Sergeant Patrick.

689
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:57,080
我们会像你待我们那么好的
We'll treat you as good as you treat us.

690
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:00,390
你乖乖的，就会得到舒服的待遇
You be a gentleman, you'll get three hots and a cot.

691
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:05,230
长官，请在这里签名，我们作合法的移交
Sir, if you sign right here, we'll have us a legal transfer.

692
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:12,260
用我的吧
Here, sir, use mine.

693
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:00,450
马丁参议员
Senator Martin...

694
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:04,020
汉尼拔・莱达医生
Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

695
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:10,320
莱达医生
Dr. Lecter...

696
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:14,270
我带了一份宣誓书，保证你新的权利
l've brought an affidavit guaranteeing your new rights.

697
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,040
在我签署前你要看看的
You'll want to read it before I sign.

698
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:24,940
我不会为了小利益，而耽误你或凯瑟琳的时间
I won't waste your time or Catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges.

699
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:28,980
克丽丝・史达琳和克劳福，已经浪费了太多时间
Clarice Starling and Jack Crawford have wasted too much time already.

700
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,590
但愿他们没有害死，那个可怜的女孩
I only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl.

701
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,920
让我帮你吧，事成后我会信任你
Let me help you now. I will trust you when it is all over.

702
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:39,430
我答应你，保罗
You have my word. Paul.

703
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:44,600
水牛比尔的真名是路易斯・法兰
Buffalo Bill's real name is Louis Friend.

704
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:49,830
我只见过他一次，1980年4 5月间由我的病人...
I met him just once. He was referred to me in April or May, 1980...

705
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:52,730
班哲文・赖普转介给我的
by my patient Benjamin Raspail.

706
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,870
他们是爱人
They were lovers, you see.

707
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:59,180
但赖普变得很害怕
But Raspail had become very frightened.

708
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:02,880
看来路易斯谋杀了一个流浪汉
Apparently, Louis had murdered a transient...

709
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,410
用他的皮肤做了一些东西
and done things with the skin.

710
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:09,860
我们要他的地址和容貌特征
We need his address and a physical description.

711
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:12,990
告诉我，参议员...
Tell me, senator.

712
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:15,930
你有没有亲自哺育凯瑟琳？
Did you nurse Catherine yourself?

713
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,990
-什么？　-你有没有给她喂奶？
- What? - Did you breast-feed her?

714
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:21,600
-混帐　-我有的
- Now, wait a minute! - Yes. I did.

715
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
令你的乳头变得坚挺，是吗？
Toughened your nipples, didn't it?

716
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:25,140
你这个混蛋！
You son of a bitch!

717
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:29,440
把人的腿切除，他仍感到振奋
Amputate a man's leg, and he can still feel it tickling.

718
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:33,040
告诉我，妈妈，当你的小女儿被杀时
Tell me, Mom, when your little girl is on the slab...

719
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:34,680
你哪里会感到振奋？
where will it tickle you?

720
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:38,980
把这个畜生带回巴尔的摩
Take this thing back to Baltimore.

721
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:42,890
五英尺十英寸，身材魁悟，约一百八十磅
Five-foot-ten, strongly built, about 180 pounds.

722
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:45,730
金发，浅蓝色眼睛
Hair, blond. Eyes, pale blue.

723
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:47,150
他现在大约三十五岁
He'd be about 35 now.

724
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:50,190
他声称住在费城，可能是说谎
He said he lived in Philadelphia but may have lied.

725
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:52,120
我只记得这么多了，妈
That's all I can remember, Mom.

726
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,030
若我再想起什么，我会通知你的
But if I think of any more, I will let you know.

727
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,940
参议员，还有一件事
Oh, and senator, just one more thing:

728
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,070
你的套装很漂亮
Love your suit.

729
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:09,180
与马丁参议员，在今天较早前的会面中
In a meeting earlier today with Senator Ruth Martin...

730
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:13,680
莱达医生同意协助追缉水牛比尔
Dr. Lecter agreed to help in the investigation to find Buffalo Bill.

731
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:15,250
（谢尔比县法院大楼）

732
01:05:16,190 --> 01:05:17,990
-你扮演什么角色？　-我对莱达医生的...
- How do you fit in? - My unique insight...

733
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,120
独特触觉促成了这次突破
into Lecter made the breakthrough.

734
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,480
水牛比尔叫什么名字？
Buffalo Bill's name?

735
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,390
这是目前有关当局的秘密
His name is now a matter of record with the proper authorities.

736
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:28,100
-可否给我们...　-我是奇顿医生
- Can you give us...? - I'm Dr. Frederick Chilton.

737
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:29,900
-怎样写法？　-奇特的奇...
- Spell it? - That's C-H...

738
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:33,500
你是奇顿医生的组员吗？
Are you with Dr. Chilton's group?

739
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,240
我刚在外面见到他
Well, I just saw him outside, sir.

740
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:39,740
不能有太多人接近莱达，我们接到死亡恐吓
Access to Lecter is limited. We've received death threats.

741
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:41,520
我明白的
I understand, sir.

742
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,250
登记和把武器放下
Log in and check your weapon.

743
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:52,950
我不能独自邀功的
I can't take all the credit myself.

744
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:55,460
马丁参议员，司法部，联邦调查局
Senator Martin, Justice Department, FBI...

745
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:59,060
巴尔的摩州立医院的人员，最困难就是...
folks at the Baltimore State Hospital. Now for the hard part:

746
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,030
逮捕那个疑匪
Apprehending the suspect.

747
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,670
对不起，我要赶飞机了
Excuse me, I have to catch a flight.

748
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:10,100
指挥台，我是杰各警员
Command desk, Officer Jacobs.

749
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,450
（路易斯・法兰飞禽，猥亵）

750
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:18,840
（铁）

751
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:22,150
-他们说的是事实吗？　-什么？
- Is it true what they're saying? - Huh?

752
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:25,190
他是个吸血殭尸？
He's some kind of vampire?

753
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:29,620
他们没有替他取名
They don't have a name for what he is.

754
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:32,390
小姐，你知道规矩的吧？
You do know the rules, ma'am?

755
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:35,500
知道，我以前盘问过他
Yes, I've questioned him before.

756
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:39,940
去吧
Go ahead.

757
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:19,410
克丽丝，晚安
Good evening, Clarice.

758
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:23,710
你可能想要回你的画吧
I thought you might like your drawings back.

759
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,350
直到你有自己的景观
Just until you get your view.

760
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:31,380
真是周到
How very thoughtful.

761
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:35,060
还是在你们破案前，克劳福派你来...
Or did Jack Crawford send you for one last wheedle...

762
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:37,560
说最后一次的花言巧语？
before you're both booted off the case?

763
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:40,260
不，是我自己想来的
No. I came because I wanted to.

764
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:47,370
人家会说我们在恋爱呢
People will say we're in love.

765
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:54,010
安克斯岛
Anthrax Island.

766
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:57,150
真是有心思，克丽丝
That was an especially nice touch, Clarice.

767
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,350
你画的？
Yours?

768
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:00,190
是
Yes.

769
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:01,920
对
Yeah.

770
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:04,280
很好
That was good.

771
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:06,420
但我同情可怜的凯瑟琳
Pity about poor Catherine, though.

772
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,760
滴答...
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

773
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:11,660
你的字谜有破绽了
Your anagrams are showing, doctor.

774
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:14,070
路易斯・法兰？
Louis Friend?

775
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:18,000
是硫化铁，也叫做黄铜铁
Iron sulfide, also known as fool's gold.

776
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:22,270
克丽丝，你的毛病是，你要活得轻松一点
Oh, Clarice, your problem is, you need to get more fun out of life.

777
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:25,710
你在巴尔的摩时说了真话
You were telling me the truth back in Baltimore, sir.

778
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,410
现在继续吧
Please continue now.

779
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:30,520
我看过那些档案了，你看过吗？
Well, I've read the case files. Have you?

780
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:33,990
你要缉拿他的资料都在里面
Everything you need to find him is there in those pages.

781
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:37,020
-那么教我怎样做　-首要的原则
- Then tell me how. - First principles, Clarice.

782
01:08:37,390 --> 01:08:40,380
是简易，读马可・奥勒利乌斯吧
Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius.

783
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:44,030
凡事都问：它是什么？
Of each particular thing, ask: What is it in itself?

784
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:45,990
它有什么本质？
What is its nature?

785
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:50,330
你寻找的这个人，他做什么？
What does he do, this man you seek?

786
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:53,130
杀害女人
He kills women.

787
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:56,270
不，那是次要的
No. That is incidental.

788
01:08:56,910 --> 01:09:02,440
他主要是做什么？他杀人是为了满足什么？
What is the principle thing he does? What needs does he serve by killing?

789
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:04,210
愤怒
Anger...

790
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:09,910
社会认同和性困惑
social acceptance and sexual frustration...

791
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:11,020
不是！
No!

792
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,730
他贪图
He covets.

793
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,130
那是他的本性
That is his nature.

794
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:18,960
我们怎样才会开始贪图？
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?

795
01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:22,330
我们是否去寻找贪图的东西？
Do we seek out things to covet?

796
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:24,800
尝试回答吧
Make an effort to answer now.

797
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:27,510
不是，我们只是...
No, we just...

798
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:31,070
我们看见日常的东西就开始贪图
No, we begin by coveting what we see every day.

799
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:34,580
你可有感到一些眼睛在盯着你？
Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice?

800
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:38,680
你的眼睛，又可有寻找你要的东西？
And don't your eyes seek out the things you want?

801
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,750
有的，请你告诉我吧
All right, yes. Now, please tell me how.

802
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:43,390
不
No.

803
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:46,060
轮到你告诉我了
It is your turn to tell me, Clarice.

804
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:48,760
你再没有假期可哄骗我了
You don't have any more vacations to sell.

805
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,930
为何你离开那个牧场？
Why did you leave that ranch?

806
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:56,330
我们没有时间再玩这一套了
Doctor, we don't have any more time for any of this now.

807
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,000
但我们的时间观念是不同的
But we don't reckon time the same way, do we?

808
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:01,040
你只有这么多的时间
This is all the time you'll have.

809
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:03,600
稍后吧，请听着，我们只有五个...
Later. Please listen. We've only got five...

810
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:06,940
不，我现在要听
No! I will listen now.

811
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:11,980
父亲被杀后，你十岁就成了孤儿
Your father's murder orphaned you when you were 10.

812
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:17,050
你去了蒙大拿，跟一些养羊马的表亲同住，之后呢？
You went to live with cousins on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And?

813
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:21,590
我在一个早上跑掉了
And one morning I just ran away.

814
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:25,830
不是的，什么驱使你离开？
Not "just," Clarice. What set you off?

815
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:27,600
你在什么时候出发？
You started at what time?

816
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:29,660
很早，天还没亮
Early, still dark.

817
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:32,440
有东西吵醒你，是不是一个梦？
Then something woke you. Was it a dream?

818
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:33,800
是什么？
What was it?

819
01:10:35,410 --> 01:10:37,040
我听到一种奇怪的声音
I heard a strange noise.

820
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:39,680
是什么？
What was it?

821
01:10:40,350 --> 01:10:41,510
是...
It was...

822
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:44,220
尖叫声
screaming.

823
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:48,450
像小孩的尖叫声
Some kind of screaming, like a child's voice.

824
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,520
你怎么做？
What did you do?

825
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,390
我下楼
I went...

826
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:55,250
走出屋外
downstairs. Outside.

827
01:10:57,530 --> 01:11:00,000
我偷进了壳仓
I crept up into the barn.

828
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:03,460
我很害怕看进去，但又必须看
I was so scared to look inside, but I had to.

829
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:07,870
你看见什么？克丽丝？
And what did you see, Clarice? What did you see?

830
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:10,610
一些羔羊
Lambs.

831
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:13,440
它们在尖叫
They were screaming.

832
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:16,780
他们在宰杀那些羔羊？
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?

833
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:19,080
而它们在尖叫
And they were screaming.

834
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,110
那你就跑掉了？
And you ran away?

835
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:26,150
不是，最初我想释放它们
No. First I tried to free them.

836
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,290
我打开它们的闸门
I opened the gate to their pen.

837
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,930
它们只是站在那里，很困惑的，不肯走
They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run.

838
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:35,630
但你可以走，你也走了，是不是？
But you could and you did, didn't you?

839
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:39,840
是的，我抱起一只羊就拔足逃跑
Yes. I took one lamb and I ran away as fast as I could.

840
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:41,800
你去哪里？
Where were you going, Clarice?

841
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:44,980
不知道，我没有食物和水
I don't know. I didn't have any food, any water...

842
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:47,840
而且当时很冷，非常冷
and it was very cold. It was very cold.

843
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:51,240
我以为...
I thought...

844
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:54,690
我以为，至少可救到一只羊
I thought if I could save just one...

845
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:58,260
但它很重
but he was so heavy.

846
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:00,890
真的很重
He was so heavy.

847
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:10,070
我走不了几里路，警长的车就把我截住
I didn't get more than a few miles when the sheriffs car picked me up.

848
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:17,540
牧场主人很生气，把我送到博斯曼的路德会孤儿院
The rancher was so angry he sent me to a Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman.

849
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:20,280
我再没看过那个牧场了
I never saw the ranch again.

850
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:23,740
你的羊又怎么样？
What became of your lamb, Clarice?

851
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:27,010
他们把它杀了
They killed him.

852
01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:29,650
有时你仍会惊醒，是吗？
You still wake up sometimes, don't you?

853
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:31,580
在黑暗中醒来...
Wake up in the dark...

854
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:35,090
听到那些羔羊的尖叫声？
and hear the screaming of the lambs?

855
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:36,850
是的
Yes.

856
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:41,100
你相信如果把凯瑟琳救了出来
And you think if you save poor Catherine...

857
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,890
可以令它们停止尖叫是吗？你相信如果凯瑟琳活着...
you can make them stop, don't you? You think if Catherine lives...

858
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:48,330
你就不会在黑夜中...
you won't wake up in the dark ever again...

859
01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:51,340
再被那些恐怖的羊声惊醒了
to that awful screaming of the lambs.

860
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:53,910
我不知道
I don't know.

861
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:55,980
我不知道
I don't know.

862
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:00,080
谢谢你，克丽丝
Thank you, Clarice.

863
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:01,860
谢谢你
Thank you.

864
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:04,090
告诉我他的名字
Tell me his name, doctor.

865
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,360
是奇顿医生吧
Dr. Chilton, I presume.

866
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:15,540
我相信你们是认识的
I think you know each other.

867
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:19,340
好吧
Okay.

868
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,100
-我们找到她了　-我们走吧
- We found her. - Let's go.

869
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:24,000
医生，轮到你了
It's your turn, doctor.

870
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:26,070
-出去　-说出他的名字
- Out! - Tell me his name.

871
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:29,110
抱歉，我接到命令，要把你送上飞机
Sorry, ma'am, I've got orders to put you on a plane.

872
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:30,540
走吧
Come on, now.

873
01:13:30,890 --> 01:13:32,680
勇敢的克丽丝
Brave Clarice.

874
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:36,650
那些羔羊停止尖叫时，你会告诉我的，是吗？
You will let me know when those lambs stop screaming, won't you?

875
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,650
说出他的名字
Tell me his name, doctor!

876
01:13:38,990 --> 01:13:40,220
克丽丝
Clarice!

877
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:43,320
你的档案
Your case file.

878
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:46,160
喂！
Hey!

879
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,800
再见，克丽丝
Goodbye, Clarice.

880
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:57,700
医生，准备好就来吧
Ready when you are, doc.

881
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,260
请等一会
Just another minute, please.

882
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:11,520
那个混蛋竟然要再吃晚饭
Son of a bitch demanded a second dinner.

883
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:13,510
还要极生的羊排
Lamb chops, extra rare.

884
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:18,320
不知他早餐要吃什么？动物园里的怪物？
Wonder what he wants for breakfast? Some damn thing from the zoo?

885
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:29,530
（化学喷雾）

886
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:41,380
两位，晚安
Good evening, gentlemen.

887
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:43,510
好的，医生，蹲下吧
Okay, doc. Grab some floor.

888
01:15:43,850 --> 01:15:45,840
跟以前的程序一样
Same drill as before, please.

889
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:54,960
庞毕探员，准备好了
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

890
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:12,740
行了
Okay.

891
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:20,850
递给我吧
Hand me that, would you?

892
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:27,750
谢谢
Thanks.

893
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:33,600
请小心那些画
Mind the drawings, please.

894
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:37,970
谢谢你
Thank you.

895
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:05,070
庞毕，小心，他把我扣住
Pembry, watch it, he's cuffed me!

896
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,200
天啊
Jesus Christ!

897
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,450
庞毕探员，准备好就来吧
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

898
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,760
究竟什么回事？
What is this shit?

899
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,960
有人上了五楼？
Did somebody go up on five?

900
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:53,970
-没有人上过去　-叫庞毕，叫他告诉...
- No, nobody went up. - Call Pembry. Ask him to tell...

901
01:18:57,010 --> 01:19:01,000
CP，五楼有枪声，重复，五楼有枪声
CP, shots fired on five. Repeat, shots fired on five.

902
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,510
戴德警官
Sergeant Tate!

903
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:04,710
去，五楼有枪声
Proceed. Shots fired on five.

904
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:06,940
天啊！
Holy shit!

905
01:19:07,290 --> 01:19:08,950
-怎么了？　-混蛋！
- What the hell? - Bitch!

906
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:10,290
闭嘴！
Shut up!

907
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:11,780
波比，拿避弹衣来
Bobby, get the vest.

908
01:19:12,090 --> 01:19:13,460
是，警官
Right, sarge.

909
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:15,950
-布莱迪，霍华，掩护　-看！
- Brady, Howard, cover... - Look!

910
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:20,300
它停了
It stopped.

911
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:23,230
封锁方圆十幢楼的范围
Seal off a 10-block radius.

912
01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:26,370
召特种部队和救护车来，快点！
Get me the SWAT team and an ambulance, double quick.

913
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:27,800
我们上楼去
We're going up.

914
01:19:56,940 --> 01:19:58,340
庞毕？
Pembry?!

915
01:19:59,910 --> 01:20:01,270
鲍尔？
Boyle?!

916
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:15,650
天啊！
Oh, God!

917
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:23,890
去
Go.

918
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:33,070
-没有人　-没有人
- Clear. - Clear.

919
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:34,670
指挥站
Command post.

920
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:36,610
两个警员死了
Two officers down.

921
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:38,310
-没有人　-没有人
- Clear! - Clear!

922
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:39,970
警官，莱达不见了
Lecter's gone, sarge.

923
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:41,940
囚犯失踪了
Prisoner is missing.

924
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:43,650
鲍尔的配枪不见了
Boyle's gun is gone.

925
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:46,490
重复，莱达持械失踪了
Repeat. Lecter is missing and armed.

926
01:20:46,790 --> 01:20:48,450
他拿走了床铺
He stripped the bed.

927
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:51,650
可能用来做绳，搜查所有窗户
Might be making a rope. Check all the windows.

928
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:54,190
救护车在哪里？
Where the fuck is my ambulance?

929
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,130
他仍活着的
He's alive.

930
01:20:56,330 --> 01:20:59,030
戴德警官，他仍活着！
Sergeant Tate! He's alive!

931
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:02,590
扶着他，抚摸他的手，跟他说话
Get ahold of him and feel his hands. Talk to him!

932
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,170
说什么？
What do I say?

933
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:07,200
他是庞德吉姆，跟他说话，该死
It's Jim Pembry. Now talk to him, damn it!

934
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,440
莱达持械失踪了
Lecter is missing and armed.

935
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:14,410
-庞毕...你听到我吗？　-他拿了鲍尔的配枪
- Pembry. Pembry, can you hear me? - He took Boyle's gun.

936
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:17,750
庞毕发过一枪，莱达可能中了枪的
Pembry got off one round. There's a chance Lecter's hit.

937
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:19,780
继续呼吸吧
Keep breathing in and out.

938
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:23,590
你做得很好，你没事的
You're doing a good job. You look real good there.

939
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:27,090
对，你没事的
Yeah, you look... Look real good.

940
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:45,410
-准备了吗？　-来吧
- You ready? - Let's go!

941
01:21:45,410 --> 01:21:47,110
-我们来吧　-好的，走吧
- Let's do it. - Okay, let's go!

942
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,620
很好，你支持得住的
Looking good. You're gonna make it.

943
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:02,730
没事的
Everything's just fine.

944
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:05,220
-我要作静脉注射　-乳酸林格注射液
- I need that IV now! - Lactated Ringer's.

945
01:22:05,530 --> 01:22:07,800
可否拿那条带子来？氧气在哪里？
Can we get the strap? Where's the oxygen?

946
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:11,700
老兄，情况很好，镇定一点
Doing good, buddy. That's right. Stay with me here.

947
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:15,800
他不行了，去楼下，快点
We're losing him! Downstairs, quickly!

948
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:17,640
抬起！
And up!

949
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:19,970
-电梯！　-这边
- Elevator! - This way!

950
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:22,770
-让开！　-让开！
- Out of the way! - Get out of the way!

951
01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:28,150
CP叫戴德
CP to Tate.

952
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:31,150
收到，我是戴德
Roger, lieutenant. Tate here.

953
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:34,020
我现在乘电梯送庞毕下来
I'm on the elevator bringing Pembry down.

954
01:22:34,630 --> 01:22:36,430
他看来支持得住
He seems to be hanging on.

955
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:39,320
最高的三层楼封锁了
Top three floors secured.

956
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:41,930
主要楼梯封锁了
Main stairwell secured.

957
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:44,700
我们相信他在二楼
We think he's on two.

958
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:00,210
戴德，你听到吗？
Tate, you still with me?

959
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:04,290
我们颇肯定他在二楼
We're pretty sure he's somewhere on two, sir.

960
01:23:04,490 --> 01:23:06,290
通话暂时完毕
That's all for now. Over.

961
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:28,350
他在电梯顶
He's on the roof of the elevator.

962
01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:32,380
好的，大家来
Okay, guys.

963
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:49,930
我看到他
I see him.

964
01:23:50,570 --> 01:23:52,840
他的手旁边有一支枪，他没有动
There's a gun by his hand. He's not moving.

965
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:56,400
-警告，我们要生擒他　-知道
- One warning. We need him alive. - Got it.

966
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:58,800
莱达？
Lecter?

967
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:00,980
把双手放在头上
Put your hands on your head.

968
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,850
向腿射一枪
One in the leg.

969
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:17,460
没有动静
No movement.

970
01:24:18,830 --> 01:24:21,390
约翰，不要开枪，我们要进入电梯
Johnny, hold your fire. We're coming into the car.

971
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,490
我们会打开盖口
We're opening the hatch.

972
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:25,300
小心他的手
Watch his hands.

973
01:24:25,670 --> 01:24:28,440
如果有开火，会是我们发的，确定
If there's any fire, it'll come from us. Affirm.

974
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:29,780
明白
Got it.

975
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,770
孟斐斯医院，这是26号车
Memphis General, this is Unit 26.

976
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:00,610
我们会送来一名五十岁男警
We're inbound with a 50-year-old male officer...

977
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:02,930
他面部有严重割伤
with severe facial lacerations.

978
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:06,510
他全身出现抽搐，情况严重
He had grand mal seizure activity. He's postdictal now.

979
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:08,640
-收到　-重要器官情况良好
- I copy. - Vital signs are good.

980
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:10,470
-血压是130/90　-90？
- Pressure is 130l90. - Ninety?

981
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:12,880
对，是90，脉搏84
Yeah, that's right, 90. Pulse, 84.

982
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:15,450
我们给他注射了乳酸林格注射液
We got him on lactated Ringer's running...

983
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,950
病人正在吸十公升的氧气
and the patient is on 10 liters of oxygen.

984
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:20,250
小心！
Watch it!

985
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:27,960
那辆救护车在孟斐斯机场一个车库里被发现
The ambulance was found in a parking garage at Memphis Airport.

986
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:29,670
工作人员死了
The crew was dead.

987
01:25:30,870 --> 01:25:32,360
他还杀了一名游客
He killed a tourist too.

988
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:34,400
拿了他的衣服和钞票
Got his clothes, cash.

989
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:36,600
他可能在任何地方
By now he could be anywhere.

990
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:38,810
-他不会来对付我的　-真的？
- He won't come after me. - Oh, really?

991
01:25:39,180 --> 01:25:40,200
他不会的
He won't.

992
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:42,370
我不能解释
I can't explain it.

993
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:44,880
他认为那样做很无礼
He would consider that rude.

994
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:47,110
都完了，她已经死了
It's over. She's dead.

995
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:48,980
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

996
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:53,820
莱达说，我们需要捉拿他的资料都在这里，但我不能...
Lecter said everything we need to catch him with is here, only I can't...

997
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,790
莱达医生说了很多话
Dr. Lecter said a lot of things.

998
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:57,820
雅戴，他在这里的
He's here, Ardelia.

999
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:29,360
这是莱达的笔迹吗？
Is this Lecter's handwriting?

1000
01:26:31,570 --> 01:26:35,830
这样杂乱地分布现场，不是有点极度随意吗？
"Doesn't this random scattering of sites seem desperately random?

1001
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:39,770
像个差劲说谎者的精心策划？汉尼拔・莱达
Like the elaboration of a bad liar? Ta. Hannibal Lecter."

1002
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:43,010
“极度随意”，他是什么意思？
"Desperately random." What does he mean?

1003
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:46,110
可能根本不是随意，是有一个模式的
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's a pattern here.

1004
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:50,510
但并没有模式，不然电脑也会发现
But there's no pattern or the computers would've nailed it.

1005
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:53,120
尸体甚至是不依次序被发现的
They're even found in random order.

1006
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:57,120
不依次序是因为那个被他沈下的女孩
Random because of the one girl. The one he weighted down.

1007
01:26:57,730 --> 01:26:59,450
-费迪嘉・拜姆　-对
- Fredrica Bimmel. - Right.

1008
01:26:59,830 --> 01:27:03,060
来自俄亥俄州的贝尔维迪尔
From Belvedere, Ohio.

1009
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:06,800
第一个遇害的女孩，尸体是第三个被发现，为什么？
The first girl taken, third body found. Why?

1010
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:09,160
她没有漂浮，他把她沈下去
She didn't drift. He weighted her down.

1011
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:12,700
莱达说的首要原则是什么？
What did Lecter say about the "first principles"?

1012
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:14,470
简易
Simplicity.

1013
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:17,940
这个家伙做什么？他贪图
What does this guy do? He covets.

1014
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:20,610
我们怎样开始贪图的？
How do we first start to covet?

1015
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:22,510
我们贪图见到的东西
We covet what we see.

1016
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:24,340
每天见到的
Every day.

1017
01:27:26,490 --> 01:27:27,610
该死，克丽丝
Hot damn, Clarice.

1018
01:27:28,190 --> 01:27:29,350
他认识她的
He knew her.

1019
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:38,120
（俄亥俄州贝尔维迪尔市）

1020
01:28:44,870 --> 01:28:46,130
贝先生？
Mr. Bimmel?

1021
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:47,590
我是
That's me.

1022
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:50,560
你好，我是克丽丝・史达琳，联邦调查局探员
Hello, I'm Clarice Starling. I'm with the FBI.

1023
01:28:54,610 --> 01:28:57,770
贝先生，我想四周看看
I appreciate you letting me take a look around, Mr. Bimmel.

1024
01:28:58,350 --> 01:29:00,370
我没有什么新资料给你了
I don't know nothing new to tell you.

1025
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:03,480
警方已经来过很多次
Police been back here so many times already.

1026
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:08,080
费迪坐巴士去芝加哥求职
Fredrica went into Chicago on the bus to see about a job.

1027
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,220
她好端端的离开面试
She left the interview okay.

1028
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:11,820
就没有回家
She never come home.

1029
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,850
她的卧房是原封不动的
Her bedroom's how she left it.

1030
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:18,230
在楼上
Upstairs.

1031
01:29:19,070 --> 01:29:20,430
左边那一间
Door to the left.

1032
01:32:05,630 --> 01:32:09,120
他在替自己做女装，用真的女人做
He's making himself a woman suit. Out of real women!

1033
01:32:09,470 --> 01:32:10,460
他还懂得缝纫
And he can sew!

1034
01:32:10,740 --> 01:32:13,570
他很熟练，他是个裁缝或...
He's very skilled. He's a tailor or a dressmaker or...

1035
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:15,570
-史达琳！　-所以她们都身材肥大
- Starling! - That's why they're big.

1036
01:32:15,910 --> 01:32:18,040
他让她们活着，逼使她们挨饿
He keeps them alive so he can starve them...

1037
01:32:18,350 --> 01:32:19,680
令她们的皮肤松弛，然后...
loosen their skin and...

1038
01:32:19,980 --> 01:32:22,380
史达琳，我们知道他的身份和下落
Starling! We know who and where he is!

1039
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:24,080
我们快到达了
We're on our way right now.

1040
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:27,150
-哪里？　-芝加哥卡柳梅特城
- Where? - Calumet City, edge of Chicago.

1041
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,990
我45分钟后会和飞虎队降落
Be on the ground in 45 minutes with HRT.

1042
01:32:30,290 --> 01:32:32,380
好消息，但怎么...
That's great news, sir. But how...?

1043
01:32:32,690 --> 01:32:36,150
我们把约翰・霍金斯提供的名字，输入已知犯人的档案
We fed the names Johns Hopkins came up with into Known Offenders.

1044
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:40,260
他叫杰米・甘姆，又名约翰・格兰
Subject's name is Jamie Gumb, a.k.a. John Grant.

1045
01:32:40,630 --> 01:32:44,200
莱达的描述是正确的，他只是捏造那个名字
Lecter's description was accurate. He just lied about the name.

1046
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:45,870
海关有些关于他的资料
Customs had some paper on him.

1047
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:49,840
两年前他们在洛杉矶机场，查到一个纸箱
They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX.

1048
01:32:50,110 --> 01:32:52,100
是一些来自苏里南的活毛虫
Live caterpillars from Suriname.

1049
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:55,210
收件人叫詹米・甘姆
The addressee was a Jame Gumb.

1050
01:32:55,950 --> 01:32:58,680
芝加哥离这里只有四百哩，我很快...
Chicago is only 400 miles from here. I'll be there in...

1051
01:32:59,050 --> 01:33:00,610
不，没有时间了
No, there's not enough time.

1052
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:03,050
我们要控告他谋杀，不是绑架
We want him for murder, not kidnapping.

1053
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,520
在起诉他前，要找出他与费迪嘉・拜姆的关系
Link him to Bimmel before he's indicted.

1054
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:09,790
-你去贝尔维迪尔看有什么发现　-知道，我会尽力的
- See what you can find in Belvedere. - Yes, sir. You bet. I'll do my best.

1055
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:11,160
史达琳
Starling.

1056
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:15,160
没有你我们就找不到他，大家都会记着这点
We wouldn't have found him without you. Nobody will forget that.

1057
01:33:16,070 --> 01:33:17,540
尤其是我
Least of all me.

1058
01:33:18,740 --> 01:33:19,800
谢谢，长官
Thank you, sir.

1059
01:33:20,110 --> 01:33:22,340
谢谢你，葛先生
Thank you very much, Mr. Crawford.

1060
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:25,040
葛先生？
Mr. Crawford?

1061
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:39,850
混蛋，谢谢那些冷饭菜汁
Thanks for the scraps, asshole.

1062
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:42,020
我有更好的主意
I got a better idea.

1063
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:06,070
珍宝，我来招呼你吧
Okay, Precious. Time for a little treat.

1064
01:34:19,170 --> 01:34:20,530
珍宝
Precious!

1065
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,630
乖乖，来吧
Come on, girl!

1066
01:34:25,770 --> 01:34:28,170
来吧，珍宝，乖
Come on, Precious. Come on, Precious.

1067
01:34:37,550 --> 01:34:39,140
来吧，珍宝
Come on, Precious.

1068
01:34:39,490 --> 01:34:42,180
我有好吃的点心给你
I got a yummy, yummy snack for you.

1069
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:43,720
来吃吧
Come and get it!

1070
01:34:50,830 --> 01:34:52,160
珍宝
Precious!
