《沈默的羔羊》

3
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,980
史達琳！
Starling!

4
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,860
克勞福要見你
Crawford wants to see you in his office.

5
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,930
謝謝
Thank you, sir.

6
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:21,880
（傷害）

7
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,080
（苦難）

8
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,280
（痛苦）

9
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,670
（喜歡它）

10
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,520
-克麗絲　-你好
- Clarice. - Hey.

11
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,250
（行為科學組）

12
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,770
找克勞福嗎？
Looking for Crawford?

13
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,210
他快回來了，在他的辦公室等一會吧
He should be back soon. Why don't you wait in his office?

14
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,720
（比爾剝下第五個人的皮）

15
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,830
史達琳
Starling.

16
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:03,000
-克麗絲，早安　-早安，克勞福先生
- Clarice M. Good morning. - Morning, Mr. Crawford.

17
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,540
抱歉突然把你召離課堂
Sorry to pull you off the course at such short notice.

18
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,610
你的導師說你是班裡的高材生
Your instructors say you're in the top quarter of your class.

19
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,240
希望是吧，他們還沒有公佈成績
I hope so. They haven't posted any grades yet.

20
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,980
有一個任務要辦，於是我想起你
A job's come up, and I thought about you.

21
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,810
這不是正式的任務，較像一份有趣的差事
Not a job, really, more of an interesting errand.

22
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,250
坐下
Sit down.

23
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,760
是，長官
Yes, sir.

24
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,300
我記得你出席過，我在維吉尼亞大學的講座
I remember you from my seminar at UVA.

25
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,300
你追問我本局在胡佛年代的，公民權益記錄
You grilled me on the bureau's civil rights record in the Hoover years.

26
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,430
我給了你甲等
I gave you an A.

27
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,130
是甲下
A minus, sir.

28
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,070
雙主修，心理學及犯罪學，以優異成績畢業
Double major, psych and criminology, graduated magna.

29
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,970
在瑞辛格療養院做過夏季實習
Summer internships at the Reitzinger Clinic.

30
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,950
它說你畢業後，想在行為科學組替我工作
It says when you graduate you want to work for me in Behavioral Science.

31
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,180
是的，我很想
Yes, very much, sir. Very much.

32
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,260
我們正在訪問被囚禁的連環殺手
We're interviewing all serial killers in custody...

33
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,220
作變態行為的分析
for a psycho-behavioral profile.

34
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,300
對一些懸案會有很大幫助
It could be a real help in unsolved cases.

35
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,070
他們大都樂意跟我們談
Most of them have been happy to talk to us.

36
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,170
你會否很易受驚的？
Do you spook easily, Starling?

37
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,330
不會
Not yet, sir.

38
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,430
我們最想見的那個人拒絕合作
The one we want most refuses to help.

39
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,070
我想你去精神病院找他
I want you to go after him in the asylum.

40
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,910
那個人是誰？
Who's the subject?

41
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,580
-心理醫生漢尼拔・萊達　-食人狂魔漢尼拔
- The psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter. - "Hannibal the Cannibal."

42
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,410
我想他不會跟你交談
I don't expect him to talk to you...

43
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,620
但無論如何我們都得嘗試
but I have to be able to say we tried.

44
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,750
若他不合作，我要如實報告
If he won't cooperate, I want straight reporting.

45
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,760
他的容貌和監獄里的狀況如何？
How's he look? How's his cell?

46
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,570
他有沒有素描，繪畫？如果有，他都畫些什麼？
Is he sketching, drawing? If he is, what's he sketching?

47
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,060
這是萊達的檔案...
Here's a dossier on Lecter...

48
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,210
問卷副本和你的身份證
copy of our questionnaire and an I.D. for you.

49
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,550
週三早上八點把你的報告交給我
Have your memo on my desk by 0800, Wednesday.

50
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,840
好的
Okay.

51
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,490
對不起，為什麼這樣急？
Excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?

52
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,350
萊達已經坐牢很多年了
Lecter's been in prison for years.

53
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,720
他和水牛比爾是否有關連？
Is there some connection between him and Buffalo Bill?

54
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,660
但願有，我要你非常留意
I wish there were. Now, I want your full attention, Starling.

55
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:10,330
-知道　-要非常小心應付漢尼拔・萊達
- Yes, sir. - Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.

56
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,030
精神病院的奇頓醫生，會給你講解接見程序
Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over all the physical procedures used.

57
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,080
無論如何不可偏離程序
Do not deviate from them for any reason whatsoever.

58
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,400
你不可向他透露私人事情
You're to tell him nothing personal.

59
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,910
你不想漢尼拔・萊達知道你的思想的
You don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head.

60
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,310
執行你的任務，但千萬別忘記他的身份
Just do your job but never forget what he is.

61
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,940
是什麼？
And what is that?

62
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,280
他是個魔頭，一個變態狂人
Oh, he's a monster, a pure psychopath.

63
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,960
可以生擒一個已很難得了
It's so rare to capture one alive.

64
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:41,190
從研究角度來說，萊達是我們最有價值的資產
From a research point of view, Lecter is our most prized asset.

65
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,040
我們有很多探員來這裡的
We get a lot of detectives here...

66
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,540
但我記不起有這樣漂亮的一個
but I must say I can't remember one as attractive.

67
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,540
你會在巴爾的摩過夜嗎？
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?

68
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,510
如果你有適當的嚮導，這可以是個很好玩的城市
Because this can be quite a fun town if you have the right guide.

69
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,320
我肯定這是個了不起的城市
I'm sure this is a great town, Dr. Chilton...

70
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,320
但我要見萊達醫生，下午還要回去報告
but I must talk to Dr. Lecter and report back this afternoon.

71
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,160
是的，那麼我們快點吧
I see. Well, let's make this quick, then.

72
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,930
我們嘗試研究他，但他太高深了，一般的測試都不適用
We've tried to study him, but he's too sophisticated for the standard tests.

73
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,360
他很討厭我們的
Oh, my, does he hate us.

74
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,700
他覺得我是他的報應
He thinks I'm his nemesis.

75
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,830
克勞福真是聰明，他利用你
Crawford's very clever, isn't he, using you?

76
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,480
-什麼意思？　-找個漂亮的女郎來引誘他
- What do you mean, sir? - Pretty young woman to turn him on.

77
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,850
我相信這八年來萊達都沒見過女人，而你正合他的胃口
I don't believe Lecter's seen a woman in eight years, and you are his taste.

78
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,620
恕我直言
So to speak.

79
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,690
我畢業於維吉尼亞大學，它不是一間儀態學校
I graduated from UVA. It's not a charm school.

80
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,260
很好，你該能記著那些規矩了
Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.

81
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,930
不要觸摸或接近那塊玻璃，只可傳遞柔軟的紙張給他
Do not touch or approach the glass. Pass him nothing but soft paper.

82
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,900
不可有鉛筆或原子筆，紙張上不可有釘書釘或夾子
No pencils or pens, no staples or paper clips in his paper.

83
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,470
只可用那個活動食物架傳送
Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions.

84
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,870
不可接受他給你的東西
If he passes you anything, do not accept.

85
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,540
-明白嗎？　-明白
- Do you understand? - Yes, I understand, sir.

86
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,510
我讓你看看，為何我們要有這些戒備
I'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions.

87
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,790
在1981年7月8日的下午
On the afternoon of July 8, 1981...

88
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,820
他說胸口痛，被帶往醫療室
he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary.

89
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,560
為方便做心電圖，他的口罩被除下
His mouthpiece was removed for an EKG.

90
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,690
當護士靠近他身邊時，他對她做了這個
When the nurse leaned over him, he did this to her.

91
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:25,930
醫生們算是重整了她的下顎，救回她一隻眼睛
The doctors managed to reset her jaw, more or less. Save one of her eyes.

92
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:31,000
即使在他吃她的舌頭時，他的脈搏從沒超過85
His pulse never got above 85, even when he ate her tongue.

93
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,170
-我把他關在這裡　-奇頓醫生
- I keep him in here. - Dr. Chilton.

94
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,320
若萊達覺得你是他的敵人，那麼...
If Lecter feels that you're his enemy, then...

95
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,950
若我單獨去的話，我們運氣可能會好一點
Maybe we'll have more luck if I go by myself.

96
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,650
你認為如何？
What do you think?

97
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,260
你若在我辦公室時提出來，就可省掉我的時間了
You might have suggested this in my office and saved me the time.

98
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,830
是的，但我會錯過了和你同行的樂趣
Yes, sir, but then I would have missed the pleasure of your company, sir.

99
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,940
她完事後帶她出去吧
When she's finished, bring her out.

100
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:36,140
你好，我是巴尼，他說過了，不要走近那塊玻璃
Hi, I'm Barney. He told you, don't get near the glass?

101
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,570
對，他說過了，我是克麗絲・史達琳
Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.

102
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,550
幸會，你可以把大衣掛在那裡
Nice to meet you. You can hang your coat there if you like.

103
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,910
好的，謝謝你
Okay. Thank you, I will.

104
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,550
他在最盡頭的那個牢房
He's past the others. The last cell.

105
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,480
靠右走吧
You keep to the right.

106
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,360
-我放了一張椅子給你　-很好，謝謝你
- I put out a chair for you. - Yes, that's very good, thank you.

107
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,660
我會看著，你不會有事的
I'll be watching. You'll do fine.

108
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,860
我可以聞到你的私處
I can smell your cunt.

109
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,940
早安
Good morning.

110
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,810
萊達醫生，我叫克麗絲・史達琳，可否跟你談一會？
Dr. Lecter, my name is Clarice Starling. May I speak with you?

111
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,950
你是克勞福的人，是嗎？
You're one of Jack Crawford's, aren't you?

112
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,510
是的
I am, yes.

113
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,590
可否看看你的證件？
May I see your credentials?

114
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,260
當然可以
Certainly.

115
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,140
靠近一點，勞煩你
Closer, please.

116
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,570
近一點
Closer.

117
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,090
一周內後就到期了，你不是真的聯邦調查局探員吧
That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?

118
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,030
我仍在受訓
I'm still in training at the academy.

119
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:45,130
-克勞福派個見習生來見我？　-是的，我是個學生
- Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me? - Yes, I'm a student.

120
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,370
我是來向你學習的
I'm here to learn from you.

121
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,830
也許你可以決定，我是否夠資格這樣做
Maybe you can decide if I'm qualified enough to do that.

122
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,370
你很不老實呢，史達琳探員
That is rather slippery of you, Agent Starling.

123
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,540
請坐
Sit. Please.

124
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,900
告訴我，邁克斯對你說了什麼？
Now then, tell me. What did Miggs say to you?

125
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,730
隔壁的「多面人邁克斯」
"Multiple Miggs" in the next cell.

126
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,090
他向你發出嘶嘶聲，他說了些什麼？
He hissed at you. What did he say?

127
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,370
他說「我可以聞到你的私處」
He said, "I can smell your cunt."

128
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,070
是吧
I see.

129
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,500
我可聞不到
I myself cannot.

130
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,150
你用愛膚恩潤膚膏
You use Evyan skin cream.

131
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,530
有時你會塗點香水
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps.

132
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,500
但今天沒有
But not today.

133
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,530
這些畫是你畫的嗎？
Did you do all these drawings?

134
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,040
那是從觀景樓遠望的大教堂
That is the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere.

135
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,040
你知道佛羅倫斯嗎？
Do you know Florence?

136
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,950
那些細節都是來自記憶的嗎？
All that detail just from memory, sir?

137
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,790
史達琳探員，我只有記憶，沒有景觀
Memory, Agent Starling, is what I have instead of a view.

138
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,080
你可在這份問卷上，給我們一些見解
Perhaps you'd care to lend us your view on this questionnaire, sir.

139
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:20,730
不...你做得很好
No, no, no. You were doing fine.

140
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,900
你很有禮，而且能容納禮貌
You had been courteous and receptive to courtesy.

141
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:28,600
你對邁克斯的尷尬說話，也表現得很信任
You had established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs.

142
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,470
至於你這份拙劣的問卷
And now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire.

143
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,110
就不行了
It won't do.

144
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,410
我只是要求你看看它，你做不做隨便你
I'm only asking you to look at this. Either you will or you won't.

145
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,310
對，若克勞福要從學校找人幫忙
Yeah. Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed...

146
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,060
他一定很忙了
if he's recruiting help from the student body.

147
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,120
忙於追捕那個新手水牛比爾吧
Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill.

148
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,660
他真是個壞孩子
What a naughty boy he is.

149
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,330
你可知道為何他，被稱為水牛比爾？
Do you know why he's called "Buffalo Bill"?

150
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,870
請告訴我，報紙上沒有說
Please tell me. The newspapers won't say.

151
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,330
是來自堪薩斯城，凶案組的一個笑話
It started as a joke in Kansas City Homicide.

152
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,770
他們說「這個人喜歡剝他獵物的皮」
They said, "This one likes to skin his humps."

153
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,410
史達琳探員，你認為為什麼...
Why do you think...

154
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,340
他要剝她們的皮？
he removes their skins, Agent Starling?

155
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,880
用你的敏銳來振奮我一下吧
Thrill me with your acumen.

156
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,220
這樣做令他興奮
It excites him.

157
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,550
大部分的連環殺手都會保存受害人身上的東西作為紀念品
Most serial killers keep trophies from their victims.

158
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,420
-我可沒有　-對
- I didn't. - No.

159
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,260
你吃了他們
No, you ate yours.

160
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,000
把那個傳過來吧
You send that through now.

161
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:03,600
你以為憑這份拙劣的東西，便可以分析我？
You think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?

162
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,130
不是！我相信你的學識...
No! I thought that your knowledge...

163
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,700
你很有野心，是不是？
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

164
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,680
可知道你拿著那個高級皮包，穿著廉價鞋子像個什麼？
You know what you look like, with your good bag and your cheap shoes?

165
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,310
像個土包子
You look like a rube.

166
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:20,140
一個乾淨，忙碌，帶點品味的土包子
A well-scrubbed, hustling rube with a little taste.

167
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,180
雖然你衣食無憂地成長...
Nutrition has given you some length of bone...

168
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,550
你不外乎是個白種低下層的人
but you're not more than one generation from white trash...

169
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,520
是不是，史達琳探員？
are you, Agent Starling?

170
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,520
你極力想擺脫口音...
The accent you've tried so desperately to shed...

171
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,890
地道的西維吉尼亞州腔調
pure West Virginia.

172
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,160
你父親是個礦工嗎？
Is your father a coal miner?

173
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,030
那盞燈可有令他滿身臭氣？
Does he stink of the lamp?

174
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,100
我知道那些男孩怎樣迅速搭上你，在汽車後座里亂摸
I know how quickly the boys found you, all those tedious, sticky fumblings...

175
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,740
你卻想著走出去
in the back seats of cars, while you dreamed of getting out.

176
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,340
走去天涯海角
Getting anywhere.

177
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,150
直走到聯邦調查局
Getting all the way to the FBI.

178
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,220
你很有觀察力
You see a lot, doctor.

179
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,920
但你能否用你敏銳的觀察力...
But are you strong enough to point that...

180
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,690
來分析自己？
high-powered perception at yourself?

181
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,850
怎麼樣？
What about it?

182
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,230
不如你探究一下自己，把觀察所得寫下來
Why don't you look at yourself and write down what you see?

183
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,130
或者你害怕這樣做吧
Or maybe you're afraid to.

184
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,740
曾經有一個人口調查員想測試我
A census taker once tried to test me.

185
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,350
我把他的肝配蠶豆吃了
I ate his liver with some fava beans...

186
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,850
還有美味的紅酒呢
and a nice Chianti.

187
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,030
小史達琳，你飛回學校去吧
You fly back to school now, little Starling.

188
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,400
飛吧...
Fly, fly, fly.

189
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,250
我咬我的手腕...
I bit my wrist...

190
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,490
這樣才能死掉
so I could die.

191
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,080
看這些血
Look at the blood!

192
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,390
嚇到你了
Gotcha.

193
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,920
邁克斯！你這個混蛋！
Miggs! You stupid fuck!

194
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,070
史達琳探員！回來！史達琳探員
Agent Starling! Come back! Agent Starling! Agent Starling!

195
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,600
我不會讓那種事情再發生，我討厭不禮貌的
I would not have had that happen. Discourtesy is ugly to me.

196
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,240
-那麼做這個測驗吧　-不做，但我會令你開心的
- Then do this test! - No, but I will make you happy.

197
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,010
-我會給你一個大好機會　-什麼？
- I'll give you a chance at your love. - What?

198
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,910
升職，聽著，你自我反省一下，克麗絲・史達琳
Advancement. Listen. Look deep within yourself, Clarice Starling.

199
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,380
找出我從前的病人莫菲小姐
Go seek out Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T.

200
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,220
我相信邁克斯不會這麼快發作的...
I don't think Miggs could manage again so soon...

201
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,650
雖然他是瘋的，快去
even though he is crazy. Go now!

202
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,390
你好，比爾
Hi, Bill.

203
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,830
-爸爸　-克麗絲
- Daddy! - Hey, Clarice.

204
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,650
-爸爸，你有沒有抓到壞人？　-沒有，他們跑掉了
- Did you get any bad guys, Daddy? - No, angel. They all got away.

205
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,350
該死
Ah, shoot.

206
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,000
聯邦調查局，舉手，別動！
FBI! Hands up! Don't move!

207
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,710
轉過身來，把雙手放在後面，好的
Turn around. Hands behind your back. Thumbs up.

208
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,480
史達琳，你已經死了
You're dead, Starling.

209
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:18,210
強生，進入和指揮都做得很好，史達琳，你哪裡有危險？
Johnson, good entry, good command. Starling, where's your danger area?

210
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,790
-在角落　-你有沒有檢查過它？
- In the corner. - Did you check it?

211
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,580
-沒有，長官　-所以你已經死了
- No, sir. - That's why you're dead.

212
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,960
3109？
3-1-0-9?

213
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:29,560
打破門或窗闖入或者撤退
Breaking doors or windows to enter or exit.

214
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,830
404號規條呢？
Rule 404?

215
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,670
（巴爾的摩心理醫生，獲得最高榮譽）

216
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,330
（著名心理醫生被控謀殺）

217
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,580
（食人狂魔審訊帶來新的恐怖）

218
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,020
克麗絲，你的電話，是教官
Clarice, phone. It's the guru.

219
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,810
克勞福？謝謝，雅戴
Crawford? Thanks, Ardelia.

220
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,760
-史達琳？　-長官
- Starling? - Sir.

221
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,390
邁克斯死了
Miggs is dead.

222
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,500
死了？
Dead?

223
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,690
怎會的？
How?

224
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,490
守衛聽到漢尼拔・萊達下午時對他低聲說話
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him all afternoon.

225
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,260
他們在夜間巡查時，發現他吞掉自己的舌頭
They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his tongue.

226
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,440
史達琳？
Starling?

227
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,020
我還在聽，我只是...
Yeah. I'm still here, sir. I just...

228
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,870
我不知道對這件事該有何感想
I don't know how to feel about this.

229
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,920
你不用感想什麼，萊達這樣做只是為了自娛
You don't have to feel any way. Lecter did it to amuse himself.

230
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,150
我明白今天很難受
Look, I know it got ugly today...

231
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:32,060
但你提到莫菲，有後續行動嗎？
but you mentioned a name, "Mofet." Any follow-up on her?

232
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,890
他在被捕前，把大部分病人的病歷銷毀了
He destroyed most of his patients' histories prior to capture...

233
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,570
所以沒有莫菲的記錄
so there's no record of anyone named Mofet.

234
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:44,900
我覺得「你自己」這個參考資料，對萊達來說太造作了
But I thought the "yourself' reference was too hokey for Lecter...

235
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:49,310
我想起他是來自巴爾的摩，便翻查電話簿
so I figured he's from Baltimore, and I looked in the phone book.

236
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,780
那裡有一間叫「你自己」的自助式倉庫
And there's a "Your Self' storage facility...

237
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,450
在巴爾的摩市外圍
right outside of downtown Baltimore, sir.

238
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,920
31號倉已經租了十年...
Unit 31 was leased...

239
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,390
租金是全數預繳的
for 10 years, prepaid in full.

240
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,460
合約是以一個...
The contract was in the name...

241
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,430
是赫斯達・莫菲小姐的人定的
of a Miss Hester Mofet.

242
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,260
自從1980年就沒有人來過了？
So nobody's been in here since 1980?

243
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,260
以我所知是沒有
Not to my knowledge.

244
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,600
我的顧客都很重視私隱權的
Privacy is a great concern to my customers.

245
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,500
對，我答應不會擾亂任何東西
Yes, I won't disturb anything, I promise.

246
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,750
我很快便會離開
I'll be out of here before you know it.

247
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,540
-要幫忙嗎？　-好的
- May I help you? - Yes, actually.

248
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,850
這裡
Here.

249
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:36,120
-它被卡著　-明天可以叫我的兒子來
- It's stuck. - We could return tomorrow with my son.

250
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,760
他怎麼樣？
What about him?

251
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:45,070
我本可叫我的司機幫你，但他討厭體力勞動
I would ask my driver to help you, but he detests physical labor.

252
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,860
是吧
Right.

253
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,130
你別走開，我很快回來
You stay here. I'll be back in one minute.

254
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,430
它被卡著，請你把那支電筒給我
It's stuck. Will you hand me that flashlight?

255
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,590
如果這道門跌下來...
If this door should fall down...

256
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,590
或者有什麼意外...
or anything else...

257
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,090
這是我們巴爾的摩辦公室的電話號碼
this is the number for our Baltimore office.

258
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,190
他們知道你跟我在一起的
They know that you're with me.

259
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,130
-如果有意外就找他們吧　-好的，史達琳小姐
- Call them if anything should happen. - Yes, Miss Starling.

260
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,120
克麗絲，他們在等你
Clarice. Here, they're waiting for you.

261
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,630
小心
Watch your step.

262
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,890
「赫斯達・莫菲」是拼字猜謎吧？
Hester Mofet. It's an anagram, isn't it, doctor?

263
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:38,000
意思是「我其餘的東西」
Hester Mofet: "The rest of me"?

264
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:42,340
那表示車庫是你租的？
"Miss The Rest Of Me," meaning that you rented that garage?

265
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,310
謝謝
Thank you.

266
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,810
你止血了
Your bleeding has stopped.

267
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,470
怎麼...？
How did...?

268
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,550
沒有大礙的
It's nothing.

269
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,680
只是皮外傷
It's just a scratch.

270
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,580
萊達醫生，那瓶里的頭顱是誰的？
Dr. Lecter, whose head is in that bottle?

271
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,920
為什麼你不問我，關於水牛比爾的事？
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?

272
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,790
你知道他的事？
Do you know something about him?

273
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,760
如果我看過檔案可能知道的，你可以替我拿
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.

274
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:47,270
談談莫菲小姐吧，你要我去找他
Let's talk about Miss Mofet. You wanted me to find him.

275
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:53,410
他的真名是班哲文・賴普，是我的前病患
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine...

276
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,580
他的戀愛對象，有點怪異
whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic.

277
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,410
我沒有殺他，只是把他藏起來，就像我發現他時的樣子
I did not kill him, merely tucked him away, very much as I found him...

278
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,990
在他錯過了三次約會之後
after he'd missed three appointments.

279
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,320
若你沒有殺他，那麼是誰殺？
If you didn't kill him, who did?

280
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,520
誰知道？對他來說是件好事
Who can say? Best thing for him, really.

281
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,200
他的治療沒有功效
His therapy was going nowhere.

282
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,790
他的裙子，化妝...
His dress, makeup...

283
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,800
賴普是個異性裝扮癖好者？
Raspail was a transvestite?

284
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:25,670
生活上？不是，只是普通的躁狂抑鬱
In life? Oh, no. Garden variety manic-depressive.

285
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,340
乏味，非常乏味
Tedious, very tedious.

286
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,980
現在我把他看成是一個實驗
I now think of him as an experiment.

287
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,680
一個沒經驗的殺手嘗試轉變
A fledgling killer's first effort at transformation.

288
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,650
你看到他時有何感覺？
How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice?

289
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,950
初時很害怕，後來...
Scared at first, then...

290
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,390
便很振奮
exhilarated.

291
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,220
克勞福在提拔你，是嗎？
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he?

292
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:48,120
看來你們互相傾慕呢
Apparently, he likes you and you like him too.

293
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,590
我從沒有想過
I never thought about it.

294
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,830
你認為克勞福對你有遐想嗎？
Do you think Jack Crawford wants you, sexually?

295
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:59,200
他年紀大很多，你對他可有想入非非？
He is much older, but do you think he visualizes scenarios, exchanges?

296
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,570
跟你做愛？
Fucking you?

297
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:08,740
我沒有興趣，這是邁克斯會說的那種話
That doesn't interest me. It's the sort of thing that Miggs would say.

298
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,290
不再是了
Not anymore.

299
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,520
謝謝你，巴尼
Thank you, Barney.

300
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,400
你的畫呢？
What happened to your drawings?

301
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:33,570
懲罰，為了邁克斯那件事，像那個傳道節目...
Punishment, you see, for Miggs. Just like that gospel program.

302
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,510
你離開後他們就會調高聲音
When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up.

303
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:40,070
奇頓醫生喜歡這些折磨伎倆
Dr. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.

304
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:43,110
你說轉變是什麼意思？
What did you mean by "transformation," doctor?

305
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,630
克麗絲，我在這裡八年了
I've been in this room for eight years now, Clarice.

306
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:59,370
我知道在我有生之年，他們都不會釋放我
I know they will never ever let me out while I'm alive.

307
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,330
我想要的是一個景觀
What I want is a view.

308
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:06,300
我想要一個看到樹和水的窗戶
I want a window where I can see a tree or even water.

309
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,170
我想去一間遠離奇頓醫生的聯邦監獄
I want to be in a federal institution far away from Dr. Chilton.

310
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,780
你說「沒經驗的殺手」，是什麼意思？
What did you mean by "fledgling killer"?

311
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,740
你是否說他已經再次殺人？
Are you saying he's killed again?

312
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,310
我根據案件的證據，給你對水牛比爾...
I'm offering you a psychological profile on Buffalo Bill...

313
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,610
作心理分析
based on the case evidence.

314
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,060
我會幫你抓到他
I'll help you catch him, Clarice.

315
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,030
你知道他是誰，是不是？
You know who he is, don't you?

316
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,570
告訴我誰把你的病人斬首了
Tell me who decapitated your patient, doctor.

317
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:43,570
願意等待的人都有好報的
All good things to those who wait.

318
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:48,210
我已經等了，但傑克能等多久？
I've waited, Clarice. But how long can you and old Jackie-boy wait?

319
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:53,950
我們的小比爾一定正在找尋著，下一位特別的女士了
Our little Billy must already be searching for that next special lady.

320
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:01,490
（田納西州孟斐斯市）

321
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,250
小貓咪
Hey, little cheeper.

322
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,200
我快來了
I'll be right there.

323
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:29,850
天啊！
Jeez!

324
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,620
要我幫忙嗎？
Can I help you with that?

325
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,690
可以嗎？
Would you?

326
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,090
當然可以
Sure.

327
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:42,630
謝謝你
Thank you.

328
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:45,160
不用客氣，你好像是傷殘人士
That's all right. You look kind of handicapped.

329
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:49,300
是的，我搬到這裡但搬不上貨車
Yeah. I got it this far, I just can't get it up in the truck by myself.

330
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,400
來吧，抓著，上！
Here, grab this. Up!

331
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,860
好的
Okay.

332
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,440
把它放下吧，很好
Just set it down. That's good.

333
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:59,410
你上車，我想把它推進去
Get in the truck. I want to push it all the way up.

334
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,780
真的很謝謝你
I really appreciate this. Thank you.

335
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,320
放到後面去
Just go all the way back.

336
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,550
行了嗎？
Okay. Is this good?

337
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:10,590
行了，很好
Yeah, that's good.

338
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,790
-真好　-好的
- That's great. - Okay.

339
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:17,170
你大概穿十四號吧？
Say, are you about a size 14?

340
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:18,560
什麼？
Sorry?

341
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,580
（十四號）

342
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,120
好
Good.

343
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:03,440
好極了...
Oh, good. Good.

344
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,360
抓著
Holds!

345
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,430
一！
Ones!

346
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,200
史達琳！
Starling!

347
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,050
出去，我們走吧
Outside. Let's go.

348
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:42,810
仙蒂，進場代替史達琳，來吧
Cindy, in the ring for Starling. Let's go!

349
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,960
收拾你的裝備
Pack your field gear.

350
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,820
-我們會跟克勞福一起去　-去哪裡？
- You're going with Crawford. - Where?

351
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,690
在西維吉尼亞，發現了一名女子屍體
Found a girl's body in West Virginia.

352
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,600
她在水里一周了，看來是水牛比爾做的
Been in the water a week. Looks like Buffalo Bill.

353
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,940
（西維吉尼亞州克萊縣）

354
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,810
（聯邦調查局）

355
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,790
讓她們活上三天，我們不明白原因
Keeps them alive for three days. We don't know why.

356
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:19,080
死前沒有強姦或虐待的跡象
No evidence of rape or physical abuse prior to death.

357
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,760
這些傷口都是死後造成的
All the mutilation you see there is postmortem.

358
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,420
三天...
Okay, three days...

359
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,960
然後他開槍射死她們，剝皮和棄屍
then he shoots them, skins them and dumps them

360
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,790
每個屍體棄置在不同的河上
Each body in a different river.

361
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:33,190
河水衝走了證據
The water leaves us no trace evidence of any kind.

362
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,800
那是第一個，費迪嘉・拜姆
That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one.

363
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,840
她的屍體是唯一被他沈下去的
Her body was the only one he weighted down.

364
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,870
實際上，她是第三個被發現的
So actually, she was the third girl found.

365
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,370
繼她之後，他變得懶惰了
After her, he got lazy.

366
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,880
好的，我們看看
Okay, let's see.

367
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:53,350
圓圈是那些女子被擄走的位置，箭嘴是屍體被發現的地點
Circles where the girls were abducted. Arrows where their bodies were found.

368
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:58,650
今天這個被衝到這裡來，在西維吉尼亞州埃爾克河被發現
This new one today washed up here. Elk River, West Virginia.

369
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,980
史達琳，仔細看看，告訴我你有什麼發現
Look at him, Starling. Tell me what you see.

370
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,680
他是個白種男人
Well, he's a white male.

371
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,790
連環殺手傾向於在自己的族群中獵殺
Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic groups.

372
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,990
他不是個流浪者，他有自己的獨立房子
He's not a drifter. He's got his own house, not an apartment.

373
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,860
-為什麼？　-他下毒手時，需要私人地方
- Why? - What he does with them takes privacy.

374
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:40,500
他年約三四十歲，孔武有力
He's in his 30s or 40s. He's got real physical strength.

375
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,040
還有中年人的自制能力，謹慎而準繩
Combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise.

376
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,310
他從來不衝動，也不會罷休
And he's never impulsive. He'll never stop.

377
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,170
為什麼
Why not?

378
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:56,140
他已經迷上了這回事，而且越來越熟練
He's got a real taste for it now, and he's getting better at his work.

379
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:00,650
不錯呢，有問題嗎？
Not bad, Starling. Questions?

380
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,690
有的
Yes, sir.

381
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:06,620
你沒有提及我報告里的任何資料
You haven't mentioned anything about the information in my report...

382
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,260
或者萊達醫生的提議
or Dr. Lecter's offer, sir.

383
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,260
我正在考慮中
I'm considering it.

384
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,360
所以你派我去病院
That's why you sent me in there, isn't it?

385
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,730
找他協助緝捕水牛比爾？
To get his help on Buffalo Bill, sir?

386
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,430
如果那是事實...
Well, if that was the case, then I just...

387
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,410
我希望可以早點知道罷了
I just wish I was in on it, that's all.

388
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,780
若以真正目的派你去，萊達會識破的
If I'd sent you in there with a real agenda, Lecter would have known it.

389
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:32,540
他會把你玩弄，什麼也不會說
He would have toyed with you, then turned to stone.

390
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,700
（格里殯儀館）

391
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,880
打擾了，柏金斯警長？
Excuse me, Sheriff Perkins?

392
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,390
這些是聯邦調查局人員
These are the FBI people.

393
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:14,690
柏金斯警長，我是傑克・克勞福，這是泰瑞和史達琳
Sheriff Perkins, Jack Crawford, FBI. Special Agent Terry, Agent Starling.

394
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:17,490
感謝邀請我們來到你們的管轄區
We appreciate being invited to your jurisdiction.

395
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:21,000
是州政府檢察部找你們的
Somebody from the state attorney's office called you.

396
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,300
我們會通力合作，但現在...
We'll extend you every courtesy, but right now...

397
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,730
警長
Sheriff...

398
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:30,170
我認為該在私底下談論這類性罪行的細節
this type of sex crime has aspects I'd just as soon discuss in private.

399
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,980
你明白吧？
Know what I mean?

400
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,320
奧加，去教堂叫區醫生來
Oscar, fetch Dr. Akin from the chapel.

401
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,950
我們在後面這裡
We're back here.

402
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:29,960
叫拉瑪彈奏完畢後過來
Tell Lamar to come on when he's finished playing his music.

403
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,600
是的，我們稍後會傳過來
Yeah, we'll be sending in a minute.

404
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,630
行了
It's working.

405
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:39,200
我要組成六線聯繫，芝加哥，底特律...
I need a six-way link up. Chicago, Detroit...

406
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,810
什麼？
What? What?

407
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,440
對不起
Excuse me.

408
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,950
對不起，各位警官先生，聽著
Excuse me, officers and gentlemen. Listen here, now.

409
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,350
我們要替她做一些事情
There's things we need to do for her.

410
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,060
你們把她帶來了這裡，她的家人會感謝...
Y'all brought her this far, and her folks would thank you if they could...

411
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,860
你們的善意和體諒
for your kindness and your sensitivity.

412
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,790
請離開吧，讓我們照顧她好了
Please, go on now, and let us take care of her.

413
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,120
走吧
Go on, now.

414
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,300
謝謝
Thank you.

415
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:14,800
謝謝
Thank you.

416
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:17,840
很好
Okay, good.

417
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:30,820
是的，埃爾克河，準備傳送
Yeah, that's right. Elk River. Stand by for transmission.

418
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:35,890
瑞
Ray.

419
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,170
大家來看看她吧
Doctor, Lamar. Let's take a look at her.

420
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,490
天啊
Jesus...

421
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:17,960
史達琳，行了
Okay, Starling.

422
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:45,360
胸骨上有星形的傷口
Star-shaped contact entrance wound over the sternum.

423
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:49,170
上面有個槍口印記
A muzzle stamp at the top.

424
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,040
-死於非命　-死於非命
- Wrongful death. - Wrongful death.

425
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:55,970
她要被送去克拉斯頓的病理學家那裡
She'll have to go to the state pathologist's at Claxton.

426
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,400
我還是回去那個喪禮了
Well, I better get back to that service.

427
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,910
利瑪會幫你們的
Lamar will help you.

428
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,810
老天爺
Lord Almighty.

429
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:08,820
你還觀察到什麼？
What else do you see, Starling?

430
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,390
她不是當地人
Well, she's not local.

431
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,360
她穿了三個耳洞，還有...
Her ears are pierced three times and there's...

432
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,800
閃亮的指甲油，看來是城市人
glitter nail polish. It looks like town to me.

433
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,940
她有兩只指甲斷了
Two of her fingernails are broken off...

434
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:32,440
指甲下有泥土和沙粒
and there's dirt or grit under them.

435
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,710
她好像想爬過一些什麼似的
It looks like she's tried to claw her way through something.

436
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:38,880
瑞，替她的牙齒拍照，稍後傳真到失蹤人口組
Ray, get pictures of her teeth. We'll fax them to Missing Persons.

437
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,380
好的
Right.

438
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,330
再拍一張
Let's do another.

439
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,100
她喉嚨里有東西
She's got something in her throat.

440
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,610
當屍體被撈出水面時
When a body comes out of the water...

441
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,410
口裡總會有些樹葉之類的東西
lots of times there's leaves and things in the mouth.

442
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,110
那是什麼？
What is that?

443
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,870
豆莢嗎？
Some kind of seedpod?

444
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:45,920
不，是一隻蟲繭
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.

445
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:49,160
沒可能自己走進去的
There's no way that could get way down in there.

446
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:52,050
除非有人把它塞進去
Not unless somebody shoved it in there.

447
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,720
我們把她翻過來會較易採指紋
She'll be easier to print when we turn her.

448
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,230
幫幫我
Lamar, give me a hand?

449
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,930
好的
Yes, sir, I will.

450
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:08,040
你看這些是什麼？
Oh, Jack. What do you make of these?

451
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:11,470
跟其他死者的形狀不同，拍幾張大特寫
Different configuration than the other victims. Get close-ups.

452
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,240
死者的皮膚...
Victim's skin removed...

453
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:16,580
在臀部以上，有兩塊菱形的皮膚被剝去
in two diamond-shaped sections above the buttocks.

454
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:19,980
傷口跟第二或第三節脊骨平衡
Exit wound level with the second or third thoracic vertebrae...

455
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,990
距離右肩胛骨大約六英吋
approximately six inches from the right shoulder blade.

456
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:24,620
史達琳
Starling...

457
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:29,260
我對那個警長說，我們不該在女人面前談
when I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman...

458
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:31,060
那令你很氣惱吧？
that burned you, didn't it?

459
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:34,730
那只是個煙幕，我要打發他走
It was just smoke, Starling. I had to get rid of him

460
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,700
是很要緊
It matters, Mr. Crawford.

461
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,100
探員們想看你怎樣應付
Cops look at you to see how to act.

462
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,740
很要緊的
It matters.

463
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,310
我明白了
Point taken.

464
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:50,510
手腕周圍有被捆綁的痕跡
Ligature marks found around wrists...

465
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:52,310
足踝就沒有
not around the ankles.

466
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,350
顯示死後才剝皮的
This would indicate that the skinning was postmortem.

467
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,340
時間到了，輪到我
Time, Pilch. My move.

468
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:25,380
-不公平，你用食物引誘它　-真無賴，仍然是輪到我
- No fair! You lured him with produce. - Tough noogies. It's still my turn.

469
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,790
寶貝，慢慢來
Nice and slow, baby.

470
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,560
若那只甲蟲推動你的棋子，也算數嗎？
If the beetle moves one of your men, does that still count?

471
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:35,360
當然算數，你怎麼玩的？
Of course it counts. How do you play?

472
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,160
史達琳探員？
Agent Starling?

473
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,260
這東西從哪裡來的？
Where the heck did this come from?

474
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:43,260
它粘糊糊的
It's practically mush.

475
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:47,740
在一個被殺死者身上找到的，屍體在埃爾克河裡
It was found in a murder victim. The body was in the Elk River.

476
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:49,380
是水牛比爾乾的嗎？
It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?

477
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,910
我不能透露
I can't tell you any more.

478
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,340
我們在電台聽到
We heard it on the radio.

479
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,850
這是一宗真實謀殺案的線索？酷
You mean this is a clue from a real murder case? Cool!

480
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,640
別管他，他是無名小卒
Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.

481
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,750
小角天蛾，可能是...
Sphingid Ceratomia, maybe...

482
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:04,620
它是只大吸血鬼
Boy, he's a big sucker.

483
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:06,760
好吧
Okay...

484
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:08,860
查看一下形態學
let's check morphology.

485
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:20,430
史達琳探員，你不查案時會做什麼？
What do you do when you're not detecting, Agent Starling?

486
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,350
做個學生
Try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.

487
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:27,420
你去過吃起司漢堡和喝啤酒嗎？
You ever go out for cheeseburgers and beer?

488
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:30,450
那有趣的招牌酒？
The amusing house wine?

489
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:32,480
博士，你是否對我有意？
Are you hitting on me, doctor?

490
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,190
-是的　-找到了！
- Yes. - Gotcha!

491
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:36,250
你找到什麼？
What do you got?

492
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:41,330
史達琳探員，這個是陰間冥河
Agent Starling, meet Mr. Acherontia Styx.

493
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:42,690
真奇怪
Weird.

494
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:46,090
認識它的人多叫它做骷髏飛蛾
Better known to his friends as the Death's-head moth.

495
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:47,460
它從哪裡來的？
Where does it come from?

496
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,570
這正是古怪之處，它們只活在亞洲
That's what's strange. They only live in Asia.

497
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:53,430
它們是從進口的卵子繁殖的
They're specially raised from imported eggs.

498
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:57,010
有人飼養這只東西，餵它吃蜜糖和茄類植物
Somebody grew this guy. Fed him honey and nightshade.

499
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,970
給它保暖
Kept him warm.

500
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,540
有人很愛護它
Somebody loved him.

501
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:37,480
你在哪裡？
Where are you?!

502
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,020
放我出去！
Let me out of here!

503
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,320
餵！
Hey!

504
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:51,930
救我！
Please help me!

505
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,830
求你救我
Help me, please!

506
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:59,570
乾嘛你不答我？求求你！
Why won't you answer me?! Please!

507
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:05,810
-各位早，我是唐娜・佛魯茲　-我是報導體育的金・凱素
- Good morning. I'm Donna Ferucchi. - I'm Gene Cassel with sports.

508
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,920
我是提姆・蘭漢，今早的頭條新聞如下
And I'm Tim Langhorn. Our top story this morning:

509
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:13,620
馬丁參議員的25歲女兒凱瑟琳・馬丁...
Catherine Martin, the 25-year-old daughter of Senator Ruth Martin...

510
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:15,120
一度被列為失蹤人士
listed as a missing person...

511
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:19,830
相信她已經被稱為「水牛比爾」的殺手綁架
is believed to have been kidnapped by the killer known as "Buffalo Bill."

512
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:23,460
孟斐斯市警方說，已確認出該名失蹤女孩的襯衫
Memphis police say the missing girl's blouse has been identified...

513
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:28,100
它後面被割破，案情耐人尋味
sliced up the back, in what has become a kind of grim calling card.

514
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,870
凱瑟琳是田納西州的共和黨...
Young Catherine is the only daughter of U.S. Senator Ruth Martin...

515
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,640
馬丁參議員的獨生女
the Republican senator from Tennessee.

516
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:38,440
雖然這宗綁架案沒有政治動機
And while her kidnapping is not considered politically motivated...

517
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:41,550
但政府高層仍然相當重視
it has stirred the government to its highest levels.

518
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,550
正在佛蒙特州滑雪的總統
Reached for comment on the ski slopes of Vermont...

519
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:48,350
接受訪問時表示，「極度關注」事件
the president himself said to be, and I quote, "intensely concerned."

520
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:53,150
馬丁參議員於較早前，錄影了以下的呼籲
Just moments ago, Senator Martin taped this dramatic personal plea:

521
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:57,130
我向挾持小女的人說話
I'm speaking, now, to the person holding my daughter.

522
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:01,700
凱瑟琳是非常溫文和善良的
Catherine is very gentle and kind.

523
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,470
你跟她談談就知道
Talk to her and you'll see.

524
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:09,640
你有力量，你有控制權
You have the power. You are in charge.

525
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:15,750
我知道你感受到愛和善心的
I know you can feel love and compassion.

526
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:20,780
你有一個向全世界展示的大好機會...
You have a wonderful chance to show the whole world...

527
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,490
就是你是善良而堅強的
that you can be merciful, as well as strong.

528
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,420
你有能力善待凱瑟琳...
That you're big enough to treat Catherine better...

529
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,860
比這個世界待你更好
than the world has treated you.

530
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,560
你有此能力
You have that power.

531
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:36,340
求你，我的女兒是凱瑟琳
Please. My daughter is Catherine.

532
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,630
真是聰明
Boy, that's smart.

533
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:40,270
真的很聰明
Jesus, that's really smart.

534
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:42,440
她不斷重復那個名字
She keeps repeating the name.

535
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:47,240
若他視凱瑟琳為一個人而非物件，就難以下毒手
If he sees Catherine as a person, not an object, it's harder to tear her up.

536
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:51,150
求你放了我的女兒
Please, release my little girl.

537
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:55,010
史達琳小姐，你來我的醫院幹什麼？
What you're doing, Ms. Starling, is coming into my hospital...

538
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,780
並第三次拒絕跟我分享資料
and refusing to share information with me for the third time.

539
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,600
這不過是賴普案的例行後續
Sir, I told you this is just a routine follow-up on the Raspail...

540
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,930
他是我的病人，我有知情權
He is my patient. I have rights.

541
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:06,900
我明白
I understand that.

542
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:11,640
史達琳小姐，我不是個笨蛋
Look, I am not just some turnkey, Miss Starling.

543
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:15,000
這是檢察官的電話號碼
This is the number for the U.S. Attorney.

544
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,510
請你跟他談，或者讓我執行任務，明白嗎？
Please, either discuss it with him or let me do my job, you understand?

545
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,220
如果你的分析能幫助我們抓到水牛比爾...
If your profile helps us catch Buffalo Bill...

546
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:31,020
及時救出凱瑟琳・馬丁...
in time to save Catherine Martin...

547
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:34,730
參議員答應把你轉送到...
the senator promises you a transfer to the VA Hospital...

548
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:38,360
它位於紐約奧尼達公園，可看到附近的園林景色的醫院
at Oneida Park, New York, with a view of the woods nearby.

549
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:41,260
當然仍是高度設防的
Maximum security still applies, of course.

550
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,270
你可以閱讀書籍
You'd have reasonable access to books.

551
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,270
最好的是...
Best of all, though...

552
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:51,500
你每年可以離開醫院一周
one week of the year, you get to leave the hospital...

553
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,050
去這裡
and go here:

554
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:58,480
普拉姆島
Plum Island.

555
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,680
在那一星期里，你都可以在沙灘漫步
Every day of that week, you may walk on the beach

556
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,090
也可以在海中暢泳一小時
You may swim in the ocean for up to one hour...

557
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,890
當然是受特種部隊的監視
under SWAT team surveillance, of course.

558
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:11,260
給你的
And there you have it.

559
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:18,270
水牛比爾的檔案副本
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.

560
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,640
參議員的建議書副本
A copy of the senator's offer.

561
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:25,140
這個建議是無商討餘地的
This offer is non-negotiable and final.

562
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,380
凱瑟琳・馬丁死了你就一無所得
Catherine Martin dies, you get nothing.

563
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:43,320
普拉姆島動物病症研究中心
Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center.

564
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:46,600
聽來很吸引
Sounds charming.

565
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:51,000
那個島有一流的海灘
That's only part of the island. There's a very nice beach.

566
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:53,470
島上有燕鷗巢，有漂亮的...
Terns nest there. There's beautiful...

567
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,800
燕鷗？
Terns?

568
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:59,840
如果我幫你，也會是我們的轉機
If I help you, Clarice, it will be "turns" with us too.

569
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,140
我們互相交換資料吧
Quid pro quo. I tell you things, you tell me things.

570
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,980
但不是關於這宗案件，是關於你自己
Not about this case, though. About yourself.

571
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:09,120
交換，好不好？
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?

572
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,130
好嗎？克麗絲，可憐的凱瑟琳在等著
Yes or no, Clarice? Poor little Catherine is waiting.

573
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,800
好吧
Go, doctor.

574
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,590
你最糟的童年記憶是什麼？
What is your worst memory of childhood?

575
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:25,230
家父去世
The death of my father.

576
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:29,200
告訴我，別說謊，我會知道的
Tell me about it. And don't lie, or I'll know.

577
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,410
他是鎮上的警長
He was a town marshal...

578
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:38,980
有一晚他遇上兩個，從藥房走出來的竊匪
and one night he surprised two burglars coming out of a drugstore.

579
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,150
他們向他開槍
They shot him.

580
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:45,050
他當場死亡？
Was he killed outright?

581
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:49,820
不是，他很堅強，熬了個幾個月
No, he was very strong. He lasted more than a month.

582
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,970
我母親在我年幼時去世
My mother died when I was very young, so...

583
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:58,160
自始父親就成為我的一切
my father had become the whole world to me...

584
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,710
他離開後，我一無所有，我那時十歲
and when he left me, I had nothing. I was 10 years old.

585
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:05,110
你很坦白
You're very frank, Clarice.

586
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:10,140
我相信私底下結識你，會很有意思的
I think it would be quite something to know you in private life.

587
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:13,920
交換資料
Quid pro quo, doctor.

588
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:19,560
談談西維州小姐吧，她是否身材肥大？
So tell me about Miss West Virginia. Was she a large girl?

589
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:23,130
是的
Yes.

590
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:25,760
大屁股，肉團團？
Big through the hips, roomy?

591
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:27,300
死者們全都是
They all were.

592
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,200
還有什麼線索？
What else?

593
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:33,140
她的喉嚨被異物塞住
She had an object deliberately inserted into her throat.

594
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:37,910
還沒有正式公佈的，我們不知道它有何意思
Now, that hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what it means.

595
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,740
一隻蝴蝶？
Was it a butterfly?

596
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,780
是的，一隻飛蛾
Yes. A moth.

597
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:49,080
一小時前，我們在班哲文・賴普的頭顱內也找到
Just like the one we found in Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.

598
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:51,890
為何他把它們放進去？
Why does he place them there, doctor?

599
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:56,590
飛蛾的特點是轉變
The significance of the moth is change.

600
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,940
幼蟲變成蝶蛹或者蛹
Caterpillar into chrysalis, or pupa...

601
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:03,360
再變成美麗的蝴蝶
and from thence into beauty.

602
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:06,670
比爾也想轉變
Our Billy wants to change too.

603
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:10,640
變性癖和暴力之間是沒有關連的
There's no correlation between transsexualism and violence.

604
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:13,580
-變性癖者是很被動的　-很聰明
- Transsexuals are very passive. - Clever girl.

605
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:17,580
你有捉拿到他的本領，知道嗎？
You're so close to the way you're gonna catch him. Do you realize that?

606
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:19,680
不知道，為什麼？
No. Tell me why.

607
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:24,250
你父親被殺後你成了孤兒，後來怎麼樣？
After your father's murder you were orphaned. What happened next?

608
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:32,390
答案並非在那雙廉價鞋子上
I don't imagine the answer is on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.

609
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:36,430
我去了蒙大拿州，跟我母親的表妹夫婦同住
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana.

610
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:38,000
他們有一個牧場
They had a ranch.

611
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:39,970
牧牛場？
Was it a cattle ranch?

612
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,030
牧羊和馬
Sheep and horses.

613
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,910
你在那裡住了多久？
How long did you live there?

614
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:45,980
兩個月
Two months.

615
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:47,670
為何時間這麼短？
Why so briefly?

616
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:49,340
我跑掉了
I ran away.

617
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,650
為什麼？牧場主人逼你口交？
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher make you perform fellatio?

618
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:55,820
他有沒有雞姦你？
Did he sodomize you?

619
00:56:56,590 --> 00:57:00,080
沒有，他是個很正派的人
No. He was a very decent man.

620
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,020
交換資料
Quid pro quo, doctor.

621
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:07,700
比爾不是個真正的變性癖者
Billy is not a real transsexual.

622
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,770
但他以為自己是，他想那樣
But he thinks he is. He tries to be.

623
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:12,840
我相信他想做很多東西
He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.

624
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:17,210
你說我有捉拿他的本領，是何意思？
You said I was very close to the way we'd catch him. What did you mean?

625
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,940
有三間主要做變性手術的中心
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery:

626
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:24,310
約翰・霍金斯，明尼蘇達州大學，和哥倫布醫療中心
Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical Center.

627
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:27,820
若比爾向它們申請做變性手術，而又被拒絕...
I wouldn't be surprised if Billy applied for sex reassignment...

628
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:31,720
我也不會感到驚訝
at one or all of them, and been rejected.

629
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:33,690
他們根據什麼來拒絕他？
On what basis would they reject him?

630
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:39,270
試找尋跟暴力有關的童年創傷吧
Look for severe childhood disturbances associated with violence.

631
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:42,330
比爾並非天生是個罪犯
Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice...

632
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:46,540
是經過多年來慣常的，虐待所導致的
he was made one through years of systematic abuse.

633
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,210
他討厭自己的身份
Billy hates his own identity, you see...

634
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:53,140
他以為那是令他成為變性癖者的原因
and he thinks that makes him a transsexual...

635
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:57,540
但他的病徵要更凶殘...
but his pathology is a thousand times more savage...

636
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:59,480
和可怕千倍
and more terrifying.

637
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:06,890
它塗潤膚液在身上，它聽到指示總會依著做
It rubs the lotion on its skin. It does this whenever it's told.

638
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,090
先生，我的家人會付錢的
Mister, my family will pay cash.

639
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:12,490
無論你要多少贖金，他們都會付
Whatever ransom you're asking for, they'll pay it.

640
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:18,140
它塗潤膚液在身上，否則又要挨打了
It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.

641
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,240
是的，珍寶，她會挨打的
Yes, she will, Precious. She'll get the hose.

642
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:26,040
好吧...
Okay, okay, okay.

643
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:28,910
我做吧
Okay, I'll do it.

644
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:30,620
好的
Okay.

645
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:37,120
先生，如果你放我走，我答應不會起訴你
Mister, if you let me go, I won't press charges. I promise.

646
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:40,630
我媽是個重要人物
See, my mom is a real important woman.

647
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:42,760
相信你也知道吧
I guess you already know that.

648
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:45,970
它把潤膚液放在籃里
Now it places the lotion in the basket.

649
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:47,540
求求你！
Please!

650
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,500
求求你，我想回家
Please, I want to go home.

651
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:54,400
我想回家！求求你！放我吧
I want to go home! Please! Please let me.

652
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,010
把潤膚液放在籃里
It places the lotion in the basket.

653
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:02,040
我想見我媽媽，求你放我吧
I want to see my mommy. Please let me.

654
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:06,480
我想再見到我媽媽，我想...
I want to see my mom again. I want...

655
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:09,220
我想見我媽媽
I want to see my mom.

656
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,460
把那他媽的潤膚液放在籃里！
Put the fucking lotion in the basket!

657
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:52,300
你仍然以為可在沙灘漫步，和看鳥兒嗎？
You still think you're gonna walk on some beach and see the birdies?

658
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:54,300
不會了
I don't think so.

659
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,630
我找過凱瑟琳・馬丁參議員
I called Senator Ruth Martin.

660
00:59:57,910 --> 01:00:00,530
她沒聽過跟你有任何協議
She never heard of any deal with you.

661
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,970
他們騙你
They scammed you, Hannibal.

662
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:06,980
出去
Stand outside.

663
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:09,940
把門關上
And shut the door.

664
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:11,550
巴尼
Barney.

665
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,960
從沒有跟馬丁參議員作過協議，但現在有了
There never was a deal with Senator Martin, but there is now.

666
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:23,390
是我議定的
I designed it.

667
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:27,290
當然，我也為自己的利益，定下了一些條件
Of course, I worked in a few conditions for my own benefit as well.

668
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,630
說出水牛比爾的名字
Identify Buffalo Bill by name...

669
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:32,900
如果那個女孩及時被發現
and if the girl is found in time...

670
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:37,370
你就會被轉送到田納西州的叢樹山州立監獄
you'll be transferred to Brushy Mountain State Prison in Tennessee.

671
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:40,280
回答我
Answer me, Hannibal.

672
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:43,450
你現在回答我
You answer me now...

673
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:46,680
否則，天啊，你休想離開這個牢房
or, by God, you'll never leave this cell.

674
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,190
水牛比爾是誰？
Who is Buffalo Bill?

675
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:54,220
他的名字是路易斯
His first name is Louis.

676
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:58,190
其餘的我只會在田納西州，親自對參議員說
I'll tell the rest to the Senator herself, but only in Tennessee.

677
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,870
我也有幾個條件
And I have a few conditions of my own.

678
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:05,600
替他梳洗一下，準備出發
Clean him up and get him ready to go.

679
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:09,840
傑克，漢尼拔・萊達正被轉送往孟斐斯途中
Jack, Hannibal Lecter is being transferred to Memphis.

680
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:10,780
轉送？
Transferred?

681
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:15,820
你可有個見習生，冒參議員之名，向萊達提出一個虛假的建議？
Did you have a trainee make a phony offer to Lecter in the senator's name?

682
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:17,980
是我的主意，我逼不得已
I rolled the dice. I had to.

683
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,290
她氣瘋了
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.

684
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,350
司法部的保羅・肯度拿來了
Paul Krendler's here from Justice.

685
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:25,390
她要求他在孟斐斯接手
She's asking him to take over in Memphis.

686
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:35,760
（孟斐斯市國際機場）

687
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:51,880
萊達醫生，歡迎到孟斐斯
Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter.

688
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:54,710
我是鮑爾探員，這位是派屈克警長
I'm Lieutenant Boyle. This is Sergeant Patrick.

689
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:57,080
我們會像你待我們那麼好的
We'll treat you as good as you treat us.

690
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:00,390
你乖乖的，就會得到舒服的待遇
You be a gentleman, you'll get three hots and a cot.

691
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:05,230
長官，請在這裡簽名，我們作合法的移交
Sir, if you sign right here, we'll have us a legal transfer.

692
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:12,260
用我的吧
Here, sir, use mine.

693
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:00,450
馬丁參議員
Senator Martin...

694
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:04,020
漢尼拔・萊達醫生
Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

695
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:10,320
萊達醫生
Dr. Lecter...

696
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:14,270
我帶了一份宣誓書，保證你新的權利
l've brought an affidavit guaranteeing your new rights.

697
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,040
在我簽署前你要看看的
You'll want to read it before I sign.

698
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:24,940
我不會為了小利益，而耽誤你或凱瑟琳的時間
I won't waste your time or Catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges.

699
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:28,980
克麗絲・史達琳和克勞福，已經浪費了太多時間
Clarice Starling and Jack Crawford have wasted too much time already.

700
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,590
但願他們沒有害死，那個可憐的女孩
I only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl.

701
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,920
讓我幫你吧，事成後我會信任你
Let me help you now. I will trust you when it is all over.

702
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:39,430
我答應你，保羅
You have my word. Paul.

703
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:44,600
水牛比爾的真名是路易斯・法蘭
Buffalo Bill's real name is Louis Friend.

704
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:49,830
我只見過他一次，1980年4 5月間由我的病人...
I met him just once. He was referred to me in April or May, 1980...

705
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:52,730
班哲文・賴普轉介給我的
by my patient Benjamin Raspail.

706
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,870
他們是愛人
They were lovers, you see.

707
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:59,180
但賴普變得很害怕
But Raspail had become very frightened.

708
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:02,880
看來路易斯謀殺了一個流浪漢
Apparently, Louis had murdered a transient...

709
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,410
用他的皮膚做了一些東西
and done things with the skin.

710
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:09,860
我們要他的地址和容貌特徵
We need his address and a physical description.

711
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:12,990
告訴我，參議員...
Tell me, senator.

712
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:15,930
你有沒有親自哺育凱瑟琳？
Did you nurse Catherine yourself?

713
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,990
-什麼？　-你有沒有給她餵奶？
- What? - Did you breast-feed her?

714
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:21,600
-混帳　-我有的
- Now, wait a minute! - Yes. I did.

715
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
令你的乳頭變得堅挺，是嗎？
Toughened your nipples, didn't it?

716
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:25,140
你這個混蛋！
You son of a bitch!

717
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:29,440
把人的腿切除，他仍感到振奮
Amputate a man's leg, and he can still feel it tickling.

718
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:33,040
告訴我，媽媽，當你的小女兒被殺時
Tell me, Mom, when your little girl is on the slab...

719
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:34,680
你哪裡會感到振奮？
where will it tickle you?

720
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:38,980
把這個畜生帶回巴爾的摩
Take this thing back to Baltimore.

721
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:42,890
五英尺十英吋，身材魁悟，約一百八十磅
Five-foot-ten, strongly built, about 180 pounds.

722
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:45,730
金髮，淺藍色眼睛
Hair, blond. Eyes, pale blue.

723
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:47,150
他現在大約三十五歲
He'd be about 35 now.

724
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:50,190
他聲稱住在費城，可能是說謊
He said he lived in Philadelphia but may have lied.

725
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:52,120
我只記得這麼多了，媽
That's all I can remember, Mom.

726
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,030
若我再想起什麼，我會通知你的
But if I think of any more, I will let you know.

727
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,940
參議員，還有一件事
Oh, and senator, just one more thing:

728
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,070
你的套裝很漂亮
Love your suit.

729
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:09,180
與馬丁參議員，在今天較早前的會面中
In a meeting earlier today with Senator Ruth Martin...

730
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:13,680
萊達醫生同意協助追緝水牛比爾
Dr. Lecter agreed to help in the investigation to find Buffalo Bill.

731
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:15,250
（謝爾比縣法院大樓）

732
01:05:16,190 --> 01:05:17,990
-你扮演什麼角色？　-我對萊達醫生的...
- How do you fit in? - My unique insight...

733
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,120
獨特觸覺促成了這次突破
into Lecter made the breakthrough.

734
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,480
水牛比爾叫什麼名字？
Buffalo Bill's name?

735
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,390
這是目前有關當局的秘密
His name is now a matter of record with the proper authorities.

736
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:28,100
-可否給我們...　-我是奇頓醫生
- Can you give us...? - I'm Dr. Frederick Chilton.

737
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:29,900
-怎樣寫法？　-奇特的奇...
- Spell it? - That's C-H...

738
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:33,500
你是奇頓醫生的組員嗎？
Are you with Dr. Chilton's group?

739
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,240
我剛在外面見到他
Well, I just saw him outside, sir.

740
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:39,740
不能有太多人接近萊達，我們接到死亡恐嚇
Access to Lecter is limited. We've received death threats.

741
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:41,520
我明白的
I understand, sir.

742
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,250
登記和把武器放下
Log in and check your weapon.

743
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:52,950
我不能獨自邀功的
I can't take all the credit myself.

744
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:55,460
馬丁參議員，司法部，聯邦調查局
Senator Martin, Justice Department, FBI...

745
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:59,060
巴爾的摩州立醫院的人員，最困難就是...
folks at the Baltimore State Hospital. Now for the hard part:

746
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,030
逮捕那個疑匪
Apprehending the suspect.

747
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,670
對不起，我要趕飛機了
Excuse me, I have to catch a flight.

748
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:10,100
指揮台，我是傑各警員
Command desk, Officer Jacobs.

749
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,450
（路易斯・法蘭飛禽，猥褻）

750
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:18,840
（鐵）

751
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:22,150
-他們說的是事實嗎？　-什麼？
- Is it true what they're saying? - Huh?

752
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:25,190
他是個吸血殭屍？
He's some kind of vampire?

753
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:29,620
他們沒有替他取名
They don't have a name for what he is.

754
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:32,390
小姐，你知道規矩的吧？
You do know the rules, ma'am?

755
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:35,500
知道，我以前盤問過他
Yes, I've questioned him before.

756
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:39,940
去吧
Go ahead.

757
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:19,410
克麗絲，晚安
Good evening, Clarice.

758
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:23,710
你可能想要回你的畫吧
I thought you might like your drawings back.

759
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,350
直到你有自己的景觀
Just until you get your view.

760
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:31,380
真是周到
How very thoughtful.

761
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:35,060
還是在你們破案前，克勞福派你來...
Or did Jack Crawford send you for one last wheedle...

762
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:37,560
說最後一次的花言巧語？
before you're both booted off the case?

763
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:40,260
不，是我自己想來的
No. I came because I wanted to.

764
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:47,370
人家會說我們在戀愛呢
People will say we're in love.

765
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:54,010
安克斯島
Anthrax Island.

766
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:57,150
真是有心思，克麗絲
That was an especially nice touch, Clarice.

767
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,350
你畫的？
Yours?

768
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:00,190
是
Yes.

769
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:01,920
對
Yeah.

770
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:04,280
很好
That was good.

771
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:06,420
但我同情可憐的凱瑟琳
Pity about poor Catherine, though.

772
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,760
滴答...
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

773
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:11,660
你的字謎有破綻了
Your anagrams are showing, doctor.

774
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:14,070
路易斯・法蘭？
Louis Friend?

775
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:18,000
是硫化鐵，也叫做黃銅鐵
Iron sulfide, also known as fool's gold.

776
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:22,270
克麗絲，你的毛病是，你要活得輕鬆一點
Oh, Clarice, your problem is, you need to get more fun out of life.

777
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:25,710
你在巴爾的摩時說了真話
You were telling me the truth back in Baltimore, sir.

778
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,410
現在繼續吧
Please continue now.

779
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:30,520
我看過那些檔案了，你看過嗎？
Well, I've read the case files. Have you?

780
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:33,990
你要緝拿他的資料都在裡面
Everything you need to find him is there in those pages.

781
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:37,020
-那麼教我怎樣做　-首要的原則
- Then tell me how. - First principles, Clarice.

782
01:08:37,390 --> 01:08:40,380
是簡易，讀馬可・奧勒利烏斯吧
Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius.

783
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:44,030
凡事都問：它是什麼？
Of each particular thing, ask: What is it in itself?

784
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:45,990
它有什麼本質？
What is its nature?

785
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:50,330
你尋找的這個人，他做什麼？
What does he do, this man you seek?

786
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:53,130
殺害女人
He kills women.

787
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:56,270
不，那是次要的
No. That is incidental.

788
01:08:56,910 --> 01:09:02,440
他主要是做什麼？他殺人是為了滿足什麼？
What is the principle thing he does? What needs does he serve by killing?

789
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:04,210
憤怒
Anger...

790
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:09,910
社會認同和性困惑
social acceptance and sexual frustration...

791
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:11,020
不是！
No!

792
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,730
他貪圖
He covets.

793
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,130
那是他的本性
That is his nature.

794
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:18,960
我們怎樣才會開始貪圖？
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?

795
01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:22,330
我們是否去尋找貪圖的東西？
Do we seek out things to covet?

796
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:24,800
嘗試回答吧
Make an effort to answer now.

797
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:27,510
不是，我們只是...
No, we just...

798
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:31,070
我們看見日常的東西就開始貪圖
No, we begin by coveting what we see every day.

799
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:34,580
你可有感到一些眼睛在盯著你？
Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice?

800
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:38,680
你的眼睛，又可有尋找你要的東西？
And don't your eyes seek out the things you want?

801
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,750
有的，請你告訴我吧
All right, yes. Now, please tell me how.

802
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:43,390
不
No.

803
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:46,060
輪到你告訴我了
It is your turn to tell me, Clarice.

804
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:48,760
你再沒有假期可哄騙我了
You don't have any more vacations to sell.

805
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,930
為何你離開那個牧場？
Why did you leave that ranch?

806
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:56,330
我們沒有時間再玩這一套了
Doctor, we don't have any more time for any of this now.

807
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,000
但我們的時間觀念是不同的
But we don't reckon time the same way, do we?

808
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:01,040
你只有這麼多的時間
This is all the time you'll have.

809
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:03,600
稍後吧，請聽著，我們只有五個...
Later. Please listen. We've only got five...

810
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:06,940
不，我現在要聽
No! I will listen now.

811
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:11,980
父親被殺後，你十歲就成了孤兒
Your father's murder orphaned you when you were 10.

812
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:17,050
你去了蒙大拿，跟一些養羊馬的表親同住，之後呢？
You went to live with cousins on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And?

813
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:21,590
我在一個早上跑掉了
And one morning I just ran away.

814
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:25,830
不是的，什麼驅使你離開？
Not "just," Clarice. What set you off?

815
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:27,600
你在什麼時候出發？
You started at what time?

816
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:29,660
很早，天還沒亮
Early, still dark.

817
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:32,440
有東西吵醒你，是不是一個夢？
Then something woke you. Was it a dream?

818
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:33,800
是什麼？
What was it?

819
01:10:35,410 --> 01:10:37,040
我聽到一種奇怪的聲音
I heard a strange noise.

820
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:39,680
是什麼？
What was it?

821
01:10:40,350 --> 01:10:41,510
是...
It was...

822
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:44,220
尖叫聲
screaming.

823
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:48,450
像小孩的尖叫聲
Some kind of screaming, like a child's voice.

824
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,520
你怎麼做？
What did you do?

825
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,390
我下樓
I went...

826
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:55,250
走出屋外
downstairs. Outside.

827
01:10:57,530 --> 01:11:00,000
我偷進了殼倉
I crept up into the barn.

828
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:03,460
我很害怕看進去，但又必須看
I was so scared to look inside, but I had to.

829
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:07,870
你看見什麼？克麗絲？
And what did you see, Clarice? What did you see?

830
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:10,610
一些羔羊
Lambs.

831
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:13,440
它們在尖叫
They were screaming.

832
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:16,780
他們在宰殺那些羔羊？
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?

833
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:19,080
而它們在尖叫
And they were screaming.

834
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,110
那你就跑掉了？
And you ran away?

835
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:26,150
不是，最初我想釋放它們
No. First I tried to free them.

836
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,290
我打開它們的閘門
I opened the gate to their pen.

837
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,930
它們只是站在那裡，很困惑的，不肯走
They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run.

838
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:35,630
但你可以走，你也走了，是不是？
But you could and you did, didn't you?

839
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:39,840
是的，我抱起一隻羊就拔足逃跑
Yes. I took one lamb and I ran away as fast as I could.

840
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:41,800
你去哪裡？
Where were you going, Clarice?

841
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:44,980
不知道，我沒有食物和水
I don't know. I didn't have any food, any water...

842
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:47,840
而且當時很冷，非常冷
and it was very cold. It was very cold.

843
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:51,240
我以為...
I thought...

844
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:54,690
我以為，至少可救到一隻羊
I thought if I could save just one...

845
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:58,260
但它很重
but he was so heavy.

846
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:00,890
真的很重
He was so heavy.

847
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:10,070
我走不了幾里路，警長的車就把我截住
I didn't get more than a few miles when the sheriffs car picked me up.

848
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:17,540
牧場主人很生氣，把我送到博斯曼的路德會孤兒院
The rancher was so angry he sent me to a Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman.

849
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:20,280
我再沒看過那個牧場了
I never saw the ranch again.

850
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:23,740
你的羊又怎麼樣？
What became of your lamb, Clarice?

851
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:27,010
他們把它殺了
They killed him.

852
01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:29,650
有時你仍會驚醒，是嗎？
You still wake up sometimes, don't you?

853
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:31,580
在黑暗中醒來...
Wake up in the dark...

854
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:35,090
聽到那些羔羊的尖叫聲？
and hear the screaming of the lambs?

855
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:36,850
是的
Yes.

856
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:41,100
你相信如果把凱瑟琳救了出來
And you think if you save poor Catherine...

857
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,890
可以令它們停止尖叫是嗎？你相信如果凱瑟琳活著...
you can make them stop, don't you? You think if Catherine lives...

858
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:48,330
你就不會在黑夜中...
you won't wake up in the dark ever again...

859
01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:51,340
再被那些恐怖的羊聲驚醒了
to that awful screaming of the lambs.

860
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:53,910
我不知道
I don't know.

861
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:55,980
我不知道
I don't know.

862
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:00,080
謝謝你，克麗絲
Thank you, Clarice.

863
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:01,860
謝謝你
Thank you.

864
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:04,090
告訴我他的名字
Tell me his name, doctor.

865
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,360
是奇頓醫生吧
Dr. Chilton, I presume.

866
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:15,540
我相信你們是認識的
I think you know each other.

867
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:19,340
好吧
Okay.

868
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,100
-我們找到她了　-我們走吧
- We found her. - Let's go.

869
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:24,000
醫生，輪到你了
It's your turn, doctor.

870
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:26,070
-出去　-說出他的名字
- Out! - Tell me his name.

871
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:29,110
抱歉，我接到命令，要把你送上飛機
Sorry, ma'am, I've got orders to put you on a plane.

872
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:30,540
走吧
Come on, now.

873
01:13:30,890 --> 01:13:32,680
勇敢的克麗絲
Brave Clarice.

874
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:36,650
那些羔羊停止尖叫時，你會告訴我的，是嗎？
You will let me know when those lambs stop screaming, won't you?

875
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,650
說出他的名字
Tell me his name, doctor!

876
01:13:38,990 --> 01:13:40,220
克麗絲
Clarice!

877
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:43,320
你的檔案
Your case file.

878
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:46,160
餵！
Hey!

879
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,800
再見，克麗絲
Goodbye, Clarice.

880
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:57,700
醫生，準備好就來吧
Ready when you are, doc.

881
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,260
請等一會
Just another minute, please.

882
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:11,520
那個混蛋竟然要再吃晚飯
Son of a bitch demanded a second dinner.

883
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:13,510
還要極生的羊排
Lamb chops, extra rare.

884
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:18,320
不知他早餐要吃什麼？動物園裡的怪物？
Wonder what he wants for breakfast? Some damn thing from the zoo?

885
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:29,530
（化學噴霧）

886
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:41,380
兩位，晚安
Good evening, gentlemen.

887
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:43,510
好的，醫生，蹲下吧
Okay, doc. Grab some floor.

888
01:15:43,850 --> 01:15:45,840
跟以前的程序一樣
Same drill as before, please.

889
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:54,960
龐畢探員，準備好了
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

890
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:12,740
行了
Okay.

891
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:20,850
遞給我吧
Hand me that, would you?

892
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:27,750
謝謝
Thanks.

893
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:33,600
請小心那些畫
Mind the drawings, please.

894
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:37,970
謝謝你
Thank you.

895
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:05,070
龐畢，小心，他把我扣住
Pembry, watch it, he's cuffed me!

896
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,200
天啊
Jesus Christ!

897
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,450
龐畢探員，準備好就來吧
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

898
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,760
究竟什麼回事？
What is this shit?

899
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,960
有人上了五樓？
Did somebody go up on five?

900
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:53,970
-沒有人上過去　-叫龐畢，叫他告訴...
- No, nobody went up. - Call Pembry. Ask him to tell...

901
01:18:57,010 --> 01:19:01,000
CP，五樓有槍聲，重復，五樓有槍聲
CP, shots fired on five. Repeat, shots fired on five.

902
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,510
戴德警官
Sergeant Tate!

903
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:04,710
去，五樓有槍聲
Proceed. Shots fired on five.

904
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:06,940
天啊！
Holy shit!

905
01:19:07,290 --> 01:19:08,950
-怎麼了？　-混蛋！
- What the hell? - Bitch!

906
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:10,290
閉嘴！
Shut up!

907
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:11,780
波比，拿避彈衣來
Bobby, get the vest.

908
01:19:12,090 --> 01:19:13,460
是，警官
Right, sarge.

909
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:15,950
-布萊迪，霍華，掩護　-看！
- Brady, Howard, cover... - Look!

910
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:20,300
它停了
It stopped.

911
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:23,230
封鎖方圓十幢樓的範圍
Seal off a 10-block radius.

912
01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:26,370
召特種部隊和救護車來，快點！
Get me the SWAT team and an ambulance, double quick.

913
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:27,800
我們上樓去
We're going up.

914
01:19:56,940 --> 01:19:58,340
龐畢？
Pembry?!

915
01:19:59,910 --> 01:20:01,270
鮑爾？
Boyle?!

916
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:15,650
天啊！
Oh, God!

917
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:23,890
去
Go.

918
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:33,070
-沒有人　-沒有人
- Clear. - Clear.

919
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:34,670
指揮站
Command post.

920
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:36,610
兩個警員死了
Two officers down.

921
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:38,310
-沒有人　-沒有人
- Clear! - Clear!

922
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:39,970
警官，萊達不見了
Lecter's gone, sarge.

923
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:41,940
囚犯失蹤了
Prisoner is missing.

924
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:43,650
鮑爾的配槍不見了
Boyle's gun is gone.

925
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:46,490
重復，萊達持械失蹤了
Repeat. Lecter is missing and armed.

926
01:20:46,790 --> 01:20:48,450
他拿走了床鋪
He stripped the bed.

927
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:51,650
可能用來做繩，搜查所有窗戶
Might be making a rope. Check all the windows.

928
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:54,190
救護車在哪裡？
Where the fuck is my ambulance?

929
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,130
他仍活著的
He's alive.

930
01:20:56,330 --> 01:20:59,030
戴德警官，他仍活著！
Sergeant Tate! He's alive!

931
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:02,590
扶著他，撫摸他的手，跟他說話
Get ahold of him and feel his hands. Talk to him!

932
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,170
說什麼？
What do I say?

933
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:07,200
他是龐德吉姆，跟他說話，該死
It's Jim Pembry. Now talk to him, damn it!

934
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,440
萊達持械失蹤了
Lecter is missing and armed.

935
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:14,410
-龐畢...你聽到我嗎？　-他拿了鮑爾的配槍
- Pembry. Pembry, can you hear me? - He took Boyle's gun.

936
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:17,750
龐畢發過一槍，萊達可能中了槍的
Pembry got off one round. There's a chance Lecter's hit.

937
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:19,780
繼續呼吸吧
Keep breathing in and out.

938
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:23,590
你做得很好，你沒事的
You're doing a good job. You look real good there.

939
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:27,090
對，你沒事的
Yeah, you look... Look real good.

940
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:45,410
-準備了嗎？　-來吧
- You ready? - Let's go!

941
01:21:45,410 --> 01:21:47,110
-我們來吧　-好的，走吧
- Let's do it. - Okay, let's go!

942
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,620
很好，你支持得住的
Looking good. You're gonna make it.

943
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:02,730
沒事的
Everything's just fine.

944
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:05,220
-我要作靜脈注射　-乳酸林格注射液
- I need that IV now! - Lactated Ringer's.

945
01:22:05,530 --> 01:22:07,800
可否拿那條帶子來？氧氣在哪裡？
Can we get the strap? Where's the oxygen?

946
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:11,700
老兄，情況很好，鎮定一點
Doing good, buddy. That's right. Stay with me here.

947
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:15,800
他不行了，去樓下，快點
We're losing him! Downstairs, quickly!

948
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:17,640
抬起！
And up!

949
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:19,970
-電梯！　-這邊
- Elevator! - This way!

950
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:22,770
-讓開！　-讓開！
- Out of the way! - Get out of the way!

951
01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:28,150
CP叫戴德
CP to Tate.

952
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:31,150
收到，我是戴德
Roger, lieutenant. Tate here.

953
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:34,020
我現在乘電梯送龐畢下來
I'm on the elevator bringing Pembry down.

954
01:22:34,630 --> 01:22:36,430
他看來支持得住
He seems to be hanging on.

955
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:39,320
最高的三層樓封鎖了
Top three floors secured.

956
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:41,930
主要樓梯封鎖了
Main stairwell secured.

957
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:44,700
我們相信他在二樓
We think he's on two.

958
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:00,210
戴德，你聽到嗎？
Tate, you still with me?

959
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:04,290
我們頗肯定他在二樓
We're pretty sure he's somewhere on two, sir.

960
01:23:04,490 --> 01:23:06,290
通話暫時完畢
That's all for now. Over.

961
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:28,350
他在電梯頂
He's on the roof of the elevator.

962
01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:32,380
好的，大家來
Okay, guys.

963
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:49,930
我看到他
I see him.

964
01:23:50,570 --> 01:23:52,840
他的手旁邊有一支槍，他沒有動
There's a gun by his hand. He's not moving.

965
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:56,400
-警告，我們要生擒他　-知道
- One warning. We need him alive. - Got it.

966
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:58,800
萊達？
Lecter?

967
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:00,980
把雙手放在頭上
Put your hands on your head.

968
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,850
向腿射一槍
One in the leg.

969
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:17,460
沒有動靜
No movement.

970
01:24:18,830 --> 01:24:21,390
約翰，不要開槍，我們要進入電梯
Johnny, hold your fire. We're coming into the car.

971
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,490
我們會打開蓋口
We're opening the hatch.

972
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:25,300
小心他的手
Watch his hands.

973
01:24:25,670 --> 01:24:28,440
如果有開火，會是我們發的，確定
If there's any fire, it'll come from us. Affirm.

974
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:29,780
明白
Got it.

975
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,770
孟斐斯醫院，這是26號車
Memphis General, this is Unit 26.

976
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:00,610
我們會送來一名五十歲男警
We're inbound with a 50-year-old male officer...

977
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:02,930
他面部有嚴重割傷
with severe facial lacerations.

978
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:06,510
他全身出現抽搐，情況嚴重
He had grand mal seizure activity. He's postdictal now.

979
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:08,640
-收到　-重要器官情況良好
- I copy. - Vital signs are good.

980
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:10,470
-血壓是130/90　-90？
- Pressure is 130l90. - Ninety?

981
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:12,880
對，是90，脈搏84
Yeah, that's right, 90. Pulse, 84.

982
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:15,450
我們給他注射了乳酸林格注射液
We got him on lactated Ringer's running...

983
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,950
病人正在吸十公升的氧氣
and the patient is on 10 liters of oxygen.

984
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:20,250
小心！
Watch it!

985
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:27,960
那輛救護車在孟斐斯機場一個車庫里被發現
The ambulance was found in a parking garage at Memphis Airport.

986
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:29,670
工作人員死了
The crew was dead.

987
01:25:30,870 --> 01:25:32,360
他還殺了一名遊客
He killed a tourist too.

988
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:34,400
拿了他的衣服和鈔票
Got his clothes, cash.

989
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:36,600
他可能在任何地方
By now he could be anywhere.

990
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:38,810
-他不會來對付我的　-真的？
- He won't come after me. - Oh, really?

991
01:25:39,180 --> 01:25:40,200
他不會的
He won't.

992
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:42,370
我不能解釋
I can't explain it.

993
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:44,880
他認為那樣做很無禮
He would consider that rude.

994
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:47,110
都完了，她已經死了
It's over. She's dead.

995
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:48,980
這不是你的錯
It's not your fault.

996
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:53,820
萊達說，我們需要捉拿他的資料都在這裡，但我不能...
Lecter said everything we need to catch him with is here, only I can't...

997
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,790
萊達醫生說了很多話
Dr. Lecter said a lot of things.

998
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:57,820
雅戴，他在這裡的
He's here, Ardelia.

999
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:29,360
這是萊達的筆跡嗎？
Is this Lecter's handwriting?

1000
01:26:31,570 --> 01:26:35,830
這樣雜亂地分布現場，不是有點極度隨意嗎？
"Doesn't this random scattering of sites seem desperately random?

1001
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:39,770
像個差勁說謊者的精心策劃？漢尼拔・萊達
Like the elaboration of a bad liar? Ta. Hannibal Lecter."

1002
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:43,010
「極度隨意」，他是什麼意思？
"Desperately random." What does he mean?

1003
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:46,110
可能根本不是隨意，是有一個模式的
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's a pattern here.

1004
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:50,510
但並沒有模式，不然電腦也會發現
But there's no pattern or the computers would've nailed it.

1005
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:53,120
屍體甚至是不依次序被發現的
They're even found in random order.

1006
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:57,120
不依次序是因為那個被他沈下的女孩
Random because of the one girl. The one he weighted down.

1007
01:26:57,730 --> 01:26:59,450
-費迪嘉・拜姆　-對
- Fredrica Bimmel. - Right.

1008
01:26:59,830 --> 01:27:03,060
來自俄亥俄州的貝爾維迪爾
From Belvedere, Ohio.

1009
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:06,800
第一個遇害的女孩，屍體是第三個被發現，為什麼？
The first girl taken, third body found. Why?

1010
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:09,160
她沒有漂浮，他把她沈下去
She didn't drift. He weighted her down.

1011
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:12,700
萊達說的首要原則是什麼？
What did Lecter say about the "first principles"?

1012
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:14,470
簡易
Simplicity.

1013
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:17,940
這個傢伙做什麼？他貪圖
What does this guy do? He covets.

1014
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:20,610
我們怎樣開始貪圖的？
How do we first start to covet?

1015
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:22,510
我們貪圖見到的東西
We covet what we see.

1016
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:24,340
每天見到的
Every day.

1017
01:27:26,490 --> 01:27:27,610
該死，克麗絲
Hot damn, Clarice.

1018
01:27:28,190 --> 01:27:29,350
他認識她的
He knew her.

1019
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:38,120
（俄亥俄州貝爾維迪爾市）

1020
01:28:44,870 --> 01:28:46,130
貝先生？
Mr. Bimmel?

1021
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:47,590
我是
That's me.

1022
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:50,560
你好，我是克麗絲・史達琳，聯邦調查局探員
Hello, I'm Clarice Starling. I'm with the FBI.

1023
01:28:54,610 --> 01:28:57,770
貝先生，我想四周看看
I appreciate you letting me take a look around, Mr. Bimmel.

1024
01:28:58,350 --> 01:29:00,370
我沒有什麼新資料給你了
I don't know nothing new to tell you.

1025
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:03,480
警方已經來過很多次
Police been back here so many times already.

1026
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:08,080
費迪坐巴士去芝加哥求職
Fredrica went into Chicago on the bus to see about a job.

1027
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,220
她好端端的離開面試
She left the interview okay.

1028
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:11,820
就沒有回家
She never come home.

1029
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,850
她的臥房是原封不動的
Her bedroom's how she left it.

1030
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:18,230
在樓上
Upstairs.

1031
01:29:19,070 --> 01:29:20,430
左邊那一間
Door to the left.

1032
01:32:05,630 --> 01:32:09,120
他在替自己做女裝，用真的女人做
He's making himself a woman suit. Out of real women!

1033
01:32:09,470 --> 01:32:10,460
他還懂得縫紉
And he can sew!

1034
01:32:10,740 --> 01:32:13,570
他很熟練，他是個裁縫或...
He's very skilled. He's a tailor or a dressmaker or...

1035
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:15,570
-史達琳！　-所以她們都身材肥大
- Starling! - That's why they're big.

1036
01:32:15,910 --> 01:32:18,040
他讓她們活著，逼使她們挨餓
He keeps them alive so he can starve them...

1037
01:32:18,350 --> 01:32:19,680
令她們的皮膚鬆弛，然後...
loosen their skin and...

1038
01:32:19,980 --> 01:32:22,380
史達琳，我們知道他的身份和下落
Starling! We know who and where he is!

1039
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:24,080
我們快到達了
We're on our way right now.

1040
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:27,150
-哪裡？　-芝加哥卡柳梅特城
- Where? - Calumet City, edge of Chicago.

1041
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,990
我45分鐘後會和飛虎隊降落
Be on the ground in 45 minutes with HRT.

1042
01:32:30,290 --> 01:32:32,380
好消息，但怎麼...
That's great news, sir. But how...?

1043
01:32:32,690 --> 01:32:36,150
我們把約翰・霍金斯提供的名字，輸入已知犯人的檔案
We fed the names Johns Hopkins came up with into Known Offenders.

1044
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:40,260
他叫傑米・甘姆，又名約翰・格蘭
Subject's name is Jamie Gumb, a.k.a. John Grant.

1045
01:32:40,630 --> 01:32:44,200
萊達的描述是正確的，他只是捏造那個名字
Lecter's description was accurate. He just lied about the name.

1046
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:45,870
海關有些關於他的資料
Customs had some paper on him.

1047
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:49,840
兩年前他們在洛杉磯機場，查到一個紙箱
They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX.

1048
01:32:50,110 --> 01:32:52,100
是一些來自蘇里南的活毛蟲
Live caterpillars from Suriname.

1049
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:55,210
收件人叫詹米・甘姆
The addressee was a Jame Gumb.

1050
01:32:55,950 --> 01:32:58,680
芝加哥離這裡只有四百哩，我很快...
Chicago is only 400 miles from here. I'll be there in...

1051
01:32:59,050 --> 01:33:00,610
不，沒有時間了
No, there's not enough time.

1052
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:03,050
我們要控告他謀殺，不是綁架
We want him for murder, not kidnapping.

1053
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,520
在起訴他前，要找出他與費迪嘉・拜姆的關係
Link him to Bimmel before he's indicted.

1054
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:09,790
-你去貝爾維迪爾看有什麼發現　-知道，我會盡力的
- See what you can find in Belvedere. - Yes, sir. You bet. I'll do my best.

1055
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:11,160
史達琳
Starling.

1056
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:15,160
沒有你我們就找不到他，大家都會記著這點
We wouldn't have found him without you. Nobody will forget that.

1057
01:33:16,070 --> 01:33:17,540
尤其是我
Least of all me.

1058
01:33:18,740 --> 01:33:19,800
謝謝，長官
Thank you, sir.

1059
01:33:20,110 --> 01:33:22,340
謝謝你，葛先生
Thank you very much, Mr. Crawford.

1060
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:25,040
葛先生？
Mr. Crawford?

1061
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:39,850
混蛋，謝謝那些冷飯菜汁
Thanks for the scraps, asshole.

1062
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:42,020
我有更好的主意
I got a better idea.

1063
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:06,070
