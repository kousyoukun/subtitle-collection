Starling£¡

3
00:02:55,204 --> 00:02:57,468
Crawford wants to see you
in his office

4
00:02:58,441 --> 00:02:59,533
Thank you, sir

5
00:03:47,723 --> 00:03:49,122
£­Clarice.
£­Hey

6
00:04:40,076 --> 00:04:41,338
Looking for Crawford?

7
00:04:41,544 --> 00:04:44,741
He should be back soon.
Why don't you wait in his office?

8
00:05:41,971 --> 00:05:43,404
Starling

9
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:47,574
£­Clarice M.  Good morning.
£­Morning, Mr. Crawford

10
00:05:47,777 --> 00:05:51,076
Sorry to pull you off the course
at such short notice

11
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,215
Your instructors say you're
in the top quarter of your class

12
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:57,746
I hope so.  They haven't posted
any grades yet

13
00:05:58,154 --> 00:06:00,520
A job's come up,
and I thought about you

14
00:06:00,723 --> 00:06:03,351
Not a job, really,
more of an interesting errand

15
00:06:03,626 --> 00:06:04,752
Sit down

16
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:06,316
Yes, sir

17
00:06:07,196 --> 00:06:09,790
I remember you from my seminar at UVA

18
00:06:12,634 --> 00:06:16,001
You grilled me on the bureau's civil
rights record in the Hoover years

19
00:06:16,205 --> 00:06:17,194
I gave you an A

20
00:06:17,673 --> 00:06:18,799
A minus, sir

21
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,738
Double major, psych and criminology,
graduated magna

22
00:06:24,947 --> 00:06:27,711
Summer internships
at the Reitzinger Clinic

23
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:32,683
It says when you graduate you want
to work for me in Behavioral Science

24
00:06:32,955 --> 00:06:34,946
Yes, very much, sir.  Very much

25
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:38,959
We're interviewing
all serial killers in custody¡­

26
00:06:39,161 --> 00:06:40,992
¡­for a psycho£­behavioral profile

27
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,990
It could be a real help
in unsolved cases

28
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:46,759
Most of them have been happy
to talk to us

29
00:06:47,302 --> 00:06:48,894
Do you spook easily, Starling?

30
00:06:49,772 --> 00:06:51,034
Not yet, sir

31
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,135
The one we want most refuses to help

32
00:06:54,343 --> 00:06:56,777
I want you to go after him
in the asylum

33
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,610
Who's the subject?

34
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:03,284
£­The psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter.
£­¡°Hannibal the Cannibal.¡±

35
00:07:03,986 --> 00:07:06,079
I don't expect him to talk to you¡­

36
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,290
¡­but I have to be able
to say we tried

37
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:13,457
If he won't cooperate,
I want straight reporting

38
00:07:13,662 --> 00:07:15,493
How's he look?  How's his cell?

39
00:07:15,697 --> 00:07:19,258
Is he sketching, drawing?
If he is, what's he sketching?

40
00:07:23,105 --> 00:07:25,767
Here's a dossier on Lecter¡­

41
00:07:27,976 --> 00:07:30,945
¡­copy of our questionnaire
and an I.D. for you

42
00:07:31,613 --> 00:07:34,138
Have your memo on my desk
by 0800, Wednesday

43
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:35,509
Okay

44
00:07:38,086 --> 00:07:41,112
Excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?

45
00:07:41,323 --> 00:07:43,052
Lecter's been in prison for years

46
00:07:43,258 --> 00:07:46,352
Is there some connection
between him and Buffalo Bill?

47
00:07:46,562 --> 00:07:50,396
I wish there were.  Now, I want
your full attention, Starling

48
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:55,025
£­Yes, sir.
£­Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter

49
00:07:55,537 --> 00:07:59,667
Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over
all the physical procedures used

50
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:03,770
Do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever

51
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:06,038
You're to tell him nothing personal

52
00:08:06,682 --> 00:08:09,651
You don't want Hannibal Lecter
inside your head

53
00:08:10,352 --> 00:08:13,014
Just do your job
but never forget what he is

54
00:08:13,489 --> 00:08:14,581
And what is that?

55
00:08:15,257 --> 00:08:18,954
Oh, he's a monster, a pure psychopath

56
00:08:19,528 --> 00:08:21,553
It's so rare to capture one alive

57
00:08:21,763 --> 00:08:25,790
From a research point of view,
Lecter is our most prized asset

58
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:31,696
We get a lot of detectives here¡­

59
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:35,172
¡­but I must say I can't remember
one as attractive

60
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:40,212
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?

61
00:08:40,415 --> 00:08:44,181
Because this can be quite a fun town
if you have the right guide

62
00:08:45,587 --> 00:08:48,954
I'm sure this is a great town,
Dr. Chilton¡­

63
00:08:49,157 --> 00:08:53,025
¡­but I must talk to Dr. Lecter
and report back this afternoon

64
00:08:53,395 --> 00:08:56,796
I see.  Well, let's make
this quick, then

65
00:08:57,099 --> 00:09:01,559
We've tried to study him, but he's too
sophisticated for the standard tests

66
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,000
Oh, my, does he hate us

67
00:09:04,206 --> 00:09:06,299
He thinks I'm his nemesis

68
00:09:07,876 --> 00:09:10,504
Crawford's very clever,
isn't he, using you?

69
00:09:10,812 --> 00:09:15,112
-What do you mean, sir?
£­Pretty young woman to turn him on

70
00:09:15,617 --> 00:09:20,554
I don't believe Lecter's seen a woman
in eight years, and you are his taste

71
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:22,254
So to speak

72
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:25,392
I graduated from UVA.
It's not a charm school

73
00:09:25,594 --> 00:09:28,859
Good.  Then you should be able
to remember the rules

74
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:35,601
Do not touch or approach the glass.
Pass him nothing but soft paper

75
00:09:35,804 --> 00:09:39,535
No pencils or pens, no staples
or paper clips in his paper

76
00:09:39,741 --> 00:09:42,073
Use the sliding food carrier,
no exceptions

77
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:44,472
If he passes you anything,
do not accept

78
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,148
£­Do you understand?
£­Yes, I understand, sir

79
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,710
I'm going to show you why we insist
on such precautions

80
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,388
On the afternoon of July 8, 1981 ¡­

81
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,491
¡­he complained of chest pains
and was taken to the dispensary

82
00:09:57,693 --> 00:10:00,161
His mouthpiece was removed for an EKG

83
00:10:00,362 --> 00:10:03,354
When the nurse leaned over him,
he did this to her

84
00:10:06,134 --> 00:10:10,537
The doctors managed to reset her jaw,
more or less.  Save one of her eyes

85
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,635
His pulse never got above 85,
even when he ate her tongue

86
00:10:16,445 --> 00:10:19,778
£­I keep him in here.
£­Dr. Chilton

87
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:25,944
If Lecter feels
that you're his enemy, then¡­.

88
00:10:26,154 --> 00:10:28,554
Maybe we'll have more luck
if I go by myself

89
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,255
What do you think?

90
00:10:33,161 --> 00:10:36,892
You might have suggested this
in my office and saved me the time

91
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,361
Yes, sir, but then I would have missed
the pleasure of your company, sir

92
00:10:45,607 --> 00:10:47,575
When she's finished, bring her out

93
00:11:16,238 --> 00:11:20,732
Hi, I'm Barney.  He told you,
don't get near the glass?

94
00:11:21,343 --> 00:11:23,208
Yes, he did.  Clarice Starling

95
00:11:24,046 --> 00:11:27,072
Nice to meet you.  You can hang
your coat there if you like

96
00:11:27,282 --> 00:11:29,477
Okay.  Thank you, I will

97
00:11:31,553 --> 00:11:34,113
He's past the others.
The last cell

98
00:11:34,322 --> 00:11:36,085
You keep to the right

99
00:11:38,493 --> 00:11:41,929
£­I put out a chair for you.
£­Yes, that's very good, thank you

100
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:47,235
I'll be watching.  You'll do fine

101
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:19,423
I can smell your cunt

102
00:12:33,548 --> 00:12:34,537
Good morning

103
00:12:35,183 --> 00:12:39,319
Dr. Lecter, my name is Clarice
Starling.  May I speak with you?

104
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:41,651
You're one of Jack Crawford's,
aren't you?

105
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:43,215
I am, yes

106
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,358
May I see your credentials?

107
00:12:47,027 --> 00:12:48,016
Certainly

108
00:12:55,268 --> 00:12:56,860
Closer, please

109
00:12:58,772 --> 00:13:00,296
Closer

110
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:20,783
That expires in one week.
You're not real FBI, are you?

111
00:13:21,261 --> 00:13:23,729
I'm still in training at the academy

112
00:13:24,931 --> 00:13:29,868
£­Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
£­Yes, I'm a student

113
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:32,094
I'm here to learn from you

114
00:13:32,305 --> 00:13:35,502
Maybe you can decide
if I'm qualified enough to do that

115
00:13:38,945 --> 00:13:42,039
That is rather slippery of you,
Agent Starling

116
00:13:45,585 --> 00:13:47,246
Sit.  Please

117
00:13:54,661 --> 00:13:58,620
Now then, tell me.
What did Miggs say to you?

118
00:13:58,832 --> 00:14:01,426
¡°Multiple Miggs¡± in the next cell

119
00:14:01,635 --> 00:14:04,763
He hissed at you.  What did he say?

120
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:09,108
He said, ¡°I can smell your cunt.¡±

121
00:14:09,476 --> 00:14:10,738
I see

122
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,104
I myself cannot

123
00:14:23,156 --> 00:14:25,818
You use Evyan skin cream

124
00:14:28,295 --> 00:14:31,230
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps

125
00:14:32,632 --> 00:14:34,156
But not today

126
00:14:36,436 --> 00:14:38,233
Did you do all these drawings?

127
00:14:41,308 --> 00:14:44,675
That is the Duomo, seen
from the Belvedere

128
00:14:46,046 --> 00:14:47,707
Do you know Florence?

129
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:50,650
All that detail just from memory, sir?

130
00:14:50,951 --> 00:14:55,445
Memory, Agent Starling, is what
I have instead of a view

131
00:14:56,156 --> 00:15:00,752
Perhaps you'd care to lend us
your view on this questionnaire, sir

132
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:05,398
No, no, no.  You were doing fine

133
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:08,591
You had been courteous
and receptive to courtesy

134
00:15:08,802 --> 00:15:13,262
You had established trust with
the embarrassing truth about Miggs

135
00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:18,137
And now this ham£­handed segue
into your questionnaire

136
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:20,744
It won't do

137
00:15:21,148 --> 00:15:25,084
I'm only asking you to look at this.
Either you will or you won't

138
00:15:25,318 --> 00:15:28,947
Yeah.  Jack Crawford must be
very busy indeed¡­

139
00:15:29,156 --> 00:15:31,681
¡­if he's recruiting help
from the student body

140
00:15:32,092 --> 00:15:34,754
Busy hunting that new one,
Buffalo Bill

141
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:37,259
What a naughty boy he is

142
00:15:37,664 --> 00:15:40,929
Do you know why he's called
¡°Buffalo Bill¡±?

143
00:15:41,134 --> 00:15:44,467
Please tell me.
The newspapers won't say

144
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:47,937
It started as a joke
in Kansas City Homicide

145
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:52,373
They said, ¡°This one likes
to skin his humps.¡±

146
00:15:53,713 --> 00:15:55,010
Why do you think¡­

147
00:15:55,215 --> 00:15:59,015
¡­he removes their skins,
Agent Starling?

148
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:01,483
Thrill me with your acumen

149
00:16:02,255 --> 00:16:03,847
It excites him

150
00:16:04,057 --> 00:16:07,117
Most serial killers keep
trophies from their victims

151
00:16:07,894 --> 00:16:10,021
£­I didn't.
£­No

152
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,897
No, you ate yours

153
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:16,668
You send that through now

154
00:16:43,797 --> 00:16:48,166
You think you can dissect
me with this blunt little tool?

155
00:16:48,969 --> 00:16:51,767
No£¡  I thought
that your knowledge£­£­

156
00:16:51,972 --> 00:16:54,270
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

157
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:58,268
You know what you look like, with
your good bag and your cheap shoes?

158
00:16:58,478 --> 00:16:59,911
You look like a rube

159
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,710
A well£­scrubbed, hustling rube
with a little taste

160
00:17:05,518 --> 00:17:07,748
Nutrition has given you
some length of bone¡­

161
00:17:07,954 --> 00:17:11,117
¡­but you're not more than one
generation from white trash¡­

162
00:17:11,324 --> 00:17:13,155
¡­are you, Agent Starling?

163
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,158
The accent you've tried
so desperately to shed¡­

164
00:17:16,363 --> 00:17:18,422
¡­pure West Virginia

165
00:17:18,632 --> 00:17:20,691
Is your father a coal miner?

166
00:17:20,901 --> 00:17:22,630
Does he stink of the lamp?

167
00:17:22,969 --> 00:17:27,702
I know how quickly the boys found you,
all those tedious, sticky fumblings¡­

168
00:17:27,908 --> 00:17:31,344
¡­in the back seats of cars,
while you dreamed of getting out

169
00:17:31,544 --> 00:17:32,909
Getting anywhere

170
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:36,740
Getting all the way to the FBI

171
00:17:40,053 --> 00:17:42,851
You see a lot, doctor

172
00:17:43,056 --> 00:17:45,524
But are you strong enough
to point that¡­

173
00:17:45,725 --> 00:17:48,250
¡­high£­powered
perception at yourself?

174
00:17:49,262 --> 00:17:50,388
What about it?

175
00:17:50,597 --> 00:17:54,761
Why don't you look at yourself
and write down what you see?

176
00:17:54,968 --> 00:17:56,697
Or maybe you're afraid to

177
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:09,346
A census taker once tried to test me

178
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:12,882
I ate his liver
with some fava beans¡­

179
00:18:13,086 --> 00:18:15,384
¡­and a nice Chianti

180
00:18:24,197 --> 00:18:26,563
You fly back to school now,
little Starling

181
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:28,957
Fly, fly, fly

182
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,850
I bit my wrist¡­

183
00:18:46,086 --> 00:18:49,522
¡­so I could die

184
00:18:49,522 --> 00:18:50,784
Look at the blood£¡

185
00:18:51,724 --> 00:18:53,123
Gotcha

186
00:18:53,526 --> 00:18:55,619
Miggs£¡  You stupid fuck£¡

187
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:04,001
Agent Starling£¡  Come back£¡
Agent Starling£¡  Agent Starling£¡

188
00:19:04,203 --> 00:19:07,297
I would not have had that happen.
Discourtesy is ugly to me

189
00:19:07,507 --> 00:19:09,941
£­Then do this test£¡
£­No, but I will make you happy

190
00:19:10,143 --> 00:19:12,668
£­I'll give you a chance at your love.
-What?

191
00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:17,646
Advancement.  Listen.  Look deep
within yourself, Clarice Starling

192
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:22,048
Go seek out Miss Mofet,
an old patient of mine.  M£­O£­F£­E£­T

193
00:19:22,355 --> 00:19:24,880
I don't think Miggs could
manage again so soon¡­

194
00:19:25,091 --> 00:19:27,321
¡­even though he is crazy.
Go now£¡

195
00:20:08,835 --> 00:20:10,029
Hi, Bill

196
00:20:14,807 --> 00:20:16,536
£­Daddy£¡
£­Hey, Clarice

197
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,307
£­Did you get any bad guys, Daddy?
£­No, angel.  They all got away

198
00:20:24,517 --> 00:20:26,007
Ah, shoot

199
00:20:46,372 --> 00:20:48,636
FBI£¡  Hands up£¡  Don't move£¡

200
00:20:48,841 --> 00:20:52,368
Turn around.  Hands behind your back.
Thumbs up

201
00:20:56,382 --> 00:20:58,179
You're dead, Starling

202
00:20:58,718 --> 00:21:02,848
Johnson, good entry, good command.
Starling, where's your danger area?

203
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:04,454
£­In the corner.
£­Did you check it?

204
00:21:04,657 --> 00:21:06,249
£­No, sir.
£­That's why you're dead

205
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,585
3£­1 £­0£­9?

206
00:21:09,796 --> 00:21:14,233
Breaking doors or windows
to enter or exit

207
00:21:15,201 --> 00:21:16,463
Rule 404?

208
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:37,653
Clarice, phone.  It's the guru

209
00:21:37,857 --> 00:21:39,484
Crawford?  Thanks, Ardelia

210
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:42,393
£­Starling?
-sir

211
00:21:42,595 --> 00:21:44,028
Miggs is dead

212
00:21:45,198 --> 00:21:46,187
Dead?

213
00:21:47,066 --> 00:21:48,294
How?

214
00:21:49,035 --> 00:21:52,095
The orderly heard Lecter whispering
to him all afternoon

215
00:21:52,305 --> 00:21:54,899
They found him at bed check.
He'd swallowed his tongue

216
00:21:57,944 --> 00:21:59,036
Starling?

217
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:02,605
Yeah.  I'm still here, sir.  I just£­£­

218
00:22:02,815 --> 00:22:04,544
I don't know how to feel about this

219
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:08,553
You don't have to feel any way.
Lecter did it to amuse himself

220
00:22:09,889 --> 00:22:11,823
Look, I know it got ugly today¡­

221
00:22:12,358 --> 00:22:16,692
¡­but you mentioned a name,
¡°Mofet.¡±  Any follow£­up on her?

222
00:22:18,331 --> 00:22:21,494
He destroyed most of his patients'
histories prior to capture¡­

223
00:22:21,701 --> 00:22:25,193
¡­so there's no record
of anyone named Mofet

224
00:22:25,404 --> 00:22:29,500
But I thought the ¡°yourself¡± reference
was too hokey for Lecter¡­

225
00:22:29,709 --> 00:22:33,873
¡­so I figured he's from Baltimore,
and I looked in the phone book

226
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,345
And there's a
¡°Your Self¡± storage facility¡­

227
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:40,041
¡­right outside
of downtown Baltimore, sir

228
00:22:42,255 --> 00:22:44,485
Unit 31 was leased¡­

229
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,955
¡­for 10 years, prepaid in full

230
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,094
The contract was in the name¡­

231
00:22:50,296 --> 00:22:54,062
¡­of a Miss Hester Mofet

232
00:22:54,267 --> 00:22:56,895
So nobody's been
in here since 1980?

233
00:22:57,103 --> 00:22:58,900
Not to my knowledge

234
00:22:59,472 --> 00:23:03,238
Privacy is a great concern
to my customers

235
00:23:03,976 --> 00:23:06,069
Yes, I won't disturb anything,
I promise

236
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:08,304
I'll be out of here
before you know it

237
00:23:08,848 --> 00:23:11,146
£­May I help you?
£­Yes, actually

238
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:12,506
Here

239
00:23:17,456 --> 00:23:21,051
£­It's stuck.
-We could return tomorrow with my son

240
00:23:21,861 --> 00:23:23,351
What about him?

241
00:23:24,764 --> 00:23:29,701
I would ask my driver to help you,
but he detests physical labor

242
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:31,427
Right

243
00:23:32,138 --> 00:23:34,766
You stay here.
I'll be back in one minute

244
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:10,000
It's stuck.  Will you hand me
that flashlight?

245
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,188
If this door should fall down¡­

246
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:30,161
¡­or anything else¡­

247
00:24:30,363 --> 00:24:32,627
¡­this is the number
for our Baltimore office

248
00:24:33,165 --> 00:24:34,792
They know that you're with me

249
00:24:35,101 --> 00:24:38,696
£­Call them if anything should happen.
£­Yes, Miss Starling

250
00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:12,514
Clarice.  Here, they're waiting
for you

251
00:27:12,725 --> 00:27:14,249
Watch your step

252
00:27:15,461 --> 00:27:19,488
Hester Mofet.  It's an anagram,
isn't it, doctor?

253
00:27:19,699 --> 00:27:22,691
Hester Mofet£º  ¡°The rest of me¡±?

254
00:27:23,102 --> 00:27:27,038
¡°Miss The Rest Of Me,¡± meaning
that you rented that garage?

255
00:28:02,876 --> 00:28:03,900
Thank you

256
00:28:05,111 --> 00:28:06,442
Your bleeding has stopped

257
00:28:08,948 --> 00:28:10,108
How did¡­?

258
00:28:12,118 --> 00:28:13,142
It's nothing

259
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,353
It's just a scratch

260
00:28:16,956 --> 00:28:19,220
Dr. Lecter, whose head
is in that bottle?

261
00:28:19,425 --> 00:28:22,553
Why don't you ask me
about Buffalo Bill?

262
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:24,456
Do you know something about him?

263
00:28:24,697 --> 00:28:28,394
I might if I saw the case file.
You could get that for me

264
00:28:28,968 --> 00:28:31,937
Let's talk about Miss Mofet.
You wanted me to find him

265
00:28:33,072 --> 00:28:38,066
His real name is Benjamin Raspail.
A former patient of mine¡­

266
00:28:38,645 --> 00:28:43,207
¡­whose romantic attachments
ran to, shall we say, the exotic

267
00:28:43,783 --> 00:28:48,015
I did not kill him, merely tucked
him away, very much as I found him¡­

268
00:28:48,221 --> 00:28:50,587
¡­after he'd missed
three appointments

269
00:28:51,824 --> 00:28:53,883
If you didn't kill him, who did?

270
00:28:54,294 --> 00:28:57,195
Who can say?
Best thing for him, really

271
00:28:57,397 --> 00:28:59,797
His therapy was going nowhere

272
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,394
His dress, makeup¡­.

273
00:29:03,836 --> 00:29:05,428
Raspail was a transvestite?

274
00:29:05,638 --> 00:29:10,302
In life?  Oh, no.
Garden variety manic£­depressive

275
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,978
Tedious, very tedious

276
00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:15,579
I now think of him as an experiment

277
00:29:15,815 --> 00:29:19,307
A fledgling killer's first effort
at transformation

278
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:22,317
How did you feel when you saw him,
Clarice?

279
00:29:22,689 --> 00:29:24,623
Scared at first, then¡­

280
00:29:25,692 --> 00:29:26,989
¡­exhilarated

281
00:29:27,627 --> 00:29:29,822
Jack Crawford is helping your career,
isn't he?

282
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:32,759
Apparently, he likes you
and you like him too

283
00:29:33,533 --> 00:29:35,228
I never thought about it

284
00:29:35,802 --> 00:29:38,430
Do you think Jack Crawford
wants you, sexually?

285
00:29:38,638 --> 00:29:43,769
He is much older, but do you think
he visualizes scenarios, exchanges?

286
00:29:43,977 --> 00:29:45,137
Fucking you?

287
00:29:48,214 --> 00:29:53,311
That doesn't interest me.  It's the
sort of thing that Miggs would say

288
00:29:55,355 --> 00:29:56,879
Not anymore

289
00:30:04,497 --> 00:30:06,124
Thank you, Barney

290
00:30:10,036 --> 00:30:12,027
What happened to your drawings?

291
00:30:13,673 --> 00:30:18,042
Punishment, you see, for Miggs.
Just like that gospel program

292
00:30:18,378 --> 00:30:21,142
When you leave, they'll turn
the volume way up

293
00:30:21,481 --> 00:30:24,644
Dr. Chilton does enjoy
his petty torments

294
00:30:25,451 --> 00:30:27,681
What did you mean
by ¡°transformation,¡± doctor?

295
00:30:36,829 --> 00:30:40,196
I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice

296
00:30:40,533 --> 00:30:43,934
I know they will never
ever let me out while I'm alive

297
00:30:44,771 --> 00:30:46,898
What I want is a view

298
00:30:47,106 --> 00:30:50,906
I want a window where I can see a tree
or even water

299
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:54,739
I want to be in a federal institution
far away from Dr. Chilton

300
00:30:54,947 --> 00:30:57,313
What did you mean
by ¡°fledgling killer¡±?

301
00:30:57,517 --> 00:30:59,348
Are you saying he's killed again?

302
00:30:59,652 --> 00:31:02,849
I'm offering you a psychological
profile on Buffalo Bill¡­

303
00:31:03,056 --> 00:31:05,149
¡­based on the case evidence

304
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:19,672
I'll help you catch him, Clarice

305
00:31:19,672 --> 00:31:21,731
You know who he is, don't you?

306
00:31:22,608 --> 00:31:25,338
Tell me who decapitated
your patient, doctor

307
00:31:25,544 --> 00:31:28,342
All good things to those who wait

308
00:31:28,814 --> 00:31:32,910
I've waited, Clarice.  But how long
can you and old Jackie£­boy wait?

309
00:31:33,486 --> 00:31:38,651
Our little Billy must already be
searching for that next special lady

310
00:32:41,821 --> 00:32:43,914
Hey, little cheeper

311
00:32:52,331 --> 00:32:53,923
I'll be right there

312
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:14,549
Jeez£¡

313
00:33:20,659 --> 00:33:22,320
Can I help you with that?

314
00:33:23,462 --> 00:33:24,429
Would you?

315
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:25,722
Sure

316
00:33:26,499 --> 00:33:27,329
Thank you

317
00:33:27,533 --> 00:33:29,831
That's all right.  You look
kind of handicapped

318
00:33:30,036 --> 00:33:34,029
Yeah.  I got it this far, I just can't
get it up in the truck by myself

319
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,105
Here, grab this.  Up£¡

320
00:33:36,442 --> 00:33:37,500
Okay

321
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:40,110
Just set it down.  That's good

322
00:33:40,312 --> 00:33:44,112
Get in the truck.  I want to
push it all the way up

323
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:46,409
I really appreciate this.
Thank you

324
00:33:48,621 --> 00:33:50,987
Just go all the way back

325
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:53,255
Okay.  Is this good?

326
00:33:53,459 --> 00:33:55,290
Yeah, that's good

327
00:33:56,729 --> 00:33:58,492
£­That's great.
£­Okay

328
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:01,822
Say, are you
about a size 14?

329
00:34:02,034 --> 00:34:03,194
Sorry?

330
00:34:24,457 --> 00:34:25,754
Good

331
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:48,039
Oh, good.  Good

332
00:35:03,596 --> 00:35:04,995
Holds!

333
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,092
Ones£¡

334
00:35:17,243 --> 00:35:18,870
Starling£¡

335
00:35:21,213 --> 00:35:23,681
Outside.  Let's go

336
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:27,450
Cindy, in the ring for Starling.
Let's go£¡

337
00:35:37,263 --> 00:35:38,560
Pack your field gear

338
00:35:38,764 --> 00:35:40,459
£­You're going with Crawford.
-Where?

339
00:35:40,666 --> 00:35:42,327
Found a girl's body
in West Virginia

340
00:35:42,535 --> 00:35:45,231
Been in the water a week.
Looks like Buffalo Bill

341
00:35:57,316 --> 00:36:00,342
Keeps them alive for three days.
We don't know why

342
00:36:00,553 --> 00:36:03,647
No evidence of rape or
physical abuse prior to death

343
00:36:03,856 --> 00:36:06,347
All the mutilation you see
there is postmortem

344
00:36:07,092 --> 00:36:09,083
Okay, three days¡­

345
00:36:09,295 --> 00:36:12,526
¡­then he shoots them, skins them
and dumps them

346
00:36:12,731 --> 00:36:14,426
Each body in a different river

347
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:17,761
The water leaves us no trace
evidence of any kind

348
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,404
That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one

349
00:36:20,606 --> 00:36:23,473
Her body was the only one he
weighted down

350
00:36:23,676 --> 00:36:26,509
So actually, she was
the third girl found

351
00:36:26,712 --> 00:36:28,942
After her, he got lazy

352
00:36:30,749 --> 00:36:33,513
Okay, let's see

353
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:37,917
Circles where the girls were abducted.
Arrows where their bodies were found

354
00:36:38,123 --> 00:36:43,186
This new one today washed up here.
Elk River, West Virginia

355
00:37:02,815 --> 00:37:05,579
Look at him, Starling.
Tell me what you see

356
00:37:06,785 --> 00:37:08,252
Well, he's a white male

357
00:37:08,454 --> 00:37:11,423
Serial killers tend to hunt
within their own ethnic groups

358
00:37:12,224 --> 00:37:16,558
He's not a drifter.  He's got his
own house, not an apartment

359
00:37:17,096 --> 00:37:20,429
-Why?
-What he does with them takes privacy

360
00:37:20,633 --> 00:37:25,070
He's in his 30s or 40s.
He's got real physical strength

361
00:37:25,271 --> 00:37:30,607
Combined with an older man's
self£­control.  He's cautious, precise

362
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,904
And he's never impulsive.
He'll never stop

363
00:37:34,647 --> 00:37:37,282
Why not?

364
00:37:37,282 --> 00:37:40,911
He's got a real taste for it now,
and he's getting better at his work

365
00:37:42,621 --> 00:37:45,419
Not bad, Starling.  Questions?

366
00:37:45,957 --> 00:37:47,424
Yes, sir

367
00:37:47,626 --> 00:37:51,392
You haven't mentioned anything about
the information in my report¡­

368
00:37:51,596 --> 00:37:52,995
¡­or Dr. Lecter's offer, sir

369
00:37:53,198 --> 00:37:54,995
I'm considering it

370
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,135
That's why you sent me
in there, isn't it?

371
00:37:58,336 --> 00:38:00,395
To get his help on Buffalo Bill, sir?

372
00:38:03,508 --> 00:38:06,170
Well, if that was the case, then¡­

373
00:38:06,378 --> 00:38:09,142
¡­I just wish I was in on it,
that's all

374
00:38:09,347 --> 00:38:13,443
If I'd sent you in there with a real
agenda, Lecter would have known it

375
00:38:13,652 --> 00:38:17,281
He would have toyed with you,
then turned to stone

376
00:38:50,822 --> 00:38:52,619
Excuse me, Sheriff Perkins?

377
00:38:52,824 --> 00:38:54,086
These are the FBI people

378
00:38:54,292 --> 00:38:59,355
Sheriff Perkins, Jack Crawford, FBI.
Special Agent Terry, Agent Starling

379
00:38:59,564 --> 00:39:02,226
We appreciate being invited
to your jurisdiction

380
00:39:02,434 --> 00:39:05,665
Somebody from the state attorney's
office called you

381
00:39:05,871 --> 00:39:07,930
We'll extend you every courtesy,
but right now£­£­

382
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:09,401
Sheriff¡­

383
00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:14,874
¡­this type of sex crime has aspects
I'd just as soon discuss in private

384
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,672
Know what I mean?

385
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:09,959
Oscar, fetch Dr. Akin
from the chapel

386
00:41:10,161 --> 00:41:11,185
We're back here

387
00:41:11,396 --> 00:41:14,559
Tell Lamar to come on when
he's finished playing his music

388
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:17,233
Yeah, we'll be sending in a minute

389
00:41:18,403 --> 00:41:20,337
It's working

390
00:41:20,538 --> 00:41:23,837
I need a six-way link up.
Chicago, Detroit£­£­

391
00:41:24,042 --> 00:41:25,441
What?  What?

392
00:41:30,382 --> 00:41:32,077
Excuse me

393
00:41:32,283 --> 00:41:35,548
Excuse me, officers and gentlemen.
Listen here, now

394
00:41:35,754 --> 00:41:37,949
There's things we need to do
for her

395
00:41:38,156 --> 00:41:41,683
Y'all brought her this far, and her
folks would thank you if they could¡­

396
00:41:41,893 --> 00:41:44,487
¡­for your kindness
and your sensitivity

397
00:41:44,696 --> 00:41:47,426
Please, go on now,
and let us take care of her

398
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,692
Go on, now

399
00:41:53,004 --> 00:41:54,972
Thank you

400
00:41:58,109 --> 00:41:59,406
Thank you

401
00:42:01,112 --> 00:42:02,443
Okay, good

402
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:15,453
Yeah, that's right.  Elk River.
Stand by for transmission

403
00:42:19,597 --> 00:42:20,564
Ray

404
00:42:33,078 --> 00:42:35,808
Doctor, Lamar.
Let's take a look at her

405
00:42:52,964 --> 00:42:54,022
Jesus¡­.

406
00:43:01,439 --> 00:43:02,497
Okay, Starling

407
00:43:25,163 --> 00:43:29,998
Star£­shaped contact entrance
wound over the sternum

408
00:43:31,936 --> 00:43:33,801
A muzzle stamp at the top

409
00:43:34,005 --> 00:43:37,099
-Wrongful death.
-Wrongful death

410
00:43:37,342 --> 00:43:40,641
She'll have to go to the state
pathologist's at Claxton

411
00:43:40,845 --> 00:43:42,938
Well, I better get back
to that service

412
00:43:43,148 --> 00:43:44,479
Lamar will help you

413
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,343
Lord Almighty

414
00:43:51,222 --> 00:43:53,315
What else do you see, Starling?

415
00:43:54,492 --> 00:43:57,928
Well, she's not local

416
00:43:58,129 --> 00:44:00,962
Her ears are pierced three times
and there's¡­

417
00:44:02,467 --> 00:44:05,402
¡­glitter nail polish.
It looks like town to me

418
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:14,640
Two of her fingernails
are broken off¡­

419
00:44:14,845 --> 00:44:17,143
¡­and there's dirt or grit
under them

420
00:44:17,347 --> 00:44:20,407
It looks like she's tried to claw her
way through something

421
00:44:20,917 --> 00:44:23,647
Ray, get pictures of her teeth.
We'll fax them to Missing Persons

422
00:44:23,854 --> 00:44:25,082
Right

423
00:44:34,731 --> 00:44:36,062
Let's do another

424
00:44:45,242 --> 00:44:46,834
She's got something in her throat

425
00:44:48,211 --> 00:44:50,304
When a body comes out
of the water¡­

426
00:44:50,514 --> 00:44:53,176
¡­lots of times there's
leaves and things in the mouth

427
00:45:24,581 --> 00:45:25,775
What is that?

428
00:45:25,982 --> 00:45:27,574
Some kind of seedpod?

429
00:45:27,784 --> 00:45:30,651
No, sir.  That's a bug cocoon

430
00:45:31,288 --> 00:45:33,848
There's no way that could get
way down in there

431
00:45:34,057 --> 00:45:36,787
Not unless somebody
shoved it in there

432
00:45:39,196 --> 00:45:41,391
She'll be easier to print
when we turn her

433
00:45:41,598 --> 00:45:42,929
Lamar, give me a hand?

434
00:45:43,133 --> 00:45:44,623
Yes, sir, I will

435
00:45:48,972 --> 00:45:52,772
Oh, Jack.
What do you make of these?

436
00:45:52,976 --> 00:45:56,139
Different configuration than
the other victims.  Get close£­ups

437
00:45:56,346 --> 00:45:57,938
Victim's skin removed¡­

438
00:45:58,148 --> 00:46:01,242
¡­in two diamond£­shaped sections
above the buttocks

439
00:46:01,451 --> 00:46:04,648
Exit wound level with the second
or third thoracic vertebrae¡­

440
00:46:04,855 --> 00:46:07,722
¡­approximatelysix inches from
the right shoulder blade

441
00:46:07,924 --> 00:46:09,323
Starling¡­

442
00:46:10,427 --> 00:46:13,919
¡­when I told that sheriff we
shouldn't talk in front of a woman¡­

443
00:46:14,131 --> 00:46:15,723
¡­that burned you, didn't it?

444
00:46:15,932 --> 00:46:19,390
It was just smoke, Starling.
I had to get rid of him

445
00:46:19,603 --> 00:46:21,400
It matters, Mr. Crawford

446
00:46:21,605 --> 00:46:23,732
Cops look at you to see how to act

447
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,407
It matters

448
00:46:25,642 --> 00:46:26,939
Point taken

449
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:35,146
Ligature marks found around wrists¡­

450
00:46:35,352 --> 00:46:37,013
¡­not around the ankles

451
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:40,053
This would indicate that
the skinning was postmortem

452
00:47:03,914 --> 00:47:04,972
Time, Pilch.  My move

453
00:47:05,182 --> 00:47:10,085
£­No fair£¡  You lured him with produce.
£­Tough noogies.  It's still my turn

454
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,488
Nice and slow, baby

455
00:47:12,889 --> 00:47:16,188
If the beetle moves one of your men,
does that still count?

456
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:19,989
Of course it counts.  How do you play?

457
00:47:21,164 --> 00:47:23,792
Agent Starling?

458
00:47:24,234 --> 00:47:25,929
Where the heck did this come from?

459
00:47:26,303 --> 00:47:27,895
It's practically mush

460
00:47:28,104 --> 00:47:32,336
It was found in a murder victim.
The body was in the Elk River

461
00:47:32,542 --> 00:47:34,009
It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?

462
00:47:34,211 --> 00:47:35,542
I can't tell you any more

463
00:47:35,745 --> 00:47:36,939
We heard it on the radio

464
00:47:37,147 --> 00:47:40,446
You mean this is a clue
from a real murder case?  Cool£¡

465
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:43,278
Just ignore him.  He's not a Ph.D

466
00:47:43,687 --> 00:47:46,417
Sphingid Ceratomia, maybe£­£­

467
00:47:46,623 --> 00:47:49,251
Boy, he's a big sucker

468
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:51,357
Okay¡­

469
00:47:51,561 --> 00:47:53,529
¡­let's check morphology

470
00:48:02,405 --> 00:48:05,101
What do you do when you're not
detecting, Agent Starling?

471
00:48:06,409 --> 00:48:08,934
Try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher

472
00:48:09,479 --> 00:48:12,039
You ever go out for
cheeseburgers and beer?

473
00:48:13,283 --> 00:48:15,114
The amusing house wine?

474
00:48:15,318 --> 00:48:17,149
Are you hitting on me, doctor?

475
00:48:17,988 --> 00:48:19,853
£­Yes.
£­Gotcha£¡

476
00:48:20,056 --> 00:48:20,920
What do you got?

477
00:48:21,124 --> 00:48:25,993
Agent Starling,
meet Mr. Acherontia Styx

478
00:48:26,196 --> 00:48:27,288
Weird

479
00:48:27,497 --> 00:48:30,694
Better known to his friends
as the Death's£­head moth

480
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,060
Where does it come from?

481
00:48:32,269 --> 00:48:35,204
That's what's strange.
They only live in Asia

482
00:48:35,405 --> 00:48:38,033
They're specially raised from
imported eggs

483
00:48:38,241 --> 00:48:41,608
Somebody grew this guy.
Fed him honey and nightshade

484
00:48:41,811 --> 00:48:43,608
Kept him warm

485
00:48:44,381 --> 00:48:46,178
Somebody loved him

486
00:49:20,283 --> 00:49:22,114
Where are you?£¡

487
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:25,619
Let me out of here£¡

488
00:49:31,695 --> 00:49:32,889
Hey£¡

489
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:36,530
Please help me£¡

490
00:49:39,269 --> 00:49:41,396
Help me, please£¡

491
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:44,129
Why won't you answer me?£¡  Please£¡

492
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:50,341
-Good morning.  I'm Donna Ferucchi.
-I'm Gene Cassel with sports

493
00:49:50,547 --> 00:49:53,539
And I'm Tim Langhorn.
Ourtop story this morning:

494
00:49:53,883 --> 00:49:58,149
Catherine Martin, the 25-year-old
daughter of Senator Ruth Martin¡­

495
00:49:58,355 --> 00:49:59,686
¡­listed as a missing person¡­

496
00:49:59,889 --> 00:50:04,383
¡­is believed to have been kidnapped
by the killer known as ¡°Buffalo Bill.¡±

497
00:50:04,594 --> 00:50:08,030
Memphis police say the missing girl's
blouse has been identified¡­

498
00:50:08,231 --> 00:50:12,793
¡­sliced up the back, in what has
become a kind of grim calling card

499
00:50:13,002 --> 00:50:16,938
Young Catherine is the only daughter
of U.S. Senator Ruth Martin¡­

500
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,165
¡­the Republican senator
from Tennessee

501
00:50:19,376 --> 00:50:23,005
And while her kidnapping is not
considered politically motivated¡­

502
00:50:23,213 --> 00:50:26,148
¡­ithas stirred the government
to its highest levels

503
00:50:26,349 --> 00:50:29,147
Reached for comment on the ski
slopes of Vermont¡­

504
00:50:29,352 --> 00:50:32,913
¡­the president himself said to be,
and I quote, ¡°intensely concerned.¡±

505
00:50:33,123 --> 00:50:37,719
just moments ago, Senator Martin
taped this dramatic personal plea:

506
00:50:37,927 --> 00:50:41,727
I'm speaking, now, to the person
holding my daughter

507
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:46,268
Catherine is very gentle and kind

508
00:50:46,703 --> 00:50:49,001
Talk to her and you'll see

509
00:50:50,373 --> 00:50:54,241
You have the power.
You are in charge

510
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,281
I know you can feel love
and compassion

511
00:51:01,584 --> 00:51:05,350
You have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world¡­

512
00:51:05,555 --> 00:51:09,013
¡­that you can be merciful,
as well as strong

513
00:51:09,225 --> 00:51:11,989
That you're big enough
to treat Catherine better¡­

514
00:51:12,195 --> 00:51:14,356
¡­than the world has treated you

515
00:51:14,564 --> 00:51:16,533
You have that power

516
00:51:16,533 --> 00:51:21,027
Please.  My daughter is Catherine

517
00:51:21,238 --> 00:51:23,297
Boy, that's smart

518
00:51:23,507 --> 00:51:24,974
Jesus, that's really smart

519
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:27,176
She keeps repeating the name

520
00:51:27,377 --> 00:51:31,939
If he sees Catherine as a person, not
an object, it's harder to tear her up

521
00:51:32,149 --> 00:51:35,880
Please, release my little girl

522
00:51:36,153 --> 00:51:39,714
What you're doing, Ms. Starling,
is coming into my hospital¡­

523
00:51:39,923 --> 00:51:43,484
¡­and refusing to share information
with me for the third time

524
00:51:43,794 --> 00:51:48,288
Sir, I told you this is just
a routine follow£­up on the Raspail£­£­

525
00:51:48,498 --> 00:51:50,591
He is my patient.  I have rights

526
00:51:50,801 --> 00:51:51,631
I understand that

527
00:51:51,835 --> 00:51:56,329
Look, I am not just some turnkey,
Miss Starling

528
00:51:57,407 --> 00:51:59,671
This is the number for
the U.S. Attorney

529
00:51:59,876 --> 00:52:04,176
Please, either discuss it with him
or let me do my job, you understand?

530
00:52:09,686 --> 00:52:12,849
If your profile helps us catch
Buffalo Bill¡­

531
00:52:13,056 --> 00:52:15,684
¡­in time to save Catherine Martin¡­

532
00:52:15,892 --> 00:52:19,384
¡­the senator promises you
a transfer to the VA Hospital¡­

533
00:52:19,596 --> 00:52:23,032
¡­at Oneida Park, New York,
with a view of the woods nearby

534
00:52:23,233 --> 00:52:25,963
Maximum security still applies,
of course

535
00:52:26,369 --> 00:52:28,929
You'd have reasonable access to books

536
00:52:29,806 --> 00:52:30,898
Best of all, though¡­

537
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:36,135
¡­one week of the year, you get
to leave the hospital¡­

538
00:52:36,346 --> 00:52:38,678
¡­and go here£º

539
00:52:41,251 --> 00:52:43,185
Plum Island

540
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,317
Every day of that week,
you may walk on the beach

541
00:52:47,524 --> 00:52:50,721
You may swim in the ocean
for up to one hour¡­

542
00:52:50,927 --> 00:52:53,555
¡­under SWAT team surveillance,
of course

543
00:52:54,731 --> 00:52:55,891
And there you have it

544
00:52:58,668 --> 00:53:02,900
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file

545
00:53:03,874 --> 00:53:06,308
A copy of the senator's offer

546
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:09,775
This offer is non£­negotiable
and final

547
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,005
Catherine Martin dies,
you get nothing

548
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:27,956
Plum Island Animal Disease
Research Center

549
00:53:29,666 --> 00:53:31,190
Sounds charming

550
00:53:32,002 --> 00:53:35,631
That's only part of the island.
There's a very nice beach

551
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,069
Terns nest there.
There's beautiful£­£­

552
00:53:38,275 --> 00:53:40,402
Terns?

553
00:53:41,378 --> 00:53:44,438
If I help you, Clarice, it will be
¡°turns¡± with us too

554
00:53:44,648 --> 00:53:47,742
Quid pro quo.  I tell you things,
you tell me things

555
00:53:47,951 --> 00:53:50,613
Not about this case, though.
About yourself

556
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:53,789
Quid pro quo.  Yes or no?

557
00:53:56,326 --> 00:53:59,818
Yes or no, Clarice?  Poor little
Catherine is waiting

558
00:54:01,031 --> 00:54:02,430
Go, doctor

559
00:54:03,633 --> 00:54:06,227
What is your worst memory
of childhood?

560
00:54:08,204 --> 00:54:09,865
The death of my father

561
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,800
Tell me about it.
And don't lie, or I'll know

562
00:54:14,878 --> 00:54:17,005
He was a town marshal¡­

563
00:54:18,315 --> 00:54:23,582
¡­and one night he surprised two
burglars coming out of a drugstore

564
00:54:25,355 --> 00:54:26,788
They shot him

565
00:54:27,424 --> 00:54:29,619
Was he killed outright?

566
00:54:29,826 --> 00:54:34,422
No, he was very strong.
He lasted more than a month

567
00:54:35,098 --> 00:54:37,566
My mother died when I was
very young, so¡­

568
00:54:39,636 --> 00:54:42,730
¡­my father had become
the whole world to me¡­

569
00:54:42,939 --> 00:54:46,306
¡­and when he left me, I had
nothing.  I was 10 years old

570
00:54:47,043 --> 00:54:49,705
You're very frank, Clarice

571
00:54:50,046 --> 00:54:54,779
I think it would be quite something
to know you in private life

572
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,551
Quid pro quo, doctor

573
00:54:59,623 --> 00:55:04,151
So tell me about Miss West Virginia.
Was she a large girl?

574
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:07,760
Yes

575
00:55:07,964 --> 00:55:10,364
Big through the hips, roomy?

576
00:55:10,567 --> 00:55:11,864
They all were

577
00:55:12,602 --> 00:55:13,762
What else?

578
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:17,770
She had an object deliberately
inserted into her throat

579
00:55:17,974 --> 00:55:22,502
Now, that hasn't been made public yet.
We don't know what it means

580
00:55:22,712 --> 00:55:24,339
Was it a butterfly?

581
00:55:25,749 --> 00:55:28,377
Yes.  A moth

582
00:55:29,019 --> 00:55:33,718
Just like the one we found in
Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago

583
00:55:34,691 --> 00:55:36,522
Why does he place them there,
doctor?

584
00:55:37,627 --> 00:55:41,154
The significance of the moth
is change

585
00:55:41,364 --> 00:55:45,266
Caterpillar into chrysalis, or pupa¡­

586
00:55:45,468 --> 00:55:48,130
¡­and from thence into beauty

587
00:55:48,338 --> 00:55:51,273
Our Billy wants to change too

588
00:55:52,042 --> 00:55:55,170
There's no correlation between
transsexualism and violence

589
00:55:55,378 --> 00:55:58,176
£­Transsexuals are very passive.
£­Clever girl

590
00:55:58,848 --> 00:56:02,113
You're so close to the way you're
gonna catch him.  Do you realize that?

591
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:04,286
No.  Tell me why

592
00:56:05,088 --> 00:56:08,854
After your father's murder you were
orphaned.  What happened next?

593
00:56:12,762 --> 00:56:16,926
I don't imagine the answer is on
those second£­rate shoes, Clarice

594
00:56:17,133 --> 00:56:21,035
I went to live with my mother's cousin
and her husband in Montana

595
00:56:21,237 --> 00:56:22,534
They had a ranch

596
00:56:23,173 --> 00:56:24,538
Was it a cattle ranch?

597
00:56:24,941 --> 00:56:26,636
Sheep and horses

598
00:56:27,143 --> 00:56:28,440
How long did you live there?

599
00:56:29,646 --> 00:56:30,578
Two months

600
00:56:31,114 --> 00:56:32,206
Why so briefly?

601
00:56:32,816 --> 00:56:33,874
I ran away

602
00:56:34,384 --> 00:56:38,252
Why, Clarice?  Did the rancher
make you perform fellatio?

603
00:56:38,455 --> 00:56:40,423
Did he sodomize you?

604
00:56:41,057 --> 00:56:44,652
No.  He was a very decent man

605
00:56:45,929 --> 00:56:48,591
Quid pro quo, doctor

606
00:56:49,866 --> 00:56:52,232
Billy is not a real transsexual

607
00:56:52,435 --> 00:56:54,335
But he thinks he is.
He tries to be

608
00:56:54,537 --> 00:56:57,404
He's tried to be a lot of
things, I expect

609
00:56:57,607 --> 00:57:01,600
You said I was very close to the way
we'd catch him.  What did you mean?

610
00:57:01,811 --> 00:57:04,507
There are three major centers for
transsexual surgery£º

611
00:57:04,714 --> 00:57:08,810
Johns Hopkins, the University of
Minnesota, and Columbus Medical Center

612
00:57:09,018 --> 00:57:12,317
I wouldn't be surprised if Billy
applied for sex reassignment¡­

613
00:57:12,522 --> 00:57:16,288
¡­at one or all of them,
and been rejected

614
00:57:16,493 --> 00:57:18,256
On what basis would they reject him?

615
00:57:19,295 --> 00:57:23,789
Look for severe childhood
disturbances associated with violence

616
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,901
Our Billy wasn'tborn
a criminal, Clarice¡­

617
00:57:27,103 --> 00:57:31,096
¡­he was made one through
years of systematic abuse

618
00:57:31,307 --> 00:57:34,743
Billy hates his own identity,
you see¡­

619
00:57:34,944 --> 00:57:37,708
¡­and he thinks that makes him
a transsexual¡­

620
00:57:37,914 --> 00:57:42,044
¡­but his pathologyis
a thousand times more savage¡­

621
00:57:42,252 --> 00:57:44,049
¡­and more terrifying

622
00:57:47,289 --> 00:57:51,555
It rubs the lotion on its skin.
It does this whenever it's told

623
00:57:52,061 --> 00:57:53,824
Mister, my family will pay cash

624
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:57,158
Whatever ransom you're asking for,
they'll pay it

625
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:02,837
It rubs the lotion on its skin
or else it gets the hose again

626
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,908
Yes, she will, Precious.
She'll get the hose

627
00:58:07,977 --> 00:58:10,741
Okay, okay, okay

628
00:58:11,781 --> 00:58:13,612
Okay, I'll do it

629
00:58:13,816 --> 00:58:15,283
Okay

630
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:21,788
Mister, if you let me go,
I won't press charges.  I promise

631
00:58:22,792 --> 00:58:25,283
See, my mom is a real important woman

632
00:58:25,494 --> 00:58:27,485
I guess you already know that

633
00:58:27,697 --> 00:58:30,689
Now it places the lotion
in the basket

634
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:32,157
Please£¡

635
00:58:33,069 --> 00:58:35,128
Please, I want to go home

636
00:58:35,938 --> 00:58:39,032
I want to go home£¡
Please£¡  Please let me

637
00:58:39,241 --> 00:58:41,675
It places the lotion in the basket

638
00:58:42,545 --> 00:58:46,675
I want to see my mommy.
Please let me

639
00:58:47,416 --> 00:58:51,182
I want to see my mom again.
I want£­£­

640
00:58:51,387 --> 00:58:53,878
I want to see my mom

641
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:57,124
Put the fucking lotion in the basket£¡

642
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:36,987
You still think you're gonna walk
on some beach and see the birdies?

643
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:38,962
I don't think so

644
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:42,230
I called Senator Ruth Martin

645
00:59:42,438 --> 00:59:45,202
She never heard of any deal with you

646
00:59:46,008 --> 00:59:48,602
They scammed you, Hannibal

647
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:51,603
Stand outside

648
00:59:52,982 --> 00:59:54,574
And shut the door

649
00:59:54,884 --> 00:59:56,181
Barney

650
01:00:02,291 --> 01:00:06,557
There never was a deal with
Senator Martin, but there is now

651
01:00:06,762 --> 01:00:07,990
I designed it

652
01:00:08,197 --> 01:00:11,963
Of course, I worked in a few
conditions for my own benefit as well

653
01:00:12,168 --> 01:00:15,228
Identify Buffalo Bill by name¡­

654
01:00:15,437 --> 01:00:17,496
¡­and if the girl is found in time¡­

655
01:00:17,706 --> 01:00:21,972
¡­you'll be transferred to Brushy
Mountain State Prison in Tennessee

656
01:00:23,045 --> 01:00:24,910
Answer me, Hannibal

657
01:00:26,882 --> 01:00:28,474
You answer me now¡­

658
01:00:28,684 --> 01:00:31,551
¡­or, by God,
you'll never leave this cell

659
01:00:33,522 --> 01:00:35,752
Who is Buffalo Bill?

660
01:00:36,625 --> 01:00:38,786
His first name is Louis

661
01:00:39,228 --> 01:00:42,789
I'll tell the rest to the Senator
herself, but only in Tennessee

662
01:00:42,998 --> 01:00:45,466
And I have a few conditions of my own

663
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:50,163
Clean him up and get him ready to go

664
01:00:51,207 --> 01:00:54,404
jack, Hannibal Lecter
is being transferred to Memphis

665
01:00:54,643 --> 01:00:55,871
Transferred?

666
01:00:56,078 --> 01:01:00,572
Did you have a trainee make a phony
offer to Lecter in the senator's name?

667
01:01:00,783 --> 01:01:02,614
I rolled the dice.  I had to

668
01:01:02,818 --> 01:01:04,843
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack

669
01:01:05,054 --> 01:01:06,988
Paul Krendler's here from Justice

670
01:01:07,189 --> 01:01:10,022
She's asking him
to take over in Memphis

671
01:01:34,617 --> 01:01:36,482
Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter

672
01:01:36,685 --> 01:01:39,313
I'm Lieutenant Boyle.
This is Sergeant Patrick

673
01:01:39,521 --> 01:01:41,614
We'll treat you as good
as you treat us

674
01:01:41,824 --> 01:01:44,918
You be a gentleman,
you'll get three hots and a cot

675
01:01:45,961 --> 01:01:49,829
Sir, if you sign right here,
we'll have us a legal transfer

676
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:56,865
Here, sir, use mine

677
01:02:44,053 --> 01:02:45,042
Senator Martin¡­

678
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:48,515
¡­Dr. Hannibal Lecter

679
01:02:53,262 --> 01:02:54,854
Dr. Lecter¡­

680
01:02:55,331 --> 01:02:58,789
¡­I've brought an affidavit
guaranteeing your new rights

681
01:02:59,068 --> 01:03:01,559
You'll want to read it before I sign

682
01:03:05,207 --> 01:03:09,439
I won't waste your time or Catherine's
time bargaining for petty privileges

683
01:03:09,645 --> 01:03:13,547
Clarice Starling and Jack Crawford
have wasted too much time already

684
01:03:14,049 --> 01:03:17,075
I only pray they haven't doomed
the poor girl

685
01:03:18,153 --> 01:03:21,418
Let me help you now.
I will trust you when it is all over

686
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:23,915
You have my word.  Paul

687
01:03:26,662 --> 01:03:29,130
Buffalo Bill's real name
is Louis Friend

688
01:03:30,466 --> 01:03:34,425
I met him just once.  He was referred
to me in April or May, 1980¡­

689
01:03:34,636 --> 01:03:37,298
¡­by my patient Benjamin Raspail

690
01:03:37,506 --> 01:03:39,440
They were lovers, you see

691
01:03:39,808 --> 01:03:43,767
But Raspail had become
very frightened

692
01:03:43,979 --> 01:03:47,415
Apparently, Louis had
murdered a transient¡­

693
01:03:47,616 --> 01:03:49,352
¡­and done things with the skin

694
01:03:49,352 --> 01:03:51,183
¡­and done things with the skin

695
01:03:52,088 --> 01:03:54,579
We need his address
and a physical description

696
01:03:55,891 --> 01:03:57,722
Tell me, senator

697
01:03:58,194 --> 01:04:00,628
Did you nurse Catherine yourself?

698
01:04:01,063 --> 01:04:03,691
-What?
£­Did you breast£­feed her?

699
01:04:03,899 --> 01:04:06,265
£­Now, wait a minute£¡
£­Yes.  I did

700
01:04:06,569 --> 01:04:08,662
Toughened your nipples, didn't it?

701
01:04:08,871 --> 01:04:09,860
You son of a bitch£¡

702
01:04:10,373 --> 01:04:14,173
Amputate a man's leg,
and he can still feel it tickling

703
01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:17,709
Tell me, Mom, when your
little girl is on the slab¡­

704
01:04:17,913 --> 01:04:19,380
¡­where will it tickle you?

705
01:04:20,316 --> 01:04:23,649
Take this thing back to Baltimore

706
01:04:24,653 --> 01:04:27,622
Five£­foot£­ten, strongly built,
about 180 pounds

707
01:04:27,823 --> 01:04:30,383
Hair, blond.  Eyes, pale blue

708
01:04:30,593 --> 01:04:31,821
He'd be about 35 now

709
01:04:32,027 --> 01:04:34,928
He said he lived in Philadelphia
but may have lied

710
01:04:35,131 --> 01:04:36,860
That's all I can remember, Mom

711
01:04:37,066 --> 01:04:39,728
But if I think of any more,
I will let you know

712
01:04:42,204 --> 01:04:44,638
Oh, and senator, just one more thing£º

713
01:04:47,009 --> 01:04:48,806
Love your suit

714
01:04:50,946 --> 01:04:53,915
In a meeting earlier today
with Senator Ruth Martin¡­

715
01:04:54,116 --> 01:04:58,348
¡­Dr. Lecter agreed to help in the
investigation to find Buffalo Bill

716
01:05:00,756 --> 01:05:02,724
£­How do you fit in?
£­My unique insight¡­

717
01:05:02,925 --> 01:05:04,859
¡­into Lecter made the breakthrough

718
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:06,118
Buffalo Bill's name?

719
01:05:06,328 --> 01:05:10,094
His name is now a matter of record
with the proper authorities

720
01:05:10,299 --> 01:05:12,767
£­Can you give us£­£­?
£­I'm Dr. Frederick Chilton

721
01:05:12,968 --> 01:05:14,526
£­Spell it?
£­That's C£­H£­£­

722
01:05:16,205 --> 01:05:18,196
Are you with Dr. Chilton's group?

723
01:05:18,407 --> 01:05:20,898
Well, I just saw him outside, sir

724
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:24,375
Access to Lecter is limited.
We've received death threats

725
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:26,172
I understand, sir

726
01:05:32,288 --> 01:05:33,915
Log in and check your weapon

727
01:05:35,357 --> 01:05:37,587
I can't take all the credit myself

728
01:05:37,793 --> 01:05:40,091
Senator Martin,
Justice Department, FBI¡­

729
01:05:40,296 --> 01:05:43,732
¡­folks at the Baltimore State
Hospital.  Now for the hard part£º

730
01:05:43,933 --> 01:05:45,730
Apprehending the suspect

731
01:05:46,235 --> 01:05:48,294
Excuse me, I have to catch a flight

732
01:05:52,541 --> 01:05:54,736
Command desk, Officer Jacobs

733
01:06:03,686 --> 01:06:06,746
£­Is it true what they're saying?
£­Huh?

734
01:06:07,756 --> 01:06:09,781
He's some kind of vampire?

735
01:06:12,061 --> 01:06:14,256
They don't have a name for what he is

736
01:06:15,364 --> 01:06:17,059
You do know the rules, ma'am?

737
01:06:17,766 --> 01:06:20,098
Yes, I've questioned him before

738
01:06:23,606 --> 01:06:24,595
Go ahead

739
01:07:02,111 --> 01:07:04,079
Good evening, Clarice

740
01:07:05,648 --> 01:07:08,344
I thought you might like
your drawings back

741
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:13,011
Just until you get your view

742
01:07:13,756 --> 01:07:15,986
How very thoughtful

743
01:07:16,926 --> 01:07:19,724
Or did Jack Crawford
send you for one last wheedle¡­

744
01:07:19,929 --> 01:07:22,159
¡­before you're both
booted off the case?

745
01:07:22,665 --> 01:07:24,860
No.  I came because I wanted to

746
01:07:29,538 --> 01:07:31,972
People will say we're in love

747
01:07:36,111 --> 01:07:38,602
Anthrax Island

748
01:07:38,814 --> 01:07:41,783
That was an especially
nice touch, Clarice

749
01:07:41,984 --> 01:07:42,973
Yours?

750
01:07:43,686 --> 01:07:44,710
Yes

751
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,478
Yeah

752
01:07:47,122 --> 01:07:48,919
That was good

753
01:07:49,124 --> 01:07:51,058
Pity about poor Catherine, though

754
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:53,285
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock

755
01:07:53,495 --> 01:07:56,293
Your anagrams are showing, doctor

756
01:07:57,132 --> 01:07:58,656
Louis Friend?

757
01:07:59,368 --> 01:08:02,565
Iron sulfide,
also known as fool's gold

758
01:08:03,005 --> 01:08:06,907
Oh, Clarice, your problem is, you
need to get more fun out of life

759
01:08:07,376 --> 01:08:10,345
You were telling me the truth
back in Baltimore, sir

760
01:08:10,546 --> 01:08:12,013
Please continue now

761
01:08:12,615 --> 01:08:15,106
Well, I've read the case files.
Have you?

762
01:08:15,484 --> 01:08:18,544
Everything you need to find him
is there in those pages

763
01:08:18,754 --> 01:08:21,655
£­Then tell me how.
£­First principles, Clarice

764
01:08:21,857 --> 01:08:24,951
Simplicity.  Read Marcus Aurelius

765
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:28,618
Of each particular thing, ask£º
What is it in itself?

766
01:08:28,831 --> 01:08:30,628
What is its nature?

767
01:08:31,066 --> 01:08:34,968
What does he do, this man you seek?

768
01:08:36,472 --> 01:08:37,700
He kills women

769
01:08:37,906 --> 01:08:40,875
No.  That is incidental

770
01:08:41,877 --> 01:08:46,974
What is the principle thing he does?
What needs does he serve by killing?

771
01:08:47,516 --> 01:08:48,744
Anger¡­

772
01:08:50,386 --> 01:08:54,413
¡­social acceptance
and sexual frustration£­£­

773
01:08:54,623 --> 01:08:55,612
No£¡

774
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:58,216
He covets

775
01:08:59,094 --> 01:09:00,652
That is his nature

776
01:09:01,163 --> 01:09:03,495
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?

777
01:09:04,266 --> 01:09:06,894
Do we seek out things to covet?

778
01:09:07,503 --> 01:09:09,403
Make an effort to answer now

779
01:09:09,605 --> 01:09:12,073
No, we just£­£­

780
01:09:12,274 --> 01:09:15,607
No, we begin by coveting
what we see every day

781
01:09:15,811 --> 01:09:19,110
Don't you feel eyes moving
over your body, Clarice?

782
01:09:19,848 --> 01:09:23,249
And don't your eyes seek out
the things you want?

783
01:09:23,952 --> 01:09:26,284
All right, yes.
Now, please tell me how

784
01:09:26,488 --> 01:09:27,955
No

785
01:09:28,691 --> 01:09:30,659
It is your turn to tell me, Clarice

786
01:09:30,859 --> 01:09:33,327
You don't have any more
vacations to sell

787
01:09:33,996 --> 01:09:36,487
Why did you leave that ranch?

788
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:40,826
Doctor, we don't have any more time
for any of this now

789
01:09:41,036 --> 01:09:43,561
But we don't reckon time
the same way, do we?

790
01:09:43,772 --> 01:09:45,637
This is all the time you'll have

791
01:09:45,841 --> 01:09:48,139
Later.  Please listen.
We've only got five£­£­

792
01:09:48,343 --> 01:09:53,816
No£¡  I will listen now

793
01:09:53,816 --> 01:09:56,785
Your father's murder orphaned you
when you were 10

794
01:09:56,985 --> 01:10:01,820
You went to live with cousins on a
sheep and horse ranch in Montana.  And?

795
01:10:04,093 --> 01:10:06,288
And one morning I just ran away

796
01:10:07,062 --> 01:10:10,554
Not ¡°just,¡± Clarice.
What set you off?

797
01:10:10,766 --> 01:10:12,358
You started at what time?

798
01:10:13,102 --> 01:10:14,399
Early, still dark

799
01:10:14,603 --> 01:10:17,197
Then something woke you.
Was it a dream?

800
01:10:17,406 --> 01:10:18,498
What was it?

801
01:10:20,042 --> 01:10:21,805
I heard a strange noise

802
01:10:23,045 --> 01:10:24,410
What was it?

803
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:26,242
It was¡­

804
01:10:27,449 --> 01:10:28,939
¡­screaming

805
01:10:30,519 --> 01:10:33,215
Some kind of screaming,
like a child's voice

806
01:10:33,789 --> 01:10:35,256
What did you do?

807
01:10:35,791 --> 01:10:37,122
I went¡­

808
01:10:37,326 --> 01:10:40,022
¡­downstairs.  Outside

809
01:10:42,164 --> 01:10:44,758
I crept up into the barn

810
01:10:44,967 --> 01:10:48,164
I was so scared to look inside,
but I had to

811
01:10:49,304 --> 01:10:52,603
And what did you see, Clarice?
What did you see?

812
01:10:54,042 --> 01:10:55,339
Lambs

813
01:10:56,545 --> 01:10:58,206
They were screaming

814
01:10:58,781 --> 01:11:01,545
They were slaughtering
the spring lambs?

815
01:11:02,084 --> 01:11:03,813
And they were screaming

816
01:11:05,154 --> 01:11:06,849
And you ran away?

817
01:11:07,055 --> 01:11:10,889
No.  First I tried to free them

818
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,994
I opened the gate to their pen

819
01:11:14,196 --> 01:11:17,632
They just stood there, confused.
They wouldn't run

820
01:11:17,833 --> 01:11:20,324
But you could and you did, didn't you?

821
01:11:21,136 --> 01:11:24,537
Yes.  I took one lamb
and I ran away as fast as I could

822
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:26,537
Where were you going, Clarice?

823
01:11:26,742 --> 01:11:29,734
I don't know.  I didn't have
any food, any water¡­

824
01:11:29,945 --> 01:11:32,573
¡­and it was very cold.
It was very cold

825
01:11:34,783 --> 01:11:35,909
I thought¡­.

826
01:11:36,819 --> 01:11:39,379
I thought if I could save just one¡­

827
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:42,982
¡­but he was so heavy

828
01:11:44,092 --> 01:11:45,582
He was so heavy

829
01:11:50,899 --> 01:11:54,835
I didn't get more than a few miles
when the sheriff's car picked me up

830
01:11:58,006 --> 01:12:02,204
The rancher was so angry he sent me
to a Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman

831
01:12:03,045 --> 01:12:05,036
I never saw the ranch again

832
01:12:05,747 --> 01:12:08,477
What became of your lamb, Clarice?

833
01:12:10,419 --> 01:12:11,716
They killed him

834
01:12:12,087 --> 01:12:14,282
You still wake up sometimes,
don't you?

835
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:16,285
Wake up in the dark¡­

836
01:12:16,959 --> 01:12:19,792
¡­and hear the screaming
of the lambs?

837
01:12:20,395 --> 01:12:21,487
Yes

838
01:12:22,998 --> 01:12:25,796
And you think if you save
poor Catherine¡­

839
01:12:26,001 --> 01:12:29,562
¡­you can make them stop, don't you?
You think if Catherine lives¡­

840
01:12:29,771 --> 01:12:32,968
¡­you won't wake up
in the dark ever again¡­

841
01:12:33,175 --> 01:12:36,042
¡­to that awful screaming
of the lambs

842
01:12:37,212 --> 01:12:38,577
I don't know

843
01:12:39,314 --> 01:12:40,645
I don't know

844
01:12:42,351 --> 01:12:44,751
Thank you, Clarice

845
01:12:44,953 --> 01:12:46,511
Thank you

846
01:12:46,822 --> 01:12:48,813
Tell me his name, doctor

847
01:12:55,764 --> 01:12:58,028
Dr. Chilton, I presume

848
01:12:58,634 --> 01:13:00,192
I think you know each other

849
01:13:02,437 --> 01:13:03,961
Okay

850
01:13:04,606 --> 01:13:06,733
-We found her.
£­Let's go

851
01:13:06,942 --> 01:13:08,705
It's your turn, doctor

852
01:13:09,111 --> 01:13:10,772
£­Out£¡
£­Tell me his name

853
01:13:10,979 --> 01:13:13,812
Sorry, ma'am, I've got orders
to put you on a plane

854
01:13:14,016 --> 01:13:15,176
Come on, now

855
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:17,418
Brave Clarice

856
01:13:17,753 --> 01:13:21,314
You will let me know when those lambs
stop screaming, won't you?

857
01:13:21,523 --> 01:13:23,354
Tell me his name, doctor£¡

858
01:13:23,558 --> 01:13:24,855
Clarice£¡

859
01:13:26,228 --> 01:13:27,991
Your case file

860
01:13:29,665 --> 01:13:30,757
Hey£¡

861
01:13:32,935 --> 01:13:34,425
Goodbye, Clarice

862
01:14:40,569 --> 01:14:42,332
Ready when you are, doc

863
01:14:42,738 --> 01:14:44,831
Just another minute, please

864
01:14:53,682 --> 01:14:56,116
Son of a bitch demanded
a second dinner

865
01:14:56,318 --> 01:14:58,149
Lamb chops, extra rare

866
01:14:58,353 --> 01:15:02,949
Wonder what he wants for breakfast?
Some damn thing from the zoo?

867
01:15:24,513 --> 01:15:25,980
Good evening, gentlemen

868
01:15:26,448 --> 01:15:28,143
Okay, doc.  Grab some floor

869
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:30,409
Same drill as before, please

870
01:15:37,259 --> 01:15:39,557
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry

871
01:15:56,144 --> 01:15:57,270
Okay

872
01:16:04,119 --> 01:16:05,586
Hand me that, would you?

873
01:16:11,326 --> 01:16:12,486
Thanks

874
01:16:16,397 --> 01:16:18,388
Mind the drawings, please

875
01:16:21,636 --> 01:16:22,660
Thank you

876
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:49,822
Pembry, watch it, he's cuffed me£¡

877
01:16:56,471 --> 01:16:57,904
Jesus Christ£¡

878
01:18:16,684 --> 01:18:19,118
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry

879
01:18:28,563 --> 01:18:30,497
What is this shit?

880
01:18:32,967 --> 01:18:34,662
Did somebody go up on five?

881
01:18:34,869 --> 01:18:38,669
£­No, nobody went up.
£­Call Pembry.  Ask him to tell£­£­

882
01:18:41,576 --> 01:18:45,637
CP, shots fired on five.
Repeat, shots fired on five

883
01:18:45,847 --> 01:18:47,178
Sergeant Tate£¡

884
01:18:47,782 --> 01:18:49,409
Proceed.  Shots fired on five

885
01:18:49,984 --> 01:18:51,645
Holy shit£¡

886
01:18:51,853 --> 01:18:53,650
-What the hell?
£­Bitch£¡

887
01:18:54,022 --> 01:18:55,011
Shut up£¡

888
01:18:55,290 --> 01:18:56,450
Bobby, get the vest

889
01:18:56,658 --> 01:18:58,125
Right, sarge

890
01:18:58,459 --> 01:19:00,620
£­Brady, Howard, cover£­£­
£­Look£¡

891
01:19:03,464 --> 01:19:04,988
It stopped

892
01:19:06,267 --> 01:19:07,928
Seal off a 10£­block radius

893
01:19:08,136 --> 01:19:11,105
Get me the SWaT team
and an ambulance, double quick

894
01:19:11,306 --> 01:19:12,466
We're going up

895
01:19:41,469 --> 01:19:42,993
Pembry?£¡

896
01:19:44,439 --> 01:19:45,929
Boyle?£¡

897
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,285
Oh, God£¡

898
01:20:07,428 --> 01:20:08,486
Go

899
01:20:16,304 --> 01:20:17,703
£­Clear.
£­Clear

900
01:20:17,905 --> 01:20:19,304
Command post

901
01:20:19,741 --> 01:20:21,265
Two officers down

902
01:20:21,476 --> 01:20:22,966
£­Clear£¡
£­Clear£¡

903
01:20:23,411 --> 01:20:24,605
Lecter's gone, sarge

904
01:20:24,812 --> 01:20:26,609
Prisoner is missing

905
01:20:26,814 --> 01:20:28,281
Boyle's gun is gone

906
01:20:28,616 --> 01:20:31,084
Repeat.  Lecter is missing and armed

907
01:20:31,285 --> 01:20:33,082
He stripped the bed

908
01:20:33,521 --> 01:20:36,285
Might be making a rope.
Check all the windows

909
01:20:36,491 --> 01:20:38,789
Where the fuck is my ambulance?

910
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:40,750
He's alive

911
01:20:41,362 --> 01:20:43,626
Sergeant Tate£¡  He's alive£¡

912
01:20:43,998 --> 01:20:47,195
Get ahold of him and feel his hands.
Talk to him£¡

913
01:20:47,702 --> 01:20:48,726
What do I say?

914
01:20:48,936 --> 01:20:51,871
It's Jim Pembry.
Now talk to him, damn it£¡

915
01:20:52,774 --> 01:20:55,038
Lecter is missing and armed

916
01:20:55,243 --> 01:20:59,077
£­Pembry.  Pembry, can you hear me?
£­He took Boyle's gun

917
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:02,306
Pembry got off one round.
There's a chance Lecter's hit

918
01:21:02,517 --> 01:21:04,451
Keep breathing in and out

919
01:21:04,652 --> 01:21:08,213
You're doing a good job.
You look real good there

920
01:21:08,856 --> 01:21:11,757
Yeah, you look£­£­  Look real good

921
01:21:28,743 --> 01:21:29,903
£­You ready?
£­Let's go£¡

922
01:21:30,111 --> 01:21:32,102
£­Let's do it.
£­Okay, let's go£¡

923
01:21:43,024 --> 01:21:45,151
Looking good.  You're gonna make it

924
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:47,350
Everything's just fine

925
01:21:47,562 --> 01:21:49,792
£­I need that IV now£¡
£­Lactated Ringer's

926
01:21:49,997 --> 01:21:52,363
Can we get the strap?
Where's the oxygen?

927
01:21:52,567 --> 01:21:56,298
Doing good, buddy.  That's right.
Stay with me here

928
01:21:57,638 --> 01:22:00,402
We're losing him£¡
Downstairs, quickly£¡

929
01:22:00,741 --> 01:22:02,208
And up£¡

932
01:22:11,152 --> 01:22:12,710
CP to Tate

Roger, lieutenant.  Tate here

934
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:18,618
I'm on the elevator
bringing Pembry down

935
01:22:19,093 --> 01:22:21,061
He seems to be hanging on

936
01:22:21,762 --> 01:22:23,855
Top three floors secured

937
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:26,457
Main stairwell secured

938
01:22:27,435 --> 01:22:29,335
We think he's on two

939
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:44,778
Tate, you still with me?

940
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:48,854
We're pretty sure
he's somewhere on two, sir

941
01:22:49,056 --> 01:23:10,478
That's all for now.  Over

942
01:23:10,478 --> 01:23:13,038
He's on the roof of the elevator

943
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:17,081
Okay, guys

944
01:23:33,701 --> 01:23:34,690
I see him

945
01:23:35,169 --> 01:23:37,535
There's a gun by his hand.
He's not moving

946
01:23:38,372 --> 01:23:41,170
£­One warning.  We need him alive.
-Got it

947
01:23:42,276 --> 01:23:43,504
Lecter?

948
01:23:43,811 --> 01:23:45,745
Put your hands on your head

949
01:23:48,115 --> 01:23:49,582
One in the leg

950
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:02,185
No movement

951
01:24:03,397 --> 01:24:06,093
Johnny, hold your fire.
We're coming into the car

952
01:24:06,567 --> 01:24:08,194
We're opening the hatch

953
01:24:09,036 --> 01:24:10,025
Watch his hands

954
01:24:10,237 --> 01:24:13,172
If there's any fire,
it'll come from us.  Affirm

955
01:24:13,374 --> 01:24:14,432
Got it

956
01:24:40,568 --> 01:24:42,502
Memphis General, this is Unit 26

957
01:24:42,703 --> 01:24:45,263
We're inbound with
a 50£­year£­old male officer¡­

958
01:24:45,473 --> 01:24:47,600
¡­with severe facial lacerations

959
01:24:47,808 --> 01:24:50,936
He had grand mal seizure activity.
He's postdictal now

960
01:24:51,145 --> 01:24:53,306
-I copy.
-Vital signs are good

961
01:24:53,514 --> 01:24:55,175
£­Pressure is 130/90.
£­Ninety?

962
01:24:55,382 --> 01:24:57,543
Yeah, that's right, 90.  Pulse, 84

963
01:24:57,818 --> 01:25:00,116
We got him
on lactated Ringer's running¡­

964
01:25:00,321 --> 01:25:02,619
¡­and the patient
is on 10 liters of oxygen

965
01:25:03,757 --> 01:25:04,917
Watch it£¡

966
01:25:09,263 --> 01:25:12,664
The ambulance was found in
a parking garage at Memphis Airport

967
01:25:12,867 --> 01:25:14,334
The crew was dead

968
01:25:15,402 --> 01:25:17,029
He killed a tourist too

969
01:25:17,238 --> 01:25:19,103
Got his clothes, cash

970
01:25:19,507 --> 01:25:21,304
By now he could be anywhere

971
01:25:21,509 --> 01:25:23,500
£­He won't come after me.
£­Oh, really?

972
01:25:23,711 --> 01:25:24,837
He won't

973
01:25:25,312 --> 01:25:27,075
I can't explain it

974
01:25:27,281 --> 01:25:29,511
He would consider that rude

975
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,815
It's over.  She's dead

976
01:25:32,019 --> 01:25:33,646
It's not your fault

977
01:25:33,854 --> 01:25:38,484
Lecter said everything we need to
catch him with is here, only I can't£­£­

978
01:25:38,692 --> 01:25:40,489
Dr. Lecter said a lot of things

979
01:25:41,228 --> 01:25:42,456
He's here, Ardelia

980
01:26:12,092 --> 01:26:14,060
Is this Lecter's handwriting?

981
01:26:16,096 --> 01:26:20,465
Doesn't this random scattering
of sites seem desperately random?

982
01:26:20,668 --> 01:26:24,468
Like the elaboration of a bad liar?
Ta.  Hannibal Lecter

983
01:26:24,672 --> 01:26:27,664
¡°Desperately random.¡±
What does he mean?

984
01:26:27,875 --> 01:26:30,776
Not random at all, maybe.
Like there's a pattern here

985
01:26:31,879 --> 01:26:35,110
But there's no pattern
or the computers would've nailed it

986
01:26:35,316 --> 01:26:37,750
They're even found in random order

987
01:26:37,952 --> 01:26:41,786
Random because of the one girl.
The one he weighted down

988
01:26:42,223 --> 01:26:44,123
£­Fredrica Bimmel.
£­Right

989
01:26:44,325 --> 01:26:47,658
From Belvedere, Ohio

990
01:26:47,861 --> 01:26:51,422
The first girl taken,
third body found.  Why?

991
01:26:51,632 --> 01:26:53,759
She didn't drift.
He weighted her down

992
01:26:53,968 --> 01:26:57,301
What did Lecter say
about the ¡°first principles¡±?

993
01:26:57,504 --> 01:26:59,062
Simplicity

994
01:26:59,273 --> 01:27:02,538
What does this guy do?  He covets

995
01:27:02,743 --> 01:27:05,234
How do we first start to covet?

996
01:27:05,446 --> 01:27:07,141
We covet what we see

997
01:27:07,348 --> 01:27:08,975
Every day

998
01:27:10,985 --> 01:27:12,213
Hot damn, Clarice

999
01:27:12,686 --> 01:27:13,948
He knew her

1000
01:28:29,330 --> 01:28:30,729
Mr. Bimmel?

1001
01:28:30,931 --> 01:28:32,159
That's me

1002
01:28:32,499 --> 01:28:35,161
Hello, I'm Clarice Starling.
I'm with the FBI

1003
01:28:39,073 --> 01:28:42,338
I appreciate you letting me
take a look around, Mr. Bimmel

1004
01:28:42,810 --> 01:28:44,937
I don't know nothing new to tell you

1005
01:28:45,145 --> 01:28:48,080
Police been back here
so many times already

1006
01:28:48,749 --> 01:28:51,115
Fredrica went into Chicago
on the bus to see about a job

1007
01:28:53,387 --> 01:28:54,945
She left the interview okay

1008
01:28:54,988 --> 01:28:56,580
She never come home

1009
01:28:59,426 --> 01:29:01,587
Her bedroom's how she left it

1010
01:29:02,029 --> 01:29:03,018
Upstairs

1011
01:29:03,697 --> 01:29:05,187
Doorto the left

1012
01:31:50,197 --> 01:31:53,826
He's making himself a woman suit.
Out of real women!

1013
01:31:54,034 --> 01:31:55,092
And he can sew£¡

1014
01:31:55,302 --> 01:31:58,294
He's very skilled.
He's a tailor or a dressmaker or£­£­

1015
01:31:58,505 --> 01:32:00,268
-starling!
£­That's why they're big

1016
01:32:00,474 --> 01:32:02,704
He keeps them alive
so he can starve them¡­

1017
01:32:02,909 --> 01:32:04,342
¡­loosen their skin and£­£­

1018
01:32:04,544 --> 01:32:07,069
Starling!
We know who and where he is!

1019
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:08,770
We're on our way right now

1020
01:32:08,982 --> 01:32:11,883
-Where?
£­Calumet City, edge of Chicago

1021
01:32:12,085 --> 01:32:14,645
Be on the ground
in 45 minutes with HRT

1022
01:32:14,855 --> 01:32:17,050
That's great news, sir.  But how£­£­?

1023
01:32:17,257 --> 01:32:20,818
We fed the names johns Hopkins
came up with into Known Offenders

1024
01:32:21,027 --> 01:32:24,963
Subject's name is Jamie Gumb,
a.k.a. John Grant

1025
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:28,862
Lecter's description was accurate.
He just lied about the name

1026
01:32:29,069 --> 01:32:31,162
Customs had some paper on him

1027
01:32:31,371 --> 01:32:34,431
They stopped a carton
two years ago at LAX

1028
01:32:34,641 --> 01:32:36,700
Live caterpillars from Suriname

1029
01:32:36,910 --> 01:32:39,902
The addressee was a Jame Gumb

1030
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:43,381
Chicago is only 400 miles from here.
I'll be there in£­£­

1031
01:32:43,583 --> 01:32:45,278
No, there's not enough time

1032
01:32:45,485 --> 01:32:47,680
We want him for murder,
not kidnapping

1033
01:32:47,888 --> 01:32:50,152
Link him to Bimmel
before he's indicted

1034
01:32:50,357 --> 01:32:54,384
£­See what you can find in Belvedere.
£­Yes, sir.  You bet.  I'll do my best

1035
01:32:54,594 --> 01:32:55,925
Starling

1036
01:32:56,329 --> 01:32:59,924
We wouldn't have found him
without you.  Nobody will forget that

1037
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:02,192
Least of all me

1038
01:33:03,270 --> 01:33:04,430
Thank you, sir

1039
01:33:04,638 --> 01:33:06,970
Thank you very much, Mr. Crawford

1040
01:33:08,241 --> 01:33:09,674
Mr. Crawford?

1041
01:33:22,189 --> 01:33:24,487
Thanks for the scraps, asshole

1042
01:33:24,791 --> 01:33:26,725
I got a better idea

1043
01:33:48,081 --> 01:33:50,709
Okay, Precious.
Time for a little treat

1044
01:34:03,663 --> 01:34:05,153
Precious£¡

1045
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:09,263
Come on, girl£¡

1046
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:12,795
Come on, Precious.  Come on, Precious

1047
01:34:22,048 --> 01:34:23,777
Come on, Precious

1048
01:34:23,984 --> 01:34:26,851
I got a yummy, yummy snack for you

1049
01:34:27,053 --> 01:34:28,315
Come and get it£¡

1050
01:34:35,328 --> 01:34:36,761
Precious£¡

1051
01:34:37,564 --> 01:34:40,294
Are you up there, you little shit?

1052
01:34:40,834 --> 01:34:50,142
Come and get it, pretty girl

1053
01:34:50,142 --> 01:34:51,507
Precious£¡

1054
01:34:51,711 --> 01:34:53,872
Please come.  Come on

1055
01:35:01,687 --> 01:35:03,655
Come on, Precious

1056
01:35:15,534 --> 01:35:17,024
Would you fuck me?

1057
01:35:17,470 --> 01:35:20,439
Come on.  Take that bone.  Come on

1058
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:23,904
Come on.  Come on£¡  Come on£¡

1059
01:35:24,376 --> 01:35:25,570
I'd fuck me

1060
01:35:26,378 --> 01:35:27,367
Come on

1061
01:35:31,684 --> 01:35:36,280
I'd fuck me hard.
I'd fuck me so hard

1062
01:35:40,459 --> 01:35:41,721
No£¡

1063
01:36:42,721 --> 01:36:46,623
Is that a good job, FBI agent?
You get to travel around and stuff?

1064
01:36:46,826 --> 01:36:48,987
I mean, better places than this?

1065
01:36:50,796 --> 01:36:52,354
Sometimes you do

1066
01:36:53,232 --> 01:36:57,566
Freddie was so happy for me
when I got this job at the bank

1067
01:36:57,770 --> 01:37:01,706
Toaster give aways and Barry Manilow
on the speakers all day

1068
01:37:01,907 --> 01:37:04,467
She thought it was such hot shit

1069
01:37:04,877 --> 01:37:07,175
What did she know?  Big dummy

1070
01:37:07,379 --> 01:37:11,543
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention
a man named Jamie Gumb?

1071
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:13,411
Or a Jame Gumb?

1072
01:37:14,186 --> 01:37:16,450
£­How about John Grant?
£­No

1073
01:37:16,655 --> 01:37:18,987
Would she have had a friend
you didn't know?

1074
01:37:19,191 --> 01:37:21,751
No way.  If she had a guy,
I'd have known

1075
01:37:21,961 --> 01:37:23,519
Sewing was her life

1076
01:37:24,263 --> 01:37:25,821
Did you ever work together?

1077
01:37:26,031 --> 01:37:30,764
Me and Pam Malavesi used to help her
do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman

1078
01:37:31,303 --> 01:37:34,864
Can I get Mrs. Lippman's address?
I need to talk to her

1079
01:38:02,968 --> 01:38:04,731
So powerful

1080
01:38:04,937 --> 01:38:06,564
So beautiful

1081
01:38:11,677 --> 01:38:13,110
Precious?

1082
01:38:18,918 --> 01:38:19,907
Precious?

1083
01:38:20,119 --> 01:38:22,144
Down here, you sack of shit£¡

1084
01:38:30,829 --> 01:38:32,353
£­Put her in that bucket.
£­No£¡

1085
01:38:32,564 --> 01:38:35,431
You get me a telephone
and lower it down here, now£¡

1086
01:38:38,570 --> 01:38:42,529
Oh, poodlie£­poo.  Precious?
Darling, are you all right?

1087
01:38:42,741 --> 01:38:45,733
She's in a lot of pain, mister.
She needs a vet

1088
01:38:50,082 --> 01:38:52,710
She broke her leg on the way down.
She's licking£­£­

1089
01:38:52,918 --> 01:38:54,909
Hey£¡  Don't you hurt my dog£¡

1090
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:57,020
Don't you make me hurt your dog£¡

1091
01:38:57,222 --> 01:38:59,383
You don't know what pain is£¡

1092
01:39:04,797 --> 01:39:08,392
Get me that telephone
or I'll kill him£¡

1093
01:39:12,938 --> 01:39:17,170
£­Oh, fuck£¡
£­You better get me that telephone£¡

1094
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:19,469
I'm gonna do it, mister£¡£¡

1095
01:39:19,678 --> 01:39:23,739
I'm gonna snap her neck off,
I swear to God£¡

1096
01:39:24,216 --> 01:39:26,207
All right, mister.  I'm doing it£¡

1097
01:39:49,775 --> 01:39:52,005
Okay, I'm coming

1098
01:39:53,412 --> 01:39:54,777
We're going in

1099
01:39:59,651 --> 01:40:01,846
Good afternoon.  Sorry to bother you

1100
01:40:02,054 --> 01:40:04,352
I'm looking for Mrs. Lippman's family

1101
01:40:05,024 --> 01:40:07,117
FBI£¡  Everybody down£¡

1102
01:40:08,093 --> 01:40:10,027
Lippmans don't live here anymore

1103
01:40:10,229 --> 01:40:12,697
Excuse me, sir.
I need to speak with you

1104
01:40:13,899 --> 01:40:15,662
£­Clear£¡
£­Clear£¡

1105
01:40:16,468 --> 01:40:18,493
What's the problem, officer?

1106
01:40:18,704 --> 01:40:21,434
I'm investigating the death
of Fredrica Bimmel

1107
01:40:24,777 --> 01:40:29,047
There's no one here, Jack

1108
01:40:29,047 --> 01:40:30,515
Clarice

1109
01:40:30,515 --> 01:40:31,607
Your name is¡­?

1110
01:40:31,816 --> 01:40:32,942
Oh, Jack Gordon

1111
01:40:33,151 --> 01:40:35,016
Mr. Gordon.  Good

1112
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:38,451
Fredrica worked for Mrs. Lippman.
Did you know her?

1113
01:40:39,424 --> 01:40:41,085
No, uh£­uh

1114
01:40:41,659 --> 01:40:43,126
Oh, wait

1115
01:40:43,428 --> 01:40:45,623
Was she a great big fat person?

1116
01:40:46,531 --> 01:40:48,158
Yes, she was a big girl, sir

1117
01:40:48,366 --> 01:40:49,856
Yeah, I may have£­£­

1118
01:40:50,068 --> 01:40:52,559
No, I read about her in the newspaper

1119
01:40:54,406 --> 01:40:56,772
Mrs. Lippman had a son.
Maybe he could help

1120
01:40:56,975 --> 01:40:58,704
I got his card in here

1121
01:40:58,910 --> 01:41:00,138
You want to come in?

1122
01:41:00,345 --> 01:41:01,437
£­May I?
£­Yeah, sure

1123
01:41:01,646 --> 01:41:02,806
Thank you

1124
01:41:21,666 --> 01:41:23,725
Are you close to catching somebody?

1125
01:41:25,503 --> 01:41:26,492
Yes

1126
01:41:26,704 --> 01:41:27,898
We may be

1127
01:41:29,741 --> 01:41:30,935
Did you¡­

1128
01:41:31,876 --> 01:41:35,471
¡­take over this place after
Mrs. Lippman died, is that right?

1129
01:41:36,781 --> 01:41:41,115
Yeah, I bought this house
two years ago

1130
01:41:42,387 --> 01:41:45,720
Did she leave any records,
any business records¡­

1131
01:41:45,924 --> 01:41:49,758
¡­tax forms, lists of employees?

1132
01:41:50,395 --> 01:41:52,329
No, nothing like that at all

1133
01:41:54,699 --> 01:41:57,429
Say, has the FBI learned something?

1134
01:41:57,635 --> 01:42:01,036
The police around here don't seem
to have the first clue

1135
01:42:10,615 --> 01:42:15,314
Have you got, like, a description,
fingerprints, anything like that?

1136
01:42:16,754 --> 01:42:17,778
No

1137
01:42:20,425 --> 01:42:21,756
No, we don't

1138
01:42:33,137 --> 01:42:34,604
Here's that number

1139
01:42:36,107 --> 01:42:37,768
Very good, Mr. Gordon

1140
01:42:37,976 --> 01:42:39,807
May I use your phone, please?

1141
01:42:47,952 --> 01:42:49,977
Sure you can use my phone

1142
01:42:51,489 --> 01:42:52,649
Freeze£¡

1143
01:42:53,491 --> 01:42:57,552
Put your hands over your head
and turn around.  Spread your legs

1144
01:42:58,730 --> 01:42:59,992
Spread your legs£¡

1145
01:43:00,198 --> 01:43:01,927
Put your hands in the back£­£­

1146
01:43:02,133 --> 01:43:03,600
Freeze£¡

1147
01:44:16,174 --> 01:44:18,165
Hey£¡

1148
01:44:38,129 --> 01:44:40,461
Are you there?

1149
01:44:41,866 --> 01:44:44,994
I'm down here£¡  I'm down here£¡

1150
01:45:04,188 --> 01:45:05,815
Catherine Martin?

1151
01:45:06,024 --> 01:45:07,389
Yes£¡

1152
01:45:09,093 --> 01:45:10,355
FBI

1153
01:45:10,561 --> 01:45:11,858
You're safe

1154
01:45:12,063 --> 01:45:15,032
Safe, shit£¡  Get me out of here£¡

1155
01:45:30,148 --> 01:45:32,013
You're all right.  Where is he?

1156
01:45:32,216 --> 01:45:35,185
How the fuck should I know?
Just get me out of here£¡

1157
01:45:35,386 --> 01:45:38,549
Catherine, you've gotta be quiet£¡
Now, shut that dog up£¡

1158
01:45:38,756 --> 01:45:40,815
Just get me out of here£¡

1159
01:45:41,926 --> 01:45:43,086
Oh, my God

1160
01:45:45,530 --> 01:45:49,557
Catherine, I'm gonna get you out.
But right now, you listen to me

1161
01:45:49,767 --> 01:45:53,770
I've gotta leave.  I'll be right back

1162
01:45:53,770 --> 01:45:56,170
No£¡  Don't you leave me here,
you fucking bitch£¡  No£¡

1163
01:45:56,206 --> 01:45:57,730
Don't you leave me here£¡

1164
01:45:57,941 --> 01:46:00,671
This guy is fucking crazy£¡

1165
01:46:03,046 --> 01:46:07,881
Wait£¡  I gotta get out of here£¡

1166
01:46:09,386 --> 01:46:10,375
Please£¡

1167
01:46:10,587 --> 01:46:15,286
Catherine£¡  The other officers
will be here any minute now

1168
01:46:15,492 --> 01:46:19,223
Wait£¡  Don't go£¡  Please£¡

1169
01:46:19,429 --> 01:46:20,726
Quiet£¡

1170
01:46:23,033 --> 01:46:25,593
Oh, God£¡  Oh, God£¡

1171
01:50:21,404 --> 01:50:23,872
£­You okay?
£­Gunpowder.  It's nothing, I'm okay

1172
01:50:24,074 --> 01:50:27,100
Agent Starling, how did you
track Buffalo Bill here?

1173
01:50:33,416 --> 01:50:36,283
Clarice M. Starling

1174
01:50:38,455 --> 01:50:39,752
Congratulations

1175
01:50:53,269 --> 01:50:56,033

Thank you.  Excuse me

1179
01:51:19,896 --> 01:51:21,158
Starling

1180
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,867
Pilch, could you take our picture?

1181
01:51:27,103 --> 01:51:28,161
Sure

1182
01:51:30,106 --> 01:51:32,233
I just wanted to say congratulations

1183
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:36,169
I'm no good at this kind of thing,
so I'm gonna duck out of here

1184
01:51:36,646 --> 01:51:38,273
Okay.  Sure

1185
01:51:39,782 --> 01:51:41,443
Thank you, Mr. Crawford

1186
01:51:49,258 --> 01:51:51,488
Your father would've been proud today

1187
01:51:54,797 --> 01:51:56,526
Don't forget your phone call

1188
01:52:01,170 --> 01:52:02,535
Starling

1189
01:52:02,772 --> 01:52:04,364
Well, Clarice¡­

1190
01:52:04,907 --> 01:52:07,398
¡­have the lambs stopped screaming?

1191
01:52:07,844 --> 01:52:08,970
Dr. Lecter?

1192
01:52:09,178 --> 01:52:12,204
Don't bother with a trace.
I won't be on long enough

1193
01:52:15,718 --> 01:52:17,845
Where are you, Dr. Lecter?

1194
01:52:18,054 --> 01:52:19,919
I have no plans to call on you

1195
01:52:20,123 --> 01:52:22,591
The world's more interesting
with you in it

1196
01:52:23,126 --> 01:52:26,118
So you take care now
to extend me the same courtesy

1197
01:52:26,329 --> 01:52:28,854
You know I can't make that promise

1198
01:52:29,332 --> 01:52:31,698
I do wish we could chat longer¡­

1199
01:52:33,002 --> 01:52:35,698
¡­but I'm having
an old friend for dinner

1200
01:52:37,173 --> 01:52:38,435
Bye

1201
01:52:38,908 --> 01:52:40,239
Dr. Lecter!

Dr. Lecter

Dr. Lecter?

1205
01:52:52,388 --> 01:52:53,787
Excuse me.  I'm sorry

1206
01:52:53,990 --> 01:52:55,651
The security system's set up?

1207
01:52:55,858 --> 01:52:58,520
-We have the big shot security.
£­I appreciate it
