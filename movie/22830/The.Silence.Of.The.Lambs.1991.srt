<<<<<<Subs By SIVACHERRY>>>>>>

1
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,258
Starling!

2
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:57,138
Crawford wants to see you
in his office.

3
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,203
Thank you, sir.

4
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,792
- Clarice.
- Hey.

5
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,008
Looking for Crawford?

6
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:44,411
He should be back soon.
Why don't you wait in his office?

7
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,074
Starling.

8
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:47,244
- Clarice M. Good morning.
- Morning, Mr. Crawford.

9
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,746
Sorry to pull you off the course
at such short notice.

10
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,885
Your instructors say you're
in the top quarter of your class.

11
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:57,416
I hope so. They haven't posted
any grades yet.

12
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,190
A job's come up,
and I thought about you.

13
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,021
Not a job, really,
more of an interesting errand.

14
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,422
Sit down.

15
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:05,986
Yes, sir.

16
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:11,037
I remember you from my seminar at UVA.

17
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:15,672
You grilled me on the bureau's civil
rights record in the Hoover years.

18
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,864
I gave you an A.

19
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,469
A minus, sir.

20
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,408
Double major, psych and criminology,
graduated magna.

21
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,381
Summer internships
at the Reitzinger Clinic.

22
00:06:27,586 --> 00:06:32,353
It says when you graduate you want
to work for me in Behavioral Science.

23
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,616
Yes, very much, sir. Very much.

24
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,629
We're interviewing
all serial killers in custody...

25
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,662
...for a psycho-behavioral profile.

26
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,660
It could be a real help
in unsolved cases.

27
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:46,429
Most of them have been happy
to talk to us.

28
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:48,564
Do you spook easily, Starling?

29
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,704
Not yet, sir.

30
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,805
The one we want most refuses to help.

31
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,447
I want you to go after him
in the asylum.

32
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,280
Who's the subject?

33
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:02,954
- The psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter.
- "Hannibal the Cannibal."

34
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,749
I don't expect him to talk to you...

35
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,960
...but I have to be able
to say we tried.

36
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:13,127
If he won't cooperate,
I want straight reporting.

37
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:15,163
How's he look? How's his cell?

38
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:18,928
Is he sketching, drawing?
If he is, what's he sketching?

39
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,437
Here's a dossier on Lecter...

40
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:30,615
...copy of our questionnaire
and an I.D. for you.

41
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:33,808
Have your memo on my desk
by 0800, Wednesday.

42
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:35,179
Okay.

43
00:07:37,756 --> 00:07:40,782
Excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?

44
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,722
Lecter's been in prison for years.

45
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:46,022
Is there some connection
between him and Buffalo Bill?

46
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:50,066
I wish there were. Now, I want
your full attention, Starling.

47
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:54,695
- Yes, sir.
- Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.

48
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:59,337
Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over
all the physical procedures used.

49
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,440
Do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever.

50
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,708
You're to tell him nothing personal.

51
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:09,321
You don't want Hannibal Lecter
inside your head.

52
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,684
Just do your job
but never forget what he is.

53
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,251
And what is that?

54
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:18,624
<i>Oh, he's a monster, a pure psychopath.</i>

55
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,223
It's so rare to capture one alive.

56
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:25,460
From a research point of view,
Lecter is our most prized asset.

57
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,366
We get a lot of detectives here...

58
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:34,842
...but I must say I can't remember
one as attractive.

59
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,882
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?

60
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:43,851
Because this can be quite a fun town
if you have the right guide.

61
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:48,624
I'm sure this is a great town,
Dr. Chilton...

62
00:08:48,827 --> 00:08:52,695
...but I must talk to Dr. Lecter
and report back this afternoon.

63
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:56,466
I see. Well, let's make
this quick, then.

64
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:01,229
We've tried to study him, but he's too
sophisticated for the standard tests.

65
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,670
Oh, my, does he hate us.

66
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,969
He thinks I'm his nemesis.

67
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:10,174
Crawford's very clever,
isn't he, using you?

68
00:09:10,482 --> 00:09:14,782
- What do you mean, sir?
- Pretty young woman to turn him on.

69
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:20,224
I don't believe Lecter's seen a woman
in eight years, and you are his taste.

70
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,924
So to speak.

71
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:25,062
I graduated from UVA.
It's not a charm school.

72
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:28,529
Good. Then you should be able
to remember the rules.

73
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:35,271
Do not touch or approach the glass.
Pass him nothing but soft paper.

74
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:39,205
No pencils or pens, no staples
or paper clips in his paper.

75
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:41,743
Use the sliding food carrier,
no exceptions.

76
00:09:41,947 --> 00:09:44,142
If he passes you anything,
do not accept.

77
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,818
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I understand, sir.

78
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,380
I'm going to show you why we insist
on such precautions.

79
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,058
On the afternoon of July 8, 1981...

80
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,161
...he complained of chest pains
and was taken to the dispensary.

81
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,831
His mouthpiece was removed for an EKG.

82
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:03,024
When the nurse leaned over him,
he did this to her.

83
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:10,207
The doctors managed to reset her jaw,
more or less. Save one of her eyes.

84
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:15,305
His pulse never got above 85,
even when he ate her tongue.

85
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,448
- I keep him in here.
- Dr. Chilton.

86
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:25,614
If Lecter feels
that you're his enemy, then...

87
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:28,224
Maybe we'll have more luck
if I go by myself.

88
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,925
What do you think?

89
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:36,562
You might have suggested this
in my office and saved me the time.

90
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,031
Yes, sir, but then I would have missed
the pleasure of your company, sir.

91
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,245
When she's finished, bring her out.

92
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:20,402
Hi, I'm Barney. He told you,
don't get near the glass?

93
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,878
Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.

94
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,742
Nice to meet you. You can hang
your coat there if you like.

95
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,147
Okay. Thank you, I will.

96
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,783
He's past the others.
The last cell.

97
00:11:33,992 --> 00:11:35,755
You keep to the right.

98
00:11:38,163 --> 00:11:41,599
- I put out a chair for you.
- Yes, that's very good, thank you.

99
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,905
I'll be watching. You'll do fine.

100
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:19,093
I can smell your cunt.

101
00:12:33,218 --> 00:12:34,207
Good morning.

102
00:12:34,853 --> 00:12:38,289
Dr. Lecter, my name is Clarice
Starling. May I speak with you?

103
00:12:38,989 --> 00:12:41,321
You're one of Jack Crawford's,
aren't you?

104
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:42,885
I am, yes.

105
00:12:44,128 --> 00:12:46,028
May I see your credentials?

106
00:12:46,697 --> 00:12:47,686
Certainly.

107
00:12:54,938 --> 00:12:56,530
Closer, please.

108
00:12:58,442 --> 00:12:59,966
Closer.

109
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:20,453
That expires in one week.
You're not real FBI, are you?

110
00:13:20,931 --> 00:13:23,399
I'm still in training at the academy.

111
00:13:24,601 --> 00:13:29,538
- Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
- Yes, I'm a student.

112
00:13:29,773 --> 00:13:31,764
I'm here to learn from you.

113
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:35,172
Maybe you can decide
if I'm qualified enough to do that.

114
00:13:38,615 --> 00:13:41,709
That is rather slippery of you,
Agent Starling.

115
00:13:45,255 --> 00:13:46,916
Sit. Please.

116
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:58,290
Now then, tell me.
What did Miggs say to you?

117
00:13:58,502 --> 00:14:01,096
"Multiple Miggs" in the next cell.

118
00:14:01,305 --> 00:14:04,433
He hissed at you. What did he say?

119
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:08,778
He said, "I can smell your cunt."

120
00:14:09,146 --> 00:14:10,408
I see.

121
00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:13,774
I myself cannot.

122
00:14:22,826 --> 00:14:25,488
You use Evyan skin cream.

123
00:14:27,965 --> 00:14:30,900
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps.

124
00:14:32,302 --> 00:14:33,826
But not today.

125
00:14:36,106 --> 00:14:37,903
Did you do all these drawings?

126
00:14:40,978 --> 00:14:44,345
That is the <i>Duomo,</i> seen
from the Belvedere.

127
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:47,377
Do you know Florence?

128
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:50,320
All that detail just from memory, sir?

129
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:55,115
Memory, Agent Starling, is what
I have instead of a view.

130
00:14:55,826 --> 00:15:00,422
Perhaps you'd care to lend us
your view on this questionnaire, sir.

131
00:15:00,631 --> 00:15:05,068
No, no, no. You were doing fine.

132
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:08,261
You had been courteous
and receptive to courtesy.

133
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:12,932
You had established trust with
the embarrassing truth about Miggs.

134
00:15:13,177 --> 00:15:17,807
And now this ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire.

135
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:20,414
It won't do.

136
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:24,754
I'm only asking you to look at this.
Either you will or you won't.

137
00:15:24,988 --> 00:15:28,617
Yeah. Jack Crawford must be
very busy indeed...

138
00:15:28,826 --> 00:15:31,351
...if he's recruiting help
from the student body.

139
00:15:31,762 --> 00:15:34,424
Busy hunting that new one,
Buffalo Bill.

140
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:36,929
What a naughty boy he is.

141
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:40,599
Do you know why he's called
"Buffalo Bill"?

142
00:15:40,804 --> 00:15:44,137
Please tell me.
The newspapers won't say.

143
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:47,607
It started as a joke
in Kansas City Homicide.

144
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:52,043
They said, "This one likes
to skin his humps."

145
00:15:53,383 --> 00:15:54,680
Why do you think...

146
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:58,685
...he removes their skins,
Agent Starling?

147
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:01,153
Thrill me with your acumen.

148
00:16:01,925 --> 00:16:03,517
It excites him.

149
00:16:03,727 --> 00:16:06,787
Most serial killers keep
trophies from their victims.

150
00:16:07,564 --> 00:16:09,691
- I didn't.
- No.

151
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,567
No, you ate yours.

152
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:16,338
You send that through now.

153
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:47,836
You think you can dissect
me with this blunt little tool?

154
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,437
No! I thought
that your knowledge...

155
00:16:51,642 --> 00:16:53,940
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

156
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:57,938
You know what you look like, with
your good bag and your cheap shoes?

157
00:16:58,148 --> 00:16:59,581
You look like a rube.

158
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,380
A well-scrubbed, hustling rube
with a little taste.

159
00:17:05,188 --> 00:17:07,418
Nutrition has given you
some length of bone...

160
00:17:07,624 --> 00:17:10,787
...but you're not more than one
generation from white trash...

161
00:17:10,994 --> 00:17:12,825
...are you, Agent Starling?

162
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,828
The accent you've tried
so desperately to shed...

163
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:18,092
...pure West Virginia.

164
00:17:18,302 --> 00:17:20,361
Is your father a coal miner?

165
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:22,300
Does he stink of the lamp?

166
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:27,372
I know how quickly the boys found you,
all those tedious, sticky fumblings...

167
00:17:27,578 --> 00:17:31,014
...in the back seats of cars,
while you dreamed of getting out.

168
00:17:31,214 --> 00:17:32,579
Getting anywhere.

169
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:36,410
Getting all the way to the FBI.

170
00:17:39,723 --> 00:17:42,521
You see a lot, doctor.

171
00:17:42,726 --> 00:17:45,194
But are you strong enough
to point that...

172
00:17:45,395 --> 00:17:47,920
...high-powered
perception at yourself?

173
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:50,058
What about it?

174
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:54,431
Why don't you look at yourself
and write down what you see?

175
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:56,367
Or maybe you're afraid to.

176
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:09,016
A census taker once tried to test me.

177
00:18:09,219 --> 00:18:12,552
I ate his liver
with some fava beans...

178
00:18:12,756 --> 00:18:15,054
...and a nice Chianti.

179
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:26,233
You fly back to school now,
little Starling.

180
00:18:27,137 --> 00:18:28,627
Fly, fly, fly.

181
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,520
I bit my wrist...

182
00:18:45,756 --> 00:18:47,958
...so I could die.

183
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:50,454
Look at the blood!

184
00:18:51,394 --> 00:18:52,793
Gotcha.

185
00:18:53,196 --> 00:18:55,289
Miggs! You stupid fuck!

186
00:18:59,803 --> 00:19:03,671
Agent Starling! Come back!
Agent Starling! Agent Starling!

187
00:19:03,873 --> 00:19:06,967
I would not have had that happen.
Discourtesy is ugly to me.

188
00:19:07,177 --> 00:19:09,611
- Then do this test!
- No, but I will make you happy.

189
00:19:09,813 --> 00:19:12,338
- I'll give you a chance at your love.
- What?

190
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:17,316
Advancement. Listen. Look deep
within yourself, Clarice Starling.

191
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,718
Go seek out Miss Mofet,
an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T.

192
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:24,550
I don't think Miggs could
manage again so soon...

193
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:26,991
...even though he is crazy.
Go now!

194
00:20:08,505 --> 00:20:09,699
Hi, Bill.

195
00:20:14,477 --> 00:20:16,206
- Daddy!
- Hey, Clarice.

196
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,977
- Did you get any bad guys, Daddy?
- No, angel. They all got away.

197
00:20:24,187 --> 00:20:25,677
Ah, shoot.

198
00:20:46,042 --> 00:20:48,306
FBI! Hands up! Don't move!

199
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:52,038
Turn around. Hands behind your back.
Thumbs up.

200
00:20:56,052 --> 00:20:57,849
You're dead, Starling.

201
00:20:58,388 --> 00:21:02,518
Johnson, good entry, good command.
Starling, where's your danger area?

202
00:21:02,725 --> 00:21:04,124
- In the corner.
- Did you check it?

203
00:21:04,327 --> 00:21:05,919
- No, sir.
- That's why you're dead.

204
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:09,255
3-1-0-9?

205
00:21:09,466 --> 00:21:13,903
Breaking doors or windows
to enter or exit.

206
00:21:14,871 --> 00:21:16,133
Rule 404?

207
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:37,323
Clarice, phone. It's the guru.

208
00:21:37,527 --> 00:21:39,154
Crawford? Thanks, Ardelia.

209
00:21:39,629 --> 00:21:42,063
- Starling?
<i>- Sir.</i>

210
00:21:42,265 --> 00:21:43,698
Miggs is dead.

211
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:45,857
Dead?

212
00:21:46,736 --> 00:21:47,964
How?

213
00:21:48,705 --> 00:21:51,765
The orderly heard Lecter whispering
to him all afternoon.

214
00:21:51,975 --> 00:21:54,569
They found him at bed check.
He'd swallowed his tongue.

215
00:21:57,614 --> 00:21:58,706
Starling?

216
00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:02,275
Yeah. I'm still here, sir. I just...

217
00:22:02,485 --> 00:22:04,214
I don't know how to feel about this.

218
00:22:04,787 --> 00:22:08,223
You don't have to feel any way.
Lecter did it to amuse himself.

219
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:11,493
Look, I know it got ugly today...

220
00:22:12,028 --> 00:22:16,362
...but you mentioned a name,
"Mofet." Any follow-up on her?

221
00:22:18,001 --> 00:22:21,164
He destroyed most of his patients'
histories prior to capture...

222
00:22:21,371 --> 00:22:24,863
...so there's no record
of anyone named Mofet.

223
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:29,170
But I thought the "yourself" reference
was too hokey for Lecter...

224
00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:33,543
...so I figured he's from Baltimore,
and I looked in the phone book.

225
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:37,015
And there's a
"Your Self" storage facility...

226
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,711
<i>... right outside</i>
<i>of downtown Baltimore, sir.</i>

227
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:44,155
Unit 31 was leased...

228
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,625
...for 10 years, prepaid in full.

229
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,764
The contract was in the name...

230
00:22:49,966 --> 00:22:53,732
...of a Miss Hester Mofet.

231
00:22:53,937 --> 00:22:56,565
So nobody's been
in here since 1980?

232
00:22:56,773 --> 00:22:58,570
Not to my knowledge.

233
00:22:59,142 --> 00:23:02,908
Privacy is a great concern
to my customers.

234
00:23:03,646 --> 00:23:05,739
Yes, I won't disturb anything,
I promise.

235
00:23:05,949 --> 00:23:07,974
I'll be out of here
before you know it.

236
00:23:08,518 --> 00:23:10,816
- May I help you?
- Yes, actually.

237
00:23:11,187 --> 00:23:12,176
Here.

238
00:23:17,126 --> 00:23:20,721
- It's stuck.
- We could return tomorrow with my son.

239
00:23:21,531 --> 00:23:23,021
What about him?

240
00:23:24,434 --> 00:23:29,371
I would ask my driver to help you,
but he detests physical labor.

241
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:31,097
Right.

242
00:23:31,808 --> 00:23:34,436
You stay here.
I'll be back in one minute.

243
00:24:07,076 --> 00:24:09,670
It's stuck. Will you hand me
that flashlight?

244
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,858
If this door should fall down...

245
00:24:27,397 --> 00:24:29,831
...or anything else...

246
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:32,297
...this is the number
for our Baltimore office.

247
00:24:32,835 --> 00:24:34,462
They know that you're with me.

248
00:24:34,771 --> 00:24:38,366
- Call them if anything should happen.
- Yes, Miss Starling.

249
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:12,184
Clarice. Here, they're waiting
for you.

250
00:27:12,395 --> 00:27:13,919
Watch your step.

251
00:27:15,131 --> 00:27:19,158
Hester Mofet. It's an anagram,
isn't it, doctor?

252
00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:22,361
Hester Mofet: "The rest of me"?

253
00:27:22,772 --> 00:27:26,708
"Miss The Rest Of Me," meaning
that you rented that garage?

254
00:28:02,546 --> 00:28:03,570
Thank you.

255
00:28:04,781 --> 00:28:06,112
Your bleeding has stopped.

256
00:28:08,618 --> 00:28:09,778
How did?

257
00:28:11,788 --> 00:28:12,812
It's nothing.

258
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,023
It's just a scratch.

259
00:28:16,626 --> 00:28:18,890
Dr. Lecter, whose head
is in that bottle?

260
00:28:19,095 --> 00:28:22,223
Why don't you ask me
about Buffalo Bill?

261
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:24,126
Do you know something about him?

262
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:28,064
I might if I saw the case file.
You could get that for me.

263
00:28:28,638 --> 00:28:31,607
Let's talk about Miss Mofet.
You wanted me to find him.

264
00:28:32,742 --> 00:28:37,736
His real name is Benjamin Raspail.
A former patient of mine...

265
00:28:38,315 --> 00:28:42,877
...whose romantic attachments
ran to, shall we say, the exotic.

266
00:28:43,453 --> 00:28:47,685
I did not kill him, merely tucked
him away, very much as I found him...

267
00:28:47,891 --> 00:28:50,257
...after he'd missed
three appointments.

268
00:28:51,494 --> 00:28:53,553
If you didn't kill him, who did?

269
00:28:53,964 --> 00:28:56,865
Who can say?
Best thing for him, really.

270
00:28:57,067 --> 00:28:59,467
His therapy was going nowhere.

271
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:03,064
His dress, makeup...

272
00:29:03,506 --> 00:29:05,098
Raspail was a transvestite?

273
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:09,972
In life? Oh, no.
Garden variety manic-depressive.

274
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,648
Tedious, very tedious.

275
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:15,249
I now think of him as an experiment.

276
00:29:15,485 --> 00:29:18,977
A fledgling killer's first effort
at transformation.

277
00:29:19,189 --> 00:29:21,987
How did you feel when you saw him,
Clarice?

278
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:24,293
Scared at first, then...

279
00:29:25,362 --> 00:29:26,659
...exhilarated.

280
00:29:27,297 --> 00:29:29,492
Jack Crawford is helping your career,
isn't he?

281
00:29:29,699 --> 00:29:32,429
Apparently, he likes you
and you like him too.

282
00:29:33,203 --> 00:29:34,898
I never thought about it.

283
00:29:35,472 --> 00:29:38,100
Do you think Jack Crawford
wants you, sexually?

284
00:29:38,308 --> 00:29:43,439
He is much older, but do you think
he visualizes scenarios, exchanges?

285
00:29:43,647 --> 00:29:44,807
Fucking you?

286
00:29:47,884 --> 00:29:52,981
That doesn't interest me. It's the
sort of thing that Miggs would say.

287
00:29:55,025 --> 00:29:56,549
Not anymore.

288
00:30:04,167 --> 00:30:05,794
Thank you, Barney.

289
00:30:09,706 --> 00:30:11,697
What happened to your drawings?

290
00:30:13,343 --> 00:30:17,712
Punishment, you see, for Miggs.
Just like that gospel program.

291
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:20,812
When you leave, they'll turn
the volume way up.

292
00:30:21,151 --> 00:30:24,314
Dr. Chilton does enjoy
his petty torments.

293
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:27,351
What did you mean
by "transformation," doctor?

294
00:30:36,499 --> 00:30:39,866
I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice.

295
00:30:40,203 --> 00:30:43,604
I know they will never
ever let me out while I'm alive.

296
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:46,568
What I want is a view.

297
00:30:46,776 --> 00:30:50,576
I want a window where I can see a tree
or even water.

298
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:54,409
I want to be in a federal institution
far away from Dr. Chilton.

299
00:30:54,617 --> 00:30:56,983
What did you mean
by "fledgling killer"?

300
00:30:57,187 --> 00:30:59,018
Are you saying he's killed again?

301
00:30:59,322 --> 00:31:02,519
I'm offering you a psychological
profile on Buffalo Bill...

302
00:31:02,726 --> 00:31:04,819
...based on the case evidence.

303
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,569
I'll help you catch him, Clarice.

304
00:31:19,342 --> 00:31:21,401
You know who he is, don't you?

305
00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:25,008
Tell me who decapitated
your patient, doctor.

306
00:31:25,214 --> 00:31:28,012
All good things to those who wait.

307
00:31:28,484 --> 00:31:32,580
I've waited, Clarice. But how long
can you and old Jackie-boy wait?

308
00:31:33,156 --> 00:31:38,321
Our little Billy must already be
searching for that next special lady.

309
00:32:41,491 --> 00:32:43,584
Hey, little cheeper.

310
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:53,593
I'll be right there.

311
00:33:13,389 --> 00:33:14,219
Jeez!

312
00:33:20,329 --> 00:33:21,990
Can I help you with that?

313
00:33:23,132 --> 00:33:24,099
Would you?

314
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,392
Sure.

315
00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:26,999
Thank you.

316
00:33:27,203 --> 00:33:29,501
That's all right. You look
kind of handicapped.

317
00:33:29,706 --> 00:33:33,699
Yeah. I got it this far, I just can't
get it up in the truck by myself.

318
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,775
Here, grab this. Up!

319
00:33:36,112 --> 00:33:37,170
Okay.

320
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,780
Just set it down. That's good.

321
00:33:39,982 --> 00:33:43,782
Get in the truck. I want to
push it all the way up.

322
00:33:43,986 --> 00:33:46,079
I really appreciate this.
Thank you.

323
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:50,657
Just go all the way back.

324
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,925
Okay. Is this good?

325
00:33:53,129 --> 00:33:54,960
Yeah, that's good.

326
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,162
- That's great.
- Okay.

327
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:01,492
Say, are you
about a size 14?

328
00:34:01,704 --> 00:34:02,864
Sorry?

329
00:34:24,127 --> 00:34:25,424
Good.

330
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:47,709
Oh, good. Good.

331
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:04,665
<i>Holds!</i>

332
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,762
Ones!

333
00:35:16,913 --> 00:35:18,540
Starling!

334
00:35:20,883 --> 00:35:23,351
Outside. Let's go.

335
00:35:23,753 --> 00:35:27,120
Cindy, in the ring for Starling.
Let's go!

336
00:35:36,933 --> 00:35:38,230
Pack your field gear.

337
00:35:38,434 --> 00:35:40,129
- You're going with Crawford.
- Where?

338
00:35:40,336 --> 00:35:41,997
Found a girl's body
in West Virginia.

339
00:35:42,205 --> 00:35:44,901
Been in the water a week.
Looks like Buffalo Bill.

340
00:35:56,986 --> 00:36:00,012
Keeps them alive for three days.
We don't know why.

341
00:36:00,223 --> 00:36:03,317
No evidence of rape or
physical abuse prior to death.

342
00:36:03,526 --> 00:36:06,017
All the mutilation you see
there is postmortem.

343
00:36:06,762 --> 00:36:08,753
Okay, three days...

344
00:36:08,965 --> 00:36:12,196
...then he shoots them, skins them
and dumps them.

345
00:36:12,401 --> 00:36:14,096
Each body in a different river.

346
00:36:14,303 --> 00:36:17,431
The water leaves us no trace
evidence of any kind.

347
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,074
That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one.

348
00:36:20,276 --> 00:36:23,143
Her body was the only one he
weighted down.

349
00:36:23,346 --> 00:36:26,179
So actually, she was
the third girl found.

350
00:36:26,382 --> 00:36:28,612
After her, he got lazy.

351
00:36:30,419 --> 00:36:33,183
Okay, let's see.

352
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:37,587
Circles where the girls were abducted.
Arrows where their bodies were found.

353
00:36:37,793 --> 00:36:42,856
This new one today washed up here.
Elk River, West Virginia.

354
00:37:02,485 --> 00:37:05,249
Look at him, Starling.
Tell me what you see.

355
00:37:06,455 --> 00:37:07,922
Well, he's a white male.

356
00:37:08,124 --> 00:37:11,093
Serial killers tend to hunt
within their own ethnic groups.

357
00:37:11,894 --> 00:37:16,228
He's not a drifter. He's got his
own house, not an apartment.

358
00:37:16,766 --> 00:37:20,099
- Why?
- What he does with them takes privacy.

359
00:37:20,303 --> 00:37:24,740
He's in his 30s or 40s.
He's got real physical strength.

360
00:37:24,941 --> 00:37:30,277
Combined with an older man's
self-control. He's cautious, precise.

361
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,574
And he's never impulsive.
He'll never stop.

362
00:37:34,317 --> 00:37:36,085
Why not?

363
00:37:36,952 --> 00:37:40,581
He's got a real taste for it now,
and he's getting better at his work.

364
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:45,089
Not bad, Starling. Questions?

365
00:37:45,627 --> 00:37:47,094
Yes, sir.

366
00:37:47,296 --> 00:37:51,062
You haven't mentioned anything about
the information in my report...

367
00:37:51,266 --> 00:37:52,665
...or Dr. Lecter's offer, sir.

368
00:37:52,868 --> 00:37:54,665
I'm considering it.

369
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:57,805
That's why you sent me
in there, isn't it?

370
00:37:58,006 --> 00:38:00,065
To get his help on Buffalo Bill, sir?

371
00:38:03,178 --> 00:38:05,840
Well, if that was the case, then...

372
00:38:06,048 --> 00:38:08,812
...I just wish I was in on it,
that's all.

373
00:38:09,017 --> 00:38:13,113
If I'd sent you in there with a real
agenda, Lecter would have known it.

374
00:38:13,322 --> 00:38:16,951
He would have toyed with you,
then turned to stone.

375
00:38:50,492 --> 00:38:52,289
Excuse me, Sheriff Perkins?

376
00:38:52,494 --> 00:38:53,756
These are the FBI people.

377
00:38:53,962 --> 00:38:59,025
Sheriff Perkins, Jack Crawford, FBI.
Special Agent Terry, Agent Starling.

378
00:38:59,234 --> 00:39:01,896
We appreciate being invited
to your jurisdiction.

379
00:39:02,104 --> 00:39:05,335
Somebody from the state attorney's
office called you.

380
00:39:05,541 --> 00:39:07,600
We'll extend you every courtesy,
but right now...

381
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:09,071
Sheriff...

382
00:39:09,811 --> 00:39:14,544
...this type of sex crime has aspects
I'd just as soon discuss in private.

383
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,342
Know what I mean?

384
00:41:07,229 --> 00:41:09,629
Oscar, fetch Dr. Akin
from the chapel.

385
00:41:09,831 --> 00:41:10,855
We're back here.

386
00:41:11,066 --> 00:41:14,229
Tell Lamar to come on when
he's finished playing his music.

387
00:41:14,503 --> 00:41:16,903
Yeah, we'll be sending in a minute.

388
00:41:18,073 --> 00:41:20,007
It's working.

389
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:23,507
I need a six-way link up.
Chicago, Detroit...

390
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,111
What? What?

391
00:41:30,052 --> 00:41:31,747
Excuse me.

392
00:41:31,953 --> 00:41:35,218
Excuse me, officers and gentlemen.
Listen here, now.

393
00:41:35,424 --> 00:41:37,619
There's things we need to do
for her.

394
00:41:37,826 --> 00:41:41,353
Y'all brought her this far, and her
folks would thank you if they could...

395
00:41:41,563 --> 00:41:44,157
...for your kindness
and your sensitivity.

396
00:41:44,366 --> 00:41:47,096
Please, go on now,
and let us take care of her.

397
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,362
Go on, now.

398
00:41:52,674 --> 00:41:54,642
Thank you.

399
00:41:57,779 --> 00:41:59,076
Thank you.

400
00:42:00,782 --> 00:42:02,113
Okay, good.

401
00:42:10,459 --> 00:42:15,123
Yeah, that's right. Elk River.
Stand by for transmission.

402
00:42:19,267 --> 00:42:20,234
Ray.

403
00:42:32,748 --> 00:42:35,478
Doctor, Lamar.
Let's take a look at her.

404
00:42:52,634 --> 00:42:53,692
Jesus...

405
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:02,167
Okay, Starling.

406
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:29,668
Star-shaped contact entrance
wound over the sternum.

407
00:43:31,606 --> 00:43:33,471
A muzzle stamp at the top.

408
00:43:33,675 --> 00:43:36,769
- Wrongful death.
- Wrongful death.

409
00:43:37,012 --> 00:43:40,311
She'll have to go to the state
pathologist's at Claxton.

410
00:43:40,515 --> 00:43:42,608
Well, I better get back
to that service.

411
00:43:42,818 --> 00:43:44,149
Lamar will help you.

412
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,013
Lord Almighty.

413
00:43:50,892 --> 00:43:52,985
What else do you see, Starling?

414
00:43:54,162 --> 00:43:57,598
Well, she's not local.

415
00:43:57,799 --> 00:44:00,632
Her ears are pierced three times
and there's...

416
00:44:02,137 --> 00:44:05,072
...glitter nail polish.
It looks like town to me.

417
00:44:11,045 --> 00:44:14,310
Two of her fingernails
are broken off...

418
00:44:14,515 --> 00:44:16,813
...and there's dirt or grit
under them.

419
00:44:17,017 --> 00:44:20,077
It looks like she's tried to claw her
way through something.

420
00:44:20,587 --> 00:44:23,317
Ray, get pictures of her teeth.
We'll fax them to Missing Persons.

421
00:44:23,524 --> 00:44:24,752
Right.

422
00:44:34,401 --> 00:44:35,732
Let's do another.

423
00:44:44,912 --> 00:44:46,504
She's got something in her throat.

424
00:44:47,881 --> 00:44:49,974
When a body comes out
of the water...

425
00:44:50,184 --> 00:44:52,846
...lots of times there's
leaves and things in the mouth.

426
00:45:24,251 --> 00:45:25,445
What is that?

427
00:45:25,652 --> 00:45:27,244
Some kind of seedpod?

428
00:45:27,454 --> 00:45:30,321
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.

429
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:33,518
There's no way that could get
way down in there.

430
00:45:33,727 --> 00:45:36,457
Not unless somebody
shoved it in there.

431
00:45:38,866 --> 00:45:41,061
She'll be easier to print
when we turn her.

432
00:45:41,268 --> 00:45:42,599
Lamar, give me a hand?

433
00:45:42,803 --> 00:45:44,293
Yes, sir, I will.

434
00:45:48,642 --> 00:45:52,442
Oh, Jack.
What do you make of these?

435
00:45:52,646 --> 00:45:55,809
Different configuration than
the other victims. Get close-ups.

436
00:45:56,016 --> 00:45:57,608
Victim's skin removed...

437
00:45:57,818 --> 00:46:00,912
...in two diamond-shaped sections
above the buttocks.

438
00:46:01,121 --> 00:46:04,318
Exit wound level with the second
or third thoracic vertebrae...

439
00:46:04,525 --> 00:46:07,392
<i>... approximately six inches from</i>
<i>the right shoulder blade.</i>

440
00:46:07,594 --> 00:46:08,993
Starling...

441
00:46:10,097 --> 00:46:13,589
...when I told that sheriff we
shouldn't talk in front of a woman...

442
00:46:13,801 --> 00:46:15,393
...that burned you, didn't it?

443
00:46:15,602 --> 00:46:19,060
It was just smoke, Starling.
I had to get rid of him.

444
00:46:19,273 --> 00:46:21,070
It matters, Mr. Crawford.

445
00:46:21,275 --> 00:46:23,402
Cops look at you to see how to act.

446
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:25,077
It matters.

447
00:46:25,312 --> 00:46:26,609
Point taken.

448
00:46:32,586 --> 00:46:34,816
Ligature marks found around wrists...

449
00:46:35,022 --> 00:46:36,683
<i>... not around the ankles.</i>

450
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:39,723
<i>This would indicate that</i>
<i>the skinning was postmortem.</i>

451
00:47:03,584 --> 00:47:04,642
Time, Pilch. My move.

452
00:47:04,852 --> 00:47:09,755
- No fair! You lured him with produce.
- Tough noogies. It's still my turn.

453
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:12,158
Nice and slow, baby.

454
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:15,858
If the beetle moves one of your men,
does that still count?

455
00:47:17,464 --> 00:47:19,659
Of course it counts. How do you play?

456
00:47:20,834 --> 00:47:23,462
Agent Starling?

457
00:47:23,904 --> 00:47:25,599
<i>Where the heck did this come from?</i>

458
00:47:25,973 --> 00:47:27,565
It's practically mush.

459
00:47:27,774 --> 00:47:32,006
It was found in a murder victim.
The body was in the Elk River.

460
00:47:32,212 --> 00:47:33,679
It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?

461
00:47:33,881 --> 00:47:35,212
I can't tell you any more.

462
00:47:35,415 --> 00:47:36,609
We heard it on the radio.

463
00:47:36,817 --> 00:47:40,116
You mean this is a clue
from a real murder case? Cool!

464
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,948
Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.

465
00:47:43,357 --> 00:47:46,087
<i>Sphingid Ceratomia,</i> maybe...

466
00:47:46,293 --> 00:47:48,921
Boy, he's a big sucker.

467
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:51,027
Okay...

468
00:47:51,231 --> 00:47:53,199
...let's check morphology.

469
00:48:02,075 --> 00:48:04,771
What do you do when you're not
detecting, Agent Starling?

470
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,604
Try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.

471
00:48:09,149 --> 00:48:11,709
You ever go out for
cheeseburgers and beer?

472
00:48:12,953 --> 00:48:14,784
The amusing house wine?

473
00:48:14,988 --> 00:48:16,819
Are you hitting on me, doctor?

474
00:48:17,658 --> 00:48:19,523
- Yes.
- Gotcha!

475
00:48:19,726 --> 00:48:20,590
What do you got?

476
00:48:20,794 --> 00:48:25,663
Agent Starling,
meet Mr. <i>Acherontia Styx.</i>

477
00:48:25,866 --> 00:48:26,958
Weird.

478
00:48:27,167 --> 00:48:30,364
Better known to his friends
as the Death's-head moth.

479
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,730
Where does it come from?

480
00:48:31,939 --> 00:48:34,874
That's what's strange.
They only live in Asia.

481
00:48:35,075 --> 00:48:37,703
They're specially raised from
imported eggs.

482
00:48:37,911 --> 00:48:41,278
Somebody grew this guy.
Fed him honey and nightshade.

483
00:48:41,481 --> 00:48:43,278
Kept him warm.

484
00:48:44,051 --> 00:48:45,848
Somebody loved him.

485
00:49:19,953 --> 00:49:21,784
Where are you?!

486
00:49:22,889 --> 00:49:25,289
Let me out of here!

487
00:49:31,365 --> 00:49:32,559
Hey!

488
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,200
Please help me!

489
00:49:38,939 --> 00:49:41,066
Help me, please!

490
00:49:41,274 --> 00:49:43,799
Why won't you answer me?! Please!

491
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:50,011
<i>- Good morning. I'm Donna Ferucchi.</i>
<i>- I'm Gene Cassel with sports.</i>

492
00:49:50,217 --> 00:49:53,209
<i>And I'm Tim Langhorn.</i>
<i>Our top story this morning:</i>

493
00:49:53,553 --> 00:49:57,819
<i>Catherine Martin, the 25-year-old</i>
<i>daughter of Senator Ruth Martin...</i>

494
00:49:58,025 --> 00:49:59,356
<i>... listed as a missing person...</i>

495
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:04,053
<i>... is believed to have been kidnapped</i>
<i>by the killer known as "Buffalo Bill."</i>

496
00:50:04,264 --> 00:50:07,700
<i>Memphis police say the missing girl's</i>
<i>blouse has been identified...</i>

497
00:50:07,901 --> 00:50:12,463
<i>... sliced up the back, in what has</i>
<i>become a kind of grim calling card.</i>

498
00:50:12,672 --> 00:50:16,608
<i>Young Catherine is the only daughter</i>
<i>of U.S. Senator Ruth Martin...</i>

499
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,835
<i>... the Republican senator</i>
<i>from Tennessee.</i>

500
00:50:19,046 --> 00:50:22,675
<i>And while her kidnapping is not</i>
<i>considered politically motivated...</i>

501
00:50:22,883 --> 00:50:25,818
<i>... it has stirred the government</i>
<i>to its highest levels.</i>

502
00:50:26,019 --> 00:50:28,817
<i>Reached for comment on the ski</i>
<i>slopes of Vermont...</i>

503
00:50:29,022 --> 00:50:32,583
<i>... the president himself said to be,</i>
<i>and I quote, "intensely concerned."</i>

504
00:50:32,793 --> 00:50:37,389
<i>Just moments ago, Senator Martin</i>
<i>taped this dramatic personal plea:</i>

505
00:50:37,597 --> 00:50:41,397
<i>I'm speaking, now, to the person</i>
<i>holding my daughter.</i>

506
00:50:42,502 --> 00:50:45,938
<i>Catherine is very gentle and kind.</i>

507
00:50:46,373 --> 00:50:48,671
<i>Talk to her and you'll see.</i>

508
00:50:50,043 --> 00:50:53,911
<i>You have the power.</i>
<i>You are in charge.</i>

509
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:59,951
<i>I know you can feel love</i>
<i>and compassion.</i>

510
00:51:01,254 --> 00:51:05,020
<i>You have a wonderful chance</i>
<i>to show the whole world...</i>

511
00:51:05,225 --> 00:51:08,683
<i>... that you can be merciful,</i>
<i>as well as strong.</i>

512
00:51:08,895 --> 00:51:11,659
<i>That you're big enough</i>
<i>to treat Catherine better...</i>

513
00:51:11,865 --> 00:51:14,026
<i>... than the world has treated you.</i>

514
00:51:14,234 --> 00:51:16,070
<i>You have that power.</i>

515
00:51:16,203 --> 00:51:20,697
<i>Please. My daughter is Catherine.</i>

516
00:51:20,908 --> 00:51:22,967
Boy, that's smart.

517
00:51:23,177 --> 00:51:24,644
Jesus, that's really smart.

518
00:51:24,878 --> 00:51:26,846
She keeps repeating the name.

519
00:51:27,047 --> 00:51:31,609
If he sees Catherine as a person, not
an object, it's harder to tear her up.

520
00:51:31,819 --> 00:51:35,550
<i>Please, release my little girl.</i>

521
00:51:35,823 --> 00:51:39,384
What you're doing, Ms. Starling,
is coming into my hospital...

522
00:51:39,593 --> 00:51:43,154
...and refusing to share information
with me for the third time.

523
00:51:43,464 --> 00:51:47,958
Sir, I told you this is just
a routine follow-up on the Raspail...

524
00:51:48,168 --> 00:51:50,261
He is my patient. I have rights.

525
00:51:50,471 --> 00:51:51,301
I understand that.

526
00:51:51,505 --> 00:51:55,999
Look, I am not just some turnkey,
Miss Starling.

527
00:51:57,077 --> 00:51:59,341
This is the number for
the U.S. Attorney.

528
00:51:59,546 --> 00:52:03,846
Please, either discuss it with him
or let me do my job, you understand?

529
00:52:09,356 --> 00:52:12,519
<i>If your profile helps us catch</i>
<i>Buffalo Bill...</i>

530
00:52:12,726 --> 00:52:15,354
...in time to save Catherine Martin...

531
00:52:15,562 --> 00:52:19,054
...the senator promises you
a transfer to the VA Hospital...

532
00:52:19,266 --> 00:52:22,702
...at Oneida Park, New York,
with a view of the woods nearby.

533
00:52:22,903 --> 00:52:25,633
Maximum security still applies,
of course.

534
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:28,599
You'd have reasonable access to books.

535
00:52:29,476 --> 00:52:30,568
Best of all, though...

536
00:52:31,778 --> 00:52:35,805
...one week of the year, you get
to leave the hospital...

537
00:52:36,016 --> 00:52:38,348
...and go here:

538
00:52:40,921 --> 00:52:42,855
Plum Island.

539
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:46,987
Every day of that week,
you may walk on the beach.

540
00:52:47,194 --> 00:52:50,391
You may swim in the ocean
for up to one hour...

541
00:52:50,597 --> 00:52:53,225
...under SWAT team surveillance,
of course.

542
00:52:54,401 --> 00:52:55,561
And there you have it.

543
00:52:58,338 --> 00:53:02,570
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.

544
00:53:03,544 --> 00:53:05,978
A copy of the senator's offer.

545
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:09,445
This offer is non-negotiable
and final.

546
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:12,675
Catherine Martin dies,
you get nothing.

547
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:27,626
Plum Island Animal Disease
Research Center.

548
00:53:29,336 --> 00:53:30,860
Sounds charming.

549
00:53:31,672 --> 00:53:35,301
That's only part of the island.
There's a very nice beach.

550
00:53:35,509 --> 00:53:37,739
Terns nest there.
There's beautiful...

551
00:53:37,945 --> 00:53:40,072
Terns?

552
00:53:41,048 --> 00:53:44,108
If I help you, Clarice, it will be
"turns" with us too.

553
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:47,412
Quid pro quo. I tell you things,
you tell me things.

554
00:53:47,621 --> 00:53:50,283
Not about this case, though.
About yourself.

555
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:53,459
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?

556
00:53:55,996 --> 00:53:59,488
Yes or no, Clarice? Poor little
Catherine is waiting.

557
00:54:00,701 --> 00:54:02,100
Go, doctor.

558
00:54:03,303 --> 00:54:05,897
What is your worst memory
of childhood?

559
00:54:07,874 --> 00:54:09,535
The death of my father.

560
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:13,470
Tell me about it.
And don't lie, or I'll know.

561
00:54:14,548 --> 00:54:16,675
He was a town marshal...

562
00:54:17,985 --> 00:54:23,252
...and one night he surprised two
burglars coming out of a drugstore.

563
00:54:25,025 --> 00:54:26,458
They shot him.

564
00:54:27,094 --> 00:54:29,289
Was he killed outright?

565
00:54:29,496 --> 00:54:34,092
No, he was very strong.
He lasted more than a month.

566
00:54:34,768 --> 00:54:37,236
My mother died when I was
very young, so...

567
00:54:39,306 --> 00:54:42,400
...my father had become
the whole world to me...

568
00:54:42,609 --> 00:54:45,976
...and when he left me, I had
nothing. I was 10 years old.

569
00:54:46,713 --> 00:54:49,375
You're very frank, Clarice.

570
00:54:49,716 --> 00:54:54,449
I think it would be quite something
to know you in private life.

571
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:58,221
Quid pro quo, doctor.

572
00:54:59,293 --> 00:55:03,821
So tell me about Miss West Virginia.
Was she a large girl?

573
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,430
Yes.

574
00:55:07,634 --> 00:55:10,034
Big through the hips, roomy?

575
00:55:10,237 --> 00:55:11,534
They all were.

576
00:55:12,272 --> 00:55:13,432
What else?

577
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:17,440
She had an object deliberately
inserted into her throat.

578
00:55:17,644 --> 00:55:22,172
Now, that hasn't been made public yet.
We don't know what it means.

579
00:55:22,382 --> 00:55:24,009
Was it a butterfly?

580
00:55:25,419 --> 00:55:28,047
Yes. A moth.

581
00:55:28,689 --> 00:55:33,388
Just like the one we found in
Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.

582
00:55:34,361 --> 00:55:36,192
Why does he place them there,
doctor?

583
00:55:37,297 --> 00:55:40,824
The significance of the moth
is change.

584
00:55:41,034 --> 00:55:44,936
Caterpillar into chrysalis, or pupa...

585
00:55:45,138 --> 00:55:47,800
...and from thence into beauty.

586
00:55:48,008 --> 00:55:50,943
Our Billy wants to change too.

587
00:55:51,712 --> 00:55:54,840
There's no correlation between
transsexualism and violence.

588
00:55:55,048 --> 00:55:57,846
- Transsexuals are very passive.
- Clever girl.

589
00:55:58,518 --> 00:56:01,783
You're so close to the way you're
gonna catch him. Do you realize that?

590
00:56:01,988 --> 00:56:03,956
No. Tell me why.

591
00:56:04,758 --> 00:56:08,524
After your father's murder you were
orphaned. What happened next?

592
00:56:12,432 --> 00:56:16,596
I don't imagine the answer is on
those second-rate shoes, Clarice.

593
00:56:16,803 --> 00:56:20,705
I went to live with my mother's cousin
and her husband in Montana.

594
00:56:20,907 --> 00:56:22,204
They had a ranch.

595
00:56:22,843 --> 00:56:24,208
Was it a cattle ranch?

596
00:56:24,611 --> 00:56:26,306
Sheep and horses.

597
00:56:26,813 --> 00:56:28,110
How long did you live there?

598
00:56:29,316 --> 00:56:30,248
Two months.

599
00:56:30,784 --> 00:56:31,876
Why so briefly?

600
00:56:32,486 --> 00:56:33,544
I ran away.

601
00:56:34,054 --> 00:56:37,922
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher
make you perform fellatio?

602
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:40,093
Did he sodomize you?

603
00:56:40,727 --> 00:56:44,322
No. He was a very decent man.

604
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:48,261
Quid pro quo, doctor.

605
00:56:49,536 --> 00:56:51,902
Billy is not a real transsexual.

606
00:56:52,105 --> 00:56:54,005
But he thinks he is.
He tries to be.

607
00:56:54,207 --> 00:56:57,074
He's tried to be a lot of
things, I expect.

608
00:56:57,277 --> 00:57:01,270
You said I was very close to the way
we'd catch him. What did you mean?

609
00:57:01,481 --> 00:57:04,177
There are three major centers for
transsexual surgery:

610
00:57:04,384 --> 00:57:08,480
Johns Hopkins, the University of
Minnesota, and Columbus Medical Center.

611
00:57:08,688 --> 00:57:11,987
I wouldn't be surprised if Billy
applied for sex reassignment...

612
00:57:12,192 --> 00:57:15,958
...at one or all of them,
and been rejected.

613
00:57:16,163 --> 00:57:17,926
On what basis would they reject him?

614
00:57:18,965 --> 00:57:23,459
Look for severe childhood
disturbances associated with violence.

615
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:26,571
<i>Our Billy wasn't born</i>
<i>a criminal, Clarice...</i>

616
00:57:26,773 --> 00:57:30,766
<i>... he was made one through</i>
<i>years of systematic abuse.</i>

617
00:57:30,977 --> 00:57:34,413
<i>Billy hates his own identity,</i>
<i>you see...</i>

618
00:57:34,614 --> 00:57:37,378
<i>... and he thinks that makes him</i>
<i>a transsexual...</i>

619
00:57:37,584 --> 00:57:41,714
<i>... but his pathology is</i>
<i>a thousand times more savage...</i>

620
00:57:41,922 --> 00:57:43,719
<i>... and more terrifying.</i>

621
00:57:46,959 --> 00:57:51,225
It rubs the lotion on its skin.
It does this whenever it's told.

622
00:57:51,731 --> 00:57:53,494
Mister, my family will pay cash.

623
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,828
Whatever ransom you're asking for,
they'll pay it.

624
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:02,507
It rubs the lotion on its skin
or else it gets the hose again.

625
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:06,578
Yes, she will, Precious.
She'll get the hose.

626
00:58:07,647 --> 00:58:10,411
Okay, okay, okay.

627
00:58:11,451 --> 00:58:13,282
Okay, I'll do it.

628
00:58:13,486 --> 00:58:14,953
Okay.

629
00:58:16,122 --> 00:58:21,458
Mister, if you let me go,
I won't press charges. I promise.

630
00:58:22,462 --> 00:58:24,953
See, my mom is a real important woman.

631
00:58:25,164 --> 00:58:27,155
I guess you already know that.

632
00:58:27,367 --> 00:58:30,359
Now it places the lotion
in the basket.

633
00:58:30,803 --> 00:58:31,827
Please!

634
00:58:32,739 --> 00:58:34,798
Please, I want to go home.

635
00:58:35,608 --> 00:58:38,702
I want to go home!
Please! Please let me.

636
00:58:38,911 --> 00:58:41,345
It places the lotion in the basket.

637
00:58:42,215 --> 00:58:46,345
I want to see my mommy.
Please let me.

638
00:58:47,086 --> 00:58:50,852
I want to see my mom again.
I want...

639
00:58:51,057 --> 00:58:53,548
I want to see my mom.

640
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,794
Put the fucking lotion in the basket!

641
00:59:32,698 --> 00:59:36,657
You still think you're gonna walk
on some beach and see the birdies?

642
00:59:36,869 --> 00:59:38,632
I don't think so.

643
00:59:39,705 --> 00:59:41,900
I called Senator Ruth Martin.

644
00:59:42,108 --> 00:59:44,872
She never heard of any deal with you.

645
00:59:45,678 --> 00:59:48,272
They scammed you, Hannibal.

646
00:59:49,715 --> 00:59:51,273
Stand outside.

647
00:59:52,652 --> 00:59:54,244
And shut the door.

648
00:59:54,554 --> 00:59:55,851
Barney.

649
01:00:01,961 --> 01:00:06,227
There never was a deal with
Senator Martin, but there is now.

650
01:00:06,432 --> 01:00:07,660
I designed it.

651
01:00:07,867 --> 01:00:11,633
Of course, I worked in a few
conditions for my own benefit as well.

652
01:00:11,838 --> 01:00:14,898
Identify Buffalo Bill by name...

653
01:00:15,107 --> 01:00:17,166
...and if the girl is found in time...

654
01:00:17,376 --> 01:00:21,642
...you'll be transferred to Brushy
Mountain State Prison in Tennessee.

655
01:00:22,715 --> 01:00:24,580
Answer me, Hannibal.

656
01:00:26,552 --> 01:00:28,144
You answer me now...

657
01:00:28,354 --> 01:00:31,221
...or, by God,
you'll never leave this cell.

658
01:00:33,192 --> 01:00:35,422
Who is Buffalo Bill?

659
01:00:36,295 --> 01:00:38,456
His first name is Louis.

660
01:00:38,898 --> 01:00:42,459
I'll tell the rest to the Senator
herself, but only in Tennessee.

661
01:00:42,668 --> 01:00:45,136
And I have a few conditions of my own.

662
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:49,833
Clean him up and get him ready to go.

663
01:00:50,877 --> 01:00:54,074
<i>Jack, Hannibal Lecter</i>
<i>is being transferred to Memphis.</i>

664
01:00:54,313 --> 01:00:55,541
Transferred?

665
01:00:55,748 --> 01:01:00,242
Did you have a trainee make a phony
offer to Lecter in the senator's name?

666
01:01:00,453 --> 01:01:02,284
I rolled the dice. I had to.

667
01:01:02,488 --> 01:01:04,513
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.

668
01:01:04,724 --> 01:01:06,658
Paul Krendler's here from Justice.

669
01:01:06,859 --> 01:01:09,692
She's asking him
to take over in Memphis.

670
01:01:34,287 --> 01:01:36,152
Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter.

671
01:01:36,355 --> 01:01:38,983
I'm Lieutenant Boyle.
This is Sergeant Patrick.

672
01:01:39,191 --> 01:01:41,284
We'll treat you as good
as you treat us.

673
01:01:41,494 --> 01:01:44,588
You be a gentleman,
you'll get three hots and a cot.

674
01:01:45,631 --> 01:01:49,499
Sir, if you sign right here,
we'll have us a legal transfer.

675
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,535
Here, sir, use mine.

676
01:02:43,723 --> 01:02:44,712
Senator Martin...

677
01:02:46,058 --> 01:02:48,185
...Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

678
01:02:52,932 --> 01:02:54,524
Dr. Lecter...

679
01:02:55,001 --> 01:02:58,459
...I've brought an affidavit
guaranteeing your new rights.

680
01:02:58,738 --> 01:03:01,229
You'll want to read it before I sign.

681
01:03:04,877 --> 01:03:09,109
I won't waste your time or Catherine's
time bargaining for petty privileges.

682
01:03:09,315 --> 01:03:13,217
Clarice Starling and Jack Crawford
have wasted too much time already.

683
01:03:13,719 --> 01:03:16,745
I only pray they haven't doomed
the poor girl.

684
01:03:17,823 --> 01:03:21,088
Let me help you now.
I will trust you when it is all over.

685
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,585
You have my word. Paul.

686
01:03:26,332 --> 01:03:28,800
Buffalo Bill's real name
is Louis Friend.

687
01:03:30,136 --> 01:03:34,095
I met him just once. He was referred
to me in April or May, 1980...

688
01:03:34,306 --> 01:03:36,968
...by my patient Benjamin Raspail.

689
01:03:37,176 --> 01:03:39,110
They were lovers, you see.

690
01:03:39,478 --> 01:03:43,437
But Raspail had become
very frightened.

691
01:03:43,649 --> 01:03:47,085
Apparently, Louis had
murdered a transient...

692
01:03:47,286 --> 01:03:49,069
...and done things with the skin.

693
01:03:49,104 --> 01:03:50,853
...and done things with the skin.

694
01:03:51,758 --> 01:03:54,249
We need his address
and a physical description.

695
01:03:55,561 --> 01:03:57,392
Tell me, senator.

696
01:03:57,864 --> 01:04:00,298
Did you nurse Catherine yourself?

697
01:04:00,733 --> 01:04:03,361
- What?
- Did you breast-feed her?

698
01:04:03,569 --> 01:04:05,935
- Now, wait a minute!
- Yes. I did.

699
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:08,332
Toughened your nipples, didn't it?

700
01:04:08,541 --> 01:04:09,530
You son of a bitch!

701
01:04:10,043 --> 01:04:13,843
Amputate a man's leg,
and he can still feel it tickling.

702
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:17,379
Tell me, Mom, when your
little girl is on the slab...

703
01:04:17,583 --> 01:04:19,050
...where will it tickle you?

704
01:04:19,986 --> 01:04:23,319
Take this thing back to Baltimore.

705
01:04:24,323 --> 01:04:27,292
Five-foot-ten, strongly built,
about 180 pounds.

706
01:04:27,493 --> 01:04:30,053
Hair, blond. Eyes, pale blue.

707
01:04:30,263 --> 01:04:31,491
He'd be about 35 now.

708
01:04:31,697 --> 01:04:34,598
He said he lived in Philadelphia
but may have lied.

709
01:04:34,801 --> 01:04:36,530
That's all I can remember, Mom.

710
01:04:36,736 --> 01:04:39,398
But if I think of any more,
I will let you know.

711
01:04:41,874 --> 01:04:44,308
Oh, and senator, just one more thing:

712
01:04:46,679 --> 01:04:48,476
Love your suit.

713
01:04:50,616 --> 01:04:53,585
<i>In a meeting earlier today</i>
<i>with Senator Ruth Martin...</i>

714
01:04:53,786 --> 01:04:58,018
...Dr. Lecter agreed to help in the
investigation to find Buffalo Bill.

715
01:05:00,426 --> 01:05:02,394
- How do you fit in?
- My unique insight...

716
01:05:02,595 --> 01:05:04,529
...into Lecter made the breakthrough.

717
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:05,788
Buffalo Bill's name?

718
01:05:05,998 --> 01:05:09,764
His name is now a matter of record
with the proper authorities.

719
01:05:09,969 --> 01:05:12,437
- Can you give us..?
- I'm Dr. Frederick Chilton.

720
01:05:12,638 --> 01:05:14,196
- Spell it?
- That's C-H...

721
01:05:15,875 --> 01:05:17,866
Are you with Dr. Chilton's group?

722
01:05:18,077 --> 01:05:20,568
Well, I just saw him outside, sir.

723
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:24,045
Access to Lecter is limited.
We've received death threats.

724
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:25,842
I understand, sir.

725
01:05:31,958 --> 01:05:33,585
Log in and check your weapon.

726
01:05:35,027 --> 01:05:37,257
I can't take all the credit myself.

727
01:05:37,463 --> 01:05:39,761
Senator Martin,
Justice Department, FBI...

728
01:05:39,966 --> 01:05:43,402
...folks at the Baltimore State
Hospital. Now for the hard part:

729
01:05:43,603 --> 01:05:45,400
Apprehending the suspect.

730
01:05:45,905 --> 01:05:47,964
Excuse me, I have to catch a flight.

731
01:05:52,211 --> 01:05:54,406
Command desk, Officer Jacobs.

732
01:06:03,356 --> 01:06:06,416
- Is it true what they're saying?
- Huh?

733
01:06:07,426 --> 01:06:09,451
He's some kind of vampire?

734
01:06:11,731 --> 01:06:13,926
They don't have a name for what he is.

735
01:06:15,034 --> 01:06:16,729
You do know the rules, ma'am?

736
01:06:17,436 --> 01:06:19,768
Yes, I've questioned him before.

737
01:06:23,276 --> 01:06:24,265
Go ahead.

738
01:07:01,781 --> 01:07:03,749
Good evening, Clarice.

739
01:07:05,318 --> 01:07:08,014
I thought you might like
your drawings back.

740
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:12,681
Just until you get your view.

741
01:07:13,426 --> 01:07:15,656
How very thoughtful.

742
01:07:16,596 --> 01:07:19,394
Or did Jack Crawford
send you for one last wheedle...

743
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:21,829
...before you're both
booted off the case?

744
01:07:22,335 --> 01:07:24,530
No. I came because I wanted to.

745
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:31,642
People will say we're in love.

746
01:07:35,781 --> 01:07:38,272
Anthrax Island.

747
01:07:38,484 --> 01:07:41,453
That was an especially
nice touch, Clarice.

748
01:07:41,654 --> 01:07:42,643
Yours?

749
01:07:43,356 --> 01:07:44,380
Yes.

750
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:46,148
Yeah.

751
01:07:46,792 --> 01:07:48,589
That was good.

752
01:07:48,794 --> 01:07:50,728
Pity about poor Catherine, though.

753
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:52,955
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

754
01:07:53,165 --> 01:07:55,963
Your anagrams are showing, doctor.

755
01:07:56,802 --> 01:07:58,326
Louis Friend?

756
01:07:59,038 --> 01:08:02,235
Iron sulfide,
also known as fool's gold.

757
01:08:02,675 --> 01:08:06,577
Oh, Clarice, your problem is, you
need to get more fun out of life.

758
01:08:07,046 --> 01:08:10,015
You were telling me the truth
back in Baltimore, sir.

759
01:08:10,216 --> 01:08:11,683
Please continue now.

760
01:08:12,285 --> 01:08:14,776
Well, I've read the case files.
Have you?

761
01:08:15,154 --> 01:08:18,214
Everything you need to find him
is there in those pages.

762
01:08:18,424 --> 01:08:21,325
- Then tell me how.
- First principles, Clarice.

763
01:08:21,527 --> 01:08:24,621
Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius.

764
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:28,288
Of each particular thing, ask:
What is it in itself?

765
01:08:28,501 --> 01:08:30,298
What is its nature?

766
01:08:30,736 --> 01:08:34,638
What does he do, this man you seek?

767
01:08:36,142 --> 01:08:37,370
He kills women.

768
01:08:37,576 --> 01:08:40,545
No. That is incidental.

769
01:08:41,547 --> 01:08:46,644
What is the principle thing he does?
What needs does he serve by killing?

770
01:08:47,186 --> 01:08:48,414
Anger...

771
01:08:50,056 --> 01:08:54,083
...social acceptance
and sexual frustration...

772
01:08:54,293 --> 01:08:55,282
No!

773
01:08:55,861 --> 01:08:57,886
He covets.

774
01:08:58,764 --> 01:09:00,322
That is his nature.

775
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:03,165
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?

776
01:09:03,936 --> 01:09:06,564
Do we seek out things to covet?

777
01:09:07,173 --> 01:09:09,073
Make an effort to answer now.

778
01:09:09,275 --> 01:09:11,743
No, we just...

779
01:09:11,944 --> 01:09:15,277
No, we begin by coveting
what we see every day.

780
01:09:15,481 --> 01:09:18,780
Don't you feel eyes moving
over your body, Clarice?

781
01:09:19,518 --> 01:09:22,919
And don't your eyes seek out
the things you want?

782
01:09:23,622 --> 01:09:25,954
All right, yes.
Now, please tell me how.

783
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:27,625
No.

784
01:09:28,361 --> 01:09:30,329
It is your turn to tell me, Clarice.

785
01:09:30,529 --> 01:09:32,997
You don't have any more
vacations to sell.

786
01:09:33,666 --> 01:09:36,157
Why did you leave that ranch?

787
01:09:36,469 --> 01:09:40,496
Doctor, we don't have any more time
for any of this now.

788
01:09:40,706 --> 01:09:43,231
But we don't reckon time
the same way, do we?

789
01:09:43,442 --> 01:09:45,307
This is all the time you'll have.

790
01:09:45,511 --> 01:09:47,809
Later. Please listen.
We've only got five...

791
01:09:48,013 --> 01:09:51,384
No! I will listen now.

792
01:09:53,486 --> 01:09:56,455
Your father's murder orphaned you
when you were 10.

793
01:09:56,655 --> 01:10:01,490
You went to live with cousins on a
sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And?

794
01:10:03,763 --> 01:10:05,958
And one morning I just ran away.

795
01:10:06,732 --> 01:10:10,224
Not "just," Clarice.
What set you off?

796
01:10:10,436 --> 01:10:12,028
You started at what time?

797
01:10:12,772 --> 01:10:14,069
Early, still dark.

798
01:10:14,273 --> 01:10:16,867
Then something woke you.
Was it a dream?

799
01:10:17,076 --> 01:10:18,168
What was it?

800
01:10:19,712 --> 01:10:21,475
I heard a strange noise.

801
01:10:22,715 --> 01:10:24,080
What was it?

802
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:25,912
It was...

803
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:28,609
...screaming.

804
01:10:30,189 --> 01:10:32,885
Some kind of screaming,
like a child's voice.

805
01:10:33,459 --> 01:10:34,926
What did you do?

806
01:10:35,461 --> 01:10:36,792
I went...

807
01:10:36,996 --> 01:10:39,692
...downstairs. Outside.

808
01:10:41,834 --> 01:10:44,428
I crept up into the barn.

809
01:10:44,637 --> 01:10:47,834
I was so scared to look inside,
but I had to.

810
01:10:48,974 --> 01:10:52,273
And what did you see, Clarice?
What did you see?

811
01:10:53,712 --> 01:10:55,009
Lambs.

812
01:10:56,215 --> 01:10:57,876
They were screaming.

813
01:10:58,451 --> 01:11:01,215
They were slaughtering
the spring lambs?

814
01:11:01,754 --> 01:11:03,483
And they were screaming.

815
01:11:04,824 --> 01:11:06,519
And you ran away?

816
01:11:06,725 --> 01:11:10,559
No. First I tried to free them.

817
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:13,664
I opened the gate to their pen.

818
01:11:13,866 --> 01:11:17,302
They just stood there, confused.
They wouldn't run.

819
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:19,994
But you could and you did, didn't you?

820
01:11:20,806 --> 01:11:24,207
Yes. I took one lamb
and I ran away as fast as I could.

821
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:26,207
Where were you going, Clarice?

822
01:11:26,412 --> 01:11:29,404
I don't know. I didn't have
any food, any water...

823
01:11:29,615 --> 01:11:32,243
...and it was very cold.
It was very cold.

824
01:11:34,453 --> 01:11:35,579
I thought...

825
01:11:36,489 --> 01:11:39,049
I thought if I could save just one...

826
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:42,652
...but he was so heavy.

827
01:11:43,762 --> 01:11:45,252
He was so heavy.

828
01:11:50,569 --> 01:11:54,505
I didn't get more than a few miles
when the sheriff's car picked me up.

829
01:11:57,676 --> 01:12:01,874
The rancher was so angry he sent me
to a Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman.

830
01:12:02,715 --> 01:12:04,706
I never saw the ranch again.

831
01:12:05,417 --> 01:12:08,147
What became of your lamb, Clarice?

832
01:12:10,089 --> 01:12:11,386
They killed him.

833
01:12:11,757 --> 01:12:13,952
You still wake up sometimes,
don't you?

834
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:15,955
Wake up in the dark...

835
01:12:16,629 --> 01:12:19,462
...and hear the screaming
of the lambs?

836
01:12:20,065 --> 01:12:21,157
Yes.

837
01:12:22,668 --> 01:12:25,466
And you think if you save
poor Catherine...

838
01:12:25,671 --> 01:12:29,232
...you can make them stop, don't you?
You think if Catherine lives...

839
01:12:29,441 --> 01:12:32,638
...you won't wake up
in the dark ever again...

840
01:12:32,845 --> 01:12:35,712
...to that awful screaming
of the lambs.

841
01:12:36,882 --> 01:12:38,247
I don't know.

842
01:12:38,984 --> 01:12:40,315
I don't know.

843
01:12:42,021 --> 01:12:44,421
Thank you, Clarice.

844
01:12:44,623 --> 01:12:46,181
Thank you.

845
01:12:46,492 --> 01:12:48,483
Tell me his name, doctor.

846
01:12:55,434 --> 01:12:57,698
Dr. Chilton, I presume.

847
01:12:58,304 --> 01:12:59,862
I think you know each other.

848
01:13:02,107 --> 01:13:03,631
Okay.

849
01:13:04,276 --> 01:13:06,403
- We found her.
- Let's go.

850
01:13:06,612 --> 01:13:08,375
It's your turn, doctor.

851
01:13:08,781 --> 01:13:10,442
- Out!
- Tell me his name.

852
01:13:10,649 --> 01:13:13,482
Sorry, ma'am, I've got orders
to put you on a plane.

853
01:13:13,686 --> 01:13:14,846
Come on, now.

854
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,088
Brave Clarice.

855
01:13:17,423 --> 01:13:20,984
You will let me know when those lambs
stop screaming, won't you?

856
01:13:21,193 --> 01:13:23,024
Tell me his name, doctor!

857
01:13:23,228 --> 01:13:24,525
Clarice!

858
01:13:25,898 --> 01:13:27,661
Your case file.

859
01:13:29,335 --> 01:13:30,427
Hey!

860
01:13:32,605 --> 01:13:34,095
Goodbye, Clarice.

861
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:42,002
Ready when you are, doc.

862
01:14:42,408 --> 01:14:44,501
Just another minute, please.

863
01:14:53,352 --> 01:14:55,786
Son of a bitch demanded
a second dinner.

864
01:14:55,988 --> 01:14:57,819
Lamb chops, extra rare.

865
01:14:58,023 --> 01:15:02,619
Wonder what he wants for breakfast?
Some damn thing from the zoo?

866
01:15:24,183 --> 01:15:25,650
Good evening, gentlemen.

867
01:15:26,118 --> 01:15:27,813
Okay, doc. Grab some floor.

868
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:30,079
Same drill as before, please.

869
01:15:36,929 --> 01:15:39,227
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

870
01:15:55,814 --> 01:15:56,940
Okay.

871
01:16:03,789 --> 01:16:05,256
Hand me that, would you?

872
01:16:10,996 --> 01:16:12,156
Thanks.

873
01:16:16,067 --> 01:16:18,058
Mind the drawings, please.

874
01:16:21,306 --> 01:16:22,330
Thank you.

875
01:16:46,898 --> 01:16:49,492
Pembry, watch it, he's cuffed me!

876
01:16:56,141 --> 01:16:57,574
Jesus Christ!

877
01:18:16,354 --> 01:18:18,788
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

878
01:18:28,233 --> 01:18:30,167
What is this shit?

879
01:18:32,637 --> 01:18:34,332
Did somebody go up on five?

880
01:18:34,539 --> 01:18:38,339
- No, nobody went up.
- Call Pembry. Ask him to tell...

881
01:18:41,246 --> 01:18:45,307
CP, shots fired on five.
Repeat, shots fired on five.

882
01:18:45,517 --> 01:18:46,848
Sergeant Tate!

883
01:18:47,452 --> 01:18:49,079
<i>Proceed. Shots fired on five.</i>

884
01:18:49,654 --> 01:18:51,315
Holy shit!

885
01:18:51,523 --> 01:18:53,320
- What the hell?
- Bitch!

886
01:18:53,692 --> 01:18:54,681
Shut up!

887
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,120
Bobby, get the vest.

888
01:18:56,328 --> 01:18:57,795
Right, sarge.

889
01:18:58,129 --> 01:19:00,290
- Brady, Howard, cover...
- Look!

890
01:19:03,134 --> 01:19:04,658
It stopped.

891
01:19:05,937 --> 01:19:07,598
Seal off a 10-block radius.

892
01:19:07,806 --> 01:19:10,775
Get me the SWAT team
and an ambulance, double quick.

893
01:19:10,976 --> 01:19:12,136
We're going up.

894
01:19:41,139 --> 01:19:42,663
Pembry?!

895
01:19:44,109 --> 01:19:45,599
Boyle?!

896
01:19:58,590 --> 01:19:59,955
Oh, God!

897
01:20:07,098 --> 01:20:08,156
Go.

898
01:20:15,974 --> 01:20:17,373
- Clear.
- Clear.

899
01:20:17,575 --> 01:20:18,974
Command post.

900
01:20:19,411 --> 01:20:20,935
Two officers down.

901
01:20:21,146 --> 01:20:22,636
- Clear!
- Clear!

902
01:20:23,081 --> 01:20:24,275
Lecter's gone, sarge.

903
01:20:24,482 --> 01:20:26,279
Prisoner is missing.

904
01:20:26,484 --> 01:20:27,951
Boyle's gun is gone.

905
01:20:28,286 --> 01:20:30,754
Repeat. Lecter is missing and armed.

906
01:20:30,955 --> 01:20:32,752
He stripped the bed.

907
01:20:33,191 --> 01:20:35,955
Might be making a rope.
Check all the windows.

908
01:20:36,161 --> 01:20:38,459
Where the fuck is my ambulance?

909
01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:40,420
He's alive.

910
01:20:41,032 --> 01:20:43,296
Sergeant Tate! He's alive!

911
01:20:43,668 --> 01:20:46,865
Get ahold of him and feel his hands.
Talk to him!

912
01:20:47,372 --> 01:20:48,396
What do I say?

913
01:20:48,606 --> 01:20:51,541
It's Jim Pembry.
Now talk to him, damn it!

914
01:20:52,444 --> 01:20:54,708
Lecter is missing and armed.

915
01:20:54,913 --> 01:20:58,747
- Pembry. Pembry, can you hear me?
- He took Boyle's gun.

916
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:01,976
Pembry got off one round.
There's a chance Lecter's hit.

917
01:21:02,187 --> 01:21:04,121
Keep breathing in and out.

918
01:21:04,322 --> 01:21:07,883
You're doing a good job.
You look real good there.

919
01:21:08,526 --> 01:21:11,427
Yeah, you look... Look real good.

920
01:21:28,413 --> 01:21:29,573
- You ready?
- Let's go!

921
01:21:29,781 --> 01:21:31,772
- Let's do it.
- Okay, let's go!

922
01:21:42,694 --> 01:21:44,821
Looking good. You're gonna make it.

923
01:21:45,029 --> 01:21:47,020
Everything's just fine.

924
01:21:47,232 --> 01:21:49,462
- I need that IV now!
- Lactated Ringer's.

925
01:21:49,667 --> 01:21:52,033
Can we get the strap?
Where's the oxygen?

926
01:21:52,237 --> 01:21:55,968
Doing good, buddy. That's right.
Stay with me here.

927
01:21:57,308 --> 01:22:00,072
We're losing him!
Downstairs, quickly!

928
01:22:00,411 --> 01:22:01,878
And up!

929
01:22:03,114 --> 01:22:04,172
- Elevator!
- This way!

930
01:22:04,382 --> 01:22:07,044
- Out of the way!
- Get out of the way!

931
01:22:10,822 --> 01:22:12,380
<i>CP to Tate.</i>

932
01:22:12,590 --> 01:22:15,457
Roger, lieutenant. Tate here.

933
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:18,288
I'm on the elevator
bringing Pembry down.

934
01:22:18,763 --> 01:22:20,731
He seems to be hanging on.

935
01:22:21,432 --> 01:22:23,525
Top three floors secured.

936
01:22:24,068 --> 01:22:26,127
Main stairwell secured.

937
01:22:27,105 --> 01:22:29,005
We think he's on two.

938
01:22:42,253 --> 01:22:44,448
<i>Tate, you still with me?</i>

939
01:22:46,090 --> 01:22:48,524
We're pretty sure
he's somewhere on two, sir.

940
01:22:48,726 --> 01:22:51,663
That's all for now. Over.

941
01:23:10,148 --> 01:23:12,708
He's on the roof of the elevator.

942
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:16,751
Okay, guys.

943
01:23:33,371 --> 01:23:34,360
I see him.

944
01:23:34,839 --> 01:23:37,205
There's a gun by his hand.
He's not moving.

945
01:23:38,042 --> 01:23:40,840
- One warning. We need him alive.
<i>- Got it.</i>

946
01:23:41,946 --> 01:23:43,174
Lecter?

947
01:23:43,481 --> 01:23:45,415
Put your hands on your head.

948
01:23:47,785 --> 01:23:49,252
One in the leg.

949
01:24:00,331 --> 01:24:01,855
No movement.

950
01:24:03,067 --> 01:24:05,763
Johnny, hold your fire.
We're coming into the car.

951
01:24:06,237 --> 01:24:07,864
We're opening the hatch.

952
01:24:08,706 --> 01:24:09,695
Watch his hands.

953
01:24:09,907 --> 01:24:12,842
If there's any fire,
it'll come from us. Affirm.

954
01:24:13,044 --> 01:24:14,102
<i>Got it.</i>

955
01:24:40,238 --> 01:24:42,172
Memphis General, this is Unit 26.

956
01:24:42,373 --> 01:24:44,933
We're inbound with
a 50-year-old male officer...

957
01:24:45,143 --> 01:24:47,270
...with severe facial lacerations.

958
01:24:47,478 --> 01:24:50,606
He had grand mal seizure activity.
He's postdictal now.

959
01:24:50,815 --> 01:24:52,976
<i>- I copy.</i>
<i>- Vital signs are good.</i>

960
01:24:53,184 --> 01:24:54,845
- Pressure is 130/90.
- Ninety?

961
01:24:55,052 --> 01:24:57,213
Yeah, that's right, 90. Pulse, 84.

962
01:24:57,488 --> 01:24:59,786
We got him
on lactated Ringer's running...

963
01:24:59,991 --> 01:25:02,289
...and the patient
is on 10 liters of oxygen.

964
01:25:03,427 --> 01:25:04,587
Watch it!

965
01:25:08,933 --> 01:25:12,334
The ambulance was found in
a parking garage at Memphis Airport.

966
01:25:12,537 --> 01:25:14,004
The crew was dead.

967
01:25:15,072 --> 01:25:16,699
He killed a tourist too.

968
01:25:16,908 --> 01:25:18,773
Got his clothes, cash.

969
01:25:19,177 --> 01:25:20,974
By now he could be anywhere.

970
01:25:21,179 --> 01:25:23,170
- He won't come after me.
- Oh, really?

971
01:25:23,381 --> 01:25:24,507
He won't.

972
01:25:24,982 --> 01:25:26,745
I can't explain it.

973
01:25:26,951 --> 01:25:29,181
He would consider that rude.

974
01:25:29,654 --> 01:25:31,485
It's over. She's dead.

975
01:25:31,689 --> 01:25:33,316
It's not your fault.

976
01:25:33,524 --> 01:25:38,154
Lecter said everything we need to
catch him with is here, only I can't...

977
01:25:38,362 --> 01:25:40,159
Dr. Lecter said a lot of things.

978
01:25:40,898 --> 01:25:42,126
He's here, Ardelia.

979
01:26:11,762 --> 01:26:13,730
Is this Lecter's handwriting?

980
01:26:15,766 --> 01:26:20,135
"Doesn't this random scattering
of sites seem desperately random?

981
01:26:20,338 --> 01:26:24,138
Like the elaboration of a bad liar?
Ta. Hannibal Lecter."

982
01:26:24,342 --> 01:26:27,334
"Desperately random."
What does he mean?

983
01:26:27,545 --> 01:26:30,446
Not random at all, maybe.
Like there's a pattern here.

984
01:26:31,549 --> 01:26:34,780
But there's no pattern
or the computers would've nailed it.

985
01:26:34,986 --> 01:26:37,420
They're even found in random order.

986
01:26:37,622 --> 01:26:41,456
Random because of the one girl.
The one he weighted down.

987
01:26:41,893 --> 01:26:43,793
- Fredrica Bimmel.
- Right.

988
01:26:43,995 --> 01:26:47,328
From Belvedere, Ohio.

989
01:26:47,531 --> 01:26:51,092
The first girl taken,
third body found. Why?

990
01:26:51,302 --> 01:26:53,429
She didn't drift.
He weighted her down.

991
01:26:53,638 --> 01:26:56,971
What did Lecter say
about the "first principles"?

992
01:26:57,174 --> 01:26:58,732
Simplicity.

993
01:26:58,943 --> 01:27:02,208
What does this guy do? He covets.

994
01:27:02,413 --> 01:27:04,904
How do we first start to covet?

995
01:27:05,116 --> 01:27:06,811
We covet what we see.

996
01:27:07,018 --> 01:27:08,645
Every day.

997
01:27:10,655 --> 01:27:11,883
Hot damn, Clarice.

998
01:27:12,356 --> 01:27:13,618
He knew her.

999
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,399
Mr. Bimmel?

1000
01:28:30,601 --> 01:28:31,829
That's me.

1001
01:28:32,169 --> 01:28:34,831
Hello, I'm Clarice Starling.
I'm with the FBI.

1002
01:28:38,743 --> 01:28:42,008
I appreciate you letting me
take a look around, Mr. Bimmel.

1003
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,607
I don't know nothing new to tell you.

1004
01:28:44,815 --> 01:28:47,750
Police been back here
so many times already.

1005
01:28:48,419 --> 01:28:52,223
Fredrica went into Chicago
on the bus to see about a job.

1006
01:28:52,623 --> 01:28:54,318
She left the interview okay.

1007
01:28:54,658 --> 01:28:56,250
She never come home.

1008
01:28:59,096 --> 01:29:01,257
Her bedroom's how she left it.

1009
01:29:01,699 --> 01:29:02,688
Upstairs.

1010
01:29:03,367 --> 01:29:04,857
<i>Door to the left.</i>

1011
01:31:49,867 --> 01:31:53,496
<i>He's making himself a woman suit.</i>
<i>Out of real women!</i>

1012
01:31:53,704 --> 01:31:54,762
And he can sew!

1013
01:31:54,972 --> 01:31:57,964
He's very skilled.
He's a tailor or a dressmaker or...

1014
01:31:58,175 --> 01:31:59,938
<i>- Starling!</i>
- That's why they're big.

1015
01:32:00,144 --> 01:32:02,374
He keeps them alive
so he can starve them...

1016
01:32:02,579 --> 01:32:04,012
...loosen their skin and...

1017
01:32:04,214 --> 01:32:06,739
<i>Starling!</i>
<i>We know who and where he is!</i>

1018
01:32:06,950 --> 01:32:08,440
<i>We're on our way right now.</i>

1019
01:32:08,652 --> 01:32:11,553
<i>- Where?</i>
- Calumet City, edge of Chicago.

1020
01:32:11,755 --> 01:32:14,315
Be on the ground
in 45 minutes with HRT.

1021
01:32:14,525 --> 01:32:16,720
That's great news, sir. But how..?

1022
01:32:16,927 --> 01:32:20,488
<i>We fed the names Johns Hopkins</i>
<i>came up with into Known Offenders.</i>

1023
01:32:20,697 --> 01:32:24,633
Subject's name is Jamie Gumb,
a.k.a. John Grant.

1024
01:32:24,835 --> 01:32:28,532
<i>Lecter's description was accurate.</i>
<i>He just lied about the name.</i>

1025
01:32:28,739 --> 01:32:30,832
Customs had some paper on him.

1026
01:32:31,041 --> 01:32:34,101
They stopped a carton
two years ago at LAX.

1027
01:32:34,311 --> 01:32:36,370
Live caterpillars from Suriname.

1028
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:39,572
The addressee was a Jame Gumb.

1029
01:32:40,150 --> 01:32:43,051
Chicago is only 400 miles from here.
I'll be there in...

1030
01:32:43,253 --> 01:32:44,948
No, there's not enough time.

1031
01:32:45,155 --> 01:32:47,350
We want him for murder,
not kidnapping.

1032
01:32:47,558 --> 01:32:49,822
Link him to Bimmel
before he's indicted.

1033
01:32:50,027 --> 01:32:54,054
- See what you can find in Belvedere.
- Yes, sir. You bet. I'll do my best.

1034
01:32:54,264 --> 01:32:55,595
<i>Starling.</i>

1035
01:32:55,999 --> 01:32:59,594
We wouldn't have found him
without you. Nobody will forget that.

1036
01:33:00,270 --> 01:33:01,862
<i>Least of all me.</i>

1037
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:04,100
Thank you, sir.

1038
01:33:04,308 --> 01:33:06,640
Thank you very much, Mr. Crawford.

1039
01:33:07,911 --> 01:33:09,344
Mr. Crawford?

1040
01:33:21,859 --> 01:33:24,157
Thanks for the scraps, asshole.

1041
01:33:24,461 --> 01:33:26,395
I got a better idea.

1042
01:33:47,751 --> 01:33:50,379
Okay, Precious.
Time for a little treat.

1043
01:34:03,333 --> 01:34:04,823
Precious!

1044
01:34:07,170 --> 01:34:08,933
Come on, girl!

1045
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:12,465
Come on, Precious. Come on, Precious.

1046
01:34:21,718 --> 01:34:23,447
Come on, Precious.

1047
01:34:23,654 --> 01:34:26,521
I got a yummy, yummy snack for you.

1048
01:34:26,723 --> 01:34:27,985
Come and get it!

1049
01:34:34,998 --> 01:34:36,431
Precious!

1050
01:34:37,234 --> 01:34:39,964
Are you up there, you little shit?

1051
01:34:40,504 --> 01:34:43,373
Come and get it, pretty girl.

1052
01:34:49,812 --> 01:34:51,177
Precious!

1053
01:34:51,381 --> 01:34:53,542
Please come. Come on.

1054
01:35:01,357 --> 01:35:03,325
Come on, Precious.

1055
01:35:15,204 --> 01:35:16,694
Would you fuck me?

1056
01:35:17,140 --> 01:35:20,109
Come on. Take that bone. Come on.

1057
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:23,574
Come on. Come on! Come on!

1058
01:35:24,046 --> 01:35:25,240
I'd fuck me.

1059
01:35:26,048 --> 01:35:27,037
Come on.

1060
01:35:31,354 --> 01:35:35,950
I'd fuck me hard.
I'd fuck me so hard.

1061
01:35:40,129 --> 01:35:41,391
No!

1062
01:36:42,391 --> 01:36:46,293
Is that a good job, FBI agent?
You get to travel around and stuff?

1063
01:36:46,496 --> 01:36:48,657
I mean, better places than this?

1064
01:36:50,466 --> 01:36:52,024
Sometimes you do.

1065
01:36:52,902 --> 01:36:57,236
Freddie was so happy for me
when I got this job at the bank.

1066
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:01,376
Toaster giveaways and Barry Manilow
on the speakers all day.

1067
01:37:01,577 --> 01:37:04,137
She thought it was such hot shit.

1068
01:37:04,547 --> 01:37:06,845
What did she know? Big dummy.

1069
01:37:07,049 --> 01:37:11,213
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention
a man named Jamie Gumb?

1070
01:37:11,420 --> 01:37:13,081
Or a Jame Gumb?

1071
01:37:13,856 --> 01:37:16,120
- How about John Grant?
- No.

1072
01:37:16,325 --> 01:37:18,657
Would she have had a friend
you didn't know?

1073
01:37:18,861 --> 01:37:21,421
No way. If she had a guy,
I'd have known.

1074
01:37:21,631 --> 01:37:23,189
Sewing was her life.

1075
01:37:23,933 --> 01:37:25,491
Did you ever work together?

1076
01:37:25,701 --> 01:37:30,434
Me and Pam Malavesi used to help her
do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman.

1077
01:37:30,973 --> 01:37:34,534
Can I get Mrs. Lippman's address?
I need to talk to her.

1078
01:38:02,638 --> 01:38:04,401
So powerful.

1079
01:38:04,607 --> 01:38:06,234
So beautiful.

1080
01:38:11,347 --> 01:38:12,780
Precious?

1081
01:38:18,588 --> 01:38:19,577
Precious?

1082
01:38:19,789 --> 01:38:21,814
Down here, you sack of shit!

1083
01:38:30,499 --> 01:38:32,023
- Put her in that bucket.
- No!

1084
01:38:32,234 --> 01:38:35,101
You get me a telephone
and lower it down here, now!

1085
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:42,199
Oh, poodlie-poo. Precious?
Darling, are you all right?

1086
01:38:42,411 --> 01:38:45,403
She's in a lot of pain, mister.
She needs a vet.

1087
01:38:49,752 --> 01:38:52,380
She broke her leg on the way down.
She's licking...

1088
01:38:52,588 --> 01:38:54,579
Hey! Don't you hurt my dog!

1089
01:38:54,790 --> 01:38:56,690
Don't you make me hurt your dog!

1090
01:38:56,892 --> 01:38:59,053
You don't know what pain is!

1091
01:39:04,467 --> 01:39:08,062
Get me that telephone
or I'll kill him!

1092
01:39:12,608 --> 01:39:16,840
- Oh, fuck!
- You better get me that telephone!

1093
01:39:17,046 --> 01:39:19,139
I'm gonna do it, mister!!

1094
01:39:19,348 --> 01:39:23,409
I'm gonna snap her neck off,
I swear to God!

1095
01:39:23,886 --> 01:39:25,877
All right, mister. I'm doing it!

1096
01:39:49,445 --> 01:39:51,675
Okay, I'm coming.

1097
01:39:53,082 --> 01:39:54,447
We're going in.

1098
01:39:59,321 --> 01:40:01,516
Good afternoon. Sorry to bother you.

1099
01:40:01,724 --> 01:40:04,022
I'm looking for Mrs. Lippman's family.

1100
01:40:04,694 --> 01:40:06,787
FBI! Everybody down!

1101
01:40:07,763 --> 01:40:09,697
Lippmans don't live here anymore.

1102
01:40:09,899 --> 01:40:12,367
Excuse me, sir.
I need to speak with you.

1103
01:40:13,569 --> 01:40:15,332
- Clear!
- Clear!

1104
01:40:16,138 --> 01:40:18,163
What's the problem, officer?

1105
01:40:18,374 --> 01:40:21,104
I'm investigating the death
of Fredrica Bimmel.

1106
01:40:24,447 --> 01:40:26,048
There's no one here, Jack.

1107
01:40:28,717 --> 01:40:30,052
Clarice.

1108
01:40:30,185 --> 01:40:31,277
Your name is?

1109
01:40:31,486 --> 01:40:32,612
Oh, Jack Gordon.

1110
01:40:32,821 --> 01:40:34,686
Mr. Gordon. Good.

1111
01:40:34,890 --> 01:40:38,121
Fredrica worked for Mrs. Lippman.
Did you know her?

1112
01:40:39,094 --> 01:40:40,755
No, uh-uh.

1113
01:40:41,329 --> 01:40:42,796
Oh, wait.

1114
01:40:43,098 --> 01:40:45,293
Was she a great big fat person?

1115
01:40:46,201 --> 01:40:47,828
Yes, she was a big girl, sir.

1116
01:40:48,036 --> 01:40:49,526
Yeah, I may have...

1117
01:40:49,738 --> 01:40:52,229
No, I read about her in the newspaper.

1118
01:40:54,076 --> 01:40:56,442
Mrs. Lippman had a son.
Maybe he could help.

1119
01:40:56,645 --> 01:40:58,374
I got his card in here.

1120
01:40:58,580 --> 01:40:59,808
You want to come in?

1121
01:41:00,015 --> 01:41:01,107
- May I?
- Yeah, sure.

1122
01:41:01,316 --> 01:41:02,476
Thank you.

1123
01:41:21,336 --> 01:41:23,395
Are you close to catching somebody?

1124
01:41:25,173 --> 01:41:26,162
Yes.

1125
01:41:26,374 --> 01:41:27,568
We may be.

1126
01:41:29,411 --> 01:41:30,605
Did you...

1127
01:41:31,546 --> 01:41:35,141
...take over this place after
Mrs. Lippman died, is that right?

1128
01:41:36,451 --> 01:41:40,785
Yeah, I bought this house
two years ago.

1129
01:41:42,057 --> 01:41:45,390
Did she leave any records,
any business records...

1130
01:41:45,594 --> 01:41:49,428
...tax forms, lists of employees?

1131
01:41:50,065 --> 01:41:51,999
No, nothing like that at all.

1132
01:41:54,369 --> 01:41:57,099
Say, has the FBI learned something?

1133
01:41:57,305 --> 01:42:00,706
The police around here don't seem
to have the first clue.

1134
01:42:10,285 --> 01:42:14,984
Have you got, like, a description,
fingerprints, anything like that?

1135
01:42:16,424 --> 01:42:17,448
No.

1136
01:42:20,095 --> 01:42:21,426
No, we don't.

1137
01:42:32,807 --> 01:42:34,274
Here's that number.

1138
01:42:35,777 --> 01:42:37,438
Very good, Mr. Gordon.

1139
01:42:37,646 --> 01:42:39,477
May I use your phone, please?

1140
01:42:47,622 --> 01:42:49,647
Sure you can use my phone.

1141
01:42:51,159 --> 01:42:52,319
Freeze!

1142
01:42:53,161 --> 01:42:57,222
Put your hands over your head
and turn around. Spread your legs.

1143
01:42:58,400 --> 01:42:59,662
Spread your legs!

1144
01:42:59,868 --> 01:43:01,597
Put your hands in the back...

1145
01:43:01,803 --> 01:43:03,270
Freeze!

1146
01:44:15,844 --> 01:44:17,835
Hey!

1147
01:44:37,799 --> 01:44:40,131
Are you there?

1148
01:44:41,536 --> 01:44:44,664
I'm down here! I'm down here!

1149
01:45:03,858 --> 01:45:05,485
Catherine Martin?

1150
01:45:05,694 --> 01:45:07,059
Yes!

1151
01:45:08,763 --> 01:45:10,025
FBI.

1152
01:45:10,231 --> 01:45:11,528
You're safe.

1153
01:45:11,733 --> 01:45:14,702
Safe, shit! Get me out of here!

1154
01:45:29,818 --> 01:45:31,683
You're all right. Where is he?

1155
01:45:31,886 --> 01:45:34,855
How the fuck should I know?
Just get me out of here!

1156
01:45:35,056 --> 01:45:38,219
Catherine, you've gotta be quiet!
Now, shut that dog up!

1157
01:45:38,426 --> 01:45:40,485
Just get me out of here!

1158
01:45:41,596 --> 01:45:42,756
Oh, my God.

1159
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:49,227
Catherine, I'm gonna get you out.
But right now, you listen to me.

1160
01:45:49,437 --> 01:45:50,916
I've gotta leave. I'll be right back.

1161
01:45:50,951 --> 01:45:52,395
I've gotta leave. I'll be right back.

1162
01:45:52,506 --> 01:45:55,669
No! Don't you leave me here,
you fucking bitch! No!

1163
01:45:55,876 --> 01:45:57,400
Don't you leave me here!

1164
01:45:57,611 --> 01:46:00,341
This guy is fucking crazy!

1165
01:46:02,716 --> 01:46:07,551
Wait! I gotta get out of here!

1166
01:46:09,056 --> 01:46:10,045
Please!

1167
01:46:10,257 --> 01:46:14,956
Catherine! The other officers
will be here any minute now.

1168
01:46:15,162 --> 01:46:18,893
Wait! Don't go! Please!

1169
01:46:19,099 --> 01:46:20,396
Quiet!

1170
01:46:22,703 --> 01:46:25,263
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1171
01:50:21,074 --> 01:50:23,542
- You okay?
- Gunpowder. It's nothing, I'm okay.

1172
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:26,770
Agent Starling, how did you
track Buffalo Bill here?

1173
01:50:33,086 --> 01:50:35,953
Clarice M. Starling.

1174
01:50:38,125 --> 01:50:39,422
Congratulations.

1175
01:50:52,939 --> 01:50:55,703
Ernest W. Stevens.

1176
01:51:13,626 --> 01:51:15,526
Special Agent Starling!

1177
01:51:15,929 --> 01:51:17,829
- Special Agent Mapp.
- Phone call.

1178
01:51:18,031 --> 01:51:19,362
Thank you. Excuse me.

1179
01:51:19,566 --> 01:51:20,828
Starling.

1180
01:51:23,670 --> 01:51:26,537
Pilch, could you take our picture?

1181
01:51:26,773 --> 01:51:27,831
Sure.

1182
01:51:29,776 --> 01:51:31,903
I just wanted to say congratulations.

1183
01:51:32,278 --> 01:51:35,839
I'm no good at this kind of thing,
so I'm gonna duck out of here.

1184
01:51:36,316 --> 01:51:37,943
Okay. Sure.

1185
01:51:39,452 --> 01:51:41,113
Thank you, Mr. Crawford.

1186
01:51:48,928 --> 01:51:51,158
Your father would've been proud today.

1187
01:51:54,467 --> 01:51:56,196
Don't forget your phone call.

1188
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:02,205
Starling.

1189
01:52:02,442 --> 01:52:04,034
<i>Well, Clarice...</i>

1190
01:52:04,577 --> 01:52:07,068
...have the lambs stopped screaming?

1191
01:52:07,514 --> 01:52:08,640
Dr. Lecter?

1192
01:52:08,848 --> 01:52:11,874
Don't bother with a trace.
I won't be on long enough.

1193
01:52:15,388 --> 01:52:17,515
Where are you, Dr. Lecter?

1194
01:52:17,724 --> 01:52:19,589
I have no plans to call on you.

1195
01:52:19,793 --> 01:52:22,261
The world's more interesting
with you in it.

1196
01:52:22,796 --> 01:52:25,788
<i>So you take care now</i>
<i>to extend me the same courtesy.</i>

1197
01:52:25,999 --> 01:52:28,524
You know I can't make that promise.

1198
01:52:29,002 --> 01:52:31,368
I do wish we could chat longer...

1199
01:52:32,672 --> 01:52:35,368
...but I'm having
an old friend for dinner.

1200
01:52:36,843 --> 01:52:38,105
Bye.

1201
01:52:38,578 --> 01:52:39,909
<i>Dr. Lecter!</i>

1202
01:52:42,415 --> 01:52:43,848
Dr. Lecter.

1203
01:52:46,052 --> 01:52:47,519
Dr. Lecter.

1204
01:52:49,456 --> 01:52:51,014
Dr. Lecter?

1205
01:52:52,058 --> 01:52:53,457
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1206
01:52:53,660 --> 01:52:55,321
The security system's set up?

1207
01:52:55,528 --> 01:52:58,190
- We have the big shot security.
- I appreciate it.

1208
01:52:59,568 --> 01:53:40,123
