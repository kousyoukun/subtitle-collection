1
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,980
Starling!

2
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,860
Crawford wants to see you in his office.

3
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,930
Thank you, sir.

4
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,520
- Clarice. - Hey.

5
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,770
Looking for Crawford?

6
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,210
He should be back soon. Why don't you wait in his office?

7
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,830
Starling.

8
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:03,000
- Clarice M. Good morning. - Morning, Mr. Crawford.

9
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,540
Sorry to pull you off the course at such short notice.

10
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,610
Your instructors say you're in the top quarter of your class.

11
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,240
I hope so. They haven't posted any grades yet.

12
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,980
A job's come up, and I thought about you.

13
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,810
Not a job, really, more of an interesting errand.

14
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,250
Sit down.

15
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,760
Yes, sir.

16
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,300
I remember you from my seminar at UVA.

17
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,300
You grilled me on the bureau's civil rights record in the Hoover years.

18
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,430
I gave you an A.

19
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,130
A minus, sir.

20
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,070
Double major, psych and criminology, graduated magna.

21
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,970
Summer internships at the Reitzinger Clinic.

22
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,950
It says when you graduate you want to work for me in Behavioral Science.

23
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,180
Yes, very much, sir. Very much.

24
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,260
We're interviewing all serial killers in custody...

25
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,220
for a psycho-behavioral profile.

26
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,300
It could be a real help in unsolved cases.

27
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,070
Most of them have been happy to talk to us.

28
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,170
Do you spook easily, Starling?

29
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,330
Not yet, sir.

30
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,430
The one we want most refuses to help.

31
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,070
I want you to go after him in the asylum.

32
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,910
Who's the subject?

33
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,580
- The psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter. - "Hannibal the Cannibal."

34
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,410
I don't expect him to talk to you...

35
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,620
but I have to be able to say we tried.

36
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,750
If he won't cooperate, I want straight reporting.

37
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,760
How's he look? How's his cell?

38
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,570
Is he sketching, drawing? If he is, what's he sketching?

39
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,060
Here's a dossier on Lecter...

40
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,210
copy of our questionnaire and an I.D. for you.

41
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,550
Have your memo on my desk by 0800, Wednesday.

42
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,840
Okay.

43
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,490
Excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?

44
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,350
Lecter's been in prison for years.

45
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,720
Is there some connection between him and Buffalo Bill?

46
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,660
I wish there were. Now, I want your full attention, Starling.

47
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:10,330
- Yes, sir. - Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.

48
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,030
Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over all the physical procedures used.

49
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,080
Do not deviate from them for any reason whatsoever.

50
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,400
You're to tell him nothing personal.

51
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,910
You don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head.

52
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,310
Just do your job but never forget what he is.

53
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,940
And what is that?

54
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,280
Oh, he's a monster, a pure psychopath.

55
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,960
It's so rare to capture one alive.

56
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:41,190
From a research point of view, Lecter is our most prized asset.

57
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,040
We get a lot of detectives here...

58
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,540
but I must say I can't remember one as attractive.

59
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,540
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?

60
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,510
Because this can be quite a fun town if you have the right guide.

61
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,320
I'm sure this is a great town, Dr. Chilton...

62
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,320
but I must talk to Dr. Lecter and report back this afternoon.

63
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,160
I see. Well, let's make this quick, then.

64
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,930
We've tried to study him, but he's too sophisticated for the standard tests.

65
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,360
Oh, my, does he hate us.

66
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,700
He thinks I'm his nemesis.

67
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,830
Crawford's very clever, isn't he, using you?

68
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,480
- What do you mean, sir? - Pretty young woman to turn him on.

69
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,850
I don't believe Lecter's seen a woman in eight years, and you are his taste.

70
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,620
So to speak.

71
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,690
I graduated from UVA. It's not a charm school.

72
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,260
Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.

73
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,930
Do not touch or approach the glass. Pass him nothing but soft paper.

74
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,900
No pencils or pens, no staples or paper clips in his paper.

75
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,470
Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions.

76
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,870
If he passes you anything, do not accept.

77
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,540
- Do you understand? - Yes, I understand, sir.

78
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,510
I'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions.

79
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,790
On the afternoon of July 8, 1981...

80
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,820
he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary.

81
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,560
His mouthpiece was removed for an EKG.

82
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,690
When the nurse leaned over him, he did this to her.

83
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:25,930
The doctors managed to reset her jaw, more or less. Save one of her eyes.

84
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:31,000
His pulse never got above 85, even when he ate her tongue.

85
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,170
- I keep him in here. - Dr. Chilton.

86
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,320
If Lecter feels that you're his enemy, then...

87
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,950
Maybe we'll have more luck if I go by myself.

88
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,650
What do you think?

89
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,260
You might have suggested this in my office and saved me the time.

90
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,830
Yes, sir, but then I would have missed the pleasure of your company, sir.

91
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,940
When she's finished, bring her out.

92
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:36,140
Hi, I'm Barney. He told you, don't get near the glass?

93
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,570
Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.

94
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,550
Nice to meet you. You can hang your coat there if you like.

95
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,910
Okay. Thank you, I will.

96
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,550
He's past the others. The last cell.

97
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,480
You keep to the right.

98
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,360
- I put out a chair for you. - Yes, that's very good, thank you.

99
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,660
I'll be watching. You'll do fine.

100
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,860
I can smell your cunt.

101
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,940
Good morning.

102
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,810
Dr. Lecter, my name is Clarice Starling. May I speak with you?

103
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,950
You're one of Jack Crawford's, aren't you?

104
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,510
I am, yes.

105
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,590
May I see your credentials?

106
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,260
Certainly.

107
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,140
Closer, please.

108
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,570
Closer.

109
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,090
That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?

110
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,030
I'm still in training at the academy.

111
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:45,130
- Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me? - Yes, I'm a student.

112
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,370
I'm here to learn from you.

113
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,830
Maybe you can decide if I'm qualified enough to do that.

114
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,370
That is rather slippery of you, Agent Starling.

115
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,540
Sit. Please.

116
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,900
Now then, tell me. What did Miggs say to you?

117
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,730
"Multiple Miggs" in the next cell.

118
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,090
He hissed at you. What did he say?

119
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,370
He said, "I can smell your cunt."

120
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,070
I see.

121
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,500
I myself cannot.

122
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,150
You use Evyan skin cream.

123
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,530
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps.

124
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,500
But not today.

125
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,530
Did you do all these drawings?

126
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,040
That is the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere.

127
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,040
Do you know Florence?

128
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,950
All that detail just from memory, sir?

129
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,790
Memory, Agent Starling, is what I have instead of a view.

130
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,080
Perhaps you'd care to lend us your view on this questionnaire, sir.

131
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:20,730
No, no, no. You were doing fine.

132
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,900
You had been courteous and receptive to courtesy.

133
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:28,600
You had established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs.

134
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,470
And now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire.

135
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,110
It won't do.

136
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,410
I'm only asking you to look at this. Either you will or you won't.

137
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,310
Yeah. Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed...

138
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,060
if he's recruiting help from the student body.

139
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,120
Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill.

140
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,660
What a naughty boy he is.

141
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,330
Do you know why he's called "Buffalo Bill"?

142
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,870
Please tell me. The newspapers won't say.

143
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,330
It started as a joke in Kansas City Homicide.

144
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,770
They said, "This one likes to skin his humps."

145
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,410
Why do you think...

146
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,340
he removes their skins, Agent Starling?

147
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,880
Thrill me with your acumen.

148
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,220
It excites him.

149
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,550
Most serial killers keep trophies from their victims.

150
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,420
- I didn't. - No.

151
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,260
No, you ate yours.

152
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,000
You send that through now.

153
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:03,600
You think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?

154
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,130
No! I thought that your knowledge...

155
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,700
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

156
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,680
You know what you look like, with your good bag and your cheap shoes?

157
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,310
You look like a rube.

158
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:20,140
A well-scrubbed, hustling rube with a little taste.

159
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,180
Nutrition has given you some length of bone...

160
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,550
but you're not more than one generation from white trash...

161
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,520
are you, Agent Starling?

162
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,520
The accent you've tried so desperately to shed...

163
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,890
pure West Virginia.

164
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,160
Is your father a coal miner?

165
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,030
Does he stink of the lamp?

166
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,100
I know how quickly the boys found you, all those tedious, sticky fumblings...

167
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,740
in the back seats of cars, while you dreamed of getting out.

168
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,340
Getting anywhere.

169
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,150
Getting all the way to the FBI.

170
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,220
You see a lot, doctor.

171
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,920
But are you strong enough to point that...

172
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,690
high-powered perception at yourself?

173
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,850
What about it?

174
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,230
Why don't you look at yourself and write down what you see?

175
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,130
Or maybe you're afraid to.

176
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,740
A census taker once tried to test me.

177
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,350
I ate his liver with some fava beans...

178
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,850
and a nice Chianti.

179
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,030
You fly back to school now, little Starling.

180
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,400
Fly, fly, fly.

181
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,250
I bit my wrist...

182
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,490
so I could die.

183
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,080
Look at the blood!

184
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,390
Gotcha.

185
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,920
Miggs! You stupid fuck!

186
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,070
Agent Starling! Come back! Agent Starling! Agent Starling!

187
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,600
I would not have had that happen. Discourtesy is ugly to me.

188
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,240
- Then do this test! - No, but I will make you happy.

189
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,010
- I'll give you a chance at your love. - What?

190
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,910
Advancement. Listen. Look deep within yourself, Clarice Starling.

191
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,380
Go seek out Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T.

192
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,220
I don't think Miggs could manage again so soon...

193
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,650
even though he is crazy. Go now!

194
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,390
Hi, Bill.

195
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,830
- Daddy! - Hey, Clarice.

196
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,650
- Did you get any bad guys, Daddy? - No, angel. They all got away.

197
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,350
Ah, shoot.

198
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,000
FBI! Hands up! Don't move!

199
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,710
Turn around. Hands behind your back. Thumbs up.

200
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,480
You're dead, Starling.

201
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:18,210
Johnson, good entry, good command. Starling, where's your danger area?

202
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,790
- In the corner. - Did you check it?

203
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,580
- No, sir. - That's why you're dead.

204
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,960
3-1-0-9?

205
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:29,560
Breaking doors or windows to enter or exit.

206
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,830
Rule 404?

207
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,020
Clarice, phone. It's the guru.

208
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,810
Crawford? Thanks, Ardelia.

209
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,760
- Starling? - Sir.

210
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,390
Miggs is dead.

211
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,500
Dead?

212
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,690
How?

213
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,490
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him all afternoon.

214
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,260
They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his tongue.

215
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,440
Starling?

216
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,020
Yeah. I'm still here, sir. I just...

217
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,870
I don't know how to feel about this.

218
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,920
You don't have to feel any way. Lecter did it to amuse himself.

219
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,150
Look, I know it got ugly today...

220
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:32,060
but you mentioned a name, "Mofet." Any follow-up on her?

221
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,890
He destroyed most of his patients' histories prior to capture...

222
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,570
so there's no record of anyone named Mofet.

223
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:44,900
But I thought the "yourself' reference was too hokey for Lecter...

224
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:49,310
so I figured he's from Baltimore, and I looked in the phone book.

225
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,780
And there's a "Your Self' storage facility...

226
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,450
right outside of downtown Baltimore, sir.

227
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,920
Unit 31 was leased...

228
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,390
for 10 years, prepaid in full.

229
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,460
The contract was in the name...

230
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,430
of a Miss Hester Mofet.

231
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,260
So nobody's been in here since 1980?

232
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,260
Not to my knowledge.

233
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,600
Privacy is a great concern to my customers.

234
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,500
Yes, I won't disturb anything, I promise.

235
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,750
I'll be out of here before you know it.

236
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,540
- May I help you? - Yes, actually.

237
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,850
Here.

238
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:36,120
- It's stuck. - We could return tomorrow with my son.

239
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,760
What about him?

240
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:45,070
I would ask my driver to help you, but he detests physical labor.

241
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,860
Right.

242
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,130
You stay here. I'll be back in one minute.

243
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,430
It's stuck. Will you hand me that flashlight?

244
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,590
If this door should fall down...

245
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,590
or anything else...

246
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,090
this is the number for our Baltimore office.

247
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,190
They know that you're with me.

248
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,130
- Call them if anything should happen. - Yes, Miss Starling.

249
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,120
Clarice. Here, they're waiting for you.

250
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,630
Watch your step.

251
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,890
Hester Mofet. It's an anagram, isn't it, doctor?

252
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:38,000
Hester Mofet: "The rest of me"?

253
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:42,340
"Miss The Rest Of Me," meaning that you rented that garage?

254
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,310
Thank you.

255
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,810
Your bleeding has stopped.

256
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,470
How did...?

257
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,550
It's nothing.

258
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,680
It's just a scratch.

259
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,580
Dr. Lecter, whose head is in that bottle?

260
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,920
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?

261
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,790
Do you know something about him?

262
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,760
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.

263
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:47,270
Let's talk about Miss Mofet. You wanted me to find him.

264
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:53,410
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine...

265
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,580
whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic.

266
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,410
I did not kill him, merely tucked him away, very much as I found him...

267
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,990
after he'd missed three appointments.

268
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,320
If you didn't kill him, who did?

269
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,520
Who can say? Best thing for him, really.

270
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,200
His therapy was going nowhere.

271
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,790
His dress, makeup...

272
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,800
Raspail was a transvestite?

273
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:25,670
In life? Oh, no. Garden variety manic-depressive.

274
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,340
Tedious, very tedious.

275
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,980
I now think of him as an experiment.

276
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,680
A fledgling killer's first effort at transformation.

277
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,650
How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice?

278
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,950
Scared at first, then...

279
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,390
exhilarated.

280
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,220
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he?

281
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:48,120
Apparently, he likes you and you like him too.

282
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,590
I never thought about it.

283
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,830
Do you think Jack Crawford wants you, sexually?

284
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:59,200
He is much older, but do you think he visualizes scenarios, exchanges?

285
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,570
Fucking you?

286
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:08,740
That doesn't interest me. It's the sort of thing that Miggs would say.

287
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,290
Not anymore.

288
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,520
Thank you, Barney.

289
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,400
What happened to your drawings?

290
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:33,570
Punishment, you see, for Miggs. Just like that gospel program.

291
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,510
When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up.

292
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:40,070
Dr. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.

293
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:43,110
What did you mean by "transformation," doctor?

294
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,630
I've been in this room for eight years now, Clarice.

295
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:59,370
I know they will never ever let me out while I'm alive.

296
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,330
What I want is a view.

297
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:06,300
I want a window where I can see a tree or even water.

298
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,170
I want to be in a federal institution far away from Dr. Chilton.

299
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,780
What did you mean by "fledgling killer"?

300
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,740
Are you saying he's killed again?

301
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,310
I'm offering you a psychological profile on Buffalo Bill...

302
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,610
based on the case evidence.

303
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,060
I'll help you catch him, Clarice.

304
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,030
You know who he is, don't you?

305
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,570
Tell me who decapitated your patient, doctor.

306
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:43,570
All good things to those who wait.

307
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:48,210
I've waited, Clarice. But how long can you and old Jackie-boy wait?

308
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:53,950
Our little Billy must already be searching for that next special lady.

309
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,250
Hey, little cheeper.

310
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,200
I'll be right there.

311
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:29,850
Jeez!

312
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,620
Can I help you with that?

313
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,690
Would you?

314
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,090
Sure.

315
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:42,630
Thank you.

316
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:45,160
That's all right. You look kind of handicapped.

317
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:49,300
Yeah. I got it this far, I just can't get it up in the truck by myself.

318
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,400
Here, grab this. Up!

319
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,860
Okay.

320
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,440
Just set it down. That's good.

321
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:59,410
Get in the truck. I want to push it all the way up.

322
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,780
I really appreciate this. Thank you.

323
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,320
Just go all the way back.

324
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,550
Okay. Is this good?

325
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:10,590
Yeah, that's good.

326
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,790
- That's great. - Okay.

327
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:17,170
Say, are you about a size 14?

328
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:18,560
Sorry?

329
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,120
Good.

330
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:03,440
Oh, good. Good.

331
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,360
Holds!

332
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,430
Ones!

333
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,200
Starling!

334
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,050
Outside. Let's go.

335
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:42,810
Cindy, in the ring for Starling. Let's go!

336
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,960
Pack your field gear.

337
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,820
- You're going with Crawford. - Where?

338
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,690
Found a girl's body in West Virginia.

339
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,600
Been in the water a week. Looks like Buffalo Bill.

340
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,790
Keeps them alive for three days. We don't know why.

341
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:19,080
No evidence of rape or physical abuse prior to death.

342
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,760
All the mutilation you see there is postmortem.

343
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,420
Okay, three days...

344
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,960
then he shoots them, skins them and dumps them

345
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,790
Each body in a different river.

346
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:33,190
The water leaves us no trace evidence of any kind.

347
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,800
That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one.

348
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,840
Her body was the only one he weighted down.

349
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,870
So actually, she was the third girl found.

350
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,370
After her, he got lazy.

351
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,880
Okay, let's see.

352
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:53,350
Circles where the girls were abducted. Arrows where their bodies were found.

353
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:58,650
This new one today washed up here. Elk River, West Virginia.

354
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,980
Look at him, Starling. Tell me what you see.

355
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,680
Well, he's a white male.

356
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,790
Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic groups.

357
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,990
He's not a drifter. He's got his own house, not an apartment.

358
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,860
- Why? - What he does with them takes privacy.

359
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:40,500
He's in his 30s or 40s. He's got real physical strength.

360
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,040
Combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise.

361
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,310
And he's never impulsive. He'll never stop.

362
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,170
Why not?

363
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:56,140
He's got a real taste for it now, and he's getting better at his work.

364
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:00,650
Not bad, Starling. Questions?

365
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,690
Yes, sir.

366
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:06,620
You haven't mentioned anything about the information in my report...

367
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,260
or Dr. Lecter's offer, sir.

368
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,260
I'm considering it.

369
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,360
That's why you sent me in there, isn't it?

370
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,730
To get his help on Buffalo Bill, sir?

371
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,430
Well, if that was the case, then I just...

372
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,410
I just wish I was in on it, that's all.

373
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,780
If I'd sent you in there with a real agenda, Lecter would have known it.

374
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:32,540
He would have toyed with you, then turned to stone.

375
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,880
Excuse me, Sheriff Perkins?

376
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,390
These are the FBI people.

377
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:14,690
Sheriff Perkins, Jack Crawford, FBI. Special Agent Terry, Agent Starling.

378
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:17,490
We appreciate being invited to your jurisdiction.

379
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:21,000
Somebody from the state attorney's office called you.

380
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,300
We'll extend you every courtesy, but right now...

381
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,730
Sheriff...

382
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:30,170
this type of sex crime has aspects I'd just as soon discuss in private.

383
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,980
Know what I mean?

384
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,320
Oscar, fetch Dr. Akin from the chapel.

385
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,950
We're back here.

386
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:29,960
Tell Lamar to come on when he's finished playing his music.

387
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,600
Yeah, we'll be sending in a minute.

388
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,630
It's working.

389
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:39,200
I need a six-way link up. Chicago, Detroit...

390
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,810
What? What?

391
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,440
Excuse me.

392
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,950
Excuse me, officers and gentlemen. Listen here, now.

393
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,350
There's things we need to do for her.

394
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,060
Y'all brought her this far, and her folks would thank you if they could...

395
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,860
for your kindness and your sensitivity.

396
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,790
Please, go on now, and let us take care of her.

397
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,120
Go on, now.

398
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,300
Thank you.

399
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:14,800
Thank you.

400
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:17,840
Okay, good.

401
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:30,820
Yeah, that's right. Elk River. Stand by for transmission.

402
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:35,890
Ray.

403
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,170
Doctor, Lamar. Let's take a look at her.

404
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,490
Jesus...

405
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:17,960
Okay, Starling.

406
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:45,360
Star-shaped contact entrance wound over the sternum.

407
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:49,170
A muzzle stamp at the top.

408
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,040
- Wrongful death. - Wrongful death.

409
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:55,970
She'll have to go to the state pathologist's at Claxton.

410
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,400
Well, I better get back to that service.

411
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,910
Lamar will help you.

412
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,810
Lord Almighty.

413
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:08,820
What else do you see, Starling?

414
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,390
Well, she's not local.

415
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,360
Her ears are pierced three times and there's...

416
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,800
glitter nail polish. It looks like town to me.

417
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,940
Two of her fingernails are broken off...

418
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:32,440
and there's dirt or grit under them.

419
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,710
It looks like she's tried to claw her way through something.

420
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:38,880
Ray, get pictures of her teeth. We'll fax them to Missing Persons.

421
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,380
Right.

422
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,330
Let's do another.

423
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,100
She's got something in her throat.

424
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,610
When a body comes out of the water...

425
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,410
lots of times there's leaves and things in the mouth.

426
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,110
What is that?

427
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,870
Some kind of seedpod?

428
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:45,920
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.

429
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:49,160
There's no way that could get way down in there.

430
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:52,050
Not unless somebody shoved it in there.

431
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,720
She'll be easier to print when we turn her.

432
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,230
Lamar, give me a hand?

433
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,930
Yes, sir, I will.

434
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:08,040
Oh, Jack. What do you make of these?

435
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:11,470
Different configuration than the other victims. Get close-ups.

436
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,240
Victim's skin removed...

437
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:16,580
in two diamond-shaped sections above the buttocks.

438
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:19,980
Exit wound level with the second or third thoracic vertebrae...

439
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,990
approximately six inches from the right shoulder blade.

440
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:24,620
Starling...

441
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:29,260
when I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman...

442
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:31,060
that burned you, didn't it?

443
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:34,730
It was just smoke, Starling. I had to get rid of him

444
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,700
It matters, Mr. Crawford.

445
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,100
Cops look at you to see how to act.

446
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,740
It matters.

447
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,310
Point taken.

448
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:50,510
Ligature marks found around wrists...

449
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:52,310
not around the ankles.

450
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,350
This would indicate that the skinning was postmortem.

451
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,340
Time, Pilch. My move.

452
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:25,380
- No fair! You lured him with produce. - Tough noogies. It's still my turn.

453
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,790
Nice and slow, baby.

454
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,560
If the beetle moves one of your men, does that still count?

455
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:35,360
Of course it counts. How do you play?

456
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,160
Agent Starling?

457
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,260
Where the heck did this come from?

458
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:43,260
It's practically mush.

459
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:47,740
It was found in a murder victim. The body was in the Elk River.

460
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:49,380
It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?

461
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,910
I can't tell you any more.

462
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,340
We heard it on the radio.

463
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,850
You mean this is a clue from a real murder case? Cool!

464
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,640
Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.

465
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,750
Sphingid Ceratomia, maybe...

466
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:04,620
Boy, he's a big sucker.

467
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:06,760
Okay...

468
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:08,860
let's check morphology.

469
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:20,430
What do you do when you're not detecting, Agent Starling?

470
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,350
Try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.

471
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:27,420
You ever go out for cheeseburgers and beer?

472
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:30,450
The amusing house wine?

473
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:32,480
Are you hitting on me, doctor?

474
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,190
- Yes. - Gotcha!

475
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:36,250
What do you got?

476
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:41,330
Agent Starling, meet Mr. Acherontia Styx.

477
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:42,690
Weird.

478
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:46,090
Better known to his friends as the Death's-head moth.

479
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:47,460
Where does it come from?

480
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,570
That's what's strange. They only live in Asia.

481
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:53,430
They're specially raised from imported eggs.

482
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:57,010
Somebody grew this guy. Fed him honey and nightshade.

483
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,970
Kept him warm.

484
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,540
Somebody loved him.

485
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:37,480
Where are you?!

486
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,020
Let me out of here!

487
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,320
Hey!

488
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:51,930
Please help me!

489
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,830
Help me, please!

490
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:59,570
Why won't you answer me?! Please!

491
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:05,810
- Good morning. I'm Donna Ferucchi. - I'm Gene Cassel with sports.

492
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,920
And I'm Tim Langhorn. Our top story this morning:

493
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:13,620
Catherine Martin, the 25-year-old daughter of Senator Ruth Martin...

494
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:15,120
listed as a missing person...

495
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:19,830
is believed to have been kidnapped by the killer known as "Buffalo Bill."

496
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:23,460
Memphis police say the missing girl's blouse has been identified...

497
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:28,100
sliced up the back, in what has become a kind of grim calling card.

498
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,870
Young Catherine is the only daughter of U.S. Senator Ruth Martin...

499
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,640
the Republican senator from Tennessee.

500
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:38,440
And while her kidnapping is not considered politically motivated...

501
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:41,550
it has stirred the government to its highest levels.

502
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,550
Reached for comment on the ski slopes of Vermont...

503
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:48,350
the president himself said to be, and I quote, "intensely concerned."

504
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:53,150
Just moments ago, Senator Martin taped this dramatic personal plea:

505
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:57,130
I'm speaking, now, to the person holding my daughter.

506
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:01,700
Catherine is very gentle and kind.

507
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,470
Talk to her and you'll see.

508
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:09,640
You have the power. You are in charge.

509
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:15,750
I know you can feel love and compassion.

510
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:20,780
You have a wonderful chance to show the whole world...

511
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,490
that you can be merciful, as well as strong.

512
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,420
That you're big enough to treat Catherine better...

513
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,860
than the world has treated you.

514
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,560
You have that power.

515
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:36,340
Please. My daughter is Catherine.

516
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,630
Boy, that's smart.

517
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:40,270
Jesus, that's really smart.

518
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:42,440
She keeps repeating the name.

519
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:47,240
If he sees Catherine as a person, not an object, it's harder to tear her up.

520
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:51,150
Please, release my little girl.

521
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:55,010
What you're doing, Ms. Starling, is coming into my hospital...

522
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,780
and refusing to share information with me for the third time.

523
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,600
Sir, I told you this is just a routine follow-up on the Raspail...

524
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,930
He is my patient. I have rights.

525
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:06,900
I understand that.

526
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:11,640
Look, I am not just some turnkey, Miss Starling.

527
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:15,000
This is the number for the U.S. Attorney.

528
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,510
Please, either discuss it with him or let me do my job, you understand?

529
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,220
If your profile helps us catch Buffalo Bill...

530
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:31,020
in time to save Catherine Martin...

531
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:34,730
the senator promises you a transfer to the VA Hospital...

532
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:38,360
at Oneida Park, New York, with a view of the woods nearby.

533
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:41,260
Maximum security still applies, of course.

534
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,270
You'd have reasonable access to books.

535
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,270
Best of all, though...

536
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:51,500
one week of the year, you get to leave the hospital...

537
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,050
and go here:

538
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:58,480
Plum Island.

539
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,680
Every day of that week, you may walk on the beach

540
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,090
You may swim in the ocean for up to one hour...

541
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,890
under SWAT team surveillance, of course.

542
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:11,260
And there you have it.

543
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:18,270
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.

544
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,640
A copy of the senator's offer.

545
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:25,140
This offer is non-negotiable and final.

546
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,380
Catherine Martin dies, you get nothing.

547
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:43,320
Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center.

548
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:46,600
Sounds charming.

549
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:51,000
That's only part of the island. There's a very nice beach.

550
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:53,470
Terns nest there. There's beautiful...

551
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,800
Terns?

552
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:59,840
If I help you, Clarice, it will be "turns" with us too.

553
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,140
Quid pro quo. I tell you things, you tell me things.

554
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,980
Not about this case, though. About yourself.

555
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:09,120
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?

556
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,130
Yes or no, Clarice? Poor little Catherine is waiting.

557
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,800
Go, doctor.

558
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,590
What is your worst memory of childhood?

559
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:25,230
The death of my father.

560
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:29,200
Tell me about it. And don't lie, or I'll know.

561
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,410
He was a town marshal...

562
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:38,980
and one night he surprised two burglars coming out of a drugstore.

563
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,150
They shot him.

564
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:45,050
Was he killed outright?

565
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:49,820
No, he was very strong. He lasted more than a month.

566
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,970
My mother died when I was very young, so...

567
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:58,160
my father had become the whole world to me...

568
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,710
and when he left me, I had nothing. I was 10 years old.

569
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:05,110
You're very frank, Clarice.

570
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:10,140
I think it would be quite something to know you in private life.

571
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:13,920
Quid pro quo, doctor.

572
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:19,560
So tell me about Miss West Virginia. Was she a large girl?

573
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:23,130
Yes.

574
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:25,760
Big through the hips, roomy?

575
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:27,300
They all were.

576
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,200
What else?

577
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:33,140
She had an object deliberately inserted into her throat.

578
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:37,910
Now, that hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what it means.

579
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,740
Was it a butterfly?

580
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,780
Yes. A moth.

581
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:49,080
Just like the one we found in Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.

582
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:51,890
Why does he place them there, doctor?

583
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:56,590
The significance of the moth is change.

584
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,940
Caterpillar into chrysalis, or pupa...

585
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:03,360
and from thence into beauty.

586
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:06,670
Our Billy wants to change too.

587
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:10,640
There's no correlation between transsexualism and violence.

588
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:13,580
- Transsexuals are very passive. - Clever girl.

589
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:17,580
You're so close to the way you're gonna catch him. Do you realize that?

590
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:19,680
No. Tell me why.

591
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:24,250
After your father's murder you were orphaned. What happened next?

592
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:32,390
I don't imagine the answer is on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.

593
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:36,430
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana.

594
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:38,000
They had a ranch.

595
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:39,970
Was it a cattle ranch?

596
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,030
Sheep and horses.

597
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,910
How long did you live there?

598
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:45,980
Two months.

599
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:47,670
Why so briefly?

600
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:49,340
I ran away.

601
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,650
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher make you perform fellatio?

602
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:55,820
Did he sodomize you?

603
00:56:56,590 --> 00:57:00,080
No. He was a very decent man.

604
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,020
Quid pro quo, doctor.

605
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:07,700
Billy is not a real transsexual.

606
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,770
But he thinks he is. He tries to be.

607
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:12,840
He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.

608
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:17,210
You said I was very close to the way we'd catch him. What did you mean?

609
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,940
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery:

610
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:24,310
Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical Center.

611
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:27,820
I wouldn't be surprised if Billy applied for sex reassignment...

612
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:31,720
at one or all of them, and been rejected.

613
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:33,690
On what basis would they reject him?

614
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:39,270
Look for severe childhood disturbances associated with violence.

615
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:42,330
Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice...

616
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:46,540
he was made one through years of systematic abuse.

617
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,210
Billy hates his own identity, you see...

618
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:53,140
and he thinks that makes him a transsexual...

619
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:57,540
but his pathology is a thousand times more savage...

620
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:59,480
and more terrifying.

621
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:06,890
It rubs the lotion on its skin. It does this whenever it's told.

622
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,090
Mister, my family will pay cash.

623
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:12,490
Whatever ransom you're asking for, they'll pay it.

624
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:18,140
It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.

625
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,240
Yes, she will, Precious. She'll get the hose.

626
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:26,040
Okay, okay, okay.

627
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:28,910
Okay, I'll do it.

628
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:30,620
Okay.

629
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:37,120
Mister, if you let me go, I won't press charges. I promise.

630
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:40,630
See, my mom is a real important woman.

631
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:42,760
I guess you already know that.

632
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:45,970
Now it places the lotion in the basket.

633
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:47,540
Please!

634
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,500
Please, I want to go home.

635
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:54,400
I want to go home! Please! Please let me.

636
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,010
It places the lotion in the basket.

637
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:02,040
I want to see my mommy. Please let me.

638
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:06,480
I want to see my mom again. I want...

639
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:09,220
I want to see my mom.

640
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,460
Put the fucking lotion in the basket!

641
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:52,300
You still think you're gonna walk on some beach and see the birdies?

642
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:54,300
I don't think so.

643
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,630
I called Senator Ruth Martin.

644
00:59:57,910 --> 01:00:00,530
She never heard of any deal with you.

645
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,970
They scammed you, Hannibal.

646
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:06,980
Stand outside.

647
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:09,940
And shut the door.

648
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:11,550
Barney.

649
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,960
There never was a deal with Senator Martin, but there is now.

650
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:23,390
I designed it.

651
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:27,290
Of course, I worked in a few conditions for my own benefit as well.

652
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,630
Identify Buffalo Bill by name...

653
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:32,900
and if the girl is found in time...

654
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:37,370
you'll be transferred to Brushy Mountain State Prison in Tennessee.

655
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:40,280
Answer me, Hannibal.

656
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:43,450
You answer me now...

657
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:46,680
or, by God, you'll never leave this cell.

658
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,190
Who is Buffalo Bill?

659
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:54,220
His first name is Louis.

660
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:58,190
I'll tell the rest to the Senator herself, but only in Tennessee.

661
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,870
And I have a few conditions of my own.

662
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:05,600
Clean him up and get him ready to go.

663
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:09,840
Jack, Hannibal Lecter is being transferred to Memphis.

664
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:10,780
Transferred?

665
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:15,820
Did you have a trainee make a phony offer to Lecter in the senator's name?

666
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:17,980
I rolled the dice. I had to.

667
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,290
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.

668
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,350
Paul Krendler's here from Justice.

669
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:25,390
She's asking him to take over in Memphis.

670
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:51,880
Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter.

671
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:54,710
I'm Lieutenant Boyle. This is Sergeant Patrick.

672
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:57,080
We'll treat you as good as you treat us.

673
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:00,390
You be a gentleman, you'll get three hots and a cot.

674
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:05,230
Sir, if you sign right here, we'll have us a legal transfer.

675
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:12,260
Here, sir, use mine.

676
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:00,450
Senator Martin...

677
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:04,020
Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

678
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:10,320
Dr. Lecter...

679
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:14,270
l've brought an affidavit guaranteeing your new rights.

680
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,040
You'll want to read it before I sign.

681
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:24,940
I won't waste your time or Catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges.

682
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:28,980
Clarice Starling and Jack Crawford have wasted too much time already.

683
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,590
I only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl.

684
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,920
Let me help you now. I will trust you when it is all over.

685
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:39,430
You have my word. Paul.

686
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:44,600
Buffalo Bill's real name is Louis Friend.

687
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:49,830
I met him just once. He was referred to me in April or May, 1980...

688
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:52,730
by my patient Benjamin Raspail.

689
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,870
They were lovers, you see.

690
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:59,180
But Raspail had become very frightened.

691
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:02,880
Apparently, Louis had murdered a transient...

692
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,410
and done things with the skin.

693
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:09,860
We need his address and a physical description.

694
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:12,990
Tell me, senator.

695
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:15,930
Did you nurse Catherine yourself?

696
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,990
- What? - Did you breast-feed her?

697
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:21,600
- Now, wait a minute! - Yes. I did.

698
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Toughened your nipples, didn't it?

699
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:25,140
You son of a bitch!

700
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:29,440
Amputate a man's leg, and he can still feel it tickling.

701
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:33,040
Tell me, Mom, when your little girl is on the slab...

702
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:34,680
where will it tickle you?

703
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:38,980
Take this thing back to Baltimore.

704
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:42,890
Five-foot-ten, strongly built, about 180 pounds.

705
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:45,730
Hair, blond. Eyes, pale blue.

706
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:47,150
He'd be about 35 now.

707
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:50,190
He said he lived in Philadelphia but may have lied.

708
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:52,120
That's all I can remember, Mom.

709
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,030
But if I think of any more, I will let you know.

710
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,940
Oh, and senator, just one more thing:

711
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,070
Love your suit.

712
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:09,180
In a meeting earlier today with Senator Ruth Martin...

713
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:13,680
Dr. Lecter agreed to help in the investigation to find Buffalo Bill.

714
01:05:16,190 --> 01:05:17,990
- How do you fit in? - My unique insight...

715
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,120
into Lecter made the breakthrough.

716
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,480
Buffalo Bill's name?

717
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,390
His name is now a matter of record with the proper authorities.

718
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:28,100
- Can you give us...? - I'm Dr. Frederick Chilton.

719
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:29,900
- Spell it? - That's C-H...

720
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:33,500
Are you with Dr. Chilton's group?

721
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,240
Well, I just saw him outside, sir.

722
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:39,740
Access to Lecter is limited. We've received death threats.

723
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:41,520
I understand, sir.

724
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,250
Log in and check your weapon.

725
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:52,950
I can't take all the credit myself.

726
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:55,460
Senator Martin, Justice Department, FBI...

727
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:59,060
folks at the Baltimore State Hospital. Now for the hard part:

728
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,030
Apprehending the suspect.

729
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,670
Excuse me, I have to catch a flight.

730
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:10,100
Command desk, Officer Jacobs.

731
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:22,150
- Is it true what they're saying? - Huh?

732
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:25,190
He's some kind of vampire?

733
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:29,620
They don't have a name for what he is.

734
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:32,390
You do know the rules, ma'am?

735
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:35,500
Yes, I've questioned him before.

736
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:39,940
Go ahead.

737
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:19,410
Good evening, Clarice.

738
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:23,710
I thought you might like your drawings back.

739
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,350
Just until you get your view.

740
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:31,380
How very thoughtful.

741
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:35,060
Or did Jack Crawford send you for one last wheedle...

742
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:37,560
before you're both booted off the case?

743
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:40,260
No. I came because I wanted to.

744
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:47,370
People will say we're in love.

745
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:54,010
Anthrax Island.

746
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:57,150
That was an especially nice touch, Clarice.

747
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,350
Yours?

748
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:00,190
Yes.

749
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:01,920
Yeah.

750
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:04,280
That was good.

751
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:06,420
Pity about poor Catherine, though.

752
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,760
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

753
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:11,660
Your anagrams are showing, doctor.

754
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:14,070
Louis Friend?

755
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:18,000
Iron sulfide, also known as fool's gold.

756
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:22,270
Oh, Clarice, your problem is, you need to get more fun out of life.

757
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:25,710
You were telling me the truth back in Baltimore, sir.

758
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,410
Please continue now.

759
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:30,520
Well, I've read the case files. Have you?

760
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:33,990
Everything you need to find him is there in those pages.

761
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:37,020
- Then tell me how. - First principles, Clarice.

762
01:08:37,390 --> 01:08:40,380
Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius.

763
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:44,030
Of each particular thing, ask: What is it in itself?

764
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:45,990
What is its nature?

765
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:50,330
What does he do, this man you seek?

766
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:53,130
He kills women.

767
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:56,270
No. That is incidental.

768
01:08:56,910 --> 01:09:02,440
What is the principle thing he does? What needs does he serve by killing?

769
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:04,210
Anger...

770
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:09,910
social acceptance and sexual frustration...

771
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:11,020
No!

772
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,730
He covets.

773
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,130
That is his nature.

774
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:18,960
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?

775
01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:22,330
Do we seek out things to covet?

776
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:24,800
Make an effort to answer now.

777
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:27,510
No, we just...

778
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:31,070
No, we begin by coveting what we see every day.

779
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:34,580
Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice?

780
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:38,680
And don't your eyes seek out the things you want?

781
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,750
All right, yes. Now, please tell me how.

782
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:43,390
No.

783
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:46,060
It is your turn to tell me, Clarice.

784
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:48,760
You don't have any more vacations to sell.

785
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,930
Why did you leave that ranch?

786
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:56,330
Doctor, we don't have any more time for any of this now.

787
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,000
But we don't reckon time the same way, do we?

788
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:01,040
This is all the time you'll have.

789
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:03,600
Later. Please listen. We've only got five...

790
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:06,940
No! I will listen now.

791
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:11,980
Your father's murder orphaned you when you were 10.

792
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:17,050
You went to live with cousins on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And?

793
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:21,590
And one morning I just ran away.

794
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:25,830
Not "just," Clarice. What set you off?

795
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:27,600
You started at what time?

796
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:29,660
Early, still dark.

797
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:32,440
Then something woke you. Was it a dream?

798
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:33,800
What was it?

799
01:10:35,410 --> 01:10:37,040
I heard a strange noise.

800
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:39,680
What was it?

801
01:10:40,350 --> 01:10:41,510
It was...

802
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:44,220
screaming.

803
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:48,450
Some kind of screaming, like a child's voice.

804
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,520
What did you do?

805
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,390
I went...

806
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:55,250
downstairs. Outside.

807
01:10:57,530 --> 01:11:00,000
I crept up into the barn.

808
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:03,460
I was so scared to look inside, but I had to.

809
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:07,870
And what did you see, Clarice? What did you see?

810
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:10,610
Lambs.

811
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:13,440
They were screaming.

812
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:16,780
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?

813
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:19,080
And they were screaming.

814
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,110
And you ran away?

815
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:26,150
No. First I tried to free them.

816
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,290
I opened the gate to their pen.

817
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,930
They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run.

818
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:35,630
But you could and you did, didn't you?

819
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:39,840
Yes. I took one lamb and I ran away as fast as I could.

820
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:41,800
Where were you going, Clarice?

821
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:44,980
I don't know. I didn't have any food, any water...

822
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:47,840
and it was very cold. It was very cold.

823
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:51,240
I thought...

824
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:54,690
I thought if I could save just one...

825
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:58,260
but he was so heavy.

826
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:00,890
He was so heavy.

827
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:10,070
I didn't get more than a few miles when the sheriffs car picked me up.

828
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:17,540
The rancher was so angry he sent me to a Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman.

829
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:20,280
I never saw the ranch again.

830
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:23,740
What became of your lamb, Clarice?

831
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:27,010
They killed him.

832
01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:29,650
You still wake up sometimes, don't you?

833
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:31,580
Wake up in the dark...

834
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:35,090
and hear the screaming of the lambs?

835
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:36,850
Yes.

836
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:41,100
And you think if you save poor Catherine...

837
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,890
you can make them stop, don't you? You think if Catherine lives...

838
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:48,330
you won't wake up in the dark ever again...

839
01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:51,340
to that awful screaming of the lambs.

840
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:53,910
I don't know.

841
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:55,980
I don't know.

842
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:00,080
Thank you, Clarice.

843
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:01,860
Thank you.

844
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:04,090
Tell me his name, doctor.

845
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,360
Dr. Chilton, I presume.

846
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:15,540
I think you know each other.

847
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:19,340
Okay.

848
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,100
- We found her. - Let's go.

849
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:24,000
It's your turn, doctor.

850
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:26,070
- Out! - Tell me his name.

851
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:29,110
Sorry, ma'am, I've got orders to put you on a plane.

852
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:30,540
Come on, now.

853
01:13:30,890 --> 01:13:32,680
Brave Clarice.

854
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:36,650
You will let me know when those lambs stop screaming, won't you?

855
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,650
Tell me his name, doctor!

856
01:13:38,990 --> 01:13:40,220
Clarice!

857
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:43,320
Your case file.

858
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:46,160
Hey!

859
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,800
Goodbye, Clarice.

860
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:57,700
Ready when you are, doc.

861
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,260
Just another minute, please.

862
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:11,520
Son of a bitch demanded a second dinner.

863
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:13,510
Lamb chops, extra rare.

864
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:18,320
Wonder what he wants for breakfast? Some damn thing from the zoo?

865
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:41,380
Good evening, gentlemen.

866
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:43,510
Okay, doc. Grab some floor.

867
01:15:43,850 --> 01:15:45,840
Same drill as before, please.

868
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:54,960
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

869
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:12,740
Okay.

870
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:20,850
Hand me that, would you?

871
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:27,750
Thanks.

872
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:33,600
Mind the drawings, please.

873
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:37,970
Thank you.

874
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:05,070
Pembry, watch it, he's cuffed me!

875
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,200
Jesus Christ!

876
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,450
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

877
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,760
What is this shit?

878
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,960
Did somebody go up on five?

879
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:53,970
- No, nobody went up. - Call Pembry. Ask him to tell...

880
01:18:57,010 --> 01:19:01,000
CP, shots fired on five. Repeat, shots fired on five.

881
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,510
Sergeant Tate!

882
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:04,710
Proceed. Shots fired on five.

883
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:06,940
Holy shit!

884
01:19:07,290 --> 01:19:08,950
- What the hell? - Bitch!

885
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:10,290
Shut up!

886
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:11,780
Bobby, get the vest.

887
01:19:12,090 --> 01:19:13,460
Right, sarge.

888
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:15,950
- Brady, Howard, cover... - Look!

889
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:20,300
It stopped.

890
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:23,230
Seal off a 10-block radius.

891
01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:26,370
Get me the SWAT team and an ambulance, double quick.

892
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:27,800
We're going up.

893
01:19:56,940 --> 01:19:58,340
Pembry?!

894
01:19:59,910 --> 01:20:01,270
Boyle?!

895
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:15,650
Oh, God!

896
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:23,890
Go.

897
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:33,070
- Clear. - Clear.

898
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:34,670
Command post.

899
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:36,610
Two officers down.

900
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:38,310
- Clear! - Clear!

901
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:39,970
Lecter's gone, sarge.

902
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:41,940
Prisoner is missing.

903
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:43,650
Boyle's gun is gone.

904
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:46,490
Repeat. Lecter is missing and armed.

905
01:20:46,790 --> 01:20:48,450
He stripped the bed.

906
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:51,650
Might be making a rope. Check all the windows.

907
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:54,190
Where the fuck is my ambulance?

908
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,130
He's alive.

909
01:20:56,330 --> 01:20:59,030
Sergeant Tate! He's alive!

910
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:02,590
Get ahold of him and feel his hands. Talk to him!

911
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,170
What do I say?

912
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:07,200
It's Jim Pembry. Now talk to him, damn it!

913
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,440
Lecter is missing and armed.

914
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:14,410
- Pembry. Pembry, can you hear me? - He took Boyle's gun.

915
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:17,750
Pembry got off one round. There's a chance Lecter's hit.

916
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:19,780
Keep breathing in and out.

917
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:23,590
You're doing a good job. You look real good there.

918
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:27,090
Yeah, you look... Look real good.

919
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:45,410
- You ready? - Let's go!

920
01:21:45,410 --> 01:21:47,110
- Let's do it. - Okay, let's go!

921
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,620
Looking good. You're gonna make it.

922
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:02,730
Everything's just fine.

923
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:05,220
- I need that IV now! - Lactated Ringer's.

924
01:22:05,530 --> 01:22:07,800
Can we get the strap? Where's the oxygen?

925
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:11,700
Doing good, buddy. That's right. Stay with me here.

926
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:15,800
We're losing him! Downstairs, quickly!

927
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:17,640
And up!

928
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:19,970
- Elevator! - This way!

929
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:22,770
- Out of the way! - Get out of the way!

930
01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:28,150
CP to Tate.

931
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:31,150
Roger, lieutenant. Tate here.

932
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:34,020
I'm on the elevator bringing Pembry down.

933
01:22:34,630 --> 01:22:36,430
He seems to be hanging on.

934
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:39,320
Top three floors secured.

935
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:41,930
Main stairwell secured.

936
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:44,700
We think he's on two.

937
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:00,210
Tate, you still with me?

938
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:04,290
We're pretty sure he's somewhere on two, sir.

939
01:23:04,490 --> 01:23:06,290
That's all for now. Over.

940
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:28,350
He's on the roof of the elevator.

941
01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:32,380
Okay, guys.

942
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:49,930
I see him.

943
01:23:50,570 --> 01:23:52,840
There's a gun by his hand. He's not moving.

944
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:56,400
- One warning. We need him alive. - Got it.

945
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:58,800
Lecter?

946
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:00,980
Put your hands on your head.

947
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,850
One in the leg.

948
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:17,460
No movement.

949
01:24:18,830 --> 01:24:21,390
Johnny, hold your fire. We're coming into the car.

950
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,490
We're opening the hatch.

951
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:25,300
Watch his hands.

952
01:24:25,670 --> 01:24:28,440
If there's any fire, it'll come from us. Affirm.

953
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:29,780
Got it.

954
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,770
Memphis General, this is Unit 26.

955
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:00,610
We're inbound with a 50-year-old male officer...

956
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:02,930
with severe facial lacerations.

957
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:06,510
He had grand mal seizure activity. He's postdictal now.

958
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:08,640
- I copy. - Vital signs are good.

959
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:10,470
- Pressure is 130l90. - Ninety?

960
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:12,880
Yeah, that's right, 90. Pulse, 84.

961
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:15,450
We got him on lactated Ringer's running...

962
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,950
and the patient is on 10 liters of oxygen.

963
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:20,250
Watch it!

964
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:27,960
The ambulance was found in a parking garage at Memphis Airport.

965
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:29,670
The crew was dead.

966
01:25:30,870 --> 01:25:32,360
He killed a tourist too.

967
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:34,400
Got his clothes, cash.

968
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:36,600
By now he could be anywhere.

969
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:38,810
- He won't come after me. - Oh, really?

970
01:25:39,180 --> 01:25:40,200
He won't.

971
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:42,370
I can't explain it.

972
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:44,880
He would consider that rude.

973
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:47,110
It's over. She's dead.

974
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:48,980
It's not your fault.

975
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:53,820
Lecter said everything we need to catch him with is here, only I can't...

976
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,790
Dr. Lecter said a lot of things.

977
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:57,820
He's here, Ardelia.

978
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:29,360
Is this Lecter's handwriting?

979
01:26:31,570 --> 01:26:35,830
"Doesn't this random scattering of sites seem desperately random?

980
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:39,770
Like the elaboration of a bad liar? Ta. Hannibal Lecter."

981
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:43,010
"Desperately random." What does he mean?

982
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:46,110
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's a pattern here.

983
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:50,510
But there's no pattern or the computers would've nailed it.

984
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:53,120
They're even found in random order.

985
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:57,120
Random because of the one girl. The one he weighted down.

986
01:26:57,730 --> 01:26:59,450
- Fredrica Bimmel. - Right.

987
01:26:59,830 --> 01:27:03,060
From Belvedere, Ohio.

988
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:06,800
The first girl taken, third body found. Why?

989
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:09,160
She didn't drift. He weighted her down.

990
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:12,700
What did Lecter say about the "first principles"?

991
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:14,470
Simplicity.

992
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:17,940
What does this guy do? He covets.

993
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:20,610
How do we first start to covet?

994
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:22,510
We covet what we see.

995
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:24,340
Every day.

996
01:27:26,490 --> 01:27:27,610
Hot damn, Clarice.

997
01:27:28,190 --> 01:27:29,350
He knew her.

998
01:28:44,870 --> 01:28:46,130
Mr. Bimmel?

999
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:47,590
That's me.

1000
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:50,560
Hello, I'm Clarice Starling. I'm with the FBI.

1001
01:28:54,610 --> 01:28:57,770
I appreciate you letting me take a look around, Mr. Bimmel.

1002
01:28:58,350 --> 01:29:00,370
I don't know nothing new to tell you.

1003
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:03,480
Police been back here so many times already.

1004
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:08,080
Fredrica went into Chicago on the bus to see about a job.

1005
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,220
She left the interview okay.

1006
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:11,820
She never come home.

1007
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,850
Her bedroom's how she left it.

1008
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:18,230
Upstairs.

1009
01:29:19,070 --> 01:29:20,430
Door to the left.

1010
01:32:05,630 --> 01:32:09,120
He's making himself a woman suit. Out of real women!

1011
01:32:09,470 --> 01:32:10,460
And he can sew!

1012
01:32:10,740 --> 01:32:13,570
He's very skilled. He's a tailor or a dressmaker or...

1013
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:15,570
- Starling! - That's why they're big.

1014
01:32:15,910 --> 01:32:18,040
He keeps them alive so he can starve them...

1015
01:32:18,350 --> 01:32:19,680
loosen their skin and...

1016
01:32:19,980 --> 01:32:22,380
Starling! We know who and where he is!

1017
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:24,080
We're on our way right now.

1018
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:27,150
- Where? - Calumet City, edge of Chicago.

1019
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,990
Be on the ground in 45 minutes with HRT.

1020
01:32:30,290 --> 01:32:32,380
That's great news, sir. But how...?

1021
01:32:32,690 --> 01:32:36,150
We fed the names Johns Hopkins came up with into Known Offenders.

1022
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:40,260
Subject's name is Jamie Gumb, a.k.a. John Grant.

1023
01:32:40,630 --> 01:32:44,200
Lecter's description was accurate. He just lied about the name.

1024
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:45,870
Customs had some paper on him.

1025
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:49,840
They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX.

1026
01:32:50,110 --> 01:32:52,100
Live caterpillars from Suriname.

1027
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:55,210
The addressee was a Jame Gumb.

1028
01:32:55,950 --> 01:32:58,680
Chicago is only 400 miles from here. I'll be there in...

1029
01:32:59,050 --> 01:33:00,610
No, there's not enough time.

1030
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:03,050
We want him for murder, not kidnapping.

1031
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,520
Link him to Bimmel before he's indicted.

1032
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:09,790
- See what you can find in Belvedere. - Yes, sir. You bet. I'll do my best.

1033
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:11,160
Starling.

1034
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:15,160
We wouldn't have found him without you. Nobody will forget that.

1035
01:33:16,070 --> 01:33:17,540
Least of all me.

1036
01:33:18,740 --> 01:33:19,800
Thank you, sir.

1037
01:33:20,110 --> 01:33:22,340
Thank you very much, Mr. Crawford.

1038
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:25,040
Mr. Crawford?

1039
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:39,850
Thanks for the scraps, asshole.

1040
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:42,020
I got a better idea.

1041
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:06,070
Okay, Precious. Time for a little treat.

1042
01:34:19,170 --> 01:34:20,530
Precious!

1043
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,630
Come on, girl!

1044
01:34:25,770 --> 01:34:28,170
Come on, Precious. Come on, Precious.

1045
01:34:37,550 --> 01:34:39,140
Come on, Precious.

1046
01:34:39,490 --> 01:34:42,180
I got a yummy, yummy snack for you.

1047
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:43,720
Come and get it!

1048
01:34:50,830 --> 01:34:52,160
Precious!

1049
01:34:53,070 --> 01:34:55,660
Are you up there, you little shit?

1050
01:34:56,370 --> 01:34:58,560
Come and get it, pretty girl.

1051
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:06,770
Precious!

1052
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:09,140
Please come. Come on.

1053
01:35:17,060 --> 01:35:18,850
Come on, Precious.

1054
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:32,270
Would you fuck me?

1055
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:35,640
Come on. Take that bone. Come on.

1056
01:35:36,510 --> 01:35:39,100
Come on. Come on! Come on!

1057
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:40,840
I'd fuck me.

1058
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:42,580
Come on.

1059
01:35:47,050 --> 01:35:51,510
I'd fuck me hard. I'd fuck me so hard.

1060
01:35:55,830 --> 01:35:56,990
No!

1061
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:47,480
伊利諾斯州芝加哥市

1062
01:36:58,120 --> 01:37:01,860
Is that a good job, FBI agent? You get to travel around and stuff?

1063
01:37:02,230 --> 01:37:04,290
I mean, better places than this?

1064
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:07,670
Sometimes you do.

1065
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:12,870
Freddie was so happy for me when I got this job at the bank.

1066
01:37:13,170 --> 01:37:16,940
Toaster giveaways and Barry Manilow on the speakers all day.

1067
01:37:17,310 --> 01:37:19,780
She thought it was such hot shit.

1068
01:37:20,310 --> 01:37:22,510
What did she know? Big dummy.

1069
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:26,880
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb?

1070
01:37:27,190 --> 01:37:28,710
Or a Jame Gumb?

1071
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:31,780
- How about John Grant? - No.

1072
01:37:32,090 --> 01:37:34,320
Would she have had a friend you didn't know?

1073
01:37:34,630 --> 01:37:37,100
No way. If she had a guy, I'd have known.

1074
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:38,860
Sewing was her life.

1075
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:41,170
Did you ever work together?

1076
01:37:41,470 --> 01:37:46,060
Me and Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman.

1077
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:50,180
Can I get Mrs. Lippman's address? I need to talk to her.

1078
01:38:18,410 --> 01:38:20,000
So powerful.

1079
01:38:20,370 --> 01:38:21,860
So beautiful.

1080
01:38:27,110 --> 01:38:28,410
Precious?

1081
01:38:34,390 --> 01:38:35,220
Precious?

1082
01:38:35,590 --> 01:38:37,560
Down here, you sack of shit!

1083
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:47,700
- Put her in that bucket. - No!

1084
01:38:48,030 --> 01:38:50,730
You get me a telephone and lower it down here, now!

1085
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:57,840
Oh, poodlie-poo. Precious? Darling, are you all right?

1086
01:38:58,210 --> 01:39:01,040
She's in a lot of pain, mister. She needs a vet.

1087
01:39:05,550 --> 01:39:08,040
She broke her leg on the way down. She's licking...

1088
01:39:08,390 --> 01:39:10,220
Hey! Don't you hurt my dog!

1089
01:39:10,590 --> 01:39:12,320
Don't you make me hurt your dog!

1090
01:39:12,690 --> 01:39:14,750
You don't know what pain is!

1091
01:39:20,270 --> 01:39:23,720
Get me that telephone or I'll kill him!

1092
01:39:28,410 --> 01:39:32,540
- Oh, fuck! - You better get me that telephone!

1093
01:39:32,850 --> 01:39:34,840
I'm gonna do it, mister!!

1094
01:39:35,150 --> 01:39:39,140
I'm gonna snap her neck off, I swear to God!

1095
01:39:39,690 --> 01:39:41,520
All right, mister. I'm doing it!

1096
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:07,410
Okay, I'm coming.

1097
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:10,180
We're going in.

1098
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:17,250
Good afternoon. Sorry to bother you.

1099
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:19,750
I'm looking for Mrs. Lippman's family.

1100
01:40:20,530 --> 01:40:22,520
FBI! Everybody down!

1101
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:25,360
Lippmans don't live here anymore.

1102
01:40:25,730 --> 01:40:28,060
Excuse me, sir. I need to speak with you.

1103
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:30,990
- Clear! - Clear!

1104
01:40:31,970 --> 01:40:33,940
What's the problem, officer?

1105
01:40:34,210 --> 01:40:36,800
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel.

1106
01:40:40,210 --> 01:40:41,510
There's no one here, Jack.

1107
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:45,580
Clarice.

1108
01:40:45,850 --> 01:40:46,840
Your name is...?

1109
01:40:47,150 --> 01:40:48,180
Oh, Jack Gordon.

1110
01:40:48,490 --> 01:40:50,180
Mr. Gordon. Good.

1111
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:53,720
Fredrica worked for Mrs. Lippman. Did you know her?

1112
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:56,320
No, uh-uh.

1113
01:40:57,030 --> 01:40:58,360
Oh, wait.

1114
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,890
Was she a great big fat person?

1115
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:03,390
Yes, she was a big girl, sir.

1116
01:41:03,740 --> 01:41:05,100
Yeah, I may have...

1117
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:07,800
No, I read about her in the newspaper.

1118
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:12,040
Mrs. Lippman had a son. Maybe he could help.

1119
01:41:12,350 --> 01:41:13,940
I got his card in here.

1120
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:15,410
You want to come in?

1121
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:16,700
- May I? - Yeah, sure.

1122
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:18,070
Thank you.

1123
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:39,030
Are you close to catching somebody?

1124
01:41:40,870 --> 01:41:41,700
Yes.

1125
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:43,170
We may be.

1126
01:41:45,110 --> 01:41:46,200
Did you...

1127
01:41:47,250 --> 01:41:50,710
take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died, is that right?

1128
01:41:52,150 --> 01:41:56,380
Yeah, I bought this house two years ago.

1129
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:00,990
Did she leave any records, any business records...

1130
01:42:01,290 --> 01:42:04,990
tax forms, lists of employees?

1131
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:07,560
No, nothing like that at all.

1132
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:12,700
Say, has the FBI learned something?

1133
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:16,340
The police around here don't seem to have the first clue.

1134
01:42:26,020 --> 01:42:30,580
Have you got, like, a description, fingerprints, anything like that?

1135
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:33,130
No.

1136
01:42:35,830 --> 01:42:37,060
No, we don't.

1137
01:42:48,540 --> 01:42:49,870
Here's that number.

1138
01:42:51,510 --> 01:42:53,040
Very good, Mr. Gordon.

1139
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:55,040
May I use your phone, please?

1140
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:05,320
Sure you can use my phone.

1141
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:07,950
Freeze!

1142
01:43:08,900 --> 01:43:12,890
Put your hands over your head and turn around. Spread your legs.

1143
01:43:14,130 --> 01:43:15,330
Spread your legs!

1144
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:17,230
Put your hands in the back...

1145
01:43:17,570 --> 01:43:18,900
Freeze!

1146
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:33,480
Hey!

1147
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:55,830
Are you there?

1148
01:44:57,340 --> 01:45:00,360
I'm down here! I'm down here!

1149
01:45:19,660 --> 01:45:21,150
Catherine Martin?

1150
01:45:21,490 --> 01:45:22,760
Yes!

1151
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:25,720
FBI.

1152
01:45:26,030 --> 01:45:27,230
You're safe.

1153
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:30,330
Safe, shit! Get me out of here!

1154
01:45:45,650 --> 01:45:47,350
You're all right. Where is he?

1155
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:50,520
How the fuck should I know? Just get me out of here!

1156
01:45:50,890 --> 01:45:53,950
Catherine, you've gotta be quiet! Now, shut that dog up!

1157
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:56,250
Just get me out of here!

1158
01:45:57,430 --> 01:45:58,490
Oh, my God.

1159
01:46:01,030 --> 01:46:05,050
Catherine, I'm gonna get you out. But right now, you listen to me.

1160
01:46:05,260 --> 01:46:07,230
I've gotta leave. I'll be right back

1161
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:11,370
No! Don't you leave me here, you fucking bitch! No!

1162
01:46:11,510 --> 01:46:12,980
Don't you leave me here!

1163
01:46:13,250 --> 01:46:15,840
This guy is fucking crazy!

1164
01:46:18,350 --> 01:46:23,050
Wait! I gotta get out of here!

1165
01:46:24,690 --> 01:46:25,520
Please!

1166
01:46:25,890 --> 01:46:30,450
Catherine! The other officers will be here any minute now.

1167
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:34,390
Wait! Don't go! Please!

1168
01:46:34,730 --> 01:46:35,930
Quiet!

1169
01:46:38,340 --> 01:46:40,810
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1170
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:39,210
- You okay? - Gunpowder. It's nothing, I'm okay.

1171
01:50:39,510 --> 01:50:42,480
Agent Starling, how did you track Buffalo Bill here?

1172
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:51,580
Clarice M. Starling.

1173
01:50:53,890 --> 01:50:55,090
Congratulations.

1174
01:51:08,710 --> 01:51:11,340
Ernest W. Stevens.

1175
01:51:29,230 --> 01:51:30,960
Special Agent Starling!

1176
01:51:31,530 --> 01:51:33,290
- Special Agent Mapp. - Phone call.

1177
01:51:33,670 --> 01:51:34,890
Thank you. Excuse me.

1178
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:36,360
Starling.

1179
01:51:39,310 --> 01:51:42,000
Pilch, could you take our picture?

1180
01:51:42,410 --> 01:51:43,400
Sure.

1181
01:51:45,410 --> 01:51:47,470
I just wanted to say congratulations.

1182
01:51:47,910 --> 01:51:51,350
I'm no good at this kind of thing, so I'm gonna duck out of here.

1183
01:51:51,950 --> 01:51:53,440
Okay. Sure.

1184
01:51:55,090 --> 01:51:56,610
Thank you, Mr. Crawford.

1185
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:06,690
Your father would've been proud today.

1186
01:52:10,100 --> 01:52:11,690
Don't forget your phone call.

1187
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:17,740
Starling.

1188
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:19,540
Well, Clarice...

1189
01:52:20,210 --> 01:52:22,610
have the lambs stopped screaming?

1190
01:52:23,150 --> 01:52:24,210
Dr. Lecter?

1191
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:27,450
Don't bother with a trace. I won't be on long enough.

1192
01:52:31,020 --> 01:52:33,080
Where are you, Dr. Lecter?

1193
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:35,050
I have no plans to call on you.

1194
01:52:35,430 --> 01:52:37,790
The world's more interesting with you in it.

1195
01:52:38,430 --> 01:52:41,260
So you take care now to extend me the same courtesy.

1196
01:52:41,630 --> 01:52:44,100
You know I can't make that promise.

1197
01:52:44,670 --> 01:52:46,930
I do wish we could chat longer...

1198
01:52:48,340 --> 01:52:50,900
but I'm having an old friend for dinner.

1199
01:52:52,510 --> 01:52:53,670
Bye.

1200
01:52:54,250 --> 01:52:55,470
Dr. Lecter!

1201
01:52:58,080 --> 01:52:59,410
Dr. Lecter.

1202
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:03,090
Dr. Lecter.

1203
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:06,590
Dr. Lecter?

1204
01:53:07,730 --> 01:53:09,020
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1205
01:53:09,330 --> 01:53:10,850
The security system's set up?

1206
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:13,720
- We have the big shot security. - I appreciate it.
