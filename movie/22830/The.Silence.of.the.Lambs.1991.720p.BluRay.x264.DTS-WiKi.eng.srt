1
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:38,838


2
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,258
Starling!

3
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:57,138
Crawford wants to see you in his office.

4
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,203
Thank you, sir.

5
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,207


6
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,408


7
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,609


8
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:09,947


9
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,792
-Clarice. -Hey.

10
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,490


11
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,008
Looking for Crawford?

12
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:44,411
He should be back soon. Why don't you wait in his office?

13
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:39,963


14
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,074
Starling.

15
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:47,244
-Clarice M. Good morning. -Morning, Mr. Crawford.

16
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,746
Sorry to pull you off the course at such short notice.

17
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,885
Your instructors say you're in the top quarter of your class.

18
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:57,416
l hope so. They haven't posted any grades yet.

19
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,190
A job's come up, and l thought about you.

20
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,021
Not a job, really, more of an interesting errand.

21
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,422
Sit down.

22
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:05,986
Yes, sir.

23
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,460
l remember you from my seminar at UVA.

24
00:06:12,303 --> 00:06:15,670
You grilled me on the bureau's civil rights record in the Hoover years.

25
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:16,863
l gave you an A.

26
00:06:17,342 --> 00:06:18,468
A minus, sir.

27
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,407
Double major, psych and criminology, graduated magna.

28
00:06:24,616 --> 00:06:27,380
Summer internships at the Reitzinger Clinic.

29
00:06:27,585 --> 00:06:32,352
lt says when you graduate you want to work for me in Behavioral Science.

30
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:34,615
Yes, very much, sir. Very much.

31
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:38,628
We're interviewing all serial killers in custody...

32
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,661
...for a psycho-behavioral profile.

33
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:43,659
lt could be a real help in unsolved cases.

34
00:06:43,868 --> 00:06:46,428
Most of them have been happy to talk to us.

35
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:48,563
Do you spook easily, Starling?

36
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:50,703
Not yet, sir.

37
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:53,804
The one we want most refuses to help.

38
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:56,446
l want you to go after him in the asylum.

39
00:06:56,948 --> 00:06:58,279
Who's the subject?

40
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,953
-The psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter. -''Hannibal the Cannibal.''

41
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:05,748
l don't expect him to talk to you...

42
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:09,959
...but l have to be able to say we tried.

43
00:07:10,328 --> 00:07:13,126
lf he won't cooperate, l want straight reporting.

44
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:15,162
How's he look? How's his cell?

45
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:18,927
ls he sketching, drawing? lf he is, what's he sketching?

46
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:25,436
Here's a dossier on Lecter...

47
00:07:27,645 --> 00:07:30,614
...copy of our questionnaire and an l.D. for you.

48
00:07:31,282 --> 00:07:33,807
Have your memo on my desk by 0800, Wednesday.

49
00:07:34,018 --> 00:07:35,178
Okay.

50
00:07:37,755 --> 00:07:40,781
Excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?

51
00:07:40,992 --> 00:07:42,721
Lecter's been in prison for years.

52
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:46,021
ls there some connection between him and Buffalo Bill?

53
00:07:46,231 --> 00:07:50,065
l wish there were. Now, l want your full attention, Starling.

54
00:07:51,202 --> 00:07:54,694
-Yes, sir. -Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.

55
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:59,336
Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over all the physical procedures used.

56
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:03,439
Do not deviate from them for any reason whatsoever.

57
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:05,707
You're to tell him nothing personal.

58
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:09,320
You don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head.

59
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:12,683
Just do your job but never forget what he is.

60
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:14,250
And what is that?

61
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:18,623
Oh, he's a monster, a pure psychopath.

62
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:21,222
lt's so rare to capture one alive.

63
00:08:21,432 --> 00:08:25,459
From a research point of view, Lecter is our most prized asset.

64
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:31,365
We get a lot of detectives here...

65
00:08:31,576 --> 00:08:34,841
...but l must say l can't remember one as attractive.

66
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:39,881
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?

67
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:43,850
Because this can be quite a fun town if you have the right guide.

68
00:08:45,256 --> 00:08:48,623
l'm sure this is a great town, Dr. Chilton...

69
00:08:48,826 --> 00:08:52,694
...but l must talk to Dr. Lecter and report back this afternoon.

70
00:08:53,064 --> 00:08:56,465
l see. Well, let's make this quick, then.

71
00:08:56,768 --> 00:09:01,228
We've tried to study him, but he's too sophisticated for the standard tests.

72
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,669
Oh, my, does he hate us.

73
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,968
He thinks l'm his nemesis.

74
00:09:07,545 --> 00:09:10,173
Crawford's very clever, isn't he, using you?

75
00:09:10,481 --> 00:09:14,781
-What do you mean, sir? -Pretty young woman to turn him on.

76
00:09:15,286 --> 00:09:20,223
l don't believe Lecter's seen a woman in eight years, and you are his taste.

77
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:21,923
So to speak.

78
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:25,061
l graduated from UVA. lt's not a charm school.

79
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:28,528
Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.

80
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:35,270
Do not touch or approach the glass. Pass him nothing but soft paper.

81
00:09:35,473 --> 00:09:39,204
No pencils or pens, no staples or paper clips in his paper.

82
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,742
Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions.

83
00:09:41,946 --> 00:09:44,141
lf he passes you anything, do not accept.

84
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:46,817
-Do you understand? -Yes, l understand, sir.

85
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:51,379
l'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions.

86
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:54,057
On the afternoon of July 8, 1 981 ...

87
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:57,160
...he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary.

88
00:09:57,362 --> 00:09:59,830
His mouthpiece was removed for an EKG.

89
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:03,023
When the nurse leaned over him, he did this to her.

90
00:10:05,803 --> 00:10:10,206
The doctors managed to reset her jaw, more or less. Save one of her eyes.

91
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:15,304
His pulse never got above 85, even when he ate her tongue.

92
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:19,447
-l keep him in here. -Dr. Chilton.

93
00:10:22,086 --> 00:10:25,613
lf Lecter feels that you're his enemy, then....

94
00:10:25,823 --> 00:10:28,223
Maybe we'll have more luck if l go by myself.

95
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,924
What do you think?

96
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,561
You might have suggested this in my office and saved me the time.

97
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:42,030
Yes, sir, but then l would have missed the pleasure of your company, sir.

98
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:47,244
When she's finished, bring her out.

99
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:20,401
Hi, l'm Barney. He told you, don't get near the glass?

100
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:22,877
Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.

101
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:26,741
Nice to meet you. You can hang your coat there if you like.

102
00:11:26,951 --> 00:11:29,146
Okay. Thank you, l will.

103
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:33,782
He's past the others. The last cell.

104
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:35,754
You keep to the right.

105
00:11:38,162 --> 00:11:41,598
-l put out a chair for you. -Yes, that's very good, thank you.

106
00:11:43,468 --> 00:11:46,904
l'll be watching. You'll do fine.

107
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:19,092
l can smell your cunt.

108
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:34,206
Good morning.

109
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:38,987
Dr. Lecter, my name is Clarice Starling. May l speak with you?

110
00:12:38,987 --> 00:12:41,319
You're one of Jack Crawford's, aren't you?

111
00:12:41,757 --> 00:12:42,883
l am, yes.

112
00:12:44,126 --> 00:12:46,026
May l see your credentials?

113
00:12:46,695 --> 00:12:47,684
Certainly.

114
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:56,528
Closer, please.

115
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,964
Closer.

116
00:13:15,957 --> 00:13:20,451
That expires in one week. You're not real FBl, are you?

117
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:23,397
l'm still in training at the academy.

118
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:29,536
-Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me? -Yes, l'm a student.

119
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:31,762
l'm here to learn from you.

120
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:35,170
Maybe you can decide if l'm qualified enough to do that.

121
00:13:38,613 --> 00:13:41,707
That is rather slippery of you, Agent Starling.

122
00:13:45,253 --> 00:13:46,914
Sit. Please.

123
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:58,288
Now then, tell me. What did Miggs say to you?

124
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,094
''Multiple Miggs'' in the next cell.

125
00:14:01,303 --> 00:14:04,431
He hissed at you. What did he say?

126
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:08,776
He said, ''l can smell your cunt.''

127
00:14:09,144 --> 00:14:10,406
l see.

128
00:14:11,747 --> 00:14:13,772
l myself cannot.

129
00:14:22,824 --> 00:14:25,486
You use Evyan skin cream.

130
00:14:27,963 --> 00:14:30,898
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps.

131
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,824
But not today.

132
00:14:36,104 --> 00:14:37,901
Did you do all these drawings?

133
00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:44,343
That is the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere.

134
00:14:45,714 --> 00:14:47,375
Do you know Florence?

135
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,318
All that detail just from memory, sir?

136
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:55,113
Memory, Agent Starling, is what l have instead of a view.

137
00:14:55,824 --> 00:15:00,420
Perhaps you'd care to lend us your view on this questionnaire, sir.

138
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:05,066
No, no, no. You were doing fine.

139
00:15:05,267 --> 00:15:08,259
You had been courteous and receptive to courtesy.

140
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,930
You had established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs.

141
00:15:13,175 --> 00:15:17,805
And now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire.

142
00:15:19,047 --> 00:15:20,412
lt won't do.

143
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:24,752
l'm only asking you to look at this. Either you will or you won't.

144
00:15:24,986 --> 00:15:28,615
Yeah. Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed...

145
00:15:28,824 --> 00:15:31,349
...if he's recruiting help from the student body.

146
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,422
Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill.

147
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:36,927
What a naughty boy he is.

148
00:15:37,332 --> 00:15:40,597
Do you know why he's called ''Buffalo Bill''?

149
00:15:40,802 --> 00:15:44,135
Please tell me. The newspapers won't say.

150
00:15:45,307 --> 00:15:47,605
lt started as a joke in Kansas City Homicide.

151
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:52,041
They said, ''This one likes to skin his humps.''

152
00:15:53,381 --> 00:15:54,678
Why do you think...

153
00:15:54,883 --> 00:15:58,683
...he removes their skins, Agent Starling?

154
00:15:58,887 --> 00:16:01,151
Thrill me with your acumen.

155
00:16:01,923 --> 00:16:03,515
lt excites him.

156
00:16:03,725 --> 00:16:06,785
Most serial killers keep trophies from their victims.

157
00:16:07,562 --> 00:16:09,689
-l didn't. -No.

158
00:16:10,098 --> 00:16:11,565
No, you ate yours.

159
00:16:14,402 --> 00:16:16,336
You send that through now.

160
00:16:43,465 --> 00:16:47,834
You think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?

161
00:16:48,637 --> 00:16:51,435
No! l thought that your knowledge--

162
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,938
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

163
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:57,936
You know what you look like, with your good bag and your cheap shoes?

164
00:16:58,146 --> 00:16:59,579
You look like a rube.

165
00:17:00,248 --> 00:17:04,378
A well-scrubbed, hustling rube with a little taste.

166
00:17:05,186 --> 00:17:07,416
Nutrition has given you some length of bone...

167
00:17:07,622 --> 00:17:10,785
...but you're not more than one generation from white trash...

168
00:17:10,992 --> 00:17:12,823
...are you, Agent Starling?

169
00:17:13,028 --> 00:17:15,826
The accent you've tried so desperately to shed...

170
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,090
...pure West Virginia.

171
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,359
ls your father a coal miner?

172
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:22,298
Does he stink of the lamp?

173
00:17:22,637 --> 00:17:27,370
l know how quickly the boys found you, all those tedious, sticky fumblings...

174
00:17:27,576 --> 00:17:31,012
...in the back seats of cars, while you dreamed of getting out.

175
00:17:31,212 --> 00:17:32,577
Getting anywhere.

176
00:17:32,847 --> 00:17:36,408
Getting all the way to the FBl.

177
00:17:39,721 --> 00:17:42,519
You see a lot, doctor.

178
00:17:42,724 --> 00:17:45,192
But are you strong enough to point that...

179
00:17:45,393 --> 00:17:47,918
...high-powered perception at yourself?

180
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,056
What about it?

181
00:17:50,265 --> 00:17:54,429
Why don't you look at yourself and write down what you see?

182
00:17:54,636 --> 00:17:56,365
Or maybe you're afraid to.

183
00:18:06,147 --> 00:18:09,014
A census taker once tried to test me.

184
00:18:09,217 --> 00:18:12,550
l ate his liver with some fava beans...

185
00:18:12,754 --> 00:18:15,052
...and a nice Chianti.

186
00:18:23,865 --> 00:18:26,231
You fly back to school now, little Starling.

187
00:18:27,135 --> 00:18:28,625
Fly, fly, fly.

188
00:18:43,618 --> 00:18:45,518
l bit my wrist...

189
00:18:45,754 --> 00:18:49,190
...so l could die.

190
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,452
Look at the blood!

191
00:18:51,392 --> 00:18:52,791
Gotcha.

192
00:18:53,194 --> 00:18:55,287
Miggs! You stupid fuck!

193
00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:03,669
Agent Starling! Come back! Agent Starling! Agent Starling!

194
00:19:03,871 --> 00:19:06,965
l would not have had that happen. Discourtesy is ugly to me.

195
00:19:07,175 --> 00:19:09,609
-Then do this test! -No, but l will make you happy.

196
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:12,336
-l'll give you a chance at your love. -What?

197
00:19:12,547 --> 00:19:17,314
Advancement. Listen. Look deep within yourself, Clarice Starling.

198
00:19:17,518 --> 00:19:21,716
Go seek out Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T.

199
00:19:22,023 --> 00:19:24,548
l don't think Miggs could manage again so soon...

200
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:26,989
...even though he is crazy. Go now!

201
00:20:08,503 --> 00:20:09,697
Hi, Bill.

202
00:20:14,475 --> 00:20:16,204
-Daddy! -Hey, Clarice.

203
00:20:20,448 --> 00:20:23,975
-Did you get any bad guys, Daddy? -No, angel. They all got away.

204
00:20:24,185 --> 00:20:25,675
Ah, shoot.

205
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,304
FBl! Hands up! Don't move!

206
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:52,036
Turn around. Hands behind your back. Thumbs up.

207
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,847
You're dead, Starling.

208
00:20:58,386 --> 00:21:02,516
Johnson, good entry, good command. Starling, where's your danger area?

209
00:21:02,723 --> 00:21:04,122
-ln the corner. -Did you check it?

210
00:21:04,325 --> 00:21:05,917
-No, sir. -That's why you're dead.

211
00:21:06,227 --> 00:21:09,253
3-1 -0-9?

212
00:21:09,464 --> 00:21:13,901
Breaking doors or windows to enter or exit.

213
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:16,131
Rule 404?

214
00:21:19,273 --> 00:21:21,002


215
00:21:22,543 --> 00:21:24,602


216
00:21:30,017 --> 00:21:31,917


217
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:37,321
Clarice, phone. lt's the guru.

218
00:21:37,525 --> 00:21:39,152
Crawford? Thanks, Ardelia.

219
00:21:39,627 --> 00:21:42,061
-Starling? -Sir.

220
00:21:42,263 --> 00:21:43,696
Miggs is dead.

221
00:21:44,866 --> 00:21:45,855
Dead?

222
00:21:46,734 --> 00:21:47,962
How?

223
00:21:48,703 --> 00:21:51,763
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him all afternoon.

224
00:21:51,973 --> 00:21:54,567
They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his tongue.

225
00:21:57,612 --> 00:21:58,704
Starling?

226
00:21:59,247 --> 00:22:02,273
Yeah. l'm still here, sir. l just--

227
00:22:02,483 --> 00:22:04,212
l don't know how to feel about this.

228
00:22:04,785 --> 00:22:08,221
You don't have to feel any way. Lecter did it to amuse himself.

229
00:22:09,557 --> 00:22:11,491
Look, l know it got ugly today...

230
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:16,360
...but you mentioned a name, ''Mofet.'' Any follow-up on her?

231
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:21,162
He destroyed most of his patients' histories prior to capture...

232
00:22:21,369 --> 00:22:24,861
...so there's no record of anyone named Mofet.

233
00:22:25,072 --> 00:22:29,168
But l thought the ''yourself' reference was too hokey for Lecter...

234
00:22:29,377 --> 00:22:33,541
...so l figured he's from Baltimore, and l looked in the phone book.

235
00:22:33,748 --> 00:22:37,013
And there's a ''Your Self' storage facility...

236
00:22:37,218 --> 00:22:39,709
...right outside of downtown Baltimore, sir.

237
00:22:41,923 --> 00:22:44,153
Unit 31 was leased...

238
00:22:44,358 --> 00:22:47,623
...for 1 0 years, prepaid in full.

239
00:22:47,828 --> 00:22:49,762
The contract was in the name...

240
00:22:49,964 --> 00:22:53,730
...of a Miss Hester Mofet.

241
00:22:53,935 --> 00:22:56,563
So nobody's been in here since 1 980?

242
00:22:56,771 --> 00:22:58,568
Not to my knowledge.

243
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,906
Privacy is a great concern to my customers.

244
00:23:03,644 --> 00:23:05,737
Yes, l won't disturb anything, l promise.

245
00:23:05,947 --> 00:23:07,972
l'll be out of here before you know it.

246
00:23:08,516 --> 00:23:10,814
-May l help you? -Yes, actually.

247
00:23:11,185 --> 00:23:12,174
Here.

248
00:23:17,124 --> 00:23:20,719
-lt's stuck. -We could return tomorrow with my son.

249
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:23,019
What about him?

250
00:23:24,432 --> 00:23:29,369
l would ask my driver to help you, but he detests physical labor.

251
00:23:30,037 --> 00:23:31,095
Right.

252
00:23:31,806 --> 00:23:34,434
You stay here. l'll be back in one minute.

253
00:24:07,074 --> 00:24:09,668
lt's stuck. Will you hand me that flashlight?

254
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:26,856
lf this door should fall down...

255
00:24:27,395 --> 00:24:29,829
...or anything else...

256
00:24:30,031 --> 00:24:32,295
...this is the number for our Baltimore office.

257
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:34,460
They know that you're with me.

258
00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:38,364
-Call them if anything should happen. -Yes, Miss Starling.

259
00:27:09,656 --> 00:27:12,181
Clarice. Here, they're waiting for you.

260
00:27:12,392 --> 00:27:13,916
Watch your step.

261
00:27:15,128 --> 00:27:19,155
Hester Mofet. lt's an anagram, isn't it, doctor?

262
00:27:19,366 --> 00:27:22,358
Hester Mofet: ''The rest of me''?

263
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:26,705
''Miss The Rest Of Me,'' meaning that you rented that garage?

264
00:28:02,543 --> 00:28:03,567
Thank you.

265
00:28:04,778 --> 00:28:06,109
Your bleeding has stopped.

266
00:28:08,615 --> 00:28:09,775
How did...?

267
00:28:11,785 --> 00:28:12,809
lt's nothing.

268
00:28:13,587 --> 00:28:15,020
lt's just a scratch.

269
00:28:16,623 --> 00:28:18,887
Dr. Lecter, whose head is in that bottle?

270
00:28:19,092 --> 00:28:22,220
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?

271
00:28:22,496 --> 00:28:24,123
Do you know something about him?

272
00:28:24,364 --> 00:28:28,061
l might if l saw the case file. You could get that for me.

273
00:28:28,635 --> 00:28:31,604
Let's talk about Miss Mofet. You wanted me to find him.

274
00:28:32,739 --> 00:28:37,733
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine...

275
00:28:38,312 --> 00:28:42,874
...whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic.

276
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:47,682
l did not kill him, merely tucked him away, very much as l found him...

277
00:28:47,888 --> 00:28:50,254
...after he'd missed three appointments.

278
00:28:51,491 --> 00:28:53,550
lf you didn't kill him, who did?

279
00:28:53,961 --> 00:28:56,862
Who can say? Best thing for him, really.

280
00:28:57,064 --> 00:28:59,464
His therapy was going nowhere.

281
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:03,061
His dress, makeup....

282
00:29:03,503 --> 00:29:05,095
Raspail was a transvestite?

283
00:29:05,305 --> 00:29:09,969
ln life? Oh, no. Garden variety manic-depressive.

284
00:29:10,177 --> 00:29:12,645
Tedious, very tedious.

285
00:29:12,846 --> 00:29:15,246
l now think of him as an experiment.

286
00:29:15,482 --> 00:29:18,974
A fledgling killer's first effort at transformation.

287
00:29:19,186 --> 00:29:21,984
How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice?

288
00:29:22,356 --> 00:29:24,290
Scared at first, then...

289
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,656
...exhilarated.

290
00:29:27,294 --> 00:29:29,489
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he?

291
00:29:29,696 --> 00:29:32,426
Apparently, he likes you and you like him too.

292
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,895
l never thought about it.

293
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:38,097
Do you think Jack Crawford wants you, sexually?

294
00:29:38,305 --> 00:29:43,436
He is much older, but do you think he visualizes scenarios, exchanges?

295
00:29:43,644 --> 00:29:44,804
Fucking you?

296
00:29:47,881 --> 00:29:52,978
That doesn't interest me. lt's the sort of thing that Miggs would say.

297
00:29:55,022 --> 00:29:56,546
Not anymore.

298
00:30:04,164 --> 00:30:05,791
Thank you, Barney.

299
00:30:09,703 --> 00:30:11,694
What happened to your drawings?

300
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:17,709
Punishment, you see, for Miggs. Just like that gospel program.

301
00:30:18,045 --> 00:30:20,809
When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up.

302
00:30:21,148 --> 00:30:24,311
Dr. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.

303
00:30:25,118 --> 00:30:27,348
What did you mean by ''transformation,'' doctor?

304
00:30:36,496 --> 00:30:39,863
l've been in this room for eight years now, Clarice.

305
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,601
l know they will never ever let me out while l'm alive.

306
00:30:44,438 --> 00:30:46,565
What l want is a view.

307
00:30:46,773 --> 00:30:50,573
l want a window where l can see a tree or even water.

308
00:30:50,777 --> 00:30:54,406
l want to be in a federal institution far away from Dr. Chilton.

309
00:30:54,614 --> 00:30:56,980
What did you mean by ''fledgling killer''?

310
00:30:57,184 --> 00:30:59,015
Are you saying he's killed again?

311
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:02,516
l'm offering you a psychological profile on Buffalo Bill...

312
00:31:02,723 --> 00:31:04,816
...based on the case evidence.

313
00:31:10,197 --> 00:31:19,338
l'll help you catch him, Clarice.

314
00:31:19,338 --> 00:31:21,397
You know who he is, don't you?

315
00:31:22,274 --> 00:31:25,004
Tell me who decapitated your patient, doctor.

316
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:28,008
All good things to those who wait.

317
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,576
l've waited, Clarice. But how long can you and old Jackie-boy wait?

318
00:31:33,152 --> 00:31:38,317
Our little Billy must already be searching for that next special lady.

319
00:31:42,094 --> 00:31:45,928


320
00:32:41,487 --> 00:32:43,580
Hey, little cheeper.

321
00:32:51,997 --> 00:32:53,589
l'll be right there.

322
00:33:13,385 --> 00:33:14,215
Jeez!

323
00:33:20,325 --> 00:33:21,986
Can l help you with that?

324
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:24,095
Would you?

325
00:33:24,296 --> 00:33:25,388
Sure.

326
00:33:26,165 --> 00:33:26,995
Thank you.

327
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:29,497
That's all right. You look kind of handicapped.

328
00:33:29,702 --> 00:33:33,695
Yeah. l got it this far, l just can't get it up in the truck by myself.

329
00:33:33,906 --> 00:33:35,771
Here, grab this. Up!

330
00:33:36,108 --> 00:33:37,166
Okay.

331
00:33:37,376 --> 00:33:39,776
Just set it down. That's good.

332
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:43,778
Get in the truck. l want to push it all the way up.

333
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:46,075
l really appreciate this. Thank you.

334
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:50,653
Just go all the way back.

335
00:33:51,056 --> 00:33:52,921
Okay. ls this good?

336
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:54,956
Yeah, that's good.

337
00:33:56,395 --> 00:33:58,158
-That's great. -Okay.

338
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:01,488
Say, are you about a size 1 4?

339
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,860
Sorry?

340
00:34:22,221 --> 00:34:23,916


341
00:34:24,123 --> 00:34:25,420
Good.

342
00:34:43,575 --> 00:34:47,705
Oh, good. Good.

343
00:35:03,262 --> 00:35:04,661
Holds!

344
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:08,758
Ones!

345
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:18,536
Starling!

346
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:23,347
Outside. Let's go.

347
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:27,116
Cindy, in the ring for Starling. Let's go!

348
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:38,226
Pack your field gear.

349
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,125
-You're going with Crawford. -Where?

350
00:35:40,332 --> 00:35:41,993
Found a girl's body in West Virginia.

351
00:35:42,201 --> 00:35:44,897
Been in the water a week. Looks like Buffalo Bill.

352
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:50,208


353
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,077


354
00:35:56,982 --> 00:36:00,008
Keeps them alive for three days. We don't know why.

355
00:36:00,219 --> 00:36:03,313
No evidence of rape or physical abuse prior to death.

356
00:36:03,522 --> 00:36:06,013
All the mutilation you see there is postmortem.

357
00:36:06,758 --> 00:36:08,749
Okay, three days...

358
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:12,192
...then he shoots them, skins them and dumps them.

359
00:36:12,397 --> 00:36:14,092
Each body in a different river.

360
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:17,427
The water leaves us no trace evidence of any kind.

361
00:36:17,636 --> 00:36:20,070
That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one.

362
00:36:20,272 --> 00:36:23,139
Her body was the only one he weighted down.

363
00:36:23,342 --> 00:36:26,175
So actually, she was the third girl found.

364
00:36:26,378 --> 00:36:28,608
After her, he got lazy.

365
00:36:30,415 --> 00:36:33,179
Okay, let's see.

366
00:36:33,385 --> 00:36:37,583
Circles where the girls were abducted. Arrows where their bodies were found.

367
00:36:37,789 --> 00:36:42,852
This new one today washed up here. Elk River, West Virginia.

368
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:05,245
Look at him, Starling. Tell me what you see.

369
00:37:06,451 --> 00:37:07,918
Well, he's a white male.

370
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,089
Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic groups.

371
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:16,224
He's not a drifter. He's got his own house, not an apartment.

372
00:37:16,762 --> 00:37:20,095
-Why? -What he does with them takes privacy.

373
00:37:20,299 --> 00:37:24,736
He's in his 30s or 40s. He's got real physical strength.

374
00:37:24,937 --> 00:37:30,273
Combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise.

375
00:37:30,976 --> 00:37:33,570
And he's never impulsive. He'll never stop.

376
00:37:34,313 --> 00:37:36,946
Why not?

377
00:37:36,946 --> 00:37:40,575
He's got a real taste for it now, and he's getting better at his work.

378
00:37:42,285 --> 00:37:45,083
Not bad, Starling. Questions?

379
00:37:45,621 --> 00:37:47,088
Yes, sir.

380
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:51,056
You haven't mentioned anything about the information in my report...

381
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,659
...or Dr. Lecter's offer, sir.

382
00:37:52,862 --> 00:37:54,659
l'm considering it.

383
00:37:54,864 --> 00:37:57,799
That's why you sent me in there, isn't it?

384
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,059
To get his help on Buffalo Bill, sir?

385
00:38:03,172 --> 00:38:05,834
Well, if that was the case, then...

386
00:38:06,042 --> 00:38:08,806
...l just wish l was in on it, that's all.

387
00:38:09,011 --> 00:38:13,107
lf l'd sent you in there with a real agenda, Lecter would have known it.

388
00:38:13,316 --> 00:38:16,945
He would have toyed with you, then turned to stone.

389
00:38:31,367 --> 00:38:34,097


390
00:38:50,486 --> 00:38:52,283
Excuse me, Sheriff Perkins?

391
00:38:52,488 --> 00:38:53,750
These are the FBl people.

392
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:59,019
Sheriff Perkins, Jack Crawford, FBl. Special Agent Terry, Agent Starling.

393
00:38:59,228 --> 00:39:01,890
We appreciate being invited to your jurisdiction.

394
00:39:02,098 --> 00:39:05,329
Somebody from the state attorney's office called you.

395
00:39:05,535 --> 00:39:07,594
We'll extend you every courtesy, but right now--

396
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,065
Sheriff...

397
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:14,538
...this type of sex crime has aspects l'd just as soon discuss in private.

398
00:39:14,744 --> 00:39:16,336
Know what l mean?

399
00:41:07,223 --> 00:41:09,623
Oscar, fetch Dr. Akin from the chapel.

400
00:41:09,825 --> 00:41:10,849
We're back here.

401
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,223
Tell Lamar to come on when he's finished playing his music.

402
00:41:14,497 --> 00:41:16,897
Yeah, we'll be sending in a minute.

403
00:41:18,067 --> 00:41:20,001
lt's working.

404
00:41:20,202 --> 00:41:23,501
l need a six-way link up. Chicago, Detroit--

405
00:41:23,706 --> 00:41:25,105
What? What?

406
00:41:30,046 --> 00:41:31,741
Excuse me.

407
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:35,212
Excuse me, officers and gentlemen. Listen here, now.

408
00:41:35,418 --> 00:41:37,613
There's things we need to do for her.

409
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:41,347
Y'all brought her this far, and her folks would thank you if they could...

410
00:41:41,557 --> 00:41:44,151
...for your kindness and your sensitivity.

411
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,090
Please, go on now, and let us take care of her.

412
00:41:48,264 --> 00:41:49,356
Go on, now.

413
00:41:52,668 --> 00:41:54,636
Thank you.

414
00:41:57,773 --> 00:41:59,070
Thank you.

415
00:42:00,776 --> 00:42:02,107
Okay, good.

416
00:42:10,453 --> 00:42:15,117
Yeah, that's right. Elk River. Stand by for transmission.

417
00:42:19,261 --> 00:42:20,228
Ray.

418
00:42:32,742 --> 00:42:35,472
Doctor, Lamar. Let's take a look at her.

419
00:42:52,628 --> 00:42:53,686
Jesus....

420
00:43:01,103 --> 00:43:02,161
Okay, Starling.

421
00:43:24,827 --> 00:43:29,662
Star-shaped contact entrance wound over the sternum.

422
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,465
A muzzle stamp at the top.

423
00:43:33,669 --> 00:43:36,763
-Wrongful death. -Wrongful death.

424
00:43:37,006 --> 00:43:40,305
She'll have to go to the state pathologist's at Claxton.

425
00:43:40,509 --> 00:43:42,602
Well, l better get back to that service.

426
00:43:42,812 --> 00:43:44,143
Lamar will help you.

427
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:47,007
Lord Almighty.

428
00:43:50,886 --> 00:43:52,979
What else do you see, Starling?

429
00:43:54,156 --> 00:43:57,592
Well, she's not local.

430
00:43:57,793 --> 00:44:00,626
Her ears are pierced three times and there's...

431
00:44:02,131 --> 00:44:05,066
...glitter nail polish. lt looks like town to me.

432
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:14,304
Two of her fingernails are broken off...

433
00:44:14,509 --> 00:44:16,807
...and there's dirt or grit under them.

434
00:44:17,011 --> 00:44:20,071
lt looks like she's tried to claw her way through something.

435
00:44:20,581 --> 00:44:23,311
Ray, get pictures of her teeth. We'll fax them to Missing Persons.

436
00:44:23,518 --> 00:44:24,746
Right.

437
00:44:34,395 --> 00:44:35,726
Let's do another.

438
00:44:44,906 --> 00:44:46,498
She's got something in her throat.

439
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:49,968
When a body comes out of the water...

440
00:44:50,178 --> 00:44:52,840
...lots of times there's leaves and things in the mouth.

441
00:45:24,245 --> 00:45:25,439
What is that?

442
00:45:25,646 --> 00:45:27,238
Some kind of seedpod?

443
00:45:27,448 --> 00:45:30,315
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.

444
00:45:30,952 --> 00:45:33,512
There's no way that could get way down in there.

445
00:45:33,721 --> 00:45:36,451
Not unless somebody shoved it in there.

446
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:41,055
She'll be easier to print when we turn her.

447
00:45:41,262 --> 00:45:42,593
Lamar, give me a hand?

448
00:45:42,797 --> 00:45:44,287
Yes, sir, l will.

449
00:45:48,636 --> 00:45:52,436
Oh, Jack. What do you make of these?

450
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,803
Different configuration than the other victims. Get close-ups.

451
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:57,602
Victim's skin removed...

452
00:45:57,812 --> 00:46:00,906
...in two diamond-shaped sections above the buttocks.

453
00:46:01,115 --> 00:46:04,312
Exit wound level with the second or third thoracic vertebrae...

454
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:07,386
...approximately six inches from the right shoulder blade.

455
00:46:07,588 --> 00:46:08,987
Starling...

456
00:46:10,091 --> 00:46:13,583
...when l told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman...

457
00:46:13,795 --> 00:46:15,387
...that burned you, didn't it?

458
00:46:15,596 --> 00:46:19,054
lt was just smoke, Starling. l had to get rid of him.

459
00:46:19,267 --> 00:46:21,064
lt matters, Mr. Crawford.

460
00:46:21,269 --> 00:46:23,396
Cops look at you to see how to act.

461
00:46:23,604 --> 00:46:25,071
lt matters.

462
00:46:25,306 --> 00:46:26,603
Point taken.

463
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,810
Ligature marks found around wrists...

464
00:46:35,016 --> 00:46:36,677
...not around the ankles.

465
00:46:36,884 --> 00:46:39,717
This would indicate that the skinning was postmortem.

466
00:47:03,578 --> 00:47:04,636
Time, Pilch. My move.

467
00:47:04,846 --> 00:47:09,749
-No fair! You lured him with produce. -Tough noogies. lt's still my turn.

468
00:47:10,184 --> 00:47:12,152
Nice and slow, baby.

469
00:47:12,553 --> 00:47:15,852
lf the beetle moves one of your men, does that still count?

470
00:47:17,458 --> 00:47:19,653
Of course it counts. How do you play?

471
00:47:20,828 --> 00:47:23,456
Agent Starling?

472
00:47:23,898 --> 00:47:25,593
Where the heck did this come from?

473
00:47:25,967 --> 00:47:27,559
lt's practically mush.

474
00:47:27,768 --> 00:47:32,000
lt was found in a murder victim. The body was in the Elk River.

475
00:47:32,206 --> 00:47:33,673
lt's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?

476
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:35,206
l can't tell you any more.

477
00:47:35,409 --> 00:47:36,603
We heard it on the radio.

478
00:47:36,811 --> 00:47:40,110
You mean this is a clue from a real murder case? Cool!

479
00:47:40,314 --> 00:47:42,942
Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.

480
00:47:43,351 --> 00:47:46,081
Sphingid Ceratomia, maybe--

481
00:47:46,287 --> 00:47:48,915
Boy, he's a big sucker.

482
00:47:49,724 --> 00:47:51,021
Okay...

483
00:47:51,225 --> 00:47:53,193
...let's check morphology.

484
00:48:02,069 --> 00:48:04,765
What do you do when you're not detecting, Agent Starling?

485
00:48:06,073 --> 00:48:08,598
Try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.

486
00:48:09,143 --> 00:48:11,703
You ever go out for cheeseburgers and beer?

487
00:48:12,947 --> 00:48:14,778
The amusing house wine?

488
00:48:14,982 --> 00:48:16,813
Are you hitting on me, doctor?

489
00:48:17,652 --> 00:48:19,517
-Yes. -Gotcha!

490
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:20,584
What do you got?

491
00:48:20,788 --> 00:48:25,657
Agent Starling, meet Mr. Acherontia Styx.

492
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:26,952
Weird.

493
00:48:27,161 --> 00:48:30,358
Better known to his friends as the Death's-head moth.

494
00:48:30,564 --> 00:48:31,724
Where does it come from?

495
00:48:31,933 --> 00:48:34,868
That's what's strange. They only live in Asia.

496
00:48:35,069 --> 00:48:37,697
They're specially raised from imported eggs.

497
00:48:37,905 --> 00:48:41,272
Somebody grew this guy. Fed him honey and nightshade.

498
00:48:41,475 --> 00:48:43,272
Kept him warm.

499
00:48:44,045 --> 00:48:45,842
Somebody loved him.

500
00:49:19,947 --> 00:49:21,778
Where are you?!

501
00:49:22,883 --> 00:49:25,283
Let me out of here!

502
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:32,553
Hey!

503
00:49:33,794 --> 00:49:36,194
Please help me!

504
00:49:38,933 --> 00:49:41,060
Help me, please!

505
00:49:41,268 --> 00:49:43,793
Why won't you answer me?! Please!

506
00:49:46,774 --> 00:49:50,005
-Good morning. l'm Donna Ferucchi. -l'm Gene Cassel with sports.

507
00:49:50,211 --> 00:49:53,203
And l'm Tim Langhorn. Our top story this morning:

508
00:49:53,547 --> 00:49:57,813
Catherine Martin, the 25-year-old daughter of Senator Ruth Martin...

509
00:49:58,019 --> 00:49:59,350
...listed as a missing person...

510
00:49:59,553 --> 00:50:04,047
...is believed to have been kidnapped by the killer known as ''Buffalo Bill.''

511
00:50:04,258 --> 00:50:07,694
Memphis police say the missing girl's blouse has been identified...

512
00:50:07,895 --> 00:50:12,457
...sliced up the back, in what has become a kind of grim calling card.

513
00:50:12,666 --> 00:50:16,602
Young Catherine is the only daughter of U.S. Senator Ruth Martin...

514
00:50:16,804 --> 00:50:18,829
...the Republican senator from Tennessee.

515
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,669
And while her kidnapping is not considered politically motivated...

516
00:50:22,877 --> 00:50:25,812
...it has stirred the government to its highest levels.

517
00:50:26,013 --> 00:50:28,811
Reached for comment on the ski slopes of Vermont...

518
00:50:29,016 --> 00:50:32,577
...the president himself said to be, and l quote, ''intensely concerned.''

519
00:50:32,787 --> 00:50:37,383
Just moments ago, Senator Martin taped this dramatic personal plea:

520
00:50:37,591 --> 00:50:41,391
l'm speaking, now, to the person holding my daughter.

521
00:50:42,496 --> 00:50:45,932
Catherine is very gentle and kind.

522
00:50:46,367 --> 00:50:48,665
Talk to her and you'll see.

523
00:50:50,037 --> 00:50:53,905
You have the power. You are in charge.

524
00:50:56,544 --> 00:50:59,945
l know you can feel love and compassion.

525
00:51:01,248 --> 00:51:05,014
You have a wonderful chance to show the whole world...

526
00:51:05,219 --> 00:51:08,677
...that you can be merciful, as well as strong.

527
00:51:08,889 --> 00:51:11,653
That you're big enough to treat Catherine better...

528
00:51:11,859 --> 00:51:14,020
...than the world has treated you.

529
00:51:14,228 --> 00:51:16,196
You have that power.

530
00:51:16,196 --> 00:51:20,690
Please. My daughter is Catherine.

531
00:51:20,901 --> 00:51:22,960
Boy, that's smart.

532
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:24,637
Jesus, that's really smart.

533
00:51:24,871 --> 00:51:26,839
She keeps repeating the name.

534
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:31,602
lf he sees Catherine as a person, not an object, it's harder to tear her up.

535
00:51:31,812 --> 00:51:35,543
Please, release my little girl.

536
00:51:35,816 --> 00:51:39,377
What you're doing, Ms. Starling, is coming into my hospital...

537
00:51:39,586 --> 00:51:43,147
...and refusing to share information with me for the third time.

538
00:51:43,457 --> 00:51:47,951
Sir, l told you this is just a routine follow-up on the Raspail--

539
00:51:48,161 --> 00:51:50,254
He is my patient. l have rights.

540
00:51:50,464 --> 00:51:51,294
l understand that.

541
00:51:51,498 --> 00:51:55,992
Look, l am not just some turnkey, Miss Starling.

542
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:59,334
This is the number for the U.S. Attorney.

543
00:51:59,539 --> 00:52:03,839
Please, either discuss it with him or let me do my job, you understand?

544
00:52:09,349 --> 00:52:12,512
lf your profile helps us catch Buffalo Bill...

545
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:15,347
...in time to save Catherine Martin...

546
00:52:15,555 --> 00:52:19,047
...the senator promises you a transfer to the VA Hospital...

547
00:52:19,259 --> 00:52:22,695
...at Oneida Park, New York, with a view of the woods nearby.

548
00:52:22,896 --> 00:52:25,626
Maximum security still applies, of course.

549
00:52:26,032 --> 00:52:28,592
You'd have reasonable access to books.

550
00:52:29,469 --> 00:52:30,561
Best of all, though...

551
00:52:31,771 --> 00:52:35,798
...one week of the year, you get to leave the hospital...

552
00:52:36,009 --> 00:52:38,341
...and go here:

553
00:52:40,914 --> 00:52:42,848
Plum lsland.

554
00:52:43,783 --> 00:52:46,980
Every day of that week, you may walk on the beach.

555
00:52:47,187 --> 00:52:50,384
You may swim in the ocean for up to one hour...

556
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:53,218
...under SWAT team surveillance, of course.

557
00:52:54,394 --> 00:52:55,554
And there you have it.

558
00:52:58,331 --> 00:53:02,563
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.

559
00:53:03,537 --> 00:53:05,971
A copy of the senator's offer.

560
00:53:06,173 --> 00:53:09,438
This offer is non-negotiable and final.

561
00:53:10,143 --> 00:53:12,668
Catherine Martin dies, you get nothing.

562
00:53:23,023 --> 00:53:27,619
Plum lsland Animal Disease Research Center.

563
00:53:29,329 --> 00:53:30,853
Sounds charming.

564
00:53:31,665 --> 00:53:35,294
That's only part of the island. There's a very nice beach.

565
00:53:35,502 --> 00:53:37,732
Terns nest there. There's beautiful--

566
00:53:37,938 --> 00:53:40,065
Terns?

567
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:44,101
lf l help you, Clarice, it will be ''turns'' with us too.

568
00:53:44,311 --> 00:53:47,405
Quid pro quo. l tell you things, you tell me things.

569
00:53:47,614 --> 00:53:50,276
Not about this case, though. About yourself.

570
00:53:50,483 --> 00:53:53,452
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?

571
00:53:55,989 --> 00:53:59,481
Yes or no, Clarice? Poor little Catherine is waiting.

572
00:54:00,694 --> 00:54:02,093
Go, doctor.

573
00:54:03,296 --> 00:54:05,890
What is your worst memory of childhood?

574
00:54:07,867 --> 00:54:09,528
The death of my father.

575
00:54:10,403 --> 00:54:13,463
Tell me about it. And don't lie, or l'll know.

576
00:54:14,541 --> 00:54:16,668
He was a town marshal...

577
00:54:17,978 --> 00:54:23,245
...and one night he surprised two burglars coming out of a drugstore.

578
00:54:25,018 --> 00:54:26,451
They shot him.

579
00:54:27,087 --> 00:54:29,282
Was he killed outright?

580
00:54:29,489 --> 00:54:34,085
No, he was very strong. He lasted more than a month.

581
00:54:34,761 --> 00:54:37,229
My mother died when l was very young, so...

582
00:54:39,299 --> 00:54:42,393
...my father had become the whole world to me...

583
00:54:42,602 --> 00:54:45,969
...and when he left me, l had nothing. l was 1 0 years old.

584
00:54:46,706 --> 00:54:49,368
You're very frank, Clarice.

585
00:54:49,709 --> 00:54:54,442
l think it would be quite something to know you in private life.

586
00:54:56,383 --> 00:54:58,214
Quid pro quo, doctor.

587
00:54:59,286 --> 00:55:03,814
So tell me about Miss West Virginia. Was she a large girl?

588
00:55:06,593 --> 00:55:07,423
Yes.

589
00:55:07,627 --> 00:55:10,027
Big through the hips, roomy?

590
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:11,527
They all were.

591
00:55:12,265 --> 00:55:13,425
What else?

592
00:55:13,633 --> 00:55:17,433
She had an object deliberately inserted into her throat.

593
00:55:17,637 --> 00:55:22,165
Now, that hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what it means.

594
00:55:22,375 --> 00:55:24,002
Was it a butterfly?

595
00:55:25,412 --> 00:55:28,040
Yes. A moth.

596
00:55:28,682 --> 00:55:33,381
Just like the one we found in Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.

597
00:55:34,354 --> 00:55:36,185
Why does he place them there, doctor?

598
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:40,817
The significance of the moth is change.

599
00:55:41,027 --> 00:55:44,929
Caterpillar into chrysalis, or pupa...

600
00:55:45,131 --> 00:55:47,793
...and from thence into beauty.

601
00:55:48,001 --> 00:55:50,936
Our Billy wants to change too.

602
00:55:51,705 --> 00:55:54,833
There's no correlation between transsexualism and violence.

603
00:55:55,041 --> 00:55:57,839
-Transsexuals are very passive. -Clever girl.

604
00:55:58,511 --> 00:56:01,776
You're so close to the way you're gonna catch him. Do you realize that?

605
00:56:01,981 --> 00:56:03,949
No. Tell me why.

606
00:56:04,751 --> 00:56:08,517
After your father's murder you were orphaned. What happened next?

607
00:56:12,425 --> 00:56:16,589
l don't imagine the answer is on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.

608
00:56:16,796 --> 00:56:20,698
l went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana.

609
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,197
They had a ranch.

610
00:56:22,836 --> 00:56:24,201
Was it a cattle ranch?

611
00:56:24,604 --> 00:56:26,299
Sheep and horses.

612
00:56:26,806 --> 00:56:28,103
How long did you live there?

613
00:56:29,309 --> 00:56:30,241
Two months.

614
00:56:30,777 --> 00:56:31,869
Why so briefly?

615
00:56:32,479 --> 00:56:33,537
l ran away.

616
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:37,915
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher make you perform fellatio?

617
00:56:38,118 --> 00:56:40,086
Did he sodomize you?

618
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,315
No. He was a very decent man.

619
00:56:45,592 --> 00:56:48,254
Quid pro quo, doctor.

620
00:56:49,529 --> 00:56:51,895
Billy is not a real transsexual.

621
00:56:52,098 --> 00:56:53,998
But he thinks he is. He tries to be.

622
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,067
He's tried to be a lot of things, l expect.

623
00:56:57,270 --> 00:57:01,263
You said l was very close to the way we'd catch him. What did you mean?

624
00:57:01,474 --> 00:57:04,170
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery:

625
00:57:04,377 --> 00:57:08,473
Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical Center.

626
00:57:08,681 --> 00:57:11,980
l wouldn't be surprised if Billy applied for sex reassignment...

627
00:57:12,185 --> 00:57:15,951
...at one or all of them, and been rejected.

628
00:57:16,156 --> 00:57:17,919
On what basis would they reject him?

629
00:57:18,958 --> 00:57:23,452
Look for severe childhood disturbances associated with violence.

630
00:57:23,663 --> 00:57:26,564
Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice...

631
00:57:26,766 --> 00:57:30,759
...he was made one through years of systematic abuse.

632
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:34,406
Billy hates his own identity, you see...

633
00:57:34,607 --> 00:57:37,371
...and he thinks that makes him a transsexual...

634
00:57:37,577 --> 00:57:41,707
...but his pathology is a thousand times more savage...

635
00:57:41,915 --> 00:57:43,712
...and more terrifying.

636
00:57:46,951 --> 00:57:51,217
lt rubs the lotion on its skin. lt does this whenever it's told.

637
00:57:51,723 --> 00:57:53,486
Mister, my family will pay cash.

638
00:57:53,692 --> 00:57:56,820
Whatever ransom you're asking for, they'll pay it.

639
00:57:57,562 --> 00:58:02,499
lt rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.

640
00:58:04,102 --> 00:58:06,570
Yes, she will, Precious. She'll get the hose.

641
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:10,403
Okay, okay, okay.

642
00:58:11,443 --> 00:58:13,274
Okay, l'll do it.

643
00:58:13,478 --> 00:58:14,945
Okay.

644
00:58:16,114 --> 00:58:21,450
Mister, if you let me go, l won't press charges. l promise.

645
00:58:22,454 --> 00:58:24,945
See, my mom is a real important woman.

646
00:58:25,156 --> 00:58:27,147
l guess you already know that.

647
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:30,351
Now it places the lotion in the basket.

648
00:58:30,795 --> 00:58:31,819
Please!

649
00:58:32,731 --> 00:58:34,790
Please, l want to go home.

650
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,694
l want to go home! Please! Please let me.

651
00:58:38,903 --> 00:58:41,337
lt places the lotion in the basket.

652
00:58:42,207 --> 00:58:46,337
l want to see my mommy. Please let me.

653
00:58:47,078 --> 00:58:50,844
l want to see my mom again. l want--

654
00:58:51,049 --> 00:58:53,540
l want to see my mom.

655
00:58:54,352 --> 00:58:56,786
Put the fucking lotion in the basket!

656
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:36,649
You still think you're gonna walk on some beach and see the birdies?

657
00:59:36,861 --> 00:59:38,624
l don't think so.

658
00:59:39,697 --> 00:59:41,892
l called Senator Ruth Martin.

659
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,864
She never heard of any deal with you.

660
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:48,264
They scammed you, Hannibal.

661
00:59:49,707 --> 00:59:51,265
Stand outside.

662
00:59:52,644 --> 00:59:54,236
And shut the door.

663
00:59:54,546 --> 00:59:55,843
Barney.

664
01:00:01,953 --> 01:00:06,219
There never was a deal with Senator Martin, but there is now.

665
01:00:06,424 --> 01:00:07,652
l designed it.

666
01:00:07,859 --> 01:00:11,625
Of course, l worked in a few conditions for my own benefit as well.

667
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:14,890
ldentify Buffalo Bill by name...

668
01:00:15,099 --> 01:00:17,158
...and if the girl is found in time...

669
01:00:17,368 --> 01:00:21,634
...you'll be transferred to Brushy Mountain State Prison in Tennessee.

670
01:00:22,707 --> 01:00:24,572
Answer me, Hannibal.

671
01:00:26,544 --> 01:00:28,136
You answer me now...

672
01:00:28,346 --> 01:00:31,213
...or, by God, you'll never leave this cell.

673
01:00:33,184 --> 01:00:35,414
Who is Buffalo Bill?

674
01:00:36,287 --> 01:00:38,448
His first name is Louis.

675
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:42,451
l'll tell the rest to the Senator herself, but only in Tennessee.

676
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:45,128
And l have a few conditions of my own.

677
01:00:47,732 --> 01:00:49,825
Clean him up and get him ready to go.

678
01:00:50,869 --> 01:00:54,066
Jack, Hannibal Lecter is being transferred to Memphis.

679
01:00:54,305 --> 01:00:55,533
Transferred?

680
01:00:55,740 --> 01:01:00,234
Did you have a trainee make a phony offer to Lecter in the senator's name?

681
01:01:00,445 --> 01:01:02,276
l rolled the dice. l had to.

682
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,505
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.

683
01:01:04,716 --> 01:01:06,650
Paul Krendler's here from Justice.

684
01:01:06,851 --> 01:01:09,684
She's asking him to take over in Memphis.

685
01:01:16,227 --> 01:01:20,061


686
01:01:34,279 --> 01:01:36,144
Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter.

687
01:01:36,347 --> 01:01:38,975
l'm Lieutenant Boyle. This is Sergeant Patrick.

688
01:01:39,183 --> 01:01:41,276
We'll treat you as good as you treat us.

689
01:01:41,486 --> 01:01:44,580
You be a gentleman, you'll get three hots and a cot.

690
01:01:45,623 --> 01:01:49,491
Sir, if you sign right here, we'll have us a legal transfer.

691
01:01:54,832 --> 01:01:56,527
Here, sir, use mine.

692
01:02:43,715 --> 01:02:44,704
Senator Martin...

693
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:48,177
...Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

694
01:02:52,924 --> 01:02:54,516
Dr. Lecter...

695
01:02:54,993 --> 01:02:58,451
...l've brought an affidavit guaranteeing your new rights.

696
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:01,221
You'll want to read it before l sign.

697
01:03:04,869 --> 01:03:09,101
l won't waste your time or Catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges.

698
01:03:09,307 --> 01:03:13,209
Clarice Starling and Jack Crawford have wasted too much time already.

699
01:03:13,711 --> 01:03:16,737
l only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl.

700
01:03:17,815 --> 01:03:21,080
Let me help you now. l will trust you when it is all over.

701
01:03:21,552 --> 01:03:23,577
You have my word. Paul.

702
01:03:26,324 --> 01:03:28,792
Buffalo Bill's real name is Louis Friend.

703
01:03:30,128 --> 01:03:34,087
l met him just once. He was referred to me in April or May, 1 980...

704
01:03:34,298 --> 01:03:36,960
...by my patient Benjamin Raspail.

705
01:03:37,168 --> 01:03:39,102
They were lovers, you see.

706
01:03:39,470 --> 01:03:43,429
But Raspail had become very frightened.

707
01:03:43,641 --> 01:03:47,077
Apparently, Louis had murdered a transient...

708
01:03:47,278 --> 01:03:49,012
...and done things with the skin.

709
01:03:49,012 --> 01:03:50,843
...and done things with the skin.

710
01:03:51,748 --> 01:03:54,239
We need his address and a physical description.

711
01:03:55,551 --> 01:03:57,382
Tell me, senator.

712
01:03:57,854 --> 01:04:00,288
Did you nurse Catherine yourself?

713
01:04:00,723 --> 01:04:03,351
-What? -Did you breast-feed her?

714
01:04:03,559 --> 01:04:05,925
-Now, wait a minute! -Yes. l did.

715
01:04:06,229 --> 01:04:08,322
Toughened your nipples, didn't it?

716
01:04:08,531 --> 01:04:09,520
You son of a bitch!

717
01:04:10,033 --> 01:04:13,833
Amputate a man's leg, and he can still feel it tickling.

718
01:04:14,011 --> 01:04:17,310
Tell me, Mom, when your little girl is on the slab...

719
01:04:17,514 --> 01:04:18,981
...where will it tickle you?

720
01:04:19,917 --> 01:04:23,250
Take this thing back to Baltimore.

721
01:04:24,254 --> 01:04:27,223
Five-foot-ten, strongly built, about 1 80 pounds.

722
01:04:27,424 --> 01:04:29,984
Hair, blond. Eyes, pale blue.

723
01:04:30,194 --> 01:04:31,422
He'd be about 35 now.

724
01:04:31,628 --> 01:04:34,529
He said he lived in Philadelphia but may have lied.

725
01:04:34,732 --> 01:04:36,461
That's all l can remember, Mom.

726
01:04:36,667 --> 01:04:39,329
But if l think of any more, l will let you know.

727
01:04:41,805 --> 01:04:44,239
Oh, and senator, just one more thing:

728
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:48,407
Love your suit.

729
01:04:50,547 --> 01:04:53,516
ln a meeting earlier today with Senator Ruth Martin...

730
01:04:53,717 --> 01:04:57,949
...Dr. Lecter agreed to help in the investigation to find Buffalo Bill.

731
01:04:58,155 --> 01:04:59,554


732
01:05:00,357 --> 01:05:02,325
-How do you fit in? -My unique insight...

733
01:05:02,526 --> 01:05:04,460
...into Lecter made the breakthrough.

734
01:05:04,661 --> 01:05:05,719
Buffalo Bill's name?

735
01:05:05,929 --> 01:05:09,695
His name is now a matter of record with the proper authorities.

736
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:12,368
-Can you give us--? -l'm Dr. Frederick Chilton.

737
01:05:12,569 --> 01:05:14,127
-Spell it? -That's C-H--

738
01:05:15,806 --> 01:05:17,797
Are you with Dr. Chilton's group?

739
01:05:18,008 --> 01:05:20,499
Well, l just saw him outside, sir.

740
01:05:20,711 --> 01:05:23,976
Access to Lecter is limited. We've received death threats.

741
01:05:24,181 --> 01:05:25,773
l understand, sir.

742
01:05:31,889 --> 01:05:33,516
Log in and check your weapon.

743
01:05:34,958 --> 01:05:37,188
l can't take all the credit myself.

744
01:05:37,394 --> 01:05:39,692
Senator Martin, Justice Department, FBl...

745
01:05:39,897 --> 01:05:43,333
...folks at the Baltimore State Hospital. Now for the hard part:

746
01:05:43,534 --> 01:05:45,331
Apprehending the suspect.

747
01:05:45,836 --> 01:05:47,895
Excuse me, l have to catch a flight.

748
01:05:52,142 --> 01:05:54,337
Command desk, Officer Jacobs.

749
01:06:00,217 --> 01:06:01,707


750
01:06:01,919 --> 01:06:03,079


751
01:06:03,287 --> 01:06:06,347
-ls it true what they're saying? -Huh?

752
01:06:07,357 --> 01:06:09,382
He's some kind of vampire?

753
01:06:11,662 --> 01:06:13,857
They don't have a name for what he is.

754
01:06:14,965 --> 01:06:16,660
You do know the rules, ma'am?

755
01:06:17,367 --> 01:06:19,699
Yes, l've questioned him before.

756
01:06:23,207 --> 01:06:24,196
Go ahead.

757
01:07:01,712 --> 01:07:03,680
Good evening, Clarice.

758
01:07:05,249 --> 01:07:07,945
l thought you might like your drawings back.

759
01:07:10,621 --> 01:07:12,612
Just until you get your view.

760
01:07:13,357 --> 01:07:15,587
How very thoughtful.

761
01:07:16,527 --> 01:07:19,325
Or did Jack Crawford send you for one last wheedle...

762
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:21,760
...before you're both booted off the case?

763
01:07:22,266 --> 01:07:24,461
No. l came because l wanted to.

764
01:07:29,139 --> 01:07:31,573
People will say we're in love.

765
01:07:35,712 --> 01:07:38,203
Anthrax lsland.

766
01:07:38,415 --> 01:07:41,384
That was an especially nice touch, Clarice.

767
01:07:41,585 --> 01:07:42,574
Yours?

768
01:07:43,287 --> 01:07:44,311
Yes.

769
01:07:44,521 --> 01:07:46,079
Yeah.

770
01:07:46,723 --> 01:07:48,520
That was good.

771
01:07:48,725 --> 01:07:50,659
Pity about poor Catherine, though.

772
01:07:50,861 --> 01:07:52,886
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

773
01:07:53,096 --> 01:07:55,894
Your anagrams are showing, doctor.

774
01:07:56,733 --> 01:07:58,257
Louis Friend?

775
01:07:58,969 --> 01:08:02,166
lron sulfide, also known as fool's gold.

776
01:08:02,606 --> 01:08:06,508
Oh, Clarice, your problem is, you need to get more fun out of life.

777
01:08:06,977 --> 01:08:09,946
You were telling me the truth back in Baltimore, sir.

778
01:08:10,147 --> 01:08:11,614
Please continue now.

779
01:08:12,216 --> 01:08:14,707
Well, l've read the case files. Have you?

780
01:08:15,085 --> 01:08:18,145
Everything you need to find him is there in those pages.

781
01:08:18,355 --> 01:08:21,256
-Then tell me how. -First principles, Clarice.

782
01:08:21,458 --> 01:08:24,552
Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius.

783
01:08:24,761 --> 01:08:28,219
Of each particular thing, ask: What is it in itself?

784
01:08:28,432 --> 01:08:30,229
What is its nature?

785
01:08:30,667 --> 01:08:34,569
What does he do, this man you seek?

786
01:08:36,073 --> 01:08:37,301
He kills women.

787
01:08:37,507 --> 01:08:40,476
No. That is incidental.

788
01:08:41,478 --> 01:08:46,575
What is the principle thing he does? What needs does he serve by killing?

789
01:08:47,117 --> 01:08:48,345
Anger...

790
01:08:49,987 --> 01:08:54,014
...social acceptance and sexual frustration--

791
01:08:54,224 --> 01:08:55,213
No!

792
01:08:55,792 --> 01:08:57,817
He covets.

793
01:08:58,695 --> 01:09:00,253
That is his nature.

794
01:09:00,764 --> 01:09:03,096
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?

795
01:09:03,867 --> 01:09:06,495
Do we seek out things to covet?

796
01:09:07,104 --> 01:09:09,004
Make an effort to answer now.

797
01:09:09,206 --> 01:09:11,674
No, we just--

798
01:09:11,875 --> 01:09:15,208
No, we begin by coveting what we see every day.

799
01:09:15,412 --> 01:09:18,711
Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice?

800
01:09:19,449 --> 01:09:22,850
And don't your eyes seek out the things you want?

801
01:09:23,553 --> 01:09:25,885
All right, yes. Now, please tell me how.

802
01:09:26,089 --> 01:09:27,556
No.

803
01:09:28,292 --> 01:09:30,260
lt is your turn to tell me, Clarice.

804
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:32,928
You don't have any more vacations to sell.

805
01:09:33,597 --> 01:09:36,088
Why did you leave that ranch?

806
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:40,427
Doctor, we don't have any more time for any of this now.

807
01:09:40,637 --> 01:09:43,162
But we don't reckon time the same way, do we?

808
01:09:43,373 --> 01:09:45,238
This is all the time you'll have.

809
01:09:45,442 --> 01:09:47,740
Later. Please listen. We've only got five--

810
01:09:47,944 --> 01:09:53,417
No! l will listen now.

811
01:09:53,417 --> 01:09:56,386
Your father's murder orphaned you when you were 1 0.

812
01:09:56,586 --> 01:10:01,421
You went to live with cousins on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And?

813
01:10:03,694 --> 01:10:05,889
And one morning l just ran away.

814
01:10:06,663 --> 01:10:10,155
Not ''just,'' Clarice. What set you off?

815
01:10:10,367 --> 01:10:11,959
You started at what time?

816
01:10:12,703 --> 01:10:14,000
Early, still dark.

817
01:10:14,204 --> 01:10:16,798
Then something woke you. Was it a dream?

818
01:10:17,007 --> 01:10:18,099
What was it?

819
01:10:19,643 --> 01:10:21,406
l heard a strange noise.

820
01:10:22,646 --> 01:10:24,011
What was it?

821
01:10:24,581 --> 01:10:25,843
lt was...

822
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:28,540
...screaming.

823
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,816
Some kind of screaming, like a child's voice.

824
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:34,857
What did you do?

825
01:10:35,392 --> 01:10:36,723
l went...

826
01:10:36,927 --> 01:10:39,623
...downstairs. Outside.

827
01:10:41,765 --> 01:10:44,359
l crept up into the barn.

828
01:10:44,568 --> 01:10:47,765
l was so scared to look inside, but l had to.

829
01:10:48,905 --> 01:10:52,204
And what did you see, Clarice? What did you see?

830
01:10:53,643 --> 01:10:54,940
Lambs.

831
01:10:56,146 --> 01:10:57,807
They were screaming.

832
01:10:58,382 --> 01:11:01,146
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?

833
01:11:01,685 --> 01:11:03,414
And they were screaming.

834
01:11:04,755 --> 01:11:06,450
And you ran away?

835
01:11:06,656 --> 01:11:10,490
No. First l tried to free them.

836
01:11:11,161 --> 01:11:13,595
l opened the gate to their pen.

837
01:11:13,797 --> 01:11:17,233
They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run.

838
01:11:17,434 --> 01:11:19,925
But you could and you did, didn't you?

839
01:11:20,737 --> 01:11:24,138
Yes. l took one lamb and l ran away as fast as l could.

840
01:11:24,341 --> 01:11:26,138
Where were you going, Clarice?

841
01:11:26,343 --> 01:11:29,335
l don't know. l didn't have any food, any water...

842
01:11:29,546 --> 01:11:32,174
...and it was very cold. lt was very cold.

843
01:11:34,384 --> 01:11:35,510
l thought....

844
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:38,980
l thought if l could save just one...

845
01:11:40,991 --> 01:11:42,583
...but he was so heavy.

846
01:11:43,693 --> 01:11:45,183
He was so heavy.

847
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:54,436
l didn't get more than a few miles when the sheriffs car picked me up.

848
01:11:57,607 --> 01:12:01,805
The rancher was so angry he sent me to a Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman.

849
01:12:02,646 --> 01:12:04,637
l never saw the ranch again.

850
01:12:05,348 --> 01:12:08,078
What became of your lamb, Clarice?

851
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:11,317
They killed him.

852
01:12:11,688 --> 01:12:13,883
You still wake up sometimes, don't you?

853
01:12:14,191 --> 01:12:15,886
Wake up in the dark...

854
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:19,393
...and hear the screaming of the lambs?

855
01:12:19,996 --> 01:12:21,088
Yes.

856
01:12:22,599 --> 01:12:25,397
And you think if you save poor Catherine...

857
01:12:25,602 --> 01:12:29,163
...you can make them stop, don't you? You think if Catherine lives...

858
01:12:29,372 --> 01:12:32,569
...you won't wake up in the dark ever again...

859
01:12:32,776 --> 01:12:35,643
...to that awful screaming of the lambs.

860
01:12:36,813 --> 01:12:38,178
l don't know.

861
01:12:38,915 --> 01:12:40,246
l don't know.

862
01:12:41,952 --> 01:12:44,352
Thank you, Clarice.

863
01:12:44,554 --> 01:12:46,112
Thank you.

864
01:12:46,423 --> 01:12:48,414
Tell me his name, doctor.

865
01:12:55,365 --> 01:12:57,629
Dr. Chilton, l presume.

866
01:12:58,235 --> 01:12:59,793
l think you know each other.

867
01:13:02,038 --> 01:13:03,562
Okay.

868
01:13:04,207 --> 01:13:06,334
-We found her. -Let's go.

869
01:13:06,543 --> 01:13:08,306
lt's your turn, doctor.

870
01:13:08,712 --> 01:13:10,373
-Out! -Tell me his name.

871
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:13,413
Sorry, ma'am, l've got orders to put you on a plane.

872
01:13:13,617 --> 01:13:14,777
Come on, now.

873
01:13:15,051 --> 01:13:17,019
Brave Clarice.

874
01:13:17,354 --> 01:13:20,915
You will let me know when those lambs stop screaming, won't you?

875
01:13:21,124 --> 01:13:22,955
Tell me his name, doctor!

876
01:13:23,159 --> 01:13:24,456
Clarice!

877
01:13:25,829 --> 01:13:27,592
Your case file.

878
01:13:29,266 --> 01:13:30,358
Hey!

879
01:13:32,536 --> 01:13:34,026
Goodbye, Clarice.

880
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:41,933
Ready when you are, doc.

881
01:14:42,339 --> 01:14:44,432
Just another minute, please.

882
01:14:53,283 --> 01:14:55,717
Son of a bitch demanded a second dinner.

883
01:14:55,919 --> 01:14:57,750
Lamb chops, extra rare.

884
01:14:57,954 --> 01:15:02,550
Wonder what he wants for breakfast? Some damn thing from the zoo?

885
01:15:12,802 --> 01:15:13,791


886
01:15:24,114 --> 01:15:25,581
Good evening, gentlemen.

887
01:15:26,049 --> 01:15:27,744
Okay, doc. Grab some floor.

888
01:15:27,951 --> 01:15:30,010
Same drill as before, please.

889
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:39,158
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

890
01:15:55,745 --> 01:15:56,871
Okay.

891
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:05,186
Hand me that, would you?

892
01:16:10,926 --> 01:16:12,086
Thanks.

893
01:16:15,997 --> 01:16:17,988
Mind the drawings, please.

894
01:16:21,236 --> 01:16:22,260
Thank you.

895
01:16:46,828 --> 01:16:49,422
Pembry, watch it, he's cuffed me!

896
01:16:56,071 --> 01:16:57,504
Jesus Christ!

897
01:18:16,284 --> 01:18:18,718
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

898
01:18:28,163 --> 01:18:30,097
What is this shit?

899
01:18:32,567 --> 01:18:34,262
Did somebody go up on five?

900
01:18:34,469 --> 01:18:38,269
-No, nobody went up. -Call Pembry. Ask him to tell--

901
01:18:41,176 --> 01:18:45,237
CP, shots fired on five. Repeat, shots fired on five.

902
01:18:45,447 --> 01:18:46,778
Sergeant Tate!

903
01:18:47,382 --> 01:18:49,009
Proceed. Shots fired on five.

904
01:18:49,584 --> 01:18:51,245
Holy shit!

905
01:18:51,453 --> 01:18:53,250
-What the hell? -Bitch!

906
01:18:53,622 --> 01:18:54,611
Shut up!

907
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:56,050
Bobby, get the vest.

908
01:18:56,258 --> 01:18:57,725
Right, sarge.

909
01:18:58,059 --> 01:19:00,220
-Brady, Howard, cover-- -Look!

910
01:19:03,064 --> 01:19:04,588
lt stopped.

911
01:19:05,867 --> 01:19:07,528
Seal off a 1 0-block radius.

912
01:19:07,736 --> 01:19:10,705
Get me the SWAT team and an ambulance, double quick.

913
01:19:10,906 --> 01:19:12,066
We're going up.

914
01:19:41,069 --> 01:19:42,593
Pembry?!

915
01:19:44,039 --> 01:19:45,529
Boyle?!

916
01:19:58,520 --> 01:19:59,885
Oh, God!

917
01:20:07,028 --> 01:20:08,086
Go.

918
01:20:15,904 --> 01:20:17,303
-Clear. -Clear.

919
01:20:17,505 --> 01:20:18,904
Command post.

920
01:20:19,341 --> 01:20:20,865
Two officers down.

921
01:20:21,076 --> 01:20:22,566
-Clear! -Clear!

922
01:20:23,011 --> 01:20:24,205
Lecter's gone, sarge.

923
01:20:24,412 --> 01:20:26,209
Prisoner is missing.

924
01:20:26,414 --> 01:20:27,881
Boyle's gun is gone.

925
01:20:28,216 --> 01:20:30,684
Repeat. Lecter is missing and armed.

926
01:20:30,885 --> 01:20:32,682
He stripped the bed.

927
01:20:33,121 --> 01:20:35,885
Might be making a rope. Check all the windows.

928
01:20:36,091 --> 01:20:38,389
Where the fuck is my ambulance?

929
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:40,350
He's alive.

930
01:20:40,962 --> 01:20:43,226
Sergeant Tate! He's alive!

931
01:20:43,598 --> 01:20:46,795
Get ahold of him and feel his hands. Talk to him!

932
01:20:47,302 --> 01:20:48,326
What do l say?

933
01:20:48,536 --> 01:20:51,471
lt's Jim Pembry. Now talk to him, damn it!

934
01:20:52,374 --> 01:20:54,638
Lecter is missing and armed.

935
01:20:54,843 --> 01:20:58,677
-Pembry. Pembry, can you hear me? -He took Boyle's gun.

936
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,906
Pembry got off one round. There's a chance Lecter's hit.

937
01:21:02,117 --> 01:21:04,051
Keep breathing in and out.

938
01:21:04,252 --> 01:21:07,813
You're doing a good job. You look real good there.

939
01:21:08,456 --> 01:21:11,357
Yeah, you look-- Look real good.

940
01:21:28,343 --> 01:21:29,503
-You ready? -Let's go!

941
01:21:29,711 --> 01:21:31,702
-Let's do it. -Okay, let's go!

942
01:21:42,624 --> 01:21:44,751
Looking good. You're gonna make it.

943
01:21:44,959 --> 01:21:46,950
Everything's just fine.

944
01:21:47,162 --> 01:21:49,392
-l need that lV now! -Lactated Ringer's.

945
01:21:49,597 --> 01:21:51,963
Can we get the strap? Where's the oxygen?

946
01:21:52,167 --> 01:21:55,898
Doing good, buddy. That's right. Stay with me here.

947
01:21:57,238 --> 01:22:00,002
We're losing him! Downstairs, quickly!

948
01:22:00,341 --> 01:22:01,808
And up!

949
01:22:03,044 --> 01:22:04,102
-Elevator! -This way!

950
01:22:04,312 --> 01:22:06,974
-Out of the way! -Get out of the way!

951
01:22:10,752 --> 01:22:12,310
CP to Tate.

952
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:15,387
Roger, lieutenant. Tate here.

953
01:22:15,590 --> 01:22:18,218
l'm on the elevator bringing Pembry down.

954
01:22:18,693 --> 01:22:20,661
He seems to be hanging on.

955
01:22:21,362 --> 01:22:23,455
Top three floors secured.

956
01:22:23,998 --> 01:22:26,057
Main stairwell secured.

957
01:22:27,035 --> 01:22:28,935
We think he's on two.

958
01:22:42,183 --> 01:22:44,378
Tate, you still with me?

959
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:48,454
We're pretty sure he's somewhere on two, sir.

960
01:22:48,656 --> 01:23:10,077
That's all for now. Over.

961
01:23:10,077 --> 01:23:12,637
He's on the roof of the elevator.

962
01:23:15,349 --> 01:23:16,680
Okay, guys.

963
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:34,289
l see him.

964
01:23:34,768 --> 01:23:37,134
There's a gun by his hand. He's not moving.

965
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:40,769
-One warning. We need him alive. -Got it.

966
01:23:41,875 --> 01:23:43,103
Lecter?

967
01:23:43,410 --> 01:23:45,344
Put your hands on your head.

968
01:23:47,714 --> 01:23:49,181
One in the leg.

969
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:01,784
No movement.

970
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:05,692
Johnny, hold your fire. We're coming into the car.

971
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:07,793
We're opening the hatch.

972
01:24:08,635 --> 01:24:09,624
Watch his hands.

973
01:24:09,836 --> 01:24:12,771
lf there's any fire, it'll come from us. Affirm.

974
01:24:12,973 --> 01:24:14,031
Got it.

975
01:24:40,167 --> 01:24:42,101
Memphis General, this is Unit 26.

976
01:24:42,302 --> 01:24:44,862
We're inbound with a 50-year-old male officer...

977
01:24:45,072 --> 01:24:47,199
...with severe facial lacerations.

978
01:24:47,407 --> 01:24:50,535
He had grand mal seizure activity. He's postdictal now.

979
01:24:50,744 --> 01:24:52,905
-l copy. -Vital signs are good.

980
01:24:53,113 --> 01:24:54,774
-90 -Pressure is 1 30/90. -Ninety?

981
01:24:54,981 --> 01:24:57,142
Yeah, that's right, 90. Pulse, 84.

982
01:24:57,417 --> 01:24:59,715
We got him on lactated Ringer's running...

983
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,218
...and the patient is on 1 0 liters of oxygen.

984
01:25:03,356 --> 01:25:04,516
Watch it!

985
01:25:08,862 --> 01:25:12,263
The ambulance was found in a parking garage at Memphis Airport.

986
01:25:12,466 --> 01:25:13,933
The crew was dead.

987
01:25:15,001 --> 01:25:16,628
He killed a tourist too.

988
01:25:16,837 --> 01:25:18,702
Got his clothes, cash.

989
01:25:19,106 --> 01:25:20,903
By now he could be anywhere.

990
01:25:21,108 --> 01:25:23,099
-He won't come after me. -Oh, really?

991
01:25:23,310 --> 01:25:24,436
He won't.

992
01:25:24,911 --> 01:25:26,674
l can't explain it.

993
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:29,110
He would consider that rude.

994
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:31,414
lt's over. She's dead.

995
01:25:31,618 --> 01:25:33,245
lt's not your fault.

996
01:25:33,453 --> 01:25:38,083
Lecter said everything we need to catch him with is here, only l can't--

997
01:25:38,291 --> 01:25:40,088
Dr. Lecter said a lot of things.

998
01:25:40,827 --> 01:25:42,055
He's here, Ardelia.

999
01:26:11,691 --> 01:26:13,659
ls this Lecter's handwriting?

1000
01:26:15,695 --> 01:26:20,064
''Doesn't this random scattering of sites seem desperately random?

1001
01:26:20,267 --> 01:26:24,067
Like the elaboration of a bad liar? Ta. Hannibal Lecter.''

1002
01:26:24,271 --> 01:26:27,263
''Desperately random.'' What does he mean?

1003
01:26:27,474 --> 01:26:30,375
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's a pattern here.

1004
01:26:31,478 --> 01:26:34,709
But there's no pattern or the computers would've nailed it.

1005
01:26:34,915 --> 01:26:37,349
They're even found in random order.

1006
01:26:37,551 --> 01:26:41,385
Random because of the one girl. The one he weighted down.

1007
01:26:41,822 --> 01:26:43,722
-Fredrica Bimmel. -Right.

1008
01:26:43,924 --> 01:26:47,257
From Belvedere, Ohio.

1009
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:51,021
The first girl taken, third body found. Why?

1010
01:26:51,231 --> 01:26:53,358
She didn't drift. He weighted her down.

1011
01:26:53,567 --> 01:26:56,900
What did Lecter say about the ''first principles''?

1012
01:26:57,103 --> 01:26:58,661
Simplicity.

1013
01:26:58,872 --> 01:27:02,137
What does this guy do? He covets.

1014
01:27:02,342 --> 01:27:04,833
How do we first start to covet?

1015
01:27:05,045 --> 01:27:06,740
We covet what we see.

1016
01:27:06,947 --> 01:27:08,574
Every day.

1017
01:27:10,584 --> 01:27:11,812
Hot damn, Clarice.

1018
01:27:12,285 --> 01:27:13,547
He knew her.

1019
01:27:18,558 --> 01:27:22,392


1020
01:28:28,929 --> 01:28:30,328
Mr. Bimmel?

1021
01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:31,758
That's me.

1022
01:28:32,098 --> 01:28:34,760
Hello, l'm Clarice Starling. l'm with the FBl.

1023
01:28:38,672 --> 01:28:41,937
l appreciate you letting me take a look around, Mr. Bimmel.

1024
01:28:42,409 --> 01:28:44,536
l don't know nothing new to tell you.

1025
01:28:44,744 --> 01:28:47,679
Police been back here so many times already.

1026
01:28:48,348 --> 01:28:50,714
Fredrica went into Chicago on the bus to see about a job.

1027
01:28:52,984 --> 01:28:54,542
She left the interview okay.

1028
01:28:54,585 --> 01:28:56,177
She never come home.

1029
01:28:59,023 --> 01:29:01,184
Her bedroom's how she left it.

1030
01:29:01,626 --> 01:29:02,615
Upstairs.

1031
01:29:03,294 --> 01:29:04,784
Door to the left.

1032
01:31:49,794 --> 01:31:53,423
He's making himself a woman suit. Out of real women!

1033
01:31:53,631 --> 01:31:54,689
And he can sew!

1034
01:31:54,899 --> 01:31:57,891
He's very skilled. He's a tailor or a dressmaker or--

1035
01:31:58,102 --> 01:31:59,865
-Starling! -That's why they're big.

1036
01:32:00,071 --> 01:32:02,301
He keeps them alive so he can starve them...

1037
01:32:02,506 --> 01:32:03,939
...loosen their skin and--

1038
01:32:04,141 --> 01:32:06,666
Starling! We know who and where he is!

1039
01:32:06,877 --> 01:32:08,367
We're on our way right now.

1040
01:32:08,579 --> 01:32:11,480
-Where? -Calumet City, edge of Chicago.

1041
01:32:11,682 --> 01:32:14,242
Be on the ground in 45 minutes with HRT.

1042
01:32:14,452 --> 01:32:16,647
That's great news, sir. But how--?

1043
01:32:16,854 --> 01:32:20,415
We fed the names Johns Hopkins came up with into Known Offenders.

1044
01:32:20,624 --> 01:32:24,560
Subject's name is Jamie Gumb, a.k.a. John Grant.

1045
01:32:24,762 --> 01:32:28,459
Lecter's description was accurate. He just lied about the name.

1046
01:32:28,666 --> 01:32:30,759
Customs had some paper on him.

1047
01:32:30,968 --> 01:32:34,028
They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX.

1048
01:32:34,238 --> 01:32:36,297
Live caterpillars from Suriname.

1049
01:32:36,507 --> 01:32:39,499
The addressee was a Jame Gumb.

1050
01:32:40,077 --> 01:32:42,978
Chicago is only 400 miles from here. l'll be there in--

1051
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:44,875
No, there's not enough time.

1052
01:32:45,082 --> 01:32:47,277
We want him for murder, not kidnapping.

1053
01:32:47,485 --> 01:32:49,749
Link him to Bimmel before he's indicted.

1054
01:32:49,954 --> 01:32:53,981
-See what you can find in Belvedere. -Yes, sir. You bet. l'll do my best.

1055
01:32:54,191 --> 01:32:55,522
Starling.

1056
01:32:55,926 --> 01:32:59,521
We wouldn't have found him without you. Nobody will forget that.

1057
01:33:00,197 --> 01:33:01,789
Least of all me.

1058
01:33:02,867 --> 01:33:04,027
Thank you, sir.

1059
01:33:04,235 --> 01:33:06,567
Thank you very much, Mr. Crawford.

1060
01:33:07,838 --> 01:33:09,271
Mr. Crawford?

1061
01:33:21,786 --> 01:33:24,084
Thanks for the scraps, asshole.

1062
01:33:24,388 --> 01:33:26,322
l got a better idea.

1063
01:33:47,678 --> 01:33:50,306
Okay, Precious. Time for a little treat.

1064
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:04,750
Precious!

1065
01:34:07,097 --> 01:34:08,860
Come on, girl!

1066
01:34:09,867 --> 01:34:12,392
Come on, Precious. Come on, Precious.

1067
01:34:21,645 --> 01:34:23,374
Come on, Precious.

1068
01:34:23,581 --> 01:34:26,448
l got a yummy, yummy snack for you.

1069
01:34:26,650 --> 01:34:27,912
Come and get it!

1070
01:34:34,925 --> 01:34:36,358
Precious!

1071
01:34:37,161 --> 01:34:39,891
Are you up there, you little shit?

1072
01:34:40,431 --> 01:34:49,738
Come and get it, pretty girl.

1073
01:34:49,738 --> 01:34:51,103
Precious!

1074
01:34:51,307 --> 01:34:53,468
Please come. Come on.

1075
01:35:01,283 --> 01:35:03,251
Come on, Precious.

1076
01:35:15,130 --> 01:35:16,620
Would you fuck me?

1077
01:35:17,066 --> 01:35:20,035
Come on. Take that bone. Come on.

1078
01:35:20,736 --> 01:35:23,500
Come on. Come on! Come on!

1079
01:35:23,972 --> 01:35:25,166
l'd fuck me.

1080
01:35:25,974 --> 01:35:26,963
Come on.

1081
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:35,876
l'd fuck me hard. l'd fuck me so hard.

1082
01:35:40,055 --> 01:35:41,317
No!

1083
01:36:27,269 --> 01:36:31,797


1084
01:36:41,049 --> 01:36:42,107


1085
01:36:42,317 --> 01:36:46,219
ls that a good job, FBl agent? You get to travel around and stuff?

1086
01:36:46,422 --> 01:36:48,583
l mean, better places than this?

1087
01:36:50,392 --> 01:36:51,950
Sometimes you do.

1088
01:36:52,828 --> 01:36:57,162
Freddie was so happy for me when l got this job at the bank.

1089
01:36:57,366 --> 01:37:01,302
Toaster giveaways and Barry Manilow on the speakers all day.

1090
01:37:01,503 --> 01:37:04,063
She thought it was such hot shit.

1091
01:37:04,473 --> 01:37:06,771
What did she know? Big dummy.

1092
01:37:06,975 --> 01:37:11,139
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb?

1093
01:37:11,346 --> 01:37:13,007
Or a Jame Gumb?

1094
01:37:13,782 --> 01:37:16,046
-How about John Grant? -No.

1095
01:37:16,251 --> 01:37:18,583
Would she have had a friend you didn't know?

1096
01:37:18,787 --> 01:37:21,347
No way. lf she had a guy, l'd have known.

1097
01:37:21,557 --> 01:37:23,115
Sewing was her life.

1098
01:37:23,859 --> 01:37:25,417
Did you ever work together?

1099
01:37:25,627 --> 01:37:30,360
Me and Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman.

1100
01:37:30,899 --> 01:37:34,460
Can l get Mrs. Lippman's address? l need to talk to her.

1101
01:37:35,037 --> 01:37:38,803


1102
01:38:02,564 --> 01:38:04,327
So powerful.

1103
01:38:04,533 --> 01:38:06,160
So beautiful.

1104
01:38:11,273 --> 01:38:12,706
Precious?

1105
01:38:18,514 --> 01:38:19,503
Precious?

1106
01:38:19,715 --> 01:38:21,740
Down here, you sack of shit!

1107
01:38:30,425 --> 01:38:31,949
-Put her in that bucket. -No!

1108
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:35,027
You get me a telephone and lower it down here, now!

1109
01:38:38,166 --> 01:38:42,125
Oh, poodlie-poo. Precious? Darling, are you all right?

1110
01:38:42,337 --> 01:38:45,329
She's in a lot of pain, mister. She needs a vet.

1111
01:38:49,678 --> 01:38:52,306
She broke her leg on the way down. She's licking--

1112
01:38:52,514 --> 01:38:54,505
Hey! Don't you hurt my dog!

1113
01:38:54,716 --> 01:38:56,616
Don't you make me hurt your dog!

1114
01:38:56,818 --> 01:38:58,979
You don't know what pain is!

1115
01:39:04,393 --> 01:39:07,988
Get me that telephone or l'll kill him!

1116
01:39:12,534 --> 01:39:16,766
-Oh, fuck! -You better get me that telephone!

1117
01:39:16,972 --> 01:39:19,065
l'm gonna do it, mister!!

1118
01:39:19,274 --> 01:39:23,335
l'm gonna snap her neck off, l swear to God!

1119
01:39:23,812 --> 01:39:25,803
All right, mister. l'm doing it!

1120
01:39:49,371 --> 01:39:51,601
Okay, l'm coming.

1121
01:39:53,008 --> 01:39:54,373
We're going in.

1122
01:39:59,247 --> 01:40:01,442
Good afternoon. Sorry to bother you.

1123
01:40:01,650 --> 01:40:03,948
l'm looking for Mrs. Lippman's family.

1124
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:06,713
FBl! Everybody down!

1125
01:40:07,689 --> 01:40:09,623
Lippmans don't live here anymore.

1126
01:40:09,825 --> 01:40:12,293
Excuse me, sir. l need to speak with you.

1127
01:40:13,495 --> 01:40:15,258
-Clear! -Clear!

1128
01:40:16,064 --> 01:40:18,089
What's the problem, officer?

1129
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:21,030
l'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel.

1130
01:40:24,373 --> 01:40:28,640
There's no one here, Jack.

1131
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:30,108
Clarice.

1132
01:40:30,108 --> 01:40:31,200
Your name is...?

1133
01:40:31,409 --> 01:40:32,535
Oh, Jack Gordon.

1134
01:40:32,744 --> 01:40:34,609
Mr. Gordon. Good.

1135
01:40:34,813 --> 01:40:38,044
Fredrica worked for Mrs. Lippman. Did you know her?

1136
01:40:39,017 --> 01:40:40,678
No, uh-uh.

1137
01:40:41,252 --> 01:40:42,719
Oh, wait.

1138
01:40:43,021 --> 01:40:45,216
Was she a great big fat person?

1139
01:40:46,124 --> 01:40:47,751
Yes, she was a big girl, sir.

1140
01:40:47,959 --> 01:40:49,449
Yeah, l may have--

1141
01:40:49,661 --> 01:40:52,152
No, l read about her in the newspaper.

1142
01:40:53,999 --> 01:40:56,365
Mrs. Lippman had a son. Maybe he could help.

1143
01:40:56,568 --> 01:40:58,297
l got his card in here.

1144
01:40:58,503 --> 01:40:59,731
You want to come in?

1145
01:40:59,938 --> 01:41:01,030
-May l? -Yeah, sure.

1146
01:41:01,239 --> 01:41:02,399
Thank you.

1147
01:41:21,259 --> 01:41:23,318
Are you close to catching somebody?

1148
01:41:25,096 --> 01:41:26,085
Yes.

1149
01:41:26,297 --> 01:41:27,491
We may be.

1150
01:41:29,334 --> 01:41:30,528
Did you...

1151
01:41:31,469 --> 01:41:35,064
...take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died, is that right?

1152
01:41:36,374 --> 01:41:40,708
Yeah, l bought this house two years ago.

1153
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:45,313
Did she leave any records, any business records...

1154
01:41:45,517 --> 01:41:49,351
...tax forms, lists of employees?

1155
01:41:49,988 --> 01:41:51,922
No, nothing like that at all.

1156
01:41:54,292 --> 01:41:57,022
Say, has the FBl learned something?

1157
01:41:57,228 --> 01:42:00,629
The police around here don't seem to have the first clue.

1158
01:42:10,208 --> 01:42:14,907
Have you got, like, a description, fingerprints, anything like that?

1159
01:42:16,347 --> 01:42:17,371
No.

1160
01:42:20,018 --> 01:42:21,349
No, we don't.

1161
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:34,197
Here's that number.

1162
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:37,361
Very good, Mr. Gordon.

1163
01:42:37,569 --> 01:42:39,400
May l use your phone, please?

1164
01:42:47,545 --> 01:42:49,570
Sure you can use my phone.

1165
01:42:51,082 --> 01:42:52,242
Freeze!

1166
01:42:53,084 --> 01:42:57,145
Put your hands over your head and turn around. Spread your legs.

1167
01:42:58,323 --> 01:42:59,585
Spread your legs!

1168
01:42:59,791 --> 01:43:01,520
Put your hands in the back--

1169
01:43:01,726 --> 01:43:03,193
Freeze!

1170
01:44:15,767 --> 01:44:17,758
Hey!

1171
01:44:37,722 --> 01:44:40,054
Are you there?

1172
01:44:41,459 --> 01:44:44,587

1174
01:45:05,617 --> 01:45:06,982
Yes!

1175
01:45:08,686 --> 01:45:09,948
FBl.

1176
01:45:10,154 --> 01:45:11,451
You're safe.

1177
01:45:11,656 --> 01:45:14,625
Safe, shit! Get me out of here!

1178

01:45:41,519 --> 01:45:42,679
Oh, my God.

1183
01:45:45,123 --> 01:45:49,150
Catherine, l'm gonna get you out. But right now, you listen to me.

1184

l've gotta leave. l'll be right back.

1185
01:45:53,362 --> 01:45:55,762
No! Don't you leave me here, you fucking bitch! No!

1186
01:45:55,798 --> 01:45:57,322
Don't you leave me here!

1187
01:45:57,533 --> 01:46:00,263
This guy is fucking crazy!

1188
01:46:02,638 --> 01:46:07,473
Wait! l gotta get out of here!

1189

Wait! Don't go! Please!

1192
01:46:19,021 --> 01:46:20,318

1193

Oh, God! Oh, God!

1194

1195
01:49:50,900 --> 01:49:53,198


1196
01:50:20,996 --> 01:50:23,464
-You okay? -Gunpowder. lt's nothing, l'm okay.

1197

1198
01:50:26,902 --> 01:50:30,599

Okay. Sure.

Dr. Lecter?

1218

Don't bother with a trace. l won't be on long enough.
