00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:14,640
<i>this past Sunday, there was an article about</i>

3
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:18,060
<i>the first black punk rock group
called Death in the '70s.</i>

4
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:20,479
<i>And they found these old recordings.</i>

5
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:22,648
<i>And they have an album
that they put out now.</i>

6
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:25,818
<i>They have pictures of these guys
back in the '70s. One of them died.</i>

7
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,155
<i>And now I'm dying to hear
this fucking group's music.</i>

8
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:30,740
<i>- Should be good.</i>
<i>- RADIO HOST 2: What were they called?</i>

9
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,743
<i>RADIO HOST 1: They were called Death.

of the Death story is almost like the tease</i>

<i>at the beginning of a movie trailer.</i>

13
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,693
Three black guys, in the '70s,

14
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:10,738
from Detroit, Michigan, blood brothers.

15
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,242
Three black cats from Detroit,
played heavy, punk, rock 'n' roll.

16
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:18,913
<i>ALICE COOPER: It's pretty hard to
be black playing rock in Detroit.</i>

17
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,831
'Cause they were sort of stereotyped into...

18
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,750
You had to be Motown, if you were black.

19
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:29,423
Death's music was definitely
ahead of its time.

20
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:32,718
They really predated
what we know as the punk movement.

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,598
Nobody was making music like that in '73.

22
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,268
They have to be properly credited
as being visionaries.

25
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,779

26
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,281
that it didn't manage to find a way
to come out then.

27
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,828
They're kind of like the Unknown Soldiers
of rock.

28
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,831
<i>BEN BLACKWELL: They were recordings
that were simply put away.</i>

29

<i>There's been hardcore history sitting up
in that attic, and no one's known about it.</i>

30
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:09,505
Thirty years after the fact,
we're just now discovering this band

31
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,924
that had been sort of lying in wait.

32
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:21,517
It's such a great story and it's, uh...

33
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:24,186
It's punk rock.

34
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:43,766

- Okay.

- You remember Death.
- I'm still here.

They telling the story about our old band

42
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,579
that we used to drive you all crazy
with all of our loud music.

43
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,790
Yeah, I remember that.

44
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,625

57

<i>David was born the second.

60
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,897
<i>And, um, I came along.</i>

61
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,524
<i>EARL JR; I am indeed the eldest,</i>

62
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:19,361
and that was ingrained in them also,
because I'd say,

63
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:23,407
"Never forget, I'm second in command
to Moms and Pop."

70
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,514
I mean, we all became versed in the Word.

73

<i>DANNIS: My old man instilled into us

He calls it the death triangle.

317

Okay, since he's proclaiming
the leader of the band...

328
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:10,723
We said, "David, we need a contract." Okay?

329
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:16,479
So, well, David takes the yellow pages,
nails it to the wall

330
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,940
and go gets a dart.

331
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,610
He opens it to the music section,

332
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:27,198

and music offices and...

333
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:31,953
He opens the yellow pages,
nails it to the wall, takes the dart...

334
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:37,291
<i>And the dart lands
on Groovesville Productions.</i>

335
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,420
He said, "Those are the guys
we're gonna call."

336
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,263
DANNIS: There's Groovesville Productions.

337
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,183
I always remember these yellow bricks,

338
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,978
'cause this is where the studio was.

339
00:23:57,812 --> 00:24:00,982
<i>DANNIS: Now, Groovesville,
they were</i> a <i>production company</i>

341
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,949
<i>And their leader was Don Davis,</i>

342
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:13,494
who was just a Detroit music mogul.

343
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:16,789
Hello. My name is Don Davis.

344
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,502
I am a record producer.

on the door and just...

00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:42,148
Yeah.

353
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,241

I met the Hackney brothers.

357
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:06,380

for Brian Spears.

00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:16,390
- This is the room.
- Still got the original furniture.

380
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:30,256
The moment that that band

00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:35,970
fired up those instruments,
it was just amazing.

431
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:46,929

in public, back up your brother.

437

00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:41,317
If we give them the title to our band,

444
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,653

give them everything else.

Okay, I would have.

452
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,891
But my spirit was telling me,
"Go with your brother."

00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:49,004
<i>and then we eventually
bought even musical gear.</i>

491
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,634
<i>DANNIS: When we first got to Burlington,</i>

492
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:57,137
<i>David, he wanted to introduce
the town to the band.</i>

493
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:00,641
Well, David went down the street.

494
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,101
On each pole,

495
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,478
he put a Death poster.

496
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:08,190
So I think he had
about 500 of them printed up.

497
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:12,069
<i>DANNIS: I mean, the cops must've just went
by every pole he was at</i>

498
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:15,280
<i>and just grabbed them off,
'cause when the cop came to the door,</i>

499
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:18,826
he said, "This is a peaceful town,

500
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:21,411
"and we don't have gangs here."

501
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,997
<i>That's when I said,
"Dave, you better come to the door, man.</i>

502
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,834
<i>"They think you're about
to start a street gang."</i>

503
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,294
You know, he says,
"No, man, this is a musical group.

504
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:30,587
"This is all about music."

505
00:35:30,671 --> 00:35:34,842
He says, "Well, if you wanna get anywhere
around here, you'll change that name."

506
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:45,894
You know, after he left, I just closed the door
and I said "That's it, man. I'm just tired of it."

507
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:50,732
<i>I'm tired of the rejection,
I'm tired of the snide comments.</i>

508
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:52,192
<i>I'm done With it.</i>

509
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:57,865
<i>BOBBY: We just understood
that we tried our best with Death.</i>

510
00:35:57,948 --> 00:36:02,536
<i>We hung in there from '73 to 1980,</i>

511
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:05,914
dealing with rejection for our name,
rejection for our music,

512
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,834
rejection for the fact that
we were black and playing rock 'n' roll,

513
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,211
rejection for the fact
that our music was too fast,

514
00:36:11,295 --> 00:36:13,255
rejection for... So many rejections.

515
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:18,427
<i>DANNIS: David, he felt the rejection
as well as we did. I mean, he knew.</i>

516
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:22,723
I think it was David who came up
with the name 4th Movement.

517
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:27,728
<i>We didn't even listen to the concept
or why he came up with the name.</i>

518
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:31,064
It wasn't Death, so me and Bob
was just like, "Yeah, okay.

519
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:32,274
"That's a good name."

(SONG PLAYING)

521
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:51,168
We just decided to take our rock 'n' roll sound

522
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:52,961
and give it a spiritual concept.

523
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:57,633

(LAUGHS)

525
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:31,166
<i>DANMS: There was a campus newspaper
and the name of the article was,</i>

526
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:34,211
<i>"Rock 'n' Roll, Hold The Religion, Please."</i>

527
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:36,755
<i>And they were saying
how good the music was,</i>

528
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:40,926
<i>but how they didn't like the religious
aspects that went along with it.</i>

529
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,766
<i>BOBBY: After all the rejection that
we 'd been through with Death,</i>

530
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:50,477
there's this big old article
in The <i>Cynic</i> saying,

531
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,188
"Nice music, hold the religion,"
with our picture by it.

532
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:57,192
<i>DANNIS: Dave took it really personally,</i>

533
00:37:57,276 --> 00:38:00,654
<i>and I think he had just got fed up
with the rejection, too.</i>

534
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,991
That's when the homesick
for Detroit thing started to brewing up.

535
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:05,701
He wanted to go back to Detroit.

536
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:09,496
He really, literally,
wanted to bottle up everything

537
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:13,166
and take it with him, including us.
He wanted us to fold up.

538
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:16,670
But at the time, I mean,
I had brought my wife, Tammy.

539
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:23,719
<i>And she had just had a little baby,
little Bobby.</i>

540
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,561
We just didn't wanna pack up
and go back to Detroit, you know?

541
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,565
So David went back to Detroit.

542
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:52,622
Well, lam Heidi Simpson,
and David Hackney was my late husband.

543
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:54,541
Well, let me see.

544
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,085
Well, we moved from

545
00:38:58,295 --> 00:39:01,340
Vermont to Detroit in 1982.

546
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,510
<i>He wasn't working at that time. I know that.</i>

547
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:11,224
He was staying at home
and playing his music to himself

548
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,978
and trying to figure out
what he wanted to do himself.

549
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:20,233
<i>He just wasn't no typical working person
that, like, out there, doing the 9:00 to 5:00.</i>

550
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:23,111
<i>And he was a dreamer.</i>

551
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,572
<i>(CLEARS THROAT) He liked, uh...</i>

552
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:29,743
<i>He would sit out on the porch
and just look in the...</i>

553
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,871
In the clouds in the sky

554
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,749
<i>and make pictures out of the clouds.</i>

556
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:49,763
<i>BOBBY: We went for about two or three years
without a guitar player.</i>

557
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:53,058
Yeah, we would practice the same way
every day that we always did.

558
00:39:57,521 --> 00:40:01,900
<i>DANNIS: 'Cause we was always on the idea
that David would come back.</i>

559
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:07,989
As time went on, we finally realized,
"Well, maybe Dave's not coming back."

560
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:12,035
So me and Bob stayed here
and that's how Lambsbread was born.

562

563
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:31,513
People love this music.

564
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,016
It's ruled by the bass and drums

565
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,561
and that's all we got right now.

566
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:42,232
So it was a no-brainer.
That's how we gravitated to reggae.

now that we got rid of that, you know,

577

No, man, we were sitting back
waiting for you to come,

As a kid, that's all I knew...

I just knew them as reggae musicians.
And I just knew them as Lambsbread.

We did the same thing that our mom
and dad did for us.

<i>We just made music available to them.</i>

593

My Uncle Dannie taught me
all the basics of drumming,

594
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:47,732
which was really awesome.

<i>DANNIS: And I used to bring him
behind the drum set,</i>

and kind of move his hands for him.

<i>And then when Bob had his other sons...</i>

598
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:06,251
When they saw how Bobby played the drums,
I guess, you know,

599
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:07,961
all of them wanted to play the drums.

600
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:11,715
Well, I was always, you know,
influenced by my Uncle Dannie and Bobby,

601
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:14,759
'cause, you know, he always had
drums laying around the room

<i>and I kind of caught on to that.</i>

603
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:20,265
Yeah, my dad and uncle,
they always had a very strong,

604

serious musical connection,

605
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:25,812
<i>and that was something that made
a profound impact on me.</i>

606
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,314
Bobby came to me one day and says,

"Hey, man, you're turning
all of my sons into drummers."

00:43:37,157 --> 00:43:41,995
My Uncle Dave, he was really my...
One of my favorite uncles.

610
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:46,666
<i>And he was just always so crazy
and so out there and so out of the box.</i>

<i>JULIAN: He just had the best sense

<i>and I used to love talking to him.</i>

613
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:56,635
You know? 'Cause he was just so lively
and so funny, you know?

614
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,261
He was like a child.

00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:04,267
<i>BOBBY: The thing that was kind of sad was
I never got to see him at his prime.</i>

I only... 'Cause he was...

617
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:10,899
He really got into the bottle,
he really got into alcohol.

618
00:44:11,024 --> 00:44:15,445
So most of the time that I saw him,
he was always drunk.

619
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:17,238
<i>BOBBY: David thought...</i>

620

<i>He's one of these genius types,

I mean, the demons get to you.
You know what I mean?

622
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:24,871
The demons get to you.

00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:29,042
<i>EARL JR.: And David was gonna do

624
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:33,171

625
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,383
<i>And nobody was gonna mess with him.</i>

626
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,552
<i>And the more that people tried to</i>

627
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:43,765
correct him, if you will, or change him,

628
00:44:44,808 --> 00:44:48,144
the worse it became, okay?

629
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:50,438
He was a visionary.

630
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,732
He had a plan,

631
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:57,237
and that plan didn't go through
the way he wanted it to.

632
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:02,742
And I think part of his drinking then
was from not being able to

633
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:06,746
<i>fully express what he wanted to do
with his music and his art.</i>

634
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:12,919
This is part of the diary
that David had started,

635
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:15,255
and he's just talking about,

636
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:19,342
uh, one day of his life.

637
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:22,846
"Check the dreams that are in your mind.

638
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:26,015
"Take a flight to see
which ones are really there.

"Open up your eyes and see

"The world we know shall be no more."

641
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:37,944
That was when David revealed that

642
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:45,577
his music would not come forth
until after he had left this earth.

643
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:51,750
<i>I think he was just feeling
like he wanted to leave back then.</i>

644
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:54,002
<i>He always was in another world, like,</i>

645
00:45:54,127 --> 00:45:57,756
he just kept saying that
he didn't wanna be here anymore.

646
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:16,024
<i>Hendrix.
Uh, no, he was never an idol.</i>

some friends of mine were writing

784
00:55:43,132 --> 00:55:45,551
about the history of band T-shirts.

785
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:48,929
I know that Jello's
a really huge punk collector.

786
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:51,140
And this collector friend of mine said,

787
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:53,893
"Jello supposedly has a box
of the Death single."

788
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:57,480
<i>And I said, "What's the Death single?"</i>

789
00:55:57,563 --> 00:56:00,941
He's like, "Oh, man, it's this all-black

00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:02,777
"and it's super hard to find."

791
00:56:06,906 --> 00:56:11,994
Das was a guy that I'd seen
coming into the record store often.

792
00:56:12,078 --> 00:56:13,954
He never talked. He was always very quiet.

793
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:15,539
But he would buy really cool records.

794
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:18,125
"I got a record you might be interested in.
I'll just give you a copy.

795
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:21,921
"It's friends of mine that

"You know, just got out of college."

797
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:26,592
So I gave him a brand-new copy
of the Death record and he just like,

798
00:56:26,634 --> 00:56:27,635
"Where'd you get that?"

799
00:56:27,927 --> 00:56:31,639
He says, "Hey, you know,

<i>when we were releasing those Death 45s.</i>

807
00:56:52,118 --> 00:56:56,163
And David had commissioned Don
to do the artwork.

808
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:58,833
And he wanted a triangle in the clouds.

809
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,627
But, you know, of course,
they never had the money

810
00:57:01,669 --> 00:57:03,129
to follow through on any of the stuff,

811
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:05,423
so, basically, I did all this artwork for them,

812
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:08,342
but they couldn't pay me,
so they traded me records.

813
00:57:08,426 --> 00:57:09,552
That's what happened.

814
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:16,225
So now I got these clean copies
of the Death 45 from Das.

00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:30,281
it's Detroit, it's punk rock, it's hard to find
and not a lot of people know about it.

818
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:34,410
I mean, this hits all of my checklist,
you know, this is something meant for me.

819
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:35,661
So there it is,

820
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:37,830
<i>Politicians In My Eyes, which is the A-side,</i>

821
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:40,958
<i>and, uh, Keep On Knocking,</i>
which <i>is the B-side.</i>

822
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:45,504
Later that night, another record collector

823
00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:48,966
told me the value of the record.

824
00:57:49,008 --> 00:57:50,885
He had heard of it, and I mentioned it to him.

825
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:53,679
And he told me that, "Oh, you know,
do you know what that thing's worth?

826
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:55,181
"That's a really valuable record."

827
00:57:57,016 --> 00:58:00,060
<i>So Matt Smith puts the 7-inch on eBay</i>

828
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:03,814
and he had it on eBay,
"Buy It Now", 800 bucks.

829
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:13,616
How I discovered the Death album was I saw
an American unknown punk compilation,

830
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:16,285
and Death was featured on Side B.

831
00:58:17,328 --> 00:58:20,706
<i>I was completely blown away
with such a great song, you know?</i>

832
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:23,584
<i>I was asking myself,
"Why was this band not known?"</i>

833
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:26,128
I knew I had to find that record.

834
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:31,133
<i>About a month after I had heard
that compilation,</i>

835
00:58:31,217 --> 00:58:34,094
<i>I was eBaying and I noticed one for sale.</i>

836
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:36,722
<i>And it was for $800.</i>

837
00:58:37,598 --> 00:58:41,393
The old digs, Archer Record Pressing
in Detroit, if they knew

838
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:44,355
that something they pressed 30 years ago...

839
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:48,692
Gosh, 35 almost, selling for 800 bucks.

840
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:54,114
Why would anybody pay $800
for an old <i>Keep</i> On <i>Knocking?</i>

841
00:58:54,532 --> 00:58:57,952
I mean, if I had one,
I would've gave the guy one.

842
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:06,418
<i>BLACKWELL: The idea of something
that's been unheard, that excited me.</i>

843
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:09,713
This needs to come out.
People need to hear this. This is important.

844
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,341
<i>I make some copies, I send them out</i>

845
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:15,302
<i>to people that I know
and to some people I don't know.</i>

846
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:19,557
One of the people I made a CD-R for
was by the name of Henry Owings

847
00:59:19,598 --> 00:59:22,184
and he runs Chunklet magazine in Atlanta.

848
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:26,605
And he posted them on Chunklet's website.

849
00:59:34,822 --> 00:59:38,617
BOBBY <i>JR.: Julian moves out to California
and he is out there just, you know,</i>

850
00:59:38,701 --> 00:59:41,412
<i>traveling, hanging out with friends and stuff.</i>

851
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:44,456
JULIAN: And I had a friend,
a roommate who, uh...

852
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:47,543
She used to go to a lot of parties,
and she used to go to all these parties,

853
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:51,255
where these DJs would spin
all these collectors' classics,

854
00:59:51,297 --> 00:59:54,550
and, you know, unheard of, just anomalies,

855
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:57,720
and rare hidden gems and things like that.

856
00:59:57,803 --> 01:00:01,682
She came home one time, and was, like,
just ranting and raving

857
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:04,226
about all this new music that she had heard.

858
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:07,521
And she wouldn't stop going on
about this band Death.

859
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,530
I did a little bit of research,

860
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:20,659
and it didn't take long before I came across
this website called Chunklet

861
01:00:21,452 --> 01:00:24,830
that Ben Blackwell had posted two songs.

862
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,416
<i>(POLITICIANS IN MY EYES PLAYING)</i>

863
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:36,717
<i>I heard that song, Politicians In My Eyes,</i>

864
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,261
and I heard my dad's voice,

865
01:00:39,345 --> 01:00:42,890
and it was unmistakable, unmistakably his.

866
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:45,559
(some CONTINUES)

867
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:56,403
<i>JULIAN: And it turns out that there were these
three black brothers in Detroit in the '70s,</i>

868
01:00:57,237 --> 01:00:58,822
by the name of Hackney.

869
01:00:58,864 --> 01:00:59,865
(GIGGLES)

870
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:01,450
And I call up my dad.

871
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,411
(PHONE RINGING)

872
01:01:05,746 --> 01:01:08,082
<i>BOBBY: And he called me up and he says,
"Dad, do you realize</i>

873
01:01:08,624 --> 01:01:12,211
<i>"that they're playing your music
at underground parties here?"</i>

874
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:14,713
And I'm like,
"Are you talking about Lambsbread?"

875
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:17,049
You know, I thought he was talking
about our current reggae band.

876
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:20,511
And he says, "No, Dad."
He says, "You were in a band in the '70s

877
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:23,097
"from Detroit called Death."

878
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,224
And then I just got quiet.

879
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:30,229
You know, "Dad, were you in a band
in the '70s called Death?"

880
01:01:30,813 --> 01:01:33,273
<i>He says, "Politicians In My Eyes,
Keep On Knocking?"</i>

881
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:35,067
And when he said that, I said, "That's us."

882
01:01:35,651 --> 01:01:37,236
I'm like, "Dad!

883
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:39,905
(SHOUTING) "Why didn't you tell me?"

884
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:41,031
(LAUGHS)

885
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:43,409
And then my brother would call up me
and be like,

886
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:44,576
"Bobby, you're not gonna believe this.

887
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:48,205
"Like, Dad and Uncle Dannie and Uncle Dave
were in this band called Death."

888
01:01:48,247 --> 01:01:50,833
<i>He was telling me about the music,
about how amazing it was.</i>

889
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:54,712
It was like the best rock 'n' roll
he's ever heard.

890
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:58,132
And then I play the MP3

891
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:59,758
and my jaw drops.

892
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:00,926
MAN: (ON RECORDING) <i>Death!</i>

893
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:02,845
<i>(FREAK/N OUT PLAYING)</i>

894
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:12,604
Like, I just couldn't believe
what I was hearing.

895
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:15,524
Like, my eyes started to tear up,

896
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:19,403
the hairs were standing up
on the back of my neck.

897
01:02:20,112 --> 01:02:21,572
I started shaking.

898
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:24,491
(SONG PLAYING)

899
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:34,960
BOBBY <i>JR.: I just couldn't believe it
because once I heard it,</i>

900
01:02:35,294 --> 01:02:38,630
I knew, I just knew it was them. I could feel it.

901
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:41,633
I was like,
"This is my dad and my two uncles."

902
01:02:41,884 --> 01:02:45,095
(SONG PLAYING)

903
01:02:50,893 --> 01:02:52,644
<i>URIAN: I was one of the first people
to hear the record.</i>

904
01:02:53,312 --> 01:02:56,690
And I could not believe, I like...
it was unbelievable.

905
01:02:56,940 --> 01:03:00,652
(SONG PLAYING)

906
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:06,700
<i>JULIAN: It was raw punk,
and I did not believe it at all.</i>

907
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:09,077
It was really a dream come true.

908
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:17,878
I was like, "I can't believe that
I know that I'm listening to

909
01:03:18,003 --> 01:03:21,173
"the best rock 'n' roll music I've ever heard,

910
01:03:21,215 --> 01:03:22,633
"and I'm the only person
that knows about this.

911
01:03:22,674 --> 01:03:25,177
"I need..." Like, I started calling my friends.

912
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:29,431
Bobby calls me up and he says...
I didn't pick up, he left me a message.

913
01:03:29,515 --> 01:03:32,643
He says, "I gotta talk to you.
I got some crazy news for you."

914
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:36,772
And he said, "Yeah, you know, I found out
that my dad was in kind of a protopunk band

915
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:38,982
"in, like, the early, mid-'70s."
And I was like, "What?"

916
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:42,486
Then I made him a copy and told him
to listen to it.

917
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:45,113
And he had the same reaction I did.

918
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:49,243
So I post on various message boards,
punk rock message boards.

919
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:53,872
<i>And posted a long story about everything
I knew about Death,</i>

920
01:03:53,956 --> 01:03:57,626
<i>put up links to the songs,
and just wanted to share this, 'cause I said,</i>

921
01:03:57,709 --> 01:03:59,378
<i>"Other people need to hear these songs."</i>

922
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:03,006
That post circulated all over the Internet.

923
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:09,304
To the point where it got the attention
of Robert Manis, who is a record collector.

924
01:04:09,388 --> 01:04:14,309
I was still freaking out over that record,
you know, I'd listen to it all the time.

925
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:19,231
<i>And I was just blogging.
I typed in "Hackney Death,"</i>

926
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:21,400
and this blog came up.

927
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:26,530
So I dropped everything that I was doing,
and I talked to,

928
01:04:26,572 --> 01:04:28,740
you know, a couple of the guys at Drag City.

929
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:34,997
RIAN <i>MURPHY: Well, we were
talking to Robert Manis,</i>

930
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:40,085
<i>and so Robert sent over some MP3s
of the Death single.</i>

931
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:45,883
It's like '70s garage
like you've never heard it before.

932
01:04:46,425 --> 01:04:51,430
Just made us really excited to wanna be
involved with the record, if we could.

933
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:55,601
<i>So, naturally, the thought turned to,
"Reissuing a single is cool,</i>

934
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:58,562
<i>"but if there's more material
of a similar nature,</i>

935
01:04:59,146 --> 01:05:00,689
"then you can reissue an album."

936
01:05:00,772 --> 01:05:02,482
And that seemed to be

937
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:05,027
the next question.
ls there an album out there?

938
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:07,195
Where are these guys? Do they still exist?

939
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:12,618
BOBBY: Let's give thanks.

940
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:15,203
Lord, we thank you for this food
that we are about to receive

941
01:05:15,287 --> 01:05:19,082
and we thank you for our family
and all that you do for us.

942
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:22,002
In Jesus' name, we thank you. Amen.

943
01:05:22,753 --> 01:05:23,921
Amen.

944
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:24,963
Amen.

945
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:30,802
All right.

946
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:39,186
What I do for a living is
I work at St. Michael's College.

947
01:05:40,062 --> 01:05:42,689
I'm on the late-night maintenance crew.

948
01:05:52,366 --> 01:05:56,495
<i>I've been able to give my kids the choice
of going to college, through this job.</i>

949
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:59,247
<i>I've been able to buy a house.</i>

950
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:04,878
To me, it's a good job
that I can do while, uh...

951
01:06:04,962 --> 01:06:07,172
While I struggle as a musician.

952
01:06:09,174 --> 01:06:12,803
<i>Getting the call from Drag City
was really exciting,</i>

953
01:06:14,346 --> 01:06:16,765
because every musician lives for that day,

954
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:19,309
when you get the call
from the record company.

955
01:06:20,352 --> 01:06:23,313
<i>But after the excitement of that part wore off,</i>

956
01:06:24,231 --> 01:06:29,069
you know, it's just bringing up
a whole Wellspring of emotion.

957
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:35,826
<i>After starting a new band and after just
creating a whole new life, all of a sudden,</i>

958
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:39,246
<i>you know, something from your past
just pulls you back.</i>

959
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:41,707
<i>And says, "Hey, what about this?"</i>

960
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:54,386
<i>BOBBY: This is where we store stuff.</i>

961
01:06:56,263 --> 01:06:59,850
For years and years,
most of the Death tapes were right here,

962
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:03,520
in this little bin here.

963
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:09,901
This is just the way it was on that day
when Bobby called me up and said,

964
01:07:09,985 --> 01:07:13,196
"Dad, please tell me
you have those master tapes."

965
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:15,782
And they were sitting up here,

966
01:07:15,866 --> 01:07:17,409
just like this.

967
01:07:17,701 --> 01:07:20,287
I was in such a blur about everything.

968
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:24,416
"I can't believe that I'm up here
looking for the Death tape."

969
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:29,713
You know, I mean,
that within itself was so surreal for me.

970
01:07:31,923 --> 01:07:33,425
This right here

971
01:07:33,467 --> 01:07:38,096
is the original finish master tape

972
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:44,436
that was recorded
at United Sound's production studios.

973
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,105
As you can see,

974
01:07:48,023 --> 01:07:50,901
that's my brother David's writing right there.

975
01:07:51,318 --> 01:07:55,113
And that was what he wanted to call
the whole... The album, that's what he...

976
01:07:55,864 --> 01:07:57,657
<i>"Death, For The Whole World To See."</i>

977
01:07:58,867 --> 01:08:00,702
Course, he put his signature triangle,

978
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:04,956
which basically represented
the whole Death concept.

979
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:09,044
This is the tape
and this tape has been through

980
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:11,797
quite a bit, you know?

981
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:15,050
It's kind of, like,
older than any of my children.

(SINGING)

983
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:34,319
Then, before I knew it,
the album was released.

(LAUGHS)

985
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:39,032
So this is the album, right here.

986
01:08:39,324 --> 01:08:42,994
Released on Drag City Records,
February 17th, 2009.

987
01:08:44,121 --> 01:08:46,081
After all these years...

988
01:08:46,164 --> 01:08:48,416
Three cats, three young dudes,

01:08:49,209 --> 01:08:51,670

992
01:08:57,884 --> 01:08:59,845
It's... It's incredible.

993
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:03,890
I don't know of a story like that.

994
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:07,102
I don't know of one.

<i>BOBBY". When the album came out,</i>

996
01:09:16,987 --> 01:09:19,281
<i>I felt emotional, I felt happy.</i>

997
01:09:19,698 --> 01:09:23,702
<i>I was happy for us, that our music
was finally getting recognized.</i>

998
01:09:23,785 --> 01:09:26,371
<i>I was sad, you know,
because David was not here to see it.</i>

999
01:09:26,413 --> 01:09:30,917
<i>You know, he wanted to see
something like that really significant happen.</i>

1000
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:32,711
<i>DANNISI It's kind Of hard,</i>

1001
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:38,175
when you talk about this, because you kind of
hear Dave's voice in the back of your head.

1002
01:09:40,135 --> 01:09:41,219
<i>You know, he said it.</i>

1003
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:44,931
<i>He said the world's gonna come
looking for this music one day.</i>

1004
01:09:45,015 --> 01:09:48,393
<i>I'm still hearing in the back of my voice
all the things Dave said,</i>

1005
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:53,190
and they're coming true
and, you know, it just feels weird.

1006
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:02,616
The album was released,
but since nobody really heard...

1007
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,784
Not many people heard
the Death album quite yet,

1008
01:10:05,911 --> 01:10:09,998
<i>what we decided to do, me, Julian and Urian,</i>

1009
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:12,209
<i>was pay tribute to Death</i>

1010
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:16,379
by covering the album and, like,
playing it live.

<i>JULIAN: The Death songs
needed to have an audience</i>

1014
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:48,703
and that's been too long, you know.
It'd been 34 years

1015
01:10:48,787 --> 01:10:51,289
since the songs had been heard by anybody.

1016
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:56,920
BOBBY <i>JR.: We did</i> a <i>lot of campaigning,
you know?</i>

1017
01:10:56,962 --> 01:10:59,297
<i>Like, we were out there spreading the word.</i>

1018
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:03,468
We were almost like musical missionaries
for Death, in a way.

1019
01:11:09,224 --> 01:11:11,017
<i>I remember the first show that we played.</i>

1020
01:11:11,101 --> 01:11:15,063
<i>It was packed and people
were just really excited and happy.</i>

1021
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:20,485
It was like this rush
of spiritual energy running through our veins.

1022
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:23,530
<i>It was pretty much like speaking
to Uncle Dave again.</i>

1023
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:25,782
It was like saying, "Hey, what's up,
Uncle Dave? How you doing?"

1024
01:11:25,824 --> 01:11:26,992
Like, "I haven't seen you in a while."

1025
01:11:27,075 --> 01:11:29,327
When we played those songs,
that's what it felt like.

1026
01:11:29,369 --> 01:11:31,538
It felt like he was there with us again.

01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:48,680

put out as Rough Francis.

<i>'Cause it's like this band is
all happening because of Uncle Dave.</i>

01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:58,648
<i>Like, we're channeling his music,
his energy, his art.</i>

1036
01:11:59,024 --> 01:12:00,734
It has to be called Rough Francis.

BOBBY <i>JR.: When we were
playing one of the songs,</i>

1048
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:55,663
I looked over
and I saw my father and my mom,

1049
01:12:55,747 --> 01:12:57,749
and they were both hugging and crying.

you know?</i>

<i>Thanks a lot. We are Rough Francis.</i>

1056
01:13:29,489 --> 01:13:31,366
<i>MIKE RUBIN: Rough Francis was
really impressive.</i>

1057
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:34,285
They were a real force on stage

1058
01:13:34,369 --> 01:13:37,956
in performing

1059
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:41,584
their father's and uncles' music.

1060
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:46,881
<i>I know my piece began with Bobby
sort of beaming back at the bar.</i>

1061
01:13:47,298 --> 01:13:49,968
<i>You know, he's got three of his sons on stage</i>

1062

<i>and his brother Dannie there,
and his wife Tammy's there.</i>

1063
01:13:53,972 --> 01:13:56,182
And, I mean, it was like a family reunion.

But the...
You know, and the missing member is...

1065
01:13:59,436 --> 01:14:02,105
Was his brother, David,
who was then present...

1066
01:14:02,147 --> 01:14:05,859
You know, whose presence was
really felt through his music.

when I saw the story in The New York Times,</i>

1068
01:14:10,822 --> 01:14:13,992
it was pretty mind-blowing
to see it on that scale.

1069
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:17,328
I was just blown away
when that article actually came out.

1070
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:20,248
<i>And there was like a picture, like,
this big of Rough Francis.</i>

1071
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:25,420
I was like, "Oh, my goodness, we're in
The New York Times, like half the page."

1072
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:28,131
I've never heard from so many people.

1073
01:14:28,173 --> 01:14:33,386

and, you know, like I said, my dentist.

Matt Sweeney, in New York City,</i>

01:14:38,725 --> 01:14:40,685
<i>and I think he saw an article
in</i> The Times <i>or something.</i>

1076
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:42,437
So he actually sent me a disk.

1077
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,980
And I was checking it out,
and I was like, "Wow."

1078
01:14:44,022 --> 01:14:46,232
You know, how did I not know about this?

1079
01:14:46,316 --> 01:14:47,734
I was like, "Man, this is bad-ass."

1080
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:50,278
And it's just one of those great music stories.

1081
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:52,614
It's one of those things that
keeps you going to the record store,

1082
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:54,657
hoping for another great story like that.

1083
01:14:54,699 --> 01:14:56,784
It's why you listen to music.

1084
01:14:56,868 --> 01:14:59,704
It instantly became a favorite record,
you know?

1085
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:04,459
It was sort of... it literally popped out
of the speakers and it had an energy to it

1086
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:07,670
and a musicianship that sort of blew my mind.

1087
01:15:08,296 --> 01:15:10,256
MICK COLLINS: <i>When I</i> got to hearing
Politicians In My Eyes,

1088
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:14,385
it was like an immediate, like,
"This is one of the greatest songs

1089
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:15,845
"I have heard in quite some time."

1090
01:15:15,887 --> 01:15:18,515
And it really was
quite an electrifying recording.

1091
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:21,893
Ramones got all the glory
for what this is right here.

1092
01:15:21,976 --> 01:15:24,938
And this is pretty much the Ramones,

1093
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:27,607
but two years earlier.

1094
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:32,028
There's no doubt on that record,
there's only conviction.

1095
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:34,072
There's only full-hearted conviction.

1096
01:15:34,197 --> 01:15:36,074
And that's really what

1097
01:15:37,492 --> 01:15:39,744
makes it rock 'n' roll.

1098
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:45,458
<i>MICKEY LEIGH: When I heard it, I just
couldn't believe that I 'd never heard it before.</i>

1099
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:48,253
It was the predecessor

1100
01:15:48,294 --> 01:15:51,881
of what punk became.

1101
01:15:51,923 --> 01:15:55,218
And that was what also compelled me

1102
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,512
to really wanna search them out,

1103
01:15:57,595 --> 01:16:00,848
no matter, you know, how long it took me

1104
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:04,018
to find somebody

1105
01:16:04,102 --> 01:16:05,728
who had a number for these guys.

1106
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:10,942
<i>BOBBY JR.: Joey Ramone's brother,
he ended up tracking me down,</i>

1107
01:16:11,025 --> 01:16:14,112
and he invited Death and Rough Francis

1108
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:17,365
to come play
Joey Ramone's Annual Birthday Bash.

1109
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:21,703
And I'm like, "Well, Mickey, you know, Death,
they haven't really played any...

1110
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:22,996
"They haven't played live yet.

1111
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:25,290
"I don't even know if they would be into it."

1112
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,918
<i>And then I called my dad.</i>

1113
01:16:29,377 --> 01:16:33,047
<i>You know, at first, he didn't really know
if he wanted to go forth with the project,</i>

1114
01:16:33,131 --> 01:16:38,803
just because of all the emotional ties
they have with it and, you know,

1115
01:16:38,886 --> 01:16:43,057
they always wanted to be really respectful
to my Uncle Dave.

1116
01:16:43,308 --> 01:16:46,853
Yeah, we were very reluctant,
because, you know, we didn't wanna...

1117
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:49,814
We just didn't want to do it without David.

1118
01:16:50,148 --> 01:16:52,400
It actually took a few weeks

1119
01:16:53,610 --> 01:16:57,155
for us to really take this thing kind of serious,

1120
01:16:57,196 --> 01:17:01,659
because we had to answer the question
about who's gonna play the guitar.

1121
01:17:03,328 --> 01:17:05,872
<i>BOBBY: David said,
"I don't leave any children in this world,</i>

1122
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:08,916
<i>"you gotta remember
my songs are my children."</i>

1123
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:14,213
You know, I'm committed to
taking care of those children.

1124
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:18,176
And at the time,
we was working with Bobbie Duncan,

1125
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:20,386
who we had found

1126
01:17:20,678 --> 01:17:23,056
<i>to be a guitar player in Lambsbread.</i>

1127
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,391
<i>As far as the look, he fits.</i>

1128
01:17:25,475 --> 01:17:29,020
I mean... But should we throw
this kind of a load on the dude?

1129
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:30,855
<i>BOBBIE DUNCAN: Bobby says, like,
"You know,</i>

1130
01:17:30,897 --> 01:17:32,357
<i>"Bob, something's happened," you know?</i>

1131
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:37,612
He was, like, you know, he didn't even
seem like he could really, uh,

1132
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:39,030
put it all together, man, but...

1133
01:17:39,072 --> 01:17:40,948
'Cause it was just, like,
such a big thing to him.

1134
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,785
<i>He says, "Man, I hope you wanna do it, man,"
you know, and stuff.</i>

1135
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:46,079
And so I listened to the CD.

1136
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:49,707
And he said, "Not only is the album awesome,
man," he says, "but I'm gonna..."

1137
01:17:49,749 --> 01:17:52,377
He says, "I'm gonna try to do David justice.

1138
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:56,547
<i>"I'm gonna try to live up to the standard
that he put down on that album."</i>

1139
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:59,634
<i>DANNIS: And when we got together
with Bobbie Duncan, we figured,</i>

1140
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:02,428
<i>"Well, you know Keep On Knocking,
that's kind of an easy tune.</i>

1141
01:18:02,512 --> 01:18:05,807
"We could just, you know,
throw that out there first

1142
01:18:06,224 --> 01:18:07,725
"and see what happens, you know."

<i>BOBBY: We started playing the music.</i>

1145
01:18:16,693 --> 01:18:21,656
We stopped. And Bobbie, he says,
"Guys, did I do something wrong?

1146
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:24,409
"If I did something wrong, I'm sorry."

1147
01:18:26,536 --> 01:18:29,539
And when we turned back around
to answer Bobbie,

1148
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:33,042
he saw that we both had tears
streaming down our eyes.

1149
01:18:33,918 --> 01:18:36,462
(SOBBING) Because he was playing it.

1150
01:18:44,345 --> 01:18:46,139
It sounded like Dave.

1151
01:18:46,848 --> 01:18:49,851
And I had to get up and leave out the studio.

1152
01:18:50,184 --> 01:18:51,936
Okay, I just took a 10-minute break.

1153
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:55,773
I just, you know, went out there
and did my crying on the side of the studio,

1154
01:18:55,815 --> 01:18:59,986
and I said, "I don't know
what's going on here, Lord." I said a prayer.

1155
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:04,365
I said, "I don't know what's going on here,
Lord, but you gotta tell me how to walk.

1156
01:19:04,449 --> 01:19:06,075
"You gotta tell me how to walk."

1157
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:09,287
That's when I realized
it was more than just, like, playing guitar

1158
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:11,914
and covering songs, or doing a gig,
you know?

1159
01:19:11,956 --> 01:19:14,125
I realized this is a spiritual thing.

1160
01:19:14,167 --> 01:19:15,918
This is, you know, a deep thing.

1161
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:18,963
You have to understand, at that session,

1162
01:19:19,005 --> 01:19:20,590
at that time...

1163
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:23,634
That was the first time

1164
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:26,888
that we had played that music

1165
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:32,310

DANNIS: You know, I mean, really,
we are enjoying this wonderful thing.

1193
01:23:50,067 --> 01:23:51,444
But, for us,

1194
01:23:51,819 --> 01:23:53,988
it's a beautiful thing
and we're having a lot of fun,

1195
01:23:54,071 --> 01:23:57,742
but we do carry a tremendous burden
with us, in that, um,

1196
01:23:57,783 --> 01:24:02,955
David had predicted all along that this music
would catch on throughout the world.

1197
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:06,250
That's one of the things, I think,
that's really bittersweet with us,

1198
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:08,836
is that he, um,

1199
01:24:08,919 --> 01:24:11,505
never got, physically, the opportunity to see

1200
01:24:12,006 --> 01:24:13,924
his prediction come true.

would hear this one.</i>

<i>DANNIS: This whole thing is happening,
not because of my faith,</i>

1204
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:31,192
but all this is happening
because of Dave's faith.

1205
01:24:31,776 --> 01:24:34,111
Dave is the one who said
all this stuff was gonna happen.

1206

1207

But now we're living it, and that's what's
making everything so strange.

You know?

1209
01:24:44,747 --> 01:24:46,373
It's like a movie.

1210
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,797
And we are the unwitting stars of the movie.

1215
01:25:05,559 --> 01:25:07,103
That's strange.

And here we are taking
this journey once again.

1219

<i>It's kind of reminiscent of the journey
that I took in 2000,</i>

and we had to go to his funeral.</i>

and that spirit is what we really are.

1245

<i>He convinced us.</i>

Not only did he convince us, but he...

He inspired us, because we had
the chance to change the name.

1258
01:30:28,715 --> 01:30:34,888
And I think David was the prime example

1259
01:30:37,015 --> 01:30:38,809
of what the Lord said when he said,

1260
01:30:38,851 --> 01:30:43,981
"What does it profit a man to gain
the whole world and to lose his soul?"

1261
