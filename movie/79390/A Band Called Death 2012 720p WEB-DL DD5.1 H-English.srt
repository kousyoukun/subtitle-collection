1: The New York Times, 2 00:00:13,047 --&gt; 00:00:15,180 <I>this
past Sunday,</I> <I>there was an article about</I> 3 00:00:15,182 --&gt;
00:00:18,117 <I>the first black</I> <I>punk rock group</I> <I>called
Death in the '70s.</I> 4 00:00:18,119 --&gt; 00:00:20,552 <I>And they
found</I> <I>these old recordings.</I> 5 00:00:20,554 --&gt;
00:00:22,721 <I>And they have an album</I> <I>that they put out now.</I>
6 00:00:22,723 --&gt; 00:00:25,891 <I>They have pictures</I> <I>of
these guys back</I> <I>in the '70s. One of them died.</I> 7
00:00:25,893 --&gt; 00:00:29,228 <I>And now I'm dying to hear</I>
<I>this fucking group's mus.</I> 8 00:00:29,230 --&gt; 00:00:30,996
<I>Should be good.</I> <I>RADIO HOST 2:</I> <I>What were they called?</I>
9 00:00:30,998 --&gt; 00:00:33,832 RADIO HOST 1: <I>They were called
Death.</I> <I>RADIO HOST 3: Death.</I> 10 00:00:44,277 --&gt;
00:00:46,879 <I>(WHERE DO WE GO FROM HER?</I> <I>PLAYING)</I> 11
00:00:58,758 --&gt; 00:01:02,961 HENRY ROLLINS: <I>The quick</I>
<I>version of the Death story</I> <I>is almost like the tease</I> 12
00:01:02,963 --&gt; 00:01:04,630 <I>at the beginning</I> <I>of a
movie trailer.</I> 13 00:01:04,632 --&gt; 00:01:07,833 Three black
guys, in the '70s, 14 00:01:07,835 --&gt; 00:01:10,803 from Detroit,
Michigan, blood brothers. 15 00:01:10,805 --&gt; 00:01:16,075 Three
black cats from Detroit, played heavy, punk, rock 'n' roll. 16
00:01:16,077 --&gt; 00:01:18,977 ALICE COOPER: <I>It's pretty hard to
be black</I> <I>playing rock in Detroit.</I> 17 00:01:18,979 --&gt;
00:01:20,913 'Cause they were sort of stereotyped into... 18
00:01:20,915 --&gt; 00:01:22,815 You had to be Motown, if you were
black. 19 00:01:26,653 --&gt; 00:01:29,688 Death's music was
definitely ahead of its time. 20 00:01:29,690 --&gt; 00:01:32,791
They really predated what we know as the punk movement. 21
00:01:34,727 --&gt; 00:01:37,663 Nobody was making music like that in
'73. 22 00:01:37,665 --&gt; 00:01:41,333 They have to be properly
credited as being visionaries. 23 00:01:41,335 --&gt; 00:01:44,069
(SINGING) 24 00:01:46,439 --&gt; 00:01:50,275 ELIJAH WOOD: <I>You
have</I> <I>a record that is so perfect</I> <I>in its innovation,</I>
25 00:01:50,277 --&gt; 00:01:51,877 <I>it makes it</I> <I>all the
more shocking</I> 26 00:01:51,879 --&gt; 00:01:54,346 that it didn't
manage to find a way to come out then. 27 00:01:56,349 --&gt;
00:01:58,917 They're kind of like the Unknown Soldiers of rock. 28
00:01:58,919 --&gt; 00:02:01,954 BEN BLACKWELL: <I>They were
recordings that</I> <I>were simply put away.</I> 29 00:02:01,956 --&gt;
00:02:06,558 <I>There's been hardcore history</I> <I>sitting up in
that attic,</I> <I>and no one's known about it.</I> 30 00:02:06,560
--&gt; 00:02:09,595 Thirty years after the fact, we're just now
discovering this band 31 00:02:09,597 --&gt; 00:02:11,997 that had
been sort of lying in wait. 32 00:02:18,404 --&gt; 00:02:21,607 It's
such a great story and it's, uh... 33 00:02:22,842 --&gt;
00:02:24,243 It's punk rock. 34 00:03:40,787 --&gt; 00:03:43,822
Welcome to my neighborhood. 2240 Lillibridge. 35 00:03:43,824 --&gt;
00:03:45,724 This is where Death was born. 36 00:03:47,126 --&gt;
00:03:50,596 This is our old friend... No. 37 00:03:50,598 --&gt;
00:03:53,065 ...that we grew up with. This is Kathleen. She lives
right here. 38 00:03:53,067 --&gt; 00:03:56,435 They telling the
story about Death. Okay. 39 00:03:56,437 --&gt; 00:03:57,836 You
remember Death. I'm still here. 40 00:03:57,838 --&gt; 00:03:59,972
No! 41 00:03:59,974 --&gt; 00:04:02,774 They telling the story about
our old band 42 00:04:02,776 --&gt; 00:04:05,711 that we used to
drive you all crazy with all of our loud music. 43 00:04:05,713 --&gt;
00:04:07,946 Yeah, I remember that. 44 00:04:07,948 --&gt;
00:04:09,681 I remember that, yes. 45 00:04:12,051 --&gt;
00:04:13,418 Oh, yeah, there you go! 46 00:04:13,420 --&gt;

David... David... You know what? 48 00:04:24,530 --&gt; 00:04:28,333
But you know what? That was my boy, though. That was my boy. 49
00:04:28,335 --&gt; 00:04:30,002 He was all right. 50 00:04:30,004
--&gt; 00:04:31,903 <I>My name is</I> <I>Dannis Hackney.</I> 51
00:04:31,905 --&gt; 00:04:35,140 I played the drums, and I was born
and raised 52 00:04:35,142 --&gt; 00:04:37,876 in the Motor City,
Detroit, Michigan. 53 00:04:37,878 --&gt; 00:04:40,045 Well, I
remember when I... You all were teenagers, uh... 54 00:04:40,047 --&gt;
00:04:41,913 DANNIS: That's right. That's very right. 55 00:04:41,915
--&gt; 00:04:43,415 Yeah. Right, yeah? 56 00:04:43,417 --&gt;
00:04:46,618 <I>I'm Bobby Hackney.</I> <I>I am a bass player.</I> 57
00:04:46,620 --&gt; 00:04:49,888 My parents, Earl Vonlee Hackney 58
00:04:49,890 --&gt; 00:04:53,025 and Majora Florida Hackney, two
beautiful people. 59 00:05:00,500 --&gt; 00:05:04,336 <I>I was the
youngest o,</I> <I>uh, four boys.</I> 60 00:05:04,338 --&gt;
00:05:07,472 <I>Our oldest brothe</I> <I>was Earl.</I> 61
00:05:07,474 --&gt; 00:05:11,376 <I>David was born the second</I> <I>And
then it was Dannis.</I> 62 00:05:11,378 --&gt; 00:05:14,479 <I>And,
um, I came along.</I> 63 00:05:14,481 --&gt; 00:05:15,947 EARL JR.: <I>I
am indeed the eldest,</I> 64 00:05:15,949 --&gt; 00:05:19,418 and
that was ingrained in them also, because I'd say, 65 00:05:19,420 --&gt;
00:05:23,488 &quot;Never forget, I'm second in command to Moms and
Pop.&quot; 66 00:05:29,929 --&gt; 00:05:33,965 DANNIS: <I>Spirituality
plays</I> <I>into our life right from</I> <I>the beginning of our
roots.</I> 67 00:05:33,967 --&gt; 00:05:37,402 <I>You know, our dad</I>
<I>was a Baptist minister.</I> 68 00:05:37,404 --&gt; 00:05:38,637
We're preacher's sons. 69 00:05:38,639 --&gt; 00:05:41,106 (LAUGHS)
70 00:05:41,108 --&gt; 00:05:43,842 EARL JR.: <I>Being a minister's
kid</I> <I>taught us the Word,</I> 71 00:05:43,844 --&gt;
00:05:45,377 <I>from Genesis</I> <I>to Revelation.</I> 72
00:05:45,379 --&gt; 00:05:48,180 I mean, we all became versed in the
Word. 73 00:05:48,182 --&gt; 00:05:49,848 BOBBY: <I>He always</I>
<I>told us, you kno,</I> 74 00:05:49,850 --&gt; 00:05:51,917 <I>if
you try your best in e</I> <I>to keep your promise to d</I> 75
00:05:51,919 --&gt; 00:05:56,488 and give God time enough to keep His
promise to you. 76 00:05:56,490 --&gt; 00:06:00,759 DANNIS: <I>My old
man instilled into us</I> <I>to back up your brother.</I> 77
00:06:00,761 --&gt; 00:06:03,729 So all of our lives we grew up with
this idea 78 00:06:03,731 --&gt; 00:06:06,365 that, you know, we
gotta back up your brother. 79 00:06:06,367 --&gt; 00:06:09,868 <I>We
made a pact</I> <I>with each other that</I> <I>we would never fight,</I>
80 00:06:09,870 --&gt; 00:06:12,537 <I>we would never do anything</I>
<I>to hurt each other.</I> 81 00:06:12,539 --&gt; 00:06:14,272 We
were all close. 82 00:06:14,274 --&gt; 00:06:18,443 I mean, we all
were very, very close. 83 00:06:18,445 --&gt; 00:06:21,079 BOBBY:
Moms, you got so many grandchildren, you can't keep up now. 84
00:06:21,081 --&gt; 00:06:22,247 MAJORA: I don't try. 85 00:06:22,249
--&gt; 00:06:23,682 (ALL LAUGHING) 86 00:06:25,585 --&gt;
00:06:28,954 I got eight kids. I'm proud of every one of them. 87
00:06:28,956 --&gt; 00:06:30,889 BOBBY: That's right. That's right.
88 00:06:30,891 --&gt; 00:06:33,158 Love every one of them. 89
00:06:33,160 --&gt; 00:06:34,326 Your son, David... 90 00:06:34,328
--&gt; 00:06:35,527 BOBBY: You're gonna see everybody came... 91
00:06:35,529 --&gt; 00:06:37,596 I don't know what David's doing up
there, 92 00:06:37,598 --&gt; 00:06:39,631 but there's a lot of good
things going on 93 00:06:39,633 --&gt; 00:06:41,867 in our lives,
because of all his things. 94 00:06:41,869 --&gt; 00:06:43,001 Um,
yeah. 95 00:06:43,003 --&gt; 00:06:44,069 It is. 96 00:06:44,071 --&gt;
00:06:47,172 Yeah, I know that out of... David... 97 00:06:47,174 --&gt;
00:06:49,474 We talk about Dave all the time. 98 00:06:49,476 --&gt;
00:06:51,309 I know. You said... I know. 99 00:06:51,311 --&gt;
00:06:53,879 You know, me and Viv, we talk about Dave. 100
00:06:53,881 --&gt; 00:06:54,946 Yeah. 101 00:06:54,948 --&gt;
00:06:56,782 Some of the things he did. 102 00:06:56,784 --&gt;
00:06:59,651 Oh! (ALL LAUGH) 103 00:06:59,653 --&gt; 00:07:01,787
DANNIS: <I>I mean,</I> <I>we were kind of</I> <I>crazy kids.</I> 104
00:07:01,789 --&gt; 00:07:04,122 <I>We thought of some games</I> <I>that
was really weird.</I> 105 00:07:04,124 --&gt; 00:07:07,726 I remember
one time we was having a squirt gun fight. 106 00:07:07,728 --&gt;
00:07:10,829 <I>You know,</I> <I>Dave hid behind the garage</I> <I>and
pissed in his.</I> 107 00:07:10,831 --&gt; 00:07:14,032 (LAUGHS) 108
00:07:14,034 --&gt; 00:07:17,536 You know, just... Just some of
Dave's pranks, you know. 109 00:07:17,538 --&gt; 00:07:19,671 EARL
JR.: <I>David was kind of creative</I> <I>when it comes to the...</I>
110 00:07:19,673 --&gt; 00:07:21,740 I mean, he would put together
some makeshift stuff 111 00:07:21,742 --&gt; 00:07:25,143 that just
would work that... That you wouldn't believe. 112 00:07:25,145 --&gt;
00:07:26,578 (LAUGHS) 113 00:07:26,580 --&gt; 00:07:28,914 DANNIS: <I>He
took</I> <I>the telephone one time</I> 114 00:07:28,916 --&gt;
00:07:31,216 <I>and pulled wires</I> <I>and he pinched wires,</I> 115
00:07:31,218 --&gt; 00:07:34,119 <I>and the next thing you know,</I>
<I>you pick up the phone, it's..</I> 116 00:07:34,121 --&gt;

actually have tapes of this. 119 00:07:42,196 --&gt; 00:07:45,764
David used that to scare people. 120 00:07:45,766 --&gt; 00:07:47,866

right in that corner over there. 145 00:09:16,957 --&gt; 00:09:19,791

00:09:58,296 <I>Then David tuned in</I> <I>to John Lennon playing</I>
<I>the guitar and...</I> 161 00:09:58,298 --&gt; 00:10:00,231 <I>And
it was David who</I> <I>rallied us to, you know,</I> 162 00:10:00,233
--&gt; 00:10:02,133 <I>be a band and</I> <I>get together and...</I>
163 00:10:02,135 --&gt; 00:10:03,969 And that made him the leader.
164 00:10:03,971 --&gt; 00:10:05,937 BOBBY: That's your first drum.
This is my first drum. 165 00:10:05,939 --&gt; 00:10:09,174 MAN:
What? Jesus Christ. Very first drum. 166 00:10:09,176 --&gt;
00:10:12,644 (LAUGHS) Right here. 167 00:10:12,646 --&gt;
00:10:15,146 So I used to put two knives, two butter knives, on here
168 00:10:15,148 --&gt; 00:10:17,182 to make it sound like a snare.
169 00:10:17,184 --&gt; 00:10:19,651 DANNIS: <I>One time</I> <I>we
had some good</I> <I>luck in our family</I> 170 00:10:19,653 --&gt;
00:10:22,487 <I>and our mother</I> <I>got a settlement</I> <I>from a
car accident.</I> 171 00:10:22,489 --&gt; 00:10:24,856 <I>And
suddenly</I> <I>we had some money.</I> 172 00:10:24,858 --&gt;
00:10:29,361 And she gave us kind of a choice of what we wanted to
do. 173 00:10:29,363 --&gt; 00:10:33,498 First thing we did was went
to Manny's Music, man. 174 00:10:33,500 --&gt; 00:10:35,533 Manny's

Rickenbacker guitar</I> <I>and a Fender guitar.</I> 176 00:10:42,442
--&gt; 00:10:45,443 David bought a brand-new Fender guitar. 177
00:10:45,445 --&gt; 00:10:48,046 Bob went and bought himself an
acoustic amplifier, 178 00:10:48,048 --&gt; 00:10:51,549 so I had to
have the best drums I could find. 179 00:10:51,551 --&gt;
00:10:54,953 I went and bought me a Slingerland set of drums. 180
00:10:54,955 --&gt; 00:10:58,790 BOBBY: <I>I had a bass,</I> <I>Dannis
had some drums,</I> <I>David, his guitar.</I> 181 00:10:59,859 --&gt;

187 00:11:16,777 --&gt; 00:11:19,110 whether we wanted to be a funk
band or a rock band. 188 00:11:19,112 --&gt; 00:11:20,812 (MUSIC

a fire, you know,</I> <I>add a little funk in there</I> 190
00:11:29,322 --&gt; 00:11:31,489 and just keep on going, like an

00:11:36,862 --&gt; 00:11:40,131 But then the Who came to town. 193
00:11:40,133 --&gt; 00:11:43,268 <I>And when Dave went</I> <I>down to
see them,</I> 194 00:11:43,270 --&gt; 00:11:45,570 he was like,
&quot;That's it.&quot; 195 00:11:45,572 --&gt; 00:11:49,374 You know,
&quot;We gotta play this music. This is the music we gotta play.&quot;

00:11:55,981 --&gt; 00:11:58,550 David, every time I would leave,
man, 198 00:11:58,552 --&gt; 00:12:01,352 he would have that stuff
playing. 199 00:12:01,354 --&gt; 00:12:04,089 He'd just be laying
there, listening. 200 00:12:04,091 --&gt; 00:12:07,125 And then I'd
come back and the same thing would be playing. 201 00:12:08,961 --&gt;
00:12:10,595 DANNIS: <I>You know,</I> <I>when I saw Alice Cooper,</I>
202 00:12:10,597 --&gt; 00:12:13,198 <I>it was like, you know,</I>
<I>&quot;All bets are off, man.&quot;</I> 203 00:12:13,200 --&gt;
00:12:16,735 To me, if we ain't playing this, then I ain't gonna be

206 00:12:24,511 --&gt; 00:12:27,645 That's what David called it, he
said, &quot;It's pure rock 'n' roll, man.&quot; 207 00:12:27,647 --&gt;
00:12:30,115 Not like a lot... You're gonna have your one hit, 208
00:12:30,117 --&gt; 00:12:34,986 but the pure rock 'n' roll is what
they don't play over the radio, you know? 209 00:12:34,988 --&gt;
00:12:37,188 That's what David always said. 210 00:12:37,190 --&gt;

here. 214 00:12:51,371 --&gt; 00:12:53,671 Only something like this
could come from the mind of my brother. 215 00:12:53,673 --&gt;

00:12:59,846 --&gt; 00:13:03,314 This was my station, over here.
David was right over here. 218 00:13:07,686 --&gt; 00:13:10,054 And
this was all Dannis' drums. 219 00:13:12,725 --&gt; 00:13:17,162 And
then we had our PAs. We just gutted the whole room. 220 00:13:17,164
--&gt; 00:13:22,734 And we just made it into this little rock 'n'
roll haven. 221 00:13:22,736 --&gt; 00:13:27,238 If it wasn't for our
mom... She let us turn our whole entire room 222 00:13:27,240 --&gt;

00:13:30,143 --&gt; 00:13:33,444 DANNIS: She got behind everything we
wanted to do. 224 00:13:33,446 --&gt; 00:13:37,081 While I'm on

agreement with us.</I> 226 00:13:38,952 --&gt; 00:13:40,618 <I>She
said, &quot;Hey, look,</I> <I>3:00 to 6:00 is your time.</I> 227
00:13:40,620 --&gt; 00:13:43,087 &quot;After 6:00, you gotta cut it

00:13:52,798 --&gt; 00:13:55,800 David, he could practice for hours
232 00:13:55,802 --&gt; 00:13:58,169 and hours and hours, literally.
233 00:14:02,341 --&gt; 00:14:04,976 BOBBY: <I>He got to the point</I>
<I>to where he played along</I> 234 00:14:04,978 --&gt; 00:14:07,912
<I>with just about every album</I> <I>that was in our collection.</I>
235 00:14:07,914 --&gt; 00:14:11,583 So he was learning Queen, he was
learning the Who. 236 00:14:11,585 --&gt; 00:14:17,055 David had a
slogan. He said, &quot;If I could play chords like Peter Townsend 237
00:14:17,057 --&gt; 00:14:20,725 <I>&quot;and play lead</I> <I>like
Jimi Hendrix,</I> 238 00:14:20,727 --&gt; 00:14:23,461 &quot;I am the
ideal guitar player.&quot; 239 00:14:23,463 --&gt; 00:14:25,763
David's amp was always positioned right here, 240 00:14:25,765 --&gt;
00:14:27,098 because he liked it like that... 241 00:14:27,100 --&gt;
00:14:30,668 So he could, you know, roust up the neighbors. 242
00:14:33,172 --&gt; 00:14:36,207 And then there was like a... Some
girls... 243 00:14:36,209 --&gt; 00:14:39,377 We'd be practicing so
loud, that after we're done with a song, 244 00:14:39,379 --&gt;
00:14:42,847 we could hear all this loud knocking on the door. 245
00:14:42,849 --&gt; 00:14:44,916 And that was them trying to get in.
246 00:14:44,918 --&gt; 00:14:49,988 One day this transpired and

--&gt; 00:15:17,282 and, oh, man, they were... 254 00:15:17,284 --&gt;
00:15:20,652 They sent people down the street holding their head. 255
00:15:23,555 --&gt; 00:15:26,457 DANNIS: <I>You know,</I> <I>we would
start to practice</I> <I>and the doors would slam</I> 256
00:15:26,459 --&gt; 00:15:28,092 <I>and the cop s</I> <I>would pull
u,</I> 257 00:15:28,094 --&gt; 00:15:30,528 <I>because we know y</I>

into, like, 260 00:15:34,534 --&gt; 00:15:36,200 groups like Earth,

you know,</I> <I>here we are in the</I> <I>middle of all of this</I>
262 00:15:39,773 --&gt; 00:15:41,673 playing rock 'n' roll. 263
00:15:41,675 --&gt; 00:15:45,576 And, I mean, it was just... It
wasn't a rock 'n' roll culture. 264 00:15:45,578 --&gt; 00:15:47,245
White boy music! 265 00:15:52,418 --&gt; 00:15:55,219 I mean, the
more people tried to talk to us about changing, 266 00:15:55,221 --&gt;
00:15:58,790 I think the deeper we went into rock 'n' roll. 267

275 00:16:50,209 --&gt; 00:16:55,046 BOBBY: <I>My dad, Earl V.</I>
<I>Hackney, died.</I> 276 00:16:55,048 --&gt; 00:16:59,884 Though it
was an accident, I think it impressed us a lot in our lives 277
00:16:59,886 --&gt; 00:17:04,689 from then on, when they described to
us how he died. 278 00:17:04,691 --&gt; 00:17:06,391 DANNIS: <I>He
was an</I> <I>electric lineman,</I> 279 00:17:06,393 --&gt;
00:17:10,061 <I>so his job was to</I> <I>climb up the poles,</I> <I>fix
the wires.</I> 280 00:17:10,063 --&gt; 00:17:12,530 <I>I guess he had
a trainee</I> <I>with him one night.</I> 281 00:17:12,532 --&gt;
00:17:18,102 And this trainee, I guess, stuck his screwdriver in the
wrong place. 282 00:17:18,104 --&gt; 00:17:22,140 And he got shocked,
and it threw him off the pole. 283 00:17:22,142 --&gt; 00:17:25,576
So my dad races down the pole, you know, 284 00:17:25,578 --&gt;
00:17:27,311 throws him in the back of the car... 285 00:17:27,313
--&gt; 00:17:29,514 And they take off for the hospital. 286
00:17:29,516 --&gt; 00:17:33,751 But just so happened, a bar was
letting out. 287 00:17:33,753 --&gt; 00:17:36,554 And there was a
person who was drunk behind the wheel 288 00:17:36,556 --&gt;
00:17:39,657 and they swung right out in front of him. 289
00:17:39,659 --&gt; 00:17:44,262 And he slammed right into her and he
died instantly. 290 00:17:52,204 --&gt; 00:17:56,340 BOBBY: <I>I
mean, the last thing</I> <I>that he did before he left</I> <I>this
world was a noble deed.</I> 291 00:17:56,342 --&gt; 00:17:58,576 He
was trying to help someone. 292 00:18:09,121 --&gt; 00:18:12,390
BOBBY: <I>I think</I> <I>when my dad died,</I> 293 00:18:12,392 --&gt;
00:18:17,728 it had really a big effect on David, as it did all of
us. 294 00:18:17,730 --&gt; 00:18:21,999 Um, and David became
obsessed 295 00:18:22,001 --&gt; 00:18:25,570 with a lot of
spirituality. 296 00:18:25,572 --&gt; 00:18:31,142 Seeing our dad at
a funeral, I think really was for the first time 297 00:18:31,144 --&gt;
00:18:37,148 that we was up close and personal with dying, 298
00:18:37,150 --&gt; 00:18:39,851 and the fact that someone that you
love... 299 00:18:39,853 --&gt; 00:18:43,020 You're never gonna see
this person in this existence. 300 00:18:43,022 --&gt; 00:18:47,191
And that, I think, had a big effect on all of us, 301 00:18:47,193
--&gt; 00:18:49,527 but on David probably the most. 302 00:18:54,299
--&gt; 00:18:57,335 DANNIS: <I>Bobby was in</I> <I>school, I was at
work.</I> 303 00:18:57,337 --&gt; 00:19:00,071 <I>So when we get
home,</I> <I>David says,</I> 304 00:19:00,073 --&gt; 00:19:04,976
<I>&quot;Man, I got this great,</I> <I>great new idea</I> <I>for the
name of the band.&quot;</I> 305 00:19:04,978 --&gt; 00:19:08,012 So
he holds us in suspense. Let's run up to the room 306 00:19:08,014
--&gt; 00:19:11,516 <I>and find out what</I> <I>this great name is
that</I> <I>David then came up with.</I> 307 00:19:12,484 --&gt;
00:19:14,886 We're waiting with much suspense. 308 00:19:14,888 --&gt;
00:19:19,190 And as soon as he says, &quot;Yeah, this is the name,
dude. Death.&quot; 309 00:19:21,927 --&gt; 00:19:25,463 Death. Oh,
man. 310 00:19:25,465 --&gt; 00:19:29,600 DANNIS: <I>So me and Bobby</I>
<I>just kind of looked at</I> <I>each other as if to say,</I> 311
00:19:29,602 --&gt; 00:19:33,271 <I>&quot;This dude's gone</I> <I>way
off the deep end.&quot;</I> 312 00:19:33,273 --&gt; 00:19:35,673 I
know what I would do if somebody came up to me 313 00:19:35,675 --&gt;
00:19:38,142 talking about their band, the name of their band was
Death. 314 00:19:38,144 --&gt; 00:19:41,579 I'd be like, &quot;You
don't wanna... No, I don't wanna hear it.&quot; 315 00:19:41,581 --&gt;
00:19:43,447 DANNIS: <I>But there again,</I> <I>that old thing</I>
316 00:19:43,449 --&gt; 00:19:45,249 <I>in the back of</I> <I>your
head kicks in.</I> 317 00:19:45,251 --&gt; 00:19:48,519 <I>&quot;Back
up your brother.</I> <I>Back up your brother.&quot;</I> 318
00:19:48,521 --&gt; 00:19:52,023 BOBBY: <I>And David always</I> <I>said
that our name</I> <I>would have shock val.</I> 319 00:19:52,025 --&gt;
00:19:53,591 And we're like, &quot;Why would you say that?&quot; 320
00:19:53,593 --&gt; 00:19:57,128 He says, &quot;Because death is
real.&quot; 321 00:19:57,130 --&gt; 00:19:59,797 DANNIS: <I>He had so
much</I> <I>conviction, so much belief,</I> 322 00:19:59,799 --&gt;
00:20:03,034 <I>until we just</I> <I>went along with it.</I> 323
00:20:03,036 --&gt; 00:20:07,872 And that was right around the spring
of 1974. 324 00:20:07,874 --&gt; 00:20:10,474 Yeah, that's when we
became Death. 325 00:20:10,476 --&gt; 00:20:11,676 MAN: (ON
RECORDING) <I>Death!</I> 326 00:20:11,678 --&gt; 00:20:13,878 <I>(LET
THE WORLD TUR</I>PLAYING) 327 00:20:26,892 --&gt; 00:20:30,461
(SINGING) 328 00:20:47,613 --&gt; 00:20:53,851 This picture right
here was taken in 1975. 329 00:20:55,454 --&gt; 00:20:59,624 And from
our mother's back yard in Detroit. 330 00:20:59,626 --&gt;
00:21:03,194 David looked up into the sky and he saw a triangle. 331
00:21:03,196 --&gt; 00:21:05,529 As you can see, there's a triangle
right there. 332 00:21:06,365 --&gt; 00:21:11,669 And also there's a
face. 333 00:21:11,671 --&gt; 00:21:16,941 David said that that was
the face of God watching over the triangle. 334 00:21:16,943 --&gt;
00:21:20,111 And he used to tell us that was a message to us, you
know. 335 00:21:20,113 --&gt; 00:21:24,415 Hey, this is what Dave was
in tune to. This is what he was all about. 336 00:21:43,669 --&gt;
00:21:48,439 DANNIS: <I>David wanted</I> <I>to put a positive spin</I>
<I>on death.</I> 337 00:21:48,441 --&gt; 00:21:50,675 <I>It's kind of
like birth</I> 338 00:21:50,677 --&gt; 00:21:54,145 It's not a good
or a bad thing, it's just a thing. 339 00:21:54,147 --&gt;
00:21:57,148 BOBBY: Yeah, well, see, this right here was David's
concept. 340 00:21:57,150 --&gt; 00:21:59,483 He calls it the death
triangle. 341 00:21:59,485 --&gt; 00:22:04,922 And what it basically
means is the three elements of life, 342 00:22:04,924 --&gt;
00:22:10,161 which is spiritual, mental, physical. 343 00:22:11,530
--&gt; 00:22:15,299 And this right here means that's the guiding
spirit. 344 00:22:15,301 --&gt; 00:22:19,704 And that's what David
said. This right here is God. 345 00:22:19,706 --&gt; 00:22:23,407
DANNIS: <I>The stuff that used</I> <I>to come out of his head was</I>
<I>just so, you know,</I> 346 00:22:23,409 --&gt; 00:22:27,011 <I>it
was original,</I> <I>but, you know,</I> <I>when you first heard it,</I>
347 00:22:27,013 --&gt; 00:22:28,946 it just sounded crazy. 348
00:22:49,668 --&gt; 00:22:52,436 DAVID: (ECHOING) <I>The ultimate
trip.</I> 349 00:22:54,306 --&gt; 00:22:55,639 <I>Death.</I> 350
00:23:01,513 --&gt; 00:23:03,147 DANNIS: <I>David...</I> 351
00:23:03,149 --&gt; 00:23:06,550 Okay, since he's proclaiming the
leader of the band... 352 00:23:06,552 --&gt; 00:23:11,489 We said,
&quot;David, we need a contract.&quot; Okay? 353 00:23:11,491 --&gt;
00:23:16,560 So, well, David takes the yellow pages, nails it to the
wall 354 00:23:17,729 --&gt; 00:23:19,430 and go gets a dart. 355
00:23:19,432 --&gt; 00:23:23,134 He opens it to the music section,
356 00:23:23,136 --&gt; 00:23:27,938 where you have all your
producers and music offices and... 357 00:23:27,940 --&gt;
00:23:32,042 He opens the yellow pages, nails it to the wall, takes
the dart... 358 00:23:33,645 --&gt; 00:23:37,348 <I>And the dart
lands on</I> <I>Groovesville Production</I> 359 00:23:37,350 --&gt;
00:23:40,484 He said, &quot;Those are the guys we're gonna call.&quot;
360 00:23:47,259 --&gt; 00:23:50,327 DANNIS: There's Groovesville
Productions. 361 00:23:51,663 --&gt; 00:23:54,365 I always remember
these yellow bricks, 362 00:23:54,367 --&gt; 00:23:57,802 'cause this
is where the studio was. 363 00:23:57,804 --&gt; 00:24:01,071 DANNIS:
<I>Now, Groovesville,</I> <I>they were a production compan</I> 364
00:24:01,073 --&gt; 00:24:06,677 that handled people like Johnnie
Taylor, The Dramatics. 365 00:24:06,679 --&gt; 00:24:10,080 <I>And
their CEO was Don Davi,</I> 366 00:24:10,082 --&gt; 00:24:14,084 who
was just a Detroit music mogul. 367 00:24:14,086 --&gt; 00:24:16,854
Hello. My name is Don Davis. 368 00:24:18,056 --&gt; 00:24:21,826 I
am a record producer. 369 00:24:21,828 --&gt; 00:24:24,795 I am a
music publisher. 370 00:24:24,797 --&gt; 00:24:29,033 And I am a
studio owner. 371 00:24:29,035 --&gt; 00:24:34,805 And just more
recently, I am the proud owner 372 00:24:34,807 --&gt; 00:24:38,442
of First Independence National Bank. 373 00:24:38,444 --&gt;
00:24:41,045 DANNIS: Maybe we should knock on the door and just...
374 00:24:41,047 --&gt; 00:24:42,346 Yeah. 375 00:24:42,348 --&gt;
00:24:45,115 <I>The Hackney brothers</I> <I>came in to my office,</I>
376 00:24:45,117 --&gt; 00:24:49,520 because before you get to Don
Davis, the producer, 377 00:24:49,522 --&gt; 00:24:52,456 you had to
come through the Groovesville office, 378 00:24:52,458 --&gt;
00:24:54,692 <I>which was my domain.</I> 379 00:24:55,894 --&gt;
00:24:58,429 Hey, how you doing? 380 00:24:58,431 --&gt; 00:25:01,165
I met the Hackney brothers. 381 00:25:01,167 --&gt; 00:25:06,537 And
played me some demos that I just thought were absolutely wonderful.
382 00:25:06,539 --&gt; 00:25:08,806 BOBBY: This was Brian Spears'
office, wasn't it? 383 00:25:08,808 --&gt; 00:25:13,811 This is the
room where Death auditioned for Brian Spears. 384 00:25:13,813 --&gt;
00:25:15,179 This is the room. 385 00:25:15,181 --&gt; 00:25:16,480
Still got the original furniture. 386 00:25:16,482 --&gt;
00:25:20,017 He had the tape... On this shelf... 387 00:25:20,019 --&gt;
00:25:21,485 On this shelf 388 00:25:21,487 --&gt; 00:25:24,622 he
had the reel-to-reel tape. 389 00:25:24,624 --&gt; 00:25:30,528 And
Brian sat in this... At this desk. 390 00:25:30,530 --&gt;
00:25:34,398 SPEARS: <I>I was just</I> <I>blown away by the energy</I>
<I>of David Hackney.</I> 391 00:25:34,400 --&gt; 00:25:39,336 He just
knew that this is what their destiny was gonna be. 392 00:25:39,338
--&gt; 00:25:43,474 DANNIS: <I>Through a couple</I> <I>of auditions,
we ended up</I> <I>signing with them.</I> 393 00:25:43,476 --&gt;
00:25:47,478 And it just so happens that they was running the
stellar, 394 00:25:47,480 --&gt; 00:25:52,383 legendary recording
studio of Detroit called United Sounds. 395 00:25:52,385 --&gt;
00:25:56,086 <I>I mean, if you were</I> <I>a musician in Detroit,</I>
<I>you knew about United Sounds.</I> 396 00:25:56,088 --&gt;
00:25:58,956 SPEARS: <I>Let's see, I can</I> <I>tell you the exact
date</I> <I>they were in the studio.</I> 397 00:25:58,958 --&gt;
00:26:00,925 <I>They were in the studio</I> 398 00:26:00,927 --&gt;
00:26:07,197 February the 18th, it was a Wednesday, in 1975. 399
00:26:07,199 --&gt; 00:26:11,368 &quot;Death and Legacy are in the
studio cutting.&quot; 400 00:26:11,370 --&gt; 00:26:13,504 (LAUGHS)
It's right here. 401 00:26:15,206 --&gt; 00:26:16,840 BOBBY: <I>We
used to just</I> <I>love to come here, man.</I> 402 00:26:16,842 --&gt;
00:26:21,612 This is where we spent the entire summer of 1975. 403
00:26:21,614 --&gt; 00:26:24,782 We spent it right around, in and
around this building, 404 00:26:24,784 --&gt; 00:26:27,851 recording
that Death album. 405 00:26:27,853 --&gt; 00:26:30,321 The moment
that that band 406 00:26:31,556 --&gt; 00:26:36,093 fired up those
instruments, it was just amazing. 407 00:26:36,095 --&gt;
00:26:37,161 MAN: <I>One, two, three, now!</I> 408 00:26:37,163 --&gt;
00:26:38,963 (PUNK MUSIC PLAYING) 409 00:26:46,237 --&gt;
00:26:49,540 <I>I think with every</I> <I>song that they played,</I>
410 00:26:49,542 --&gt; 00:26:53,410 <I>the energy level just</I>
<I>kept growing and growing,</I> 411 00:26:53,412 --&gt; 00:26:55,679
because they just wanted to show 412 00:26:55,681 --&gt; 00:27:02,453
every bit of talent that they had on every song. 413 00:27:02,455 --&gt;
00:27:04,855 <I>(POLITICIANS IN MY EYES</I> <I>PLAYING)</I> 414
00:27:15,467 --&gt; 00:27:17,001 SPEARS: <I>It was amazing to me,</I>
415 00:27:17,003 --&gt; 00:27:22,306 to see such young players 416
00:27:22,308 --&gt; 00:27:25,442 have so much to say through their
music. 417 00:27:51,169 --&gt; 00:27:53,904 BOBBY: <I>Course,</I> <I>we
were the loudest thing</I> <I>that they'd ever seen.</I> 418
00:27:53,906 --&gt; 00:27:56,774 David, he went in there and he
showed them 419 00:27:56,776 --&gt; 00:27:58,976 what his
double-stacked Marshalls could do. 420 00:27:58,978 --&gt;
00:28:00,044 Yeah. 421 00:28:00,046 --&gt; 00:28:03,480 And they were
like, &quot;Okay, we hear it. 422 00:28:03,482 --&gt; 00:28:04,715
&quot;Please turn it down.&quot; 423 00:28:04,717 --&gt; 00:28:06,150
(LAUGHS) 424 00:28:06,152 --&gt; 00:28:07,518 Exactly. 425
00:28:36,781 --&gt; 00:28:39,616 SPEARS: <I>Once we were</I> <I>pretty
much happy</I> <I>with the mixes,</I> 426 00:28:39,618 --&gt;
00:28:43,921 I grabbed Don Davis and I said to Don, 427 00:28:43,923
--&gt; 00:28:46,957 &quot;Look, you... You've gotta listen to these
guys.&quot; 428 00:28:46,959 --&gt; 00:28:51,929 I'm like, &quot;Brian,
have you lost your mind? 429 00:28:53,164 --&gt; 00:28:57,501 <I>&quot;Nobody
is goin</I> <I>to buy a song</I> 430 00:28:57,503 --&gt; 00:29:00,871
&quot;on a group called D-E-A-T-H. 431 00:29:02,774 --&gt;
00:29:04,875 &quot;What's the matter with you?&quot; 432 00:29:04,877
--&gt; 00:29:12,249 (STAMMERING) I know the name is gonna be a
drawback, 433 00:29:12,251 --&gt; 00:29:16,987 <I>but, you know, I
convinced</I> <I>Don that on his next trip,</I> <I>we need to start</I>
434 00:29:17,689 --&gt; 00:29:21,325 showing the group around. 435
00:29:21,327 --&gt; 00:29:26,363 BOBBY: <I>We got turned</I> <I>down
by every major</I> <I>label in the UK.</I> 436 00:29:28,600 --&gt;
00:29:31,034 <I>'Cause, I mean,</I> <I>we had gotten</I> <I>a
rejection letter</I> 437 00:29:31,036 --&gt; 00:29:33,570 <I>that
said we tried</I> <I>all these labels.</I> 438 00:29:33,572 --&gt;
00:29:37,374 <I>He says,</I> <I>&quot;As far as I'm concerned,</I>
<I>don't even look anymore.&quot;</I> 439 00:29:37,376 --&gt;
00:29:40,477 DANNIS: <I>He went all the way</I> <I>pretty much around
the wor440 00:29:40,479 --&gt; 00:29:42,412 looking for a contra.</I>
441 00:29:42,414 --&gt; 00:29:44,248 Everybody turned us down. 442
00:29:44,250 --&gt; 00:29:48,652 The name had really seemed to be a
roadblock. 443 00:29:53,358 --&gt; 00:29:56,293 So I got this 444
00:29:56,295 --&gt; 00:30:00,164 setting with Clive Davis. 445
00:30:00,166 --&gt; 00:30:03,700 <I>And it caused</I> <I>a very
interesting stir,</I> 446 00:30:03,702 --&gt; 00:30:05,969 because
they were really focused on this record, 447 00:30:05,971 --&gt;
00:30:08,005 and they wanted to get involved in it. 448 00:30:08,007
--&gt; 00:30:12,976 The first reaction was, &quot;Hey, this... You
know, great stuff.&quot; 449 00:30:12,978 --&gt; 00:30:17,514
Possibly we may be on the brink of a deal, 450 00:30:17,516 --&gt;
00:30:19,750 but there's one sticking point. 451 00:30:19,752 --&gt;
00:30:23,854 <I>Clive Davis expressed</I> <I>that he really didn't
car</I> 452 00:30:23,856 --&gt; 00:30:25,689 <I>for the name of the
band.</I> 453 00:30:25,691 --&gt; 00:30:29,793 Brian had told us, he
says, &quot;You guys might have a record deal, uh, 454 00:30:29,795
--&gt; 00:30:32,729 &quot;if you are willing to change the name.&quot;
455 00:30:35,767 --&gt; 00:30:38,635 DANNIS: <I>That sent</I> <I>David
into another play 456 00:30:38,637 --&gt; 00:30:40,838 because he had
his Death concec457 00:30:40,840 --&gt; 00:30:43,006 and the concept
went with the nae 458 00:30:43,008 --&gt; 00:30:47,277 and the band
went with the concept, and nothing could change!</I> 459 00:30:47,279
--&gt; 00:30:52,349 BOBBY: <I>David, in no uncertain</I> <I>terms,
just said, &quot;Tell</I> <I>Clive Davis to go to hell.&quot;</I> 460
00:30:52,351 --&gt; 00:30:57,221 DANNIS: Okay, so David, our
illustrious leader, turned the deal down. 461 00:31:02,527 --&gt;
00:31:04,361 When that came out of David's mouth, 462 00:31:04,363
--&gt; 00:31:07,598 me and Bob had nothing coming out of ours. 463
00:31:07,600 --&gt; 00:31:09,032 We were flabbergasted. 464
00:31:09,034 --&gt; 00:31:11,301 Even though we didn't agree with it,
465 00:31:11,303 --&gt; 00:31:15,272 in public, back up your brother.
466 00:31:15,274 --&gt; 00:31:18,876 But in private, we had a bitter
argument about that. 467 00:31:18,878 --&gt; 00:31:22,246 <I>&quot;Listen,
man,</I> <I>these guys wanna give us</I> <I>a $20,000 contract.&quot;</I>
468 00:31:22,248 --&gt; 00:31:25,482 <I>And in the '70s, you know,</I>
<I>that's a pretty big contra.</I> 469 00:31:25,484 --&gt;
00:31:27,918 We could've actually just went ahead and changed the
name. 470 00:31:27,920 --&gt; 00:31:31,588 I mean, how many times we
gonna get a contract like this? 471 00:31:31,590 --&gt; 00:31:33,857
And, you know, then Dave got mad at us. 472 00:31:37,028 --&gt;
00:31:42,065 If we give them the title to our band, 473 00:31:42,067
--&gt; 00:31:45,435 Dave said you might as well give them everything
else. 474 00:31:45,437 --&gt; 00:31:48,538 DANNIS: <I>He always</I>
<I>believed in the music,</I> <I>and I have to admit,</I> 475
00:31:48,540 --&gt; 00:31:51,108 <I>a bit more than me</I> <I>or Bob
did,</I> 476 00:31:51,110 --&gt; 00:31:54,711 because, you know, we
were willing to make concessions. 477 00:31:54,713 --&gt;
00:31:57,714 Dave was absolutely not. 478 00:31:57,716 --&gt;
00:32:02,786 And he stuck to his guns. He stuck to his guns, man. 479
00:32:02,788 --&gt; 00:32:05,956 Yeah, I would've changed it in a
split second. 480 00:32:06,658 --&gt; 00:32:08,458 Okay, I would
have. 481 00:32:09,794 --&gt; 00:32:13,964 But my spirit was telling
me, &quot;Go with your brother.&quot; 482 00:32:18,336 --&gt;
00:32:21,505 <I>You know, we just went</I> <I>in the office one day
and..</I> 483 00:32:21,507 --&gt; 00:32:27,311 <I>Brian told us</I>
<I>that Don has decided</I> <I>to put a release on us.</I> 484
00:32:27,313 --&gt; 00:32:29,346 David just stood there and calmly
asked them, 485 00:32:29,348 --&gt; 00:32:31,281 he says, &quot;Can I
have the masters?&quot; 486 00:32:31,283 --&gt; 00:32:33,483 (LAUGHS)
487 00:32:33,485 --&gt; 00:32:35,953 &quot;Why not just give us our
music and let us walk?&quot; 488 00:32:35,955 --&gt; 00:32:38,288 <I>And
Brian said,</I> <I>&quot;Hey, no problem&quot;</I> 489 00:32:38,290
--&gt; 00:32:42,125 SPEARS: <I>And I was able to</I> <I>arrange to
get the masters</I> 490 00:32:42,127 --&gt; 00:32:44,194 <I>turned
back over</I> <I>to the group.</I> 491 00:32:44,196 --&gt;
00:32:46,697 So we took those master tapes that he gave us 492
00:32:46,699 --&gt; 00:32:51,468 and we printed up 500 45s. 493
00:32:59,344 --&gt; 00:33:01,044 BOBBY: <I>And the reason</I> <I>we
pressed those 500,</I> 494 00:33:01,046 --&gt; 00:33:04,247 <I>'cause
we wanted to</I> <I>get radio airplay.</I> 495 00:33:04,249 --&gt;
00:33:08,518 And it was frustrating, because the rock stations that
we loved, they would play it, 496 00:33:08,520 --&gt; 00:33:11,254
but very sporadically. 497 00:33:11,256 --&gt; 00:33:15,225 <I>We
never could</I> <I>get them to play it enough</I> <I>to really make a
difference.</I> 498 00:33:15,227 --&gt; 00:33:17,594 And it would
happen every time we'd tell somebody. 499 00:33:17,596 --&gt;
00:33:19,262 They'd say, &quot;Well, what's the name of the band?&quot;
500 00:33:19,264 --&gt; 00:33:20,998 And, you know, we'd kind of...
501 00:33:21,000 --&gt; 00:33:22,632 (SIGHS HEAVILY) 502 00:33:22,634
--&gt; 00:33:27,571 Do one of those and then we'd tell them the name
of the band. 503 00:33:27,573 --&gt; 00:33:30,774 And we'd get the
same old reaction that we were expecting to get. 504 00:33:31,976 --&gt;
00:33:33,810 You know, rejection. 505 00:33:42,920 --&gt;
00:33:46,356 BOBBY: <I>We ended up having</I> <I>to just kind of get
rid</I> <I>of all of our equipment,</I> 506 00:33:46,358 --&gt;
00:33:48,358 'cause we needed money at the time. 507 00:33:48,360 --&gt;
00:33:51,461 We gotta bail ourselves out of a number of things. 508
00:33:52,130 --&gt; 00:33:53,930 <I>And what happened was,</I> 509
00:33:53,932 --&gt; 00:33:56,433 <I>our distant relative,</I> <I>his
name was Donald Knight,</I> 510 00:33:56,435 --&gt; 00:33:59,436 <I>he
says, &quot;Well,</I> <I>you know, why don't you guy</I> <I>just come
up to New England</I> 511 00:33:59,438 --&gt; 00:34:01,738 <I>&quot;for
a couple of weeks,</I> <I>just clear your head?&quot;</I> 512
00:34:01,740 --&gt; 00:34:03,373 We didn't even know what he was
talking about. 513 00:34:03,375 --&gt; 00:34:05,008 We thought he was
talking about flying across the Atlantic. 514 00:34:05,010 --&gt;
00:34:07,210 We're like, &quot;New England? What'd you do with the
old one?&quot; 515 00:34:07,212 --&gt; 00:34:11,148 We took him up on
that offer, because basically there was nothing else 516 00:34:11,150
--&gt; 00:34:12,949 left to do in Detroit. 517 00:34:35,640 --&gt;
00:34:38,909 DANNIS: <I>So we came up here</I> <I>on a two-week
vacation,</I> 518 00:34:38,911 --&gt; 00:34:41,945 <I>and we just
never went back.</I> 519 00:34:44,549 --&gt; 00:34:46,016 <I>We found
apartments,</I> 520 00:34:46,018 --&gt; 00:34:49,086 <I>and then we
eventually</I> <I>bought even musical gear.</I> 521 00:34:51,722 --&gt;
00:34:53,690 DANNIS: <I>When we first</I> <I>got to Burlington,</I>
522 00:34:53,692 --&gt; 00:34:57,194 <I>David, he wanted to int-rod</I>
<I>the town to the band.</I> 523 00:34:58,896 --&gt; 00:35:00,864
Well, David went down the street. 524 00:35:00,866 --&gt;
00:35:02,232 On each pole, 525 00:35:03,401 --&gt; 00:35:05,001 he
put a Death poster. 526 00:35:05,003 --&gt; 00:35:08,605 So I think
he had about 500 of them printed up. 527 00:35:08,607 --&gt;
00:35:12,142 DANNIS: <I>I mean,</I> <I>the cops must've just went</I>
<I>by every pole he was at</I> 528 00:35:12,144 --&gt; 00:35:15,345
<I>and just grabbed them off,</I> <I>'cause when</I> <I>the cop came
to the door,</I> 529 00:35:15,347 --&gt; 00:35:18,915 he said, &quot;This
is a peaceful town, 530 00:35:18,917 --&gt; 00:35:21,485 &quot;and we
don't have gangs here.&quot; 531 00:35:21,487 --&gt; 00:35:24,054
<I>That's when I said,</I> <I>&quot;Dave, you better</I> <I>come to
the door, man.</I> 532 00:35:24,056 --&gt; 00:35:26,990 <I>&quot;They
think you're about</I> <I>to start a street gang.&quot;</I> 533
00:35:26,992 --&gt; 00:35:29,392 You know, he says, &quot;No, man,
this is a musical group. 534 00:35:29,394 --&gt; 00:35:31,328 &quot;This
is all about music.&quot; 535 00:35:31,330 --&gt; 00:35:34,898 He
says, &quot;Well, if you wanna get anywhere around here, you'll
change that name.&quot; 536 00:35:40,071 --&gt; 00:35:43,073 <I>You
know, after he left,</I> <I>I just closed the door</I> <I>and I said</I>
537 00:35:43,075 --&gt; 00:35:46,543 &quot;That's it, man. I'm just
tired of it.&quot; 538 00:35:46,545 --&gt; 00:35:50,814 <I>I'm tired
of the</I> <I>rejection, I'm tired</I> <I>of the snide comments.</I>
539 00:35:50,816 --&gt; 00:35:53,283 <I>I'm done with it.</I> 540
00:35:53,285 --&gt; 00:35:57,954 BOBBY: <I>We just understood</I>
<I>that we tried our best</I> <I>with Death.</I> 541 00:35:57,956 --&gt;
00:36:02,759 <I>We hung in thee</I> <I>from '73 to 19,</I> 542
00:36:02,761 --&gt; 00:36:06,096 dealing with rejection for our name,
rejection for our music, 543 00:36:06,098 --&gt; 00:36:08,999
rejection for the fact that we were black and playing rock 'n' roll,
544 00:36:09,001 --&gt; 00:36:11,368 rejection for the fact that our
music was too fast, 545 00:36:11,370 --&gt; 00:36:14,337 rejection
for... So many rejections. 546 00:36:14,339 --&gt; 00:36:19,409
DANNIS: <I>David, he felt</I> <I>the rejection as well as</I> <I>we
did. I mean, he knew.</I> 547 00:36:19,411 --&gt; 00:36:23,413 I
think it was David who came up with the name 4th Movement. 548
00:36:23,415 --&gt; 00:36:27,951 <I>We didn't even listen</I> <I>to
the concept or why</I> <I>he came up with the name.</I> 549
00:36:27,953 --&gt; 00:36:31,254 It wasn't Death, so me and Bob was
just like, &quot;Yeah, okay. 550 00:36:31,256 --&gt; 00:36:32,455
&quot;That's a good name.&quot; 551 00:36:32,457 --&gt; 00:36:36,793
(SONG PLAYING) 552 00:36:47,972 --&gt; 00:36:51,374 We just decided
to take our rock 'n' roll sound 553 00:36:51,376 --&gt; 00:36:53,109
and give it a spiritual concept. 554 00:36:53,111 --&gt; 00:36:57,714
(SONG PLAYING) 555 00:37:07,291 --&gt; 00:37:08,592 (LAUGHS) 556
00:37:27,478 --&gt; 00:37:31,281 DANNIS: <I>There was a campus</I>
<I>newspaper and the name</I> <I>of the article was,</I> 557
00:37:31,283 --&gt; 00:37:34,484 <I>&quot;Rock 'n' Roll,</I> <I>Hold
The Religion, Please.&quot;</I> 558 00:37:34,486 --&gt; 00:37:36,820
<I>And they were saying</I> <I>how good the music was,</I> 559
00:37:36,822 --&gt; 00:37:38,922 <I>but how they didn't</I> <I>like
the religious</I> 560 00:37:38,924 --&gt; 00:37:40,991 <I>aspects
that</I> <I>went along with it.</I> 561 00:37:45,129 --&gt;
00:37:47,964 BOBBY: <I>After all the rejection that</I> <I>we'd been
through with Death,</I> 562 00:37:47,966 --&gt; 00:37:50,567 there's
this big old article in <I>The Cynic</I> saying, 563 00:37:50,569 --&gt;
00:37:54,337 &quot;Nice music, hold the religion,&quot; with our
picture by it. 564 00:37:54,339 --&gt; 00:37:57,274 DANNIS: <I>Dave
took it</I> <I>really personally,</I> 565 00:37:57,276 --&gt;
00:38:00,744 <I>and I think</I> <I>he had just got fed up</I> <I>with
the rejection, too.</I> 566 00:38:00,746 --&gt; 00:38:04,347 That's
when the homesick for Detroit thing started to brewing up. 567
00:38:04,349 --&gt; 00:38:06,016 He wanted to go back to Detroit. 568
00:38:06,018 --&gt; 00:38:09,653 He really, literally, wanted to
bottle up everything 569 00:38:09,655 --&gt; 00:38:13,290 and take it
with him, including us. He wanted us to fold up. 570 00:38:13,292 --&gt;
00:38:16,726 But at the time, I mean, I had brought my wife, Tammy.
571 00:38:19,563 --&gt; 00:38:23,800 <I>And she had just</I> <I>had a
little baby,</I> <I>little Bobby.</I> 572 00:38:28,906 --&gt;
00:38:32,642 We just didn't wanna pack up and go back to Detroit, you
know? 573 00:38:33,611 --&gt; 00:38:36,646 So David went back to
Detroit. 574 00:38:46,857 --&gt; 00:38:52,696 Well, I am Heidi
Simpson, and David Hackney was my late husband. 575 00:38:53,331 --&gt;
00:38:54,664 Well, let me see. 576 00:38:54,666 --&gt; 00:38:57,167
Well, we moved from 577 00:38:58,302 --&gt; 00:39:01,404 Vermont to
Detroit in 1982. 578 00:39:03,607 --&gt; 00:39:05,642 <I>He wasn't
working at</I> <I>that time. I know that.</I> 579 00:39:05,644 --&gt;
00:39:12,515 He was staying at home and playing his music to himself
580 00:39:12,517 --&gt; 00:39:15,385 and trying to figure out what he
wanted to do himself. 581 00:39:15,387 --&gt; 00:39:18,421 <I>He just
wasn't no typical</I> <I>working person that, lik,</I> 582
00:39:18,423 --&gt; 00:39:20,323 <I>out there, doin</I> <I>the 9:00
to 5:.</I> 583 00:39:21,325 --&gt; 00:39:23,593 <I>And he was a
dreamer.</I> 584 00:39:23,595 --&gt; 00:39:25,628 (CLEARS THROAT) <I>He
liked, uh...</I> 585 00:39:27,365 --&gt; 00:39:29,999 <I>He would sit
out on the porcand just look in the...</I> 586 00:39:30,001 --&gt;
00:39:33,203 In the clouds in the sky 587 00:39:33,205 --&gt;
00:39:35,805 <I>and make pictures</I> <I>out of the cloud.</I> 588
00:39:42,179 --&gt; 00:39:45,148 (INDISTINCT) 589 00:39:45,150 --&gt;
00:39:49,819 BOBBY: <I>We went for</I> <I>about two or three yeas</I>
<I>without a guitar player</I> 590 00:39:49,821 --&gt; 00:39:53,123
Yeah, we would practice the same way every day that we always did.
591 00:39:57,528 --&gt; 00:40:01,965 DANNIS: <I>'Cause we</I> <I>was
always on the idea</I> <I>that David would come back.</I> 592
00:40:01,967 --&gt; 00:40:04,567 As time went on, we finally
realized, 593 00:40:04,569 --&gt; 00:40:08,571 &quot;Well, maybe
Dave's not coming back.&quot; 594 00:40:08,573 --&gt; 00:40:12,108 So
me and Bob stayed here and that's how Lambsbread was born. 595
00:40:12,643 --&gt; 00:40:14,310 (REGGAE PLAYING) 596 00:40:26,390
--&gt; 00:40:30,160 BOBBY: <I>We looked at</I> <I>each other and
said,</I> <I>&quot;Man, this is a no-brainer&quot;</I> 597
00:40:30,162 --&gt; 00:40:31,694 People love this music. 598
00:40:31,696 --&gt; 00:40:35,231 It's ruled by the bass and drums 599
00:40:35,233 --&gt; 00:40:37,634 and that's all we got right now. 600
00:40:38,969 --&gt; 00:40:42,305 So it was a no-brainer. That's how
we gravitated to reggae. 601 00:40:43,040 --&gt; 00:40:44,707 (REGGAE
PLAYING) 602 00:40:49,780 --&gt; 00:40:52,515 DANNIS: <I>We was able</I>
<I>to find ourselves</I> <I>a booking agent</I> 603 00:40:52,517 --&gt;
00:40:55,084 <I>and get on the road</I> <I>as Lambsbread.</I> <I>604

00:41:27,951 DANNIS: <I>And we was</I> <I>actually glad that we had</I>
<I>put down the name Death</I> 610 00:41:27,953 --&gt; 00:41:31,754
because we thought, okay, now that we got rid of that, you know, 611
00:41:31,756 --&gt; 00:41:34,390 things are beginning to open up for
us. 612 00:41:34,392 --&gt; 00:41:37,794 <I>Let them know it's t.</I>
<I>Come on!</I> 613 00:41:37,796 --&gt; 00:41:40,230 DANNIS: <I>That
might've rubbed</I> <I>David the wrong way,</I> 614 00:41:40,232 --&gt;
00:41:43,733 'cause at first he didn't really take to the news 615
00:41:43,735 --&gt; 00:41:46,636 that me and Bob was forming a reggae
band. 616 00:41:50,174 --&gt; 00:41:54,777 <I>It was like,</I> <I>&quot;Oh,
well, those cats done</I> <I>abandoned rock 'n' roll.&quot;</I> 617
00:41:54,779 --&gt; 00:41:57,413 No, man, we were sitting back
waiting for you to come, 618 00:41:57,415 --&gt; 00:42:01,651 but you
didn't come, so we had to busy ourselves with something. <I>619
00:42:01,653 --&gt; 00:42:04,087 BOBBY: I don't think he was
comfortable with the fact that 620 00:42:04,089 --&gt; 00:42:08,191
we traded in our rock 'n' roll for reggae.</I> 621 00:42:08,193 --&gt;
00:42:11,127 You know, in his eyes, we were still Death. 622
00:42:25,910 --&gt; 00:42:31,281 BOBBY JR.: <I>When I was young, my
father,</I> <I>he was a reggae musician.</I> 623 00:42:31,283 --&gt;
00:42:32,882 As a kid, that's all I knew... 624 00:42:32,884 --&gt;
00:42:34,918 I just knew them as reggae musicians. 625 00:42:34,920
--&gt; 00:42:37,020 And I just knew them as Lambsbread. 626
00:42:37,022 --&gt; 00:42:40,123 We did the same thing that our mom
and dad did for us. 627 00:42:40,125 --&gt; 00:42:42,559 <I>We just
made music</I> <I>available to the.</I> 628 00:42:42,561 --&gt;
00:42:46,663 My Uncle Dannis taught me all the basics of drumming,
629 00:42:46,665 --&gt; 00:42:48,197 which was really awesome. 630
00:42:48,199 --&gt; 00:42:50,500 DANNIS: <I>And I used to bring him</I>
<I>behind the drum set,</I> 631 00:42:50,502 --&gt; 00:42:53,336 and
I would put a stick in each of his hands 632 00:42:53,338 --&gt;
00:42:56,139 and kind of move his hands for him. 633 00:42:56,141 --&gt;
00:42:58,908 <I>And then when Bob</I> <I>had his other sons...</I>
634 00:43:02,546 --&gt; 00:43:06,382 When they saw how Bobby played
the drums, I guess, you know, 635 00:43:06,384 --&gt; 00:43:08,151
all of them wanted to play the drums. 636 00:43:08,153 --&gt;
00:43:11,854 Well, I was always, you know, influenced by my Uncle
Dannis and Bobby, 637 00:43:11,856 --&gt; 00:43:14,824 'cause, you
know, he always had drums laying around the room 638 00:43:14,826 --&gt;
00:43:16,659 <I>and I kind of</I> <I>caught on to that</I> 639
00:43:16,661 --&gt; 00:43:20,330 Yeah, my dad and uncle, they always
had a very strong, 640 00:43:20,332 --&gt; 00:43:22,298 serious
musical connection, 641 00:43:22,300 --&gt; 00:43:25,902 <I>and that
was</I> <I>something that made</I> <I>a profound impact on m.</I> 642
00:43:25,904 --&gt; 00:43:27,403 Bobby came to me one day and says,
643 00:43:27,405 --&gt; 00:43:30,940 &quot;Hey, man, you're turning
all of my sons into drummers.&quot; 644 00:43:30,942 --&gt;
00:43:32,709 (LAUGHS) You know? 645 00:43:37,181 --&gt; 00:43:42,285
My Uncle Dave, he was really my... One of my favorite uncles. 646
00:43:42,287 --&gt; 00:43:44,487 <I>And he was just</I> <I>always so
crazy</I> 647 00:43:44,489 --&gt; 00:43:47,323 <I>and so out there</I>
<I>and so out of the box.</I> 648 00:43:47,325 --&gt; 00:43:50,693
JULIAN: <I>He just had the best sense</I> <I>of humor and the best
laugh,</I> 649 00:43:50,695 --&gt; 00:43:52,528 <I>and I used to love</I>
<I>talking to him.</I> 650 00:43:52,530 --&gt; 00:43:56,699 You know?
'Cause he was just so lively and so funny, you know? 651 00:43:56,701
--&gt; 00:43:59,102 He was like a child. 652 00:43:59,104 --&gt;
00:44:04,440 BOBBY: <I>The thing that was</I> <I>kind of sad was I
never got</I> <I>to see him at his prime.</I> 653 00:44:04,442 --&gt;
00:44:07,543 I only... 'Cause he was... 654 00:44:07,545 --&gt;
00:44:11,080 He really got into the bottle, he really got into
alcohol. 655 00:44:11,082 --&gt; 00:44:15,551 So most of the time
that I saw him, he was always drunk. 656 00:44:15,553 --&gt;
00:44:17,420 BOBBY: <I>David thought...</I> 657 00:44:17,422 --&gt;
00:44:19,622 <I>He's one of</I> <I>these genius typ,</I> <I>man, you
know?</I> 658 00:44:19,624 --&gt; 00:44:23,426 I mean, the demons get
to you. You know what I mean? 659 00:44:23,428 --&gt; 00:44:25,895
The demons get to you. 660 00:44:25,897 --&gt; 00:44:29,132 EARL JR.:
<I>And David was gonna do</I> <I>what he was gonna do.</I> 661
00:44:31,235 --&gt; 00:44:33,903 And he was hell-bent on that. 662
00:44:33,905 --&gt; 00:44:37,006 <I>And nobody was</I> <I>gonna mess
with him.</I> 663 00:44:37,008 --&gt; 00:44:40,643 <I>And the more</I>
<I>that people tried to</I> 664 00:44:40,645 --&gt; 00:44:43,846
correct him, if you will, or change him, 665 00:44:44,815 --&gt;
00:44:48,718 the worse it became, okay? 666 00:44:48,720 --&gt;
00:44:50,853 He was a visionary. 667 00:44:50,855 --&gt; 00:44:52,789
He had a plan, 668 00:44:52,791 --&gt; 00:44:57,326 and that plan
didn't go through the way he wanted it to. 669 00:44:57,328 --&gt;
00:45:02,965 And I think part of his drinking then was from not being
able to 670 00:45:02,967 --&gt; 00:45:06,869 <I>fully express</I>
<I>what he wanted to do</I> <I>with his music and his art.</I> 671
00:45:09,339 --&gt; 00:45:13,009 This is part of the diary that David
had started, 672 00:45:13,011 --&gt; 00:45:15,311 and he's just
talking about, 673 00:45:16,680 --&gt; 00:45:20,349 uh, one day of
his life. 674 00:45:20,351 --&gt; 00:45:22,952 &quot;Check the dreams
that are in your mind. 675 00:45:22,954 --&gt; 00:45:26,155 &quot;Take
a flight to see which ones are really there. 676 00:45:26,157 --&gt;
00:45:29,959 &quot;Open up your eyes and see the paradise of a dream.
677 00:45:29,961 --&gt; 00:45:32,729 &quot;The world we know shall be
no more.&quot; 678 00:45:34,698 --&gt; 00:45:38,868 That was when
David revealed that 679 00:45:38,870 --&gt; 00:45:47,310 his music
would not come forth until after he had left this earth. 680
00:45:47,312 --&gt; 00:45:51,881 <I>I think he was just feelinlike he
wanted to leave back then.</I> 681 00:45:51,883 --&gt; 00:45:54,117
<I>He always was in</I> <I>another world, l,</I> 682 00:45:54,119 --&gt;
00:45:57,820 he just kept saying that he didn't wanna be here
anymore. 683 00:46:13,036 --&gt; 00:46:16,105 <I>Hendrix. Uh, no,</I>
<I>he was never an idol.</I> 684 00:46:16,107 --&gt; 00:46:18,474 <I>He
was like</I> <I>an influence to me.</I> 685 00:46:19,476 --&gt;
00:46:21,577 <I>I don't have any idols,</I> 686 00:46:21,579 --&gt;
00:46:23,446 <I>not on this earth.</I> 687 00:46:23,448 --&gt;
00:46:25,782 <I>My idol is Jesus Christ.</I> 688 00:46:25,784 --&gt;
00:46:28,985 <I>I follow him,</I> <I>until the day I die.</I> 689
00:46:28,987 --&gt; 00:46:34,457 <I>And then show me how to get p</I>
<I>to the orchestra, you know,</I> 690 00:46:34,459 --&gt;
00:46:37,059 <I>that's gonna play</I> <I>in front of the throne of
Go.</I> 691 00:46:37,061 --&gt; 00:46:38,995 <I>That's my
destination.</I> 692 00:46:40,030 --&gt; 00:46:41,631 <I>I wanna play</I>
693 00:46:42,399 --&gt; 00:46:44,467 <I>in front of the throne</I>
694 00:46:45,869 --&gt; 00:46:47,537 <I>of Almighty God.</I> 695
00:46:56,380 --&gt; 00:46:59,415 DANNIS: <I>And the last</I> <I>time
David was up here,</I> 696 00:46:59,417 --&gt; 00:47:01,851 the last
thing he did, he filmed my wedding. 697 00:47:04,021 --&gt;
00:47:05,855 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 698 00:47:07,991 --&gt;
00:47:10,993 DAVID: All right, we at the church, here. 699
00:47:10,995 --&gt; 00:47:13,029 And this is what it looks like
inside. 700 00:47:17,601 --&gt; 00:47:19,402 There go the groom. 701
00:47:20,304 --&gt; 00:47:22,271 (WEDDING MARCH PLAYING) 702
00:47:22,840 --&gt; 00:47:25,208 There go the bride 703 00:47:26,476
--&gt; 00:47:27,944 and her dad. 704 00:47:31,381 --&gt; 00:47:32,748
(DAVID LAUGHS) 705 00:47:32,750 --&gt; 00:47:34,350 Look at Dannis.
706 00:47:35,719 --&gt; 00:47:37,687 DANNIS: <I>I had</I> <I>a
conversation</I> <I>with my mother.</I> 707 00:47:37,689 --&gt;
00:47:40,456 <I>She said, &quot;You know what</I> <I>your brother
David told me&quot;</I> 708 00:47:40,458 --&gt; 00:47:41,791 I said,
&quot;No, what'd he tell you?&quot; 709 00:47:41,793 --&gt;
00:47:43,993 &quot;He said, 'When you get home, 710 00:47:45,729 --&gt;
00:47:48,497 &quot;'get ready to bury one of your sons.'&quot; 711
00:47:49,366 --&gt; 00:47:51,234 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 712
00:47:57,407 --&gt; 00:48:00,943 And we noticed that he was frail 713
00:48:00,945 --&gt; 00:48:03,079 and that he didn't look that good.
714 00:48:03,081 --&gt; 00:48:05,181 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 715
00:48:05,183 --&gt; 00:48:06,749 Hey, man. Hey, man. 716 00:48:06,751
--&gt; 00:48:09,485 (LAUGHS) 717 00:48:09,487 --&gt; 00:48:11,654
BOBBY: <I>And we asked him,</I> <I>you know,</I> <I>&quot;Is
everything okay?&quot;</I> 718 00:48:11,656 --&gt; 00:48:13,756 And
he never said nothing to anybody. He... 719 00:48:13,758 --&gt;
00:48:16,459 &quot;Yeah, everything's okay. Everything's... I'm all
right. I'm all right.&quot; 720 00:48:16,461 --&gt; 00:48:17,760
(MUSIC PLAYING) 721 00:48:17,762 --&gt; 00:48:20,830 <I>I just wanted
to</I> <I>say these words,</I> 722 00:48:20,832 --&gt; 00:48:23,799
<I>'cause me and my brothe</I> <I>Dannis have been throug</I> <I>heaven
together,</I> 723 00:48:23,801 --&gt; 00:48:25,334 <I>we've been
throug</I> <I>hell together,</I> 724 00:48:25,336 --&gt; 00:48:28,971
<I>we've been down in the ditc we've been on the heights.</I> 725
00:48:28,973 --&gt; 00:48:31,407 <I>We've got a great</I> <I>career
as musician726 00:48:31,409 --&gt; 00:48:36,045 and we're
well-respected here in the community and we thank God for that.</I>
727 00:48:36,047 --&gt; 00:48:39,115 DANNIS: <I>But before</I> <I>Dave
left my weddi,</I> 728 00:48:39,117 --&gt; 00:48:42,151 <I>he brought
all the Death mas tapes 729 00:48:42,153 --&gt; 00:48:43,686 and told
Bob to hold them.</I> 730 00:48:43,688 --&gt; 00:48:47,290 He says,
&quot;One day the world's gonna come looking for this, 731
00:48:47,292 --&gt; 00:48:49,492 &quot;and I know that you will keep
them.&quot; 732 00:48:53,096 --&gt; 00:48:54,297 (INAUDIBLE) 733
00:48:57,000 --&gt; 00:48:58,734 BOBBY: <I>And I say, &quot;Dave,</I>
<I>I have enough tapes.</I> 734 00:48:58,736 --&gt; 00:49:00,136 <I>&quot;I
got enough of</I> <I>our stuff, man.&quot;</I> 735 00:49:00,138 --&gt;
00:49:02,571 <I>He says, &quot;No.&quot; He says,</I> <I>&quot;You
gotta keep these.&quot;</I> 736 00:49:02,573 --&gt; 00:49:04,707 He
says, &quot;The world's gonna come looking for the Death stuff.&quot;
737 00:49:04,709 --&gt; 00:49:06,175 And he says, &quot;I know that
you'll have it 738 00:49:06,177 --&gt; 00:49:07,576 &quot;when they
come looking for it.&quot; 739 00:49:13,750 --&gt; 00:49:18,254 That
was when he told us, he says, &quot;Man, when y'all make it with this
music,&quot; 740 00:49:18,256 --&gt; 00:49:20,790 he says, &quot;I'm
not gonna be with you guys.&quot; 741 00:49:27,164 --&gt;
00:49:29,632 DANNIS: <I>When I hugged</I> <I>David before he lef 742
00:49:29,634 --&gt; 00:49:33,002 David let me know that I wasn't
gonna see him again.</I> 743 00:49:47,017 --&gt; 00:49:50,619 BOBBY:
<I>And then</I> <I>after he got back ho,</I> <I>a few months later,</I>
744 00:49:50,621 --&gt; 00:49:53,089 <I>we got a call fro</I> <I>our
brother Earl.</I> 745 00:49:55,225 --&gt; 00:49:58,294 You know, Earl
said to me... 746 00:50:01,498 --&gt; 00:50:03,599 He said, &quot;He's
dying, Bob.&quot; 747 00:50:05,168 --&gt; 00:50:06,535 (SOBBING) 748
00:50:10,741 --&gt; 00:50:13,943 I remember that so well, like it was
yesterday. 749 00:50:15,412 --&gt; 00:50:16,746 I mean... 750
00:50:19,249 --&gt; 00:50:22,551 &quot;What do you mean David's
dying?&quot; 751 00:50:22,553 --&gt; 00:50:27,456 David had a pretty
advanced cigarette habit 752 00:50:27,458 --&gt; 00:50:32,795 <I>that
eventually ended up</I> <I>taking a toll on his life.</I> 753
00:50:32,797 --&gt; 00:50:37,767 He says, &quot;Yeah, Bob,&quot; he
says, &quot;he's got full-blown lung cancer.&quot; 754 00:50:37,769
--&gt; 00:50:39,835 And that just floored me. 755 00:50:40,971 --&gt;
00:50:44,273 Once he hit intensive care, man, it was... 756
00:50:44,275 --&gt; 00:50:45,608 (EXHALES) 757 00:50:47,210 --&gt;
00:50:48,878 It was all over. 758 00:50:52,182 --&gt; 00:50:53,616
David died, 759 00:50:54,951 --&gt; 00:50:56,619 uh, 760 00:50:56,621
--&gt; 00:50:58,888 day after my wife's birthday. 761 00:51:00,524
--&gt; 00:51:02,591 Tammy's birthday is on the 8th of October, 762
00:51:02,593 --&gt; 00:51:05,327 and I think David died on the 9th.
763 00:51:13,804 --&gt; 00:51:16,839 <I>I just put the ts</I> <I>in a
safe place.</I> 764 00:51:18,375 --&gt; 00:51:20,443 <I>I didn't
think about them.</I> 765 00:51:22,212 --&gt; 00:51:24,747 I was
thinking too much about David. 766 00:51:32,089 --&gt; 00:51:35,958
DANNIS: <I>When I eventually went</I> <I>to David's funeral in
Detroi,</I> 767 00:51:36,626 --&gt; 00:51:38,360 <I>I thought that,</I>
768 00:51:38,362 --&gt; 00:51:42,064 <I>&quot;I guess the Death thing</I>
<I>is just gone with Dave.&quot;</I> 769 00:51:50,073 --&gt;
00:51:54,743 EARL JR.: <I>David's dream</I> <I>and the thing that he
always</I> <I>said was consistent</I> 770 00:51:54,745 --&gt;
00:51:56,145 <I>from day one.</I> 771 00:51:56,147 --&gt;
00:52:00,549 And he never wavered in the story, nor his dream. 772
00:52:00,551 --&gt; 00:52:03,886 <I>And so, yes, he did</I> <I>carry
that all the way</I> <I>up till the end.</I> 773 00:52:03,888 --&gt;
00:52:08,157 My wife used to say that Dave was Dave when he was
playing his guitar. 774 00:52:11,795 --&gt; 00:52:17,266 <I>If you
wanted to see the real</I> <I>Dave, you gotta catch him</I> <I>playing
his guitar.</I> 775 00:52:17,268 --&gt; 00:52:20,169 BOBBY: <I>You
know,</I> <I>David continued to</I> <I>write beautiful music,</I> 776
00:52:20,171 --&gt; 00:52:22,471 <I>right on up</I> <I>until he die.</I>
777 00:52:25,976 --&gt; 00:52:27,576 This right here 778 00:52:28,178
--&gt; 00:52:30,212 is, um, 779 00:52:30,214 --&gt; 00:52:32,915 the
last record that David made 780 00:52:33,683 --&gt; 00:52:35,684
before he died. 781 00:52:35,686 --&gt; 00:52:39,755 And, as you can
see, his nickname was Rough Francis. 782 00:52:39,757 --&gt;
00:52:43,058 You know, the name of the song is <I>I'd Be Your Doggie.</I>
783 00:52:43,060 --&gt; 00:52:46,462 And then it was backed by a song
called 784 00:52:46,464 --&gt; 00:52:48,330 <I>We're Gonna Make I.</I>
785 00:52:52,269 --&gt; 00:52:55,738 And you know who plays on this?
David did recruit, 786 00:52:55,740 --&gt; 00:52:59,275 uh, myself
and Dannis to help him 787 00:52:59,277 --&gt; 00:53:01,844 on the
tracks on this. 788 00:53:01,846 --&gt; 00:53:04,713 So, you know,
this is kind of like 789 00:53:05,882 --&gt; 00:53:09,518 the last
time that we really got together 790 00:53:09,520 --&gt; 00:53:11,387
and made a recording. 791 00:53:12,255 --&gt; 00:53:17,326 (SINGING)
792 00:53:28,972 --&gt; 00:53:34,109 &quot;Now the way that it's
been, we've seen thick and thin, and dark days all around us.&quot;
793 00:53:34,111 --&gt; 00:53:35,311 Um... 794 00:53:36,646 --&gt;
00:53:40,015 &quot;But now that it's over, let our love grow
stronger. 795 00:53:41,418 --&gt; 00:53:43,485 &quot;Don't you cry
now, 796 00:53:44,287 --&gt; 00:53:45,988 &quot;we're gonna make it.
797 00:53:45,990 --&gt; 00:53:48,791 &quot;Don't you cry now, we're
gonna make it.&quot; 798 00:53:48,793 --&gt; 00:53:51,327 I think
that says it all. 799 00:53:51,329 --&gt; 00:53:54,663 We stuck
together through thick and thin for 22 years. 800 00:53:56,032 --&gt;
00:53:57,700 (SOBBING) 801 00:53:57,702 --&gt; 00:54:00,803 (SONG
PLAYING) 802 00:54:30,734 --&gt; 00:54:32,134 (CABLE CAR RUMBLING)
803 00:54:36,806 --&gt; 00:54:41,243 Talk about record collecting, he
says. Well, you go by hunches. 804 00:54:41,245 --&gt; 00:54:43,145 I
mean, I found this in a thrift store. 805 00:54:43,147 --&gt;
00:54:46,115 Glenn Schwartz and the All Saved Freak Band, 806
00:54:46,117 --&gt; 00:54:47,983 with a brain on the cover. 807
00:54:47,985 --&gt; 00:54:50,452 I thought, &quot;How can I not take
this home?&quot; 808 00:54:50,454 --&gt; 00:54:54,757 And here's my
favorite Christian ventriloquist, 809 00:54:54,759 --&gt;
00:54:56,925 Marcy and Little Marcy. 810 00:54:56,927 --&gt;
00:55:00,329 Don Bolles, formerly of the Germs, actually tracked her
down 811 00:55:00,331 --&gt; 00:55:02,831 and got one of the dolls a
while back. 812 00:55:02,833 --&gt; 00:55:06,502 Robbie The Werewolf
is sort of self-explanatory. 813 00:55:06,504 --&gt; 00:55:09,338
This is a regular old lounge guy, but... 814 00:55:09,839 --&gt;
00:55:12,574 (LAUGHS) 815 00:55:12,576 --&gt; 00:55:15,344 Somebody
to haunt you in your dreams. 816 00:55:15,346 --&gt; 00:55:19,948
Anyway, so when I saw the Death record, the single, 817 00:55:19,950
--&gt; 00:55:23,152 <I>Politicians In My Eyes,</I> <I>pop up on this
one guy's list,</I> 818 00:55:23,154 --&gt; 00:55:24,720 buried in
everything else. 819 00:55:24,722 --&gt; 00:55:26,889 The &quot;Northern
Soul,&quot; as they call it, 820 00:55:26,891 --&gt; 00:55:28,123 for
ridiculous amounts of money. 821 00:55:28,125 --&gt; 00:55:29,325 And
there was this little record, 822 00:55:29,327 --&gt; 00:55:31,193
<I>Politicians In My Eyes,</I> <I>and I thought,</I> 823 00:55:31,195
--&gt; 00:55:33,462 &quot;This looks interesting.&quot; 824
00:55:38,068 --&gt; 00:55:40,669 I was interviewing Jello Biafra 825
00:55:40,671 --&gt; 00:55:43,138 for a book that some friends of mine
were writing 826 00:55:43,140 --&gt; 00:55:45,974 about the history
of band T-shirts. 827 00:55:45,976 --&gt; 00:55:49,011 I know that
Jello's a really huge punk collector. 828 00:55:49,013 --&gt;
00:55:51,213 And this collector friend of mine said, 829 00:55:51,215
--&gt; 00:55:53,949 &quot;Jello supposedly has a box of the Death
single.&quot; 830 00:55:56,252 --&gt; 00:55:57,886 <I>And I said,</I>
<I>&quot;What's the Death single?&quot;</I> 831 00:55:57,888 --&gt;
00:56:01,023 He's like, &quot;Oh, man, it's this all-black punk band
from Detroit 832 00:56:01,025 --&gt; 00:56:02,858 &quot;and it's
super hard to find.&quot; 833 00:56:06,963 --&gt; 00:56:12,134 Das
was a guy that I'd seen coming into the record store often. 834
00:56:12,136 --&gt; 00:56:14,036 He never talked. He was always very
quiet. 835 00:56:14,038 --&gt; 00:56:15,604 But he would buy really
cool records. 836 00:56:15,606 --&gt; 00:56:18,207 &quot;I got a
record you might be interested in. I'll just give you a copy. 837
00:56:18,209 --&gt; 00:56:21,977 &quot;It's friends of mine that I
knew back when I was... 838 00:56:21,979 --&gt; 00:56:23,979 &quot;You
know, just got out of college.&quot; 839 00:56:23,981 --&gt;
00:56:26,648 So I gave him a brand-new copy of the Death record and
he just like, 840 00:56:26,650 --&gt; 00:56:28,016 &quot;Where'd you
get that?&quot; 841 00:56:28,018 --&gt; 00:56:31,720 He says, &quot;Hey,
you know, my friends gave me these 45s, 842 00:56:31,722 --&gt;
00:56:34,323 &quot;and, uh, they told me to give them out to help
promote their band, 843 00:56:34,325 --&gt; 00:56:36,358 &quot;and I
never really got them out there. 844 00:56:36,360 --&gt; 00:56:38,093
&quot;But, you know, it's never too late. 845 00:56:38,095 --&gt;
00:56:40,496 &quot;So, you know, if you could take these home and
give these a listen... 846 00:56:40,498 --&gt; 00:56:41,997 &quot;These
guys were friends of mine.&quot; 847 00:56:43,633 --&gt; 00:56:48,036
BOBBY: <I>Don Schwenk,</I> <I>we met in 19,</I> 848 00:56:48,038 --&gt;
00:56:52,141 <I>when we were</I> <I>releasing those Death 45.</I> 849
00:56:52,143 --&gt; 00:56:56,278 And David had commissioned Don to do
the artwork. 850 00:56:56,280 --&gt; 00:56:59,748 And he wanted a
triangle in the clouds. 851 00:56:59,750 --&gt; 00:57:01,683 But, you
know, of course, they never had the money 852 00:57:01,685 --&gt;
00:57:03,185 to follow through on any of the stuff, 853 00:57:03,187
--&gt; 00:57:05,554 so, basically, I did all this artwork for them,
854 00:57:05,556 --&gt; 00:57:08,490 but they couldn't pay me, so
they traded me records. 855 00:57:08,492 --&gt; 00:57:09,691 That's
what happened. 856 00:57:11,528 --&gt; 00:57:16,298 So now I got
these clean copies of the Death 45 from Das. 857 00:57:18,001 --&gt;
00:57:21,503 <I>I left one on the</I> <I>counter here, and</I> <I>Ben
Blackwell took that.</I> 858 00:57:22,572 --&gt; 00:57:25,674 So this
7-inch, it's a limited press, 859 00:57:25,676 --&gt; 00:57:28,844
it's Detroit, it's punk rock, it's hard to find 860 00:57:28,846 --&gt;
00:57:30,345 and not a lot of people know about it. 861 00:57:30,347
--&gt; 00:57:32,548 I mean, this hits all of my checklist, 862
00:57:32,550 --&gt; 00:57:34,483 you know, this is something meant
for me. 863 00:57:34,485 --&gt; 00:57:35,784 So there it is, 864
00:57:35,786 --&gt; 00:57:37,886 <I>Politicians In My Eyes,</I> <I>which
is the A-side,</I> 865 00:57:37,888 --&gt; 00:57:41,023 and, uh, <I>Keep
On Knocking,</I> <I>which is the B-side.</I> 866 00:57:42,725 --&gt;
00:57:45,594 Later that night, another record collector 867
00:57:46,596 --&gt; 00:57:49,031 told me the value of the record. 868
