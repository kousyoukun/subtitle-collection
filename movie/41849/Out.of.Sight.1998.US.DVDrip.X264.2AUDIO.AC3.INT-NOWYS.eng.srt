1
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:30,214
- You have a loan app? Wonderful. - Yeah. Terrific.

2
00:01:38,763 --> 00:01:44,059
My wife and l were having dinner the other night-- recently married.

3
00:01:51,775 --> 00:01:54,444
- How can l help you, sir? - Loretta,

4
00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:59,239
see the man talking to your bank manager has his case open?

5
00:01:59,323 --> 00:02:01,866
Oh, that's Mr. Gwendon, one of our assistant managers.

6
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:04,035
Our manager is Mr. Schoen, but he's not in today.

7
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:06,997
-But you see the man with the briefcase. -Yes.

8
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,373
That's my partner. He has a gun in there.

9
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:13,044
lf you don't do exactly what l tell you or if you give me any kind of problem at all,

10
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:17,089
l'm going to look at my partner and he's going to shoot your Mr. Gwendon between the eyes.

11
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,470
Okay.

12
00:02:23,554 --> 00:02:29,100
All right, take one of those big envelopes and put as many 100s, 50s and 20s as you can into it.

13
00:02:29,142 --> 00:02:33,562
Nothing with bank straps or rubber bands. l don't want dye packs. l don't want bait money.

14
00:02:33,604 --> 00:02:37,148
Start with the second drawer, and then the one over there, under the money counter.

15
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,530
Okay. lt's okay. Come on, Loretta. Key's right next to you.

16
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:46,532
There you go.

17
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:54,748
No bills off the bottom of the drawer, please.

18
00:03:01,296 --> 00:03:03,798
This your first time being robbed?

19
00:03:03,882 --> 00:03:07,802
You're doing great. Just smile so you don't look like you're being held up.

20
00:03:09,303 --> 00:03:11,596
You got a very pretty smile.

21
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:14,141
You got 20s? Give me the 20s. l'll take those.

22
00:03:14,183 --> 00:03:16,143
There you go. l'll put those in my pocket.

23
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,228
There you go.

24
00:03:21,147 --> 00:03:23,816
l have to give my partner a sign. Now, that's good.

25
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,695
He's gonna wait until l'm out of the building, make sure you haven't set off the alarm.

26
00:03:27,778 --> 00:03:32,156
lf you have, he's gonna shoot your Mr. Gwendon between the eyes. Okay?

27
00:03:32,241 --> 00:03:35,994
- Okay. - l think that'll do it, Loretta.

28
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:38,663
Thank you. Have a nice day.

29
00:03:38,747 --> 00:03:40,999
You too.

30
00:03:46,128 --> 00:03:50,173
Hey-- she's cute, isn't she?

31
00:03:50,257 --> 00:03:52,175
Yeah, she seems very nice.

32
00:03:54,427 --> 00:03:56,345
Who was that?

33
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,293
No, no, no, no, no.

34
00:04:31,377 --> 00:04:35,213
Son of a bitch!

35
00:04:35,256 --> 00:04:38,050
Fuck! Fuck!

36
00:04:38,134 --> 00:04:42,221
l think you flooded it. Get out of the car, sir.

37
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:46,390
- Hey, you wanna hear a funny story? - Shut up and get out of the car!

38
00:04:46,474 --> 00:04:50,602
Yeah. Okay.

39
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:19,086
Go, go, go!

40
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:26,898
You want somethin', Foley?

41
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:30,818
Some fellas are goin' out of here. What if l tell you where and when?

42
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,196
- How many? - Expect you to look out for me, let me run off work detail--

43
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,657
Okay, okay. How many goin' out?

44
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:38,742
- l hear six. - When?

45
00:06:38,826 --> 00:06:41,995
- Tonight. - You know who they are?

46
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,831
Yes, l do. But l'm not gonna tell you just yet.

47
00:06:44,915 --> 00:06:48,001
Meet me in the chapel, just before lockdown. Okay?

48
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:57,801
- You all right? - l love you, baby.

49
00:06:57,843 --> 00:07:00,678
Tonight's the big night. You excited?

50
00:07:02,431 --> 00:07:06,559
- lt's Super Bowl Sunday, okay? - See you moved it up.

51
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:09,729
- Why you think that? - l saw you runnin' this mornin'.

52
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:12,314
Stickin' to your routine in case anybody happened to notice.

53
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:15,859
But you only did a couple of miles, instead of your usual five.

54
00:07:15,943 --> 00:07:20,071
Saving yourself for the big event. What happened? Finish ahead of schedule?

55
00:07:20,155 --> 00:07:22,990
Mira, you see those posts out there?

56
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:27,870
They're putting up another fence 15 feet back the fence that's already there, you know?

57
00:07:27,912 --> 00:07:31,331
So you figure, mira, we wait till Super Bowl Sunday, they have that fence built...

58
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:34,500
then, cono, we gotta dig what, another nine, ten days, baby?

59
00:07:34,543 --> 00:07:36,503
- Yeah. - l don't think so.

60
00:07:36,545 --> 00:07:42,133
So tonight, when it gets dark, batta-bing, l'm outta here. Come on, Foley. You could come.

61
00:07:42,217 --> 00:07:45,845
l appreciate the offer, and it's tempting.

62
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:48,722
lt's a long run to civilization. What's it? A hundred miles to Miami?

63
00:07:48,764 --> 00:07:52,142
l'm too old to be tryin' a stunt like that.

64
00:07:52,226 --> 00:07:54,811
So, you send me a postcard when you get out.

65
00:08:07,406 --> 00:08:11,951
- Adele Delisi speaking. - Will you accept a collect call from Jack Foley?

66
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:15,038
Yeah, l'll accept.

67
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,124
- Hey, Adele, how you doin'? - Hey, bank robber.

68
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:22,794
Want some advice? Next time, keep the engine running.

69
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:26,297
- Huh-huh. That's funny! - What do you want, Jack?

70
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:31,719
Adele, you know that Super Bowl party that was for next Sunday?

71
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,555
They changed the date. lt's tonight at 6:30.

72
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:39,267
- Didn't you tell me one time calls aren't monitored? - l said, not as a rule.

73
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,979
So why don't you just come right out and tell me what you're talkin' about?

74
00:08:42,062 --> 00:08:45,773
- Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth, out there in the free world. - Oh, yeah, what's free about it?

75
00:08:45,857 --> 00:08:47,942
l'm lookin' for work.

76
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:52,905
- What about Mandrake the Magician? - Emil, The Amazing, huh?

77
00:08:52,947 --> 00:08:57,034
He fired me. Hired a younger girl-- a redhead.

78
00:08:57,118 --> 00:09:00,287
Adele, the reason l'm calling-- they changed the date.

79
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:03,957
lt is tonight. lt's 6:30. That's like a few hours from now.

80
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,668
- You tell Buddy-- - Okay, all right, and the guy driving the other car?

81
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:11,004
- What are you talking about? - Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars,

82
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:13,799
Buddy thought it might be better to bring two, you know?

83
00:09:13,883 --> 00:09:16,051
He got this guy who says you know him, from Lompoc--

84
00:09:16,135 --> 00:09:18,845
- Uh, Glenn somebody-- - Glenn Michaels.

85
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:22,807
Uh-huh, that's him. Buddy said Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.

86
00:09:22,849 --> 00:09:24,809
- Adele? - Yeah?

87
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:29,188
You tell Buddy l see Glenn wearing his sunglasses, l'm gonna step on 'em.

88
00:09:29,272 --> 00:09:32,441
- Might not even take 'em off first. - Okay, honey. l'll do that.

89
00:09:32,483 --> 00:09:34,651
Now, you try not to get shot. Bye.

90
00:09:34,818 --> 00:09:36,778
Hey--

91
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,050
Here, ma'am. Let me help you with these.

92
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:03,219
Beautiful young lady like you shouldn't be carrying groceries.

93
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:06,137
Let a man do that for you.

94
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:12,393
Now, l didn't ask for your help, so don't expect a tip.

95
00:10:12,477 --> 00:10:17,314
Oh, that's okay, ma'am. l'll just take your car.

96
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:19,692
Happy birthday.

97
00:10:19,734 --> 00:10:22,027
Did you fit another Chanel suit in here?

98
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:24,363
Something much better. Go ahead, open it.

99
00:10:31,912 --> 00:10:35,206
Oh, my God. lt's beautiful.

100
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:38,042
- lt's a, um-- - Sig Sauer 380.

101
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:43,005
- Right. - Oh, l love it!

102
00:10:43,047 --> 00:10:45,007
Thanks, Dad.

103
00:10:45,048 --> 00:10:47,216
Happy birthday.

104
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:49,219
- How 'bout some more coffee? - You know, l can't.

105
00:10:49,302 --> 00:10:53,889
l have to go out to Glades, and then l'm meeting Ray Nicolet at 10:00.

106
00:10:53,973 --> 00:10:56,558
Which one is that? The A.T.F. guy?

107
00:10:56,642 --> 00:11:00,228
Actually, he's with the F.B.l. now. He switched over.

108
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:04,608
- He's still married, though. - Technically. They're separated.

109
00:11:04,691 --> 00:11:07,109
- Well, so he's moved out then. - He's about to.

110
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:11,238
- Well, then they're not separated, are they? - Can we not talk about this?

111
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:17,036
- What are you doing at Glades? - Serving process-- a summons and complaint.

112
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:20,079
Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese.

113
00:11:20,164 --> 00:11:24,918
So, he files suit. Says he doesn't have any choice in what they serve,

114
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,420
and that violates his civil rights.

115
00:11:27,462 --> 00:11:32,758
- You can step in, work full-time as one of my investigators. - No, thanks.

116
00:11:32,842 --> 00:11:35,135
- You used to like it. - Dad.

117
00:11:35,219 --> 00:11:39,931
You'd meet doctors, lawyers-- nothing wrong with them, if they're divorced.

118
00:11:39,973 --> 00:11:44,685
Karen, why waste your time on some cowboy cop...

119
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:46,729
who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?

120
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:49,398
That's how those hot shots are-- all of 'em!

121
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,400
l really gotta go.

122
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,948
We don't talk much anymore.

123
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:04,495
How 'bout l come over Sunday and we watch the Super Bowl together?

124
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:06,539
l'd like that.

125
00:12:07,623 --> 00:12:09,457
Thanks for the gun, Dad.

126
00:12:24,138 --> 00:12:26,723
They're right underneath you, Pup. They dug a tunnel.

127
00:12:26,807 --> 00:12:32,437
l don't hear anything. Where's the tunnel come out?

128
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:35,314
Fourth post from the guard tower.

129
00:12:35,398 --> 00:12:37,608
l don't see nothin'.

130
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,610
You just keep watchin'.

131
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,466
Federal Bureau of lnvestigation, how may l direct your call?

132
00:13:04,508 --> 00:13:07,051
Yeah, this is Karen Sisco again for Ray Nicolet.

133
00:13:07,135 --> 00:13:09,220
Hold, please.

134
00:13:09,304 --> 00:13:11,222
Yeah.

135
00:13:31,782 --> 00:13:34,325
The line is busy. Would you like his voice mail?

136
00:13:34,368 --> 00:13:37,662
No, forget it. l'll call back later.

137
00:13:37,705 --> 00:13:39,665
- All right. - Thanks.

138
00:13:40,957 --> 00:13:42,875
Still don't see anything.

139
00:13:45,086 --> 00:13:47,671
You will directly.

140
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:52,592
Wait a minute.

141
00:14:13,195 --> 00:14:15,071
What the fuck?

142
00:14:29,877 --> 00:14:31,711
Two men by the fence!

143
00:14:49,311 --> 00:14:51,646
What the hell is she doin'?

144
00:15:00,696 --> 00:15:03,281
Stop! Get your hands in the air!

145
00:15:20,381 --> 00:15:24,468
Tunnel's clear. Seal up the north face.

146
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:28,012
- What happened? - What the hell do you think, jackass? Got a jail break!

147
00:15:28,096 --> 00:15:31,765
Cubans out in the cane. Don't point that thing at me. Hey, Buddy.

148
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:35,978
- lt's okay, we're the good guys. - What are you doing here?

149
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:39,981
All right. You're just a girl. What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?

150
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:44,860
- l'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest. - That's probably all the hacks.

151
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,321
Why don't we talk about this later?

152
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,866
Watch your head.

153
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,618
l'm in. Let's go!

154
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:58,331
- Hey! You comfy? - lf l could have a little more room--

155
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,333
Well, there isn't any.

156
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,461
We got a lot of shit in here. We got handcuffs in here.

157
00:16:03,503 --> 00:16:06,130
What's in this can?

158
00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:09,133
That's for your breath. You could use it-- squirt some in your mouth.

159
00:16:09,175 --> 00:16:11,176
Yeah, well, that's mace, isn't it?

160
00:16:17,891 --> 00:16:20,935
All right, you! Get--

161
00:16:23,021 --> 00:16:26,857
Hey. Where's your gun-- pistol?

162
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:29,985
ln my bag, in the car.

163
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,330
Boy, it stunk in there.

164
00:16:42,371 --> 00:16:46,166
l believe it. You're ruining a $900 suit my dad gave me.

165
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,793
Yeah, it went great with that 12-gauge too.

166
00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:51,129
Why in the world would someone like you become a federal marshal?

167
00:16:51,213 --> 00:16:54,215
- The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me. - Sorry, what was that?

168
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:56,425
Guys like me? Let me tell you something.

169
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:59,720
Even though l've been celibate lately, l'm not going to force myself on you.

170
00:16:59,804 --> 00:17:02,431
- l've never done that in my life. - You wouldn't have time, anyway.

171
00:17:02,515 --> 00:17:05,893
We come to a roadblock, they run the car and find out who it belongs to.

172
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:09,270
That's if they get set up in time, which l doubt. lf they do,

173
00:17:09,354 --> 00:17:13,357
they'll be lookin' for a bunch of little Latin fellas, not a big black guy drivin' a Ford.

174
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,568
He must be quite a pal, to risk his own ass like this.

175
00:17:16,611 --> 00:17:18,654
Buddy? Yeah, he's a good guy.

176
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:23,951
Back when we jailed together, he used to call his sister every week, without fail.

177
00:17:24,034 --> 00:17:27,745
She's a born-again Christian. She does bookkeeping for a televangelist.

178
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,747
He'd call her up, confess his sins.

179
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:32,083
He'd tell her whatever bank he happened to rob at the time.

180
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,251
Buddy-- that his given name?

181
00:17:34,335 --> 00:17:36,753
The one l gave him, yeah.

182
00:17:36,837 --> 00:17:40,089
So, what's your name?

183
00:17:40,174 --> 00:17:42,592
Be in the paper tomorrow, anyway.

184
00:17:42,634 --> 00:17:45,886
Jack Foley. You've probably heard of me.

185
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:49,181
-Why? Are you famous? -The time l was convicted in California,

186
00:17:49,265 --> 00:17:54,186
the F.B.l. told me that l'd robbed more banks than anybody in the computer.

187
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,939
- How many was that? - Tell you the truth, l don't really know.

188
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:02,401
Started when l was 18 years old, driving for my Uncle Cully, and his partner, Gus.

189
00:18:02,444 --> 00:18:07,073
So, basically you're saying you spent half your life in prison.

190
00:18:07,115 --> 00:18:09,784
Basically, yeah. l go back, l do 30 years. No time off.

191
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:14,913
- You imagine lookin' at that? - l don't have to. l don't rob banks.

192
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,459
You don't seem all that scared.

193
00:18:19,543 --> 00:18:23,296
- Of course l am. - You don't act like it.

194
00:18:23,338 --> 00:18:25,298
What do you want me to do, scream?

195
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:27,465
That wouldn't help much, anyway.

196
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:33,179
No, l'm just gonna sit here, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.

197
00:18:33,263 --> 00:18:35,640
You sound like my ex-wife.

198
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:40,144
- You were married? - Just for about a year, give or take a few days.

199
00:18:40,228 --> 00:18:43,105
lt's not like we didn't get along-- we had fun. We just...

200
00:18:43,147 --> 00:18:46,775
didn't have... that thing, you know, that uh--

201
00:18:46,817 --> 00:18:51,613
- That spark, you know? Gotta have that. - Mm-hmm.

202
00:18:51,655 --> 00:18:53,990
- We still talk, though. - Sure.

203
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:59,495
This is not gonna end well. These things never do.

204
00:18:59,537 --> 00:19:02,331
lf it turns out l get shot like a dog, it's gonna be in the street,

205
00:19:02,415 --> 00:19:04,500
not off a goddamn fence.

206
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:08,211
You must really see yourself as some kind of Clyde Barrow, huh?

207
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,676
- You mean, of Bonnie and Clyde? - Yeah.

208
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:23,141
The part in the movie where they get shot, when it's Warren Beatty and--

209
00:19:23,183 --> 00:19:25,726
- Faye Dunaway. - Faye Dunaway, yeah.

210
00:19:25,811 --> 00:19:30,064
- l like her in that movie about TV. - Network, yeah, she was good.

211
00:19:30,148 --> 00:19:33,234
And that guy says he's not gonna take any more shit from anybody.

212
00:19:33,318 --> 00:19:35,903
- Peter Finch. - Yeah! Peter Finch.

213
00:19:35,987 --> 00:19:40,032
''l'm mad as hell, and l'm not gonna take any more of your shit!''

214
00:19:42,493 --> 00:19:44,828
ln that part where they get shot, l can remember thinkin' to myself,

215
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:50,083
thinkin', ''Hey, that wouldn't be such a bad way to go, if you had to.''

216
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,227
You sure are easy to talk to.

217
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:21,194
l was thinkin', if we met under different circumstances--

218
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:24,905
if you were in a bar and l came up and we started talkin'--

219
00:20:24,948 --> 00:20:27,533
- l wonder what would happen. - Nothing.

220
00:20:27,575 --> 00:20:30,744
- lf you didn't know who l was. - You'd probably tell me.

221
00:20:30,786 --> 00:20:33,997
- Just saying if we met under different circumstances-- - You have got to be kidding.

222
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:37,042
Yeah. Yeah.

223
00:20:37,084 --> 00:20:41,963
Another movie l liked with Faye Dunaway was Three Days of the Condor.

224
00:20:42,046 --> 00:20:44,715
The one with Robert Redford when he was young.

225
00:20:44,757 --> 00:20:46,717
Yeah.

226
00:20:48,844 --> 00:20:52,013
You know, l never thought it made sense, though--

227
00:20:52,097 --> 00:20:55,099
you know, the way they got together so quick.

228
00:20:55,142 --> 00:20:57,102
Why not?

229
00:20:57,143 --> 00:20:59,436
- l mean, romantically. - Mm-hmm.

230
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,109
Well, but it-- if-- uh. All right.

231
00:21:06,652 --> 00:21:09,279
Here we go. All right. Where the hell are we?

232
00:21:09,321 --> 00:21:11,322
At the turnpike. Glenn's right above us with the other car.

233
00:21:11,406 --> 00:21:14,408
- All right, c'mon. Hop on out. - Turn around and get your hands up!

234
00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:16,536
Shit!

235
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:18,829
We may as well leave her. We're leavin' the car...

236
00:21:18,913 --> 00:21:20,664
and we gotta leave her someplace, anyway-- what's the difference where?

237
00:21:20,748 --> 00:21:23,625
- She's comin' with us. - Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?

238
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:26,586
- Look for a name. - l already looked.

239
00:21:26,628 --> 00:21:29,964
Her name is Karen Sisco. Like the Cisco Kid, only spelled different.

240
00:21:30,006 --> 00:21:32,132
S-l-S-C-O.

241
00:21:36,804 --> 00:21:38,722
Karen?

242
00:21:38,806 --> 00:21:42,017
All right, Karen? You be a good girl, now.

243
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,144
l'm gonna open up the trunk.

244
00:21:44,186 --> 00:21:48,481
Hey, hey, hey, now! Now, you're puttin' holes in your car!

245
00:21:48,523 --> 00:21:54,361
l'm not leavin' you. l'm gonna open the trunk enough for you to drop your pistol out.

246
00:21:54,445 --> 00:21:58,073
Now, if you shoot, Buddy's got your shotgun, he's gonna shoot back.

247
00:21:58,157 --> 00:22:00,992
There's nothin' l can do about it, so it's up to you.

248
00:22:01,076 --> 00:22:05,997
Hey. Don't! lt's Glenn! Whoa!

249
00:22:06,081 --> 00:22:09,542
Fuck! Hey, hey, Jack. Good to see you, man.

250
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:13,003
What the fuck are you guys shooting at?

251
00:22:13,045 --> 00:22:15,255
- Do we need 'im? - The cop saw this car.

252
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:18,300
- He might tie it to the break and turn around. - All right.

253
00:22:18,342 --> 00:22:22,887
- Hey, Studs. We didn't recognize ya. - Hey, ''Studs,'' man.

254
00:22:22,971 --> 00:22:28,058
l haven't heard that since Lompoc, man. So what's goin' on?

255
00:22:29,393 --> 00:22:31,353
Aw, nothin'.

256
00:22:32,396 --> 00:22:36,399
Karen. Are you comin' out?

257
00:22:39,694 --> 00:22:42,404
- You hear that? - Okay!

258
00:22:43,698 --> 00:22:45,658
Okay.

259
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:55,834
You win, Jack.

260
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,262
Now, you get your clothes cleaned, you send me the bill.

261
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,306
l'll send it to you at Glades.

262
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,726
What, did you crawl through a sewer, man? Who're you?

263
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:18,187
- Take your sunglasses off. - l see better with 'em on, man.

264
00:23:18,229 --> 00:23:20,522
You don't take 'em off l'm gonna throw them off while they're still on your head.

265
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:25,736
- Go wait in the car. - Um, we're in civilization now, so you can ease up a little bit.

266
00:23:25,778 --> 00:23:30,031
l'm sorry. l'd like you to wait in the car, please. Take her, put her in the back.

267
00:23:30,073 --> 00:23:34,034
- Okay. ln the trunk? - ln the backseat! ln the backseat!

268
00:23:34,077 --> 00:23:37,455
- Backseat. Okay, you gotta come now, 'cause l gotta do this-- - Gimme your jacket.

269
00:23:37,538 --> 00:23:39,915
Somebody forgot to bring the clean clothes.

270
00:23:39,957 --> 00:23:42,042
l brought 'em. They're at Glades in the back of the Cadillac.

271
00:23:42,084 --> 00:23:44,419
You decided to jump into the trunk of her car.

272
00:23:44,503 --> 00:23:47,046
You can blame me if you want. l don't mind.

273
00:23:47,089 --> 00:23:50,758
- Here, sir. - l'll tell you--

274
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,385
- What's your problem, Jack? - l don't know why you got Glenn involved in this.

275
00:23:53,428 --> 00:23:55,763
- How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with? - ldea--

276
00:23:55,846 --> 00:23:57,931
The guy's got a fuckin' vacant lot for a head.

277
00:23:57,973 --> 00:24:01,934
He thinks he can talk to me like that? Shit.

278
00:24:01,977 --> 00:24:06,939
''Gimme your jacket.'' l have been sitting here for over a half-hour,

279
00:24:06,982 --> 00:24:10,777
watchin' out for the Highway Patrol, if you think that's fun.

280
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,321
God. You know, l hadda go over there in the bushes...

281
00:24:14,405 --> 00:24:18,742
to smoke a joint, just so l could like-- you know?

282
00:24:18,784 --> 00:24:23,621
Yep. l got somethin' big lined up, up north.

283
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:28,000
Yeah, these guys? Wouldn't even fuckin' know about it if it wasn't for me.

284
00:24:28,084 --> 00:24:31,545
- Every time he opens his mouth, l wanna punch him out. - He's not the problem, Jack.

285
00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:34,590
You wanna pull your head outta your ass, tell me why the hell we're bringing her with us?

286
00:24:34,632 --> 00:24:36,884
Glenn.

287
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:39,260
You don't remember me, do you?

288
00:24:41,263 --> 00:24:45,975
Um, couldn't have been Glades if that's what you're thinkin', 'cause l was never out there.

289
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:49,854
- No, that's not what l'm thinking. - Oh, yeah?

290
00:24:49,937 --> 00:24:53,440
But you're sure we've met, huh?

291
00:24:53,482 --> 00:24:55,191
Last fall.

292
00:24:55,275 --> 00:25:00,321
l drove you from the Palm Beach County Jail to the federal courthouse... twice.

293
00:25:00,405 --> 00:25:02,740
You're Glenn Michaels.

294
00:25:02,824 --> 00:25:05,534
l never forget anybody l've cuffed and shackled.

295
00:25:05,618 --> 00:25:08,328
Now let's think about this for a minute, Glenn, see if we can't work it out.

296
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,039
Do we have a gun in the car?

297
00:25:12,124 --> 00:25:14,959
Oh, shit! l remember you! Hey!

298
00:25:15,001 --> 00:25:18,337
Foley's not gonna make it, and if he goes down, you go with him.

299
00:25:18,379 --> 00:25:21,214
- Now, look. l can understand if you guys are close, but-- - No, we're not.

300
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:26,512
- But, yeah. l'm helpin' him. - Now wait a minute, Glenn.

301
00:25:26,595 --> 00:25:28,513
Have you helped him?

302
00:25:28,597 --> 00:25:32,767
l mean, technically, at this point, l doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive.

303
00:25:32,851 --> 00:25:34,811
So you still have a choice.

304
00:25:34,853 --> 00:25:38,856
You wanna take her to my place, get cleaned up, come out of the bathroom...

305
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,026
with your aftershave on, and she goes, ''Oh. l had you all wrong.''

306
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:44,027
No. l just wanna talk to her again, that's all.

307
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:47,906
l just wanna see what it might have been like under normal circumstances.

308
00:25:47,989 --> 00:25:50,407
lt's too late for that, Jack.

309
00:25:50,492 --> 00:25:52,702
He wants to get out of here, and l don't blame him.

310
00:26:31,654 --> 00:26:35,615
Ref don't call it soon, Snoop's gonna send this cat out in a body bag.

311
00:26:37,076 --> 00:26:39,786
Anybody ever tell you why they call him ''Snoopy''?

312
00:26:41,997 --> 00:26:44,582
He used to be Maurice ''Mad Dog'' Miller...

313
00:26:44,624 --> 00:26:47,084
back when he was a pro.

314
00:26:48,753 --> 00:26:50,754
Now you pet him, he goes down.

315
00:26:56,968 --> 00:26:59,929
- l don't believe it! - Oh, my!

316
00:27:04,434 --> 00:27:07,269
Bullshit! Bullshit!

317
00:27:10,606 --> 00:27:12,774
Yeah, you the man.

318
00:27:17,862 --> 00:27:20,114
Guy's bragging he won a thrown fight.

319
00:27:20,156 --> 00:27:22,116
Fuckin' pathetic.

320
00:27:25,953 --> 00:27:27,871
Dangerous is what it is.

321
00:27:31,541 --> 00:27:34,960
- Who's the bald dude? - Richard Ripley.

322
00:27:35,045 --> 00:27:37,463
The Wall Street guy?

323
00:27:37,547 --> 00:27:40,299
Call him Dick The Ripper on account of all the guys he ripped off.

324
00:27:40,341 --> 00:27:43,593
Oh, yeah. l didn't recognize him without his rug.

325
00:27:43,636 --> 00:27:45,679
- What's his bid? - Three years.

326
00:27:45,763 --> 00:27:48,807
You guys on the bench? Okay.

327
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:52,977
Three years, fined $50 million and wrote 'em a fuckin' check.

328
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:54,979
Just like that.

329
00:27:55,063 --> 00:27:57,732
Fifty mill, signed his name.

330
00:27:57,815 --> 00:28:00,901
Didn't even-- Didn't even-- Okay, a little help.

331
00:28:00,985 --> 00:28:02,819
Okay, heavy!

332
00:28:02,861 --> 00:28:04,821
Heavy! Come on!

333
00:28:08,491 --> 00:28:12,369
All the bright glare out here, you couldn't read the numbers on the weights.

334
00:28:12,453 --> 00:28:15,330
Oh. l had it. Jesus.

335
00:28:15,373 --> 00:28:19,168
- How do you know he wrote a check? - Uh, he told me.

336
00:28:19,209 --> 00:28:21,836
We work laundry together.

337
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:24,172
Guy loves to fucking talk.

338
00:28:24,214 --> 00:28:27,425
Yeah, he loves to talk. He talked to the U.S. attorney.

339
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:30,011
Rolled over on all the snitches he was doing business with.

340
00:28:30,094 --> 00:28:34,514
Hey! Any guy who can write a fuckin' check for $50 million,

341
00:28:34,557 --> 00:28:38,185
he says anything, l'm all fuckin' ears.

342
00:28:38,227 --> 00:28:42,188
Guy tells me he's got all this money in foreign banks.

343
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,648
Plus, around, mmm,

344
00:28:44,691 --> 00:28:48,569
five million in uncut diamonds at his house.

345
00:28:48,653 --> 00:28:50,571
He said, quote,

346
00:28:50,655 --> 00:28:53,532
that l can get my hands on it at any time.

347
00:28:53,574 --> 00:28:55,826
- Where does he live? - Detroit.

348
00:28:55,868 --> 00:29:01,039
Snoopy Miller says that uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.

349
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,876
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs?

350
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,754
Looks just like a plain, old rock.

351
00:29:08,838 --> 00:29:12,883
Wait, you think this guy's lying?

352
00:29:15,218 --> 00:29:18,596
What do you think, Studs? Use your head. Some guy's got $5 million...

353
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:23,309
socked away in his house, and he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it.

354
00:29:24,727 --> 00:29:27,229
Oh, l see. You guys are cynical. Right.

355
00:29:38,198 --> 00:29:40,116
Here it comes.

356
00:29:53,753 --> 00:29:56,588
Keep on walking. Keep walking.

357
00:29:56,631 --> 00:29:59,049
You don't wanna be answering any questions.

358
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,933
l'm just saying she wasn't scared, that's all.

359
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:12,269
That's 'cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time waitin' to make her move.

360
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:15,188
You're just jealous 'cause it was me in the trunk with her...

361
00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:17,191
- and not you. - You're right.

362
00:30:17,275 --> 00:30:21,070
The first thing l'm gonna do... is get this mud off me.

363
00:31:54,863 --> 00:31:56,906
Hey.

364
00:32:25,766 --> 00:32:27,892
Karen?

365
00:32:29,144 --> 00:32:30,270
Karen, honey?

366
00:32:30,353 --> 00:32:33,647
Karen?

367
00:32:33,731 --> 00:32:36,066
You were talking in your sleep.

368
00:32:40,904 --> 00:32:43,072
What'd l say?

369
00:32:43,156 --> 00:32:45,074
''Hey, yourself.''

370
00:32:47,077 --> 00:32:50,079
Huh.

371
00:32:50,163 --> 00:32:52,665
Hello, Daniel.

372
00:32:57,961 --> 00:33:02,423
Daniel Burdon, F.B.l.

373
00:33:02,465 --> 00:33:04,883
Marshall Sisco, Karen's dad.

374
00:33:04,926 --> 00:33:06,886
- Hmm. - Hmm.

375
00:33:06,928 --> 00:33:08,888
Umm--

376
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:12,099
Would you mind, please, waiting outside?

377
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:14,267
We have some business to do here.

378
00:33:16,562 --> 00:33:18,939
Well, uh, l have to use the john anyway.

379
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,940
- Excuse me. - Yeah.

380
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,947
l wanna be on the task force, Daniel.

381
00:33:29,031 --> 00:33:31,324
Well--

382
00:33:31,408 --> 00:33:35,912
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but...

383
00:33:35,954 --> 00:33:40,041
l got all the help l can use right now.

384
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:44,587
lnstead, let's talk about how you got that bump on your head.

385
00:33:44,629 --> 00:33:47,131
lsn't that my file you're holding on to?

386
00:33:47,173 --> 00:33:50,384
Yes, but l want to hear it from you,

387
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:53,970
starting... with when you grabbed the wheel.

388
00:33:54,054 --> 00:33:56,889
Where was this?

389
00:33:56,973 --> 00:33:58,891
Coming to the Okeechobee exit.

390
00:33:58,975 --> 00:34:02,144
- Sit back! - Can you see with those glasses on?

391
00:34:02,186 --> 00:34:04,980
l'm fine! This is... stupid, man.

392
00:34:05,022 --> 00:34:07,482
These guys are gonna be so disappointed in me, man.

393
00:34:07,524 --> 00:34:09,859
You know what? lf l wasn't stoned,

394
00:34:09,943 --> 00:34:12,904
there is no way that you would have talked me into this.

395
00:34:12,988 --> 00:34:15,823
- Remember that. - Get off at the exit right after that bridge.

396
00:34:15,865 --> 00:34:19,451
No, l am not fucking turning myself in, so forget it!

397
00:34:19,493 --> 00:34:21,619
- Get off at that exit! - What exit?

398
00:34:21,662 --> 00:34:24,080
-That exit right there. Take that exit! -Sit back! No!

399
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:33,964
The next thing l knew,

400
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:37,426
the paramedics were pulling me out of the car.

401
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,345
- You all right? - There's a couple of points l keep wondering about--

402
00:34:40,387 --> 00:34:42,555
have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.

403
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,684
Buddy, is it? And this fella Jack Foley.

404
00:34:46,768 --> 00:34:50,437
l swear, the man must have robbed over 200 banks in his time.

405
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:52,439
- Really? - Um-hmm.

406
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:54,775
He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.

407
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:57,361
Then you talked to him.

408
00:34:57,444 --> 00:34:59,821
ln the trunk, yeah.

409
00:34:59,863 --> 00:35:02,406
What'd you talk about?

410
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:04,534
Different things.

411
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,453
Prison, movies.

412
00:35:07,537 --> 00:35:12,207
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?

413
00:35:14,501 --> 00:35:17,336
lt was an unusual experience.

414
00:35:17,379 --> 00:35:20,381
You know, Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman.

415
00:35:20,423 --> 00:35:24,051
The one that you were seeing, it turns out, the same time he was robbing banks.

416
00:35:24,093 --> 00:35:26,553
- Do you recall that? - And what happened to Carl?

417
00:35:26,596 --> 00:35:30,557
The time came, you shot him. But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.

418
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:35,186
They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk.

419
00:35:35,229 --> 00:35:37,647
Okay. Now you got your Sig in your hand,

420
00:35:37,731 --> 00:35:40,108
and you say in the report that you couldn't turn around.

421
00:35:40,191 --> 00:35:43,485
He had you pinned down. But when the trunk opened,

422
00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:46,238
how come you didn't cap the two guys then?

423
00:35:46,322 --> 00:35:49,700
What do you work on most of the time? Fraud? Go after crooked bookkeepers?

424
00:35:49,742 --> 00:35:54,329
Karen, l've been with the bureau 15 years on all kinds of investigations.

425
00:35:54,413 --> 00:35:57,332
- Have you ever shot a man? - No.

426
00:35:57,415 --> 00:36:00,876
- When was the last time you were primary through the door? - l have to qualify?

427
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,920
You have to know what you're talking about.

428
00:36:07,758 --> 00:36:10,427
We'll talk another time. All right, Karen?

429
00:36:13,263 --> 00:36:16,932
l'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you anymore.

430
00:36:19,936 --> 00:36:21,312
You'll have to ask him that.

431
00:36:37,451 --> 00:36:39,452
Rip, Rip.

432
00:36:39,495 --> 00:36:42,497
- What the deal is, baby? - Hi, Maurice.

433
00:36:42,581 --> 00:36:45,041
- Oops. l don't know. - Make a fist--

434
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:47,627
- There you go. - Fuck it, man.

435
00:36:47,669 --> 00:36:49,879
- Got your little fishies for you. - Oh, good.

436
00:36:49,963 --> 00:36:55,134
Not so fast. Starting out, there's gonna be an across the board cost of living increase.

437
00:36:55,217 --> 00:36:58,761
- What? - When l got put in here a year ago on credit card fraud,

438
00:36:58,804 --> 00:37:00,764
l didn't really get no props for that.

439
00:37:00,806 --> 00:37:04,601
But ever since l shanked that loudmouth pussy in the yard,

440
00:37:04,643 --> 00:37:09,147
it's like my Dun and Broadstreet around this bitch done shot way the fuck up.

441
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:13,191
Actually, it's Dun and Bradstreet. That's the, uh--

442
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:15,568
Well, l've heard it both ways.

443
00:37:15,653 --> 00:37:18,238
Point is that the price has gone up around this bitch too.

444
00:37:18,322 --> 00:37:21,283
Get your little black book out. We got some business to talk about.

445
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:26,579
For the little fishies-- What'd l say they was gonna be?

446
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:29,790
- Two thousand. - Now they're gonna be three thousand.

447
00:37:29,832 --> 00:37:32,834
- Come on. You-- - Now they're gonna be three thousand.

448
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,338
That saltwater shit you put in your eyes?

449
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:40,216
- What do you call that? - Bausch & Lomb.

450
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,386
Yeah, that bushy lawn shit. That's 300.

451
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:46,763
- l need it. - Yeah, you do. And that extra pillow.

452
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:50,016
l'm gonna get that for you, but that's gonna be like five C's.

453
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,018
- Five? - Hey.

454
00:37:52,102 --> 00:37:55,521
Sign says shut the fuck up, or can't you fellas read?

455
00:37:55,605 --> 00:37:57,773
Who the fuck you talkin' to, man?

456
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:01,360
You got a problem over there, Foley?

457
00:38:01,444 --> 00:38:06,573
Yeah, this is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dumb shakedowns.

458
00:38:06,657 --> 00:38:08,950
- Five hundred bucks for a pillow? - That's right.

459
00:38:09,034 --> 00:38:12,161
- lt does seem a little high, doesn't it? - Shut up, Dick.

460
00:38:12,204 --> 00:38:14,372
- Must be a nice pillow. - Full goose down.

461
00:38:14,414 --> 00:38:17,375
- Look, you still-- - How much for your company at chow?

462
00:38:17,417 --> 00:38:20,711
My company? Come on, man. You know l'll watch this motherfucker's back.

463
00:38:20,795 --> 00:38:23,464
- How much? - That's a C-note.

464
00:38:25,799 --> 00:38:28,551
lf you're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.

465
00:38:28,594 --> 00:38:30,554
Really?

466
00:38:30,595 --> 00:38:33,222
Well, l-- l-- l don't know.

467
00:38:33,306 --> 00:38:36,642
First of all, if he kills you, then he's gonna get nothin'.

468
00:38:36,726 --> 00:38:40,062
Well, uh, the man don't just have to die, Foley.

469
00:38:40,104 --> 00:38:44,149
He could accidentally hurt himself falling down on something real hard.

470
00:38:44,233 --> 00:38:48,069
Like a shiv or my dick.

471
00:38:48,153 --> 00:38:50,822
l'll pay. l'll pay it. Don't worry.

472
00:38:50,905 --> 00:38:53,240
lf he falls on anything, Snoop,

473
00:38:53,324 --> 00:38:57,077
then they're gonna transfer his ass outta here faster than you can throw a fight...

474
00:38:57,161 --> 00:38:59,413
and you're still gonna get nothin'.

475
00:38:59,455 --> 00:39:02,040
You know, last time l checked, man,

476
00:39:02,082 --> 00:39:04,542
this shit over here ain't got nothin' to do with you.

477
00:39:04,584 --> 00:39:07,378
Why don't you go outside? Smoke a cigarette or some shit.

478
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,713
l don't smoke.

479
00:39:09,756 --> 00:39:12,550
You heard the man. Why don't you get your punk ass up outta here?

480
00:39:12,592 --> 00:39:16,220
- Uh-oh. - You fucked up now, man. That's Himey.

481
00:39:16,262 --> 00:39:19,765
Protege of mine. Ranked number 32 in the federal prison system.

482
00:39:19,848 --> 00:39:21,766
- Thirty-two? - That's right.

483
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:24,435
- Out of, what, 20. - Kick this cracker's ass.

484
00:39:32,151 --> 00:39:34,361
- What's going on here? - Uh, nothin'.

485
00:39:34,445 --> 00:39:38,073
Just ''reading is fundamental'' shit. We got all excited and everything.

486
00:39:38,115 --> 00:39:40,116
Clear outta here. Now.

487
00:39:40,158 --> 00:39:42,535
- No problem. - All of you. Let's go.

488
00:39:46,837 --> 00:39:49,357
Uh, Snoopy. l think we settled the fish thing.

489
00:39:49,641 --> 00:39:51,559
Oh, the fish. Yeah.

490
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:04,987
That's how you do the shake, partner.

491
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:13,996
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.

492
00:40:14,038 --> 00:40:15,998
They say anything about Karen?

493
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,000
Just that she got away. Here.

494
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:20,085
- Hmm? - Jack!

495
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:22,087
- Hey! - That's all right. lt's in the pool.

496
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:25,215
Did it say what happened to her after she took off with Glenn?

497
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:27,216
l don't know. You'll have to ask Glenn.

498
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,969
He's probably on his way to Detroit, which is where we should be.

499
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:33,013
- Yeah. - Do you realize what you're doing?

500
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,515
Worrying about a woman who works for law enforcement?

501
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:39,144
You wanna sit down and have cocktails with a woman who tried to shoot you.

502
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:42,438
- Do you hear what l'm saying? - Do you think this old guy's her boyfriend?

503
00:40:42,522 --> 00:40:44,440
lt's the only picture she has in here.

504
00:40:44,524 --> 00:40:46,942
Am l going to Detroit by myself?

505
00:40:47,026 --> 00:40:49,194
The longer we stay here, the better chance there is...

506
00:40:49,278 --> 00:40:51,196
that either Glenn is gonna screw up the score,

507
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,366
or we gonna get busted or both.

508
00:40:58,704 --> 00:41:00,664
This is Foley?

509
00:41:00,705 --> 00:41:03,123
- Karen? - Hmm?

510
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:07,336
- This is Foley? - How lucky can one guy be

511
00:41:07,378 --> 00:41:10,505
Doesn't even look like that.

512
00:41:10,548 --> 00:41:14,384
- Oh, no? - Uh-uh. He looks a lot like--

513
00:41:16,845 --> 00:41:18,763
Different.

514
00:41:24,143 --> 00:41:26,561
Wyatt Earp is here.

515
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:35,236
- Hey. - Hey.

516
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,738
- How you feelin'? Feel better? - Good. Yeah.

517
00:41:37,822 --> 00:41:40,783
- ls your dad taking good care of you? - He took the week off...

518
00:41:40,867 --> 00:41:44,411
to take care of me and he's worked on his boat every day since.

519
00:41:44,495 --> 00:41:46,788
- Dad, this is Ray Nicolet. - Hi.

520
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:50,250
- Pleasure to meet you. l heard a lot about you. - Likewise.

521
00:41:50,292 --> 00:41:53,711
Ray's working with the F.B.l. task force on the prison break.

522
00:41:53,753 --> 00:41:57,631
l see that. Tell me, Ray, do you ever wear one that says ''undercover''?

523
00:42:00,301 --> 00:42:02,844
- No. - How's it going?

524
00:42:02,928 --> 00:42:04,846
Sit down.

525
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:08,433
Okay. Good. We caught one of them.

526
00:42:08,558 --> 00:42:10,518
- Was it Foley? - Was it off a tip?

527
00:42:10,602 --> 00:42:14,105
Somebody spotted two of them out in this hobo camp near the airport.

528
00:42:14,147 --> 00:42:16,273
Called in the number. That was it.

529
00:42:16,357 --> 00:42:19,276
- l knew it as soon as l as there was a reward. - Was it Foley?

530
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,362
No, Linares, one of the Cubans.

531
00:42:22,446 --> 00:42:25,907
We went in there with full SWAT, two choppers, that whole deal.

532
00:42:25,949 --> 00:42:28,409
Linares goes nuts, starts shooting, so we took him out.

533
00:42:28,451 --> 00:42:31,412
l don't know how Chirino got away, but he did.

534
00:42:31,454 --> 00:42:34,456
- And Foley hadn't been there. - No, this place was strictly Cuban.

535
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:38,752
Foley had a ride. He must have his own agenda. You know what l mean?

536
00:42:38,794 --> 00:42:42,130
He seems to be the only guy who kinda knows what he's doing.

537
00:42:42,214 --> 00:42:44,132
Uh-huh.

538
00:42:44,216 --> 00:42:46,843
- Excuse me. - Yeah.

539
00:42:46,926 --> 00:42:48,927
Hello?

540
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:51,639
Yeah, she is. Just a minute, please.

541
00:42:51,722 --> 00:42:53,640
Karen.

542
00:42:53,724 --> 00:42:56,518
- Hello? - Hi.

543
00:42:57,978 --> 00:43:01,522
You know who this is?

544
00:43:01,606 --> 00:43:04,858
Yes. Five minutes.

545
00:43:11,574 --> 00:43:13,492
So. Ray.

546
00:43:13,575 --> 00:43:16,285
- Yeah. - There's something l'm wondering.

547
00:43:16,328 --> 00:43:20,206
The headline reads, ''l slept with a murderer, says shaken Miami woman.''

548
00:43:20,373 --> 00:43:23,459
- Who is it that answered the phone? - None of your business.

549
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:26,420
l'm just worried maybe l'm not old enough for you.

550
00:43:26,504 --> 00:43:29,965
- lt was my dad. - Really?

551
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:34,010
- He's got a cop's face. - How do you know?

552
00:43:34,094 --> 00:43:37,847
- Oh, wait. You have my wallet. - And your gun.

553
00:43:37,931 --> 00:43:40,308
- Think l can have 'em back? - How do we do that?

554
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:43,311
You can come by my dad's place and drop 'em off.

555
00:43:43,352 --> 00:43:46,187
l could leave it with the SWAT guy that answers the door.

556
00:43:46,272 --> 00:43:49,024
There's a guy here on the task force right now.

557
00:43:49,066 --> 00:43:51,609
Maybe l should put him on the phone and let the two of you work it out.

558
00:43:51,693 --> 00:43:53,861
- You wouldn't do that. - Why not?

559
00:43:53,945 --> 00:43:57,531
Because you're having too much fun.

560
00:43:57,615 --> 00:43:59,533
She fixes him pork chops and rice.

561
00:43:59,617 --> 00:44:02,369
The next thing you know, they're making love on the sofa.

562
00:44:02,453 --> 00:44:04,454
She says he was very gentle.

563
00:44:04,538 --> 00:44:08,291
This guy, Chirino, shows up at the house, says he misses his little girl.

564
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:12,003
She feels sorry for him. Next thing you know-- boom.

565
00:44:12,045 --> 00:44:15,089
- On the couch. - That's how you score now, huh?

566
00:44:16,632 --> 00:44:18,550
l guess.

567
00:44:18,634 --> 00:44:20,719
There's something l've been wondering.

568
00:44:20,761 --> 00:44:22,887
Whatever happened to your Uncle Cully?

569
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:25,307
You think he's gonna tell you where l am?

570
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:28,225
- Unless you wanna tell me. - He's dead.

571
00:44:28,268 --> 00:44:30,228
Did 27 years before he got out,

572
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:33,397
and he died a couple of years afterwards in a charity hospital...

573
00:44:33,439 --> 00:44:36,233
by trying to make up for all the good times he missed.

574
00:44:36,317 --> 00:44:38,402
That's not gonna be me.

575
00:44:38,485 --> 00:44:42,405
What, one last score, retire to some island? ls that the idea?

576
00:44:42,489 --> 00:44:45,116
- Jack. - l'm partial to mountains myself,

577
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,827
but if you like islands, we'll make it an island.

578
00:44:47,911 --> 00:44:52,081
- What do you mean, ''we'll make it an island''? - You and l can make it--

579
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:54,583
- Jack, you better come and check this out. - ls that Buddy?

580
00:44:54,667 --> 00:44:57,377
- What? No. Okay. Bye-bye. - Who're you talking to?

581
00:44:59,254 --> 00:45:01,172
- So she's a married woman. - Right.

582
00:45:01,256 --> 00:45:03,758
But she goes to bed with a prison escapee because...

583
00:45:03,842 --> 00:45:06,427
he tells her that he misses his little girl.

584
00:45:06,469 --> 00:45:09,471
She tells the world about it. But you protect her.

585
00:45:09,555 --> 00:45:12,390
You don't reveal her name.

586
00:45:12,433 --> 00:45:15,143
That makes it sound like what she was doing was okay...

587
00:45:15,227 --> 00:45:17,353
as long as her husband doesn't find out.

588
00:45:17,437 --> 00:45:22,107
Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't bother her.

589
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:24,110
- Dad. - What?

590
00:45:31,283 --> 00:45:34,410
Ray, l wanna show you something... in the living room.

591
00:45:35,662 --> 00:45:38,122
- Yeah. - Good talking to you, Ray.

592
00:45:38,248 --> 00:45:40,124
Yeah, you too.

593
00:45:44,128 --> 00:45:46,588
Federal law enforcement agents raided a squatters' camp...

594
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:49,299
north of Miami lnternational Airport this morning...

595
00:45:49,383 --> 00:45:54,637
in the hopes of capturing a fugitive from Tuesday's daring escape from Glades prison.

596
00:45:54,721 --> 00:45:58,557
F.B.l. officials confirm that one of the escapees, Arelio Linares,

597
00:45:58,641 --> 00:46:01,268
- was killed-- - Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.

598
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:04,604
Chino's runnin' for his life. He don't give a shit about you.

599
00:46:04,647 --> 00:46:08,483
He's gonna know by now l gave him up back at Glades. He's gonna wanna find me.

600
00:46:08,567 --> 00:46:11,444
Maybe see Adele, see what she knows.

601
00:46:11,486 --> 00:46:14,238
He knows where she lives?

602
00:46:14,322 --> 00:46:16,991
Jack!

603
00:46:17,033 --> 00:46:19,034
We were talking once, drinking rum,

604
00:46:19,118 --> 00:46:22,162
and l may have mentioned Adele.

605
00:46:22,204 --> 00:46:24,706
How she worked for a magician. Chino got all interested.

606
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:27,417
He said, ''How do you saw the woman in half?''

607
00:46:27,501 --> 00:46:30,753
Maybe he wanted to meet her, maybe see her if she came to visit.

608
00:46:30,837 --> 00:46:34,298
Oh, okay, okay. So you call her up and tell her don't talk to any Cubans.

609
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,551
- The phone's probably tapped by now. - You're right.

610
00:46:37,635 --> 00:46:40,053
And if the phone is tapped, you know they have her place staked out.

611
00:46:40,137 --> 00:46:41,888
Shit!

612
00:46:44,391 --> 00:46:46,351
Adele Delisi speaking.

613
00:46:46,393 --> 00:46:49,645
- Uh, uh, this is Adele? - Yes, it is.

614
00:46:49,687 --> 00:46:51,647
Oh-- Uh, sorry. Wrong number.

615
00:47:08,204 --> 00:47:10,456
Nice disguise.

616
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,458
l'm a tourist.

617
00:47:14,293 --> 00:47:17,045
All right. Here we go.

618
00:47:17,129 --> 00:47:21,299
Coming up right here... on the left.

619
00:47:21,383 --> 00:47:24,552
- What about the guy with the clippers? - l wonder what the F.B.l...

620
00:47:24,636 --> 00:47:27,263
is charging to trim hedges these days?

621
00:47:27,346 --> 00:47:31,558
- Quite a checker game they got goin' on too. - Pull on up.

622
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,248
Oh, man.

623
00:48:03,754 --> 00:48:06,047
Oh, man.

624
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:08,175
Okay, you saw her. That's all you get.

625
00:48:14,222 --> 00:48:17,850
- Let's go to Detroit. - Now you're talkin', brother.

626
00:48:19,602 --> 00:48:22,437
l'll say one thing for Jack-- he's very considerate.

627
00:48:22,521 --> 00:48:24,522
Lights on or off, if you know what l mean.

628
00:48:24,607 --> 00:48:26,441
- Really. - Hmm.

629
00:48:29,528 --> 00:48:31,988
Adele, listen--

630
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:36,784
l just want to find him before he does something else and makes it worse on himself.

631
00:48:36,868 --> 00:48:40,746
No. Buddy'll take care of him.

632
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:44,499
Keep him out of trouble. He's Jack's conscience, always has been.

633
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:48,294
They must have robbed 50 banks together.

634
00:48:48,378 --> 00:48:52,173
- They were a really great team. - Until they got busted.

635
00:48:52,215 --> 00:48:55,092
Hmm. That wasn't Jack's fault. No, that was on account of...

636
00:48:55,176 --> 00:48:59,805
Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to the job...

637
00:48:59,888 --> 00:49:02,223
before they'd done it instead of after.

638
00:49:02,266 --> 00:49:06,895
Well, she called the F.B.l. They both went down, and they ended up at Lompoc.

639
00:49:06,978 --> 00:49:10,022
l think Buddy felt kind of bad about that.

640
00:49:11,357 --> 00:49:14,359
Adele, do you have any idea where l could find Buddy?

641
00:49:14,402 --> 00:49:18,530
Or Glenn?

642
00:49:18,572 --> 00:49:21,115
Mira, Adele, you in there?

643
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:24,368
-Yes. -Mira, l'd like to speak to you, please.

644
00:49:24,411 --> 00:49:27,747
- Well, who is it? - Emile, you know, the guy you used to work for?

645
00:49:27,789 --> 00:49:30,875
- Uh-- - He gave me your number and where you live.

646
00:49:30,916 --> 00:49:34,460
Mira, l'm looking for an assistant. Can l speak to you, please?

647
00:49:34,545 --> 00:49:37,380
- Oh. Uh, yeah. - All right.

648
00:49:37,422 --> 00:49:39,423
You did work for Emile, right?

649
00:49:39,466 --> 00:49:42,635
Uh, yeah, l was Emile's box jumper for four years, almost.

650
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:44,637
Cono! You were what, his box?

651
00:49:44,721 --> 00:49:46,722
- Uh, his assistant. - Oh, okay.

652
00:49:48,808 --> 00:49:51,226
You say you perform in the Miami area?

653
00:49:51,268 --> 00:49:54,145
Oh, si. Here, there, you know.

654
00:49:54,229 --> 00:49:57,815
l was a magician in Cuba. They used to call me Manuelito the Magician.

655
00:49:57,899 --> 00:49:59,984
Mira, can you please open?

656
00:50:00,068 --> 00:50:03,863
- l'm not dressed. - l'm a good friend of Jack Foley.

657
00:50:03,946 --> 00:50:07,449
- You know Jack? - Who are you?

658
00:50:07,533 --> 00:50:09,618
Jose Chirino.

659
00:50:09,701 --> 00:50:13,788
Or maybe you heard Jack call me Chino. Bueno, l'm the same guy.

660
00:50:13,872 --> 00:50:16,958
Tell him he has to wait in the hall. You have to get dressed. Say it loud.

661
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:19,293
Wait in the hall. You have to get dressed.

662
00:50:19,335 --> 00:50:22,796
Mira, mira, you tell me where l could find Jack and l don't bother you no more.

663
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,465
Now, come on, please! Hello?

664
00:50:25,549 --> 00:50:29,093
- l don't know where he is. - l'm the guy that helped Jack escape from prison.

665
00:50:29,136 --> 00:50:32,764
- Mira, please open this fucking door-- - l'm gonna call the police.

666
00:50:32,806 --> 00:50:37,893
Cono, why you gonna do that to a friend, man? A partner to Jack?

667
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:42,064
That's it! That's it!

668
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:52,698
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Cono, mira, please!

669
00:50:52,782 --> 00:50:54,700
- Adele! Adele! - Give me your hand.

670
00:50:54,784 --> 00:50:57,661
- You not Adele! - l'm a federal marshal, and you're under arrest.

671
00:50:57,745 --> 00:51:00,706
- Get my bag, Adele. - Oh.

672
00:51:00,789 --> 00:51:02,832
Mira, please, please. l think there's a misunderstanding here.

673
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:04,835
Can you-- you got nice bag.

674
00:51:04,918 --> 00:51:08,671
Mira, let's say we just forget about it, okay? We forget about this, l go home--

675
00:51:08,755 --> 00:51:11,799
- Shut up. - Owwww! Who the hell taught you how to do that?

676
00:51:11,841 --> 00:51:13,967
- Give me your other hand. - Okay, okay. Ay, cono.

677
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:16,804
Ohhhh! l gotta go make pee-pee.

678
00:51:16,846 --> 00:51:19,640
Ohhhhh! Owww!

679
00:51:19,681 --> 00:51:22,183
Wow! You are mean!

680
00:51:22,225 --> 00:51:26,645
Look, l'm gonna call my lawyer. This is-- What do they call that? Human rights violation.

681
00:51:26,688 --> 00:51:29,857
- Ay, cono. - Daniel Burdon, please. Karen Sisco.

682
00:51:29,941 --> 00:51:32,693
Mira, Adele, Adele. Can l ask you a question, please?

683
00:51:32,777 --> 00:51:35,195
You know that trick you do?

684
00:51:35,279 --> 00:51:38,740
Karen? Where are you? l've been trying to reach you.

685
00:51:38,824 --> 00:51:41,076
When you in the box and they saw you in half?

686
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:44,203
- l'm at Adele Delisi's. - lt's magic.

687
00:51:44,245 --> 00:51:46,705
We already talked to her. That's a dead end.

688
00:51:46,748 --> 00:51:51,418
l was just wondering, if l brought in Chirino, would you let me be on the task force?

689
00:51:51,502 --> 00:51:53,879
- Yeah, sure, Karen. - Then they put the saw through, and they separate it.

690
00:51:53,962 --> 00:51:57,673
- And that's it. Ta da. - But how do you twinkle your toes? l don't get that.

691
00:51:57,716 --> 00:52:01,094
You bring Chirino in, and you can be on the task force.

692
00:52:01,177 --> 00:52:03,762
- That's all l wanted to know. - Good.

693
00:52:03,846 --> 00:52:07,057
Now, would you forget about the ex-wife,

694
00:52:07,141 --> 00:52:09,518
and get over to the Adams Hotel?

695
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,229
- You got it. - Then they open it up--

696
00:52:12,312 --> 00:52:15,022
- No! No! - Come on.

697
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:18,901
- And then that's it. - Fake legs.

698
00:52:18,943 --> 00:52:22,362
- Mmm. - Fake legs? How you gonna--

699
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:24,948
- Ay! Cono. - Thanks, Adele.

700
00:52:25,032 --> 00:52:27,242
How do they twinkle their toes, then, if it's fake, mira?

701
00:52:30,495 --> 00:52:33,164
First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn,

702
00:52:33,248 --> 00:52:36,334
and we find a window to throw him out of.

703
00:52:36,417 --> 00:52:38,335
l was thinkin', if l was Glenn, and l was up there...

704
00:52:38,419 --> 00:52:40,420
to take down the Ripper, where would l go?

705
00:52:40,463 --> 00:52:43,465
'Cept that if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinkin'.

706
00:52:43,549 --> 00:52:45,592
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from the joint?

707
00:52:45,676 --> 00:52:48,428
Snoop? l figured he'd be brain-dead by now.

708
00:52:48,512 --> 00:52:50,597
Nah, Snoop doesn't box anymore.

709
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,515
Glenn told me that he's managing some fighters out at the Kronk.

710
00:53:08,738 --> 00:53:11,281
- Did you get the key? - They're in room 613.

711
00:53:14,076 --> 00:53:17,454
All right. l want two men outside, front and back.

712
00:53:17,538 --> 00:53:22,250
Conroy, Jamison, go on up to six, cover both ends of the hall.

713
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:26,003
You're primary. You're secondary.

714
00:53:26,087 --> 00:53:28,547
And you're point man.

715
00:53:28,631 --> 00:53:32,300
- You gonna use a ram? - Yeah. Why?

716
00:53:32,385 --> 00:53:34,595
The manager's door is metal.

717
00:53:34,637 --> 00:53:36,680
You know what l mean, they might all be.

718
00:53:36,764 --> 00:53:40,058
A ram on a metal door makes a lot of noise for what good it does.

719
00:53:40,142 --> 00:53:42,977
l got a shock lock round for my shotgun that oughta do the trick.

720
00:53:43,061 --> 00:53:44,979
Fine. Whatever.

721
00:53:55,656 --> 00:53:57,574
Two, please.

722
00:53:59,868 --> 00:54:01,828
You.

723
00:54:05,915 --> 00:54:10,127
Fuck it. Let's take the stairs. Karen--

724
00:54:10,169 --> 00:54:13,338
Take the radio. Stay down here in the lobby and watch the elevator.

725
00:54:13,422 --> 00:54:17,258
- Daniel, l want to go upstairs. - Well, you can wait in the car if you want to.

726
00:54:18,927 --> 00:54:21,888
Now, you see Foley and Bragg coming behind us. What do you do?

727
00:54:21,971 --> 00:54:25,891
- Call and tell you? - And you let them come up.

728
00:54:25,975 --> 00:54:29,478
You don't try to make the bust yourself. You understand?

729
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:37,902
ls this your floor, ma'am?

730
00:54:39,153 --> 00:54:41,071
ls this your floor, ma'am?

731
00:54:41,155 --> 00:54:44,032
Oh. Oh, yes.

732
00:54:44,116 --> 00:54:46,951
Yes, it is. l'm sorry. Thank you.

733
00:54:50,539 --> 00:54:53,791
Be advised we are approaching the door.

734
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:06,052
Be advised we are going to blow the door.

735
00:55:15,811 --> 00:55:17,729
Going up?

736
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:35,204
Shit, l thought l was going up.

737
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:39,749
She just looked right at me.

738
00:55:39,791 --> 00:55:43,002
- Who? - Karen.

739
00:55:43,086 --> 00:55:46,589
- Karen Sisco? - Yeah.

740
00:55:46,673 --> 00:55:48,674
She's in the lobby.

741
00:55:48,758 --> 00:55:50,676
- She's in the lobby? - Yeah.

742
00:55:52,511 --> 00:55:55,805
They know where l live, no doubt they know what l drive. We gotta dump this car.

743
00:56:04,647 --> 00:56:06,857
She just sat there, looking right at me.

744
00:56:11,445 --> 00:56:15,448
Karen, they're not up here. Keep your eyes open.

745
00:56:16,491 --> 00:56:19,827
Karen? Karen, are you there?

746
00:56:20,787 --> 00:56:22,705
He waved at you?

747
00:56:22,705 --> 00:56:24,626
Couldn't swear to it, but l'm pretty sure he did.

748
00:56:24,709 --> 00:56:26,798
- Did you wave back? - l didn't have time.

749
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,887
l imagine you would have, though.

750
00:56:30,393 --> 00:56:32,356
Buddy's sister, Regina Mary Bragg,

751
00:56:32,398 --> 00:56:34,361
got two calls from Buddy in Detroit this morning.

752
00:56:34,404 --> 00:56:36,910
She calls Burdon. She's also the one who called Burdon...

753
00:56:36,953 --> 00:56:39,292
- and gave him Buddy's address. - So?

754
00:56:39,377 --> 00:56:42,635
So what l want to know is why he still calls her even after she turned him in.

755
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,767
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge. What l want to know is why,

756
00:56:44,809 --> 00:56:49,655
they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?

757
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,746
- Any thoughts on that? - None l'd like to share.

758
00:56:53,834 --> 00:56:56,340
- l'll call you when l get in. - Okay.

759
00:57:03,655 --> 00:57:06,495
Hey

760
00:57:22,041 --> 00:57:25,591
Time is truly wasting

761
00:57:25,676 --> 00:57:30,188
You know, l don't just deal product and manage fighters no more.

762
00:57:30,231 --> 00:57:34,910
A lot's changed since the last time you seen me, man. lt's like l've, uh,

763
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:37,751
vertically integrated myself, you know, diversified and shit,

764
00:57:37,793 --> 00:57:39,797
and now l'm into the occasional grand larceny,

765
00:57:39,884 --> 00:57:42,181
- home invasion, shit like that. - Huh.

766
00:57:42,265 --> 00:57:44,437
White Boy Bob right there's my all-around man, you know.

767
00:57:44,522 --> 00:57:49,577
He's my personal bodyguard when l feel like l need one, driver, shit like that.

768
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:52,167
Yo, man, watch the road, White Boy! What you lookin' back here for?

769
00:57:52,252 --> 00:57:56,347
- Yeah. - Yeah.

770
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,352
- l like this car, Glenn. - Yeah.

771
00:57:58,436 --> 00:58:00,525
You stole a good one, boy.

772
00:58:00,609 --> 00:58:03,658
You can roll around in Ripley's neighborhood up there in Bloomfield Hills,

773
00:58:03,743 --> 00:58:05,664
not get sweated by the private security.

774
00:58:05,749 --> 00:58:08,673
Ain't gonna have no police on our ass, nothing like that. lt's nice, man.

775
00:58:09,844 --> 00:58:11,807
Yeah.

776
00:58:11,849 --> 00:58:14,856
Oh, hey, so you still haven't said how you want to do this thing.

777
00:58:14,942 --> 00:58:19,328
Oh, l'm gonna tell you that as soon as we get one other brother l'm gonna need, uh,

778
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:21,334
Kenneth-- that's Moselle's brother--

779
00:58:21,377 --> 00:58:24,844
along with White Boy right there.

780
00:58:24,887 --> 00:58:26,683
- What? - All right, here we go, White Boy.

781
00:58:36,629 --> 00:58:39,093
Uh, who's the fireman?

782
00:58:41,141 --> 00:58:44,441
Ken dog.

783
00:58:44,485 --> 00:58:46,574
- What's up, brother-in-law? - What's happenin', hustler?

784
00:58:48,371 --> 00:58:50,877
Hey, man. This cigarette gonna bother you, Mo?

785
00:58:50,962 --> 00:58:54,972
Yeah, put that thing out, all right? Ken, this is Glenn.

786
00:58:55,057 --> 00:58:58,274
- Glenn, that's Kenny, the dude l was tellin' you about. - Hi.

787
00:58:58,316 --> 00:59:01,700
You're the one gonna help us rip off that rich white dude?

788
00:59:01,784 --> 00:59:05,251
- Yeah, that's him. - Help you?

789
00:59:05,336 --> 00:59:07,550
Go ahead, White Boy.

790
00:59:11,604 --> 00:59:15,782
Um, whoa, wait a minute, um, look--

791
00:59:15,866 --> 00:59:20,294
Maurice, l am letting you in on this gig,

792
00:59:20,379 --> 00:59:22,843
not--

793
00:59:22,886 --> 00:59:25,392
- You just asked how we gonna do it, right? - Yeah.

794
00:59:25,435 --> 00:59:27,398
Well, l'm telling you how, man. We the experts.

795
00:59:29,153 --> 00:59:31,074
Person l'm worried about is you, Glenn.

796
00:59:31,159 --> 00:59:33,916
- Me? - Yeah.

797
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:37,720
Can you step up and actually do this shit instead of just talking the talk?

798
00:59:38,932 --> 00:59:41,146
Do what?

799
00:59:40,812 --> 00:59:43,189
Walk into this house l got picked out.

800
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:45,816
Do this cross-dressing nigger named Eddie Solomon l used to sell to.

801
00:59:45,858 --> 00:59:49,778
- Been dealing on his own. - What? When, man?

802
00:59:49,862 --> 00:59:53,031
Shit, right now, son. What you think all this shit is for?

803
00:59:53,116 --> 00:59:56,202
l don't need to prove shit to you, man, okay?

804
00:59:56,244 --> 00:59:59,538
The Ripley job is my job. You're either in or you're not.

805
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:03,250
You wanna go pop some crack dealer pissed you off, man,

806
01:00:03,334 --> 01:00:06,337
- that is your problem, not mine, fuck! - Glenn,

807
01:00:06,379 --> 01:00:08,381
l know you supposed to be cool and everything, okay,

808
01:00:08,423 --> 01:00:10,466
but you ain't got to give me no tone of voice.

809
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:14,595
You don't like what l'm sayin', you just bounce the fuck out this whip anywhere up in here.

810
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:18,808
Okay, l think we're forgetting that this is my whip.

811
01:00:20,893 --> 01:00:23,937
l brought it up.

812
01:00:24,022 --> 01:00:29,610
Shit. Hey, come on, man. lf l say this is my car, you know this is my car.

813
01:00:29,694 --> 01:00:32,029
You just get yourself another one.

814
01:00:32,071 --> 01:00:35,491
lf l say we in on this Ripley shit, we in on it, with or without your punk ass.

815
01:00:35,575 --> 01:00:38,244
And if l say you gonna walk up in this house and do this motherfucker...

816
01:00:38,328 --> 01:00:40,288
so l can see if you got any balls or not,

817
01:00:40,371 --> 01:00:42,664
guess what else you gonna do?

818
01:00:42,749 --> 01:00:44,876
We're here.

819
01:00:46,086 --> 01:00:49,547
Tighten up your panties, boy.

820
01:00:51,591 --> 01:00:54,760
- Hacksaw. Okay, l'll take that. - Oh, yeah.

821
01:00:54,844 --> 01:00:57,179
- Hatchet, man. - Hatchet?

822
01:00:57,263 --> 01:01:01,100
What are you gonna do with a hatchet?

823
01:01:01,184 --> 01:01:04,478
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's get some fire to that ass.

824
01:01:04,646 --> 01:01:07,106
Look here. You want the .45 or the Glock?

825
01:01:09,526 --> 01:01:11,444
Glenn?

826
01:01:48,815 --> 01:01:50,775
Shit, boy.

827
01:02:02,496 --> 01:02:04,789
lt was worse than you thought it was gonna be, huh?

828
01:02:06,708 --> 01:02:09,127
You with the bad boys now, baby.

829
01:02:09,169 --> 01:02:11,129
Let's go.

830
01:02:21,265 --> 01:02:23,183
What do you think?

831
01:02:23,267 --> 01:02:26,853
l think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got ourselves another partner.

832
01:02:28,188 --> 01:02:31,524
Hey, Studs, how ya doin'?

833
01:02:31,608 --> 01:02:34,611
Jesus Christ, what are you guys doin' here?

834
01:02:34,695 --> 01:02:37,489
Weren't you expecting us?

835
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:41,410
Where's your sunglasses? Somebody finally step on 'em for ya?

836
01:02:41,493 --> 01:02:44,329
- l don't know. - Whose blood you got on your shirt?

837
01:02:44,371 --> 01:02:47,624
Listen, man, these guys are crazy.

838
01:02:47,708 --> 01:02:50,001
- Snoop! - Shit.

839
01:02:50,044 --> 01:02:52,421
We have a problem here?

840
01:02:52,504 --> 01:02:55,423
Jack Foley, famous bank robber.

841
01:02:55,507 --> 01:02:58,259
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.

842
01:02:58,344 --> 01:03:01,305
Seems l read somewhere that you broke out of a prison down in Florida.

843
01:03:01,388 --> 01:03:03,598
- ls that right? - They got a low class of people there, Snoop.

844
01:03:03,682 --> 01:03:06,101
Hey, you call him that again l'm gonna put your head through the wall.

845
01:03:08,062 --> 01:03:10,522
What? You mean ''Snoop''?

846
01:03:12,024 --> 01:03:16,069
Nobody calls me Snoop or Snoopy anymore is what White Boy Bob is trying to tell you.

847
01:03:16,153 --> 01:03:18,530
He's just a little crude with it. You know what l mean?

848
01:03:18,572 --> 01:03:20,824
Nah, l left all that behind me, partner.

849
01:03:20,908 --> 01:03:22,826
But you call this bozo ''White Boy.''

850
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:26,038
White Boy Bob used to be a fighter.

851
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,916
Oh, so tell me, what do you do now, White Boy Bob,

852
01:03:28,999 --> 01:03:30,917
outside of shoot your big mouth off?

853
01:03:33,921 --> 01:03:36,632
- Like being back in the yard, isn't it? - Yeah, just like it.

854
01:03:36,716 --> 01:03:38,718
Nobody backing down or nothing.

855
01:03:38,759 --> 01:03:42,095
You back down, you just a pussy.

856
01:03:42,179 --> 01:03:45,807
- Why y'all in Detroit anyway, up here in the cold? - Glenn didn't tell you?

857
01:03:45,891 --> 01:03:49,686
- Glenn? What? - l thought you guys were busted.

858
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:52,773
Why's that? 'Cause you left us standing on the side of the road?

859
01:03:52,857 --> 01:03:54,984
Whoops.

860
01:03:57,278 --> 01:04:00,030
Look, Snoop, l don't know what Glenn promised you,

861
01:04:00,114 --> 01:04:02,783
or what you think you're going to get out of this-- here's the deal:

862
01:04:02,825 --> 01:04:05,786
Buddy and l, we're going to take half of anything we get off of Ripley.

863
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:07,872
Anything else, you guys are allowed to cut up any way you want.

864
01:04:07,955 --> 01:04:10,832
Oh. Why don't we talk about this outside, man?

865
01:04:12,418 --> 01:04:16,630
- Nice in here. lt's warm. - Warm? lt's like 90 degrees in here, man.

866
01:04:16,714 --> 01:04:18,924
Sometimes it's 100 up in this mug.

867
01:04:18,966 --> 01:04:21,093
That's the way Emmanuel like to keep it.

868
01:04:21,135 --> 01:04:23,512
Keep his fighters mean and lean like Tommy Hearns. Ain't that right, Kenny?

869
01:04:23,596 --> 01:04:25,764
l got someplace to be anyway, so tell you what:

870
01:04:25,807 --> 01:04:27,767
Why don't y'all come by the fights Friday night?

871
01:04:27,809 --> 01:04:30,311
We'll sit down, chop it up, you know, look it over.

872
01:04:30,395 --> 01:04:33,523
- State Theater. - All right. We'll see you then.

873
01:04:42,991 --> 01:04:47,412
So it must take a lot of balls to walk into a bank and stick it up with a gun, huh?

874
01:04:47,495 --> 01:04:50,080
l don't know. l never used a gun before in my life.

875
01:04:50,164 --> 01:04:52,082
You're kidding.

876
01:04:52,166 --> 01:04:55,419
You'd be surprised what all you can get if you ask for it the right way.

877
01:04:55,503 --> 01:04:59,673
Well, you're the reason, my friend, that l don't keep all my money in the bank.

878
01:04:59,716 --> 01:05:02,009
So where do you keep your money, Dick?

879
01:05:02,093 --> 01:05:04,011
Talking about all those uncut diamonds you told about.

880
01:05:04,095 --> 01:05:07,348
- l know what you're talking about. - You're the one with balls.

881
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:09,433
Say something like that to somebody like Glenn?

882
01:05:09,517 --> 01:05:12,269
Glenn? Come on, nobody's going to believe Glenn.

883
01:05:12,353 --> 01:05:14,813
- Do you believe Glenn? - Uh, no, l don't.

884
01:05:14,856 --> 01:05:17,859
Besides, even if it was true, he'd still have to know where l keep 'em, wouldn't he?

885
01:05:17,942 --> 01:05:20,736
Doesn't have to know anything. You told him you keep 'em in your house.

886
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:24,615
lt's a very big house. So, how much longer you in here for?

887
01:05:24,699 --> 01:05:29,495
Uh, 22 months, three days, two hours.

888
01:05:29,537 --> 01:05:33,415
- Why? - 'Cause l could use a guy like you.

889
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:36,669
Somebody that knows how to ask for things in the right way.

890
01:05:36,711 --> 01:05:38,671
l'm talking about when you're out of here.

891
01:05:38,713 --> 01:05:41,173
After all, you can't rob banks forever, can you?

892
01:05:41,216 --> 01:05:44,219
- l'm not exactly a nine to five type. - Who is?

893
01:05:54,396 --> 01:05:56,314
l thought everybody liked Eddie.

894
01:05:58,024 --> 01:06:02,319
- How you doin', Ray? - l'm freezing.

895
01:06:02,404 --> 01:06:04,823
But l'm getting warmer.

896
01:06:04,906 --> 01:06:09,076
So listen, other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together,

897
01:06:09,161 --> 01:06:11,580
you want to tell me why you're coming to me instead of the F.B.l.?

898
01:06:11,621 --> 01:06:14,457
l go to the F.B.l., the first thing they're gonna do is send me to get some coffee.

899
01:06:14,541 --> 01:06:16,459
You know what? You're right.

900
01:06:16,543 --> 01:06:20,004
Ray, about a year ago, D.E.A. had a guy, Glenn Michaels, on possession with intent.

901
01:06:20,088 --> 01:06:23,466
- Listen, is that your car? Find out whose it is. - They couldn't make it stick.

902
01:06:23,550 --> 01:06:26,553
ln his statement, he said he was coming to Detroit to see a friend...

903
01:06:26,595 --> 01:06:28,597
about job opportunities, if you can believe that.

904
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,765
- What was the name of the friend? - Maurice Miller,

905
01:06:30,849 --> 01:06:33,852
also known as Snoopy, used to be a prizefighter.

906
01:06:33,936 --> 01:06:36,521
l know Snoopy. He's a fucking wack job.

907
01:06:36,605 --> 01:06:38,940
He thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard, hangs out over on the west side...

908
01:06:38,982 --> 01:06:41,776
with a couple of other first-rate nut cases.

909
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:44,112
- Well, l'm gonna need a last known address. - 2710 coming in.

910
01:06:44,196 --> 01:06:46,823
- You're gonna need what? - A last known address.

911
01:06:47,908 --> 01:06:50,702
That your car?

912
01:06:50,786 --> 01:06:53,789
No way. l don't want you talking to Miller alone.

913
01:06:53,831 --> 01:06:58,043
Come on, Ray. l'm a federal officer. l can handle myself. l'm armed.

914
01:07:00,379 --> 01:07:02,339
l'll call you tomorrow with the address.

915
01:07:04,883 --> 01:07:06,801
Thank you, Raymond.

916
01:07:06,885 --> 01:07:09,304
You see the paper?

917
01:07:09,346 --> 01:07:11,639
- lt's a terrific shot of her. - Outside of that.

918
01:07:11,724 --> 01:07:15,144
Doesn't say what she's doing here, but l don't think it has anything to do with us.

919
01:07:15,227 --> 01:07:17,771
She came up here on her vacation because she likes shitty weather.

920
01:07:17,813 --> 01:07:19,773
Nah, l think she's after Glenn.

921
01:07:19,815 --> 01:07:21,942
The girl still there?

922
01:07:21,984 --> 01:07:25,153
They don't stay the whole night, Jack, unless you pay for it.

923
01:07:25,237 --> 01:07:29,908
- Did you tell your sister? - Yeah, l just hung up. She prayed for me.

924
01:07:29,992 --> 01:07:33,328
- Mm-hmm. And how long were you on the phone with her? - Two hours.

925
01:07:33,412 --> 01:07:37,165
- And how long were you with the girl? - 45 minutes.

926
01:07:37,249 --> 01:07:39,167
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?

927
01:07:39,251 --> 01:07:41,670
Look, Jack, just forget about my sister, okay?

928
01:07:41,712 --> 01:07:44,631
Now, if Karen Sisco is tailing Glenn, we're fucked.

929
01:07:44,673 --> 01:07:46,758
Tomorrow night at the fights, we all get picked up.

930
01:07:46,842 --> 01:07:50,387
Why don't we just drive by where we're meeting tonight, check it out.

931
01:07:50,471 --> 01:07:52,389
And we'll go by Ripley's too, while we're at it.

932
01:07:52,473 --> 01:07:54,808
- Yeah, all right. - All right.

933
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:07,029
- Athenaeum Hotel, how may l help you? - Karen Sisco, please.

934
01:08:08,197 --> 01:08:10,449
- Hello, Best Western. - Karen Sisco, please.

935
01:08:14,662 --> 01:08:18,040
- Moselle Miller? - What do you want?

936
01:08:18,124 --> 01:08:22,211
- l'm looking for Maurice. - You find him, tell him the dog got run over.

937
01:08:22,295 --> 01:08:24,255
l'm out of grocery money.

938
01:08:24,338 --> 01:08:27,591
- Moselle, who you talkin' to? - Lady lookin' for Maurice.

939
01:08:27,675 --> 01:08:29,718
- What does she want? - Hasn't said.

940
01:08:29,802 --> 01:08:33,263
- That's not Maurice? - That's Kenneth, my brother. He's talkin' on the phone.

941
01:08:33,347 --> 01:08:36,058
- Ask her what she want with him! - You ask her!

942
01:08:36,142 --> 01:08:39,186
- Maurice business is none of my business. - Yeah, you damn right.

943
01:08:40,897 --> 01:08:43,107
State Theater, huh? Who's fightin'?

944
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:47,111
Nigger, what?

945
01:08:49,739 --> 01:08:52,450
l'm looking for somebody l think Maurice knows.

946
01:08:54,243 --> 01:08:56,411
You're not with probation, one of those?

947
01:08:56,496 --> 01:08:59,749
- No. - You a lawyer?

948
01:08:59,791 --> 01:09:02,919
No, l'm not. l'm looking for somebody named Glenn Michaels.

949
01:09:04,587 --> 01:09:07,881
Glenn? l don't know any Glenn.

950
01:09:07,924 --> 01:09:09,926
He said he stayed here last November.

951
01:09:10,009 --> 01:09:12,761
- Here in this house? - He said he stayed with Maurice.

952
01:09:12,845 --> 01:09:16,431
Well, he ain't even here that much.

953
01:09:16,474 --> 01:09:18,350
l'd like to know where he goes, but at the same time,

954
01:09:18,434 --> 01:09:21,270
l don't wanna know, you understand?

955
01:09:21,354 --> 01:09:24,273
Yeah.

956
01:09:24,357 --> 01:09:28,027
- You say your dog was killed? - Got run over by a car.

957
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:33,283
- What'd you call him? - Was a she. Named Tuffy.

958
01:09:35,618 --> 01:09:38,287
Where do you think l might find Maurice, Moselle?

959
01:09:38,371 --> 01:09:41,290
l don't know. The gym, the fights.

960
01:09:41,332 --> 01:09:45,461
l know he don't miss the fights. They're havin' some tomorrow down at the State Theater.

961
01:09:45,503 --> 01:09:47,838
- He used to take me. - The State Theater.

962
01:09:47,922 --> 01:09:50,174
Why you askin' all these questions about Maurice?

963
01:09:50,258 --> 01:09:52,260
She lookin' for a man name of Glenn.

964
01:09:52,302 --> 01:09:55,471
Did l ask you? Go on and do something with yourself, Moselle.

965
01:09:55,555 --> 01:09:59,517
Why don't you take your ass to Dot and Etta's and get us some shrimp or somethin'?

966
01:10:10,418 --> 01:10:11,618
You are a fight?

967
01:10:11,619 --> 01:10:12,619
How do you know that?

968
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:13,820
I can't tell.

969
01:10:14,221 --> 01:10:15,821
Yeah, I was.

970
01:10:17,369 --> 01:10:19,788
'Til l got my retina detached two times.

971
01:10:21,457 --> 01:10:25,419
- What'd you fight, about middleweight? - Nah, light.

972
01:10:25,461 --> 01:10:28,505
Super middleweight, once my body developed.

973
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,552
- What you go about, what, a bantam? - Flyweight.

974
01:10:33,636 --> 01:10:38,140
Nigger, what? You know your divisions, huh?

975
01:10:38,182 --> 01:10:41,476
Do you like the fights? You like the rough stuff?

976
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:44,354
Yeah, l bet you do.

977
01:10:44,438 --> 01:10:46,815
You like to get down and tussle a little bit?

978
01:10:46,899 --> 01:10:50,152
Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over.

979
01:10:50,236 --> 01:10:52,529
We used to get down on the floor and tussle all the time.

980
01:10:52,613 --> 01:10:58,452
l'd say to her, ''You a good bitch, Tuffy. Here's a treat for ya.''

981
01:10:58,494 --> 01:11:03,165
And l give Tuffy what all good bitches love best, and you know what that is?

982
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:08,837
Know what that is? A bone.

983
01:11:08,921 --> 01:11:11,173
l'll give you a good bone too, girl.

984
01:11:11,215 --> 01:11:13,175
You're not my type.

985
01:11:13,259 --> 01:11:15,928
No, that shit don't mean nothin' to me.

986
01:11:16,012 --> 01:11:19,640
- l let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants. - l gotta go, Kenneth.

987
01:11:19,682 --> 01:11:22,017
- Maybe we'll see each other again. - No, no, we gonna tussle first.

988
01:11:23,436 --> 01:11:25,604
Awww!

989
01:11:25,688 --> 01:11:28,524
Damn it! What the fuck was that?

990
01:11:28,608 --> 01:11:32,194
You wanted to tussle. We tussled.

991
01:11:33,488 --> 01:11:37,533
That's a big ass house.

992
01:11:37,617 --> 01:11:39,535
Place almost looks like a prison.

993
01:11:39,619 --> 01:11:41,912
No doubt he's got some serious security system.

994
01:11:41,996 --> 01:11:45,082
Time comes, we go up, knock on the door, see if he wants to talk about old times.

995
01:11:45,166 --> 01:11:47,877
- You know, the easy way. - Cool.

996
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:51,713
Think he'll let us in, we got the Snoop and that musclebound asshole with us?

997
01:11:51,798 --> 01:11:53,716
Nobody's gonna be with us.

998
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:56,511
l say we go to the fights tomorrow night, see what Snoopy's big plan is,

999
01:11:56,552 --> 01:11:59,972
then we go in, ahead of him, alone.

1000
01:12:00,056 --> 01:12:01,974
Oh, l can dig it.

1001
01:12:02,058 --> 01:12:04,769
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we off livin' the good life.

1002
01:12:04,852 --> 01:12:07,354
Good life. Buddy, you know anybody who's done one last big score...

1003
01:12:07,397 --> 01:12:09,357
and then gone on to live the good life?

1004
01:12:09,399 --> 01:12:12,568
Look, Jack, there's a chance we'll walk out of here with nothin'.

1005
01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:14,612
l say, let fate decide.

1006
01:12:14,696 --> 01:12:17,532
Let fate decide? What are you, the fuckin' Dalai Lama now?

1007
01:12:17,574 --> 01:12:19,534
Nah, man, it's my sister.

1008
01:12:19,576 --> 01:12:21,786
My sister believes in fate but not hell.

1009
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:23,913
That's why she stopped praying for all the lost souls,

1010
01:12:23,997 --> 01:12:26,165
since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore.

1011
01:12:26,249 --> 01:12:29,585
But every day, she asks her boss to pray that Buddy don't fuck up.

1012
01:12:29,669 --> 01:12:32,254
l mean, what do you think?

1013
01:12:32,338 --> 01:12:34,798
- Well-- - You think there's a hell?

1014
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:37,760
Yeah, it's called the Glades Correctional lnstitute.

1015
01:12:37,802 --> 01:12:40,221
l'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.

1016
01:12:40,263 --> 01:12:42,598
They put a gun on you, you'll go, brother.

1017
01:12:44,309 --> 01:12:47,312
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice.

1018
01:12:49,689 --> 01:12:53,693
So, Mr. Foley,

1019
01:12:53,777 --> 01:12:58,323
Mr. Ripley and l have had a long discussion about your role in the company,

1020
01:12:58,406 --> 01:13:00,991
and it was his feeling you'd be happiest working down here in Miami.

1021
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:03,661
- How's that sound to you? - Sounds great.

1022
01:13:03,745 --> 01:13:06,998
Good. You're about a 42 long, right?

1023
01:13:09,417 --> 01:13:13,212
l uh, l'm about a 42--

1024
01:13:13,296 --> 01:13:15,214
like, 42 regular.

1025
01:13:23,223 --> 01:13:25,433
- Okay, let's see how she fits. - What is that?

1026
01:13:25,475 --> 01:13:27,435
Your uniform.

1027
01:13:29,646 --> 01:13:31,564
My uniform.

1028
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:34,943
Mr. Foley. Mr. Foley!

1029
01:13:36,111 --> 01:13:38,279
Sir, sir. Excuse me, sir.

1030
01:13:38,321 --> 01:13:40,698
Sir! Sir, excuse me!

1031
01:13:40,782 --> 01:13:42,825
- You can't go in there! - Are you fucking kidding me? A security guard?

1032
01:13:42,909 --> 01:13:45,494
- What are you, stoned? - Hey, hey! Take it easy!

1033
01:13:45,579 --> 01:13:47,497
lt's all right, Peggy. lt's under control.

1034
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:52,168
You know something?

1035
01:13:52,252 --> 01:13:55,213
l wasn't sure that you'd show up here, but l was very sure if you did,

1036
01:13:55,297 --> 01:13:57,924
you'd throw this job in my face.

1037
01:13:58,008 --> 01:13:59,926
Let me tell you something.

1038
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:03,471
Every single thing you've done with your life up until this point...

1039
01:14:03,513 --> 01:14:05,973
in the real world means nothing.

1040
01:14:06,016 --> 01:14:07,976
Less than nothing.

1041
01:14:08,018 --> 01:14:10,103
You're a bank robber.

1042
01:14:10,187 --> 01:14:12,898
That's not a very marketable skill.

1043
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:15,692
We don't see a lot of old bank robbers walking around...

1044
01:14:15,776 --> 01:14:18,695
with a pension plan, now do we?

1045
01:14:18,779 --> 01:14:20,739
l think you know this. That's why you're here.

1046
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:23,534
Today, l've offered you...

1047
01:14:23,617 --> 01:14:26,870
a lousy job with a lousy wage.

1048
01:14:26,954 --> 01:14:31,041
You want something better? Why don't you show me you can change?

1049
01:14:31,125 --> 01:14:34,336
Then l'll offer you something better, a lot better.

1050
01:14:34,378 --> 01:14:37,881
But until then, my friend, you'll have to earn it.

1051
01:14:39,299 --> 01:14:41,217
How, Dick? The way you earn it?

1052
01:14:42,386 --> 01:14:44,388
Married some rich broad owns the company,

1053
01:14:44,471 --> 01:14:46,514
selling it off a piece at a time then divorcing her?

1054
01:14:46,557 --> 01:14:50,978
What's this Knute Rockne ''pull yourself up by the bootstraps'' bullshit?

1055
01:14:51,061 --> 01:14:54,230
Back in prison, a guy like you in a place like that?

1056
01:14:54,315 --> 01:14:57,609
You were ice cream for freaks. A goddamned dumpling.

1057
01:14:57,693 --> 01:15:01,196
Maurice and a dozen other guys would have bled you till you had nothing.

1058
01:15:01,238 --> 01:15:04,407
Until you were nothing. l saved your ass!

1059
01:15:04,491 --> 01:15:06,993
So you'll pardon me if l don't want to sit on a fucking stool all day,

1060
01:15:07,077 --> 01:15:10,246
and say, ''Sign in here, please,'' or ''Hey, pal, you can't park here.''

1061
01:15:10,331 --> 01:15:13,500
All right, Dick? l can't fuckin' do it, Dick!

1062
01:15:13,584 --> 01:15:15,544
- l'm disappointed in you. - You wanna--

1063
01:15:15,586 --> 01:15:18,171
Oh, here we go. What job did he promise you boys?

1064
01:15:18,255 --> 01:15:20,799
- There's two ways we can do this. - Yeah, what are they?

1065
01:16:05,386 --> 01:16:09,515
Hey, Buddy, l gotta get a better pair of shoes and some things for tomorrow.

1066
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:11,517
Drop me off by the Ren Center and we'll hook up later?

1067
01:16:11,601 --> 01:16:14,478
Yeah, okay.

1068
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:15,938
l better go call my sister.

1069
01:16:31,913 --> 01:16:34,498
Can l get you anything?

1070
01:16:34,582 --> 01:16:36,959
Yeah, l'll have a bourbon, please. Water back.

1071
01:16:37,001 --> 01:16:38,961
Okay.

1072
01:16:41,381 --> 01:16:44,509
Hey, Tad, why don't you do us again, please?

1073
01:16:44,592 --> 01:16:47,803
Oh, and, Celeste, put the lady's drink on our bill.

1074
01:16:59,023 --> 01:17:02,276
- They want to buy your drink for you. - Yeah, l get that.

1075
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,695
- Tell them l'd rather pay for my own. - Okay.

1076
01:17:09,492 --> 01:17:11,410
l'll find out.

1077
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,042
Excuse me.

1078
01:17:17,125 --> 01:17:19,585
My associates and l, we made a little bet...

1079
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:21,629
on what you do for a living.

1080
01:17:21,713 --> 01:17:24,674
And l won. Hi. l'm Phillip.

1081
01:17:24,716 --> 01:17:28,428
lf it's okay with you, Phillip, l'd rather just have a quiet drink and leave.

1082
01:17:28,511 --> 01:17:32,389
Don't you want to know what l guessed? How l know what you do for a living?

1083
01:17:32,474 --> 01:17:35,602
Really, Phillip, l don't want to be rude. l just want to be left alone.

1084
01:17:42,192 --> 01:17:44,611
lt's a little cold over there.

1085
01:17:51,117 --> 01:17:53,619
Excuse me. l think l know why you're depressed.

1086
01:17:53,703 --> 01:17:56,914
lf l can offer my observation.

1087
01:17:58,083 --> 01:18:01,252
See, l got a hunch you're the new sales rep,

1088
01:18:01,336 --> 01:18:06,549
and the client's not exactly knocked out by the fact that a young lady--

1089
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:10,886
even one as stunning as yourself-- is handling the account.

1090
01:18:10,929 --> 01:18:13,848
Am l close?

1091
01:18:13,932 --> 01:18:15,850
l'm Andy.

1092
01:18:17,561 --> 01:18:23,191
We're all ad guys. Flew in this morning from the apple-- New York.

1093
01:18:23,225 --> 01:18:26,019
Came in to pitch Hiram Walker Distillery.

1094
01:18:26,061 --> 01:18:29,105
Little test market campaign for the new margarita mix.

1095
01:18:29,189 --> 01:18:33,318
lt's really pretty interesting. We take this, um,

1096
01:18:33,402 --> 01:18:35,946
Mex-- um, Hispanic bandito...

1097
01:18:36,029 --> 01:18:39,574
with his bullet belts and everything, and the big Chihuahua hat,

1098
01:18:39,658 --> 01:18:42,452
and he pulls out his six-guns,

1099
01:18:42,536 --> 01:18:46,081
- and these guys back here-- - Andy.

1100
01:18:46,123 --> 01:18:48,250
Really. Who gives a shit?

1101
01:18:48,333 --> 01:18:53,254
- Do you want to tell me what happened? - Beat it, Andy.

1102
01:19:02,056 --> 01:19:03,974
Andy.

1103
01:19:04,058 --> 01:19:05,976
What'd you do?

1104
01:19:17,947 --> 01:19:22,034
- Can l buy you a drink? - Yeah, l'd love one.

1105
01:19:24,119 --> 01:19:26,496
Sit down.

1106
01:19:39,051 --> 01:19:40,969
l'm Gary.

1107
01:19:42,596 --> 01:19:44,514
l'm Celeste.

1108
01:19:46,976 --> 01:19:49,895
- lt takes forever to get a drink. There's only one waitress. - l can go to the bar.

1109
01:19:49,979 --> 01:19:52,314
- Oh, don't go. - Are those guys bothering you?

1110
01:19:52,398 --> 01:19:54,358
No, they're fine. l mean, you just got here.

1111
01:19:58,821 --> 01:20:00,781
Here, help yourself.

1112
01:20:02,658 --> 01:20:05,202
- You like bourbon? - l love it.

1113
01:20:05,286 --> 01:20:08,706
We got that out of the way. Tell me, Celeste, what do you do for a living?

1114
01:20:08,789 --> 01:20:12,375
l'm a sales rep, and l came here to call on a customer,

1115
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:14,587
but they gave me a hard time 'cause l'm a girl.

1116
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:16,588
ls that how you think of yourself?

1117
01:20:16,672 --> 01:20:18,590
- As a sales rep? - As a girl.

1118
01:20:18,674 --> 01:20:20,676
- Yeah, l don't have a problem with it. - l like your hair.

1119
01:20:20,718 --> 01:20:24,680
- l like your outfit. - Actually, this is my second favorite outfit.

1120
01:20:24,764 --> 01:20:28,100
l had a first favorite, but it got ruined and l had to get rid of it.

1121
01:20:28,184 --> 01:20:30,102
- You did? - lt smelled.

1122
01:20:30,186 --> 01:20:32,688
- Really? Having it cleaned didn't help? - No.

1123
01:20:32,772 --> 01:20:34,690
So tell me, Gary, what do you do for a living?

1124
01:20:34,774 --> 01:20:37,777
- How far do you want to go with this? - Don't say anything yet.

1125
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:40,237
l don't think it works if we're somebody else.

1126
01:20:40,321 --> 01:20:42,239
l mean, Gary and Celeste, what do they know about anything?

1127
01:20:42,323 --> 01:20:44,867
- Well, this is your game, l've never played before. - lt's not a game.

1128
01:20:44,951 --> 01:20:47,119
lt's not something you play.

1129
01:20:47,203 --> 01:20:49,205
Well, does this make any sense to you?

1130
01:20:49,247 --> 01:20:51,582
lt doesn't have to. lt's something that happens.

1131
01:20:51,666 --> 01:20:56,712
lt's like seeing someone for the first time-- like you could be passing on the street,

1132
01:20:56,796 --> 01:21:00,049
and you look at each other and for a few seconds...

1133
01:21:00,133 --> 01:21:03,553
there's this kind of a recognition-- like you both know something.

1134
01:21:03,636 --> 01:21:06,513
The next moment, the person's gone,

1135
01:21:06,556 --> 01:21:09,976
and it's too late to do anything about it.

1136
01:21:10,059 --> 01:21:12,895
And you always remember it, because it was there, and you let it go,

1137
01:21:12,937 --> 01:21:16,315
and you think to yourself, ''What if l had stopped? lf l had said something?''

1138
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:18,317
''What if?''

1139
01:21:18,401 --> 01:21:20,361
''What if?''

1140
01:21:20,403 --> 01:21:24,490
And it may only happen a few times in your life.

1141
01:21:26,743 --> 01:21:30,121
- Or once. - Or once.

1142
01:22:06,283 --> 01:22:08,827
How'd you find me?

1143
01:22:08,910 --> 01:22:10,828
Uh--

1144
01:22:12,622 --> 01:22:14,915
Called your room from downstairs.

1145
01:22:14,958 --> 01:22:17,418
Oh.

1146
01:22:18,754 --> 01:22:20,756
And if l had answered, what were you gonna say?

1147
01:22:20,797 --> 01:22:25,176
l would say who l was, and do you remember me, and want to meet for a drink?

1148
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:30,181
lf l remembered you. l came here looking for you.

1149
01:22:30,265 --> 01:22:33,017
All right, so then l would have said yes, but for all you know,

1150
01:22:33,101 --> 01:22:35,520
l could have had a SWAT team waiting for you-- why would you trust me?

1151
01:22:35,604 --> 01:22:37,606
lt'd be worth the risk.

1152
01:22:37,648 --> 01:22:40,192
- You like taking risks. - So do you.

1153
01:22:42,486 --> 01:22:44,821
You know, sooner or later--

1154
01:22:48,408 --> 01:22:51,744
You really wear that suit.

1155
01:22:51,828 --> 01:22:54,372
Well, that's not what you were about to say.

1156
01:22:54,456 --> 01:22:57,333
- Remember how talkative you were in the trunk? - Mm-hmm.

1157
01:22:57,417 --> 01:23:00,294
- Adele said you do that when you're nervous. - Oh, she did, did she?

1158
01:23:01,839 --> 01:23:05,926
-You kept touching me, feeling my thigh. -But in a nice way.

1159
01:23:25,195 --> 01:23:28,239
You know, that Sig you took from me was special.

1160
01:23:28,324 --> 01:23:30,284
My dad gave it to me for my birthday.

1161
01:23:30,367 --> 01:23:32,243
Yeah?

1162
01:23:32,328 --> 01:23:34,413
What were you going to do with me?

1163
01:23:34,496 --> 01:23:37,040
l hadn't really worked that part out yet.

1164
01:23:37,082 --> 01:23:39,292
All l knew is that l liked you, and that l didn't wanna...

1165
01:23:39,376 --> 01:23:41,544
leave you there on the side of the road and never see you again.

1166
01:23:43,214 --> 01:23:45,174
Then you waved to me in that elevator.

1167
01:23:45,216 --> 01:23:48,135
Yeah, l wasn't sure if you caught that.

1168
01:23:48,219 --> 01:23:51,222
l couldn't believe it. By that time l had been...

1169
01:23:51,305 --> 01:23:53,557
thinking about you a lot...

1170
01:23:53,599 --> 01:23:57,060
and just wondering what it would be like if we met,

1171
01:23:57,144 --> 01:24:00,188
if we could take a time-out.

1172
01:24:00,231 --> 01:24:02,608
l was thinking the same thing.

1173
01:24:02,691 --> 01:24:05,568
l kept thinking, ''What if we took a time-out?''

1174
01:24:05,611 --> 01:24:09,489
lf we... just spent some time together.

1175
01:24:14,328 --> 01:24:16,246
- You know, l saw you on the street. - Where?

1176
01:24:16,330 --> 01:24:18,832
Outside Adele's.

1177
01:24:18,916 --> 01:24:21,752
- You went to see her? - To warn her about Chino.

1178
01:24:21,836 --> 01:24:25,089
- So she did help you. - l don't think we should get into that.

1179
01:24:25,131 --> 01:24:27,216
You're right. And l won't ask about Buddy,

1180
01:24:27,258 --> 01:24:32,805
or what you guys are doing in Detroit, or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet--

1181
01:24:32,888 --> 01:24:35,724
Okay, now, don't talk like that, because you scare me.

1182
01:24:47,403 --> 01:24:50,364
- Let's get out of here. - Yeah.

1183
01:25:44,711 --> 01:25:47,338
There's something l want you to know.

1184
01:25:47,422 --> 01:25:49,674
l wasn't just looking for a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.

1185
01:25:49,758 --> 01:25:52,385
- Or, l was-- - Why are you mad?

1186
01:25:52,469 --> 01:25:56,055
l was looking for some kinky thrill-- you know, score with the bank robber.

1187
01:25:56,139 --> 01:25:58,891
-The way some women go for rough trade-- -All right.

1188
01:25:58,975 --> 01:26:02,979
Now l can say that l fucked a U.S. marshal. Do you think l will?

1189
01:26:03,021 --> 01:26:05,273
l don't know.

1190
01:26:05,357 --> 01:26:07,275
Mm-hmm.

1191
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:10,820
Come here.

1192
01:26:23,208 --> 01:26:25,668
l know a guy...

1193
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:28,838
walks into a bank with a bottle, tells everybody it's nitroglycerine.

1194
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,507
He scores some cash off of the teller.

1195
01:26:31,550 --> 01:26:34,886
On his way out, he drops the bottle. lt cracks on the floor.

1196
01:26:34,928 --> 01:26:38,556
He slips in it. He smacks up his head. They get him.

1197
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:42,352
The nitroglycerine was canola oil.

1198
01:26:42,394 --> 01:26:46,147
l know more fucked-up bank robbers than ones that know what they're doing.

1199
01:26:46,231 --> 01:26:50,401
l doubt one in ten could tell you where the dye pack is.

1200
01:26:50,444 --> 01:26:52,988
Most bank robbers are fucking morons.

1201
01:26:53,071 --> 01:26:57,492
For you to go to bed with one for kinky thrills,

1202
01:26:57,576 --> 01:27:00,912
like you were saying, makes you as dumb as they are.

1203
01:27:00,954 --> 01:27:02,914
Now, you are not dumb.

1204
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:09,463
Why would you think that? Why would you think that l would think that?

1205
01:27:12,674 --> 01:27:14,634
You're not dumb.

1206
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:18,638
Well, l don't know about that.

1207
01:27:18,722 --> 01:27:21,808
l mean, you can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.

1208
01:27:23,268 --> 01:27:25,228
Come here.

1209
01:27:42,871 --> 01:27:45,081
You're getting serious on me now.

1210
01:27:48,127 --> 01:27:50,295
Tryin' not to.

1211
01:27:53,382 --> 01:27:55,801
l just want to know what's gonna happen.

1212
01:28:02,933 --> 01:28:04,851
You know.

1213
01:28:54,694 --> 01:28:57,029
Put it together now. Put it together! Upstairs and downstairs.

1214
01:28:57,113 --> 01:29:00,074
- He don't want to see you downstairs! - Man, you drink like a bitch!

1215
01:29:01,867 --> 01:29:04,411
He don't want to see you-- Get your tussle on. Joe, get your tussle on!

1216
01:29:04,495 --> 01:29:06,830
Yeah, don't let him out that corner.

1217
01:29:06,873 --> 01:29:09,083
Don't let him out, now.

1218
01:29:11,711 --> 01:29:15,172
Hey, you know what? l gotta go take a pee.

1219
01:29:15,214 --> 01:29:19,134
What are you tellin' us for? You want somebody to hold your pecker?

1220
01:29:20,386 --> 01:29:22,554
Do that work, Joe!

1221
01:29:22,638 --> 01:29:24,556
Put it together now, Joe!

1222
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:27,184
That's it, baby!

1223
01:29:27,226 --> 01:29:30,896
Take him deep! Oh, oh, my God, l love it.

1224
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:33,148
Put him to sleep, Joe! Put him to sleep, Joe!

1225
01:29:33,232 --> 01:29:36,068
Sit down, Kenny. That's it! That's it!

1226
01:30:14,065 --> 01:30:16,734
- You tryin' to steal this car, Glenn? - Don't, don't, don't!

1227
01:30:18,445 --> 01:30:20,363
Oh, my God, l can't believe this!

1228
01:30:20,447 --> 01:30:24,659
Another one of those days, huh? Nothing seems to be going right.

1229
01:30:24,743 --> 01:30:26,745
- l don't have the keys to the car. - l see that.

1230
01:30:26,786 --> 01:30:29,663
No, l mean l am not fucking stealing the car!

1231
01:30:29,748 --> 01:30:33,752
- You're not? - No, l already stole it a week ago,

1232
01:30:33,793 --> 01:30:36,253
whenever it was, in West Palm.

1233
01:30:36,296 --> 01:30:38,298
So l can't be stealing it again, can l?

1234
01:30:38,381 --> 01:30:41,092
- Put your hands on the wheel, please. - Okay, so now you're gonna...

1235
01:30:41,134 --> 01:30:43,511
bust me for pickin' up a car, what the--

1236
01:30:43,595 --> 01:30:46,097
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape,

1237
01:30:46,139 --> 01:30:49,308
and for conspiring to do whatever you came here for.

1238
01:30:49,392 --> 01:30:52,353
Listen to me. These guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me,

1239
01:30:52,437 --> 01:30:55,731
and they're fucking animals, man.

1240
01:30:57,984 --> 01:31:00,152
What's going on, Glenn?

1241
01:31:00,195 --> 01:31:02,864
Nothing. l just wanna get the fuck outta here.

1242
01:31:02,948 --> 01:31:05,325
l thought this whole thing was your idea.

1243
01:31:05,408 --> 01:31:07,493
Okay, ripping off Ripley was my idea,

1244
01:31:07,577 --> 01:31:11,330
but these guys, they are in a whole other level of their own.

1245
01:31:11,373 --> 01:31:14,459
- Ripley, the Wall Street guy? - Yeah, the plan was...

1246
01:31:14,501 --> 01:31:16,503
to pick him up at his office tomorrow...

1247
01:31:16,545 --> 01:31:19,464
and drive him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.

1248
01:31:19,506 --> 01:31:23,009
And now l don't give a shit what the guys do, you know?

1249
01:31:23,051 --> 01:31:26,554
- And Foley was part of this. - Yeah, he's supposed to be, but he hasn't showed up yet,

1250
01:31:26,638 --> 01:31:28,806
- which is good for him. - Why?

1251
01:31:28,849 --> 01:31:32,602
Because Maurice is gonna kill him.

1252
01:31:32,686 --> 01:31:35,605
Like, try to collect the reward money or something.

1253
01:31:35,689 --> 01:31:38,650
But you say he hasn't shown up yet. You think he backed out?

1254
01:31:38,692 --> 01:31:41,695
l don't know. He doesn't exactly confide in me.

1255
01:31:42,738 --> 01:31:44,865
l wonder why.

1256
01:31:44,907 --> 01:31:48,452
Okay, if you're gonna do this, let's do it and get out of here.

1257
01:31:48,535 --> 01:31:50,954
l am freezing my ass off!

1258
01:31:51,038 --> 01:31:53,540
lf you wanna get out of here, run. lt'll warm you up.

1259
01:31:53,582 --> 01:31:55,542
Oh, ha, ha.

1260
01:32:00,756 --> 01:32:03,467
Really?

1261
01:32:03,550 --> 01:32:07,011
l swear to God, Glenn, if l find out that you are lying to me, l--

1262
01:32:07,054 --> 01:32:09,056
l know, you will find me. l believe it.

1263
01:32:14,728 --> 01:32:17,897
Hey, know what l was thinkin'?

1264
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:20,901
lf you didn't drive me to the federal court last summer,

1265
01:32:20,985 --> 01:32:22,903
you wouldn't even know who l am.

1266
01:32:22,987 --> 01:32:28,075
lf l didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.

1267
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:30,743
Think of it that way. Now run.

1268
01:32:38,586 --> 01:32:40,504
Yeah! Yeah!

1269
01:32:43,090 --> 01:32:46,259
l'm tellin' you, man, the money is here.

1270
01:32:46,302 --> 01:32:49,555
- Snoop. - Hey, it's the bank robbers.

1271
01:32:49,597 --> 01:32:51,599
Y'all missin' the fights, man. Pull up a chair.

1272
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:54,100
- Who's sittin' here? - Oh, that's your homey, Glenn, man.

1273
01:32:54,185 --> 01:32:56,103
But he bounced to the bathroom a couple minutes ago...

1274
01:32:56,187 --> 01:32:58,272
- and we ain't seen him since. - Must've fell in, man.

1275
01:32:58,314 --> 01:33:00,274
No doubt.

1276
01:33:00,357 --> 01:33:02,859
Yeah, sent these two looking for him. They came back shaking their heads.

1277
01:33:04,361 --> 01:33:06,946
Well, if he left his coat and he's been gone a while, then--

1278
01:33:07,031 --> 01:33:09,116
- Car's here, man. l checked. - Yeah.

1279
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:12,453
- All right. We're leavin'. - Leavin'?

1280
01:33:12,536 --> 01:33:14,538
- What the fuck, Foley? - Stupid, you know where Glenn is.

1281
01:33:14,622 --> 01:33:17,750
- Look, what you worried about Glenn for, what he know? - l thought everything.

1282
01:33:17,792 --> 01:33:20,961
No, Glenn know everything that's supposed to happen tomorrow.

1283
01:33:21,003 --> 01:33:24,631
Now, he may run and tell somebody that, but that don't mean shit.

1284
01:33:24,674 --> 01:33:27,301
Glenn don't know l changed the plan.

1285
01:33:27,343 --> 01:33:30,304
lt's happenin' tonight. Soon as we leave here.

1286
01:33:30,388 --> 01:33:33,641
Go back by the house, pick up some shit we gonna need, and we just gonna do it.

1287
01:33:39,647 --> 01:33:43,317
- Give me a minute to talk to Buddy. - You got two minutes, that's all.

1288
01:33:43,359 --> 01:33:45,986
- Make up your mind, Foley. - l wasn't asking permission.

1289
01:33:55,830 --> 01:33:59,124
- You know they're gonna set us up. - l get that feeling, yeah.

1290
01:33:59,167 --> 01:34:01,627
You think you can get to the diamonds before they do?

1291
01:34:03,713 --> 01:34:07,383
l'll make you a deal. You get outta here right now.

1292
01:34:07,467 --> 01:34:10,803
l'll do the job with Snoop. l'll meet you anywhere you want, give you half.

1293
01:34:10,845 --> 01:34:14,682
-Half for doin' what? -Gettin' me out of Glades, for starters.

1294
01:34:15,934 --> 01:34:18,478
Who's gonna watch your back?

1295
01:36:01,498 --> 01:36:03,875
All right, White Boy. House call.

1296
01:36:15,888 --> 01:36:18,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1297
01:36:26,064 --> 01:36:28,483
- Ready to do this, baby? - Ready for whatever.

1298
01:36:28,567 --> 01:36:31,486
Cool. My shit always work.

1299
01:36:33,155 --> 01:36:35,907
Perennial Plumbing.

1300
01:36:37,159 --> 01:36:39,953
Somebody in the house called.

1301
01:36:39,995 --> 01:36:43,415
You don't know what you're talking about, because no one was here.

1302
01:36:43,499 --> 01:36:46,001
- Let's go skiing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1303
01:36:49,713 --> 01:36:51,673
You still got time to take me up on my offer.

1304
01:36:51,715 --> 01:36:54,342
And leave you alone with these assholes?

1305
01:36:56,512 --> 01:37:00,390
- Raymond Cruz. - Ray, it's Karen Sisco. l'm at Ripley's house.

1306
01:37:00,474 --> 01:37:03,101
l just saw Maurice Miller and four other suspects force their way into the house.

1307
01:37:03,185 --> 01:37:05,103
They're armed. l'm gonna need backup.

1308
01:37:05,646 --> 01:37:07,522
- Who are you? - l work here.

1309
01:37:07,606 --> 01:37:09,691
l'm the maid. Fuck off!

1310
01:37:09,775 --> 01:37:12,986
- That's exactly what l'm gonna do: fuck you, then off you. - Hey, not yet.

1311
01:37:13,028 --> 01:37:16,489
- Where Ripley at? - He isn't here.

1312
01:37:16,532 --> 01:37:21,119
- Out for the evening or some shit? - He's in Florida-- Palm Beach.

1313
01:37:21,203 --> 01:37:24,998
- When's he due back? - What difference does it make? You gonna wait for him?

1314
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:29,627
Mr. Ripley's down for the season. Christmas to Easter.

1315
01:37:29,712 --> 01:37:32,715
Stop that shit, man.

1316
01:37:32,757 --> 01:37:34,925
You're here all by yourself?

1317
01:37:35,009 --> 01:37:37,386
That's right. Just me.

1318
01:37:42,725 --> 01:37:45,853
- Where Ripley's safe at, keeps his valuables in? - l don't have any idea.

1319
01:37:45,895 --> 01:37:49,440
l fuckin' bet you don't.

1320
01:37:49,523 --> 01:37:52,817
We gonna take a look upstairs in the man's bedroom, all right?

1321
01:37:52,902 --> 01:37:55,946
You and Mr. Buddy look at all the rooms down here.

1322
01:37:56,030 --> 01:37:57,948
Check the paintings, behind the walls.

1323
01:37:58,032 --> 01:38:01,452
Check the fuckin' walls in the closets. The man's got a safe. lt's here somewhere.

1324
01:38:01,536 --> 01:38:03,538
What about his place down in Florida?

1325
01:38:03,579 --> 01:38:06,873
lf you called, we could have checked the walls down there before we left.

1326
01:38:06,916 --> 01:38:10,377
That is, if you'd bothered to find out where he was. You follow me?

1327
01:38:11,921 --> 01:38:14,340
Man, take this bitch upstairs.

1328
01:38:14,423 --> 01:38:17,384
Upstairs!

1329
01:38:19,470 --> 01:38:22,097
Listen, you try and trip any alarms, anything like that,

1330
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:25,101
you gonna be a dead Hazel, you understand me?

1331
01:38:27,103 --> 01:38:29,688
- Hey, hey, where we at? Where is it? - Over there.

1332
01:38:29,772 --> 01:38:33,984
- Ever wear one of these? - l don't ski.

1333
01:38:34,068 --> 01:38:37,446
Keep an eye on the maid. l'll have a look around.

1334
01:38:42,076 --> 01:38:44,787
Go sit down. Please.

1335
01:38:49,876 --> 01:38:54,630
Damn, Mo. How's this motherfucker livin', man? Shit!

1336
01:38:54,672 --> 01:38:57,758
Check behind the pictures on the walls, man.

1337
01:39:01,179 --> 01:39:03,264
Hey, Mo. Found some rubbers.

1338
01:39:03,306 --> 01:39:06,142
White Boy, why the fuck you lookin' under the mattress?

1339
01:39:06,184 --> 01:39:08,936
You know dude ain't gonna hide no diamonds under there.

1340
01:39:08,978 --> 01:39:11,480
Damn! Dumb 'bama motherfucker.

1341
01:39:11,523 --> 01:39:16,319
- Where Foley at, man? - He's checkin' the other rooms like you said, boss.

1342
01:39:16,403 --> 01:39:20,657
Man, keep a eye on Foley.

1343
01:39:29,666 --> 01:39:33,127
Ken, stop fuckin' with the radio. Put on a CD.

1344
01:39:33,169 --> 01:39:36,797
- l don't recognize none of these bands, Mo. - Just pick somebody.

1345
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:39,092
What, ''How To Sing Like Michael Bolton''?

1346
01:39:42,345 --> 01:39:44,930
What the fuck you wanna listen to, huh?

1347
01:39:45,015 --> 01:39:49,519
- l like Schubert. - Schubert? Well, l don't.

1348
01:39:53,648 --> 01:39:55,941
Uh, Foley?

1349
01:40:05,368 --> 01:40:07,328
Cool.

1350
01:41:07,765 --> 01:41:09,725
911 got you on hold, Richard?

1351
01:41:11,352 --> 01:41:13,270
- Foley! - How you doin'?

1352
01:41:13,354 --> 01:41:15,564
What in God's name is happening here?

1353
01:41:15,606 --> 01:41:18,442
- Who's upstairs? - Snoopy Miller, couple of his friends.

1354
01:41:18,525 --> 01:41:21,611
- Maurice, from Lompoc? - Yup.

1355
01:41:21,654 --> 01:41:23,614
Have they got Midge up there?

1356
01:41:23,656 --> 01:41:26,283
What kind of a man lets a woman answer the door this time of night?

1357
01:41:26,367 --> 01:41:29,995
We thought it was her husband. He comes here and checks up on her.

1358
01:41:30,079 --> 01:41:32,039
l'm supposed to be down in Florida.

1359
01:41:32,122 --> 01:41:34,541
ln a few minutes, you're gonna wish you were. Let's go, come on.

1360
01:41:34,625 --> 01:41:36,752
Why don't you sit down? We'll have a look at your fish.

1361
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:44,885
Oh, that's workin'. That's workin'.

1362
01:41:50,641 --> 01:41:53,477
Motherfucker! l found the safe, yo!

1363
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:57,940
Don't go nowhere.

1364
01:42:00,651 --> 01:42:05,155
- Oh, shit! We gonna have a party! - Look at that bitch.

1365
01:42:16,751 --> 01:42:18,377
They found the safe.

1366
01:42:18,461 --> 01:42:21,130
- Fuck. - Buddy, you remember Richard, don't you?

1367
01:42:21,213 --> 01:42:24,758
- Yeah, hi. Nice house. - Thank you.

1368
01:42:27,345 --> 01:42:29,638
Yeah, man. We just all hit this handle,

1369
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:31,640
blow this sucker wide open, man.

1370
01:42:31,682 --> 01:42:34,393
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's get ready.

1371
01:42:34,477 --> 01:42:37,146
Oh, Dude-- you're gonna kill me with that.

1372
01:42:40,983 --> 01:42:43,652
- Where you been, man? - Found some steaks.

1373
01:42:43,736 --> 01:42:46,613
- Steaks? - Yeah, some big ones, bro.

1374
01:42:46,656 --> 01:42:48,699
Man, come on. Blast this damn safe open, man.

1375
01:42:48,783 --> 01:42:52,745
- He's down there lookin' for food. - Fool.

1376
01:42:52,829 --> 01:42:58,292
All right. Hold it. No. Get to the side, man. All right.

1377
01:42:58,334 --> 01:43:01,962
On three. One, two, three.

1378
01:43:04,340 --> 01:43:07,384
- Jesus Christ, they're shooting Midge! - Sit down, Dick.

1379
01:43:07,468 --> 01:43:09,511
They're trying to open up the safe, not your maid.

1380
01:43:09,596 --> 01:43:14,392
Oh, shit.

1381
01:43:14,475 --> 01:43:16,393
Man, we didn't even crack this sum' bitch.

1382
01:43:27,030 --> 01:43:29,490
- Okay, hit the hinges. - Uh-huh.

1383
01:43:29,532 --> 01:43:32,368
Put your finger in your ear, man. This is gonna be loud.

1384
01:43:32,410 --> 01:43:35,371
All right, on three. One, two--

1385
01:43:35,455 --> 01:43:40,418
The combination is 3-10-44.

1386
01:43:42,629 --> 01:43:46,341
- Richard's birthday. - Thank you.

1387
01:44:05,485 --> 01:44:07,653
Are they dead?

1388
01:44:09,614 --> 01:44:11,532
We gotta find Foley, man.

1389
01:44:11,825 --> 01:44:14,619
Can't believe you're still angry with me after all this time.

1390
01:44:14,661 --> 01:44:17,580
l'm not angry with you, Richard. ln fact, l'm completely relaxed.

1391
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:21,751
The thing is, l can't figure if it's the fish that are cooling me out,

1392
01:44:21,835 --> 01:44:25,922
or all those uncut diamonds in the bottom of the tank, there.

1393
01:44:32,596 --> 01:44:34,514
Goddamn.

1394
01:44:34,598 --> 01:44:37,267
Dumb-fuck Glenn was right. You got about 5 million worth in there?

1395
01:44:37,350 --> 01:44:39,268
Five point two.

1396
01:44:40,979 --> 01:44:43,272
They just look like plain ol' rocks!

1397
01:44:43,357 --> 01:44:45,817
They sure do. You wanna grab 'em, Buddy?

1398
01:44:52,366 --> 01:44:55,869
lf l were you, l'd get up and run.

1399
01:44:55,953 --> 01:44:59,122
- l'm not leaving Midge. - Don't be an asshole. They're gonna kill you.

1400
01:44:59,206 --> 01:45:03,210
Well, if that's my fate then so be it, but l'm not leaving her. l'm in love with her.

1401
01:45:06,213 --> 01:45:09,716
- Come on, Jack. - Good luck, Richard.

1402
01:45:26,066 --> 01:45:29,611
- Come on, Jack. - Shit. They're gonna rape that maid, aren't they?

1403
01:45:29,695 --> 01:45:32,364
By the look of those guys, they'll rip her too.

1404
01:45:32,406 --> 01:45:34,366
- Then they're gonna kill 'em. - At least.

1405
01:45:36,869 --> 01:45:38,787
Rip, Rip.

1406
01:45:38,871 --> 01:45:41,498
- Tricky motherfucker. - Are those my suits?

1407
01:45:41,582 --> 01:45:45,502
Naw. These are my suits. Look at you, man.

1408
01:45:46,420 --> 01:45:48,380
Where you been hidin', Dick?

1409
01:45:49,715 --> 01:45:51,633
We made it, didn't we?

1410
01:45:51,717 --> 01:45:54,928
- All you gotta do is get in the van, baby. - l'm goin' back in.

1411
01:45:54,970 --> 01:45:58,390
- l'm goin' with you. - No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport.

1412
01:45:58,432 --> 01:46:00,600
- l'll get one of Ripley's cars. - Jack--

1413
01:46:00,684 --> 01:46:04,979
The shit that's about to go down here, you'll be on the phone with your sister for a month.

1414
01:46:05,064 --> 01:46:09,485
- All l'm sayin' is we're square. - Here.

1415
01:46:09,568 --> 01:46:11,945
Yep.

1416
01:46:12,029 --> 01:46:13,947
Jack.

1417
01:46:21,288 --> 01:46:23,206
Get outta here.

1418
01:46:41,976 --> 01:46:45,396
- Get that shit off. - Get your hands off me!

1419
01:46:45,479 --> 01:46:48,356
Fuck you, shut up! Nobody's gonna help you.

1420
01:46:49,901 --> 01:46:53,487
- Midge! - Fuck Midge, man. Where the jewels at, Dick?

1421
01:46:53,571 --> 01:46:57,324
- Foley-- Foley's got them. Go after Foley! - Where the fuck is Foley, man?

1422
01:47:04,499 --> 01:47:06,417
Midge?

1423
01:47:12,465 --> 01:47:14,800
- Midge! - Sit your punk ass down, man.

1424
01:47:16,010 --> 01:47:18,554
- Ooh, goddamn! - Son of a bitch!

1425
01:47:18,638 --> 01:47:22,016
Man, take the front stairs. l'm gonna take the back.

1426
01:47:24,769 --> 01:47:27,605
- You all right? - Where's Richard?

1427
01:47:27,689 --> 01:47:31,359
He's downstairs. You wait here.

1428
01:47:36,364 --> 01:47:40,076
Hold it, asshole. Drop the gun.

1429
01:47:41,369 --> 01:47:43,287
Drop it!

1430
01:47:43,371 --> 01:47:45,414
Put the damn gun down, now.

1431
01:47:46,583 --> 01:47:49,377
Now!

1432
01:47:49,419 --> 01:47:52,547
Put it down!

1433
01:47:55,717 --> 01:47:58,845
Stay right there. Don't move. Maurice!

1434
01:47:58,887 --> 01:48:00,847
l got Foley!

1435
01:48:03,349 --> 01:48:05,267
Maurice!

1436
01:48:35,757 --> 01:48:38,509
Ain't got another clip l can use, do you?

1437
01:48:38,593 --> 01:48:40,886
No, l don't.

1438
01:48:43,431 --> 01:48:46,934
- You ain't never shot a gun before, have you? - Not until recently, no.

1439
01:48:47,018 --> 01:48:49,437
- You a little nervous? - Little bit, yeah.

1440
01:48:49,521 --> 01:48:54,108
You know, a situation like this has a high potentiality...

1441
01:48:54,192 --> 01:48:56,110
for the common motherfucker to bitch out.

1442
01:48:56,194 --> 01:48:58,946
So l figure, why take a chance?

1443
01:49:00,866 --> 01:49:02,784
Bitch!

1444
01:49:05,370 --> 01:49:07,288
- Aw, sh--! - Motherfucker!

1445
01:49:42,616 --> 01:49:44,659
Stop! Put your hands in the air!

1446
01:50:01,343 --> 01:50:03,261
Jack?

1447
01:50:04,722 --> 01:50:07,933
- l know you're up there. - Shit!

1448
01:50:11,312 --> 01:50:13,981
- Where's Kenneth? - He's up here.

1449
01:50:16,275 --> 01:50:18,610
He's dead.

1450
01:50:39,882 --> 01:50:43,594
- Come on, Jack, don't. - Pretend it's not me.

1451
01:50:43,677 --> 01:50:46,805
- You think l'd shoot you? - lf you don't, somebody else will.

1452
01:50:46,889 --> 01:50:50,559
What're you now? A desperado?

1453
01:50:50,601 --> 01:50:54,688
- Put the gun down. - l'm not goin' back.

1454
01:50:56,732 --> 01:51:00,944
Jack, please, don't make me do this. Put the gun down.

1455
01:51:03,739 --> 01:51:08,744
Damn it, Jack, put the gun down!

1456
01:51:08,828 --> 01:51:10,746
No more time-outs.

1457
01:51:20,047 --> 01:51:22,758
You win, Jack.

1458
01:51:31,267 --> 01:51:34,728
- l can't shoot you. - You did. You shot me.

1459
01:51:34,771 --> 01:51:37,023
You know what l mean.

1460
01:51:50,536 --> 01:51:55,123
l'm sorry. l wish things were different.

1461
01:52:38,251 --> 01:52:40,169
Airport.

1462
01:53:07,322 --> 01:53:11,117
Yeah, they don't know yet if they want to bring him up on the homicides.

1463
01:53:11,201 --> 01:53:14,037
l doubt if they will. They'll just put a detainer on him.

1464
01:53:14,079 --> 01:53:17,040
When they're through with him here, he'll go back to Florida.

1465
01:53:17,124 --> 01:53:19,459
Are you gonna go get him?

1466
01:53:19,543 --> 01:53:21,753
lt's possible. Why?

1467
01:53:21,837 --> 01:53:23,755
Well, you know, l was just thinkin'.

1468
01:53:23,839 --> 01:53:25,757
You can have a nice time with him on the ride down,

1469
01:53:25,841 --> 01:53:28,844
picking up where your interlude or whatever you call it left off,

1470
01:53:28,885 --> 01:53:31,721
and then you can throw him in the shithouse.

1471
01:53:33,223 --> 01:53:35,475
He knew what he was doing.

1472
01:53:35,559 --> 01:53:38,436
Nobody forced him to rob banks.

1473
01:53:39,730 --> 01:53:43,567
My little girl-- the tough babe.

1474
01:53:43,608 --> 01:53:45,568
l'll call you later.

1475
01:53:45,611 --> 01:53:47,779
Good-bye.

1476
01:54:05,172 --> 01:54:07,424
Jack.

1477
01:54:10,010 --> 01:54:11,928
l got you a present.

1478
01:54:14,723 --> 01:54:16,766
Something for the road.

1479
01:54:28,737 --> 01:54:33,366
l'm gonna have to take it away, though, soon as the ride is over.

1480
01:54:46,046 --> 01:54:48,965
Jack Foley? Meet Hijirah Henry.

1481
01:54:59,643 --> 01:55:01,603
What kind of a name is Hijirah?

1482
01:55:01,645 --> 01:55:05,148
- lt's lslamic. - What's it stand for?

1483
01:55:05,191 --> 01:55:08,652
The ''Hijirah'' was Mohammed's flight from Mecca in 622.

1484
01:55:08,694 --> 01:55:13,156
- His flight? - Brothers in Leavenworth gave me that name.

1485
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:15,158
You were in Leavenworth, huh?

1486
01:55:15,242 --> 01:55:18,203
- For a time. - Meaning?

1487
01:55:18,287 --> 01:55:21,331
- Meaning, time came, l left. - You busted out.

1488
01:55:21,374 --> 01:55:24,919
l prefer to think of it as an exodus from an undesirable place.

1489
01:55:28,214 --> 01:55:30,549
- How long before they caught up with you? - That time?

1490
01:55:32,843 --> 01:55:36,179
- There were others? - Yeah. That was the ninth.

1491
01:55:38,182 --> 01:55:40,642
The ninth?

1492
01:55:40,685 --> 01:55:44,522
Well, ten if you count that prison hospital in Ohio l walked away from.

1493
01:55:44,564 --> 01:55:47,358
- You done a lot of walkin', Henry. - Hijirah.

1494
01:55:47,441 --> 01:55:50,819
Hijirah. Now we're off to Glades.

1495
01:55:50,862 --> 01:55:55,032
Yeah, it looks that way.

1496
01:55:55,074 --> 01:55:57,826
l was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal,

1497
01:55:57,869 --> 01:56:01,247
but for some reason she wanted to wait.

1498
01:56:01,330 --> 01:56:05,208
- She did, huh? - Guess it's cheaper taking two of us down in one van.

1499
01:56:05,293 --> 01:56:10,548
Could be. Maybe she thought we had a lot to talk about.

1500
01:56:10,590 --> 01:56:12,675
Really? Like what?

1501
01:56:14,344 --> 01:56:18,890
l don't know. Long ride to Florida.

1502
01:56:30,860 --> 01:56:36,532
lt's your thing Do what you wanna do

1503
01:56:36,574 --> 01:56:40,452
l can't tell ya who to sock it to

1504
01:56:40,537 --> 01:56:45,458
lt's your thing Do what you wanna do

1505
01:56:47,043 --> 01:56:50,588
l can't tell ya who to sock it to

1506
01:56:50,630 --> 01:56:56,010
lf you want me to love you maybe l will

1507
01:56:56,094 --> 01:57:01,140
Believe me, woman it ain't no big deal

1508
01:57:01,224 --> 01:57:06,354
Ah, you need love now just the same as l do

1509
01:57:06,438 --> 01:57:11,276
Makes me no difference now who you give your thing to

1510
01:57:11,317 --> 01:57:17,615
Ah, it's your thing Do what you wanna do
