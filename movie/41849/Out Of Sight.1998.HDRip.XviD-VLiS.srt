you do for a living you pack a shotgun?

confess his sins.

he happened to rob at the time.

more banks than anybody in the computer.

under different circumstances...

236
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:24,465
if you were in a bar and
I came up and we started talkin'...

- I wonder what would happen.
- Nothing.

- You'd probably tell me.

under different circumstances...

was Three Days of the Condor.

when he was young.

Now, you get your clothes cleaned,
you send me the bill.

I'll send it to you at Glades.

What, did you crawl through
a sewer, man? Who're you?

- Take your sunglasses off.
- I see better with 'em on, man.

I'm gonna throw them off
while they're still on your head.

to bring the clean clothes.

- I'll tell you...

293
00:23:50,412 --> 00:23:52,972
- What's your problem, Jack?
- I don't know why you got Glenn
involved in this.

294
00:23:53,048 --> 00:23:55,380
- How 'bout the score was
his idea to begin with?
- Idea...

295
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,509
The guy's got a fuckin'
vacant lot for a head.

296
00:23:57,586 --> 00:24:01,522
He thinks he can talk
to me like that? Shit.

297
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:06,527
"Gimme your jacket." I have been
sitting here for over a half-hour,

298
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:10,395
watchin' out for the Highway Patrol,
if you think that's fun.

299
00:24:10,465 --> 00:24:13,923
God. You know, I hadda go
over there in the bushes...

300
00:24:14,002 --> 00:24:18,336
to smoke a joint, just so I could like,
[Whistles] you know?

301
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:23,207
Yep. I got somethin'
big lined up, up north.

302
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:27,612
Yeah, these guys? Wouldn't even fuckin'
know about it if it wasn't for me.

303
00:24:27,682 --> 00:24:31,140
- Every time he opens his mouth,
I wanna punch him out.
- He's not the problem, Jack.

304
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:34,188
You wanna pull your head
outta your ass, tell me why the hell
we're bringing her with us?

305
00:24:34,256 --> 00:24:36,486
- Glenn.
- [Mumbling]

306
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,856
You don't remember me, do you?

307
00:24:40,862 --> 00:24:45,595
Um, couldn't have been Glades
if that's what you're thinkin',
'cause I was never out there.

308
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:49,467
- No, that's not what I'm thinking.
- Oh, yeah?

309
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:53,030
But you're sure
we've met, huh?

310
00:24:53,108 --> 00:24:54,803
- Last fall.
- [Chuckles]

311
00:24:54,876 --> 00:24:59,939
I drove you from the Palm Beach County
Jail to the federal courthouse... twice.

312
00:25:00,015 --> 00:25:02,347
You're Glenn Michaels.

313
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,147
I never forget anybody
I've cuffed and shackled.

314
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,916
Now let's think about this for a minute,
Glenn, see if we can't work it out.

315
00:25:07,989 --> 00:25:11,652
Do we have a gun in the car?

316
00:25:11,726 --> 00:25:14,559
Oh, shit!
I remember you! Hey!

317
00:25:14,629 --> 00:25:17,928
Foley's not gonna make it,
and if he goes down, you go with him.

318
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:20,832
- Now, look. I can understand
if you guys are close, but...
- No, we're not.

319
00:25:20,902 --> 00:25:26,135
- But, yeah. I'm helpin' him.
- Now wait a minute, Glenn.

320
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:28,142
Have you helped him?

321
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:32,374
I mean, technically,
at this point, I doubt you could be
charged with aiding a fugitive.

322
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,415
So you still have a choice.

323
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:38,475
You wanna take her to my place, get
cleaned up, come out of the bathroom...

324
00:25:38,553 --> 00:25:41,647
with your aftershave on, and she goes,
"Oh. I had you all wrong."

325
00:25:41,723 --> 00:25:43,657
No. I just wanna talk
to her again, that's all.

326
00:25:43,725 --> 00:25:47,525
I just wanna see what it might have
been like under normal circumstances.

327
00:25:47,596 --> 00:25:50,030
- It's too late for that, Jack.
- [Car Engine Starting]

328
00:25:50,098 --> 00:25:52,464
He wants to get out of here,
and I don't blame him.

329
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,319
[Crowd Cheering]

330
00:26:31,273 --> 00:26:35,232
Ref don't call it soon, Snoop's gonna
send this cat out in a body bag.

331
00:26:36,711 --> 00:26:39,407
Anybody ever tell you
why they call him "Snoopy"?

332
00:26:41,616 --> 00:26:44,176
He used to be
Maurice "Mad Dog" Miller...

333
00:26:44,252 --> 00:26:46,720
back when he was a pro.

334
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,358
Now you pet him,
he goes down.

335
00:26:56,598 --> 00:26:59,567
- I don't believe it!
- Oh, my!

336
00:26:59,634 --> 00:27:04,003
[Crowd Chattering, Booing]

337
00:27:04,072 --> 00:27:06,870
[Crowd Chanting]
Bullshit! Bullshit!

338
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,372
Yeah, you the man.

339
00:27:17,752 --> 00:27:19,720
Guy's bragging he won
a thrown fight.

340
00:27:19,788 --> 00:27:21,722
Fuckin' pathetic.

341
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,494
Dangerous is what it is.

342
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:34,602
- Who's the bald dude?
- Richard Ripley.

343
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:37,103
The Wall Street guy?

344
00:27:37,172 --> 00:27:39,902
Call him Dick The Ripper on account
of all the guys he ripped off.

345
00:27:39,974 --> 00:27:43,205
Oh, yeah. I didn't
recognize him without his rug.

346
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:45,303
- What's his bid?
- Three years.

347
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:48,440
You guys on the bench? Okay.

348
00:27:48,516 --> 00:27:52,577
Three years, fined $50 million
and wrote 'em a fuckin' check.

349
00:27:52,654 --> 00:27:54,622
Just like that.

350
00:27:54,689 --> 00:27:57,351
[Straining]
Fifty mill, signed his name.

351
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,519
Didn't even... Didn't even...
Okay, a little help.

352
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,426
Okay, heavy!
[Grunting]

353
00:28:02,497 --> 00:28:04,431
Heavy! Come on!

354
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,035
[Grunting]

355
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:12,005
All the bright glare out here,
you couldn't read the numbers
on the weights.

356
00:28:12,073 --> 00:28:14,940
Oh. I had it. Jesus.

357
00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:18,775
- How do you know he wrote a check?
- Uh, he told me.

358
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:21,441
We work laundry together.

359
00:28:21,516 --> 00:28:23,780
[Grunts]
Guy loves to fucking talk.

360
00:28:23,852 --> 00:28:27,049
Yeah, he loves to talk.
He talked to the U.S. Attorney.

361
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,647
Rolled over on all the snitches
he was doing business with.

362
00:28:29,724 --> 00:28:34,127
Hey! Any guy who can write
a fuckin' check for $50 million,

363
00:28:34,195 --> 00:28:37,790
he says anything,
I'm all fuckin' ears.

364
00:28:37,866 --> 00:28:41,802
Guy tells me he's got
all this money in foreign banks.

365
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,270
Plus, around, mmm,

366
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:48,207
five million in uncut diamonds
at his house.

367
00:28:48,276 --> 00:28:50,210
He said, quote,

368
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:53,145
that I can get my hands on it
at any time.

369
00:28:53,214 --> 00:28:55,444
- Where does he live?
- Detroit.

370
00:28:55,517 --> 00:29:00,682
Snoopy Miller says that uncut diamonds
are as easy to move as cash.

371
00:29:03,191 --> 00:29:05,523
Ever seen
an uncut diamond, Studs?

372
00:29:05,593 --> 00:29:08,391
Looks just like
a plain, old rock.

373
00:29:08,463 --> 00:29:12,524
- Wait, you think this guy's lying?
- [Chuckling]

374
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:18,236
What do you think, Studs? Use
your head. Some guy's got $5 million...

375
00:29:18,306 --> 00:29:22,936
socked away in his house,
and he's gonna tell some motormouth
he just met in prison about it.

376
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,870
Oh, I see.
You guys are cynical. Right.

377
00:29:37,826 --> 00:29:39,760
Here it comes.

378
00:29:53,408 --> 00:29:56,206
Keep on walking. Keep walking.

379
00:29:56,277 --> 00:29:58,677
You don't wanna be
answering any questions.

380
00:30:06,287 --> 00:30:08,585
I'm just saying
she wasn't scared, that's all.

381
00:30:08,656 --> 00:30:11,921
That's 'cause she had
her hand on her gun the whole time
waitin' to make her move.

382
00:30:11,993 --> 00:30:14,826
You're just jealous 'cause
it was me in the trunk with her...

383
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,830
- and not you.
- You're right.

384
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:20,698
The first thing I'm gonna do...
is get this mud off me.

385
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:56,554
Hey.

386
00:32:25,426 --> 00:32:27,519
[Mr. Sisco]
Karen?

387
00:32:27,595 --> 00:32:28,721
Karen, honey?

388
00:32:29,998 --> 00:32:33,297
Karen?

389
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,700
You were talking
in your sleep.

390
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,704
[Sighs]

391
00:32:40,575 --> 00:32:42,736
What'd I say?

392
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,744
"Hey, yourself."

393
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:49,706
- Huh.
- [Knock At Door]

394
00:32:49,784 --> 00:32:52,309
[Karen]
Hello, Daniel.

395
00:32:55,623 --> 00:32:57,557
[Groaning]

396
00:32:57,625 --> 00:33:02,062
Daniel Burdon, F.B.I.

397
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,530
Marshall Sisco, Karen's dad.

398
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:06,533
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

399
00:33:06,601 --> 00:33:08,535
Umm...

400
00:33:08,603 --> 00:33:11,731
Would you mind, please,
waiting outside?

401
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:13,899
We have some business
to do here.

402
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,576
Well, uh, I have
to use the john anyway.

403
00:33:18,646 --> 00:33:20,580
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

404
00:33:25,486 --> 00:33:28,614
I wanna be
on the task force, Daniel.

405
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,988
Well...

406
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:35,553
That's nice of you
to offer, Karen, but...

407
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:39,691
I got all the help
I can use right now.

408
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:44,227
Instead, let's talk about
how you got that bump on your head.

409
00:33:44,305 --> 00:33:46,773
Isn't that my file
you're holding on to?

410
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:50,038
Yes, but I want
to hear it from you,

411
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:53,638
starting... with when
you grabbed the wheel.

412
00:33:53,715 --> 00:33:56,548
Where was this?

413
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:58,551
Coming to the Okeechobee exit.

414
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:01,782
- [Glenn] Sit back!
- Can you see with those glasses on?

415
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,620
I'm fine!
This is... stupid, man.

416
00:34:04,692 --> 00:34:07,126
These guys are gonna be
so disappointed in me, man.

417
00:34:07,195 --> 00:34:09,527
You know what?
If I wasn't stoned,

418
00:34:09,597 --> 00:34:12,566
there is no way that you would have
talked me into this.

419
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,466
- Remember that.
- Get off at the exit
right after that bridge.

420
00:34:15,536 --> 00:34:19,097
No, I am not fucking turning
myself in, so forget it!

421
00:34:19,173 --> 00:34:21,266
- Get off at that exit!
- What exit?

422
00:34:21,342 --> 00:34:23,742
- That exit right there. Take that exit!
- Sit back! No!

423
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:33,612
[Karen's Voice]
The next thing I knew,

424
00:34:33,688 --> 00:34:37,089
the paramedics were
pulling me out of the car.

425
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,991
- You all right?
- [Daniel] There's a couple
of points I keep wondering about...

426
00:34:40,061 --> 00:34:42,222
have to do with the two guys
that grabbed you.

427
00:34:42,296 --> 00:34:46,357
Buddy, is it?
And this fella Jack Foley.

428
00:34:46,434 --> 00:34:50,097
I swear, the man must have robbed
over 200 banks in his time.

429
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,105
- Really?
- Um-hmm.

430
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,437
He told me he didn't
remember how many he robbed.

431
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,034
Then you talked to him.

432
00:34:57,111 --> 00:34:59,477
In the trunk, yeah.

433
00:34:59,547 --> 00:35:02,072
What'd you talk about?

434
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,175
Different things.

435
00:35:04,252 --> 00:35:07,119
Prison, movies.

436
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:11,852
This fella holds you hostage,
you talk about movies?

437
00:35:14,162 --> 00:35:16,995
It was an unusual experience.

438
00:35:17,064 --> 00:35:20,033
You know, Foley made me think
of that fella Carl Tillman.

439
00:35:20,101 --> 00:35:23,696
The one that you were seeing,
it turns out, the same time
he was robbing banks.

440
00:35:23,771 --> 00:35:26,205
- Do you recall that?
- And what happened to Carl?

441
00:35:26,274 --> 00:35:30,210
The time came, you shot him. But you
didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.

442
00:35:30,278 --> 00:35:34,840
They're unarmed, you had a shotgun
and you let them throw you in the trunk.

443
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:37,316
Okay. Now you got
your Sig in your hand,

444
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,785
and you say in the report
that you couldn't turn around.

445
00:35:39,854 --> 00:35:43,153
He had you pinned down.
But when the trunk opened,

446
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,920
how come you didn't
cap the two guys then?

447
00:35:45,993 --> 00:35:49,360
What do you work on most of the time?
Fraud? Go after crooked bookkeepers?

448
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:53,992
Karen, I've been with the bureau
15 years on all kinds of investigations.

449
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:57,003
- Have you ever shot a man?
- No.

450
00:35:57,071 --> 00:36:00,529
- When was the last time you were
primary through the door?
- I have to qualify?

451
00:36:00,608 --> 00:36:02,599
You have to know
what you're talking about.

452
00:36:02,677 --> 00:36:05,237
[Snickering]

453
00:36:07,448 --> 00:36:10,110
We'll talk another time.
All right, Karen?

454
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:16,617
I'd like to know why Foley
put you in that second car
when he didn't need you anymore.

455
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,027
You'll have to ask him that.

456
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:28,160
[Chattering]

457
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,102
Rip, Rip.

458
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:42,172
- What the deal is, baby?
- Hi, Maurice.

459
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,718
- Oops. I don't know.
- Make a fist...

460
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:47,276
- There you go.
- Fuck it, man.

461
00:36:47,355 --> 00:36:49,550
- Got your little fishies for you.
- Oh, good.

462
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:54,823
Not so fast. Starting out,
there's gonna be an across the board
cost of living increase.

463
00:36:54,896 --> 00:36:58,423
- What?
- When I got put in here a year ago
on credit card fraud,

464
00:36:58,499 --> 00:37:00,433
I didn't really get
no props for that.

465
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:04,267
But ever since I shanked
that loudmouth pussy in the yard,

466
00:37:04,338 --> 00:37:08,832
it's like my Dun and Broadstreet around
this bitch done shot way the fuck up.

467
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:12,869
Actually, it's Dun and Bradstreet.
That's the, uh...

468
00:37:12,947 --> 00:37:15,245
Well, I've heard it both ways.

469
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,910
Point is that the price
has gone up around this bitch too.

470
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:20,954
Get your little black book out.
We got some business to talk about.

471
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,255
For the little fishies...
What'd I say they was gonna be?

472
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:29,455
- Two thousand.
- Now they're gonna be three thousand.

473
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:32,522
- Come on. You...
- Now they're gonna be three thousand.

474
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,534
[Sighing]

475
00:37:34,602 --> 00:37:37,002
That saltwater shit
you put in your eyes?

476
00:37:37,071 --> 00:37:39,904
- What do you call that?
- Bausch & Lomb.

477
00:37:39,974 --> 00:37:43,068
Yeah, that bushy lawn shit.
That's 300.

478
00:37:43,144 --> 00:37:46,443
- I need it.
- Yeah, you do. And that extra pillow.

479
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,711
I'm gonna get that for you,
but that's gonna be like five C's.

480
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:51,718
- Five?
- [Foley] Hey.

481
00:37:51,786 --> 00:37:55,222
Sign says shut the fuck up,
or can't you fellas read?

482
00:37:55,289 --> 00:37:57,450
Who the fuck
you talkin' to, man?

483
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:01,057
You got a problem
over there, Foley?

484
00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:06,259
Yeah, this is
the dumbest fucking shakedown
in the history of dumb shakedowns.

485
00:38:06,334 --> 00:38:08,632
- Five hundred bucks for a pillow?
- That's right.

486
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,831
- It does seem a little high,
doesn't it?
- Shut up, Dick.

487
00:38:11,906 --> 00:38:14,033
- Must be a nice pillow.
- Full goose down.

488
00:38:14,108 --> 00:38:17,043
- Look, you still...
- How much for your company at chow?

489
00:38:17,111 --> 00:38:20,410
My company? Come on, man. You know
I'll watch this motherfucker's back.

490
00:38:20,481 --> 00:38:23,143
- How much?
- That's a C-note.

491
00:38:25,486 --> 00:38:28,216
If you're smart, Ripley,
you'll tell this guy to fuck off.

492
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:30,223
Really?

493
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:32,919
Well, l... l...
I don't know.

494
00:38:32,994 --> 00:38:36,327
First of all, if he kills you,
then he's gonna get nothin'.

495
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,730
Well, uh, the man don't
just have to die, Foley.

496
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,827
He could accidentally hurt himself
falling down on something real hard.

497
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:47,772
Like a shiv or my dick.

498
00:38:47,842 --> 00:38:50,504
I'll pay. I'll pay it.
Don't worry.

499
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,944
If he falls on anything, Snoop,

500
00:38:53,014 --> 00:38:56,780
then they're gonna transfer
his ass outta here faster
than you can throw a fight...

501
00:38:56,851 --> 00:38:59,081
and you're still
gonna get nothin'.

502
00:38:59,153 --> 00:39:01,713
[Laughs]
You know, last time I checked, man,

503
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:04,223
this shit over here ain't
got nothin' to do with you.

504
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:07,055
Why don't you go outside?
Smoke a cigarette or some shit.

505
00:39:07,128 --> 00:39:09,392
I don't smoke.

506
00:39:09,463 --> 00:39:12,227
You heard the man. Why don't
you get your punk ass up outta here?

507
00:39:12,299 --> 00:39:15,894
- Uh-oh.
- You fucked up now, man. That's Himey.

508
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:19,462
Protégé of mine. Ranked number 32
in the federal prison system.

509
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,474
- Thirty-two?
- That's right.

510
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:24,102
- Out of, what, 20.
- Kick this cracker's ass.

511
00:39:26,647 --> 00:39:29,115
[Whistles]

512
00:39:31,852 --> 00:39:34,047
- What's going on here?
- Uh, nothin'.

513
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:37,750
Just "reading is fundamental" shit.
We got all excited and everything.

514
00:39:37,825 --> 00:39:39,793
Clear outta here. Now.

515
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,226
- No problem.
- All of you. Let's go.

516
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:49,235
Uh, Snoopy.
I think we settled the fish thing.

517
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,237
Oh, the fish. Yeah.

518
00:40:02,249 --> 00:40:04,683
That's how you
do the shake, partner.

519
00:40:10,424 --> 00:40:13,655
[Buddy]
Paper says there's ten grand each
on you, Chino and Lulu.

520
00:40:13,727 --> 00:40:15,661
They say anything about Karen?

521
00:40:15,729 --> 00:40:17,663
Just that she got away. Here.

522
00:40:17,731 --> 00:40:19,756
- Hmm?
- Jack!

523
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,768
- [Man] Hey!
- That's all right. It's in the pool.

524
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,896
Did it say what happened to her
after she took off with Glenn?

525
00:40:24,972 --> 00:40:26,906
I don't know.
You'll have to ask Glenn.

526
00:40:26,974 --> 00:40:29,636
He's probably on his way to Detroit,
which is where we should be.

527
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,702
- Yeah.
- Do you realize what you're doing?

528
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,180
Worrying about a woman
who works for law enforcement?

529
00:40:35,249 --> 00:40:38,810
You wanna sit down and have cocktails
with a woman who tried to shoot you.

530
00:40:38,886 --> 00:40:42,117
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Do you think this old guy's
her boyfriend?

531
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,123
It's the only picture
she has in here.

532
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,625
Am I going to Detroit by myself?

533
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,889
The longer we stay here,
the better chance there is...

534
00:40:48,963 --> 00:40:50,897
that either Glenn
is gonna screw up the score,

535
00:40:50,965 --> 00:40:54,059
or we gonna get busted or both.

536
00:40:58,405 --> 00:41:00,339
[Marshall]
This is Foley?

537
00:41:00,407 --> 00:41:02,807
- Karen?
- Hmm?

538
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:07,007
- This is Foley?
- [Radio] (music) How lucky can one guy be (music)

539
00:41:07,081 --> 00:41:10,175
- (music) [Continues, Indistinct]
- Doesn't even look like that.

540
00:41:10,251 --> 00:41:14,085
- Oh, no?
- Uh-uh. He looks a lot like...

541
00:41:16,524 --> 00:41:18,458
Different.

542
00:41:23,831 --> 00:41:26,231
Wyatt Earp is here.

543
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:34,941
- Hey.
- Hey.

544
00:41:35,009 --> 00:41:37,443
- How you feelin'? Feel better?
- Good. Yeah.

545
00:41:37,511 --> 00:41:40,480
- Is your dad taking good care of you?
- He took the week off...

546
00:41:40,548 --> 00:41:44,109
to take care of me and he's worked on
his boat every day since.

547
00:41:44,185 --> 00:41:46,483
- Dad, this is Ray Nicolet.
- Hi.

548
00:41:46,554 --> 00:41:49,921
- Pleasure to meet you.
I heard a lot about you.
- Likewise.

549
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:53,391
Ray's working with the F.B.I.
Task force on the prison break.

550
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:57,328
I see that. Tell me, Ray, do you ever
wear one that says "undercover"?

551
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,525
- No.
- How's it going?

552
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,537
Sit down.

553
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:08,132
Okay. Good.
We caught one of them.

554
00:42:08,209 --> 00:42:10,200
- Was it Foley?
- Was it off a tip?

555
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:13,769
Somebody spotted two of them
out in this hobo camp near the airport.

556
00:42:13,847 --> 00:42:15,974
Called in the number.
That was it.

557
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,985
- I knew it as soon
as I as there was a reward.
- Was it Foley?

558
00:42:19,053 --> 00:42:22,045
No, Linares,
one of the Cubans.

559
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:25,580
We went in there with full SWAT,
two choppers, that whole deal.

560
00:42:25,659 --> 00:42:28,093
[Sighs] Linares goes nuts,
starts shooting, so we took him out.

561
00:42:28,162 --> 00:42:31,097
I don't know how Chirino
got away, but he did.

562
00:42:31,165 --> 00:42:34,157
- And Foley hadn't been there.
- No, this place was strictly Cuban.

563
00:42:34,235 --> 00:42:38,433
Foley had a ride. He must have
his own agenda. You know what I mean?

564
00:42:38,505 --> 00:42:41,838
He seems to be the only guy
who kinda knows what he's doing.

565
00:42:41,909 --> 00:42:43,843
- Uh-huh.
- [Phone Ringing]

566
00:42:43,911 --> 00:42:46,539
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

567
00:42:46,614 --> 00:42:48,605
Hello?

568
00:42:48,682 --> 00:42:51,344
Yeah, she is.
Just a minute, please.

569
00:42:51,418 --> 00:42:53,352
Karen.

570
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,218
- Hello?
- Hi.

571
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:01,219
You know who this is?

572
00:43:01,295 --> 00:43:04,560
Yes. [Whispers]
Five minutes.

573
00:43:11,272 --> 00:43:13,206
So. Ray.

574
00:43:13,274 --> 00:43:15,970
- Yeah.
- There's something I'm wondering.

575
00:43:16,043 --> 00:43:19,945
The headline reads, "I slept with
a murderer, says shaken Miami woman."

576
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,140
- Who is it that answered the phone?
- None of your business.

577
00:43:23,217 --> 00:43:26,118
I'm just worried maybe
I'm not old enough for you.

578
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:29,644
- It was my dad.
- Really?

579
00:43:29,723 --> 00:43:33,716
- He's got a cop's face.
- How do you know?

580
00:43:33,794 --> 00:43:37,560
- Oh, wait. You have my wallet.
- And your gun.

581
00:43:37,631 --> 00:43:39,997
- Think I can have 'em back?
- How do we do that?

582
00:43:40,067 --> 00:43:43,002
You can come by my dad's place
and drop 'em off.

583
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:45,903
I could leave it with the SWAT guy
that answers the door.

584
00:43:45,973 --> 00:43:48,703
There's a guy here
on the task force right now.

585
00:43:48,776 --> 00:43:51,301
Maybe I should put him on the phone
and let the two of you work it out.

586
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,573
- You wouldn't do that.
- Why not?

587
00:43:53,647 --> 00:43:57,242
Because you're having
too much fun.

588
00:43:57,318 --> 00:43:59,252
She fixes him pork chops and rice.

589
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,084
The next thing you know,
they're making love on the sofa.

590
00:44:02,156 --> 00:44:04,147
She says he was very gentle.

591
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:07,990
This guy, Chirino, shows up at the
house, says he misses his little girl.

592
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:11,691
She feels sorry for him.
Next thing you know... boom.

593
00:44:11,765 --> 00:44:14,791
- On the couch.
- That's how you score now, huh?

594
00:44:16,337 --> 00:44:18,271
I guess.

595
00:44:18,339 --> 00:44:20,398
There's something
I've been wondering.

596
00:44:20,474 --> 00:44:22,567
Whatever happened
to your Uncle Cully?

597
00:44:22,643 --> 00:44:25,009
You think he's gonna
tell you where I am?

598
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,912
- Unless you wanna tell me.
- He's dead.

599
00:44:27,981 --> 00:44:29,915
Did 27 years before he got out,

600
00:44:29,983 --> 00:44:33,077
and he died a couple of years afterwards
in a charity hospital...

601
00:44:33,153 --> 00:44:35,951
by trying to make up
for all the good times he missed.

602
00:44:36,023 --> 00:44:38,116
That's not gonna be me.

603
00:44:38,192 --> 00:44:42,128
What, one last score, retire
to some island? Is that the idea?

604
00:44:42,196 --> 00:44:44,824
- Jack.
- I'm partial to mountains myself,

605
00:44:44,898 --> 00:44:47,526
but if you like islands,
we'll make it an island.

606
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:51,765
- What do you mean,
"we'll make it an island"?
- You and I can make it...

607
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,307
- Jack, you better come
and check this out.
- Is that Buddy?

608
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:57,071
- What? No. Okay. Bye-bye.
- Who're you talking to?

609
00:44:57,144 --> 00:44:58,873
[Dial Tone]

610
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,880
- So she's a married woman.
- Right.

611
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,473
But she goes to bed
with a prison escapee because...

612
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:06,110
he tells her that
he misses his little girl.

613
00:45:06,186 --> 00:45:09,178
She tells the world about it.
But you protect her.

614
00:45:09,256 --> 00:45:12,089
You don't reveal her name.

615
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:14,855
That makes it sound like
what she was doing was okay...

616
00:45:14,928 --> 00:45:17,055
as long as her husband
doesn't find out.

617
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:21,795
Like the guy who cheats
on his wife, saying what
she doesn't know won't bother her.

618
00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:23,803
- Dad.
- What?

619
00:45:24,872 --> 00:45:28,137
[Chuckling]

620
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:34,106
Ray, I wanna show you
something... in the living room.

621
00:45:35,382 --> 00:45:37,850
- Yeah.
- Good talking to you, Ray.

622
00:45:37,918 --> 00:45:39,852
Yeah, you too.

623
00:45:44,091 --> 00:45:46,286
[Woman On TV] Federal law enforcement
agents raided a squatters camp...

624
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,022
north of Miami International
Airport this morning...

625
00:45:49,096 --> 00:45:54,363
in the hopes of capturing
a fugitive from Tuesday's daring escape
from Glades prison.

626
00:45:54,435 --> 00:45:58,269
F.B.I. Officials confirm that
one of the escapees, Arelio Linares,

627
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,966
- was killed...
- [Jack] Chino's gonna
wanna talk to me.

628
00:46:01,041 --> 00:46:04,306
- [Continues Indistinct]
- Chino's runnin' for his life.
He don't give a shit about you.

629
00:46:04,378 --> 00:46:08,212
He's gonna know by now
I gave him up back at Glades.
He's gonna wanna find me.

630
00:46:08,282 --> 00:46:11,149
Maybe see Adele,
see what she knows.

631
00:46:11,218 --> 00:46:13,948
He knows where she lives?

632
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,683
Jack!

633
00:46:16,757 --> 00:46:18,748
We were talking once,
drinking rum,

634
00:46:18,826 --> 00:46:21,852
and I may have
mentioned Adele.

635
00:46:21,929 --> 00:46:24,420
How she worked for a magician.
Chino got all interested.

636
00:46:24,498 --> 00:46:27,126
He said, "How do you saw
the woman in half?"

637
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:30,466
Maybe he wanted to meet her,
maybe see her if she came to visit.

638
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:33,995
Oh, okay, okay. So you call her up
and tell her don't talk to any Cubans.

639
00:46:34,074 --> 00:46:37,271
- The phone's probably tapped by now.
- You're right.

640
00:46:37,344 --> 00:46:39,778
And if the phone is tapped,
you know they have her place staked out.

641
00:46:39,847 --> 00:46:41,872
- Shit!
- [Phone Ringing]

642
00:46:44,117 --> 00:46:46,051
Adele Delisi speaking.

643
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:49,350
- [Chino] Uh, uh, this is Adele?
- Yes, it is.

644
00:46:49,423 --> 00:46:51,357
Oh... Uh, sorry.
Wrong number.

645
00:47:07,941 --> 00:47:10,171
Nice disguise.

646
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,178
I'm a tourist.

647
00:47:14,014 --> 00:47:16,778
[Jack]
All right. Here we go.

648
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:21,014
Coming up right here...
on the left.

649
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:24,285
- What about the guy with the clippers?
- I wonder what the F.B.I...

650
00:47:24,358 --> 00:47:26,986
is charging to trim hedges
these days?

651
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:31,292
- Quite a checker game
they got goin' on too.
- Pull on up.

652
00:47:54,755 --> 00:47:56,985
[Jack]
Oh, man.

653
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,761
Oh, man.

654
00:48:05,832 --> 00:48:07,891
Okay, you saw her.
That's all you get.

655
00:48:13,941 --> 00:48:17,570
- Let's go to Detroit.
- Now you're talkin', brother.

656
00:48:19,413 --> 00:48:22,246
[Adele] I'll say one thing for Jack...
he's very considerate.

657
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,341
Lights on or off,
if you know what I mean.

658
00:48:24,418 --> 00:48:26,249
- Really.
- Hmm.

659
00:48:29,356 --> 00:48:31,790
Adele, listen...

660
00:48:31,858 --> 00:48:36,591
I just want to find him
before he does something else
and makes it worse on himself.

661
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:40,565
No. [Slurps]
Buddy'll take care of him.

662
00:48:40,634 --> 00:48:44,297
Keep him out of trouble.
He's Jack's conscience, always has been.

663
00:48:44,371 --> 00:48:48,102
They must have robbed
50 banks together.

664
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:51,975
- They were a really great team.
- Until they got busted.

665
00:48:52,045 --> 00:48:54,912
Hmm. That wasn't Jack's fault,
no, that was on account of...

666
00:48:54,982 --> 00:48:59,612
Buddy, for some reason, decided to call
his sister and confess to the job...

667
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:02,018
before they'd done it
instead of after.

668
00:49:02,089 --> 00:49:06,719
Well, she called the F.B.I. They both
went down, and they ended up at Lompoc.

669
00:49:06,793 --> 00:49:09,819
I think Buddy felt
kind of bad about that.

670
00:49:11,164 --> 00:49:14,156
Adele, do you have any idea
where I could find Buddy?

671
00:49:14,234 --> 00:49:18,330
- Or Glenn?
- [Knock On Door]

- Yes.
- Mira, I'd like to speak to you, please.

674
00:49:24,244 --> 00:49:27,543
- Well, who is it?
- Emile, you know, the guy
you used to work for?

675
00:49:27,614 --> 00:49:30,674
- Uh...
- He gave me your number
and where you live.

Can I speak to you, please?

- Oh. Uh, yeah.
- All right.

00:49:37,257 --> 00:49:39,225
You did work for Emile, right?

679
00:49:39,292 --> 00:49:42,455
Uh, yeah, I was Emile's box jumper
for four years, almost.

680
00:49:42,529 --> 00:49:44,463
Cono! You were what, his box?

681
00:49:44,531 --> 00:49:46,522
- Uh, his assistant.
- Oh, okay.

682
00:49:48,635 --> 00:49:51,035
You say you perform
in the Miami area?

683
00:49:51,104 --> 00:49:53,971
Oh, si. Here, there, you know.

684
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:57,636
I was a magician in Cuba. They used
to call me Manuelito the Magician.

685
00:49:57,711 --> 00:49:59,804
Mira, can you please open?

686
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,680
- I'm not dressed.
- I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.

687
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:07,277
- You know Jack?
- Who are you?

688
00:50:07,354 --> 00:50:09,447
Jose Chirino.

689
00:50:09,523 --> 00:50:13,619
Or maybe you heard Jack call me Chino.
Bueno, I'm the same guy.

690
00:50:13,694 --> 00:50:16,788
Tell him he has to wait in the hall.
You have to get dressed. Say it loud.

691
00:50:16,863 --> 00:50:19,093
Wait in the hall.
You have to get dressed.

692
00:50:19,166 --> 00:50:22,624
Mira, mira, you tell me
where I could find Jack
and I don't bother you no more.

693
00:50:22,703 --> 00:50:25,297
Now, come on, please! Hello?

694
00:50:25,372 --> 00:50:28,899
- I don't know where he is.
- I'm the guy that helped
Jack escape from prison.

695
00:50:28,975 --> 00:50:32,570
- Mira, please open this fucking door...
- I'm gonna call the police.

696
00:50:32,646 --> 00:50:37,709
Cono, why you gonna do that
to a friend, man? A partner to Jack?

697
00:50:39,086 --> 00:50:41,884
That's it! That's it!

698
00:50:48,895 --> 00:50:52,524
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

- Adele! Adele!
- Give me your hand.

700
00:50:54,601 --> 00:50:57,502
- You not Adele!
- I'm a federal marshal,
and you're under arrest.

701
00:50:57,571 --> 00:51:00,540
- Get my bag, Adele.
- Oh.

702
00:51:00,607 --> 00:51:02,632
Mira, please, please. I think
there's a misunderstanding here.

703
00:51:02,709 --> 00:51:04,677
Can you...
you got nice bag.

704
00:51:04,745 --> 00:51:08,511
Mira, let's say we just forget about it,
okay? We forget about this, I go home...

705
00:51:08,582 --> 00:51:11,608
- Shut up.
- Owwww! Who the hell
taught you how to do that?

706
00:51:11,685 --> 00:51:13,778
- Give me your other hand.
- Okay, okay. Ay, cono.

707
00:51:13,854 --> 00:51:16,618
Ohhhh!
I gotta go make pee-pee.

708
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:19,454
Ohhhhh! Owww!

709
00:51:19,526 --> 00:51:21,994
Wow! You are mean!

710
00:51:22,062 --> 00:51:26,465
Look, I'm gonna call my lawyer.
This is... What do they call that?
Human rights violation.

711
00:51:26,533 --> 00:51:29,696
- Ay, cono.
- Daniel Burdon, please. Karen Sisco.

712
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:32,534
Mira, Adele, Adele.
Can I ask you a question, please?

713
00:51:32,606 --> 00:51:35,040
You know that trick you do?

714
00:51:35,108 --> 00:51:38,566
Karen? Where are you?
I've been trying to reach you.

715
00:51:38,645 --> 00:51:40,909
When you in the box
and they saw you in half?

716
00:51:40,981 --> 00:51:44,007
- I'm at Adele Delisi's.
- It's magic.

717
00:51:44,084 --> 00:51:46,518
We already talked to her.
That's a dead end.

718
00:51:46,586 --> 00:51:51,250
I was just wondering,
if I brought in Chirino,
would you let me be on the task force?

719
00:51:51,324 --> 00:51:53,724
- Yeah, sure, Karen.
- Then they put the saw through,
and they separate it.

720
00:51:53,794 --> 00:51:57,491
- And that's it. Ta da.
- But how do you twinkle your toes?
I don't get that.

721
00:51:57,564 --> 00:52:00,931
You bring Chirino in,
and you can be on the task force.

722
00:52:01,001 --> 00:52:03,595
- That's all I wanted to know.
- Good.

723
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:06,901
Now, would you forget
about the ex-wife,

724
00:52:06,973 --> 00:52:09,339
and get over to the Adams Hotel?

725
00:52:09,409 --> 00:52:12,071
- You got it.
- Then they open it up...

726
00:52:12,145 --> 00:52:14,841
- No! No!
- Come on.

727
00:52:14,915 --> 00:52:18,715
- And then that's it.
- Fake legs.

728
00:52:18,785 --> 00:52:22,186
- Mmm.
- Fake legs? How you gonna...

729
00:52:22,255 --> 00:52:24,780
- Ay! Cono.
- Thanks, Adele.

730
00:52:24,858 --> 00:52:27,122
How do they twinkle their toes,
then, if it's fake, mira?

731
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:32,992
First thing we do,
we get to Detroit, we find Glenn,

732
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:36,160
and we find a window
to throw him out of.

733
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,170
I was thinkin', if I was Glenn,
and I was up there...

734
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,229
to take down the Ripper,
where would I go?

735
00:52:40,307 --> 00:52:43,299
'Cept that if you were Glenn,
you wouldn't be thinkin'.

736
00:52:43,376 --> 00:52:45,435
Remember Snoopy Miller,
his old pal from the joint?

737
00:52:45,512 --> 00:52:48,276
Snoop? I figured
he'd be brain-dead by now.

738
00:52:48,348 --> 00:52:50,441
Nah, Snoop doesn't box anymore.

739
00:52:50,517 --> 00:52:53,350
Glenn told me that he's managing
some fighters out at the Kronk.

740
00:53:08,568 --> 00:53:11,128
- Did you get the key?
- They're in room 613.

741
00:53:13,907 --> 00:53:17,308
All right. I want
two men outside, front and back.

742
00:53:17,377 --> 00:53:22,076
Conroy, Jamison, go on up to six,
cover both ends of the hall.

743
00:53:23,316 --> 00:53:25,841
You're primary.
You're secondary.

744
00:53:25,919 --> 00:53:28,387
And you're point man.

745
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:32,152
- You gonna use a ram?
- Yeah. Why?

746
00:53:32,225 --> 00:53:34,420
The manager's door is metal.

747
00:53:34,494 --> 00:53:36,519
You know what I mean,
they might all be.

748
00:53:36,596 --> 00:53:39,895
A ram on a metal door makes
a lot of noise for what good it does.

749
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:42,833
I got a shock lock round
for my shotgun that oughta do the trick.

750
00:53:42,903 --> 00:53:44,837
Fine. Whatever.

751
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,416
Two, please.

752
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:01,653
You.

753
00:54:05,759 --> 00:54:09,957
Fuck it.
Let's take the stairs. Karen...

754
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:13,193
Take the radio. Stay down here
in the lobby and watch the elevator.

755
00:54:13,266 --> 00:54:17,100
- Daniel, I want to go upstairs.
- Well, you can wait
in the car if you want to.

756
00:54:18,772 --> 00:54:21,741
Now, you see Foley and Bragg
coming behind us. What do you do?

757
00:54:21,808 --> 00:54:25,744
- Call and tell you?
- And you let them come up.

758
00:54:25,812 --> 00:54:29,304
You don't try to make
the bust yourself. You understand?

759
00:54:35,488 --> 00:54:37,752
Is this your floor, ma'am?

760
00:54:38,992 --> 00:54:40,926
[Shouts]
Is this your floor, ma'am?

761
00:54:40,994 --> 00:54:43,895
Oh. Oh, yes.

762
00:54:43,964 --> 00:54:46,797
Yes, it is. I'm sorry. Thank you.

763
00:54:50,403 --> 00:54:53,634
Be advised we are
approaching the door.

764
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:05,874
Be advised we are
going to blow the door.

765
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,951
[Elevator Dings]

766
00:55:15,662 --> 00:55:17,596
Going up?

767
00:55:32,712 --> 00:55:35,044
Shit, I thought I was going up.

768
00:55:36,683 --> 00:55:39,584
She just looked right at me.

769
00:55:39,652 --> 00:55:42,849
- Who?
- Karen.

770
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:46,449
- Karen Sisco?
- Yeah.

771
00:55:46,526 --> 00:55:48,517
She's in the lobby.

772
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,529
- She's in the lobby?
- Yeah.

773
00:55:52,365 --> 00:55:55,664
They know where I live,
no doubt they know what I drive.
We gotta dump this car.

774
00:56:04,511 --> 00:56:06,706
She just sat there,
looking right at me.

775
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,714
[Engine Starts]

776
00:56:11,317 --> 00:56:15,276
[Daniel Over Radio] Karen, they're
not up here. Keep your eyes open.

777
00:56:16,356 --> 00:56:20,315
Karen? Karen, are you there?

778
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,561
He waved at you?

779
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,563
Couldn't swear to it,
but I'm pretty sure he did.

780
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,724
- Did you wave back?
- I didn't have time.

781
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,791
I imagine you would have, though.

782
00:56:30,336 --> 00:56:32,270
Buddy's sister, Regina Mary Bragg,

783
00:56:32,338 --> 00:56:34,272
got two calls from Buddy
in Detroit this morning.

784
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,808
She calls Burdon.
She's also the one who called Burdon...

785
00:56:36,876 --> 00:56:39,208
- and gave him Buddy's address.
- So?

786
00:56:39,279 --> 00:56:42,544
So what I want to know is why he still
calls her even after she turned him in.

787
00:56:42,615 --> 00:56:44,640
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.
What I want to know is why,

788
00:56:44,717 --> 00:56:49,552
they got such a big score up north, did
Foley hang around Miami for so long?

789
00:56:49,622 --> 00:56:52,614
- Any thoughts on that?
- None I'd like to share.

790
00:56:53,726 --> 00:56:56,388
- I'll call you when I get in.
- Okay.

791
00:57:03,536 --> 00:57:06,369
(music) Hey (music)

792
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:25,416
(music) Time is truly wasting (music)

793
00:57:25,492 --> 00:57:29,986
You know, I don't just deal product
and manage fighters no more.

794
00:57:30,063 --> 00:57:34,693
A lot's changed since the last time
you seen me, man. It's like I've, uh,

795
00:57:34,767 --> 00:57:37,531
vertically integrated myself,
you know, diversified and shit,

796
00:57:37,604 --> 00:57:39,595
and now I'm into
the occasional grand larceny,

797
00:57:39,672 --> 00:57:41,970
- home invasion, shit like that.
- Huh.

798
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,236
White Boy Bob right there's
my all-around man, you know.

799
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:49,338
He's my personal bodyguard when I feel
like I need one, driver, shit like that.

800
00:57:49,415 --> 00:57:51,940
Yo, man, watch the road, White Boy!
What you lookin' back here for?

801
00:57:52,018 --> 00:57:56,114
- [Laughs] Yeah.
- Yeah.

802
00:57:56,189 --> 00:57:58,123
- I like this car, Glenn.
- Yeah.

803
00:57:58,191 --> 00:58:00,284
You stole a good one, boy.

804
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:03,420
You can roll around
in Ripley's neighborhood
up there in Bloomfield Hills,

805
00:58:03,496 --> 00:58:05,430
not get sweated
by the private security.

806
00:58:05,498 --> 00:58:08,433
Ain't gonna have no police on our ass,
nothing like that. It's nice, man.

807
00:58:09,602 --> 00:58:11,536
Yeah.

808
00:58:11,604 --> 00:58:14,596
Oh, hey, so you still haven't said
how you want to do this thing.

809
00:58:14,674 --> 00:58:19,043
Oh, I'm gonna tell you that
as soon as we get one other
brother I'm gonna need, uh,

810
00:58:19,112 --> 00:58:21,046
Kenneth...
that's Moselle's brother...

811
00:58:21,114 --> 00:58:24,550
along with White Boy right there.

00:58:24,617 --> 00:58:26,551
- What?
- All right, here we go, White Boy.

Uh, who's the fireman?

816
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:46,229
- What's up, brother-in-law?
- What's happenin', hustler?

817
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:50,532
Hey, man. This cigarette
gonna bother you, Mo?

00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:54,637
Yeah, put that thing out, all right?
Ken, this is Glenn.

rip off that rich white dude?

- Yeah, that's him.
- [Laughs] Help you?

822
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:07,188
Go ahead, White Boy.

Um, whoa, wait a minute, um, look...

letting you in on this gig,

not...

- You just asked
how we gonna do it, right?
- Yeah.

827
00:59:25,044 --> 00:59:27,012
Well, I'm telling you how, man.
We the experts.

00:59:28,748 --> 00:59:30,682
Person I'm worried about
is you, Glenn.

829
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:33,480
- Me?
- Yeah.

830
00:59:33,553 --> 00:59:37,284
Can you step up and actually do this
shit instead of just talking the talk?

831
00:59:38,524 --> 00:59:40,719
Do what?

832
00:59:40,793 --> 00:59:43,159
Walk into this house
I got picked out.

833

Do this cross-dressing nigger
named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to.

- What? When, man?

Shit, right now, son.
What you think all this shit is for?

836
00:59:53,106 --> 00:59:56,166
I don't need to prove
shit to you, man, okay?

The Ripley job is my job.
You're either in or you're not.

I know you supposed to be
cool and everything, okay,

but you ain't got
to give me no tone of voice.

You don't like what I'm sayin',
you just bounce the fuck out
this whip anywhere up in here.

What do you think?

866
01:02:23,256 --> 01:02:26,851
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and
now we got ourselves another partner.

Snoopy Miller,
famous fight thrower.

Seems I read somewhere that you
broke out of a prison down in Florida.

- Is that right?
- They got a low class
of people there, Snoop.

put your head through the wall.

880
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:10,502
What? You mean "Snoop"?

881
01:03:12,004 --> 01:03:16,065
Nobody calls me Snoop or Snoopy
anymore is what White Boy Bob
is trying to tell you.

882
01:03:16,142 --> 01:03:18,508
He's just a little crude with it.
You know what I mean?

883
01:03:18,578 --> 01:03:20,808
Nah, I left all that
behind me, partner.

884
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,814
But you call this bozo
"White Boy."

885
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:26,010
White Boy Bob
used to be a fighter.

886
01:03:26,085 --> 01:03:28,918
Oh, so tell me, what do you
do now, White Boy Bob,

887
01:03:28,988 --> 01:03:30,922
outside of shoot
your big mouth off?

888
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:36,623
- Like being back in the yard, isn't it?
- Yeah, just like it.

889
01:03:36,696 --> 01:03:38,687
Nobody backing down
or nothing.

890
01:03:38,764 --> 01:03:42,097
- You back down, you just a pussy.
- [Laughs]

891
01:03:42,168 --> 01:03:45,797
- Why y'all in Detroit anyway,
up here in the cold?
- Glenn didn't tell you?

892
01:03:45,872 --> 01:03:49,672
- Glenn? What?
- I thought you guys were busted.

893
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:52,768
Why's that? 'Cause you left us
standing on the side of the road?

894
01:03:52,845 --> 01:03:54,972
Whoops.
[Laughs]

895
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:00,014
Look, Snoop, I don't know
what Glenn promised you,

896
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:02,748
or what you think you're going
to get out of this... here's the deal:

897
01:04:02,822 --> 01:04:05,791
Buddy and I, we're going to take half
of anything we get off of Ripley.

898
01:04:05,858 --> 01:04:07,849
Anything else, you guys are
allowed to cut up any way you want.

899
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,828
Oh. Why don't we talk
about this outside, man?

900
01:04:12,398 --> 01:04:16,630
- Nice in here. It's warm.
- Warm? It's like
90 degrees in here, man.

901
01:04:16,702 --> 01:04:18,897
Sometimes it's 100 up in this mug.

902
01:04:18,971 --> 01:04:21,064
That's the way Emmanuel
like to keep it.

903
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:23,506
Keep his fighters mean and lean like
Tommy Hearns. Ain't that right, Kenny?

904
01:04:23,576 --> 01:04:25,737
I got someplace to be anyway,
so tell you what:

905
01:04:25,811 --> 01:04:27,745
Why don't y'all come by
the fights Friday night?

906
01:04:27,813 --> 01:04:30,304
We'll sit down,
chop it up, you know, look it over.

907
01:04:30,383 --> 01:04:33,511
- State Theater.
- All right. We'll see you then.

908
01:04:42,995 --> 01:04:47,398
So it must take a lot of balls
to walk into a bank and
stick it up with a gun, huh?

909
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:50,060
I don't know. I never used
a gun before in my life.

910
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:52,070
You're kidding.

911
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:55,403
You'd be surprised what all you can get
if you ask for it the right way.

912
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:59,638
Well, you're the reason, my friend, that
I don't keep all my money in the bank.

913
01:04:59,712 --> 01:05:02,010
So where do you keep
your money, Dick?

914
01:05:02,081 --> 01:05:04,015
Talking about all those
uncut diamonds you told about.

915
01:05:04,083 --> 01:05:07,314
- I know what you're talking about.
- You're the one with balls.

916
01:05:07,386 --> 01:05:09,411
Say something like that
to somebody like Glenn?

917
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:12,252
Glenn? Come on, nobody's
going to believe Glenn.

918
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:14,793
- Do you believe Glenn?
- Uh, no, I don't.

919
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:17,852
Besides, even if it was true,
he'd still have to know
where I keep 'em, wouldn't he?

920
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:20,728
Doesn't have to know anything.
You told him you keep 'em in your house.

921
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:24,600
It's a very big house.
So, how much longer you in here for?

922
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:29,471
Uh, 22 months,
three days, two hours.

923
01:05:29,542 --> 01:05:33,410
- Why?
- 'Cause I could use a guy like you.

924
01:05:33,479 --> 01:05:36,642
Somebody that knows how to ask
for things in the right way.

925
01:05:36,716 --> 01:05:38,650
I'm talking about
when you're out of here.

926
01:05:38,718 --> 01:05:41,152
After all, you can't rob banks
forever, can you?

927
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:44,212
- I'm not exactly a nine to five type.
- Who is?

928
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:56,301
I thought everybody liked Eddie.

929
01:05:58,004 --> 01:06:02,304
- How you doin', Ray?
- I'm freezing.

930
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:04,809
But I'm getting warmer.

931
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:09,075
So listen, other than we had so much fun
the last time we worked together,

932
01:06:09,148 --> 01:06:11,548
you want to tell me why you're coming
to me instead of the F.B.I.?

933
01:06:11,617 --> 01:06:14,450
I go to the F.B.I.,
the first thing they're
gonna do is send me to get some coffee.

934
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,454
You know what?
You're right.

935
01:06:16,522 --> 01:06:19,980
Ray, about a year ago,
D.E.A. Had a guy, Glenn Michaels,
on possession with intent.

936
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:23,460
- Listen, is that your car?
Find out whose it is.
- They couldn't make it stick.

937
01:06:23,529 --> 01:06:26,521
In his statement, he said he was coming
to Detroit to see a friend...

938
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:28,590
about job opportunities,
if you can believe that.

939
01:06:28,668 --> 01:06:30,761
- What was the name of the friend?
- Maurice Miller,

940
01:06:30,836 --> 01:06:33,828
also known as Snoopy,
used to be a prizefighter.

941
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:36,500
I know Snoopy.
He's a fucking wack job.

942
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:38,907
He thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard,
hangs out over on the west side...

943
01:06:38,978 --> 01:06:41,776
with a couple of other
first-rate nut cases.

944
01:06:41,847 --> 01:06:44,111
- Well, I'm gonna need
a last known address.
- 2710 coming in.

945
01:06:44,183 --> 01:06:46,811
- You're gonna need what?
- A last known address.

946
01:06:47,887 --> 01:06:50,685
That your car?

947
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:53,748
No way. I don't want you
talking to Miller alone.

948
01:06:53,826 --> 01:06:58,024
Come on, Ray. I'm a federal officer.
I can handle myself. I'm armed.

949
01:07:00,366 --> 01:07:02,459
[Sighs] I'll call you tomorrow
with the address.

950
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:06,804
Thank you, Raymond.

951
01:07:06,872 --> 01:07:09,272
[Buddy]
You see the paper?

952
01:07:09,341 --> 01:07:11,639
- [Jack] It's a terrific shot of her.
- [Buddy] Outside of that.

953
01:07:11,711 --> 01:07:15,147
Doesn't say what she's doing here,
but I don't think it has
anything to do with us.

954
01:07:15,214 --> 01:07:17,739
She came up here on her vacation
because she likes shitty weather.

955
01:07:17,817 --> 01:07:19,751
Nah, I think she's after Glenn.

956
01:07:19,819 --> 01:07:21,912
The girl still there?

957
01:07:21,987 --> 01:07:25,150
They don't stay the whole night, Jack,
unless you pay for it.

958
01:07:25,224 --> 01:07:29,888
- Did you tell your sister?
- Yeah, I just hung up.
She prayed for me.

959
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:33,329
- Mm-hmm. And how long were you
on the phone with her?
- Two hours.

960
01:07:33,399 --> 01:07:37,165
- And how long were you with the girl?
- 45 minutes.

961
01:07:37,236 --> 01:07:39,170
You didn't tell your sister
about Ripley, did you?

962
01:07:39,238 --> 01:07:41,638
Look, Jack, just forget
about my sister, okay?

963
01:07:41,707 --> 01:07:44,608
Now, if Karen Sisco is
tailing Glenn, we're fucked.

964
01:07:44,677 --> 01:07:46,736
Tomorrow night at the fights,
we all get picked up.

965
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:50,373
Why don't we just drive by where
we're meeting tonight, check it out.

966
01:07:50,449 --> 01:07:52,383
And we'll go by Ripley's too,
while we're at it.

967
01:07:52,451 --> 01:07:54,783
- Yeah, all right.
- All right.

968
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:07,026
- Athenaeum Hotel, how may I help you?
- Karen Sisco, please.

969
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,431
- Hello, Best Western.
- Karen Sisco, please.

970
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:18,041
- Moselle Miller?
- What do you want?

971
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:22,206
- I'm looking for Maurice.
- You find him, tell him
the dog got run over.

972
01:08:22,281 --> 01:08:24,249
I'm out of grocery money.

973
01:08:24,316 --> 01:08:27,581
- Moselle, who you talkin' to?
- Lady lookin' for Maurice.

974
01:08:27,653 --> 01:08:29,712
- What does she want?
- Hasn't said.

975
01:08:29,789 --> 01:08:33,247
- That's not Maurice?
- That's Kenneth, my brother.
He's talkin' on the phone.

976
01:08:33,325 --> 01:08:36,055
- Ask her what she want with him!
- You ask her!

977
01:08:36,128 --> 01:08:39,154
- Maurice business
is none of my business.
- Yeah, you damn right.

978
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:43,095
State Theater, huh?
Who's fightin'?

979
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:47,100
Nigger, what?
[Laughs]

980
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:52,438
I'm looking for somebody
I think Maurice knows.

981
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:56,408
You're not with probation,
one of those?

982
01:08:56,482 --> 01:08:59,713
- No.
- You a lawyer?

983
01:08:59,785 --> 01:09:02,913
No, I'm not. I'm looking
for somebody named Glenn Michaels.

984
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:07,855
Glenn? I don't know any Glenn.

985
01:09:07,927 --> 01:09:09,918
He said he stayed here
last November.

986
01:09:09,995 --> 01:09:12,759
- Here in this house?
- He said he stayed with Maurice.

987
01:09:12,832 --> 01:09:16,393
Well, he ain't
even here that much.

988
01:09:16,468 --> 01:09:18,333
I'd like to know where he goes,
but at the same time,

989
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:21,271
I don't wanna know,
you understand?

990
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:24,275
Yeah.

991
01:09:24,343 --> 01:09:28,006
- You say your dog was killed?
- Got run over by a car.

992
01:09:29,281 --> 01:09:33,274
- What'd you call him?
- Was a she. Named Tuffy.

993
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:38,284
Where do you think
I might find Maurice, Moselle?

994
01:09:38,357 --> 01:09:41,258
I don't know.
The gym, the fights.

995
01:09:41,327 --> 01:09:45,423
I know he don't miss the fights.
They're havin' some tomorrow
down at the State Theater.

996
01:09:45,497 --> 01:09:47,829
- He used to take me.
- The State Theater.

997
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:50,164
Why you askin'
all these questions about Maurice?

998
01:09:50,236 --> 01:09:52,227
She lookin' for a man name of Glenn.

999
01:09:52,304 --> 01:09:55,467
Did I ask you? Go on and do something
with yourself, Moselle.

1000
01:09:55,541 --> 01:09:59,500
Why don't you take your ass
to Dot and Etta's and get us
some shrimp or somethin'?

1001
01:10:09,255 --> 01:10:11,746
- You're a fighter.
- How you know that?

1002
01:10:11,824 --> 01:10:14,952
- I can tell.
- Yeah, I was.

1003
01:10:16,562 --> 01:10:18,996
'Til I got my retina
detached two times.

1004
01:10:20,666 --> 01:10:24,602
- What'd you fight, about middleweight?
- Nah, light.

1005
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:27,696
Super middleweight,
once my body developed.

1006
01:10:29,041 --> 01:10:32,738
- What you go about, what, a bantam?
- Flyweight.

1007
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:37,305
[Laughs] Nigger, what?
You know your divisions, huh?

1008
01:10:37,383 --> 01:10:40,682
Do you like the fights?
You like the rough stuff?

1009
01:10:40,753 --> 01:10:43,551
Yeah, I bet you do.

1010
01:10:43,622 --> 01:10:46,022
You like to get down
and tussle a little bit?

1011
01:10:46,091 --> 01:10:49,356
Like me and Tuffy,
before she got run over.

1012
01:10:49,428 --> 01:10:51,726
We used to get down on the floor
and tussle all the time.

1013
01:10:51,797 --> 01:10:57,633
I'd say to her, "You a good bitch,
Tuffy. Here's a treat for ya."

1014
01:10:57,703 --> 01:11:02,367
And I give Tuffy what all good bitches
love best, and you know what that is?

1015
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:08,037
Know what that is? A bone.

1016
01:11:08,113 --> 01:11:10,343
I'll give you
a good bone too, girl.

1017
01:11:10,416 --> 01:11:12,384
- You're not my type.
- [Laughs]

1018
01:11:12,451 --> 01:11:15,113
No, that shit
don't mean nothin' to me.

1019
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:18,816
- I let the monster out,
you gonna do what it wants.
- I gotta go, Kenneth.

1020
01:11:18,891 --> 01:11:21,223
- Maybe we'll see each other again.
- No, no, we gonna tussle first.

1021
01:11:22,628 --> 01:11:24,789
Awww!
[Grunts]

1022
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:27,730
Damn it!
What the fuck was that?

1023
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:31,463
You wanted to tussle.
We tussled.

1024
01:11:32,671 --> 01:11:36,732
[Sips]
That's a big ass house.

1025
01:11:36,809 --> 01:11:38,743
Place almost looks
like a prison.

1026
01:11:38,811 --> 01:11:41,109
No doubt he's got some
serious security system.

1027
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:44,274
Time comes, we go up, knock on the door,
see if he wants to talk about old times.

1028
01:11:44,350 --> 01:11:47,080
- You know, the easy way.
- Cool.

1029
01:11:47,152 --> 01:11:50,918
Think he'll let us in, we got the Snoop
and that musclebound asshole with us?

1030
01:11:50,990 --> 01:11:52,924
Nobody's gonna be with us.

1031
01:11:52,992 --> 01:11:55,688
I say we go to the fights tomorrow
night, see what Snoopy's big plan is,

1032
01:11:55,761 --> 01:11:59,162
then we go in,
ahead of him, alone.

1033
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:01,165
Oh, I can dig it.

1034
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:03,963
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop,
while we off livin' the good life.

1035
01:12:04,036 --> 01:12:06,527
Good life. Buddy, you know anybody
who's done one last big score...

1036
01:12:06,605 --> 01:12:08,539
and then gone on
to live the good life?

1037
01:12:08,607 --> 01:12:11,735
Look, Jack, there's a chance
we'll walk out of here with nothin'.

1038
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:13,801
I say,
let fate decide.

1039
01:12:13,879 --> 01:12:16,712
Let fate decide? What are you,
the fuckin' Dalai Lama now?

1040
01:12:16,782 --> 01:12:18,716
Nah, man,
it's my sister.

1041
01:12:18,784 --> 01:12:20,979
My sister believes
in fate but not hell.

1042
01:12:21,053 --> 01:12:23,112
That's why she stopped praying
for all the lost souls,

1043
01:12:23,188 --> 01:12:25,349
since you don't hear that much
about purgatory anymore.

1044
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:28,791
But every day, she asks her boss
to pray that Buddy don't fuck up.

1045
01:12:28,861 --> 01:12:31,455
- [Chuckles]
- I mean, what do you think?

1046
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:33,998
- Well...
- You think there's a hell?

1047
01:12:34,066 --> 01:12:36,933
Yeah, it's called
the Glades Correctional Institute.

1048
01:12:37,002 --> 01:12:39,402
I'm sure as shit not going back there
or any place like it.

1049
01:12:39,471 --> 01:12:41,803
They put a gun on you,
you'll go, brother.

1050
01:12:43,509 --> 01:12:46,501
They put a gun on you,
you still have a choice.

1051
01:12:48,881 --> 01:12:52,874
So, Mr. Foley,

1052
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:57,513
Mr. Ripley and I have
had a long discussion
about your role in the company,

1053
01:12:57,589 --> 01:13:00,183
and it was his feeling you'd be
happiest working down here in Miami.

1054
01:13:00,259 --> 01:13:02,853
- How's that sound to you?
- Sounds great.

1055
01:13:02,928 --> 01:13:06,193
Good. You're about
a 42 long, right?

1056
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:12,400
I uh, I'm about a 42...

1057
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:14,405
like, 42 regular.

1058
01:13:22,414 --> 01:13:24,609
- Okay, let's see how she fits.
- What is that?

1059
01:13:24,683 --> 01:13:26,617
Your uniform.

1060
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:30,755
My uniform.

1061
01:13:32,124 --> 01:13:34,115
Mr. Foley. Mr. Foley!

1062
01:13:35,294 --> 01:13:37,455
Sir, sir. Excuse me, sir.

1063
01:13:37,529 --> 01:13:39,895
Sir! Sir, excuse me!

1064
01:13:39,965 --> 01:13:42,024
- You can't go in there!
- Are you fucking kidding me?
A security guard?

1065
01:13:42,101 --> 01:13:44,695
- What are you, stoned?
- Hey, hey! Take it easy!

1066
01:13:44,770 --> 01:13:46,704
It's all right, Peggy.
It's under control.

1067
01:13:49,141 --> 01:13:51,371
[Sighs]
You know something?

1068
01:13:51,443 --> 01:13:54,412
I wasn't sure that you'd show up here,
but I was very sure if you did,

1069
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:57,108
you'd throw this job
in my face.

1070
01:13:57,182 --> 01:13:59,116
Let me tell you
something.

1071
01:13:59,184 --> 01:14:02,642
Every single thing you've done
with your life up until this point...

1072
01:14:02,721 --> 01:14:05,155
in the real world
means nothing.

1073
01:14:05,224 --> 01:14:07,158
Less than nothing.

1074
01:14:07,226 --> 01:14:09,285
You're a bank robber.

1075
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:12,091
That's not
a very marketable skill.

1076
01:14:12,164 --> 01:14:14,894
We don't see a lot
of old bank robbers walking around...

1077
01:14:14,967 --> 01:14:17,902
with a pension plan,
now do we?

1078
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:19,938
I think you know this.
That's why you're here.

1079
01:14:20,005 --> 01:14:22,735
[Sighs]
Today, I've offered you...

1080
01:14:22,808 --> 01:14:26,073
a lousy job with a lousy wage.

1081
01:14:26,145 --> 01:14:30,241
You want something better?
Why don't you show me you can change?

1082
01:14:30,315 --> 01:14:33,512
Then I'll offer you
something better, a lot better.

1083
01:14:33,585 --> 01:14:37,077
But until then, my friend,
you'll have to earn it.

1084
01:14:38,490 --> 01:14:40,424
How, Dick?
The way you earn it?

1085
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,585
Married some rich broad
owns the company,

1086
01:14:43,662 --> 01:14:45,687
selling it off a piece at a time
then divorcing her?

1087
01:14:45,764 --> 01:14:50,167
What's this Knute Rockne "pull yourself
up by the bootstraps" bullshit?

1088
01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:53,432
Back in prison, a guy like you
in a place like that?

1089
01:14:53,505 --> 01:14:56,804
You were ice cream for freaks.
A goddamned dumpling.

1090
01:14:56,875 --> 01:15:00,367
Maurice and a dozen other guys would
have bled you till you had nothing.

1091
01:15:00,445 --> 01:15:03,608
Until you were nothing.
I saved your ass!

1092
01:15:03,682 --> 01:15:06,173
So you'll pardon me if I don't want
to sit on a fucking stool all day,

1093
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:09,448
and say, "Sign in here, please,"
or "Hey, pal, you can't park here."

1094
01:15:09,521 --> 01:15:12,684
All right, Dick?
I can't fuckin' do it, Dick!

1095
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:14,726
- I'm disappointed in you.
- You wanna...

1096
01:15:14,793 --> 01:15:17,353
Oh, here we go.
What job did he promise you boys?

1097
01:15:17,429 --> 01:15:19,989
- There's two ways we can do this.
- Yeah, what are they?

1098
01:16:04,576 --> 01:16:08,706
Hey, Buddy, I gotta get a better pair
of shoes and some things for tomorrow.

1099
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:10,714
Drop me off by the Ren Center
and we'll hook up later?

1100
01:16:10,782 --> 01:16:13,649
Yeah, okay.

1101
01:16:13,719 --> 01:16:15,380
I better go call my sister.

1102
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:21,091
(music) [Soft Jazz Piano]

1103
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:33,697
[Woman]
Can I get you anything?

1104
01:16:33,772 --> 01:16:36,138
Yeah, I'll have a bourbon, please.
Water back.

1105
01:16:36,208 --> 01:16:38,142
Okay.

1106
01:16:40,579 --> 01:16:43,707
Hey, Tad, why don't
you do us again, please?

1107
01:16:43,782 --> 01:16:46,979
Oh, and, Celeste,
put the lady's drink on our bill.

1108
01:16:48,587 --> 01:16:50,748
[Soft Chattering]

1109
01:16:58,230 --> 01:17:01,461
- They want to buy your drink for you.
- Yeah, I get that.

1110
01:17:01,533 --> 01:17:03,899
- Tell them I'd rather pay for my own.
- Okay.

1111
01:17:08,674 --> 01:17:10,608
I'll find out.

1112
01:17:14,246 --> 01:17:16,237
Excuse me.

1113
01:17:16,315 --> 01:17:18,783
My associates and I,
we made a little bet...

1114
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:20,818
on what you do
for a living.

1115
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:23,855
And I won.
Hi, I'm Phillip.

1116
01:17:23,922 --> 01:17:27,619
If it's okay with you,
Phillip, I'd rather just
have a quiet drink and leave.

1117
01:17:27,693 --> 01:17:31,595
Don't you want to know what I guessed?
How I know what you do for a living?

1118
01:17:31,663 --> 01:17:34,791
Really, Phillip, I don't want to be
rude. I just want to be left alone.

1119
01:17:41,373 --> 01:17:43,807
[Chuckles]
It's a little cold over there.

[Clears Throat]

1121
01:17:50,315 --> 01:17:52,806
Excuse me.
I think I know why you're depressed.

1122
01:17:52,884 --> 01:17:56,115
If I can offer
my observation.

1123
01:17:57,289 --> 01:18:00,452
See, I got a hunch
you're the new sales rep,

1124
01:18:00,525 --> 01:18:05,724
and the client's not exactly knocked out
by the fact that a young lady...

1125
01:18:05,797 --> 01:18:10,063
even one as stunning as yourself...
is handling the account.

1126
01:18:10,135 --> 01:18:13,036
Am I close?

I'm Andy.

We're all ad guys. Flew in this morning
from the apple... New York.

Came in to pitch
Hiram Walker Distillery.

1130
01:18:25,317 --> 01:18:28,343
Little test market campaign
for the new margarita mix.

1131
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:32,550
It's really pretty interesting.
We take this, um,

1132
01:18:32,624 --> 01:18:35,184
Mex... um,
Hispanic bandito...

1133

with his bullet belts and everything,
and the big Chihuahua hat,

1134
01:18:38,897 --> 01:18:41,695
and he pulls out
his six-guns,

1135
01:18:41,767 --> 01:18:45,294
- and these guys back here...
- Andy.

01:18:45,370 --> 01:18:47,497
Really.
Who gives a shit?

01:18:47,572 --> 01:18:52,509
- Do you want to tell me what happened?
- Beat it, Andy.

01:19:01,286 --> 01:19:03,220
Andy.

1139

What'd you do?
[Laughs]

1140
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:21,265
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Yeah, I'd love one.

1141
01:19:23,375 --> 01:19:25,741
Sit down.

1142
01:19:38,290 --> 01:19:40,224

I'm Celeste.

1144
01:19:46,231 --> 01:19:49,132
- It takes forever to get a drink.
There's only one waitress.
- I can go to the bar.

1145
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:51,567
- Oh, don't go.
- Are those guys bothering you?

1146
01:19:51,636 --> 01:19:53,604
No, they're fine.
I mean, you just got here.

1147
01:19:58,076 --> 01:20:00,010
Here, help yourself.

1148
01:20:01,913 --> 01:20:04,438
- You like bourbon?
- I love it.

1149
01:20:04,516 --> 01:20:07,952
We got that out of the way. Tell me,
Celeste, what do you do for a living?

1150
01:20:08,019 --> 01:20:11,614
I'm a sales rep,
and I came here to call on a customer,

1151
01:20:11,690 --> 01:20:13,817
but they gave me a hard time
'cause I'm a girl.

1152
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:15,826
Is that how
you think of yourself?

1153
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:17,828
- As a sales rep?
- As a girl.

1154
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:19,887
- Yeah, I don't have a problem with it.
- I like your hair.

1155
01:20:19,965 --> 01:20:23,924
- I like your outfit.
- Actually, this is
my second favorite outfit.

1156
01:20:24,002 --> 01:20:27,335
I had a first favorite, but it got
ruined and I had to get rid of it.

1157
01:20:27,405 --> 01:20:29,339
- You did?
- It smelled.

1158
01:20:29,407 --> 01:20:31,932
- Really? Having it
cleaned didn't help?
- No.

1159
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:33,944
So tell me, Gary,
what do you do for a living?

1160
01:20:34,012 --> 01:20:37,004
- How far do you want
to go with this?
- Don't say anything yet.

1161
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:39,482
I don't think it works
if we're somebody else.

1162
01:20:39,551 --> 01:20:41,485
I mean, Gary and Celeste,
what do they know about anything?

1163
01:20:41,553 --> 01:20:44,113
- Well, this is your game,
I've never played before.
- It's not a game.

1164
01:20:44,189 --> 01:20:46,350
It's not something you play.

1165
01:20:46,424 --> 01:20:48,415
Well, does this make
any sense to you?

1166
01:20:48,493 --> 01:20:50,825
It doesn't have to.
It's something that happens.

1167
01:20:50,896 --> 01:20:55,959
It's like seeing
someone for the first time...
like you could be passing on the street,

1168
01:20:56,034 --> 01:20:59,299
and you look at each other
and for a few seconds...

1169
01:20:59,371 --> 01:21:02,807
there's this kind of a recognition...
like you both know something.

1170
01:21:02,874 --> 01:21:05,741
The next moment,
the person's gone,

1171
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:09,211
and it's too late
to do anything about it.

1172
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:12,114
And you always remember it,
because it was there, and you let it go,

1173
01:21:12,183 --> 01:21:15,550
and you think to yourself,
"What if I had stopped?
If I had said something?"

1174
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:17,554
"What if?"

1175
01:21:17,622 --> 01:21:19,590
"What if?"

1176
01:21:19,658 --> 01:21:23,719
And it may only happen
a few times in your life.

1177
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:29,365
- Or once.
- Or once.

1178
01:22:05,503 --> 01:22:08,063
[Karen]
How'd you find me?

1179
01:22:08,139 --> 01:22:10,073
Uh...

1180
01:22:11,843 --> 01:22:14,141
Called your room
from downstairs.

1181
01:22:14,212 --> 01:22:16,646
Oh.
[Laughs]

1182
01:22:17,983 --> 01:22:19,974
And if I had answered,
what were you gonna say?

1183
01:22:20,051 --> 01:22:24,420
I would say who I was,
and do you remember me,
and want to meet for a drink?

1184
01:22:24,489 --> 01:22:29,426
If I remembered you.
I came here looking for you.

1185
01:22:29,494 --> 01:22:32,258
All right, so then I would have
said yes, but for all you know,

1186
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:34,764
I could have had a SWAT team waiting
for you... why would you trust me?

1187
01:22:34,833 --> 01:22:36,824
It'd be worth the risk.

1188
01:22:36,901 --> 01:22:39,426
- You like taking risks.
- So do you.

1189
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:44,072
[Karen]
You know, sooner or later...

1190
01:22:47,646 --> 01:22:50,979
You really wear that suit.

1191
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:53,609
Well, that's not
what you were about to say.

1192
01:22:53,685 --> 01:22:56,586
- Remember how talkative
you were in the trunk?
- Mm-hmm.

1193
01:22:56,655 --> 01:22:59,522
- Adele said you do that
when you're nervous.
- Oh, she did, did she?

1194
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:05,155
- You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
- But in a nice way.

1195
01:23:24,449 --> 01:23:27,475
You know, that Sig
you took from me was special.

1196
01:23:27,552 --> 01:23:29,520
My dad gave it to me
for my birthday.

1197
01:23:29,587 --> 01:23:31,487
Yeah?

1198
01:23:31,556 --> 01:23:33,649
What were you going
to do with me?

1199
01:23:33,725 --> 01:23:36,250
I hadn't really worked
that part out yet.

1200
01:23:36,327 --> 01:23:38,522
All I knew is that I liked you,
and that I didn't wanna...

1201
01:23:38,596 --> 01:23:40,791
leave you there on the side of the road
and never see you again.

1202
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:44,402
Then you waved to me
in that elevator.

1203
01:23:44,469 --> 01:23:47,370
- Yeah, I wasn't sure if you caught that.
- [Laughs]

1204
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:50,465
I couldn't believe it.
By that time I had been...

1205
01:23:50,542 --> 01:23:52,772
thinking about you a lot...

1206
01:23:52,844 --> 01:23:56,302
and just wondering
what it would be like if we met,

1207
01:23:56,381 --> 01:23:59,407
if we could take a time-out.

1208
01:23:59,484 --> 01:24:01,850
I was thinking the same thing.

1209
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,787
I kept thinking,
"What if we took a time-out?"

1210
01:24:04,856 --> 01:24:08,724
If we... just spent
some time together.

1211
01:24:13,565 --> 01:24:15,499
- You know, I saw you on the street.
- Where?

1212
01:24:15,567 --> 01:24:18,058
Outside Adele's.

1213
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:21,003
- You went to see her?
- To warn her about Chino.

1214
01:24:21,072 --> 01:24:24,303
- So she did help you.
- I don't think we should get into that.

1215
01:24:24,375 --> 01:24:26,434
You're right.
And I won't ask about Buddy,

1216
01:24:26,511 --> 01:24:32,040
or what you guys are doing
in Detroit, or if you've run
into Glenn Michaels yet...

1217
01:24:32,117 --> 01:24:34,950
Okay, now, don't talk like that,
because you scare me.

1218
01:24:46,631 --> 01:24:49,600
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.

1219
01:25:43,955 --> 01:25:46,583
There's something
I want you to know.

1220
01:25:46,658 --> 01:25:48,922
I wasn't just looking for a fuck,
if that's what you're thinking.

1221
01:25:48,993 --> 01:25:51,621
- Or, I was...
- Why are you mad?

1222
01:25:51,696 --> 01:25:55,291
I was looking for some kinky thrill...
you know, score with the bank robber.

1223
01:25:55,366 --> 01:25:58,130
- The way some women go for rough trade...
- All right.

1224
01:25:58,203 --> 01:26:02,196
Now I can say that I fucked
a U.S. Marshal. Do you think I will?

1225
01:26:02,273 --> 01:26:04,503
I don't know.

1226
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:06,510
Mm-hmm.

1227
01:26:08,112 --> 01:26:10,046
Come here.

1228
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:24,895
I know a guy...

1229
01:26:24,963 --> 01:26:28,057
walks into a bank with a bottle,
tells everybody it's nitroglycerine.

1230
01:26:28,132 --> 01:26:30,726
He scores some cash
off of the teller.

1231
01:26:30,802 --> 01:26:34,101
On his way out, he drops the bottle.
It cracks on the floor.

1232
01:26:34,172 --> 01:26:37,801
He slips in it. He smacks up
his head. They get him.

1233
01:26:37,876 --> 01:26:41,573
The nitroglycerine
was canola oil.

1234
01:26:41,646 --> 01:26:45,377
I know more fucked-up bank robbers
than ones that know what they're doing.

1235
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:49,614
I doubt one in ten could tell you
where the dye pack is.

1236
01:26:49,687 --> 01:26:52,212
Most bank robbers
are fucking morons.

1237
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:56,727
For you to go to bed with one
for kinky thrills,

1238
01:26:56,794 --> 01:27:00,127
like you were saying,
makes you as dumb as they are.

1239
01:27:00,198 --> 01:27:02,132
Now, you are not dumb.

1240
01:27:04,002 --> 01:27:08,701
Why would you think that? Why would
you think that I would think that?

1241
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:13,878
You're not dumb.

1242
01:27:15,713 --> 01:27:17,874
Well, I don't know about that.
[Laughs]

1243
01:27:17,949 --> 01:27:21,043
I mean, you can't do three falls
and think you have much of a brain.

1244
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:24,454
Come here.

1245
01:27:42,106 --> 01:27:44,301
You're getting
serious on me now.

1246
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:49,540
Tryin' not to.

1247
01:27:52,617 --> 01:27:55,017
I just want to know
what's gonna happen.

1248
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:04,094
You know.

1249
01:28:53,945 --> 01:28:56,277
Put it together now. Put it together!
Upstairs and downstairs.

1250
01:28:56,347 --> 01:28:59,316
- He don't want
to see you downstairs!
- Man, you drink like a bitch!

1251
01:29:01,085 --> 01:29:03,645
He don't want to see you... Get your
tussle on. Joe, get your tussle on!

1252
01:29:03,721 --> 01:29:06,053
Yeah, don't let him
out that corner.

1253
01:29:06,124 --> 01:29:08,319
Don't let him out, now.

1254
01:29:10,928 --> 01:29:14,386
Hey, you know what?
I gotta go take a pee.

1255
01:29:14,465 --> 01:29:18,367
What are you tellin' us for?
You want somebody to hold your pecker?

1256
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:21,799
Do that work, Joe!

1257
01:29:21,873 --> 01:29:23,807
Put it together now, Joe!

1258
01:29:23,875 --> 01:29:26,400
That's it, baby!

1259
01:29:26,477 --> 01:29:30,140
Take him deep!
Oh, oh, my God, I love it.

1260
01:29:30,214 --> 01:29:32,375
Put him to sleep, Joe!
Put him to sleep, Joe!

1261
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:35,317
Sit down, Kenny.
That's it! That's it!

1262
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:15,953
- You tryin' to steal this car, Glenn?
- Don't, don't, don't!

1263
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:19,596
Oh, my God,
I can't believe this!

1264
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:23,896
Another one of those days, huh?
Nothing seems to be going right.

1265
01:30:23,968 --> 01:30:25,959
- I don't have the keys to the car.
- I see that.

1266
01:30:26,037 --> 01:30:28,904
No, I mean I am not
fucking stealing the car!

1267
01:30:28,973 --> 01:30:32,966
- You're not?
- No, I already stole it a week ago,

1268
01:30:33,044 --> 01:30:35,478
whenever it was,
in West Palm.

1269
01:30:35,546 --> 01:30:37,537
So I can't be
stealing it again, can I?

1270
01:30:37,615 --> 01:30:40,311
- Put your hands on the wheel, please.
- Okay, so now you're gonna...

1271
01:30:40,384 --> 01:30:42,750
bust me for pickin' up
a car, what the...

1272
01:30:42,820 --> 01:30:45,311
For the car, for aiding
and abetting a prison escape,

1273
01:30:45,389 --> 01:30:48,552
and for conspiring to do
whatever you came here for.

1274
01:30:48,626 --> 01:30:51,595
Listen to me. These guys, they're gonna
be out here any minute looking for me,

1275
01:30:51,662 --> 01:30:54,961
and they're
fucking animals, man.

1276
01:30:57,201 --> 01:30:59,362
What's going on, Glenn?

1277
01:30:59,437 --> 01:31:02,099
Nothing. I just wanna
get the fuck outta here.

1278
01:31:02,173 --> 01:31:04,573
I thought this whole thing
was your idea.

1279
01:31:04,642 --> 01:31:06,735
Okay, ripping off Ripley
was my idea,

1280
01:31:06,811 --> 01:31:10,542
but these guys, they are
in a whole other level of their own.

1281
01:31:10,615 --> 01:31:13,675
- Ripley, the Wall Street guy?
- Yeah, the plan was...

1282
01:31:13,751 --> 01:31:15,719
to pick him up
at his office tomorrow...

1283
01:31:15,786 --> 01:31:18,687
and drive him out
to his house in Bloomfield Hills.

1284
01:31:18,756 --> 01:31:22,214
And now I don't give a shit
what the guys do, you know?

1285
01:31:22,293 --> 01:31:25,785
- And Foley was part of this.
- Yeah, he's supposed to be,
but he hasn't showed up yet,

1286
01:31:25,863 --> 01:31:28,024
- which is good for him.
- Why?

1287
01:31:28,099 --> 01:31:31,830
Because Maurice is
gonna kill him.

1288
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:34,838
Like, try to collect
the reward money or something.

1289
01:31:34,906 --> 01:31:37,875
But you say he hasn't shown up yet.
You think he backed out?

1290
01:31:37,942 --> 01:31:40,911
I don't know.
He doesn't exactly confide in me.

1291
01:31:41,979 --> 01:31:44,072
I wonder why.

1292
01:31:44,148 --> 01:31:47,675
Okay, if you're gonna do this,
let's do it and get out of here.

1293
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:50,186
I am freezing
my ass off!

1294
01:31:50,254 --> 01:31:52,745
If you wanna get out of here, run.
It'll warm you up.

1295
01:31:52,823 --> 01:31:54,757
Oh, ha, ha.

1296
01:31:59,997 --> 01:32:02,693
Really?

1297
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:06,225
I swear to God, Glenn, if I find out
that you are lying to me, l...

1298
01:32:06,304 --> 01:32:08,295
I know, you will find me.
I believe it.

1299
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:17,108
Hey, know what
I was thinkin'?

1300
01:32:17,181 --> 01:32:20,150
If you didn't drive me
to the federal court last summer,

1301
01:32:20,218 --> 01:32:22,152
you wouldn't even
know who I am.

1302
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:27,317
If I didn't know you, Glenn,
by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.

1303
01:32:27,391 --> 01:32:29,951
Think of it that way.
Now run.

1304
01:32:37,802 --> 01:32:39,736
Yeah! Yeah!

1305
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:45,468
I'm tellin' you,
man, the money is here.

1306
01:32:45,543 --> 01:32:48,774
- Snoop.
- Hey, it's the bank robbers.

1307
01:32:48,846 --> 01:32:50,814
Y'all missin' the fights, man.
Pull up a chair.

1308
01:32:50,881 --> 01:32:53,349
- Who's sittin' here?
- Oh, that's your homey, Glenn, man.

1309
01:32:53,417 --> 01:32:55,351
But he bounced to the bathroom
a couple minutes ago...

1310
01:32:55,419 --> 01:32:57,478
- and we ain't seen him since.
- Must've fell in, man.

1311
01:32:57,555 --> 01:32:59,523
No doubt.

1312
01:32:59,590 --> 01:33:02,081
Yeah, sent these two looking for him.
They came back shaking their heads.

1313
01:33:03,594 --> 01:33:06,188
Well, if he left his coat
and he's been gone a while, then...

1314
01:33:06,264 --> 01:33:08,357
- Car's here, man. I checked.
- Yeah.

1315
01:33:08,432 --> 01:33:11,697
- All right. We're leavin'.
- Leavin'?

1316
01:33:11,769 --> 01:33:13,760
- What the fuck, Foley?
- Stupid, you know where Glenn is.

1317
01:33:13,838 --> 01:33:16,966
- Look, what you worried
about Glenn for, what he know?
- I thought everything.

1318
01:33:17,041 --> 01:33:20,169
No, Glenn know everything
that's supposed to happen tomorrow.

1319
01:33:20,244 --> 01:33:23,839
Now, he may run and tell somebody that,
but that don't mean shit.

1320
01:33:23,914 --> 01:33:26,508
Glenn don't know
I changed the plan.

1321
01:33:26,584 --> 01:33:29,553
It's happenin' tonight.
Soon as we leave here.

1322
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:32,885
Go back by the house, pick up some shit
we gonna need, and we just gonna do it.

1323
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:42,526
- Give me a minute to talk to Buddy.
- You got two minutes, that's all.

1324
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:45,228
- Make up your mind, Foley.
- I wasn't asking permission.

1325
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:58,345
- You know they're gonna set us up.
- I get that feeling, yeah.

1326
01:33:58,416 --> 01:34:00,850
You think you can get
to the diamonds before they do?

1327
01:34:02,953 --> 01:34:06,616
I'll make you a deal.
You get outta here right now.

1328
01:34:06,691 --> 01:34:10,024
I'll do the job with Snoop. I'll meet
you anywhere you want, give you half.

1329
01:34:10,094 --> 01:34:13,894
- Half for doin' what?
- Gettin' me out of Glades, for starters.

1330
01:34:15,166 --> 01:34:17,691
Who's gonna watch
your back?

1331
01:36:00,738 --> 01:36:03,104
All right, White Boy.
House call.

1332
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:17,849
[Kenny]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1333
01:36:21,125 --> 01:36:23,059
[Doorbell Dings]

1334
01:36:25,296 --> 01:36:27,730
- Ready to do this, baby?
- Ready for whatever.

1335
01:36:27,798 --> 01:36:30,733
Cool. My shit always work.

1336
01:36:32,369 --> 01:36:35,133
Perennial Plumbing.

1337
01:36:36,407 --> 01:36:39,171
Somebody in the house called.

1338
01:36:39,243 --> 01:36:42,644
You don't know what you're talking
about, because no one was here.

1339
01:36:42,713 --> 01:36:45,204
- Let's go skiing.
- [Kenny] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1340
01:36:48,953 --> 01:36:50,887
You still got time
to take me up on my offer.

1341
01:36:50,955 --> 01:36:53,583
And leave you alone
with these assholes?

1342
01:36:55,759 --> 01:36:59,627
- Raymond Cruz.
- Ray, it's Karen Sisco.
I'm at Ripley's house.

1343
01:36:59,697 --> 01:37:02,325
I just saw Maurice Miller and four other
suspects force their way into the house.

1344
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:04,333
They're armed.
I'm gonna need backup.

1345
01:37:04,635 --> 01:37:06,762
- Who are you?
- I work here.

1346
01:37:06,837 --> 01:37:08,930
I'm the maid. Fuck off!

1347
01:37:09,006 --> 01:37:12,203
- That's exactly what I'm gonna do:
Fuck you, then off you.
- Hey, not yet.

1348
01:37:12,276 --> 01:37:15,712
- Where Ripley at?
- He isn't here.

1349
01:37:15,779 --> 01:37:20,341
- Out for the evening or some shit?
- He's in Florida... Palm Beach.

1350
01:37:20,417 --> 01:37:24,217
- When's he due back?
- What difference does it make?
You gonna wait for him?

1351
01:37:24,288 --> 01:37:28,850
Mr. Ripley's down for the season.
Christmas to Easter.

1352
01:37:28,926 --> 01:37:31,918
Stop that shit, man.

1353
01:37:31,996 --> 01:37:34,157
You're here all by yourself?

1354
01:37:34,231 --> 01:37:36,597
That's right. Just me.

1355
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:45,067
- Where Ripley's safe at,
keeps his valuables in?
- I don't have any idea.

1356
01:37:45,142 --> 01:37:48,669
I fuckin' bet you don't.

1357
01:37:48,746 --> 01:37:52,045
We gonna take a look upstairs
in the man's bedroom, all right?

1358
01:37:52,116 --> 01:37:55,176
You and Mr. Buddy look
at all the rooms down here.

1359
01:37:55,252 --> 01:37:57,186
Check the paintings,
behind the walls.

1360
01:37:57,254 --> 01:38:00,655
Check the fuckin' walls
in the closets. The man's
got a safe. It's here somewhere.

1361
01:38:00,724 --> 01:38:02,749
What about his place
down in Florida?

1362
01:38:02,826 --> 01:38:06,091
If you called, we could have checked
the walls down there before we left.

1363
01:38:06,163 --> 01:38:09,599
That is, if you'd bothered to find out
where he was. You follow me?

1364
01:38:11,135 --> 01:38:13,569
Man, take this bitch upstairs.

1365
01:38:13,637 --> 01:38:16,606
Upstairs!

1366
01:38:18,709 --> 01:38:21,303
Listen, you try and trip any alarms,
anything like that,

1367
01:38:21,378 --> 01:38:24,347
you gonna be a dead Hazel,
you understand me?

1368
01:38:26,317 --> 01:38:28,911
- Hey, hey, where we at? Where is it?
- Over there.

1369
01:38:28,986 --> 01:38:33,218
- Ever wear one of these?
- I don't ski.

1370
01:38:33,290 --> 01:38:36,657
Keep an eye on the maid.
I'll have a look around.

1371
01:38:41,298 --> 01:38:44,028
Go sit down. Please.

1372
01:38:49,106 --> 01:38:53,839
Damn, Mo. How's this motherfucker
livin', man? Shit!

1373
01:38:53,911 --> 01:38:56,971
Check behind the pictures
on the walls, man.

1374
01:39:00,417 --> 01:39:02,476
Hey, Mo. Found some rubbers.

1375
01:39:02,553 --> 01:39:05,351
White Boy, why the fuck
you lookin' under the mattress?

1376
01:39:05,422 --> 01:39:08,152
You know dude ain't gonna hide
no diamonds under there.

1377
01:39:08,225 --> 01:39:10,693
Damn! Dumb 'bama motherfucker.

1378
01:39:10,761 --> 01:39:15,562
- Where Foley at, man?
- He's checkin' the other rooms
like you said, boss.

1379
01:39:15,633 --> 01:39:19,899
[Chuckles]
Man, keep a eye on Foley.

1380
01:39:26,310 --> 01:39:28,835
[Static]

1381
01:39:28,912 --> 01:39:32,348
[Snoopy] Ken, stop fuckin'
with the radio, put on a CD.

1382
01:39:32,416 --> 01:39:36,011
- I don't recognize
none of these bands, Mo.
- Just pick somebody.

1383
01:39:36,086 --> 01:39:38,316
What, "How To Sing
Like Michael Bolton"?

1384
01:39:41,558 --> 01:39:44,152
What the fuck you wanna
listen to, huh?

1385
01:39:44,228 --> 01:39:48,722
- I like Schubert.
- Schubert? Well, I don't.

1386
01:39:52,870 --> 01:39:55,168
Uh, Foley?

1387
01:40:04,615 --> 01:40:06,549
Cool.

1388
01:41:07,010 --> 01:41:08,944
911 got you on hold, Richard?

1389
01:41:10,581 --> 01:41:12,515
- Foley!
- How you doin'?

1390
01:41:12,583 --> 01:41:14,778
What in God's name
is happening here?

1391
01:41:14,852 --> 01:41:17,685
- Who's upstairs?
- Snoopy Miller, couple of his friends.

1392
01:41:17,755 --> 01:41:20,815
- Maurice, from Lompoc?
- Yup.

1393
01:41:20,891 --> 01:41:22,825
Have they got Midge up there?

1394
01:41:22,893 --> 01:41:25,521
What kind of a man lets a woman
answer the door this time of night?

1395
01:41:25,596 --> 01:41:29,225
We thought it was her husband.
He comes here and checks up on her.

1396
01:41:29,299 --> 01:41:31,267
I'm supposed to be
down in Florida.

1397
01:41:31,335 --> 01:41:33,769
In a few minutes, you're gonna
wish you were. Let's go, come on.

1398
01:41:33,837 --> 01:41:35,896
Why don't you sit down?
We'll have a look at your fish.

1399
01:41:40,077 --> 01:41:44,104
Oh, that's workin'.
That's workin'.

1400
01:41:47,818 --> 01:41:49,809
[Gasps]

1401
01:41:49,887 --> 01:41:52,685
Motherfucker!
I found the safe, yo!

1402
01:41:55,225 --> 01:41:57,159
Don't go nowhere.

1403
01:41:59,863 --> 01:42:04,357
- Oh, shit! We gonna have a party!
- Look at that bitch.

1404
01:42:15,979 --> 01:42:17,674
They found the safe.

1405
01:42:17,748 --> 01:42:20,444
- Fuck.
- Buddy, you remember
Richard, don't you?

1406
01:42:20,517 --> 01:42:24,078
- Yeah, hi. Nice house.
- Thank you.

1407
01:42:26,557 --> 01:42:28,855
Yeah, man.
We just all hit this handle,

1408
01:42:28,926 --> 01:42:30,860
blow this sucker
wide open, man.

1409
01:42:30,928 --> 01:42:33,692
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's get ready.

1410
01:42:33,764 --> 01:42:36,426
Oh, Dude... you're gonna
kill me with that.

1411
01:42:40,237 --> 01:42:42,933
- Where you been, man?
- Found some steaks.

1412
01:42:43,006 --> 01:42:45,873
- Steaks?
- Yeah, some big ones, bro.

1413
01:42:45,943 --> 01:42:47,968
Man, come on.
Blast this damn safe open, man.

1414
01:42:48,045 --> 01:42:52,004
- He's down there lookin' for food.
- Fool.

1415
01:42:52,082 --> 01:42:57,543
All right. Hold it. No.
Get to the side, man. All right.

1416
01:42:57,621 --> 01:43:01,216
On three.
One, two, three.

1417
01:43:03,627 --> 01:43:06,653
- Jesus Christ, they're shooting Midge!
- Sit down, Dick.

1418
01:43:06,730 --> 01:43:08,789
They're trying to open up
the safe, not your maid.

1419
01:43:08,866 --> 01:43:13,667
[Laughing]
Oh, shit.

1420
01:43:13,737 --> 01:43:15,671
Man, we didn't even crack
this sum' bitch.

1421
01:43:26,283 --> 01:43:28,751
- Okay, hit the hinges.
- Uh-huh.

1422
01:43:28,819 --> 01:43:31,617
Put your finger in your ear, man.
This is gonna be loud.

1423
01:43:31,688 --> 01:43:34,657
All right, on three. One, two...

1424
01:43:34,725 --> 01:43:39,719
The combination is 3-10-44.

1425
01:43:41,999 --> 01:43:45,696
- Richard's birthday.
- Thank you.

1426
01:44:04,855 --> 01:44:06,982
Are they dead?

1427
01:44:08,959 --> 01:44:10,893
We gotta find Foley, man.

1428
01:44:11,161 --> 01:44:13,959
Can't believe you're still angry with me
after all this time.

1429
01:44:14,031 --> 01:44:16,932
I'm not angry with you, Richard.
In fact, I'm completely relaxed.

1430
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:21,096
The thing is, I can't figure if
it's the fish that are cooling me out,

1431
01:44:21,171 --> 01:44:25,267
or all those uncut diamonds
in the bottom of the tank, there.

1432
01:44:31,949 --> 01:44:33,883
Goddamn.

1433
01:44:33,951 --> 01:44:36,613
Dumb-fuck Glenn was right.
You got about 5 million worth in there?

1434
01:44:36,687 --> 01:44:38,621
Five point two.

1435
01:44:40,324 --> 01:44:42,622
They just look
like plain ol' rocks!

1436
01:44:42,693 --> 01:44:45,161
They sure do.
You wanna grab 'em, Buddy?

1437
01:44:51,735 --> 01:44:55,227
If I were you,
I'd get up and run.

1438
01:44:55,305 --> 01:44:58,468
- I'm not leaving Midge.
- Don't be an asshole.
They're gonna kill you.

1439
01:44:58,542 --> 01:45:02,569
Well, if that's my fate then so be it,
but I'm not leaving her.
I'm in love with her.

1440
01:45:05,582 --> 01:45:09,143
- Come on, Jack.
- Good luck, Richard.

1441
01:45:25,435 --> 01:45:28,962
- Come on, Jack.
- Shit. They're gonna rape
that maid, aren't they?

1442
01:45:29,039 --> 01:45:31,701
By the look of those guys,
they'll rip her too.

1443
01:45:31,775 --> 01:45:33,709
- Then they're gonna kill 'em.
- At least.

1444
01:45:36,213 --> 01:45:38,147
Rip, Rip.

1445
01:45:38,215 --> 01:45:40,843
- Tricky motherfucker.
- Are those my suits?

1446
01:45:40,917 --> 01:45:44,853
Naw. These are my suits.
Look at you, man.

1447
01:45:45,789 --> 01:45:47,723
Where you been hidin', Dick?

1448
01:45:49,059 --> 01:45:50,993
We made it, didn't we?

1449
01:45:51,061 --> 01:45:54,258
- All you gotta do is
get in the van, baby.
- I'm goin' back in.

1450
01:45:54,331 --> 01:45:57,732
- I'm goin' with you.
- No, you dump the van,
meet me at the airport.

1451
01:45:57,801 --> 01:45:59,962
- I'll get one of Ripley's cars.
- Jack...

1452
01:46:00,037 --> 01:46:04,337
The shit that's about to go
down here, you'll be on the phone
with your sister for a month.

1453
01:46:04,408 --> 01:46:08,845
- All I'm sayin' is we're square.
- Here.

1454
01:46:08,912 --> 01:46:11,312
Yep.

1455
01:46:11,381 --> 01:46:13,315
Jack.

1456
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:22,558
Get outta here.

1457
01:46:41,344 --> 01:46:44,745
- Get that shit off.
- [Midge] Get your hands off me!

1458
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:47,716
- Fuck you, shut up!
Nobody's gonna help you.
- [Midge Screaming]

1459
01:46:49,252 --> 01:46:52,847
- Midge!
- Fuck Midge, man.
Where the jewels at, Dick?

1460
01:46:52,923 --> 01:46:56,689
- Foley... Foley's got them.
Go after Foley!
- Where the fuck is Foley, man?

1461
01:47:03,834 --> 01:47:05,768
Midge?

1462
01:47:11,808 --> 01:47:14,140
Midge! -
- Sit your punk ass down, man.

1463
01:47:15,378 --> 01:47:17,903
- Ooh, goddamn!
- Son of a bitch!

1464
01:47:17,981 --> 01:47:21,382
Man, take the front stairs.
I'm gonna take the back.

1465
01:47:24,121 --> 01:47:26,954
- You all right?
- Where's Richard?

1466
01:47:27,023 --> 01:47:30,720
He's downstairs.
You wait here.

1467
01:47:35,732 --> 01:47:39,429
Hold it, asshole.
Drop the gun.

1468
01:47:40,704 --> 01:47:42,638
Drop it!

1469
01:47:42,706 --> 01:47:44,765
Put the damn gun down, now.

1470
01:47:45,942 --> 01:47:48,706
Now!

1471
01:47:48,778 --> 01:47:51,906
Put it down!

1472
01:47:55,085 --> 01:47:58,179
Stay right there.
Don't move. Maurice!

1473
01:47:58,255 --> 01:48:00,189
I got Foley!

1474
01:48:02,692 --> 01:48:04,626
Maurice!

1475
01:48:35,091 --> 01:48:37,855
[Laughing] Ain't got
another clip I can use, do you?

1476
01:48:37,928 --> 01:48:40,226
No, I don't.

1477
01:48:42,766 --> 01:48:46,293
- You ain't never shot
a gun before, have you?
- Not until recently, no.

1478
01:48:46,369 --> 01:48:48,803
- You a little nervous?
- Little bit, yeah.

1479
01:48:48,872 --> 01:48:53,468
You know, a situation like this
has a high potentiality...

1480
01:48:53,543 --> 01:48:55,477
for the common motherfucker
to bitch out.

1481
01:48:55,545 --> 01:48:58,309
- So I figure, why take a chance?
- [Gun Clicks]

1482
01:49:00,217 --> 01:49:02,151
Bitch!

1483
01:49:04,721 --> 01:49:06,655
- Aw, sh...!
- Motherfucker!

1484
01:49:41,958 --> 01:49:44,017
Stop! Put your hands in the air!

1485
01:50:00,677 --> 01:50:02,611
Jack?

1486
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:07,277
- I know you're up there.
- Shit!

1487
01:50:10,420 --> 01:50:13,321
- Where's Kenneth?
- He's up here.

1488
01:50:15,625 --> 01:50:17,957
He's dead.

1489
01:50:39,215 --> 01:50:42,946
- Come on, Jack, don't.
- Pretend it's not me.

1490
01:50:43,019 --> 01:50:46,147
- You think I'd shoot you?
- If you don't, somebody else will.

1491
01:50:46,222 --> 01:50:49,885
What're you now?
A desperado?

1492
01:50:49,959 --> 01:50:54,020
- Put the gun down.
- I'm not goin' back.

1493
01:50:56,066 --> 01:51:00,298
Jack, please, don't make me do this.
Put the gun down.

1494
01:51:03,073 --> 01:51:08,101
- Damn it, Jack, put the gun down!
- [Sirens In Distance]

1495
01:51:08,178 --> 01:51:10,112
No more time-outs.

1496
01:51:19,389 --> 01:51:22,119
You win, Jack.

1497
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:34,058
- I can't shoot you.
- You did. You shot me.

1498
01:51:34,137 --> 01:51:36,367
You know what I mean.

1499
01:51:49,886 --> 01:51:54,448
I'm sorry.
I wish things were different.

1500
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:39,534
Airport.

1501
01:53:06,663 --> 01:53:10,463
[Karen] Yeah, they don't know
yet if they want to bring him up
on the homicides.

1502
01:53:10,533 --> 01:53:13,366
I doubt if they will.
They'll just put a detainer on him.

1503
01:53:13,436 --> 01:53:16,405
When they're through with him here,
he'll go back to Florida.

1504
01:53:16,473 --> 01:53:18,805
[Mr. Sisko]
Are you gonna go get him?

1505
01:53:18,875 --> 01:53:21,105
It's possible. Why?

1506
01:53:21,177 --> 01:53:23,111
Well, you know,
I was just thinkin'.

1507
01:53:23,179 --> 01:53:25,113
You can have a nice time
with him on the ride down,

1508
01:53:25,181 --> 01:53:28,173
picking up where your interlude
or whatever you call it left off,

1509
01:53:28,251 --> 01:53:31,084
and then you can throw him
in the shithouse.

1510
01:53:32,589 --> 01:53:34,819
[Karen]
He knew what he was doing.

1511
01:53:34,891 --> 01:53:37,792
Nobody forced him to rob banks.

1512
01:53:39,062 --> 01:53:42,896
[Mr. Sisko]
My little girl... the tough babe.

1513
01:53:42,966 --> 01:53:44,900
[Karen]
I'll call you later.

1514
01:53:44,968 --> 01:53:47,129
[Mr. Sisco]
Good-bye.

1515
01:54:04,521 --> 01:54:06,785
Jack.

1516
01:54:09,359 --> 01:54:11,293
I got you a present.

1517
01:54:14,063 --> 01:54:16,088
Something for the road.

1518
01:54:28,077 --> 01:54:32,707
I'm gonna have to take it away,
though, soon as the ride is over.

1519
01:54:45,395 --> 01:54:48,296
Jack Foley?
Meet Hijirah Henry.

1520
01:54:59,008 --> 01:55:00,942
What kind of a name is Hijirah?

1521
01:55:01,010 --> 01:55:04,468
- It's Islamic.
- What's it stand for?

1522
01:55:04,547 --> 01:55:07,983
The "Hijirah" was Mohammed's
flight from Mecca in 622.

1523
01:55:08,051 --> 01:55:12,511
- His flight?
- Brothers in Leavenworth
gave me that name.

1524
01:55:12,589 --> 01:55:14,523
You were in Leavenworth, huh?

1525
01:55:14,591 --> 01:55:17,560
- Four time.
- Meaning?

1526
01:55:17,627 --> 01:55:20,653
- Meaning, time came, I left.
- You busted out.

1527
01:55:20,730 --> 01:55:24,257
I prefer to think of it as an exodus
from an undesirable place.

1528
01:55:27,570 --> 01:55:29,902
- How long before they
caught up with you?
- That time?

1529
01:55:32,175 --> 01:55:35,508
- There were others?
- Yeah. That was the ninth.

1530
01:55:37,513 --> 01:55:39,981
The ninth?

1531
01:55:40,049 --> 01:55:43,849
Well, ten if you count that prison
hospital in Ohio I walked away from.

1532
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:46,718
- You done a lot of walkin', Henry.
- Hijirah.

1533
01:55:46,789 --> 01:55:50,156
Hijirah.
Now we're off to Glades.

1534
01:55:50,226 --> 01:55:54,356
Yeah, it looks that way.

1535
01:55:54,430 --> 01:55:57,160
I was supposed to leave
last night with the lady marshal,

1536
01:55:57,233 --> 01:56:00,600
but for some reason
she wanted to wait.

1537
01:56:00,670 --> 01:56:04,572
- She did, huh?
- Guess it's cheaper taking
two of us down in one van.

1538
01:56:04,641 --> 01:56:09,874
Could be. Maybe she thought
we had a lot to talk about.

1539
01:56:09,946 --> 01:56:12,005
Really? Like what?

1540
01:56:13,683 --> 01:56:18,347
I don't know.
Long ride to Florida.

1541
