I'm going to look at my partner and he's going to shoot your Mr. Gwendon between the eyes.

12
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,126

But you only did a couple of miles, instead of your usual five.

好省點力氣做大事 什麼事？早做完了
Saving yourself for the big event. What happened? Finish ahead of schedule?

58
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:21,646
你看到那裡的柱子嗎？
Mira, you see those posts out there?

他們要在原來的鐵絲網後15尺的地方再築一道
They're putting up another fence 15 feet back the fence that's already there, you know?

60
00:07:26,568 --> 00:07:29,987
如果在星期日超級杯前鐵絲網已經築好了
So you figure, mira, we wait till Super Bowl Sunday, they have that fence built...

61
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:33,156

什麼？到邁阿密要100里？
It's a long run to civilization. What's it? A hundred miles to Miami?

我太老了，做不了這種特技
I'm too old to be tryin' a stunt like that.

67
00:07:50,882 --> 00:07:53,467
你出去就寄明信片來

He fired me. Hired a younger girl-- a redhead.

82

巴蒂想要帶兩輛車比較穩
Buddy thought it might be better to bring two, you know?

87
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:14,707
他說找了個你在蘭坡認識的傢伙

Which one is that? The A.T.F. guy?

Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese.

So, he files suit. Says he doesn't have any choice in what they serve,

118
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,076

124
00:11:45,427 --> 00:11:48,054
他們就是這種人
That's how those hot shots are-- all of 'em!

125
00:11:48,096 --> 00:11:50,056
我真要走了
l really gotta go.

126
00:11:53,935 --> 00:11:56,604
我們不像以前那樣聊得多了
We don't talk much anymore.

127
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:03,151
我星期天過來，一起看超級杯？
How 'bout l come over Sunday and we watch the Super Bowl together?

128
00:12:03,235 --> 00:12:05,195
太好了
l'd like that.

129
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,113
爸，謝謝那支槍
Thanks for the gun, Dad.

130
00:12:22,794 --> 00:12:25,379
他們在你下面挖了一條地道
They're right underneath you, Pup. They dug a tunnel.

131
00:12:25,463 --> 00:12:31,093
我沒聽說，地道從那裡出來？
I don't hear anything. Where's the tunnel come out?

132
00:12:31,135 --> 00:12:33,970
從守望塔第四根柱子
Fourth post from the guard tower.

133
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:36,264
我什麼也沒看見
I don't see nothin'.

134
00:12:36,306 --> 00:12:38,266
繼續看
You just keep watchin'.

135
00:13:00,495 --> 00:13:03,122
聯邦調查局，請問找哪位？
Federal Bureau of lnvestigation, how may l direct your call?

136
00:13:03,164 --> 00:13:05,707
我是凱倫西斯柯，找雷尼可
Yeah, this is Karen Sisco again for Ray Nicolet.

137
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,876
請稍等
Hold, please.

138
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,878
好
Yeah.

139
00:13:30,438 --> 00:13:32,981
占線，你要留言嗎？
The line is busy. Would you like his voice mail?

140
00:13:33,024 --> 00:13:36,318
不用了，我等一下再打
No, forget it. l'll call back later.

141
00:13:36,361 --> 00:13:38,321
- 好的 - 謝謝
- All right. - Thanks.

142
00:13:39,613 --> 00:13:41,531
還是沒看到
StilI don't see anything.

143
00:13:43,742 --> 00:13:46,327
你馬上就看到了
You will directly.

144
00:13:48,705 --> 00:13:51,248
等一下
Wait a minute.

145
00:13:53,856 --> 00:13:54,721
尼古丁口香糖

146
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,727
見鬼！
What the fuck?

147
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:30,367
鐵絲網旁邊有兩個人！
Two men by the fence!

148
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:50,302
她在搞什麼鬼？
What the hell is she doin'?

149
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:01,937
別動！舉起手來！
Stop! Get your hands in the air!

150
00:15:19,037 --> 00:15:23,124
地道裡沒人
Tunnel's clear. Seal up the north face.

151
00:15:23,165 --> 00:15:26,668
- 發生什麼事？ - 你說呢？有人越獄了
- What happened? - What the hell do you think, jackass? Got a jail break!

152
00:15:26,752 --> 00:15:30,421
古巴人在哪裡？別對著我 嘿！巴蒂！
Cubans out in the cane. Don't point that thing at me. Hey, Buddy.

153
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:34,634
- 別緊張，我們是好人 - 你在這裡幹什麼？
- It's okay, we're the good guys. - What are you doing here?

154
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:38,637
她只是個女孩，為什麼用槍？
All right. You're just a girl. What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?

155
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:43,516
- 我是聯邦警察，你被捕了！ - 可能都是
- I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest. - That's probably all the hacks.

156
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,977
我們等會再說吧
Why don't we talk about this later?

157
00:15:47,604 --> 00:15:49,522
小心你的頭
Watch your head.

158
00:15:49,606 --> 00:15:51,274
我進來了，走吧
I'm in. Let's go!

159
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:56,987
- 你舒服嗎？ - 太擠了
- Hey! You comfy? - lf l could have a little more room--

160
00:15:57,071 --> 00:15:58,989
沒地方了
Well, there isn't any.

161
00:15:59,073 --> 00:16:02,117
這裡有好東西，手銬啊
We got a lot of shit in here. We got handcuffs in here.

162
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,786
這罐子裡是什麼？
What's in this can?

163
00:16:04,828 --> 00:16:07,789
除口臭的，擠一點到你嘴巴裡
That's for your breath. You could use it-- squirt some in your mouth.

164
00:16:07,831 --> 00:16:09,832
那是美斯，不是嗎？
Yeah, well, that's mace, isn't it?

165
00:16:16,547 --> 00:16:19,591
好吧！你，去……
All right, you! Get--

166
00:16:21,677 --> 00:16:25,513
嘿，你的槍呢？你的手槍
Hey. Where's your gun-- pistol?

167
00:16:25,555 --> 00:16:28,641
在車裡，我的包裡
ln my bag, in the car.

168
00:16:39,026 --> 00:16:40,986
要命，這裡真臭
Boy, it stunk in there.

169
00:16:41,027 --> 00:16:44,822
我想是的，你把我爸給我的值900元的套裝弄壞了
l believe it. You're ruining a $900 suit my dad gave me.

170
00:16:44,864 --> 00:16:47,449
它和那只12口徑的槍很配
Yeah, it went great with that 12-gauge too.

171
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:49,785
像你這種人怎麼會當法警
Why in the world would someone like you become a federal marshal?

172
00:16:49,869 --> 00:16:52,871
- 專門抓你這種人 - 那是什麼意思？
- The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me. - Sorry, what was that?

173
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:55,081
像我這種人！讓我告訴你吧
Guys like me? Let me tell you something.

174
00:16:55,165 --> 00:16:58,376
雖然我近來單身，但是我不是非要纏著你不可
Even though l've been celibate lately, I'm not going to force myself on you.

175
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,087
- 我從沒做過 - 你不會有時間做
- l've never done that in my life. - You wouldn't have time, anyway.

176
00:17:01,171 --> 00:17:04,549
碰到路障，他們查車後就會知道這是誰的車了
We come to a roadblock, they run the car and find out who it belongs to.

177
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:07,926
即使他們要設的話，我懷疑他們能否及時設一個
That's if they get set up in time, which l doubt. lf they do,

178
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:12,013
他們要找兩個拉丁人，而不是個黑大個.
they'll be lookin' for a bunch of little Latin fellas, not a big black guy drivin' a Ford.

179
00:17:12,055 --> 00:17:15,224
他真是你的好兄弟，如此拿自己來犧牲
He must be quite a pal, to risk his own ass like this.

180
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,310
巴蒂，他是個好傢伙
Buddy? Yeah, he's a good guy.

181
00:17:17,394 --> 00:17:22,607
我們一起坐牢時，他每週一定打電話給他姐姐
Back when we jailed together, he used to call his sister every week, without fail.

182
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:26,401
她是重生的基督徒，給電視布道家記賬
She's a born-again Christian. She does bookkeeping for a televangelist.

183
00:17:26,485 --> 00:17:28,403
他會打電話向她懺悔
He'd call her up, confess his sins.

184
00:17:28,487 --> 00:17:30,739
告訴他搶過的銀行
He'd tell her whatever bank he happened to rob at the time.

185
00:17:30,822 --> 00:17:32,907
巴蒂是他的名字嗎？
Buddy-- that his given name?

186
00:17:32,991 --> 00:17:35,409
對！我給他取得
The one l gave him, yeah.

187
00:17:35,493 --> 00:17:38,745
你叫什麼？
So, what's your name?

188
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,248
明天看報就知道了
Be in the paper tomorrow, anyway.

189
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,542
傑克弗裡，你恐怕聽過
Jack Foley. You've probably heard of me.

190
00:17:44,585 --> 00:17:47,837
-為什麼，你很有名嗎？ -我在加州被判刑時
-Why? Are you famous? -The time l was convicted in California,

191
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:52,842
調查局說我搶銀行的紀錄比誰都多
the F.B.l. told me that l'd robbed more banks than anybody in the computer.

192
00:17:52,926 --> 00:17:55,595
- 多少次？ - 我真的不知道
- How many was that? - Tell you the truth, I don't really know.

193
00:17:55,636 --> 00:18:01,057
我18歲時開始替我叔叔卡利和他搭檔開車
Started when l was 18 years old, driving for my Uncle Cully, and his partner, Gus.

194
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,729
你是說你半輩子都在牢裡
So, basically you're saying you spent half your life in prison.

195
00:18:05,771 --> 00:18:08,440
對，如果再被逮住，要關30年
Basically, yeah. l go back, l do 30 years. No time off.

196
00:18:08,523 --> 00:18:13,569
- 你能想像嗎？ - 我不用想，我又不搶銀行
- You imagine lookin' at that? - I don't have to. I don't rob banks.

197
00:18:16,197 --> 00:18:18,115
你好像一點都不怕
You don't seem all that scared.

198
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:21,952
- 我當然怕 - 看不出來
- Of course l am. - You don't act like it.

199
00:18:21,994 --> 00:18:23,954
你要我大叫嗎？
What do you want me to do, scream?

200
00:18:23,995 --> 00:18:26,121
那也起不了作用
That wouldn't help much, anyway.

201
00:18:26,164 --> 00:18:31,835
我打算坐在這裡，等你自己搞砸
No, I'm just gonna sit here, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.

202
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,296
聽起來像我前妻
You sound like my ex-wife.

203
00:18:34,338 --> 00:18:38,800
- 你結過婚 - 一年左右
- You were married? - Just for about a year, give or take a few days.

204
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:41,761
我們相處得不錯，只是……
It's not like we didn't get along-- we had fun. We just...

205
00:18:41,803 --> 00:18:45,431
沒有那種……
didn't have... that thing, you know, that uh--

206
00:18:45,473 --> 00:18:50,269
- 激情，那很重要 - 嗯哼
- That spark, you know? Gotta have that. - Mm-hmm.

207
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:52,646
- 儘管我們仍在說話 - 是嗎？
- We still talk, though. - Sure.

208
00:18:55,524 --> 00:18:58,151
你是不會有好下場的 做這種事永遠都不會有
This is not gonna end well. These things never do.

209
00:18:58,193 --> 00:19:00,987
我要死也想被人打死在大街上
lf it turns out l get shot like a dog, it's gonna be in the street,

210
00:19:01,071 --> 00:19:03,156
不想死在牢裡
not off a goddamn fence.

211
00:19:03,198 --> 00:19:06,867
你真以為你是什麼克萊貝羅
You must really see yourself as some kind of Clyde Barrow, huh?

212
00:19:11,455 --> 00:19:14,332
- 你是指邦尼和克萊 - 是的
- You mean, of Bonnie and Clyde? - Yeah.

213
00:19:18,044 --> 00:19:21,797
電影中他們中彈 華倫比提和……
The part in the movie where they get shot, when it's Warren Beatty and--

214
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,382
- 費唐 娜薇 - 費唐 娜薇，yeah.
- Faye Dunaway. - Faye Dunaway, yeah.

215
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:28,720
- 我喜歡她演的「電視網」 - 演得真好
- l like her in that movie about TV. - Network, yeah, she was good.

216
00:19:28,804 --> 00:19:31,890
那傢伙說他再不吃那套
And that guy says he's not gonna take any more shit from anybody.

217
00:19:31,974 --> 00:19:34,559
- 彼特 芬奇 - Yeah! 彼特 芬奇
- Peter Finch. - Yeah! Peter Finch.

218
00:19:34,643 --> 00:19:38,688
「我已經火大了，我不會吃你那套」
''I'm mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take any more of your shit!''

219
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:43,484
在他們中槍的那一節，我記得我一直在想……
ln that part where they get shot, l can remember thinkin' to myself,

220
00:19:43,526 --> 00:19:48,739
如果你別無選擇的時候，這個結局也不算太壞
thinkin', ''Hey, that wouldn't be such a bad way to go, if you had to.''

221
00:20:08,965 --> 00:20:10,883
你很會和人聊天
You sure are easy to talk to.

222
00:20:14,971 --> 00:20:19,850
如果我們在不同的場合下遇到
l was thinkin', if we met under different circumstances--

223
00:20:19,892 --> 00:20:23,561
你在酒吧，我出現，我們交談
if you were in a bar and l came up and we started talkin'--

224
00:20:23,604 --> 00:20:26,189
- 然後呢？ - 沒有了
- l wonder what would happen. - Nothing.

225
00:20:26,231 --> 00:20:29,400
- 如果你不知道我是誰 - 你可能會告訴我
- lf you didn't know who l was. - You'd probably tell me.

226
00:20:29,442 --> 00:20:32,653
- 如果場合不同…… - 你在開玩笑
- Just saying if we met under different circumstances-- - You have got to be kidding.

227
00:20:32,737 --> 00:20:35,698
是, 是
Yeah. Yeah.

228
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:40,619
我喜歡另一部費唐娜薇演的電影是《三日兀鷹》
Another movie l liked with Faye Dunaway was Three Days of the Condor.

229
00:20:40,702 --> 00:20:43,371
勞伯瑞夫年輕時拍的那部
The one with Robert Redford when he was young.

230
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:45,373
是
Yeah.

231
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,669
那部電影一點意思都沒有
You know, l never thought it made sense, though--

232
00:20:50,753 --> 00:20:53,755
他們那麼快就好上了
you know, the way they got together so quick.

233
00:20:53,798 --> 00:20:55,758
是嘛？
Why not?

234
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:58,092
- 很浪漫 - 嗯哼
- l mean, romantically. - Mm-hmm.

235
00:21:01,096 --> 00:21:04,765
可是……
Well, but it-- if-- uh. All right.

236
00:21:05,308 --> 00:21:07,935
又停了。 我們現在在哪裡?
Here we go. All right. Where the hell are we?

237
00:21:07,977 --> 00:21:09,978
公路收費口，葛蘭在上面另一輛車裡
At the turnpike. Glenn's right above us with the other car.

238
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:13,064
- 快出來! - 背過身舉起手
- All right, c'mon. Hop on out. - Turn around and get your hands up!

239
00:21:13,107 --> 00:21:15,192
快出來!背過身舉起手
Shit!

240
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,485
別管她，反正我們也不要這輛車了
We may as well leave her. We're leavin' the car...

241
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:19,320
我們總要把她甩了
and we gotta leave her someplace, anyway-- what's the difference where?

242
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:22,281
- 她得跟著我們。 - 天啊，你在那裡搞什麼?
- She's comin' with us. - Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?

243
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:25,242
- 找名字 - 找過了
- Look for a name. - l already looked.

244
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,620
她叫凱倫西思科，像席司科孩童，拼法不同
Her name is Karen Sisco. Like the Cisco Kid, only spelled different.

245
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,788
S-l-S-C-O.
S-l-S-C-O.

246
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,378
Karen?
Karen?

247
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,673
凱倫，你要老實一點
All right, Karen? You be a good girl, now.

248
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,800
我要打開後車蓋了
I'm gonna open up the trunk.

249
00:21:42,842 --> 00:21:47,137
喂! 喂! 喂! 你在往自己車上打窟窿
Hey, hey, hey, now! Now, you're puttin' holes in your car!

250
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:53,017
我不會把你扔在這裡， 我要開後車蓋，你把槍扔出來。
I'm not leavin' you. I'm gonna open the trunk enough for you to drop your pistol out.

251
00:21:53,101 --> 00:21:56,729
巴蒂有你的獵槍， 你要開槍的話，他會射回去
Now, if you shoot, Buddy's got your shotgun, he's gonna shoot back.

252
00:21:56,813 --> 00:21:59,648
我攔不住他，就看你自己了
There's nothin' l can do about it, so it's up to you.

253
00:21:59,732 --> 00:22:04,653
別開槍!是葛蘭
Hey. Don't! It's Glenn! Whoa!

254
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:08,198
媽的，傑克，很高興見到你
Fuck! Hey, hey, Jack. Good to see you, man.

255
00:22:08,281 --> 00:22:11,659
你們在射誰?
What the fuck are you guys shooting at?

256
00:22:11,701 --> 00:22:13,911
- 我們要他嗎? - 警察見過這輛車
- Do we need 'im? - The cop saw this car.

257
00:22:13,995 --> 00:22:16,956
- 他可能會起疑心再調回頭 - 好吧
- He might tie it to the break and turn around. - All right.

258
00:22:16,998 --> 00:22:21,543
- 嘿，小伙子，我們沒認出你 - 嘿，「小伙子。」
- Hey, Studs. We didn't recognize ya. - Hey, ''Studs,'' man.

259
00:22:21,627 --> 00:22:26,714
從蘭坡出來後就沒有聽過混得怎麼樣?
l haven't heard that since Lompoc, man. So what's goin' on?

260
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:30,009
沒怎麼樣
Aw, nothin'.

261
00:22:31,052 --> 00:22:35,055
凱倫，你要出來嗎?
Karen. Are you comin' out?

262
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,060
- 聽到了嗎？ - 好吧。
- You hear that? - Okay!

263
00:22:42,354 --> 00:22:44,314
—聽到了嗎？好吧。
Okay.

264
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,490
算你贏，傑克
You win, Jack.

265
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,918
衣服乾洗完後 帳單寄給我
Now, you get your clothes cleaned, you send me the bill.

266
00:23:08,002 --> 00:23:09,962
我會寄到葛雷茲去
l'll send it to you at Glades.

267
00:23:10,046 --> 00:23:13,382
你是不是剛從陰溝洞裡爬出來?你是誰?
What, did you crawl through a sewer, man? Who're you?

268
00:23:13,424 --> 00:23:16,843
- 摘下墨鏡 - 戴著看得更清楚
- Take your sunglasses off. - l see better with 'em on, man.

269
00:23:16,885 --> 00:23:19,178
小心我把你和墨鏡一起扔到天橋上去
You don't take 'em off I'm gonna throw them off while they're still on your head.

270
00:23:19,221 --> 00:23:24,392
- 等在車裡 - 文明社會裡，說話客氣點
- Go wait in the car. - Um, we're in civilization now, so you can ease up a little bit.

271
00:23:24,434 --> 00:23:28,687
對不起，請你在車裡等，帶上她，放在後座!
I'm sorry. l'd like you to wait in the car, please. Take her, put her in the back.

272
00:23:28,729 --> 00:23:32,690
- 後車廂？後坐！
- Okay. ln the trunk? - ln the backseat! ln the backseat!

273
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:36,111
- 過來!因為我要…… - 把外套給我!
- Backseat. Okay, you gotta come now, 'cause l gotta do this-- - Gimme your jacket.

274
00:23:36,194 --> 00:23:38,571
我需要乾淨衣服
Somebody forgot to bring the clean clothes.

275
00:23:38,613 --> 00:23:40,698
乾淨衣服在凱迪拉克車裡
l brought 'em. They're at Glades in the back of the Cadillac.

276
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,075
是你自己要跳進她的後車箱
You decided to jump into the trunk of her car.

277
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:45,702
你可以怪我，我不介意
You can blame me if you want. I don't mind.

278
00:23:45,745 --> 00:23:49,414
—給你：我要告訴你……
- Here, sir. - l'll tell you--

279
00:23:49,456 --> 00:23:52,041
- 你有什麼毛病? - 你為什麼叫葛蘭來
- What's your problem, Jack? - I don't know why you got Glenn involved in this.

280
00:23:52,084 --> 00:23:54,419
- 這件事是他的主意 - 他?
- How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with? - ldea--

281
00:23:54,502 --> 00:23:56,587
他沒有大腦的
The guy's got a fuckin' vacant lot for a head.

282
00:23:56,629 --> 00:24:00,590
他以為他可以用這種口氣跟我說話
He thinks he can talk to me like that? Shit.

283
00:24:00,633 --> 00:24:05,595
「把外套給我」我坐在這裡等了半個鐘頭
''Gimme your jacket.'' l have been sitting here for over a half-hour,

284
00:24:05,638 --> 00:24:09,433
防備著警察。你以為那是好玩的?
watchin' out for the Highway Patrol, if you think that's fun.

285
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:12,977
我得鑽進灌木叢……
God. You know, l hadda go over there in the bushes...

286
00:24:13,061 --> 00:24:17,398
抽根大麻，這樣我才能…你知道嗎?
to smoke a joint, just so l could like-- you know?

287
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,277
對。我在北部有大計劃
Yep. l got somethin' big lined up, up north.

288
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,656
如果沒有我，這些傢伙怎麼可能知道
Yeah, these guys? Wouldn't even fuckin' know about it if it wasn't for me.

289
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,201
- 他一講話我就想揍他 - 他不是問題。
- Every time he opens his mouth, l wanna punch him out. - He's not the problem, Jack.

290
00:24:30,285 --> 00:24:33,246
你幹什麼要把她帶著?
You wanna pull your head outta your ass, tell me why the hell we're bringing her with us?

291
00:24:33,288 --> 00:24:35,540
葛蘭
Glenn.

292
00:24:35,623 --> 00:24:37,916
你不記得我了嗎?
You don't remember me, do you?

293
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,631
我從未進過葛雷茲，如果你是這個意思的話
Um, couldn't have been Glades if that's what you're thinkin', 'cause l was never out there.

294
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:48,510
- 我不是這個意思 - 是
- No, that's not what I'm thinking. - Oh, yeah?

295
00:24:48,593 --> 00:24:52,096
但你肯定我們見過?
But you're sure we've met, huh?

296
00:24:52,138 --> 00:24:53,847
去年秋天
Last fall.

297
00:24:53,931 --> 00:24:58,977
我押著你從棕櫚灘縣監獄到聯邦法院，兩次。
l drove you from the Palm Beach County Jail to the federal courthouse... twice.

298
00:24:59,061 --> 00:25:01,396
你是葛蘭麥克
You're Glenn Michaels.

299
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,190
我從不忘記我逮過的任何人
l never forget anybody l've cuffed and shackled.

300
00:25:04,274 --> 00:25:06,984
讓我們來想想辦法，葛蘭
Now let's think about this for a minute, Glenn, see if we can't work it out.

301
00:25:07,026 --> 00:25:10,695
車裡有槍嗎？
Do we have a gun in the car?

302
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:13,615
見鬼，我記起來了
Oh, shit! l remember you! Hey!

303
00:25:13,657 --> 00:25:16,993
弗理不會有好下場的，他完蛋，你也跟著完蛋
Foley's not gonna make it, and if he goes down, you go with him.

304
00:25:17,035 --> 00:25:19,870
- 你們關係近的話我倒能瞭解。 - 不，我跟他根本不熟
- Now, look. l can understand if you guys are close, but-- - No, we're not.

305
00:25:19,955 --> 00:25:25,168
- 但我現在是在幫他 - 等一下，葛蘭。
- But, yeah. I'm helpin' him. - Now wait a minute, Glenn.

306
00:25:25,251 --> 00:25:27,169
你以前幫過他嗎?
Have you helped him?

307
00:25:27,253 --> 00:25:31,423
目前我想你還應該不會被控「越獄共犯」的罪名
l mean, technically, at this point, l doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive.

308
00:25:31,507 --> 00:25:33,467
你還有機會
So you still have a choice.

309
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:37,512
你想把她帶到我那裡洗乾淨，抹上科龍水……
You wanna take her to my place, get cleaned up, come out of the bathroom...

310
00:25:37,596 --> 00:25:40,682
出來，然後她說「原來我看錯你了。」
with your aftershave on, and she goes, ''Oh. l had you all wrong.''

311
00:25:40,765 --> 00:25:42,683
我只是想同她再聊幾句
No. l just wanna talk to her again, that's all.

312
00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:46,562
看看在正常情況下會怎樣
l just wanna see what it might have been like under normal circumstances.

313
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,063
太遲了
It's too late for that, Jack.

314
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,358
他想擺脫我們，我不怪他
He wants to get out of here, and I don't blame him.

315
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,833
兩年前

316
00:26:12,312 --> 00:26:16,112
在蘭坡聯邦監獄

317
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:34,271
如果裁判再不叫停的話，那小子要被裝在裹屍袋抬出去了。
Ref don't call it soon, Snoop's gonna send this cat out in a body bag.

318
00:26:35,732 --> 00:26:38,442
你知道他們為什麼叫他「史努比?」
Anybody ever tell you why they call him ''Snoopy''?

319
00:26:40,653 --> 00:26:43,238
他以前叫「瘋狗」莫瑞
He used to be Maurice ''Mad Dog'' Miller...

320
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,740
當他還是職業拳手的時候
back when he was a pro.

321
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:49,410
現在你輕拍他，他就倒下來
Now you pet him, he goes down.

322
00:26:55,624 --> 00:26:58,585
- 難以置信 - 天啊!
- I don't believe it! - Oh, my!

323
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,925
胡鬧!胡鬧
Bullshit! Bullshit!

324
00:27:09,262 --> 00:27:11,430
好，你行
Yeah, you the man.

325
00:27:16,518 --> 00:27:18,770
那小子到處吹他
Guy's bragging he won a thrown fight.

326
00:27:18,812 --> 00:27:20,772
贏了一場做假的拳賽
Fuckin' pathetic.

327
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,527
他要倒楣了
Dangerous is what it is.

328
00:27:30,197 --> 00:27:33,616
- 那個禿子是誰?  - 理查瑞利。
- Who's the bald dude? - Richard Ripley.

329
00:27:33,701 --> 00:27:36,119
華爾街的?
The Wall Street guy?

330
00:27:36,203 --> 00:27:38,955
他騙了好多人的錢，渾號騙子迪克
Call him Dick The Ripper on account of all the guys he ripped off.

331
00:27:38,997 --> 00:27:42,249
沒戴假髮我都認不出他
Oh, yeah. l didn't recognize him without his rug.

332
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:44,335
- 他被判多少年?  - 三年。
- What's his bid? - Three years.

333
00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:47,463
你們被罰了嗎?
You guys on the bench? Okay.

334
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:51,633
三年，罰金五千萬，他媽的就寫了張支票
Three years, fined $50 million and wrote 'em a fuckin' check.

335
00:27:51,675 --> 00:27:53,635
就這樣
Just like that.

336
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:56,388
五千萬，簽一個名而已
Fifty mill, signed his name.

337
00:27:56,471 --> 00:27:59,557
還沒有…對了…幫個小忙
Didn't even-- Didn't even-- Okay, a little help.

338
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:01,475
夠了，太重
Okay, heavy!

339
00:28:01,517 --> 00:28:03,477
天!太重了
Heavy! Come on!

340
00:28:07,147 --> 00:28:11,025
陽光刺眼，看不清上面的數字。
All the bright glare out here, you couldn't read the numbers on the weights.

341
00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:13,986
我知道了
Oh. l had it. Jesus.

342
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:17,824
- 你怎麼知道他寫了張支票？ - 他告訴我的。
- How do you know he wrote a check? - Uh, he told me.

343
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:20,492
我們一起在洗衣房當差
We work laundry together.

344
00:28:20,535 --> 00:28:22,828
那傢伙真他媽的愛說。
Guy loves to fucking talk.

345
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:26,081
他愛說：他告訴聯邦檢察官
Yeah, he loves to talk. He talked to the U.S. attorney.

346
00:28:26,165 --> 00:28:28,667
他被那些與他做生意的人告發了
Rolled over on all the snitches he was doing business with.

347
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:33,170
有哪個傢伙能拿出五千萬的支票
Hey! Any guy who can write a fuckin' check for $50 million,

348
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:36,841
他說什麼我都聽
he says anything, I'm all fuckin' ears.

349
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:40,844
他告訴我他把錢都存在外國銀行
Guy tells me he's got all this money in foreign banks.

350
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:43,304
加上，大概……
Plus, around, mmm,

351
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:47,225
他家裡值五百萬未加工的鑽石
five million in uncut diamonds at his house.

352
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,227
他說
He said, quote,

353
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:52,188
「我可以隨時動這筆錢。」
that l can get my hands on it at any time.

354
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,482
- 他住哪裡？ - 底特律。
- Where does he live? - Detroit.

355
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:59,695
史努比米勒說未加工的鑽石跟現金一樣好處理。
Snoopy Miller says that uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.

356
00:29:02,197 --> 00:29:04,532
見過未加工的鑽石嗎?
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs?

357
00:29:04,616 --> 00:29:07,410
就像一般石頭
Looks just like a plain, old rock.

358
00:29:07,494 --> 00:29:11,539
慢著，你以為他在說謊?
Wait, you think this guy's lying?

359
00:29:13,874 --> 00:29:17,252
你說呢?用你的大腦想一想如果他有五百萬，
What do you think, Studs? Use your head. Some guy's got $5 million...

360
00:29:17,336 --> 00:29:21,965
他會告訴你這樣在監獄裡的大嘴巴?
socked away in his house, and he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it.

361
00:29:23,383 --> 00:29:25,885
我就知道你們不會相信我
Oh, l see. You guys are cynical. Right.

362
00:29:36,854 --> 00:29:38,772
來了
Here it comes.

363
00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:55,244
別停下，繼續走
Keep on walking. Keep walking.

364
00:29:55,287 --> 00:29:57,705
你別回答任何問題
You don't wanna be answering any questions.

365
00:30:05,296 --> 00:30:07,589
我只是說她一點都不怕
I'm just saying she wasn't scared, that's all.

366
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:10,925
因為她手裡有手槍
That's 'cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time waitin' to make her move.

367
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,844
你是嫉妒你沒有在後車箱跟她在一起。。。
You're just jealous 'cause it was me in the trunk with her...

368
00:30:13,929 --> 00:30:15,847
- 不是你 - 對了。
- and not you. - You're right.

369
00:30:15,931 --> 00:30:19,726
讓我先把自己弄乾淨
The first thing I'm gonna do... is get this mud off me.

370
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,562
喂。
Hey.

371
00:32:24,422 --> 00:32:26,548
凱倫
Karen?

372
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,926
凱倫，親愛的?
Karen, honey?

373
00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:32,303
凱倫
Karen?

374
00:32:32,387 --> 00:32:34,722
你說夢話
You were talking in your sleep.

375
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,728
我說了甚麼
What'd l say?

376
00:32:41,812 --> 00:32:43,730
「嘿，你自己。」
''Hey, yourself.''

377
00:32:45,733 --> 00:32:48,735
喂
Huh.

378
00:32:48,819 --> 00:32:51,321
喂，丹尼爾
Hello, Daniel.

379
00:32:56,617 --> 00:33:01,079
丹尼爾波頓，聯邦調查局
Daniel Burdon, F.B.l.

380
00:33:01,121 --> 00:33:03,539
聯邦警察西思柯，凱倫的父親。
Marshall Sisco, Karen's dad.

381
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:05,542
- Hmm. - Hmm.
- Hmm. - Hmm.

382
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:07,544
Umm--
Umm--

383
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:10,755
請你在外面等等
Would you mind, please, waiting outside?

384
00:33:10,797 --> 00:33:12,923
我們有事要談
We have some business to do here.

385
00:33:15,218 --> 00:33:17,595
反正我要上廁所
Well, uh, l have to use the john anyway.

386
00:33:17,636 --> 00:33:19,596
對不起。
- Excuse me. - Yeah.

387
00:33:24,476 --> 00:33:27,603
我要加入特勤小組 丹尼爾 
l wanna be on the task force, Daniel.

388
00:33:27,687 --> 00:33:29,980
嗯--
Well--

389
00:33:30,064 --> 00:33:34,568
謝謝你的好意，但是……
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but...

390
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:38,697
我已有足夠的人力
l got all the help l can use right now.

391
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:43,243
讓我們談一下你頭上的包是怎麼來的
lnstead, let's talk about how you got that bump on your head.

392
00:33:43,285 --> 00:33:45,787
你手上拿的不是我的卷宗嗎?
lsn't that my file you're holding on to?

393
00:33:45,829 --> 00:33:49,040
是的，但是我要聽你親口講
Yes, but l want to hear it from you,

394
00:33:49,123 --> 00:33:52,626
從你和他搶駕駛盤開始
starting... with when you grabbed the wheel.

395
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,545
這是在那兒?
Where was this?

396
00:33:55,629 --> 00:33:57,547
快到歐基喬比出口的地方
Coming to the Okeechobee exit.

397
00:33:57,631 --> 00:34:00,800
- 坐好! - 你戴著墨鏡，能看得到嗎?
- Sit back! - Can you see with those glasses on?

398
00:34:00,842 --> 00:34:03,636
我很好!這…真笨
I'm fine! This is... stupid, man.

399
00:34:03,678 --> 00:34:06,138
這些傢伙會對我很失望
These guys are gonna be so disappointed in me, man.

400
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,515
你知道嗎？如果不是吸了大麻
You know what? lf l wasn't stoned,

401
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:11,560
我才不會聽你的
there is no way that you would have talked me into this.

402
00:34:11,644 --> 00:34:14,479
- 記住 - 過了橋就從這裡出去
- Remember that. - Get off at the exit right after that bridge.

403
00:34:14,521 --> 00:34:18,107
我不會去自首
No, l am not fucking turning myself in, so forget it!

404
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:20,275
- 往那邊開 - 哪邊?
- Get off at that exit! - What exit?

405
00:34:20,318 --> 00:34:22,736
- 那邊的出口 - 坐好!
-That exit right there. Take that exit! -Sit back! No!

406
00:34:30,494 --> 00:34:32,620
當我清醒時
The next thing l knew,

407
00:34:32,663 --> 00:34:36,082
救護人員把我從車裡拖出來
the paramedics were pulling me out of the car.

408
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:39,001
- 你還好 - 有幾個問題我懷疑的是……
- You all right? - There's a couple of points l keep wondering about--

409
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:41,211
有關那兩個捉你的傢伙
have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.

410
00:34:41,295 --> 00:34:45,340
是巴蒂?和這個傢伙傑克弗理
Buddy, is it? And this fella Jack Foley.

411
00:34:45,424 --> 00:34:49,093
這個人起碼已搶了200家銀行
l swear, the man must have robbed over 200 banks in his time.

412
00:34:49,177 --> 00:34:51,095
啊？
- Really? - Um-hmm.

413
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:53,431
他告訴我他記不得搶了多少家
He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.

414
00:34:53,515 --> 00:34:56,017
那你和他談過話
Then you talked to him.

415
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,477
在後車箱裡，是啊
ln the trunk, yeah.

416
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:01,062
你們談甚麼?
What'd you talk about?

417
00:35:01,147 --> 00:35:03,190
各種事
Different things.

418
00:35:03,232 --> 00:35:06,109
監獄，電影
Prison, movies.

419
00:35:06,193 --> 00:35:10,863
這傢伙綁架你，你還跟他談電影?
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?

420
00:35:13,157 --> 00:35:15,992
這是個不平凡的經驗
lt was an unusual experience.

421
00:35:16,035 --> 00:35:19,037
弗理讓我想起卡爾提門
You know, Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman.

422
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:22,707
你去看時，他剛巧在搶銀行
The one that you were seeing, it turns out, the same time he was robbing banks.

423
00:35:22,749 --> 00:35:25,209
- 你記不記得? - 卡爾怎麼了?
- Do you recall that? - And what happened to Carl?

424
00:35:25,252 --> 00:35:29,213
你對他開槍。但是你沒打弗理和他的朋友
The time came, you shot him. But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.

425
00:35:29,255 --> 00:35:33,842
他們沒帶武器。你有散彈鎗。卻讓他們把你丟進後車箱。
They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk.

426
00:35:33,885 --> 00:35:36,303
你手上有西格手槍
Okay. Now you got your Sig in your hand,

427
00:35:36,387 --> 00:35:38,764
你在報告中說你不能回頭
and you say in the report that you couldn't turn around.

428
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:42,141
但是當車箱打開時
He had you pinned down. But when the trunk opened,

429
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:44,894
為什麼你不打死他們?
how come you didn't cap the two guys then?

430
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:48,356
你平常做什麼？ 捉做手腳的簿記人員?
What do you work on most of the time? Fraud? Go after crooked bookkeepers?

431
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:52,985
我在局裡十五年，參加過各種不同的調查
Karen, l've been with the bureau 15 years on all kinds of investigations.

432
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:55,988
- 曾經射殺過人沒有？ - 沒有。
- Have you ever shot a man? - No.

433
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:59,532
- 你有沒有帶頭破門而入過? - 我還要資格審查?
- When was the last time you were primary through the door? - l have to qualify?

434
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,576
你必須知道你自己在說什麼
You have to know what you're talking about.

435
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,083
下次再談
We'll talk another time. All right, Karen?

436
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:15,588
奇怪!為什麼弗理在不須要你的時候 還把你放進第二輛車……
l'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you anymore.

437
00:36:18,592 --> 00:36:19,968
那你只有去問他自己了
You'll have to ask him that.

438
00:36:36,107 --> 00:36:38,108
Rip, Rip.
Rip, Rip.

439
00:36:38,151 --> 00:36:41,153
- 談個交易怎麼樣? - 嗨，莫瑞。
- What the deal is, baby? - Hi, Maurice.

440
00:36:41,237 --> 00:36:43,697
- 我不知道 - 來敲敲手
- Oops. I don't know. - Make a fist--

441
00:36:43,781 --> 00:36:46,283
- 又來了 - 走開
- There you go. - Fuck it, man.

442
00:36:46,325 --> 00:36:48,535
- 我拿到你要的金魚了 - 好
- Got your little fishies for you. - Oh, good.

443
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:53,790
慢點。價錢漲了
Not so fast. Starting out, there's gonna be an across the board cost of living increase.

444
00:36:53,873 --> 00:36:57,417
- 什麼？ - 我是因信用欺詐被抓進來的
- What? - When l got put in here a year ago on credit card fraud,

445
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,420
不過只是個小角色
l didn't really get no props for that.

446
00:36:59,462 --> 00:37:03,257
但自從我在院子裡捅了那個大嘴巴後
But ever since l shanked that loudmouth pussy in the yard,

447
00:37:03,299 --> 00:37:07,803
我的名聲大漲
it's like my Dun and Broadstreet around this bitch done shot way the fuck up.

448
00:37:07,886 --> 00:37:11,847
變成大英雄了
Actually, it's Dun and Bradstreet. That's the, uh--

449
00:37:11,931 --> 00:37:14,224
我都聽說了
Well, l've heard it both ways.

450
00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:16,894
最重要的是，價錢漲了
Point is that the price has gone up around this bitch too.

451
00:37:16,978 --> 00:37:19,939
把你的黑冊子拿出來我們要辦正事
Get your little black book out. We got some business to talk about.

452
00:37:22,483 --> 00:37:25,235
這些魚，我以前講的價錢是
For the little fishies-- What'd l say they was gonna be?

453
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:28,446
- 兩千 - 現在是三千
- Two thousand. - Now they're gonna be three thousand.

454
00:37:28,488 --> 00:37:31,490
- 什麼… - 現在是三千
- Come on. You-- - Now they're gonna be three thousand.

455
00:37:33,576 --> 00:37:35,994
那些滴在你眼睛裡的狗屎鹽水
That saltwater shit you put in your eyes?

456
00:37:36,037 --> 00:37:38,872
- 你叫它們什麼? - 眼藥水
- What do you call that? - Bausch & Lomb.

457
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:42,042
那些狗屎眼藥水，是三百塊
Yeah, that bushy lawn shit. That's 300.

458
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:45,419
- 我要 - 對，你要。另外那個枕頭
- l need it. - Yeah, you do. And that extra pillow.

459
00:37:45,503 --> 00:37:48,672
我會幫你搞到，但要五百塊
I'm gonna get that for you, but that's gonna be like five C's.

460
00:37:48,756 --> 00:37:50,674
五百?
- Five? - Hey.

461
00:37:50,758 --> 00:37:54,177
標誌上說禁止講話，你們不識字嗎?
Sign says shut the fuck up, or can't you fellas read?

462
00:37:54,261 --> 00:37:56,429
你他媽的和誰講話?
Who the fuck you talkin' to, man?

463
00:37:57,723 --> 00:38:00,016
弗理，你有什麼問題嗎?
You got a problem over there, Foley?

464
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:05,229
這是我看過最笨的一個敲詐
Yeah, this is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dumb shakedowns.

465
00:38:05,313 --> 00:38:07,606
- 五百塊一個枕頭 - 對啊
- Five hundred bucks for a pillow? - That's right.

466
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:10,817
- 是有點太貴了 - 閉嘴，迪克
- lt does seem a little high, doesn't it? - Shut up, Dick.

467
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,028
- 一定是好枕頭 - 高級鵝毛的
- Must be a nice pillow. - Full goose down.

468
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:16,031
- 但是… - 你們一夥賺多少?
- Look, you still-- - How much for your company at chow?

469
00:38:16,073 --> 00:38:19,367
我們一夥?我得看著這狗娘養的
My company? Come on, man. You know l'll watch this motherfucker's back.

470
00:38:19,451 --> 00:38:22,120
- 多少? - 100塊。
- How much? - That's a C-note.

471
00:38:24,455 --> 00:38:27,207
瑞利，叫這傢伙滾開
lf you're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.

472
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,210
真的？
Really?

473
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:31,878
我不知道
Well, l-- l-- I don't know.

474
00:38:31,962 --> 00:38:35,298
他殺了你，什麼也得不到
First of all, if he kills you, then he's gonna get nothin'.

475
00:38:35,382 --> 00:38:38,718
不必殺他，弗理
Well, uh, the man don't just have to die, Foley.

476
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,805
他可能跌倒在硬東西上傷到自己
He could accidentally hurt himself falling down on something real hard.

477
00:38:42,889 --> 00:38:46,725
像刀或我的老二甚麼的
Like a shiv or my dick.

478
00:38:46,809 --> 00:38:49,478
我付錢。我付錢。別擔心
l'll pay. l'll pay it. Don't worry.

479
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:51,896
如果他跌倒，史努比
lf he falls on anything, Snoop,

480
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:55,733
他會很快被轉監。快到你想不到
then they're gonna transfer his ass outta here faster than you can throw a fight...

481
00:38:55,817 --> 00:38:58,069
你還是甚麼也得不到
and you're still gonna get nothin'.

482
00:38:58,111 --> 00:39:00,696
上次我查過
You know, last time l checked, man,

483
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:03,198
這與你無關
this shit over here ain't got nothin' to do with you.

484
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,034
出去抽根煙或甚麼的
Why don't you go outside? Smoke a cigarette or some shit.

485
00:39:06,076 --> 00:39:08,369
我不抽煙
I don't smoke.

486
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:11,206
你聽到他啦。快滾吧
You heard the man. Why don't you get your punk ass up outta here?

487
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:14,876
你慘了，那是海米
- Uh-oh. - You fucked up now, man. That's Himey.

488
00:39:14,918 --> 00:39:18,421
我的保鏢，這監獄的第32號狠人物
Protege of mine. Ranked number 32 in the federal prison system.

489
00:39:18,504 --> 00:39:20,422
- 32？ - 對
- Thirty-two? - That's right.

490
00:39:20,506 --> 00:39:23,091
- 在多少，20個人裡面? - 扁他。
- Out of, what, 20. - Kick this cracker's ass.

491
00:39:30,807 --> 00:39:33,017
- 這裡發生了甚麼事? - 沒事。
- What's going on here? - Uh, nothin'.

492
00:39:33,101 --> 00:39:36,729
在看「如何讀書」甚麼的結果大家都興奮起來了。
Just ''reading is fundamental'' shit. We got all excited and everything.

493
00:39:36,771 --> 00:39:38,772
全出去。現在
Clear outta here. Now.

494
00:39:38,814 --> 00:39:41,191
- 沒問題 - 全都走
- No problem. - All of you. Let's go.

495
00:39:45,493 --> 00:39:48,013
我想買魚的事定了 史努比
Uh, Snoopy. l think we settled the fish thing.

496
00:39:48,297 --> 00:39:50,215
這魚。喔!對不起……
Oh, the fish. Yeah.

497
00:40:01,225 --> 00:40:03,643
這是我們握手的方法，老弟
That's how you do the shake, partner.

498
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,652
報上說你們各懸賞一萬。 —奇諾和陸露。
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.

499
00:40:12,694 --> 00:40:14,654
他們有沒有提到凱倫
They say anything about Karen?

500
00:40:14,696 --> 00:40:16,656
只說她跑了
Just that she got away. Here.

501
00:40:16,698 --> 00:40:18,741
傑克
- Hmm? - Jack!

502
00:40:18,825 --> 00:40:20,743
沒關係
- Hey! - That's all right. It's in the pool.

503
00:40:20,827 --> 00:40:23,871
有沒有說她和葛蘭走了以後怎樣?
Did it say what happened to her after she took off with Glenn?

504
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:25,872
你得問葛蘭
I don't know. You'll have to ask Glenn.

505
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:28,625
他可能正在去底特律的路上。我們也該去
He's probably on his way to Detroit, which is where we should be.

506
00:40:28,667 --> 00:40:31,669
你知道你在幹麼嗎?
- Yeah. - Do you realize what you're doing?

507
00:40:31,753 --> 00:40:34,171
這女人是執法人員
Worrying about a woman who works for law enforcement?

508
00:40:34,214 --> 00:40:37,800
你想和對你開槍的女人喝雞尾酒?
You wanna sit down and have cocktails with a woman who tried to shoot you.

509
00:40:37,842 --> 00:40:41,094
- 你在聽嗎? - 你想這老傢伙是她男朋友?
- Do you hear what I'm saying? - Do you think this old guy's her boyfriend?

510
00:40:41,178 --> 00:40:43,096
只有這張相片
It's the only picture she has in here.

511
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,598
我一個人去底特律?
Am l going to Detroit by myself?

512
00:40:45,682 --> 00:40:47,850
待在這兒越久，就越可能……
The longer we stay here, the better chance there is...

513
00:40:47,934 --> 00:40:49,852
葛蘭可能搞砸
that either Glenn is gonna screw up the score,

514
00:40:49,936 --> 00:40:53,022
也可能我們被捕，或兩個都是
or we gonna get busted or both.

515
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,320
這是弗理?
This is Foley?

516
00:40:59,361 --> 00:41:01,779
凱倫?
- Karen? - Hmm?

517
00:41:01,864 --> 00:41:05,992
- 這是弗理?
- This is Foley? - How lucky can one guy be

518
00:41:06,034 --> 00:41:09,161
一點也不像……
Doesn't even look like that.

519
00:41:09,204 --> 00:41:13,040
- 不像? - 他看起來比較像……
- Oh, no? - Uh-uh. He looks a lot like--

520
00:41:15,501 --> 00:41:17,419
不一樣
Different.

521
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:25,217
懷特爾普來了
Wyatt Earp is here.

522
00:41:31,974 --> 00:41:33,892
- 嗨 - 嗨
- Hey. - Hey.

523
00:41:33,976 --> 00:41:36,394
- 感覺怎樣?好一點了嗎?  - 還好。
- How you feelin'? Feel better? - Good. Yeah.

524
00:41:36,478 --> 00:41:39,439
- 你父親照顧你?  - 他請假一禮拜…
- ls your dad taking good care of you? - He took the week off...

525
00:41:39,523 --> 00:41:43,067
想照顧我，但他卻只在修他的船。
to take care of me and he's worked on his boat every day since.

526
00:41:43,151 --> 00:41:45,444
- 這是雷尼可 - 嗨
- Dad, this is Ray Nicolet. - Hi.

527
00:41:45,528 --> 00:41:48,906
- 我聽了好多關於你的事 - 彼此彼此
- Pleasure to meet you. l heard a lot about you. - Likewise.

528
00:41:48,948 --> 00:41:52,367
雷正與調查局特勤小組一同調查越獄案
Ray's working with the F.B.l. task force on the prison break.

529
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:56,287
告訴我，雷，你有沒有穿過「便衣」字樣的衣服?
l see that. Tell me, Ray, do you ever wear one that says ''undercover''?

530
00:41:58,957 --> 00:42:01,500
- 沒有 - 事情進展如何?
- No. - How's it going?

531
00:42:01,584 --> 00:42:03,502
坐下來
Sit down.

532
00:42:03,586 --> 00:42:07,089
不錯。我們捉到其中一個
Okay. Good. We caught one of them.

533
00:42:07,214 --> 00:42:09,174
- 是弗理嗎? - 從線民的線索來的
- Was it Foley? - Was it off a tip?

534
00:42:09,258 --> 00:42:12,761
有人在機場附近看到他們倆個
Somebody spotted two of them out in this hobo camp near the airport.

535
00:42:12,803 --> 00:42:14,929
打了報案電話
Called in the number. That was it.

536
00:42:15,013 --> 00:42:17,932
- 是懸賞起了作用 - 是弗理嗎?
- l knew it as soon as l as there was a reward. - Was it Foley?

537
00:42:18,016 --> 00:42:21,018
不是，是裡納茲，古巴幫中的一個
No, Linares, one of the Cubans.

538
00:42:21,102 --> 00:42:24,563
我們與霹靂小組，兩架直升機一起攻進去，
We went in there with full SWAT, two choppers, that whole deal.

539
00:42:24,605 --> 00:42:27,065
裡納茲開始開槍，所以我們先逮他
Linares goes nuts, starts shooting, so we took him out.

540
00:42:27,107 --> 00:42:30,068
奇諾溜了
I don't know how Chirino got away, but he did.

541
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:33,112
- 弗理不在現場 - 只有古巴人而已
- And Foley hadn't been there. - No, this place was strictly Cuban.

542
00:42:33,196 --> 00:42:37,408
弗理搭了車，他一定另有計劃
Foley had a ride. He must have his own agenda. You know what l mean?

543
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:40,786
他好像是唯一知道自己在幹什麼的人
He seems to be the only guy who kinda knows what he's doing.

544
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:42,788
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

545
00:42:42,872 --> 00:42:45,499
對不起
- Excuse me. - Yeah.

546
00:42:45,582 --> 00:42:47,583
喂？
Hello?

547
00:42:47,626 --> 00:42:50,295
她在，請等一下
Yeah, she is. Just a minute, please.

548
00:42:50,378 --> 00:42:52,296
凱倫
Karen.

549
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:55,174
- 喂？ - 嗨!
- Hello? - Hi.

550
00:42:56,634 --> 00:43:00,178
你知道我是誰嗎?
You know who this is?

551
00:43:00,262 --> 00:43:03,514
知道。五分鐘
Yes. Five minutes.

552
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:12,148
那麼，雷
So. Ray.

553
00:43:12,231 --> 00:43:14,941
有些事我感到奇怪
- Yeah. - There's something I'm wondering.

554
00:43:14,984 --> 00:43:18,862
報紙標題說有個邁阿密女人說她同殺人犯睡覺
The headline reads, ''l slept with a murderer, says shaken Miami woman.''

555
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:22,115
- 誰接的電話 - 與你無關
- Who is it that answered the phone? - None of your business.

556
00:43:22,157 --> 00:43:25,076
可能對你來說我還不夠成熟
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.

557
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,621
- 那是我父親 - 真的?
- lt was my dad. - Really?

558
00:43:28,663 --> 00:43:32,666
- 他一臉警察相 - 你怎麼會知道?
- He's got a cop's face. - How do you know?

559
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:36,503
- 你拿了我的皮夾 - 還有你的槍
- Oh, wait. You have my wallet. - And your gun.

560
00:43:36,587 --> 00:43:38,964
- 我可以拿回來嗎?  - 要怎麼做?
- Think l can have 'em back? - How do we do that?

561
00:43:39,006 --> 00:43:41,967
來我父親家，丟在他那裡
You can come by my dad's place and drop 'em off.

562
00:43:42,008 --> 00:43:44,843
我乾脆給應門的霹靂小組特警算了
l could leave it with the SWAT guy that answers the door.

563
00:43:44,928 --> 00:43:47,680
現在有個特勤小組的傢伙在這裡
There's a guy here on the task force right now.

564
00:43:47,722 --> 00:43:50,265
也許我該讓他講
Maybe l should put him on the phone and let the two of you work it out.

565
00:43:50,349 --> 00:43:52,517
- 你不會這樣做 - 為什麼不？
- You wouldn't do that. - Why not?

566
00:43:52,601 --> 00:43:56,187
你玩得很愉快嘛
Because you're having too much fun.

567
00:43:56,271 --> 00:43:58,189
她替他煮了豬排飯
She fixes him pork chops and rice.

568
00:43:58,273 --> 00:44:01,025
接著，他們就在沙發上做愛
The next thing you know, they're making love on the sofa.

569
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:03,110
她說他很溫柔
She says he was very gentle.

570
00:44:03,194 --> 00:44:06,947
奇裡諾來了，說他想他的小女人
This guy, Chirino, shows up at the house, says he misses his little girl.

571
00:44:07,031 --> 00:44:10,659
她覺得對不起他。接著…砰
She feels sorry for him. Next thing you know-- boom.

572
00:44:10,701 --> 00:44:13,745
- 在沙發上 - 這就是你們目前的進展?
- On the couch. - That's how you score now, huh?

573
00:44:15,288 --> 00:44:17,206
是吧
l guess.

574
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:19,375
我一直在想些事
There's something l've been wondering.

575
00:44:19,417 --> 00:44:21,543
你的卡利叔呢?
Whatever happened to your Uncle Cully?

576
00:44:21,586 --> 00:44:23,963
希望他告訴你我在哪?
You think he's gonna tell you where l am?

577
00:44:24,046 --> 00:44:26,881
- 除非你要 - 他死了
- Unless you wanna tell me. - He's dead.

578
00:44:26,924 --> 00:44:28,884
坐了27年車
Did 27 years before he got out,

579
00:44:28,926 --> 00:44:32,053
出獄幾年後，死在慈善醫院
and he died a couple of years afterwards in a charity hospital...

580
00:44:32,095 --> 00:44:34,889
彌補所有他錯過的好時光
by trying to make up for all the good times he missed.

581
00:44:34,973 --> 00:44:37,058
我絕不會那麼做
That's not gonna be me.

582
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:41,061
最後一搏，退休到某小島?是嘛?
What, one last score, retire to some island? ls that the idea?

583
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:43,772
- 傑克 - 我本身偏愛山區
- Jack. - I'm partial to mountains myself,

584
00:44:43,856 --> 00:44:46,483
不過你喜歡小島，我們就去小島
but if you like islands, we'll make it an island.

585
00:44:46,567 --> 00:44:50,737
- 「我們」是指? - 我和你可以…
- What do you mean, ''we'll make it an island''? - You and l can make it--

586
00:44:50,779 --> 00:44:53,239
- 你最好來看看 - 那是巴蒂嗎?
- Jack, you better come and check this out. - ls that Buddy?

587
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:56,033
- 什麼?好 - 拜拜
- What? No. Okay. Bye-bye. - Who're you talking to?

588
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:59,828
- 所以，她已婚了 - 正確
- So she's a married woman. - Right.

589
00:44:59,912 --> 00:45:02,414
她和逃犯上床，因為……
But she goes to bed with a prison escapee because...

590
00:45:02,498 --> 00:45:05,083
他說他想念他的小女人
he tells her that he misses his little girl.

591
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:08,127
她告訴全世界的人，但你卻保護她
She tells the world about it. But you protect her.

592
00:45:08,211 --> 00:45:11,046
你沒洩漏她的姓名
You don't reveal her name.

593
00:45:11,089 --> 00:45:13,799
聽起來她做得不錯
That makes it sound like what she was doing was okay...

594
00:45:13,883 --> 00:45:16,009
只要她老公沒發現
as long as her husband doesn't find out.

595
00:45:16,093 --> 00:45:20,763
就像偷腥的傢伙說老婆不知情就不受傷
Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't bother her.

596
00:45:20,806 --> 00:45:22,766
- 爸  - 幹嘛？
- Dad. - What?

597
00:45:29,939 --> 00:45:33,066
雷，讓你看個東西。在客廳裡。
Ray, l wanna show you something... in the living room.

598
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:36,778
很高興跟你聊天
- Yeah. - Good talking to you, Ray.

599
00:45:36,904 --> 00:45:38,780
我也是
Yeah, you too.

600
00:45:42,784 --> 00:45:45,244
今天早上，聯邦警察臨檢一個在邁阿密
Federal law enforcement agents raided a squatters' camp...

601
00:45:45,286 --> 00:45:47,955
國際機場北邊的流浪漢聚所
north of Miami lnternational Airport this morning...

602
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:53,293
搜尋週二從葛雷茲監獄脫逃的逃犯
in the hopes of capturing a fugitive from Tuesday's daring escape from Glades prison.

603
00:45:53,377 --> 00:45:57,213
其中一名，奧裡李納茲
F.B.l. officials confirm that one of the escapees, Arelio Linares,

604
00:45:57,297 --> 00:45:59,924
- 被殺死 - 奇諾會找我。
- was killed-- - Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.

605
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:03,260
奇諾忙著逃命，根本不甩你
Chino's runnin' for his life. He don't give a shit about you.

606
00:46:03,303 --> 00:46:07,139
他會知道我放棄他了。他會要找我
He's gonna know by now l gave him up back at Glades. He's gonna wanna find me.

607
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:10,100
也許問阿黛兒。看她知道什麼?
Maybe see Adele, see what she knows.

608
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,894
他知道她住哪?
He knows where she lives?

609
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:15,647
傑克！
Jack!

610
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,690
我們曾一起聊天喝過酒
We were talking once, drinking rum,

611
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:20,818
我可能提過她
and l may have mentioned Adele.

612
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:23,362
她曾替魔術師工作過。他很感興趣
How she worked for a magician. Chino got all interested.

613
00:46:23,446 --> 00:46:26,073
他說，「你怎麼把女人鋸成兩半？」
He said, ''How do you saw the woman in half?''

614
00:46:26,157 --> 00:46:29,409
當她來探監時，他想見見她
Maybe he wanted to meet her, maybe see her if she came to visit.

615
00:46:29,493 --> 00:46:32,954
所以你打了電話。要她不要跟古巴幫講話
Oh, okay, okay. So you call her up and tell her don't talk to any Cubans.

616
00:46:32,996 --> 00:46:36,207
- 電話可能被監聽了  - 沒錯
- The phone's probably tapped by now. - You're right.

617
00:46:36,291 --> 00:46:38,709
就是說她被監視了
And if the phone is tapped, you know they have her place staked out.

618
00:46:38,793 --> 00:46:40,544
該死
Shit!

619
00:46:43,047 --> 00:46:45,007
阿黛兒 德利西
Adele Delisi speaking.

620
00:46:45,049 --> 00:46:48,301
- 是阿黛兒嗎? - 是啊!
- Uh, uh, this is Adele? - Yes, it is.

621
00:46:48,343 --> 00:46:50,303
抱歉 打錯了
Oh-- Uh, sorry. Wrong number.

622
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,112
喬裝得不錯
Nice disguise.

623
00:47:09,196 --> 00:47:11,114
我是個觀光客
I'm a tourist.

624
00:47:12,949 --> 00:47:15,701
你看
All right. Here we go.

625
00:47:15,785 --> 00:47:19,955
前面這裡左手邊
Coming up right here... on the left.

626
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:23,208
- 那個剪樹叢的傢伙? - 我想聯邦調查局…
- What about the guy with the clippers? - l wonder what the F.B.l...

627
00:47:23,292 --> 00:47:25,919
剪樹叢要收多少錢?
is charging to trim hedges these days?

628
00:47:26,002 --> 00:47:30,214
- 棋下得有模有樣 - 靠邊停
- Quite a checker game they got goin' on too. - Pull on up.

629
00:47:53,694 --> 00:47:55,904
噢!天啊
Oh, man.

630
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:04,703
噢!天啊
Oh, man.

631
00:48:04,746 --> 00:48:06,831
你看得到卻得不到
Okay, you saw her. That's all you get.

632
00:48:12,878 --> 00:48:16,506
- 我們去底特律吧 - 你總算說了句人話
- Let's go to Detroit. - Now you're talkin', brother.

633
00:48:18,258 --> 00:48:21,093
我得替傑克說句話，他很體貼
l'll say one thing for Jack-- he's very considerate.

634
00:48:21,177 --> 00:48:23,178
嗯，時好時壞的
Lights on or off, if you know what l mean.

635
00:48:23,263 --> 00:48:25,097
是啊
- Really. - Hmm.

636
00:48:28,184 --> 00:48:30,644
阿黛兒，聽著
Adele, listen--

637
00:48:30,686 --> 00:48:35,440
我只是想在事情搞得更糟前找到他
l just want to find him before he does something else and makes it worse on himself.

638
00:48:35,524 --> 00:48:39,402
巴蒂會照顧他
No. Buddy'll take care of him.

639
00:48:39,486 --> 00:48:43,155
不讓他惹麻煩。他是傑克的良知
Keep him out of trouble. He's Jack's conscience, always has been.

640
00:48:43,197 --> 00:48:46,950
他們大概一起搶過50家銀行
They must have robbed 50 banks together.

641
00:48:47,034 --> 00:48:50,829
- 是最佳拍檔 - 直到他們被抓
- They were a really great team. - Until they got busted.

642
00:48:50,871 --> 00:48:53,748
那不是傑克的錯，那是因為……
Hmm. That wasn't Jack's fault. No, that was on account of...

643
00:48:53,832 --> 00:48:58,461
巴蒂。他決定在他們行動之前
Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to the job...

644
00:48:58,544 --> 00:49:00,879
向他姊姊坦白
before they'd done it instead of after.

645
00:49:00,922 --> 00:49:05,551
她打給聯邦調查局。結果兩個都進了蘭坡
Well, she called the F.B.l. They both went down, and they ended up at Lompoc.

646
00:49:05,634 --> 00:49:08,678
我想巴蒂有點愧疚
l think Buddy felt kind of bad about that.

647
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:13,015
阿黛兒，你知道在哪兒可找到巴蒂?
Adele, do you have any idea where l could find Buddy?

648
00:49:13,058 --> 00:49:17,186
或葛蘭?
Or Glenn?

649
00:49:17,228 --> 00:49:19,771
米拉，阿黛兒，在嗎?
Mira, Adele, you in there?

650
00:49:19,855 --> 00:49:23,024
-在  -米拉，我想和你談談
-Yes. -Mira, l'd like to speak to you, please.

- 你是誰? - 伊米。你以前的老闆
- Well, who is it? - Emile, you know, the guy you used to work for?

652
00:49:26,445 --> 00:49:29,531
給我你的電話和地址
- Uh-- - He gave me your number and where you live.

653
00:49:29,572 --> 00:49:33,116
米拉 我在找助理。我能和你談談嗎?
Mira, I'm looking for an assistant. Can l speak to you, please?

654
00:49:33,201 --> 00:49:36,036
好
- Oh. Uh, yeah. - All right.

655
00:49:36,078 --> 00:49:38,079
你替伊米工作過?
You did work for Emile, right?

656
00:49:38,122 --> 00:49:41,291
我當過伊米四年的盒裝美人
Uh, yeah, l was Emile's box jumper for four years, almost.

657
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,293
你是什麼?他的盒子?
Cono! You were what, his box?

658
00:49:43,377 --> 00:49:45,378
他的助理
- Uh, his assistant. - Oh, okay.

659
00:49:47,464 --> 00:49:49,882
你說你在邁阿密表演?
You say you perform in the Miami area?

660
00:49:49,924 --> 00:49:52,801
到處都去
Oh, si. Here, there, you know.

661
00:49:52,885 --> 00:49:56,471
我在古巴是魔術師。他們都叫我「蠻牛」魔術師
l was a magician in Cuba. They used to call me Manuelito the Magician.

662
00:49:56,555 --> 00:49:58,640
米拉，開個門
Mira, can you please open?

663
00:49:58,724 --> 00:50:02,519
- 我沒穿衣服 - 我是傑克弗理的好友
- I'm not dressed. - I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.

664
00:50:02,602 --> 00:50:06,105
- 你認識傑克?  - 你是誰?
- You know Jack? - Who are you?

665
00:50:06,189 --> 00:50:08,274
荷西奇裡諾
Jose Chirino.

666
00:50:08,357 --> 00:50:12,444
也許你聽過傑克叫我奇諾。我就是
Or maybe you heard Jack call me Chino. Bueno, I'm the same guy.

667
00:50:12,528 --> 00:50:15,614
叫他等等：你要穿衣服
Tell him he has to wait in the hall. You have to get dressed. Say it loud.

668
00:50:15,697 --> 00:50:17,949
在外面等。你要穿衣服
Wait in the hall. You have to get dressed.

669
00:50:17,991 --> 00:50:21,452
告訴我哪裡找得到傑克，我就不再煩你
Mira, mira, you tell me where l could find Jack and I don't bother you no more.

670
00:50:21,536 --> 00:50:24,121
好啦！拜託
Now, come on, please! Hello?

671
00:50:24,205 --> 00:50:27,749
- 我不知道他在哪 - 我幫過傑克逃獄
- I don't know where he is. - I'm the guy that helped Jack escape from prison.

672
00:50:27,792 --> 00:50:31,420
- 米拉, 打開這該死的門…… - 我要叫警察了
- Mira, please open this fucking door-- - I'm gonna call the police.

673
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:36,549
為什麼要那樣對傑克的朋友?
Cono, why you gonna do that to a friend, man? A partner to Jack?

674
00:50:37,926 --> 00:50:40,720
夠了
That's it! That's it!

675
00:50:47,726 --> 00:50:51,354
米拉。拜託！
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Cono, mira, please!

676
00:50:51,438 --> 00:50:53,356
- 阿黛爾！阿黛爾！ - 手給我
- Adele! Adele! - Give me your hand.

677
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,317
- 你不是阿黛爾 - 聯邦警察，你被拘捕了
- You not Adele! - I'm a federal marshal, and you're under arrest.

678
00:50:56,401 --> 00:50:59,362
把皮包給我，阿黛兒
- Get my bag, Adele. - Oh.

679
00:50:59,445 --> 00:51:01,488
我想這有些誤會
Mira, please, please. l think there's a misunderstanding here.

680
00:51:01,531 --> 00:51:03,491
好皮包
Can you-- you got nice bag.

681
00:51:03,574 --> 00:51:07,327
這件事就算了吧。我回家……
Mira, let's say we just forget about it, okay? We forget about this, l go home--

682
00:51:07,411 --> 00:51:10,455
- 閉嘴！ - 誰該死地教你那樣做?
- Shut up. - Owwww! Who the hell taught you how to do that?

683
00:51:10,497 --> 00:51:12,623
- 另一隻手給我 - 好
- Give me your other hand. - Okay, okay. Ay, cono.

684
00:51:12,666 --> 00:51:15,460
我得去小便
Ohhhh! l gotta go make pee-pee.

685
00:51:15,502 --> 00:51:18,296
Ohhhhh! Owww!
Ohhhhh! Owww!

686
00:51:18,337 --> 00:51:20,839
你好過份
Wow! You are mean!

687
00:51:20,881 --> 00:51:25,301
我要找律師。你侵犯我的人權
Look, I'm gonna call my lawyer. This is-- What do they call that? Human rights violation.

688
00:51:25,344 --> 00:51:28,513
- 丹尼爾伯波頓 - 凱倫西思柯
- Ay, cono. - Daniel Burdon, please. Karen Sisco.

689
00:51:28,597 --> 00:51:31,349
米拉, 阿黛兒 可以問個問題嗎
Mira, Adele, Adele. Can l ask you a question, please?

690
00:51:31,433 --> 00:51:33,851
記得你表演的那個魔術嗎?
You know that trick you do?

691
00:51:33,935 --> 00:51:37,396
凱倫?你在哪?我一直在找你
Karen? Where are you? l've been trying to reach you.

692
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,732
他們把你鋸成一半時
When you in the box and they saw you in half?

693
00:51:39,815 --> 00:51:42,859
- 我在阿黛兒德利西家 - 是魔術呀
- I'm at Adele Delisi's. - It's magic.

694
00:51:42,901 --> 00:51:45,361
我們已經找過她啦 死巷一條
We already talked to her. That's a dead end.

695
00:51:45,404 --> 00:51:50,074
如果我帶奇裡諾回去，你會讓我加入特勤小組?
l was just wondering, if l brought in Chirino, would you let me be on the task force?

696
00:51:50,158 --> 00:51:52,535
- 當然 - 他們插入鋸子，再分開盒子
- Yeah, sure, Karen. - Then they put the saw through, and they separate it.

697
00:51:52,618 --> 00:51:56,329
不過你怎麼動腳趾頭?
- And that's it. Ta da. - But how do you twinkle your toes? I don't get that.

698
00:51:56,372 --> 00:51:59,750
如果你帶奇裡諾回來，就可以加入特勤小組
You bring Chirino in, and you can be on the task force.

699
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:02,418
- 這就是我想知道的 - 好
- That's all l wanted to know. - Good.

700
00:52:02,502 --> 00:52:05,713
別管那個前妻了
Now, would you forget about the ex-wife,

701
00:52:05,797 --> 00:52:08,174
回亞當斯旅館去
and get over to the Adams Hotel?

702
00:52:08,216 --> 00:52:10,885
知道了
- You got it. - Then they open it up--

703
00:52:10,968 --> 00:52:13,678
不！
- No! No! - Come on.

704
00:52:13,721 --> 00:52:17,557
- 就這樣而已 - 是假腳
- And then that's it. - Fake legs.

705
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,018
假腳? 那你怎麼……
- Mmm. - Fake legs? How you gonna--

706
00:52:21,061 --> 00:52:23,604
- 謝啦, 阿黛兒
- Ay! Cono. - Thanks, Adele.

707
00:52:23,688 --> 00:52:25,898
如果是假腳，怎麼能動呢?
How do they twinkle their toes, then, if it's fake, mira?

708
00:52:26,123 --> 00:52:28,318
亞當斯旅館

709
00:52:29,151 --> 00:52:31,820
我們到底特律第一件事就是找葛蘭
First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn,

710
00:52:31,904 --> 00:52:34,990
然後把他扔出窗去
and we find a window to throw him out of.

711
00:52:35,073 --> 00:52:36,991
我想，如果我是葛蘭……
l was thinkin', if l was Glenn, and l was up there...

712
00:52:37,075 --> 00:52:39,076
動了瑞利的腦筋，會去哪裡
to take down the Ripper, where would l go?

713
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:42,121
但如果你是葛蘭，就根本不會動腦筋
'Cept that if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinkin'.

714
00:52:42,205 --> 00:52:44,248
記得史努比米勒，他的好兄弟?
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from the joint?

715
00:52:44,332 --> 00:52:47,084
史努比，我以為他早已死了
Snoop? l figured he'd be brain-dead by now.

716
00:52:47,168 --> 00:52:49,253
史努比不再打拳了
Nah, Snoop doesn't box anymore.

717
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:52,171
葛蘭說他在克朗克做幾個拳擊手的經紀人
Glenn told me that he's managing some fighters out at the Kronk.

718
00:53:07,394 --> 00:53:09,937
- 拿到鑰匙了? - 他們在613房
- Did you get the key? - They're in room 613.

719
00:53:12,732 --> 00:53:16,110
兩個人在外面，守著前後門
All right. l want two men outside, front and back.

720
00:53:16,194 --> 00:53:20,906
康諾、傑森，上六樓，掩護走廊兩端。
Conroy, Jamison, go on up to six, cover both ends of the hall.

721
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:24,659
你先走，你殿後
You're primary. You're secondary.

722
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:27,203
你把哨
And you're point man.

723
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:30,956
- 你要用撞門樁嗎? - 對。幹嘛?
- You gonna use a ram? - Yeah. Why?

724
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,251
經理的門是鐵的
The manager's door is metal.

725
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,336
說不定全是
You know what l mean, they might all be.

726
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,714
樁打在鐵門上製造噪音而已
A ram on a metal door makes a lot of noise for what good it does.

727
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:41,633
我的6A746727里有破鎖彈
l got a shock lock round for my shotgun that oughta do the trick.

728
00:53:41,717 --> 00:53:43,635
好。隨便
Fine. Whatever.

729
00:53:54,312 --> 00:53:56,230
二樓。謝謝
Two, please.

730
00:53:58,524 --> 00:54:00,484
你
You.

731
00:54:04,571 --> 00:54:08,783
走樓梯吧
Fuck it. Let's take the stairs. Karen--

732
00:54:08,825 --> 00:54:11,994
待在大廳，監視電梯
Take the radio. Stay down here in the lobby and watch the elevator.

733
00:54:12,078 --> 00:54:15,914
- 丹尼爾，我要上去 - 你要待在車上也行
- Daniel, l want to go upstairs. - Well, you can wait in the car if you want to.

734
00:54:17,583 --> 00:54:20,544
如果你看到弗理和柏格出現，你會怎麼做?
Now, you see Foley and Bragg coming behind us. What do you do?

735
00:54:20,627 --> 00:54:24,547
- 呼叫你嗎? - 然後讓他們上來
- Call and tell you? - And you let them come up.

736
00:54:24,631 --> 00:54:28,134
不要自行逮捕他們。明白嗎?
You don't try to make the bust yourself. You understand?

737
00:54:34,306 --> 00:54:36,558
是這樓嗎，女士?
ls this your floor, ma'am?

738
00:54:37,809 --> 00:54:39,727
是這樓嗎，女士?
ls this your floor, ma'am?

739
00:54:39,811 --> 00:54:42,688
噢，是的
Oh. Oh, yes.

740
00:54:42,772 --> 00:54:45,607
抱歉。謝謝
Yes, it is. I'm sorry. Thank you.

741
00:54:49,195 --> 00:54:52,447
注意，我們接近目標門口了
Be advised we are approaching the door.

742
00:55:00,705 --> 00:55:04,708
注意，要炸開門了
Be advised we are going to blow the door.

743
00:55:14,467 --> 00:55:16,385
上樓嗎?
Going up?

744
00:55:31,525 --> 00:55:33,860
我以為是上樓
Shit, l thought l was going up.

745
00:55:35,486 --> 00:55:38,405
她一直注視著我
She just looked right at me.

746
00:55:38,447 --> 00:55:41,658
- 誰？ - 凱倫
- Who? - Karen.

747
00:55:41,742 --> 00:55:45,245
凱倫西斯柯?
- Karen Sisco? - Yeah.

748
00:55:45,329 --> 00:55:47,330
她在大廳
She's in the lobby.

749
00:55:47,414 --> 00:55:49,332
- 她在大廳？ - 對。
- She's in the lobby? - Yeah.

750
00:55:51,167 --> 00:55:54,461
如果他們知道我住哪，就知道我開什麼車。 我們得棄車
They know where l live, no doubt they know what l drive. We gotta dump this car.

751
00:56:03,303 --> 00:56:05,513
她就坐在那，看著我
She just sat there, looking right at me.

752
00:56:10,101 --> 00:56:14,104
他們不在上面。睜大眼睛
Karen, they're not up here. Keep your eyes open.

753
00:56:15,147 --> 00:56:18,483
凱倫，你在聽嗎？
Karen? Karen, are you there?

754
00:56:19,443 --> 00:56:21,361
跟你揮手？
He waved at you?

755
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:23,282
我肯定他有
Couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.

756
00:56:23,365 --> 00:56:25,454
- 你也揮手了？ - 來不及了
- Did you wave back? - l didn't have time.

757
00:56:25,539 --> 00:56:27,543
可是我想你會的
l imagine you would have, though.

758
00:56:29,049 --> 00:56:31,012
巴蒂的姊姊，維珍柏格
Buddy's sister, Regina Mary Bragg,

759
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,017
今早接到兩通巴蒂從底特律打的電話
got two calls from Buddy in Detroit this morning.

760
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:35,566
她通知波頓
She calls Burdon. She's also the one who called Burdon...

761
00:56:35,609 --> 00:56:37,948
- 他還拿到巴蒂的住址 - 又怎樣?
- and gave him Buddy's address. - So?

762
00:56:38,033 --> 00:56:41,291
在她告發他後，為什麼還跟她聯絡?
So what l want to know is why he still calls her even after she turned him in.

763
00:56:41,376 --> 00:56:43,423
他不記恨嘛
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge. What l want to know is why,

764
00:56:43,465 --> 00:56:48,311
如果他們在北方有大計劃，為什麼弗理待在邁阿密這麼久
they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?

765
00:56:48,395 --> 00:56:51,402
- 你覺得呢？ - 我不想說
- Any thoughts on that? - None l'd like to share.

766
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:54,996
- 回來後我再打電話給你  - 好吧
- l'll call you when l get in. - Okay.

767
00:56:58,374 --> 00:57:00,750
底特律

768
00:57:02,311 --> 00:57:05,151
Hey

769
00:57:20,697 --> 00:57:24,247
真浪費時間
Time is truly wasting

770
00:57:24,332 --> 00:57:28,844
我不單只做買賣和管理拳擊手
You know, I don't just deal product and manage fighters no more.

771
00:57:28,887 --> 00:57:33,566
從上次見面後，很多事都變了
A lot's changed since the last time you seen me, man. It's like l've, uh,

772
00:57:33,608 --> 00:57:36,407
我把自己變得多元化
vertically integrated myself, you know, diversified and shit,

773
00:57:36,449 --> 00:57:38,453
我偶爾會偷東西
and now I'm into the occasional grand larceny,

774
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,837
闖空門，做那些鳥事
- home invasion, shit like that. - Huh.

775
00:57:40,921 --> 00:57:43,093
白波是我這裡的跑腿
White Boy Bob right there's my all-around man, you know.

776
00:57:43,178 --> 00:57:48,233
需要時，還可以是保鏢、司機
He's my personal bodyguard when l feel like l need one, driver, shit like that.

777
00:57:48,276 --> 00:57:50,823
小心看路啊，白波!幹嘛回頭?
Yo, man, watch the road, White Boy! What you lookin' back here for?

778
00:57:50,908 --> 00:57:55,003
- 耶 - 耶
- Yeah. - Yeah.

779
00:57:55,087 --> 00:57:57,008
我喜歡這部車，葛蘭
- l like this car, Glenn. - Yeah.

780
00:57:57,092 --> 00:57:59,181
你偷了部好車，小子
You stole a good one, boy.

781
00:57:59,265 --> 00:58:02,314
我們可以在瑞利家附近繞……
You can roll around in Ripley's neighborhood up there in Bloomfield Hills,

782
00:58:02,399 --> 00:58:04,320
不用怕私人警衛
not get sweated by the private security.

783
00:58:04,405 --> 00:58:07,329
不會有警察當跟屁蟲。不錯吧
Ain't gonna have no police on our ass, nothing like that. It's nice, man.

784
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,463
是!
Yeah.

785
00:58:10,505 --> 00:58:13,512
你還沒說要怎麼幹這件事
Oh, hey, so you still haven't said how you want to do this thing.

786
00:58:13,598 --> 00:58:17,984
接到另一個兄弟後，我就一起講
Oh, I'm gonna tell you that as soon as we get one other brother I'm gonna need, uh,

787
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:19,990
肯尼，那是墨塞的弟弟……
Kenneth-- that's Moselle's brother--

788
00:58:20,033 --> 00:58:23,500
跟白波一道
along with White Boy right there.

789
00:58:23,543 --> 00:58:25,339
- 什麼！ - 到了，白波
- What? - All right, here we go, White Boy.

790
00:58:35,285 --> 00:58:37,749
那個消防員是誰？
Uh, who's the fireman?

791
00:58:39,797 --> 00:58:43,097
肯尼那狗小子
Ken dog.

792
00:58:43,141 --> 00:58:45,230
- 嘿? - 怎麼樣，大老千?
- What's up, brother-in-law? - What's happenin', hustler?

793
00:58:47,027 --> 00:58:49,533
你怕聞煙味?
Hey, man. This cigarette gonna bother you, Mo?

794
00:58:49,618 --> 00:58:53,628
熄了它。肯尼，這是葛蘭
Yeah, put that thing out, all right? Ken, this is Glenn.

795
00:58:53,713 --> 00:58:56,930
葛蘭，這是肯尼，我跟你提過的傢伙
- Glenn, that's Kenny, the dude l was tellin' you about. - Hi.

796
00:58:56,972 --> 00:59:00,356
你就是那個要幫我們打劫有錢白佬的人
You're the one gonna help us rip off that rich white dude?

797
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,907
- 就是他 - 幫你?
- Yeah, that's him. - Help you?

798
00:59:03,992 --> 00:59:06,206
開車，白波
Go ahead, White Boy.

799
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:14,438
等等，看……
Um, whoa, wait a minute, um, look--

800
00:59:14,522 --> 00:59:18,950
莫瑞，是我讓你加入計劃
Maurice, l am letting you in on this gig,

801
00:59:19,035 --> 00:59:21,499
不是……
not--

802
00:59:21,542 --> 00:59:24,048
你剛問我們要怎麼做
- You just asked how we gonna do it, right? - Yeah.

803
00:59:24,091 --> 00:59:26,054
我現在告訴你。我們是專家
Well, I'm telling you how, man. We the experts.

804
00:59:27,809 --> 00:59:29,730
我擔心的是你，葛蘭
Person I'm worried about is you, Glenn.

805
00:59:29,815 --> 00:59:32,572
我？
- Me? - Yeah.

806
00:59:32,616 --> 00:59:36,376
你真的可以幹這檔子事，還是說說而已?
Can you step up and actually do this shit instead of just talking the talk?

807
00:59:37,588 --> 00:59:39,468
幹什麼？
Do what?

808
00:59:39,468 --> 00:59:41,845
打劫我挑中的房子
Walk into this house l got picked out.

809
00:59:41,887 --> 00:59:44,472
幹掉這個以前我和他交易過的黑鬼人妖
Do this cross-dressing nigger named Eddie Solomon l used to sell to.

810
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:48,434
- 他自己做買賣 - 什麼事？甚麼時候？
- Been dealing on his own. - What? When, man?

811
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:51,687
現在。你以為做這檔子事是幹嘛?
Shit, right now, son. What you think all this shit is for?

812
00:59:51,772 --> 00:59:54,858
我不用向你證明什麼
I don't need to prove shit to you, man, okay?

813
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:58,194
瑞利的事是我的事。要不要做隨你
The Ripley job is my job. You're either in or you're not.

814
00:59:58,236 --> 01:00:01,906
你想揍惹你生氣的毒販
You wanna go pop some crack dealer pissed you off, man,

815
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:04,993
那是你的問題，不是我的
- that is your problem, not mine, fuck! - Glenn,

816
01:00:05,035 --> 01:00:07,037
我知道你酷
l know you supposed to be cool and everything, okay,

817
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:09,122
但不要用這種口氣對我說話
but you ain't got to give me no tone of voice.

818
01:00:09,206 --> 01:00:13,251
你不高興我說的隨時可以走
You don't like what I'm sayin', you just bounce the fuck out this whip anywhere up in here.

819
01:00:13,335 --> 01:00:17,464
我想我們都忘了這是我的事
Okay, l think we're forgetting that this is my whip.

820
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:22,593
我提起的
l brought it up.

821
01:00:22,678 --> 01:00:28,266
聽著。我說這是我的車，就是我的
Shit. Hey, come on, man. lf l say this is my car, you know this is my car.

822
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:30,685
你自己去找另一部
You just get yourself another one.

823
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:34,147
不管你要不要，我們都決定進行
lf l say we in on this Ripley shit, we in on it, with or without your punk ass.

824
01:00:34,231 --> 01:00:36,900
如果我要你幹掉這個混蛋
And if l say you gonna walk up in this house and do this motherfucker...

825
01:00:36,984 --> 01:00:38,944
來證明你有種
so l can see if you got any balls or not,

826
01:00:39,027 --> 01:00:41,320
你猜你該怎麼做?
guess what else you gonna do?

827
01:00:41,405 --> 01:00:43,532
到了
We're here.

828
01:00:44,742 --> 01:00:48,203
綁緊褲子，小子
Tighten up your panties, boy.

829
01:00:50,247 --> 01:00:53,416
鐵鋸。我來拿
- Hacksaw. Okay, l'll take that. - Oh, yeah.

830
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,835
斧頭
- Hatchet, man. - Hatchet?

831
01:00:55,919 --> 01:00:59,756
拿斧頭幹嘛
What are you gonna do with a hatchet?

832
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:03,134
去好好修理那混蛋
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's get some fire to that ass.

833
01:01:03,302 --> 01:01:05,762
你要．45口徑還是手槍?
Look here. You want the .45 or the Glock?

834
01:01:08,182 --> 01:01:10,100
葛蘭？
Glenn?

835
01:01:47,471 --> 01:01:49,431
狗屎，小子
Shit, boy.

836
01:02:01,152 --> 01:02:03,445
比你想得更糟，對吧？
lt was worse than you thought it was gonna be, huh?

837
01:02:05,364 --> 01:02:07,783
現在你跟壞人一夥了
You with the bad boys now, baby.

838
01:02:07,825 --> 01:02:09,785
走吧
Let's go.

839
01:02:19,921 --> 01:02:21,839
你認為怎麼樣？
What do you think?

840
01:02:21,923 --> 01:02:25,509
我想葛蘭很驚奇，我們有了另一個兄弟
l think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got ourselves another partner.

841
01:02:26,844 --> 01:02:30,180
想加入
Hey, Studs, how ya doin'?

842
01:02:30,264 --> 01:02:33,267
你們在這幹嘛?
Jesus Christ, what are you guys doin' here?

843
01:02:33,351 --> 01:02:36,145
你在等我們嗎?
Weren't you expecting us?

844
01:02:38,106 --> 01:02:40,066
終於有人踩了你的墨鏡
Where's your sunglasses? Somebody finally step on 'em for ya?

845
01:02:40,149 --> 01:02:42,985
- 我不知道 - 你的襯衫上是誰的血?
- I don't know. - Whose blood you got on your shirt?

846
01:02:43,027 --> 01:02:46,280
那些傢伙瘋了
Listen, man, these guys are crazy.

847
01:02:46,364 --> 01:02:48,657
史努比 那些傢伙瘋了
- Snoop! - Shit.

848
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:51,077
我們有麻煩？
We have a problem here?

849
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:54,079
傑克弗理，有名的銀行大盜
Jack Foley, famous bank robber.

850
01:02:54,163 --> 01:02:56,915
史努比米勒，有名的拳手經紀人
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.

851
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,961
報上說你從佛羅里達逃獄
Seems l read somewhere that you broke out of a prison down in Florida.

852
01:03:00,044 --> 01:03:02,254
- 是那樣的？ - 那裡全是低級的人，史努比
- ls that right? - They got a low class of people there, Snoop.

853
01:03:02,338 --> 01:03:04,757
再叫一次，你頭會撞壁
Hey, you call him that again I'm gonna put your head through the wall.

854
01:03:06,718 --> 01:03:09,178
什麼? 你說「史努比?」
What? You mean ''Snoop''?

855
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:14,725
白波是說沒人叫我史努比了
Nobody calls me Snoop or Snoopy anymore is what White Boy Bob is trying to tell you.

856
01:03:14,809 --> 01:03:17,186
他只是有點粗魯。你懂嘛?
He's just a little crude with it. You know what l mean?

857
01:03:17,228 --> 01:03:19,480
我全拋腦後了，夥伴
Nah, l left all that behind me, partner.

858
01:03:19,564 --> 01:03:21,482
你叫這白癡「白波?」
But you call this bozo ''White Boy.''

859
01:03:21,566 --> 01:03:24,694
白波曾是個拳手
White Boy Bob used to be a fighter.

860
01:03:24,736 --> 01:03:27,572
你現在做甚麼，白波?
Oh, so tell me, what do you do now, White Boy Bob,

861
01:03:27,655 --> 01:03:29,573
除了射掉你的大嘴巴?
outside of shoot your big mouth off?

862
01:03:32,577 --> 01:03:35,288
- 像在監獄大院一樣 - 就這樣
- Like being back in the yard, isn't it? - Yeah, just like it.

863
01:03:35,372 --> 01:03:37,374
不准退出
Nobody backing down or nothing.

864
01:03:37,415 --> 01:03:40,751
誰要退出，誰就是膽小鬼
You back down, you just a pussy.

865
01:03:40,835 --> 01:03:44,463
- 為什麼你們全在底特律? - 葛蘭沒告訴你?
- Why y'all in Detroit anyway, up here in the cold? - Glenn didn't tell you?

866
01:03:44,547 --> 01:03:48,342
- 葛蘭?什麼? - 我以為你們被抓了
- Glenn? What? - l thought you guys were busted.

867
01:03:48,426 --> 01:03:51,429
為什麼?因為你留我們站在路旁
Why's that? 'Cause you left us standing on the side of the road?

868
01:03:51,513 --> 01:03:53,640
噢
Whoops.

869
01:03:55,934 --> 01:03:58,686
聽著，我不知道葛蘭答應了什麼
Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you,

870
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:01,439
現在計劃是
or what you think you're going to get out of this-- here's the deal:

871
01:04:01,481 --> 01:04:04,442
從瑞利那裡得到的錢我和巴蒂拿一半
Buddy and l, we're going to take half of anything we get off of Ripley.

872
01:04:04,526 --> 01:04:06,528
其他的，你們去分
Anything else, you guys are allowed to cut up any way you want.

873
01:04:06,611 --> 01:04:09,488
為什麼不到外面談?
Oh. Why don't we talk about this outside, man?

874
01:04:11,074 --> 01:04:15,286
- 這裡舒服。很溫暖 - 這裡大概90度
- Nice in here. It's warm. - Warm? It's like 90 degrees in here, man.

875
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:17,580
有時有100度以上
Sometimes it's 100 up in this mug.

876
01:04:17,622 --> 01:04:19,749
因為伊曼喜歡保持這樣
That's the way Emmanuel like to keep it.

877
01:04:19,791 --> 01:04:22,168
把他的拳手養得瘦瘦兇兇的像湯米賀恩一樣
Keep his fighters mean and lean like Tommy Hearns. Ain't that right, Kenny?

878
01:04:22,252 --> 01:04:24,420
我要去個地方
l got someplace to be anyway, so tell you what:

879
01:04:24,463 --> 01:04:26,423
星期五晚上來看比賽
Why don't y'all come by the fights Friday night?

880
01:04:26,465 --> 01:04:28,967
我們坐下來，慢慢談。討論一下計劃
We'll sit down, chop it up, you know, look it over.

881
01:04:29,051 --> 01:04:32,179
- 州立劇院 - 到時見
- State Theater. - All right. We'll see you then.

882
01:04:41,647 --> 01:04:46,068
拿槍打劫銀行一定要很大的勇氣
So it must take a lot of balls to walk into a bank and stick it up with a gun, huh?

883
01:04:46,151 --> 01:04:48,736
我不知道。我從沒用過槍
I don't know. l never used a gun before in my life.

884
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:50,738
你開玩笑
You're kidding.

885
01:04:50,822 --> 01:04:54,075
如果你做得巧妙，你會得到意想不到的東西
You'd be surprised what all you can get if you ask for it the right way.

886
01:04:54,159 --> 01:04:58,329
就因為你，我不敢把錢存在銀行
Well, you're the reason, my friend, that I don't keep all my money in the bank.

887
01:04:58,372 --> 01:05:00,665
那你放在哪裡?
So where do you keep your money, Dick?

888
01:05:00,749 --> 01:05:02,667
我是說那些沒加工過的鑽石
Talking about all those uncut diamonds you told about.

889
01:05:02,751 --> 01:05:06,004
- 我知道你在說什麼 - 你有膽量
- l know what you're talking about. - You're the one with balls.

890
01:05:06,046 --> 01:05:08,089
跟葛蘭說過嗎?
Say something like that to somebody like Glenn?

891
01:05:08,173 --> 01:05:10,925
得了，誰會相信葛蘭
Glenn? Come on, nobody's going to believe Glenn.

892
01:05:11,009 --> 01:05:13,469
- 你相信他嗎? - 我不
- Do you believe Glenn? - Uh, no, I don't.

893
01:05:13,512 --> 01:05:16,515
就算是真的，他也要知道我藏在哪裡
Besides, even if it was true, he'd still have to know where l keep 'em, wouldn't he?

894
01:05:16,598 --> 01:05:19,392
你跟他說藏在你家
Doesn't have to know anything. You told him you keep 'em in your house.

895
01:05:19,476 --> 01:05:23,271
我家很大。你要在這兒待多久?
It's a very big house. So, how much longer you in here for?

896
01:05:23,355 --> 01:05:28,151
22個月，三天，兩個鐘頭
Uh, 22 months, three days, two hours.

897
01:05:28,193 --> 01:05:32,071
- 為什麼? - 因為我可以雇像你這樣的人
- Why? - 'Cause l could use a guy like you.

898
01:05:32,156 --> 01:05:35,325
一個知道怎麼才能做得巧妙的人
Somebody that knows how to ask for things in the right way.

899
01:05:35,367 --> 01:05:37,327
我是說在你出獄後
I'm talking about when you're out of here.

900
01:05:37,369 --> 01:05:39,829
你不可能老打劫銀行，對不對?
After all, you can't rob banks forever, can you?

901
01:05:39,872 --> 01:05:42,875
- 我可不是一個上班族 - 誰是?
- I'm not exactly a nine to five type. - Who is?

902
01:05:53,052 --> 01:05:54,970
我以為人人都喜歡艾迪
l thought everybody liked Eddie.

903
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:00,975
- 你好嗎，雷? - 我冷死了
- How you doin', Ray? - I'm freezing.

904
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:03,479
我可是開始暖和起來了
But I'm getting warmer.

905
01:06:03,562 --> 01:06:07,732
除了上次我們合作很愉快以外
So listen, other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together,

906
01:06:07,817 --> 01:06:10,236
為什麼找我，不找聯邦調查局
you want to tell me why you're coming to me instead of the F.B.l.?

907
01:06:10,277 --> 01:06:13,113
調查局只會叫我去買咖啡
l go to the F.B.l., the first thing they're gonna do is send me to get some coffee.

908
01:06:13,197 --> 01:06:15,115
你知道嗎?你是對的
You know what? You're right.

909
01:06:15,199 --> 01:06:18,660
去年緝毒局想要抓葛蘭說他持有毒品
Ray, about a year ago, D.E.A. had a guy, Glenn Michaels, on possession with intent.

910
01:06:18,744 --> 01:06:22,122
- 但沒有成功 - 開車
- Listen, is that your car? Find out whose it is. - They couldn't make it stick.

911
01:06:22,206 --> 01:06:25,209
葛蘭說他要來底特律看朋友
ln his statement, he said he was coming to Detroit to see a friend...

912
01:06:25,251 --> 01:06:27,253
談有關工作的事
about job opportunities, if you can believe that.

913
01:06:27,336 --> 01:06:29,421
- 什麼朋友 - 莫瑞米勒，
- What was the name of the friend? - Maurice Miller,

914
01:06:29,505 --> 01:06:32,508
渾名叫史努比，以前是拳手
also known as Snoopy, used to be a prizefighter.

915
01:06:32,592 --> 01:06:35,177
我知道史努比，這人很難搞
l know Snoopy. He's a fucking wack job.

916
01:06:35,261 --> 01:06:37,596
在西部
He thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard, hangs out over on the west side...

917
01:06:37,638 --> 01:06:40,432
和另外幾個頭號笨蛋一起
with a couple of other first-rate nut cases.

918
01:06:40,516 --> 01:06:42,768
- 我要地址 - 27-10
- Well, I'm gonna need a last known address. - 2710 coming in.

919
01:06:42,852 --> 01:06:45,479
- 你要什麼? - 最近的地址
- You're gonna need what? - A last known address.

920
01:06:46,564 --> 01:06:49,358
那是你的車嗎?
That your car?

921
01:06:49,442 --> 01:06:52,445
我不喜歡你和米勒單獨見面
No way. I don't want you talking to Miller alone.

922
01:06:52,487 --> 01:06:56,699
得了，雷，我是聯邦人員，我有槍
Come on, Ray. I'm a federal officer. l can handle myself. I'm armed.

923
01:06:59,035 --> 01:07:00,995
明天我再打電話告訴你地址
l'll call you tomorrow with the address.

924
01:07:03,539 --> 01:07:05,457
謝謝你，雷
Thank you, Raymond.

925
01:07:05,541 --> 01:07:07,960
你看報紙了嗎?
You see the paper?

926
01:07:08,002 --> 01:07:10,295
- 她很上鏡頭 - 除了這
- It's a terrific shot of her. - Outside of that.

927
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:13,800
我不認為她來此跟我們有關係
Doesn't say what she's doing here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.

928
01:07:13,883 --> 01:07:16,427
她是來渡假，因為這裡狗屎天氣
She came up here on her vacation because she likes shitty weather.

929
01:07:16,469 --> 01:07:18,429
我想她是來抓葛蘭的
Nah, l think she's after Glenn.

930
01:07:18,471 --> 01:07:20,598
那女的在嗎
The girl still there?

931
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:23,809
除非你給錢，否則她們不會留下過夜
They don't stay the whole night, Jack, unless you pay for it.

932
01:07:23,893 --> 01:07:28,564
- 你有沒有告訴你姐姐?  - 有，我剛打了。她為我祈禱
- Did you tell your sister? - Yeah, l just hung up. She prayed for me.

933
01:07:28,648 --> 01:07:31,984
- 你打了多久? - 兩個小時
- Mm-hmm. And how long were you on the phone with her? - Two hours.

934
01:07:32,068 --> 01:07:35,821
- 你跟那女的呢? - 四十五分鐘
- And how long were you with the girl? - 45 minutes.

935
01:07:35,905 --> 01:07:37,823
你跟你姐姐談到瑞利了嗎?
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?

936
01:07:37,907 --> 01:07:40,326
別再提我姐姐了
Look, Jack, just forget about my sister, okay?

937
01:07:40,368 --> 01:07:43,287
如果凱倫盯著葛蘭，我們就慘了
Now, if Karen Sisco is tailing Glenn, we're fucked.

938
01:07:43,329 --> 01:07:45,414
明晚我們都會被抓
Tomorrow night at the fights, we all get picked up.

939
01:07:45,498 --> 01:07:49,043
我們先去劇院，看看
Why don't we just drive by where we're meeting tonight, check it out.

940
01:07:49,127 --> 01:07:51,045
再去瑞利家
And we'll go by Ripley's too, while we're at it.

941
01:07:51,129 --> 01:07:53,464
好吧
- Yeah, all right. - All right.

942
01:08:02,015 --> 01:08:05,685
- 安瑟旅館，我能否為你服務? - 請找凱倫西思柯
- Athenaeum Hotel, how may l help you? - Karen Sisco, please.

943
01:08:06,853 --> 01:08:09,105
- 好西部旅館 - 請找凱倫西思柯
- Hello, Best Western. - Karen Sisco, please.

944
01:08:13,318 --> 01:08:16,696
- 莫塞米勒嗎? - 你找誰?
- Moselle Miller? - What do you want?

945
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:20,867
- 我找莫瑞 - 你找到他，說他那隻狗死了
- I'm looking for Maurice. - You find him, tell him the dog got run over.

946
01:08:20,951 --> 01:08:22,911
我沒有伙食錢了
I'm out of grocery money.

947
01:08:22,994 --> 01:08:26,247
- 你在和誰說話? - 有個女的找莫瑞
- Moselle, who you talkin' to? - Lady lookin' for Maurice.

948
01:08:26,331 --> 01:08:28,374
- 她要什麼 - 她沒說
- What does she want? - Hasn't said.

949
01:08:28,458 --> 01:08:31,919
- 那不是莫瑞? - 那是我弟弟肯尼
- That's not Maurice? - That's Kenneth, my brother. He's talkin' on the phone.

950
01:08:32,003 --> 01:08:34,714
- 問她找他幹什麼 - 你去問她!
- Ask her what she want with him! - You ask her!

951
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:37,842
- 莫瑞的事與我無關 - 你媽的對
- Maurice business is none of my business. - Yeah, you damn right.

952
01:08:39,553 --> 01:08:41,763
劇場? 誰在比賽?
State Theater, huh? Who's fightin'?

953
01:08:43,056 --> 01:08:45,767
黑鬼，怎麼樣?
Nigger, what?

954
01:08:48,395 --> 01:08:51,106
我在找一個莫瑞認識的人
I'm looking for somebody l think Maurice knows.

955
01:08:52,899 --> 01:08:55,067
你不是緩刑小組來的吧?
You're not with probation, one of those?

956
01:08:55,152 --> 01:08:58,405
- 不是 - 你是律師嗎?
- No. - You a lawyer?

957
01:08:58,447 --> 01:09:01,575
不是。我在找葛蘭麥克
No, I'm not. I'm looking for somebody named Glenn Michaels.

958
01:09:03,243 --> 01:09:06,537
我不認識什麼葛蘭
Glenn? I don't know any Glenn.

959
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:08,582
他說他去年11月待在這裡
He said he stayed here last November.

960
01:09:08,665 --> 01:09:11,417
- 在這房子裡? - 他說他和莫瑞在一塊
- Here in this house? - He said he stayed with Maurice.

961
01:09:11,501 --> 01:09:15,087
連莫瑞都不常來了
Well, he ain't even here that much.

962
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:17,006
我想知道他到那去了
l'd like to know where he goes, but at the same time,

963
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:19,926
又不想知道，你懂嗎?
I don't wanna know, you understand?

964
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:22,929
我懂
Yeah.

965
01:09:23,013 --> 01:09:26,683
- 你的狗死了? - 被車碾死的了
- You say your dog was killed? - Got run over by a car.

966
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:31,939
- 它叫什麼? - 它是母的，叫塔菲
- What'd you call him? - Was a she. Named Tuffy.

967
01:09:34,274 --> 01:09:36,943
你想我在那裡可以找到莫瑞?
Where do you think l might find Maurice, Moselle?

968
01:09:37,027 --> 01:09:39,946
我不知道。健身房?拳擊場?
I don't know. The gym, the fights.

969
01:09:39,988 --> 01:09:44,117
他從不錯過拳賽。明天晚上劇場裡有拳賽
l know he don't miss the fights. They're havin' some tomorrow down at the State Theater.

970
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:46,494
- 他以前都帶我去 - 劇場
- He used to take me. - The State Theater.

971
01:09:46,578 --> 01:09:48,830
你為什麼問一大堆有關莫瑞的事?
Why you askin' all these questions about Maurice?

972
01:09:48,914 --> 01:09:50,916
她在找一個叫葛蘭的人
She lookin' for a man name of Glenn.

973
01:09:50,958 --> 01:09:54,127
我問你了嗎?辦你的事去
Did l ask you? Go on and do something with yourself, Moselle.

974
01:09:54,211 --> 01:09:58,173
你去給我們拿點吃的來
Why don't you take your ass to Dot and Etta's and get us some shrimp or somethin'?

975
01:10:09,074 --> 01:10:10,274
你打拳
You are a fight?

976
01:10:10,275 --> 01:10:11,275
你怎麼知道？
How do you know that?

977
01:10:11,476 --> 01:10:12,476
我看得出來
I can't tell.

978
01:10:12,877 --> 01:10:14,477
我是
Yeah, I was.

979
01:10:16,025 --> 01:10:18,444
直到我的視網膜剝落了二次
'Til l got my retina detached two times.

980
01:10:20,113 --> 01:10:24,075
- 你打那一級?中量級? - 輕量級
- What'd you fight, about middleweight? - Nah, light.

981
01:10:24,117 --> 01:10:27,161
超中量級，等我長壯一點
Super middleweight, once my body developed.

982
01:10:28,496 --> 01:10:32,208
- 你打那一級?羽量級? - 蠅量級
- What you go about, what, a bantam? - Flyweight.

983
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:36,796
黑鬼，怎樣?該知道你的等級
Nigger, what? You know your divisions, huh?

984
01:10:36,838 --> 01:10:40,132
你喜歡打拳嗎?你喜歡動粗嗎?
Do you like the fights? You like the rough stuff?

985
01:10:40,216 --> 01:10:43,010
我想你一定喜歡
Yeah, l bet you do.

986
01:10:43,094 --> 01:10:45,471
想不想下來幹一場?
You like to get down and tussle a little bit?

987
01:10:45,555 --> 01:10:48,808
像從前我和塔菲一樣
Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over.

988
01:10:48,892 --> 01:10:51,185
我們常在地上扭在一塊
We used to get down on the floor and tussle all the time.

989
01:10:51,269 --> 01:10:57,108
我告訴它「塔菲」，你這只好狗這個好吃的給你」
l'd say to her, ''You a good bitch, Tuffy. Here's a treat for ya.''

990
01:10:57,150 --> 01:11:01,821
我給塔菲所有母狗都愛的，你知道是什麼嗎?
And l give Tuffy what all good bitches love best, and you know what that is?

991
01:11:02,989 --> 01:11:07,493
知道那是什麼嗎?一塊骨頭
Know what that is? A bone.

992
01:11:07,577 --> 01:11:09,829
我也會給你一塊好的骨頭
l'll give you a good bone too, girl.

993
01:11:09,871 --> 01:11:11,831
你不是我喜歡的那種人
You're not my type.

994
01:11:11,915 --> 01:11:14,584
那話對我沒意義
No, that shit don't mean nothin' to me.

995
01:11:14,668 --> 01:11:18,296
- 我掏出我的大傢伙…… - 我得走了
- l let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants. - l gotta go, Kenneth.

996
01:11:18,338 --> 01:11:20,673
- 說不定我們會再見面 - 不，我們先幹一場
- Maybe we'll see each other again. - No, no, we gonna tussle first.

997
01:11:22,092 --> 01:11:24,260
Awww!
Awww!

998
01:11:24,344 --> 01:11:27,180
媽的!那是什麼鬼東西?
Damn it! What the fuck was that?

999
01:11:27,264 --> 01:11:30,850
你想幹一場。我們來干
You wanted to tussle. We tussled.

1000
01:11:32,144 --> 01:11:36,189
那是個大房子
That's a big ass house.

1001
01:11:36,273 --> 01:11:38,191
這地方就像監獄
Place almost looks like a prison.

1002
01:11:38,275 --> 01:11:40,568
他可真有一套，複雜的保安系統
No doubt he's got some serious security system.

1003
01:11:40,652 --> 01:11:43,738
到時候，我們去敲門看他要不要敘舊
Time comes, we go up, knock on the door, see if he wants to talk about old times.

1004
01:11:43,822 --> 01:11:46,533
- 太簡單了 - 酷
- You know, the easy way. - Cool.

1005
01:11:46,616 --> 01:11:50,369
有史努比和那一身肉的混蛋他會讓我們進去嗎?
Think he'll let us in, we got the Snoop and that musclebound asshole with us?

1006
01:11:50,454 --> 01:11:52,372
沒有別人
Nobody's gonna be with us.

1007
01:11:52,456 --> 01:11:55,167
明晚我們去看拳賽聽聽史努比的大計劃
l say we go to the fights tomorrow night, see what Snoopy's big plan is,

1008
01:11:55,208 --> 01:11:58,628
然後我們比他快一步
then we go in, ahead of him, alone.

1009
01:11:58,712 --> 01:12:00,630
好主意
Oh, l can dig it.

1010
01:12:00,714 --> 01:12:03,425
當我們去逍遙的時候讓葛蘭去應付史努
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we off livin' the good life.

1011
01:12:03,508 --> 01:12:06,010
你知道有誰做了一大筆
Good life. Buddy, you know anybody who's done one last big score...

1012
01:12:06,053 --> 01:12:08,013
然後就逍遙法外了?
and then gone on to live the good life?

1013
01:12:08,055 --> 01:12:11,224
我們也有可能空手而歸
Look, Jack, there's a chance we'll walk out of here with nothin'.

1014
01:12:11,266 --> 01:12:13,268
我看，聽天由命吧
l say, let fate decide.

1015
01:12:13,352 --> 01:12:16,188
命運?你是什麼，他媽的達賴喇嘛?
Let fate decide? What are you, the fuckin' Dalai Lama now?

1016
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:18,190
是我姊姊
Nah, man, it's my sister.

1017
01:12:18,232 --> 01:12:20,442
我姊姊相信命運不相信地獄
My sister believes in fate but not hell.

1018
01:12:20,526 --> 01:12:22,569
她不再為喪失靈魂的人禱告
That's why she stopped praying for all the lost souls,

1019
01:12:22,653 --> 01:12:24,821
雖然你不肯再聽贖罪之類的話
since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore.

1020
01:12:24,905 --> 01:12:28,241
但她每天仍為巴蒂禱告希望他不出事
But every day, she asks her boss to pray that Buddy don't fuck up.

1021
01:12:28,325 --> 01:12:30,910
你認為呢?
l mean, what do you think?

1022
01:12:30,994 --> 01:12:33,454
你認為地獄存在嗎?
- Well-- - You think there's a hell?

1023
01:12:33,539 --> 01:12:36,416
葛雷茲監獄就是
Yeah, it's called the Glades Correctional lnstitute.

1024
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:38,877
我決不回到像那樣的地方去
I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.

1025
01:12:38,919 --> 01:12:41,254
他們用槍對著你，你就得去
They put a gun on you, you'll go, brother.

1026
01:12:42,965 --> 01:12:45,968
那怕有槍，你還是有選擇的餘地
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice.

1027
01:12:48,345 --> 01:12:52,349
所以，弗理先生
So, Mr. Foley,

1028
01:12:52,433 --> 01:12:56,979
瑞利先生和我長談過你在公司上班的事
Mr. Ripley and l have had a long discussion about your role in the company,

1029
01:12:57,062 --> 01:12:59,647
他覺得你在邁阿密上班會愉快些
and it was his feeling you'd be happiest working down here in Miami.

1030
01:12:59,732 --> 01:13:02,317
- 怎麼樣？ - 好極了
- How's that sound to you? - Sounds great.

1031
01:13:02,401 --> 01:13:05,654
好。你穿42號加長的，對嗎?
Good. You're about a 42 long, right?

1032
01:13:08,073 --> 01:13:11,868
我大概是穿42號
l uh, I'm about a 42--

1033
01:13:11,952 --> 01:13:13,870
像，42號普通的
like, 42 regular.

1034
01:13:21,879 --> 01:13:24,089
- 穿穿看合不合身 - 這是什麼?
- Okay, let's see how she fits. - What is that?

1035
01:13:24,131 --> 01:13:26,091
你的制服
Your uniform.

1036
01:13:28,302 --> 01:13:30,220
我的制服?
My uniform.

1037
01:13:31,597 --> 01:13:33,599
弗理先生 弗理先生
Mr. Foley. Mr. Foley!

1038
01:13:34,767 --> 01:13:36,935
先生! 請等等
Sir, sir. Excuse me, sir.

1039
01:13:36,977 --> 01:13:39,354
先生! 請等等
Sir! Sir, excuse me!

1040
01:13:39,438 --> 01:13:41,481
- 你不能進去! - 有警衛？
- You can't go in there! - Are you fucking kidding me? A security guard?

1041
01:13:41,565 --> 01:13:44,150
- 你搞什麼，昏了頭啦? - 嘿，別發火!
- What are you, stoned? - Hey, hey! Take it easy!

1042
01:13:44,235 --> 01:13:46,153
沒關係，佩姬。沒事了
It's all right, Peggy. It's under control.

1043
01:13:48,614 --> 01:13:50,824
聽我說
You know something?

1044
01:13:50,908 --> 01:13:53,869
我不確定你會來。但我知道如果你來了
l wasn't sure that you'd show up here, but l was very sure if you did,

1045
01:13:53,953 --> 01:13:56,580
你也會把這差事扔到我臉上
you'd throw this job in my face.

1046
01:13:56,664 --> 01:13:58,582
讓我告訴你吧
Let me tell you something.

1047
01:13:58,666 --> 01:14:02,127
到今天為止你所做的
Every single thing you've done with your life up until this point...

1048
01:14:02,169 --> 01:14:04,629
都沒有任何意義
in the real world means nothing.

1049
01:14:04,672 --> 01:14:06,632
一點意義也沒有
Less than nothing.

1050
01:14:06,674 --> 01:14:08,759
你是個搶銀行的
You're a bank robber.

1051
01:14:08,843 --> 01:14:11,554
那是個見不得人的本事
That's not a very marketable skill.

1052
01:14:11,637 --> 01:14:14,348
誰看過搶銀行的
We don't see a lot of old bank robbers walking around...

1053
01:14:14,432 --> 01:14:17,351
領養老金了?
with a pension plan, now do we?

1054
01:14:17,435 --> 01:14:19,395
我想你懂這個道理所以你才會來這裡
l think you know this. That's why you're here.

1055
01:14:19,479 --> 01:14:22,190
今天，我給你……
Today, l've offered you...

1056
01:14:22,273 --> 01:14:25,526
一個爛工作，爛薪水
a lousy job with a lousy wage.

1057
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:29,697
你要好一點的工作?證明你能改頭換面給我看
You want something better? Why don't you show me you can change?

1058
01:14:29,781 --> 01:14:32,992
我才會給你好點的差事
Then l'll offer you something better, a lot better.

1059
01:14:33,034 --> 01:14:36,537
在這之前，老兄，你得去賺
But until then, my friend, you'll have to earn it.

1060
01:14:37,955 --> 01:14:39,873
怎麼賺，狄克?像你這樣?
How, Dick? The way you earn it?

1061
01:14:41,042 --> 01:14:43,044
討個開公司的富婆
Married some rich broad owns the company,

1062
01:14:43,127 --> 01:14:45,170
賣了公司，再和她離婚?
selling it off a piece at a time then divorcing her?

1063
01:14:45,213 --> 01:14:49,634
說什麼「自食其力」的狗屎?
What's this Knute Rockne ''pull yourself up by the bootstraps'' bullshit?

1064
01:14:49,717 --> 01:14:52,886
在監獄裡，像你這種人?
Back in prison, a guy like you in a place like that?

1065
01:14:52,971 --> 01:14:56,265
一定會被整得稀巴爛
You were ice cream for freaks. A goddamned dumpling.

1066
01:14:56,349 --> 01:14:59,852
莫瑞和其他的傢伙會要你的命
Maurice and a dozen other guys would have bled you till you had nothing.

1067
01:14:59,894 --> 01:15:03,063
打死你。是我救了你的狗命
Until you were nothing. l saved your ass!

1068
01:15:03,147 --> 01:15:05,649
抱歉我不願坐椅子上
So you'll pardon me if I don't want to sit on a fucking stool all day,

1069
01:15:05,733 --> 01:15:08,902
還要說「請簽名」或「你不能停在這裡」
and say, ''Sign in here, please,'' or ''Hey, pal, you can't park here.''

1070
01:15:08,987 --> 01:15:12,156
我不能幹這種事，狄克
All right, Dick? I can't fuckin' do it, Dick!

1071
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,200
你讓我失望
- I'm disappointed in you. - You wanna--

1072
01:15:14,242 --> 01:15:16,827
又來了。他答應了你們這些人什麼?
Oh, here we go. What job did he promise you boys?

1073
01:15:16,911 --> 01:15:19,455
- 我們有二種辦法 - 什麼辦法?
- There's two ways we can do this. - Yeah, what are they?

1074
01:15:41,973 --> 01:15:44,168
山托斯銀行

1075
01:16:04,042 --> 01:16:08,171
我必需買雙好鞋以及明天用的東西
Hey, Buddy, l gotta get a better pair of shoes and some things for tomorrow.

1076
01:16:08,255 --> 01:16:10,173
我們一會兒見
Drop me off by the Ren Center and we'll hook up later?

1077
01:16:10,257 --> 01:16:13,134
好
Yeah, okay.

1078
01:16:13,176 --> 01:16:14,594
我最好打個電話給我姊姊
l better go call my sister.

1079
01:16:30,569 --> 01:16:33,154
要喝點什麼？
Can l get you anything?

1080
01:16:33,238 --> 01:16:35,615
我要波本和水
Yeah, l'll have a bourbon, please. Water back.

1081
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:37,617
好
Okay.

1082
01:16:40,037 --> 01:16:43,165
你為什麼不問我們還要什麼?
Hey, Tad, why don't you do us again, please?

1083
01:16:43,248 --> 01:16:46,459
席萊，那女士的酒算我們的
Oh, and, Celeste, put the lady's drink on our bill.

1084
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,932
- 他們要請你喝杯酒 - 我想也是
- They want to buy your drink for you. - Yeah, l get that.

1085
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:03,351
- 告訴他們我情願自己付 - 好的
- Tell them l'd rather pay for my own. - Okay.

1086
01:17:08,148 --> 01:17:10,066
我來問問看
l'll find out.

1087
01:17:13,696 --> 01:17:15,698
對不起
Excuse me.

1088
01:17:15,781 --> 01:17:18,241
我和同事們打了個賭
My associates and l, we made a little bet...

1089
01:17:18,325 --> 01:17:20,285
看看你是幹哪一行的?
on what you do for a living.

1090
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:23,330
我打贏了。我叫菲利普
And l won. Hi. I'm Phillip.

1091
01:17:23,372 --> 01:17:27,084
菲利普，我只想安靜的喝一杯酒走
lf it's okay with you, Phillip, l'd rather just have a quiet drink and leave.

1092
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:31,045
難道你不想知道我是怎麼知道的?
Don't you want to know what l guessed? How l know what you do for a living?

1093
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:34,258
我並不想對你不禮貌，我只是想清靜一下
Really, Phillip, I don't want to be rude. l just want to be left alone.

1094
01:17:40,848 --> 01:17:43,267
她有點冷淡
It's a little cold over there.

1095
01:17:49,773 --> 01:17:52,275
我知道你為什麼這麼沮喪
Excuse me. l think l know why you're depressed.

1096
01:17:52,359 --> 01:17:55,570
我能把我的意見告訴你嗎?
lf l can offer my observation.

1097
01:17:56,739 --> 01:17:59,908
我猜你是新來的推銷員
See, l got a hunch you're the new sales rep,

1098
01:17:59,992 --> 01:18:05,205
你的客戶並不十分滿意，因為處理他們戶頭的
and the client's not exactly knocked out by the fact that a young lady--

1099
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:09,542
竟然是一位像你這麼年輕的小姐
even one as stunning as yourself-- is handling the account.

1100
01:18:09,585 --> 01:18:12,504
我猜得很對吧?
Am l close?

1101
01:18:12,588 --> 01:18:14,506
我是安迪
I'm Andy.

1102
01:18:16,217 --> 01:18:21,847
我們都是廣告業的，今天早上才從紐約飛來的
We're all ad guys. Flew in this morning from the apple-- New York.

1103
01:18:21,881 --> 01:18:24,675
替「河邊路人」酒廠做廣告
Came in to pitch Hiram Walker Distillery.

1104
01:18:24,717 --> 01:18:27,761
給新的瑪格麗特雞尾酒做試售計劃
Little test market campaign for the new margarita mix.

1105
01:18:27,845 --> 01:18:31,974
那真的是很有意思，比方說
It's really pretty interesting. We take this, um,

1106
01:18:32,058 --> 01:18:34,602
麥克司…西裔的土匪
Mex-- um, Hispanic bandito...

1107
01:18:34,685 --> 01:18:38,230
掛著子彈帶，拿了傢伙戴了一個大帽子
with his bullet belts and everything, and the big Chihuahua hat,

1108
01:18:38,314 --> 01:18:41,108
然後他拔出六發子彈的槍
and he pulls out his six-guns,

1109
01:18:41,192 --> 01:18:44,737
- 我背後的那些傢伙 - 安迪
- and these guys back here-- - Andy.

1110
01:18:44,779 --> 01:18:46,906
誰管這些狗屎?
Really. Who gives a shit?

1111
01:18:46,989 --> 01:18:51,910
- 要不要告訴我怎麼回事兒? - 滾開，安迪
- Do you want to tell me what happened? - Beat it, Andy.

1112
01:19:00,712 --> 01:19:02,630
安迪
Andy.

1113
01:19:02,714 --> 01:19:04,632
你做了什麼?
What'd you do?

1114
01:19:16,603 --> 01:19:20,690
- 我能請你喝杯酒嗎？ - 好，來一杯
- Can l buy you a drink? - Yeah, l'd love one.

1115
01:19:22,775 --> 01:19:25,152
坐下
Sit down.

1116
01:19:37,707 --> 01:19:39,625
我是蓋瑞
I'm Gary.

1117
01:19:41,252 --> 01:19:43,170
我是席萊
I'm Celeste.

1118
01:19:45,632 --> 01:19:48,551
- 只有一個女侍 - 我可以到吧檯去
- lt takes forever to get a drink. There's only one waitress. - l can go to the bar.

1119
01:19:48,635 --> 01:19:50,970
- 別去 - 他們煩你了？
- Oh, don't go. - Are those guys bothering you?

1120
01:19:51,054 --> 01:19:53,014
沒事，你剛到嗎?
No, they're fine. l mean, you just got here.

1121
01:19:57,477 --> 01:19:59,437
來，喝一點
Here, help yourself.

1122
01:20:01,314 --> 01:20:03,858
- 你喜歡波本酒? - 我喜歡
- You like bourbon? - l love it.

1123
01:20:03,942 --> 01:20:07,362
席萊，告訴我，你是幹哪一行的?
We got that out of the way. Tell me, Celeste, what do you do for a living?

1124
01:20:07,445 --> 01:20:11,031
我是個推銷員，來拜訪一位客戶
I'm a sales rep, and l came here to call on a customer,

1125
01:20:11,116 --> 01:20:13,243
因為我是女的，他們就刁難我
but they gave me a hard time 'cause I'm a girl.

1126
01:20:13,326 --> 01:20:15,244
你是這麼想你自己的嗎?
ls that how you think of yourself?

1127
01:20:15,328 --> 01:20:17,246
- 推銷員？ - 女人
- As a sales rep? - As a girl.

1128
01:20:17,330 --> 01:20:19,332
- 我無所謂 - 我喜歡你的髮型
- Yeah, I don't have a problem with it. - l like your hair.

1129
01:20:19,374 --> 01:20:23,336
- 我喜歡你的打扮 - 這是我第二喜歡的一套衣服
- l like your outfit. - Actually, this is my second favorite outfit.

1130
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:26,756
我最喜歡的一套已經被糟蹋了只好扔了
l had a first favorite, but it got ruined and l had to get rid of it.

1131
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,758
- 真的？ - 臭臭的
- You did? - lt smelled.

1132
01:20:28,842 --> 01:20:31,344
- 洗了也沒用 - 對
- Really? Having it cleaned didn't help? - No.

1133
01:20:31,428 --> 01:20:33,346
蓋瑞，你做什麼的?
So tell me, Gary, what do you do for a living?

1134
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:36,433
- 你還要這樣繼續多久? - 先別說甚麼
- How far do you want to go with this? - Don't say anything yet.

1135
01:20:36,516 --> 01:20:38,893
沒用的，我們就是我們
I don't think it works if we're somebody else.

1136
01:20:38,977 --> 01:20:40,895
蓋瑞和席萊，他們知道甚麼?
l mean, Gary and Celeste, what do they know about anything?

1137
01:20:40,979 --> 01:20:43,523
- 我沒玩過這種遊戲 - 這不是遊戲
- Well, this is your game, l've never played before. - It's not a game.

1138
01:20:43,607 --> 01:20:45,775
不是你玩的遊戲
It's not something you play.

1139
01:20:45,859 --> 01:20:47,861
對你有意義嗎?
Well, does this make any sense to you?

1140
01:20:47,903 --> 01:20:50,238
不須要有意義，是自然發生的
lt doesn't have to. It's something that happens.

1141
01:20:50,322 --> 01:20:55,368
像在街上第一次看到一個人，你以為你們會擦肩而過，
It's like seeing someone for the first time-- like you could be passing on the street,

1142
01:20:55,452 --> 01:20:58,705
你們彼此看了幾秒……
and you look at each other and for a few seconds...

1143
01:20:58,789 --> 01:21:02,209
就覺得你們彼此靈犀相通
there's this kind of a recognition-- like you both know something.

1144
01:21:02,292 --> 01:21:05,169
但下一刻，那人就走了
The next moment, the person's gone,

1145
01:21:05,212 --> 01:21:08,632
也來不及做甚麼
and it's too late to do anything about it.

1146
01:21:08,715 --> 01:21:11,551
你會永遠記得，你錯過了某些東西
And you always remember it, because it was there, and you let it go,

1147
01:21:11,593 --> 01:21:14,971
你告訴自己，「假如我停下來了呢?」
and you think to yourself, ''What if l had stopped? lf l had said something?''

1148
01:21:15,055 --> 01:21:16,973
「假如……」
''What if?''

1149
01:21:17,057 --> 01:21:19,017
「假如……」
''What if?''

1150
01:21:19,059 --> 01:21:23,146
這種事一生中只會發生幾次
And it may only happen a few times in your life.

1151
01:21:25,399 --> 01:21:28,777
- 或一次 - 或一次
- Or once. - Or once.

1152
01:22:04,939 --> 01:22:07,483
你怎麼找到我的?
How'd you find me?

1153
01:22:07,566 --> 01:22:09,484
啊恩
Uh--

1154
01:22:11,278 --> 01:22:13,571
我在樓下打到你的房間
Called your room from downstairs.

1155
01:22:13,614 --> 01:22:16,074
哦
Oh.

1156
01:22:17,410 --> 01:22:19,412
如果我接電話，你要說甚麼?
And if l had answered, what were you gonna say?

1157
01:22:19,453 --> 01:22:23,832
說我是誰，你記得我嗎?要不要一起喝一杯？
l would say who l was, and do you remember me, and want to meet for a drink?

1158
01:22:23,916 --> 01:22:28,837
記得你嗎？我來這兒就為找你
lf l remembered you. l came here looking for you.

1159
01:22:28,921 --> 01:22:31,673
然後我會說好。但你知道
All right, so then l would have said yes, but for all you know,

1160
01:22:31,757 --> 01:22:34,176
我也可能讓霹靂小組等著你，你為什麼信任我?
l could have had a SWAT team waiting for you-- why would you trust me?

1161
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:36,262
值得冒險
lt'd be worth the risk.

1162
01:22:36,304 --> 01:22:38,848
- 你喜歡冒險 - 你也是
- You like taking risks. - So do you.

1163
01:22:41,142 --> 01:22:43,477
遲早……
You know, sooner or later--

1164
01:22:47,064 --> 01:22:50,400
你真的穿那套套裝
You really wear that suit.

1165
01:22:50,484 --> 01:22:53,028
這不是你想說的
Well, that's not what you were about to say.

1166
01:22:53,112 --> 01:22:55,989
你記得你在後車廂裡多愛講話?
- Remember how talkative you were in the trunk? - Mm-hmm.

1167
01:22:56,073 --> 01:22:58,950
- 阿黛兒說你一緊張就愛講話 - 她這麼說嗎?
- Adele said you do that when you're nervous. - Oh, she did, did she?

1168
01:23:00,495 --> 01:23:04,582
-你一直摸我的大腿 -但我沒惡意
-You kept touching me, feeling my thigh. -But in a nice way.

1169
01:23:23,851 --> 01:23:26,895
你拿走的西格槍有特殊意義
You know, that Sig you took from me was special.

1170
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:28,940
是我爸送我的生日禮物
My dad gave it to me for my birthday.

1171
01:23:29,023 --> 01:23:30,899
是嗎?
Yeah?

1172
01:23:30,984 --> 01:23:33,069
你要把我怎麼辦?
What were you going to do with me?

1173
01:23:33,152 --> 01:23:35,696
我還沒想出來
l hadn't really worked that part out yet.

1174
01:23:35,738 --> 01:23:37,948
我只知道我喜歡你，不想……
All l knew is that l liked you, and that l didn't wanna...

1175
01:23:38,032 --> 01:23:40,200
離開你就再也見不到你了
leave you there on the side of the road and never see you again.

1176
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:43,830
你在電梯裡招手
Then you waved to me in that elevator.

1177
01:23:43,872 --> 01:23:46,791
我以為你沒看到我
Yeah, l wasn't sure if you caught that.

1178
01:23:46,875 --> 01:23:49,878
我無法相信，我一直…
l couldn't believe it. By that time l had been...

1179
01:23:49,961 --> 01:23:52,213
很想你
thinking about you a lot...

1180
01:23:52,255 --> 01:23:55,716
而且一直想如果我們再見面
and just wondering what it would be like if we met,

1181
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:58,844
如果我們能讓時間停止
if we could take a time-out.

1182
01:23:58,887 --> 01:24:01,264
我也這麼想
l was thinking the same thing.

1183
01:24:01,347 --> 01:24:04,224
如果我們能讓時間停止
l kept thinking, ''What if we took a time-out?''

1184
01:24:04,267 --> 01:24:08,145
如果我們能在一起一段時間
lf we... just spent some time together.

1185
01:24:12,984 --> 01:24:14,902
- 我在街上看到過你 - 哪裡？
- You know, l saw you on the street. - Where?

1186
01:24:14,986 --> 01:24:17,488
阿黛兒家外面
Outside Adele's.

1187
01:24:17,572 --> 01:24:20,408
- 你去看她? - 去警告她要小心奇諾
- You went to see her? - To warn her about Chino.

1188
01:24:20,492 --> 01:24:23,745
- 她幫了你? - 我們不該談這些
- So she did help you. - I don't think we should get into that.

1189
01:24:23,787 --> 01:24:25,872
對，我也不會問巴蒂的事
You're right. And l won't ask about Buddy,

1190
01:24:25,914 --> 01:24:31,461
或你是否見到了葛蘭
or what you guys are doing in Detroit, or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet--

1191
01:24:31,544 --> 01:24:34,380
別這麼說，你讓我害怕
Okay, now, don't talk like that, because you scare me.

1192
01:24:46,059 --> 01:24:49,020
我們走吧
- Let's get out of here. - Yeah.

1193
01:25:43,367 --> 01:25:45,994
有些事情我要你知道
There's something l want you to know.

1194
01:25:46,078 --> 01:25:48,330
我並不是在找樂子，如果你是這麼想的話
l wasn't just looking for a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.

1195
01:25:48,414 --> 01:25:51,041
怎麼了?
- Or, l was-- - Why are you mad?

1196
01:25:51,125 --> 01:25:54,711
我不是在尋刺激，和一個搶銀行的
l was looking for some kinky thrill-- you know, score with the bank robber.

1197
01:25:54,795 --> 01:25:57,547
-像有些女人喜歡粗暴的…… -對
-The way some women go for rough trade-- -All right.

1198
01:25:57,631 --> 01:26:01,635
我不會說我幹了一個聯邦女警，你想我會嗎?
Now l can say that l fucked a U.S. marshal. Do you think l will?

1199
01:26:01,677 --> 01:26:03,929
我不知道
I don't know.

1200
01:26:04,013 --> 01:26:05,931
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

1201
01:26:07,516 --> 01:26:09,476
過來
Come here.

1202
01:26:21,864 --> 01:26:24,324
我認識一個傢伙……
l know a guy...

1203
01:26:24,366 --> 01:26:27,494
帶了個瓶子進了銀行，說那是硝化甘油
walks into a bank with a bottle, tells everybody it's nitroglycerine.

1204
01:26:27,536 --> 01:26:30,163
他從櫃檯搞了些錢
He scores some cash off of the teller.

1205
01:26:30,206 --> 01:26:33,542
走出銀行時，瓶子掉到地上
On his way out, he drops the bottle. lt cracks on the floor.

1206
01:26:33,584 --> 01:26:37,212
他滑倒跌破了頭，被逮了
He slips in it. He smacks up his head. They get him.

1207
01:26:37,296 --> 01:26:41,008
那油只是沙拉油
The nitroglycerine was canola oil.

1208
01:26:41,050 --> 01:26:44,803
搶銀行的笨賊總比高明的要多
l know more fucked-up bank robbers than ones that know what they're doing.

1209
01:26:44,887 --> 01:26:49,057
我懷疑有幾個搶銀行的知道什麼是染色袋
l doubt one in ten could tell you where the dye pack is.

1210
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:51,644
大部份搶銀行的都是蠢蛋
Most bank robbers are fucking morons.

1211
01:26:51,727 --> 01:26:56,148
讓你到床上找刺激的蠢蛋
For you to go to bed with one for kinky thrills,

1212
01:26:56,232 --> 01:26:59,568
像你說的，你也變得和他們一樣蠢
like you were saying, makes you as dumb as they are.

1213
01:26:59,610 --> 01:27:01,570
事實上，你不蠢
Now, you are not dumb.

1214
01:27:03,406 --> 01:27:08,119
你怎麼會那麼想?你怎麼認為我會那麼想?
Why would you think that? Why would you think that l would think that?

1215
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:13,290
你不蠢
You're not dumb.

1216
01:27:15,126 --> 01:27:17,294
我不曉得
Well, I don't know about that.

1217
01:27:17,378 --> 01:27:20,464
你不能跌了三跤後還認為自己不笨
l mean, you can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.

1218
01:27:21,924 --> 01:27:23,884
過來
Come here.

1219
01:27:41,527 --> 01:27:43,737
你現在對我認真了
You're getting serious on me now.

1220
01:27:46,783 --> 01:27:48,951
我盡量不想
Tryin' not to.

1221
01:27:52,038 --> 01:27:54,457
我只是想知道會發生什麼
l just want to know what's gonna happen.

1222
01:28:01,589 --> 01:28:03,507
你知道的
You know.

1223
01:28:40,618 --> 01:28:42,813
週五夜拳賽

1224
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:55,685
防守。打他上面，下面
Put it together now. Put it together! Upstairs and downstairs.

1225
01:28:55,769 --> 01:28:58,730
- 他不想在樓下見到你 - 你醉得像婊子
- He don't want to see you downstairs! - Man, you drink like a bitch!

1226
01:29:00,523 --> 01:29:03,067
別下去，準備打吧
He don't want to see you-- Get your tussle on. Joe, get your tussle on!

1227
01:29:03,151 --> 01:29:05,486
別讓他離開那個角落
Yeah, don't let him out that corner.

1228
01:29:05,529 --> 01:29:07,739
別讓他出去
Don't let him out, now.

1229
01:29:10,367 --> 01:29:13,828
我要去小便
Hey, you know what? l gotta go take a pee.

1230
01:29:13,870 --> 01:29:17,790
告訴我們幹什麼?要我們替你扶老二啊
What are you tellin' us for? You want somebody to hold your pecker?

1231
01:29:19,042 --> 01:29:21,210
幹下去，喬
Do that work, Joe!

1232
01:29:21,294 --> 01:29:23,212
鼓起精神，喬
Put it together now, Joe!

1233
01:29:23,296 --> 01:29:25,840
對了
That's it, baby!

1234
01:29:25,882 --> 01:29:29,552
扁他，好極了
Take him deep! Oh, oh, my God, l love it.

1235
01:29:29,636 --> 01:29:31,804
把他打昏，喬 把他打昏，喬
Put him to sleep, Joe! Put him to sleep, Joe!

1236
01:29:31,888 --> 01:29:34,724
坐下，肯尼，對了
Sit down, Kenny. That's it! That's it!

1237
01:30:12,721 --> 01:30:15,390
- 想偷這部車呀 - 不要!
- You tryin' to steal this car, Glenn? - Don't, don't, don't!

1238
01:30:17,101 --> 01:30:19,019
我不相信
Oh, my God, I can't believe this!

1239
01:30:19,103 --> 01:30:23,315
又倒霉了，沒一件事情搞對
Another one of those days, huh? Nothing seems to be going right.

1240
01:30:23,399 --> 01:30:25,401
- 我沒有鑰匙 - 我知道
- I don't have the keys to the car. - l see that.

1241
01:30:25,442 --> 01:30:28,319
我不是要偷這輛車
No, l mean l am not fucking stealing the car!

1242
01:30:28,404 --> 01:30:32,408
- 你不是嗎? - 不是，一周前已經偷到手了
- You're not? - No, l already stole it a week ago,

1243
01:30:32,449 --> 01:30:34,909
在西棕櫚
whenever it was, in West Palm.

1244
01:30:34,952 --> 01:30:36,954
我不可能再偷一次吧
So I can't be stealing it again, can l?

1245
01:30:37,037 --> 01:30:39,748
- 把手放在方向盤上 - 你要…
- Put your hands on the wheel, please. - Okay, so now you're gonna...

1246
01:30:39,790 --> 01:30:42,167
因為偷車逮捕我?
bust me for pickin' up a car, what the--

1247
01:30:42,251 --> 01:30:44,753
為車，為協助犯人逃獄
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape,

1248
01:30:44,795 --> 01:30:47,964
還為你到這裡搞的不管什麼名堂
and for conspiring to do whatever you came here for.

1249
01:30:48,048 --> 01:30:51,009
那些傢伙隨時都會出來找我
Listen to me. These guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me,

1250
01:30:51,093 --> 01:30:54,387
他們是禽獸
and they're fucking animals, man.

1251
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:58,808
發生什麼事，葛蘭?
What's going on, Glenn?

1252
01:30:58,851 --> 01:31:01,520
沒事，我只是想離開這鬼地方
Nothing. l just wanna get the fuck outta here.

1253
01:31:01,604 --> 01:31:03,981
我還以為這件事是你的主意
l thought this whole thing was your idea.

1254
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:06,149
打劫瑞利家是我的主意
Okay, ripping off Ripley was my idea,

1255
01:31:06,233 --> 01:31:09,986
但這些傢伙另有搞法
but these guys, they are in a whole other level of their own.

1256
01:31:10,029 --> 01:31:13,115
- 瑞利，那個華爾街的傢伙? - 計劃是…
- Ripley, the Wall Street guy? - Yeah, the plan was...

1257
01:31:13,157 --> 01:31:15,159
明天到他辦公室接他
to pick him up at his office tomorrow...

1258
01:31:15,201 --> 01:31:18,120
搭他到布倫坡他家
and drive him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.

1259
01:31:18,162 --> 01:31:21,665
現在，我不跟那鳥人做，你知道!
And now I don't give a shit what the guys do, you know?

1260
01:31:21,707 --> 01:31:25,210
- 弗理有份嗎? - 有，但他還沒出現
- And Foley was part of this. - Yeah, he's supposed to be, but he hasn't showed up yet,

1261
01:31:25,294 --> 01:31:27,462
- 那倒對他好 - 為什麼?
- which is good for him. - Why?

1262
01:31:27,505 --> 01:31:31,258
莫瑞要幹掉他……
Because Maurice is gonna kill him.

1263
01:31:31,342 --> 01:31:34,261
想拿賞金甚麼的
Like, try to collect the reward money or something.

1264
01:31:34,345 --> 01:31:37,306
但你說他還沒現身，他是打退堂鼓了嗎?
But you say he hasn't shown up yet. You think he backed out?

1265
01:31:37,348 --> 01:31:40,351
我不知道，他不會告訴我這些
I don't know. He doesn't exactly confide in me.

1266
01:31:41,394 --> 01:31:43,521
奇怪
l wonder why.

1267
01:31:43,563 --> 01:31:47,108
你如果想做，我們做了就離開這裡
Okay, if you're gonna do this, let's do it and get out of here.

1268
01:31:47,191 --> 01:31:49,610
我的屁股凍壞了
l am freezing my ass off!

1269
01:31:49,694 --> 01:31:52,196
你想溜，就跑吧，這樣會暖和些
lf you wanna get out of here, run. lt'll warm you up.

1270
01:31:52,238 --> 01:31:54,198
哦！哦！
Oh, ha, ha.

1271
01:31:59,412 --> 01:32:02,123
真的？
Really?

1272
01:32:02,206 --> 01:32:05,667
如果我發現你在騙我，我發誓……
l swear to God, Glenn, if l find out that you are lying to me, l--

1273
01:32:05,710 --> 01:32:07,712
我知道，你會找到我的
l know, you will find me. l believe it.

1274
01:32:13,384 --> 01:32:16,553
知道我在想什麼嗎?
Hey, know what l was thinkin'?

1275
01:32:16,596 --> 01:32:19,557
去年夏天如果你沒載我到聯邦法院
lf you didn't drive me to the federal court last summer,

1276
01:32:19,641 --> 01:32:21,559
你就不認識我了
you wouldn't even know who l am.

1277
01:32:21,643 --> 01:32:26,731
如果我不認識你，葛蘭，明天你不是坐牢就是死了
lf l didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.

1278
01:32:26,814 --> 01:32:29,399
要那樣去想。現在跑吧
Think of it that way. Now run.

1279
01:32:37,242 --> 01:32:39,160
耶! 耶!
Yeah! Yeah!

1280
01:32:41,746 --> 01:32:44,915
我告訴你吧，錢在這裡
I'm tellin' you, man, the money is here.

1281
01:32:44,958 --> 01:32:48,211
- 史努 - 搶銀行的
- Snoop. - Hey, it's the bank robbers.

1282
01:32:48,253 --> 01:32:50,255
我會錯過拳賽，抓把椅子來
Y'all missin' the fights, man. Pull up a chair.

1283
01:32:50,296 --> 01:32:52,756
- 誰坐在那裡 - 葛蘭
- Who's sittin' here? - Oh, that's your homey, Glenn, man.

1284
01:32:52,841 --> 01:32:54,759
他去上廁所了……
But he bounced to the bathroom a couple minutes ago...

1285
01:32:54,843 --> 01:32:56,928
- 之後我們就沒見過他 - 一定是掉到茅坑裡了
- and we ain't seen him since. - Must've fell in, man.

1286
01:32:56,970 --> 01:32:58,930
沒錯
No doubt.

1287
01:32:59,013 --> 01:33:01,515
叫那兩個人去找他，他們沒找到
Yeah, sent these two looking for him. They came back shaking their heads.

1288
01:33:03,017 --> 01:33:05,602
如果他留下外套，又離開了一陣子……
Well, if he left his coat and he's been gone a while, then--

1289
01:33:05,687 --> 01:33:07,772
車還在，我查過了
- Car's here, man. l checked. - Yeah.

1290
01:33:07,856 --> 01:33:11,109
- 我們走了 - 走了?
- All right. We're leavin'. - Leavin'?

1291
01:33:11,192 --> 01:33:13,194
- 幹嘛? - 如果葛蘭跑了…
- What the fuck, Foley? - Stupid, you know where Glenn is.

1292
01:33:13,278 --> 01:33:16,406
- 誰在乎，他什麼也不知道 - 我以為他全知道
- Look, what you worried about Glenn for, what he know? - l thought everything.

1293
01:33:16,448 --> 01:33:19,617
葛蘭以為我們明天才要干
No, Glenn know everything that's supposed to happen tomorrow.

1294
01:33:19,659 --> 01:33:23,287
就算他跑了把我們的事告訴別人，也無關緊要
Now, he may run and tell somebody that, but that don't mean shit.

1295
01:33:23,330 --> 01:33:25,957
葛蘭不知道我改變了計劃
Glenn don't know l changed the plan.

1296
01:33:25,999 --> 01:33:28,960
今天晚上一離開這裡我們就行動
It's happenin' tonight. Soon as we leave here.

1297
01:33:29,044 --> 01:33:32,297
繞到我家，拿些我們需要的傢伙，就這麼干!
Go back by the house, pick up some shit we gonna need, and we just gonna do it.

1298
01:33:38,303 --> 01:33:41,973
- 給我幾分鐘跟巴蒂商量 - 給你兩分鐘
- Give me a minute to talk to Buddy. - You got two minutes, that's all.

1299
01:33:42,015 --> 01:33:44,642
- 你作決定 - 我不是要你批准
- Make up your mind, Foley. - l wasn't asking permission.

1300
01:33:54,486 --> 01:33:57,780
- 他們會對我們下圈套 - 我有同感
- You know they're gonna set us up. - l get that feeling, yeah.

1301
01:33:57,823 --> 01:34:00,283
你想我們可以在他們之前找到鑽石嗎?
You think you can get to the diamonds before they do?

1302
01:34:02,369 --> 01:34:06,039
跟你談個交易，你現在就離開這裡
l'll make you a deal. You get outta here right now.

1303
01:34:06,123 --> 01:34:09,459
我和史努一起做，再和你見面分你一半
l'll do the job with Snoop. l'll meet you anywhere you want, give you half.

1304
01:34:09,501 --> 01:34:13,338
-為什麼分我一半? -因你幫我逃獄
-Half for doin' what? -Gettin' me out of Glades, for starters.

1305
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:17,134
誰會在背後照應你?
Who's gonna watch your back?

1306
01:36:00,154 --> 01:36:02,531
好了，白鬼，家庭訪間
All right, White Boy. House call.

1307
01:36:14,544 --> 01:36:17,296
耶, 耶, 耶
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1308
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:27,139
- 準備好了? - 好了
- Ready to do this, baby? - Ready for whatever.

1309
01:36:27,223 --> 01:36:30,142
正點!我這一套每次都管用
Cool. My shit always work.

1310
01:36:31,811 --> 01:36:34,563
長生水電
Perennial Plumbing.

1311
01:36:35,815 --> 01:36:38,609
有人打電話給我們
Somebody in the house called.

1312
01:36:38,651 --> 01:36:42,071
你搞錯了，沒人在家
You don't know what you're talking about, because no one was here.

1313
01:36:42,155 --> 01:36:44,657
- 我們去滑雪 - 耶, 耶, 耶
- Let's go skiing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1314
01:36:48,369 --> 01:36:50,329
你仍可以接受我的條件
You still got time to take me up on my offer.

1315
01:36:50,371 --> 01:36:52,998
留你和這些蠢蛋在一起?
And leave you alone with these assholes?

1316
01:36:55,168 --> 01:36:59,046
- 雷門庫茲 - 我是凱倫，我在瑞利家
- Raymond Cruz. - Ray, it's Karen Sisco. I'm at Ripley's house.

1317
01:36:59,130 --> 01:37:01,757
莫瑞米勒和另外四個人剛闖進去
l just saw Maurice Miller and four other suspects force their way into the house.

1318
01:37:01,841 --> 01:37:03,759
我需要後援
They're armed. I'm gonna need backup.

1319
01:37:04,302 --> 01:37:06,178
- 你是誰? - 我在這裡工作
- Who are you? - l work here.

1320
01:37:06,262 --> 01:37:08,347
我是女傭，別過來
I'm the maid. Fuck off!

1321
01:37:08,431 --> 01:37:11,642
我偏要這麼做，先干你，再扁你
- That's exactly what I'm gonna do: fuck you, then off you. - Hey, not yet.

1322
01:37:11,684 --> 01:37:15,145
- 端利在哪裡? - 他不在這裡
- Where Ripley at? - He isn't here.

1323
01:37:15,188 --> 01:37:19,775
- 晚上出去還是搞什麼? - 他在佛羅里達
- Out for the evening or some shit? - He's in Florida-- Palm Beach.

1324
01:37:19,859 --> 01:37:23,654
- 什麼時候回來? - 你們要等他啊
- When's he due back? - What difference does it make? You gonna wait for him?

1325
01:37:23,696 --> 01:37:28,283
瑞利先生整個季節都在那裡，從聖誕到復活節
Mr. Ripley's down for the season. Christmas to Easter.

1326
01:37:28,368 --> 01:37:31,371
少放屁
Stop that shit, man.

1327
01:37:31,413 --> 01:37:33,581
你一個人在這裡?
You're here all by yourself?

1328
01:37:33,665 --> 01:37:36,042
是的，只有我
That's right. Just me.

1329
01:37:41,381 --> 01:37:44,509
- 瑞利的保險箱和貴重品在哪? - 我不知道
- Where Ripley's safe at, keeps his valuables in? - I don't have any idea.

1330
01:37:44,551 --> 01:37:48,096
我諒你也不知道
l fuckin' bet you don't.

1331
01:37:48,179 --> 01:37:51,473
我們要上樓到他的臥室找一找
We gonna take a look upstairs in the man's bedroom, all right?

1332
01:37:51,558 --> 01:37:54,602
你和巴蒂找樓下的房間
You and Mr. Buddy look at all the rooms down here.

1333
01:37:54,686 --> 01:37:56,604
檢查那些畫，以及牆後
Check the paintings, behind the walls.

1334
01:37:56,688 --> 01:38:00,108
他一定有保險箱，在這附近
Check the fuckin' walls in the closets. The man's got a safe. It's here somewhere.

1335
01:38:00,192 --> 01:38:02,194
會不會在他佛羅里達的家裡?
What about his place down in Florida?

1336
01:38:02,235 --> 01:38:05,529
如果你先查明，我們在佛羅里達時，就先查那些牆了
lf you called, we could have checked the walls down there before we left.

1337
01:38:05,572 --> 01:38:09,033
我是說如果你願找到他的話
That is, if you'd bothered to find out where he was. You follow me?

1338
01:38:10,577 --> 01:38:12,996
把這婊子帶上樓
Man, take this bitch upstairs.

1339
01:38:13,079 --> 01:38:16,040
上樓
Upstairs!

1340
01:38:18,126 --> 01:38:20,753
你如果想按警鈴，或甚麼的話
Listen, you try and trip any alarms, anything like that,

1341
01:38:20,796 --> 01:38:23,757
你就死定了，明白嗎?
you gonna be a dead Hazel, you understand me?

1342
01:38:25,759 --> 01:38:28,344
- 我們在哪裡?保險箱在哪裡? - 那裡
- Hey, hey, where we at? Where is it? - Over there.

1343
01:38:28,428 --> 01:38:32,640
- 穿過這個嗎? - 我不滑雪
- Ever wear one of these? - I don't ski.

1344
01:38:32,724 --> 01:38:36,102
看好那個女傭，我要到處看看
Keep an eye on the maid. l'll have a look around.

1345
01:38:40,732 --> 01:38:43,443
坐下來
Go sit down. Please.

1346
01:38:48,532 --> 01:38:53,286
媽的，這痞子過這種生活
Damn, Mo. How's this motherfucker livin', man? Shit!

1347
01:38:53,328 --> 01:38:56,414
檢查牆上畫的後面
Check behind the pictures on the walls, man.

1348
01:38:59,835 --> 01:39:01,920
喂，找到一些套子
Hey, Mo. Found some rubbers.

1349
01:39:01,962 --> 01:39:04,798
白波，你為什麼在床墊下找?
White Boy, why the fuck you lookin' under the mattress?

1350
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:07,592
那傢伙不會把鑽石藏在那兒的
You know dude ain't gonna hide no diamonds under there.

1351
01:39:07,634 --> 01:39:10,136
媽的，這個痞子
Damn! Dumb 'bama motherfucker.

1352
01:39:10,179 --> 01:39:14,975
- 弗理在哪裡? - 照你說的，在檢查別的房間
- Where Foley at, man? - He's checkin' the other rooms like you said, boss.

1353
01:39:15,059 --> 01:39:19,313
盯好他
Man, keep a eye on Foley.

1354
01:39:28,322 --> 01:39:31,783
肯，別動那收音機，放張CD
Ken, stop fuckin' with the radio. Put on a CD.

1355
01:39:31,825 --> 01:39:35,453
- 這些樂隊我一個都不認識 - 隨便找一個
- I don't recognize none of these bands, Mo. - Just pick somebody.

1356
01:39:35,496 --> 01:39:37,748
什麼，「如何唱的像麥克波頓」
What, ''How To Sing Like Michael Bolton''?

1357
01:39:41,001 --> 01:39:43,586
你想聽什麼?
What the fuck you wanna listen to, huh?

1358
01:39:43,671 --> 01:39:48,175
- 我喜歡舒伯特 - 舒伯特，我不喜歡
- l like Schubert. - Schubert? Well, I don't.

1359
01:39:52,304 --> 01:39:54,597
弗理!
Uh, Foley?

1360
01:40:04,024 --> 01:40:05,984
酷
Cool.

1361
01:41:06,421 --> 01:41:08,381
911占線啊，理查
911 got you on hold, Richard?

1362
01:41:10,008 --> 01:41:11,926
- 弗理! - 還好嗎？
- Foley! - How you doin'?

1363
01:41:12,010 --> 01:41:14,220
到底發生什麼事?
What in God's name is happening here?

1364
01:41:14,262 --> 01:41:17,098
- 誰在樓上? - 史努比米勒，幾個他的朋友
- Who's upstairs? - Snoopy Miller, couple of his friends.

1365
01:41:17,181 --> 01:41:20,267
莫瑞，蘭坡監獄的那個?
- Maurice, from Lompoc? - Yup.

1366
01:41:20,310 --> 01:41:22,270
他們把美姬抓住了嗎
Have they got Midge up there?

1367
01:41:22,312 --> 01:41:24,939
有哪個男人那麼晚讓女人應門?
What kind of a man lets a woman answer the door this time of night?

1368
01:41:25,023 --> 01:41:28,651
我們以為那是她丈夫來這裡查看她
We thought it was her husband. He comes here and checks up on her.

1369
01:41:28,735 --> 01:41:30,695
我應該在佛羅里達的
I'm supposed to be down in Florida.

1370
01:41:30,778 --> 01:41:33,197
待會兒你就會巴不得自己是在佛羅里達了
ln a few minutes, you're gonna wish you were. Let's go, come on.

1371
01:41:33,281 --> 01:41:35,408
坐下，看魚吧
Why don't you sit down? We'll have a look at your fish.

1372
01:41:39,496 --> 01:41:43,541
這個行，這個行
Oh, that's workin'. That's workin'.

1373
01:41:49,297 --> 01:41:52,133
幹你娘，我找到保險箱了
Motherfucker! l found the safe, yo!

1374
01:41:54,636 --> 01:41:56,596
哪兒都別去
Don't go nowhere.

1375
01:41:59,307 --> 01:42:03,811
- 媽的，我們要慶祝一下 - 瞧那婊子
- Oh, shit! We gonna have a party! - Look at that bitch.

1376
01:42:15,407 --> 01:42:17,033
找到保險箱了
They found the safe.

1377
01:42:17,117 --> 01:42:19,786
- 干 - 巴蒂，你記得理查嗎?
- Fuck. - Buddy, you remember Richard, don't you?

1378
01:42:19,869 --> 01:42:23,414
- 嘿，房子不錯 - 謝謝
- Yeah, hi. Nice house. - Thank you.

1379
01:42:26,001 --> 01:42:28,294
我們可以敲這個把手
Yeah, man. We just all hit this handle,

1380
01:42:28,336 --> 01:42:30,296
把這炸開
blow this sucker wide open, man.

1381
01:42:30,338 --> 01:42:33,049
準備一下
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's get ready.

1382
01:42:33,133 --> 01:42:35,802
你想用這玩意兒幹掉我
Oh, Dude-- you're gonna kill me with that.

1383
01:42:39,639 --> 01:42:42,308
- 你去哪兒了? - 找到一些牛排
- Where you been, man? - Found some steaks.

1384
01:42:42,392 --> 01:42:45,269
- 牛排 - 好大一塊
- Steaks? - Yeah, some big ones, bro.

1385
01:42:45,312 --> 01:42:47,355
來吧，把這保險箱炸開
Man, come on. Blast this damn safe open, man.

1386
01:42:47,439 --> 01:42:51,401
- 他在那兒找吃的 - 蠢蛋
- He's down there lookin' for food. - Fool.

1387
01:42:51,485 --> 01:42:56,948
拿好，不對，到一邊去
All right. Hold it. No. Get to the side, man. All right.

1388
01:42:56,990 --> 01:43:00,618
數到三， 一、二、三
On three. One, two, three.

1389
01:43:02,996 --> 01:43:06,040
- 老天，他們在對美姬開槍 - 坐下，迪克
- Jesus Christ, they're shooting Midge! - Sit down, Dick.

1390
01:43:06,124 --> 01:43:08,167
他們在打開保險箱，不是你的女傭
They're trying to open up the safe, not your maid.

1391
01:43:08,252 --> 01:43:13,048
媽的
Oh, shit.

1392
01:43:13,131 --> 01:43:15,049
連個破洞也沒有
Man, we didn't even crack this sum' bitch.

1393
01:43:25,686 --> 01:43:28,146
打那門鉸鏈
- Okay, hit the hinges. - Uh-huh.

1394
01:43:28,188 --> 01:43:31,024
摀住你的耳朵，這聲音會很響
Put your finger in your ear, man. This is gonna be loud.

1395
01:43:31,066 --> 01:43:34,027
數到三，一、二……
All right, on three. One, two--

1396
01:43:34,111 --> 01:43:39,074
暗碼是3-10-44
The combination is 3-10-44.

1397
01:43:41,285 --> 01:43:44,997
- 理查的生日 - 多謝
- Richard's birthday. - Thank you.

1398
01:44:04,141 --> 01:44:06,309
他們掛了?
Are they dead?

1399
01:44:08,270 --> 01:44:10,188
我們得找弗理
We gotta find Foley, man.

1400
01:44:10,481 --> 01:44:13,275
真不敢相信事過境遷你還生我氣
Can't believe you're still angry with me after all this time.

1401
01:44:13,317 --> 01:44:16,236
我沒生你的氣，老實說，我真看開了
I'm not angry with you, Richard. ln fact, I'm completely relaxed.

1402
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:20,407
我真搞不懂，是魚讓我冷靜下來
The thing is, I can't figure if it's the fish that are cooling me out,

1403
01:44:20,491 --> 01:44:24,578
還是水箱底下那些未切割的鑽石
or all those uncut diamonds in the bottom of the tank, there.

1404
01:44:31,252 --> 01:44:33,170
該死
Goddamn.

1405
01:44:33,254 --> 01:44:35,923
葛蘭說得沒錯，那大概值五百萬吧?
Dumb-fuck Glenn was right. You got about 5 million worth in there?

1406
01:44:36,006 --> 01:44:37,924
五百二十萬
Five point two.

1407
01:44:39,635 --> 01:44:41,928
看起來就像不起眼的石頭
They just look like plain ol' rocks!

1408
01:44:42,013 --> 01:44:44,473
對，你想抓一把嗎?
They sure do. You wanna grab 'em, Buddy?

1409
01:44:51,022 --> 01:44:54,525
如果換了我是你，我拔腿就溜了
lf l were you, l'd get up and run.

1410
01:44:54,609 --> 01:44:57,778
- 我不能留下美姬 - 他們會殺了你
- I'm not leaving Midge. - Don't be an asshole. They're gonna kill you.

1411
01:44:57,862 --> 01:45:01,866
那我就認命了，我不離開她，我愛上她了
Well, if that's my fate then so be it, but I'm not leaving her. I'm in love with her.

1412
01:45:04,869 --> 01:45:08,372
- 算了，傑克 - 祝你好運，理查
- Come on, Jack. - Good luck, Richard.

1413
01:45:24,722 --> 01:45:28,267
- 快點，傑克 - 他們要強暴那個女傭，是嗎
- Come on, Jack. - Shit. They're gonna rape that maid, aren't they?

1414
01:45:28,351 --> 01:45:31,020
看樣子是
By the look of those guys, they'll rip her too.

1415
01:45:31,062 --> 01:45:33,022
- 然後再把他們幹掉 - 大概是吧
- Then they're gonna kill 'em. - At least.

1416
01:45:35,525 --> 01:45:37,443
Rip, Rip.

1417
01:45:37,527 --> 01:45:40,154
- 狗娘養的 - 那些是我的衣服嗎
- Tricky motherfucker. - Are those my suits?

1418
01:45:40,238 --> 01:45:44,158
是我的，看看你
Naw. These are my suits. Look at you, man.

1419
01:45:45,076 --> 01:45:47,036
你都躲在哪兒了?
Where you been hidin', Dick?

1420
01:45:48,371 --> 01:45:50,289
我們成了
We made it, didn't we?

1421
01:45:50,373 --> 01:45:53,584
- 先上車 - 我要回去
- All you gotta do is get in the van, baby. - I'm goin' back in.

1422
01:45:53,626 --> 01:45:57,046
- 我和你一起去 - 在機場和我碰頭
- I'm goin' with you. - No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport.

1423
01:45:57,088 --> 01:45:59,256
- 我開瑞利的車來 - 傑克--
- l'll get one of Ripley's cars. - Jack--

1424
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:03,635
你和你老姊大概會在電話裡聊這事聊上一個月
The shit that's about to go down here, you'll be on the phone with your sister for a month.

1425
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:08,141
- 我們現在扯平了 - 這兒
- All I'm sayin' is we're square. - Here.

1426
01:46:08,224 --> 01:46:10,601
耶
Yep.

1427
01:46:10,685 --> 01:46:12,603
傑克
Jack.

1428
01:46:19,944 --> 01:46:21,862
滾開
Get outta here.

1429
01:46:40,632 --> 01:46:44,052
- 把這玩意拿下來 - 滾開
- Get that shit off. - Get your hands off me!

1430
01:46:44,135 --> 01:46:47,012
閉嘴!沒人會來救你
Fuck you, shut up! Nobody's gonna help you.

1431
01:46:48,557 --> 01:46:52,143
美姬，珠寶究竟在哪裡?
- Midge! - Fuck Midge, man. Where the jewels at, Dick?

1432
01:46:52,227 --> 01:46:55,980
- 弗理拿去了 - 弗理在哪裡?
- Foley-- Foley's got them. Go after Foley! - Where the fuck is Foley, man?

1433
01:47:03,155 --> 01:47:05,073
美姬!
Midge?

1434
01:47:11,121 --> 01:47:13,456
- 美姬! - 給我坐下
- Midge! - Sit your punk ass down, man.

1435
01:47:14,666 --> 01:47:17,210
豬玀
- Ooh, goddamn! - Son of a bitch!

1436
01:47:17,294 --> 01:47:20,672
你走前門，我走後門
Man, take the front stairs. I'm gonna take the back.

1437
01:47:23,425 --> 01:47:26,261
- 你沒事吧? - 理查在哪裡
- You all right? - Where's Richard?

1438
01:47:26,345 --> 01:47:30,015
在樓下，在這兒等著
He's downstairs. You wait here.

1439
01:47:35,020 --> 01:47:38,732
不許動，把槍丟下
Hold it, asshole. Drop the gun.

1440
01:47:40,025 --> 01:47:41,943
丟下
Drop it!

1441
01:47:42,027 --> 01:47:44,070
把槍放下
Put the damn gun down, now.

1442
01:47:45,239 --> 01:47:48,033
馬上
Now!

1443
01:47:48,075 --> 01:47:51,203
放下
Put it down!

1444
01:47:54,373 --> 01:47:57,501
在那兒待著別動，莫瑞
Stay right there. Don't move. Maurice!

1445
01:47:57,543 --> 01:47:59,503
我找到弗理了
l got Foley!

1446
01:48:02,005 --> 01:48:03,923
莫瑞
Maurice!

1447
01:48:34,413 --> 01:48:37,165
沒有多的彈夾可給我用的?
Ain't got another clip l can use, do you?

1448
01:48:37,249 --> 01:48:39,542
沒有
No, I don't.

1449
01:48:42,087 --> 01:48:45,590
- 從沒開過槍吧? - 對，最近才學會
- You ain't never shot a gun before, have you? - Not until recently, no.

1450
01:48:45,674 --> 01:48:48,093
- 有點緊張 - 一點點
- You a little nervous? - Little bit, yeah.

1451
01:48:48,177 --> 01:48:52,764
在這種情況下，很可能
You know, a situation like this has a high potentiality...

1452
01:48:52,848 --> 01:48:54,766
被這些狗娘養的給逃了
for the common motherfucker to bitch out.

1453
01:48:54,850 --> 01:48:57,602
所以我想，為什麼要冒險?
So l figure, why take a chance?

1454
01:48:59,522 --> 01:49:01,440
婊子
Bitch!

1455
01:49:04,026 --> 01:49:05,944
干你娘
- Aw, sh--! - Motherfucker!

1456
01:49:41,272 --> 01:49:43,315
住手，舉起手來
Stop! Put your hands in the air!

1457
01:49:59,999 --> 01:50:01,917
傑克?
Jack?

1458
01:50:03,378 --> 01:50:06,589
- 我知道你在上面 - 呸
- l know you're up there. - Shit!

1459
01:50:09,968 --> 01:50:12,637
- 肯尼在哪裡 - 他在上面
- Where's Kenneth? - He's up here.

1460
01:50:14,931 --> 01:50:17,266
他掛了
He's dead.

1461
01:50:38,538 --> 01:50:42,250
- 算了，傑克，別這樣 - 就當不是我
- Come on, Jack, don't. - Pretend it's not me.

1462
01:50:42,333 --> 01:50:45,461
- 你以為我會對你開槍? - 你不開，別人也會開
- You think l'd shoot you? - lf you don't, somebody else will.

1463
01:50:45,545 --> 01:50:49,215
你現在算什麼?亡命之徒?
What're you now? A desperado?

1464
01:50:49,257 --> 01:50:53,344
- 把槍放下 - 我不回去坐牢
- Put the gun down. - I'm not goin' back.

1465
01:50:55,388 --> 01:50:59,600
不要逼我，把槍放下
Jack, please, don't make me do this. Put the gun down.

1466
01:51:02,395 --> 01:51:07,400
渾蛋，傑克，把槍放下
Damn it, Jack, put the gun down!

1467
01:51:07,484 --> 01:51:09,402
沒有時間了
No more time-outs.

1468
01:51:18,703 --> 01:51:21,414
算你贏，傑克
You win, Jack.

1469
01:51:29,923 --> 01:51:33,384
- 我沒法射你 - 你開了，你射中我
- I can't shoot you. - You did. You shot me.

1470
01:51:33,427 --> 01:51:35,679
你知道我的
You know what l mean.

1471
01:51:49,192 --> 01:51:53,779
抱歉，我真希望事情不這樣
I'm sorry. l wish things were different.

1472
01:52:36,907 --> 01:52:38,825
機場
Airport.

1473
01:53:05,978 --> 01:53:09,773
他們還沒確定是否要控他殺人罪
Yeah, they don't know yet if they want to bring him up on the homicides.

1474
01:53:09,857 --> 01:53:12,693
我想不會，他們會把他在關一陣子
l doubt if they will. They'll just put a detainer on him.

1475
01:53:12,735 --> 01:53:15,696
等審完以後，他會回佛羅里達
When they're through with him here, he'll go back to Florida.

1476
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:18,115
你會把他押解回來嗎?
Are you gonna go get him?

1477
01:53:18,199 --> 01:53:20,409
可能，幹嘛
It's possible. Why?

1478
01:53:20,493 --> 01:53:22,411
想想而已
Well, you know, l was just thinkin'.

1479
01:53:22,495 --> 01:53:24,413
你可以一路上和他逍遙
You can have a nice time with him on the ride down,

1480
01:53:24,497 --> 01:53:27,500
續上你們之間的那段插曲
picking up where your interlude or whatever you call it left off,

1481
01:53:27,541 --> 01:53:30,377
然後把他扔回監獄
and then you can throw him in the shithouse.

1482
01:53:31,879 --> 01:53:34,131
他知道自己在做什麼
He knew what he was doing.

1483
01:53:34,215 --> 01:53:37,092
沒人逼他搶銀行
Nobody forced him to rob banks.

1484
01:53:38,386 --> 01:53:42,223
我可憐的女兒，真堅強
My little girl-- the tough babe.

1485
01:53:42,264 --> 01:53:44,224
我稍後再和你連絡
l'll call you later.

1486
01:53:44,267 --> 01:53:46,435
再見
Good-bye.

1487
01:54:03,828 --> 01:54:06,080
傑克
Jack.

1488
01:54:08,666 --> 01:54:10,584
給你一個禮物
l got you a present.

1489
01:54:13,379 --> 01:54:15,422
路上用的
Something for the road.

1490
01:54:27,393 --> 01:54:32,022
不過，旅途結束後我還是要收回的
I'm gonna have to take it away, though, soon as the ride is over.

1491
01:54:44,702 --> 01:54:47,621
傑克弗理?來見海極亨利
Jack Foley? Meet Hijirah Henry.

1492
01:54:58,299 --> 01:55:00,259
這個名字很特別
What kind of a name is Hijirah?

1493
01:55:00,301 --> 01:55:03,804
- 是回教名字 - 代表什麼?
- It's lslamic. - What's it stand for?

1494
01:55:03,847 --> 01:55:07,308
「海極」是西元622年墨罕默得逃離麥加意思
The ''Hijirah'' was Mohammed's flight from Mecca in 622.

1495
01:55:07,350 --> 01:55:11,812
- 他的逃離? - 利文沃的兄弟給我取的名字
- His flight? - Brothers in Leavenworth gave me that name.

1496
01:55:11,896 --> 01:55:13,814
你在和利文沃待過?
You were in Leavenworth, huh?

1497
01:55:13,898 --> 01:55:16,859
- 待過一段日子 - 什麼意思?
- For a time. - Meaning?

1498
01:55:16,943 --> 01:55:19,987
- 時間到我就走了 - 你逃跑了
- Meaning, time came, l left. - You busted out.

1499
01:55:20,030 --> 01:55:23,575
是從自己不願待的地方離開
l prefer to think of it as an exodus from an undesirable place.

1500
01:55:26,870 --> 01:55:29,205
- 過多久你又被逮到? - 那一次嗎?
- How long before they caught up with you? - That time?

1501
01:55:31,499 --> 01:55:34,835
- 還有多少次啊? - 那是第九次
- There were others? - Yeah. That was the ninth.

1502
01:55:36,838 --> 01:55:39,298
第九次?
The ninth?

1503
01:55:39,341 --> 01:55:43,178
如果把那次從監獄醫院逃走也算的話，就是第十次
Well, ten if you count that prison hospital in Ohio l walked away from.

1504
01:55:43,220 --> 01:55:46,014
- 亨利，你倒蹺頭不少次 - 海極
- You done a lot of walkin', Henry. - Hijirah.

1505
01:55:46,097 --> 01:55:49,475
我們現在出發去葛雷茲
Hijirah. Now we're off to Glades.

1506
01:55:49,518 --> 01:55:53,688
好像是吧
Yeah, it looks that way.

1507
01:55:53,730 --> 01:55:56,482
我昨天晚上本來應該跟一個女警官走的
l was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal,

1508
01:55:56,525 --> 01:55:59,903
不知為什麼她要等
but for some reason she wanted to wait.

1509
01:55:59,986 --> 01:56:03,864
- 是嗎? - 我想兩人坐車省點錢吧
- She did, huh? - Guess it's cheaper taking two of us down in one van.

1510
01:56:03,949 --> 01:56:09,204
可能，說不定她以為我們有很多可聊的
Could be. Maybe she thought we had a lot to talk about.

1511
01:56:09,246 --> 01:56:11,331
是嗎?聊什麼?
Really? Like what?

1512
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:17,546
我不知道，到佛羅里達有好一段路要走
I don't know. Long ride to Florida.

1513
