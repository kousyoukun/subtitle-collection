1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,556
This is Paul Jensen speaking.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,074
The picture we are about to watch,
<i>The Mummy,</i>

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,392
exemplifies what is best in the
American horror films of the early 1930s.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,233
This is due to the skill
and sensitivity of many people,

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,198
but especially the film's star,
Boris Karloff,

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,956
its director, Karl Freund,
and its screenwriter, John L Balderston.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,034
Also making an important contribution
is Karloff's co-star, Zita Johann,

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,430
whose voice and looks
are simultaneously exotic and natural,

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,397
vulnerable and seductive.

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,836
We must not overlook the support
provided by the other performers

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,630
in this well-cast film,
especially David Manners, Arthur Byron,

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,314
Edward Van Sloan and Bramwell Fletcher.

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,036
Balderston begins his story
with an archaeological expedition

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,588
in the Egypt of 1921.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,470
By doing so, he deliberately evokes
the November 1922 discovery

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,313
of Tutankhamen's unplundered tomb,

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,756
a discovery which had tremendous
impact on the popular press

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,550
and the popular imagination - an impact
that remained for quite a few years.

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,157
Howard Carter's excavation
of the tomb was methodical.

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,949
Its inner chamber was not even opened
until three months later.

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,589
The Pharaoh's mummy
was not unwrapped until 1925.

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,309
Artefacts were first displayed
in Cairo's museum in 1929,

23
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,073
and the tomb was not fully cleared
until February 1932,

24
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,153
just a month before Balderston
began writing this film.

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,308
Attracting a more sensational kind of
attention was the tomb's supposed curse,

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,190
which reporters mentioned when anyone
connected with the expedition died.

27
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,912
In 1926 a <i>New York Times</i> front-page
article quoted an Egyptologist as being,

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,070
like Dr Muller in this film,

29
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,833
"absolutely convinced"
that the ancients could

30
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,674
"concentrate upon and around a mummy,
certain dynamic powers of which

31
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,150
we possess very incomplete notions."

32
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,631
As late as 1930, a <i>Times</i> article
summarised the deaths

33
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,757
of 14 people connected
with Tutankhamen's tomb.

34
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,874
In this shot and the next,
note the lamp in the foreground.

35
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,953
This is the kind of extra detail
that gives visual interest to the images,

36
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,352
while making us aware of the object
a short time before it will be used.

37
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,313
These archaeologists have the task of
informing us about the present situation.

38
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,552
Most of the things we need to know are
things the characters are just learning,

39
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,632
so the exposition arises naturally.

40
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,315
A great deal of information
is offered gradually, in stages,

41
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,198
starting with general background
about the expedition

42
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,875
presented through two contrasting
attitudes to archaeology.

43
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,999
Whemple, older and more experienced,
advocates patience and method,

44
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,593
while the younger Norton
is excitable and impulsive.

45
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,995
As it makes the contrast, the script resists
temptation to ridicule either viewpoint.

46
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,675
Each man is sympathetic
and understandable.

47
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,196
After introducing Whemple and Norton
and the general situation,

48
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,149
the scene shifts our attention to Dr Muller,
and through him, to the mummy.

49
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,789
Both have been visible on the sidelines
in a couple of earlier shots.

50
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,431
Muller notes that the viscera were not
removed and the body not embalmed.

51
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,150
This man seems to have died
in some sensationally unpleasant manner,

52
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,470
struggling in his bandages.

53
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,839
Clearly, he was buried alive. He probably
was punished for some kind of sacrilege.

54
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,230
The mummy is identified
as that of Imhotep,

55
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,118
high priest of
the Temple of the Sun at Karnak.

56
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,317
Muller also notes that the sacred spells
that protect the soul

57
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,836
in its journey into the underworld
were chipped off.

58
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,310
So Imhotep was sent
to his death in the next world too.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,356
Now attention shifts to a box
on the foreground table.

60
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,309
It is not an easy object to get at,
causing a delay which builds anticipation.

61
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,793
First they must remove it
from an outer wooden casing.

62
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,235
Then they carry it to a new position.

63
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,556
Whemple determines
that the inner box is made of gold.

64
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,955
Also, it bears the unbroken seal
of the Pharaoh Amenophis.

65
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,429
Whemple soon breaks the seal.

66
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,115
But he does so perhaps a little too
casually for a truly methodical scientist.

67
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,749
Inside is still another box.

68
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,878
On it, they read an ancient curse.

69
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,555
Note the composition
as two figures frame the hieroglyphs,

70
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,111
then, as attention is drawn to
the inscription, the camera moves closer.

71
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,234
Whemple and Muller are impressed.
Muller urges caution.

72
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,388
But although Whemple accepts
Muller's mastery of the occult sciences,

73
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,472
he, like Norton, wants
to examine the contents.

74
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,836
Norton, meanwhile,
eagerly dismisses the curse.

75
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,590
Muller, impatient with the young man,
takes Whemple out under Egypt's stars.

76
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,752
This is, of course, the author's device
to leave Norton alone,

77
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,479
but it is one that draws out
Muller's personality

78
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,393
and also evokes
a bit of Egyptian atmosphere.

79
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,030
The two settings are now intercut,

80
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,318
with the older man establishing that
the box might contain the Scroll of Thoth

81
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,550
and explaining its powers.

82
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,359
It is an adroit strategy
for Balderston and Freund

83
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,716
to alternate between this exposition -
which is passive -

84
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,031
and Norton's actions,
which move the story forward

85
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,839
and are among the most gripping
in the film.

86
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,672
Notice this very compact composition,
which includes Norton and the lamp,

87
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,957
with a portion of the box,
tempting him, on our left.

88
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,111
As Norton looks closer,
the camera pulls back.

89
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,038
In the next shot, the camera's gliding
movement to the other side of the table

90
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,636
gives the box central importance visually,
but not in an arbitrary fashion,

91
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,510
for the camera moves in synchronisation
with Norton's movement of the lamp.

92
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,798
Freund uses a fairly large number
of different shots -

93
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,635
ten in this short section, which lasts
slightly longer than two minutes.

94
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,473
He also avoids the use
of background music,

95
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,951
with silence heightening
the scene's ominous, oppressive mood.

96
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,193
To dramatise the moment
of removing the scroll,

97
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,635
Freund cuts to empty space

98
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,156
and has Norton's head
move into view in close-up.

99
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,231
Then he pans down to Norton's hands.

100
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:26,350
Norton pauses to wipe his hands.
The tension has made him sweat.

101
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,352
He doesn't want to damage the papyrus
when he touches it.

102
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,000
The action starts to feel ceremonial.

103
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,914
Now Freund is about to cut to a new shot,

104
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,310
in which the camera
is placed in a lower position,

105
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,190
so that as Norton unrolls the scroll
it ends up being quite large in the frame.

106
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,314
Outside, Muller puts the events we have
just seen and are about to see in context

107
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,630
when he urges Whemple
to put the box back,

108
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,280
reminding him, and us, about the curse.

109
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:23,559
Next, Freund uses film's ability to let
viewers know things a character does not.

110
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,757
His camera becomes independent.
It knows where to look,

111
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,308
but we have no way of warning Norton.

112
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,233
Then Freund cuts
to a close-up of the mummy.

113
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,949
We see its eyes open slightly,

114
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,997
then he tilts down to the arms
as they slowly unfold.

115
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:21,310
Freund cuts back to Norton, still oblivious
of what is happening behind him.

116
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,397
Freund tilts down to the scroll,
and after a few seconds a hand enters.

117
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,230
The slow lead-up that emphasised
camera movement is climaxed now

118
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,437
with four sudden cuts
keyed to Norton's shock.

119
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,717
Again, Freund has him move
into a shot for emphasis.

120
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,475
While Norton laughs,
the camera moves to the doorway,

121
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,120
then to the case, then down to the box.

122
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,748
These details summarise the action,
not through crisp editing, but gradually,

123
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,356
through camera movements that create
anticipation and dreadful inevitability -

124
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,796
feelings heightened
by the off-screen mad laughter.

125
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,394
This sequence does not use dialogue
to legitimise what we have seen.

126
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,836
It is a <i>tour-de-force</i> use of images
and sound to depict events,

127
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,152
to create atmosphere and to evoke horror,
all through implication.

128
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,713
This involves viewers
by requiring attentiveness

129
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,950
and imaginative collaboration.

130
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,350
The result is both understated
and intense.

131
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,000
The final image sums up the situation,

132
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,311
placing a dusty handprint
next to Norton's transcription of the scroll.

133
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,919
This scene has the rather undramatic task
of introducing new characters

134
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,594
and summarising the past ten years.

135
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,151
We learn that Frank is Whemple's son,
that this expedition has had little success,

136
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,075
that ten years earlier Whemple found
too much and refused to return,

137
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,993
and that Norton went mad
and eventually died.

138
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,230
All of this information is efficiently
conveyed in about 90 seconds.

139
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,074
The filmmakers liven up this rather
passive conversation in three ways.

140
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,358
They begin by having Frank notice
and mention the approach of a visitor,

141
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,479
which reassures viewers that something
will probably happen soon.

142
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,792
The slatted shadows that fall
on the two men add texture to the image.

143
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,754
And the action of Frank
taking out a cigarette

144
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,196
and Professor Pearson offering a match
gives us something to watch

145
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,794
while the dialogue does its duty.

146
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,071
Boris Karloff's real entrance
in the film occurs now,

147
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,995
almost 14 minutes after its start.
When Karloff opens the door,

148
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,998
notice how quickly and unobtrusively
he brings his left arm back to his side,

149
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,675
so that after the door swings open
he seems not to have moved at all,

150
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,637
as if the door opened by itself.

151
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,598
In a close-up, his eyes shift
sharply to his left,

152
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,035
while his head does not change position.

153
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,078
These details of Karloff's performance
help establish

154
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,631
the character's controlled, deliberate
nature at the moment of his entrance.

155
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,678
Although never stated,
it is clear that this man,

156
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,709
who calls himself Ardath Bey, is Imhotep,
after removing his mummy wrappings.

157
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,593
He is now a living person, an independent
being with thoughts and will and feeling -

158
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,151
very different from the shambling
automaton in most later mummy films.

159
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,872
Karloff is probably best known for his
performance as Frankenstein's monster.

160
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,794
However, that dangerous-but-innocent
route does not represent the actor

161
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,270
at his most typical
or display all his strengths.

162
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,432
The first real showcase for Karloff
was <i>The Mask of Fu Manchu,</i>

163
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,273
made just before this film, in 1932.

164
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,388
In it he played an articulate,
sardonic, flamboyant sadist.

165
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,395
However, that film's production was too
chaotic to result in a truly satisfying work.

166
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,711
Indeed, after enduring
the extensive rewriting of scenes

167
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,109
during the production
of <i>The Mask Of Fu Manchu,</i>

168
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,274
the actor must have found <i>The Mummy's</i>
carefully preplanned screenplay a relief.

169
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,119
Thus, it was <i>The Mummy</i> which first
gave Karloff's physical and vocal talents

170
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,031
an ideal setting.

171
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,079
Earlier, in his coming-to-life scene,
Karloff had been heavily made up.

172
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,029
He reportedly spent eight hours being
made up and wrapped up for this scene.

173
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,557
Given that fact, the filmmakers reveal
an amazing degree of restraint,

174
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,509
and considerable dramatic wisdom,
by not showing his full figure in motion.

175
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,318
Instead, he was just a face
and arms and a hand.

176
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,392
Now the camera lingers on him
in unwrapped form

177
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,315
as the actor fully captures what
the script describes as "slow dignity"

178
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,834
and "uncanny force and power".

179
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,476
Karloff's gaunt features, his angular form
and his lisping articulation

180
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,311
tend to make such
an immediately powerful impression

181
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,837
that no matter what he does or says
he runs the risk of overemphasis.

182
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,754
Because of this larger-than-life aura,
he tends to be most convincing

183
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,957
when playing an understated,
restrained character.

184
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,316
On those occasions,
his extraordinary appearance and voice

185
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,599
suggest that behind the restraint lie
a bitter intelligence and unrelenting will

186
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,196
which could, at any moment,
break free with overwhelming power.

187
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,431
Imhotep is a menace,
a single-minded obsessive

188
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,671
who has the power
to implement his obsession.

189
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,230
He also is a sympathetic figure
who once dared the gods' wrath

190
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,073
in an attempt to return his lover to life

191
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:08,598
and who now, 3700 years later,
finds himself with a second chance.

192
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,233
His threat is strongly felt, as is
his suffering and his enduring passion.

193
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:01,513
After an efficient transition,
we enter the Egyptian Museum in Cairo

194
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,388
and the room containing items
from Anck-es-en-Amon's tomb.

195
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:18,192
Here we see Freund's camera prowl past
display cases and among the artefacts

196
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,475
until it reaches Imhotep...

197
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,632
who gazes intently
at Anck-es-en-Amon's mummy.

198
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,032
The deep tones of a bassoon give
the image a mournful and ominous mood.

199
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,873
From a shot of Anck-es-en-Amon's face
on her mummy case,

200
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,272
there is a rapid pan across the city, which
stops on the face of Helen Grosvenor,

201
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,592
connecting her with Anck-es-en-Amon
and with Imhotep -

202
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,195
well before any of the characters
are aware of a link.

203
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,831
Such an abstract affinity across space
and, in a sense, across time

204
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,718
echoes a quality
of romanticism in general,

205
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,712
and of German expressionist films
in particular.

206
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,314
Technically, this device
has a specific precedent

207
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,793
in the 1931 Warner Bros film, <i>Svengali,</i>
in which the camera travels across a city

208
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,872
to connect Svengali
with the woman he controls.

209
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,756
Dr Muller's conversation with Helen
gives us a little information about her.

210
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,116
At one point he calls her
"my most interesting patient",

211
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,671
a line that is particularly intriguing
because it is left unexplained.

212
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,910
This scene's rather natural
exposition is followed

213
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,389
by the epitome of blatant exposition,

214
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,156
as two unknown men we will never see
again discuss Helen for our benefit.

215
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,793
The script now continues developing
its two parallel plot threads.

216
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,713
After Whemple says
that the museum is closing,

217
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,836
the rather ordinary response
"I did not notice the time"

218
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,117
gains an interesting irony
when spoken by Imhotep,

219
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,597
to whom time has a very special meaning.

220
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,878
When Whemple offers his hand,
Imhotep glances down and ignores it.

221
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,677
It is typical of Freund's
natural understated staging

222
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,069
that the moment receives no emphasis.

223
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,073
Soon after, as Whemple reaches
to guide Imhotep's elbow,

224
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,551
his visitor explains "I dislike
to be touched. An Eastern prejudice."

225
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,191
Imhotep appreciates the irony
of this reversal of the usual attitude.

226
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,118
In this scene, note the subtle difference

227
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,636
between the straightforward
lighting in the long shot...

228
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,552
and in the separate shot of Frank
and the more shadowy image of Imhotep.

229
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,593
A key to Karloff's performance
is the fact that the character's fragility

230
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,229
makes him avoid physical activity
or even contact,

231
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,199
holding his body erect and still
with his arms at his sides,

232
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,192
he is a quietly forceful centre of attention.

233
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,513
By doing nothing, he appears completely
in control - of himself and of the situation.

234
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,156
At the same time, Karloff's vocal tone
gives his dialogue a haunted resonance

235
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,913
to which he adds an edge
of ironic politeness,

236
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,959
blending dignity with quiet frustration
and brooding menace.

237
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,678
Karl Freund's camera
again tracks through the museum,

238
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,198
this time to discover Imhotep kneeling
with the Scroll of Thoth and the lamp

239
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,068
as he attempts to bring life back
to Anck-es-en-Amon's body.

240
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,510
Earlier, the camera
had moved across Cairo

241
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,239
to link Helen with
Anck-es-en-Amon and Imhotep.

242
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,189
Now editing develops that link,
by revealing the impact his incantations

243
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,716
and the repeated name
"Anck-es-en-Amon" have on Helen.

244
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,314
An impact of which Imhotep is unaware.

245
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,631
Eleven cuts establish the long-distance
power of Imhotep and the scroll.

246
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:34,078
Notice that Freund took the extra trouble
to film several different views of Imhotep,

247
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,358
rather than return each time
to the same camera and lighting setup.

248
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,238
And the lighting produces
some marvellously dramatic

249
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,880
and mysterious shadows on his face.

250
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:50,073
Yet those shadows have a natural source -
the lamp on the floor below him.

251
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,873
The stately rhythm
of this intercutting is reminiscent

252
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,838
of some German films of the 1920s,

253
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:11,075
notably FW Murnau's 1922 version
of <i>Dracula,</i> entitled <i>Nosferatu,</i>

254
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,799
in which similar editing evokes the fact

255
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,031
that the heroine senses
the vampire's approach

256
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,873
and is drawn to watch
for his ship's arrival.

257
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,993
In both works, film technique
evokes a romantic attraction

258
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,356
that is inseparable
from a fatalistic sense of doom.

259
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,749
Freund did not work on <i>Nosferatu,</i> but did
photograph many of Murnau's other films,

260
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,719
and he was a key figure
in the German film industry at that time.

261
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,636
When Helen arrives at the museum and,
trying to get in, collapses at the door,

262
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,711
Frank is on his way out,

263
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,509
so their paths now cross
in a reasonably natural fashion,

264
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,956
which brings the separate
plot strands together.

265
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,237
Cut, but probably shot, was a short scene

266
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,278
in which Whemple pays
Helen's taxi driver

267
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,148
and one in which they decide
not to take her directly to a hospital.

268
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,915
Also, in the script, the death
of the museum guard comes next,

269
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,912
before the scene with Helen
which now follows.

270
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,594
In this scene, Helen repeats Imhotep's
name, which reveals her connection,

271
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,992
even though Whemple and Frank
do not yet understand its implications.

272
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,392
Whemple recognises that she is speaking
the language of Ancient Egypt.

273
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,598
But one might wonder,
if it has not been heard for 2,000 years,

274
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,719
how he knows what it sounds like,
and even how to speak it himself.

275
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,635
When a museum guard investigates,

276
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,554
the camera follows his flashlight beam
as it searches the room.

277
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,189
This is a clear link between <i>The Mummy</i>
and Freund's work in Germany,

278
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:40,671
where, eight years earlier, he collaborated
with FW Murnau on <i>Der Letzte Mann,</i>

279
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,320
known in English as <i>The Last Laugh.</i>

280
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,313
In that film, the camera similarly follows
a watchman's lightbeam

281
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,914
as it moves along a hotel corridor.

282
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,515
In both cases,
light itself becomes a dramatic element.

283
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,756
The plot's alternation between Imhotep
and Helen continues as Muller visits her.

284
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,958
His arrival is filmed simply,
but it does establish a new character,

285
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,600
the Nubian servant,
played by Noble Johnson,

286
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,478
who appeared in Universal's
<i>Murders In The Rue Morgue</i>

287
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,279
and would soon be seen
in RKO's <i>King Kong.</i>

288
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:22,920
Zita Johann's small stature and round
face, her large eyes and haunting voice,

289
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,596
and a quality of exotic vulnerability
set her apart from the usual ingénue,

290
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,913
making her immediately recognisable,
even if one has seen her only in this role.

291
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,677
John Balderston initially suggested
testing Katharine Hepburn for the part.

292
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:44,596
Miss Johann was born in 1904 in an area
of Hungary that is now part of Romania,

293
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,389
and she came to the United States
with her family at the age of seven.

294
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,199
Her Broadway career began in 1924,

295
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,193
and her first screen appearance
was in director DW Griffith's final film,

296
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,714
<i>The Struggle,</i> in 1931.

297
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,237
Then for Warner Bros she played opposite
Edward G Robinson in <i>Tiger Shark.</i>

298
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,517
<i>The Mummy</i> was her third film.
She made a few others

299
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,071
but, dissatisfied with Hollywood,
she returned to the New York stage.

300
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,153
Her husband, while she was making
this film, was John Houseman,

301
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,756
who soon would collaborate with
Orson Welles in the theatre and on radio.

302
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,559
Miss Johann died in 1993.

303
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,599
David Manners may lack
unusual characteristics,

304
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,593
but he mixed a handsome appearance
with a pleasant and responsible manner,

305
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,798
which was not all that common
in young leading men of the early 1930s.

306
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,917
A Canadian, he was born in 1901.

307
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,154
His first screen appearance was in James
Whale's film <i>Journey's End</i> in 1930.

308
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,994
Before making <i>The Mummy</i> he appeared
with George Arliss in <i>The Millionaire,</i>

309
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,436
with Katharine Hepburn and
John Barrymore in <i>A Bill of Divorcement,</i>

310
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,750
in Frank Capra's <i>The Miracle Woman,</i>

311
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,515
and in the lost-generation drama
<i>The Last Flight.</i>

312
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,872
Despite his success,
Manners lost interest in films

313
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,633
and left the profession around 1936.

314
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,429
He died at the age of 97 in 1998.

315
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,908
Frank reveals to Helen that handling
Anck-es-en-Amon's possessions

316
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,309
led him to feel as if he knew her,

317
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,678
and he admits that when he saw her face
he sort of fell in love with her.

318
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,390
Helen jokingly asks if he has to open
graves to find girls to fall in love with.

319
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,395
But the issue is more subtly emotional
than just necrophilia or a love of the dead.

320
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,315
Frank feels attracted to a woman from
the past who therefore is unattainable.

321
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,638
He is drawn into an emotion doomed to
frustration - a desire impossible to satisfy.

322
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,829
This creates a parallel with Imhotep,

323
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,879
who was and is passionately committed
to the unattainable -

324
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,157
first a vestal virgin, then a dead woman,

325
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,834
now a woman
dead for thousands of years.

326
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,115
Frank has just noticed Helen's
resemblance to Anck-es-en-Amon,

327
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,033
so he can now transfer
his infatuation to her.

328
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,957
Before long,
Imhotep will make the same discovery.

329
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,316
The guard had been killed off-screen,

330
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:38,076
a typically discreet and understated
approach, and one that fits the situation,

331
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,994
for it protects Imhotep's aura of fragility

332
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,675
by not showing him perform
an energetic, physical act.

333
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,990
However, it leads to a logical problem,

334
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,756
because there is no clear reason
why Imhotep left the scroll behind.

335
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,355
Balderston's shooting script
accounted for this by having Imhotep

336
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,398
try to remove the scroll
from the dead guard's hand

337
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,109
and be interrupted by a second guard
who sets off alarm bells,

338
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,794
turns on the lights and pulls out his gun.

339
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,793
This prompts Imhotep to rise
and, catlike, slink away.

340
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,638
It is not clear why the film leaves this out.

341
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,031
After the scene with the police
and the dead guard,

342
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,272
the script has Frank ask Helen
why Muller calls her "his patient",

343
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,715
but she avoids a direct answer.

344
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:31,113
Then Imhotep, at his pool, watches Muller
and Whemple return home with the scroll,

345
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,398
which explains why Imhotep arrives
at the house a short time later.

346
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,834
Arthur Byron, who plays Whemple,

347
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,959
entered films around 1932,
when he was 60 years old,

348
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,031
and after a Broadway stage career

349
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,113
that included the role of the warden
in 1929's <i>The Criminal Code</i> - 

350
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,510
the film version of which
included Karloff in the cast.

351
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,754
In January 1932, he acted in
<i>The Devil Passes</i> with Earnest Thesiger,

352
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,709
just before that actor appeared with
Karloff in Universal's <i>The Old Dark House.</i>

353
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,792
Arthur Byron died in 1943.

354
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,399
The role of Dr Muller was practically
written for Edward Van Sloan,

355
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,755
a Broadway veteran
who played Dr Van Helsing

356
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,434
in the stage and film versions of <i>Dracula.</i>

357
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,310
He also played Dr Waldman
in the film <i>Frankenstein.</i>

358
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:25,554
For variety, he portrayed a sadist
in the 1932 film <i>Behind the Mask.</i>

359
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,639
The actor who played Norton in
the first sequence was Bramwell Fletcher,

360
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,280
an Englishman who was born in 1904.

361
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,639
He made his stage debut at the age of 13
and his film debut the following year.

362
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,236
Prior to <i>The Mummy,</i> he acted
in <i>Svengali</i> with John Barrymore,

363
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,073
<i>The Millionaire</i> with George Arliss
and David Manners

364
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,278
and <i>A Bill of Divorcement</i> in which
he rejoined Barrymore and Manners.

365
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:55,388
His first wife, of four, was Helen Chandler,
who played Mina in <i>Dracula.</i>

366
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,075
Dissatisfied with Hollywood,
he returned to the New York stage.

367
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,038
In the 1960s he wrote and then toured

368
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,112
in a one-man show
about George Bernard Shaw.

369
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,589
He died in 1988.

370
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,153
Now Imhotep enters, seeking the scroll.

371
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,919
Earlier, when Muller arrived,
Freund used only a single long shot.

372
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,879
Here he lingers on separate close shots
of the Nubian and Imhotep.

373
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,793
In a close-up,
a subtle change in the lighting

374
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,032
causes Imhotep's eyes to brighten
with intensity and mystic power,

375
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,793
as he places the Nubian under his control.

376
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,149
Here, at virtually the film's midpoint,

377
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:58,030
Imhotep and Helen will meet for
the first time and realise their connection.

378
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,550
Before this point, all Imhotep wanted
was to revive the mummy of his lover,

379
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,676
for which he needs the scroll.

380
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,833
Now, however, the situation
becomes much more complicated.

381
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,713
The relationship between Imhotep
and Helen seems so appropriate,

382
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,268
even inevitable,
that it comes almost as a shock

383
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,672
to realise how different it is
from the original concept for the film.

384
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,194
The project originated
with Nina Wilcox Putnam,

385
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,990
a popular author of stories for magazines
like the <i>Saturday Evening Post.</i>

386
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,436
Independent in her life
and assertive in her opinions,

387
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,478
she was an early advocate
of women's rights.

388
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,599
In her fiction she usually dealt with
women's domestic and professional lives

389
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,912
in a humorous style,
so it is surprising that in 1932

390
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,356
she supplied Universal
with stories for a 'Tom Mix' Western

391
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,000
and a Boris Karloff horror film.

392
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,553
By the first week of February 1932,

393
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,235
Putnam completed <i>Cagliostro,</i>
a nine-page story.

394
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,034
Then she and Richard Schayer, the head
of Universal's scenario department,

395
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,749
developed it into a more extended form,
dated February 19.

396
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,752
In Putnam's plot, a Dr Astro,

397
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,953
a spiritualist in modern San Francisco,

398
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,794
is actually an Egyptian priest
who has stayed alive for 4,000 years

399
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,519
by injecting himself with nitrates.

400
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,229
At one point in his history,
prior to the French Revolution,

401
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,834
he was the notorious Cagliostro,

402
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,672
whose seances were popular
in Parisian high society.

403
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,070
He observes people
with a television surveillance system

404
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:40,870
and his death ray homes in on medallions
which he gives to intended victims.

405
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,158
With these devices, he commits robberies
and eliminates enemies.

406
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,913
He is served by a mute Nubian.

407
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,278
The heroine Helen Dorington works
selling tickets at a movie theatre.

408
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:57,036
Helen's boyfriend Dr Jack Foster was
physician to millionaire HG Whemple,

409
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,076
who was killed by the death ray.

410
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,197
Whemple, deeply religious,
resented as sacrilege

411
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,590
the archaeological achievements
of his brother Professor Whemple,

412
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,478
and therefore left his money
in trust to Jack.

413
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,235
This leads the police to suspect
Jack of Whemple's murder.

414
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,835
Astro poses as the blind,
long-lost uncle of Helen,

415
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,912
who happens to resemble
his ancient mistress.

416
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,390
He rents Whemple's mansion
and gets Helen to work for him,

417
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,948
but she senses something uncanny
in the house

418
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,112
and notices that his hands
leave dusty imprints.

419
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,114
Meanwhile, Jack seeks to expose Astro
the spiritualist as a charlatan.

420
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,478
Jack and Professor Whemple investigate
a series of sensational robberies.

421
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,997
Later, Helen tries to leave but is
imprisoned in the cellar by the Nubian.

422
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,631
While Astro is busy trying to steal nitrates
from a safe-deposit vault,

423
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,952
the professor invades the house
and takes Astro's nitrate supply.

424
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,830
Astro's theft is not completed,
but the professor is thrown in the cellar.

425
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:01,914
They are rescued by Jack when Astro
crumbles to dust without his nitrates.

426
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,636
In Nina Wilcox Putnam's
early version of the story,

427
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,712
Astro was betrayed
by his lover in Ancient Egypt,

428
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,155
so he spends the centuries
avenging himself

429
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,913
by destroying women who resemble her.

430
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,915
In other words, <i>The Mummy</i> originated
as not a love story, but a hate story.

431
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,396
One finds little resemblance
to <i>The Mummy</i>

432
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,792
in this tangle of arbitrary events
and contrived relationships.

433
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,792
To impose dramatic coherence
on <i>Cagliostro,</i>

434
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,670
Universal sought out John L Balderston,
a former magazine editor and journalist

435
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,673
who had cowritten
the popular 1926 play <i>Berkeley Square.</i>

436
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,279
He also adapted Hamilton Deane's play
<i>Dracula</i> for American audiences

437
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:48,319
and did the same for Peggy Webling's
play version of <i>Frankenstein.</i>

438
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,758
Both these works provided Universal with
the basis for successful films in 1931.

439
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,355
But Balderston had not written
a film script before.

440
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,035
He arrived in Hollywood
near the end of March, 1932,

441
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:05,318
and set to work transforming the muddle
that was <i>Cagliostro.</i>

442
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,709
He retained some elements
of Putnam's plots,

443
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,669
which he mixed with inspirations drawn
from other sources in his imagination.

444
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,833
Balderston's first incomplete screenplay,
dated June 30,

445
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,957
was followed by
a complete version on July 13,

446
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,793
then five more
during August and September.

447
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,919
The last, dated September 12,

448
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,231
was published by
Magiclmage Filmbooks in 1989.

449
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,558
As Balderston shaped these elements
he drew on his own adaptation of <i>Dracula</i>

450
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,837
to flesh out the relationships
and evolve the plot.

451
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,629
At one point, he considered requiring
that the mummy, like a vampire,

452
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,792
return regularly
to his coffinlike mummy case

453
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,270
and he argued that the film
should be titled <i>Undead.</i>

454
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:53,673
Ultimately, <i>The Mummy's</i> relationship to
Dracula became less obvious but it exists.

455
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,434
Both films feature an undead being
who, in a sense, seduces the heroine,

456
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,513
threatening her with death
while offering a kind of eternal life,

457
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,070
thereby endangering
both her life and her soul.

458
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,711
In both cases the creature is politely
ironic and exerts hypnotic power.

459
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,871
Combating him are a young man
who loves the heroine

460
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,951
and an older expert in the occult,

461
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:23,319
played in both films by, respectively,
David Manners and Edward Van Sloan.

462
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,837
Each film includes a pivotal scene
in which the expert tests his suspicions

463
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,559
by confronting his opponent
with an object -

464
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,155
a mirror in <i>Dracula</i>
and a photograph in <i>The Mummy</i> - 

465
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,550
which prompts the creature
to drop his pose of civility.

466
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,872
And, in each case, a talisman offers
protection from the creature's power.

467
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,511
A figure of Isis serves this function
in <i>The Mummy,</i> a crucifix in <i>Dracula.</i>

468
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,590
Between this scene and the next,
the shooting script included a scene

469
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,832
of Frank and Helen in his car,
talking outside her hotel.

470
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,310
In it she states that she does not want
to see Imhotep again,

471
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,517
despite what she had said
in his presence earlier.

472
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,513
In the opening shot of Imhotep
at his pool, we see a white cat,

473
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,388
which the screenplay states
is Imhotep's familiar,

474
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,313
which is linked with
the cat goddess, Bast.

475
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,039
The script took pains
to establish the cat's presence

476
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,634
whenever Imhotep is in this setting.

477
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,111
At one point it states that the cat seems
to be taking part in the ceremony,

478
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,113
and during the murder of Whemple
it describes a close-up of the cat

479
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,672
with its "fur erect, paws extended with
claws out, gazing into the pool, spitting".

480
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,314
Most of this was not included in the film.

481
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,794
In developing a script
for what became <i>The Mummy,</i>

482
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,953
Balderston elaborated on the references
to Astro being an Ancient Egyptian

483
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,793
and Professor Whemple
being an archaeologist,

484
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,634
drawing for inspiration on the discovery
of Tutankhamen's tomb.

485
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,838
He himself had, as a journalist,
covered that discovery in the 1920s,

486
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,835
and his final screenplay makes
frequent references to Egyptian artefacts

487
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,390
and to such specific details
as the Semiramis Hotel,

488
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,510
Queen Hatshepsut's Temple, the village
of Kerma and Cairo's street names.

489
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,910
Even the names Imhotep
and Anck-es-en-Amon are authentic,

490
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,595
although they were not
who the film says they were.

491
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,953
Balderston moved the setting of the film's
story from San Francisco to New York

492
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,600
and finally to Cairo.

493
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:15,231
But Egypt and Tutankhamen's tomb
did more than supply an exotic setting.

494
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,759
They led Balderston to provide
the mummy with a curse,

495
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:23,595
which promises death to anyone
who opens the box containing the scroll.

496
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,629
For all its dramatic impact, this curse
is more misleading than meaningful,

497
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:34,716
for by opening the box the archaeologists
help Imhotep by returning him to life.

498
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,796
Once revived he does not seek
to avenge their sacrilege.

499
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,158
In fact, they are useful to him, for they
unearth the mummy of Anck-es-en-Amon.

500
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,475
Whenever Imhotep attacks someone,
such as Whemple,

501
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,836
it is not out of revenge,
or to protect a tomb,

502
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,878
but because that person stands
in the way of his goal

503
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,635
by trying to destroy the scroll
or lure Helen from him.

504
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:03,879
This goal is essential to the film's plot
and its sensitive characterisations.

505
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:09,193
It reverses the main character's negative
motivation in Putnam's original story.

506
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:17,750
Imhotep's romantic situation also evokes
that of Balderston's play <i>Berkeley Square,</i>

507
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,671
in which a contemporary Englishman
finds himself in 18th century London,

508
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,638
where he falls in love
with a woman from the past.

509
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,757
Balderston combined this concept
of love across time

510
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:33,072
with the fact that Anck-es-en-Amon's soul
has been reincarnated in Helen,

511
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:37,870
which creates in her a struggle between
her ancient self and her modern one.

512
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,392
After Frank telephones Helen
and she agrees not to leave her hotel,

513
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,871
there was a substantial amount of footage
eliminated before the film's release.

514
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,636
Out of about 13 pages of the script,
all that remains is a short scene,

515
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,759
one and a half pages long,
in which Muller examines the ashes

516
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,434
and realises they are just newspaper.

517
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:25,354
The cut footage shows Imhotep
at the pool watching Helen at her hotel.

518
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,832
As he concentrates, Helen's dog whines.

519
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,593
She leaves. Frank and Muller,
in Frank's car, talk about Helen.

520
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,471
Meanwhile, Helen arrives at the museum

521
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,870
and examines the display
of Anck-es-en-Amon's personal items.

522
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,158
The jewellery found on her mummy,
pots of ointment, jars of perfume,

523
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,313
and a circular bronze mirror
with its handle in the form of Isis.

524
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,915
At one point, Helen takes out
her own lipstick and powder puff

525
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,118
and adjusts her make-up
using her reflection in the bronze mirror,

526
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,317
an object which the script intends
to reuse later.

527
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,108
Then Imhotep joins Helen
and discusses the objects with her.

528
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,668
His attempt to awaken a memory
of her prior life succeeds,

529
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,438
as she comments "I feel as though
I have seen those things before."

530
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,274
During this section the power
of the Isis amulet is established

531
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,989
when Imhotep turns away in fear
from one that is on display.

532
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,792
Meanwhile, Frank and Muller
arrive at Helen's door.

533
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,236
They hear her dog whining
and find she is gone.

534
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,436
They decide to look
for her at the museum

535
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,752
and at this point Muller finds
that the ashes are of newsprint.

536
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,432
Imhotep tells Helen "You will come
to me tomorrow", then leaves.

537
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,114
Frank and Muller enter
and speak with Helen.

538
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,671
The discarded scenes would have ended
with Imhotep's dusty handprint,

539
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,557
reminding viewers of the final shot
of the opening sequence.

540
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,589
Helen's visit to Imhotep's house
and her scene by his pool

541
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,319
were originally planned
to occur the next day,

542
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,790
but now they immediately follow
Frank's telephone call,

543
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,519
which compresses events effectively.

544
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,558
One certainly would like
to see the missing scene

545
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,200
between Imhotep
and Helen in the museum,

546
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,558
but its elimination was probably wise.

547
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,790
Its dialogue seems unnecessarily blunt

548
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,553
about Helen's feeling
of kinship to Anck-es-en-Amon,

549
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,031
and her encounter with Imhotep there
would certainly have diluted the impact

550
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,112
of the scene in which
she visits him at his house.

551
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,555
The situation involving Helen's dog
at Imhotep's house

552
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,949
is quite a bit clearer in the shooting script,

553
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:49,828
which describes a close-up of this cat
standing with outraged dignity

554
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,993
as it looks at the dog, followed
by a close-up of the dog afraid of the cat.

555
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:58,198
Then, after the dog is taken from the
room, the camera was to pan to the cat,

556
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,271
now sitting with dignity.

557
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,558
Helen reaches over to pet the cat,
but it turns its head away from her.

558
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:42,353
As shot, this scene had Imhotep show
only Anck-es-en-Amon's death,

559
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:47,230
her burial, and his interrupted attempt
to revive her, but no more than that.

560
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,511
Later, during the final sequence at
the museum, Imhotep would use a mirror

561
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:58,669
to reflect images that guide Helen back
through her several prior lives.

562
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,149
In the most recent of these lives,

563
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,518
she rejects a young gallant
in 18th century France.

564
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,559
Moving progressively further back in time,

565
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,269
she bids farewell
to 13th century crusaders,

566
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,636
she commits suicide
in an eighth century Saxon stockade,

567
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,717
and she becomes
a Christian martyr in Ancient Rome.

568
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:25,639
Finally, she sees herself embrace Imhotep
in the sanctuary of Isis,

569
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,474
and only after reaching this point
does Imhotep finally reveal

570
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,472
the events
surrounding his own burial alive.

571
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,028
The scenes depicting Helen's other lives
and identities were filmed,

572
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,476
and several still photos exist
which illustrate them.

573
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:45,792
However, this material truly is extraneous
to the main issue,

574
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,668
which is Imhotep's need
to reclaim Anck-es-en-Amon,

575
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,116
so the footage was dropped,
and appropriately so.

576
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,878
However, Henry Victor, who played
a Saxon warrior in the cut footage,

577
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,511
remains in the cast list included
at the end of the film - an odd oversight.

578
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:07,119
And publicity materials listed
both him and Arnold Gray,

579
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,112
who appeared as a knight
in the cut flashbacks.

580
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:15,276
When these scenes were cut, the footage
depicting Imhotep's fate in Ancient Egypt

581
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,830
was moved to this earlier scene
by the pool

582
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,957
so that the flashback tale
is now told all at once.

583
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,279
This renders the film more compact.

584
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:29,876
It makes Imhotep's statement about his
suffering for her more comprehensible,

585
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:35,034
but it also obscures the meaning of
his line "But the rest you may not know."

586
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:40,035
"Not until you are about to pass through
the great night of terror and triumph."

587
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,278
These changes certainly
streamline the climax,

588
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,909
making it a tight and dramatic
culmination of known factors,

589
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,879
with no new plot elements added
at the last minute to distract.

590
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:01,475
The accurate detail and atmospheric
quality of <i>The Mummy's</i> Egyptian settings

591
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,916
are the contribution
of designer Willy Pogany.

592
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,755
Not a regular Hollywood employee,

593
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:11,196
he also engaged in various
other artistic pursuits,

594
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,477
including theatrical set design,
painting pictures

595
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:18,951
and illustrating children's stories such as
<i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.</i>

596
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,192
In 1931 he had worked on three films
produced by Samuel Goldwyn,

597
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,068
including <i>The Unholy Garden,</i>
which had a desert setting.

598
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,390
But he may have been selected
for <i>The Mummy</i>

599
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:35,077
because of a 1926 Broadway play
he had designed called <i>The Jeweled Tree.</i>

600
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,754
That production took place
in Ancient Egypt

601
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:41,355
and Pogany's sets
were singled out for praise.

602
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,153
After <i>The Mummy</i> he worked on
four musicals released in 1934,

603
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,912
notably <i>Kid Millions,</i>

604
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,710
for which he designed the lavish
Technicolor ice-cream fantasy sequence.

605
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,193
In addition to physical
and emotional suffering,

606
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,034
Karloff's restraint also suggests
Imhotep's unwavering love

607
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,838
for Anck-es-en-Amon,

608
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:15,118
an emotion that so transcends mere
feeling that it has taken possession of him

609
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,998
and become his entire nature.

610
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,629
This was one aspect of the plot
that appealed to John Balderston.

611
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:27,158
As early as April 41932, when he had
just started to work on the project,

612
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,674
he wrote in a studio memo

613
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,070
"Even the mummy is not incapable
of some humanisation."

614
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:37,438
"He can be really affecting when he tells
the girl what a lonely time he has had

615
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:43,277
looking for her through all countries,
all times, all civilisations for 4,000 years."

616
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,514
"There is a love story for you."

617
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:51,712
And he added that the character
will get another moment of sympathy

618
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,519
"when the audience sees his despair"

619
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,876
during the flashback
of Anck-es-en-Amon's burial.

620
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,870
Imhotep's tragedy is not his suffering
at being buried alive,

621
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:11,430
but his isolation,
which is made especially poignant

622
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,069
by the fact that the woman
for whom he sacrificed everything

623
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,755
has been reincarnated
as someone to whom he is a stranger.

624
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:56,991
As Imhotep tells Helen of his austere
passion, his ancient torment,

625
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:01,230
Karloff speaks these lines
in an almost flat tone

626
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,153
that nonetheless captures
the emotion in the words,

627
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:09,473
as well as the rhythmic musicality
of the syllables and of the alliteration.

628
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:13,439
What a pleasure it must have been
to speak such well-phrased dialogue,

629
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,559
especially when it is so attuned to the
way his voice echoes the dry precision

630
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,313
of the desert sands and time itself.

631
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:42,077
When off-screen sounds indicate Helen's
dog has been killed, probably by the cat,

632
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,709
the situation in the release print
is less clear than it might have been

633
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,153
because so many of the references
to the cat have been omitted.

634
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:54,758
In 1931, <i>Dracula</i> had established
a precedent in American horror films

635
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,798
by taking a supernatural
subject seriously.

636
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,590
Another of Balderston's
positive contributions to <i>The Mummy</i>

637
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,877
is the fact that he removed
from Putnam's original story

638
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,509
the pseudoscientific
explanations for events.

639
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:12,673
The nitrates which supposedly
kept Cagliostro alive for centuries

640
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,433
have been replaced
with the Scroll of Thoth,

641
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,034
the reading of which can raise the dead.

642
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:21,715
Thus, the screenplay
totally accepts the efficacy

643
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,268
of Ancient Egypt's religious beliefs,

644
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,955
and most audiences are willing
to go along with that premise.

645
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:31,589
In the process, Astro's
television surveillance system

646
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:36,310
becomes Imhotep's pool,
in which he observes activities elsewhere.

647
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,115
And Astro's death ray has become
the combination of muttered spells

648
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:46,638
and mental power that Imhotep uses
to kill Whemple, and later to attack Frank.

649
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:52,396
All of these mystical elements somehow
come across on film as more convincing

650
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,268
than the far-fetched
pseudoscientific aspects would have.

651
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,909
A related influence on the final screenplay

652
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,755
derives at least partly from the fact that
after Balderston began work on this film

653
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,673
he received a second assignment
from Universal -

654
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:14,799
to adapt H Rider Haggard's
1887 fantasy novel, <i>She.</i>

655
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,639
In working on both projects
simultaneously,

656
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:23,032
he submitted a 33-page treatment
of <i>She</i> on July 17,

657
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:26,954
just four days after completing
his second <i>Mummy</i> script.

658
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,430
A second treatment
of <i>She</i> followed on August 2nd.

659
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,715
After that,
he concentrated on <i>The Mummy</i>

660
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:37,112
and did not complete
a screenplay of <i>She</i> until October 17,

661
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,839
while <i>The Mummy</i> was in production.

662
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,117
Universal probably didn't produce <i>She</i>
because of its budget,

663
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,111
but the studio may also have realised

664
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,953
that <i>The Mummy</i> included
enough elements from <i>She</i>

665
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:52,158
that a resemblance between the two
might have been evident.

666
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:58,509
Finally, on May 311934,
Universal sold its rights to <i>She</i> to RKO

667
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:03,196
and transferred to that studio
Balderston's treatments and screenplay.

668
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:08,798
Merian C Cooper's 1935 RKO film of <i>She</i>
does not credit Balderston,

669
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,351
but some of its dialogue echoes <i>The</i>
<i>Mummy's</i> and may derive from his work.

670
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:18,995
Both <i>She</i> and <i>The Mummy</i> juxtapose
an ancient romance with a modern one.

671
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,598
In both, one person survives from the past

672
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,672
and the other is reincarnated
in a new body.

673
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:30,550
In <i>She,</i> Kallikrates,
a priest of Isis, committed sacrilege

674
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,234
by loving the Princess Amenartas.

675
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:37,279
After the two flee from Egypt,
they cross paths with Ayesha,

676
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,234
who falls in love with the priest.

677
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:44,393
But, because he loves another,
she kills him in jealous anger.

678
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:50,157
Because Ayesha gains immortality by
bathing in a magical flame, she lives on,

679
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,754
awaiting the return of her beloved.

680
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:57,630
And return he does, 2,000 years later,
in the form of Leo Vincey,

681
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:02,077
the descendant and, in a sense,
the reincarnation of Kallikrates.

682
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,390
By blending Amenartas and Ayesha
into a single character,

683
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,789
and reversing the lovers' sexes,

684
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,838
<i>The Mummy</i> turns this situation
into the forbidden love

685
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,832
of Imhotep and Princess
Anck-es-en-Amon,

686
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,435
a priestess of Isis
who broke her vows as a vestal virgin.

687
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,754
Before Ayesha can be reunited
with her reincarnated love

688
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,992
he must die and be reborn,
thus becoming immortal like her.

689
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:34,878
As a first step, she destroys
the original lover's preserved body.

690
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:40,076
Similarly, Imhotep must kill Helen,
mummify her body

691
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,391
and then use the scroll
to revive it to eternal life.

692
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,879
First, he burns
Anck-es-en-Amon's mummy.

693
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,074
In another link
between <i>The Mummy</i> and <i>She,</i>

694
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,276
both Imhotep and Ayesha reveal
to others images of the past

695
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,920
in the surface of a pool of water.

696
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,790
Ayesha and Imhotep share a mixture
of malevolence and suffering.

697
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,394
Each is, in Haggard's words,

698
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,790
"a being who,
unconstrained by human law,

699
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,078
is also absolutely unshackled
by a moral sense of right and wrong."

700
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:22,235
Both are passionately devoted
to satisfying the long-denied need

701
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,880
to be with their beloveds.

702
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,793
In <i>She,</i> a native girl falls in love with Leo,

703
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:33,271
so Ayesha kills her rival
with the power of her eyes and her will.

704
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:39,037
Both Ayesha's method, and her casual
ruthlessness, are transferred to Imhotep,

705
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:43,236
who tries to destroy Frank Whemple
for the same reason.

706
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:48,149
In the 1935 film <i>She,</i>
a character based on the native girl

707
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,592
tells Ayesha
that she has a stronger hold on Leo

708
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,593
"because I'm young,
and you know love belongs to the young".

709
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:03,357
"You were young once, but now you're
old and it's too late for love for ever."

710
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,592
This character sounds
very much like Helen Grosvenor,

711
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:12,151
who, speaking as Anck-es-en-Amon
in <i>The Mummy's</i> climax, tells Imhotep

712
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:17,396
"I'm alive. I'm young. I loved you once,
but now you belong with the dead."

713
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:20,836
"I want to live,
even in this strange new world."

714
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,233
This material,
seemingly derived from <i>She,</i>

715
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:28,108
helps give <i>The Mummy</i> the emotional
substance and dramatic power

716
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,158
that cannot be glimpsed
in <i>Cagliostro's</i> plot.

717
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:36,150
<i>The Mummy's</i> screenplay
was so carefully preplanned,

718
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,231
and so faithfully followed,

719
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:43,838
that in only one major instance was its
structure altered before shooting began.

720
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,118
In the original plan, the scene
of Imhotep's attack on Frank occurred

721
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:52,318
almost immediately after she returns
from visiting Imhotep.

722
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,078
Before filming, that scene was rewritten
and moved to this spot,

723
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:02,919
just before the film's climax, where
it certainly has greater dramatic impact.

724
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:07,428
At the same time, the character
of Frau Muller was replaced

725
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,239
with that of the nurse who tends Helen.

726
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:14,632
The first version of the scene
did not involve Helen leaving her room.

727
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:15,359
After three shots that concisely
summarise the museum break-in...

728
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,554
we discover Imhotep with Helen,

729
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,552
who already wears
Ancient Egyptian costume

730
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:32,677
and is talking with Imhotep
as Anck-es-en-Amon.

731
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:36,950
The shooting script led up
to this moment much more gradually.

732
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,953
It describes the camera moving
with a watchman as he walks outside,

733
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,600
then it moves to the window
with its bars bent

734
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:48,595
and on to some shrubbery and trees, from
behind which Imhotep and Helen emerge.

735
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:55,073
The Nubian servant, already within, starts
to help Helen enter through the window.

736
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:59,676
Inside, Imhotep confronts a guard
who collapses from his stare.

737
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,712
An antique oil lamp
is obtained from a display

738
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,917
and the Nubian
hands Helen clothing to put on.

739
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,152
A necklace and bracelets are taken
from other cases for Helen to wear.

740
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:16,314
Finally, Imhotep takes the bronze mirror,
has Helen gaze into it,

741
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:20,757
and through it reflects her stages
of reincarnation and the rest of the events,

742
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:24,958
which in the release print
already were shown in the pool scene.

743
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,872
In the release print,
we join Helen and Imhotep

744
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,633
just after the end of the flashbacks

745
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:36,748
as she says "No man has ever suffered
for woman as you've suffered for me."

746
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:52,714
A key figure in the success of <i>The</i>
<i>Mummy</i> must be its director, Karl Freund.

747
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:59,232
However, any attempt to specify Freund's
contribution requires some speculation

748
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:02,790
because the shooting script -
credited solely to Balderston -

749
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:07,271
includes detailed descriptions
of editing and camera movements.

750
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:11,797
Indeed, though some changes were made
on the set and during postproduction,

751
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:16,078
all of the major creative decisions
are represented in the script.

752
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:21,396
Thus, the director had no major artistic
problems to solve while shooting.

753
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:24,837
He merely executed
the already-refined plans.

754
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:30,196
For example, the script's description
of the mummy's return to life

755
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,919
includes all of the subtle
camera movements

756
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,629
and the decision not to show
the mummy move through the room.

757
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:41,157
Everything of significance in this scene
already existed in the screenplay.

758
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:44,198
However, it is hard
to imagine that Balderston,

759
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:49,513
a first-time screenwriter, possessed
such a refined cinematic sense

760
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:53,115
that all Freund had to do
was follow his instructions.

761
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:57,432
If so, Balderston surely would
have been in greater demand.

762
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:02,116
But aside from the 1933 adaptation
of his own play, <i>Berkeley Square,</i>

763
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:06,079
he did not receive another screen credit
until three years after <i>The Mummy,</i>

764
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,276
and of his 19 screen credits,

765
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:12,239
all but <i>The Mummy</i> and one other
were written in collaboration.

766
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:17,589
It also is hard to imagine that Karl Freund,
in his directorial debut,

767
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,752
would have deferred
so completely to a novice.

768
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,956
In Germany during the 1920s,

769
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:26,794
this eminent cinematographer
had been a major artistic collaborator

770
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,350
on ten films directed
by the renowned FW Murnau,

771
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:35,192
as well as on Paul Wegener's
<i>The Golem</i> in 1920,

772
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:41,150
and Fritz Lang's <i>Metropolis</i> in 1927.
He also had helped to write and shoot

773
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:45,950
the 1926 documentary, <i>Berlin:</i>
<i>The Symphony of a Great City,</i>

774
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:49,635
and had supervised
the direction of a 1926 feature,

775
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:52,757
<i>The Adventures of a Ten Mark Note.</i>

776
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:57,868
After coming to the United States in 1929,
Freund devised the poetic ending

777
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:02,078
of Universal's <i>All Quiet</i>
<i>on the Western Front</i> in 1930

778
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,551
and reportedly had substantial influence
on Tod Browning's <i>Dracula.</i>

779
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,355
Freund was a filmmaker,
not a photographic technician.

780
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:18,072
Could Freund have had input while
Balderston was writing <i>The Mummy?</i>

781
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:22,915
On August 29, 1932, Universal
announced Freund's assignment

782
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,912
to direct what was then called <i>Imhotep,</i>

783
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,118
one week before Balderston completed
his sixth screenplay,

784
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:35,149
two weeks before the shooting script,
and about 21 days before shooting began.

785
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:42,799
Freund had completed photographing
Universal's <i>Afraid to Talk</i> in early August,

786
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:46,475
so for about one month
he was free to help develop the script.

787
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:50,074
Without further evidence
one cannot be certain

788
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:53,277
of the nature or extent
of Freund's contributions.

789
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:57,148
However, it is more reasonable
to assume that he participated

790
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:00,755
than to assume that he patiently waited
for the finished script

791
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:03,593
and then modestly shot it as written.

792
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:08,231
Certainly, Freund did develop a close
working relationship with Balderston,

793
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:12,393
for on <i>The Mummy</i> he instituted
a new system for Universal,

794
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:17,600
one in which he, as director, could call on
the writer to assist in script revision.

795
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:22,630
<i>The Mummy's</i> use of moving camera
and the slow pace that results

796
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,551
link the film's visual style

797
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:28,235
to Freund's background
in the German film industry of the 1920s,

798
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:31,869
which lingered on images
to create what is known as <i>Stimmung,</i>

799
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:34,554
a sense of the psychological
or emotional atmosphere

800
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,837
that hovers in the space
around people and objects.

801
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:42,758
To a viewer whose sensibility is confined
to the physical and tangible,

802
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:47,868
a German filmmaker's willingness
to devote time to creating <i>Stimmung</i>

803
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,633
will seem like an intolerably slow pace,

804
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:54,839
for action becomes secondary
to the imprecise and the unstated.

805
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:59,874
In addition to such subtle overtones,
one may surely credit to Freund

806
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:03,635
the dramatic impact of placing the Nubian
and his vat of embalming fluid

807
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,790
large in the foreground of one shot,

808
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,031
and to have his shadow
cast on the wall near Helen

809
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:12,556
as an almost spectral embodiment
of her imminent fate.

810
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:24,754
Intercutting in the film's climax
suggests a traditional last-minute rescue.

811
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:30,509
But in fact, Freund is more interested
in helplessness than rescue,

812
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,830
as revealed by the contrast between

813
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:38,199
the carefully chosen intense shots
of Imhotep and his preparations,

814
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:41,352
which are much more varied
and impressive

815
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:45,558
than the nondescript long shots
of Frank and Muller on their way.

816
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:42,912
Also, the alternation back and forth
feels half-hearted,

817
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,310
almost a token gesture
toward building suspense.

818
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,674
Appropriately, although
the heroes do arrive in time,

819
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:23,118
they are unable to save Helen because
Imhotep easily renders them powerless.

820
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:38,237
Helen, still possessed by the identity of
Anck-es-en-Amon, prays to Isis for help,

821
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,479
using the language of Ancient Egypt.

822
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:46,793
The statue's arm moves, the scroll burns,
and Imhotep disintegrates.

823
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,709
Karl Freund would direct
a few more films, generally minor,

824
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,598
but his directorial career ended
on a very strong note

825
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:08,231
with the outstanding <i>Mad Love,</i>
made for MGM in 1935.

826
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:12,438
At its release, <i>The Mummy</i> was met
with generally dismissive reviews

827
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,512
and only a lukewarm reception
at the box office.

828
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,114
Nonetheless, it has survived through time

829
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:21,636
and can be seen now as a subtle
and austerely passionate story

830
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:24,314
of love and pain and dread -

831
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:29,110
one that makes graceful, even elegant use
of the motion-picture medium.

832
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:32,510
If any one actor and character and film

833
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:36,195
can embody the exotic
yet accessible satisfactions

834
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:38,510
of the classic American horror film,

835
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:42,912
then that actor is Boris Karloff
and that character is Imhotep

836
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,673
and that film is <i>The Mummy.</i>

837
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:46,749
This is Paul Jensen.
