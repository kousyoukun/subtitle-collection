1
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:15,928
Trying to teach me
a lesson in patience, Sir Joseph?

2
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,138
Method is everything in archaeology.

3
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,724
We always deal with
our finds of the day in order.

4
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,644
Well, it seems to me
that that box we dug up today,

5
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:26,396
with the very peculiar
gentleman over there,

6
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,774
is the only find we've made in two months

7
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:32,152
that'll bring this expedition
medals from the British Museum.

8
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:35,322
We didn't come
to dig in Egypt for medals.

9
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,991
Much more is learned
from bits of broken pottery

10
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,410
than from all the sensational finds.

11
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,747
Our job is to increase
the sum of human knowledge of the past,

12
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,791
not to satisfy our own curiosity.

13
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,920
Oh, that's all very true, Sir Joseph,
but, after all, we're human.

14
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,340
- And a find like this! How can you wait?
- This is your first trip.

15
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,927
I've been here ten years. I'm more
curious about the mummy than you.

16
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,179
And even more about that box.

17
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,098
- Whemple.
- Yes?

18
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,308
The viscera were not removed.

19
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:06,645
The usual scar made
by the embalmer's knife is not there.

20
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,313
I guessed as much, Muller.

21
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,822
I had a good look at him
when I photographed him.

22
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,241
Never saw a mummy like that.

23
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,827
Neither, I imagine, has anyone else.

24
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,498
Looks as though he died in some
sensationally unpleasant manner.

25
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:32,462
The contorted muscles show
that he struggled in the bandages.

26
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,631
Buried alive?

27
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,970
"Imhotep".

28
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:44,725
"High Priest of
the Temple of the Sun at Karnak".

29
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:50,022
Poor old fella. Now, what could you have
done to make 'em treat you like that?

30
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,524
An execution for treason, I suppose.

31
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,944
Sacrilege, more likely.

32
00:03:56,028 --> 00:04:01,241
Look. Sacred spells which protect
the soul in its journey to the underworld

33
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,619
have been chipped off the coffin.

34
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:08,081
So Imhotep was sentenced to death
not only in this world, but in the next.

35
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:11,752
Maybe he got too gay
with the vestal virgins in the temple.

36
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:16,507
Possibly. The priestesses of the Temple
of Karnak were daughters of the Pharaoh.

37
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,675
They were the secret virgins of Isis.

38
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:22,179
Maybe the answer's
in that box we found buried with him.

39
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,599
I see I shall get no more work
out of you until after it's open.

40
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:29,311
- Come on.
- Let's have the box.

41
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,441
Oh dear. The wood's so rotten
it'll fall apart at a touch.

42
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,319
Whatever it is, it's terribly heavy.

43
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,539
Metal. Looks like copper.

44
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:58,340
It's gold.

45
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,511
I say. Look here.

46
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,515
The unbroken seals
of the Pharaoh Amenophis.

47
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,101
Some temple treasure.

48
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:42,176
"Death, eternal punishment, for...
anyone... who... opens... this... casket."

49
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:47,681
"In the name of Amon-Ra,
the king of the gods."

50
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,727
Good heavens, what a terrible curse!

51
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:55,105
- Well, let's see what's inside!
- Wait!

52
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,858
You will break the curse.

53
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:01,695
We recognise your mastery
of the occult sciences, Muller.

54
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,281
But your beliefs can't
interfere with my work.

55
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,993
- Then why did you send for me today?
- As a friend and an expert.

56
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,787
This find was unique
and I wanted your opinion.

57
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,665
- It's providential that you did.
- Oh, come, Dr Muller.

58
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:17,711
Surely a few thousand years in the earth
take the mumbo jumbo off any old curse.

59
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,796
Oh, I cannot speak before a boy.

60
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,799
Come out under the stars of Egypt.

61
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,929
Do not touch that casket.

62
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,353
Go on with your cataloguing.
We'll open it later.

63
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,855
Don't think you can
persuade me not to examine

64
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:40,651
the most wonderful find
of my whole experience out here.

65
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:55,499
If you are right about the legend, then this
casket may contain the Scroll of Thoth,

66
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:59,586
from the holy of holies in the temple, and
I can hardly wait to get back to find out.

67
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:03,590
The gods of Egypt still live in these hills,
in their ruined temples.

68
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:07,010
The ancient spells are weaker,
but some of them are still potent.

69
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:10,514
And I believe that you have
in your hut the Scroll of Thoth itself,

70
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:14,434
which contains the great spell with which
Isis raised Osiris from the dead.

71
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,898
Put it back. Bury it where you found it.

72
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:28,110
You have read the curse.
You dare defy it?

73
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,864
In the interests of science,
even if I believed in the curse,

74
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,241
I'd go on with my work for the museum.

75
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,744
Come back with me and we'll
examine this great find together.

76
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,540
I cannot condone
an act of sacrilege with my presence.

77
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:42,661
What's the matter, man?
For heaven's sakes, what is it?

78
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,498
He... He went for a little walk!

79
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,918
You should have seen his face!

80
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:45,140
Here's something to break the monotony.
A visitor coming from the Nile.

81
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:48,560
- Colour? Nationality?
- How could I see in that glare?

82
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,979
Well, Whemple, back we go to London.

83
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:56,276
And what fools we look. Money wasted.
Hole after hole dug in this blasted desert.

84
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:58,987
A few beads. A few broken pots.

85
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:01,990
A man needs more
than hard work for this game.

86
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:05,577
He needs flair.
He needs luck. Like your father.

87
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:08,497
When he came here,
there wasn't so much competition.

88
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:14,545
When he did, he found things. And once,
ten years ago, he found too much.

89
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:19,758
Was it ten years? Queer story, that young
Oxford chap he had with him going mad.

90
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,927
- You know what I think it was?
- No. What?

91
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:26,640
He went crazy. Bored beyond human
endurance in this sand and these rocks.

92
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:31,854
He was laughing when your father found
him. He died laughing, in a straitjacket.

93
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,939
Your father never explained.

94
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:38,652
But when the best excavator England
has turned out, a man who loved Egypt,

95
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:42,114
said he'd never come back here,
that meant something.

96
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,122
Come in.

97
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:02,342
You break your season's camp,
Professor Pearson?

98
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:04,928
Your colleagues
have returned to London?

99
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:08,682
Yes. Whemple and I
stayed behind to clear up.

100
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,560
Your expedition has not been a success.

101
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:15,647
Scarcely.
Here are the season's finds.

102
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:19,818
Permit me to present you
with the most sensational find

103
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:22,237
since that of Tutankhamen.

104
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:24,948
This is very sporting of you!
May I ask why?

105
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:29,828
We Egyptians are not permitted
to dig up our ancient dead.

106
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:32,831
Only... foreign museums.

107
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:35,709
What's this?

108
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:39,922
Part of the funerary equipment
of the princess Anck-es-en-Amon.

109
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:44,801
- Daughter of Amenophis the Magnificent.
- Yes. It's her name.

110
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:49,056
I found that not 100 yards
from where we are.

111
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:53,268
- You mean you think her tomb is there?
- I will show you where to dig.

112
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,982
I'm sure it's very good of you, Mr...?
I didn't catch your name.

113
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,151
Ardath Bey.

114
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:21,463
Circumstantial evidence.
Not very strong, perhaps.

115
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:24,550
But if we put that gang
of diggers from Kerma on the job,

116
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:27,511
we can tell in two days
if there's anything here.

117
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,429
In one day, Professor.

118
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:15,225
- It's a step.
- He was right.

119
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,394
Anyhow, we've found something.

120
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:45,923
- The name of Anck-es-en-Amon.
- We will cable your father in London.

121
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,884
He must be here when
we examine this great find.

122
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,224
The seal of the seven jackals.

123
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:58,435
And it's unbroken.

124
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:03,440
No one has entered this door since
the priests of the royal acropolis sealed it.

125
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,653
3700 years ago.

126
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:53,258
Is there a view like this
in all the world, Helen?

127
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:55,427
The real Egypt.

128
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:03,977
Are we really in
this dreadful modern Cairo?

129
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:08,273
Your thoughts are far from the dance
and these nice English boys.

130
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:10,901
Not really. I'm having a lovely time.

131
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,111
- I'm so grateful.
- But why?

132
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:15,322
Your keeping me here with you,
of course.

133
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:19,159
So I don't have to go up to Father
in that beastly hot Sudan.

134
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:22,955
It's I who am grateful.
My most interesting patient.

135
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:31,338
Know who that is?

136
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,466
- Muller of Vienna.
- Really?

137
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:38,720
Always spends his winters here.
Authority on Egyptian occult.

138
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:41,056
- Yes, but the girl?
- Helen Grosvenor.

139
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:45,394
Her father's governor of the Sudan.
English, of course. Her mother, Egyptian.

140
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:49,648
Some old family with a tree a mile long.
She's staying here with Dr and Mrs Muller.

141
00:20:03,162 --> 00:20:05,747
Pardon me, sir. Our closing bell has rung.

142
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:07,708
I did not notice the time.

143
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:12,212
- I am addressing Sir Joseph Whemple?
- Yes.

144
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:16,049
- I am Ardath Bey.
- Indeed!

145
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:22,598
Why, we have you to thank
that we have this exhibit here at all.

146
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:25,893
The museum should be kept open
all night in your honour.

147
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:29,730
Won't you come down to my office?
I'm working here late.

148
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:32,065
Your pardon. I dislike to be touched.

149
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:34,860
An Eastern prejudice.

150
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:45,829
Won't you sit down?

151
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,501
You know my son?

152
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:57,132
Ardath Bey. Where did you disappear
to when we opened the tomb?

153
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:59,801
I returned to Cairo.

154
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:03,222
But... but now I must not detain you.

155
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:06,767
But I must see you again.
You must come to my house.

156
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,437
I regret I am too occupied
to accept invitations.

157
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,405
He's a strange one.

158
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:24,409
You might have thanked him. He was
responsible for finding the princess.

159
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:26,495
Yes. I rather wish he hadn't been.

160
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:29,623
It's a dirty trick,
Cairo Museum keeping what we've found.

161
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:34,670
That was the contract. The British
Museum works for science, not for loot.

162
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,629
Anck-es-en-Amon.

163
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:20,757
Anck-es-en-Amon.

164
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:22,926
Anck-es-en-Amon.

165
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:27,222
Is anything the matter?

166
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:33,854
Anck-es-en-Amon.

167
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,665
Anck-es-en-Amon.

168
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,653
Where do you want to go, miss?

169
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:25,489
Le musée des Antiquités.

170
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:28,116
Le musée des Antiquités.

171
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,206
Imhotep.

172
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:37,292
Anck-es-en-Amon.

173
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:39,545
Anck-es-en-Amon.

174
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:42,214
Imhotep.

175
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:46,635
Imhotep.

176
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:17,499
I must get in.

177
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,501
Anck-es-en-Amon.

178
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:22,546
- I must!
- It's closed for the night. They've gone.

179
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:24,715
I must get in.

180
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:49,156
Imhotep. Imhotep.

181
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:56,622
Imhotep.

182
00:24:57,456 --> 00:25:02,002
What's she saying?

183
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:04,796
What language is that?

184
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:10,135
The language of ancient Egypt.
Not heard on this earth for 2000 years.

185
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:17,309
And the name of a man unspoken
since before the siege of Troy.

186
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:05,983
- Is your master at home?
- Yes, sir.

187
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:08,902
Tell him Dr Muller wishes
to see him urgently.

188
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:19,913
- How did I get here?
- We brought you here. Father and I.

189
00:26:19,997 --> 00:26:22,082
You fainted.

190
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:28,589
But how did you guess she was here?

191
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:32,217
I discovered that she took a taxi
from the hotel to the museum.

192
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:35,762
I went there. The watchman said
she had left in your car.

193
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:42,853
Before you take her away, I must talk
to you about something she said just now.

194
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:53,780
- Oh, Dr Muller.
- Oh, here you are, my dear.

195
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,201
I suppose you introduced yourself?

196
00:26:57,284 --> 00:27:03,165
No? Miss Helen Grosvenor, my old friend
Sir Joseph Whemple, Frank Whemple.

197
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:06,460
That seems so formal under
these peculiar circumstances.

198
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:09,838
And now, if you're all right again,
back we go to the hotel.

199
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:12,799
I think she'll want to rest a few minutes.

200
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:19,306
Frank, will you make yourself agreeable?

201
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:26,313
Well...

202
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:29,149
Where was I when I fainted, Mr Whemple?

203
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:33,904
- Oh, outside the museum.
- What was I doing there?

204
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:37,449
Well, I wouldn't know that, would I?

205
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:41,954
No, I don't suppose you would.
I wish I did.

206
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:44,122
- I was waiting...
- Let's not talk about it.

207
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:46,291
Oh, right.

208
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:55,050
- You're partly Egyptian, aren't you?
- Yes.

209
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:57,219
How did you guess that?

210
00:27:57,928 --> 00:28:01,640
Well, I don't know.
Just something about you.

211
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:05,477
I'd have liked Egypt better
if I'd met you there.

212
00:28:05,561 --> 00:28:09,898
No such luck! Stuck in the desert
for two months, and was it hot!

213
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:12,150
- That tomb.
- What tomb?

214
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:16,113
Surely you read about the princess?

215
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,198
- So you did that?
- Yes.

216
00:28:18,282 --> 00:28:21,243
The 14 steps down
and the unbroken seals were thrilling.

217
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:25,747
But when we came to handle all her
clothes, her jewels and her toilet things...

218
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:28,500
They buried everything
with them they used in life.

219
00:28:28,584 --> 00:28:32,713
- When we came to unwrap the girl...
- How could you do that?

220
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:35,340
Had to! Science, you know!

221
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:39,636
Well, after we'd worked among her things,
I felt as if I'd known her.

222
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:44,308
But when we got the wrappings off,
and I saw her face...

223
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:47,936
You'll think me silly,
but I sort of fell in love with her.

224
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:52,816
Do you have to open graves
to find giris to fall in love with?

225
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:59,823
I say. Now I know what it is about you.

226
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:04,745
There was something about her head...

227
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:08,248
I had never mentioned the name,
yet I heard Miss Grosvenor

228
00:29:08,332 --> 00:29:11,710
mutter in ancient Egyptian
something about Imhotep.

229
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:13,879
Imhotep?

230
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:20,469
What was this Ardath
doing in the museum?

231
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:24,681
Looking at the mummy.
Just at closing time.

232
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,937
Hello?

233
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,105
What?

234
00:29:33,065 --> 00:29:35,150
Il est mort?

235
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,946
Tout de suite, effendi.

236
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:44,034
Come. A museum guard found dead
in the room with the princess.

237
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:58,590
Fear. Fear.

238
00:29:58,674 --> 00:30:00,926
So he died of shock.

239
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:03,595
We find this in dead guard's hand,
Sir Joseph.

240
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,975
Probably thief tried to steal it.
Guard take it away, thief kill him.

241
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:12,062
The cause of death, I not find nothing.

242
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:16,567
Looks like an attempted theft, but
nothing stolen here could be sold.

243
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,735
What is the document?

244
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:43,802
Let me put this here.
You'll be more comfortable.

245
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:46,346
Thanks.

246
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:50,434
You really want to know why
I didn't take you to the hospital?

247
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:54,813
- Because, when I held you in my arms...
- Hadn't you better not commit yourself?

248
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:58,984
What girl could not make a conquest who
collapsed at a man's feet in moonlight?

249
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:04,031
It seems absurd when we've known each
other such a short time, but I'm serious.

250
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:06,492
Haven't I had enough
excitement for one evening,

251
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:10,037
without the additional thrill
of a strange man making love to me?

252
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,457
But I've never been serious
about this sort of thing before.

253
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:18,587
Now, look here. You can tell me to go
to the devil, but you can't laugh at me.

254
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:29,681
The curse has struck her, and now,
through her, it will strike my son.

255
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:31,558
Quiet.

256
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:35,270
Frank, will you come
to your father's study?

257
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:38,148
Helen, I shall take you home presently.

258
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,196
I'll be back in a minute.

259
00:31:55,165 --> 00:31:58,168
Imhotep was alive
when that mummy in the museum

260
00:31:58,252 --> 00:32:00,128
was a vestal virgin in the temple.

261
00:32:00,212 --> 00:32:03,507
3700 years ago!
What's that got to do with us now?

262
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,926
Your assistant who went insane and died,

263
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:08,303
as you might have
if you'd seen what he saw,

264
00:32:08,387 --> 00:32:11,306
made a transcription of part of that scroll.

265
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,226
Yes. I have it still.

266
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:19,064
You seem to think it has all the devils of
hell in it. Burn it and be done with it.

267
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:21,233
An excellent suggestion.

268
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:24,194
What became of the mummy of Imhotep?

269
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,865
Somebody stole it!

270
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:31,535
Look, what's the matter
with Miss Grosvenor?

271
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:35,038
You still think that
that mummy was stolen, Sir Joseph?

272
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:40,878
Yes. I...
I really don't know.

273
00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:03,544
A thousand pardons. I am Ardath Bey.

274
00:34:07,673 --> 00:34:09,758
I am Helen Grosvenor.

275
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:12,970
I called to see Sir Joseph.

276
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:18,267
- He's in the study.
- In conference?

277
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,435
If I might perhaps wait?

278
00:34:21,812 --> 00:34:24,439
Yes. Of course.

279
00:34:30,696 --> 00:34:33,949
Have we not met before, Miss Grosvenor?

280
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:37,494
No. I don't think so.

281
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:42,958
I don't think one would forget
meeting you, Ardath Bey.

282
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:45,127
Then I am mistaken.

283
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:48,755
But you are of our blood.

284
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:50,924
As to that, I am not mistaken.

285
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:56,555
Yes. My mother was Egyptian.

286
00:34:56,805 --> 00:34:59,308
You must burn the Scroll of Thoth!

287
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:03,103
I tell you,
it's the museum's property, not mine.

288
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:05,439
Who's out there with Miss Grosvenor?

289
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:12,738
Ardath Bey!

290
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:14,907
He's come for the scroll.

291
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:40,015
Ardath Bey, Dr Muller.

292
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:47,689
I accept your invitation. But I find
no solitary student with his books.

293
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:49,858
I fear my visit is inopportune.

294
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:53,111
On the contrary.
We were just talking about...

295
00:35:53,195 --> 00:35:55,322
- Me?
- Your native Egypt.

296
00:35:56,365 --> 00:35:58,992
You know Miss Grosvenor?

297
00:35:59,076 --> 00:36:01,745
Ardath Bey introduced himself.

298
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:05,707
Won't you be seated?

299
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,391
Sir Joseph was just
wondering how you knew

300
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:25,561
where the tomb of the princess
Anck-es-en-Amon was hidden.

301
00:36:25,644 --> 00:36:28,814
Partly inference, partly chance.

302
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:33,402
Sir Joseph, you seem disturbed.

303
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:38,782
Yes. A tragedy at the museum
after you left.

304
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:42,494
Tragedy?

305
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:44,663
When I was there...

306
00:36:45,455 --> 00:36:47,791
When you were there, Miss Grosvenor?

307
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:53,630
Yes. They told me I went there
and tried to get in after it was closed.

308
00:36:53,714 --> 00:36:55,966
I don't remember, but...

309
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:58,135
Helen, it is very late.

310
00:36:58,844 --> 00:37:01,555
Frank, will you please
see Helen back to the hotel?

311
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:05,517
- Certainly, if Miss Grosvenor will let me.
- I don't want to go.

312
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:09,313
After what happened, you need rest badly.

313
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:15,319
But I don't. I was tired, but...

314
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:17,446
Why, I've never felt so alive before!

315
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:20,532
- As your doctor, I must order you to go.
- I'm not a child.

316
00:37:20,616 --> 00:37:22,701
Yes, please come.

317
00:37:25,496 --> 00:37:27,915
Then, Ardath Bey, au revoir.

318
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:30,083
We must see each other again.

319
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:33,670
I shall be honoured.

320
00:37:52,648 --> 00:37:57,986
An unusual crime. A guard killed
by a man who left a gift to the museum.

321
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:00,155
- A gift?
- A scroll.

322
00:38:00,823 --> 00:38:04,076
Part of which was transcribed
when it was first found.

323
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:06,286
Here is the transcription.

324
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,960
I cannot read the writing
of a period so remote.

325
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:16,088
But you read "Anck-es-en-Amon"
on that piece of pottery.

326
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:18,257
That was of the 18th dynasty.

327
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,968
These are pre-dynastic ideographs.

328
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:24,471
The scroll from which this
was copied was stolen ten years ago,

329
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:27,683
together with the mummy
of the high priest Imhotep.

330
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:30,018
Most interesting.

331
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:33,188
May I see that scroll, Sir Joseph?

332
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:36,775
We left it at the... museum.

333
00:38:37,025 --> 00:38:40,070
- So.
- I have something else to show you.

334
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:43,073
A photograph.

335
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:49,288
Why do you show all this to me?

336
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:53,542
Do you think it conceivable
that the mummy was not stolen,

337
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:56,712
but given a semblance
of life by the spell of the scroll?

338
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:59,882
That scroll is my property.
I bought it from a dealer.

339
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:04,011
It is here in this house.
I presume, in that room.

340
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:11,810
We had foreseen this.

341
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:14,021
The scroll is in safe hands.

342
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:18,984
It will be destroyed the minute
it is known that harm has come to us.

343
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:23,447
You have studied our ancient arts,
and you know that you cannot harm me.

344
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:27,117
You also know that you must
return that scroll to me or die.

345
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,414
Now tell that weak fool
to get that scroll, wherever it is,

346
00:39:32,498 --> 00:39:35,751
and hand it to his Nubian servant.

347
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,463
- The Nubian!
- The ancient blood.

348
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:43,884
So you have made him your slave.

349
00:39:45,594 --> 00:39:52,851
If I could get my hands on you,
I'd break your dried flesh to pieces.

350
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:57,814
But your power is too strong.

351
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:16,959
This is the evil force
that has been attacking her.

352
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:19,962
Burn the scroll, man. Burn it!

353
00:40:20,045 --> 00:40:23,298
It was through you
this horror came into existence.

354
00:40:23,382 --> 00:40:26,927
It's true. It's true.

355
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:34,096
Your father destroyed the scroll,
knowing that it would cost him his life.

356
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:39,560
What's that?

357
00:42:39,643 --> 00:42:45,566
Isis. The Egyptian symbol of life.
I meant it for your father.

358
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:48,360
What good could
that old charm have done him?

359
00:42:50,362 --> 00:42:53,282
I tell you, the doctors say
it's plainly heart failure.

360
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:55,367
The Nubian is missing.

361
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:58,412
He's an old servant. He's frightened.

362
00:42:58,495 --> 00:43:00,581
He'll be back.

363
00:43:01,498 --> 00:43:05,502
Don't try and make me believe that this
Ardath fellow is a mummy come to life.

364
00:43:05,586 --> 00:43:08,172
That idea, and the horror of it,
killed my father.

365
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:11,925
The museum guard
died of natural causes, too.

366
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:14,261
Frank, I need your help.

367
00:43:14,344 --> 00:43:18,223
I saw your attraction
to my patient last night, and hers to you.

368
00:43:19,558 --> 00:43:23,103
- Hers to me? Do you really think so?
- And I welcomed it.

369
00:43:23,187 --> 00:43:27,149
But do you think I have a chance?
Cos I think she's the most won...

370
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:32,946
- Oh, but this is terrible at a time like this...
- Frank, I'm afraid.

371
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:37,826
- Will you go with me to her now?
- Yes.

372
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:41,580
Then telephone her first,
not to leave the hotel.

373
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:56,386
9590.

374
00:43:58,305 --> 00:44:00,390
No. I'm not going out.

375
00:44:02,226 --> 00:44:05,646
Yes. I promise to wait until you get here.

376
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:10,984
Goodbye. And I'm so dreadfully sorry.

377
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,722
What were you doing, Doctor?

378
00:44:40,806 --> 00:44:43,600
Your father did not burn
the Scroll of Thoth.

379
00:44:43,684 --> 00:44:46,144
That creature has it now.

380
00:44:46,228 --> 00:44:49,106
- The ashes in the fireplace!
- They were newspaper.

381
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:51,233
The scroll is papyrus.

382
00:44:51,316 --> 00:44:53,986
Then it was murder? The Nubian!

383
00:44:57,156 --> 00:44:59,241
Wear this around your neck.

384
00:45:01,577 --> 00:45:04,329
- Why?
- When we fight this creature,

385
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:08,125
we must ask protection
from the forces of all that it defied.

386
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:12,212
- I'll give it to Helen. She needs protection.
- No, her life is not in danger.

387
00:45:12,296 --> 00:45:14,131
It is her soul.

388
00:45:14,214 --> 00:45:18,468
Should love for you come to her,
he will try to destroy you.

389
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:23,307
That amulet, the Egyptians believed,
was a charm against evil sendings,

390
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:25,684
such as struck down your father.

391
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:34,461
Your dog is frightened.

392
00:46:34,545 --> 00:46:36,839
My servant will see to him.

393
00:46:41,844 --> 00:46:43,929
Sit down, Miss Grosvenor.

394
00:46:50,853 --> 00:46:53,355
Ancient Egypt.

395
00:46:53,438 --> 00:46:55,524
Nothing modern.

396
00:47:04,408 --> 00:47:06,702
What a strange incense.

397
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:08,871
Is it not familiar to you?

398
00:47:10,122 --> 00:47:12,958
- No.
- Our forefathers used it.

399
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:16,420
Yours and mine.

400
00:47:20,716 --> 00:47:23,802
You will not remember
what I show you now,

401
00:47:24,094 --> 00:47:31,643
and yet I shall awaken memories
of love and crime and death.

402
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:06,386
I knelt by the bed of death.

403
00:48:40,045 --> 00:48:43,382
Thy father's last farewell.

404
00:49:51,116 --> 00:49:54,453
I knew the Scroll of Thoth
could bring thee back to life.

405
00:50:13,555 --> 00:50:17,768
I dared the god's anger, and stole it.

406
00:50:22,356 --> 00:50:26,318
I stole back to thy tomb
to bring thee back to life.

407
00:50:27,444 --> 00:50:30,447
I murmured the spell that raises the dead.

408
00:50:31,698 --> 00:50:36,870
They broke in upon me
and found me doing an unholy thing.

409
00:50:52,803 --> 00:50:55,931
Thy father condemned me
to the nameless death.

410
00:50:56,014 --> 00:50:57,975
The scroll he ordered buried with me,

411
00:50:58,058 --> 00:51:01,520
that no such sacrilege
might disgrace Egypt again.

412
00:53:08,438 --> 00:53:13,026
A nameless grave. The slaves were killed
so that none should know.

413
00:53:13,986 --> 00:53:17,364
The soldiers who killed them
were also slain,

414
00:53:17,447 --> 00:53:19,449
so no friend could creep to the desert

415
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:22,995
with funeral offerings
for my condemned spirit.

416
00:53:32,171 --> 00:53:34,256
Anck-es-en-Amon.

417
00:53:36,425 --> 00:53:39,887
My love has lasted longer
than the temples of our gods.

418
00:53:41,096 --> 00:53:43,640
No man ever suffered as I did for you.

419
00:53:44,474 --> 00:53:46,977
The rest you may not know.

420
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:52,399
Not until you are about to pass through
the great night of terror and triumph,

421
00:53:52,483 --> 00:53:56,862
until you are ready to face moments
of horror for an eternity of love,

422
00:53:58,489 --> 00:54:01,241
until I send back
your spirit, that has wandered

423
00:54:01,325 --> 00:54:04,369
through so many forms
and so many ages.

424
00:54:06,622 --> 00:54:11,043
But, before then,
Bast must again send forth death.

425
00:54:11,376 --> 00:54:14,838
Death to that boy for whom
love is creeping into your heart.

426
00:54:15,172 --> 00:54:17,674
Love that would keep you from myself.

427
00:54:18,425 --> 00:54:22,387
Love that might bring
sickness and even death to you.

428
00:54:25,557 --> 00:54:27,643
Awake.

429
00:54:32,773 --> 00:54:34,858
Have I been asleep?

430
00:54:36,151 --> 00:54:38,529
I had strange dreams.

431
00:54:39,613 --> 00:54:43,242
Dreams of ancient Egypt, I think.
There was someone like you in them.

432
00:54:43,325 --> 00:54:45,786
My pool is sometimes troubled.

433
00:54:45,869 --> 00:54:50,457
One sees strange fantasies in the water.
But they pass like dreams.

434
00:54:51,834 --> 00:54:55,212
My dog! Wolfram! Wolfram!

435
00:54:55,295 --> 00:54:57,381
Where is he?

436
00:55:07,975 --> 00:55:10,060
Helen.

437
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:17,609
Helen! Where have you been?

438
00:55:18,986 --> 00:55:22,197
We've been so worried.
We've hunted everywhere.

439
00:55:22,281 --> 00:55:24,366
- In the museum again?
- Yes.

440
00:55:24,449 --> 00:55:26,577
Muller's down in the Arab quarter now.

441
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:29,705
Well, if I must give an explanation,
it was stuffy in here.

442
00:55:29,788 --> 00:55:34,960
I can't be shut up all the time. And I don't
like the feeling I'm always being watched.

443
00:55:35,043 --> 00:55:37,838
- I took the dog with me.
- Where is the dog?

444
00:55:45,762 --> 00:55:47,973
He's dead.

445
00:55:48,682 --> 00:55:52,561
- But how?
- I don't know.

446
00:55:52,644 --> 00:55:55,439
- Well, where?
- I don't remember.

447
00:55:56,356 --> 00:55:58,442
But I can see it now.

448
00:55:58,525 --> 00:56:00,777
Standing on poor Wolfram's back.

449
00:56:00,861 --> 00:56:02,988
- A white cat.
- A white cat?

450
00:56:04,031 --> 00:56:06,241
The cat-goddess Bast!

451
00:56:06,825 --> 00:56:09,244
Yes, there was a statue of Bast.

452
00:56:09,328 --> 00:56:11,413
The goddess of evil sendings!

453
00:56:12,456 --> 00:56:15,083
Just what happened?
Try to remember, Helen!

454
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:18,837
I don't want to remember. Besides,
I don't see it's any affair of yours.

455
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:20,964
Oh, but it is.

456
00:56:21,048 --> 00:56:23,342
We know that you were with Ardath Bey.

457
00:56:26,845 --> 00:56:30,265
Oh, Helen. Helen, I love you.

458
00:56:30,349 --> 00:56:33,185
I'm trying to help you
and protect you. We all are.

459
00:56:33,268 --> 00:56:37,272
Don't let me go again.
I'll try to get away, but you mustn't let me.

460
00:56:38,357 --> 00:56:41,026
No matter what I do or what I say.

461
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:43,195
There's death there for me.

462
00:56:43,278 --> 00:56:46,698
And life for something else
inside me that isn't me.

463
00:56:46,782 --> 00:56:49,993
But it's alive too, and fighting for life.

464
00:56:50,077 --> 00:56:52,246
Save me from it, Frank. Save me.

465
00:56:52,429 --> 00:56:54,890
Oh, everything's going to be all right.

466
00:56:54,973 --> 00:56:58,602
Now that you've asked for help,
I'll never leave you alone.

467
00:56:58,685 --> 00:57:02,981
I'll get Mrs Muller down here with you,
and I'll stay here till the doctor comes.

468
00:57:03,065 --> 00:57:05,150
Then, we'll take you to my house.

469
00:57:06,026 --> 00:57:09,279
Oh, Helen. It's been such torture.

470
00:57:09,947 --> 00:57:12,032
I love you so.

471
00:57:13,659 --> 00:57:18,830
I don't like that doctor. Please go in there
and find out what he's saying about me.

472
00:57:18,914 --> 00:57:23,085
I will, my dear. He'll know just
what's the matter with you and cure you.

473
00:57:23,168 --> 00:57:25,254
Now, don't worry.

474
00:57:30,425 --> 00:57:33,595
Now, Miss Farthing, help me
to get dressed and get out of here.

475
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:38,642
- Come over you again, Miss Grosvenor?
- I must escape. I'm being held. Help me.

476
00:57:38,725 --> 00:57:41,436
You told me, when
these fits came on I wasn't to listen.

477
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,564
I have a friend. He's rich.
He'll give you money.

478
00:57:44,648 --> 00:57:47,567
Now you just lie down again.
You know you mustn't get up.

479
00:57:47,651 --> 00:57:49,903
If you don't want money,
what do you want most?

480
00:57:49,987 --> 00:57:53,699
He'll give you anything,
if only you'll help me to go to him.

481
00:57:53,782 --> 00:57:56,368
Do you want me to call Dr Muller?

482
00:57:56,451 --> 00:57:59,913
- No. I hate him.
- Mr Whemple, then?

483
00:58:02,291 --> 00:58:04,293
I'll die if I don't get away from him!

484
00:58:04,376 --> 00:58:06,587
- Now, Miss Grosvenor.
- It's killing me!

485
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:08,964
Now, Helen, you must not do this again.

486
00:58:09,047 --> 00:58:11,592
You're always so exhausted afterwards.

487
00:58:13,885 --> 00:58:16,430
She's too weak to be removed
except to a hospital.

488
00:58:16,513 --> 00:58:19,558
I insist on keeping her here
under our direct observation.

489
00:58:19,641 --> 00:58:23,145
But, Doctor, you haven't told us what
to do. She gets weaker every day.

490
00:58:23,562 --> 00:58:26,982
You know that negligée I bought in Paris?
Help me to put it on.

491
00:58:27,065 --> 00:58:30,652
And bring me my toilet things.
I want some colour. I want to look well.

492
00:58:30,736 --> 00:58:32,988
You can't, my dear. They'd never allow it.

493
00:58:33,071 --> 00:58:35,991
- The nurse would be sure...
- I know. We'll get rid of her.

494
00:58:36,074 --> 00:58:39,912
This is a plot, just between us.
I want to look the way I did.

495
00:58:39,995 --> 00:58:41,955
Just a surprise, for Frank.

496
00:58:42,039 --> 00:58:45,042
And I want you to bring him to me.
You understand?

497
00:58:46,001 --> 00:58:48,962
In short, I have failed to make a diagnosis.

498
00:58:49,046 --> 00:58:52,049
Medical science is helpless
in a case like this.

499
00:58:52,674 --> 00:58:54,760
Frank.

500
00:58:55,719 --> 00:58:59,389
Go to her, and don't be angry with me.
I couldn't resist her.

501
00:59:03,852 --> 00:59:07,147
Helen, you shouldn't have done this.
They shouldn't have let you.

502
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:10,233
Just this once. Perhaps the last time.

503
00:59:10,317 --> 00:59:14,321
But you're going to get well.
Then I know I can make you love me.

504
00:59:14,404 --> 00:59:16,490
I know I can make you happy.

505
00:59:20,619 --> 00:59:24,289
I do love you, Frank.
And I'm trying to prove it,

506
00:59:24,373 --> 00:59:27,000
because I'd rather die
than live and lose you.

507
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:30,796
But you're going to live.
We're not going to lose each other.

508
00:59:32,422 --> 00:59:34,591
- So, my dear. You...
- Don't scold me.

509
00:59:34,675 --> 00:59:38,553
Just feminine vanity.
I wanted to look my best again.

510
00:59:38,637 --> 00:59:41,056
So you know more
than I realised you knew.

511
00:59:41,139 --> 00:59:45,519
- What do you mean?
- These impulses to go to him.

512
00:59:45,602 --> 00:59:48,522
The pull is too strong
to withstand and live.

513
00:59:48,605 --> 00:59:50,691
I am so glad you understand.

514
00:59:52,025 --> 00:59:54,987
Helen knows. She knows
the moment she stops struggling,

515
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:57,531
he will give her back
her strength to come to him.

516
00:59:57,614 --> 01:00:02,369
But I don't want to lose my own mind
and be someone else. Someone I hate.

517
01:00:02,452 --> 01:00:08,375
My dear, while you were growing worse,
we tried to find him and failed.

518
01:00:08,458 --> 01:00:11,461
The next time the call comes, go to him.

519
01:00:16,633 --> 01:00:18,760
Muller, what can we do now?

520
01:00:18,844 --> 01:00:22,347
We can do no more.
Ardath has beaten me.

521
01:00:22,431 --> 01:00:25,350
The next time he draws her to him,
we must follow her.

522
01:00:25,434 --> 01:00:28,437
- And then?
- We will destroy him.

523
01:00:54,254 --> 01:00:57,925
I've given her some bromide.
She's asleep now. I'll go to bed.

524
01:00:58,008 --> 01:01:01,011
- All right. I'll wait till Dr Muller comes.
- Good night.

525
01:01:01,094 --> 01:01:03,180
Good night.

526
01:03:01,214 --> 01:03:03,258
Where are we?

527
01:03:03,342 --> 01:03:07,596
This is my bed, but this is not the temple,
nor my father's palace.

528
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:10,265
Do not look, Anck-es-en-Amon.

529
01:03:10,349 --> 01:03:12,434
Do not be afraid.

530
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:20,233
I was afraid. When you knelt beside my
bed, a veil came over my eyes. Darkness.

531
01:03:20,317 --> 01:03:23,695
Your last memory is of me
in the hour of your death

532
01:03:23,779 --> 01:03:28,533
as I knelt by your bed, 3700 years ago.

533
01:03:28,617 --> 01:03:33,413
No man has ever suffered
for woman as you suffered for me.

534
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:37,459
- Now that the gods have forgiven us...
- No, no, not yet.

535
01:03:38,543 --> 01:03:40,629
Your soul is in a mortal body,

536
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:45,300
renewed many times
since we loved in Thebes of old.

537
01:03:46,677 --> 01:03:51,181
But that love is not for us again
until the great change.

538
01:03:51,265 --> 01:03:53,350
I do not understand.

539
01:03:59,606 --> 01:04:01,692
Look.

540
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:16,123
- Look and wonder.
- A figure of myself.

541
01:04:16,456 --> 01:04:19,585
It is my coffin,
made by my father against my death.

542
01:04:21,461 --> 01:04:24,006
What mummy has usurped
my eternal resting place?

543
01:04:24,089 --> 01:04:28,260
It is thy dead shell.
I tried then to raise this body.

544
01:04:28,343 --> 01:04:33,098
I could raise it now, but it would be
a mere thing that moved at my will,

545
01:04:33,181 --> 01:04:35,267
without a soul.

546
01:05:12,638 --> 01:05:16,141
It was not only this body
that I loved, it was thy soul.

547
01:05:16,224 --> 01:05:19,186
I destroy this lifeless thing.

548
01:05:19,269 --> 01:05:22,397
Thou shalt take its place
but for a few moments,

549
01:05:22,481 --> 01:05:26,860
and then rise again,
even as I have risen.

550
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:47,256
Come.

551
01:06:10,696 --> 01:06:14,157
Imhotep, this is the place of embalming.

552
01:06:15,409 --> 01:06:20,080
It is not lawful for me, a priestess of Isis,
to see or touch an unclean thing.

553
01:06:21,081 --> 01:06:24,418
Come to the altar of Anubis,
the guide of the dead.

554
01:06:35,637 --> 01:06:38,098
The time has come for the final prayer.

555
01:06:38,807 --> 01:06:40,892
What have I to do with Anubis?

556
01:06:45,647 --> 01:06:48,817
The ancient rites
must be performed over thy body.

557
01:06:49,026 --> 01:06:51,236
Then I will read
the great spell with which

558
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:54,907
Isis brought Osiris back from the grave.

559
01:06:54,990 --> 01:06:57,284
And thou shalt rise again.

560
01:06:57,784 --> 01:06:59,786
No.

561
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:02,873
No, I'm alive! I'm young!

562
01:07:02,956 --> 01:07:05,125
I won't die!

563
01:07:05,208 --> 01:07:08,378
I loved you once,
but now you belong with the dead.

564
01:07:09,463 --> 01:07:11,757
I am Anck-es-en-Amon, but I...

565
01:07:13,383 --> 01:07:15,677
I'm somebody else too.

566
01:07:15,761 --> 01:07:18,472
I want to live,
even in a strange new world.

567
01:07:18,555 --> 01:07:21,683
For thy sake I was buried alive.

568
01:07:21,767 --> 01:07:27,564
I ask of thee only a moment of agony.
Only so can we be united.

569
01:07:32,361 --> 01:07:34,446
The bath of natron.

570
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,200
You shall not plunge my body into that.

571
01:07:38,283 --> 01:07:40,410
Let the deed be done.

572
01:07:57,719 --> 01:08:00,347
Let me go. Let me go!

573
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:03,517
Don't kill me! I'm a priestess of Isis.

574
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:06,270
Save me from that mummy! It's dead!

575
01:08:06,979 --> 01:08:09,064
Save me!

576
01:08:33,005 --> 01:08:36,758
I no longer fear you.
Do with me what you will.

577
01:08:53,483 --> 01:08:55,527
Frank.

578
01:08:55,611 --> 01:08:57,946
Frank!

579
01:08:58,030 --> 01:09:00,949
She has gone to him.
They must be in the museum.

580
01:09:02,409 --> 01:09:04,578
Now I know his horrible plan.

581
01:09:05,579 --> 01:09:09,499
He is going to kill her, and
make her a living mummy like himself.

582
01:09:22,471 --> 01:09:27,267
The gods will receive into the underworld
the spirit of Anck-es-en-Amon.

583
01:09:28,268 --> 01:09:30,354
But not for long.

584
01:09:31,271 --> 01:09:34,858
Osiris will release thy soul.

585
01:09:48,288 --> 01:09:53,877
You shall rest from life,
like the setting sun in the west.

586
01:09:53,961 --> 01:09:56,171
But you shall dawn anew in the east,

587
01:09:56,255 --> 01:10:00,509
as the first rays of Amon-Ra
dispel the shadow.

588
01:10:12,562 --> 01:10:14,648
Look! What's that?

589
01:10:18,068 --> 01:10:19,778
Come on.

590
01:10:23,865 --> 01:10:25,951
Anck-es-en-Amon.

591
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,583
Frank! Frank!

592
01:10:41,383 --> 01:10:44,720
Helen! Helen!

593
01:10:46,722 --> 01:10:48,056
Helen.

594
01:10:54,187 --> 01:10:57,441
O Isis, holy maiden.
I was thy consecrated vestal.

595
01:10:57,524 --> 01:10:59,943
I broke my vows. Save me now!

596
01:11:00,027 --> 01:11:03,614
Teach me the ancient summons,
the holy spells I've forgotten.

597
01:11:03,697 --> 01:11:05,782
I call upon thee as of old!

598
01:12:02,547 --> 01:12:04,633
Helen!

599
01:12:05,676 --> 01:12:08,303
Call her. He has dragged her
back to ancient Egypt.

600
01:12:08,387 --> 01:12:11,765
Call her! Her love for you
may bridge the centuries.

601
01:12:12,849 --> 01:12:16,019
Helen. Helen!

602
01:12:16,103 --> 01:12:18,397
Come back. It's Frank.

603
01:12:19,690 --> 01:12:21,775
Come back.
