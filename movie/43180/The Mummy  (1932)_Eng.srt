1
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,568
Trying to teach me a lesson
in patience, Sir Joseph?

2
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,008
Method is everything
in archeology, my boy.

3
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,606
We always deal with our
finds of the day in order.

4
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,650
Well, it seems to me that
that box we dug up today,

5
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,485
with the very peculiar
gentleman, over there,

6
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,722
is the only find we've made
in the past two months

7
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,168
that'll bring this expedition any
medals from the British Museum.

8
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,084
We didn't come to dig
in Egypt for medals.

9
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,887
Much more is learned from
studying bits of broken pottery

10
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,406
than from
all the sensational finds.

11
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,927
Our job is to increase the sum
of human knowledge of the past,

12
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,968
not to satisfy
our own curiosity.

13
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,965
That's all very true, Sir Joseph,
but after all, we're human.

14
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,441
And a find like this...
Well, how can you wait?

15
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,602
This is your first trip.
I've been out here 10 years,

16
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,728
and I'm more curious about
that mummy than you are,

17
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,041
and even more about that box.

18
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,645
Whemple.
Yes?

19
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,203
The viscera were not removed.

20
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,568
The usual scar made by the
embalmer's knife is not there.

21
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,688
I guessed as much, Muller.

22
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,691
I had a good look at him
when I photographed him.

23
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,087
Never saw a mummy like that.

24
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,766
Neither, I imagine,
has anyone else.

25
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,811
Looks as though he died in some
sensationally unpleasant manner.

26
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,331
The contorted muscles show that
he struggled in the bandages.

27
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,965
Buried alive.

28
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,210
"Imhotep,"

29
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,249
"High Priest of the Temple
of the Sun at Karnak."

30
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,881
Poor old fellow.

31
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,884
Now, what could you have done to
make them treat you like that?

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,810
An execution for treason,
I suppose.

33
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,564
Sacrilege,
more likely. Look.

34
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,247
The sacred spells which protect
the soul in its journey to the underworld

35
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,448
have been chipped off
of the coffin.

36
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,923
So Imhotep was sentenced to death not
only in this world, but in the next.

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,607
Maybe he got too gay with the
vestal virgins in the temple.

38
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,966
Possibly.

39
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,485
The priestesses of
the Temple of Karnak

40
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,449
were the daughters
of the reigning pharaohs.

41
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,091
They were the
sacred virgins of Isis.

42
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,084
Maybe the answer's in that box
we found buried with him.

43
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,562
I see I shall get no more work out
of you until after it's open.

44
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,371
Come on. Let's have
the box up there.

45
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,727
The Wood's so rotten, it'll
fall apart at a touch.

46
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,531
Whatever it is,
it's terribly heavy.

47
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,522
Metal.
Looks like copper.

48
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,731
It's gold.

49
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,804
I say! Look here.

50
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,930
The unbroken seals
of the Pharaoh Amenophis.

51
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,843
Some temple treasure.

52
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,691
"Death, eternal punishment"

53
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,483
"for anyone"

54
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,201
"who opens this casket,"

55
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,247
"in the name
of Amon-Ra,"

56
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,323
"the King of the Gods."

57
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,364
Good heavens!
What a terrible curse!

58
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,245
Well, let's see what's inside.
Wait!

59
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,288
You have read the curse.

60
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,680
We recognize your mastery of
the occult sciences, Muller,

61
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,206
but I can't permit your beliefs
to interfere with my work.

62
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,203
Then why did you send
for me this afternoon?

63
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,964
As a friend and an expert.

64
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,725
Because I saw this find was unique,
and I wanted your opinion on it.

65
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,450
It is providential
that you did.

66
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,251
Come, Dr. Muller. Surely a few
thousand years in the earth

67
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,766
would take the mumbo-jumbo
off any old curse.

68
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,968
I cannot speak before a boy.

69
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,926
Come out under
the stars of Egypt.

70
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,842
Do not touch that casket.

71
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,449
Go on with your cataloging.
We'll open it later.

72
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,727
You needn't think you can
persuade me not to examine

73
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,361
the most wonderful find of my
whole experience out here.

74
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,841
If you're right
about the legend,

75
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,605
then this casket may
contain the Scroll of Thoth

76
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,682
from the holy of holies
in the temple.

77
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,410
And I can hardly wait
to get back to find out.

78
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,605
The gods of Egypt still live in these
hills, in their ruined temples.

79
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,923
The ancient spells are weaker, but
some of them are still potent,

80
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,447
and I believe that you have in your
hut the Scroll of Thoth itself,

81
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,366
which contains the great spell by which
Isis raised Osiris from the dead.

82
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,605
Put it back. Bury it
where you found it.

83
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,283
You have read the curse.
You dare defy it?

84
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,887
In the interest of science, even
if I believed in the curse,

85
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,247
I'd go on with my work
for the museum.

86
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,802
Come back with me, and we'll
examine this great find together.

87
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,327
I cannot condone an act of
sacrilege with my presence.

88
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,961
What's the matter, man? For
heaven's sake, what is it?

89
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,442
He... He
went for a little walk.

90
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,041
You should have seen his face.

91
00:12:41,535 --> 00:12:43,055
Here's something
to break the monotony.

92
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,208
There's a visitor coming
up the trail from the Nile.

93
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,611
Color? Nationality?

94
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,569
How could I see in that glare?

95
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,120
Well, Whemple,
back we go to London.

96
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,725
And what fools we look.

97
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,885
Money wasted. Hole after hole
dug in this blasted desert.

98
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,645
A few beads, a few broken pots.

99
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,961
A man needs more than
hard work for this game.

100
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,601
He needs flair. He needs
luck, like your father.

101
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,405
In the days when he used to come out
here, there wasn't so much competition.

102
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,244
When he did, he found things.

103
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,484
And once, 10 years ago,
he found too much.

104
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,608
Was it 10 years ago?

105
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,684
Queer story, that young Oxford
chap he had with him going mad.

106
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,808
You know what I think it was?
No. What?

107
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,645
I think he went crazy, bored
beyond human endurance,

108
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,643
messing around in
this sand and these rocks.

109
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,643
He was laughing when
your father found him.

110
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,371
He died laughing,
in a straitjacket.

111
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,848
Your father never explained.

112
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,730
But when the best excavator
England has turned out,

113
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,600
a man who loved Egypt, said
he'd never come back here,

114
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,569
that meant something.

115
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,644
Come in.

116
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,443
You break your season's camp,
Professor Pearson?

117
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,000
Your colleagues have
returned to London?

118
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,687
Yes. Whemple and I stayed
behind to clear up.

119
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,411
Your expedition has
not been a success.

120
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,007
Scarcely. Here are
the season's finds.

121
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:22,326
Permit me to present you with the most
sensational find since that of Tutankhamen.

122
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,006
This is very sporting
of you. May I ask why?

123
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,881
We Egyptians are not permitted
to dig up our ancient dead.

124
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,804
Only foreign museums.

125
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,770
Well, what's this?

126
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,562
Part of the funerary equipment
of the Princess Anck-es-en-Amon,

127
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,041
daughter of Amenophis
the Magnificent.

128
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,884
Yes. It's her name.

129
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,806
I found that not 100
yards from where we are.

130
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,725
You mean, you think
her tomb is there?

131
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,962
I will show you where to dig.

132
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,889
I'm sure it's very
good of you, Mr...

133
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,889
I didn't catch your name.

134
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,809
Ardeth Bay.

135
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,486
Circumstantial evidence.
Not very strong, perhaps,

136
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,530
but if we put that gang of
diggers from Kerna on the job,

137
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,604
we can tell in two days
if there's anything here.

138
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,808
In one day, Professor.

139
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,969
It's a step!

140
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,246
He was right.

141
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,402
Anyhow, we found something.

142
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,642
The name of
Anck-es-en-Amon.

143
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,961
We will cable your father
in London.

144
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,169
He must be here when we
examine this great find.

145
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,447
The seal of the seven jackals.

146
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,850
And it's unbroken.

147
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:03,367
No one has entered this door since the
priests of the royal necropolis sealed it.

148
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,964
3,700 years ago.

149
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,367
Is there a view like this
in all the world, Helen?

150
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,965
The real Egypt.

151
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,801
Are we really in this
dreadful, modern Cairo?

152
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,282
Your thoughts are far away from the dance
and these nice English boys, my dear.

153
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,966
Not really.
I'm having a lovely time.

154
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,088
I'm so grateful.
But why?

155
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,288
For your keeping me here
with you, of course.

156
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,445
So I don't have to go up to
Father in that beastly hot Sudan.

157
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,967
It's I who am grateful,
my most interesting patient.

158
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,924
Know who that is?

159
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,484
Muller of Vienna.
Really?

160
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,690
Always spends his winters here.
Authority on the Egyptian occult.

161
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,807
Yes, but the girl.

162
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,006
Helen Grosvenor.

163
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,924
Her father's Governor of the Sudan.
English, of course.

164
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,766
Her mother, Egyptian. Some old
family with a tree a mile long.

165
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,888
She's staying here with
Dr. and Mrs. Muller.

166
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,886
Pardon me, sir. Our
closing bell has rung.

167
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,088
I did not notice the time.

168
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,722
I am addressing
Sir Joseph Whemple?

169
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,881
Yes.

170
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,083
I am Ardeth Bay.

171
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,491
Indeed!

172
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,766
Why, we have you to thank that we
have this exhibit here at all.

173
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,049
The museum should be kept
open all night in your honor.

174
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,801
Won't you come down to my office?
I'm working here late.

175
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,770
Your pardon. I dislike
to be touched.

176
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,808
An Eastern prejudice.

177
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,809
Won't you sit down?

178
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,970
You know my son.

179
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,570
Ardeth Bay. Where did you disappear
to when we opened the tomb?

180
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,961
I returned to Cairo.

181
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,601
But... But now
I must not detain you.

182
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,923
But I must see you again. You...
You must come to my house.

183
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,846
I regret I am too occupied
to accept invitations.

184
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,964
He's a strange one.

185
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,489
But you might at least
have thanked the man.

186
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,528
He was responsible for
finding the princess.

187
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,682
Yes. I rather wish
he hadn't been.

188
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,650
I think it's a dirty trick, this Cairo
Museum keeping everything we've found.

189
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,290
That was the contract.

190
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,648
The British Museum works for the
cause of science, not for loot.

191
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,927
Anck-es-en-Amon.

192
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,050
Anck-es-en-Amon.

193
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,088
<i>Anck-es-en-Amon.</i>

194
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,323
Is anything the matter?

195
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,929
Anck-es-en-Amon.

196
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,609
Anck-es-en-Amon.

197
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,727
Where do you want to go, miss?

198
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,848
<i>Le Musée des Antiquités.</i>

199
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,685
Imhotep.

200
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,928
Anck-es-en-Amon.
Anck-es-en-Amon.

201
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,445
Imhotep.

202
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,366
Imhotep.

203
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,885
I must get in.

204
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,724
Anck-es-en-Amon.

205
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,881
I must.

206
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,724
It's closed for the night.
Everybody's gone home.

207
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,290
I must get in.

208
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,325
Imhotep.
Imhotep.

209
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,245
Imhotep.

210
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,686
What's she saying?

211
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,449
What language is that?

212
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,531
The language of Ancient Egypt, not
heard on this earth for 2,000 years.

213
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,369
And the name of a man unspoken
since before the siege of Troy.

214
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,766
Is your master at home?

215
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,171
Yes, <i>efendi.</i>

216
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,323
Tell him Dr. Muller wishes
to see him, urgently.

217
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,485
How did I get here?

218
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,131
We brought you here.
Father and I.

219
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,690
You fainted.

220
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,762
But how did you guess
she was here?

221
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,447
I discovered that she took a taxi
from the hotel to the museum.

222
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,002
I went there. The watchman
said she had left in your car.

223
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:43,002
Before you take her away, I must talk to
you about something she said just now.

224
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,604
Oh, Dr. Muller.

225
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,206
So, here you are, my dear.

226
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,326
I suppose you
introduced yourself.

227
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,447
No?

228
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,285
Miss Helen Grosvenor, my old friend
Sir Joseph Whemple, Frank Whemple.

229
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,569
This seems so formal under
these peculiar circumstances.

230
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,962
And now, if you're all right
again, back we go to the hotel.

231
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,362
I... I think she ought
to rest a few minutes.

232
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,651
Frank, will you make
yourself agreeable?

233
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,960
Well...

234
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,290
Where was I when I fainted, Mr.
Whemple?

235
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,283
Oh, outside the museum.

236
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,249
What was I doing there?

237
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,321
Well, I wouldn't
know that, would I?

238
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,927
No, I don't suppose you would.

239
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,888
I wish I did.
You see, I was waiting...

240
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,121
Let's not talk about it.

241
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,611
Oh, right.

242
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,763
You're partly Egyptian,
aren't you?

243
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,411
Yes. How did you
guess that?

244
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,567
Oh, I don't know.
Just something about you.

245
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,205
You know, I'd have liked Egypt better
if I'd met you there, but no such luck.

246
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,170
Stuck in the desert for two
months, and was it hot!

247
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,446
That tomb!

248
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,851
What tomb?

249
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,280
Surely you read
about the princess.

250
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,488
So you did that.
Yes.

251
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,370
The 14 steps down and the
unbroken seals were thrilling.

252
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,002
But when we came to handle all her clothes
and her jewels and her toilet things...

253
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,731
You know, they buried everything
with them that they used in life.

254
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,848
Well, when we came to
unwrap the girl herself...

255
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,922
How could you do that?

256
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,048
Had to. Science, you know.

257
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,804
Well, after we'd worked among her
things, I felt as if I'd known her.

258
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,007
And when we got the wrappings
off, and I saw her face...

259
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,161
You'll think me silly, but I
sort of fell in love with her.

260
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,166
Do you have to open graves to
find girls to fall in love with?

261
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,801
I say!

262
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,321
Now I know what
it is about you.

263
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,526
There was something
about her head...

264
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,401
I had never mentioned the name,

265
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,008
yet I heard Miss Grosvenor mutter, in
ancient Egyptian, something about Imhotep.

266
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,320
Imhotep?

267
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,885
What was this Ardeth
doing in the museum?

268
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,730
Looking at the mummy,
just at closing time.

269
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,601
Hello.

270
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,401
What?

271
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,407
Come.

272
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,927
A museum guard found dead in
the room of the princess.

273
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,609
So he died of shock.

274
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,845
We find this in dead
guard's hand, Sir Joseph.

275
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:08,005
Probably thief try to steal it.
Guard take it away, thief kill him.

276
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,244
The cause of death,
I not find nothing.

277
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,681
Looks like an attempted theft, but nothing
stolen here could be disposed of.

278
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,569
What is the document?

279
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,971
Let me put this here.
You'll be more comfortable.

280
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,280
Thanks.

281
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,605
You really want to know why I
didn't take you to the hospital?

282
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,205
Because when I held
you in my arms...

283
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,045
Hadn't you better not
commit yourself?

284
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,045
What girl could fail to make a conquest who
collapsed at a man's feet in the moonlight?

285
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,920
Oh, I know it seems absurd when we've
known each other such a short time,

286
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,081
but I'm serious.

287
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,527
Don't you think I've had enough
excitement for one evening,

288
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,127
without the additional thrill of
a strange man making love to me?

289
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,560
But I've never been serious about
this sort of thing before.

290
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,045
Now, look here.

291
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,681
You can tell me to go to the
devil, but you can't laugh at me.

292
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,807
The curse has struck her, and now,
through her, it will strike my son.

293
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,041
Quiet.

294
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,930
Frank, will you come
to your father's study?

295
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,524
Helen, I shall take
you home presently.

296
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,362
I'll be back in a minute.

297
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,083
Imhotep was alive

298
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,164
when that mummy in the museum was
a vestal virgin in the temple.

299
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,687
Thirty-seven hundred years ago!
What's that got to do with us, now?

300
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,922
Your assistant, who
went insane and died,

301
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,401
as you might have done
if you'd seen what he saw,

302
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,404
made a transcription
of part of that scroll.

303
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,370
Yes. I have it still.

304
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,807
You seem to think this thing has
all the devils of Hell in it.

305
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,167
Why not burn it
and be done with it?

306
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,208
An excellent suggestion.

307
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,566
What became of
the mummy of Imhotep?

308
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,404
Somebody stole it.

309
00:32:29,135 --> 00:32:31,535
Look here, Dr. Muller. What's
the matter with Miss Grosvenor?

310
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,042
You still think that that
mummy was stolen, Sir Joseph?

311
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,646
Yes, I...

312
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,041
Oh, I don't know.

313
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,847
A thousand pardons.
I am Ardeth Bay.

314
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,649
I'm Helen Grosvenor.

315
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,128
I called to see Sir Joseph.

316
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,324
He's in the study.

317
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:20,167
A conference?
If I might perhaps wait.

318
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,566
Yes. Of course.

319
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,169
Have we not met before,
Miss Grosvenor?

320
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,244
No, I don't think so.

321
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,727
I don't think one would forget
meeting you, Ardeth Bay.

322
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,004
Then I am mistaken.

323
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,968
But you are of our blood.

324
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,281
As to that, I am not mistaken.

325
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,361
Yes.

326
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,685
My mother was Egyptian.

327
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,526
You must burn
the Scroll of Thoth.

328
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,729
I tell you, it's the
museum's property, not mine.

329
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,840
Who's out there
with Miss Grosvenor?

330
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,685
Ardeth Bay.

331
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,042
He's come for the scroll.

332
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,563
Ardeth Bay,
Dr. Muller.

333
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,326
I accept your invitation, but I find
no solitary student with his books.

334
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,201
I fear my visit is inopportune.

335
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,329
On the contrary, we were
just talking about...

336
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,447
Me?

337
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,249
Your native Egypt.

338
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,688
You know Miss Grosvenor?

339
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,607
Ardeth Bay introduced himself.

340
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,684
Won't you be seated?

341
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,728
Sir Joseph was just
wondering how you knew

342
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,883
where the tomb of the Princess
Anck-es-en-Amon was hidden.

343
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,964
Partly inference,
partly chance.

344
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,930
Sir Joseph, you seem disturbed.

345
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,961
Yes. A tragedy at the
museum after you left.

346
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,606
Tragedy?

347
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,524
When I was there?

348
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,320
When you were there,
Miss Grosvenor?

349
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,970
Yes. They told me I went there and
tried to get in after it was closed.

350
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,008
I don't remember, but...

351
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,408
Helen, it is very late.

352
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,845
Frank, will you please see
Helen back to the hotel?

353
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,082
Certainly, if Miss Grosvenor
will let me.

354
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,328
But I don't want to go.

355
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,165
After what happened,
you need rest badly.

356
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,085
But I don't.

357
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,729
I was tired, but I...

358
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,808
Why, I've never felt
so alive before.

359
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,763
Then as your doctor,
I must order you to go.

360
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,927
I'm not a child.

361
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,604
Yes. Please,
come.

362
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,281
Then, Ardeth Bay, <i>au revoir.</i>

363
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,761
But we must see
each other again.

364
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,684
I shall be honored.

365
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,690
An unusual crime.

366
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,329
A guard killed by a man who
left a gift to the museum.

367
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,481
A sift?

368
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,005
A scroll.

369
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,448
Part of which was transcribed
when it was first found.

370
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,522
Here is the transcription.

371
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,442
I cannot read the writing
of a period so remote.

372
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,404
But you read the name of Anck-es-en-Amon
on that piece of pottery.

373
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,568
That was of the 18th Dynasty.

374
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,246
These are Predynastic
ideographs.

375
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,842
The scroll from which this was
copied was stolen 10 years ago,

376
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,003
together with the mummy
of the High Priest Imhotep.

377
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,730
Most interesting.

378
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,801
May I see that scroll,
Sir Joseph?

379
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,770
We left it at the museum.

380
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,367
So.

381
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,288
I have something else
to show you. A photograph.

382
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,927
Why do you show all this to me?

383
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,044
Do you think it conceivable
that the mummy was not stolen,

384
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,010
but restored to a semblance of life
by the spell from the Scroll of...

385
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,402
That scroll is my property.
I bought it from a dealer.

386
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,121
It is here in this house.
I presume in that room.

387
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,729
We had foreseen this.

388
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,488
The scroll is in safe hands,

389
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,770
and will be destroyed the minute it
is known that harm has come to us.

390
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,003
You have studied our ancient arts, and
you know that you cannot harm me.

391
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,801
You also know that you must
return that scroll to me or die.

392
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,880
Now tell that weak fool to get
that scroll, wherever it is,

393
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,009
and hand it to
his Nubian servant.

394
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,041
The Nubian!

395
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,088
The ancient blood.

396
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,527
So you have made him
your slave.

397
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,770
If I could get my hands on you,

398
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,002
I'd break your
dried flesh to pieces.

399
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,248
But your power is too strong.

400
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,483
This is the evil force that
has been attacking her.

401
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,841
Burn the scroll, man.
Burn it!

402
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,888
It was through you this
horror came into existence.

403
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,248
It's true.
It's true.

404
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,328
Your father destroyed the scroll, knowing
that it would cost him his life.

405
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,689
What's that?

406
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,807
Isis, the Egyptian
symbol of life.

407
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,084
I meant it for your father.

408
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,164
What good could that old
charm have done him?

409
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,684
I tell you, the doctors say it's
a plain case of heart failure.

410
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,643
The Nubian is missing.

411
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,686
He's an old servant. He was
frightened, but he'll be back.

412
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,890
Don't try and make me believe that this
Ardeth fellow is a mummy come to life.

413
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,486
It was that idea and the horror
of it that killed my father.

414
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,281
The museum guard died
of natural causes, too.

415
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,607
Frank, I need your help.

416
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:18,685
I saw your attraction to my patient
last night, and hers to you.

417
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,809
Hers to me? Do you
really think so?

418
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,609
And I welcomed it.

419
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,250
But do you think
I have a chance?

420
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,641
'Cause I think
she's the most...

421
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,204
But this is terrible
at a time like this.

422
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,205
Frank, I'm afraid. Will you
go with me to her now?

423
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,360
Yes.

424
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,529
Then telephone her first
not to leave the hotel.

425
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,484
9-5-9-0.

426
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,722
No, I'm not going out.

427
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,087
Yes, I promise to wait
until you get here.

428
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,726
Goodbye.

429
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,488
And I'm so dreadfully sorry.

430
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,845
You know...

431
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,081
What were you doing, Doctor?

432
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,609
Your father did not burn the Scroll
of Thoth. That creature has it now.

433
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,760
But the ashes in the fireplace.

434
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,929
They were newspaper.
The scroll is papyrus.

435
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,450
Then it was murder.
The Nubian.

436
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,602
Wear this around your neck.

437
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,007
Why?

438
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,730
When we fight this creature,

439
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,486
we must ask protection from the
forces of old that it defied.

440
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,329
I'll give it to Helen. She's
the one that needs protection.

441
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,882
No. Her life is not
in danger. It is her soul.

442
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,884
Should love for you come to her,
he will try to destroy you.

443
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,201
That amulet, the
Egyptians believe,

444
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,723
was a charm against evil sendings
such as struck down your father.

445
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,201
Your dog is frightened.
My servant will see to him.

446
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,202
Sit down, Miss Grosvenor.

447
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,730
Ancient Egypt.

448
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,410
Nothing modern.

449
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,961
What a strange incense.

450
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,088
Is it not familiar to you?

451
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,131
No.
Our forefathers used it.

452
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,641
Yours and mine.

453
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,368
You will not remember
what I show you now,

454
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,968
and yet I shall awaken
memories of love

455
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,930
and crime and death.

456
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,805
<i>I knelt by the bed of death.</i>

457
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,728
<i>Thy father's last farewell.</i>

458
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,087
<i>I knew the Scroll of Thoth
could bring thee back to life.</i>

459
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,084
<i>I dared the gods' anger
and stole it.</i>

460
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:26,765
<i>I stole back to thy tomb
to bring thee back to life.</i>

461
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,127
<i>I murmured the spell
that raises the dead,</i>

462
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,248
<i>but they broke in upon me</i>

463
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,529
<i>and found me doing
an unholy thing.</i>

464
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:56,402
<i>Thy father condemned me
to the nameless death.</i>

465
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,289
<i>The scroll he ordered
buried with me,</i>

466
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,648
<i>that no such sacrilege
might disgrace Egypt again.</i>

467
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,524
<i>A nameless grave.</i>

468
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:14,241
<i>The slaves were killed
so that none should know.</i>

469
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,608
<i>The soldiers who killed them
were also slain,</i>

470
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,048
<i>so no friend could creep to the
desert with funeral offerings</i>

471
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,122
<i>for my condemned spirit.</i>

472
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,648
Anck-es-en-Amon.

473
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,800
My love has lasted longer
than the temples of our gods.

474
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,928
No man ever suffered
as I did for you.

475
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,526
But the rest you may not know.

476
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:52,891
Not until you are about to pass through
the great night of terror and triumph,

477
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,289
until you are ready to face moments
of horror for an eternity of love.

478
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,883
Until I send back your spirit

479
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,045
that has wandered through so
many forms and so many ages.

480
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:11,762
But before then, Bast must
again send forth death.

481
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:15,640
Death to that boy for whom love
is creeping into your heart.

482
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,326
Love that would keep
you from myself.

483
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:23,084
Love that might bring sickness
and even death to you.

484
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,206
Awake.

485
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,004
Have I been asleep?

486
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,121
I had strange dreams.

487
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,282
Dreams of Ancient
Egypt, I think.

488
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,805
There was someone
like you in them.

489
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,326
My pool is sometimes troubled.

490
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,962
One sees strange fantasies in the
water, but they pass like dreams.

491
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:55,807
My dog! Wolfram!
Wolfram!

492
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,291
Where is he?

493
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,041
Helen.

494
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,481
Helen, where have you been?

495
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,169
We've been so worried.
We've hunted everywhere.

496
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,322
In the museum again?
Yes.

497
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,528
Muller's down in
the Arab quarter now.

498
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,683
Well, if I must give an
explanation, it was stuffy in here.

499
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,489
I can't be shut up
all the time.

500
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,843
Besides, I don't like the feeling
that I'm always being watched.

501
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,763
I took the dog with me.

502
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,729
Well, where is the dog?

503
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,521
He's... He's dead.

504
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,880
But how?

505
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,410
I don't know.

506
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:55,881
Where?

507
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,844
I don't remember.

508
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:03,970
But I can see it now, standing on
poor Wolfram's back, a white cat.

509
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,451
A white cat?

510
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,849
The cat goddess, Bast.

511
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,201
Yes, there was
a statue of Bast.

512
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,487
The goddess of evil sendings!

513
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,046
Just what happened?
Try to remember, Helen.

514
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,043
I don't want to remember.

515
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,804
Besides, I don't see
that it's any affair of yours.

516
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,771
Oh, but it is. We know that
you were with Ardeth Bay.

517
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,608
Oh, Helen.

518
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:34,162
Helen, I love you. I'm trying
to help you and protect you.

519
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,005
We all are.
Don't let me go again.

520
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:42,160
I'll try to get away, but you mustn't let
me, no matter what I do or what I say.

521
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:48,086
There's death there for me, and life for
something else inside me that isn't me.

522
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,009
But it's alive, too,
and fighting for life.

523
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,287
Save me from it, Frank.
Save me.

524
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,761
Oh, everything's
going to be all right.

525
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:00,606
Now that you've asked for help,
I'll never leave you alone.

526
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:04,685
I'll get Mrs. Muller down here with you,
and I'll stay here till the doctor comes.

527
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,366
And then, we'll
take you to my house.

528
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:11,049
Oh, Helen,
it's been such torture.

529
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:12,887
I love you so.

530
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,602
I don't like that doctor.

531
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,767
Please go in there and find out
what he's saying about me.

532
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,126
I will, my dear.

533
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,010
He'll know just what's the
matter with you, and cure you.

534
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,684
Now, don't worry.

535
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,569
Now, Miss Sparling, help me to
get dressed and get out of here.

536
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,284
It's come over you again,
Miss Grosvenor.

537
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,569
I must escape. I'm being held here.
You must help me.

538
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,405
But you told me when these fits
came on, I wasn't to listen.

539
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,649
I have a friend. He's rich.
He'll give you money.

540
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,530
Now you just lie down again.
You know you mustn't get up.

541
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,967
Well, if you don't want money,
what do you want most?

542
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:55,681
He'll give you anything, if only
you'll help me to go to him.

543
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,047
You want me to
call Dr. Muller?

544
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,568
No. I hate him.

545
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,610
Mr. Whemple, then?

546
00:58:04,135 --> 00:58:06,535
I'll die if I don't get away from him.
Now, Miss Grosvenor...

547
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,403
It's killing me. Do you hear?
Please, please!

548
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,926
Now, Helen, you must
not do this again.

549
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,606
You're always so
exhausted afterwards.

550
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,446
She's too weak to be removed,
except to a hospital.

551
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:21,490
I insist on keeping her here
under our direct observation.

552
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,682
But Dr. LeBarron, you haven't
told us what to do for her.

553
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,330
She's getting weaker every day.

554
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,482
You know that negligee
I bought in Paris?

555
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:30,166
Help me to put it on,
and bring me my toilet things.

556
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,527
I want some color.
I want to look well.

557
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,600
But you can't do that, my dear. They'd
never allow it. The nurse would be...

558
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,927
I know.
We'll get rid of her.

559
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,287
This is a plot,
just between us.

560
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:43,887
I want to look the way I did.
Just a surprise, for Frank.

561
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:47,203
And I want you to bring him to me.
You understand?

562
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,930
In short, I have failed
to make a diagnosis.

563
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,129
Medical science is helpless
in a case like this.

564
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,806
Frank.

565
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,201
Go to her, and
don't be angry with me.

566
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,169
I couldn't resist her.

567
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,723
Oh, but Helen, you
shouldn't have done this.

568
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,086
They shouldn't have let you.

569
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,209
Just this once.
Perhaps the last time.

570
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,123
But you're going to get well.

571
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,248
Then I know I can
make you love me.

572
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,482
I know I can make you happy.

573
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,280
I do love you, Frank.
And I'm trying to prove it,

574
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,409
because I'd rather die
than live and lose you.

575
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:33,201
But you're going to live. We're
not going to lose each other.

576
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,482
So, my dear...
Don't scold me.

577
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:40,485
Just feminine vanity. I
wanted to look my best again.

578
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,961
So you know more than
I realized you knew.

579
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,041
What do you mean?

580
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,442
These impulses to go to him.

581
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:50,530
The pull is too strong
to withstand and live.

582
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,682
I'm so glad you understand.

583
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,081
Helen knows.

584
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,003
She knows the moment
she stops struggling,

585
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,401
he will give her back
her strength to come to him.

586
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,608
But I don't want to
lose my own mind

587
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,445
and be someone else,
someone I hate.

588
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:07,410
My dear, while you
were growing worse,

589
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,324
we tried to find him
and failed.

590
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,370
The next time the call
comes, go to him.

591
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,766
Muller, what can we do now?

592
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:24,367
We can do no more.
Ardeth has beaten me.

593
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,284
The next time he draws her
to him, we must follow her.

594
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:28,691
And then?

595
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,531
We will destroy him.

596
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:59,886
I've given her some bromide. She's
asleep now. I'll go to bed.

597
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,042
All right. I'll wait here till Dr.
Muller comes.

598
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,088
Good night.
Good night.

599
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,611
Where are we?

600
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:09,530
This is my bed, but this is not the
temple nor my father's palace.

601
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,807
Do not look,
Anck-es-en-Amon.

602
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,044
Do not be afraid.

603
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,530
I was afraid.

604
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:22,243
When you were kneeling beside my bed,
a veil came over my eyes. Darkness.

605
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:25,648
Your last memory is of me
in the hour of your death

606
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:30,806
as I knelt by your bed,
3,700 years ago.

607
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:35,408
No man has ever suffered for
woman as you suffered for me.

608
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,681
And now that the gods
have forgiven us...

609
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,370
No, no, not yet.

610
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,921
Your soul is in a mortal body,

611
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,482
renewed many times since
we loved in Thebes of old.

612
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:52,321
But that love is not for us
again until the great change.

613
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,249
I do not understand.

614
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:02,766
Look.

615
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,884
Look and wonder.

616
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,444
Figure of myself.

617
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:21,808
It is my coffin, made by my
father against my death.

618
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,171
What mummy has usurped my
eternal resting place?

619
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,208
It is thy dead shell.

620
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:31,762
I tried then to raise this
body. I could raise it now.

621
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,450
But it would be a mere thing that
moved at my will, without a soul.

622
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:18,242
It was not only this body
that I loved. It was thy soul.

623
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,607
I destroy this lifeless thing.

624
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:24,483
Thou shalt take its place
but for a few moments,

625
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:29,122
and then rise again,
even as I have risen.

626
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,361
Come.

627
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:16,606
Imhotep, this is the
place of embalmment.

628
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:22,247
It is not lawful for me, a priestess of
Isis, to see or touch an unclean thing.

629
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:26,687
Come to the altar of Anubis,
the guide of the dead.

630
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,850
The time has come
for the final prayers.

631
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:43,127
What have I to do with Anubis?

632
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:51,082
The ancient rites must be
performed over thy body.

633
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,844
Then I will read
the great spell

634
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:56,322
with which Isis brought
Osiris back from the grave.

635
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,680
And thou shalt rise again.

636
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,046
No.

637
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:06,084
No, I'm alive!
I'm young! I won't die!

638
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,727
I loved you once, but now
you belong with the dead.

639
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,369
I am Anck-es-en-Amon,

640
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:17,043
but I... I'm somebody else, too.

641
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,565
I want to live, even in
this strange new world.

642
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:23,809
For thy sake
I was buried alive.

643
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:27,043
I ask of thee only
a moment of agony.

644
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,566
Only so can we be united.

645
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,124
The bath of natron.

646
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,410
You shall not plunge
my body into that!

647
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,323
Let the deed be done.

648
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:02,405
Let me go!
Let me go!

649
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,643
Don't kill me! I'm a
priestess of Isis!

650
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:10,123
Save me from that mummy!
It's dead! Save me!

651
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:38,766
I no longer fear you.
Do with me what you will.

652
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:56,881
Frank!

653
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:58,841
Frank!

654
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,243
She's gone to him.
They must be in the museum.

655
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,727
Now I know his horrible plan.

656
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,565
He's going to kill her and make
her a living mummy, like himself.

657
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:29,208
The gods will receive into the underworld
the spirit of Anck-es-en-Amon.

658
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,084
But not for long.

659
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:36,921
Osiris will release thy soul.

660
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,807
You shall rest from life,

661
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,281
like the setting sun
in the West.

662
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,202
But you shall dawn anew
in the East

663
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:01,966
as the first rays of
Amon-Ra dispel the shadows.

664
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,842
Look! What's that?

665
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:21,446
Come on!

666
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,650
Frank! Frank!

667
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,890
Helen!

668
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,001
Helen!

669
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,001
Helen!

670
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,924
Oh, Isis! Holy Maiden!

671
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,050
I was thy consecrated vestal.
I broke my vows. Save me now!

672
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:05,602
Teach me the ancient summons,
the holy spells I've forgotten.

673
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,762
I call upon thee as of old!

674
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:05,846
Helen.

675
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,570
Call her. He has dragged
her back to Ancient Egypt.

676
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:14,241
Call her! Her love for
you may bridge the centuries.

677
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,042
Helen. Helen!

678
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,560
Come back.
It's Frank.

679
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,091
Come back.
