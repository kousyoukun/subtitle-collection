1
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,349
Trying to teach me
a lesson in patience, Sir Joseph?

2
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,476
Method is everything in archaeology.

3
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,949
We always deal with
our finds of the day in order.

4
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,759
Well, it seems to me
that that box we dug up today,

5
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,400
with the very peculiar
gentleman over there,

6
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,675
is the only find we've made in two months

7
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,911
that'll bring this expedition
medals from the British Museum.

8
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,958
We didn't come
to dig in Egypt for medals.

9
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,508
Much more is learned
from bits of broken pottery

10
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,830
than from all the sensational finds.

11
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,037
Our job is to increase
the sum of human knowledge of the past,

12
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,997
not to satisfy our own curiosity.

13
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,959
Oh, that's all very true, Sir Joseph,
but, after all, we're human.

14
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,237
- And a find like this! How can you wait?
- This is your first trip.

15
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,676
I've been here ten years. I'm more
curious about the mummy than you.

16
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,830
And even more about that box.

17
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,672
- Whemple.
- Yes?

18
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,798
The viscera were not removed.

19
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,997
The usual scar made
by the embalmer's knife is not there.

20
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,593
I guessed as much, Muller.

21
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,753
I had a good look at him
when I photographed him.

22
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,070
Never saw a mummy like that.

23
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,549
Neither, I imagine, has anyone else.

24
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,031
Looks as though he died in some
sensationally unpleasant manner.

25
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,754
The contorted muscles show
that he struggled in the bandages.

26
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,831
Buried alive?

27
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,955
"Imhotep".

28
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,511
"High Priest of
the Temple of the Sun at Karnak".

29
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,588
Poor old fella. Now, what could you have
done to make 'em treat you like that?

30
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,989
An execution for treason, I suppose.

31
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,276
Sacrilege, more likely.

32
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,354
Look. Sacred spells which protect
the soul in its journey to the underworid

33
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,635
have been chipped off the coffin.

34
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,918
So Imhotep was sentenced to death
not only in this worid, but in the next.

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,436
Maybe he got too gay
with the vestal virgins in the temple.

36
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,991
Possibly. The priestesses of the Temple
of Karnak were daughters of the Pharaoh.

37
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,071
They were the secret virgins of Isis.

38
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,433
Maybe the answer's
in that box we found buried with him.

39
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,717
I see I shall get no more work
out of you until after it's open.

40
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,270
- Come on.
- Let's have the box.

41
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,189
Oh dear. The wood's so rotten
it'll fall apart at a touch.

42
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,949
Whatever it is, it's terribly heavy.

43
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,711
Metal. Looks like copper.

44
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,111
It's gold.

45
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,108
I say. Look here.

46
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,950
The unbroken seals
of the Pharaoh Amenophis.

47
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,431
Some temple treasure.

48
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:28,150
"Death, eternal punishment, for...
anyone... who... opens... this... casket."

49
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,437
"In the name of Amon-Ra,
the king of the gods."

50
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,315
Good heavens, what a terrible curse!

51
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,554
- Well, let's see what's inside!
- Wait!

52
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,200
You will break the curse.

53
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,875
We recognise your mastery
of the occult sciences, Muller.

54
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,349
But your beliefs can't
interfere with my work.

55
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,910
- Then why did you send for me today?
- As a friend and an expert.

56
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,594
This find was unique
and I wanted your opinion.

57
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,353
- It's providential that you did.
- Oh, come, Dr Muller.

58
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,228
Surely a few thousand years in the earth
take the mumbo jumbo off any old curse.

59
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,231
Oh, I cannot speak before a boy.

60
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,110
Come out under the stars of Egypt.

61
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,071
Do not touch that casket.

62
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,198
Go on with your cataloguing.
We'll open it later.

63
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,589
Don't think you can
persuade me not to examine

64
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,229
the most wonderful find
of my whole experience out here.

65
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,476
If you are right about the legend, then this
casket may contain the Scroll of Thoth,

66
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,394
from the holy of holies in the temple, and
I can hardly wait to get back to find out.

67
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,234
The gods of Egypt still live in these hills,
in their ruined temples.

68
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,517
The ancient spells are weaker,
but some of them are still potent.

69
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,876
And I believe that you have
in your hut the Scroll of Thoth itself,

70
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,635
which contains the great spell with which
Isis raised Osiris from the dead.

71
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,752
Put it back. Bury it where you found it.

72
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,832
You have read the curse. You dare defy
it?

73
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,436
In the interests of science,
even if I believed in the curse,

74
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,715
I'd go on with my work for the museum.

75
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,076
Come back with me and we'll
examine this great find together.

76
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,710
I cannot condone
an act of sacrilege with my presence.

77
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,871
What's the matter, man?
For heaven's sakes, what is it?

78
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,557
He... He went for a little walk!

79
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,835
You should have seen his face!

80
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,789
Here's something to break the monotony.
A visitor coming from the Nile.

81
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,077
- Colour? Nationality?
- How could I see in that glare?

82
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,390
Well, Whemple, back we go to London.

83
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,474
And what fools we look. Money wasted.
Hole after hole dug in this blasted desert.

84
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,071
A few beads. A few broken pots.

85
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,950
A man needs more
than hard work for this game.

86
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,396
He needs flair.
He needs luck. Like your father.

87
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,199
When he came here,
there wasn't so much competition.

88
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:41,991
When he did, he found things. And once,
ten years ago, he found too much.

89
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,995
Was it ten years? Queer story, that young
Oxford chap he had with him going mad.

90
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,071
- You know what I think it was?
- No. What?

91
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,597
He went crazy. Bored beyond human
endurance in this sand and these rocks.

92
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,595
He was laughing when your father found
him. He died laughing, in a straitjacket.

93
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,591
Your father never explained.

94
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,117
But when the best excavator England
has turned out, a man who loved Egypt,

95
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,431
said he'd never come back here,
that meant something.

96
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,111
Come in.

97
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,832
You break your season's camp,
Professor Pearson?

98
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,309
Your colleagues
have returned to London?

99
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,915
Yes. Whemple and I
stayed behind to clear up.

100
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,673
Your expedition has not been a success.

101
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,594
Scarcely.
Here are the season's finds.

102
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,589
Permit me to present you
with the most sensational find

103
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,910
since that of Tutankhamen.

104
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,514
This is very sporting of you!
May I ask why?

105
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,196
We Egyptians are not permitted
to dig up our ancient dead.

106
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,078
Only... foreign museums.

107
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,839
What's this?

108
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,879
Part of the funerary equipment
of the princess Anck-es-en-Amon.

109
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,553
- Daughter of Amenophis the Magnificent.
- Yes. It's her name.

110
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,633
I found that not 100 yards
from where we are.

111
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,679
- You mean you think her tomb is there?
- I will show you where to dig.

112
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,148
I'm sure it's very good of you, Mr...?
I didn't catch your name.

113
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,231
Ardath Bey.

114
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,709
Circumstantial evidence.
Not very strong, perhaps.

115
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,678
But if we put that gang
of diggers from Kerma on the job,

116
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,513
we can tell in two days
if there's anything here.

117
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,352
In one day, Professor.

118
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,278
- It's a step.
- He was right.

119
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,351
Anyhow, we've found something.

120
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,717
- The name of Anck-es-en-Amon.
- We will cable your father in London.

121
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,553
He must be here when
we examine this great find.

122
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,631
The seal of the seven jackals.

123
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,716
And it's unbroken.

124
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,510
No one has entered this door since
the priests of the royal acropolis sealed it.

125
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,554
3700 years ago.

126
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,836
Is there a view like this
in all the worid, Helen?

127
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,911
The real Egypt.

128
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,119
Are we really in
this dreadful modern Cairo?

129
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,236
Your thoughts are far from the dance
and these nice English boys.

130
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,754
Not really. I'm having a lovely time.

131
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,876
- I'm so grateful.
- But why?

132
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,996
Your keeping me here with you, of
course.

133
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,675
So I don't have to go up to Father
in that beastly hot Sudan.

134
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,317
It's I who am grateful.
My most interesting patient.

135
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,351
Know who that is?

136
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,357
- Muller of Vienna.
- Really?

137
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,433
Always spends his winters here.
Authority on Egyptian occult.

138
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,670
- Yes, but the girl?
- Helen Grosvenor.

139
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,833
Her father's governor of the Sudan.
English, of course. Her mother, Egyptian.

140
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,913
Some old family with a tree a mile long.
She's staying here with Dr and Mrs
Muller.

141
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,348
Pardon me, sir. Our closing bell has rung.

142
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,237
I did not notice the time.

143
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,559
- I am addressing Sir Joseph Whemple?
- Yes.

144
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,238
- I am Ardath Bey.
- Indeed!

145
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,515
Why, we have you to thank
that we have this exhibit here at all.

146
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,672
The museum should be kept open
all night in your honour.

147
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,355
Won't you come down to my office?
I'm working here late.

148
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,590
Your pardon. I dislike to be touched.

149
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,271
An Eastern prejudice.

150
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,791
Won't you sit down?

151
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,271
You know my son?

152
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,628
Ardath Bey. Where did you disappear
to when we opened the tomb?

153
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,195
I returned to Cairo.

154
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,477
But... but now I must not detain you.

155
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,877
But I must see you again.
You must come to my house.

156
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,396
I regret I am too occupied
to accept invitations.

157
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,950
He's a strange one.

158
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,794
You might have thanked him. He was
responsible for finding the princess.

159
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,791
Yes. I rather wish he hadn't been.

160
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,792
It's a dirty trick,
Cairo Museum keeping what we've found.

161
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,635
That was the contract. The British
Museum works for science, not for loot.

162
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,831
Anck-es-en-Amon.

163
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,839
Anck-es-en-Amon.

164
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,911
<i>Anck-es-en-Amon.</i>

165
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,031
Is anything the matter?

166
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,392
Anck-es-en-Amon.

167
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,392
Anck-es-en-Amon.

168
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,189
Where do you want to go, miss?

169
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,919
<i>Le musée des Antiquités.</i>

170
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,431
<i>Le musée des Antiquités.</i>

171
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,271
Imhotep.

172
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,231
Anck-es-en-Amon.

173
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,399
Anck-es-en-Amon.

174
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,950
Imhotep.

175
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,192
Imhotep.

176
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,794
I must get in.

177
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,712
Anck-es-en-Amon.

178
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,633
- I must!
- It's closed for the night. They've gone.

179
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,711
I must get in.

180
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,154
Imhotep. Imhotep.

181
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,311
Imhotep.

182
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,477
What's she saying?

183
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,149
What language is that?

184
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,270
The language of ancient Egypt.
Not heard on this earth for 2000 years.

185
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,152
And the name of a man unspoken
since before the siege of Troy.

186
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,834
- Is your master at home?
- Yes, sir.

187
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,639
Tell him Dr Muller wishes
to see him urgently.

188
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,188
- How did I get here?
- We brought you here. Father and I.

189
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,271
You fainted.

190
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,511
But how did you guess she was here?

191
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,990
I discovered that she took a taxi
from the hotel to the museum.

192
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,390
I went there. The watchman said
she had left in your car.

193
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:37,190
Before you take her away, I must talk
to you about something she said just now.

194
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,668
- Oh, Dr Muller.
- Oh, here you are, my dear.

195
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,955
I suppose you introduced yourself?

196
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:56,672
No? Miss Helen Grosvenor, my old friend
Sir Joseph Whemple, Frank Whemple.

197
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,832
That seems so formal under
these peculiar circumstances.

198
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,071
And now, if you're all right again,
back we go to the hotel.

199
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,913
I think she'll want to rest a few minutes.

200
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,154
Frank, will you make yourself agreeable?

201
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,872
Well...

202
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,599
Where was I when I fainted, Mr Whemple?

203
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:26,151
- Oh, outside the museum.
- What was I doing there?

204
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,550
Well, I wouldn't know that, would I?

205
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,872
No, I don't suppose you would.
I wish I did.

206
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,951
- I was waiting...
- Don't talk about it.

207
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,031
Oh, right.

208
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,431
- You're partly Egyptian, aren't you?
- Yes.

209
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,511
How did you guess that?

210
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,749
Well, I don't know.
Just something about you.

211
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,429
I'd have liked Egypt better
if I'd met you there.

212
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,672
No such luck! Stuck in the desert
for two months, and was it hot!

213
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,830
- That tomb.
- What tomb?

214
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,634
Surely you read about the princess?

215
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,631
- So you did that?
- Yes.

216
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,553
The 14 steps down
and the unbroken seals were thrilling.

217
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,872
But when we came to handle all her
clothes, her jewels and her toilet things...

218
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,520
They buried everything
with them they used in life.

219
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,559
- When we came to unwrap the girl...
- How could you do that?

220
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,074
Had to! Science, you know!

221
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:29,199
Well, after we'd worked among her things,
I felt as if I'd known her.

222
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,675
But when we got the wrappings off,
and I saw her face...

223
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,150
You'll think me silly,
but I sort of fell in love with her.

224
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,835
Do you have to open graves
to find giris to fall in love with?

225
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,552
I say. Now I know what it is about you.

226
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,279
There was something about her head...

227
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,632
I had never mentioned the name,
yet I heard Miss Grosvenor

228
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,951
mutter in ancient Egyptian
something about Imhotep.

229
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,031
Imhotep?

230
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,354
What was this Ardath
doing in the museum?

231
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,398
Looking at the mummy.
Just at closing time.

232
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,438
Hello?

233
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,511
What?

234
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,431
<i>II est mort?</i>

235
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,072
<i>Tout de suite, effendi.</i>

236
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,949
Come. A museum guard found dead
in the room with the princess.

237
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,915
Fear. Fear.

238
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,150
So he died of shock.

239
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,708
We find this in dead guard's hand,
Sir Joseph.

240
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,918
Probably thief tried to steal it.
Guard take it away, thief kill him.

241
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,838
The cause of death, I not find nothing.

242
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,150
Looks like an attempted theft, but
nothing stolen here could be sold.

243
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,231
What is the document?

244
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,274
Let me put this here.
You'll be more comfortable.

245
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,715
Thanks.

246
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,634
You really want to know why
I didn't take you to the hospital?

247
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,838
- Because, when I held you in my arms...
- Hadn't you better not commit yourself?

248
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,833
What girl could not make a conquest who
collapsed at a man's feet in moonlight?

249
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,675
It seems absurd when we've known each
other such a short time, but I'm serious.

250
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,035
Haven't I had enough
excitement for one evening,

251
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,430
without the additional thrill
of a strange man making love to me?

252
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,717
But I've never been serious
about this sort of thing before.

253
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,635
Now, look here. You can tell me to go
to the devil, but you can't laugh at me.

254
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,275
The curse has struck her, and now,
through her, it will strike my son.

255
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,078
Quiet.

256
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,636
Frank, will you come
to your father's study?

257
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,393
Helen, I shall take you home presently.

258
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,191
I'll be back in a minute.

259
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,598
Imhotep was alive
when that mummy in the museum

260
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,477
was a vestal virgin in the temple.

261
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,711
3700 years ago!
What's that got to do with us now?

262
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,030
Your assistant who went insane and died,

263
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,315
as you might have
if you'd seen what he saw,

264
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,198
made a transcription of part of that scroll.

265
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,999
Yes. I have it still.

266
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,631
You seem to think it has all the devils of
hell in it. Burn it and be done with it.

267
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,711
An excellent suggestion.

268
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,550
What became of the mummy of Imhotep?

269
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,071
Somebody stole it!

270
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,594
Look, what's the matter
with Miss Grosvenor?

271
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,956
You still think that
that mummy was stolen, Sir Joseph?

272
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,551
Yes. I... I really don't know.

273
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,831
A thousand pardons. I am Ardath Bey.

274
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,791
I am Helen Grosvenor.

275
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,871
I called to see Sir Joseph.

276
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,955
- He's in the study.
- In conference?

277
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,031
If I might perhaps wait?

278
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,874
Yes. Of course.

279
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,997
Have we not met before, Miss Grosvenor?

280
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,390
No. I don't think so.

281
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,629
I don't think one would forget
meeting you, Ardath Bey.

282
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,711
Then I am mistaken.

283
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,196
But you are of our blood.

284
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,271
As to that, I am not mistaken.

285
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,678
Yes. My mother was Egyptian.

286
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,309
You must burn the Scroll of Thoth!

287
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,949
I tell you,
it's the museum's property, not mine.

288
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,190
Who's out there with Miss Grosvenor?

289
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,195
Ardath Bey!

290
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,271
He's come for the scroll.

291
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,354
Ardath Bey, Dr Muller.

292
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,713
I accept your invitation. But I find
no solitary student with his books.

293
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,791
I fear my visit is inopportune.

294
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,917
On the contrary.
We were just talking about...

295
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,036
- Me?
- Your native Egypt.

296
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,554
You know Miss Grosvenor?

297
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,200
Ardath Bey introduced himself.

298
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,991
Won't you be seated?

299
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,996
Sir Joseph was just
wondering how you knew

300
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,038
where the tomb of the princess
Anck-es-en-Amon was hidden.

301
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,157
Partly inference, partly chance.

302
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,554
Sir Joseph, you seem disturbed.

303
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,714
Yes. A tragedy at the museum
after you left.

304
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,275
Tragedy?

305
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,351
When I was there...

306
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,350
When you were there, Miss Grosvenor?

307
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,959
Yes. They told me I went there
and tried to get in after it was closed.

308
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,190
I don't remember, but...

309
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,271
Helen, it is very late.

310
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,554
Frank, will you please
see Helen back to the hotel?

311
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,349
- Certainly, if Miss Grosvenor will let me.
- I don't want to go.

312
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,997
After what happened, you need rest badly.

313
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:43,757
But I don't. I was tired, but...

314
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,796
Why, I've never felt so alive before!

315
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,758
- As your doctor, I must order you to go.
- I'm not a child.

316
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,831
Yes, please come.

317
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,829
Then, Ardath Bey, <i>au revoir.</i>

318
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,911
We must see each other again.

319
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,351
I shall be honoured.

320
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:24,680
An unusual crime. A guard killed
by a man who left a gift to the museum.

321
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,751
- A gift?
- A scroll.

322
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,517
Part of which was transcribed
when it was first found.

323
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,636
Here is the transcription.

324
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,037
I cannot read the writing
of a period so remote.

325
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,032
But you read "Anck-es-en-Amon"
on that piece of pottery.

326
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,111
That was of the 18th dynasty.

327
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,714
These are pre-dynastic ideographs.

328
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,076
The scroll from which this
was copied was stolen ten years ago,

329
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,152
together with the mummy
of the high priest Imhotep.

330
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,390
Most interesting.

331
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,438
May I see that scroll, Sir Joseph?

332
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,872
We left it at the... museum.

333
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,032
- So.
- I have something else to show you.

334
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,911
A photograph.

335
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,871
Why do you show all this to me?

336
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,952
Do you think it conceivable
that the mummy was not stolen,

337
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,998
but given a semblance
of life by the spell of the scroll.

338
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:24,038
That scroll is my property.
I bought it from a dealer.

339
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,999
It is here in this house.
I presume, in that room.

340
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,475
We had foreseen this.

341
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,596
The scroll is in safe hands.

342
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,356
It will be destroyed the minute
it is known that harm has come to us.

343
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,638
You have studied our ancient arts,
and you know that you cannot harm me.

344
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,156
You also know that you must
return that scroll to me or die.

345
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:55,235
Now tell that weak fool
to get that scroll, wherever it is,

346
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,437
and hand it to his Nubian servant.

347
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,998
- The Nubian!
- The ancient blood.

348
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,236
So you have made him your slave.

349
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:14,831
If I could get my hands on you,
I'd break your dried flesh to pieces.

350
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,590
But your power is too strong.

351
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,957
This is the evil force
that has been attacking her.

352
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,838
Burn the scroll, man. Burn it!

353
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,037
It was through you
this horror came into existence.

354
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,510
It's true. It's true.

355
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:49,470
Your father destroyed the scroll,
knowing that it would cost him his life.

356
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,716
What's that?

357
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,477
Isis. The Egyptian symbol of life.
I meant it for your father.

358
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,154
What good could
that old charm have done him?

359
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,878
I tell you, the doctors say
it's plainly heart failure.

360
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,871
The Nubian is missing.

361
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,793
He's an old servant. He's frightened.

362
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,871
He'll be back.

363
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,594
Don't try and make me believe that this
Ardath fellow is a mummy come to life.

364
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,148
That idea, and the horror of it,
killed my father.

365
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,755
The museum guard
died of natural causes, too.

366
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,990
Frank, I need your help.

367
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,789
I saw your attraction
to my patient last night, and hers to you.

368
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,470
- Hers to me? Do you really think so?
- And I welcomed it.

369
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,348
But do you think I have a chance?
Cos I think she's the most won...

370
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,909
- Oh, but this is terrible at a time like this...
- Frank, I'm afraid.

371
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,596
- Will you go with me to her now?
- Yes.

372
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,195
Then telephone her first,
not to leave the hotel.

373
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,391
9590.

374
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,231
No. I'm not going out.

375
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,276
Yes. I promise to wait until you get here.

376
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,395
Goodbye. And I'm so dreadfully sorry.

377
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,910
What were you doing, Doctor?

378
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,673
Your father did not burn
the Scroll of Thoth.

379
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,115
That creature has it now.

380
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,953
- The ashes in the fireplace!
- They were newspaper.

381
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,996
The scroll is papyrus.

382
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,640
Then it was murder? The Nubian!

383
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,671
Wear this around your neck.

384
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,559
- Why?
- When we fight this creature,

385
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,189
we must ask protection
from the forces of all that it defied.

386
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,114
- I'll give it to Helen. She needs protection.
- No, her life is not in danger.

387
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,952
It is her soul.

388
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,113
Should love for you come to her,
he will try to destroy you.

389
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,751
That amulet, the Egyptians believed,
was a charm against evil sendings,

390
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,035
such as struck down your father.

391
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,989
Your dog is frightened.

392
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,275
My servant will see to him.

393
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,071
Sit down, Miss Grosvenor.

394
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,109
Ancient Egypt.

395
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,191
Nothing modern.

396
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,915
What a strange incense.

397
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,991
Is it not familiar to you?

398
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,919
- No.
- Our forefathers used it.

399
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,228
Yours and mine.

400
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,318
You will not remember
what I show you now,

401
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:34,836
and yet I shall awaken memories
of love and crime and death.

402
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,149
<i> I knelt by the bed of death.</i>

403
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,637
<i>Thy father's last farewell.</i>

404
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,797
<i>I knew the Scroll of Thoth</i>
<i>could bring thee back to life.</i>

405
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:14,159
<i>I dared the god's anger, and stole it.</i>

406
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,348
<i>I stole back to thy tomb</i>
<i>to bring thee back to life.</i>

407
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,318
<i>I murmured the spell that raises the dead.</i>

408
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,469
<i>They broke in upon me</i>
<i>and found me doing an unholy thing.</i>

409
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,752
<i>Thy father condemned me</i>
<i>to the nameless death.</i>

410
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,717
<i>The scroll he ordered buried with me,</i>

411
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,110
<i>that no such sacrilege</i>
<i>might disgrace Egypt again.</i>

412
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:02,231
<i>A nameless grave. The slaves were killed</i>
<i>so that none should know.</i>

413
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,391
<i>The soldiers who killed them</i>
<i>were also slain,</i>

414
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,391
<i>so no friend could creep to the desert</i>

415
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,790
<i>with funeral offerings</i>
<i>for my condemned spirit.</i>

416
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,591
Anck-es-en-Amon.

417
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,990
My love has lasted longer
than the temples of our gods.

418
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,594
No man ever suffered as I did for you.

419
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,789
The rest you may not know.

420
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:40,000
Not until you are about to pass through
the great night of terror and triumph,

421
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:44,278
until you are ready to face moments
of horror for an eternity of love,

422
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,479
until I send back
your spirit, that has wandered

423
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,472
through so many forms
and so many ages.

424
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,872
But, before then,
Bast must again send forth death.

425
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,510
Death to that boy for whom
love is creeping into your heart.

426
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,229
Love that would keep you from myself.

427
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,748
Love that might bring
sickness and even death to you.

428
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,791
Awake.

429
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,711
Have I been asleep?

430
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,235
I had strange dreams.

431
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,750
Dreams of ancient Egypt, I think.
There was someone like you in them.

432
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,195
My pool is sometimes troubled.

433
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,671
One sees strange fantasies in the water.
But they pass like dreams.

434
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,231
My dog! Wolfram! Wolfram!

435
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,311
Where is he?

436
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,471
Helen.

437
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,709
Helen! Where have you been?

438
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,112
We've been so worried.
We've hunted everywhere.

439
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,191
- In the museum again?
- Yes.

440
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,316
Muller's down in the Arab quarter now.

441
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,312
Well, if I must give an explanation,
it was stuffy in here.

442
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:18,349
I can't be shut up all the time. And I don't
like the feeling I'm always being watched.

443
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,113
- I took the dog with me.
- Where is the dog?

444
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,836
He's dead.

445
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,229
- But how?
- I don't know.

446
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,993
- Well, where?
- I don't remember.

447
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,871
But I can see it now.

448
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,110
Standing on poor Wolfram's back.

449
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,236
- A white cat.
- A white cat?

450
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,356
The cat-goddess Bast!

451
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,229
Yes, there was a statue of Bast.

452
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,311
The goddess of evil sendings!

453
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,834
Just what happened?
Try to remember, Helen!

454
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,435
I don't want to remember. Besides,
I don't see it's any affair of yours.

455
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,476
Oh, but it is.

456
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,755
We know that you were with Ardath Bey.

457
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,396
Oh, Helen. Helen, I love you.

458
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,199
I'm trying to help you
and protect you. We all are.

459
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:18,114
Don't let me go again.
I'll try to get away, but you mustn't let me.

460
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,720
No matter what I do or what I say.

461
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,791
There's death there for me.

462
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,156
And life for something else
inside me that isn't me.

463
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,312
But it's alive too, and fighting for life.

464
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,470
Save me from it, Frank. Save me.

465
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,915
Oh, everything's going to be all right.

466
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,470
Now that you've asked for help,
I'll never leave you alone.

467
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:42,678
I'll get Mrs Muller down here with you,
and I'll stay here till the doctor comes.

468
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,751
Then, we'll take you to my house.

469
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,717
Oh, Helen. It's been such torture.

470
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,351
I love you so.

471
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:57,869
I don't like that doctor. Please go in there
and find out what he's saying about me.

472
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:01,953
I will, my dear. He'll know just
what's the matter with you and cure you.

473
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,031
Now, don't worry.

474
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,037
Now, Miss Farthing, help me
to get dressed and get out of here.

475
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:16,875
- Come over you again, Miss Grosvenor?
- I must escape. I'm being held. Help me.

476
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,554
You told me, when
these fits came on I wasn't to listen.

477
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,552
I have a friend. He's rich.
He'll give you money.

478
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,438
Now you just lie down again.
You know you mustn't get up.

479
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,670
If you don't want money,
what do you want most?

480
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,309
He'll give you anything,
if only you'll help me to go to him.

481
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,868
Do you want me to call Dr Muller?

482
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,270
- No. I hate him.
- Mr Whemple, then?

483
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,471
I'll die if I don't get away from him!

484
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,676
- Now, Miss Grosvenor.
- It's killing me!

485
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,955
Now, Helen, you must not do this again.

486
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,474
You're always so exhausted afterwards.

487
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,114
She's too weak to be removed
except to a hospital.

488
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,112
I insist on keeping her here
under our direct observation.

489
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,556
But, Doctor, you haven't told us what
to do. She gets weaker every day.

490
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:03,236
You know that negligée I bought in Paris?
Help me to put it on.

491
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:06,756
And bring me my toilet things.
I want some colour. I want to look well.

492
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,990
You can't, my dear. They'd never allow it.

493
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,878
- The nurse would be sure...
- I know. We'll get rid of her.

494
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:15,635
This is a plot, just between us.
I want to look the way I did.

495
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,597
Just a surprise, for Frank.

496
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,558
And I want you to bring him to me.
You understand?

497
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,313
In short, I have failed to make a diagnosis.

498
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,278
Medical science is helpless
in a case like this.

499
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,871
Frank.

500
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,315
Go to her, and don't be angry with me.
I couldn't resist her.

501
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,751
Helen, you shouldn't have done this.
They shouldn't have let you.

502
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,718
Just this once. Perhaps the last time.

503
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,634
But you're going to get well.
Then I know I can make you love me.

504
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,711
I know I can make you happy.

505
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:58,195
I do love you, Frank.
And I'm trying to prove it,

506
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,794
because I'd rather die
than live and lose you.

507
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,437
But you're going to live.
We're not going to lose each other.

508
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,070
- So, my dear. You...
- Don't scold me.

509
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,869
Just feminine vanity.
I wanted to look my best again.

510
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,269
So you know more
than I realised you knew.

511
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:18,558
- What do you mean?
- These impulses to go to him.

512
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,438
The pull is too strong
to withstand and live.

513
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,511
I am so glad you understand.

514
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,633
Helen knows. She knows
the moment she stops struggling,

515
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,075
he will give her back
her strength to come to him.

516
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:34,711
But I don't want to lose my own mind
and be someone else. Someone I hate.

517
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:40,477
My dear, while you were growing worse,
we tried to find him and failed.

518
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:43,438
The next time the call comes, go to him.

519
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,436
Muller, what can we do now?

520
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,876
We can do no more.
Ardath has beaten me.

521
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,758
The next time he draws her to him,
we must follow her.

522
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,718
- And then?
- We will destroy him.

523
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,995
I've given her some bromide.
She's asleep now. I'll go to bed.

524
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,958
- All right. I'll wait till Dr Muller comes.
- Good night.

525
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,031
Good night.

526
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,196
Where are we?

527
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:32,353
This is my bed, but this is not the temple,
nor my father's palace.

528
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,908
Do not look, Anck-es-en-Amon.

529
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,991
Do not be afraid.

530
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:44,472
I was afraid. When you knelt beside my
bed, a veil came over my eyes. Darkness.

531
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:47,791
Your last memory is of me
in the hour of your death

532
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:52,431
as I knelt by your bed, 3700 years ago.

533
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:57,116
No man has ever suffered
for woman as you suffered for me.

534
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,996
- Now that the gods have forgiven us...
- No, no, not yet.

535
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,031
Your soul is in a mortal body,

536
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:08,516
renewed many times
since we loved in Thebes of old.

537
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:14,152
But that love is not for us again
until the great change.

538
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,231
I do not understand.

539
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,231
Look.

540
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:38,079
- Look and wonder.
- A figure of myself.

541
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,392
It is my coffin,
made by my father against my death.

542
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,634
What mummy has usurped
my eternal resting place?

543
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:49,713
It is thy dead shell.
I tried then to raise this body.

544
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:54,351
I could raise it now, but it would be
a mere thing that moved at my will,

545
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,431
without a soul.

546
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,636
It was not only this body
that I loved, it was thy soul.

547
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:38,553
I destroy this lifeless thing.

548
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,632
Thou shalt take its place
but for a few moments,

549
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:45,918
and then rise again,
even as I have risen.

550
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,471
Come.

551
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:31,270
Imhotep, this is the place of embalming.

552
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:36,951
It is not lawful for me, a priestess of Isis,
to see or touch an unclean thing.

553
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:41,117
Come to the altar of Anubis,
the guide of the dead.

554
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:54,235
The time has come for the final prayer.

555
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,911
What have I to do with Anubis?

556
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:04,517
The ancient rites
must be performed over thy body.

557
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,836
Then I will read
the great spell with which

558
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:10,356
Isis brought Osiris back from the grave.

559
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,635
And thou shalt rise again.

560
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,031
No.

561
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,998
No, I'm alive! I'm young!

562
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,150
I won't die!

563
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:23,277
I loved you once,
but now you belong with the dead.

564
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,515
I am Anck-es-en-Amon, but I...

565
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,275
I'm somebody else too.

566
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,954
I want to live,
even in a strange new worid.

567
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,032
For thy sake I was buried alive.

568
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:41,672
I ask of thee only a moment of agony.
Only so can we be united.

569
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,271
The bath of natron.

570
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:51,878
You shall not plunge my body into that.

571
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,996
Let the deed be done.

572
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,114
Let me go. Let me go!

573
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,158
Don't kill me! I'm a priestess of Isis.

574
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,800
Save me from that mummy! It's dead!

575
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,471
Save me!

576
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:48,035
I no longer fear you.
Do with me what you will.

577
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,036
Frank.

578
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:08,350
Frank!

579
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:11,238
She has gone to him.
They must be in the museum.

580
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,710
Now I know his horrible plan.

581
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:19,434
He is going to kill her, and
make her a living mummy like himself.

582
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:36,476
The gods will receive into the underworid
the spirit of Anck-es-en-Amon.

583
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,431
But not for long.

584
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:43,756
Osiris will release thy soul.

585
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:01,998
You shall rest from life,
like the setting sun in the west.

586
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,196
But you shall dawn anew in the east,

587
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:08,353
as the first rays of Amon-Ra
dispel the shadow.

588
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,911
Look! What's that?

589
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,838
Come on.

590
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,751
Anck-es-en-Amon.

591
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:39,109
Frank! Frank!

592
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:50,757
Helen! Helen!

593
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:53,954
Helen.

594
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,957
O Isis, holy maiden.
I was thy consecrated vestal.

595
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,349
I broke my vows. Save me now!

596
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:08,876
Teach me the ancient summons,
the holy spells I've forgotten.

597
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,951
I call upon thee as of old!

598
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,391
Helen!

599
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,914
Call her. He has dragged her
back to ancient Egypt.

600
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,231
Call her! Her love for you
may bridge the centuries.

601
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:18,317
Helen. Helen!

602
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,595
Come back. It's Frank.

603
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,831
Come back.
