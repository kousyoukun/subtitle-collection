1
00:02:12,264 --> 00:02:15,965
Trying to teach me
a lesson in patience, Sir Joseph?

2
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,184
Method is everything in archaeology.

3
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,763
We always deal with
our finds of the day in order.

4
00:02:20,858 --> 00:02:23,694
Well, it seems to me
that that box we dug up today,

5
00:02:23,778 --> 00:02:26,448
with the very peculiar
gentleman over there,

6
00:02:26,531 --> 00:02:28,821
is the only find we've made in two months

7
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:32,196
that'll bring this expedition
medals from the British Museum.

8
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:35,374
We didn't come
to dig in Egypt for medals.

9
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,033
Much more is learned
from bits of broken pottery

10
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:40,455
than from all the sensational finds.

11
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:43,800
Our job is to increase
the sum of human knowledge of the past,

12
00:02:43,886 --> 00:02:45,844
not to satisfy our own curiosity.

13
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,976
Oh, that's all very true, Sir Joseph,
but, after all, we're human.

14
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,395
- And a find like this! How can you wait?
- This is your first trip.

15
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:56,981
I've been here ten years. I'm more
curious about the mummy than you.

16
00:02:57,069 --> 00:02:59,228
And even more about that box.

17
00:02:59,322 --> 00:03:01,149
- Whemple.
- Yes?

18
00:03:01,574 --> 00:03:03,366
The viscera were not removed.

19
00:03:03,452 --> 00:03:06,703
The usual scar made
by the embalmer's knife is not there.

20
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:08,367
I guessed as much, Muller.

21
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,878
I had a good look at him
when I photographed him.

22
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:19,294
Never saw a mummy like that.

23
00:03:19,388 --> 00:03:21,880
Neither, I imagine, has anyone else.

24
00:03:21,975 --> 00:03:26,554
Looks as though he died in some
sensationally unpleasant manner.

25
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:32,523
The contorted muscles show
that he struggled in the bandages.

26
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,689
Buried alive?

27
00:03:37,744 --> 00:03:40,033
"Imhotep".

28
00:03:40,122 --> 00:03:44,785
"High Priest of
the Temple of the Sun at Karnak".

29
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:50,080
Poor old fella. Now, what could you have
done to make 'em treat you like that?

30
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:52,584
An execution for treason, I suppose.

31
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:56,012
Sacrilege, more likely.

32
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,308
Look. Sacred spells which protect
the soul in its journey to the underworld

33
00:04:01,398 --> 00:04:03,687
have been chipped off the coffin.

34
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:08,154
So Imhotep was sentenced to death
not only in this world, but in the next.

35
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,823
Maybe he got too gay
with the vestal virgins in the temple.

36
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:16,574
Possibly. The priestesses of the Temple
of Karnak were daughters of the Pharaoh.

37
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:18,743
They were the secret virgins of Isis.

38
00:04:19,378 --> 00:04:22,250
Maybe the answer's
in that box we found buried with him.

39
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,675
I see I shall get no more work
out of you until after it's open.

40
00:04:25,761 --> 00:04:29,380
- Come on.
- Let's have the box.

41
00:04:30,809 --> 00:04:34,510
Oh dear. The wood's so rotten
it'll fall apart at a touch.

42
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:37,389
Whatever it is, it's terribly heavy.

43
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:48,613
Metal. Looks like copper.

44
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,417
It's gold.

45
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:02,586
I say. Look here.

46
00:05:03,057 --> 00:05:06,593
The unbroken seals
of the Pharaoh Amenophis.

47
00:05:07,104 --> 00:05:09,180
Some temple treasure.

48
00:05:33,302 --> 00:05:41,646
"Death, eternal punishment, for...
anyone... who... opens... this... casket."

49
00:05:43,148 --> 00:05:47,775
"In the name of Amon-Ra,
the king of the gods."

50
00:05:49,531 --> 00:05:51,820
Good heavens, what a terrible curse!

51
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:55,198
- Well, let's see what's inside!
- Wait!

52
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,958
You will break the curse.

53
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:01,790
We recognise your mastery
of the occult sciences, Muller.

54
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:04,371
But your beliefs can't
interfere with my work.

55
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:08,085
- Then why did you send for me today?
- As a friend and an expert.

56
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:10,884
This find was unique
and I wanted your opinion.

57
00:06:10,974 --> 00:06:13,761
- It's providential that you did.
- Oh, come, Dr Muller.

58
00:06:13,852 --> 00:06:17,803
Surely a few thousand years in the earth
take the mumbo jumbo off any old curse.

59
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:19,892
Oh, I cannot speak before a boy.

60
00:06:20,652 --> 00:06:22,895
Come out under the stars of Egypt.

61
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:27,026
Do not touch that casket.

62
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:34,459
Go on with your cataloguing.
We'll open it later.

63
00:06:34,544 --> 00:06:36,952
Don't think you can
persuade me not to examine

64
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:40,749
the most wonderful find
of my whole experience out here.

65
00:06:50,731 --> 00:06:55,608
If you are right about the legend, then this
casket may contain the Scroll of Thoth,

66
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:59,694
from the holy of holies in the temple, and
I can hardly wait to get back to find out.

67
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:03,699
The gods of Egypt still live in these
hills, in their ruined temples.

68
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:07,123
The ancient spells are weaker,
but some of them are still potent.

69
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:10,626
And I believe that you have
in your hut the Scroll of Thoth itself,

70
00:07:10,714 --> 00:07:14,546
which contains the great spell with which
Isis raised Osiris from the dead.

71
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:25,037
Put it back. Bury it where you found it.

72
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:28,249
You have read the curse. You dare defy
it?

73
00:09:28,508 --> 00:09:32,008
In the interests of science,
even if I believed in the curse,

74
00:09:32,095 --> 00:09:34,385
I'd go on with my work for the museum.

75
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,890
Come back with me and we'll
examine this great find together.

76
00:09:38,061 --> 00:09:41,680
I cannot condone
an act of sacrilege with my presence.

77
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,830
What's the matter, man?
For heaven's sakes, what is it?

78
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,674
He... He went for a little walk!

79
00:11:47,804 --> 00:11:50,093
You should have seen his face!

80
00:12:41,536 --> 00:12:45,321
Here's something to break the monotony.
A visitor coming from the Nile.

81
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:48,750
- Colour? Nationality?
- How could I see in that glare?

82
00:12:48,837 --> 00:12:51,163
Well, Whemple, back we go to London.

83
00:12:51,257 --> 00:12:56,465
And what fools we look. Money wasted.
Hole after hole dug in this blasted desert.

84
00:12:57,097 --> 00:12:59,174
A few beads. A few broken pots.

85
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,176
A man needs more
than hard work for this game.

86
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,770
He needs flair.
He needs luck. Like your father.

87
00:13:05,858 --> 00:13:08,694
When he came here,
there wasn't so much competition.

88
00:13:08,778 --> 00:13:14,734
When he did, he found things. And once,
ten years ago, he found too much.

89
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:19,953
Was it ten years? Queer story, that young
Oxford chap he had with him going mad.

90
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:22,118
- You know what I think it was?
- No. What?

91
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:26,839
He went crazy. Bored beyond human
endurance in this sand and these rocks.

92
00:13:26,925 --> 00:13:32,051
He was laughing when your father found
him. He died laughing, in a straitjacket.

93
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,133
Your father never explained.

94
00:13:34,226 --> 00:13:38,854
But when the best excavator England
has turned out, a man who loved Egypt,

95
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,310
said he'd never come back here,
that meant something.

96
00:13:48,243 --> 00:13:50,320
Come in.

97
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,544
You break your season's camp,
Professor Pearson?

98
00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:05,127
Your colleagues
have returned to London?

99
00:14:05,222 --> 00:14:08,888
Yes. Whemple and I
stayed behind to clear up.

100
00:14:08,977 --> 00:14:11,765
Your expedition has not been a success.

101
00:14:11,856 --> 00:14:15,854
Scarcely.
Here are the season's finds.

102
00:14:16,236 --> 00:14:20,021
Permit me to present you
with the most sensational find

103
00:14:20,116 --> 00:14:22,441
since that of Tutankhamen.

104
00:14:22,535 --> 00:14:25,157
This is very sporting of you!
May I ask why?

105
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:30,040
We Egyptians are not permitted
to dig up our ancient dead.

106
00:14:30,128 --> 00:14:33,046
Only... foreign museums.

107
00:14:34,467 --> 00:14:35,926
What's this?

108
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:40,139
Part of the funerary equipment
of the princess Anck-es-en-Amon.

109
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:45,014
- Daughter of Amenophis the Magnificent.
- Yes. It's her name.

110
00:14:45,105 --> 00:14:49,269
I found that not 100 yards
from where we are.

111
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,489
- You mean you think her tomb is there?
- I will show you where to dig.

112
00:14:55,242 --> 00:14:59,193
I'm sure it's very good of you, Mr...?
I didn't catch your name.

113
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:01,365
Ardath Bey.

114
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:21,680
Circumstantial evidence.
Not very strong, perhaps.

115
00:15:21,775 --> 00:15:24,776
But if we put that gang
of diggers from Kerma on the job,

116
00:15:24,862 --> 00:15:27,733
we can tell in two days
if there's anything here.

117
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:29,651
In one day, Professor.

118
00:16:12,462 --> 00:16:15,463
- It's a step.
- He was right.

119
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:17,626
Anyhow, we've found something.

120
00:16:41,623 --> 00:16:46,167
- The name of Anck-es-en-Amon.
- We will cable your father in London.

121
00:16:46,253 --> 00:16:49,125
He must be here when
we examine this great find.

122
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,464
The seal of the seven jackals.

123
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,681
And it's unbroken.

124
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:03,681
No one has entered this door since the
priests of the royal acropolis sealed it.

125
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,899
3700 years ago.

126
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:53,530
Is there a view like this
in all the world, Helen?

127
00:18:53,618 --> 00:18:55,695
The real Egypt.

128
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:04,255
Are we really in
this dreadful modern Cairo?

129
00:19:05,132 --> 00:19:08,549
Your thoughts are far from the dance
and these nice English boys.

130
00:19:08,636 --> 00:19:11,175
Not really. I'm having a lovely time.

131
00:19:11,265 --> 00:19:13,388
- I'm so grateful.
- But why?

132
00:19:13,476 --> 00:19:15,599
Your keeping me here with you, of
course.

133
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:19,436
So I don't have to go up to Father
in that beastly hot Sudan.

134
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,235
It's I who am grateful.
My most interesting patient.

135
00:19:29,537 --> 00:19:31,614
Know who that is?

136
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,749
- Muller of Vienna.
- Really?

137
00:19:34,835 --> 00:19:39,000
Always spends his winters here.
Authority on Egyptian occult.

138
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:41,333
- Yes, but the girl?
- Helen Grosvenor.

139
00:19:41,427 --> 00:19:45,675
Her father's governor of the Sudan.
English, of course. Her mother, Egyptian.

140
00:19:45,765 --> 00:19:49,930
Some old family with a tree a mile long.
She's staying here with Dr and Mrs Muller.

141
00:20:03,454 --> 00:20:06,028
Pardon me, sir. Our closing bell has rung.

142
00:20:06,124 --> 00:20:07,998
I did not notice the time.

143
00:20:09,753 --> 00:20:12,505
- I am addressing Sir Joseph Whemple?
- Yes.

144
00:20:13,341 --> 00:20:16,342
- I am Ardath Bey.
- Indeed!

145
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,889
Why, we have you to thank
that we have this exhibit here at all.

146
00:20:22,978 --> 00:20:26,182
The museum should be kept open
all night in your honour.

147
00:20:26,273 --> 00:20:30,023
Won't you come down to my office?
I'm working here late.

148
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:32,354
Your pardon. I dislike to be touched.

149
00:20:33,073 --> 00:20:35,150
An Eastern prejudice.

150
00:20:44,045 --> 00:20:46,122
Won't you sit down?

151
00:20:48,718 --> 00:20:50,794
You know my son?

152
00:20:53,473 --> 00:20:57,424
Ardath Bey. Where did you disappear
to when we opened the tomb?

153
00:20:57,812 --> 00:21:00,101
I returned to Cairo.

154
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:03,524
But... but now I must not detain you.

155
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,070
But I must see you again.
You must come to my house.

156
00:21:07,157 --> 00:21:10,741
I regret I am too occupied
to accept invitations.

157
00:21:18,379 --> 00:21:20,705
He's a strange one.

158
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,714
You might have thanked him. He was
responsible for finding the princess.

159
00:21:24,804 --> 00:21:26,797
Yes. I rather wish he hadn't been.

160
00:21:26,889 --> 00:21:29,927
It's a dirty trick,
Cairo Museum keeping what we've found.

161
00:21:30,018 --> 00:21:34,978
That was the contract. The British
Museum works for science, not for loot.

162
00:22:15,866 --> 00:22:17,943
Anck-es-en-Amon.

163
00:22:19,704 --> 00:22:23,241
Anck-es-en-Amon.

164
00:22:25,461 --> 00:22:27,538
Is anything the matter?

165
00:22:32,345 --> 00:22:34,172
Anck-es-en-Amon.

166
00:22:52,161 --> 00:22:53,988
Anck-es-en-Amon.

167
00:23:20,487 --> 00:23:22,979
Where do you want to go, miss?

168
00:23:23,074 --> 00:23:25,826
Le musée des Antiquités.

169
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:28,446
Le musée des Antiquités.

170
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,537
Imhotep.

171
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,624
Anck-es-en-Amon.

172
00:23:38,426 --> 00:23:39,885
Anck-es-en-Amon.

173
00:23:40,303 --> 00:23:42,546
Imhotep.

174
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:46,970
Imhotep.

175
00:24:16,598 --> 00:24:17,843
I must get in.

176
00:24:18,183 --> 00:24:19,843
Anck-es-en-Amon.

177
00:24:19,935 --> 00:24:22,890
- I must!
- It's closed for the night. They've gone.

178
00:24:22,981 --> 00:24:25,057
I must get in.

179
00:24:45,508 --> 00:24:49,507
Imhotep. Imhotep.

180
00:24:54,895 --> 00:24:56,971
Imhotep.

181
00:24:57,815 --> 00:25:02,359
What's she saying?

182
00:25:02,738 --> 00:25:05,146
What language is that?

183
00:25:05,658 --> 00:25:10,487
The language of ancient Egypt.
Not heard on this earth for 2000 years.

184
00:25:13,334 --> 00:25:17,664
And the name of a man unspoken
since before the siege of Troy.

185
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:06,351
- Is your master at home?
- Yes, sir.

186
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:09,277
Tell him Dr Muller wishes
to see him urgently.

187
00:26:16,328 --> 00:26:20,279
- How did I get here?
- We brought you here. Father and I.

188
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:22,451
You fainted.

189
00:26:26,883 --> 00:26:28,959
But how did you guess she was here?

190
00:26:29,052 --> 00:26:32,588
I discovered that she took a taxi
from the hotel to the museum.

191
00:26:32,681 --> 00:26:36,134
I went there. The watchman said
she had left in your car.

192
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:43,226
Before you take her away, I must talk
to you about something she said just now.

193
00:26:50,203 --> 00:26:54,154
- Oh, Dr Muller.
- Oh, here you are, my dear.

194
00:26:55,126 --> 00:26:57,582
I suppose you introduced yourself?

195
00:26:57,671 --> 00:27:03,544
No? Miss Helen Grosvenor, my old friend
Sir Joseph Whemple, Frank Whemple.

196
00:27:03,636 --> 00:27:06,840
That seems so formal under
these peculiar circumstances.

197
00:27:06,932 --> 00:27:10,218
And now, if you're all right again,
back we go to the hotel.

198
00:27:10,311 --> 00:27:13,182
I think she'll want to rest a few minutes.

199
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:19,691
Frank, will you make yourself agreeable?

200
00:27:25,037 --> 00:27:26,698
Well...

201
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,542
Where was I when I fainted, Mr Whemple?

202
00:27:29,626 --> 00:27:34,289
- Oh, outside the museum.
- What was I doing there?

203
00:27:34,382 --> 00:27:37,834
Well, I wouldn't know that, would I?

204
00:27:37,928 --> 00:27:42,342
No, I don't suppose you would.
I wish I did.

205
00:27:42,434 --> 00:27:44,510
- I was waiting...
- Don't talk about it.

206
00:27:44,603 --> 00:27:46,680
Oh, right.

207
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:55,440
- You're partly Egyptian, aren't you?
- Yes.

208
00:27:55,533 --> 00:27:57,610
How did you guess that?

209
00:27:58,328 --> 00:28:02,030
Well, I don't know.
Just something about you.

210
00:28:03,376 --> 00:28:05,868
I'd have liked Egypt better
if I'd met you there.

211
00:28:05,963 --> 00:28:10,293
No such luck! Stuck in the desert
for two months, and was it hot!

212
00:28:10,385 --> 00:28:12,544
- That tomb.
- What tomb?

213
00:28:13,972 --> 00:28:16,511
Surely you read about the princess?

214
00:28:16,601 --> 00:28:18,594
- So you did that?
- Yes.

215
00:28:18,687 --> 00:28:21,641
The 14 steps down
and the unbroken seals were thrilling.

216
00:28:21,732 --> 00:28:26,146
But when we came to handle all her clothes,
her jewels and her toilet things...

217
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:28,907
They buried everything
with them they used in life.

218
00:28:28,991 --> 00:28:33,120
- When we came to unwrap the girl...
- How could you do that?

219
00:28:33,204 --> 00:28:35,743
Had to! Science, you know!

220
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:40,045
Well, after we'd worked among her things,
I felt as if I'd known her.

221
00:28:40,881 --> 00:28:44,713
But when we got the wrappings off,
and I saw her face...

222
00:28:44,802 --> 00:28:48,338
You'll think me silly,
but I sort of fell in love with her.

223
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:53,224
Do you have to open graves
to find girls to fall in love with?

224
00:28:55,816 --> 00:29:00,229
I say. Now I know what it is about you.

225
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,159
There was something about her head...

226
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:08,656
I had never mentioned the name,
yet I heard Miss Grosvenor

227
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:12,118
mutter in ancient Egyptian
something about Imhotep.

228
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:14,287
Imhotep?

229
00:29:18,343 --> 00:29:20,882
What was this Ardath
doing in the museum?

230
00:29:22,014 --> 00:29:25,099
Looking at the mummy.
Just at closing time.

231
00:29:28,731 --> 00:29:30,356
Hello?

232
00:29:30,441 --> 00:29:32,518
What?

233
00:29:33,487 --> 00:29:35,563
II est mort?

234
00:29:37,533 --> 00:29:39,361
Tout de suite, effendi.

235
00:29:40,662 --> 00:29:44,447
Come. A museum guard found dead
in the room with the princess.

236
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,013
Fear. Fear.

237
00:29:59,102 --> 00:30:01,344
So he died of shock.

238
00:30:01,438 --> 00:30:04,012
We find this in dead guard's hand,
Sir Joseph.

239
00:30:04,108 --> 00:30:08,403
Probably thief tried to steal it.
Guard take it away, thief kill him.

240
00:30:09,573 --> 00:30:12,491
The cause of death, I not find nothing.

241
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:16,988
Looks like an attempted theft, but
nothing stolen here could be sold.

242
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:19,158
What is the document?

243
00:30:41,612 --> 00:30:44,234
Let me put this here.
You'll be more comfortable.

244
00:30:44,324 --> 00:30:46,780
Thanks.

245
00:30:46,868 --> 00:30:50,867
You really want to know why
I didn't take you to the hospital?

246
00:30:50,957 --> 00:30:55,252
- Because, when I held you in my arms...
- Hadn't you better not commit yourself?

247
00:30:55,337 --> 00:30:59,418
What girl could not make a conquest who
collapsed at a man's feet in moonlight?

248
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:04,468
It seems absurd when we've known each
other such a short time, but I'm serious.

249
00:31:04,557 --> 00:31:06,930
Haven't I had enough
excitement for one evening,

250
00:31:07,018 --> 00:31:10,470
without the additional thrill
of a strange man making love to me?

251
00:31:10,564 --> 00:31:13,899
But I've never been serious
about this sort of thing before.

252
00:31:13,985 --> 00:31:19,028
Now, look here. You can tell me to go
to the devil, but you can't laugh at me.

253
00:31:25,165 --> 00:31:30,125
The curse has struck her, and now,
through her, it will strike my son.

254
00:31:30,213 --> 00:31:32,005
Quiet.

255
00:31:32,216 --> 00:31:35,716
Frank, will you come
to your father's study?

256
00:31:35,804 --> 00:31:38,591
Helen, I shall take you home presently.

257
00:31:42,562 --> 00:31:44,638
I'll be back in a minute.

258
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,621
Imhotep was alive
when that mummy in the museum

259
00:31:58,707 --> 00:32:00,581
was a vestal virgin in the temple.

260
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:03,954
3700 years ago!
What's that got to do with us now?

261
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,372
Your assistant who went insane and died,

262
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,755
as you might have
if you'd seen what he saw,

263
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:11,762
made a transcription of
part of that scroll.

264
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:14,684
Yes. I have it still.

265
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:19,514
You seem to think it has all the devils of
hell in it. Burn it and be done with it.

266
00:32:19,607 --> 00:32:21,684
An excellent suggestion.

267
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:24,645
What became of the mummy of Imhotep?

268
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,317
Somebody stole it!

269
00:32:29,453 --> 00:32:31,991
Look, what's the matter
with Miss Grosvenor?

270
00:32:32,081 --> 00:32:35,498
You still think that
that mummy was stolen, Sir Joseph?

271
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:41,333
Yes. I... I really don't know.

272
00:34:00,731 --> 00:34:04,018
A thousand pardons. I am Ardath Bey.

273
00:34:08,157 --> 00:34:10,234
I am Helen Grosvenor.

274
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:13,446
I called to see Sir Joseph.

275
00:34:14,916 --> 00:34:18,748
- He's in the study.
- In conference?

276
00:34:18,837 --> 00:34:20,914
If I might perhaps wait?

277
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,922
Yes. Of course.

278
00:34:31,185 --> 00:34:34,436
Have we not met before, Miss Grosvenor?

279
00:34:34,523 --> 00:34:37,975
No. I don't think so.

280
00:34:39,571 --> 00:34:43,439
I don't think one would forget
meeting you, Ardath Bey.

281
00:34:43,534 --> 00:34:45,610
Then I am mistaken.

282
00:34:47,122 --> 00:34:49,245
But you are of our blood.

283
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:51,409
As to that, I am not mistaken.

284
00:34:52,587 --> 00:34:57,048
Yes. My mother was Egyptian.

285
00:34:57,301 --> 00:34:59,792
You must burn the Scroll of Thoth!

286
00:34:59,887 --> 00:35:03,589
I tell you,
it's the museum's property, not mine.

287
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,926
Who's out there with Miss Grosvenor?

288
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:13,232
Ardath Bey!

289
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:15,397
He's come for the scroll.

290
00:35:37,976 --> 00:35:40,514
Ardath Bey, Dr Muller.

291
00:35:42,565 --> 00:35:48,189
I accept your invitation. But I find
no solitary student with his books.

292
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,357
I fear my visit is inopportune.

293
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:53,617
On the contrary.
We were just talking about...

294
00:35:53,703 --> 00:35:55,827
- Me?
- Your native Egypt.

295
00:35:56,874 --> 00:35:59,496
You know Miss Grosvenor?

296
00:35:59,586 --> 00:36:02,256
Ardath Bey introduced himself.

297
00:36:04,133 --> 00:36:06,209
Won't you be seated?

298
00:36:20,695 --> 00:36:22,902
Sir Joseph was just
wondering how you knew

299
00:36:22,989 --> 00:36:26,074
where the tomb of the princess
Anck-es-en-Amon was hidden.

300
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,327
Partly inference, partly chance.

301
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:33,913
Sir Joseph, you seem disturbed.

302
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:39,295
Yes. A tragedy at the museum
after you left.

303
00:36:40,553 --> 00:36:43,009
Tragedy?

304
00:36:43,097 --> 00:36:45,174
When I was there...

305
00:36:45,976 --> 00:36:48,302
When you were there, Miss Grosvenor?

306
00:36:50,106 --> 00:36:54,152
Yes. They told me I went there
and tried to get in after it was closed.

307
00:36:54,236 --> 00:36:56,478
I don't remember, but...

308
00:36:56,572 --> 00:36:58,649
Helen, it is very late.

309
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:02,073
Frank, will you please
see Helen back to the hotel?

310
00:37:02,162 --> 00:37:06,031
- Certainly, if Miss Grosvenor will let me.
- I don't want to go.

311
00:37:06,668 --> 00:37:09,835
After what happened, you need rest badly.

312
00:37:09,922 --> 00:37:15,843
But I don't. I was tired, but...

313
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:17,969
Why, I've never felt so alive before!

314
00:37:18,057 --> 00:37:21,059
- As your doctor, I must order you to go.
- I'm not a child.

315
00:37:21,144 --> 00:37:23,221
Yes, please come.

316
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:28,433
Then, Ardath Bey, au revoir.

317
00:37:28,528 --> 00:37:30,605
We must see each other again.

318
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:34,192
I shall be honoured.

319
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:58,523
An unusual crime. A guard killed
by a man who left a gift to the museum.

320
00:37:58,607 --> 00:38:00,683
- A gift?
- A scroll.

321
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,611
Part of which was transcribed
when it was first found.

322
00:38:04,698 --> 00:38:06,821
Here is the transcription.

323
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:13,497
I cannot read the writing
of a period so remote.

324
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:16,621
But you read "Anck-es-en-Amon"
on that piece of pottery.

325
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:18,789
That was of the 18th dynasty.

326
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:21,504
These are pre-dynastic ideographs.

327
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:25,010
The scroll from which this
was copied was stolen ten years ago,

328
00:38:25,098 --> 00:38:28,218
together with the mummy
of the high priest Imhotep.

329
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:30,552
Most interesting.

330
00:38:30,646 --> 00:38:33,731
May I see that scroll, Sir Joseph?

331
00:38:34,192 --> 00:38:37,313
We left it at the... museum.

332
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:40,608
- So.
- I have something else to show you.

333
00:38:41,534 --> 00:38:43,611
A photograph.

334
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,827
Why do you show all this to me?

335
00:38:51,046 --> 00:38:54,083
Do you think it conceivable
that the mummy was not stolen,

336
00:38:54,175 --> 00:38:57,260
but given a semblance
of life by the spell of the scroll.

337
00:38:57,346 --> 00:39:00,431
That scroll is my property.
I bought it from a dealer.

338
00:39:00,516 --> 00:39:04,562
It is here in this house.
I presume, in that room.

339
00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:12,359
We had foreseen this.

340
00:39:12,447 --> 00:39:14,571
The scroll is in safe hands.

341
00:39:14,658 --> 00:39:19,535
It will be destroyed the minute
it is known that harm has come to us.

342
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:24,001
You have studied our ancient arts,
and you know that you cannot harm me.

343
00:39:24,087 --> 00:39:27,670
You also know that you must
return that scroll to me or die.

344
00:39:29,218 --> 00:39:32,967
Now tell that weak fool
to get that scroll, wherever it is,

345
00:39:33,056 --> 00:39:36,307
and hand it to his Nubian servant.

346
00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:40,021
- The Nubian!
- The ancient blood.

347
00:39:42,234 --> 00:39:44,441
So you have made him your slave.

348
00:39:46,155 --> 00:39:53,405
If I could get my hands on you,
I'd break your dried flesh to pieces.

349
00:39:56,209 --> 00:39:58,368
But your power is too strong.

350
00:40:14,273 --> 00:40:17,524
This is the evil force
that has been attacking her.

351
00:40:17,611 --> 00:40:20,529
Burn the scroll, man. Burn it!

352
00:40:20,614 --> 00:40:23,865
It was through you
this horror came into existence.

353
00:40:23,952 --> 00:40:27,487
It's true. It's true.

354
00:42:29,856 --> 00:42:34,685
Your father destroyed the scroll,
knowing that it would cost him his life.

355
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:40,156
What's that?

356
00:42:40,244 --> 00:42:46,165
Isis. The Egyptian symbol of life.
I meant it for your father.

357
00:42:46,251 --> 00:42:48,957
What good could
that old charm have done him?

358
00:42:50,966 --> 00:42:53,884
I tell you, the doctors say
it's plainly heart failure.

359
00:42:53,969 --> 00:42:55,962
The Nubian is missing.

360
00:42:56,055 --> 00:42:59,010
He's an old servant. He's frightened.

361
00:42:59,101 --> 00:43:01,177
He'll be back.

362
00:43:02,104 --> 00:43:06,103
Don't try and make me believe that this
Ardath fellow is a mummy come to life.

363
00:43:06,193 --> 00:43:08,767
That idea, and the horror of it,
killed my father.

364
00:43:08,863 --> 00:43:12,529
The museum guard
died of natural causes, too.

365
00:43:12,617 --> 00:43:14,860
Frank, I need your help.

366
00:43:14,953 --> 00:43:18,822
I saw your attraction
to my patient last night, and hers to you.

367
00:43:20,168 --> 00:43:23,704
- Hers to me? Do you really think so?
- And I welcomed it.

368
00:43:23,798 --> 00:43:27,748
But do you think I have a chance?
Cos I think she's the most won...

369
00:43:29,763 --> 00:43:33,548
- Oh, but this is terrible at a time like this...
- Frank, I'm afraid.

370
00:43:33,643 --> 00:43:38,436
- Will you go with me to her now?
- Yes.

371
00:43:38,524 --> 00:43:42,190
Then telephone her first,
not to leave the hotel.

372
00:43:54,919 --> 00:43:56,996
9590.

373
00:43:58,924 --> 00:44:01,001
No. I'm not going out.

374
00:44:02,845 --> 00:44:06,262
Yes. I promise to wait until you get here.

375
00:44:07,768 --> 00:44:11,601
Goodbye. And I'm so dreadfully sorry.

376
00:44:39,098 --> 00:44:41,341
What were you doing, Doctor?

377
00:44:41,435 --> 00:44:44,222
Your father did not burn
the Scroll of Thoth.

378
00:44:44,313 --> 00:44:46,769
That creature has it now.

379
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:49,729
- The ashes in the fireplace!
- They were newspaper.

380
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,860
The scroll is papyrus.

381
00:44:51,947 --> 00:44:54,617
Then it was murder? The Nubian!

382
00:44:57,788 --> 00:44:59,864
Wear this around your neck.

383
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,962
- Why?
- When we fight this creature,

384
00:45:05,047 --> 00:45:08,748
we must ask protection
from the forces of all that it defied.

385
00:45:08,843 --> 00:45:12,842
- I'll give it to Helen. She needs protection.
- No, her life is not in danger.

386
00:45:12,932 --> 00:45:14,759
It is her soul.

387
00:45:14,851 --> 00:45:19,098
Should love for you come to her,
he will try to destroy you.

388
00:45:19,189 --> 00:45:23,936
That amulet, the Egyptians believed,
was a charm against evil sendings,

389
00:45:24,028 --> 00:45:26,318
such as struck down your father.

390
00:46:32,696 --> 00:46:35,104
Your dog is frightened.

391
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:37,488
My servant will see to him.

392
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,576
Sit down, Miss Grosvenor.

393
00:46:51,511 --> 00:46:54,002
Ancient Egypt.

394
00:46:54,097 --> 00:46:56,174
Nothing modern.

395
00:47:05,069 --> 00:47:07,358
What a strange incense.

396
00:47:07,447 --> 00:47:09,524
Is it not familiar to you?

397
00:47:10,784 --> 00:47:13,620
- No.
- Our forefathers used it.

398
00:47:14,497 --> 00:47:17,071
Yours and mine.

399
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:24,466
You will not remember
what I show you now,

400
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:32,307
and yet I shall awaken memories
of love and crime and death.

401
00:48:04,642 --> 00:48:07,050
I knelt by the bed of death.

402
00:48:40,728 --> 00:48:44,063
Thy father's last farewell.

403
00:49:51,815 --> 00:49:55,150
I knew the Scroll of Thoth
could bring thee back to life.

404
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:18,472
I dared the god's anger, and stole it.

405
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:27,013
I stole back to thy tomb
to bring thee back to life.

406
00:50:28,152 --> 00:50:31,153
I murmured the spell that raises the dead.

407
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:37,569
They broke in upon me
and found me doing an unholy thing.

408
00:50:53,516 --> 00:50:56,637
Thy father condemned me
to the nameless death.

409
00:50:56,728 --> 00:50:58,686
The scroll he ordered buried with me,

410
00:50:58,773 --> 00:51:02,225
that no such sacrilege
might disgrace Egypt again.

411
00:53:09,183 --> 00:53:13,762
A nameless grave. The slaves were killed
so that none should know.

412
00:53:14,731 --> 00:53:18,101
The soldiers who killed them
were also slain,

413
00:53:18,194 --> 00:53:20,187
so no friend could creep to the desert

414
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,732
with funeral offerings
for my condemned spirit.

415
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,997
Anck-es-en-Amon.

416
00:53:37,175 --> 00:53:40,628
My love has lasted longer
than the temples of our gods.

417
00:53:41,848 --> 00:53:44,386
No man ever suffered as I did for you.

418
00:53:45,227 --> 00:53:47,719
The rest you may not know.

419
00:53:47,813 --> 00:53:53,153
Not until you are about to pass through
the great night of terror and triumph,

420
00:53:53,237 --> 00:53:57,615
until you are ready to face moments
of horror for an eternity of love,

421
00:53:59,244 --> 00:54:01,997
until I send back
your spirit, that has wandered

422
00:54:02,081 --> 00:54:05,118
through so many forms
and so many ages.

423
00:54:07,379 --> 00:54:11,793
But, before then,
Bast must again send forth death.

424
00:54:12,135 --> 00:54:15,587
Death to that boy for whom
love is creeping into your heart.

425
00:54:15,931 --> 00:54:18,423
Love that would keep you from myself.

426
00:54:19,185 --> 00:54:23,136
Love that might bring
sickness and even death to you.

427
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:28,396
Awake.

428
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:35,613
Have I been asleep?

429
00:54:36,915 --> 00:54:39,288
I had strange dreams.

430
00:54:40,378 --> 00:54:43,997
Dreams of ancient Egypt, I think.
There was someone like you in them.

431
00:54:44,091 --> 00:54:46,547
My pool is sometimes troubled.

432
00:54:46,636 --> 00:54:51,215
One sees strange fantasies in the water.
But they pass like dreams.

433
00:54:52,601 --> 00:54:55,971
My dog! Wolfram! Wolfram!

434
00:54:56,064 --> 00:54:58,140
Where is he?

435
00:55:08,746 --> 00:55:10,823
Helen.

436
00:55:15,963 --> 00:55:18,372
Helen! Where have you been?

437
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,964
We've been so worried.
We've hunted everywhere.

438
00:55:23,055 --> 00:55:25,132
- In the museum again?
- Yes.

439
00:55:25,225 --> 00:55:27,348
Muller's down in the Arab quarter now.

440
00:55:27,436 --> 00:55:30,473
Well, if I must give an explanation,
it was stuffy in here.

441
00:55:30,565 --> 00:55:35,726
I can't be shut up all the time. And I don't
like the feeling I'm always being watched.

442
00:55:35,821 --> 00:55:38,609
- I took the dog with me.
- Where is the dog?

443
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:48,749
He's dead.

444
00:55:49,463 --> 00:55:53,331
- But how?
- I don't know.

445
00:55:53,426 --> 00:55:56,214
- Well, where?
- I don't remember.

446
00:55:57,139 --> 00:55:59,215
But I can see it now.

447
00:55:59,308 --> 00:56:01,551
Standing on poor Wolfram's back.

448
00:56:01,644 --> 00:56:03,768
- A white cat.
- A white cat?

449
00:56:04,815 --> 00:56:07,022
The cat-goddess Bast!

450
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:10,018
Yes, there was a statue of Bast.

451
00:56:10,113 --> 00:56:12,190
The goddess of evil sendings!

452
00:56:13,242 --> 00:56:15,864
Just what happened?
Try to remember, Helen!

453
00:56:15,954 --> 00:56:19,620
I don't want to remember. Besides,
I don't see it's any affair of yours.

454
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:21,748
Oh, but it is.

455
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:24,125
We know that you were with Ardath Bey.

456
00:56:27,635 --> 00:56:31,051
Oh, Helen. Helen, I love you.

457
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:33,975
I'm trying to help you
and protect you. We all are.

458
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:38,058
Don't let me go again. I'll try to
get away, but you mustn't let me.

459
00:56:39,149 --> 00:56:41,819
No matter what I do or what I say.

460
00:56:41,902 --> 00:56:43,979
There's death there for me.

461
00:56:44,071 --> 00:56:47,488
And life for something else
inside me that isn't me.

462
00:56:47,576 --> 00:56:50,780
But it's alive too, and fighting for life.

463
00:56:50,872 --> 00:56:53,030
Save me from it, Frank. Save me.

464
00:56:53,124 --> 00:56:55,580
Oh, everything's going to be all right.

465
00:56:55,669 --> 00:56:59,288
Now that you've asked for help,
I'll never leave you alone.

466
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:03,677
I'll get Mrs Muller down here with you,
and I'll stay here till the doctor comes.

467
00:57:03,762 --> 00:57:05,839
Then, we'll take you to my house.

468
00:57:06,724 --> 00:57:09,975
Oh, Helen. It's been such torture.

469
00:57:10,646 --> 00:57:12,722
I love you so.

470
00:57:14,359 --> 00:57:19,520
I don't like that doctor. Please go in there
and find out what he's saying about me.

471
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:23,780
I will, my dear. He'll know just
what's the matter with you and cure you.

472
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:25,947
Now, don't worry.

473
00:57:31,129 --> 00:57:34,297
Now, Miss Farthing, help me
to get dressed and get out of here.

474
00:57:34,383 --> 00:57:39,342
- Come over you again, Miss Grosvenor?
- I must escape. I'm being held. Help me.

475
00:57:39,431 --> 00:57:42,137
You told me, when
these fits came on I wasn't to listen.

476
00:57:42,226 --> 00:57:45,263
I have a friend. He's rich.
He'll give you money.

477
00:57:45,355 --> 00:57:48,273
Now you just lie down again.
You know you mustn't get up.

478
00:57:48,359 --> 00:57:50,601
If you don't want money,
what do you want most?

479
00:57:50,695 --> 00:57:54,396
He'll give you anything,
if only you'll help me to go to him.

480
00:57:54,491 --> 00:57:57,065
Do you want me to call Dr Muller?

481
00:57:57,161 --> 00:58:00,613
- No. I hate him.
- Mr Whemple, then?

482
00:58:03,002 --> 00:58:04,995
I'll die if I don't get away from him!

483
00:58:05,088 --> 00:58:07,294
- Now, Miss Grosvenor.
- It's killing me!

484
00:58:07,382 --> 00:58:09,671
Now, Helen, you must not do this again.

485
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,299
You're always so exhausted afterwards.

486
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:17,138
She's too weak to be removed
except to a hospital.

487
00:58:17,228 --> 00:58:20,265
I insist on keeping her here
under our direct observation.

488
00:58:20,356 --> 00:58:23,856
But, Doctor, you haven't told us what
to do. She gets weaker every day.

489
00:58:24,278 --> 00:58:27,695
You know that negligée I bought in Paris?
Help me to put it on.

490
00:58:27,782 --> 00:58:31,366
And bring me my toilet things.
I want some colour. I want to look well.

491
00:58:31,453 --> 00:58:33,696
You can't, my dear. They'd never allow it.

492
00:58:33,789 --> 00:58:36,708
- The nurse would be sure...
- I know. We'll get rid of her.

493
00:58:36,793 --> 00:58:40,626
This is a plot, just between us.
I want to look the way I did.

494
00:58:40,715 --> 00:58:42,672
Just a surprise, for Frank.

495
00:58:42,759 --> 00:58:45,760
And I want you to bring him to me.
You understand?

496
00:58:46,722 --> 00:58:49,677
In short, I have failed
to make a diagnosis.

497
00:58:49,767 --> 00:58:52,769
Medical science is helpless
in a case like this.

498
00:58:53,397 --> 00:58:55,473
Frank.

499
00:58:56,442 --> 00:59:00,108
Go to her, and don't be angry with me.
I couldn't resist her.

500
00:59:04,577 --> 00:59:07,864
Helen, you shouldn't have done this.
They shouldn't have let you.

501
00:59:07,956 --> 00:59:10,958
Just this once. Perhaps the last time.

502
00:59:11,044 --> 00:59:15,042
But you're going to get well.
Then I know I can make you love me.

503
00:59:15,132 --> 00:59:17,208
I know I can make you happy.

504
00:59:21,348 --> 00:59:25,014
I do love you, Frank.
And I'm trying to prove it,

505
00:59:25,102 --> 00:59:27,724
because I'd rather die
than live and lose you.

506
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:31,524
But you're going to live.
We're not going to lose each other.

507
00:59:33,154 --> 00:59:35,313
- So, my dear. You...
- Don't scold me.

508
00:59:35,407 --> 00:59:39,275
Just feminine vanity.
I wanted to look my best again.

509
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:41,778
So you know more
than I realised you knew.

510
00:59:41,873 --> 00:59:46,251
- What do you mean?
- These impulses to go to him.

511
00:59:46,337 --> 00:59:49,255
The pull is too strong
to withstand and live.

512
00:59:49,341 --> 00:59:51,417
I am so glad you understand.

513
00:59:52,761 --> 00:59:55,716
Helen knows. She knows
the moment she stops struggling,

514
00:59:55,807 --> 00:59:58,263
he will give her back
her strength to come to him.

515
00:59:58,352 --> 01:00:03,098
But I don't want to lose my own mind
and be someone else. Someone I hate.

516
01:00:03,191 --> 01:00:09,112
My dear, while you were growing worse,
we tried to find him and failed.

517
01:00:09,198 --> 01:00:12,200
The next time the call comes, go to him.

518
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:19,498
Muller, what can we do now?

519
01:00:19,586 --> 01:00:23,086
We can do no more.
Ardath has beaten me.

520
01:00:23,174 --> 01:00:26,092
The next time he draws her to him,
we must follow her.

521
01:00:26,177 --> 01:00:29,179
- And then?
- We will destroy him.

522
01:00:55,004 --> 01:00:58,670
I've given her some bromide.
She's asleep now. I'll go to bed.

523
01:00:58,759 --> 01:01:01,761
- All right. I'll wait till Dr Muller comes.
- Good night.

524
01:01:01,846 --> 01:01:03,923
Good night.

525
01:03:01,994 --> 01:03:04,034
Where are we?

526
01:03:04,121 --> 01:03:08,369
This is my bed, but this is not the temple,
nor my father's palace.

527
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:11,034
Do not look, Anck-es-en-Amon.

528
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:13,206
Do not be afraid.

529
01:03:13,842 --> 01:03:21,009
I was afraid. When you knelt beside my
bed, a veil came over my eyes. Darkness.

530
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:24,470
Your last memory is of me
in the hour of your death

531
01:03:24,563 --> 01:03:29,310
as I knelt by your bed, 3700 years ago.

532
01:03:29,402 --> 01:03:34,196
No man has ever suffered
for woman as you suffered for me.

533
01:03:34,826 --> 01:03:38,242
- Now that the gods have forgiven us...
- No, no, not yet.

534
01:03:39,331 --> 01:03:41,408
Your soul is in a mortal body,

535
01:03:42,669 --> 01:03:46,085
renewed many times
since we loved in Thebes of old.

536
01:03:47,466 --> 01:03:51,963
But that love is not for us again
until the great change.

537
01:03:52,055 --> 01:03:54,132
I do not understand.

538
01:04:00,399 --> 01:04:02,475
Look.

539
01:04:12,705 --> 01:04:16,918
- Look and wonder.
- A figure of myself.

540
01:04:17,253 --> 01:04:20,373
It is my coffin,
made by my father against my death.

541
01:04:22,259 --> 01:04:24,797
What mummy has usurped
my eternal resting place?

542
01:04:24,887 --> 01:04:29,052
It is thy dead shell.
I tried then to raise this body.

543
01:04:29,142 --> 01:04:33,889
I could raise it now, but it would be
a mere thing that moved at my will,

544
01:04:33,982 --> 01:04:36,058
without a soul.

545
01:05:13,447 --> 01:05:16,947
It was not only this body
that I loved, it was thy soul.

546
01:05:17,034 --> 01:05:19,989
I destroy this lifeless thing.

547
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,200
Thou shalt take its place
but for a few moments,

548
01:05:23,292 --> 01:05:27,670
and then rise again,
even as I have risen.

549
01:05:45,987 --> 01:05:48,063
Come.

550
01:06:11,518 --> 01:06:14,970
Imhotep, this is the place of embalming.

551
01:06:16,232 --> 01:06:20,895
It is not lawful for me, a priestess of
Isis, to see or touch an unclean thing.

552
01:06:21,906 --> 01:06:25,240
Come to the altar of Anubis,
the guide of the dead.

553
01:06:36,465 --> 01:06:38,921
The time has come for the final prayer.

554
01:06:39,636 --> 01:06:41,712
What have I to do with Anubis?

555
01:06:46,478 --> 01:06:49,645
The ancient rites
must be performed over thy body.

556
01:06:49,857 --> 01:06:52,064
Then I will read
the great spell with which.

557
01:06:52,151 --> 01:06:55,735
Isis brought Osiris back from the grave.

558
01:06:55,822 --> 01:06:58,112
And thou shalt rise again.

559
01:06:58,617 --> 01:07:00,611
No.

560
01:07:00,703 --> 01:07:03,705
No, I'm alive! I'm young!

561
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:05,949
I won't die!

562
01:07:06,043 --> 01:07:09,211
I loved you once,
but now you belong with the dead.

563
01:07:10,298 --> 01:07:12,588
I am Anck-es-en-Amon, but I...

564
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:16,509
I'm somebody else too.

565
01:07:16,598 --> 01:07:19,303
I want to live,
even in a strange new world.

566
01:07:19,393 --> 01:07:22,513
For thy sake I was buried alive.

567
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:28,396
I ask of thee only a moment of agony.
Only so can we be united.

568
01:07:33,202 --> 01:07:35,278
The bath of natron.

569
01:07:36,122 --> 01:07:39,040
You shall not plunge my body into that.

570
01:07:39,126 --> 01:07:41,249
Let the deed be done.

571
01:07:58,566 --> 01:08:01,188
Let me go. Let me go!

572
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:04,363
Don't kill me! I'm a priestess of Isis.

573
01:08:04,448 --> 01:08:07,118
Save me from that mummy! It's dead!

574
01:08:07,827 --> 01:08:09,904
Save me!

575
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:37,609
I no longer fear you.
Do with me what you will.

576
01:08:54,343 --> 01:08:56,383
Frank.

577
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:58,796
Frank!

578
01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:01,808
She has gone to him.
They must be in the museum.

579
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:05,429
Now I know his horrible plan.

580
01:09:06,441 --> 01:09:10,356
He is going to kill her, and
make her a living mummy like himself.

581
01:09:23,337 --> 01:09:28,130
The gods will receive into the underworld
the spirit of Anck-es-en-Amon.

582
01:09:29,136 --> 01:09:31,212
But not for long.

583
01:09:32,139 --> 01:09:35,723
Osiris will release thy soul.

584
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:54,748
You shall rest from life,
like the setting sun in the west.

585
01:09:54,834 --> 01:09:57,041
But you shall dawn anew in the east,

586
01:09:57,128 --> 01:10:01,376
as the first rays of Amon-Ra
dispel the shadow.

587
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,516
Look! What's that?

588
01:10:18,947 --> 01:10:20,655
Come on.

589
01:10:24,745 --> 01:10:26,822
Anck-es-en-Amon.

590
01:10:30,961 --> 01:10:33,453
Frank! Frank!

591
01:10:42,267 --> 01:10:45,601
Helen! Helen!

592
01:10:47,607 --> 01:10:48,936
Helen.

593
01:10:55,074 --> 01:10:58,325
O Isis, holy maiden.
I was thy consecrated vestal.

594
01:10:58,412 --> 01:11:00,820
I broke my vows. Save me now!

595
01:11:00,915 --> 01:11:04,498
Teach me the ancient summons,
the holy spells I've forgotten.

596
01:11:04,586 --> 01:11:06,663
I call upon thee as of old!

597
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:05,526
Helen!

598
01:12:06,579 --> 01:12:09,201
Call her. He has dragged her
back to ancient Egypt.

599
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:12,660
Call her! Her love for you
may bridge the centuries.

600
01:12:13,754 --> 01:12:16,922
Helen. Helen!

601
01:12:17,008 --> 01:12:19,298
Come back. It's Frank.

602
01:12:20,596 --> 01:12:22,673
Come back.
