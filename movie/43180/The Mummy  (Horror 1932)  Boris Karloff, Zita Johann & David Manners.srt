1
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,568
試著教我一課
耐心地，約瑟夫爵士？*
{\fs12}Trying to teach me a lesson in patience, Sir Joseph?{\r}

2
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,008
在考古學方法代表一切，我的孩子
{\fs12}Method is everything in archeology, my boy.{\r}

3
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,606
我們總是處理我們的問題
按順序查找當天。*
{\fs12}We always deal with our finds of the day in order.{\r}

4
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,650
我覺得今天挖出來的那個箱子...
{\fs12}Well, it seems to me that that box we dug up today,{\r}

5
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,485
與非常奇特
先生，那邊，*
{\fs12}with the very peculiar gentleman, over there,{\r}

6
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,722
是過去的兩個月以來，唯一的發現...
{\fs12}is the only find we've made in the past two months{\r}

7
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,168
這將為這次探險 獲得大英博物館的頒獎
{\fs12}that'll bring this expedition any medals from the British Museum.{\r}

8
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,084
我們來埃及挖掘，不是為了得獎牌
{\fs12}We didn't come to dig in Egypt for medals.{\r}

9
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,887
從中學到了更多
從研究這些陶器碎片獲取學問*
{\fs12}Much more is learned from studying bits of broken pottery{\r}

10
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,406
而非而不是
所有聳人聽聞的發現。*
{\fs12}than from all the sensational finds.{\r}

11
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,927
我們的工作是去增進人類對古代的了解
{\fs12}Our job is to increase the sum of human knowledge of the past,{\r}

12
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,968
不是為了滿足我們自己的好奇心
{\fs12}not to satisfy our own curiosity.{\r}

13
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,965
約瑟夫爵士，你說的很有道理，但畢竟我們是人
{\fs12}That's all very true, Sir Joseph, but after all, we're human.{\r}

14
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,441
有此種發現...你怎麼還能等？
{\fs12}And a find like this... Well, how can you wait?{\r}

15
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,602
這是你第一次來，我到此工作已經10年了
{\fs12}This is your first trip. I've been out here 10 years,{\r}

16
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,728
對那個木乃伊，我比你還要好奇...
{\fs12}and I'm more curious about that mummy than you are,{\r}

17
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,041
甚至那個箱子也是
{\fs12}and even more about that box.{\r}

18
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,645
惠普。是？
{\fs12}Whemple. Yes?{\r}

19
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,203
內臟未被移除
{\fs12}The viscera were not removed.{\r}

20
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,568
沒發現屍體防腐工作者常見的刀痕
{\fs12}The usual scar made by the embalmer's knife is not there.{\r}

21
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,688
我看也是，穆勒
{\fs12}I guessed as much, Muller.{\r}

22
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,691
在拍照的時候，我很仔細看過他了
{\fs12}I had a good look at him when I photographed him.{\r}

23
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,087
從未見過這樣的木乃伊
{\fs12}Never saw a mummy like that.{\r}

24
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,766
我想，應該沒任何人見過
{\fs12}Neither, I imagine, has anyone else.{\r}

25
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,811
看起來似乎他死於某種慘絕人寰的方式
{\fs12}Looks as though he died in some sensationally unpleasant manner.{\r}

26
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,331
扭曲的肌肉顯示他在繃帶裡掙扎
{\fs12}The contorted muscles show that he struggled in the bandages.{\r}

27
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,965
被活埋了
{\fs12}Buried alive.{\r}

28
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,210
“印和闐”
{\fs12}"Imhotep,"{\r}

29
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,249
“卡納克太陽神殿的大祭司“
{\fs12}"High Priest of the Temple of the Sun at Karnak."{\r}

30
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,881
可憐的老傢伙
{\fs12}Poor old fellow.{\r}

31
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,884
到底做了什麼，才會得到這種逞罰？
{\fs12}Now, what could you have done to make them treat you like that?{\r}

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,810
叛國罪被處決，我想
{\fs12}An execution for treason, I suppose.{\r}

33
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,564
比較像是褻瀆，看
{\fs12}Sacrilege, more likely. Look.{\r}

34
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,247
在通往冥界的旅途中，用來保護靈魂的符咒...
{\fs12}The sacred spells which protect the soul in its journey to the underworld{\r}

35
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,448
從棺材裡削掉了
{\fs12}have been chipped off of the coffin.{\r}

36
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,923
所以印和闐不但在人間被判死刑，在陰間也是
{\fs12}So Imhotep was sentenced to death not only in this world, but in the next.{\r}

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,607
也許他跟神殿的女祭司，過得太歡樂了
{\fs12}Maybe he got too gay with the vestal virgins in the temple.{\r}

38
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,966
有可能
{\fs12}Possibly.{\r}

39
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,485
卡納克神殿的女祭司...
{\fs12}The priestesses of the Temple of Karnak{\r}

40
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,449
是統治者法老的女兒們
{\fs12}were the daughters of the reigning pharaohs.{\r}

41
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,091
他們是伊希斯女神的神聖處女
{\fs12}They were the sacred virgins of Isis.{\r}

42
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,084
跟他一起陪葬的箱子裡，也許有答案
{\fs12}Maybe the answer's in that box we found buried with him.{\r}

43
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,562
我知道在打開箱子之前，我不可能得到解答
{\fs12}I see I shall get no more work out of you until after it's open.{\r}

44
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,371
來吧。讓我們去拿箱子
{\fs12}Come on. Let's have the box up there.{\r}

45
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,727
木頭腐朽至此，一碰就粉碎了
{\fs12}The Wood's so rotten, it'll fall apart at a touch.{\r}

46
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,531
不管是什麼，還真重的要命
{\fs12}Whatever it is, it's terribly heavy.{\r}

47
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,522
金屬，看起來像銅
{\fs12}Metal. Looks like copper.{\r}

48
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,731
這是黃金
{\fs12}It's gold.{\r}

49
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,804
我說！看這裡
{\fs12}I say! Look here.{\r}

50
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,930
阿蒙諾菲斯法老 完整的印章
{\fs12}The unbroken seals of the Pharaoh Amenophis.{\r}

51
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,843
一些神殿的寶藏
{\fs12}Some temple treasure.{\r}

52
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,691
“死亡，永恆的懲罰...”
{\fs12}"Death, eternal punishment"{\r}

53
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,483
“不論是誰...”
{\fs12}"for anyone"{\r}

54
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,201
“只要他打開這個棺材...”
{\fs12}"who opens this casket,"{\r}

55
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,247
“奉阿蒙-拉之名--“
{\fs12}"in the name of Amon-Ra,"{\r}

56
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,323
“眾神之王”
{\fs12}"the King of the Gods."{\r}

57
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,364
我的媽呀！好可怕的詛咒！
{\fs12}Good heavens! What a terrible curse!{\r}

58
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,245
讓我們看看裡面有什麼。等等！
{\fs12}Well, let's see what's inside. Wait!{\r}

59
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,288
你已經念了咒文
{\fs12}You have read the curse.{\r}

60
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,680
我們知道你在玄學方面學有專精，穆勒...
{\fs12}We recognize your mastery of the occult sciences, Muller,{\r}

61
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,206
但我不能讓你的信仰來干擾我的工作
{\fs12}but I can't permit your beliefs to interfere with my work.{\r}

62
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,203
那今天下午為什麼叫我來？
{\fs12}Then why did you send for me this afternoon?{\r}

63
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,964
作為朋友和專家
{\fs12}As a friend and an expert.{\r}

64
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,725
因為這項發現很獨特，我想徵求你的意見
{\fs12}Because I saw this find was unique, and I wanted your opinion on it.{\r}

65
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,450
你如此做，頗符合天意
{\fs12}It is providential that you did.{\r}

66
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,251
來吧，穆勒博士。當然有幾個
在地球上千年*
{\fs12}Come, Dr. Muller. Surely a few thousand years in the earth{\r}

67
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,766
會採取mumbo-jumbo
任何舊的詛咒。*
{\fs12}would take the mumbo-jumbo off any old curse.{\r}

68
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,968
我不能在一個男孩面前說
{\fs12}I cannot speak before a boy.{\r}

69
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,926
出去埃及的星空下
{\fs12}Come out under the stars of Egypt.{\r}

70
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,842
不要碰那個棺材
{\fs12}Do not touch that casket.{\r}

71
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,449
繼續做你的編目，我們稍後會打開
{\fs12}Go on with your cataloging. We'll open it later.{\r}

72
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,727
你不用費心說服我，不要去檢查...
{\fs12}You needn't think you can persuade me not to examine{\r}

73
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,361
我在此地全部的經歷裡面 最精彩的發現
{\fs12}the most wonderful find of my whole experience out here.{\r}

74
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,841
關於這個傳說，如果你是對的...
{\fs12}If you're right about the legend,{\r}

75
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,605
那這個棺材可能有智慧之神的捲軸
{\fs12}then this casket may contain the Scroll of Thoth{\r}

76
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,682
那是這個神殿的聖中之聖
{\fs12}from the holy of holies in the temple.{\r}

77
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,410
我迫不及待想回去找出來
{\fs12}And I can hardly wait to get back to find out.{\r}

78
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,605
埃及眾神仍然活躍在這些山區，在他們傾頹的神殿中
{\fs12}The gods of Egypt still live in these hills, in their ruined temples.{\r}

79
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,923
古代符咒雖減弱，但是其中一些仍有法力...
{\fs12}The ancient spells are weaker, but some of them are still potent,{\r}

80
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,447
我相信你的棚屋裡有智慧之神的捲軸...
{\fs12}and I believe that you have in your hut the Scroll of Thoth itself,{\r}

81
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,366
其中包含了偉大的咒語...
伊希斯女神持此咒讓俄西里斯死而復生
{\fs12}which contains the great spell by which Isis raised Osiris from the dead.{\r}

82
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,605
放回去吧。埋回原來的發現之處
{\fs12}Put it back. Bury it where you found it.{\r}

83
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,283
你既已念了咒文，你膽敢違逆嗎？
{\fs12}You have read the curse. You dare defy it?{\r}

84
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,887
為了科學的利益，即使我相信詛咒...
{\fs12}In the interest of science, even if I believed in the curse,{\r}

85
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,247
也要繼續替博物館 完我的工作
{\fs12}I'd go on with my work for the museum.{\r}

86
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,802
跟我一起回去，我們一起來檢查這個偉大的發現
{\fs12}Come back with me, and we'll examine this great find together.{\r}

87
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,327
在我目睹之下，無法容忍此種褻瀆神靈的行為
{\fs12}I cannot condone an act of sacrilege with my presence.{\r}

88
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,961
怎麼了，老兄？這是什麼？
{\fs12}What's the matter, man? For heaven's sake, what is it?{\r}

89
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,442
他...他走了一會兒
{\fs12}He... He went for a little walk.{\r}

90
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,041
你應該看看他的臉
{\fs12}You should have seen his face.{\r}

91
00:12:41,535 --> 00:12:43,055
總算有點刺激的事來了
{\fs12}Here's something to break the monotony.{\r}

92
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,208
有一位訪客從尼羅河走上小路了
{\fs12}There's a visitor coming up the trail from the Nile.{\r}

93
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,611
膚色？國籍？
{\fs12}Color? Nationality?{\r}

94
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,569
那麼刺眼，哪看得清楚？
{\fs12}How could I see in that glare?{\r}

95
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,120
惠普，我們回到倫敦去吧
{\fs12}Well, Whemple, back we go to London.{\r}

96
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,725
我們看起來有多蠢
{\fs12}And what fools we look.{\r}

97
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,885
在該死的沙漠一個洞接一個洞的挖，錢都白花了
{\fs12}Money wasted. Hole after hole dug in this blasted desert.{\r}

98
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,645
幾顆珠子，幾個破鍋子
{\fs12}A few beads, a few broken pots.{\r}

99
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,961
幹這一行，不是辛苦工作就行的
{\fs12}A man needs more than hard work for this game.{\r}

100
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,601
他需要天賦，需要運氣，就像你父親一樣
{\fs12}He needs flair. He needs luck, like your father.{\r}

101
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,405
以前他來這裡的時候，還沒那麼多競爭者
{\fs12}In the days when he used to come out here, there wasn't so much competition.{\r}

102
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,244
只要他一來，就有所斬獲
{\fs12}When he did, he found things.{\r}

103
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,484
曾經，10年前吧，他發現太多東西了
{\fs12}And once, 10 years ago, he found too much.{\r}

104
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,608
是10年前的事嗎？
{\fs12}Was it 10 years ago?{\r}

105
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,684
怪事，他一起鬼混的那個牛津的年輕小夥子
{\fs12}Queer story, that young Oxford chap he had with him going mad.{\r}

106
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,808
-知道我認為它是什麼嗎？   -不，是什麼？
{\fs12}-You know what I think it was?  -No. What?{\r}

107
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,645
我覺得他瘋了，很無聊
超越人類的耐力
{\fs12}I think he went crazy, bored beyond human endurance,{\r}

108
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,643
亂搞
這沙子和這些岩石。
{\fs12}messing around in this sand and these rocks.{\r}

109
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,643
你父親找到了他的時候，他笑個不停
{\fs12}He was laughing when your father found him.{\r}

110
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,371
他笑到死，穿著緊身夾克
{\fs12}He died laughing, in a straitjacket.{\r}

111
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,848
你父親從沒解釋過
{\fs12}Your father never explained.{\r}

112
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,730
但當時英格蘭已研發出最好的挖掘機...
{\fs12}But when the best excavator England has turned out,{\r}

113
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,600
一個熱愛埃及的人，說他永遠不會回這裡...
{\fs12}a man who loved Egypt, said he'd never come back here,{\r}

114
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,569
這一定有某些意義
{\fs12}that meant something.{\r}

115
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,644
進來吧
{\fs12}Come in.{\r}

116
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,443
你弄壞了你的營地，皮爾森教授？
{\fs12}You break your season's camp, Professor Pearson?{\r}

117
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,000
你的同事們回倫敦了？
{\fs12}Your colleagues have returned to London?{\r}

118
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,687
是。惠普和我留了下來清理
{\fs12}Yes. Whemple and I stayed behind to clear up.{\r}

119
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,411
你們的探險尚未成功
{\fs12}Your expedition has not been a success.{\r}

120
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,007
幾乎沒有。這些是本季的發現
{\fs12}Scarcely. Here are the season's finds.{\r}

121
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:22,326
容我向您展示自圖坦卡蒙以來最轟動發現
{\fs12}Permit me to present you with the most sensational find since that of Tutankhamen.{\r}

122
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,006
沒見過你這麼興奮，可以問為什麼嗎？
{\fs12}This is very sporting of you. May I ask why?{\r}

123
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,881
我們埃及人不被允許去挖掘我們祖先的遺骸
{\fs12}We Egyptians are not permitted to dig up our ancient dead.{\r}

124
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,804
只有外國的博物館
{\fs12}Only foreign museums.{\r}

125
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,770
那這是什麼？
{\fs12}Well, what's this?{\r}

126
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,562
安克蘇娜姆公主陪葬品的一部分...，
{\fs12}Part of the funerary equipment of the Princess Anck-es-en-Amon,{\r}

127
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,041
偉大的阿蒙諾菲斯的女兒
{\fs12}daughter of Amenophis the Magnificent.{\r}

128
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,884
是。這是她的名字
{\fs12}Yes. It's her name.{\r}

129
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,806
在距離我們不到100碼的地方發現的
{\fs12}I found that not 100 yards from where we are.{\r}

130
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,725
你是說，你認為她的墳墓在那裡？
{\fs12}You mean, you think her tomb is there?{\r}

131
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,962
我會告訴你在哪裡挖的
{\fs12}I will show you where to dig.{\r}

132
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,889
我覺得你非常好心，你是...
{\fs12}I'm sure it's very good of you, Mr...{\r}

133
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,889
我沒聽清楚你的名字
{\fs12}I didn't catch your name.{\r}

134
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,809
阿德斯.貝
{\fs12}Ardeth Bay.{\r}

135
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,486
只有旁證，證據不足，也許...
{\fs12}Circumstantial evidence. Not very strong, perhaps,{\r}

136
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,530
但如果把Kerna那群挖工調來這裡工作...
{\fs12}but if we put that gang of diggers from Kerna on the job,{\r}

137
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,604
如果這裡有什麼，兩天內就知分曉
{\fs12}we can tell in two days if there's anything here.{\r}

138
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,808
一天內，教授
{\fs12}In one day, Professor.{\r}

139
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,969
小心階梯！
{\fs12}It's a step!{\r}

140
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,246
他說的沒錯
{\fs12}He was right.{\r}

141
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,402
總之，我們發現一些東西
{\fs12}Anyhow, we found something.{\r}

142
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,642
安克蘇娜姆的名字
{\fs12}The name of Anck-es-en-Amon.{\r}

143
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,961
我們發電報給你在倫敦的父親
{\fs12}We will cable your father in London.{\r}

144
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,169
他會趕來跟我們一起研究這個偉大的發現
{\fs12}He must be here when we examine this great find.{\r}

145
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,447
七個豺狼的印章
{\fs12}The seal of the seven jackals.{\r}

146
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,850
而且是完整的
{\fs12}And it's unbroken.{\r}

147
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:03,367
皇家墓地的祭司密封這扇門之後，就沒人進入過
{\fs12}No one has entered this door since the priests of the royal necropolis sealed it.{\r}

148
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,964
三千七百年前
{\fs12}3,700 years ago.{\r}

149
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,367
世界上還有這種景觀嗎，海倫？
{\fs12}Is there a view like this in all the world, Helen?{\r}

150
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,965
真正的埃及
{\fs12}The real Egypt.{\r}

151
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,801
我們真的到了驚人的，現代的開羅？
{\fs12}Are we really in this dreadful, modern Cairo?{\r}

152
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,282
你的心思已遠離舞會，和這些漂亮的英國男孩
{\fs12}Your thoughts are far away from the dance and these nice English boys, my dear.{\r}

153
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,966
才不是，我在享受這段美好的時光
{\fs12}Not really. I'm having a lovely time.{\r}

154
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,088
-我很感激。     -但為什麼？
{\fs12}-I'm so grateful.     -But why?{\r}

155
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,288
當然是因為你把我留下來陪你
{\fs12}For your keeping me here with you, of course.{\r}

156
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,445
所以我就不用到燠熱蠻荒的蘇丹 去找神父
{\fs12}So I don't have to go up to Father in that beastly hot Sudan.{\r}

157
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,967
我得感激我最有趣的病人
{\fs12}It's I who am grateful, my most interesting patient.{\r}

158
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,924
知道那是誰嗎？
{\fs12}Know who that is?{\r}

159
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,484
-維也納的穆勒   -真的？
{\fs12}-Muller of Vienna.    -Really?{\r}

160
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,690
總是來這裡過冬，他是埃及神秘學的權威
{\fs12}Always spends his winters here. Authority on the Egyptian occult.{\r}

161
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,807
是的，但那女孩
{\fs12}Yes, but the girl.{\r}

162
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,006
海倫.格羅夫納
{\fs12}Helen Grosvenor.{\r}

163
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,924
她父親是蘇丹總督，自然是英國人了
{\fs12}Her father's Governor of the Sudan. English, of course.{\r}

164
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,766
她母親是埃及人。有些老家族的族譜有一英里長
{\fs12}Her mother, Egyptian. Some old family with a tree a mile long.{\r}

165
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,888
她跟穆勒博士夫婦住在這裡
{\fs12}She's staying here with Dr. and Mrs. Muller.{\r}

166
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,886
對不起，先生。我們的打烊鈴響了
{\fs12}Pardon me, sir. Our closing bell has rung.{\r}

167
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,088
我沒注意到時間
{\fs12}I did not notice the time.{\r}

168
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,722
我正在跟約瑟夫.惠普爵士談話？
{\fs12}I am addressing Sir Joseph Whemple?{\r}

169
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,881
是
{\fs12}Yes.{\r}

170
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,083
我是阿德斯.貝 Bay
{\fs12}I am Ardeth Bay.{\r}

171
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,491
確實！
{\fs12}Indeed!{\r}

172
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,766
我們能欣賞這個展覽全都要感謝你
{\fs12}Why, we have you to thank that we have this exhibit here at all.{\r}

173
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,049
為了閣下光臨，博物館應該整夜開放
{\fs12}The museum should be kept open all night in your honor.{\r}

174
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,801
你想下來我的辦公室嗎？我工作到很晚
{\fs12}Won't you come down to my office? I'm working here late.{\r}

175
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,770
請你原諒。我不喜歡被碰觸
{\fs12}Your pardon. I dislike to be touched.{\r}

176
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,808
東方人的偏見
{\fs12}An Eastern prejudice.{\r}

177
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,809
你不坐下嗎？
{\fs12}Won't you sit down?{\r}

178
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,970
你認識我的兒子
{\fs12}You know my son.{\r}

179
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,570
阿德斯.貝。打開墓室的時候，你跑去哪兒了？
{\fs12}Ardeth Bay. Where did you disappear to when we opened the tomb?{\r}

180
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,961
我回到了開羅
{\fs12}I returned to Cairo.{\r}

181
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,601
但...但現在我不能叨擾你
{\fs12}But... But now I must not detain you.{\r}

182
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,923
但我必須再見到你。你...必須來我家
{\fs12}But I must see you again. You... You must come to my house.{\r}

183
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,846
很遺憾我太忙了，無法接受邀請
{\fs12}I regret I am too occupied to accept invitations.{\r}

184
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,964
他是個怪人
{\fs12}He's a strange one.{\r}

185
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,489
但至少你要感謝那個人
{\fs12}But you might at least have thanked the man.{\r}

186
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,528
他很盡責去尋找公主
{\fs12}He was responsible for finding the princess.{\r}

187
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,682
是啊。我倒希望他沒這麼盡心
{\fs12}Yes. I rather wish he hadn't been.{\r}

188
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,650
我認為這是個詭計，開羅博物館保留我們所發現的一切
{\fs12}I think it's a dirty trick, this Cairo Museum keeping everything we've found.{\r}

189
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,290
那是合同
{\fs12}That was the contract.{\r}

190
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,648
大英博物館為此工作是基於科學因素，而非戰利品
{\fs12}The British Museum works for the cause of science, not for loot.{\r}

191
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,927
安克蘇娜姆
{\fs12}Anck-es-en-Amon.{\r}

192
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,050
安克蘇娜姆
{\fs12}Anck-es-en-Amon.{\r}

193
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,088
安克蘇娜姆
{\fs12}Anck-es-en-Amon.{\r}

194
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,323
有什麼事嗎？
{\fs12}Is anything the matter?{\r}

195
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,929
安克蘇娜姆
{\fs12}Anck-es-en-Amon.{\r}

196
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,609
安克蘇娜姆
{\fs12}Anck-es-en-Amon.{\r}

197
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,727
小姐，你想去哪裡？
{\fs12}Where do you want to go, miss?{\r}

198
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,848
古物博物館
{\fs12}Le Musee des Antiquites.{\r}

199
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,685
印和闐
{\fs12}Imhotep.{\r}

200
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,928
安克蘇娜姆。安克蘇娜姆
{\fs12}Anck-es-en-Amon. Anck-es-en-Amon.{\r}

201
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,445
印和闐
{\fs12}Imhotep.{\r}

202
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,366
印和闐
{\fs12}Imhotep.{\r}

203
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,885
我必須進去
{\fs12}I must get in.{\r}

204
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,724
安克蘇娜姆
{\fs12}Anck-es-en-Amon.{\r}

205
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,881
我必須
{\fs12}I must.{\r}

206
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,724
夜間是關閉的，每個人都回家了
{\fs12}It's closed for the night. Everybody's gone home.{\r}

207
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,290
我必須進去
{\fs12}I must get in.{\r}

208
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,325
印和闐 印和闐
{\fs12}Imhotep. Imhotep.{\r}

209
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,245
印和闐
{\fs12}Imhotep.{\r}

210
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,686
她在說什麼？
{\fs12}What's she saying?{\r}

211
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,449
那是什麼語言？
{\fs12}What language is that?{\r}

212
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,531
古埃及的語言，在地球上消失2000年了
{\fs12}The language of Ancient Egypt, not heard on this earth for 2,000 years.{\r}

213
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,369
而那個名字，特洛伊戰爭之前就不曾再提及
{\fs12}And the name of a man unspoken since before the siege of Troy.{\r}

214
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,766
你的主人在家嗎？
{\fs12}Is your master at home?{\r}

215
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,171
是的，大人
{\fs12}Yes, efendi.{\r}

216
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,323
告訴他，穆勒博士迫切地想見他
{\fs12}Tell him Dr. Muller wishes to see him, urgently.{\r}

217
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,485
我怎麼到這裡了？
{\fs12}How did I get here?{\r}

218
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,131
我們把你帶來的，父親和我
{\fs12}We brought you here. Father and I.{\r}

219
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,690
你昏過去了
{\fs12}You fainted.{\r}

220
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,762
但你怎麼會猜到她在這兒？
{\fs12}But how did you guess she was here?{\r}

221
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,447
我發現她在旅館 搭計程車去博物館
{\fs12}I discovered that she took a taxi from the hotel to the museum.{\r}

222
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,002
我到了那兒，守門的說她搭你的車離開了
{\fs12}I went there. The watchman said she had left in your car.{\r}

223
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:43,002
帶走她之前，我必須告訴你她剛說的話
{\fs12}Before you take her away, I must talk to you about something she said just now.{\r}

224
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,604
哦，穆勒博士
{\fs12}Oh, Dr. Muller.{\r}

225
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,206
你在這兒啊，親愛的
{\fs12}So, here you are, my dear.{\r}

226
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,326
你應該介紹過自己了
{\fs12}I suppose you introduced yourself.{\r}

227
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,447
沒有？
{\fs12}No?{\r}

228
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,285
海倫.格羅夫納小姐；約瑟夫·惠普爵士，法蘭克·惠普
{\fs12}Miss Helen Grosvenor, my old friend Sir Joseph Whemple, Frank Whemple.{\r}

229
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,569
在這些奇特的情況，這似乎太正式了
{\fs12}This seems so formal under these peculiar circumstances.{\r}

230
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,962
如果你沒事的話，我們回去旅館*
{\fs12}And now, if you're all right again, back we go to the hotel.{\r}

231
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,362
我...我認為她應該休息幾分鐘
{\fs12}I... I think she ought to rest a few minutes.{\r}

232
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,651
法蘭克，你會做的嗎？*
{\fs12}Frank, will you make yourself agreeable?{\r}

233
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,960
那...
{\fs12}Well...{\r}

234
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,290
我在哪裡暈倒的，惠普先生？
{\fs12}Where was I when I fainted, Mr. Whemple?{\r}

235
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,283
哦，在博物館外面
{\fs12}Oh, outside the museum.{\r}

236
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,249
我在那做什麼？
{\fs12}What was I doing there?{\r}

237
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,321
我不可能知道，我會嗎？
{\fs12}Well, I wouldn't know that, would I?{\r}

238
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,927
不，我不認為你知道
{\fs12}No, I don't suppose you would.{\r}

239
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,888
但願我知道，你看，我在等...
{\fs12}I wish I did. You see, I was waiting...{\r}

240
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,121
我們別談這件事
{\fs12}Let's not talk about it.{\r}

241
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,611
喔，對
{\fs12}Oh, right.{\r}

242
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,763
你有埃及人血統，不是嗎？
{\fs12}You're partly Egyptian, aren't you?{\r}

243
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,411
是。你怎麼測猜到的？
{\fs12}Yes. How did you guess that?{\r}

244
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,567
哦，我不知道。你的一些氣質吧
{\fs12}Oh, I don't know. Just something about you.{\r}

245
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,205
如果在那裡遇到你，我會更喜歡埃及，但我沒那運氣
{\fs12}You know, I'd have liked Egypt better if I'd met you there, but no such luck.{\r}

246
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,170
困在沙漠裡兩個月，又熱得要命！
{\fs12}Stuck in the desert for two months, and was it hot!{\r}

247
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,446
那個墳墓！
{\fs12}That tomb!{\r}

248
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,851
什麼墳墓？
{\fs12}What tomb?{\r}

249
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,280
你一定讀過公主的故事
{\fs12}Surely you read about the princess.{\r}

250
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,488
-所以你看過了    -是
{\fs12}-So you did that.    -Yes.{\r}

251
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,370
14的階梯下，那完整的印章令人驚心
{\fs12}The 14 steps down and the unbroken seals were thrilling.{\r}

252
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,002
但當我們去處理她所有的衣物、珠寶和如廁用品...
{\fs12}But when we came to handle all her clothes and her jewels and her toilet things...{\r}

253
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,731
你知道，他們埋葬了他們生前的所有器物
{\fs12}You know, they buried everything with them that they used in life.{\r}

254
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,848
當我們去解開那女孩...
{\fs12}Well, when we came to unwrap the girl herself...{\r}

255
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,922
你怎能這樣做？
{\fs12}How could you do that?{\r}

256
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,048
不得不。科學嘛，你知道的
{\fs12}Had to. Science, you know.{\r}

257
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,804
在我們處理她的東西之後，我覺得好像認識她
{\fs12}Well, after we'd worked among her things, I felt as if I'd known her.{\r}

258
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,007
當我們解開了繃帶，我看到了她的臉...
{\fs12}And when we got the wrappings off, and I saw her face...{\r}

259
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,161
你會認為我好傻，但我好像愛上她了
{\fs12}You'll think me silly, but I sort of fell in love with her.{\r}

260
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,166
你得挖開墳墓去找一個心上人嗎？
{\fs12}Do you have to open graves to find girls to fall in love with?{\r}

261
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,801
嘿！
{\fs12}I say!{\r}

262
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,321
現在我知道了你是怎麼回事
{\fs12}Now I know what it is about you.{\r}

263
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,526
她的頭有一些東西...
{\fs12}There was something about her head...{\r}

264
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,401
我從未提及這個名字...
{\fs12}I had never mentioned the name,{\r}

265
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,008
然而我聽到格羅夫納小姐...
用古埃及語，喃喃說著印和闐的事
{\fs12}yet I heard Miss Grosvenor mutter, in ancient Egyptian, something about Imhotep.{\r}

266
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,320
印和闐？
{\fs12}Imhotep?{\r}

267
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,885
那時阿德斯在博物館幹什麼？
{\fs12}What was this Ardeth doing in the museum?{\r}

268
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,730
看著木乃伊，就在閉館的時後
{\fs12}Looking at the mummy, just at closing time.{\r}

269
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,601
你好
{\fs12}Hello.{\r}

270
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,401
什麼？
{\fs12}What?{\r}

271
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,407
來
{\fs12}Come.{\r}

272
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,927
一名博物館警衛被發現死在公主的房間
{\fs12}A museum guard found dead in the room of the princess.{\r}

273
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,609
他因驚嚇而死
{\fs12}So he died of shock.{\r}

274
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,845
在死去的警衛手中，發現了這個，約瑟夫爵士
{\fs12}We find this in dead guard's hand, Sir Joseph.{\r}

275
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:08,005
可能小偷想偷，但警衛拿走了，小偷就殺了他
{\fs12}Probably thief try to steal it. Guard take it away, thief kill him.{\r}

276
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,244
死因，我一無所獲
{\fs12}The cause of death, I not find nothing.{\r}

277
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,681
看起來像是盜竊未遂，但沒任何東西失竊
{\fs12}Looks like an attempted theft, but nothing stolen here could be disposed of.{\r}

278
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,569
什麼是文件？
{\fs12}What is the document?{\r}

279
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,971
我把它放在這裡，你會安心一些
{\fs12}Let me put this here. You'll be more comfortable.{\r}

280
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,280
謝謝
{\fs12}Thanks.{\r}

281
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,605
你真的想知道我為什麼沒帶你去醫院？
{\fs12}You really want to know why I didn't take you to the hospital?{\r}

282
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,205
因為當我把你抱在懷中...
{\fs12}Because when I held you in my arms...{\r}

283
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,045
你不要那麼癡情好嗎？*
{\fs12}Hadn't you better not commit yourself?{\r}

284
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,045
女孩在月光下癱倒在你腳下，有哪個男人能抗拒？
{\fs12}What girl could fail to make a conquest who collapsed at a man's feet in the moonlight?{\r}

285
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,920
我們彼此認識的時間這麼短，我知道這很荒謬
{\fs12}Oh, I know it seems absurd when we've known each other such a short time,{\r}

286
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,081
但我是認真的
{\fs12}but I'm serious.{\r}

287
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,527
你不覺得這一個晚上我驚嚇已經過多了...
{\fs12}Don't you think I've had enough excitement for one evening,{\r}

288
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,127
還要添加一個陌生人對我示愛？
{\fs12}without the additional thrill of a strange man making love to me?{\r}

289
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,560
但我從來沒有像現在這麼認真過
{\fs12}But I've never been serious about this sort of thing before.{\r}

290
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,045
現在，看看這裡
{\fs12}Now, look here.{\r}

291
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,681
你可以叫我去死，但你不能嘲笑我
{\fs12}You can tell me to go to the devil, but you can't laugh at me.{\r}

292
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,807
詛咒襲擊了她，現在經由她，它將攻擊我兒子
{\fs12}The curse has struck her, and now, through her, it will strike my son.{\r}

293
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,041
安靜
{\fs12}Quiet.{\r}

294
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,930
法蘭克，你去你父親的書房好嗎？
{\fs12}Frank, will you come to your father's study?{\r}

295
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,524
海倫，我會親自送你回家
{\fs12}Helen, I shall take you home presently.{\r}

296
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,362
我馬上就回來
{\fs12}I'll be back in a minute.{\r}

297
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,083
印和闐還活著...
{\fs12}Imhotep was alive{\r}

298
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,164
當那個在博物館的木乃伊是神殿的女祭司
{\fs12}when that mummy in the museum was a vestal virgin in the temple.{\r}

299
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,687
三千七百年前！現在和我們有什麼關係？
{\fs12}Thirty-seven hundred years ago! What's that got to do with us, now?{\r}

300
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,922
你的助手，他瘋狂的死了...
{\fs12}Your assistant, who went insane and died,{\r}

301
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,401
你可能已經做過了，如果你看到他所看到的...*
{\fs12}as you might have done if you'd seen what he saw,{\r}

302
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,404
做了該捲軸一部分的轉譯*
{\fs12}made a transcription of part of that scroll.{\r}

303
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,370
是。仍然在我手上
{\fs12}Yes. I have it still.{\r}

304
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,807
你似乎認為這東西，什麼妖魔鬼怪在裡面
{\fs12}You seem to think this thing has all the devils of Hell in it.{\r}

305
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,167
為什麼不燒了它，一了百了？
{\fs12}Why not burn it and be done with it?{\r}

306
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,208
一個優秀的建議
{\fs12}An excellent suggestion.{\r}

307
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,566
印和闐的木乃伊後來怎樣了？
{\fs12}What became of the mummy of Imhotep?{\r}

308
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,404
被人偷走了
{\fs12}Somebody stole it.{\r}

309
00:32:29,135 --> 00:32:31,535
看這裡，穆勒博士。格羅夫納小姐怎麼了？
{\fs12}Look here, Dr. Muller. What's the matter with Miss Grosvenor?{\r}

310
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,042
你仍然認為木乃伊被偷了，約瑟夫爵士？
{\fs12}You still think that that mummy was stolen, Sir Joseph?{\r}

311
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,646
是的，我...
{\fs12}Yes, I...{\r}

312
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,041
哦，我不知道
{\fs12}Oh, I don't know.{\r}

313
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,847
萬分抱歉，我是阿德斯.貝 
{\fs12}A thousand pardons. I am Ardeth Bay.{\r}

314
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,649
我是海倫.格羅夫納
{\fs12}I'm Helen Grosvenor.{\r}

315
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,128
有人叫我去見約瑟夫爵士
{\fs12}I called to see Sir Joseph.{\r}

316
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,324
他正在書房
{\fs12}He's in the study.{\r}

317
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:20,167
會議嗎？也許我等一會兒
{\fs12}A conference? If I might perhaps wait.{\r}

318
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,566
是。當然
{\fs12}Yes. Of course.{\r}

319
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,169
我們以前見過嗎，格羅夫納小姐？
{\fs12}Have we not met before, Miss Grosvenor?{\r}

320
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,244
不，我不這麼認為
{\fs12}No, I don't think so.{\r}

321
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,727
我不認為和你見面後會忘了你，阿德斯.貝
{\fs12}I don't think one would forget meeting you, Ardeth Bay.{\r}

322
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,004
那是我弄錯了
{\fs12}Then I am mistaken.{\r}

323
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,968
但你有我們的血統
{\fs12}But you are of our blood.{\r}

324
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,281
至於那個，我沒有弄錯
{\fs12}As to that, I am not mistaken.{\r}

325
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,361
是
{\fs12}Yes.{\r}

326
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,685
我母親是埃及人
{\fs12}My mother was Egyptian.{\r}

327
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,526
你必須燒掉智慧之神的捲軸
{\fs12}You must burn the Scroll of Thoth.{\r}

328
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,729
我告訴你，這是博物館的財產，不是我的
{\fs12}I tell you, it's the museum's property, not mine.{\r}

329
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,840
外面跟著格羅夫納小姐的是誰？
{\fs12}Who's out there with Miss Grosvenor?{\r}

330
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,685
阿德斯.貝
{\fs12}Ardeth Bay.{\r}

331
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,042
他為捲軸而來
{\fs12}He's come for the scroll.{\r}

332
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,563
阿德斯.貝，穆勒博士
{\fs12}Ardeth Bay, Dr. Muller.{\r}

333
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,326
我接受你的邀請，但我發現沒有帶著書的單身學生
{\fs12}I accept your invitation, but I find no solitary student with his books.{\r}

334
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,201
我擔心我的訪問不洽當
{\fs12}I fear my visit is inopportune.{\r}

335
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,329
相反的，我們剛談及...
{\fs12}On the contrary, we were just talking about...{\r}

336
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,447
我？
{\fs12}Me?{\r}

337
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,249
你的祖國埃及
{\fs12}Your native Egypt.{\r}

338
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,688
你認識格羅夫納小姐嗎？
{\fs12}You know Miss Grosvenor?{\r}

339
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,607
阿德斯.貝自我介紹了
{\fs12}Ardeth Bay introduced himself.{\r}

340
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,684
你不坐嗎？
{\fs12}Won't you be seated?{\r}

341
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,728
約瑟夫爵士剛在納悶 你怎麼知道...
{\fs12}Sir Joseph was just wondering how you knew{\r}

342
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,883
安克蘇娜姆公主的陵墓被隱藏在何處
{\fs12}where the tomb of the Princess Anck-es-en-Amon was hidden.{\r}

343
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,964
部分推論，部分是機運
{\fs12}Partly inference, partly chance.{\r}

344
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,930
約瑟夫爵士，你似乎很不安
{\fs12}Sir Joseph, you seem disturbed.{\r}

345
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,961
是。你離開博物館後，有一場悲劇
{\fs12}Yes. A tragedy at the museum after you left.{\r}

346
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,606
悲劇？
{\fs12}Tragedy?{\r}

347
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,524
我當時在現場？
{\fs12}When I was there?{\r}

348
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,320
當時你在那裡，格羅夫納小姐？
{\fs12}When you were there, Miss Grosvenor?{\r}

349
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,970
是的。閉館之後我想進去時，他們告訴我的
{\fs12}Yes. They told me I went there and tried to get in after it was closed.{\r}

350
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,008
我不記得了，但...
{\fs12}I don't remember, but...{\r}

351
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,408
海倫，已經很晚了
{\fs12}Helen, it is very late.{\r}

352
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,845
法蘭克，請你帶海倫回旅館好嗎？
{\fs12}Frank, will you please see Helen back to the hotel?{\r}

353
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,082
當然，如果格羅夫納小姐允許
{\fs12}Certainly, if Miss Grosvenor will let me.{\r}

354
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,328
但我不想去
{\fs12}But I don't want to go.{\r}

355
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,165
發生了這些事，你非常需要休息
{\fs12}After what happened, you need rest badly.{\r}

356
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,085
但我不要
{\fs12}But I don't.{\r}

357
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,729
我是累了，但我...
{\fs12}I was tired, but I...{\r}

358
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,808
我不曾感到這麼活躍過
{\fs12}Why, I've never felt so alive before.{\r}

359
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,763
作為你的醫生，我必須命令你去
{\fs12}Then as your doctor, I must order you to go.{\r}

360
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,927
我又不是孩子
{\fs12}I'm not a child.{\r}

361
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,604
是。請，來。
{\fs12}Yes. Please, come.{\r}

362
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,281
那...阿德斯.貝，再見
{\fs12}Then, Ardeth Bay, au revoir.{\r}

363
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,761
但我們一定要再次會面
{\fs12}But we must see each other again.{\r}

364
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,684
我會很榮幸的
{\fs12}I shall be honored.{\r}

365
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,690
不尋常的罪行
{\fs12}An unusual crime.{\r}

366
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,329
一名警衛被一名男子殺死，兇手給博物館留下禮物
{\fs12}A guard killed by a man who left a gift to the museum.{\r}

367
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,481
禮物？
{\fs12}A gift?{\r}

368
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,005
一個捲軸
{\fs12}A scroll.{\r}

369
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,448
當它首次被發現時，有一部分被轉譯了
{\fs12}Part of which was transcribed when it was first found.{\r}

370
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,522
這是譯本
{\fs12}Here is the transcription.{\r}

371
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,442
時間這麼久遠，我看不懂寫什麼
{\fs12}I cannot read the writing of a period so remote.{\r}

372
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,404
但你念出了那片陶器上，安克蘇娜姆的名字
{\fs12}But you read the name of Anck-es-en-Amon on that piece of pottery.{\r}

373
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,568
這是第18王朝
{\fs12}That was of the 18th Dynasty.{\r}

374
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,246
這些是王朝統治前的象形文字
{\fs12}These are Predynastic ideographs.{\r}

375
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,842
這捲軸翻自10年前被盜走的手抄本...*
{\fs12}The scroll from which this was copied was stolen 10 years ago,{\r}

376
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,003
和大祭司印和闐的木乃伊放在一起
{\fs12}together with the mummy of the High Priest Imhotep.{\r}

377
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,730
甚為有趣
{\fs12}Most interesting.{\r}

378
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,801
我可以看看那捲軸，約瑟夫爵士？
{\fs12}May I see that scroll, Sir Joseph?{\r}

379
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,770
我們把它留在博物館了
{\fs12}We left it at the museum.{\r}

380
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,367
這樣啊
{\fs12}So.{\r}

381
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,288
我有別樣東西躍給你看，一張照片
{\fs12}I have something else to show you. A photograph.{\r}

382
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,927
為什麼要向我展示這些？
{\fs12}Why do you show all this to me?{\r}

383
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,044
木乃伊不是被偷走的，你覺得這能想像嗎？
{\fs12}Do you think it conceivable that the mummy was not stolen,{\r}

384
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,010
但恢復了生活的外表***
通過Scroll的拼寫...
{\fs12}but restored to a semblance of life by the spell from the Scroll of...{\r}

385
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,402
那捲軸是我的財產。
我是從經銷商處買的。
{\fs12}That scroll is my property.
I bought it from a dealer.{\r}

386
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,121
它就在這所房子裡。
我假設在那個房間裡。
{\fs12}It is here in this house.
I presume in that room.{\r}

387
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,729
我們已經預見到了這一點。
{\fs12}We had foreseen this.{\r}

388
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,488
捲軸安全，
{\fs12}The scroll is in safe hands,{\r}

389
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,770
它將在一分鐘內被銷毀
眾所周知，傷害已經到來。
{\fs12}and will be destroyed the minute it
is known that harm has come to us.{\r}

390
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,003
你研究過我們的古代藝術，和
你知道你不能傷害我。
{\fs12}You have studied our ancient arts, and
you know that you cannot harm me.{\r}

391
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,801
你也知道你必須
將滾動歸還給我或死去。
{\fs12}You also know that you must
return that scroll to me or die.{\r}

392
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,880
現在告訴那個弱小的傻瓜
滾動，無論在哪裡，
{\fs12}Now tell that weak fool to get
that scroll, wherever it is,{\r}

393
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,009
並把它交給
他的努比亞僕人。
{\fs12}and hand it to
his Nubian servant.{\r}

394
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,041
努比亞人！
{\fs12}The Nubian!{\r}

395
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,088
古老的血統。
{\fs12}The ancient blood.{\r}

396
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,527
所以你創造了他
你的奴隸。
{\fs12}So you have made him
your slave.{\r}

397
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,770
如果我可以抓住你，
{\fs12}If I could get my hands on you,{\r}

398
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,002
我打破你的
肉乾成碎。
{\fs12}I'd break your
dried flesh to pieces.{\r}

399
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,248
但是你的力量太強了。
{\fs12}But your power is too strong.{\r}

400
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,483
這是邪惡的力量
一直在攻擊她。
{\fs12}This is the evil force that
has been attacking her.{\r}

401
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,841
男人，燒了捲軸。
燒掉它吧！
{\fs12}Burn the scroll, man.
Burn it!{\r}

402
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,888
這是通過你
恐怖的存在。
{\fs12}It was through you this
horror came into existence.{\r}

403
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,248
這是真的。
這是真的。
{\fs12}It's true.
It's true.{\r}

404
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,328
知道，你父親摧毀了捲軸
這會讓他失去生命。
{\fs12}Your father destroyed the scroll, knowing
that it would cost him his life.{\r}

405
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,689
那是什麼？
{\fs12}What's that?{\r}

406
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,807
伊希斯，埃及人
生命的象徵。
{\fs12}Isis, the Egyptian
symbol of life.{\r}

407
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,084
我的意思是你的父親
{\fs12}I meant it for your father.{\r}

408
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,164
這可能有多大的好處
魅力已經完成了他？
{\fs12}What good could that old
charm have done him?{\r}

409
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,684
我告訴你，醫生說是的
一例心臟衰竭。
{\fs12}I tell you, the doctors say it's
a plain case of heart failure.{\r}

410
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,643
努比亞人失?了。
{\fs12}The Nubian is missing.{\r}

411
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,686
他是個老僕人。他是
嚇壞了，但他會回來的。
{\fs12}He's an old servant. He was
frightened, but he'll be back.{\r}

412
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,890
不要試圖讓我相信這一點
阿德斯.貝的傢伙是一個木乃伊來生活。
{\fs12}Don't try and make me believe that this
Ardeth fellow is a mummy come to life.{\r}

413
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,486
這就是那個想法和恐怖
它殺了我父親
{\fs12}It was that idea and the horror
of it that killed my father.{\r}

414
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,281
博物館警衛死了
也是自然原因。
{\fs12}The museum guard died
of natural causes, too.{\r}

415
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,607
法蘭克，我需要你的幫助。
{\fs12}Frank, I need your help.{\r}

416
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:18,685
我看到了你對我的病人的吸引力
昨晚，她和你。
{\fs12}I saw your attraction to my patient
last night, and hers to you.{\r}

417
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,809
她對我？你呢
真的這麼認為？
{\fs12}Hers to me? Do you
really think so?{\r}

418
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,609
我歡迎它。
{\fs12}And I welcomed it.{\r}

419
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,250
但你認為嗎？
我有機會嗎？
{\fs12}But do you think
I have a chance?{\r}

420
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,641
因為我想
她是最...
{\fs12}'Cause I think
she's the most...{\r}

421
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,204
但這太可怕了
在這樣的時間。
{\fs12}But this is terrible
at a time like this.{\r}

422
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,205
法蘭克，我很害怕。你會
現在和我一起去找她？
{\fs12}Frank, I'm afraid. Will you
go with me to her now?{\r}

423
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,360
是。
{\fs12}Yes.{\r}

424
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,529
然後先給她打電話
不要離開旅館。
{\fs12}Then telephone her first
not to leave the hotel.{\r}

425
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,484
{\fs12}9-5-9-0.{\r}

426
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,722
不，我不會出去。
{\fs12}No, I'm not going out.{\r}

427
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,087
是的，我保證會等
直到你到這兒
{\fs12}Yes, I promise to wait
until you get here.{\r}

428
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,726
再見。
{\fs12}Goodbye.{\r}

429
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,488
而且我非常抱歉。
{\fs12}And I'm so dreadfully sorry.{\r}

430
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,845
你懂...
{\fs12}You know...{\r}

431
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,081
你在做什麼，博士？
{\fs12}What were you doing, Doctor?{\r}

432
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,609
你父親沒有燒掉Scroll
透特那個生物現在擁有它。
{\fs12}Your father did not burn the Scroll
of Thoth. That creature has it now.{\r}

433
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,760
但是壁爐裡的灰燼。
{\fs12}But the ashes in the fireplace.{\r}

434
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,929
他們是報紙。
捲軸是紙莎草紙。
{\fs12}They were newspaper.
The scroll is papyrus.{\r}

435
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,450
然後是謀殺。
努比亞人。
{\fs12}Then it was murder.
The Nubian.{\r}

436
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,602
戴在脖子上。
{\fs12}Wear this around your neck.{\r}

437
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,007
為什麼？
{\fs12}Why?{\r}

438
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,730
當我們對抗這個生物時，
{\fs12}When we fight this creature,{\r}

439
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,486
我們必須要求保護
它無視的舊勢力。
{\fs12}we must ask protection from the
forces of old that it defied.{\r}

440
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,329
我會把它交給海倫。她
需要保護的人。
{\fs12}I'll give it to Helen. She's
the one that needs protection.{\r}

441
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,882
不，她的生活不是
在危險之中。這是她的靈魂。
{\fs12}No. Her life is not
in danger. It is her soul.{\r}

442
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,884
應該愛你來找她，
他會試圖摧毀你。
{\fs12}Should love for you come to her,
he will try to destroy you.{\r}

443
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,201
那個護身符，
埃及人相信，
{\fs12}That amulet, the
Egyptians believe,{\r}

444
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,723
是邪惡派遣的魅力
比如擊倒了你的父親。
{\fs12}was a charm against evil sendings
such as struck down your father.{\r}

445
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,201
你的狗嚇壞了。
我的僕人會看見他。
{\fs12}Your dog is frightened.
My servant will see to him.{\r}

446
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,202
坐下，格羅夫納小姐。
{\fs12}Sit down, Miss Grosvenor.{\r}

447
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,730
古埃及。
{\fs12}Ancient Egypt.{\r}

448
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,410
什麼都不現代。
{\fs12}Nothing modern.{\r}

449
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,961
多麼奇怪的香。
{\fs12}What a strange incense.{\r}

450
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,088
你不熟悉嗎？
{\fs12}Is it not familiar to you?{\r}

451
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,131
沒有。
我們的祖先使用它。
{\fs12}No.
Our forefathers used it.{\r}

452
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,641
你和我的。
{\fs12}Yours and mine.{\r}

453
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,368
你不會記得的
我現在告訴你的是什麼
{\fs12}You will not remember
what I show you now,{\r}

454
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,968
然而我會醒來
愛的回憶
{\fs12}and yet I shall awaken
memories of love{\r}

455
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,930
和犯罪和死亡
{\fs12}and crime and death.{\r}

456
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,805
<i>我跪在死亡床上。</ i>
{\fs12}I knelt by the bed of death.{\r}

457
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,728
<i>你父親最後的告別。</ i>
{\fs12}Thy father's last farewell.{\r}

458
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,087
<i>我知道Thoth捲軸
可以讓你恢復活力。</ i>
{\fs12}I knew the Scroll of Thoth
could bring thee back to life.{\r}

459
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,084
<i>我敢於眾神的憤怒
偷了它。</ i>
{\fs12}I dared the gods' anger
and stole it.{\r}

460
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:26,765
我偷回了你的墳墓
讓你恢復活力。</ i>
{\fs12}I stole back to thy tomb
to bring thee back to life.{\r}

461
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,127
我咒罵這個咒語
那引起了死人，</ i>
{\fs12}I murmured the spell
that raises the dead,{\r}

462
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,248
<i>但是他們突然襲擊了我</ i>
{\fs12}but they broke in upon me{\r}

463
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,529
<i>發現我在做
一個不聖潔的東西。</ i>
{\fs12}and found me doing
an unholy thing.{\r}

464
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:56,402
<i>你父親譴責我
無名的死亡。</ i>
{\fs12}Thy father condemned me
to the nameless death.{\r}

465
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,289
<i>他訂購的捲軸
和我一起埋葬，</ i>
{\fs12}The scroll he ordered
buried with me,{\r}

466
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,648
<i>沒有這樣的褻瀆
可能會再次羞辱埃及。</ i>
{\fs12}that no such sacrilege
might disgrace Egypt again.{\r}

467
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,524
<i>無名的墳墓。</ i>
{\fs12}A nameless grave.{\r}

468
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:14,241
<i>奴隸被殺了
所以沒有人應該知道。</ i>
{\fs12}The slaves were killed
so that none should know.{\r}

469
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,608
<i>殺死他們的士兵
也被殺了，</ i>
{\fs12}The soldiers who killed them
were also slain,{\r}

470
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,048
<i>所以沒有朋友可以悄悄地走向
沙漠與葬禮</ i>
{\fs12}so no friend could creep to the
desert with funeral offerings{\r}

471
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,122
<i>因為我的譴責精神。</ i>
{\fs12}for my condemned spirit.{\r}

472
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,648
安克蘇娜姆
{\fs12}Anck-es-en-Amon.{\r}

473
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,800
我的愛情持續了很長時間
比我們眾神的寺廟。
{\fs12}My love has lasted longer
than the temples of our gods.{\r}

474
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,928
沒有人受苦
就像我為你做的那樣。
{\fs12}No man ever suffered
as I did for you.{\r}

475
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,526
但其餘的你可能不知道。
{\fs12}But the rest you may not know.{\r}

476
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:52,891
直到你即將通過
恐怖和勝利的偉大夜晚，
{\fs12}Not until you are about to pass through
the great night of terror and triumph,{\r}

477
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,289
直到你準備面對時刻
恐懼永恆的愛情。
{\fs12}until you are ready to face moments
of horror for an eternity of love.{\r}

478
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,883
直到我送回你的精神
{\fs12}Until I send back your spirit{\r}

479
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,045
已經徘徊過
許多形式和許多年齡。
{\fs12}that has wandered through so
many forms and so many ages.{\r}

480
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:11,762
但在那之前，Bast必須
再次發死。
{\fs12}But before then, Bast must
again send forth death.{\r}

481
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:15,640
那個愛的男孩死了
正在爬進你的心裡。
{\fs12}Death to that boy for whom love
is creeping into your heart.{\r}

482
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,326
愛會保持
你是我自己。
{\fs12}Love that would keep
you from myself.{\r}

483
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:23,084
愛可能會帶來疾病
甚至死亡給你。
{\fs12}Love that might bring sickness
and even death to you.{\r}

484
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,206
甦醒。
{\fs12}Awake.{\r}

485
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,004
我睡著了嗎？
{\fs12}Have I been asleep?{\r}

486
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,121
我有奇怪的夢想。
{\fs12}I had strange dreams.{\r}

487
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,282
古代夢想
埃及，我想。
{\fs12}Dreams of Ancient
Egypt, I think.{\r}

488
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,805
有人
跟你在一起吧。
{\fs12}There was someone
like you in them.{\r}

489
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,326
我的游泳池有時會受到困擾。
{\fs12}My pool is sometimes troubled.{\r}

490
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,962
人們看到了奇怪的幻想
水，但他們像夢一樣經過。
{\fs12}One sees strange fantasies in the
water, but they pass like dreams.{\r}

491
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:55,807
我的狗！鎢！
鎢！
{\fs12}My dog! Wolfram!
Wolfram!{\r}

492
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,291
他在哪裡？
{\fs12}Where is he?{\r}

493
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,041
海倫。
{\fs12}Helen.{\r}

494
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,481
海倫，你去過哪裡？
{\fs12}Helen, where have you been?{\r}

495
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,169
我們一直很擔心。
我們到處追捕。
{\fs12}We've been so worried.
We've hunted everywhere.{\r}

496
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,322
又在博物館？
是。
{\fs12}In the museum again?
Yes.{\r}

497
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,528
穆勒下來了
阿拉伯區現在。
{\fs12}Muller's down in
the Arab quarter now.{\r}

498
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,683
好吧，如果我必須給一個
解釋，這裡很悶。
{\fs12}Well, if I must give an
explanation, it was stuffy in here.{\r}

499
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,489
我不能閉嘴
每時每刻。
{\fs12}I can't be shut up
all the time.{\r}

500
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,843
此外，我不喜歡這種感覺
我一直在被關注。
{\fs12}Besides, I don't like the feeling
that I'm always being watched.{\r}

501
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,763
我和我一起帶了狗。
{\fs12}I took the dog with me.{\r}

502
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,729
好吧，狗在哪裡？
{\fs12}Well, where is the dog?{\r}

503
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,521
他...他死了。
{\fs12}He's... He's dead.{\r}

504
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,880
但是怎麼樣？
{\fs12}But how?{\r}

505
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,410
我不知道
{\fs12}I don't know.{\r}

506
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:55,881
哪裡？
{\fs12}Where?{\r}

507
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,844
我不記得了。
{\fs12}I don't remember.{\r}

508
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:03,970
但我現在可以看到它，站在那裡
可憐的沃爾夫勒姆回來了，一隻白色的貓。
{\fs12}But I can see it now, standing on
poor Wolfram's back, a white cat.{\r}

509
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,451
一隻白貓？
{\fs12}A white cat?{\r}

510
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,849
貓女神，巴斯特。
{\fs12}The cat goddess, Bast.{\r}

511
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,201
是的，有
巴斯特的雕像。
{\fs12}Yes, there was
a statue of Bast.{\r}

512
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,487
邪惡女神的送女神！
{\fs12}The goddess of evil sendings!{\r}

513
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,046
發生了什麼事？
試著記住，海倫。
{\fs12}Just what happened?
Try to remember, Helen.{\r}

514
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,043
我不想記得。
{\fs12}I don't want to remember.{\r}

515
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,804
此外，我沒有看到
這是你的任何事情。
{\fs12}Besides, I don't see
that it's any affair of yours.{\r}

516
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,771
哦，但確實如此。我們知道
你在阿德斯.貝 Bay。
{\fs12}Oh, but it is. We know that
you were with Ardeth Bay.{\r}

517
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,608
哦，海倫。
{\fs12}Oh, Helen.{\r}

518
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:34,162
海倫，我愛你。我嘗試著
幫助你並保護你。
{\fs12}Helen, I love you. I'm trying
to help you and protect you.{\r}

519
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,005
我們都是。
別再讓我走了。
{\fs12}We all are.
Don't let me go again.{\r}

520
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:42,160
我會試圖逃脫，但你不能讓
我，無論我做什麼或我說什麼。
{\fs12}I'll try to get away, but you mustn't let
me, no matter what I do or what I say.{\r}

521
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:48,086
那裡有我的死亡和生命
我內心的其他東西不是我。
{\fs12}There's death there for me, and life for
something else inside me that isn't me.{\r}

522
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,009
但它也活著，
並為生命而戰。
{\fs12}But it's alive, too,
and fighting for life.{\r}

523
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,287
法蘭克，救我脫離它。
救救我。
{\fs12}Save me from it, Frank.
Save me.{\r}

524
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,761
哦，一切都好
會沒事的。
{\fs12}Oh, everything's
going to be all right.{\r}

525
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:00,606
既然你已經尋求幫助了
我永遠不會讓你孤單。
{\fs12}Now that you've asked for help,
I'll never leave you alone.{\r}

526
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:04,685
我會讓穆勒太太跟你一起來，
我會呆在這裡，直到醫生來。
{\fs12}I'll get Mrs. Muller down here with you,
and I'll stay here till the doctor comes.{\r}

527
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,366
然後，我們會
帶你去我家。
{\fs12}And then, we'll
take you to my house.{\r}

528
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:11,049
哦，海倫，
這是一種折磨。
{\fs12}Oh, Helen,
it's been such torture.{\r}

529
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:12,887
我是如此愛你。
{\fs12}I love you so.{\r}

530
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,602
我不喜歡那位醫生。
{\fs12}I don't like that doctor.{\r}

531
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,767
請進去看看
他對我的評價。
{\fs12}Please go in there and find out
what he's saying about me.{\r}

532
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,126
親愛的，我會的。
{\fs12}I will, my dear.{\r}

533
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,010
他會知道什麼是
跟你有關係，治愈你。
{\fs12}He'll know just what's the
matter with you, and cure you.{\r}

534
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,684
現在，別擔心。
{\fs12}Now, don't worry.{\r}

535
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,569
現在，斯帕林小姐，幫助我
穿好衣服離開這裡。
{\fs12}Now, Miss Sparling, help me to
get dressed and get out of here.{\r}

536
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,284
它再次來到你身邊，
格羅夫納小姐。
{\fs12}It's come over you again,
Miss Grosvenor.{\r}

537
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,569
我必須逃脫我被關押在這裡。
你必須幫助我。
{\fs12}I must escape. I'm being held here.
You must help me.{\r}

538
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,405
但是你告訴我這些適合的時候
來了，我不是聽。
{\fs12}But you told me when these fits
came on, I wasn't to listen.{\r}

539
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,649
我有個朋友。他很有錢。
他會給你錢。
{\fs12}I have a friend. He's rich.
He'll give you money.{\r}

540
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,530
現在你又躺下了。
你知道你不能起床。
{\fs12}Now you just lie down again.
You know you mustn't get up.{\r}

541
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,967
好吧，如果你不想要錢，
你最想要的是什麼？
{\fs12}Well, if you don't want money,
what do you want most?{\r}

542
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:55,681
他會給你任何東西，如果只是
你會幫我去找他的。
{\fs12}He'll give you anything, if only
you'll help me to go to him.{\r}

543
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,047
你想讓我
打電話給穆勒博士？
{\fs12}You want me to
call Dr. Muller?{\r}

544
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,568
不，我討厭他。
{\fs12}No. I hate him.{\r}

545
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,610
先生，惠普先生？
{\fs12}Mr. Whemple, then?{\r}

546
00:58:04,135 --> 00:58:06,535
如果我不離開他，我會死的。
現在，格羅夫納小姐...
{\fs12}I'll die if I don't get away from him.
Now, Miss Grosvenor...{\r}

547
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,403
這太痛苦了。你聽到了嗎？
拜託，拜託！
{\fs12}It's killing me. Do you hear?
Please, please!{\r}

548
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,926
海倫，你必須
不要再這樣做了。
{\fs12}Now, Helen, you must
not do this again.{\r}

549
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,606
你永遠都是這樣
事後筋疲力盡。
{\fs12}You're always so
exhausted afterwards.{\r}

550
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,446
她太弱了無法移除，
除了去醫院。
{\fs12}She's too weak to be removed,
except to a hospital.{\r}

551
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:21,490
我堅持讓她留在這裡
根據我們的直接觀察。
{\fs12}I insist on keeping her here
under our direct observation.{\r}

552
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,682
但LeBarron博士，你沒有
告訴我們該為她做些什麼。
{\fs12}But Dr. LeBarron, you haven't
told us what to do for her.{\r}

553
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,330
她每天都變弱了。
{\fs12}She's getting weaker every day.{\r}

554
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,482
你知道那個便服
我在巴黎買？
{\fs12}You know that negligee
I bought in Paris?{\r}

555
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:30,166
幫幫我穿上，
把我的廁所帶給我。
{\fs12}Help me to put it on,
and bring me my toilet things.{\r}

556
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,527
我想要一些顏色。
我想好看。
{\fs12}I want some color.
I want to look well.{\r}

557
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,600
但親愛的，你不能這樣做。他們會
從不允許它。護士會...
{\fs12}But you can't do that, my dear. They'd
never allow it. The nurse would be...{\r}

558
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,927
我知道。
我們會擺脫她
{\fs12}I know.
We'll get rid of her.{\r}

559
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,287
這是一個情節，
就在我們之間
{\fs12}This is a plot,
just between us.{\r}

560
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:43,887
我想看看我做的方式。
對法蘭克來說，這真是一個驚喜
{\fs12}I want to look the way I did.
Just a surprise, for Frank.{\r}

561
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:47,203
我希望你把他帶到我身邊。
你明白？
{\fs12}And I want you to bring him to me.
You understand?{\r}

562
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,930
總之，我失敗了
做出診斷。
{\fs12}In short, I have failed
to make a diagnosis.{\r}

563
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,129
醫學無助
在這種情況下。
{\fs12}Medical science is helpless
in a case like this.{\r}

564
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,806
法蘭克
{\fs12}Frank.{\r}

565
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,201
去找她，然後
不要生我的氣。
{\fs12}Go to her, and
don't be angry with me.{\r}

566
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,169
我無法抗拒她。
{\fs12}I couldn't resist her.{\r}

567
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,723
哦，但海倫，你
不應該這樣做。
{\fs12}Oh, but Helen, you
shouldn't have done this.{\r}

568
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,086
他們不應該讓你。
{\fs12}They shouldn't have let you.{\r}

569
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,209
就這一次。
也許是最後一次。
{\fs12}Just this once.
Perhaps the last time.{\r}

570
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,123
但是你會好起來的。
{\fs12}But you're going to get well.{\r}

571
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,248
然後我知道我可以
讓你愛我
{\fs12}Then I know I can
make you love me.{\r}

572
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,482
我知道我可以讓你快樂。
{\fs12}I know I can make you happy.{\r}

573
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,280
法蘭克，我愛你。
而我正在努力證明這一點，
{\fs12}I do love you, Frank.
And I'm trying to prove it,{\r}

574
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,409
因為我寧願死
生活，失去你。
{\fs12}because I'd rather die
than live and lose you.{\r}

575
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:33,201
但是你要活著。我們
不會相互失去。
{\fs12}But you're going to live. We're
not going to lose each other.{\r}

576
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,482
所以，親愛的...
別罵我。
{\fs12}So, my dear...
Don't scold me.{\r}

577
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:40,485
只是女人味的虛榮心。一世
我想再次看起來最好。
{\fs12}Just feminine vanity. I
wanted to look my best again.{\r}

578
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,961
所以你知道的不僅僅是
我意識到你知道。
{\fs12}So you know more than
I realized you knew.{\r}

579
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,041
你什麼意思？
{\fs12}What do you mean?{\r}

580
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,442
這些衝動要發給他。
{\fs12}These impulses to go to him.{\r}

581
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:50,530
拉力過大
承受和生活。
{\fs12}The pull is too strong
to withstand and live.{\r}

582
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,682
我很高興你理解。
{\fs12}I'm so glad you understand.{\r}

583
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,081
海倫知道。
{\fs12}Helen knows.{\r}

584
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,003
她知道這一刻
她停止掙扎，
{\fs12}She knows the moment
she stops struggling,{\r}

585
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,401
他會把她還給她
她有力量來找他。
{\fs12}he will give her back
her strength to come to him.{\r}

586
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,608
但我不想
失去了自己的想法
{\fs12}But I don't want to
lose my own mind{\r}

587
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,445
並成為別人，
我討厭的人。
{\fs12}and be someone else,
someone I hate.{\r}

588
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:07,410
我親愛的，而你
變得越來越糟
{\fs12}My dear, while you
were growing worse,{\r}

589
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,324
我們試圖找到他
並失敗了。
{\fs12}we tried to find him
and failed.{\r}

590
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,370
下次打電話
來吧，去找他。
{\fs12}The next time the call
comes, go to him.{\r}

591
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,766
穆勒，我們現在能做什麼？
{\fs12}Muller, what can we do now?{\r}

592
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:24,367
我們不能再做了。
阿德斯.貝打敗了我。
{\fs12}We can do no more.
Ardeth has beaten me.{\r}

593
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,284
下次他吸引她
對他來說，我們必須跟著她。
{\fs12}The next time he draws her
to him, we must follow her.{\r}

594
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:28,691
然後？
{\fs12}And then?{\r}

595
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,531
我們會毀了他。
{\fs12}We will destroy him.{\r}

596
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:59,886
我給了她一些溴化物。她
現在睡著了。我會去睡覺
{\fs12}I've given her some bromide. She's
asleep now. I'll go to bed.{\r}

597
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,042
行。我會在這裡等到博士
穆勒來了。
{\fs12}All right. I'll wait here till Dr.
Muller comes.{\r}

598
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,088
晚安。
晚安。
{\fs12}Good night.
Good night.{\r}

599
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,611
我們在哪？
{\fs12}Where are we?{\r}

600
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:09,530
這是我的床，但這不是
寺廟也不是我父親的宮殿。
{\fs12}This is my bed, but this is not the
temple nor my father's palace.{\r}

601
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,807
不要看，安克蘇娜姆
{\fs12}Do not look,
Anck-es-en-Amon.{\r}

602
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,044
不要害怕。
{\fs12}Do not be afraid.{\r}

603
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,530
我很害怕。

{\fs12}I was afraid.{\r}

604
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:22,243
當你跪在我的床邊時，
面紗從我的眼睛里傳來。黑暗
{\fs12}When you were kneeling beside my bed,
a veil came over my eyes. Darkness.{\r}

605
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:25,648
你最後的記憶是我的
在你死亡的那一刻
{\fs12}Your last memory is of me
in the hour of your death{\r}

606
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:30,806
當我跪在你的床邊時，
3，700年前。
{\fs12}as I knelt by your bed,
3,700 years ago.{\r}

607
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:35,408
從來沒有人遭受過任何苦難
女人，因為你為我受苦。
{\fs12}No man has ever suffered for
woman as you suffered for me.{\r}

608
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,681
而現在，眾神
原諒我們...
{\fs12}And now that the gods
have forgiven us...{\r}

609
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,370
不，不，還沒有。
{\fs12}No, no, not yet.{\r}

610
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,921
你的靈魂是一個凡人的身體，
{\fs12}Your soul is in a mortal body,{\r}

611
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,482
自那以後多次更新
我們喜歡在舊的底比斯。
{\fs12}renewed many times since
we loved in Thebes of old.{\r}

612
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:52,321
但那種愛不適合我們
再一次，直到偉大的變化。
{\fs12}But that love is not for us
again until the great change.{\r}

613
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,249
我不明白。
{\fs12}I do not understand.{\r}

614
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:02,766
看。
{\fs12}Look.{\r}

615
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,884
看，想知道。
{\fs12}Look and wonder.{\r}

616
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,444
我自己的身影。
{\fs12}Figure of myself.{\r}

617
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:21,808
這是我的棺材，由我的棺材製成
父親反對我的死。
{\fs12}It is my coffin, made by my
father against my death.{\r}

618
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,171
什麼木乃伊篡奪了我的
永恆的安息之所？
{\fs12}What mummy has usurped my
eternal resting place?{\r}

619
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,208
這是你的死殼。
{\fs12}It is thy dead shell.{\r}

620
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:31,762
我試著提出這個
身體。我現在可以提高它。
{\fs12}I tried then to raise this
body. I could raise it now.{\r}

621
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,450
但這只是一件事
在沒有靈魂的情況下，我的意志感動了。
{\fs12}But it would be a mere thing that
moved at my will, without a soul.{\r}

622
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:18,242
這不僅僅是這個身體
我喜歡的。這是你的靈魂。
{\fs12}It was not only this body
that I loved. It was thy soul.{\r}

623
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,607
我毀掉了這個沒有生氣的東西。
{\fs12}I destroy this lifeless thing.{\r}

624
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:24,483
你取代它的位置
但是片刻之後
{\fs12}Thou shalt take its place
but for a few moments,{\r}

625
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:29,122
再起來，
即使我已經復活了。
{\fs12}and then rise again,
even as I have risen.{\r}

626
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,361
來。
{\fs12}Come.{\r}

627
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:16,606
印和闐，這是
屍體的地方。
{\fs12}Imhotep, this is the
place of embalmment.{\r}

628
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:22,247
這對我來說是不合法的，是女祭司
伊希斯，看到或觸摸一個不潔的東西。
{\fs12}It is not lawful for me, a priestess of
Isis, to see or touch an unclean thing.{\r}

629
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:26,687
來到阿努比斯的祭壇，
死者的嚮導。
{\fs12}Come to the altar of Anubis,
the guide of the dead.{\r}

630
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,850
時機已到
為了最後的祈禱。
{\fs12}The time has come
for the final prayers.{\r}

631
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:43,127
我和阿努比斯有什麼關係？
{\fs12}What have I to do with Anubis?{\r}

632
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:51,082
古老的儀式一定是
在你的身體上表演。
{\fs12}The ancient rites must be
performed over thy body.{\r}

633
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,844
然後我會讀
偉大的咒語
{\fs12}Then I will read
the great spell{\r}

634
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:56,322
伊希斯帶來的
奧西里斯從墳墓回來。
{\fs12}with which Isis brought
Osiris back from the grave.{\r}

635
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,680
你又要復活了。
{\fs12}And thou shalt rise again.{\r}

636
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,046
沒有。
{\fs12}No.{\r}

637
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:06,084
不，我還活著！
我年輕！我不會死的！
{\fs12}No, I'm alive!
I'm young! I won't die!{\r}

638
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,727
我曾經愛過你，但現在
你屬於死人。
{\fs12}I loved you once, but now
you belong with the dead.{\r}

639
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,369
我是安克蘇娜姆，
{\fs12}I am Anck-es-en-Amon,{\r}

640
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:17,043
但是我...我也是其他人。
{\fs12}but I... I'm somebody else, too.{\r}

641
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,565
我想生活，即使在
這個奇怪的新世界。
{\fs12}I want to live, even in
this strange new world.{\r}

642
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:23,809
為了你的緣故
我活埋了。
{\fs12}For thy sake
I was buried alive.{\r}

643
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:27,043
我只問你
痛苦的一刻。
{\fs12}I ask of thee only
a moment of agony.{\r}

644
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,566
只有這樣我們才能團結起來。
{\fs12}Only so can we be united.{\r}

645
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,124
natron浴。
{\fs12}The bath of natron.{\r}

646
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,410
你不應該暴跌
我的身體進入那個！
{\fs12}You shall not plunge
my body into that!{\r}

647
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,323
讓契約完成。
{\fs12}Let the deed be done.{\r}

648
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:02,405
讓我走！
讓我走！
{\fs12}Let me go!
Let me go!{\r}

649
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,643
別殺了我！我是一個
伊希斯的女祭司！
{\fs12}Don't kill me! I'm a
priestess of Isis!{\r}

650
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:10,123
救我脫離那個木乃伊！
它死了！救救我！
{\fs12}Save me from that mummy!
It's dead! Save me!{\r}

651
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:38,766
我不再害怕你了。
和我一起做你想做的事
{\fs12}I no longer fear you.
Do with me what you will.{\r}

652
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:56,881
法蘭克！
{\fs12}Frank!{\r}

653
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:58,841
法蘭克！
{\fs12}Frank!{\r}

654
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,243
她去了他。
他們必須在博物館。
{\fs12}She's gone to him.
They must be in the museum.{\r}

655
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,727
現在我知道他可怕的計劃。
{\fs12}Now I know his horrible plan.{\r}

656
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,565
他會殺了她並製造
她像個自己一樣活著的木乃伊。
{\fs12}He's going to kill her and make
her a living mummy, like himself.{\r}

657
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:29,208
眾神將進入黑社會
安克蘇娜姆的精神。{\fs12}The gods will receive into the underworld
the spirit of Anck-es-en-Amon.{\r}

658
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,084
但不長久。
{\fs12}But not for long.{\r}

659
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:36,921
奧西里斯會釋放你的靈魂。
{\fs12}Osiris will release thy soul.{\r}

660
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,807
你將從生活中休息，
{\fs12}You shall rest from life,{\r}

661
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,281
喜歡夕陽
在西方。
{\fs12}like the setting sun
in the West.{\r}

662
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,202
但是你會重新開始
在東方
{\fs12}But you shall dawn anew
in the East{\r}

663
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:01,966
作為第一縷曙光
Amon-Ra驅散陰影。
{\fs12}as the first rays of
Amon-Ra dispel the shadows.{\r}

664
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,842
看！那是什麼？
{\fs12}Look! What's that?{\r}

665
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:21,446
來吧！
{\fs12}Come on!{\r}

666
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,650
法蘭克！法蘭克！
{\fs12}Frank! Frank!{\r}

667
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,890
海倫！
{\fs12}Helen!{\r}

668
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,001
海倫！
{\fs12}Helen!{\r}

669
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,001
海倫！
{\fs12}Helen!{\r}

670
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,924
哦，伊希斯！神聖的少女！
{\fs12}Oh, Isis! Holy Maiden!{\r}

671
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,050
我是你奉獻的外衣。
我打破了我的誓言。救救我吧！
{\fs12}I was thy consecrated vestal.
I broke my vows. Save me now!{\r}

672
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:05,602
教我古老的召喚，
我忘記的神聖咒語。
{\fs12}Teach me the ancient summons,
the holy spells I've forgotten.{\r}

673
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,762
我一如既往地叫你！
{\fs12}I call upon thee as of old!{\r}

674
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:05,846
海倫。
{\fs12}Helen.{\r}

675
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,570
叫她。他拖了
她回到古埃及。
{\fs12}Call her. He has dragged
her back to Ancient Egypt.{\r}

676
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:14,241
叫她！她的愛
你可能會跨越幾個世紀。
{\fs12}Call her! Her love for
you may bridge the centuries.{\r}

677
