I may have gotten some hard candy for the trip home.

156
00:23:27,968 --> 00:23:28,869
那就夠了
That is enough, then.

157
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,310
你吃了糖 那就是你的晚飯了
You ate the candy, that was your supper.

158
00:23:31,338 --> 00:23:35,208
而不是我獨自一人 辛辛苦苦準備的餐食
The food I worked hard to prepare alone is not.

159
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,447
但媽媽 我趕了好遠的路 我很餓
But, Mama, I rode all that way. I'm starving.

160
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:41,848
你可以等明早再吃剩下的
You may have what's left of it in the morning.

161
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:48,430
- 你要去哪裡  - 睡覺
-Where are you going? -To bed!

162
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,958
我還沒允許你下桌
I did not excuse you from the table.

163
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:54,489
坐下

164
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:05,250
這個家沒有多少錢能糊口了

165
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:08,050
時代不同了 珠兒

166
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,760
你不能再粗心大意

167
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:17,718
想要活命 完全只取決於你我兩個人

168
00:24:18,968 --> 00:24:21,848
你也看到人們對待德國農民的樣子了

169
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:29,438
我們唯一沒有染病或挨餓的原因就是小心謹慎地過活

170
00:24:29,828 --> 00:24:31,098
我知道
I know that.

171
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,968
我有很小心
And I am careful.

172
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:40,500
我不允許你再沈迷愚蠢的幻想 並且逃避責任了

173
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,000
這是懦弱的表現

174
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,290
你父親和我沒把你養得這麼懦弱

175
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,708
清楚了嗎?

176
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,088
很好
Good.

177
00:24:53,088 --> 00:24:55,389
你可以下桌了

178
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,880
主啊 求求你
Please, Lord,

179
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:17,348
讓我成為全世界最著名的明星
make me the biggest star the world has ever known

180
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,218
讓我能離這個地方遠遠的
so that I may get far, far away from this place.

181
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,290
阿門
Amen.

182
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,229
下午好 珠兒
Afternoon, Pearl!

183
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,198
米斯蒂 我喜歡你的裙子
Hi, Mitsy! I like your dress.

184
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,000
噢 謝謝你
Oh, thank you.

185
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,968
終於能打扮漂亮的感覺
It feels wonderful to finally be able to

186
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,938
真的是太好了
don something pretty again.

187
00:26:48,968 --> 00:26:50,968
這是幾周以來我們第一次離開家
It's the first time we've left home in weeks.

188
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,208
媽媽特別害怕染上病
Mother is so afraid of getting ill.

189
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:54,510
我媽媽也是
Mama, too.

190
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,979
我們還有一點擔心
Well, we were a bit worried

191
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:58,208
你們兩個單獨住得這麼遠
about the both of you being out here all alone,

192
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,218
我們帶了點吃的來
so we brought some food.

193
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,680
真是太好心了
That's very kind.

194
00:27:01,718 --> 00:27:03,250
你最近還好嗎?
How have you been getting on?

195
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,188
有霍華德的消息嗎?
Any new letters from Howard?

196
00:27:06,218 --> 00:27:07,688
這個嘛...
Oh, well...

197
00:27:07,718 --> 00:27:10,458
媽媽一直非常擔心
Mother has been riddled with worry.

198
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:13,260
但人們說 沒有消息就是好消息
They say no news is good news, though.

199
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,000
要是他沒有因為尊嚴
If only his pride hadn't gotten him

200
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,129
去參與這場可怕的戰爭就好了
involved in this dreadful war.

201
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,270
要知道我們認識個醫生
You know we had a doctor

202
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,270
可以判定他不符合入伍資格的
willing to declare him ineligible?

203
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,409
換誰都會抓住機會躲過去的
Anyone would've taken that opportunity.

204
00:27:22,438 --> 00:27:23,310
霍華德可不是
Not Howard.

205
00:27:23,338 --> 00:27:26,109
他先是跑出去當了農民
First, he runs off to become a farmer.

206
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,410
現在又參軍
Now, the army.

207
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:31,479
真是為了惹父親生氣什麼都肯做
The lengths my brother will go to just to spite his father.

208
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,318
這樣一直遠離人煙
All this isolation has been enough

209
00:27:33,348 --> 00:27:35,078
足夠讓人發瘋了 是吧?
to make one mad, hasn't it?

210
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,550
確實是
It really has.

211
00:27:37,588 --> 00:27:39,989
我們不接受施捨
No, we don't accept charity.

212
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,458
天啊 露絲 只是頭豬而已
Oh, for God's sake, Ruth. It's just a pig.

213
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,468
珠兒 我能跟你講個小秘密嗎?
Can I share a secret with you, Pearl?

214
00:27:52,598 --> 00:27:54,270
媽媽可能會掐死我
Mother would throttle me

215
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,540
如果她知道了我打算幹什麼
if she knew I was planning on attending.

216
00:27:56,568 --> 00:27:59,680
這週六在教堂有一場選拔
But there's a dance audition this Saturday at our church

217
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:01,510
是一個聖誕舞團
for a Christmas chorus line

218
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,448
給全國的老百姓
to bring merriment to folks

219
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:04,680
帶來節日的快樂
throughout the state during the holidays.

220
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:07,619
有消息說哦 他們組織的這個舞團
Word is, they're putting together a troupe

221
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,790
將在七個不同的城市巡演
and will be touring seven different cities

222
00:28:09,818 --> 00:28:11,149
就在年底之前
before the year ends.

223
00:28:11,188 --> 00:28:13,060
聽起來是不是很棒?
Don't that sound exciting?

224
00:28:13,088 --> 00:28:15,359
我真希望能成為其中的一員
I would love so much to be a part of it.

225
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,630
我也是
So would I.

226
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,630
那我們應該一起去
We should go together then.

227
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,430
但你不許告訴任何人
But you can't tell a soul.

228
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:22,729
我絕對不說
I would never.

229
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:25,198
太棒了 這是我們的小秘密
Splendid. It'll be our secret.

230
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:26,640
米斯蒂
Mitsy!

231
00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:28,438
我該走啦
I better skedaddle.

232
00:28:28,468 --> 00:28:31,640
這個下午還有三頭豬要送出去
We got three more pigs to drop off this afternoon.

233
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,208
週六 十一點鐘
Saturday at 11:00.

234
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,650
好的
Okay.

235
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,650
親家姐妹就得抱團 對吧?
Sister-in-laws have to stick together, right?

236
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,680
米斯蒂!
Mitsy!

237
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:43,218
- 該走了  - 回見 珠兒
-Time to go! -See you later, Pearl.

238
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,458
拜拜 米斯蒂
Bye, Mitsy!

239
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,197
查莉 也許就是這次了
Charlie, this could be it.

240
00:30:08,838 --> 00:30:10,208
珠兒?
Pearl?

241
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,280
珠兒!
Pearl!

242
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:27,400
《埃及艷後》《百麗宮富麗秀》

243
00:32:00,979 --> 00:32:02,318
哇哦
Well,

244
00:32:02,348 --> 00:32:04,489
沒想到這麼快就又來了
I didn't expect to see you again this soon.

245
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:25,540
坐吧
Have a seat.

246
00:32:36,348 --> 00:32:37,619
我簡直不相信你能
I can't believe you get to see

247
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,718
每天都免費看電影
the pictures every day for free.

248
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,489
確實 這活計不錯
Yeah, not a bad gig, huh?

249
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,560
謝謝你
Thank you.

250
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,000
那麼 是有何事光臨寒捨?
So, to what do I owe this pleasure?

251
00:32:54,068 --> 00:32:55,568
我想了很多
I've been thinking a lot about

252
00:32:55,609 --> 00:32:57,010
你那天說的話
what you said to me the other day

253
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,040
讓我別忘了過自己的人生
about not forgetting to live my life,

254
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:01,310
然後
and, well,

255
00:33:01,338 --> 00:33:04,078
教堂將要舉辦一場舞蹈選拔
there's a dance audition coming up at the church.

256
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:05,718
聽起來不錯
Oh, I like the sound of that.

257
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,750
我也這麼覺得
So do I...

258
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:11,619
但我從來沒有在別人面前跳過舞
But I've never really danced in front of anyone before.

259
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,530
如果我做不到完美怎麼辦?
What if I'm not perfect?

260
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,659
只要夠渴望 你能做到任何事
You can do anything if you want it bad enough.

261
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,500
我很渴望
I want it.

262
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,598
那就別讓任何事阻礙你
Then don't let anything stand in your way.

263
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:27,500
你想看什麼?
What would you like to see?

264
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:29,540
百麗宮富麗秀
Palace Follies.

265
00:33:29,568 --> 00:33:32,409
別這樣 你都看過那部了
Oh, come on. You saw that already.

266
00:33:32,438 --> 00:33:33,708
不如今晚看點不一樣的?
How about something different tonight?

267
00:33:33,739 --> 00:33:34,979
不如...
How about...

268
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,750
看一部誰都沒看過的電影?
How about a film nobody else has seen?

269
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,050
好啊
Okay.

270
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,818
這一部膠片是
I picked this one up while

271
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:47,588
我在法國服役時遇到的
I was in the service in France.

272
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,828
你住在這裡嗎?
Do you live in here?

273
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:00,800
我偶爾會在這床上睡一覺
I lay my head on that pillow from time to time,

274
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:03,668
但我沒有特定的居所
but I wouldn't say I live anywhere in particular.

275
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:07,410
我是大部分人口中的波西米亞人
I'm what more civilized people refer to as bohemian.

276
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:09,948
我不知道那是什麼
I don't know what that is.

277
00:34:09,979 --> 00:34:13,520
意思就是我隨時都可以捲鋪蓋離開
It means I can pack up and leave whenever I want to.

278
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:16,388
聽起來像個美夢
Sounds like a dream.

279
00:34:16,417 --> 00:34:18,917
我盡量讓夢不醒過來吧
Just as long as I can keep from waking up.

280
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,928
這是什麼片子?
What is this?

281
00:34:45,928 --> 00:34:46,550
姑娘們 要搭車嗎?

282
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,888
看就是了
Just watch.

283
00:35:19,979 --> 00:35:22,888
是不是從來沒見過這樣的電影?
Never seen anything like that before now, have you?

284
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,790
有各種各樣的地下情色片
There are all kinds of underground stag films

285
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,030
就像這部一樣
like this out there.

286
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,060
這合法嗎?
Is it legal?

287
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:33,830
做愛嗎 合法
Doing it, yeah.

288
00:35:34,928 --> 00:35:36,530
但拍攝就不了
Filming it, no.

289
00:35:37,698 --> 00:35:40,770
至少在這不合法 但有朝一日會合法的
Not here, anyway. It will be eventually.

290
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,468
人們會花一切代價來看的
People would pay an arm and a leg to see this.

291
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,908
這樣的電影會在行業里掀起革命的
Pictures like this are going to revolutionize the industry

292
00:35:46,938 --> 00:35:50,208
而我 打算早早地借此盈利
and I, for one, plan on capitalizing early.

293
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,648
這就是現實
It's reality.

294
00:35:53,678 --> 00:35:56,688
無可否認 我們都著迷於
There's no denying we all share a fascination

295
00:35:56,718 --> 00:35:59,620
看到人們真實的一面
in seeing people as they truly are.

296
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,458
我不太喜歡現實
I don't like reality.

297
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:07,729
我是指我住的地方
Where I live, I mean.

298
00:36:08,628 --> 00:36:09,799
那就離開
So leave.

299
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,580
不是那麼簡單的事
It's not that easy.

300
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,708
當然很簡單
Well, sure it is.

301
00:36:20,739 --> 00:36:21,739
這門前就有條路
There's a road right out front there

302
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,708
能夠直達紐約市
that'll take you all the way to New York City.

303
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,878
總有一天我的爸爸媽媽會不在了
One day my mother and father will be gone.

304
00:36:29,648 --> 00:36:31,620
那時我就能為所欲為了
I can do what I want then.

305
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,020
如果那時太晚了呢
What if that's too late?

306
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,560
珠兒 這件事的問題就在於
The fact and truth of the matter is, Pearl,

307
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,928
你的人生只有一次機會
you only get one take at this life.

308
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:42,299
如果你不趁年輕時好好活著
And if you don't make the most of it when you're young,

309
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:44,168
就沒法再來一次了
you don't get a second chance.

310
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:49,570
要是他們死掉就好了
If only they would just die.

311
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:54,878
什麼?
Pardon?

312
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,520
沒什麼
Nothing.

313
00:37:03,948 --> 00:37:07,290
能跟別人說說話的感覺真好
It's real nice to be able to talk to someone for a change.

314
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,830
在那個農場待得太久了
Been cooped up on that farm for so long

315
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,898
有時我都擔心會不會
sometimes I worry that maybe

316
00:37:11,928 --> 00:37:14,560
自己跟別人都不一樣了
I'm not the same as other people.

317
00:37:15,729 --> 00:37:18,698
你為什麼想要跟別人一個樣呢?
Why would you ever want to be like everybody else?

318
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,698
我不知道
I don't know.

319
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,138
感覺那樣更安寧吧
Sometimes it just seems more peaceful, I guess.

320
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,188
你之前說的是真心話嗎?
Did you mean what you said?

321
00:37:40,218 --> 00:37:42,628
說想在大銀幕上看到我?
About wanting to see me up on that screen?

322
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,300
當然了
Sure, I did.

323
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,229
為此我願意做任何事
I'd do anything to be up there.

324
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,370
這樣的話你得出國
Well, then, you ought to go overseas

325
00:37:51,398 --> 00:37:53,100
等流行病過去的
when this pandemic ends.

326
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:54,739
我就是這麼打算的
That's what I'm doing.

327
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:57,110
歐洲的藝術界更加鮮活
The arts are so much more alive in Europe.

328
00:37:57,138 --> 00:37:59,080
在那邊 你可以成為任何人
You can be whoever you want to be there.

329
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:01,677
真的嗎?
Really?

330
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:03,279
你甚至可以出演這樣的電影
You could even be in pictures like this.

331
00:38:04,678 --> 00:38:05,918
我反正很願意看你
I know I'd watch you.

332
00:38:12,388 --> 00:38:13,888
我該走了
I should go now.

333
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,760
謝謝你
Thank you.

334
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,260
謝什麼?
What for?

335
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,830
謝謝今晚能見我
For seeing me tonight.

336
00:39:48,418 --> 00:39:49,887
你在看什麼?
What are you staring at?

337
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:34,157
希達!
Theda!

338
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,770
我就要走了
I'm leaving soon.

339
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,378
我不能再在這待著了
I can't stay here any longer.

340
00:40:55,188 --> 00:40:57,250
霍華德本來該帶我走的
Howard was supposed to take me away.

341
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,259
這樣我會好受些
It'd be easier for me

342
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:03,790
不會覺得是我拋棄了你
if I didn't feel like I was abandoning you.

343
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,100
你能理解嗎?
You understand that?

344
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:16,138
我愛你 爹地 但這樣簡直不叫活著
I love you, Daddy, but this is no way to live.

345
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:21,479
珠兒?
Pearl?

346
00:41:23,448 --> 00:41:24,908
你在做什麼?
What are you doing?

347
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,320
我在跟爹地說話
Talking with Daddy.

348
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,888
我們得帶他回屋裡去
We need to get him back to the house.

349
00:41:36,989 --> 00:41:38,428
你為什麼恨我 媽媽
Why do you hate me, Mama?

350
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,270
我只是顧全大局
I only want what's best.

351
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:48,840
什麼時候才能得到我想要的?
When do I get what I want?

352
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:53,310
有一天你會明白的
One day you'll understand

353
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:56,350
你想要什麼並不重要
that getting what you want isn't what's important.

354
00:41:58,878 --> 00:42:00,918
充分利用你所有的才重要
Making the most of what you have is.

355
00:42:02,148 --> 00:42:05,188
人生很少能按你的期待發展
Life rarely turns out how you expect.

356
00:42:05,218 --> 00:42:06,520
你得做好面對這些的準備
You need to be prepared for that

357
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,290
如果你想過得幸福的話
if you ever want to be happy.

358
00:42:10,158 --> 00:42:11,388
回屋裡來吧
Come back inside.

359
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,948
你在哪?
Where are you?

360
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:47,658
別盯著我看了
Stop staring at me.

361
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,218
你怎麼找到這個的?
How'd you find that?

362
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:54,388
什麼事情我都有看在眼裡
I am not blind to what goes on around here.

363
00:44:54,418 --> 00:44:56,759
拿上你的晚飯 待在隔離房裡
Take your dinner. Stay in the bunkhouse.

364
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:58,428
但是外面那麼冷!
But it's freezing out there!

365
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:01,229
你在拿我冒險之前就該想清楚的
You should've thought of that before putting me at risk.

366
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,270
隔離到確定你沒有生病為止
Isolate yourself until we know you're not ill.

367
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,570
這樣做才對
That is what's right.

368
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:12,310
明天鎮上有一場舞蹈選拔
There's a dance audition in town tomorrow.

369
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,208
我要去
I'm going to it.

370
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,750
你不能去
No, you're not.

371
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,520
- 我要去  - 為什麼?
-Yes, I am. -Why?

372
00:45:22,688 --> 00:45:24,589
看看我的能耐到底夠不夠大
Find out if I'm good enough.

373
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,290
夠不夠做什麼 珠兒?
Good enough for what, Pearl?

374
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:34,428
不止於此的人生
Something more than this.

375
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:41,168
這些不知感恩的倔強都是哪來的?
Where does all this ungratefulness stem from?

376
00:45:41,198 --> 00:45:44,340
你覺得我們的生活與你不配嗎?
How is it you find our life so beneath you?

377
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:46,339
你從來都有屋可棲
You've always had a roof over your head,

378
00:45:46,378 --> 00:45:48,479
有食果腹
food in your belly.

379
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:50,648
你就沒想過這些都是你父親和我
Do you not think that came at great sacrifice

380
00:45:50,678 --> 00:45:52,620
做出的犧牲換來的嗎?
from your father and I?

381
00:45:52,648 --> 00:45:55,750
還是說你認為我們也配不上你?
Or do you think we are beneath you, too?

382
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:57,590
如果我的餘生注定都要
If I'm meant to live out the rest of my days

383
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,387
跟你和爹地住在這個農場
with you and Daddy on this farm,

384
00:45:59,418 --> 00:46:00,520
那就這樣吧
then so be it.

385
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,229
但我的青春只有一次
But I'm only young once.

386
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,128
如果我參加了選拔並且沒被選上
If I go to this audition and I don't get picked,

387
00:46:06,158 --> 00:46:07,360
那我就回到家
then I'll come home

388
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:10,628
而且以後再也不提了 我發誓
and I'll never speak of it again, I swear.

389
00:46:10,668 --> 00:46:12,370
但我必須要知道我盡力了
But I have to know that I tried

390
00:46:12,398 --> 00:46:14,239
不然我會後悔一輩子的
or I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life.

391
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:17,110
求你了媽媽 你不知道我的能耐
Please, Mama. You have no idea what I'm capable of.

392
00:46:18,878 --> 00:46:20,339
噢 我知道得很清楚
Oh, yes, I do.

393
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,780
我見過你在私底下做的事
I've seen the things you've done in private,

394
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,520
你以為沒人在看的時候
when you believe no one is watching.

395
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:31,819
你以為別人不會注意到嗎?
You think others won't notice?

396
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:35,590
你把你的本性永遠藏好了 珠兒
You can't keep your true self hidden forever, Pearl.

397
00:46:35,628 --> 00:46:38,628
他們最終會注意到的 而且會被嚇到的
They will notice eventually, and they will be frightened,

398
00:46:39,658 --> 00:46:41,100
就像我一樣
just as I am.

399
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,739
- 你錯了  - 是嗎?
-You're wrong. -Am I?

400
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:49,739
你想成為的是多優秀的女人啊
Then what a fine woman you hope to become,

401
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,438
扔下你的母親 獨自腐朽
leaving your mother alone to rot

402
00:46:51,468 --> 00:46:54,510
就為了能跟一群城裡的妓女跳舞
so you can dance with a bunch of city whores.

403
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,378
更別說你可能染上的疾病了
Let alone the illness you may contract and spread.

404
00:46:57,408 --> 00:46:59,320
你見過這病讓你父親變成什麼樣
You've seen what it does to your father.

405
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,350
這就是你希望自己和別人得到的下場嗎?
That's what you want for yourself and others?

406
00:47:01,378 --> 00:47:03,888
也許你希望我是這個下場
And maybe that is what you wish for me.

407
00:47:03,918 --> 00:47:06,560
- 當然不是  - 別撒謊了!
-Of course not. -Stop lying!

408
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,658
我再也忍不了聽到這些了
I can't stand the sound of it anymore!

409
00:47:08,688 --> 00:47:12,299
這跟你罪惡的行徑一樣可憎
It's almost as abhorrent as your sinful behavior!

410
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:15,529
你不正常 珠兒
You are not well, Pearl!

411
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:18,198
這樣下去遲早會傷害到別人
It's only a matter of time before you hurt someone else.

412
00:47:18,229 --> 00:47:22,510
邪惡正在蠶食你的內心 我看得出
Malevolence is festering in you, I see it.

413
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,668
而且以後我要嚴正明確
And I will not, in good conscious,

414
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,580
不再讓你離開這個農場
let you leave this farm again.

415
00:47:27,739 --> 00:47:29,510
你阻止不了我的
You can't stop me.

416
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:31,208
噢 我太可以了
Oh, yes, I can.

417
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,918
你不想知道我能對你做出什麼事的
You don't want to know what I could do to you.

418
00:47:33,948 --> 00:47:37,958
我背負著你永遠無法理解的負擔
I shoulder a burden you will never understand,

419
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:39,918
每天只能給我嫁的人餵食
spend my days feeding and wiping the snot

420
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:42,229
擦鼻涕 如此度日
off the face of the man I married.

421
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:45,560
你膽敢坐在這裡跟我談後悔?
You dare sit there and talk to me about regret?

422
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,668
我本應是他的妻子 不該給他當媽!
I was supposed to be his wife, not his mother!

423
00:47:48,698 --> 00:47:51,398
你再敢用這種口氣跟我說話試試!
Don't you ever speak that way to me again!

424
00:47:51,428 --> 00:47:52,770
你聽到了嗎?
Do you hear me?

425
00:47:53,698 --> 00:47:55,739
- 抱歉  - 你才不抱歉
-I'm sorry. -No! You're not!

426
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:57,610
不然你就會停止這種行為了
Or you would stop all this!

427
00:47:57,638 --> 00:47:59,239
給 拿著
Here! Take it!

428
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,350
這就是你想要的 是不是?
That's what you really desire, isn't it?

429
00:48:02,378 --> 00:48:04,918
也許我該為你殺了他?
Perhaps I should kill him for you?

430
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:07,418
這樣你就不用再繼續照顧他了
That way you don't have to care for him any longer.

431
00:48:07,448 --> 00:48:10,418
這是不是圓了你自私的夢想?
Would that suit your selfish dreams better?

432
00:48:10,448 --> 00:48:12,590
那樣我們倆都可以去舞蹈選拔了
Then we can both go to the dance audition!

433
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,989
你的丈夫不在了 我的也一樣
Your husband is gone. So is mine.

434
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:16,790
所以我們何必被照顧他們所束縛
Why should we be saddled with caring for them

435
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:18,428
或者被農場拖累?
or the work of this farm?

436
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:21,330
不如我們都去追求自己的願望!
What about us getting what we want?

437
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:31,540
我不要再為你受任何苦了
I won't suffer for you any longer.

438
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:34,780
你想走嗎 走吧
You want to leave? Go.

439
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,378
但當你失敗
But when you fail...

440
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:39,520
而且你必定會失敗
And you will fail...

441
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:42,918
我要你記住那是什麼感覺
I want you to remember what it feels like

442
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:49,260
因為我每次看到你 都是這個感覺
because that's how I feel every time I look at you.

443
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:53,360
我的一切幾乎都被奪走了 珠兒
Nearly everything I ever had has been taken from me, Pearl.

444
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,000
你還想要什麼?
What more do you want?

445
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,040
我只是不想淪落成你這樣
I just don't want to end up like you, is all.

446
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:15,648
我恨你!
I hate you!

447
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,418
你這娼妓!
You harlot!

448
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:21,760
我不會再讓你當著我的面趾高氣揚
I won't let you your arrogance in my face!

449
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:24,860
- 你並不比我強!  - 我就是比你強
-You are not better than me! -Yes, I am!

450
00:49:24,898 --> 00:49:27,029
我要成為大明星
I'm going to be a star!

451
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,799
全世界都要知道我的大名!
The whole world is going to know my name!

452
00:52:06,888 --> 00:52:09,489
你要去哪裡 現在都還沒到早上六點
Where are you going? It's not even 6:00 a.m. yet.

453
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:11,128
我要去練習
I have to practice my routine.

454
00:52:11,158 --> 00:52:13,760
今天的選拔必須準備充分
I need to be perfect for my audition today.

455
00:52:16,729 --> 00:52:18,870
你還認為我夠漂亮嗎?
You still think I'm pretty enough?

456
00:52:18,898 --> 00:52:21,198
過去24小時內沒什麼變化
Oh, not much has changed in the last 24 hours.

457
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:22,810
還是有變化的
Yes, it has.

458
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,678
你上次忘記了這個
Oh. You forgot this last time.

459
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,979
很高興你能回來
I'm glad you came back.

460
00:52:31,878 --> 00:52:33,819
我也是
So am I.

461
00:52:39,218 --> 00:52:40,958
至少讓我載你回家吧
Let me at least drive you home.

462
00:52:54,138 --> 00:52:55,739
是你認識的人嗎?
Somebody you know?

463
00:52:58,908 --> 00:53:00,638
我不太確定
I'm not really sure.

464
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:03,678
確實
Well...

465
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:05,218
現在很難認出誰是誰
It's hard to know who anyone is nowadays

466
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,120
大家臉上都遮著蓋著
with all these masks people are wearing.

467
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:39,148
在這稍等一下
Wait here a minute.

468
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:04,239
爹地 我真對不起
Daddy, I'm so sorry.

469
00:54:25,688 --> 00:54:27,657
我很快就給你清理乾淨好嗎
I'm going to get you cleaned up real soon, okay?

470
00:54:27,698 --> 00:54:28,928
只是我現在有個客人
I just have a guest right now.

471
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:00,729
好了 進來吧
Okay, come in!

472
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,250
這是我父親
This is my father.

473
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:25,888
很高興見到您 先生
Pleased to meet you, sir.

474
00:55:34,128 --> 00:55:35,898
想去我的房間嗎?
Want to go up to my bedroom now?

475
00:55:42,708 --> 00:55:44,770
我想要永遠離開這個農場
I want off this farm forever.

476
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,378
但是這裡看起來還不賴
I don't know. It doesn't seem so bad.

477
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:51,350
確實不賴
It is.

478
00:55:52,448 --> 00:55:55,418
那是怎麼回事?
What was that?

479
00:55:55,448 --> 00:55:57,918
沒什麼
Nothing.

480
00:55:57,948 --> 00:56:00,320
再跟我講講歐洲
Tell me more about Europe.

481
00:56:01,188 --> 00:56:02,427
我們什麼時候可以去?
When can we go?

482
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:06,300
你不想去查看一下嗎?
Don't you think you should go check?

483
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:08,398
不想
No.

484
00:56:10,898 --> 00:56:12,270
行了 很抱歉
All right. I'm sorry.

485
00:56:12,938 --> 00:56:13,968
但是不管什麼動靜
Whatever that is,

486
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,698
我們不能當沒聽見
we can't just ignore it.

487
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,208
萬一是你爸爸有什麼事呢
It could be your father, for Christ's sake.

488
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:19,080
不是我爸爸
It's not my father.

489
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:21,979
求你別走
Please don't go.

490
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:24,750
你是怎麼回事?
What's the matter with you?

491
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:27,820
沒什麼
Nothing.

492
00:57:18,438 --> 00:57:20,370
是我們家的狗
It's our dog.

493
00:57:20,398 --> 00:57:22,208
趁我不在她把廚房搞得一團糟
She made a mess in the kitchen while I was away,

494
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:23,540
我把她鎖在地窖里了
so I put her in the root cellar.

495
00:57:26,408 --> 00:57:27,908
我想給你看點東西
I want to show you something.

496
00:57:34,948 --> 00:57:36,320
這是查莉
That's Charlie!

497
00:57:37,148 --> 00:57:39,418
她總是很餓
She's always hungry.

498
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:41,958
我們沒錢像以前那樣餵飽她
We can't afford to feed her like we used to.

499
00:57:41,989 --> 00:57:45,030
這邊這位是瑪麗
And over here, this is Mary.

500
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,330
她是不是很可愛
Ain't she a dish?

501
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:50,530
這是弗蘭西斯
This is Francis.

502
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,540
他們都是我最棒的觀眾
They're my best audience.

503
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:57,438
我用最喜歡的電影明星給他們起名
I named each of them after my favorite picture stars.

504
00:57:57,468 --> 00:58:01,040
多年以來我給他們表演過無數次
I've put on so many shows for them over the years.

505
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,110
很傷心要道別 但就像人們說的
It'll be sad to say goodbye, but like they say,

506
00:58:03,148 --> 00:58:04,479
在演藝圈就像逆水行舟
"If you're not moving forward in show business,

507
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:05,780
不進則退
"you're moving backwards."

508
00:58:06,878 --> 00:58:08,888
我們以前養著更多的牲口
We used to have many more animals,

509
00:58:09,918 --> 00:58:11,120
但它們都死了
but they all died.

510
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:13,820
那你的狗呢?
What about your dog?

511
00:58:15,489 --> 00:58:18,090
- 狗叫什麼名字?  - 我們沒養狗
-What's its name? -We don't have a dog.

512
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:22,198
我以為你說有狗的?
I thought you said you, uh, did?

513
00:58:22,229 --> 00:58:23,800
在地窖里?
In the cellar?

514
00:58:27,138 --> 00:58:31,138
哦對
Right. Yeah.

515
00:58:31,168 --> 00:58:35,208
這個 呃...
Yeah, well, um...

516
00:58:36,178 --> 00:58:38,850
天啊
Oh, boy.

517
00:58:38,878 --> 00:58:41,049
這個 我該往回走了
Oh, I better be getting back, you know?

518
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:45,218
- 什麼?  - 我得走了
-What? -Oh, I've got to go

519
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,388
還要放映日場電影
and screen the matinee, you know,

520
00:58:46,418 --> 00:58:48,020
你還得練習呢 記得嗎?
but you gotta practice, remember?

521
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:49,560
你得讓舞步更加完美
You gotta get those dance moves perfect.

522
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:51,560
現在絕對不是
Now's not the time to be

523
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:53,300
松懈休息的時候對吧?
resting on your laurels, is it?

524
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:57,198
能見你很高興 珠兒
Nice seeing you, Pearl.

525
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:03,010
我做錯什麼事了嗎?
Did I do something wrong?

526
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,040
沒有
No.

527
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:10,080
那你為什麼忽然對我冷淡了?
Then why did you just go cold on me?

528
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,020
我不懂你意思
I don't know what you mean.

529
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,188
你看到什麼了?
What did you see?

530
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:18,958
我什麼都沒看到
I didn't see anything.

531
00:59:21,158 --> 00:59:23,158
你在撒謊
You're lying.

532
00:59:23,188 --> 00:59:25,330
- 我沒撒謊  - 你在撒謊
-No, I'm not. -Yes, you are.

533
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:29,968
我很清楚 我的感知非常深刻
I know because I feel things very deeply.

534
00:59:31,428 --> 00:59:33,100
聽著 我得回去工作了 好嗎?
Look, I've got to get back to work, all right?

535
00:59:33,138 --> 00:59:34,540
- 我們晚點再見  - 什麼時候?
-I'll... I'll see you later. -When?

536
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:37,010
- 什麼?  - 什麼時候再見?
-What? -When will I see you?

537
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,070
我不知道 珠兒 這只是種說法
I don't know, Pearl. It's just an expression.

538
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:39,438
你不會帶我去歐洲了 是嗎?
You're not going to take me to Europe, are you?

539
00:59:39,479 --> 00:59:40,479
跟我講實話
Tell me the truth.

540
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:44,448
我做錯什麼了?
What did I do wrong?

541
00:59:44,479 --> 00:59:45,648
- 沒什麼 冷靜點  - 不!
- Nothing. Calm down. - No!

542
00:59:45,678 --> 00:59:48,418
我沒做錯的話 你為什麼要離開我?
Why are you leaving me if I didn't do anything wrong?

543
00:59:48,448 --> 00:59:50,489
我不明白 我以為你喜歡我
I don't understand! I thought you liked me!

544
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,620
- 我確實喜歡你 只是...  - 那就告訴我實話!
-I do like you. I just... -Tell me the truth!

545
00:59:53,658 --> 00:59:55,188
你為什麼要離開? 你看到什麼了?
Why are you leaving me? What did you see?

546
00:59:55,229 --> 00:59:56,290
你為什麼變了?
Why did you change?

547
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:58,158
你嚇到我了 珠兒
You're scaring me, Pearl.

548
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:00,458
好嗎?
Okay?

549
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:05,168
我希望你的選拔能夠順利
I wish you the best of luck with your audition.

550
01:00:05,198 --> 01:00:06,398
真心的
Sincerely.

551
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:31,360
你不能把我扔在這!
You're not gonna leave me here!

552
01:00:31,388 --> 01:00:34,300
我不要再待在這個農場了!
I'm not staying on this farm!

553
01:00:37,168 --> 01:00:40,069
什麼都不能把我困在這!
Nothing's going to keep me here!

554
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:51,110
你聽到了嗎?
You hear me?

555
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:54,218
什麼都不行!
Nothing!

556
01:00:57,418 --> 01:00:59,759
你不行! 霍華德也不行!
Not you! Not Howard!

557
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:02,590
媽媽也不行! 誰都不行!
Not Mama! Nobody!

558
01:01:11,198 --> 01:01:12,739
不 不
No. No.

559
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,520
我要你記住這是什麼感覺
I want you to remember what it feels like.

560
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,229
因為這就是每次你看向我時 我的感覺
'Cause that's how I felt every time you looked at me.

561
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:48,638
好了 爹地
Okay, Daddy.

562
01:01:48,668 --> 01:01:50,310
趕緊給你清理乾淨
Let's get you cleaned up.

563
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:23,608
我希望你別再那樣看我
I wish you wouldn't look at me like that.

564
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:58,708
你覺得如何
What do you think?

565
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:31,270
謝謝你做的一切
Thank you for everything.

566
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:35,610
我知道你會在上天自豪地看著我的
I know you'll look down on me proudly.

567
01:03:43,188 --> 01:03:44,718
我是愛你的
You are loved.

568
01:04:05,678 --> 01:04:08,610
永別了 可憐的強尼
Au revoir, poor Johnny!

569
01:04:50,389 --> 01:04:52,620
謝天謝地你來了
Oh, thank goodness you came.

570
01:04:52,658 --> 01:04:54,560
我還以為你不會露面了
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.

571
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:56,290
抱歉
Sorry.

572
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:58,489
家裡有些雜事需要處理
I had some chores to do around the house.

573
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:01,229
我自己一人快要緊張壞了
Well, I've been in such a flap all by myself.

574
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:02,770
我的感覺比我想象中
I feel worse than I imagine I would

575
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,898
得流感的感覺還要糟糕
had I contracted that awful flu.

576
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,468
箱子里是什麼?
What's in the suitcases?

577
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,708
是我一路上需要帶的行李
All my things I need for going on the road.

578
01:05:10,739 --> 01:05:12,938
哇 你可真有信心
Wow. You're confident.

579
01:05:14,878 --> 01:05:18,448
傳言說他們每個鎮子只選一個姑娘
Rumor has it they may only be taking one gal per town.

580
01:05:20,479 --> 01:05:21,750
必須得選我
It has to be me.

581
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:28,489
這話你不該大聲講出來的 珠兒
I don't think you meant to say that out loud, Pearl.

582
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:31,530
如果我不是我 那我希望是你 好嗎?
Well, if it's not me, then I hope it's you, right?

583
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:33,560
必須得選我
It has to be me.

584
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:40,000
下一位
Next.

585
01:05:52,678 --> 01:05:54,320
那是多蘿西·柯林斯
That's Dorothy Collins.

586
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,759
真沒法為她悲傷
Can't say I'm too saddened for her.

587
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:03,358
有些人就以為自己是天賜瑰寶
Some people just think they're God's gift, you know?

588
01:06:03,389 --> 01:06:06,000
但他們最後總是難逃命運
But they always get what's coming to them eventually.

589
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:11,570
說實話 這麼講話不太好
I feel bad saying that, actually.

590
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,668
她是個護士
She's a nurse.

591
01:06:13,698 --> 01:06:16,040
我真想不出要怎麼做護士的工作
I don't know how to do something like that.

592
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:18,468
珠兒 我太緊張了
Oh, Pearl. I'm so nervous.

593
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:20,378
如果剛一上台就笑話我怎麼辦
What if they laugh me right off stage?

594
01:06:20,408 --> 01:06:22,010
那樣我可接受不了
I don't think I could handle that.

595
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,049
你怎麼都不害怕的?
How are you not scared?

596
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,948
我想可能是習慣了一直害怕吧
I guess I'm just more used to the feeling.

597
01:06:36,628 --> 01:06:37,790
下一位
Next.

598
01:06:53,908 --> 01:06:55,438
天啊
Oh, Lord.

599
01:07:04,448 --> 01:07:06,389
跟我換位置吧
Switch places with me.

600
01:07:06,418 --> 01:07:08,520
我可能做不到了 我太緊張
I don't think I can do this. I'm too frightened.

601
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,458
- 什麼?  - 來吧 珠兒
-What? -Come on, Pearl.

602
01:07:10,489 --> 01:07:12,958
趁他們開門之前換個位置
Switch before they open the doors again.

603
01:07:13,928 --> 01:07:16,370
來吧 過去
Come on. Move.

604
01:07:20,968 --> 01:07:22,810
謝謝你
Thank you.

605
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:25,340
你是個好朋友
You're a good friend.

606
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:31,648
我是嗎?
Am I?

607
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:35,378
當然了
Of course you are.

608
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,989
親家姐妹就得抱團 對吧?
Sister-in-laws have to stick together, right?

609
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:13,658
下一位
Next.

610
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,430
到你了 珠兒
Your turn, Pearl.

611
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:18,857
是時候展現你的本事了
Time to show them what you can do.

612
01:08:18,898 --> 01:08:20,528
我會讓他們見識的
I'm gonna show them all.

613
01:08:21,229 --> 01:08:22,700
祝你好運
Break a leg.

614
01:09:25,898 --> 01:09:27,229
準備好了嗎 小姐?
Ready, miss?

615
01:11:25,418 --> 01:11:26,918
謝謝你
Thank you.

616
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:30,250
但很遺憾你不行
But it's gonna be a no.

617
01:11:45,938 --> 01:11:48,208
什麼?
Pardon?

618
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:51,168
抱歉 你不是我們想找的人
Sorry, you're just not what we had in mind.

619
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:02,818
可那是我跳過最棒的一支舞
Well, that was the best dancing I've ever done.

620
01:12:04,219 --> 01:12:07,290
是的 跳得挺好
Yes, it was very nice.

621
01:12:07,318 --> 01:12:10,990
但是舞團里已經有很多像你一樣的姑娘了
But we already have plenty of gals like you in the troupe.

622
01:12:11,029 --> 01:12:13,958
我們今天想找個不一樣的人
We're looking for something different today.

623
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,438
懂嗎 更"全美明星"一點
You know? More all-American,

624
01:12:18,469 --> 01:12:20,168
更年輕 金髮的
younger and blonde.

625
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:23,708
帶有明星潛質的
Someone with X factor.

626
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:28,349
什麼?
What?

627
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,219

Next!

628
01:12:38,188 --> 01:12:39,719
來吧
Come on.

629
01:12:40,358 --> 01:12:41,719
- 來吧  - 不
-Come on. -No.

630
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:45,458
恐怕不行
I'm afraid so.

631
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:48,000
來吧 小姐 該走了
Come on, miss. Time to go.

632
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,140
求求你們
Please.

633
01:12:55,168 --> 01:12:57,269
你們不明白 我需要這個機會
You don't understand. I need this.

634
01:12:57,310 --> 01:13:00,740
下一位 謝謝
Next in line, please.

635
01:13:00,779 --> 01:13:02,250
我可以做得更好
I can make it better.

636
01:13:02,279 --> 01:13:03,378
來吧 親愛的
Come on now, darling.

637
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:06,317
別鬧得沒法收場了
You don't want to make a scene and spoil everything.

638
01:13:06,350 --> 01:13:09,318
拜託了 再給我一次機會
Please! Just give me one more chance.

639
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:12,290
- 來吧  - 不要
-Come on, now. -No.

640
01:13:13,219 --> 01:13:14,790
我是...我是明星
I'm a... I'm a star.

641
01:13:16,029 --> 01:13:18,857
來吧 小姐 很遺憾
Come on. Come on, miss. I'm sorry.

642
01:13:18,898 --> 01:13:21,128
- 該走了  - 我是個明星!
-It's time to go. -No, I'm a star!

643
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,229
來吧
Come on.

644
01:13:24,068 --> 01:13:28,740
拜託 我是個明星!
Please! I'm a star!

645
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:30,410
很遺憾 該走了
I'm sorry. It's time to go.

646
01:13:30,438 --> 01:13:32,838
拜託 有人幫幫我嗎!
Please, somebody help me!

647
01:13:32,878 --> 01:13:36,378
拜託! 救救我!
Please! Help me! Help me!

648
01:13:37,979 --> 01:13:39,719
不!
No!

649
01:14:17,490 --> 01:14:18,790
珠兒?
Pearl?

650
01:14:21,219 --> 01:14:22,358
珠兒?
Pearl?

651
01:14:27,128 --> 01:14:28,898
我帶你回家吧?
How about I take you home?

652
01:14:58,529 --> 01:15:00,160
那是我們送的豬嗎?
Is that our pig?

653
01:15:18,878 --> 01:15:20,378
要我去找你媽媽來嗎?
Should I go and fetch your mother?

654
01:15:21,918 --> 01:15:23,349
不了
No.

655
01:15:29,588 --> 01:15:32,160
不如我給你弄點好喝的吧?
How about I get you something nice to drink?

656
01:15:35,128 --> 01:15:36,500
媽媽是對的
Mama was right.

657
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,870
我永遠沒法離開這個農場了
I'm never getting off this farm.

658
01:15:42,008 --> 01:15:43,370
那你離開又想去哪呢?
And where would you want to go?

659
01:15:44,668 --> 01:15:46,508
-  去歐洲  - 歐洲?
-Europe. -Europe?

660
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:49,008
那是為什麼?
What on earth for?

661
01:15:49,048 --> 01:15:50,180
歐洲遍地廢墟了
It'll be in ruins

662
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:52,519
霍華德絕對不肯回去那邊的
and you'll never get Howard back there, I'll tell you.

663
01:15:55,088 --> 01:15:56,450
別這樣嘛
Oh, come on, now.

664
01:15:56,490 --> 01:15:57,450
我知道你很失望
I know you're disappointed,

665
01:15:57,490 --> 01:16:00,120
但是沒必要這麼難過
but there's no sense in taking it this hard.

666
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:02,430
不過是個教堂的舞團而已
It's just a lousy old church group.

667
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:04,958
都是些外行
Those old dolts,

668
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:09,099
他們根本不懂什麼是專業的舞蹈
they don't know the first thing about quality dancing.

669
01:16:10,168 --> 01:16:12,200
你不明白
You don't understand.

670
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:13,599
不明白什麼?
What don't I?

671
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:15,410
說吧 珠兒
Come on, Pearl.

672
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:17,438
到底怎麼回事?
What's really the matter?

673
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,410
我感覺
I don't feel

674
01:16:23,708 --> 01:16:25,080
很不好
well.

675
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:29,647
你不是染上什麼病了吧?
You're not coming down with something, are you?

676
01:16:29,688 --> 01:16:31,219
沒有
No.

677
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:32,490
不是那樣的事
It's nothing like that.

678
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,088
謝天謝地
Oh, thank goodness.

679
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,430
如果我偷偷溜走
If I snuck out of the house

680
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:38,330
結果帶了一身病菌回到家
and ended up bringing home nothing but the germ,

681
01:16:38,358 --> 01:16:41,128
我爸爸媽媽會殺了我的
my mother and father would just kill me.

682
01:16:43,229 --> 01:16:45,100
我擔心可能我身上可能
I'm worried there may be something

683
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:47,068
有什麼嚴重的毛病 米斯蒂
real wrong with me, Mitsy.

684
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:50,310
你是什麼意思?
How do you mean?

685
01:16:51,508 --> 01:16:54,008
就好像我身上缺了點什麼
Seems like there's something missing in me

686
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,080
別的所有人都有的東西
that the rest of the world has.

687
01:16:57,608 --> 01:16:59,120
你跟霍華德講過嗎?
Have you told Howard?

688
01:17:00,979 --> 01:17:04,719
我從來沒跟任何人講出來過
I've never spoken about it out loud to anyone.

689
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:07,660
我很怕人們會怎麼想
So afraid of what people might think.

690
01:17:07,688 --> 01:17:09,060
珠兒
Pearl...

691
01:17:10,529 --> 01:17:12,429
霍華德是你的丈夫
Howard's your husband.

692
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:15,469
他喜歡你
He adores you.

693
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:18,168
你不該害怕告訴他你的感受
You shouldn't be afraid to tell him how you feel.

694
01:17:19,438 --> 01:17:22,008
我害怕我可能說的話
I'm scared of what I might say.

695
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,410
那就先對我練習一下
Well, practice on me first, then.

696
01:17:25,108 --> 01:17:26,580
假裝我就是霍華德
Pretend I'm Howard,

697
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:29,410
說出你心裡任何想說的
and you just say whatever's on your mind.

698
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:31,349
- 我說不出  - 你當然可以
-I can't. -Yes, you can.

699
01:17:32,418 --> 01:17:33,479
來吧 都講出來
Go on. Get it all out.

700
01:17:35,318 --> 01:17:37,548
- 真的?  - 沒錯
-Really? -Yes.

701
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:39,290
相信我
Trust me.

702
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,068
霍華德...
Howard...

703
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:00,740
講出來 珠兒
Go ahead, Pearl.

704
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:10,219
我真恨你把我丟在這裡
I hate you so much for leaving me here,

705
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:12,188
有時我希望你死了
sometimes I hope you die.

706
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:17,729
抱歉
I'm sorry.

707
01:18:17,758 --> 01:18:20,729
承認這一點讓我感覺很糟糕 但這是事實
I feel awful admitting that, but it's the truth.

708
01:18:23,729 --> 01:18:25,100
我對其他男人
I was curious

709
01:18:26,398 --> 01:18:27,600
感到好奇
about other men.

710
01:18:29,469 --> 01:18:31,108
我敢說你不想聽說
I'm sure you don't want to hear about

711
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:32,740
有陌生人來滿足你的妻子
a stranger satisfying your wife,

712
01:18:32,779 --> 01:18:34,679
我發誓只有那一次
and I swear it was only once.

713
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:37,279
那是個錯誤
It was a mistake.

714
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:40,279
他並不是我想要的 我現在明白了
It wasn't him that I wanted. I know that now.

715
01:18:40,318 --> 01:18:42,048
我希望一切能夠回到
And I wish things could just go back

716
01:18:42,088 --> 01:18:43,490
以前的樣子
to the way they were before,

717
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,358
但我想不出要怎麼回去
but I don't see how they could,

718
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:49,258
我所做的事無法輓回
not after the things I've done.

719
01:18:52,858 --> 01:18:55,469
你還做了什麼事 珠兒?
What else have you done, Pearl?

720
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,469
噢 霍華德
Oh, Howard.

721
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,798
我才發現這些聽起來是什麼樣
I realize how this all must sound.

722
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:03,370
說真的 有段時間我受寵若驚
Honestly, there was a time I was flattered

723
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:06,378
能有你這樣英俊的人青睞我
to have someone as handsome as you pine over me.

724
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:08,548
你真是個好人 我知道的
You're such a good person. I know that.

725
01:19:09,850 --> 01:19:12,779
我一直注意留心你的心思
I made sure to always be mindful with your heart.

726
01:19:12,818 --> 01:19:15,318
我絕不希望你感到嫉妒
I never wanted you to feel jealous.

727
01:19:16,648 --> 01:19:18,790
這是種可怕的感受 像潰爛
It's an awful feeling like a rot,

728
01:19:18,818 --> 01:19:22,729
會在你的內心扭曲翻騰
the way it just twists and turns at your insides.

729
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,830
我太瞭解那種痛楚了
I know that aching so well.

730
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:27,660
我能感覺到
I feel it.

731
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:31,229
每次看到別人順風順水都是
Whenever I see others whose lives come easy

732
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,508
因為事實上 我不是個好人
because the truth is, I'm not really a good person.

733
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:37,979
珠兒 我覺得我該...
Pearl, I think I should just...

734
01:19:38,008 --> 01:19:40,708
我從不打量其他男人的原因
The reason I kept my eyes to the ground around other men

735
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:42,508
從來不是不想傷害你
was never to avoid hurting you.

736
01:19:44,608 --> 01:19:46,779
而是我明白我有多幸運
It's because I understood how lucky I was

737
01:19:46,818 --> 01:19:49,188
能夠得到你的關注
to have your attention.

738
01:19:49,219 --> 01:19:52,758
我也許是個可憐的農場姑娘 但我並不笨
I may be a poor farm girl, Howard, but I'm not stupid.

739
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:56,458
你來到我家農場的第一天我就注意到了
I spotted you the moment you came to live with us.

740
01:19:56,490 --> 01:19:58,599
你像其他農工一樣努力
You worked hard like the other farmhands,

741
01:19:58,628 --> 01:20:00,357
但你不一樣
but you were different.

742
01:20:00,398 --> 01:20:02,430
你是有背景的
You're from somewhere.

743
01:20:02,469 --> 01:20:04,200
來自美好 安逸的地方
A nice, comfortable place

744
01:20:04,229 --> 01:20:06,600
你隨時想回都可以回去
that you could return to whenever you wanted.

745
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:11,208
我真渴望能那樣
I'm so desperate to have that.

746
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:15,310
我的一輩子 都想離開這個農場
All my life, I've wanted off this farm

747
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:17,279
而你就是我離開的機會
and you were my ticket out.

748
01:20:18,548 --> 01:20:20,148
所以...
So...

749
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:23,548
我決定永遠不能讓你看到我真實的一面
I made sure to never let you see who I really was.

750
01:20:23,588 --> 01:20:26,160
這一招非常好用
It worked like a charm, too.

751
01:20:26,188 --> 01:20:28,560
後來你終於把我帶回去
Then when you finally brought me back

752
01:20:28,588 --> 01:20:30,358
回了老家見了你的家人
to your home to meet your family,

753
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:31,830
就像我希望的一樣
it was just as I hoped.

754
01:20:33,628 --> 01:20:35,700
彷彿是畫里走出來的生活
A life straight out of the pictures.

755
01:20:37,568 --> 01:20:39,700
至少給我的感覺是這樣的
At least that's what it felt like to me.

756
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:43,508
而你卻不想要
And you didn't want it.

757
01:20:46,838 --> 01:20:48,608
你只想留在這裡 在我們的農場
You just wanted to stay here on our farm,

758
01:20:48,648 --> 01:20:50,479
而這真的讓我好憤怒
and that made me so angry.

759
01:20:51,608 --> 01:20:52,950
你怎麼可以這樣?
How could you?

760
01:20:52,979 --> 01:20:56,188
我確信你知道我討厭這 你一定是的
I'm certain you knew I hated it, you must've.

761
01:20:56,219 --> 01:20:58,290
你怎麼可以如此自私 而殘忍
How could you be so selfish and cruel

762
01:20:58,318 --> 01:21:00,358
而我如此努力讓你感到幸福?
after all I've done to make you happy?

763
01:21:05,729 --> 01:21:08,430
我甚至懷上了你的孩子
I was even pregnant with your baby.

764
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:16,567
我從來都不想做一名母親
I never wanted to be a mother.

765
01:21:16,608 --> 01:21:20,279
我憎惡有東西在我體內生長的感覺
I loathed the feeling of it growing inside me.

766
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:21,878
那感覺像病症
It felt like sickness.

767
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:27,849
拉扯著 吮吸著我 像穀倉里粘人的牲口
Pulling and sucking on me like some needy animal in a barn.

768
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:31,890
我怎麼能為另一個生命負責?
How could I be responsible for another life?

769
01:21:32,858 --> 01:21:34,758
生命讓我害怕
Life terrifies me.

770
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:37,628
嚴酷 慘淡 又讓人耗盡精力
It's harsh, and bleak, and draining.

771
01:21:39,898 --> 01:21:42,370
當胎兒死去時我大松一口氣
I was so relieved when it died.

772
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:44,330
把我困在這裡的負擔又少了一點
It was one less weight keeping me trapped here,

773
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:46,798
但戰爭開始了 你也離開了我
but then the war came and you left me, too.

774
01:21:47,810 --> 01:21:49,938
你為什麼離開我 霍華德?
Why did you leave me, Howard?

775
01:21:56,508 --> 01:21:58,350
我討厭這樣的感覺
I hate feeling like this.

776
01:21:58,918 --> 01:22:01,317
如此可悲
So pathetic.

777
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:03,719
你們那樣的人會有這種感覺嗎?
Do people like you ever feel this way?

778
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:05,588
我猜你不會有
I figure you don't.

779
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:07,758
你看起來時刻都很完美
You seem so perfect all the time.

780
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:10,430
上帝一定對你非常慷慨
Lord must've been generous to you.

781
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:12,857
他從未回應過我的祈禱
He never answers any of my prayers.

782
01:22:12,898 --> 01:22:15,398
我也不知道為什麼 我做錯了什麼?
I don't know why. What did I do?

783
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:17,500
我到底有什麼毛病?
What is wrong with me?

784
01:22:17,529 --> 01:22:19,740
求求你告訴我 沒准我能有所好轉
Please, just tell me so maybe I can get better.

785
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:21,338
我不想淪落成我媽媽
I don't want to end up like Mama.

786
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:23,040
我想要在大銀幕上跳舞
I want to be dancing up on the screen

787
01:22:23,068 --> 01:22:25,270
像電影里的漂亮姑娘
like the pretty gals in the pictures.

788
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:29,310
我真的好想像她們一樣
I want what they have so badly,

789
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:30,878
完美無瑕
to be perfect,

790
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:33,580
被許許多多的人愛著
to be loved from as many people as possible

791
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:36,349
能夠補償我受折磨的那些時間
to make up for all my time spent suffering.

792
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:41,020
有時我在半夜醒過來
Sometimes I wake in the middle of the night

793
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:43,990
那種恐懼席捲著我 如果命該如此呢?
and the fear washes over me, 'cause what if this is it?

794
01:22:46,358 --> 01:22:48,000
如果我只屬於這裡怎麼辦?
What if this is right where I belong?

795
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:54,910
我是個失敗者
I'm a failure.

796
01:22:56,338 --> 01:22:57,469
我不漂亮
I'm not pretty

797
01:22:58,979 --> 01:23:01,410
本性也不快樂或隨和
or naturally pleasant, or friendly.

798
01:23:02,008 --> 01:23:03,479
我不聰明
I'm not smart,

799
01:23:04,108 --> 01:23:05,918
也不風趣 也不自信
or funny, or confident.

800
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:10,750
我正是媽媽口中的樣子 懦弱
I'm exactly what Mama said I was, weak.

801
01:23:12,088 --> 01:23:14,490
我不知道為什麼 我做了什麼?
I don't know why. What did I do?

802
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:16,358
為什麼我的家庭不能像你一樣?
Why wasn't my family like yours?

803
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:19,430
我真討厭不能做你 只能做自己的感覺
I hate what it feels like to be me and not you.

804
01:23:19,458 --> 01:23:21,397
我真害怕當你回家之後
I'm so scared that when you finally come home,

805
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:22,700
你會看透我 然後害怕我
you'll see me and be frightened

806
01:23:22,729 --> 01:23:24,469
就像其他人一樣
like everyone else is.

807
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:29,769
我知道我做過什麼
I know what I've done,

808
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:31,008
那些壞事
the bad things,

809
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:36,450
糟糕的 令人發指的事情
terrible, awful, murderous things.

810
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:38,918
我現在很後悔 但我喜歡那種感覺
I regret them now, but I liked how they felt.

811
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:40,779
我不希望這樣 但我確實喜歡
I wish I didn't, but I did.

812
01:23:42,588 --> 01:23:45,719
起初只是比我更小的動物
At first, it was only animals smaller than myself.

813
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:47,758
沒什麼靈性的動物
Nothing with feelings.

814
01:23:47,790 --> 01:23:49,358
沒法反抗傷到我的動物
Nothing that could hurt me back.

815
01:23:50,588 --> 01:23:51,688
感覺很好
It felt good.

816
01:23:52,758 --> 01:23:54,560
殺戮比你想象得要簡單
Killing's easier than you think,

817
01:23:55,969 --> 01:23:57,398
直到最近對媽媽
till recently with Mama

818
01:23:57,430 --> 01:23:58,838
還有電影院的那個男孩
and the boy from the picture house.

819
01:23:58,870 --> 01:23:59,938
他們感覺不一樣
They were different.

820
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:02,567
他們有著更大的意義
They were more meaningful.

821
01:24:02,608 --> 01:24:04,438
我傷害他們 是為了讓他們知道
I hurt them so they too might know

822
01:24:04,469 --> 01:24:05,580
受折磨是什麼感覺
what it feels like to suffer,

823
01:24:05,608 --> 01:24:07,080
但可憐的爹地命不該這樣
but poor Daddy didn't deserve that.

824
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:09,378
我真後悔自己做的事
I wish I hadn't done what I did.

825
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:13,520
媽媽本意是好的
Mama meant well.

826
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:16,950
她一生過得很苦
She had a hard life.

827
01:24:16,990 --> 01:24:18,790
她只想要個有安全感的家
She only wanted a home to feel safe in.

828
01:24:18,818 --> 01:24:19,918
我能明白
I can see that.

829
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:21,858
我以為我恨她
I thought I hated her,

830
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:23,660
但我也是在尋求安全感罷了
but I just want to feel safe, too.

831
01:24:28,628 --> 01:24:29,700
天啊
Lord...

832
01:24:30,969 --> 01:24:33,838
我真是搞了一團糟
I made such a mess of things.

833
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,108
我不知道我還能承受多少
I don't know how much more I can take.

834
01:24:38,979 --> 01:24:40,479
我得打理好這一切
I need to clean this up.

835
01:24:41,608 --> 01:24:43,850
所有事情
All of it.

836
01:24:43,878 --> 01:24:46,817
我得在你下次見到我前處理好
I need to make things right before you see me again.

837
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,148
也許我能讓這個農場
Maybe if I can turn this farm

838
01:24:50,188 --> 01:24:51,918
成為你想要的 我們的家
into a home for us like you wanted,

839
01:24:51,958 --> 01:24:53,790
一切終於能發生改變
things will finally be different.

840
01:24:53,818 --> 01:24:56,560
我能原諒
I can forgive.

841
01:24:57,458 --> 01:24:59,059
我可以成為你想要的樣子
I can be who you want me to be

842
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:01,660
只要你能留在我身邊
if you'll just stay with me.

843
01:25:03,068 --> 01:25:04,798
你願意嗎 求求你?
Would you do that, please?

844
01:25:07,668 --> 01:25:09,639
我不能再獨自一人了
I can't be all by myself anymore.

845
01:25:09,668 --> 01:25:10,740
這太難了
It's too hard.

846
01:25:15,208 --> 01:25:17,048
我們可以愛著對方
We can love each other.

847
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:19,019
我願意為你這樣
I'll do that for you

848
01:25:19,048 --> 01:25:22,188
如果你是認真發誓"直至死亡將我們分離"
if you really meant all that "till death do us part."

849
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:25,719
那就夠了
It'd be enough,

850
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:30,588
這個農場 只有你和我
just you and me here on this farm.

851
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,567
我只希望有人愛我
All I really want is to be loved.

852
01:25:43,208 --> 01:25:45,910
最近我真的過得很難
I'm having such a hard time without it lately.

853
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:25,608
我應該走了
I should probably get going now.

854
01:26:25,648 --> 01:26:28,648
再不回家 媽媽會開始擔心我在哪的
Mother will be wondering where I am if I'm not home soon.

855
01:26:37,588 --> 01:26:39,059
你害怕我嗎?
Are you frightened of me?

856
01:26:41,128 --> 01:26:42,128
不
No.

857
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:46,600
當然不是 珠兒
Of course not, Pearl.

858
01:26:50,168 --> 01:26:51,769
你認為我有病嗎?
Do you think I'm sick?

859
01:26:53,878 --> 01:26:54,878
不會
No.

860

什麼?
What?

863
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:09,790
能夠被選中
For getting the part

864
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:12,958
參加舞團 你實至名歸
in the dance troupe. You deserved it.

865
01:27:15,128 --> 01:27:17,898
- 我沒有被選中  - 沒關係的
-I didn't get the part. -It's okay.

866
01:27:19,068 --> 01:27:20,298
你不需要假裝了
You don't have to pretend anymore.

867
01:27:20,338 --> 01:27:21,910
不會傷到我的感情的
My feelings won't be hurt.

868
01:27:23,310 --> 01:27:25,540
如果不是我 我會高興是你的 對吧?
If it wasn't me, I'm glad it was you, right?

869
01:27:28,779 --> 01:27:30,849
- 但是 珠兒 我...  - 拜託了
-But, Pearl, I... -Please...

870
01:27:32,318 --> 01:27:33,719
別向我撒謊
Don't lie to me.

871
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:43,229
好吧 確實
Well, yes.

872

謝謝你
Thank you.

873
01:27:49,969 --> 01:27:51,870
這一定會非常棒
It's going to be real swell,

874
01:27:52,938 --> 01:27:54,938
能在全國到處跳舞
dancing around the state.

875
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:01,740
我希望你到時候能來看演出
I hope you can come see the show sometime.

876
01:28:05,378 --> 01:28:07,620
你總是能得到自己的想要的

你更年輕 也是金髮
You're younger and more blonde.

01:28:14,318 --> 01:28:16,958
我得走了
I have to go now.

01:28:20,930 --> 01:28:23,229
你不會對誰說什麼吧?
You're not gonna say anything, are you?

880
01:28:24,969 --> 01:28:26,140
不會
No.

881

沒人需要知道

885

01:30:32,430 --> 01:30:35,500
這不是我想要什麼的問題了 米斯蒂
It's not about what I want anymore, Mitsy.

901
01:30:35,529 --> 01:30:36,469
求求你

我也愛你

907

賜予我們這些
and these thy gifts

將要來到的 來自您的恩惠

借由我主基督
