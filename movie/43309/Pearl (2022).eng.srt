1
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,929
Eat up!

2
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:35,904
One day you'll never
see me again.

3
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:38,807
That's right, Charlie.

4
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:42,042
The farm life
may be it for you,

5
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:43,777
but it sure ain't
for me.

6
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,582
I'm special.

7
00:03:47,617 --> 00:03:51,287
Mama's gonna feel real stupid
when she finds out, won't she?

8
00:03:59,828 --> 00:04:03,167
One day, the whole world's
gonna know my name.

9
00:04:04,134 --> 00:04:07,003
You agree,
don't you, Mary?

10
00:04:08,272 --> 00:04:10,904
Oh. Why, thank you.

11
00:04:20,983 --> 00:04:23,686
I do love
a good audience.

12
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,359
Y'all see me
for who I really am.

13
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:39,436
A star.

14
00:04:48,778 --> 00:04:51,415
What are you doing in here,
Mr. Goose?

15
00:05:38,894 --> 00:05:40,364
Theda!

16
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,769
Go on, girl.

17
00:05:56,213 --> 00:05:57,946
Take it.

18
00:06:25,006 --> 00:06:28,377
You aren't to
indulge in any more
such foolishness.

19
00:06:28,411 --> 00:06:30,545
It's just dancing, Mama.

20
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:32,983
It's selfish
is what it is.

21
00:06:33,015 --> 00:06:34,549
With all the farmhands gone,

22
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,687
I can't do everything
around here myself.

23
00:06:40,557 --> 00:06:41,992
I help.

24
00:06:57,273 --> 00:06:59,407
Anything for me
in the post today?

25
00:06:59,441 --> 00:07:00,575
No.

26
00:07:06,316 --> 00:07:09,319
It says the Allies
have taken control of France.

27
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:11,252
You can read it
after supper.

28
00:07:11,286 --> 00:07:13,221
But, Mama,
this could mean
the end of the war!

29
00:07:13,256 --> 00:07:15,523
Do as I ask, Pearl.

30
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:18,593
I don't want to hear
about any more
dead Germans tonight.

31
00:07:29,204 --> 00:07:31,140
Supper's ready, Daddy.

32
00:07:37,647 --> 00:07:38,713
Bless us, O' Lord,

33
00:07:38,747 --> 00:07:41,118
and these thy gifts
which we are about

34
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:42,686
to receive
from thy bounty

35
00:07:42,717 --> 00:07:46,187
through Christ
our Lord. Amen.

36
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:47,324
Amen.

37
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,466
"My precious Pearl.

38
00:08:29,497 --> 00:08:33,302
"It feels as if
it has been
an eternity without you.

39
00:08:33,335 --> 00:08:35,372
"All we do is walk,
it seems.

40
00:08:35,405 --> 00:08:38,674
"I never know
if we'll get to where
they say we're going.

41
00:08:38,706 --> 00:08:41,242
"They have us chew
on bouillon cubes

42
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:43,244
"so we don't notice
the pains in our feet.

43
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,750
"I find it most frightening
at night in the trenches.

44
00:08:46,783 --> 00:08:48,018
"The mortar shells
are deafening.

45
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:51,486
"Many soldiers
have gone mad
with the fear.

46
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,622
"Carnage from the gas

47
00:08:52,656 --> 00:08:55,025
"has shown me things
I won't soon forget,

48
00:08:55,057 --> 00:08:57,226
"and thinking of you
has been my only reprieve.

49
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,263
"I will always be proud
to serve my country,

50
00:09:00,296 --> 00:09:02,466
"but one thing
this war has made clear

51
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:04,632
"is that I cannot wait
to return home

52
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:06,203
"and begin our life together.

53
00:09:06,236 --> 00:09:08,770
"I never want to be away
from you again.

54
00:09:08,804 --> 00:09:10,640
"Till death do us part.

55
00:09:10,674 --> 00:09:13,577
"Your loving husband,
Howard."

56
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:30,526
I'll go to town tomorrow.

57
00:09:32,796 --> 00:09:34,630
Pick up more medicine.

58
00:09:40,135 --> 00:09:42,505
Which means
I get to stop
by the pictures.

59
00:09:45,242 --> 00:09:47,442
Just don't tell Mama.

60
00:09:47,476 --> 00:09:50,645
They show
all the best dancers
at the pictures.

61
00:09:56,085 --> 00:09:58,455
I could be on the line
with those girls one day.

62
00:10:00,656 --> 00:10:02,025
I know I could.

63
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:16,606
Pearl.

64
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,544
I didn't want to waste
the hot water.

65
00:10:23,812 --> 00:10:26,616
The money for his medicine
is on the kitchen table.

66
00:10:31,453 --> 00:10:33,856
Remember
to cover your face.

67
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,257
And don't linger close
to anyone.

68
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:39,695
Papers are warning
of a lethal resurgence.

69
00:10:39,729 --> 00:10:42,765
God forbid sickness
returns to our home.

70
00:11:10,192 --> 00:11:11,861
The time is now...

71
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:20,403

Cigarette?

86
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:10,814
Oh, go on.
I don't have the bug.

87
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,655
You like the movies?

88
00:13:19,455 --> 00:13:20,822
I like dancing.

89
00:13:20,856 --> 00:13:23,026
Oh, a future Tiller Girl.

90
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:24,492
I can see it now.

91
00:13:24,526 --> 00:13:26,494
I wish.

92
00:13:26,528 --> 00:13:27,830
Why not?
You're pretty enough.

93
00:13:31,768 --> 00:13:33,971
On account of a husband,
I gather?

94
00:13:34,804 --> 00:13:35,973
He's overseas,

95
00:13:38,307 --> 00:13:40,945
but my father's infirmed,
so I have to help at home.

96
00:13:40,978 --> 00:13:42,411
I'm sorry to hear that.

97
00:13:43,513 --> 00:13:45,380
You want to come
watch the second show?

98
00:13:46,848 --> 00:13:47,984
Free admission.

99
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:52,388
I'm the projectionist.

100
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,893
I need to get going.

101
00:13:57,927 --> 00:14:01,497
Mama's expecting me,
but I appreciate the, um...

102
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:02,898
Stay there for just
one minute, would you?

103
00:14:05,067 --> 00:14:06,302
Okay.

104
00:14:25,622 --> 00:14:27,023
From what you just saw.

105
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:29,825
Aren't you showing it again?

106
00:14:29,859 --> 00:14:31,494
Ah... Sure,
but it's only one frame.

107
00:14:31,528 --> 00:14:33,562
Nobody will notice once
I splice it back together.

108
00:14:33,596 --> 00:14:34,697
You know,
caring for your family

109
00:14:34,731 --> 00:14:35,932
during these times
is admirable.

110
00:14:35,966 --> 00:14:37,734
You ought to
take pride in that,

111
00:14:37,765 --> 00:14:39,867
but don't forget to live
your life, too.

112
00:14:39,903 --> 00:14:40,971
I wouldn't mind seeing you

113
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,473
up on that screen
one day, missus...

114
00:14:44,406 --> 00:14:45,408
Pearl.

115
00:14:47,978 --> 00:14:49,979
Well, if you come back,

116
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:52,382
knock on this door.
I'm always here, and,

117
00:14:52,414 --> 00:14:54,484
well, I can run the pictures
as much as I like.

118
00:14:54,817 --> 00:14:55,986
Thank you.

119
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:57,919
I will.

120
00:17:25,866 --> 00:17:28,235
May I have this dance?

121
00:18:54,688 --> 00:18:56,224
I'm married!

122
00:19:09,806 --> 00:19:11,073
Shh...

123
00:20:23,078 --> 00:20:25,046
What took you so long?

124
00:20:25,082 --> 00:20:26,749
It's a far ride, Mama.

125
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,354
What is on your head?

126
00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:34,124
Found it along the road.

127
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,093
Do not bring it inside.

128
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,927
It may be covered
in germs.

129
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,034
Wash your hair.

130
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:45,936
If you're lucky,
it's only full of lice.

131
00:20:47,337 --> 00:20:49,703
When you finish,
your father needs changing.

132
00:20:50,739 --> 00:20:52,240
Don't let him
sit in his mess.

133
00:20:58,848 --> 00:21:01,151
I saw
a new picture today.

134
00:21:01,185 --> 00:21:04,354
You'd have liked it.
The girls were all flawless.

135
00:21:04,386 --> 00:21:06,421
There's no room
for even the tiniest

136
00:21:06,456 --> 00:21:09,493
lack of precision
in a troupe like that.

137
00:21:09,526 --> 00:21:11,927
It takes absolute perfection.

138
00:21:11,962 --> 00:21:15,031
What a charmed life
it must be
to star in the movies.

139
00:22:08,817 --> 00:22:10,818
Are you still in there?

140
00:22:45,055 --> 00:22:47,322
Bless us, O' Lord,
and these thy gifts

141
00:22:47,357 --> 00:22:50,427
which we are about to
receive from thy bounty

142
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:53,495
through Christ
our Lord. Amen.

143
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,796
Amen.

144
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,514
Where is
the rest of the money
I lent you?

145
00:23:12,547 --> 00:23:15,519
-There was none.
-I can count, Pearl.

146
00:23:16,552 --> 00:23:17,953
There are eight cents missing.

147
00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:22,223
I may have gotten some
hard candy for the trip home.

148
00:23:28,098 --> 00:23:28,999
That is enough, then.

149
00:23:29,031 --> 00:23:31,435
You ate the candy,
that was your supper.

150
00:23:31,468 --> 00:23:35,338
The food I worked hard
to prepare alone is not.

151
00:23:36,671 --> 00:23:39,576
But, Mama,
I rode all that way.
I'm starving.

152
00:23:39,609 --> 00:23:41,975
You may have
what's left of it
in the morning.

153
00:23:46,348 --> 00:23:48,552
-Where are you going?
-To bed!

154
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:51,088
I did not excuse you
from the table.

155
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,228
I know that.

156
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,094
And I am careful.

157
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:53,448
Good.

158
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,004
Please, Lord,

159
00:25:14,036 --> 00:25:17,473
make me the biggest star
the world has ever known

160
00:25:17,505 --> 00:25:21,343
so that I may get far,
far away from this place.

161
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,416
Amen.

162
00:26:37,187 --> 00:26:39,354
Afternoon, Pearl!

163
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:42,323
Hi, Mitsy!
I like your dress.

164
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:45,128
Oh, thank you.

165
00:26:45,161 --> 00:26:47,097
It feels wonderful
to finally be able to

166
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,063
don something pretty again.

167
00:26:49,098 --> 00:26:51,099
It's the first time
we've left home in weeks.

168
00:26:51,134 --> 00:26:53,334
Mother is so afraid
of getting ill.

169
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:54,636
Mama, too.

170
00:26:54,671 --> 00:26:56,104
Well,
we were a bit worried

171
00:26:56,139 --> 00:26:58,339
about the both of you
being out here all alone,

172
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:00,343
so we brought some food.

173
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:01,811
That's very kind.

174
00:27:01,843 --> 00:27:03,380
How have you
been getting on?

175
00:27:04,281 --> 00:27:06,316
Any new letters
from Howard?

176
00:27:06,348 --> 00:27:07,817
- Uh-uh.
- Oh, well...

177
00:27:07,849 --> 00:27:10,587
Mother has been
riddled with worry.

178
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:13,390
They say no news
is good news, though.

179
00:27:13,421 --> 00:27:15,125
If only his pride
hadn't gotten him

180
00:27:15,156 --> 00:27:17,260
involved in this dreadful war.

181
00:27:17,292 --> 00:27:18,395
You know we had a doctor

182
00:27:18,427 --> 00:27:20,395
willing to declare him
ineligible?

183
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,531
Anyone would've taken
that opportunity.

184
00:27:22,566 --> 00:27:23,432
Not Howard.

185
00:27:23,464 --> 00:27:26,234
First, he runs off
to become a farmer.

186
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,536
Now, the army.

187
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:31,608
The lengths
my brother will go to
just to spite his father.

188
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,442
All this isolation
has been enough

189
00:27:33,474 --> 00:27:35,209
to make one mad, hasn't it?

190
00:27:35,645 --> 00:27:37,681
It really has.

191
00:27:37,713 --> 00:27:40,114
No, we don't accept charity.

192
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,584
Oh, for God's sake, Ruth.
It's just a pig.

193
00:27:46,688 --> 00:27:48,592
Can I share
a secret with you, Pearl?

194
00:27:52,729 --> 00:27:54,395
Mother would throttle me

195
00:27:54,431 --> 00:27:56,666
if she knew I was
planning on attending.

196
00:27:56,698 --> 00:27:59,802
But there's a dance audition
this Saturday at our church

197
00:27:59,834 --> 00:28:01,636
for a Christmas chorus line

198
00:28:01,671 --> 00:28:02,572
to bring merriment to folks

199
00:28:02,604 --> 00:28:04,807
throughout the state
during the holidays.

200
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:07,744
Word is, they're putting
together a troupe

201
00:28:07,776 --> 00:28:09,911
and will be touring
seven different cities

202
00:28:09,947 --> 00:28:11,281
before the year ends.

203
00:28:11,312 --> 00:28:13,182
Don't that sound exciting?

204
00:28:13,214 --> 00:28:15,484
I would love so much
to be a part of it.

205
00:28:15,516 --> 00:28:16,753
So would I.

206
00:28:16,786 --> 00:28:18,755
We should
go together then.

207
00:28:18,786 --> 00:28:21,557
But you can't tell a soul.

208
00:28:21,589 --> 00:28:22,859
I would never.

209
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:25,328
Splendid.
It'll be our secret.

210
00:28:25,362 --> 00:28:26,761
Mitsy!

211
00:28:27,495 --> 00:28:28,563
I better skedaddle.

212
00:28:28,598 --> 00:28:31,766
We got three more pigs
to drop off this afternoon.

213
00:28:33,302 --> 00:28:35,338
Saturday at 11:00.

214
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,771
Okay.

215
00:28:36,806 --> 00:28:38,775
Sister-in-laws have to
stick together, right?

216
00:28:38,807 --> 00:28:40,810
Mitsy!

217
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:43,344
-Time to go!
-See you later, Pearl.

218
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,583
Bye, Mitsy!

219
00:28:51,687 --> 00:28:54,322
Charlie, this could be it.

220
00:30:08,964 --> 00:30:10,333
Pearl?

221
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,411
Pearl!

222
00:32:01,109 --> 00:32:02,443
Well,

223
00:32:02,478 --> 00:32:04,614
I didn't expect to see you
again this soon.

224
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,666
Have a seat.

225
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:37,745
I can't believe
you get to see

226
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,848
the pictures every day
for free.

227
00:32:39,883 --> 00:32:41,618
Yeah, not a bad gig, huh?

228
00:32:46,656 --> 00:32:48,691
Thank you.

229
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,129
So, to what do I owe
this pleasure?

230
00:32:54,197 --> 00:32:55,697
I've been thinking
a lot about

231
00:32:55,732 --> 00:32:57,134
what you said to me
the other day

232
00:32:57,166 --> 00:32:59,167
about not forgetting
to live my life,

233
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:01,437
and, well,

234
00:33:01,469 --> 00:33:04,208
there's a dance audition
coming up at the church.

235
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:05,842
Oh, I like
the sound of that.

236
00:33:06,641 --> 00:33:08,878
So do I...

237
00:33:08,911 --> 00:33:11,748
But I've never really danced
in front of anyone before.

238
00:33:13,515 --> 00:33:15,651
What if I'm not perfect?

239
00:33:15,685 --> 00:33:17,786
You can do anything
if you want it bad enough.

240
00:33:19,255 --> 00:33:21,624
I want it.

241
00:33:21,656 --> 00:33:23,724
Then don't let anything
stand in your way.

242
00:33:25,862 --> 00:33:27,630
What would you like to see?

243
00:33:28,232 --> 00:33:29,666
Palace Follies.

244
00:33:29,697 --> 00:33:32,535
Oh, come on.
You saw that already.

245
00:33:32,567 --> 00:33:33,834
How about something
different tonight?

246
00:33:33,869 --> 00:33:35,104
How about...

247
00:33:38,807 --> 00:33:41,878
How about a film
nobody else has seen?

248
00:33:42,177 --> 00:33:43,180
Okay.

249
00:33:44,913 --> 00:33:45,948
I picked this one up while

250
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:47,715
I was in the service
in France.

251
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:54,958
Do you live in here?

252
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,931
I lay my head on that pillow
from time to time,

253
00:34:00,963 --> 00:34:03,800
but I wouldn't say I live
anywhere in particular.

254
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:07,536
I'm what more civilized people
refer to as bohemian.

255
00:34:08,971 --> 00:34:10,072
I don't know what that is.

256
00:34:10,105 --> 00:34:13,643
It means I can pack up
and leave whenever I want to.

257
00:34:14,311 --> 00:34:16,510
Sounds like a dream.

258
00:34:16,544 --> 00:34:19,049
Just as long as I can
keep from waking up.

259
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:46,642
What is this?

260
00:34:46,676 --> 00:34:48,010
Just watch.

261
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:23,011
Never seen anything
like that before
now, have you?

262
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,916
There are all kinds of
underground stag films

263
00:35:26,948 --> 00:35:28,152
like this out there.

264
00:35:29,917 --> 00:35:31,187
Is it legal?

265
00:35:31,219 --> 00:35:33,957
Doing it, yeah.

266
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:36,657
Filming it, no.

267
00:35:37,825 --> 00:35:40,895
Not here, anyway.
It will be eventually.

268
00:35:40,929 --> 00:35:44,600
People would pay an arm
and a leg to see this.

269
00:35:44,634 --> 00:35:47,037
Pictures like this are going
to revolutionize the industry

270
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:50,339
and I, for one, plan on
capitalizing early.

271
00:35:51,641 --> 00:35:53,774
It's reality.

272
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:56,812
There's no denying
we all share a fascination

273
00:35:56,844 --> 00:35:59,749
in seeing people
as they truly are.

274
00:36:00,716 --> 00:36:02,583
I don't like reality.

275
00:36:06,322 --> 00:36:07,855
Where I live,
I mean.

276
00:36:08,758 --> 00:36:09,927
So leave.

277
00:36:17,898 --> 00:36:19,700
It's not that easy.

278
00:36:19,735 --> 00:36:20,835
Well, sure it is.

279
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:21,871
There's a road
right out front there

280
00:36:21,904 --> 00:36:23,840
that'll take you
all the way
to New York City.

281
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,010
One day my mother and father
will be gone.

282
00:36:29,779 --> 00:36:31,747
I can do what I want then.

283
00:36:31,781 --> 00:36:33,148
What if that's too late?

284
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:36,686
The fact and truth
of the matter is, Pearl,

285
00:36:37,718 --> 00:36:40,055
you only get
one take at this life.

286
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,426
And if you don't
make the most of it
when you're young,

287
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:44,292
you don't get
a second chance.

288
00:36:47,364 --> 00:36:49,697
If only they would just die.

289
00:36:54,002 --> 00:36:55,003
Pardon?

290
00:36:58,406 --> 00:36:59,642
Nothing.

291
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:07,416
It's real nice to be able to
talk to someone for a change.

292
00:37:07,449 --> 00:37:09,951
Been cooped up
on that farm for so long

293
00:37:09,987 --> 00:37:12,020
sometimes I worry
that maybe

294
00:37:12,053 --> 00:37:14,688
I'm not the same
as other people.

295
00:37:15,856 --> 00:37:18,826
Why would you ever
want to be
like everybody else?

296
00:37:20,497 --> 00:37:21,830
I don't know.

297
00:37:24,032 --> 00:37:27,270
Sometimes it just seems
more peaceful, I guess.

298
00:37:38,248 --> 00:37:40,315
Did you mean
what you said?

299
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,750
About wanting to see me
up on that screen?

300
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:45,422
Sure, I did.

301
00:37:46,388 --> 00:37:48,356
I'd do anything
to be up there.

302
00:37:50,158 --> 00:37:51,495
Well, then,
you ought to go overseas

303
00:37:51,528 --> 00:37:53,229
when this pandemic ends.

304
00:37:53,261 --> 00:37:54,864
That's what I'm doing.

305
00:37:54,895 --> 00:37:57,232
The arts are so much more
alive in Europe.

306
00:37:57,267 --> 00:37:59,201
You can be whoever
you want to be there.

307
00:38:00,335 --> 00:38:01,802
Really?

308
00:38:01,835 --> 00:38:03,406
You could even be
in pictures like this.

309
00:38:04,805 --> 00:38:06,041
I know I'd watch you.

310
00:38:12,516 --> 00:38:14,017
I should go now.

311
00:38:17,885 --> 00:38:18,886
Thank you.

312
00:38:19,887 --> 00:38:21,391
What for?

313
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:22,958
For seeing me tonight.

314
00:39:48,543 --> 00:39:50,010
What are you
staring at?

315
00:40:32,589 --> 00:40:34,291
Theda!

316
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:45,899
I'm leaving soon.

317
00:40:51,174 --> 00:40:53,509
I can't stay here
any longer.

318
00:40:55,312 --> 00:40:57,381
Howard was supposed
to take me away.

319
00:41:00,148 --> 00:41:01,384
It'd be easier for me

320
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:03,917
if I didn't feel like
I was abandoning you.

321
00:41:06,156 --> 00:41:07,224
You understand that?

322
00:41:13,363 --> 00:41:16,264
I love you, Daddy,
but this is
no way to live.

323
00:41:20,335 --> 00:41:21,604
Pearl?

324
00:41:23,572 --> 00:41:25,041
What are you doing?

325
00:41:26,643 --> 00:41:28,445
Talking with Daddy.

326
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:34,017
We need to get him
back to the house.

327
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,553
Why do you hate me, Mama?

328
00:41:42,426 --> 00:41:44,394
I only want what's best.

329
00:41:47,262 --> 00:41:48,965
When do I get what I want?

330
00:41:52,367 --> 00:41:53,437
One day you'll understand

331
00:41:53,468 --> 00:41:56,471
that getting what you want
isn't what's important.

332
00:41:59,009 --> 00:42:01,042
Making the most
of what you have is.

333
00:42:02,279 --> 00:42:05,313
Life rarely turns out
how you expect.

334
00:42:05,346 --> 00:42:06,648
You need to be
prepared for that

335
00:42:06,683 --> 00:42:08,416
if you ever want
to be happy.

336
00:42:10,287 --> 00:42:11,520
Come back inside.

337
00:42:29,372 --> 00:42:31,072
Where are you?

338
00:43:45,215 --> 00:43:47,782
Stop staring at me.

339
00:44:49,377 --> 00:44:51,346
How'd you find that?

340
00:44:51,381 --> 00:44:54,517
I am not blind to
what goes on around here.

341
00:44:54,551 --> 00:44:56,884
Take your dinner.
Stay in the bunkhouse.

342
00:44:56,918 --> 00:44:58,553
But it's freezing
out there!

343
00:44:58,586 --> 00:45:01,356
You should've thought of that
before putting me at risk.

344
00:45:01,391 --> 00:45:04,394
Isolate yourself
until we know
you're not ill.

345
00:45:04,427 --> 00:45:05,695
That is what's right.

346
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:12,435
There's a dance audition
in town tomorrow.

347
00:45:15,604 --> 00:45:17,340
I'm going to it.

348
00:45:17,374 --> 00:45:18,875
No, you're not.

349
00:45:18,906 --> 00:45:21,645
-Yes, I am.
-Why?

350
00:45:22,812 --> 00:45:24,714
Find out
if I'm good enough.

351
00:45:25,715 --> 00:45:27,416
Good enough
for what, Pearl?

352
00:45:32,455 --> 00:45:34,555
Something more than this.

353
00:45:38,228 --> 00:45:41,297
Where does all this
ungratefulness stem from?

354
00:45:41,331 --> 00:45:44,467
How is it you find our life
so beneath you?

355
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,468
You've always had
a roof over your head,

356
00:45:46,501 --> 00:45:48,604
food in your belly.

357
00:45:48,636 --> 00:45:50,772
Do you not think that came
at great sacrifice

358
00:45:50,805 --> 00:45:52,740
from your father and I?

359
00:45:52,774 --> 00:45:55,877
Or do you think we are
beneath you, too?

360
00:45:55,912 --> 00:45:57,714
If I'm meant to live out
the rest of my days

361
00:45:57,747 --> 00:45:59,514
with you and Daddy
on this farm,

362
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:00,648
then so be it.

363
00:46:00,684 --> 00:46:03,353
But I'm only young once.

364
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:06,256
If I go to this audition
and I don't get picked,

365
00:46:06,289 --> 00:46:07,489
then I'll come home

366
00:46:07,522 --> 00:46:10,760
and I'll never speak
of it again, I swear.

367
00:46:10,792 --> 00:46:12,495
But I have to know
that I tried

368
00:46:12,529 --> 00:46:14,364
or I'm gonna regret it
for the rest of my life.

369
00:46:14,395 --> 00:46:17,231
Please, Mama.
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

370
00:46:19,001 --> 00:46:20,468
Oh, yes, I do.

371
00:46:21,905 --> 00:46:24,906
I've seen the things
you've done in private,

372
00:46:25,976 --> 00:46:27,644
when you believe
no one is watching.

373
00:46:29,044 --> 00:46:31,947
You think others
won't notice?

374
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:35,718
You can't keep
your true self
hidden forever, Pearl.

375
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:38,753
They will notice eventually,
and they will be frightened,

376
00:46:39,789 --> 00:46:41,224
just as I am.

377
00:46:42,726 --> 00:46:45,862
-You're wrong.
-Am I?

378
00:46:45,895 --> 00:46:49,864
Then what a fine woman
you hope to become,

379
00:46:49,897 --> 00:46:51,568
leaving your mother alone
to rot

380
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:54,635
so you can dance with
a bunch of city whores.

381
00:46:54,669 --> 00:46:57,507
Let alone the illness you may
contract and spread.

382
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,440
You've seen what it does
to your father.

383
00:46:59,476 --> 00:47:01,478
That's what you want
for yourself and others?

384
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:04,012
And maybe that is what
you wish for me.

385
00:47:04,048 --> 00:47:06,683
-Of course not.
-Stop lying!

386
00:47:06,716 --> 00:47:08,783
I can't stand
the sound of it anymore!

387
00:47:08,818 --> 00:47:12,422
It's almost as abhorrent
as your sinful behavior!

388
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:15,656
You are not well, Pearl!

389
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:18,326
It's only a matter of time
before you hurt
someone else.

390
00:47:18,361 --> 00:47:22,632
Malevolence is festering
in you, I see it.

391
00:47:22,665 --> 00:47:24,801
And I will not,
in good conscious,

392
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:26,701
let you leave
this farm again.

393
00:47:27,871 --> 00:47:29,637
You can't stop me.

394
00:47:29,672 --> 00:47:31,341
Oh, yes, I can.

395
00:47:31,374 --> 00:47:34,042
You don't want to know
what I could do to you.

396
00:47:34,076 --> 00:47:38,082
I shoulder a burden
you will never understand,

397
00:47:38,114 --> 00:47:40,050
spend my days feeding
and wiping the snot

398
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:42,352
off the face of the man
I married.

399
00:47:42,385 --> 00:47:45,687
You dare sit there
and talk to me
about regret?

400
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,791
I was supposed
to be his wife,
not his mother!

401
00:47:48,823 --> 00:47:51,528
Don't you ever speak
that way to me again!

402
00:47:51,561 --> 00:47:52,895
Do you hear me?

403
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,864
-I'm sorry.
-No! You're not!

404
00:47:55,897 --> 00:47:57,732
Or you would stop
all this!

405
00:47:57,767 --> 00:47:59,367
Here! Take it!

406
00:47:59,402 --> 00:48:02,470
That's what
you really desire,
isn't it?

407
00:48:02,503 --> 00:48:05,040
Perhaps I should
kill him for you?

408
00:48:05,073 --> 00:48:07,542
That way you don't have to
care for him any longer.

409
00:48:07,575 --> 00:48:10,547
Would that suit
your selfish dreams better?

410
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:12,715
Then we can both
go to the dance audition!

411
00:48:12,749 --> 00:48:15,117
Your husband is gone.
So is mine.

412
00:48:15,152 --> 00:48:16,918
Why should we be saddled
with caring for them

413
00:48:16,954 --> 00:48:18,553
or the work of this farm?

414
00:48:18,586 --> 00:48:21,457
What about us
getting what we want?

415
00:48:29,499 --> 00:48:31,666
I won't suffer for you
any longer.

416
00:48:31,699 --> 00:48:34,904
You want to leave? Go.

417
00:48:34,937 --> 00:48:36,506
But when you fail...

418
00:48:37,906 --> 00:48:39,642
And you will fail...

419
00:48:40,978 --> 00:48:43,047
I want you to remember
what it feels like

420
00:48:44,512 --> 00:48:49,384
because that's how I feel
every time I look at you.

421
00:48:49,417 --> 00:48:53,489
Nearly everything
I ever had has been
taken from me, Pearl.

422
00:48:55,725 --> 00:48:58,126
What more do you want?

423
00:48:58,162 --> 00:49:01,165
I just don't want to end up
like you, is all.

424
00:49:13,476 --> 00:49:15,778
I hate you!

425
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:19,549
You harlot!

426
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:21,884
I won't let you flaunt
your arrogance in my face!

427
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:24,989
-You are not better than me!
-Yes, I am!

428
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,156
I'm going to be a star!

429
00:49:27,189 --> 00:49:29,927
The whole world
is going to know my name!

430
00:52:07,017 --> 00:52:09,617
Where are you going?
It's not even
6:00 a.m. yet.

431
00:52:09,652 --> 00:52:11,253
I have to
practice my routine.

432
00:52:11,288 --> 00:52:13,888
I need to be perfect
for my audition today.

433
00:52:16,857 --> 00:52:18,996
You still think
I'm pretty enough?

434
00:52:19,029 --> 00:52:21,331
Oh, not much has changed
in the last 24 hours.

435
00:52:21,364 --> 00:52:22,933
Yes, it has.

436
00:52:22,966 --> 00:52:25,801
Oh. You forgot this
last time.

437
00:52:27,404 --> 00:52:29,104
I'm glad you came back.

438
00:52:32,009 --> 00:52:33,944
So am I.

439
00:52:39,349 --> 00:52:41,083
Let me at least
drive you home.

440
00:52:54,262 --> 00:52:55,864
Somebody you know?

441
00:52:59,034 --> 00:53:00,770
I'm not really sure.

442
00:53:01,437 --> 00:53:03,804
Well...

443
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,342
It's hard to know
who anyone is nowadays

444
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:07,242
with all these masks
people are wearing.

445
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,274
Wait here a minute.

446
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:04,366
Daddy,
I'm so sorry.

447
00:54:25,821 --> 00:54:27,790
I'm going to get you
cleaned up real soon, okay?

448
00:54:27,822 --> 00:54:29,059
I just have
a guest right now.

449
00:54:29,092 --> 00:54:30,959
Shh!

450
00:54:43,104 --> 00:54:45,208
Ah. Ah.

451
00:54:59,854 --> 00:55:00,854
Okay, come in!

452
00:55:19,241 --> 00:55:20,375
This is my father.

453
00:55:24,479 --> 00:55:26,016
Pleased to meet you, sir.

454
00:55:34,258 --> 00:55:36,024
Want to go up
to my bedroom now?

455
00:55:42,832 --> 00:55:44,898
I want off this farm forever.

456
00:55:46,403 --> 00:55:48,503
I don't know.
It doesn't seem so bad.

457
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,475
It is.

458
00:55:52,574 --> 00:55:55,543
What was that?

459
00:55:55,579 --> 00:55:58,048
Nothing.

460
00:55:58,081 --> 00:56:00,448
Tell me more about Europe.

461
00:56:01,318 --> 00:56:02,552
When can we go?

462
00:56:04,419 --> 00:56:06,423
Don't you think
you should go check?

463
00:56:07,424 --> 00:56:08,523
No.

464
00:56:11,028 --> 00:56:12,395
All right.
I'm sorry.

465
00:56:13,062 --> 00:56:14,095
Whatever that is,

466
00:56:14,131 --> 00:56:15,830
we can't just ignore it.

467
00:56:15,864 --> 00:56:17,333
It could be your father,
for Christ's sake.

468
00:56:17,365 --> 00:56:19,200
It's not my father.

469
00:56:19,236 --> 00:56:22,104
Please don't go.

470
00:56:23,638 --> 00:56:24,874
What's the matter with you?

471
00:56:26,375 --> 00:56:27,944
Nothing.

472
00:57:18,562 --> 00:57:20,497
It's our dog.

473
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:22,332
She made a mess
in the kitchen
while I was away,

474
00:57:22,364 --> 00:57:23,666
so I put her
in the root cellar.

475
00:57:26,534 --> 00:57:28,038
I want to
show you something.

476
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:36,446
That's Charlie!

477
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,549
She's always hungry.

478
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:42,083
We can't afford to feed her
like we used to.

479
00:57:42,117 --> 00:57:45,154
And over here,
this is Mary.

480
00:57:45,187 --> 00:57:46,455
Ain't she a dish?

481
00:57:46,989 --> 00:57:48,258
Mmm.

482
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:50,658
This is Francis.

483
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,663
They're my best audience.

484
00:57:53,697 --> 00:57:57,565
I named each of them after
my favorite picture stars.

485
00:57:57,601 --> 00:58:01,169
I've put on so many shows
for them over the years.

486
00:58:01,204 --> 00:58:03,239
It'll be sad to say goodbye,
but like they say,

487
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,606
"If you're not moving forward
in show business,

488
00:58:04,641 --> 00:58:05,906
"you're moving backwards."

489
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:09,010
We used to have
many more animals,

490
00:58:10,044 --> 00:58:11,248
but they all died.

491
00:58:12,416 --> 00:58:13,948
What about your dog?

492
00:58:13,982 --> 00:58:15,583
Huh?

493
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:18,219
-What's its name?
-We don't have a dog.

494
00:58:19,989 --> 00:58:22,323
I thought you said
you, uh, did?

495
00:58:22,357 --> 00:58:23,927
In the cellar?

496
00:58:25,162 --> 00:58:26,163
Oh.

497
00:58:27,262 --> 00:58:31,268
Right. Yeah.

498
00:58:31,301 --> 00:58:35,336
Yeah, well, um...

499
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,975
Oh, boy.

500
00:58:39,009 --> 00:58:41,177
Oh, I better be getting back,
you know?

501
00:58:43,711 --> 00:58:45,346
-What?
-Oh, I've got to go

502
00:58:45,382 --> 00:58:46,516
and screen the matinee,
you know,

503
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:48,149
but you gotta practice,
remember?

504
00:58:48,185 --> 00:58:49,686
You gotta get those
dance moves perfect.

505
00:58:50,654 --> 00:58:51,687
Now's not the time to be

506
00:58:51,719 --> 00:58:53,423
resting on your laurels,
is it?

507
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:57,325
Nice seeing you,
Pearl.

508
00:59:00,697 --> 00:59:03,133
Did I do something wrong?

509
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:06,167
No.

510
00:59:07,737 --> 00:59:10,207
Then why did you
just go cold on me?

511
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,144
I don't know what you mean.

512
00:59:14,644 --> 00:59:16,312
What did you see?

513
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,082
I didn't see anything.

514
00:59:21,282 --> 00:59:23,284
You're lying.

515
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,455
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

516
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:30,093
I know because
I feel things
very deeply.

517
00:59:31,561 --> 00:59:33,229
Look, I've got to get back
to work, all right?

518
00:59:33,261 --> 00:59:34,664
-I'll... I'll see you later.
-When?

519
00:59:34,697 --> 00:59:37,133
-What?
-When will I see you?

520
00:59:37,166 --> 00:59:38,199
I don't know, Pearl.
It's just an expression.

521
00:59:38,235 --> 00:59:39,569
You're not going to
take me to Europe,
are you?

522
00:59:39,603 --> 00:59:40,604
Tell me the truth.

523
00:59:43,239 --> 00:59:44,572
What did I do wrong?

524
00:59:44,606 --> 00:59:45,773
- Nothing. Calm down.
- No!

525
00:59:45,809 --> 00:59:48,543
Why are you leaving me
if I didn't do
anything wrong?

526
00:59:48,576 --> 00:59:50,614
I don't understand!
I thought you liked me!

527
00:59:50,645 --> 00:59:53,750
-I do like you. I just...
-Tell me the truth!

528
00:59:53,781 --> 00:59:55,318
Why are you leaving me?
What did you see?

529
00:59:55,352 --> 00:59:56,416
Why did you change?

530
00:59:56,451 --> 00:59:58,288
You're scaring me, Pearl.

531
00:59:59,354 --> 01:00:00,590
Okay?

532
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:05,293
I wish you the best of luck
with your audition.

533
01:00:05,326 --> 01:00:06,530
Sincerely.

534
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:31,488
You're not
gonna leave me here!

535
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,424
I'm not staying
on this farm!

536
01:00:37,292 --> 01:00:40,196
Nothing's going to
keep me here!

537
01:00:48,405 --> 01:00:51,239
You hear me?

538
01:00:52,142 --> 01:00:54,343
Nothing!

539
01:00:57,547 --> 01:00:59,883
Not you! Not Howard!

540
01:00:59,916 --> 01:01:02,718
Not Mama! Nobody!

541
01:01:11,327 --> 01:01:12,862
No. No.

542
01:01:32,382 --> 01:01:34,649
I want you to remember
what it feels like.

543
01:01:37,487 --> 01:01:40,355
'Cause that's how I felt
every time you looked at me.

544
01:01:46,663 --> 01:01:48,763
Okay, Daddy.

545
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:50,433
Let's get you cleaned up.

546
01:02:20,998 --> 01:02:23,731
I wish you wouldn't
look at me like that.

547
01:02:57,666 --> 01:02:58,833
What do you think?

548
01:03:29,064 --> 01:03:31,399
Thank you for everything.

549
01:03:32,867 --> 01:03:35,739
I know you'll look down
on me proudly.

550
01:03:43,312 --> 01:03:44,845
You are loved.

551
01:04:05,802 --> 01:04:08,738
Au revoir, poor Johnny!

552
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:52,749
Oh, thank goodness
you came.

553
01:04:52,781 --> 01:04:54,683
I was beginning to think
you weren't going to show.

554
01:04:54,717 --> 01:04:56,417
Sorry.

555
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:58,621
I had some chores to do
around the house.

556
01:04:58,655 --> 01:05:01,355
Well, I've been
in such a flap
all by myself.

557
01:05:01,391 --> 01:05:02,892
I feel worse
than I imagine I would

558
01:05:02,927 --> 01:05:05,029
had I contracted
that awful flu.

559
01:05:06,729 --> 01:05:08,596
What's in
the suitcases?

560
01:05:08,631 --> 01:05:10,833
All my things I need
for going on the road.

561
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:13,070
Wow.
You're confident.

562
01:05:15,003 --> 01:05:18,573
Rumor has it they may only be
taking one gal per town.

563
01:05:20,608 --> 01:05:21,876
It has to be me.

564
01:05:25,415 --> 01:05:28,616
I don't think you meant
to say that out loud, Pearl.

565
01:05:28,649 --> 01:05:31,654
Well, if it's not me,
then I hope it's you,
right?

566
01:05:32,187 --> 01:05:33,688
It has to be me.

567
01:05:38,895 --> 01:05:40,128
Next.

568
01:05:52,809 --> 01:05:54,444
That's Dorothy Collins.

569
01:05:57,645 --> 01:05:59,883
Can't say I'm too
saddened for her.

570
01:05:59,916 --> 01:06:03,486
Some people just think
they're God's gift,
you know?

571
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:06,123
But they always get what's
coming to them eventually.

572
01:06:09,893 --> 01:06:11,694
I feel bad saying that,
actually.

573
01:06:11,728 --> 01:06:13,794
She's a nurse.

574
01:06:13,830 --> 01:06:16,165
I don't know how to do
something like that.

575
01:06:16,198 --> 01:06:18,601
Oh, Pearl.
I'm so nervous.

576
01:06:18,635 --> 01:06:20,501
What if they laugh me
right off stage?

577
01:06:20,535 --> 01:06:22,137
I don't think
I could handle that.

578
01:06:24,707 --> 01:06:26,176
How are you not scared?

579
01:06:28,645 --> 01:06:31,081
I guess I'm just
more used
to the feeling.

580
01:06:36,751 --> 01:06:37,919
Next.

581
01:06:54,038 --> 01:06:55,571
Oh, Lord.

582
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:06,516
Switch places with me.

583
01:07:06,549 --> 01:07:08,649
I don't think I can do this.
I'm too frightened.

584
01:07:08,685 --> 01:07:10,584
-What?
-Come on, Pearl.

585
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:13,089
Switch before they open
the doors again.

586
01:07:14,058 --> 01:07:16,490
Come on. Move.

587
01:07:21,096 --> 01:07:22,933
Thank you.

588
01:07:23,864 --> 01:07:25,468
You're a good friend.

589
01:07:30,604 --> 01:07:31,772
Am I?

590
01:07:34,144 --> 01:07:35,510
Of course you are.

591
01:07:41,884 --> 01:07:44,121
Sister-in-laws have to
stick together, right?

592
01:08:12,614 --> 01:08:13,781
Next.

593
01:08:14,684 --> 01:08:16,550
Your turn, Pearl.

594
01:08:16,584 --> 01:08:18,988
Time to show them
what you can do.

595
01:08:19,021 --> 01:08:20,655
I'm gonna show them all.

596
01:08:21,356 --> 01:08:22,825
Break a leg.

597
01:09:26,021 --> 01:09:27,355
Ready, miss?

598
01:11:25,541 --> 01:11:27,042
Thank you.

599
01:11:28,979 --> 01:11:30,378
But it's gonna be a no.

600
01:11:46,062 --> 01:11:48,332
Pardon?

601
01:11:48,365 --> 01:11:51,299
Sorry, you're just not
what we had in mind.

602
01:12:00,477 --> 01:12:02,944
Well, that was the best
dancing I've ever done.

603
01:12:04,348 --> 01:12:07,416
Yes, it was very nice.

604
01:12:07,451 --> 01:12:11,121
But we already have
plenty of gals like you
in the troupe.

605
01:12:11,152 --> 01:12:14,089
We're looking for
something different today.

606
01:12:14,124 --> 01:12:18,562
You know?
More all-American,

607
01:12:18,594 --> 01:12:20,295
younger and blonde.

608
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:23,833
Someone with X factor.

609
01:12:27,371 --> 01:12:28,472
What?

610
01:12:31,208 --> 01:12:32,340
Next!

611
01:12:38,313 --> 01:12:39,849
Come on.

612
01:12:40,482 --> 01:12:41,851
-Come on.
-No.

613
01:12:42,916 --> 01:12:45,587
I'm afraid so.

614
01:12:45,622 --> 01:12:48,125
Come on, miss.
Time to go.

615
01:12:53,128 --> 01:12:55,265
Please.

616
01:12:55,297 --> 01:12:57,399
You don't understand.
I need this.

617
01:12:57,434 --> 01:13:00,870
Next in line, please.

618
01:13:00,901 --> 01:13:02,372
I can make it better.

619
01:13:02,405 --> 01:13:03,505
Come on now, darling.

620
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:06,441
You don't want to make a scene
and spoil everything.

621
01:13:06,476 --> 01:13:09,444
Please! Just give me
one more chance.

622
01:13:10,913 --> 01:13:12,416
-Come on, now.
-No.

623
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:14,916
I'm a... I'm a star.

624
01:13:16,151 --> 01:13:18,988
Come on.
Come on, miss.
I'm sorry.

625
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:21,256
-It's time to go.
-No, I'm a star!

626
01:13:21,291 --> 01:13:22,357
Come on.

627
01:13:24,192 --> 01:13:28,863
Please! I'm a star!

628
01:13:28,896 --> 01:13:30,534
I'm sorry. It's time to go.

629
01:13:30,565 --> 01:13:32,967
Please,
somebody help me!

630
01:13:33,001 --> 01:13:36,504
Please! Help me!
Help me!

631
01:13:38,106 --> 01:13:39,840
No!

632
01:14:17,613 --> 01:14:18,914
Pearl?

633
01:14:21,351 --> 01:14:22,484
Pearl?

634
01:14:27,255 --> 01:14:29,023
How about
I take you home?

635
01:14:58,654 --> 01:15:00,290
Is that our pig?

636
01:15:19,007 --> 01:15:20,508
Should I go
and fetch your mother?

637
01:15:22,043 --> 01:15:23,479
No.

638
01:15:29,717 --> 01:15:32,289
How about I get you
something nice to drink?

639
01:15:35,256 --> 01:15:36,625
Mama was right.

640
01:15:38,762 --> 01:15:40,996
I'm never getting off
this farm.

641
01:15:42,130 --> 01:15:43,500
And where would you
want to go?

642
01:15:44,799 --> 01:15:46,634
-Europe.
-Europe?

643
01:15:46,668 --> 01:15:49,139
What on earth for?

644
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:50,307
It'll be in ruins

645
01:15:50,338 --> 01:15:52,642
and you'll never get Howard
back there, I'll tell you.

646
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:56,580
Oh, come on, now.

647
01:15:56,611 --> 01:15:57,581
I know you're disappointed,

648
01:15:57,613 --> 01:16:00,250
but there's no sense
in taking it this hard.

649
01:16:00,283 --> 01:16:02,550
It's just a lousy
old church group.

650
01:16:02,584 --> 01:16:05,086
Those old dolts,

651
01:16:05,121 --> 01:16:09,226
they don't know the first
thing about quality dancing.

652
01:16:10,291 --> 01:16:12,329
You don't understand.

653
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:13,729
What don't I?

654
01:16:14,395 --> 01:16:15,532
Come on, Pearl.

655
01:16:16,397 --> 01:16:17,565
What's really the matter?

656
01:16:20,804 --> 01:16:22,539
I don't feel

657
01:16:23,838 --> 01:16:25,208
well.

658
01:16:28,078 --> 01:16:29,777
You're not coming down
with something,
are you?

659
01:16:29,812 --> 01:16:31,348
No.

660
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:32,616
It's nothing like that.

661
01:16:32,647 --> 01:16:34,215
Oh, thank goodness.

662
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:35,550
If I snuck out of the house

663
01:16:35,583 --> 01:16:38,455
and ended up bringing home
nothing but the germ,

664
01:16:38,486 --> 01:16:41,256
my mother and father
would just kill me.

665
01:16:43,358 --> 01:16:45,228
I'm worried there
may be something

666
01:16:45,262 --> 01:16:47,196
real wrong with me, Mitsy.

667
01:16:49,397 --> 01:16:50,433
How do you mean?

668
01:16:51,633 --> 01:16:54,137
Seems like there's
something missing in me

669
01:16:54,168 --> 01:16:56,206
that the rest
of the world has.

670
01:16:57,741 --> 01:16:59,242
Have you told Howard?

671
01:17:01,109 --> 01:17:04,848
I've never spoken about it
out loud to anyone.

672
01:17:04,879 --> 01:17:07,784
So afraid of
what people might think.

673
01:17:07,815 --> 01:17:09,184
Pearl...

674
01:17:10,653 --> 01:17:12,556
Howard's your husband.

675
01:17:13,823 --> 01:17:15,590
He adores you.

676
01:17:15,625 --> 01:17:18,293
You shouldn't be afraid
to tell him how you feel.

677
01:17:19,562 --> 01:17:22,130
I'm scared of
what I might say.

678
01:17:22,165 --> 01:17:24,534
Well, practice
on me first, then.

679
01:17:25,233 --> 01:17:26,703
Pretend I'm Howard,

680
01:17:26,734 --> 01:17:29,539
and you just say
whatever's on your mind.

681
01:17:29,573 --> 01:17:31,474
-I can't.
-Yes, you can.

682
01:17:32,541 --> 01:17:33,608
Go on. Get it all out.

683
01:17:35,443 --> 01:17:37,681
-Really?
-Yes.

684
01:17:38,379 --> 01:17:39,416
Trust me.

685
01:17:52,162 --> 01:17:53,195
Howard...

686
01:17:59,734 --> 01:18:00,870
Go ahead, Pearl.

687
01:18:07,709 --> 01:18:10,347
I hate you so much
for leaving me here,

688
01:18:10,378 --> 01:18:12,313
sometimes I hope you die.

689
01:18:15,518 --> 01:18:17,854
I'm sorry.

690
01:18:17,886 --> 01:18:20,855
I feel awful admitting that,
but it's the truth.

691
01:18:23,858 --> 01:18:25,228
I was curious

692
01:18:26,528 --> 01:18:27,729
about other men.

693
01:18:29,599 --> 01:18:31,232
I'm sure you don't
want to hear about

694
01:18:31,267 --> 01:18:32,869
a stranger satisfying
your wife,

695
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,803
and I swear it was only once.

696
01:18:35,472 --> 01:18:37,407
It was a mistake.

697
01:18:37,438 --> 01:18:40,410
It wasn't him
that I wanted.
I know that now.

698
01:18:40,441 --> 01:18:42,176
And I wish things
could just go back

699
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:43,612
to the way
they were before,

700
01:18:43,645 --> 01:18:45,480
but I don't see
how they could,

701
01:18:47,416 --> 01:18:49,384
not after the things
I've done.

702
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:55,589
What else
have you done, Pearl?

703
01:18:55,625 --> 01:18:57,592
Oh, Howard.

704
01:18:57,625 --> 01:18:59,930
I realize
how this all must sound.

705
01:19:01,396 --> 01:19:03,500
Honestly, there was a time
I was flattered

706
01:19:03,533 --> 01:19:06,501
to have someone
as handsome as you
pine over me.

707
01:19:06,536 --> 01:19:08,670
You're such a good person.
I know that.

708
01:19:09,974 --> 01:19:12,909
I made sure to always be
mindful with your heart.

709
01:19:12,941 --> 01:19:15,443
I never wanted you
to feel jealous.

710
01:19:16,779 --> 01:19:18,915
It's an awful feeling
like a rot,

711
01:19:18,949 --> 01:19:22,852
the way it just twists
and turns at your insides.

712
01:19:22,884 --> 01:19:24,955
I know that aching so well.

713
01:19:25,555 --> 01:19:27,791
I feel it.

714
01:19:27,824 --> 01:19:31,359
Whenever I see others
whose lives come easy

715
01:19:32,761 --> 01:19:35,630
because the truth is,
I'm not really a good person.

716
01:19:36,934 --> 01:19:38,102
Pearl, I think
I should just...

717
01:19:38,133 --> 01:19:40,835
The reason I kept my eyes to
the ground around other men

718
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:42,639
was never to avoid
hurting you.

719
01:19:44,741 --> 01:19:46,910
It's because I understood
how lucky I was

720
01:19:46,942 --> 01:19:49,312
to have your attention.

721
01:19:49,344 --> 01:19:52,880
I may be
a poor farm girl, Howard,
but I'm not stupid.

722
01:19:52,916 --> 01:19:56,584
I spotted you the moment
you came to live with us.

723
01:19:56,619 --> 01:19:58,722
You worked hard
like the other farmhands,

724
01:19:58,753 --> 01:20:00,490
but you were different.

725
01:20:00,521 --> 01:20:02,559
You're from somewhere.

726
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:04,327
A nice, comfortable place

727
01:20:04,358 --> 01:20:06,729
that you could return to
whenever you wanted.

728
01:20:08,999 --> 01:20:11,333
I'm so desperate
to have that.

729
01:20:13,301 --> 01:20:15,437
All my life,
I've wanted off this farm

730
01:20:15,472 --> 01:20:17,407
and you were my ticket out.

731
01:20:18,673 --> 01:20:20,274
So...

732
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:23,680
I made sure to never let you
see who I really was.

733
01:20:23,711 --> 01:20:26,282
It worked like a charm, too.

734
01:20:26,314 --> 01:20:28,685
Then when you finally
brought me back

735
01:20:28,716 --> 01:20:30,486
to your home
to meet your family,

736
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:31,956
it was just as I hoped.

737
01:20:33,755 --> 01:20:35,825
A life straight
out of the pictures.

738
01:20:37,692 --> 01:20:39,829
At least that's what
it felt like to me.

739
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:43,631
And you didn't want it.

740
01:20:46,970 --> 01:20:48,737
You just wanted
to stay here on our farm,

741
01:20:48,770 --> 01:20:50,605
and that made me so angry.

742
01:20:51,741 --> 01:20:53,077
How could you?

743
01:20:53,108 --> 01:20:56,312
I'm certain you knew
I hated it, you must've.

744
01:20:56,345 --> 01:20:58,414
How could you be
so selfish and cruel

745
01:20:58,448 --> 01:21:00,481
after all I've done
to make you happy?

746
01:21:05,854 --> 01:21:08,558
I was even pregnant
with your baby.

747
01:21:13,362 --> 01:21:16,699
I never wanted
to be a mother.

748
01:21:16,731 --> 01:21:20,401
I loathed the feeling of it
growing inside me.

749
01:21:20,436 --> 01:21:22,004
It felt like sickness.

750
01:21:24,074 --> 01:21:27,978
Pulling and sucking on me like
some needy animal in a barn.

751
01:21:29,746 --> 01:21:32,016
How could I be responsible
for another life?

752
01:21:32,981 --> 01:21:34,882
Life terrifies me.

753
01:21:34,916 --> 01:21:37,752
It's harsh, and bleak,
and draining.

754
01:21:40,022 --> 01:21:42,492
I was so relieved
when it died.

755
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:44,458
It was one less weight
keeping me trapped here,

756
01:21:44,494 --> 01:21:46,931
but then the war came
and you left me, too.

757
01:21:47,932 --> 01:21:50,065
Why did you leave me, Howard?

758
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:58,474
I hate feeling like this.

759
01:21:59,041 --> 01:22:01,442
So pathetic.

760
01:22:01,477 --> 01:22:03,847
Do people like you
ever feel this way?

761
01:22:04,581 --> 01:22:05,713
I figure you don't.

762
01:22:05,748 --> 01:22:07,882
You seem so perfect
all the time.

763
01:22:07,916 --> 01:22:10,551
Lord must've been
generous to you.

764
01:22:10,585 --> 01:22:12,990
He never answers
any of my prayers.

765
01:22:13,021 --> 01:22:15,523
I don't know why.
What did I do?

766
01:22:15,558 --> 01:22:17,625
What is wrong with me?

767
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:19,862
Please, just tell me
so maybe I can get better.

768
01:22:19,895 --> 01:22:21,462
I don't want to end up
like Mama.

769
01:22:21,497 --> 01:22:23,166
I want to be dancing up
on the screen

770
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,399
like the pretty gals
in the pictures.

771
01:22:26,734 --> 01:22:29,437
I want what they have
so badly,

772
01:22:29,472 --> 01:22:31,006
to be perfect,

773
01:22:31,041 --> 01:22:33,708
to be loved from
as many people as possible

774
01:22:33,743 --> 01:22:36,479
to make up for all my time
spent suffering.

775
01:22:39,183 --> 01:22:41,149
Sometimes I wake
in the middle of the night

776
01:22:41,185 --> 01:22:44,121
and the fear washes over me,
'cause what if this is it?

777
01:22:46,488 --> 01:22:48,125
What if this is
right where I belong?

778
01:22:53,862 --> 01:22:55,032
I'm a failure.

779
01:22:56,464 --> 01:22:57,600
I'm not pretty

780
01:22:59,103 --> 01:23:01,537
or naturally pleasant,
or friendly.

781
01:23:02,139 --> 01:23:03,604
I'm not smart,

782
01:23:04,241 --> 01:23:06,041
or funny, or confident.

783
01:23:08,478 --> 01:23:10,878
I'm exactly what Mama said
I was, weak.

784
01:23:12,214 --> 01:23:14,617
I don't know why.
What did I do?

785
01:23:14,649 --> 01:23:16,484
Why wasn't my family
like yours?

786
01:23:16,519 --> 01:23:19,555
I hate what it feels like
to be me and not you.

787
01:23:19,587 --> 01:23:21,522
I'm so scared that
when you finally come home,

788
01:23:21,557 --> 01:23:22,825
you'll see me
and be frightened

789
01:23:22,857 --> 01:23:24,592
like everyone else is.

790
01:23:27,863 --> 01:23:29,897
I know what I've done,

791
01:23:29,934 --> 01:23:31,133
the bad things,

792
01:23:32,167 --> 01:23:36,571
terrible, awful,
murderous things.

793
01:23:36,604 --> 01:23:39,041
I regret them now,
but I liked how they felt.

794
01:23:39,076 --> 01:23:40,910
I wish I didn't, but I did.

795
01:23:42,710 --> 01:23:45,848
At first, it was only animals
smaller than myself.

796
01:23:46,783 --> 01:23:47,882
Nothing with feelings.

797
01:23:47,916 --> 01:23:49,483
Nothing that could
hurt me back.

798
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:51,820
It felt good.

799
01:23:52,889 --> 01:23:54,689
Killing's easier
than you think,

800
01:23:56,091 --> 01:23:57,525
till recently with Mama

801
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:58,961
and the boy
from the picture house.

802
01:23:58,996 --> 01:24:00,062
They were different.

803
01:24:00,862 --> 01:24:02,699
They were more meaningful.

804
01:24:02,730 --> 01:24:04,565
I hurt them
so they too might know

805
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:05,702
what it feels like to suffer,

806
01:24:05,733 --> 01:24:07,204
but poor Daddy
didn't deserve that.

807
01:24:07,236 --> 01:24:09,503
I wish I hadn't done
what I did.

808
01:24:12,142 --> 01:24:13,643
Mama meant well.

809
01:24:14,811 --> 01:24:17,081
She had a hard life.

810
01:24:17,113 --> 01:24:18,915
She only wanted a home
to feel safe in.

811
01:24:18,949 --> 01:24:20,048
I can see that.

812
01:24:20,916 --> 01:24:21,984
I thought I hated her,

813
01:24:22,019 --> 01:24:23,786
but I just want to
feel safe, too.

814
01:24:28,756 --> 01:24:29,826
Lord...

815
01:24:31,094 --> 01:24:33,962
I made
such a mess of things.

816
01:24:35,165 --> 01:24:37,232
I don't know how much more
I can take.

817
01:24:39,103 --> 01:24:40,603
I need to clean this up.

818
01:24:41,737 --> 01:24:43,974
All of it.

819
01:24:44,006 --> 01:24:46,942
I need to make things right
before you see me again.

820
01:24:48,644 --> 01:24:50,279
Maybe if I can turn this farm

821
01:24:50,312 --> 01:24:52,047
into a home for us
like you wanted,

822
01:24:52,082 --> 01:24:53,916
things will finally
be different.

823
01:24:53,951 --> 01:24:56,686
I can forgive.

824
01:24:57,585 --> 01:24:59,187
I can be
who you want me to be

825
01:25:00,057 --> 01:25:01,791
if you'll just stay with me.

826
01:25:03,191 --> 01:25:04,926
Would you do that, please?

827
01:25:07,795 --> 01:25:09,766
I can't be
all by myself anymore.

828
01:25:09,797 --> 01:25:10,867
It's too hard.

829
01:25:15,337 --> 01:25:17,172
We can love each other.

830
01:25:17,207 --> 01:25:19,143
I'll do that for you

831
01:25:19,174 --> 01:25:22,312
if you really meant all that
"till death do us part."

832
01:25:24,613 --> 01:25:25,848
It'd be enough,

833
01:25:27,850 --> 01:25:30,719
just you and me
here on this farm.

834
01:25:37,327 --> 01:25:39,693
All I really want
is to be loved.

835
01:25:43,333 --> 01:25:46,036
I'm having such a hard time
without it lately.

836
01:26:22,938 --> 01:26:25,741
I should probably
get going now.

837
01:26:25,773 --> 01:26:28,776
Mother will be
wondering where I am
if I'm not home soon.

838
01:26:37,719 --> 01:26:39,187
Are you
frightened of me?

839
01:26:41,256 --> 01:26:42,257
No.

840
01:26:45,395 --> 01:26:46,729
Of course not, Pearl.

841
01:26:50,298 --> 01:26:51,899
Do you think I'm sick?

842
01:26:54,002 --> 01:26:55,003
No.

843
01:26:57,241 --> 01:26:58,242
Thank you.

844
01:27:02,145 --> 01:27:03,812
I'm happy for you.

845
01:27:07,117 --> 01:27:08,716
What?

846
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:09,917
For getting the part

847
01:27:10,954 --> 01:27:13,088
in the dance troupe.
You deserved it.

848
01:27:15,257 --> 01:27:18,026
-I didn't get the part.
-It's okay.

849
01:27:19,195 --> 01:27:20,430
You don't have to
pretend anymore.

850
01:27:20,462 --> 01:27:22,032
My feelings won't be hurt.

851
01:27:23,433 --> 01:27:25,666
If it wasn't me, I'm glad
it was you, right?

852
01:27:28,904 --> 01:27:30,974
-But, Pearl, I...
-Please...

853
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:33,841
Don't lie to me.

854
01:27:40,517 --> 01:27:43,353
Well, yes.

855
01:27:45,921 --> 01:27:47,088
Thank you.

856
01:27:50,091 --> 01:27:51,995
It's going to be
real swell,

857
01:27:53,062 --> 01:27:55,063
dancing around the state.

858
01:27:58,268 --> 01:28:01,871
I hope you can come
see the show sometime.

859
01:28:05,507 --> 01:28:07,742
You always get
everything you want.

860
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:12,249
You're younger
and more blonde.

861
01:28:14,451 --> 01:28:17,085
I have to go now.

862
01:28:21,058 --> 01:28:23,358
You're not gonna
say anything, are you?

863
01:28:25,094 --> 01:28:26,262
No.

864
01:28:32,936 --> 01:28:35,169
I really do love Howard.

865
01:28:38,006 --> 01:28:39,174
I know.

866
01:28:40,342 --> 01:28:41,911
Nobody has to know.

867
01:28:42,945 --> 01:28:44,212
I can fix things.

868
01:28:45,848 --> 01:28:48,018
It can be
our secret, Mitsy.

869
01:29:39,067 --> 01:29:40,335
Help!

870
01:29:41,538 --> 01:29:42,872
Help me!

871
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:46,076
Somebody, please help!

872
01:29:46,107 --> 01:29:48,043
No!

873
01:29:48,543 --> 01:29:50,012
No, please.

874
01:29:50,045 --> 01:29:52,147
Help! Help!

875
01:30:03,925 --> 01:30:05,859
Help!

876
01:30:08,463 --> 01:30:10,231
Help me, please!

877
01:30:10,267 --> 01:30:12,067
Help!

878
01:30:21,176 --> 01:30:23,211
Please, no! No!

879
01:30:23,979 --> 01:30:25,282
I won't tell anyone!

880
01:30:25,313 --> 01:30:26,880
Please, I swear!

881
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:28,983
No!

882
01:30:29,019 --> 01:30:32,520
Please! I'll do anything
you want.

883
01:30:32,556 --> 01:30:35,625
It's not about
what I want anymore, Mitsy.

884
01:30:35,659 --> 01:30:36,591
Please.

885
01:30:36,625 --> 01:30:39,329
It's about making the best
of what I have.

886
01:30:39,362 --> 01:30:42,199
No! No!

887
01:30:43,367 --> 01:30:45,133
No!

888
01:33:50,818 --> 01:33:53,187
Bless us, O' Lord,

889
01:33:53,223 --> 01:33:55,857
and these thy gifts

890
01:33:55,892 --> 01:33:59,627
which we are about to receive
from thy bounty,

891
01:34:01,462 --> 01:34:03,366
through Christ our Lord.

892
01:34:04,732 --> 01:34:06,167
Amen.

893
01:34:46,174 --> 01:34:47,477
So long, y'all.

894
01:35:05,562 --> 01:35:06,695
Pearl?

895
01:35:12,937 --> 01:35:14,168
Pearl?

896
01:35:36,357 --> 01:35:37,359
Howard?

897
01:35:40,596 --> 01:35:42,933
I'm so happy you're home.
