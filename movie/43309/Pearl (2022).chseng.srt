That is enough, then.

157
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,310
你吃了糖 那就是你的晚饭了
You ate the candy, that was your supper.

158
00:23:31,338 --> 00:23:35,208
而不是我独自一人 辛辛苦苦准备的餐食
The food I worked hard to prepare alone is not.

159
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,447
但妈妈 我赶了好远的路 我很饿
But, Mama, I rode all that way. I'm starving.

160
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:41,848
你可以等明早再吃剩下的
You may have what's left of it in the morning.

161
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:48,430
- 你要去哪里  - 睡觉
-Where are you going? -To bed!

162
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,958
我还没允许你下桌
I did not excuse you from the table.

163
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:54,489
坐下

164
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:05,250
这个家没有多少钱能糊口了

165
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:08,050
时代不同了 珠儿

166
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,760
你不能再粗心大意

167
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:17,718
想要活命 完全只取决于你我两个人

168
00:24:18,968 --> 00:24:21,848
你也看到人们对待德国农民的样子了

169
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:29,438
我们唯一没有染病或挨饿的原因就是小心谨慎地过活

170
00:24:29,828 --> 00:24:31,098
我知道
I know that.

171
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,968
我有很小心
And I am careful.

172
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:40,500
我不允许你再沉迷愚蠢的幻想 并且逃避责任了

173
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,000
这是懦弱的表现

174
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,290
你父亲和我没把你养得这么懦弱

175
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,708
清楚了吗?

176
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,088
很好
Good.

177
00:24:53,088 --> 00:24:55,389
你可以下桌了

178
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,880
主啊 求求你
Please, Lord,

179
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:17,348
让我成为全世界最著名的明星
make me the biggest star the world has ever known

180
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,218
让我能离这个地方远远的
so that I may get far, far away from this place.

181
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,290
阿门
Amen.

182
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,229
下午好 珠儿
Afternoon, Pearl!

183
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,198
米斯蒂 我喜欢你的裙子
Hi, Mitsy! I like your dress.

184
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,000
噢 谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

185
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,968
终于能打扮漂亮的感觉
It feels wonderful to finally be able to

186
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,938
真的是太好了
don something pretty again.

187
00:26:48,968 --> 00:26:50,968
这是几周以来我们第一次离开家
It's the first time we've left home in weeks.

188
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,208
妈妈特别害怕染上病
Mother is so afraid of getting ill.

189
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:54,510
我妈妈也是
Mama, too.

190
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,979
我们还有一点担心
Well, we were a bit worried

191
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:58,208
你们两个单独住得这么远
about the both of you being out here all alone,

192
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,218
我们带了点吃的来
so we brought some food.

193
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,680
真是太好心了
That's very kind.

194
00:27:01,718 --> 00:27:03,250
你最近还好吗?
How have you been getting on?

195
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,188
有霍华德的消息吗?
Any new letters from Howard?

196
00:27:06,218 --> 00:27:07,688
这个嘛...
Oh, well...

197
00:27:07,718 --> 00:27:10,458
妈妈一直非常担心
Mother has been riddled with worry.

198
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:13,260
但人们说 没有消息就是好消息
They say no news is good news, though.

199
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,000
要是他没有因为尊严
If only his pride hadn't gotten him

200
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,129
去参与这场可怕的战争就好了
involved in this dreadful war.

201
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,270
要知道我们认识个医生
You know we had a doctor

202
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,270
可以判定他不符合入伍资格的
willing to declare him ineligible?

203
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,409
换谁都会抓住机会躲过去的
Anyone would've taken that opportunity.

204
00:27:22,438 --> 00:27:23,310
霍华德可不是
Not Howard.

205
00:27:23,338 --> 00:27:26,109
他先是跑出去当了农民
First, he runs off to become a farmer.

206
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,410
现在又参军
Now, the army.

207
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:31,479
真是为了惹父亲生气什么都肯做
The lengths my brother will go to just to spite his father.

208
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,318
这样一直远离人烟
All this isolation has been enough

209
00:27:33,348 --> 00:27:35,078
足够让人发疯了 是吧?
to make one mad, hasn't it?

210
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,550
确实是
It really has.

211
00:27:37,588 --> 00:27:39,989
我们不接受施舍
No, we don't accept charity.

212
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,458
天啊 露丝 只是头猪而已
Oh, for God's sake, Ruth. It's just a pig.

213
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,468
珠儿 我能跟你讲个小秘密吗?
Can I share a secret with you, Pearl?

214
00:27:52,598 --> 00:27:54,270
妈妈可能会掐死我
Mother would throttle me

215
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,540
如果她知道了我打算干什么
if she knew I was planning on attending.

216
00:27:56,568 --> 00:27:59,680
这周六在教堂有一场选拔
But there's a dance audition this Saturday at our church

217
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:01,510
是一个圣诞舞团
for a Christmas chorus line

218
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,448
给全国的老百姓
to bring merriment to folks

219
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:04,680
带来节日的快乐
throughout the state during the holidays.

220
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:07,619
有消息说哦 他们组织的这个舞团
Word is, they're putting together a troupe

221
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,790
将在七个不同的城市巡演
and will be touring seven different cities

222
00:28:09,818 --> 00:28:11,149
就在年底之前
before the year ends.

223
00:28:11,188 --> 00:28:13,060
听起来是不是很棒?
Don't that sound exciting?

224
00:28:13,088 --> 00:28:15,359
我真希望能成为其中的一员
I would love so much to be a part of it.

225
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,630
我也是
So would I.

226
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,630
那我们应该一起去
We should go together then.

227
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,430
但你不许告诉任何人
But you can't tell a soul.

228
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:22,729
我绝对不说
I would never.

229
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:25,198
太棒了 这是我们的小秘密
Splendid. It'll be our secret.

230
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:26,640
米斯蒂
Mitsy!

231
00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:28,438
我该走啦
I better skedaddle.

232
00:28:28,468 --> 00:28:31,640
这个下午还有三头猪要送出去
We got three more pigs to drop off this afternoon.

233
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,208
周六 十一点钟
Saturday at 11:00.

234
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,650
好的
Okay.

235
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,650
亲家姐妹就得抱团 对吧?
Sister-in-laws have to stick together, right?

236
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,680
米斯蒂!
Mitsy!

237
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:43,218
- 该走了  - 回见 珠儿
-Time to go! -See you later, Pearl.

238
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,458
拜拜 米斯蒂
Bye, Mitsy!

239
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,197
查莉 也许就是这次了
Charlie, this could be it.

240
00:30:08,838 --> 00:30:10,208
珠儿?
Pearl?

241
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,280
珠儿!
Pearl!

242
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:27,400
《埃及艳后》《百丽宫富丽秀》

243
00:32:00,979 --> 00:32:02,318
哇哦
Well,

244
00:32:02,348 --> 00:32:04,489
没想到这么快就又来了
I didn't expect to see you again this soon.

245
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:25,540
坐吧
Have a seat.

246
00:32:36,348 --> 00:32:37,619
我简直不相信你能
I can't believe you get to see

247
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,718
每天都免费看电影
the pictures every day for free.

248
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,489
确实 这活计不错
Yeah, not a bad gig, huh?

249
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,560
谢谢你
Thank you.

250
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,000
那么 是有何事光临寒舍?
So, to what do I owe this pleasure?

251
00:32:54,068 --> 00:32:55,568
我想了很多
I've been thinking a lot about

252
00:32:55,609 --> 00:32:57,010
你那天说的话
what you said to me the other day

253
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,040
让我别忘了过自己的人生
about not forgetting to live my life,

254
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:01,310
然后
and, well,

255
00:33:01,338 --> 00:33:04,078
教堂将要举办一场舞蹈选拔
there's a dance audition coming up at the church.

256
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:05,718
听起来不错
Oh, I like the sound of that.

257
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,750
我也这么觉得
So do I...

258
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:11,619
但我从来没有在别人面前跳过舞
But I've never really danced in front of anyone before.

259
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,530
如果我做不到完美怎么办?
What if I'm not perfect?

260
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,659
只要够渴望 你能做到任何事
You can do anything if you want it bad enough.

261
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,500
我很渴望
I want it.

262
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,598
那就别让任何事阻碍你
Then don't let anything stand in your way.

263
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:27,500
你想看什么?
What would you like to see?

264
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:29,540
百丽宫富丽秀
Palace Follies.

265
00:33:29,568 --> 00:33:32,409
别这样 你都看过那部了
Oh, come on. You saw that already.

266
00:33:32,438 --> 00:33:33,708
不如今晚看点不一样的?
How about something different tonight?

267
00:33:33,739 --> 00:33:34,979
不如...
How about...

268
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,750
看一部谁都没看过的电影?
How about a film nobody else has seen?

269
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,050
好啊
Okay.

270
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,818
这一部胶片是
I picked this one up while

271
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:47,588
我在法国服役时遇到的
I was in the service in France.

272
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,828
你住在这里吗?
Do you live in here?

273
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:00,800
我偶尔会在这床上睡一觉
I lay my head on that pillow from time to time,

274
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:03,668
但我没有特定的居所
but I wouldn't say I live anywhere in particular.

275
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:07,410
我是大部分人口中的波西米亚人
I'm what more civilized people refer to as bohemian.

276
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:09,948
我不知道那是什么
I don't know what that is.

277
00:34:09,979 --> 00:34:13,520
意思就是我随时都可以卷铺盖离开
It means I can pack up and leave whenever I want to.

278
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:16,388
听起来像个美梦
Sounds like a dream.

279
00:34:16,417 --> 00:34:18,917
我尽量让梦不醒过来吧
Just as long as I can keep from waking up.

280
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,928
这是什么片子?
What is this?

281
00:34:45,928 --> 00:34:46,550
姑娘们 要搭车吗?

282
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,888
看就是了
Just watch.

283
00:35:19,979 --> 00:35:22,888
是不是从来没见过这样的电影?
Never seen anything like that before now, have you?

284
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,790
有各种各样的地下情色片
There are all kinds of underground stag films

285
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,030
就像这部一样
like this out there.

286
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,060
这合法吗?
Is it legal?

287
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:33,830
做爱吗 合法
Doing it, yeah.

288
00:35:34,928 --> 00:35:36,530
但拍摄就不了
Filming it, no.

289
00:35:37,698 --> 00:35:40,770
至少在这不合法 但有朝一日会合法的
Not here, anyway. It will be eventually.

290
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,468
人们会花一切代价来看的
People would pay an arm and a leg to see this.

291
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,908
这样的电影会在行业里掀起革命的
Pictures like this are going to revolutionize the industry

292
00:35:46,938 --> 00:35:50,208
而我 打算早早地借此盈利
and I, for one, plan on capitalizing early.

293
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,648
这就是现实
It's reality.

294
00:35:53,678 --> 00:35:56,688
无可否认 我们都着迷于
There's no denying we all share a fascination

295
00:35:56,718 --> 00:35:59,620
看到人们真实的一面
in seeing people as they truly are.

296
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,458
我不太喜欢现实
I don't like reality.

297
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:07,729
我是指我住的地方
Where I live, I mean.

298
00:36:08,628 --> 00:36:09,799
那就离开
So leave.

299
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,580
不是那么简单的事
It's not that easy.

300
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,708
当然很简单
Well, sure it is.

301
00:36:20,739 --> 00:36:21,739
这门前就有条路
There's a road right out front there

302
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,708
能够直达纽约市
that'll take you all the way to New York City.

303
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,878
总有一天我的爸爸妈妈会不在了
One day my mother and father will be gone.

304
00:36:29,648 --> 00:36:31,620
那时我就能为所欲为了
I can do what I want then.

305
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,020
如果那时太晚了呢
What if that's too late?

306
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,560
珠儿 这件事的问题就在于
The fact and truth of the matter is, Pearl,

307
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,928
你的人生只有一次机会
you only get one take at this life.

308
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:42,299
如果你不趁年轻时好好活着
And if you don't make the most of it when you're young,

309
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:44,168
就没法再来一次了
you don't get a second chance.

310
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:49,570
要是他们死掉就好了
If only they would just die.

311
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:54,878
什么?
Pardon?

312
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,520
没什么
Nothing.

313
00:37:03,948 --> 00:37:07,290
能跟别人说说话的感觉真好
It's real nice to be able to talk to someone for a change.

314
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,830
在那个农场待得太久了
Been cooped up on that farm for so long

315
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,898
有时我都担心会不会
sometimes I worry that maybe

316
00:37:11,928 --> 00:37:14,560
自己跟别人都不一样了
I'm not the same as other people.

317
00:37:15,729 --> 00:37:18,698
你为什么想要跟别人一个样呢?
Why would you ever want to be like everybody else?

318
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,698
我不知道
I don't know.

319
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,138
感觉那样更安宁吧
Sometimes it just seems more peaceful, I guess.

320
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,188
你之前说的是真心话吗?
Did you mean what you said?

321
00:37:40,218 --> 00:37:42,628
说想在大银幕上看到我?
About wanting to see me up on that screen?

322
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,300
当然了
Sure, I did.

323
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,229
为此我愿意做任何事
I'd do anything to be up there.

324
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,370
这样的话你得出国
Well, then, you ought to go overseas

325
00:37:51,398 --> 00:37:53,100
等流行病过去的
when this pandemic ends.

326
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:54,739
我就是这么打算的
That's what I'm doing.

327
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:57,110
欧洲的艺术界更加鲜活
The arts are so much more alive in Europe.

328
00:37:57,138 --> 00:37:59,080
在那边 你可以成为任何人
You can be whoever you want to be there.

329
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:01,677
真的吗?
Really?

330
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:03,279
你甚至可以出演这样的电影
You could even be in pictures like this.

331
00:38:04,678 --> 00:38:05,918
我反正很愿意看你
I know I'd watch you.

332
00:38:12,388 --> 00:38:13,888
我该走了
I should go now.

333
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,760
谢谢你
Thank you.

334
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,260
谢什么?
What for?

335
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,830
谢谢今晚能见我
For seeing me tonight.

336
00:39:48,418 --> 00:39:49,887
你在看什么?
What are you staring at?

337
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:34,157
希达!
Theda!

338
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,770
我就要走了
I'm leaving soon.

339
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,378
我不能再在这待着了
I can't stay here any longer.

340
00:40:55,188 --> 00:40:57,250
霍华德本来该带我走的
Howard was supposed to take me away.

341
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,259
这样我会好受些
It'd be easier for me

342
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:03,790
不会觉得是我抛弃了你
if I didn't feel like I was abandoning you.

343
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,100
你能理解吗?
You understand that?

344
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:16,138
我爱你 爹地 但这样简直不叫活着
I love you, Daddy, but this is no way to live.

345
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:21,479
珠儿?
Pearl?

346
00:41:23,448 --> 00:41:24,908
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

347
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,320
我在跟爹地说话
Talking with Daddy.

348
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,888
我们得带他回屋里去
We need to get him back to the house.

349
00:41:36,989 --> 00:41:38,428
你为什么恨我 妈妈
Why do you hate me, Mama?

350
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,270
我只是顾全大局
I only want what's best.

351
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:48,840
什么时候才能得到我想要的?
When do I get what I want?

352
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:53,310
有一天你会明白的
One day you'll understand

353
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:56,350
你想要什么并不重要
that getting what you want isn't what's important.

354
00:41:58,878 --> 00:42:00,918
充分利用你所有的才重要
Making the most of what you have is.

355
00:42:02,148 --> 00:42:05,188
人生很少能按你的期待发展
Life rarely turns out how you expect.

356
00:42:05,218 --> 00:42:06,520
你得做好面对这些的准备
You need to be prepared for that

357
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,290
如果你想过得幸福的话
if you ever want to be happy.

358
00:42:10,158 --> 00:42:11,388
回屋里来吧
Come back inside.

359
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,948
你在哪?
Where are you?

360
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:47,658
别盯着我看了
Stop staring at me.

361
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,218
你怎么找到这个的?
How'd you find that?

362
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:54,388
什么事情我都有看在眼里
I am not blind to what goes on around here.

363
00:44:54,418 --> 00:44:56,759
拿上你的晚饭 待在隔离房里
Take your dinner. Stay in the bunkhouse.

364
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:58,428
但是外面那么冷!
But it's freezing out there!

365
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:01,229
你在拿我冒险之前就该想清楚的
You should've thought of that before putting me at risk.

366
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,270
隔离到确定你没有生病为止
Isolate yourself until we know you're not ill.

367
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,570
这样做才对
That is what's right.

368
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:12,310
明天镇上有一场舞蹈选拔
There's a dance audition in town tomorrow.

369
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,208
我要去
I'm going to it.

370
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,750
你不能去
No, you're not.

371
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,520
- 我要去  - 为什么?
-Yes, I am. -Why?

372
00:45:22,688 --> 00:45:24,589
看看我的能耐到底够不够大
Find out if I'm good enough.

373
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,290
够不够做什么 珠儿?
Good enough for what, Pearl?

374
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:34,428
不止于此的人生
Something more than this.

375
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:41,168
这些不知感恩的倔强都是哪来的?
Where does all this ungratefulness stem from?

376
00:45:41,198 --> 00:45:44,340
你觉得我们的生活与你不配吗?
How is it you find our life so beneath you?

377
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:46,339
你从来都有屋可栖
You've always had a roof over your head,

378
00:45:46,378 --> 00:45:48,479
有食果腹
food in your belly.

379
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:50,648
你就没想过这些都是你父亲和我
Do you not think that came at great sacrifice

380
00:45:50,678 --> 00:45:52,620
做出的牺牲换来的吗?
from your father and I?

381
00:45:52,648 --> 00:45:55,750
还是说你认为我们也配不上你?
Or do you think we are beneath you, too?

382
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:57,590
如果我的余生注定都要
If I'm meant to live out the rest of my days

383
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,387
跟你和爹地住在这个农场
with you and Daddy on this farm,

384
00:45:59,418 --> 00:46:00,520
那就这样吧
then so be it.

385
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,229
但我的青春只有一次
But I'm only young once.

386
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,128
如果我参加了选拔并且没被选上
If I go to this audition and I don't get picked,

387
00:46:06,158 --> 00:46:07,360
那我就回到家
then I'll come home

388
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:10,628
而且以后再也不提了 我发誓
and I'll never speak of it again, I swear.

389
00:46:10,668 --> 00:46:12,370
但我必须要知道我尽力了
But I have to know that I tried

390
00:46:12,398 --> 00:46:14,239
不然我会后悔一辈子的
or I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life.

391
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:17,110
求你了妈妈 你不知道我的能耐
Please, Mama. You have no idea what I'm capable of.

392
00:46:18,878 --> 00:46:20,339
噢 我知道得很清楚
Oh, yes, I do.

393
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,780
我见过你在私底下做的事
I've seen the things you've done in private,

394
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,520
你以为没人在看的时候
when you believe no one is watching.

395
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:31,819
你以为别人不会注意到吗?
You think others won't notice?

396
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:35,590
你把你的本性永远藏好了 珠儿
You can't keep your true self hidden forever, Pearl.

397
00:46:35,628 --> 00:46:38,628
他们最终会注意到的 而且会被吓到的
They will notice eventually, and they will be frightened,

398
00:46:39,658 --> 00:46:41,100
就像我一样
just as I am.

399
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,739
- 你错了  - 是吗?
-You're wrong. -Am I?

400
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:49,739
你想成为的是多优秀的女人啊
Then what a fine woman you hope to become,

401
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,438
扔下你的母亲 独自腐朽
leaving your mother alone to rot

402
00:46:51,468 --> 00:46:54,510
就为了能跟一群城里的妓女跳舞
so you can dance with a bunch of city whores.

403
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,378
更别说你可能染上的疾病了
Let alone the illness you may contract and spread.

404
00:46:57,408 --> 00:46:59,320
你见过这病让你父亲变成什么样
You've seen what it does to your father.

405
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,350
这就是你希望自己和别人得到的下场吗?
That's what you want for yourself and others?

406
00:47:01,378 --> 00:47:03,888
也许你希望我是这个下场
And maybe that is what you wish for me.

407
00:47:03,918 --> 00:47:06,560
- 当然不是  - 别撒谎了!
-Of course not. -Stop lying!

408
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,658
我再也忍不了听到这些了
I can't stand the sound of it anymore!

409
00:47:08,688 --> 00:47:12,299
这跟你罪恶的行径一样可憎
It's almost as abhorrent as your sinful behavior!

410
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:15,529
你不正常 珠儿
You are not well, Pearl!

411
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:18,198
这样下去迟早会伤害到别人
It's only a matter of time before you hurt someone else.

412
00:47:18,229 --> 00:47:22,510
邪恶正在蚕食你的内心 我看得出
Malevolence is festering in you, I see it.

413
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,668
而且以后我要严正明确
And I will not, in good conscious,

414
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,580
不再让你离开这个农场
let you leave this farm again.

415
00:47:27,739 --> 00:47:29,510
你阻止不了我的
You can't stop me.

416
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:31,208
噢 我太可以了
Oh, yes, I can.

417
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,918
你不想知道我能对你做出什么事的
You don't want to know what I could do to you.

418
00:47:33,948 --> 00:47:37,958
我背负着你永远无法理解的负担
I shoulder a burden you will never understand,

419
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:39,918
每天只能给我嫁的人喂食
spend my days feeding and wiping the snot

420
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:42,229
擦鼻涕 如此度日
off the face of the man I married.

421
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:45,560
你胆敢坐在这里跟我谈后悔?
You dare sit there and talk to me about regret?

422
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,668
我本应是他的妻子 不该给他当妈!
I was supposed to be his wife, not his mother!

423
00:47:48,698 --> 00:47:51,398
你再敢用这种口气跟我说话试试!
Don't you ever speak that way to me again!

424
00:47:51,428 --> 00:47:52,770
你听到了吗?
Do you hear me?

425
00:47:53,698 --> 00:47:55,739
- 抱歉  - 你才不抱歉
-I'm sorry. -No! You're not!

426
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:57,610
不然你就会停止这种行为了
Or you would stop all this!

427
00:47:57,638 --> 00:47:59,239
给 拿着
Here! Take it!

428
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,350
这就是你想要的 是不是?
That's what you really desire, isn't it?

429
00:48:02,378 --> 00:48:04,918
也许我该为你杀了他?
Perhaps I should kill him for you?

430
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:07,418
这样你就不用再继续照顾他了
That way you don't have to care for him any longer.

431
00:48:07,448 --> 00:48:10,418
这是不是圆了你自私的梦想?
Would that suit your selfish dreams better?

432
00:48:10,448 --> 00:48:12,590
那样我们俩都可以去舞蹈选拔了
Then we can both go to the dance audition!

433
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,989
你的丈夫不在了 我的也一样
Your husband is gone. So is mine.

434
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:16,790
所以我们何必被照顾他们所束缚
Why should we be saddled with caring for them

435
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:18,428
或者被农场拖累?
or the work of this farm?

436
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:21,330
不如我们都去追求自己的愿望!
What about us getting what we want?

437
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:31,540
我不要再为你受任何苦了
I won't suffer for you any longer.

438
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:34,780
你想走吗 走吧
You want to leave? Go.

439
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,378
但当你失败
But when you fail...

440
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:39,520
而且你必定会失败
And you will fail...

441
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:42,918
我要你记住那是什么感觉
I want you to remember what it feels like

442
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:49,260
因为我每次看到你 都是这个感觉
because that's how I feel every time I look at you.

443
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:53,360
我的一切几乎都被夺走了 珠儿
Nearly everything I ever had has been taken from me, Pearl.

444
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,000
你还想要什么?
What more do you want?

445
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,040
我只是不想沦落成你这样
I just don't want to end up like you, is all.

446
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:15,648
我恨你!
I hate you!

447
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,418
你这娼妓!
You harlot!

448
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:21,760
我不会再让你当着我的面趾高气扬
I won't let you your arrogance in my face!

449
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:24,860
- 你并不比我强!  - 我就是比你强
-You are not better than me! -Yes, I am!

450
00:49:24,898 --> 00:49:27,029
我要成为大明星
I'm going to be a star!

451
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,799
全世界都要知道我的大名!
The whole world is going to know my name!

452
00:52:06,888 --> 00:52:09,489
你要去哪里 现在都还没到早上六点
Where are you going? It's not even 6:00 a.m. yet.

453
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:11,128
我要去练习
I have to practice my routine.

454
00:52:11,158 --> 00:52:13,760
今天的选拔必须准备充分
I need to be perfect for my audition today.

455
00:52:16,729 --> 00:52:18,870
你还认为我够漂亮吗?
You still think I'm pretty enough?

456
00:52:18,898 --> 00:52:21,198
过去24小时内没什么变化
Oh, not much has changed in the last 24 hours.

457
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:22,810
还是有变化的
Yes, it has.

458
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,678
你上次忘记了这个
Oh. You forgot this last time.

459
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,979
很高兴你能回来
I'm glad you came back.

460
00:52:31,878 --> 00:52:33,819
我也是
So am I.

461
00:52:39,218 --> 00:52:40,958
至少让我载你回家吧
Let me at least drive you home.

462
00:52:54,138 --> 00:52:55,739
是你认识的人吗?
Somebody you know?

463
00:52:58,908 --> 00:53:00,638
我不太确定
I'm not really sure.

464
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:03,678
确实
Well...

465
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:05,218
现在很难认出谁是谁
It's hard to know who anyone is nowadays

466
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,120
大家脸上都遮着盖着
with all these masks people are wearing.

467
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:39,148
在这稍等一下
Wait here a minute.

468
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:04,239
爹地 我真对不起
Daddy, I'm so sorry.

469
00:54:25,688 --> 00:54:27,657
我很快就给你清理干净好吗
I'm going to get you cleaned up real soon, okay?

470
00:54:27,698 --> 00:54:28,928
只是我现在有个客人
I just have a guest right now.

471
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:00,729
好了 进来吧
Okay, come in!

472
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,250
这是我父亲
This is my father.

473
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:25,888
很高兴见到您 先生
Pleased to meet you, sir.

474
00:55:34,128 --> 00:55:35,898
想去我的房间吗?
Want to go up to my bedroom now?

475
00:55:42,708 --> 00:55:44,770
我想要永远离开这个农场
I want off this farm forever.

476
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,378
但是这里看起来还不赖
I don't know. It doesn't seem so bad.

477
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:51,350
确实不赖
It is.

478
00:55:52,448 --> 00:55:55,418
那是怎么回事?
What was that?

479
00:55:55,448 --> 00:55:57,918
没什么
Nothing.

480
00:55:57,948 --> 00:56:00,320
再跟我讲讲欧洲
Tell me more about Europe.

481
00:56:01,188 --> 00:56:02,427
我们什么时候可以去?
When can we go?

482
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:06,300
你不想去查看一下吗?
Don't you think you should go check?

483
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:08,398
不想
No.

484
00:56:10,898 --> 00:56:12,270
行了 很抱歉
All right. I'm sorry.

485
00:56:12,938 --> 00:56:13,968
但是不管什么动静
Whatever that is,

486
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,698
我们不能当没听见
we can't just ignore it.

487
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,208
万一是你爸爸有什么事呢
It could be your father, for Christ's sake.

488
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:19,080
不是我爸爸
It's not my father.

489
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:21,979
求你别走
Please don't go.

490
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:24,750
你是怎么回事?
What's the matter with you?

491
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:27,820
没什么
Nothing.

492
00:57:18,438 --> 00:57:20,370
是我们家的狗
It's our dog.

493
00:57:20,398 --> 00:57:22,208
趁我不在她把厨房搞得一团糟
She made a mess in the kitchen while I was away,

494
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:23,540
我把她锁在地窖里了
so I put her in the root cellar.

495
00:57:26,408 --> 00:57:27,908
我想给你看点东西
I want to show you something.

496
00:57:34,948 --> 00:57:36,320
这是查莉
That's Charlie!

497
00:57:37,148 --> 00:57:39,418
她总是很饿
She's always hungry.

498
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:41,958
我们没钱像以前那样喂饱她
We can't afford to feed her like we used to.

499
00:57:41,989 --> 00:57:45,030
这边这位是玛丽
And over here, this is Mary.

500
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,330
她是不是很可爱
Ain't she a dish?

501
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:50,530
这是弗兰西斯
This is Francis.

502
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,540
他们都是我最棒的观众
They're my best audience.

503
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:57,438
我用最喜欢的电影明星给他们起名
I named each of them after my favorite picture stars.

504
00:57:57,468 --> 00:58:01,040
多年以来我给他们表演过无数次
I've put on so many shows for them over the years.

505
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,110
很伤心要道别 但就像人们说的
It'll be sad to say goodbye, but like they say,

506
00:58:03,148 --> 00:58:04,479
在演艺圈就像逆水行舟
"If you're not moving forward in show business,

507
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:05,780
不进则退
"you're moving backwards."

508
00:58:06,878 --> 00:58:08,888
我们以前养着更多的牲口
We used to have many more animals,

509
00:58:09,918 --> 00:58:11,120
但它们都死了
but they all died.

510
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:13,820
那你的狗呢?
What about your dog?

511
00:58:15,489 --> 00:58:18,090
- 狗叫什么名字?  - 我们没养狗
-What's its name? -We don't have a dog.

512
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:22,198
我以为你说有狗的?
I thought you said you, uh, did?

513
00:58:22,229 --> 00:58:23,800
在地窖里?
In the cellar?

514
00:58:27,138 --> 00:58:31,138
哦对
Right. Yeah.

515
00:58:31,168 --> 00:58:35,208
这个 呃...
Yeah, well, um...

516
00:58:36,178 --> 00:58:38,850
天啊
Oh, boy.

517
00:58:38,878 --> 00:58:41,049
这个 我该往回走了
Oh, I better be getting back, you know?

518
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:45,218
- 什么?  - 我得走了
-What? -Oh, I've got to go

519
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,388
还要放映日场电影
and screen the matinee, you know,

520
00:58:46,418 --> 00:58:48,020
你还得练习呢 记得吗?
but you gotta practice, remember?

521
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:49,560
你得让舞步更加完美
You gotta get those dance moves perfect.

522
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:51,560
现在绝对不是
Now's not the time to be

523
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:53,300
松懈休息的时候对吧?
resting on your laurels, is it?

524
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:57,198
能见你很高兴 珠儿
Nice seeing you, Pearl.

525
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:03,010
我做错什么事了吗?
Did I do something wrong?

526
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,040
没有
No.

527
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:10,080
那你为什么忽然对我冷淡了?
Then why did you just go cold on me?

528
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,020
我不懂你意思
I don't know what you mean.

529
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,188
你看到什么了?
What did you see?

530
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:18,958
我什么都没看到
I didn't see anything.

531
00:59:21,158 --> 00:59:23,158
你在撒谎
You're lying.

532
00:59:23,188 --> 00:59:25,330
- 我没撒谎  - 你在撒谎
-No, I'm not. -Yes, you are.

533
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:29,968
我很清楚 我的感知非常深刻
I know because I feel things very deeply.

534
00:59:31,428 --> 00:59:33,100
听着 我得回去工作了 好吗?
Look, I've got to get back to work, all right?

535
00:59:33,138 --> 00:59:34,540
- 我们晚点再见  - 什么时候?
-I'll... I'll see you later. -When?

536
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:37,010
- 什么?  - 什么时候再见?
-What? -When will I see you?

537
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,070
我不知道 珠儿 这只是种说法
I don't know, Pearl. It's just an expression.

538
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:39,438
你不会带我去欧洲了 是吗?
You're not going to take me to Europe, are you?

539
00:59:39,479 --> 00:59:40,479
跟我讲实话
Tell me the truth.

540
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:44,448
我做错什么了?
What did I do wrong?

541
00:59:44,479 --> 00:59:45,648
- 没什么 冷静点  - 不!
- Nothing. Calm down. - No!

542
00:59:45,678 --> 00:59:48,418
我没做错的话 你为什么要离开我?
Why are you leaving me if I didn't do anything wrong?

543
00:59:48,448 --> 00:59:50,489
我不明白 我以为你喜欢我
I don't understand! I thought you liked me!

544
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,620
- 我确实喜欢你 只是...  - 那就告诉我实话!
-I do like you. I just... -Tell me the truth!

545
00:59:53,658 --> 00:59:55,188
你为什么要离开? 你看到什么了?
Why are you leaving me? What did you see?

546
00:59:55,229 --> 00:59:56,290
你为什么变了?
Why did you change?

547
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:58,158
你吓到我了 珠儿
You're scaring me, Pearl.

548
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:00,458
好吗?
Okay?

549
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:05,168
我希望你的选拔能够顺利
I wish you the best of luck with your audition.

550
01:00:05,198 --> 01:00:06,398
真心的
Sincerely.

551
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:31,360
你不能把我扔在这!
You're not gonna leave me here!

552
01:00:31,388 --> 01:00:34,300
我不要再待在这个农场了!
I'm not staying on this farm!

553
01:00:37,168 --> 01:00:40,069
什么都不能把我困在这!
Nothing's going to keep me here!

554
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:51,110
你听到了吗?
You hear me?

555
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:54,218
什么都不行!
Nothing!

556
01:00:57,418 --> 01:00:59,759
你不行! 霍华德也不行!
Not you! Not Howard!

557
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:02,590
妈妈也不行! 谁都不行!
Not Mama! Nobody!

558
01:01:11,198 --> 01:01:12,739
不 不
No. No.

559
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,520
我要你记住这是什么感觉
I want you to remember what it feels like.

560
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,229
因为这就是每次你看向我时 我的感觉
'Cause that's how I felt every time you looked at me.

561
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:48,638
好了 爹地
Okay, Daddy.

562
01:01:48,668 --> 01:01:50,310
赶紧给你清理干净
Let's get you cleaned up.

563
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:23,608
我希望你别再那样看我
I wish you wouldn't look at me like that.

564
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:58,708
你觉得如何
What do you think?

565
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:31,270
谢谢你做的一切
Thank you for everything.

566
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:35,610
我知道你会在上天自豪地看着我的
I know you'll look down on me proudly.

567
01:03:43,188 --> 01:03:44,718
我是爱你的
You are loved.

568
01:04:05,678 --> 01:04:08,610
永别了 可怜的强尼
Au revoir, poor Johnny!

569
01:04:50,389 --> 01:04:52,620
谢天谢地你来了
Oh, thank goodness you came.

570
01:04:52,658 --> 01:04:54,560
我还以为你不会露面了
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.

571
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:56,290
抱歉
Sorry.

572
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:58,489
家里有些杂事需要处理
I had some chores to do around the house.

573
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:01,229
我自己一人快要紧张坏了
Well, I've been in such a flap all by myself.

574
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:02,770
我的感觉比我想象中
I feel worse than I imagine I would

575
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,898
得流感的感觉还要糟糕
had I contracted that awful flu.

576
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,468
箱子里是什么?
What's in the suitcases?

577
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,708
是我一路上需要带的行李
All my things I need for going on the road.

578
01:05:10,739 --> 01:05:12,938
哇 你可真有信心
Wow. You're confident.

579
01:05:14,878 --> 01:05:18,448
传言说他们每个镇子只选一个姑娘
Rumor has it they may only be taking one gal per town.

580
01:05:20,479 --> 01:05:21,750
必须得选我
It has to be me.

581
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:28,489
这话你不该大声讲出来的 珠儿
I don't think you meant to say that out loud, Pearl.

582
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:31,530
如果我不是我 那我希望是你 好吗?
Well, if it's not me, then I hope it's you, right?

583
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:33,560
必须得选我
It has to be me.

584
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:40,000
下一位
Next.

585
01:05:52,678 --> 01:05:54,320
那是多萝西·柯林斯
That's Dorothy Collins.

586
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,759
真没法为她悲伤
Can't say I'm too saddened for her.

587
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:03,358
有些人就以为自己是天赐瑰宝
Some people just think they're God's gift, you know?

588
01:06:03,389 --> 01:06:06,000
但他们最后总是难逃命运
But they always get what's coming to them eventually.

589
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:11,570
说实话 这么讲话不太好
I feel bad saying that, actually.

590
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,668
她是个护士
She's a nurse.

591
01:06:13,698 --> 01:06:16,040
我真想不出要怎么做护士的工作
I don't know how to do something like that.

592
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:18,468
珠儿 我太紧张了
Oh, Pearl. I'm so nervous.

593
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:20,378
如果刚一上台就笑话我怎么办
What if they laugh me right off stage?

594
01:06:20,408 --> 01:06:22,010
那样我可接受不了
I don't think I could handle that.

595
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,049
你怎么都不害怕的?
How are you not scared?

596
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,948
我想可能是习惯了一直害怕吧
I guess I'm just more used to the feeling.

597
01:06:36,628 --> 01:06:37,790
下一位
Next.

598
01:06:53,908 --> 01:06:55,438
天啊
Oh, Lord.

599
01:07:04,448 --> 01:07:06,389
跟我换位置吧
Switch places with me.

600
01:07:06,418 --> 01:07:08,520
我可能做不到了 我太紧张
I don't think I can do this. I'm too frightened.

601
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,458
- 什么?  - 来吧 珠儿
-What? -Come on, Pearl.

602
01:07:10,489 --> 01:07:12,958
趁他们开门之前换个位置
Switch before they open the doors again.

603
01:07:13,928 --> 01:07:16,370
来吧 过去
Come on. Move.

604
01:07:20,968 --> 01:07:22,810
谢谢你
Thank you.

605
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:25,340
你是个好朋友
You're a good friend.

606
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:31,648
我是吗?
Am I?

607
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:35,378
当然了
Of course you are.

608
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,989
亲家姐妹就得抱团 对吧?
Sister-in-laws have to stick together, right?

609
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:13,658
下一位
Next.

610
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,430
到你了 珠儿
Your turn, Pearl.

611
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:18,857
是时候展现你的本事了
Time to show them what you can do.

612
01:08:18,898 --> 01:08:20,528
我会让他们见识的
I'm gonna show them all.

613
01:08:21,229 --> 01:08:22,700
祝你好运
Break a leg.

614
01:09:25,898 --> 01:09:27,229
准备好了吗 小姐?
Ready, miss?

615
01:11:25,418 --> 01:11:26,918
谢谢你
Thank you.

616
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:30,250
但很遗憾你不行
But it's gonna be a no.

617
01:11:45,938 --> 01:11:48,208
什么?
Pardon?

618
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:51,168
抱歉 你不是我们想找的人
Sorry, you're just not what we had in mind.

619
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:02,818
可那是我跳过最棒的一支舞
Well, that was the best dancing I've ever done.

620
01:12:04,219 --> 01:12:07,290
是的 跳得挺好
Yes, it was very nice.

621
01:12:07,318 --> 01:12:10,990
但是舞团里已经有很多像你一样的姑娘了
But we already have plenty of gals like you in the troupe.

622
01:12:11,029 --> 01:12:13,958
我们今天想找个不一样的人
We're looking for something different today.

623
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,438
懂吗 更"全美明星"一点
You know? More all-American,

624
01:12:18,469 --> 01:12:20,168
更年轻 金发的
younger and blonde.

625
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:23,708
带有明星潜质的
Someone with X factor.

626
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:28,349
什么?
What?

627
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,219

来吧
Come on.

629
01:12:40,358 --> 01:12:41,719
- 来吧  - 不
-Come on. -No.

630
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:45,458
恐怕不行
I'm afraid so.

631
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:48,000
来吧 小姐 该走了
Come on, miss. Time to go.

632
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,140
求求你们
Please.

633
01:12:55,168 --> 01:12:57,269
你们不明白 我需要这个机会
You don't understand. I need this.

634
01:12:57,310 --> 01:13:00,740
下一位 谢谢
Next in line, please.

635
01:13:00,779 --> 01:13:02,250
我可以做得更好
I can make it better.

636
01:13:02,279 --> 01:13:03,378
来吧 亲爱的
Come on now, darling.

637
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:06,317
别闹得没法收场了
You don't want to make a scene and spoil everything.

638
01:13:06,350 --> 01:13:09,318
拜托了 再给我一次机会
Please! Just give me one more chance.

639
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:12,290
- 来吧  - 不要
-Come on, now. -No.

640
01:13:13,219 --> 01:13:14,790
我是...我是明星
I'm a... I'm a star.

641
01:13:16,029 --> 01:13:18,857
来吧 小姐 很遗憾
Come on. Come on, miss. I'm sorry.

642
01:13:18,898 --> 01:13:21,128
- 该走了  - 我是个明星!
-It's time to go. -No, I'm a star!

643
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,229
来吧
Come on.

644
01:13:24,068 --> 01:13:28,740
拜托 我是个明星!
Please! I'm a star!

645
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:30,410
很遗憾 该走了
I'm sorry. It's time to go.

646
01:13:30,438 --> 01:13:32,838
拜托 有人帮帮我吗!
Please, somebody help me!

647
01:13:32,878 --> 01:13:36,378
拜托! 救救我!
Please! Help me! Help me!

648
01:13:37,979 --> 01:13:39,719
不!
No!

649
01:14:17,490 --> 01:14:18,790
珠儿?
Pearl?

650
01:14:21,219 --> 01:14:22,358
珠儿?
Pearl?

651
01:14:27,128 --> 01:14:28,898
我带你回家吧?
How about I take you home?

652
01:14:58,529 --> 01:15:00,160
那是我们送的猪吗?
Is that our pig?

653
01:15:18,878 --> 01:15:20,378
要我去找你妈妈来吗?
Should I go and fetch your mother?

654
01:15:21,918 --> 01:15:23,349
不了
No.

655
01:15:29,588 --> 01:15:32,160
不如我给你弄点好喝的吧?
How about I get you something nice to drink?

656
01:15:35,128 --> 01:15:36,500
妈妈是对的
Mama was right.

657
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,870
我永远没法离开这个农场了
I'm never getting off this farm.

658
01:15:42,008 --> 01:15:43,370
那你离开又想去哪呢?
And where would you want to go?

659
01:15:44,668 --> 01:15:46,508
-  去欧洲  - 欧洲?
-Europe. -Europe?

660
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:49,008
那是为什么?
What on earth for?

661
01:15:49,048 --> 01:15:50,180
欧洲遍地废墟了
It'll be in ruins

662
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:52,519
霍华德绝对不肯回去那边的
and you'll never get Howard back there, I'll tell you.

663
01:15:55,088 --> 01:15:56,450
别这样嘛
Oh, come on, now.

664
01:15:56,490 --> 01:15:57,450
我知道你很失望
I know you're disappointed,

665
01:15:57,490 --> 01:16:00,120
但是没必要这么难过
but there's no sense in taking it this hard.

666
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:02,430
不过是个教堂的舞团而已
It's just a lousy old church group.

667
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:04,958
都是些外行
Those old dolts,

668
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:09,099
他们根本不懂什么是专业的舞蹈
they don't know the first thing about quality dancing.

669
01:16:10,168 --> 01:16:12,200
你不明白
You don't understand.

670
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:13,599
不明白什么?
What don't I?

671
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:15,410
说吧 珠儿
Come on, Pearl.

672
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:17,438
到底怎么回事?
What's really the matter?

673
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,410
我感觉
I don't feel

674
01:16:23,708 --> 01:16:25,080
很不好
well.

675
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:29,647
你不是染上什么病了吧?
You're not coming down with something, are you?

676
01:16:29,688 --> 01:16:31,219
没有
No.

677
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:32,490
不是那样的事
It's nothing like that.

678
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,088
谢天谢地
Oh, thank goodness.

679
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,430
如果我偷偷溜走
If I snuck out of the house

680
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:38,330
结果带了一身病菌回到家
and ended up bringing home nothing but the germ,

681
01:16:38,358 --> 01:16:41,128
我爸爸妈妈会杀了我的
my mother and father would just kill me.

682
01:16:43,229 --> 01:16:45,100
我担心可能我身上可能
I'm worried there may be something

683
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:47,068
有什么严重的毛病 米斯蒂
real wrong with me, Mitsy.

684
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:50,310
你是什么意思?
How do you mean?

685
01:16:51,508 --> 01:16:54,008
就好像我身上缺了点什么
Seems like there's something missing in me

686
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,080
别的所有人都有的东西
that the rest of the world has.

687
01:16:57,608 --> 01:16:59,120
你跟霍华德讲过吗?
Have you told Howard?

688
01:17:00,979 --> 01:17:04,719
我从来没跟任何人讲出来过
I've never spoken about it out loud to anyone.

689
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:07,660
我很怕人们会怎么想
So afraid of what people might think.

690
01:17:07,688 --> 01:17:09,060
珠儿
Pearl...

691
01:17:10,529 --> 01:17:12,429
霍华德是你的丈夫
Howard's your husband.

692
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:15,469
他喜欢你
He adores you.

693
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:18,168
你不该害怕告诉他你的感受
You shouldn't be afraid to tell him how you feel.

694
01:17:19,438 --> 01:17:22,008
我害怕我可能说的话
I'm scared of what I might say.

695
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,410
那就先对我练习一下
Well, practice on me first, then.

696
01:17:25,108 --> 01:17:26,580
假装我就是霍华德
Pretend I'm Howard,

697
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:29,410
说出你心里任何想说的
and you just say whatever's on your mind.

698
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:31,349
- 我说不出  - 你当然可以
-I can't. -Yes, you can.

699
01:17:32,418 --> 01:17:33,479
来吧 都讲出来
Go on. Get it all out.

700
01:17:35,318 --> 01:17:37,548
- 真的?  - 没错
-Really? -Yes.

701
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:39,290
相信我
Trust me.

702
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,068
霍华德...
Howard...

703
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:00,740
讲出来 珠儿
Go ahead, Pearl.

704
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:10,219
我真恨你把我丢在这里
I hate you so much for leaving me here,

705
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:12,188
有时我希望你死了
sometimes I hope you die.

706
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:17,729
抱歉
I'm sorry.

707
01:18:17,758 --> 01:18:20,729
承认这一点让我感觉很糟糕 但这是事实
I feel awful admitting that, but it's the truth.

708
01:18:23,729 --> 01:18:25,100
我对其他男人
I was curious

709
01:18:26,398 --> 01:18:27,600
感到好奇
about other men.

710
01:18:29,469 --> 01:18:31,108
我敢说你不想听说
I'm sure you don't want to hear about

711
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:32,740
有陌生人来满足你的妻子
a stranger satisfying your wife,

712
01:18:32,779 --> 01:18:34,679
我发誓只有那一次
and I swear it was only once.

713
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:37,279
那是个错误
It was a mistake.

714
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:40,279
他并不是我想要的 我现在明白了
It wasn't him that I wanted. I know that now.

715
01:18:40,318 --> 01:18:42,048
我希望一切能够回到
And I wish things could just go back

716
01:18:42,088 --> 01:18:43,490
以前的样子
to the way they were before,

717
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,358
但我想不出要怎么回去
but I don't see how they could,

718
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:49,258
我所做的事无法挽回
not after the things I've done.

719
01:18:52,858 --> 01:18:55,469
你还做了什么事 珠儿?
What else have you done, Pearl?

720
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,469
噢 霍华德
Oh, Howard.

721
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,798
我才发现这些听起来是什么样
I realize how this all must sound.

722
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:03,370
说真的 有段时间我受宠若惊
Honestly, there was a time I was flattered

723
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:06,378
能有你这样英俊的人青睐我
to have someone as handsome as you pine over me.

724
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:08,548
你真是个好人 我知道的
You're such a good person. I know that.

725
01:19:09,850 --> 01:19:12,779
我一直注意留心你的心思
I made sure to always be mindful with your heart.

726
01:19:12,818 --> 01:19:15,318
我绝不希望你感到嫉妒
I never wanted you to feel jealous.

727
01:19:16,648 --> 01:19:18,790
这是种可怕的感受 像溃烂
It's an awful feeling like a rot,

728
01:19:18,818 --> 01:19:22,729
会在你的内心扭曲翻腾
the way it just twists and turns at your insides.

729
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,830
我太了解那种痛楚了
I know that aching so well.

730
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:27,660
我能感觉到
I feel it.

731
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:31,229
每次看到别人顺风顺水都是
Whenever I see others whose lives come easy

732
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,508
因为事实上 我不是个好人
because the truth is, I'm not really a good person.

733
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:37,979
珠儿 我觉得我该...
Pearl, I think I should just...

734
01:19:38,008 --> 01:19:40,708
我从不打量其他男人的原因
The reason I kept my eyes to the ground around other men

735
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:42,508
从来不是不想伤害你
was never to avoid hurting you.

736
01:19:44,608 --> 01:19:46,779
而是我明白我有多幸运
It's because I understood how lucky I was

737
01:19:46,818 --> 01:19:49,188
能够得到你的关注
to have your attention.

738
01:19:49,219 --> 01:19:52,758
我也许是个可怜的农场姑娘 但我并不笨
I may be a poor farm girl, Howard, but I'm not stupid.

739
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:56,458
你来到我家农场的第一天我就注意到了
I spotted you the moment you came to live with us.

740
01:19:56,490 --> 01:19:58,599
你像其他农工一样努力
You worked hard like the other farmhands,

741
01:19:58,628 --> 01:20:00,357
但你不一样
but you were different.

742
01:20:00,398 --> 01:20:02,430
你是有背景的
You're from somewhere.

743
01:20:02,469 --> 01:20:04,200
来自美好 安逸的地方
A nice, comfortable place

744
01:20:04,229 --> 01:20:06,600
你随时想回都可以回去
that you could return to whenever you wanted.

745
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:11,208
我真渴望能那样
I'm so desperate to have that.

746
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:15,310
我的一辈子 都想离开这个农场
All my life, I've wanted off this farm

747
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:17,279
而你就是我离开的机会
and you were my ticket out.

748
01:20:18,548 --> 01:20:20,148
所以...
So...

749
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:23,548
我决定永远不能让你看到我真实的一面
I made sure to never let you see who I really was.

750
01:20:23,588 --> 01:20:26,160
这一招非常好用
It worked like a charm, too.

751
01:20:26,188 --> 01:20:28,560
后来你终于把我带回去
Then when you finally brought me back

752
01:20:28,588 --> 01:20:30,358
回了老家见了你的家人
to your home to meet your family,

753
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:31,830
就像我希望的一样
it was just as I hoped.

754
01:20:33,628 --> 01:20:35,700
仿佛是画里走出来的生活
A life straight out of the pictures.

755
01:20:37,568 --> 01:20:39,700
至少给我的感觉是这样的
At least that's what it felt like to me.

756
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:43,508
而你却不想要
And you didn't want it.

757
01:20:46,838 --> 01:20:48,608
你只想留在这里 在我们的农场
You just wanted to stay here on our farm,

758
01:20:48,648 --> 01:20:50,479
而这真的让我好愤怒
and that made me so angry.

759
01:20:51,608 --> 01:20:52,950
你怎么可以这样?
How could you?

760
01:20:52,979 --> 01:20:56,188
我确信你知道我讨厌这 你一定是的
I'm certain you knew I hated it, you must've.

761
01:20:56,219 --> 01:20:58,290
你怎么可以如此自私 而残忍
How could you be so selfish and cruel

762
01:20:58,318 --> 01:21:00,358
而我如此努力让你感到幸福?
after all I've done to make you happy?

763
01:21:05,729 --> 01:21:08,430
我甚至怀上了你的孩子
I was even pregnant with your baby.

764
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:16,567
我从来都不想做一名母亲
I never wanted to be a mother.

765
01:21:16,608 --> 01:21:20,279
我憎恶有东西在我体内生长的感觉
I loathed the feeling of it growing inside me.

766
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:21,878
那感觉像病症
It felt like sickness.

767
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:27,849
拉扯着 吮吸着我 像谷仓里粘人的牲口
Pulling and sucking on me like some needy animal in a barn.

768
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:31,890
我怎么能为另一个生命负责?
How could I be responsible for another life?

769
01:21:32,858 --> 01:21:34,758
生命让我害怕
Life terrifies me.

770
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:37,628
严酷 惨淡 又让人耗尽精力
It's harsh, and bleak, and draining.

771
01:21:39,898 --> 01:21:42,370
当胎儿死去时我大松一口气
I was so relieved when it died.

772
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:44,330
把我困在这里的负担又少了一点
It was one less weight keeping me trapped here,

773
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:46,798
但战争开始了 你也离开了我
but then the war came and you left me, too.

774
01:21:47,810 --> 01:21:49,938
你为什么离开我 霍华德?
Why did you leave me, Howard?

775
01:21:56,508 --> 01:21:58,350
我讨厌这样的感觉
I hate feeling like this.

776
01:21:58,918 --> 01:22:01,317
如此可悲
So pathetic.

777
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:03,719
你们那样的人会有这种感觉吗?
Do people like you ever feel this way?

778
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:05,588
我猜你不会有
I figure you don't.

779
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:07,758
你看起来时刻都很完美
You seem so perfect all the time.

780
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:10,430
上帝一定对你非常慷慨
Lord must've been generous to you.

781
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:12,857
他从未回应过我的祈祷
He never answers any of my prayers.

782
01:22:12,898 --> 01:22:15,398
我也不知道为什么 我做错了什么?
I don't know why. What did I do?

783
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:17,500
我到底有什么毛病?
What is wrong with me?

784
01:22:17,529 --> 01:22:19,740
求求你告诉我 没准我能有所好转
Please, just tell me so maybe I can get better.

785
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:21,338
我不想沦落成我妈妈
I don't want to end up like Mama.

786
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:23,040
我想要在大银幕上跳舞
I want to be dancing up on the screen

787
01:22:23,068 --> 01:22:25,270
像电影里的漂亮姑娘
like the pretty gals in the pictures.

788
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:29,310
我真的好想像她们一样
I want what they have so badly,

789
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:30,878
完美无瑕
to be perfect,

790
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:33,580
被许许多多的人爱着
to be loved from as many people as possible

791
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:36,349
能够补偿我受折磨的那些时间
to make up for all my time spent suffering.

792
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:41,020
有时我在半夜醒过来
Sometimes I wake in the middle of the night

793
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:43,990
那种恐惧席卷着我 如果命该如此呢?
and the fear washes over me, 'cause what if this is it?

794
01:22:46,358 --> 01:22:48,000
如果我只属于这里怎么办?
What if this is right where I belong?

795
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:54,910
我是个失败者
I'm a failure.

796
01:22:56,338 --> 01:22:57,469
我不漂亮
I'm not pretty

797
01:22:58,979 --> 01:23:01,410
本性也不快乐或随和
or naturally pleasant, or friendly.

798
01:23:02,008 --> 01:23:03,479
我不聪明
I'm not smart,

799
01:23:04,108 --> 01:23:05,918
也不风趣 也不自信
or funny, or confident.

800
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:10,750
我正是妈妈口中的样子 懦弱
I'm exactly what Mama said I was, weak.

801
01:23:12,088 --> 01:23:14,490
我不知道为什么 我做了什么?
I don't know why. What did I do?

802
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:16,358
为什么我的家庭不能像你一样?
Why wasn't my family like yours?

803
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:19,430
我真讨厌不能做你 只能做自己的感觉
I hate what it feels like to be me and not you.

804
01:23:19,458 --> 01:23:21,397
我真害怕当你回家之后
I'm so scared that when you finally come home,

805
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:22,700
你会看透我 然后害怕我
you'll see me and be frightened

806
01:23:22,729 --> 01:23:24,469
就像其他人一样
like everyone else is.

807
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:29,769
我知道我做过什么
I know what I've done,

808
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:31,008
那些坏事
the bad things,

809
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:36,450
糟糕的 令人发指的事情
terrible, awful, murderous things.

810
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:38,918
我现在很后悔 但我喜欢那种感觉
I regret them now, but I liked how they felt.

811
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:40,779
我不希望这样 但我确实喜欢
I wish I didn't, but I did.

812
01:23:42,588 --> 01:23:45,719
起初只是比我更小的动物
At first, it was only animals smaller than myself.

813
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:47,758
没什么灵性的动物
Nothing with feelings.

814
01:23:47,790 --> 01:23:49,358
没法反抗伤到我的动物
Nothing that could hurt me back.

815
01:23:50,588 --> 01:23:51,688
感觉很好
It felt good.

816
01:23:52,758 --> 01:23:54,560
杀戮比你想象得要简单
Killing's easier than you think,

817
01:23:55,969 --> 01:23:57,398
直到最近对妈妈
till recently with Mama

818
01:23:57,430 --> 01:23:58,838
还有电影院的那个男孩
and the boy from the picture house.

819
01:23:58,870 --> 01:23:59,938
他们感觉不一样
They were different.

820
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:02,567
他们有着更大的意义
They were more meaningful.

821
01:24:02,608 --> 01:24:04,438
我伤害他们 是为了让他们知道
I hurt them so they too might know

822
01:24:04,469 --> 01:24:05,580
受折磨是什么感觉
what it feels like to suffer,

823
01:24:05,608 --> 01:24:07,080
但可怜的爹地命不该这样
but poor Daddy didn't deserve that.

824
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:09,378
我真后悔自己做的事
I wish I hadn't done what I did.

825
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:13,520
妈妈本意是好的
Mama meant well.

826
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:16,950
她一生过得很苦
She had a hard life.

827
01:24:16,990 --> 01:24:18,790
她只想要个有安全感的家
She only wanted a home to feel safe in.

828
01:24:18,818 --> 01:24:19,918
我能明白
I can see that.

829
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:21,858
我以为我恨她
I thought I hated her,

830
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:23,660
但我也是在寻求安全感罢了
but I just want to feel safe, too.

831
01:24:28,628 --> 01:24:29,700
天啊
Lord...

832
01:24:30,969 --> 01:24:33,838
我真是搞了一团糟
I made such a mess of things.

833
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,108
我不知道我还能承受多少
I don't know how much more I can take.

834
01:24:38,979 --> 01:24:40,479
我得打理好这一切
I need to clean this up.

835
01:24:41,608 --> 01:24:43,850
所有事情
All of it.

836
01:24:43,878 --> 01:24:46,817
我得在你下次见到我前处理好
I need to make things right before you see me again.

837
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,148
也许我能让这个农场
Maybe if I can turn this farm

838
01:24:50,188 --> 01:24:51,918
成为你想要的 我们的家
into a home for us like you wanted,

839
01:24:51,958 --> 01:24:53,790
一切终于能发生改变
things will finally be different.

840
01:24:53,818 --> 01:24:56,560
我能原谅
I can forgive.

841
01:24:57,458 --> 01:24:59,059
我可以成为你想要的样子
I can be who you want me to be

842
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:01,660
只要你能留在我身边
if you'll just stay with me.

843
01:25:03,068 --> 01:25:04,798
你愿意吗 求求你?
Would you do that, please?

844
01:25:07,668 --> 01:25:09,639
我不能再独自一人了
I can't be all by myself anymore.

845
01:25:09,668 --> 01:25:10,740
这太难了
It's too hard.

846
01:25:15,208 --> 01:25:17,048
我们可以爱着对方
We can love each other.

847
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:19,019
我愿意为你这样
I'll do that for you

848
01:25:19,048 --> 01:25:22,188
如果你是认真发誓"直至死亡将我们分离"
if you really meant all that "till death do us part."

849
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:25,719
那就够了
It'd be enough,

850
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:30,588
这个农场 只有你和我
just you and me here on this farm.

851
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,567
我只希望有人爱我
All I really want is to be loved.

852
01:25:43,208 --> 01:25:45,910
最近我真的过得很难
I'm having such a hard time without it lately.

853
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:25,608
我应该走了
I should probably get going now.

854
01:26:25,648 --> 01:26:28,648
再不回家 妈妈会开始担心我在哪的
Mother will be wondering where I am if I'm not home soon.

855
01:26:37,588 --> 01:26:39,059
你害怕我吗?
Are you frightened of me?

856
01:26:41,128 --> 01:26:42,128
不
No.

857
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:46,600

不会
No.

什么?
What?

863
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:09,790
能够被选中
For getting the part

864
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:12,958
参加舞团 你实至名归
in the dance troupe. You deserved it.

865
01:27:15,128 --> 01:27:17,898
- 我没有被选中  - 没关系的
-I didn't get the part. -It's okay.

866
01:27:19,068 --> 01:27:20,298
你不需要假装了
You don't have to pretend anymore.

867
01:27:20,338 --> 01:27:21,910
不会伤到我的感情的
My feelings won't be hurt.

868
01:27:23,310 --> 01:27:25,540
如果不是我 我会高兴是你的 对吧?
If it wasn't me, I'm glad it was you, right?

869
01:27:28,779 --> 01:27:30,849
- 但是 珠儿 我...  - 拜托了
-But, Pearl, I... -Please...

870
01:27:32,318 --> 01:27:33,719
别向我撒谎
Don't lie to me.

871
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:43,229
好吧 确实
Well, yes.

872
01:27:45,798 --> 01:27:46,958
谢谢你
Thank you.

873
01:27:49,969 --> 01:27:51,870
这一定会非常棒
It's going to be real swell,

874
01:27:52,938 --> 01:27:54,938
能在全国到处跳舞
dancing around the state.

875
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:01,740
我希望你到时候能来看演出

不会
No.

881
