1
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,636
-Hello?
-Sonny, it's your dad You asleep?

2
00:00:40,895 --> 00:00:43,896
No. Hey, man. I was exercising.

3
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,597
-Bullshit You were sleeping
-I wasn't.

4
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:50,228
This kid won't stop lying to me
You still act like you're six

5
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:53,821
Yeah, okay, Dad
I act like I'm six

6
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:57,863
Found a job yet, where
you work more than one day a week?

7
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,365
I've been looking

8
00:01:00,206 --> 00:01:01,321
Looking won't pay the rent

9
00:01:01,582 --> 00:01:03,990
All the money I won
from the cab accident

10
00:01:04,252 --> 00:01:06,659
is kicking ass
in the stock market, so relax

11
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:09,494
-Don't blow it on worthless crap
-I won't

12
00:01:11,217 --> 00:01:13,790
You should spend it on your bar exam

13
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:16,722
You're the lawyer
I ain't taking a bar exam

14
00:01:16,973 --> 00:01:18,930
I got too much other shit going on

15
00:01:20,184 --> 00:01:22,391
I don't know what happened to you

16
00:01:22,645 --> 00:01:25,681
How're things going with
your girlfriend, Vanessa?

17
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,138
Things are going fine.

18
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:28,722
Shit!

19
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:29,975
I gotta go.

20
00:01:30,236 --> 00:01:32,857
Shit! You turned off
the alarm clock again.

21
00:01:33,114 --> 00:01:36,981
No! I mean, yes, I did,
but I thought you needed more sleep.

22
00:01:37,243 --> 00:01:40,694
I shouldn't have stayed here.
That was a jerk thing to do.

23
00:01:40,955 --> 00:01:43,528
Why are you going to work?
It's Sunday.

24
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:47,540
I'm not going to work. I'm going to
brunch with potential clients.

25
00:01:47,795 --> 00:01:51,378
That's how a party planner
gets business, by making contacts.

26
00:01:51,632 --> 00:01:54,882
Meet with me. I'll order in
from Cozy's. We'll have fun.

27
00:01:55,136 --> 00:01:58,884
I am sick of Cozy's.
You order in from there all the time.

28
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,717
The delivery guy's your best friend.

29
00:02:00,975 --> 00:02:03,133
He happens to be pretty damn nice.

30
00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:05,185
This is a rough patch in my life.

31
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:08,973
Syracuse is 0 and 3.
And I got those medical problems.

32
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:10,264
Medical problems?

33
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:14,144
A cab runs over your foot two years ago.
You're hospitalized one night.

34
00:02:14,405 --> 00:02:16,279
First of all, that cab was huge.

35
00:02:16,532 --> 00:02:20,612
And a jury decided that one night
of pain was worth $200,000.

36
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,779
-So there you go.
-Whatever.

37
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,281
Why are you being
so nuts to me lately?

38
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:28,371
You refuse to move on
to the next phase.

39
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:30,461
I'd like to have a family someday.

40
00:02:30,713 --> 00:02:33,382
I need someone I can rely on,
not a playmate.

41
00:02:33,758 --> 00:02:36,924
You need a father figure?
"Stop pulling your sister's hair!"

42
00:02:37,553 --> 00:02:40,839
You know what? I'm gonna go to
Syracuse to see my mom.

43
00:02:41,974 --> 00:02:44,845
-I'll be back on Wednesday.
-What are you talking about?

44
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,025
I had call for delivery, but it was
crank call. You want chocolate cake?

45
00:02:52,276 --> 00:02:54,814
Come back later.
I'll lndian wrestle you.

46
00:02:55,071 --> 00:02:56,316
You're going down, sucker.

47
00:02:56,572 --> 00:02:57,603
We'll see about that.

48
00:02:57,865 --> 00:02:59,988
Okay. Peace, out.

49
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:02,153
You're going to Syracuse?

50
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:04,238
I need time to think and so do you.

51
00:03:04,497 --> 00:03:05,528
Think about what?

52
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,411
Your life and why I should
be a part of it.

53
00:03:08,626 --> 00:03:09,456
All right.

54
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,996
While you're at it,
think about getting a real job.

55
00:03:13,256 --> 00:03:15,213
I got a real job!

56
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:23,924
Patrick Ewing, nice shot.

57
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:27,347
-Hey, Sonny.
-What's up, buddy boy?

58
00:03:27,603 --> 00:03:29,679
I'm out the door. Hey, pal.

59
00:03:30,773 --> 00:03:32,433
-Where you going?
-Manhattan.

60
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:34,234
You wanna take me with you?

61
00:03:34,485 --> 00:03:36,644
All right, I guess.

62
00:03:36,904 --> 00:03:38,696
Hold onto your money.
Later on.

63
00:03:38,948 --> 00:03:40,442
Okay, take care, Sonny.

64
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:42,113
See you.

65
00:03:42,577 --> 00:03:44,534
Cadillac, I love it.

66
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:06,182
Surprise!

67
00:04:06,434 --> 00:04:08,142
Just ignore him.

68
00:04:08,644 --> 00:04:11,314
It's only Sonny. It's only Sonny.

69
00:04:11,564 --> 00:04:13,936
Yeah, it's only me. It's only me.

70
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,651
-What's going on?
-Corinne's going-away party for Kevin.

71
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:20,739
She didn't tell me.
The roommate has a right to know.

72
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,196
She knew you'd ruin the surprise.

73
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:24,482
No, I wouldn't.

74
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,159
Hey, surprise.

75
00:04:28,623 --> 00:04:29,654
Surprise.

76
00:04:32,168 --> 00:04:33,199
What's going on?

77
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,167
We wasted the good surprise on you.

78
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:40,623
All right.

79
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:49,299
Is this your handiwork?

80
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,185
I guess.

81
00:04:51,646 --> 00:04:53,306
See you in three hours.

82
00:04:53,564 --> 00:04:55,972
Good to see you stiffs.
What've you been doing?

83
00:04:56,234 --> 00:05:00,018
Last three weeks have been crazy.
I've been in Denver, Dallas--

84
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:03,980
I'm sleeping in the office.
We're going to trial on the fraud case.

85
00:05:04,242 --> 00:05:07,196
Honey, it was a great surprise.
I was totally shocked.

86
00:05:07,453 --> 00:05:10,822
No, you weren't!
And I worked so hard on this.

87
00:05:11,082 --> 00:05:12,410
Need some help?

88
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:14,955
-Honey, your sister's here.
-Hey, sweetie.

89
00:05:15,211 --> 00:05:17,120
I hate Sonny.

90
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,080
My client's out $7 million. All we
can sue on is breach of contract.

91
00:05:21,342 --> 00:05:24,711
Maybe you can sue under
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

92
00:05:25,346 --> 00:05:28,133
I gotta get back to the office.
You're the king.

93
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:29,849
Mikey, a pleasure.

94
00:05:30,184 --> 00:05:32,307
-I'll see you at home.
-All right.

95
00:05:34,772 --> 00:05:36,053
I'll walk you out.

96
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,104
I gotta admit, I'm still
weirded out when they kiss.

97
00:05:41,362 --> 00:05:43,900
Why? They're gay.
That's what gay guys do.

98
00:05:44,156 --> 00:05:47,857
I know, but they were like
brothers to us back in school.

99
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:51,488
They're still like our brothers.
Our very, very gay brothers.

100
00:05:52,623 --> 00:05:55,660
What are you doing after this?
Going to a Klan meeting?

101
00:05:56,711 --> 00:06:00,495
Remember when Dad had that barbecue
for his friends and it rained...

102
00:06:00,756 --> 00:06:02,963
...so he and Mom went into the
kitchen and made...

103
00:06:03,217 --> 00:06:06,302
...1 00 hamburgers with one frying pan?

104
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:11,805
You're not gonna let a little rain
stop you from making 1 00 hamburgers.

105
00:06:25,531 --> 00:06:28,236
That relationship's lasted longer
than I thought it would.

106
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:31,779
Look at his eyes. He's bored.
I give it two more weeks.

107
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:34,410
Hey, excuse me. Everybody!

108
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:38,327
I'm sorry. I wanted to thank you
for coming tonight.

109
00:06:38,586 --> 00:06:39,961
I guess I should say--

110
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:43,837
I'm getting it.

111
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:48,588
Tomorrow I'm leaving for China to
represent the firm of Morton and Mandel.

112
00:06:48,846 --> 00:06:52,678
Me, the same guy who once shaved
his ass to win a $5 bet.

113
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:54,851
Prove it!

114
00:06:57,063 --> 00:06:58,225
Just kidding.

115
00:06:58,564 --> 00:07:01,980
But I am real glad you're all here
tonight, because...

116
00:07:02,235 --> 00:07:05,105
...l'm gonna do what I never thought
I'd have the guts to do.

117
00:07:05,863 --> 00:07:07,441
You're not proposing, are you?

118
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,240
Yeah, pal, I am.

119
00:07:12,495 --> 00:07:14,571
Well, think about it, you know?

120
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:16,241
God, Sonny, shut up!

121
00:07:20,586 --> 00:07:23,587
Anyway, will you?

122
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,835
Yeah.

123
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:30,171
Good call on the two weeks.

124
00:07:39,856 --> 00:07:41,516
Sonny, what was that all about?

125
00:07:41,774 --> 00:07:45,060
Congratulations. You and
" Big Boobs" McGee are gonna be happy.

126
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,730
Don't call her that.

127
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:51,151
You wanna tell your children you met
their mother as a waitress at Hooters?

128
00:07:51,492 --> 00:07:54,410
Sonny, that was five years ago.
She's a doctor now...

129
00:07:54,662 --> 00:07:56,738
...and my fianc閑, so from now on...

130
00:07:56,998 --> 00:07:58,575
...Dr. Big Boobs McGee.

131
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,122
-Congratulations.
-Thanks, man.

132
00:08:01,377 --> 00:08:03,120
I just...

133
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,588
...got shit going on.

134
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,871
What's the matter?

135
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:09,458
Vanessa's gonna break up with me...

136
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:12,257
...and I don't know how
to make her wanna stay.

137
00:08:12,513 --> 00:08:14,838
She's getting older.
She wants different things:

138
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:18,100
Career, stable relationship, a family.

139
00:08:18,352 --> 00:08:19,467
That's how they get.

140
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:22,599
I want things to go back
to the way they used to be.

141
00:08:22,857 --> 00:08:25,395
When we were at Syracuse,
and Vanessa worshiped you.

142
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:28,189
-That was nice.
-Nobody hassled you to get a job.

143
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:30,237
Tommy and Phil showered separately.

144
00:08:31,657 --> 00:08:32,902
Those were the days.

145
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:35,285
-What're you doing?
-If I make this...

146
00:08:35,536 --> 00:08:37,992
...Vanessa will realize
she likes me the way I am.

147
00:08:38,247 --> 00:08:39,576
You're going to the putt.

148
00:08:39,957 --> 00:08:42,033
Remember, the roof breaks
to the right.

149
00:08:44,337 --> 00:08:46,294
Yes! That's what I'm talk--

150
00:08:46,547 --> 00:08:47,792
Good God!

151
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:49,460
That can't be good.

152
00:08:54,805 --> 00:08:56,004
Where's Kevin?

153
00:08:56,307 --> 00:09:00,305
He already left. I guess
he forgot to say goodbye to you.

154
00:09:00,561 --> 00:09:03,895
-Why are you here?
-I'm cleaning because you're useless.

155
00:09:04,148 --> 00:09:06,770
Then what, you gonna go to
your Hooters reunion?

156
00:09:07,026 --> 00:09:10,525
You guys talk about whose ass
hangs out of their shorts the most?

157
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:13,396
At least I can fit my ass
in my shorts, fatty.

158
00:09:13,783 --> 00:09:15,491
Speaking of fatty, whose is this?

159
00:09:15,743 --> 00:09:18,115
-I don't know.
-I'm eating it then.

160
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,702
"We wasted the good surprise on you."

161
00:09:25,795 --> 00:09:27,586
Lady gave me $5 to bring him here.

162
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,416
-What do you mean?
-Later.

163
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:32,173
Are you selling raffle tickets?

164
00:09:39,392 --> 00:09:40,554
Oh, boy.

165
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:45,934
-Kevin Gerrity.
-I got something to tell you

166
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,020
What's up?

167
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:48,270
There's a kid here.

168
00:09:48,526 --> 00:09:49,557
What kind of kid?

169
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:52,061
If this note is true, it's your kid.

170
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:53,519
What do you mean?

171
00:09:55,283 --> 00:09:57,359
I'm having a tough time
reading this...

172
00:09:57,618 --> 00:10:00,703
...but it says, " Dear Kevin:
This is Julian, your son.

173
00:10:00,955 --> 00:10:03,624
I hope you understand why
I didn't tell you until now...

174
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:07,540
but he needs your help
I can't be his mother anymore "

175
00:10:07,795 --> 00:10:09,539
-This is ridiculous.
-Hang on

176
00:10:10,464 --> 00:10:11,793
Who's this?

177
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,376
This is my friend.

178
00:10:14,802 --> 00:10:18,930
-Is that Kevin on the phone?
-No, it's my Uncle Remus.

179
00:10:21,017 --> 00:10:22,559
What's your name?

180
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:24,175
Is he all right?

181
00:10:24,437 --> 00:10:26,264
He doesn't like you.
Leave us alone.

182
00:10:26,522 --> 00:10:27,851
You're such a dick.

183
00:10:28,107 --> 00:10:31,025
That was your girlfriend.
She was acting " Hooterific."

184
00:10:31,444 --> 00:10:32,855
Who sent that note?

185
00:10:33,112 --> 00:10:33,978
"Jan."

186
00:10:34,238 --> 00:10:37,192
Jan....
I don't know any Jan.

187
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,359
-Where's he from?
-Where are you from?

188
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:40,614
Buffalo.

189
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,909
I've never even been to Buffalo.

190
00:10:43,164 --> 00:10:44,788
Maybe it's a mistake.

191
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,958
Is this like the time
you said my parents were dead?

192
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:49,788
I swear, he's right here.

193
00:10:50,505 --> 00:10:53,256
I'm coming home.
I don't know what I'll say--

194
00:10:53,508 --> 00:10:54,587
Hang on. It says...

195
00:10:54,842 --> 00:10:59,089
..." If you won't take responsibility
for him, they found a foster family--"

196
00:10:59,347 --> 00:11:02,466
Yes, Uncle Remus,
I know the catfish are huge.

197
00:11:02,725 --> 00:11:03,888
That's terrific

198
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,269
Here's a number for a guy...

199
00:11:06,521 --> 00:11:09,225
at City Social Service
Arthur Brooks I'll call

200
00:11:09,482 --> 00:11:11,521
-I'll come home
-I'll take care of it.

201
00:11:11,776 --> 00:11:12,772
Are you sure?

202
00:11:13,027 --> 00:11:14,106
Yeah, don't worry.

203
00:11:15,988 --> 00:11:17,399
Hooters. Hooters. Hooters!

204
00:11:17,657 --> 00:11:19,696
-All right. Thanks a lot.
-Later

205
00:11:22,787 --> 00:11:24,744
I'm gonna make another phone call.

206
00:11:25,164 --> 00:11:27,489
You want to come and sit down, pal?

207
00:11:30,378 --> 00:11:35,040
Or you can stand there.
Anything you want. I'll be a minute.

208
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:40,048
Social Services
is closed today, Columbus Day

209
00:11:40,388 --> 00:11:42,676
We'll be open tomorrow at 8 am

210
00:11:43,182 --> 00:11:45,056
Columbus Day.

211
00:11:47,061 --> 00:11:49,054
Boy, I don't know what to tell you.

212
00:11:49,313 --> 00:11:51,639
Everything's gonna get
figured out tomorrow.

213
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:54,307
Can you be a tough little guy
until then?

214
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:56,309
Great.

215
00:11:57,196 --> 00:12:00,446
Do I need to get you a bottle
of formula or something?

216
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,065
What do you eat?

217
00:12:02,326 --> 00:12:03,655
Food.

218
00:12:03,995 --> 00:12:05,987
Yeah? I eat food too.

219
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,406
What--? Come on.

220
00:12:11,586 --> 00:12:13,210
You need me to hold your hand?

221
00:12:13,462 --> 00:12:17,377
On Mondays, I go to Central Park
and watch rollerbladers fall down.

222
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:19,756
-You into that?
-I don't know.

223
00:12:20,636 --> 00:12:22,344
Watch. This guy's humming.

224
00:12:22,597 --> 00:12:25,716
He's going down, he's going down,
he's going--!

225
00:12:28,186 --> 00:12:29,431
How old are you, anyways?

226
00:12:29,687 --> 00:12:31,146
Five.

227
00:12:32,064 --> 00:12:33,642
You wear a diaper?

228
00:12:36,652 --> 00:12:38,562
You wipe your own ass then?

229
00:12:38,821 --> 00:12:41,110
You do? Good job. That's cool.

230
00:12:41,782 --> 00:12:44,867
Come on, fall down. Fall down. Yes!
Come on, damn it.

231
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:46,744
You suck. You suck!

232
00:12:47,914 --> 00:12:49,324
Check this out.

233
00:13:03,137 --> 00:13:04,216
My God!

234
00:13:04,472 --> 00:13:07,426
There's a stick there.
Somebody should move it.

235
00:13:07,683 --> 00:13:10,768
All right now, what way
would you put that on?

236
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,428
This Columbo, he pretends
to be stupid...

237
00:13:13,731 --> 00:13:15,474
...but he's really smart as a tack.

238
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:16,978
Oh, yeah, he is.

239
00:13:17,235 --> 00:13:21,184
You put the vane on down there
Then this boat comes up

240
00:13:21,447 --> 00:13:23,487
I wipe my own ass.

241
00:13:24,325 --> 00:13:25,736
Me too.

242
00:13:28,162 --> 00:13:31,080
So, Mr. Ass Wiper,
what's this guy's name?

243
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:32,951
Scuba Steve.

244
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:35,285
Does he ever take his flippers off?

245
00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:37,249
What if he goes bowling?

246
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:40,589
They don't make him wear bowling shoes?
He wears flippers?

247
00:13:40,842 --> 00:13:41,672
Really?

248
00:13:41,926 --> 00:13:44,049
I had a doll like that at one time.

249
00:13:44,303 --> 00:13:46,841
But my cat, he bite his head off.

250
00:13:47,098 --> 00:13:48,426
What cat would do that?

251
00:13:48,683 --> 00:13:49,714
You calling me a liar?

252
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:51,684
Hey, take it easy.

253
00:13:53,104 --> 00:13:54,135
Anyways...

254
00:13:54,397 --> 00:13:56,188
...Jets are playing tonight.

255
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,228
We're gonna go to the Blarney Stone.
Wanna come?

256
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:00,979
I've got more deliveries.

257
00:14:01,237 --> 00:14:03,858
Maybe you can also finish
the turkey on your lip.

258
00:14:04,115 --> 00:14:05,313
Right there.

259
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:11,913
Let's crank up the Styx

260
00:14:12,165 --> 00:14:13,789
No music during the game.

261
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:17,208
-It's halftime. Relax, Mr. Herlihy.
-Goddamn Jets.

262
00:14:17,461 --> 00:14:19,371
What are you doing in here, cutie?

263
00:14:19,922 --> 00:14:21,500
Watching football.

264
00:14:21,757 --> 00:14:24,675
-Who do you want to win?
-The goddamn Jets.

265
00:14:25,928 --> 00:14:27,588
Have fun.

266
00:14:28,723 --> 00:14:32,851
Too bad you don't like girls.
I think you could've had her.

267
00:14:33,102 --> 00:14:35,427
-I'm thirsty.
-You're thirsty?

268
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:37,396
Are you allowed soda?

269
00:14:37,648 --> 00:14:38,478
I don't know.

270
00:14:38,733 --> 00:14:40,690
My mom always said
soda rots your teeth...

271
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:43,232
...but you'll lose them
anyway, so rot on.

272
00:14:43,821 --> 00:14:45,944
-Can we get two root beers?
-Sure.

273
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:51,285
When I graduated law school, we met
here every Monday to watch football.

274
00:14:52,622 --> 00:14:54,032
Who would meet you?

275
00:14:54,665 --> 00:14:56,124
My friends, Vanessa.

276
00:14:56,667 --> 00:15:00,879
Vanessa always rooted against the team
I wanted to win just to bust my chops.

277
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,713
But everybody's so busy with
their crap lately, no one comes.

278
00:15:04,967 --> 00:15:06,759
Like I'm not busy?

279
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:10,380
Shut up or I'll smack you
through the wall like last Monday.

280
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,843
Last Monday was a fluke.
Bring it on, woman.

281
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,345
Anytime.

282
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:22,525
He drinks a lot of soda.

283
00:15:27,156 --> 00:15:31,024
I'm telling you, buddy. Vanessa,
she's the one. I can't lose her.

284
00:15:31,285 --> 00:15:33,077
I'm not getting any handsomer.

285
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:36,947
Every day I get a little bit older
and balder and fatter.

286
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:37,954
Fatter?

287
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:41,578
At your age I could eat anything.
Wouldn't gain an ounce.

288
00:15:41,838 --> 00:15:45,420
Now, I have a chocolate shake,
my ass jiggles for a week.

289
00:15:45,675 --> 00:15:49,542
-Enjoy the metabolism while you got it.
-Metalobism?

290
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:54,513
Good God, it's 2:30 in the morning.
You must be wrecked.

291
00:15:55,017 --> 00:15:58,517
Anyways, I had fun today.
Did you have fun?

292
00:15:59,313 --> 00:16:01,270
Yeah, you're all right.

293
00:16:02,191 --> 00:16:03,436
Have a good one.

294
00:16:07,321 --> 00:16:09,278
Could I have a night-light?

295
00:16:09,532 --> 00:16:12,652
Night-light? I think I can
help you out. Hang on.

296
00:16:22,044 --> 00:16:22,993
Let's see here.

297
00:16:24,964 --> 00:16:26,791
There you go, all right?

298
00:16:30,011 --> 00:16:31,505
Are you my dad?

299
00:16:34,432 --> 00:16:36,175
No, I'm not, but...

300
00:16:36,434 --> 00:16:39,554
...that Dad and Mom thing
we'll figure out in the morning.

301
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:43,480
You just go to sleep.

302
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:47,523
-Good night.
-Good night.

303
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,418
Go get the can, okay?

304
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,710
Go! Go! Go!

305
00:17:09,884 --> 00:17:12,042
I'm thinking about keeping the kid.

306
00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:17,304
Remember when we went to
the pet store...

307
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:21,508
...and you wanted that puppy,
but I reminded you about feeding it...

308
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:23,728
...cleaning it
and toilet training it?

309
00:17:23,981 --> 00:17:26,852
This is kind of like that,
except with a human.

310
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:30,525
I mean, I'm glad you had fun and all,
but this is big.

311
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,065
I gotta do something big.
I think Vanessa will respect that.

312
00:17:34,325 --> 00:17:38,702
You think that since women get pregnant
to fix a troubled relationship...

313
00:17:38,955 --> 00:17:41,493
...why can't a guy adopt a kid
to do the same?

314
00:17:41,749 --> 00:17:45,367
I didn't think of it like that.
But yes, that's what I'm thinking.

315
00:17:45,628 --> 00:17:48,997
Sounds nuts to me, pal.
Do yourself a favour. Sleep on it.

316
00:17:49,257 --> 00:17:51,083
You're right.
Can I use your phone?

317
00:17:57,515 --> 00:17:59,057
Arthur Brooks speaking.

318
00:17:59,308 --> 00:18:01,016
How you doing?
Kevin Gerrity.

319
00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:02,679
Right on, Mr Gerrity

320
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:04,182
We were expecting you.

321
00:18:04,438 --> 00:18:07,689
Do you still got a foster family
lined up for Julian?

322
00:18:07,942 --> 00:18:08,772
Yes, we do.

323
00:18:09,026 --> 00:18:11,897
I've decided to
take care of the little guy.

324
00:18:12,154 --> 00:18:13,862
Way to sleep on it, pal.

325
00:18:14,115 --> 00:18:16,866
You two want to get married,
I support that.

326
00:18:17,118 --> 00:18:21,198
When parents take the responsibility,
there's no bigger high for us.

327
00:18:21,455 --> 00:18:22,866
I'm psyched about it too

328
00:18:23,124 --> 00:18:24,120
So that's it.

329
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,332
Yep. Good luck
to you and your son.

330
00:18:27,545 --> 00:18:28,790
My son.

331
00:18:33,384 --> 00:18:34,415
Goddamn stick!

332
00:18:34,677 --> 00:18:36,136
That's my boy.

333
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,688
Go back to sleep.

334
00:18:53,988 --> 00:18:57,523
Well, I'm going back to sleep.
Nighty-night.

335
00:18:58,159 --> 00:18:59,653
I wet my bed.

336
00:19:17,637 --> 00:19:19,510
Oh, God.

337
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:22,297
That's a shitload of piss.

338
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:38,697
There you go, all right?

339
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,823
No more wetness.

340
00:19:41,577 --> 00:19:45,242
Sleep, all right? Just try to sleep.
Stay asleep.

341
00:20:17,154 --> 00:20:18,981
Sit still!

342
00:20:19,657 --> 00:20:20,487
Lay!

343
00:20:28,457 --> 00:20:29,868
All right! I'm up!

344
00:20:30,126 --> 00:20:33,625
It smells like urine in this joint.
Good job.

345
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,290
What're you doing there, boy?

346
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:37,794
Making cereal.

347
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,921
Oh, yeah? Why don't you
pour me a bowl?

348
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:47,890
Or don't pour me a bowl. Either way.

349
00:20:48,144 --> 00:20:50,979
I got it. I got it.

350
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,982
We can fix this.

351
00:20:55,693 --> 00:20:57,686
It's not a big deal.

352
00:20:57,945 --> 00:20:59,523
Look. See?

353
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,939
See how quick it goes away?

354
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:04,237
Crybaby, come on.

355
00:21:04,744 --> 00:21:06,238
Don't worry about it, boy.

356
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,948
Scuba Steve, damn you!

357
00:21:12,126 --> 00:21:14,617
You think that's funny,
me getting hurt?

358
00:21:19,258 --> 00:21:23,007
There's a bright side to being up
before 1 1 : McDonald's breakfast.

359
00:21:23,262 --> 00:21:26,097
I haven't been up for that
in 1 0 years. You wanna go?

360
00:21:27,475 --> 00:21:29,349
Tie your shoes, we'll go. Hurry.

361
00:21:30,478 --> 00:21:33,348
It's like 1 2 blocks from here,
so tie quickly.

362
00:21:37,735 --> 00:21:39,395
Do you need help with that?

363
00:21:39,654 --> 00:21:41,278
I can do it.

364
00:21:43,074 --> 00:21:44,449
Let me do it.

365
00:21:47,787 --> 00:21:50,907
You loop it, you swoop it and you pull.

366
00:21:51,165 --> 00:21:54,250
You loop it, you swoop it, you pull.

367
00:21:54,502 --> 00:21:56,411
Good. Let's go. We're in a hurry.

368
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:58,796
It's different for your generation.

369
00:21:59,048 --> 00:22:01,717
You've always had
McDonald's breakfast available.

370
00:22:01,968 --> 00:22:02,999
I have?

371
00:22:03,261 --> 00:22:06,297
When I was born, all we had were
the burgers and fries.

372
00:22:06,556 --> 00:22:09,971
Maybe the fish sandwich. I'm not sure.
I'll get back to you.

373
00:22:10,226 --> 00:22:11,471
What are you doing?

374
00:22:12,103 --> 00:22:13,977
Oh, yeah, the hand-holding thing.

375
00:22:15,147 --> 00:22:18,931
My dad took us to McDonald's
the first morning they had breakfast.

376
00:22:19,193 --> 00:22:22,693
Everybody was baffled.
"Are these sausages or hamburgers?"

377
00:22:22,947 --> 00:22:24,655
I have to go to the bathroom.

378
00:22:24,907 --> 00:22:26,983
We're gonna be there
in a minute.

379
00:22:27,243 --> 00:22:28,702
I gotta go now.

380
00:22:28,953 --> 00:22:30,531
Didn't you pee enough in bed?

381
00:22:31,664 --> 00:22:34,535
We only got nine minutes
to get there.

382
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:37,793
But I gotta go to the bathroom.

383
00:22:38,045 --> 00:22:39,540
All right, let's go.

384
00:22:40,506 --> 00:22:42,629
Can my kid use the bathroom
for a minute?

385
00:22:42,884 --> 00:22:43,797
Customers only.

386
00:22:44,051 --> 00:22:46,127
He's just a kid.
We'll be in and out.

387
00:22:46,387 --> 00:22:47,715
That's not my problem.

388
00:22:47,972 --> 00:22:50,510
It's not your problem? All right.

389
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:51,881
Come on.

390
00:22:54,437 --> 00:22:57,557
Here you are.
Your waiter will be right with you.

391
00:22:59,108 --> 00:23:00,483
I can't do it.

392
00:23:00,735 --> 00:23:03,107
What do you mean,
you can't do it? Just go.

393
00:23:03,362 --> 00:23:06,529
I'm scared. Could you do it too?

394
00:23:08,451 --> 00:23:09,649
All right.

395
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,860
Here we go.

396
00:23:14,665 --> 00:23:16,076
And we're off.

397
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:20,707
That's not too difficult, right?

398
00:23:20,963 --> 00:23:23,501
And we're both losing weight.

399
00:23:23,883 --> 00:23:27,086
Good job. We're gonna miss
breakfast. Let's go.

400
00:23:27,303 --> 00:23:28,881
Put it away.

401
00:23:32,141 --> 00:23:35,475
-Thanks, anyways.
-Sure thing. Anytime.

402
00:23:35,728 --> 00:23:37,353
Move your ass there, pee-boy.

403
00:23:37,605 --> 00:23:40,891
We only got five minutes,
five minutes. Now four.

404
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,357
Come on. We're almost there.

405
00:23:43,736 --> 00:23:46,571
Hey, mister. Why are you
sitting on the ground?

406
00:23:46,989 --> 00:23:48,152
This is where I live.

407
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:49,403
We gotta get going.

408
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:50,489
Why?

409
00:23:50,868 --> 00:23:54,237
In retrospect, I made some
bad choices after high school.

410
00:23:54,497 --> 00:23:56,240
-We gotta get going.
-Why?

411
00:23:56,499 --> 00:23:58,954
This was during the
so-called Disco Era...

412
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:02,793
...but for me, it was more
the Doing Mushrooms Era.

413
00:24:03,047 --> 00:24:05,372
-We're gonna miss breakfast.
-Why?

414
00:24:05,633 --> 00:24:06,913
I never thought about that.

415
00:24:07,176 --> 00:24:09,667
I was never Mr. Popularity
in high school...

416
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:12,420
...and I watched Fantasia a lot.

417
00:24:12,682 --> 00:24:14,259
-One day it clicked.
-Hey, yappy.

418
00:24:14,517 --> 00:24:16,723
If you end it,
you get an Egg McMuffin.

419
00:24:16,978 --> 00:24:19,054
How about a Sausage McMuffin
with hash browns?

420
00:24:19,313 --> 00:24:20,594
You got a deal.

421
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:24,813
Look, look. He fell asleep.
Let's go.

422
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:26,560
Let's go.

423
00:24:30,491 --> 00:24:33,113
Sausage McMuffin.

424
00:24:33,369 --> 00:24:34,614
Pardon me, sir.

425
00:24:34,871 --> 00:24:36,116
How you doing?

426
00:24:36,372 --> 00:24:37,831
What can I get for you?

427
00:24:38,082 --> 00:24:39,909
-What do you want?
-Cheerios.

428
00:24:40,168 --> 00:24:41,792
They don't got Cheerios.

429
00:24:42,753 --> 00:24:43,667
Lasagna.

430
00:24:43,921 --> 00:24:46,839
What's the matter?
We'll take hot cakes and sausage.

431
00:24:47,091 --> 00:24:49,084
Sorry. We stopped serving breakfast.

432
00:24:49,343 --> 00:24:51,253
We're four seconds late.

433
00:24:51,512 --> 00:24:54,928
You're 30 minutes and four seconds late.
Breakfast stops at 1 0:30.

434
00:24:55,141 --> 00:24:56,220
Horseshit!

435
00:24:59,729 --> 00:25:00,891
Don't cry. Sorry.

436
00:25:01,147 --> 00:25:02,974
I was cursing at the lady, not you.

437
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,263
Nice parenting.

438
00:25:04,525 --> 00:25:06,933
Thanks. Are you my therapist?
Take a walk.

439
00:25:07,195 --> 00:25:08,737
Do you want a Happy Meal?

440
00:25:08,988 --> 00:25:10,530
You got a Happy Meal?

441
00:25:10,781 --> 00:25:12,739
Will somebody
get the kid a Happy Meal?!

442
00:25:13,326 --> 00:25:14,321
Relax.

443
00:25:14,535 --> 00:25:15,911
Where's my Egg McMuffin?

444
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,994
Breakfast is over at 1 0:30.

445
00:25:18,247 --> 00:25:21,248
-Really? I thought it was 1 1 .
-I thought that too.

446
00:25:22,752 --> 00:25:24,543
Total mind blower.

447
00:25:24,795 --> 00:25:27,002
Will you just relax? Here.

448
00:25:27,256 --> 00:25:28,916
What do you want me to do?

449
00:25:29,217 --> 00:25:32,301
You're gonna meet Vanessa tonight.
You'll like her.

450
00:25:32,678 --> 00:25:35,252
You wanna see me get hurt?
That'll cheer you up?

451
00:25:36,182 --> 00:25:37,178
All right.

452
00:25:42,813 --> 00:25:44,687
You think that's funny?

453
00:25:46,025 --> 00:25:47,353
Good. No more crying.

454
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,606
Are you okay?

455
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:50,854
Next time, kill me.

456
00:26:07,004 --> 00:26:08,000
Let's do it, Rangers.

457
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,747
--Rangers against
the Tampa Bay Lightning

458
00:26:11,008 --> 00:26:12,253
And at this stage

459
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:16,342
it's as close as you can get
to a must-win game for the Rangers

460
00:26:16,597 --> 00:26:18,139
Or they'll fall behind--

461
00:26:18,349 --> 00:26:19,179
How you doing?

462
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:20,347
How you doing?

463
00:26:21,018 --> 00:26:21,932
You like hockey?

464
00:26:22,228 --> 00:26:23,224
You like hockey?

465
00:26:23,771 --> 00:26:25,396
This is a big, important game.

466
00:26:25,648 --> 00:26:27,190
This is a big, important game.

467
00:26:27,692 --> 00:26:28,557
Cut the crap.

468
00:26:28,901 --> 00:26:30,064
Cut the crap.

469
00:26:31,696 --> 00:26:33,071
I'm serious. Don't do that.

470
00:26:33,322 --> 00:26:34,982
I'm serious. Don't do that.

471
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:38,740
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck,
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

472
00:26:39,954 --> 00:26:41,496
That's what I thought. Shut up.

473
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:44,704
Don't you take naps?

474
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:46,038
Sometimes.

475
00:26:46,294 --> 00:26:47,492
Go take a nap.

476
00:26:47,753 --> 00:26:49,711
I'm too hungry to sleep.

477
00:26:50,548 --> 00:26:52,256
You want some food?

478
00:27:05,354 --> 00:27:07,430
Having a kid is great...

479
00:27:07,773 --> 00:27:12,020
...as long as his eyes are closed
and he's not moving or speaking.

480
00:27:34,634 --> 00:27:36,507
He's taken down! Penalty shot!

481
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:43,968
How you doing? You sleepwalking?

482
00:27:44,727 --> 00:27:46,803
Why don't you go back sleepy?
Sleepy.

483
00:27:47,063 --> 00:27:48,605
Keep napping. What's this?

484
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,853
Kangaroo song.

485
00:27:50,107 --> 00:27:53,690
That's terrific. And we'll watch this
after the game, okay?

486
00:27:54,028 --> 00:27:57,314
But after my nap,
I always watch the kangaroo song.

487
00:27:57,657 --> 00:28:01,441
It's overtime, and there's
a penalty shot about to take place.

488
00:28:01,786 --> 00:28:02,782
It happens every 1 0 years--

489
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,078
Kangaroo song. Kangaroo song!

490
00:28:08,209 --> 00:28:10,700
All right!

491
00:28:11,796 --> 00:28:13,753
God! You were normal yesterday.

492
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,637
I can't take this.
Are you serious?

493
00:28:27,895 --> 00:28:29,354
Come and play

494
00:28:31,774 --> 00:28:33,518
What do you say?

495
00:28:33,776 --> 00:28:35,105
Douche-bag kangaroo.

496
00:28:38,781 --> 00:28:40,359
Are you all hopped out?

497
00:28:44,203 --> 00:28:46,611
I don't know what to do.
Hopefully Vanessa will.

498
00:28:46,873 --> 00:28:50,288
I think she's back.
If she's not back, we'll wait for her.

499
00:28:50,543 --> 00:28:52,002
Get your coat. Clean up.

500
00:28:53,671 --> 00:28:56,707
Oh, God. You don't
have to pee, do you?

501
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,376
-Do you swear?
-I swear.

502
00:29:01,345 --> 00:29:02,590
How come you're not going?

503
00:29:02,847 --> 00:29:06,547
I don't have to go. Only you and
my grandfather go every 30 seconds.

504
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:09,721
Let's hurry it up, all right?
I'm keeping you company.

505
00:29:11,689 --> 00:29:14,607
He'll write your name on the wall.
Mind your business.

506
00:29:16,277 --> 00:29:18,316
Let's go. Let's go.

507
00:29:19,572 --> 00:29:21,399
Why do I need to meet this lady?

508
00:29:21,657 --> 00:29:23,816
-Now it is your problem.
-Thank you.

509
00:29:24,076 --> 00:29:25,986
She's that lady I was
telling you about.

510
00:29:26,245 --> 00:29:28,819
She's gonna be a big part
of your life.

511
00:29:29,081 --> 00:29:32,035
I'm scared. What if she's not nice?

512
00:29:32,293 --> 00:29:33,491
Look.

513
00:29:34,045 --> 00:29:37,544
See these right here?
These are magic sunglasses, okay?

514
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,047
If you're afraid, put them on
to become invisible.

515
00:29:40,301 --> 00:29:42,128
Really? Nobody can see me?

516
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,584
Put them on.

517
00:29:47,725 --> 00:29:49,006
Sonny, I'm right here.

518
00:29:49,268 --> 00:29:51,308
Oh, the glasses. I couldn't see you.

519
00:29:51,562 --> 00:29:55,263
Keep those on. No one can notice you
until you decide they can.

520
00:29:55,525 --> 00:29:56,390
-Okay.
-Let's go.

521
00:30:00,404 --> 00:30:01,733
I'm still right here.

522
00:30:01,989 --> 00:30:04,148
Okay, all right, the glasses.

523
00:30:09,247 --> 00:30:10,195
Welcome back.

524
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:11,363
Who's that?

525
00:30:11,624 --> 00:30:13,913
Who's who? He's invisible.

526
00:30:15,628 --> 00:30:16,577
Can I come in?

527
00:30:17,296 --> 00:30:18,126
Sure.

528
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:20,790
Any invisible people out here...

529
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,043
...feel free to come in, okay?

530
00:30:25,638 --> 00:30:28,555
Sonny, I don't really know
what's going on right now.

531
00:30:28,808 --> 00:30:31,678
-We should talk--
-You said I got some thinking to do?

532
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,216
So I did it.

533
00:30:33,563 --> 00:30:37,228
Just because I don't have a job
doesn't mean I don't wanna move on.

534
00:30:37,525 --> 00:30:39,814
Instead of saying that,
I figured I'd show you.

535
00:30:40,069 --> 00:30:42,358
-Before you say anything--
-Look at that.

536
00:30:42,697 --> 00:30:44,107
He took his sunglasses off.

537
00:30:44,365 --> 00:30:46,405
He wants you to see him.
He likes you.

538
00:30:47,034 --> 00:30:48,066
Julian, come here.

539
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:50,829
Come here, pal.

540
00:30:51,205 --> 00:30:52,450
Vanessa...

541
00:30:52,707 --> 00:30:55,624
...l want you to meet Julian, my son.

542
00:30:56,794 --> 00:30:58,253
Our son. I adopted him.

543
00:30:59,714 --> 00:31:01,505
I don't know what to say.

544
00:31:01,757 --> 00:31:03,133
Don't say anything.

545
00:31:06,721 --> 00:31:08,132
Is someone in the bathroom?

546
00:31:10,516 --> 00:31:11,465
Why is the door shut?

547
00:31:11,726 --> 00:31:12,556
I don't know.

548
00:31:12,894 --> 00:31:14,008
You don't?

549
00:31:15,813 --> 00:31:17,272
I don't know.

550
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,105
I can't believe this.

551
00:31:24,155 --> 00:31:24,985
Open up.

552
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,277
Open the door!

553
00:31:30,244 --> 00:31:33,494
-Is everything okay?
-Oh, my God.

554
00:31:33,956 --> 00:31:35,949
I'm sorry. I was freaking out there.

555
00:31:36,209 --> 00:31:37,786
-I'm Sonny.
-Sid.

556
00:31:38,044 --> 00:31:41,958
I had an attack of paranoia. I thought
you were sleeping with my girl.

557
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:43,673
I am.

558
00:31:43,925 --> 00:31:44,838
What's that?

559
00:31:46,219 --> 00:31:47,333
I am.

560
00:31:47,595 --> 00:31:51,011
That's what I was trying to tell you
before. I found someone.

561
00:31:51,265 --> 00:31:53,139
-This old guy?
-Sid.

562
00:31:53,392 --> 00:31:55,184
He's already achieved so much...

563
00:31:55,436 --> 00:31:58,307
...and yet he's still goal-oriented
and still focused.

564
00:31:58,564 --> 00:32:00,058
And he has a five-year plan.

565
00:32:00,316 --> 00:32:01,810
What is it? " Don't die"?

566
00:32:02,693 --> 00:32:06,905
I can't believe this. We got
a family now. This is what you wanted.

567
00:32:07,156 --> 00:32:09,861
You surprising me with a kid
that you adopted...

568
00:32:10,117 --> 00:32:12,443
-...wasn't what I wanted.
-I did this for you.

569
00:32:12,703 --> 00:32:16,535
You wanted me to be more responsible.
I can't raise this kid alone.

570
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:20,076
You remind me of my grandson.
You don't think things through.

571
00:32:20,336 --> 00:32:23,207
Hey, Old Man River, zip it
or I'll break your hip.

572
00:32:23,548 --> 00:32:25,505
-I'd like to see you try it.
-Shut up.

573
00:32:25,758 --> 00:32:28,296
How'd you misconstrue
the situation so badly?

574
00:32:28,553 --> 00:32:30,177
I don't know.

575
00:32:31,556 --> 00:32:34,011
Deep down you must've known
this day was coming.

576
00:32:35,434 --> 00:32:37,760
You made the biggest mistake
of your life.

577
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,143
I know you'll be missing me
when you got...

578
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:42,686
...that big, white, wrinkly...

579
00:32:42,942 --> 00:32:44,401
...body on top of you...

580
00:32:44,652 --> 00:32:46,443
...with his loose skin...

581
00:32:46,696 --> 00:32:48,487
...and old balls.

582
00:32:48,739 --> 00:32:50,364
Gross.

583
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,207
Excuse me. How you doing?
I'm Kevin Gerrity.

584
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,296
I got an emergency problem.
Is Arthur Brooks around?

585
00:33:04,547 --> 00:33:06,006
I'll go get him for you.

586
00:33:06,257 --> 00:33:09,377
Stay where I can see you.
I gotta talk to this guy.

587
00:33:09,635 --> 00:33:11,130
Mr. Gerrity?

588
00:33:11,512 --> 00:33:14,679
-Arthur Brooks.
-How are you? I need to speak with you.

589
00:33:14,932 --> 00:33:16,925
I didn't tell you to come here, did l?

590
00:33:17,185 --> 00:33:19,224
I was gonna mail you
the paperwork.

591
00:33:19,478 --> 00:33:21,352
It's like the opposite of that.

592
00:33:21,814 --> 00:33:23,771
Look, I can't manage this kid.

593
00:33:24,108 --> 00:33:26,895
I ain't a good father.
I made a big mistake.

594
00:33:27,153 --> 00:33:27,935
Mistake?

595
00:33:28,196 --> 00:33:30,521
I had a mother lined up for him...

596
00:33:30,781 --> 00:33:33,403
...but she's banging
the Pepperidge Farm guy.

597
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:35,866
The kid won't stop
peeing and throwing up.

598
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,741
He's like a cocker spaniel.
I just....

599
00:33:38,998 --> 00:33:41,323
He'd be better off
with his natural mother.

600
00:33:42,043 --> 00:33:44,878
Well, she passed away last night,
Mr. Gerrity.

601
00:33:45,129 --> 00:33:49,458
She had cancer. She must have sensed
that her time was running short.

602
00:33:49,717 --> 00:33:52,386
She wanted her son to be with
the natural father.

603
00:33:55,348 --> 00:33:56,628
Loop.

604
00:33:57,475 --> 00:33:58,340
Pull.

605
00:33:59,227 --> 00:34:01,018
If you don't wanna take care
of him...

606
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:04,805
...we'll take him. But he'll have to
chill in a group home.

607
00:34:05,066 --> 00:34:06,774
Group home? Like an orphanage?

608
00:34:07,026 --> 00:34:08,485
We don't call them that.

609
00:34:11,322 --> 00:34:14,276
Look, I did it.
Loop, swoop and pull.

610
00:34:14,534 --> 00:34:15,482
You did do it.

611
00:34:15,743 --> 00:34:17,118
Congratulations, kid.

612
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,947
I showed him that.

613
00:34:19,205 --> 00:34:21,612
Why don't you go back over there, okay?

614
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,121
-I'll call the Heatherton Home--
-Let's do this.

615
00:34:25,378 --> 00:34:28,747
I'll hang onto the kid
until you find him a new family.

616
00:34:29,006 --> 00:34:32,340
I don't know. I gotta watch out
for the kid's best interest.

617
00:34:32,593 --> 00:34:34,835
You said yourself you were a bogus dad.

618
00:34:35,096 --> 00:34:37,172
He's better off with me
than in an orphanage.

619
00:34:37,515 --> 00:34:40,184
I don't wanna put him in a home
any more than you do.

620
00:34:40,434 --> 00:34:43,222
Why don't we pretend you
didn't even come in here?

621
00:34:43,479 --> 00:34:46,397
I'll give you a shout
when I line up a family.

622
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:47,847
-That's good.
-Later.

623
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,942
Just don't make me regret this.

624
00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:52,147
Where are we going now?

625
00:34:52,405 --> 00:34:56,533
I gotta make a phone call.
Just stay right here, all right?

626
00:35:01,914 --> 00:35:04,619
-This is a collect call from:
-Your baby boy

627
00:35:04,876 --> 00:35:07,627
-To accept charges, say, "Yes "
-Yeah, I'll accept.

628
00:35:08,004 --> 00:35:09,913
Dad, how's it going?
How's Florida?

629
00:35:10,173 --> 00:35:13,542
Not too bad. Your mother got
a sunburn playing tennis.

630
00:35:13,801 --> 00:35:16,719
-I got some interesting news.
-Oh, yeah? What?

631
00:35:16,971 --> 00:35:18,679
Kind of adopted a kid.

632
00:35:18,931 --> 00:35:20,010
What do you mean?

633
00:35:20,266 --> 00:35:23,183
I'm talking about
you being a grandfather.

634
00:35:23,436 --> 00:35:25,179
Who the hell would give you a kid?

635
00:35:25,438 --> 00:35:26,897
Social Services.

636
00:35:27,148 --> 00:35:29,390
You idiot. You better give
that kid back.

637
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,275
His mother's....

638
00:35:31,569 --> 00:35:32,732
Hang on.

639
00:35:32,987 --> 00:35:34,980
Go play with them pigeons, buddy.

640
00:35:35,281 --> 00:35:38,401
I tried to give him back.
I just can't. All right?

641
00:35:38,659 --> 00:35:40,070
I need your help.

642
00:35:40,411 --> 00:35:43,910
I'm in a bad way Vanessa dumped me
I don't know what I'm doing

643
00:35:44,165 --> 00:35:45,908
You're damn right.

644
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:47,910
The kid is always around.

645
00:35:48,169 --> 00:35:50,327
He never leaves me alone.

646
00:35:50,588 --> 00:35:53,791
You'd think he'd want some privacy.
I'm in deep shit.

647
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,837
Give that kid back before
you ruin both your lives.

648
00:35:57,094 --> 00:35:58,257
I appreciate that.

649
00:35:58,513 --> 00:36:00,552
He's better off living in a dumpster.

650
00:36:00,806 --> 00:36:02,466
I'll be a better father than you!

651
00:36:02,725 --> 00:36:05,050
Impossible!
All you care about is yourself!

652
00:36:05,311 --> 00:36:08,727
Yeah? No, I care about you
saving money on this call!

653
00:36:14,195 --> 00:36:15,440
Let's eat.

654
00:36:17,031 --> 00:36:19,071
The Vanessa thing did not work out.

655
00:36:19,325 --> 00:36:22,776
She lost her damn mind.
That wasn't your fault, though, okay?

656
00:36:24,622 --> 00:36:28,620
I know when you first got here, you
thought you were gonna meet your dad.

657
00:36:28,876 --> 00:36:31,201
But I don't think
that's gonna happen.

658
00:36:31,504 --> 00:36:32,334
Why?

659
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:33,870
I don't know.

660
00:36:34,298 --> 00:36:37,003
But, buddy, real dads
aren't always that great.

661
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,133
I got one and he's
out of his mind.

662
00:36:39,387 --> 00:36:43,219
He tells me what to do. He never lets
me figure stuff out on my own.

663
00:36:43,474 --> 00:36:46,677
A lot of dads are like that.
That's why people grow up nuts.

664
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,931
Look at this guy.

665
00:36:49,188 --> 00:36:52,972
He was probably a nice boy like you.
Then his dad messed his mind up.

666
00:36:53,234 --> 00:36:54,645
Who won the Jets game?

667
00:36:54,902 --> 00:36:55,851
Who cares?

668
00:36:56,112 --> 00:36:58,354
Let it go.
He can't control you anymore.

669
00:36:58,614 --> 00:36:59,646
What do you mean?

670
00:36:59,907 --> 00:37:00,938
You know.

671
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,114
You're a loser.

672
00:37:02,368 --> 00:37:05,073
You're mad at your dad, not at me!
I forgive you!

673
00:37:05,496 --> 00:37:08,166
I am. I am. I hate my father.

674
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:11,951
I don't want it to be like that.
I don't wanna control you.

675
00:37:12,336 --> 00:37:13,795
You even like your name?

676
00:37:14,463 --> 00:37:15,293
I guess.

677
00:37:15,548 --> 00:37:17,671
You guess? Shouldn't you like
your name?

678
00:37:17,925 --> 00:37:20,251
It'll be your name
the rest of your life.

679
00:37:20,761 --> 00:37:21,960
What do you want?

680
00:37:24,056 --> 00:37:25,599
Frankenstein.

681
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:29,017
I can deal with that.
I'll call you Frankenstein.

682
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:31,263
Frankenstein, you gonna play
in the puddle?

683
00:37:31,522 --> 00:37:34,772
Go ahead. From now on, you do
whatever you wanna do.

684
00:37:35,026 --> 00:37:37,268
I'll show you some cool shit
along the way.

685
00:37:37,528 --> 00:37:39,153
That's what it's all about.

686
00:37:41,032 --> 00:37:43,108
Stay in front of it.
Don't be scared.

687
00:37:43,367 --> 00:37:45,241
It's coming right at you.

688
00:37:45,745 --> 00:37:46,741
Okay. All right.

689
00:37:46,996 --> 00:37:49,404
You're picking your head up.
Don't do that.

690
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:52,541
Is this okay?

691
00:37:52,793 --> 00:37:54,585
That's what you wanna wear?

692
00:37:55,546 --> 00:37:56,922
That's okay with me then.

693
00:37:57,173 --> 00:37:59,628
Good luck walking down the street.

694
00:38:01,385 --> 00:38:03,093
Way to block it. Stay with it.

695
00:38:03,346 --> 00:38:05,469
You're the next Willie Randolph.

696
00:38:15,483 --> 00:38:18,353
Chief Jay Strongbow
used to do a sleeper hold.

697
00:38:18,611 --> 00:38:19,809
Put your arm under here.

698
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:24,400
Lift this arm, okay? Slide under
and try to lock wrists.

699
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:26,153
Let me show you. Watch.

700
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,948
Throw him into the ropes
and he comes back....

701
00:38:29,789 --> 00:38:32,114
Get him. Get him. Lock him up.

702
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:33,750
Lock wrists.

703
00:38:34,126 --> 00:38:35,669
You bring him down slow.

704
00:38:36,212 --> 00:38:37,540
Apply pressure.

705
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,458
He's going to sleep now.

706
00:38:42,301 --> 00:38:43,215
See, he's out.

707
00:38:54,605 --> 00:38:55,720
Wake up.

708
00:39:01,779 --> 00:39:04,733
You'll be the only kid your age
with a slingshot.

709
00:39:05,157 --> 00:39:08,526
Go have some fun. Shoot a few
beer cans or something.

710
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,570
You like that?

711
00:39:18,546 --> 00:39:19,957
Sonny, Sonny, come here!

712
00:39:20,214 --> 00:39:22,171
What is it? What's the matter?

713
00:39:28,097 --> 00:39:29,722
Let me have that.

714
00:39:30,766 --> 00:39:33,684
Go to your room. I think.
Or do whatever you want.

715
00:39:34,687 --> 00:39:36,845
It's gonna be fun. You nervous?

716
00:39:37,106 --> 00:39:39,312
No? You're excited, aren't you?

717
00:39:39,567 --> 00:39:42,022
Let's go. Up, up, up.

718
00:39:43,529 --> 00:39:45,522
Here comes some candy.

719
00:39:48,367 --> 00:39:49,197
How you doing?

720
00:39:50,661 --> 00:39:53,069
Happy Halloween!
We got a first-timer.

721
00:39:57,668 --> 00:39:58,997
Do the right thing, buddy.

722
00:39:59,253 --> 00:40:01,460
We want some candy!

723
00:40:05,927 --> 00:40:08,465
Hang on right here for a second.
Don't move.

724
00:40:23,152 --> 00:40:24,694
Yeah, that's it.

725
00:40:26,113 --> 00:40:28,023
Yeah, CDs. You like that?

726
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,906
He's not happy. What else you got?

727
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,072
Okay, that's good. Trick-or-treat.

728
00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:40,416
Say, " Happy Halloween."

729
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,662
Thank you.

730
00:40:42,922 --> 00:40:45,413
Next year, be prepared, moron.

731
00:40:48,761 --> 00:40:50,339
What's with the cummerbund?

732
00:40:50,596 --> 00:40:52,340
I let him wear whatever he wants.

733
00:40:52,598 --> 00:40:54,057
Those boots are the best.

734
00:40:54,308 --> 00:40:56,135
I think they're Kevin's.

735
00:40:56,435 --> 00:40:59,639
I'll have a hot dog with
the mustard and a knish.

736
00:40:59,897 --> 00:41:01,308
Frankenstein, what do you want?

737
00:41:01,566 --> 00:41:03,060
Thirty packets of ketchup.

738
00:41:03,317 --> 00:41:05,773
All right. Thirty packets of ketchup.

739
00:41:07,488 --> 00:41:08,733
Nice cut, pal.

740
00:41:10,867 --> 00:41:11,815
Frankenstein.

741
00:41:12,201 --> 00:41:14,573
Do that thing I taught you
the other day.

742
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:24,496
It took him 20 minutes to learn that.
He's quick. He's smart.

743
00:41:24,755 --> 00:41:26,748
-And he loves ketchup.
-He does.

744
00:41:27,008 --> 00:41:29,333
This is a whole new school
of child-raising.

745
00:41:29,594 --> 00:41:32,927
You give him options, not orders.
Let him make the decision.

746
00:41:33,181 --> 00:41:34,295
You're a pioneer.

747
00:41:34,557 --> 00:41:37,511
-So you two just chill out all day?
-Basically.

748
00:41:37,768 --> 00:41:41,184
Hung out on the monkey bars.
The kid did eight chin-ups.

749
00:41:41,439 --> 00:41:43,894
I can't even do one
with these scrawny arms.

750
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:46,226
They're not scrawny. They're nice.

751
00:41:47,153 --> 00:41:49,311
What do you wanna do tomorrow?

752
00:41:49,572 --> 00:41:51,232
I wanna go to school.

753
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:54,859
I don't force him, he makes
the right decision. Way to go.

754
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,871
We'll enroll you on Monday.
Enjoy the weekend.

755
00:41:58,122 --> 00:41:59,320
Do the thing again.

756
00:42:07,048 --> 00:42:09,799
That one touched the ground.

757
00:42:10,051 --> 00:42:11,165
That was awesome!

758
00:42:11,427 --> 00:42:12,672
Good job.

759
00:42:16,349 --> 00:42:19,552
Help me! Help me!

760
00:42:20,186 --> 00:42:22,677
Please help me.
I don't know where I live.

761
00:42:22,939 --> 00:42:25,097
This isn't a big problem.

762
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:27,516
We'll find your parents.

763
00:42:27,818 --> 00:42:30,060
-What's your name?
-Frankenstein.

764
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:32,234
There you are.

765
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:34,613
There you are. Are you okay, buddy?

766
00:42:35,451 --> 00:42:37,408
I turn my head and he disappeared.

767
00:42:37,662 --> 00:42:40,449
Don't you ever do that to me again.
Don't do that.

768
00:42:40,915 --> 00:42:43,584
Thank you for being sweet
to my little boy.

769
00:42:43,835 --> 00:42:45,542
You're welcome, Sonny.

770
00:42:46,796 --> 00:42:49,916
I think my sister, Corinne,
is engaged to your roommate.

771
00:42:50,174 --> 00:42:52,926
Your sister's Corinne? That sucks.

772
00:42:53,177 --> 00:42:55,964
Yeah, I'm up from D.C.
I was at that party...

773
00:42:56,222 --> 00:42:58,713
...where we wasted
the good surprise on you.

774
00:42:58,975 --> 00:43:00,054
Sorry about that.

775
00:43:00,601 --> 00:43:02,345
So, what, you have a son now?

776
00:43:02,603 --> 00:43:05,521
I'm not his dad.
I'm more of a father-figure type...

777
00:43:05,773 --> 00:43:08,560
...until Social Services
can get another family.

778
00:43:08,818 --> 00:43:10,857
At which point,
you'll find a new way...

779
00:43:11,112 --> 00:43:13,947
...to initiate conversations
with girls in the park.

780
00:43:14,198 --> 00:43:15,906
Yeah, that's correct.

781
00:43:19,245 --> 00:43:20,408
Good job, buddy!

782
00:43:20,788 --> 00:43:22,163
He's peeing on his own.

783
00:43:22,415 --> 00:43:23,992
Keep it flowing! That's it!

784
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,289
Go! Go!

785
00:43:26,711 --> 00:43:29,284
So does Corinne's sister have a name?

786
00:43:29,755 --> 00:43:30,751
It's Layla.

787
00:43:31,007 --> 00:43:33,462
Layla? I like your song.

788
00:43:34,385 --> 00:43:35,630
Could you do me a favour?

789
00:43:35,887 --> 00:43:37,297
Could you hang out with me?

790
00:43:37,555 --> 00:43:40,224
He'll think he's a failure
if he couldn't get me a date.

791
00:43:40,474 --> 00:43:41,637
I really can't.

792
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:44,554
I have a ton of work to do.

793
00:43:44,812 --> 00:43:46,935
I see. Hang on a second.

794
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:48,352
Come here.

795
00:43:52,403 --> 00:43:56,531
Layla, if you don't come over
to Sonny's apartment tonight...

796
00:43:56,782 --> 00:43:59,534
...there's a good chance
I'll develop a stutter.

797
00:44:01,037 --> 00:44:04,240
P-P-P-Please don't do this to me.

798
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:07,198
-That is so cheap.
-What?

799
00:44:14,467 --> 00:44:16,590
So I'm working in a tollbooth now.

800
00:44:16,844 --> 00:44:19,252
I originally wanted to be
a male model...

801
00:44:19,514 --> 00:44:22,633
...but I'm not very good-looking,
so that didn't work out.

802
00:44:22,892 --> 00:44:24,303
I'm sorry to hear that.

803
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,268
I'm all right. I'm recovering.

804
00:44:26,521 --> 00:44:29,190
This is my favourite part
of the song right here.

805
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,480
If I can't have you

806
00:44:32,652 --> 00:44:35,688
Better keep it down low.
The kid's gonna wake up.

807
00:44:37,114 --> 00:44:38,525
Too late.

808
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,775
Okay. Just hang out a little bit.

809
00:44:41,035 --> 00:44:43,822
I'll be right back.
Don't go sneaking out.

810
00:44:45,665 --> 00:44:48,831
-What are you doing?
-You forgot to say good night.

811
00:44:49,085 --> 00:44:50,164
What do you mean?

812
00:44:50,419 --> 00:44:53,041
I can't go to sleep
until you say good night.

813
00:44:53,297 --> 00:44:55,871
I didn't know that.
I'm sorry. Good night.

814
00:44:56,425 --> 00:44:58,003
Go to sleep now, all right?

815
00:44:58,261 --> 00:44:59,636
What'd we learn about girls?

816
00:44:59,887 --> 00:45:03,422
Initiating the conversation
is half the battle.

817
00:45:03,683 --> 00:45:05,925
Bingo. Now sleep, okay?

818
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:16,526
I gave him NyQuil.
He should be out for the night.

819
00:45:17,113 --> 00:45:21,241
This is Styx. They've been
my favourite band since I was 1 2.

820
00:45:21,492 --> 00:45:22,571
You're kidding me.

821
00:45:22,827 --> 00:45:25,532
No, I can't help it.
I just love them.

822
00:45:25,788 --> 00:45:27,532
My friends make fun of me.

823
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:31,076
My friends make fun of me too.
I've seen them 25 times.

824
00:45:31,335 --> 00:45:34,040
Tommy Shaw, when I was 1 6,
I was at the concert...

825
00:45:34,297 --> 00:45:36,538
...and he reached down,
pulled me on stage.

826
00:45:36,924 --> 00:45:39,083
I did the robot voice for " Mr. Roboto."

827
00:45:39,343 --> 00:45:40,090
Really?

828
00:45:40,344 --> 00:45:42,052
No, I made that up. I'm sorry.

829
00:45:42,305 --> 00:45:44,131
That would've been cool, right?

830
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:46,217
My cousin's friends
with their drummer...

831
00:45:46,475 --> 00:45:48,883
...so when they come to town,
we go to dinner...

832
00:45:49,145 --> 00:45:51,303
...and they tell us stories
from the road.

833
00:45:51,564 --> 00:45:52,310
Really?

834
00:45:52,565 --> 00:45:55,850
No, I made that up again too.
I'm sorry.

835
00:45:56,277 --> 00:45:59,812
You're not attracted to, like,
60-year-old guys, are you?

836
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:03,563
Yeah, I don't like them either.

837
00:46:05,953 --> 00:46:08,029
I can't sleep.

838
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,579
He can't sleep.

839
00:46:12,835 --> 00:46:16,880
So the rabbit ran across the street...

840
00:46:17,131 --> 00:46:20,215
...because he thought
he saw some carrots.

841
00:46:20,468 --> 00:46:22,674
But when he got across the street...

842
00:46:22,929 --> 00:46:25,846
...it turned out they weren't carrots,
they were peanuts.

843
00:46:26,098 --> 00:46:27,890
Peanuts?

844
00:46:29,185 --> 00:46:31,937
The peanuts belonged to a squirrel...

845
00:46:32,188 --> 00:46:35,391
...who had taken them home
from a baseball game.

846
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:38,485
And then the rabbit
thought to himself...

847
00:46:38,903 --> 00:46:40,942
..." Carrots, peanuts,
what's the difference?"

848
00:46:41,614 --> 00:46:44,485
So he asked the squirrel
if he could have some.

849
00:46:44,742 --> 00:46:46,699
And the squirrel said, "Of course."

850
00:46:46,953 --> 00:46:50,997
And the rabbit was very happy
to make such a nice new friend.

851
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:55,035
And so was the squirrel.

852
00:46:55,294 --> 00:46:57,999
And the rabbit thought the squirrel
had pretty hair.

853
00:46:58,756 --> 00:47:01,164
And nice eyes also.

854
00:47:02,134 --> 00:47:05,301
And the squirrel thought the rabbit
was really nice too.

855
00:47:05,555 --> 00:47:09,054
And then, the rabbit
worked up his courage...

856
00:47:09,308 --> 00:47:11,550
...and asked the squirrel
if he could have...

857
00:47:11,811 --> 00:47:14,480
...just the littlest squirrel kiss.

858
00:47:15,356 --> 00:47:19,140
And the squirrel thought
it just wasn't the right time...

859
00:47:19,402 --> 00:47:22,486
...in her busy squirrel life
to be kissing any rabbits...

860
00:47:22,738 --> 00:47:26,190
...even though this particular rabbit
was very sweet.

861
00:47:26,701 --> 00:47:28,989
And the rabbit got shut down, did he?

862
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:35,494
That's all right.
But he was still thinking maybe...

863
00:47:35,751 --> 00:47:38,587
...Scuba Steve could get
a squirrel kiss...

864
00:47:38,838 --> 00:47:40,914
...so somebody's getting some action.

865
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:49,839
Good night, Scuba Steve.

866
00:47:50,683 --> 00:47:52,261
Good night, Frankenstein.

867
00:47:54,145 --> 00:47:55,425
Good night, Sonny.

868
00:47:55,688 --> 00:47:57,313
Good night, Layla.

869
00:48:00,568 --> 00:48:02,359
Don't get caught with any girls.

870
00:48:02,612 --> 00:48:04,735
It's your first day. Take it slow.

871
00:48:05,031 --> 00:48:07,948
I'll meet you after school
at 2:30, right out front.

872
00:48:08,492 --> 00:48:09,655
You're not staying?

873
00:48:09,911 --> 00:48:12,402
No, I gotta go get you
some more ketchup.

874
00:48:12,663 --> 00:48:14,241
I don't like these kids.

875
00:48:14,499 --> 00:48:17,453
I don't either,
but shouldn't we give them a chance?

876
00:48:20,171 --> 00:48:21,416
How's this?

877
00:48:23,716 --> 00:48:26,041
Here are the magic sunglasses.

878
00:48:26,302 --> 00:48:29,219
You put them on
if you feel scared, okay?

879
00:48:31,182 --> 00:48:32,261
I lost you.

880
00:48:32,517 --> 00:48:34,805
I don't know where you are.
I'm sorry.

881
00:48:36,103 --> 00:48:37,384
Oh, there you go.

882
00:48:38,898 --> 00:48:41,223
You go inside and make some friends.

883
00:48:42,151 --> 00:48:43,943
Oh, yeah, that's a good hug.

884
00:48:44,195 --> 00:48:46,982
All right. Go inside.
I'm gonna miss you.

885
00:48:50,618 --> 00:48:52,492
Hi, I like your hat.

886
00:48:52,745 --> 00:48:54,287
What's your name?

887
00:49:06,467 --> 00:49:08,756
-Might as well--
-Leave a message!

888
00:49:10,221 --> 00:49:12,297
-Might as well--
-Leave a message!

889
00:49:12,598 --> 00:49:17,011
Mr Gerrity, this is Arthur Brooks
from Social Services I got good news

890
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:19,428
We may have found
a family for Julian

891
00:49:19,689 --> 00:49:22,061
Give me a call back
as soon as possible

892
00:49:22,316 --> 00:49:24,807
so we can set up a meeting Bye

893
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:37,282
Sierra Club Legal Department.

894
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,034
Can I speak to Layla Maloney?

895
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,707
Layla, line four.

896
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:45,875
You're a lawyer?

897
00:49:46,174 --> 00:49:47,584
What are you doing?

898
00:49:47,842 --> 00:49:51,175
Waiting for Julian so I can have
somebody to play with.

899
00:49:51,762 --> 00:49:53,506
-What are you doing?
-I'm swamped.

900
00:49:53,764 --> 00:49:55,840
I gotta do my laundry
on my lunch hour.

901
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:59,101
I was gonna do my laundry today too.
Where are you going?

902
00:49:59,353 --> 00:50:02,105
There's a place nearby,
Suds, on Bleecker.

903
00:50:02,356 --> 00:50:05,191
I know that place.
Maybe I'll see you there then.

904
00:50:05,443 --> 00:50:07,768
Maybe. I gotta go.

905
00:50:17,997 --> 00:50:20,784
I bought tickets,
and the show was the night before

906
00:50:21,042 --> 00:50:21,955
Maybe it was a mistake

907
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:26,077
That's nice, but you don't know
what's going down on the streets.

908
00:50:26,547 --> 00:50:28,207
It's hard to know what's going down...

909
00:50:28,466 --> 00:50:31,965
...when you're in an office
seven days a week, Mr. Tollbooth.

910
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,426
You're not gonna tell me
to get a real job.

911
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,756
No. You're a big boy.

912
00:50:37,016 --> 00:50:39,056
It's cool you only work
one day a week.

913
00:50:40,186 --> 00:50:42,759
These are the cutest things
I've ever seen.

914
00:50:43,022 --> 00:50:43,804
I know.

915
00:50:44,065 --> 00:50:46,734
I have them in yellow.
I wear them when I work out.

916
00:50:48,152 --> 00:50:51,272
It's great what you're doing
with Julian while you got him.

917
00:50:51,739 --> 00:50:52,735
Yeah, well, I got him.

918
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:54,650
I read an article that said...

919
00:50:54,909 --> 00:50:58,159
...the most important influences
in a kid's life are his friends.

920
00:50:58,412 --> 00:50:59,610
They said that?

921
00:50:59,872 --> 00:51:04,084
Just hope he's not hanging out with
drug dealers and delinquents in school.

922
00:51:06,629 --> 00:51:07,708
I'm kidding.

923
00:51:09,257 --> 00:51:10,288
I know. I know.

924
00:51:12,051 --> 00:51:14,969
Man, this Yoo-hoo is good.
You know what else is good?

925
00:51:15,221 --> 00:51:16,799
Smoking dope.

926
00:51:17,181 --> 00:51:18,723
I ain't going to rat you out.

927
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:20,173
Puffing the cheeba.

928
00:51:20,434 --> 00:51:24,218
Go by the seesaw, smoke a J.
You know what I'm talking about?

929
00:51:24,814 --> 00:51:26,273
I have a bellybutton.

930
00:51:26,566 --> 00:51:29,139
You have a bellybutton?
We all have bellybuttons.

931
00:51:29,402 --> 00:51:32,438
And we all love Yoo-hoo.
Especially with a little rum.

932
00:51:32,655 --> 00:51:33,520
What's rum?

933
00:51:33,781 --> 00:51:34,896
You don't know?

934
00:51:35,157 --> 00:51:36,237
Rumpelstiltskin?

935
00:51:38,452 --> 00:51:40,990
Rumpelstiltskin's a good man.
So are you guys.

936
00:51:41,956 --> 00:51:44,198
Stay clean. Stay focused.

937
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:47,163
Frankenstein,
have fun with your friends.

938
00:51:48,796 --> 00:51:50,623
Why are you scratching so much?

939
00:51:50,882 --> 00:51:52,874
I have ecza....

940
00:51:53,134 --> 00:51:54,545
Eczema? Gross.

941
00:51:54,802 --> 00:51:56,427
How do I make it stop itching?

942
00:51:56,679 --> 00:51:59,087
I don't know. You scratch it.

943
00:51:59,348 --> 00:52:01,507
SpaghettiO's. Do you like
SpaghettiO's?

944
00:52:04,604 --> 00:52:06,062
Dented cans are half price.

945
00:52:06,314 --> 00:52:09,765
Microsoft went down three points.
We gotta save some money.

946
00:52:11,944 --> 00:52:13,438
Here, give it a shot.

947
00:52:14,989 --> 00:52:16,400
That's it, boy.

948
00:52:16,657 --> 00:52:18,235
Put it in there. Feels good.

949
00:52:18,492 --> 00:52:21,066
Hi, Sonny.
Hi, Sonny's friend.

950
00:52:21,329 --> 00:52:22,527
His name's Frankenstein.

951
00:52:22,955 --> 00:52:24,615
Hi, Frankenstein. Remember me?

952
00:52:24,874 --> 00:52:27,543
Help me. I'm lost.
I don't know where I am.

953
00:52:27,793 --> 00:52:29,169
You don't gotta do that.

954
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:32,504
You guys wear the same size
T-shirt. That's cool.

955
00:52:32,757 --> 00:52:34,915
I heard you did laundry
with my sister.

956
00:52:35,176 --> 00:52:36,456
She said we did laundry?

957
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:39,554
Where I'm from, it's called
doing the hibbity-dibbity.

958
00:52:41,349 --> 00:52:42,629
I got eczema.

959
00:52:43,017 --> 00:52:45,306
Well, then you shouldn't scratch it.

960
00:52:45,561 --> 00:52:48,231
Don't tell him what to do.
He can scratch.

961
00:52:48,481 --> 00:52:50,189
-Scratch.
-Is that better?

962
00:52:50,441 --> 00:52:52,232
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

963
00:52:52,735 --> 00:52:55,440
You know about kids?
I thought you were a foot doctor.

964
00:52:55,696 --> 00:52:59,824
It's not doctor stuff. It's common
sense. Scratching spreads rashes.

965
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:02,318
This is something
you learned at Hooters.

966
00:53:06,874 --> 00:53:09,448
-What the hell is he doing?
-He's shopping.

967
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:12,166
Microsoft went down three points.

968
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,169
That's good.
See you later, Frankenstein.

969
00:53:15,424 --> 00:53:18,959
Stay away from the frozen-food section.
Your boobs'll harden.

970
00:53:26,936 --> 00:53:29,012
Isn't Little ltaly the greatest?

971
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:33,400
I like it. Everyone always tells me
to hang out in the Village and SoHo.

972
00:53:33,651 --> 00:53:34,564
That's all right.

973
00:53:34,819 --> 00:53:38,982
But you gotta respect a place where
the fatter you are, the cooler you are.

974
00:53:43,452 --> 00:53:46,952
Last time, he was with
a different girl. I guess he ate her.

975
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:52,418
I went to Coney lsland today
with the little boy.

976
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:54,828
You gotta take a look at this.

977
00:53:55,089 --> 00:53:57,046
We had a blast together.

978
00:53:58,926 --> 00:54:00,255
He's so happy.

979
00:54:00,511 --> 00:54:01,887
He is such a good boy.

980
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:05,637
If I have a kid of my own,
I hope he's half as cool as that kid.

981
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:07,637
Is he picking your nose?

982
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:10,183
Yeah, he was picking his own all day...

983
00:54:10,438 --> 00:54:12,810
-...so I figured he could borrow mine.
-Sweet.

984
00:54:13,232 --> 00:54:15,521
He must be miserable
without you right now.

985
00:54:15,776 --> 00:54:17,235
No, he's in good hands.

986
00:54:19,113 --> 00:54:21,900
Look at Brad's body.
Not an ounce of fat on it.

987
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,951
-What?
-Don't worry. I like yours better.

988
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:30,370
I got two queens, two jacks
and an ace.

989
00:54:30,625 --> 00:54:32,202
-I win.
-Why do you win?

990
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:36,374
I got a two, a four, a ten,
an eight and a six.

991
00:54:36,631 --> 00:54:38,374
I don't understand.
Why do you win?

992
00:54:38,633 --> 00:54:40,921
-Because I win.
-What's the name of that game?

993
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:41,959
I win.

994
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:43,500
I'll get it!

995
00:54:45,806 --> 00:54:48,048
-What's up?
-I'm looking for Kevin Gerrity.

996
00:54:48,309 --> 00:54:49,969
He's in China. Who are you?

997
00:54:50,228 --> 00:54:53,762
Arthur Brooks, New York City
Social Services. I'm confused.

998
00:54:54,023 --> 00:54:56,644
Chinatown. He loves those egg rolls.

999
00:54:56,984 --> 00:55:00,899
I've tried contacting him several times
and he hasn't responded.

1000
00:55:01,155 --> 00:55:02,400
I'm concerned.

1001
00:55:02,657 --> 00:55:04,448
Ixnay on the ketchupnay.

1002
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,610
-Have him call me.
-All right.

1003
00:55:08,037 --> 00:55:09,946
My body's definitely better than his.

1004
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:12,033
Without question.

1005
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:19,960
It took you a long time to pencil me in.
You work all the time.

1006
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:21,414
I know. I'm excited.

1007
00:55:21,676 --> 00:55:24,214
You're excited.
How long you been this crazy?

1008
00:55:25,847 --> 00:55:28,516
I guess ever since
I was a little girl.

1009
00:55:29,308 --> 00:55:33,686
See, my mom got married really young
and pretty much just raised us kids.

1010
00:55:34,105 --> 00:55:35,765
So when my dad took off...

1011
00:55:36,023 --> 00:55:38,479
...she wasn't left
with a lot of options.

1012
00:55:38,734 --> 00:55:41,735
And I think that's when I decided...

1013
00:55:41,988 --> 00:55:44,561
...that I never wanted to end up
in that situation.

1014
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:47,779
That's actually a good reason
to be working.

1015
00:55:48,035 --> 00:55:51,819
I guess I feel like I gotta kick ass
while there's ass to be kicked.

1016
00:55:52,081 --> 00:55:56,245
You kick that ass during the day,
but at night you have fun with Sonny.

1017
00:55:57,253 --> 00:56:01,547
The Best of Times

1018
00:56:02,842 --> 00:56:07,053
Are when I'm alone with you

1019
00:56:09,682 --> 00:56:13,514
Some rain, some shine

1020
00:56:21,485 --> 00:56:26,064
Two guys you were best friends with in
law school fell in love with each other?

1021
00:56:26,324 --> 00:56:27,652
Is that strange for you?

1022
00:56:27,909 --> 00:56:29,818
No. Nothing changed, really.

1023
00:56:30,077 --> 00:56:33,363
They watch a different kind
of porno now. But that's it.

1024
00:56:36,042 --> 00:56:37,999
My God! This is Corinne's place?

1025
00:56:38,252 --> 00:56:40,826
If the girls at Hooters
could see her now.

1026
00:56:41,088 --> 00:56:45,217
-Do you want your ass kicked?
-I'm just kidding around, Layla.

1027
00:56:49,597 --> 00:56:53,096
You're afraid to get involved
and you got a lot of work, but...

1028
00:56:53,684 --> 00:56:57,764
...when I'm not with you, I'm thinking
of you. Do you have that going on?

1029
00:56:58,105 --> 00:56:59,101
Maybe.

1030
00:56:59,357 --> 00:57:01,848
Maybe we should try a kiss out.

1031
00:57:02,109 --> 00:57:06,439
We owe it to ourselves to see
if we should move to the next level.

1032
00:57:07,365 --> 00:57:08,823
I'm not sure.

1033
00:57:09,075 --> 00:57:12,076
Me either. It's just that
you kissed Scuba Steve.

1034
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:14,901
Ever since then,
he's strutted around bragging...

1035
00:57:15,164 --> 00:57:19,411
..." I got a kiss the first night.
After three times, you got nothing."

1036
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:20,867
-He said that?
-Come on.

1037
00:57:21,128 --> 00:57:24,462
Let's just give it a shot
just so I can have some dignity.

1038
00:57:24,715 --> 00:57:26,044
All right?

1039
00:57:33,224 --> 00:57:35,133
Oh, my God!

1040
00:57:35,393 --> 00:57:36,721
Gross!

1041
00:57:36,978 --> 00:57:38,436
Did I witness the first kiss?

1042
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:41,226
Yeah, you did.
Thanks a lot for showing up.

1043
00:57:41,899 --> 00:57:44,900
Layla, you didn't actually
enjoy that, did you?

1044
00:57:45,152 --> 00:57:47,690
I don't know. I'm going upstairs.

1045
00:57:47,947 --> 00:57:50,070
Wash your mouth out. He's dirty.

1046
00:57:50,324 --> 00:57:51,902
And he's poor.

1047
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:56,157
What do you got in the bag, Corinne?
Some chicken wings? Booby tassels?

1048
00:57:56,497 --> 00:57:57,411
Shut up.

1049
00:57:57,665 --> 00:57:59,124
You have a good sleep.

1050
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:00,953
Pleasant Hooters.

1051
00:58:05,631 --> 00:58:07,423
Come on, come on!

1052
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,627
This is where we hang our jackets.

1053
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,000
This is my hook.

1054
00:58:11,262 --> 00:58:12,590
That's a capertillar.

1055
00:58:12,847 --> 00:58:13,962
A caterpillar.

1056
00:58:14,223 --> 00:58:17,592
-That's right, a capertillar.
-Capertillar, all right.

1057
00:58:17,852 --> 00:58:19,429
-Staying clean, pal?
-Yes.

1058
00:58:19,687 --> 00:58:22,641
You drink the booze, you lose.
Remember that, punk.

1059
00:58:24,275 --> 00:58:26,351
I'm Julian's teacher, Ms. Foote.

1060
00:58:26,611 --> 00:58:28,687
-You his father?
-I'm Kevin Gerrity.

1061
00:58:28,946 --> 00:58:32,695
Do you have some time to go over some
things that have been bothering me?

1062
00:58:33,242 --> 00:58:34,108
Sure.

1063
00:58:34,368 --> 00:58:36,160
Go take a walk, pal.

1064
00:58:36,496 --> 00:58:39,449
Julian has been displaying
some odd behaviour.

1065
00:58:39,707 --> 00:58:42,957
He spilled glue on the floor
and didn't tell anyone.

1066
00:58:43,211 --> 00:58:44,835
He covered it with newspaper.

1067
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:50,007
And then one of our students wore
Rollerblades for show-and-tell.

1068
00:58:50,259 --> 00:58:52,797
And Julian tripped him with a stick.

1069
00:58:53,137 --> 00:58:54,133
I've never--

1070
00:58:56,807 --> 00:58:58,634
Julian found it hilarious.

1071
00:58:58,893 --> 00:59:01,218
I like him to express himself freely.

1072
00:59:01,479 --> 00:59:04,480
I've really never seen
any problems with that.

1073
00:59:08,402 --> 00:59:11,653
Your boy's making the least progress
of any of the children.

1074
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,940
Frankly, his personal hygiene
is becoming a cause for concern.

1075
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:19,826
He's the smelly kid in class?
I let him become the smelly kid?

1076
00:59:20,081 --> 00:59:21,243
What's wrong with me?

1077
00:59:21,499 --> 00:59:23,408
I've had some smelly ones before.

1078
00:59:23,668 --> 00:59:26,040
But your son is by far the smelliest.

1079
00:59:26,295 --> 00:59:29,082
All right, I got you.
What do you think I should do?

1080
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:32,009
Start by paying more attention
to his schoolwork.

1081
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:36,051
The class is giving a presentation
of the Founding Fathers.

1082
00:59:36,305 --> 00:59:40,385
Julian has drawn the part of Benjamin
Franklin, a very important role.

1083
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:41,841
Do what you can to help.

1084
00:59:42,103 --> 00:59:44,808
I will turn this all around.
That's a promise.

1085
00:59:45,064 --> 00:59:46,439
Thank you very much.

1086
00:59:46,691 --> 00:59:49,098
Stinky, let's go.
You got us in trouble.

1087
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:50,640
Did he call him "Stinky"?

1088
00:59:54,073 --> 00:59:56,742
Wow, I didn't know this
about George Washington.

1089
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:59,365
Yes, his teeth were made of wool.

1090
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,198
Wood.

1091
01:00:02,123 --> 01:00:03,866
I sorry. I mix up " D" and " L."

1092
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:05,323
Well, get it right.

1093
01:00:07,128 --> 01:00:08,752
Turn that game off, pal.

1094
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:10,285
I got four guys left.

1095
01:00:10,548 --> 01:00:12,042
Let's study a little bit.

1096
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,462
I don't wanna study.

1097
01:00:13,718 --> 01:00:14,667
Give me that.

1098
01:00:15,761 --> 01:00:18,679
-You just killed me.
-So what? You'll play later.

1099
01:00:18,931 --> 01:00:20,509
You can't tell me what to do.

1100
01:00:20,766 --> 01:00:24,681
Really? Let's take a vote.
Who thinks the kid should study?

1101
01:00:26,063 --> 01:00:29,183
Who doesn't?
Well, you just lost, two to one.

1102
01:00:29,442 --> 01:00:32,692
It's a tie. That guy doesn't count.
He can't even read.

1103
01:00:34,071 --> 01:00:36,111
I know. He was just joking around.

1104
01:00:36,908 --> 01:00:40,407
Can you hang out here a little bit?
I gotta go do something.

1105
01:00:40,661 --> 01:00:41,824
No problem.

1106
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:44,581
Would you like

1107
01:00:46,667 --> 01:00:48,459
We'll hop, hop, hop, hop

1108
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:50,419
What do you say

1109
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:53,542
Get the door.

1110
01:01:00,389 --> 01:01:02,014
Hi, Julian. How you doing?

1111
01:01:02,683 --> 01:01:04,391
I'm Scuba Sam.

1112
01:01:04,644 --> 01:01:06,221
Scuba Steve's father.

1113
01:01:06,479 --> 01:01:07,759
You see, my boy...

1114
01:01:08,022 --> 01:01:09,730
...needs to take a bath.

1115
01:01:10,149 --> 01:01:11,608
The only problem is...

1116
01:01:11,859 --> 01:01:13,852
...he's afraid to bathe alone.

1117
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,654
So I was wondering...

1118
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:19,404
...if maybe you could keep him company
in the tub.

1119
01:01:20,326 --> 01:01:21,108
Terrific.

1120
01:01:21,494 --> 01:01:24,448
And after the bath, you have to try
and study hard.

1121
01:01:24,705 --> 01:01:29,414
Because if you wanna be a member of
the Scuba Squad, you have to be smart.

1122
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:31,750
I could be in the Scuba Squad?

1123
01:01:32,004 --> 01:01:35,456
Well, sure. All you have to do
is work hard.

1124
01:01:35,716 --> 01:01:38,290
And don't tell a soul
about the Scuba Squad...

1125
01:01:38,553 --> 01:01:40,711
...because then everybody will
wanna join.

1126
01:01:40,972 --> 01:01:42,430
And one more thing...

1127
01:01:42,682 --> 01:01:44,924
...be nice to the delivery guy,
would you?

1128
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:48,012
It's not his fault he can't read.

1129
01:01:48,855 --> 01:01:50,562
Take care.

1130
01:01:54,569 --> 01:01:58,187
He told me to watch his boat for him.
Said that he wanted to...

1131
01:01:58,447 --> 01:02:01,117
...talk to you about
some secret mission.

1132
01:02:01,534 --> 01:02:04,025
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

1133
01:02:07,248 --> 01:02:09,573
How come I have to wear
a bathing suit?

1134
01:02:09,834 --> 01:02:11,328
I don't know the rules...

1135
01:02:11,586 --> 01:02:15,833
...with little kids and grownups
and being naked and just sit down.

1136
01:02:18,176 --> 01:02:21,545
The good news is you're not
smelling like a foot anymore.

1137
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:25,553
I read something interesting.
You know Benjamin Franklin invented...

1138
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:27,801
...bifocals? That's pretty cool.

1139
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:29,009
What are they?

1140
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:33,315
I'll show you in that book. It might
help you out with your school play.

1141
01:02:34,192 --> 01:02:35,816
We'll make this a regular thing.

1142
01:02:36,068 --> 01:02:39,188
Bathing and studying
and eating right.

1143
01:02:39,447 --> 01:02:42,068
Put your head back.
My grandmother did this to me.

1144
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:47,070
"Oh, boy. When I was a little girl,
frankfurters only cost a nickel."

1145
01:02:47,413 --> 01:02:48,528
Can you still have fun?

1146
01:02:48,789 --> 01:02:50,449
Yeah, but after you study.

1147
01:02:50,708 --> 01:02:53,709
In fact, we gotta get you
dressing differently.

1148
01:02:53,961 --> 01:02:55,503
We'll go to Barney's.

1149
01:02:56,422 --> 01:02:59,376
Not that Barney.
A more expensive Barney.

1150
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:10,803
All right, one at a time.

1151
01:03:11,062 --> 01:03:12,556
That's one.

1152
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:14,261
Two.

1153
01:03:16,108 --> 01:03:18,646
See? Urinals are good too.

1154
01:03:39,423 --> 01:03:40,834
" Electricity."

1155
01:03:41,175 --> 01:03:42,089
Very good.

1156
01:03:42,343 --> 01:03:43,506
" Constitution."

1157
01:03:43,761 --> 01:03:44,924
That's it.

1158
01:03:45,179 --> 01:03:46,377
" Philadelphia."

1159
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:47,754
Smart. Good.

1160
01:03:50,601 --> 01:03:51,550
" Fish"?

1161
01:03:53,771 --> 01:03:54,886
" Pony"?

1162
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:57,848
" Hip--"

1163
01:03:59,026 --> 01:03:59,808
" Hiphop--"

1164
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:01,649
" Hipopynonamous"?

1165
01:04:03,281 --> 01:04:06,116
Damn you! You gave him the easy ones!

1166
01:04:09,704 --> 01:04:11,079
-Thanks!
-You're welcome.

1167
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:15,699
Slow down.

1168
01:04:16,544 --> 01:04:18,252
You owe me a Sausage McMuffin.

1169
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:27,675
There's a pole there.

1170
01:04:37,273 --> 01:04:39,349
My name is Alexander Hamilton.

1171
01:04:39,692 --> 01:04:42,397
I was the first secretary
of the treasury.

1172
01:04:42,653 --> 01:04:45,025
I owned a bank and a newspaper.

1173
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:47,570
Aaron Bird shot me.

1174
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:54,028
Hi, my name is Benjamin Franklin.

1175
01:04:54,415 --> 01:04:56,988
I was a writer, a diplomat...

1176
01:04:57,293 --> 01:04:59,499
...an inventor and a statesman...

1177
01:04:59,754 --> 01:05:03,668
...although I only went to school
for two years.

1178
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:09,297
I wrote many books and invented
many things we still use today.

1179
01:05:14,101 --> 01:05:17,720
The Declaration of lndependence
is finished.

1180
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,065
Who will be the first to sign?

1181
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:24,728
-How about you, John Hancock?
-I want to sign!

1182
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:31,661
-Look at my man stand strong.
-He's so cute.

1183
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,698
What are your cards?

1184
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,669
I got a six, a five, a jack,
a four and a eight.

1185
01:05:44,131 --> 01:05:44,961
I win.

1186
01:05:45,216 --> 01:05:46,129
What do you mean?

1187
01:05:46,384 --> 01:05:48,709
I had a hand just like that.
I didn't win.

1188
01:05:48,970 --> 01:05:49,883
Because I win.

1189
01:05:50,137 --> 01:05:51,418
This is bullshit!

1190
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,305
All right. Take it easy, man.

1191
01:05:53,558 --> 01:05:55,218
Every time it's different cards.

1192
01:05:55,476 --> 01:05:56,935
So what? Relax. He's a kid.

1193
01:05:57,395 --> 01:06:00,645
There should be same set of rules,
no matter what age.

1194
01:06:00,898 --> 01:06:02,938
He's gotta learn how to lose too.

1195
01:06:03,234 --> 01:06:05,725
-Hello, Mr. Koufax.
-Mr. Brooks, how you doing?

1196
01:06:05,987 --> 01:06:07,695
I was gonna give you a buzz.

1197
01:06:08,739 --> 01:06:11,444
You just called me Mr. Koufax,
didn't you?

1198
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:13,740
It is your name, isn't it?
Sonny Koufax?

1199
01:06:13,995 --> 01:06:16,486
You held yourself out
to be Kevin Gerrity...

1200
01:06:16,747 --> 01:06:18,705
...to gain custody of young Julian.

1201
01:06:18,958 --> 01:06:20,749
Big problem in this state.

1202
01:06:21,002 --> 01:06:22,710
I've delivered to you before.

1203
01:06:22,962 --> 01:06:25,334
You always order
three pieces of cheesecake.

1204
01:06:26,174 --> 01:06:28,925
The real Kevin Gerrity
asked me to take care of--

1205
01:06:29,177 --> 01:06:30,968
Save it, Mr. Koufax.

1206
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:33,545
He has to come with me
or I'll arrest you.

1207
01:06:33,806 --> 01:06:35,051
Take out your handcuffs.

1208
01:06:35,308 --> 01:06:38,143
I don't have any,
but two policemen downstairs do.

1209
01:06:38,644 --> 01:06:40,886
Listen, Sonny, I would like to help...

1210
01:06:41,147 --> 01:06:44,895
...but my status in your country
is not what you would call legal.

1211
01:06:45,151 --> 01:06:46,230
It's okay.

1212
01:06:46,652 --> 01:06:47,684
I'm Audi.

1213
01:06:47,945 --> 01:06:50,732
Julian, you're gonna have to
come with me.

1214
01:06:52,825 --> 01:06:54,450
One second, pal.

1215
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:59,828
Would you just give me a second
to say goodbye to the kid?

1216
01:07:00,958 --> 01:07:01,954
Take a second.

1217
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:12,585
You don't want me here anymore?

1218
01:07:12,887 --> 01:07:14,714
No, that's not it, pal.

1219
01:07:14,972 --> 01:07:17,179
You just gotta go away
for a little while.

1220
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:19,889
How long am I going away for?

1221
01:07:20,144 --> 01:07:22,101
I don't wanna lie to you.

1222
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,184
I don't think we're gonna...

1223
01:07:26,692 --> 01:07:28,815
...be seeing each other anymore.

1224
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:33,150
I screwed up, pal. I'm so sorry.

1225
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:35,397
Come here.

1226
01:07:36,118 --> 01:07:37,281
Put your coat on.

1227
01:07:43,084 --> 01:07:45,491
It's not your fault, okay?
I'm the idiot.

1228
01:07:45,753 --> 01:07:47,829
-I don't wanna go.
-I know you don't.

1229
01:07:48,089 --> 01:07:50,496
But you have to,
and you're gonna be okay.

1230
01:07:53,553 --> 01:07:55,592
Please don't make me go.

1231
01:07:55,847 --> 01:07:58,219
I'm sorry, but I don't know
what else to do.

1232
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:00,930
I won't play
the kangaroo song anymore.

1233
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:02,847
Come on.

1234
01:08:03,104 --> 01:08:04,728
Just go. You gotta go.

1235
01:08:04,981 --> 01:08:06,179
You gotta go.

1236
01:08:08,025 --> 01:08:10,433
I don't wanna go. I promise...

1237
01:08:10,695 --> 01:08:13,649
...l'm sorry. I don't even
like that song anymore.

1238
01:08:13,906 --> 01:08:15,899
I know, pal. That's not it.

1239
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:19,325
But I wipe my own ass!
I wipe my own ass!

1240
01:08:21,038 --> 01:08:22,497
I know.

1241
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:44,009
-Layla, they took the kid.
-Who?

1242
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:46,761
Social Services.
I gotta get him back.

1243
01:08:47,023 --> 01:08:48,814
You said this was just temporary.

1244
01:08:49,066 --> 01:08:51,902
I can't have it be temporary.
It's gotta be permanent.

1245
01:08:52,153 --> 01:08:53,861
Okay, what can we do?

1246
01:08:54,113 --> 01:08:57,447
I filed to get custody based
on the child's best interests.

1247
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:01,449
Tommy knew a clerk, so they fast-tracked
the hearing. It's Tuesday.

1248
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:03,531
-This Tuesday?
-You got work?

1249
01:09:03,789 --> 01:09:06,790
I gotta go to Washington
for a hearing to dismiss my case.

1250
01:09:07,043 --> 01:09:08,585
Can you get somebody else?

1251
01:09:08,836 --> 01:09:11,244
I'm sorry, Sonny.
I can't. It's my case.

1252
01:09:11,506 --> 01:09:14,625
We don't even know where
this kid's gonna end up.

1253
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:18,300
Sonny, this is exactly why
I didn't wanna get involved.

1254
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:20,511
I had things going the way I wanted.

1255
01:09:20,765 --> 01:09:24,549
Then at the park, you and this kid
come barging into my life...

1256
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:27,764
...and it's screwing up everything
I had planned.

1257
01:09:28,022 --> 01:09:30,940
You think I planned on a kid
showing up on my doorstep?

1258
01:09:31,192 --> 01:09:32,734
But I fell in love with him.

1259
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:36,062
So now my plans have changed.

1260
01:10:31,169 --> 01:10:32,544
All rise.

1261
01:10:39,886 --> 01:10:43,800
We're here to determine
proper custody of Julian McGrath...

1262
01:10:44,056 --> 01:10:47,176
...also known as Julian Gerrity,
a minor child.

1263
01:10:47,435 --> 01:10:48,977
Representing New York City?

1264
01:10:49,228 --> 01:10:50,604
Ted Castellucci.

1265
01:10:50,855 --> 01:10:52,682
Arthur Brooks, Social Services.

1266
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:54,849
And representing Sonny Koufax?

1267
01:10:55,109 --> 01:10:56,188
Phillip D'Amato.

1268
01:10:56,444 --> 01:10:57,440
Thomas Grayton.

1269
01:10:57,737 --> 01:11:00,310
Plus, I'll pretty much
be representing myself.

1270
01:11:00,573 --> 01:11:01,522
Anyone else?

1271
01:11:01,782 --> 01:11:04,024
Layla Maloney, Your Honour.

1272
01:11:07,705 --> 01:11:09,745
Does this mean that you love me?

1273
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:11,493
Something like that.

1274
01:11:12,376 --> 01:11:13,835
First witness.

1275
01:11:14,086 --> 01:11:16,756
Koufax is a good egg.
He was nice to that kid.

1276
01:11:17,632 --> 01:11:19,708
But he fights like a girl.

1277
01:11:19,967 --> 01:11:20,797
You like that?

1278
01:11:21,052 --> 01:11:22,760
I'm right here, miss.

1279
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:24,803
What are you gonna do about it?

1280
01:11:26,641 --> 01:11:28,349
Are you drunk, Mr. Herlihy?

1281
01:11:28,601 --> 01:11:31,222
I had a few chardonnays. What of it?

1282
01:11:32,104 --> 01:11:33,349
Get off the stand.

1283
01:11:33,856 --> 01:11:35,137
You got it.

1284
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:37,186
I've got a few problems.

1285
01:11:37,652 --> 01:11:38,850
Off to a good start.

1286
01:11:39,111 --> 01:11:43,904
Mr. Koufax is a really cool guy.
I wish my dad was as cool as him.

1287
01:11:44,158 --> 01:11:45,818
My dad was a military man.

1288
01:11:46,619 --> 01:11:49,655
Guess I wasn't such a "good soldier."

1289
01:11:50,081 --> 01:11:54,873
When I was 35, he attempted to give me
a crew cut while I was sleeping.

1290
01:11:55,169 --> 01:11:57,625
I broke his arm,
haven't seen him since.

1291
01:11:58,214 --> 01:12:01,131
I'd rather live on the streets
than under his rules.

1292
01:12:07,849 --> 01:12:12,142
Anyway, I think Mr. Koufax should be
acquitted of all the charges.

1293
01:12:13,312 --> 01:12:17,180
If O.J. can get away with murder,
why can't Sonny have his kid?

1294
01:12:18,609 --> 01:12:20,685
This guy knows what I'm talking about.

1295
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:24,697
No more questions.

1296
01:12:28,244 --> 01:12:30,817
How long have you delivered food
to Mr. Koufax?

1297
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,740
I deliver food for six years.

1298
01:12:32,999 --> 01:12:36,000
Plus, I'm stripper.
But I've put on weight so it's problem.

1299
01:12:36,252 --> 01:12:40,332
I see. And in your experience,
was Sonny a good father to Julian?

1300
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:43,259
Oh, yes. They make terrific pair.

1301
01:12:43,509 --> 01:12:45,965
They went together like
lamb and tuna fish.

1302
01:12:47,763 --> 01:12:49,341
Lamb and tuna fish?

1303
01:12:49,974 --> 01:12:53,509
Spaghetti and meatball?
You more comfortable with that analogy?

1304
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:55,976
Yes, considering we're in America.

1305
01:12:56,230 --> 01:12:58,804
If you don't like spaghetti
and meatballs, get out.

1306
01:12:59,066 --> 01:13:00,525
I'll come give you a crew cut.

1307
01:13:00,818 --> 01:13:02,147
Let's see your clippers.

1308
01:13:02,403 --> 01:13:04,194
Not my problem your dad was sick.

1309
01:13:06,574 --> 01:13:08,116
Stop yelling at me!

1310
01:13:11,245 --> 01:13:13,736
Order! Order! Order!

1311
01:13:13,998 --> 01:13:15,492
Am I in the right room?

1312
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:16,829
Who the hell are you?

1313
01:13:17,084 --> 01:13:18,744
I'm Mr. Koufax's co-counsel.

1314
01:13:19,003 --> 01:13:20,663
He has enough co-counsels.

1315
01:13:20,922 --> 01:13:21,752
Well...

1316
01:13:23,841 --> 01:13:25,039
...one more won't hurt.

1317
01:13:25,301 --> 01:13:26,676
Let's get on with it.

1318
01:13:26,928 --> 01:13:29,929
Mr. Koufax is simply parading
his buddies up there.

1319
01:13:30,181 --> 01:13:32,553
Can't they find someone
who isn't a friend?

1320
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:35,050
What were Julian
and Mr. Koufax doing?

1321
01:13:35,436 --> 01:13:36,266
Shopping.

1322
01:13:36,521 --> 01:13:39,356
Did he appear to be
an attentive, loving father?

1323
01:13:39,607 --> 01:13:41,066
He certainly did.

1324
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,607
And how long have you
disliked Mr. Koufax?

1325
01:13:43,861 --> 01:13:45,059
Since the day I met him.

1326
01:13:45,321 --> 01:13:48,405
For the record, where did you work
during medical school?

1327
01:13:49,909 --> 01:13:51,237
Hooters.

1328
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,864
No further questions.

1329
01:13:55,957 --> 01:13:57,237
Asshole.

1330
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,745
Next witness.

1331
01:13:59,377 --> 01:14:01,369
We'd like to call Julian McGrath.

1332
01:14:15,351 --> 01:14:18,637
If it's okay with you,
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

1333
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:20,723
This is just you and me talking...

1334
01:14:20,982 --> 01:14:23,021
...so don't pay attention to
these people.

1335
01:14:23,276 --> 01:14:25,315
Can you tell me how old you are?

1336
01:14:27,113 --> 01:14:28,737
Your Honour, one second.

1337
01:14:41,836 --> 01:14:43,496
That's better, huh?

1338
01:14:43,754 --> 01:14:45,414
Can you tell me
how old you are?

1339
01:14:45,798 --> 01:14:46,961
Five.

1340
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:48,497
What's your birthday?

1341
01:14:48,759 --> 01:14:50,419
July 1 5th.

1342
01:14:50,678 --> 01:14:51,757
Where were you born?

1343
01:14:52,013 --> 01:14:53,044
Toronto.

1344
01:14:53,306 --> 01:14:55,713
Toronto? I thought you were
from Buffalo.

1345
01:14:56,142 --> 01:14:58,811
I moved to Buffalo with my mommy.

1346
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:02,146
For the past six weeks, you've been
living with Sonny?

1347
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:05,858
Did you and Sonny have fun?

1348
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:08,980
What kind of things would you do?

1349
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:13,153
He taught me how to do the sleeper hold
like Chief Jay Strongbow.

1350
01:15:13,701 --> 01:15:14,981
That's nice.

1351
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:16,275
Anything else?

1352
01:15:16,537 --> 01:15:18,826
He taught me how to pee on a building.

1353
01:15:19,373 --> 01:15:20,369
Really?

1354
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:28,630
And he taught me that Styx was
one of the greatest American rock bands.

1355
01:15:28,883 --> 01:15:30,626
They only caught a bad rap...

1356
01:15:30,885 --> 01:15:34,336
...because most critics
are cynical assholes.

1357
01:15:37,016 --> 01:15:39,056
I think we'd all agree with that.

1358
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:45,481
Before you came here, do you remember
the last thing your mommy said to you?

1359
01:15:45,733 --> 01:15:49,268
That she loved me and I was gonna
live with my new daddy.

1360
01:15:49,529 --> 01:15:52,399
If your mother could pick anyone
to be your new daddy...

1361
01:15:52,657 --> 01:15:53,902
...who would she pick?

1362
01:15:54,158 --> 01:15:55,736
Sonny.

1363
01:15:56,702 --> 01:15:57,900
Thank you, Julian.

1364
01:15:58,162 --> 01:15:59,538
You can step down now.

1365
01:16:04,544 --> 01:16:06,204
That went good, don't you think?

1366
01:16:06,504 --> 01:16:09,458
I don't know.
Judge doesn't look too happy.

1367
01:16:09,715 --> 01:16:12,171
Mr. Koufax, anyone else?

1368
01:16:16,931 --> 01:16:19,256
I'd like to call upon myself,
Your Honour.

1369
01:16:19,517 --> 01:16:20,715
Awesome.

1370
01:16:20,977 --> 01:16:24,096
Which of your esteemed co-counsels
will examine you?

1371
01:16:26,065 --> 01:16:28,390
My father, Lenny Koufax.

1372
01:16:28,651 --> 01:16:29,766
What?

1373
01:16:30,236 --> 01:16:31,611
Forget it, Sonny.

1374
01:16:31,863 --> 01:16:33,273
What is going on?

1375
01:16:33,531 --> 01:16:37,778
Nobody in this world thinks I shouldn't
have a child more than that man.

1376
01:16:38,161 --> 01:16:41,612
He also happens to be
a well-respected lawyer in Florida.

1377
01:16:41,873 --> 01:16:46,001
If I can make a believer out of him,
I can make a believer out of everybody.

1378
01:16:46,252 --> 01:16:50,748
This court is after the truth, not
the opinion of the defendant's father.

1379
01:16:51,007 --> 01:16:53,332
You want my opinion?
My son is a moron.

1380
01:16:53,593 --> 01:16:55,965
I withdraw my objection.
Please proceed.

1381
01:17:00,975 --> 01:17:02,600
This is a big mistake.

1382
01:17:03,102 --> 01:17:06,518
I only came today to make sure
you didn't end up in jail.

1383
01:17:06,772 --> 01:17:08,564
That was nice of you. Thank you.

1384
01:17:08,816 --> 01:17:11,651
To do what I think is right here.

1385
01:17:11,903 --> 01:17:14,394
Cut your fingernails.
They're too long.

1386
01:17:14,655 --> 01:17:15,604
Okay, Dad.

1387
01:17:15,865 --> 01:17:17,240
This case is simple.

1388
01:17:18,409 --> 01:17:22,952
It is absurd to think that Sonny Koufax
is ready to raise a child.

1389
01:17:23,206 --> 01:17:24,866
-Objection!
-Shut up, Tommy.

1390
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,042
Sorry, Mr. Koufax.

1391
01:17:27,627 --> 01:17:29,418
First of all, how did...

1392
01:17:29,670 --> 01:17:34,249
...this sweet little boy, Julian,
end up under your supervision?

1393
01:17:35,301 --> 01:17:38,504
I told Social Services
that my name was Kevin Gerrity.

1394
01:17:38,846 --> 01:17:41,135
-Of course, you are not Kevin Gerrity.
-No.

1395
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:42,885
-So you lied.
-Yes.

1396
01:17:43,142 --> 01:17:46,096
Like the time I found a bag of pot
in your drawer...

1397
01:17:46,354 --> 01:17:49,189
...and you said you thought
they were pencil shavings.

1398
01:17:51,651 --> 01:17:54,817
Remember when I told you Aunt Fay
was coming to New York...

1399
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:57,277
...and I wanted you to
show her the city?

1400
01:17:57,532 --> 01:17:59,987
And you said that you had
better things to do.

1401
01:18:00,243 --> 01:18:01,322
That's right.

1402
01:18:01,577 --> 01:18:05,492
I'm curious. Just what were those
better things that you had to do?

1403
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:11,830
Jethro Tull had a reunion concert
in New Jersey, so I caught that.

1404
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:16,296
What happened to Aunt Fay
that weekend?

1405
01:18:17,176 --> 01:18:18,172
She died.

1406
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:19,376
Yes, she did.

1407
01:18:20,847 --> 01:18:23,338
Did you happen to make it
to her funeral?

1408
01:18:25,142 --> 01:18:26,056
Why not?

1409
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:30,142
I went to Jones Beach,
got drunk and fell asleep.

1410
01:18:30,398 --> 01:18:31,394
Hell, yes!

1411
01:18:32,733 --> 01:18:33,896
Some role model.

1412
01:18:35,862 --> 01:18:37,190
Your Honour...

1413
01:18:37,864 --> 01:18:39,903
...my son doesn't have health insurance.

1414
01:18:40,157 --> 01:18:42,067
He doesn't know how to boil an egg.

1415
01:18:42,326 --> 01:18:45,861
He filed for social security
at the age of 30.

1416
01:18:46,497 --> 01:18:49,368
He is a drain on the economy,
on the country...

1417
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:51,369
...and most of all, on me!

1418
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:54,828
Your Honour...

1419
01:18:55,089 --> 01:18:57,378
...to give this young man...

1420
01:18:58,551 --> 01:19:02,383
...custody over another life
is not only wrong...

1421
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:03,795
...it's insane.

1422
01:19:11,731 --> 01:19:12,810
I love you.

1423
01:19:13,608 --> 01:19:14,354
What?

1424
01:19:14,901 --> 01:19:17,024
Don't be scared. It's all right.

1425
01:19:17,278 --> 01:19:18,653
I'm not scared.

1426
01:19:18,905 --> 01:19:21,989
If I get custody of Julian,
I'll be his father forever.

1427
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:26,026
That scares you because you think
there's a good chance I'll fail.

1428
01:19:26,287 --> 01:19:30,201
Sonny, it's more than a chance.
It's a certainty.

1429
01:19:30,458 --> 01:19:31,656
You're wrong, Dad.

1430
01:19:32,126 --> 01:19:36,373
You can be scared that I might get
pickpocketed in a bad neighbourhood...

1431
01:19:36,631 --> 01:19:38,504
...or break my legs skiing.

1432
01:19:38,758 --> 01:19:42,542
But don't be scared about me
being a dad, because I will not fail.

1433
01:19:43,012 --> 01:19:44,720
I love this kid too much.

1434
01:19:44,972 --> 01:19:47,428
I love him as much as
you love me, Dad.

1435
01:19:47,767 --> 01:19:50,340
I'm gonna give him advice
and I'm gonna guide him...

1436
01:19:50,603 --> 01:19:52,761
...and I'll be there
whenever he needs me.

1437
01:19:53,147 --> 01:19:55,899
I'll fly to New York to be
at his court case...

1438
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:59,021
...even if I disagree with
why he's there.

1439
01:19:59,529 --> 01:20:02,648
But, Sonny, you work in a tollbooth.

1440
01:20:02,949 --> 01:20:04,229
Don't worry about money.

1441
01:20:04,492 --> 01:20:07,659
I am in love with a beautiful girl
who makes plenty of it.

1442
01:20:07,995 --> 01:20:10,202
She'll be my sugar mama.

1443
01:20:11,499 --> 01:20:13,076
I gotta get me one of those.

1444
01:20:14,293 --> 01:20:17,828
I know this is the right thing
because I would die for this kid...

1445
01:20:18,089 --> 01:20:20,544
...just so he won't feel
one ounce of sadness.

1446
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:25,129
That's why you're here right now,
to protect me, to be scared for me...

1447
01:20:25,471 --> 01:20:27,428
...to be a good father.

1448
01:20:28,432 --> 01:20:30,721
And that's exactly what I'm gonna be.

1449
01:20:35,356 --> 01:20:36,934
Hello, Dad?

1450
01:20:37,358 --> 01:20:39,647
Yeah, I just wanted to say I love you.

1451
01:20:39,986 --> 01:20:43,355
Hi, Mom? Could you put Dad
on the phone for a second?

1452
01:20:46,701 --> 01:20:48,693
Can I borrow that when you're done?

1453
01:20:49,495 --> 01:20:50,989
Your Honour...

1454
01:20:52,373 --> 01:20:54,116
...my son deserves this kid.

1455
01:21:06,179 --> 01:21:07,839
I love you too, sir.

1456
01:21:09,849 --> 01:21:11,473
Mr. Koufax...

1457
01:21:11,934 --> 01:21:14,425
...the fact is
you kidnapped this child.

1458
01:21:14,687 --> 01:21:16,478
Not only shouldn't you get custody...

1459
01:21:16,731 --> 01:21:19,815
...but since you obtained him
by defrauding the state...

1460
01:21:20,067 --> 01:21:22,060
...you should be in jail.

1461
01:21:22,403 --> 01:21:25,854
Bailiff, remand him until
I can figure out the punishment.

1462
01:21:26,115 --> 01:21:28,024
Wait. You can't take him away.

1463
01:21:29,869 --> 01:21:32,621
As that boy's father,
I refuse to press charges.

1464
01:21:34,957 --> 01:21:37,579
Oh, God. Corinne, I'm sorry.

1465
01:21:37,835 --> 01:21:40,291
Six years ago, Joe Carter....

1466
01:21:40,546 --> 01:21:41,625
Joe Carter?

1467
01:21:41,881 --> 01:21:44,123
Toronto and the Phillies.
World Series.

1468
01:21:44,592 --> 01:21:47,000
Mitch Williams--
We flew up for the night.

1469
01:21:48,638 --> 01:21:50,180
There was a girl.

1470
01:21:50,431 --> 01:21:51,345
Oh, God.

1471
01:21:51,599 --> 01:21:54,007
I'm an idiot. I was so hammered.

1472
01:21:54,268 --> 01:21:57,435
Chicken wings, Molson 3-0.
Canadian beer is like moonshine.

1473
01:21:57,688 --> 01:21:58,803
Hell, yes.

1474
01:21:59,065 --> 01:22:01,437
You remember?
It was at that Toronto Hooters.

1475
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:07,984
That was before he met you.
That Hooters thing is a coincidence.

1476
01:22:08,241 --> 01:22:09,569
I'm sorry, Corinne.

1477
01:22:09,825 --> 01:22:13,740
I know this changes everything,
but I had to do the right thing.

1478
01:22:15,832 --> 01:22:17,160
Mr. Castellucci.

1479
01:22:19,126 --> 01:22:21,333
Pending a blood test, l....

1480
01:22:21,546 --> 01:22:22,494
Whatever.

1481
01:22:22,755 --> 01:22:27,583
The court grants custody to Kevin
Gerrity, pending the DNA test results.

1482
01:22:32,515 --> 01:22:35,551
I want you to be my dad, Sonny.

1483
01:22:35,977 --> 01:22:37,886
I know. I do too, pal.

1484
01:22:38,145 --> 01:22:42,226
But I'm not sure that can happen
exactly the way we want it.

1485
01:22:42,483 --> 01:22:45,318
Because it seems you
already have a daddy.

1486
01:22:45,778 --> 01:22:47,818
But I'll tell you what I can do.

1487
01:22:48,114 --> 01:22:51,483
I can be your friend, no matter what.
All right?

1488
01:22:51,742 --> 01:22:53,450
I'll always be your friend.

1489
01:22:53,703 --> 01:22:56,454
I'll always be your family.
I'll always be around.

1490
01:22:56,789 --> 01:22:58,367
I promise.

1491
01:22:58,666 --> 01:23:00,493
The kid's good at tying his shoes.

1492
01:23:00,751 --> 01:23:02,744
He's not great at it,
so work with him.

1493
01:23:03,004 --> 01:23:05,708
-I'll teach him bunny ears.
-What's bunny ears?

1494
01:23:05,965 --> 01:23:08,373
Make bunny ears,
cross and pull them through.

1495
01:23:08,634 --> 01:23:12,086
I go with this loop, swoop
and pull thing. He likes that.

1496
01:23:12,346 --> 01:23:15,181
-I don't know that.
-Go with the loop, swoop and pull.

1497
01:23:15,433 --> 01:23:17,141
I swear to God it's working.

1498
01:23:17,435 --> 01:23:18,597
All right.

1499
01:23:19,145 --> 01:23:23,308
Go with the bunny ears thing.
You're his dad, right? I'm sorry.

1500
01:23:23,566 --> 01:23:26,139
It's important, when you eat
at my restaurant...

1501
01:23:26,402 --> 01:23:28,525
...you never order BLT.

1502
01:23:28,779 --> 01:23:31,401
You must trust me.
Stay away from BLT, okay?

1503
01:23:31,657 --> 01:23:32,737
Hey, guys.

1504
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:35,448
I'm gonna leave you
with your dad now, Julian.

1505
01:23:35,703 --> 01:23:38,241
He's a good man.
I've known him my whole life.

1506
01:23:38,498 --> 01:23:41,368
So you two have fun
and I'll see you in the morning.

1507
01:23:41,626 --> 01:23:42,740
All right?

1508
01:23:43,002 --> 01:23:46,205
-Quit scaring the kid for a minute.
-Who am I scaring?

1509
01:23:46,464 --> 01:23:48,006
Bye, pal.

1510
01:23:52,762 --> 01:23:55,004
I went to China.
Do you know where that is?

1511
01:23:55,348 --> 01:23:56,758
It's in Asia, which is...

1512
01:23:57,058 --> 01:23:59,727
...by Europe.
I brought some cool stuff back.

1513
01:24:04,565 --> 01:24:06,558
Did you move the bench?

1514
01:24:07,443 --> 01:24:08,522
That's pretty funny.

1515
01:24:09,737 --> 01:24:12,940
You know what I got?
Some noisemakers. Check this out.

1516
01:24:14,116 --> 01:24:15,527
Wanna try one?

1517
01:24:21,249 --> 01:24:22,707
That's my foot!

1518
01:24:45,690 --> 01:24:47,065
You're nice man.

1519
01:24:47,441 --> 01:24:50,561
I've got Spice Channel.
It's blurry but it's nice.

1520
01:24:53,239 --> 01:24:55,362
Let's make this quick.
I gotta get to work.

1521
01:24:55,616 --> 01:24:58,368
Holy shit. Sonny Koufax
would rather work than eat.

1522
01:24:58,619 --> 01:25:02,831
I'm working on a big case.
I gotta sue you for making me come here.

1523
01:25:06,252 --> 01:25:07,960
Surprise!

1524
01:25:10,673 --> 01:25:13,460
Did you just waste
the good surprise on me again?

1525
01:25:15,428 --> 01:25:16,887
Hi, Corinne.

1526
01:25:17,138 --> 01:25:19,380
-Happy birthday.
-Thanks, everybody.

1527
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:21,348
Hey, you guys. How are you?

1528
01:25:21,601 --> 01:25:23,474
Happy birthday, Daddy.

1529
01:25:24,937 --> 01:25:26,182
How you doing, cutie?

1530
01:25:26,439 --> 01:25:29,190
Sonny, I beat you so bad
in basketball yesterday.

1531
01:25:29,442 --> 01:25:32,063
From now on, I have to
stop letting you win.

1532
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,312
I stopped that months ago.
He still wins.

1533
01:25:34,572 --> 01:25:36,399
That's because you suck.

1534
01:25:36,991 --> 01:25:40,075
Corinne, put a tank top on
for old time's sake.

1535
01:25:40,328 --> 01:25:42,997
-What is he talking about, Mommy?
-Nothing.

1536
01:25:44,499 --> 01:25:47,203
-Happy birthday, Sonny.
-Thank you.

1537
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:48,456
It's a clock radio.

1538
01:25:48,711 --> 01:25:50,953
-Thanks for telling me.
-I have to split.

1539
01:25:51,214 --> 01:25:52,328
I got deliveries.

1540
01:25:52,590 --> 01:25:54,547
Hang out with us. We'll have fun.

1541
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:57,801
No, I can't stay.
I'll hang for a little bit.

1542
01:25:58,054 --> 01:26:00,426
There you go. Come on,
let's eat, everybody.

1543
01:26:00,681 --> 01:26:02,970
Hey, you! Still missing
that tooth, huh?

1544
01:26:03,351 --> 01:26:04,465
Can we get some fries?

1545
01:26:06,479 --> 01:26:07,593
Vanessa.

1546
01:26:09,065 --> 01:26:10,476
You're a Hooters girl?

1547
01:26:10,733 --> 01:26:13,141
What happened to Sid's five-year plan?

1548
01:26:18,199 --> 01:26:20,191
How you doing?

1549
01:26:20,868 --> 01:26:24,783
-Maybe it's a 1 0-year plan.
-Is that the guy with the old balls?

1550
01:26:25,039 --> 01:26:25,952
I think it is.

1551
01:26:26,499 --> 01:26:29,251
Come on. I bet they're nice.

1552
01:26:32,046 --> 01:26:34,335
You're not supposed to say " balls."
Testicles.

1553
01:32:59,225 --> 01:33:00,256
