1
00:00:16,566 --> 00:00:18,955


2
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,901


3
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,870


4
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:27,573


5
00:00:54,675 --> 00:00:58,275


6
00:00:58,876 --> 00:01:04,276


7
00:03:48,577 --> 00:03:54,077


8
00:03:54,585 --> 00:03:56,077
I hope our new Commander-in-Chief...

9
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:58,643
isn't the coward they say he is.

10
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,084
Whatever they say,

11
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,120
Yamamoto is the kind of leader we need.

12
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,387
He believes in the value of the airplane.

13
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:08,826
But why a Vice-Navy Minister...

14
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,159
for such an important position?

15
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:13,595
Maybe the climate in Tokyo was detrimental to Yamamoto's health.

16
00:04:13,868 --> 00:04:16,428
The Army is against him...

17
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:18,173
for opposing their policies.

18
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:19,231
So he runs away to sea.

19
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:26,241
Now he has the entire fleet to guard him.

20
00:05:02,223 --> 00:05:08,223


21
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:11,887


22
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:01,991


23
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:51,781
This order makes you Commander-in-Chief.

24
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:54,165
The Imperial fleet consists of--

25
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:57,120
Save your breath, Yoshida.

26
00:06:57,266 --> 00:06:59,462
Those details are in the documents.

27
00:06:59,702 --> 00:07:01,192
You haven't changed!

28
00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:05,270
With the Army controlling politics...

29
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,037
...your job as Navy Minister will be difficult.

30
00:07:08,111 --> 00:07:09,100
Don't mess it up

31
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:11,440
Thank God you're here.

32
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,873
We know your life has been threatened.

33
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,519
I'm not that easy to kill.

34
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:22,286
Army hotheads are demanding

35
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:25,381
an alliance with Germany.

36
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,626
That would be tragic for Japan.

37
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:34,831
As Navy Minister l will continue to fight with the Army.

38
00:07:36,506 --> 00:07:38,997
You are our last hope, Yoshida.

39
00:07:40,143 --> 00:07:42,941
The Navy must stand firm against the alliance.

40
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:54,390


41
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:58,915
America is against the war we are waging in China...

42
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,647
...and angry that we are negotiating with the Germans.

43
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:08,394
Now we are threatened with an embargo of the raw materials we need.

44
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,934
Either we improve relations with the U.S. ...

45
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:16,505
and withdraw from China

46
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:22,208
...or find another source of raw materials here in Indo-China.

47
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:25,740
Why worry about threats from America?

48
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:30,222
President Roosevelt's attention is on Europe...

49
00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:32,884
...where Germany is winning a quick victory over the Allied Armies.

50
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,393
So I think we don't have to withdraw our force...

51
00:08:34,464 --> 00:08:35,658
from China

52
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,659


53
00:08:40,069 --> 00:08:42,196
Now is the time to strike.

54
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:49,268
The British, the Dutch and the French are withdrawing their forces...

55
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,478
...from Southeast Asia ...

56
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:57,210
to strengthen their armies in Europe.

57
00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:01,379
We must be careful.

58
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:08,382
The Americans have an Army in the Philippines...

59
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:11,222
...and they have moved ...

60
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:16,127
their Pacific Fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor

61
00:09:18,977 --> 00:09:24,704
Yes, and that fleet is a knife leveled at Japan's throat.

62
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:29,005


63
00:09:31,006 --> 00:09:38,806


64
00:09:46,907 --> 00:09:50,207


65
00:09:56,007 --> 00:09:58,107


66
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:10,112
The Japanese ambassador just arrived. He should be up shortly.

67
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,758
Thank you.

68
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:14,059


69
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:18,908
The Japanese are stalling, Henry.You know that.

70
00:10:20,803 --> 00:10:23,566
When Nomura took over as ambassador...

71
00:10:24,443 --> 00:10:26,039
... l had some hopes of settling our differences.

72
00:10:27,447 --> 00:10:30,803
But our meetings so far have been unproductive.

73
00:10:31,084 --> 00:10:34,639
He brings me proposals,I offer compromises.

74
00:10:35,756 --> 00:10:37,485
He brings me counterproposals, and so on.

75
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:43,236
I tell you, Henry, Nomura was sent here to buy time.

76
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:46,937
That's what he's doing, at our expense.

77
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,960
The president believes him to be...

78
00:10:51,158 --> 00:10:54,458
...a man we can trust and deal with.

79
00:10:57,305 --> 00:11:00,170
Mr. Ambassador, we meet again.

80
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,035
It is always a pleasure.

81
00:11:03,178 --> 00:11:06,770
I assume you know Mr. Stimson, the head of our War Department.

82
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:09,004
Oh, yes, of course.

83
00:11:09,284 --> 00:11:10,810
Mr. Ambassador.

84
00:11:11,753 --> 00:11:17,449
I do hope, Mr. Stimson your presence here does not indicate anything ominous.

85
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:18,482
Of course not, Mr. Nomura.

86
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,162
Mr. Nomura, won't you please sit down?

87
00:11:21,372 --> 00:11:22,914
Thank you.

88
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:31,125
Well, since our last talk a week ago...

89
00:11:31,974 --> 00:11:39,414
... l have received certain shall we say questions from my government...

90
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:43,612
...to put to you to clarify certain matters.

91
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:54,513


92
00:12:04,373 --> 00:12:05,271
Good morning, colonel.

93
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,738
There it is.

94
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:19,612
This machine lets us intercept every word between Tokyo...

95
00:12:19,921 --> 00:12:21,749
...and all Japanese embassies.

96
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:25,120
The coded material is fed into that machine.

97
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:30,993
It goes round and round in there...

98
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:35,028
...and comes out here, decoded in Japanese.

99
00:12:35,438 --> 00:12:37,633
All we have to do is translate it.

100
00:12:41,378 --> 00:12:42,840
We decode this quicker than the Japanese embassy...

101
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,773
...right here in Washington.

102
00:12:45,871 --> 00:12:48,371


103
00:12:48,885 --> 00:12:51,149
No wonder you decided to call it "Operation Magic."

104
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,623
- The latest intercept, sir. - Thank you.

105
00:13:02,098 --> 00:13:05,628
Things are getting a little hotter in the Pacific.

106
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,342
As long as we're sharing this assignment...

107
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:19,675
...take a look at this.

108
00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:27,509
Behold the 12 apostles.

109
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,450
The chosen few are authorized to see the magic intercepts.

110
00:13:32,628 --> 00:13:36,155
Hap Arnold, Chief of the Air Corps, isn't on the list.

111
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:37,429
No,

112
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:40,529
and not one of our overseas commanders.

113
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,850
fire

114
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:24,372
Excellent!

115
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:34,316
Who is in command of those torpedo planes?

116
00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:37,952
Lt. Commander Fuchida, sir, from the carrier Akagi.

117
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:40,993
Send him this message from me.

118
00:14:41,397 --> 00:14:43,820
"Congratulations on brilliant torpedo attack."

119
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,411
lf we are forced into a war with America...

120
00:15:09,358 --> 00:15:11,087
...Japan's only hope...

121
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,989
...is to annihilate the American Pacific fleet at the outset.

122
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:21,166
I wonder if we could use torpedo planes at Pearl Harbor?

123
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:28,367
Pearl Harbor

124
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:34,212
Stand by.

125
00:15:37,518 --> 00:15:38,450
Execute.

126
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,957
Look at that entrance to the harbor.

127
00:15:59,373 --> 00:16:05,300
Sink one good-sized ship in the channel and you've bottled up our whole fleet.

128
00:16:05,546 --> 00:16:08,310
You know as well as l do,

129
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:10,244
this harbor is a mousetrap.

130
00:16:11,385 --> 00:16:13,717
Fleet should have stayed in San Diego where it belongs.

131
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:18,946
I made the mistake to point that out to Roosevelt.

132
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,983
We're expected to obey orders.

133
00:16:22,897 --> 00:16:25,729
We're also expected to exercise our own good judgment.

134
00:16:27,401 --> 00:16:28,800
I didn't ask for the job.

135
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:34,734
Sorry, Kim, but this was my command, and it's become habit...

136
00:16:35,006 --> 00:16:37,573
...to worry about the security of the fleet.

137
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:42,140
The British, flying some old biplanes...

138
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,643
...torpedoed and sank three ltalian battleships at Taranto.

139
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:47,884
Harbor very much like this one.

140
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:49,185
yeah

141
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:53,594
I share your concern, but CNO doesn't think it can happen here.

142
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,254
Why not?

143
00:16:55,796 --> 00:17:01,393
A torpedo dropped from a plane plunges...to a depth of 75 feet or more before it levels off.

144
00:17:01,802 --> 00:17:03,929
I know, and Pearl is only 40 feet deep.

145
00:17:06,374 --> 00:17:07,466
I'm still worried, Kim.

146
00:17:16,617 --> 00:17:21,845
Frankly, sir, l was stunned when l heard of your proposal.

147
00:17:22,723 --> 00:17:24,554
You think the plan is reckless?

148
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,788
You suggest using torpedo planes against the American Fleet...

149
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,291
...but Pearl Harbor is too shallow for that.

150
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:33,694
Taranto is also a shallow harbor...

151
00:17:34,268 --> 00:17:36,429
...but the British torpedoed ...

152
00:17:36,504 --> 00:17:38,893
and sank three ltalian battleships there.

153
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:42,601
I know as well as you do that my plan is a gamble.

154
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:44,133
And it's risky,

155
00:17:44,946 --> 00:17:48,870
but we have no choice.

156
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:53,246
What l need immediately is a plan for such an attack.

157
00:17:54,355 --> 00:17:55,617
I understand

158
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:58,488
Then we should consult with Genda...

159
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,522
Genda?

160
00:18:00,962 --> 00:18:01,951
...the new Air Staff Officer on the Akagi,

161
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:04,824
a superb strategist.

162
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,999
Yes, l remember Genda. We'll talk to him.

163
00:18:20,903 --> 00:18:24,803


164
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:44,865
Glad to see you, Genda.

165
00:18:45,406 --> 00:18:47,397
So this is the new Zero?

166
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:50,404
Type 21, with folding wings.

167
00:18:53,247 --> 00:18:55,805
This means we can carry more fighters now.

168
00:18:56,751 --> 00:19:00,679
This Zero is fast, maneuverable and has a long cruising range.

169
00:19:01,823 --> 00:19:03,785
Better than the Messerschmitt or Spitfire?

170
00:19:04,175 --> 00:19:07,493
Definitely. I've seen both in combat over London.

171
00:19:07,895 --> 00:19:09,480
You outrank me, so it must be true.

172
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:14,697
Now that you're Staff Officer here,

173
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:16,962
things will be tough.

174
00:19:18,739 --> 00:19:21,663
You don't have to worry, you won't be here.

175
00:19:21,876 --> 00:19:24,572
You're going to the Third Fleet with a promotion.

176
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,276
The Commander-in-Chief must think you're good!

177
00:19:30,618 --> 00:19:33,143
Of course he does! And I've got proof!

178
00:19:33,754 --> 00:19:36,552
Here is his telegram. Want to read it?

179
00:19:58,553 --> 00:20:02,753


180
00:20:04,285 --> 00:20:05,809
Ten-hut!

181
00:20:16,897 --> 00:20:20,927
Do the planes have to be parked like that?  Way at the edge of the field.

182
00:20:21,402 --> 00:20:23,199
Standard dispersal procedure, general.

183
00:20:23,571 --> 00:20:24,833
ln case of enemy air attack.

184
00:20:26,674 --> 00:20:29,268
There are 130,000 Japanese on this island.

185
00:20:29,977 --> 00:20:31,842
Our main problem is sabotage.

186
00:20:33,814 --> 00:20:36,180
lt'd be too easy for enemy agents to sneak in at night...

187
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:39,750
...and blow up every one of them if they're left out there.

188
00:20:40,821 --> 00:20:42,709
Make a note, Fielder, we'll have to make changes.

189
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,414
Yes Sir

190
00:20:44,592 --> 00:20:45,889
Ten-hut.

191
00:20:51,632 --> 00:20:54,190
- Yes? - Admiral Halsey's here to see you.

192
00:20:54,335 --> 00:20:55,290
Send him in, please.

193
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:03,552
Blast me, break me, court-martial me, draw and quarter me...

194
00:21:03,878 --> 00:21:07,043
...if you think they're gonna send my ships...

195
00:21:07,181 --> 00:21:09,373
...on convoy duty in the Atlantic.

196
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,316
Kim, l think they've gone nuts in Washington.

197
00:21:12,453 --> 00:21:14,842
How will l fight a task force if they send...

198
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:16,775
...my ships to the Atlantic?

199
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:20,444
That damn ocean is a swimming hole compared to the Pacific.

200
00:21:20,861 --> 00:21:22,952
What are we, a fighting fleet, or are these toy boats out here...

201
00:21:23,097 --> 00:21:26,828
...so the Japs can buy them at Christmas?

202
00:21:27,635 --> 00:21:30,024
All right, Bill, now ease it off.

203
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:31,565
It's not just you.

204
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,966
They asked for some of our tankers too.

205
00:21:35,576 --> 00:21:40,589
How do they expect to feed these wagons...parked out here on this land-locked duck pond?

206
00:21:40,981 --> 00:21:43,472
You're still planning on rotating half of them at sea?

207
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,450
I was.

208
00:21:45,778 --> 00:21:49,640
Look, Kim, you've got to make them understand what's going on out here.

209
00:21:53,427 --> 00:21:55,452
I'm gonna do everything l can, Bill.

210
00:21:56,897 --> 00:21:58,660
Even go to the president.

211
00:22:01,535 --> 00:22:07,366
By God, l knew there was at least one man...in this man's Navy who hadn't gone nuts.

212
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,368
"Gandhi" is still in hiding, sir.

213
00:22:49,917 --> 00:22:54,411
A strange man, he works in his cabin like a hermit.

214
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:57,586
But he should be here.

215
00:22:58,592 --> 00:23:01,891
Watanabe, go and ask him to join us.

216
00:23:03,831 --> 00:23:08,189
When "Gandhi" concentrates on a plan, he is lost to this world.

217
00:23:11,001 --> 00:23:14,401


218
00:23:15,776 --> 00:23:19,633
Please don't bother me! This is important...

219
00:23:20,381 --> 00:23:21,609
...so I'm not going.

220
00:23:24,285 --> 00:23:27,243
Genda's plan for attacking Pearl Harbor...

221
00:23:27,355 --> 00:23:32,850
...is foolproof. It's brilliant!

222
00:23:34,228 --> 00:23:37,356
He stresses the importance of combat aircraft.

223
00:23:41,035 --> 00:23:50,296
Just think of it. We use six aircraft carriers...

224
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,211
...torpedo planes...

225
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:57,005
...high-level bombers, dive bombers.

226
00:23:57,718 --> 00:23:59,743
Zero fighters for cover...

227
00:24:00,321 --> 00:24:05,679
...go by the northern route, use the new torpedoes...

228
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:14,429
...we attack on a weekend.

229
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:19,198
Genda has thought of everything...

230
00:24:20,975 --> 00:24:23,500
...refueling...

231
00:24:25,813 --> 00:24:29,704
...the weather....

232
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:34,408
And we go on to say, "lt should be noted that Japan...

233
00:24:34,622 --> 00:24:38,046
...has never preceded hostile action by a declaration of war.

234
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,479
We have concluded it possible that a fast-rated...

235
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:45,733
...Japanese carrier force may arrive in Hawaii with no prior warning...

236
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,902
...from our intelligence service.

237
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,405
The most favorable time to the enemy would be dawn.

238
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,825
He probably would employ a maximum of six carriers...

239
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,785
...strike on a weekend.

240
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:59,709
- We recommend that the Air Corps--" - l read it.

241
00:25:00,981 --> 00:25:01,777
Yes, sir.

242
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:08,441
I appreciate the work that you and General Martin have put in.

243
00:25:09,023 --> 00:25:12,379
These reports are very useful to General Short and myself.

244
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:17,522
General Martin, you don't pull any punches, do you?

245
00:25:20,668 --> 00:25:25,368
"We recommend that the Air Corps maintain a thorough 360-degree 

246
00:25:25,368 --> 00:25:30,069
search of the Hawaiian area during daylight.

247
00:25:31,512 --> 00:25:35,869
This will require a force of 180 B-1 7 airplanes."

248
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:40,680
We can't search the sea approaches unless we have the planes, sir.

249
00:25:40,888 --> 00:25:42,879
One hundred and eighty B-1 7s?

250
00:25:45,526 --> 00:25:48,490
For God's sakes, that's more than the number existing in the States.

251
00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:54,057
It looks fine on paper, but that's not a paper fleet out there.

252
00:25:55,936 --> 00:25:57,892
Squadron from the Enterprise.

253
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:00,808
Bill Halsey's working the tails off his men.

254
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,238
Wish we had more like him.

255
00:26:06,847 --> 00:26:10,146
Makes the most of what he's got.

256
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:12,440
Doesn't keep asking for the moon.

257
00:26:28,068 --> 00:26:31,765
Well, not one bomb anywhere near the target for the past hour.

258
00:26:33,941 --> 00:26:37,297
Your pilots can see it, l suppose.

259
00:26:38,145 --> 00:26:41,243
- Who's next? - It's Anderson, sir.

260
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:49,754
Now, that's more like it.

261
00:26:50,691 --> 00:26:53,986
- Maybe your boys finally get it. - l hope so, sir.

262
00:26:55,896 --> 00:26:58,091
Who's next?

263
00:26:58,399 --> 00:26:59,923
Lieutenant Dickenson.

264
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:07,897
Tell Lieutenant Dickenson for me...

265
00:27:08,108 --> 00:27:11,703
...he couldn't hit a bull in the butt with a bass fiddle.

266
00:27:11,912 --> 00:27:12,776
Yes, sir.

267
00:27:17,918 --> 00:27:19,510
Ten-hut.

268
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,158
- Carry on. - Carry on.

269
00:27:32,933 --> 00:27:33,888
This it?

270
00:27:34,101 --> 00:27:35,033
Yes, sir.

271
00:27:35,302 --> 00:27:36,599
Our new radar.

272
00:27:36,804 --> 00:27:38,465
It's a remarkable scientific achievement...

273
00:27:38,672 --> 00:27:40,794
...capable of spotting an intruder on the sea or in the air...

274
00:27:40,808 --> 00:27:42,993
...and at quite a range.

275
00:27:43,176 --> 00:27:44,801
Now, listen, colonel, as you know,

276
00:27:44,945 --> 00:27:47,743
we're short on patrol planes.

277
00:27:48,048 --> 00:27:53,475
We're gonna have to rely on this...thing to detect the enemy.

278
00:27:53,821 --> 00:27:56,483
General, radar should do the job.

279
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:58,487
What's it doing here, not set up?

280
00:27:58,692 --> 00:28:01,683
We're about to truck it up that mountain.

281
00:28:01,729 --> 00:28:06,760
That peak up there is the ideal spot to put our main radar post.

282
00:28:06,992 --> 00:28:09,197
At that height, we'd be clear of all interference.

283
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,604
Obviously.

284
00:28:11,071 --> 00:28:12,800
But, sir,

285
00:28:12,973 --> 00:28:15,737
we can't get permission to put her up there.

286
00:28:15,876 --> 00:28:17,273
Permission?

287
00:28:17,611 --> 00:28:20,002
From the National Park Service Department of lnterior.

288
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,241
See, all of this belongs to the Hawaiian National Park.

289
00:28:24,352 --> 00:28:25,911
The Hawaiian National Park?

290
00:28:27,621 --> 00:28:31,614
Yes, sir. The Wildlife Preservation Society is raising hell too.

291
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:35,052
And we can't get permission?

292
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:37,387
No, sir. Not unless we want to fight them.

293
00:28:37,631 --> 00:28:40,327
Fight them? You're damn right we're gonna fight them.

294
00:28:40,567 --> 00:28:43,429
- Now you make a note of that, Fielder. - Yes, sir.

295
00:28:43,637 --> 00:28:46,434
Wildlife Preservation Society?

296
00:28:57,818 --> 00:28:59,774
I feel like a damn fool.

297
00:29:00,354 --> 00:29:02,845
Without even consulting me...

298
00:29:03,157 --> 00:29:06,854
...our Army has decided to occupy lndo-China.

299
00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:11,124
There is no hope for peace now.

300
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,697
I've said it before and I'll keep on saying it...

301
00:29:15,869 --> 00:29:19,000
...if we fight the Americans, we can't stop at Hawaii or Guam.

302
00:29:19,673 --> 00:29:22,301
We'll have to march into Washington...

303
00:29:22,509 --> 00:29:28,070
...and dictate peace terms in the White House!

304
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,074
Army hotheads

305
00:29:29,183 --> 00:29:31,105
who speak so lightly of war

306
00:29:31,318 --> 00:29:33,616
should think about that!

307
00:29:34,755 --> 00:29:37,280
As I'm no longer Minister of the Navy,

308
00:29:37,524 --> 00:29:39,890
I can do nothing.

309
00:29:45,032 --> 00:29:46,397
I'm sorry.

310
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:49,431
Don't blame yourself.

311
00:29:49,703 --> 00:29:51,136
The Army leaders are at fault,

312
00:29:51,205 --> 00:29:52,001
not you.

313
00:29:55,843 --> 00:29:58,368
I must get back to the fleet.

314
00:29:58,579 --> 00:30:01,776
There is a lot to be done.

315
00:30:06,553 --> 00:30:09,249
It's no use, Hal. I spoke to General Miles.

316
00:30:09,456 --> 00:30:11,412
He took it up with General Marshall.

317
00:30:11,725 --> 00:30:13,317
The order stands.

318
00:30:13,727 --> 00:30:16,855
The president is off the ultra list.

319
00:30:17,156 --> 00:30:18,429
lncredible.

320
00:30:18,732 --> 00:30:20,529
Withholding information from the president.

321
00:30:20,901 --> 00:30:24,928
Security found a copy of an intercept in a waste basket at the White House.

322
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,136
Truth is, the brass don't trust

323
00:30:28,342 --> 00:30:30,401
some men close to the president.

324
00:30:30,944 --> 00:30:33,401
Does anyone trust anyone anymore?

325
00:30:33,747 --> 00:30:36,071
- Do you even trust your own wife? - Do you?

326
00:30:38,952 --> 00:30:40,908
Come to think of it, l believe l do.

327
00:30:43,257 --> 00:30:45,213
Part two of No. 1390, colonel.

328
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,656
Tokyo to embassies in Washington and Berlin.

329
00:30:47,861 --> 00:30:49,317
Thank you, Miss Cave.

330
00:30:54,101 --> 00:30:57,400
The Japanese are moving south to occupy French lndo-China.

331
00:31:00,774 --> 00:31:02,536
- This is big trouble. - Yeah.

332
00:31:04,278 --> 00:31:06,109
Well, ultra list or not...

333
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,510
...someone has to tell the president about this one.

334
00:31:13,987 --> 00:31:18,959
"Therefore, we will impose a full embargo...on all trade with Japan.

335
00:31:21,295 --> 00:31:23,593
We do not anticipate immediate hostile action by Japan...

336
00:31:23,831 --> 00:31:26,088
...but you get this information...

337
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:30,888
...so you may take appropriate precautionary measures."

338
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:36,332
"Appropriate precautionary measures."

339
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:39,506
What the hell does that mean?

340
00:31:43,851 --> 00:31:49,084
Now, this is signed jointly by General Marshall and Admiral Stark.

341
00:31:49,656 --> 00:31:52,079
Until we know how the Japanese will react,

342
00:31:52,292 --> 00:31:54,157
we're not gonna take chances.

343
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,522
- We go on full alert. - Yes, sir.

344
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:02,693
Stark says they don't anticipate hostile action.

345
00:32:04,438 --> 00:32:07,168
Why send a warning at all?

346
00:32:07,908 --> 00:32:09,364
Damn it.

347
00:32:10,411 --> 00:32:14,541
Damn it, why can't Washington give us the full inside story?

348
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:17,373
I'd sooner form my own opinion.

349
00:32:21,054 --> 00:32:25,377
"Don't anticipate hostile action."

350
00:32:28,362 --> 00:32:30,853
Well, all right, we'll go ahead.

351
00:32:32,065 --> 00:32:33,464
lncrease air and sub patrols,

352
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:35,191
alert senior commanders.

353
00:32:35,402 --> 00:32:36,835
Maybe out of this we can find out

354
00:32:37,004 --> 00:32:38,403
how well we can function.

355
00:32:38,605 --> 00:32:39,765
yes sir

356
00:32:42,109 --> 00:32:43,133
Kaminsky.

357
00:32:43,377 --> 00:32:44,571
This is Captain Earle.

358
00:32:44,878 --> 00:32:46,470
Going on full alert.

359
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,806
Yes, captain.

360
00:32:48,882 --> 00:32:50,645
We're going on full alert.

361
00:32:50,984 --> 00:32:52,886
Notify all ship, sub and air patrols.

362
00:33:14,114 --> 00:33:19,614


363
00:33:20,615 --> 00:33:25,615


364
00:33:46,306 --> 00:33:48,501
What the hell is going on here?

365
00:33:48,709 --> 00:33:50,006
What are you doing?

366
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:53,475
Carrying out orders. General Short's concern is sabotage.

367
00:33:53,647 --> 00:33:56,536
All aircraft not ready for flight from now on...

368
00:33:56,642 --> 00:33:58,705
...will be parked in the center...

369
00:33:58,952 --> 00:34:00,613
...so they can be kept under guard.

370
00:34:00,854 --> 00:34:02,151
Suppose there's an air raid.

371
00:34:02,356 --> 00:34:05,314
They hit one plane, and it all goes up in flames.

372
00:34:05,426 --> 00:34:07,651
I'm sorry. General's orders.

373
00:34:52,005 --> 00:34:55,031
Today's war games...

374
00:34:55,383 --> 00:34:58,261
...of a theoretical attack on Pearl Harbor...

375
00:34:58,545 --> 00:35:04,711
...clearly show the need for six carriers in the attack force.

376
00:35:04,985 --> 00:35:08,347
The General Staff...

377
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:13,420
...wants to limit us to only three carriers.

378
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,022
We must have six!

379
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:20,423
lf we reduce our striking force...

380
00:35:20,469 --> 00:35:23,870
...from six carriers to only three...

381
00:35:24,938 --> 00:35:26,701
...our mission will fail.

382
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:29,004
Before attacking anything else,

383
00:35:29,076 --> 00:35:31,465
we should attack our General Staff.

384
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:37,775
We believe in aircraft,

385
00:35:38,185 --> 00:35:42,508
but they cling to the ancient theory...

386
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:45,146
...that decisive naval engagements must be fought between battleships.

387
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,987
Unless we dispel this myth...

388
00:35:48,562 --> 00:35:52,419
...we'll never get their approval.

389
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,986
They are not the only believers in the "battleship theory."

390
00:35:55,235 --> 00:35:57,629
Many officers here today also support the idea.

391
00:35:58,872 --> 00:36:00,271
I'm one of them.

392
00:36:00,974 --> 00:36:04,332
We'll soon have two new unsinkable battlewagons...

393
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:09,269
...each with a displacement of 64,000 tons and huge guns.

394
00:36:09,449 --> 00:36:11,672
Anything that floats can be sunk!

395
00:36:11,885 --> 00:36:13,443
The "unsinkable" ship is a myth.

396
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,778
The war in Europe is being decided by the airplane.

397
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,720
There can be no victory on land or sea,

398
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,217
without control of the air!

399
00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:25,281
I have been chosen to command this task force.

400
00:36:25,793 --> 00:36:28,091
And l consider this operation risky.

401
00:36:28,295 --> 00:36:30,786
How can we travel 3500 miles to Hawaii without being detected?

402
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:36,291
This mission will fail unless we achieve complete surprise.

403
00:36:37,304 --> 00:36:39,670
My ships can't carry fuel for a trip there and back.

404
00:36:40,007 --> 00:36:44,296
Stopping to refuel increases the possibility of detection.

405
00:36:44,545 --> 00:36:45,375
That's enough

406
00:36:46,113 --> 00:36:51,572
I am confident that our ships will reach Hawaii safely.

407
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,811
You are too cautious.

408
00:36:54,989 --> 00:36:57,150
The case for using six carriers is sound.

409
00:36:57,524 --> 00:37:00,816
To criticize the plan is defeatist!

410
00:37:18,145 --> 00:37:24,311
No more bickering! As long as l am Commander-in-Chief...

411
00:37:25,552 --> 00:37:28,112
...Pearl Harbor will be attacked!

412
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:35,123
I am aware that this is a dangerous gamble.

413
00:37:35,863 --> 00:37:38,593
But we can't afford the luxury of playing it safe now!

414
00:37:45,406 --> 00:37:48,000
Gentlemen, whether we adopt this plan or not...

415
00:37:48,242 --> 00:37:49,732
is no longer an issue.

416
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:54,006
Let us now decide how best to carry it out.

417
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,892
Fuchida's back! Fuchida's back!

418
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:21,234
Fuchida! What a surprise!

419
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:23,370
I'm your new Air Commander,

420
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,770
so treat me well.

421
00:38:25,446 --> 00:38:27,209
You're joking.

422
00:38:27,281 --> 00:38:29,545
How did you rate another promotion?

423
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,875
Well, exceptional people get exceptional treatment!

424
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:40,424


425
00:38:44,598 --> 00:38:47,453
This ship is crawling with Admirals.

426
00:38:48,002 --> 00:38:49,526
Something important must be happening.

427
00:38:52,238 --> 00:38:54,502
We have called you here...

428
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:57,939
...to explain the purpose of a new training program.

429
00:38:58,511 --> 00:39:03,175
This, of course, is a matter of strictest secrecy.

430
00:39:48,828 --> 00:39:51,490
It looks just like Pearl Harbor, doesn't it?

431
00:39:52,465 --> 00:39:55,161
And that area down there looks like Ford lsland, eh?

432
00:39:55,468 --> 00:39:56,594
yes

433
00:40:09,049 --> 00:40:10,448


434
00:40:15,155 --> 00:40:16,747


435
00:40:32,539 --> 00:40:33,938
Beautiful!

436
00:40:40,046 --> 00:40:44,005


437
00:40:57,831 --> 00:41:01,722
Navy pilots attract geisha girls but they frighten the fish.

438
00:41:14,814 --> 00:41:16,338
It's not an ideal radar sight,

439
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:18,608
but at least we got a permit.

440
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:20,740
Let's get the other units working.

441
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,080
Easier said than done.

442
00:41:22,322 --> 00:41:23,186
What do you mean?

443
00:41:23,423 --> 00:41:25,846
We have to get all six units adjusted and

444
00:41:26,126 --> 00:41:28,191
link them by phone to headquarters.

445
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,025
That means training men to operate ...

446
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,219
an information center

447
00:41:31,464 --> 00:41:33,796
...so they know what to do with the information.

448
00:41:34,067 --> 00:41:35,432
Take it easy, Murph.

449
00:41:35,635 --> 00:41:40,098
- You'll figure it out. - Yeah, I'll figure it out.

450
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:45,333
Don't just stand there.

451
00:41:45,578 --> 00:41:47,307
You know how to operate this thing.

452
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,569
We know the theory.

453
00:41:48,815 --> 00:41:50,840
Let's put that theory into practice.

454
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:52,045
- Switch on. - Yes, sir.

455
00:41:56,256 --> 00:41:58,850
Stay put and keep watching the screen.

456
00:41:59,092 --> 00:42:00,753
ln two hours, close down.

457
00:42:00,927 --> 00:42:02,224
I'll send a truck to pick you up.

458
00:42:02,929 --> 00:42:03,918
Excuse me, sir,

459
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,757
but what are we watching for?

460
00:42:05,932 --> 00:42:09,234
Anything unusual.  Any large blip coming from the sea.

461
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,692
Colonel, if we do spot something,

462
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:12,664
what do we do?

463
00:42:12,746 --> 00:42:15,164
Report it to headquarters, damn it.

464
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:16,904
- How, sir? - What?

465
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,475
We haven't got a telephone, sir.

466
00:42:19,911 --> 00:42:22,273
There's a gas station a mile down the road.

467
00:42:22,615 --> 00:42:24,105
They must have a phone.

468
00:42:35,161 --> 00:42:38,688
We got 183 combat planes on this base, general.

469
00:42:39,465 --> 00:42:42,793
The way they're parked now, a one-eyed monkey hanging from a balloon...

470
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:46,121
..could scatter them to hell with one hand grenade.

471
00:42:46,306 --> 00:42:47,398
Don't blame me.

472
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,039
General Short gave the order.

473
00:42:49,642 --> 00:42:51,007
Come in.

474
00:42:52,145 --> 00:42:55,433
- Sir, Lieutenants Taylor and Welch. - Okay, send them in.

475
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:05,849
You two men get in your planes and fly over to Haleiwa.

476
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,752
Yes, sir.

477
00:43:08,928 --> 00:43:11,692
What are our orders when we get there?

478
00:43:11,864 --> 00:43:13,630
Just sit tight.

479
00:43:13,965 --> 00:43:15,383
Listen for the phone. That's all.

480
00:43:15,835 --> 00:43:17,666
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

481
00:43:25,678 --> 00:43:28,909
Haleiwa is one of the subsidiary fields.

482
00:43:29,072 --> 00:43:31,899
We send those two up there,

483
00:43:31,983 --> 00:43:33,106
two more here.

484
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,651
Only way l know to disperse a few of the planes.

485
00:43:39,692 --> 00:43:40,818
lf I'd get away with it,

486
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:43,622
I'd send all to the neighbor islands.

487
00:43:43,963 --> 00:43:45,828
You know why we're being transferred.

488
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:47,398
Them poker games.

489
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,327
Been winning too often.

490
00:43:49,569 --> 00:43:50,729
Yeah.

491
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:53,998
Some sucker loses his shirt, so he bitches to the general.

492
00:43:54,073 --> 00:43:54,708
That's it!

493
00:43:55,172 --> 00:43:57,572


494
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:01,871
It's hard to believe the Emperor agreed...

495
00:44:02,482 --> 00:44:07,909
to fix a date by which the final decision must be made.between war and peace.

496
00:44:08,195 --> 00:44:12,218
His majesty's signature is a mere formality.

497
00:44:12,759 --> 00:44:17,492
The cabinet is responsible for all matters of national policy.

498
00:44:18,498 --> 00:44:23,629
The Emperor recently read a poem to his Ministers to show how he feels.

499
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:26,966
"lf all people are brethren...

500
00:44:27,408 --> 00:44:31,907
...then why are the winds and the waves so restless?"

501
00:44:34,514 --> 00:44:36,277


502
00:44:36,516 --> 00:44:39,212
"lf all people are brethren...

503
00:44:39,652 --> 00:44:43,451
...then why are the winds and the waves so restless?"

504
00:44:46,326 --> 00:44:50,217
This clearly shows how much the Emperor wants to avoid a war.

505
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:51,988
right

506
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:54,055
Yes, he has urged us to ...

507
00:44:54,133 --> 00:44:56,795
solve our differences with Washington.

508
00:44:57,303 --> 00:45:02,907
But, sir, the deadline is October.

509
00:45:03,107 --> 00:45:03,996
Can a solution be found by then?

510
00:45:05,144 --> 00:45:07,840
Perhaps. But if we fail...

511
00:45:08,021 --> 00:45:11,539
...if war does come...

512
00:45:11,818 --> 00:45:15,777
...tell me frankly, from the Navy's viewpoint...

513
00:45:15,955 --> 00:45:18,810
...what are our chances against the Americans?

514
00:45:19,826 --> 00:45:22,090
lf we must,

515
00:45:22,328 --> 00:45:24,319
we can raise havoc with them for a year.

516
00:45:24,964 --> 00:45:28,058
After that, l can guarantee nothing.

517
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:34,133
Mr. Prime Minister,

518
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,535
l hope you will continue the negotiations.

519
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:37,818
Please remember,

520
00:45:38,177 --> 00:45:40,076
there is no last word in diplomacy.

521
00:45:46,993 --> 00:45:49,493


522
00:45:54,694 --> 00:45:57,788
Tokyo has ignored my repeated inquiries...

523
00:45:59,666 --> 00:46:02,658
...and still has made no reply...

524
00:46:02,735 --> 00:46:07,627
...to the compromise proposals offered by Secretary Hull.

525
00:46:17,684 --> 00:46:20,778
The war that l have dreaded for so long...

526
00:46:22,555 --> 00:46:24,819
...may soon become a reality.

527
00:46:27,794 --> 00:46:30,422
Nomura has offered his resignation several times.

528
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:33,322
But Tokyo won't let him quit.

529
00:46:34,901 --> 00:46:35,856
lnstead they're sending a second ambassador,

530
00:46:36,069 --> 00:46:39,835
Kurusu, to help him out.

531
00:46:41,574 --> 00:46:45,203
Do you really think this Kurusu can do any good?

532
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:48,040
Well, l doubt it, Frank.

533
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:51,078
He's hardly the most tactful choice.

534
00:46:51,284 --> 00:46:53,377
When he was ambassador in Berlin...

535
00:46:53,586 --> 00:46:55,975
...he signed the Axis Pact on behalf of Japan.

536
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:59,449
You will sail from Hittakopu Bay

537
00:46:59,759 --> 00:47:02,216
on November 26 under my strict orders.

538
00:47:02,428 --> 00:47:04,350
The code, "Climb Mt. Niitaka" will be confirmation to go on.

539
00:47:04,564 --> 00:47:06,088
To Hawaii

540
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:10,770
We have tentatively set the date for the attack...

541
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:14,900
...on Sunday, December 7th, Hawaiian time.

542
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,880
But you must understand

543
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,202
that we are still negotiating in Washington.

544
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:25,215
lf a peaceful solution is found...

545
00:47:25,284 --> 00:47:27,240
before one o'clock on the day previous of  "X" day

546
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:34,251
...the fleet will be recalled at once.

547
00:47:34,529 --> 00:47:39,921
Once at sea, to turn back...

548
00:47:41,167 --> 00:47:43,055
would be a disgrace!

549
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,400
It would destroy the morale of the men!

550
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,835
They're in a high state of readiness, physically and psychologically.

551
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,170
That's what I am thinking

552
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,866
Enough! lf any commander is inclined ...

553
00:47:53,045 --> 00:47:55,339
to reject an order to return

554
00:47:55,514 --> 00:47:57,145
...when the path for peace is open...

555
00:47:57,350 --> 00:48:00,444
...let him resign now!

556
00:48:10,564 --> 00:48:14,257
Finally, gentlemen...

557
00:48:16,335 --> 00:48:18,667
...many misinformed Japanese...

558
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:23,064
...believe that America is a nation divided, isolationist...

559
00:48:24,346 --> 00:48:29,920
and that Americans are only interested in enjoying a life of

560
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:35,494
luxury and are spiritually and morally corrupt.

561
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:38,756
But that is a great mistake.

562
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:43,055
lf war becomes inevitable...

563
00:48:44,363 --> 00:48:50,893
...America would be the most formidable foe that we have ever fought.

564
00:48:54,573 --> 00:49:00,844
I've lived in Washington and studied at Harvard...

565
00:49:00,995 --> 00:49:05,071
...so l know the Americans are a proud and just people.

566
00:49:12,892 --> 00:49:14,789
- You sick or something? - No.

567
00:49:16,595 --> 00:49:19,359
I've been piecing together this batch of new intercepts.

568
00:49:20,433 --> 00:49:22,355
A frightening picture is taking shape.

569
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:27,865
Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu asked their government...

570
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:32,865
...to extend a deadline for suspending negotiation between Japan and America.

571
00:49:32,945 --> 00:49:34,507
- You remember that? - Yeah.

572
00:49:35,114 --> 00:49:39,278
Now, according to this latest intercept...

573
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:45,815
...Tokyo wants to conclude negotiations with us...no later than November 29...

574
00:49:46,158 --> 00:49:51,529
...after which, and l quote: "Things are automatically going to happen."

575
00:49:52,098 --> 00:49:55,693
Now, look at this intelligence report from the British.

576
00:49:57,536 --> 00:50:02,291
Five Japanese troop transports with naval escort...

577
00:50:02,539 --> 00:50:03,916
...were sighted off Formosa, heading south.

578
00:50:04,443 --> 00:50:05,637
We've been monitoring their fleet.

579
00:50:05,945 --> 00:50:08,334
Most of it seems to be on home waters.

580
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:10,447
I'm not so sure.

581
00:50:18,157 --> 00:50:21,456
I'd make a bet they're going to attack us.

582
00:50:23,996 --> 00:50:25,691
Japan is going to attack us.

583
00:50:28,501 --> 00:50:30,264
The 29th is only four days off.

584
00:50:32,872 --> 00:50:34,362
The 30th is on a Sunday.

585
00:50:37,376 --> 00:50:40,709
We're gonna be attacked on Sunday, the 30th of November.

586
00:50:46,419 --> 00:50:48,182
The pieces fit together.

587
00:50:52,391 --> 00:50:53,722
But can you prove it?

588
00:50:54,026 --> 00:50:57,518
No. But I'm convinced I'm right.

589
00:50:58,697 --> 00:50:59,629
Miss Cave?

590
00:50:59,698 --> 00:51:00,357
yes

591
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:01,297
Get me General Marshall.

592
00:51:01,474 --> 00:51:04,025
General Marshall's at Fort Benning, sir.

593
00:51:04,236 --> 00:51:06,124
Then get me the secretary of war.

594
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:12,343
I've got the evidence, Al.

595
00:51:14,647 --> 00:51:17,411
And I'm gonna make the brass around here admit I'm right.

596
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,917
Bratton's analysis makes sense.

597
00:51:31,464 --> 00:51:34,160
His facts are undeniable.

598
00:51:36,435 --> 00:51:40,860
Henry, I'm washing my hands of the whole matter.

599
00:51:42,208 --> 00:51:44,699
From now on, it's in your hands...

600
00:51:44,944 --> 00:51:47,469
...and in those of the Navy Department.

601
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:08,861
I'll call the president.

602
00:52:09,768 --> 00:52:13,465
A message declaring a full alert will be sent out.

603
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:18,676
Sir, General Marshall anticipated an emergency like this.

604
00:52:19,278 --> 00:52:21,405
Before he left to attend maneuvers...

605
00:52:21,647 --> 00:52:23,103
...he made out this alert order.

606
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:55,212
As you know, after the Cabinet decided to send Japan to war...

607
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,591
...they held an lmperial Conference at the palace.

608
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:05,264
His Majesty, who participated in this conference...

609
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,683
...which is a mere formality...

610
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,604
...was depressed and silent all through the meeting.

611
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:18,193
Today His Majesty will ask the customary questions about the war...

612
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:21,363
...and you will make the traditional replies.

613
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:26,493
There can be no more tragic ritual than this conversation...

614
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:30,289
...between His Majesty who does not want war...

615
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:34,168
...and Your Excellency, who has opposed it so vigorously.

616
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:39,506
As Minister of the lmperial Household...

617
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:42,801
... l am not allowed to attend this ritual.

618
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,803
Fortunately for me...

619
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,142
... l won't have to witness this tragic ceremony.

620
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,985
I can go no farther.

621
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:03,781
The Military Attach¨¦ will take you from here.

622
00:55:18,112 --> 00:55:18,840
Chief of Communication!

623
00:55:24,185 --> 00:55:25,948
Sir, a message!

624
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:30,817
Read

625
00:55:31,058 --> 00:55:35,324
"From Admiral Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief, Combined Fleet...

626
00:55:35,963 --> 00:55:39,490
...to Admiral Nagumo, Third Fleet...

627
00:55:39,967 --> 00:55:42,458
...climb Mount Niitaka."

628
00:55:45,573 --> 00:55:49,168
Hostilities will begin on December 7th...

629
00:55:52,613 --> 00:55:55,070
...exactly as scheduled.

630
00:56:02,523 --> 00:56:04,115
Read this back to me.

631
00:56:09,163 --> 00:56:12,087
"Japanese future action unpredictable.

632
00:56:12,333 --> 00:56:15,427
But hostile action possible at any moment.

633
00:56:15,603 --> 00:56:18,834
lf hostilities cannot be avoided...

634
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:22,668
...the United States desires that Japan commit the first overt act."

635
00:56:22,877 --> 00:56:25,366
Read that again.

636
00:56:27,848 --> 00:56:30,737
"lf hostilities cannot be avoided, the United States desires...

637
00:56:30,918 --> 00:56:36,919
...that Japan commit the first overt act.

638
00:56:38,526 --> 00:56:42,682
This shouldn't be construed as restricting you...

639
00:56:42,925 --> 00:56:45,720
...to a course of action jeopardizing your defense.

640
00:56:46,233 --> 00:56:48,565
Prior to hostile Japanese action...

641
00:56:49,036 --> 00:56:52,631
...you are directed to undertake reconnaissance...

642
00:56:52,957 --> 00:56:55,313
...and other measures as you deem necessary.

643
00:56:55,443 --> 00:57:00,073
These measures should be carried out so as not to alarm the civil population...

644
00:57:00,414 --> 00:57:02,177
...or disclose intent.

645
00:57:02,383 --> 00:57:04,214
By order of General George C. Marshall."

646
00:57:05,386 --> 00:57:09,618
"Not to alarm the civil population."

647
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:11,687
What do you make of it?

648
00:57:12,726 --> 00:57:17,186
Well, if you ask me, sir,

649
00:57:17,398 --> 00:57:19,195
it's double talk.

650
00:57:20,367 --> 00:57:22,892
But the chief of staff doesn't go in for double talk.

651
00:57:23,737 --> 00:57:27,095
- We're going on alert. - Again?

652
00:57:27,241 --> 00:57:30,199
But the men are confused. So many alerts.

653
00:57:30,411 --> 00:57:32,876
- Damn it, unconfuse them. - Yes, sir.

654
00:57:35,549 --> 00:57:38,946
"Japanese forces may attack the Philippines...

655
00:57:38,973 --> 00:57:41,609
...Thailand, the Kra Peninsula and Borneo.

656
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:45,152
This dispatch is to be considered a war warning."

657
00:57:49,763 --> 00:57:51,060
Well, there it is, gentlemen.

658
00:57:53,234 --> 00:57:55,657
You now have as much information as l do.

659
00:57:56,904 --> 00:57:58,929
That's the second warning in three days.

660
00:57:59,406 --> 00:58:04,529
"Japanese forces may attack the Philippines...Thailand, the Kra Peninsula and Borneo."

661
00:58:04,676 --> 00:58:05,601
They don't mention us.

662
00:58:05,912 --> 00:58:09,070
That's correct. l think it should be considered significant.

663
00:58:10,951 --> 00:58:15,935
Well, gentlemen... we have a job to do.

664
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:20,086
Washington wants us to send a squadron of fighters to Midway.

665
00:58:20,461 --> 00:58:22,588
And another squadron to Wake.

666
00:58:23,731 --> 00:58:25,494
When can you sail?

667
00:58:26,433 --> 00:58:30,062
Well, the Enterprise can sail tomorrow morning.

668
00:58:31,539 --> 00:58:35,828
I'll need a day or two. We're just completing repairs on the Lexington.

669
00:58:36,944 --> 00:58:38,832
Hurry things along, John.

670
00:58:39,046 --> 00:58:40,843
I want you out there to probe.

671
00:58:41,015 --> 00:58:43,711
I want planes up in the air morning and afternoon.

672
00:58:43,951 --> 00:58:47,512
I want a report on any sign of hostile ships.

673
00:58:47,721 --> 00:58:48,813
Understood.

674
00:58:48,989 --> 00:58:50,547
Do you want battleships along?

675
00:58:50,758 --> 00:58:52,589
Hell, no. They're too slow.

676
00:58:52,793 --> 00:58:54,784
lf we're gonna probe, let's probe.

677
00:58:54,962 --> 00:58:57,055
We don't want anything holding us up.

678
00:58:57,331 --> 00:58:58,389
You're right, but I'm not ready to commit them myself.

679
00:58:58,599 --> 00:59:03,263
Not until l know when and where.

680
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:06,428
Do you plan to keep half the fleet at sea while the carriers are gone?

681
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,437
No, it's too risky.

682
00:59:08,676 --> 00:59:12,066
I'll have to keep the fleet here at Pearl while you're away.

683
00:59:12,346 --> 00:59:15,543
Get out. Get back as soon as you can.

684
00:59:15,749 --> 00:59:19,014
I don't like the idea of having my battleships without air cover.

685
00:59:20,287 --> 00:59:23,845
- Let's get going. - Yes, sir.

686
00:59:25,088 --> 00:59:26,506
Admiral.

687
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,994
Kim.

688
00:59:35,169 --> 00:59:36,864
Level with me.

689
00:59:38,105 --> 00:59:40,801
I want a clear directive.

690
00:59:41,175 --> 00:59:42,608
lf l run into a Jap ship,

691
00:59:42,843 --> 00:59:43,832
what action do l take?

692
00:59:47,014 --> 00:59:50,040
Use your common sense.

693
00:59:52,353 --> 00:59:55,311
That's the best damn order l ever had.

694
00:59:58,525 --> 01:00:02,052
lf l see so much as a sampan there...

695
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:04,429
... I'll blow it out of the water.

696
01:00:13,374 --> 01:00:15,831
sir

697
01:00:19,346 --> 01:00:22,770
"lntelligence Report, U.S. ships now at Pearl Harbor...

698
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:25,712
...six battleships, three light cruisers...

699
01:00:25,886 --> 01:00:28,548
... 16 destroyers and one aircraft carrier."

700
01:00:30,658 --> 01:00:35,656
No information about the other American carriers.

701
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:44,541
You know today's date?

702
01:00:44,709 --> 01:00:46,460
December 1st.

703
01:00:46,628 --> 01:00:50,714
Yes, but tonight will be November 30th.

704
01:00:52,342 --> 01:00:55,969
When we cross the lnternational Date Line...

705
01:00:56,137 --> 01:00:58,681
...we'll push the clock ahead five hours...

706
01:00:58,848 --> 01:01:03,602
...and turn the calendar back a full day, making today yesterday.

707
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:07,731
Don't be silly! Today can't change into yesterday!

708
01:01:12,195 --> 01:01:16,740
You're not too intelligent but I'll try to explain...

709
01:01:16,908 --> 01:01:22,746
...so listen carefully. It's a little before 1300 hours, right?

710
01:01:22,914 --> 01:01:25,499
So why are we making supper at this hour?

711
01:01:29,337 --> 01:01:31,797
1300? lt should be lunchtime.

712
01:01:31,965 --> 01:01:37,511
Right! And the Date Line makes up for that time difference...

713
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:41,098
...by turning today into yesterday.

714
01:01:42,851 --> 01:01:47,396
I don't quite understand, but if we see the enemy across that line...

715
01:01:47,564 --> 01:01:50,774
... l guess it would be useless to shoot at them.

716
01:01:51,693 --> 01:01:56,196
Because how can today's shells hit yesterday's enemy?

717
01:02:03,744 --> 01:02:05,144


718
01:02:17,145 --> 01:02:19,375
What is it this time, getting me over here?

719
01:02:19,581 --> 01:02:22,436
Tokyo has alerted their embassy to stand by...

720
01:02:22,684 --> 01:02:25,744
...for a very long message in 14 parts.

721
01:02:27,055 --> 01:02:30,149
Look, Rufe, you scared me and everybody else last week.

722
01:02:30,425 --> 01:02:32,416
We're not doing that again, are we?

723
01:02:32,995 --> 01:02:37,914
You should see this. It's the latest report on those Japanese troop transports.

724
01:02:42,437 --> 01:02:43,961
Remember those troop ships?

725
01:02:44,139 --> 01:02:47,133
They're still heading south with an escort...

726
01:02:47,748 --> 01:02:50,042
...only 14 hours from the coast of Malaya.

727
01:02:53,148 --> 01:02:54,604
What about their aircraft carriers?

728
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:56,281
We don't know.

729
01:02:57,452 --> 01:03:00,080
lntelligence was keeping track of them until recently.

730
01:03:01,123 --> 01:03:02,556
Now we've lost them.

731
01:03:03,458 --> 01:03:07,383
Look, Rufe, try to put yourself in their minds.

732
01:03:07,796 --> 01:03:11,618
Where do you think l have been the past week, night and day?

733
01:03:12,834 --> 01:03:16,133
I am still convinced they're going to attack us.

734
01:03:17,973 --> 01:03:21,898
What can we do that we aren't doing already?

735
01:03:22,144 --> 01:03:23,441
I don't know about you,

736
01:03:23,712 --> 01:03:25,168
but l know what I'm gonna do.

737
01:03:27,149 --> 01:03:28,600
Where is everybody?

738
01:03:28,617 --> 01:03:31,750
Oh, it's past 12, sir. They've already gone.

739
01:03:31,919 --> 01:03:33,961
- Get them back. - On the weekend?

740
01:03:34,122 --> 01:03:35,384
Yes, on the weekend.

741
01:03:41,196 --> 01:03:45,155
"Only specially screened members of your communications staff...

742
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:49,129
...are to be permitted to process the 14-part message...

743
01:03:49,271 --> 01:03:53,439
...and prepare the typed translation."

744
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:02,657
It will be difficult without the help of a skilled typist.

745
01:04:03,018 --> 01:04:06,613
The situation right now is extremely delicate.

746
01:04:06,855 --> 01:04:09,153
We must be prepared...

747
01:04:09,324 --> 01:04:13,090
...to have each part of the message decoded as soon as it comes in.

748
01:04:14,229 --> 01:04:16,390
I'll alert the code room.

749
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,122
Come here

750
01:04:26,108 --> 01:04:27,040
Admiral

751
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:31,134
We'll reach Point D soon, sir.

752
01:04:43,158 --> 01:04:44,955
send out the new order

753
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,320
From Point D proceed to Point E.

754
01:04:46,528 --> 01:04:47,392
Battle speed.

755
01:04:47,596 --> 01:04:48,824
yes sir

756
01:04:51,166 --> 01:04:52,292
on starboard

757
01:04:52,534 --> 01:04:55,298
on starboard

758
01:04:55,537 --> 01:04:57,630
on starboard

759
01:05:04,279 --> 01:05:05,906
What the...

760
01:05:10,252 --> 01:05:14,848
ok

761
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:18,252
So this is the sound of Hawaii?

762
01:05:18,627 --> 01:05:19,321
yeah

763
01:05:19,561 --> 01:05:21,358
but...

764
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:31,969
The Lexington Aircraft Carrier has left Hawaii

765
01:05:32,186 --> 01:05:33,831
Disappointing news, our main targets,

766
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,986
the American carriers...have left Pearl Harbor.

767
01:05:43,852 --> 01:05:46,013
This completes 13 parts?

768
01:05:46,354 --> 01:05:49,744
Yes, Tokyo is holding the final part till morning.

769
01:05:50,592 --> 01:05:53,049
I wonder why.

770
01:05:54,596 --> 01:05:55,585
It's almost 9.

771
01:05:55,964 --> 01:05:58,990
Harry, I'm going to make the rounds with what we have here.

772
01:06:00,101 --> 01:06:03,628
Thank God the president's back on the list.

773
01:06:04,606 --> 01:06:05,834
Have Brotherhood call me

774
01:06:06,107 --> 01:06:07,506
when the missing part is in.

775
01:06:07,742 --> 01:06:08,640
Right.

776
01:06:29,231 --> 01:06:30,960
You're late.

777
01:06:31,166 --> 01:06:33,755
- Well, l was-- - Please, take me to the White House.

778
01:06:44,746 --> 01:06:46,771
lf you told me we were invited to the White House,

779
01:06:47,148 --> 01:06:48,137
l would've dressed.

780
01:06:50,652 --> 01:06:52,176
You know Mrs. Roosevelt.

781
01:06:52,354 --> 01:06:54,083
She's informal personally,

782
01:06:54,256 --> 01:06:55,780
but a stickler for protocol--

783
01:06:56,024 --> 01:06:58,288
Darling, will you shut up and drive?

784
01:07:37,699 --> 01:07:38,893
Once more!

785
01:07:46,924 --> 01:07:59,780
Steady.

786
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:07,151
Great! We just sank the Nevada!

787
01:08:13,301 --> 01:08:14,325
Pennsylvania!

788
01:08:16,471 --> 01:08:17,199
Okla

789
01:08:17,639 --> 01:08:18,503
wrong

790
01:08:18,706 --> 01:08:19,536
Oklahoma!

791
01:08:22,641 --> 01:08:24,303
Enterprise!

792
01:08:24,545 --> 01:08:26,204
No, you idiot!

793
01:08:26,447 --> 01:08:28,745
It's your own flagship!

794
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:30,941
Idiot!

795
01:08:42,797 --> 01:08:43,923
Well?

796
01:08:44,766 --> 01:08:46,199
Captain Wilkinson's.

797
01:08:52,707 --> 01:08:54,197
Did you see the president?

798
01:08:54,442 --> 01:08:58,744
No, l saw Harry Hopkins.

799
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,508
And did he read the whatever it is?

800
01:09:01,749 --> 01:09:03,979
No, he doesn't have the key.

801
01:09:05,653 --> 01:09:08,178
I gave the pouch to our Naval aide, Lieutenant Schulz.

802
01:09:08,389 --> 01:09:10,152
He took it in to the president.

803
01:09:11,292 --> 01:09:13,157
And the president has a key, I suppose?

804
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:16,692
Of course he has.

805
01:09:17,665 --> 01:09:19,553
And did Lieutenant Schulz say anything?

806
01:09:20,868 --> 01:09:22,324
He said, "Thank you."

807
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:25,134
Darling, step on it, will you?

808
01:09:32,747 --> 01:09:34,772
lf we can see nothing,

809
01:09:35,016 --> 01:09:36,972
then neither can American patrol planes.

810
01:09:37,418 --> 01:09:39,750
I'm more concerned about a submarine detecting us.

811
01:09:42,724 --> 01:09:46,421
Stand by to load the bombs

812
01:09:46,694 --> 01:09:51,449
repeat  stand by to load the bombs

813
01:09:51,699 --> 01:09:55,567
Dead on schedule.

814
01:10:04,879 --> 01:10:06,835
Admiral Stark can't be reached.

815
01:10:07,215 --> 01:10:09,103
Should l take it to chief of staff?

816
01:10:09,317 --> 01:10:10,249
It's after 10,

817
01:10:10,451 --> 01:10:13,147
General Marshall always retires early.

818
01:10:21,429 --> 01:10:26,128
I see no reason to disturb Marshall with something that's incomplete.

819
01:10:26,601 --> 01:10:30,595
- Wait till you have the final part. - Yes, sir.

820
01:10:31,906 --> 01:10:33,103
lf you're so concerned...

821
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:36,258
...why don't we call chief of war plans, Admiral Turner?

822
01:10:36,444 --> 01:10:38,400
His telephone doesn't answer, sir.

823
01:10:39,314 --> 01:10:42,543
- You don't happen to know where he is? - No idea.

824
01:10:53,494 --> 01:10:55,655
The president has already discussed it with me.

825
01:10:57,332 --> 01:11:00,460
He sent a personal message to the emperor.

826
01:11:00,768 --> 01:11:03,396
But when the final part of this comes in,

827
01:11:03,571 --> 01:11:04,936
I'd like to see it then.

828
01:11:05,273 --> 01:11:08,262
- Good night, commander. - Good night, sir.

829
01:11:17,785 --> 01:11:20,083
I was starved. I'll bet you are.

830
01:11:20,288 --> 01:11:21,653
Oh, thank you, dear.

831
01:11:25,893 --> 01:11:29,687
Can't you tell me anything?  Even a hint?

832
01:11:34,302 --> 01:11:36,224
You'd think the world was falling apart.

833
01:11:37,538 --> 01:11:39,904
Admiral Stark talked to the president.

834
01:11:40,108 --> 01:11:43,451
What did the president say?

835
01:11:46,381 --> 01:11:49,441
He sent a personal message to the emperor.

836
01:12:19,147 --> 01:12:20,136
Gordy.

837
01:12:20,481 --> 01:12:21,641
yeah

838
01:12:21,849 --> 01:12:25,273
We got those B-1 7s coming in from California in the morning.

839
01:12:25,551 --> 01:12:29,377
Honolulu radio will stay on the air all night... so the planes can home in.

840
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:32,821
You and l had better be in that control tower at 7:30 sharp.

841
01:12:33,027 --> 01:12:34,877
Yes, sir.

842
01:12:43,871 --> 01:12:47,696
- Tyler, I've got a job for you. - Sir.

843
01:12:47,809 --> 01:12:51,802
Report to the new radar center at Fort Shafter at 0400.

844
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:53,841
At 4:00 in the morning?

845
01:12:54,082 --> 01:12:55,845
From 4 to 7 a.m.

846
01:12:56,084 --> 01:12:59,178
Our marvel of science only operates for three hours.

847
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,145
Lucky boy.

848
01:13:00,388 --> 01:13:01,878
Lucky boy!

849
01:13:13,734 --> 01:13:15,099
Captain, how's it feel?

850
01:13:15,269 --> 01:13:16,793
First command, first patrol?

851
01:13:17,038 --> 01:13:18,562
Just fine, Mr. Young.

852
01:13:23,111 --> 01:13:25,773
ln fact, l think I'll turn in for a while.

853
01:13:31,786 --> 01:13:33,745
- Good night, sir. - Good night.

854
01:13:42,263 --> 01:13:45,960
The Commander-in-Chief has sent a message...

855
01:13:46,167 --> 01:13:49,159
...wishing us good luck.

856
01:13:49,871 --> 01:13:53,162
That, plus the lmperial Proclamation...

857
01:13:53,341 --> 01:13:58,043
...has undoubtedly stirred your loyalty to the Empire.

858
01:13:59,347 --> 01:14:01,372
The success of this mission...

859
01:14:01,616 --> 01:14:05,245
...depends on surprise. lf we achieve it...

860
01:14:05,586 --> 01:14:09,584
...the code words "Tora, Tora, Tora," will be sent out.

861
01:14:11,192 --> 01:14:13,422
Now that the hour

862
01:14:13,628 --> 01:14:18,258
for battle draws near...

863
01:14:18,405 --> 01:14:20,760
...I will not burden you with the usual pep talk.

864
01:14:21,769 --> 01:14:27,260
Instead I shall hoist the famous "Z" flag...

865
01:14:27,408 --> 01:14:31,833
...beneath which, Commander-in-Chief Togo led his fleet to victory...

866
01:14:32,113 --> 01:14:35,844
...in the historic battle against the Russians.

867
01:14:36,284 --> 01:14:41,415


868
01:14:57,516 --> 01:15:00,816


869
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:28,289
Here you are.

870
01:15:29,703 --> 01:15:30,431
Kramer.

871
01:15:30,637 --> 01:15:32,525
Al, listen to this.

872
01:15:32,739 --> 01:15:34,263
The 14th part.

873
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:37,903
"Will the ambassadors please submit our reply...

874
01:15:38,143 --> 01:15:40,771
...to the United States government at precisely 1 p.m...

875
01:15:41,064 --> 01:15:43,065
...December 7th, your time."

876
01:15:43,617 --> 01:15:45,505
1 p.m.?

877
01:15:45,719 --> 01:15:49,246
"Precisely 1 p.m., your time."

878
01:15:50,757 --> 01:15:52,190
I'll be right over.

879
01:16:00,791 --> 01:16:03,291


880
01:16:07,792 --> 01:16:10,292


881
01:16:10,944 --> 01:16:14,107
Look at the president's message. I should have had it hours ago.

882
01:16:14,681 --> 01:16:19,607
As you know, communications have been delayed and frequently garbled lately.

883
01:16:19,819 --> 01:16:21,446
Or deliberately interfered with.

884
01:16:24,958 --> 01:16:28,291
Gene, call the foreign minister.

885
01:16:31,097 --> 01:16:34,487
Tell him l want an immediate audience with the emperor.

886
01:16:38,471 --> 01:16:40,632
Why is this so important?

887
01:16:41,141 --> 01:16:42,870
Does this Roosevelt message say anything new?

888
01:16:52,952 --> 01:16:56,943
It merely proposes a heart-to-heart exchange...

889
01:16:57,023 --> 01:16:59,089
...between the two Chiefs of State.

890
01:16:59,893 --> 01:17:03,158
It could start negotiations afresh.

891
01:17:13,173 --> 01:17:14,868
It's too late for that.

892
01:17:17,143 --> 01:17:20,906
It's just as well the message didn't come a day or two earlier.

893
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:27,711
What do l tell Ambassador Grew?

894
01:17:28,421 --> 01:17:31,151
You are Foreign Minister!

895
01:17:31,324 --> 01:17:34,976
Report to the palace alone with the message.

896
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:44,024
"After deciphering...part 14...

897
01:17:46,523 --> 01:17:48,690
...destroy at once...

898
01:17:50,678 --> 01:17:56,601
...your cipher machine...

899
01:17:57,308 --> 01:17:58,909
...all codes...

900
01:18:00,161 --> 01:18:04,485
...and secret documents."

901
01:18:05,793 --> 01:18:07,283
Translate this immediately.

902
01:18:07,495 --> 01:18:10,147
- Give a copy to Kramer when he comes. - Yes, sir.

903
01:18:10,198 --> 01:18:11,825
I've got to get the hell out of here.

904
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,745
Hey, look at this.

905
01:19:35,349 --> 01:19:37,510
Finally got one.

906
01:19:42,356 --> 01:19:43,721
Communication center.

907
01:19:43,925 --> 01:19:44,823
It even works.

908
01:19:45,092 --> 01:19:45,854
That's great.

909
01:19:46,594 --> 01:19:49,085
Opana Point, communications check.

910
01:19:51,098 --> 01:19:52,292
Are you reading us?

911
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:53,692
Coming in loud and clear.

912
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:00,766
Where's the general?

913
01:20:00,975 --> 01:20:02,966
It's Sunday, sir.

914
01:20:17,625 --> 01:20:19,183
This is Colonel Bratton.

915
01:20:19,393 --> 01:20:21,452
Connect me with Chief of Staff, General Marshall.

916
01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:24,962
Yes, at his quarters, Fort Myer.

917
01:20:30,137 --> 01:20:32,469
Chief of staff's quarters, Sergeant Aguirre speaking.

918
01:20:34,141 --> 01:20:36,530
Yes, Colonel Bratton.

919
01:20:36,978 --> 01:20:38,900
I'm sorry, sir, the general isn't here.

920
01:20:40,414 --> 01:20:43,303
Where he always is this time Sunday morning.

921
01:21:00,468 --> 01:21:03,426
- Where's Colonel Bratton? - Gone to see General Marshall.

922
01:21:03,738 --> 01:21:05,330
He left this for you, sir.

923
01:21:06,607 --> 01:21:08,165


924
01:21:08,376 --> 01:21:11,038


925
01:21:33,968 --> 01:21:35,799
Where is the Ambassador?

926
01:21:38,906 --> 01:21:41,795
Here is another part of the message, sir.

927
01:21:51,819 --> 01:21:52,979
Mr. Ambassador

928
01:21:53,587 --> 01:21:59,949
We are instructed to submit the message at 1 :00 p.m. today.

929
01:22:01,595 --> 01:22:03,551
One p.m.?

930
01:22:05,599 --> 01:22:08,989
The 14th part of this intercept Kramer just delivered...

931
01:22:09,136 --> 01:22:11,263
...indicates to me the Japanese are going to attack.

932
01:22:13,541 --> 01:22:16,535
None of us doubt war is coming.

933
01:22:16,911 --> 01:22:19,869
We know they have an expeditionary force heading south.

934
01:22:21,349 --> 01:22:24,910
Sir, as hostilities seem imminent...

935
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:29,137
... l recommend you telephone Admiral Kimmel... in Hawaii.

936
01:22:46,874 --> 01:22:48,205
No.

937
01:22:50,411 --> 01:22:52,504
I better call the president first.

938
01:22:55,349 --> 01:22:57,510
Now, if you'll all please excuse me?

939
01:22:57,718 --> 01:23:00,180
- Yes, sir. - Thank you, sir.

940
01:23:17,705 --> 01:23:25,271


941
01:25:59,467 --> 01:26:00,627
Hurry...

942
01:26:13,948 --> 01:26:18,010
The men are in good spirits, sir.

943
01:26:18,318 --> 01:26:19,540
They are eager to go.

944
01:26:21,245 --> 01:26:26,381
Yes, they are eager because they do not know the taste of battle.

945
01:27:07,635 --> 01:27:09,159
Commander

946
01:27:09,336 --> 01:27:11,600
The mechanics asked me to give you this for good luck

947
01:27:11,839 --> 01:27:13,761
at Pearl Harbor.

948
01:27:37,364 --> 01:27:39,958


949
01:28:27,246 --> 01:28:28,997
Bring her into the wind.

950
01:32:06,298 --> 01:32:09,826
"The Japanese government regrets to have to notify...

951
01:32:09,986 --> 01:32:14,597
the American government...that, in view of the attitude of the American government...

952
01:32:15,176 --> 01:32:18,408
...it is impossible to reach...

953
01:32:18,969 --> 01:32:20,478
...an agreement through negotiations."

954
01:32:21,049 --> 01:32:22,107
Sir?

955
01:32:22,317 --> 01:32:24,308
- There are supplemental messages. - Thank you.

956
01:32:36,698 --> 01:32:37,995
Gentlemen, l am convinced the Japanese intend to attack...

957
01:32:38,199 --> 01:32:42,090
...at or shortly after 1 :00 today.

958
01:32:42,737 --> 01:32:46,332
- I'll alert all Pacific commands. - Yes, sir.

959
01:32:56,050 --> 01:32:57,938
Colonel Bratton, just a minute.

960
01:32:58,309 --> 01:33:00,909
Take this to communications center.

961
01:33:14,803 --> 01:33:15,735
turn around

962
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:17,166
turn around

963
01:33:18,072 --> 01:33:19,004
Steady

964
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:20,172
Steady

965
01:33:20,789 --> 01:33:23,403
We will follow that ship into Pearl Harbor.

966
01:33:34,255 --> 01:33:35,347
Come in.

967
01:33:36,180 --> 01:33:38,749
Captain, can you come to the bridge?

968
01:33:38,949 --> 01:33:39,974
Very well.

969
01:33:44,688 --> 01:33:46,290
Sub contact, Mr. Goepner?

970
01:33:46,801 --> 01:33:48,165
- We're not sure. - What ship?

971
01:33:48,236 --> 01:33:49,933
The Navy tug Antares.

972
01:33:51,906 --> 01:33:53,794
Look astern of her, captain.

973
01:33:54,642 --> 01:33:56,405
She's towing a target raft.

974
01:33:56,811 --> 01:33:58,767
Look between the ship and the raft, sir.

975
01:34:08,890 --> 01:34:11,188
That, Mr. Goepner, is a submarine.

976
01:34:11,392 --> 01:34:13,553
She's sneaking through the net into the harbor.

977
01:34:13,795 --> 01:34:14,921
General Quarters.

978
01:34:15,051 --> 01:34:18,125
- Sound General Quarters. - All engines ahead, full.

979
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:39,909
- Come left 15 degrees. - Come left 15 degrees, sir.

980
01:34:40,244 --> 01:34:43,278
- Tell Antares we're attacking. - Aye, aye, sir.

981
01:34:48,696 --> 01:34:50,584
Flags, tell Antares we're attacking.

982
01:34:58,262 --> 01:35:02,200
- Mount one, commence firing. - Mount one, commence firing.

983
01:35:21,095 --> 01:35:24,523
- Stand by to roll depth charges. - Stand by to roll depth charges.

984
01:35:29,404 --> 01:35:30,693
- Roll one. - Roll one.

985
01:35:39,514 --> 01:35:40,952
- Roll two. - Roll two.

986
01:35:56,097 --> 01:35:57,189
Notify Com-14

987
01:35:57,398 --> 01:36:00,561
we dropped depth charges on a sub in our security zone.

988
01:36:00,824 --> 01:36:01,824
Aye, aye, sir.

989
01:36:21,178 --> 01:36:23,087
Captain Earle speaking.

990
01:36:23,324 --> 01:36:25,155
We have a message from the ward.

991
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:26,620
All right, read it to me.

992
01:36:27,726 --> 01:36:33,022
"Have dropped depth charges on sub operating in our security zone."

993
01:36:34,316 --> 01:36:37,568
We've had so many of these false sightings, Kaminsky.

994
01:36:37,819 --> 01:36:39,570
But this is the real thing, sir.

995
01:36:39,821 --> 01:36:41,739
Closer than any previous sighting.

996
01:36:41,990 --> 01:36:43,449
Just off the harbor entrance.

997
01:36:44,451 --> 01:36:47,745
You and l know the skipper of that destroyer is a green kid.

998
01:36:47,913 --> 01:36:49,372
I'll pass it to Admiral Block.

999
01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:51,542
With all due respect, sir,

1000
01:36:51,719 --> 01:36:53,982
l think we should alert all commanders.

1001
01:36:54,288 --> 01:36:56,383
Confirmation, Kaminsky.

1002
01:36:56,690 --> 01:36:59,479
I want confirmation.

1003
01:37:22,239 --> 01:37:28,300
The sunburst reminds me of our flag,

1004
01:37:50,517 --> 01:37:52,636
Ed, this is hot.

1005
01:37:53,013 --> 01:37:56,835
General Marshall wants it sent to all commanders by the fastest route.

1006
01:37:56,995 --> 01:37:58,024
Right.

1007
01:38:02,089 --> 01:38:05,081
The generaI's handwriting, it's hard to read.

1008
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:09,956
You're gonna have to help me with it, Rufe.

1009
01:39:03,674 --> 01:39:06,981
Hey, I'm picking up Honolulu on the radio.

1010
01:39:07,103 --> 01:39:11,745
Check your direction-finder dial.

1011
01:39:12,092 --> 01:39:15,584
It's coming from five degrees to port, sir.

1012
01:39:16,596 --> 01:39:19,121
Okay, keep riding that beam.

1013
01:39:19,299 --> 01:39:20,391
yes sir

1014
01:39:33,092 --> 01:39:36,992


1015
01:39:42,337 --> 01:39:46,006
Major, l picked up some great music from Honolulu.

1016
01:39:46,425 --> 01:39:48,634
That's fine, pipe it through.

1017
01:39:51,722 --> 01:39:53,097
Okay.

1018
01:40:08,071 --> 01:40:10,573
Where's the damn chow truck?

1019
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:14,914
Shut the thing down, George.

1020
01:40:15,155 --> 01:40:16,850
It's already after 7.

1021
01:40:16,995 --> 01:40:19,421
Hey, Joe, come here.

1022
01:40:19,682 --> 01:40:21,149
What do you make of that?

1023
01:40:21,392 --> 01:40:23,522
I've been watching it for minutes.

1024
01:40:23,919 --> 01:40:25,254
It's moving in, fast.

1025
01:40:25,463 --> 01:40:27,831
I've never seen anything that big.

1026
01:40:27,982 --> 01:40:31,062
- Looks like two main pulses. - Hey, Joe, l got it.

1027
01:40:31,852 --> 01:40:36,096
I make that about 140 miles north, three degrees east.

1028
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:40,271
Don't make sense, we got no planes out that far.

1029
01:40:40,595 --> 01:40:42,538
We gotta contact the information center.

1030
01:40:42,789 --> 01:40:45,148
Our problem is over at 7:00.

1031
01:40:45,483 --> 01:40:47,980
The center might make some sense out of it.

1032
01:40:48,011 --> 01:40:49,951
Okay, suit yourself.

1033
01:40:59,733 --> 01:41:01,428
lnformation center.

1034
01:41:02,902 --> 01:41:06,133
Yeah? l don't know, Mac, we're all closed down here.

1035
01:41:07,130 --> 01:41:09,340
ls that right?

1036
01:41:09,575 --> 01:41:10,169
Hang on a minute.

1037
01:41:10,391 --> 01:41:11,741
Lieutenant, sir.

1038
01:41:19,219 --> 01:41:20,584
Lieutenant Tyler.

1039
01:41:20,743 --> 01:41:23,244
Sir, this is Private Elliot, Opana Point.

1040
01:41:23,438 --> 01:41:25,788
There's a large formation of planes coming in...

1041
01:41:26,026 --> 01:41:29,120
... 140 miles, three degrees east.

1042
01:41:29,277 --> 01:41:31,127
Yeah?

1043
01:41:31,464 --> 01:41:34,763
Well, don't worry about it.

1044
01:41:37,118 --> 01:41:39,729
The boys at Opana Point must have picked up the B-17s...

1045
01:41:40,372 --> 01:41:41,997
...coming in from the mainland.

1046
01:41:43,875 --> 01:41:47,679
- He said not to worry about it. - Come on, let's go eat.

1047
01:41:55,011 --> 01:41:59,815
Colonel, l sent this to Manila,the canal zone and San Francisco...

1048
01:41:59,983 --> 01:42:03,125
...but the direct channel to Hawaii is out.

1049
01:42:03,361 --> 01:42:04,661
Atmospherics again?

1050
01:42:04,865 --> 01:42:05,889
Yes, sir,

1051
01:42:06,133 --> 01:42:07,498
it's real bad today.

1052
01:42:07,834 --> 01:42:10,200
We could give it to the Navy.

1053
01:42:10,318 --> 01:42:13,100
What makes you think their atmospherics are better?

1054
01:42:15,375 --> 01:42:17,876
- Send it as a telegram. - Yes, sir.

1055
01:42:19,399 --> 01:42:21,999


1056
01:42:25,542 --> 01:42:30,045
Our ultimatum should be delivered in Washington

1057
01:42:30,222 --> 01:42:31,053
before the attack begins.

1058
01:42:33,460 --> 01:42:35,291
I hope everything is on schedule.

1059
01:42:35,302 --> 01:42:37,992
Don't worry, sir. The Emperor insists...

1060
01:42:38,198 --> 01:42:41,292
...that we follow the rules of the Geneva Convention.

1061
01:42:41,368 --> 01:42:42,438
Our declaration of war will be delivered...

1062
01:42:42,839 --> 01:42:47,371
...at 1 :00 p.m., 30 minutes before the attack begins.

1063
01:43:11,338 --> 01:43:14,256
The typing still isn't finished.

1064
01:43:15,870 --> 01:43:17,767
We'll have to postpone our 1 :00 appointment with Secretary Hull.

1065
01:43:18,672 --> 01:43:21,062
pospond the meeting time to 1:30

1066
01:43:23,977 --> 01:43:27,606
Do you mean a submarine was sighted over half an hour ago...

1067
01:43:27,770 --> 01:43:30,439
...and that it's taken this long to report it to me?

1068
01:43:31,441 --> 01:43:35,216
I don't care if it still hasn't been confirmed.

1069
01:43:35,345 --> 01:43:39,255
I should've been informed after the ward radioed a first report.

1070
01:43:39,349 --> 01:43:42,485
A submarine that close is a serious matter.

1071
01:43:42,561 --> 01:43:43,188
A very serious matter.

1072
01:43:43,353 --> 01:43:45,788
Get the confirmation,

1073
01:43:45,898 --> 01:43:46,795
all the reports to my office.

1074
01:43:46,956 --> 01:43:49,375
I mean, right now.

1075
01:43:49,402 --> 01:43:49,964
Have my driver get the car.

1076
01:43:50,003 --> 01:43:50,697
Aye, aye, sir. Oh, sir...

1077
01:43:51,004 --> 01:43:54,769
...should l tell General Short you'll miss the golf date?

1078
01:43:54,806 --> 01:43:57,466
No, damn it, get my car.

1079
01:44:03,650 --> 01:44:06,141
A message for the general at Fort Shafter.

1080
01:44:06,386 --> 01:44:07,566
- ls it marked urgent? - No.

1081
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:14,920


1082
01:44:40,554 --> 01:44:43,182
Target sighted

1083
01:44:50,629 --> 01:44:53,518


1084
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:03,098
It's a little bumpy, Davey...

1085
01:45:03,342 --> 01:45:05,401
...but you have to fly in all kinds of weather.

1086
01:45:05,644 --> 01:45:07,100
Sure, Miss Fort.

1087
01:45:25,263 --> 01:45:29,120
Don't let the nose drop.

1088
01:45:29,223 --> 01:45:31,599
That's better. You're doing just fine.

1089
01:45:51,590 --> 01:45:53,251
I'm taking over, Davey.

1090
01:46:14,780 --> 01:46:19,436
Warrant Officer Mizuki, signal all planes, "prepare to attack."

1091
01:46:19,584 --> 01:46:20,214
Yes sir

1092
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:28,714
A signal from Fuchida, "objective sighted, preparing to attack."

1093
01:47:14,455 --> 01:47:16,802
Everything is strangely quiet.

1094
01:47:18,334 --> 01:47:22,870
The American anti-aircraft batteries haven't fired a shot!

1095
01:47:26,685 --> 01:47:29,779
And no enemy fighters over the harbor, sir!

1096
01:47:35,185 --> 01:47:37,150
We've done it!

1097
01:47:39,198 --> 01:47:42,623
Send the message:

1098
01:47:42,901 --> 01:47:44,391
"Tora! Tora! Tora!"

1099
01:47:44,603 --> 01:47:45,763
Yes sir

1100
01:47:49,407 --> 01:47:51,266
"Tora! Tora! Tora!"

1101
01:48:01,753 --> 01:48:03,482
It;s "Tora! Tora! Tora!"

1102
01:48:52,271 --> 01:48:53,697
Stand by.

1103
01:49:59,972 --> 01:50:01,161
Execute.

1104
01:50:59,932 --> 01:51:01,024
Get his number.

1105
01:51:01,166 --> 01:51:02,827
I'll report him for safety violations.

1106
01:51:26,658 --> 01:51:28,490
Go... get out of here...

1107
01:51:28,661 --> 01:51:29,494
Let's go!

1108
01:51:37,295 --> 01:51:38,495
Come on!

1109
01:51:44,225 --> 01:51:46,935
Alert all commands:

1110
01:51:48,514 --> 01:51:51,244
"Air raid. Pearl Harbor.

1111
01:51:52,150 --> 01:51:55,039
This is no drill."

1112
01:52:01,793 --> 01:52:04,023
Target! Warships ahead

1113
01:52:07,833 --> 01:52:09,357
Aim...

1114
01:52:14,973 --> 01:52:16,770
Drop!

1115
01:52:24,348 --> 01:52:27,309
General Quarters. General Quarters.

1116
01:52:27,768 --> 01:52:31,271
Man your stations. Man your stations.

1117
01:52:37,695 --> 01:52:38,987
Sir.

1118
01:52:56,506 --> 01:52:58,840
Battle stations. Battle stations.

1119
01:53:07,350 --> 01:53:10,852
Fire your gun. Fire at will.

1120
01:53:11,521 --> 01:53:12,521
That bastard!

1121
01:53:30,540 --> 01:53:33,166
Station six, man your pump.

1122
01:53:44,345 --> 01:53:45,595
Plane to starboard.

1123
01:54:01,146 --> 01:54:03,034
Pearl Harbor is being attacked.

1124
01:54:03,230 --> 01:54:06,866
- Pearl Harbor? - Pearl Harbor is being bombed.Pearl Harbor's being attacked.

1125
01:54:06,985 --> 01:54:08,678
Go back to your quarters. Pearl Harbor's being attacked.

1126
01:54:52,998 --> 01:54:54,795
What in the hell is going on?

1127
01:54:56,535 --> 01:54:58,730
Why wasn't the Army notified?

1128
01:54:58,937 --> 01:55:00,893
Did anyone think to inform Washington?

1129
01:55:01,740 --> 01:55:03,139
I thought so.

1130
01:55:03,742 --> 01:55:05,698
- General. - Put all units on a full war footing.

1131
01:55:05,944 --> 01:55:07,400
Alert the territorial guard.

1132
01:55:07,746 --> 01:55:09,236
Open a command post at Aliamanu Crater.

1133
01:55:09,315 --> 01:55:11,104
- Yes, sir. - I'll be right down.

1134
01:55:16,989 --> 01:55:18,945
Oh, my God.

1135
01:55:20,191 --> 01:55:24,152
The island's under attack. Those bastards will kill us all.

1136
01:55:25,655 --> 01:55:28,156
Men, get to the armory. Get guns, ammunition.

1137
01:55:28,267 --> 01:55:30,729
- You too, lieutenant. - Yes, sir.

1138
01:55:36,842 --> 01:55:39,204
- Operator. - Duarte airfield.

1139
01:55:39,778 --> 01:55:41,177
All the phone lines are jammed.

1140
01:55:41,447 --> 01:55:43,005
Well, try the radio again.

1141
01:56:14,161 --> 01:56:16,806
Hose down that plane.

1142
01:56:30,052 --> 01:56:31,052
Run for it.

1143
01:56:31,563 --> 01:56:33,795
Run, run!

1144
01:56:40,772 --> 01:56:42,000
There's Hickam.

1145
01:56:42,207 --> 01:56:45,005
Major, l heard something funny on the Honolulu radio.

1146
01:56:49,714 --> 01:56:51,841
What kind of traffic control is this?

1147
01:56:52,050 --> 01:56:54,507
The radio said something about an attack.

1148
01:56:54,719 --> 01:56:55,743
They're Japs, sir.

1149
01:57:00,025 --> 01:57:02,255
What a way to fly into a war.

1150
01:57:02,527 --> 01:57:03,789
Unarmed and out of gas.

1151
01:57:04,162 --> 01:57:06,691
Oboe leader to Oboe flight.

1152
01:57:06,888 --> 01:57:10,591
We've flown into the middle of a war. Get out fast.

1153
01:57:10,700 --> 01:57:13,091
Anywhere. lf you can't make Hickam, try Bellows or Wheeler.

1154
01:57:24,316 --> 01:57:25,772
Sir, we've been hit. Nothing serious.

1155
01:57:26,051 --> 01:57:28,110
They shot one circuit box.

1156
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:29,446
The landing light isn't working.

1157
01:57:29,688 --> 01:57:32,614
Better use the hand crank. Hurry.

1158
01:57:56,081 --> 01:57:58,179
- Major. - Yeah.

1159
01:57:58,383 --> 01:57:59,441
One wheel is stuck.

1160
01:57:59,718 --> 01:58:00,878
Well, jolt it loose.

1161
01:58:01,086 --> 01:58:02,246
We're going in.

1162
01:58:02,454 --> 01:58:03,580
l tried.

1163
01:58:03,755 --> 01:58:04,847
Try again!

1164
01:58:08,317 --> 01:58:10,652
Here they come. Fire!

1165
01:58:17,335 --> 01:58:18,563
Tell them to stop shooting at us!

1166
01:58:18,737 --> 01:58:19,999
We're Americans.

1167
01:58:27,145 --> 01:58:28,134
Major,

1168
01:58:28,380 --> 01:58:30,507
no go, sir.

1169
01:58:31,650 --> 01:58:34,039
Like l said, it's a hell of a way to fly into a war.

1170
01:59:01,871 --> 01:59:03,329
- Run for it! - Hurry up!

1171
01:59:06,818 --> 01:59:08,911
Tower to B-17, there's a Jap on your tail.

1172
01:59:09,154 --> 01:59:10,849
Goose your engine and get out.

1173
02:00:49,788 --> 02:00:51,187
Have damage control report all damages.

1174
02:00:51,389 --> 02:00:52,651
Aye  sir

1175
02:00:52,857 --> 02:00:55,519
Sir, if we stay here we're gonna fry.

1176
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:57,489
Okay, sergeant, let's get the men down.

1177
02:00:57,762 --> 02:00:59,423
All right, you guys, let's go.

1178
02:00:59,964 --> 02:01:02,824
Where the hell are our fighters?

1179
02:01:26,291 --> 02:01:27,815
Captain,

1180
02:01:28,426 --> 02:01:30,291
the main fuel tanks are fractured.

1181
02:01:30,495 --> 02:01:32,360
Lower deck's flooded, we're listing eight degrees.

1182
02:01:32,797 --> 02:01:34,094
Counter flood, counter flood.

1183
02:01:34,299 --> 02:01:35,095
Aye Sir

1184
02:01:45,043 --> 02:01:46,874
You wanted confirmation, captain? Take a look.

1185
02:01:47,112 --> 02:01:49,871
There's your confirmation!

1186
02:01:57,589 --> 02:01:59,716
¡°Oklahoma¡±, capsized.

1187
02:02:00,892 --> 02:02:03,452
Nevada's taken a torpedo forward and is down to the head.

1188
02:02:04,095 --> 02:02:05,084
West Virginia,

1189
02:02:05,330 --> 02:02:07,924
subjected to six torpedo hits and several deck fires.

1190
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:11,094
Raleigh and Helena damaged and listing."

1191
02:02:11,336 --> 02:02:12,667
The California, two torpedoes,

1192
02:02:12,871 --> 02:02:15,669
fires all around, temporarily abandoned.

1193
02:02:16,341 --> 02:02:18,036
I've just come from her.

1194
02:02:34,525 --> 02:02:35,719
Targeting

1195
02:02:39,263 --> 02:02:40,594
Aiming...

1196
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:43,492
Aiming...

1197
02:02:46,704 --> 02:02:48,035
Locked

1198
02:02:49,340 --> 02:02:50,602
Drop

1199
02:03:11,762 --> 02:03:13,491
it's a hit

1200
02:03:30,381 --> 02:03:31,912
It's spent, sir.

1201
02:03:39,790 --> 02:03:42,020
Would've been merciful had it killed me.

1202
02:03:50,134 --> 02:03:51,533
Sir

1203
02:03:53,437 --> 02:03:55,268
A message from Flight Leader Fuchida.

1204
02:03:55,706 --> 02:04:00,029
"Have inflicted serious damage on numerous battleships."

1205
02:04:01,379 --> 02:04:02,744
Excellent

1206
02:04:02,980 --> 02:04:04,971
"Arizona"... heavily damaged

1207
02:04:09,120 --> 02:04:11,452
"Nevada"... moderate damaged

1208
02:04:17,228 --> 02:04:19,651
Better than we had dreamed!

1209
02:04:23,134 --> 02:04:24,032
That's great

1210
02:04:24,702 --> 02:04:25,862
But...

1211
02:04:26,637 --> 02:04:28,935
Where are our priority targets...

1212
02:04:30,641 --> 02:04:32,302
...the American carriers?

1213
02:04:36,881 --> 02:04:37,745
Mr. Secretary.

1214
02:04:40,518 --> 02:04:43,510
"Air raid. Pearl Harbor. This is no drill."

1215
02:04:44,522 --> 02:04:46,424
No, this can't be true.

1216
02:04:46,998 --> 02:04:48,590
They must mean the Philippines.

1217
02:04:48,759 --> 02:04:50,124
No, sir.

1218
02:04:50,328 --> 02:04:51,727
It's Pearl.

1219
02:04:54,165 --> 02:04:56,531
Get me the White House, the direct line.

1220
02:04:56,701 --> 02:04:57,599
Yes, sir.

1221
02:05:03,474 --> 02:05:05,635
Mr. Ambassador, Mr. Hull will see you in a moment.

1222
02:05:05,843 --> 02:05:07,367
Please be seated.

1223
02:05:12,417 --> 02:05:15,174
Mr. President, has this been confirmed?

1224
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:20,877
Then, sir, I'd like you to have it confirmed...

1225
02:05:20,996 --> 02:05:23,668
...before l receive Nomura and Kurusu.

1226
02:05:23,828 --> 02:05:25,693
They're waiting outside.

1227
02:05:43,080 --> 02:05:45,640
get out of here...

1228
02:06:26,857 --> 02:06:29,417
Operator. Operator.

1229
02:06:29,627 --> 02:06:31,424
Get me Haleiwa field. Fast.

1230
02:06:31,896 --> 02:06:35,286
George, get ahold of a car, a truck, anything.

1231
02:06:35,366 --> 02:06:38,290
I'm calling Haleiwa. I'll get them to start our planes.

1232
02:06:38,369 --> 02:06:39,131
Go.

1233
02:06:39,270 --> 02:06:39,964
All right

1234
02:08:39,756 --> 02:08:41,815
Battleship on the left, sir!

1235
02:08:48,565 --> 02:08:52,057
It's the Nevada. She's making a run for the sea!

1236
02:08:53,303 --> 02:08:57,901
lf we sink her in the channel, the harbor will be blocked for months!

1237
02:09:08,118 --> 02:09:10,279
Recommend course 2-3-0, sir.

1238
02:09:10,487 --> 02:09:12,648
Very well. Stay at 2-3-0.

1239
02:09:12,956 --> 02:09:14,355
Stay at 2-3-0, sir.

1240
02:09:45,122 --> 02:09:47,545
Take it down  Take it down

1241
02:10:00,862 --> 02:10:02,196
Take cover!

1242
02:10:19,023 --> 02:10:20,917
More hose! More hose!

1243
02:10:35,071 --> 02:10:36,800
More water.

1244
02:10:39,943 --> 02:10:42,468
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

1245
02:10:55,125 --> 02:11:00,389
- Abandon ship! Abandon Ship! - Over the side!

1246
02:11:03,233 --> 02:11:05,155
Can't get through the outer channel in this shape.

1247
02:11:05,402 --> 02:11:09,263
She goes down here, she'll block the south channel.

1248
02:11:09,506 --> 02:11:12,634
We'll have to beach her there so she's clear.

1249
02:11:33,163 --> 02:11:36,462
Come on... get out of here...

1250
02:11:37,467 --> 02:11:40,664
move...

1251
02:14:58,034 --> 02:14:59,493
File these.

1252
02:15:12,848 --> 02:15:13,940
G-5.

1253
02:15:20,922 --> 02:15:22,184
I need five copies each.

1254
02:15:25,186 --> 02:15:26,770
Messenger.

1255
02:15:28,830 --> 02:15:30,892
- Take this to General Short's office. - Right.

1256
02:15:32,868 --> 02:15:34,062
File these.

1257
02:15:47,949 --> 02:15:48,745
Corporal.

1258
02:15:49,885 --> 02:15:51,375
This has to be decoded for the general.

1259
02:15:51,620 --> 02:15:53,508
Take it to the decoding room.

1260
02:15:53,722 --> 02:15:54,848
Ask them to send it back as soon as they can.

1261
02:15:55,056 --> 02:15:55,954
Yes, sir.

1262
02:16:03,698 --> 02:16:05,689
Come on...

1263
02:16:17,145 --> 02:16:18,271
Run for it!

1264
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:28,013
Drop the hose and get the ladders and axes.

1265
02:16:29,724 --> 02:16:30,884
What are you waiting for?

1266
02:16:31,092 --> 02:16:33,518
- We got no water. - Why? What's wrong?

1267
02:16:33,628 --> 02:16:35,988
It's the Arizona. She cut the pipes in the mains.

1268
02:16:36,164 --> 02:16:39,692
The tanker in the ocean there is full of aviation fuel.

1269
02:16:39,767 --> 02:16:41,433
lf it goes, we'll blow up half the harbor.

1270
02:16:41,870 --> 02:16:42,928
Hurry up..

1271
02:16:43,138 --> 02:16:44,196
Come on...

1272
02:16:44,439 --> 02:16:45,565
Get out of here...

1273
02:17:46,234 --> 02:17:47,132
Hey, look out!

1274
02:17:48,136 --> 02:17:50,525
Get out of here

1275
02:18:07,655 --> 02:18:12,080
ln all my 50 years of public service...

1276
02:18:14,162 --> 02:18:16,120
...l have never seen a document so crowded with infamous falsehoods...

1277
02:18:18,443 --> 02:18:20,193
...and distortions...

1278
02:18:20,862 --> 02:18:23,196
...on a scale so huge...

1279
02:18:23,364 --> 02:18:26,366
...that l never imagined until today...

1280
02:18:27,243 --> 02:18:29,870
...that any government on this planet...

1281
02:18:30,079 --> 02:18:32,873
...was capable of uttering them.

1282
02:18:46,494 --> 02:18:48,052
Mr. Hull.

1283
02:18:49,897 --> 02:18:51,330
Go.

1284
02:19:56,464 --> 02:19:58,659
What's the matter? Why in hell doesn't the next wave take off?

1285
02:19:58,866 --> 02:20:01,255
Why they have not taken off for the second wave attack?

1286
02:20:01,269 --> 02:20:01,928
It will be too late

1287
02:20:02,870 --> 02:20:05,634
But, sir, no one has given the order.

1288
02:20:18,786 --> 02:20:19,775
Sir

1289
02:20:22,090 --> 02:20:24,615
We've knocked out the American airfields...

1290
02:20:24,792 --> 02:20:26,657
...sunk four battleships,

1291
02:20:26,828 --> 02:20:28,420
heavily damaged three more.

1292
02:20:34,335 --> 02:20:35,734
Sir,

1293
02:20:35,970 --> 02:20:38,165
Rear Admiral Yamaguchi's carrier has signaled!

1294
02:20:38,406 --> 02:20:41,671
"Attack group ready for takeoff."

1295
02:20:51,819 --> 02:20:55,744
Unfortunately, the American carriers were not at Pearl Harbor.

1296
02:20:57,592 --> 02:21:00,322
Since we don't know where they are...

1297
02:21:00,495 --> 02:21:01,484
...we can't use our ...

1298
02:21:01,562 --> 02:21:03,826
limited supply of fuel to look for them.

1299
02:21:05,600 --> 02:21:10,196
We must not forget that enemy submarines will be searching for us.

1300
02:21:12,340 --> 02:21:14,433
We have been lucky so far.

1301
02:21:17,078 --> 02:21:18,443
No take-off signal yet?

1302
02:21:18,646 --> 02:21:20,011
There is a signal now!

1303
02:21:20,081 --> 02:21:20,809
Good

1304
02:21:20,882 --> 02:21:21,746
Prepare to take off

1305
02:21:21,983 --> 02:21:22,915
Yes sir

1306
02:21:23,017 --> 02:21:23,915
Wait

1307
02:21:23,985 --> 02:21:24,713
What?

1308
02:21:27,088 --> 02:21:30,046
It says, "All ships head for Japan as soon as our planes return."

1309
02:21:39,834 --> 02:21:40,892
It can't be!

1310
02:21:43,904 --> 02:21:45,599
It must be a mistake!

1311
02:21:46,107 --> 02:21:47,131
Sir

1312
02:21:51,545 --> 02:21:55,208
We cannot turn back now.

1313
02:21:55,416 --> 02:21:59,577
We must destroy the American carriers and their dry docks...

1314
02:21:59,653 --> 02:22:00,845
...no matter how long it takes!

1315
02:22:01,288 --> 02:22:02,915
You're wrong.

1316
02:22:03,424 --> 02:22:08,157
Our mission has been completely accomplished.

1317
02:22:08,329 --> 02:22:10,320
This task force is vital to us.

1318
02:22:10,397 --> 02:22:14,185
It is my duty to return it intact.

1319
02:22:20,841 --> 02:22:24,231
This war is just beginning.

1320
02:22:27,414 --> 02:22:30,042
We have a long way to go.

1321
02:22:31,652 --> 02:22:33,244
On starboard

1322
02:22:33,454 --> 02:22:34,978
On starboard

1323
02:22:36,123 --> 02:22:38,421
On starboard

1324
02:22:44,698 --> 02:22:46,757
Turn around

1325
02:22:47,201 --> 02:22:48,691
Turn around

1326
02:22:52,640 --> 02:22:53,595
Yes, all right.

1327
02:22:54,642 --> 02:22:58,134
This came from the decoding room, a cablegram from the War Department.

1328
02:23:11,859 --> 02:23:13,554
Get a copy to Admiral Kimmel.

1329
02:23:31,645 --> 02:23:32,441
Pardon me, admiral.

1330
02:23:32,646 --> 02:23:35,115
- From Washington. - Thank you.

1331
02:23:43,324 --> 02:23:44,256
Gentlemen.

1332
02:23:51,665 --> 02:23:55,489
"The Japanese are presenting at 1 p.m...

1333
02:23:55,529 --> 02:23:57,489
...Eastern Standard Time today...

1334
02:23:58,199 --> 02:24:00,533
...what amounts to an ultimatum.

1335
02:24:02,870 --> 02:24:07,874
Just what significance the hour set may have, we do not know...

1336
02:24:09,919 --> 02:24:12,879
...but be on alert accordingly."

1337
02:24:14,382 --> 02:24:15,882
Signed...

1338
02:24:16,509 --> 02:24:20,845
...George C. Marshall, chief of staff.

1339
02:24:29,939 --> 02:24:31,856
My God.

1340
02:24:47,331 --> 02:24:51,251
This leaves the Navy with only two combat groups in the Central Pacific.

1341
02:24:51,725 --> 02:24:53,716
Ours and the Lexington.

1342
02:24:54,295 --> 02:24:55,990
We don't want to get caught like they did.

1343
02:24:56,230 --> 02:24:57,925
I don't intend to.

1344
02:24:58,399 --> 02:24:59,855
When can you be ready for sea again?

1345
02:25:00,067 --> 02:25:01,557
We can fuel and provision and

1346
02:25:01,735 --> 02:25:03,100
be under way before dawn.

1347
02:25:03,437 --> 02:25:05,701
Good. That's good.

1348
02:25:16,884 --> 02:25:20,706
Here is an announcement from the Navy Department, released December 7th.

1349
02:25:21,789 --> 02:25:26,146
"Before daybreak today, the Imperial Navy successfully launched...

1350
02:25:26,727 --> 02:25:31,220
...a large-scale air raid against the American Pacific Fleet in Hawaii."

1351
02:25:31,765 --> 02:25:33,756
We salute the Commander-in-Chief of our Fleet...

1352
02:25:33,834 --> 02:25:37,380
...Admiral Yamamoto.

1353
02:25:51,655 --> 02:25:57,553
I had intended to deal a fatal blow to the American fleet...

1354
02:25:57,758 --> 02:26:01,154
...by attacking Pearl Harbor...

1355
02:26:01,294 --> 02:26:05,325
...immediately after Japan's official declaration of war.

1356
02:26:07,468 --> 02:26:15,364
But according to the American radio, Pearl Harbor was attacked...

1357
02:26:16,143 --> 02:26:19,340
...55 minutes before our ultimatum...

1358
02:26:19,546 --> 02:26:22,801
...was delivered in Washington.

1359
02:26:26,453 --> 02:26:29,117
I can't imagine anything...

1360
02:26:29,934 --> 02:26:33,724
...that would infuriate the Americans more.

1361
02:26:35,664 --> 02:26:38,319
I fear all we have done...

1362
02:26:38,399 --> 02:26:40,890
...is to awaken a sleeping giant

1363
02:26:41,101 --> 02:26:45,265
...and fill him with a terrible resolve.

1364
02:26:46,101 --> 02:26:50,265


1365
02:26:50,801 --> 02:26:56,865


1366
02:26:57,003 --> 02:27:01,865


1367
02:27:02,313 --> 02:27:07,565


1368
02:27:07,803 --> 02:27:14,365


1369
02:27:14,793 --> 02:27:22,365


1370
02:27:22,793 --> 02:27:30,265


1371
02:27:30,503 --> 02:27:37,265
