1
00:09:28,093 --> 00:09:31,608
The Japanese ambassador just arrived.
He should be up shortly.

2
00:09:32,253 --> 00:09:33,242
Thank you.

3
00:09:36,093 --> 00:09:38,288
The Japanese are stalling, Henry.

4
00:09:38,773 --> 00:09:40,206
You know that.

5
00:09:41,813 --> 00:09:44,452
When Nomura took over as ambassador...

6
00:09:44,653 --> 00:09:47,645
...I had some hopes of settling
our differences.

7
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:50,686
But our meetings so far
have been unproductive.

8
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:55,163
He brings me proposals,
I offer compromises.

9
00:09:55,373 --> 00:09:58,809
He brings me counterproposals,
and so on.

10
00:10:00,093 --> 00:10:04,609
I tell you, Henry,
Nomura was sent here to buy time.

11
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,088
That's what he's doing,
at our expense.

12
00:10:07,293 --> 00:10:09,124
The president thinks he's...

13
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:13,048
...a man we can trust and deal with.

14
00:10:16,173 --> 00:10:18,846
Mr. Ambassador, we meet again.

15
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:21,408
It is always a pleasure.

16
00:10:21,613 --> 00:10:25,208
I assume you know Mr. Stimson,
the head of our War Department.

17
00:10:25,453 --> 00:10:27,489
Oh, yes, of course.

18
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,570
Mr. Ambassador.

19
00:10:29,773 --> 00:10:31,889
I do hope, Mr. Stimson...

20
00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:35,403
...your presence here
doesn't indicate anything ominous.

21
00:10:35,613 --> 00:10:36,966
Of course not, Mr. Nomura.

22
00:10:37,173 --> 00:10:40,006
Mr. Nomura, won't you please sit down?

23
00:10:40,213 --> 00:10:41,692
Thank you.

24
00:10:46,093 --> 00:10:49,563
Well, since our last talk
a week ago...

25
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:51,968
...I have received a certain...

26
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:54,368
...shall we say...

27
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:57,173
...question from my government...

28
00:10:57,373 --> 00:11:01,446
...to put to you
to clarify certain matters.

29
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,532
There it is.

30
00:11:32,453 --> 00:11:35,968
This machine lets us intercept
every word between Tokyo...

31
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:37,765
...and all Japanese embassies.

32
00:11:38,973 --> 00:11:42,124
The coded material is fed
into that machine.

33
00:11:43,893 --> 00:11:46,851
It goes round and round in there...

34
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:51,290
...and comes out here,
decoded in Japanese.

35
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:54,047
All we have to do is translate it.

36
00:11:57,293 --> 00:11:59,853
We decode this quicker than
the Japanese embassy...

37
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,725
...right here in Washington.

38
00:12:04,373 --> 00:12:07,365
No wonder you decided to call it
"Operation Magic."

39
00:12:09,373 --> 00:12:12,092
- The latest intercept, sir.
- Thank you.

40
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:19,806
Things are getting a little
hotter in the Pacific.

41
00:12:28,653 --> 00:12:31,451
As long as we're sharing
this assignment...

42
00:12:32,173 --> 00:12:34,050
...take a look at this.

43
00:12:39,013 --> 00:12:40,128
Behold the 1 <i>2 apostles.

44
00:12:41,613 --> 00:12:44,969
The chosen few are authorized
to see the magic intercepts.

45
00:12:45,813 --> 00:12:49,169
Hap Arnold, Chief of the Air Corps,
isn't on the list.

46
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:54,010
No, and not one of our
overseas commanders.

47
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:42,292
Stand by.

48
00:14:45,293 --> 00:14:46,328
Execute.

49
00:15:04,013 --> 00:15:06,322
Look at that entrance to the harbor.

50
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:11,049
Sink one good-sized ship in the channel
and you've bottled up our whole fleet.

51
00:15:12,373 --> 00:15:16,730
You know as well as I do,
this harbor is a mousetrap.

52
00:15:18,053 --> 00:15:21,682
Fleet should have stayed
in San Diego where it belongs.

53
00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:25,206
I made the mistake to point
that out to Roosevelt.

54
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:27,012
We're expected to obey orders.

55
00:15:29,093 --> 00:15:33,132
We're also expected to exercise
our own good judgment.

56
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,607
I didn't ask for the job.

57
00:15:36,093 --> 00:15:40,052
Sorry, Kim, but this was my command,
and it's become habit...

58
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:42,608
...to worry about the security
of the fleet.

59
00:15:44,253 --> 00:15:46,687
The British, flying some
old biplanes...

60
00:15:46,893 --> 00:15:50,966
...torpedoed and sank three Italian
battleships at Taranto.

61
00:15:51,173 --> 00:15:53,892
Harbor very much like this one.

62
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:58,767
I share your concern, but CNO
doesn't think it can happen here.

63
00:15:58,973 --> 00:15:59,928
Why not?

64
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:02,328
A torpedo dropped
from a plane plunges...

65
00:16:02,573 --> 00:16:06,088
...to a depth of 75 feet or more
before it levels off.

66
00:16:06,293 --> 00:16:09,251
I know, and Pearl is only
40 feet deep.

67
00:16:10,813 --> 00:16:12,565
I'm still worried, Kim.

68
00:19:01,293 --> 00:19:02,612
Ten-hut!

69
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,364
Do the planes have to be
parked like that?

70
00:19:16,173 --> 00:19:17,572
Way at the edge of the field.

71
00:19:17,773 --> 00:19:19,729
Standard dispersal procedure, general.

72
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:21,207
In case of enemy air attack.

73
00:19:22,853 --> 00:19:25,811
There are 130,000 Japanese
on this island.

74
00:19:26,013 --> 00:19:28,004
Our main problem is sabotage.

75
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:32,246
It'd be too easy for enemies
to sneak in at night...

76
00:19:32,493 --> 00:19:36,008
...and blow up every one of them
if they're left out there.

77
00:19:36,613 --> 00:19:39,127
Make a note, Fielder,
we'll have to make changes.

78
00:19:39,933 --> 00:19:41,366
Ten-hut.

79
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:49,125
<i>Admiral Halsey's here to see you.</i>

80
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,925
Send him in, please.

81
00:19:53,653 --> 00:19:58,443
Blast me, break me, court marshal me,
draw and quarter me...

82
00:19:58,653 --> 00:20:00,803
...if you think they're gonna
send my ships...

83
00:20:01,013 --> 00:20:03,129
...on convoy duty in the Atlantic.

84
00:20:04,093 --> 00:20:06,368
Kim, I think they've
gone nuts in Washington.

85
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:09,002
How will I fight
a task force if they send...

86
00:20:09,213 --> 00:20:10,931
...my ships to the Atlantic?

87
00:20:11,133 --> 00:20:14,648
That damn ocean is a swimming hole
compared to the Pacific.

88
00:20:14,853 --> 00:20:18,163
What are we, a fighting fleet
or these toy boats here...

89
00:20:18,373 --> 00:20:20,523
...so the Japs
can buy them at Christmas?

90
00:20:21,213 --> 00:20:25,092
All right, Bill, now ease it off.
It's not just you.

91
00:20:26,053 --> 00:20:28,362
They asked for some
of our tankers too.

92
00:20:28,813 --> 00:20:30,883
How do they expect to feed
these wagons...

93
00:20:31,093 --> 00:20:33,971
...parked out here on
this land-locked duck pond?

94
00:20:34,173 --> 00:20:37,006
You're still planning on rotating
half of them at sea?

95
00:20:37,213 --> 00:20:38,123
I was.

96
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:42,645
Look, Kim, you've got to make them
understand what's going on out here.

97
00:20:46,013 --> 00:20:48,447
I'm gonna do everything I can, Bill.

98
00:20:49,213 --> 00:20:50,805
Even go to the president.

99
00:20:53,813 --> 00:20:56,646
By God, I knew there was
at least one man...

100
00:20:56,853 --> 00:20:59,651
...in this man's Navy
who hadn't gone nuts.

101
00:23:16,893 --> 00:23:20,203
And we go on to say,
"It should be noted that Japan...

102
00:23:20,453 --> 00:23:24,571
...has never preceded hostile action
by a declaration of war.

103
00:23:24,773 --> 00:23:27,446
We believe it possible
that a fast-rated...

104
00:23:27,653 --> 00:23:31,532
...Japanese carrier force may arrive
in Hawaii with no prior warning...

105
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:33,644
...from our intelligence service.

106
00:23:33,853 --> 00:23:36,970
The most favorable time
to the enemy would be dawn.

107
00:23:37,173 --> 00:23:40,245
He probably would employ
a maximum of six carriers...

108
00:23:40,493 --> 00:23:42,131
...strike on a weekend.

109
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,767
- We recommend that the Air Corps..."
- I read it.

110
00:23:45,893 --> 00:23:46,928
Yes, sir.

111
00:23:48,213 --> 00:23:52,445
I appreciate the work that you
and General Martin have put in.

112
00:23:53,613 --> 00:23:56,969
These reports are very useful
to General Short and myself.

113
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:01,643
General Martin, you don't pull
any punches do you?

114
00:24:04,773 --> 00:24:08,652
"We recommend that the Air Corps...

115
00:24:08,853 --> 00:24:11,287
...maintain a thorough
360-degree search...

116
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:14,047
...of the Hawaiian area
during daylight.

117
00:24:14,973 --> 00:24:19,046
This will require a force of
180 B-17 airplanes."

118
00:24:19,253 --> 00:24:21,562
We can't search the sea approaches...

119
00:24:21,773 --> 00:24:23,206
...unless we have the planes, sir.

120
00:24:23,973 --> 00:24:27,283
One hundred and eighty B-17s?

121
00:24:28,693 --> 00:24:32,572
For God's sakes, that's more than
the number existing in the States.

122
00:24:32,773 --> 00:24:36,812
It looks fine on paper, but that's
not a paper fleet out there.

123
00:24:38,573 --> 00:24:40,052
Squadron from the <i>Enterprise.</i>

124
00:24:40,253 --> 00:24:43,529
Bill Halsey's working
the tails off his men.

125
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,649
Wish we had more like him.

126
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:51,089
Makes the most of what he's got.

127
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:53,851
Doesn't keep asking for the moon.

128
00:25:09,213 --> 00:25:13,923
Well, not one bomb anywhere in
the target for the past hour.

129
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:18,523
Your pilots can see it, I suppose.

130
00:25:19,173 --> 00:25:22,245
- Who's next?
- It's Anderson, sir.

131
00:25:28,813 --> 00:25:30,929
Now, that's more like it.

132
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:35,012
- Maybe your boys finally get it.
- I hope so, sir.

133
00:25:36,133 --> 00:25:37,532
Who's next?

134
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:40,005
Lieutenant Dickenson.

135
00:25:46,093 --> 00:25:48,049
Tell Lieutenant Dickenson for me...

136
00:25:48,253 --> 00:25:51,131
...he couldn't hit a bull
in the butt with a bass fiddle.

137
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:52,288
Yes, sir.

138
00:25:57,093 --> 00:25:58,845
Ten-hut.

139
00:26:08,373 --> 00:26:10,523
- Carry on.
- Carry on.

140
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,563
This it?

141
00:26:12,773 --> 00:26:14,331
Yes, sir. Our new radar.

142
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,882
It's a remarkable
scientific achievement...

143
00:26:17,093 --> 00:26:20,210
...capable of spotting an intruder
on the sea or in the air...

144
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,522
...and at quite a range.

145
00:26:21,733 --> 00:26:25,772
Now, listen colonel, as you know,
we're short on patrol planes.

146
00:26:25,973 --> 00:26:28,533
We're gonna have to rely on this...

147
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:31,327
...thing to detect the enemy.

148
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:34,167
General, radar should do the job.

149
00:26:34,373 --> 00:26:36,011
What's it doing here, not set up?

150
00:26:36,213 --> 00:26:38,443
We're about to truck it up
that mountain.

151
00:26:38,653 --> 00:26:43,283
That peak up there is the ideal spot
to put our main radar post.

152
00:26:43,493 --> 00:26:46,166
At that height, we'd be clear
of all interference.

153
00:26:46,893 --> 00:26:48,042
Obviously.

154
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:51,802
But, sir, we can't get permission
to put her up there.

155
00:26:52,573 --> 00:26:53,483
Permission?

156
00:26:53,893 --> 00:26:56,088
From the National Park Service
Department of Interior.

157
00:26:56,293 --> 00:27:00,605
See, all of this belongs
to the Hawaiian National Park.

158
00:27:00,813 --> 00:27:02,690
The Hawaiian National Park?

159
00:27:03,973 --> 00:27:07,568
Yes, sir. The Wildlife Preservation
Society is raising hell too.

160
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:10,766
And we can't get permission?

161
00:27:10,973 --> 00:27:13,282
No, sir.
Not unless we want to fight them.

162
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:16,252
Fight them? You're damn right
we're gonna fight them.

163
00:27:16,453 --> 00:27:18,683
- Now you make a note of that, Fielder.
- Yes, sir.

164
00:27:18,893 --> 00:27:22,249
Wildlife Preservation Society.

165
00:28:38,973 --> 00:28:41,441
It's no use, Hal.
I spoke to General Miles.

166
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,564
He took it up with General Marshall.

167
00:28:43,773 --> 00:28:47,561
The order stands.
The president is off the ultra list.

168
00:28:48,613 --> 00:28:50,331
Incredible.

169
00:28:50,573 --> 00:28:52,609
Withholding information
from the president.

170
00:28:52,813 --> 00:28:57,489
Security found a copy of an intercept
in a waste basket at the White House.

171
00:28:58,013 --> 00:29:02,052
Truth is, the brass don't trust some
men close to the president.

172
00:29:02,253 --> 00:29:04,642
Does anyone trust anyone anymore?

173
00:29:04,853 --> 00:29:07,925
- Do you even trust your own wife?
- Do you?

174
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:12,493
Come to think of it, I believe I do.

175
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:15,884
Part two of No. 1390, colonel.

176
00:29:16,093 --> 00:29:18,163
Tokyo to embassies
in Washington and Berlin.

177
00:29:18,373 --> 00:29:19,965
Thank you, Miss Cave.

178
00:29:24,493 --> 00:29:27,803
The Japanese are moving south
to occupy French Indo-China.

179
00:29:30,973 --> 00:29:33,282
- This is big trouble.
- Yeah.

180
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:36,004
Well, ultra list or not...

181
00:29:36,213 --> 00:29:39,091
...someone has to tell
the president about this one.

182
00:29:43,653 --> 00:29:46,247
"Therefore, we will impose
a full embargo...

183
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,688
...on all trade with Japan.

184
00:29:50,693 --> 00:29:53,844
We do not anticipate immediate
hostile action by Japan...

185
00:29:54,053 --> 00:29:55,532
...but you get this information...

186
00:29:55,733 --> 00:30:00,090
...so you may take appropriate
precautionary measures."

187
00:30:02,573 --> 00:30:05,292
"Appropriate precautionary measures."

188
00:30:05,573 --> 00:30:07,643
What the hell does that mean?

189
00:30:12,293 --> 00:30:17,048
Now, this is signed jointly
by General Marshall and Admiral Stark.

190
00:30:17,893 --> 00:30:21,852
Until we know how the Japanese will
react, we're not gonna take chances.

191
00:30:23,293 --> 00:30:25,932
- We go on full alert.
- Yes, sir.

192
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:30,448
Stark says they don't anticipate
hostile action.

193
00:30:31,893 --> 00:30:33,770
Why send a warning at all?

194
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:36,612
Damn it.

195
00:30:37,773 --> 00:30:42,164
Damn it, why can't Washington
give us the full inside story?

196
00:30:42,893 --> 00:30:44,884
I'd sooner form my own opinion.

197
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:52,324
"Don't anticipate hostile action."

198
00:30:54,973 --> 00:30:57,931
Well, all right, we'll go ahead.

199
00:30:58,533 --> 00:31:01,445
Increase air and sub patrols,
alert senior commanders.

200
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:05,202
Maybe out of this we can find out
how well we can function.

201
00:31:08,093 --> 00:31:09,048
Kaminsky.

202
00:31:09,253 --> 00:31:12,325
<i>This is Captain Earle.</i>
<i>Going on full alert.</i>

203
00:31:12,573 --> 00:31:13,972
Yes, captain.

204
00:31:14,453 --> 00:31:15,647
We're going on full alert.

205
00:31:15,853 --> 00:31:18,765
Notify all ship, sub and air patrols.

206
00:32:09,693 --> 00:32:11,729
What the hell is going on here?

207
00:32:11,933 --> 00:32:13,161
What are you doing?

208
00:32:13,373 --> 00:32:16,524
Carrying out orders.
General Short's concern is sabotage.

209
00:32:16,733 --> 00:32:19,247
All aircraft not ready
for flight from now on...

210
00:32:19,493 --> 00:32:21,484
...will be parked in the center...

211
00:32:21,693 --> 00:32:23,285
...so they can be kept under guard.

212
00:32:23,533 --> 00:32:24,932
Suppose there's an air raid.

213
00:32:25,133 --> 00:32:27,852
They hit one plane, and it all
goes up in flames.

214
00:32:28,053 --> 00:32:29,964
I'm sorry. General's orders.

215
00:39:19,773 --> 00:39:23,448
It's not an ideal radar sight,
but at least we got a permit.

216
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:25,484
Let's get the other units working.

217
00:39:25,693 --> 00:39:26,887
Easier said than done.

218
00:39:27,093 --> 00:39:28,082
What do you mean?

219
00:39:28,293 --> 00:39:32,525
We have to get all six units adjusted
and link them by phone to headquarters.

220
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:35,651
That means training men to operate
an information center...

221
00:39:35,853 --> 00:39:38,128
...so they know what to do
with the information.

222
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:39,607
Take it easy, Murph.

223
00:39:39,813 --> 00:39:44,568
- You'll figure it out.
- Yeah, I'll figure it out.

224
00:39:47,693 --> 00:39:49,012
Don't just stand there.

225
00:39:49,213 --> 00:39:51,010
You know how to operate this thing.

226
00:39:51,213 --> 00:39:52,168
We know the theory.

227
00:39:52,373 --> 00:39:54,250
Let's put that theory into practice.

228
00:39:54,493 --> 00:39:57,053
- Switch on.
- Yes, sir.

229
00:39:59,653 --> 00:40:01,962
Stay put and keep watching the screen.

230
00:40:02,173 --> 00:40:05,722
In two hours, close down.
I'll send a truck to pick you up.

231
00:40:05,973 --> 00:40:08,692
Excuse me, sir,
but what are we watching for?

232
00:40:08,893 --> 00:40:09,962
Anything unusual.

233
00:40:10,173 --> 00:40:12,289
Any large blip coming from the sea.

234
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,166
Colonel, if we do spot something,
what do we do?

235
00:40:15,373 --> 00:40:17,841
Report it to headquarters, damn it.

236
00:40:18,053 --> 00:40:19,327
- How, sir?
- What?

237
00:40:19,573 --> 00:40:21,325
We haven't got a telephone, sir.

238
00:40:21,573 --> 00:40:24,610
There's a gas station
a mile down the road.

239
00:40:24,813 --> 00:40:26,212
They must have a phone.

240
00:40:36,813 --> 00:40:40,772
We got 183 combat planes
on this base, general.

241
00:40:40,973 --> 00:40:44,852
The way they're parked now, a one-eyed
monkey hanging from a balloon...

242
00:40:45,053 --> 00:40:47,613
...could scatter them to hell
with one hand grenade.

243
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:50,646
Don't blame me.
General Short gave the order.

244
00:40:50,853 --> 00:40:52,081
Come in.

245
00:40:53,093 --> 00:40:57,006
- Sir, Lieutenants Taylor and Welch.
- Okay, send them in.

246
00:41:03,533 --> 00:41:06,286
You two men get in your planes
and fly over to Haleiwa.

247
00:41:07,573 --> 00:41:09,131
Yes, sir.

248
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:11,244
What are our orders when we get there?

249
00:41:11,973 --> 00:41:13,201
Just sit tight.

250
00:41:13,413 --> 00:41:15,722
Listen for the phone. That's all.

251
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:17,161
Yes, sir.

252
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:27,893
Haleiwa is one
of the subsidiary fields.

253
00:41:28,093 --> 00:41:31,563
We send those two up there,
two more here.

254
00:41:32,653 --> 00:41:35,565
Only way I know to disperse
a few of the planes.

255
00:41:38,613 --> 00:41:42,003
If I'd get away with it, I'd send
all to the neighbor islands.

256
00:41:42,853 --> 00:41:46,129
- You know why we're being transferred.
- Them poker games.

257
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:47,925
Been winning too often.

258
00:41:49,533 --> 00:41:53,082
Some sucker loses his shirt,
so he bitches to the general.

259
00:44:19,853 --> 00:44:23,084
Nomura has offered
his resignation several times.

260
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:25,488
But Tokyo won't let him quit.

261
00:44:26,853 --> 00:44:31,608
Instead they're sending a second
ambassador, Kurusu, to help him out.

262
00:44:33,693 --> 00:44:37,049
Do you really think
this Kurusu can do any good?

263
00:44:37,413 --> 00:44:39,881
Well, I doubt it, Frank.

264
00:44:40,093 --> 00:44:42,323
He's hardly the most tactful choice.

265
00:44:42,573 --> 00:44:44,609
When he was ambassador in Berlin...

266
00:44:44,813 --> 00:44:47,532
...he signed the Axis Pact
on behalf of Japan.

267
00:46:58,253 --> 00:47:01,006
- You sick or something?
- No.

268
00:47:01,933 --> 00:47:05,209
I've been piecing together this
batch of new intercepts.

269
00:47:05,413 --> 00:47:08,166
A frightening picture is taking shape.

270
00:47:09,253 --> 00:47:12,563
Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu
asked their government...

271
00:47:12,773 --> 00:47:17,528
...to extend a deadline for suspending
negotiation between Japan and America.

272
00:47:17,773 --> 00:47:19,491
- You remember that?
- Yeah.

273
00:47:19,693 --> 00:47:23,527
Now, according to this latest
intercept...

274
00:47:23,813 --> 00:47:27,123
...Tokyo wants to conclude
negotiations with us...

275
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:30,166
...no later than November 29...

276
00:47:30,373 --> 00:47:32,807
...after which, and I quote...

277
00:47:33,013 --> 00:47:35,652
..."Things are automatically
going to happen."

278
00:47:37,373 --> 00:47:40,126
Look at this intelligence report
from the British.

279
00:47:41,173 --> 00:47:44,085
Five Japanese troop transports
with naval escort...

280
00:47:44,293 --> 00:47:47,524
...were sighted off Formosa,
heading south.

281
00:47:47,853 --> 00:47:51,812
We've been monitoring their fleet.
Most of it seems to be on home waters.

282
00:47:52,013 --> 00:47:54,049
I'm not so sure.

283
00:48:00,933 --> 00:48:03,288
I'm betting they're
going to attack us.

284
00:48:06,613 --> 00:48:09,252
Japan is going to attack us.

285
00:48:10,893 --> 00:48:13,566
The 29th is only four days off.

286
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:17,128
The 30th is on a Sunday.

287
00:48:19,293 --> 00:48:22,649
We're gonna be attacked on Sunday,
the 30th of November.

288
00:48:27,933 --> 00:48:30,049
The pieces fit together.

289
00:48:33,773 --> 00:48:35,092
But can you prove it?

290
00:48:35,293 --> 00:48:39,081
No. But I'm convinced I'm right.

291
00:48:40,213 --> 00:48:42,044
Miss Cave? Get me General Marshall.

292
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:45,086
General Marshall's
at Fort Benning, sir.

293
00:48:45,573 --> 00:48:47,689
Then get me the secretary of war.

294
00:48:51,173 --> 00:48:52,970
I've got the evidence, Al.

295
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:58,329
And I'm gonna make the brass
around here admit I'm right.

296
00:49:07,533 --> 00:49:10,650
Bratton's analysis makes sense.

297
00:49:11,293 --> 00:49:14,330
His facts are undeniable.

298
00:49:16,093 --> 00:49:21,121
Henry, I'm washing my hands
of the whole matter.

299
00:49:21,653 --> 00:49:23,769
From now on, it's in your hands...

300
00:49:23,973 --> 00:49:26,567
...and in those
of the Navy department.

301
00:49:45,613 --> 00:49:46,728
I'll call the president.

302
00:49:47,973 --> 00:49:52,046
A message declaring a full alert
will be sent out.

303
00:49:53,173 --> 00:49:56,722
General Marshall anticipated
an emergency like this.

304
00:49:56,933 --> 00:49:59,083
Before he left to attend maneuvers...

305
00:49:59,293 --> 00:50:01,204
...he made out this alert order.

306
00:51:12,213 --> 00:51:13,931
Read this back to me.

307
00:51:18,613 --> 00:51:21,286
"Japanese future action unpredictable.

308
00:51:21,533 --> 00:51:24,809
But hostile action possible
at any moment.

309
00:51:25,293 --> 00:51:27,329
If hostilities cannot be avoided...

310
00:51:27,573 --> 00:51:32,328
...the United States desires that
Japan commit the first overt act."

311
00:51:32,533 --> 00:51:34,046
Read that again.

312
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:41,283
"If hostilities cannot be avoided,
the United States desires...

313
00:51:41,493 --> 00:51:45,168
...that Japan commit
the first overt act.

314
00:51:46,733 --> 00:51:49,725
This shouldn't be construed
as restricting you...

315
00:51:49,933 --> 00:51:53,562
...to a course of action
jeopardizing your defense.

316
00:51:53,773 --> 00:51:56,606
Prior to hostile Japanese action...

317
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:59,611
...you are directed to undertake
reconnaissance...

318
00:51:59,813 --> 00:52:02,771
...and other measures
as you deem necessary.

319
00:52:02,973 --> 00:52:05,009
These measures should be
carried out...

320
00:52:05,213 --> 00:52:07,488
...so as not to alarm
the civil population...

321
00:52:07,693 --> 00:52:11,971
...or disclose intent. By order
of General George C. Marshall."

322
00:52:12,413 --> 00:52:15,325
Not to alarm the civil population.

323
00:52:16,693 --> 00:52:17,967
What do you make of it?

324
00:52:21,173 --> 00:52:24,961
If you ask me, sir, it's double talk.

325
00:52:26,773 --> 00:52:29,890
But the chief of staff doesn't go in
for double talk.

326
00:52:31,613 --> 00:52:33,251
- We're going on alert.
- Again?

327
00:52:33,493 --> 00:52:36,212
But the men are confused.
So many alerts.

328
00:52:36,413 --> 00:52:39,211
- Damn it, unconfuse them.
- Yes, sir.

329
00:52:41,333 --> 00:52:43,767
"Japanese forces may attack
the Philippines...

330
00:52:43,973 --> 00:52:47,170
...Thailand, the Kra Peninsula
and Borneo.

331
00:52:48,013 --> 00:52:51,483
This dispatch is to be considered
a war warning."

332
00:52:55,013 --> 00:52:56,810
Well, there it is, gentlemen.

333
00:52:58,253 --> 00:53:01,245
You now have
as much information as I do.

334
00:53:01,733 --> 00:53:03,803
That's the second warning
in three days.

335
00:53:04,013 --> 00:53:06,652
"Japanese forces may attack
the Philippines...

336
00:53:06,853 --> 00:53:08,844
...Thailand, the Kra Peninsula
and Borneo."

337
00:53:09,053 --> 00:53:10,122
They don't mention us.

338
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:14,042
That's correct. I think it should be
considered significant.

339
00:53:15,293 --> 00:53:16,567
Well, gentlemen...

340
00:53:17,773 --> 00:53:20,082
...we have a job to do.

341
00:53:20,293 --> 00:53:23,763
Washington wants us to send
a squadron of fighters to Midway.

342
00:53:24,293 --> 00:53:27,251
And another squadron to Wake.

343
00:53:27,573 --> 00:53:29,086
When can you sail?

344
00:53:30,013 --> 00:53:33,722
Well, the <i>Enterprise</i> can sail
tomorrow morning.

345
00:53:35,133 --> 00:53:39,763
I'll need a day or two. We're just
completing repairs on the <i>Lexington.</i>

346
00:53:39,973 --> 00:53:41,645
Hurry things along, John.

347
00:53:41,853 --> 00:53:43,650
I want you out there to probe.

348
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:46,572
I want planes up in the air
morning and afternoon.

349
00:53:46,773 --> 00:53:50,163
I want a report on any sign
of hostile ships.

350
00:53:50,373 --> 00:53:51,328
Understood.

351
00:53:51,933 --> 00:53:53,252
Do you want battleships along?

352
00:53:53,493 --> 00:53:55,165
Hell, no. They're too slow.

353
00:53:55,373 --> 00:53:57,250
If we're gonna probe, let's probe.

354
00:53:57,493 --> 00:53:59,529
We don't want anything holding us up.

355
00:53:59,733 --> 00:54:03,123
You're right, but I'm not ready
to commit them myself.

356
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:05,085
Not until I know when and where.

357
00:54:05,293 --> 00:54:08,490
Do you plan to keep half the fleet
at sea while the carriers are gone?

358
00:54:08,693 --> 00:54:10,570
No, it's too risky.

359
00:54:10,773 --> 00:54:14,163
I'll have to keep the fleet
here at Pearl while you're away.

360
00:54:14,373 --> 00:54:17,092
Get out. Get back as soon as you can.

361
00:54:17,293 --> 00:54:21,252
I don't like the idea of having my
battleships without air cover.

362
00:54:21,773 --> 00:54:25,049
- Let's get going.
- Yes, sir.

363
00:54:33,733 --> 00:54:35,007
Kimmel.

364
00:54:36,133 --> 00:54:37,771
Level with me.

365
00:54:38,973 --> 00:54:40,770
I want a clear directive.

366
00:54:41,933 --> 00:54:44,891
If I run into a Jap ship,
what action do I take?

367
00:54:47,533 --> 00:54:49,330
Use your common sense.

368
00:54:52,613 --> 00:54:55,173
That's the best damn order I ever had.

369
00:54:58,373 --> 00:55:02,491
If I see so much as a sampan there...

370
00:55:02,693 --> 00:55:04,206
...I'll blow it out of the water.

371
00:55:49,613 --> 00:55:51,763
What is it this time,
getting me over here?

372
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:54,692
Tokyo has alerted their embassy
to stand by...

373
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:58,203
...for a very long message
in 14 parts.

374
00:55:58,853 --> 00:56:02,050
Look, Rufe, you scared me
and everybody else last week.

375
00:56:02,253 --> 00:56:04,483
We're not doing that again, are we?

376
00:56:04,693 --> 00:56:05,762
You should see this.

377
00:56:05,973 --> 00:56:09,329
It's the latest report on those
Japanese troop transports.

378
00:56:13,893 --> 00:56:15,246
Remember those troop ships?

379
00:56:15,493 --> 00:56:17,768
They're still heading south
with an escort...

380
00:56:17,973 --> 00:56:21,124
...only 14 hours
from the coast of Malaya.

381
00:56:24,133 --> 00:56:25,885
What about their aircraft carriers?

382
00:56:26,093 --> 00:56:27,526
We don't know.

383
00:56:28,213 --> 00:56:31,603
Intelligence was keeping track
of them until recently.

384
00:56:31,813 --> 00:56:33,565
Now we've lost them.

385
00:56:34,013 --> 00:56:37,847
Look, Rufe, try to put yourself
in their minds.

386
00:56:38,053 --> 00:56:42,046
Where do you think I have been
the past week, night and day?

387
00:56:42,853 --> 00:56:46,050
I am still convinced they're
going to attack us.

388
00:56:48,053 --> 00:56:50,169
What can we do that we
aren't doing already?

389
00:56:52,093 --> 00:56:55,085
I don't know about you,
but I know what I'm gonna do.

390
00:56:57,093 --> 00:56:58,367
Where is everybody?

391
00:56:58,613 --> 00:57:01,127
Oh, it's past 1 <i>2,</i> sir.
They've already gone.

392
00:57:01,333 --> 00:57:03,244
- Get them back.
- On the weekend?

393
00:57:03,493 --> 00:57:05,245
Yes, on the weekend.

394
00:59:08,373 --> 00:59:10,011
This completes 13 parts?

395
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:13,683
Yes, Tokyo is holding
the final part till morning.

396
00:59:14,293 --> 00:59:16,011
I wonder why.

397
00:59:18,093 --> 00:59:19,242
It's almost 9.

398
00:59:19,493 --> 00:59:23,122
Harry, I'm going to make the
rounds with what we have here.

399
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:26,370
Thank God the president's
back on the list.

400
00:59:27,853 --> 00:59:30,731
Have Brotherhood call me
when the missing part is in.

401
00:59:30,933 --> 00:59:32,286
Right.

402
00:59:51,373 --> 00:59:52,806
You're late.

403
00:59:53,213 --> 00:59:56,125
- Well, I was...
- Please, take me to the White House.

404
01:00:06,093 --> 01:00:10,086
If you told me we were invited to the
White House, I would've dressed.

405
01:00:11,653 --> 01:00:13,211
You know Mrs. Roosevelt.

406
01:00:13,413 --> 01:00:16,610
She's informal personally,
but a stickler for protocol...

407
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:19,611
Darling, will you shut up and drive?

408
01:01:59,573 --> 01:02:00,972
Well?

409
01:02:01,373 --> 01:02:03,250
Captain Wilkinson's.

410
01:02:09,413 --> 01:02:11,005
Did you see the president?

411
01:02:11,213 --> 01:02:14,762
No, I saw Harry Hopkins.

412
01:02:14,973 --> 01:02:17,089
And did he read the, whatever it is?

413
01:02:17,653 --> 01:02:20,486
No, he doesn't have the key.

414
01:02:21,413 --> 01:02:24,086
I gave the pouch to our Naval aide,
Lt. Schulz.

415
01:02:24,293 --> 01:02:26,204
He took it in to the president.

416
01:02:26,693 --> 01:02:29,287
And the president has a key,
I suppose?

417
01:02:30,773 --> 01:02:32,286
Of course he has.

418
01:02:32,893 --> 01:02:35,532
And did Lieutenant Schulz
say anything?

419
01:02:35,853 --> 01:02:37,252
He said, "Thank you."

420
01:02:37,973 --> 01:02:40,089
Darling, step on it, will you?

421
01:03:18,213 --> 01:03:21,842
Admiral Stark can't be reached.
Should I take it to chief of staff?

422
01:03:22,053 --> 01:03:25,932
It's after 10, General Marshall
always retires early.

423
01:03:33,973 --> 01:03:38,569
I see no reason to disturb Marshall
with something that's incomplete.

424
01:03:39,133 --> 01:03:43,524
- Wait till you have the final part.
- Yes, sir.

425
01:03:43,893 --> 01:03:45,042
If you're so concerned...

426
01:03:45,253 --> 01:03:48,290
...why don't we call chief of war
plans, Admiral Turner?

427
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:51,001
His telephone doesn't answer, sir.

428
01:03:51,213 --> 01:03:54,205
- You don't happen to know where he is?
- No idea.

429
01:04:04,613 --> 01:04:08,242
The president has already
discussed it with me.

430
01:04:08,493 --> 01:04:11,326
He sent a personal message
to the emperor.

431
01:04:11,573 --> 01:04:15,646
But when the final part of this
comes in, I'd like to see it then.

432
01:04:15,853 --> 01:04:19,084
- Good night, commander.
- Good night, sir.

433
01:04:28,093 --> 01:04:30,209
I was starved. I'll bet you are.

434
01:04:30,413 --> 01:04:32,483
Oh, thank you, dear.

435
01:04:35,853 --> 01:04:37,923
Can't you tell me anything?

436
01:04:38,133 --> 01:04:39,532
Even a hint?

437
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:46,805
You'd think the world
was falling apart.

438
01:04:47,013 --> 01:04:49,766
Admiral Stark talked to the president.

439
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:52,730
What did the president say?

440
01:04:55,533 --> 01:04:58,730
He sent a personal message
to the emperor.

441
01:05:26,893 --> 01:05:28,087
Gordy.

442
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:32,291
We got those B-17s coming in
from California in the morning.

443
01:05:32,533 --> 01:05:35,127
Honolulu radio will stay on
the air all night...

444
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:36,732
...so the planes can home in.

445
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:40,562
You and I had better be in that
control tower at 7:30 sharp.

446
01:05:40,773 --> 01:05:42,047
Yes, sir.

447
01:05:50,773 --> 01:05:54,163
- Tyler, I've got a job for you.
- Sir.

448
01:05:54,373 --> 01:05:58,082
Report to the new radar center
at Fort Shafter at 0400.

449
01:05:58,293 --> 01:06:00,045
At 4:00 in the morning?

450
01:06:00,253 --> 01:06:01,971
From 4 to 7 a.m.

451
01:06:02,173 --> 01:06:05,165
Our marvel of science
only operates for three hours.

452
01:06:05,373 --> 01:06:07,841
Lucky boy. Lucky boy!

453
01:06:19,333 --> 01:06:22,131
Captain, how's it feel?
First command, first patrol.

454
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:24,289
Just fine, Mr. Young.

455
01:06:28,293 --> 01:06:31,365
In fact, I think I'll
turn in for a while.

456
01:06:36,813 --> 01:06:38,769
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

457
01:08:27,293 --> 01:08:28,612
Here you are.

458
01:08:29,493 --> 01:08:30,482
Kramer.

459
01:08:30,693 --> 01:08:32,206
Al, listen to this.

460
01:08:32,413 --> 01:08:33,892
The fourteenth part.

461
01:08:34,093 --> 01:08:36,653
"Will the ambassadors please
submit our reply...

462
01:08:36,853 --> 01:08:40,368
...to the United States government
at precisely 1 p. M...

463
01:08:40,613 --> 01:08:42,524
...December 7th, your time."

464
01:08:42,893 --> 01:08:44,406
1 p. M?

465
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:48,362
"Precisely 1 p.m., your time."

466
01:08:49,893 --> 01:08:50,928
I'll be right over.

467
01:09:09,253 --> 01:09:12,609
Look at the president's message.
I should have had it hours ago.

468
01:09:12,813 --> 01:09:15,532
As you know, communications
have been delayed...

469
01:09:15,733 --> 01:09:17,371
...and frequently garbled lately.

470
01:09:17,573 --> 01:09:20,167
Or deliberately interfered with.

471
01:09:22,653 --> 01:09:26,612
Gene, call the foreign minister.

472
01:09:28,533 --> 01:09:31,764
Tell him I want an immediate
audience with the emperor.

473
01:10:34,133 --> 01:10:36,124
"After deciphering...

474
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:39,530

...all codes...

...and secret documents."

479
01:10:59,413 --> 01:11:00,846
Translate this immediately.

480
01:11:01,053 --> 01:11:03,521
- Give a copy to Kramer when he comes.
- Yes, sir.

481
01:11:03,733 --> 01:11:05,485
I've got to get the hell out of here.

482
01:12:22,973 --> 01:12:24,565
Hey, look at this.

483
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:27,164
Finally got one.

484
01:12:32,013 --> 01:12:33,162
<i>Communication center.</i>

485
01:12:33,373 --> 01:12:34,328
It even works.

486
01:12:34,573 --> 01:12:35,801
That's great.

487
01:12:36,013 --> 01:12:38,527
Opana Point, communications check.

488
01:12:40,373 --> 01:12:41,601
<i>Are you reading us?</i>

489
01:12:41,813 --> 01:12:43,804
Coming in loud and clear.

490
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:49,642
Where's the general?

491
01:12:49,853 --> 01:12:51,684
It's Sunday, sir.

492
01:13:05,853 --> 01:13:07,286
This is Colonel Bratton.

493
01:13:07,533 --> 01:13:10,366
Connect me with Chief of Staff,
General Marshall.

494
01:13:10,613 --> 01:13:13,605
Yes, at his quarters, Fort Myer.

495
01:13:18,173 --> 01:13:20,971
Chief of staff's quarters,
Sergeant Aguirre speaking.

496
01:13:21,813 --> 01:13:23,326
Yes, Colonel Bratton.

497
01:13:24,493 --> 01:13:26,882
I'm sorry, sir,
the general isn't here.

498
01:13:27,733 --> 01:13:30,531
Where he always is
this time Sunday morning.

499
01:13:46,893 --> 01:13:49,851
- Where's Colonel Bratton?
- Gone to see General Marshall.

500
01:13:50,053 --> 01:13:52,009
He left this for you, sir.

501
01:14:49,333 --> 01:14:51,767
The 14th part of this
intercept Kramer...

502
01:14:51,973 --> 01:14:55,807
...just delivered indicates to me
the Japanese are going to attack.

503
01:14:58,253 --> 01:14:59,845
We know war is coming.

504
01:15:00,053 --> 01:15:03,489
We know they have
an expeditionary force heading south.

505
01:15:05,173 --> 01:15:07,641
Sir, as hostilities seem imminent...

506
01:15:07,853 --> 01:15:10,128
...I recommend you telephone
Admiral Kimmel...

507
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:11,971
...in Hawaii.

508
01:15:29,053 --> 01:15:30,406
No.

509
01:15:32,373 --> 01:15:34,807
I better call the president first.

510
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:39,124
Now, if you'll all please excuse me?

511
01:15:39,333 --> 01:15:42,131
- Yes, sir.
- Thanks.

512
01:24:25,946 --> 01:24:28,744
"The Japanese government regrets
to have to notify...

513
01:24:28,946 --> 01:24:30,743
...the American government...

514
01:24:30,946 --> 01:24:33,858
...that, in view of the attitude
of the American government...

515
01:24:34,066 --> 01:24:36,102
...it is impossible to reach...

516
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:40,022
...an agreement
through negotiations."

517
01:24:40,786 --> 01:24:43,778
- There are supplemental messages.
- Thank you.

518
01:24:54,586 --> 01:24:57,658
Gentlemen, I am convinced
the Japanese intend to attack...

519
01:24:57,866 --> 01:25:00,221
...at or shortly after 1:00 today.

520
01:25:00,466 --> 01:25:03,378
- I'll alert all Pacific commands.
- Yes, sir.

521
01:25:13,186 --> 01:25:15,461
Colonel Bratton, just a minute.

522
01:25:15,786 --> 01:25:18,254
Take this to communications center.

523
01:25:49,866 --> 01:25:51,299
Come in.

524
01:25:52,106 --> 01:25:54,017
Captain, can you come to the bridge?

525
01:25:54,226 --> 01:25:55,739
Very well.

526
01:26:00,266 --> 01:26:01,745
Sub contact, Mr. Goepner?

527
01:26:01,946 --> 01:26:03,299
- We're not sure.
- What ship?

528
01:26:03,546 --> 01:26:05,537
The Navy tug <i>Antares.</i>

529
01:26:06,786 --> 01:26:08,265
Look astern of her, captain.

530
01:26:09,586 --> 01:26:11,224
She's towing a target raft.

531
01:26:11,466 --> 01:26:13,775
Look between the ship
and the raft, sir.

532
01:26:23,106 --> 01:26:25,336
That, Mr. Goepner, is a submarine.

533
01:26:25,586 --> 01:26:28,737
She's sneaking through the net
into the harbor. General Quarters.

534
01:26:28,946 --> 01:26:31,506
- Sound General Quarters.
- All engines ahead, full.

535
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:53,261
- Come left, 15 degrees.
- Come left 15 degrees, sir.

536
01:26:53,546 --> 01:26:56,344
- Tell <i>Antares</i> we're attacking.
- Aye, aye, sir.

537
01:27:01,266 --> 01:27:03,575
Flags, tell <i>Antares</i> we're attacking.

538
01:27:10,866 --> 01:27:13,903
- Mount one, commence firing.
- Mount one, commence firing.

539
01:27:32,266 --> 01:27:35,542
- Stand by to roll depth charges.
- Stand by to roll depth charges.

540
01:27:40,266 --> 01:27:42,097
- Roll one.
- Roll one.

541
01:27:50,066 --> 01:27:52,102
- Roll two.
- Roll two.

542
01:28:05,866 --> 01:28:10,144
Notify Com-14 we dropped depth charges
on a sub in our security zone.

543
01:28:10,346 --> 01:28:11,779
Aye, aye, sir.

544
01:28:30,346 --> 01:28:31,825
Captain Earle speaking.

545
01:28:32,306 --> 01:28:35,855
- We have a message from the ward.
- All right, read it to me.

546
01:28:36,666 --> 01:28:41,740
"Have dropped depth charges on sub
operating in our security zone."

547
01:28:42,946 --> 01:28:46,097
We've had so many of these
false sightings, Kaminsky.

548
01:28:46,306 --> 01:28:48,024
But this is the real thing, sir.

549
01:28:48,226 --> 01:28:50,103
Closer than any previous sighting.

550
01:28:50,306 --> 01:28:51,705
Just off the harbor entrance.

551
01:28:52,666 --> 01:28:55,863
You and I know the skipper
of that destroyer is a green kid.

552
01:28:56,066 --> 01:28:57,385
I'll pass it to Admiral Block.

553
01:28:57,626 --> 01:29:01,460
With all do respect, sir, I think
we should alert all commanders.

554
01:29:02,026 --> 01:29:06,975
Confirmation, Kaminsky.
I want confirmation.

555
01:29:56,866 --> 01:29:57,901
This is hot.

556
01:29:58,106 --> 01:30:01,621
General Marshall wants it sent to
all commanders by the fastest route.

557
01:30:01,826 --> 01:30:03,225
Right.

558
01:30:06,666 --> 01:30:09,942
The general's handwriting:
It's hard to read.

559
01:30:11,626 --> 01:30:13,981
You're gonna have to help me
with it, Rufe.

560
01:31:43,266 --> 01:31:46,781
Major, I picked up
some great music from Honolulu.

561
01:31:47,226 --> 01:31:49,296
That's fine, pipe it through.

562
01:32:07,986 --> 01:32:10,375
Where's the damn chow truck?

563
01:32:12,946 --> 01:32:15,824
Shut the thing down, George.
It's already after 7.

564
01:32:16,026 --> 01:32:17,823
Hey, Joe, come here.

565
01:32:18,546 --> 01:32:19,979
What do you make of that?

566
01:32:20,186 --> 01:32:22,017
I've been watching it for minutes.

567
01:32:22,226 --> 01:32:23,978
It's moving in, fast.

568
01:32:24,186 --> 01:32:26,222
I've never seen anything that big.

569
01:32:26,466 --> 01:32:29,299
- Looks like two main pulses.
- Hey, Joe, I got it.

570
01:32:29,506 --> 01:32:34,455
I make that about 140 miles north,
three degrees east.

571
01:32:35,306 --> 01:32:38,139
Don't make sense,
we got no planes out that far.

572
01:32:38,466 --> 01:32:40,457
We gotta contact
the information center.

573
01:32:40,666 --> 01:32:42,702
Our problem is over at 7:00.

574
01:32:42,906 --> 01:32:45,374
The center might make
some sense out of it.

575
01:32:45,866 --> 01:32:47,982
Okay, suit yourself.

576
01:32:57,386 --> 01:32:59,183
Information center.

577
01:33:00,946 --> 01:33:03,858
I don't know, Mac,
we're all closed down here.

578
01:33:04,626 --> 01:33:06,742
Is that right? Hang on a minute.

579
01:33:06,946 --> 01:33:08,618
Lieutenant, sir.

580
01:33:15,866 --> 01:33:16,901
Lieutenant Tyler.

581
01:33:17,106 --> 01:33:19,540
Sir, this is Private Elliot,
Opana Point.

582
01:33:19,746 --> 01:33:22,101
There's a large formation
of planes coming in...

583
01:33:22,306 --> 01:33:24,979
...140 miles, three degrees east.

584
01:33:27,546 --> 01:33:30,936
Well, don't worry about it.

585
01:33:33,346 --> 01:33:36,258
The boys at Opana Point must have
picked up the B-17s...

586
01:33:36,506 --> 01:33:38,064
...coming in from the mainland.

587
01:33:39,866 --> 01:33:43,256
- He said not to worry about it.
- Come on, let's go eat.

588
01:33:50,546 --> 01:33:54,824
General, I sent this to Manila,
the canal zone and San Francisco...

589
01:33:55,026 --> 01:33:57,586
...but the direct channel
to Hawaii is out.

590
01:33:57,786 --> 01:33:59,299
Atmospherics again?

591
01:33:59,546 --> 01:34:02,140
Yes, sir, it's real bad today.

592
01:34:02,346 --> 01:34:04,496
We could give it to the Navy.

593
01:34:04,706 --> 01:34:07,584
What makes you think
their atmospherics are better?

594
01:34:09,706 --> 01:34:12,743
- Send it as a telegram.
- Yes, sir.

595
01:35:15,506 --> 01:35:18,782
Do you mean a submarine was
cited over half an hour ago...

596
01:35:18,986 --> 01:35:22,023
...and that it's taken
this long to report it to me?

597
01:35:23,026 --> 01:35:26,177
I don't care if it
still hasn't been confirmed.

598
01:35:26,386 --> 01:35:29,981
I should've been informed after
the ward radioed a first report.

599
01:35:30,186 --> 01:35:33,861
A submarine that close is a serious
matter. A very serious matter.

600
01:35:34,066 --> 01:35:36,739
Get the confirmation
or reports to my office.

601
01:35:36,946 --> 01:35:40,177
I mean, right now.
Have my driver get the car.

602
01:35:40,386 --> 01:35:41,899
Aye, aye, sir. Oh, sir...

603
01:35:42,106 --> 01:35:44,939
...should I tell General Short
you'll miss the golf date?

604
01:35:45,146 --> 01:35:47,979
No, damn it, get my car.

605
01:35:53,586 --> 01:35:55,816
A message for the general
at Fort Shafter.

606
01:35:56,026 --> 01:35:58,494
- Is it marked urgent?
- No.

607
01:36:48,986 --> 01:36:50,738
It's a little bumpy, Davey...

608
01:36:50,946 --> 01:36:53,176
...but you have to fly
in all kinds of weather.

609
01:36:53,386 --> 01:36:55,058
Sure, Miss Fort.

610
01:37:11,946 --> 01:37:13,823
Don't let the nose drop.

611
01:37:14,026 --> 01:37:17,985
That's better.
You're doing just fine.

612
01:37:36,986 --> 01:37:39,136
I'm taking over, Davey.

613
01:40:30,546 --> 01:40:32,218
Stand by.

614
01:41:35,386 --> 01:41:36,899
Execute.

615
01:42:32,706 --> 01:42:35,778
Get his number.
I'll report him for safety violations.

616
01:43:08,906 --> 01:43:10,180
Come on!

617
01:43:15,586 --> 01:43:18,180
Alert all commands:

618
01:43:19,266 --> 01:43:22,144
"Air raid. Pearl Harbor.

619
01:43:22,786 --> 01:43:25,300
This is no drill."

620
01:43:53,986 --> 01:43:55,624
<i>General Quarters.</i>

621
01:43:57,346 --> 01:44:00,702
<i>Man your stations.</i>
<i>Man your stations.</i>

622
01:44:06,906 --> 01:44:08,100
Sir.

623
01:44:24,946 --> 01:44:27,141
<i>Battle stations. Battle stations.</i>

624
01:44:35,306 --> 01:44:38,696
Fire your gun. Fire at will.

625
01:44:39,306 --> 01:44:40,261
That bastard!

626
01:44:57,586 --> 01:45:00,054
<i>Station six, man your pump.</i>

627
01:45:10,786 --> 01:45:12,014
<i>Plane to starboard.</i>

628
01:45:26,466 --> 01:45:28,024
Pearl Harbor is being attacked.

629
01:45:28,226 --> 01:45:30,694
- Pearl Harbor?
- Pearl Harbor is being bombed.

630
01:45:30,906 --> 01:45:32,385
Pearl Harbor's being attacked.

631
01:45:32,626 --> 01:45:35,743
Go back to your quarters.
Pearl Harbor's being attacked.

632
01:46:16,626 --> 01:46:18,821
What in the hell is going on?

633
01:46:19,946 --> 01:46:21,777
Why wasn't the Army notified?

634
01:46:21,986 --> 01:46:26,218
Did anyone think to inform Washington?
I thought so.

635
01:46:26,466 --> 01:46:28,582
- General.
- Put all units on a full war footing.

636
01:46:28,786 --> 01:46:30,299
Alert the territorial guard.

637
01:46:30,546 --> 01:46:32,184
Open a command post
at Aliamanu Crater.

638
01:46:32,386 --> 01:46:34,183
- Yes, sir.
- I'll be right down.

639
01:46:40,106 --> 01:46:41,937
Oh, my God.

640
01:46:42,786 --> 01:46:43,901
The island's under attack.

641
01:46:44,106 --> 01:46:46,495
Those bastards will kill us all.

642
01:46:47,946 --> 01:46:50,335
Men, get to the armory.
Get guns, ammunition.

643
01:46:50,546 --> 01:46:52,537
- You too, lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

644
01:46:58,786 --> 01:47:01,061
- Operator.
- Duarte airfield.

645
01:47:01,266 --> 01:47:03,257
All the phone lines are jammed.

646
01:47:03,506 --> 01:47:05,656
Well, try the radio again.

647
01:47:34,506 --> 01:47:35,461
Hose down that plane.

648
01:47:49,746 --> 01:47:50,701
Run for it.

649
01:47:50,906 --> 01:47:52,498
Run, run!

650
01:48:00,026 --> 01:48:00,856
There's Hickam.

651
01:48:01,066 --> 01:48:04,103
Major, I heard something
funny on the Honolulu radio.

652
01:48:08,706 --> 01:48:10,458
What kind of traffic control is this?

653
01:48:10,666 --> 01:48:12,816
The radio said
something about an attack.

654
01:48:13,026 --> 01:48:14,539
They're Japs, sir.

655
01:48:18,386 --> 01:48:22,095
What a way to fly into a war.
Unarmed and out of gas.

656
01:48:22,306 --> 01:48:24,058
Oboe leader to Oboe flight.

657
01:48:24,266 --> 01:48:27,178
We've flown into the middle of a war.
Get out fast.

658
01:48:27,386 --> 01:48:30,696
Anywhere. If you can't make
Hickam, try Bellows or Wheeler.

659
01:48:42,346 --> 01:48:43,745
We've been hit.
Nothing serious.

660
01:48:43,946 --> 01:48:45,345
They shot one circuit box.

661
01:48:45,546 --> 01:48:47,457
The landing light isn't working.

662
01:48:47,666 --> 01:48:49,736
Better use the hand crank. Hurry.

663
01:49:12,706 --> 01:49:14,185
- Major.
- Yeah.

664
01:49:14,386 --> 01:49:15,535
One wheel is stuck.

665
01:49:15,946 --> 01:49:18,335
Well, jolt it loose. We're going in.

666
01:49:18,626 --> 01:49:20,617
- I tried.
- Try again!

667
01:49:23,986 --> 01:49:26,102
Here they come. Fire!

668
01:49:32,746 --> 01:49:35,306
Tell them to stop shooting at us!
We're Americans.

669
01:49:42,186 --> 01:49:44,381
Major, no go, sir.

670
01:49:46,346 --> 01:49:49,383
Like I said, it's a hell of a way
to fly into a war.

671
01:50:15,306 --> 01:50:16,705
- Run for it!
- Hurry up!

672
01:50:20,146 --> 01:50:22,216
Tower to B-17,
there's a Jap on your tail.

673
01:50:22,466 --> 01:50:24,104
Goose your engine and get out.

674
01:51:59,026 --> 01:52:01,540
Have damage control report
all damages.

675
01:52:01,746 --> 01:52:04,101
Sir, if we stay here we're gonna fry.

676
01:52:04,306 --> 01:52:06,501
Okay, sergeant,
let's get the men down.

677
01:52:06,706 --> 01:52:08,662
All right, you guys, let's go.

678
01:52:09,066 --> 01:52:11,296
Where the hell are our fighters?

679
01:52:33,786 --> 01:52:37,256
Captain, the main fuel tanks
are fractured.

680
01:52:37,506 --> 01:52:39,701
Lower deck's flooded,
we're listing 8 degrees.

681
01:52:39,906 --> 01:52:41,624
Counter flood, counter flood.

682
01:52:51,706 --> 01:52:54,504
You wanted confirmation, captain?
Take a look.

683
01:52:54,706 --> 01:52:56,458
There's your confirmation!

684
01:53:03,706 --> 01:53:05,742
<i>"Oklahoma,</i> capsized.

685
01:53:06,986 --> 01:53:09,819
<i>Nevada 's</i> taken a torpedo forward
and is down to the head.

686
01:53:10,026 --> 01:53:13,985
<i>West Virginia,</i> subjected to six
torpedo hits and several deck fires.

687
01:53:14,186 --> 01:53:16,575
<i>Raleigh</i> and <i>Helena</i>
damaged and listing."

688
01:53:16,786 --> 01:53:21,576
The <i>California,</i> two torpedoes, fires
all around, temporarily abandoned.

689
01:53:21,786 --> 01:53:22,741
I've just come from her.

690
01:54:32,666 --> 01:54:34,622
It's spent, sir.

691
01:54:41,906 --> 01:54:44,295
Would've been merciful
had it killed me.

692
01:55:36,586 --> 01:55:38,144
Mr. Secretary.

693
01:55:40,306 --> 01:55:44,299
"Air raid. Pearl Harbor.
This is no drill."

694
01:55:44,546 --> 01:55:47,697
No, this can't be true.
They must mean the Philippines.

695
01:55:47,906 --> 01:55:50,978
No, sir. It's Pearl.

696
01:55:53,186 --> 01:55:55,336
Get me the White House,
the direct line.

697
01:55:55,546 --> 01:55:56,899
Yes, sir.

698
01:56:02,066 --> 01:56:06,184
Mr. Ambassador, Mr. Hull will see you
in a moment. Please be seated.

699
01:56:10,706 --> 01:56:14,335
Mr. President,
has this been confirmed?

700
01:56:14,586 --> 01:56:17,464
Then, sir
I'd like you to have it confirmed...

701
01:56:17,666 --> 01:56:21,454
...before I receive Nomura and Kurusu.

702
01:56:21,666 --> 01:56:23,258
They're waiting outside.

703
01:57:22,026 --> 01:57:26,338
Operator. Operator.
Get me Haleiwa field. Fast.

704
01:57:26,586 --> 01:57:29,942
George, get ahold of a car,
a truck, anything.

705
01:57:30,146 --> 01:57:34,298
I'm calling Haleiwa. I'll get them
to start our planes. Go.

706
01:59:56,786 --> 01:59:59,220
Recommend course <i>2-</i> 3-0, sir.

707
01:59:59,466 --> 02:00:02,538
- Very well. Stay at <i>2-</i> 3-0.
- Stay at <i>2-</i> 3-0, sir.

708
02:00:47,306 --> 02:00:48,625
Take cover!

709
02:01:04,546 --> 02:01:06,104
More hose! More hose!

710
02:01:20,026 --> 02:01:21,459
More water.

711
02:01:24,546 --> 02:01:27,379
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

712
02:01:39,146 --> 02:01:43,219
- Abandon ship! Abandon Ship!
- Over the side!

713
02:01:47,306 --> 02:01:49,866
Can't get through
the outer channel in this shape.

714
02:01:50,066 --> 02:01:52,899
She goes down here,
she'll block the south channel.

715
02:01:53,106 --> 02:01:55,301
We'll have to beach her
there so she's clear.

716
02:05:32,346 --> 02:05:33,699
File these.

717
02:05:46,546 --> 02:05:47,979
G-5.

718
02:05:54,066 --> 02:05:55,977
I need five copies each.

719
02:05:58,346 --> 02:05:59,859
Messenger.

720
02:06:01,906 --> 02:06:04,466
- Take this to General Short's office.
- Right.

721
02:06:05,706 --> 02:06:07,185
File these.

722
02:06:20,226 --> 02:06:21,545
Corporal.

723
02:06:21,866 --> 02:06:23,936
This has to be decoded
for the general.

724
02:06:24,146 --> 02:06:27,900
Take it to the decoding room.
Ask them to send it back soon.

725
02:06:48,106 --> 02:06:49,619
Run for it!

726
02:06:56,626 --> 02:06:59,220
Drop the hose
and get the ladders and axes.

727
02:07:00,186 --> 02:07:01,460
What are you waiting for?

728
02:07:01,666 --> 02:07:03,577
- We got no water.
- Why? What's wrong?

729
02:07:03,786 --> 02:07:06,300
It's the <i>Arizona.</i>
She cut the pipes in the mains.

730
02:07:06,546 --> 02:07:09,344
The tanker in the ocean there
is full of aviation fuel.

731
02:07:09,546 --> 02:07:11,502
If it goes, we'll blow up the harbor.

732
02:08:13,826 --> 02:08:15,179
Hey, look out!

733
02:08:34,106 --> 02:08:38,702
In all my 50 years
of public service...

734
02:08:40,306 --> 02:08:44,265
...I have never seen a document so
crowded with infamous falsehoods...

735
02:08:44,506 --> 02:08:46,178
...and distortions...

736
02:08:46,826 --> 02:08:49,056
...on a scale so huge...

737
02:08:49,266 --> 02:08:52,099
...that I never imagined
until today...

738
02:08:52,986 --> 02:08:55,500
...that any government
on this planet...

739
02:08:55,706 --> 02:08:58,345
...was capable of uttering them.

740
02:09:11,386 --> 02:09:12,785
Mr. Hull.

741
02:09:14,866 --> 02:09:16,219
Go.

742
02:13:07,466 --> 02:13:09,184
Yes, all right.

743
02:13:09,386 --> 02:13:13,379
This came from the decoding room,
a cablegram from the War Department.

744
02:13:25,986 --> 02:13:28,295
Get a copy to Admiral Kimmel.

745
02:13:45,146 --> 02:13:46,340
Pardon me, admiral.

746
02:13:46,586 --> 02:13:48,941
- From Washington.
- Thank you.

747
02:13:56,106 --> 02:13:57,744
Gentlemen.

748
02:14:03,866 --> 02:14:07,097
"The Japanese are presenting
at 1 p. M...

749
02:14:07,306 --> 02:14:09,661
...Eastern Standard Time today...

750
02:14:10,346 --> 02:14:12,576
...what amounts to an ultimatum.

751
02:14:14,826 --> 02:14:19,616
Just what significance the hour set
may have, we do not know...

752
02:14:21,626 --> 02:14:24,459
...but be on alert accordingly."

753
02:14:25,866 --> 02:14:27,299
Signed...

754
02:14:27,906 --> 02:14:32,058
...George C. Marshall,
chief of staff.

755
02:14:40,826 --> 02:14:42,623
My God.

756
02:14:57,466 --> 02:15:01,254
This leaves the Navy with only two
combat groups in the Central Pacific.

757
02:15:01,506 --> 02:15:03,701
Ours and the <i>Lexington.</i>

758
02:15:04,106 --> 02:15:06,062
We don't want to get caught
like they did.

759
02:15:06,266 --> 02:15:09,463
I don't intend to.
When can you be ready for sea again?

760
02:15:09,666 --> 02:15:12,703
We can fuel and provision
and be on the way before dawn.

761
02:15:12,906 --> 02:15:15,864
Good. That's good.
