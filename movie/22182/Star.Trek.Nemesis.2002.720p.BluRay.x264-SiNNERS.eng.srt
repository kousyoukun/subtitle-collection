2
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,363
Senators, consider

3
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,733
the opportunities
for the Empire.

4
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,637
At last, the destinies
of the planets

5
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:49,233
Romulus and Remus
will be united.

6
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,867
Shinzon of Remus is offering us

7
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,741
a chance
to make ourselves stronger

8
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,576
than ever before.

9
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,606
lt would be madness
to reject it.

10
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,347
l beg you not to let
prejudice or politics

11
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,947
interfere with this Alliance.

12
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:06,958
By joining Shinzon's
forces with ours,

13
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:10,325
not even the Federation will
be able to stand in our way.

14
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:11,489
That's enough!

15
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,658
The decision has been made.

16
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,261
The military does not
dictate policy on Romulus.

17
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,237
The Senate has considered

18
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:20,739
Shinzon's proposal
and rejected it.

19
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,333
He and his followers will be met

20
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,276
with all deliberate force
and sent back

21
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,939
to that black rock
they came from.

22
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,778
Do l make myself clear?

23
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,945
Yes, sir.

24
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,726
lf you will excuse me,
Praetor,

25
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:48,529
l have an appointment
with the Tholian Ambassador.

26
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,502
Of course.

27
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:56,303
Senators, are there
any others who wish to speak?

28
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,003
Then l call for a vote

29
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:01,138
on the motion
to open trade negotiations

30
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,580
with Celes ll.

31
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,480
As you know, the Reman mines
have not been

32
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,314
filling their quotas
for months now.

33
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,944
l hope you will all
bear in mind

34
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,477
the Trade Committee's findings.

35
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,581
As much as we don't want...

36
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:43,187
Would someone alert Security?

37
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,657
Bring back Senator Tal'aura.

38
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,945
Duty.

39
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:21,825
A starship captain's life
is filled with solemn duty.

40
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:24,659
l have commanded men in battle.

41
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:29,566
l have negotiated peace treaties
between implacable enemies.

42
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,366
l have represented
the Federation

43
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:35,704
in First Contact
with 27 alien species.

44
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:40,008
But none of this compares
with my solemn duty today...

45
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,304
as best man.

46
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,777
Now, l know
on an occasion such as this,

47
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,380
it is expected
that l be gracious

48
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,790
and fulsome in my praise
on the wonders

49
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:54,952
of this blessed union.

50
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,552
But have the two
of you considered

51
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,621
what you are doing to me?!

52
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,298
Of course, you're happy,

53
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,268
but what about my needs?

54
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:07,672
This is all
a damned inconvenience.

55
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:11,609
l mean, while you are happily
settling in on the Titan,

56
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,943
l will be training
my new First Officer.

57
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,245
You all know him.

58
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:20,878
He's a tyrannical martinet
who will never, ever allow me

59
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,410
to go on away missions.

60
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,888
That is the regulation, sir.

61
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,584
Starfleet Code Section 12,
Paragraph Four...

62
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,649
Mr. Data?

63
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:27,660
Sir?

64
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:28,922
Shut up.

65
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:30,326
Yes, sir.

66
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:35,890
15 years l've been waiting
to say that.

67
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,926
No, seriously.

68
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,130
Will, Deanna,

69
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,834
there's still time
to reconsider.

70
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,068
Yes?

71
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,600
-No.
-No.

72
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,203
No?

73
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,680
Oh, very well, then.

74
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:56,520
Will Riker, you have been
my trusted right arm

75
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,080
for 15 years.

76
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:03,892
You have kept my course true
and steady.

77
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,797
Deanna Troi,
you've been my guide

78
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,460
and my conscience.

79
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:14,565
You have helped me recognize
the better parts of myself.

80
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,507
You are my family.

81
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,206
And in best maritime tradition,

82
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:26,184
l wish you both clear horizons.

83
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,914
My good friends...

84
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,615
make it so.

85
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,388
The bride and groom!

86
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,824
To the bride and groom.

87
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,577
You ever think
about getting married again?

88
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:55,979
No.

89
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,277
23 was my limit.

90
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,548
Worf?

91
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,851
Are you all right?

92
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,291
Romulan ale should be illegal.

93
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,658
lt is.

94
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,553
That was a lovely toast.

95
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,724
lt was from the heart.

96
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:14,892
And you needn't worry.

97
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,834
l'm going to brief
your new Counselor

98
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,496
on everything she needs to know.

99
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,937
Oh, like hell you are.

100
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,507
You already know
too much about me.

101
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,772
But l take it that there will be

102
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,837
no speeches during the ceremony
on Betazed.

103
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,284
No, no speeches and no clothes.

104
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,313
Ladies and gentlemen,

105
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,185
and invited
Tran gendered species...

106
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,919
in my study of Terran
and Betazoid conjugal rites,

107
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,918
l have discovered
it is traditional

108
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,364
to present the happy couple
with a gift.

109
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,334
Given Commander Riker's
affection

110
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,926
for archaic musical forms,

111
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,962
l have elected to present
the following as my gift

112
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,567
in honor of their conjugation.

113
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,339
Conjugation!

114
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:00,868
Never saw the sun

115
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,904
Shining so bright

116
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,609
Never saw things

117
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,117
Going so right

118
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,382
Noticing the days

119
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,581
Hurrying by

120
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,514
When you're in love

121
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,924
My, how they fly

122
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,588
Oh, blue skies

123
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,291
Smiling at me

124
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,493
lrving Berlin...

125
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:24,731
Nothing but blue skies

126
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,761
Do l see...

127
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,858
lt's tradition, Worf.

128
00:08:52,898 --> 00:08:55,492
You, of all people,
should appreciate that.

129
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:57,559
l will not do it!

130
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,503
Won't do what, Mr. Worf?

131
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:01,506
Captain, l do not think

132
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,633
it is appropriate
for a Starfleet officer

133
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,906
to appear... naked.

134
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,104
Oh, come now.

135
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,273
A big, handsome,
strapping fellow like you?

136
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,612
What can you be afraid of?

137
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,452
Captain, l am picking up

138
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,118
an unusual
electromagnetic signature

139
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,922
from the Kolarun system.

140
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,552
What sort of signature?

141
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,359
Positronic.

142
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:36,737
lt's very faint,
but l've isolated it

143
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,937
to the third planet
in the Kolarun system.

144
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,205
What do we know about it?

145
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,713
Uncharted.

146
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,942
We'll have to get closer
for a more detailed scan.

147
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,381
Theories?

148
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,216
Since positronic signatures
have only been known to emanate

149
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,883
from androids such as myself,
it is logical to theorize

150
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,585
there is an android
on Kolarus lll.

151
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,356
Just what l was afraid of.

152
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,556
Captain? Diverting
to the Kolarus system

153
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:01,430
takes us awfully close
to the Romulan Neutral Zone.

154
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,170
lt's still well on our side.

155
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,537
l think, uh...

156
00:10:09,975 --> 00:10:11,966
l think it's worth
taking a look.

157
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,272
Don't worry, Number One.

158
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,906
We'll still have you to Betazed
with plenty of time to spare.

159
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,108
Thank you, sir.

160
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:21,176
Where we will all honor
the Betazoid tradition.

161
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,847
Now, if you'll excuse me,

162
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,822
l'll be in the gym.

163
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:34,932
Mr. Branson, lay in a course
for the Kolarun system.

164
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,525
Warp five.

165
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,939
What do you think, Data?

166
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,305
A long-lost relative?

167
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:03,855
l'm reading six distinct
positronic signatures spread out

168
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,955
over a few kilometers
on the planet's surface.

169
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:07,658
What do we know
about the population

170
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,894
on Kolarus lll?

171
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,595
lsolated pockets of humanoids.

172
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,831
lt appears to be
a prewarp civilization

173
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,363
at an early stage
of industrial development.

174
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:18,376
Captain, l wouldn't recommend
using the transporter.

175
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,935
That ion storm doesn't
look very neighborly.

176
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,971
lt could head in our direction
without much warning.

177
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,505
Understood.

178
00:11:29,788 --> 00:11:30,880
Data, Mr. Worf.

179
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,390
You're with me.

180
00:11:32,424 --> 00:11:34,984
Captain, l don't have
to remind you...

181
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,324
l appreciate
your concern, Number One.

182
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,957
But, uh, l've been
itching to try the Argo.

183
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,489
l'll bet.

184
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,899
Captain's prerogative.

185
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,994
There's no foreseeable danger.

186
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,095
And your wife would
never forgive me

187
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,004
if anything were
to happen to you.

188
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:50,701
You have the Bridge...

189
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:53,143
Mr. Troi.

190
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:02,747
l will always be puzzled
by the human predilection

191
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:05,306
for piloting vehicles
at unsafe velocities.

192
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,685
Over that rise, sir.

193
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,056
Half a kilometer.

194
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,312
The radiant
electromagnetic field

195
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,114
is interfering
with my tricorder

196
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,621
but we are within a few meters
of the signal.

197
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,385
Fan out.
Let's search around.

198
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,291
lt appears to be a robotic arm.

199
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,069
Very astute.

200
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,371
Mr. Worf, bring it
to the vehicle.

201
00:15:04,636 --> 00:15:06,467
This doesn't feel right.

202
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:16,541
The final signature

203
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,777
is approximately
100 meters to the north, sir.

204
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,478
lt's you.

205
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:55,510
The resemblance is striking.

206
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,924
-Fascinating.
-Fascinating.

207
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:13,935
To the vehicle.

208
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:24,640
l think it's time
to try some unsafe velocities.

209
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:45,766
Why do you have a shiny head?

210
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:49,337
This is not the appropriate time
for a conversation.

211
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:50,272
Why?

212
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,867
Because the Captain
has to concentrate

213
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,968
on piloting the vehicle.

214
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:53,874
Why?

215
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:54,503
-Because...
-Data!

216
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:56,881
Sorry, sir.

217
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:02,420
Have l said something wrong?

218
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,221
Data.

219
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,291
Valve transfer initiated.

220
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,887
You know, all things
considered, Data

221
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,830
l think you have nicer eyes.

222
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:58,026
Our eyes are identical, Doctor.

223
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,740
So what have we got, Geordi?

224
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:04,742
Well, l'd say he has

225
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,471
the same internal mechanics
as Data

226
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:08,103
but not as much
positronic development.

227
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:10,444
The neural pathways
aren't nearly as sophisticated.

228
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,007
l'd say he's a prototype.

229
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,916
Something Dr. Soong
created prior to Data.

230
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:17,751
Do you have a name, sir?

231
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:21,623
l am... B-4.

232
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:26,925
B-4. Dr. Soong's penchant
for whimsical names

233
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,762
seems to have no end.

234
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,291
Can you tell us
how you came to be

235
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,462
on the planet
where we found you?

236
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,302
l do not know.

237
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,831
Do you remember anything
of your life

238
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,935
before you were on the planet?

239
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,137
No.

240
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:44,478
Why does the tall man
have a furry face?

241
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,944
Number One, keep me informed

242
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:51,284
and, uh, Geordi, reassemble him.

243
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,085
Aye, sir.

244
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:59,324
B-4, do you know who l am?

245
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,495
You are me.

246
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,661
No.

247
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:08,662
My name is Data.

248
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,867
l am your brother.

249
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,671
Tea, Earl Grey, hot.

250
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,512
Captain, you have
an alpha priority communication

251
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,989
from Starfleet Command.

252
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:27,889
Acknowledged.

253
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:34,997
Admiral Janeway,
how good to see you again.

254
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,536
Jean-Luc, how'd you like
a trip to Romulus?

255
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,733
With or without
the rest of the fleet?

256
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:42,967
A diplomatic mission.

257
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,169
We've been invited,
believe it or not.

258
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,234
Seems there's been

259
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:49,008
some kind of internal
political shakeup.

260
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:52,208
The new Praetor,
someone called Shinzon

261
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,911
has requested
a Federation envoy.

262
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:54,919
New Praetor?

263
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,614
There's more.

264
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:57,986
He's Reman.

265
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,548
Believe me, we don't
understand it either.

266
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,116
You're the closest ship,

267
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,254
so l want you to go
and hear what he has to say.

268
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,696
Get the lay of the land.

269
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:09,894
lf the Empire becomes unstable,
it could mean trouble

270
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,527
for the entire Quadrant.

271
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,628
Understood.

272
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:13,831
We're sending you

273
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:16,340
all the intelligence
we have, but it's not much.

274
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:19,172
l don't need to tell you
to watch your back, Jean-Luc.

275
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,270
Hardly.

276
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:24,942
The Son'a, the Borg,
the Romulans--

277
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,110
you seem to get
all the easy assignments.

278
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,414
Just lucky, Admiral.

279
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,654
Let's hope that luck holds.

280
00:21:29,654 --> 00:21:30,985
Let's hope that luck holds.

281
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:32,421
Janeway out.

282
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,725
Helmsman, lay in a new course.

283
00:21:40,765 --> 00:21:44,201
Take us to Romulus,
warp eight.

284
00:21:44,235 --> 00:21:45,998
Aye, aye, sir.

285
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,560
Course plotted and laid in.

286
00:21:47,605 --> 00:21:49,004
Romulus?

287
00:21:49,106 --> 00:21:50,903
l'm afraid the Opal Sea
will have to wait, Number One.

288
00:21:50,941 --> 00:21:52,238
Engage.

289
00:22:05,389 --> 00:22:08,620
As you can see, one side
of Remus always faces the sun.

290
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:10,388
Due to the extreme temperatures

291
00:22:10,428 --> 00:22:13,454
on that half of their world,
the Remans live on the dark side

292
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:15,021
of the planet.

293
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:19,302
Almost nothing is known
of the Reman homeworld

294
00:22:19,336 --> 00:22:21,531
although lntelligence scans
have proven the existence

295
00:22:21,572 --> 00:22:25,008
of dilithium mining
and heavy weapons construction.

296
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,777
The Remans themselves are
considered an undesirable caste

297
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:31,406
in the hierarchy of the Empire.

298
00:22:31,449 --> 00:22:32,746
But they also have

299
00:22:32,783 --> 00:22:34,842
a reputation for being
formidable warriors.

300
00:22:34,885 --> 00:22:36,318
ln the Dominion War,

301
00:22:36,353 --> 00:22:38,218
Reman troops were used
as assault forces

302
00:22:38,255 --> 00:22:39,847
in the most violent
encounters.

303
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,187
Cannon fodder.

304
00:22:41,225 --> 00:22:43,785
Yeah, but how did a Reman
get to be Praetor?

305
00:22:43,828 --> 00:22:44,817
l don't get it.

306
00:22:44,862 --> 00:22:47,126
We have to assume he had
Romulan collaborators.

307
00:22:47,164 --> 00:22:48,426
Coup d'etat?

308
00:22:48,466 --> 00:22:50,229
Praetor's power has always been
the Romulan fleet.

309
00:22:50,267 --> 00:22:51,529
They must have been
behind Shinzon

310
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:53,537
for him to have overthrown
the Senate.

311
00:22:53,571 --> 00:22:55,368
What have we learned
about Shinzon?

312
00:22:55,406 --> 00:22:57,670
Starfleet lntelligence
was only able

313
00:22:57,708 --> 00:23:00,472
to provide a partial account
of his military record.

314
00:23:00,511 --> 00:23:01,535
We can infer

315
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:04,309
he is relatively young
and a capable commander.

316
00:23:04,348 --> 00:23:07,545
He fought 12 major engagements
in the war, all successful.

317
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:09,280
Beyond that, we know nothing.

318
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,950
Well, it seems as though we are
truly sailing into the unknown.

319
00:23:14,024 --> 00:23:15,924
Keep at it.

320
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,860
Anything you can give me
will be appreciated.

321
00:23:17,895 --> 00:23:19,829
Dismissed.

322
00:23:19,897 --> 00:23:22,798
l still can't believe
the Captain went along

323
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:25,529
with the memory download.

324
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:28,766
Captain Picard agrees that
the B-4 was probably designed

325
00:23:28,806 --> 00:23:32,367
with the same self-actualization
parameters as myself.

326
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:36,368
lf my memory engrams
are successfully integrated

327
00:23:36,413 --> 00:23:40,611
into his positronic matrix,
he should have all my abilities.

328
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:43,984
Yeah, but he would also have
all of your memories as well.

329
00:23:44,021 --> 00:23:45,750
You feel comfortable with that?

330
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,418
l feel nothing, Geordi.

331
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:51,826
lt is my belief
that with my memory engrams,

332
00:23:51,862 --> 00:23:55,161
he will be able to function
as a more complete individual.

333
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:57,394
An individual more like you,
you mean.

334
00:23:57,434 --> 00:23:59,061
Yes.

335
00:24:02,306 --> 00:24:05,275
Maybe he's not supposed
to be like you, Data.

336
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:09,075
Maybe he's supposed
to be exactly the way he is.

337
00:24:09,113 --> 00:24:11,581
That might be so,

338
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:13,583
but l believe he should have
the opportunity

339
00:24:13,617 --> 00:24:15,346
to explore his potential.

340
00:24:16,387 --> 00:24:17,649
Hmm.

341
00:24:18,656 --> 00:24:21,716
Okay, we're done.

342
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:32,133
B-4, do you know where you are?

343
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:35,696
l am in a room with lights.

344
00:24:38,943 --> 00:24:41,173
Can you remember our father?

345
00:24:42,546 --> 00:24:44,173
Our father?

346
00:24:44,215 --> 00:24:45,705
Yes, Dr. Soong.

347
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:48,182
No.

348
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,483
Do you know the name
of the Captain of this vessel?

349
00:24:52,523 --> 00:24:54,081
Captain...

350
00:24:54,124 --> 00:24:55,523
No.

351
00:24:57,995 --> 00:25:01,431
Data, he's assimilating
a lot of programming.

352
00:25:01,465 --> 00:25:03,399
Remember, he's a prototype,

353
00:25:03,434 --> 00:25:05,334
a lot less sophisticated
than you are.

354
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:08,497
We just don't know if his matrix
will be able to adapt.

355
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:11,030
We really need
to give him some time.

356
00:25:11,075 --> 00:25:14,567
Geordi, what purpose
does this serve?

357
00:25:14,612 --> 00:25:15,579
What?

358
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:16,671
This.

359
00:25:17,681 --> 00:25:19,649
That's a redundant memory port.

360
00:25:19,683 --> 00:25:21,708
Maybe the provisional
memory storage

361
00:25:21,752 --> 00:25:24,084
is in case his neural
pathways overload.

362
00:25:24,121 --> 00:25:26,954
Do you mind if l keep
him here for a while

363
00:25:26,991 --> 00:25:28,424
run a few diagnostics?

364
00:25:28,459 --> 00:25:30,654
No, l do not mind.

365
00:25:30,694 --> 00:25:32,252
Data.

366
00:25:33,264 --> 00:25:34,231
No.

367
00:25:34,265 --> 00:25:35,664
You must remain
with Commander La Forge.

368
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:38,259
He is going
to try to help you.

369
00:25:47,945 --> 00:25:52,109
Captain's Log, Stardate 56844.9.

370
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:54,617
The Enterprise
has arrived at Romulus

371
00:25:54,652 --> 00:25:57,780
and is waiting
at the designated coordinates.

372
00:25:57,821 --> 00:26:00,756
All our hails
have gone unanswered.

373
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:04,283
We've been waiting for 1 7 hours.

374
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:10,933
Counselor?

375
00:26:10,968 --> 00:26:13,596
They're out there, sir.

376
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:33,617
Captain, l recommend
we raise shields.

377
00:26:33,657 --> 00:26:34,817
Not yet, Mr. Worf.

378
00:26:34,858 --> 00:26:38,555
Captain, with all due respect
to diplomatic protocol,

379
00:26:38,595 --> 00:26:41,462
the Federation Council
isn't sitting out here;

380
00:26:41,498 --> 00:26:42,465
we are.

381
00:26:42,499 --> 00:26:43,466
Patience.

382
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,900
Diplomacy is
a very exacting occupation.

383
00:26:45,936 --> 00:26:47,961
We will wait.

384
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:49,665
Captain...

385
00:26:55,913 --> 00:26:56,641
Raising shields.

386
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,704
-No!
-Captain...

387
00:26:57,748 --> 00:26:59,875
Tactical analysis, Mr. Worf.

388
00:27:02,286 --> 00:27:06,916
52 disruptor banks,
27 photon torpedo bays

389
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:08,458
primary and secondary
shields.

390
00:27:12,162 --> 00:27:14,221
She's a predator.

391
00:27:26,076 --> 00:27:27,065
We are being hailed.

392
00:27:28,645 --> 00:27:29,976
On screen.

393
00:27:35,753 --> 00:27:41,851
Enterprise, we are
the Reman Warbird Scimitar.

394
00:27:41,892 --> 00:27:44,884
Praetor Shinzon, l'm pleased...

395
00:27:44,928 --> 00:27:46,987
l am not Shinzon.

396
00:27:47,998 --> 00:27:50,432
l am his Viceroy.

397
00:27:50,467 --> 00:27:54,426
We are sending
transport coordinates.

398
00:27:57,674 --> 00:27:59,574
Not very chatty.

399
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,976
Away team to Transporter Room 4.

400
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:51,659
l hope you'll forgive
the darkness.

401
00:28:53,397 --> 00:28:55,388
We are not comfortable
in the light.

402
00:28:57,501 --> 00:28:58,866
Praetor Shinzon?

403
00:28:58,902 --> 00:29:02,497
Captain Picard.

404
00:29:04,374 --> 00:29:06,808
Jean-Luc Picard.

405
00:29:08,612 --> 00:29:11,877
l'd always imagined you
a little taller.

406
00:29:11,915 --> 00:29:13,075
lsn't that odd?

407
00:29:15,852 --> 00:29:20,880
You may scan me without
subterfuge, Commander Data.

408
00:29:30,934 --> 00:29:33,767
You are not as we imagined you.

409
00:29:33,804 --> 00:29:36,034
No?

410
00:29:36,073 --> 00:29:37,165
You are human.

411
00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:44,973
Why have you asked
us to come here?

412
00:29:46,717 --> 00:29:49,208
Praetor?

413
00:29:49,252 --> 00:29:52,551
l've never met
a human woman before.

414
00:29:52,589 --> 00:29:54,352
l'm only half human.

415
00:29:54,391 --> 00:29:55,415
Deanna Troi...

416
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:57,893
of Betazed.

417
00:29:57,928 --> 00:30:03,127
Empathic and telepathic
abilities, Ship's Counselor--

418
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:06,932
all this l knew, but l
never knew you were so...

419
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:07,959
beautiful.

420
00:30:08,005 --> 00:30:10,565
You seem quite familiar
with our personnel.

421
00:30:10,607 --> 00:30:12,598
Oh, l am, Commander Riker.

422
00:30:14,311 --> 00:30:16,302
May l touch your hair?

423
00:30:16,346 --> 00:30:17,608
We came to Romulus

424
00:30:17,648 --> 00:30:20,549
on a matter we were assured
was of great importance.

425
00:30:20,584 --> 00:30:23,985
lf you have anything
to say to us as representatives

426
00:30:24,054 --> 00:30:25,954
of the Federation,
l suggest you do it now.

427
00:30:25,989 --> 00:30:30,790
Yes.
l'm sorry, Captain.

428
00:30:30,827 --> 00:30:32,761
There is so much
we need to talk about.

429
00:30:32,796 --> 00:30:35,890
l would be interested to know
what we are talking about.

430
00:30:35,932 --> 00:30:38,526
Unity, Captain.

431
00:30:38,568 --> 00:30:40,001
Tearing down the walls

432
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:44,336
between us,
to recognize that we are one.

433
00:30:45,842 --> 00:30:49,505
l'm talking of the thing
that makes us the same--

434
00:30:49,546 --> 00:30:51,411
peace.

435
00:30:51,448 --> 00:30:53,746
We want peace.

436
00:30:57,854 --> 00:30:59,754
Right now, you're thinking,

437
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,883
''This all sounds
too good to be true.''

438
00:31:01,925 --> 00:31:03,415
But you're also thinking

439
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,590
that the chance for peace
is too promising to ignore.

440
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:11,965
Am l right?

441
00:31:14,304 --> 00:31:15,771
Yes.

442
00:31:15,806 --> 00:31:19,105
Then perhaps it's time
to add some illumination

443
00:31:19,142 --> 00:31:20,439
to our discussion.

444
00:31:20,477 --> 00:31:24,106
Computer, raise the lighting
four levels.

445
00:31:37,427 --> 00:31:39,327
When l was very young,

446
00:31:39,362 --> 00:31:42,354
l was stricken
with an odd disease.

447
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:47,359
l developed
a hypersensitivity to sound.

448
00:31:47,404 --> 00:31:49,998
Even the slightest whisper
caused me agony.

449
00:31:50,073 --> 00:31:52,701
No one could do
anything about it.

450
00:31:52,743 --> 00:31:55,303
Finally, l was taken to a doctor

451
00:31:55,345 --> 00:31:57,609
who had some experience
of Terran illnesses

452
00:31:57,647 --> 00:31:59,808
and he diagnosed me
with Shalaft's syndrome.

453
00:32:01,852 --> 00:32:04,150
Do you know of it, Captain?

454
00:32:09,493 --> 00:32:11,757
Yes.

455
00:32:11,795 --> 00:32:16,129
Then you know
it's a very rare syndrome.

456
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:17,428
Genetic.

457
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:21,335
Apparently, all the male members
of a family have it.

458
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,365
Eventually, l was treated,

459
00:32:25,408 --> 00:32:28,969
and now l can hear
as well as you can, Captain.

460
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:32,708
l can see as well as you can.

461
00:32:32,749 --> 00:32:34,341
l can feel...

462
00:32:34,384 --> 00:32:38,514
everything you feel.

463
00:32:38,555 --> 00:32:44,460
ln fact, l feel exactly
what you feel...

464
00:32:44,494 --> 00:32:46,462
don't l, Jean-Luc?

465
00:32:49,266 --> 00:32:50,460
Come to dinner--

466
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,867
tomorrow on Romulus,
just the two of us.

467
00:32:53,904 --> 00:32:55,462
Or should l say...

468
00:32:55,505 --> 00:32:59,032
just the one of us?

469
00:33:12,455 --> 00:33:15,117
l think you'll be wanting this.

470
00:33:19,296 --> 00:33:21,423
Till tomorrow then, Captain.

471
00:33:21,464 --> 00:33:23,625
We have much to discuss.

472
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:31,671
Computer, return lighting
to previous level.

473
00:34:01,238 --> 00:34:03,468
There's no doubt, Captain--

474
00:34:03,506 --> 00:34:06,942
right down to your aggressive
strain of Shalaft's syndrome.

475
00:34:07,043 --> 00:34:08,510
He's a clone.

476
00:34:08,545 --> 00:34:12,709
They probably used a hair
follicle or a skin cell.

477
00:34:12,749 --> 00:34:14,614
Why?

478
00:34:14,651 --> 00:34:17,279
l intend to find out,
Number One.

479
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,687
lnform Starfleet
of the situation.

480
00:34:20,724 --> 00:34:23,716
l need to know
where the hell he came from.

481
00:34:25,462 --> 00:34:26,622
Counselor.

482
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:31,860
We supported you, Shinzon,

483
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:34,063
when you assassinated
the Senate.

484
00:34:34,104 --> 00:34:36,334
You told us
the timing was perfect

485
00:34:36,373 --> 00:34:38,500
for an attack
on the Federation.

486
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:41,669
l don't understand
why now, you delay.

487
00:34:41,711 --> 00:34:44,179
You don't have to understand.

488
00:34:44,214 --> 00:34:45,909
And bringing
the Enterprise here--

489
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,974
What possible purpose
could that serve?

490
00:34:48,018 --> 00:34:49,212
l have a purpose.

491
00:34:49,252 --> 00:34:50,947
Then perhaps
you'll enlighten us.

492
00:34:50,987 --> 00:34:52,477
Silence from you!

493
00:35:00,063 --> 00:35:04,466
You really must learn patience,
Commander.

494
00:35:04,501 --> 00:35:08,494
Spend 18 hours every day
under the lash

495
00:35:08,538 --> 00:35:12,668
of a Romulan guard, and you'll
soon understand patience.

496
00:35:14,177 --> 00:35:16,168
Now go.

497
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:27,519
Commander Donatra.

498
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:30,992
Please, remain.

499
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:41,200
There's a word

500
00:35:41,237 --> 00:35:45,697
l want you to consider:
allegiance.

501
00:35:45,742 --> 00:35:49,007
lt's something l demand
from those who serve me.

502
00:35:49,112 --> 00:35:50,647
Do l serve you?

503
00:35:51,848 --> 00:35:52,837
Yes.

504
00:35:52,882 --> 00:35:54,975
And l think, faithfully.

505
00:35:55,051 --> 00:35:58,543
Commander Suran,
on the other hand...

506
00:35:58,588 --> 00:36:00,055
gives me pause.

507
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:05,049
Here's another word, Praetor:

508
00:36:05,094 --> 00:36:07,892
trust.

509
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,432
Do you trust me?

510
00:36:12,468 --> 00:36:15,699
How far does that trust extend?

511
00:36:15,738 --> 00:36:17,035
How...

512
00:36:17,073 --> 00:36:19,906
deep does it go?

513
00:36:21,577 --> 00:36:23,340
What must a Commander do

514
00:36:23,379 --> 00:36:25,779
to prove herself
faithful to you?

515
00:36:25,815 --> 00:36:28,750
What must a woman do?

516
00:36:30,586 --> 00:36:34,454
You... are not a woman.

517
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:37,118
You are a Romulan.

518
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:42,325
Serve me faithfully,
and you will be rewarded.

519
00:36:42,365 --> 00:36:47,325
Keep those lovely eyes
on Commander Suran.

520
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:52,603
And at the first sign
of treachery...

521
00:36:55,511 --> 00:36:58,446
Dispose of him.

522
00:36:58,481 --> 00:37:02,542
Then you will have
proven yourself.

523
00:37:09,058 --> 00:37:10,787
Now go.

524
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:21,593
And, Commander...

525
00:37:25,241 --> 00:37:30,372
if you ever touch me again...

526
00:37:30,413 --> 00:37:32,677
l'll kill you.

527
00:38:45,388 --> 00:38:48,551
The Romulans had somehow
gained possession of your DNA

528
00:38:48,591 --> 00:38:50,616
and l had been created.

529
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,718
And when l was ready,

530
00:38:51,761 --> 00:38:56,323
they were going
to replace you with me...

531
00:38:56,365 --> 00:38:59,528
put a Romulan agent
at the heart of Starfleet.

532
00:38:59,569 --> 00:39:01,594
lt was a bold plan.

533
00:39:01,637 --> 00:39:03,036
What happened?

534
00:39:03,072 --> 00:39:05,905
As happens frequently
here on Romulus...

535
00:39:05,942 --> 00:39:08,911
a new government came to power.

536
00:39:09,011 --> 00:39:10,842
They decided
to abandon the plan.

537
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,507
They were afraid that l

538
00:39:12,548 --> 00:39:14,880
might be discovered,
that it would lead to war.

539
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:22,723
Not quite the face you remember.

540
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,657
Not quite.

541
00:39:25,695 --> 00:39:30,155
A lifetime of violence
will do that.

542
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:31,598
They broke my nose

543
00:39:31,634 --> 00:39:33,397
my jaw...

544
00:39:33,436 --> 00:39:36,428
but so much is the same.

545
00:39:36,472 --> 00:39:38,770
The eyes...

546
00:39:38,808 --> 00:39:40,275
Surely you recognize the eyes.

547
00:39:40,309 --> 00:39:42,436
Yes.

548
00:39:42,478 --> 00:39:46,676
Our eyes reflect our lives,
don't they?

549
00:39:46,716 --> 00:39:49,048
And yours are so confident.

550
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,122
So l'm not as tall
as you expected.

551
00:39:57,159 --> 00:40:00,856
Well, l had always hoped
l might hit two meters.

552
00:40:00,897 --> 00:40:04,560
As had l.

553
00:40:07,169 --> 00:40:09,194
How did you end up on Remus?

554
00:40:11,674 --> 00:40:13,539
They sent me there to die.

555
00:40:15,378 --> 00:40:20,213
How could a mere human
survive the dilithium mines?

556
00:40:20,249 --> 00:40:22,740
Not that it mattered,
as l was no longer

557
00:40:22,785 --> 00:40:25,515
part of their plans
against the Federation.

558
00:40:27,323 --> 00:40:31,384
ln those terrible depths
lived only the damned.

559
00:40:31,427 --> 00:40:33,987
Together with the Reman slaves,
l was condemned

560
00:40:34,063 --> 00:40:36,930
to an existence of unceasing
labor and starvation

561
00:40:36,966 --> 00:40:40,129
under the brutal heel
of the Romulan guards.

562
00:40:40,169 --> 00:40:43,229
Only the very strongest
had any hope of survival.

563
00:40:43,272 --> 00:40:46,708
l was only a child
when they took me.

564
00:40:46,742 --> 00:40:49,575
Then l didn't see the sun
or the stars again

565
00:40:49,612 --> 00:40:51,011
for nearly ten years.

566
00:40:52,882 --> 00:40:55,612
The only thing
the Romulan guards

567
00:40:55,651 --> 00:40:57,881
hated more than the Remans

568
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,320
was me.

569
00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:07,955
But one man took pity on me.

570
00:41:08,064 --> 00:41:12,558
The man that became my Viceroy.

571
00:41:12,601 --> 00:41:15,968
He protected me
from the cruelty of the guards

572
00:41:16,038 --> 00:41:19,530
and taught me how to survive.

573
00:41:19,575 --> 00:41:24,842
And in that dark place where
there was nothing of myself

574
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,180
l found my Reman brothers.

575
00:41:29,218 --> 00:41:33,382
They showed me the only true
kindness l have ever known.

576
00:41:33,422 --> 00:41:36,220
You're doing this
to liberate the Remans?

577
00:41:36,258 --> 00:41:41,286
That is the single thought
behind everything l have done--

578
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:42,957
from building the Scimitar
at a secret base

579
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:43,966
to assembling my army

580
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,197
finally coming to Romulus
in force.

581
00:41:47,236 --> 00:41:49,261
l knew they would never
give us our freedom.

582
00:41:49,305 --> 00:41:50,465
l would have to take it.

583
00:41:50,506 --> 00:41:54,533
And how many Romulans died
for your freedom?

584
00:41:56,045 --> 00:41:57,535
Too many.

585
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,548
But the point is, that finally

586
00:41:59,582 --> 00:42:02,881
the Empire is realizing
that there is a better way.

587
00:42:02,918 --> 00:42:05,853
And that way is peace.

588
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:11,724
You don't trust me.

589
00:42:11,761 --> 00:42:14,696
l have no reason to.

590
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:16,823
You have every reason.

591
00:42:16,866 --> 00:42:19,391
lf you had lived my life

592
00:42:19,435 --> 00:42:22,927
and experienced
the suffering of my people

593
00:42:22,972 --> 00:42:25,566
you would be standing
where l am.

594
00:42:25,608 --> 00:42:27,735
And if you had lived my life,
you would understand

595
00:42:27,777 --> 00:42:29,301
my responsibility
to the Federation.

596
00:42:29,345 --> 00:42:31,779
l cannot allow
my personal feelings

597
00:42:31,814 --> 00:42:33,873
to unduly influence
my decisions.

598
00:42:33,916 --> 00:42:37,408
All l have are
my personal feelings.

599
00:42:42,658 --> 00:42:46,116
l want to know
what it means to be human.

600
00:42:46,162 --> 00:42:47,891
The Remans have given me

601
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:51,957
a future, but you can tell me
about my past.

602
00:42:52,001 --> 00:42:55,300
l can tell you about my past.

603
00:42:57,406 --> 00:42:59,465
Were we Picards always warriors?

604
00:42:59,508 --> 00:43:02,245
l think of myself
as an explorer.

605
00:43:02,411 --> 00:43:04,436
Well, were we always explorers?

606
00:43:06,515 --> 00:43:09,416
l was the first Picard
to leave our solar system.

607
00:43:09,452 --> 00:43:12,853
lt caused quite a stir
in the family.

608
00:43:12,888 --> 00:43:16,415
But...

609
00:43:16,459 --> 00:43:18,927
l'd spent my youth...

610
00:43:18,961 --> 00:43:21,759
Looking up at the stars dreaming
about what was up there.

611
00:43:21,797 --> 00:43:22,923
About...

612
00:43:22,965 --> 00:43:24,626
New worlds.

613
00:43:38,848 --> 00:43:40,941
l'm trying to believe you,
Shinzon.

614
00:43:45,688 --> 00:43:47,087
lf there is one ideal

615
00:43:47,123 --> 00:43:49,455
that the Federation
holds most dear

616
00:43:49,492 --> 00:43:55,260
it is that all men...
all races can be united.

617
00:43:58,134 --> 00:44:02,935
What better example
than a Starfleet captain

618
00:44:02,972 --> 00:44:05,372
standing in the Romulan Senate.

619
00:44:08,077 --> 00:44:11,672
Nothing would make me more proud

620
00:44:11,714 --> 00:44:15,081
than to take your hand
in friendship...

621
00:44:15,117 --> 00:44:20,714
in time... when that trust
has been earned.

622
00:44:26,028 --> 00:44:28,326
Captain, we have had
an unauthorized access

623
00:44:28,364 --> 00:44:29,353
into the main computer.

624
00:44:29,398 --> 00:44:30,592
Source?

625
00:44:30,633 --> 00:44:33,329
lt's going to take some time
to figure that out, Captain.

626
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:34,734
The data stream was rerouted

627
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:36,567
through substations
all over the ship.

628
00:44:36,605 --> 00:44:37,731
What programs were accessed?

629
00:44:37,773 --> 00:44:38,740
Well...

630
00:44:38,774 --> 00:44:40,639
that's what l can't figure out.

631
00:44:40,676 --> 00:44:43,144
lt's mostly just
basic stellar cartography.

632
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:46,410
Star charts, communications
protocols, some uplinks

633
00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:47,541
from colony tracking stations.

634
00:44:47,583 --> 00:44:48,845
lt's not even
restricted material.

635
00:44:48,884 --> 00:44:50,749
Nevertheless,
we must learn the source.

636
00:44:50,786 --> 00:44:51,810
Keep me informed.

637
00:44:51,854 --> 00:44:54,084
Captain, there's something else.

638
00:44:54,123 --> 00:44:57,092
l was reviewing the sensor logs.

639
00:44:57,126 --> 00:44:58,115
Look at this.

640
00:44:59,495 --> 00:45:00,928
When the Scimitar de-cloaked

641
00:45:00,996 --> 00:45:03,692
there was a momentary spike
in the tertiary EM band.

642
00:45:03,733 --> 00:45:04,722
There.

643
00:45:04,767 --> 00:45:06,462
You're not going
to believe this.

644
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:09,461
lt's thalaron.

645
00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:15,539
l thought thalaron radiation
was theoretical.

646
00:45:15,578 --> 00:45:18,445
Which is why our initial
scans didn't pick it up,

647
00:45:18,481 --> 00:45:19,914
but he's got it, Captain.

648
00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:21,940
Thalaron research
was banned in the Federation

649
00:45:21,984 --> 00:45:23,952
because of its biogenic
properties.

650
00:45:24,053 --> 00:45:26,817
lt has the ability
to consume organic material

651
00:45:26,856 --> 00:45:28,050
at the subatomic level.

652
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:31,651
l can't overestimate the danger
of thalaron radiation, Jean-Luc.

653
00:45:31,694 --> 00:45:33,628
A microscopic amount

654
00:45:33,662 --> 00:45:35,653
could kill every
living thing on this ship

655
00:45:35,698 --> 00:45:37,427
in a matter of seconds.

656
00:45:37,466 --> 00:45:38,899
l understand.
Keep on it.

657
00:45:38,934 --> 00:45:41,767
l want to know what he has
and how we can neutralize

658
00:45:41,804 --> 00:45:43,431
any threat.

659
00:45:43,472 --> 00:45:45,201
l need options.

660
00:45:57,186 --> 00:45:59,313
This was a mistake.

661
00:45:59,355 --> 00:46:00,652
We're wasting time.

662
00:46:01,891 --> 00:46:04,359
My time.

663
00:46:04,393 --> 00:46:07,590
And l shall spend it
how l choose.

664
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:10,292
Do not forget our mission,
Shinzon.

665
00:46:10,332 --> 00:46:13,165
We must act now.

666
00:46:19,308 --> 00:46:21,868
We'll return to the Scimitar.

667
00:46:23,646 --> 00:46:26,672
l was merely curious about him.

668
00:46:40,863 --> 00:46:42,125
Come.

669
00:46:43,832 --> 00:46:46,733
Beverly, come in.

670
00:46:50,005 --> 00:46:52,030
Remember him?

671
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:57,843
He was a bit cocky as l recall.

672
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,575
He was a damned fool.

673
00:46:59,615 --> 00:47:01,845
Selfish, ambitious

674
00:47:01,884 --> 00:47:04,045
very much in need of seasoning.

675
00:47:04,086 --> 00:47:06,281
He turned out all right.

676
00:47:09,525 --> 00:47:12,688
l really wanted
to believe Shinzon.

677
00:47:12,728 --> 00:47:18,223
But this thalaron radiation
just can't be explained away.

678
00:47:20,736 --> 00:47:23,068
Whatever he's after,

679
00:47:23,105 --> 00:47:24,868
it isn't peace.

680
00:47:24,974 --> 00:47:28,239
ls he very much
the way you were?

681
00:47:30,779 --> 00:47:32,576
Oh, yes.

682
00:47:32,615 --> 00:47:35,083
Data to Captain Picard.

683
00:47:35,117 --> 00:47:36,311
Go ahead, Data.

684
00:47:36,352 --> 00:47:39,549
Captain, Geordi and l
have identified the source

685
00:47:39,588 --> 00:47:41,283
of the unauthorized
computer access

686
00:47:41,323 --> 00:47:42,688
and l believe we have found

687
00:47:42,725 --> 00:47:45,193
a way to gain
a tactical advantage.

688
00:47:45,227 --> 00:47:46,592
On my way.

689
00:47:59,408 --> 00:48:02,172
Will...

690
00:48:02,211 --> 00:48:06,580
as Ship's Counselor,
l recommend you get some sleep.

691
00:48:08,417 --> 00:48:10,044
Some honeymoon.

692
00:48:14,523 --> 00:48:16,514
Come to bed.

693
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,152
Imzadi.

694
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,111
Imzadi.

695
00:48:46,555 --> 00:48:47,544
No.

696
00:48:47,589 --> 00:48:49,819
He can never know you as l can.

697
00:48:49,858 --> 00:48:53,589
He can never touch you
as l can.

698
00:48:53,629 --> 00:48:54,527
This isn't real.

699
00:48:54,563 --> 00:48:56,326
Feel my lips.

700
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,335
l'm with you, Imzadi.

701
00:49:07,476 --> 00:49:09,740
l'll always be with you now.

702
00:49:09,778 --> 00:49:10,403
No!

703
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,838
-This isn't real.
-Deanna...

704
00:49:12,948 --> 00:49:13,846
what's the matter?

705
00:49:13,949 --> 00:49:14,938
-No.
-Deanna.

706
00:49:14,983 --> 00:49:16,416
Deanna.

707
00:49:16,452 --> 00:49:16,941
Deanna!

708
00:49:16,985 --> 00:49:18,247
No!

709
00:49:22,157 --> 00:49:24,318
The bond has been broken.

710
00:49:27,096 --> 00:49:29,462
Find her again.

711
00:49:32,935 --> 00:49:36,427
Praetor, we've received
the transponder signal.

712
00:49:47,783 --> 00:49:49,114
lt's accelerating.

713
00:49:49,151 --> 00:49:51,585
You have no more time for games.

714
00:49:56,191 --> 00:49:59,820
Have the doctors prepare.

715
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,402
Transport.

716
00:50:22,384 --> 00:50:24,978
Begin the download.

717
00:50:42,337 --> 00:50:43,929
Tea.

718
00:50:43,972 --> 00:50:45,166
Hot.

719
00:50:59,854 --> 00:51:02,982
Aside from slightly
elevated levels of adrenaline

720
00:51:03,024 --> 00:51:04,582
and serotonin,
you're perfectly normal.

721
00:51:09,831 --> 00:51:10,991
Deanna...

722
00:51:11,032 --> 00:51:13,159
can you describe it?

723
00:51:13,201 --> 00:51:14,532
lt was a...

724
00:51:17,605 --> 00:51:18,799
lt was a violation.

725
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:22,833
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have

726
00:51:22,877 --> 00:51:24,504
the ability to reach
into my thoughts.

727
00:51:24,546 --> 00:51:26,741
l've become a liability.

728
00:51:26,781 --> 00:51:29,147
l request to be
relieved of my duties.

729
00:51:29,184 --> 00:51:30,378
Permission denied.

730
00:51:31,953 --> 00:51:34,717
lf you can endure
more of these assaults,

731
00:51:34,756 --> 00:51:37,224
l need you at my side,
now more than ever.

732
00:51:37,258 --> 00:51:40,227
The Enterprise is far
from Federation space and...

733
00:51:43,365 --> 00:51:44,889
Worf! Shields up!

734
00:51:55,276 --> 00:51:57,642
Hello, Jean-Luc.

735
00:51:59,447 --> 00:52:00,744
Why am l here?

736
00:52:00,782 --> 00:52:02,215
Why have you done this?

737
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:03,911
l was lonely.

738
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:17,057
What are you going to do?

739
00:52:17,098 --> 00:52:19,123
l need a sample of your blood.

740
00:52:20,168 --> 00:52:24,298
What is it
your Borg friends say?

741
00:52:24,339 --> 00:52:25,601
''Resistance is futile.''

742
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:35,110
Oh, yes-- the android.

743
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:37,380
The bait you couldn't refuse.

744
00:52:37,419 --> 00:52:41,412
All of this
so you could capture me.

745
00:52:41,456 --> 00:52:43,822
Don't be so vain.

746
00:52:45,493 --> 00:52:46,858
After we found it,

747
00:52:46,895 --> 00:52:49,523
we had to make
a few modifications.

748
00:52:49,564 --> 00:52:52,863
An extra memory port,
a hidden transponder.

749
00:52:52,901 --> 00:52:55,461
l've now gained access
to Starfleet's

750
00:52:55,503 --> 00:52:58,028
communications protocol.

751
00:52:58,072 --> 00:53:01,974
l now know the exact location
of your entire fleet.

752
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:03,739
You may go.

753
00:53:03,778 --> 00:53:07,145
Where?

754
00:53:07,182 --> 00:53:09,673
Out of my sight.

755
00:53:13,788 --> 00:53:16,222
What is all this about?

756
00:53:16,257 --> 00:53:19,055
lt's about destiny, Picard.

757
00:53:19,093 --> 00:53:22,460
lt's about a Reman outcast.

758
00:53:22,497 --> 00:53:23,828
You're not Reman.

759
00:53:23,865 --> 00:53:26,231
And l'm not quite human.

760
00:53:26,267 --> 00:53:28,394
So what am l?

761
00:53:28,846 --> 00:53:33,249
My life is meaningless
as long as you're still alive.

762
00:53:34,785 --> 00:53:38,516
What am l while you exist?

763
00:53:38,556 --> 00:53:39,989
A shadow?

764
00:53:40,024 --> 00:53:41,423
An echo?

765
00:53:41,459 --> 00:53:44,087
lf your issues are with me,
then deal with me.

766
00:53:44,128 --> 00:53:46,221
This has nothing to do
with my ship--

767
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:48,232
nothing to do
with the Federation.

768
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:49,528
Oh, but it does.

769
00:53:49,567 --> 00:53:53,526
We will no longer bow
before anyone as slaves

770
00:53:53,571 --> 00:53:57,268
not the Romulans
and not your mighty Federation.

771
00:53:57,308 --> 00:54:02,075
We are a race bred for war

772
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:04,445
and conquest.

773
00:54:04,482 --> 00:54:07,974
Are you ready to plunge
the entire Quadrant into war

774
00:54:08,019 --> 00:54:10,453
to satisfy
your own personal demons?

775
00:54:10,488 --> 00:54:13,286
lt amazes me
how little you know yourself.

776
00:54:13,324 --> 00:54:15,588
l'm incapable of such an act!

777
00:54:15,626 --> 00:54:17,787
You are me.

778
00:54:20,665 --> 00:54:27,332
The same noble Picard blood
runs through our veins.

779
00:54:28,673 --> 00:54:30,800
Had you lived my life,
you'd be doing exactly as l am.

780
00:54:34,178 --> 00:54:36,646
So look in the mirror.

781
00:54:36,681 --> 00:54:38,171
See yourself.

782
00:54:40,685 --> 00:54:43,882
Consider that, Captain.

783
00:54:43,921 --> 00:54:47,254
l can think of no greater
torment for you.

784
00:54:53,698 --> 00:54:56,462
Shinzon.

785
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,765
l'm a mirror for you as well.

786
00:55:02,974 --> 00:55:05,465
Not for long, Captain.

787
00:55:05,509 --> 00:55:09,502
l'm afraid you won't survive
to witness the victory

788
00:55:09,547 --> 00:55:11,742
of the echo over the voice.

789
00:55:27,932 --> 00:55:29,661
His cloak is perfect.

790
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:33,067
No tachyon emissions,
no residual antiprotons.

791
00:55:33,104 --> 00:55:35,299
Keep at it, Geordi.

792
00:55:35,339 --> 00:55:36,863
Find a way in.

793
00:55:46,784 --> 00:55:49,947
Praetor Shinzon
needs the prisoner.

794
00:56:00,831 --> 00:56:02,389
About time, Mr. Data.

795
00:56:02,433 --> 00:56:03,832
My mission was a success, sir.

796
00:56:05,636 --> 00:56:08,264
l have located the source
of the radiation.

797
00:56:08,305 --> 00:56:11,797
This entire ship is essentially
a thalaron generator.

798
00:56:11,842 --> 00:56:13,036
lts power relays lead

799
00:56:13,077 --> 00:56:15,238
to an activation matrix
on the Bridge.

800
00:56:15,279 --> 00:56:16,268
lt's a weapon.

801
00:56:16,313 --> 00:56:17,280
lt would appear so.

802
00:56:17,314 --> 00:56:18,542
What about the download?

803
00:56:18,582 --> 00:56:20,846
Shinzon believes he has
our communication protocols

804
00:56:20,885 --> 00:56:22,819
but they will give him
inaccurate locations

805
00:56:22,853 --> 00:56:24,081
for all Starfleet vessels.

806
00:56:24,121 --> 00:56:25,782
Good work.

807
00:56:25,823 --> 00:56:26,949
Sir.

808
00:56:29,126 --> 00:56:30,286
Geordi supplied me

809
00:56:30,394 --> 00:56:32,988
with a prototype
of the emergency transport unit.

810
00:56:35,332 --> 00:56:38,130
l recommend you use this, sir,
to return to the Enterprise.

811
00:56:38,169 --> 00:56:40,763
lt will only work for one of us.

812
00:56:40,805 --> 00:56:43,000
Yes, sir.

813
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,313
We'll find a way off together.

814
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:08,098
lt is time for the procedure.

815
00:57:22,779 --> 00:57:24,770
Move, puny human animal.

816
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:29,308
A bit less florid, Data.

817
00:57:59,816 --> 00:58:01,283
Kill him.

818
00:58:13,696 --> 00:58:15,254
This way, sir.

819
00:58:15,298 --> 00:58:18,290
There is a shuttlebay 94 meters
from our current position.

820
00:58:36,386 --> 00:58:37,819
There it is, sir.

821
00:58:37,854 --> 00:58:38,843
Go!

822
00:59:07,951 --> 00:59:09,248
Data!

823
00:59:09,319 --> 00:59:12,220
lt appears to have
an encrypted security system.

824
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:15,782
Alacrity will be
appreciated, Commander!

825
00:59:15,825 --> 00:59:18,953
Reman is a most complex
language, with pictographs

826
00:59:18,995 --> 00:59:20,462
representing
certain verb roots...

827
00:59:20,496 --> 00:59:22,157
While l find that fascinating,

828
00:59:22,198 --> 00:59:24,462
Data, we really need
that door open!

829
01:00:02,538 --> 01:00:04,836
According to the ship's manifest

830
01:00:04,874 --> 01:00:07,001
they are Scorpion-class
attack flyers.

831
01:00:24,193 --> 01:00:26,957
Data, what do you imagine
this is?

832
01:00:26,996 --> 01:00:28,327
Port thruster, sir.

833
01:00:28,398 --> 01:00:30,025
Would you like me to drive, sir?

834
01:00:43,646 --> 01:00:46,080
Data, can you open
the shuttlebay doors?

835
01:00:46,115 --> 01:00:47,480
Negative, sir.

836
01:00:47,517 --> 01:00:49,280
They have erected
a force field around

837
01:00:49,319 --> 01:00:50,286
the external portals.

838
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,720
Well, then, only one way to go.

839
01:01:02,832 --> 01:01:05,300
Do you think this is
a wise course of action, sir?

840
01:01:05,335 --> 01:01:07,530
We're about to find out, Data.

841
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:09,731
Power up the disruptors.

842
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:11,864
Ready, Captain.

843
01:01:11,908 --> 01:01:12,840
Fire.

844
01:01:52,382 --> 01:01:54,577
Tractor beam, now!

845
01:01:56,552 --> 01:01:59,350
Worf, lock on transporters.

846
01:02:06,262 --> 01:02:08,355
l have them, sir.

847
01:02:18,074 --> 01:02:20,542
This has gone far enough.

848
01:02:20,576 --> 01:02:23,875
l thought we
discussed patience, Commander.

849
01:02:23,913 --> 01:02:25,574
Mine is wearing thin.

850
01:02:25,615 --> 01:02:28,641
We supported you
because you promised action,

851
01:02:28,684 --> 01:02:30,311
and yet, you delay.

852
01:02:32,789 --> 01:02:34,848
The Enterprise is immaterial.

853
01:02:34,891 --> 01:02:39,157
lt won't even make it
out of the Neutral Zone.

854
01:02:39,195 --> 01:02:40,753
And in two days,

855
01:02:40,797 --> 01:02:45,632
the Federation will be crippled
beyond repair.

856
01:02:45,668 --> 01:02:48,068
Does that satisfy you?

857
01:02:49,105 --> 01:02:51,505
For the moment.

858
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:53,099
And when l return, you and l

859
01:02:53,142 --> 01:02:59,877
shall have a little talk
about showing proper respect.

860
01:03:04,954 --> 01:03:07,354
What's happening to his face?

861
01:03:12,995 --> 01:03:14,929
Commander, a moment.

862
01:03:18,167 --> 01:03:21,694
Are you truly prepared to have
your hands drenched in blood?

863
01:03:22,705 --> 01:03:25,640
He's not planning
to defeat Earth.

864
01:03:25,675 --> 01:03:27,870
He's planning its annihilation.

865
01:03:28,911 --> 01:03:31,971
And his sins will mark us
and our children

866
01:03:32,014 --> 01:03:33,777
for generations.

867
01:03:39,689 --> 01:03:42,556
The more l studied his DNA,
the more confusing it got.

868
01:03:42,592 --> 01:03:44,992
Finally, l could come
to only one conclusion.

869
01:03:45,027 --> 01:03:47,689
Shinzon was created
with temporal RNA sequencing.

870
01:03:48,998 --> 01:03:52,058
He was designed so that, at a
certain point, his aging process

871
01:03:52,101 --> 01:03:54,661
could be accelerated
to reach your age more quickly.

872
01:03:54,704 --> 01:03:58,504
He was engineered to skip
30 years of his life.

873
01:03:58,541 --> 01:04:00,941
But when the temporal sequencing
wasn't activated,

874
01:04:00,977 --> 01:04:04,276
his cellular structure
started breaking down.

875
01:04:04,313 --> 01:04:05,541
He's dying.

876
01:04:06,582 --> 01:04:08,607
Dying?

877
01:04:10,853 --> 01:04:12,252
Can anything be done for him?

878
01:04:12,288 --> 01:04:15,086
Nothing except
a complete transfusion

879
01:04:15,124 --> 01:04:18,719
from the only donor
with compatible DNA-- you.

880
01:04:23,666 --> 01:04:26,134
How long does he have?

881
01:04:26,168 --> 01:04:28,295
l can't say for sure

882
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:32,033
but the rate of decay
seems to be accelerating.

883
01:04:35,177 --> 01:04:38,840
Then he'll come for me.

884
01:05:03,639 --> 01:05:08,736
Brother, l... cannot move.

885
01:05:08,778 --> 01:05:10,769
No. l have only activated

886
01:05:10,813 --> 01:05:14,442
your cognitive
and communication subroutines.

887
01:05:14,483 --> 01:05:15,780
Why?

888
01:05:15,818 --> 01:05:18,286
Because you are dangerous.

889
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,947
Why?

890
01:05:19,989 --> 01:05:22,184
You have been programmed
to gather information

891
01:05:22,224 --> 01:05:23,919
that can be used
against this ship.

892
01:05:24,994 --> 01:05:29,363
l... do not understand.

893
01:05:30,399 --> 01:05:32,833
l know.

894
01:05:35,504 --> 01:05:38,496
Do you know anything
about Shinzon's plans

895
01:05:38,541 --> 01:05:40,975
against the Federation?

896
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:42,841
No.

897
01:05:42,878 --> 01:05:44,641
Do you have any knowledge

898
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,308
of the tactical
abilities of his ship?

899
01:05:47,349 --> 01:05:48,976
No.

900
01:05:50,019 --> 01:05:53,045
Can l move now?

901
01:05:53,088 --> 01:05:55,215
No.

902
01:05:57,259 --> 01:05:59,591
What are you doing?

903
01:06:00,629 --> 01:06:02,859
l must deactivate you.

904
01:06:02,898 --> 01:06:05,423
For how long?

905
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:10,095
lndefinitely.

906
01:06:10,973 --> 01:06:13,305
How long is tha...?

907
01:06:20,149 --> 01:06:24,108
A long time, brother.

908
01:06:24,153 --> 01:06:27,122
lt's called
a Cascading Biogenic Pulse.

909
01:06:27,156 --> 01:06:29,488
The unique properties
of thalaron radiation

910
01:06:29,525 --> 01:06:32,460
allow the energy beam
to expand almost without limit.

911
01:06:32,494 --> 01:06:34,621
Depending on its radiant
intensity,

912
01:06:34,663 --> 01:06:40,795
it could encompass a ship...
or a planet.

913
01:06:40,836 --> 01:06:44,966
He would only have built
a weapon of such scope

914
01:06:45,007 --> 01:06:46,907
for one reason.

915
01:06:47,943 --> 01:06:49,877
He's going after Earth.

916
01:06:49,912 --> 01:06:51,880
How can you be certain?

917
01:06:51,914 --> 01:06:55,008
l know how he thinks.

918
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:58,110
Destroy humanity,
you cripple the Federation.

919
01:06:58,153 --> 01:07:00,087
The Romulans invade.

920
01:07:00,122 --> 01:07:03,250
No way of penetrating his cloak?

921
01:07:03,292 --> 01:07:04,919
No.

922
01:07:05,961 --> 01:07:07,929
So he could pass
within ten meters

923
01:07:07,963 --> 01:07:10,932
of every ship in Starfleet
and they'd never know.

924
01:07:12,301 --> 01:07:14,963
We do have one advantage,
though.

925
01:07:16,238 --> 01:07:18,229
He needs your blood to live.

926
01:07:18,274 --> 01:07:20,401
He might come after you first.

927
01:07:20,442 --> 01:07:22,103
l'm counting on it.

928
01:07:22,144 --> 01:07:24,942
We've been ordered
to sector 1045.

929
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:27,448
Our fleet has been diverted
to meet us there.

930
01:07:27,483 --> 01:07:28,643
Strength in numbers.

931
01:07:28,684 --> 01:07:30,618
Yes. At least,
that's what we hope.

932
01:07:31,654 --> 01:07:35,590
He must not be allowed
to use that weapon.

933
01:07:35,624 --> 01:07:39,924
All other concerns
are secondary.

934
01:07:41,997 --> 01:07:45,023
You understand me?

935
01:07:50,139 --> 01:07:51,697
Yes, sir.

936
01:07:54,843 --> 01:07:58,609
All hands... battle stations.

937
01:08:12,394 --> 01:08:14,453
lnitiate the force field.

938
01:08:33,782 --> 01:08:36,080
Captain's Personal Log,
supplemental.

939
01:08:36,118 --> 01:08:39,417
We're heading toward Federation
space at maximum warp.

940
01:08:39,455 --> 01:08:42,015
The crew has responded
with the dedication

941
01:08:42,057 --> 01:08:43,786
l've come to expect of them.

942
01:08:43,826 --> 01:08:45,487
And like a thousand
other commanders

943
01:08:45,527 --> 01:08:47,290
on a thousand
other battlefields,

944
01:08:47,329 --> 01:08:49,889
l wait for the dawn.

945
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:13,952
How long?

946
01:09:16,291 --> 01:09:20,591
A matter of hours.

947
01:09:20,629 --> 01:09:23,427
We must begin the procedure now.

948
01:09:28,804 --> 01:09:31,068
How long until we reach
the Rift?

949
01:09:33,475 --> 01:09:35,500
Seven minutes.

950
01:09:55,831 --> 01:09:58,698
Data, what's
our current position?

951
01:10:02,171 --> 01:10:05,299
How soon until we reach
the fleet?

952
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:09,970
At our current velocity,
we will arrive at sector 1045

953
01:10:10,012 --> 01:10:12,981
in approximately 40 minutes,
sir.

954
01:10:19,321 --> 01:10:23,883
''For now we see
but through a glass darkly.''

955
01:10:23,926 --> 01:10:25,450
Sir?

956
01:10:25,494 --> 01:10:28,327
He said he is a mirror.

957
01:10:28,363 --> 01:10:30,160
Of you, sir?

958
01:10:30,199 --> 01:10:31,860
Yes.

959
01:10:32,901 --> 01:10:34,732
l do not agree.

960
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:37,864
Although you share
the same genetic structure,

961
01:10:37,906 --> 01:10:39,498
the events of your life

962
01:10:39,541 --> 01:10:41,475
have created
a unique individual.

963
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:43,239
lf l had lived his life,

964
01:10:43,278 --> 01:10:47,009
is it possible that l would've
rejected my humanity?

965
01:10:47,049 --> 01:10:49,176
The B-4 is physically identical

966
01:10:49,218 --> 01:10:51,448
to me, although
his neural pathways

967
01:10:51,487 --> 01:10:52,920
are not as advanced.

968
01:10:52,955 --> 01:10:56,186
But even if they were,
he would not be me.

969
01:10:56,225 --> 01:10:58,352
How can you be sure?

970
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:01,452
l aspire, sir,
to be better than l am.

971
01:11:01,497 --> 01:11:06,298
B-4 does not...
nor does Shinzon.

972
01:11:07,636 --> 01:11:11,265
We are passing through
the Bassen Rift, sir.

973
01:11:11,306 --> 01:11:13,643
The projection will return
when we have cleared it.

974
01:11:13,776 --> 01:11:16,836
lt's interfering with our uplink
from Starfleet cartography?

975
01:11:16,879 --> 01:11:19,507
The Rift affects
all long-range communica...

976
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:24,212
Commander Riker,
evasive maneuvers.

977
01:11:29,859 --> 01:11:32,225
Target weapon systems
and shields.

978
01:11:32,261 --> 01:11:36,755
l don't want the Enterprise
destroyed.

979
01:12:01,390 --> 01:12:05,156
Can you learn to see
in the dark, Captain?

980
01:12:05,194 --> 01:12:06,456
Report.

981
01:12:07,763 --> 01:12:09,731
He's firing through the cloak.
We can't get a lock.

982
01:12:09,765 --> 01:12:12,097
He disabled our warp drive
with his first shot.

983
01:12:12,134 --> 01:12:13,123
We only have impulse, Captain.

984
01:12:13,169 --> 01:12:15,433
Mr. Worf, prepare
a full phaser spread.

985
01:12:15,471 --> 01:12:16,460
Zero elevation.

986
01:12:16,505 --> 01:12:17,301
All banks on my mark.

987
01:12:17,373 --> 01:12:18,840
Scan for shield impact.

988
01:12:18,874 --> 01:12:20,068
Stand by, photon torpedoes.

989
01:12:20,109 --> 01:12:20,973
Aye, sir.

990
01:12:22,678 --> 01:12:23,542
Fire.

991
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:37,991
You're too slow, old man.

992
01:12:38,027 --> 01:12:40,757
Attack pattern Shinzon Theta.

993
01:12:56,378 --> 01:12:58,972
We are losing dorsal shields!

994
01:12:59,014 --> 01:13:01,778
Full axis rotation to port.

995
01:13:01,817 --> 01:13:02,943
Fire all ventral phasers.

996
01:13:14,897 --> 01:13:18,628
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.

997
01:13:18,667 --> 01:13:19,964
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon.

998
01:13:20,002 --> 01:13:21,299
Get the shields on line,
Geordi.

999
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:23,463
l'm already on it.

1000
01:13:24,607 --> 01:13:26,507
Counselor Troi,
report to the Bridge.

1001
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:28,577
Captain...

1002
01:13:28,611 --> 01:13:29,805
we are being hailed.

1003
01:13:29,845 --> 01:13:32,871
On screen.

1004
01:13:32,915 --> 01:13:35,042
Captain Picard...

1005
01:13:37,953 --> 01:13:40,444
will you join me
in your ready room?

1006
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:00,370
You can't trace my holographic
emitters, Captain,

1007
01:14:00,409 --> 01:14:02,468
so don't bother.

1008
01:14:02,511 --> 01:14:04,809
And you can't
contact Starfleet.

1009
01:14:04,847 --> 01:14:07,611
lt's just the two of us now,
Jean-Luc.

1010
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:09,618
As it should be.

1011
01:14:09,652 --> 01:14:11,813
Why are you here?

1012
01:14:11,854 --> 01:14:13,822
To accept your surrender.

1013
01:14:14,857 --> 01:14:18,088
l can clearly destroy you
at any time.

1014
01:14:18,127 --> 01:14:20,095
Lower your shields

1015
01:14:20,129 --> 01:14:22,222
and allow me to transport you
to my ship.

1016
01:14:22,264 --> 01:14:24,289
And the Enterprise?

1017
01:14:26,602 --> 01:14:30,595
l have little interest
in your quaint vessel, Captain.

1018
01:14:30,639 --> 01:14:32,630
Look at me, Shinzon.

1019
01:14:36,178 --> 01:14:38,840
Your heart, your hands...

1020
01:14:38,881 --> 01:14:40,849
your eyes

1021
01:14:40,883 --> 01:14:42,407
are the same as mine.

1022
01:14:42,451 --> 01:14:44,646
The blood pumping within you--

1023
01:14:44,687 --> 01:14:46,917
the raw material is the same.

1024
01:14:46,956 --> 01:14:49,254
We have the same potential.

1025
01:14:49,291 --> 01:14:51,259
That's the past, Captain.

1026
01:14:51,293 --> 01:14:54,091
lt can be the future.

1027
01:14:54,129 --> 01:14:55,323
Buried deep within you,

1028
01:14:55,431 --> 01:14:57,626
beneath all the years
of pain and anger,

1029
01:14:57,666 --> 01:15:00,328
there is something that
has never been nurtured.

1030
01:15:00,369 --> 01:15:04,100
The potential
to make yourself a better man.

1031
01:15:04,139 --> 01:15:06,835
And that is what it is
to be human.

1032
01:15:06,876 --> 01:15:09,572
To make yourself
more than you are.

1033
01:15:12,381 --> 01:15:14,872
Oh, yes.

1034
01:15:14,917 --> 01:15:16,908
l know you.

1035
01:15:18,654 --> 01:15:22,420
There was a time
you looked at the stars

1036
01:15:22,458 --> 01:15:24,653
and dreamed of what might be.

1037
01:15:26,829 --> 01:15:28,990
Childish dreams, Captain,

1038
01:15:29,031 --> 01:15:32,194
lost in the dilithium
mines of Remus.

1039
01:15:33,502 --> 01:15:36,164
l am what you see now.

1040
01:15:36,205 --> 01:15:37,467
l see more than that.

1041
01:15:37,506 --> 01:15:38,973
l see what you could be.

1042
01:15:39,008 --> 01:15:42,171
The man who is Shinzon of Remus
and Jean-Luc Picard

1043
01:15:42,211 --> 01:15:45,806
could never exterminate the
population of an entire planet.

1044
01:15:45,848 --> 01:15:47,213
He's better than that.

1045
01:15:47,249 --> 01:15:50,650
He is what his life
has made him.

1046
01:15:50,686 --> 01:15:53,211
Then, what will you do
with that life?

1047
01:15:53,255 --> 01:15:57,123
Waste it in a blaze of hatred?

1048
01:15:57,159 --> 01:15:58,683
There is a better way.

1049
01:15:58,727 --> 01:16:00,388
lt's too late.

1050
01:16:00,429 --> 01:16:02,158
Never, never.
You still have a choice.

1051
01:16:02,197 --> 01:16:03,255
Make the right one now.

1052
01:16:03,332 --> 01:16:07,063
l can't fight what l am.

1053
01:16:07,102 --> 01:16:09,036
Yes, you can.

1054
01:16:11,573 --> 01:16:15,703
l'll show you my true nature.

1055
01:16:15,744 --> 01:16:17,712
Our nature.

1056
01:16:17,746 --> 01:16:19,805
And as Earth dies,

1057
01:16:19,848 --> 01:16:23,841
remember, l will always
forever be Shinzon

1058
01:16:23,886 --> 01:16:25,911
of Remus.

1059
01:16:25,955 --> 01:16:28,287
And my voice shall echo
through time

1060
01:16:28,324 --> 01:16:33,318
long after yours has faded
to a dim memory.

1061
01:16:54,783 --> 01:16:56,717
Two ships de-cloaking, sir.

1062
01:16:56,752 --> 01:16:58,447
Romulan.

1063
01:17:10,232 --> 01:17:11,597
Captain.

1064
01:17:16,438 --> 01:17:18,963
Just when l thought
this couldn't get any worse.

1065
01:17:20,509 --> 01:17:22,977
We are being hailed.

1066
01:17:23,012 --> 01:17:25,071
On screen.

1067
01:17:26,415 --> 01:17:30,215
Captain Picard,
Commander Donatra

1068
01:17:30,252 --> 01:17:31,583
of the Warbird Valdore.

1069
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:34,487
Might we be of assistance?

1070
01:17:35,524 --> 01:17:37,549
Assistance?

1071
01:17:37,593 --> 01:17:41,154
The Empire considers this
a matter of internal security.

1072
01:17:41,196 --> 01:17:43,323
We regret
you've become involved.

1073
01:17:45,601 --> 01:17:49,503
Commander, when this is over,
l owe you a drink.

1074
01:17:50,773 --> 01:17:52,297
Romulan ale, Captain.

1075
01:17:52,341 --> 01:17:53,569
Let's get to work.

1076
01:17:53,609 --> 01:17:55,941
You heard the lady.

1077
01:17:55,978 --> 01:17:57,468
Let's go to work.

1078
01:18:09,725 --> 01:18:12,193
Mr. Worf, coordinate our attack

1079
01:18:12,227 --> 01:18:14,855
with the Valdore
Tactical Officer.

1080
01:18:14,897 --> 01:18:17,024
Triangulate all fire
on any shield impact.

1081
01:18:17,066 --> 01:18:17,998
Aye, sir.

1082
01:18:27,208 --> 01:18:29,506
Aft shields down to 40 percent.

1083
01:18:29,544 --> 01:18:30,875
Keep our bow on the Scimitar.

1084
01:18:30,912 --> 01:18:33,574
Auxiliary power
to forward shields.

1085
01:18:33,615 --> 01:18:34,604
Aye, sir.

1086
01:18:43,091 --> 01:18:44,888
Target the flanking warbird.

1087
01:18:44,926 --> 01:18:47,053
All forward disruptor banks
on my mark.

1088
01:19:07,082 --> 01:19:09,414
Forward shields
down to 10 percent.

1089
01:19:09,451 --> 01:19:10,645
Bring us about.

1090
01:19:20,128 --> 01:19:21,823
Drop cloak
on the aft port quadrant.

1091
01:19:22,730 --> 01:19:24,755
Prepare for full emergency stop.

1092
01:19:24,799 --> 01:19:25,857
What?

1093
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:27,492
You heard me.

1094
01:19:36,611 --> 01:19:38,579
He's losing his cloak.

1095
01:19:38,613 --> 01:19:41,173
Stand by all forward
disruptor banks.

1096
01:19:44,452 --> 01:19:46,443
She's almost on us.

1097
01:19:48,156 --> 01:19:50,624
Not yet.

1098
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:54,223
Praetor!

1099
01:19:54,262 --> 01:19:55,422
Full stop!

1100
01:19:55,463 --> 01:19:57,158
Fire!

1101
01:20:18,253 --> 01:20:20,983
Restore the aft cloak
and bring us about.

1102
01:20:23,625 --> 01:20:26,992
l'm afraid that drink
will have to wait, Captain.

1103
01:20:27,028 --> 01:20:28,757
Do you have life support?

1104
01:20:28,796 --> 01:20:29,763
For the moment.

1105
01:20:29,797 --> 01:20:32,766
But we're dead in the water.

1106
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,290
Understood.

1107
01:20:43,511 --> 01:20:45,035
We are losing

1108
01:20:45,079 --> 01:20:48,014
structural integrity on decks 12
through 1 7, sections

1109
01:20:48,049 --> 01:20:48,981
four through ten.

1110
01:20:51,653 --> 01:20:53,348
Emergency force fields
are holding.

1111
01:20:53,421 --> 01:20:55,082
Evacuate those decks

1112
01:20:55,123 --> 01:20:58,092
and reroute field power
to forward shields.

1113
01:21:00,395 --> 01:21:02,625
Captain...

1114
01:21:02,664 --> 01:21:06,327
l think l may have a way
to find them.

1115
01:21:08,336 --> 01:21:10,861
Prepare for a lateral run.

1116
01:21:10,905 --> 01:21:14,204
All starboard disruptors.

1117
01:21:19,347 --> 01:21:21,679
What is it?

1118
01:21:23,318 --> 01:21:24,080
What is it?

1119
01:21:26,054 --> 01:21:28,147
She's here.

1120
01:21:57,785 --> 01:21:59,810
He's resisting me.

1121
01:22:13,835 --> 01:22:15,234
No!

1122
01:22:17,672 --> 01:22:20,505
Remember me.

1123
01:22:22,543 --> 01:22:24,170
Now!

1124
01:22:34,922 --> 01:22:36,287
Fire at will.

1125
01:22:47,568 --> 01:22:50,469
Prepare a boarding party.
Bring me Picard.

1126
01:22:53,074 --> 01:22:55,133
You.

1127
01:22:56,511 --> 01:22:58,877
Get the cloak back!

1128
01:22:58,913 --> 01:23:01,381
Target all shield coordinates,
beta three.

1129
01:23:01,416 --> 01:23:02,405
All disruptors, fire.

1130
01:23:11,659 --> 01:23:15,288
Captain, we've lost
central shielding on deck 29.

1131
01:23:15,330 --> 01:23:17,594
Divert all power and compensate.

1132
01:23:21,703 --> 01:23:23,102
lntruder alert.

1133
01:23:24,105 --> 01:23:25,231
Number One.

1134
01:23:25,273 --> 01:23:26,865
Let's go.

1135
01:23:26,908 --> 01:23:29,968
Security detail to deck 29.

1136
01:23:47,695 --> 01:23:50,596
The Romulans fought with honor.

1137
01:23:50,631 --> 01:23:53,464
Yes, they did, Mr. Worf.

1138
01:24:34,942 --> 01:24:36,068
Worf, cover me.

1139
01:26:07,869 --> 01:26:09,860
Medical team to the Bridge.

1140
01:26:22,650 --> 01:26:24,447
...functioning
on reserve power only.

1141
01:26:24,485 --> 01:26:25,782
Did you check the system status?

1142
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:26,878
Report.

1143
01:26:26,921 --> 01:26:29,890
We have exhausted our complement
of photon torpedoes.

1144
01:26:29,924 --> 01:26:32,017
Phaser banks
are down to four percent, sir.

1145
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:33,527
What if we targeted
all our phasers

1146
01:26:33,561 --> 01:26:34,687
in a concentrated pattern?

1147
01:26:34,729 --> 01:26:37,630
The Scimitar's shields
are still at 70 percent.

1148
01:26:37,665 --> 01:26:40,463
lt would make
no difference, Captain.

1149
01:26:44,672 --> 01:26:46,833
We have damage on all decks.

1150
01:26:48,843 --> 01:26:50,401
What's he doing?

1151
01:27:02,156 --> 01:27:04,954
He wants to look me in the eye.

1152
01:27:08,763 --> 01:27:11,231
We've got him.

1153
01:27:14,202 --> 01:27:17,763
He thinks he knows exactly
what l am going to do.

1154
01:27:17,805 --> 01:27:19,830
Geordi, divert all power
to the engines.

1155
01:27:19,874 --> 01:27:22,069
Take it from life support,
if you have to.

1156
01:27:22,110 --> 01:27:23,702
Give me everything you've got.

1157
01:27:27,448 --> 01:27:29,143
Ready, Captain.

1158
01:27:30,251 --> 01:27:31,275
We are being hailed, sir.

1159
01:27:31,386 --> 01:27:34,253
Deanna, stand by.

1160
01:27:34,289 --> 01:27:35,551
Open a channel.

1161
01:27:37,392 --> 01:27:39,724
l hope you're still alive,
Jean-Luc.

1162
01:27:39,761 --> 01:27:41,820
Oh, yes, l am.

1163
01:27:41,863 --> 01:27:45,230
Don't you think it's time
to surrender?

1164
01:27:45,266 --> 01:27:48,724
Why should the rest of your crew
have to die?

1165
01:27:48,770 --> 01:27:52,103
Shinzon, l don't think
l ever told you...

1166
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:53,437
about my first
Academy evaluation.

1167
01:27:53,474 --> 01:27:57,035
ln particular, l was thought
to be extremely...

1168
01:27:57,078 --> 01:28:00,172
...overconfident.

1169
01:28:00,214 --> 01:28:03,547
Captain, as much as l enjoy
listening to you talk,

1170
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:04,778
l really think...

1171
01:28:06,087 --> 01:28:06,917
On my mark, Deanna.

1172
01:28:06,955 --> 01:28:10,447
All hands, brace for impact.

1173
01:28:12,794 --> 01:28:14,261
Engage.

1174
01:28:33,281 --> 01:28:35,647
Hard to port!

1175
01:30:06,674 --> 01:30:09,199
Divert all power to the engines.

1176
01:30:10,545 --> 01:30:12,479
Full reverse.

1177
01:31:25,887 --> 01:31:28,879
No!

1178
01:31:47,475 --> 01:31:48,965
Reconfiguring now.

1179
01:31:51,746 --> 01:31:55,182
Computer, stand by auto-destruct
sequence Omega.

1180
01:31:55,216 --> 01:31:57,852
Recognize voice pattern
Jean-Luc Picard.

1181
01:31:57,985 --> 01:32:01,716
Authorization:
Alpha-Alpha-3-0-5.

1182
01:32:03,090 --> 01:32:05,752
Auto-destruct is off-line.

1183
01:32:26,981 --> 01:32:30,246
Disruptors are not functional,
sir.

1184
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:36,055
Deploy the weapon.

1185
01:32:37,057 --> 01:32:40,754
Kill everything on that ship.

1186
01:32:40,794 --> 01:32:43,126
Then set a course for Earth.

1187
01:32:43,163 --> 01:32:47,896
We must complete our mission.

1188
01:33:02,316 --> 01:33:05,843
Matrix initiated.

1189
01:33:05,886 --> 01:33:07,513
Sequencing procedure

1190
01:33:07,554 --> 01:33:10,387
for thalaron radiation
transfer...

1191
01:33:10,424 --> 01:33:12,449
activated.

1192
01:33:17,698 --> 01:33:21,725
Some ideals are worth dying for,
aren't they, Jean-Luc?

1193
01:33:34,214 --> 01:33:37,672
Thalaron intermix procedure
initiated.

1194
01:33:39,954 --> 01:33:42,684
Deployment of targeting arms
commencing.

1195
01:34:05,813 --> 01:34:08,043
How long until he can fire?

1196
01:34:12,119 --> 01:34:13,518
The targeting sequence
should take

1197
01:34:13,554 --> 01:34:15,112
about seven minutes, Captain.

1198
01:34:15,155 --> 01:34:16,486
When the targeting arms

1199
01:34:16,523 --> 01:34:19,424
are fully deployed,
the matrix on the Bridge

1200
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:21,655
will relay
the thalaron radiation

1201
01:34:21,695 --> 01:34:23,993
to the firing points
at their tips.

1202
01:34:24,031 --> 01:34:26,556
No one on the Enterprise
will survive.

1203
01:34:30,404 --> 01:34:32,634
How can he?
He'll kill you.

1204
01:34:32,673 --> 01:34:35,107
lt's not about me anymore.

1205
01:34:38,812 --> 01:34:41,303
Prepare
for a site-to-site transport.

1206
01:34:41,382 --> 01:34:42,713
Captain, l don't think
that the transpor...

1207
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:44,012
That's an order, Commander.

1208
01:34:44,051 --> 01:34:45,018
Sir, allow me to go.

1209
01:34:45,052 --> 01:34:46,815
Data, this is something
l have to do.

1210
01:34:46,854 --> 01:34:47,821
-Sir...
-Data.

1211
01:34:47,855 --> 01:34:49,789
You have the Bridge, Commander.

1212
01:34:49,823 --> 01:34:53,520
Try and put some distance
between you and the Scimitar.

1213
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:55,425
Now, Mr. La Forge.

1214
01:34:55,462 --> 01:34:57,089
Aye, sir.

1215
01:35:05,973 --> 01:35:07,235
That's it.

1216
01:35:07,274 --> 01:35:08,673
Transporters are down.

1217
01:35:13,981 --> 01:35:16,381
The system is fused.

1218
01:35:16,417 --> 01:35:18,851
Counselor Troi,
please assume command.

1219
01:35:18,886 --> 01:35:20,683
Geordi, come with me.

1220
01:36:16,376 --> 01:36:18,276
Thalaron intermix level...

1221
01:36:18,345 --> 01:36:21,837
30 percent.

1222
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:49,238
Four minutes to firing sequence.

1223
01:37:28,916 --> 01:37:33,114
Thalaron intermix level,
50 percent.

1224
01:37:45,732 --> 01:37:48,667
Three minutes
to firing sequence.

1225
01:38:09,256 --> 01:38:13,886
Thalaron intermix level,
60 percent.

1226
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:13,184
Two minutes to firing sequence.

1227
01:39:35,942 --> 01:39:40,879
Thalaron intermix level,
80 percent.

1228
01:40:05,571 --> 01:40:10,065
l'm glad we're together now.

1229
01:40:10,109 --> 01:40:13,875
Our destiny's complete.

1230
01:40:23,990 --> 01:40:26,823
One minute to firing sequence.

1231
01:40:29,228 --> 01:40:32,163
Thalaron intermix level
completed.

1232
01:40:49,315 --> 01:40:52,876
30 seconds to firing sequence.

1233
01:41:04,197 --> 01:41:08,099
Good-bye.

1234
01:41:08,134 --> 01:41:11,160
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

1235
01:41:11,204 --> 01:41:16,506
six, five, four, three...

1236
01:41:43,469 --> 01:41:45,334
Data?

1237
01:42:15,735 --> 01:42:17,134
Captain...

1238
01:42:23,442 --> 01:42:25,137
lt's Data.

1239
01:42:45,898 --> 01:42:48,992
Captain, we're being hailed.

1240
01:42:49,035 --> 01:42:50,366
On screen.

1241
01:42:52,405 --> 01:42:55,101
Open a channel.

1242
01:42:55,141 --> 01:42:58,167
This is Commander Donatra
of the Valdore.

1243
01:42:58,211 --> 01:43:03,114
We're dispatching shuttles with
medical personnel and supplies.

1244
01:43:05,184 --> 01:43:06,879
Thank you, Commander.

1245
01:43:06,919 --> 01:43:08,284
You've earned a friend

1246
01:43:08,387 --> 01:43:10,787
in the Romulan Empire today,
Captain.

1247
01:43:10,823 --> 01:43:14,281
l hope the first of many.

1248
01:43:14,327 --> 01:43:15,692
Valdore out.

1249
01:43:20,566 --> 01:43:26,869
Geordi, prepare the shuttlebay
for arrivals.

1250
01:43:26,906 --> 01:43:31,138
They, uh, they don't
know our procedures.

1251
01:43:33,813 --> 01:43:35,303
Just open the doors.

1252
01:43:35,381 --> 01:43:37,315
l'll take care of it, Captain.

1253
01:43:37,383 --> 01:43:39,613
You have the Bridge, Number One.

1254
01:43:56,435 --> 01:43:57,868
Thank you.

1255
01:44:10,483 --> 01:44:12,348
To absent friends.

1256
01:44:16,689 --> 01:44:18,714
To family.

1257
01:44:39,011 --> 01:44:42,310
First time l saw Data,
he was leaning against a tree

1258
01:44:42,381 --> 01:44:45,475
in the holodeck
trying to whistle.

1259
01:44:45,518 --> 01:44:47,110
Funniest thing l ever saw.

1260
01:44:49,188 --> 01:44:50,621
No matter what he did,
he couldn't get

1261
01:44:50,656 --> 01:44:53,216
the tune right.

1262
01:44:53,259 --> 01:44:57,628
What was that song?

1263
01:44:57,663 --> 01:45:01,326
Can't remember the song.

1264
01:45:31,998 --> 01:45:33,465
Come.

1265
01:45:35,401 --> 01:45:36,925
Will.

1266
01:45:36,969 --> 01:45:38,732
Permission to disembark, sir.

1267
01:45:38,771 --> 01:45:40,261
Granted.

1268
01:45:40,306 --> 01:45:44,868
So... where's the Titan
off to?

1269
01:45:44,910 --> 01:45:46,468
The Neutral Zone.

1270
01:45:46,512 --> 01:45:48,707
We're heading up
the new task force.

1271
01:45:48,748 --> 01:45:51,808
Apparently the Romulans
are interested in talking.

1272
01:45:51,851 --> 01:45:54,786
Well, l can't think of
a better man for the job.

1273
01:45:54,820 --> 01:45:59,655
lf l may, just a word of advice
about your first command?

1274
01:45:59,692 --> 01:46:00,989
Anything.

1275
01:46:01,027 --> 01:46:02,756
When your First Officer

1276
01:46:02,795 --> 01:46:05,593
insists that you can't
go on away missions...

1277
01:46:05,631 --> 01:46:07,565
lgnore him.

1278
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:10,000
l intend to.

1279
01:46:14,339 --> 01:46:19,675
Serving with you
has been an honor.

1280
01:46:21,479 --> 01:46:24,642
The honor was mine, Captain.

1281
01:46:40,098 --> 01:46:43,499
l don't know if all this
has made any sense,

1282
01:46:43,535 --> 01:46:46,800
but l wanted you to know
what kind of man he was.

1283
01:46:46,838 --> 01:46:49,705
ln his quest to be more like us

1284
01:46:49,741 --> 01:46:53,677
he helped us to see
what it means to be human.

1285
01:46:55,847 --> 01:46:58,077
My...

1286
01:46:58,116 --> 01:47:01,574
my brother was not human?

1287
01:47:01,619 --> 01:47:05,953
No, he wasn't.

1288
01:47:05,990 --> 01:47:07,787
But his wonder,

1289
01:47:07,826 --> 01:47:10,624
his curiosity about every facet

1290
01:47:10,662 --> 01:47:13,187
of human nature
allowed all of us

1291
01:47:13,231 --> 01:47:15,927
to see the best parts
of ourselves.

1292
01:47:15,967 --> 01:47:18,060
He evolved.

1293
01:47:18,102 --> 01:47:19,797
He embraced change

1294
01:47:19,838 --> 01:47:24,605
because he always wanted to be
better than he was.

1295
01:47:27,512 --> 01:47:30,140
l...

1296
01:47:30,181 --> 01:47:33,173
l do not understand.

1297
01:47:37,589 --> 01:47:40,149
Well, l hope someday you will.

1298
01:47:42,327 --> 01:47:45,660
Captain, the warp engines
are ready to go on line.

1299
01:47:45,697 --> 01:47:47,187
l'm on my way.

1300
01:47:47,232 --> 01:47:49,666
Please inform
Commander La Forge.

1301
01:47:54,239 --> 01:47:55,797
We'll talk later.

1302
01:47:58,476 --> 01:48:00,774
Never saw the sun

1303
01:48:03,081 --> 01:48:06,346
Never saw the sun

1304
01:48:08,786 --> 01:48:12,153
Never saw the sun

1305
01:48:13,625 --> 01:48:16,253
Shining so bright...

1306
01:48:16,294 --> 01:48:19,491
Shining so bright

1307
01:48:19,531 --> 01:48:23,023
Never saw things...

1308
01:48:26,604 --> 01:48:30,404
Going so right.

1309
01:48:30,441 --> 01:48:33,137
Going so right...
