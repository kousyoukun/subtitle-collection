Fee structure... A number?

97
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,331
Yeah, we need to adjust the overall payment

98
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:22,334
in order that we can address things
like hazard bumps.

99
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:26,630
I'll make a list.
But also how the installments are spaced.

100
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,381

and Jamie's running late.

106

This is a short timetable, Kenneth.
Should I be nervous?

107
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,400
If it will make you feel better,

108
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,904
you can get the people
that did the Mexico job, Alex.

but you want to start going through this?
I've got some ideas.

119
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,071
What about him?

120
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:36,157
How long have you worked together?

121
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,784
Three years.

122
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,414
Not so long.

123
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,000
It is in this business.

124
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,167
COBLENZ: You said fourpoints.

125
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,004
You have Mallory Kane
as an essential element.

126
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,046
Is that a problem?

127
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,591
Not a good precedent for me,
for my business.

128
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,634
Well, it doesn't work for us
if she's not involved.

129
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,303
She's not available.

130
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,889
You mind if I call and check on that?

131
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,019
I didn't realize
your interest extended to personnel.

132
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:08,148
No, no. No, when somebody's good,
it comes to my attention.

133
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:11,151
It's come to my attention
you're spreading yourself a little thin.

134
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,653
Kenneth, I don't want your B-team.
She's value-added.

135
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,740
Only reason we came to you.

136
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,577
All right, I'll free her up.

137
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,830
And I'll forego the hazard bumps
if you remove the essential element clause.

138
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,750
- That important, huh?
- Do you want her in Barcelona or not?

139
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:38,488
AARON: Explain it to me then.
So I can understand it.

140
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,782
How are we not light?

141
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,993
So we have a man in the car,
we got a man at the door.

142
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,829
Leaves you two to breach with.

There's two rooms inside.

145
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,335
So, the way I read it,

146
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,797
you're either two men short in one room,
or you're one man short in each room.

147
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,842
Anyone else think we're light?

Us?

149
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,430
No way.

150
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:10,019

Let me turn the volume up a little here.

afterwards. We'll go to Majorca.

- Not like before, as friends.

01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:53,041
Repeat, 2345 Clearview, and hold.

489
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:56,128
Federal agents en route.

490
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:57,713
OFFICER 1: Unit three, copy.

491
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:00,841
OFFICER 2:
You must have stepped in something.

492
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:02,259
OFFICER 1: Yeah.

493
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,680
Excuse me, Deputy Cross?

494
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:08,724
Deputy Cross? Hi.

495
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:12,102
You were in the Corps, right?
I was a devil dog.

496
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:15,439
Listen, this might sound a little funny.

497
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:18,191
I'm a private contractor
on a 10-24 operation,

498
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:20,569
and these guys you're about to meet
are not federal agents.

499
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,405
I mean, follow your protocol and all,

500
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:25,365
but you should really keep your distance.

501
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:29,745
Use your radio and your loudspeakers
in order to confirm who these guys aren't.

502
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,538
Really, I'm not joking.

503
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:34,958
You can look me up,
a New Mexico license for Mallory Kane.

504
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:36,877
I'll confirm the number.

505
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:39,004
You need to sit back.

506
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:42,382
Look, an innocent civilian will be killed
if you do not listen to me.

507
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:45,844
Hey, Wonder Woman, you said your piece.
Now sit back and shut up.

508
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:37,187
(GUNSHOTS)

509
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:51,243
- Jesus, are you...
- Get down!

01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:56,832
(GUNSHOTS)

511
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:04,422
Just keep your head down
a few more minutes and you're out of this.

512
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:07,759
Great, great. How are you gonna
get out of this, may I ask?

513
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:11,054
I'll just dump the car.
I'll find another ride. I'll catch a bus.

514
01:04:11,138 --> 01:04:12,722
Great, good luck with that.

515
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:14,891
I can't wait till Coblenz hears about this.

516
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:17,227
- What is that?
- Listen, when we split,

517
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:19,187
I'm gonna give you a number to call.

518
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:22,482
I was supposed to be sleeping in late today,

519
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:24,442
not getting carjacked.

520
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,861
Scott, you still with me?

521
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:29,239
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, a number.
- Just tell them everything.

522
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:32,367
Tell the police, too,
tell them everything I've told you, okay?

523
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:34,327
- Yeah, okay.
- You did great.

524
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:36,913
- You're gonna be fine.
- Yeah. Okay.

525
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:41,084
This is the trouble
with the private sector, Kenneth.

526
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:44,421
You got that macho takedown,
but where's the due diligence?

527
01:04:44,505 --> 01:04:45,755
Where's the follow-through?

528
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:50,552
Now, we got ourselves a real twizzler here.

529
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:53,346
And for eight figures,
I don't accept excuses,

530
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:56,516
explanations or rationales.

531
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:59,060
Now I don't even know
why the hell you're standing here.

532
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:02,439
You should be in her father's living room,
explaining to him,

533
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:06,610
telling him that his daughter
is a fugitive with ties to terrorists.

534
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:09,905
That she killed a man in cold blood
in Dublin and killed four cops.

535
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:12,782
You tell him.

536
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:15,118
Show him.

537
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:17,954
MALLORY: He'll come at you
like he's government,

538
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:19,748
make me seem like a monster.

539
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:23,209
Play like you're shocked.

540
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:26,087
The guy with the broken arm, Aaron,

541
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,339
get in his head.

542
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:29,507
Keep bringing up Barcelona.

543
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,801
Get him arguing with Kenneth.

544
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:33,887
Kenneth.

545
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:37,557
My fault. I should've seen that one coming.

546
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,726
You did.

547
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:44,064
Hold up a sec, Mal.
Let's analyze your options.

548
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:46,483
We could leave right now, disappear.

549
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:49,653
We could be in Buenos Aires
this time tomorrow.

550
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:54,866
I'm not gonna run anymore.

551
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:02,415
KENNETH: Mr. Kane, these were taken
by the police. They're pretty graphic.

552
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:06,920
Her prints are all over the room.

553
01:06:07,004 --> 01:06:10,715
The security video shows them
coming in together and her leaving alone.

554
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,469
The guest downstairs
complained about the noise.

555
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:16,262
Paul fought back,

556
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,682
but she obviously had
the element of surprise in her favor.

557
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:22,018
She choked him out
and she shot him in the head.

558
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:27,732
Add that to the four police,
and that is five dead in three days.

559
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:32,153
- Where was she last seen?
- Upstate New York, 36 hours ago.

560
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:35,657
- Was she alone?
- No, she was with a boy, 19.

561
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:38,493
She grabbed him at gunpoint.
Used him as a ride and a shield,

562
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:41,454
so we can add aggravated kidnapping
to the murder charges.

563
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,000
No, I'm sorry.

564
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:48,420
This doesn't sound like my daughter.

565
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:54,050
She ever mention the name Kenneth?

566
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:55,593
No.

567
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:58,138
KENNETH: Really?

568
01:06:58,222 --> 01:07:00,682
He runs the company she worked for.

569
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:04,853
They were in a relationship for over a year,
and yet she never mentioned him to you?

570
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:07,647
What do you know about her?

571
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,983
Really, at the end of the day?

572
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:11,693
I raised her.

573
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:14,821
KENNETH: And denial is
a very effective parenting tool.

574
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:16,364
MR. KANE: She was a Marine.
She does something,

575
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:17,907
there must be a reason for it.

576
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:21,661
Mr. Kane, she is no longer a Marine.
She is a murderer.

577
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:24,289
She is a public threat.
She's on a killing spree.

578
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:28,710
Now, you are the only person
that she can trust.

579
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:31,087
You're gonna help bring her in
before she kills again.

580
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:33,757
Without you, she won't survive this.

581
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:46,936
I heard from her.

582
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:49,606
Ten days ago.

583
01:07:50,274 --> 01:07:53,193
She texted me,
said she was going to Barcelona.

584
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:55,820
What did she say exactly?

585
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,782
"Going to Barcelona. Call you after."

586
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:00,867
Six words, that's it?

587
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:02,410
Well, it was enough for me.

588
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:05,038
And she didn't mention Dublin?
She didn't say anything about this?

589
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:06,206
No.

590
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:10,710
Who was he?

591
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:13,671
He was an agent with British Intelligence.

592
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:18,593
Now, whether this was a murder-for-hire
or a crime of passion, we don't know.

593
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:20,136
Well, she would never kill someone
for money.

594
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:21,429
There must be an explanation.

595
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:24,349
Didn't this all start after Barcelona?

596
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,726
Maybe that has something to do
with why she's a fugitive.

597
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:28,228
Something must have happened there.

Just be careful.

608
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:11,271
Mallory, I hope you've decided
to turn yourself in.

609
01:09:11,355 --> 01:09:13,606
You can tell me right now
why you sold me out

610
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:15,316
and what you're into with Studer,

611
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:16,901
or you can tell me in ten minutes,

612

when I have my hands around your throat.

613

You need to think for a minute, Mallory.

614
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:23,616
You need to stop pretending

615
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:26,327
you can achieve a desirable outcome
in this situation,

616

All right, Kenneth. We'll do it your way.

621

She's...

622
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:42,135
She's here.

623
01:09:42,386 --> 01:09:43,386
Here? Where?

624
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:46,973
In the house. Track says she's in the house.
Go, now. You sit down.

625
01:09:47,057 --> 01:09:48,725
You knew about this?
You knew she was here?

626
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:53,521
No. I told you, I haven't heard from her
since she texted me.

about Barcelona?

Aaron, you were in Barcelona.
You know what happened.

- Did we?
- Aaron, you need to focus right now.

You were in Barcelona?
