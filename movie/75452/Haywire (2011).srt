1
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:55,618
Shit.

2
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:24,943
What the hell are you doing out here?

3
00:02:26,406 --> 00:02:28,192
I had to drive all night.

4
00:02:32,537 --> 00:02:33,697
I am hungover as shit.

5
00:02:34,498 --> 00:02:37,405
And you're really starting to cut into
my vacation time, so can we go, please?

6
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:42,707
We will take my car. Come on.
I don't think so.

7
00:02:45,592 --> 00:02:48,004
Why you making..
Why are you going to make this difficult?

8
00:02:49,262 --> 00:02:52,880
What's difficult? He turns himself in.
Then it's easy.

9
00:02:54,017 --> 00:02:56,053
Turns himself in. Why would he do that?

10
00:02:58,313 --> 00:03:02,972
What exactly did he say I did? He didn't.
He just said to come pick you up.

11
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:05,604
Nothing else? Nothing about Barcelona?

12
00:03:05,605 --> 00:03:10,022
No. Nothing about Dublin?
Nothing about Paul?

13
00:03:16,248 --> 00:03:18,329
Hi. Can I get you something?

14
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,907
- Need a minute?
- You all have beer?

15
00:03:20,836 --> 00:03:24,578
No, I wish. Just a coffee. Black.

16
00:03:28,677 --> 00:03:32,503
Okay, if you got something to say,
say it. Aaron..

17
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,840
Have you even seen him?

18
00:03:38,228 --> 00:03:39,308
No.

19
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:54,615
You're really not getting in the car,
are you? No.

20
00:03:59,624 --> 00:04:02,081
- Thank you.
- Have you got any..

21
00:04:04,796 --> 00:04:06,878
You need to get in the car, Mallory.

22
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:01,512
- You got a car? You got a car?
- What?

23
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,350
- Which one?
- This one.

24
00:05:03,351 --> 00:05:07,556
No, no, passenger side.
Give me your keys. Here. Keys.

25
00:05:14,574 --> 00:05:16,529
What's happening?
Where are you taking me?

26
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,449
Put your seatbelt on.

27
00:05:21,915 --> 00:05:23,200
Shit.

28
00:05:26,336 --> 00:05:28,997
- What's your name?
- Scott.

29
00:05:28,998 --> 00:05:30,453
- I am Mallory.
- Hi.

30
00:05:30,454 --> 00:05:33,540
You're going to fix my arm
while we drive. Okay, Scott?

31
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,841
Yeah.

32
00:05:46,731 --> 00:05:48,892
Okay. Here. Ready?

33
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:58,488
- Okay.
- Now take two of the dry packets,

34
00:05:58,489 --> 00:06:01,535
put them on the one
you already have in place.

35
00:06:03,248 --> 00:06:04,953
- Yeah?
- Now take the tape,

36
00:06:04,954 --> 00:06:08,124
wrap it around the gauze
so it stays on my arm.

37
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,165
- Tight.
- Yeah.

38
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,587
- Sorry.
- Couple times around.

39
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:15,415
- Watch your arm.
- Yeah.

40
00:06:17,095 --> 00:06:19,506
Okay, now tape..
Use the scissors to cut it.

41
00:06:19,507 --> 00:06:22,339
- Okay.
- Okay.

42
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,595
That should be good for now.

43
00:06:25,312 --> 00:06:27,552
Jesus Christ.

44
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,638
- I am hyperventilating.
- Scott.

45
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,644
Thank you.

46
00:06:32,645 --> 00:06:33,771
Yeah, sure.

47
00:06:34,696 --> 00:06:36,856
So, who..

48
00:06:36,857 --> 00:06:38,483
Who was that guy?

49
00:06:38,484 --> 00:06:41,111
- I mean, honestly.
- Aaron?

50
00:06:41,112 --> 00:06:43,283
Someone I worked with.

51
00:06:43,284 --> 00:06:47,329
- Was he your.. You know.
- No.

52
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,622
No.

53
00:06:48,623 --> 00:06:50,574
Where did you work with him?

54
00:06:50,575 --> 00:06:52,080
Barcelona.

55
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:56,171
I..

56
00:06:56,172 --> 00:06:59,170
I don't mean to,
you know, get personal.

57
00:06:59,171 --> 00:07:01,877
- Are you in the drug business?
- No.

58
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:04,429
Are you with the government?

59
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,882
They contracted a company I work for.

60
00:07:06,883 --> 00:07:10,014
Private company.

61
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:12,517
Wow. That's actually real?

62
00:07:12,518 --> 00:07:15,065
- Yeah.
- That makes sense.

63
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:16,734
So what do you do? What's your job?

64
00:07:20,325 --> 00:07:22,111
Barcelona. Separatists?

65
00:07:22,827 --> 00:07:24,782
No, no. It's clean.

66
00:07:24,783 --> 00:07:28,363
Negotiations broke down,
just need somebody to go and get the guy.

67
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:32,000
Okay, whatever.

68
00:07:41,346 --> 00:07:42,926
In four points,

69
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:45,755
a better immunity language,
more access to intelligence,

70
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,636
this fee structure is unacceptable.

71
00:07:48,687 --> 00:07:49,675
Intelligence?

72
00:07:49,676 --> 00:07:54,996
Yeah, I need parity with Rodrigo here
and all his people. Todos.

73
00:07:56,152 --> 00:07:57,983
You're with State, right?

74
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,361
Yes.

75
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:02,905
You like it?

76
00:08:03,827 --> 00:08:06,818
I like the idea of me doing my job

77
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,745
more than the idea
of someone else doing my job.

78
00:08:09,746 --> 00:08:14,326
All right, now the immunity language
is as good as we can do.

79
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,878
Fee structure.. A number?

80
00:08:17,382 --> 00:08:19,337
Yeah, we need to adjust the overall payment

81
00:08:19,338 --> 00:08:22,338
in order that we can address things
like hazard bumps.

82
00:08:22,595 --> 00:08:26,633
I will make a list.
But also how the installments are spaced.

83
00:08:26,634 --> 00:08:28,386
Fewer steps.

84
00:08:28,893 --> 00:08:29,643
Hi.

85
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:32,264
Hey.

86
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:33,639
What, am I first?

87
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,520
Yeah, Victor will be here at 4:30,
and Jamie's running late.

88
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,356
There's always a cash flow problem.

89
00:08:42,574 --> 00:08:45,566
This is a short timetable, Kenneth.
Should I be nervous?

90
00:08:46,244 --> 00:08:47,403
If it will make you feel better,

91
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:50,908
you can get the people
that did the Mexico job, Alex.

92
00:08:54,252 --> 00:08:56,663
Look, I know it's more efficient
if we wait for everybody to get here,

93
00:08:56,664 --> 00:09:00,872
but you want to start going through this?
I have got some ideas.

94
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:05,301
You're right. It's more efficient
if we wait for everyone to get here.

95
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:10,506
This should be fun.

96
00:09:10,507 --> 00:09:12,717
- Your kit's under your bed.
- Yours check out?

97
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:16,520
- Good to go.
- I will check later then, thank you.

98
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:19,599
There's no smoking in here.

99
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,104
Okay.

100
00:09:23,948 --> 00:09:25,563
It's a phone.

101
00:09:27,494 --> 00:09:29,530
Tell me about Kenneth.

102
00:09:30,955 --> 00:09:33,070
What about him?

103
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:36,157
How long have you worked together?

104
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,788
Three years.

105
00:09:40,465 --> 00:09:42,420
Not so long.

106
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:44,999
It is in this business.

107
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,175
You said four points.

108
00:09:46,638 --> 00:09:49,003
You have Mallory Kane
as an essential element.

109
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:50,053
Is that a problem?

110
00:09:50,054 --> 00:09:52,597
Not a good precedent for me,
for my business.

111
00:09:52,598 --> 00:09:54,640
Well, it doesn't work for us
if she's not involved.

112
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:56,310
She's not available.

113
00:09:57,315 --> 00:09:59,897
You mind if I call and check on that?

114
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,026
I didn't realize
your interest extended to personnel.

115
00:10:04,027 --> 00:10:08,152
No, no. No, when somebody's good,
it comes to my attention.

116
00:10:08,153 --> 00:10:11,154
It's come to my attention
you're spreading yourself a little thin.

117
00:10:11,155 --> 00:10:13,658
Kenneth, I don't want your B-team.
She's value-added.

118
00:10:14,624 --> 00:10:16,740
Only reason we came to you.

119
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:20,580
All right, I will free her up.

120
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:23,834
And I will forego the hazard bumps
if you remove the essential element clause.

121
00:10:23,835 --> 00:10:26,758
- That important, huh?
- Do you want her in Barcelona or not?

122
00:11:34,746 --> 00:11:38,489
Explain it to me then.
So I can understand it.

123
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:40,782
How are we not light?

124
00:11:41,544 --> 00:11:44,000
So we have a man in the car,
we got a man at the door.

125
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:45,828
Leaves you two to breach with.

126
00:11:46,507 --> 00:11:48,087
You're going hot on a hostage rescue.

127
00:11:48,088 --> 00:11:50,336
There's two rooms inside.

128
00:11:50,337 --> 00:11:52,338
So, the way I read it,

129
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:55,797
you're either two men short in one room,
or you're one man short in each room.

130
00:11:57,352 --> 00:11:58,842
Anyone else think we're light?

131
00:12:00,063 --> 00:12:01,178
Us?

132
00:12:02,273 --> 00:12:03,433
No way.

133
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:05,769
Good to go.

134
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,019
Good to go.

135
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:52,300
You tracking me with the names?

136
00:16:52,301 --> 00:16:53,886
Repeat them.

137
00:16:55,066 --> 00:16:58,307
Mallory. Kenneth. Aaron.

138
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:02,519
Jamie. Victor. Rodrigo.

139
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,980
Barcelona.

140
00:17:04,981 --> 00:17:08,317
Hostage name.

141
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,742
- Yang.
- Jiang.

142
00:17:09,743 --> 00:17:11,991
Shit. Jiang. Jiang.

143
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,824
Don't speak. Walk in front of me.

144
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:19,458
If I touch you, drop to your knees.
Do you understand?

145
00:18:03,968 --> 00:18:05,128
Done.

146
00:18:15,771 --> 00:18:18,307
They all gone?

147
00:18:18,308 --> 00:18:19,730
Yeah.

148
00:18:22,987 --> 00:18:26,524
When that guy took off,
why'd you chase him?

149
00:18:26,525 --> 00:18:29,573
We already had Jiang in the backseat.

150
00:18:29,574 --> 00:18:31,651
I don't like loose ends.

151
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:39,244
Is this your idea of relaxing?

152
00:18:39,245 --> 00:18:42,248
Wine and gun maintenance?

153
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:45,172
There's another glass in the kitchen.

154
00:18:45,173 --> 00:18:46,840
You going to leave your name
and number afterwards?

155
00:18:48,554 --> 00:18:50,510
Why? You want it?

156
00:18:58,356 --> 00:19:00,472
You're going to leave Kenneth?

157
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,691
I left Kenneth six months ago.

158
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,736
I meant the company.

159
00:19:08,737 --> 00:19:10,654
You're going to leave the company?

160
00:19:10,655 --> 00:19:13,779
Company, I left an hour ago.

161
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,361
How come?

162
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,616
Because I am not going down with the ship.

163
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,121
Are you?

164
00:19:24,882 --> 00:19:27,624
If he's paying, yeah, I am staying.

165
00:19:31,013 --> 00:19:33,424
If you stay..

166
00:19:33,425 --> 00:19:35,381
I don't know, maybe..

167
00:21:26,212 --> 00:21:26,962
Hi.

168
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:29,961
What are you doing here?

169
00:21:30,883 --> 00:21:32,247
Gate key still worked.

170
00:21:32,248 --> 00:21:35,049
I didn't change everyone's locks,
just mine.

171
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,672
Hey, I came by
because you weren't picking up.

172
00:21:36,673 --> 00:21:39,630
- I just landed.
- Yeah, two hours ago.

173
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,595
I have been away for nine weeks.
That was my third job in a row.

174
00:21:42,596 --> 00:21:44,016
Give me a break.

175
00:21:44,017 --> 00:21:45,593
You wouldn't know what to do with a break.

176
00:21:45,594 --> 00:21:47,350
You think you know me?

177
00:21:48,901 --> 00:21:50,357
I know you.

178
00:21:54,907 --> 00:21:57,238
I bet he's just like his books.

179
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:58,940
- What?
- Your father.

180
00:21:58,941 --> 00:22:01,401
I bet he's just like the characters
in his books.

181
00:22:01,402 --> 00:22:02,485
How would you know?

182
00:22:02,486 --> 00:22:05,117
You have never read one of his books
and you have never met him.

183
00:22:05,118 --> 00:22:07,495
I am just going off his photograph.

184
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:10,290
What do you want?

185
00:22:11,757 --> 00:22:14,293
The usual. I have an assignment.

186
00:22:14,294 --> 00:22:17,126
Well, your timing sucks.
I haven't even unpacked yet.

187
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,882
This will take no time at all.
It's like a paid holiday.

188
00:22:19,883 --> 00:22:21,885
This will take no time at
all starting when?

189
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:24,800
Well, tonight.

190
00:22:25,437 --> 00:22:28,224
I mean, you would have to leave tonight.

191
00:22:29,316 --> 00:22:33,604
Well, if it is a paid holiday,
then it doesn't have to be me.

192
00:22:33,605 --> 00:22:35,402
I am overqualified.

193
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,191
The client has asked for you.

194
00:22:41,192 --> 00:22:44,653
Mallory, it's MI6.
It's a new in for me. I can expand.

195
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,408
Yeah, sounds great. For you.

196
00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:47,989
Let me turn the volume up a little here.

197
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,541
You probably heard me
mention the name Paul.

198
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:52,710
Paul. Never, not once.

199
00:22:52,711 --> 00:22:56,210
Well, Paul, he's one of us,
but he's freelance.

200
00:22:56,211 --> 00:22:58,166
Actually, I was hoping
you might convince him to come aboard,

201
00:22:58,167 --> 00:22:59,421
but that's secondary.

202
00:22:59,422 --> 00:23:03,175
Paul has managed to get close
to a curious character named Studer,

203
00:23:03,176 --> 00:23:05,928
and our client
wants to take advantage of this.

204
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:09,011
Studer is a French national
residing in Ireland.

205
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,845
It's tricky, they want a light footprint.

206
00:23:10,846 --> 00:23:14,182
- Well, you have got Paul.
- I have got Paul, but Paul..

207
00:23:14,183 --> 00:23:17,896
Paul has presented himself
as one half of a power couple.

208
00:23:20,492 --> 00:23:21,948
This is your pitch?

209
00:23:22,161 --> 00:23:23,696
You want me to be eye candy?

210
00:23:23,697 --> 00:23:25,903
MI6 wants me to be eye candy?

211
00:23:26,165 --> 00:23:28,030
Mallory, you are the eye.

212
00:23:30,794 --> 00:23:32,579
I don't even know how to play that.

213
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,911
I don't wear the dress.

214
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:38,749
- Make Paul wear the dress.
- Well, I will ask.

215
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,928
Look, do this and then we will go away
afterwards. We will go to Majorca.

216
00:23:44,308 --> 00:23:47,299
- Majorca?
- Not like before, as friends.

217
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,884
You can take a break.

218
00:23:49,939 --> 00:23:52,021
It's literally two days.

219
00:23:53,192 --> 00:23:55,607
Paul. That's Paul.

220
00:23:57,071 --> 00:23:59,938
You guys would be
like the perfect couple.

221
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,650
So he will know you.

222
00:24:07,498 --> 00:24:09,534
I need this to happen.

223
00:24:25,724 --> 00:24:27,339
- Hi.
- Hi.

224
00:24:33,607 --> 00:24:36,064
My better half. You look great.

225
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,756
Mind if I freshen up first?

226
00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:54,181
Presumably, you will need more time.

227
00:25:55,397 --> 00:25:56,887
Go ahead.

228
00:27:27,489 --> 00:27:28,569
All yours.

229
00:28:22,336 --> 00:28:25,874
Wow. You look fantastic.

230
00:28:28,592 --> 00:28:30,253
Can you zip me?

231
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,920
Of course.

232
00:28:48,237 --> 00:28:51,104
- I am leaving my gun.
- Me, too.

233
00:29:14,012 --> 00:29:15,502
Shall we?

234
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,011
Russborough. Remember Russborough.

235
00:30:02,811 --> 00:30:04,391
Russborough.

236
00:30:04,392 --> 00:30:05,809
Who's Russborough?

237
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:08,388
Not a who. A what. A place.

238
00:30:11,194 --> 00:30:14,106
It's where we were supposed to meet Studer.

239
00:30:32,966 --> 00:30:35,207
Not your natural habitat, is it?

240
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,936
Wrong side of the tracks.

241
00:30:48,937 --> 00:30:50,139
Kept getting into fights.

242
00:30:51,234 --> 00:30:52,724
Bleak future.

243
00:30:54,071 --> 00:30:56,403
Kenneth knows
how to put trouble to good use.

244
00:31:01,745 --> 00:31:03,235
I am empty.

245
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:08,497
- You have family?
- Both parents, still going strong.

246
00:31:08,498 --> 00:31:09,824
Teachers.

247
00:31:09,825 --> 00:31:13,503
Two brothers and a rather adorable niece.

248
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:14,955
Whiskey.

249
00:31:16,843 --> 00:31:19,800
- They know what you do?
- No.

250
00:31:19,801 --> 00:31:21,548
I can never lie to my dad.

251
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:23,095
Then he must worry about you.

252
00:31:23,096 --> 00:31:24,923
I tell him not to.

253
00:31:27,729 --> 00:31:29,719
Still keeping tabs?

254
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,976
I hate babysitting jobs.

255
00:31:36,363 --> 00:31:38,353
That guy just recognized me.

256
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,985
- Who?
- Gray shirt, gray tie, goatee.

257
00:31:45,372 --> 00:31:47,202
- You sure?
- Yeah.

258
00:31:47,203 --> 00:31:48,449
Why would he know you?

259
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:53,080
Because the last time I saw him,
I was in Baghdad in my hotel room.

260
00:31:53,081 --> 00:31:55,753
All right. Here comes our friend.

261
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,626
Well, it's obvious you're newlyweds.

262
00:32:01,627 --> 00:32:04,132
Still talking to each other
instead of the other guests.

263
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:06,589
- I am sorry. Are we being rude?
- No, no.

264
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:09,050
- Katie, Eric Studer.
- Hi.

265
00:32:09,051 --> 00:32:13,480
Listen, I had some brainwave.
What are you two doing afterwards?

266
00:32:13,692 --> 00:32:16,149
Well, I don't know.
You're jet-lagged, right?

267
00:32:16,778 --> 00:32:19,393
No, I am sorry.
I mean tomorrow, this week.

268
00:32:19,394 --> 00:32:20,853
No particular plans.

269
00:32:20,854 --> 00:32:23,915
- We were going back to London.
- London?

270
00:32:25,912 --> 00:32:27,072
I may have better than this.

271
00:32:27,831 --> 00:32:29,366
We're going to Saint Moritz.

272
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:31,539
- "We"?
- Yeah, some friends.

273
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,583
It will be fun. We will fly in,
put you up at a Suvretta.

274
00:32:34,584 --> 00:32:36,661
- Well..
- Do you ski?

275
00:32:36,662 --> 00:32:39,747
Snowboard.
These are the Alps, they're pretty steep.

276
00:32:39,748 --> 00:32:41,958
Like the prices. We will discuss it.

277
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:44,384
No, no, no discussion. We go.

278
00:32:44,385 --> 00:32:46,009
I will send the itinerary to your hotel.

279
00:32:47,017 --> 00:32:48,427
Wheels up at 11:00.

280
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,635
Okay? Okay?

281
00:32:56,776 --> 00:33:00,143
You locate Goatee. I will take Studer.

282
00:33:05,368 --> 00:33:07,949
Myself and a few friends
are heading to a nice little village.

283
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,827
Maybe you could come and join us.

284
00:33:10,248 --> 00:33:11,453
- Sounds good.
- Yeah?

285
00:33:11,454 --> 00:33:13,873
Bet you look good in white.
Fluffy, little bunny.

286
00:34:21,444 --> 00:34:23,856
I should think Sunday.

287
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,609
Sunday?

288
00:34:30,078 --> 00:34:33,616
Maybe Saturday, if we're lucky.

289
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,200
Then let's be lucky.

290
00:35:02,027 --> 00:35:04,062
- Mrs. Hillier.
- Hi Katie.

291
00:35:04,063 --> 00:35:06,769
Katie.
You haven't promised to come skiing.

292
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:09,401
I can't even find my way around here.

293
00:35:09,402 --> 00:35:12,073
Richard is in the other room.
I just left him.

294
00:35:12,074 --> 00:35:15,244
Well, actually, I was looking for the..

295
00:35:15,245 --> 00:35:19,165
They're in the back of the library.

296
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:20,741
So much wine.

297
00:35:20,742 --> 00:35:23,578
- So much to look at.
- Yeah.

298
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:27,415
You have only seen the inside.
I should show you the maze.

299
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,591
Isn't it a little dark out there?

300
00:35:29,592 --> 00:35:31,088
Perfect time.

301
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:33,421
I get claustrophobic, even in the daytime.

302
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:37,679
No, the whole point is to relax
and lose yourself.

303
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,010
I will take a rain check.

304
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,391
This is Ireland. Won't be long.

305
00:35:43,777 --> 00:35:46,814
And to find your way back,
retrace your steps.

306
00:37:04,941 --> 00:37:05,930
Fuck.

307
00:37:44,898 --> 00:37:45,648
Hi.

308
00:37:46,566 --> 00:37:49,307
- Where are you?
- In the bathroom.

309
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,733
I am not used to drinking so much.

310
00:37:51,734 --> 00:37:55,404
My friend from Baghdad has a date.
Well, a couple, actually.

311
00:37:55,405 --> 00:37:57,777
I think it's the paid-for kind.

312
00:37:57,778 --> 00:37:59,654
Where are you?

313
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:01,610
In the main room.

314
00:38:01,611 --> 00:38:04,071
I spoke to Studer briefly
and made our apologies,

315
00:38:04,072 --> 00:38:06,249
told him we'd discuss Saint Moritz
in the morning.

316
00:38:07,837 --> 00:38:10,954
I think we should get back to the hotel
and talk to Kenneth, don't you?

317
00:39:06,938 --> 00:39:08,053
Thank you.

318
00:40:41,741 --> 00:40:43,902
Mallory, you're in way over your head.

319
00:40:44,744 --> 00:40:45,778
Think this through.

320
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:48,611
You have been out of control
since you have arrived.

321
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,162
You need to call Kenneth.

322
00:43:05,802 --> 00:43:08,009
Excuse me. I should take this.

323
00:43:09,138 --> 00:43:10,469
Pauly?

324
00:43:11,974 --> 00:43:14,966
So, is the divorce final?

325
00:43:17,647 --> 00:43:19,262
Paul, are you there?

326
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,355
Mallory.

327
00:43:42,672 --> 00:43:45,333
- Hello.
- Dad, it's Mal.

328
00:43:45,334 --> 00:43:49,132
Things are kind of screwed up here
and I need to come home.

329
00:43:49,133 --> 00:43:52,928
It may take me a couple of days,
depending on what happens.

330
00:43:52,929 --> 00:43:55,506
Don't worry about me,
you just get here as quick as you can.

331
00:43:55,852 --> 00:43:58,092
I will try.

332
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,176
Keep your eyes open.

333
00:44:00,356 --> 00:44:03,188
I haven't shut my eyes since you were born.

334
00:44:03,189 --> 00:44:04,265
Just be careful.

335
00:44:05,236 --> 00:44:07,022
And watch your six.

336
00:44:08,781 --> 00:44:10,691
I will.

337
00:44:10,692 --> 00:44:12,148
I will see you at the house.

338
00:48:18,614 --> 00:48:21,651
- Can I get this cell phone?
- It's 42.50.

339
00:48:27,581 --> 00:48:29,037
There you go.

340
00:53:50,946 --> 00:53:54,859
Come on, let's go, let's go.
Get over there. Let's go. Come on.

341
00:54:32,613 --> 00:54:35,445
Rodrigo. Hi, it's Mallory Kane.

342
00:54:35,446 --> 00:54:37,567
- Mallory Kane.
- I hope it's not too late.

343
00:54:37,568 --> 00:54:39,990
I just landed in New York.
Do you have a minute?

344
00:54:39,991 --> 00:54:42,614
I just felt like I had to call.
I was going over my report,

345
00:54:42,615 --> 00:54:46,493
and I realized
I never thanked you for all your help.

346
00:54:46,494 --> 00:54:51,544
It's really not necessary.
It's not even customary.

347
00:54:51,545 --> 00:54:52,712
Well, it should be.

348
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:57,043
But I just wanted to verify one thing
with you before I actually file my report.

349
00:54:57,513 --> 00:55:02,132
Was it you or Kenneth
who sold the Barcelona job to Studer?

350
00:55:47,312 --> 00:55:49,397
Rodrigo. Que paso?

351
00:55:49,398 --> 00:55:52,480
What are you working so late for?
It's what, past 8:00, your time?

352
00:55:52,481 --> 00:55:55,810
Yeah. Listen, Mallory Kane just called me.

353
00:55:56,905 --> 00:55:58,941
I thought you should know.

354
00:56:00,909 --> 00:56:03,195
- Wait, she called you at home?
- Yes.

355
00:56:05,163 --> 00:56:07,154
Was that a nice conversation?

356
00:56:07,749 --> 00:56:12,209
Yeah, yeah, very nice.
Brief, but very nice. Yeah.

357
00:56:12,754 --> 00:56:15,211
She thanked me for my assistance.

358
00:56:17,009 --> 00:56:19,215
She still in Dublin?

359
00:56:19,216 --> 00:56:21,839
She said she just landed in New York.

360
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,669
Good.

361
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:28,306
Good. Well,
why don't you stay off your house line,

362
00:56:28,307 --> 00:56:33,055
and I wouldn't go outside
till I call you back.

363
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,140
Or your family.

364
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:37,225
- I see. Thank you.
- All right.

365
00:56:37,226 --> 00:56:39,026
Rodrigo, you take care, all right?

366
00:56:39,027 --> 00:56:40,854
Yeah, sure. Bye.

367
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:55,122
Tyler, the activity log
for the number that I just sent you,

368
00:56:55,123 --> 00:56:59,297
I want you to connect me
to the last incoming call.

369
00:57:06,266 --> 00:57:07,255
Who is this?

370
00:57:07,517 --> 00:57:10,178
Mallory, hi. My name is Alex Coblenz.

371
00:57:10,179 --> 00:57:15,059
I was with Kenneth and Rodrigo
when the Barcelona deal went down.

372
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,606
Who else besides you knows about this?

373
00:57:17,607 --> 00:57:21,561
No, only the people
that need to know in order to fix it.

374
00:57:21,562 --> 00:57:23,772
The people who thought up Barcelona.

375
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:26,448
Mallory, we did not think up Barcelona.

376
00:57:26,449 --> 00:57:29,402
No, you just helped.

377
00:57:29,403 --> 00:57:31,909
- Can you bring me in?
- We can, yes,

378
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:35,332
but I'd like you
to keep doing what you're doing.

379
00:57:35,333 --> 00:57:40,163
We want you to bust Kenneth's budget,
you know, see how he reacts.

380
00:57:40,164 --> 00:57:43,670
Everyone he reaches out to,
you know, it's like another layer.

381
00:57:43,671 --> 00:57:45,592
What do you think he's into?

382
00:57:45,593 --> 00:57:48,593
Well, whatever it is,
Kenneth is not at the top.

383
00:57:49,309 --> 00:57:54,428
It's just not possible. We like Studer.
We think there's something there.

384
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,559
You got to get me off the watch list.

385
00:57:56,817 --> 00:57:58,852
Mallory, I cannot do that.

386
00:57:58,853 --> 00:58:01,026
You know, while Kenneth's watching,
he will know we spoke.

387
00:58:02,864 --> 00:58:07,448
I promise I will do everything I can
to convince him to meet you.

388
00:58:07,449 --> 00:58:09,651
Then you can find out
what we both want to know,

389
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:12,453
which is why this is happening.

390
00:58:14,668 --> 00:58:17,249
I got a fake ID in London,
came in through Canada,

391
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:19,247
and crossed the border.

392
00:58:19,248 --> 00:58:23,627
Coblenz helped me set up a meeting
with Kenneth, but Aaron showed up instead.

393
00:58:23,628 --> 00:58:25,459
And then I met you.

394
00:58:27,764 --> 00:58:29,924
There's some water in my backpack.

395
00:58:29,925 --> 00:58:31,382
Have some.

396
00:58:33,895 --> 00:58:36,227
Don't mind if I do. Thank you.

397
00:58:38,567 --> 00:58:41,353
- You want some?
- Yeah, please.

398
00:58:41,354 --> 00:58:43,731
- Help me.
- Yeah, sorry.

399
00:58:45,657 --> 00:58:47,739
- Good?
- Yeah. Thanks.

400
00:58:57,586 --> 00:59:00,042
What's going on here?

401
00:59:00,043 --> 00:59:01,836
Random road check?

402
00:59:03,425 --> 00:59:05,461
All right. Hold on.

403
00:59:17,297 --> 00:59:18,286
Yep.

404
00:59:31,953 --> 00:59:33,113
Jesus.

405
00:59:39,211 --> 00:59:40,200
Jeez.

406
00:59:46,802 --> 00:59:49,133
I just got this car,
like, a week ago.

407
00:59:49,134 --> 00:59:50,336
Yeah, well..

408
01:00:02,109 --> 01:00:03,724
Whoops, more LEOs.

409
01:00:05,237 --> 01:00:06,693
What's a LEO?

410
01:00:07,906 --> 01:00:09,988
Law enforcement officers.

411
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:31,925
Shit.

412
01:00:31,926 --> 01:00:33,844
Shit. Watch the car.

413
01:00:40,981 --> 01:00:43,562
That was nice. That was nice.
That was really bad.

414
01:00:43,563 --> 01:00:44,934
I thought that was going to be
really bad for a second.

415
01:00:44,935 --> 01:00:46,981
I thought I was going to have
a heart attack. Oh, my God.

416
01:00:46,982 --> 01:00:49,903
Jesus Christ.
You are a great driver.

417
01:00:59,624 --> 01:01:00,954
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, are you?

418
01:01:00,955 --> 01:01:03,874
Yeah. Oh, my God.
There's a deer in the car.

419
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:05,793
- Jesus..
- Yeah, I know.

420
01:01:13,471 --> 01:01:15,802
- Should we run?
- No. Don't.

421
01:01:15,803 --> 01:01:17,552
We have done enough.

422
01:01:25,066 --> 01:01:26,726
Show me your hands.

423
01:01:26,727 --> 01:01:30,059
- Freeze. Don't move.
- You, behind the car, step forward.

424
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:32,736
Hands in the air. Turn around.

425
01:01:32,737 --> 01:01:33,859
Turn around, punk.

426
01:01:39,414 --> 01:01:41,325
Unit three.

427
01:01:42,292 --> 01:01:43,656
Unit three.

428
01:01:43,657 --> 01:01:48,666
Proceed with suspects to 2345 Clearview.

429
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:53,045
Repeat, 2345 Clearview, and hold.

430
01:01:53,046 --> 01:01:56,127
Federal agents en route.

431
01:01:56,128 --> 01:01:57,712
Unit three, copy.

432
01:01:57,713 --> 01:02:00,843
You must have stepped in something.

433
01:02:00,844 --> 01:02:02,267
Yeah.

434
01:02:04,231 --> 01:02:06,687
Excuse me, Deputy Cross?

435
01:02:06,688 --> 01:02:08,730
Deputy Cross? Hi.

436
01:02:08,731 --> 01:02:12,105
You were in the Corps, right?
I was a devil dog.

437
01:02:12,106 --> 01:02:15,438
Listen, this might sound a little funny.

438
01:02:15,439 --> 01:02:18,194
I am a private contractor
on a 10-24 operation,

439
01:02:18,195 --> 01:02:20,572
and these guys you're about to meet
are not federal agents.

440
01:02:21,414 --> 01:02:23,404
I mean, follow your protocol and all,

441
01:02:23,405 --> 01:02:25,364
but you should really keep your distance.

442
01:02:25,365 --> 01:02:29,748
Use your radio and your loudspeakers
in order to confirm who these guys aren't.

443
01:02:29,749 --> 01:02:31,544
Really, I am not joking.

444
01:02:31,545 --> 01:02:34,965
You can look me up,
a New Mexico license for Mallory Kane.

445
01:02:34,966 --> 01:02:36,883
I will confirm the number.

446
01:02:36,884 --> 01:02:39,007
You need to sit back.

447
01:02:39,008 --> 01:02:42,386
Look, an innocent civilian will be
killed if you do not listen to me. Hey.

448
01:02:42,387 --> 01:02:45,844
Wonder Woman, you said your piece.
Now sit back and shut up.

449
01:03:49,044 --> 01:03:51,251
- Jesus, are you..
- Get down.

450
01:04:01,389 --> 01:04:04,425
Just keep your head down
a few more minutes and you're out of this.

451
01:04:04,426 --> 01:04:07,758
Great, great. How are you going to
get out of this, may I ask?

452
01:04:07,759 --> 01:04:11,061
I will just dump the car. I will find
another ride. I will catch a bus.

453
01:04:11,062 --> 01:04:12,729
Great, good luck with that.

454
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:14,898
I can't wait till Coblenz hears about this.

455
01:04:14,899 --> 01:04:17,226
- What is that?
- Listen, when we split,

456
01:04:17,227 --> 01:04:19,186
I am going to give you a number to call.

457
01:04:19,187 --> 01:04:22,489
I was supposed to be
sleeping in late today,

458
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:24,441
not getting carjacked.

459
01:04:24,442 --> 01:04:25,867
Scott, you still with me?

460
01:04:25,868 --> 01:04:29,242
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, a number.
- Just tell them everything.

461
01:04:29,243 --> 01:04:32,370
Tell the police, too, tell them
everything I have told you, okay?

462
01:04:32,371 --> 01:04:34,326
- Yeah, okay.
- You did great.

463
01:04:34,327 --> 01:04:36,913
- You're going to be fine.
- Yeah. Okay.

464
01:04:37,842 --> 01:04:41,083
This is the trouble
with the private sector, Kenneth.

465
01:04:41,084 --> 01:04:44,420
You got that macho takedown,
but where's the due diligence?

466
01:04:44,421 --> 01:04:45,756
Where's the follow-through?

467
01:04:47,394 --> 01:04:50,556
Now, we got ourselves
a real twizzler here.

468
01:04:50,557 --> 01:04:53,349
And for eight figures,
I don't accept excuses,

469
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:56,523
explanations or rationales.

470
01:04:56,524 --> 01:04:59,067
Now I don't even know
why the hell you're standing here.

471
01:04:59,068 --> 01:05:02,442
You should be in her father's living
room, explaining to him,

472
01:05:02,443 --> 01:05:06,617
telling him that his daughter
is a fugitive with ties to terrorists.

473
01:05:06,618 --> 01:05:09,912
That she killed a man in cold blood
in Dublin and killed four cops.

474
01:05:11,292 --> 01:05:12,782
You tell him.

475
01:05:13,837 --> 01:05:15,122
Show him.

476
01:05:16,464 --> 01:05:19,752
He will come at you like he's government,
make me seem like a monster.

477
01:05:20,718 --> 01:05:23,208
Play like you're shocked.

478
01:05:23,209 --> 01:05:26,090
The guy with the broken arm, Aaron,

479
01:05:26,091 --> 01:05:27,341
get in his head.

480
01:05:27,342 --> 01:05:29,515
Keep bringing up Barcelona.

481
01:05:29,516 --> 01:05:31,808
Get him arguing with Kenneth.

482
01:05:31,809 --> 01:05:33,886
Kenneth.

483
01:05:33,887 --> 01:05:37,565
My fault. I should have
seen that one coming.

484
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:39,733
You did.

485
01:05:39,734 --> 01:05:44,063
Hold up a sec, Mal.
Let's analyze your options.

486
01:05:44,064 --> 01:05:46,490
We could leave right now, disappear.

487
01:05:46,491 --> 01:05:49,661
We could be in Buenos Aires
this time tomorrow.

488
01:05:52,834 --> 01:05:54,870
I am not going to run anymore.

489
01:05:58,381 --> 01:06:02,420
Mr. Kane, these were taken by the police.
They're pretty graphic.

490
01:06:04,596 --> 01:06:06,927
Her prints are all over the room.

491
01:06:06,928 --> 01:06:10,723
The security video shows them
coming in together and her leaving alone.

492
01:06:10,724 --> 01:06:14,472
The guest downstairs
complained about the noise.

493
01:06:14,473 --> 01:06:16,269
Paul fought back,

494
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:18,688
but she obviously had
the element of surprise in her favor.

495
01:06:18,689 --> 01:06:22,018
She choked him out
and she shot him in the head.

496
01:06:23,698 --> 01:06:27,737
Add that to the four police,
and that is five dead in three days.

497
01:06:28,453 --> 01:06:32,161
- Where was she last seen?
- Upstate New York, 36 hours ago.

498
01:06:32,162 --> 01:06:35,660
- Was she alone?
- No, she was with a boy, 19.

499
01:06:35,661 --> 01:06:38,493
She grabbed him at gunpoint.
Used him as a ride and a shield,

500
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:41,455
so we can add aggravated kidnapping
to the murder charges.

501
01:06:43,843 --> 01:06:45,003
No, I am sorry.

502
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:48,424
This doesn't sound like my daughter.

503
01:06:51,392 --> 01:06:54,053
She ever mention the name Kenneth?

504
01:06:54,054 --> 01:06:54,804
No.

505
01:06:56,397 --> 01:06:58,136
Really?

506
01:06:58,137 --> 01:07:00,689
He runs the company she worked for.

507
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:02,764
They were in a relationship
for over a year,

508
01:07:02,777 --> 01:07:04,861
and yet she never
mentioned him to you?

509
01:07:06,241 --> 01:07:07,651
What do you know about her?

510
01:07:08,201 --> 01:07:09,987
Really, at the end of the day?

511
01:07:10,703 --> 01:07:11,692
I raised her.

512
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:14,821
And denial is a very
effective parenting tool.

513
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:17,907
She was a Marine. She does something,
there must be a reason for it.

514
01:07:17,908 --> 01:07:21,664
Mr. Kane, she is no longer a Marine.
She is a murderer.

515
01:07:21,665 --> 01:07:24,293
She is a public threat.
She's on a killing spree.

516
01:07:25,718 --> 01:07:28,709
Now, you are the only person
that she can trust.

517
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:31,090
You're going to help bring her in
before she kills again.

518
01:07:31,091 --> 01:07:33,764
Without you, she won't survive this.

519
01:07:45,154 --> 01:07:46,940
I heard from her.

520
01:07:48,616 --> 01:07:49,605
Ten days ago.

521
01:07:50,285 --> 01:07:53,196
She texted me,
said she was going to Barcelona.

522
01:07:53,197 --> 01:07:55,824
What did she say exactly?

523
01:07:55,825 --> 01:07:58,781
"Going to Barcelona. Call you after."

524
01:07:58,782 --> 01:08:00,866
Six words, that's it?

525
01:08:00,867 --> 01:08:02,417
Well, it was enough for me.

526
01:08:02,418 --> 01:08:05,041
And she didn't mention Dublin?
She didn't say anything about this?

527
01:08:05,042 --> 01:08:06,213
No.

528
01:08:09,137 --> 01:08:10,717
Who was he?

529
01:08:10,718 --> 01:08:13,672
He was an agent with British Intelligence.

530
01:08:14,642 --> 01:08:18,600
Now, whether this was a murder-for-hire
or a crime of passion, we don't know.

531
01:08:18,601 --> 01:08:20,143
Well, she would never kill someone
for money.

532
01:08:20,144 --> 01:08:21,436
There must be an explanation.

533
01:08:21,437 --> 01:08:24,356
Didn't this all start after Barcelona?

534
01:08:24,357 --> 01:08:26,729
Maybe that has something to do
with why she's a fugitive.

535
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:28,561
Something must have happened there.

536
01:08:29,490 --> 01:08:31,230
- Aaron.
- I am on it.

537
01:08:38,583 --> 01:08:41,745
It's overseas. Prepaid phone.
Yeah, that's got to be her.

538
01:08:41,746 --> 01:08:43,667
Wait for the track.

539
01:08:44,672 --> 01:08:45,751
Go.

540
01:08:45,752 --> 01:08:47,250
Talk to her.

541
01:08:50,345 --> 01:08:51,834
Mallory.

542
01:08:51,835 --> 01:08:55,046
Dad, don't say anything.
Give Kenneth the phone.

543
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:58,887
Just be careful.

544
01:09:07,779 --> 01:09:11,270
Mallory, I hope you have decided
to turn yourself in.

545
01:09:11,271 --> 01:09:13,606
You can tell me right now
why you sold me out

546
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:15,315
and what you're into with Studer,

547
01:09:15,316 --> 01:09:16,900
or you can tell me in ten minutes,

548
01:09:16,901 --> 01:09:19,703
when I have my hands around your throat.

549
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:22,243
You need to think for a minute, Mallory.

550
01:09:22,244 --> 01:09:23,619
You need to stop pretending

551
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:26,327
you can achieve a desirable outcome
in this situation,

552
01:09:26,673 --> 01:09:29,129
and turn yourself in.

553
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:31,832
Do it for the sake of your father.

554
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:33,667
Surrender now if you want to live.

555
01:09:33,668 --> 01:09:36,469
I am sorry, Mallory, that's not possible.

556
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:38,672
All right, Kenneth.
We will do it your way.

557
01:09:38,673 --> 01:09:40,803
She's..

558
01:09:40,804 --> 01:09:42,135
She's here.

559
01:09:42,397 --> 01:09:43,385
Here? Where?

560
01:09:43,386 --> 01:09:46,980
In the house. Track says she's in
the house. Go, now. You sit down.

561
01:09:46,981 --> 01:09:48,728
You knew about this?
You knew she was here?

562
01:09:48,729 --> 01:09:53,529
No. I told you, I haven't heard
from her since she texted me.

563
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:54,901
Kenny.

564
01:09:57,912 --> 01:09:59,993
Do we need to have a conversation
about Barcelona?

565
01:09:59,994 --> 01:10:01,866
Aaron, you were in Barcelona.
You know what happened.

566
01:10:01,867 --> 01:10:03,367
We rescued a man.

567
01:10:03,368 --> 01:10:06,370
- Did we?
- Aaron, you need to focus right now.

568
01:10:06,371 --> 01:10:08,327
You were in Barcelona?

569
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:12,457
I am confused.
She works for a private company.

570
01:10:17,473 --> 01:10:19,758
Breaker box. Get on it. Lock the doors.

571
01:10:19,759 --> 01:10:22,341
- What if she's inside?
- Then we will pressure-cook her.

572
01:10:22,342 --> 01:10:23,676
We will find her.

573
01:10:23,677 --> 01:10:25,010
I don't mean to tell you your job,

574
01:10:25,011 --> 01:10:28,313
but isn't there someone
you should be calling, Agent Milgrom?

575
01:10:28,314 --> 01:10:31,142
Other officers of the law, to bring help?

576
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:33,102
We can handle this.

577
01:10:33,448 --> 01:10:35,063
- Go.
- I got this. Watch him.

578
01:11:16,365 --> 01:11:17,604
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

579
01:11:17,605 --> 01:11:19,031
Get on it.

580
01:11:26,501 --> 01:11:28,991
Tom's down. IED in the breaker box.

581
01:11:28,992 --> 01:11:30,996
- We need to get to the car.
- I am not sure if that will help.

582
01:11:30,997 --> 01:11:32,203
But she can't outrun a car.

583
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:33,999
She can if it's not running.

584
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,626
Well, then let's find out.

585
01:11:35,627 --> 01:11:37,713
Be my guest. Go ahead.

586
01:11:41,557 --> 01:11:43,388
You should see this.

587
01:11:45,853 --> 01:11:48,014
Who did that? Her?

588
01:11:48,731 --> 01:11:50,971
- Yeah, probably. That's why we're here.
- Doesn't make any sense, man.

589
01:11:50,972 --> 01:11:52,236
Aaron, let's not discuss
this right now. No.

590
01:11:52,249 --> 01:11:53,523
We're going to talk about it.
Calm down.

591
01:11:53,524 --> 01:11:54,725
Don't tell me to calm down.

592
01:11:54,726 --> 01:11:56,902
- What did you do?
- I did what I was contracted to do.

593
01:11:56,903 --> 01:11:58,570
We were contracted to rescue somebody.

594
01:11:59,158 --> 01:12:00,988
It seems to me, you auctioned him
off and tried to burn her.

595
01:12:00,989 --> 01:12:02,441
- That's not what happened.
- Really?

596
01:12:02,442 --> 01:12:03,867
- No, I can explain.
- Then explain it,

597
01:12:03,868 --> 01:12:05,536
and try really hard.

598
01:12:12,046 --> 01:12:14,082
Don't give me a reason.

599
01:12:34,735 --> 01:12:36,566
No, just go help her.

600
01:12:57,550 --> 01:12:59,381
- Kenneth.
- He's gone.

601
01:13:34,712 --> 01:13:36,327
You better run.

602
01:14:00,029 --> 01:14:01,690
I am so stupid.

603
01:14:11,165 --> 01:14:14,577
Can't believe I met you a week ago.

604
01:14:14,578 --> 01:14:16,660
Eight, eight days.

605
01:14:19,757 --> 01:14:22,373
We were in Barcelona eight days ago?

606
01:14:26,347 --> 01:14:29,009
I am trying to focus on my breathing.

607
01:15:28,743 --> 01:15:29,732
Mal?

608
01:15:31,912 --> 01:15:33,072
Mal?

609
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:37,073
Sweetheart?

610
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:50,795
It's okay.

611
01:16:33,849 --> 01:16:35,930
In the auction business,
they have an expression

612
01:16:35,931 --> 01:16:38,633
called "the halo effect."

613
01:16:38,634 --> 01:16:40,765
You know what that is?

614
01:16:40,981 --> 01:16:44,347
It's when an object or work of art
is more desirable

615
01:16:44,348 --> 01:16:46,684
because of its prior ownership.

616
01:16:48,739 --> 01:16:52,197
Very rare when it happens, you know?
Maybe once in a lifetime.

617
01:16:53,369 --> 01:16:55,485
Got to catch it when you can.

618
01:16:58,999 --> 01:17:02,035
Look, I got plenty of
drama in my own office.

619
01:17:02,036 --> 01:17:03,833
You were his contact.

620
01:17:03,834 --> 01:17:06,081
No, I was his employer.

621
01:17:06,082 --> 01:17:08,504
There's a very big difference, trust me.

622
01:17:08,505 --> 01:17:10,081
There's only one person I trust.

623
01:17:10,082 --> 01:17:12,588
Your dad, yes. He okay?

624
01:17:12,589 --> 01:17:16,012
He's fine. Thanks for cleaning up.

625
01:17:16,013 --> 01:17:21,344
Well, I told you you can have Kenneth
alone at the house. I promised you that.

626
01:17:21,345 --> 01:17:24,600
It should at least make me a colleague,

627
01:17:24,601 --> 01:17:26,727
if not a friend.

628
01:17:26,728 --> 01:17:29,184
And if something happens to you?

629
01:17:29,185 --> 01:17:31,110
Well, then you're screwed.

630
01:17:31,111 --> 01:17:32,983
One friend's not a lot.

631
01:17:32,984 --> 01:17:35,690
It depends on who it is.

632
01:17:35,691 --> 01:17:39,574
- And the kid who helped me?
- We will fix the ding in his car.

633
01:17:40,875 --> 01:17:43,742
Okay, I will buy him a new car.

634
01:17:44,879 --> 01:17:47,211
What is that, an incentive?

635
01:17:48,591 --> 01:17:50,376
It could be.

636
01:17:50,377 --> 01:17:51,956
You got to admit

637
01:17:51,957 --> 01:17:54,667
that this type of life appeals
to a certain kind of person.

638
01:17:54,668 --> 01:17:58,847
You know? You're off the grid,
you never answer to anybody.

639
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:02,392
Always looking over your shoulder.

640
01:18:03,397 --> 01:18:07,731
And you got Kenneth out there
with all his contacts.

641
01:18:08,861 --> 01:18:10,817
Makes you pretty vulnerable.

642
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:13,020
Where is he?

643
01:18:13,949 --> 01:18:18,409
Well, Mallory, that is a valuable piece
of information, isn't it?

644
01:18:20,539 --> 01:18:22,745
We think he's crossed the border.

645
01:18:22,746 --> 01:18:25,370
Possible sightings in Veracruz.

646
01:18:26,086 --> 01:18:30,250
But what would be nice to know
is what he gave everything up for.

647
01:18:33,302 --> 01:18:36,168
So we're back to the government option.

648
01:18:36,169 --> 01:18:39,129
Pays less, taxes are taken out.

649
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:41,967
But you get your good name back.

650
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:53,560
I will let you know.

651
01:18:55,366 --> 01:18:57,482
- When?
- When I have him.

652
01:19:28,649 --> 01:19:29,889
Yes?

653
01:19:31,318 --> 01:19:32,307
Kenneth.

654
01:19:37,032 --> 01:19:38,772
He's not available.

655
01:19:58,595 --> 01:20:00,255
I am good.

656
01:20:00,256 --> 01:20:02,212
Just going for a walk.

657
01:21:57,464 --> 01:21:58,624
Fuck.

658
01:22:02,803 --> 01:22:04,508
Who did I extract in Barcelona?

659
01:22:04,509 --> 01:22:07,178
You mean who did you kill in Dublin?

660
01:22:07,933 --> 01:22:09,639
Tide's coming in.

661
01:22:11,103 --> 01:22:12,809
It was a journalist, a dissident.

662
01:22:13,814 --> 01:22:16,555
A dissident journalist,
a scientist, what does it matter?

663
01:22:16,556 --> 01:22:18,390
It mattered to someone. Who?

664
01:22:20,612 --> 01:22:24,104
You were excited on the phone.
What do you have?

665
01:22:25,033 --> 01:22:27,695
A unique alignment of conditions.

666
01:22:29,663 --> 01:22:33,405
I know this man, Jiang,
has been a problem for you,

667
01:22:33,406 --> 01:22:36,616
leaking information and so forth.

668
01:22:36,617 --> 01:22:38,794
Restricting your movements.

669
01:22:40,257 --> 01:22:43,589
I also know this Kane girl
is about to leave her employer

670
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:46,668
and take all his business with her.

671
01:22:46,669 --> 01:22:49,504
Which he won't survive.

672
01:22:49,505 --> 01:22:51,806
So when I get word that

673
01:22:51,807 --> 01:22:54,761
Jiang has been staying
in a safe house in Barcelona,

674
01:22:56,148 --> 01:22:59,510
I see an opportunity for everyone to

675
01:23:00,611 --> 01:23:03,023
transcend their circumstances.

676
01:23:05,115 --> 01:23:09,608
You mean hire the girl to rescue Jiang?

677
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:12,910
And I deliver him to you.

678
01:23:12,911 --> 01:23:15,034
The story will be that she's gone rogue.

679
01:23:15,375 --> 01:23:16,784
Sold out on the Barcelona job

680
01:23:16,785 --> 01:23:18,959
and murdered a man
for money at Russborough.

681
01:23:20,047 --> 01:23:21,456
Resistance?

682
01:23:21,457 --> 01:23:23,458
He won't be in a position to.

683
01:23:23,459 --> 01:23:24,959
Put a bullet in him,

684
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:28,135
plant the broach on him, and then kill her
when you get back to the hotel.

685
01:23:29,139 --> 01:23:31,221
- Self-defense.
- Of course.

686
01:23:35,312 --> 01:23:39,555
I am assuming the motive of everyone
involved is strictly professional?

687
01:23:42,069 --> 01:23:44,650
Paul, the motive is money.

688
01:23:44,651 --> 01:23:46,978
The motive is always money.

689
01:23:46,979 --> 01:23:49,815
What about Kenneth?
Can he guarantee delivery?

690
01:23:49,816 --> 01:23:51,992
It's a two-for-one deal.

691
01:23:52,246 --> 01:23:54,486
You take Jiang out,

692
01:23:54,487 --> 01:23:57,447
Kenneth takes the Kane girl out.

693
01:23:57,448 --> 01:23:59,658
To close the loop.

694
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:01,617
With no one looking.

695
01:24:01,618 --> 01:24:04,045
Yeah. You're right.

696
01:24:05,259 --> 01:24:06,464
She does sound perfect.

697
01:24:06,465 --> 01:24:08,759
You only have to look at her.

698
01:24:09,221 --> 01:24:10,210
What about the girl?

699
01:24:11,723 --> 01:24:14,009
- What about her?
- Can she handle herself?

700
01:24:15,727 --> 01:24:17,592
I am sure you will cope.

701
01:24:22,943 --> 01:24:25,309
I have never done a woman before.

702
01:24:26,405 --> 01:24:29,111
You shouldn't think of her
as being a woman.

703
01:24:29,112 --> 01:24:31,360
No, that would be a mistake.

704
01:24:32,953 --> 01:24:34,443
What's in this for you?

705
01:24:34,997 --> 01:24:36,703
Besides my money.

706
01:24:38,625 --> 01:24:40,035
A new life.

707
01:24:41,962 --> 01:24:43,498
And a new wife.

708
01:24:45,632 --> 01:24:48,589
That's everything I know.

709
01:24:48,590 --> 01:24:51,293
That's everything I know. That's it.

710
01:24:59,521 --> 01:25:02,481
- Mallory.
- Mallory.

711
01:25:05,444 --> 01:25:06,934
Mallory.

712
01:26:16,223 --> 01:26:17,212
Dianna.

713
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:39,405
Dianna.

714
01:27:00,392 --> 01:27:01,507
Shit.

715
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:06,000
