1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,041
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,449
Akbar, we would fight the tank with you.

5
00:00:10,061 --> 00:00:12,052
You have no weapons.

6
00:00:23,508 --> 00:00:26,306
Get back to the village, woman! Go!

7
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:51,923
Uncle...

8
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,130
...am I fit to be Khan?

9
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,831
To ask that question makes you Khan.

10
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,011
When The Beast is dead, we will return.

11
00:02:18,123 --> 00:02:19,886
I will be waiting.

12
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,144
There it is.

13
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:20,884
Kandahar Road.

14
00:03:31,529 --> 00:03:33,326
Kaminski, we're home.

15
00:03:40,738 --> 00:03:43,070
Sir, we're almost out of petrol.

16
00:03:43,575 --> 00:03:45,304
Make it to the road.

17
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:48,543
Stop tank.

18
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,807
. What?
. Stop tank.

19
00:03:51,382 --> 00:03:52,713
Stop tank.

20
00:04:01,793 --> 00:04:04,193
I'm sure I can make it, it's only...

21
00:05:50,602 --> 00:05:51,762
Please.

22
00:05:55,173 --> 00:05:56,231
Untie my hands.

23
00:05:56,307 --> 00:06:00,073
Afghan women, turn your grief to stone!

24
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:04,773
Stop.

25
00:06:11,923 --> 00:06:13,083
Jesus!

26
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:14,891
Please, stop!

27
00:06:16,494 --> 00:06:17,586
<i>Nanawatai!</i>

28
00:06:33,645 --> 00:06:35,272
Sherina, how did you find us?

29
00:06:35,613 --> 00:06:36,875
It was Allah's will...

30
00:06:36,948 --> 00:06:38,745
We found him tied to the rock.

31
00:06:40,518 --> 00:06:42,486
You take the honor, Taj.

32
00:06:42,854 --> 00:06:43,718
<i>Nanawatai.</i>

33
00:06:48,293 --> 00:06:49,225
<i>Nanawatai.</i>

34
00:06:49,394 --> 00:06:50,759
He asks for mercy.

35
00:06:51,496 --> 00:06:54,659
I teach you another word <i>...</i> Badal!
Blood for blood!

36
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:56,923
Silence, woman!

37
00:06:59,404 --> 00:07:00,530
You speak Afghan?

38
00:07:00,738 --> 00:07:01,602
<i>Nanawatai.</i>

39
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:04,772
What is your name?

40
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:06,775
<i>Nanawatai.</i>

41
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:08,636
A crow can speak a word,

42
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:12,141
...but a crow is not a man,
and neither is a Russian.

43
00:07:13,384 --> 00:07:14,681
Kill him!

44
00:07:15,753 --> 00:07:19,780
If we dishonor our code and slay him
we are no better than the infidels.

45
00:07:30,335 --> 00:07:33,133
...but why was he abandoned by the tank?

46
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:41,004
Don't.

47
00:07:41,446 --> 00:07:42,174
No.

48
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:23,986
Nanawatai is for Afghans.

49
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:27,615
If he is an enemy of our enemy,
then he is a friend.

50
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:29,926
Let us look to our guest.

51
00:09:03,594 --> 00:09:04,356
Eat.

52
00:09:04,595 --> 00:09:05,755
Choke.

53
00:09:52,643 --> 00:09:54,804
You broke it when you dropped it.

54
00:09:55,613 --> 00:09:59,105
So? David took Goliath with just a stone.

55
00:10:22,874 --> 00:10:24,398
An RPG.

56
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:32,981
It's kaput.

57
00:10:43,961 --> 00:10:45,019
Fix.

58
00:10:47,598 --> 00:10:48,895
I fix.

59
00:11:10,354 --> 00:11:11,480
Kaput.

60
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,388
Enfield.

61
00:11:19,997 --> 00:11:22,488
I need Enfield to fix the RPG.

62
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:32,236
Thanks.

63
00:12:00,771 --> 00:12:03,934
Now he has ruined two of our weapons!

64
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:52,914
This one is truly sent from Allah!

65
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:06,593
Exactly.

66
00:13:21,185 --> 00:13:22,652
That's a tank.

67
00:13:23,087 --> 00:13:24,179
Tank.

68
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,314
Tank.

69
00:13:27,124 --> 00:13:28,113
RPG.

70
00:13:31,696 --> 00:13:32,526
Tank.

71
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:38,059
RPG, kaboom tank.

72
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:45,165
RPG...

73
00:13:46,077 --> 00:13:47,237
...kaboom...

74
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:48,635
...tank.

75
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:52,471
He's Russian!

76
00:13:53,184 --> 00:13:54,811
He knows how to use that...

77
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:58,146
...and they tried to kill him.

78
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,956
Kaboom tank.

79
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:43,224
Yeah, I'll kaboom tank.

80
00:15:46,564 --> 00:15:47,553
Come on, man.

81
00:15:47,898 --> 00:15:50,423
Come on, get your shit. Let's go.

82
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,512
Hey, you guys.

83
00:16:08,986 --> 00:16:10,715
Where'd you guys come from?

84
00:16:11,822 --> 00:16:13,289
This is beautiful.

85
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:15,555
We are so glad to see you guys.

86
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:17,024
My God.

87
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:28,035
Looks like it's your lucky day.

88
00:16:28,205 --> 00:16:31,606
If we hadn't been looking for water,
we'd have never found you.

89
00:16:31,675 --> 00:16:35,441
Go ahead and climb aboard.
I'll call in for a strike on the tank.

90
00:16:37,214 --> 00:16:39,375
Nobody wastes my tank.

91
00:16:50,694 --> 00:16:51,991
Get back in the tank.

92
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:54,594
What for?

93
00:16:55,366 --> 00:16:56,833
Because I said so.

94
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:00,468
We're going home, sir.

95
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:03,835
In the tank.

96
00:17:05,175 --> 00:17:08,736
Why can't we go home
in the fucking helicopter?

97
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,541
Because you're tankers.

98
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:15,183
You're also in a cul. De. Sac.

99
00:17:19,823 --> 00:17:22,053
There's only one way out of this valley.

100
00:17:22,226 --> 00:17:24,387
Back through that pass.

101
00:17:54,591 --> 00:17:56,559
We'll get back the same way we got in.

102
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,849
Shit.

103
00:18:02,232 --> 00:18:04,700
. Got any extra water?
. No.

104
00:18:04,902 --> 00:18:07,996
You two, load the extra fuel onto the tank.

105
00:18:08,072 --> 00:18:11,166
Radio for some more fuel
to meet us at the pass.

106
00:18:13,143 --> 00:18:14,838
Jesus, what an asshole.

107
00:18:50,948 --> 00:18:52,506
What are we doing?

108
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,675
Why don't we make a run for it?

109
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:57,918
Are you fucking crazy?

110
00:18:58,288 --> 00:19:00,654
He'd shoot us right out of the sky.

111
00:20:01,318 --> 00:20:03,479
The tank is leaving!

112
00:20:04,755 --> 00:20:06,950
The pass... The pass!

113
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:10,124
It's turning back for the pass!

114
00:20:12,196 --> 00:20:12,958
What?

115
00:20:13,664 --> 00:20:14,596
Tank.

116
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:15,822
I know.

117
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,658
. What?
. Tank.

118
00:20:32,015 --> 00:20:33,607
It's a dead end.

119
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,758
The pass.

120
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,631
He's going to the pass.

121
00:20:52,703 --> 00:20:54,398
But why's he going to the pass?

122
00:20:54,705 --> 00:20:58,163
Why didn't he get in the helicopter?
The bastard won't leave his tank.

123
00:20:58,308 --> 00:21:00,902
Fucking bastard won't leave his tank.

124
00:21:05,782 --> 00:21:07,249
He's gone...

125
00:21:16,326 --> 00:21:17,657
Mountains.

126
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:25,491
He's gotta go around to get to the pass.

127
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,240
Short cut. You know a short cut?

128
00:21:35,312 --> 00:21:36,404
Tank.

129
00:21:37,981 --> 00:21:39,414
I understand.

130
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,081
Konstantin.

131
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,087
Konstantin.

132
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:55,964
Khan. Konstantin. Khan.

133
00:22:53,924 --> 00:22:55,755
Sir, the engine's hot.

134
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,126
Maintain 20 kilometers an hour.

135
00:22:59,696 --> 00:23:02,164
Sir, the radiator needs water.

136
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,599
Keep going.

137
00:23:04,835 --> 00:23:07,599
Goddamnit, sir,
the engine's gonna seize up!

138
00:23:08,572 --> 00:23:09,937
Keep going.

139
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:12,275
The waterhole's not far.

140
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:13,666
Do you think they radioed back?

141
00:24:14,905 --> 00:24:16,634
Of course they did.

142
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:22,504
I hate this fucking country.

143
00:24:25,315 --> 00:24:26,976
Fill the radiator.

144
00:25:54,538 --> 00:25:55,334
Kaminski!

145
00:25:57,107 --> 00:25:58,335
Golikov.

146
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:02,942
Battle stations.

147
00:26:04,214 --> 00:26:05,579
Mujahedeen.

148
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:07,882
1,000 meters.

149
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:13,120
Crank it up.

150
00:26:18,361 --> 00:26:19,828
Traversing left.

151
00:26:20,096 --> 00:26:21,996
Come on, man. Come on.

152
00:26:24,034 --> 00:26:25,467
Give me power to the tank.

153
00:26:26,736 --> 00:26:27,430
Shit.

154
00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:29,763
I can't, she won't start.

155
00:26:31,441 --> 00:26:33,238
Go to master battery.

156
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:37,309
Shit! The battery's dead, sir.

157
00:26:58,301 --> 00:26:59,461
Get us outta here.

158
00:26:59,836 --> 00:27:01,167
I'm trying.

159
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:03,096
It's overheated.

160
00:27:03,306 --> 00:27:05,206
Manual traverse left.

161
00:27:14,484 --> 00:27:15,644
Gunner.

162
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:16,944
Frag.

163
00:27:18,688 --> 00:27:20,383
We're out of frags.

164
00:27:20,457 --> 00:27:21,754
Anything.

165
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:27,296
I gotta heat up.

166
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,798
Goddamnit. Come on!

167
00:28:05,502 --> 00:28:06,799
On the way.

168
00:28:10,473 --> 00:28:12,202
Spread out!

169
00:28:13,143 --> 00:28:13,939
Up.

170
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,644
On the way.

171
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:22,581
They're in RPG range, sir.

172
00:28:32,395 --> 00:28:34,056
Come on!

173
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:38,425
I got it.

174
00:29:08,198 --> 00:29:09,290
Khan.

175
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,632
Tank. Kaput. Now.

176
00:29:13,637 --> 00:29:14,695
Now!

177
00:29:15,538 --> 00:29:17,699
Moustafa! Come on!

178
00:29:18,775 --> 00:29:20,470
I have what I want.

179
00:29:21,211 --> 00:29:22,269
The Beast escapes!

180
00:29:22,912 --> 00:29:25,210
Allah has tossed a peach in our laps <i>...</i>
Enjoy it.

181
00:29:25,582 --> 00:29:27,072
Cousin, you are a pig!

182
00:29:37,661 --> 00:29:39,652
Hasan, you are clever.

183
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,157
Can you learn a helicopter?

184
00:31:11,421 --> 00:31:12,649
This way.

185
00:31:37,514 --> 00:31:38,606
Shit.

186
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:14,077
They can't get us. We're too high.

187
00:32:14,217 --> 00:32:15,912
Come on, you son of a bitch.

188
00:32:23,927 --> 00:32:25,895
Can't get elevation, he knows it.

189
00:32:26,496 --> 00:32:27,190
Who?

190
00:32:27,297 --> 00:32:29,231
. You're mine.
<i>. Badal.</i>

191
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:32,390
. Keep 'em coming.
. Last round, sir.

192
00:32:42,412 --> 00:32:43,208
Reload.

193
00:32:43,746 --> 00:32:44,838
We're out.

194
00:32:55,291 --> 00:32:56,656
She's burning up.

195
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,789
Make it to the pass.

196
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:46,503
Sir!

197
00:33:47,343 --> 00:33:48,537
Rocket.

198
00:33:49,178 --> 00:33:50,839
I need the rocket.

199
00:34:01,157 --> 00:34:02,624
Khan! Rocket.

200
00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:04,385
Throw.

201
00:34:05,061 --> 00:34:06,255
Throw!

202
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:56,979
The pass is directly ahead.

203
00:34:57,046 --> 00:34:58,445
One hundred meters.

204
00:35:12,662 --> 00:35:14,129
Faster, Kaminski.

205
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:15,459
Yes, sir.

206
00:35:53,836 --> 00:35:55,736
It only hit the muzzle.

207
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,034
We made it, sir. We made it.

208
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:24,055
Allah! Why have you forsaken us?

209
00:37:19,689 --> 00:37:23,386
Goliath was covered with armor,
but just a rock brought him down!

210
00:37:27,029 --> 00:37:28,189
<i>Badal.</i>

211
00:38:02,565 --> 00:38:04,294
We're off the tracks, sir.

212
00:38:04,734 --> 00:38:06,133
Oh, God.

213
00:38:27,456 --> 00:38:29,185
Make a run for it, sir?

214
00:38:29,425 --> 00:38:30,392
No.

215
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,688
The gunships are coming,
we're safe in here.

216
00:38:41,637 --> 00:38:42,899
Close it!

217
00:38:48,177 --> 00:38:49,474
Tank Boy.

218
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,905
I said, Tank Boy!

219
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:55,774
I've got something for you, Tank Boy.

220
00:38:55,851 --> 00:38:57,250
Koverchenko.

221
00:39:00,556 --> 00:39:02,490
Kinda hot in there, Tank Boy?

222
00:39:02,992 --> 00:39:05,756
Sir, they got us.

223
00:39:05,828 --> 00:39:07,090
Shit.

224
00:39:07,363 --> 00:39:08,762
We gotta go up.

225
00:39:08,898 --> 00:39:10,798
We're gonna die in here.

226
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,527
Tank Boy.

227
00:39:15,304 --> 00:39:17,169
I want you, Tank Boy.

228
00:39:29,986 --> 00:39:32,181
You know our standing orders.

229
00:39:33,022 --> 00:39:34,182
What?

230
00:39:35,224 --> 00:39:38,921
"Out of commission, become a pillbox.
Out of ammo, become a bunker.

231
00:39:39,028 --> 00:39:41,428
"Out of time, become heroes."

232
00:39:47,837 --> 00:39:49,896
You must be out of your fucking mind.

233
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,367
Now. Together.

234
00:40:01,651 --> 00:40:03,050
Get the pin.

235
00:40:07,857 --> 00:40:09,757
We're gonna die in here.

236
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:11,220
Golikov.

237
00:40:11,527 --> 00:40:13,051
You son of a bitch.

238
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:14,463
Don't shoot.

239
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:17,492
Don't shoot.

240
00:40:45,828 --> 00:40:47,625
Take the knife.

241
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:56,034
Allah is too generous!

242
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:58,931
Konstantin, I didn't want to leave you.

243
00:41:00,242 --> 00:41:01,937
Just take Daskal and let us go.

244
00:41:02,978 --> 00:41:04,878
Please don't let him kill me.

245
00:41:05,381 --> 00:41:06,575
Get up.

246
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:09,710
Such unmanliness makes revenge unclean.

247
00:41:14,323 --> 00:41:15,950
<i>Nanawatai.</i>

248
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:23,130
He will always be Russian.

249
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:25,898
Move aside and I will kill them all!

250
00:41:31,841 --> 00:41:33,206
Tank kaput.

251
00:41:33,843 --> 00:41:35,208
Tank kaput.

252
00:41:36,212 --> 00:41:37,543
<i>Nanawatai.</i>

253
00:41:47,423 --> 00:41:49,914
Are you an angel or a devil?

254
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,315
Take the boots.

255
00:42:19,688 --> 00:42:21,417
Take the helmet.

256
00:42:22,324 --> 00:42:23,985
Take the boots.

257
00:42:27,797 --> 00:42:29,162
Sorry, sir.

258
00:42:30,232 --> 00:42:31,927
Not much of a war.

259
00:42:33,102 --> 00:42:34,592
No Stalingrad.

260
00:42:37,406 --> 00:42:40,204
How is it that we're the Nazis this time?

261
00:42:42,278 --> 00:42:43,677
How is that?

262
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:48,142
I tried to be a good soldier.

263
00:42:49,852 --> 00:42:53,185
But you can't be a good soldier
in a rotten war, sir.

264
00:42:55,591 --> 00:42:58,082
I want you to live to see them win.

265
00:42:59,528 --> 00:43:00,552
Go.

266
00:43:01,964 --> 00:43:03,454
I said, "Go!"

267
00:44:38,727 --> 00:44:39,785
Afghanistan.

268
00:45:10,225 --> 00:45:12,125
I don't understand you.

269
00:45:20,836 --> 00:45:22,201
Konstantin.

270
00:45:36,385 --> 00:45:38,216
Forgive me, my Khan...

271
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:43,749
Two escaped.

272
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:30,361
