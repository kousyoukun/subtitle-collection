1
00:03:08,243 --> 00:03:11,679
AFGHANISTAN, 1981

2
00:03:12,614 --> 00:03:16,015
THE SECOND YEAR
OF THE RUSSIAN INVASION

3
00:06:06,821 --> 00:06:08,186
Spread out.

4
00:06:08,656 --> 00:06:10,021
Spread out.

5
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:11,919
Move it.

6
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:16,195
Get your weapon on, Golikov.

7
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:38,476
Over here.

8
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:47,758
Kaminski.

9
00:06:59,441 --> 00:07:01,534
<i>T5447, what's your status?</i>

10
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,401
<i>Just mopping up, sir. Almost done.</i>

11
00:07:04,512 --> 00:07:07,310
<i>Rejoin the column. All units rejoin.</i>

12
00:07:07,615 --> 00:07:08,877
I got 'em.

13
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:13,114
. Did you get the sheep over there?
. Let's say there's a couple left.

14
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:15,221
<i>T5447, Roger, six.</i>

15
00:07:17,025 --> 00:07:18,856
Behind this one building...

16
00:07:19,327 --> 00:07:21,818
Sir. Gotta shoot it?

17
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:24,064
Give me the flamethrower.

18
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:27,365
- <i>What you got?</i>
. There you go, sir.

19
00:07:30,505 --> 00:07:32,496
. Over this way.
. On my way.

20
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,870
. Golikov, come on.
. I'm coming.

21
00:07:34,943 --> 00:07:36,535
Bring that cyanide canister.

22
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:39,703
Where's the extra satchels?
Bring 'em over here.

23
00:07:40,148 --> 00:07:41,615
Molotov.

24
00:07:43,818 --> 00:07:46,616
Look out at your sides.
There's another at your six.

25
00:07:47,055 --> 00:07:48,522
Oh, my God.

26
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:53,183
I'm burning!

27
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,460
Right there.

28
00:08:03,605 --> 00:08:04,867
Oh, God.

29
00:08:05,273 --> 00:08:06,040
I can't put it out.

30
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,064
I can't put it out.

31
00:08:24,926 --> 00:08:27,087
. You owe me one.
. Get him over here.

32
00:08:27,262 --> 00:08:29,526
Come on, get his arm. Come on.

33
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:31,866
Move it!

34
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:35,793
You son of a bitch!

35
00:08:36,237 --> 00:08:37,966
You're dead!

36
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,248
Put him under the track.

37
00:08:59,093 --> 00:09:00,924
Put your feet under there.

38
00:09:01,262 --> 00:09:03,230
Do you want me to kick him?

39
00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:06,194
You think you can kill my friends
and get away with it?

40
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:08,458
Koverchenko, mount and crank it up.

41
00:09:08,536 --> 00:09:11,061
We're gonna squash you like a grape.

42
00:09:11,506 --> 00:09:13,701
Ask him where the other rebels are.

43
00:09:17,745 --> 00:09:19,007
Where are the rebels?

44
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,339
Mujahedeen are all around you!

45
00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:25,610
Ten Russian dogs will die for every Afghan!

46
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,246
What did he say?

47
00:09:27,722 --> 00:09:29,587
He does not know, sir.

48
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:32,491
Tell them to stop.

49
00:09:35,997 --> 00:09:36,986
No further!

50
00:09:37,732 --> 00:09:39,199
Let him go!

51
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:42,763
Sherina! I order you away from here!

52
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,374
This commander prefers bullets
to words. Go!

53
00:09:53,147 --> 00:09:54,239
Traitor!

54
00:09:54,816 --> 00:09:58,752
Tell your shit eater of a
commander to let him go!

55
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:04,352
These women,
they humbly beg you for the prisoner, sir.

56
00:10:07,428 --> 00:10:10,727
You tell them to watch
what happens to him.

57
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:14,995
Do it.

58
00:10:22,577 --> 00:10:23,976
He is to be my husband!

59
00:10:26,147 --> 00:10:29,139
No Russian will escape Afghanistan!

60
00:10:32,286 --> 00:10:33,378
Forward.

61
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:48,195
Forward!

62
00:10:49,203 --> 00:10:52,172
Allah is the only God...!

63
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,869
- <i>Direction, sir?</i>
- <i>Right fork.</i>

64
00:11:31,112 --> 00:11:32,875
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>Right fork.</i>

65
00:11:34,982 --> 00:11:36,210
<i>Sir, are you sure?</i>

66
00:11:36,384 --> 00:11:39,046
<i>Driver, I said, "Right fork." Do you copy?</i>

67
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,682
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

68
00:11:40,955 --> 00:11:44,447
<i>T5447, do you copy?</i>

69
00:11:44,892 --> 00:11:46,655
<i>What's your position?</i>

70
00:11:47,595 --> 00:11:49,995
- <i>Why can't they hear us?</i>
- <i>Do you copy?</i>

71
00:11:50,198 --> 00:11:51,893
<i>T5447, do you copy?</i>

72
00:11:53,534 --> 00:11:54,967
<i>T5447...</i>

73
00:11:58,573 --> 00:12:00,097
The tank is lost.

74
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,197
No...

75
00:12:01,642 --> 00:12:03,109
We need help.

76
00:12:45,953 --> 00:12:47,250
Hasaad!

77
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,560
Taj...

78
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:32,897
Uncle...

79
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:34,434
Come on.

80
00:13:39,073 --> 00:13:40,506
Uncle... why?

81
00:13:41,676 --> 00:13:42,973
Retaliation.

82
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:15,465
Be his mother.

83
00:14:21,515 --> 00:14:22,743
Sherina.

84
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:40,801
Moustafa!

85
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:53,040
Salaam, Taj Mohamed.

86
00:15:04,392 --> 00:15:05,757
Cousin, truce.

87
00:15:06,193 --> 00:15:07,319
Greetings, uncle.

88
00:15:07,495 --> 00:15:08,587
Salaam, Moustafa.

89
00:15:17,738 --> 00:15:21,435
I always said, have faith in
Allah and keep a hidden pistol.

90
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:24,806
Every part of me screams
to see your blood.

91
00:15:25,613 --> 00:15:27,740
Nothing has changed between us, then.

92
00:15:29,116 --> 00:15:32,711
Taj, your father would never
dishonor a truce.

93
00:15:33,354 --> 00:15:34,616
What do you want here?

94
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:42,059
One of the tanks that killed your people
is lost in the valley of the Jackal.

95
00:15:42,263 --> 00:15:44,424
I know that valley.

96
00:15:45,132 --> 00:15:48,659
It only has one way in and out.

97
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,765
I come to call upon your
honor to avenge Afghanistan.

98
00:15:54,508 --> 00:15:56,533
When Moustafa talks of honor...

99
00:15:57,011 --> 00:15:59,605
...the end of the world is at hand.

100
00:16:01,782 --> 00:16:04,307
Cousin, uncle, we are tired
of this ancient vendetta.

101
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:07,483
Let us take revenge together...
We divide the booty.

102
00:16:10,358 --> 00:16:14,658
I will not fight with a scavenger...

103
00:16:15,162 --> 00:16:18,393
...who picks gold from the
teeth of dead Russians.

104
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,293
Then run to Pakistan.

105
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,070
I would speak with the Khan.

106
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:28,702
My father was killed.

107
00:16:30,044 --> 00:16:32,535
My brother Shahzaman is now Khan.

108
00:16:34,548 --> 00:16:36,778
Your brother was martyred
by a Russian tank.

109
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:46,856
You are now Khan, Taj Mohamed.

110
00:16:55,736 --> 00:16:56,862
Shahzaman.

111
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:06,871
My Khan, we would fight with
you to avenge Shahzaman.

112
00:17:10,785 --> 00:17:12,616
With this we can destroy the tank!

113
00:17:12,887 --> 00:17:14,411
I know how to work it!

114
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,757
What do you say, Taj?

115
00:17:22,196 --> 00:17:25,688
Your brother did not go to
Pakistan... He went to Paradise.

116
00:17:35,876 --> 00:17:37,104
Allah...

117
00:17:38,012 --> 00:17:41,971
Give me a man to tear apart.

118
00:17:42,783 --> 00:17:45,274
From this time forth...

119
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,755
...I am a stone in your sling!

120
00:17:49,723 --> 00:17:51,213
Revenge!

121
00:18:36,203 --> 00:18:38,228
Sir, I can't seem to raise them.

122
00:18:45,713 --> 00:18:46,975
Scared as shit!

123
00:18:47,047 --> 00:18:48,275
Come on!

124
00:18:48,449 --> 00:18:50,713
Got any of that splash on you?

125
00:18:55,856 --> 00:18:56,880
Sir.

126
00:18:56,957 --> 00:18:58,322
Where the hell are we?

127
00:18:58,392 --> 00:18:59,984
I don't know, sir.

128
00:19:01,562 --> 00:19:03,257
How do we get to Kandahar Road?

129
00:19:03,364 --> 00:19:04,991
I'm not sure, sir.

130
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:07,162
The Molotov took our radio out.

131
00:19:07,368 --> 00:19:10,064
We get reception but no transmission, sir.

132
00:19:19,113 --> 00:19:21,013
Those hills must be here.

133
00:19:22,983 --> 00:19:25,543
Kandahar Road is on the other side
of those hills?

134
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:29,419
I'm not sure. The grid coordinates
are 31 degrees latitude<i>...</i>

135
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,015
Samad, you're relieved of your post.

136
00:19:32,226 --> 00:19:33,750
Give the log to Koverchenko.

137
00:19:33,827 --> 00:19:36,819
. For what reason?
. Incompetence. Record it.

138
00:19:37,097 --> 00:19:38,655
. What is my function?
. None.

139
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:41,527
Give yourself a battlefield commendation.

140
00:19:41,635 --> 00:19:44,832
. For what, sir?
. For trying to save those tankers.

141
00:19:46,907 --> 00:19:48,374
To your post!

142
00:19:52,813 --> 00:19:55,714
Just say, "Yes, sir,"
and keep out of his way.

143
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:56,941
Okay.

144
00:19:57,484 --> 00:20:00,248
Why did that rebel we ran over
laugh at me?

145
00:20:00,321 --> 00:20:02,687
He wasn't laughing at you, he was happy.

146
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:06,089
Such men believe if they die in a Holy War,
they will go to Paradise.

147
00:20:06,227 --> 00:20:08,127
Do you believe that?

148
00:20:09,597 --> 00:20:12,566
After university,
I'm not sure what I believe.

149
00:20:31,352 --> 00:20:33,252
I need a woman!

150
00:20:34,421 --> 00:20:36,286
Maybe you'll find another sheep.

151
00:20:36,357 --> 00:20:37,722
Maybe I will.

152
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,725
Kaminski, turn that music off.

153
00:20:39,793 --> 00:20:41,693
Golikov put it on, sir.

154
00:20:42,696 --> 00:20:44,425
Kaminski, you shit!

155
00:20:49,637 --> 00:20:52,800
Come here for a second.
I've got something to show you.

156
00:21:07,321 --> 00:21:08,720
Crank it up!

157
00:21:11,025 --> 00:21:11,821
Gunner.

158
00:21:14,061 --> 00:21:16,029
Troops on the ridge!

159
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:20,656
Turret power.

160
00:21:26,607 --> 00:21:27,505
Range.

161
00:21:27,775 --> 00:21:29,538
Three. Zero. Zero.

162
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:33,507
At my command.

163
00:21:33,747 --> 00:21:35,237
What's around?

164
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,345
Get it out of here.

165
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,414
Ready to roll.

166
00:21:41,488 --> 00:21:43,149
Driver. Forward. Go!

167
00:21:48,162 --> 00:21:48,890
Frag!

168
00:21:49,196 --> 00:21:50,788
Heads up, Samad.

169
00:21:51,231 --> 00:21:52,163
Traversing.

170
00:21:58,906 --> 00:21:59,600
Up.

171
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:01,902
Fire.

172
00:22:02,242 --> 00:22:03,402
On the way.

173
00:22:22,996 --> 00:22:23,860
Let's go!

174
00:22:29,703 --> 00:22:30,829
Moustafa.

175
00:22:34,475 --> 00:22:36,443
You said you could kill the tank
in one shot!

176
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,377
Maybe it is not the will of Allah.

177
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:42,474
Or maybe you are a bad shot!

178
00:22:43,117 --> 00:22:44,448
I am Khan!

179
00:22:44,852 --> 00:22:47,286
I demand to be the one
to explode the tank!

180
00:22:48,288 --> 00:22:50,313
Give me the RPG!

181
00:22:51,492 --> 00:22:53,619
Your nephew is a hothead, uncle.

182
00:22:55,662 --> 00:22:56,890
Moustafa.

183
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:04,394
We all stay together!

184
00:23:04,638 --> 00:23:05,605
Taj.

185
00:23:06,206 --> 00:23:08,606
Who calls himself Khan is not a Khan.

186
00:23:09,343 --> 00:23:10,537
Patience, Taj.

187
00:23:10,744 --> 00:23:12,234
This is your trial.

188
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,182
Uncle?

189
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:21,146
It's nothing. A scratch.

190
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:24,891
Come...

191
00:23:26,226 --> 00:23:29,354
Allah gives us tracks to follow.

192
00:23:32,966 --> 00:23:35,526
Khanzaman! Afzal! Come on!

193
00:25:08,595 --> 00:25:11,086
Only one drank the water,
goddamnit. Samad!

194
00:25:11,198 --> 00:25:13,393
I told you to throw the canister far away.

195
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,797
They found it.

196
00:25:15,602 --> 00:25:17,695
At my command, gunner. Frag.

197
00:25:18,772 --> 00:25:19,739
Move.

198
00:25:20,207 --> 00:25:21,435
Move it.

199
00:25:24,411 --> 00:25:25,537
Frag is up.

200
00:25:25,946 --> 00:25:27,607
. Fire.
. On the way.

201
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,342
Misfire.

202
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,147
Go to manual.

203
00:25:36,156 --> 00:25:37,248
Misfire.

204
00:25:37,357 --> 00:25:38,881
Out of the tank!

205
00:26:00,714 --> 00:26:02,477
. What happened?
. Misfire.

206
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:04,517
I know it's gonna blow.

207
00:26:04,918 --> 00:26:07,045
The shell looked okay to me.

208
00:26:08,722 --> 00:26:10,553
. Samad.
. Yes, sir?

209
00:26:10,724 --> 00:26:12,624
Did you touch that shell?

210
00:26:13,694 --> 00:26:14,922
Yes, sir.

211
00:26:15,762 --> 00:26:18,663
I just handed it...
I handed it to Golikov, sir.

212
00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:20,093
That's all.

213
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:23,432
Misfires happen, sir.
One in every 100 rounds.

214
00:26:23,937 --> 00:26:25,165
Cook. Off.

215
00:26:29,076 --> 00:26:31,909
It's the loader's responsibility to unload.

216
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:33,907
Golikov.

217
00:26:37,517 --> 00:26:40,281
Sir, I've never handled a cook. Off before.

218
00:26:43,156 --> 00:26:44,817
I will do it, sir.

219
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:50,191
He doesn't know what he's doing.
Let me go in there.

220
00:26:55,769 --> 00:26:56,861
All right.

221
00:26:57,137 --> 00:26:58,399
. Kaminski.
. Sir?

222
00:26:58,672 --> 00:27:00,401
Pinpoint the Mujas.

223
00:27:00,907 --> 00:27:03,501
. Don't take your eyes off them.
. Yes, sir.

224
00:27:03,644 --> 00:27:05,509
Koverchenko. Golikov.

225
00:27:25,065 --> 00:27:26,589
Come on.

226
00:27:55,829 --> 00:27:58,059
Sir, maybe I ought to do this.

227
00:27:58,699 --> 00:28:00,132
What if something happens?

228
00:28:01,968 --> 00:28:04,801
Then Kaminski will have his first command.

229
00:28:10,877 --> 00:28:13,311
Just tell me one thing, Koverchenko.

230
00:28:14,381 --> 00:28:16,872
Why do you stick up for the Afghan?

231
00:28:17,884 --> 00:28:20,079
Because he's doing his best, sir.

232
00:28:21,021 --> 00:28:22,921
That's what worries me.

233
00:28:26,626 --> 00:28:29,322
You've got what it takes. I've seen it.

234
00:28:30,163 --> 00:28:32,597
Keep your head on straight.

235
00:28:37,537 --> 00:28:39,505
Why don't we turn and fight the rebels?

236
00:28:39,573 --> 00:28:43,737
'Cause they could put a fucking hole
right through us with that RPG.

237
00:29:02,162 --> 00:29:03,629
Come on, go.

238
00:29:06,967 --> 00:29:08,161
Come on.

239
00:29:09,102 --> 00:29:11,798
. What the hell happened?
. They're gone, sir.

240
00:29:11,872 --> 00:29:14,363
Lucky bastards don't know
Samad saved their lives.

241
00:29:14,474 --> 00:29:16,271
I didn't do anything.

242
00:29:19,713 --> 00:29:21,647
Booby trap that round.

243
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:23,607
Come on.

244
00:29:23,683 --> 00:29:25,446
Driver, crank it up.

245
00:29:31,024 --> 00:29:32,252
Careful.

246
00:29:39,032 --> 00:29:40,727
<i>Get us out of here.</i>

247
00:29:41,067 --> 00:29:42,466
Moving tank.

248
00:30:34,487 --> 00:30:38,253
We bleed because we are weak
for Russian junk.

249
00:30:43,296 --> 00:30:45,992
Your mujahed has no chance to live.

250
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,697
Our uncle is wounded too.
Let him stay here with Noor.

251
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:55,232
My wound will heal
when I see the tank explode.

252
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,144
We leave him food and water.

253
00:31:32,612 --> 00:31:33,670
God is great.

254
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,757
Another grave.

255
00:32:24,397 --> 00:32:28,424
The wind covers the tank tracks...
we want to return to the village.

256
00:32:28,535 --> 00:32:32,835
You have no village <i>...</i> only "Badal"!

257
00:33:12,479 --> 00:33:14,003
A Holy Man.

258
00:33:25,325 --> 00:33:27,350
David! You have come!

259
00:33:29,696 --> 00:33:33,598
Prophet Mohamed bid me build
a fire to light your way.

260
00:33:34,267 --> 00:33:37,498
God willing, with only a stone
you will slay The Beast, David!

261
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:40,206
What Beast?

262
00:33:41,207 --> 00:33:42,333
Goliath!

263
00:33:45,378 --> 00:33:46,936
Look Taj... tank tracks!

264
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,797
Build a fire, sir?

265
00:34:14,841 --> 00:34:17,571
I'm sure you lost those Muja. Fucks, sir.

266
00:34:18,378 --> 00:34:20,209
Tend to the track, Kaminski.

267
00:34:20,914 --> 00:34:22,506
You got it, sir.

268
00:34:28,822 --> 00:34:30,050
Oh, God.

269
00:34:31,825 --> 00:34:33,690
Let me hit that thing.

270
00:34:34,561 --> 00:34:38,088
It is called <i>Pakhtunali.</i>
It's the code of honor.

271
00:34:40,834 --> 00:34:42,461
Three obligations.

272
00:34:42,669 --> 00:34:45,832
First, "<i>Milmastia</i>," hospitality.

273
00:34:48,074 --> 00:34:51,237
Second, "<i>Badal</i>," revenge.

274
00:34:53,746 --> 00:34:56,078
Third, "<i>Nanawatai</i>."

275
00:34:56,249 --> 00:35:00,686
The obligation to give sanctuary
to all those who ask.

276
00:35:01,988 --> 00:35:03,956
. To all?
. AII.

277
00:35:04,457 --> 00:35:06,618
. Even the enemy?
. AII.

278
00:35:08,862 --> 00:35:10,989
What if I kill your brother...

279
00:35:11,598 --> 00:35:14,465
...and you come for <i>Badal,</i> revenge?

280
00:35:15,101 --> 00:35:17,069
And I ask for <i>Nanawatai</i>?

281
00:35:17,971 --> 00:35:21,805
Then I would be obligated to feed,
clothe and protect you.

282
00:35:22,442 --> 00:35:24,535
That's incredibly civilized.

283
00:35:25,812 --> 00:35:27,507
What is it, <i>Nanawatai</i>?

284
00:35:31,818 --> 00:35:32,842
Bread?

285
00:35:41,161 --> 00:35:44,790
Smells like he's been chewing
on fucking buffalo shit.

286
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:53,564
When we get back,
you gotta transfer out of this tank.

287
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,335
I'll win his respect in time.

288
00:35:55,408 --> 00:35:57,103
Listen to me.

289
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:00,479
When he gets on your back
there's no way to shake him.

290
00:36:00,647 --> 00:36:02,376
My dear Konstantin.

291
00:36:02,549 --> 00:36:05,916
I regard this abuse
as the price I must pay to learn.

292
00:36:06,886 --> 00:36:11,414
I love Afghanistan,
but we are a flea in the tail of a bear.

293
00:36:12,592 --> 00:36:14,753
We must join the 20th century.

294
00:36:15,228 --> 00:36:18,857
And when Afghans accept that,
I will be there.

295
00:36:19,465 --> 00:36:21,933
Knowing technology and Russian.

296
00:36:22,368 --> 00:36:24,836
. So, you're a patriot?
. Yes.

297
00:36:25,405 --> 00:36:26,599
So was that rebel.

298
00:36:26,739 --> 00:36:29,708
He wanted to keep things
the way they've always been.

299
00:36:29,776 --> 00:36:32,006
I wish I believed in something that much.

300
00:36:32,145 --> 00:36:33,510
I envy him.

301
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,373
Then why did you crush him?

302
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,845
Because I had no choice.

303
00:36:39,652 --> 00:36:41,620
. You always have a choice.
. Give it.

304
00:36:41,688 --> 00:36:43,883
You never told me
she sent nudes of herself.

305
00:36:43,957 --> 00:36:45,686
Give it to me.

306
00:36:46,659 --> 00:36:48,718
She's got that nympho look.

307
00:36:51,664 --> 00:36:53,655
I got the half I want.

308
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,873
You son of a bitch.

309
00:37:02,008 --> 00:37:03,771
Get the fuck off me.

310
00:37:06,546 --> 00:37:09,344
. What the hell is going on?
. Nothing, sir.

311
00:37:15,088 --> 00:37:16,817
Thanks, Konstantin.

312
00:37:27,634 --> 00:37:29,101
What is this?

313
00:37:33,873 --> 00:37:35,170
Brake fluid!

314
00:37:35,241 --> 00:37:37,266
No wonder they don't work.

315
00:37:38,077 --> 00:37:40,238
It keeps me steady on the gun, sir.

316
00:37:40,313 --> 00:37:42,975
I filter it through bread,
and get out all the shit.

317
00:37:43,049 --> 00:37:46,018
Then I put in raisins and sugar,
I put it out in the sun.

318
00:37:46,085 --> 00:37:48,610
It ferments in a few days.
Gets a pretty good kick.

319
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:55,083
Write him up, sir?

320
00:37:55,194 --> 00:37:56,684
Get over here.

321
00:38:01,534 --> 00:38:03,092
For one mistake?

322
00:38:03,403 --> 00:38:05,633
He's the best gunner in the division.

323
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:07,066
Omit it.

324
00:38:07,407 --> 00:38:09,739
It's already done, sir. In ink.

325
00:38:51,017 --> 00:38:54,043
You'd better watch your ass from now on.

326
00:38:55,021 --> 00:38:58,479
Sometimes Afghan snipers
pick off tank drivers.

327
00:38:59,759 --> 00:39:02,159
Sometimes tank drivers pick 'em off first.

328
00:39:05,465 --> 00:39:06,432
Grenade!

329
00:39:08,368 --> 00:39:09,733
Get down!

330
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:11,868
Shit.

331
00:39:23,983 --> 00:39:25,280
Don't blow it up!

332
00:39:25,785 --> 00:39:28,117
Kill the Russians underneath, not the tank!

333
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:32,655
Grenade!

334
00:39:37,597 --> 00:39:38,655
Open the hatch.

335
00:39:38,865 --> 00:39:41,163
We're getting slaughtered down here.

336
00:39:41,434 --> 00:39:42,867
Open the hatch.

337
00:39:43,569 --> 00:39:45,036
I'm bleeding.

338
00:39:51,711 --> 00:39:52,700
Inside.

339
00:39:52,912 --> 00:39:53,936
Get inside.

340
00:39:54,113 --> 00:39:56,343
Get in the tank. Hurry up!

341
00:40:00,186 --> 00:40:02,916
Koverchenko, get us the hell outta here.

342
00:40:03,489 --> 00:40:04,751
Hurry up!

343
00:40:07,326 --> 00:40:09,260
We've got a fire on top.

344
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:11,897
. I'm dying!
. I can't see.

345
00:40:11,931 --> 00:40:12,920
I'm dying!

346
00:40:13,132 --> 00:40:14,429
Hard right!

347
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,935
Gunner, traverse right, 180.

348
00:40:22,909 --> 00:40:24,376
I'm dying!

349
00:40:25,211 --> 00:40:26,337
Traversing.

350
00:40:28,748 --> 00:40:30,716
I can't see through the fire, sir!

351
00:40:42,395 --> 00:40:43,987
Gunner, identify.

352
00:40:44,464 --> 00:40:46,489
Bead on the fire of our campsite!

353
00:40:46,666 --> 00:40:48,497
I can't get elevation.

354
00:41:59,438 --> 00:42:02,271
We can detect anything
in 100 meter radius.

355
00:42:04,377 --> 00:42:07,778
They must have camels.
That's got to be how they're keeping up.

356
00:42:08,014 --> 00:42:10,209
I can't believe how bad
they want this tank.

357
00:42:10,283 --> 00:42:12,615
. They just keep coming.
. Shut up.

358
00:42:15,755 --> 00:42:17,814
How much longer do we stay here?

359
00:42:18,891 --> 00:42:21,826
Till first light when we can see
where we're going.

360
00:42:21,961 --> 00:42:23,223
Crack the hatch, sir?

361
00:42:23,329 --> 00:42:24,159
No.

362
00:42:25,031 --> 00:42:26,328
Sir, I have to piss.

363
00:42:26,632 --> 00:42:27,599
Hold it.

364
00:42:28,935 --> 00:42:30,835
Do we have any water, Samad?

365
00:42:31,637 --> 00:42:34,970
All the canteens were left behind.
All the rations, too.

366
00:42:35,374 --> 00:42:36,705
Great.

367
00:42:36,943 --> 00:42:38,934
Your pals will feast tonight.

368
00:42:39,412 --> 00:42:42,404
We don't need food and water.
We're safe in here.

369
00:42:46,552 --> 00:42:49,146
My tanks have been hit by everything.

370
00:42:50,489 --> 00:42:52,957
In Mongolia once...

371
00:42:53,993 --> 00:42:56,894
RPG. Direct hit.

372
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:03,666
Commander, gunner and turret went flying.

373
00:43:12,178 --> 00:43:15,170
I drove the rest of the tank
back to our lines.

374
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:20,480
These tanks today are better.

375
00:43:21,721 --> 00:43:23,313
Much better.

376
00:43:35,968 --> 00:43:38,061
I don't think I can hold it much longer.

377
00:43:38,371 --> 00:43:39,269
Sir!

378
00:43:41,607 --> 00:43:43,336
. How many?
.20, 25.

379
00:43:43,409 --> 00:43:44,967
They're all around us.

380
00:43:45,044 --> 00:43:46,375
Battle stations!

381
00:43:46,445 --> 00:43:49,346
Wait. I don't think they see us,
the way they're moving.

382
00:43:49,415 --> 00:43:51,280
They're in effective RPG range.

383
00:43:51,917 --> 00:43:53,441
Gunner, troops, frag.

384
00:43:53,686 --> 00:43:54,983
Frag is up, sir.

385
00:43:55,054 --> 00:43:55,850
Identify.

386
00:43:55,955 --> 00:43:58,287
I can't identify, it's too dark.

387
00:44:01,994 --> 00:44:02,824
Go to IR.

388
00:44:02,895 --> 00:44:03,987
IR is busted.

389
00:44:04,096 --> 00:44:05,996
They're all around us, sir.

390
00:44:07,133 --> 00:44:09,067
Stand by to traverse left, 360.

391
00:44:09,335 --> 00:44:11,633
All weapons fire at my command.

392
00:44:12,738 --> 00:44:14,569
Traverse. Fire!

393
00:44:22,615 --> 00:44:23,274
Up.

394
00:44:29,488 --> 00:44:31,046
Cease fire!

395
00:44:38,931 --> 00:44:39,955
All dead, sir.

396
00:44:48,908 --> 00:44:49,704
Samad.

397
00:44:50,976 --> 00:44:52,307
Go verify.

398
00:44:57,416 --> 00:44:58,849
. Move it.
. Yes, sir.

399
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,777
Kaminski, stand down.

400
00:45:35,821 --> 00:45:37,755
Koverchenko, get on the co. Ax.

401
00:45:45,865 --> 00:45:47,332
Set Samad in your sights.

402
00:45:47,767 --> 00:45:48,734
What?

403
00:45:49,235 --> 00:45:50,793
Take him now, he's a traitor.

404
00:45:54,907 --> 00:45:56,204
Are you insane?

405
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:00,673
Your insubordination has gotten you
demoted from Intelligence...

406
00:46:00,746 --> 00:46:04,614
...to Rescue Operations, to this tank.
Your next stop is prison.

407
00:46:05,317 --> 00:46:08,946
With a record like that,
I wouldn't disobey another order.

408
00:46:11,123 --> 00:46:12,317
Take Samad, now.

409
00:46:19,698 --> 00:46:21,188
No.

410
00:46:31,177 --> 00:46:32,667
How many dead?

411
00:46:33,412 --> 00:46:34,504
It's deer, sir.

412
00:46:37,249 --> 00:46:38,807
It's a herd of deer.

413
00:46:56,235 --> 00:46:59,261
The Russian kills just to kill.

414
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:16,019
We're leaking oil, sir.

415
00:47:16,388 --> 00:47:19,755
. Raise the snorkel and seal the cannon.
. Are we going under water?

416
00:47:19,925 --> 00:47:23,292
There are rebels behind us
and they're following our tracks.

417
00:48:20,653 --> 00:48:22,553
Samad, stop it.

418
00:48:26,191 --> 00:48:27,749
I'm in my prayers, sir.

419
00:48:28,294 --> 00:48:29,056
Get up.

420
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,067
Sir.

421
00:48:37,603 --> 00:48:40,970
If I'm able to reconcile
dialectical materialism and Allah...

422
00:48:41,507 --> 00:48:43,441
...isn't that my business?

423
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:47,337
Why do you not trust me, sir?

424
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,648
You know I'm a member of the Party.

425
00:48:51,417 --> 00:48:53,715
My son is in the cultural exchange
in Moscow.

426
00:48:53,819 --> 00:48:56,117
Do you think I would compromise my son?

427
00:48:56,488 --> 00:48:57,785
I said, "Get up."

428
00:49:02,861 --> 00:49:04,852
See how deep the river is.

429
00:49:06,799 --> 00:49:07,561
How, sir?

430
00:49:09,301 --> 00:49:10,666
Walk in it.

431
00:49:20,846 --> 00:49:22,609
You don't need that.

432
00:49:39,398 --> 00:49:41,263
Like ice, sir.

433
00:49:41,967 --> 00:49:44,026
I didn't ask for the temperature.

434
00:49:46,472 --> 00:49:48,565
Is the bottom mud or stone?

435
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:52,170
Stone.

436
00:49:57,149 --> 00:49:58,173
No!

437
00:50:06,558 --> 00:50:07,616
Why?

438
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,025
. I said, "Why?"
. Shut up!

439
00:50:15,834 --> 00:50:17,301
What are you doing?

440
00:50:17,536 --> 00:50:18,560
Recording, sir.

441
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:22,572
Write yourself up. This time your
insubordination's got you a court. Martial.

442
00:50:22,641 --> 00:50:25,235
So will killing your own men, sir!

443
00:50:47,433 --> 00:50:50,266
If you were commander,
you would've done the same thing.

444
00:50:50,469 --> 00:50:54,599
Samad was waiting for his chance
to deliver this tank to the enemy.

445
00:50:57,810 --> 00:50:59,835
But I was too smart for him.

446
00:51:00,846 --> 00:51:03,041
And I didn't study philosophy.

447
00:51:04,183 --> 00:51:07,016
I read your dossier, Mr. Intellectual.

448
00:51:07,753 --> 00:51:10,381
What would you say
your record says about you?

449
00:51:11,223 --> 00:51:13,350
That I think for myself.

450
00:51:16,829 --> 00:51:18,729
You think for yourself.

451
00:51:19,998 --> 00:51:24,526
When I was eight years old defending
Stalingrad, I didn't think for myself.

452
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:27,768
When the Motherland asked for our lives,
we gave.

453
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:30,773
My father didn't think of himself, he gave.

454
00:51:30,976 --> 00:51:33,001
My mother didn't think of herself,
she gave.

455
00:51:33,078 --> 00:51:35,979
My brother didn't think of himself, he gave.

456
00:51:37,983 --> 00:51:42,249
My comrades tied a rope around my waist
and lowered me on top of Nazi tanks.

457
00:51:42,454 --> 00:51:45,446
I stuffed Molotovs under turret and cannon.

458
00:51:46,592 --> 00:51:49,561
And they pulled me up again.
Eight years old.

459
00:51:52,865 --> 00:51:54,423
They called me Tank Boy.

460
00:51:57,202 --> 00:51:59,295
I took a lot of Nazi tanks.

461
00:52:02,107 --> 00:52:02,937
A lot.

462
00:52:06,645 --> 00:52:09,739
Over the years,
I've learned to smell a traitor.

463
00:52:52,457 --> 00:52:54,891
. How bad is it?
. You mean the tank?

464
00:52:57,062 --> 00:52:59,656
Konstantin, do you think he's snapped?

465
00:53:01,366 --> 00:53:03,596
. What are you doing?
. What?

466
00:53:03,702 --> 00:53:06,432
You wanna be next?
Don't be seen talking to this asshole.

467
00:53:06,972 --> 00:53:08,303
How much further can we go?

468
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,264
Not far enough.

469
00:53:10,442 --> 00:53:12,535
We should just ditch this bitch...

470
00:53:12,778 --> 00:53:16,043
...dismantle the dosh gun,
fucking walk to Kandahar Road.

471
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:18,645
What are you whispering about?

472
00:53:23,222 --> 00:53:25,486
Kaminski had an interesting idea, sir.

473
00:53:27,159 --> 00:53:29,389
Ditching the tank and walking back.

474
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:33,022
He's a fucking liar, sir!

475
00:53:35,834 --> 00:53:39,463
As a man who thinks for himself,
Koverchenko, what do you think?

476
00:53:42,641 --> 00:53:45,474
Well, sir, the road wheel's cracked.

477
00:53:45,877 --> 00:53:48,937
Kaminski drank our brakes.
We're low on petrol.

478
00:53:49,047 --> 00:53:51,572
The battery's low, we're losing oil.

479
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,684
If the engine heats up, it'll seize.

480
00:53:53,752 --> 00:53:56,949
Terrain, obviously against us.
We have no rations.

481
00:53:57,022 --> 00:54:00,981
The Mujas don't seem to need rations,
petrol or anything we know of and...

482
00:54:01,126 --> 00:54:02,616
...they have an RPG.

483
00:54:04,496 --> 00:54:06,657
Their aim is getting better, sir.

484
00:54:09,534 --> 00:54:11,331
You admire them, don't you?

485
00:54:12,838 --> 00:54:14,806
They've got us on the run, don't they?

486
00:54:15,407 --> 00:54:17,807
What do you suggest? Surrender?

487
00:54:23,448 --> 00:54:26,906
Clearly, that's a direct violation
of Soviet military law.

488
00:54:27,753 --> 00:54:30,187
But you're all for it, aren't you?

489
00:54:30,455 --> 00:54:32,446
That's mutiny, Koverchenko.

490
00:54:36,628 --> 00:54:37,822
Try it.

491
00:54:38,864 --> 00:54:41,424
Kaminski, get his weapon. Cover him.

492
00:54:41,767 --> 00:54:43,029
Yes, sir.

493
00:54:43,602 --> 00:54:45,502
Golikov, get some rope.

494
00:54:52,177 --> 00:54:53,235
Now!

495
00:54:56,214 --> 00:54:57,416
Tie him to that rock.

496
00:54:57,416 --> 00:54:58,007
Tie him to that rock.

497
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:01,515
I'll haunt you, Kaminski.
I'll be your worst nightmare.

498
00:55:01,586 --> 00:55:02,814
Shut up.

499
00:55:03,722 --> 00:55:05,121
You hear me?

500
00:55:06,792 --> 00:55:09,352
. Be an idiot.
. I don't believe this.

501
00:55:10,595 --> 00:55:12,187
Hold still, asshole.

502
00:55:12,297 --> 00:55:14,390
. What are we doing?
. You shut up!

503
00:55:16,368 --> 00:55:18,393
He fucking stepped in this one himself.

504
00:55:18,537 --> 00:55:20,004
You're a fucking lackey!

505
00:55:21,173 --> 00:55:22,037
Fuck.

506
00:55:22,941 --> 00:55:25,068
. Get the log book.
. Yes, sir.

507
00:55:26,545 --> 00:55:29,708
He doesn't have it, sir.
He must've left it in the tank.

508
00:55:29,781 --> 00:55:31,180
Booby trap him.

509
00:55:33,385 --> 00:55:35,945
Twisted, insane. Don't be an idiot.

510
00:55:36,021 --> 00:55:37,454
Don't move.

511
00:55:43,428 --> 00:55:45,328
If you need anything...

512
00:55:45,464 --> 00:55:46,863
...just nod.

513
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:00,275
Konstantin, I'm sorry.

514
00:56:01,513 --> 00:56:03,378
Anton, you're next.

515
00:56:04,249 --> 00:56:07,844
Go to the tank, blow his brains out,
come back and untie me.

516
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,117
. You're next.
. I can't.

517
00:56:10,255 --> 00:56:11,779
You hear me?

518
00:56:12,023 --> 00:56:14,924
Anton, don't leave me here. Don't leave.

519
00:56:15,494 --> 00:56:16,893
. I can't.
. Untie me.

520
00:56:18,764 --> 00:56:20,789
You're a good soldier.

521
00:56:20,899 --> 00:56:24,335
You can be counted on
when they ask you to shoot your mother.

522
00:56:24,503 --> 00:56:26,596
Golikov! Goddamnit.

523
00:56:31,676 --> 00:56:33,701
Don't leave me here, you coward.

524
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,941
Golikov, you fuck.

525
00:57:09,548 --> 00:57:11,709
I think you did the right thing, sir.

526
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:14,043
I appreciate that, Kaminski.

527
00:57:14,686 --> 00:57:17,951
I think I speak for all of us when I say that.

528
00:57:20,192 --> 00:57:24,390
What he wrote in here could
close doors for the rest of your lives.

529
00:57:25,697 --> 00:57:28,427
I don't know why you
didn't just kill him, sir.

530
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,268
I was trying to buy us some time.

1
00:57:37,197 --> 00:57:39,755
The tank's roomier now.

2
00:57:55,082 --> 00:57:56,549
Sherina!

3
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:59,041
What are you doing here?
