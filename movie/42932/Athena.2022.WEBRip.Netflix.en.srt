1
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:15,833
A tense atmosphere
outside the Athena estate.

2
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:20,542
The third case of police brutality
in two months rocks the country.

3
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:24,417
No comment
from the Ministry of the Interior.

4
00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:34,875
We spoke to the Chief Inspector.

5
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,125
My brother died at 00:30.

6
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:43,500
We're yet to ID the officers in the video.

7
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:49,125
An exhaustive investigation
has been promised.

8
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,958
Justice will be served.

9
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:56,792
In memory of Idir,

10
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:01,083
my little brother, please stay calm

11
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,708
at tomorrow's silent march.

12
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:07,375
Thank you.

13
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,375
Thank you, Abdel.

14
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:15,833
It is beyond belief
that officers would close ranks

15
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:22,125
and feign ignorance
in the small community of Athena.

16
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,958
I ask the justice system

17
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:31,125
to identify and arrest
these criminal officers

18
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,458
in the name of one
of France's great families,

19
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:38,083
a family who fought for our country.

20
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:42,458
Idir's grandfather
was an Algerian Fusilier.

21
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:49,000
Abdel recently returned from Mali
with many medals.

22
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,250
At the request of Idir's family,

23
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:57,167
a complaint will be filed shortly…

24
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:07,875
Stop!

25
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:09,833
I said stop!

26
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,875
Where's Karim?

27
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,042
Get off me!

28
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,458
Stop this madness!

29
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,708
Karim!

30
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:42,667
Find the weapons!

31
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,417
Come on!

32
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,167
Stop shooting!

33
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,792
We're the police now!

34
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,875
Fucking dirty feds!

35
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:09,000
Find the weapons!

36
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:14,625
We're the police, we're the police…

37
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,625
Karim, we found the safe!

38
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,292
This way.

39
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,667
-Open it!
-We ain't got no tools.

40
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,958
Let's take it!

41
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:34,583
-Take it all, even the helmets!
-Found the flash balls!

42
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:39,042
Give it to 'em!

43
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,750
Karim, I found the car park!

44
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:48,375
This way!

45
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:53,250
Bring the safe!

46
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,417
Cover them!

47
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,625
Hold up!

48
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,208
When they get here, we bounce!

49
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,792
Go!

50
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,000
Get in!

51
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,458
Floor it!

52
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,417
Go!

53
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:36,167
Faster!

54
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,667
We fucked you up!

55
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:53,458
Get back to the 'hood!

56
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:36,917
Athena!

57
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,583
That's how it's done!

58
00:06:58,583 --> 00:06:59,708
Get down!

59
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,458
Grab this, fam. Come on!

60
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:05,125
Quick!

61
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:08,417
Go to Block 3 with the others!

62
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,042
Got a smoke?

63
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,333
Not now.

64
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,917
We gonna win this war!

65
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,583
We gonna fuck 'em up!

66
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:25,042
Rachid, tell 'em
we're on our way. Call 'em!

67
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,750
Almost there. Be ready!

68
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,000
We nicked their shit!

69
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,458
Gimme that!

70
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:36,958
Fifou ain't answerin'!

71
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,542
Higher!

72
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:45,417
To the right!

73
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,542
Let 'em know it's us!

74
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,708
Are they fucking dumb?

75
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:59,250
We're not feds, you fucks!

76
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,958
Torch the van!

77
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:05,333
It's Karim! Open up!

78
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:10,792
This is dope! Even the siren works!

79
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,417
See the tracksuits I got?

80
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,917
We're like an army now.

81
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,250
It's like our uniform!

82
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:25,042
They won't be able to tell us apart!
We nicked 'em from the football club.

83
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:29,292
Tell 'em to hurl shit faster!
Don't wait for me.

84
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,625
Grabbed some walkie-talkies.

85
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:35,250
We're a real team. Like an army!

86
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:39,792
We got another 30 tracksuits.
They're dope!

87
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:43,042
Take that to the lobby.

88
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,708
Can't we get any peace?

89
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:51,500
Leave! We can't take it!

90
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,750
Karim, I'm sorry for your loss.

91
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:59,292
Thank you. Please stay inside.
Close the windows. Don't come out.

92
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:05,833
Knock it off! Put the safe in the cellar!
Crack it open with a power saw!

93
00:09:06,792 --> 00:09:09,292
-Ready?
-Aim for my body, not my head.

94
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,125
Let's see if this works.

95
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,958
Live from the Athena estate.

96
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:17,208
We beat up the feds!

97
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:20,417
Lil' demo of our police gear.

98
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,958
-Shoot!
-Ready or not?

99
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,917
Did it hurt? Did you like it?

100
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,333
-Ya did, right?
-Fuck off!

101
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:42,792
Athena! Athena! Athena!

102
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,667
Are you dumb?

103
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,208
Think this is a game?

104
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:49,125
It's war till we get those feds' names.

105
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:54,042
-We ain't playin'!
-Clock's tickin'.

106
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,125
Cheers!

107
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
How old?

108
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:22,542
Four.

109
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:24,417
Twin girls.

110
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,292
Put your gloves on.

111
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,375
Gentlemen, you have the plans.

112
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,917
You can see the main blocks

113
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:41,250
built around a central courtyard
over a main road.

114
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,000
Traffic is now cut off.

115
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:46,042
Barricades block all entrances.

116
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:51,000
We intend to weaken them.
We launch a synchronised attack at dusk.

117
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,958
The youths may have firearms.

118
00:11:54,542 --> 00:11:56,542
Stay alert.

119
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,417
Any questions? No?

120
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,375
Let's go!

121
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:18,667
Live from the Athena estate.

122
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:24,667
Police fear the presence of Sébastien L,
a man on the terrorist watch list.

123
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,833
"…the truth should come to light."

124
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:32,875
"Chaos won't stop
until the officers in the video are ID'd."

125
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,500
We hit two by two!

126
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:42,625
Faster!

127
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,208
No wonder kids show you no respect.

128
00:14:07,292 --> 00:14:09,667
Shit's goin' south outside.

129
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,500
You stash your gear,
pick it up the next day.

130
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:17,208
Come and go as you please.
Take your shoes off!

131
00:14:17,292 --> 00:14:20,375
-Moktar?
-He ain't even listenin'!

132
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:24,250
You didn't even notice
the new welcome mat!

133
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,833
-Where's the rest?
-What?

134
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:29,500
The coke, darlin'. Where is it?

135
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,708
-In the toilet!
-Shit place to hide it.

136
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:36,000
Go! In the tank?

137
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,833
Thieving off me now? Stupid fat bitch.

138
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:43,958
Get a move on!

139
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:46,000
Guy thinks this is a holiday.

140
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:51,333
We'll be at the barrier 
with the ambulance in five.

141
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:55,375
-Tell your boys we're evacuating someone.
-Copy that.

142
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,417
We'll link up later, you know the spot.

143
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:05,000
Lil' fuck scared me!

144
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,458
You lot are pissin' me off!

145
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:08,375
Go!

146
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:14,000
Move it, dickhead!

147
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,625
What's your deal?

148
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,875
Hurry!

149
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,000
-Got the shovels.
-Nice one!

150
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,000
-We got the guns.
-Where we going?

151
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:37,292
My narc contact is waiting to let us out.

152
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:40,958
Bury this in the woods
till this shithole calms down.

153
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:42,375
The heat is on!

154
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,917
What the fuck is this?

155
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,875
-What the hell?
-Your brother wants to pass.

156
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,000
No one leaves.

157
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:59,500
You kids need to stop this bullshit.
Want every fed in the county here?

158
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,833
You can't pass. No one leaves.

159
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:04,292
Fuck!

160
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:08,208
Get outta here! The feds!

161
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:14,583
Head to the shisha bar.
We'll stash this there.

162
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:18,458
Go, go, go!

163
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,708
Go upstairs!

164
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,708
Fucking move!

165
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:30,542
Outta my way!

166
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:35,583
Let me pass.
Shut the fuck up. Guys, chill!

167
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,833
Calm the fuck down!

168
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,500
Across the square. Don't stop!

169
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:48,833
There's Moktar!

170
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,750
They can't hold us up. Chop chop!

171
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,333
They're harmless. Let 'em yap!

172
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,167
What's in the bags?

173
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,958
-The fuck you want?
-What's in the bags?

174
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:11,167
Who you talking to?

175
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,708
Fuck you!

176
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:15,333
Motherfucker!

177
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:18,750
What's in the bag?

178
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:21,375
Give us the bags!

179
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,750
The bags, the bags…

180
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,333
I'll fucking bag your mum!

181
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:30,333
-Get the fuck outta here!
-Hurry up!

182
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:31,708
Cross!

183
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,958
-Open the door!
-What's up?

184
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,333
Chill! What the fuck?

185
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,500
Fuck you all!

186
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,417
What is this?

187
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,833
You're either with us or against us.

188
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:59,417
Karim, don't play this game with me.
This ain't the way.

189
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,792
Says you!

190
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,417
I'm protecting my business.

191
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,750
-Idir's dead, and you talk business?
-Tell your boys to move!

192
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,667
Got guns in those bags?

193
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:17,250
Think you're hard? I ain't scared of you.

194
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,375
Give me the guns.

195
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,000
Shut the fuck up!

196
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,917
I mean it. Give me the guns!

197
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:33,208
-The feds are comin'!
-Head to the roof of B7!

198
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,208
This ain't over. Leave and you die!

199
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,625
Sheikh, it's crazy outside.

200
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:48,583
We need to dampen the youth's fire.
We should ask for calm.

201
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:51,833
If this fire becomes a blaze,
we can't fight it.

202
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:54,667
They threw a Molotov indoors.

203
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,333
A fire broke out.
We put it out. Alhamdulillah.

204
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:00,583
We should evacuate the families.

205
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:03,750
-Lions calm their cubs.
-These cubs are wild!

206
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,750
Give the metaphors a rest.

207
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:10,167
When are you gonna get it?
These kids are savage!

208
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,917
They hit me with a crowbar!

209
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,542
They looted the police station!

210
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:20,667
Do we wait it out?
Wait for someone to die?

211
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,958
Calm down.

212
00:19:22,042 --> 00:19:25,833
Evacuate thousands? What if some refuse?

213
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:29,417
Leave anyone mad enough to wanna stay!

214
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,667
Please calm down.

215
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:36,042
Talk to him! His brother's their leader.

216
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,083
Family of thugs!

217
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:39,917
No one touches him!

218
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,500
Calm down. Abdel, should we evacuate?

219
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,542
We listen to oppressors now?

220
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,750
Evacuate the vulnerable first.

221
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:53,167
-I'll find Karim and reason with him.
-You'd better!

222
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,458
Find and isolate Sébastien. He's a threat.

223
00:19:57,542 --> 00:20:01,500
Go and evacuate the families calmly.

224
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,333
-Let's do this.
-Start with B9.

225
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:08,792
If you see any youngsters,
bring them along.

226
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:14,458
Saber, help Abdel find his brother.

227
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:19,208
And if you see Sébastien,
get him outta here. Go on.

228
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,917
-Start with B4.
-Jump on my bike.

229
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:36,333
Come outside, please!

230
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:54,917
Karim's phone. Leave a message.

231
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,417
I want a woman!

232
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,458
Stop!

233
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,750
See if he's at the back.

234
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,125
Karim!

235
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,708
Stop! They'll gun you down. Where's Karim?

236
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:18,042
Dunno!

237
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:25,125
Stop shooting!
We're letting the families leave!

238
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:33,917
You can't stay.

239
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,667
Don't tell me what to do!

240
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:43,000
You can't stay here, madam.

241
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:45,583
See him?

242
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,167
Go to B7.

243
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:52,458
Follow the kids!

244
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,417
Slow down!

245
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,125
There's Sébastien.

246
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:09,958
What do we do?

247
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,458
We're taking the families somewhere quiet.
Come with us.

248
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,000
We gotta go now!

249
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,917
Please. It's gonna be okay.

250
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,250
This way.

251
00:22:50,042 --> 00:22:51,750
No! To the daycare!

252
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,625
Stop! There are families coming through!

253
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:05,250
Calm down.

254
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:18,042
Come this way.

255
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:23,750
Go!

256
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:34,042
-Hurry up, kids.
-You have to leave, madam.

257
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:38,167
-Anyone left inside?
-No.

258
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,292
Sit here.

259
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,458
You'll be fine. We'll be back.

260
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:52,125
Close the curtains.

261
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:56,875
I locked up.

262
00:23:56,958 --> 00:24:01,333
Stay put. I'll see if Karim's home.
Don't let him leave.

263
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:27,542
What you doing here?

264
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,292
You can't stay!

265
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:34,875
We're with you.

266
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:38,167
Be strong.

267
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,708
Sorry for your loss.

268
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,125
My condolences.

269
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:48,625
It'll be okay. Stay strong.

270
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:58,875
-Where's Karim?
-What do you care?

271
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:01,375
-Pray for Idir.
-Mum, you can't stay.

272
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,917
-Take this off. Go pray.
-Please.

273
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,750
-Pray for your brother.
-Okay, then we go.

274
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:31,875
Everyone leave, please.
You're not safe here.

275
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:35,500
Help me. Evacuate calmly.

276
00:26:36,792 --> 00:26:38,292
Quickly.

277
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:41,875
Quickly but calmly.

278
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:06,167
Where's Karim?

279
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:10,208
Where's Mum? I'm talking to you!

280
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:14,042
-She's in the convoy.
-Go and help her!

281
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:16,292
Aren't you the soldier?

282
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:19,083
-We'll talk later.
-I'm staying!

283
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:22,000
What? Still like obeying orders?

284
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:24,875
-After what they did?
-Nonsense.

285
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:28,083
-Why not let it burn?
-Shut up!

286
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:31,708
You don't want it to burn
or to start a war, not here.

287
00:27:31,792 --> 00:27:34,375
The war has started.

288
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:36,542
That's right, fuck off!

289
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,833
Abdel, where you going?

290
00:27:49,917 --> 00:27:52,125
Come join us!

291
00:27:59,042 --> 00:28:00,250
What's the hold-up?

292
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:06,833
Calm her down.

293
00:28:10,292 --> 00:28:12,583
This is all your fault!

294
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:15,167
You're gonna drop me!

295
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,917
You're useless!

296
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,208
Letting kids take over.

297
00:28:21,292 --> 00:28:22,458
Help us out!

298
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:26,875
You can't even tame them. Useless shits!

299
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:28,333
Thank you, fam.

300
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:18,292
Mum!

301
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:22,458
-Where were you?
-Go to Aunt Myriam's.

302
00:29:22,542 --> 00:29:25,167
-Where's Karim?
-He is safe.

303
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,375
-He isn't coming?
-He'll be in the next convoy.

304
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:29,833
He's fragile.

305
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:32,375
Be there for him.

306
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:46,000
Keep it moving! Everyone out!

307
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:48,583
Careful. Stop pushing!

308
00:29:49,917 --> 00:29:53,250
-Out of the way!
-Easy now!

309
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:19,292
ATHENA: URBAN WARFARE

310
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:22,167
You two, pick that up!

311
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:25,000
Go on! Hurry!

312
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:33,083
To the left!

313
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:34,792
Hold it…

314
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:35,875
Now!

315
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:51,750
Turn around!

316
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,542
Shield!

317
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:57,833
Fall back!

318
00:31:05,958 --> 00:31:07,250
Look out!

319
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:11,125
I'm pissin' on you pigs! Fuck you!

320
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:15,167
I'm pissing on the feds!
They can't do shit!

321
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:29,250
Break into flats. Grab what you can.

322
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:34,083
We got your back.

323
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:48,667
Karim, it's Mum. I'm worried.
I can't get hold of you. Are you okay?

324
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:53,125
Be careful, darling. Call me back.

325
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:10,208
…an outburst of violence,
triggered by a video

326
00:32:10,292 --> 00:32:12,833
that's gone viral on social media

327
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:17,625
showing Idir, 13,
being restrained by three officers.

328
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:21,250
He is brutally beaten
and left for dead.

329
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:23,708
In a dramatic turn of events,

330
00:32:23,792 --> 00:32:27,583
sources claim the attackers
may not have been officers,

331
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:33,458
but far-right extremists
aiming to aggravate recent tension…

332
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,458
Feds breakin' into B1!

333
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:37,875
Follow me!

334
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:57,750
Get off me!

335
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,625
Push the dumpsters!

336
00:34:38,792 --> 00:34:40,083
Ram it!

337
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,000
Retreat!

338
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:53,875
Sorry you got arrested.
I'm embarrassed to have to uncuff you.

339
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:57,000
Let them go. They wanted to help.

340
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:08,417
If I could, I'd free them.
Once in custody, it's all red tape.

341
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:12,583
I issued a report
to find out who did what.

342
00:36:13,292 --> 00:36:14,958
Such a scandal.

343
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:18,667
Scandal over casualties?

344
00:36:20,292 --> 00:36:21,958
Let me talk to them.

345
00:36:22,042 --> 00:36:25,417
The raid's about to begin.
No one in or out.

346
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,167
The commander's waiting.

347
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:32,000
I need you here. You're not under arrest.

348
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:23,042
-Sarcelles here to help!
-Tarterêts!

349
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:25,167
-Les Pyramides!
-Tremblay!

350
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,708
-Bosquets!
-Bobigny!

351
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:28,375
This isn't a victory!

352
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:31,417
They'll be back to fuck us up!

353
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,958
We want Idir's killers.

354
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:38,083
We ain't just thugs torchin' shit!

355
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:41,958
Socials and the news say
they might not be feds.

356
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:42,917
Says who?

357
00:37:43,542 --> 00:37:47,042
Since when do we trust
socials or the news?

358
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:52,125
We're done bein' seen as victims!

359
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,250
When they strike,

360
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:57,583
we strike back!

361
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,792
When they kill,

362
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:01,917
we kill!

363
00:38:04,917 --> 00:38:06,708
They talk about unrest?

364
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:10,458
We'll show 'em unrest!

365
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,333
I got a plan.

366
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:17,958
We snatch a fed.

367
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,250
Then they'll have to listen to us.

368
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:25,875
Athena!

369
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:47,125
Unit, halt!

370
00:39:59,708 --> 00:40:00,833
March on!

371
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,292
Single file!

372
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:11,458
Officer down!

373
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:15,333
Charge!

374
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:45,250
Got him! Fall back!

375
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:00,500
Hold the line!

376
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:03,500
Everyone, fall back!

377
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:37,583
-Got one here!
-Catch him!

378
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,792
Get him!

379
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,958
Where is he?

380
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:56,875
You can't hide!

381
00:44:58,125 --> 00:45:00,417
We find you, you're dead!

382
00:47:10,458 --> 00:47:11,792
It's him!

383
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,417
Get back!

384
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:19,250
You too! I'll kill you!

385
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,958
We need to stand firm

386
00:47:39,042 --> 00:47:42,792
and to not let these thugs
burn our city down.

387
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:44,875
Very well, but how?

388
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:48,500
Boost funding for manpower and equipment.

389
00:47:48,583 --> 00:47:54,208
These are lawless neighbourhoods,
ruled by dealers and fundamentalists.

390
00:47:54,292 --> 00:47:58,917
Order must be restored.
Our laws must apply.

391
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,250
We need to rearm the police,
morally and materially.

392
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:06,292
In those neighbourhoods,

393
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:10,458
we've funded useless organisations

394
00:48:10,542 --> 00:48:14,375
to avoid these uprisings.

395
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,500
But they happen anyway. Why?

396
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:20,917
These neighbourhoods
are becoming no-go areas.

397
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,208
The military is just one solution.

398
00:48:23,292 --> 00:48:27,375
The way you speak is shocking.
"Us" and "them".

399
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:30,958
We are all the same. We are one society.

400
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:42,292
We've been stuck here for hours.
Pick us up!

401
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:44,958
-Access was refused.
-What?

402
00:48:45,042 --> 00:48:47,375
-Plan's fucked.
-"Fucked"?

403
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:50,667
Shut up! It's not fucked!

404
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,958
You do this, you'll be fucked!

405
00:48:53,042 --> 00:48:57,750
Guy's diggin' a hole to China!

406
00:48:57,833 --> 00:49:00,750
Play your part or I'll give the kids guns!

407
00:49:00,833 --> 00:49:03,292
I'll turn this place into Sarajevo!

408
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:05,708
Keep fucking playin' me!

409
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:10,958
Keep diggin'! Did I say stop?
Big, fat fuck!

410
00:49:14,125 --> 00:49:15,250
Look at the camera.

411
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:18,167
For those murdered by the police,

412
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:24,042
we demand Idir's murderers
be identified and given life sentences.

413
00:49:24,792 --> 00:49:27,958
We stand firm. If our demands are not met…

414
00:49:28,042 --> 00:49:29,500
Know the location?

415
00:49:29,583 --> 00:49:30,625
…he dies.

416
00:49:37,417 --> 00:49:40,958
Does their location appear on this map?

417
00:49:45,292 --> 00:49:46,958
Your co-operation is vital.

418
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,542
We don't want more casualties.

419
00:49:50,208 --> 00:49:52,167
Reason with your brother.

420
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:56,292
I'll go and get him back.

421
00:49:57,292 --> 00:49:59,708
If you send the cavalry, it'll get ugly.

422
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:09,000
The tactical unit will talk to you.
Just give them some site intel.

423
00:50:12,292 --> 00:50:13,292
Thank you.

424
00:50:14,167 --> 00:50:18,333
We'll find whoever did this,
be they cops or not.

425
00:50:19,375 --> 00:50:20,500
We need time.

426
00:50:24,917 --> 00:50:25,917
Want a coffee?

427
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,125
Thank you.

428
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,333
Where you going?

429
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,625
Come back!

430
00:52:09,958 --> 00:52:11,750
A fed! Fuck him up!

431
00:52:12,292 --> 00:52:14,333
It's Karim's brother!

432
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,917
Abdel's joined our movement!

433
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,917
Abdel is with us! Abdel is with us!

434
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,833
Block the entrance!

435
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:50,417
Karim's phone. Leave a message.

436
00:53:18,292 --> 00:53:22,125
-Abdel! What you doin'?
-Shut your mouth!

437
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,875
It's your brother. What do I do?

438
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,500
Break time's over.

439
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:38,083
You'll go down for years,
if they don't shoot you first.

440
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:40,042
I'm takin' the cop.

441
00:53:40,792 --> 00:53:41,625
What the hell?

442
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:43,458
-Name?
-Jérôme.

443
00:53:43,542 --> 00:53:45,875
Let's get you outta here.

444
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:47,333
What you doin'?

445
00:53:47,417 --> 00:53:51,792
You don't get it.
They want this mayhem. Let it go.

446
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:53,958
No, you don't get it.

447
00:53:54,042 --> 00:53:58,042
They won't tell us who killed Idir.
I ain't letting shit go!

448
00:54:00,833 --> 00:54:01,917
Won't let go?

449
00:54:05,125 --> 00:54:06,833
You get the names, then what?

450
00:54:09,167 --> 00:54:10,583
Will it bring Idir back?

451
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:17,042
What's done is done.

452
00:54:18,292 --> 00:54:19,292
He's dead.

453
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:25,167
Please come with me, brother. Come home.

454
00:54:28,167 --> 00:54:29,292
Come with me.

455
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:33,875
Think about Mum.

456
00:54:36,542 --> 00:54:39,125
She's suffered enough, miskina.

457
00:54:40,042 --> 00:54:41,042
Get off!

458
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:45,667
Traitor! You fight for them, you harki!

459
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,833
Don't play my big bro.
You're a military whore for France!

460
00:54:58,917 --> 00:55:01,208
I don't even know you.

461
00:55:01,792 --> 00:55:04,458
You should've died, not Idir!

462
00:55:13,042 --> 00:55:14,333
I know.

463
00:55:16,167 --> 00:55:17,500
What you doin'?

464
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:20,667
I'm talking to you!

465
00:55:21,917 --> 00:55:23,333
Follow me.

466
00:55:23,417 --> 00:55:26,125
Don't let 'em get away!

467
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:27,542
To your right!

468
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:36,667
This way!

469
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:44,792
The door!

470
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
This way!

471
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:13,083
Police! Stop! On the ground!

472
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:18,667
Stop shooting! He's one of you!

473
00:56:38,958 --> 00:56:40,417
Come on!

474
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:55,875
They're over here!

475
00:57:05,167 --> 00:57:07,625
Open up! It's Abdel!

476
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:10,000
Open it!

477
00:57:10,917 --> 00:57:12,083
Open the door!

478
00:57:14,667 --> 00:57:15,750
Get in!

479
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,542
Any closer, I'll shoot you!

480
00:57:29,917 --> 00:57:34,083
Motherfuckers! I'll tear you a new one!

481
00:57:36,667 --> 00:57:38,292
Yeah, come on!

482
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:39,458
Bastards!

483
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,583
Keep running! Little bitches!

484
00:57:51,417 --> 00:57:52,417
Well?

485
00:57:53,958 --> 00:57:56,250
When you got scared after school,

486
00:57:56,333 --> 00:57:58,542
you'd run to me for protection.

487
00:57:58,625 --> 00:58:00,417
Good to see you, lil' bro.

488
00:58:01,417 --> 00:58:02,583
Missed you.

489
00:58:05,875 --> 00:58:09,833
Can't you reason with our brother?
They've gone wild.

490
00:58:09,917 --> 00:58:14,292
Forget about it.
This new generation is fucked.

491
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,292
Got another exit?

492
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:22,083
Fuck, Idir…

493
00:58:24,208 --> 00:58:28,958
I barely knew him. The fuckers
took him from me. Give me a hug.

494
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:34,042
We're family. It's all we got.

495
00:58:34,125 --> 00:58:35,750
Never let go.

496
00:58:36,917 --> 00:58:41,375
Fuck… We're family, united.
That can't ever change.

497
00:58:42,167 --> 00:58:46,333
Even if we have different dads
or it takes war for you to come,

498
00:58:46,417 --> 00:58:48,958
you're my flesh and blood!

499
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:52,750
-Feel me?
-Is there another exit?

500
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:57,458
There's my GI Joe!

501
00:58:57,542 --> 00:58:59,958
A door at the back. We blocked it.

502
00:59:14,542 --> 00:59:15,542
Who's this?

503
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:18,750
That's the fed on TV!

504
00:59:18,833 --> 00:59:20,917
Everyone's after him!

505
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,083
I'm getting him out.

506
00:59:24,042 --> 00:59:25,958
You brought a fed here?

507
00:59:30,625 --> 00:59:34,500
Keep diggin', dickhead! No time to stop!

508
00:59:36,292 --> 00:59:37,292
You okay?

509
00:59:39,958 --> 00:59:43,417
You mad? He saw our guns, our faces.

510
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,500
Dig deeper. I waste him, we bury him here.

511
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,250
Or you save his life and you're a hero.

512
00:59:52,125 --> 00:59:53,333
Me? A hero?

513
00:59:56,083 --> 00:59:59,583
Who's that? More feds?
I don't give a fuck!

514
01:00:17,292 --> 01:00:20,500
Fine, we get him out, but my way.

515
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,333
My narcs will come and get him.

516
01:00:31,167 --> 01:00:35,458
Yeah? Sorry about earlier,
got carried away.

517
01:00:36,375 --> 01:00:39,875
I think I found
a way out of our situation.

518
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:43,000
You guys wanna be heroes?

519
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,708
We'll get you out. Don't worry.

520
01:00:45,792 --> 01:00:46,708
When?

521
01:00:49,083 --> 01:00:51,833
-About ten minutes.
-That works.

522
01:00:59,375 --> 01:01:00,833
Problem solved.

523
01:01:01,667 --> 01:01:06,833
Okay, big guy?
Must be hungry. Twix?

524
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:12,167
Take it. I got Yop.
Raspberry, strawberry…

525
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:16,542
The strawberry one's smaller.
Want the lil' one?

526
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:21,125
You shy? He's shy. Big guys don't cry!

527
01:01:22,667 --> 01:01:26,583
He's looks like a child. You babysit him.

528
01:01:37,917 --> 01:01:41,583
We can't attack.
Your brothers are in there.

529
01:01:41,667 --> 01:01:43,375
They ain't my brothers no more.

530
01:01:43,458 --> 01:01:45,167
We'll smoke 'em out.

531
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,375
Hi, Mum.

532
01:02:07,625 --> 01:02:09,958
Don't worry. Be home soon.

533
01:02:14,625 --> 01:02:15,625
Sorry.

534
01:02:21,542 --> 01:02:22,750
I love you, Mum.

535
01:02:38,542 --> 01:02:39,625
Use this.

536
01:02:40,708 --> 01:02:45,458
Knock down the back wall.
I'll be out front. Bring me the fed.

537
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:48,750
-What about the chopper?
-Don't give a fuck.

538
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:07,792
Hand over the fed!

539
01:03:08,292 --> 01:03:10,792
The riot squad will see you!

540
01:03:10,875 --> 01:03:15,000
I don't give a shit!
Let 'em come. I want the fed!

541
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:17,333
It's too late. Go!

542
01:03:17,417 --> 01:03:19,875
-Hand him over or burn!
-Go!

543
01:03:19,958 --> 01:03:22,125
I'll kill you all!

544
01:03:22,208 --> 01:03:24,333
My narcs are comin'.

545
01:03:24,417 --> 01:03:28,417
-You trust them?
-They're safe. Tell him to scram!

546
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:29,917
He's fucking everything up!

547
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,417
You can't stay here. They're coming.

548
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,167
I'll torch this place!

549
01:03:34,667 --> 01:03:35,958
It's too late!

550
01:03:36,458 --> 01:03:40,250
-Think I'm playin'?
-What you doing? Stop!

551
01:03:40,333 --> 01:03:44,708
Bring him out or I'll torch it!

552
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,458
Hello? Hold on a sec. Coming!

553
01:03:51,542 --> 01:03:54,167
-Put it out!
-Hand him over!

554
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:56,750
-Don't push me!
-Put it out!

555
01:03:59,458 --> 01:04:03,250
What you doin' here?
What the fuck have you done?

556
01:04:03,333 --> 01:04:06,625
-Don't force me.
-It's over.

557
01:04:07,417 --> 01:04:10,500
-Put it out!
-On the count of three.

558
01:04:15,708 --> 01:04:17,417
It's too late.

559
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:21,417
-Stop it!
-Don't push me.

560
01:04:22,583 --> 01:04:25,208
-Police!
-Put down the Molotov!

561
01:04:25,292 --> 01:04:30,083
-Drop your weapon! I'll shoot!
-On the ground!

562
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:33,625
Stop!

563
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:34,958
Get down!

564
01:04:36,417 --> 01:04:39,708
Get down! I said get down!

565
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:55,167
Be brave, brother.

566
01:07:55,917 --> 01:07:57,875
It ain't your fault.

567
01:08:00,292 --> 01:08:02,958
Gotta get rid of the guns.
Too dangerous.

568
01:08:10,292 --> 01:08:13,000
Too many kids here. We gotta go.

569
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,750
You can save 'em all.

570
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,500
Anyone wants out…

571
01:09:52,417 --> 01:09:53,583
now's the time.

572
01:09:57,917 --> 01:09:59,250
Put down your weapons.

573
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:24,000
Go through the building.

574
01:10:24,708 --> 01:10:26,250
Break down the walls.

575
01:10:26,917 --> 01:10:28,250
Get the guns.

576
01:10:34,917 --> 01:10:36,125
Close the shutter!

577
01:10:39,542 --> 01:10:41,167
We'll show you!

578
01:10:44,208 --> 01:10:48,208
Gonna chop your finger off!

579
01:10:50,958 --> 01:10:52,708
Chop his finger off!

580
01:10:52,792 --> 01:10:55,042
-I didn't do anything.
-Shut up!

581
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:56,583
Shut the fuck up!

582
01:10:59,042 --> 01:11:03,125
What's going on? I said to stay put!

583
01:11:03,208 --> 01:11:07,167
Some dirty cops barged in.
It wasn't our call.

584
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:12,125
We need proof our officer is alive.
I feel your pain…

585
01:11:14,292 --> 01:11:18,667
-Bring him upstairs.
-You heard him! Move it!

586
01:11:48,792 --> 01:11:51,875
Come quick. We got a situation.

587
01:12:02,167 --> 01:12:03,417
Right here.

588
01:12:10,042 --> 01:12:12,042
What do we do with him?

589
01:12:16,542 --> 01:12:18,583
We blocked all entry.

590
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:21,542
Couldn't crack this. There's guns inside.

591
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,083
Help 'em out.

592
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:57,458
Gather any fireworks,
gas tanks and petrol.

593
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:01,375
You, sister,

594
01:13:02,667 --> 01:13:04,083
get me a fruit juice.

595
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:07,083
Carry on.

596
01:13:34,333 --> 01:13:35,542
You'll pay for this!

597
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:37,000
It's all your fault!

598
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:39,750
We'll burn your 'hoods to the ground!

599
01:13:43,667 --> 01:13:47,000
We're worried. How can I help?

600
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:52,208
I want the cops who killed Idir.

601
01:13:53,042 --> 01:13:54,750
Within the hour, or he dies.

602
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:56,375
Calm down.

603
01:13:58,125 --> 01:14:00,958
Put it on Snap. Pile the pressure on!

604
01:14:02,083 --> 01:14:04,208
…the situation is out of hand.

605
01:14:04,292 --> 01:14:09,833
24 hours after the video 
of the fatal assault of Idir  leaked,

606
01:14:09,917 --> 01:14:12,417
all of France is in turmoil.

607
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:16,958
Thirty cities are experiencing
unprecedented violence.

608
01:14:17,042 --> 01:14:22,750
Police stations have been ransacked,
mosques set ablaze.

609
01:14:24,917 --> 01:14:31,125
A large far-right group
just stormed Dijon town hall.

610
01:14:31,208 --> 01:14:36,042
Police forces throughout France
are overwhelmed.

611
01:14:36,125 --> 01:14:41,708
Sources say 
the army will soon be deployed.

612
01:14:41,792 --> 01:14:43,583
Sorry about your brothers.

613
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:53,792
Chaos reigns
as hundreds of youths storm the area.

614
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:57,958
I need help. This family won't leave.

615
01:15:59,167 --> 01:16:01,250
Fuck! What do we do?

616
01:16:12,833 --> 01:16:13,833
Watch him.

617
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:32,667
-Who told you to shoot?
-Sébastien. So they can't retaliate.

618
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:33,750
Where is he?

619
01:16:33,833 --> 01:16:35,833
Settin' up the gas tanks.

620
01:16:41,292 --> 01:16:44,375
No one stays! Go!

621
01:16:54,333 --> 01:16:55,458
Get out!

622
01:16:56,375 --> 01:17:00,542
-What's goin' on?
-This is my home! I won't leave!

623
01:17:00,625 --> 01:17:02,375
What are you doing?

624
01:17:03,167 --> 01:17:04,750
Let go of my dad!

625
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:08,167
Take your kids and go!

626
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:10,000
Stop filming!

627
01:17:12,083 --> 01:17:13,500
Sébastien!

628
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,917
Do that on every floor.

629
01:17:29,417 --> 01:17:30,417
Gas tank!

630
01:17:39,583 --> 01:17:40,750
Gas tank!

631
01:17:40,833 --> 01:17:41,833
Petrol!

632
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,167
Sébastien!

633
01:18:34,875 --> 01:18:40,667
We're evacuating the last families.
Just you and the youths left. Surrender.

634
01:18:41,625 --> 01:18:44,042
-You find 'em?
-Who?

635
01:18:46,167 --> 01:18:48,250
They're not police!

636
01:18:50,333 --> 01:18:51,333
Bring 'em.

637
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:53,792
I wanna see 'em.

638
01:18:54,417 --> 01:18:56,542
We think it's a far-right group.

639
01:18:56,625 --> 01:18:59,250
They aren't our men. It's over.

640
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:03,000
-Bring 'em, or I do him.
-You aren't hearing me!

641
01:19:04,042 --> 01:19:06,875
Bring them to me!

642
01:19:07,875 --> 01:19:11,375
We don't know where they're from.

643
01:19:11,458 --> 01:19:13,625
Calm down!

644
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:19,708
The tactical unit is coming…

645
01:19:19,792 --> 01:19:20,792
I'll kill him!

646
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:24,833
I'll kill him.

647
01:20:10,417 --> 01:20:13,708
We set up all the gas tanks. Now what?

648
01:20:49,333 --> 01:20:51,917
-What's going on?
-Film.

649
01:20:56,208 --> 01:20:57,708
That's enough!

650
01:20:57,792 --> 01:21:02,833
-You bringing 'em, yes or no?
-Now isn't the time to lose it!

651
01:21:02,917 --> 01:21:06,542
-Please! Spare me!
-What the hell?

652
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:10,417
-Abdel!
-Bring 'em to me. Yes or no?

653
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:13,917
-I'm begging you!
-Let him live!

654
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,125
You bringing 'em, yes or no?

655
01:21:18,208 --> 01:21:22,042
No! They're not police, okay?

656
01:21:22,125 --> 01:21:23,500
Let him go!

657
01:21:23,583 --> 01:21:26,417
Stop! It's pointless!

658
01:21:28,375 --> 01:21:32,000
Stop, Abdel! What the fuck? Don't do it!

659
01:21:32,083 --> 01:21:34,583
Please, I beg you!

660
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:50,000
Sébastien's gone mental!
He wants to blow up the block!

661
