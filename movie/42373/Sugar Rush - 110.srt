1
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:07,260
- Allo ?
- Kiz...

2
00:00:08,362 --> 00:00:10,867
I need you. Please.

3
00:00:11,651 --> 00:00:13,015
I'm in deep shit.

4
00:01:05,413 --> 00:01:06,413
<i>The things we do for love...</i>

5
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:11,530
<i>Like standing up a fit girl
I could have a decent chat with... and a snog...</i>

6
00:01:11,764 --> 00:01:16,307
<i>... for a slapper who treated me like shit and
only snogged me to turn on the loser guys.</i>

7
00:01:23,502 --> 00:01:26,014
Look, you better not be pissing me about, OK ?

8
00:01:41,816 --> 00:01:42,730
Oh my god.

9
00:01:46,746 --> 00:01:48,869
OK, what's happened ?

10
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:50,882
Shh, calm down.

11
00:01:53,562 --> 00:01:55,528
I'm gonna tidy you up a bit, allright ?

12
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,581
And when you're ready, tell me what happened ?

13
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:01,824
I've gotta go.

14
00:02:03,027 --> 00:02:03,540
I've gotta go !

15
00:02:03,815 --> 00:02:06,433
You're not going anywhere like this, OK ?

16
00:02:07,097 --> 00:02:08,831
I've stabbed someone, alright ?

17
00:02:23,696 --> 00:02:25,551
- How much money have you got ?
- A tenner.

18
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:27,911
We're gonna need more. Much more.

19
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:29,240
Shit.

20
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:34,022
<i>It wasn't I didn't have
ten million questions about the stabbing thing,</i>

21
00:02:34,127 --> 00:02:37,261
<i>it's just that having a project
seemed to be calming her down.</i>

22
00:02:54,696 --> 00:02:58,891
<i>And gradually the scared girl I found
under the peer started to look like Sugar again.</i>

23
00:02:58,905 --> 00:03:00,323
Alright, how much have we got ?

24
00:03:00,385 --> 00:03:02,120
Nothing, just a couple of quid.

25
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:05,202
- Did you get anything else ?
- No.

26
00:03:05,207 --> 00:03:07,973
For fuck's sake, Kizzer ! I'm in trouble, allright ?

27
00:03:08,157 --> 00:03:10,503
You could at least make the effort. Fuck.

28
00:03:11,137 --> 00:03:13,481
- I'm gonna have to care on nicking bags.
- Why ?

29
00:03:13,716 --> 00:03:16,703
Coz I've got to get out of the town.
And I can't do that on fresh air !

30
00:03:19,526 --> 00:03:19,970
Fuck !

31
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:26,002
Hey listen. Why don't you come back to mine ?
I've got some money.

32
00:03:27,465 --> 00:03:29,153
- Yeah ?
- Yeah.

33
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:36,281
- So where are you gonna go ?
- London.

34
00:03:36,808 --> 00:03:38,201
Reckon I can get lost for a while.

35
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,941
You wanna come ?

36
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:45,420
Don't worry about it. It's not your problem.

37
00:03:48,045 --> 00:03:49,301
Maybe I can help.

38
00:03:50,265 --> 00:03:51,341
The money would help.

39
00:03:58,187 --> 00:04:02,182
- I'm good at this ! Look, look...
- You've taken half an hour
over potatoes.

40
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:04,362
- Eat one bit of skin.
- Lovely.

41
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:08,250
- Darling !
- Oh, Kim, great, you're on time for dinner !

42
00:04:08,256 --> 00:04:10,801
I'm so glad you're back.
I didn't want to leave without saying goodbye.

43
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:15,421
All my shit's bringing you down, Kim.

44
00:04:16,275 --> 00:04:19,063
You said yourself. I'm no good for you.

45
00:04:20,618 --> 00:04:23,550
And I need to get to a place where I can be good for you.

46
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,741
I can't do it here.

47
00:04:30,158 --> 00:04:31,340
Sorry.

48
00:04:35,727 --> 00:04:36,662
Bye, then.

49
00:04:53,206 --> 00:04:55,382
<i>Why stick around for the boring finale...</i>

50
00:04:55,636 --> 00:04:59,331
<i>when you can co-star
on an adventure of your own?</i>

51
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:37,752
Don't forget your toothbrush.

52
00:05:44,568 --> 00:05:45,270
Let's go, then.

53
00:05:48,787 --> 00:05:49,612
Come on !

54
00:05:50,626 --> 00:05:54,432
<i>So there we were...
heroines in our very own escape movie.</i>

55
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,813
- We could get jobs, yeah ?
- Yeah, why not.

56
00:05:57,017 --> 00:05:59,671
I fancy selling thousand flowers
on a big market stall.

57
00:05:59,677 --> 00:06:00,882
Well, you're gobby enough.

58
00:06:00,887 --> 00:06:02,630
Oi ! You could sell fish.

59
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:06,362
Fuck !

60
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,942
- It's just one car.
- No.

61
00:06:14,148 --> 00:06:18,870
No, you don't understand, there'll be snipers on the roof,
helicopters stripping down, you know how it is !

62
00:06:19,306 --> 00:06:20,271
In movies...

63
00:06:20,378 --> 00:06:21,271
We're gonna get the bus.

64
00:06:22,078 --> 00:06:25,203
- You still haven't told me exactly what happened !
- There's no time !

65
00:06:34,718 --> 00:06:35,800
Is that your new girlfriend ?

66
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:37,712
I haven't got a girlfriend.

67
00:06:37,716 --> 00:06:39,462
Uh, you're all tarted up to someone.

68
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:41,033
Yeah, well there wasn't much point, was there ?

69
00:06:41,178 --> 00:06:42,993
- Oh, well piss off, then !
- No !

70
00:06:43,426 --> 00:06:45,841
You've got me here now,
wether you want me or not, OK ?

71
00:06:53,876 --> 00:06:55,380
- So where did you meet her, then ?
- Who ?

72
00:06:56,026 --> 00:06:58,030
- Oh, come on, don't go all shy on me now.
- No !

73
00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:00,801
And what's she doing with a minger like you ?

74
00:07:01,525 --> 00:07:03,883
- Ow !
- I hardly touched you.

75
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:06,741
Yeah, all right.

76
00:07:07,638 --> 00:07:08,371
Bus.

77
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:22,640
Do you know where we are ?

78
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:24,471
Fuck knows.

79
00:07:26,298 --> 00:07:29,053
It's weird how you can live somewhere
and not really know it.

80
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,852
It's like... people.

81
00:07:33,056 --> 00:07:35,773
You live with them all your life
but you don't really know who they are.

82
00:07:37,287 --> 00:07:40,503
-  Stella pissed you off again ?
- Yeah, she's pissed off for good this time.

83
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:44,163
I'm sorry.

84
00:07:45,907 --> 00:07:46,943
If... you are.

85
00:07:51,017 --> 00:07:54,232
- Look, you can go, you know. I don't mind.
- Fuck it, no !

86
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:57,943
If she can just leave, just like that,
and Nathan can just let her, without a fight,

87
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:00,282
and without a thought for me and Matt,
then why can't I ?

88
00:08:13,395 --> 00:08:15,700
I stabbed some guy with a broken bottle.

89
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:19,702
Who ?

90
00:08:22,148 --> 00:08:24,621
Don't know, just some random guy
I was fucking, innit...

91
00:08:29,298 --> 00:08:31,993
I met this really fit guy down Lost Vegas.

92
00:08:34,008 --> 00:08:38,920
We went to the beach. Fucked. Fine.

93
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:44,473
And then his mate's on me. As soon as he's finished,
his mate's on me !

94
00:08:45,895 --> 00:08:49,462
Fucking Melissa !
He was supposed to be hers, innit ?

95
00:08:49,926 --> 00:08:51,601
Yeah, and she bailed on me.

96
00:08:55,207 --> 00:08:57,173
It just hit me by surprise, that's all.

97
00:08:58,797 --> 00:09:00,041
I've never done two before.

98
00:09:01,786 --> 00:09:03,923
It's the kind of thing that a girl
needs to prepare for, right ?

99
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,502
Anyway, he was a right minger.

100
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,390
He stunk of burgers.

101
00:09:20,908 --> 00:09:23,921
And when I told him to stop
and get off and he wouldn't...

102
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:28,892
You're alright ?

103
00:09:29,616 --> 00:09:32,831
Yeah, yeah I'm fine.

104
00:09:33,557 --> 00:09:35,561
It's that poor bastard you should worry about.

105
00:09:36,006 --> 00:09:38,572
Bleeding with his pants down by his ankles.

106
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:48,842
Why are they like that with me ?

107
00:09:51,777 --> 00:09:56,502
Why does no one fall in love with me
and follow me round like Tom does with you ?

108
00:09:58,108 --> 00:09:59,603
Because they're mad.

109
00:10:02,026 --> 00:10:02,590
Yeah.

110
00:10:18,528 --> 00:10:19,862
Do you know how to steal a car ?

111
00:10:25,077 --> 00:10:25,943
Well, get in !

112
00:10:26,597 --> 00:10:29,113
<i>The way I figured it,
this town was bad for both of us.</i>

113
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,522
<i>Time to get the hell out of Dodge.</i>

114
00:10:47,556 --> 00:10:51,101
Bye-bye, Brighton! Fuck you !

115
00:10:59,895 --> 00:11:00,881
Let me have a go.

116
00:11:02,116 --> 00:11:05,902
- Don't be stupid.
- Oh, come on ! Please...

117
00:11:06,106 --> 00:11:08,942
Pretty please. I'll be your best friend.

118
00:11:10,428 --> 00:11:12,491
Jesus Christ.

119
00:11:14,788 --> 00:11:17,820
OK,  you better slow down a bit now.

120
00:11:20,028 --> 00:11:23,092
- Kim! Slow down.
- You're not scared, are you ?

121
00:11:23,146 --> 00:11:26,293
- Keep your eyes on the road !
- Come on, Shoogs.

122
00:11:26,348 --> 00:11:29,142
- You're a fast woman.
- You'll get us pulled over.

123
00:11:29,186 --> 00:11:31,781
- You want to get to London, don't you ?
- Yeah, alive.

124
00:11:33,468 --> 00:11:36,932
- You don't like it, do you ?
- Just slow the fuck down !

125
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,742
- OK ?
- Look out !

126
00:11:44,626 --> 00:11:47,903
Fucking hell, Kim !
Get out the fucking road, you nutter !

127
00:11:58,228 --> 00:12:01,770
- Shoogs, I'm sorry. But you put me off.
- Fuck off.

128
00:12:01,826 --> 00:12:03,460
-  Where are you going ?
- Away !

129
00:12:03,507 --> 00:12:06,222
- Sugar !
- Oh, just piss off back home.

130
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,902
I haven't got a home.

131
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:20,102
I should have let that guy finish off.

132
00:12:20,146 --> 00:12:21,942
Shoot his load and be done.

133
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:26,330
We could be down Lost Vegas now
having a right laugh.

134
00:12:26,385 --> 00:12:29,262
- Except it's not funny.
- Would have been.

135
00:12:29,307 --> 00:12:31,693
Me and the gruesome twosome.

136
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:34,860
- What was that for ?
- He raped you.

137
00:12:34,908 --> 00:12:37,662
- No, he didn't.
- Course he did.

138
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:41,092
I didn't go to the beach for a picnic.
I knew why I was there.

139
00:12:41,146 --> 00:12:44,021
You didn't. You never do,
you're always so out of it.

140
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:47,422
- So I'm raped every time I have sex ?
- Yeah, practically.

141
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,771
It's fucked up, Shoog, really.

142
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:53,703
Yeah, well, so is wanting to rub fannies
with other girls.

143
00:12:53,748 --> 00:12:55,861
I can't talk to you.

144
00:12:55,902 --> 00:13:00,298
- What, do you care anyway ?
- You're smart, gorgeous, funny and cool.

145
00:13:00,348 --> 00:13:03,731
You're wasting yourself on guys
who don't give a shit.

146
00:13:03,785 --> 00:13:07,544
- Well, that's my choice, innit ?
- Yes ! Yeah, it is.

147
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,823
Are we going to London, then ?

148
00:13:24,865 --> 00:13:27,980
- I don't care.
- Of course you don't care.

149
00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:33,091
You'll leave here one day.

150
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:37,021
Go to university, travel, get a good job...

151
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:39,900
marry a rich lesbian...

152
00:13:39,948 --> 00:13:41,980
live abroad, New York, maybe,

153
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:46,172
in a penthouse,
with a view of the Statue of Liberty.

154
00:13:48,468 --> 00:13:51,100
You'll have a lovely life.

155
00:13:51,948 --> 00:13:53,742
You will too.

156
00:13:53,788 --> 00:13:58,413
Yeah, when I get out of prison,
with my fat arse and a heroin habit.

157
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:08,422
I want a penthouse.

158
00:14:09,948 --> 00:14:12,703
Even if it's just for one night.

159
00:14:17,265 --> 00:14:18,741
Drive, then.

160
00:14:58,386 --> 00:15:01,102
Oh, yes. See, that's what I'm talking about.

161
00:15:01,145 --> 00:15:05,691
Who's gonna look for
a couple of skanks like us there ?

162
00:15:26,187 --> 00:15:28,620
Oh, my God !

163
00:15:39,748 --> 00:15:41,732
Shoogs.

164
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,973
Oh, wow.

165
00:16:01,987 --> 00:16:04,131
It's beautiful.

166
00:16:06,388 --> 00:16:09,262
I could look at this forever.

167
00:16:10,987 --> 00:16:12,973
So could I.

168
00:16:23,027 --> 00:16:26,060
Oh, she's got some blinging stuff, ain't she ?

169
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:35,943
- I've never even been in a hotel before.
- Well, this is a good start.

170
00:16:35,986 --> 00:16:38,183
I've never been on holiday before.

171
00:16:38,226 --> 00:16:41,852
Mum says what's the point of going on
holiday when you live in a holiday town?

172
00:16:43,345 --> 00:16:46,460
- It's about getting away.
- Mm.

173
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,973
- Anyway, we've got Stella to thank.
- What ?

174
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:53,331
- It was Stella's credit card.
- Oh, yeah !

175
00:16:53,386 --> 00:16:55,901
- To Stella.
- To Stella's credit card.

176
00:16:57,425 --> 00:16:59,893
I bet you've had some proper, nice holidays.

177
00:16:59,948 --> 00:17:04,460
Nathan and Stella love France.
We go there, they get pissed on red wine

178
00:17:04,506 --> 00:17:07,702
and then leave me and Matt to it, as usual.

179
00:17:07,748 --> 00:17:10,380
- That's why you're so good at French.
- Mm.

180
00:17:12,387 --> 00:17:17,660
Ugh ! Are you sure this is
proper champagne ? Cos it is dry as fuck.

181
00:17:17,707 --> 00:17:20,422
It's supposed to be.
It's prized for its dryness.

182
00:17:20,477 --> 00:17:23,932
- It's an acquired taste.
- Nip out and get us some sugar.

183
00:17:23,988 --> 00:17:26,050
You can't put sugar in champagne.

184
00:17:26,107 --> 00:17:31,052
Excuse me ! You can put
a little sugar in anything.

185
00:17:34,707 --> 00:17:36,532
- Don't.
- What ?

186
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:39,570
Don't you wanna acquire a taste ?

187
00:17:39,628 --> 00:17:42,823
- Hm ?
- Don't... do that.

188
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:45,620
Unless you mean it.

189
00:17:47,506 --> 00:17:50,783
Ooh! Miss Tough Tits tonight, ain't ya ?

190
00:17:51,745 --> 00:17:54,213
Huh ? Proper !

191
00:17:54,266 --> 00:17:56,780
Come on, Tough Tits !

192
00:17:56,828 --> 00:17:58,893
You cow !

193
00:17:58,948 --> 00:18:00,981
Oh, you... !

194
00:18:11,786 --> 00:18:14,692
Do you wish you were here with that girl,
then ?

195
00:18:15,426 --> 00:18:18,061
- What girl ?
- You know.

196
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:21,783
- Beth ?
- Oh, is that her name, then ?

197
00:18:22,707 --> 00:18:25,092
Why are you interested ?

198
00:18:25,148 --> 00:18:27,742
I'm not... interested.

199
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:29,931
I thought you were.

200
00:18:29,988 --> 00:18:32,890
So, have you shagged her yet ?

201
00:18:32,947 --> 00:18:35,981
- No.
- Bet you've snogged her, though.

202
00:18:36,026 --> 00:18:37,542
Maybe.

203
00:18:37,588 --> 00:18:40,381
Oooh ! Kimmy.

204
00:18:43,468 --> 00:18:48,490
So why don't you wish you were here with
her ? You could be having a right roll around.

205
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,850
Cos I'm with you.

206
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:54,782
So who's a better kisser, me or her?

207
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:59,702
Huh ? Oh, come on.
Who do you prefer, me or her ?

208
00:19:00,946 --> 00:19:02,661
Beth's great.

209
00:19:03,828 --> 00:19:06,343
She's... really cool.

210
00:19:14,545 --> 00:19:17,662
- So who would you really want here, then ?
- Huh ?

211
00:19:17,706 --> 00:19:20,980
Come on. If you could choose
anyone in the world.

212
00:19:23,188 --> 00:19:24,462
Brad Pitt.

213
00:19:28,828 --> 00:19:30,940
But you'll do.

214
00:19:32,545 --> 00:19:34,612
- Why ?
- Why what ?

215
00:19:35,946 --> 00:19:37,301
Why me ?

216
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,902
- Just because...
- Why ?

217
00:19:43,588 --> 00:19:46,021
Why did you call me tonight ?

218
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:48,503
Why didn't you just leg it out of town ?

219
00:19:51,985 --> 00:19:54,340
Cos I knew you'd come.

220
00:19:57,386 --> 00:19:59,342
Yeah.

221
00:20:00,505 --> 00:20:01,902
That makes sense.

222
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:08,462
It's always gonna be like this, isn't it ?

223
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:11,410
You call, I come running.

224
00:20:11,468 --> 00:20:13,743
You say jump, I say how high ?

225
00:20:15,945 --> 00:20:21,023
Translating for French guys,
buying stuff with my mum's credit card,

226
00:20:21,065 --> 00:20:23,700
snogging you so you can pull someone else.

227
00:20:24,907 --> 00:20:26,782
Name one thing you've done for me.

228
00:20:28,507 --> 00:20:30,622
One thing.

229
00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:34,330
One sodding thing.

230
00:21:03,146 --> 00:21:05,210
I'm sorry.

231
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:14,973
Don't.

232
00:21:26,947 --> 00:21:29,091
Don't worry, Kim.

233
00:21:33,587 --> 00:21:35,973
I mean it this time.

234
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:27,571
<i>Don't you just love
happy Hollywood endings ?</i>

235
