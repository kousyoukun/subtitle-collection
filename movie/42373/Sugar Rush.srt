00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:06,030
Sugar Rush

2
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:18,180
I get a high whenever you're around

3
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:21,020
Sweeping from my head to my toes

4
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:27,650
I gotta get my feet back on the ground

5
00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:31,400
Cuz you make me go out of my way

6
00:00:31,409 --> 00:00:33,790
crossing the line

7
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:40,120
making me say what I have in mind

8
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:42,480
You make me so excited

9
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:44,850
And I don't wanna fight it

10
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:46,960
I start to blush

11
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:49,680
You are my Sugar Rush

12
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:52,090
Ain't nothing better baby

13
00:00:52,099 --> 00:00:54,480
Is it for real or maybe

14
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:56,580
I start to blush

15
00:00:56,589 --> 00:01:01,370
You are my Sugar Rush

16
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:08,390
I got a sweet tooth and I taste for you

17
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:11,400
It might me too obvious but

18
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:17,900
I can't help myself from what I do

19
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,770
Cuz you make me go out of my way

I get weak and talk too much

32
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:59,560
You're the sweetest thing I ever tasted

33
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:02,010
Baby you're my Sugar Rush

34
