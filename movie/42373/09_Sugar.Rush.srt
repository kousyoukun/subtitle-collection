                will understand.

456
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:10,575
Hey, everyone!

457
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,677
Who wants
some more Avaloran chocolate?

458
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:13,878
Yes, please!

459
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,349
[normal voice] Ohh!

460
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,651
I don't understand
   why I was rushing around.

461
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,386
I do.

462
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,922
Joaquín,
  I have a confession to make.

463
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:27,458
The reason you were
     in such a hurry was...

464
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:33,164
my magic got into
   the chocolate I gave you.

465
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,000
A little while back,

466
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:38,336
I fell into a well
      of magical crystals,

467
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:41,405
and it gave me,
      uh, unusual powers.

468
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,440
[chuckles]

469
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,742
What kind of powers?

470
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:48,846
Well, whenever I feel
   really strong emotions,
   something magical happens.

471
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,849
And-and-and I never know
    what it's going to be.

472
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,517
I'm trying to get
       a handle on it,

473
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,386
but I'm not quite there yet.

474
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:56,487
I'm sorry.

475
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,192
There's no need
      to apologize, Elena.

476
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:04,262
In fact, I have
    a confession of my own.

477
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:05,696
Really?

478
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:07,898
I don't know the first thing
  about gondolas.

479
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,601
Caterina is the expert,

480
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,237
but I felt
   like I needed to be, too,

481
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:14,772
because I'm king.

482
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,307
The truth is,

483
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:18,542
I don't know anything
    about weighing counters.

484
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:19,810
-Counterweights.
        -Counterweights.

485
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,045
-Right!
            -Right!

486
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:23,481
So perhaps
    we should delegate this

487
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:27,218
to our Official Gondola
    Project Supervisors?

488
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,220
-Supervisors?
         -Us?

489
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:31,622
I can't think of anyone
    more qualified.

490
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,658
Besides, that'll
      free up my schedule

491
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,328
for a very important
   appointment I can't miss.

492
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,399
Take that,<i> mijita.</i>

493
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,902
Hmm.

494
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:47,571
The Hydro-Gondola
     turned out great, Isa.

495
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:51,642
Thanks, but it's supposed
       to go 17.5% faster.

496
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,277
What's the rush?

497
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,013
This way, everyone can enjoy
  the beautiful view.

498
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,248
And the company.

499
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,749
And the winning.

500
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:10,761
