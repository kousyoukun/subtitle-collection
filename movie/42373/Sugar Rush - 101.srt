{I'll see who's around}

15
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,700
<i>OK, so it's the 21st century.</i>

16
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,700
<i>A 15-year-old using a toothbrush
to masturbate about her best friend</i>

17
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,700
<i>really shouldn't be that big a deal.</i>

18
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:51,700
You'll go blind.

19
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,700
<i>Afterall this is... Brighton.</i>

20
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:03,700
<i>Sin City. The capital of sleaze.</i>

21

<i>We moved here last week so we could escape
the filth and excesses of London...</i>

That's it!

24
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,700
- For fuck's sake, Nathan!
- Pillock!

25
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,700
Bitch!

26
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,700
<i>It was a fucked-up idea from the beginning.</i>

27

<i>This is my dad, Nathan.
Half man, half pinny.</i>

A professional. David?

35
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,700
- Dave.
- David.

36
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,700
- Oh.
- Our handyman Dale is a darling.

37
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,700
A real gem. Done all our friends.

38
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,700
Mm.

39
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,700
<i>And me?</i>

40
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:11,700
<i>I haven't been the same since I met Sugar.</i>

Kiss ass.

44
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,700
<i>The girl I'm sexually obsessed with.</i>

45
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,700
<i>She'll do anything, say anything,
have anything.</i>

46
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,700
<i>Well, anything with a dick,
that's the problem.</i>

47
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,700
<i>She's not gay. And I don't want to be.</i>

48
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,700
<i>It was a twisted relationship
from the moment we met.</i>

49
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,700
Shit!

50
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,700
Hey!

51
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,700
Hold these, will ya?

52
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,700
Fuck! Go on, chase me, you fat git!

53
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,700
I don't think you've paid for those.

54
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,700
<i>I had to put an end to this.</i>

55
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:06,700
<i>Let me stop staring at her tits.</i>

56
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,700
You know, if we're gonna hang out,

57
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,700
you could at least try
and make it less obvious.

58
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:23,700
You're such a fucking virgin.

59
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,700
<i>Sugar was right. I was a virgin.</i>

60
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,700
<i>How did I know I was gay
if I hadn't had sex?</i>

61
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,700
<i>If I slept with a boy, I might Iike it.</i>

62
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,700
<i>You've gotta lose it to prove it.</i>

63
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,700
Hi.

64
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,700
- Nice tits.
- Die.

65
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,700
Dyke!

66
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:57,700
Oh, fuck off! l'm changing.

67
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,700
I want to have sex.

68
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,700
- With a man.
- Well, yeah.

69
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:20,700
Here, hold this.

70
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,700
It's good, innit? Jesus swiped it for me.

71
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,700
From Topshop. Little prick.

72
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,700
- Jesus?
- Yeah, Jesus. My brother, Jesus.

73
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,700
My mum's a Catholic.

74
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,700
Got a problem?

75
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,700
So...who's the lucky guy then?

76
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,700
<i>The lucky guy?</i>

77
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,700
<i>Deciding to sleep with a man's one thing,</i>

78
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,700
<i>but finding one who doesn't
make you feel sick...</i>

79
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,700
<i>The problem with men...</i>

80
00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:07,700
<i>is that the reality
never lives up to the promise.</i>

81
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,700
Hi.

82
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,700
Hi.

83
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,700
Kim, this is Dale,
the handyman Dave recommended.

84
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:26,700
Excuse me.

85
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:32,700
Right. Um...

86
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,700
Better...go. OK.

87
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,700
Told you he was good.

88
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,700
- Trained as an actor.
- Mm.

89
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,700
Fancy all that talent going to waste.

90
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,700
<i>Having explained to Sugar about...</i>

91
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,700
Dale, oh, delicious Dale!

92
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,700
Fill me with your divine...

93
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:04,700
<i>..she'd invited me round to her place
to give me tips on pulling men.</i>

94
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,700
<i>Sugar's room was paradise.</i>

95
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,700
Go on, then. Strip.

96
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,700
- What?
- You won't pull him looking like that.

97
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:17,700
Not unless he's the schoolgirl type,
in which case, stay well clear.

98
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:23,700
Come on. Bra and everything.

99
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,700
Or should l say...corset?

100
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,700
Do you know what you need?

101
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:44,700
- Surgery?
- To get pissed.

102
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,700
Come on!

103
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,700
Down it!

104
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,700
- Again!
- I can't, I'm wasted!

105
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,700
Like this!

106
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:15,700
Roll...your...hips.

107
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,700
Let me see you move, baby.

108
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,700
- Oy!
- Oh, you...

109
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,700
- Pull me.
- What?

110
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,700
Go on. Pull me. Pretend l'm him.
Pretend I'm Duane.

111
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,700
- Dale.
- Dale with the delicious...

112
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,700
Stop it!

113
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,700
I'd better go.

114
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,700
<i>It's amazing how what can seem
like a good idea one minute...</i>

115
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:22,700
<i>...is a crap one the next.</i>

116
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:28,700
Roll...your...hips.

117
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,700
<i>By the time I got back...</i>

118
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:38,700
<i>pulling Dale was the last thing
I had on my mind.</i>

119
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:51,700
Oh! Oh!

120
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,700
Oh, Kim!

121
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,700
Oh!

122
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,700
<i>And anyway, it was Stella
who'd got the decorator in.</i>

123
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,700
Kim!

124
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,700
Kim!

125
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,700
Kim, wait, please!

126
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,700
How could you?

127
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:40,700
Nobody's perfect.

128
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,700
Well...I hate to say it...

129
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,700
..but he's done a good job.

130
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,700
Yeah, nice and straight.

131
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,700
Well hung.

132
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,700
He's gone into all the nooks and crannies.

133
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,700
When he's finished in here,
he can start on the lounge.

134
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,700
Right. Toad-in-the-hole.

135
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,700
- I'm gonna be sick.
- Kim?

136
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,700
- Leave her.
- Your dinner.

137
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,700
- Nathan, it's called growing up.
- She didn't have any breakfast.

138
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,700
Bowl!

139
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,700
<i>Which is worse,</i>

140
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,700
<i>knowing your mum's screwing around
or being too chicken to tell your dad?</i>

141
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,700
<i>There was only one person
I wanted to see right now.</i>

142
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,700
<i>- Hi.
- Unfortunately, it was Tom.</i>

143
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,700
<i>The son of our gay neighbours,
Dave and David.</i>

144
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,700
<i>And my brand-new stalker.</i>

145
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:56,700
Is this a bad time?

146
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,700
Cool. Cool poster.

147
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,700
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

148
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,700
Che!

149
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,700
I mean, cool.

150
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,700
Cool. Revolutionary.

151
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,700
What a man.

152
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,700
And not... No, no... I don't mean I...

153
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,700
I mean, he's not...

154
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,700
Not that I am...

155
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,700
Sometimes with my dad...

156
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:40,700
and my...dad...

157
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,700
I'm not queer.

158
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,700
Would you excuse me for a minute?

159
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:02,700
Erm... Sorry.

160
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:11,700
God help me.

161
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,700
Shit.

162
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,700
Oh, shit.

163
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:22,700
<i>Sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind.</i>

164
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:42,700
Oh!

165
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:51,700
Oh, shit!

166
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,700
<i>I desperately needed a Sugar fix.</i>

167
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,700
<i>Not like she was a great shoulder to cry on.</i>

168
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:10,700
Look on the bright side. At least your mum's
got good taste - you said he was fit.

169
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,700
<i>But the breasts offered some comfort.</i>

170
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,700
I know what'll cheer you up.

171
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:24,700
Donkey-riding.

172
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,700
You know Daz.

173
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,700
<i>Sugar's boyfriend.</i>

174
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,700
<i>The worst DJ in Brighton, which considering
how many there are here,</i>

175
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,700
<i>is something of an achievement.</i>

176
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,700
And this...

177
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,700
This is the Donkey.

178
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,700
<i>- The Donkey?
- All right?</i>

179
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:48,700
<i>OK, so he could have had a funny laugh.</i>

180
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:57,700
- May I?
- Yeah.

181
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,700
<i>Then again...</i>

182
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,700
Mm...

183
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,700
Mmm.

184
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,700
It's not like her. It's strange.

185
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,700
Don't you think it's strange?

186
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,700
She's definitely been acting strangely lately.

187
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:21,700
I know it's an upheaval, changing schools,
settling in, making new friends...

188
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:29,700
But Matt seems to be managing.

189
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,700
She's always loved...

190
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,700
...toad-in-the-hole.

191
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,700
She's stopped calling me Dad.

192
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,700
She never did. It's Stella and Nathan,
always has been.

193
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,700
Maybe that's wrong. Maybe it's time
we started acting like a family.

194
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,700
When was the last time
we all went for a walk?

195
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,700
- Nathan...
- Or went to the cinema or watched TV?

196
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,700
She's 15. You're meant to hate your parents
when you're 15.

197
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:07,700
You think she hates us?

198
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,700
<i>So this was meant to
take my mind off things.</i>

199
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,700
<i>Watching the girl of my dreams
with a man</i>

200
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,700
<i>who spends weekends spinning
Justin Timberlake for the Ladies Rotary.</i>

201
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,700
<i>I had nothing else to distract me.</i>

202
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,700
<i>The Donkey was hardly
a great conversationalist.</i>

203
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,700
Drink?

204
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:34,700
<i>Evidently the blood destined for his brain
had been diverted to greedier organs.</i>

205
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:17,700
Kim? Kiz!

206
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:22,700
Kim? Are you in here?

207
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:28,700
Kiz?

208
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,700
What's wrong?

209
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,700
Nothing.

210
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,700
Well, either you're having a crap
or you're throwing a strop.

211
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:49,700
Either way, something ain't right
cos you've been in there for half an hour.

212
00:17:49,700 --> 00:18:18,700
- What are you doing?
- Coming over.

213
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,700
ls it your mum?

214
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,700
Shouldn't you be with Darren?

215
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:34,700
No, he talks too much.

216
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,700
My dad used to shag around.

217
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:46,700
His wife lived in Hove.

218
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,700
You're better off just...

219
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:42,700
having a laugh, getting pissed,
and forgetting all about it.

220
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,700
Poor sweet Kiz.

221
00:19:52,700 --> 00:20:00,700
You're all fucked up.

222
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,700
If it's any consolation,

223
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,700
all the stuff l said before about losing it...

224
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,700
What?

225
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:26,700
I've always been too pissed to remember.

226
00:20:26,700 --> 00:21:14,700
<i>Why is everyone so fucked up about sex?</i>

227
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:41,700
Kim?

228
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:30,700
Kim, I brought you some dinner.

229
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,700
I, erm...

230
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:46,700
Dad?

231
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,700
It's... There's no toad, it's just, er...hole.

232
00:22:51,700 --> 00:23:16,700
Er, I thought you might be
off the meat again, so...

233
