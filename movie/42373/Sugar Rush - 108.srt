1
00:00:03,551 --> 00:00:10,343
<i>All right, so I'm a 15-year-old queer
virgin and Sugar's a selfish, using bitch.</i>

2
00:00:11,391 --> 00:00:15,509
<i>But there's nothing like a good girlie chat
with your mum to solve an emotional crisis.</i>

3
00:00:15,551 --> 00:00:21,660
He was only good for fucking.
Yeah, I got bored. I actually got bored.

4
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:23,542
Not to mention sore.

5
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:26,663
<i>And as Stella fell back into the loving arms
of her husband,</i>

6
00:00:28,391 --> 00:00:32,179
<i>I tried to nurse my broken heart.</i>

7
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:24,664
<i>OK, so the stupid Malory Towers
gay crush thing had to end.</i>

8
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:27,108
<i>Sugar was a bitch.</i>

9
00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:44,551
<i>Although kissing her was...</i>

10
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:52,546
<i>Enough was enough.</i>

11
00:01:55,671 --> 00:01:57,074
Welcome home.

12
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,258
<i>I needed some serious straight-talkers.</i>

13
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:04,624
Welcome home to the heterosexual life
that God intended for you.

14
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,509
Hi. I'm Belinda.

15
00:02:10,551 --> 00:02:14,863
I overcame lesbianism in 1999
and now I date men.

16
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:18,829
Well, one man. Once.

17
00:02:23,111 --> 00:02:25,102
Hi. I'm Gary.

18
00:02:25,151 --> 00:02:28,826
I um... I left homosexuality two years ago

19
00:02:28,871 --> 00:02:34,309
and have been happily married
for six months, to a woman,

20
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:39,305
hoping to begin conjugal relations
any day now.

21
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:47,705
And you too can be like Belinda and Gary,

22
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:51,983
safe at home with God,

23
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:57,788
by following our six simple steps
along the straight path.

24
00:02:57,831 --> 00:03:02,268
Step one: Use a mantra to focus your mind.

25
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:05,462
Something that trips off the tongue.
"Homos go to hell."

26
00:03:05,511 --> 00:03:07,263
"Gay girls burn."

27
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:09,949
Or whatever works for you.

28
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:12,221
<i>OK, it was extreme.</i>

29
00:03:12,271 --> 00:03:14,546
<i>But so was my Sugar addiction.</i>

30
00:03:19,671 --> 00:03:22,231
Sugar is bad for me. 
Sugar is bad for me.

31
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:25,820
<i>You only find out what you're really made of
when put to the test.</i>

32
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:30,065
Hey, Kiz. Come down off that E yet?
Fucking great night.

33
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:32,269
<i>Sugar is bad for me. Sugar is...</i>

34
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:34,700
<i>Oh, God. Crowd out bra.</i>

35
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:35,818
You're not mad at me, are you?

36
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,176
<i>Stop perving.
Stop perving.</i>

37
00:03:38,179 --> 00:03:39,100
What have you taken?

38
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:42,102
<i>Bad for me. Bad for me.
Bad for me.</i>

39
00:03:42,151 --> 00:03:43,135
Give me one.

40
00:03:43,136 --> 00:03:44,136
<i>Sugar is bad for me, Sugar is...</i>

41
00:03:44,511 --> 00:03:48,060
OK, then. See you later.

42
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:49,908
Go and see a doctor.

43
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:57,350
<i>Success! I passed the test.
Beat my demons.</i>

44
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:01,341
<i>If only I hadn't looked back.</i>

45
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:04,940
<i>But what do you expect?
I was from a family of delusional saddos.</i>

46
00:04:06,111 --> 00:04:08,022
This is nice, isn't it?

47
00:04:08,551 --> 00:04:11,463
You know, all of us together, a family again.

48
00:04:17,151 --> 00:04:19,187
How's school, Kim?

49
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:22,504
And Sugar? How's she?

50
00:04:22,551 --> 00:04:26,180
Sugar is bad for me.
Sugar is bad for me. Sugar is bad for me.

51
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:31,624
Crowd out sexual thoughts
with pleasant images of nature.

52
00:05:00,451 --> 00:05:01,299
Step three.

53
00:05:02,391 --> 00:05:05,667
Maintain a chaste lifestyle.

54
00:05:08,551 --> 00:05:09,870
Step four.

55
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:15,349
As homosexuality
is invariably caused by rejection

56
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,507
by a same-sex parent,

57
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:21,385
we have to try and heal rifts.

58
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:24,901
<i>I might have known the prodigal
mother was the root of my evils.</i>

59
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:27,101
<i>Still, steps were steps.</i>

60
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:29,381
Here. Let me.

61
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:32,343
Oh, Kim, you darling.

62
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:36,066
Step five: Hang out with like-minded people.

63
00:05:36,111 --> 00:05:37,100
Yeah?

64
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:47,230
- I go to the cinema a lot.
- Yeah?

65
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:50,542
What kind of stuff do you like?

66
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:54,663
Dunno... um...

67
00:05:54,711 --> 00:05:58,260
Comedies. Or anything with Jodie Foster in.

68
00:05:58,311 --> 00:06:01,064
Me too. I love her.

69
00:06:05,191 --> 00:06:08,342
And step six: Read the Bible.

70
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:10,382
And be sure to pray.

71
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,901
Dear God,
please stop me perving over Sugar

72
00:06:13,951 --> 00:06:16,670
and help me find a fit guy
to perv over instead.

73
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:19,908
Or if it turns out you're OK
with the whole same-sex thing,

74
00:06:19,951 --> 00:06:23,705
then stop Sugar messing me about
and help her find her way into my bed.

75
00:06:27,911 --> 00:06:31,062
<i>That was the thing with God.
Who really knew?</i>

76
00:06:31,111 --> 00:06:33,784
<i>Best to keep all bases covered.</i>

77
00:06:34,271 --> 00:06:37,104
Why did you come back?

78
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,622
Why?

79
00:06:42,671 --> 00:06:45,139
For me?

80
00:06:45,191 --> 00:06:47,500
For the kids?

81
00:06:51,431 --> 00:06:53,661
Stella?

82
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:14,581
The wrath of God is revealed from heaven

83
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:19,466
against all ungodliness
and unrighteousness.

84
00:07:19,511 --> 00:07:22,389
<i>It said a lot about my family life
that I preferred this.</i>

85
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:24,422
So there it is, guys.

86
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:27,508
If you give in to vile affections,

87
00:07:27,551 --> 00:07:32,784
if, women, you change the natural use
into that which is against nature,

88
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:39,100
and, men, leave the natural use of women
to burn in lust for one another...

89
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:42,390
well, then.

90
00:07:46,831 --> 00:07:50,141
<i>Whoa. I had a Sugar thing, not a girl thing.</i>

91
00:07:50,191 --> 00:07:53,866
<i>Time to resort to a few steps of my own.</i>

92
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:59,269
<i>Like drown suspicions of gaydom
in vat of alcohol.</i>

93
00:08:01,151 --> 00:08:03,824
<i>Or hang out with a bunch of Neanderthals.</i>

94
00:08:04,991 --> 00:08:06,902
- Can I have a vodka?
- No, sorry.

95
00:08:08,351 --> 00:08:10,660
- Just give me a drink.
- You're underage.

96
00:08:10,711 --> 00:08:13,145
I'll get it. She's with me.

97
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:15,500
Here you are. Whatever she wants.

98
00:08:15,551 --> 00:08:17,382
- Thanks.
- That's all right.

99
00:08:52,751 --> 00:08:55,026
I forgive you.

100
00:08:57,351 --> 00:08:59,911
- I said...
- I heard.

101
00:08:59,951 --> 00:09:03,068
Please stop being so nice to me.

102
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:17,065
Come on. Oh, come on.

103
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,030
- Fuck!
- I'm trying.

104
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:26,143
Hang on. Hang on.

105
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,705
I'm getting there.

106
00:09:31,311 --> 00:09:33,302
Sorry about this.

107
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:04,310
Hey. What's wrong?

108
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:07,381
It's not your fault.

109
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:11,062
Are you a virgin?

110
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,260
For fuck's sake.

111
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,825
Look, I didn't do anything, all right?

112
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:16,987
I didn't do anything.

113
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,702
<i>Was God having a laugh or what?</i>

114
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:32,946
<i>I was a hermetically sealed medical freak,</i>

115
00:10:32,991 --> 00:10:35,061
<i>undoubted lesbian, proficient at pool,</i>

116
00:10:35,111 --> 00:10:37,545
<i>but worse, much worse,</i>

117
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:42,426
<i>completely unable
to stop thinking about Sugar.</i>

118
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:53,503
Let's face it, Nathan,
it is partly your fault I had an affair.

119
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:55,030
Look at me.

120
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,346
I'm a red-blooded woman in her prime

121
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:01,384
and you've turned into
some uptight pinny-wearing house husband.

122
00:11:01,431 --> 00:11:03,308
Yeah, you're right. I'll change.

123
00:11:03,351 --> 00:11:08,106
No, don't change, just chill out.

124
00:11:09,311 --> 00:11:10,869
Look.

125
00:11:13,511 --> 00:11:15,900
Unpacking done.

126
00:11:17,031 --> 00:11:19,829
Just try and relax a bit.
Be a bit more spontaneous.

127
00:11:19,871 --> 00:11:23,705
- Spontaneous?
- Yeah. Spontaneous.

128
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:27,543
Or you'll tidy yourself out of a marriage.

129
00:11:34,951 --> 00:11:36,350
- Hey.
- Hiya.

130
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:41,227
<i>OK, so sometimes
when you're a tortured misfit freak,</i>

131
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:43,705
<i>a stalker can be quite good company.</i>

132
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:49,190
Sometimes I wanna just leave
and never go back.

133
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:54,510
Nathan's gone into happy-family overdrive,
acting like nothing's ever happened,

134
00:11:54,551 --> 00:12:00,183
and Stella, she's being quiet and nice,

135
00:12:00,231 --> 00:12:05,863
like asking me how school is
and stuff like that.

136
00:12:05,911 --> 00:12:08,141
Isn't that what mums are supposed to do?

137
00:12:08,191 --> 00:12:10,625
No. I just wish she'd lay off.

138
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:13,789
Oh.

139
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:15,867
I'll see you, then.

140
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:23,302
Unless...

141
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:43,862
Hey.

142
00:12:43,911 --> 00:12:45,981
Right, here we are.

143
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,589
OK.

144
00:12:51,431 --> 00:12:57,700
So we've got a Cosmopolitan
or a Martini or a Filthy Queer.

145
00:12:58,151 --> 00:13:00,107
It's just one of my own inventions.

146
00:13:00,151 --> 00:13:05,384
It's basically all the spirits we can find
with a little bit of Coke

147
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:07,228
to mess it up a little bit.

148
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,822
Oh. Ooh.

149
00:13:16,231 --> 00:13:18,347
Spontaneous.

150
00:13:19,191 --> 00:13:20,783
Spontaneous?

151
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:27,143
Yeah. Spontaneous.

152
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,666
Yeah. Spontaneous.

153
00:13:34,031 --> 00:13:39,947
Spon-tan-e-ou-ou-ous

154
00:13:45,631 --> 00:13:48,623
<i>You know, as the saying goes,
it's good to talk,</i>

155
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,060
<i>however economical you are with the truth.</i>

156
00:13:51,111 --> 00:13:55,343
He couldn't get it up.
He got me there under false pretences.

157
00:13:55,391 --> 00:13:59,782
He was...
What's the male version of a prick tease?

158
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:02,504
A twat tease.

159
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,621
Yeah, he was that.

160
00:14:04,671 --> 00:14:07,743
- I didn't even fancy him.
- Well, you wouldn't, would you?

161
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,584
For fuck's sake, how many times 
do I have to tell you?

162
00:14:10,591 --> 00:14:13,427
- Sorry.
- Anyway, it was just a Sugar thing.

163
00:14:13,471 --> 00:14:16,747
I told you I loved her as a joke.
It was a wind-up.

164
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,782
- Mm.
- Mm.

165
00:14:18,831 --> 00:14:22,540
Anyway, you love Sugar more than me.

166
00:14:22,591 --> 00:14:28,348
Well... Well, as we're talking
sexual disasters.

167
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,268
She did tell me.

168
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:36,186
Yeah.

169
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:44,742
I'm gonna be a virgin for ever.

170
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:10,744
- Steady. Steady.
- Nathan.

171
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:14,147
All right, just sit in the chair.
No, keep going forwards.

172
00:15:14,191 --> 00:15:16,944
Keep going. Whoa.

173
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,745
- Please, I...
- Sit down now.

174
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,430
- Are you ready?
- Mm-hm.

175
00:15:23,471 --> 00:15:25,826
And... da-da!

176
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:27,980
Oh.

177
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:31,579
Nathan, I really appreciate all your efforts...

178
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:36,022
No, I thought we'd skip dinner
and just go straight for the fun part.

179
00:15:37,951 --> 00:15:39,589
When do I ever eat puddings?

180
00:15:39,631 --> 00:15:43,419
You always used to. It used to be
your favourite part of the meal.

181
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:47,900
Mm.

182
00:15:50,191 --> 00:15:52,102
Uh- uh.

183
00:15:54,271 --> 00:15:56,387
Mm. Mm.

184
00:15:56,431 --> 00:16:00,060
- Mm. What?
- Nothing.

185
00:16:00,111 --> 00:16:03,945
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you didn't want any.

186
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,429
Here.

187
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:12,990
Here.

188
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:19,861
Mmm!

189
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:22,709
- Mmm! Mmm!
- Good.

190
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:40,386
- Are you sure?
- Tom, I wanna have sex. We're good to go.

191
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:44,310
<i>It's got to be better to lose your virginity
to the boy next door in a bedroom</i>

192
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:46,706
<i>than to an ape in a pool hall toilet.</i>

193
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:53,579
<i>It was nice. Tom was nice.</i>

194
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:55,826
<i>Of course, it was a whole lot nicer when I...</i>

195
00:17:13,671 --> 00:17:16,583
<i>Although fantasising during my first time...</i>

196
00:17:16,631 --> 00:17:19,862
<i>I'm sure they don't tell you to do that
in Cosmo Girl.</i>

197
00:17:23,671 --> 00:17:26,390
Come on. Whoa!

198
00:17:32,191 --> 00:17:34,546
Whoa! Come on!

199
00:17:42,151 --> 00:17:44,904
What... You're choking.

200
00:17:44,951 --> 00:17:48,466
All right. Hang on. Come on. Turn round.

201
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,544
Has it gone? Oh, my God.

202
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:55,628
- Agh!
- Oh, my God. Something cracked.

203
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:58,390
Oh, my God. Don't die.

204
00:17:58,431 --> 00:18:01,343
Please don't die on me, Stella. I love you.

205
00:18:01,391 --> 00:18:03,985
I love you so much. Don't die.

206
00:18:04,031 --> 00:18:07,819
What do you... A drink?

207
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:10,180
The phone. The phone. Oh, my God.

208
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,503
<i>So, that was sex.</i>

209
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:18,348
Ambulance, please.

210
00:18:19,751 --> 00:18:22,390
<i>There were lots of positives.
I wasn't a virgin anymore.</i>

211
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:24,820
<i>I wasn't a sealed-up medical freak.</i>

212
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:26,350
I guess you're not gay afterall.

213
00:18:27,431 --> 00:18:30,229
<i>Shame he had to ruin the moment.</i>

214
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,785
Tom, I've gotta go.

215
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,822
Go? Now?

216
00:18:34,871 --> 00:18:37,590
Homework.

217
00:18:37,631 --> 00:18:39,622
Oh.

218
00:18:54,071 --> 00:18:56,062
Hey.

219
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,782
Thank you.

220
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:12,142
Bye.

221
00:19:18,071 --> 00:19:20,301
<i>No shooting stars, no comets,</i>

222
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:23,980
<i>no veil falling to reveal
all the secrets of the adult world.</i>

223
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,022
<i>No different.</i>

224
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:28,869
<i>Just the flashing lights, though.</i>

225
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,665
- What the hell happened?
- I took her breath away.

226
00:19:35,711 --> 00:19:39,306
- Literally... Just literally.
- What?

227
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:43,185
She's all right, Kim.
It's just a little food mishap.

228
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:47,304
- Are you all right with Matt?
- Yeah. Sure.

229
00:19:49,191 --> 00:19:51,864
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No, thanks. I'm OK.

230
00:20:28,471 --> 00:20:30,063
Oh, Jesus, Kiz.

231
00:20:32,471 --> 00:20:35,508
- What are you doing here?
- Matt let me in.

232
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:38,384
And why are you here?

233
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:44,781
I nicked a bottle of whisky from Mum's
secret stash. Thought I'd cheer you up.

234
00:20:44,831 --> 00:20:46,947
Moody cow.

235
00:20:46,991 --> 00:20:52,224
Only... you weren't here when I got here,
and so...

236
00:20:53,111 --> 00:20:55,466
Right, so you can go, then.

237
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:57,706
Why are you acting so weird?

238
00:20:59,111 --> 00:21:01,420
Not cos of that snog, is it?

239
00:21:01,471 --> 00:21:03,701
We were on E. It's no big deal.

240
00:21:06,871 --> 00:21:08,589
Come on, Kiz.

241
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:11,991
- Oh, Kizzy.
- It was a big deal to me.

242
00:21:14,831 --> 00:21:20,144
You know how I feel about you.
And all you do is fuck me around.

243
00:21:22,711 --> 00:21:25,384
What do you want me to do?
Ask you out?

244
00:21:25,431 --> 00:21:27,661
Hold your hand in the playground?

245
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:34,063
- Just go.
- Why?

246
00:21:34,111 --> 00:21:36,500
Isn't this where you want me?

247
00:21:36,551 --> 00:21:39,588
Do you get sadistic pleasure
out of taunting me?

248
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,748
Or are you just too thick
to realise you're doing it?

249
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,182
Bye, then.

250
00:22:01,471 --> 00:22:05,430
<i>Bitch. Always had to have the last word.</i>

251
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:07,666
Stand and hold hands for the Lord's Prayer.

252
00:22:13,991 --> 00:22:16,061
<i>Powerful thing, self- belief.</i>

<i>A sudden surge is transforming.</i>

254

<i>The possession of it,
or impression of it,</i>

255
00:22:26,351 --> 00:22:28,148
<i>has a hold over others.</i>

256
00:22:28,191 --> 00:22:31,581
<i>But when it goes, what's left?</i>

257
00:22:31,631 --> 00:22:34,543
Our Father, who art in heaven...

258
00:22:34,591 --> 00:22:36,900
<i>And just a little
can make you take a chance.</i>

00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:46,421
Give us this day our daily bread

00:22:46,471 --> 00:22:48,939
and forgive us our trespasses

263
00:22:48,991 --> 00:22:51,630
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

264
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:54,549
And lead us not into temptation

265
00:22:54,591 --> 00:22:57,185
but deliver us from evil.
