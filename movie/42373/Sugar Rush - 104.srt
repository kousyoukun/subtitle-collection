1
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:05,424
<i>OK. So I'm Kim, </i>

2
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:09,073
<i>a 15-year-old gay virgin
obsessed with my best friend Sugar,</i>

3
00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:10,451
<i>the bling bike of Brighton.</i>

4
00:00:10,753 --> 00:00:14,269
<i>It isn't easy watching the girl you're in love with
throw herself on anything with a dick.</i>

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,529
<i>It makes you consider stuff that you
wouldn't normally, like date rape and things.</i>

6
00:00:18,861 --> 00:00:20,624
<i>Of course I didn't go actually through with it.</i>

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,517
<i>I accidentally almost killed my brother, which
wasn't so bad.</i>

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,462
<i>which at least got my fucked-up parents talking.</i>

9
00:00:26,877 --> 00:00:27,994
<i>And it got me a whole night,</i>

10
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:30,057
<i>albeit a frustratingly platonic one,</i>

11
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:32,797
<i>in the same bed as the woman of my dreams.</i>

12
00:01:42,566 --> 00:01:44,451
Aren't you coming in ?
It's lovely.

13
00:01:50,707 --> 00:01:51,495
Stella ?

14
00:02:02,636 --> 00:02:07,109
- Maybe we could go to the cinema later ?
- Mmm... Busy.

15
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,589
<i>There comes a point in life
when you have to stop deluding yourself.</i>

16
00:02:18,484 --> 00:02:21,617
<i>When you realise that the lies
are getting you nowhere,</i>

17
00:02:22,391 --> 00:02:27,245
<i>tangling you further in your fucked-up
knotted web of deceit.</i>

18
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,838
<i>It was time to make a break.</i>

19
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:32,664
<i>It was time to come clean.</i>

20
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:42,337
<i>The way I saw it, I had a simple choice.</i>

21
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,341
<i>I could tell her...</i>

22
00:02:49,193 --> 00:02:50,255
I love you.

23
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:53,135
<i>Or I could tell her that...</i>

24
00:02:56,817 --> 00:02:58,352
It's over between us.

25
00:02:59,522 --> 00:03:01,398
We can no longer be friends.

26
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,129
<i>One way or another,
I'd move things on between us.</i>

27
00:03:06,605 --> 00:03:07,912
<i>It coudn't go on like this.</i>

28
00:03:08,473 --> 00:03:10,318
<i>It was unhealthy, dangerous.</i>

29
00:03:12,771 --> 00:03:15,205
<i>I was becoming sexually obsessed.</i>

30
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:22,734
Well ?

31
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:25,970
Are you gonna stand there gawping
or you are you coming in ?

32
00:03:29,821 --> 00:03:30,653
Crabs.

33
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:32,637
Vicious little shits.

34
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,964
They're itching enough to drive me mental.

35
00:03:36,403 --> 00:03:37,743
Have I missed a bit on my back ?

36
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:43,740
- Sod Darren.
- You got them off Darren ?

37
00:03:43,908 --> 00:03:45,406
I don't know, do I ?

38
00:03:45,707 --> 00:03:47,092
They don't come with name tags.

39
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:50,261
Bet the bastard will chuck us
when he finds out.

40
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:53,133
I think it was the Donkey.

41
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:54,838
Darren's best friend ?

42
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,155
Yeah. Always scratching his bits.

43
00:03:58,023 --> 00:04:01,383
Mind you, Ray isn't exactly an angel,
is he ?

44
00:04:07,137 --> 00:04:08,010
Ray ?

45
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:10,026
Sorry ?

46
00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:13,079
Ray, the doorman. Lost Vegas.

47
00:04:13,657 --> 00:04:16,588
Free entry and half-price drinks, he said.

48
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,039
Didn't mention anything about the plague
of muff nits being thrown into the deal.

49
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:23,817
<i>The situation was hardly romantic.</i>

50
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:24,817
So ?

51
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:27,063
So ?

52
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:28,399
What did you come round for ?

53
00:04:28,507 --> 00:04:31,945
<i>Somehow my declarations of love
weren't forthcoming.</i>

54
00:04:33,836 --> 00:04:34,576
Nothing.

55
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,093
And l was booked for a Brazilian, Saturday.

56
00:04:37,387 --> 00:04:39,299
At least that way they'd have less to hang on to.

57
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:48,100
It's flammable, you tit.

58
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:58,382
<i>There was something about the whole
situation that made me uneasy.</i>

59
00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:03,410
<i>I mean, I'd always known what Sugar was like
with men.</i>

60
00:05:04,086 --> 00:05:05,010
Hi, boys.

61
00:05:05,897 --> 00:05:07,181
<i>And sex.</i>

62
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,885
All that stuff I said before about losing it.

63
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,856
I've always been too pissed to remember.

64
00:05:13,368 --> 00:05:15,397
<i>But crabs ? Bush fleas ? </i>

65
00:05:15,546 --> 00:05:17,762
<i>She didn't even know
who she'd caught them off.</i>

66
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,242
Sod Darren. The Donkey. Ray.

67
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:23,441
<i>Was that the type of person I wanted to be with ?</i>

68
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:29,617
Infestation can be spread by a person
sharing the same bed linen, towels, clothes.

69
00:05:29,906 --> 00:05:33,370
A person sharing the same... bed linen ?

70
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:36,323
Oh, God.

71
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,930
<i>Just when you thought life couldn't get any worse,</i>

72
00:05:42,827 --> 00:05:45,389
<i>you're a virgin with a sexually-transmitted disease.</i>

73
00:05:46,953 --> 00:05:48,638
Thanks a lot, Sugar, you fucking...

74
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,055
Supper's ready.

75
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,664
Seafood paella.

76
00:06:01,088 --> 00:06:02,965
Just leave what you can't eat.

77
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:05,784
Stella ? You'd better eat before you go.

78
00:06:06,194 --> 00:06:08,791
If Elaine's that upset,
I doubt she'll be cooking.

79
00:06:09,164 --> 00:06:09,859
Elaine ?

80
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:11,612
A friend your mum met at the gym.

81
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,409
Her mum's just died.

82
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,733
Stella's helping her sort through her things.

83
00:06:17,438 --> 00:06:20,380
What are you wearing ?
Are those my jeans ?

84
00:06:20,905 --> 00:06:23,502
Er... Thought I'd make an effort.

85
00:06:23,503 --> 00:06:24,426
Cheer her up a bit.

86
00:06:31,694 --> 00:06:33,607
Er... Give my condolences to Emma.

87
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:35,284
Will do.

88
00:06:37,368 --> 00:06:38,676
Sorry. Elaine.

89
00:06:40,378 --> 00:06:41,195
Hello ?

90
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:46,859
<i>Suspicious isn't a term
you could use to describe Nathan.</i>

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,847
<i>But even his curiosity
would have been raised</i>

92
00:06:50,848 --> 00:06:52,727
<i>by the sight of his 15-year-old daughter</i>

93
00:06:52,794 --> 00:06:54,557
<i>voluntarly doing the washing.</i>

94
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,202
Kim ?

95
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:01,771
Er... What are you doing ?

96
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:05,492
I'm boil-washing my belongings

97
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:08,170
to kill the muff nits
contracted from a platonic night

98
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,916
of frustration with a girl of my lesbian dreams.

99
00:07:11,475 --> 00:07:12,285
<i>Right...</i>

100
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,802
Why ?

101
00:07:15,974 --> 00:07:18,114
Er... You're... helping.

102
00:07:22,002 --> 00:07:25,095
Well, yeah. Someone's gotta do it.

103
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:29,861
It's not like Stella ever lifts
a finger around here.

104
00:07:30,954 --> 00:07:32,679
Your mum's out helping a friend.

105
00:07:34,498 --> 00:07:35,496
A friend ?

106
00:07:40,063 --> 00:07:41,365
I've had about enough of this.

107
00:07:42,287 --> 00:07:44,892
I know you two don't see everything eye to
eye at the moment,

108
00:07:44,955 --> 00:07:46,833
but I really think... Kim?

109
00:07:47,658 --> 00:07:48,395
Kim !

110
00:07:56,385 --> 00:07:59,105
You could at least be more supportive of your mother.

111
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:07,201
When she's helping someone.

112
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,743
In their hour of need.

113
00:08:16,637 --> 00:08:17,491
Coming !

114
00:08:24,563 --> 00:08:25,640
They're Kim's.

115
00:08:33,025 --> 00:08:33,909
Stella.

116
00:08:35,303 --> 00:08:36,844
We are not alone.

117
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:40,782
Oh, God... You're crawling.

118
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,661
She...

119
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:57,957
How many other housewives
get your VIP services ?

120
00:08:58,007 --> 00:08:59,422
You're blaming this on me ?

121
00:08:59,983 --> 00:09:00,831
Who else ?

122
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:02,775
Your husband.

123
00:09:03,185 --> 00:09:04,225
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

124
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:10,520
And before you say it, you're the first other
man I have had for quite some time.

125
00:09:14,506 --> 00:09:15,465
God, look at you.

126
00:09:16,447 --> 00:09:17,523
What do you mean, look at me ?

127
00:09:18,161 --> 00:09:18,930
Should have known.

128
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:23,738
All right, fine. Fine.
Show me one.

129
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:25,941
I'm sorry ?

130
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,310
Crab. See any ?

131
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:32,076
So ?

132
00:09:32,254 --> 00:09:33,140
No lice.

133
00:09:33,815 --> 00:09:35,500
Doesn't mean anything.
They're like nits.

134
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:36,918
They like hair that's clean.

135
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:42,446
Ha ! What's that ?

136
00:09:45,558 --> 00:09:46,602
Hang on. Where are you going ?

137
00:09:47,663 --> 00:09:48,773
The chemist.

138
00:09:48,842 --> 00:09:50,223
Who pays for the suite ?

139
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:01,192
Oh, shit.

140
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:27,679
<i>Stella washing her own clothes ?</i>

141
00:10:27,848 --> 00:10:28,972
Are those my jeans ?

142
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:31,298
<i>Oh, my God...</i>

143
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,875
Stella ? Um... What are you doing ?

144
00:10:46,538 --> 00:10:47,856
What does it look like ?

145
00:10:51,948 --> 00:10:52,995
But you never...

146
00:10:55,492 --> 00:10:56,794
Cottons on D.

147
00:10:56,795 --> 00:10:59,063
Yes, I know how it works.
Thank you.

148
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,090
Work, you bloody thing !

149
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,706
How was Elaine ?

150
00:11:20,183 --> 00:11:23,786
<i>This wasn't really the kind of situation
you could prepare yourself for.</i>

151
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:27,784
<i>Giving your mother an STD ?</i>

152
00:12:31,047 --> 00:12:34,342
<i>With 120 million red crabs
migrating overland,</i>

153
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,903
<i>it's hard to avoid them.</i>

154
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:38,475
<i>The island's coastal rainforests</i>

155
00:12:38,476 --> 00:12:40,370
<i>also play host to the crabs.</i>

156
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:43,153
<i>Here, they face fewer dangers.</i>

157
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:50,350
<i>The migration which lasts several days
happens at the same time every year.</i>

158
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:56,599
<i>It hits Christmas Island, so-called because
it was discovered on Christmas Day,</i>

159
00:12:56,767 --> 00:12:59,228
<i>just as the festive season gets underway.</i>

160
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:00,749
Can you smell something ?

161
00:13:01,225 --> 00:13:02,574
Hair remover.

162
00:13:02,575 --> 00:13:07,250
<i>The invasion causes havoc for the human
population of the Australian territory.</i>

163
00:13:07,374 --> 00:13:10,374
<i>Even schools have to get used
to the unwanted visitors.</i>

164
00:13:11,945 --> 00:13:13,450
<i>While it can be a nuisance,</i>

165
00:13:13,516 --> 00:13:16,678
<i>it's also an impressive sight
and considered by many</i>

166
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,945
<i>to be one of the great wonders of nature.</i>

167
00:13:34,818 --> 00:13:36,096
Kim ?

168
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:43,604
Can we talk ?

169
00:13:44,244 --> 00:13:45,290
<i>Oh, God.</i>

170
00:13:55,363 --> 00:13:56,895
I couldn't help noticing.

171
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,916
Downstairs and then the washing.

172
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:01,952
<i>Stay calm, stay calm.</i>

173
00:14:02,313 --> 00:14:04,311
Don't give anything away.

174
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:07,207
Oh, my poor baby.

175
00:14:09,626 --> 00:14:10,826
What have I done ?

176
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:13,074
<i>What have you done ?</i>

177
00:14:14,466 --> 00:14:15,663
Sleazy...

178
00:14:19,394 --> 00:14:22,348
We all do silly things.

179
00:14:22,783 --> 00:14:26,501
And um... these things lead into situations

180
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,220
and these situations have consequences,

181
00:14:29,221 --> 00:14:31,497
consequences we didn't foresee at the time,

182
00:14:31,508 --> 00:14:34,540
and these consequences can affect others

183
00:14:35,014 --> 00:14:37,642
in a way that we had no idea.

184
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:38,994
I mean, I never dreamt...

185
00:14:46,784 --> 00:14:48,745
Kim ? I...

186
00:14:49,797 --> 00:14:53,509
<i>This was turning into a very interesting situation.</i>

187
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,298
Dale...

188
00:15:01,661 --> 00:15:02,387
I wasn't thinking.

189
00:15:02,388 --> 00:15:06,219
I borrowed some of your clothes
and I may have...

190
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:09,144
have given you crabs.

191
00:15:09,145 --> 00:15:11,675
<i>This was too good to be true.</i>

192
00:15:12,107 --> 00:15:13,309
But they're not dangerous.

193
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,820
They're unpleasant but treatable.

194
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,849
- It's very simple.
- I already have.

195
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,333
Right.

196
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,265
Kim, love.

197
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:38,131
You won't tell your dad ?

198
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:46,817
You're to stop borrowing my things.

199
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,683
They look fat on you anyway.

200
00:15:50,731 --> 00:15:52,307
And you're to stop seeing him.

201
00:15:52,557 --> 00:15:53,526
Dale ?

202
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:56,666
It's over. Finished.
Simple as that.

203
00:16:03,655 --> 00:16:04,893
I'd rather not.

204
00:16:06,286 --> 00:16:07,945
Cross infection.

205
00:16:46,668 --> 00:16:48,098
I can't seem to stop itching.

206
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:52,648
<i>That's the thing about infections.</i>

207
00:16:53,127 --> 00:16:57,491
<i>Just when you think you've got them under
controm, they spread like bushfire again.</i>

208
00:17:07,103 --> 00:17:08,005
Dad ?

209
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,536
Night.

210
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,165
Good night.

211
00:17:29,242 --> 00:17:32,136
<i>- You can't deny it.
- What are you on about ?</i>

212
00:17:32,137 --> 00:17:34,822
<i>- Don't sit there like it's nothing.
- It is nothing.</i>

213
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:40,267
<i>You have given me an STD which means
you have slept with someone else.</i>

214
00:17:41,388 --> 00:17:44,570
<i>- Keep your voice down.
- Did you sleep with someone ?</i>

215
00:17:45,084 --> 00:17:46,133
<i>Stella, have you ?</i>

216
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:48,228
<i>- Be rational.
- Rational ?</i>

217
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,942
<i>How rational do you want me to be ?</i>

218
00:17:50,151 --> 00:17:51,277
<i>For Christ's sake !</i>

219
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,335
<i>Tell me how this happened !</i>

220
00:17:53,695 --> 00:17:54,750
<i>You're jumping the gun.</i>

221
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:57,800
<i>The evidence is all over me.</i>

222
00:17:57,801 --> 00:17:59,837
- They're crabs, Stella.
- You don't know that.

223
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,742
Pubic lice, passed on through sexual contact.

224
00:18:02,946 --> 00:18:04,030
Could be scabies.

225
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:05,973
You might have picked it up at the office.

226
00:18:06,191 --> 00:18:07,813
Oh, for fuck's sake !

227
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,029
Keep your voice down.

228
00:18:09,734 --> 00:18:10,629
The kids.

229
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:15,045
Stella, you... you are the only person

230
00:18:15,046 --> 00:18:17,540
hat I have slept with in 18 years.

231
00:18:18,435 --> 00:18:21,462
Now, can you please just tell me
what's going on here ?

232
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:25,463
Nathan, I...

233
00:18:38,353 --> 00:18:39,974
I've been seeing...

234
00:18:40,946 --> 00:18:43,211
sleeping with someone else.

235
00:18:44,754 --> 00:18:45,803
Dale.

236
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:54,830
What ? The de... The decorator ?

237
00:18:58,849 --> 00:18:59,704
Oh, God.

238
00:19:02,657 --> 00:19:03,754
No, please...

239
00:19:06,028 --> 00:19:08,523
Please, no. Not him.

240
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:12,330
Not the decorator. No.

241
00:19:26,264 --> 00:19:28,910
<i>I promised myself I wouldn't see Sugar.</i>

242
00:19:35,138 --> 00:19:36,812
<i>At least not until I'd plucked up the courage</i>

243
00:19:36,813 --> 00:19:38,816
<i>to tell her how I really felt about things.</i>

244
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:47,885
<i>It was just that right now she was the only person
I wanted to see.</i>

245
00:19:48,204 --> 00:19:49,326
Sugar ?

246
00:19:53,117 --> 00:19:55,363
Kim ? Sshh...

247
00:19:56,485 --> 00:19:58,605
It's OK. Sshh...

248
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:04,285
It's OK.

249
00:20:15,365 --> 00:20:18,163
Tango, Pro Plus and vodka.

250
00:20:19,058 --> 00:20:20,449
That'll fix you up a bit.

251
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:26,279
Think she'll leave ?

252
00:20:30,641 --> 00:20:32,259
What is with those flowers ?

253
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,149
Ray. Donkey.

254
00:20:41,427 --> 00:20:44,226
I gave them the fifth degree
and made them feel well guilty.

255
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,665
Passing their filth on to an underage girl.

256
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,748
I mean, I'm vulnerable, aren't I ?

257
00:20:51,026 --> 00:20:52,264
I threatened to tell the police.

258
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,045
Teddy bear's from Daz.

259
00:20:59,901 --> 00:21:01,978
Probably won it on the pier, the cheap git.

260
00:21:02,454 --> 00:21:05,330
If he don't do better next time, he's finished.

261
00:21:06,148 --> 00:21:08,606
<i>Sugar was still totally shameless. </i>

262
00:21:08,953 --> 00:21:11,216
<i>It never occurred to her
that this was her fault,</i>

263
00:21:11,217 --> 00:21:14,596
<i>that her crabs had put my family in crisis.</i>

264
00:21:15,302 --> 00:21:18,442
Fucking hell. A virgin with an STD.

265
00:21:21,451 --> 00:21:23,455
It's always the same with you, innit, Kim ?

266
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,356
All the pain without the pleasure.

267
00:21:30,036 --> 00:21:32,720
- Did you do yourself ?
- Yes.

268
00:21:33,082 --> 00:21:35,232
- Are you sure ?
- Yes.

269
00:21:35,824 --> 00:21:38,049
Well, not very well, by the looks of things.

270
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:45,175
Right. Togs off.

271
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,859
Come on. l'll do the difficult bits.

272
00:21:51,149 --> 00:21:52,997
I'm not having you giving it back to me.

273
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:58,793
<i>She was living proof
that no matter how bad things are,</i>

274
00:22:02,852 --> 00:22:06,946
<i>you could turn any situation
to your advantage.</i>

275
00:22:14,515 --> 00:22:15,787
Are my hands too cold ?

276
00:22:15,844 --> 00:22:17,654
No. No, they're fine.

277
00:22:17,827 --> 00:22:19,827
Can you just go further down my back ?

278
00:22:20,493 --> 00:22:21,426
There ?

279
00:22:21,482 --> 00:22:22,049
Just a bit more.

280
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,025
There ?

281
00:22:23,026 --> 00:22:28,026
