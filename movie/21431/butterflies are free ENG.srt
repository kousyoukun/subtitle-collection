10
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:53,601
I'm fine, thank you. How are you?

11
00:04:54,874 --> 00:04:56,307
It's warm here.

12
00:04:57,143 --> 00:04:58,872
How is it in Hillsborough?

13
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:01,608
Well, it's warm here, too.

14
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:03,974
Hello, Mother.

15
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,144
<i>-How did you know?</i>
<i>-When you call, the phone doesn't ring.</i>

16
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,381
<i>It says,</i>
<i>"M" is for the million things she gave.</i>

17
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:11,856
<i>"O" is.... I forgot what O is for.</i>

18
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,855
You seemed to have forgotten
a lot of things lately.

19
00:05:14,928 --> 00:05:18,227
-How are you feeling?
-I'm fine, thank you. How are you?

20
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:20,925
<i>Very well. How's the weather?</i>

21
00:05:21,234 --> 00:05:23,566
It's warm here. How's it in Hillsborough?

22
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:25,969
<i>-Warm.</i>
-It's warm here, too.

23
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,940
-How's the apartment?
<i>-Oh, great! I love it.</i>

24
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:32,137
-What'd you do last night?
-Last night? I didn't do anything.

25
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:35,113
I mean, I didn't go out.
I had some friends in.

26
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:37,212
It was just a little party.

27
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:41,052
I don't know how many people there were.

28
00:05:41,287 --> 00:05:43,187
Do you have to have a number?

29
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:46,186
-Twelve and a half. How's that?
-Did they stay late?

30
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,692
<i>They didn't stay too late.</i>

31
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:50,025
-I'd like to come by and see you.
-No!

32
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:53,060
Donnie, I'm coming into town
tomorrow, anyway.

33
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:56,261
-I have to go to Saks.
-I said no, and I mean it.

34
00:05:57,871 --> 00:06:00,169
I don't give a damn, I said no.

35
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,170
Because we had an agreement,
that's why.

36
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:08,681
We agreed to two months.

37
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:11,510
I have one month left
and I want every minute of it.

38
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:15,111
Donnie, you are so irritating.
I could absolutely cry.

39
00:06:15,422 --> 00:06:16,446
<i>What?</i>

40
00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:19,691
-What is that noise?
-It's coming from next door.

41
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:21,757
<i>-Who lives next door?</i>
-A girl.

42
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:23,022
What's her name?

43
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:27,931
I don't know. I haven't met her yet.
I can hardly hear you. Call me tomorrow.

44
00:06:41,414 --> 00:06:44,144
Hey! Will you lower your television?

45
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:46,717
I can't hear you. Wait a minute.

46
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,920
Sorry. I couldn't hear you.

47
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:51,183
Please lower your television.

48
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:53,817
You don't have to turn it off.
Just hold it down.

49
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:56,157
It's not a television. It's a radio.

50
00:06:56,362 --> 00:06:59,525
-Whatever. The walls are like paper.
-I know.

51
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,097
You can practically see through them.

52
00:07:02,235 --> 00:07:03,532
No, not really.

53
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:07,930
Hey, how about a cup of coffee?

54
00:07:08,141 --> 00:07:09,836
No, thank you. I just had some.

55
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:10,807
I meant for me.

56
00:07:12,512 --> 00:07:14,207
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

57
00:07:15,148 --> 00:07:17,013
Okay.

58
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:32,690
It's open.

59
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:37,333
Hi. I'm Jill Tanner.

60
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:40,664
-Don Baker.
-Would you mind zipping up my blouse?

61
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,432
I can't reach back there.
Hope you don't mind my inviting myself in.

62
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:46,706
Not at all. Water will be hot in a minute.

63
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,271
Your living room is much bigger than mine.

64
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:52,376
Nice.

65
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:56,586
-How long have you been here?
-A month. That's not the living room.

66
00:07:56,656 --> 00:07:59,250
That's the whole apartment
plus the bathroom.

67
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:02,053
I've got three rooms,
if you count the kitchen.

68
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:03,761
God, you're neat.

69
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:08,157
Everything's so tidy.

70
00:08:08,334 --> 00:08:10,393
It's easy when you haven't got anything.

71
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,439
I don't have anything,
but it manages to wind up...

72
00:08:13,506 --> 00:08:15,098
...all over the place.

73
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:18,641
I'm afraid I'm a slob.

74
00:08:21,181 --> 00:08:24,708
Oh, hey, I like your skylight.

75
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:27,418
I don't have one.

76
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:29,448
-What's this?
-What?

77
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:31,046
This thing on stilts.

78
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:32,453
That's my bed.

79
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:33,921
Your bed!

80
00:08:34,861 --> 00:08:36,192
Wow!

81
00:08:37,664 --> 00:08:38,926
This is wild!

82
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,423
You like it?

83
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,960
Oh, it's the greatest bed I've ever seen,
and I've seen a lot of beds.

84
00:08:45,972 --> 00:08:47,132
Did you build it?

85
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:49,835
No, some hippies lived here before me.
They built it.

86
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:51,433
Suppose you fall out?

87
00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:54,274
Gee, you could break something.

88
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:56,838
You could break something
falling out of any bed.

89
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,076
That's true.

90
00:08:58,384 --> 00:09:01,251
I could've had your apartment.
I took this one for the bed.

91
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:02,845
Cream or sugar?

92
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:05,857
Just black, thanks.

93
00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:12,663
-Here you go.
-Thanks. This coffee will save my life.

94
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,628
I bought flowers and dumb things
like dishtowels, paper napkins...

95
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:19,171
...but I forgot coffee.

96
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,833
You need any dishtowels or paper napkins?

97
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:23,739
No.

98
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,741
I got some light bulbs, too.

99
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,772
May I ask you a personal question?

100
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:29,746
Yeah, sure.

101
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:32,717
-Why don't you want your mother here?
-How'd you know that?

102
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:35,185
Well, if you can hear me, I can hear you.

103
00:09:35,255 --> 00:09:38,486
I guess the sound must come right up
from under that door.

104
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:40,422
What's that door for, anyway?

105
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,324
Your apartment and mine
were once one apartment.

106
00:09:43,396 --> 00:09:47,492
When they converted it into two,
they just locked that instead of sealing it.

107
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:51,031
-You didn't answer my question.
-I forgot what you asked.

108
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,365
Why don't you want your mother here?

109
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:55,105
It's a long story.

110
00:09:55,408 --> 00:09:58,343
No, it's a short story.
It's been going on for a long time.

111
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:01,938
She didn't want me to leave home.
She thinks I can't make it on my own.

112
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:04,813
Finally, we agreed letting me try it
for two months.

113
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:08,411
She's to keep away from me
for two months. I got a month to go.

114
00:10:08,988 --> 00:10:11,218
Why did you tell her you had a party?

115
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:14,727
-You don't miss anything in there, do you?
-Very little.

116
00:10:14,994 --> 00:10:17,622
I always tell her I had a party
or that I went to one.

117
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:18,721
She wouldn't understand...

118
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:22,461
...why I'd rather be alone,
than keeping her and the cook company.

119
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:24,660
She's going to hate this place.

120
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:26,967
She hates it now without even seeing it.

121
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,168
She'll walk in and say,
"I could absolutely cry."

122
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,640
-Does she cry a lot?
-No, just threatens to.

123
00:10:32,712 --> 00:10:35,738
If she really wants to cry,
send her in to look at my place.

124
00:10:35,815 --> 00:10:37,339
At least you're neat.

125
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:40,851
You know, you're old enough to live alone.
I'm 19.

126
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:44,320
-How old are you?
-As far as my mother's concerned, I'm 11.

127
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,687
Going on 10.

128
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:48,559
We must have the same mother.

129
00:10:48,761 --> 00:10:53,198
My mother would love for me to stay
a child all my life so she won't age.

130
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,963
She loves it when people say to her
we look like sisters.

131
00:10:57,036 --> 00:10:59,334
And if they don't say it, she tells them.

132
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:00,872
Have you got a job?

133
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:03,340
No, but I play guitar and
I got a few prospects.

134
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:04,398
I know.

135
00:11:05,878 --> 00:11:07,470
I heard you last night.

136
00:11:07,547 --> 00:11:10,516
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-No. It was good. Really!

137
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,685
I thought it was a record
till I kept hearing it over again.

138
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:15,880
I can't read music, so I got to learn by ear.

139
00:11:16,055 --> 00:11:18,580
-I'm trying to put together an act.
-And then what?

140
00:11:18,658 --> 00:11:20,683
I'll try to cash in on some of those ideas.

141
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,490
I know one thing:
I'm not going back to Hillsborough.

142
00:11:23,563 --> 00:11:26,031
-What's Hillsborough?
-You don't know Hillsborough?

143
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:28,533
I don't know much about
any place up here.

144
00:11:28,601 --> 00:11:31,729
I'm from Los Angeles.
I've never been north of the Big Sur.

145
00:11:31,804 --> 00:11:34,272
Hillsborough is about 10 miles from here.

146
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,171
-Is that where you live?
-No.

147
00:11:36,376 --> 00:11:39,436
-I live here. It's where I used to live.
-All right.

148
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:41,441
What did you say your name was?

149
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:44,042
Jill Tanner.

150
00:11:45,618 --> 00:11:48,086
Technically, I guess I'm Mrs. Benson.

151
00:11:48,888 --> 00:11:51,049
I was married once, when I was 16.

152
00:11:51,124 --> 00:11:52,216
Sixteen?

153
00:11:52,558 --> 00:11:54,287
How long were you married?

154
00:11:56,062 --> 00:11:57,586
It seemed like weeks.

155
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:03,262
Actually, it was six days.

156
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,301
What was he like?

157
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:13,273
I'm sorry.
I really don't want to talk about it.

158
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,670
Then, don't. I'm sorry I asked.

159
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:20,046
No, I'll talk about him.
Once in a while you should do something...

160
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:22,917
...you don't want to do.
It cleanses the insides.

161
00:12:27,193 --> 00:12:29,058
Jack was wild-looking.

162
00:12:30,263 --> 00:12:31,730
Sort of adolescent.

163
00:12:32,331 --> 00:12:34,731
Girls mature faster than boys, don't they?

164
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:39,170
Anyway, we met
and it was like fireworks, rockets.

165
00:12:40,506 --> 00:12:42,599
Every day was like Fourth of July.

166
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:47,077
Then, we were standing
before the justice of the peace...

167
00:12:47,146 --> 00:12:48,511
...getting married.

168
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:52,278
-How long had you known him?
-I don't know, two or three weeks.

169
00:12:53,219 --> 00:12:57,485
But there we were, getting married.
And I wasn't even out of high school yet.

170
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,148
And I had two exams the next day,
and they were on my mind, too.

171
00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:05,153
Then, I heard the justice of the peace say:

172
00:13:05,398 --> 00:13:08,925
"Do you, Jack, take Jill
to be your lawfully wedded wife?"

173
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:14,063
Can you imagine going through life
as Jack and Jill?

174
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,770
And then, I heard him say:

175
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:18,840
"Till death do us part."

176
00:13:20,813 --> 00:13:24,271
Suddenly, it became more like
a funeral service then a wedding ceremony.

177
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,682
-Jesus!
-It was so morbid.

178
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:28,782
I hate anything morbid.

179
00:13:28,855 --> 00:13:31,483
Why didn't you try to make your
marriage work?

180
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:32,524
I did.

181
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:36,423
I did. I tried for six days.

182
00:13:36,963 --> 00:13:40,160
-But I knew it was a mistake.
-Were you in love with him?

183
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:42,426
-In my way.
-What's your way?

184
00:13:42,735 --> 00:13:43,861
I don't know.

185
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:46,962
Just because you love someone
doesn't necessarily mean...

186
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,008
...you want to spend
the rest of your life with them.

187
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:52,109
And Jack loved me.

188
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:55,803
I mean, he really loved me.

189
00:13:56,516 --> 00:14:00,316
And I hurt him.
That's just what I can't stand.

190
00:14:00,586 --> 00:14:02,713
I just never want to hurt anybody.

191
00:14:03,923 --> 00:14:06,084
Marriage is a commitment, isn't it?

192
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:08,717
And I just can't be committed or involved.

193
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:10,425
Can you understand?

194
00:14:11,164 --> 00:14:13,655
Yeah, I can understand, but I don't agree.

195
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:16,232
Well, then, you really don't understand.

196
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,267
I thought I was sloppy.

197
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:24,273
What do you mean?

198
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:27,642
Unless you know something I don't,
like ashes are good for the table.

199
00:14:27,713 --> 00:14:30,238
Is that why you keep dropping them
on there?

200
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,111
Did you move the ashtray?

201
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:35,621
-It's right here. What, are you blind?
-Yes.

202
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:41,889
-What do you mean, "Yes"?
-I mean, yes, I'm blind.

203
00:14:48,434 --> 00:14:51,597
Oh, you're putting me on. Don't do that.

204
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:54,537
No, I'm blind. I've always been blind.

205
00:14:59,512 --> 00:15:01,070
You mean, really blind?

206
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:03,305
Not just nearsighted?

207
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,608
The works. I can't see a thing.

208
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:32,575
Oh, God! I hope I didn't say anything.

209
00:15:32,678 --> 00:15:35,511
Wait a minute.
Don't get self-conscious about it. I'm not.

210
00:15:35,581 --> 00:15:37,742
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I just did.

211
00:15:37,817 --> 00:15:40,377
-But I mean, when I came in.
-You didn't ask me.

212
00:15:40,453 --> 00:15:41,715
Why would I ask you?

213
00:15:41,787 --> 00:15:43,721
I don't walk into somebody's house,
saying:

214
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:45,950
"Hi, I'm Jill Tanner. Are you blind?"

215
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:48,994
I don't meet someone and say,
"Don Baker. Blind as a bat."

216
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:52,462
I still think you should've told me.
I would've told you.

217
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:54,759
I wanted to see how long it'd take you
to catch on.

218
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:56,062
Oh, God!

219
00:15:56,936 --> 00:15:59,871
When I saw you standing at the window
all that time.

220
00:16:00,072 --> 00:16:02,199
It's the coolest spot in the room.

221
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:06,036
I thought you were a peeping Tom.

222
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,070
That's what I call positive thinking.

223
00:16:09,148 --> 00:16:12,049
You know, I nearIy called the police.
Suppose I had?

224
00:16:12,585 --> 00:16:14,712
Well, they would've locked you up.

225
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:21,853
You're so cool. So adjusted.

226
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:25,330
No, I'm not. I never had to adjust.
I was born blind.

227
00:16:25,398 --> 00:16:28,094
It'd be different if I'd been able to see
then went blind.

228
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,964
For me, blindness is normal.

229
00:16:30,036 --> 00:16:32,766
I was 6 before I found out
everybody else wasn't blind.

230
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:36,672
By then it didn't make any difference.
So, let's relax, okay?

231
00:16:36,742 --> 00:16:39,768
You know, if we can have a few laughs,
so much the better.

232
00:16:39,979 --> 00:16:41,446
A few laughs?

233
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:44,140
About blindness?

234
00:16:44,817 --> 00:16:47,081
No, not about blindness.

235
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:49,579
Can't you forget that?

236
00:16:50,122 --> 00:16:52,920
Well, you're the first blind person
I ever met.

237
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:55,988
Too bad they don't give out prizes for that.

238
00:16:56,062 --> 00:16:59,327
I've seen blind men on the street,
and everything, with dogs...

239
00:16:59,398 --> 00:17:01,525
...but why don't you have a dog?

240
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:04,668
They attract too much attention.
I'd rather do it myself.

241
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:07,797
Don't you have trouble
getting around San Francisco?

242
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:11,707
-I mean, it's tough for me.
-No, I manage very well with my cane.

243
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:16,109
I know exactly how many steps
to the laundry, drugstore, and delicatessen.

244
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,248
Where's the laundry? I need one.

245
00:17:19,385 --> 00:17:20,909
Near the delicatessen.

246
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:23,853
Outside, turn right,
and it's 44 steps from the front door.

247
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:25,948
-I didn't see it.
-I'll show you.

248
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:28,492
You'll show....

249
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:31,387
Wow!

250
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:35,827
What about your apartment?
Don't you bang into things?

251
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:38,836
-You could hurt yourself.
-No, I memorized the room.

252
00:17:39,338 --> 00:17:41,829
Bed. Guitar.

253
00:17:43,843 --> 00:17:45,276
Bathroom.

254
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:51,983
Jacket. My cane. Front door.

255
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:54,508
Bookcase.

256
00:17:55,154 --> 00:17:57,679
Wine, glasses, chest of drawers.

257
00:17:58,224 --> 00:17:59,953
-Linens.
-What are these books?

258
00:18:00,025 --> 00:18:04,587
Braille. Dining table.

259
00:18:05,064 --> 00:18:06,224
Bathtub.

260
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:10,428
Kitchen.

261
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:17,540
Ketchup. Oil. Salt. Pepper.
Sugar. Coffee.

262
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:20,340
-Gee!
-Now, if you'll just put the ashtray back.

263
00:18:27,286 --> 00:18:28,253
Voila!

264
00:18:28,487 --> 00:18:31,615
As long as you don't move anything
I'm as good as anybody else.

265
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:36,127
Better. I can't find anything in my place.

266
00:18:36,595 --> 00:18:39,063
If you really want to see chaos,
come look at....

267
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:40,621
Oh, I'm sorry.

268
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:45,501
-I meant....
-I know what you mean.

269
00:18:45,704 --> 00:18:48,639
I'm no different from anybody else,
except I don't see.

270
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:52,006
The blindness doesn't bother me
as much as other people's reaction.

271
00:18:52,077 --> 00:18:54,102
If they'd only behave naturally.

272
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,441
Some people assume guilt,
which they can't...

273
00:18:56,515 --> 00:18:59,143
...because my mother
has that market cornered.

274
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:00,808
So, just be yourself.

275
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,212
Well, I always thought
that blind people were...

276
00:19:05,224 --> 00:19:07,317
...you know, kind of spooky.

277
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:10,489
But of course.

278
00:19:11,096 --> 00:19:14,293
We sleep all day hanging upside-down
from the shower rod.

279
00:19:14,366 --> 00:19:17,301
When it's dark we wake up
and fly in through people's windows.

280
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:19,360
That's why they say, "Blind as a bat."

281
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:21,963
No, I'm serious. Now be serious.

282
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:25,339
Don't blind people have a sixth sense?

283
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:28,572
No. If I had six senses,
I'd still only have five, wouldn't I?

284
00:19:28,647 --> 00:19:31,013
And my other senses,
hearing, taste and touch...

285
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,951
...might be a little more developed
than yours because I use them more.

286
00:19:35,187 --> 00:19:36,882
I'll show you something.

287
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:39,254
Spin me around.

288
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:45,487
No, I mean really spin me.

289
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,839
-There's something in front of me.
-The window.

290
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:02,177
That's wild. How'd you do that?

291
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:05,181
-It's called shadow vision.
-What's shadow vision?

292
00:20:05,584 --> 00:20:08,883
It's being able to sense that
there's a solid object in front of you.

293
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:12,481
You can feel it. It's a warning.
Sighted people can do it, too...

294
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:15,391
-...but blind people can do it better.
-I want to try it.

295
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:25,868
Ouch! My....

296
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:29,701
There are advantages to being blind.

297
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:33,811
Oh, I think it's so great you're not bitter.

298
00:20:34,547 --> 00:20:36,981
You don't seem to have
any bitterness at all.

299
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:39,847
I know I'd be terribly bitter if I couldn't see.

300
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:42,520
-I know I'd be disagreeable.
-I doubt it.

301
00:20:42,821 --> 00:20:46,154
Oh, no. I couldn't be cheerful like you.

302
00:20:46,392 --> 00:20:50,556
I don't have any of those marvelous
qualities like courage and fortitude.

303
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:53,659
Well, neither do I.
I'm just naturally adorable.

304
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:55,730
You're a lot more than that.

305
00:20:56,435 --> 00:20:58,369
You're a very superior person.

306
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:00,799
Oh, yeah. I'm fantastic.

307
00:21:01,307 --> 00:21:04,242
"I would not go gentle into that good night

308
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:08,344
"I would rage
against the dying of the light"

309
00:21:09,448 --> 00:21:10,676
Dylan Thomas.

310
00:21:11,016 --> 00:21:13,712
-Who?
-It's a line from a poem by Dylan Thomas.

311
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:15,179
It is?

312
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:18,048
You mean I can quote Dylan Thomas?

313
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,687
How about that? I never even read him.

314
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:25,462
I don't know where I learned it.
I can quote Mark Twain.

315
00:21:25,898 --> 00:21:28,366
My favorite quotation is by Mark Twain.

316
00:21:28,434 --> 00:21:30,231
-You want to hear it?
-Go.

317
00:21:33,472 --> 00:21:35,372
"I only ask to be free.

318
00:21:36,408 --> 00:21:38,399
"The butterflies are free.

319
00:21:38,978 --> 00:21:42,414
"Mankind will surely not deny
to Harold Skimpole...

320
00:21:42,982 --> 00:21:45,314
"...what it concedes to the butterflies.'

321
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,081
I identify strongly with butterflies.
Do you like it?

322
00:21:52,157 --> 00:21:55,285
Yes, very much,
except it wasn't written by Mark Twain.

323
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:58,155
-Why not?
-It was written by Dickens.

324
00:21:58,263 --> 00:21:59,525
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

325
00:21:59,598 --> 00:22:02,863
Harold Skimpole is a character
in <i>Bleak House</i> by Dickens.

326
00:22:02,968 --> 00:22:05,493
Oh, I never read Dickens.

327
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:11,008
Actually, I never read Mark Twain either,
but I always thought he wrote that.

328
00:22:11,877 --> 00:22:16,007
Have you read.... Oh, God!

329
00:22:16,081 --> 00:22:18,777
I have read Dickens
and I've read most of Mark Twain...

330
00:22:18,851 --> 00:22:22,287
...and stop falling apart at every word.
They're published in Braille.

331
00:22:22,354 --> 00:22:25,414
It's awful to ask someone
who's blind if he's read something.

332
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:26,617
Not at all.

333
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:29,293
Actually, I read very well
with my fingertips.

334
00:22:29,361 --> 00:22:32,057
Just ask me
if I've felt any good books lately.

335
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:35,826
-Does anybody ever read to you?
-Yeah, magazines and newspapers.

336
00:22:36,935 --> 00:22:40,063
-Could I read to you sometime?
-If you feel like it.

337
00:22:40,906 --> 00:22:45,639
-What kind of magazines do you like?
-<i>Time</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, <i>Berkeley Barb</i>.

338
00:22:46,311 --> 00:22:48,245
I like to know what's going on.

339
00:22:48,313 --> 00:22:51,373
I should read those, too.
I never know what's going on.

340
00:22:51,617 --> 00:22:54,450
-I guess I don't really care.
-Now, don't say that.

341
00:22:54,787 --> 00:22:57,153
I mean, animals care, vegetables don't.

342
00:22:57,356 --> 00:23:00,223
You have to care about something
or you're nothing.

343
00:23:00,526 --> 00:23:01,618
Food.

344
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:04,625
-Food?
-I care about it deeply.

345
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,956
I'm hungry.

346
00:23:06,131 --> 00:23:08,895
How about freedom?
You care about being free, don't you?

347
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:13,427
Freedom is the most important thing
in the world to me, after I've eaten.

348
00:23:14,306 --> 00:23:16,297
-Help yourself.
-Okay. Thanks.

349
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:19,409
My appetite embarrasses me.

350
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:23,375
You have to know a lot about things
to care about them.

351
00:23:23,449 --> 00:23:27,681
-I don't know much about anything.
-You don't like yourself very much, do you?

352
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:29,048
Why do you say that?

353
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:31,646
Because you're always
putting yourself down.

354
00:23:31,824 --> 00:23:33,849
Let's say I know my limitations.

355
00:23:35,294 --> 00:23:38,627
You have a lot more potential
than you give yourself credit for.

356
00:23:38,697 --> 00:23:41,825
-Just keep telling me that.
-No, just keep telling yourself that.

357
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:50,307
"I knew the day you met me I could

358
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:52,775
"love you if you let me

359
00:23:52,845 --> 00:23:55,575
"though you touched my cheek and said

360
00:23:55,647 --> 00:24:00,175
"how easy you'd forget me, you said

361
00:24:02,554 --> 00:24:05,751
"Butterflies are free

362
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,896
"and so are we"

363
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,698
That's wild!

364
00:24:15,768 --> 00:24:17,531
That's the song you sing all the time.

365
00:24:17,603 --> 00:24:18,968
-You like it?
-I love it.

366
00:24:19,037 --> 00:24:20,061
I wrote it.

367
00:24:20,139 --> 00:24:24,906
I could never get those last lines right,
but I really like that thing about butterflies.

368
00:24:25,277 --> 00:24:28,178
"Butterflies are free

369
00:24:33,252 --> 00:24:35,152
"and so are we"

370
00:24:45,998 --> 00:24:47,795
Oh, that's fantastic.

371
00:24:48,634 --> 00:24:52,161
I know a little bit about music.
I studied it in school.

372
00:24:52,471 --> 00:24:56,032
-Did you finish school?
-I finished high school. Just.

373
00:24:57,509 --> 00:24:59,670
My mother wanted me to go to college.

374
00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:03,442
I was going to go to UCLA,
but I couldn't find a place to park.

375
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:08,610
-You ought to make a record, an album.
-Well, I'm waiting to be discovered.

376
00:25:08,921 --> 00:25:12,982
Well, after you get discovered,
when you're playing somewhere...

377
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:16,053
...are you going to dress like this?

378
00:25:17,162 --> 00:25:20,598
I'd never really thought about it.
Something's wrong with my clothes?

379
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:22,998
They look as though your mother
bought them.

380
00:25:23,068 --> 00:25:24,558
That bad?

381
00:25:24,903 --> 00:25:28,100
Well, I guess it depends on
where you're playing.

382
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:31,233
I mean, they're fine
if you're going to play in a bank.

383
00:25:32,044 --> 00:25:34,569
You ought to wear something
a little more liberated.

384
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:36,580
My mother does buy my clothes.

385
00:25:36,648 --> 00:25:39,811
I'd love to pick out
something really wild for you.

386
00:25:39,885 --> 00:25:42,513
-Like when?
-I don't know. Whenever you like.

387
00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:44,055
-How about now?
-Right now?

388
00:25:44,122 --> 00:25:45,453
-Yeah.
-Okay.

389
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:47,855
I don't have anything to do. Come on.

390
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,694
-Won't you take your cane?
-I'm going to take your arm.

391
00:25:57,769 --> 00:25:59,896
-You can see, can't you?
-Oh, yeah.

392
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:02,999
Wait right there. I got to get my bag.

393
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:25,695
Be careful.

394
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:43,880
Forty-four. Hey, you're right.
It's 44 steps to the laundry.

395
00:26:44,116 --> 00:26:45,549
What made you come here?

396
00:26:45,617 --> 00:26:47,744
I wanted to try something different.

397
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:50,754
-Do you think you'll stay?
-I don't really think about it.

398
00:26:50,822 --> 00:26:53,950
I'll see how it goes. I may be an actress.

399
00:26:54,293 --> 00:26:56,261
I say, "I may." I'll know tomorrow.

400
00:26:56,328 --> 00:26:59,661
I'm auditioning for a part in a new play
with a theater group...

401
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:01,665
...called the Cosmic Workshop.

402
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:05,336
It's about a girl who gets all hung-up
when she marries a homosexual.

403
00:27:05,404 --> 00:27:07,167
Originally, he was an alcoholic...

404
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:10,037
...but homosexuals are very in
now in movies...

405
00:27:10,108 --> 00:27:12,633
...and books and plays, so they changed it.

406
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:16,070
Are you homosexual?

407
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:17,812
No, just blind.

408
00:27:19,584 --> 00:27:22,451
-Careful, there's a step.
-Up or down?

409
00:27:23,021 --> 00:27:23,680
Down!

410
00:27:25,357 --> 00:27:27,291
One of my best friends is gay.

411
00:27:27,426 --> 00:27:29,394
Dennis. He's a designer.

412
00:27:29,695 --> 00:27:32,255
He's good, too.
He made this blouse for me.

413
00:27:32,531 --> 00:27:34,260
I'm sure it's very pretty.

414
00:27:36,835 --> 00:27:40,566
Actually, he made it for himself,
but I talked him out of it.

415
00:27:41,073 --> 00:27:43,541
Dennis is so campy and funny.

416
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,873
But I don't like lesbians.
They're so heavy and humorless.

417
00:27:49,715 --> 00:27:52,377
The director is my friend.
He thinks I can do the part.

418
00:27:52,451 --> 00:27:55,386
-I just have to be approved by the author.
-Who's the director?

419
00:27:55,454 --> 00:27:58,184
You wouldn't know him.
His name is Ralph Santori.

420
00:27:58,256 --> 00:28:01,453
He's from L.A.
He's done a lot of little theater there...

421
00:28:01,526 --> 00:28:03,221
...but never had a hit...

422
00:28:03,295 --> 00:28:06,856
...so he came up here because he got a job
with the Cosmic Workshop.

423
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,626
We kind of made it together for a while,
but then he wanted to get married...

424
00:28:11,703 --> 00:28:14,069
...and I just couldn't face that again.

425
00:28:14,373 --> 00:28:15,863
Were you in love with him?

426
00:28:15,941 --> 00:28:19,240
I don't really think
I've ever been in love with anybody.

427
00:28:19,678 --> 00:28:23,876
I don't want to be. It's too confining.
Somebody always gets hurt.

428
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:27,481
Hey, let's go in here.
They've got wild things.

429
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:29,377
-There are steps.
-Up or down?

430
00:28:29,454 --> 00:28:32,184
Up. I can't think of everything.

431
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:43,461
Hi.

432
00:28:43,735 --> 00:28:46,863
-You need any help?
-No, thanks, we're just looking.

433
00:28:56,982 --> 00:28:58,279
How about this?

434
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:03,012
-No, that's not for you, that's for Dennis.
-Well, it feels nice.

435
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:05,548
-I'll buy it.
-I'll buy it for you.

436
00:29:05,624 --> 00:29:08,320
-No.
-Please, let me buy it for you.

437
00:29:08,393 --> 00:29:10,418
-No.
-I really want to buy it for you.

438
00:29:10,495 --> 00:29:12,463
Okay. Okay.

439
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:16,195
Here, hold this up.

440
00:29:17,903 --> 00:29:19,370
Yeah, it's not bad.

441
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:22,165
Can't we do better than "not bad"?

442
00:29:22,274 --> 00:29:23,468
Okay, wait.

443
00:29:30,382 --> 00:29:31,849
Yeah. Try that on.

444
00:29:36,855 --> 00:29:38,652
You can take my shirt, too.

445
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:42,226
Found anything yet?

446
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,828
-Don, this is Mr. Asparagus.
-Hi.

447
00:29:44,896 --> 00:29:48,525
No, my name is Roy Stratton.
The shop is called Asparagus.

448
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,736
I named it that 'cause I always think
of asparagus as being a friendly vegetable.

449
00:29:52,804 --> 00:29:57,468
I mean, you might see one potato,
or one onion, or one corn...

450
00:29:57,876 --> 00:29:59,969
...but you never see one asparagus.

451
00:30:00,045 --> 00:30:04,573
-They come in bunches. They're involved.
-You never see one pea.

452
00:30:06,451 --> 00:30:08,146
Well, I don't like peas.

453
00:30:08,887 --> 00:30:11,583
Hey, this vest will look great with it.

454
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:14,789
-Here, try it on.
-Yeah.

455
00:30:14,893 --> 00:30:16,520
Give me your other arm.

456
00:30:16,995 --> 00:30:17,859
Okay.

457
00:30:20,432 --> 00:30:22,832
Yeah, now, that's together. I like that.

458
00:30:23,635 --> 00:30:25,330
-Sweet.
-I love it.

459
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,563
-Does it look like an album cover?
-Yeah.

460
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:30,437
Hey, but what you need is a hat.
Hats are big now.

461
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:33,405
-What kind of hat?
-Say, baby, we got everything here.

462
00:30:33,478 --> 00:30:34,604
Over here.

463
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,914
How about a Confederate cap?
We sell a lot of these.

464
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,890
Yeah, I've seen a lot of them.

465
00:30:47,592 --> 00:30:49,082
Now, I like this one.

466
00:30:49,561 --> 00:30:50,960
What do you think?

467
00:30:51,363 --> 00:30:52,887
No, I don't think so.

468
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:56,394
Oh, just a minute.

469
00:30:56,701 --> 00:30:58,328
Hey, how about this?

470
00:30:58,537 --> 00:31:01,199
-A Tyrollean hat.
-A Tyrollean hat?

471
00:31:01,273 --> 00:31:03,366
-Well.
-Yeah, that looks good.

472
00:31:04,543 --> 00:31:07,034
I like that. Take a look at yourself.

473
00:31:11,082 --> 00:31:15,314
-What do you think?
-No. It makes me look like Heidi.

474
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:20,780
I got just the thing for you.
Now, it's one of a kind, if I can find it.

475
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,556
Here it is. How about that?

476
00:31:25,597 --> 00:31:28,691
-What is it?
-It's a cap from the French Foreign Legion.

477
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:30,098
I love it.

478
00:31:34,706 --> 00:31:37,675
Perfect fit.
Man, you were born with that hat on.

479
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:39,709
Hey, take a look at yourself.

480
00:31:42,113 --> 00:31:43,341
In the mirror.

481
00:31:49,387 --> 00:31:52,618
-Hey, is he--
-Yes, he is. And stop whispering.

482
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,323
-Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't--
-Why, man? It's not your fault.

483
00:31:58,396 --> 00:32:00,887
Don't make a big thing out of it. We don't.

484
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:03,628
-How much is the hat?
-It's on the house. A souvenir.

485
00:32:03,702 --> 00:32:06,535
How much is it?
And the shirt, the vest, and Jill's blouse?

486
00:32:06,605 --> 00:32:10,405
Hey, they've got the <i>Berkeley Barb</i>.
We'll take one of these, too.

487
00:32:11,743 --> 00:32:13,472
Do you have any dirty books?

488
00:32:13,545 --> 00:32:14,409
No.

489
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,616
Too bad. That's the only thing
they don't publish in Braille.

490
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:22,944
I guess it was the idea of someone blind
asking for dirty books.

491
00:32:25,557 --> 00:32:28,253
You mean, it would've been all right
if I were sighted?

492
00:32:28,326 --> 00:32:32,057
I don't know.
Anyway, you sure threw him into shock.

493
00:32:32,297 --> 00:32:34,492
-What about you?
-Me?

494
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:37,694
I've been in shock since I met you.

495
00:32:39,104 --> 00:32:42,699
Could you come out of it long enough
to have dinner with me tonight?

496
00:32:42,774 --> 00:32:44,901
For dinner, I'd come out of a coma.

497
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,508
Are you sure we got enough for dinner?
Salami, coleslaw and potato salad.

498
00:32:53,585 --> 00:32:54,950
All my favorites.

499
00:32:56,288 --> 00:32:59,223
-Can I do something?
-Tablecloth in the chest of drawers.

500
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:01,919
-You can set the table.
-Let's not eat at the table.

501
00:33:01,993 --> 00:33:05,292
Salami and potato salad and stuff,
that's not table food.

502
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,458
Let's eat on the floor and have a picnic.

503
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,367
I got a better idea.

504
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:12,369
-Let's go to the beach.
-The beach?

505
00:33:12,437 --> 00:33:16,066
Yeah, I know a little stretch of sand
where hardly anybody ever goes.

506
00:33:16,141 --> 00:33:18,632
-Where?
-Over there by the dining table.

507
00:33:19,477 --> 00:33:22,241
-You can see better if you're blind.
-Oh, really?

508
00:33:22,314 --> 00:33:25,010
Then how come you didn't notice
the tide came in?

509
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:26,573
I see a much better place.

510
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:28,209
-Where?
-By the bed.

511
00:33:28,887 --> 00:33:30,354
Perfect.

512
00:33:38,997 --> 00:33:41,659
-Is blindness hereditary?
-I never heard that.

513
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,827
-Can your father see?
-I doubt it. He's been dead for six years.

514
00:33:45,904 --> 00:33:48,202
Till then
he didn't have any trouble, though.

515
00:33:48,273 --> 00:33:50,639
-I bet you miss him.
-Yeah, I do.

516
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:53,234
He was the only friend I had
when I was growing up.

517
00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:54,778
We were very close.

518
00:33:54,979 --> 00:33:58,312
It's been rough on Mom since he died
because she's had to be both...

519
00:33:58,383 --> 00:34:01,284
...mother and father.
And sister and brother.

520
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,249
And doctor and lawyer,
and congressman, congresswoman.

521
00:34:04,322 --> 00:34:05,812
Rabbi, priest, padre.

522
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:08,415
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do knives go on the left or the right?

523
00:34:08,493 --> 00:34:09,983
-On the right.
-Okay.

524
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:15,494
Why were you born blind?
Did the doctor say why?

525
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:19,461
They said it was a virus in the womb,
which means they don't know.

526
00:34:19,904 --> 00:34:23,465
You know, I heard that women
with syphilis give birth to blind babies.

527
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:25,736
Could your mother have had syphilis?

528
00:34:29,681 --> 00:34:32,013
You meet her, then tell me what you think.

529
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:33,744
When will that be?

530
00:34:34,152 --> 00:34:35,278
In a month.

531
00:34:35,954 --> 00:34:38,980
I've got a month before she comes here
to see what's going on.

532
00:34:39,057 --> 00:34:42,356
As the clock strikes month,
she's going to walk in that door.

533
00:34:42,427 --> 00:34:44,793
You may have heard of her.
She wrote some books.

534
00:34:44,863 --> 00:34:46,694
Her name's Florence Baker.

535
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:50,596
No, it's not familiar,
but you can't go by me.

536
00:34:50,802 --> 00:34:53,270
I may even be quoting her
and I wouldn't know it.

537
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:56,569
She wrote a series of children's books.
Guess what they're about?

538
00:34:56,641 --> 00:34:58,006
Children?

539
00:34:58,076 --> 00:35:01,477
They were all about a blind kid
named Little Donnie Dark.

540
00:35:01,746 --> 00:35:04,112
-Little Donnie Dark?
-That's me.

541
00:35:04,182 --> 00:35:07,481
-You'll say anything to get attention.
-No, it's true, I swear.

542
00:35:07,552 --> 00:35:09,543
I hate that name, Donnie.

543
00:35:12,123 --> 00:35:14,023
Tell me when I hit the beach.

544
00:35:14,626 --> 00:35:16,116
Stop!

545
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,062
This is the first time I've eaten on the floor.

546
00:35:21,132 --> 00:35:22,622
It's so practical.

547
00:35:23,468 --> 00:35:27,734
You can sit in so many different positions.
You can even lie down, if you like.

548
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:29,934
Tables are so confining.

549
00:35:30,175 --> 00:35:31,506
Like love?

550
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:36,111
Yes, and I never knew what to do
with my elbows.

551
00:35:37,782 --> 00:35:39,306
Something is missing.

552
00:35:41,553 --> 00:35:42,520
I know.

553
00:35:42,587 --> 00:35:44,578
-Where are you going?
-You'll see.

554
00:36:01,172 --> 00:36:02,400
Flowers.

555
00:36:02,974 --> 00:36:05,704
I thought it would add
just a touch of elegance.

556
00:36:06,711 --> 00:36:09,236
Now, tell me more
about Little Donnie Dark.

557
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:11,210
It might curb my appetite.

558
00:36:11,649 --> 00:36:14,550
Donnie is 12 years old.
And he was born blind, like me...

559
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:17,019
...but that's no handicap
for Little Donnie Dark.

560
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:20,455
He can drive cars. He flies planes
because his other faculties...

561
00:36:20,525 --> 00:36:24,017
...are so highly developed. He can hear
a bank being robbed a mile away.

562
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:26,791
He can smell the Communists
cooking a rebellious plot.

563
00:36:26,865 --> 00:36:30,528
He's a diligent fighter of crime, injustice,
and at the end of every book...

564
00:36:30,602 --> 00:36:34,402
...as he is being given a medal
by the police or the FBI, he always says:

565
00:36:34,472 --> 00:36:37,703
"There are none so blind
as those who will not see!"

566
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,005
I'm taking some more of your salami.

567
00:36:41,779 --> 00:36:44,577
Since when do the police and the FBI
give out medals?

568
00:36:44,649 --> 00:36:46,514
Since my mother says they do.

569
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:50,785
-Let's have a drink.
-All I've got is wine.

570
00:36:50,855 --> 00:36:52,948
-That's all I drink.
-With salami?

571
00:36:53,057 --> 00:36:54,388
With everything.

572
00:36:55,693 --> 00:36:57,558
Do children really read those books?

573
00:36:57,629 --> 00:37:00,894
I'm counting so I don't step in the picnic
on the way back.

574
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,767
You have just finished your salami.

575
00:37:11,643 --> 00:37:13,076
Does she still write them?

576
00:37:13,144 --> 00:37:15,669
No. She wrote six of them
when I was a kid.

577
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,409
They were no <i>Mary Poppins</i>,
but pretty popular unless you are blind.

578
00:37:19,484 --> 00:37:21,850
They didn't exactly tell it like it is.

579
00:37:25,156 --> 00:37:28,216
I guess they were a projection
of what she hoped I'd be.

580
00:37:28,593 --> 00:37:30,493
Sort of a sightless superman.

581
00:37:31,129 --> 00:37:33,859
Did you have to go to any special school
or anything?

582
00:37:33,932 --> 00:37:36,492
I went to a regular school.
When I finished there...

583
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:38,468
...nothing happened to me until a year ago.

584
00:37:38,536 --> 00:37:40,265
What happened a year ago?

585
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:43,307
A family named Fletcher moved near us.

586
00:37:43,374 --> 00:37:45,672
Their daughter Linda used to read to me.

587
00:37:45,743 --> 00:37:47,870
She was the first close friend I had.

588
00:37:47,946 --> 00:37:50,881
She was fantastic and wild.

589
00:37:51,215 --> 00:37:55,276
She used to drive me here all the time
and take me to all kinds of parties.

590
00:37:56,154 --> 00:38:00,591
Linda gave me something that nobody else
had thought to give me: confidence.

591
00:38:00,825 --> 00:38:02,417
It changed my whole life.

592
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,590
She talked me into leaving home.

593
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:10,499
She found this apartment for me.
At first, I was scared to death.

594
00:38:11,502 --> 00:38:12,730
But I did it.

595
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:18,435
-Maybe it was a mistake. I don't know.
-No. No, it wasn't.

596
00:38:19,177 --> 00:38:21,111
You'd have to do it sometime.

597
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:23,608
What's happened to Linda?

598
00:38:24,282 --> 00:38:28,616
She flipped for a painter we met at a party
and went to live with him in Mexico.

599
00:38:29,087 --> 00:38:32,022
I wish she were here.
It would make it a lot easier.

600
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,314
Well, I'm here.

601
00:38:35,226 --> 00:38:38,787
I'm right next door.
Anytime you need me, just knock.

602
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:43,466
You don't even have to knock.
You just have to whisper and I'll hear you.

603
00:38:45,937 --> 00:38:48,633
Hey, you know what?
Why don't we open that door?

604
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,604
-Which door?
-That door to my apartment.

605
00:38:51,876 --> 00:38:53,639
There must be a key.

606
00:38:54,479 --> 00:38:55,912
Let's unlock it.

607
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,575
Then we can go back and forth
without having to run down the hall.

608
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:03,178
The janitor probably has a key,
but I don't think we ought to ask him.

609
00:39:03,254 --> 00:39:06,417
-I don't think we should do that.
-Why not? We're friends, right?

610
00:39:06,491 --> 00:39:08,823
Yeah, but we'd be practically
living together.

611
00:39:08,893 --> 00:39:10,292
How would it look?

612
00:39:12,664 --> 00:39:15,155
Who cares how it looks?
I can't see anyway.

613
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:20,701
I bet we can open it with this sharp knife.

614
00:39:20,772 --> 00:39:24,037
-We'll have to move the chest.
-Okay. Move it towards you.

615
00:39:27,545 --> 00:39:29,012
There. That's fine.

616
00:39:35,853 --> 00:39:36,842
Damn it!

617
00:39:39,257 --> 00:39:42,522
-Well, We'll have to call the janitor.
-Let me try.

618
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:59,743
You did it! It's open!

619
00:40:00,378 --> 00:40:03,575
-Don't look! It's an absolute pigsty!
-I won't.

620
00:40:04,615 --> 00:40:06,082
God, I'm sorry.

621
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:08,649
I'm sorry.

622
00:40:10,588 --> 00:40:12,249
I'll get the hang of it.

623
00:40:12,657 --> 00:40:14,284
I just don't know when.

624
00:40:15,993 --> 00:40:17,688
Oh, let's leave it open.

625
00:40:19,397 --> 00:40:22,628
Okay, but tell me if you close it,
so I don't break my nose.

626
00:40:24,469 --> 00:40:27,438
Do you wish it were Linda living there
instead of me?

627
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,508
I hadn't thought about it. Why do you ask?

628
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:36,478
I just wondered
if you were still in love with her.

629
00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:39,207
Did I say I was in love with her?

630
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:44,846
If I get too personal, tell me to shut up.

631
00:40:45,857 --> 00:40:47,586
I get carried away.

632
00:40:53,064 --> 00:40:54,793
Were you in love with her?

633
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,628
Are you?

634
00:40:59,637 --> 00:41:02,572
I think every man should have
some mystery about him.

635
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,130
And that'll be mine.

636
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:08,376
-What's she like?
-She's very pretty.

637
00:41:10,014 --> 00:41:11,379
How do you know?

638
00:41:11,883 --> 00:41:15,284
I can feel a person's face
and get a good idea what they look like.

639
00:41:15,353 --> 00:41:17,480
I can tell by shapes and textures.

640
00:41:18,656 --> 00:41:20,920
-Do you wonder what I look like?
-Yes.

641
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:23,290
I'm gorgeous.

642
00:41:23,928 --> 00:41:25,225
Are you really?

643
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,698
I wouldn't lie about something like that.

644
00:41:31,035 --> 00:41:34,903
I've always thought if I could see for
half a minute then I could see how I look.

645
00:41:34,972 --> 00:41:40,308
I'll tell you. Cute and very sexy.

646
00:41:49,754 --> 00:41:51,483
Your hair's very soft.

647
00:41:53,024 --> 00:41:54,321
It's very long.

648
00:41:55,893 --> 00:41:57,155
Jesus!

649
00:41:57,962 --> 00:42:00,294
-Oh, don't be frightened.
-What happened?

650
00:42:00,364 --> 00:42:03,800
Nothing. It's called a fall.

651
00:42:04,168 --> 00:42:06,864
It's a long piece of hair
you attach to your head.

652
00:42:06,938 --> 00:42:09,338
-Not your hair?
-It's not even my fall.

653
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,101
I borrowed it from Susan Potter.
I do have my own hair.

654
00:42:13,277 --> 00:42:15,302
See? I mean, feel.

655
00:42:24,121 --> 00:42:25,952
Oh, God! Now what?

656
00:42:26,624 --> 00:42:28,421
It's just an eyelash.

657
00:42:29,093 --> 00:42:30,754
You don't have eyelashes?

658
00:42:30,828 --> 00:42:34,764
Of course, but these just make
my eyes look bigger.

659
00:42:34,832 --> 00:42:37,392
They're longer than mine.
Didn't Linda wear them?

660
00:42:37,468 --> 00:42:38,492
No.

661
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:42,237
She probably had naturally long lashes.
I hate her.

662
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:44,968
Come on.

663
00:42:46,444 --> 00:42:50,437
-This is scaring the hell out of me.
-Don't worry. It's all real from now on.

664
00:42:54,919 --> 00:42:59,117
-Am I not the image of Elizabeth Taylor?
-I never felt Elizabeth Taylor.

665
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:03,121
We look exactly alike.
Especially if you can't see.

666
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:14,297
That's my breast.

667
00:43:15,907 --> 00:43:16,999
All mine.

668
00:43:18,776 --> 00:43:20,004
Both of them.

669
00:43:32,456 --> 00:43:34,822
-What's wrong?
-What do you think is wrong?

670
00:43:34,892 --> 00:43:36,621
I wouldn't ask if I knew.

671
00:43:36,861 --> 00:43:40,024
Why are you doing this? What is it?

672
00:43:40,097 --> 00:43:42,793
Be Kind to the Handicapped Week,
or something?

673
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,893
You've been feeling sorry for me
ever since you came in here this morning.

674
00:43:47,204 --> 00:43:49,229
Take him shopping, show him a good time.

675
00:43:49,307 --> 00:43:52,401
Get him into the sack
and that'll take care of my social work.

676
00:43:52,476 --> 00:43:54,842
Thanks a lot, but don't patronize me.

677
00:43:56,314 --> 00:43:58,475
Don't you feel sorry for me.

678
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:02,815
Well, let me tell you something, big mouth.

679
00:44:03,587 --> 00:44:06,681
I don't do anything for anybody
I don't want to.

680
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:10,021
And I'll be goddamned
if I'll feel sorry for any guy...

681
00:44:10,094 --> 00:44:13,325
...who's going to go to bed with me.

682
00:44:37,888 --> 00:44:39,685
<i>"I knew the day you met me</i>

683
00:44:40,224 --> 00:44:43,455
<i>"I could love you if you let me</i>

684
00:44:43,527 --> 00:44:47,361
<i>"Though you touched my cheek</i>
<i>and said how</i>

685
00:44:48,065 --> 00:44:50,329
<i>"easy you'd forget me you said</i>

686
00:44:50,401 --> 00:44:54,531
"Butterflies are free"

687
00:44:56,107 --> 00:44:57,199
Jill!

688
00:44:58,309 --> 00:45:00,641
-I'm in here.
-What are you doing?

689
00:45:00,845 --> 00:45:02,870
I'm looking for something.

690
00:45:03,781 --> 00:45:05,078
Oh, here it is.

691
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:07,749
Good morning.

692
00:45:09,153 --> 00:45:10,984
What've you done to your hair?

693
00:45:11,055 --> 00:45:12,420
I just combed it.

694
00:45:13,124 --> 00:45:16,184
-Well, I'll fix it.
-What's wrong with it?

695
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,455
It doesn't go with your new clothes.

696
00:45:18,763 --> 00:45:20,390
I have a present for you.

697
00:45:22,633 --> 00:45:23,861
It's in here.

698
00:45:26,637 --> 00:45:28,901
-Beautiful wood.
-And mother-of-pearl.

699
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:32,471
I take this with me everywhere.

700
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:35,137
Everything that's important to me
is in here.

701
00:45:36,881 --> 00:45:39,179
This is a piece of the moon or a star.

702
00:45:39,517 --> 00:45:42,486
I found it in the desert
and I showed it to this geologist.

703
00:45:42,553 --> 00:45:45,113
He said he'd never seen
any mineral like it on earth.

704
00:45:45,189 --> 00:45:47,487
It probably fell from the moon or a star.

705
00:45:47,558 --> 00:45:50,891
-It feels like a rock.
-Well, it isn't.

706
00:45:53,964 --> 00:45:56,956
And this is one of my baby teeth.

707
00:45:59,737 --> 00:46:00,829
Thank you.

708
00:46:01,906 --> 00:46:04,306
And this is my birth certificate.

709
00:46:05,176 --> 00:46:08,873
And this is a picture of me
when I was in <i>The Mikado</i> in high school.

710
00:46:08,946 --> 00:46:12,006
-Oh, it's not very good, anyway.
-No, let me see it.

711
00:46:13,884 --> 00:46:15,818
-You were chubbier then.
-Yeah.

712
00:46:16,987 --> 00:46:21,651
Can you feel that? Oh, I believed you.

713
00:46:22,693 --> 00:46:24,388
I always believe you.

714
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:28,796
And this is my last will and testament.

715
00:46:28,999 --> 00:46:30,728
Your last will and testament?

716
00:46:30,801 --> 00:46:35,204
And the instructions to my funeral.
My entire estate is to be divided equally...

717
00:46:35,272 --> 00:46:38,400
...among whoever are
my four closest friends when I die.

718
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:41,341
Names will be filled in later.

719
00:46:41,412 --> 00:46:44,939
-I thought you didn't like anything morbid.
-But it isn't morbid.

720
00:46:45,015 --> 00:46:46,346
That's the point.

721
00:46:47,084 --> 00:46:49,177
Funerals don't have to be morbid.

722
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:54,023
I know just how I want mine.
In a big church...

723
00:46:55,526 --> 00:46:57,790
...and I want all the pews removed...

724
00:46:57,962 --> 00:47:01,227
...and nothing but big cushions
for people to lie around on.

725
00:47:01,298 --> 00:47:03,994
And I don't want anybody dressed in black.

726
00:47:04,068 --> 00:47:07,799
They should all be in gay, bright colors
and far-out clothes.

727
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:11,766
They should all be drinking or smoking pot
or whatever they want.

728
00:47:13,677 --> 00:47:17,670
And I want Salvador Dal to paint the
walls with lots of groovy pictures.

729
00:47:19,283 --> 00:47:21,012
And I want flowers.

730
00:47:22,219 --> 00:47:23,811
Tons of flowers.

731
00:47:24,722 --> 00:47:25,950
Not funeral wreaths.

732
00:47:26,023 --> 00:47:29,117
Just tons of wild flowers
strewn everywhere.

733
00:47:29,426 --> 00:47:30,791
And butterflies.

734
00:47:31,195 --> 00:47:33,857
Yes, lots of butterflies.

735
00:47:34,431 --> 00:47:36,456
And other animals can come, too.

736
00:47:38,235 --> 00:47:40,863
I want music playing all the time.

737
00:47:42,173 --> 00:47:45,836
And I want Neil Diamond to write me
a special memoriam and sing it.

738
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:47,400
I want the Stones to sing...

739
00:47:47,478 --> 00:47:51,209
...and Simon and Garfunkel
and the Vienna Boys' Choir.

740
00:47:52,183 --> 00:47:53,172
And me.

741
00:48:28,452 --> 00:48:29,783
Definitely you.

742
00:48:30,087 --> 00:48:32,385
-What is so morbid about that?
-Nothing.

743
00:48:32,456 --> 00:48:34,720
It's like being buried at Disneyland.

744
00:48:35,659 --> 00:48:38,560
Here it is. A present for you.

745
00:48:41,899 --> 00:48:44,094
-What is it?
-What does it feel like?

746
00:48:44,168 --> 00:48:45,897
It feels like a necklace.

747
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:49,105
They're love beads.
I wore them when I was a hippie.

748
00:48:49,607 --> 00:48:51,438
And I want you to have them.

749
00:48:52,743 --> 00:48:56,076
They look groovy on you,
especially when I fix your hair.

750
00:48:56,146 --> 00:48:56,874
Come on.

751
00:49:00,317 --> 00:49:01,648
Sit right here.

752
00:49:10,928 --> 00:49:13,897
-I don't want to look too wild.
-You won't look wild at all.

753
00:49:13,964 --> 00:49:16,660
You'll look beautiful and romantic
like Lord Byron.

754
00:49:16,734 --> 00:49:19,202
-What did he look like?
-I don't know.

755
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:20,764
God, I'm hungry.

756
00:49:20,838 --> 00:49:23,398
-There are a couple of apples in the fridge.
-Good.

757
00:49:27,478 --> 00:49:30,879
There's an awful lot of lettuce,
which is not what I'm dreaming of.

758
00:49:30,948 --> 00:49:34,714
-There's only one apple.
-It's yours. I'm not hungry.

759
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:44,188
Now, relax. It won't hurt a bit.

760
00:49:45,896 --> 00:49:50,060
-When were you a hippie?
-Years ago, when I was a kid.

761
00:49:50,934 --> 00:49:53,198
I guess it was right after my marriage.

762
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:58,401
I used to hang around the Sunset Strip,
smoke pot, spit at the cops, the whole bit.

763
00:49:59,443 --> 00:50:02,241
I only did it
because everybody else was doing it.

764
00:50:02,313 --> 00:50:05,840
And then I stopped doing it
because everybody else was doing it.

765
00:50:06,083 --> 00:50:08,051
I was losing my individuality.

766
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:16,651
But the main thing, of course,
was to protest against my mother...

767
00:50:17,094 --> 00:50:18,493
...which didn't work.

768
00:50:18,562 --> 00:50:22,931
I walked in one day with long, stringy hair,
dirty sandals and freaky clothes...

769
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,490
...and she loved it.

770
00:50:24,935 --> 00:50:28,098
Then she comes in with long, stringy hair,
dirty sandals...

771
00:50:28,172 --> 00:50:29,764
...and freaky clothes.

772
00:50:30,641 --> 00:50:34,873
How do you protest against somebody
who's doing the same thing you are, right?

773
00:50:35,813 --> 00:50:41,080
So, then I went the other way
and I joined the Young Republicans.

774
00:50:42,386 --> 00:50:43,785
Another mistake.

775
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:50,884
There's no such thing
as a young republican.

776
00:50:59,203 --> 00:51:01,103
There. You look terrific.

777
00:51:01,338 --> 00:51:04,364
-It doesn't look too wild?
-No. It doesn't look wild.

778
00:51:04,608 --> 00:51:07,008
-It gives you charisma.
-Charisma?

779
00:51:07,478 --> 00:51:10,140
Pizzazz! Star quality!

780
00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:14,943
I mean, you don't even need talent
if you have charisma.

781
00:51:15,018 --> 00:51:17,316
They'll line up for blocks to see you.

782
00:51:21,825 --> 00:51:22,792
Wow.

783
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:43,546
You're beautiful.

784
00:51:45,282 --> 00:51:47,750
You're a beautiful person inside and out.

785
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,512
Well, I like you, too.

786
00:51:55,192 --> 00:51:59,026
Yesterday when I took your hand
and put it on my breast...

787
00:52:00,197 --> 00:52:01,687
...were you shocked?

788
00:52:02,332 --> 00:52:03,560
Sort of.

789
00:52:03,901 --> 00:52:05,129
So was I.

790
00:52:05,202 --> 00:52:08,035
I don't mean from the standpoint
of morals or anything.

791
00:52:08,105 --> 00:52:12,098
I was surprised to be feeling a girl's breast
when I wasn't expecting to.

792
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:16,973
I'd hate for you to think that I go around
putting men's hands on my breast.

793
00:52:17,047 --> 00:52:19,481
No, I don't think you go around doing that.

794
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:20,812
Well, I don't.

795
00:52:23,387 --> 00:52:27,687
I mean, if I want to go to bed with a guy
usually I have this little smile...

796
00:52:27,758 --> 00:52:30,022
...that lets him know I'm interested.

797
00:52:30,294 --> 00:52:32,956
Oh, yeah? Smile that smile.
I want to feel it.

798
00:52:33,764 --> 00:52:35,959
-That's it?
-No.

799
00:52:36,433 --> 00:52:39,368
I can't do it now. You're making me laugh.

800
00:52:39,636 --> 00:52:41,001
I'll do it later.

801
00:52:42,406 --> 00:52:46,502
But I did have to use a different approach
with you, didn't I?

802
00:52:48,879 --> 00:52:51,712
Anyway, I didn't want you to think
I was terrible.

803
00:52:51,882 --> 00:52:53,008
I didn't.

804
00:52:54,351 --> 00:52:55,716
I don't.

805
00:52:58,589 --> 00:53:00,784
Oh, I hate talking about sex.

806
00:53:03,727 --> 00:53:07,094
But I did want you to know
that last night you were....

807
00:53:08,131 --> 00:53:09,530
You were really....

808
00:53:10,801 --> 00:53:12,632
Like the Fourth of July?

809
00:53:12,903 --> 00:53:16,771
Yeah. Like the Fourth of July.
And like Christmas.

810
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:22,712
-Where are you going?
-I thought I'd make some coffee.

811
00:53:22,913 --> 00:53:25,108
Great. We'll have breakfast in bed.

812
00:53:59,716 --> 00:54:03,174
-Hello, Mother.
-I'm glad I found you in, Donnie.

813
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,115
Jill, this is my mother.

814
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:10,586
Your mother? Have I been here a month?

815
00:54:12,095 --> 00:54:13,926
Mother, this is Mrs. Benson.

816
00:54:16,633 --> 00:54:19,693
-How do you do?
-How do you do, Mrs. Benson?

817
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:21,699
Are you living here, too?

818
00:54:21,805 --> 00:54:23,568
No, I live next door.

819
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:28,974
I just came in for a cup of coffee yesterday.

820
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:33,511
-I had trouble zipping up my blouse.
-So I see.

821
00:54:34,217 --> 00:54:35,741
Where is your blouse?

822
00:54:36,954 --> 00:54:40,117
Now let me see,
it must be around here somewhere.

823
00:54:40,424 --> 00:54:42,016
Oh, here it is.

824
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:46,894
You see, I have this long zipper
and it's hard to do up alone.

825
00:54:47,331 --> 00:54:49,322
Here, put your things on.

826
00:54:50,067 --> 00:54:52,729
Mother, what're you doing here?
We had an agreement.

827
00:54:52,803 --> 00:54:54,395
I was in the neighborhood.

828
00:54:54,471 --> 00:54:56,871
You were at Saks,
which is halfway across town.

829
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,134
I bought you some shirts...

830
00:54:58,208 --> 00:55:01,371
...and I thought you'd have them sooner
if I brought them myself.

831
00:55:01,445 --> 00:55:03,174
I don't need any shirts.

832
00:55:03,413 --> 00:55:06,109
You bought them as an excuse
to come down here.

833
00:55:06,283 --> 00:55:07,580
Would you mind?

834
00:55:11,521 --> 00:55:12,647
Thank you.

835
00:55:13,857 --> 00:55:16,655
-And this is what you left home for?
-This is it.

836
00:55:16,927 --> 00:55:20,226
-It isn't Buckingham Palace, is it?
-No, it's the Taj Mahal.

837
00:55:20,297 --> 00:55:22,629
Is this where you eat, on the floor?

838
00:55:22,899 --> 00:55:24,867
That happens to be a beach.

839
00:55:25,235 --> 00:55:27,396
Where did this furniture come from?

840
00:55:27,704 --> 00:55:30,901
Some of it came with the apartment.
The rest from a junk shop.

841
00:55:30,974 --> 00:55:33,704
Don't tell me which is which.
Let me guess.

842
00:55:35,078 --> 00:55:37,706
What in God's name is this?

843
00:55:39,683 --> 00:55:41,674
I don't know what you're looking at.

844
00:55:41,752 --> 00:55:43,515
I can't describe it.

845
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,319
It's my apartment.

846
00:55:46,657 --> 00:55:49,956
Have you ever thought of hiring a maid,
Mrs. Benson?

847
00:55:50,427 --> 00:55:51,655
I can manage.

848
00:55:51,995 --> 00:55:56,091
I might be sloppy, but not dirty. There's
a difference between "sloppy" and "dirty."

849
00:55:56,166 --> 00:56:00,034
I'm so glad to hear that.
Has this door always been open?

850
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:04,036
No. It's always been locked.
I opened it last night.

851
00:56:05,342 --> 00:56:08,175
-What on earth is that?
-Now what are you looking at?

852
00:56:08,245 --> 00:56:10,509
-That's what I'd like to know.
-It's your bed.

853
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,810
-It's my bed.
-Isn't it terrific?

854
00:56:13,216 --> 00:56:15,116
You actually sleep up there?

855
00:56:15,352 --> 00:56:18,014
-Like a baby.
-What happens if you fall out?

856
00:56:18,221 --> 00:56:21,918
-I go to the ladder and climb up again.
-Where are your clothes?

857
00:56:22,325 --> 00:56:23,553
In the bathroom.

858
00:56:23,627 --> 00:56:26,790
-Where is the bathroom, under the bed?
-That's right.

859
00:56:41,511 --> 00:56:44,241
-Wow! Were you ever right?
-About what?

860
00:56:44,381 --> 00:56:47,544
She never had syphilis.
I'm surprised she had you.

861
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:50,513
How come you introduced me
as Mrs. Benson?

862
00:56:50,587 --> 00:56:52,680
It made you sound more important.

863
00:56:57,227 --> 00:56:59,320
-What's she doing?
-Testing the plumbing.

864
00:56:59,396 --> 00:57:01,227
She's a nut about plumbing.

865
00:57:05,335 --> 00:57:06,802
How'd you know it was her?

866
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:08,895
When she came in
she didn't make a sound.

867
00:57:08,972 --> 00:57:12,203
Smell. It's called Numero Dix.
She uses half a bottle at a time.

868
00:57:12,275 --> 00:57:14,470
And I always know when she's around.

869
00:57:15,879 --> 00:57:17,574
It's like having a bell on a cat.

870
00:57:23,887 --> 00:57:25,377
Now what's she doing?

871
00:57:26,423 --> 00:57:29,483
Checking to see
if I've got enough socks and underwear.

872
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:34,023
She is gathering evidence to hit me with
and try to make me come home.

873
00:57:34,097 --> 00:57:37,692
She's changed her tactics, though.
She should have walked in and said:

874
00:57:37,768 --> 00:57:39,497
"I could absolutely cry."

875
00:57:39,569 --> 00:57:41,833
-She'll say it.
-No. I know all her routines.

876
00:57:41,905 --> 00:57:45,341
She'll say it. I'll make you a bet.
How about dinner tonight?

877
00:57:45,442 --> 00:57:49,344
Now, if she doesn't say it, then I lose
and we eat in my place and I pay.

878
00:57:49,412 --> 00:57:51,710
But if she says it, we eat here and you pay.

879
00:57:51,782 --> 00:57:53,841
-Okay.
-Here she comes.

880
00:57:58,388 --> 00:58:01,949
Well, that's some bathroom.

881
00:58:02,025 --> 00:58:05,620
-No wonder you hide it under the bed.
-I thought you'd say something else.

882
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,822
I haven't finished. I haven't even started.

883
00:58:07,898 --> 00:58:11,197
-Say it and get it over with.
-There's only one thing to say.

884
00:58:11,268 --> 00:58:14,396
Perhaps it's a blessing
that you can't see what you're living in.

885
00:58:14,471 --> 00:58:17,372
Mother, I count that blessing
every time I walk in the door.

886
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,340
Donnie, can I be honest?

887
00:58:19,743 --> 00:58:21,267
-Can you?
-This is it.

888
00:58:21,578 --> 00:58:23,603
I am shocked and appalled.

889
00:58:24,247 --> 00:58:25,544
Oh, I Iose.

890
00:58:25,849 --> 00:58:27,476
-7:30, okay?
-Perfect.

891
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:29,978
There's no tub in your bathroom.

892
00:58:30,287 --> 00:58:32,118
It's under the dining table.

893
00:58:38,728 --> 00:58:40,662
I could absolutely cry.

894
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:43,130
You win! Are hamburgers all right?

895
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,929
Yeah. But at least two each.

896
00:58:45,001 --> 00:58:48,493
I'm not talking about this rat hole, Donnie.
I'm talking about you, too.

897
00:58:48,572 --> 00:58:50,631
Look at you. What's that on your head?

898
00:58:50,707 --> 00:58:53,141
-French Foreign Legion cap.
-Have you enlisted?

899
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:54,700
No, I was drafted.

900
00:58:54,911 --> 00:58:57,709
I'm not just talking about that.
You have lost weight.

901
00:58:57,781 --> 00:59:00,409
I haven't.
I'm the perfect weight for my height.

902
00:59:00,483 --> 00:59:05,318
-6'1" and my age, 11.
-I'd just like to see what you're eating.

903
00:59:08,191 --> 00:59:11,683
Why, there's nothing in here
but lettuce and an apple.

904
00:59:12,429 --> 00:59:13,453
Where?

905
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:15,195
Behind the lettuce.

906
00:59:15,265 --> 00:59:17,367
-See, I knew there was another one.
-Tell me, where is Mr. Benson?

907
00:59:17,367 --> 00:59:19,164
-See, I knew there was another one.
-Tell me, where is Mr. Benson?

908
00:59:19,803 --> 00:59:22,829
-Who's Mr. Benson?
-I assumed he was your husband.

909
00:59:24,174 --> 00:59:26,870
Oh, you mean Jack. I don't know.

910
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:30,739
The last I saw him, he was outside
of the Hamburger Hamlet on the Strip.

911
00:59:30,814 --> 00:59:34,341
-Why?
-I was curious about your marital status.

912
00:59:35,752 --> 00:59:38,277
-I haven't any.
-Jill's divorced, Mother.

913
00:59:38,688 --> 00:59:40,952
Well, how old are you, Mrs. Benson?

914
00:59:42,392 --> 00:59:43,416
Nineteen.

915
00:59:43,894 --> 00:59:45,156
Nineteen?

916
00:59:45,228 --> 00:59:48,163
And you've already been married
and divorced?

917
00:59:48,498 --> 00:59:49,396
Yeah.

918
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:51,528
How long were you married?

919
00:59:52,469 --> 00:59:53,527
Six days.

920
00:59:54,104 --> 00:59:56,368
And on the seventh day, you rested?

921
00:59:57,674 --> 00:59:58,800
No, I split.

922
00:59:59,643 --> 01:00:01,873
I got to change now. I have an audition.

923
01:00:01,945 --> 01:00:05,972
-Audition for what?
-A play. At the Cosmic Workshop.

924
01:00:06,216 --> 01:00:08,309
I was speaking to Mrs. Benson.

925
01:00:08,585 --> 01:00:10,985
A play. At the Cosmic Workshop.

926
01:00:12,889 --> 01:00:14,516
Then, you're an actress.

927
01:00:14,758 --> 01:00:15,850
Well, yeah.

928
01:00:15,926 --> 01:00:19,089
Might I have seen you in anything
besides your underwear?

929
01:00:21,431 --> 01:00:23,991
Not unless you went
to BeverIy Hills High School.

930
01:00:24,067 --> 01:00:25,932
I was in <i>The Mikado</i>.

931
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:28,528
I played Yum-Yum.

932
01:00:29,472 --> 01:00:31,497
I'm sure you did.

933
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:36,105
Does your mother know where you are?

934
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:38,010
Sure.

935
01:00:38,081 --> 01:00:40,709
And does she approve
of the way you're living?

936
01:00:42,252 --> 01:00:43,879
What way am I living?

937
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:46,545
Mother, are you conducting
some kind of survey?

938
01:00:46,623 --> 01:00:48,818
You're asking for it, Donnie.

939
01:00:49,526 --> 01:00:52,552
I'm sure Mrs. Benson doesn't mind
answering a few questions.

940
01:00:52,629 --> 01:00:54,859
-Do you, Mrs. Benson?
-I have this audition.

941
01:00:54,931 --> 01:00:56,922
What does your father do?

942
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,862
-Which one?
-How many fathers have you?

943
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:02,730
Four. One real and three steps.

944
01:01:02,939 --> 01:01:05,567
Your mother has been married four times?

945
01:01:06,376 --> 01:01:09,072
So far. We live in Los Angeles.

946
01:01:10,313 --> 01:01:12,907
Then you come from a broken home.

947
01:01:13,416 --> 01:01:14,576
Several.

948
01:01:14,818 --> 01:01:17,343
Why does your mother marry so often?

949
01:01:19,589 --> 01:01:21,887
I don't know. I guess she likes it.

950
01:01:22,892 --> 01:01:26,953
I mean, she likes getting married.
Obviously, she doesn't like being married.

951
01:01:27,364 --> 01:01:29,832
Now, I think I'd better get started, okay?

952
01:01:33,436 --> 01:01:34,266
Ciao!

953
01:01:34,337 --> 01:01:38,296
-Don't forget: 7:30, here.
-What happens at 7:30 here?

954
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:41,310
Jill and I are having dinner together.

955
01:01:41,411 --> 01:01:44,380
-Just the two of us, alone.
-Mrs. Benson?

956
01:01:46,149 --> 01:01:48,640
-I think you've forgotten something.
-What is it?

957
01:01:48,718 --> 01:01:50,208
Susan Potter's hair.

958
01:01:51,554 --> 01:01:54,318
-I'm closing the door.
-I don't blame you.

959
01:01:56,026 --> 01:01:59,894
-Did you have to be so goddamn rude?
-Was I rude?

960
01:02:00,463 --> 01:02:02,090
All those questions.

961
01:02:02,198 --> 01:02:04,462
Are you the attorney general
of Hillsborough?

962
01:02:04,534 --> 01:02:08,129
I think I have a right to know something
about my son's friends.

963
01:02:08,805 --> 01:02:10,670
Rights? Let's talk about my rights.

964
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:13,072
You're not supposed to be here
for another month.

965
01:02:13,143 --> 01:02:14,474
Why'd you come today?

966
01:02:14,544 --> 01:02:16,978
Since when do you speak to me like this?

967
01:02:17,047 --> 01:02:19,311
Since when do you sneak into my room?

968
01:02:19,382 --> 01:02:22,408
-I didn't. The door was unlocked.
-You could have knocked.

969
01:02:22,485 --> 01:02:24,783
-I thought it was a raid.
-It should've been.

970
01:02:24,854 --> 01:02:28,221
-Why don't you lock your door?
-Because until I knew my way around...

971
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:30,350
...it was easier to let people come in.

972
01:02:30,427 --> 01:02:33,487
But I assure you,
it will be locked from now on.

973
01:02:34,998 --> 01:02:39,128
Well, I thought my coming here today
was going to be a nice surprise for you.

974
01:02:39,202 --> 01:02:42,069
-If I knew I'd be treated like this--
-You'd have come anyway.

975
01:02:42,138 --> 01:02:45,437
I'm glad I did.
My worst fears have been realized.

976
01:02:45,508 --> 01:02:47,032
Thank heaven for that.

977
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:50,409
My worst fear was that
your worst fears wouldn't be realized.

978
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:54,473
Imagine if you came in here and liked it?
We'd have nothing to talk about.

979
01:02:54,551 --> 01:02:57,452
Did you have to choose
such a sordid neighborhood?

980
01:02:57,787 --> 01:02:59,914
To me, it looks just like Hillsborough.

981
01:02:59,989 --> 01:03:03,152
I'd be terrified to live
with the type of people around here.

982
01:03:03,226 --> 01:03:05,922
-They've been nice to me.
-I'll bet they have.

983
01:03:06,196 --> 01:03:09,632
Yesterday you told me
you didn't even know Mrs. Benson's name.

984
01:03:09,966 --> 01:03:11,558
That was yesterday.

985
01:03:12,735 --> 01:03:15,636
Well, you certainly became friends
in a hurry, didn't you?

986
01:03:15,705 --> 01:03:18,868
-She's a very friendly girl.
-Yes, I can see she is.

987
01:03:19,209 --> 01:03:21,575
-May I ask you a personal question?
-No.

988
01:03:21,744 --> 01:03:25,475
-Have you slept with this girl?
-I thought you'd never ask.

989
01:03:26,349 --> 01:03:27,611
Yes, I have.

990
01:03:28,685 --> 01:03:31,779
-As if I didn't know.
-If you know, why do you ask?

991
01:03:31,855 --> 01:03:34,790
Now I know why you were so anxious
to have your own place.

992
01:03:34,858 --> 01:03:36,052
I know you, Donnie.

993
01:03:36,126 --> 01:03:38,287
You've got that Linda Fletcher look again.

994
01:03:38,361 --> 01:03:41,091
-You'll fall in love with this girl, too.
-And if I do?

995
01:03:41,164 --> 01:03:43,029
Does it bother you I'm heterosexual?

996
01:03:43,099 --> 01:03:46,364
Mrs. Benson is not exactly the girl
a mother dreams of for her son.

997
01:03:46,436 --> 01:03:48,802
I'm not interested
in the girl of your dreams.

998
01:03:48,872 --> 01:03:52,467
She's got beady little eyes like a bird
and a figure like a flagpole.

999
01:03:52,542 --> 01:03:54,339
You've described the girl of my dreams.

1000
01:03:54,444 --> 01:03:57,880
You can't see the difference
between good and bad. I can.

1001
01:03:57,947 --> 01:04:00,438
I can look into people's faces and eyes.
You can't.

1002
01:04:00,517 --> 01:04:02,849
I can see past their eyes, into their souls.

1003
01:04:02,919 --> 01:04:06,150
Leave us not forget Little Donnie Dark
and all that vision.

1004
01:04:06,222 --> 01:04:10,090
-I wish you did have some of that vision.
-I'm sure you do, Mother.

1005
01:04:10,927 --> 01:04:14,328
Deep down haven't you always been
ashamed you produced a blind child?

1006
01:04:14,397 --> 01:04:17,423
-There's nothing to be ashamed of.
-Embarrassed, then?

1007
01:04:18,168 --> 01:04:21,296
You have never given me reason
to be embarrassed by you.

1008
01:04:26,609 --> 01:04:27,974
Come on in.

1009
01:04:29,846 --> 01:04:31,541
I hate to bother you.

1010
01:04:31,748 --> 01:04:32,942
What is it?

1011
01:04:33,249 --> 01:04:34,739
Just another zipper.

1012
01:04:38,087 --> 01:04:40,453
Hang in there. I think you're winning.

1013
01:04:41,457 --> 01:04:43,118
Thank you so much.

1014
01:04:47,497 --> 01:04:50,159
She'll be a big help to you.
She can't even dress herself.

1015
01:04:50,233 --> 01:04:53,498
-That's where I can help her.
-I have a wonderful idea:

1016
01:04:54,003 --> 01:04:57,564
You come home, I'll have your bed raised.
There's a ladder in the garage.

1017
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,972
Nice try, Mother.
It just wouldn't be the same.

1018
01:05:00,043 --> 01:05:04,844
All right, if you insist on staying here,
I will not support you.

1019
01:05:06,482 --> 01:05:08,780
-What're you doing?
-Calling the <i>Chronicle</i>.

1020
01:05:08,851 --> 01:05:10,978
Florence Baker refuses
to help the handicapped.

1021
01:05:11,054 --> 01:05:14,512
-I'm serious, Donnie.
-Then I'll call <i>The New York Times</i>.

1022
01:05:14,757 --> 01:05:18,750
What are you going to do for money?
The little you saved must be gone now.

1023
01:05:19,896 --> 01:05:22,592
I can always walk along the streets
with a tin cup.

1024
01:05:22,665 --> 01:05:25,930
-Now you're embarrassing me.
-No, I'll keep away from Saks.

1025
01:05:26,836 --> 01:05:30,932
You just stop all this joking
and tell me what your plans are.

1026
01:05:31,007 --> 01:05:35,467
I plan to sing and play the guitar.
I'm pretty good. You said so yourself.

1027
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,044
I had no idea you were planning
to make a career of it.

1028
01:05:40,116 --> 01:05:42,448
Have you any idea
of the competition you're facing?

1029
01:05:42,518 --> 01:05:45,043
I have just as good a chance
as anybody else.

1030
01:05:45,121 --> 01:05:46,952
Better. I have charisma.

1031
01:05:48,057 --> 01:05:51,288
May I ask how you arrived
at this brilliant decision?

1032
01:05:51,661 --> 01:05:55,119
It's elementary, my dear Mother,
by the simple process of elimination.

1033
01:05:55,198 --> 01:05:59,897
I made a long list of all the things
I couldn't do, like commercial airline pilot.

1034
01:05:59,969 --> 01:06:03,735
I doubt that TWA would be too pleased
of having me flying their planes...

1035
01:06:03,806 --> 01:06:05,603
...nor United or Pan Am.

1036
01:06:05,908 --> 01:06:07,136
Photographer?

1037
01:06:07,277 --> 01:06:10,474
A definite out,
along with ball player and cab driver.

1038
01:06:11,247 --> 01:06:12,236
Matador?

1039
01:06:12,815 --> 01:06:14,942
Didn't strike me as too promising.

1040
01:06:15,351 --> 01:06:16,579
Honestly.

1041
01:06:16,919 --> 01:06:18,682
I considered becoming an eye doctor...

1042
01:06:18,755 --> 01:06:22,282
...but that would just be a case
of the blind leading the blind.

1043
01:06:22,825 --> 01:06:24,816
That was a little joke, Mother.

1044
01:06:26,229 --> 01:06:27,753
I said it was little.

1045
01:06:28,131 --> 01:06:31,726
I suppose Linda Fletcher
put this guitar idea into your head.

1046
01:06:32,835 --> 01:06:34,996
You might say she was instrumental.

1047
01:06:35,505 --> 01:06:37,803
-Oh, boy!
-That was another joke.

1048
01:06:37,874 --> 01:06:42,334
You got to start laughing at something.
People are going to think you're a lesbian.

1049
01:06:45,081 --> 01:06:48,573
You certainly have picked up
some colorful language, haven't you?

1050
01:06:48,651 --> 01:06:51,279
-You learn everything down here.
-Yes. Well, I think, young man...

1051
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:56,381
...you have learned just about enough.

1052
01:06:56,959 --> 01:06:59,189
I hardly recognize my own son.

1053
01:06:59,262 --> 01:07:01,856
-What are you doing?
-What I should've done long ago.

1054
01:07:01,931 --> 01:07:04,798
-I'm taking you home.
-Forget it, Mother. There's no way.

1055
01:07:04,867 --> 01:07:08,394
-You cannot stay down here alone.
-I'm not alone. I have friends.

1056
01:07:08,471 --> 01:07:12,601
You haven't fooled me with these parties.
There are no parties. You have no friends.

1057
01:07:12,675 --> 01:07:17,738
-I have now. I have Mrs. Benson.
-You'd be better off with a Seeing Eye dog.

1058
01:07:17,847 --> 01:07:20,509
Not as much fun.
Besides, I got a Seeing Eye mother.

1059
01:07:20,583 --> 01:07:22,915
That's right and she's taking you home.

1060
01:07:22,985 --> 01:07:25,385
Mrs. Benson'll have to learn
how to dress herself.

1061
01:07:25,455 --> 01:07:28,015
-Put the suitcase away.
-You're coming home with me.

1062
01:07:28,091 --> 01:07:29,956
Give me that suitcase.

1063
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:33,054
Where is it? Give it to me.

1064
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:38,962
Give it to me.

1065
01:08:05,762 --> 01:08:09,721
Mom, now please stop worrying about me.

1066
01:08:10,133 --> 01:08:11,327
I'll be all right.

1067
01:08:11,401 --> 01:08:14,962
If the music doesn't work out,
I can always study law or technology.

1068
01:08:15,037 --> 01:08:17,801
There are lots of things
blind people can do today.

1069
01:08:17,874 --> 01:08:19,774
Now please, stop worrying.

1070
01:08:27,049 --> 01:08:30,018
Well, I got to go. Thanks for dropping by.

1071
01:08:30,253 --> 01:08:32,244
-Where are you going?
-Shopping.

1072
01:08:32,321 --> 01:08:35,586
I told you, I'm having dinner in tonight,
with Mrs. Benson.

1073
01:08:36,025 --> 01:08:38,391
Just the two of us alone.

1074
01:08:39,228 --> 01:08:42,891
-Well, I'll just wait here until you get back.
-I don't want you to wait.

1075
01:08:42,965 --> 01:08:45,798
Have a nice trip home,
and I'll call you tomorrow.

1076
01:08:46,002 --> 01:08:49,267
Now, please, I don't want
to smell you here when I get back.

1077
01:08:50,106 --> 01:08:52,631
And after dinner, I suppose an orgy.

1078
01:08:53,042 --> 01:08:54,304
I hope so.

1079
01:08:55,144 --> 01:08:59,979
At last the sinister truth is revealed:
Little Donnie Dark is just a dirty old man!

1080
01:09:18,367 --> 01:09:20,267
Mrs. Benson.

1081
01:09:22,071 --> 01:09:23,060
Yes?

1082
01:09:24,707 --> 01:09:28,507
Mrs. Benson, might I speak to you
for a moment, please?

1083
01:09:28,744 --> 01:09:32,043
I have an audition and
I should be leaving soon.

1084
01:09:32,114 --> 01:09:34,241
I don't know this town. I always get lost.

1085
01:09:34,317 --> 01:09:36,649
Don't worry,
I'll see that you get off in time.

1086
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:40,155
Please, come in, sit down.
I thought we might have a little chat.

1087
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:44,057
Just girls, together.
Can I get you coffee, tea?

1088
01:09:44,327 --> 01:09:46,955
No, thank you.
But if that apple is still there.

1089
01:09:47,029 --> 01:09:48,553
I'm sure it is.

1090
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,464
-Where's Don?
-Shopping.

1091
01:09:54,103 --> 01:09:58,506
You must be so careful to wash fruits
and vegetables today, you know.

1092
01:09:59,175 --> 01:10:02,201
They spray those insecticides
all over everything.

1093
01:10:02,278 --> 01:10:05,509
I'm not sure that
the bugs aren't less harmful.

1094
01:10:06,315 --> 01:10:08,806
I like apples to be nice and shiny.

1095
01:10:12,688 --> 01:10:14,849
This reminds me of something.
What is it?

1096
01:10:14,924 --> 01:10:16,221
I have no idea.

1097
01:10:18,127 --> 01:10:22,325
You handing me the apple, nice and shiny.

1098
01:10:23,533 --> 01:10:25,330
I know. Snow White.

1099
01:10:25,568 --> 01:10:28,628
Remember when the witch brought her
the poisoned apple?

1100
01:10:29,338 --> 01:10:32,307
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.

1101
01:10:32,675 --> 01:10:34,404
I know you're not a witch.

1102
01:10:34,944 --> 01:10:39,745
Of course not.
And I know you're not Snow White.

1103
01:10:41,817 --> 01:10:43,284
Yes, well.

1104
01:10:44,153 --> 01:10:48,783
I certainly have enjoyed our talk,
and I wish I could stay longer...

1105
01:10:48,858 --> 01:10:50,382
...but I do have my audition.

1106
01:10:50,459 --> 01:10:54,759
Listen, my car is right downstairs.
I'll drop you and we can talk on the way.

1107
01:10:54,997 --> 01:10:59,058
You're too kind, Mrs. Baker.
I wouldn't dream of imposing.

1108
01:10:59,135 --> 01:11:01,933
You're not imposing.
I'm free the whole afternoon.

1109
01:11:02,004 --> 01:11:04,598
No, thanks anyway.
I have to have my lunch first.

1110
01:11:04,674 --> 01:11:06,505
I'd love to take you to lunch.

1111
01:11:06,576 --> 01:11:10,239
I know the most wonderfuI restaurant.
They have the best food.

1112
01:11:10,313 --> 01:11:12,781
-No, thanks.
-Do you like lasagna?

1113
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:15,247
Is the sky blue?

1114
01:11:15,318 --> 01:11:17,878
They make a lasagna
with eight different cheeses...

1115
01:11:17,954 --> 01:11:20,149
...and the sauce is a state secret.

1116
01:11:23,492 --> 01:11:26,359
How do you manage to keep your figure,
Mrs. Benson?

1117
01:11:26,696 --> 01:11:29,187
I wish you'd stop calling me, Mrs. Benson.

1118
01:11:29,432 --> 01:11:31,900
That is your name, isn't it, Mrs. Benson?

1119
01:11:32,335 --> 01:11:34,860
But you don't say it as though you mean it.

1120
01:11:35,137 --> 01:11:38,368
I'm sorry. Suppose I call you, Jill.

1121
01:11:38,708 --> 01:11:41,734
That's more friendly.
I'll try to say it as though I mean it.

1122
01:11:41,811 --> 01:11:46,248
Now, Jill, you were telling me
about your childhood.

1123
01:11:47,316 --> 01:11:48,340
I was?

1124
01:11:48,651 --> 01:11:51,779
It must have been interesting,
having so many fathers.

1125
01:11:51,921 --> 01:11:55,015
Well, yes, actually, it was.

1126
01:11:56,092 --> 01:11:58,754
But why don't you get to the point,
Mrs. Baker?

1127
01:11:59,929 --> 01:12:01,658
I know what it is anyway.

1128
01:12:01,731 --> 01:12:02,755
You do?

1129
01:12:03,633 --> 01:12:07,330
Well, I know you didn't ask me
to lunch to discuss my childhood...

1130
01:12:07,703 --> 01:12:09,796
...or to tell me how pretty I am.

1131
01:12:10,306 --> 01:12:11,705
I was interested to see...

1132
01:12:11,774 --> 01:12:14,208
...what you and Donnie
might have in common.

1133
01:12:14,276 --> 01:12:15,868
He likes you very much.

1134
01:12:16,512 --> 01:12:18,412
I like him very much.

1135
01:12:19,081 --> 01:12:22,209
He might even be
the most beautiful person I ever met.

1136
01:12:23,252 --> 01:12:26,278
Just imagine going through life
never seeing anything.

1137
01:12:26,422 --> 01:12:30,791
Not a flower, or a painting,
or even a Christmas card.

1138
01:12:32,495 --> 01:12:36,192
Wow! I want to die, but he wants to live.

1139
01:12:36,599 --> 01:12:38,123
I mean really live.

1140
01:12:39,035 --> 01:12:42,436
He can even kid about it.
Wow, he's fantastic.

1141
01:12:42,672 --> 01:12:45,698
Then you would want what's best for him,
wouldn't you?

1142
01:12:45,808 --> 01:12:49,801
Now we're getting to it.
I knew this lunch wasn't free.

1143
01:12:50,146 --> 01:12:54,139
Maybe I should ask him to leave
the apartment and go home with you?

1144
01:12:54,417 --> 01:12:56,476
He was happy at home
till Linda Fletcher...

1145
01:12:56,552 --> 01:12:59,385
...filled him with ideas
about a place of his own.

1146
01:12:59,889 --> 01:13:03,552
Well, I think that you believe
that he can only be happy with you.

1147
01:13:04,193 --> 01:13:07,720
Well, there are none so blind
as those who will not see.

1148
01:13:08,097 --> 01:13:11,794
There! I can quote Dylan Thomas
and Little Donnie Dark.

1149
01:13:12,501 --> 01:13:14,594
You constantly astonish me.

1150
01:13:15,137 --> 01:13:17,662
Well, we women of the world do that.

1151
01:13:18,574 --> 01:13:23,273
It's funny how like Linda you are.
Donnie's certainly consistent with his girls.

1152
01:13:24,747 --> 01:13:28,706
-Oh, my goodness, it's after 3:00.
-I'll get the check. Waiter.

1153
01:13:28,984 --> 01:13:30,508
Waiter, please.

1154
01:13:33,055 --> 01:13:36,422
I hope you won't tell Donnie
that we had lunch together.

1155
01:13:36,659 --> 01:13:39,093
Okay, but if he asks, I won't lie.

1156
01:13:39,695 --> 01:13:40,923
He won't ask.

1157
01:13:41,964 --> 01:13:44,933
-Why do you call him, Donnie?
-Well, that's his name.

1158
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,401
-Don't I say it as though I mean it?
-He hates being called, Donnie.

1159
01:13:48,471 --> 01:13:52,567
-He's never mentioned it.
-Of course he has. You just don't listen.

1160
01:13:53,275 --> 01:13:56,301
There are none so deaf as those
who will not hear.

1161
01:13:57,012 --> 01:13:59,412
You could make up a lot of those,
couldn't you?

1162
01:13:59,482 --> 01:14:02,315
There are none so lame
as those who will not walk.

1163
01:14:03,385 --> 01:14:06,548
There are none so thin
as those who will not eat.

1164
01:14:07,423 --> 01:14:10,586
Do you really honestly think that
it's a good idea for Donnie...

1165
01:14:10,659 --> 01:14:12,217
...to live there alone?

1166
01:14:12,294 --> 01:14:16,492
Yes, I really honestly feel
it's a good idea for Don...

1167
01:14:16,565 --> 01:14:18,590
...to live wherever he wants to.

1168
01:14:19,235 --> 01:14:21,760
Anyway, he's not alone.
I'm right next door.

1169
01:14:22,538 --> 01:14:25,098
For how long?
Do you have a lease on that apartment?

1170
01:14:25,174 --> 01:14:26,198
No.

1171
01:14:27,176 --> 01:14:29,804
Then you could move out tomorrow
if you wanted to.

1172
01:14:29,879 --> 01:14:31,107
That's right.

1173
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,477
You couldn't sustain a marriage
for more than six days, could you?

1174
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:36,575
My marriage doesn't concern you.

1175
01:14:36,919 --> 01:14:39,410
It didn't concern you much either, did it?

1176
01:14:40,689 --> 01:14:42,714
As a matter of fact, it did.

1177
01:14:42,892 --> 01:14:46,760
Have you thought about what marriage
to a blind boy might be like?

1178
01:14:46,929 --> 01:14:49,523
Even your mother has not covered
that territory.

1179
01:14:49,598 --> 01:14:51,691
Just leave my mother out of this.

1180
01:15:00,176 --> 01:15:01,268
I'm sorry.

1181
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:03,901
I didn't know
you were so touchy about her.

1182
01:15:04,013 --> 01:15:06,846
I'm not touchy about her.
I don't want to talk about her.

1183
01:15:06,916 --> 01:15:09,384
All right, we won't. We'll talk about you.

1184
01:15:09,451 --> 01:15:13,512
You've seen Donnie at his best
in that place that he's memorized.

1185
01:15:13,589 --> 01:15:17,286
He's memorized how many steps
to the drugstore, to the delicatessen.

1186
01:15:17,927 --> 01:15:20,327
And you were probably
very impressed by that.

1187
01:15:20,396 --> 01:15:23,729
I've seen him in strange surroundings.
He didn't know I was watching.

1188
01:15:23,799 --> 01:15:26,529
I've seen him lost. I've seen him panic.

1189
01:15:26,669 --> 01:15:30,070
He needs someone who'll stay with him
and not just for six days.

1190
01:15:30,172 --> 01:15:31,799
Stop worrying, Mrs. Baker.

1191
01:15:31,874 --> 01:15:34,968
Nothing serious will develop
between Don and me.

1192
01:15:35,644 --> 01:15:38,135
-I'm not built that way.
-Donnie is built that way.

1193
01:15:38,214 --> 01:15:40,774
Oh, please. We're just having kicks.

1194
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:42,374
Kicks!

1195
01:15:42,685 --> 01:15:44,880
That's how it started with Linda Fletcher.

1196
01:15:44,954 --> 01:15:47,320
Donnie fell in love with her.
He will with you, too.

1197
01:15:47,389 --> 01:15:49,482
-Then what happens?
-I don't know.

1198
01:15:49,558 --> 01:15:53,050
Well, I do know.
Stop it now before you hurt him.

1199
01:15:53,128 --> 01:15:55,858
What about you? Aren't you hurting him?

1200
01:15:56,065 --> 01:15:58,829
I can't. I can only irritate him.
You can hurt him.

1201
01:15:58,901 --> 01:16:01,768
The longer you stay with him,
the harder it will be when....

1202
01:16:01,837 --> 01:16:04,169
Listen to me,
let him come home with me.

1203
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:06,970
Have kicks with someone
who won't feel them when you leave.

1204
01:16:07,042 --> 01:16:10,705
I'm not so sure you can't hurt him.
Maybe more than anybody.

1205
01:16:10,913 --> 01:16:14,849
I think you deserve all the credit you
can get for raising a marvelous guy.

1206
01:16:14,917 --> 01:16:18,444
But bringing up a son, even a blind one,
is not a lifetime occupation.

1207
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:19,953
You don't know anything.

1208
01:16:20,022 --> 01:16:22,582
The more you help him,
the more you hurt him.

1209
01:16:22,658 --> 01:16:26,253
It was Linda Fletcher, not you,
who gave him what he needed most...

1210
01:16:26,328 --> 01:16:28,057
...confidence in himself.

1211
01:16:30,032 --> 01:16:31,966
You're always dwelling on the negative...

1212
01:16:32,034 --> 01:16:34,093
...always what he needs,
never what he wants...

1213
01:16:34,169 --> 01:16:36,569
...always what he can't do,
never what he can.

1214
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:39,506
What about his music?
Have you heard the songs he wrote?

1215
01:16:39,575 --> 01:16:41,907
I'll bet you didn't even know
he writes songs.

1216
01:16:41,977 --> 01:16:44,070
You might be dead right about me.

1217
01:16:44,146 --> 01:16:47,604
I'm not the ideal girl for Don,
but I know one thing...

1218
01:16:47,683 --> 01:16:48,911
...neither are you!

1219
01:16:48,984 --> 01:16:51,282
And if I'm going to tell anybody
to go home...

1220
01:16:51,353 --> 01:16:54,481
...it's going to be you, Mrs. Baker!
You, go home!

1221
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,190
What are you doing?

1222
01:17:32,261 --> 01:17:35,389
I'm looking for some wax paper
to wrap this meat in.

1223
01:17:35,464 --> 01:17:38,592
-There is no wax paper, Mother.
-The meat looks terrible.

1224
01:17:38,901 --> 01:17:41,927
-Nobody asked you to look at it.
-What time is it?

1225
01:17:47,009 --> 01:17:48,499
Twenty of ten.

1226
01:17:48,944 --> 01:17:50,206
Twenty of ten?

1227
01:17:50,279 --> 01:17:53,339
I know. She is unreliable
and undependable. What else is new?

1228
01:17:53,415 --> 01:17:56,578
You did say 7:30. I heard you.

1229
01:17:57,987 --> 01:18:01,514
Why don't you change your shirt?
Put on one of the new ones I bought you.

1230
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:03,285
Because I like this one.

1231
01:18:03,559 --> 01:18:08,292
-You don't have to hang around, you know.
-I'll just wait here until she gets back.

1232
01:18:08,364 --> 01:18:10,992
I won't interfere with your orgy.
I told you that.

1233
01:18:11,066 --> 01:18:12,829
No, I told you that.

1234
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:17,261
<i>"I knew the day you met me</i>

1235
01:18:18,107 --> 01:18:21,076
<i>"I could love you if you let me</i>

1236
01:18:21,977 --> 01:18:24,775
<i>"Though you touched my cheek and</i>

1237
01:18:24,947 --> 01:18:28,644
<i>"Said how easy you'd forget me</i>

1238
01:18:29,218 --> 01:18:35,350
<i>"You said, butterflies are free"</i>

1239
01:18:36,191 --> 01:18:37,988
Please, turn that off, Mom.

1240
01:18:38,427 --> 01:18:40,224
Is that the song you wrote?

1241
01:18:40,362 --> 01:18:42,193
Yeah. How'd you know I wrote that?

1242
01:18:43,632 --> 01:18:45,463
I didn't. I just asked you.

1243
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:49,369
It's good. Pretty.

1244
01:18:49,438 --> 01:18:50,700
<i>"On that velvet"</i>

1245
01:18:50,773 --> 01:18:52,502
You mean it's pretty good.

1246
01:18:52,674 --> 01:18:56,940
No. I mean good and pretty.

1247
01:18:57,012 --> 01:18:58,240
Oh, wow!

1248
01:18:59,281 --> 01:19:01,841
Where do you suppose she is?

1249
01:19:02,351 --> 01:19:06,845
-She's probably still auditioning.
-For eight hours? I'm worried about her.

1250
01:19:06,922 --> 01:19:09,755
-You're worried about Jill?
-Aren't you?

1251
01:19:11,593 --> 01:19:13,185
Something's come over you.

1252
01:19:13,262 --> 01:19:15,787
You like my song,
now you're worried about Jill.

1253
01:19:15,864 --> 01:19:17,889
You haven't mentioned
my coming home for hours.

1254
01:19:17,966 --> 01:19:20,491
-Are you all right?
-Don't I seem all right?

1255
01:19:20,636 --> 01:19:24,163
No. You're not behaving like Super Mom.

1256
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:28,676
-Then you'll be telling me you like Jill.
-I don't dislike her.

1257
01:19:28,744 --> 01:19:31,577
I just wish that she were
a different sort of girl.

1258
01:19:31,647 --> 01:19:34,480
She's a different girl.
That's what you don't like.

1259
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:37,246
When I was her age,
punctuality meant something.

1260
01:19:37,486 --> 01:19:38,475
What did it mean?

1261
01:19:38,554 --> 01:19:42,320
If I were going to be three hours late
for dinner, I'd call and explain.

1262
01:19:42,391 --> 01:19:43,949
You'd never be three hours late.

1263
01:19:44,026 --> 01:19:47,052
-No, I certainly would not.
-You'd be a month early.

1264
01:19:49,031 --> 01:19:50,623
Maybe she's lost.

1265
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:53,495
She said she always loses her way
around San Francisco.

1266
01:19:53,569 --> 01:19:55,696
Any cab driver can bring her home.

1267
01:19:56,538 --> 01:19:59,507
-She never said she loses her way around.
-She said it to me.

1268
01:19:59,575 --> 01:20:01,941
If she said it to you, I'd have heard it.

1269
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:04,410
Well, I guess it was after you went out.

1270
01:20:04,646 --> 01:20:07,171
-Was she here while I was out?
-It seems to me she was.

1271
01:20:07,249 --> 01:20:07,908
Why?

1272
01:20:07,983 --> 01:20:10,315
The usual, she wanted her dress zipped up.

1273
01:20:10,385 --> 01:20:13,320
-You did that while I was here, Mother.
-She dropped by.

1274
01:20:13,388 --> 01:20:15,754
-She was here for a minute.
-What'd you talk about?

1275
01:20:15,824 --> 01:20:18,952
-I don't remember.
-You remember she loses her way.

1276
01:20:19,027 --> 01:20:21,222
-What else?
-What does it matter?

1277
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:24,629
-If it doesn't matter, then tell me!
-Donnie, please don't shout at me.

1278
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:26,793
We talked about Snow White.

1279
01:20:28,504 --> 01:20:29,869
Snow White?

1280
01:20:30,506 --> 01:20:32,997
And the Seven Dwarfs? That Snow White?

1281
01:20:33,075 --> 01:20:34,542
Is there any other?

1282
01:20:34,843 --> 01:20:36,606
Why were you talking about her?

1283
01:20:36,678 --> 01:20:39,511
What's the difference
if we were talking about Snow White?

1284
01:20:39,581 --> 01:20:41,845
We didn't say anything bad about her.

1285
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:45,249
I don't want you talking to my friends
when I'm not around.

1286
01:20:45,554 --> 01:20:47,249
I'll make a note of that.

1287
01:20:54,696 --> 01:20:56,061
Donnie?

1288
01:20:56,732 --> 01:20:59,132
Did Linda Fletcher give you confidence?

1289
01:21:01,970 --> 01:21:04,871
You know damn well what she gave me,
don't try to be funny.

1290
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:08,842
I wasn't trying to be funny.
Did she also give you confidence?

1291
01:21:08,944 --> 01:21:10,002
Yes.

1292
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:12,504
Didn't I?

1293
01:21:14,316 --> 01:21:15,681
You gave me help.

1294
01:21:16,718 --> 01:21:19,915
-I always thought one led to the other.
-Not necessarily.

1295
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:25,153
Why didn't you ever tell me that
you don't like to be called Donnie?

1296
01:21:25,961 --> 01:21:28,054
I told you a thousand times.

1297
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:31,361
I'd certainly remember something
I've heard a thousand times.

1298
01:21:32,868 --> 01:21:35,268
Well, maybe it was only 999.

1299
01:21:36,205 --> 01:21:39,003
-What's wrong with Donnie?
-It reminds me of Donnie Dark.

1300
01:21:39,074 --> 01:21:40,701
What's wrong with that?

1301
01:21:41,476 --> 01:21:42,773
You work on it.

1302
01:21:43,779 --> 01:21:47,579
What would you like to be called?
I'll try to remember.

1303
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:51,283
Don. Donald.
You can call me, Sebastian, or Irving.

1304
01:21:51,353 --> 01:21:53,253
I don't care. Anything, but Donnie.

1305
01:21:53,322 --> 01:21:56,382
I'm certainly not going to call you
Sebastian or Irving.

1306
01:21:56,458 --> 01:21:59,188
I'll try to remember to call you Don.

1307
01:22:03,432 --> 01:22:04,797
She's back.

1308
01:22:05,367 --> 01:22:07,164
She'll be here in a minute.

1309
01:22:07,436 --> 01:22:08,630
You can go, Mom.

1310
01:22:08,704 --> 01:22:11,673
-There's a man with her.
-Stop listening at the door.

1311
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:12,707
I can't hear anything.

1312
01:22:12,774 --> 01:22:15,402
They must be in the living room.
There's a man with her.

1313
01:22:15,477 --> 01:22:16,944
probably her radio.

1314
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:20,073
Why would she be laughing
and talking with a radio?

1315
01:22:20,148 --> 01:22:23,379
-Please come away from there.
-I am away from there.

1316
01:22:25,354 --> 01:22:28,687
-Come in.
-Hi. I'm back.

1317
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:30,881
I brought Ralph Santori with me.

1318
01:22:31,593 --> 01:22:33,493
Mrs. Baker, you're still here.

1319
01:22:35,264 --> 01:22:37,562
Don, this is Ralph Santori.
I told you about him.

1320
01:22:37,633 --> 01:22:39,624
-He's directing the play.
-Glad to know you.

1321
01:22:39,701 --> 01:22:43,501
-Hi, Don.
-And this is Don's mother, Mrs. Baker.

1322
01:22:44,106 --> 01:22:45,835
How do you do, Mrs. Baker.

1323
01:22:45,907 --> 01:22:48,637
Don, I told Ralph all about you.
He's dying to meet you.

1324
01:22:48,710 --> 01:22:52,237
Jill told me, you know,
how with it you are.

1325
01:22:52,314 --> 01:22:55,374
How adept you are for someone who's,
for someone who can't see.

1326
01:22:55,450 --> 01:22:58,112
You can say blind, Ralph.
It's in my vocabulary, too.

1327
01:22:58,186 --> 01:23:00,518
I should have known.
You know, Jill told me.

1328
01:23:00,589 --> 01:23:03,752
-She said you had no hang-ups!
-Ralph, you don't have to shout.

1329
01:23:03,825 --> 01:23:05,850
Mr. Santori, my son is not deaf.

1330
01:23:07,062 --> 01:23:08,825
-Sorry.
-It happens all the time.

1331
01:23:08,897 --> 01:23:11,365
People think if you can't see,
you can't hear.

1332
01:23:11,433 --> 01:23:14,095
-He can hear better than we can.
-No, I can't.

1333
01:23:14,803 --> 01:23:16,532
And what a sense of smell.

1334
01:23:17,272 --> 01:23:20,764
-Can I fix you something before I leave?
-We already had dinner.

1335
01:23:20,909 --> 01:23:23,275
I wouldn't mind a little cup of coffee.

1336
01:23:25,647 --> 01:23:28,343
You were expected here for dinner, Jill.

1337
01:23:30,786 --> 01:23:33,812
-Don, I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1338
01:23:37,626 --> 01:23:39,651
Everything's so beautiful.

1339
01:23:40,395 --> 01:23:41,384
Candles.

1340
01:23:42,664 --> 01:23:43,824
Our flowers.

1341
01:23:48,236 --> 01:23:51,034
Well, that's me for you.

1342
01:23:51,606 --> 01:23:53,130
I completely forgot.

1343
01:23:53,308 --> 01:23:56,106
We went to this party
to celebrate and we drank...

1344
01:23:56,178 --> 01:23:58,339
...a bottle of champagne or whatever.

1345
01:23:58,413 --> 01:24:01,382
-It was sparkling burgundy.
-Then you got the part?

1346
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:04,881
Yes and no. I'm not playing the wife.

1347
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:09,216
-Are you playing the homosexual?
-No, his secretary.

1348
01:24:09,291 --> 01:24:11,623
It's a small part,
but I have one good scene.

1349
01:24:11,693 --> 01:24:13,388
She gave a great audition.
Man, was I proud of her.

1350
01:24:15,397 --> 01:24:17,297
-Were you nervous?
-Was I?

1351
01:24:17,599 --> 01:24:20,534
It wasn't the reading or anything,
but can you imagine...

1352
01:24:20,602 --> 01:24:24,265
...having to stand there
in front of those people completely naked?

1353
01:24:25,907 --> 01:24:28,307
I'm sorry. I broke a cup.

1354
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:30,207
Can I help you?

1355
01:24:30,312 --> 01:24:33,076
No, thank you. It's already broken.

1356
01:24:33,849 --> 01:24:37,307
-Sorry. How many coffees?
-I don't want any.

1357
01:24:37,786 --> 01:24:39,014
None for me.

1358
01:24:42,357 --> 01:24:44,757
Why did Jill have to be naked
for the audition?

1359
01:24:44,826 --> 01:24:47,420
There's a lot of nudity involved in this play.

1360
01:24:47,496 --> 01:24:51,592
We had to see the actors bodies.
You see, the visual here is very important.

1361
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:55,397
-I hope you don't mind my saying that.
-No, not at all.

1362
01:24:56,138 --> 01:24:58,606
How do you take your coffee, Mr. Santori?

1363
01:24:58,940 --> 01:25:00,066
Just black.

1364
01:25:00,509 --> 01:25:03,103
I don't think anyone could call me a prude.

1365
01:25:03,578 --> 01:25:06,706
I'd like to see them try.

1366
01:25:08,617 --> 01:25:12,610
Well, at first I hated the idea of getting
completely undressed...

1367
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:15,579
...but there were like 20 or 30 actors...

1368
01:25:15,657 --> 01:25:19,423
...all around me, all naked,
and I was the only one with clothes on.

1369
01:25:20,028 --> 01:25:22,826
-How would you feel?
-Warm, all over.

1370
01:25:22,898 --> 01:25:25,230
I was out front with my writer
and my producer.

1371
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:28,667
The minute we saw Jill naked,
we knew she wasn't right for the lead.

1372
01:25:28,737 --> 01:25:33,606
Tell me, Mr. Santori, is there any story
connected with this play...

1373
01:25:33,675 --> 01:25:35,199
...or is that too much to hope for?

1374
01:25:35,277 --> 01:25:37,575
It's a very dramatic story, Mrs. Baker.

1375
01:25:37,646 --> 01:25:39,113
I die in the end.

1376
01:25:39,448 --> 01:25:40,540
Pneumonia?

1377
01:25:41,716 --> 01:25:45,049
Jill's scene will be the wildest thing
they've seen on any stage.

1378
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:48,021
I can do this thing
better than anyone in the business.

1379
01:25:48,089 --> 01:25:50,990
She'll be lying there, naked...

1380
01:25:51,059 --> 01:25:53,186
...dying of an overdose of heroin.

1381
01:25:53,962 --> 01:25:57,557
Now she's in agony and she's writhing
across the stage on her back...

1382
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:59,827
...delirious, screaming.

1383
01:26:00,302 --> 01:26:02,930
Do you think the public really needs this?

1384
01:26:03,271 --> 01:26:06,001
Are you kidding? They're dying for it.

1385
01:26:06,274 --> 01:26:08,572
I'm talking about the thinking public...

1386
01:26:08,643 --> 01:26:12,101
...not all those little tight-assed matrons
up in Hillsborough.

1387
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:24,320
Have I said something wrong?

1388
01:26:24,693 --> 01:26:27,161
Pick anything, Mr. Santori.

1389
01:26:28,230 --> 01:26:31,199
Ralph, Mrs. Baker lives in Hillsborough.

1390
01:26:40,909 --> 01:26:41,898
Well.

1391
01:26:46,381 --> 01:26:48,110
Present company excepted.

1392
01:26:48,783 --> 01:26:50,045
Isn't that the rule?

1393
01:26:50,118 --> 01:26:52,279
I don't wish to be excepted, thank you.

1394
01:26:52,387 --> 01:26:54,947
Tell me, what is the name of your play?

1395
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:57,251
It's called <i>Do Unto Others</i>.

1396
01:26:57,325 --> 01:26:59,850
I must make a note of that, too.

1397
01:27:00,095 --> 01:27:03,189
You might like it, Mrs. Baker,
if you just gave it a chance.

1398
01:27:03,265 --> 01:27:05,426
You know, saw it with an open mind.

1399
01:27:07,202 --> 01:27:09,796
Mom hasn't liked anything since
<i>The Sound of Music</i>.

1400
01:27:09,871 --> 01:27:14,934
I think we might be able to make it
without the support of Hillsborough.

1401
01:27:15,143 --> 01:27:16,110
Good.

1402
01:27:16,177 --> 01:27:19,510
Because I wouldn't count on the support
of this giddy little matron.

1403
01:27:19,581 --> 01:27:23,915
I don't intend to pay to see nudity,
obscenity and degeneracy.

1404
01:27:23,985 --> 01:27:26,476
These things are all a part of life.

1405
01:27:26,555 --> 01:27:28,045
I know, Mr. Santori.

1406
01:27:28,156 --> 01:27:29,521
So is diarrhea...

1407
01:27:29,891 --> 01:27:32,587
...but I wouldn't classify it
as entertainment.

1408
01:27:34,162 --> 01:27:36,062
I think we'd better get going.

1409
01:27:36,131 --> 01:27:38,531
How long will it take you to get packed?

1410
01:27:39,034 --> 01:27:40,729
Not long. I only have two bags.

1411
01:27:40,802 --> 01:27:43,168
I'll pick up some food
while you're packing...

1412
01:27:43,238 --> 01:27:45,263
...and I'll meet you at the car.

1413
01:27:45,574 --> 01:27:47,064
You going somewhere?

1414
01:27:48,276 --> 01:27:52,144
Didn't I tell you? I'm moving in with Ralph.
I thought I mentioned it.

1415
01:27:52,213 --> 01:27:54,681
No, you didn't.

1416
01:27:54,749 --> 01:27:57,274
Well, this place is so tacky.

1417
01:27:57,352 --> 01:28:00,583
-Ralph thought it'd be good if I moved in.
-It was your idea.

1418
01:28:00,655 --> 01:28:03,749
It doesn't matter whose idea it was,
it was a good one.

1419
01:28:04,426 --> 01:28:07,486
Ralph has a terrific studio apartment.
Wait till you see it.

1420
01:28:07,562 --> 01:28:09,723
We want you to come over,
whenever you like.

1421
01:28:09,798 --> 01:28:12,289
If you're alone, just come on over.
Right, Ralph?

1422
01:28:12,367 --> 01:28:13,334
Right.

1423
01:28:13,802 --> 01:28:15,827
I told you you'd like Don.

1424
01:28:16,004 --> 01:28:19,030
We'll have groovy times over there.
You'll love Ralph.

1425
01:28:19,174 --> 01:28:20,471
He's one of us.

1426
01:28:20,642 --> 01:28:23,270
I wish you could see him.
He has a great face.

1427
01:28:24,412 --> 01:28:26,846
Ralph, let Don feel your face.

1428
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:30,748
He can tell what you look like
by feeling your face.

1429
01:28:30,819 --> 01:28:32,081
Go ahead, Don.

1430
01:28:32,387 --> 01:28:33,979
He doesn't want to.

1431
01:28:42,297 --> 01:28:44,663
Well, it's been great meeting you, Don.

1432
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,124
See you soon, I hope.

1433
01:28:49,404 --> 01:28:51,599
It was nice meeting you, Mrs. Baker.

1434
01:28:51,873 --> 01:28:53,807
I apologize if I offended you.

1435
01:28:54,242 --> 01:28:58,201
That's all right, Mr. Santori.
I assure you it won't happen again.

1436
01:29:25,306 --> 01:29:27,831
I'll stop in to say goodbye before I leave.

1437
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:46,224
Mom?

1438
01:29:49,364 --> 01:29:51,355
-Mom, are you here?
-Yes.

1439
01:29:53,802 --> 01:29:55,997
I have something I want to tell you.

1440
01:29:56,371 --> 01:29:57,963
Is it something awful?

1441
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:01,134
No, you'll like it, but you'd better sit down.

1442
01:30:01,209 --> 01:30:02,369
I'm sitting.

1443
01:30:04,879 --> 01:30:06,278
I want to go home.

1444
01:30:08,216 --> 01:30:10,241
You get the car and I'll pack.

1445
01:30:13,188 --> 01:30:15,247
-Did you hear me?
-Yes.

1446
01:30:15,890 --> 01:30:17,721
Why don't you say something?

1447
01:30:17,926 --> 01:30:19,621
I intend to.

1448
01:30:19,894 --> 01:30:21,691
I'm collecting my thoughts.

1449
01:30:21,963 --> 01:30:25,194
Well, do that while you get the car.
I won't be long.

1450
01:30:25,934 --> 01:30:27,196
Just a minute.

1451
01:30:28,369 --> 01:30:31,395
-I think we should talk about it.
-Talk about it?

1452
01:30:31,906 --> 01:30:33,498
Isn't that what you wanted?

1453
01:30:33,575 --> 01:30:35,668
Isn't that why you came here?

1454
01:30:35,744 --> 01:30:37,939
-Yes.
-Then what's to talk about?

1455
01:30:38,146 --> 01:30:42,139
You said it isn't Buckingham Palace.
You said I'm living in a rat hole.

1456
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:45,217
And you said it's the Taj Mahal.

1457
01:30:45,453 --> 01:30:47,751
Are you saying
you don't want me to come home?

1458
01:30:47,822 --> 01:30:48,652
No.

1459
01:30:49,090 --> 01:30:52,355
I'm only saying we should talk about it.
Now put the bag down.

1460
01:30:52,427 --> 01:30:54,725
-I'm coming home, Mother!
-Put it down!

1461
01:31:00,168 --> 01:31:02,227
Please don't misunderstand me.

1462
01:31:02,437 --> 01:31:04,428
I think this place is dreadful.

1463
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:08,167
I doubt I ever will.
But I didn't choose to live here. You did.

1464
01:31:08,243 --> 01:31:10,837
You couldn't wait to get
a place of your own.

1465
01:31:10,912 --> 01:31:13,039
You rushed into this, now you want out.

1466
01:31:13,114 --> 01:31:15,139
I think we should talk about it.

1467
01:31:15,316 --> 01:31:17,944
Isn't it funny how you and I
think exactly alike...

1468
01:31:18,019 --> 01:31:20,010
...only never at the same time.

1469
01:31:30,098 --> 01:31:31,998
I can't make it, Mom.

1470
01:31:32,934 --> 01:31:35,198
I just know I'm not going to make it.

1471
01:31:36,604 --> 01:31:37,468
Why?

1472
01:31:38,106 --> 01:31:40,336
Because a girl has walked out on you?

1473
01:31:40,408 --> 01:31:44,310
-Two girls. Let's don't forget Linda.
-And it could be 10 girls.

1474
01:31:44,379 --> 01:31:46,939
Girls walk out on sighted men, too,
you know.

1475
01:31:47,015 --> 01:31:49,176
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

1476
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:52,344
It's supposed to make you
stop feeling sorry for yourself.

1477
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:56,083
You haven't felt sorry for yourself before,
please don't start now.

1478
01:31:57,258 --> 01:31:59,749
You're going to meet so many girls.

1479
01:31:59,828 --> 01:32:03,389
One day you'll meet one who's capable
of a permanent relationship.

1480
01:32:03,464 --> 01:32:05,659
Jill isn't. She knows this herself.

1481
01:32:09,037 --> 01:32:13,497
I really think that you're better off
staying here for right now.

1482
01:32:13,808 --> 01:32:16,470
I don't want you coming home
discouraged and defeated.

1483
01:32:16,544 --> 01:32:18,535
-You've got your music.
-Christ!

1484
01:32:18,613 --> 01:32:22,014
For once, will you get it into your head
I'm not Little Donnie Dark?

1485
01:32:22,083 --> 01:32:25,018
You're goddamn right I'm discouraged.
I am defeated!

1486
01:32:26,154 --> 01:32:27,246
It's over.

1487
01:32:28,957 --> 01:32:31,448
Do you remember
the first Donnie Dark story?

1488
01:32:32,627 --> 01:32:33,651
No.

1489
01:32:34,462 --> 01:32:35,986
You were five years old.

1490
01:32:36,064 --> 01:32:38,430
We were spending the summer
at Lake Tahoe.

1491
01:32:38,499 --> 01:32:39,693
Dad took you into the lake.

1492
01:32:39,834 --> 01:32:42,860
It was first time you'd been in water
deeper than your bathtub.

1493
01:32:42,937 --> 01:32:46,805
You were terrified. They could hear you
screaming all over California.

1494
01:32:46,975 --> 01:32:50,035
Dad brought you in and I put you to bed.
You trembled for hours.

1495
01:32:50,111 --> 01:32:52,443
That night I told you a story
about a blind boy...

1496
01:32:52,513 --> 01:32:54,743
...who could swim the seas,
and talk to dolphins.

1497
01:32:54,816 --> 01:32:56,943
The dolphins told him about
the enemy submarines...

1498
01:32:57,018 --> 01:32:59,418
...that were coming to destroy
the U.S. Navy...

1499
01:32:59,487 --> 01:33:02,422
...and Donnie Dark swam ashore,
in time to save them.

1500
01:33:03,191 --> 01:33:04,453
A lot of crap.

1501
01:33:06,027 --> 01:33:08,621
The next day you learned to swim.

1502
01:33:09,697 --> 01:33:13,394
I didn't write those stories
hoping for a Pulitzer Prize in literature.

1503
01:33:13,468 --> 01:33:15,493
I wrote them because
I found a way to help.

1504
01:33:15,570 --> 01:33:18,403
Whenever you were discouraged,
I told you another story.

1505
01:33:18,473 --> 01:33:21,965
You tried a little harder,
and you did a little better.

1506
01:33:25,446 --> 01:33:28,677
Shall I make up a story now,
or are you man enough...

1507
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:30,945
...to handle the situation yourself?

1508
01:33:33,021 --> 01:33:35,717
A month ago,
you didn't think I was man enough.

1509
01:33:37,091 --> 01:33:39,389
You said I wasn't ready to leave home.

1510
01:33:39,694 --> 01:33:41,218
Why have you changed?

1511
01:33:43,398 --> 01:33:45,263
How do you know that I've changed?

1512
01:33:45,333 --> 01:33:47,927
You're not the boy
who left home a month ago.

1513
01:33:48,069 --> 01:33:50,594
I came down here today
hoping that you were.

1514
01:33:55,610 --> 01:33:57,009
You know, Donnie...

1515
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:02,316
...it's not easy to adjust...

1516
01:34:03,151 --> 01:34:05,142
...to not being needed anymore.

1517
01:34:05,987 --> 01:34:09,514
I can do it now,
and you get on with your own life.

1518
01:34:13,561 --> 01:34:16,587
I'd like to see you have
some decent furniture.

1519
01:34:17,432 --> 01:34:19,798
Some dishes and some glasses.

1520
01:34:20,435 --> 01:34:21,834
I'll send some up.

1521
01:34:22,670 --> 01:34:23,762
Okay.

1522
01:34:25,974 --> 01:34:27,100
And linens.

1523
01:34:28,209 --> 01:34:29,574
Bigger ashtrays.

1524
01:34:34,182 --> 01:34:35,308
You know...

1525
01:34:35,950 --> 01:34:39,010
...if you fix this place up,
it might not be so bad.

1526
01:34:41,489 --> 01:34:43,684
Could I help you fix it up a little?

1527
01:34:46,327 --> 01:34:47,419
Sure.

1528
01:34:50,298 --> 01:34:53,267
I'll call you in the morning
and We'll talk about it.

1529
01:34:55,236 --> 01:34:56,294
Mom?

1530
01:35:01,342 --> 01:35:02,832
I'm glad you came.

1531
01:35:15,189 --> 01:35:16,781
I love you, Don.

1532
01:35:19,027 --> 01:35:20,426
I know, Mom.

1533
01:35:21,562 --> 01:35:22,824
I know you do.

1534
01:36:07,108 --> 01:36:08,473
How are you doing?

1535
01:36:08,910 --> 01:36:10,537
I'll be right in.

1536
01:36:20,988 --> 01:36:23,684
Well, I guess I got everything.

1537
01:36:24,158 --> 01:36:27,616
I left my dishtowels and light bulbs
in the kitchen if you want them.

1538
01:36:27,695 --> 01:36:29,560
Thanks. I don't need them.

1539
01:36:32,233 --> 01:36:34,758
Let's not have any big good-byes
or anything.

1540
01:36:35,336 --> 01:36:38,305
-I'll be in touch with you.
-Can't you stay a minute?

1541
01:36:38,806 --> 01:36:41,673
Once I'm going somewhere
I like to get going, you know?

1542
01:36:41,742 --> 01:36:42,834
I'm the same way.

1543
01:36:42,910 --> 01:36:45,310
I was going to have
a corned beef sandwich on rye.

1544
01:36:45,379 --> 01:36:46,539
Do you want one?

1545
01:36:46,614 --> 01:36:48,673
Once I'm going, I like to get going...

1546
01:36:48,749 --> 01:36:52,014
...unless somebody offers me
a corned beef sandwich on rye.

1547
01:36:56,290 --> 01:37:00,624
I locked the door from the inside.
Will you give the key to the janitor for me?

1548
01:37:00,728 --> 01:37:01,592
Sure.

1549
01:37:02,163 --> 01:37:04,427
I'm putting it here on the table.

1550
01:37:04,732 --> 01:37:07,132
You'd better have him lock up
that door again.

1551
01:37:07,201 --> 01:37:10,170
I'll wait and see who moves in.
It might be someone groovy.

1552
01:37:10,238 --> 01:37:12,035
Yeah, I hope so.

1553
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:14,164
You want a beer?

1554
01:37:14,408 --> 01:37:15,500
Yeah.

1555
01:37:16,844 --> 01:37:19,870
-The candles are still lit.
-I'm very religious.

1556
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:23,778
Where's Mama?

1557
01:37:23,885 --> 01:37:25,147
She went home.

1558
01:37:25,653 --> 01:37:27,177
What was the verdict?

1559
01:37:27,321 --> 01:37:29,846
She accepted
my declaration of independence.

1560
01:37:29,991 --> 01:37:31,583
-You're kidding?
-No.

1561
01:37:31,926 --> 01:37:34,190
I must say she put up a great battle.

1562
01:37:35,663 --> 01:37:37,790
Maybe she should have won.

1563
01:37:38,099 --> 01:37:41,262
-Maybe you'd be better off at home.
-Now that's a switch.

1564
01:37:42,770 --> 01:37:45,295
-I've been thinking about it.
-Come on, girl.

1565
01:37:45,373 --> 01:37:48,536
It took me a day, and three pints of blood
to convince my mother.

1566
01:37:48,609 --> 01:37:52,545
-I don't have to start on you.
-Well, I like to have things done for me.

1567
01:37:52,613 --> 01:37:55,878
Then give up Ralph and the play
and move in with my mother.

1568
01:37:56,317 --> 01:37:59,013
-I'm out of mustard.
-I don't care.

1569
01:38:01,189 --> 01:38:03,316
What did you think of Ralph?

1570
01:38:04,559 --> 01:38:05,821
Where are you?

1571
01:38:06,527 --> 01:38:07,892
I'm on the sofa.

1572
01:38:08,796 --> 01:38:11,094
I couldn't tell where your voice
was coming from.

1573
01:38:11,165 --> 01:38:13,998
-You always could before.
-I wasn't concentrating.

1574
01:38:14,235 --> 01:38:15,827
He seemed very nice.

1575
01:38:15,970 --> 01:38:17,232
-Who?
-Ralph.

1576
01:38:17,772 --> 01:38:18,932
You didn't like him.

1577
01:38:19,006 --> 01:38:21,668
-He seemed very nice.
-I could tell you didn't like him.

1578
01:38:21,742 --> 01:38:22,606
You were uptight.

1579
01:38:22,677 --> 01:38:24,770
I'm uptight
when there's more than one person.

1580
01:38:24,845 --> 01:38:26,472
I have to figure out who's speaking.

1581
01:38:26,547 --> 01:38:29,414
-You didn't like him because he was rude.
-Was he rude?

1582
01:38:29,483 --> 01:38:32,043
Well, putting down Hillsborough
and your mother.

1583
01:38:32,119 --> 01:38:35,054
That was an accident.
I'm sorry you think he's rude.

1584
01:38:35,456 --> 01:38:38,323
-I don't think he's rude.
-You said it, I didn't.

1585
01:38:38,559 --> 01:38:40,254
Or is there someone else here?

1586
01:38:40,328 --> 01:38:43,229
I know he comes off as a little conceited.

1587
01:38:43,297 --> 01:38:45,822
Tell me, Jill, do you like Ralph?

1588
01:38:48,169 --> 01:38:50,330
What kind of a question is that?

1589
01:38:51,105 --> 01:38:54,632
I'm moving in with him, why would I
move in with a guy I don't like?

1590
01:38:55,076 --> 01:38:56,805
That was my next question.

1591
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:00,843
Well, I'd better be going.

1592
01:39:01,315 --> 01:39:04,375
-Ralph's waiting and--
-I guess I don't like Ralph.

1593
01:39:04,752 --> 01:39:08,654
-I knew it all along. But why?
-Like you said, he's rude and conceited.

1594
01:39:08,723 --> 01:39:12,454
I knew that's what you thought,
but he only seems that way.

1595
01:39:13,728 --> 01:39:15,992
I hoped that we could all be friends.

1596
01:39:16,397 --> 01:39:17,694
Did you really?

1597
01:39:19,634 --> 01:39:21,966
Well, thanks for the sandwich.

1598
01:39:22,103 --> 01:39:23,593
I'd better be going.

1599
01:39:24,005 --> 01:39:27,031
I'll tell you something:
You don't like Ralph Santori.

1600
01:39:28,276 --> 01:39:29,140
God!

1601
01:39:29,343 --> 01:39:32,870
I packed two bags,
so I can move in with him.

1602
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:35,981
I don't care if you've got 13 trunks.
You don't like him.

1603
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:38,416
You really are something.

1604
01:39:38,586 --> 01:39:41,146
You think because you're blind,
you see everything.

1605
01:39:41,222 --> 01:39:42,154
Right.

1606
01:39:42,323 --> 01:39:44,985
That sixth sense tells me
you don't like Ralph Santori.

1607
01:39:45,059 --> 01:39:48,324
-Spooky, isn't it?
-No, it's just stupid.

1608
01:39:48,663 --> 01:39:51,393
I packed two big bags,
sitting right over there.

1609
01:39:51,465 --> 01:39:55,060
Tell me, Jill, with Ralph is it
like the Fourth of July and Christmas?

1610
01:39:57,071 --> 01:39:58,470
Not exactly.

1611
01:39:59,707 --> 01:40:02,039
He has a kind of strength.

1612
01:40:03,477 --> 01:40:05,604
With him it's more like Labor Day.

1613
01:40:07,248 --> 01:40:09,739
Do you think he's a beautiful person, too?

1614
01:40:10,484 --> 01:40:12,679
-In many ways, yes.
-Do you love him?

1615
01:40:12,820 --> 01:40:14,310
Why should I answer that?

1616
01:40:14,388 --> 01:40:16,982
No matter what I say
you've made up your mind.

1617
01:40:17,058 --> 01:40:19,856
-Answer it. Do you love him?
-Yes, in my way.

1618
01:40:19,927 --> 01:40:21,827
Yesterday, you told me you couldn't love.

1619
01:40:21,896 --> 01:40:24,626
-That was yesterday.
-I'm not the worldliest person...

1620
01:40:24,699 --> 01:40:27,532
...but when you rush into the arms
of the man you love...

1621
01:40:27,768 --> 01:40:29,861
...you don't stop for a sandwich!

1622
01:40:30,104 --> 01:40:32,129
Was it something my mother said?

1623
01:40:32,873 --> 01:40:35,068
Was what something your mother said?

1624
01:40:37,678 --> 01:40:40,806
Why you're leaving?
The reason you didn't show up for dinner.

1625
01:40:40,881 --> 01:40:42,610
I know you didn't forget.

1626
01:40:43,451 --> 01:40:45,442
Is it something my mother said?

1627
01:40:46,454 --> 01:40:48,752
You don't listen to your mother,
why should I?

1628
01:40:48,823 --> 01:40:52,725
Then why are you leaving?
Don't give me that crap about loving Ralph.

1629
01:40:52,927 --> 01:40:55,395
I'm leaving because I want to leave.

1630
01:40:55,763 --> 01:40:59,028
I am free and I go when I want to go,
all right?

1631
01:41:01,202 --> 01:41:03,932
I thought it might have
something to do with me.

1632
01:41:04,505 --> 01:41:06,973
It has nothing whatsoever to do with you.

1633
01:41:08,409 --> 01:41:09,501
Okay.

1634
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:15,313
You're scared to death
of becoming involved, aren't you?

1635
01:41:15,383 --> 01:41:17,146
I told you all about that.

1636
01:41:17,518 --> 01:41:20,976
That's right, you told me,
no responsibilities, no commitments.

1637
01:41:21,756 --> 01:41:25,192
It's just that I have to be able to get out,
if I get tired--

1638
01:41:25,259 --> 01:41:26,419
Of me?

1639
01:41:27,428 --> 01:41:29,828
-Of anybody.
-What if I got tired of you?

1640
01:41:30,364 --> 01:41:33,333
-Of me?
-Doesn't anyone ever get tired of you?

1641
01:41:33,401 --> 01:41:34,493
I don't know.

1642
01:41:34,568 --> 01:41:37,093
I don't hang around long enough
to find out.

1643
01:41:37,338 --> 01:41:41,798
With Ralph, you could walk out anytime
but it might be a harder on a blind guy.

1644
01:41:41,876 --> 01:41:45,243
-Blindness has nothing to do with it.
-You know goddamn well it has!

1645
01:41:45,312 --> 01:41:48,645
You wouldn't feel it walking out
on Ralph or Sebastian or Irving...

1646
01:41:48,716 --> 01:41:52,243
...but walk out on Donnie, you'd hate
yourself and you wouldn't like that.

1647
01:41:52,319 --> 01:41:55,186
Well hate me or love me...

1648
01:41:55,556 --> 01:41:57,786
...but don't leave because I'm blind.

1649
01:41:57,858 --> 01:41:59,951
And don't stay because I'm blind.

1650
01:42:04,965 --> 01:42:07,297
Who are Sebastian and Irving?

1651
01:42:08,969 --> 01:42:10,300
Nobody.

1652
01:42:13,140 --> 01:42:15,438
Sometimes I just don't understand you.

1653
01:42:16,677 --> 01:42:18,872
I mean, we really don't think alike.

1654
01:42:20,247 --> 01:42:22,738
I know I'd only hurt you, sooner or later.

1655
01:42:23,551 --> 01:42:25,280
I don't want to hurt you.

1656
01:42:26,187 --> 01:42:27,176
Why not?

1657
01:42:27,354 --> 01:42:30,289
You can do it to others.
Why am I an exception?

1658
01:42:33,694 --> 01:42:37,425
Well, I just don't want to be
another Linda Fletcher.

1659
01:42:37,998 --> 01:42:39,693
She hurt you, didn't she?

1660
01:42:39,767 --> 01:42:41,598
Yes, but she helped me, too.

1661
01:42:42,102 --> 01:42:44,127
She was there when I needed her.

1662
01:42:44,472 --> 01:42:46,201
I can't promise that.

1663
01:42:46,707 --> 01:42:49,904
I don't know where I'll be
when you need me.

1664
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:55,415
GirI, you need me
a hell of a lot more than I need you.

1665
01:42:55,649 --> 01:42:59,107
I don't need anybody.
I never did and I never will.

1666
01:43:01,489 --> 01:43:02,854
I have to go now.

1667
01:43:03,324 --> 01:43:05,815
I'm glad you said have to, and not want to.

1668
01:43:06,227 --> 01:43:08,252
I finally said something right.

1669
01:43:13,033 --> 01:43:14,500
I'll be seeing you.

1670
01:43:18,672 --> 01:43:20,435
Yeah, be seeing you.

1671
01:43:23,010 --> 01:43:25,103
I'll think about you for years...

1672
01:43:25,312 --> 01:43:27,803
...and wonder if you ever made
a commitment...

1673
01:43:27,882 --> 01:43:29,713
...if you ever got involved.

1674
01:43:31,285 --> 01:43:32,650
I hope not.

1675
01:43:35,556 --> 01:43:36,818
Don't worry...

1676
01:43:37,892 --> 01:43:39,359
...it won't happen.

1677
01:43:40,294 --> 01:43:42,023
It can't...

1678
01:43:42,229 --> 01:43:45,027
...because you're emotionally retarded,
you know?

1679
01:43:45,132 --> 01:43:46,963
That's why you couldn't face marriage.

1680
01:43:47,034 --> 01:43:49,298
That's why you can't face
anything permanent.

1681
01:43:49,370 --> 01:43:51,395
You're afraid you'll fall in love with me...

1682
01:43:51,472 --> 01:43:53,599
...and you're too adolescent
for that responsibility.

1683
01:43:53,674 --> 01:43:57,667
You're going to stay that way
the rest of your life, thinking you're free.

1684
01:43:58,078 --> 01:43:59,909
God, I feel sorry for you...

1685
01:44:01,382 --> 01:44:03,179
...because you're crippled.

1686
01:44:03,551 --> 01:44:05,041
I'd rather be blind.

1687
01:44:59,306 --> 01:45:00,398
Taxi!

1688
01:45:01,075 --> 01:45:02,406
Hey, Jill!

1689
01:45:08,749 --> 01:45:09,977
Come on.

1690
01:47:10,738 --> 01:47:11,830
Who is it?

1691
01:47:12,506 --> 01:47:13,666
Who's there?

1692
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:20,845
The news is good.

1693
01:47:21,648 --> 01:47:23,138
It's not your mother.

1694
01:47:25,652 --> 01:47:27,347
What are you doing here?

1695
01:47:29,656 --> 01:47:31,681
What are you doing on the floor?

1696
01:47:34,628 --> 01:47:36,528
I was about to have a picnic.

1697
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:40,865
Without me?

1698
01:47:43,537 --> 01:47:45,437
I didn't know I had a choice.

1699
01:47:48,976 --> 01:47:52,343
You're going to be proud of me
when I tell you what happened.

1700
01:47:52,813 --> 01:47:53,677
What?

1701
01:47:54,248 --> 01:47:55,510
Shadow vision.

1702
01:47:57,417 --> 01:47:58,782
What do you mean?

1703
01:47:59,586 --> 01:48:00,985
Well, I can do it.

1704
01:48:01,555 --> 01:48:03,523
I just did it. It was incredible.

1705
01:48:03,590 --> 01:48:06,855
I came within one foot of this obstacle
and I stopped cold.

1706
01:48:07,494 --> 01:48:09,189
What was it, a lamppost?

1707
01:48:10,197 --> 01:48:11,095
No.

1708
01:48:12,499 --> 01:48:13,830
It was Ralph.

1709
01:48:24,011 --> 01:48:25,842
I have a confession to make.

1710
01:48:28,949 --> 01:48:30,780
I cheated just a little.

1711
01:48:32,386 --> 01:48:33,785
My eyes were open.

1712
01:48:40,394 --> 01:48:41,986
Well, it's about time.

1712
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,086
