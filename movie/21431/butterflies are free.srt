1
00:00:27,968 --> 00:00:34,619
蝴蝶是自由的

2
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:03,325
<i>"I knew the day you met me</i>

3
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:07,801
<i>"I could love you if you let me</i>

4
00:02:07,874 --> 00:02:11,275
<i>"Though you touched my cheek</i>
<i>and said how</i>

5
00:02:12,646 --> 00:02:14,910
<i>"easy you'd forget me</i>

6
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:37,631
<i>"On that velvet morning</i>

7
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:41,166
<i>"when our love was forming</i>

8
00:02:42,442 --> 00:02:44,808
<i>"I said it wouldn't hurt me</i>

9
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,143
<i>"if you left me without warning"</i>

10
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:53,601
我很好，谢谢，你呢？
I'm fine, thank you. How are you?

11
00:04:54,874 --> 00:04:56,307
这里天气很暖和
It's warm here.

12
00:04:57,143 --> 00:04:58,872
希尔斯波路天气如何？
How is it in Hillsborough?

13
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:01,608
很好，也很温暖
Well, it's warm here, too.

14
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:03,974
你好，母亲
Hello, Mother.

15
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,144
<i>你怎么知道是我？</i>
<i>你来电话的时候，响的不是铃声</i>
<i>-How did you know?</i>
<i>-When you call, the phone doesn't ring.</i>

16
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,381
<i>而是说，“M”代表着她有百万资产</i>
<i>It says, "M" is for the million things she gave.</i>

17
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:11,856
<i>“O”代表……我忘记代表什么了</i>
<i>"O" is.... I forgot what O is for.</i>

18
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,855
最近你似乎很健忘
You seemed to have forgotten a lot of things lately.

19
00:05:14,928 --> 00:05:18,227
感觉怎么样？
我很好，谢谢，你呢？
-How are you feeling?
-I'm fine, thank you. How are you?

20
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:20,925
<i>非常好，你那天气如何？</i>
<i>Very well. How's the weather?</i>

21
00:05:21,234 --> 00:05:23,566
很温暖。希尔斯波路的天气如何？
It's warm here. How's it in Hillsborough?

22
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:25,969
<i>很暖和</i>
也很温暖
<i>-Warm.</i>
-It's warm here, too.

23
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,940
公寓怎么样？
<i>哦，好极了！我喜欢</i>
-How's the apartment?
<i>-Oh, great! I love it.</i>

24
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:32,137
昨晚你在干嘛？
昨晚？我没做什么。
-What'd you do last night?
-Last night? I didn't do anything.

25
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:35,113
我意思是，我没有出门。有些朋友来访
I mean, I didn't go out. I had some friends in.

26
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:37,212
就是一个小聚会
It was just a little party.

27
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:41,052
我不太清楚来了几个人
I don't know how many people there were.

28
00:05:41,287 --> 00:05:43,187
你有必要知道人数吗？
Do you have to have a number?

29
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:46,186
12到18个吧，怎么了？
他们呆得晚吗？
-Twelve and a half. How's that?
-Did they stay late?

30
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,692
<i>他们没有呆得太晚</i>
<i>They didn't stay too late.</i>

31
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:50,025
我想去看看你
不！
-I'd like to come by and see you.
-No!

32
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:53,060
唐尼，不管怎么说，我明天要进城
Donnie, I'm coming into town tomorrow, anyway.

33
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:56,261
我得去趟塞克斯百货
我说不，这就是我的意思
-I have to go to Saks.
-I said no, and I mean it.

34
00:05:57,871 --> 00:06:00,169
我不在乎，我说不要
I don't give a damn, I said no.

35
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,170
因为我们有个约定，这就是原因
Because we had an agreement, that's why.

36
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:08,681
我们都同意有两个月的时间
We agreed to two months.

37
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:11,510
现在还剩下一个月，我非常珍惜余下的每一分钟
I have one month left and I want every minute of it.

38
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:15,111
唐尼，你太气人了，我都快哭了
Donnie, you are so irritating. I could absolutely cry.

39
00:06:15,422 --> 00:06:16,446
<i>什么？</i>
<i>What?</i>

40
00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:19,691
什么这么吵？
隔壁的声音
-What is that noise?
-It's coming from next door.

41
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:21,757
<i>谁住在隔壁？</i>
一个女孩
<i>-Who lives next door?</i>
-A girl.

42
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:23,022
她叫什么名字？
What's her name?

43
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:27,931
我不知道，我还没见过她，我几乎听不到你的声音了。明天再打来电话吧
I don't know. I haven't met her yet. I can hardly hear you. Call me tomorrow.

44
00:06:41,414 --> 00:06:44,144
嗨！你可以把电视关小声点吗？
Hey! Will you lower your television?

45
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:46,717
我听不见。你等一下
I can't hear you. Wait a minute.

46
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,920
对不起，刚才没听清楚你说的
Sorry. I couldn't hear you.

47
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:51,183
请把电视关小声点
Please lower your television.

48
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:53,817
你没必要把它关掉，只要小声一点
You don't have to turn it off. Just hold it down.

49
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:56,157
不是电视机，是收音机
It's not a television. It's a radio.

50
00:06:56,362 --> 00:06:59,525
不管是什么，这墙像纸一样薄
我知道
-Whatever. The walls are like paper.
-I know.

51
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,097
你几乎能透过它看到隔壁
You can practically see through them.

52
00:07:02,235 --> 00:07:03,532
不，实际上还没到这地步
No, not really.

53
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:07,930
嗨，来杯咖啡怎么样？
Hey, how about a cup of coffee?

54
00:07:08,141 --> 00:07:09,836
不，谢谢，我刚喝过了
No, thank you. I just had some.

55
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:10,807
我意思是给我来一杯
I meant for me.

56
00:07:12,512 --> 00:07:14,207
当然，过来吧
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

57
00:07:15,148 --> 00:07:17,013
好的
Okay.

58
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:32,690
门开着
It's open.

59
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:37,333
嗨，我是吉尔・汤尔
Hi. I'm Jill Tanner.

60
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:40,664
唐・贝克
能帮我把衬衣的拉链拉一下吗？
-Don Baker.
-Would you mind zipping up my blouse?

61
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,432
背后我够不着，希望你不介意我的不请自来。
I can't reach back there. Hope you don't mind my inviting myself in.

62
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:46,706
一点也不，水一会儿就烧开了
Not at all. Water will be hot in a minute.

63
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,271
你的卧室比我的大多了
Your living room is much bigger than mine.

64
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:52,376
很好
Nice.

65
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:56,586
你在这里住多久了？
一个月，那不是卧室
-How long have you been here?
-A month. That's not the living room.

66
00:07:56,656 --> 00:07:59,250
这是整个公寓，加上浴室
That's the whole apartment plus the bathroom.

67
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:02,053
如果你算上厨房，一共有三个房间
I've got three rooms, if you count the kitchen.

68
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:03,761
天，你这里真整洁
God, you're neat.

69
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:08,157
每件东西都井井有条
Everything's so tidy.

70
00:08:08,334 --> 00:08:10,393
因为什么都没有，所以看起来整洁
It's easy when you haven't got anything.

71
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,439
我也没什么东西，但却能弄得
I don't have anything, but it manages to wind up...

72
00:08:13,506 --> 00:08:15,098
满地都是
...all over the place.

73
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:18,641
恐怕我是个懒汉
I'm afraid I'm a slob.

74
00:08:21,181 --> 00:08:24,708
哦，嘿，我喜欢你的天窗
Oh, hey, I like your skylight.

75
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:27,418
我那里没有
I don't have one.

76
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:29,448
这是什么？
什么？
-What's this?
-What?

77
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:31,046
铁柱上的东西
This thing on stilts.

78
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:32,453
那是我的床
That's my bed.

79
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:33,921
你的床！
Your bed!

80
00:08:34,861 --> 00:08:36,192
哇！
Wow!

81
00:08:37,664 --> 00:08:38,926
真野性！
This is wild!

82
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,423
你喜欢？
You like it?

83
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,960
这是我所见过的最好的床了，我见过很多床
Oh, it's the greatest bed I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of beds.

84
00:08:45,972 --> 00:08:47,132
你怎么建的？
Did you build it?

85
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:49,835
在我之前这公寓住着一些嬉皮士，他们建的
No, some hippies lived here before me. They built it.

86
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:51,433
你没睡掉下来过？
Suppose you fall out?

87
00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:54,274
哟，你会摔坏什么的
Gee, you could break something.

88
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:56,838
从任何床上滚下来都会摔坏什么的
You could break something falling out of any bed.

89
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,076
那倒是
That's true.

90
00:08:58,384 --> 00:09:01,251
就是因为这张床，我没有挑你那间而挑了这间
I could've had your apartment. I took this one for the bed.

91
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:02,845
加奶油还是糖？
Cream or sugar?

92
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:05,857
只要黑咖啡，谢谢
Just black, thanks.

93
00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:12,663
给你
谢谢，这杯咖啡真救了我的命
-Here you go.
-Thanks. This coffee will save my life.

94
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,628
我带了花，还有餐巾、擦餐具的干布之类的蠢东西
I bought flowers and dumb things like dishtowels, paper napkins...

95
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:19,171
就是忘记了咖啡
...but I forgot coffee.

96
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,833
你需要点餐巾纸或者干布吗？
You need any dishtowels or paper napkins?

97
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:23,739
不
No.

98
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,741
我也带了点电灯泡
I got some light bulbs, too.

99
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,772
我能问你一个私人问题吗？
May I ask you a personal question?

100
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:29,746
当然可以
Yeah, sure.

101
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:32,717
为什么你不想让你母亲来这儿？
你怎么知道的？
-Why don't you want your mother here?
-How'd you know that?

102
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:35,185
呃，如果你能听到我的声音，我自然也能听到你的
Well, if you can hear me, I can hear you.

103
00:09:35,255 --> 00:09:38,486
我猜声音就是从那扇门的下面传过来的
I guess the sound must come right up from under that door.

104
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:40,422
不过，那扇门是用来干什么的？
What's that door for, anyway?

105
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,324
你的那间公寓和我的这间曾经是一间公寓
Your apartment and mine were once one apartment.

106
00:09:43,396 --> 00:09:47,492
当他们把公寓隔成两间的时候，只是把门锁上，而不是封闭掉
When they converted it into two, they just locked that instead of sealing it.

107
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:51,031
你还没回答我的问题
我忘记你问什么了
-You didn't answer my question.
-I forgot what you asked.

108
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,365
为什么你不想让你母亲来这里？
Why don't you want your mother here?

109
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:55,105
说起来话长
It's a long story.

110
00:09:55,408 --> 00:09:58,343
不，故事很短。但发生的过程却很长
No, it's a short story. It's been going on for a long time.

111
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:01,938
她不想让我离开家。她觉得我无法独立生活
She didn't want me to leave home. She thinks I can't make it on my own.

112
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:04,813
最后，我们达成协议，让我试着独立生活2个月
Finally, we agreed letting me try it for two months.

113
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:08,411
她将离开我2个月，我已经坚持了一个月了
She's to keep away from me for two months. I got a month to go.

114
00:10:08,988 --> 00:10:11,218
为什么你告诉她你办了一个聚会？
Why did you tell her you had a party?

115
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:14,727
你听得很仔细啊！
就只听到一点
-You don't miss anything in there, do you?
-Very little.

116
00:10:14,994 --> 00:10:17,622
我总是告诉她我办了一个聚会，或者我参加了一个
I always tell her I had a party or that I went to one.

117
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:18,721
她不会理解……
She wouldn't understand...

118
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:22,461
我为什么宁可独自一人，也不愿意和她还有编剧公司在一起
...why I'd rather be alone, than keeping her and the cook company.

119
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:24,660
她会恨这个地方的
She's going to hate this place.

120
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:26,967
她看都不用看，就已经恨这个地方了
She hates it now without even seeing it.

121
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,168
她会走进来说，“我都要哭了”
She'll walk in and say, "I could absolutely cry."

122
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,640
她常常哭吗？
不，仅仅是威胁
-Does she cry a lot?
-No, just threatens to.

123
00:10:32,712 --> 00:10:35,738
如果她真的要哭，把她带到我的公寓，让她看看
If she really wants to cry, send her in to look at my place.

124
00:10:35,815 --> 00:10:37,339
至少，你这里整洁多了
At least you're neat.

125
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:40,851
你知道，你的年纪已经可以独立生活了
我19岁
You know, you're old enough to live alone.
I'm 19.

126
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:44,320
你多大了？
根据我母亲的想法，我11岁
-How old are you?
-As far as my mother's concerned, I'm 11.

127
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,687
快到10岁了
Going on 10.

128
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:48,559
我们一定有相同的母亲
We must have the same mother.

129
00:10:48,761 --> 00:10:53,198
我的母亲喜欢我的一生都长不大，这样她就不会老
My mother would love for me to stay a child all my life so she won't age.

130
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,963
她喜欢人们对她说我们俩看上去像姐妹
She loves it when people say to her we look like sisters.

131
00:10:57,036 --> 00:10:59,334
即使人们不这样说，她也会这样告诉他们的
And if they don't say it, she tells them.

132
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:00,872
你有工作了吗？
Have you got a job?

133
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:03,340
没有，但是我会弹吉它，还获得一点机会
No, but I play guitar and I got a few prospects.

134
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:04,398
我明白了
I know.

135
00:11:05,878 --> 00:11:07,470
我昨晚听见你弹了
I heard you last night.

136
00:11:07,547 --> 00:11:10,516
哦，对不起
不，弹得非常好，真的！
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-No. It was good. Really!

137
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,685
我还以为是录音带呢，直到我听到重复弹
I thought it was a record till I kept hearing it over again.

138
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:15,880
我不会看谱子，所以我边听边模仿
I can't read music, so I got to learn by ear.

139
00:11:16,055 --> 00:11:18,580
我正试图整合成一场表演
然后呢？
-I'm trying to put together an act.
-And then what?

140
00:11:18,658 --> 00:11:20,683
我要试图靠这些主意赚钱
I'll try to cash in on some of those ideas.

141
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,490
我只知道一件事情：我不打算回希尔斯波路
I know one thing: I'm not going back to Hillsborough.

142
00:11:23,563 --> 00:11:26,031
什么是希尔斯波路？
你不知道希尔斯波路？
-What's Hillsborough?
-You don't know Hillsborough?

143
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:28,533
我对这里再往上的地方知道的不多
I don't know much about any place up here.

144
00:11:28,601 --> 00:11:31,729
我从洛杉矶来。我从来没去过比大瑟尔更北的地方
I'm from Los Angeles. I've never been north of the Big Sur.

145
00:11:31,804 --> 00:11:34,272
希尔斯波路离这里大约10英里
Hillsborough is about 10 miles from here.

146
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,171
那儿是你住的地方吗？
不是
-Is that where you live?
-No.

147
00:11:36,376 --> 00:11:39,436
我住在这里。那是我过去住的地方
好吧
-I live here. It's where I used to live.
-All right.

148
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:41,441
你说你的名字叫什么？
What did you say your name was?

149
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:44,042
吉尔・汤尔
Jill Tanner.

150
00:11:45,618 --> 00:11:48,086
严格地说，我想我是本森夫人
Technically, I guess I'm Mrs. Benson.

151
00:11:48,888 --> 00:11:51,049
我16岁的时候，结过一次婚
I was married once, when I was 16.

152
00:11:51,124 --> 00:11:52,216
16？
Sixteen?

153
00:11:52,558 --> 00:11:54,287
你的婚姻维持了多长时间？
How long were you married?

154
00:11:56,062 --> 00:11:57,586
好像只有几周
It seemed like weeks.

155
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:03,262
实际上，只有6天
Actually, it was six days.

156
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,301
他怎么样？
What was he like?

157
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:13,273
对不起。我真的不想谈起他
I'm sorry. I really don't want to talk about it.

158
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,670
那就别说了，我很抱歉这么问
Then, don't. I'm sorry I asked.

159
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:20,046
不，我要谈谈他。偶尔也该做点……
No, I'll talk about him. Once in a while you should do something...

160
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:22,917
……不想做的事情。可以清理心绪
...you don't want to do. It cleanses the insides.

161
00:12:27,193 --> 00:12:29,058
杰克看上去很粗野
Jack was wild-looking.

162
00:12:30,263 --> 00:12:31,730
有几分青少年的模样
Sort of adolescent.

163
00:12:32,331 --> 00:12:34,731
女孩总是比男孩成熟得更快一些，对吗？
Girls mature faster than boys, don't they?

164
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:39,170
不管怎样，我们相遇，就好像烈火，火箭
Anyway, we met and it was like fireworks, rockets.

165
00:12:40,506 --> 00:12:42,599
每天都好像是国庆日
Every day was like Fourth of July.

166
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:47,077
然后，我们站在地方治安法官面前……
Then, we were standing before the justice of the peace...

167
00:12:47,146 --> 00:12:48,511
……结婚了
...getting married.

168
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:52,278
在此之前你认识他多久了？
我不知道，2或3周吧
-How long had you known him?
-I don't know, two or three weeks.

169
00:12:53,219 --> 00:12:57,485
但是我们结婚的时候，我甚至高中还没有毕业
But there we were, getting married. And I wasn't even out of high school yet.

170
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,148
而且我惦念着第二天我还有两场测验
And I had two exams the next day, and they were on my mind, too.

171
00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:05,153
接着，我听到地方治安法官说：
Then, I heard the justice of the peace say:

172
00:13:05,398 --> 00:13:08,925
“杰克，你愿娶吉尔作为你唯一合法的妻子吗？”
"Do you, Jack, take Jill to be your lawfully wedded wife?"

173
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:14,063
你能想象作为杰克和吉尔而度过一生的情景吗？
Can you imagine going through life as Jack and Jill?

174
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,770
接着，我听他回答说：
And then, I heard him say:

175
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:18,840
“直到死亡将我们分离”
"Till death do us part."

176
00:13:20,813 --> 00:13:24,271
突然间，我感到这更像是一场葬礼，而不是结婚典礼
Suddenly, it became more like a funeral service then a wedding ceremony.

177
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,682
天！
太变态了
-Jesus!
-It was so morbid.

178
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:28,782
我憎恨任何病态的事情
I hate anything morbid.

179
00:13:28,855 --> 00:13:31,483
为什么你不试图维持你的婚姻呢？
Why didn't you try to make your marriage work?

180
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:32,524
我做了
I did.

181
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:36,423
我试着维持了6天
I did. I tried for six days.

182
00:13:36,963 --> 00:13:40,160
但我知道这是一个错误
那你是否爱上他了呢？
-But I knew it was a mistake.
-Were you in love with him?

183
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:42,426
是的，用我自己的方式
你的方式是什么？
-In my way.
-What's your way?

184
00:13:42,735 --> 00:13:43,861
我不知道
I don't know.

185
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:46,962
不能仅仅因为你爱某人，就意味着……
Just because you love someone doesn't necessarily mean...

186
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,008
……你想要花费你的余生跟他们在一起
...you want to spend the rest of your life with them.

187
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:52,109
杰克爱我
And Jack loved me.

188
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:55,803
我意思是，他真的爱我
I mean, he really loved me.

189
00:13:56,516 --> 00:14:00,316
而我伤害了他。那就是为什么我不能呆下去的原因
And I hurt him. That's just what I can't stand.

190
00:14:00,586 --> 00:14:02,713
我只是从来不想伤害什么人
I just never want to hurt anybody.

191
00:14:03,923 --> 00:14:06,084
婚姻就是一种承诺，不是吗？
Marriage is a commitment, isn't it?

192
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:08,717
而我就是不能遵守承诺或者与人关系亲密
And I just can't be committed or involved.

193
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:10,425
你能明白吗？
Can you understand?

194
00:14:11,164 --> 00:14:13,655
是的，我明白，但我不赞同
Yeah, I can understand, but I don't agree.

195
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:16,232
好吧，那么你并没有真正明白
Well, then, you really don't understand.

196
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,267
我想我是个邋遢的人
I thought I was sloppy.

197
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:24,273
什么意思？
What do you mean?

198
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:27,642
除非你知道有些事情我是不知道的，比如烟灰对桌子有好处
Unless you know something I don't, like ashes are good for the table.

199
00:14:27,713 --> 00:14:30,238
所以你都把烟灰弹在桌上？
Is that why you keep dropping them on there?

200
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,111
你移动了烟灰缸的位置？
Did you move the ashtray?

201
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:35,621
它就在这边，难道你瞎了吗？
是的
-It's right here. What, are you blind?
-Yes.

202
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:41,889
你说“是的”是什么意思？
我意思是，我是个盲人
-What do you mean, "Yes"?
-I mean, yes, I'm blind.

203
00:14:48,434 --> 00:14:51,597
哦，你在开玩笑，别这样
Oh, you're putting me on. Don't do that.

204
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:54,537
不，我是盲人。一直是
No, I'm blind. I've always been blind.

205
00:14:59,512 --> 00:15:01,070
你意思是，真的瞎了？
You mean, really blind?

206
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:03,305
不是近视？
Not just nearsighted?

207
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,608
我看不见任何东西
The works. I can't see a thing.

208
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:32,575
哦，天！我希望我没说那些话
Oh, God! I hope I didn't say anything.

209
00:15:32,678 --> 00:15:35,511
等一等，别觉得不自在，我没关系
Wait a minute. Don't get self-conscious about it. I'm not.

210
00:15:35,581 --> 00:15:37,742
你为什么不告诉我？
不是刚刚说了吗？
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I just did.

211
00:15:37,817 --> 00:15:40,377
我的意思是，我刚进门的时候就说
你没问
-But I mean, when I came in.
-You didn't ask me.

212
00:15:40,453 --> 00:15:41,715
为什么我会问你？
Why would I ask you?

213
00:15:41,787 --> 00:15:43,721
我不会走到某人家里，问：
I don't walk into somebody's house, saying:

214
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:45,950
“嗨，我是吉尔・汤尔，你是盲人吗？”
"Hi, I'm Jill Tanner. Are you blind?"

215
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:48,994
我也不会逢人就说“我是唐・贝克，跟蝙蝠一样的瞎子”
I don't meet someone and say, "Don Baker. Blind as a bat."

216
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:52,462
我仍然认为你应该告诉我。如果是我，我会告诉你的
I still think you should've told me. I would've told you.

217
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:54,759
我想看看你会花多长时间发现我是个盲人
I wanted to see how long it'd take you to catch on.

218
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:56,062
哦，天！
Oh, God!

219
00:15:56,936 --> 00:15:59,871
当我看见你一直站在窗户前
When I saw you standing at the window all that time.

220
00:16:00,072 --> 00:16:02,199
那样要比在房间里凉快很多
It's the coolest spot in the room.

221
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:06,036
我以为你是个偷窥狂
I thought you were a peeping Tom.

222
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,070
我把这称之为积极的想法
That's what I call positive thinking.

223
00:16:09,148 --> 00:16:12,049
我几乎都要报警了。也许我会呢？
You know, I nearIy called the police. Suppose I had?

224
00:16:12,585 --> 00:16:14,712
呃，他们不会把你关起来
Well, they would've locked you up.

225
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:21,853
你真了不起，整形的真好
You're so cool. So adjusted.

226
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:25,330
不，我没有，我不需要整形。我天生就是个盲人
No, I'm not. I never had to adjust. I was born blind.

227
00:16:25,398 --> 00:16:28,094
如果我原先看得见，后来失明了，会不一样的
It'd be different if I'd been able to see then went blind.

228
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,964
对于我，失明是正常的
For me, blindness is normal.

229
00:16:30,036 --> 00:16:32,766
我6岁的时候才发现其他人都不是盲人
I was 6 before I found out everybody else wasn't blind.

230
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:36,672
这并没有什么不同。所以放松点，好吗？
By then it didn't make any difference. So, let's relax, okay?

231
00:16:36,742 --> 00:16:39,768
你知道，如果我们对此能有点笑声会更好
You know, if we can have a few laughs, so much the better.

232
00:16:39,979 --> 00:16:41,446
一点笑声？
A few laughs?

233
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:44,140
对于失明这件事吗？
About blindness?

234
00:16:44,817 --> 00:16:47,081
不，不是关于失明
No, not about blindness.

235
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:49,579
你不能忘记这个吗？
Can't you forget that?

236
00:16:50,122 --> 00:16:52,920
你是我遇到的第一个盲人
Well, you're the first blind person I ever met.

237
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:55,988
太糟了，他们不会为此发奖给你的
Too bad they don't give out prizes for that.

238
00:16:56,062 --> 00:16:59,327
我在街上看见过盲人，他们都带着狗……
I've seen blind men on the street, and everything, with dogs...

239
00:16:59,398 --> 00:17:01,525
……但是，你为什么没有一条狗呢？
...but why don't you have a dog?

240
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:04,668
它们太引人注目了，我宁可靠自己
They attract too much attention. I'd rather do it myself.

241
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:07,797
你在旧金山就没有遇到过麻烦吗？
Don't you have trouble getting around San Francisco?

242
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:11,707
我的意思是，连我都觉得麻烦
不，我用盲杖很得心应手
-I mean, it's tough for me.
-No, I manage very well with my cane.

243
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:16,109
我精确地知道去洗衣房，药房和熟食店分别需要几步
I know exactly how many steps to the laundry, drugstore, and delicatessen.

244
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,248
洗衣房在哪里？我正好需要
Where's the laundry? I need one.

245
00:17:19,385 --> 00:17:20,909
就在熟食店附近
Near the delicatessen.

246
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:23,853
出去，从前门右转走44步
Outside, turn right, and it's 44 steps from the front door.

247
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:25,948
我没看到
我指给你看
-I didn't see it.
-I'll show you.

248
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:28,492
你指给我看……
You'll show....

249
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:31,387
哇！
Wow!

250
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:35,827
那在你的公寓里面难道不会撞到东西？
What about your apartment? Don't you bang into things?

251
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:38,836
你会伤到自己
不会，我记住了房间的位置
-You could hurt yourself.
-No, I memorized the room.

252
00:17:39,338 --> 00:17:41,829
床，吉他
Bed. Guitar.

253
00:17:43,843 --> 00:17:45,276
浴室
Bathroom.

254
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:51,983
夹克，我的盲杖，前门
Jacket. My cane. Front door.

255
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:54,508
书架
Bookcase.

256
00:17:55,154 --> 00:17:57,679
葡萄酒，酒杯，五斗柜
Wine, glasses, chest of drawers.

257
00:17:58,224 --> 00:17:59,953
桌布
这些是什么书？
-Linens.
-What are these books?

258
00:18:00,025 --> 00:18:04,587
盲文，餐桌
Braille. Dining table.

259
00:18:05,064 --> 00:18:06,224
浴缸
Bathtub.

260
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:10,428
厨房
Kitchen.

261
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:17,540
番茄酱，油，盐，胡椒粉，糖，咖啡
Ketchup. Oil. Salt. Pepper. Sugar. Coffee.

262
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:20,340
天！
现在，如果你把烟灰缸放回原处
-Gee!
-Now, if you'll just put the ashtray back.

263
00:18:27,286 --> 00:18:28,253
你瞧！
Voila!

264
00:18:28,487 --> 00:18:31,615
你越是不移动物品，我越能像其他人一样做的好
As long as you don't move anything I'm as good as anybody else.

265
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:36,127
甚至更好，在我的住处我找不到任何东西
Better. I can't find anything in my place.

266
00:18:36,595 --> 00:18:39,063
如果你真的想知道什么叫个混乱，看看我那儿就……
If you really want to see chaos, come look at....

267
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:40,621
哦，对不起
Oh, I'm sorry.

268
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:45,501
我是说……
我知道你的意思
-I meant....
-I know what you mean.

269
00:18:45,704 --> 00:18:48,639
除了我看不见之外，我跟其他人没有任何区别
I'm no different from anybody else, except I don't see.

270
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:52,006
失明不会比其他人的反应更能困扰我
The blindness doesn't bother me as much as other people's reaction.

271
00:18:52,077 --> 00:18:54,102
如果他们只是表现地自然一些
If they'd only behave naturally.

272
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,441
一些人假装内疚，
Some people assume guilt, which they can't...

273
00:18:56,515 --> 00:18:59,143
因为我的母亲有市场地位
...because my mother has that market cornered.

274
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:00,808
所以，像你往常那样就好
So, just be yourself.

275
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,212
好吧，我总是以为失明的人有点……
Well, I always thought that blind people were...

276
00:19:05,224 --> 00:19:07,317
……你知道，有点吓人
...you know, kind of spooky.

277
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:10,489
那是自然
But of course.

278
00:19:11,096 --> 00:19:14,293
我们整天都倒挂在树干上睡觉
We sleep all day hanging upside-down from the shower rod.

279
00:19:14,366 --> 00:19:17,301
当天黑以后，我们醒来，飞进人们的窗户
When it's dark we wake up and fly in through people's windows.

280
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:19,360
那就是为什么人们说，像蝙蝠一样瞎
That's why they say, "Blind as a bat."

281
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:21,963
不，我是认真的。现在严肃一点
No, I'm serious. Now be serious.

282
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:25,339
难道失明的人没有第六感吗？
Don't blind people have a sixth sense?

283
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:28,572
不，如果我有第六感，加起来也只有五种感官，不是么？
No. If I had six senses, I'd still only have five, wouldn't I?

284
00:19:28,647 --> 00:19:31,013
我的其它感官，听觉，味觉和触觉
And my other senses, hearing, taste and touch...

285
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,951
也许比你更发达些，因为我更常利用它们
...might be a little more developed than yours because I use them more.

286
00:19:35,187 --> 00:19:36,882
我给你演示一下
I'll show you something.

287
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:39,254
把我转几圈
Spin me around.

288
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:45,487
不，我的意思是真的转我几圈
No, I mean really spin me.

289
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,839
在我前面有什么东西
窗户
-There's something in front of me.
-The window.

290
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:02,177
太神了，你怎么做到的？
That's wild. How'd you do that?

291
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:05,181
这叫影子视觉
什么是影子视觉
-It's called shadow vision.
-What's shadow vision?

292
00:20:05,584 --> 00:20:08,883
就是能够感觉到前方有物体
It's being able to sense that there's a solid object in front of you.

293
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:12,481
你也能做到。这是人体自身的警告，非盲人也能做到
You can feel it. It's a warning. Sighted people can do it, too...

294
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:15,391
但是盲人能做的更好一点
我想试试
-...but blind people can do it better.
-I want to try it.

295
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:25,868
哎呀！我的
Ouch! My....

296
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:29,701
这是盲人的优势
There are advantages to being blind.

297
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:33,811
哦，我想你不是那么痛苦真好
Oh, I think it's so great you're not bitter.

298
00:20:34,547 --> 00:20:36,981
你看上去一点也不痛苦
You don't seem to have any bitterness at all.

299
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:39,847
我知道如果我是盲人，我一定会非常痛苦
I know I'd be terribly bitter if I couldn't see.

300
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:42,520
我知道我会变得令人讨厌
我看不一定
-I know I'd be disagreeable.
-I doubt it.

301
00:20:42,821 --> 00:20:46,154
哦，不，我不会像你这样乐观
Oh, no. I couldn't be cheerful like you.

302
00:20:46,392 --> 00:20:50,556
我丝毫没有勇气和刚毅之类的非凡品质
I don't have any of those marvelous qualities like courage and fortitude.

303
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:53,659
我也没有。我只是天生惹人喜爱
Well, neither do I. I'm just naturally adorable.

304
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:55,730
你远不止可爱
You're a lot more than that.

305
00:20:56,435 --> 00:20:58,369
你是个非常优秀的人
You're a very superior person.

306
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:00,799
哦，是，我是了不起的
Oh, yeah. I'm fantastic.

307
00:21:01,307 --> 00:21:04,242
“我不会温和地走进那个良夜”
"I would not go gentle into that good night"

308
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:08,344
“我会怒斥光的消逝”
"I would rage against the dying of the light"

309
00:21:09,448 --> 00:21:10,676
迪伦・托马斯
Dylan Thomas.

310
00:21:11,016 --> 00:21:13,712
谁？
这是迪伦・托马斯的诗
-Who?
-It's a line from a poem by Dylan Thomas.

311
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:15,179
是吗？
It is?

312
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:18,048
你是说我能引用迪伦・托马斯的诗句？
You mean I can quote Dylan Thomas?

313
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,687
他的诗怎么样？我甚至还没读过
How about that? I never even read him.

314
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:25,462
我不记得在哪里学过了。我能引用马克・吐温的名言
I don't know where I learned it. I can quote Mark Twain.

315
00:21:25,898 --> 00:21:28,366
我特别喜欢引用马克・吐温的作品
My favorite quotation is by Mark Twain.

316
00:21:28,434 --> 00:21:30,231
你想听听吗？
好
-You want to hear it?
-Go.

317
00:21:33,472 --> 00:21:35,372
“我只要求自由。”
"I only ask to be free."

318
00:21:36,408 --> 00:21:38,399
“蝴蝶是自由的”
"The butterflies are free."

319
00:21:38,978 --> 00:21:42,414
“人类想必不会否认哈罗德・斯金坡尔……”
"Mankind will surely not deny to Harold Skimpole..."

320
00:21:42,982 --> 00:21:45,314
“……让步蝴蝶的行为”
"...what it concedes to the butterflies."

321
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,081
我与蝴蝶有一种强烈的感觉，你喜欢吗？
I identify strongly with butterflies. Do you like it?

322
00:21:52,157 --> 00:21:55,285
是的，非常喜欢。只是这不是马克・吐温写的
Yes, very much, except it wasn't written by Mark Twain.

323
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:58,155
为什么不是？
这是狄更斯写的
-Why not?
-It was written by Dickens.

324
00:21:58,263 --> 00:21:59,525
你确信？
是
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

325
00:21:59,598 --> 00:22:02,863
哈罗德・斯金坡尔是狄更斯写的小说《荒凉山庄》中的一个角色
Harold Skimpole is a character in <i>Bleak House</i> by Dickens.

326
00:22:02,968 --> 00:22:05,493
哦，我没有读过狄更斯的作品
Oh, I never read Dickens.

327
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:11,008
实际上，我也没读过马克・吐温的作品，但我总以为那个是他写的
Actually, I never read Mark Twain either, but I always thought he wrote that.

328
00:22:11,877 --> 00:22:16,007
你是否读过……，噢！天！
Have you read.... Oh, God!

329
00:22:16,081 --> 00:22:18,777
我读过狄更斯的书，还有马克・吐温的大多数作品
I have read Dickens and I've read most of Mark Twain...

330
00:22:18,851 --> 00:22:22,287
……请不要再斤斤计较每一个词。这些书都有盲文版的
...and stop falling apart at every word. They're published in Braille.

331
00:22:22,354 --> 00:22:25,414
问一个盲人是否读过什么真是太糟糕了
It's awful to ask someone who's blind if he's read something.

332
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:26,617
一点也不
Not at all.

333
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:29,293
实际上，我用我的指尖阅读的很好
Actually, I read very well with my fingertips.

334
00:22:29,361 --> 00:22:32,057
只要问问我近来是否读过什么好书
Just ask me if I've felt any good books lately.

335
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:35,826
有人为你读过什么吗？
有，杂志和报纸
-Does anybody ever read to you?
-Yeah, magazines and newspapers.

336
00:22:36,935 --> 00:22:40,063
什么时候我能为你读？
只要你愿意
-Could I read to you sometime?
-If you feel like it.

337
00:22:40,906 --> 00:22:45,639
你喜欢什么杂志？
《时代》、《新闻周刊》、《伯克利芒刺报》（最有名最成功的校园地下报纸）
-What kind of magazines do you like?
-<i>Time</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, <i>Berkeley Barb</i>.

338
00:22:46,311 --> 00:22:48,245
我喜欢知道社会的变化
I like to know what's going on.

339
00:22:48,313 --> 00:22:51,373
我也读这些报刊，但我从不知道社会的走向
I should read those, too. I never know what's going on.

340
00:22:51,617 --> 00:22:54,450
我猜你没有认真读
好了，别谈这个了
-I guess I don't really care.
-Now, don't say that.

341
00:22:54,787 --> 00:22:57,153
我的意思是，动物保护，植物灭绝。
I mean, animals care, vegetables don't.

342
00:22:57,356 --> 00:23:00,223
除非你一无所有，否则你总有点什么事情是需要关心的
You have to care about something or you're nothing.

343
00:23:00,526 --> 00:23:01,618
吃的
Food.

344
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:04,625
吃的？
我非常在乎吃的
-Food?
-I care about it deeply.

345
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,956
我常常饿
I'm hungry.

346
00:23:06,131 --> 00:23:08,895
关于自由呢？你不关心自由问题吗？
How about freedom? You care about being free, don't you?

347
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:13,427
在我吃饱以后，自由就是世界上最重要的事情
Freedom is the most important thing in the world to me, after I've eaten.

348
00:23:14,306 --> 00:23:16,297
你请随意
谢谢
-Help yourself.
-Okay. Thanks.

349
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:19,409
我的食欲很困扰我
My appetite embarrasses me.

350
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:23,375
你不得不知道许多需要关心的事情
You have to know a lot about things to care about them.

351
00:23:23,449 --> 00:23:27,681
我懂的事情不太多
你不太喜欢你自己，是吗？
-I don't know much about anything.
-You don't like yourself very much, do you?

352
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:29,048
你为什么这样说？
Why do you say that?

353
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:31,646
因为你总是把自己看得很低
Because you're always putting yourself down.

354
00:23:31,824 --> 00:23:33,849
我们叫它“有自知之明”
Let's say I know my limitations.

355
00:23:35,294 --> 00:23:38,627
比起你给自己的评价，你有更多的潜能
You have a lot more potential than you give yourself credit for.

356
00:23:38,697 --> 00:23:41,825
那请你告诉我有哪些潜能
不，由你告诉你自己
-Just keep telling me that.
-No, just keep telling yourself that.

357
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:50,307
"I knew the day you met me I could

358
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:52,775
"love you if you let me

359
00:23:52,845 --> 00:23:55,575
"though you touched my cheek and said

360
00:23:55,647 --> 00:24:00,175
"how easy you'd forget me, you said

361
00:24:02,554 --> 00:24:05,751
"Butterflies are free

362
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,896
"and so are we"

363
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,698
真棒！
That's wild!

364
00:24:15,768 --> 00:24:17,531
这就是那首你整天唱的歌
That's the song you sing all the time.

365
00:24:17,603 --> 00:24:18,968
好听吗？
我很喜欢
-You like it?
-I love it.

366
00:24:19,037 --> 00:24:20,061
我写的
I wrote it.

367
00:24:20,139 --> 00:24:24,906
我虽然从来不能准确地记住上次听过的歌词，但是我喜欢关于蝴蝶的东西
I could never get those last lines right, but I really like that thing about butterflies.

368
00:24:25,277 --> 00:24:28,178
“蝴蝶是自由的
"Butterflies are free

369
00:24:33,252 --> 00:24:35,152
”所以我们也是“
"and so are we"

370
00:24:45,998 --> 00:24:47,795
哦，那出色了
Oh, that's fantastic.

371
00:24:48,634 --> 00:24:52,161
我知道一点音乐，我在学校学过一些
I know a little bit about music. I studied it in school.

372
00:24:52,471 --> 00:24:56,032
你有完成学业吗？
我只完成了高中学业
-Did you finish school?
-I finished high school. Just.

373
00:24:57,509 --> 00:24:59,670
我的母亲希望我去上大学
My mother wanted me to go to college.

374
00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:03,442
我曾经打算去加州大学洛杉矶分校，但我找不到停车的位置
I was going to go to UCLA, but I couldn't find a place to park.

375
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:08,610
你应该去灌制唱片
我正等着被人发掘
-You ought to make a record, an album.
-Well, I'm waiting to be discovered.

376
00:25:08,921 --> 00:25:12,982
好吧，在你被发掘之后，当你去某地表演的时候……
Well, after you get discovered, when you're playing somewhere...

377
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:16,053
……你就打算穿成这样去吗？
...are you going to dress like this?

378
00:25:17,162 --> 00:25:20,598
我还从来没有认真考虑过这个。我的衣着有什么问题吗？
I'd never really thought about it. Something's wrong with my clothes?

379
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:22,998
它们看起来像是你母亲买的
They look as though your mother bought them.

380
00:25:23,068 --> 00:25:24,558
这么糟？
That bad?

381
00:25:24,903 --> 00:25:28,100
好吧，我猜它取决于你在哪里表演
Well, I guess it depends on where you're playing.

382
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:31,233
我的意思是，如果你打算在银行表演，这套服装就很合适
I mean, they're fine if you're going to play in a bank.

383
00:25:32,044 --> 00:25:34,569
你应该穿着更加开放一点
You ought to wear something a little more liberated.

384
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:36,580
我的衣服的确是我母亲买的
My mother does buy my clothes.

385
00:25:36,648 --> 00:25:39,811
我很乐意去为你挑选一些真正野性的东西
I'd love to pick out something really wild for you.

386
00:25:39,885 --> 00:25:42,513
什么时候？
我不知道。你愿意什么时候？
-Like when?
-I don't know. Whenever you like.

387
00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:44,055
现在就去怎么样？
现在？
-How about now?
-Right now?

388
00:25:44,122 --> 00:25:45,453
是
好
-Yeah.
-Okay.

389
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:47,855
我正无事可做。来吧
I don't have anything to do. Come on.

390
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,694
你不带上盲杖吗？
我牵着你的胳膊去
-Won't you take your cane?
-I'm going to take your arm.

391
00:25:57,769 --> 00:25:59,896
你看得见路，不是吗？
哦，是
-You can see, can't you?
-Oh, yeah.

392
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:02,999
在这里等一下，我去拿我的包
Wait right there. I got to get my bag.

393
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:25,695
小心
Be careful.

394
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:43,880
44步，嘿，你是对的。44步就到了洗衣店
Forty-four. Hey, you're right. It's 44 steps to the laundry.

395
00:26:44,116 --> 00:26:45,549
你来这里的干什么？
What made you come here?

396
00:26:45,617 --> 00:26:47,744
我想试试不同的事物
I wanted to try something different.

397
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:50,754
你觉得你会呆下来吗？
我还没认真考虑过这个问题
-Do you think you'll stay?
-I don't really think about it.

398
00:26:50,822 --> 00:26:53,950
我会看看事情发展的如何。我要做一个演员
I'll see how it goes. I may be an actress.

399
00:26:54,293 --> 00:26:56,261
我是说，”我将要“，明天就能知道结果了
I say, "I may." I'll know tomorrow.

400
00:26:56,328 --> 00:26:59,661
我在一家名叫宇宙工厂的剧院组织里……
I'm auditioning for a part in a new play with a theater group...

401
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:01,665
……应聘了一出新戏的角色
...called the Cosmic Workshop.

402
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:05,336
这出戏讲的是一个女孩，当她嫁给一个同性恋时，将所有的事情都中断
It's about a girl who gets all hung-up when she marries a homosexual.

403
00:27:05,404 --> 00:27:07,167
起初，他是一个酒鬼……
Originally, he was an alcoholic...

404
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:10,037
……但是同性恋现在在电影、书籍和戏剧中里很流行……
...but homosexuals are very in now in movies...

405
00:27:10,108 --> 00:27:12,633
……所以他们改了剧本
...and books and plays, so they changed it.

406
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:16,070
你是同性恋吗？
Are you homosexual?

407
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:17,812
不是，只是一个盲人
No, just blind.

408
00:27:19,584 --> 00:27:22,451
小心，有台阶
向上还是向下？
-Careful, there's a step.
-Up or down?

409
00:27:23,021 --> 00:27:23,680
向下！
Down!

410
00:27:25,357 --> 00:27:27,291
我的一个最好的朋友是男同性恋
One of my best friends is gay.

411
00:27:27,426 --> 00:27:29,394
丹尼斯，他是个设计师
Dennis. He's a designer.

412
00:27:29,695 --> 00:27:32,255
他人也很好，他为我做了这件衬衣
He's good, too. He made this blouse for me.

413
00:27:32,531 --> 00:27:34,260
我相信衣服一定非常漂亮
I'm sure it's very pretty.

414
00:27:36,835 --> 00:27:40,566
实际上，他是给自己做的。但我劝他不要穿
Actually, he made it for himself, but I talked him out of it.

415
00:27:41,073 --> 00:27:43,541
丹尼斯非常扭捏，也非常风趣
Dennis is so campy and funny.

416
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,873
但是我不喜欢女同性恋。她们太一本正经和沉闷了
But I don't like lesbians. They're so heavy and humorless.

417
00:27:49,715 --> 00:27:52,377
戏的导演是我的朋友。她觉得我能够胜任这个角色
The director is my friend. He thinks I can do the part.

418
00:27:52,451 --> 00:27:55,386
我只需要被编剧认可就行了
谁是导演？
-I just have to be approved by the author.
-Who's the director?

419
00:27:55,454 --> 00:27:58,184
你不会听说过的。她的名字叫拉尔夫・桑多
You wouldn't know him. His name is Ralph Santori.

420
00:27:58,256 --> 00:28:01,453
他来自洛杉矶。他在那儿的许多小剧场做过……
He's from L.A. He's done a lot of little theater there...

421
00:28:01,526 --> 00:28:03,221
……但从来没成功过……
...but never had a hit...

422
00:28:03,295 --> 00:28:06,856
……所以他来了这里，因为他从宇宙工厂签了一份工作
...so he came up here because he got a job with the Cosmic Workshop.

423
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,626
我们某种程度上在一起了一段时间，但后来他想要结婚……
We kind of made it together for a while, but then he wanted to get married...

424
00:28:11,703 --> 00:28:14,069
……而我又无法正视这种情况
...and I just couldn't face that again.

425
00:28:14,373 --> 00:28:15,863
那么你爱他吗？
Were you in love with him?

426
00:28:15,941 --> 00:28:19,240
我没认真想过我会爱上什么人
I don't really think I've ever been in love with anybody.

427
00:28:19,678 --> 00:28:23,876
我不想这样。太受拘束了。一些人总会受伤
I don't want to be. It's too confining. Somebody always gets hurt.

428
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:27,481
嘿，让我们去这家，他们有一些粗野的衣服
Hey, let's go in here. They've got wild things.

429
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:29,377
有台阶
上还是下？
-There are steps.
-Up or down?

430
00:28:29,454 --> 00:28:32,184
上，我不能面面俱到
Up. I can't think of everything.

431
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:43,461
你好
Hi.

432
00:28:43,735 --> 00:28:46,863
想要点什么？
不，谢谢，只是随便看看
-You need any help?
-No, thanks, we're just looking.

433
00:28:56,982 --> 00:28:58,279
这个怎么样？
How about this?

434
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:03,012
不，不是给你的，是给丹尼斯的
感觉还行
-No, that's not for you, that's for Dennis.
-Well, it feels nice.

435
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:05,548
我要买下来
我买下送你吧
-I'll buy it.
-I'll buy it for you.

436
00:29:05,624 --> 00:29:08,320
不
请让我买给你吧
-No.
-Please, let me buy it for you.

437
00:29:08,393 --> 00:29:10,418
不
我确实想给你买下
-No.
-I really want to buy it for you.

438
00:29:10,495 --> 00:29:12,463
好吧好吧
Okay. Okay.

439
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:16,195
这里，拿着
Here, hold this up.

440
00:29:17,903 --> 00:29:19,370
还不坏
Yeah, it's not bad.

441
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:22,165
我们能比“不坏”更好一点吗？
Can't we do better than "not bad"?

442
00:29:22,274 --> 00:29:23,468
行，等着
Okay, wait.

443
00:29:30,382 --> 00:29:31,849
试试这个
Yeah. Try that on.

444
00:29:36,855 --> 00:29:38,652
你能也拿着我的衬衫
You can take my shirt, too.

445
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:42,226
找到想要的吗？
Found anything yet?

446
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,828
唐，这位是芦笋先生
你好
-Don, this is Mr. Asparagus.
-Hi.

447
00:29:44,896 --> 00:29:48,525
不，我的名字是罗伊・斯特拉顿。这家店的名字叫芦笋
No, my name is Roy Stratton. The shop is called Asparagus.

448
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,736
我这样叫是因为我总是以为芦笋是最友好的蔬菜
I named it that 'cause I always think of asparagus as being a friendly vegetable.

449
00:29:52,804 --> 00:29:57,468
我的意思是，你可以看见一个土豆，或者一个洋葱，或者一个玉米……
I mean, you might see one potato, or one onion, or one corn...

450
00:29:57,876 --> 00:29:59,969
……但你从没看见一根芦笋
...but you never see one asparagus.

451
00:30:00,045 --> 00:30:04,573
他们总是成捆出售，他们关系亲密
你从没见过一粒豌豆
-They come in bunches. They're involved.
-You never see one pea.

452
00:30:06,451 --> 00:30:08,146
好吧，我不喜欢豌豆
Well, I don't like peas.

453
00:30:08,887 --> 00:30:11,583
嘿，这件马甲上去跟衬衫很搭
Hey, this vest will look great with it.

454
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:14,789
拿着，试试看
好
-Here, try it on.
-Yeah.

455
00:30:14,893 --> 00:30:16,520
另一只胳膊伸过来
Give me your other arm.

456
00:30:16,995 --> 00:30:17,859
好的
Okay.

457
00:30:20,432 --> 00:30:22,832
很好，混搭在一起。我喜欢
Yeah, now, that's together. I like that.

458
00:30:23,635 --> 00:30:25,330
很不错
我喜欢
-Sweet.
-I love it.

459
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,563
看上去像不像唱片封面？
像
-Does it look like an album cover?
-Yeah.

460
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:30,437
嘿，你还需要一顶帽子。帽子现在很重要
Hey, but what you need is a hat. Hats are big now.

461
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:33,405
什么样的帽子？
你要什么，宝贝，我们有各种各样的帽子
-What kind of hat?
-Say, baby, we got everything here.

462
00:30:33,478 --> 00:30:34,604
都在这里
Over here.

463
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,914
棒球联盟的帽子怎么样？我们卖了许多这种帽子
How about a Confederate cap? We sell a lot of these.

464
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,890
是啊，我看到了很多
Yeah, I've seen a lot of them.

465
00:30:47,592 --> 00:30:49,082
我喜欢这个
Now, I like this one.

466
00:30:49,561 --> 00:30:50,960
你觉得怎么样？
What do you think?

467
00:30:51,363 --> 00:30:52,887
不，我觉得不好
No, I don't think so.

468
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:56,394
等一下
Oh, just a minute.

469
00:30:56,701 --> 00:30:58,328
嘿，这顶怎样？
Hey, how about this?

470
00:30:58,537 --> 00:31:01,199
一顶提洛尔人帽子
提洛尔人帽？
-A Tyrolean hat.
-A Tyrolean hat?

471
00:31:01,273 --> 00:31:03,366
好吧
看上去还不错
-Well.
-Yeah, that looks good.

472
00:31:04,543 --> 00:31:07,034
我喜欢，你自己看看
I like that. Take a look at yourself.

473
00:31:11,082 --> 00:31:15,314
你怎么想？
不，谢谢，让我像海蒂（一部电影主角）
-What do you think?
-No. It makes me look like Heidi.

474
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:20,780
我知道适合你的帽子了。现在，很相似的一顶，如果我能找到。
I got just the thing for you. Now, it's one of a kind, if I can find it.

475
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,556
在这里。怎么样？
Here it is. How about that?

476
00:31:25,597 --> 00:31:28,691
这是什么？
这是一顶法国海外雇佣军的帽子
-What is it?
-It's a cap from the French Foreign Legion.

477
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:30,098
我喜欢
I love it.

478
00:31:34,706 --> 00:31:37,675
太合适了。伙计，你就是生来适合这顶帽子的
Perfect fit. Man, you were born with that hat on.

479
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:39,709
嘿，你自己瞧瞧看
Hey, take a look at yourself.

480
00:31:42,113 --> 00:31:43,341
镜子在这
In the mirror.

481
00:31:49,387 --> 00:31:52,618
嘿，他是不是……
是的，他是，别再窃窃私语了
-Hey, is he--
-Yes, he is. And stop whispering.

482
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,323
我很抱歉，我不知道……
为什么，伙计？又不是你的错
-Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't--
-Why, man? It's not your fault.

483
00:31:58,396 --> 00:32:00,887
别因为这个而不自在，我们没什么
Don't make a big thing out of it. We don't.

484
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:03,628
这顶帽子多少钱？
这是免费的，算是纪念品
-How much is the hat?
-It's on the house. A souvenir.

485
00:32:03,702 --> 00:32:06,535
一共多少钱？衬衫，马甲，还有吉尔的上衣？
How much is it? And the shirt, the vest, and Jill's blouse?

486
00:32:06,605 --> 00:32:10,405
嘿，这里有《伯克利芒刺报》，我们也要一份
Hey, they've got the <i>Berkeley Barb</i>. We'll take one of these, too.

487
00:32:11,743 --> 00:32:13,472
你有没有色情书刊？
Do you have any dirty books?

488
00:32:13,545 --> 00:32:14,409
没有
No.

489
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,616
太糟了。那是唯一不用盲文出版的书
Too bad. That's the only thing they don't publish in Braille.

490
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:22,944
我猜盲人需求色情书刊是个想法
I guess it was the idea of someone blind asking for dirty books.

491
00:32:25,557 --> 00:32:28,253
你的意思是，如果我没有失明就好了？
You mean, it would've been all right if I were sighted?

492
00:32:28,326 --> 00:32:32,057
我不知道。不管怎么说你确实让他震惊了
I don't know. Anyway, you sure threw him into shock.

493
00:32:32,297 --> 00:32:34,492
你怎么样？
我？
-What about you?
-Me?

494
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:37,694
我自打认识你以来就很震惊了
I've been in shock since I met you.

495
00:32:39,104 --> 00:32:42,699
你觉得跟我出来时间足够长到今晚和我共进晚餐的地步了吗？
Could you come out of it long enough to have dinner with me tonight?

496
00:32:42,774 --> 00:32:44,901
晚餐，我会晕过去的
For dinner, I'd come out of a coma.

497
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,508
你确信跟我共进晚餐吗？有意大利腊肠，卷心菜和马铃薯沙拉
Are you sure we got enough for dinner? Salami, coleslaw and potato salad.

498
00:32:53,585 --> 00:32:54,950
都是我喜欢吃的
All my favorites.

499
00:32:56,288 --> 00:32:59,223
我能做点什么吗？
桌布在五斗橱里面
-Can I do something?
-Tablecloth in the chest of drawers.

500
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:01,919
你可以摆一下桌子
我们别在桌子上吃了
-You can set the table.
-Let's not eat at the table.

501
00:33:01,993 --> 00:33:05,292
意大利腊肠，马铃薯沙拉什么的，不是桌上食物
Salami and potato salad and stuff, that's not table food.

502
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,458
我们在地板上来个野餐吧
Let's eat on the floor and have a picnic.

503
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,367
我有个更好的主意
I got a better idea.

504
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:12,369
我们去海边
海边？
-Let's go to the beach.
-The beach?

505
00:33:12,437 --> 00:33:16,066
是，我知道有一小片沙滩，几乎很少人去的
Yeah, I know a little stretch of sand where hardly anybody ever goes.

506
00:33:16,141 --> 00:33:18,632
在哪里
就在餐桌的边上
-Where?
-Over there by the dining table.

507
00:33:19,477 --> 00:33:22,241
如果你是盲人你会看得更清楚
噢，真的？
-You can see better if you're blind.
-Oh, really?

508
00:33:22,314 --> 00:33:25,010
那你怎么会没有注意到潮水涨上来了呢？
Then how come you didn't notice the tide came in?

509
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:26,573
我看到了一个更好的地方
I see a much better place.

510
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:28,209
哪儿
床边
-Where?
-By the bed.

511
00:33:28,887 --> 00:33:30,354
太好了
Perfect.

512
00:33:38,997 --> 00:33:41,659
失明是遗传的吗？
我从没听说过
-Is blindness hereditary?
-I never heard that.

513
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,827
你的父亲视力好吗？
我不知道。他已经去世6年了
-Can your father see?
-I doubt it. He's been dead for six years.

514
00:33:45,904 --> 00:33:48,202
然而，直到那时他再也没有任何烦恼
Till then he didn't have any trouble, though.

515
00:33:48,273 --> 00:33:50,639
我打赌你很想念他
是的，确实很想念他
-I bet you miss him.
-Yeah, I do.

516
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:53,234
他是我成长过程中的唯一朋友
He was the only friend I had when I was growing up.

517
00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:54,778
我们非常亲密
We were very close.

518
00:33:54,979 --> 00:33:58,312
自从他死后，我的妈妈过的非常艰辛。因为她不得不……
It's been rough on Mom since he died because she's had to be both...

519
00:33:58,383 --> 00:34:01,284
……既当爹又当妈，同时还是姐妹和兄弟
...mother and father. And sister and brother.

520
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,249
还有医生，律师，众议员，女众议员
And doctor and lawyer, and congressman, congresswoman.

521
00:34:04,322 --> 00:34:05,812
拉比，神父，牧师
Rabbi, priest, padre.

522
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:08,415
哦，对不起。刀子你习惯放在左边还是右边？
Oh, I'm sorry. Do knives go on the left or the right?

523
00:34:08,493 --> 00:34:09,983
在右边
好的
-On the right.
-Okay.

524
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:15,494
你为什么出生就失明？医生有说过原因吗？
Why were you born blind? Did the doctor say why?

525
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:19,461
他们说是因为子宫内有病毒，也就是说他们不知道为什么
They said it was a virus in the womb, which means they don't know.

526
00:34:19,904 --> 00:34:23,465
你知道，我听说过患有梅毒的妇女会产下失明的婴儿
You know, I heard that women with syphilis give birth to blind babies.

527
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:25,736
你的母亲得过梅毒？
Could your mother have had syphilis?

528
00:34:29,681 --> 00:34:32,013
等你见到她，然后你再告诉我你的想法
You meet her, then tell me what you think.

529
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:33,744
那会是什么时候？
When will that be?

530
00:34:34,152 --> 00:34:35,278
一个月之内
In a month.

531
00:34:35,954 --> 00:34:38,980
在她来这儿察看事情进展情况之前我还有一个月的时间
I've got a month before she comes here to see what's going on.

532
00:34:39,057 --> 00:34:42,356
当一个月的时钟敲响的时候，他就会走进那扇门。
As the clock strikes month, she's going to walk in that door.

533
00:34:42,427 --> 00:34:44,793
你可能听说过她。她写过几本书
You may have heard of her. She wrote some books.

534
00:34:44,863 --> 00:34:46,694
她名叫弗洛伦斯・贝克
Her name's Florence Baker.

535
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:50,596
不，我没听说过。不过你不能凭我的知识来判断
No, it's not familiar, but you can't go by me.

536
00:34:50,802 --> 00:34:53,270
我即使引用了她的文章，我也不知道是她写的
I may even be quoting her and I wouldn't know it.

537
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:56,569
她写了一系列孩子的书。猜猜看书的内容是什么？
She wrote a series of children's books. Guess what they're about?

538
00:34:56,641 --> 00:34:58,006
关于孩子的？
Children?

539
00:34:58,076 --> 00:35:01,477
全是关于一个名叫小唐尼・达克的盲童的故事
They were all about a blind kid named Little Donnie Dark.

540
00:35:01,746 --> 00:35:04,112
小唐尼・达克？
就是我
-Little Donnie Dark?
-That's me.

541
00:35:04,182 --> 00:35:07,481
你骗人
没有，真的，我发誓
-You'll say anything to get attention.
-No, it's true, I swear.

542
00:35:07,552 --> 00:35:09,543
我讨厌这名字，唐尼
I hate that name, Donnie.

543
00:35:12,123 --> 00:35:14,023
我到达海滩时提醒我一下
Tell me when I hit the beach.

544
00:35:14,626 --> 00:35:16,116
停！
Stop!

545
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,062
这是我第一次在地板上吃饭
This is the first time I've eaten on the floor.

546
00:35:21,132 --> 00:35:22,622
这样做很实用
It's so practical.

547
00:35:23,468 --> 00:35:27,734
你可以用各种姿势坐着，要是你愿意，你甚至可以躺着
You can sit in so many different positions. You can even lie down, if you like.

548
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:29,934
桌子就过于局限了
Tables are so confining.

549
00:35:30,175 --> 00:35:31,506
就像爱情吗？
Like love?

550
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:36,111
是的。并且我也从不知道能用肘部干什么
Yes, and I never knew what to do with my elbows.

551
00:35:37,782 --> 00:35:39,306
还少了什么东西
Something is missing.

552
00:35:41,553 --> 00:35:42,520
我知道
I know.

553
00:35:42,587 --> 00:35:44,578
你去哪儿？
一会儿你就知道了
-Where are you going?
-You'll see.

554
00:36:01,172 --> 00:36:02,400
花
Flowers.

555
00:36:02,974 --> 00:36:05,704
我想这样会增加一点恰当的高雅气氛
I thought it would add just a touch of elegance.

556
00:36:06,711 --> 00:36:09,236
现在，说说小唐尼・达克的事情
Now, tell me more about Little Donnie Dark.

557
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:11,210
这会克制一下我的胃口
It might curb my appetite.

558
00:36:11,649 --> 00:36:14,550
唐尼12岁了，他是个生来就失明的人，像我一样……
Donnie is 12 years old. And he was born blind, like me...

559
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:17,019
……但是这并没有妨碍到小唐尼・达克
...but that's no handicap for Little Donnie Dark.

560
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:20,455
他能开车，开飞机，因为他其它的感官……
He can drive cars. He flies planes because his other faculties...

561
00:36:20,525 --> 00:36:24,017
……都非常发达。他能听到一英里外的银行被抢劫的声音
...are so highly developed. He can hear a bank being robbed a mile away.

562
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:26,791
他能闻到共产主义分子密谋反叛的气味
He can smell the Communists cooking a rebellious plot.

563
00:36:26,865 --> 00:36:30,528
他与犯罪，非正义做着不懈的斗争。在每本书的末尾……
He's a diligent fighter of crime, injustice,
and at the end of every book...

564
00:36:30,602 --> 00:36:34,402
……当他获得警察或者联邦调查局颁发的奖牌时，他总是说
...as he is being given a medal by the police or the FBI, he always says:

565
00:36:34,472 --> 00:36:37,703
“视而不见的人才更瞎！”
"There are none so blind as those who will not see!"

566
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,005
我要多吃点你的意大利腊肠
I'm taking some more of your salami.

567
00:36:41,779 --> 00:36:44,577
从什么时候开始警察和联邦调查局开始颁发奖牌了？
Since when do the police and the FBI give out medals?

568
00:36:44,649 --> 00:36:46,514
从我母亲说他们这样做开始
Since my mother says they do.

569
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:50,785
我们喝点什么吧
我只有葡萄酒
-Let's have a drink.
-All I've got is wine.

570
00:36:50,855 --> 00:36:52,948
我也只喝这个
配腊肠？
-That's all I drink.
-With salami?

571
00:36:53,057 --> 00:36:54,388
什么都配
With everything.

572
00:36:55,693 --> 00:36:57,558
真的有孩子读这些书吗？
Do children really read those books?

573
00:36:57,629 --> 00:37:00,894
嘘……我正在数数，这样等我回来的时候才不会踩进野餐里
I'm counting so I don't step in the picnic on the way back.

574
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,767
我刚刚把你所有的意大利腊肠都解决掉了
You have just finished your salami.

575
00:37:11,643 --> 00:37:13,076
她还继续写书吗？
Does she still write them?

576
00:37:13,144 --> 00:37:15,669
不，当我还是孩子的时候，她写了6本
No. She wrote six of them when I was a kid.

577
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,409
它们虽然不是《欢乐满人间》，但还是相当流行的，除非你是个盲人
They were no <i>Mary Poppins</i>, but pretty popular unless you are blind.

578
00:37:19,484 --> 00:37:21,850
他们没有确切地说喜欢书写成这样
They didn't exactly tell it like it is.

579
00:37:25,156 --> 00:37:28,216
我猜这些书是暗示她希望我能变成那样
I guess they were a projection of what she hoped I'd be.

580
00:37:28,593 --> 00:37:30,493
某种盲人超人
Sort of a sightless superman.

581
00:37:31,129 --> 00:37:33,859
你有去过什么特殊学校什么的吗？
Did you have to go to any special school or anything?

582
00:37:33,932 --> 00:37:36,492
我上的是普通学校。当我毕业的时候……
I went to a regular school. When I finished there...

583
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:38,468
……没有发生任何事情。直到一年前
...nothing happened to me until a year ago.

584
00:37:38,536 --> 00:37:40,265
一年前发生了什么？
What happened a year ago?

585
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:43,307
弗莱彻一家搬到我们隔壁
A family named Fletcher moved near us.

586
00:37:43,374 --> 00:37:45,672
他们的女儿琳达常常为我读文章
Their daughter Linda used to read to me.

587
00:37:45,743 --> 00:37:47,870
他是我的第一个亲密朋友
She was the first close friend I had.

588
00:37:47,946 --> 00:37:50,881
她很出色，也很粗犷
She was fantastic and wild.

589
00:37:51,215 --> 00:37:55,276
她常常把我载到这里，带我参加各种聚会
She used to drive me here all the time and take me to all kinds of parties.

590
00:37:56,154 --> 00:38:00,591
琳达给了我其他人没有想到要给我的东西――自信
Linda gave me something that nobody else had thought to give me: confidence.

591
00:38:00,825 --> 00:38:02,417
这改变了我的整个生活
It changed my whole life.

592
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,590
她说服我要离开家
She talked me into leaving home.

593
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:10,499
她为我找了这个公寓，起初，我害怕得要命
She found this apartment for me. At first, I was scared to death.

594
00:38:11,502 --> 00:38:12,730
但我做到了
But I did it.

595
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:18,435
也许这是个错误。我不知道
不，不，这不是
-Maybe it was a mistake. I don't know.
-No. No, it wasn't.

596
00:38:19,177 --> 00:38:21,111
有时候你不得不做
You'd have to do it sometime.

597
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:23,608
后来琳达怎么样了？
What's happened to Linda?

598
00:38:24,282 --> 00:38:28,616
她在我们参加的一个聚会上疯狂地爱上了一个画家，跟他一起搬到墨西哥去了
She flipped for a painter we met at a party and went to live with him in Mexico.

599
00:38:29,087 --> 00:38:32,022
我希望她能在这里。事情也许会简单许多
I wish she were here. It would make it a lot easier.

600
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,314
没事，我在呢
Well, I'm here.

601
00:38:35,226 --> 00:38:38,787
我就在隔壁右边，任何时候你需要我，只要敲敲墙壁
I'm right next door. Anytime you need me, just knock.

602
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:43,466
你甚至不需要敲，只要低语我就能听到
You don't even have to knock. You just have to whisper and I'll hear you.

603
00:38:45,937 --> 00:38:48,633
嘿，你知道吗？为什么我们不打开那扇门？
Hey, you know what? Why don't we open that door?

604
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,604
哪扇门？
通往我的公寓的那扇门
-Which door?
-That door to my apartment.

605
00:38:51,876 --> 00:38:53,639
那需要一把钥匙
There must be a key.

606
00:38:54,479 --> 00:38:55,912
我们可以翘开
Let's unlock it.

607
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,575
这样我们就能来回地出入公寓，而不用每次都跑过楼道
Then we can go back and forth without having to run down the hall.

608
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:03,178
看门人可能有把钥匙，但是我不认为我们应该去向他索取
The janitor probably has a key, but I don't think we ought to ask him.

609
00:39:03,254 --> 00:39:06,417
我不觉得我们该那样做
为什么不？我们是朋友，不是吗？
-I don't think we should do that.
-Why not? We're friends, right?

610
00:39:06,491 --> 00:39:08,823
是的，但是那样我们就几乎生活在一起了
Yeah, but we'd be practically living together.

611
00:39:08,893 --> 00:39:10,292
别人会怎么看？
How would it look?

612
00:39:12,664 --> 00:39:15,155
谁在乎怎么看？我反正看不到
Who cares how it looks? I can't see anyway.

613
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:20,701
我打赌用这把快刀就能翘开
I bet we can open it with this sharp knife.

614
00:39:20,772 --> 00:39:24,037
我们要把这个柜子挪开
好的，朝你的方向挪
-We'll have to move the chest.
-Okay. Move it towards you.

615
00:39:27,545 --> 00:39:29,012
那儿。很好
There. That's fine.

616
00:39:35,853 --> 00:39:36,842
该死！
Damn it!

617
00:39:39,257 --> 00:39:42,522
好吧，我们只能去找管理员了
让我试试
-Well, We'll have to call the janitor.
-Let me try.

618
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:59,743
你做到了！打开了！
You did it! It's open!

619
00:40:00,378 --> 00:40:03,575
别看！乱的绝对像个猪圈！
我不会的
-Don't look! It's an absolute pigsty!
-I won't.

620
00:40:04,615 --> 00:40:06,082
天，对不起
God, I'm sorry.

621
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:08,649
抱歉
I'm sorry.

622
00:40:10,588 --> 00:40:12,249
我会习惯的
I'll get the hang of it.

623
00:40:12,657 --> 00:40:14,284
我只是不知道什么时候
I just don't know when.

624
00:40:15,993 --> 00:40:17,688
哦，就让它开着吧
Oh, let's leave it open.

625
00:40:19,397 --> 00:40:22,628
好的，不过你关上的时候说一声，我才不会碰了鼻子
Okay, but tell me if you close it, so I don't break my nose.

626
00:40:24,469 --> 00:40:27,438
你会希望是琳达而不是我住在哪边吗？
Do you wish it were Linda living there instead of me?

627
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,508
我从没那么想过。你为什么这么问？
I hadn't thought about it. Why do you ask?

628
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:36,478
我只是好奇，你是否依然爱着她
I just wondered if you were still in love with her.

629
00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:39,207
我说过我爱上她了吗？
Did I say I was in love with her?

630
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:44,846
如果我问的问题过于私人，提醒我闭嘴
If I get too personal, tell me to shut up.

631
00:40:45,857 --> 00:40:47,586
我得意忘形了
I get carried away.

632
00:40:53,064 --> 00:40:54,793
你爱上了琳达了吗？
Were you in love with her?

633
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,628
嗯？
Are you?

634
00:40:59,637 --> 00:41:02,572
我想每个人都应该有些自己的秘密
I think every man should have some mystery about him.

635
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,130
而琳达就是我的秘密
And that'll be mine.

636
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:08,376
她长得怎么样？
非常可爱
-What's she like?
-She's very pretty.

637
00:41:10,014 --> 00:41:11,379
你怎么知道？
How do you know?

638
00:41:11,883 --> 00:41:15,284
我能感觉到一个人的脸，想象他们是什么样子
I can feel a person's face and get a good idea what they look like.

639
00:41:15,353 --> 00:41:17,480
我能通过外形和手感辨别
I can tell by shapes and textures.

640
00:41:18,656 --> 00:41:20,920
你好奇我长什么样子吗？
是的
-Do you wonder what I look like?
-Yes.

641
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:23,290
我很漂亮
I'm gorgeous.

642
00:41:23,928 --> 00:41:25,225
真的吗？
Are you really?

643
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,698
对于长相我可不会撒谎
I wouldn't lie about something like that.

644
00:41:31,035 --> 00:41:34,903
我常常想如果我能看见半分钟光明，那么我就能看见自己长什么样
I've always thought if I could see for half a minute then I could see how I look.

645
00:41:34,972 --> 00:41:40,308
我可以告诉你。你长得可爱又很性感
I'll tell you. Cute and very sexy.

646
00:41:49,754 --> 00:41:51,483
你的头发非常柔软
Your hair's very soft.

647
00:41:53,024 --> 00:41:54,321
很长
It's very long.

648
00:41:55,893 --> 00:41:57,155
天！
Jesus!

649
00:41:57,962 --> 00:42:00,294
哦，别害怕
怎么了？
-Oh, don't be frightened.
-What happened?

650
00:42:00,364 --> 00:42:03,800
没事。这叫假发
Nothing. It's called a fall.

651
00:42:04,168 --> 00:42:06,864
就是粘在你头上的一片长头发
It's a long piece of hair you attach to your head.

652
00:42:06,938 --> 00:42:09,338
不是你的头发？
这甚至不是我的假发套
-Not your hair?
-It's not even my fall.

653
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,101
我从苏珊・波特借来的，我自己有头发
I borrowed it from Susan Potter. I do have my own hair.

654
00:42:13,277 --> 00:42:15,302
看！我意思是说，摸摸看
See? I mean, feel.

655
00:42:24,121 --> 00:42:25,952
噢，天！现在又怎么了？
Oh, God! Now what?

656
00:42:26,624 --> 00:42:28,421
这只是假睫毛
It's just an eyelash.

657
00:42:29,093 --> 00:42:30,754
你自己没有睫毛吗？
You don't have eyelashes?

658
00:42:30,828 --> 00:42:34,764
当然有，不过假睫毛能够让我的眼睛看起来更大一点
Of course, but these just make my eyes look bigger.

659
00:42:34,832 --> 00:42:37,392
它们比我自己的要长。难道琳达都没有戴这些吗？
They're longer than mine. Didn't Linda wear them?

660
00:42:37,468 --> 00:42:38,492
没有
No.

661
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:42,237
她大概有一根天生的长辫子。我恨她
She probably had naturally long lashes. I hate her.

662
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:44,968
来吧
Come on.

663
00:42:46,444 --> 00:42:50,437
真把我吓坏了
别担心，现在起都是真的了
-This is scaring the hell out of me.
-Don't worry. It's all real from now on.

664
00:42:54,919 --> 00:42:59,117
我像伊丽莎白・泰勒吗？
我从没摸过伊丽莎白・泰勒
-Am I not the image of Elizabeth Taylor?
-I never felt Elizabeth Taylor.

665
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:03,121
我们看起来相当像。特别是如果你是盲人
We look exactly alike. Especially if you can't see.

666
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:14,297
那是我的乳房
That's my breast.

667
00:43:15,907 --> 00:43:16,999
全是我的
All mine.

668
00:43:18,776 --> 00:43:20,004
两个都是
Both of them.

669
00:43:32,456 --> 00:43:34,822
怎么了？
你觉得怎么了？
-What's matter?
-What do you think is matter?

670
00:43:34,892 --> 00:43:36,621
如果我知道就不会问了
I wouldn't ask if I knew.

671
00:43:36,861 --> 00:43:40,024
你为什么这样做？这是什么
Why are you doing this? What is it?

672
00:43:40,097 --> 00:43:42,793
残疾人友好周，还是什么的？
Be Kind to the Handicapped Week, or something?

673
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,893
甚至从你今天早上进来开始你就一直感到内疚
You've been feeling sorry for me ever since you came in here this morning.

674
00:43:47,204 --> 00:43:49,229
带他去购物，与他共度好时光
Take him shopping, show him a good time.

675
00:43:49,307 --> 00:43:52,401
为他穿衣服，然后就要关心我的社会服务了
Get him into the sack and that'll take care of my social work.

676
00:43:52,476 --> 00:43:54,842
谢谢，但这不是对我的恩赐
Thanks a lot, but don't patronize me.

677
00:43:56,314 --> 00:43:58,475
别为我感到内疚
Don't you feel sorry for me.

678
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:02,815
好吧，让我告诉你一些事情，大嘴巴
Well, let me tell you something, big mouth.

679
00:44:03,587 --> 00:44:06,681
我不会为任何人做我不想做的事情
I don't do anything for anybody I don't want to.

680
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:10,021
如果我对任何要跟我上床的家伙……
And I'll be goddamned if I'll feel sorry for any guy...

681
00:44:10,094 --> 00:44:13,325
……感到内疚的话，我会被诅咒的
...who's going to go to bed with me.

682
00:44:37,888 --> 00:44:39,685
<i>"I knew the day you met me</i>

683
00:44:40,224 --> 00:44:43,455
<i>"I could love you if you let me</i>

684
00:44:43,527 --> 00:44:47,361
<i>"Though you touched my cheek</i>
<i>and said how</i>

685
00:44:48,065 --> 00:44:50,329
<i>"easy you'd forget me you said</i>

686
00:44:50,401 --> 00:44:54,531
"Butterflies are free"

687
00:44:56,107 --> 00:44:57,199
吉尔！
Jill!

688
00:44:58,309 --> 00:45:00,641
我在这里
你在干什么？
-I'm in here.
-What are you doing?

689
00:45:00,845 --> 00:45:02,870
我在找东西
I'm looking for something.

690
00:45:03,781 --> 00:45:05,078
哦，找到了
Oh, here it is.

691
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:07,749
早上好
Good morning.

692
00:45:09,153 --> 00:45:10,984
你把头发怎么了？
What've you done to your hair?

693
00:45:11,055 --> 00:45:12,420
我只是梳理了一下
I just combed it.

694
00:45:13,124 --> 00:45:16,184
好吧，我会处理的
这样有什么不好吗？
-Well, I'll fix it.
-What's wrong with it?

695
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,455
它跟你的新衣服不搭配
It doesn't go with your new clothes.

696
00:45:18,763 --> 00:45:20,390
我给你一件礼物
I have a present for you.

697
00:45:22,633 --> 00:45:23,861
在这里
It's in here.

698
00:45:26,637 --> 00:45:28,901
美丽的木头
还有珍珠母
-Beautiful wood.
-And mother-of-pearl.

699
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:32,471
我到哪里都带着这个
I take this with me everywhere.

700
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:35,137
这里的每件东西都对我非常重要
Everything that's important to me is in here.

701
00:45:36,881 --> 00:45:39,179
这是一块月亮或者星星的石头
This is a piece of the moon or a star.

702
00:45:39,517 --> 00:45:42,486
我在沙漠里捡到的，我把它拿给地质学家看
I found it in the desert and I showed it to this geologist.

703
00:45:42,553 --> 00:45:45,113
他说他从没在地球上看见任何类似的矿石
He said he'd never seen any mineral like it on earth.

704
00:45:45,189 --> 00:45:47,487
可能是从月亮或者星星上陨落的
It probably fell from the moon or a star.

705
00:45:47,558 --> 00:45:50,891
它感觉就像是一块石头
好吧，它不是
-It feels like a rock.
-Well, it isn't.

706
00:45:53,964 --> 00:45:56,956
这是一颗我的乳牙
And this is one of my baby teeth.

707
00:45:59,737 --> 00:46:00,829
谢谢
Thank you.

708
00:46:01,906 --> 00:46:04,306
这是我的出生证明
And this is my birth certificate.

709
00:46:05,176 --> 00:46:08,873
这是我在高中表演音乐剧《天皇》的一张照片
And this is a picture of me when I was in <i>The Mikado</i> in high school.

710
00:46:08,946 --> 00:46:12,006
哦，这个不是很好
不，让我看看
-Oh, it's not very good, anyway.
-No, let me see it.

711
00:46:13,884 --> 00:46:15,818
你以前有点胖
是的
-You were chubbier then.
-Yeah.

712
00:46:16,987 --> 00:46:21,651
你能感觉的出来？哦，我信任你
Can you feel that? Oh, I believed you.

713
00:46:22,693 --> 00:46:24,388
我总是相信你
I always believe you.

714
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:28,796
这是我的最后遗嘱
And this is my last will and testament.

715
00:46:28,999 --> 00:46:30,728
你的最后遗嘱？
Your last will and testament?

716
00:46:30,801 --> 00:46:35,204
这是我葬礼的流程文件。我的全部遗产将被平均……
And the instructions to my funeral. My entire estate is to be divided equally...

717
00:46:35,272 --> 00:46:38,400
……分给那些我临终时最亲密的四个朋友
...among whoever are my four closest friends when I die.

718
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:41,341
名字将在随后填上
Names will be filled in later.

719
00:46:41,412 --> 00:46:44,939
你看上去身体健康的很
不是因为疾病
-I thought you didn't like anything morbid.
-But it isn't morbid.

720
00:46:45,015 --> 00:46:46,346
这才是重点
That's the point.

721
00:46:47,084 --> 00:46:49,177
葬礼并不是因为疾病而举行
Funerals don't have to be morbid.

722
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:54,023
我只是写上我像要的埋葬方式，在一个大教堂里……
I know just how I want mine. In a big church...

723
00:46:55,526 --> 00:46:57,790
……把所有的椅子都搬走……
...and I want all the pews removed...

724
00:46:57,962 --> 00:47:01,227
……只有一个大垫子让人们随意躺坐
...and nothing but big cushions for people to lie around on.

725
00:47:01,298 --> 00:47:03,994
我希望没有人穿着丧服
And I don't want anybody dressed in black.

726
00:47:04,068 --> 00:47:07,799
他们应全部穿着欢快，明亮的颜色和奇特的衣服
They should all be in gay, bright colors and far-out clothes.

727
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:11,766
他们应当在喝酒，或者抽水烟，或者任何他们想做的事情
They should all be drinking or smoking pot or whatever they want.

728
00:47:13,677 --> 00:47:17,670
我想让萨尔瓦多・达利用许多绝妙的画来粉饰墙壁
And I want Salvador Dali to paint the walls with lots of groovy pictures.

729
00:47:19,283 --> 00:47:21,012
我还希望能有鲜花
And I want flowers.

730
00:47:22,219 --> 00:47:23,811
许多鲜花
Tons of flowers.

731
00:47:24,722 --> 00:47:25,950
不要花圈
Not funeral wreaths.

732
00:47:26,023 --> 00:47:29,117
只需要在四处散落许多野花
Just tons of wild flowers strewn everywhere.

733
00:47:29,426 --> 00:47:30,791
还有蝴蝶
And butterflies.

734
00:47:31,195 --> 00:47:33,857
是的，许多蝴蝶
Yes, lots of butterflies.

735
00:47:34,431 --> 00:47:36,456
当然，其他动物也行
And other animals can come, too.

736
00:47:38,235 --> 00:47:40,863
我希望自始至终都有音乐伴奏
I want music playing all the time.

737
00:47:42,173 --> 00:47:45,836
我想让尼尔・戴蒙德为我写一首特殊的悼念歌曲，并亲自演唱
And I want Neil Diamond to write me a special memoriam and sing it.

738
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:47,400
我想让斯通……
I want the Stones to sing...

739
00:47:47,478 --> 00:47:51,209
……还有西蒙和加芬克尔，以及也纳童声合唱团来演唱
...and Simon and Garfunkel and the Vienna Boys' Choir.

740
00:47:52,183 --> 00:47:53,172
还有我
And me.

741
00:48:28,452 --> 00:48:29,783
当然有你
Definitely you.

742
00:48:30,087 --> 00:48:32,385
你患了什么病要写这些？
没有病
-What is so morbid about that?
-Nothing.

743
00:48:32,456 --> 00:48:34,720
看起来是要埋在迪斯尼乐园里
It's like being buried at Disneyland.

744
00:48:35,659 --> 00:48:38,560
找到了。给你的礼物
Here it is. A present for you.

745
00:48:41,899 --> 00:48:44,094
是什么？
它摸起来像什么
-What is it?
-What does it feel like?

746
00:48:44,168 --> 00:48:45,897
像是一根项链
It feels like a necklace.

747
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:49,105
这是彩色链珠。当我是嬉皮士的时候戴的
They're love beads. I wore them when I was a hippie.

748
00:48:49,607 --> 00:48:51,438
我想把它送给你
And I want you to have them.

749
00:48:52,743 --> 00:48:56,076
它们看上去很配你，特别是我给你打理完头发
They look groovy on you, especially when I fix your hair.

750
00:48:56,146 --> 00:48:56,874
来吧
Come on.

751
00:49:00,317 --> 00:49:01,648
坐在这儿
Sit right here.

752
00:49:10,928 --> 00:49:13,897
我不想看起来太狂野了
你看起来根本不狂野
-I don't want to look too wild.
-You won't look wild at all.

753
00:49:13,964 --> 00:49:16,660
你会看起来像拜伦勋爵那样漂亮和浪漫
You'll look beautiful and romantic like Lord Byron.

754
00:49:16,734 --> 00:49:19,202
他长得什么样？
我不知道
-What did he look like?
-I don't know.

755
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:20,764
天，我饿了
God, I'm hungry.

756
00:49:20,838 --> 00:49:23,398
在冰箱里有几个苹果
太好了
-There are a couple of apples in the fridge.
-Good.

757
00:49:27,478 --> 00:49:30,879
有几颗可怕的莴苣，这可不是我想要的
There's an awful lot of lettuce, which is not what I'm dreaming of.

758
00:49:30,948 --> 00:49:34,714
只有一个苹果
你吃吧。我不饿
-There's only one apple.
-It's yours. I'm not hungry.

759
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:44,188
现在，放松，一点也不痛
Now, relax. It won't hurt a bit.

760
00:49:45,896 --> 00:49:50,060
你什么时候当过嬉皮士？
几年前，我还是个孩子的时候
-When were you a hippie?
-Years ago, when I was a kid.

761
00:49:50,934 --> 00:49:53,198
我猜就在我结婚之后
I guess it was right after my marriage.

762
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:58,401
那时我常在日落大道闲逛，抽水烟，向警察吐口水，什么的
I used to hang around the Sunset Strip, smoke pot, spit at the cops, the whole bit.

763
00:49:59,443 --> 00:50:02,241
我这样做只是因为其他人都这么做
I only did it because everybody else was doing it.

764
00:50:02,313 --> 00:50:05,840
后来我不做了，因为其他人都这么做
And then I stopped doing it because everybody else was doing it.

765
00:50:06,083 --> 00:50:08,051
我丧失了我的个性
I was losing my individuality.

766
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:16,651
当然，最主要的是，为了向我的母亲抗议……
But the main thing, of course, was to protest against my mother...

767
00:50:17,094 --> 00:50:18,493
……不过没什么用
...which didn't work.

768
00:50:18,562 --> 00:50:22,931
有一天我留着又长又枯的头发，穿着肮脏的凉鞋和夸张的衣服走进来……
I walked in one day with long, stringy hair, dirty sandals and freaky clothes...

769
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,490
……结果她喜欢我的装扮
...and she loved it.

770
00:50:24,935 --> 00:50:28,098
然后她也打扮成这样……
Then she comes in with long, stringy hair, dirty sandals...

771
00:50:28,172 --> 00:50:29,764
……
...and freaky clothes.

772
00:50:30,641 --> 00:50:34,873
你怎么能向跟你做一样事情的人抗议呢？对吧？
How do you protest against somebody who's doing the same thing you are, right?

773
00:50:35,813 --> 00:50:41,080
所以我采取了其他方法，我加入了共和党青年团
So, then I went the other way and I joined the Young Republicans.

774
00:50:42,386 --> 00:50:43,785
又是一个错误
Another mistake.

775
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:50,884
根本就没有共和党青年团
There's no such thing as a young republican.

776
00:50:59,203 --> 00:51:01,103
好了，你看起来棒极了
There. You look terrific.

777
00:51:01,338 --> 00:51:04,364
不会太狂野吧？
不，不会
-It doesn't look too wild?
-No. It doesn't look wild.

778
00:51:04,608 --> 00:51:07,008
这让你有魅力
美丽？
-It gives you charisma.
-Charisma?

779
00:51:07,478 --> 00:51:10,140
潇洒！星光闪耀！
Pizzazz! Star quality!

780
00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:14,943
我的意思是，如果你有魅力，你甚至不需要天分
I mean, you don't even need talent if you have charisma.

781
00:51:15,018 --> 00:51:17,316
他们会排着队踮起脚来看你
They'll line up for blocks to see you.

782
00:51:21,825 --> 00:51:22,792
哇
Wow.

783
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:43,546
你真美
You're beautiful.

784
00:51:45,282 --> 00:51:47,750
你是个内外都很美的人
You're a beautiful person inside and out.

785
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,512
我也喜欢你
Well, I like you, too.

786
00:51:55,192 --> 00:51:59,026
昨天当我把你的手放在我的……
Yesterday when I took your hand and put it on my breast...

787
00:52:00,197 --> 00:52:01,687
……乳房上时，你吓了一跳？
...were you shocked?

788
00:52:02,332 --> 00:52:03,560
有点
Sort of.

789
00:52:03,901 --> 00:52:05,129
我也是
So was I.

790
00:52:05,202 --> 00:52:08,035
这不是道德或者其他什么的观点
I don't mean from the standpoint of morals or anything.

791
00:52:08,105 --> 00:52:12,098
我只是惊讶在我没有预料的情况下，触摸一个女孩的乳房
I was surprised to be feeling a girl's breast when I wasn't expecting to.

792
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:16,973
我恨你把我想象成，那种到处随便把男人的手放在我的乳房上的人
I'd hate for you to think that I go around putting men's hands on my breast.

793
00:52:17,047 --> 00:52:19,481
不，我没有把你当成那种随便的人
No, I don't think you go around doing that.

794
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:20,812
我不是
Well, I don't.

795
00:52:23,387 --> 00:52:27,687
我的意思是，如果我想要和一个人上床，我通常面带一点微笑……
I mean, if I want to go to bed with a guy usually I have this little smile...

796
00:52:27,758 --> 00:52:30,022
……让他知道我的想法
...that lets him know I'm interested.

797
00:52:30,294 --> 00:52:32,956
哦，是吗？什么样的微笑。我想感受一下
Oh, yeah? Smile that smile. I want to feel it.

798
00:52:33,764 --> 00:52:35,959
那就是？
不
-That's it?
-No.

799
00:52:36,433 --> 00:52:39,368
我现在做不出来。你让我发笑
I can't do it now. You're making me laugh.

800
00:52:39,636 --> 00:52:41,001
我一会儿再示范
I'll do it later.

801
00:52:42,406 --> 00:52:46,502
但是，我最好跟你还是用不同的沟通手段，是吗？
But I did have to use a different approach with you, didn't I?

802
00:52:48,879 --> 00:52:51,712
另外，我不想让你认为我是个讨厌的人
Anyway, I didn't want you to think I was terrible.

803
00:52:51,882 --> 00:52:53,008
我没有
I didn't.

804
00:52:54,351 --> 00:52:55,716
我不会
I don't.

805
00:52:58,589 --> 00:53:00,784
哦，我讨厌把性拿来讨论
Oh, I hate talking about sex.

806
00:53:03,727 --> 00:53:07,094
但是我确实想让你知道昨晚，你……
But I did want you to know that last night you were....

807
00:53:08,131 --> 00:53:09,530
你真的……
You were really....

808
00:53:10,801 --> 00:53:12,632
就像是国庆节的焰火？
Like the Fourth of July?

809
00:53:12,903 --> 00:53:16,771
是的，就像是国庆节的焰火，像圣诞节
Yeah. Like the Fourth of July. And like Christmas.

810
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:22,712
你要去哪里？
我想来杯咖啡
-Where are you going?
-I thought I'd make some coffee.

811
00:53:22,913 --> 00:53:25,108
好极了。我们在床上吃早餐
Great. We'll have breakfast in bed.

812
00:53:59,716 --> 00:54:03,174
你好，母亲
我很高兴我找到你了，唐尼
-Hello, Mother.
-I'm glad I found you in, Donnie.

813
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,115
吉尔，这是我母亲
Jill, this is my mother.

814
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:10,586
你的母亲？难道我呆在这里已经一个月了？
Your mother? Have I been here a month?

815
00:54:12,095 --> 00:54:13,926
母亲，这是本森太太
Mother, this is Mrs. Benson.

816
00:54:16,633 --> 00:54:19,693
你好？
你好，本森，太太？
-How do you do?
-How do you do, Mrs. Benson?

817
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:21,699
你也住在这里吗？
Are you living here, too?

818
00:54:21,805 --> 00:54:23,568
不，我住在隔壁
No, I live next door.

819
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:28,974
我昨天只是进来要杯咖啡
I just came in for a cup of coffee yesterday.

820
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:33,511
我的衬衫拉链拉不上
我明白了
-I had trouble zipping up my blouse.
-So I see.

821
00:54:34,217 --> 00:54:35,741
你的衬衫在哪里？
Where is your blouse?

822
00:54:36,954 --> 00:54:40,117
我看看，一定在周围的什么地方
Now let me see, it must be around here somewhere.

823
00:54:40,424 --> 00:54:42,016
哦，在这里
Oh, here it is.

824
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:46,894
你瞧，我要拉上这么长的拉链，自己很难做到的
You see, I have this long zipper and it's hard to do up alone.

825
00:54:47,331 --> 00:54:49,322
这里，把你的衣服穿上
Here, put your things on.

826
00:54:50,067 --> 00:54:52,729
母亲，你来这里干什么？我们有约定的
Mother, what're you doing here? We had an agreement.

827
00:54:52,803 --> 00:54:54,395
我恰好在附近
I was in the neighborhood.

828
00:54:54,471 --> 00:54:56,871
你去的是塞克斯百货，要穿越半个城呢
You were at Saks, which is halfway across town.

829
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,134
我给你买了些衬衫……
I bought you some shirts...

830
00:54:58,208 --> 00:55:01,371
……并且我想如果自己送来，你就能及时地穿上了
...and I thought you'd have them sooner if I brought them myself.

831
00:55:01,445 --> 00:55:03,174
我不再需要衬衫了
I don't need any shirts.

832
00:55:03,413 --> 00:55:06,109
你把它当成来这里的一个借口
You bought them as an excuse to come down here.

833
00:55:06,283 --> 00:55:07,580
你介意吗？
Would you mind?

834
00:55:11,521 --> 00:55:12,647
谢谢
Thank you.

835
00:55:13,857 --> 00:55:16,655
这就是你离家住的地方吗？
是的
-And this is what you left home for?
-This is it.

836
00:55:16,927 --> 00:55:20,226
这不是白金汉宫，对吧？
是的，这是个泰姬陵
-It isn't Buckingham Palace, is it?
-No, it's the Taj Mahal.

837
00:55:20,297 --> 00:55:22,629
这就是你吃饭的地方，在地板上？
Is this where you eat, on the floor?

838
00:55:22,899 --> 00:55:24,867
那恰好是海滩
That happens to be a beach.

839
00:55:25,235 --> 00:55:27,396
这些家具打哪儿来的？
Where did this furniture come from?

840
00:55:27,704 --> 00:55:30,901
一些是公寓原来就有的，其余的从一家旧货店买的
Some of it came with the apartment. The rest from a junk shop.

841
00:55:30,974 --> 00:55:33,704
别告诉我，我猜猜看
Don't tell me which is which. Let me guess.

842
00:55:35,078 --> 00:55:37,706
天知道这叫什么？
What in God's name is this?

843
00:55:39,683 --> 00:55:41,674
我不知道你看到了什么
I don't know what you're looking at.

844
00:55:41,752 --> 00:55:43,515
我无法描述
I can't describe it.

845
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,319
这是我的公寓
It's my apartment.

846
00:55:46,657 --> 00:55:49,956
你是否想过要雇一个佣人，本森太太？
Have you ever thought of hiring a maid, Mrs. Benson?

847
00:55:50,427 --> 00:55:51,655
我可以自己处理
I can manage.

848
00:55:51,995 --> 00:55:56,091
我也许邋遢，但是不肮脏，“邋遢”与“肮脏”还是有区别的
I might be sloppy, but not dirty. There's a difference between "sloppy" and "dirty."

849
00:55:56,166 --> 00:56:00,034
我很高兴听到这些。这扇门总是开着的吗？
I'm so glad to hear that. Has this door always been open?

850
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:04,036
不，过去通常是关着。我昨晚打开了
No. It's always been locked. I opened it last night.

851
00:56:05,342 --> 00:56:08,175
那到底是什么东西？
现在你在看什么？
-What on earth is that?
-Now what are you looking at?

852
00:56:08,245 --> 00:56:10,509
我也想知道
是你的床
-That's what I'd like to know.
-It's your bed.

853
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,810
是我的床
它是不是很棒？
-It's my bed.
-Isn't it terrific?

854
00:56:13,216 --> 00:56:15,116
你居然在上面睡？
You actually sleep up there?

855
00:56:15,352 --> 00:56:18,014
像个婴儿
如果你跌下来怎么办？
-Like a baby.
-What happens if you fall out?

856
00:56:18,221 --> 00:56:21,918
我会走到梯子那里，然后再爬上去
你的衣服在哪里？
-I go to the ladder and climb up again.
-Where are your clothes?

857
00:56:22,325 --> 00:56:23,553
在浴室
In the bathroom.

858
00:56:23,627 --> 00:56:26,790
浴室在哪里，床下吗？
正是
-Where is the bathroom, under the bed?
-That's right.

859
00:56:41,511 --> 00:56:44,241
哇！你说的非常正确
关于什么的？
-Wow! Were you ever right?
-About what?

860
00:56:44,381 --> 00:56:47,544
她永远不会得过梅毒。我怀疑她是你的亲生母亲
She never had syphilis. I'm surprised she had you.

861
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:50,513
你为什么把我介绍成本森太太？
How come you introduced me as Mrs. Benson?

862
00:56:50,587 --> 00:56:52,680
这会让你听起来显得更有地位
It made you sound more important.

863
00:56:57,227 --> 00:56:59,320
她在干什么？
试试抽水马桶
-What's she doing?
-Testing the plumbing.

864
00:56:59,396 --> 00:57:01,227
她对水管什么的很痴迷
She's a nut about plumbing.

865
00:57:05,335 --> 00:57:06,802
你怎么知道你妈妈来了？
How'd you know it was her?

866
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:08,895
她进来的时候，没有发出任何声响
When she came in she didn't make a sound.

867
00:57:08,972 --> 00:57:12,203
闻出来的。她用的香水叫Numero Dix，每次都用掉半瓶
Smell. It's called Numero Dix. She uses half a bottle at a time.

868
00:57:12,275 --> 00:57:14,470
当她在附近的时候，我总是能知道
And I always know when she's around.

869
00:57:15,879 --> 00:57:17,574
就好像系在猫咪脖子上的铃铛
It's like having a bell on a cat.

870
00:57:23,887 --> 00:57:25,377
现在她在干什么？
Now what's she doing?

871
00:57:26,423 --> 00:57:29,483
检查一下我是否有足够的袜子和内衣
Checking to see if I've got enough socks and underwear.

872
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:34,023
她正在收集能够打击我的证据，好让我回家
She is gathering evidence to hit me with and try to make me come home.

873
00:57:34,097 --> 00:57:37,692
她已经改变了她的策略。过去她会走进来说：
She's changed her tactics, though. She should have walked in and said:

874
00:57:37,768 --> 00:57:39,497
“我都要哭了”
"I could absolutely cry."

875
00:57:39,569 --> 00:57:41,833
她会说的
不会，我知道她所有的口头禅
-She'll say it.
-No. I know all her routines.

876
00:57:41,905 --> 00:57:45,341
她会说。我跟你打个赌。赌今晚的晚饭怎么样？
She'll say it. I'll make you a bet. How about dinner tonight?

877
00:57:45,442 --> 00:57:49,344
如果她没有说，那么我输了。我们就在我那边吃饭，我来付钱
Now, if she doesn't say it, then I lose and we eat in my place and I pay.

878
00:57:49,412 --> 00:57:51,710
如果她说了。我们在这里吃饭，你来付钱
But if she says it, we eat here and you pay.

879
00:57:51,782 --> 00:57:53,841
成交
她来了
-Okay.
-Here she comes.

880
00:57:58,388 --> 00:58:01,949
好吧，那就是所谓的浴室
Well, that's some bathroom.

881
00:58:02,025 --> 00:58:05,620
难怪你会把它藏在床下
我想你还要说点别的
-No wonder you hide it under the bed.
-I thought you'd say something else.

882
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,822
我还没说完。我甚至还没开始
I haven't finished. I haven't even started.

883
00:58:07,898 --> 00:58:11,197
继续说浴室吧，把它说完
只有一件实情可以讲
-Say it and get it over with.
-There's only one thing to say.

884
00:58:11,268 --> 00:58:14,396
也许你该感恩看不见你住的地方
Perhaps it's a blessing that you can't see what you're living in.

885
00:58:14,471 --> 00:58:17,372
母亲，当我走进这扇门的时候，我就时时刻刻都在感恩
Mother, I count that blessing every time I walk in the door.

886
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,340
唐尼，我能说实话吗？
Donnie, can I be honest?

887
00:58:19,743 --> 00:58:21,267
你会吗？
就是这句了
-Can you?
-This is it.

888
00:58:21,578 --> 00:58:23,603
我很震惊，还充满恐惧
I am shocked and appalled.

889
00:58:24,247 --> 00:58:25,544
哦，我输了
Oh, I lose.

890
00:58:25,849 --> 00:58:27,476
7点半，行不？
可以
-7:30, okay?
-Perfect.

891
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:29,978
在你的浴室里没有浴盆
There's no tub in your bathroom.

892
00:58:30,287 --> 00:58:32,118
浴盆在餐桌下面
It's under the dining table.

893
00:58:38,728 --> 00:58:40,662
我都要哭了
I could absolutely cry.

894
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:43,130
你赢了！吃汉堡包行吗？
You win! Are hamburgers all right?

895
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,929
耶。但至少每人两个
Yeah. But at least two each.

896
00:58:45,001 --> 00:58:48,493
这里就像个老鼠洞，唐尼。我也要说说你
I'm not talking about this rat hole, Donnie. I'm talking about you, too.

897
00:58:48,572 --> 00:58:50,631
看看你。你头上是什么东西？
Look at you. What's that on your head?

898
00:58:50,707 --> 00:58:53,141
法国海外雇用军帽
你入伍了？
-French Foreign Legion cap.
-Have you enlisted?

899
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:54,700
没有，我过去被征召过
No, I was drafted.

900
00:58:54,911 --> 00:58:57,709
我没有说这个。你瘦了
I'm not just talking about that. You have lost weight.

901
00:58:57,781 --> 00:59:00,409
我没有，我的体重刚好配我的身高
I haven't. I'm the perfect weight for my height.

902
00:59:00,483 --> 00:59:05,318
6尺1英寸，而且我11岁了
我要看看你都吃些什么
-6'1" and my age, 11.
-I'd just like to see what you're eating.

903
00:59:08,191 --> 00:59:11,683
为什么？这里没东西，只有些莴苣和一个苹果
Why, there's nothing in here but lettuce and an apple.

904
00:59:12,429 --> 00:59:13,453
哪里？
Where?

905
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:15,195
在莴苣后面
Behind the lettuce.

906
00:59:15,265 --> 00:59:19,164
你瞧，我知道还有一个
告诉我，本森先生在哪里？
-See, I knew there was another one.
-Tell me, where is Mr. Benson?

907
00:59:19,803 --> 00:59:22,829
谁是本森先生？
我想应该是你的丈夫
-Who's Mr. Benson?
-I assumed he was your husband.

908
00:59:24,174 --> 00:59:26,870
哦，你是指杰克。我不知道
Oh, you mean Jack. I don't know.

909
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:30,739
我上一次看见他，是在繁华大街的一家汉堡包农庄店外面
The last I saw him, he was outside of the Hamburger Hamlet on the Strip.

910
00:59:30,814 --> 00:59:34,341
怎么了？
我对你的婚姻状况很好奇
-Why?
-I was curious about your marital status.

911
00:59:35,752 --> 00:59:38,277
我没有结婚
吉尔离婚了，母亲
-I haven't any.
-Jill's divorced, Mother.

912
00:59:38,688 --> 00:59:40,952
好吧，你多大了，本森太太？
Well, how old are you, Mrs. Benson?

913
00:59:42,392 --> 00:59:43,416
19
Nineteen.

914
00:59:43,894 --> 00:59:45,156
19岁？
Nineteen?

915
00:59:45,228 --> 00:59:48,163
你就已经结婚还离婚了？
And you've already been married and divorced?

916
00:59:48,498 --> 00:59:49,396
是的
Yeah.

917
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:51,528
你结婚多久？
How long were you married?

918
00:59:52,469 --> 00:59:53,527
6天
Six days.

919
00:59:54,104 --> 00:59:56,368
在第七天，你休息了？
And on the seventh day, you rested?

920
00:59:57,674 --> 00:59:58,800
不是，我结束了
No, I split.

921
00:59:59,643 --> 01:00:01,873
我现在需要改变了。我是个等待试镜的演员
I got to change now. I have an audition.

922
01:00:01,945 --> 01:00:05,972
等待什么的试镜？
一出戏。在宇宙工厂
-Audition for what?
-A play. At the Cosmic Workshop.

923
01:00:06,216 --> 01:00:08,309
我正在跟本森太太聊天
I was speaking to Mrs. Benson.

924
01:00:08,585 --> 01:00:10,985
一出戏。在宇宙工厂
A play. At the Cosmic Workshop.

925
01:00:12,889 --> 01:00:14,516
这么说，你是一个演员
Then, you're an actress.

926
01:00:14,758 --> 01:00:15,850
是的
Well, yeah.

927
01:00:15,926 --> 01:00:19,089
除了你的内裤之外，我能看见你穿点别的吗？
Might I have seen you in anything besides your underwear?

928
01:00:21,431 --> 01:00:23,991
除非你去比佛利山高中
Not unless you went to Beverly Hills High School.

929
01:00:24,067 --> 01:00:25,932
我在音乐剧《天皇》中饰演
I was in <i>The Mikado</i>.

930
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:28,528
洋洋
I played Yum-Yum.

931
01:00:29,472 --> 01:00:31,497
我相信你演过
I'm sure you did.

932
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:36,105
你的母亲知道你在哪里吗？
Does your mother know where you are?

933
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:38,010
当然
Sure.

934
01:00:38,081 --> 01:00:40,709
她同意你的生活方式吗？
And does she approve of the way you're living?

935
01:00:42,252 --> 01:00:43,879
我的什么生活方式？
What way am I living?

936
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:46,545
母亲，你是在做什么调查吗？
Mother, are you conducting some kind of survey?

937
01:00:46,623 --> 01:00:48,818
唐尼，你在自讨苦吃
You're asking for it, Donnie.

938
01:00:49,526 --> 01:00:52,552
我相信本森太太不会介意回答几个问题
I'm sure Mrs. Benson doesn't mind answering a few questions.

939
01:00:52,629 --> 01:00:54,859
是吧，本森太太？
我已经面试过了
-Do you, Mrs. Benson?
-I have this audition.

940
01:00:54,931 --> 01:00:56,922
你的父亲是做什么的？
What does your father do?

941
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,862
哪一个？
你有多少个父亲？
-Which one?
-How many fathers have you?

942
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:02,730
4个，一个亲的，3个后继的
Four. One real and three steps.

943
01:01:02,939 --> 01:01:05,567
你母亲已经结了4次婚？
Your mother has been married four times?

944
01:01:06,376 --> 01:01:09,072
远不止。我们住在洛杉矶
So far. We live in Los Angeles.

945
01:01:10,313 --> 01:01:12,907
也就是说你来自一个破碎的家庭
Then you come from a broken home.

946
01:01:13,416 --> 01:01:14,576
有那么点意思
Several.

947
01:01:14,818 --> 01:01:17,343
为什么你母亲这么经常结婚？
Why does your mother marry so often?

948
01:01:19,589 --> 01:01:21,887
我不知道。我猜她喜欢这样吧
I don't know. I guess she likes it.

949
01:01:22,892 --> 01:01:26,953
我的意思是，她喜欢结婚的过程。但是显然不喜欢结婚后的生活
I mean, she likes getting married. Obviously, she doesn't like being married.

950
01:01:27,364 --> 01:01:29,832
我想，现在我最好离开了，好吗？
Now, I think I'd better get started, okay?

951
01:01:33,436 --> 01:01:34,266
再见！
Ciao!

952
01:01:34,337 --> 01:01:38,296
别忘了7点半这里见
7点半这里要干什么
-Don't forget: 7:30, here.
-What happens at 7:30 here?

953
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:41,310
吉尔和我要一起吃晚饭
Jill and I are having dinner together.

954
01:01:41,411 --> 01:01:44,380
只有我们两个
本森太太？
-Just the two of us, alone.
-Mrs. Benson?

955
01:01:46,149 --> 01:01:48,640
我想你忘记了什么
什么？
-I think you've forgotten something.
-What is it?

956
01:01:48,718 --> 01:01:50,208
苏珊・波特的假发
Susan Potter's hair.

957
01:01:51,554 --> 01:01:54,318
我把门关上了
我没有怪你
-I'm closing the door.
-I don't blame you.

958
01:01:56,026 --> 01:01:59,894
你一定要这么粗鲁吗？
我粗鲁吗？
-Did you have to be so goddamn rude?
-Was I rude?

959
01:02:00,463 --> 01:02:02,090
问这些个问题
All those questions.

960
01:02:02,198 --> 01:02:04,462
你难道是希尔斯波路的首席检察官吗？
Are you the attorney general of Hillsborough?

961
01:02:04,534 --> 01:02:08,129
我想我有权力知道关于我儿子朋友的事情
I think I have a right to know something about my son's friends.

962
01:02:08,805 --> 01:02:10,670
权利？那谈谈我的权利吧
Rights? Let's talk about my rights.

963
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:13,072
你应该下个月才出现的
You're not supposed to be here for another month.

964
01:02:13,143 --> 01:02:14,474
你今天为什么来？
Why'd you come today?

965
01:02:14,544 --> 01:02:16,978
从什么时候开始，你像这样跟我讲话了？
Since when do you speak to me like this?

966
01:02:17,047 --> 01:02:19,311
从你偷偷溜进我的房间开始
Since when do you sneak into my room?

967
01:02:19,382 --> 01:02:22,408
我没有。房门没有上锁
你该先敲门
-I didn't. The door was unlocked.
-You could have knocked.

968
01:02:22,485 --> 01:02:24,783
这是一次突袭检查
早就该检查了
-I thought it was a raid.
-It should've been.

969
01:02:24,854 --> 01:02:28,221
你为什么不锁房门？
因为直到我知道门周围的路……
-Why don't you lock your door?
-Because until I knew my way around...

970
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:30,350
……让人更容易进来
...it was easier to let people come in.

971
01:02:30,427 --> 01:02:33,487
但我告诉你，从现在开始它必须锁上
But I assure you, it will be locked from now on.

972
01:02:34,998 --> 01:02:39,128
我原以为我今天来这里是给你一个大惊喜
Well, I thought my coming here today was going to be a nice surprise for you.

973
01:02:39,202 --> 01:02:42,069
如果我知道会受到如此待遇……
至少你已经来了
-If I knew I'd be treated like this--
-You'd have come anyway.

974
01:02:42,138 --> 01:02:45,437
我很高兴我来了。我最糟糕的担忧已经变成了现实
I'm glad I did. My worst fears have been realized.

975
01:02:45,508 --> 01:02:47,032
谢天谢地
Thank heaven for that.

976
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:50,409
我最担忧的是，你最担忧的事情没有变为现实
My worst fear was that your worst fears wouldn't be realized.

977
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:54,473
想象一下，如果你走进来，对一切都满意。我们就没有话题可说了
Imagine if you came in here and liked it? We'd have nothing to talk about.

978
01:02:54,551 --> 01:02:57,452
你一定要选择这样肮脏的一个邻居吗？
Did you have to choose such a sordid neighborhood?

979
01:02:57,787 --> 01:02:59,914
对我而言，看上去跟希尔斯波路没什么区别
To me, it looks just like Hillsborough.

980
01:02:59,989 --> 01:03:03,152
如果我跟这种类人作邻居，我一定会吓坏的
I'd be terrified to live with the type of people around here.

981
01:03:03,226 --> 01:03:05,922
他们对我很好
我打赌他们会的
-They've been nice to me.
-I'll bet they have.

982
01:03:06,196 --> 01:03:09,632
昨天你告诉我你几乎不知道本森太太的名字
Yesterday you told me you didn't even know Mrs. Benson's name.

983
01:03:09,966 --> 01:03:11,558
那是昨天
That was yesterday.

984
01:03:12,735 --> 01:03:15,636
那么，你们无疑非常匆忙就成为朋友了，对吗？
Well, you certainly became friends in a hurry, didn't you?

985
01:03:15,705 --> 01:03:18,868
她是个非常友善的女孩
是的，我看她也是
-She's a very friendly girl.
-Yes, I can see she is.

986
01:03:19,209 --> 01:03:21,575
我能问个私人问题吗？
不行
-May I ask you a personal question?
-No.

987
01:03:21,744 --> 01:03:25,475
你跟这个女孩睡过了吗？
我想你最好别问
-Have you slept with this girl?
-I thought you'd never ask.

988
01:03:26,349 --> 01:03:27,611
是的
Yes, I have.

989
01:03:28,685 --> 01:03:31,779
好像我不知道一样
如果你知道，你为什么要问？
-As if I didn't know.
-If you know, why do you ask?

990
01:03:31,855 --> 01:03:34,790
现在我知道你为什么这么急切地要独立生活了
Now I know why you were so anxious to have your own place.

991
01:03:34,858 --> 01:03:36,052
哦，我知道了，唐尼
I know you, Donnie.

992
01:03:36,126 --> 01:03:38,287
你的表情就像是又看到了琳达・弗莱切
You've got that Linda Fletcher look again.

993
01:03:38,361 --> 01:03:41,091
你也爱上了这个女孩
如果确实这样呢？
-You'll fall in love with this girl, too.
-And if I do?

994
01:03:41,164 --> 01:03:43,029
我是异性恋这困扰到你了吗？
Does it bother you I'm heterosexual?

995
01:03:43,099 --> 01:03:46,364
本森太太完全不是一个母亲所梦想的儿媳
Mrs. Benson is not exactly the girl a mother dreams of for her son.

996
01:03:46,436 --> 01:03:48,802
我对你所梦想的女孩不感兴趣
I'm not interested in the girl of your dreams.

997
01:03:48,872 --> 01:03:52,467
她的小圆眼睛长得象鸟，手指像旗杆
She's got beady little eyes like a bird and a figure like a flagpole.

998
01:03:52,542 --> 01:03:54,339
你描述的女孩正是我所梦想的
You've described the girl of my dreams.

999
01:03:54,444 --> 01:03:57,880
你看不出好的和坏的区别。我能
You can't see the difference between good and bad. I can.

1000
01:03:57,947 --> 01:04:00,438
我能观察人们的脸和眼睛。你不能
I can look into people's faces and eyes. You can't.

1001
01:04:00,517 --> 01:04:02,849
我能穿越他们的眼睛，看到他们的灵魂
I can see past their eyes, into their souls.

1002
01:04:02,919 --> 01:04:06,150
请别忘记了小唐尼・达克，还有他的幻视能力
Leave us not forget Little Donnie Dark and all that vision.

1003
01:04:06,222 --> 01:04:10,090
我希望你确实有那种幻视能力
我确信你有，母亲
-I wish you did have some of that vision.
-I'm sure you do, Mother.

1004
01:04:10,927 --> 01:04:14,328
事实上你难道没有因为你生下了一个失明孩子而感到羞耻？
Deep down haven't you always been ashamed you produced a blind child?

1005
01:04:14,397 --> 01:04:17,423
这没什么可羞愧的
那么尴尬呢？
-There's nothing to be ashamed of.
-Embarrassed, then?

1006
01:04:18,168 --> 01:04:21,296
你从来没给我尴尬的理由
You have never given me reason to be embarrassed by you.

1007
01:04:26,609 --> 01:04:27,974
进来
Come on in.

1008
01:04:29,846 --> 01:04:31,541
很抱歉打断你们
I hate to bother you.

1009
01:04:31,748 --> 01:04:32,942
什么事？
What is it?

1010
01:04:33,249 --> 01:04:34,739
只是另一个拉链问题
Just another zipper.

1011
01:04:38,087 --> 01:04:40,453
坚持下去，我想你会获胜
Hang in there. I think you're winning.

1012
01:04:41,457 --> 01:04:43,118
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

1013
01:04:47,497 --> 01:04:50,159
她对你可真有帮助。她甚至都不能自己穿衣服
She'll be a big help to you. She can't even dress herself.

1014
01:04:50,233 --> 01:04:53,498
那就是我能帮助她的地方
我有一个绝妙的建议
-That's where I can help her.
-I have a wonderful idea:

1015
01:04:54,003 --> 01:04:57,564
你回家来。我把你的床升高。在车库里有一架梯子
You come home, I'll have your bed raised. There's a ladder in the garage.

1016
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,972
很好的尝试，母亲。只是这不一样
Nice try, Mother. It just wouldn't be the same.

1017
01:05:00,043 --> 01:05:04,844
好吧。如果你坚持呆在这里，我就不再供养你
All right, if you insist on staying here, I will not support you.

1018
01:05:06,482 --> 01:05:08,780
你要干什么？
打电话给《旧金山新闻》
-What're you doing?
-Calling the <i>Chronicle</i>.

1019
01:05:08,851 --> 01:05:10,978
弗洛伦斯・贝克拒绝帮助残疾人
Florence Baker refuses to help the handicapped.

1020
01:05:11,054 --> 01:05:14,512
我是严肃的，唐尼
那我会打电话给《纽约时报》
-I'm serious, Donnie.
-Then I'll call <i>The New York Times</i>.

1021
01:05:14,757 --> 01:05:18,750
你要怎么弄钱？你积攒的那点很快就会花光
What are you going to do for money? The little you saved must be gone now.

1022
01:05:19,896 --> 01:05:22,592
我总能拿着一个锡罐子，走遍大街
I can always walk along the streets with a tin cup.

1023
01:05:22,665 --> 01:05:25,930
现在你在使我尴尬了
不会。我会避开塞克斯百货的
-Now you're embarrassing me.
-No, I'll keep away from Saks.

1024
01:05:26,836 --> 01:05:30,932
你马上停止开玩笑，告诉我你的计划
You just stop all this joking and tell me what your plans are.

1025
01:05:31,007 --> 01:05:35,467
我计划弹唱吉他赚钱。我弹得很好。你自己说过的
I plan to sing and play the guitar. I'm pretty good. You said so yourself.

1026
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,044
我没有想到你会计划靠此为生
I had no idea you were planning to make a career of it.

1027
01:05:40,116 --> 01:05:42,448
你对你面临的困境没有一点主意吗？
Have you any idea of the competition you're facing?

1028
01:05:42,518 --> 01:05:45,043
我有跟其他人一样好的机会
I have just as good a chance as anybody else.

1029
01:05:45,121 --> 01:05:46,952
甚至更好。我有魅力
Better. I have charisma.

1030
01:05:48,057 --> 01:05:51,288
我能问一下你是怎么得出这个辉煌结论的？
May I ask how you arrived at this brilliant decision?

1031
01:05:51,661 --> 01:05:55,119
这是最基本的，我亲爱的母亲，用最基本的排除法
It's elementary, my dear Mother, by the simple process of elimination.

1032
01:05:55,198 --> 01:05:59,897
我罗列了所有我不能做的事情，像商务航空飞行
I made a long list of all the things I couldn't do, like commercial airline pilot.

1033
01:05:59,969 --> 01:06:03,735
我怀疑美环球航空公司会乐意让我驾驶他们的飞机……
I doubt that TWA would be too pleased of having me flying their planes...

1034
01:06:03,806 --> 01:06:05,603
……美联合航空或者泛美航空也不会。
...nor United or Pan Am.

1035
01:06:05,908 --> 01:06:07,136
摄影家？
Photographer?

1036
01:06:07,277 --> 01:06:10,474
绝对剔除，还有球类运动员和出租车司机
A definite out, along with ball player and cab driver.

1037
01:06:11,247 --> 01:06:12,236
斗牛士？
Matador?

1038
01:06:12,815 --> 01:06:14,942
我不看好
Didn't strike me as too promising.

1039
01:06:15,351 --> 01:06:16,579
很坦诚
Honestly.

1040
01:06:16,919 --> 01:06:18,682
我考虑过做眼科医生……
I considered becoming an eye doctor...

1041
01:06:18,755 --> 01:06:22,282
……但这就好像盲人给盲人引路
...but that would just be a case of the blind leading the blind.

1042
01:06:22,825 --> 01:06:24,816
开个玩笑，母亲
That was a little joke, Mother.

1043
01:06:26,229 --> 01:06:27,753
我说了是个小玩笑
I said it was little.

1044
01:06:28,131 --> 01:06:31,726
我猜这吉他演奏的主意是琳达・弗莱彻灌输给你的
I suppose Linda Fletcher put this guitar idea into your head.

1045
01:06:32,835 --> 01:06:34,996
你会说这是个好主意
You might say she was instrumental.

1046
01:06:35,505 --> 01:06:37,803
哦，天！
那也是个玩笑
-Oh, boy!
-That was another joke.

1047
01:06:37,874 --> 01:06:42,334
你开始嘲笑某件事。人们会把你当成女同性恋的
You got to start laughing at something. People are going to think you're a lesbian.

1048
01:06:45,081 --> 01:06:48,573
你确实变得油腔滑调了，对吗？
You certainly have picked up some colorful language, haven't you?

1049
01:06:48,651 --> 01:06:51,279
在这里你能学到每件事
好吧，我想，年青人……
-You learn everything down here.
-Yes. Well, I think, young man...

1050
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:56,381
……你学得够多了
...you have learned just about enough.

1051
01:06:56,959 --> 01:06:59,189
我几乎不认识我自己的儿子了
I hardly recognize my own son.

1052
01:06:59,262 --> 01:07:01,856
你在做什么？
我很久以前就该做的事情
-What are you doing?
-What I should've done long ago.

1053
01:07:01,931 --> 01:07:04,798
我要把你带回家
算了吧，母亲，没门
-I'm taking you home.
-Forget it, Mother. There's no way.

1054
01:07:04,867 --> 01:07:08,394
你不能一个人呆在这儿
我不是一个人。我有朋友
-You cannot stay down here alone.
-I'm not alone. I have friends.

1055
01:07:08,471 --> 01:07:12,601
你的那些聚会都是骗我的，这里没有聚会。你也没有朋友
You haven't fooled me with these parties. There are no parties. You have no friends.

1056
01:07:12,675 --> 01:07:17,738
我现在有了。本森太太
一条导盲犬也比她好
-I have now. I have Mrs. Benson.
-You'd be better off with a Seeing Eye dog.

1057
01:07:17,847 --> 01:07:20,509
那可没意思，另外，我已经有一个导盲母亲
Not as much fun. Besides, I got a Seeing Eye mother.

1058
01:07:20,583 --> 01:07:22,915
很好，而且她正要带你回家
That's right and she's taking you home.

1059
01:07:22,985 --> 01:07:25,385
本森太太还要学习怎么自己穿衣服
Mrs. Benson'll have to learn how to dress herself.

1060
01:07:25,455 --> 01:07:28,015
把行李箱放下
你要跟我回家
-Put the suitcase away.
-You're coming home with me.

1061
01:07:28,091 --> 01:07:29,956
给我行李箱
Give me that suitcase.

1062
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:33,054
它在哪里？把它给我
Where is it? Give it to me.

1063
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:38,962
给我
Give it to me.

1064
01:08:05,762 --> 01:08:09,721
妈妈，请停止对我的担忧吧
Mom, now please stop worrying about me.

1065
01:08:10,133 --> 01:08:11,327
我会好的
I'll be all right.

1066
01:08:11,401 --> 01:08:14,962
如果我的音乐事业不成功，我还可以学习法律和技术
If the music doesn't work out, I can always study law or technology.

1067
01:08:15,037 --> 01:08:17,801
现在有许多盲人可从事的工作
There are lots of things blind people can do today.

1068
01:08:17,874 --> 01:08:19,774
现在请不要再为我担忧了
Now please, stop worrying.

1069
01:08:27,049 --> 01:08:30,018
好了，我该走了，谢谢你的顺道来访
Well, I got to go. Thanks for dropping by.

1070
01:08:30,253 --> 01:08:32,244
你要去哪里？
购物
-Where are you going?
-Shopping.

1071
01:08:32,321 --> 01:08:35,586
我跟你说过了，我晚上要请本森太太吃饭
I told you, I'm having dinner in tonight, with Mrs. Benson.

1072
01:08:36,025 --> 01:08:38,391
只有我们两个
Just the two of us alone.

1073
01:08:39,228 --> 01:08:42,891
好吧，我会呆在这里直到你回来
我不要你在这里等
-Well, I'll just wait here until you get back.
-I don't want you to wait.

1074
01:08:42,965 --> 01:08:45,798
回家路上小心，我明天会打电话给你
Have a nice trip home, and I'll call you tomorrow.

1075
01:08:46,002 --> 01:08:49,267
听着，求你，我不想回家的时候还能闻到你在这里
Now, please, I don't want to smell you here when I get back.

1076
01:08:50,106 --> 01:08:52,631
晚餐之后，我猜还有一个狂欢吧
And after dinner, I suppose an orgy.

1077
01:08:53,042 --> 01:08:54,304
我希望有
I hope so.

1078
01:08:55,144 --> 01:08:59,979
不祥的事实终于显露出来：小唐尼・达克原来只是一个老淫棍！
At last the sinister truth is revealed: Little Donnie Dark is just a dirty old man!

1079
01:09:18,367 --> 01:09:20,267
本森太太
Mrs. Benson.

1080
01:09:22,071 --> 01:09:23,060
什么事？
Yes?

1081
01:09:24,707 --> 01:09:28,507
本森太太，我能给你说会儿话吗？
Mrs. Benson, might I speak to you for a moment, please?

1082
01:09:28,744 --> 01:09:32,043
我有个试镜，我马上就要走了
I have an audition and I should be leaving soon.

1083
01:09:32,114 --> 01:09:34,241
我对这个城市不了解。我常迷路
I don't know this town. I always get lost.

1084
01:09:34,317 --> 01:09:36,649
别担心，我不会耽搁你太久的
Don't worry, I'll see that you get off in time.

1085
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:40,155
请进来，坐下，我想我们可以谈一下
Please, come in, sit down. I thought we might have a little chat.

1086
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:44,057
女生之间的谈话。你想要茶还是咖啡？
Just girls, together. Can I get you coffee, tea?

1087
01:09:44,327 --> 01:09:46,955
不了，谢谢。如果刚才那个苹果还在的话……
No, thank you. But if that apple is still there.

1088
01:09:47,029 --> 01:09:48,553
我相信它还在
I'm sure it is.

1089
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,464
唐在哪里？
购物去了
-Where's Don?
-Shopping.

1090
01:09:54,103 --> 01:09:58,506
要知道，你必须非常仔细地清洗水果和蔬菜
You must be so careful to wash fruits and vegetables today, you know.

1091
01:09:59,175 --> 01:10:02,201
现在什么东西上都喷杀虫剂
They spray those insecticides all over everything.

1092
01:10:02,278 --> 01:10:05,509
我不确信这会比害虫的危害少
I'm not sure that the bugs aren't less harmful.

1093
01:10:06,315 --> 01:10:08,806
我喜欢好看和闪亮的苹果
I like apples to be nice and shiny.

1094
01:10:12,688 --> 01:10:14,849
这场景有点眼熟，像什么来着？
This reminds me of something. What is it?

1095
01:10:14,924 --> 01:10:16,221
我不知道
I have no idea.

1096
01:10:18,127 --> 01:10:22,325
你递给我苹果，又好又闪亮
You handing me the apple, nice and shiny.

1097
01:10:23,533 --> 01:10:25,330
我知道了，白雪公主
I know. Snow White.

1098
01:10:25,568 --> 01:10:28,628
记得当巫婆把有毒的苹果递给白雪公主吗？
Remember when the witch brought her the poisoned apple?

1099
01:10:29,338 --> 01:10:32,307
对不起，我不是说现在就像那个故事
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that the way it sounded.

1100
01:10:32,675 --> 01:10:34,404
我知道你不是巫婆
I know you're not a witch.

1101
01:10:34,944 --> 01:10:39,745
当然不是，而且我也知道你不是白雪公主
Of course not. And I know you're not Snow White.

1102
01:10:41,817 --> 01:10:43,284
是的，好吧
Yes, well.

1103
01:10:44,153 --> 01:10:48,783
我确信我们的谈话很愉快，我希望我能呆得更久一点……
I certainly have enjoyed our talk, and I wish I could stay longer...

1104
01:10:48,858 --> 01:10:50,382
……但是我不得不去参加试镜了
...but I do have my audition.

1105
01:10:50,459 --> 01:10:54,759
听着，我的车就停在楼下。我载你去，我们路上谈
Listen, my car is right downstairs. I'll drop you and we can talk on the way.

1106
01:10:54,997 --> 01:10:59,058
你真好，贝克太太，我做梦都想不到你这么好
You're too kind, Mrs. Baker. I wouldn't dream of imposing.

1107
01:10:59,135 --> 01:11:01,933
你别客气，我整个下午都有空
You're not imposing. I'm free the whole afternoon.

1108
01:11:02,004 --> 01:11:04,598
不用了，不管怎么说，谢谢。我要先吃一下午餐
No, thanks anyway. I have to have my lunch first.

1109
01:11:04,674 --> 01:11:06,505
我很乐意载你去吃午饭
I'd love to take you to lunch.

1110
01:11:06,576 --> 01:11:10,239
我知道最好的餐馆。他们的食物好吃极了
I know the most wonderfuI restaurant. They have the best food.

1111
01:11:10,313 --> 01:11:12,781
不了，谢谢
你喜欢烤面条吗？
-No, thanks.
-Do you like lasagna?

1112
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:15,247
天气好吗？
Is the sky blue?

1113
01:11:15,318 --> 01:11:17,878
他们用八种不同的奶酪做面条……
They make a lasagna with eight different cheeses...

1114
01:11:17,954 --> 01:11:20,149
……还有绝密酱汁
...and the sauce is a state secret.

1115
01:11:23,492 --> 01:11:26,359
本森太太，你是如何保持身材的？
How do you manage to keep your figure, Mrs. Benson?

1116
01:11:26,696 --> 01:11:29,187
我希望你别叫我本森太太了
I wish you'd stop calling me, Mrs. Benson.

1117
01:11:29,432 --> 01:11:31,900
那不是你的名字吗？本森太太
That is your name, isn't it, Mrs. Benson?

1118
01:11:32,335 --> 01:11:34,860
但是你叫出来的口气不像是你想要表达的意思
But you don't say it as though you mean it.

1119
01:11:35,137 --> 01:11:38,368
我很抱歉，也许我该叫你，吉尔？
I'm sorry. Suppose I call you, Jill.

1120
01:11:38,708 --> 01:11:41,734
这样友好多了。我会尽力表达我想说的
That's more friendly. I'll try to say it as though I mean it.

1121
01:11:41,811 --> 01:11:46,248
现在，吉尔，说说你的童年
Now, Jill, you were telling me about your childhood.

1122
01:11:47,316 --> 01:11:48,340
我的？
I was?

1123
01:11:48,651 --> 01:11:51,779
有这么多个父亲，一定很有趣
It must have been interesting, having so many fathers.

1124
01:11:51,921 --> 01:11:55,015
呃，是的，实际上是这样
Well, yes, actually, it was.

1125
01:11:56,092 --> 01:11:58,754
但是你为什么不直接问重点呢？贝克太太
But why don't you get to the point, Mrs. Baker?

1126
01:11:59,929 --> 01:12:01,658
不管怎样我知道你想问什么
I know what it is anyway.

1127
01:12:01,731 --> 01:12:02,755
是吗？
You do?

1128
01:12:03,633 --> 01:12:07,330
好吧，我知道你并不想请我吃饭，讨论我的童年……
Well, I know you didn't ask me to lunch to discuss my childhood...

1129
01:12:07,703 --> 01:12:09,796
……或者告诉我有多可爱
...or to tell me how pretty I am.

1130
01:12:10,306 --> 01:12:11,705
我很感兴趣，你……
I was interested to see...

1131
01:12:11,774 --> 01:12:14,208
……和唐尼有哪些共同点
...what you and Donnie
might have in common.

1132
01:12:14,276 --> 01:12:15,868
他非常喜欢你
He likes you very much.

1133
01:12:16,512 --> 01:12:18,412
我非常喜欢他
I like him very much.

1134
01:12:19,081 --> 01:12:22,209
他甚至是我见过的最了不起的人
He might even be the most beautiful person I ever met.

1135
01:12:23,252 --> 01:12:26,278
只要想象一下一辈子都看不见任何东西
Just imagine going through life never seeing anything.

1136
01:12:26,422 --> 01:12:30,791
看不到鲜花，或者画，甚至圣诞贺卡
Not a flower, or a painting, or even a Christmas card.

1137
01:12:32,495 --> 01:12:36,192
哇！我想死，而他却坚强地活着
Wow! I want to die, but he wants to live.

1138
01:12:36,599 --> 01:12:38,123
我意思是真正地活着
I mean really live.

1139
01:12:39,035 --> 01:12:42,436
他甚至能轻松面对。喔，他真了不起。
He can even kid about it. Wow, he's fantastic.

1140
01:12:42,672 --> 01:12:45,698
那么你会希望给予他最好的，不是吗？
Then you would want what's best for him, wouldn't you?

1141
01:12:45,808 --> 01:12:49,801
现在我们讨论到重点了。我知道这顿午餐不是免费的。
Now we're getting to it. I knew this lunch wasn't free.

1142
01:12:50,146 --> 01:12:54,139
也许我该要求他离开公寓跟你回家？
Maybe I should ask him to leave the apartment and go home with you?

1143
01:12:54,417 --> 01:12:56,476
他在家里一直很快乐，直到琳达・弗莱彻……
He was happy at home till Linda Fletcher...

1144
01:12:56,552 --> 01:12:59,385
……给他灌输了关于自己的空间的思想
...filled him with ideas about a place of his own.

1145
01:12:59,889 --> 01:13:03,552
好吧，我想你相信他只有跟你才会快乐
Well, I think that you believe that he can only be happy with you.

1146
01:13:04,193 --> 01:13:07,720
这就叫，视而不见的人才更瞎
Well, there are none so blind as those who will not see.

1147
01:13:08,097 --> 01:13:11,794
天！我能引用狄兰・托马斯和小唐尼・达克的话了
There! I can quote Dylan Thomas and Little Donnie Dark.

1148
01:13:12,501 --> 01:13:14,594
你总是会令我大为吃惊
You constantly astonish me.

1149
01:13:15,137 --> 01:13:17,662
好吧，我们――世界妇女的榜样
Well, we women of the world do that.

1150
01:13:18,574 --> 01:13:23,273
这很滑稽，你真像琳达。毫无疑问唐尼挑选女孩的标准总是一致
It's funny how like Linda you are. Donnie's certainly consistent with his girls.

1151
01:13:24,747 --> 01:13:28,706
哦，我的天，已经过3点了
我请客，服务生
-Oh, my goodness, it's after 3:00.
-I'll get the check. Waiter.

1152
01:13:28,984 --> 01:13:30,508
服务生
Waiter, please.

1153
00:00:40,601 --> 00:01:52,322
小洋葱 翻译收藏
Dianna 校对

1154
01:13:33,055 --> 01:13:36,422
我希望你不会告诉唐尼我们一起吃午饭的事情
I hope you won't tell Donnie that we had lunch together.

1155
01:13:36,659 --> 01:13:39,093
好的，但如果他问起，我不会撒谎
Okay, but if he asks, I won't lie.

1156
01:13:39,695 --> 01:13:40,923
他不会问的
He won't ask.

1157
01:13:41,964 --> 01:13:44,933
为什么你叫他唐尼？
那是他的名字
-Why do you call him, Donnie?
-Well, that's his name.

1158
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,401
难道我说的不是我想表达的意思吗？
他讨厌被叫做唐尼
-Don't I say it as though I mean it?
-He hates being called, Donnie.

1159
01:13:48,471 --> 01:13:52,567
他从没说起过
当然说过，你只是没听到
-He's never mentioned it.
-Of course he has. You just don't listen.

1160
01:13:53,275 --> 01:13:56,301
充耳不闻的人才更聋
There are none so deaf as those who will not hear.

1161
01:13:57,012 --> 01:13:59,412
你可以用这种句型造出更多的句子，不是吗？
You could make up a lot of those, couldn't you?

1162
01:13:59,482 --> 01:14:02,315
不愿意走路的人才更瘸
There are none so lame as those who will not walk.

1163
01:14:03,385 --> 01:14:06,548
不愿意吃的的人才更瘦
There are none so thin as those who will not eat.

1164
01:14:07,423 --> 01:14:10,586
你是否真正坦诚地想过，独自一人住在……
Do you really honestly think that it's a good idea for Donnie...

1165
01:14:10,659 --> 01:14:12,217
……那种地方对唐尼是个好主意吗？
...to live there alone?

1166
01:14:12,294 --> 01:14:16,492
是的，我的确真正坦诚地感觉到，独自一人住在……
Yes, I really honestly feel it's a good idea for Don...

1167
01:14:16,565 --> 01:14:18,590
……任何唐想去的地方对他都是好主意
...to live wherever he wants to.

1168
01:14:19,235 --> 01:14:21,760
另外，他不是独自一人，我就在隔壁
Anyway, he's not alone. I'm right next door.

1169
01:14:22,538 --> 01:14:25,098
你会呆多久？那个公寓你会一直租下去吗？
For how long? Do you have a lease on that apartment?

1170
01:14:25,174 --> 01:14:26,198
不会
No.

1171
01:14:27,176 --> 01:14:29,804
那么如果你想，你明天就可以搬出去
Then you could move out tomorrow if you wanted to.

1172
01:14:29,879 --> 01:14:31,107
是的
That's right.

1173
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,477
你甚至不能维持一段婚姻超过六天，不是吗？
You couldn't sustain a marriage for more than six days, could you?

1174
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:36,575
我的婚姻与你无干
My marriage doesn't concern you.

1175
01:14:36,919 --> 01:14:39,410
与你也没太多关系，不是吗？
It didn't concern you much either, did it?

1176
01:14:40,689 --> 01:14:42,714
事实上，有关系
As a matter of fact, it did.

1177
01:14:42,892 --> 01:14:46,760
你是否想象过跟一个失明的男孩结婚会是什么样子的吗？
Have you thought about what marriage to a blind boy might be like?

1178
01:14:46,929 --> 01:14:49,523
即使你的母亲也没有遇到过这种情况
Even your mother has not covered that territory.

1179
01:14:49,598 --> 01:14:51,691
请不要撤上我的母亲
Just leave my mother out of this.

1180
01:15:00,176 --> 01:15:01,268
对不起
I'm sorry.

1181
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:03,901
我不知道你对你的母亲这个话题这么敏感
I didn't know you were so touchy about her.

1182
01:15:04,013 --> 01:15:06,846
我不是敏感，我不希望谈论她
I'm not touchy about her. I don't want to talk about her.

1183
01:15:06,916 --> 01:15:09,384
好吧，我们不谈她，我们谈谈你
All right, we won't. We'll talk about you.

1184
01:15:09,451 --> 01:15:13,512
你已经看到唐尼在他熟记的地方的最佳状态
You've seen Donnie at his best in that place that he's memorized.

1185
01:15:13,589 --> 01:15:17,286
他已经记住去药房要多少步，去熟食店要多少步
He's memorized how many steps to the drugstore, to the delicatessen.

1186
01:15:17,927 --> 01:15:20,327
你大概对此印象很深刻
And you were probably very impressed by that.

1187
01:15:20,396 --> 01:15:23,729
但是我见过他在陌生环境的表现。他不知道他观察到的东西
But I've seen him in strange surroundings. He didn't know I was watching.

1188
01:15:23,799 --> 01:15:26,529
我看见过他迷路。我看见过他恐慌
I've seen him lost. I've seen him panic.

1189
01:15:26,669 --> 01:15:30,070
他需要某个人一直陪着他，而不是只有6天
He needs someone who'll stay with him and not just for six days.

1190
01:15:30,172 --> 01:15:31,799
别担心。贝克太太
Stop worrying, Mrs. Baker.

1191
01:15:31,874 --> 01:15:34,968
我和唐之间不会发展到那么严重地步的
Nothing serious will develop between Don and me.

1192
01:15:35,644 --> 01:15:38,135
我不是那种性格的人
唐尼是那种性格的人
-I'm not built that way.
-Donnie is built that way.

1193
01:15:38,214 --> 01:15:40,774
哦，请别，我们只是玩一玩
Oh, please. We're just having kicks.

1194
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:42,374
玩一玩！
Kicks!

1195
01:15:42,685 --> 01:15:44,880
他和琳达・弗莱彻就是这么开始的
That's how it started with Linda Fletcher.

1196
01:15:44,954 --> 01:15:47,320
唐尼爱上她了。他也会爱上你的
Donnie fell in love with her. He will with you, too.

1197
01:15:47,389 --> 01:15:49,482
接着发生了什么事？
我不知道
-Then what happens?
-I don't know.

1198
01:15:49,558 --> 01:15:53,050
我确实知道。在你伤害到他之前停止吧
Well, I do know. Stop it now before you hurt him.

1199
01:15:53,128 --> 01:15:55,858
你呢？你没有伤害到他吗？
What about you? Aren't you hurting him?

1200
01:15:56,065 --> 01:15:58,829
我不能，我只能激怒他。你能伤害到他
I can't. I can only irritate him. You can hurt him.

1201
01:15:58,901 --> 01:16:01,768
你跟他呆得越久，伤害就会越……
The longer you stay with him, the harder it will be when....

1202
01:16:01,837 --> 01:16:04,169
听我讲，让他跟我一起回家吧
Listen to me, let him come home with me.

1203
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:06,970
跟那些当你离开不会有感觉的人玩吧
Have kicks with someone who won't feel them when you leave.

1204
01:16:07,042 --> 01:16:10,705
我不太确定你不会伤害到他。也许比任何人都严重
I'm not so sure you can't hurt him. Maybe more than anybody.

1205
01:16:10,913 --> 01:16:14,849
我想你养育一个人应得到有全部的赞誉
I think you deserve all the credit you can get for raising a marvelous guy.

1206
01:16:14,917 --> 01:16:18,444
但是养育一个儿子，甚至是失明的，不是种一生的职业
But bringing up a son, even a blind one, is not a lifetime occupation.

1207
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:19,953
你什么都不知道
You don't know anything.

1208
01:16:20,022 --> 01:16:22,582
你越是帮助他，你越会伤害到他
The more you help him, the more you hurt him.

1209
01:16:22,658 --> 01:16:26,253
给他所需要的最大限度的自信的人……
It was Linda Fletcher, not you, who gave him what he needed most...

1210
01:16:26,328 --> 01:16:28,057
……是琳达・弗莱彻，而不是你
...confidence in himself.

1211
01:16:30,032 --> 01:16:31,966
你总是用消极的态度看待他……
You're always dwelling on the negative...

1212
01:16:32,034 --> 01:16:34,093
……总是给他需要的，从不给他所想要的
...always what he needs, never what he wants...

1213
01:16:34,169 --> 01:16:36,569
……总是想他不能做什么，从不想他能做什么
...always what he can't do, never what he can.

1214
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:39,506
他的音乐你有何评价？你是否听过他写的歌？
What about his music? Have you heard the songs he wrote?

1215
01:16:39,575 --> 01:16:41,907
我敢打赌你甚至不知道他在写歌
I'll bet you didn't even know he writes songs.

1216
01:16:41,977 --> 01:16:44,070
你对我的看法或许绝对正确
You might be dead right about me.

1217
01:16:44,146 --> 01:16:47,604
我不是唐的理想女孩，但是我知道一件事情……
I'm not the ideal girl for Don, but I know one thing...

1218
01:16:47,683 --> 01:16:48,911
……你也不是！
...neither are you!

1219
01:16:48,984 --> 01:16:51,282
如果我要告诉什么人回家去……
And if I'm going to tell anybody
to go home...

1220
01:16:51,353 --> 01:16:54,481
……那个人就会是你，贝克太太！你，回家去！
...it's going to be you, Mrs. Baker! You, go home!

1221
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,190
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

1222
01:17:32,261 --> 01:17:35,389
我在找几张蜡纸包肉
I'm looking for some wax paper to wrap this meat in.

1223
01:17:35,464 --> 01:17:38,592
母亲，这里没有蜡纸
这肉看起来糟糕透了
-There is no wax paper, Mother.
-The meat looks terrible.

1224
01:17:38,901 --> 01:17:41,927
没人请你看
现在几点了？
-Nobody asked you to look at it.
-What time is it?

1225
01:17:47,009 --> 01:17:48,499
10点20
Twenty of ten.

1226
01:17:48,944 --> 01:17:50,206
10点20？
Twenty of ten?

1227
01:17:50,279 --> 01:17:53,339
我知道。她靠不住，也不可信。还有什么新鲜的？
I know. She is unreliable and undependable. What else is new?

1228
01:17:53,415 --> 01:17:56,578
你是约7点半的，我听你说过
You did say 7:30. I heard you.

1229
01:17:57,987 --> 01:18:01,514
为什么你不换一件衬衫呢？穿我带给你的那件新的
Why don't you change your shirt? Put on one of the new ones I bought you.

1230
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:03,285
因为我喜欢这件
Because I like this one.

1231
01:18:03,559 --> 01:18:08,292
你知道，你没必要闲待着。
我等到她回来就走
-You don't have to hang around, you know.
-I'll just wait here until she gets back.

1232
01:18:08,364 --> 01:18:10,992
我不会妨碍你的狂欢的。我告诉过你了
I won't interfere with your orgy. I told you that.

1233
01:18:11,066 --> 01:18:12,829
不，我告诉你的
No, I told you that.

1234
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:17,261
<i>"I knew the day you met me</i>

1235
01:18:18,107 --> 01:18:21,076
<i>"I could love you if you let me</i>

1236
01:18:21,977 --> 01:18:24,775
<i>"Though you touched my cheek and</i>

1237
01:18:24,947 --> 01:18:28,644
<i>"Said how easy you'd forget me</i>

1238
01:18:29,218 --> 01:18:35,350
<i>"You said, butterflies are free"</i>

1239
01:18:36,191 --> 01:18:37,988
请把它关掉，妈妈
Please, turn that off, Mom.

1240
01:18:38,427 --> 01:18:40,224
那首歌是你写的吗？
Is that the song you wrote?

1241
01:18:40,362 --> 01:18:42,193
是的，你怎么知道我写歌？
Yeah. How'd you know I wrote that?

1242
01:18:43,632 --> 01:18:45,463
我不知道。我只是问问
I didn't. I just asked you.

1243
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:49,369
真好听，相当好
It's good. Pretty.

1244
01:18:49,438 --> 01:18:50,700
<i>"On that velvet"</i>

1245
01:18:50,773 --> 01:18:52,502
你意思是说它相当好听
You mean it's pretty good.

1246
01:18:52,674 --> 01:18:56,940
不，我意思是它好听，也可爱
No. I mean good and pretty.

1247
01:18:57,012 --> 01:18:58,240
哦，哇！
Oh, wow!

1248
01:18:59,281 --> 01:19:01,841
你猜她在哪里？
Where do you suppose she is?

1249
01:19:02,351 --> 01:19:06,845
她大概还在试镜
用8小时？我担心她
-She's probably still auditioning.
-For eight hours? I'm worried about her.

1250
01:19:06,922 --> 01:19:09,755
你在担心吉尔？
难道你没有吗？
-You're worried about Jill?
-Aren't you?

1251
01:19:11,593 --> 01:19:13,185
你怎么了
Something's come over you.

1252
01:19:13,262 --> 01:19:15,787
你先是喜欢我的歌，现在你担心吉尔
You like my song, now you're worried about Jill.

1253
01:19:15,864 --> 01:19:17,889
你没有提到我出门花了几个小时
You haven't mentioned my coming home for hours.

1254
01:19:17,966 --> 01:19:20,491
你还好吧？
我看起来不好吗？
-Are you all right?
-Don't I seem all right?

1255
01:19:20,636 --> 01:19:24,163
不，你的表现不像是超级妈妈
No. You're not behaving like Super Mom.

1256
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:28,676
接着你就会告诉我你喜欢吉尔
我不讨厌她
-Then you'll be telling me you like Jill.
-I don't dislike her.

1257
01:19:28,744 --> 01:19:31,577
我只是希望她是不同类型的女孩
I just wish that she were a different sort of girl.

1258
01:19:31,647 --> 01:19:34,480
她是特别的女孩。这就是你不喜欢的原因
She's a different girl. That's what you don't like.

1259
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:37,246
当我像她那种年纪的时候，守时意味着某种品德
When I was her age, punctuality meant something.

1260
01:19:37,486 --> 01:19:38,475
意味着什么品德？
What did it mean?

1261
01:19:38,554 --> 01:19:42,320
如果我参加晚宴将迟到3个小时，我会先打电话解释
If I were going to be three hours late for dinner, I'd call and explain.

1262
01:19:42,391 --> 01:19:43,949
你从来不会迟到3小时
You'd never be three hours late.

1263
01:19:44,026 --> 01:19:47,052
不，我当然不会
你会提前一个月
-No, I certainly would not.
-You'd be a month early.

1264
01:19:49,031 --> 01:19:50,623
也许她迷路了
Maybe she's lost.

1265
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:53,495
她说她在旧金山常常迷路
She said she always loses her way around San Francisco.

1266
01:19:53,569 --> 01:19:55,696
任何一辆出租车世纪都会载她回家
Any cab driver can bring her home.

1267
01:19:56,538 --> 01:19:59,507
她从来不说她迷路
噢，是的，她跟我说过
-She never said she loses her way around.
-She said it to me.

1268
01:19:59,575 --> 01:20:01,941
如果她跟你说过，我会听到的
If she said it to you, I'd have heard it.

1269
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:04,410
好吧，我猜是在你出去后说的
Well, I guess it was after you went out.

1270
01:20:04,646 --> 01:20:07,171
我出去的时候她在这里？
据我看是的
-Was she here while I was out?
-It seems to me she was.

1271
01:20:07,249 --> 01:20:07,908
为什么？
Why?

1272
01:20:07,983 --> 01:20:10,315
按例，她想让人帮她把衣服的拉链拉上
The usual, she wanted her dress zipped up.

1273
01:20:10,385 --> 01:20:13,320
这个我在的时候你就做了，母亲
她是顺便来访
-You did that while I was here, Mother.
-She dropped by.

1274
01:20:13,388 --> 01:20:15,754
她在这里呆了几分钟
你们都谈些什么？
-She was here for a minute.
-What'd you talk about?

1275
01:20:15,824 --> 01:20:18,952
我不记得了
你却记得她常迷路
-I don't remember.
-You remember she loses her way.

1276
01:20:19,027 --> 01:20:21,222
还有别的吗？
有什么问题吗？
-What else?
-What does it matter?

1277
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:24,629
如果没有问题，就告诉我！
唐尼，不要对我大喊大叫的
-If it doesn't matter, then tell me!
-Donnie, please don't shout at me.

1278
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:26,793
我们谈论了白雪公主
We talked about Snow White.

1279
01:20:28,504 --> 01:20:29,869
白雪公主？
Snow White?

1280
01:20:30,506 --> 01:20:32,997
和七个小矮人？那个白雪公主？
And the Seven Dwarfs? That Snow White?

1281
01:20:33,075 --> 01:20:34,542
还有其他的白雪公主吗？
Is there any other?

1282
01:20:34,843 --> 01:20:36,606
你们为什么谈起她？
Why were you talking about her?

1283
01:20:36,678 --> 01:20:39,511
我们谈论白雪公主有什么不妥吗？
What's the difference if we were talking about Snow White?

1284
01:20:39,581 --> 01:20:41,845
我们没有说她的坏话
We didn't say anything bad about her.

1285
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:45,249
我不希望你们在我不在的时候谈论我的朋友
I don't want you talking to my friends when I'm not around.

1286
01:20:45,554 --> 01:20:47,249
我会记住的
I'll make a note of that.

1287
01:20:54,696 --> 01:20:56,061
唐尼？
Donnie?

1288
01:20:56,732 --> 01:20:59,132
是不是琳达・弗莱彻给你了自信？
Did Linda Fletcher give you confidence?

1289
01:21:01,970 --> 01:21:04,871
你非常清楚她给了我什么，别试图开玩笑
You know damn well what she gave me, don't try to be funny.

1290
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:08,842
我没有试图开玩笑。她是不是也给你了自信？
I wasn't trying to be funny. Did she also give you confidence?

1291
01:21:08,944 --> 01:21:10,002
是的
Yes.

1292
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:12,504
我呢？
Didn't I?

1293
01:21:14,316 --> 01:21:15,681
你给了我帮助
You gave me help.

1294
01:21:16,718 --> 01:21:19,915
我总是想得太长远
不可避免的
-I always thought one led to the other.
-Not necessarily.

1295
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:25,153
为什么你甚至不愿意告诉我你不愿意被叫做唐尼？
Why didn't you ever tell me that you don't like to be called Donnie?

1296
01:21:25,961 --> 01:21:28,054
我告诉过你上千遍了
I told you a thousand times.

1297
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:31,361
我当然记得我听了上千遍的事情
I'd certainly remember something I've heard a thousand times.

1298
01:21:32,868 --> 01:21:35,268
好吧，也许我只说了999遍
Well, maybe it was only 999.

1299
01:21:36,205 --> 01:21:39,003
叫唐尼有什么不好？
它让我想起唐尼・达克
-What's wrong with Donnie?
-It reminds me of Donnie Dark.

1300
01:21:39,074 --> 01:21:40,701
那有什么不好？
What's wrong with that?

1301
01:21:41,476 --> 01:21:42,773
你杜撰的
You work on it.

1302
01:21:43,779 --> 01:21:47,579
那你喜欢被叫做什么？我会试着记住的
What would you like to be called? I'll try to remember.

1303
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:51,283
唐。唐纳德。你可以叫我赛巴斯蒂安，或者欧文
Don. Donald. You can call me, Sebastian, or Irving.

1304
01:21:51,353 --> 01:21:53,253
我都不介意，除了唐尼
I don't care. Anything, but Donnie.

1305
01:21:53,322 --> 01:21:56,382
我当然不会叫你塞巴斯蒂安，或者欧文
I'm certainly not going to call you Sebastian or Irving.

1306
01:21:56,458 --> 01:21:59,188
我会试着记住叫你唐
I'll try to remember to call you Don.

1307
01:22:03,432 --> 01:22:04,797
她回来了
She's back.

1308
01:22:05,367 --> 01:22:07,164
她会在这里呆几分钟
She'll be here in a minute.

1309
01:22:07,436 --> 01:22:08,630
你可以走了，妈妈
You can go, Mom.

1310
01:22:08,704 --> 01:22:11,673
有个男人跟她一块儿
不要在门上偷听了
-There's a man with her.
-Stop listening at the door.

1311
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:12,707
我听不到任何声音
I can't hear anything.

1312
01:22:12,774 --> 01:22:15,402
他们一定在起居室，有个男人和她一起
They must be in the living room. There's a man with her.

1313
01:22:15,477 --> 01:22:16,944
也许是她的收音机
probably her radio.

1314
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:20,073
她为什么跟收音机谈笑？
Why would she be laughing and talking with a radio?

1315
01:22:20,148 --> 01:22:23,379
请离开那里
我走开了
-Please come away from there.
-I am away from there.

1316
01:22:25,354 --> 01:22:28,687
请进
嗨，我回来了
-Come in.
-Hi. I'm back.

1317
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:30,881
我带拉尔夫・桑多一起回来了
I brought Ralph Santori with me.

1318
01:22:31,593 --> 01:22:33,493
贝克太太，你还在这里
Mrs. Baker, you're still here.

1319
01:22:35,264 --> 01:22:37,562
唐，这位是拉尔夫・桑多。我告诉过你
Don, this is Ralph Santori. I told you about him.

1320
01:22:37,633 --> 01:22:39,624
他是这出戏的导演
很高兴见到你
-He's directing the play.
-Glad to know you.

1321
01:22:39,701 --> 01:22:43,501
嗨，唐
这位是唐的母亲，贝克太太
-Hi, Don.
-And this is Don's mother, Mrs. Baker.

1322
01:22:44,106 --> 01:22:45,835
你好，贝克太太
How do you do, Mrs. Baker.

1323
01:22:45,907 --> 01:22:48,637
唐，我把你的事情都告诉拉尔夫，他非常渴望要见到你
Don, I told Ralph all about you. He's dying to meet you.

1324
01:22:48,710 --> 01:22:52,237
吉尔告诉我，你知道，你是如何……
Jill told me, you know, how with it you are.

1325
01:22:52,314 --> 01:22:55,374
对于某些，某些看不见东西的人，你是多么擅长
How adept you are for someone who's, for someone who can't see.

1326
01:22:55,450 --> 01:22:58,112
你可以直接说失明，拉尔夫。这个词也在我的词汇表里
You can say blind, Ralph. It's in my vocabulary, too.

1327
01:22:58,186 --> 01:23:00,518
我应该知道的，吉尔告诉过我了
I should have known. You know, Jill told me.

1328
01:23:00,589 --> 01:23:03,752
她告诉我你生活乐观
拉尔夫，你没必要这么大声
-She said you had no hang-ups!
-Ralph, you don't have to shout.

1329
01:23:03,825 --> 01:23:05,850
桑多先生，我的儿子不是聋子
Mr. Santori, my son is not deaf.

1330
01:23:07,062 --> 01:23:08,825
对不起
这种事情总会有的
-Sorry.
-It happens all the time.

1331
01:23:08,897 --> 01:23:11,365
人们总是译为如果你是盲人，同时也会是个聋子
People think if you can't see, you can't hear.

1332
01:23:11,433 --> 01:23:14,095
他的听力比我们强
没有
-He can hear better than we can.
-No, I can't.

1333
01:23:14,803 --> 01:23:16,532
还有嗅觉也很灵敏
And what a sense of smell.

1334
01:23:17,272 --> 01:23:20,764
在我离开之前，我能为你安排些什么吗？
我们已经吃过晚饭了
-Can I fix you something before I leave?
-We already had dinner.

1335
01:23:20,909 --> 01:23:23,275
不过我不会介意来一小杯咖啡
I wouldn't mind a little cup of coffee.

1336
01:23:25,647 --> 01:23:28,343
吉尔，你答应来这里吃晚餐的
You were expected here for dinner, Jill.

1337
01:23:30,786 --> 01:23:33,812
唐，对不起
没关系
-Don, I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1338
01:23:37,626 --> 01:23:39,651
每件事情都太完美了
Everything's so beautiful.

1339
01:23:40,395 --> 01:23:41,384
蜡烛
Candles.

1340
01:23:42,664 --> 01:23:43,824
我们的鲜花
Our flowers.

1341
01:23:48,236 --> 01:23:51,034
对了，那是我给你的
Well, that's me for you.

1342
01:23:51,606 --> 01:23:53,130
我几乎都忘记了
I completely forgot.

1343
01:23:53,308 --> 01:23:56,106
我们参加这个聚会，庆祝，我们喝了……
We went to this party to celebrate and we drank...

1344
01:23:56,178 --> 01:23:58,339
……一整瓶的香槟或者其他的什么
...a bottle of champagne or whatever.

1345
01:23:58,413 --> 01:24:01,382
那是勃艮第起泡酒
你得到了那个角色？
-It was sparkling burgundy.
-Then you got the part?

1346
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:04,881
是也不是。我没有扮演妻子
Yes and no. I'm not playing the wife.

1347
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:09,216
你扮演同性恋者？
不，演她的秘书
-Are you playing the homosexual?
-No, his secretary.

1348
01:24:09,291 --> 01:24:11,623
是个小角色，但是我有一场好戏
It's a small part, but I have one good scene.

1349
01:24:11,693 --> 01:24:13,388
她试镜非常好。伙计，我为他而自豪
She gave a great audition. Man, was I proud of her.

1350
01:24:15,397 --> 01:24:17,297
你紧张吗？
我吗？
-Were you nervous?
-Was I?

1351
01:24:17,599 --> 01:24:20,534
没有对白或其他什么的，但是你能想象……
It wasn't the reading or anything, but can you imagine...

1352
01:24:20,602 --> 01:24:24,265
……完全赤裸地站在所有人面前
...having to stand there in front of those people completely naked?

1353
01:24:25,907 --> 01:24:28,307
对不起，我打破了一个杯子
I'm sorry. I broke a cup.

1354
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:30,207
需要帮忙吗？
Can I help you?

1355
01:24:30,312 --> 01:24:33,076
不，谢谢，已经全破了
No, thank you. It's already broken.

1356
01:24:33,849 --> 01:24:37,307
对不起，多少杯咖啡？
我不要
-Sorry. How many coffees?
-I don't want any.

1357
01:24:37,786 --> 01:24:39,014
我也不要
None for me.

1358
01:24:42,357 --> 01:24:44,757
为什么吉尔要裸体试镜？
Why did Jill have to be naked for the audition?

1359
01:24:44,826 --> 01:24:47,420
在这出戏中有许多裸体镜头
There's a lot of nudity involved in this play.

1360
01:24:47,496 --> 01:24:51,592
我们不得不看看演员的身材。你瞧，视觉在这里是非常重要的
We had to see the actors bodies. You see, the visual here is very important.

1361
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:55,397
我希望你不介意我刚才说的
不，一点也不
-I hope you don't mind my saying that.
-No, not at all.

1362
01:24:56,138 --> 01:24:58,606
桑多先生，你要什么样的咖啡
How do you take your coffee, Mr. Santori?

1363
01:24:58,940 --> 01:25:00,066
黑咖啡就行
Just black.

1364
01:25:00,509 --> 01:25:03,103
我不想让别人叫我假正经
I don't think anyone could call me a prude.

1365
01:25:03,578 --> 01:25:06,706
我倒想看看他们会不会
I'd like to see them try.

1366
01:25:08,617 --> 01:25:12,610
好吧，原先我恨完全赤裸的这个主意
Well, at first I hated the idea of getting completely undressed...

1367
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:15,579
……但是那里大约有20或30名演员……
...but there were like 20 or 30 actors...

1368
01:25:15,657 --> 01:25:19,423
……在我周围，全部赤裸，而我是唯一一个穿着衣服的
...all around me, all naked, and I was the only one with clothes on.

1369
01:25:20,028 --> 01:25:22,826
你有什么感觉？
热，到处都热
-How would you feel?
-Warm, all over.

1370
01:25:22,898 --> 01:25:25,230
我就在观众席上，跟编剧和制作人坐一起
I was out front with my writer and my producer.

1371
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:28,667
我们看到吉尔脱光的那一瞬间，我们就知道她不适合领衔
The minute we saw Jill naked, we knew she wasn't right for the lead.

1372
01:25:28,737 --> 01:25:33,606
桑多先生，告诉我任何有关这部戏的故事
Tell me, Mr. Santori, is there any story connected with this play...

1373
01:25:33,675 --> 01:25:35,199
……或者是否是值得期待的？
...or is that too much to hope for?

1374
01:25:35,277 --> 01:25:37,575
这是一个非常激动人心的故事，贝克太太。
It's a very dramatic story, Mrs. Baker.

1375
01:25:37,646 --> 01:25:39,113
故事的结尾我死了
I die in the end.

1376
01:25:39,448 --> 01:25:40,540
肺炎？
Pneumonia?

1377
01:25:41,716 --> 01:25:45,049
吉尔的出场将会是最狂野的，他们在任何舞台上都看不到的
Jill's scene will be the wildest thing they've seen on any stage.

1378
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:48,021
在事业上我能把这件事情做的比任何人都好
I can do this thing better than anyone in the business.

1379
01:25:48,089 --> 01:25:50,990
她将躺在那里，裸体……
She'll be lying there, naked...

1380
01:25:51,059 --> 01:25:53,186
……死于毒品过量
...dying of an overdose of heroin.

1381
01:25:53,962 --> 01:25:57,557
她痛苦不安，她躺在舞台上扭动着身体
Now she's in agony and she's writhing across the stage on her back...

1382
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:59,827
……精神混乱，尖叫
...delirious, screaming.

1383
01:26:00,302 --> 01:26:02,930
你觉得公众真的需要这个？
Do you think the public really needs this?

1384
01:26:03,271 --> 01:26:06,001
你开玩笑？他们爱死这些了
Are you kidding? They're dying for it.

1385
01:26:06,274 --> 01:26:08,572
我讨论的是有思想的公众……
I'm talking about the thinking public...

1386
01:26:08,643 --> 01:26:12,101
……而不是在希尔斯波路的那些古板的主妇
...not all those little tight-assed matrons up in Hillsborough.

1387
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:24,320
我说错了什么吗？
Have I said something wrong?

1388
01:26:24,693 --> 01:26:27,161
别在意，桑多先生
Pick anything, Mr. Santori.

1389
01:26:28,230 --> 01:26:31,199
拉尔夫，贝克太太住在希尔斯波路
Ralph, Mrs. Baker lives in Hillsborough.

1390
01:26:40,909 --> 01:26:41,898
好吧
Well.

1391
01:26:46,381 --> 01:26:48,110
在场者除外
Present company excepted.

1392
01:26:48,783 --> 01:26:50,045
那不普遍吗？
Isn't that the rule?

1393
01:26:50,118 --> 01:26:52,279
我不希望成为例外，谢谢
I don't wish to be excepted, thank you.

1394
01:26:52,387 --> 01:26:54,947
告诉我，你的戏名字叫什么？
Tell me, what is the name of your play?

1395
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:57,251
叫《做直到其他》
It's called <i>Do Unto Others</i>.

1396
01:26:57,325 --> 01:26:59,850
我必须也把这记下来
I must make a note of that, too.

1397
01:27:00,095 --> 01:27:03,189
你会喜欢这出戏的，贝克太太，如果你给一个机会的话
You might like it, Mrs. Baker, if you just gave it a chance.

1398
01:27:03,265 --> 01:27:05,426
你知道，要用开放的眼光看待
You know, saw it with an open mind.

1399
01:27:07,202 --> 01:27:09,796
妈妈自从《音乐之声》之后就不再喜欢别的戏了
Mom hasn't liked anything since <i>The Sound of Music</i>.

1400
01:27:09,871 --> 01:27:14,934
我想没有希尔斯波路的支持，我们能够取得成功
I think we might be able to make it without the support of Hillsborough.

1401
01:27:15,143 --> 01:27:16,110
好
Good.

1402
01:27:16,177 --> 01:27:19,510
因为我不会期望轻浮的小妇人的支持
Because I wouldn't count on the support of this giddy little matron.

1403
01:27:19,581 --> 01:27:23,915
我不打算花钱去看裸体，猥亵和堕落的东西
I don't intend to pay to see nudity, obscenity and degeneracy.

1404
01:27:23,985 --> 01:27:26,476
这些都是生活的一部分
These things are all a part of life.

1405
01:27:26,555 --> 01:27:28,045
我知道，桑多先生
I know, Mr. Santori.

1406
01:27:28,156 --> 01:27:29,521
拉肚子也是生活的一部分……
So is diarrhea...

1407
01:27:29,891 --> 01:27:32,587
……但是我不会把它归类成娱乐
...but I wouldn't classify it as entertainment.

1408
01:27:34,162 --> 01:27:36,062
我想我们最好走了
I think we'd better get going.

1409
01:27:36,131 --> 01:27:38,531
你收拾行李需要花多长时间？
How long will it take you to get packed?

1410
01:27:39,034 --> 01:27:40,729
不用太长，我只有两个包
Not long. I only have two bags.

1411
01:27:40,802 --> 01:27:43,168
你收拾的时候，我会弄点吃的……
I'll pick up some food while you're packing...

1412
01:27:43,238 --> 01:27:45,263
……然后我在车里等你
...and I'll meet you at the car.

1413
01:27:45,574 --> 01:27:47,064
你要去别的地方？
You going somewhere?

1414
01:27:48,276 --> 01:27:52,144
我没告诉你吗？我搬去跟拉尔夫一起住。我想我提到过了
Didn't I tell you? I'm moving in with Ralph. I thought I mentioned it.

1415
01:27:52,213 --> 01:27:54,681
不，你没有
No, you didn't.

1416
01:27:54,749 --> 01:27:57,274
好吧，这个地方太破了
Well, this place is so tacky.

1417
01:27:57,352 --> 01:28:00,583
拉尔夫认为如果我搬去跟他住会好一点
那是你的主意
-Ralph thought it'd be good if I moved in.
-It was your idea.

1418
01:28:00,655 --> 01:28:03,749
不管是谁的主意，反正是个好主意
It doesn't matter whose idea it was, it was a good one.

1419
01:28:04,426 --> 01:28:07,486
拉尔夫有一套非常棒的小公寓。你可以来看看
Ralph has a terrific studio apartment. Wait till you see it.

1420
01:28:07,562 --> 01:28:09,723
我们希望你能来参观。任何时候都可以
We want you to come over, whenever you like.

1421
01:28:09,798 --> 01:28:12,289
如果你有空，尽管过来。是吧，拉尔夫？
If you're alone, just come on over. Right, Ralph?

1422
01:28:12,367 --> 01:28:13,334
是的
Right.

1423
01:28:13,802 --> 01:28:15,827
我告诉过你会喜欢唐的
I told you you'd like Don.

1424
01:28:16,004 --> 01:28:19,030
我们在那里会过得非常愉快，你会喜欢拉尔夫的
We'll have groovy times over there. You'll love Ralph.

1425
01:28:19,174 --> 01:28:20,471
他的兴趣和我们一样
He's one of us.

1426
01:28:20,642 --> 01:28:23,270
我希望你能看到他，他有一张不同寻常的脸
I wish you could see him. He has a great face.

1427
01:28:24,412 --> 01:28:26,846
拉尔夫，让唐摸摸你的脸
Ralph, let Don feel your face.

1428
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:30,748
他能通过触摸你的脸，得知你长什么样
He can tell what you look like by feeling your face.

1429
01:28:30,819 --> 01:28:32,081
去吧，唐
Go ahead, Don.

1430
01:28:32,387 --> 01:28:33,979
他不想去
He doesn't want to.

1431
01:28:42,297 --> 01:28:44,663
好吧，和你见面很愉快，唐
Well, it's been great meeting you, Don.

1432
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,124
我希望能很快再见到你
See you soon, I hope.

1433
01:28:49,404 --> 01:28:51,599
贝克太太，和你见面很愉快
It was nice meeting you, Mrs. Baker.

1434
01:28:51,873 --> 01:28:53,807
如果我冒犯了你，我很抱歉
I apologize if I offended you.

1435
01:28:54,242 --> 01:28:58,201
没关系，桑多先生。我确信这不会再发生了
That's all right, Mr. Santori. I assure you it won't happen again.

1436
01:29:25,306 --> 01:29:27,831
我在走之前会过来道别的
I'll stop in to say goodbye before I leave.

1437
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:46,224
妈妈？
Mom?

1438
01:29:49,364 --> 01:29:51,355
妈妈，你在吗？
在
-Mom, are you here?
-Yes.

1439
01:29:53,802 --> 01:29:55,997
我有些事情想告诉你
I have something I want to tell you.

1440
01:29:56,371 --> 01:29:57,963
糟糕的事情吗？
Is it something awful?

1441
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:01,134
不，你会喜欢的，但是你最好先坐下
No, you'll like it, but you'd better sit down.

1442
01:30:01,209 --> 01:30:02,369
我坐下了
I'm sitting.

1443
01:30:04,879 --> 01:30:06,278
我想回家
I want to go home.

1444
01:30:08,216 --> 01:30:10,241
你去开车，我会收拾行李
You get the car and I'll pack.

1445
01:30:13,188 --> 01:30:15,247
你听到了吗？
听到了
-Did you hear me?
-Yes.

1446
01:30:15,890 --> 01:30:17,721
你为什么不说点什么？
Why don't you say something?

1447
01:30:17,926 --> 01:30:19,621
我想说
I intend to.

1448
01:30:19,894 --> 01:30:21,691
我正在整理思绪
I'm collecting my thoughts.

1449
01:30:21,963 --> 01:30:25,194
好吧，到车上再说。我不会很久的
Well, do that while you get the car. I won't be long.

1450
01:30:25,934 --> 01:30:27,196
只要几分钟
Just a minute.

1451
01:30:28,369 --> 01:30:31,395
我想我们因该谈谈
谈谈这件事吗？
-I think we should talk about it.
-Talk about it?

1452
01:30:31,906 --> 01:30:33,498
那不是你所希望的？
Isn't that what you wanted?

1453
01:30:33,575 --> 01:30:35,668
那不是你来的原因吗？
Isn't that why you came here?

1454
01:30:35,744 --> 01:30:37,939
是的
哪还有什么好讨论的？
-Yes.
-Then what's to talk about?

1455
01:30:38,146 --> 01:30:42,139
你说这里不是白金汉宫，你说我住在老鼠洞里
You said it isn't Buckingham Palace. You said I'm living in a rat hole.

1456
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:45,217
你说这是泰姬陵
And you said it's the Taj Mahal.

1457
01:30:45,453 --> 01:30:47,751
你是说你不想让我回家吗？
Are you saying you don't want me to come home?

1458
01:30:47,822 --> 01:30:48,652
不
No.

1459
01:30:49,090 --> 01:30:52,355
我只是说我们该讨论一下这件事。把旅行包放下
I'm only saying we should talk about it. Now put the bag down.

1460
01:30:52,427 --> 01:30:54,725
母亲，我要回家！
放下！
-I'm coming home, Mother!
-Put it down!

1461
01:31:00,168 --> 01:31:02,227
请不要误解我
Please don't misunderstand me.

1462
01:31:02,437 --> 01:31:04,428
我想这个地方太可怕了
I think this place is dreadful.

1463
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:08,167
我怀疑我的真实意愿。但是我没有选择住这里，你选择了
I doubt I ever will. But I didn't choose to live here. You did.

1464
01:31:08,243 --> 01:31:10,837
你迫不及待地要一个你自己的空间
You couldn't wait to get a place of your own.

1465
01:31:10,912 --> 01:31:13,039
你搬到这里，现在你想离开
You rushed into this, now you want out.

1466
01:31:13,114 --> 01:31:15,139
我想我们该谈谈这件事
I think we should talk about it.

1467
01:31:15,316 --> 01:31:17,944
这难道不可笑吗？你和我的想法完全正确……
Isn't it funny how you and I think exactly alike...

1468
01:31:18,019 --> 01:31:20,010
……只是从来不在同时
...only never at the same time.

1469
01:31:30,098 --> 01:31:31,998
妈妈，我做不到
I can't make it, Mom.

1470
01:31:32,934 --> 01:31:35,198
我只是知道我无法做到
I just know I'm not going to make it.

1471
01:31:36,604 --> 01:31:37,468
为什么？
Why?

1472
01:31:38,106 --> 01:31:40,336
因为一个女孩离开你了？
Because a girl has walked out on you?

1473
01:31:40,408 --> 01:31:44,310
两个女孩。别忘了琳达
那就会有10个女孩
-Two girls. Let's don't forget Linda.
-And it could be 10 girls.

1474
01:31:44,379 --> 01:31:46,939
你知道，女孩们也会离开视力正常的男人
Girls walk out on sighted men, too, you know.

1475
01:31:47,015 --> 01:31:49,176
你以为那样会让我感觉好些吗？
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

1476
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:52,344
我希望会让你不再自责
It's supposed to make you stop feeling sorry for yourself.

1477
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:56,083
你过去从来没有自责过，现在也不要
You haven't felt sorry for yourself before, please don't start now.

1478
01:31:57,258 --> 01:31:59,749
你会遇到许多女孩
You're going to meet so many girls.

1479
01:31:59,828 --> 01:32:03,389
终有一天你会遇见能和你保持永久关系的女孩
One day you'll meet one who's capable of a permanent relationship.

1480
01:32:03,464 --> 01:32:05,659
吉尔不是。她了解她自己
Jill isn't. She knows this herself.

1481
01:32:09,037 --> 01:32:13,497
我真的认为此时你最好留在这里
I really think that you're better off staying here for right now.

1482
01:32:13,808 --> 01:32:16,470
我不想让你带着挫败和沮丧的心情回家
I don't want you coming home discouraged and defeated.

1483
01:32:16,544 --> 01:32:18,535
你有你的音乐
天！
-You've got your music.
-Christ!

1484
01:32:18,613 --> 01:32:22,014
就一次，你就不能意识到，我不是小唐尼・达克？
For once, will you get it into your head I'm not Little Donnie Dark?

1485
01:32:22,083 --> 01:32:25,018
你说的很对，该死，我是灰心了，我是挫败了！
You're goddamn right I'm discouraged. I am defeated!

1486
01:32:26,154 --> 01:32:27,246
结束了
It's over.

1487
01:32:28,957 --> 01:32:31,448
你还记得唐尼・达克的第一个故事吗？
Do you remember the first Donnie Dark story?

1488
01:32:32,627 --> 01:32:33,651
不
No.

1489
01:32:34,462 --> 01:32:35,986
你那时5岁
You were five years old.

1490
01:32:36,064 --> 01:32:38,430
我们在太浩湖避暑
We were spending the summer at Lake Tahoe.

1491
01:32:38,499 --> 01:32:39,693
爸爸把你带进湖里
Dad took you into the lake.

1492
01:32:39,834 --> 01:32:42,860
那是第一次你走进比鱼缸更深的水里
It was first time you'd been in water deeper than your bathtub.

1493
01:32:42,937 --> 01:32:46,805
你吓坏了，整个加利福利亚都能听到你的尖叫声
You were terrified. They could hear you screaming all over California.

1494
01:32:46,975 --> 01:32:50,035
爸爸把你抱出，我把你抱上床。你还在发抖
Dad brought you in and I put you to bed. You trembled for hours.

1495
01:32:50,111 --> 01:32:52,443
那个晚上我给你讲了关于一个盲童的故事……
That night I told you a story about a blind boy...

1496
01:32:52,513 --> 01:32:54,743
……他能游过海洋，与海豚交谈
...who could swim the seas, and talk to dolphins.

1497
01:32:54,816 --> 01:32:56,943
海豚告诉他，敌人的潜艇……
The dolphins told him about the enemy submarines...

1498
01:32:57,018 --> 01:32:59,418
……打算要破坏美国海军……
...that were coming to destroy the U.S. Navy...

1499
01:32:59,487 --> 01:33:02,422
……唐尼・达克游回岸边，及时地拯救了美国海军
...and Donnie Dark swam ashore, in time to save them.

1500
01:33:03,191 --> 01:33:04,453
都是废话
A lot of crap.

1501
01:33:06,027 --> 01:33:08,621
第二天你学会了游泳
The next day you learned to swim.

1502
01:33:09,697 --> 01:33:13,394
我写这些故事并不是为了普利策文学奖
I didn't write those stories hoping for a Pulitzer Prize in literature.

1503
01:33:13,468 --> 01:33:15,493
我写它，是因为我发现这是一种方法
I wrote them because I found a way to help.

1504
01:33:15,570 --> 01:33:18,403
无论何时你气馁了，我会告诉你另一个故事
Whenever you were discouraged, I told you another story.

1505
01:33:18,473 --> 01:33:21,965
你会更加努力地参试，接着你会做得更好
You tried a little harder, and you did a little better.

1506
01:33:25,446 --> 01:33:28,677
我现在是否还要编一个故事，或者你已经足够成熟……
Shall I make up a story now, or are you man enough...

1507
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:30,945
……到自己处理现在的问题？
...to handle the situation yourself?

1508
01:33:33,021 --> 01:33:35,717
一个月以前，你还觉得我不够成熟
A month ago, you didn't think I was man enough.

1509
01:33:37,091 --> 01:33:39,389
你说我还未准备好离开家
You said I wasn't ready to leave home.

1510
01:33:39,694 --> 01:33:41,218
为什么你改变主意了？
Why have you changed?

1511
01:33:43,398 --> 01:33:45,263
你怎么知道我改变了？
How do you know that I've changed?

1512
01:33:45,333 --> 01:33:47,927
你不再是一个月前离家的那个男孩了
You're not the boy who left home a month ago.

1513
01:33:48,069 --> 01:33:50,594
我今天来这里，希望你还是
I came down here today hoping that you were.

1514
01:33:55,610 --> 01:33:57,009
你知道，唐尼……
You know, Donnie...

1515
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:02,316
……适应不依靠任何人……
...it's not easy to adjust...

1516
01:34:03,151 --> 01:34:05,142
……是不容易的
...to not being needed anymore.

1517
01:34:05,987 --> 01:34:09,514
我现在能做到。你也要继续过你自己的生活
I can do it now, and you get on with your own life.

1518
01:34:13,561 --> 01:34:16,587
我会很乐意看到你有几件得体的家具的
I'd like to see you have some decent furniture.

1519
01:34:17,432 --> 01:34:19,798
一些餐具和杯子
Some dishes and some glasses.

1520
01:34:20,435 --> 01:34:21,834
我会送一些来
I'll send some up.

1521
01:34:22,670 --> 01:34:23,762
好的
Okay.

1522
01:34:25,974 --> 01:34:27,100
还有桌布
And linens.

1523
01:34:28,209 --> 01:34:29,574
大一点的烟灰缸
Bigger ashtrays.

1524
01:34:34,182 --> 01:34:35,308
你知道……
You know...

1525
01:34:35,950 --> 01:34:39,010
……如果你拾掇一下这个地方，也许就不会那么糟了
...if you fix this place up, it might not be so bad.

1526
01:34:41,489 --> 01:34:43,684
要我帮你稍微拾掇一下吗？
Could I help you fix it up a little?

1527
01:34:46,327 --> 01:34:47,419
当然
Sure.

1528
01:34:50,298 --> 01:34:53,267
我明天打电话过来，我们再讨论
I'll call you in the morning and We'll talk about it.

1529
01:34:55,236 --> 01:34:56,294
妈妈？
Mom?

1530
01:35:01,342 --> 01:35:02,832
我很高兴你能过来
I'm glad you came.

1531
01:35:15,189 --> 01:35:16,781
我爱你，唐
I love you, Don.

1532
01:35:19,027 --> 01:35:20,426
我知道，妈妈
I know, Mom.

1533
01:35:21,562 --> 01:35:22,824
我知道你的确爱我
I know you do.

1534
01:36:07,108 --> 01:36:08,473
你怎么样了？
How are you doing?

1535
01:36:08,910 --> 01:36:10,537
我就好
I'll be right in.

1536
01:36:20,988 --> 01:36:23,684
好了，我猜我带上了所有东西
Well, I guess I got everything.

1537
01:36:24,158 --> 01:36:27,616
我把擦碗布和灯泡留在厨房了，你或许需要
I left my dishtowels and light bulbs in the kitchen if you want them.

1538
01:36:27,695 --> 01:36:29,560
谢谢。我不需要
Thanks. I don't need them.

1539
01:36:32,233 --> 01:36:34,758
我们就不用道别什么的了
Let's not have any big good-byes or anything.

1540
01:36:35,336 --> 01:36:38,305
我会联系你的
你能呆一会儿吗？
-I'll be in touch with you.
-Can't you stay a minute?

1541
01:36:38,806 --> 01:36:41,673
一旦我想去什么地方，我喜欢马上就走，你知道吗？
Once I'm going somewhere I like to get going, you know?

1542
01:36:41,742 --> 01:36:42,834
我也是
I'm the same way.

1543
01:36:42,910 --> 01:36:45,310
我打算来一杯黑麦威士忌和咸牛肉三明治
I was going to have a corned beef sandwich on rye.

1544
01:36:45,379 --> 01:36:46,539
你想来点吗？
Do you want one?

1545
01:36:46,614 --> 01:36:48,673
一旦我走了，我喜欢马上就走……
Once I'm going, I like to get going...

1546
01:36:48,749 --> 01:36:52,014
……除非有人给我提供一份黑麦威士忌和咸牛肉三明治
...unless somebody offers me a corned beef sandwich on rye.

1547
01:36:56,290 --> 01:37:00,624
我从里面锁上了门，你能为我把钥匙给看门人吗？
I locked the door from the inside. Will you give the key to the janitor for me?

1548
01:37:00,728 --> 01:37:01,592
当然
Sure.

1549
01:37:02,163 --> 01:37:04,427
我把它放在桌子上
I'm putting it here on the table.

1550
01:37:04,732 --> 01:37:07,132
你最好让他把这扇门重新锁上
You'd better have him lock up that door again.

1551
01:37:07,201 --> 01:37:10,170
我会等等看是什么人搬进来。也许是一些有趣的人
I'll wait and see who moves in. It might be someone groovy.

1552
01:37:10,238 --> 01:37:12,035
我希望是
Yeah, I hope so.

1553
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:14,164
你要来杯啤酒吗？
You want a beer?

1554
01:37:14,408 --> 01:37:15,500
好的
Yeah.

1555
01:37:16,844 --> 01:37:19,870
蜡烛还点着
我非常虔诚
-The candles are still lit.
-I'm very religious.

1556
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:23,778
妈妈在哪里？
Where's Mama?

1557
01:37:23,885 --> 01:37:25,147
她回家了
She went home.

1558
01:37:25,653 --> 01:37:27,177
最终意见是什么？
What was the verdict?

1559
01:37:27,321 --> 01:37:29,846
她接受了我的独立宣言
She accepted my declaration of independence.

1560
01:37:29,991 --> 01:37:31,583
你在开玩笑？
没有
-You're kidding?
-No.

1561
01:37:31,926 --> 01:37:34,190
我必须说她进行了一场大战役
I must say she put up a great battle.

1562
01:37:35,663 --> 01:37:37,790
也许她赢了
Maybe she should have won.

1563
01:37:38,099 --> 01:37:41,262
也许你最好回家
现在改变了
-Maybe you'd be better off at home.
-Now that's a switch.

1564
01:37:42,770 --> 01:37:45,295
我已经考虑过这个
来吧，女孩
-I've been thinking about it.
-Come on, girl.

1565
01:37:45,373 --> 01:37:48,536
这花了我一整天的时间，还有三品脱的血来使我母亲信服
It took me a day, and three pints of blood to convince my mother.

1566
01:37:48,609 --> 01:37:52,545
我没有必要找你吵架
可我喜欢事情为我而做
-I don't have to start on you.
-Well, I like to have things done for me.

1567
01:37:52,613 --> 01:37:55,878
那就放弃拉尔夫和那出戏，和我妈妈一起搬进来
Then give up Ralph and the play and move in with my mother.

1568
01:37:56,317 --> 01:37:59,013
芥末吃完了
没关系
-I'm out of mustard.
-I don't care.

1569
01:38:01,189 --> 01:38:03,316
你觉得拉尔夫怎么样？
What did you think of Ralph?

1570
01:38:04,559 --> 01:38:05,821
你在哪里？
Where are you?

1571
01:38:06,527 --> 01:38:07,892
我坐在沙发上
I'm on the sofa.

1572
01:38:08,796 --> 01:38:11,094
我无法分辨你的声音从哪里传来
I couldn't tell where your voice was coming from.

1573
01:38:11,165 --> 01:38:13,998
你以前都能
我不够专心
-You always could before.
-I wasn't concentrating.

1574
01:38:14,235 --> 01:38:15,827
他看上去很友好
He seemed very nice.

1575
01:38:15,970 --> 01:38:17,232
谁？
拉尔夫
-Who?
-Ralph.

1576
01:38:17,772 --> 01:38:18,932
你不喜欢他
You didn't like him.

1577
01:38:19,006 --> 01:38:21,668
他看起来非常友好
我可以告诉你，他不像你
-He seemed very nice.
-I could tell you didn't like him.

1578
01:38:21,742 --> 01:38:22,606
你很紧张
You were uptight.

1579
01:38:22,677 --> 01:38:24,770
当周围超过一个人的时候我就会紧张
I'm uptight when there's more than one person.

1580
01:38:24,845 --> 01:38:26,472
我不得不弄明白谁在说话
I have to figure out who's speaking.

1581
01:38:26,547 --> 01:38:29,414
你不像他，因为他很粗俗
他很粗俗吗？
-You didn't like him because he was rude.
-Was he rude?

1582
01:38:29,483 --> 01:38:32,043
当然，比如对希尔斯波路，还有你的母亲
Well, putting down Hillsborough and your mother.

1583
01:38:32,119 --> 01:38:35,054
那是意外。我很抱歉你觉得他粗俗
That was an accident. I'm sorry you think he's rude.

1584
01:38:35,456 --> 01:38:38,323
我不觉得他粗俗
你刚说的，不是我
-I don't think he's rude.
-You said it, I didn't.

1585
01:38:38,559 --> 01:38:40,254
或者这里还有其他人
Or is there someone else here?

1586
01:38:40,328 --> 01:38:43,229
我知道他来这里带着一点点自高自大
I know he comes off as a little conceited.

1587
01:38:43,297 --> 01:38:45,822
告诉我，吉尔，你喜欢拉尔夫吗？
Tell me, Jill, do you like Ralph?

1588
01:38:48,169 --> 01:38:50,330
这是什么类型的问题？
What kind of a question is that?

1589
01:38:51,105 --> 01:38:54,632
我正搬去跟他一起住，为什么我会搬去跟我不喜欢的人一起住呢？
I'm moving in with him, why would I move in with a guy I don't like?

1590
01:38:55,076 --> 01:38:56,805
那就是我的下一个问题
That was my next question.

1591
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:00,843
我最好要离开
Well, I'd better be going.

1592
01:39:01,315 --> 01:39:04,375
拉尔夫正在等着……
我猜我不喜欢拉尔夫
-Ralph's waiting and--
-I guess I don't like Ralph.

1593
01:39:04,752 --> 01:39:08,654
我始终都知道，但是为什么？
就像你说的，他很粗俗和自负
-I knew it all along. But why?
-Like you said, he's rude and conceited.

1594
01:39:08,723 --> 01:39:12,454
我知道你是怎么想的，但他仅仅是看上去那样
I knew that's what you thought, but he only seems that way.

1595
01:39:13,728 --> 01:39:15,992
我希望我们能始终是朋友
I hoped that we could all be friends.

1596
01:39:16,397 --> 01:39:17,694
你真的希望吗？
Did you really?

1597
01:39:19,634 --> 01:39:21,966
好吧，谢谢你的三明治
Well, thanks for the sandwich.

1598
01:39:22,103 --> 01:39:23,593
我最好要离开了
I'd better be going.

1599
01:39:24,005 --> 01:39:27,031
我告诉你：你不喜欢拉尔夫・桑多
I'll tell you something: You don't like Ralph Santori.

1600
01:39:28,276 --> 01:39:29,140
天！
God!

1601
01:39:29,343 --> 01:39:32,870
我打包了两个袋子，这样我才能搬去跟他住一块
I packed two bags, so I can move in with him.

1602
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:35,981
我不在乎你是否拿了13个箱子，你不喜欢他
I don't care if you've got 13 trunks. You don't like him.

1603
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:38,416
你真是……
You really are something.

1604
01:39:38,586 --> 01:39:41,146
你想是因为你是瞎子，你什么都看不见
You think because you're blind, you couldn't see everything.

1605
01:39:41,222 --> 01:39:42,154
是的
Right.

1606
01:39:42,323 --> 01:39:44,985
第六感告诉我，你不喜欢拉尔夫・桑多
That sixth sense tells me you don't like Ralph Santori.

1607
01:39:45,059 --> 01:39:48,324
吓人吧，不是吗？
不，很傻
-Spooky, isn't it?
-No, it's just stupid.

1608
01:39:48,663 --> 01:39:51,393
我打包了两个包裹，就放在那儿
I packed two big bags, sitting right over there.

1609
01:39:51,465 --> 01:39:55,060
告诉我，吉尔，跟拉尔夫在一起是不是就像国庆节和圣诞节？
Tell me, Jill, with Ralph is it like the Fourth of July and Christmas?

1610
01:39:57,071 --> 01:39:58,470
准确地说不像
Not exactly.

1611
01:39:59,707 --> 01:40:02,039
他有某种优点
He has a kind of strength.

1612
01:40:03,477 --> 01:40:05,604
跟他在一起更像是劳动节
With him it's more like Labor Day.

1613
01:40:07,248 --> 01:40:09,739
你是不是也认为他是个好人？
Do you think he's a beautiful person, too?

1614
01:40:10,484 --> 01:40:12,679
在一些地方，是的
你爱他吗？
-In many ways, yes.
-Do you love him?

1615
01:40:12,820 --> 01:40:14,310
为什么我要回答？
Why should I answer that?

1616
01:40:14,388 --> 01:40:16,982
不管我怎么说，你已经下定了决心
No matter what I say you've made up your mind.

1617
01:40:17,058 --> 01:40:19,856
回答，你爱他吗？
是的。用我的方式
-Answer it. Do you love him?
-Yes, in my way.

1618
01:40:19,927 --> 01:40:21,827
昨天，你告诉我你不可能爱上别人
Yesterday, you told me you couldn't love.

1619
01:40:21,896 --> 01:40:24,626
那是昨天
我不是最有经验的人……
-That was yesterday.
-I'm not the worldliest person...

1620
01:40:24,699 --> 01:40:27,532
……但是当你冲向你爱的男人的怀抱的时候……
...but when you rush into the arms of the man you love...

1621
01:40:27,768 --> 01:40:29,861
……不会因为一个三明治而停下来！
...you don't stop for a sandwich!

1622
01:40:30,104 --> 01:40:32,129
是不是我母亲说了什么？
Was it something my mother said?

1623
01:40:32,873 --> 01:40:35,068
什么是你母亲说的？
Was what something your mother said?

1624
01:40:37,678 --> 01:40:40,806
你为什么离开？你没有来吃晚餐的原因
Why you're leaving? The reason you didn't show up for dinner.

1625
01:40:40,881 --> 01:40:42,610
我知道你没有忘记
I know you didn't forget.

1626
01:40:43,451 --> 01:40:45,442
是不是我母亲说了什么？
Is it something my mother said?

1627
01:40:46,454 --> 01:40:48,752
你都不听你母亲的话，我为什么要听？
You don't listen to your mother, why should I?

1628
01:40:48,823 --> 01:40:52,725
那么你为什么离开？不要拿该死的什么爱上拉尔夫的话来搪塞
Then why are you leaving? Don't give me that crap about loving Ralph.

1629
01:40:52,927 --> 01:40:55,395
我离开是因为我想离开
I'm leaving because I want to leave.

1630
01:40:55,763 --> 01:40:59,028
我是自由的，我想走的时候就走，好吧？
I am free and I go when I want to go, all right?

1631
01:41:01,202 --> 01:41:03,932
我想也许跟我有点关系
I thought it might have something to do with me.

1632
01:41:04,505 --> 01:41:06,973
这个跟你没有任何关系
It has nothing whatsoever to do with you.

1633
01:41:08,409 --> 01:41:09,501
好
Okay.

1634
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:15,313
与别人有亲密关系会让你吓得要死，不是么？
You're scared to death of becoming involved, aren't you?

1635
01:41:15,383 --> 01:41:17,146
我都告诉你了
I told you all about that.

1636
01:41:17,518 --> 01:41:20,976
是的，你告诉我了。没有责任，没有承诺
That's right, you told me, no responsibilities, no commitments.

1637
01:41:21,756 --> 01:41:25,192
这只是为了我能退出，在我……
It's just that I have to be able to get out, if I get tired--

1638
01:41:25,259 --> 01:41:26,419
对我感到厌倦的时候？
Of me?

1639
01:41:27,428 --> 01:41:29,828
对任何人感到厌倦的时候
如果我对你感到厌倦了会怎么样？
-Of anybody.
-What if I got tired of you?

1640
01:41:30,364 --> 01:41:33,333
对我？
没有任何人对你感到厌倦吗？
-Of me?
-Doesn't anyone ever get tired of you?

1641
01:41:33,401 --> 01:41:34,493
我不知道
I don't know.

1642
01:41:34,568 --> 01:41:37,093
我还没发现的时候就离开了
I don't hang around long enough to find out.

1643
01:41:37,338 --> 01:41:41,798
跟拉尔夫，你就能随时退出，但是跟一个瞎子就很难
With Ralph, you could walk out anytime but it might be a harder on a blind guy.

1644
01:41:41,876 --> 01:41:45,243
失明跟这个没关系
该死的你明白这有关系
-Blindness has nothing to do with it.
-You know goddamn well it has!

1645
01:41:45,312 --> 01:41:48,645
你跟拉尔夫，或者塞巴斯蒂安，或者欧文……一起出去都不会有这个问题
You wouldn't feel it walking out on Ralph or Sebastian or Irving...

1646
01:41:48,716 --> 01:41:52,243
……但是跟唐尼出去却有问题，你恨你自己，你不喜欢这样
...but walk out on Donnie, you'd hate yourself and you wouldn't like that.

1647
01:41:52,319 --> 01:41:55,186
要么恨我，要么爱我……
Well hate me or love me...

1648
01:41:55,556 --> 01:41:57,786
但是不要因为我是瞎子而离开我
...but don't leave because I'm blind.

1649
01:41:57,858 --> 01:41:59,951
也不要因为我是瞎子而留下来
And don't stay because I'm blind.

1650
01:42:04,965 --> 01:42:07,297
谁是塞巴斯蒂安和欧文？
Who are Sebastian and Irving?

1651
01:42:08,969 --> 01:42:10,300
谁都不是
Nobody.

1652
01:42:13,140 --> 01:42:15,438
有时候我只是不理解你
Sometimes I just don't understand you.

1653
01:42:16,677 --> 01:42:18,872
我的意思是，我们真的想法不一样
I mean, we really don't think alike.

1654
01:42:20,247 --> 01:42:22,738
我知道我只会伤害你，这是迟早的
I know I'd only hurt you, sooner or later.

1655
01:42:23,551 --> 01:42:25,280
我不想伤害你
I don't want to hurt you.

1656
01:42:26,187 --> 01:42:27,176
为什么不？
Why not?

1657
01:42:27,354 --> 01:42:30,289
你能对别人这样，为什么我却例外？
You can do it to others. Why am I an exception?

1658
01:42:33,694 --> 01:42:37,425
好吧，我只是不想成为另一个琳达・弗莱彻
Well, I just don't want to be another Linda Fletcher.

1659
01:42:37,998 --> 01:42:39,693
她伤害了你，不是吗？
She hurt you, didn't she?

1660
01:42:39,767 --> 01:42:41,598
是的，但是她也帮助了我
Yes, but she helped me, too.

1661
01:42:42,102 --> 01:42:44,127
当我需要她的时候，她就在身边
She was there when I needed her.

1662
01:42:44,472 --> 01:42:46,201
我不能承诺做到
I can't promise that.

1663
01:42:46,707 --> 01:42:49,904
我不知道当你需要我的时候，我会在哪里
I don't know where I'll be when you need me.

1664
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:55,415
姑娘，你需要我，远远超过我需要你
Girl, you need me a hell of a lot more than I need you.

1665
01:42:55,649 --> 01:42:59,107
我不需要任何人。我从没有也不会有
I don't need anybody. I never did and I never will.

1666
01:43:01,489 --> 01:43:02,854
我现在必须得走了
I have to go now.

1667
01:43:03,324 --> 01:43:05,815
我很高兴你说的是必须，而不是想要
I'm glad you said have to, and not want to.

1668
01:43:06,227 --> 01:43:08,252
我最后说的有些是对的
I finally said something right.

1669
01:43:13,033 --> 01:43:14,500
我会来看你
I'll be seeing you.

1670
01:43:18,672 --> 01:43:20,435
是的，来看你
Yeah, be seeing you.

1671
01:43:23,010 --> 01:43:25,103
我会一直想念你……
I'll think about you for years...

1672
01:43:25,312 --> 01:43:27,803
……并好奇如果你甚至有了亲密朋友……
...and wonder if you ever made a commitment...

1673
01:43:27,882 --> 01:43:29,713
……你是否会订下诺言
...if you ever got involved.

1674
01:43:31,285 --> 01:43:32,650
我希望不会
I hope not.

1675
01:43:35,556 --> 01:43:36,818
别担心……
Don't worry...

1676
01:43:37,892 --> 01:43:39,359
……这种事不会发生的
...it won't happen.

1677
01:43:40,294 --> 01:43:42,023
不能发生……
It can't...

1678
01:43:42,229 --> 01:43:45,027
……因为你缺乏情商，你知道吗？
...because you're emotionally retarded, you know?

1679
01:43:45,132 --> 01:43:46,963
那就是为什么你不能面对婚姻
That's why you couldn't face marriage.

1680
01:43:47,034 --> 01:43:49,298
那就是为什么你无法面对任何永久性的关系
That's why you can't face anything permanent.

1681
01:43:49,370 --> 01:43:51,395
你怕你自己会爱上我……
You're afraid you'll fall in love with me...

1682
01:43:51,472 --> 01:43:53,599
……你太年轻，还不懂得责任是什么
...and you're too adolescent for that responsibility.

1683
01:43:53,674 --> 01:43:57,667
你会在你的余生永远这样下去，考虑着你的自由
You're going to stay that way the rest of your life, thinking you're free.

1684
01:43:58,078 --> 01:43:59,909
天，我同情你……
God, I feel sorry for you...

1685
01:44:01,382 --> 01:44:03,179
……因为你是个残疾人
...because you're crippled.

1686
01:44:03,551 --> 01:44:05,041
我宁可是个瞎子
I'd rather be blind.

1687
01:44:59,306 --> 01:45:00,398
出租车
Taxi!

1688
01:45:01,075 --> 01:45:02,406
嗨，吉尔！
Hey, Jill!

1689
01:45:08,749 --> 01:45:09,977
快点
Come on.

1690
01:47:10,738 --> 01:47:11,830
谁？
Who is it?

1691
01:47:12,506 --> 01:47:13,666
谁在那儿？
Who's there?

1692
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:20,845
好消息是
The news is good.

1693
01:47:21,648 --> 01:47:23,138
不是你妈妈来了
It's not your mother.

1694
01:47:25,652 --> 01:47:27,347
你在这儿干什么？
What are you doing here?

1695
01:47:29,656 --> 01:47:31,681
你在地板上干什么？
What are you doing on the floor?

1696
01:47:34,628 --> 01:47:36,528
我打算野餐
I was about to have a picnic.

1697
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:40,865
不带上我？
Without me?

1698
01:47:43,537 --> 01:47:45,437
我不知道我有选择
I didn't know I had a choice.

1699
01:47:48,976 --> 01:47:52,343
我告诉你发生了什么的时候，你会为我骄傲的
You're going to be proud of me when I tell you what happened.

1700
01:47:52,813 --> 01:47:53,677
什么？
What?

1701
01:47:54,248 --> 01:47:55,510
影子视觉
Shadow vision.

1702
01:47:57,417 --> 01:47:58,782
什么意思？
What do you mean?

1703
01:47:59,586 --> 01:48:00,985
我能做到
Well, I can do it.

1704
01:48:01,555 --> 01:48:03,523
我刚刚做到了。真不可思议
I just did it. It was incredible.

1705
01:48:03,590 --> 01:48:06,855
我进来，离障碍物只差一步的时候，我冷静地停下来了
I came within one foot of this obstacle and I stopped cold.

1706
01:48:07,494 --> 01:48:09,189
障碍物是什么，电线杆？
What was it, a lamppost?

1707
01:48:10,197 --> 01:48:11,095
不是
No.

1708
01:48:12,499 --> 01:48:13,830
是拉尔夫
It was Ralph.

1709
01:48:24,011 --> 01:48:25,842
我承认我撒谎了
I have a confession to make.

1710
01:48:28,949 --> 01:48:30,780
就撒了一点
I cheated just a little.

1711
01:48:32,386 --> 01:48:33,785
我的眼睛是睁着的
My eyes were open.

1712
01:48:40,394 --> 01:48:41,986
早该如此
Well, it's about time.

1713
01:48:48,601 --> 01:49:04,070
