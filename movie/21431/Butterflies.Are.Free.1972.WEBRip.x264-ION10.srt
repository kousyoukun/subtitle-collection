I'm fine, thank you.
How are you?

29
00:04:53,258 --> 00:04:57,469
It's warm here.
How's it in Hillsborough?

30
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:00,679
Well, it's warm here, too.

31
00:05:01,577 --> 00:05:02,785
Hello, Mother.

32
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:04,373
MRS. BAKER:
How did you know?

33
00:05:04,407 --> 00:05:06,202
DON:
When you call,
the phone doesn't ring.

34
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:07,824
It says, "'M' is for
the million things

35
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:10,724
"she gave you. 'O' is..."
I forgot what "O" is for.

36
00:05:10,758 --> 00:05:13,554
You seem to have forgotten
a lot of things lately.

37
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:14,935
How are you feeling?

38
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:16,799
I'm fine, thank you.
How are you?

39
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,836
MRS. BAKER: Very well. How's the weather?

40
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:22,149
It's warm here.
How's it in Hillsborough?

41
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:23,219
MRS. BAKER: Warm.

42
00:05:23,253 --> 00:05:24,703
Well, it's warm here, too.

43
00:05:24,738 --> 00:05:25,946
How's the apartment?

44
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,568
DON: Uh, great. I love it.

45
00:05:27,603 --> 00:05:29,087
What did you do
last night?

46
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,744
Last night?
I didn't do anything.

47
00:05:30,778 --> 00:05:31,883
I mean, I didn't go out.

48
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:33,850
Uh, I had some friends in.

49
00:05:33,885 --> 00:05:36,922
It was just
a little party.

50
00:05:36,957 --> 00:05:39,684
I don't know
how many people there were.

51
00:05:39,718 --> 00:05:40,926
Do you have to have a number?

52
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:42,031
MRS. BAKER: Is it a secret?

53
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:43,653
Twelve and a half.
How's that?

54
00:05:43,688 --> 00:05:46,311
Did they stay late?DON: No,
they didn't stay too late.

55
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,657
I'd like to come by
and see you.

56
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:49,072
No.

57
00:05:49,107 --> 00:05:51,834
Donny, I'm coming
into town tomorrow anyway.

58
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:53,318
I have to go to Saks.

59
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,285
I said no, and I mean it.

60
00:05:56,286 --> 00:05:59,220
I don't give a damn.
I said, no.

61
00:06:02,223 --> 00:06:04,294
Because we have
an agreement, that's why!

62
00:06:05,882 --> 00:06:07,815
We agreed to two months.

63
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,093
I've got one month left,
and I want every minute of it.

64
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:14,028
Donny, you are so irritating,
I could absolutely cry.

65
00:06:14,063 --> 00:06:15,029
DON: What?

66
00:06:15,064 --> 00:06:16,928
What is that noise?

67
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:18,412
It's coming from next door.

68
00:06:18,447 --> 00:06:20,552
MRS. BAKER:
Who lives next door?A girl.

69
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:21,829
What's her name?

70
00:06:21,864 --> 00:06:23,313
I don't know.
I haven't met her yet.

71
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:26,696
Look, I can hardly hear you.
Call me tomorrow.

72
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:42,954
DON: Hey, will you please
lower your television?

73
00:06:42,988 --> 00:06:44,783
I can't hear you!
Wait a minute!

74
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:48,028
Sorry.
I couldn't hear you.

75
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:49,926
DON: I said, "Please lower
your television."

76
00:06:49,961 --> 00:06:52,584
You don't
have to turn it off.
Just lower it down.

77
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:54,931
JILL: It's not a television.
It's a radio.

78
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:56,864
Whatever. These walls
are like paper.

79
00:06:56,899 --> 00:07:00,868
I know.
You can practically
see through them.

80
00:07:00,903 --> 00:07:02,732
No, not really.

81
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:06,702
Hey, how about
a cup of coffee?

82
00:07:06,736 --> 00:07:08,531
DON: No, thank you.
Just had some.

83
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:09,877
I meant for me.

84
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:13,812
Yeah. Sure. Come on in.

85
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:15,780
Okay.

86
00:07:30,277 --> 00:07:31,692
DON: It's open.

87
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,248
Hi. I'm Jill Tanner.

88
00:07:36,283 --> 00:07:37,353
Don Baker.

89
00:07:37,387 --> 00:07:39,631
Would you mind... Oops...
Zipping up my blouse.

90
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,184
Can't reach back there.

91
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:43,117
Hope you don't mind me
inviting myself in.

92
00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:45,223
Not at all.
Water'll be hot
in a minute.

93
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:48,122
Your living room's
much bigger than mine.

94
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:51,643
Oh, nice.

95
00:07:51,678 --> 00:07:53,162
How long
have you
been here?

96
00:07:53,196 --> 00:07:54,094
A month.

97
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:55,233
Except that's not
the living room.

98
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,891
That's the whole
apartment,
plus a bathroom.

99
00:07:57,925 --> 00:08:00,652
I've got three rooms,
if you count the kitchen.

100
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:02,654
God, you're neat.

101
00:08:03,655 --> 00:08:07,141
Hmm.
Everything's so tidy.

102
00:08:07,176 --> 00:08:08,798
It's easy
when you haven't
got anything.

103
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,835
I don't have anything,

104
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:13,527
but it manages
to wind up
all over the place.

105
00:08:13,562 --> 00:08:14,735
Hmm.

106
00:08:15,425 --> 00:08:18,221
I'm afraid I'm a slob.

107
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:24,158
Oh, hey,
I like your skylight!

108
00:08:24,193 --> 00:08:27,645
I don't have one.
What's this?

109
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:29,681
What?This thing on stilts.

110
00:08:29,716 --> 00:08:31,062
That's my bed.

111
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:32,891
Your bed!

112
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:34,997
Wow!

113
00:08:36,101 --> 00:08:38,966
This is wild!You like it?

114
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:41,797
Oh, it's the greatest bed
I've ever seen,

115
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:44,524
and I've seen
a lot of beds.

116
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:45,939
Did you build it?

117
00:08:45,973 --> 00:08:48,320
No. Some hippies
lived here before me.
They built it.

118
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:49,736
Suppose you fall out?

119
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,670
Ooh, gee, you could
break something.

120
00:08:52,704 --> 00:08:54,672
You could break something
falling out of any bed.

121
00:08:55,189 --> 00:08:56,225
That's true.

122
00:08:57,053 --> 00:08:58,538
I could've had
your apartment,

123
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:00,919
but I took this one
on account of the bed.
Cream or sugar?

124
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:01,817
Hmm.

125
00:09:01,851 --> 00:09:04,336
Oh, just black,
thanks.

126
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:09,272
Here you go.Oh, thanks.

127
00:09:09,307 --> 00:09:11,378
This coffee'll
save my life.

128
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:14,346
I bought flowers
and dumb things

129
00:09:14,381 --> 00:09:17,453
like dish towels
and paper napkins,
but I forgot coffee.

130
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:22,389
Do you need any dish towels
or paper napkins?No.

131
00:09:22,423 --> 00:09:24,080
I've lots of
light bulbs, too.

132
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:27,118
May I ask you
a personal question?

133
00:09:27,152 --> 00:09:28,153
Yeah. Sure.

134
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:29,741
Why don't you want
your mother to come here?

135
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:31,191
Well, now,
how'd you know that?

136
00:09:31,225 --> 00:09:33,538
Well, if you can
hear me,
I can hear you.

137
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,886
I guess the sound
must come right out
from under that door.

138
00:09:36,921 --> 00:09:39,337
What's that door for,
anyway?

139
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:41,960
Your apartment and mine
were once one apartment.

140
00:09:41,995 --> 00:09:43,203
And when
they converted it
into two,

141
00:09:43,237 --> 00:09:46,344
they just locked that
instead of sealing it.

142
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,932
You didn't answer
my question.

143
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:49,623
I forgot
what you asked.

144
00:09:49,658 --> 00:09:51,867
Why don't you
want your mother here?

145
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:53,696
It's a long story.

146
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:54,904
No,
it's a short story.

147
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:56,803
It's just been going on
for a long time.

148
00:09:56,837 --> 00:09:58,149
She didn't want me
to leave home,

149
00:09:58,183 --> 00:10:00,530
because she thinks
I can't make it
on my own.

150
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:01,877
Anyway,
finally we agreed

151
00:10:01,911 --> 00:10:03,223
to letting me try it
for two months.

152
00:10:03,257 --> 00:10:05,328
She's to keep away
from me for two months.

153
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:07,399
I've got
a month to go.

154
00:10:07,434 --> 00:10:09,505
Why'd you tell her
you had a party
last night?

155
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:11,645
You don't miss anything
in there, do you?

156
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,302
Very little.

157
00:10:13,336 --> 00:10:16,270
I always tell her
I had a party
or I that went to one.

158
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:17,996
She just wouldn't
understand why
I'd rather be alone

159
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:20,896
than keeping her
and the cook company.

160
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,691
She's gonna
hate this place.

161
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:25,245
She hates it now
without even seeing it.

162
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,697
She'll walk in and say,
"I could absolutely cry."

163
00:10:28,731 --> 00:10:31,113
Does she cry a lot?No.
Just threatens to.

164
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:32,493
Well, if she really
wants to cry,

165
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:34,392
send her in
to look at my place.

166
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,290
At least you're neat.

167
00:10:36,325 --> 00:10:38,430
You know,
you're old enough
to live alone.

168
00:10:38,465 --> 00:10:41,157
I'm 19. How old are you?

169
00:10:41,192 --> 00:10:44,091
As far as
my mother's concerned,
I'm 11 going on 10.

170
00:10:44,126 --> 00:10:47,060
We must have the same mother.

171
00:10:47,094 --> 00:10:50,304
My mother would love for me
to stay a child all my life.

172
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,030
So she won't age.

173
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:55,240
She loves it
when people say to her
we look like sisters.

174
00:10:55,275 --> 00:10:57,587
And if they don't say it,
she tells them.

175
00:10:57,622 --> 00:10:59,175
Have you got
a job?

176
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,384
No, but I play guitar,
and I got a few prospects.

177
00:11:01,937 --> 00:11:03,076
I know.

178
00:11:04,284 --> 00:11:05,734
I heard you
last night.

179
00:11:05,768 --> 00:11:07,218
Oh, I'm sorry.

180
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:09,807
Oh, no, it was good.
Really, I thought
it was a record

181
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:12,085
till I kept hearing it
over and over again.

182
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:14,225
Well, I can't read music,
so I gotta learn by ear.

183
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:15,744
I'm trying
to put together
an act.

184
00:11:16,123 --> 00:11:17,469
Then what?

185
00:11:17,504 --> 00:11:18,988
Well, then I'll try
to cash in on a few
of those prospects.

186
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:21,853
I know one thing.
I ain't a-goin' back
to Hillsborough.

187
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:24,131
What's Hillsborough?You don't know
Hillsborough?

188
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,893
No, I don't know much
about any place up here.

189
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:28,515
I'm from Los Angeles.

190
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:30,103
I've never been north
of Big Sur.

191
00:11:30,137 --> 00:11:32,588
Hillsborough is about
ten miles from here.

192
00:11:32,622 --> 00:11:33,727
Is that
where you live?

193
00:11:33,762 --> 00:11:36,488
No. I live here.
It's where
I used to live.

194
00:11:36,523 --> 00:11:38,594
Oh, right.

195
00:11:38,628 --> 00:11:40,044
What'd you say
your name was?

196
00:11:41,252 --> 00:11:42,702
Jill Tanner.

197
00:11:43,772 --> 00:11:47,051
Technically, I guess,
I'm Mrs. Benson.

198
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:49,363
I was married once
when I was 16.

199
00:11:49,398 --> 00:11:50,779
Sixteen?

200
00:11:50,813 --> 00:11:52,090
How long
were you married?

201
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,370
Seemed like weeks.

202
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,755
Actually,
it was six days.

203
00:12:02,273 --> 00:12:03,930
What was he like?

204
00:12:08,555 --> 00:12:11,869
I'm sorry. I really
don't wanna
talk about him.

205
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,388
Well, then don't.
I'm sorry I asked.

206
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:16,943
No, I will talk about him.

207
00:12:16,977 --> 00:12:19,462
Once in a while,
you should do something
you don't wanna do.

208
00:12:19,497 --> 00:12:21,671
Cleanses the insides.

209
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:30,197
Jack was wild-looking,
sort of adolescent.

210
00:12:30,232 --> 00:12:32,924
Girls mature faster
than boys, don't they?

211
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:38,861
Anyway, we met,
and it was like
fireworks, rockets.

212
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:42,313
Every day was like
the Fourth of July.

213
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:44,211
And the next thing I knew,
we were standing in front

214
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:46,696
of the Justice
of the Peace
getting married.

215
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:48,043
How long
had you known him?

216
00:12:48,077 --> 00:12:51,046
Oh, I don't know.
Two, three weeks.

217
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,255
But, I mean,
there we were
getting married,

218
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:55,878
and I wasn't even out
of high school yet.

219
00:12:55,913 --> 00:12:57,604
And I had two exams
the next day,

220
00:12:57,638 --> 00:13:00,745
and they were
on my mind, too.

221
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,368
And then I heard
the Justice of the
Peace saying,

222
00:13:03,403 --> 00:13:08,373
"Do you, Jack, take Jill to be
your lawfully wedded wife?"

223
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:13,102
Can you imagine going through
life as "Jack and Jill"?

224
00:13:13,137 --> 00:13:17,072
And then I heard him say,
"Till death do us part."

225
00:13:19,246 --> 00:13:22,353
Suddenly it became
more like a funeral service
than a wedding ceremony.

226
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:23,630
Oh, Jesus.

227
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:26,875
Oh, it was so morbid.
I hate anything morbid.

228
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:28,083
Yeah, but as long
as you were married,

229
00:13:28,117 --> 00:13:29,532
why didn't you
try to make it work?

230
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:32,673
I did. I did.
I tried.

231
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:36,712
For six days
I tried, but I knew
it was a mistake.

232
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:38,369
Were you
in love with him?

233
00:13:38,403 --> 00:13:40,612
In my way.What's your way?

234
00:13:40,647 --> 00:13:41,993
I don't know.

235
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:44,030
Well, just 'cause
you love someone

236
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:45,548
doesn't necessarily mean
you wanna spend

237
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,688
the rest of your life
with them.

238
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:51,313
And Jack loved me.

239
00:13:51,347 --> 00:13:55,938
I mean, he really, really
loved me, and I hurt him.

240
00:13:55,973 --> 00:13:58,527
And that's just
what I can't stand.

241
00:13:58,561 --> 00:14:00,943
I just never
wanna hurt anybody.

242
00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:04,257
Marriage is a commitment,
isn't it?

243
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:07,260
And I just
can't be committed
or involved.

244
00:14:07,294 --> 00:14:11,954
Can you understand?Yeah, I can understand,
but I don't agree.

245
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:14,129
Well, then you really
don't understand.

246
00:14:15,993 --> 00:14:17,718
Wow.

247
00:14:17,753 --> 00:14:20,618
I thought
I was sloppy.

248
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,275
What do you mean?

249
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:24,035
Unless you know
something
I don't know,

250
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,657
like ashes
are good
for the table.

251
00:14:25,692 --> 00:14:28,453
Is that why
you keep dropping
them on there?

252
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:30,007
Did you move
the ashtray?

253
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,906
It's right here.
What are you? Blind?

254
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:34,666
Yes.

255
00:14:36,945 --> 00:14:38,601
What do you mean, "yes"?

256
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:40,880
I mean, yes,
I'm blind.

257
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,715
Oh, you're putting
me on.

258
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:50,096
Don't do that.

259
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,822
No. I'm blind.
I've always
been blind.

260
00:14:57,724 --> 00:15:01,624
You mean, really blind,
not just nearsighted?

261
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:04,144
The works.
I can't see a thing.

262
00:15:26,684 --> 00:15:28,789
Oh, God.

263
00:15:28,824 --> 00:15:31,068
Oh, I hope
I didn't say anything.

264
00:15:31,102 --> 00:15:33,725
Now, wait a minute
Don't get self-conscious
about it. I'm not.

265
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,004
Why didn't
you tell me?I just did.

266
00:15:36,038 --> 00:15:37,384
But I...
When I came in?

267
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:38,627
You didn't ask me.

268
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:39,973
Well, why
would I ask you?

269
00:15:40,008 --> 00:15:41,664
I don't walk
into somebody's
house and say,

270
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:44,081
"Hi, I'm Jill Tanner.
Are you blind?"

271
00:15:44,115 --> 00:15:45,530
And I don't
meet someone and say,

272
00:15:45,565 --> 00:15:47,084
"Don Baker,
blind as a bat."

273
00:15:47,118 --> 00:15:49,155
Well, I still think
you should've told me.

274
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:50,777
I would've told you.

275
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:52,986
I wanted to see
how long it would
take you to catch on.

276
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:54,954
Oh, God.

277
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:58,095
Oh, and I saw you
standing at the window
all that time.

278
00:15:58,129 --> 00:15:59,855
Well, it's the coolest
spot in the room.

279
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:00,925
Oh.

280
00:16:01,788 --> 00:16:04,066
I thought
you were a Peeping Tom.

281
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,069
Well, now, that's
what I call
positive thinking.

282
00:16:07,104 --> 00:16:09,106
You know,
I nearly
called the police.

283
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,624
Suppose I had?

284
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:12,212
Well, they'd have
locked you up.

285
00:16:16,527 --> 00:16:20,186
Y... You're so cool,
so adjusted.

286
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,396
No, I'm not.
I never had to adjust.
I was born blind.

287
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,881
It'd be different
if I'd been able to see,
then went blind,

288
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:28,194
but for me,
blindness is normal.

289
00:16:28,228 --> 00:16:29,781
I was six years old
before I found out

290
00:16:29,816 --> 00:16:31,024
everybody else
wasn't blind.

291
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:33,302
And by then,
it didn't make
any difference.

292
00:16:33,337 --> 00:16:34,786
So let's relax, okay?

293
00:16:34,821 --> 00:16:36,167
You know,
if we can have
a few laughs,

294
00:16:36,202 --> 00:16:37,237
so much the better.

295
00:16:38,204 --> 00:16:39,688
A few laughs?

296
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:41,931
About blindness?

297
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:45,797
No, not about
blindness.

298
00:16:45,832 --> 00:16:48,559
Can't you forget that?

299
00:16:48,593 --> 00:16:51,320
Well, you're the first
blind person I ever met.

300
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:52,356
Congratulations.

301
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,013
It's too bad
they don't give out
prizes for that.

302
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:56,015
Well, I mean,
I've seen blind men
in the street

303
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,431
and everything,
with dogs, but...

304
00:16:58,465 --> 00:16:59,846
Why don't you
have a dog?

305
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,607
They attract too
much attention.
I'd rather do it myself.

306
00:17:02,642 --> 00:17:05,886
Well, don't you have
trouble getting around
San Francisco?

307
00:17:05,921 --> 00:17:07,888
I mean,
it's tough for me.

308
00:17:07,923 --> 00:17:09,787
No. I manage
very well
with my cane.

309
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,548
And I know exactly
how many steps
to the laundry,

310
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,826
to the drugstore
and to the delicatessen.

311
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:17,381
Where's the laundry?
I need one.

312
00:17:17,415 --> 00:17:18,899
Near the
delicatessen.

313
00:17:18,934 --> 00:17:20,142
Go out of the house,
turn right,

314
00:17:20,177 --> 00:17:21,833
and it's 44 steps
from the front door.

315
00:17:21,868 --> 00:17:24,112
I didn't see it.I'll show you.

316
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:26,873
You'll sh...

317
00:17:28,219 --> 00:17:29,358
Wow.

318
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:32,327
Hey, what about
your apartment?

319
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:34,915
I mean, don't you
bang into things?
You could hurt yourself.

320
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,228
I memorized
the room.
Here.

321
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:38,367
Bed.

322
00:17:38,402 --> 00:17:39,472
Guitar.

323
00:17:41,715 --> 00:17:43,131
Bathroom.

324
00:17:46,134 --> 00:17:47,825
Jacket. My cane.

325
00:17:49,275 --> 00:17:50,345
Front door.

326
00:17:51,346 --> 00:17:52,657
Bookcase.

327
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,556
Wine. Glasses.

328
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,972
Chest of drawers.
Linen.

329
00:17:57,006 --> 00:17:59,078
What are these books?Braille.

330
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:03,012
Dining table.

331
00:18:03,047 --> 00:18:04,083
Bathtub.

332
00:18:07,258 --> 00:18:08,363
Kitchen.

333
00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:15,370
Ketchup, oil, salt,
pepper, sugar, coffee.

334
00:18:15,404 --> 00:18:18,097
Gee.Now, if you'll just
put the ashtray back.

335
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,098
Oh.

336
00:18:25,173 --> 00:18:26,553
Voila.

337
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:27,692
As long as you don't
move anything,

338
00:18:27,727 --> 00:18:29,004
I'm as good as
anybody else.

339
00:18:29,487 --> 00:18:31,006
Better.

340
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:34,285
I can't find anything
in my place.

341
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,770
If you really
wanna see chaos,
come look at...

342
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:39,497
Oh, I'm sorry.

343
00:18:39,532 --> 00:18:41,741
I'm so... I meant...
I mean that...

344
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:43,639
Oh, I know
what you mean.

345
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:45,193
Look, I'm no different
from anybody else,

346
00:18:45,227 --> 00:18:46,608
except I don't see.

347
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:47,816
The blindness
doesn't bother me

348
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,714
as much as
other people's
reaction to it.

349
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:52,061
If they'd only
behave naturally.

350
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:53,615
Some people
want to assume guilt,

351
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:56,721
which they can't,
because my mother
has that market cornered.

352
00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:58,861
So just be yourself.

353
00:18:58,896 --> 00:19:02,969
Well, I always thought
that blind people were,

354
00:19:03,003 --> 00:19:05,661
well, you know,
kind of spooky.

355
00:19:07,215 --> 00:19:08,526
But of course.

356
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:12,220
We sleep all day,
hanging upside down
from the shower rod.

357
00:19:12,254 --> 00:19:15,084
When it's dark,
we wake up and fly in
through people's windows.

358
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,397
That's why they say,
"Blind as a bat."

359
00:19:17,432 --> 00:19:18,605
Come on.
I'm serious.

360
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,780
Now, be serious.

361
00:19:20,814 --> 00:19:23,576
Don't blind people
have a sixth sense?

362
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,887
No. If I had
six senses,

363
00:19:24,922 --> 00:19:26,441
I'd still
only have five,
wouldn't I?

364
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:28,822
I mean, my other senses,
hearing, taste and touch,

365
00:19:28,857 --> 00:19:30,928
might be a little
more developed
than yours.

366
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,930
That's just 'cause
I use 'em more.

367
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:34,173
I'll show you
something.

368
00:19:35,726 --> 00:19:37,072
Spin me around.

369
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,321
No, I mean
really spin me.Okay.

370
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,366
There's something
in front of me.

371
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:56,678
The window.

372
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,302
That's wild.
How'd you do that?

373
00:20:00,337 --> 00:20:01,579
It's called
shadow vision.

374
00:20:01,614 --> 00:20:03,409
What's shadow vision?

375
00:20:03,443 --> 00:20:04,824
Uh, it's being
able to sense

376
00:20:04,858 --> 00:20:06,722
that there's
a solid object
in front of you.

377
00:20:06,757 --> 00:20:09,380
You can feel it.
It's kind of a warning.

378
00:20:09,415 --> 00:20:10,519
Sighted people
can do it too,

379
00:20:10,554 --> 00:20:12,245
but blind people
can do it better.

380
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,833
I wanna try it.

381
00:20:22,635 --> 00:20:23,981
Ouch! My...

382
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:25,154
Oh... Ouch.

383
00:20:25,189 --> 00:20:27,467
There are advantages
to being blind.

384
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:32,161
Oh, I think
it's so great
you're not bitter.

385
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:34,785
You don't seem to have
any bitterness at all.

386
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:37,822
I know I'd be
terribly bitter
if I couldn't see.

387
00:20:37,857 --> 00:20:40,653
I know I'd be
disagreeable.I doubt it.

388
00:20:40,687 --> 00:20:44,139
Oh, no,
I couldn't be
cheerful like you.

389
00:20:44,173 --> 00:20:46,521
I don't have
any of those
marvelous qualities

390
00:20:46,555 --> 00:20:48,730
like courage
and fortitude.

391
00:20:48,764 --> 00:20:51,595
Oh, neither do I.
I'm just naturally
adorable.

392
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:54,011
You're a lot more
than that.

393
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:56,703
You're a very
superior person.

394
00:20:56,738 --> 00:20:59,085
Oh, yeah.
I'm fantastic.

395
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,157
I would not go gently
into that good night.

396
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:06,955
I would rage against
the dying of the light.

397
00:21:06,989 --> 00:21:09,302
Dylan Thomas?Who?

398
00:21:09,337 --> 00:21:11,787
That's a line
from a poem
by Dylan Thomas.

399
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:13,651
It is?Mmm-hmm.

400
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:16,275
You mean,
I can quote
Dylan Thomas?

401
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:17,759
How 'bout that?

402
00:21:17,793 --> 00:21:19,864
I've never
even read him.

403
00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:21,797
I don't know where
I learned it.

404
00:21:21,832 --> 00:21:23,903
I can quote
Mark Twain.Mmm-hmm.

405
00:21:23,937 --> 00:21:25,905
My favorite
quotation's
by Mark Twain.

406
00:21:25,939 --> 00:21:28,287
Wanna hear it?Go.

407
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:33,844
"I only ask
to be free.

408
00:21:33,878 --> 00:21:36,329
"The butterflies are free.

409
00:21:36,364 --> 00:21:40,609
"Mankind will surely
not deny to Harold Skimpole

410
00:21:40,644 --> 00:21:43,060
"what it concedes
to the butterflies."

411
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,686
I identify strongly
with butterflies.

412
00:21:49,411 --> 00:21:50,895
You like it?Yeah. Very much.

413
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,139
Except,
it wasn't written
by Mark Twain.

414
00:21:53,173 --> 00:21:55,935
Why not?It was written
by Dickens.

415
00:21:55,969 --> 00:21:57,488
Are you sure?Yeah.

416
00:21:57,523 --> 00:22:00,319
Harold Skimpole is a character
in Bleak House, by Dickens.

417
00:22:00,526 --> 00:22:01,872
Oh.

418
00:22:01,906 --> 00:22:04,115
I never read Dickens.

419
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,084
Actually,
I've never read
Mark Twain either.

420
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:09,535
But I always thought
he wrote that.

421
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:11,330
Have you read...

422
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:12,607
Oh, God.

423
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:14,091
Oh, God.

424
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,196
I have read Dickens
and I've read
most of Mark Twain,

425
00:22:16,231 --> 00:22:17,922
and stop
falling apart
at every word.

426
00:22:17,957 --> 00:22:19,303
They're published
in Braille.

427
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,064
That's awful to ask
someone who's blind

428
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:24,377
if he's read
something.Not at all.

429
00:22:24,412 --> 00:22:26,966
As a matter of fact,
I read very well
with my fingertips.

430
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,140
Just ask me
if I've felt any
good books lately.

431
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:31,522
Does anybody ever
read to you?

432
00:22:31,557 --> 00:22:33,731
Yeah. Magazines
and newspapers.

433
00:22:34,525 --> 00:22:36,493
Could I read
to you sometime?

434
00:22:36,527 --> 00:22:38,564
If you feel like it.

435
00:22:38,598 --> 00:22:40,669
What kind of magazines
do you like?

436
00:22:40,704 --> 00:22:43,810
Oh, Time, Newsweek, the Berkeley Barb.

437
00:22:43,845 --> 00:22:45,709
I like to know
what's going on
in the world.

438
00:22:45,743 --> 00:22:47,366
Yeah, I should
read those, too.

439
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,714
I never know
what's going on. I guess
I don't really care.

440
00:22:50,748 --> 00:22:52,440
Now, don't say that.

441
00:22:52,474 --> 00:22:54,994
Even animals care.
Vegetables don't.

442
00:22:55,028 --> 00:22:57,306
You have to care
about something
or you're nothing.

443
00:22:58,135 --> 00:23:00,827
Food.Food?

444
00:23:00,862 --> 00:23:02,450
I care about it
deeply.

445
00:23:02,484 --> 00:23:04,037
I'm hungry.

446
00:23:04,072 --> 00:23:06,281
Well, what about freedom?
You care about
being free, don't you?

447
00:23:06,315 --> 00:23:09,560
Freedom?
It's the most important
thing in the world to me,

448
00:23:09,595 --> 00:23:10,699
after I've eaten.

449
00:23:11,976 --> 00:23:14,600
Help yourself.Okay, thanks.

450
00:23:14,634 --> 00:23:16,325
My appetite
embarrasses me.

451
00:23:17,844 --> 00:23:20,882
You have to know
a lot about things
to care about them.

452
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,884
I don't know much
about anything.

453
00:23:22,918 --> 00:23:25,196
Oh, you don't
like yourself
very much, do you?

454
00:23:25,231 --> 00:23:29,373
Why do you say that?'Cause you're always
putting yourself down.

455
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,720
Let's say I know
my limitations.

456
00:23:32,894 --> 00:23:34,585
I think you have
a lot more potential

457
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,311
than you give yourself
credit for.

458
00:23:36,345 --> 00:23:37,726
Just keep
telling me that.

459
00:23:37,761 --> 00:23:39,728
No, Just keep
telling yourself that.

I could never get those
last lines right,

472
00:24:19,423 --> 00:24:22,081

that thing
about butterflies.

I know a little bit
about music.

480
00:24:47,969 --> 00:24:49,902
I studied it
in school.

481
00:24:49,936 --> 00:24:51,524
Did you finish school?

482
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:53,664
I finished
high school.
Just.

483
00:24:55,045 --> 00:24:57,012
My mother wanted me
to go to college.

484
00:24:57,047 --> 00:25:00,740
I was gonna go
to UCLA, but I couldn't
find a place to park.

485
00:25:02,017 --> 00:25:04,054
Listen. You oughta
make a record
or an album.

486
00:25:04,088 --> 00:25:06,228
No, I'm waiting
to be discovered.

487
00:25:06,263 --> 00:25:11,061
Well, after you get
discovered and you're
playing somewhere,

488
00:25:11,095 --> 00:25:13,063
you gonna dress
like this?

489
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:15,997
I hadn't really
thought about it.

490
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:18,033
Is something wrong
with my clothes?

491
00:25:18,068 --> 00:25:20,346
Well, they look as though
your mother bought 'em.

492
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,244
That bad, huh?

493
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:25,351
Well, I guess
it depends on
where you're playing.

494
00:25:25,385 --> 00:25:29,355
I mean, they're fine
if you're gonna play
in a bank.

495
00:25:29,389 --> 00:25:31,944
You oughta wear something
a little more liberated.

496
00:25:31,978 --> 00:25:33,946
My mother
does buy my clothes.

497
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,431
Oh, I'd love
to pick out something
really wild for you.

498
00:25:36,465 --> 00:25:38,467
Yeah? Like when?

499
00:25:38,502 --> 00:25:39,814
I don't know,
whenever you like.

500
00:25:39,848 --> 00:25:41,574
How about now?Right now?

501
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:42,713
Yeah.

502
00:25:42,748 --> 00:25:45,751
Okay. I don't have
anything to do.
Come on.

503
00:25:51,964 --> 00:25:53,690
Aren't you gonna
take your cane?

504
00:25:53,724 --> 00:25:56,278
No, I'm gonna take your arm.
You can see, can't you?

505
00:25:56,313 --> 00:25:57,694
Oh, yeah.
Wait a minute.

506
00:25:57,728 --> 00:25:59,143
Wait right there.

507
00:25:59,178 --> 00:26:01,042
I gotta get my bag.

508
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,232
Oh.

509
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:22,891
Oops.
Be careful.

510
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:31,797
Thirty-one, 32,
33, 34

511
00:26:31,831 --> 00:26:34,454
thirty-five, 36,
37, 38, 39

512
00:26:34,489 --> 00:26:38,010
forty, 41, 42,
43, 44...

513
00:26:38,044 --> 00:26:41,703
Hey, you're right!
It's 44 steps
to the laundry.

514
00:26:41,738 --> 00:26:43,084
What made you
come here?

515
00:26:43,118 --> 00:26:45,293
I just thought
I'd like to try
something different.

516
00:26:45,327 --> 00:26:46,639
Do you think
you'll stay?

517
00:26:46,674 --> 00:26:48,158
I don't really
think about it.

518
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,815
I'll see how it goes.

519
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:52,507
I may be an actress.
I say, "I may."

520
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:53,750
I'll know tomorrow.

521
00:26:53,784 --> 00:26:55,579
I'm auditioning
for a part
in a new play

522
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:59,031
with a little theater
group called
the Cosmic Workshop.

523
00:26:59,065 --> 00:27:00,929
It's about this girl
who gets all hung up

524
00:27:00,964 --> 00:27:02,828
when she marries
a homosexual.

525
00:27:02,862 --> 00:27:04,864
Originally,
he was an alcoholic,

526
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:08,281
but homosexuals
are very in now
in movies, books, and plays.

527
00:27:08,316 --> 00:27:09,662
So they changed it.

528
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:13,493
Are...
Are you homosexual?

529
00:27:13,528 --> 00:27:15,047
No, just blind.

530
00:27:16,738 --> 00:27:19,707
Careful.
There's a step!Ah! Up or down?

531
00:27:22,606 --> 00:27:24,470
JILL: One of my
best friends is gay.

532
00:27:24,504 --> 00:27:27,024
Dennis.
He's a designer.

533
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:29,786
He's good too.
He made this
blouse for me.

534
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,615
I'm sure it's
very pretty.

535
00:27:33,962 --> 00:27:35,895
Actually,
he made it
for himself,

536
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:38,139
but I talked
him out of it.

537
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:41,142
Dennis,
so campy
and funny.

538
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:44,455
I don't like lesbians.

539
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,665
They're so heavy
and humorless.

540
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:49,668
The director's a friend
of mine, and he thinks
I can do the part.

541
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:51,359
I just have to
be approved
by the author.

542
00:27:51,393 --> 00:27:55,432
Who's the director?You wouldn't know him.
His name's Ralph Santori.

543
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:57,089
He's from LA.

544
00:27:57,123 --> 00:27:58,746
He's done a lot
of little
theater there,

545
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,093
but never had a hit,
so he came up here

546
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:03,198
because he got a job
with the Cosmic Workshop.

547
00:28:04,752 --> 00:28:06,512
We kind of made it
together for a while,

548
00:28:06,546 --> 00:28:08,687
but then
he wanted
to get married,

549
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:11,379
and I just couldn't
face that again.

550
00:28:11,413 --> 00:28:13,105
Were you in love
with him?

551
00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:16,902
Uh, I don't really think
I've ever been
in love with anybody.

552
00:28:16,936 --> 00:28:19,421
I don't wanna be.
It's too confining.

553
00:28:19,456 --> 00:28:21,907
Somebody
always gets hurt.

554
00:28:21,941 --> 00:28:26,670
Hey, let's go in here.
They've got wild things.

555
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,499
There's steps.Up or down?

556
00:28:28,534 --> 00:28:29,500
Up.

557
00:28:29,535 --> 00:28:31,019
I can't think
of everything.

558
00:28:41,098 --> 00:28:42,479
Hi.

559
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:44,964
You need any help?No, thanks.
We're just looking.

560
00:28:46,345 --> 00:28:48,485
Where are we?Shirts.

561
00:28:50,556 --> 00:28:51,730
Oops.

562
00:28:55,906 --> 00:28:57,356
How about this?

563
00:28:58,391 --> 00:29:00,393
No, that's not for you.
That's for Dennis.

564
00:29:00,428 --> 00:29:01,947
It feels nice.

565
00:29:01,981 --> 00:29:04,501
I'll buy it.I'll buy it
for you.

566
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:05,674
No, I don't
want you to.

567
00:29:05,709 --> 00:29:07,884
Please let me
buy it for you.No.

568
00:29:07,918 --> 00:29:09,299
I really wanna
buy it for you.

569
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,853
Okay. Okay.

570
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:15,546
Here,
hold this up.

571
00:29:16,893 --> 00:29:18,446
Yeah,
it's not bad.

572
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,862
Can we do better
than "not bad"?

573
00:29:20,897 --> 00:29:22,001
Okay, wait.

574
00:29:25,591 --> 00:29:26,730
Mmm.

575
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:30,734
Hey. Yeah.
Try that on.

576
00:29:33,116 --> 00:29:34,324
Your jacket.

577
00:29:35,635 --> 00:29:38,431
You can take
my shirt too.Okay.

578
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:41,124
Found
anything yet?

579
00:29:41,158 --> 00:29:43,436
Don, this is
Mr. Asparagus.

580
00:29:43,471 --> 00:29:45,576
Hi.No, my name
is Roy Stratton.

581
00:29:45,611 --> 00:29:47,406
The shop
is called Asparagus.

582
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,994
Oh.I named it that

583
00:29:49,028 --> 00:29:51,513
'cause I always think
of asparagus as being
a friendly vegetable.

584
00:29:51,548 --> 00:29:56,449
I mean, you might see
one potato or one onion
or one corn,

585
00:29:56,484 --> 00:29:58,520
but you never
see one asparagus.

586
00:29:58,555 --> 00:30:01,938
They come in bunches.
They're involved.

587
00:30:01,972 --> 00:30:03,422
You never
see one pea.

588
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,564
Well,
I don't like peas.

589
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:10,739
Hey. This will
look great with it.

590
00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:13,397
Here,
try it on.Yeah.

591
00:30:13,432 --> 00:30:15,468
Give me
your other arm.

592
00:30:15,503 --> 00:30:18,506
Okay.
Oh, oh!

593
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,302
Yeah. Now,
that's together.
I like that.

594
00:30:21,336 --> 00:30:24,305
Mmm-hmm.
Sweet.I love it!

595
00:30:24,339 --> 00:30:26,445
Does it look
like an album cover?Yeah.

596
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:27,756
Hey, but what
you need is a hat.

597
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:30,345
Hats are big now.What kind of a hat?

598
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,452
Say, baby,
we got everything
here. Over here.

599
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:42,392
How about
a Confederate cap?

600
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:43,738
We sell
a lot of these.

601
00:30:43,772 --> 00:30:45,636
Yeah, I've seen
a lot of 'em.

602
00:30:46,258 --> 00:30:48,260
Now, I like
this one.

603
00:30:48,294 --> 00:30:49,986
What do you think?

604
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,815
No, I don't
think so.

605
00:30:52,229 --> 00:30:53,472
Okay.

606
00:30:53,506 --> 00:30:55,336
Oh, just
a minute.

607
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:57,234
Hey, how about
this?

608
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:59,202
A Tirolean hat.

609
00:30:59,236 --> 00:31:00,582
A Tirolean hat?
Well...

610
00:31:00,617 --> 00:31:02,895
Yeah,
that looks good.

611
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:06,036
I like that.
Take a look
at yourself.

612
00:31:06,071 --> 00:31:07,796
Oh.

613
00:31:09,626 --> 00:31:12,284
What do you
think?No.

614
00:31:12,318 --> 00:31:14,286
It makes me look
like Heidi.

615
00:31:15,528 --> 00:31:16,875
Got just the thing
for you now.

616
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:20,395
It's one of a kind,
if I can find it.

617
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,707
Here it is.

618
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:23,778
How about that?

619
00:31:24,158 --> 00:31:25,366
What is it?

620
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,644
It's a cap
from the French
foreign legion.

621
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:28,714
I love it.

622
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,547
Perfect fit.

623
00:31:34,582 --> 00:31:36,377
Man, you were born
with that hat on.

624
00:31:36,411 --> 00:31:37,896
Hey, take a look
at yourself.

625
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,969
No,
in the mirror.

626
00:31:47,975 --> 00:31:49,666
Hey, is he...

627
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,564
Yes, he is,
and stop
whispering.

628
00:31:53,566 --> 00:31:56,811
Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't...Oh, why?
It's not your fault.

629
00:31:56,845 --> 00:31:58,606
Don't make
a big thing
out of it.

630
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,366
We don't.How much is the hat?

631
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:01,574
It's on the house,
a souvenir.

632
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:02,990
How much is it?
How much is it?

633
00:32:03,024 --> 00:32:05,095
And the shirt
and the vest
and Jill's blouse?

634
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,132
Hey, they've got
the Berkeley Barb.

635
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:08,927
We'll take one
of these, too.

636
00:32:10,376 --> 00:32:13,690
Do you have
any dirty books?No.

637
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:16,693
Uh, too bad.
That's the only thing
they don't publish in Braille.

638
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,145
I guess
it was the idea
of someone blind

639
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:21,594
asking for
dirty books.

640
00:32:22,457 --> 00:32:24,494
No more.

641
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:26,772
You mean, it would've been
all right if I were sighted?

642
00:32:26,806 --> 00:32:28,118
I don't know.

643
00:32:28,153 --> 00:32:30,949
Anyway, you sure
threw 'em into shock.

644
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:34,124
What about you?Me?

645
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,575
I've been in shock
since I met you.

646
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,991
Well, do you think
you could
come out of it

647
00:32:39,026 --> 00:32:41,131
long enough to have
dinner with me tonight?

648
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:43,685
For dinner,
I'd come out
of a coma.

649
00:32:47,586 --> 00:32:49,519
Are you sure
we got enough
for dinner?

650
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:52,280
That's salami,
cole slaw
and potato salad.

651
00:32:52,315 --> 00:32:53,523
All my favorites.

652
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:56,319
Can I do something?

653
00:32:56,353 --> 00:32:59,080
Uh, tablecloth
in the chest of drawers.
You can set the table.

654
00:32:59,115 --> 00:33:00,495
Oh, let's not eat
at the table.

655
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,635
I mean, salami
and potato salad
and stuff,

656
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,499
that's not table food.

657
00:33:04,534 --> 00:33:07,571
Let's eat on the floor
and have a picnic.

658
00:33:07,606 --> 00:33:10,091
I've got a better idea.
Let's go to the beach.

659
00:33:10,126 --> 00:33:12,335
The beach?Yeah, I know
a little stretch of sand

660
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:13,888
where hardly
anybody ever goes.

661
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:15,683
Where?

662
00:33:15,717 --> 00:33:17,926
Over there
by the dining table.

663
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:20,826
You can see it better
if you're blind.Oh, really?

664
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,311
Then how come
you didn't notice
the tide came in?

665
00:33:23,932 --> 00:33:25,279
I see a much
better place.

666
00:33:25,313 --> 00:33:26,970
Where?By the bed.

667
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,558
Perfect.

668
00:33:37,463 --> 00:33:40,363
Is blindness
hereditary?I never heard that.

669
00:33:40,397 --> 00:33:41,812
Can your father see?

670
00:33:41,847 --> 00:33:44,505
I doubt it.
He's been dead
for six years.

671
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:46,507
Up till then,
he didn't have
any trouble, though.

672
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:49,234
JILL:
Bet you miss him.Yeah, I do.

673
00:33:49,268 --> 00:33:51,788
He was really
the only friend I had
when I was growing up.

674
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:53,479
We were very close.

675
00:33:53,514 --> 00:33:55,550
It's been
rough on Mom
since he died,

676
00:33:55,585 --> 00:33:58,622
because she's had to be
both, you know,
mother and father,

677
00:33:58,657 --> 00:34:00,452
and sister
and brother,Yeah.

678
00:34:00,486 --> 00:34:01,591
...and doctor
and lawyer...Okay.

679
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:03,075
...and congressman...Yeah.

680
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,421
...congresswoman,
rabbi, priest, padre... Ow.

681
00:34:04,456 --> 00:34:05,664
Oh,
I'm sorry.

682
00:34:05,698 --> 00:34:07,183
Do knives
go on the left
or right?

683
00:34:07,217 --> 00:34:08,839
On the right.Okay.

684
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:12,602
Why were you
born blind?

685
00:34:12,636 --> 00:34:14,431
Did the doctor
say why?

686
00:34:14,466 --> 00:34:16,364
Well, they said
it was a virus
in the womb,

687
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,332
which means
they don't know.

688
00:34:18,366 --> 00:34:20,299
You know,
I've heard that
women with syphilis

689
00:34:20,334 --> 00:34:22,025
give birth
to blind babies.

690
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,028
Could your mother
have had syphilis?

691
00:34:27,962 --> 00:34:30,551
You meet her,
then tell me
what you think.

692
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:33,692
When will that be?Uh, in a month.

693
00:34:33,726 --> 00:34:35,245
Hmm.

694
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,316
I got a month to go
before she comes down here
to see what's going on.

695
00:34:37,351 --> 00:34:40,630
As the clock strikes
a month, she's gonna
walk in that door.

696
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:42,977
You may have heard of her.
She wrote some books.

697
00:34:43,011 --> 00:34:47,982
Her name's Florence Baker.Um, no.
It's not familiar.

698
00:34:48,016 --> 00:34:49,432
But you can't
go by me.

699
00:34:49,466 --> 00:34:52,055
I may even be
quoting her,
and I wouldn't know it.

700
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,505
She wrote a series
of children's books.

701
00:34:53,539 --> 00:34:55,955
Guess what
they were about.Children?

702
00:34:55,990 --> 00:35:00,374
They were all about
a blind kid named
Little Donny Dark.

703
00:35:00,408 --> 00:35:01,892
Little Donny Dark?

704
00:35:01,927 --> 00:35:02,893
That's me.

705
00:35:02,928 --> 00:35:04,861
Oh, you'll say anything
to get attention.

706
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:07,864
No, it's true. I swear.
I hate that name, Donny.

707
00:35:08,968 --> 00:35:10,556
Ta-da!

708
00:35:10,591 --> 00:35:13,076
Tell me when I hit
the beach.

709
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,527
Stop! Oh.

710
00:35:17,425 --> 00:35:19,427
This is the first time
I've ever eaten
on the floor.

711
00:35:19,462 --> 00:35:21,705
It's so practical.

712
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,398
You can sit
in so many
different positions.

713
00:35:24,432 --> 00:35:26,676
You can even
lie down if you like.

714
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,574
Tables are so
confining.

715
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:29,782
Like love?

716
00:35:30,783 --> 00:35:31,853
Yes.

717
00:35:31,888 --> 00:35:34,787
And I never knew
what to do
with my elbows.

718
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,790
Something's missing.

719
00:35:39,689 --> 00:35:42,140
I know.Where are you going?

720
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:43,210
You'll see.

721
00:35:43,244 --> 00:35:44,418
Oh...

722
00:35:59,467 --> 00:36:01,504
Flowers.

723
00:36:01,538 --> 00:36:04,162
I thought it would
add just a touch
of elegance.

724
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:07,579
Now,
tell me more about
Little Donny Dark.

725
00:36:07,613 --> 00:36:09,995
It might curb
my appetite.

726
00:36:10,029 --> 00:36:11,445
Donny's
12 years old.

727
00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:13,171
He was born blind
like me,

728
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:14,724
but that's no handicap
to Little Donny Dark.

729
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:17,658
No. He can drive cars.
He flies planes.

730
00:36:17,692 --> 00:36:19,349
Because, you see,
his other faculties

731
00:36:19,384 --> 00:36:22,421
are so highly developed
that he can hear a bank
being robbed a mile away.

732
00:36:22,456 --> 00:36:25,286
He can smell the Communists
cooking up a plot
to overthrow the government.

733
00:36:25,321 --> 00:36:27,564
He's a diligent fighter
of crime and injustice.

734
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,841
And at the end
of every book,

735
00:36:28,876 --> 00:36:31,258
as he's being given a medal
by the police or the FBI,

736
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:32,845
he always says,

737
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,401
"There are none so blind
as those who will not see."

738
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:40,128
I'm taking
some more
of your salami.

739
00:36:40,163 --> 00:36:42,786
Since when do
the police and the FBI
give out medals?

740
00:36:42,821 --> 00:36:44,961
Since my mother
says they do.Oh.

741
00:36:45,962 --> 00:36:47,895
Mmm.
Let's have a drink.

742
00:36:47,929 --> 00:36:49,172
All I've got is wine.

743
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,242
That's all I drink.

744
00:36:50,277 --> 00:36:51,381
With salami?

745
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:52,762
With everything.

746
00:36:53,935 --> 00:36:55,661
Did children really
read those books?

747
00:36:55,696 --> 00:36:58,768
Shh. I'm counting so I don't
step in the picnic
on the way back.

748
00:37:05,947 --> 00:37:09,537
Mmm. You have just
finished your salami.

749
00:37:09,572 --> 00:37:11,539
Does your mother
still write 'em?

750
00:37:11,574 --> 00:37:13,955
No, she wrote six
of 'em when I was a kid.

751
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:16,234
They were no Mary Poppins,
but pretty popular,

752
00:37:16,268 --> 00:37:17,683
unless you happened
to be blind.

753
00:37:17,718 --> 00:37:19,547
Didn't exactly
tell it like it is.

754
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,273
Ah...

755
00:37:23,379 --> 00:37:24,621
I guess they were...

756
00:37:24,656 --> 00:37:26,899
They were a projection
of what she hoped I'd be.

757
00:37:26,934 --> 00:37:29,108
Sort of a sightless Superman.

758
00:37:29,143 --> 00:37:32,388
Did you have to go
to any special school
or anything?

759
00:37:32,422 --> 00:37:33,941
I went to
regular school.

760
00:37:33,975 --> 00:37:36,599
When I finished there,
nothing much happened
till about a year ago.

761
00:37:36,633 --> 00:37:39,567
What happened
a year ago?Hmm.

762
00:37:39,602 --> 00:37:41,673
A family
named Fletcher
moved near us,

763
00:37:41,707 --> 00:37:44,054
and their daughter
Linda used to come
and read to me.

764
00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:46,298
She was the first
close friend I had.

765
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:49,370
She was fantastic
and wild.

766
00:37:49,405 --> 00:37:54,202
She used to drive me here
all the time and take me
to all kinds of parties.

767
00:37:54,237 --> 00:37:59,207
Linda gave me something
that nobody else had thought
to give me, confidence.

768
00:37:59,242 --> 00:38:01,348
It changed
my whole life.

769
00:38:01,382 --> 00:38:04,454
I mean,
she talked me
into leaving home.

770
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:06,732
She found
this apartment
for me.

771
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:09,908
At first, I was scared
to death.

772
00:38:09,942 --> 00:38:11,496
But I did it.

773
00:38:12,669 --> 00:38:14,395
Maybe it was
a mistake.
I don't know.

774
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:17,536
No! No, it wasn't.

775
00:38:17,571 --> 00:38:20,090
You'd have to
do it sometime.

776
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:21,540
What's happened
to Linda?

777
00:38:21,575 --> 00:38:24,267
Well, she...
She flipped for a painter
we met at a party

778
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,442
and went to live
with him in Mexico.

779
00:38:27,374 --> 00:38:28,616
I wish she were here.

780
00:38:28,651 --> 00:38:30,618
It would make it
a lot easier.

781
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,931
Well, I'm here.

782
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:35,382
I'm right next door.

783
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:37,315
Anytime you need me,
just knock.

784
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:42,354
You don't even have to knock.
You just have to whisper,
and... And I'll hear you.

785
00:38:44,149 --> 00:38:45,323
Hey, you know what?

786
00:38:45,357 --> 00:38:48,015
Why don't we
open that door?Which door?

787
00:38:48,049 --> 00:38:50,120
That door
to my apartment.

788
00:38:50,155 --> 00:38:52,088
There must be a key.

789
00:38:52,951 --> 00:38:54,262
Let's unlock it.

790
00:38:54,297 --> 00:38:55,609
And then we can go
back and forth

791
00:38:55,643 --> 00:38:57,645
without having to run
down the hall.

792
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,267
The janitor
probably has a key,

793
00:38:59,302 --> 00:39:01,408
but I don't think
we oughta ask him.

794
00:39:01,442 --> 00:39:02,823
No, I don't think
we should do that.

795
00:39:02,857 --> 00:39:04,721
Why not?
We're friends,
aren't we?

796
00:39:04,756 --> 00:39:06,965
Yeah, but we'd be
practically
living together.

797
00:39:06,999 --> 00:39:08,346
How would it look?

798
00:39:09,968 --> 00:39:13,316
Who cares
how it looks?
I can't see anyway.

799
00:39:16,595 --> 00:39:19,184
I'll bet we could open it
with this sharp knife.

800
00:39:19,218 --> 00:39:20,772
We have to move
the chest.Okay.

801
00:39:20,806 --> 00:39:22,083
Move it towards you.

802
00:39:25,742 --> 00:39:27,434
There.
That's fine.
Okay.

803
00:39:28,296 --> 00:39:30,368
Oh. No hole.

804
00:39:31,886 --> 00:39:32,887
Oh.

805
00:39:33,992 --> 00:39:36,684
Damn it.

806
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:39,653
Oh,
I'm going to have
to call the janitor.

807
00:39:39,687 --> 00:39:40,757
Let me try.

808
00:39:55,323 --> 00:39:57,878
You did it!
It's open!

809
00:39:57,912 --> 00:40:00,777
Oh! Don't look!
It's an absolute
pigsty!

810
00:40:00,812 --> 00:40:01,951
Oh, I won't.

811
00:40:02,572 --> 00:40:05,713
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

812
00:40:05,748 --> 00:40:07,577
I'm sorry.

813
00:40:08,509 --> 00:40:10,891
I'll get
the hang of it.

814
00:40:10,925 --> 00:40:12,996
I just
don't know when.

815
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:17,276
Oh, let's
leave it open.

816
00:40:17,311 --> 00:40:19,900
Okay, but tell me
if you close it,
so I don't break my nose.

817
00:40:22,558 --> 00:40:25,837
Do you wish it were Linda
living there instead of me?

818
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:29,875
I hadn't
thought about it.
Why do you ask?

819
00:40:31,636 --> 00:40:34,880
I just wondered
if you were still
in love with her.

820
00:40:34,915 --> 00:40:37,435
Did I say
I was in love
with her?

821
00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:41,369
If I get too personal,

822
00:40:41,404 --> 00:40:43,924
just tell me
to shut up.

823
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:45,960
I get
carried away.

824
00:40:51,932 --> 00:40:54,175
Were you in
love with her?

825
00:40:55,591 --> 00:40:57,075
Are you?

826
00:40:58,973 --> 00:41:02,218
I think every man
should have some
mystery about him,

827
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:03,702
and that'll be mine.

828
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:05,911
What's she like?

829
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:08,742
Uh, she's very pretty.

830
00:41:09,363 --> 00:41:11,158
How do you know?

831
00:41:11,192 --> 00:41:13,401
I can feel
a person's face
and get a good idea

832
00:41:13,436 --> 00:41:14,782
what they look like.

833
00:41:14,817 --> 00:41:17,854
And I can tell
by shapes
and textures.

834
00:41:17,889 --> 00:41:21,409
Do you wanna know
what I look like?Yes.

835
00:41:21,444 --> 00:41:24,999
I'm gorgeous.Really?

836
00:41:25,034 --> 00:41:28,278
I wouldn't lie about
something like that.

837
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,697
I've always thought
if I could see
for just half a minute,

838
00:41:32,731 --> 00:41:34,353
that I'd like to see
how I looked.

839
00:41:34,388 --> 00:41:35,562
I'll tell you.

840
00:41:36,321 --> 00:41:37,598
Cute,

841
00:41:38,668 --> 00:41:40,221
and very sexy.

842
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,784
Your hair's
very soft.

843
00:41:52,406 --> 00:41:53,925
It's very long.

844
00:41:55,029 --> 00:41:58,964
Jesus!Oh. Oh,
don't be frightened.

845
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:01,657
What happened?Nothing. It's, um...

846
00:42:01,691 --> 00:42:03,659
It's called a fall.

847
00:42:03,693 --> 00:42:06,351
It's a long
piece of hair
you attach to your head.

848
00:42:06,385 --> 00:42:07,421
It's not your hair?

849
00:42:07,455 --> 00:42:08,871
It's not even my fall.

850
00:42:08,905 --> 00:42:11,149
I borrowed it
from Susan Potter.

851
00:42:11,183 --> 00:42:13,945
I do have my own hair. See?

852
00:42:13,979 --> 00:42:15,602
I mean, feel?

853
00:42:16,499 --> 00:42:17,673
Uh.

854
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:25,612
Oh, God! Now what?

855
00:42:25,646 --> 00:42:28,338
Uh, it's just an eyelash.

856
00:42:28,373 --> 00:42:30,064
You don't
have eyelashes?

857
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:31,756
Of course, but, um,

858
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:34,172
these just
make my eyes
look bigger.

859
00:42:34,206 --> 00:42:38,348
They're longer than mine.
Didn't Linda wear 'em?No.

860
00:42:38,383 --> 00:42:41,317
She probably
had naturally-long
lashes. I hate her.

861
00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:44,734
Well, go on.

862
00:42:45,735 --> 00:42:47,668
This is scaring
the hell out of me.

863
00:42:47,703 --> 00:42:50,706
Don't worry.
It's all real
from now on.

864
00:42:54,192 --> 00:42:56,608
Am I not the image
of Elizabeth Taylor?

865
00:42:56,643 --> 00:42:58,610
I've never felt
Elizabeth Taylor.

866
00:42:58,645 --> 00:43:00,578
We look exactly alike,

867
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:03,201
especially
if you can't see.

868
00:43:12,003 --> 00:43:13,107
That's my breast.

869
00:43:15,144 --> 00:43:16,145
All mine.

870
00:43:17,974 --> 00:43:19,700
Both of them.

871
00:43:31,712 --> 00:43:33,921
What's the matter?What do you
think's the matter?

872
00:43:33,956 --> 00:43:35,647
Well, I wouldn't ask
if I knew.

873
00:43:35,682 --> 00:43:38,270
Why are you doing this?

874
00:43:38,305 --> 00:43:41,998
I mean what is it, "Be Kind
to the Handicapped Week"
or something?

875
00:43:42,033 --> 00:43:43,482
You've been feeling
sorry for me

876
00:43:43,517 --> 00:43:46,520
ever since you came
in here this morning.

877
00:43:46,554 --> 00:43:48,453
"Take the poor
guy out shopping.
Show him a good time.

878
00:43:48,487 --> 00:43:50,524
"Get him into the sack,
and that'll take care
of my social work

879
00:43:50,558 --> 00:43:51,732
"for the next six months."

880
00:43:51,767 --> 00:43:55,425
Well, thanks a lot,
but don't patronize me.

881
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,220
And don't you feel
sorry for me.

882
00:43:59,188 --> 00:44:02,812
Well, let me tell
you something,
big mouth.

883
00:44:02,847 --> 00:44:06,436
I don't do anything
for anybody I don't want to,

884
00:44:06,471 --> 00:44:09,647
and I'll be goddamned
if I'm gonna feel
sorry for any guy

885
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:12,719
who's gonna
go to bed with me.

886
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,573
♪ I knew the day you met me

887
00:44:39,607 --> 00:44:42,749

JILL: I'm in here.

893
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:00,180
DON: What are you doing?

894
00:45:00,214 --> 00:45:02,044
I'm looking
for something.

895
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:04,115
Oh, here it is.

896
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:07,808
Good morning.

897
00:45:07,843 --> 00:45:11,916
What have you done
to your hair?I just combed it.

898
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:15,471
Well, I'll fix it.
What's wrong with it?

899
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:17,818
It doesn't go
with your new clothes.

900
00:45:17,853 --> 00:45:19,717
I have a present
for you.

901
00:45:21,201 --> 00:45:22,858
It's in here.

902
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:28,242
Beautiful wood.And mother-of-pearl.

903
00:45:29,865 --> 00:45:31,625
I take this
with me everywhere.

904
00:45:31,659 --> 00:45:34,766
Everything
that's important
to me is in here.

905
00:45:34,801 --> 00:45:38,736
This is a piece
of the moon or a star.

906
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:40,358
I found it
in the desert.

907
00:45:40,392 --> 00:45:41,773
And I showed it
to this geologist,

908
00:45:41,808 --> 00:45:44,224
and he said he'd never
seen any mineral
like it on Earth,

909
00:45:44,258 --> 00:45:46,640
and that it probably fell
from the moon or a star.

910
00:45:46,674 --> 00:45:48,676
Feels like a rock.

911
00:45:48,711 --> 00:45:50,299
Well, it isn't.

912
00:45:52,853 --> 00:45:56,132
And this is
one of my baby teeth.

913
00:45:57,824 --> 00:45:59,860
Thank you.

914
00:46:00,965 --> 00:46:03,691
And this is my
birth certificate.

915
00:46:03,726 --> 00:46:07,178
And this is a picture
of me when I was
in The Mikadoin high school.

916
00:46:07,212 --> 00:46:11,216
It's not
very good anyway.Oh, no. Let me see.

917
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,910
You were
chubbier then.Yeah.

918
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,775
Can you feel that?

919
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:21,261
Oh!
I believed you.

920
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,781
I always believe you.

921
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:27,854
And this is
my last will
and testament.

922
00:46:27,888 --> 00:46:29,752
Your last will
and testament?

923
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,030
And the instructions
to my funeral.

924
00:46:32,065 --> 00:46:34,688
My entire estate
is to be divided
equally among

925
00:46:34,722 --> 00:46:37,173
whoever are my four
closest friends
when I die.

926
00:46:38,623 --> 00:46:40,211
Names will be
filled in later.

927
00:46:40,245 --> 00:46:42,385
I thought you didn't
like anything morbid.

928
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:46,044
But it isn't morbid.
That's the point.

929
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,564
Funerals
don't have
to be morbid.

930
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:50,808
I know just how
I want mine.

931
00:46:51,739 --> 00:46:53,327
In a big church.

932
00:46:54,535 --> 00:46:56,883
And I want
all the pews removed.

933
00:46:56,917 --> 00:46:58,574
And nothing but
big, big cushions

934
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:00,472
for people
to lie around on.

935
00:47:00,507 --> 00:47:02,889
And I don't want
anybody dressed in black.

936
00:47:02,923 --> 00:47:07,376
I just want 'em
in gay, bright colors
and far-out clothes.

937
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:08,618
And they should
all be drinking

938
00:47:08,653 --> 00:47:11,000
or smoking pot,
or whatever they want.

939
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,246
And I want Salvador Dali
to paint the walls

940
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,110
with lots of groovy pictures.

941
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:20,216
And I want flowers.

942
00:47:20,251 --> 00:47:23,875
Tons of flowers.

943
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:27,120
Not funeral wreaths,
just tons of wildflowers

944
00:47:27,154 --> 00:47:28,500
strewn everywhere.

945
00:47:28,535 --> 00:47:30,019
And butterflies.

946
00:47:30,054 --> 00:47:31,641
Yes.

947
00:47:31,676 --> 00:47:33,505
Lots of butterflies.

948
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,818
And other animals
can come, too.

949
00:47:37,406 --> 00:47:39,649
And I want music
playing all the time.

950
00:47:40,961 --> 00:47:42,825
And I want
Neil Diamond
to write me

951
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,896
a special memoriam
and sing it.

952
00:47:44,931 --> 00:47:46,553
And I want
the Stones to sing,

953
00:47:46,587 --> 00:47:48,348
and Simon and Garfunkel.

954
00:47:48,382 --> 00:47:51,213
And the Vienna Boys Choir.

955
00:47:51,247 --> 00:47:52,283
And me.

956
00:47:57,736 --> 00:48:00,532
♪ Country roads

957
00:48:00,567 --> 00:48:02,776

Definitely you.

966
00:48:29,044 --> 00:48:30,977
Now, what is so morbid
about that?

967
00:48:31,011 --> 00:48:33,945
Nothing. It's like being
buried at Disneyland.

968
00:48:34,463 --> 00:48:35,878
Here it is.

969
00:48:36,499 --> 00:48:38,087
Present for you.

970
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:43,058
What is it?What does it
feel like?

971
00:48:43,092 --> 00:48:45,094
It feels like
a necklace.

972
00:48:45,129 --> 00:48:46,406
They're love beads.

973
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,442
I wore 'em when
I was a hippie

974
00:48:48,477 --> 00:48:50,651
and I want you
to have them.

975
00:48:51,445 --> 00:48:53,758
They look
groovy on you,

976
00:48:53,792 --> 00:48:56,105
especially when
I fix your hair.
Come on.

977
00:48:59,246 --> 00:49:00,385
Sit right here.

978
00:49:08,497 --> 00:49:09,843
Come on.

979
00:49:09,877 --> 00:49:11,017
I don't wanna
look too wild.

980
00:49:11,051 --> 00:49:12,570
No, you won't look
wild at all.

981
00:49:12,604 --> 00:49:15,642
You'll look beautiful
and romantic,
just like Lord Byron.

982
00:49:15,676 --> 00:49:18,369
What did
he look like?I don't know.

983
00:49:18,403 --> 00:49:19,749
God,
I'm hungry.

984
00:49:19,784 --> 00:49:21,510
There should be
a couple of apples
in the fridge.

985
00:49:21,544 --> 00:49:22,752
Good.

986
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:29,587
There's an awful lot
of lettuce, which is not
what I'm dreaming of.

987
00:49:29,621 --> 00:49:31,071
There's only one apple.

988
00:49:31,106 --> 00:49:32,935
Then it's yours.
I'm not hungry.

989
00:49:36,835 --> 00:49:37,975
Mmm.

990
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,702
Now, relax.

991
00:49:41,737 --> 00:49:43,221
This won't hurt
a bit.

992
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:45,706
When were you
a hippie?

993
00:49:45,741 --> 00:49:49,469
Oh, years ago.
When I was a kid.

994
00:49:49,503 --> 00:49:51,712
I guess it was
right after
my marriage.

995
00:49:51,747 --> 00:49:54,370
We used to hang around
the Sunset Strip

996
00:49:54,405 --> 00:49:57,960
and smoke pot
and spit at the cops,
the whole bit.

997
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:01,067
I only did it 'cause
everybody else
was doing it.

998
00:50:01,101 --> 00:50:04,898
And then I stopped
doing it 'cause everybody
else was doing it.

999
00:50:04,932 --> 00:50:07,142
I was losing
my individuality.

1000
00:50:10,938 --> 00:50:11,767
Hmm.

1001
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:12,906
The main thing,
of course,

1002
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:15,978
was to protest
against my mother,

1003
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,393
which didn't work.

1004
00:50:17,428 --> 00:50:18,774
I mean,
I walked in one day

1005
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:20,845
with long, stringy hair
and dirty sandals

1006
00:50:20,879 --> 00:50:23,606
and freaky clothes.
And she loved it.

1007
00:50:23,641 --> 00:50:25,988
The next day, she comes in
with long, stringy hair

1008
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,232
and dirty sandals
and freaky clothes.

1009
00:50:29,198 --> 00:50:30,820
So how do you protest
against somebody

1010
00:50:30,855 --> 00:50:32,512
who's doing
the same thing
you are, right?

1011
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,240
So then...

1012
00:50:36,274 --> 00:50:38,000
I went the other way.

1013
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,140
And I joined
the Young Republicans.

1014
00:50:41,314 --> 00:50:42,349
Another mistake.

1015
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:50,116
Phew!
There's no such thing
as a young Republican.

1016
00:50:54,361 --> 00:50:56,812
Great.

1017
00:50:56,846 --> 00:50:59,953
There.
You look terrific.

1018
00:50:59,987 --> 00:51:03,508
Doesn't look too wild?No! It doesn't
look wild.

1019
00:51:03,543 --> 00:51:06,132
It gives you
charisma.Charisma?

1020
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:07,616
Pizzazz.

1021
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:09,204
Star quality.

1022
00:51:10,446 --> 00:51:12,966
I mean, you don't
even need talent.

1023
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,073
If you have charisma,
they'll line up
for blocks to see you.

1024
00:51:20,456 --> 00:51:21,768
Wow.

1025
00:51:41,028 --> 00:51:42,858
You're beautiful.

1026
00:51:43,824 --> 00:51:46,793
You're a beautiful person
inside and out.

1027
00:51:48,588 --> 00:51:50,624
Well,
I like you too.

1028
00:51:53,869 --> 00:51:58,460
Yesterday,
when I took your hand
and put it on my breast,

1029
00:51:58,494 --> 00:52:00,358
were you shocked?

1030
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,741
Sort of.So was I.

1031
00:52:03,775 --> 00:52:06,261
I don't mean
from the standpoint
of morals or anything.

1032
00:52:06,295 --> 00:52:08,918
I was just sort
of surprised to be
feeling a girl's breast

1033
00:52:08,953 --> 00:52:11,128
when I wasn't
expecting to.

1034
00:52:11,887 --> 00:52:13,164
Well, I'd hate
for you to think

1035
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:15,822
that I go around putting
men's hands on my breasts.

1036
00:52:15,856 --> 00:52:18,204
No, I don't think you
go around doing that.

1037
00:52:18,238 --> 00:52:19,274
Well, I don't.

1038
00:52:21,586 --> 00:52:24,555
I mean, if I want
to go to bed with a guy,

1039
00:52:24,589 --> 00:52:26,073
usually I have
this little smile

1040
00:52:26,108 --> 00:52:28,248
that lets them know
I'm interested.

1041
00:52:28,973 --> 00:52:29,939
Yeah?

1042
00:52:29,974 --> 00:52:32,425
Smile that smile.
I want to feel it.

1043
00:52:32,459 --> 00:52:35,117
That's it?No.

1044
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,670
I can't do it now.

1045
00:52:36,705 --> 00:52:38,258
You're making me laugh.

1046
00:52:38,293 --> 00:52:39,673
I'll do it later.

1047
00:52:41,088 --> 00:52:42,849
But I did have to

1048
00:52:42,883 --> 00:52:45,817
use a different
approach with you,
didn't I?

1049
00:52:47,474 --> 00:52:50,305
Anyway, I didn't
want you to think
I was terrible.

1050
00:52:50,339 --> 00:52:51,340
I didn't.

1051
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:54,309
And I don't.

1052
00:52:55,724 --> 00:52:59,728
Oh,
I hate talking
about sex.

1053
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:04,595
But I did want you
to know that last night,

1054
00:53:04,629 --> 00:53:06,252
you were...

1055
00:53:06,286 --> 00:53:08,012
You were really...

1056
00:53:09,324 --> 00:53:13,776
Like the Fourth of July?Yeah. Like the
Fourth of July.

1057
00:53:13,811 --> 00:53:15,847
And like Christmas.

1058
00:53:18,229 --> 00:53:19,817
Now where are you going?

1059
00:53:19,851 --> 00:53:21,508
I thought
I'd make
some coffee.

1060
00:53:21,543 --> 00:53:23,959
Great. We'll have
breakfast in bed.

1061
00:53:58,304 --> 00:53:59,546
Hello, Mother.

1062
00:53:59,581 --> 00:54:02,239
I'm glad
I found you in,
Donny.

1063
00:54:02,273 --> 00:54:03,792
Jill, this is
my mother.

1064
00:54:06,312 --> 00:54:07,658
Your mother?

1065
00:54:07,692 --> 00:54:09,176
Have I been here
a month?

1066
00:54:10,626 --> 00:54:12,628
DON:
Mother, this is
Mrs. Benson.

1067
00:54:15,217 --> 00:54:16,460
How do you do?

1068
00:54:16,494 --> 00:54:18,531
How do you do,
Mrs. Benson?

1069
00:54:18,565 --> 00:54:20,187
Are you
living here,
too?

1070
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:22,535
Oh, no.
I live next door.

1071
00:54:22,569 --> 00:54:26,263
Um, I just came in
for a cup of coffee,

1072
00:54:26,297 --> 00:54:28,126
uh, yesterday,

1073
00:54:28,161 --> 00:54:31,337
and, um, see,
I had trouble
zipping up my blouse.

1074
00:54:31,371 --> 00:54:32,648
So I see.

1075
00:54:32,683 --> 00:54:34,271
Where is your blouse?

1076
00:54:34,305 --> 00:54:36,963
Oh. Now,
let me see.

1077
00:54:36,997 --> 00:54:38,896
It must be
around here
somewhere.

1078
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:41,519
Oh! Here it is.

1079
00:54:41,554 --> 00:54:44,004
See, I have this
long zipper,

1080
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:45,834
and it's hard
to do up alone. Oh.

1081
00:54:45,868 --> 00:54:48,181
Here.
Put your things on.

1082
00:54:48,215 --> 00:54:50,425
Mother, what...
What are you doing here?

1083
00:54:50,459 --> 00:54:51,529
We had an agreement.

1084
00:54:51,564 --> 00:54:52,910
MRS. BAKER: I was in
the neighborhood.

1085
00:54:52,944 --> 00:54:55,602
You were at Saks,
which is halfway
across town.

1086
00:54:55,637 --> 00:54:56,672
I bought you
some shirts,

1087
00:54:56,707 --> 00:54:57,984
and I thought
you'd have them

1088
00:54:58,018 --> 00:55:00,193
so much sooner
if I brought them myself.

1089
00:55:00,227 --> 00:55:01,919
I don't need
any shirts.

1090
00:55:01,953 --> 00:55:04,611
You just brought them
as an excuse
to come down here.

1091
00:55:04,646 --> 00:55:06,579
Would you mind

1092
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,858
zipping me up?

1093
00:55:09,892 --> 00:55:11,135
Thank you.

1094
00:55:12,516 --> 00:55:14,276
And this is what
you left home for?

1095
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,346
DON: This is it.

1096
00:55:15,381 --> 00:55:17,348
It isn't Buckingham
Palace, is it?

1097
00:55:17,383 --> 00:55:18,832
No. It's
the Taj Mahal.

1098
00:55:18,867 --> 00:55:21,318
Is this where you eat?
On the floor?

1099
00:55:21,352 --> 00:55:23,561
That happens
to be a beach.

1100
00:55:23,596 --> 00:55:25,943
Where did
this furniture
come from?

1101
00:55:25,977 --> 00:55:27,254
Some of it came
with the apartment,

1102
00:55:27,289 --> 00:55:29,533
and the rest
I picked up
at a junk shop.

1103
00:55:29,567 --> 00:55:31,224
Well, don't tell me
which is which.

1104
00:55:31,258 --> 00:55:32,259
Let me guess.

1105
00:55:33,709 --> 00:55:36,850
What in God's name
is this?

1106
00:55:37,817 --> 00:55:40,164
DON: I don't know
what you're looking at.

1107
00:55:40,198 --> 00:55:42,269
I can't describe it.

1108
00:55:42,304 --> 00:55:43,685
It's my apartment.

1109
00:55:44,927 --> 00:55:48,241
Have you ever thought
of hiring a maid,
Mrs. Benson?

1110
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:50,139
I can manage.

1111
00:55:50,174 --> 00:55:52,590
I might be sloppy,
but I'm not dirty.

1112
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:54,592
There's a difference
between sloppy
and dirty.

1113
00:55:54,627 --> 00:55:56,353
I'm so glad
to hear that.

1114
00:55:56,387 --> 00:55:58,665
Has this door
always been open?

1115
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:01,185
No. It's always
been locked.

1116
00:56:01,219 --> 00:56:02,945
I opened it last night.

1117
00:56:03,739 --> 00:56:05,362
What on Earth is that?

1118
00:56:05,396 --> 00:56:06,708
Now what are
you looking at?

1119
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:09,124
That's what
I'd like to know.It's your bed.

1120
00:56:09,158 --> 00:56:10,194
It's my bed.

1121
00:56:10,228 --> 00:56:11,333
Isn't it terrific?

1122
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,853
You actually
sleep up there?

1123
00:56:13,887 --> 00:56:14,716
Like a baby.

1124
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:16,580
What happens
if you fall out?

1125
00:56:16,614 --> 00:56:18,996
I go to the ladder
and climb up again.

1126
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:21,757
Where are
your clothes?In the bathroom.

1127
00:56:21,792 --> 00:56:24,242
And where
is the bathroom,
under the bed?

1128
00:56:24,277 --> 00:56:25,830
That's right.

1129
00:56:28,246 --> 00:56:30,041
Oh, my God.

1130
00:56:34,977 --> 00:56:36,185
Oh.

1131
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:42,916
Wow!
Were you ever right.About what?

1132
00:56:42,951 --> 00:56:44,331
She never
had syphilis.

1133
00:56:44,366 --> 00:56:45,574
I'm surprised
she had you.

1134
00:56:46,817 --> 00:56:48,922
How come
you introduced me
as Mrs. Benson?

1135
00:56:48,957 --> 00:56:50,545
It made you sound
more important.

1136
00:56:55,308 --> 00:56:57,828
What's she doing?Uh, testing the plumbing.

1137
00:56:57,862 --> 00:56:59,277
She's a nut
about plumbing.

1138
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,834
Quiet. Quiet.

1139
00:57:03,868 --> 00:57:05,249
Hey, how did you know
it was your mother?

1140
00:57:05,283 --> 00:57:07,458
I mean, when she came
in here, she didn't
make a sound.

1141
00:57:07,493 --> 00:57:09,495
Smell.
It's called
"Numero Dix".

1142
00:57:09,529 --> 00:57:10,806
She uses
half a bottle
at a time,

1143
00:57:10,841 --> 00:57:13,015
and I always know
when she's around.

1144
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:16,225
Mmm. It's like having
a bell on a cat.

1145
00:57:22,266 --> 00:57:24,337
Now what's she doing?

1146
00:57:24,371 --> 00:57:28,341
Checking
to see I've got enough
socks and underwear.

1147
00:57:28,375 --> 00:57:30,999
No, what she's really doing
is gathering evidence
to hit me with,

1148
00:57:31,033 --> 00:57:32,587
and try to make me
come home.

1149
00:57:32,621 --> 00:57:34,140
She's changed
tactics though.

1150
00:57:34,174 --> 00:57:36,142
She should have
walked in and said,

1151
00:57:36,176 --> 00:57:37,695
"I could
absolutely cry."

1152
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:38,765
She'll say it?

1153
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,870
No. I know
all her routines.

1154
00:57:39,904 --> 00:57:41,078
I know
when she'll say it.

1155
00:57:41,112 --> 00:57:43,529
I'll make you a bet.
How about
dinner tonight?

1156
00:57:43,563 --> 00:57:45,082
Now, if she
doesn't say it,

1157
00:57:45,116 --> 00:57:47,740
then I lose, and we eat
in my place and I pay.

1158
00:57:47,774 --> 00:57:50,674
But if she says it, then
we eat here and you pay.Okay.

1159
00:57:50,708 --> 00:57:52,607
Here she comes.
Quick.

1160
00:57:56,783 --> 00:57:57,888
Well,

1161
00:57:59,096 --> 00:58:00,442
that's
some bathroom.

1162
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,375
No wonder
you hide it
under the bed.

1163
00:58:02,409 --> 00:58:04,101
Gee, I thought
you were gonna
say something else.

1164
00:58:04,135 --> 00:58:06,344
I haven't finished.
I haven't even started.

1165
00:58:06,379 --> 00:58:07,725
Well, say it
and get it
over with.

1166
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,555
There's only
one thing to say.

1167
00:58:09,589 --> 00:58:10,832
Perhaps
it's a blessing

1168
00:58:10,866 --> 00:58:12,868
that you can't see
what you're living in.

1169
00:58:12,903 --> 00:58:14,214
Mother, I count
that blessing

1170
00:58:14,249 --> 00:58:15,733
every time
I walk
in the door.

1171
00:58:15,768 --> 00:58:17,839
Donny,
can I be honest?

1172
00:58:17,873 --> 00:58:19,875
Can you?This is it.

1173
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:22,499
I am shocked
and appalled.

1174
00:58:22,533 --> 00:58:24,362
Oh. I lose.

1175
00:58:24,397 --> 00:58:25,985
At 7:30, okay?Perfect.

1176
00:58:26,019 --> 00:58:28,574
There's no tub
in your bathroom.

1177
00:58:28,608 --> 00:58:30,161
It's under
the dining table.

1178
00:58:36,823 --> 00:58:38,998
I could
absolutely cry.

1179
00:58:39,032 --> 00:58:40,793
Ha, you win. You win!

1180
00:58:40,827 --> 00:58:43,174
Hamburgers, all right?Okay, yeah.
But at least two each.

1181
00:58:43,209 --> 00:58:45,694
I'm not just
talking about
this rat hole, Donny.

1182
00:58:45,729 --> 00:58:46,971
I'm talking about
you, too.

1183
00:58:47,006 --> 00:58:48,973
Look at you.
What is that thing
on your head?

1184
00:58:49,008 --> 00:58:50,423
French foreign
legion cap.

1185
00:58:50,457 --> 00:58:53,046
Oh, have you enlisted?No, I was drafted.

1186
00:58:53,081 --> 00:58:54,772
I'm not
just talking
about that.

1187
00:58:54,807 --> 00:58:56,256
You have lost weight.

1188
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:57,257
I haven't
lost anything.

1189
00:58:57,292 --> 00:58:59,397
I'm the perfect weight
for my height, 6'1",

1190
00:58:59,432 --> 00:59:00,709
and my age, 11.

1191
00:59:00,744 --> 00:59:03,091
Well, I'd just
like to see
what you're eating.

1192
00:59:06,266 --> 00:59:09,925
Why, there's nothing
in here but lettuce,
and an apple.

1193
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,720
Where?

1194
00:59:12,238 --> 00:59:13,480
Behind the lettuce.

1195
00:59:13,515 --> 00:59:14,827
DON: Yeah, I knew
there was another one.

1196
00:59:14,861 --> 00:59:18,002
Tell me,
where is Mr. Benson?

1197
00:59:18,037 --> 00:59:19,383
Who's Mr. Benson?

1198
00:59:19,417 --> 00:59:21,661
I assumed
he was your husband.

1199
00:59:22,386 --> 00:59:24,940
Oh, you mean Jack.

1200
00:59:24,975 --> 00:59:26,942
I don't know. Last time
I saw him, he was standing

1201
00:59:26,977 --> 00:59:29,013
outside the Hamburger
Hamlet on the Strip.

1202
00:59:29,048 --> 00:59:30,014
Why?

1203
00:59:30,049 --> 00:59:32,569
I was curious about
your marital status.

1204
00:59:34,018 --> 00:59:34,950
I haven't any.

1205
00:59:34,985 --> 00:59:36,745
DON: Jill's divorced,
Mother.

1206
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:39,058
Well, how old are you,
Mrs. Benson?

1207
00:59:40,438 --> 00:59:41,750
Nineteen.

1208
00:59:42,095 --> 00:59:43,545
Nineteen,

1209
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,306
and you've already
been married and divorced?

1210
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:47,791
Yeah.

1211
00:59:47,825 --> 00:59:49,586
How long
were you married?

1212
00:59:50,828 --> 00:59:51,933
Six days.

1213
00:59:51,967 --> 00:59:54,763
And on the seventh day
you rested?

1214
00:59:55,937 --> 00:59:57,663
No, I split.

1215
00:59:57,697 --> 01:00:00,286
I gotta change now.
I have an audition.

1216
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,770
Audition for what?

1217
01:00:01,805 --> 01:00:04,290
A play at the
Cosmic Workshop.

1218
01:00:04,324 --> 01:00:06,637
I was speaking
to Mrs. Benson.

1219
01:00:06,672 --> 01:00:08,984
A play at the
Cosmic Workshop.

1220
01:00:10,883 --> 01:00:12,229
Then you're an actress.

1221
01:00:12,919 --> 01:00:14,196
Well, yeah.

1222
01:00:14,231 --> 01:00:16,992
Might I have
seen you in anything,
besides your underwear?

1223
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:22,135
Um, not unless you went
to Beverly Hills High School.

1224
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:23,999
I was in The Mikado.

1225
01:00:25,035 --> 01:00:26,795
I played Yum-Yum.

1226
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:30,040
Yes, I'm sure
you did.

1227
01:00:31,938 --> 01:00:33,975
Does your mother know
where you are?

1228
01:00:35,217 --> 01:00:36,184
Sure.

1229
01:00:36,218 --> 01:00:38,324
And does she approve
of the way you're living?

1230
01:00:40,947 --> 01:00:42,777
What "way"
am I living?

1231
01:00:42,811 --> 01:00:45,572
Mother,
are you conducting
some kind of survey?

1232
01:00:45,607 --> 01:00:48,196
You're asking
for it, Donny.Ho-ho.

1233
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:51,786
I'm sure Mrs. Benson
doesn't mind answering
a few questions,

1234
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:52,994
do you, Mrs. Benson?

1235
01:00:53,028 --> 01:00:55,893
Well, I have
this audition--What does your father do?

1236
01:00:55,928 --> 01:00:57,343
Which one?

1237
01:00:57,377 --> 01:01:00,035
How many fathers
have you?Four.

1238
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:01,623
One real
and three steps.

1239
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:05,075
Your mother's
been married
four times?

1240
01:01:05,109 --> 01:01:06,421
So far.

1241
01:01:06,455 --> 01:01:08,078
We live in
Los Angeles.

1242
01:01:08,112 --> 01:01:11,737
Aw, then you come
from a broken home.

1243
01:01:12,151 --> 01:01:13,428
Several.

1244
01:01:13,462 --> 01:01:16,500
Why does your mother
marry so often?

1245
01:01:17,604 --> 01:01:21,574
I don't know.
I guess she likes it.

1246
01:01:21,608 --> 01:01:23,265
I mean, she likes
getting married.

1247
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:25,820
Obviously,
she doesn't like
being married.

1248
01:01:25,854 --> 01:01:28,374
Now I think I'd better
get started, okay?

1249
01:01:29,064 --> 01:01:30,617
Okay.

1250
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,344
Ciao.

1251
01:01:33,379 --> 01:01:35,139
Don't forget.
7:30. Here.

1252
01:01:35,174 --> 01:01:37,383
What happens
at 7:30, here?

1253
01:01:37,417 --> 01:01:39,178
Jill and I are having
dinner together.

1254
01:01:39,212 --> 01:01:40,420
Mrs. Benson?

1255
01:01:40,455 --> 01:01:42,077
Just the
two of us, alone.

1256
01:01:42,112 --> 01:01:43,596
Mrs. Benson...

1257
01:01:45,011 --> 01:01:46,599
I think you've
forgotten something.

1258
01:01:46,633 --> 01:01:48,843
What is it?Susan Potter's hair.

1259
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,743
JILL: I'm closing
the door.I don't blame you.

1260
01:01:54,745 --> 01:01:57,299
Did you have to be
so goddamn rude?

1261
01:01:57,334 --> 01:01:59,543
Was I rude?

1262
01:01:59,577 --> 01:02:01,027
All those questions.

1263
01:02:01,062 --> 01:02:03,271
What are you,
the attorney general
of Hillsborough?

1264
01:02:03,305 --> 01:02:06,377
I think I have a right
to know something
about my son's friends.

1265
01:02:07,137 --> 01:02:08,379
Rights?

1266
01:02:08,414 --> 01:02:09,795
Let's talk
about my rights.

1267
01:02:09,829 --> 01:02:11,555
You're not supposed
to be here
for another month.

1268
01:02:11,589 --> 01:02:12,729
Why'd you have to
come today?

1269
01:02:12,763 --> 01:02:15,801
Since when do you
speak to me like this?

1270
01:02:15,835 --> 01:02:18,251
Since when do you
come sneaking
into my room like this?

1271
01:02:18,286 --> 01:02:20,909
I didn't sneak in.
The door was unlocked.You could have knocked.

1272
01:02:20,944 --> 01:02:23,636
I thought
it was a raid.It should have been.

1273
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:25,465
Why don't you
lock your door?

1274
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:26,950
Because until I knew
my way around,

1275
01:02:26,984 --> 01:02:29,021
it was easier for me
to let people
come in on their own.

1276
01:02:29,055 --> 01:02:32,058
But I assure you,
it will be locked
from now on.

1277
01:02:33,646 --> 01:02:35,165
Well...

1278
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:36,511
I thought
my coming here today

1279
01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:38,064
was going to be
a pleasant surprise
for you.

1280
01:02:38,099 --> 01:02:40,964
Had I known I'd be
treated like this...You'd have come anyway.

1281
01:02:40,998 --> 01:02:42,586
And I'm glad I did.

1282
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:44,277
My worst fears
have been realized.

1283
01:02:44,312 --> 01:02:45,831
Thank heaven for that.

1284
01:02:45,865 --> 01:02:49,317
My worst fears were
that your worst fears
wouldn't be realized.

1285
01:02:49,351 --> 01:02:51,491
Can you imagine if you
came in here and liked it?

1286
01:02:51,526 --> 01:02:53,321
We'd have nothing
to talk about.

1287
01:02:53,355 --> 01:02:56,565
Did you have to choose
such a sordid neighborhood?

1288
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,740
To me, it looks
just like Hillsborough.

1289
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:01,881
I'd be terrified to live
with the type of people
around here.

1290
01:03:01,916 --> 01:03:04,850
They've been
nice to me.I'll bet they have.

1291
01:03:04,884 --> 01:03:08,750
Yesterday you told me
you didn't even know
Mrs. Benson's name.

1292
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,579
That was yesterday.

1293
01:03:10,614 --> 01:03:14,031
Well, you certainly
became friends
in a hurry, didn't you?

1294
01:03:14,066 --> 01:03:16,275
Yeah. She's a very
friendly girl.

1295
01:03:16,309 --> 01:03:17,621
Yes, I can see she is.

1296
01:03:17,655 --> 01:03:20,486
May I ask you
a personal question?No.

1297
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,143
Have you slept
with this girl?

1298
01:03:22,177 --> 01:03:24,490
I thought you'd never ask.

1299
01:03:25,042 --> 01:03:26,492
Yes, I have.

1300
01:03:27,217 --> 01:03:28,874
As if I didn't know.

1301
01:03:28,908 --> 01:03:30,565
Well, if you know,
then why do you ask?

1302
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:33,844
Now I know why
you were so anxious
to have a place of your own.

1303
01:03:33,879 --> 01:03:35,121
Oh, I know you, Donny.

1304
01:03:35,156 --> 01:03:36,882
You've got that
Linda Fletcher look
on your face again.

1305
01:03:36,916 --> 01:03:39,022
You're going
to fall in love
with this girl, too.

1306
01:03:39,056 --> 01:03:40,092
And if I do?

1307
01:03:40,126 --> 01:03:41,645
Does it bother you
I'm heterosexual?

1308
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:44,993
Mrs. Benson is not exactly
the girl a mother
dreams of for her son.

1309
01:03:45,028 --> 01:03:47,375
I'm not interested
in the girl
of your dreams.

1310
01:03:47,409 --> 01:03:49,411
She's got
beady little eyes,
like a bird,

1311
01:03:49,446 --> 01:03:50,896
and a figure
like a flagpole.

1312
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:53,105
Ah, you've just
described the girl
of my dreams.

1313
01:03:53,139 --> 01:03:56,142
Oh, Donny, you can't
see the difference
between good and bad.

1314
01:03:56,177 --> 01:03:58,006
I can. I can look
into people's faces,

1315
01:03:58,041 --> 01:03:59,421
into their eyes.
You can't.

1316
01:03:59,456 --> 01:04:01,320
But I can see
past their eyes
and into their souls.

1317
01:04:01,354 --> 01:04:04,668
Leave us not forget
Little Donny Dark
and all that vision.

1318
01:04:04,702 --> 01:04:07,222
I wish you did have
some of that vision.

1319
01:04:07,257 --> 01:04:09,466
I'm sure you do,
Mother.

1320
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,054
Deep, deep down,
haven't you always been

1321
01:04:11,088 --> 01:04:12,952
just a little ashamed
that you produced
a blind child?

1322
01:04:12,987 --> 01:04:15,575
There's nothing
to be ashamed of.Embarrassed, then?

1323
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:20,028
You have never
given me reason
to be embarrassed by you.

1324
01:04:25,068 --> 01:04:26,034
Come on in.

1325
01:04:28,312 --> 01:04:30,349
I hate to bother you.

1326
01:04:30,383 --> 01:04:33,386
What is it?Just another zipper.

1327
01:04:36,631 --> 01:04:38,564
Hang in there.
I think
you're winning.

1328
01:04:40,083 --> 01:04:41,808
Thank you so much.

1329
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:48,988
She'll be a big help
to you. She can't even
dress herself.

1330
01:04:49,023 --> 01:04:50,369
Well, that's where
I can help her.

1331
01:04:50,403 --> 01:04:52,889
Donny...
I have a wonderful idea.

1332
01:04:52,923 --> 01:04:54,028
You come home with me.

1333
01:04:54,062 --> 01:04:55,339
I'll have
your bed raised.

1334
01:04:55,374 --> 01:04:56,754
There's a ladder
in the garage...Nice try, Mother.

1335
01:04:56,789 --> 01:04:58,377
It just
wouldn't be the same.

1336
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,034
All right.

1337
01:05:00,068 --> 01:05:05,073
If you insist
on staying here,
I will not support you.

1338
01:05:05,108 --> 01:05:07,558
What are you doing?Calling the Chronicle.
What a story.

1339
01:05:07,593 --> 01:05:09,457
Florence Baker
refuses to help
the handicapped.

1340
01:05:09,491 --> 01:05:11,321
I'm serious, Donny.

1341
01:05:11,355 --> 01:05:13,047
Oh, well,
then I'll call
the New York Times.

1342
01:05:13,081 --> 01:05:15,463
What are you going
to do for money?

1343
01:05:15,497 --> 01:05:18,397
The little you saved
must be gone now.

1344
01:05:18,431 --> 01:05:21,158
I can always walk along
the streets with a tin cup.

1345
01:05:21,193 --> 01:05:22,401
Now you're
embarrassing me.

1346
01:05:22,435 --> 01:05:24,058
No, I'll keep away
from Saks.

1347
01:05:25,473 --> 01:05:27,716
You just stop
all this joking

1348
01:05:27,751 --> 01:05:29,546
and tell me
what your plans are.

1349
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:31,789
I plan to sing
and play the guitar.

1350
01:05:31,824 --> 01:05:34,275
I'm pretty good.
You said so yourself.

1351
01:05:35,828 --> 01:05:38,658
Well, I had no idea
you were planning
to make a career of it.

1352
01:05:38,693 --> 01:05:40,902
Have you any idea
of the competition
you're facing?

1353
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,422
I have just
as good a chance
as anybody else.

1354
01:05:43,456 --> 01:05:46,528
Better.
I have charisma.

1355
01:05:46,563 --> 01:05:50,187
May I ask how you arrived
at this brilliant decision?

1356
01:05:50,222 --> 01:05:51,602
It was elementary,
my dear Mother.

1357
01:05:51,637 --> 01:05:53,432
By the simple
process of elimination.

1358
01:05:53,466 --> 01:05:57,367
Hey, I made a lengthy list
of all the things
I could not do, like, uh...

1359
01:05:57,401 --> 01:05:58,713
Like commercial
airline pilot.

1360
01:05:58,747 --> 01:06:01,026
I doubt that TWA
would be too pleased
at having me

1361
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:04,305
flying their planes,
nor United or Pan Am.

1362
01:06:04,339 --> 01:06:06,721
Photographer?
Mmm, definite out,

1363
01:06:06,755 --> 01:06:09,344
along with ballplayer
and cabdriver.

1364
01:06:09,827 --> 01:06:11,277
Matador?

1365
01:06:11,312 --> 01:06:13,348
Didn't strike me
as too promising.

1366
01:06:13,831 --> 01:06:15,557
Honestly.

1367
01:06:15,592 --> 01:06:17,111
Well, I have considered
becoming an eye doctor,

1368
01:06:17,145 --> 01:06:19,837
but then that would be
a case of the blind
leading the blind.

1369
01:06:21,494 --> 01:06:22,806
That was
a little joke, Mother.

1370
01:06:24,877 --> 01:06:26,258
I said it was little.

1371
01:06:26,292 --> 01:06:29,330
I suppose Linda Fletcher
put this guitar idea

1372
01:06:29,364 --> 01:06:31,228
into your head.

1373
01:06:31,263 --> 01:06:33,334
You might say
she was instrumental.

1374
01:06:34,024 --> 01:06:35,439
Oh, boy.

1375
01:06:35,474 --> 01:06:36,785
That was another joke.

1376
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:38,304
Look, you're gonna
have to start laughing
at something,

1377
01:06:38,339 --> 01:06:39,823
or people are gonna think
you're a lesbian.

1378
01:06:43,344 --> 01:06:47,106
You have certainly
picked up some colorful
language, haven't you?

1379
01:06:47,141 --> 01:06:50,040
You learn everything
down here.Yes.

1380
01:06:50,075 --> 01:06:55,528
Well, I think, young man,
you have learned
just about enough.

1381
01:06:55,563 --> 01:06:58,738
I hardly recognize
my own son.What are you doing?

1382
01:06:58,773 --> 01:07:01,638
What I should have done
long ago. I'm taking you home.

1383
01:07:01,672 --> 01:07:03,640
Forget it, Mother.
There's no way.

1384
01:07:03,674 --> 01:07:05,331
You cannot stay
down here alone.

1385
01:07:05,366 --> 01:07:06,850
I'm not alone.
I have friends.

1386
01:07:06,884 --> 01:07:08,852
You haven't fooled me
with these parties.

1387
01:07:08,886 --> 01:07:11,096
There are no parties.
You have no friends.

1388
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:13,581
I have now.
I have Mrs. Benson.

1389
01:07:13,615 --> 01:07:16,446
You'd be better off
with a seeing-eye dog.

1390
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,550
DON: They're not as much fun.

1391
01:07:17,585 --> 01:07:18,965
Besides, I've got
a seeing-eye mother.

1392
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,175
That's right.
And she's
taking you home.

1393
01:07:21,209 --> 01:07:23,970
Mrs. Benson will just
have to learn
how to dress herself.

1394
01:07:24,005 --> 01:07:25,213
Put the suitcase away.

1395
01:07:25,248 --> 01:07:26,352
Donny, you're coming
home with me!

1396
01:07:26,387 --> 01:07:27,560
Give me that suitcase.

1397
01:07:28,872 --> 01:07:31,771
Where is it?!
Give it to me!

1398
01:07:36,155 --> 01:07:37,743
Give it to me.

1399
01:08:04,183 --> 01:08:05,495
Mom?

1400
01:08:06,496 --> 01:08:08,532
Now, please
stop worrying
about me.

1401
01:08:08,567 --> 01:08:09,637
I'm gonna be all right.

1402
01:08:09,671 --> 01:08:10,776
If the music
doesn't work out,

1403
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:13,434
I can always
study law
or technology.

1404
01:08:13,468 --> 01:08:16,299
There are lots of things
blind people can do today.

1405
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:18,370
Now, please,
stop worrying.

1406
01:08:25,377 --> 01:08:27,206
I've gotta go.

1407
01:08:27,241 --> 01:08:28,794
Thanks for dropping by.

1408
01:08:28,828 --> 01:08:30,036
Where are you going?

1409
01:08:30,071 --> 01:08:31,486
Shopping.

1410
01:08:31,521 --> 01:08:33,799
I told you, I'm having dinner
in tonight with Mrs. Benson.

1411
01:08:34,386 --> 01:08:35,870
Just the two of us,

1412
01:08:35,904 --> 01:08:37,596
ah, alone.

1413
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:39,874
Well, I'll just wait here
until you get back.

1414
01:08:39,908 --> 01:08:41,324
I don't want you
to wait.

1415
01:08:41,358 --> 01:08:43,981
Have a nice trip home.
I'll call you tomorrow.

1416
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:45,707
Now, please...

1417
01:08:45,742 --> 01:08:48,296
I don't want
to smell you here
when I get back.

1418
01:08:48,331 --> 01:08:51,299
And after dinner,
I suppose an orgy?

1419
01:08:51,644 --> 01:08:53,267
I hope so.

1420
01:08:53,301 --> 01:08:55,614
At last,
the sinister truth
is revealed.

1421
01:08:55,648 --> 01:08:58,306
Little Donny Dark
is just a dirty old man.

1422
01:09:16,807 --> 01:09:19,051
Mrs. Benson.

1423
01:09:20,225 --> 01:09:21,536
Yes?

1424
01:09:23,055 --> 01:09:24,815
Oh, Mrs. Benson,

1425
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:27,197
might I speak to you
for a moment, please?

1426
01:09:27,232 --> 01:09:28,785
Well, I have
an audition,

1427
01:09:28,819 --> 01:09:30,476
and I-I should be
leaving soon.

1428
01:09:30,511 --> 01:09:32,547
I don't know this town.
I always get lost.

1429
01:09:32,582 --> 01:09:35,136
Don't worry.
I'll see that you
get off in time.

1430
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,620
Please, come in.
Sit down.

1431
01:09:36,655 --> 01:09:38,484
I thought we might
have a little chat.

1432
01:09:38,519 --> 01:09:40,279
You know,
just girls together.

1433
01:09:40,314 --> 01:09:43,869
Can I get you
coffee? Tea?No, thank you.

1434
01:09:43,903 --> 01:09:47,044
But if that apple's
still there...I'm sure it is.

1435
01:09:48,391 --> 01:09:51,946
Where's Don?Shopping.

1436
01:09:52,533 --> 01:09:54,673
You must be so careful

1437
01:09:54,707 --> 01:09:57,262
to wash fruits
and vegetables
today, you know.

1438
01:09:57,296 --> 01:10:00,541
They spray
those insecticides
all over everything.

1439
01:10:00,575 --> 01:10:04,579
I'm not sure
that the bugs
aren't less harmful.

1440
01:10:04,614 --> 01:10:07,030
I like apples to be
nice and shiny.

1441
01:10:10,861 --> 01:10:13,036
This reminds me
of something.
What is it?

1442
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:14,796
I have no idea.

1443
01:10:16,384 --> 01:10:19,111
You handing me
the apple

1444
01:10:19,145 --> 01:10:21,493
nice and shiny.

1445
01:10:21,527 --> 01:10:23,771
I know.
Snow White.

1446
01:10:23,805 --> 01:10:26,981
Remember when
the witch brought her
the poison apple?

1447
01:10:27,015 --> 01:10:28,603
I'm sorry.

1448
01:10:28,638 --> 01:10:30,950
I didn't mean that
the way it sounded.

1449
01:10:30,985 --> 01:10:32,607
I know you're not
a witch.

1450
01:10:33,159 --> 01:10:34,678
Of course not.

1451
01:10:34,713 --> 01:10:38,061
And I know
you're not
Snow White.

1452
01:10:39,994 --> 01:10:42,341
Yes. Well...

1453
01:10:42,376 --> 01:10:45,206
I certainly have enjoyed
our talk, Mrs. Baker,

1454
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:48,727
And I wish I could
stay longer, but I do
have my audition.

1455
01:10:48,761 --> 01:10:51,385
Listen. My car's
right downstairs.

1456
01:10:51,419 --> 01:10:53,352
I'll drop you,
and we can talk
on the way.

1457
01:10:53,387 --> 01:10:55,837
Oh. You're too kind,
Mrs. Baker.

1458
01:10:55,872 --> 01:10:59,013
I wouldn't dream
of imposing.Oh, you're not imposing.

1459
01:10:59,047 --> 01:11:00,152
I'm free
the whole afternoon.

1460
01:11:00,186 --> 01:11:01,395
No.
Thanks, anyway.

1461
01:11:01,429 --> 01:11:03,051
I have...
I have to have
my lunch first.

1462
01:11:03,086 --> 01:11:04,881
I'd love
to take you
to lunch.

1463
01:11:04,915 --> 01:11:06,572
I know the most wonderful
little restaurant.

1464
01:11:06,607 --> 01:11:08,678
They have the best food.Oh, no, that's...

1465
01:11:08,712 --> 01:11:10,542
No, thanks.Do you like lasagna?

1466
01:11:11,543 --> 01:11:13,372
Is the sky blue?

1467
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:16,168
Well, they make
a lasagna with eight
different cheeses,

1468
01:11:16,202 --> 01:11:18,860
and the sauce
is a state secret.

1469
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:24,590
MRS. BAKER:
How do you manage to keep
your figure, Mrs. Benson?

1470
01:11:24,625 --> 01:11:27,593
I wish you'd
stop calling me
Mrs. Benson.

1471
01:11:27,628 --> 01:11:30,286
That is your name,
isn't it? Mrs. Benson?

1472
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,702
But you don't say it
as though you mean it.

1473
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,049
I'm sorry.

1474
01:11:35,083 --> 01:11:36,671
Suppose,
I call you Jill?

1475
01:11:36,706 --> 01:11:40,123
That's more friendly,
and I'll try to say it
as though I mean it.

1476
01:11:40,157 --> 01:11:41,504
Now, Jill,

1477
01:11:41,538 --> 01:11:44,576
you were telling me
about your childhood.

1478
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,578
I was?

1479
01:11:46,612 --> 01:11:50,064
It must have
been interesting
having so many fathers.

1480
01:11:50,098 --> 01:11:54,379
Well, yes,
actually,
it was.

1481
01:11:54,413 --> 01:11:58,106
But why don't you
get to the point,
Mrs. Baker?

1482
01:11:58,141 --> 01:12:01,455
I know what
it is, anyway.You do?

1483
01:12:01,489 --> 01:12:05,493
Well, I know you didn't
ask me to lunch
to discuss my childhood

1484
01:12:05,528 --> 01:12:07,944
or to tell me
how pretty I am.

1485
01:12:08,565 --> 01:12:09,808
I was interested
in seeing

1486
01:12:09,842 --> 01:12:12,051
what you and Donny
might have in common.

1487
01:12:12,086 --> 01:12:14,502
He likes you
very much.

1488
01:12:14,537 --> 01:12:16,918
Well, I like him
very much.

1489
01:12:16,953 --> 01:12:21,060
He might even be
the most beautiful
person I ever met.

1490
01:12:21,095 --> 01:12:24,547
Just imagine
going through life
never seeing anything.

1491
01:12:24,581 --> 01:12:27,515
Not a flower
or a painting,

1492
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:29,034
or even
a Christmas card.

1493
01:12:30,415 --> 01:12:32,900
Wow!
I'd wanna die.

1494
01:12:32,934 --> 01:12:36,904
But he wants to live.
I mean, really live.

1495
01:12:36,938 --> 01:12:38,526
He can even
kid about it.

1496
01:12:38,561 --> 01:12:40,873
Wow.
He's fantastic.

1497
01:12:40,908 --> 01:12:43,669
Then you would want
what's best for him,
wouldn't you?

1498
01:12:43,704 --> 01:12:46,051
Ah-ha. Now we're
getting to it.

1499
01:12:46,085 --> 01:12:48,018
I knew this lunch
wasn't free.

1500
01:12:48,053 --> 01:12:50,711
Like, maybe I should
ask him to give up
the apartment

1501
01:12:50,745 --> 01:12:52,575
and go home
with you,
is that it?

1502
01:12:52,609 --> 01:12:54,577
Donny was happy at home
until Linda Fletcher

1503
01:12:54,611 --> 01:12:57,752
filled him with ideas
about a place of his own.

1504
01:12:57,787 --> 01:13:02,101
You know, I think that
you believe he can
only be happy with you.

1505
01:13:02,136 --> 01:13:06,002
Well, "There are none
so blind as those
who will not see."

1506
01:13:06,036 --> 01:13:08,625
There. I can quote
Dylan Thomas

1507
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:10,558
and Little
Donny Dark.

1508
01:13:10,593 --> 01:13:13,181
You constantly
astonish me.

1509
01:13:13,216 --> 01:13:16,115
Well, we women
of the world do that.

1510
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:18,359
It's funny how like
Linda you are.

1511
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:21,431
Donny is certainly
consistent with his girls.

1512
01:13:23,053 --> 01:13:25,228
Oh, my God.
It's after 3:00.

1513
01:13:25,262 --> 01:13:27,092
Oh, I'll get
the check.
Waiter?

1514
01:13:27,126 --> 01:13:28,542
Waiter, please.

1515
01:13:31,027 --> 01:13:34,686
I hope you won't
tell Donny that
we had lunch together.

1516
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:37,620
Okay.
But if he asks,
I won't lie.

1517
01:13:37,654 --> 01:13:38,897
MRS. BAKER: He won't ask.

1518
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:42,003
Why do you
call him "Donny"?

1519
01:13:42,038 --> 01:13:43,108
Well,
that's his name.

1520
01:13:43,142 --> 01:13:45,006
Don't I say it
as though I mean it?

1521
01:13:45,041 --> 01:13:46,491
He hates
being called Donny.

1522
01:13:46,525 --> 01:13:47,940
He's never
mentioned it.

1523
01:13:47,975 --> 01:13:51,357
Of course he has.
You just
don't listen.

1524
01:13:51,392 --> 01:13:54,947
There are none
so deaf as those
who will not hear.

1525
01:13:54,982 --> 01:13:57,433
You could make up
a lot of those,
couldn't you?

1526
01:13:57,467 --> 01:14:01,506
There are none
so lame as those
who will not walk.

1527
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:04,405
There are none
so thin as those
who will not eat.

1528
01:14:05,544 --> 01:14:07,201
Do you really,
honestly think

1529
01:14:07,235 --> 01:14:10,273
it's a good idea
for Donny to live
in that place alone?

1530
01:14:10,307 --> 01:14:12,586
Yes, I really,
honestly feel

1531
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:15,140
it's a good idea
for Don to live

1532
01:14:15,174 --> 01:14:16,866
wherever
he wants to.

1533
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:20,421
Anyway, he's not alone.
I'm right next door.

1534
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:21,664
Oh, for how long?

1535
01:14:21,698 --> 01:14:25,391
Do you have a lease
on that apartment?No.

1536
01:14:25,426 --> 01:14:28,049
Then you could
move out tomorrow
if you wanted to.

1537
01:14:28,084 --> 01:14:29,603
That's right.

1538
01:14:29,637 --> 01:14:32,537
You couldn't sustain
a marriage for more than
six days, could you?

1539
01:14:32,571 --> 01:14:34,711
My marriage
doesn't concern you.

1540
01:14:34,746 --> 01:14:37,334
It didn't concern you
much either, did it?

1541
01:14:38,612 --> 01:14:40,027
As a matter of fact,
it did.

1542
01:14:41,649 --> 01:14:44,756
Have you thought
about what marriage
to a blind boy might be like?

1543
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:47,483
Not even your mother's
covered that territory.

1544
01:14:47,517 --> 01:14:49,657
Just leave my mother
out of this!

1545
01:14:58,183 --> 01:14:59,529
I'm sorry.

1546
01:14:59,564 --> 01:15:02,118
I didn't know you were
so touchy about her.

1547
01:15:02,152 --> 01:15:03,395
I'm not touchy
about her.

1548
01:15:03,429 --> 01:15:04,948
I just don't want
to talk about her,
okay?

1549
01:15:04,983 --> 01:15:07,295
All right, we won't.
We'll talk about you.

1550
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:11,403
You've seen Donny
at his best, in that place
that he's memorized.

1551
01:15:11,437 --> 01:15:15,752
He's memorized how many
steps to the drugstore,
to the delicatessen.

1552
01:15:15,787 --> 01:15:18,410
You were probably
very impressed by that.

1553
01:15:18,444 --> 01:15:20,274
But I've seen him
in strange surroundings

1554
01:15:20,308 --> 01:15:21,896
where he didn't know
I was watching him.

1555
01:15:21,931 --> 01:15:23,242
I've seen him lost.

1556
01:15:23,277 --> 01:15:24,692
I've seen him panic.

1557
01:15:24,727 --> 01:15:26,452
He needs someone
who will stay with him,

1558
01:15:26,487 --> 01:15:28,247
and not just for six days.

1559
01:15:28,282 --> 01:15:29,904
Stop worrying,
Mrs. Baker.

1560
01:15:29,939 --> 01:15:33,425
Nothing serious
will develop
between Don and me.

1561
01:15:33,459 --> 01:15:34,875
I'm not built
that way.

1562
01:15:34,909 --> 01:15:36,255
Donny is built
that way.

1563
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:38,810
Oh, please!
We're just having kicks.

1564
01:15:39,189 --> 01:15:40,536
Kicks?

1565
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:42,538
That's the way it started
with Linda Fletcher.

1566
01:15:42,572 --> 01:15:43,987
Just "kicks."
But Donny fell
in love with her.

1567
01:15:44,022 --> 01:15:46,300
He'll fall in love
with you.
Then what happens?

1568
01:15:46,334 --> 01:15:47,715
I don't know.

1569
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:48,716
Well, I do know.

1570
01:15:48,751 --> 01:15:51,305
Stop it now,
before you hurt him.

1571
01:15:51,339 --> 01:15:53,859
What about you?
Aren't you
hurting him?

1572
01:15:53,894 --> 01:15:55,999
I can't.
I can only
irritate him.

1573
01:15:56,034 --> 01:15:57,863
You can hurt him.

1574
01:15:57,898 --> 01:15:59,485
The longer you stay with him,
the harder it will be
for him when you leave.

1575
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,109
And you listen to me.
You let him
come home with me,

1576
01:16:02,143 --> 01:16:04,594
and you go have your kicks
with someone who won't
feel them when you leave.

1577
01:16:04,629 --> 01:16:06,838
I'm not so sure
you can't hurt him.

1578
01:16:06,872 --> 01:16:08,771
Maybe more than anybody.

1579
01:16:08,805 --> 01:16:11,049
I think you deserve
all the credit you can get

1580
01:16:11,083 --> 01:16:12,775
for turning out
a marvelous guy.

1581
01:16:12,809 --> 01:16:15,191
But bringing up a son,
even a blind one,

1582
01:16:15,225 --> 01:16:16,399
is not a lifetime
occupation.

1583
01:16:16,433 --> 01:16:17,883
Oh, you don't know
what you're talking about.

1584
01:16:17,918 --> 01:16:20,437
Now, the more
you help him,
the more you hurt him.

1585
01:16:20,472 --> 01:16:22,508
It was Linda Fletcher,
not you,

1586
01:16:22,543 --> 01:16:24,165
who gave him
what he needed most,

1587
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,098
confidence in himself.

1588
01:16:28,273 --> 01:16:30,206
You're always dwelling
on the negative.

1589
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:32,242
Always what he needs,
never what he wants.

1590
01:16:32,277 --> 01:16:34,451
Always what he can't do,
never what he can.

1591
01:16:34,486 --> 01:16:35,729
What about his music?

1592
01:16:35,763 --> 01:16:37,523
Have you heard
the songs he wrote?

1593
01:16:37,558 --> 01:16:39,698
I'll bet
you didn't even know
he could write songs.

1594
01:16:39,733 --> 01:16:42,080
Well, you might be
dead right about me.

1595
01:16:42,114 --> 01:16:44,220
I'm not
the ideal girl
for Don,

1596
01:16:44,254 --> 01:16:45,704
but I know one thing,

1597
01:16:45,739 --> 01:16:46,843
neither are you!

1598
01:16:46,878 --> 01:16:49,225
And if I'm going
to tell anybody
to go home,

1599
01:16:49,259 --> 01:16:51,054
it's gonna be you,
Mrs. Baker.

1600
01:16:51,089 --> 01:16:52,538
You go home!

1601
01:17:28,989 --> 01:17:30,162
What are you doing?

1602
01:17:30,197 --> 01:17:33,338
I am looking
for some wax paper
to wrap this meat in.

1603
01:17:33,372 --> 01:17:34,684
There is no
wax paper, Mother.

1604
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:36,686
This meat
looks terrible.

1605
01:17:36,721 --> 01:17:38,930
Nobody asked you
to look at it.

1606
01:17:38,964 --> 01:17:40,000
What time is it?

1607
01:17:44,694 --> 01:17:46,696
It's twenty of 10:00.

1608
01:17:46,731 --> 01:17:50,493
Twenty of 10:00?I know. She's unreliable
and undependable.

1609
01:17:50,527 --> 01:17:54,670
What else is new?You did say 7:30.
I heard you.

1610
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:57,258
Why don't you
change your shirt?

1611
01:17:57,293 --> 01:17:59,260
Put on one
of the new ones
I bought you.

1612
01:17:59,295 --> 01:18:01,090
Because I like
this one.

1613
01:18:01,124 --> 01:18:03,368
Listen, you don't
have to hang around,
you know?

1614
01:18:03,402 --> 01:18:06,267
Oh, I'll just
wait here until
she gets back.

1615
01:18:06,302 --> 01:18:08,166
I'm not going
to interfere
with your orgy.

1616
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,996
I told you that.No, I told you that.

01:18:41,268 --> 01:18:44,443
I didn't.
I just asked you.Oh.

1628
01:18:45,651 --> 01:18:46,445
It's good.

1629
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,516
Pretty.

1630
01:18:48,551 --> 01:18:50,173
You mean,
it's pretty good?

1631
01:18:50,208 --> 01:18:52,003
No.

1632
01:18:52,037 --> 01:18:54,937
I mean,
good and pretty.

1633
01:18:54,971 --> 01:18:57,111
Wow.

1634
01:18:57,146 --> 01:19:00,149
Where do you
suppose she is?

1635
01:19:00,183 --> 01:19:01,875
She's probably
still auditioning.

1636
01:19:01,909 --> 01:19:03,186
For eight hours?

1637
01:19:03,221 --> 01:19:06,362
I'm worried about her.You're worried
about Jill?

1638
01:19:06,396 --> 01:19:07,812
Well,
aren't you?

1639
01:19:09,296 --> 01:19:11,056
Something's come
over you.

1640
01:19:11,091 --> 01:19:12,333
I mean, first
you like my song.

1641
01:19:12,368 --> 01:19:13,679
Now you're worried
about Jill?

1642
01:19:13,714 --> 01:19:15,785
And you haven't mentioned
my coming home for hours.

1643
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:16,890
Are you all right?

1644
01:19:16,924 --> 01:19:18,650
Don't I seem
all right?

1645
01:19:18,684 --> 01:19:19,582
No!

1646
01:19:19,616 --> 01:19:22,378
You're not behaving
like Supermom.

1647
01:19:22,412 --> 01:19:24,690
Next thing,
you'll be telling me
you like Jill.

1648
01:19:24,725 --> 01:19:26,416
I don't dislike her.

1649
01:19:26,451 --> 01:19:29,592
I just wish that
she were a different
sort of girl.

1650
01:19:29,626 --> 01:19:30,800
She is a different
sort of girl.

1651
01:19:30,835 --> 01:19:32,353
That's what
you don't like
about her.

1652
01:19:32,388 --> 01:19:35,322
When I was her age,
punctuality
meant something.

1653
01:19:35,356 --> 01:19:37,255
DON: What did it mean?

1654
01:19:37,289 --> 01:19:40,154
It meant if I was going to be
three hours late for dinner,
I'd call and explain.

1655
01:19:40,189 --> 01:19:41,915
You'd never be
three hours late.

1656
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:43,537
No, I certainly
would not.

1657
01:19:43,571 --> 01:19:44,987
You'd be
a month early.

1658
01:19:46,851 --> 01:19:48,507
Maybe she's lost.

1659
01:19:48,542 --> 01:19:51,234
She said she always
loses her way
around San Francisco.

1660
01:19:51,269 --> 01:19:54,030
Any cabdriver
can bring her home.

1661
01:19:54,065 --> 01:19:55,998
She never said
she loses her way
around San Francisco.

1662
01:19:56,032 --> 01:19:57,447
Oh, yes.
She said it to me.

1663
01:19:57,482 --> 01:19:59,622
Well, if she'd have
said it to you,
I'd have heard it.

1664
01:19:59,656 --> 01:20:02,107
Oh, well, I guess
it was after
you went out.

1665
01:20:02,142 --> 01:20:05,007
Was she in here
while I was out?It seems to me she was, yes.

1666
01:20:05,041 --> 01:20:06,560
Why?The usual.

1667
01:20:06,594 --> 01:20:08,182
She wanted
her dress
zipped up.

1668
01:20:08,217 --> 01:20:09,839
You did that
while I was
in here, Mother.

1669
01:20:09,874 --> 01:20:12,497
She just dropped by.
She was only here
for a minute.

1670
01:20:12,531 --> 01:20:15,017
What did you
talk about?I don't remember.

1671
01:20:15,051 --> 01:20:18,089
You remembered
she loses her way. What else
did you talk about?

1672
01:20:18,123 --> 01:20:20,643
What does it matter? If it doesn't matter,
then would you tell me!

1673
01:20:20,677 --> 01:20:22,403
Donny, please
don't shout at me.

1674
01:20:22,438 --> 01:20:24,612
We talked about
Snow White.

1675
01:20:26,269 --> 01:20:27,926
Snow White?

1676
01:20:27,961 --> 01:20:30,826
And the... And the
Seven Dwarfs?
That Snow White?

1677
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:32,482
Is there any other?

1678
01:20:32,517 --> 01:20:34,277
Why were you
talking about her?

1679
01:20:34,312 --> 01:20:35,623
What difference
does it make

1680
01:20:35,658 --> 01:20:37,418
why we were talking
about Snow White?

1681
01:20:37,453 --> 01:20:39,524
We didn't say anything
bad about her.

1682
01:20:39,558 --> 01:20:41,284
I don't want you
talking to my friends

1683
01:20:41,319 --> 01:20:43,217
when I'm not around.

1684
01:20:43,252 --> 01:20:44,840
I'll make
a note of that.

1685
01:20:52,226 --> 01:20:53,434
Donny,

1686
01:20:54,366 --> 01:20:56,713
did Linda Fletcher
give you confidence?

1687
01:20:59,682 --> 01:21:01,408
You know damn well
what Linda gave me,

1688
01:21:01,442 --> 01:21:02,616
so don't try
to be funny.

1689
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:04,514
I wasn't trying
to be funny.

1690
01:21:04,549 --> 01:21:07,448
Did she also
give you confidence?Yes.

1691
01:21:09,036 --> 01:21:10,313
Didn't I?

1692
01:21:11,970 --> 01:21:14,593
You gave me help.

1693
01:21:14,628 --> 01:21:18,943
I always thought
one led to the other.Not necessarily.

1694
01:21:18,977 --> 01:21:23,430
Why didn't you ever
tell me that you don't
like to be called Donny?

1695
01:21:23,464 --> 01:21:25,742
I told you
a thousand times.

1696
01:21:25,777 --> 01:21:29,367
I'd certainly remember
something I've heard
a thousand times.

1697
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:32,957
Well, maybe
it was only 999.

1698
01:21:33,992 --> 01:21:35,131
What's wrong
with Donny?

1699
01:21:35,166 --> 01:21:36,788
Reminds me
of Little Donny Dark.

1700
01:21:36,822 --> 01:21:37,858
What's wrong
with that?

1701
01:21:39,101 --> 01:21:40,481
You work on it.

1702
01:21:41,379 --> 01:21:43,484
What would you like
to be called?

1703
01:21:43,519 --> 01:21:45,314
I'll try to remember.

1704
01:21:45,693 --> 01:21:46,660
Don. Donald.

1705
01:21:46,694 --> 01:21:48,731
You can call me
Sebastian or Irving...

1706
01:21:48,765 --> 01:21:50,802
I don't care.
Anything but Donny.

1707
01:21:50,836 --> 01:21:54,185
I'm certainly
not going to call you
Sebastian or Irving.

1708
01:21:54,219 --> 01:21:56,463
I'll try to remember
to call you Don.

1709
01:22:01,157 --> 01:22:03,159
She's back.

1710
01:22:03,194 --> 01:22:04,505
She'll be in,
in a minute.

1711
01:22:05,092 --> 01:22:06,335
You can go now, Mom.

1712
01:22:06,369 --> 01:22:08,199
There's a man
with her.

1713
01:22:08,233 --> 01:22:09,407
Stop listening
at the door.

1714
01:22:09,441 --> 01:22:10,580
I can't hear
anything.

1715
01:22:10,615 --> 01:22:12,099
They must be
in the living room.

1716
01:22:12,134 --> 01:22:13,238
But there's
a man with her.

1717
01:22:13,273 --> 01:22:14,930
It's probably a radio.

1718
01:22:14,964 --> 01:22:17,553
Why would she be laughing
and talking with a radio?

1719
01:22:17,587 --> 01:22:19,382
Would you please
come away from there?

1720
01:22:19,417 --> 01:22:21,108
I am away
from there.

1721
01:22:23,076 --> 01:22:24,042
DON: Come in.

1722
01:22:24,663 --> 01:22:26,527
Hi. I'm back.

1723
01:22:26,562 --> 01:22:29,116
I brought
Ralph Santori
with me.

1724
01:22:29,151 --> 01:22:30,946
Oh, Mrs. Baker,
you're still here.

1725
01:22:32,119 --> 01:22:34,570
Uh, Don,
this is
Ralph Santori.

1726
01:22:34,604 --> 01:22:36,296
I told you
about him.
He's directing the play.

1727
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:38,125
Glad to
know you, Ralph.Hi, Don.

1728
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:39,299
And, uh,

1729
01:22:39,333 --> 01:22:41,370
this is, uh,
Don's mother,
Mrs. Baker.

1730
01:22:41,404 --> 01:22:43,544
How do you do,
Mrs. Baker?How do you do?

1731
01:22:43,579 --> 01:22:45,201
Don, I told Ralph
all about you.

1732
01:22:45,236 --> 01:22:48,032
He's dying to meet you.Hey, Jill told me,
you know, how, uh...

1733
01:22:48,066 --> 01:22:49,136
How with it
you are.

1734
01:22:49,171 --> 01:22:52,001
How, uh, adept you are
for someone who's...

1735
01:22:52,036 --> 01:22:53,244
Well, for someone
who can't see.

1736
01:22:53,278 --> 01:22:54,452
You can say
"blind," Ralph.

1737
01:22:54,486 --> 01:22:55,798
It's in
my vocabulary, too

1738
01:22:55,832 --> 01:22:57,903
I should have known.
You know, Jill told me...

1739
01:22:57,938 --> 01:23:00,113
She said
how you have no hang-ups
about this thing!

1740
01:23:00,147 --> 01:23:01,390
Ralph, you don't
have to shout.

1741
01:23:01,424 --> 01:23:03,599
Mr. Santori,
my son is not deaf.

1742
01:23:03,633 --> 01:23:06,809
Oh. Sorry.No. It... It happens
all the time.

1743
01:23:06,843 --> 01:23:08,949
People think if you
can't see, you can't hear.

1744
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,571
He can hear a lot
better than we can.Really?

1745
01:23:10,606 --> 01:23:12,332
No, I can't.

1746
01:23:12,366 --> 01:23:15,128
And what a sense
of smell.

1747
01:23:15,162 --> 01:23:16,715
Can I fix you
something
before I leave?

1748
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:18,269
Oh, we've already
had dinner.

1749
01:23:18,303 --> 01:23:20,374
I wouldn't mind
a little cup
of coffee.

1750
01:23:23,308 --> 01:23:25,793
You were expected here
for dinner, Jill.

1751
01:23:28,175 --> 01:23:31,420
Oh, Don.
I'm sorry.It's okay.

1752
01:23:35,286 --> 01:23:37,391
Everything's
so beautiful.

1753
01:23:37,874 --> 01:23:38,910
Candles,

1754
01:23:40,256 --> 01:23:41,809
and our flowers.

1755
01:23:45,572 --> 01:23:49,058
Well, that's me for ya.

1756
01:23:49,093 --> 01:23:50,784
I completely forgot.

1757
01:23:50,818 --> 01:23:53,200
We went to this party
after the audition
to celebrate,

1758
01:23:53,235 --> 01:23:54,650
and we drank
a whole bottle
of champagne,

1759
01:23:54,684 --> 01:23:56,134
or whatever
that was.

1760
01:23:56,169 --> 01:23:57,549
It was
sparkling Burgundy.

1761
01:23:57,584 --> 01:23:59,206
Then, you got
the part?

1762
01:23:59,241 --> 01:24:01,036
Um, yes and no.

1763
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:02,727
I'm not playing
the wife.

1764
01:24:02,761 --> 01:24:04,315
What are you playing,
the homosexual?

1765
01:24:04,349 --> 01:24:05,626
No.

1766
01:24:05,661 --> 01:24:06,765
His secretary.

1767
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,285
It's a small part,
but I have
one good scene.

1768
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:10,804
She gave
a great audition.

1769
01:24:10,838 --> 01:24:12,806
Man, was I
proud of her.

1770
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:13,876
DON: Were you nervous?

1771
01:24:13,910 --> 01:24:14,911
Was I!

1772
01:24:14,946 --> 01:24:16,603
JILL: Uh, it wasn't
the reading or anything,

1773
01:24:16,637 --> 01:24:19,019
but can you just imagine
having to stand there

1774
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:21,918
in front of
all those people
completely naked?

1775
01:24:24,714 --> 01:24:27,614
I'm sorry.
I broke a cup.

1776
01:24:27,648 --> 01:24:29,098
Can I help you?

1777
01:24:29,133 --> 01:24:30,617
No, thank you.

1778
01:24:30,651 --> 01:24:31,997
It's already broken.

1779
01:24:32,964 --> 01:24:35,311
MRS. BAKER: Um,
how many coffees?

1780
01:24:35,346 --> 01:24:36,519
I-I don't
want any.

1781
01:24:36,554 --> 01:24:37,624
None for me.

1782
01:24:41,869 --> 01:24:43,423
Why did Jill have to be
naked for the audition?

1783
01:24:43,457 --> 01:24:46,564
Well, because there's
a lot of nudity
involved in this play.

1784
01:24:46,598 --> 01:24:47,944
We had to see
the actors' bodies.

1785
01:24:47,979 --> 01:24:50,809
You see,
the visual here
is very important.

1786
01:24:50,844 --> 01:24:52,949
I hope
you don't mind
my saying that.

1787
01:24:52,984 --> 01:24:54,951
No, not at all.
Not at all.

1788
01:24:54,986 --> 01:24:57,747
How do you take
your coffee,
Mr. Santori?

1789
01:24:57,782 --> 01:24:59,197
Just black.

1790
01:24:59,232 --> 01:25:02,614
You know,
I don't think anyone
could call me a prude.

1791
01:25:02,649 --> 01:25:05,790
I'd like to
see them try.

1792
01:25:07,447 --> 01:25:09,000
Well,

1793
01:25:09,034 --> 01:25:11,761
at first, I hated
the idea of getting
completely undressed.

1794
01:25:11,796 --> 01:25:13,177
But there were
like, uh,

1795
01:25:13,211 --> 01:25:16,283
twenty or 30 actors there
all around me, all naked.

1796
01:25:16,318 --> 01:25:18,699
And I was
the only one
with clothes on.

1797
01:25:18,734 --> 01:25:20,322
How would you feel?

1798
01:25:20,356 --> 01:25:22,013
Warm, all over.

1799
01:25:22,047 --> 01:25:23,980
RALPH: I was out front
with my writer
and my producer.

1800
01:25:24,015 --> 01:25:25,603
And the minute
we saw Jill naked,

1801
01:25:25,637 --> 01:25:27,501
we knew
she wasn't right
for the lead.

1802
01:25:27,536 --> 01:25:29,227
Tell me,
Mr. Santori,

1803
01:25:29,262 --> 01:25:31,885
is there any story
connected
with this play,

1804
01:25:31,919 --> 01:25:34,129
or is that too much
to hope for?

1805
01:25:34,163 --> 01:25:36,441
There's a very
dramatic story,
Mrs. Baker.

1806
01:25:36,476 --> 01:25:38,236
I die in the end.

1807
01:25:38,271 --> 01:25:40,204
Pneumonia?

1808
01:25:40,238 --> 01:25:41,998
Jill's scene
is gonna be
the wildest thing

1809
01:25:42,033 --> 01:25:44,000
they've ever seen
on any stage.

1810
01:25:44,035 --> 01:25:46,865
I can do this thing
better than anyone
in the business.

1811
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:48,971
She'll be
lying there

1812
01:25:49,005 --> 01:25:49,834
naked

1813
01:25:49,868 --> 01:25:51,318
dying of
an overdose

1814
01:25:51,353 --> 01:25:52,733
of heroin.

1815
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:54,114
Now,
she's in agony,

1816
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:56,427
and she's writhing
across the stage,
on her back

1817
01:25:56,461 --> 01:25:57,531
delirious,

1818
01:25:57,566 --> 01:25:59,154
screaming.

1819
01:25:59,188 --> 01:26:01,984
Do you think
the public
really needs this?

1820
01:26:02,018 --> 01:26:04,952
Are you kidding?
They're dying
for it.

1821
01:26:04,987 --> 01:26:07,300
I'm talking about
the thinking public.

1822
01:26:07,334 --> 01:26:10,855
Not all those giddy little
tight-ass matrons
up in Hillsborough.

1823
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:23,454
Have I said
something wrong?

1824
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:25,766
Pick anything,
Mr. Santori.

1825
01:26:26,974 --> 01:26:29,908
Ralph,
Mrs. Baker lives
in Hillsborough.

1826
01:26:39,642 --> 01:26:42,162
Well...

1827
01:26:44,958 --> 01:26:47,581
Present company
excepted.

1828
01:26:47,616 --> 01:26:48,927
Isn't that
the rule?

1829
01:26:48,962 --> 01:26:51,171
I don't wish to be
excepted, thank you.

1830
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:54,450
Tell me,
what is the name
of your play?

1831
01:26:54,485 --> 01:26:56,003
It's called
Do Unto Others.

1832
01:26:56,038 --> 01:26:58,799
Oh, I must make
a note of that too.

1833
01:26:58,834 --> 01:27:00,698
You might like it,
Mrs. Baker,

1834
01:27:00,732 --> 01:27:02,078
if you just
gave it a chance.

1835
01:27:02,113 --> 01:27:04,529
You know, saw it
with an open mind.

1836
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:08,602
Mom hasn't liked anything
since The Sound of Music.

1837
01:27:08,637 --> 01:27:11,674
Well, I think we just
might be able to make it

1838
01:27:11,709 --> 01:27:13,745
without the support
of Hillsborough.

1839
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:18,233
Good. Because I wouldn't
count on the support
of this "giddy little matron."

1840
01:27:18,267 --> 01:27:22,582
I do not intend to pay money
to see nudity, obscenity,
and degeneracy.

1841
01:27:22,616 --> 01:27:25,481
Mrs. Baker, these things
are all a part of life.

1842
01:27:25,516 --> 01:27:28,450
I know, Mr. Santori.
So is diarrhea,

1843
01:27:28,484 --> 01:27:31,970
but I wouldn't
classify it
as entertainment.

1844
01:27:32,833 --> 01:27:34,766
I think we'd better
get going.

1845
01:27:34,801 --> 01:27:36,458
How long
will it take you
to get packed?

1846
01:27:37,735 --> 01:27:39,771
Oh, not long.
I only have
two bags.

1847
01:27:39,806 --> 01:27:41,117
RALPH: I'll pick up
some food downstairs

1848
01:27:41,152 --> 01:27:43,050
while you're packing,
and I'll meet you at the car.

1849
01:27:44,155 --> 01:27:45,432
You going somewhere?

1850
01:27:46,985 --> 01:27:49,471
Didn't I tell you?
I'm moving in with Ralph.

1851
01:27:49,505 --> 01:27:50,782
I thought
I mentioned it.

1852
01:27:50,817 --> 01:27:52,474
MRS. BAKER: No,

1853
01:27:52,508 --> 01:27:53,544
you didn't.

1854
01:27:53,578 --> 01:27:55,649
JILL:
Well, this place
is so tacky.

1855
01:27:55,684 --> 01:27:57,064
And Ralph thought
it'd be a good idea

1856
01:27:57,099 --> 01:27:59,032
if I moved in
with him.RALPH: It was your idea.

1857
01:27:59,066 --> 01:28:01,621
It really
doesn't matter
whose idea it was.

1858
01:28:01,655 --> 01:28:03,139
It was a good one.

1859
01:28:03,174 --> 01:28:05,245
Hey, Ralph
has a terrific
studio apartment.

1860
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,489
Wait'll you see it.
And we want you
to come over,

1861
01:28:07,523 --> 01:28:08,593
you know,
whenever you like.

1862
01:28:08,628 --> 01:28:09,905
If you're alone
or anything,

1863
01:28:09,939 --> 01:28:12,563
you just come on over.
Right, Ralph?Right.

1864
01:28:12,597 --> 01:28:14,668
I told you
you'd like Don.

1865
01:28:14,703 --> 01:28:16,532
Hey. We'll have
groovy times
over there.

1866
01:28:16,567 --> 01:28:17,982
And you'll
love Ralph.

1867
01:28:18,016 --> 01:28:20,536
He's one of us.
I wish you could
see him.

1868
01:28:20,571 --> 01:28:22,262
He has a great face.

1869
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:26,059
In fact...
Ralph, let Don
feel your face.

1870
01:28:27,336 --> 01:28:29,476
He can tell
what you look like
by feeling your face.

1871
01:28:29,511 --> 01:28:31,167
Go ahead, Don.

1872
01:28:31,202 --> 01:28:32,376
He doesn't want to.

1873
01:28:40,729 --> 01:28:42,420
Well, it's been
great meeting
you, Don.

1874
01:28:43,973 --> 01:28:45,458
See you soon,
I hope.

1875
01:28:47,874 --> 01:28:50,117
RALPH:
It was nice meeting you,
Mrs. Baker.

1876
01:28:50,152 --> 01:28:52,534
I apologize
if I offended you.

1877
01:28:52,568 --> 01:28:54,812
MRS. BAKER:
That's quite all right,
Mr. Santori.

1878
01:28:54,846 --> 01:28:56,952
I can assure you
it won't happen again.

1879
01:29:00,196 --> 01:29:01,266
RALPH: Jill?

1880
01:29:23,875 --> 01:29:26,222
I'll stop in
and say goodbye
before I leave.

1881
01:29:43,654 --> 01:29:45,103
Mom?

1882
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,901
Mom, are you here?Yes.

1883
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:54,043
I have something
I want to tell you.

1884
01:29:54,803 --> 01:29:56,977
Is it something awful?

1885
01:29:57,012 --> 01:29:59,152
No, you'll like it.
But you better sit down.

1886
01:29:59,635 --> 01:30:01,085
I'm sitting.

1887
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:05,330
I want to go home.

1888
01:30:06,677 --> 01:30:08,713
You get the car
and I'll pack.

1889
01:30:11,613 --> 01:30:13,062
Did you hear me?

1890
01:30:13,097 --> 01:30:14,236
Yes.

1891
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:16,065
DON: Then why don't
you say something?

1892
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:18,378
I intend to.

1893
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:20,069
I'm collecting my thoughts.

1894
01:30:20,104 --> 01:30:23,797
Well, do that
while you get the car.
I'll only be a moment.

1895
01:30:24,488 --> 01:30:25,765
Just a minute.

1896
01:30:26,904 --> 01:30:28,561
I think we should
talk about it.

1897
01:30:28,595 --> 01:30:30,494
Talk about it?

1898
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,909
Isn't that
what you wanted?

1899
01:30:31,943 --> 01:30:33,497
Isn't that why
you came down
here today?

1900
01:30:33,531 --> 01:30:35,119
To bring me home?Yes.

1901
01:30:35,153 --> 01:30:36,707
Well, then what's
to talk about?

1902
01:30:36,741 --> 01:30:37,811
We've been
at this all day.

1903
01:30:37,846 --> 01:30:39,468
You said it isn't
Buckingham Palace.

1904
01:30:39,503 --> 01:30:40,918
You said I'm living
in a rat hole.

1905
01:30:40,952 --> 01:30:43,990
And you said
it's the Taj Mahal.

1906
01:30:44,024 --> 01:30:47,372
Are you saying you don't
want me to come home?Oh, no.

1907
01:30:47,407 --> 01:30:49,616
I'm simply saying,
I think we should
talk about it.

1908
01:30:49,651 --> 01:30:50,893
Now,
put the bag down.

1909
01:30:50,928 --> 01:30:53,206
I'm coming home,
Mother.Put it down!

1910
01:30:58,556 --> 01:31:00,696
Please don't
misunderstand me.

1911
01:31:00,731 --> 01:31:03,630
I think this place
is dreadful.

1912
01:31:03,665 --> 01:31:04,873
I doubt that I will
ever like it,

1913
01:31:04,907 --> 01:31:06,495
but I didn't choose
to live here. You did.

1914
01:31:06,530 --> 01:31:09,222
You couldn't wait
to get a place
of your own.

1915
01:31:09,256 --> 01:31:11,811
You rushed into this.
Now you want to rush out.

1916
01:31:11,845 --> 01:31:13,433
I think we should
talk about it.

1917
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:16,125
Isn't it funny
how you and I
think exactly alike

1918
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:18,231
except never
at the same time.

1919
01:31:28,586 --> 01:31:30,381
I can't make it, Mom!

1920
01:31:31,589 --> 01:31:33,349
I just know
I'm not gonna make it.

1921
01:31:35,075 --> 01:31:36,214
Why?

1922
01:31:36,249 --> 01:31:38,838
Because a girl
has walked out on you?

1923
01:31:38,872 --> 01:31:40,840
Two girls.
Let's don't forget Linda.

1924
01:31:40,874 --> 01:31:42,807
And it could be
ten girls.

1925
01:31:42,842 --> 01:31:45,500
Girls walk out on
sighted men too,
you know.

1926
01:31:45,534 --> 01:31:47,536
Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

1927
01:31:47,571 --> 01:31:50,815
Well, it's supposed to
make you stop feeling
sorry for yourself.

1928
01:31:50,850 --> 01:31:52,921
You have
never felt sorry
for yourself before.

1929
01:31:52,955 --> 01:31:54,957
Please don't
start now.

1930
01:31:54,992 --> 01:31:58,064
Oh, Donny, you are
going to meet
so many girls.

1931
01:31:58,098 --> 01:31:59,306
And one day
you'll meet one

1932
01:31:59,341 --> 01:32:01,792
who's capable
of a permanent
relationship.

1933
01:32:01,826 --> 01:32:04,208
Jill isn't.
She knows this
herself.

1934
01:32:07,314 --> 01:32:08,868
I, uh...

1935
01:32:08,902 --> 01:32:10,455
I really think that
you're better off

1936
01:32:10,490 --> 01:32:12,078
staying here
for right now.

1937
01:32:12,112 --> 01:32:14,701
I don't want you
coming home
discouraged and defeated.

1938
01:32:14,736 --> 01:32:16,082
You've got
your music.
You've...

1939
01:32:16,116 --> 01:32:17,670
Christ!
Once and for all,

1940
01:32:17,704 --> 01:32:20,258
will you get it
into your head that
I'm not Little Donny Dark?

1941
01:32:20,293 --> 01:32:23,192
You're goddamned right
I'm discouraged.
I am defeated.

1942
01:32:24,642 --> 01:32:25,850
It's over.

1943
01:32:27,093 --> 01:32:29,854
Do you remember
the first Donny
Dark story?

1944
01:32:31,131 --> 01:32:32,305
No.

1945
01:32:32,857 --> 01:32:34,031
You were five years old.

1946
01:32:34,065 --> 01:32:36,827
We were spending
the summer
at Lake Tahoe.

1947
01:32:36,861 --> 01:32:38,242
Dad took you out
into the lake,

1948
01:32:38,276 --> 01:32:40,002
and it was the
first time that you'd
ever been in any water

1949
01:32:40,037 --> 01:32:42,418
that was deeper
than your bathtub.
You were terrified.

1950
01:32:42,453 --> 01:32:45,214
They could
hear you screaming
all over California.

1951
01:32:45,249 --> 01:32:47,492
Dad brought you in,
and I put you to bed.

1952
01:32:47,527 --> 01:32:49,771
You trembled for hours.
That night
I told you a story

1953
01:32:49,805 --> 01:32:52,118
about a little blind boy
who could swim
the seven seas,

1954
01:32:52,152 --> 01:32:53,913
who could talk
to dolphins...And the dolphins told him

1955
01:32:53,947 --> 01:32:55,362
about the
enemy submarines

1956
01:32:55,397 --> 01:32:57,502
that were coming
to destroy the
United States Navy.

1957
01:32:57,537 --> 01:33:00,816
And Donny Dark swam ashore
just in time to save them.

1958
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:02,991
What a lot of crap.

1959
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:07,064
The next day,
you learned to swim.

1960
01:33:07,996 --> 01:33:09,342
Listen...

1961
01:33:09,376 --> 01:33:10,377
I didn't write
those stories

1962
01:33:10,412 --> 01:33:11,931
hoping for
a Pulitzer prize
in literature.

1963
01:33:11,965 --> 01:33:13,726
I wrote them because
I found a way
of helping you.

1964
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:16,694
Whenever you were
discouraged or defeated,
I told you another story.

1965
01:33:16,729 --> 01:33:18,696
You tried
a little harder,

1966
01:33:18,731 --> 01:33:20,318
and you did
a little better.

1967
01:33:23,632 --> 01:33:25,669
Shall I make up
a story now

1968
01:33:25,703 --> 01:33:29,051
or are you man enough
to handle the situation
yourself?

1969
01:33:31,329 --> 01:33:33,815
A month ago,
you didn't think
I was man enough.

1970
01:33:35,161 --> 01:33:39,717
You said I wasn't ready
to leave home.
Why have you changed?

1971
01:33:41,581 --> 01:33:43,652
I don't know
that I've changed.

1972
01:33:43,687 --> 01:33:46,206
You're not the boy
who left home
a month ago.

1973
01:33:46,241 --> 01:33:48,692
I came down here today
hoping that you were.

1974
01:33:53,869 --> 01:33:55,112
You know, Donny,

1975
01:33:57,390 --> 01:33:59,323
it's not easy to

1976
01:33:59,357 --> 01:34:01,497
adjust to

1977
01:34:01,532 --> 01:34:04,224
not being needed anymore.

1978
01:34:04,259 --> 01:34:07,987
I can do it now.
And you get on
with your own life.

1979
01:34:11,749 --> 01:34:13,371
I'd like to see
you have some...

1980
01:34:13,406 --> 01:34:15,615
Some decent furniture...

1981
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:18,066
Some dishes
and some glasses.

1982
01:34:18,618 --> 01:34:20,033
I'll send some up.

1983
01:34:21,103 --> 01:34:22,104
Okay.

1984
01:34:24,175 --> 01:34:25,418
And linens.

1985
01:34:26,453 --> 01:34:28,248
Bigger ashtrays.

1986
01:34:32,356 --> 01:34:34,116
You know, if you'll

1987
01:34:34,151 --> 01:34:35,600
fix this place up,

1988
01:34:35,635 --> 01:34:37,292
it might not be so bad.

1989
01:34:39,639 --> 01:34:41,848
Could I help you
fix it up a little?

1990
01:34:44,540 --> 01:34:45,956
Sure.

1991
01:34:48,441 --> 01:34:50,477
I'll call you in the morning,
and we'll talk about it.

1992
01:34:53,411 --> 01:34:54,447
Mom?

1993
01:34:59,417 --> 01:35:01,350
I'm glad you came.

1994
01:35:13,466 --> 01:35:15,123
I love you, Don.

1995
01:35:17,125 --> 01:35:18,609
I know, Mom.

1996
01:35:18,643 --> 01:35:21,094
I know you do.

1997
01:36:05,345 --> 01:36:06,864
How're you doin'?

1998
01:36:06,899 --> 01:36:08,176
JILL:
I'll be right in.

1999
01:36:19,049 --> 01:36:22,431
Well... I guess
I got everything.

2000
01:36:22,466 --> 01:36:23,881
Listen, I left
my new dishtowels

2001
01:36:23,916 --> 01:36:25,469
and some light bulbs
in the kitchen,

2002
01:36:25,503 --> 01:36:26,608
if you want 'em.

2003
01:36:26,642 --> 01:36:28,023
Thanks.
I don't need 'em.

2004
01:36:30,267 --> 01:36:33,442
Well, let's not have
any big goodbyes
or anything.

2005
01:36:33,477 --> 01:36:34,927
I'll be in touch
with you.

2006
01:36:34,961 --> 01:36:36,721
Can't you stay
a minute?

2007
01:36:36,756 --> 01:36:38,033
Well, once I'm going
somewhere,

2008
01:36:38,068 --> 01:36:39,759
I like to get going,
you know what I mean?

2009
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:41,485
Sure. I'm the same way.
But I was just going to have

2010
01:36:41,519 --> 01:36:44,868
a corned-beef
sandwich on rye.
Do you want one?

2011
01:36:44,902 --> 01:36:46,801
Well, once I'm going
somewhere,
I like to get going,

2012
01:36:46,835 --> 01:36:50,011
unless somebody offers me
a corned-beef sandwich on rye.

2013
01:36:52,047 --> 01:36:53,255
Um...

2014
01:36:54,429 --> 01:36:56,500
I locked the door
from the inside.

2015
01:36:56,534 --> 01:37:00,159
Will you give the key
to the janitor for me?Sure.

2016
01:37:00,193 --> 01:37:01,643
I'm putting it here
on the table.

2017
01:37:03,093 --> 01:37:05,612
I guess you better have him
lock up that door again.

2018
01:37:05,647 --> 01:37:06,821
No. I'll wait and see
who moves in.

2019
01:37:06,855 --> 01:37:08,339
It might be
someone groovy.

2020
01:37:08,374 --> 01:37:10,721
Oh, yeah.
I hope so.

2021
01:37:10,755 --> 01:37:12,033
DON: You want a beer?

2022
01:37:12,343 --> 01:37:13,344
Yeah.

2023
01:37:14,690 --> 01:37:15,968
The candles
are still lit.

2024
01:37:16,727 --> 01:37:18,004
I'm very religious.

2025
01:37:20,213 --> 01:37:23,492
Where's Mama?She went home.

2026
01:37:23,527 --> 01:37:25,356
What was the verdict?

2027
01:37:25,391 --> 01:37:27,876
She accepted
my declaration
of independence.

2028
01:37:27,911 --> 01:37:30,085
You're kidding?No.

2029
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:31,949
I must say,
she put up
a great battle.

2030
01:37:33,813 --> 01:37:36,057
Maybe she should
have won.

2031
01:37:36,091 --> 01:37:38,197
I mean, maybe
you'd be better off
at home.

2032
01:37:38,231 --> 01:37:39,405
Now, that's a switch.

2033
01:37:40,958 --> 01:37:42,684
Well, I've been
thinking about it.

2034
01:37:42,718 --> 01:37:44,203
Come on, girl.
It took me
a whole day

2035
01:37:44,237 --> 01:37:46,653
and three pints of blood
to convince my mother.

2036
01:37:46,688 --> 01:37:48,241
I don't want to
have to start on you.

2037
01:37:48,276 --> 01:37:50,588
Well, I like
to have things
done for me.

2038
01:37:50,623 --> 01:37:54,213
Well, then give up
Ralph and the play
and move in with my mother.

2039
01:37:54,247 --> 01:37:57,250
Uh, I'm out
of mustard.I don't care.

2040
01:37:59,632 --> 01:38:02,186
What did you think
of Ralph?

2041
01:38:02,635 --> 01:38:04,464
Where are you?

2042
01:38:04,499 --> 01:38:07,053
I'm on the sofa.Huh.

2043
01:38:07,088 --> 01:38:09,297
I couldn't tell where
your voice
was coming from.

2044
01:38:09,331 --> 01:38:10,505
You always
could before.

2045
01:38:10,539 --> 01:38:12,369
I wasn't
concentrating.

2046
01:38:12,403 --> 01:38:13,646
He seemed very nice.

2047
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:15,682
Who?Ralph.

2048
01:38:15,717 --> 01:38:17,443
Oh, you didn't
like him, did you?

2049
01:38:17,477 --> 01:38:18,962
I said he seemed
very nice.

2050
01:38:18,996 --> 01:38:20,549
No, I could tell
you didn't like him.
You were a little uptight...

2051
01:38:20,584 --> 01:38:22,586
I'm always uptight
when there's more than
one person in the room.

2052
01:38:22,620 --> 01:38:24,691
I have to figure out
who's speaking, and if
they're speaking to me.

2053
01:38:24,726 --> 01:38:26,417
I guess you didn't
like him 'cause
he was rude.

2054
01:38:26,452 --> 01:38:30,352
Was he rude?Well, you know, putting down
Hillsborough and your mother.

2055
01:38:30,387 --> 01:38:31,457
That was an accident.

2056
01:38:31,491 --> 01:38:33,390
I'm sorry you think
he's rude.

2057
01:38:33,424 --> 01:38:34,839
I don't think
he's rude.

2058
01:38:34,874 --> 01:38:36,634
Well, you said it.
I didn't.

2059
01:38:36,669 --> 01:38:38,257
Or is there
someone else here?

2060
01:38:38,291 --> 01:38:41,363
Well, I know
he comes off
as a little conceited.

2061
01:38:41,398 --> 01:38:42,847
Tell me, Jill,

2062
01:38:42,882 --> 01:38:44,263
do you like Ralph?

2063
01:38:45,816 --> 01:38:48,957
And what kind
of question is that?

2064
01:38:48,992 --> 01:38:50,476
Well, I'm moving in
with him, aren't I?

2065
01:38:50,510 --> 01:38:53,030
Why would I move in
with a guy
I don't like?

2066
01:38:53,065 --> 01:38:54,894
That was
my next question.

2067
01:38:57,310 --> 01:38:59,381
Well, I'd better
be going.

2068
01:38:59,416 --> 01:39:00,969
Ralph's waiting, and...

2069
01:39:01,004 --> 01:39:02,902
Come to think of it,
I guess I don't like Ralph.

2070
01:39:02,937 --> 01:39:05,180
I knew it all along.
But why?

2071
01:39:05,215 --> 01:39:06,733
Like you said,
he's rude and conceited.

2072
01:39:06,768 --> 01:39:08,666
No. I knew
that's what
you thought,

2073
01:39:08,701 --> 01:39:10,703
but he only
seems that way.

2074
01:39:11,704 --> 01:39:13,948
I really hoped
we could
all be friends.

2075
01:39:14,465 --> 01:39:15,742
Did you really?

2076
01:39:17,675 --> 01:39:19,954
Well, thanks
for the sandwich.

2077
01:39:20,471 --> 01:39:22,094
I better get going.

2078
01:39:22,128 --> 01:39:24,924
I'm gonna tell you something.
You don't like Ralph Santori.

2079
01:39:25,476 --> 01:39:27,375
Oh, God!

2080
01:39:27,409 --> 01:39:28,928
I just packed two bags,

2081
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:31,206
sitting right here,
so I can move in with him.

2082
01:39:31,241 --> 01:39:33,864
I don't care
if you've got 13 trunks.
You don't like him.

2083
01:39:33,898 --> 01:39:36,660
You really are something.

2084
01:39:36,694 --> 01:39:38,282
I mean, you think
just because you're blind,

2085
01:39:38,317 --> 01:39:40,250
you can see
everything.That's right.

2086
01:39:40,284 --> 01:39:41,941
And that sixth sense
we've got tells me

2087
01:39:41,976 --> 01:39:43,080
you don't like
Ralph Santori.

2088
01:39:43,115 --> 01:39:44,771
How about that?
Spooky, isn't it?

2089
01:39:44,806 --> 01:39:46,635
No,
it's just stupid.

2090
01:39:46,670 --> 01:39:49,431
I packed two big bags,
sitting right over there.

2091
01:39:49,466 --> 01:39:51,019
Tell me, Jill...

2092
01:39:51,054 --> 01:39:52,883
With Ralph, is it like
the Fourth of July
and like Christmas?

2093
01:39:55,127 --> 01:39:56,266
Not exactly.

2094
01:39:57,681 --> 01:40:00,339
Uh, he has
a kind of strength.

2095
01:40:01,616 --> 01:40:03,721
With him,
it's more like
Labor Day.

2096
01:40:05,068 --> 01:40:07,346
Do you think
he's a beautiful
person, too?

2097
01:40:08,519 --> 01:40:09,727
In many ways, yes.

2098
01:40:09,762 --> 01:40:11,246
Do you love him?

2099
01:40:11,281 --> 01:40:12,420
Why should I
answer that?

2100
01:40:12,454 --> 01:40:13,593
No matter what I say,

2101
01:40:13,628 --> 01:40:15,009
you've already made up
your own mind about it.

2102
01:40:15,043 --> 01:40:16,803
Go ahead.
Answer it.
Do you love him?

2103
01:40:16,838 --> 01:40:18,046
Yes. In my way.

2104
01:40:18,081 --> 01:40:19,806
Yesterday, you told me
you couldn't love anyone.

2105
01:40:19,841 --> 01:40:21,153
Well, that was
yesterday.

2106
01:40:21,187 --> 01:40:23,017
Look, I'm not
the worldliest human
being on the block,

2107
01:40:23,051 --> 01:40:24,501
but I know
when you're rushing
into the arms of a man

2108
01:40:24,535 --> 01:40:27,987
you love, you don't
stop for a corned-beef
sandwich on rye.

2109
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:29,816
Was it something
my mother said?

2110
01:40:30,783 --> 01:40:32,302
Was what something
your mother said?

2111
01:40:33,441 --> 01:40:34,476
The reason...

2112
01:40:35,615 --> 01:40:36,892
The reason
you're leaving?

2113
01:40:36,927 --> 01:40:38,722
The reason
you didn't show up
for dinner?

2114
01:40:38,756 --> 01:40:41,104
And I know
you didn't forget.

2115
01:40:41,138 --> 01:40:43,002
Was it something
my mother said?

2116
01:40:44,176 --> 01:40:46,730
You don't even
listen to your mother.
Why should I?

2117
01:40:46,764 --> 01:40:48,214
Well, then,
why are you leaving?

2118
01:40:48,249 --> 01:40:50,803
Don't give me
any of that crap
about loving Ralph.

2119
01:40:50,837 --> 01:40:53,254
I'm leaving because
I want to leave.

2120
01:40:53,737 --> 01:40:54,979
I am free,

2121
01:40:55,014 --> 01:40:57,396
and I go when
I want to go,
all right?

2122
01:40:58,845 --> 01:41:00,985
I thought it might
have something
to do with me.

2123
01:41:02,228 --> 01:41:05,542
It has nothing
whatsoever
to do with you.

2124
01:41:06,301 --> 01:41:07,337
Okay.

2125
01:41:10,374 --> 01:41:13,308
You're scared to death
of becoming involved,
aren't you?

2126
01:41:13,343 --> 01:41:15,517
I told you
all about that.

2127
01:41:15,552 --> 01:41:17,036
Oh, that's right.
You told me.

2128
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:19,521
No responsibilities.
No commitments.

2129
01:41:19,556 --> 01:41:22,524
It's just that
I have to be able
to get out, uh,

2130
01:41:22,559 --> 01:41:24,319
if I get tired...Tired of me.

2131
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:26,356
Of anybody.

2132
01:41:26,390 --> 01:41:27,736
What if I got
tired of you?

2133
01:41:28,185 --> 01:41:29,462
Of me?

2134
01:41:29,497 --> 01:41:31,257
Doesn't anyone
ever get tired of you?

2135
01:41:31,292 --> 01:41:35,261
Well, I don't know.
I don't hang around
long enough to find out.

2136
01:41:35,296 --> 01:41:37,298
Oh, and with Ralph,
you could walk out
anytime you feel like it.

2137
01:41:37,332 --> 01:41:39,783
But it might be a little
harder walking out
on a blind guy, right?

2138
01:41:39,817 --> 01:41:41,888
The blindness
has nothing
to do with it.

2139
01:41:41,923 --> 01:41:43,649
You know
goddamned
well it has!

2140
01:41:43,683 --> 01:41:46,479
You wouldn't feel a thing
walking out on Ralph,
or Sebastian, or Irving.

2141
01:41:46,514 --> 01:41:48,136
But walk out on
Little Donny Dark,

2142
01:41:48,171 --> 01:41:49,931
and you might hate yourself,
and you wouldn't like that,
would you?

2143
01:41:49,965 --> 01:41:53,521
Well, hate me or love me.

2144
01:41:53,555 --> 01:41:55,626
But don't leave
because I'm blind.

2145
01:41:55,661 --> 01:41:57,904
And don't stay
because I'm blind.

2146
01:42:02,875 --> 01:42:05,429
Who are Sebastian
and Irving?

2147
01:42:06,741 --> 01:42:08,363
Nobody.

2148
01:42:10,848 --> 01:42:13,403
Sometimes I just
don't understand you.

2149
01:42:14,507 --> 01:42:17,441
I mean, we really
don't think alike,

2150
01:42:17,476 --> 01:42:21,376
and I know
I'd only hurt you
sooner or later.

2151
01:42:21,411 --> 01:42:23,275
And I don't want
to hurt you.

2152
01:42:24,034 --> 01:42:25,069
Why not?

2153
01:42:25,104 --> 01:42:28,142
You can do it to others.
Why am I an exception?

2154
01:42:31,421 --> 01:42:32,836
Becau...

2155
01:42:32,870 --> 01:42:35,666
Well, I just
don't want to be
another Linda Fletcher.

2156
01:42:35,701 --> 01:42:37,634
She hurt you,
didn't she?

2157
01:42:37,668 --> 01:42:39,705
Yes, but she
helped me, too.

2158
01:42:39,739 --> 01:42:41,362
She was there
when I needed her.

2159
01:42:41,396 --> 01:42:42,466
Well...

2160
01:42:42,501 --> 01:42:44,399
I can't
promise that.

2161
01:42:44,434 --> 01:42:47,713
I don't know where
I'll be when you need me.

2162
01:42:50,198 --> 01:42:53,339
Oh, girl, you need me
a hell of a lot more
than I need you.

2163
01:42:53,374 --> 01:42:56,825
I don't need anybody.
I never did,
and I never will.

2164
01:42:59,311 --> 01:43:01,071
I have to go now.

2165
01:43:01,105 --> 01:43:03,901
I'm glad you said,
"have to"
and not "want to."

2166
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:06,180
Well, I finally said
something right.

2167
01:43:10,874 --> 01:43:12,738
I'll be seeing you.

2168
01:43:16,535 --> 01:43:18,744
Yeah, I'll be
seeing you.

2169
01:43:20,401 --> 01:43:22,920
I'll think about you
for years.

2170
01:43:22,955 --> 01:43:25,129
And wonder if you ever
made a commitment.

2171
01:43:25,164 --> 01:43:27,201
If you ever
got involved.

2172
01:43:29,064 --> 01:43:30,445
I hope not.

2173
01:43:33,379 --> 01:43:34,691
Don't worry.

2174
01:43:35,554 --> 01:43:36,865
It won't happen.

2175
01:43:37,590 --> 01:43:40,179
It can't,

2176
01:43:40,214 --> 01:43:43,113
because you're emotionally
retarded. Did you know that?

2177
01:43:43,147 --> 01:43:44,563
That's why
you couldn't
face marriage.

2178
01:43:44,597 --> 01:43:47,186
That's why you can't face
anything permanent,
anything real.

2179
01:43:47,221 --> 01:43:49,119
You're leaving now because
you're afraid you're going
to fall in love with me,

2180
01:43:49,153 --> 01:43:50,983
and you're too adolescent
for that responsibility.

2181
01:43:51,017 --> 01:43:55,125
You're going to stay that way
for the rest of your life,
thinking you're free.

2182
01:43:55,159 --> 01:43:57,472
Oh, God.
I feel sorry for you

2183
01:43:58,887 --> 01:44:00,544
because you're crippled.

2184
01:44:01,304 --> 01:44:02,857
I'd rather be blind.

2185
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:58,775
Taxi!

2186
01:44:58,809 --> 01:45:00,190
RALPH: Hey, Jill!

2187
01:45:06,576 --> 01:45:07,749
Come on.

2188
01:45:27,528 --> 01:45:29,978
♪ I knew the day you met me

2189
01:45:30,013 --> 01:45:34,051
♪ I could love you
if you let me

2190
01:45:34,086 --> 01:45:37,641
♪ Though you touched
my cheek and said

2191
01:45:37,676 --> 01:45:42,370
♪ How easy you'd forget me

2192
01:45:42,405 --> 01:45:47,479
♪ You said
"Butterflies are free"

2193
01:45:53,174 --> 01:45:56,936
♪ And so are we

2194
01:45:59,836 --> 01:46:04,185
♪ On that velvet morning

2195
01:46:04,219 --> 01:46:08,016
♪ When our love was forming

2196
01:46:08,051 --> 01:46:10,536
♪ I said it wouldn't hurt me

2197
01:46:10,571 --> 01:46:13,988
♪ If you left me
without warning

2198
01:47:09,906 --> 01:47:10,907
Who is it?

2199
01:47:11,839 --> 01:47:12,840
Who's there?

2200
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:20,606
The news is good.

2201
01:47:20,641 --> 01:47:22,401
It's not
your mother.

2202
01:47:24,645 --> 01:47:26,405
What are you
doing here?

2203
01:47:28,649 --> 01:47:30,927
What are you doing
on the floor?

2204
01:47:33,688 --> 01:47:35,552
I was just about
to have a picnic.

2205
01:47:38,728 --> 01:47:39,867
Without me?

2206
01:47:42,456 --> 01:47:44,561
I didn't know
I had a choice.

2207
01:47:48,013 --> 01:47:51,188
You're going to be very
proud of me when I tell you
what just happened.

2208
01:47:51,879 --> 01:47:52,949
What?

2209
01:47:53,363 --> 01:47:54,985
Shadow vision.

2210
01:47:56,297 --> 01:47:57,747
What do you mean?

2211
01:47:58,851 --> 01:48:00,612
Well, I can do it.

2212
01:48:00,646 --> 01:48:02,786
I just did it.
It was incredible.

2213
01:48:02,821 --> 01:48:04,961
I came
within one foot
of this obstacle,

2214
01:48:04,995 --> 01:48:06,549
and I stopped cold.

2215
01:48:06,583 --> 01:48:08,102
What was it,
a lamppost?

2216
01:48:09,241 --> 01:48:10,484
No.

2217
01:48:11,761 --> 01:48:13,003
It was Ralph.

2218
01:48:23,186 --> 01:48:25,188
I have
a confession
to make.

2219
01:48:28,087 --> 01:48:29,882
I cheated
just a little.

2220
01:48:31,435 --> 01:48:33,058
My eyes were opened.

2221
01:48:39,443 --> 01:48:41,411
Well,
it's about time.
