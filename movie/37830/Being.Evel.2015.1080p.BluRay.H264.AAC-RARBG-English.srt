1
00:00:14,304 --> 00:00:17,892
The following program is brought
to you in living colour.

2
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,775
Tonight, we have Evel Knievel.

3
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:26,695
He's probably
the only man in history

4
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:29,365
that has become very wealthy
by trying to kill himself.

5
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:31,993
It's true.
He's somewhat of a legend.

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,414
He does incredible stunts
with motorcycles.

7
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:38,960
He has broken, I guess,
more bones

8
00:00:39,127 --> 00:00:40,253
than anybody in history.

9
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,755
Yet he keeps at this.

10
00:00:41,922 --> 00:00:44,842
Let's meet the gentleman.
Here is Evel Knievel.

11
00:00:49,014 --> 00:00:54,897
I grew up in the 70s.
And Evel Knievel was the 70s.

12
00:00:55,063 --> 00:00:59,486
He captured my imagination
like no one else.

13
00:00:59,653 --> 00:01:01,029
Some of you
may have seen this film before.

14
00:01:01,196 --> 00:01:03,950
This is a jump you made
at Caesar's Palace. What happened?

15
00:01:04,116 --> 00:01:07,037
The motorcycle landed short

16
00:01:07,204 --> 00:01:09,790
and ripped the handlebars
out of my hands.

17
00:01:09,957 --> 00:01:14,504
I bounced for 60 yards
into the Dunes parking lot.

18
00:01:17,967 --> 00:01:19,219
God...

19
00:01:19,386 --> 00:01:21,889
you're an incredible man.

20
00:01:22,056 --> 00:01:24,767
I didn't think of him
as a daredevil.

21
00:01:24,934 --> 00:01:27,312
I thought of him
as a superhero.

22
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,733
No one ever went for it
like that before.

23
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,694
He invented that.

24
00:01:33,737 --> 00:01:37,158
Since then, it has taken off
in a major way.

25
00:01:39,244 --> 00:01:41,580
That's such a large part
of our culture now.

26
00:01:41,747 --> 00:01:43,791
He inspired all that.

27
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:46,920
But, there will never
be another Evel.

28
00:01:47,087 --> 00:01:50,091
I've been called a lot of things
by a lot of people,

29
00:01:50,258 --> 00:01:51,926
crazy man, or con man.

30
00:01:52,093 --> 00:01:54,388
But when you head down
that long white line

31
00:01:54,555 --> 00:01:58,017
you better have made your peace
with God and know what you are doing

32
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,521
because a con man
ain't gonna get there.

33
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:04,567
I didn't know...
the story of the man.

34
00:02:05,235 --> 00:02:09,490
And it was, you know,
pretty complex.

35
00:02:09,657 --> 00:02:12,911
California judge has ordered
motorcycle stuntman Evel Knievel

36
00:02:13,078 --> 00:02:16,207
to serve out the rest
of a jail sentence behind bars.

37
00:02:16,374 --> 00:02:19,378
I'm a grown-ass man and...

38
00:02:19,544 --> 00:02:23,049
some of the stuff
is tough to reconcile.

39
00:02:23,716 --> 00:02:25,427
It's a crazy story.

40
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:29,932
It's just fast, faster,
and disaster.

41
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:33,437
LOUD MUSIC

MUSIC CONTINUES

50
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:05,093
I was a member of the sportscasters
association of Los Angeles.

51
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,763
We used to have monthly meetings
on a Thursday

52
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,432
at a place called Red Tractors.

53
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,435
Everybody who was anybody came.

54
00:04:11,602 --> 00:04:14,689
Tommy Lasorda,
Billy Jean King, was there,

55
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:16,858
Muhammad Ali
when he was Cassius Clay

56
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:18,527
first made his appearance here.

57
00:04:18,694 --> 00:04:20,696
They were legitimate athletes

58
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,824
in their chosen professions.

59
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,704
All of a sudden there was this
commotion on Ventura Boulevard.

60
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:30,333
There was this nutcase going up
and down doing wheelies.

61
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,337
I didn't know what a wheelie was
until they explained it to me.

62
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:35,465
People didn't do wheelies
up and down the road.

63
00:04:35,632 --> 00:04:38,010
That was crazy,
on a rear wheel of a motorcycle,

64
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:41,347
going 80 miles per hour
going waaa...

65
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,684
Everybody stopped
and would go "Ohh, look at that!"

66
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,814
Even the hard-bitten sports
announcers of that day and age

67
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:50,192
were taken aback by this guy,

68
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:53,613
who of course turned out
to be Evel Knievel.

69
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,202
If you told me
he was going to be world famous

70
00:04:58,369 --> 00:05:00,413
I would say you're nuts.

71
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:06,295
If you are going to try
and understand Evel,

72
00:05:06,462 --> 00:05:08,882
you got to go back
to his childhood.

73
00:05:09,424 --> 00:05:11,677
His parents split up and left town.

74
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,221
So he was basically raised

75
00:05:13,387 --> 00:05:14,556
by his grandparents.

76
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,394
Grandma and grandpa
did the best they could do.

77
00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:20,855
He was just rambunctious, I guess.

78
00:05:21,022 --> 00:05:25,236
Maybe he didn't have that attention
as a young boy when he needed it.

79
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:29,658
Truth is, Bobby was kind of angry
with his father

80
00:05:29,825 --> 00:05:31,994
because he didn't get
to stay with him.

81
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:33,663
That's what I think.

82
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,583
He wanted to be with his father.

83
00:05:37,376 --> 00:05:39,253
We were up at my grandma's house.

84
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,089
He and I were wrestling around.

85
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:43,008
I punched him in the mouth.

86
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:46,137
He lit on the back of his head.

87
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,765
I said "Bobby..." And nothing.

88
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,726
I thought
"Oh my god, I killed him."

89
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:53,771
And instantly
he had these wild eyes

90
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:55,649
because he knew what had happened.

91
00:05:55,816 --> 00:05:56,859
Across the kitchen

92
00:05:57,025 --> 00:05:59,779
there was a door that was
slightly open, the pantry door.

93
00:05:59,946 --> 00:06:03,742
He ran at that door
and slammed it shut with his head.

94
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:06,204
That half stunned him again.

95
00:06:06,371 --> 00:06:09,625
He turned around sitting down
and he pointed at me.

96
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,585
He said
"Did you see that?

97
00:06:11,752 --> 00:06:14,547
"Nobody can hurt me.
You can't hurt me."

98
00:06:14,714 --> 00:06:16,592
"Nobody can hurt me."

99
00:06:20,138 --> 00:06:22,933
I think
growing up in Butte, Montana

100
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,812
without a father would...

101
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:29,024
would be hard to handle,
I would think.

102
00:06:31,318 --> 00:06:35,532
Butte, Montana
was just a tough-ass mining town.

103
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,245
When the mines were going full
the bars were open 24 hours.

104
00:06:39,412 --> 00:06:41,081
There was a lot of prostitution.

105
00:06:41,248 --> 00:06:43,959
There was about 3000 whores
at that time.

106
00:06:44,126 --> 00:06:46,254
There was just miners
drinking and fighting

107
00:06:47,464 --> 00:06:49,967
You had to learn to cope in Butte.

108
00:06:50,134 --> 00:06:52,887
Sometimes
coping meant with your fists.

109
00:06:53,054 --> 00:06:55,140
You fought.
You stood up like a man.

110
00:06:55,307 --> 00:06:57,184
You fought.
You were taught that.

111
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:59,145
That's part of the Butte credo.

112
00:06:59,312 --> 00:07:00,897
You just don't back down.

113
00:07:02,357 --> 00:07:05,945
Knievel was a fighter
from the get go

114
00:07:06,112 --> 00:07:07,906
even during grade school.

115
00:07:08,073 --> 00:07:09,575
He would get a little obnoxious
at times.

116
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:11,077
You'd have to settle him down.

117
00:07:11,244 --> 00:07:12,579
Well, you couldn't dare him.

118
00:07:12,745 --> 00:07:15,332
If you'd dare him, he'd do it.

119
00:07:17,543 --> 00:07:20,213
I remember
when Bob got his first motorcycle.

120
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,675
I don't know
why he had two tyres.

121
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:24,844
He always rode around
on the back one.

122
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:30,643
You never knew what he was gonna do
with that motorcycle in town.

123
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,855
He would be riding it all over
raising hell with everybody.

124
00:07:34,857 --> 00:07:36,984
He liked to have the cops chase him.

125
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:40,739
You couldn't catch him on a bike
when you were in a patrol car.

126
00:07:46,913 --> 00:07:49,208
One day
I go run up to the store.

127
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:52,837
Who's up there?
Big bad Knievel, you know.

128
00:07:53,004 --> 00:07:56,008
He was a character.

129
00:07:57,093 --> 00:07:59,804
I was scared
but I was kind of flattered.

130
00:07:59,971 --> 00:08:01,932
"Gee, he is paying attention to me."

131
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:06,313
Then one day
he said "You are gonna marry me."

132
00:08:07,522 --> 00:08:10,902
The story is
that he kidnapped her.

133
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,573
I don't know
if he kidnapped her or not.

134
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,702
That might have been something
they were planning together anyhow.

135
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:18,912
Who knows?

136
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:21,290
Yeah, I guess I was kidnapped.

137
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:24,043
I was just walking home from school
that day

138
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,004
when he said
"Get in the car."

139
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:28,591
I don't know it was just...

140
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:32,262
something just almost
overtook me and...

141
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,725
He drove me down to Dillon and...

142
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:38,144
danged if
we didn't get married there.

143
00:08:42,274 --> 00:08:44,360
He had some weird ideas

144
00:08:44,527 --> 00:08:46,989
about how life should be lived.

145
00:08:47,156 --> 00:08:50,869
He thought that he should
be at the top of the heap.

146
00:08:51,035 --> 00:08:55,750
That's why he did the stuff
he did to make money.

147
00:08:57,085 --> 00:08:59,379
He'd run it
if there was a shady side to it.

148
00:08:59,546 --> 00:09:02,049
He was happier if there was
something shady about it.

149
00:09:02,216 --> 00:09:03,426
He made up his own job.

150
00:09:03,593 --> 00:09:07,890
Actually, he started working
as a security officer at night.

151
00:09:08,057 --> 00:09:09,976
He had a route
and used to go around

152
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,145
at 2 o'clock,
3 o'clock in the morning

153
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:14,440
and check all
the different establishments.

154
00:09:14,607 --> 00:09:17,444
You'd pay him to be sure
the doors were locked.

155
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,031
If you didn't pay him
you might be robbed within a month.

156
00:09:21,198 --> 00:09:23,034
He broke into my place.

157
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:26,872
He might've got 40 or 50 dollars
or like that but... nothing big.

158
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,834
Yeah, he ran a racket.
No question about it.

159
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:33,255
The police called me up
and told me

160
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:37,343
that there was a known safe-cracker
in town.

161
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,555
I knew they were talking about Evel.

162
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:40,931
He was a crook.

163
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:44,018
A con-man I guess you'd call him.

164
00:09:44,978 --> 00:09:49,317
At the age of 19
he starts a semi-pro hockey team...

165
00:09:49,484 --> 00:09:52,279
and convinces the Czechoslovakian
national team

166
00:09:52,446 --> 00:09:54,448
to come to Butte to play them.
(Laughs)

167
00:09:54,615 --> 00:09:58,203
And the Czechs kill them.
Like smoke them 22 to 3.

168
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:02,583
But I don't think
Evel was that upset about the score.

169
00:10:03,126 --> 00:10:05,671
I think he left in the middle
of the second period

170
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:09,968
and the money disappeared.
There was no money to pay them.

171
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:12,846
Draw your own conclusions. Where did
the money go?

172
00:10:14,932 --> 00:10:20,189
Butte likes people who bounce up
against the edges of the envelope.

173
00:10:20,356 --> 00:10:23,735
They're forgiving
about some criminal activity.

174
00:10:23,902 --> 00:10:26,697
But they don't particularly
like criminals.

175
00:10:26,864 --> 00:10:28,658
He had three kids at the time.

176
00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:32,329
Threw all of his burglar bags
in the river

177
00:10:32,496 --> 00:10:33,831
and decided to go straight.

178
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:36,960
So Knievel gets this job

179
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:40,631
selling insurance
for Combined Insurance Company.

180
00:10:40,798 --> 00:10:44,344
It was run by this guy,
W. Clement Stone,

181
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:48,892
who wrote a book called 'Success
Through a Positive Mental Attitude'.

182
00:10:49,058 --> 00:10:51,061
I feel happy.
I feel happy.

183
00:10:51,228 --> 00:10:52,938
I feel terrific.

184
00:10:53,105 --> 00:10:56,985
I think it really
changed his thinking drastically.

185
00:10:57,152 --> 00:10:58,904
He was that way to begin with

186
00:10:59,071 --> 00:11:00,448
and it just intensified it.

187
00:11:00,615 --> 00:11:02,993
He was a legendary salesman.

188
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:05,162
When he was selling insurance
he was selling insurance,

189
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:06,372
and he was selling a lot of it.

190
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:10,419
I remember he went
to the mental hospital...

191
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:11,879
I think it was Deer Lodge.

192
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:15,884
And he wrote two hundred and
seventy-one policies

193
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,178
in this hospital...
mental hospital.

194
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,680
It was a super record.

195
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:22,600
Nobody had written
that many policies in a week ever.

196
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:25,521
He talked to the president
of the company at that time

197
00:11:25,688 --> 00:11:27,815
and said "I'll break every record
in the company.

198
00:11:27,982 --> 00:11:29,317
"Every single one that exists.

199
00:11:29,484 --> 00:11:32,112
"You make me a Vice President
after I do that."

200
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,116
And Mr. Stawn says "Sorry,
that isn't going to happen."

201
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:37,536
Well, Knievel didn't like that.

202
00:11:38,454 --> 00:11:42,667
So he picks up his family and
moves to Moses Lake, Washington

203
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:45,379
where he gets a job
selling Honda motorcycles.

204
00:11:45,546 --> 00:11:49,259
He was making a good living at it
but it wasn't good enough for him.

205
00:11:49,426 --> 00:11:53,264
He says "I think
I need to do something... weird.

206
00:11:53,431 --> 00:11:54,766
"Some kind of a stunt

207
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:59,146
"so it'll get people to come down
here and see the motorcycles."

208
00:11:59,313 --> 00:12:02,442
So he had this crazy idea
about doing this jump.

209
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:06,656
He says "I'm gonna jump
over cougars and rattle snakes."

210
00:12:07,115 --> 00:12:09,117
I said "You got to be kidding me!"

211
00:12:09,284 --> 00:12:12,788
My part
in that mountain lion jump was

212
00:12:12,955 --> 00:12:15,917
I wore a white coat like a doctor

213
00:12:16,084 --> 00:12:17,836
and Evel introduced me
as a veterinarian,

214
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,924
which was a crock of bull
but...

215
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,969
So he brings them down
and put the cougars underneath.

216
00:12:24,136 --> 00:12:26,389
They are scared to death.
They won't come out.

217
00:12:26,931 --> 00:12:28,809
They were like kitty cats.

218
00:12:28,975 --> 00:12:30,686
But the snakes! Holy Christ!

219
00:12:30,853 --> 00:12:33,147
We put them
in a big refrigerator carton

220
00:12:33,314 --> 00:12:35,442
and they were pissed off!

221
00:12:35,609 --> 00:12:38,612
He goes around the track
and then he goes up the ramp...

222
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:41,199
The minute he went up in the air
I could see he wasn't gonna make it.

223
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:43,368
My god,
he was about three feet short.

224
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:45,204
His back Tyre
hits a refrigerator carton.

225
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:47,123
The snakes go
flipping into the crowd.

226
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,877
Talk about people
running and getting out of there.

227
00:12:50,043 --> 00:12:52,672
Jesus Christ! (Laughs)

228
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:56,468
The poor guy from Vantage
wants us to help catch his snakes!

229
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:59,931
I says you gotta be kidding me!

230
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:03,852
He just rode back on his motorcycle
and went up the jump

231
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,483
and waved at the crowd.
He didn't care about the snakes.

232
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,904
People started talking to him -
"What can you do next?"

233
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:14,449
And he started
thinking about that kind of stuff.

234
00:13:14,616 --> 00:13:17,787
That's when he come up with the idea
of starting a stunt show.

235
00:13:17,953 --> 00:13:20,999
I told him
"They are going to eat you up, boy.

236
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,292
"You'll never make it."

237
00:13:27,591 --> 00:13:31,262
I was a bartender at Marty's Bar
in Orange, California.

238
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:33,473
And this fella comes in

239
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,186
sits at the end of the bar
and we start talking.

240
00:13:37,353 --> 00:13:41,066
Well, he's a motorcycle daredevil.

241
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:43,694
He had jumped rattle snakes.

242
00:13:43,861 --> 00:13:48,367
He wants to do
a big ramp-to-ramp jump.

243
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:50,494
He said people will go wild.

244
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:52,872
He just convinced me.

245
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,924
Somehow, I was able
to get two pickups,

246
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:04,178
a tractor, and a 40-foot trailer.

247
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:06,389
The logo on the side was

248
00:14:06,556 --> 00:14:10,728
"Evel" Knievel
and His Motorcycle Daredevils.

249
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,693
The name Evel came
from his wild years in Butte.

250
00:14:15,859 --> 00:14:18,154
He was given that name by the cops.

251
00:14:18,321 --> 00:14:21,074
He was in jail
with a guy named Knawful.

252
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:25,121
They said "Well, better lock up
the doors. Pretty good tonight.

253
00:14:25,288 --> 00:14:28,709
"We got an awful Knawful
and an evil Knievel in here."

254
00:14:30,753 --> 00:14:32,505
He heard that and liked that.

255
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:34,967
He changed it to E V E L

256
00:14:35,134 --> 00:14:37,595
because he didn't want
to sound too evil.

257
00:14:42,226 --> 00:14:43,936
He got a bunch of people
working with him.

258
00:14:44,103 --> 00:14:47,065
Good guys like Sweet Savage
and Eddie Mulder

259
00:14:47,232 --> 00:14:48,651
and Klesh Fargo.

260
00:14:48,817 --> 00:14:52,614
So he started
thinking up different stunts to do.

261
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:55,075
The flaming boards...

262
00:14:55,242 --> 00:14:58,872
we'd soak them in gasoline
and light it on fire.

263
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:00,916
And he'd hit that first board
and just go...

264
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:04,796
Boom! The sparks!
The stuff would fly in the air!

265
00:15:04,963 --> 00:15:06,590
Then...
Boom, hit the second one!

266
00:15:06,757 --> 00:15:07,883
The sparks would fly!

267
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,054
Boom! Hit the third one,
the forth one and the fifth one!

268
00:15:11,221 --> 00:15:14,224
Somehow Bob got this midget,

269
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:19,481
Butch Wilhelm, and
talked him into joining the show.

270
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:24,654
Bob said "He will do everything
I do in miniature."

271
00:15:24,821 --> 00:15:28,576
And he would crash
on every single one.

272
00:15:28,742 --> 00:15:31,830
So it looked like
when Bob was going to make his jump

273
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,041
something terrible
is going to happen.

274
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,213
He was such a crazy son of a bitch.

275
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,799
He'd do these stunts
and he never tried them before.

276
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:44,971
One time he had a motorcycle run
at him at about 60 miles per hour

277
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:48,517
and he jumped up,
but he didn't jump high enough.

278
00:15:48,684 --> 00:15:52,856
And the motorcycle hit him
and flipped him over.

279
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,446
He was sprained from his waist
to his ankles.

280
00:15:58,613 --> 00:16:01,200
I think at that point he decided

281
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:04,287
he was going to stick
to jumping with the motorcycles.

282
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,389
The equipment my dad jumped on,

283
00:16:19,556 --> 00:16:22,018
compared
to what is going on today...

284
00:16:22,185 --> 00:16:23,394
unbelievable.

285
00:16:24,104 --> 00:16:25,605
The thing weighed 500 pounds.

286
00:16:25,772 --> 00:16:28,943
It'd be like jumping a dump truck
over all those cars.

287
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,612
But he'd do it anyway.

288
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:32,281
I was the speedometer for Evel.

289
00:16:32,447 --> 00:16:34,241
I'd stand there
and watch him and say

290
00:16:34,408 --> 00:16:37,412
"You're going fast enough"
or "You're not going fast enough."

291
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,040
I guess you'd call it guesswork.

292
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:44,337
Bob jumped further and further
with each show.

293
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,089
The only thing is...

294
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:50,136
those stands were not full,
not by any means.

295
00:16:50,762 --> 00:16:55,184
How do you convince people to come
to a sport they never heard of?

296
00:16:57,729 --> 00:16:59,898
We were 52,000 dollars in debt.

297
00:17:00,065 --> 00:17:02,694
Bob kept spending money
we didn't have.

298
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:06,991
That's when I decided
I had to leave.

299
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:12,289
Of course, then he saw
that he didn't need the team.

300
00:17:12,456 --> 00:17:14,417
He went on his own.

301
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:18,881
Now, it would just be him
looking for his big break.

302
00:17:22,886 --> 00:17:24,262
TV: Spanning the globe...

303
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:28,059
"Spanning the globe to bring you
the constant variety of sport."

304
00:17:28,226 --> 00:17:30,437
For years, I caught myself
singing it in my sleep.

305
00:17:30,604 --> 00:17:32,439
"The thrill of victory
and the agony of defeat."

306
00:17:32,606 --> 00:17:34,108
TV: And the agony of defeat!

307
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:36,403
"The thrill of victory
and the agony of defeat."

308
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:38,405
And they always showed that skier...

309
00:17:38,989 --> 00:17:42,076
where you never knew,
the word was he died.

310
00:17:42,243 --> 00:17:45,247
The crash, that's what you remember
from the Wide World of Sports.

311
00:17:45,414 --> 00:17:47,083
TV: The human drama
of athletic competition!

312
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,253
I remember the crazy stuff
they would show once in a while.

313
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,922
Skate-boarding
was on Wide World of Sports.

314
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:53,174
I remember that.

315
00:17:53,341 --> 00:17:54,842
TV: ABC's Wide World of Sports...

316
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:58,555
We were in the business
of sports theatre.

317
00:17:58,722 --> 00:18:02,018
Sports was drama.
Sports was a story.

318
00:18:04,271 --> 00:18:07,066
I loved it. I covered some
of the weirdest things myself,

319
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:09,277
whatever brought in an audience.

320
00:18:09,444 --> 00:18:10,988
America loved it.

321
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:12,406
TV: The human drama
of athletic competition!

322
00:18:12,573 --> 00:18:13,908
Everybody rushed home from church

323
00:18:14,075 --> 00:18:16,536
and watched ABC's Wide World
of Sports at one o'clock.

324
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,414
That was the biggest show on TV.

325
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,543
TV: ABC's Wide World of Sports!

326
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:25,548
Evel knows that the motorcycle race
at Askot Speedway is featured

327
00:18:25,714 --> 00:18:27,467
on Wide World of Sports.

328
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:32,139
So he fast-talks the owner
into letting him do his thing.

329
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:34,142
Before we get back to racing
I'd like to introduce to you

330
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:35,769
a most unusual young man.

331
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,354
This is Evel Knievel.

332
00:18:37,521 --> 00:18:39,190
His specialty in sports

333
00:18:39,357 --> 00:18:41,901
is to take a motorcycle,
jump over a ramp

334
00:18:42,068 --> 00:18:43,362
and leap through the air 90 feet.

335
00:18:43,528 --> 00:18:44,863
That's what he's going
to try to do today,

336
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,073
over 15 automobiles.

337
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,367
You're trying 15 today?

338
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:49,536
The parachute is ready.
The motorcycle is ready.

339
00:18:49,703 --> 00:18:51,747
And I'm ready.
I'm not gonna miss a day.

340
00:18:52,289 --> 00:18:53,958
He is set to go.

341
00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:57,504
He'll build up speed
as quickly as he can.

342
00:18:57,671 --> 00:18:58,798
Here he goes!

343
00:19:03,345 --> 00:19:04,430
And makes it!

344
00:19:05,765 --> 00:19:06,891
A beautiful leap

345
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:10,729
as Evel Knievel gets the roar of
approval of the crowd here.

346
00:19:11,313 --> 00:19:14,442
Here we are at this Wide World
of Sports' biggest race of the year,

347
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:16,111
biggest track race of the year.

348
00:19:16,278 --> 00:19:17,404
And I won it.

349
00:19:17,571 --> 00:19:20,366
I won the race.
You think anybody remember it?

350
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:21,910
No!

351
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,495
They know Knievel.

352
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,207
They remember Knievel out of that.
Not me.

353
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,668
I rode 100 laps,
rode my ass off.

354
00:19:31,422 --> 00:19:35,469
So Evel got his foot in the door.
Now, he's gonna knock it down.

355
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:44,396
If you could think of the most
outrageous thing you could do

356
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:46,149
what would it be?

357
00:19:46,316 --> 00:19:49,236
It would be jump the fountain
at Caesar's Palace.

358
00:19:50,112 --> 00:19:52,114
I don't know where it came from.

359
00:19:52,281 --> 00:19:55,160
How a guy would go
down Caesar's Palace strip,

360
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,787
look at the fountains...

361
00:19:56,954 --> 00:19:58,497
what was he thinking?

362
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,375
Where did that come from?

363
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:02,544
Evel wants to do this stunt
in Vegas.

364
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:04,964
But no one knows
who the hell he is.

365
00:20:05,131 --> 00:20:07,217
So he switches into hustler mode.

366
00:20:07,384 --> 00:20:09,595
This guy called every news outlet,

367
00:20:09,762 --> 00:20:13,683
told them that Evel Knievel,
famed stunt motorcyclist

368
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:18,856
was gonna jump Caesar's Palace
come Saturday morning. Be there.

369
00:20:19,023 --> 00:20:22,569
So then he calls Jay Sarno,
the guy who runs Caesar's.

370
00:20:22,736 --> 00:20:25,281
Each time, he would call
as a different person.

371
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:28,619
Each time,
he would mispronounce his own name.

372
00:20:28,785 --> 00:20:31,330
I told him my name was Larson,
I was with Sports Illustrated.

373
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:32,874
I said "You ever heard
of Evel Nievel?"

374
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,043
He said "Evel Nievel?
Who the hell is this Evel Nievel?"

375
00:20:35,753 --> 00:20:37,588
I waited two more days,
called him back up

376
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:39,382
and said "It's Dennis Houlan
from Wide World of Sports.

377
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:40,634
"Do you know Evel Knievel?"

378
00:20:40,801 --> 00:20:42,511
He says
"Evel Nevel? Evel Knievel?

379
00:20:42,678 --> 00:20:45,264
"Who is this crazy guy?
Everyone is calling me up about him.

380
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:47,851
"I think we have a deal with him,
I don't know. Call back." (Laughs)

381
00:20:48,018 --> 00:20:49,854
AUDIENCE LAUGHS

382
00:20:52,148 --> 00:20:53,650
Like a lot of his stunts

383
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:57,363
Caesar's Palace was one of those
that he dreamed up and sold

384
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,073
before he even knew
it was possible.

385
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,244
Then on the day
he's got the crowds there.

386
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:04,205
He doesn't know
if he can make it.

387
00:21:04,372 --> 00:21:06,374
He's just got to go for it.

388
00:21:08,043 --> 00:21:11,005
I talked with him for a while
before he jumped.

389
00:21:11,172 --> 00:21:14,134
He was very unsettled
about the jump.

390
00:21:14,301 --> 00:21:16,095
You could tell he was nervous.

391
00:21:20,726 --> 00:21:23,145
He was making runs at the ramp.

392
00:21:23,312 --> 00:21:26,775
We could hear the motorcycle.
We could hear the crowd.

393
00:21:26,942 --> 00:21:28,694
Then the doorman...

394
00:21:28,861 --> 00:21:31,906
got on the phone
and told us what went on.

395
00:21:42,586 --> 00:21:45,966
My god,
that was horrible.

396
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:48,385
I thought he was dead.

397
00:21:48,552 --> 00:21:50,221
I was horrified

398
00:21:50,388 --> 00:21:52,724
to watch my friend
look like a rag doll.

399
00:22:22,887 --> 00:22:25,056
I don't think he was unconscious.

400
00:22:26,308 --> 00:22:27,851
But he was hurting.

401
00:22:28,018 --> 00:22:30,980
So off to the hospital we went.

402
00:22:31,147 --> 00:22:32,941
He had a broken wrist,

403
00:22:33,108 --> 00:22:36,237
two broken ankles,
crushed his pelvis...

404
00:22:36,404 --> 00:22:39,825
Then somehow, word gets out

405
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:42,954
that he is in a coma
and might not make it.

406
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:46,708
He told that story.
But he wasn't in a coma.

407
00:22:47,418 --> 00:22:48,711
I flew down there.

408
00:22:48,878 --> 00:22:53,008
It hadn't been but like two days
since he had the wreck

409
00:22:53,175 --> 00:22:55,011
and he was awake
when I walked in the hospital room.

410
00:22:56,638 --> 00:22:58,098
He had the press come in there

411
00:22:58,265 --> 00:22:59,850
and play it up -
"Oh I'm about to die.

412
00:23:00,017 --> 00:23:01,394
"I don't know
if I'm going to make it."

413
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,729
This is Knievel.
This is what he did.

414
00:23:02,895 --> 00:23:04,272
He played it up right to the end.

415
00:23:05,857 --> 00:23:08,903
Pretty soon
the crash footage was everywhere.

416
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,281
We saw him jump Caesar's Palace.

417
00:23:11,448 --> 00:23:15,453
We saw that fall and his body
flopping and his head hitting...

418
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,124
all of the agony of that
and the broken bones.

419
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:21,127
That piece of film was amazing.

420
00:23:21,293 --> 00:23:23,046
To see him go over and over

421
00:23:23,213 --> 00:23:26,550
and roll all the way up
to the wall...

422
00:23:26,717 --> 00:23:29,262
that's one of the great pieces
of footage of all time.

423
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:32,766
He was national news
all over the place.

424
00:23:35,687 --> 00:23:37,647
He became instantly famous.

425
00:23:39,024 --> 00:23:42,904
This guy somehow captured
what America needed.

426
00:23:43,071 --> 00:23:45,115
He came along at the right time.

427
00:23:51,748 --> 00:23:55,503
There was a certain cynicism
throughout the country.

428
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,589
Society was changing.

429
00:23:57,756 --> 00:23:59,717
You had corruption in government.

430
00:23:59,884 --> 00:24:00,968
Well, I'm not a crook.

431
00:24:03,221 --> 00:24:08,686
The country had been battered
by many years of war.

432
00:24:08,853 --> 00:24:12,107
America was coming apart
at the seams.

433
00:24:12,733 --> 00:24:20,618
♪ Must be the season of the witch.
♪ Must be the season of the witch.

434
00:24:20,785 --> 00:24:23,872
We were a little down on ourselves.

435
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:26,542
Along comes this kid
from Butte, Montana,

436
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:30,380
who showed us who we were
and wanted to be again.

437
00:24:30,547 --> 00:24:34,761
♪ He wears red, white and blue,
stars and stripes, too. ♪

438
00:24:34,927 --> 00:24:39,642
I guess we were looking
for some sort of a hero.

439
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:43,021
We had Superman and Batman...

440
00:24:43,188 --> 00:24:45,190
But this guy was the real thing.

441
00:24:45,357 --> 00:24:49,195
♪ Evel Knievel
For God and country too

442
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,740
Most motorcycle people wore black.

443
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,243
That is what Evel wanted to change.

444
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,205
That's where the red, white,
and blue letters came from.

445
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:58,874
He wore red, white and blue

446
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:01,544
because he was patriotic.

447
00:25:01,711 --> 00:25:03,755
He loved his country.

448
00:25:03,922 --> 00:25:08,636
But he also saw that it would
give him a boost with his image

449
00:25:08,803 --> 00:25:11,348
and people were respecting him more.

450
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:16,354
He came out of those mounts in
his star-spangled suit and his cane.

451
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:17,564
And he said

452
00:25:17,731 --> 00:25:20,026
"I am going to face death."

453
00:25:20,193 --> 00:25:22,904
He opened the door
and invited people

454
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:26,242
to buy a ticket to watch truth.

455
00:25:27,785 --> 00:25:31,707
For that disenchanted,
disillusioned generation,

456
00:25:31,874 --> 00:25:34,502
where you didn't trust anybody
because even the president lied

457
00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:38,007
here's a guy...
he's gonna risk everything.

458
00:25:41,928 --> 00:25:43,388
He did it! Wow!

459
00:25:43,555 --> 00:25:45,307
He did it! Yeah!

460
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:53,359
There was three TV stations
back then.

461
00:25:53,526 --> 00:25:57,072
When Evel was on ABC
everyone knew it.

462
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:59,158
That's what you did that night,
is watch...

463
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:02,663
That's what you talked about
for the next few weeks afterwards.

464
00:26:03,705 --> 00:26:05,040
He was so popular

465
00:26:05,207 --> 00:26:08,628
that out of the top ten-rated
Wide World of Sports shows

466
00:26:08,795 --> 00:26:11,090
in the 37 years of the show

467
00:26:11,716 --> 00:26:13,843
he holds seven of them.

468
00:26:15,011 --> 00:26:17,014
TV: Motorcycle daredevil,
Evel Knievel!

469
00:26:17,181 --> 00:26:18,933
He was the talk of the world.

470
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,855
He was the greatest reality show
before reality shows existed.

471
00:26:23,021 --> 00:26:25,358
Are you scared before a stunt?

472
00:26:25,525 --> 00:26:26,567
Do you have fear?

473
00:26:26,734 --> 00:26:28,945
I am not scared.
When I go out for that jump

474
00:26:29,112 --> 00:26:30,155
I must say I have some concern

475
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,408
but I don't think
I've ever been afraid of anything.

476
00:26:32,575 --> 00:26:35,370
If I know something is going to
happen, I try and train myself

477
00:26:35,537 --> 00:26:37,790
to where I have complete control
over my mind and my body.

478
00:26:37,957 --> 00:26:40,961
I relax when I hit instead
of freezing up and being scared.

479
00:26:41,127 --> 00:26:44,298
He said to me "You know
what I was really good at?

480
00:26:44,465 --> 00:26:45,842
"Was the take-off.

481
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:48,470
"You know what I was bad at
was the landing."

482
00:26:48,637 --> 00:26:51,140
But he said
that it was the bad landings

483
00:26:51,307 --> 00:26:53,059
that's what brought the crowds out.

484
00:26:53,893 --> 00:26:56,897
Bobby used to say
nobody wants to see me die

485
00:26:57,064 --> 00:26:59,776
but they don't want to miss it
if I do.

486
00:26:59,943 --> 00:27:03,489
ANNOUNCER: Just to go up that ramp
and take a look at the distance

487
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:08,328
that he has got to hurdle
aboard his Harley Davidson machine...

488
00:27:08,871 --> 00:27:11,666
He knew that if he wasn't perfect
when he left that ramp,

489
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:14,044
something awful
was going to happen

490
00:27:14,211 --> 00:27:18,132
between the time he left there
and came down way over here.

491
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:20,927
If he told you he was going
to do something, he'd do it.

492
00:27:21,094 --> 00:27:23,764
Even if he knew
it was going to kill him.

493
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:43,247
You were always the question of...

494
00:27:43,414 --> 00:27:46,167
whether or not
he might not make it alive.

495
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:49,380
I would think my dad would die
every time he jumped.

496
00:27:50,214 --> 00:27:52,592
It was stressful.
It was hard on us.

497
00:27:53,468 --> 00:27:56,764
If he crashed
and got hurt

498
00:27:56,931 --> 00:27:58,683
then he'd go out
and gonna do it again.

499
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:01,729
Everyone says "He's nuts.
He got hurt the last time."

500
00:28:02,813 --> 00:28:05,734
Doctors, especially surgeons,
have been amazed

501
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,237
at how I can keep going.

502
00:28:08,404 --> 00:28:14,912
He had recuperative powers
that were beyond normal people.

503
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:18,666
They'd say "You'll have this cast
for eight weeks" and... (Laughs)

504
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:20,961
He would take it off in three.

505
00:28:21,128 --> 00:28:23,297
This may look
like just some abstract plumbing.

506
00:28:23,464 --> 00:28:28,053
But this is actually the right hip
and right femur of Evel Knievel...

507
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,932
I think I have probably
become immune to pain.

508
00:28:31,099 --> 00:28:35,312
I've learned to live with pain
for so long that I think...

509
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:38,399
what would hurt an average person
doesn't hurt me so much.

510
00:28:38,942 --> 00:28:42,071
When we were growing up and my dad
broke bones and he was in pain

511
00:28:42,238 --> 00:28:44,908
he never bitched about it,
he never complained about it.

512
00:28:45,075 --> 00:28:47,828
No, no, I'll be all right.
I'm gonna jump some more.

513
00:28:47,995 --> 00:28:50,999
He accepted that
that's what he had chosen to do.

514
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:52,751
It's something
he just had to deal with.

515
00:28:52,918 --> 00:28:55,463
That's the way he dealt with it.

516
00:28:58,925 --> 00:29:01,053
To be something,
a little extra special,

517
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,930
no matter what I want to do,
if I like to do it.

518
00:29:03,097 --> 00:29:05,100
To be a champion, to be the best.

519
00:29:05,267 --> 00:29:07,519
Even though I have been hurt
so many times.

520
00:29:07,686 --> 00:29:09,689
And live
like a lot of people do,

521
00:29:09,856 --> 00:29:12,317
live in a...

522
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:15,112
a Grey twilight world,

523
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,991
these kind of people
don't even know victory or defeat

524
00:29:18,158 --> 00:29:19,660
because they have never
tried anything.

525
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:22,538
This is something
I feel compelled to do.

526
00:29:22,705 --> 00:29:24,958
And I am going to do it.

527
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,094
I had sort of been brought along
the way of a teen idol.

528
00:29:34,261 --> 00:29:35,221
Mm-mm!

529
00:29:35,388 --> 00:29:39,977
I had enough star power going but
I kept trying to toughen up my act.

530
00:29:40,144 --> 00:29:42,647
I thought "God, if I could
get a really good Western

531
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:43,940
"or a good action movie..."

532
00:29:44,107 --> 00:29:47,236
I was looking for a sort of
modern-day Western character,

533
00:29:47,403 --> 00:29:49,113
who would that be?

534
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,452
I remember seeing the footage
from Caesar's Palace.

535
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:55,705
I thought "Yeah, that's the movie."

536
00:29:56,247 --> 00:29:59,084
In my mind, there was only one guy
that could do this right.

537
00:29:59,251 --> 00:30:01,462
John Milius,
he had written 'Dirty Harry'

538
00:30:01,629 --> 00:30:03,256
'Jeremiah Johnson'

539
00:30:03,423 --> 00:30:06,176
and of course later
'Apocalypse Now'.

540
00:30:06,343 --> 00:30:09,389
Milius just wrote it as if
he was writing for 'Patton'.

541
00:30:09,555 --> 00:30:12,142
It had this sort
of mythic sound to it.

542
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:15,354
It has got this man
who thinks he is a gladiator.

543
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:18,525
I was excited to show Evel this.

544
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,070
He tells me to come meet him
in Hollywood

545
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:24,992
at the Saharan Motel,
that was up on Sunset.

546
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:26,619
He's been up all night,

547
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:30,081
got another huge wound,
kotex pads all in there.

548
00:30:30,248 --> 00:30:32,668
He's lying there
like a pasha in a bad motel.

549
00:30:32,835 --> 00:30:35,380
That's when it all got crazy.

550
00:30:35,546 --> 00:30:38,926
He took a bottle of the Wild Turkey
and I heard the snap of the Turkey.

551
00:30:39,093 --> 00:30:41,387
He drank half that thing down
and he said "Siddown".

552
00:30:41,554 --> 00:30:43,890
I said "We've got a great script"

553
00:30:44,057 --> 00:30:45,809
"I want you to read it."

554
00:30:45,976 --> 00:30:47,395
He said "You read it."

555
00:30:47,561 --> 00:30:49,272
I said "Well, I have read it.

556
00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:50,732
"I really love it.
I think it's great."

557
00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:52,818
He said
"No, I want you to read it to me."

558
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:55,363
I just didn't want
to read the script.

559
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,950
It was crazy, the idea of me
reading the script to him.

560
00:30:58,116 --> 00:31:01,037
But he was dead serious
and I saw this gun.

561
00:31:01,204 --> 00:31:03,498
He put it right to my head.

562
00:31:03,665 --> 00:31:05,334
I thought he means this.

563
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:08,046
This is really real stuff.

564
00:31:08,838 --> 00:31:11,508
My performance
on reading that script

565
00:31:11,675 --> 00:31:13,386
was the best I've ever given.

566
00:31:13,552 --> 00:31:16,765
I probably should've gotten
an Academy Award.

567
00:31:16,932 --> 00:31:18,809
Ladies and gentlemen,
you have no idea

568
00:31:18,976 --> 00:31:21,479
how good it makes me feel
to be here today.

569
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:24,566
It is truly an honour
to risk my life for you,

570
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:26,068
an honour.

571
00:31:26,235 --> 00:31:29,573
Before I jump my motorcycle
over these 19 cars

572
00:31:29,739 --> 00:31:30,782
and I want you to note

573
00:31:30,949 --> 00:31:33,661
there is not a Volkswagen
or a Datsun in the row.

574
00:31:35,163 --> 00:31:38,626
Evel was not happy with it,
I don't believe.

575
00:31:38,792 --> 00:31:41,129
From what I understand
talking to him

576
00:31:41,296 --> 00:31:45,050
I don't believe he was at all happy
with George Hamilton in that.

577
00:31:45,217 --> 00:31:48,388
I don't think Evel appreciated me
climbing into his leathers

578
00:31:48,555 --> 00:31:50,307
and getting on his motorcycle.

579
00:31:50,474 --> 00:31:53,144
But what happened is,
by osmosis,

580
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,230
when he went to see it
in the theatre,

581
00:31:55,397 --> 00:31:57,566
when he came out
he was saying these things.

582
00:31:57,733 --> 00:32:00,194
They were extraordinary words
coming out of his mouth

583
00:32:00,361 --> 00:32:01,905
that John had written for him.

584
00:32:02,072 --> 00:32:03,657
They told the Wright Brothers
to fly was impossible

585
00:32:03,824 --> 00:32:05,242
and they probably
told Neil Armstrong

586
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:06,828
to walk on the moon was impossible.

587
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:09,456
They said that Shephard and Glenn
would never get around the world.

588
00:32:09,623 --> 00:32:11,667
They said that Armstrong
wouldn't step on the moon.

589
00:32:11,834 --> 00:32:15,338
He was using a writer's words.

590
00:32:15,505 --> 00:32:18,259
This is the Evel he's become.

591
00:32:23,223 --> 00:32:25,851
I'm all alone
when I jump those ramps.

592
00:32:26,018 --> 00:32:27,854
There's only two things that
keep the rest of them from doing it,

593
00:32:28,021 --> 00:32:30,107
that's fear and
the big hole in the middle.

594
00:32:30,274 --> 00:32:34,362
As long as I can stand alone
and be the best at what I am doing

595
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:36,573
I am going to continue to do it.

596
00:32:38,534 --> 00:32:41,246
He created a character
named Evel Knievel

597
00:32:41,413 --> 00:32:43,707
and then he tried to live the part.

598
00:32:43,874 --> 00:32:46,711
He never broke character.

599
00:32:46,878 --> 00:32:50,007
He had the Evel Knievel persona.

600
00:32:50,174 --> 00:32:54,471
That's what he presented
to the world.

601
00:32:55,347 --> 00:32:57,099
We don't want guys in Grey hats.

602
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,809
We want black and white.

603
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:00,854
Evel represented that.

604
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:04,734
He definitely thought of himself
as the guy in the white hat -

605
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,027
the good guy.

606
00:33:06,194 --> 00:33:09,656
If I look like I'm rigging up for a
trip to outer space, you are right.

607
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:13,036
Nobody should ever ride a motorcycle
without a helmet.

608
00:33:13,202 --> 00:33:14,996
I never do.

609
00:33:15,163 --> 00:33:16,248
He was...

610
00:33:16,415 --> 00:33:21,546
somebody who was seeking
what many of us do in our own way,

611
00:33:21,713 --> 00:33:23,257
that's recognition.

612
00:33:23,424 --> 00:33:27,053
If you get into his background
you can understand that.

613
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,306
He wanted identity,
he needed that.

614
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,061
He just wanted to be loved.

615
00:33:42,531 --> 00:33:45,618
♪ I wonder how you're feeling.

616
00:33:45,785 --> 00:33:47,537
♪ There's ringing in my ears. ♪

617
00:33:47,704 --> 00:33:48,956
Thank you very much.

618
00:33:49,123 --> 00:33:51,876
It is a pleasure to be back here
in Portland, Oregon.

619
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:54,004
On behalf of my sponsors,

620
00:33:54,171 --> 00:33:57,007
the Mack Truck Company,
the Harley Davidson Motor Company

621
00:33:57,174 --> 00:34:00,261
and the Bucyrus-Erie Crane and
Steam Shovel Company in Milwaukee...

622
00:34:00,428 --> 00:34:03,808
My dad...
he invented the licensing business.

623
00:34:03,974 --> 00:34:05,977
How many people can you think of

624
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:08,730
that had their names on products
before Evel?

625
00:34:08,897 --> 00:34:10,399
There was a few.

626
00:34:10,566 --> 00:34:14,196
But he really elevated the art
of the licensing business.

627
00:34:14,363 --> 00:34:15,906
He had to deal with everyone,

628
00:34:16,073 --> 00:34:17,700
Mac Truck,
Harley Davidson...

629
00:34:17,867 --> 00:34:20,912
But that's not the one I remember.

630
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:23,541
TV: This is Evel Knievel
and his stunt cycle.

631
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:27,170
He's the only rider to do so many
stunts... Mid-air somersaults!

632
00:34:27,337 --> 00:34:30,091
Evel Knievel has become a legend
in his own lifetime.

633
00:34:30,257 --> 00:34:33,762
When Ideal came out
with the Evel Knievel toy

634
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:36,182
the president of Ideal
called me aside and said

635
00:34:36,348 --> 00:34:39,185
"This is going
to be a really big item for us."

636
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:42,147
TV: It's the Evel Knievel rally.

637
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:45,986
For me, there was only one
action figure when I was growing up

638
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:47,529
and that was Evel Knievel.

639
00:34:48,405 --> 00:34:51,075
It was as cool as you
could possibly get at the time.

640
00:34:51,242 --> 00:34:53,745
It came with the motorcycle
you could wind up.

641
00:34:53,912 --> 00:34:55,831
You wind it up and stop...
and it takes off

642
00:34:55,998 --> 00:34:57,750
You wind it up
and keep building this suspense.

643
00:34:57,917 --> 00:34:58,960
You don't know
what is going to happen

644
00:34:59,127 --> 00:35:01,755
but you know its gonna blow up
and it's not going to be pretty.

645
00:35:01,922 --> 00:35:04,092
But you're lucky that this toy is
Evel Knievel because he can take it.

646
00:35:04,258 --> 00:35:05,719
That's awesome!

647
00:35:05,885 --> 00:35:07,888
Wow... Go Evel!

648
00:35:08,055 --> 00:35:09,765
TV: The Evel Knievel stunt cycle

649
00:35:09,932 --> 00:35:13,395
comes with figure, winder,
GT wheelie stand and front flip bar.

650
00:35:13,562 --> 00:35:14,688
New from Ideal.

651
00:35:14,855 --> 00:35:16,983
The toy sold out.

652
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:21,155
I would say
he made more money off of Ideal Toy

653
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:22,448
than he did off any of his jumps.

654
00:35:22,615 --> 00:35:25,493
I was with him one time,
he showed me two royalty cheques.

655
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,914
Both of them were for at that time
half a million dollars each.

656
00:35:29,081 --> 00:35:30,541
Both of them! Two cheques!

657
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:33,337
I told him "Well, you made it.
You're on the pinnacle.

658
00:35:33,503 --> 00:35:34,964
"You said
you were gonna be a millionaire.

659
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,507
"You are a millionaire."

660
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:43,224
It was an amazing time.

661
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:46,728
The money was rolling in
by the millions.

662
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,898
Everywhere he went
he went first class.

663
00:35:49,065 --> 00:35:50,817
Yeah, my dad liked to spend money.

664
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:53,320
All of a sudden,
there's five Ferraris,

665
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:56,365
two Learjets, five other airplanes.

666
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:57,826
He'd get a boat.
He'd need a bigger boat.

667
00:35:57,992 --> 00:36:00,412
How about a yacht?
How about another yacht.

668
00:36:00,579 --> 00:36:02,123
With helicopters on top. (Laughs)

669
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,668
He had Evel Eye I
painted on the side of it.

670
00:36:04,834 --> 00:36:06,670
He's no easy rider.

671
00:36:06,837 --> 00:36:09,382
He's proud of the material things
his money can buy.

672
00:36:09,549 --> 00:36:10,675
His Cadillacs,

673
00:36:10,842 --> 00:36:14,013
his 140,000-dollar
luxury-appointed van...

674
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:17,726
He took me into his office
and opened up a huge safe.

675
00:36:17,892 --> 00:36:21,230
And there was a gold plated
full-sized motorcycle!

676
00:36:21,772 --> 00:36:22,899
But you know what?

677
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:25,902
You could hardly see it
because it was covered in cash

678
00:36:26,069 --> 00:36:28,948
like it had been thrown in there
like confetti.

679
00:36:29,115 --> 00:36:31,827
He built a big beautiful home

680
00:36:31,993 --> 00:36:37,083
on the 18th green
with this huge iron gate

681
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:40,296
with a great big E K
right in the middle of it,

682
00:36:40,462 --> 00:36:41,589
it was the actual handle.

683
00:36:41,756 --> 00:36:45,135
For Butte, Montana,
that was the stuff.

684
00:36:45,302 --> 00:36:47,137
If I'm risking my life for it

685
00:36:47,304 --> 00:36:49,432
I'm gonna spend
every damn dime of it!

686
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,601
Yeah, my dad had an affinity
for clothes.

687
00:36:51,768 --> 00:36:53,270
He liked to dress with flair.

688
00:36:53,437 --> 00:36:56,190
When he would walk into a store
and see a sweater that he liked

689
00:36:56,357 --> 00:36:58,110
he would buy one in twenty colours.

690
00:36:58,276 --> 00:36:59,778
Come on with me,
I'll take you on a tour

691
00:36:59,945 --> 00:37:00,988
of my office and my dressing room

692
00:37:01,155 --> 00:37:03,324
and show you what you can buy
with a few dollars

693
00:37:03,491 --> 00:37:06,245
if you are willing
to jump a motorcycle over 19 cars.

694
00:37:06,495 --> 00:37:07,872
Evel was very flashy.

695
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:10,458
He walked with a cane
with diamonds.

696
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:14,338
His jewellery had diamonds
and he had gold all over.

697
00:37:14,505 --> 00:37:16,132
He always loved Elvis.

698
00:37:16,299 --> 00:37:19,386
They traded the belt buckle
and the key.

699
00:37:19,553 --> 00:37:23,391
My dad was a big fan of Liberace
for being a showman.

700
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:26,228
All the money in the world
can't buy your way into heaven.

701
00:37:26,395 --> 00:37:27,647
It can't buy your way out of hell.

702
00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:29,941
It was made to be spent right here.

703
00:37:30,108 --> 00:37:31,818
I'm gonna have the best clothes,

704
00:37:31,985 --> 00:37:33,529
best boots, best diamonds,

705
00:37:33,696 --> 00:37:35,448
best cars, trucks, motorcycles,

706
00:37:35,615 --> 00:37:37,868
booze and women
on the face of this earth

707
00:37:38,035 --> 00:37:47,462
just as long as I can keep going.

708
00:37:47,463 --> 00:37:49,883
When he came into money
and fame and fortune

709
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:54,597
it's like women became almost
an equal part of his thrust

710
00:37:54,764 --> 00:37:56,099
from day to day.

711
00:37:56,266 --> 00:38:00,688
Part of it was that women were
extraordinarily attracted to him.

712
00:38:00,855 --> 00:38:03,233
I know because
he and I would go out drinking

713
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,319
and, hell, they'd line up.

714
00:38:05,486 --> 00:38:07,196
He'd pick the prettiest one.

715
00:38:07,363 --> 00:38:08,656
He's unbelievable.

716
00:38:08,823 --> 00:38:11,493
He's got more fire in him.
He's unbelievable.

717
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,287
He'd turn the hat trick
half the time

718
00:38:13,454 --> 00:38:17,042
because I'd see him do three a night
for a week while I was there.

719
00:38:17,209 --> 00:38:18,544
Hang on.

720
00:38:19,754 --> 00:38:22,257
Come on, back in the seventies

721
00:38:22,424 --> 00:38:24,968
every woman
wanted somebody like that.

722
00:38:25,135 --> 00:38:26,596
I was always mad

723
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:29,975
because he was maybe cheating
on my mom.

724
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:34,564
♪ I'm the other woman...

725
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:38,027
Linda was Aces. Aces.

726
00:38:38,193 --> 00:38:42,282
She was the nicest woman
that he could've ever married.

727
00:38:42,449 --> 00:38:46,871
She stood by him and a lot of times
he didn't treat her right.

728
00:38:47,038 --> 00:38:49,249
Hey, good looking.
You going swimming again?

729
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:51,543
He didn't hide anything.

730
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:54,297
That's probably
where I get a little upset with him.

731
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,341
He'd come home with
a little lipstick on his collar.

732
00:38:56,508 --> 00:38:58,010
I'd get a little ticked off.

733
00:38:58,177 --> 00:38:59,804
I'd like to take you out
to dinner somewhere

734
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:01,723
in a real nice quiet little spot,

735
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:05,144
get you swacked
and take you home some place.

736
00:39:05,311 --> 00:39:06,354
(Laughter)

737
00:39:10,526 --> 00:39:13,446
I think
"I married this guy!"

738
00:39:13,613 --> 00:39:16,033
I don't know, I just... (Sighs)

739
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:19,954
You just don't leave that man
unless he wants you to. (Laughs)

740
00:39:21,122 --> 00:39:23,250
Let's say I died
and landed in heaven.

741
00:39:23,417 --> 00:39:24,752
I'm there, okay?

742
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:27,922
I'm sitting there in a white robe
on a hard marble slab

743
00:39:28,089 --> 00:39:30,342
next to JFK, Martin Luther King
and some poet,

744
00:39:30,509 --> 00:39:33,471
what the hell would Evel Knievel have
to say to any of those guys?

745
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:35,891
I couldn't carry on an intelligent
conversation with them.

746
00:39:36,058 --> 00:39:38,728
I want to go
to my own kind of heaven...

747
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:42,232
It's got draft beer
that doesn't make you fat,

748
00:39:42,399 --> 00:39:44,068
it's got a lot of beautiful girls
like you running around

749
00:39:44,235 --> 00:39:46,738
and my wife won't get mad
if I go out with them.

750
00:39:46,905 --> 00:39:50,451
He was okay before
he became Evel Knievel and then...

751
00:39:50,618 --> 00:39:53,413
People just can't handle that fame.
Some of them.

752
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:57,459
He's... a small town guy
from a small town.

753
00:39:57,626 --> 00:39:58,836
And he, in...

754
00:39:59,003 --> 00:40:00,755
really in the span of seven years

755
00:40:00,922 --> 00:40:03,342
became one of the most famous
people in the world.

756
00:40:03,509 --> 00:40:06,721
I think that he...

757
00:40:06,888 --> 00:40:08,682
he forgot how to be Bob.

758
00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:11,394
When he became Evel

759
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,897
it's like the world
took him away from us.

760
00:40:14,064 --> 00:40:16,775
If you want to be in this business,
be the best in the world

761
00:40:16,942 --> 00:40:18,736
and wear a red, white and blue
Number One on your back

762
00:40:18,903 --> 00:40:21,573
you have to be man enough
to handle the consequences.

763
00:40:22,366 --> 00:40:24,452
ANNOUNCER: King of the daredevil,
number one,

764
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:26,412
Evel Knievel!

765
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:27,914
Evel was on top of the world

766
00:40:28,081 --> 00:40:30,584
but he was starting
to lose his grip a little.

767
00:40:30,751 --> 00:40:33,546
That thing with the Hell's Angels
didn't help.

768
00:40:35,173 --> 00:40:38,970
Evel was at odds
against the Hell's Angels

769
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:41,139
and the biker image.

770
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:43,809
He used to talk
about the Hell's Angels a lot,

771
00:40:43,976 --> 00:40:45,687
always putting them down.

772
00:40:45,853 --> 00:40:48,690
They're murderers, thieves,
or drug dealers...

773
00:40:48,857 --> 00:40:50,943
I mean these guys are dogs.

774
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,403
They belong in penitentiaries.

775
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:55,616
He must of got through to them.
They got pissed off.

776
00:40:55,783 --> 00:40:59,037
San Francisco was one
of their main areas.

777
00:40:59,704 --> 00:41:02,833
The announcer was the guy
that started the whole thing

778
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,044
when he introduced Knievel
he said

779
00:41:05,211 --> 00:41:06,546
"If Knievel makes this jump tonight

780
00:41:06,713 --> 00:41:09,258
"he's going to set the Hell's Angels
back 100 years."

781
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,093
Wrong thing to say.

782
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:18,603
He barely made that jump,
came back around,

783
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,355
and I noticed...

784
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:23,651
a couple of Hell's Angels
have come out onto the floor.

785
00:41:23,818 --> 00:41:27,823
This Hell's Angel grabbed him -
well, I'm... I'm hoofing it.

786
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,950
The Hell's Angel threw him down.

787
00:41:30,117 --> 00:41:31,619
Just when I got there.

788
00:41:31,786 --> 00:41:33,705
I give this guy a body check

789
00:41:33,872 --> 00:41:36,459
and he folded like...
just went out.

790
00:41:36,626 --> 00:41:38,753
Well, then the war started.

791
00:41:40,672 --> 00:41:43,426
Hell's Angels come
bowling over there.

792
00:41:43,593 --> 00:41:47,306
The people come out of the stands
and started beating on them.

793
00:41:48,682 --> 00:41:52,103
They put two of those Hell's Angels
in the hospital.

794
00:41:57,735 --> 00:42:00,155
After the Cow Palace incident

795
00:42:00,322 --> 00:42:03,159
Evel got a little bit paranoid.

796
00:42:05,203 --> 00:42:07,206
He said "Do you have a gun?"

797
00:42:07,372 --> 00:42:09,125
I said
"Yeah, I got a couple of them."

798
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:10,877
He says "Those Hell's Angels,
you didn't know,

799
00:42:11,044 --> 00:42:12,879
they're gonna walk in here
with a shotgun."

800
00:42:13,046 --> 00:42:15,341
And he says
"I got to be ready for them."

801
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:31,569
The man had crashed numerous times.

802
00:42:31,736 --> 00:42:33,739
Of course, it's gonna add up

803
00:42:33,906 --> 00:42:35,866
mentally and emotionally
in your head.

804
00:42:36,868 --> 00:42:38,370
It has to.

805
00:42:41,373 --> 00:42:43,042
ANNOUNCER:
Watch that right shoulder.

806
00:42:44,586 --> 00:42:46,839
Broken right there,
the right collar bone.

807
00:42:47,005 --> 00:42:48,382
INTERVIEWER: Are you afraid?

808
00:42:48,549 --> 00:42:51,010
If I am,
I'm not gonna tell you about it.

809
00:42:51,177 --> 00:42:52,471
Why?
I've been concerned.

810
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:55,141
I'm Evel Knievel, honey.
I'm not supposed to be afraid.

811
00:42:57,894 --> 00:43:02,316
He was constantly being tormented
with the thought of...

812
00:43:02,483 --> 00:43:05,487
You're not gonna make this one.
You're gonna die at this one.

813
00:43:05,654 --> 00:43:08,824
So he is doing everything he can
through alcohol,

814
00:43:08,991 --> 00:43:10,118
through being flamboyant,

815
00:43:10,285 --> 00:43:14,123
through being... crude or whatever

816
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:16,417
to get these thoughts
out of his head.

817
00:43:16,584 --> 00:43:18,128
But they were eating his lunch.

818
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:19,797
Evel, you're shaking a little bit.

819
00:43:19,963 --> 00:43:23,009
Well, if you did what I did
you'd be shaking, too.

820
00:43:23,676 --> 00:43:25,470
I could see it in his eyes

821
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:29,350
sometimes when he'd come back by to
ask me if he was going fast enough.

822
00:43:29,517 --> 00:43:31,812
I could see the fear in his eyes.

823
00:43:31,979 --> 00:43:34,482
I knew he was scared, but...

824
00:43:34,649 --> 00:43:38,028
he would never say no.

825
00:43:38,195 --> 00:43:39,822
He'd go ahead and do it.

826
00:43:41,324 --> 00:43:42,825
The medicine that he was taking,

827
00:43:42,992 --> 00:43:45,329
the drugs he was taking
for his pain

828
00:43:45,495 --> 00:43:47,039
plus he was drinking

829
00:43:47,206 --> 00:43:51,837
he became just schizo...
I mean, paranoid.

830
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:55,299
He got paranoid
about protecting his stuff,

831
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,636
paranoid about who he let in.

832
00:43:57,803 --> 00:44:00,973
We'd be talking and
almost as if he was schizophrenic

833
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:04,311
he'd flip and become ugly
about things.

834
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:07,773
I had to stand two guys down,
who wanted a piece of him.

835
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,484
They wanted a piece of him

836
00:44:09,651 --> 00:44:13,030
because he was being an asshole,
he was being a jerk.

837
00:44:13,197 --> 00:44:16,534
I'm the guy who's just
trying to keep the peace.

838
00:44:16,701 --> 00:44:22,417
I'm the guy protecting
the troublemaker from the good guys.

839
00:44:22,584 --> 00:44:25,713
You know,
and I thought I can't do this.

840
00:44:28,716 --> 00:44:33,389
It's really interesting
when you are a man like Evel Knievel

841
00:44:33,556 --> 00:44:35,350
and you've created this myth.

842
00:44:35,517 --> 00:44:37,018
Once you're defined

843
00:44:37,185 --> 00:44:39,396
it's hard to live up to it.

844
00:44:40,314 --> 00:44:43,193
He was always reselling
what he had already sold.

845
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,489
How do you get any better than that?
How do you get any bigger?

846
00:44:48,032 --> 00:44:52,371
Throughout his life
he was insatiable.

847
00:44:52,538 --> 00:44:57,544
Even when he was the most famous
daredevil that ever lived

848
00:44:57,711 --> 00:44:59,422
he wasn't satisfied.

849
00:44:59,588 --> 00:45:03,301
He had to make another
half a million dollars on a jump.

850
00:45:03,468 --> 00:45:07,348
He had to find one more woman
prettier than the last.

851
00:45:07,515 --> 00:45:09,267
He couldn't satisfy himself.

852
00:45:09,434 --> 00:45:11,687
He had to do something else.

853
00:45:11,854 --> 00:45:16,026
He had a friend
and they were at the bar, talking.

854
00:45:16,193 --> 00:45:19,155
This fella just made a comment
"What's your next thing?"

855
00:45:19,321 --> 00:45:21,324
I think he said
"The Grand Canyon?"

856
00:45:21,491 --> 00:45:24,495
Of course
that started wheels turning.

857
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:32,338
One of the favourite pictures
of my dad

858
00:45:32,505 --> 00:45:35,008
is he is on the rim
of the Grand Canyon.

859
00:45:35,175 --> 00:45:37,344
There's these two
Navajo Chiefs there.

860
00:45:37,511 --> 00:45:41,725
My dad is pointing at the other side
of the Grand Canyon

861
00:45:41,891 --> 00:45:44,687
and they're just looking at him
like this man is crazy.

862
00:45:44,853 --> 00:45:47,398
My dream was
to jump the Grand Canyon.

863
00:45:47,565 --> 00:45:49,860
The Secretary of Interior
told me that I could.

864
00:45:50,027 --> 00:45:51,612
I took his word for it.

865
00:45:51,779 --> 00:45:53,573
Then he changed his mind.

866
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,410
So I told him to go get hosed

867
00:45:56,577 --> 00:45:58,078
and I bought my own canyon,

868
00:45:58,245 --> 00:46:00,832
Snake River Canyon,
State of Idaho.

869
00:46:00,999 --> 00:46:03,752
The only way
they will get me out of the air

870
00:46:03,919 --> 00:46:06,172
is to shoot me out
with an anti-aircraft gun

871
00:46:06,339 --> 00:46:08,300
because I am gonna go.
Believe me.

872
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:12,054
The jump across the canyon
will be approximately a mile.

873
00:46:12,221 --> 00:46:15,100
It's somewhere between 1000
and 1500 feet to the bottom.

874
00:46:15,267 --> 00:46:16,393
As you can see, Pete,
this motorcycle

875
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,980
is unlike any motorcycle
you've ever seen in this world.

876
00:46:19,146 --> 00:46:22,484
These rockets put out
about 90 pounds of thrust apiece.

877
00:46:22,651 --> 00:46:23,944
Knievel's original concept

878
00:46:24,111 --> 00:46:27,407
was to take a motorcycle,
put a rocket on it.

879
00:46:27,574 --> 00:46:29,076
And that's impossible.

880
00:46:29,242 --> 00:46:34,082
The necessity required
that he make a rocket vehicle.

881
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,335
Our partner was Bob Treaux.

882
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:39,589
He was known
as the father of steam rocketry.

883
00:46:39,756 --> 00:46:44,178
That was our answer for getting
Evel Knievel over the canyon.

884
00:46:45,346 --> 00:46:49,935
Basically, building a hot water tank
and uncorking it and let it go.

885
00:46:50,102 --> 00:46:51,646
This machine is powered by steam.

886
00:46:51,812 --> 00:46:54,816
Steam is the most reliable source
of power we have in the world.

887
00:46:54,983 --> 00:46:57,903
It'll go from zero
to 350 miles per hour

888
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:00,407
from a dead stop
in eight seconds flat.

889
00:47:00,573 --> 00:47:01,700
This super stunt

890
00:47:01,867 --> 00:47:04,161
billed as the death defying
event of the century

891
00:47:04,328 --> 00:47:06,623
will be viewed
by almost two million people

892
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:09,501
most of them watching
on closed circuit movie screens.

893
00:47:09,668 --> 00:47:12,255
I'd like to say to you
what Evel Knievel says

894
00:47:12,422 --> 00:47:14,341
wherever he goes, whatever he signs.

895
00:47:14,508 --> 00:47:16,510
If he were talking to you right now

896
00:47:16,677 --> 00:47:19,556
he'd say
"Hey Jim, happy landings."

897
00:47:20,682 --> 00:47:23,978
When there was an event
of any magnitude during that period

898
00:47:24,145 --> 00:47:26,898
I'd probably get the first call
to do the promotion.

899
00:47:27,065 --> 00:47:29,234
I remember the first time
I saw Evel Knievel

900
00:47:29,401 --> 00:47:33,615
he showed up on Ventura Boulevard
doing wheelies on his motorcycle.

901
00:47:33,782 --> 00:47:35,284
That's when I first met him.

902
00:47:35,451 --> 00:47:38,997
But I really didn't know him until
we did the Snake River Canyon Jump.

903
00:47:39,164 --> 00:47:41,583
I had control
of the publicity and promotion.

904
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:45,046
For a brief moment
of our dull mundane life

905
00:47:45,213 --> 00:47:48,717
here is a man
who vicariously we can live through.

906
00:47:48,884 --> 00:47:50,761
I thought
what he was doing was exciting.

907
00:47:50,928 --> 00:47:53,098
It's never hard
to sell something you believe in.

908
00:47:53,265 --> 00:47:55,309
And I believed in it.

909
00:47:56,852 --> 00:47:59,648
We did a 30-day tour,
which was my idea,

910
00:47:59,814 --> 00:48:04,570
to do press conferences
at, like literally, 90 airports.

911
00:48:05,822 --> 00:48:07,824
ANNOUNCER: When Knievel flies
into town each day

912
00:48:07,991 --> 00:48:09,410
on his two Learjets

913
00:48:09,577 --> 00:48:11,913
his pilot Whacha Macallum
and his co-pilot

914
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:15,250
wear crimson crushed velvet
dinner jackets.

915
00:48:15,417 --> 00:48:17,420
You ought to see our socks
and underwear.

916
00:48:17,587 --> 00:48:20,257
Every day was a... party.

917
00:48:20,424 --> 00:48:23,886
There were close to 2500
press credentials given out.

918
00:48:24,053 --> 00:48:27,182
It was bigger than any Ali fight.
And I did them all.

919
00:48:27,349 --> 00:48:30,853
Bigger
than a presidential entourage.

920
00:48:33,774 --> 00:48:37,403
Don E Branco was in charge
of all the logistics.

921
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:38,905
I was a concert promoter.

922
00:48:39,072 --> 00:48:41,825
I did acts like The Stones,
The Doors, The Who...

923
00:48:42,201 --> 00:48:46,039
Then Evel comes along
with a pay per view closed circuit -

924
00:48:46,206 --> 00:48:48,876
this was the biggest event
of its kind

925
00:48:49,043 --> 00:48:50,378
in the history of entertainment.

926
00:48:51,421 --> 00:48:54,007
The unknowns were magnificent.

927
00:48:54,591 --> 00:48:58,221
This Sunday a daredevil hustler
named Evel Knievel

928
00:48:58,388 --> 00:49:01,767
will try to cross a canyon
in Idaho riding a rocket.

929
00:49:01,934 --> 00:49:04,813
If he makes it
he will be many times a millionaire.

930
00:49:04,979 --> 00:49:07,399
If he doesn't, he'll be dead.

931
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,208
He was a hero of mine
in many ways.

932
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:24,128
I was a little crazy.
He was a whole lot crazy.

933
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:27,174
You just had to dig his courage.

934
00:49:27,341 --> 00:49:30,219
It just didn't seem to me
that courage would be enough.

935
00:49:30,386 --> 00:49:32,639
(Laughs) Chucky...

936
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:36,018
It looks a lot further
than I thought a mile would look.

937
00:49:36,185 --> 00:49:38,313
It was the kind of stunt

938
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,860
where you would actually see
probably a man kill himself.

939
00:49:43,027 --> 00:49:45,489
It was so audacious.
It was so daring.

940
00:49:45,655 --> 00:49:48,576
It was so almost impossible
in many ways

941
00:49:48,743 --> 00:49:50,620
but for his confidence.

942
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:51,997
What about the G-forces?

943
00:49:52,164 --> 00:49:55,626
When you start something that is
going to be going 350 miles per hour

944
00:49:55,793 --> 00:49:57,295
aren't you gonna be knocked out?

945
00:49:57,462 --> 00:49:58,964
Yes, but I'll wake up,

946
00:49:59,131 --> 00:50:01,133
see the other side of the ground
way over there

947
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,385
or wherever the hell I'm at

948
00:50:02,552 --> 00:50:03,970
and I'll pull a rip cord

949
00:50:04,137 --> 00:50:05,555
and open a parachute
beyond that sky sight.

950
00:50:05,722 --> 00:50:08,476
You're going to be unconscious
while you're up in the air?

951
00:50:08,643 --> 00:50:09,811
To 2000 feet,
I probably will be, yes.

952
00:50:09,978 --> 00:50:11,271
You have to regain
your consciousness.

953
00:50:11,438 --> 00:50:13,941
That's right but I can do that.
I'll do it.

954
00:50:14,108 --> 00:50:15,234
Evel had no training.

955
00:50:15,401 --> 00:50:18,029
He had no training
for pulling Gs like a centrifuge

956
00:50:18,196 --> 00:50:19,865
or even in an airplane.

957
00:50:20,032 --> 00:50:22,493
Zero parachute experience.

958
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:26,749
He had a dead-stick kind of thing
that was spring loaded.

959
00:50:26,916 --> 00:50:29,419
If he passed out
and let go of the handle

960
00:50:29,586 --> 00:50:31,046
the parachute would come out.

961
00:50:31,213 --> 00:50:33,007
Go!

962
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:37,304
NEWSREADER: There were three of
the steam-powered skycycles built.

963
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:38,931
The original called the X1

964
00:50:39,097 --> 00:50:42,644
was tested without a pilot
about three weeks ago.

965
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:45,355
It ended up
at the bottom of the canyon.

966
00:50:51,864 --> 00:50:53,949
That was a test shot.
We made some mistakes.

967
00:50:54,116 --> 00:50:55,994
If I'd been in it
I'd've ended up dead.

968
00:50:56,161 --> 00:50:57,913
But I don't think
that's going to happen.

969
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,499
What the press did not know

970
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:04,129
was that the first one
was designed to fail.

971
00:51:04,296 --> 00:51:06,090
We purposely
underpowered the rocket

972
00:51:06,257 --> 00:51:08,509
so it wouldn't make it
to the other side.

973
00:51:08,676 --> 00:51:10,178
He wanted it as a promotional thing.

974
00:51:10,345 --> 00:51:14,726
He wanted it to crash in the water
and let people see that.

975
00:51:14,892 --> 00:51:19,440
Eventually we did convince Evel
to do a real test.

976
00:51:19,607 --> 00:51:22,360
But he'd only do it
if it was done in secret.

977
00:51:22,527 --> 00:51:25,656
So the press wouldn't get
any pictures of it or anything.

978
00:51:28,993 --> 00:51:31,455
We thought it would make it.

979
00:51:31,622 --> 00:51:33,624
But there was a problem
with the parachute.

980
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:35,251
It deployed early.

981
00:51:37,504 --> 00:51:40,675
It also landed right
in the middle of the river.

982
00:51:41,175 --> 00:51:42,552
Knievel was there to see that.

983
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,762
I saw it.

984
00:51:44,471 --> 00:51:47,892
I was wondering at that time
what was going through his mind.

985
00:51:49,394 --> 00:51:51,104
I was thinking to myself

986
00:51:51,271 --> 00:51:53,858
that he maybe was looking
at his mortality

987
00:51:54,025 --> 00:51:58,238
and thinking...
this may not be such a good idea.

988
00:51:59,031 --> 00:52:03,328
However, give him credit,
he was going through with it.

989
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:07,625
At this point
we're batting zero for two.

990
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:11,296
And the world is watching us.
I mean, I felt that.

991
00:52:12,631 --> 00:52:14,676
CROWD: You'll make it!

992
00:52:14,843 --> 00:52:16,511
You will!
You will!

993
00:52:17,638 --> 00:52:20,099
He became more and more surly.

994
00:52:20,725 --> 00:52:22,769
Screeching orders at everybody
that he could.

995
00:52:22,936 --> 00:52:27,275
He belittled little people.
He was just mean.

996
00:52:27,817 --> 00:52:28,944
About a week out

997
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:33,408
is when we started sensing things
not going our way with the press

998
00:52:33,574 --> 00:52:35,577
because the press
is up here living now.

999
00:52:35,744 --> 00:52:37,329
The press started
seeing the real Evel.

1000
00:52:37,496 --> 00:52:40,083
Do one thing.
For me.

1001
00:52:40,249 --> 00:52:43,211
I do not ask for your respect.
I demand it.

1002
00:52:43,378 --> 00:52:46,716
Shelly gathered everybody
around Evel's trailer.

1003
00:52:46,883 --> 00:52:50,179
And said "Why don't you have him
stand up so we can see him?"

1004
00:52:50,345 --> 00:52:53,015
Because there was a big crowd
of people there.

1005
00:52:53,182 --> 00:52:56,979
Evel heard that
and came out and...

1006
00:53:00,608 --> 00:53:02,986
I said "Have a smile on your face."
I don't smile at anybody.

1007
00:53:03,153 --> 00:53:05,656
Alright, get him out.
Get him out! Out!

1008
00:53:05,823 --> 00:53:07,325
Go on get out of here!

1009
00:53:07,492 --> 00:53:09,995
That's when he came down the stairs
with his cane.

1010
00:53:10,162 --> 00:53:13,124
He grabbed my camera.
He's a pretty strong guy.

1011
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:15,293
Grabbed my camera
and started pushing me back

1012
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,713
and whacking me and the camera
with his cane.

1013
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:22,302
Are you going to apologize to
that cameraman for roughing him up?

1014
00:53:22,594 --> 00:53:25,598
I wouldn't apologize.
And if I see the son of a bitch again

1015
00:53:25,765 --> 00:53:27,767
I'll throw him out of here.
How's that?

1016
00:53:27,934 --> 00:53:29,019
As hard as we tried

1017
00:53:29,186 --> 00:53:32,523
a lot of Evel's true temperament
came out to the press.

1018
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:34,943
I think you should apologize.
I want to straighten you out.

1019
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:37,613
Number one,
I was in the skycycle all day.

1020
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:40,283
Number two, you were a guest
in my press area.

1021
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:41,952
Understand that?
And so was he.

1022
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:43,996
Number three,
when I've been up there all day

1023
00:53:44,163 --> 00:53:47,042
and the blood's come out of my legs
and my feet and gone to my head

1024
00:53:47,208 --> 00:53:48,961
and I come down
and want to get some rest

1025
00:53:49,127 --> 00:53:50,838
and get along with you people

1026
00:53:51,005 --> 00:53:53,258
You don't tell me
to come out and stand up and smile.

1027
00:53:53,425 --> 00:53:56,261
If I want to come out
and try and get along with you

1028
00:53:56,428 --> 00:54:00,141
you should at least allow me
to sit down and smile.

1029
00:54:00,308 --> 00:54:03,479
So tell him
I said to kiss my ass!

1030
00:54:03,646 --> 00:54:07,359
There was a point where we were
all sitting around and saying

1031
00:54:07,526 --> 00:54:10,154
"This guy's a jerk.
He's just a jerk!

1032
00:54:10,321 --> 00:54:12,991
"He's a bully,
he's a bore...

1033
00:54:13,158 --> 00:54:14,660
"What are we doing here?"

1034
00:54:14,826 --> 00:54:17,830
The rest of the press can now
thank you because I'm going to leave.

1035
00:54:17,997 --> 00:54:20,041
How's that, boys?

1036
00:54:25,548 --> 00:54:27,801
People started coming in
and it started getting crazy.

1037
00:54:27,968 --> 00:54:30,763
Every biker in the United States
that didn't have a job was there.

1038
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:33,266
You'd have umpteen
different motorcycling groups,

1039
00:54:33,433 --> 00:54:36,395
none of which you'd invite
to your house for dinner.

1040
00:54:36,562 --> 00:54:39,274
They're having a good time.
Everyone gets loose around here.

1041
00:54:39,441 --> 00:54:42,862
You could say
it was like a Woodstock

1042
00:54:43,028 --> 00:54:46,241
but the evil twin of Woodstock.

1043
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:50,580
It was like, not a happy... flower
children sitting around in the rain.

1044
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:53,124
Those guys were...
they were really rough.

1045
00:54:53,291 --> 00:54:55,502
Wackos with tattoos
all over their bodies

1046
00:54:55,669 --> 00:54:58,172
drinking beer
and screwing in public

1047
00:54:58,339 --> 00:54:59,716
and all kinds of...

1048
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:01,343
It was bedlam.

1049
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:06,433
Roach clips! Reefers!
Hash pipes!

1050
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,352
Come get them while they're hot!

1051
00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:11,856
They had a marching band from
Butte High School that was there.

1052
00:55:12,023 --> 00:55:13,358
It was...

1053
00:55:13,525 --> 00:55:17,113
not a place for a B High
marching band to be that day.

1054
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,406
I'd have to say.

1055
00:55:18,573 --> 00:55:21,744
Right when we pulled in
there was a man and woman naked

1056
00:55:21,911 --> 00:55:25,624
having sex right there
under a tree.

1057
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:27,125
I saw all the people

1058
00:55:27,292 --> 00:55:30,630
that were drinking,
smoking pot and...

1059
00:55:30,797 --> 00:55:33,133
They were pretty wild.

1060
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,343
BAND MUSIC

1061
00:55:37,221 --> 00:55:39,182
We fired up the band.

1062
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:42,603
It's like the whole place arose.

1063
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:44,522
Oh they... the crowd went wild.

1064
00:55:44,689 --> 00:55:45,732
Yeah, absolutely.

1065
00:55:45,899 --> 00:55:48,694
They were totally prepared
for a celebration.

1066
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:52,240
The crowd just started mingling

1067
00:55:52,407 --> 00:55:55,494
and wanted to play our instruments.

1068
00:55:55,661 --> 00:55:57,372
They tugged and pulled.

1069
00:55:57,539 --> 00:55:59,082
Next thing we know
we're separated

1070
00:55:59,249 --> 00:56:02,712
a good 100 yards away
from the rest of the band.

1071
00:56:02,879 --> 00:56:04,631
So we were basically
fighting for our lives

1072
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:05,966
as far as I was concerned.

1073
00:56:06,133 --> 00:56:10,513
At that point, they just
stuffed my tuba full of everything,

1074
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:14,018
beer bottles, popcorn,
peanuts, rocks...

1075
00:56:14,184 --> 00:56:15,645
I pulled a bra out of there...

1076
00:56:15,811 --> 00:56:18,523
I never played a note.

1077
00:56:20,818 --> 00:56:23,446
We also had with us
the drill team.

1078
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:26,074
The drill team,
their name was the Purple Bees.

1079
00:56:26,241 --> 00:56:29,704
A good friend of mine,
they tore her dress right off.

1080
00:56:30,497 --> 00:56:31,915
They totally tore her dress off.

1081
00:56:33,459 --> 00:56:35,962
I guess we all thought of this
as something different

1082
00:56:36,129 --> 00:56:37,714
than it was really gonna be.

1083
00:56:40,426 --> 00:56:42,512
The crowd were given beer.

1084
00:56:42,678 --> 00:56:47,685
When the beer was closed up,
that's when it got kind of rowdy.

1085
00:56:47,852 --> 00:56:49,604
They actually rolled
the beer trucks over,

1086
00:56:49,771 --> 00:56:52,107
the semis over on their side,

1087
00:56:52,274 --> 00:56:53,901
shot the locks off

1088
00:56:54,068 --> 00:56:56,738
and everyone was walking through
the camps with cases of beer.

1089
00:56:56,905 --> 00:56:58,907
Next thing you know
they took the outhouses.

1090
00:56:59,074 --> 00:57:01,202
They took them down,
started dumping them over

1091
00:57:01,369 --> 00:57:02,745
and they lit them on fire.

1092
00:57:02,912 --> 00:57:06,667
The place was absolutely
out of control at that point.

1093
00:57:07,293 --> 00:57:11,256
Things got as bad as it could
get bad without somebody dying.

1094
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:14,427
That's as simple as that.
Just as bad as it could be.

1095
00:57:14,594 --> 00:57:17,556
I can hear out in the darkness...

1096
00:57:17,722 --> 00:57:21,060
I can hear the girls being raped.
I can hear fights going on.

1097
00:57:21,227 --> 00:57:23,480
I can hear gunshots going off.

1098
00:57:23,647 --> 00:57:25,315
There was nothing I could do.

1099
00:57:25,482 --> 00:57:26,817
Finally, I reach the point

1100
00:57:26,984 --> 00:57:29,153
where I said "I'm gonna
call the National Guard in."

1101
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,865
I called them up
and he says "Don, I'm sorry.

1102
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:34,577
"Our men are split up. I can't
come out there and help you.

1103
00:57:34,744 --> 00:57:36,121
"You're on your own, son."

1104
00:57:36,287 --> 00:57:39,625
I hung up that phone
and I felt like crying.

1105
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:42,962
ANNOUNCER: There were more
than 33,000 paid admissions.

1106
00:57:43,129 --> 00:57:44,881
As you can see
they needed control.

1107
00:57:45,048 --> 00:57:47,552
They were perilously close
to the edge of the canyon,

1108
00:57:47,718 --> 00:57:49,429
some 600 feet straight down.

1109
00:57:49,596 --> 00:57:52,474
What I was concerned about is
that there was this canyon.

1110
00:57:52,641 --> 00:57:54,852
This killer canyon in front of you

1111
00:57:55,019 --> 00:57:57,773
and they put up
a standard cyclone fence.

1112
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,984
I mean, You'd just push it
and it'd fall over.

1113
00:58:00,151 --> 00:58:01,444
I thought to myself

1114
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:04,323
"Everybody's gonna rush
to that edge of the canyon

1115
00:58:04,489 --> 00:58:06,200
"to see what happens."

1116
00:58:06,367 --> 00:58:08,119
You're gonna have people
pushing from behind.

1117
00:58:08,286 --> 00:58:09,996
Like the lemmings in the sea

1118
00:58:10,163 --> 00:58:12,166
they're gonna go
right over the edge.

1119
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:15,003
(Laughs) I thought
it was pretty ironic

1120
00:58:15,169 --> 00:58:17,839
that Donny solved
the security problem.

1121
00:58:18,006 --> 00:58:20,510
He went down to where
the Hell's Angels were camped

1122
00:58:20,676 --> 00:58:23,638
and hired them to come up
and provide security for us.

1123
00:58:23,805 --> 00:58:25,641
I went there
and explained what I'll do.

1124
00:58:25,808 --> 00:58:27,810
"I've got 1000 dollars in cash.

1125
00:58:27,977 --> 00:58:29,479
"I want you to guard the fence

1126
00:58:29,646 --> 00:58:31,899
"and keep people
on that side of the fence."

1127
00:58:32,066 --> 00:58:34,444
The guys said
"Are you bull-shitting me?"

1128
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:37,114
I said "Am I gonna bull-shit
with you guys here?"

1129
00:58:37,281 --> 00:58:39,283
"Okay, you got a deal, mister."
(Laughs)

1130
00:58:43,205 --> 00:58:46,417
"OH SAY CAN YOU SEE" PLAYS

1131
00:58:50,088 --> 00:58:51,799
On the morning of the jump

1132
00:58:51,966 --> 00:58:54,510
I looked at him

1133
00:58:54,677 --> 00:59:00,351
and I saw a very pensive,
very reflective, very quiet man.

1134
00:59:00,518 --> 00:59:02,729
He didn't look comfortable.

1135
00:59:02,896 --> 00:59:05,816
I don't know
why he would look comfortable

1136
00:59:05,983 --> 00:59:09,863
climbing into a tin can
to fly over a canyon.

1137
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:12,450
ANNOUNCER: There is Bob Treaux
himself, the chief engineer,

1138
00:59:12,617 --> 00:59:13,659
testing the wind.

1139
00:59:13,826 --> 00:59:17,498
The 50-mile-an-hour wind
was not the right direction.

1140
00:59:17,665 --> 00:59:20,668
We recommended to Knievel
that he delay the launch.

1141
00:59:20,835 --> 00:59:23,589
I says "Bob, I don't think
you ought to do it."

1142
00:59:23,755 --> 00:59:25,132
I think this is crazy.

1143
00:59:25,299 --> 00:59:27,302
I think this thing
isn't gonna make it.

1144
00:59:27,468 --> 00:59:30,305
He says "I can't back out now.
Too much has been said.

1145
00:59:30,472 --> 00:59:32,683
"They'd call me a coward"
he says. "I'm not gonna do that.

1146
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:34,185
"I'm going and that's it."

1147
00:59:34,352 --> 00:59:37,022
I've got a team behind me
with Mr. Treuax.

1148
00:59:37,189 --> 00:59:40,193
And all the boys
that are 100 percent and...

1149
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,695
I think we'll do it.

1150
00:59:41,862 --> 00:59:44,114
I wish
the wind wasn't blowing so hard

1151
00:59:44,281 --> 00:59:45,908
but I think we'll do it.

1152
00:59:46,784 --> 00:59:48,995
There was no braggadocio.

1153
00:59:49,162 --> 00:59:51,707
There was no bravado.

1154
00:59:51,874 --> 00:59:54,544
As the time counted off

1155
00:59:54,711 --> 00:59:57,673
he said to his family
"Lets pray."

1156
00:59:59,968 --> 01:00:03,430
Yeah, I remember when my dad
brought me in the trailer

1157
01:00:06,351 --> 01:00:08,478
and the truck...
(Sniffs)

1158
01:00:08,645 --> 01:00:11,399
The whole family...

1159
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:14,861
and he hugged me
and says "I love you."

1160
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:17,072
He didn't know
what was gonna happen.

1161
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:20,034
He was like "God, take care of me."

1162
01:00:20,201 --> 01:00:22,120
Linda and the children
were crying.

1163
01:00:24,081 --> 01:00:25,750
Specially, the little girl.

1164
01:00:27,502 --> 01:00:31,340
Yeah, that was
a very sobering moment.

1165
01:00:31,507 --> 01:00:32,842
Suddenly, I realized...

1166
01:00:33,551 --> 01:00:36,805
"Have I had a hand
in getting a man killed?"

1167
01:00:38,808 --> 01:00:40,602
ANNOUNCER: There he goes up the ramp

1168
01:00:40,769 --> 01:00:45,191
towards the launch site
and towards the vehicle.

1169
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:48,821
He's being introduced
to the crowd now.

1170
01:00:49,363 --> 01:00:52,742
I've never been afraid in my life
of dying.

1171
01:00:52,909 --> 01:00:57,164
I think a man was put on this earth
to live.

1172
01:00:57,331 --> 01:00:59,751
Not just to exist.

1173
01:00:59,918 --> 01:01:02,421
Today is the proudest day
of my life.

1174
01:01:02,588 --> 01:01:04,340
I'm living a dream

1175
01:01:04,507 --> 01:01:07,427
they thought could never be done
but it'll be done.

1176
01:01:07,594 --> 01:01:10,973
WHISTLES AND CLAPPING

1177
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:13,894
And then...
instead of a roar

1178
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:18,358
a silence, an eerie silence
fell over the crowd

1179
01:01:18,524 --> 01:01:22,112
because this guy truly
might be going to his death.

1180
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:26,201
HEROIC MUSIC

1181
01:01:33,835 --> 01:01:38,299
Evel got out of the crane
and into the skycycle.

1182
01:01:38,466 --> 01:01:40,928
The whole time
patriotic music is being played

1183
01:01:41,094 --> 01:01:44,849
and at that time
even I got emotional a bit.

1184
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:49,230
Fecundo and I strapped him in,

1185
01:01:49,396 --> 01:01:52,609
and got a couple of pictures
of him in the cockpit.

1186
01:01:52,776 --> 01:01:55,529
He looked a lot different than
he did when we started this project.

1187
01:01:55,696 --> 01:01:58,283
His hair was Grey
and he was real serious.

1188
01:01:59,242 --> 01:02:00,827
We had a big clock.

1189
01:02:01,537 --> 01:02:03,623
Ten seconds...
nine seconds...

1190
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:04,833
eight, seven...

1191
01:02:04,999 --> 01:02:07,878
you look at the audience,
no one is even breathing.

1192
01:02:08,045 --> 01:02:10,047
Five...
four...

1193
01:02:10,214 --> 01:02:12,175
ANNOUNCER: Three, two, one...

1194
01:02:18,558 --> 01:02:20,561
Immediately, something failed.

1195
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:22,563
It fizzled.

1196
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:24,774
It went down like a bullet.

1197
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:26,985
ANNOUNCER: There's fire.
The main shute's out.

1198
01:02:27,152 --> 01:02:28,487
There she goes.

1199
01:02:28,654 --> 01:02:30,198
It's going to crash.

1200
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,162
Just missed the rocks,
thank god!

1201
01:02:35,329 --> 01:02:37,165
David, I can't see anything.

1202
01:02:37,332 --> 01:02:39,835
I had my camera.
I was taking click click click...

1203
01:02:40,002 --> 01:02:41,712
Chhhhhh...
right into the canyon.

1204
01:02:41,879 --> 01:02:47,136
I turn around and the first fence
just goes flat, shwoop!

1205
01:02:47,302 --> 01:02:49,889
It was a stampede.
That's exactly what it was.

1206
01:02:50,056 --> 01:02:52,559
I saw bikers pluck people
out of the sky.

1207
01:02:52,726 --> 01:02:54,603
It was right out of a movie.

1208
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:56,606
ANNOUNCER: Robert Craig Knievel
has appeared

1209
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,735
to have landed in the Snake River.

1210
01:02:59,902 --> 01:03:02,280
Evel definitely tried to get out
but he couldn't.

1211
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:04,366
David, I am very scared.

1212
01:03:04,532 --> 01:03:06,034
I thought he was gone.

1213
01:03:06,201 --> 01:03:08,704
"They're not gonna get to him
in time. He's gonna drown."

1214
01:03:11,666 --> 01:03:13,919
There was people running up
looking over the edge.

1215
01:03:14,086 --> 01:03:17,716
Linda was scared
and the boys were scared.

1216
01:03:17,882 --> 01:03:19,384
I thought my dad was dead.

1217
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:21,178
I was screaming, crying.

1218
01:03:22,013 --> 01:03:23,723
I got into my helicopter,

1219
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:25,308
got over the canyon,

1220
01:03:25,475 --> 01:03:26,602
and there...

1221
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:29,856
from the muddy banks
on the side of the river...

1222
01:03:31,525 --> 01:03:32,985
was Evel waving.

1223
01:03:33,152 --> 01:03:34,653
I said this:

1224
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:37,657
"Thank god,
that son of a bitch is alive."

1225
01:03:37,866 --> 01:03:40,160
ANNOUNCER: Evel Knievel
is standing in the boat and waving.

1226
01:03:40,327 --> 01:03:42,163
He is alive and well.

1227
01:03:43,957 --> 01:03:46,293
I know the well-wishers
are anxious...

1228
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:48,212
Walking towards that helicopter...

1229
01:03:48,379 --> 01:03:52,175
He's on the ground now
and he's being mobbed by the crowd.

1230
01:03:53,385 --> 01:03:55,388
What happened, Evel?
I don't know what happened.

1231
01:03:55,555 --> 01:03:57,641
It's just... I think...
Evel?

1232
01:03:57,808 --> 01:03:59,560
I don't know.
I just can't say.

1233
01:03:59,727 --> 01:04:02,438
I'll have to let Bob
and the fellas examine it.

1234
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:04,065
Bob, what happened?

1235
01:04:04,232 --> 01:04:09,280
Well, this right here is the cover
to the parachute canister.

1236
01:04:09,447 --> 01:04:12,826
It obviously came loose
much too soon right on the pad.

1237
01:04:12,993 --> 01:04:14,370
What happened was that...

1238
01:04:14,537 --> 01:04:17,874
it went up and I knew immediately
the chute had been deployed.

1239
01:04:18,041 --> 01:04:21,921
It came off because of a mechanical
problem with the design.

1240
01:04:22,088 --> 01:04:23,590
You didn't do a damn thing.

1241
01:04:23,757 --> 01:04:25,425
The can is still on the thing.

1242
01:04:25,592 --> 01:04:27,720
It blew up right there
on the launch.

1243
01:04:27,887 --> 01:04:30,140
Blew up by accident?
Yeah, it was our fault.

1244
01:04:30,307 --> 01:04:32,935
That's what has been determined?
Its not your fault.

1245
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:36,147
It's the canister's fault.
We should have run one more test.

1246
01:04:36,856 --> 01:04:40,528
It was clear to me, or to us
that it was a mechanical failure.

1247
01:04:40,695 --> 01:04:42,197
But there was another story

1248
01:04:42,363 --> 01:04:44,366
being banded about
back at the press tent

1249
01:04:44,533 --> 01:04:47,912
that perhaps, Evel had released
the chute early.

1250
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:50,999
I told people
that that's what happened.

1251
01:04:51,542 --> 01:04:54,045
When I went to the press tent
after the jump

1252
01:04:54,212 --> 01:04:56,715
the press was asking for me
to make a statement.

1253
01:04:56,882 --> 01:05:00,720
I told the press
that his hand came off of the bar.

1254
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:05,434
I really liked the rocket crew.
They were a bunch of nice guys.

1255
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:09,230
I knew that the MO...
of how he treated people.

1256
01:05:09,397 --> 01:05:10,983
Nothing was ever his fault.

1257
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:14,070
I told people
that that's what happened.

1258
01:05:14,237 --> 01:05:18,534
If by chance that took a little bit
of pressure off of the rocket team

1259
01:05:18,701 --> 01:05:20,453
so be it.

1260
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:23,623
So it got out
that it was Evel's fault.

1261
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:25,417
But the nagging question remains...

1262
01:05:25,584 --> 01:05:28,505
Was this the legitimate attempt
of a brave man

1263
01:05:28,671 --> 01:05:31,300
or was it
the great rip-off of 1974?

1264
01:05:31,467 --> 01:05:35,347
Then, the press tore him up.

1265
01:05:35,513 --> 01:05:37,850
Cause they think
that he, along with me,

1266
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:39,352
had perpetrated a fraud.

1267
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:41,020
Hero or hustler?

1268
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:44,900
Or for Americans,
are those the same thing?

1269
01:05:47,487 --> 01:05:50,032
It was Evel Knievel
against the Snake River Canyon

1270
01:05:50,198 --> 01:05:53,536
and the canyon
was the sentimental favourite.

1271
01:05:54,078 --> 01:05:57,416
Evel would have liked his jump
to be huge front page news.

1272
01:05:57,583 --> 01:06:01,337
But it was overwhelmingly squashed
by the big news of the day,

1273
01:06:01,504 --> 01:06:05,843
which was the pardon of Nixon
by President Ford.

1274
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:09,973
That was a major transition
in the country.

1275
01:06:10,474 --> 01:06:11,517
Maybe...

1276
01:06:11,684 --> 01:06:13,937
maybe he had outlived his novelty

1277
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:17,358
because I think people might of
gotten tired of listening to it.

1278
01:06:17,524 --> 01:06:22,364
And that's when
he came back to Butte.

1279
01:06:22,531 --> 01:06:25,368
He was... I don't know
if he was depressed or what.

1280
01:06:25,534 --> 01:06:27,996
(Sighs) He just...

1281
01:06:29,915 --> 01:06:32,418
I thought sure
he's just give up after that

1282
01:06:32,585 --> 01:06:35,005
and say "Well, I'm done."

1283
01:06:35,172 --> 01:06:38,843
MUSIC AND WHISTLING

1284
01:06:41,304 --> 01:06:45,393
♪ England swings
like a pendulum do... ♪

1285
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:48,063
He had never been to England before.

1286
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:51,567
He thought
"A new crowd, a new group,

1287
01:06:51,734 --> 01:06:54,946
"I can snow them a little more
than I can the Americans.

1288
01:06:55,113 --> 01:06:57,825
Yeah, they hadn't heard
the Teddy Roosevelt speech...

1289
01:06:57,992 --> 01:07:00,537
"Be good to your parents,
wear a helmet..."

1290
01:07:05,293 --> 01:07:08,046
ANNOUNCER: Evel Knievel is alive,
well, and back in action

1291
01:07:08,213 --> 01:07:11,133
in the famed old Wembley Stadium
in London, England

1292
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:15,013
for a jump that will be made
over thirteen London buses.

1293
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:16,515
When he arrived in London

1294
01:07:16,682 --> 01:07:20,937
he had only sold 3,000 seats
for a 100,000 seat stadium

1295
01:07:21,104 --> 01:07:22,564
and he was in trouble.

1296
01:07:22,731 --> 01:07:24,483
There was some press there
to meet him.

1297
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:27,404
He looks at the press
and what did he do?

1298
01:07:27,571 --> 01:07:29,573
"I'm so glad to be here in England

1299
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:32,493
"where we came
and won the war for you."

1300
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:36,665
("English" accent) Oh?
And they start writing.

1301
01:07:36,832 --> 01:07:41,046
He knew his job, which was
to get people in Wembley Stadium.

1302
01:07:41,213 --> 01:07:44,509
We drove around London
just making friends.

1303
01:07:44,675 --> 01:07:47,387
How you doing? What's your name?
Stephen...

1304
01:07:47,554 --> 01:07:50,766
ANNOUNCER: So the Yankee pied piper
collected the young and the old

1305
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:53,436
and led them all
to Wembley Stadium.

1306
01:07:56,690 --> 01:08:00,195
80,000 people showed up
to watch the man do it.

1307
01:08:01,655 --> 01:08:04,826
So we walked
into the arena of Wembley,

1308
01:08:04,993 --> 01:08:07,871
where the buses were lined up.

1309
01:08:08,038 --> 01:08:10,166
He said "I can't do that."

1310
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:12,252
"What do you mean,
you can't do that?"

1311
01:08:12,419 --> 01:08:13,628
I said
"Pull a few buses out of there.

1312
01:08:13,795 --> 01:08:15,422
"Come on.
It won't hurt a thing to do that."

1313
01:08:15,589 --> 01:08:17,174
I go over and grab our producer.

1314
01:08:17,341 --> 01:08:20,929
I said
"Doug, Evel says he can't do that."

1315
01:08:21,096 --> 01:08:25,518
He really didn't think
he was going to make it.

1316
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:30,191
I went over to talk to Evel,
talk him out of it.

1317
01:08:30,358 --> 01:08:33,236
He was in a trailer
and I knocked on the door.

1318
01:08:33,403 --> 01:08:37,116
He said "Ah no, I'll give it a go.
I'll give it a go."

1319
01:08:37,283 --> 01:08:39,119
He's always
"I'll give it a go."

1320
01:08:40,162 --> 01:08:42,540
He was right.
He couldn't make it.

1321
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:48,213
ANNOUNCER: Here's Evel Knievel!

1322
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:51,718
Evel, one has to wonder
after Snake River

1323
01:08:51,885 --> 01:08:53,679
one has to wonder why you continue?

1324
01:08:53,845 --> 01:08:55,431
Well...

1325
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:58,393
I... sometimes think
that maybe I should quit

1326
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,854
but you always want
to keep going and...

1327
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:04,233
I'm proud of that red, white and blue
Number One I wear on my shoulder.

1328
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,986
I want to keep it on.
I'm glad you're here today.

1329
01:09:06,153 --> 01:09:07,780
I've never had an accident
while you're around.

1330
01:09:07,946 --> 01:09:09,782
Good luck.
Thank you, Frank.

1331
01:09:11,534 --> 01:09:12,869
Well, he told me earlier

1332
01:09:13,036 --> 01:09:16,958
outside of the jump at Caesar's
Palace where he was severely injured

1333
01:09:17,125 --> 01:09:21,046
this will probably be the most
difficult jump he has ever made.

1334
01:09:21,881 --> 01:09:27,596
Hurt himself in Indio in 1967,
Caesar's Palace...

1335
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:29,515
Will he go?
And he will go.

1336
01:09:32,352 --> 01:09:35,898
SOUND SLOWS DOWN

1337
01:09:46,995 --> 01:09:49,749
It was almost eerie though.

1338
01:09:50,416 --> 01:09:52,628
The motorcycle was ghostly.

1339
01:09:52,794 --> 01:09:55,423
It was tumbling after him.

1340
01:09:57,008 --> 01:09:59,887
Then, eventually, it landed on him.

1341
01:10:08,522 --> 01:10:10,191
He's down and he is hurt.

1342
01:10:10,358 --> 01:10:11,818
Oh my god!

1343
01:10:16,282 --> 01:10:18,034
The man you see leaning over him

1344
01:10:18,201 --> 01:10:20,287
that is John Hood,
his chief mechanic.

1345
01:10:20,454 --> 01:10:23,082
I knew
he's got to be hurt on this one.

1346
01:10:23,249 --> 01:10:25,878
I kneeled down
and said "Are you okay?"

1347
01:10:26,044 --> 01:10:28,798
I got his helmet off
and he said "Help me up."

1348
01:10:28,965 --> 01:10:31,009
And he wanted the microphone.

1349
01:10:31,176 --> 01:10:33,387
I want to stand up.
Help me up.

1350
01:10:33,554 --> 01:10:35,598
He wants to talk.
He's gonna talk.

1351
01:10:41,647 --> 01:10:44,192
Ladies and gentlemen...

1352
01:10:44,359 --> 01:10:47,989
of this wonderful country...

1353
01:10:48,489 --> 01:10:51,743
I've got to tell you

1354
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:57,834
that you are the last people
in the world

1355
01:10:58,001 --> 01:10:59,712
who will ever see me jump

1356
01:10:59,879 --> 01:11:03,133
because I will never, ever,
ever jump again. I'm through.

1357
01:11:13,062 --> 01:11:16,691
That crash was one of the worst
as far as injuries would go.

1358
01:11:17,776 --> 01:11:21,781
He broke his hand, back...
re-broke his pelvis.

1359
01:11:23,491 --> 01:11:26,871
After Wembley, I went home to edit.
Phone rang.

1360
01:11:27,038 --> 01:11:28,331
"Hello Doug, Evel..."

1361
01:11:28,498 --> 01:11:30,792
He's calling me
from his hospital room in London.

1362
01:11:30,959 --> 01:11:33,087
"Doug, you can't use that quote."

1363
01:11:33,254 --> 01:11:34,797
"What do you mean, Evel?"

1364
01:11:34,964 --> 01:11:36,299
"You can't use that quote.

1365
01:11:36,466 --> 01:11:38,427
"Where I said
I wouldn't jump again."

1366
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:40,012
I said "Oh, why?"

1367
01:11:40,179 --> 01:11:41,556
"Because I may jump again!"

1368
01:11:41,723 --> 01:11:43,600
When the jump was over
in London

1369
01:11:43,767 --> 01:11:45,769
I said
that I would never jump again.

1370
01:11:47,021 --> 01:11:49,107
That was the pain in my body

1371
01:11:49,274 --> 01:11:52,945
overpowering the brains
I'm supposed to have in my head.

1372
01:11:53,112 --> 01:11:55,031
I will jump again.

1373
01:11:55,198 --> 01:11:57,534
But 13 is an unlucky number.

1374
01:11:57,701 --> 01:12:00,747
This time
I'm gonna jump 14 buses.

1375
01:12:00,913 --> 01:12:04,209
Somehow he gets the idea
"I'm not gonna go out with a crash.

1376
01:12:04,376 --> 01:12:06,379
"I'm gonna go back
to the United States

1377
01:12:06,545 --> 01:12:08,882
"and I'm gonna jump 14 buses."

1378
01:12:09,049 --> 01:12:10,550
That's just who he was.

1379
01:12:10,717 --> 01:12:13,679
You can't do it, say you're the best
in the world and fall off

1380
01:12:13,846 --> 01:12:15,598
and get up and say
"I quit."

1381
01:12:15,765 --> 01:12:17,810
Not if you're an Evel Knievel,
you can't.

1382
01:12:17,976 --> 01:12:20,563
TV: The Kings Island Family
entertainment centre

1383
01:12:20,730 --> 01:12:22,983
located just outside
of Cincinnati, Ohio,

1384
01:12:23,150 --> 01:12:24,652
is jam-packed with people,

1385
01:12:24,818 --> 01:12:28,531
who have come to watch Evel Knievel
out of retirement.

1386
01:12:28,698 --> 01:12:31,744
Here he comes right now.
Robert Craig Knievel.

1387
01:12:32,578 --> 01:12:35,123
A lot was riding on this jump.

1388
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:36,959
It was a different Evel.

1389
01:12:37,125 --> 01:12:39,295
I mean
he actually did practice jumps.

1390
01:12:40,338 --> 01:12:41,464
I'm gonna go, Frank.

1391
01:12:41,631 --> 01:12:44,385
There's no wind gonna stop me,
not even a hurricane.

1392
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:48,139
It was a very gutsy jump.

1393
01:12:48,306 --> 01:12:51,602
The doctors told him
"Don't ever do that again."

1394
01:12:51,769 --> 01:12:56,567
One little slip, wrong thing
and he'd probably be paralysed.

1395
01:13:04,743 --> 01:13:06,204
ANNOUNCER: Total concentration now...

1396
01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:10,501
getting the bike off the approach
ramp and onto the landing ramp...

1397
01:13:18,302 --> 01:13:20,638
...and he's not hesitating,
he'll go...

1398
01:13:41,122 --> 01:13:43,667
Busted the motorcycle
right in half, Frank.

1399
01:13:43,834 --> 01:13:46,087
Boy, it did come apart,
didn't it?

1400
01:13:46,254 --> 01:13:48,632
It wasn't an idea of mine.
I know.

1401
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:51,844
Thank you.

1402
01:13:53,471 --> 01:13:56,600
This motorcycle
is the finest machine in the world

1403
01:13:56,767 --> 01:13:57,810
as far as I am concerned.

1404
01:13:57,977 --> 01:14:00,230
It broke in half
but it held me up.

1405
01:14:00,397 --> 01:14:02,649
All I can say is
thanks to Number One,

1406
01:14:02,816 --> 01:14:03,943
thanks to Harley Davidson

1407
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:06,821
you've been so good to me
through the years.

1408
01:14:07,614 --> 01:14:10,701
I would like to tell all of you
something though.

1409
01:14:10,868 --> 01:14:12,871
As far as I am concerned

1410
01:14:13,037 --> 01:14:15,290
I have jumped far enough.

1411
01:14:15,457 --> 01:14:18,503
Today I am going to walk away
from here with you.

1412
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:21,632
I feel like being a professional,
that's what I'm gonna do.

1413
01:14:23,676 --> 01:14:27,055
Kings Island was the longest jump
of his career.

1414
01:14:27,222 --> 01:14:29,725
It was the biggest television
audience he ever had.

1415
01:14:29,892 --> 01:14:35,607
It was the highest rated episode
of Wide World of Sports ever.

1416
01:14:35,774 --> 01:14:40,280
He did some small jumps after that
but he never went that big again.

1417
01:14:40,447 --> 01:14:42,992
Kings Island was...

1418
01:14:43,159 --> 01:14:46,371
the gunfighter
putting away his pistols.

1419
01:14:56,759 --> 01:14:59,262
If you're on a bike
you'd do stupid shit.

1420
01:14:59,930 --> 01:15:03,976
But you'd do stupid shit
in the name of Evel Knievel.

1421
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:08,399
I thought that's why you had a bike.

1422
01:15:08,565 --> 01:15:10,234
I didn't know
you just rode bikes around.

1423
01:15:10,401 --> 01:15:12,153
I thought
the whole purpose of bikes

1424
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,572
were to hit things
and fly off of them.

1425
01:15:13,739 --> 01:15:14,782
We'd line up the neighbour kids

1426
01:15:14,948 --> 01:15:16,701
and see who could jump
more neighbours

1427
01:15:16,867 --> 01:15:19,329
without landing on them
and things like that.

1428
01:15:19,496 --> 01:15:21,582
But we just dreamed
of having a motor between our legs.

1429
01:15:21,749 --> 01:15:23,709
I loved just going down steps.

1430
01:15:23,876 --> 01:15:25,211
I crashed all the time.

1431
01:15:25,378 --> 01:15:28,173
Like, yeah, you're gonna be like
Evel Knievel, but not as good.

1432
01:15:31,052 --> 01:15:34,515
There's no way that a youngster
is not going to want

1433
01:15:34,681 --> 01:15:36,851
to try to do what his hero does.

1434
01:15:37,018 --> 01:15:38,603
I don't think
there is anything wrong

1435
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:40,355
with a kid
wanting to be an Evel Knievel

1436
01:15:40,522 --> 01:15:42,233
any more than
wanting to be an OJ Simpson

1437
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,862
or Frank Gifford,
any kind of a professional athlete.

1438
01:15:46,029 --> 01:15:48,198
Do you view him as a hero?
Yeah.

1439
01:15:48,365 --> 01:15:50,410
Yeah, he's one
of the greatest heroes.

1440
01:15:50,576 --> 01:15:53,080
He was a hero to so many kids.

1441
01:15:53,246 --> 01:15:56,375
But his own son was his biggest fan.

1442
01:15:58,002 --> 01:16:00,255
This is Robbie.
Look at the little guy go.

1443
01:16:01,006 --> 01:16:03,801
Wouldn't you know it would be
the young one that would steal it.

1444
01:16:03,968 --> 01:16:06,388
He's the one that has got
to have the longest wheelie.

1445
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:09,892
He totally saw me in him.

1446
01:16:10,059 --> 01:16:11,811
It was like,
I'm gonna be you, Dad.

1447
01:16:11,978 --> 01:16:14,315
And the legend continues.

1448
01:16:14,481 --> 01:16:16,317
I'm gonna jump the fountains
at Caesar's Palace

1449
01:16:16,484 --> 01:16:18,236
before I end my career.

1450
01:16:27,831 --> 01:16:29,417
That was for you, Dad.

1451
01:16:29,584 --> 01:16:31,628
Yeah, Robbie broke
all of his dad's records.

1452
01:16:31,795 --> 01:16:34,715
Hell, he could jump 14 buses
with no hands!

1453
01:16:37,218 --> 01:16:41,682
But Robbie was jumping
on lighter more powerful bikes

1454
01:16:41,849 --> 01:16:44,102
that were designed for jumping.

1455
01:16:44,269 --> 01:16:46,271
He could jump
farther and longer than Evel.

1456
01:16:46,438 --> 01:16:47,481
But it didn't matter.

1457
01:16:47,648 --> 01:16:48,816
Robbie couldn't tell a story.

1458
01:16:48,983 --> 01:16:50,902
He was...
he was not a showman.

1459
01:16:51,069 --> 01:16:52,613
Knievel was the ultimate showman.

1460
01:16:52,779 --> 01:16:56,784
A guy could sing longer and louder
than Elvis Presley.

1461
01:16:56,951 --> 01:16:59,329
But who gave a damn?

1462
01:16:59,496 --> 01:17:01,374
He was Elvis Presley.

1463
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:03,251
My dad was Evel Knievel.

1464
01:17:03,418 --> 01:17:08,925
AUDIENCE LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE

1465
01:17:09,092 --> 01:17:11,052
Even when
Bobbie wasn't jumping anymore

1466
01:17:11,219 --> 01:17:13,222
he still wanted
to be in the spotlight.

1467
01:17:13,389 --> 01:17:15,433
He had to find other things to do

1468
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,769
to get himself attention.

1469
01:17:17,936 --> 01:17:19,396
One of his projects was Hollywood.

1470
01:17:19,563 --> 01:17:22,316
♪ Viva, viva, Knievel...

1471
01:17:22,483 --> 01:17:26,572
In the end, there was one guy
that was meant to be Evel Knievel.

1472
01:17:26,739 --> 01:17:28,241
And that was Evel.

1473
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,495
Evel had a movie star quality
about him.

1474
01:17:31,662 --> 01:17:33,247
There's no doubt about it.

1475
01:17:33,414 --> 01:17:35,041
Not when he tried to act.

1476
01:17:35,208 --> 01:17:37,210
Look at you.
You're trying to destroy yourself.

1477
01:17:37,377 --> 01:17:39,630
If you don't believe me
here's the proof.

1478
01:17:39,797 --> 01:17:42,675
I'm not gonna let
you commit suicide around me.

1479
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:48,057
He performed for the audience.

1480
01:17:48,224 --> 01:17:50,226
But when it came
to the acting part

1481
01:17:50,393 --> 01:17:51,687
I guess there's a difference.

1482
01:17:51,854 --> 01:17:53,773
That was too far!
Stop it!

1483
01:17:53,939 --> 01:17:55,316
Alright...
Stop it!

1484
01:17:55,483 --> 01:17:57,861
Any way you want it, man!
Stop it!

1485
01:17:58,028 --> 01:17:59,405
Once it came out, yeah

1486
01:17:59,572 --> 01:18:02,242
it was a movie
that wasn't really well received.

1487
01:18:03,952 --> 01:18:06,664
♪ Viva...

1488
01:18:06,831 --> 01:18:09,668
I guess the exciting part
is the jump, huh.

1489
01:18:13,839 --> 01:18:15,341
We've got the Melindas
on the high wire

1490
01:18:15,508 --> 01:18:18,011
and the medallists on the edge
of the canyon on a motorcycle...

1491
01:18:18,178 --> 01:18:21,516
When I knew I was gonna take
on the Snake River Canyon event

1492
01:18:21,683 --> 01:18:24,269
I decided something
very important...

1493
01:18:24,436 --> 01:18:26,814
that I would write a book.

1494
01:18:26,981 --> 01:18:28,316
In legacy,

1495
01:18:28,483 --> 01:18:32,363
that people could read
about the Evel Knievel promotion

1496
01:18:32,530 --> 01:18:33,865
of the Snake River Canyon.

1497
01:18:34,031 --> 01:18:37,411
Knievel was my fifty-fifty partner
and he says

1498
01:18:37,578 --> 01:18:40,373
"Don't forget, just tell the truth."

1499
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:42,083
So with permission

01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:47,340
I carried an audio cassette recorder
during the Evel Knievel tour.

1501
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,730
If you listen to the tape
you can form your own opinion.

1502
01:19:28,308 --> 01:19:31,979
And so when I wrote my book
I kept out a lot of things,

1503
01:19:32,146 --> 01:19:33,940
stuff that I would never
write about

1504
01:19:34,107 --> 01:19:36,151
cause, remember,
when the book was coming out

1505
01:19:36,318 --> 01:19:38,362
I was still protecting his image.

1506
01:19:38,529 --> 01:19:41,074
Evel's attorney,
he checked everything.

1507
01:19:41,241 --> 01:19:42,993
Told me
that it had Evel's approval

1508
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:44,495
in writing.

1509
01:19:44,662 --> 01:19:46,622
Then the book was published.

1510
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:49,292
I was at Evel's compound one day.

1511
01:19:49,459 --> 01:19:51,212
He throws me this book.

1512
01:19:52,296 --> 01:19:55,801
He says "Here keep this.
It'll be worth some money someday."

1513
01:19:55,968 --> 01:19:57,678
I open it up.

1514
01:19:57,845 --> 01:20:00,515
Here's all his footnotes in there.

1515
01:20:00,682 --> 01:20:04,520
The first part of the book,
X-rated Evel.

1516
01:20:04,687 --> 01:20:07,941
He writes in there
"Constitutes adultery."

1517
01:20:08,734 --> 01:20:11,487
Right from the get go
you could tell he was mad.

1518
01:20:11,654 --> 01:20:15,367
It just starts and you can tell
that the farther it gets in the book

1519
01:20:15,534 --> 01:20:16,910
the madder he got.

1520
01:20:17,077 --> 01:20:19,122
"This is a lie and not accurate.

1521
01:20:20,039 --> 01:20:22,751
"Lies... lies... lies."

1522
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:24,628
I read the book
and said

1523
01:20:24,795 --> 01:20:27,006
"Yeah...
what's the problem?"

1524
01:20:28,425 --> 01:20:31,095
"He could've said
a lot more worse stuff."

1525
01:20:31,846 --> 01:20:33,598
I read the book a couple times.

1526
01:20:33,765 --> 01:20:35,893
I didn't see anything in it bad.
Nothing.

1527
01:20:36,059 --> 01:20:40,064
It was very factual.
Very, very, very factual.

1528
01:20:40,231 --> 01:20:45,446
I think that Shelly, who wrote it,
was accurate.

1529
01:20:45,613 --> 01:20:48,033
And...

1530
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,828
it made him really mad.

1531
01:20:52,789 --> 01:20:55,208
I was on the 20th Century Fox lot.

1532
01:20:55,375 --> 01:20:56,877
All of a sudden
I saw Evel

1533
01:20:57,044 --> 01:20:59,506
with a big smile
coming at me loping along.

1534
01:21:00,966 --> 01:21:03,469
I was actually glad to see him.
The book was out.

1535
01:21:03,636 --> 01:21:06,723
I was like maybe I can even talk him
into doing some promotion with me.

1536
01:21:06,890 --> 01:21:08,267
I said "Hey, Evel."

1537
01:21:08,433 --> 01:21:12,105
And all of a sudden, my hands...
they were held behind my back.

1538
01:21:12,272 --> 01:21:14,024
They tell me it was two men.

1539
01:21:14,191 --> 01:21:15,818
It may have been one.
It may have been two.

1540
01:21:15,985 --> 01:21:18,613
And he...
He came at me

1541
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:22,117
with a bat...
an aluminium baseball bat.

1542
01:21:22,284 --> 01:21:25,371
He said "I'm gonna kill you,
you son of a bitch."

1543
01:21:25,538 --> 01:21:28,333
I did everything I could
to defend myself.

1544
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,002
I remember putting my hand up

1545
01:21:30,169 --> 01:21:32,130
and said "What are you doing?
What are you doing?"

1546
01:21:32,297 --> 01:21:33,590
I was fighting for my life.

1547
01:21:33,757 --> 01:21:36,594
He was whaling on me
and then I passed out.

being Knievel for ten minutes.

1555
01:21:56,827 --> 01:22:00,040
It was a very interesting hour
at Division 91 on Municipal Court,

1556
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:02,376
in which Evel Knievel
fired his attorney

1557
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:04,253
and entered a plea of guilty.

1558
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:06,715
He fires them
and says to the judge

1559
01:22:06,882 --> 01:22:09,135
"Judge, I did it
and I'd do it again.

"Do what you will with me."

You know,

in the street.

01:22:19,981 --> 01:22:21,901
You don't settle them
with lawyers.

1565
01:22:22,067 --> 01:22:27,074
Evel always settled it
with his fists

1566
01:22:27,241 --> 01:22:29,160
or sometimes a tool helped.

1567

of guilt as refreshing

at the same time,

1587
01:23:20,516 --> 01:23:23,937
long ago we abandoned
frontier justice in California.

1588
01:23:24,104 --> 01:23:26,565
With that Rafiti sentenced Knievel
to six months in jail

and three years probation.

it was like,
I think in his own way...

01:27:23,028 --> 01:27:24,405
a pelvis reconstruction,

1667
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:27,200
a spinal fusion,
a liver transplant...

1668
01:27:27,367 --> 01:27:29,745
seven or eight bouts
of staph infection.

1669
01:27:30,538 --> 01:27:33,333
I have hepatitis C and I got it
through blood transfusion.

1670
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:35,460
My doctors told me
five years ago

1671
01:27:35,627 --> 01:27:38,005
that I didn't have
five years to live.

1672
01:27:38,172 --> 01:27:40,675
I'm taking it one day at a time.

1673
01:27:40,842 --> 01:27:43,220
I really felt sorry for him.
I did, really.

1674
01:27:43,387 --> 01:27:45,014
I said "You're really hurting."

1675
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,439
♪ If you're gonna be dumb
you gotta be tough

1676
01:27:52,982 --> 01:27:56,654
When you get knocked down
you gotta get back up

1677
01:27:57,697 --> 01:27:59,741
I ain't the sharpest knife
in the drawer

1678
01:27:59,908 --> 01:28:01,660
But I know enough to know

1679
01:28:01,827 --> 01:28:04,580
If you're gonna be dumb
you gotta be tough

1680
01:28:05,623 --> 01:28:07,292
Then the 90s come around.

1681
01:28:07,459 --> 01:28:12,590
Motorcycle jumping was just one part
of this whole new huge thing

1682
01:28:12,757 --> 01:28:15,427
called action sports.

1683
01:28:15,594 --> 01:28:17,555
Its amazing how quickly
the sport's progressed.

1684
01:28:18,181 --> 01:28:21,226
This multimillion
motorcycle jumping,

1685
01:28:21,393 --> 01:28:23,646
skateboard riding, surfing industry

1686
01:28:23,813 --> 01:28:25,482
has definitely come a long way

1687
01:28:25,648 --> 01:28:27,734
from daredevils to professionals.

1688
01:28:29,153 --> 01:28:31,906
In 2006, I was able
to land the first double backflip

1689
01:28:32,073 --> 01:28:33,200
on a dirt bike.

1690
01:28:33,366 --> 01:28:35,661
No one ever thought
that was possible.

1691
01:28:36,370 --> 01:28:38,915
The bikes have evolved.
The riding has evolved.

1692
01:28:39,082 --> 01:28:41,877
They have coaches,
schools, camps.

1693
01:28:42,044 --> 01:28:43,546
But the spirit will never die.

1694
01:28:43,713 --> 01:28:46,466
Evel was the one that
set our foundation for the future.

1695
01:28:48,093 --> 01:28:50,346
The thing about the Knievels
that's really captivating

1696
01:28:50,513 --> 01:28:51,848
inspiring to all of us

1697
01:28:52,015 --> 01:28:53,558
is the showmanship side of it.

1698
01:28:57,438 --> 01:28:59,149
I stay awake at night

1699
01:28:59,316 --> 01:29:03,321
and I dwell on how to do what I do
in the biggest and grandest way

1700
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,989
and continue this legacy.

1701
01:29:05,532 --> 01:29:08,118
Fire!
That's deadly! Oooh!

1702
01:29:08,285 --> 01:29:10,329
The extreme sports
or action sports,

1703
01:29:10,496 --> 01:29:11,831
whatever it's
commercially referred to,

1704
01:29:11,998 --> 01:29:17,213
is definitely a result
of the way Evel dreamed in the 70s

1705
01:29:17,380 --> 01:29:19,758
and how he wanted
to push the limits.

1706
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:28,227
You can do stunts on television?

1707
01:29:44,497 --> 01:29:46,917
Evel had to make his jumps.

1708
01:29:47,084 --> 01:29:49,962
The stunts I do
I know they are gonna fail.

1709
01:29:55,553 --> 01:29:57,388
Mat Hoffman and I
did a tribute to Evel.

1710
01:29:57,555 --> 01:29:58,723
Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville

1711
01:29:58,890 --> 01:30:00,935
and I'm about
to back-flip this bike.

1712
01:30:01,101 --> 01:30:02,562
I think we should push the limits,

1713
01:30:02,728 --> 01:30:04,981
get some of our friends together,
set some records

1714
01:30:05,148 --> 01:30:07,067
and just celebrate Evel's life.

1715
01:30:07,234 --> 01:30:09,362
So we did.

1716
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:10,572
Ow!

1717
01:30:14,493 --> 01:30:17,706
I broke my dick...
in that tribute.

1718
01:30:17,872 --> 01:30:19,207
Oww... oww...
You okay?

1719
01:30:19,374 --> 01:30:20,793
Oh, yeah, I feel great.

1720
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:23,463
No really...
I tore my urethra.

1721
01:30:24,089 --> 01:30:26,425
Thanks a lot, Evel.

1722
01:30:32,724 --> 01:30:34,936
Yeah, I've definitely been compared
to Evel Knievel.

1723
01:30:35,102 --> 01:30:37,105
I think
that is because of the fact

1724
01:30:37,272 --> 01:30:39,358
that I have had some big crashes.

1725
01:30:40,985 --> 01:30:43,989
I figured I'd see how far
I can fly the Harley Davidson

1726
01:30:44,155 --> 01:30:45,574
in honour of Evel Knievel.

1727
01:30:49,495 --> 01:30:53,250
When Seth Enslow did that
record-breaking Harley Davidson jump

1728
01:30:53,417 --> 01:30:55,336
he dedicated it to Evel.

1729
01:30:57,130 --> 01:31:00,718
When Robbie Madision set the world
record for distance bike jumping

1730
01:31:00,885 --> 01:31:04,639
over an entire football field

1731
01:31:04,806 --> 01:31:08,853
he did it on the 40th anniversary
of Evel's Caesar's Palace jump.

1732
01:31:18,156 --> 01:31:20,952
Evel Knievel was always
in the back of my mind.

1733
01:31:21,118 --> 01:31:23,997
It wasn't like
we had forgotten about him.

1734
01:31:24,164 --> 01:31:26,417
We didn't really know
what he was up to.

1735
01:31:26,584 --> 01:31:29,546
People started
asking what he was up to.

1736
01:31:29,713 --> 01:31:33,968
ANNOUNCER: The one and only OG...
Evel Knievel!

1737
01:31:34,135 --> 01:31:36,304
It was great to see a new generation

1738
01:31:36,471 --> 01:31:38,265
understand how important
he was to us.

1739
01:31:38,432 --> 01:31:40,893
Somehow we raised his profile again

1740
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:42,771
but he deserved that all along.

1741
01:31:43,647 --> 01:31:47,318
He greatly appreciated that
the kids paid their respects to him.

1742
01:31:47,485 --> 01:31:49,529
They did.
And he was amazed by that.

1743
01:31:49,696 --> 01:31:55,870
Don't ever forget,
you can fall many times in life.

1744
01:31:56,037 --> 01:32:01,252
But you will never be a failure
as long as you try and get up.

1745
01:32:01,419 --> 01:32:02,879
I think
my dad liked his role

1746
01:32:03,046 --> 01:32:05,549
as an elder statesman
at the end of his life.

1747
01:32:05,716 --> 01:32:06,884
He thought it was really cool.

1748
01:32:07,051 --> 01:32:09,888
And where he deserved to be.
Deservedly so.

1749
01:32:10,055 --> 01:32:14,686
I'm looking forward to seeing
what happens in the next 20 years

1750
01:32:14,853 --> 01:32:16,730
if I'm so lucky to live that long.

1751
01:32:16,897 --> 01:32:20,193
I've had to have a hip replacement,
a complete hip replacement.

1752
01:32:20,359 --> 01:32:22,571
I had to have a...

1753
01:32:24,949 --> 01:32:27,285
Guys, I'm really having problems.

1754
01:32:29,037 --> 01:32:30,831
Why don't we...

1755
01:32:30,998 --> 01:32:32,708
Please.

1756
01:32:32,875 --> 01:32:35,795
After a lifetime
of injuries and surgeries

1757
01:32:35,962 --> 01:32:39,842
the thing that really kicked his ass
was lung disease.

1758
01:32:41,886 --> 01:32:44,181
If you'd asked him

1759
01:32:44,348 --> 01:32:47,101
"Would you rather have lived
this long, Bobby

1760
01:32:47,268 --> 01:32:49,896
and been this sick

1761
01:32:50,063 --> 01:32:52,483
"or died at the end of the ramp?"

1762
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:55,403
I think he would have chosen
the end of the ramp.

1763
01:32:57,448 --> 01:33:00,201
The last couple of years
of his life were hell.

1764
01:33:00,368 --> 01:33:02,162
He was having trouble breathing.

1765
01:33:02,329 --> 01:33:04,164
Being in that living hell...

1766
01:33:05,625 --> 01:33:09,045
he put his life in perspective.

1767
01:33:09,755 --> 01:33:13,301
I think he probably thought
a lot about the things he'd done

1768
01:33:13,468 --> 01:33:16,471
and thought about how badly
he treated some people.

1769
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:23,814
He was preparing for the end
on every level.

1770
01:33:23,981 --> 01:33:27,402
He righted a lot of wrongs
with people

1771
01:33:27,569 --> 01:33:30,406
because he felt like
that was important.

1772
01:33:30,572 --> 01:33:31,907
It became important to him.

1773
01:33:35,495 --> 01:33:40,335
He told me he'd led a life that
he was ashamed of in a lot of ways

1774
01:33:40,502 --> 01:33:44,966
and he was just trying to talk to
the people that he truly...

1775
01:33:45,132 --> 01:33:46,259
that truly meant something to him

1776
01:33:46,426 --> 01:33:48,929
was the way he put it
and he put it right.

1777
01:33:50,014 --> 01:33:54,311
He said to me
"I was so sick."

1778
01:33:54,477 --> 01:34:00,151
He said "I was just a sick person
with women... so wrong."

1779
01:34:00,318 --> 01:34:04,323
I said "Oh Dad,
it's so good to hear you say that."

1780
01:34:06,117 --> 01:34:09,371
He tried to make amends with people
at the end and that's great.

1781
01:34:09,538 --> 01:34:10,873
But it's kind of tough

1782
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:14,377
to put the toothpaste back
in the tube at that point.

1783
01:34:14,544 --> 01:34:16,755
He caused a lot of hurt.

1784
01:34:17,506 --> 01:34:20,760
Well, it was the first time
I ever heard him say "I'm sorry."

1785
01:34:20,927 --> 01:34:24,348
He was pretty much
on his deathbed... yeah.

1786
01:34:25,892 --> 01:34:28,729
He just said "I'm sorry."
That was it.

1787
01:34:29,897 --> 01:34:31,899
You know...

1788
01:34:32,066 --> 01:34:34,945
the most important thing
in life...

1789
01:34:35,112 --> 01:34:36,739
that really counts

1790
01:34:36,906 --> 01:34:39,325
is your scorecard with God.

1791
01:34:39,492 --> 01:34:42,830
The real Bob Knievel,
the Bobby Knievel,

1792
01:34:42,997 --> 01:34:46,668
that's the guy I knew
and that's the guy that I loved.

1793
01:34:47,461 --> 01:34:51,340
That's the guy that
was emerging back out of the slime.

1794
01:34:52,091 --> 01:34:55,596
And... I was moved by it.

1795
01:35:00,101 --> 01:35:02,730
I talked to him
the night before he died.

1796
01:35:02,897 --> 01:35:04,482
He said
"You gotta do me a favour"

1797
01:35:04,649 --> 01:35:06,651
and I says "Okay, what?"

1798
01:35:06,818 --> 01:35:11,240
And he says "Say a prayer for me
once and a while."

1799
01:35:11,866 --> 01:35:13,493
I said "Okay, all right."

1800
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:15,955
He says "I'm worse than you think."

1801
01:35:18,041 --> 01:35:20,377
I was on the phone with Evel.

1802
01:35:20,544 --> 01:35:22,838
He started coughing.

1803
01:35:23,005 --> 01:35:24,924
The phone dropped.

1804
01:35:25,091 --> 01:35:26,885
He went unconscious.

1805
01:35:32,434 --> 01:35:34,561
So that was it.

1806
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:39,734
But it was hard.

1807
01:35:39,901 --> 01:35:42,321
I wasn't ready.

1808
01:35:44,908 --> 01:35:47,786
But, he was ready.

1809
01:35:48,871 --> 01:35:51,374
And that's what was important.

1810
01:35:59,009 --> 01:36:04,057
You just never thought
that Evel was gonna die.

1811
01:36:05,266 --> 01:36:10,189
You know, he was indestructible
and then...

1812
01:36:10,982 --> 01:36:15,196
It just reminded you
that he was human.

1813
01:36:18,032 --> 01:36:22,038
I didn't lose the daredevil.

1814
01:36:23,414 --> 01:36:24,916
I lost this little kid,

1815
01:36:25,083 --> 01:36:28,254
who at one time
I thought was my brother.

1816
01:36:30,214 --> 01:36:33,176
That's the indelible Knievel to me.

1817
01:36:36,597 --> 01:36:39,017
I still think he's a superhero.

1818
01:36:40,728 --> 01:36:43,898
Yeah, I know
a more complete story now.

1819
01:36:44,065 --> 01:36:47,903
Some of the stuff
is really hear-breaking.

1820
01:36:48,571 --> 01:36:50,073
But to me...

1821
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:51,491
what he did

1822
01:36:51,658 --> 01:36:53,744
transcends that.

1823
01:36:55,121 --> 01:36:57,540
Most of us
don't take chances in our lives.

1824
01:36:57,707 --> 01:37:00,711
Most of us aren't willing
to lay it on the line

1825
01:37:00,878 --> 01:37:02,964
like he was.

1826
01:37:03,757 --> 01:37:05,801
What my dad did,

1827
01:37:05,968 --> 01:37:08,888
nobody is ever gonna do again.

1828
01:37:09,055 --> 01:37:11,808
But there is a little Evel
in all of us.

1829
01:37:14,145 --> 01:37:17,315
I guess I'd like to have him
remembered as...

1830
01:37:18,775 --> 01:37:22,822
a man, who,
when he was down, got back up.

1831
01:37:24,324 --> 01:37:27,119
He never quit.

1832
01:37:29,873 --> 01:37:31,959
I think in fairness to him

1833
01:37:32,125 --> 01:37:38,008
we should not remember
the evil that Evel did.

1834
01:37:38,175 --> 01:37:43,556
Instead, he should be remembered
for the good things he did.

1835
01:37:45,225 --> 01:37:47,061
In times of stress

1836
01:37:47,228 --> 01:37:51,233
I believe that somebody on a white
horse in a white hat will arrive...

1837
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,778
that's the American way.

1838
01:37:53,944 --> 01:37:55,405
Life's pretty tough.

1839
01:37:57,282 --> 01:37:59,493
Life can be pretty fucking tough.

1840
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:01,454
And...

1841
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:06,460
you need your heroes, man.

1842
01:38:09,422 --> 01:38:11,216
He used to always say to me

1843
01:38:11,383 --> 01:38:13,886
"That canyon
has not moved one inch.

1844
01:38:14,053 --> 01:38:18,100
"And I do not see a long line
of daredevils waiting to jump it."
