I saw you serve a woman!
I saw you with my own eyes!

Parvana.

It's the only thing
of value we have left.

16
00:02:13,615 --> 00:02:17,550
I never wore it.
Not even once.

17
00:02:17,552 --> 00:02:19,985
Where would you wear it,
Parvana?

18
00:02:19,987 --> 00:02:23,690
- Let's continue your studies. All right?
- Yes, Baba.

19
00:02:23,692 --> 00:02:28,829
Now, what can you tell me
about the Silk Road?

20
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:30,566
The Silk Road.

21
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,338
Baba, I can't remember
about the Silk Road.

22
00:02:36,137 --> 00:02:38,938
Maybe if we think of it
like a story.

23
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,709
Stories remain in our hearts
even when all else is gone.

24
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:46,545
Our people have always told
stories, from our very beginning,

25
00:02:46,547 --> 00:02:48,784
when we were Parthia
and Khorasan.

26

[Baba] <i>A fractured land in the
claws of the Hindu Kush mountains,</i>

00:02:55,456 --> 00:02:59,658
<i>scorched by the fiery eyes
of the Northern Deserts,</i>

28
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,696
<i>black rubble earth

29
00:03:02,698 --> 00:03:06,736
<i>Our land was the petrified
skeleton of a monster.</i>

30
00:03:07,802 --> 00:03:09,468
<i>We were</i> Ariana,

31
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,940
<i>the land of the noble
and honorable.</i>

32
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:16,143
<i>We were a pathway
to everywhere,</i>

33
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:18,814
<i>carrying goods
from east to west.</i>

34
00:03:20,015 --> 00:03:21,680
<i>We studied the stars</i>

35
00:03:21,682 --> 00:03:24,884
<i>and began to see order
amidst the chaos.</i>

36
00:03:24,886 --> 00:03:28,954
<i>We were scientists,
philosophers, and storytellers.</i>

37
00:03:28,956 --> 00:03:32,626
<i>Questions sought answers
and then more questions.</i>

38
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:36,128
<i>We began to see our place
in the universe.</i>

39
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,833
<i>But we were at the edges of
empires at war with each other,</i>

40
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:42,668
<i>as borders were defined
and redefined...</i>

- [shouting, horses whinnying]
- <i>over thousands of years.</i>

42
00:03:46,874 --> 00:03:50,746
<i>Of these mighty rulers
came Cyrus the Great of Persia.</i>

43
00:03:52,647 --> 00:03:55,550
<i>Then Alexander the Great
of Macedon.</i>

44
00:03:56,184 --> 00:03:58,884
<i>There came the Mauryan Empire,</i>

45
00:03:58,886 --> 00:04:00,821
<i>Genghis Khan,</i>

46
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,190
<i>and so on and so on.</i>

47
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:05,758
<i>Each time
there was bloodshed,</i>

48
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,963
<i>and each time
there were survivors.</i>

49
00:04:09,063 --> 00:04:11,566
<i>A pattern repeating itself
endlessly.</i>

00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:20,907
<i>I knew what peace felt like,
here in this city.</i>

53
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:25,078
<i>Children went to school,
women went to university.</i>

54
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,881
<i>All the empires
forgot about us,</i>

55
00:04:27,883 --> 00:04:29,082
<i>for a while at least.</i>

56
00:04:29,084 --> 00:04:30,684

00:04:35,556 --> 00:04:37,890
<i>always uncertain.</i>

60
00:04:37,892 --> 00:04:41,126
<i>First came a coup d'état,
then an invasion,</i>

61
00:04:41,128 --> 00:04:42,831
<i>then a civil war.</i>

62
00:04:43,998 --> 00:04:45,564
<i>In the chaos,</i>

63
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:48,703
<i>some looked to those
who might restore order.</i>

64
00:04:50,072 --> 00:04:51,737
<i>But at a great cost.</i>

65
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:55,107
[man shouting] We have determined
specific dignity for women!

66
00:04:55,109 --> 00:04:59,212
Women should not go outside and
attract unnecessary attention!

67
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:03,749
If a woman shows herself, she will
be cursed by the Islamic Sharia

68
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:06,152
and should never expect
to go to heaven.

69
00:05:06,154 --> 00:05:08,722
Everything changes,
Parvana.

70
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:10,827
Stories remind us of that.

71
00:05:14,762 --> 00:05:17,864
Parvana, were you
listening at all?

72
00:05:17,866 --> 00:05:19,131
Yes, Baba.

73
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:23,003
Why don't you tell me
about our nomadic ancestors

74
00:05:23,005 --> 00:05:25,541
and their hills of gold?

75
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:27,907
Well?

76
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:29,678
2,000 years ago...

77
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:33,748
- Yes?
- 2,000 years ago...

78
00:05:34,782 --> 00:05:37,883
[Parvana]
<i>there was a Bactrian princess</i>

79
00:05:37,885 --> 00:05:40,320

80
00:05:40,322 --> 00:05:42,289
[Baba]
<i>And?</i>

81
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,157
- [Parvana] <i>And...</i>
- <i>Parvana?</i>

82
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,626
Away.
Keep away from my things.

83
00:05:46,628 --> 00:05:49,895
Go away. I said go
away, you silly dog!

84
00:05:49,897 --> 00:05:52,832
Hey, you! What do you
think you're doing?

85
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:54,099
Why is this girl
shouting?

86
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:56,335
She is only a child.
She meant nothing by it.

87
00:05:56,337 --> 00:05:58,104
She's drawing attention
to herself!

88
00:05:58,106 --> 00:06:00,674
She should be at home, not
displaying herself in the market.

89
00:06:00,676 --> 00:06:04,010
I have no son at home, except an infant.
I need my daughter to help me.

90
00:06:04,012 --> 00:06:05,679
- Stand up when we talk to you.
- I am a cr...

91
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:06,983
I said stand up!

92
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:11,120
[groans]

93
00:06:13,722 --> 00:06:15,854
- I know you.
- Yes, Idrees.

94
00:06:15,856 --> 00:06:18,090
I was your teacher once.
You were a good student.

95
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:20,994
You wasted my time, teaching
me things of no worth.

96
00:06:20,996 --> 00:06:24,631
I have joined the Taliban and now
I fight the enemies of Islam.

97
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:29,201
Well, if I am an enemy, then for
my sins God has taken my leg.

98
00:06:29,203 --> 00:06:31,071
Are you making fun of me,
old man?

99
00:06:31,073 --> 00:06:34,708
I lost my leg in the war.
The war we fought together.

100
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,876
- How old is the girl?
- Idrees.

101
00:06:36,878 --> 00:06:38,845
- She is a child.
- She's old enough to marry.

102
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,679
I'll be looking
for a wife soon.

103
00:06:40,681 --> 00:06:42,681
She's already been promised
to someone.

104
00:06:42,683 --> 00:06:44,383
Well, she should
cover herself properly.

105
00:06:44,385 --> 00:06:46,785
- Maybe you should stop looking at her.
- What did you say to me?

106
00:06:46,787 --> 00:06:48,955
I said
stop looking at her.

107
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:50,823
- I can have you killed!
- Idrees.

108
00:06:50,825 --> 00:06:53,025
- You watch what you say!
- That's enough. Come on.

109
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:55,729
[exhales]

110
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:57,364
Are you all right?

111
00:06:57,366 --> 00:06:59,198
Yes, Baba.

112
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,736
That's my girl.

113
00:07:01,236 --> 00:07:02,837
Let's go home now.

114
00:07:16,318 --> 00:07:18,318
[sighs]

115
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,956
Parvana?

116
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:24,224
You told that boy
I was promised to someone.

117
00:07:24,226 --> 00:07:26,059
Am I getting married?

118
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:28,861
[chuckling] Of course not.
You are still a child.

119
00:07:28,863 --> 00:07:31,263
I want you playing
and telling stories.

120
00:07:31,265 --> 00:07:33,133
I'm too old for that now.

121
00:07:33,135 --> 00:07:36,236
Too old for stories?
You've always loved stories.

122
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:38,174
What's the use?

123
00:07:50,152 --> 00:07:52,986
I'll have a word with Mama-jan
and we'll sort it all out.

124
00:07:52,988 --> 00:07:54,720
Please don't mention
the dress.

125
00:07:54,722 --> 00:07:58,960
[humming]

126
00:07:59,995 --> 00:08:02,895
Then I'll never
hear the end of it.

127
00:08:02,897 --> 00:08:05,231
- The end of what?
- Nothing, Mama-jan.

128
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:07,866
[Baba] We're not selling
Parvana's good dress.

129
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:10,369
Baba, that's not
what I meant.

130
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:12,438
We need the money,
Baba.

131
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,241
We'll hold off for a bit. I
think business will pick up.

132
00:08:16,243 --> 00:08:19,311
If business picks up, then we
won't have to sell it, sure.

133
00:08:19,313 --> 00:08:23,117
But the sky is far and the earth is hard.
We will have to sell it soon.

134
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:25,184
Well, what about a little story
before dinner?

135
00:08:25,186 --> 00:08:28,787
And we'll forget all about
dresses for a while.

136
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:31,357
Maybe Parvana would like
to read something for us?

137
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:34,060
Not right now, Mama-jan.
I'm tired.

138
00:08:34,062 --> 00:08:36,930
[chuckles] She's not a child
anymore, she tells me.

139
00:08:36,932 --> 00:08:39,199
So she doesn't
like stories.

140
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:42,801
Don't be in such a hurry
to grow up, my sweet girl.

141
00:08:42,803 --> 00:08:45,171
It might not be
all that you expect.

142
00:08:45,173 --> 00:08:48,441
We're out of water. You didn't
bring enough this morning.

143
00:08:48,443 --> 00:08:50,375
But there's half a bucket
by the door.

144
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:54,480
When I was young enough to fetch
water, the buckets were never empty.

145
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:56,349
- Hey!
- [mother] Girls, stop it.

146
00:08:56,351 --> 00:08:59,418
- Either you go out and get more water after dinner...
- [humming]

147
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,921
or you can wash
Zaki's dirty diapers.

148
00:09:01,923 --> 00:09:04,456
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

149
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,925
Now that you're here.

150
00:09:05,927 --> 00:09:11,064
Maybe if you didn't wash your hair so
much, we wouldn't run out so quickly.

151
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:13,999
- Parvana.
- [Baba] You should have some respect.

152
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:16,802
Why don't you eat,
hmm?

153
00:09:16,804 --> 00:09:21,043
- Things always look better when your belly is full.
- Yes, Maudar.

154
00:09:26,814 --> 00:09:29,851
[babbling]

155
00:09:31,986 --> 00:09:34,387
Zaki, Zaki, wait till I
pull up your sleeves.

156
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:35,989
No, Mama-jan.

157
00:09:35,991 --> 00:09:38,992
- There. There you go.
- [babbling continues]

158
00:09:38,994 --> 00:09:43,128
Don't eat all the raisins, Parvana.
Leave them for Zaki.

159
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,465
Why don't you give him that big
raisin on your chin, Soraya?

160
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:48,835
Oh, but it's
not a raisin.

161
00:09:48,837 --> 00:09:50,939
It's a big,
hairy mole.

162
00:09:51,807 --> 00:09:54,342
Parvana,
apologize to Soraya.

163
00:09:58,145 --> 00:09:59,781
Parvana?

164
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:05,884
[knocking on door]

165
00:10:05,886 --> 00:10:08,153
[Idrees]
He's in there! I saw him!

166
00:10:08,155 --> 00:10:09,922
- [man shouting] If there are women present...
- Baba?

167
00:10:09,924 --> 00:10:11,794
Cover yourselves now!

168
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:16,128
That's the man.
An enemy of Islam.

169
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,398
He's got forbidden books, and he's
teaching the women with them!

170
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,301
- Leave us be!
- He's done nothing!

171
00:10:21,303 --> 00:10:26,205
- Nurullah Alizai, you must come with us.
- [all shouting]

172
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:27,574
Baba!

173
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:30,143
- You can't take him!
- Baba!

174
00:10:30,145 --> 00:10:32,277
- [screams, groans]
- Baba-jan!

175
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,379
[Zaki crying]

176
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:36,215
Where is he being taken?

177
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:38,218
To prison.

178
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,123
They'll teach him a good lesson
in Pul-e-Charkhi.

179
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:44,224
- [sobbing]
- Baba!

180
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,892
Baba!

181
00:10:45,894 --> 00:10:47,527
[engine starts]

182
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:49,331
[gasps]

183
00:11:07,515 --> 00:11:11,484
Mama-jan?
Can I light the lamp?

184
00:11:11,486 --> 00:11:14,921
Hush, Parvana.
You'll wake Zaki.

185
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:16,889
But if they
let Baba go,

186
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:19,658
he'll need a light in
the window to see home.

187
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,198
How could he come home? He doesn't
even have his stick to walk with.

188
00:11:25,634 --> 00:11:28,368
Go back to sleep.
It will be all right.

189
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,370
How do you know that, Mama-jan?
How do you know?

190
00:11:31,372 --> 00:11:35,044
Be quiet, Parvana. She has
enough to worry about.

191
00:11:43,518 --> 00:11:46,451
[laughing, babbling]

192
00:11:46,453 --> 00:11:48,388
Hey!
Zaki, stop it.

193
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,989
[squealing, laughing]

194
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:51,990
Get up, Parvana.
Stop playing around.

195
00:11:51,992 --> 00:11:53,558
Why?
What's going on?

196
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,228
You and I
are going to find Baba.

197
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:59,132
The boy said he was being taken to Pul-e-Charkhi
prison, so that's where we are going.

198
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:01,033
But we can't go outside
without Baba.

199
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:03,136
Soraya is writing a letter
for the prison governor

200
00:12:03,138 --> 00:12:05,504
to protest Nurullah's arrest
and ask for his release.

201
00:12:05,506 --> 00:12:08,474
- At least I can give them that.
- Mama-jan, it's not allowed.

202
00:12:08,476 --> 00:12:11,677
We might be all right if we don't
draw attention to ourselves.

203
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:13,479
- But we can't...
- Come on, Parvana.

204
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:16,284
And bring Baba's walking stick.
We have to get going.

205
00:12:23,725 --> 00:12:25,159
[groans]

206
00:12:26,294 --> 00:12:28,029
Mama.

207
00:12:48,382 --> 00:12:50,248
Hey.

208
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,187
Hey, you!

209
00:12:54,555 --> 00:12:57,356
Salaam. Can you tell me
the way to Pul-e-Charkhi?

210
00:12:57,358 --> 00:13:01,661
Salaam. Uh, it's east,
past the river.

211
00:13:01,663 --> 00:13:04,162
- But it's a long way.
- Thank you, sir.

212
00:13:04,164 --> 00:13:07,403
Listen. Go through the old
town, or you'll be caught.

213
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:24,050
[truck stops]

214
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:27,356
- [engine off]
- [door opens, closes]

215
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,190
- Why are you out here by yourself?
- [stammering]

216
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:33,125
- Where is your husband?
- I have no choice.

217
00:13:33,127 --> 00:13:36,061
It's not permitted to be out here
without your husband or your brother.

218
00:13:36,063 --> 00:13:38,096
- I'm sorry. I know.
- Do you understand?

219
00:13:38,098 --> 00:13:41,167
- I am bringing a letter protesting my husband's arrest...
- Just go home.

220
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:42,667
- No!
- What do you mean, "no"?

221
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:44,402
This is Nurullah Alizai,
my husband.

222
00:13:44,404 --> 00:13:47,105
- He was arrested last night with no charges laid against him.
- Photographs are forbidden!

223
00:13:47,107 --> 00:13:50,542
- I have no one at home...
- What are you doing, showing me a photograph?

224
00:13:50,544 --> 00:13:54,047
- Out here by yourself. Go home!
- There is no one in my house except for children.

225
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:58,453
You have no business out here. Do you
understand? Go home. Immediately.

226
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:01,557
You're looking
for trouble now!

227
00:14:10,631 --> 00:14:13,266
You are an insult to your
husband, to your race!

228
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:15,401
I need to find out
what happened to him!

229
00:14:15,403 --> 00:14:19,074
- Shut up!
- [mother screaming, groaning]

230
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:24,013
[man grunting]

231
00:14:33,454 --> 00:14:36,455
Going to the prison
will change nothing.

232
00:14:36,457 --> 00:14:39,258
- [groans]
- If you make trouble like this,

233
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,128
your husband will be punished
severely for your insolence.

234
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,068
And if I find you out here again
by yourself, I will arrest you.

235
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:49,303
Now go.

236
00:14:51,106 --> 00:14:53,572

- More!
- Shh.

244
00:16:07,448 --> 00:16:10,248
Go get water, Parvana.
We have none left.

245
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,621
- [Zaki fussing]
- Come on.

246
00:16:41,915 --> 00:16:44,218
[man]
Get out!

247
00:16:45,352 --> 00:16:47,555
What are you up to?

248
00:16:48,555 --> 00:16:50,558
Get out of here.
They'll see you!

[man, faint]
Hey, stop!

Stop when I tell you!

Through here!

252
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:06,272
Stop!

253
00:17:06,274 --> 00:17:07,872
Where did
that boy go?

254
00:17:07,874 --> 00:17:09,577
Did you see?
Did you see?

255
00:17:11,478 --> 00:17:13,446
- Hey, you! Girl!
- Hey!

256
00:17:13,448 --> 00:17:15,583
- Come on!
- Forget about her!

257
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:22,955
Parvana, this is
only half a bucket.

258
00:17:22,957 --> 00:17:24,823
Couldn't you fill them up
all the way?

259
00:17:24,825 --> 00:17:28,494
- [babbling, fussing]
- Zaki, shh. Don't wake her.

- Hush, Zaki.
- Mama-jan!

261
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:33,733
- Shh.
- Sooth him, Parvana.

Mama...

One time
in the distant past,

266
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:44,909
there was a little village at the
foot of the Hindu Kush mountains.

267
00:17:44,911 --> 00:17:47,812
- I want Mama-jan.
- Shh. Listen.

268
00:17:47,814 --> 00:17:52,284
The villagers had just managed
to gather precious seeds.

269
00:17:52,286 --> 00:17:56,688
And so, there was dancing and
singing and laughing and eating.

270
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,890
Everyone was happy.

271
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:00,892
<i>Especially for one boy</i>

00:18:00,894 --> 00:18:04,929

singing and laughing and eating,</i>

- [thunderclap]
- [growling, roaring]

278

<i>The monsters frightened the
donkeys and ate the trees.</i>

thing in the whole village...</i>

[screaming, shouting]

<i>the seeds
for next year's crop.</i>

282
00:18:50,812 --> 00:18:54,612
<i>Then they ran back to the Hindu Kush
mountains where their master lay...</i>

283
00:18:54,614 --> 00:18:58,484
<i>the dreadful Elephant King

Salaam, child.
I can't serve you.

But, sir, can I please
have six apples?

00:21:17,158 --> 00:21:19,023
Girl!

311
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:20,461
Hey, stop!

312
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:25,000
Stop when I tell you!

313
00:21:28,201 --> 00:21:30,704
[gasps, groans]

314
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,443
Go! Go home!

315
00:21:38,246 --> 00:21:39,778
[Parvana]
I dropped the bag.

316
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,546
- Hush.
- I lost the money.

317
00:21:41,548 --> 00:21:43,749
- Keep your head back.
- I can get the water though.

318
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:45,821
Don't worry
about that now.

319
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,853
I saved you
a piece of naan.

320
00:21:48,855 --> 00:21:52,493
I'll heat it up for you so it's
nice and fresh. All right?

321
00:22:13,747 --> 00:22:16,749
- [Parvana] What are we going to do?
- I don't know.

322
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:19,984
Maybe if I go out early,
before it's crowded.

323
00:22:19,986 --> 00:22:21,753
It won't work,
Parvana.

324
00:22:21,755 --> 00:22:25,291
Market sellers won't risk getting
in trouble for serving you.

325
00:22:25,293 --> 00:22:27,892
Mama-jan has cousins
in Mazar-e-Sharif.

326
00:22:27,894 --> 00:22:29,994
I could write to them
for help.

327
00:22:29,996 --> 00:22:34,567
But we've never even met them.
How do you know they will help?

328
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:36,037
We need food now.

329
00:24:21,842 --> 00:24:23,775
These were
your brother's clothes.

330
00:24:23,777 --> 00:24:26,981
They will be big,
but we can take them up a bit.

331
00:24:28,381 --> 00:24:31,215
Do I look like
a boy?

332
00:24:31,217 --> 00:24:33,952
You look like
Sulayman.

333
00:24:33,954 --> 00:24:36,155
- So much like him.
- Mama-jan.

334
00:24:36,157 --> 00:24:38,756
He was such a good boy.

335
00:24:38,758 --> 00:24:42,026
Not much older
than you are now.

336
00:24:42,028 --> 00:24:43,130
Shh.

337
00:24:44,364 --> 00:24:46,365
It's all right,
Mama-jan.

338
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:49,901
Parvana is going to the
market for food and water.

339
00:24:49,903 --> 00:24:52,906
It's the only way, Mama-Jan.
We have nothing left.

340
00:25:10,858 --> 00:25:13,224
[chattering
in Afghan language]

341
00:25:13,226 --> 00:25:16,462
But these juices are warm.
I don't want warm juice.

342
00:25:16,464 --> 00:25:19,134
[squawking, clucking]

- [laughing]
- Yes, that's what I said, but you know...

345
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,359
Salaam. Salaam!

346
00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:50,161
Excuse me. Salaam!

347
00:25:50,163 --> 00:25:52,898
Salaam! Salaam!
Come inside, boy!

348
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,071
- I'm not going to deliver, am I?
- [both laughing]

349
00:25:58,238 --> 00:26:01,042
[shopkeeper] But you
know how it goes, right?

350
00:26:03,244 --> 00:26:05,310
Well, let's hear it.

351
00:26:05,312 --> 00:26:10,185
I need a kilo of rice, a half kilo of
lentils, and a small amount of raisins.

352
00:26:11,418 --> 00:26:13,051
A small amount?
[laughs]

353
00:26:13,053 --> 00:26:15,419
Should I go
by my imagination?

354
00:26:15,421 --> 00:26:17,121
- Yes.
- [man laughing]

355
00:26:17,123 --> 00:26:20,058
Not very bright, this one.
[laughs]

356
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,396
Poor iron won't make a sharp sword.
[laughing]

357
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:26,965
Look at him smiling!
[laughs]

358
00:26:26,967 --> 00:26:30,468
Little guy doesn't even know
when he's being made fun of.

359
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,006
Thank you.
Thank you very, very much.

360
00:26:54,061 --> 00:26:56,160
You're spilling
the tea.

361
00:26:56,162 --> 00:26:57,832
Sorry, Uncle.

362
00:27:05,171 --> 00:27:07,406
Who are you? Why were
you staring at me?

363
00:27:07,408 --> 00:27:08,907
- What is your name?
- My name?

364
00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:11,275
- I know you from somewhere.
- No... I wasn't...

365
00:27:11,277 --> 00:27:14,378
- Wasn't what?
- [stammering] You don't know me.

366
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,180
- I do know you.
- No!

367
00:27:16,182 --> 00:27:18,951
- I <i>do</i> know you! You're Parvana!
- I'm not!

368
00:27:18,953 --> 00:27:21,356
I am Shauzia! Remember?
From school?

369
00:27:22,857 --> 00:27:26,058
- Shauzia?
- I had long hair then, but so did you.

370
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,260
- [man] Deliwar.
- Don't tell anyone.

371
00:27:28,262 --> 00:27:29,798
Here's your cap.

372
00:27:31,064 --> 00:27:32,865
You need to get
a boy's name

373
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:35,434
so you don't hesitate
next time somebody asks you.

374
00:27:35,436 --> 00:27:37,301
I am Deliwar now.

375
00:27:37,303 --> 00:27:38,936
It means "brave."

376
00:27:38,938 --> 00:27:41,305
- [man] Where are you?
- I-I have to run.

377
00:27:41,307 --> 00:27:43,410
It was good to see you.

378
00:27:45,144 --> 00:27:46,948
Deliwar.

379
00:27:47,648 --> 00:27:49,615
[Soraya]
Mama-jan, please sit down.

380
00:27:49,617 --> 00:27:54,186
- It will be curfew soon. What if she's not back by then?
- She's fine. I'm...

381
00:27:54,188 --> 00:27:55,520
Who's hungry?

[sighs]

00:27:58,092 --> 00:28:00,324
Praise Allah. He has
returned you to me.

384
00:28:00,326 --> 00:28:03,896
[chuckling] Mama-jan,
you're squashing the naan.

385
00:28:03,898 --> 00:28:05,967
It smells delicious,

It's me. See?

389
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,986
I bought them
especially for you.

- [chuckles]
- Parvana?

If you run out
and get some water,

00:28:34,061 --> 00:28:36,261
he'll get used to you
by the time you come back.

393

- But I'm tired.
- Hurry on, Parvana.

394

It's almost curfew.

[shouting, chattering]

You look
so much like him.

Go change
Sulayman's clothes,

398
00:29:12,632 --> 00:29:14,433
or you'll
get them dirty.

They are already
dirty.

00:29:39,994 --> 00:29:42,530
the poor villagers

we can go to the

No, Parvana,
we can't do that.

- Why not?
- Shh.

It's not that simple,
Parvana.

But we have to try.

439

- There's nothing we can do.
- That's not true.

Stop it, Parvana.
You're upsetting her.

[Idrees] Hey! Hey! I told you to stop!
Why do you keep running?

You should have stopped

Where's your burqa? Why are you

Stop it. Stop it.

I don't think
I can go on like this.

Too bad.
I could use some help.

I should have helped.

I need a helper because this tray
is too heavy. Will you help?

00:33:11,638 --> 00:33:13,972
- That's not really a name.
- It means "fire."

465
00:33:13,974 --> 00:33:17,708
I know what it means,
but it's still not a name.

466
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,811
Then it suits me fine.

467
00:33:19,813 --> 00:33:21,415
I'll call you
Aatish then.

468
00:33:22,548 --> 00:33:25,617
When you're a boy you can
go anywhere you like,

469
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:27,420
Aatish Khan.

470
00:33:35,829 --> 00:33:37,561
Where are we going?

471
00:33:37,563 --> 00:33:39,300
You'll see.

472
00:33:54,848 --> 00:33:56,880
What if someone
sees us?

473
00:33:56,882 --> 00:33:59,350
I usually just pretend
I work here.

474
00:33:59,352 --> 00:34:01,589
If you look like you believe
it, then they will too.

475
00:34:02,855 --> 00:34:04,758
See? We're cleaners.

476
00:34:37,023 --> 00:34:38,990
What are you
waiting for?

477
00:34:38,992 --> 00:34:41,392
It's either ours,
or the mice eat it.

478
00:34:41,394 --> 00:34:43,794
I need to find a way
to see my Baba.

479
00:34:43,796 --> 00:34:46,597
You can have mine if you like.
I don't want him.

480
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:50,434
My father was taken to prison and
we've heard nothing of him since.

481
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:53,004
- They won't let you see him, Parvana.
- But I'm a boy now.

482
00:34:53,006 --> 00:34:56,740
Doesn't make a difference. They'll keep him or
let him go, but there's nothing you can do.

483
00:34:56,742 --> 00:34:58,943
You don't know that.

484
00:34:58,945 --> 00:35:02,416
I'm sorry.
It's just the way it is.

485
00:35:04,851 --> 00:35:09,687
There might be a way, but
you'll need lots of money.

486
00:35:09,689 --> 00:35:11,622
What for?

487
00:35:11,624 --> 00:35:14,829
You can get a lot done
with bribes. A lot.

488
00:35:19,432 --> 00:35:21,802
[Parvana] Anything written.
Anything read.

489
00:35:23,403 --> 00:35:25,403
Pashto and Dari.

490
00:35:25,405 --> 00:35:27,408
Wonderful items
for sale.

491
00:35:28,407 --> 00:35:30,908
Anything written!
Anything read!

492
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:33,410
Anything written!
Anything read!

493
00:35:33,412 --> 00:35:35,650
What happened to the man
who used to sit here?

494
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:39,017
It is a simple question.

495
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:40,852
Don't you know?

496
00:35:40,854 --> 00:35:43,787
How should I know? Answer the question.
Where is he?

497
00:35:43,789 --> 00:35:46,957
- He left for Mazar-e-Sharif.
- And what are you to him?

498
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:51,465
I'm his nephew,
uh... Aatish.

499
00:35:53,499 --> 00:35:55,399
Do you know
how to read?

500
00:35:55,401 --> 00:35:59,439
- Do you have something to read? I read Pashto and Dari.
- Read this.

501
00:36:02,675 --> 00:36:04,711
Let's see
if you're any good.

502
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,716
[sighs]

503
00:36:11,418 --> 00:36:13,787
Come on. Take it out
of the envelope.

504
00:36:16,122 --> 00:36:17,722
"Dear Razaq..."

505
00:36:17,724 --> 00:36:20,725
Louder, or I will have to
take my business elsewhere.

506
00:36:20,727 --> 00:36:24,129
"Dear Razaq, I hope this
letter reaches you in Kabul.

507
00:36:24,131 --> 00:36:27,131
I'm writing to you
with sad news.

508
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:32,372
I am sorry to tell you that Hala Begum
died on the way to her sister's wedding.

509
00:36:33,606 --> 00:36:37,041
The bus she was traveling on
hit a land mine.

510
00:36:37,043 --> 00:36:39,477
Her injuries
were too great to bear

511
00:36:39,479 --> 00:36:41,845
and she died
some hours afterward.

512
00:36:41,847 --> 00:36:44,481
I know this must be
a great shock to you,

513
00:36:44,483 --> 00:36:46,818
but please know that when
I last spoke to Hala,

514
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,523
she told me of your
kindness toward her.

515
00:36:51,023 --> 00:36:53,124
May Allah bless you now,

516
00:36:53,126 --> 00:36:55,763
guide your path,
and give you courage."

517
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:00,867
I'm sorry.

518
00:37:06,907 --> 00:37:09,410
[sighs]

519
00:37:33,499 --> 00:37:36,501
[mother] Ah, there's
my sweet little girl

520
00:37:36,503 --> 00:37:38,202
underneath
all the dust of Kabul.

521
00:37:38,204 --> 00:37:39,937
[Zaki fussing]

522
00:37:39,939 --> 00:37:42,539
[Soraya] Parvana,
what did you give Zaki?

523
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:44,809
- It's a piece of candy.
- A piece?

524
00:37:44,811 --> 00:37:47,010
Oh!

525
00:37:47,012 --> 00:37:49,481
It's big enough
to choke him!

526
00:37:49,483 --> 00:37:52,216
Let him be, Soraya.
You're spoiling his fun.

527
00:37:52,218 --> 00:37:53,917
[fussing continues]

528
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:55,220
Ow!

529
00:37:55,222 --> 00:37:58,122
[mother] Continue
the story, Parvana.

530
00:37:58,124 --> 00:38:00,258
- For Zaki.
- [Zaki exclaims]

531
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,693
[Parvana]
There was this young boy,

532
00:38:02,695 --> 00:38:07,265
and he promised his people
to find the precious seeds.

533
00:38:07,267 --> 00:38:09,501
Elephant?
Elephant?

534
00:38:09,503 --> 00:38:12,604
Yes,
and the elephant.

535
00:38:12,606 --> 00:38:15,874
At night, the boy walked
through the pine trees

536
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,912
on his way to the mountain
to face the Elephant King.

537
00:38:25,852 --> 00:38:28,720
<i>Something was following him
in the darkness,</i>

538
00:38:28,722 --> 00:38:31,725
<i>but he was too terrified
to turn around and face it.</i>

539
00:38:33,093 --> 00:38:34,725
<i>He began to run,</i>

540
00:38:34,727 --> 00:38:36,930
<i>and the thing
that chased him also ran.</i>

541
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:42,870
<i>The boy ran faster
and so did his pursuer.</i>

542
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,702
<i>He ran into the night,</i>

543
00:38:45,704 --> 00:38:49,543
<i>chased by the unknown demons
until he could run no more.</i>

544
00:38:50,142 --> 00:38:52,010
<i>He tumbled down a hill.</i>

545
00:38:52,012 --> 00:38:53,948
- [screaming]
- <i>Down.</i>

546
00:38:55,081 --> 00:38:57,148
<i>Down.</i>

547
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,751
<i>Down.</i>

548
00:39:03,322 --> 00:39:05,058
[sighs]

549
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:18,202
[mother] <i>Dear Cousin, it has been
many years since we have spoken,</i>

550
00:39:18,204 --> 00:39:23,106
<i>but I am writing to you now to tell
you that my husband has been arrested</i>

551
00:39:23,108 --> 00:39:27,081
<i>and we have no word on when
he will be released, if at all.</i>

552
00:39:28,914 --> 00:39:32,686
<i>My family is in a desperate
situation and I need your help.</i>

553
00:39:33,653 --> 00:39:35,620
<i>My eldest daughter
is now of age,</i>

554
00:39:35,622 --> 00:39:40,561
<i>and I am asking that you consider her as
a bride for your youngest son, Ajmal.</i>

555
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,729
<i>Please take us out of Kabul</i>

556
00:39:44,731 --> 00:39:47,932
<i>so that we may have
a chance of survival.</i>

557
00:39:47,934 --> 00:39:50,334
<i>We will not be
a burden to you.</i>

558
00:39:50,336 --> 00:39:52,236
<i>We are skilled and strong</i>

559
00:39:52,238 --> 00:39:55,006
<i>and need little
by the way of means.</i>

<i>May the blessings of Allah
be upon you. Fattema.</i>

How much
for the dress?

565
00:40:11,791 --> 00:40:13,224
Salaam. It's handmade.

566
00:40:13,226 --> 00:40:15,392
- How much?
- 3,000.

567
00:40:15,394 --> 00:40:18,062
Don't be stupid.
I'll give you 300.

568
00:40:18,064 --> 00:40:19,696
2,000.

569
00:40:19,698 --> 00:40:21,633
Handmade
in Mazar-e-Sharif.

570
00:40:21,635 --> 00:40:25,639
Your daughter will be very happy
to wear such a beautiful dress.

571
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,742
She is my wife.

572
00:40:30,376 --> 00:40:32,109
1,500.

573
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:33,847
See how it sparkles?

574
00:40:35,215 --> 00:40:37,718
Here's 1,000.

575
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,859
- How much did you make?
- A thousand.

576
00:40:48,861 --> 00:40:51,428
That might be enough
for a good bribe.

577
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:53,664
- Really?
- Definitely.

578
00:40:53,666 --> 00:40:57,401
I'm saving up too. Whatever money I
can hide from my father, I keep.

579
00:40:57,403 --> 00:41:00,608
And it's mounting up
to a nice little sum.

580
00:41:01,206 --> 00:41:03,006
See?

581
00:41:03,008 --> 00:41:05,776
I'm not going to stay
here forever, you know.

582
00:41:05,778 --> 00:41:08,745
- Have you ever been to the sea?
- No.

583
00:41:08,747 --> 00:41:09,946
Neither have I.

584
00:41:09,948 --> 00:41:14,352
But I've heard that the moon
pulls the water onto the shore

585
00:41:14,354 --> 00:41:16,287
and then
back out again.

586
00:41:16,289 --> 00:41:17,854
I want to see that.

587
00:41:17,856 --> 00:41:22,827
I want to put my feet on the warm sand and
have them cooled by the lapping water.

588
00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:27,164
What about your father?
Doesn't he depend on you?

589
00:41:27,166 --> 00:41:28,768
I am a good son.

590
00:41:29,769 --> 00:41:31,772
But he is not
a good father.

591
00:41:33,907 --> 00:41:36,274
- What will you do by the sea?
- [chuckles]

592
00:41:36,276 --> 00:41:41,312
I'd buy things and sell things,
like I do here, but for myself.

593
00:41:41,314 --> 00:41:45,416
There are people who go to the
edge of the water to do nothing.

594
00:41:45,418 --> 00:41:48,820
They just sit there and they look
at the sea with their sunglasses on

595
00:41:48,822 --> 00:41:50,921
or swim about
on floating tubes.

596
00:41:50,923 --> 00:41:53,890
So I could sell them
those things.

597
00:41:53,892 --> 00:41:56,894
Hmm. That sounds nice, Deliwar.

598
00:41:56,896 --> 00:41:59,062
And maybe
I'll join you.

599
00:41:59,064 --> 00:42:01,235
- Where are you going?
- Wish me luck.

600
00:42:08,842 --> 00:42:12,410
- Why are you back so early?
- I have brought some bread and raisins for Zaki.

601
00:42:12,412 --> 00:42:14,211
What are you doing,
Parvana?

602
00:42:14,213 --> 00:42:15,812
I'm going to find Baba.

603
00:42:15,814 --> 00:42:17,481
- No, you're not.
- I'm going.

604
00:42:17,483 --> 00:42:19,517
You won't make it home
before curfew.

605
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,885
I'm going. There's nothing
you can do to stop me.

606
00:42:21,887 --> 00:42:25,323
Mama-jan has been through enough
without you doing something so stupid.

607
00:42:25,325 --> 00:42:27,425
- I have to find him.
- Parvana!

608
00:42:27,427 --> 00:42:29,162
Parvana!

609
00:42:30,229 --> 00:42:31,298

Excuse me.

Salaam. Hello!

- [banging on door]
- Excuse me!

- What do you want?
- [gasps]

615
00:43:43,302 --> 00:43:46,102
- I said, what do you want?
- I want to see my father.

616
00:43:46,104 --> 00:43:49,039
- Who?
- My father, Nurullah Alizai.

617
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:50,975
Brought here two weeks ago
without charge.

618
00:43:50,977 --> 00:43:53,910
- Get out of here.
- I have money... 1,000 afghani.

619
00:43:53,912 --> 00:43:56,914
- I can give it to you if you promise to help.
- Hey, what are you doing?

620
00:43:56,916 --> 00:43:59,550
Nothing.
Just getting rid of a kid.

621
00:43:59,552 --> 00:44:01,619
Please! Open up!

622
00:44:01,621 --> 00:44:04,454
I have to see my father!
I have to see him!

623
00:44:04,456 --> 00:44:06,957
[screams, groans]

624
00:44:06,959 --> 00:44:09,829
Now get out of here
unless you want some more.

625
00:44:10,396 --> 00:44:12,396
[door slams]

They say it doesn't always
rain the way it thunders.

630
00:44:55,974 --> 00:45:00,577
Last we heard of him,
the boy had fallen down.

631
00:45:00,579 --> 00:45:05,983
He had fallen down the hill
and into the deepest of sleeps.

632
00:45:05,985 --> 00:45:09,287
But all was not lost.

633
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:13,390
He was discovered
by an old woman.

634
00:45:13,392 --> 00:45:14,994
She had a drum.

635
00:45:16,528 --> 00:45:21,365
[Fattema] <i>A magic drum
that beat so beautifully</i>

636
00:45:21,367 --> 00:45:23,600
<i>that his heart woke up.</i>

637
00:45:23,602 --> 00:45:27,441

[gasps]

639
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:38,448
<i>She knew he must be on a
quest, and so she asked him...</i>

640
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:40,984
What is it you seek?

641
00:45:40,986 --> 00:45:44,555
Well, you see, the dreadful Elephant
King sent his jaguars to steal the...

642
00:45:44,557 --> 00:45:47,024
[cackling]

643
00:45:47,026 --> 00:45:50,428
No one has ever overcome
the Elephant King.

644
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:54,034
- I know.
- Well, what makes you think you can?

645
00:45:54,566 --> 00:45:56,033
I need to.

646
00:45:56,035 --> 00:45:57,635
I just need to,
that's all.

647
00:45:57,637 --> 00:46:00,537
That's not
a very good answer.

648
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:05,111
[Fattema] <i>Nevertheless, the woman told
him he'd need to find three things...</i>

649
00:46:06,713 --> 00:46:09,379
<i>something that shines,</i>

650
00:46:09,381 --> 00:46:11,716
<i>something that ensnares,</i>

651
00:46:11,718 --> 00:46:14,050
<i>and something that soothes.</i>

652
00:46:14,052 --> 00:46:18,155
<i>Only then would he overcome
the Elephant King.</i>

653
00:46:18,157 --> 00:46:20,057
Give them to me,
please!

654
00:46:20,059 --> 00:46:22,059
[chuckles]
I don't have them,

655
00:46:22,061 --> 00:46:24,028
so you'd better
go look for them.

656
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:29,600
And hurry! If the seeds are not planted
soon, there will be no harvest.

657
00:46:29,602 --> 00:46:31,102
Yes, I know.

658
00:46:31,104 --> 00:46:33,470
[Fattema]
<i>She told him to head east.</i>

659
00:46:33,472 --> 00:46:36,409
East is the other way.

660
00:46:37,543 --> 00:46:40,745
[Fattema] <i>Still something
followed the boy,</i>

661
00:46:40,747 --> 00:46:44,151
<i>and still
he could not face it.</i>

662
00:47:03,769 --> 00:47:07,171
- He didn't take the money?
- I don't think bribes work on them.

663
00:47:07,173 --> 00:47:10,774
[sighs] No, no.
It probably wasn't enough.

664
00:47:10,776 --> 00:47:12,709
It might have
insulted him.

665
00:47:12,711 --> 00:47:16,247
You'll just have to save up more
and be even smarter next time.

666
00:47:16,249 --> 00:47:19,682
- Aaah!
- <i>I</i> have to be smarter?

667
00:47:19,684 --> 00:47:23,387
I've heard there is a guy who
pays well for small jobs.

668
00:47:23,389 --> 00:47:25,388
Come on.

669
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:27,691
[Shauzia]
Sir, we have come to work.

670
00:47:27,693 --> 00:47:30,827
- And you are?
- I'm Deliwar. And this is Aatish.

671
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:32,629
We are brothers.

672
00:47:32,631 --> 00:47:35,066
What kind of a name
is Aatish?

673
00:47:35,068 --> 00:47:36,700
[Shauzia] I don't know.
Ask our father.

674
00:47:36,702 --> 00:47:40,407
- Where is your father?
- He was martyred by the Russians.

675
00:47:41,273 --> 00:47:43,207
We can do
any job you want.

676
00:47:43,209 --> 00:47:44,578
For the right price.

677
00:47:46,845 --> 00:47:48,481
[grunts]

678
00:47:56,822 --> 00:47:59,122
[exhales] That's the
last one, I think.

679
00:47:59,124 --> 00:48:00,825
Where are we anyway?

680
00:48:00,827 --> 00:48:03,794
About time. You boys
are not very strong.

681
00:48:03,796 --> 00:48:05,729
It was more work
than you said.

682
00:48:05,731 --> 00:48:07,798
Here you are.
Now be off.

683
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,334
Hey, we did all
that you asked.

684
00:48:10,336 --> 00:48:13,169
Wait! You said
you'd drive us back.

685
00:48:13,171 --> 00:48:15,305
I'm not a taxi.
Make your own way home.

686
00:48:15,307 --> 00:48:18,809
I'm late already because you
took so long to load the truck.

687
00:48:18,811 --> 00:48:20,579
Wait!

688
00:48:38,264 --> 00:48:40,330
I need to rest
a moment.

689
00:48:40,332 --> 00:48:43,336
Stay on the path.
This place might be mined.

690
00:49:05,557 --> 00:49:08,559
This is not nearly enough.
We need better jobs.

691
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:11,662
- Like what?
- I heard brick making pays well.

692
00:49:11,664 --> 00:49:13,600
But it's hard work.

693
00:49:15,334 --> 00:49:17,501
I wish I was stronger.

694
00:49:17,503 --> 00:49:19,702
But you have an older
brother, don't you?

695
00:49:19,704 --> 00:49:22,273
He used to bring you to
school on his shoulders.

696
00:49:22,275 --> 00:49:25,175
What's his name?

697
00:49:25,177 --> 00:49:26,612
Sulayman.

698
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:31,182
He died.

699
00:49:31,184 --> 00:49:33,684
How?
Was it the sickness?

700
00:49:33,686 --> 00:49:36,352
- I don't know.
- But your mother must have told you.

701
00:49:36,354 --> 00:49:38,525
She doesn't speak of it.
All right?

702
00:49:40,892 --> 00:49:42,528
All right.

703
00:49:45,697 --> 00:49:48,666
Hey, look
what I've got.

704
00:49:48,668 --> 00:49:52,669
I found it in a little box where
my father keeps his things.

705
00:49:52,671 --> 00:49:55,905
Can you believe
the water is that blue?

706
00:49:55,907 --> 00:49:57,710
It's very nice.

707
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:08,551
[Parvana] Anything written!
Anything read!

708
00:50:08,553 --> 00:50:11,821
Anything written!
Anything read!

709
00:50:11,823 --> 00:50:14,494
Anything written!
Anything read!

710
00:50:15,461 --> 00:50:17,461
I didn't pay you
last time.

711
00:50:17,463 --> 00:50:20,296
- How much do I owe you?
- It's okay. I...

712
00:50:20,298 --> 00:50:22,535
What, you don't charge
for bad news?

713
00:50:25,704 --> 00:50:27,671
[groans]

714
00:50:27,673 --> 00:50:30,274
Who taught you to read?
The crippled teacher?

715
00:50:30,276 --> 00:50:32,008
Yes. My uncle.

716
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:34,477
Can you write
as good as you read?

717
00:50:34,479 --> 00:50:35,748
I can.

718
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:39,318
Here.

719
00:50:41,887 --> 00:50:44,457
I kept this
in case you wanted it.

720
00:50:45,557 --> 00:50:47,992
Show me. Show me
where it says her name.

721
00:50:47,994 --> 00:50:50,463
Where it says
"Hala."

722
00:50:52,564 --> 00:50:54,367
There. See?

723
00:50:55,034 --> 00:50:56,669
Hala.

724
00:51:14,452 --> 00:51:16,820
Do you know
what it means?

725
00:51:16,822 --> 00:51:18,490
No.

726
00:51:19,724 --> 00:51:23,626
Sometimes, on a clear night
when you look at the moon,

727
00:51:23,628 --> 00:51:26,298
you can see a bright
outline around it.

728
00:51:27,532 --> 00:51:30,934
That outline
is called hala.

729
00:51:30,936 --> 00:51:34,374
My wife was named
for that light.

730
00:51:43,548 --> 00:51:45,349
- Here.
- This is too much.

731
00:51:45,351 --> 00:51:47,584
Don't argue with me.

732
00:51:47,586 --> 00:51:48,822
Thank you.

733
00:51:57,595 --> 00:52:00,396
- [babbling]
- [laughing]

734
00:52:00,398 --> 00:52:04,068
Stop it, Zaki.
Can I pull yours?

735
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:06,102
[babbling]

736
00:52:06,104 --> 00:52:08,939
[Soraya] Keep him quiet.
I'm trying to sleep.

737
00:52:08,941 --> 00:52:12,843
- What's the matter with you?
- Why don't you tell Zaki a story, hmm?

738
00:52:12,845 --> 00:52:14,544
We'd all like that.

739
00:52:14,546 --> 00:52:17,914
Well, Zaki, do you want to know
what happened to the boy?

740
00:52:17,916 --> 00:52:19,615
[babbling]

741
00:52:19,617 --> 00:52:21,885
Yes, yes,
and the elephant.

742
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:23,454
[Zaki squeals]

743
00:52:23,456 --> 00:52:27,758
The boy ran and ran, his
heart beating fast in fear.

744
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,928
<i>And the thing that chased him
never stopped.</i>

745

[roaring]

746
00:52:33,698 --> 00:52:37,503
<i>So the boy hid behind a tree
and he waited for courage.</i>

00:52:42,073 --> 00:52:44,874
[grunting]

748
00:52:44,876 --> 00:52:48,111
<i>An ancient woman
had been trying to milk a goat,</i>

749
00:52:48,113 --> 00:52:50,546
<i>but her back was very sore.</i>

750
00:52:50,548 --> 00:52:55,986
My back is very sore.

751
00:52:55,988 --> 00:53:00,624
<i>The boy took pity on her and told her
to rest under the shade of a tree</i>

752

<i>and he would do
the milking instead.</i>

753
00:53:02,695 --> 00:53:04,794
Please sit under
the shade of this tree,

754
00:53:04,796 --> 00:53:07,467
and I will do
the milking instead.

755

<i>When he finished
milking the goat,</i>

756
00:53:16,742 --> 00:53:19,843
<i>the old woman shared
the lovely, warm milk with him.</i>

00:53:19,845 --> 00:53:23,814
- [slurping]
- <i>It was the nicest milk he had ever tasted,</i>

758
00:53:23,816 --> 00:53:26,483
<i>and he complimented the woman
on her goats.</i>

759
00:53:26,485 --> 00:53:28,684
Your goats
are very generous.

760
00:53:28,686 --> 00:53:31,921
<i>In return, the old woman
gave him a mirror.</i>

761
00:53:31,923 --> 00:53:36,126
See how it shines!

762
00:53:36,128 --> 00:53:38,629
<i>The boy was delighted
with the mirror,</i>

763
00:53:38,631 --> 00:53:43,737
<i>but as he looked into it, he saw the
reflection of the thing that followed him!</i>

764
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:49,705
What are you doing,
Mama-jan?

765
00:53:49,707 --> 00:53:52,508
I'm laying out
Soraya's good clothes.

766
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:54,845
Am I to sell them
at the market?

767
00:53:54,847 --> 00:53:57,851
Shh, shh, shh, Parvana.
It's time to sleep.

768
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:09,626
[Shauzia] I just need to find
a way to get to Peshawar,

769
00:54:09,628 --> 00:54:11,762
and I can figure it out
from there.

770
00:54:11,764 --> 00:54:14,164
I think there's
a beach in Goa

771
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:16,533
where the tourists
are very rich.

772
00:54:16,535 --> 00:54:18,734
If they're rich, they
would buy my blue stones,

773
00:54:18,736 --> 00:54:22,071
and that's where I'd set up my
business, and you could join me.

774
00:54:22,073 --> 00:54:24,207
Once I find Baba.

775
00:54:24,209 --> 00:54:26,545
Once you find your Baba.

776
00:54:27,613 --> 00:54:29,948
[aircraft approaching]

777
00:54:45,798 --> 00:54:47,097
100.

778
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:48,599
I'll give you 85.

779
00:54:48,601 --> 00:54:49,832
- Ninety.
- Eighty-two.

780
00:54:49,834 --> 00:54:51,834
Eighty-five,
and that's final.

781
00:54:51,836 --> 00:54:54,474
Eighty-five and a bunch of
grapes, and that's final.

782
00:54:59,244 --> 00:55:03,713
You're leaning too hard on the
pen, but your writing is good.

783
00:55:03,715 --> 00:55:06,485
If you try it more gently,
it'll be easier.

784
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:14,660
[chirping]

785
00:55:22,101 --> 00:55:25,037
[people chattering]

786
00:55:43,289 --> 00:55:45,658
Wait!
Wait a moment!

787
00:55:47,293 --> 00:55:49,158
What is it, child?

788
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:52,863
You asked me before about the man who
used to sit there... the teacher.

789
00:55:52,865 --> 00:55:55,999
- Your uncle?
- He didn't go to Mazar-e-Sharif.

790
00:55:56,001 --> 00:55:59,169
He was taken to prison.
But he did nothing wrong.

791
00:55:59,171 --> 00:56:00,736
- Which one?
- What?

792
00:56:00,738 --> 00:56:03,039
- Which prison?
- Pul-e-Charkhi.

793
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:06,578
It's been weeks now, and my
family has had no word of him.

794
00:56:08,646 --> 00:56:10,613
Go to the prison
on Wednesday.

795
00:56:10,615 --> 00:56:12,282
Ask for Roshan.
He's my cousin.

796
00:56:12,284 --> 00:56:15,854
Tell him Razaq sent you and
he will help you, if he can.

797
00:56:38,811 --> 00:56:41,613
[sighs]

798
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,680
Deliwar!

799
00:56:43,682 --> 00:56:49,186
With work like this, I'll be an old
woman by the time I get to the sea.

800
00:56:49,188 --> 00:56:52,021
Or an old man.

801
00:56:52,023 --> 00:56:53,892
[groans]

802
00:56:57,229 --> 00:57:01,330
You sit and rest, Deliwar,
and I'll tell you a story.

803
00:57:01,332 --> 00:57:04,604
- A story?
- Yes, a story.

804
00:57:05,704 --> 00:57:07,269
One time
in the deep past,

805
00:57:07,271 --> 00:57:11,841
there was a boy who had to return a stolen
bag of precious seeds to his village.

806
00:57:11,843 --> 00:57:15,278
Is it a happy story
or a sad story?

807
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,584
Just wait and see.

808
00:57:18,916 --> 00:57:21,952
The boy had been told
he needed three things

809
00:57:21,954 --> 00:57:25,122
in order to overcome
the Elephant King...

810
00:57:25,124 --> 00:57:28,992
something that shines, something
that ensnares and something that...

811
00:57:28,994 --> 00:57:31,863
[man]
Hey, you two! Come here!

812
00:57:33,231 --> 00:57:35,064
Come on!

813
00:57:35,066 --> 00:57:36,666
I know that boy.

814
00:57:36,668 --> 00:57:39,202
Hurry up. Come here.

815
00:57:39,204 --> 00:57:40,836
Come on.

816
00:57:40,838 --> 00:57:43,642
We'd better do
what we're told.

817
00:57:46,744 --> 00:57:48,780
Get a move on,
lazy kids.

818
00:57:53,285 --> 00:57:56,122
[laughing]

819
00:57:56,988 --> 00:57:59,021
So these are
the new workers?

820
00:57:59,023 --> 00:58:01,892
- [men laughing]
- Where are your tongues? Are you stupid?

821
00:58:01,894 --> 00:58:05,095
Idrees suggested we have a
little arm-wrestling match.

822
00:58:05,097 --> 00:58:06,095
[laughing continues]

823
00:58:06,097 --> 00:58:09,198
To see if you're strong
enough to work for me.

824
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,834
I saw you sitting down
over there instead of working.

825
00:58:11,836 --> 00:58:13,836
- [gasps]
- Idrees, stop now.

826
00:58:13,838 --> 00:58:15,805
Make me some tea.
[laughing]

827
00:58:15,807 --> 00:58:18,110
[grunting, gasps]

828
00:58:19,778 --> 00:58:22,713
Let me see how feeble
<i>you</i> are, little one.

829
00:58:22,715 --> 00:58:23,979
[grunting]

830
00:58:23,981 --> 00:58:26,251
He can't even
lift his hand.

831
00:58:27,885 --> 00:58:30,188
Get up and make us tea.

832
00:58:31,456 --> 00:58:34,925
Uncle, I think
you need new workers.

833
00:58:34,927 --> 00:58:37,794
- These ones are no good.
- Enough, Idrees.

834
00:58:37,796 --> 00:58:39,428
Leave the poor kids alone.

835
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:41,934
They are
a little undercooked.

836
00:58:45,771 --> 00:58:48,070
I know you.

837
00:58:48,072 --> 00:58:50,275
- You're the teacher's daugh...
- [grunts]

838
00:58:51,209 --> 00:58:53,945
[men laughing]

839
00:58:55,747 --> 00:58:57,881
- [angry shout]
- Idrees.

840
00:58:57,883 --> 00:58:59,883
Bring the gun back!

841
00:58:59,885 --> 00:59:01,917
I said
bring the gun back!

842
00:59:01,919 --> 00:59:04,823
- [angry shout]
- Idrees!

843
00:59:23,242 --> 00:59:25,041
Come out now!

844
00:59:25,043 --> 00:59:27,280
[grunting]

845
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,412
Come out now!

846
00:59:30,414 --> 00:59:33,719
[kiln owner] Idrees, it has begun!
We are moving west.

847
00:59:34,787 --> 00:59:37,553
We have been given orders
to go immediately!

848
00:59:37,555 --> 00:59:39,789
I know who you are!

849
00:59:39,791 --> 00:59:41,293
Do you hear?

850
00:59:42,394 --> 00:59:44,494
Get up here! Come on!

851
00:59:44,496 --> 00:59:46,229
[gasping, panting]

852
00:59:46,231 --> 00:59:48,868
[kiln owner] Right now!
You little coward!

853
00:59:50,903 --> 00:59:54,874
You want to fight? Now
is your chance to fight!

854
00:59:56,842 --> 00:59:58,244
You become a man.

855
01:00:17,428 --> 01:00:19,331
[wind whistling]

856
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,499
[Shauzia] He's gone.

857
01:00:23,501 --> 01:00:25,568
[Parvana]
What if he comes back?

858
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:27,870
[Shauzia chuckles]
He'd be lucky.

859
01:00:27,872 --> 01:00:29,439
Where are we?

860
01:00:29,441 --> 01:00:31,841
I came here once
when I ran away.

861
01:00:31,843 --> 01:00:35,914
I think the way in has gotten
smaller or I have gotten bigger.

862
01:00:36,615 --> 01:00:38,383
It looks old.

863
01:00:39,284 --> 01:00:40,950
I lost a shoe.

864
01:00:40,952 --> 01:00:44,454
I lost my cap, although
I think it's outside.

865
01:00:44,456 --> 01:00:46,291
Why did you hit him?

866
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:51,363
When they took my father,
he was one of them.

867
01:00:53,497 --> 01:00:55,231
Tell me more
about the boy.

868
01:00:55,233 --> 01:00:56,932
What boy?

869
01:00:56,934 --> 01:00:58,901
The story boy.

870
01:00:58,903 --> 01:01:01,637
The boy was cold.

871
01:01:01,639 --> 01:01:05,242
<i>Though the sun burned in
the sky, it gave no heat.</i>

872
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:08,245
[Shauzia] <i>But he had a
warm hat and a big coat.</i>

873
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:09,979
<i>No, he didn't.</i>

874
01:01:09,981 --> 01:01:12,448
<i>He had already found
one of the three things...</i>

875
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:14,350
<i>a mirror that shone.</i>

876
01:01:14,352 --> 01:01:17,988
<i>But when he looked at it,
he saw something behind him.</i>

877
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:20,657
<i>Something scary.
Something dreadful!</i>

878
01:01:20,659 --> 01:01:23,626
- <i>A horse!</i>
- <i>No, Shauzia, not a horse.</i>

879
01:01:23,628 --> 01:01:25,528
- [chuckling]
- <i>Yes, it was.</i>

880
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:29,131
<i>And it was a very old horse whose bones
clattered together when it walked.</i>

881
01:01:29,133 --> 01:01:32,369
- <i>It wasn't scary at all.</i>
- [sighs]

882
01:01:32,371 --> 01:01:36,673
<i>Fine. The boy felt sad for the
old horse and fed him hay.</i>

883
01:01:36,675 --> 01:01:38,642
<i>And they all lived
happily ever after.</i>

884
01:01:38,644 --> 01:01:41,378
<i>It's the middle of the
story, not the end!</i>

885
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:44,146
<i>From a door carved
into the stone,</i>

886
01:01:44,148 --> 01:01:46,448
- <i>out came a round man.</i>
- [grunts]

887
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:50,519
You wasted my hay on an old
horse that will soon be dead!

888
01:01:50,521 --> 01:01:53,622
<i>The round man threw the boy deep
into the belly of an ancient well.</i>

889
01:01:53,624 --> 01:01:56,228
Aaah!

890
01:01:57,496 --> 01:02:00,129
<i>At the bottom of the well
there were emeralds,</i>

891
01:02:00,131 --> 01:02:04,200
<i>and the round man wanted them brought up
to him as payment for the wasted hay.</i>

892
01:02:04,202 --> 01:02:06,568
You will bring
the emeralds to me.

893
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:08,604
- <i>What's his name?</i>
- <i>The round man?</i>

894
01:02:08,606 --> 01:02:10,372
No, the boy.

895
01:02:10,374 --> 01:02:13,609
You can't have a story about a
boy and not give him a name.

896
01:02:13,611 --> 01:02:15,544
Give him a name
before I do.

897
01:02:15,546 --> 01:02:17,414
Sulayman.

898
01:02:17,416 --> 01:02:19,919
His name is Sulayman.

899
01:02:20,552 --> 01:02:22,385
That's a good name.

900
01:02:22,387 --> 01:02:25,354
Sulayman lay
at the bottom of the well.

901
01:02:25,356 --> 01:02:28,457
- <i>Suddenly, he could see skeletons.</i>
- [growling]

902
01:02:28,459 --> 01:02:33,296
<i>Three skeletons, each with an
emerald clutched in its bony hands.</i>

903
01:02:33,298 --> 01:02:35,131
- <i>He called out for help.</i>
- Help!

904
01:02:35,133 --> 01:02:38,267
<i>The poor old horse looked
back at him from way above.</i>

905
01:02:38,269 --> 01:02:41,171
<i>But the horse did
something extraordinary.</i>

906
01:02:41,173 --> 01:02:44,106
<i>He neighed with the voice
of all the world's animals.</i>

907
01:02:44,108 --> 01:02:48,280
[neighing ferociously]

908
01:02:53,751 --> 01:02:57,053
<i>Sulayman climbed up, up,
all the way to the top,</i>

909
01:02:57,055 --> 01:02:59,421
<i>and he thanked the horse
for saving his life.</i>

910
01:02:59,423 --> 01:03:02,260
- Thank you for saving my life.
- [murmuring]

911
01:03:07,131 --> 01:03:09,599
<i>Sulayman had just
three emeralds with him...</i>

912
01:03:09,601 --> 01:03:12,602
- [laughing]
- <i>And asked the round man for food in return.</i>

913
01:03:12,604 --> 01:03:14,336
<i>He was hungry.</i>

914
01:03:14,338 --> 01:03:16,606
<i>But the round man
was wicked and cheap.</i>

915
01:03:16,608 --> 01:03:20,477
<i>He threw a fishing net at Sulayman
and he told him to get his own food.</i>

916
01:03:20,479 --> 01:03:23,747
- <i>That was exactly what Sulayman needed.</i>
- Ha-ha!

917
01:03:23,749 --> 01:03:26,149
<i>Something that ensnares.</i>

918
01:03:26,151 --> 01:03:27,751
<i>But as Sulayman left,</i>

919
01:03:27,753 --> 01:03:31,488
<i>the ghosts of the three skeletons
came out of the three emeralds</i>

920
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:34,457
<i>and swirled and twirled
and scared the round man</i>

921
01:03:34,459 --> 01:03:37,760
<i>in frightful vengeance for
having lost them their lives.</i>

922
01:03:37,762 --> 01:03:40,131
[screaming]

923
01:03:42,034 --> 01:03:45,667
<i>Sulayman and the horse continued
their journey toward the mountain,</i>

924
01:03:45,669 --> 01:03:49,171
<i>but the horse was getting
slower and slower.</i>

925
01:03:49,173 --> 01:03:52,541
<i>He needed to rest,
being very, very old,</i>

926
01:03:52,543 --> 01:03:55,445
<i>and so Sulayman made a
shelter for the horse</i>

927
01:03:55,447 --> 01:03:58,148
<i>and told him
to wait for him.</i>

928
01:03:58,150 --> 01:04:00,517
- <i>The horse protested...</i>
- [whinnies]

929
01:04:00,519 --> 01:04:04,454
<i>but Sulayman knew he had to face
the Elephant King and the jaguars</i>

930
01:04:04,456 --> 01:04:06,088
<i>all by himself.</i>

931
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:08,126
I will see you again,
old horse.

932
01:04:10,327 --> 01:04:12,398
<i>And so on he went alone.</i>

933
01:04:24,809 --> 01:04:27,142
Tomorrow is Wednesday.

934
01:04:27,144 --> 01:04:30,148
I'm going back there,
to the prison.

935
01:04:31,749 --> 01:04:34,085
They'll have to
let me see him then.

936
01:04:55,273 --> 01:04:57,307
From now on,
you're staying inside.

937
01:04:57,309 --> 01:04:59,575
- It's much too dangerous.
- No, Mama-jan.

938
01:04:59,577 --> 01:05:01,778
- We manage all right out there.
- "We"?

939
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:05,715
Me and Deliwar. She's a girl too.
We work together.

940
01:05:05,717 --> 01:05:09,452
We've written to my cousin to arrange
a marriage for your sister in Mazar.

941
01:05:09,454 --> 01:05:11,588
They wrote back,
and it was accepted.

942
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:14,457
Someone will come for us the day
after tomorrow to take us away.

943
01:05:14,459 --> 01:05:16,358
- You don't need to do this anymore.
- What?

944
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,361
We can't go on
like this.

945
01:05:18,363 --> 01:05:20,863
- We can't depend on you to keep us alive.
- Why?

946
01:05:20,865 --> 01:05:22,731
I provide for you
just fine.

947
01:05:22,733 --> 01:05:24,901
It's not the job of a child.

948
01:05:24,903 --> 01:05:27,437
How can we leave
without Baba?

949
01:05:27,439 --> 01:05:29,905
Every day you come home
with cuts and blisters.

950
01:05:29,907 --> 01:05:33,611
Every day you go out there, and I don't
know if I'll see you back again.

951
01:05:34,746 --> 01:05:36,745
I can't lose you too.

952
01:05:36,747 --> 01:05:38,747
I'm not going.

953
01:05:38,749 --> 01:05:41,818
Baba could come back, and no one
will be here waiting for him.

954
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:44,254
So how long
should we wait?

955
01:05:44,256 --> 01:05:46,689
Until you're found out
and taken away from me?

956
01:05:46,691 --> 01:05:48,925
Until I have to send Zaki out
to earn our keep?

957
01:05:48,927 --> 01:05:51,227
Let me go see him
before we leave.

958
01:05:51,229 --> 01:05:53,428
Let me tell him
where we are going.

959
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:55,832
- Parvana!
- Let me bring him his walking stick.

960
01:05:55,834 --> 01:05:57,566
Then I will go with you.

961
01:05:57,568 --> 01:06:01,504
Then I will be a good sister
and a good daughter.

962
01:06:01,506 --> 01:06:03,109
I promise.

963
01:06:03,909 --> 01:06:05,510
I promise.

964
01:06:08,313 --> 01:06:11,117
[jets passing overhead]

965
01:06:20,592 --> 01:06:22,258
Please don't go.

966
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:24,827
Please, it is much
too dangerous now.

967
01:06:24,829 --> 01:06:27,396
Mama-jan, I'm going.

968
01:06:27,398 --> 01:06:29,265
I'll be back tonight
before curfew.

969
01:06:29,267 --> 01:06:31,800
- No, Sulayman.
- Mama-jan.

970
01:06:31,802 --> 01:06:35,271
- You won't come back.
- Let her go now.

971
01:06:35,273 --> 01:06:37,409
Let Parvana go.

972
01:06:40,811 --> 01:06:43,515
[babbles]

973
01:06:44,615 --> 01:06:46,552
Oh! [babbles]

974
01:06:53,457 --> 01:06:55,561
Parvana.

975
01:07:28,927 --> 01:07:30,595
[gasps]

976
01:07:31,595 --> 01:07:33,231
Deliwar!

977
01:07:34,666 --> 01:07:37,600
[laughs] You frightened
me half to death.

978
01:07:37,602 --> 01:07:39,602
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

979
01:07:39,604 --> 01:07:42,537
Why? You want to work at the
chai shop with me this morning?

980
01:07:42,539 --> 01:07:46,441
- No, I can't.
- Hey, you want some candy for Zaki?

981
01:07:46,443 --> 01:07:49,280
We are leaving Kabul
tomorrow.

982
01:07:50,881 --> 01:07:52,749
You are leaving me?

983
01:07:52,751 --> 01:07:55,885
It's been arranged.
There's nothing I can do.

984
01:07:55,887 --> 01:08:00,023
My sister is getting
married in Mazar-e-Sharif.

985
01:08:00,025 --> 01:08:01,624
I'm going back
to the prison.

986
01:08:01,626 --> 01:08:03,626
I found someone
who can help me,

987
01:08:03,628 --> 01:08:05,861
and I need to get more money
to bribe the guard.

988
01:08:05,863 --> 01:08:07,763
I'll need it today.

989
01:08:07,765 --> 01:08:10,932
You'll just get another punch in the guts.
It's a stupid idea.

990
01:08:10,934 --> 01:08:12,769
I won't let that happen
this time.

991
01:08:12,771 --> 01:08:15,905
- I said it's a stupid idea.
- Please help me.

992
01:08:15,907 --> 01:08:17,774
What do you want me to do?

993
01:08:17,776 --> 01:08:21,043
Magic some money into your hand
like in your kids' stories?

994
01:08:21,045 --> 01:08:23,745
It doesn't work like that,
Parvana.

995
01:08:23,747 --> 01:08:25,715
I can't help you.

996
01:08:25,717 --> 01:08:29,819
Now run away to Mazar-e-Sharif
and have a nice wedding party.

997
01:08:29,821 --> 01:08:33,922
Maybe they'll find a husband for you
too and your troubles will be over.

998
01:08:33,924 --> 01:08:36,359
Until after the wedding,
at least.

999
01:08:36,361 --> 01:08:37,796
You fool!

1000
01:08:40,932 --> 01:08:42,601
Deliwar!

1001
01:08:43,668 --> 01:08:45,304
Shauzia.

1002
01:08:53,812 --> 01:08:55,944
Shauzia.

1003
01:08:55,946 --> 01:08:57,879
Come with us.

1004
01:08:57,881 --> 01:09:00,416
I can't.

1005
01:09:00,418 --> 01:09:03,554
My father would come all the
way to Mazar to kill me.

1006
01:09:05,423 --> 01:09:08,427
I can't leave Kabul,
Parvana, not like this.

1007
01:09:10,628 --> 01:09:13,363
- Here, take this.
- I can't take your money.

1008
01:09:13,365 --> 01:09:15,334
Please take it.

1009
01:09:18,436 --> 01:09:20,837
Go and see your Baba.

1010
01:09:20,839 --> 01:09:24,907
Tell him that his daughter
is a good daughter.

1011
01:09:24,909 --> 01:09:28,580
Tell him
that Deliwar said so.

1012
01:09:34,853 --> 01:09:37,587
Hey, Deliwar.

1013
01:09:37,589 --> 01:09:39,721
What?

1014
01:09:39,723 --> 01:09:42,458
I'll meet you at that beach
you were talking about,

1015
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:45,127
where the moon
pulls the water,

1016
01:09:45,129 --> 01:09:47,029
20 years from today.

1017
01:09:47,031 --> 01:09:50,166
[chuckles] I don't think I'll
recognize you then, Aatish.

1018
01:09:50,168 --> 01:09:54,372
Well, you can sell me some pretty
blue stones for a great price.

1019
01:09:56,407 --> 01:09:58,477
Until next time then.

1020
01:10:01,478 --> 01:10:03,745
Until next time.

1021
01:10:03,747 --> 01:10:06,485
[jets approaching]

1022
01:10:12,756 --> 01:10:14,759
[knocking]

1023
01:10:21,799 --> 01:10:24,033
Peace be upon you.
Are you Fattema?

1024
01:10:24,035 --> 01:10:25,234
Yes, I am Fattema.

1025
01:10:25,236 --> 01:10:28,503
I am your second cousin. Mohammed
Abdul sent me from Mazar.

1026
01:10:28,505 --> 01:10:30,873
Gather your family.
We must leave immediately.

1027
01:10:30,875 --> 01:10:34,644
No, you see, you weren't
supposed to come so soon.

1028
01:10:34,646 --> 01:10:37,180
My son is away. We must
wait for him to return.

1029
01:10:37,182 --> 01:10:38,948
There is a war coming.
Have you not heard?

1030
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:41,050
We have to leave now
before they block the roads.

1031
01:10:41,052 --> 01:10:43,819
We have to wait until she comes home.
I have to wait for my daughter.

1032
01:10:43,821 --> 01:10:46,122
[angry grunt]
Son? Daughter? Which is it?

1033
01:10:46,124 --> 01:10:47,989
Gather your things.
We are leaving now!

1034
01:10:47,991 --> 01:10:50,892
I'm not leaving without Parvana.
We have to wait.

1035
01:10:50,894 --> 01:10:52,895
Count yourself lucky
I'm taking you, old woman.

1036
01:10:52,897 --> 01:10:54,896
The girl and the baby
are of more worth.

1037
01:10:54,898 --> 01:10:56,798
I didn't come all this way
for nothing.

1038
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,235
If we do not go now, we won't
get out of here at all.

1039
01:10:59,237 --> 01:11:01,770
- My baby! Give him to me!
- Let's go! Argh!

1040
01:11:01,772 --> 01:11:03,674
- Zaki! Zaki!
- [Zaki screaming]

1041
01:11:04,709 --> 01:11:07,243
Give me my baby.
Give him to me!

1042
01:11:07,245 --> 01:11:09,415
- No! Give him to me!
- Let go! Let go!

1043
01:11:20,825 --> 01:11:22,594
[engine idling]

1044
01:11:24,562 --> 01:11:26,828
- Salaam, little one.
- Salaam.

1045
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:30,132
Where are you going to
with an old man's stick?

1046
01:11:30,134 --> 01:11:32,735
It belongs to my Baba.

1047
01:11:32,737 --> 01:11:35,707
I'm taking it to him,
to the prison.

1048
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,477
I see.

1049
01:11:39,244 --> 01:11:41,479
We're going that way.

1050
01:11:48,652 --> 01:11:50,285
- [Zaki crying]
- Give me my baby!

1051
01:11:50,287 --> 01:11:53,823
- Let's go! If you want to keep the baby, come with me!
- Zaki!

1052
01:11:53,825 --> 01:11:55,858
My daughter
is out there.

1053
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:58,261
Then what kind of fool are you
to have sent her out alone?

1054
01:11:58,263 --> 01:12:01,163
Get in, or she won't be the
only child you'll lose today!

1055
01:12:01,165 --> 01:12:03,966
Don't...
Give me my baby!

1056
01:12:03,968 --> 01:12:05,868
Keep him quiet!

1057
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:07,837
I am begging you.

1058
01:12:07,839 --> 01:12:12,744
- [engine cranking]
- Wait for my daughter!

1059
01:12:54,117 --> 01:12:55,987
[shouting
in Afghan language]

1060
01:12:59,957 --> 01:13:03,191
Come, Soraya.
We must start a fire.

1061
01:13:03,193 --> 01:13:04,993
- [men shouting]
- [knocking]

1062
01:13:04,995 --> 01:13:06,796
I am looking for Roshan.

1063
01:13:06,798 --> 01:13:09,131
Hey!
I am looking for Roshan.

1064
01:13:09,133 --> 01:13:12,601
I am looking for Roshan.
I am looking for Roshan.

1065
01:13:12,603 --> 01:13:15,837
I am looking for Roshan.
I am looking for Roshan.

1066
01:13:15,839 --> 01:13:18,039
- Open the door!
- Get away from the door, you stupid kid!

1067
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:20,309
- I am looking for Roshan!
- Get out of here!

1068
01:13:20,311 --> 01:13:22,278
- I am looking for Roshan!
- Are you stupid?

1069
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:23,878
- I am looking for Roshan.
- Shut up!

1070
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:25,247
- What are you doing here?
- [gasps]

1071
01:13:25,249 --> 01:13:28,184
It's all right.
He's my son.

1072
01:13:28,186 --> 01:13:30,688
You're wanted inside.

1073
01:13:32,389 --> 01:13:34,323
That boy needs
some discipline.

1074
01:13:34,325 --> 01:13:36,128
That's my business.

1075
01:13:39,097 --> 01:13:42,898
What in the name of the
merciful are you doing here?

1076
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:46,368
It's Wednesday. I've come
to meet your cousin Roshan.

1077
01:13:46,370 --> 01:13:49,638
[scoffs]
There's a war started.

1078
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,774
Roshan has gone to fight.

1079
