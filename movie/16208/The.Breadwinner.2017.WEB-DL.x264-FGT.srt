7
00:01:56,931 --> 00:02:00,667
I saw you serve a woman!
I saw you with my own eyes!

8
00:02:00,669 --> 00:02:02,369
- Uh, I really don't think...
- You were!

9
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:03,869
Anything written.
Anything read.

10

11
00:02:07,743 --> 00:02:09,545
Parvana.

12
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:13,613
It's the only thing
of value we have left.

13
00:02:13,615 --> 00:02:17,550
I never wore it.
Not even once.

14
00:02:17,552 --> 00:02:19,985
Where would you wear it,
Parvana?

15
00:02:19,987 --> 00:02:23,690
- Let's continue your studies. All right?
- Yes, Baba.

16
00:02:23,692 --> 00:02:28,829
Now, what can you tell me
about the Silk Road?

17
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:30,566
The Silk Road.

18
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,338
Baba, I can't remember
about the Silk Road.

19
00:02:36,137 --> 00:02:38,938
Maybe if we think of it
like a story.

20
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,709
Stories remain in our hearts
even when all else is gone.

21
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:46,545
Our people have always told
stories, from our very beginning,

22
00:02:46,547 --> 00:02:48,784
when we were Parthia
and Khorasan.

23
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:55,454
<i>A fractured land in the
claws of the Hindu Kush mountains,</i>

24
00:02:55,456 --> 00:02:59,658
<i>scorched by the fiery eyes
of the Northern Deserts,</i>

25
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,696
<i>black rubble earth
against ice peaks.</i>

26
00:03:02,698 --> 00:03:06,736
<i>Our land was the petrified
skeleton of a monster.</i>

27
00:03:07,802 --> 00:03:09,468
<i>We were</i> Ariana,

28
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,940
<i>the land of the noble
and honorable.</i>

29
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:16,143
<i>We were a pathway
to everywhere,</i>

30
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:18,814
<i>carrying goods
from east to west.</i>

31
00:03:20,015 --> 00:03:21,680
<i>We studied the stars</i>

32
00:03:21,682 --> 00:03:24,884
<i>and began to see order
amidst the chaos.</i>

33
00:03:24,886 --> 00:03:28,954
<i>We were scientists,
philosophers, and storytellers.</i>

34
00:03:28,956 --> 00:03:32,626
<i>Questions sought answers
and then more questions.</i>

35
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:36,128
<i>We began to see our place
in the universe.</i>

36
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,833
<i>But we were at the edges of
empires at war with each other,</i>

37
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:42,668
<i>as borders were defined
and redefined...</i>

38
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,640
<i>over thousands of years.</i>

39
00:03:46,874 --> 00:03:50,746
<i>Of these mighty rulers
came Cyrus the Great of Persia.</i>

40
00:03:52,647 --> 00:03:55,550
<i>Then Alexander the Great
of Macedon.</i>

41
00:03:56,184 --> 00:03:58,884
<i>There came the Mauryan Empire,</i>

42
00:03:58,886 --> 00:04:00,821
<i>Genghis Khan,</i>

43
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,190
<i>and so on and so on.</i>

44
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:05,758
<i>Each time
there was bloodshed,</i>

45
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,963
<i>and each time
there were survivors.</i>

46
00:04:09,063 --> 00:04:11,566
<i>A pattern repeating itself
endlessly.</i>

47
00:04:15,136 --> 00:04:16,902
<i>When I was young, Parvana,</i>

48
00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:20,907
<i>I knew what peace felt like,
here in this city.</i>

49
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:25,078
<i>Children went to school,
women went to university.</i>

50
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,881
<i>All the empires
forgot about us,</i>

51
00:04:27,883 --> 00:04:29,082
<i>for a while at least.</i>

52
00:04:30,686 --> 00:04:32,686
<i>But it did not last.</i>

53
00:04:32,688 --> 00:04:35,554
<i>The ground became weak
under our feet,</i>

54
00:04:35,556 --> 00:04:37,890
<i>always uncertain.</i>

55
00:04:37,892 --> 00:04:41,126
<i>First came a coup d'état,
then an invasion,</i>

56
00:04:41,128 --> 00:04:42,831
<i>then a civil war.</i>

57
00:04:43,998 --> 00:04:45,564
<i>In the chaos,</i>

58
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:48,703
<i>some looked to those
who might restore order.</i>

59
00:04:50,072 --> 00:04:51,737
<i>But at a great cost.</i>

60
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:55,107
We have determined
specific dignity for women!

61
00:04:55,109 --> 00:04:59,212
Women should not go outside and
attract unnecessary attention!

62
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:03,749
If a woman shows herself, she will
be cursed by the Islamic Sharia

63
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:06,152
and should never expect
to go to heaven.

64
00:05:06,154 --> 00:05:08,722
Everything changes,
Parvana.

65
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:10,827
Stories remind us of that.

66
00:05:14,762 --> 00:05:17,864
Parvana, were you
listening at all?

67
00:05:17,866 --> 00:05:19,131
Yes, Baba.

68
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:23,003
Why don't you tell me
about our nomadic ancestors

69
00:05:23,005 --> 00:05:25,541
and their hills of gold?

70
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:27,907
Well?

71
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:29,678
2,000 years ago...

72
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:33,748
- Yes?
- 2,000 years ago...

73
00:05:34,782 --> 00:05:37,883
<i>there was a Bactrian princess</i>

74
00:05:37,885 --> 00:05:40,320
<i>who had a crown.</i>

75
00:05:40,322 --> 00:05:42,289
<i>And?</i>

76
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,157
- <i>And...</i>
- <i>Parvana?</i>

77
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,626
Away.
Keep away from my things.

78
00:05:46,628 --> 00:05:49,895
Go away. I said go
away, you silly dog!

79
00:05:49,897 --> 00:05:52,832
Hey, you! What do you
think you're doing?

80
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:54,099
Why is this girl
shouting?

81
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:56,335
She is only a child.
She meant nothing by it.

82
00:05:56,337 --> 00:05:58,104
She's drawing attention
to herself!

83
00:05:58,106 --> 00:06:00,674
She should be at home, not
displaying herself in the market.

84
00:06:00,676 --> 00:06:04,010
I have no son at home, except an infant.
I need my daughter to help me.

85
00:06:04,012 --> 00:06:05,679
- Stand up when we talk to you.
- I am a cr...

86
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:06,983
I said stand up!

87
00:06:13,722 --> 00:06:15,854
- I know you.
- Yes, Idrees.

88
00:06:15,856 --> 00:06:18,090
I was your teacher once.
You were a good student.

89
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:20,994
You wasted my time, teaching
me things of no worth.

90
00:06:20,996 --> 00:06:24,631
I have joined the Taliban and now
I fight the enemies of Islam.

91
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:29,201
Well, if I am an enemy, then for
my sins God has taken my leg.

92
00:06:29,203 --> 00:06:31,071
Are you making fun of me,
old man?

93
00:06:31,073 --> 00:06:34,708
I lost my leg in the war.
The war we fought together.

94
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,876
- How old is the girl?
- Idrees.

95
00:06:36,878 --> 00:06:38,845
- She is a child.
- She's old enough to marry.

96
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,679
I'll be looking
for a wife soon.

97
00:06:40,681 --> 00:06:42,681
She's already been promised
to someone.

98
00:06:42,683 --> 00:06:44,383
Well, she should
cover herself properly.

99
00:06:44,385 --> 00:06:46,785
- Maybe you should stop looking at her.
- What did you say to me?

100
00:06:46,787 --> 00:06:48,955
I said
stop looking at her.

101
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:50,823
- I can have you killed!
- Idrees.

102
00:06:50,825 --> 00:06:53,025
- You watch what you say!
- That's enough. Come on.

103
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:57,364
Are you all right?

104
00:06:57,366 --> 00:06:59,198
Yes, Baba.

105
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,736
That's my girl.

106
00:07:01,236 --> 00:07:02,837
Let's go home now.

107
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,956
Parvana?

108
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:24,224
You told that boy
I was promised to someone.

109
00:07:24,226 --> 00:07:26,059
Am I getting married?

110
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:28,861
Of course not.
You are still a child.

111
00:07:28,863 --> 00:07:31,263
I want you playing
and telling stories.

112
00:07:31,265 --> 00:07:33,133
I'm too old for that now.

113
00:07:33,135 --> 00:07:36,236
Too old for stories?
You've always loved stories.

114
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:38,174
What's the use?

115
00:07:50,152 --> 00:07:52,986
I'll have a word with Mama-jan
and we'll sort it all out.

116
00:07:52,988 --> 00:07:54,720
Please don't mention
the dress.

117
00:07:59,995 --> 00:08:02,895
Then I'll never
hear the end of it.

118
00:08:02,897 --> 00:08:05,231
- The end of what?
- Nothing, Mama-jan.

119
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:07,866
We're not selling
Parvana's good dress.

120
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:10,369
Baba, that's not
what I meant.

121
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:12,438
We need the money,
Baba.

122
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,241
We'll hold off for a bit. I
think business will pick up.

123
00:08:16,243 --> 00:08:19,311
If business picks up, then we
won't have to sell it, sure.

124
00:08:19,313 --> 00:08:23,117
But the sky is far and the earth is hard.
We will have to sell it soon.

125
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:25,184
Well, what about a little story
before dinner?

126
00:08:25,186 --> 00:08:28,787
And we'll forget all about
dresses for a while.

127
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:31,357
Maybe Parvana would like
to read something for us?

128
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:34,060
Not right now, Mama-jan.
I'm tired.

129
00:08:34,062 --> 00:08:36,930
She's not a child
anymore, she tells me.

130
00:08:36,932 --> 00:08:39,199
So she doesn't
like stories.

131
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:42,801
Don't be in such a hurry
to grow up, my sweet girl.

132
00:08:42,803 --> 00:08:45,171
It might not be
all that you expect.

133
00:08:45,173 --> 00:08:48,441
We're out of water. You didn't
bring enough this morning.

134
00:08:48,443 --> 00:08:50,375
But there's half a bucket
by the door.

135
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:54,480
When I was young enough to fetch
water, the buckets were never empty.

136
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:56,349
- Hey!
- Girls, stop it.

137
00:08:56,351 --> 00:08:59,418
Either you go out and get more water after dinner...

138
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,921
or you can wash
Zaki's dirty diapers.

139
00:09:01,923 --> 00:09:04,456
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

140
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,925
Now that you're here.

141
00:09:05,927 --> 00:09:11,064
Maybe if you didn't wash your hair so
much, we wouldn't run out so quickly.

142
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:13,999
- Parvana.
- You should have some respect.

143
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:16,802
Why don't you eat,
hmm?

144
00:09:16,804 --> 00:09:21,043
- Things always look better when your belly is full.
- Yes, Maudar.

145
00:09:31,986 --> 00:09:34,387
Zaki, Zaki, wait till I
pull up your sleeves.

146
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:35,989
No, Mama-jan.

147
00:09:35,991 --> 00:09:38,992
There. There you go.

148
00:09:38,994 --> 00:09:43,128
Don't eat all the raisins, Parvana.
Leave them for Zaki.

149
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,465
Why don't you give him that big
raisin on your chin, Soraya?

150
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:48,835
Oh, but it's
not a raisin.

151
00:09:48,837 --> 00:09:50,939
It's a big,
hairy mole.

152
00:09:51,807 --> 00:09:54,342
Parvana,
apologize to Soraya.

153
00:09:58,145 --> 00:09:59,781
Parvana?

154
00:10:05,886 --> 00:10:08,153
He's in there! I saw him!

155
00:10:08,155 --> 00:10:09,922
- If there are women present...
- Baba?

156
00:10:09,924 --> 00:10:11,794
Cover yourselves now!

157
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:16,128
That's the man.
An enemy of Islam.

158
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,398
He's got forbidden books, and he's
teaching the women with them!

159
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,301
- Leave us be!
- He's done nothing!

160
00:10:21,303 --> 00:10:26,205
Nurullah Alizai, you must come with us.

161
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:27,574
Baba!

162
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:30,143
- You can't take him!
- Baba!

163
00:10:30,145 --> 00:10:32,277
Baba-jan!

164
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:36,215
Where is he being taken?

165
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:38,218
To prison.

166
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,123
They'll teach him a good lesson
in Pul-e-Charkhi.

167
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:44,224
Baba!

168
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,892
Baba!

169
00:11:07,515 --> 00:11:11,484
Mama-jan?
Can I light the lamp?

170
00:11:11,486 --> 00:11:14,921
Hush, Parvana.
You'll wake Zaki.

171
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:16,889
But if they
let Baba go,

172
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:19,658
he'll need a light in
the window to see home.

173
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,198
How could he come home? He doesn't
even have his stick to walk with.

174
00:11:25,634 --> 00:11:28,368
Go back to sleep.
It will be all right.

175
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,370
How do you know that, Mama-jan?
How do you know?

176
00:11:31,372 --> 00:11:35,044
Be quiet, Parvana. She has
enough to worry about.

177
00:11:46,453 --> 00:11:48,388
Hey!
Zaki, stop it.

178
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:51,990
Get up, Parvana.
Stop playing around.

179
00:11:51,992 --> 00:11:53,558
Why?
What's going on?

180
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,228
You and I
are going to find Baba.

181
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:59,132
The boy said he was being taken to Pul-e-Charkhi
prison, so that's where we are going.

182
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:01,033
But we can't go outside
without Baba.

183
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:03,136
Soraya is writing a letter
for the prison governor

184
00:12:03,138 --> 00:12:05,504
to protest Nurullah's arrest
and ask for his release.

185
00:12:05,506 --> 00:12:08,474
- At least I can give them that.
- Mama-jan, it's not allowed.

186
00:12:08,476 --> 00:12:11,677
We might be all right if we don't
draw attention to ourselves.

187
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:13,479
- But we can't...
- Come on, Parvana.

188
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:16,284
And bring Baba's walking stick.
We have to get going.

189
00:12:26,294 --> 00:12:28,029
Mama.

190
00:12:48,382 --> 00:12:50,248
Hey.

191
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,187
Hey, you!

192
00:12:54,555 --> 00:12:57,356
Salaam. Can you tell me
the way to Pul-e-Charkhi?

193
00:12:57,358 --> 00:13:01,661
Salaam. Uh, it's east,
past the river.

194
00:13:01,663 --> 00:13:04,162
- But it's a long way.
- Thank you, sir.

195
00:13:04,164 --> 00:13:07,403
Listen. Go through the old
town, or you'll be caught.

196
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,190
Why are you out here by yourself?

197
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:33,125
- Where is your husband?
- I have no choice.

198
00:13:33,127 --> 00:13:36,061
It's not permitted to be out here
without your husband or your brother.

199
00:13:36,063 --> 00:13:38,096
- I'm sorry. I know.
- Do you understand?

200
00:13:38,098 --> 00:13:41,167
- I am bringing a letter protesting my husband's arrest...
- Just go home.

201
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:42,667
- No!
- What do you mean, "no"?

202
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:44,402
This is Nurullah Alizai,
my husband.

203
00:13:44,404 --> 00:13:47,105
- He was arrested last night with no charges laid against him.
- Photographs are forbidden!

204
00:13:47,107 --> 00:13:50,542
- I have no one at home...
- What are you doing, showing me a photograph?

205
00:13:50,544 --> 00:13:54,047
- Out here by yourself. Go home!
- There is no one in my house except for children.

206
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:58,453
You have no business out here. Do you
understand? Go home. Immediately.

207
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:01,557
You're looking
for trouble now!

208
00:14:10,631 --> 00:14:13,266
You are an insult to your
husband, to your race!

209
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:15,401
I need to find out
what happened to him!

210
00:14:15,403 --> 00:14:19,074
Shut up!

211
00:14:33,454 --> 00:14:36,455
Going to the prison
will change nothing.

212
00:14:36,457 --> 00:14:39,258
If you make trouble like this,

213
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,128
your husband will be punished
severely for your insolence.

214
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,068
And if I find you out here again
by yourself, I will arrest you.

215
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:49,303
Now go.

216
00:14:55,476 --> 00:14:57,343
Mama-jan?

217
00:14:57,345 --> 00:14:59,314
Take me home.

218
00:16:05,746 --> 00:16:07,446
- More!
- Shh.

219
00:16:07,448 --> 00:16:10,248
Go get water, Parvana.
We have none left.

220
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,621
Come on.

221
00:16:41,915 --> 00:16:44,218
Get out!

222
00:16:45,352 --> 00:16:47,555
What are you up to?

223
00:16:48,555 --> 00:16:50,558
Get out of here.
They'll see you!

224
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,258
Hey, stop!

225
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,630
Stop when I tell you!

226
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:02,538
Through here!

227
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:06,272
Stop!

228
00:17:06,274 --> 00:17:07,872
Where did
that boy go?

229
00:17:07,874 --> 00:17:09,577
Did you see?
Did you see?

230
00:17:11,478 --> 00:17:13,446
- Hey, you! Girl!
- Hey!

231
00:17:13,448 --> 00:17:15,583
- Come on!
- Forget about her!

232
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:22,955
Parvana, this is
only half a bucket.

233
00:17:22,957 --> 00:17:24,823
Couldn't you fill them up
all the way?

234
00:17:24,825 --> 00:17:28,494
Zaki, shh. Don't wake her.

235
00:17:28,496 --> 00:17:31,796
- Hush, Zaki.
- Mama-jan!

236
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:33,733
- Shh.
- Sooth him, Parvana.

237
00:17:33,735 --> 00:17:35,400
Mama-jan.

238
00:17:35,402 --> 00:17:36,936
Tell him a story.

239
00:17:36,938 --> 00:17:38,571
Mama...

240
00:17:38,573 --> 00:17:41,307
One time
in the distant past,

241
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:44,909
there was a little village at the
foot of the Hindu Kush mountains.

242
00:17:44,911 --> 00:17:47,812
- I want Mama-jan.
- Shh. Listen.

243
00:17:47,814 --> 00:17:52,284
The villagers had just managed
to gather precious seeds.

244
00:17:52,286 --> 00:17:56,688
And so, there was dancing and
singing and laughing and eating.

245
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,890
Everyone was happy.

246
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:00,892
<i>Especially for one boy</i>

247
00:18:00,894 --> 00:18:04,929
<i>who danced and sang and laughed
and ate more than anyone else.</i>

248
00:18:20,081 --> 00:18:24,716
<i>While the villagers were dancing and
singing and laughing and eating,</i>

249
00:18:24,718 --> 00:18:25,853
<i>monsters were coming.</i>

250
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,631
<i>The monsters frightened the
donkeys and ate the trees.</i>

251
00:18:40,802 --> 00:18:43,869
<i>They stole the most precious
thing in the whole village...</i>

252
00:18:45,505 --> 00:18:47,342
<i>the seeds
for next year's crop.</i>

253
00:18:50,812 --> 00:18:54,612
<i>Then they ran back to the Hindu Kush
mountains where their master lay...</i>

254
00:18:54,614 --> 00:18:58,484
<i>the dreadful Elephant King
with spikes for tusks.</i>

255
00:18:58,486 --> 00:19:01,853
<i>Grrrroar!</i>

256
00:19:01,855 --> 00:19:05,523
Grroar! Grroar!

257
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:07,827
Grroar!

258
00:19:09,697 --> 00:19:11,332
Mama-jan.

259
00:19:39,861 --> 00:19:44,466
Please eat, Mama-jan. You'll feel
better when your belly is full.

260
00:20:03,418 --> 00:20:06,418
There's hardly
any food left.

261
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,622
I'll go
to the market.

262
00:20:19,766 --> 00:20:22,437
- Salaam.
- Salaam. Twelve oranges, please.

263
00:20:23,036 --> 00:20:24,639
100 afghani.

264
00:20:25,806 --> 00:20:27,375
Thank you.

265
00:20:29,709 --> 00:20:33,212
Salaam. How much
for six apples, please?

266
00:20:33,214 --> 00:20:35,613
Salaam, child.
I can't serve you.

267
00:20:35,615 --> 00:20:37,949
But, sir, can I please
have six apples?

268
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:41,719
- Get your father to buy food for you.
- My father has been taken.

269
00:20:41,721 --> 00:20:43,924
I'm sorry.
Maybe come back later.

270
00:21:07,648 --> 00:21:09,782
Literally stolen.
But you know...

271
00:21:09,784 --> 00:21:13,455
Salaam. Can I have
a kilo of rice, please?

272
00:21:15,022 --> 00:21:17,156
- Salaam.
- Hey, you!

273
00:21:17,158 --> 00:21:19,023
Girl!

274
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:20,461
Hey, stop!

275
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:25,000
Stop when I tell you!

276
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,443
Go! Go home!

277
00:21:38,246 --> 00:21:39,778
I dropped the bag.

278
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,546
- Hush.
- I lost the money.

279
00:21:41,548 --> 00:21:43,749
- Keep your head back.
- I can get the water though.

280
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:45,821
Don't worry
about that now.

281
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,853
I saved you
a piece of naan.

282
00:21:48,855 --> 00:21:52,493
I'll heat it up for you so it's
nice and fresh. All right?

283
00:22:13,747 --> 00:22:16,749
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know.

284
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:19,984
Maybe if I go out early,
before it's crowded.

285
00:22:19,986 --> 00:22:21,753
It won't work,
Parvana.

286
00:22:21,755 --> 00:22:25,291
Market sellers won't risk getting
in trouble for serving you.

287
00:22:25,293 --> 00:22:27,892
Mama-jan has cousins
in Mazar-e-Sharif.

288
00:22:27,894 --> 00:22:29,994
I could write to them
for help.

289
00:22:29,996 --> 00:22:34,567
But we've never even met them.
How do you know they will help?

290
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:36,037
We need food now.

291
00:24:21,842 --> 00:24:23,775
These were
your brother's clothes.

292
00:24:23,777 --> 00:24:26,981
They will be big,
but we can take them up a bit.

293
00:24:28,381 --> 00:24:31,215
Do I look like
a boy?

294
00:24:31,217 --> 00:24:33,952
You look like
Sulayman.

295
00:24:33,954 --> 00:24:36,155
- So much like him.
- Mama-jan.

296
00:24:36,157 --> 00:24:38,756
He was such a good boy.

297
00:24:38,758 --> 00:24:42,026
Not much older
than you are now.

298
00:24:42,028 --> 00:24:43,130
Shh.

299
00:24:44,364 --> 00:24:46,365
It's all right,
Mama-jan.

300
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:49,901
Parvana is going to the
market for food and water.

301
00:24:49,903 --> 00:24:52,906
It's the only way, Mama-Jan.
We have nothing left.

302
00:25:13,226 --> 00:25:16,462
But these juices are warm.
I don't want warm juice.

303
00:25:42,957 --> 00:25:46,058
Yes, that's what I said, but you know...

304
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,359
Salaam. Salaam!

305
00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:50,161
Excuse me. Salaam!

306
00:25:50,163 --> 00:25:52,898
Salaam! Salaam!
Come inside, boy!

307
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,071
I'm not going to deliver, am I?

308
00:25:58,238 --> 00:26:01,042
But you
know how it goes, right?

309
00:26:03,244 --> 00:26:05,310
Well, let's hear it.

310
00:26:05,312 --> 00:26:10,185
I need a kilo of rice, a half kilo of
lentils, and a small amount of raisins.

311
00:26:11,418 --> 00:26:13,051
A small amount?

312
00:26:13,053 --> 00:26:15,419
Should I go
by my imagination?

313
00:26:15,421 --> 00:26:17,121
Yes.

314
00:26:17,123 --> 00:26:20,058
Not very bright, this one.

315
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,396
Poor iron won't make a sharp sword.

316
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:26,965
Look at him smiling!

317
00:26:26,967 --> 00:26:30,468
Little guy doesn't even know
when he's being made fun of.

318
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,006
Thank you.
Thank you very, very much.

319
00:26:54,061 --> 00:26:56,160
You're spilling
the tea.

320
00:26:56,162 --> 00:26:57,832
Sorry, Uncle.

321
00:27:05,171 --> 00:27:07,406
Who are you? Why were
you staring at me?

322
00:27:07,408 --> 00:27:08,907
- What is your name?
- My name?

323
00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:11,275
- I know you from somewhere.
- No... I wasn't...

324
00:27:11,277 --> 00:27:14,378
- Wasn't what?
- You don't know me.

325
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,180
- I do know you.
- No!

326
00:27:16,182 --> 00:27:18,951
- I <i>do</i> know you! You're Parvana!
- I'm not!

327
00:27:18,953 --> 00:27:21,356
I am Shauzia! Remember?
From school?

328
00:27:22,857 --> 00:27:26,058
- Shauzia?
- I had long hair then, but so did you.

329
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,260
- Deliwar.
- Don't tell anyone.

330
00:27:28,262 --> 00:27:29,798
Here's your cap.

331
00:27:31,064 --> 00:27:32,865
You need to get
a boy's name

332
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:35,434
so you don't hesitate
next time somebody asks you.

333
00:27:35,436 --> 00:27:37,301
I am Deliwar now.

334
00:27:37,303 --> 00:27:38,936
It means "brave."

335
00:27:38,938 --> 00:27:41,305
- Where are you?
- I-I have to run.

336
00:27:41,307 --> 00:27:43,410
It was good to see you.

337
00:27:45,144 --> 00:27:46,948
Deliwar.

338
00:27:47,648 --> 00:27:49,615
Mama-jan, please sit down.

339
00:27:49,617 --> 00:27:54,186
- It will be curfew soon. What if she's not back by then?
- She's fine. I'm...

340
00:27:54,188 --> 00:27:55,520
Who's hungry?

341
00:27:55,522 --> 00:27:58,090
Parvana.

342
00:27:58,092 --> 00:28:00,324
Praise Allah. He has
returned you to me.

343
00:28:00,326 --> 00:28:03,896
Mama-jan,
you're squashing the naan.

344
00:28:03,898 --> 00:28:05,967
It smells delicious,
Parvana.

345
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,976
Zaki.

346
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,315
It's me. See?

347
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,986
I bought them
especially for you.

348
00:28:28,988 --> 00:28:31,956
Parvana?

349
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:34,059
If you run out
and get some water,

350
00:28:34,061 --> 00:28:36,261
he'll get used to you
by the time you come back.

351
00:28:36,263 --> 00:28:38,429
- But I'm tired.
- Hurry on, Parvana.

352
00:28:38,431 --> 00:28:40,131
It's almost curfew.

353
00:29:07,995 --> 00:29:10,231
You look
so much like him.

354
00:29:11,098 --> 00:29:12,630
Go change
Sulayman's clothes,

355
00:29:12,632 --> 00:29:14,433
or you'll
get them dirty.

356
00:29:14,435 --> 00:29:16,236
They are already
dirty.

357
00:29:24,143 --> 00:29:26,410
Elephant.

358
00:29:26,412 --> 00:29:28,280
What?

359
00:29:28,282 --> 00:29:31,582
He wants you to continue your
story about the elephant.

360
00:29:31,584 --> 00:29:33,584
Elephant.

361
00:29:33,586 --> 00:29:35,323
Well, um...

362
00:29:36,323 --> 00:29:37,555
in the village,

363
00:29:37,557 --> 00:29:39,992
under the
Hindu Kush mountains,

364
00:29:39,994 --> 00:29:42,530
the poor villagers
cried bitter tears.

365
00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:49,333
<i>They did not know what they would do
without their precious bag of seeds.</i>

366
00:29:49,335 --> 00:29:52,103
<i>They would have nothing
to sow come next spring</i>

367
00:29:52,105 --> 00:29:54,372
<i>and nothing to eat
come next winter.</i>

368
00:29:54,374 --> 00:29:58,209
<i>But the boy,
he did not cry bitter tears.</i>

369
00:29:58,211 --> 00:30:00,411
<i>He looked toward the mountain
and he shouted...</i>

370
00:30:00,413 --> 00:30:02,680
I am not afraid of you,

371
00:30:02,682 --> 00:30:06,385
big, spiky,
bad Elephant King!

372
00:30:12,426 --> 00:30:16,128
<i>Well, maybe he was
a little bit afraid.</i>

373
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:19,697
<i>He told the villagers who had
been weeping bitter tears</i>

374
00:30:19,699 --> 00:30:23,234
<i>that he would get the bag
of seed back before spring.</i>

375
00:30:23,236 --> 00:30:26,103
I will get the bag of
seed back before spring.

376
00:30:26,105 --> 00:30:28,607
<i>But they laughed.</i>

377
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:32,744
<i>They laughed and laughed, because he
was a child and not a great warrior.</i>

378
00:30:32,746 --> 00:30:35,513
<i>Yet the boy
repeated his promise.</i>

379
00:30:35,515 --> 00:30:39,517
I said, I will get the bag
of seed back before spring.

380
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:41,285
<i>And he left the village</i>

381
00:30:41,287 --> 00:30:43,655
<i>to the sound of the Elephant
King's roars ahead of him.</i>

382
00:30:45,592 --> 00:30:47,461
<i>Roar!</i>

383
00:31:17,623 --> 00:31:20,157
Mama-jan,
now that I am a boy

384
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,160
we can go to the
prison and find Baba.

385
00:31:23,162 --> 00:31:25,696
No, Parvana,
we can't do that.

386
00:31:25,698 --> 00:31:27,198
- Why not?
- Shh.

387
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,667
It's not that simple,
Parvana.

388
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:31,535
But we have to try.

389
00:31:31,537 --> 00:31:34,138
- There's nothing we can do.
- That's not true.

390
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,611
Stop it, Parvana.
You're upsetting her.

391
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,654
Hey! Hey! I told you to stop!
Why do you keep running?

392
00:31:49,656 --> 00:31:51,723
You should have stopped
when you were told to.

393
00:31:51,725 --> 00:31:55,327
Where's your burqa? Why are you
dressed like this outside your house?

394
00:31:55,329 --> 00:31:58,830
My husband took my burqa.
I needed to buy medicine.

395
00:31:58,832 --> 00:32:00,599
Stop it. Stop it.

396
00:32:00,601 --> 00:32:03,702
He should be punished for
letting you outside like this!

397
00:32:03,704 --> 00:32:06,404
- Please, please! Please!
- You have to take his punishment!

398
00:32:10,677 --> 00:32:13,347
Stay inside
where you belong!

399
00:32:30,863 --> 00:32:33,601
Deliwar. Deliwar!

400
00:32:35,902 --> 00:32:37,936
Well? Have you remembered
your name yet?

401
00:32:37,938 --> 00:32:40,738
I don't think
I can go on like this.

402
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,676
Too bad.
I could use some help.

403
00:32:47,714 --> 00:32:50,782
- I saw something.
- What do you want me to say?

404
00:32:50,784 --> 00:32:52,283
I should have helped.

405
00:32:52,285 --> 00:32:55,820
- You'd have helped yourself to a good whipping, that's all.
- But I'm not a boy.

406
00:32:55,822 --> 00:32:57,755
You're not a boy,
you're not a girl.

407
00:32:57,757 --> 00:33:01,560
I need a helper because this tray
is too heavy. Will you help?

408
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:05,730
Scratch my nose. Quickly. If I let go
of the tray, the strap will break.

409
00:33:05,732 --> 00:33:07,299
That's better.

410
00:33:07,301 --> 00:33:08,867
- Aatish.
- What?

411
00:33:08,869 --> 00:33:11,636
I remembered my name.
It's Aatish.

412
00:33:11,638 --> 00:33:13,972
- That's not really a name.
- It means "fire."

413
00:33:13,974 --> 00:33:17,708
I know what it means,
but it's still not a name.

414
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,811
Then it suits me fine.

415
00:33:19,813 --> 00:33:21,415
I'll call you
Aatish then.

416
00:33:22,548 --> 00:33:25,617
When you're a boy you can
go anywhere you like,

417
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:27,420
Aatish Khan.

418
00:33:35,829 --> 00:33:37,561
Where are we going?

419
00:33:37,563 --> 00:33:39,300
You'll see.

420
00:33:54,848 --> 00:33:56,880
What if someone
sees us?

421
00:33:56,882 --> 00:33:59,350
I usually just pretend
I work here.

422
00:33:59,352 --> 00:34:01,589
If you look like you believe
it, then they will too.

423
00:34:02,855 --> 00:34:04,758
See? We're cleaners.

424
00:34:37,023 --> 00:34:38,990
What are you
waiting for?

425
00:34:38,992 --> 00:34:41,392
It's either ours,
or the mice eat it.

426
00:34:41,394 --> 00:34:43,794
I need to find a way
to see my Baba.

427
00:34:43,796 --> 00:34:46,597
You can have mine if you like.
I don't want him.

428
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:50,434
My father was taken to prison and
we've heard nothing of him since.

429
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:53,004
- They won't let you see him, Parvana.
- But I'm a boy now.

430
00:34:53,006 --> 00:34:56,740
Doesn't make a difference. They'll keep him or
let him go, but there's nothing you can do.

431
00:34:56,742 --> 00:34:58,943
You don't know that.

432
00:34:58,945 --> 00:35:02,416
I'm sorry.
It's just the way it is.

433
00:35:04,851 --> 00:35:09,687
There might be a way, but
you'll need lots of money.

434
00:35:09,689 --> 00:35:11,622
What for?

435
00:35:11,624 --> 00:35:14,829
You can get a lot done
with bribes. A lot.

436
00:35:19,432 --> 00:35:21,802
Anything written.
Anything read.

437
00:35:23,403 --> 00:35:25,403
Pashto and Dari.

438
00:35:25,405 --> 00:35:27,408
Wonderful items
for sale.

439
00:35:28,407 --> 00:35:30,908
Anything written!
Anything read!

440
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:33,410
Anything written!
Anything read!

441
00:35:33,412 --> 00:35:35,650
What happened to the man
who used to sit here?

442
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:39,017
It is a simple question.

443
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:40,852
Don't you know?

444
00:35:40,854 --> 00:35:43,787
How should I know? Answer the question.
Where is he?

445
00:35:43,789 --> 00:35:46,957
- He left for Mazar-e-Sharif.
- And what are you to him?

446
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:51,465
I'm his nephew,
uh... Aatish.

447
00:35:53,499 --> 00:35:55,399
Do you know
how to read?

448
00:35:55,401 --> 00:35:59,439
- Do you have something to read? I read Pashto and Dari.
- Read this.

449
00:36:02,675 --> 00:36:04,711
Let's see
if you're any good.

450
00:36:11,418 --> 00:36:13,787
Come on. Take it out
of the envelope.

451
00:36:16,122 --> 00:36:17,722
"Dear Razaq..."

452
00:36:17,724 --> 00:36:20,725
Louder, or I will have to
take my business elsewhere.

453
00:36:20,727 --> 00:36:24,129
"Dear Razaq, I hope this
letter reaches you in Kabul.

454
00:36:24,131 --> 00:36:27,131
I'm writing to you
with sad news.

455
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:32,372
I am sorry to tell you that Hala Begum
died on the way to her sister's wedding.

456
00:36:33,606 --> 00:36:37,041
The bus she was traveling on
hit a land mine.

457
00:36:37,043 --> 00:36:39,477
Her injuries
were too great to bear

458
00:36:39,479 --> 00:36:41,845
and she died
some hours afterward.

459
00:36:41,847 --> 00:36:44,481
I know this must be
a great shock to you,

460
00:36:44,483 --> 00:36:46,818
but please know that when
I last spoke to Hala,

461
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,523
she told me of your
kindness toward her.

462
00:36:51,023 --> 00:36:53,124
May Allah bless you now,

463
00:36:53,126 --> 00:36:55,763
guide your path,
and give you courage."

464
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:00,867
I'm sorry.

465
00:37:33,499 --> 00:37:36,501
Ah, there's
my sweet little girl

466
00:37:36,503 --> 00:37:38,202
underneath
all the dust of Kabul.

467
00:37:39,939 --> 00:37:42,539
Parvana,
what did you give Zaki?

468
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:44,809
- It's a piece of candy.
- A piece?

469
00:37:44,811 --> 00:37:47,010
Oh!

470
00:37:47,012 --> 00:37:49,481
It's big enough
to choke him!

471
00:37:49,483 --> 00:37:52,216
Let him be, Soraya.
You're spoiling his fun.

472
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:55,220
Ow!

473
00:37:55,222 --> 00:37:58,122
Continue
the story, Parvana.

474
00:37:58,124 --> 00:38:00,258
For Zaki.

475
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,693
There was this young boy,

476
00:38:02,695 --> 00:38:07,265
and he promised his people
to find the precious seeds.

477
00:38:07,267 --> 00:38:09,501
Elephant?
Elephant?

478
00:38:09,503 --> 00:38:12,604
Yes,
and the elephant.

479
00:38:12,606 --> 00:38:15,874
At night, the boy walked
through the pine trees

480
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,912
on his way to the mountain
to face the Elephant King.

481
00:38:25,852 --> 00:38:28,720
<i>Something was following him
in the darkness,</i>

482
00:38:28,722 --> 00:38:31,725
<i>but he was too terrified
to turn around and face it.</i>

483
00:38:33,093 --> 00:38:34,725
<i>He began to run,</i>

484
00:38:34,727 --> 00:38:36,930
<i>and the thing
that chased him also ran.</i>

485
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:42,870
<i>The boy ran faster
and so did his pursuer.</i>

486
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,702
<i>He ran into the night,</i>

487
00:38:45,704 --> 00:38:49,543
<i>chased by the unknown demons
until he could run no more.</i>

488
00:38:50,142 --> 00:38:52,010
<i>He tumbled down a hill.</i>

489
00:38:52,012 --> 00:38:53,948
<i>Down.</i>

490
00:38:55,081 --> 00:38:57,148
<i>Down.</i>

491
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,751
<i>Down.</i>

492
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:18,202
<i>Dear Cousin, it has been
many years since we have spoken,</i>

493
00:39:18,204 --> 00:39:23,106
<i>but I am writing to you now to tell
you that my husband has been arrested</i>

494
00:39:23,108 --> 00:39:27,081
<i>and we have no word on when
he will be released, if at all.</i>

495
00:39:28,914 --> 00:39:32,686
<i>My family is in a desperate
situation and I need your help.</i>

496
00:39:33,653 --> 00:39:35,620
<i>My eldest daughter
is now of age,</i>

497
00:39:35,622 --> 00:39:40,561
<i>and I am asking that you consider her as
a bride for your youngest son, Ajmal.</i>

498
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,729
<i>Please take us out of Kabul</i>

499
00:39:44,731 --> 00:39:47,932
<i>so that we may have
a chance of survival.</i>

500
00:39:47,934 --> 00:39:50,334
<i>We will not be
a burden to you.</i>

501
00:39:50,336 --> 00:39:52,236
<i>We are skilled and strong</i>

502
00:39:52,238 --> 00:39:55,006
<i>and need little
by the way of means.</i>

503
00:39:55,008 --> 00:39:58,946
<i>May the blessings of Allah
be upon you. Fattema.</i>

504
00:40:02,314 --> 00:40:05,316
Anything written!
Anything read!

505
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:08,186
Anything written!
Anything read!

506
00:40:08,188 --> 00:40:09,620
Anything written!

507
00:40:09,622 --> 00:40:11,789
How much
for the dress?

508
00:40:11,791 --> 00:40:13,224
Salaam. It's handmade.

509
00:40:13,226 --> 00:40:15,392
- How much?
- 3,000.

510
00:40:15,394 --> 00:40:18,062
Don't be stupid.
I'll give you 300.

511
00:40:18,064 --> 00:40:19,696
2,000.

512
00:40:19,698 --> 00:40:21,633
Handmade
in Mazar-e-Sharif.

513
00:40:21,635 --> 00:40:25,639
Your daughter will be very happy
to wear such a beautiful dress.

514
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,742
She is my wife.

515
00:40:30,376 --> 00:40:32,109
1,500.

516
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:33,847
See how it sparkles?

517
00:40:35,215 --> 00:40:37,718
Here's 1,000.

518
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,859
- How much did you make?
- A thousand.

519
00:40:48,861 --> 00:40:51,428
That might be enough
for a good bribe.

520
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:53,664
- Really?
- Definitely.

521
00:40:53,666 --> 00:40:57,401
I'm saving up too. Whatever money I
can hide from my father, I keep.

522
00:40:57,403 --> 00:41:00,608
And it's mounting up
to a nice little sum.

523
00:41:01,206 --> 00:41:03,006
See?

524
00:41:03,008 --> 00:41:05,776
I'm not going to stay
here forever, you know.

525
00:41:05,778 --> 00:41:08,745
- Have you ever been to the sea?
- No.

526
00:41:08,747 --> 00:41:09,946
Neither have I.

527
00:41:09,948 --> 00:41:14,352
But I've heard that the moon
pulls the water onto the shore

528
00:41:14,354 --> 00:41:16,287
and then
back out again.

529
00:41:16,289 --> 00:41:17,854
I want to see that.

530
00:41:17,856 --> 00:41:22,827
I want to put my feet on the warm sand and
have them cooled by the lapping water.

531
00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:27,164
What about your father?
Doesn't he depend on you?

532
00:41:27,166 --> 00:41:28,768
I am a good son.

533
00:41:29,769 --> 00:41:31,772
But he is not
a good father.

534
00:41:33,907 --> 00:41:36,274
What will you do by the sea?

535
00:41:36,276 --> 00:41:41,312
I'd buy things and sell things,
like I do here, but for myself.

536
00:41:41,314 --> 00:41:45,416
There are people who go to the
edge of the water to do nothing.

537
00:41:45,418 --> 00:41:48,820
They just sit there and they look
at the sea with their sunglasses on

538
00:41:48,822 --> 00:41:50,921
or swim about
on floating tubes.

539
00:41:50,923 --> 00:41:53,890
So I could sell them
those things.

540
00:41:53,892 --> 00:41:56,894
Hmm. That sounds nice, Deliwar.

541
00:41:56,896 --> 00:41:59,062
And maybe
I'll join you.

542
00:41:59,064 --> 00:42:01,235
- Where are you going?
- Wish me luck.

543
00:42:08,842 --> 00:42:12,410
- Why are you back so early?
- I have brought some bread and raisins for Zaki.

544
00:42:12,412 --> 00:42:14,211
What are you doing,
Parvana?

545
00:42:14,213 --> 00:42:15,812
I'm going to find Baba.

546
00:42:15,814 --> 00:42:17,481
- No, you're not.
- I'm going.

547
00:42:17,483 --> 00:42:19,517
You won't make it home
before curfew.

548
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,885
I'm going. There's nothing
you can do to stop me.

549
00:42:21,887 --> 00:42:25,323
Mama-jan has been through enough
without you doing something so stupid.

550
00:42:25,325 --> 00:42:27,425
- I have to find him.
- Parvana!

551
00:42:27,427 --> 00:42:29,162
Parvana!

552
00:42:30,229 --> 00:42:31,298
Parvana!

553
00:43:35,093 --> 00:43:36,494
Excuse me.

554
00:43:36,496 --> 00:43:38,995
Salaam. Hello!

555
00:43:38,997 --> 00:43:40,965
Excuse me!

556
00:43:40,967 --> 00:43:43,300
What do you want?

557
00:43:43,302 --> 00:43:46,102
- I said, what do you want?
- I want to see my father.

558
00:43:46,104 --> 00:43:49,039
- Who?
- My father, Nurullah Alizai.

559
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:50,975
Brought here two weeks ago
without charge.

560
00:43:50,977 --> 00:43:53,910
- Get out of here.
- I have money... 1,000 afghani.

561
00:43:53,912 --> 00:43:56,914
- I can give it to you if you promise to help.
- Hey, what are you doing?

562
00:43:56,916 --> 00:43:59,550
Nothing.
Just getting rid of a kid.

563
00:43:59,552 --> 00:44:01,619
Please! Open up!

564
00:44:01,621 --> 00:44:04,454
I have to see my father!
I have to see him!

565
00:44:06,959 --> 00:44:09,829
Now get out of here
unless you want some more.

566
00:44:49,068 --> 00:44:53,874
They say it doesn't always
rain the way it thunders.

567
00:44:55,974 --> 00:45:00,577
Last we heard of him,
the boy had fallen down.

568
00:45:00,579 --> 00:45:05,983
He had fallen down the hill
and into the deepest of sleeps.

569
00:45:05,985 --> 00:45:09,287
But all was not lost.

570
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:13,390
He was discovered
by an old woman.

571
00:45:13,392 --> 00:45:14,994
She had a drum.

572
00:45:16,528 --> 00:45:21,365
<i>A magic drum
that beat so beautifully</i>

573
00:45:21,367 --> 00:45:23,600
<i>that his heart woke up.</i>

574
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:38,448
<i>She knew he must be on a
quest, and so she asked him...</i>

575
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:40,984
What is it you seek?

576
00:45:40,986 --> 00:45:44,555
Well, you see, the dreadful Elephant
King sent his jaguars to steal the...

577
00:45:47,026 --> 00:45:50,428
No one has ever overcome
the Elephant King.

578
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:54,034
- I know.
- Well, what makes you think you can?

579
00:45:54,566 --> 00:45:56,033
I need to.

580
00:45:56,035 --> 00:45:57,635
I just need to,
that's all.

581
00:45:57,637 --> 00:46:00,537
That's not
a very good answer.

582
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:05,111
<i>Nevertheless, the woman told
him he'd need to find three things...</i>

583
00:46:06,713 --> 00:46:09,379
<i>something that shines,</i>

584
00:46:09,381 --> 00:46:11,716
<i>something that ensnares,</i>

585
00:46:11,718 --> 00:46:14,050
<i>and something that soothes.</i>

586
00:46:14,052 --> 00:46:18,155
<i>Only then would he overcome
the Elephant King.</i>

587
00:46:18,157 --> 00:46:20,057
Give them to me,
please!

588
00:46:20,059 --> 00:46:22,059
I don't have them,

589
00:46:22,061 --> 00:46:24,028
so you'd better
go look for them.

590
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:29,600
And hurry! If the seeds are not planted
soon, there will be no harvest.

591
00:46:29,602 --> 00:46:31,102
Yes, I know.

592
00:46:31,104 --> 00:46:33,470
<i>She told him to head east.</i>

593
00:46:33,472 --> 00:46:36,409
East is the other way.

594
00:46:37,543 --> 00:46:40,745
<i>Still something
followed the boy,</i>

595
00:46:40,747 --> 00:46:44,151
<i>and still
he could not face it.</i>

596
00:47:03,769 --> 00:47:07,171
- He didn't take the money?
- I don't think bribes work on them.

597
00:47:07,173 --> 00:47:10,774
No, no.
It probably wasn't enough.

598
00:47:10,776 --> 00:47:12,709
It might have
insulted him.

599
00:47:12,711 --> 00:47:16,247
You'll just have to save up more
and be even smarter next time.

600
00:47:16,249 --> 00:47:19,682
- Aaah!
- <i>I</i> have to be smarter?

601
00:47:19,684 --> 00:47:23,387
I've heard there is a guy who
pays well for small jobs.

602
00:47:23,389 --> 00:47:25,388
Come on.

603
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:27,691
Sir, we have come to work.

604
00:47:27,693 --> 00:47:30,827
- And you are?
- I'm Deliwar. And this is Aatish.

605
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:32,629
We are brothers.

606
00:47:32,631 --> 00:47:35,066
What kind of a name
is Aatish?

607
00:47:35,068 --> 00:47:36,700
I don't know.
Ask our father.

608
00:47:36,702 --> 00:47:40,407
- Where is your father?
- He was martyred by the Russians.

609
00:47:41,273 --> 00:47:43,207
We can do
any job you want.

610
00:47:43,209 --> 00:47:44,578
For the right price.

611
00:47:56,822 --> 00:47:59,122
That's the
last one, I think.

612
00:47:59,124 --> 00:48:00,825
Where are we anyway?

613
00:48:00,827 --> 00:48:03,794
About time. You boys
are not very strong.

614
00:48:03,796 --> 00:48:05,729
It was more work
than you said.

615
00:48:05,731 --> 00:48:07,798
Here you are.
Now be off.

616
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,334
Hey, we did all
that you asked.

617
00:48:10,336 --> 00:48:13,169
Wait! You said
you'd drive us back.

618
00:48:13,171 --> 00:48:15,305
I'm not a taxi.
Make your own way home.

619
00:48:15,307 --> 00:48:18,809
I'm late already because you
took so long to load the truck.

620
00:48:18,811 --> 00:48:20,579
Wait!

621
00:48:38,264 --> 00:48:40,330
I need to rest
a moment.

622
00:48:40,332 --> 00:48:43,336
Stay on the path.
This place might be mined.

623
00:49:05,557 --> 00:49:08,559
This is not nearly enough.
We need better jobs.

624
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:11,662
- Like what?
- I heard brick making pays well.

625
00:49:11,664 --> 00:49:13,600
But it's hard work.

626
00:49:15,334 --> 00:49:17,501
I wish I was stronger.

627
00:49:17,503 --> 00:49:19,702
But you have an older
brother, don't you?

628
00:49:19,704 --> 00:49:22,273
He used to bring you to
school on his shoulders.

629
00:49:22,275 --> 00:49:25,175
What's his name?

630
00:49:25,177 --> 00:49:26,612
Sulayman.

631
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:31,182
He died.

632
00:49:31,184 --> 00:49:33,684
How?
Was it the sickness?

633
00:49:33,686 --> 00:49:36,352
- I don't know.
- But your mother must have told you.

634
00:49:36,354 --> 00:49:38,525
She doesn't speak of it.
All right?

635
00:49:40,892 --> 00:49:42,528
All right.

636
00:49:45,697 --> 00:49:48,666
Hey, look
what I've got.

637
00:49:48,668 --> 00:49:52,669
I found it in a little box where
my father keeps his things.

638
00:49:52,671 --> 00:49:55,905
Can you believe
the water is that blue?

639
00:49:55,907 --> 00:49:57,710
It's very nice.

640
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:08,551
Anything written!
Anything read!

641
00:50:08,553 --> 00:50:11,821
Anything written!
Anything read!

642
00:50:11,823 --> 00:50:14,494
Anything written!
Anything read!

643
00:50:15,461 --> 00:50:17,461
I didn't pay you
last time.

644
00:50:17,463 --> 00:50:20,296
- How much do I owe you?
- It's okay. I...

645
00:50:20,298 --> 00:50:22,535
What, you don't charge
for bad news?

646
00:50:27,673 --> 00:50:30,274
Who taught you to read?
The crippled teacher?

647
00:50:30,276 --> 00:50:32,008
Yes. My uncle.

648
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:34,477
Can you write
as good as you read?

649
00:50:34,479 --> 00:50:35,748
I can.

650
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:39,318
Here.

651
00:50:41,887 --> 00:50:44,457
I kept this
in case you wanted it.

652
00:50:45,557 --> 00:50:47,992
Show me. Show me
where it says her name.

653
00:50:47,994 --> 00:50:50,463
Where it says
"Hala."

654
00:50:52,564 --> 00:50:54,367
There. See?

655
00:50:55,034 --> 00:50:56,669
Hala.

656
00:51:14,452 --> 00:51:16,820
Do you know
what it means?

657
00:51:16,822 --> 00:51:18,490
No.

658
00:51:19,724 --> 00:51:23,626
Sometimes, on a clear night
when you look at the moon,

659
00:51:23,628 --> 00:51:26,298
you can see a bright
outline around it.

660
00:51:27,532 --> 00:51:30,934
That outline
is called hala.

661
00:51:30,936 --> 00:51:34,374
My wife was named
for that light.

662
00:51:43,548 --> 00:51:45,349
- Here.
- This is too much.

663
00:51:45,351 --> 00:51:47,584
Don't argue with me.

664
00:51:47,586 --> 00:51:48,822
Thank you.

665
00:52:00,398 --> 00:52:04,068
Stop it, Zaki.
Can I pull yours?

666
00:52:06,104 --> 00:52:08,939
Keep him quiet.
I'm trying to sleep.

667
00:52:08,941 --> 00:52:12,843
- What's the matter with you?
- Why don't you tell Zaki a story, hmm?

668
00:52:12,845 --> 00:52:14,544
We'd all like that.

669
00:52:14,546 --> 00:52:17,914
Well, Zaki, do you want to know
what happened to the boy?

670
00:52:19,617 --> 00:52:21,885
Yes, yes,
and the elephant.

671
00:52:23,456 --> 00:52:27,758
The boy ran and ran, his
heart beating fast in fear.

672
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,928
<i>And the thing that chased him
never stopped.</i>

673
00:52:33,698 --> 00:52:37,503
<i>So the boy hid behind a tree
and he waited for courage.</i>

674
00:52:44,876 --> 00:52:48,111
<i>An ancient woman
had been trying to milk a goat,</i>

675
00:52:48,113 --> 00:52:50,546
<i>but her back was very sore.</i>

676
00:52:50,548 --> 00:52:55,986
My back is very sore.

677
00:52:55,988 --> 00:53:00,624
<i>The boy took pity on her and told her
to rest under the shade of a tree</i>

678
00:53:00,626 --> 00:53:02,693
<i>and he would do
the milking instead.</i>

679
00:53:02,695 --> 00:53:04,794
Please sit under
the shade of this tree,

680
00:53:04,796 --> 00:53:07,467
and I will do
the milking instead.

681
00:53:14,706 --> 00:53:16,740
<i>When he finished
milking the goat,</i>

682
00:53:16,742 --> 00:53:19,843
<i>the old woman shared
the lovely, warm milk with him.</i>

683
00:53:19,845 --> 00:53:23,814
<i>It was the nicest milk he had ever tasted,</i>

684
00:53:23,816 --> 00:53:26,483
<i>and he complimented the woman
on her goats.</i>

685
00:53:26,485 --> 00:53:28,684
Your goats
are very generous.

686
00:53:28,686 --> 00:53:31,921
<i>In return, the old woman
gave him a mirror.</i>

687
00:53:31,923 --> 00:53:36,126
See how it shines!

688
00:53:36,128 --> 00:53:38,629
<i>The boy was delighted
with the mirror,</i>

689
00:53:38,631 --> 00:53:43,737
<i>but as he looked into it, he saw the
reflection of the thing that followed him!</i>

690
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:49,705
What are you doing,
Mama-jan?

691
00:53:49,707 --> 00:53:52,508
I'm laying out
Soraya's good clothes.

692
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:54,845
Am I to sell them
at the market?

693
00:53:54,847 --> 00:53:57,851
Shh, shh, shh, Parvana.
It's time to sleep.

694
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:09,626
I just need to find
a way to get to Peshawar,

695
00:54:09,628 --> 00:54:11,762
and I can figure it out
from there.

696
00:54:11,764 --> 00:54:14,164
I think there's
a beach in Goa

697
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:16,533
where the tourists
are very rich.

698
00:54:16,535 --> 00:54:18,734
If they're rich, they
would buy my blue stones,

699
00:54:18,736 --> 00:54:22,071
and that's where I'd set up my
business, and you could join me.

700
00:54:22,073 --> 00:54:24,207
Once I find Baba.

701
00:54:24,209 --> 00:54:26,545
Once you find your Baba.

702
00:54:45,798 --> 00:54:47,097
100.

703
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:48,599
I'll give you 85.

704
00:54:48,601 --> 00:54:49,832
- Ninety.
- Eighty-two.

705
00:54:49,834 --> 00:54:51,834
Eighty-five,
and that's final.

706
00:54:51,836 --> 00:54:54,474
Eighty-five and a bunch of
grapes, and that's final.

707
00:54:59,244 --> 00:55:03,713
You're leaning too hard on the
pen, but your writing is good.

708
00:55:03,715 --> 00:55:06,485
If you try it more gently,
it'll be easier.

709
00:55:43,289 --> 00:55:45,658
Wait!
Wait a moment!

710
00:55:47,293 --> 00:55:49,158
What is it, child?

711
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:52,863
You asked me before about the man who
used to sit there... the teacher.

712
00:55:52,865 --> 00:55:55,999
- Your uncle?
- He didn't go to Mazar-e-Sharif.

713
00:55:56,001 --> 00:55:59,169
He was taken to prison.
But he did nothing wrong.

714
00:55:59,171 --> 00:56:00,736
- Which one?
- What?

715
00:56:00,738 --> 00:56:03,039
- Which prison?
- Pul-e-Charkhi.

716
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:06,578
It's been weeks now, and my
family has had no word of him.

717
00:56:08,646 --> 00:56:10,613
Go to the prison
on Wednesday.

718
00:56:10,615 --> 00:56:12,282
Ask for Roshan.
He's my cousin.

719
00:56:12,284 --> 00:56:15,854
Tell him Razaq sent you and
he will help you, if he can.

720
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,680
Deliwar!

721
00:56:43,682 --> 00:56:49,186
With work like this, I'll be an old
woman by the time I get to the sea.

722
00:56:49,188 --> 00:56:52,021
Or an old man.

723
00:56:57,229 --> 00:57:01,330
You sit and rest, Deliwar,
and I'll tell you a story.

724
00:57:01,332 --> 00:57:04,604
- A story?
- Yes, a story.

725
00:57:05,704 --> 00:57:07,269
One time
in the deep past,

726
00:57:07,271 --> 00:57:11,841
there was a boy who had to return a stolen
bag of precious seeds to his village.

727
00:57:11,843 --> 00:57:15,278
Is it a happy story
or a sad story?

728
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,584
Just wait and see.

729
00:57:18,916 --> 00:57:21,952
The boy had been told
he needed three things

730
00:57:21,954 --> 00:57:25,122
in order to overcome
the Elephant King...

731
00:57:25,124 --> 00:57:28,992
something that shines, something
that ensnares and something that...

732
00:57:28,994 --> 00:57:31,863
Hey, you two! Come here!

733
00:57:33,231 --> 00:57:35,064
Come on!

734
00:57:35,066 --> 00:57:36,666
I know that boy.

735
00:57:36,668 --> 00:57:39,202
Hurry up. Come here.

736
00:57:39,204 --> 00:57:40,836
Come on.

737
00:57:40,838 --> 00:57:43,642
We'd better do
what we're told.

738
00:57:46,744 --> 00:57:48,780
Get a move on,
lazy kids.

739
00:57:56,988 --> 00:57:59,021
So these are
the new workers?

740
00:57:59,023 --> 00:58:01,892
Where are your tongues? Are you stupid?

741
00:58:01,894 --> 00:58:05,095
Idrees suggested we have a
little arm-wrestling match.

742
00:58:06,097 --> 00:58:09,198
To see if you're strong
enough to work for me.

743
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,834
I saw you sitting down
over there instead of working.

744
00:58:11,836 --> 00:58:13,836
Idrees, stop now.

745
00:58:13,838 --> 00:58:15,805
Make me some tea.

746
00:58:19,778 --> 00:58:22,713
Let me see how feeble
<i>you</i> are, little one.

747
00:58:23,981 --> 00:58:26,251
He can't even
lift his hand.

748
00:58:27,885 --> 00:58:30,188
Get up and make us tea.

749
00:58:31,456 --> 00:58:34,925
Uncle, I think
you need new workers.

750
00:58:34,927 --> 00:58:37,794
- These ones are no good.
- Enough, Idrees.

751
00:58:37,796 --> 00:58:39,428
Leave the poor kids alone.

752
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:41,934
They are
a little undercooked.

753
00:58:45,771 --> 00:58:48,070
I know you.

754
00:58:48,072 --> 00:58:50,275
You're the teacher's daugh...

755
00:58:55,747 --> 00:58:57,881
Idrees.

756
00:58:57,883 --> 00:58:59,883
Bring the gun back!

757
00:58:59,885 --> 00:59:01,917
I said
bring the gun back!

758
00:59:01,919 --> 00:59:04,823
Idrees!

759
00:59:23,242 --> 00:59:25,041
Come out now!

760
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,412
Come out now!

761
00:59:30,414 --> 00:59:33,719
Idrees, it has begun!
We are moving west.

762
00:59:34,787 --> 00:59:37,553
We have been given orders
to go immediately!

763
00:59:37,555 --> 00:59:39,789
I know who you are!

764
00:59:39,791 --> 00:59:41,293
Do you hear?

765
00:59:42,394 --> 00:59:44,494
Get up here! Come on!

766
00:59:46,231 --> 00:59:48,868
Right now!
You little coward!

767
00:59:50,903 --> 00:59:54,874
You want to fight? Now
is your chance to fight!

768
00:59:56,842 --> 00:59:58,244
You become a man.

769
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,499
He's gone.

770
01:00:23,501 --> 01:00:25,568
What if he comes back?

771
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:27,870
He'd be lucky.

772
01:00:27,872 --> 01:00:29,439
Where are we?

773
01:00:29,441 --> 01:00:31,841
I came here once
when I ran away.

774
01:00:31,843 --> 01:00:35,914
I think the way in has gotten
smaller or I have gotten bigger.

775
01:00:36,615 --> 01:00:38,383
It looks old.

776
01:00:39,284 --> 01:00:40,950
I lost a shoe.

777
01:00:40,952 --> 01:00:44,454
I lost my cap, although
I think it's outside.

778
01:00:44,456 --> 01:00:46,291
Why did you hit him?

779
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:51,363
When they took my father,
he was one of them.

780
01:00:53,497 --> 01:00:55,231
Tell me more
about the boy.

781
01:00:55,233 --> 01:00:56,932
What boy?

782
01:00:56,934 --> 01:00:58,901
The story boy.

783
01:00:58,903 --> 01:01:01,637
The boy was cold.

784
01:01:01,639 --> 01:01:05,242
<i>Though the sun burned in
the sky, it gave no heat.</i>

785
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:08,245
<i>But he had a
warm hat and a big coat.</i>

786
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:09,979
<i>No, he didn't.</i>

787
01:01:09,981 --> 01:01:12,448
<i>He had already found
one of the three things...</i>

788
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:14,350
<i>a mirror that shone.</i>

789
01:01:14,352 --> 01:01:17,988
<i>But when he looked at it,
he saw something behind him.</i>

790
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:20,657
<i>Something scary.
Something dreadful!</i>

791
01:01:20,659 --> 01:01:23,626
- <i>A horse!</i>
- <i>No, Shauzia, not a horse.</i>

792
01:01:23,628 --> 01:01:25,528
<i>Yes, it was.</i>

793
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:29,131
<i>And it was a very old horse whose bones
clattered together when it walked.</i>

794
01:01:29,133 --> 01:01:32,369
<i>It wasn't scary at all.</i>

795
01:01:32,371 --> 01:01:36,673
<i>Fine. The boy felt sad for the
old horse and fed him hay.</i>

796
01:01:36,675 --> 01:01:38,642
<i>And they all lived
happily ever after.</i>

797
01:01:38,644 --> 01:01:41,378
<i>It's the middle of the
story, not the end!</i>

798
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:44,146
<i>From a door carved
into the stone,</i>

799
01:01:44,148 --> 01:01:46,448
<i>out came a round man.</i>

800
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:50,519
You wasted my hay on an old
horse that will soon be dead!

801
01:01:50,521 --> 01:01:53,622
<i>The round man threw the boy deep
into the belly of an ancient well.</i>

802
01:01:53,624 --> 01:01:56,228
Aaah!

803
01:01:57,496 --> 01:02:00,129
<i>At the bottom of the well
there were emeralds,</i>

804
01:02:00,131 --> 01:02:04,200
<i>and the round man wanted them brought up
to him as payment for the wasted hay.</i>

805
01:02:04,202 --> 01:02:06,568
You will bring
the emeralds to me.

806
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:08,604
- <i>What's his name?</i>
- <i>The round man?</i>

807
01:02:08,606 --> 01:02:10,372
No, the boy.

808
01:02:10,374 --> 01:02:13,609
You can't have a story about a
boy and not give him a name.

809
01:02:13,611 --> 01:02:15,544
Give him a name
before I do.

810
01:02:15,546 --> 01:02:17,414
Sulayman.

811
01:02:17,416 --> 01:02:19,919
His name is Sulayman.

812
01:02:20,552 --> 01:02:22,385
That's a good name.

813
01:02:22,387 --> 01:02:25,354
Sulayman lay
at the bottom of the well.

814
01:02:25,356 --> 01:02:28,457
<i>Suddenly, he could see skeletons.</i>

815
01:02:28,459 --> 01:02:33,296
<i>Three skeletons, each with an
emerald clutched in its bony hands.</i>

816
01:02:33,298 --> 01:02:35,131
- <i>He called out for help.</i>
- Help!

817
01:02:35,133 --> 01:02:38,267
<i>The poor old horse looked
back at him from way above.</i>

818
01:02:38,269 --> 01:02:41,171
<i>But the horse did
something extraordinary.</i>

819
01:02:41,173 --> 01:02:44,106
<i>He neighed with the voice
of all the world's animals.</i>

820
01:02:53,751 --> 01:02:57,053
<i>Sulayman climbed up, up,
all the way to the top,</i>

821
01:02:57,055 --> 01:02:59,421
<i>and he thanked the horse
for saving his life.</i>

822
01:02:59,423 --> 01:03:02,260
Thank you for saving my life.

823
01:03:07,131 --> 01:03:09,599
<i>Sulayman had just
three emeralds with him...</i>

824
01:03:09,601 --> 01:03:12,602
<i>And asked the round man for food in return.</i>

825
01:03:12,604 --> 01:03:14,336
<i>He was hungry.</i>

826
01:03:14,338 --> 01:03:16,606
<i>But the round man
was wicked and cheap.</i>

827
01:03:16,608 --> 01:03:20,477
<i>He threw a fishing net at Sulayman
and he told him to get his own food.</i>

828
01:03:20,479 --> 01:03:23,747
- <i>That was exactly what Sulayman needed.</i>
- Ha-ha!

829
01:03:23,749 --> 01:03:26,149
<i>Something that ensnares.</i>

830
01:03:26,151 --> 01:03:27,751
<i>But as Sulayman left,</i>

831
01:03:27,753 --> 01:03:31,488
<i>the ghosts of the three skeletons
came out of the three emeralds</i>

832
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:34,457
<i>and swirled and twirled
and scared the round man</i>

833
01:03:34,459 --> 01:03:37,760
<i>in frightful vengeance for
having lost them their lives.</i>

834
01:03:42,034 --> 01:03:45,667
<i>Sulayman and the horse continued
their journey toward the mountain,</i>

835
01:03:45,669 --> 01:03:49,171
<i>but the horse was getting
slower and slower.</i>

836
01:03:49,173 --> 01:03:52,541
<i>He needed to rest,
being very, very old,</i>

837
01:03:52,543 --> 01:03:55,445
<i>and so Sulayman made a
shelter for the horse</i>

838
01:03:55,447 --> 01:03:58,148
<i>and told him
to wait for him.</i>

839
01:03:58,150 --> 01:04:00,517
<i>The horse protested...</i>

840
01:04:00,519 --> 01:04:04,454
<i>but Sulayman knew he had to face
the Elephant King and the jaguars</i>

841
01:04:04,456 --> 01:04:06,088
<i>all by himself.</i>

842
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:08,126
I will see you again,
old horse.

843
01:04:10,327 --> 01:04:12,398
<i>And so on he went alone.</i>

844
01:04:24,809 --> 01:04:27,142
Tomorrow is Wednesday.

845
01:04:27,144 --> 01:04:30,148
I'm going back there,
to the prison.

846
01:04:31,749 --> 01:04:34,085
They'll have to
let me see him then.

847
01:04:55,273 --> 01:04:57,307
From now on,
you're staying inside.

848
01:04:57,309 --> 01:04:59,575
- It's much too dangerous.
- No, Mama-jan.

849
01:04:59,577 --> 01:05:01,778
- We manage all right out there.
- "We"?

850
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:05,715
Me and Deliwar. She's a girl too.
We work together.

851
01:05:05,717 --> 01:05:09,452
We've written to my cousin to arrange
a marriage for your sister in Mazar.

852
01:05:09,454 --> 01:05:11,588
They wrote back,
and it was accepted.

853
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:14,457
Someone will come for us the day
after tomorrow to take us away.

854
01:05:14,459 --> 01:05:16,358
- You don't need to do this anymore.
- What?

855
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,361
We can't go on
like this.

856
01:05:18,363 --> 01:05:20,863
- We can't depend on you to keep us alive.
- Why?

857
01:05:20,865 --> 01:05:22,731
I provide for you
just fine.

858
01:05:22,733 --> 01:05:24,901
It's not the job of a child.

859
01:05:24,903 --> 01:05:27,437
How can we leave
without Baba?

860
01:05:27,439 --> 01:05:29,905
Every day you come home
with cuts and blisters.

861
01:05:29,907 --> 01:05:33,611
Every day you go out there, and I don't
know if I'll see you back again.

862
01:05:34,746 --> 01:05:36,745
I can't lose you too.

863
01:05:36,747 --> 01:05:38,747
I'm not going.

864
01:05:38,749 --> 01:05:41,818
Baba could come back, and no one
will be here waiting for him.

865
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:44,254
So how long
should we wait?

866
01:05:44,256 --> 01:05:46,689
Until you're found out
and taken away from me?

867
01:05:46,691 --> 01:05:48,925
Until I have to send Zaki out
to earn our keep?

868
01:05:48,927 --> 01:05:51,227
Let me go see him
before we leave.

869
01:05:51,229 --> 01:05:53,428
Let me tell him
where we are going.

870
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:55,832
- Parvana!
- Let me bring him his walking stick.

871
01:05:55,834 --> 01:05:57,566
Then I will go with you.

872
01:05:57,568 --> 01:06:01,504
Then I will be a good sister
and a good daughter.

873
01:06:01,506 --> 01:06:03,109
I promise.

874
01:06:03,909 --> 01:06:05,510
I promise.

875
01:06:20,592 --> 01:06:22,258
Please don't go.

876
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:24,827
Please, it is much
too dangerous now.

877
01:06:24,829 --> 01:06:27,396
Mama-jan, I'm going.

878
01:06:27,398 --> 01:06:29,265
I'll be back tonight
before curfew.

879
01:06:29,267 --> 01:06:31,800
- No, Sulayman.
- Mama-jan.

880
01:06:31,802 --> 01:06:35,271
- You won't come back.
- Let her go now.

881
01:06:35,273 --> 01:06:37,409
Let Parvana go.

882
01:06:44,615 --> 01:06:46,552
Oh!

883
01:06:53,457 --> 01:06:55,561
Parvana.

884
01:07:31,595 --> 01:07:33,231
Deliwar!

885
01:07:34,666 --> 01:07:37,600
You frightened
me half to death.

886
01:07:37,602 --> 01:07:39,602
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

887
01:07:39,604 --> 01:07:42,537
Why? You want to work at the
chai shop with me this morning?

888
01:07:42,539 --> 01:07:46,441
- No, I can't.
- Hey, you want some candy for Zaki?

889
01:07:46,443 --> 01:07:49,280
We are leaving Kabul
tomorrow.

890
01:07:50,881 --> 01:07:52,749
You are leaving me?

891
01:07:52,751 --> 01:07:55,885
It's been arranged.
There's nothing I can do.

892
01:07:55,887 --> 01:08:00,023
My sister is getting
married in Mazar-e-Sharif.

893
01:08:00,025 --> 01:08:01,624
I'm going back
to the prison.

894
01:08:01,626 --> 01:08:03,626
I found someone
who can help me,

895
01:08:03,628 --> 01:08:05,861
and I need to get more money
to bribe the guard.

896
01:08:05,863 --> 01:08:07,763
I'll need it today.

897
01:08:07,765 --> 01:08:10,932
You'll just get another punch in the guts.
It's a stupid idea.

898
01:08:10,934 --> 01:08:12,769
I won't let that happen
this time.

899
01:08:12,771 --> 01:08:15,905
- I said it's a stupid idea.
- Please help me.

900
01:08:15,907 --> 01:08:17,774
What do you want me to do?

901
01:08:17,776 --> 01:08:21,043
Magic some money into your hand
like in your kids' stories?

902
01:08:21,045 --> 01:08:23,745
It doesn't work like that,
Parvana.

903
01:08:23,747 --> 01:08:25,715
I can't help you.

904
01:08:25,717 --> 01:08:29,819
Now run away to Mazar-e-Sharif
and have a nice wedding party.

905
01:08:29,821 --> 01:08:33,922
Maybe they'll find a husband for you
too and your troubles will be over.

906
01:08:33,924 --> 01:08:36,359
Until after the wedding,
at least.

907
01:08:36,361 --> 01:08:37,796
You fool!

908
01:08:40,932 --> 01:08:42,601
Deliwar!

909
01:08:43,668 --> 01:08:45,304
Shauzia.

910
01:08:53,812 --> 01:08:55,944
Shauzia.

911
01:08:55,946 --> 01:08:57,879
Come with us.

912
01:08:57,881 --> 01:09:00,416
I can't.

913
01:09:00,418 --> 01:09:03,554
My father would come all the
way to Mazar to kill me.

914
01:09:05,423 --> 01:09:08,427
I can't leave Kabul,
Parvana, not like this.

915
01:09:10,628 --> 01:09:13,363
- Here, take this.
- I can't take your money.

916
01:09:13,365 --> 01:09:15,334
Please take it.

917
01:09:18,436 --> 01:09:20,837
Go and see your Baba.

918
01:09:20,839 --> 01:09:24,907
Tell him that his daughter
is a good daughter.

919
01:09:24,909 --> 01:09:28,580
Tell him
that Deliwar said so.

920
01:09:34,853 --> 01:09:37,587
Hey, Deliwar.

921
01:09:37,589 --> 01:09:39,721
What?

922
01:09:39,723 --> 01:09:42,458
I'll meet you at that beach
you were talking about,

923
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:45,127
where the moon
pulls the water,

924
01:09:45,129 --> 01:09:47,029
20 years from today.

925
01:09:47,031 --> 01:09:50,166
I don't think I'll
recognize you then, Aatish.

926
01:09:50,168 --> 01:09:54,372
Well, you can sell me some pretty
blue stones for a great price.

927
01:09:56,407 --> 01:09:58,477
Until next time then.

928
01:10:01,478 --> 01:10:03,745
Until next time.

929
01:10:21,799 --> 01:10:24,033
Peace be upon you.
Are you Fattema?

930
01:10:24,035 --> 01:10:25,234
Yes, I am Fattema.

931
01:10:25,236 --> 01:10:28,503
I am your second cousin. Mohammed
Abdul sent me from Mazar.

932
01:10:28,505 --> 01:10:30,873
Gather your family.
We must leave immediately.

933
01:10:30,875 --> 01:10:34,644
No, you see, you weren't
supposed to come so soon.

934
01:10:34,646 --> 01:10:37,180
My son is away. We must
wait for him to return.

935
01:10:37,182 --> 01:10:38,948
There is a war coming.
Have you not heard?

936
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:41,050
We have to leave now
before they block the roads.

937
01:10:41,052 --> 01:10:43,819
We have to wait until she comes home.
I have to wait for my daughter.

938
01:10:43,821 --> 01:10:46,122
Son? Daughter? Which is it?

939
01:10:46,124 --> 01:10:47,989
Gather your things.
We are leaving now!

940
01:10:47,991 --> 01:10:50,892
I'm not leaving without Parvana.
We have to wait.

941
01:10:50,894 --> 01:10:52,895
Count yourself lucky
I'm taking you, old woman.

942
01:10:52,897 --> 01:10:54,896
The girl and the baby
are of more worth.

943
01:10:54,898 --> 01:10:56,798
I didn't come all this way
for nothing.

944
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,235
If we do not go now, we won't
get out of here at all.

945
01:10:59,237 --> 01:11:01,770
- My baby! Give him to me!
- Let's go! Argh!

946
01:11:01,772 --> 01:11:03,674
Zaki! Zaki!

947
01:11:04,709 --> 01:11:07,243
Give me my baby.
Give him to me!

948
01:11:07,245 --> 01:11:09,415
- No! Give him to me!
- Let go! Let go!

949
01:11:24,562 --> 01:11:26,828
- Salaam, little one.
- Salaam.

950
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:30,132
Where are you going to
with an old man's stick?

951
01:11:30,134 --> 01:11:32,735
It belongs to my Baba.

952
01:11:32,737 --> 01:11:35,707
I'm taking it to him,
to the prison.

953
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,477
I see.

954
01:11:39,244 --> 01:11:41,479
We're going that way.

955
01:11:48,652 --> 01:11:50,285
Give me my baby!

956
01:11:50,287 --> 01:11:53,823
- Let's go! If you want to keep the baby, come with me!
- Zaki!

957
01:11:53,825 --> 01:11:55,858
My daughter
is out there.

958
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:58,261
Then what kind of fool are you
to have sent her out alone?

959
01:11:58,263 --> 01:12:01,163
Get in, or she won't be the
only child you'll lose today!

960
01:12:01,165 --> 01:12:03,966
Don't...
Give me my baby!

961
01:12:03,968 --> 01:12:05,868
Keep him quiet!

962
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:07,837
I am begging you.

963
01:12:07,839 --> 01:12:12,744
Wait for my daughter!

964
01:12:59,957 --> 01:13:03,191
Come, Soraya.
We must start a fire.

965
01:13:04,995 --> 01:13:06,796
I am looking for Roshan.

966
01:13:06,798 --> 01:13:09,131
Hey!
I am looking for Roshan.

967
01:13:09,133 --> 01:13:12,601
I am looking for Roshan.
I am looking for Roshan.

968
01:13:12,603 --> 01:13:15,837
I am looking for Roshan.
I am looking for Roshan.

969
01:13:15,839 --> 01:13:18,039
- Open the door!
- Get away from the door, you stupid kid!

970
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:20,309
- I am looking for Roshan!
- Get out of here!

971
01:13:20,311 --> 01:13:22,278
- I am looking for Roshan!
- Are you stupid?

972
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:23,878
- I am looking for Roshan.
- Shut up!

973
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:25,247
What are you doing here?

974
01:13:25,249 --> 01:13:28,184
It's all right.
He's my son.

975
01:13:28,186 --> 01:13:30,688
You're wanted inside.

976
01:13:32,389 --> 01:13:34,323
That boy needs
some discipline.

977
01:13:34,325 --> 01:13:36,128
That's my business.

978
01:13:39,097 --> 01:13:42,898
What in the name of the
merciful are you doing here?

979
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:46,368
It's Wednesday. I've come
to meet your cousin Roshan.

980
01:13:46,370 --> 01:13:49,638
There's a war started.

981
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,774
Roshan has gone to fight.

982
01:13:51,776 --> 01:13:56,048
We've been brought from the city to clear the
prison of anyone who won't fight for us.

983
01:13:57,281 --> 01:13:59,080
- The teacher...
- Is he alive?

984
01:13:59,082 --> 01:14:00,749
I don't know.

985
01:14:00,751 --> 01:14:04,856
The teacher is my father.
I am Parvana, his daughter.

986
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:08,660
Help him, please.

987
01:14:10,894 --> 01:14:14,029
If I'm not back before the
sun has gone down, you run.

988
01:14:14,031 --> 01:14:17,800
Run as far away as you can from
here and you keep on running.

989
01:14:17,802 --> 01:14:20,168
You can't stay here after sunset.
Do you understand?

990
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:21,703
- Thank you.
- Do you understand?

991
01:14:21,705 --> 01:14:23,838
- Yes.
- Hide yourself until then.

992
01:14:35,786 --> 01:14:39,888
Once there was a young boy
called Sulayman.

993
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:42,858
He knew his heart was fated
to serve his people,

994
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:44,896
and he was running
out of time.

995
01:14:53,804 --> 01:14:57,306
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

996
01:14:57,308 --> 01:15:00,842
- Come on! Get in the car.
- We have to go back for my daughter.

997
01:15:00,844 --> 01:15:03,648
I said come here. Now!

998
01:15:04,314 --> 01:15:06,248
We're not going with you.

999
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:08,050
Mama-jan?

1000
01:15:08,052 --> 01:15:11,153
You, come now!
Do you hear me?

1001
01:15:11,155 --> 01:15:14,925
You come here like I told you to!

1002
01:15:16,126 --> 01:15:18,929
You come now!

1003
01:15:20,063 --> 01:15:23,798
We will not go with you.
Just drive away from us.

1004
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:27,136
Get in the car.
Get in the car now!

1005
01:15:27,138 --> 01:15:29,274
Mama-jan!

1006
01:15:33,777 --> 01:15:36,947
Sulayman! Sulayman!

1007
01:15:38,482 --> 01:15:40,818
Be brave, Sulayman.

1008
01:16:31,302 --> 01:16:33,068
Run, Soraya.

1009
01:16:33,070 --> 01:16:35,270
- Take Zaki and run now!
- Mama!

1010
01:16:35,272 --> 01:16:37,308
Go! Keep running!

1011
01:16:41,978 --> 01:16:46,016
You... let... us... go.

1012
01:16:56,594 --> 01:16:58,493
Open the door.

1013
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,962
What are you doing
with that?

1014
01:16:59,964 --> 01:17:03,769
He's dead. I'm putting him with the others.
Open the door. Let me through.

1015
01:17:18,582 --> 01:17:20,282
- Move, move, move, move, move!
- Stop!

1016
01:17:20,284 --> 01:17:23,852
- Line up. All of you, all of you.
- Stop!

1017
01:17:23,854 --> 01:17:25,421
I said stop!

1018
01:17:25,423 --> 01:17:27,590
It will be dark soon.

1019
01:17:27,592 --> 01:17:30,191
Razaq?

1020
01:17:30,193 --> 01:17:32,194
Razaq? Razaq?

1021
01:17:43,573 --> 01:17:45,541
Sulayman.

1022
01:17:45,543 --> 01:17:47,813
Sulayman.

1023
01:17:48,345 --> 01:17:49,611
<i>The mirror shines!</i>

1024
01:17:49,613 --> 01:17:51,950
<i>Use it to blind the jaguars!</i>

1025
01:18:04,262 --> 01:18:07,363
<i>The net ensnares!
Throw it over them!</i>

1026
01:18:07,365 --> 01:18:09,835
Hah!

1027
01:18:44,701 --> 01:18:47,168
Razaq. Razaq!

1028
01:18:47,170 --> 01:18:50,004
Razaq! I have come
for my father.

1029
01:18:50,006 --> 01:18:51,910
I have come for my Baba!

1030
01:18:52,543 --> 01:18:55,043
Put him down!

1031
01:18:55,045 --> 01:18:57,147
I said put him down.

1032
01:19:02,519 --> 01:19:05,154
Do you see
what is happening?

1033
01:19:05,156 --> 01:19:08,390
Where are you taking him?
Who's out there?

1034
01:19:08,392 --> 01:19:10,993
Look away, can't you?

1035
01:19:10,995 --> 01:19:13,164
It is just one man.
What does it matter?

1036
01:19:16,968 --> 01:19:19,568
Go.

1037
01:19:19,570 --> 01:19:21,369
Go!

1038
01:19:21,371 --> 01:19:23,305
Go, unless you're going
to kill me.

1039
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:29,677
I will scream and curse you

1040
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:33,681
until the last breath
leaves my body.

1041
01:19:33,683 --> 01:19:35,387
Go.

1042
01:19:38,621 --> 01:19:41,459
You're crazy. Crazy.

1043
01:19:43,059 --> 01:19:45,296
You can die out here
for all I care.

1044
01:19:45,729 --> 01:19:47,061
Die.

1045
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,490
Sulayman.

1046
01:20:13,557 --> 01:20:15,160
Sulayman.

1047
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:17,626
Sulayman.

1048
01:20:24,802 --> 01:20:27,237
I have not come
to kill you.

1049
01:20:38,049 --> 01:20:39,782
<i>Sulayman!</i>

1050
01:20:39,784 --> 01:20:41,516
<i>Soothe him with your story,</i>

1051
01:20:41,518 --> 01:20:44,319
<i>the one that Mama-jan
can't speak of.</i>

1052
01:20:44,321 --> 01:20:45,753
<i>Tell him.</i>

1053
01:20:45,755 --> 01:20:47,655
<i>Sulayman!</i>

1054
01:20:47,657 --> 01:20:49,658
My name is Sulayman.

1055
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:51,760
<i>Tell him what happened.</i>

1056
01:20:51,762 --> 01:20:54,430
<i>Tell him your story.</i>

1057
01:20:54,432 --> 01:20:55,797
My name is Sulayman.

1058
01:20:55,799 --> 01:20:58,100
My mother is a writer.

1059
01:20:58,102 --> 01:20:59,834
My father is a teacher.

1060
01:20:59,836 --> 01:21:03,372
And my sisters
always fight each other.

1061
01:21:03,374 --> 01:21:05,774
One day I found
a toy on the street.

1062
01:21:05,776 --> 01:21:07,743
I picked it up.

1063
01:21:07,745 --> 01:21:09,477
It exploded.

1064
01:21:11,182 --> 01:21:13,815
I don't remember
what happened after that

1065
01:21:13,817 --> 01:21:15,617
because it was the end.

1066
01:21:15,619 --> 01:21:18,654
<i>It's working, Sulayman!
Tell him. Tell him!</i>

1067
01:21:18,656 --> 01:21:21,190
My name is Sulayman.

1068

My mother is a writer.

1069

It exploded.

1074
01:21:40,443 --> 01:21:42,246
It was the end.

from the center of the mountain</i>

1087
01:22:12,876 --> 01:22:15,444
<i>and gave it back to Sulayman.</i>

1088
01:22:15,446 --> 01:22:18,446
<i>Sulayman returned
to his village.</i>

1089
01:22:18,448 --> 01:22:21,682
<i>There was much dancing
and singing</i>

1090
01:22:21,684 --> 01:22:24,254
<i>and laughing and eating.</i>

1091
01:22:31,695 --> 01:22:33,363
Razaq?

1092
01:22:39,603 --> 01:22:40,868
Baba?

1093
01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:43,507
Baba!
Is he alive?

1094
01:22:44,909 --> 01:22:48,409
It is not his blood.
He lives.

1095
01:23:08,831 --> 01:23:11,600
Get out of here now,
child. Go on.

1096
01:23:11,602 --> 01:23:14,272
As fast as you can.

1097
01:24:17,968 --> 01:24:19,767
It's the moon.

1098
01:24:26,977 --> 01:24:28,613
Soraya.

1099
01:24:29,545 --> 01:24:32,748
S... Sora... Soraya!

1100
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:34,983
- Mama?
- Soraya!

1101
01:24:34,985 --> 01:24:37,351
So...

1102
01:24:41,959 --> 01:24:46,264
<i>We are a land whose
people are its greatest treasure.</i>

1103
01:24:50,634 --> 01:24:54,639
<i>We are at the edges of empires
at war with each other.</i>

1104
01:24:56,973 --> 01:24:58,610
Par...

1105
01:25:00,643 --> 01:25:02,579
Parvana.

1106
01:25:04,348 --> 01:25:08,684
We are a fractured land in the
claws of the Hindu Kush mountains,

1107
01:25:08,686 --> 01:25:12,256
scorched by the fiery eyes
of the northern deserts.

1108
01:25:13,557 --> 01:25:17,728
Black rubble earth
against ice peaks.

1109
01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:22,797
<i>We are</i> Ariana,

1110
01:25:22,799 --> 01:25:25,736
<i>the land of the noble.</i>

1111
01:25:27,103 --> 01:25:30,739
<i>Raise your
words, not your voice.</i>

1112
01:25:30,741 --> 01:25:33,941
<i>It is rain
that makes the flowers grow,</i>

1113
01:25:33,943 --> 01:25:36,347
<i>not thunder.</i>

1114
01:25:36,349 --> 01:25:41,349
