7
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:59,537
I saw you serve a woman!
I saw you with my own eyes!

8
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:01,239
- Uh, I really don't think...
- You were!

9
00:02:01,241 --> 00:02:02,739
Anything written.
Anything read.

11
00:02:06,613 --> 00:02:08,415
Parvana.

12
00:02:10,283 --> 00:02:12,483
It's the only thing
of value we have left.

13
00:02:12,485 --> 00:02:16,420
I never wore it.
Not even once.

14
00:02:16,422 --> 00:02:18,855
Where would you wear it,
Parvana?

15
00:02:18,857 --> 00:02:22,560
- Let's continue your studies. All right?
- Yes, Baba.

16
00:02:22,562 --> 00:02:27,699
Now, what can you tell me
about the Silk Road?

17
00:02:27,701 --> 00:02:29,436
The Silk Road.

18
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,208
Baba, I can't remember
about the Silk Road.

19
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:37,808
Maybe if we think of it
like a story.

20
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,579
Stories remain in our hearts
even when all else is gone.

21
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:45,415
Our people have always told
stories, from our very beginning,

22
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:47,654
when we were Parthia
and Khorasan.

23
00:02:50,557 --> 00:02:54,324
<i>A fractured land in the
claws of the Hindu Kush mountains,</i>

24
00:02:54,326 --> 00:02:58,528
<i>scorched by the fiery eyes
of the Northern Deserts,</i>

25
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,566
<i>black rubble earth
against ice peaks.</i>

26
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:05,606
<i>Our land was the petrified
skeleton of a monster.</i>

27
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:08,338
<i>We were</i> Ariana,

28
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,810
<i>the land of the noble
and honorable.</i>

29
00:03:12,312 --> 00:03:15,013
<i>We were a pathway
to everywhere,</i>

30
00:03:15,015 --> 00:03:17,684
<i>carrying goods
from east to west.</i>

31
00:03:18,885 --> 00:03:20,550
<i>We studied the stars</i>

32
00:03:20,552 --> 00:03:23,754
<i>and began to see order
amidst the chaos.</i>

33
00:03:23,756 --> 00:03:27,824
<i>We were scientists,
philosophers, and storytellers.</i>

34
00:03:27,826 --> 00:03:31,496
<i>Questions sought answers
and then more questions.</i>

35
00:03:31,498 --> 00:03:34,998
<i>We began to see our place
in the universe.</i>

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,703
<i>But we were at the edges of
empires at war with each other,</i>

37
00:03:38,705 --> 00:03:41,538
<i>as borders were defined
and redefined...</i>

38
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,510
<i>over thousands of years.</i>

39
00:03:45,744 --> 00:03:49,616
<i>Of these mighty rulers
came Cyrus the Great of Persia.</i>

40
00:03:51,517 --> 00:03:54,420
<i>Then Alexander the Great
of Macedon.</i>

41
00:03:55,054 --> 00:03:57,754
<i>There came the Mauryan Empire,</i>

42
00:03:57,756 --> 00:03:59,691
<i>Genghis Khan,</i>

43
00:03:59,693 --> 00:04:02,060
<i>and so on and so on.</i>

44
00:04:02,062 --> 00:04:04,628
<i>Each time
there was bloodshed,</i>

45
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,833
<i>and each time
there were survivors.</i>

46
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:10,436
<i>A pattern repeating itself
endlessly.</i>

47
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:15,772
<i>When I was young, Parvana,</i>

48
00:04:15,774 --> 00:04:19,777
<i>I knew what peace felt like,
here in this city.</i>

49
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:23,948
<i>Children went to school,
women went to university.</i>

50
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,751
<i>All the empires
forgot about us,</i>

51
00:04:26,753 --> 00:04:27,952
<i>for a while at least.</i>

52
00:04:29,556 --> 00:04:31,556
<i>But it did not last.</i>

53
00:04:31,558 --> 00:04:34,424
<i>The ground became weak
under our feet,</i>

54
00:04:34,426 --> 00:04:36,760
<i>always uncertain.</i>

55
00:04:36,762 --> 00:04:39,996
<i>First came a coup d'état,
then an invasion,</i>

56
00:04:39,998 --> 00:04:41,701
<i>then a civil war.</i>

57
00:04:42,868 --> 00:04:44,434
<i>In the chaos,</i>

58
00:04:44,436 --> 00:04:47,573
<i>some looked to those
who might restore order.</i>

59
00:04:48,942 --> 00:04:50,607
<i>But at a great cost.</i>

60
00:04:50,609 --> 00:04:53,977
We have determined
specific dignity for women!

61
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:58,082
Women should not go outside and
attract unnecessary attention!

62
00:04:58,084 --> 00:05:02,619
If a woman shows herself, she will
be cursed by the Islamic Sharia

63
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:05,022
and should never expect
to go to heaven.

64
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:07,592
Everything changes,
Parvana.

65
00:05:07,594 --> 00:05:09,697
Stories remind us of that.

66
00:05:13,632 --> 00:05:16,734
Parvana, were you
listening at all?

67
00:05:16,736 --> 00:05:18,001
Yes, Baba.

68
00:05:18,003 --> 00:05:21,873
Why don't you tell me
about our nomadic ancestors

69
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,411
and their hills of gold?

70
00:05:25,145 --> 00:05:26,777
Well?

71
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:28,548
2,000 years ago...

72
00:05:29,481 --> 00:05:32,618
- Yes?
- 2,000 years ago...

73
00:05:33,652 --> 00:05:36,753
<i>there was a Bactrian princess</i>

74
00:05:36,755 --> 00:05:39,190
<i>who had a crown.</i>

75
00:05:39,192 --> 00:05:41,159
<i>And?</i>

76
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:43,027
<i>- And...
- Parvana?</i>

77
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:45,496
Away.
Keep away from my things.

78
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:48,765
Go away. I said go
away, you silly dog!

79
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:51,702
Hey, you! What do you
think you're doing?

80
00:05:51,704 --> 00:05:52,969
Why is this girl
shouting?

81
00:05:52,971 --> 00:05:55,205
She is only a child.
She meant nothing by it.

82
00:05:55,207 --> 00:05:56,974
She's drawing attention
to herself!

83
00:05:56,976 --> 00:05:59,544
She should be at home, not
displaying herself in the market.

84
00:05:59,546 --> 00:06:02,880
I have no son at home, except an infant.
I need my daughter to help me.

85
00:06:02,882 --> 00:06:04,549
- Stand up when we talk to you.
- I am a cr...

86
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:05,853
I said stand up!

87
00:06:12,592 --> 00:06:14,724
- I know you.
- Yes, Idrees.

88
00:06:14,726 --> 00:06:16,960
I was your teacher once.
You were a good student.

89
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:19,864
You wasted my time, teaching
me things of no worth.

90
00:06:19,866 --> 00:06:23,501
I have joined the Taliban and now
I fight the enemies of Islam.

91
00:06:23,503 --> 00:06:28,071
Well, if I am an enemy, then for
my sins God has taken my leg.

92
00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:29,941
Are you making fun of me,
old man?

93
00:06:29,943 --> 00:06:33,578
I lost my leg in the war.
The war we fought together.

94
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,746
- How old is the girl?
- Idrees.

95
00:06:35,748 --> 00:06:37,715
- She is a child.
- She's old enough to marry.

96
00:06:37,717 --> 00:06:39,549
I'll be looking
for a wife soon.

97
00:06:39,551 --> 00:06:41,551
She's already been promised
to someone.

98
00:06:41,553 --> 00:06:43,253
Well, she should
cover herself properly.

99
00:06:43,255 --> 00:06:45,655
- Maybe you should stop looking at her.
- What did you say to me?

100
00:06:45,657 --> 00:06:47,825
I said
stop looking at her.

101
00:06:47,827 --> 00:06:49,693
- I can have you killed!
- Idrees.

102
00:06:49,695 --> 00:06:51,895
- You watch what you say!
- That's enough. Come on.

103
00:06:54,601 --> 00:06:56,234
Are you all right?

104
00:06:56,236 --> 00:06:58,068
Yes, Baba.

105
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,606
That's my girl.

106
00:07:00,106 --> 00:07:01,707
Let's go home now.

107
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,826
Parvana?

108
00:07:19,993 --> 00:07:23,094
You told that boy
I was promised to someone.

109
00:07:23,096 --> 00:07:24,929
Am I getting married?

110
00:07:24,931 --> 00:07:27,731
Of course not.
You are still a child.

111
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:30,133
I want you playing
and telling stories.

112
00:07:30,135 --> 00:07:32,003
I'm too old for that now.

113
00:07:32,005 --> 00:07:35,106
Too old for stories?
You've always loved stories.

114
00:07:35,108 --> 00:07:37,044
What's the use?

115
00:07:49,022 --> 00:07:51,856
I'll have a word with Mama-jan
and we'll sort it all out.

116
00:07:51,858 --> 00:07:53,590
Please don't mention
the dress.

117
00:07:58,865 --> 00:08:01,765
Then I'll never
hear the end of it.

118
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:04,101
- The end of what?
- Nothing, Mama-jan.

119
00:08:04,103 --> 00:08:06,736
We're not selling
Parvana's good dress.

120
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:09,239
Baba, that's not
what I meant.

121
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:11,308
We need the money,
Baba.

122
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,111
We'll hold off for a bit. I
think business will pick up.

123
00:08:15,113 --> 00:08:18,181
If business picks up, then we
won't have to sell it, sure.

124
00:08:18,183 --> 00:08:21,987
But the sky is far and the earth is hard.
We will have to sell it soon.

125
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:24,054
Well, what about a little story
before dinner?

126
00:08:24,056 --> 00:08:27,657
And we'll forget all about
dresses for a while.

127
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:30,227
Maybe Parvana would like
to read something for us?

128
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:32,930
Not right now, Mama-jan.
I'm tired.

129
00:08:32,932 --> 00:08:35,800
She's not a child
anymore, she tells me.

130
00:08:35,802 --> 00:08:38,069
So she doesn't
like stories.

131
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:41,671
Don't be in such a hurry
to grow up, my sweet girl.

132
00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:44,041
It might not be
all that you expect.

133
00:08:44,043 --> 00:08:47,311
We're out of water. You didn't
bring enough this morning.

134
00:08:47,313 --> 00:08:49,245
But there's half a bucket
by the door.

135
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:53,350
When I was young enough to fetch
water, the buckets were never empty.

136
00:08:53,352 --> 00:08:55,219
- Hey!
- Girls, stop it.

137
00:08:55,221 --> 00:08:58,288
Either you go out and get
more water after dinner...

138
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,791
or you can wash
Zaki's dirty diapers.

139
00:09:00,793 --> 00:09:03,326
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

140
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:04,795
Now that you're here.

141
00:09:04,797 --> 00:09:09,934
Maybe if you didn't wash your hair so
much, we wouldn't run out so quickly.

142
00:09:09,936 --> 00:09:12,869
- Parvana.
- You should have some respect.

143
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:15,672
Why don't you eat,
hmm?

144
00:09:15,674 --> 00:09:19,913
- Things always look better when your belly is full.
- Yes, Maudar.

145
00:09:30,856 --> 00:09:33,257
Zaki, Zaki, wait till I
pull up your sleeves.

146
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:34,859
No, Mama-jan.

147
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:37,862
There. There you go.

148
00:09:37,864 --> 00:09:41,998
Don't eat all the raisins, Parvana.
Leave them for Zaki.

149
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,335
Why don't you give him that big
raisin on your chin, Soraya?

150
00:09:45,337 --> 00:09:47,705
Oh, but it's
not a raisin.

151
00:09:47,707 --> 00:09:49,809
It's a big,
hairy mole.

152
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:53,212
Parvana,
apologize to Soraya.

153
00:09:57,015 --> 00:09:58,651
Parvana?

154
00:10:04,756 --> 00:10:07,023
He's in there! I saw him!

155
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:08,792
- If there are women present...
- Baba?

156
00:10:08,794 --> 00:10:10,664
Cover yourselves now!

157
00:10:12,765 --> 00:10:14,998
That's the man.
An enemy of Islam.

158
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,268
He's got forbidden books, and he's
teaching the women with them!

159
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,171
- Leave us be!
- He's done nothing!

160
00:10:20,173 --> 00:10:25,075
Nurullah Alizai, you must come with us.

161
00:10:25,077 --> 00:10:26,444
Baba!

162
00:10:26,446 --> 00:10:29,013
- You can't take him!
- Baba!

163
00:10:29,015 --> 00:10:31,147
Baba-jan!

164
00:10:33,251 --> 00:10:35,085
Where is he being taken?

165
00:10:35,087 --> 00:10:37,088
To prison.

166
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,993
They'll teach him a good lesson
in Pul-e-Charkhi.

167
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:43,094
Baba!

168
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:44,762
Baba!

169
00:11:06,385 --> 00:11:10,354
Mama-jan?
Can I light the lamp?

170
00:11:10,356 --> 00:11:13,791
Hush, Parvana.
You'll wake Zaki.

171
00:11:13,793 --> 00:11:15,759
But if they
let Baba go,

172
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:18,528
he'll need a light in
the window to see home.

173
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:22,068
How could he come home? He doesn't
even have his stick to walk with.

174
00:11:24,504 --> 00:11:27,238
Go back to sleep.
It will be all right.

175
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,240
How do you know that, Mama-jan?
How do you know?

176
00:11:30,242 --> 00:11:33,914
Be quiet, Parvana. She has
enough to worry about.

177
00:11:45,323 --> 00:11:47,258
Hey!
Zaki, stop it.

178
00:11:48,861 --> 00:11:50,860
Get up, Parvana.
Stop playing around.

179
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:52,428
Why?
What's going on?

180
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,098
You and I
are going to find Baba.

181
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,002
The boy said he was being taken to Pul-e-Charkhi
prison, so that's where we are going.

182
00:11:58,004 --> 00:11:59,903
But we can't go outside
without Baba.

183
00:11:59,905 --> 00:12:02,006
Soraya is writing a letter
for the prison governor

184
00:12:02,008 --> 00:12:04,374
to protest Nurullah's arrest
and ask for his release.

185
00:12:04,376 --> 00:12:07,344
- At least I can give them that.
- Mama-jan, it's not allowed.

186
00:12:07,346 --> 00:12:10,547
We might be all right if we don't
draw attention to ourselves.

187
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:12,349
- But we can't...
- Come on, Parvana.

188
00:12:12,351 --> 00:12:15,154
And bring Baba's walking stick.
We have to get going.

189
00:12:25,164 --> 00:12:26,899
Mama.

190
00:12:47,252 --> 00:12:49,118
Hey.

191
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,057
Hey, you!

192
00:12:53,425 --> 00:12:56,226
Salaam. Can you tell me
the way to Pul-e-Charkhi?

193
00:12:56,228 --> 00:13:00,531
Salaam. Uh, it's east,
past the river.

194
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:03,032
- But it's a long way.
- Thank you, sir.

195
00:13:03,034 --> 00:13:06,273
Listen. Go through the old
town, or you'll be caught.

196
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,060
Why are you out here by yourself?

197
00:13:30,062 --> 00:13:31,995
- Where is your husband?
- I have no choice.

198
00:13:31,997 --> 00:13:34,931
It's not permitted to be out here
without your husband or your brother.

199
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:36,966
- I'm sorry. I know.
- Do you understand?

200
00:13:36,968 --> 00:13:40,037
- I am bringing a letter protesting my husband's arrest...
- Just go home.

201
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,537
- No!
- What do you mean, "no"?

202
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:43,272
This is Nurullah Alizai,
my husband.

203
00:13:43,274 --> 00:13:45,975
- He was arrested last night with no charges laid against him.
- Photographs are forbidden!

204
00:13:45,977 --> 00:13:49,412
- I have no one at home...
- What are you doing, showing me a photograph?

205
00:13:49,414 --> 00:13:52,917
- Out here by yourself. Go home!
- There is no one in my house except for children.

206
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:57,323
You have no business out here. Do you
understand? Go home. Immediately.

207
00:13:58,557 --> 00:14:00,427
You're looking
for trouble now!

208
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:12,136
You are an insult to your
husband, to your race!

209
00:14:12,138 --> 00:14:14,271
I need to find out
what happened to him!

210
00:14:14,273 --> 00:14:17,944
Shut up!

211
00:14:32,324 --> 00:14:35,325
Going to the prison
will change nothing.

212
00:14:35,327 --> 00:14:38,128
If you make trouble like this,

213
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,998
your husband will be punished
severely for your insolence.

214
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,938
And if I find you out here again
by yourself, I will arrest you.

215
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,173
Now go.

216
00:14:54,346 --> 00:14:56,213
Mama-jan?

217
00:14:56,215 --> 00:14:58,184
Take me home.

218
00:16:04,616 --> 00:16:06,316
- More!
- Shh.

219
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:09,118
Go get water, Parvana.
We have none left.

220
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,491
Come on.

221
00:16:40,785 --> 00:16:43,088
Get out!

222
00:16:44,222 --> 00:16:46,425
What are you up to?

223
00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:49,428
Get out of here.
They'll see you!

224
00:16:50,328 --> 00:16:52,128
Hey, stop!

225
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,500
Stop when I tell you!

226
00:16:59,605 --> 00:17:01,408
Through here!

227
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,142
Stop!

228
00:17:05,144 --> 00:17:06,742
Where did
that boy go?

229
00:17:06,744 --> 00:17:08,447
Did you see?
Did you see?

230
00:17:10,348 --> 00:17:12,316
- Hey, you! Girl!
- Hey!

231
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:14,453
- Come on!
- Forget about her!

232
00:17:19,157 --> 00:17:21,825
Parvana, this is
only half a bucket.

233
00:17:21,827 --> 00:17:23,693
Couldn't you fill them up
all the way?

234
00:17:23,695 --> 00:17:27,364
Zaki, shh. Don't wake her.

235
00:17:27,366 --> 00:17:30,666
- Hush, Zaki.
- Mama-jan!

236
00:17:30,668 --> 00:17:32,603
- Shh.
- Sooth him, Parvana.

237
00:17:32,605 --> 00:17:34,270
Mama-jan.

238
00:17:34,272 --> 00:17:35,806
Tell him a story.

239
00:17:35,808 --> 00:17:37,441
Mama...

240
00:17:37,443 --> 00:17:40,177
One time
in the distant past,

241
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:43,779
there was a little village at the
foot of the Hindu Kush mountains.

242
00:17:43,781 --> 00:17:46,682
- I want Mama-jan.
- Shh. Listen.

243
00:17:46,684 --> 00:17:51,154
The villagers had just managed
to gather precious seeds.

244
00:17:51,156 --> 00:17:55,558
And so, there was dancing and
singing and laughing and eating.

245
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,760
Everyone was happy.

246
00:17:57,762 --> 00:17:59,762
<i>Especially for one boy</i>

247
00:17:59,764 --> 00:18:03,799
<i>who danced and sang and laughed
and ate more than anyone else.</i>

248
00:18:18,951 --> 00:18:23,586
<i>While the villagers were dancing and
singing and laughing and eating,</i>

249
00:18:23,588 --> 00:18:24,723
<i>monsters were coming.</i>

250
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:35,501
<i>The monsters frightened the
donkeys and ate the trees.</i>

251
00:18:39,672 --> 00:18:42,739
<i>They stole the most precious
thing in the whole village...</i>

252
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,212
<i>the seeds
for next year's crop.</i>

253
00:18:49,682 --> 00:18:53,482
<i>Then they ran back to the Hindu Kush
mountains where their master lay...</i>

254
00:18:53,484 --> 00:18:57,354
<i>the dreadful Elephant King
with spikes for tusks.</i>

255
00:18:57,356 --> 00:19:00,723
<i>Grrrroar!</i>

256
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:04,393
Grroar! Grroar!

257
00:19:04,395 --> 00:19:06,697
Grroar!

258
00:19:08,567 --> 00:19:10,202
Mama-jan.

259
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:43,336
Please eat, Mama-jan. You'll feel
better when your belly is full.

260
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:05,288
There's hardly
any food left.

261
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,492
I'll go
to the market.

262
00:20:18,636 --> 00:20:21,307
- Salaam.
- Salaam. Twelve oranges, please.

263
00:20:21,906 --> 00:20:23,509
100 afghani.

264
00:20:24,676 --> 00:20:26,245
Thank you.

265
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:32,082
Salaam. How much
for six apples, please?

266
00:20:32,084 --> 00:20:34,483
Salaam, child.
I can't serve you.

267
00:20:34,485 --> 00:20:36,819
But, sir, can I please
have six apples?

268
00:20:36,821 --> 00:20:40,589
- Get your father to buy food for you.
- My father has been taken.

269
00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:42,794
I'm sorry.
Maybe come back later.

270
00:21:06,518 --> 00:21:08,652
Literally stolen.
But you know...

271
00:21:08,654 --> 00:21:12,325
Salaam. Can I have
a kilo of rice, please?

272
00:21:13,892 --> 00:21:16,026
- Salaam.
- Hey, you!

273
00:21:16,028 --> 00:21:17,893
Girl!

274
00:21:17,895 --> 00:21:19,331
Hey, stop!

275
00:21:22,401 --> 00:21:23,870
Stop when I tell you!

276
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,313
Go! Go home!

277
00:21:37,116 --> 00:21:38,648
I dropped the bag.

278
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,416
- Hush.
- I lost the money.

279
00:21:40,418 --> 00:21:42,619
- Keep your head back.
- I can get the water though.

280
00:21:42,621 --> 00:21:44,691
Don't worry
about that now.

281
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,723
I saved you
a piece of naan.

282
00:21:47,725 --> 00:21:51,363
I'll heat it up for you so it's
nice and fresh. All right?

283
00:22:12,617 --> 00:22:15,619
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know.

284
00:22:15,621 --> 00:22:18,854
Maybe if I go out early,
before it's crowded.

285
00:22:18,856 --> 00:22:20,623
It won't work,
Parvana.

286
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:24,161
Market sellers won't risk getting
in trouble for serving you.

287
00:22:24,163 --> 00:22:26,762
Mama-jan has cousins
in Mazar-e-Sharif.

288
00:22:26,764 --> 00:22:28,864
I could write to them
for help.

289
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:33,437
But we've never even met them.
How do you know they will help?

290
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:34,907
We need food now.

291
00:24:20,712 --> 00:24:22,645
These were
your brother's clothes.

292
00:24:22,647 --> 00:24:25,851
They will be big,
but we can take them up a bit.

293
00:24:27,251 --> 00:24:30,085
Do I look like
a boy?

294
00:24:30,087 --> 00:24:32,822
You look like
Sulayman.

295
00:24:32,824 --> 00:24:35,025
- So much like him.
- Mama-jan.

296
00:24:35,027 --> 00:24:37,626
He was such a good boy.

297
00:24:37,628 --> 00:24:40,896
Not much older
than you are now.

298
00:24:40,898 --> 00:24:42,000
Shh.

299
00:24:43,234 --> 00:24:45,235
It's all right,
Mama-jan.

300
00:24:45,237 --> 00:24:48,771
Parvana is going to the
market for food and water.

301
00:24:48,773 --> 00:24:51,776
It's the only way, Mama-Jan.
We have nothing left.

302
00:25:12,096 --> 00:25:15,332
But these juices are warm.
I don't want warm juice.

303
00:25:41,827 --> 00:25:44,928
Yes, that's what I said, but you know...

304
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:47,229
Salaam. Salaam!

305
00:25:47,231 --> 00:25:49,031
Excuse me. Salaam!

306
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:51,768
Salaam! Salaam!
Come inside, boy!

307
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,941
I'm not going to deliver, am I?

308
00:25:57,108 --> 00:25:59,912
But you
know how it goes, right?

309
00:26:02,114 --> 00:26:04,180
Well, let's hear it.

310
00:26:04,182 --> 00:26:09,055
I need a kilo of rice, a half kilo of
lentils, and a small amount of raisins.

311
00:26:10,288 --> 00:26:11,921
A small amount?

312
00:26:11,923 --> 00:26:14,289
Should I go
by my imagination?

313
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:15,991
Yes.

314
00:26:15,993 --> 00:26:18,928
Not very bright, this one.

315
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:23,266
Poor iron won't make a sharp sword.

316
00:26:23,268 --> 00:26:25,835
Look at him smiling!

317
00:26:25,837 --> 00:26:29,338
Little guy doesn't even know
when he's being made fun of.

318
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,876
Thank you.
Thank you very, very much.

319
00:26:52,931 --> 00:26:55,030
You're spilling
the tea.

320
00:26:55,032 --> 00:26:56,702
Sorry, Uncle.

321
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:06,276
Who are you? Why were
you staring at me?

322
00:27:06,278 --> 00:27:07,777
- What is your name?
- My name?

323
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:10,145
- I know you from somewhere.
- No... I wasn't...

324
00:27:10,147 --> 00:27:13,248
- Wasn't what?
- You don't know me.

325
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,050
- I do know you.
- No!

326
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:17,821
- I <i>do</i> know you! You're Parvana!
- I'm not!

327
00:27:17,823 --> 00:27:20,226
I am Shauzia! Remember?
From school?

328
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:24,928
- Shauzia?
- I had long hair then, but so did you.

329
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,130
- Deliwar.
- Don't tell anyone.

330
00:27:27,132 --> 00:27:28,668
Here's your cap.

331
00:27:29,934 --> 00:27:31,735
You need to get
a boy's name

332
00:27:31,737 --> 00:27:34,304
so you don't hesitate
next time somebody asks you.

333
00:27:34,306 --> 00:27:36,171
I am Deliwar now.

334
00:27:36,173 --> 00:27:37,806
It means "brave."

335
00:27:37,808 --> 00:27:40,175
- Where are you?
- I-I have to run.

336
00:27:40,177 --> 00:27:42,280
It was good to see you.

337
00:27:44,014 --> 00:27:45,818
Deliwar.

338
00:27:46,518 --> 00:27:48,485
Mama-jan, please sit down.

339
00:27:48,487 --> 00:27:53,056
- It will be curfew soon. What if she's not back by then?
- She's fine. I'm...

340
00:27:53,058 --> 00:27:54,390
Who's hungry?

341
00:27:54,392 --> 00:27:56,960
Parvana.

342
00:27:56,962 --> 00:27:59,194
Praise Allah. He has
returned you to me.

343
00:27:59,196 --> 00:28:02,766
Mama-jan,
you're squashing the naan.

344
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:04,837
It smells delicious,
Parvana.

345
00:28:12,144 --> 00:28:13,846
Zaki.

346
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,185
It's me. See?

347
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,856
I bought them
especially for you.

348
00:28:27,858 --> 00:28:30,826
Parvana?

349
00:28:30,828 --> 00:28:32,929
If you run out
and get some water,

350
00:28:32,931 --> 00:28:35,131
he'll get used to you
by the time you come back.

351
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:37,299
- But I'm tired.
- Hurry on, Parvana.

352
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:39,001
It's almost curfew.

353
00:29:06,865 --> 00:29:09,101
You look
so much like him.

354
00:29:09,968 --> 00:29:11,500
Go change
Sulayman's clothes,

355
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:13,303
or you'll
get them dirty.

356
00:29:13,305 --> 00:29:15,106
They are already
dirty.

357
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:25,280
Elephant.

358
00:29:25,282 --> 00:29:27,150
What?

359
00:29:27,152 --> 00:29:30,452
He wants you to continue your
story about the elephant.

360
00:29:30,454 --> 00:29:32,454
Elephant.

361
00:29:32,456 --> 00:29:34,193
Well, um...

362
00:29:35,193 --> 00:29:36,425
in the village,

363
00:29:36,427 --> 00:29:38,862
under the
Hindu Kush mountains,

364
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:41,400
the poor villagers
cried bitter tears.

365
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:48,203
<i>They did not know what they would do
without their precious bag of seeds.</i>

366
00:29:48,205 --> 00:29:50,973
<i>They would have nothing
to sow come next spring</i>

367
00:29:50,975 --> 00:29:53,242
<i>and nothing to eat
come next winter.</i>

368
00:29:53,244 --> 00:29:57,079
<i>But the boy,
he did not cry bitter tears.</i>

369
00:29:57,081 --> 00:29:59,281
<i>He looked toward the mountain
and he shouted...</i>

370
00:29:59,283 --> 00:30:01,550
I am not afraid of you,

371
00:30:01,552 --> 00:30:05,255
big, spiky,
bad Elephant King!

372
00:30:11,296 --> 00:30:14,998
<i>Well, maybe he was
a little bit afraid.</i>

373
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,567
<i>He told the villagers who had
been weeping bitter tears</i>

374
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:22,104
<i>that he would get the bag
of seed back before spring.</i>

375
00:30:22,106 --> 00:30:24,973
I will get the bag of
seed back before spring.

376
00:30:24,975 --> 00:30:27,477
<i>But they laughed.</i>

377
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:31,614
<i>They laughed and laughed, because he
was a child and not a great warrior.</i>

378
00:30:31,616 --> 00:30:34,383
<i>Yet the boy
repeated his promise.</i>

379
00:30:34,385 --> 00:30:38,387
I said, I will get the bag
of seed back before spring.

380
00:30:38,389 --> 00:30:40,155
<i>And he left the village</i>

381
00:30:40,157 --> 00:30:42,525
<i>to the sound of the Elephant
King's roars ahead of him.</i>

382
00:30:44,462 --> 00:30:46,331
<i>Roar!</i>

383
00:31:16,493 --> 00:31:19,027
Mama-jan,
now that I am a boy

384
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:22,030
we can go to the
prison and find Baba.

385
00:31:22,032 --> 00:31:24,566
No, Parvana,
we can't do that.

386
00:31:24,568 --> 00:31:26,068
- Why not?
- Shh.

387
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,537
It's not that simple,
Parvana.

388
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:30,405
But we have to try.

389
00:31:30,407 --> 00:31:33,008
- There's nothing we can do.
- That's not true.

390
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:35,481
Stop it, Parvana.
You're upsetting her.

391
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:48,524
Hey! Hey! I told you to stop!
Why do you keep running?

392
00:31:48,526 --> 00:31:50,593
You should have stopped
when you were told to.

393
00:31:50,595 --> 00:31:54,197
Where's your burqa? Why are you
dressed like this outside your house?

394
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:57,700
My husband took my burqa.
I needed to buy medicine.

395
00:31:57,702 --> 00:31:59,469
Stop it. Stop it.

396
00:31:59,471 --> 00:32:02,572
He should be punished for
letting you outside like this!

397
00:32:02,574 --> 00:32:05,274
- Please, please! Please!
- You have to take his punishment!

398
00:32:09,547 --> 00:32:12,217
Stay inside
where you belong!

399
00:32:29,733 --> 00:32:32,471
Deliwar. Deliwar!

400
00:32:34,772 --> 00:32:36,806
Well? Have you remembered
your name yet?

401
00:32:36,808 --> 00:32:39,608
I don't think
I can go on like this.

402
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,546
Too bad.
I could use some help.

403
00:32:46,584 --> 00:32:49,652
- I saw something.
- What do you want me to say?

404
00:32:49,654 --> 00:32:51,153
I should have helped.

405
00:32:51,155 --> 00:32:54,690
- You'd have helped yourself to a good whipping, that's all.
- But I'm not a boy.

406
00:32:54,692 --> 00:32:56,625
You're not a boy,
you're not a girl.

407
00:32:56,627 --> 00:33:00,430
I need a helper because this tray
is too heavy. Will you help?

408
00:33:00,432 --> 00:33:04,600
Scratch my nose. Quickly. If I let go
of the tray, the strap will break.

409
00:33:04,602 --> 00:33:06,169
That's better.

410
00:33:06,171 --> 00:33:07,737
- Aatish.
- What?

411
00:33:07,739 --> 00:33:10,506
I remembered my name.
It's Aatish.

412
00:33:10,508 --> 00:33:12,842
- That's not really a name.
- It means "fire."

413
00:33:12,844 --> 00:33:16,578
I know what it means,
but it's still not a name.

414
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,681
Then it suits me fine.

415
00:33:18,683 --> 00:33:20,285
I'll call you
Aatish then.

416
00:33:21,418 --> 00:33:24,487
When you're a boy you can
go anywhere you like,

417
00:33:24,489 --> 00:33:26,290
Aatish Khan.

418
00:33:34,699 --> 00:33:36,431
Where are we going?

419
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:38,170
You'll see.

420
00:33:53,718 --> 00:33:55,750
What if someone
sees us?

421
00:33:55,752 --> 00:33:58,220
I usually just pretend
I work here.

422
00:33:58,222 --> 00:34:00,459
If you look like you believe
it, then they will too.

423
00:34:01,725 --> 00:34:03,628
See? We're cleaners.

424
00:34:35,893 --> 00:34:37,860
What are you
waiting for?

425
00:34:37,862 --> 00:34:40,262
It's either ours,
or the mice eat it.

426
00:34:40,264 --> 00:34:42,664
I need to find a way
to see my Baba.

427
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:45,467
You can have mine if you like.
I don't want him.

428
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:49,304
My father was taken to prison and
we've heard nothing of him since.

429
00:34:49,306 --> 00:34:51,874
- They won't let you see him, Parvana.
- But I'm a boy now.

430
00:34:51,876 --> 00:34:55,610
Doesn't make a difference. They'll keep him or
let him go, but there's nothing you can do.

431
00:34:55,612 --> 00:34:57,813
You don't know that.

432
00:34:57,815 --> 00:35:01,286
I'm sorry.
It's just the way it is.

433
00:35:03,721 --> 00:35:08,557
There might be a way, but
you'll need lots of money.

434
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:10,492
What for?

435
00:35:10,494 --> 00:35:13,699
You can get a lot done
with bribes. A lot.

436
00:35:18,302 --> 00:35:20,672
Anything written.
Anything read.

437
00:35:22,273 --> 00:35:24,273
Pashto and Dari.

438
00:35:24,275 --> 00:35:26,278
Wonderful items
for sale.

439
00:35:27,277 --> 00:35:29,778
Anything written!
Anything read!

440
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,280
Anything written!
Anything read!

441
00:35:32,282 --> 00:35:34,520
What happened to the man
who used to sit here?

442
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,887
It is a simple question.

443
00:35:37,889 --> 00:35:39,722
Don't you know?

444
00:35:39,724 --> 00:35:42,657
How should I know? Answer the question.
Where is he?

445
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:45,827
- He left for Mazar-e-Sharif.
- And what are you to him?

446
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:50,335
I'm his nephew,
uh... Aatish.

447
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:54,269
Do you know
how to read?

448
00:35:54,271 --> 00:35:58,309
- Do you have something to read? I read Pashto and Dari.
- Read this.

449
00:36:01,545 --> 00:36:03,581
Let's see
if you're any good.

450
00:36:10,288 --> 00:36:12,657
Come on. Take it out
of the envelope.

451
00:36:14,992 --> 00:36:16,592
"Dear Razaq..."

452
00:36:16,594 --> 00:36:19,595
Louder, or I will have to
take my business elsewhere.

453
00:36:19,597 --> 00:36:22,999
"Dear Razaq, I hope this
letter reaches you in Kabul.

454
00:36:23,001 --> 00:36:26,001
I'm writing to you
with sad news.

455
00:36:26,003 --> 00:36:31,242
I am sorry to tell you that Hala Begum
died on the way to her sister's wedding.

456
00:36:32,476 --> 00:36:35,911
The bus she was traveling on
hit a land mine.

457
00:36:35,913 --> 00:36:38,347
Her injuries
were too great to bear

458
00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:40,715
and she died
some hours afterward.

459
00:36:40,717 --> 00:36:43,351
I know this must be
a great shock to you,

460
00:36:43,353 --> 00:36:45,688
but please know that when
I last spoke to Hala,

461
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:48,393
she told me of your
kindness toward her.

462
00:36:49,893 --> 00:36:51,994
May Allah bless you now,

463
00:36:51,996 --> 00:36:54,633
guide your path,
and give you courage."

464
00:36:57,969 --> 00:36:59,737
I'm sorry.

465
00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:35,371
Ah, there's
my sweet little girl

466
00:37:35,373 --> 00:37:37,072
underneath
all the dust of Kabul.

467
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:41,409
Parvana,
what did you give Zaki?

468
00:37:41,411 --> 00:37:43,679
- It's a piece of candy.
- A piece?

469
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:45,880
Oh!

470
00:37:45,882 --> 00:37:48,351
It's big enough
to choke him!

471
00:37:48,353 --> 00:37:51,086
Let him be, Soraya.
You're spoiling his fun.

472
00:37:52,789 --> 00:37:54,090
Ow!

473
00:37:54,092 --> 00:37:56,992
Continue
the story, Parvana.

474
00:37:56,994 --> 00:37:59,128
For Zaki.

475
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,563
There was this young boy,

476
00:38:01,565 --> 00:38:06,135
and he promised his people
to find the precious seeds.

477
00:38:06,137 --> 00:38:08,371
Elephant?
Elephant?

478
00:38:08,373 --> 00:38:11,474
Yes,
and the elephant.

479
00:38:11,476 --> 00:38:14,744
At night, the boy walked
through the pine trees

480
00:38:14,746 --> 00:38:17,782
on his way to the mountain
to face the Elephant King.

481
00:38:24,722 --> 00:38:27,590
<i>Something was following him
in the darkness,</i>

482
00:38:27,592 --> 00:38:30,595
<i>but he was too terrified
to turn around and face it.</i>

483
00:38:31,963 --> 00:38:33,595
<i>He began to run,</i>

484
00:38:33,597 --> 00:38:35,800
<i>and the thing
that chased him also ran.</i>

485
00:38:38,536 --> 00:38:41,740
<i>The boy ran faster
and so did his pursuer.</i>

486
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,572
<i>He ran into the night,</i>

487
00:38:44,574 --> 00:38:48,413
<i>chased by the unknown demons
until he could run no more.</i>

488
00:38:49,012 --> 00:38:50,880
<i>He tumbled down a hill.</i>

489
00:38:50,882 --> 00:38:52,818
<i>Down.</i>

490
00:38:53,951 --> 00:38:56,018
<i>Down.</i>

491
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,621
<i>Down.</i>

492
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:17,072
<i>Dear Cousin, it has been
many years since we have spoken,</i>

493
00:39:17,074 --> 00:39:21,976
<i>but I am writing to you now to tell
you that my husband has been arrested</i>

494
00:39:21,978 --> 00:39:25,951
<i>and we have no word on when
he will be released, if at all.</i>

495
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:31,556
<i>My family is in a desperate
situation and I need your help.</i>

496
00:39:32,523 --> 00:39:34,490
<i>My eldest daughter
is now of age,</i>

497
00:39:34,492 --> 00:39:39,431
<i>and I am asking that you consider her as
a bride for your youngest son, Ajmal.</i>

498
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:43,599
<i>Please take us out of Kabul</i>

499
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:46,802
<i>so that we may have
a chance of survival.</i>

500
00:39:46,804 --> 00:39:49,204
<i>We will not be
a burden to you.</i>

501
00:39:49,206 --> 00:39:51,106
<i>We are skilled and strong</i>

502
00:39:51,108 --> 00:39:53,876
<i>and need little
by the way of means.</i>

503
00:39:53,878 --> 00:39:57,816
<i>May the blessings of Allah
be upon you. Fattema.</i>

504
00:40:01,184 --> 00:40:04,186
Anything written!
Anything read!

505
00:40:04,188 --> 00:40:07,056
Anything written!
Anything read!

506
00:40:07,058 --> 00:40:08,490
Anything written!

507
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:10,659
How much
for the dress?

508
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:12,094
Salaam. It's handmade.

509
00:40:12,096 --> 00:40:14,262
- How much?
- 3,000.

510
00:40:14,264 --> 00:40:16,932
Don't be stupid.
I'll give you 300.

511
00:40:16,934 --> 00:40:18,566
2,000.

512
00:40:18,568 --> 00:40:20,503
Handmade
in Mazar-e-Sharif.

513
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:24,509
Your daughter will be very happy
to wear such a beautiful dress.

514
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,612
She is my wife.

515
00:40:29,246 --> 00:40:30,979
1,500.

516
00:40:30,981 --> 00:40:32,717
See how it sparkles?

517
00:40:34,085 --> 00:40:36,588
Here's 1,000.

518
00:40:44,896 --> 00:40:47,729
- How much did you make?
- A thousand.

519
00:40:47,731 --> 00:40:50,298
That might be enough
for a good bribe.

520
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,534
- Really?
- Definitely.

521
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:56,271
I'm saving up too. Whatever money I
can hide from my father, I keep.

522
00:40:56,273 --> 00:40:59,478
And it's mounting up
to a nice little sum.

523
00:41:00,076 --> 00:41:01,876
See?

524
00:41:01,878 --> 00:41:04,646
I'm not going to stay
here forever, you know.

525
00:41:04,648 --> 00:41:07,615
- Have you ever been to the sea?
- No.

526
00:41:07,617 --> 00:41:08,816
Neither have I.

527
00:41:08,818 --> 00:41:13,222
But I've heard that the moon
pulls the water onto the shore

528
00:41:13,224 --> 00:41:15,157
and then
back out again.

529
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:16,724
I want to see that.

530
00:41:16,726 --> 00:41:21,697
I want to put my feet on the warm sand and
have them cooled by the lapping water.

531
00:41:21,699 --> 00:41:26,034
What about your father?
Doesn't he depend on you?

532
00:41:26,036 --> 00:41:27,638
I am a good son.

533
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:30,642
But he is not
a good father.

534
00:41:32,777 --> 00:41:35,144
What will you do by the sea?

535
00:41:35,146 --> 00:41:40,182
I'd buy things and sell things,
like I do here, but for myself.

536
00:41:40,184 --> 00:41:44,286
There are people who go to the
edge of the water to do nothing.

537
00:41:44,288 --> 00:41:47,690
They just sit there and they look
at the sea with their sunglasses on

538
00:41:47,692 --> 00:41:49,791
or swim about
on floating tubes.

539
00:41:49,793 --> 00:41:52,760
So I could sell them
those things.

540
00:41:52,762 --> 00:41:55,764
Hmm. That sounds nice, Deliwar.

541
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:57,932
And maybe
I'll join you.

542
00:41:57,934 --> 00:42:00,105
- Where are you going?
- Wish me luck.

543
00:42:07,712 --> 00:42:11,280
- Why are you back so early?
- I have brought some bread and raisins for Zaki.

544
00:42:11,282 --> 00:42:13,081
What are you doing,
Parvana?

545
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:14,682
I'm going to find Baba.

546
00:42:14,684 --> 00:42:16,351
- No, you're not.
- I'm going.

547
00:42:16,353 --> 00:42:18,387
You won't make it home
before curfew.

548
00:42:18,389 --> 00:42:20,755
I'm going. There's nothing
you can do to stop me.

549
00:42:20,757 --> 00:42:24,193
Mama-jan has been through enough
without you doing something so stupid.

550
00:42:24,195 --> 00:42:26,295
- I have to find him.
- Parvana!

551
00:42:26,297 --> 00:42:28,032
Parvana!

552
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:30,168
Parvana!

553
00:43:33,963 --> 00:43:35,364
Excuse me.

554
00:43:35,366 --> 00:43:37,865
Salaam. Hello!

555
00:43:37,867 --> 00:43:39,835
Excuse me!

556
00:43:39,837 --> 00:43:42,170
What do you want?

557
00:43:42,172 --> 00:43:44,972
- I said, what do you want?
- I want to see my father.

558
00:43:44,974 --> 00:43:47,909
- Who?
- My father, Nurullah Alizai.

559
00:43:47,911 --> 00:43:49,845
Brought here two weeks ago
without charge.

560
00:43:49,847 --> 00:43:52,780
- Get out of here.
- I have money... 1,000 afghani.

561
00:43:52,782 --> 00:43:55,784
- I can give it to you if you promise to help.
- Hey, what are you doing?

562
00:43:55,786 --> 00:43:58,420
Nothing.
Just getting rid of a kid.

563
00:43:58,422 --> 00:44:00,489
Please! Open up!

564
00:44:00,491 --> 00:44:03,324
I have to see my father!
I have to see him!

565
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:08,699
Now get out of here
unless you want some more.

566
00:44:47,938 --> 00:44:52,744
They say it doesn't always
rain the way it thunders.

567
00:44:54,844 --> 00:44:59,447
Last we heard of him,
the boy had fallen down.

568
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:04,853
He had fallen down the hill
and into the deepest of sleeps.

569
00:45:04,855 --> 00:45:08,157
But all was not lost.

570
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:12,260
He was discovered
by an old woman.

571
00:45:12,262 --> 00:45:13,864
She had a drum.

572
00:45:15,398 --> 00:45:20,235
<i>A magic drum
that beat so beautifully</i>

573
00:45:20,237 --> 00:45:22,470
<i>that his heart woke up.</i>

574
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:37,318
<i>She knew he must be on a
quest, and so she asked him...</i>

575
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,854
What is it you seek?

576
00:45:39,856 --> 00:45:43,425
Well, you see, the dreadful Elephant
King sent his jaguars to steal the...

577
00:45:45,896 --> 00:45:49,298
No one has ever overcome
the Elephant King.

578
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:52,904
- I know.
- Well, what makes you think you can?

579
00:45:53,436 --> 00:45:54,903
I need to.

580
00:45:54,905 --> 00:45:56,505
I just need to,
that's all.

581
00:45:56,507 --> 00:45:59,407
That's not
a very good answer.

582
00:45:59,409 --> 00:46:03,981
<i>Nevertheless, the woman told
him he'd need to find three things...</i>

583
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:08,249
<i>something that shines,</i>

584
00:46:08,251 --> 00:46:10,586
<i>something that ensnares,</i>

585
00:46:10,588 --> 00:46:12,920
<i>and something that soothes.</i>

586
00:46:12,922 --> 00:46:17,025
<i>Only then would he overcome
the Elephant King.</i>

587
00:46:17,027 --> 00:46:18,927
Give them to me,
please!

588
00:46:18,929 --> 00:46:20,929
I don't have them,

589
00:46:20,931 --> 00:46:22,898
so you'd better
go look for them.

590
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:28,470
And hurry! If the seeds are not planted
soon, there will be no harvest.

591
00:46:28,472 --> 00:46:29,972
Yes, I know.

592
00:46:29,974 --> 00:46:32,340
<i>She told him to head east.</i>

593
00:46:32,342 --> 00:46:35,279
East is the other way.

594
00:46:36,413 --> 00:46:39,615
<i>Still something
followed the boy,</i>

595
00:46:39,617 --> 00:46:43,021
<i>and still
he could not face it.</i>

596
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:06,041
- He didn't take the money?
- I don't think bribes work on them.

597
00:47:06,043 --> 00:47:09,644
No, no.
It probably wasn't enough.

598
00:47:09,646 --> 00:47:11,579
It might have
insulted him.

599
00:47:11,581 --> 00:47:15,117
You'll just have to save up more
and be even smarter next time.

600
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,552
- Aaah!
- <i>I</i> have to be smarter?

601
00:47:18,554 --> 00:47:22,257
I've heard there is a guy who
pays well for small jobs.

602
00:47:22,259 --> 00:47:24,258
Come on.

603
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,561
Sir, we have come to work.

604
00:47:26,563 --> 00:47:29,697
- And you are?
- I'm Deliwar. And this is Aatish.

605
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:31,499
We are brothers.

606
00:47:31,501 --> 00:47:33,936
What kind of a name
is Aatish?

607
00:47:33,938 --> 00:47:35,570
I don't know.
Ask our father.

608
00:47:35,572 --> 00:47:39,277
- Where is your father?
- He was martyred by the Russians.

609
00:47:40,143 --> 00:47:42,077
We can do
any job you want.

610
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,448
For the right price.

611
00:47:55,692 --> 00:47:57,992
That's the
last one, I think.

612
00:47:57,994 --> 00:47:59,695
Where are we anyway?

613
00:47:59,697 --> 00:48:02,664
About time. You boys
are not very strong.

614
00:48:02,666 --> 00:48:04,599
It was more work
than you said.

615
00:48:04,601 --> 00:48:06,668
Here you are.
Now be off.

616
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:09,204
Hey, we did all
that you asked.

617
00:48:09,206 --> 00:48:12,039
Wait! You said
you'd drive us back.

618
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:14,175
I'm not a taxi.
Make your own way home.

619
00:48:14,177 --> 00:48:17,679
I'm late already because you
took so long to load the truck.

620
00:48:17,681 --> 00:48:19,449
Wait!

621
00:48:37,134 --> 00:48:39,200
I need to rest
a moment.

622
00:48:39,202 --> 00:48:42,206
Stay on the path.
This place might be mined.

623
00:49:04,427 --> 00:49:07,429
This is not nearly enough.
We need better jobs.

624
00:49:07,431 --> 00:49:10,532
- Like what?
- I heard brick making pays well.

625
00:49:10,534 --> 00:49:12,470
But it's hard work.

626
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:16,371
I wish I was stronger.

627
00:49:16,373 --> 00:49:18,572
But you have an older
brother, don't you?

628
00:49:18,574 --> 00:49:21,143
He used to bring you to
school on his shoulders.

629
00:49:21,145 --> 00:49:24,045
What's his name?

630
00:49:24,047 --> 00:49:25,482
Sulayman.

631
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:30,052
He died.

632
00:49:30,054 --> 00:49:32,554
How?
Was it the sickness?

633
00:49:32,556 --> 00:49:35,222
- I don't know.
- But your mother must have told you.

634
00:49:35,224 --> 00:49:37,395
She doesn't speak of it.
All right?

635
00:49:39,762 --> 00:49:41,398
All right.

636
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:47,536
Hey, look
what I've got.

637
00:49:47,538 --> 00:49:51,539
I found it in a little box where
my father keeps his things.

638
00:49:51,541 --> 00:49:54,775
Can you believe
the water is that blue?

639
00:49:54,777 --> 00:49:56,580
It's very nice.

640
00:50:04,521 --> 00:50:07,421
Anything written!
Anything read!

641
00:50:07,423 --> 00:50:10,691
Anything written!
Anything read!

642
00:50:10,693 --> 00:50:13,364
Anything written!
Anything read!

643
00:50:14,331 --> 00:50:16,331
I didn't pay you
last time.

644
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:19,166
- How much do I owe you?
- It's okay. I...

645
00:50:19,168 --> 00:50:21,405
What, you don't charge
for bad news?

646
00:50:26,543 --> 00:50:29,144
Who taught you to read?
The crippled teacher?

647
00:50:29,146 --> 00:50:30,878
Yes. My uncle.

648
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,347
Can you write
as good as you read?

649
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:34,618
I can.

650
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,188
Here.

651
00:50:40,757 --> 00:50:43,327
I kept this
in case you wanted it.

652
00:50:44,427 --> 00:50:46,862
Show me. Show me
where it says her name.

653
00:50:46,864 --> 00:50:49,333
Where it says
"Hala."

654
00:50:51,434 --> 00:50:53,237
There. See?

655
00:50:53,904 --> 00:50:55,539
Hala.

656
00:51:13,322 --> 00:51:15,690
Do you know
what it means?

657
00:51:15,692 --> 00:51:17,360
No.

658
00:51:18,594 --> 00:51:22,496
Sometimes, on a clear night
when you look at the moon,

659
00:51:22,498 --> 00:51:25,168
you can see a bright
outline around it.

660
00:51:26,402 --> 00:51:29,804
That outline
is called hala.

661
00:51:29,806 --> 00:51:33,244
My wife was named
for that light.

662
00:51:42,418 --> 00:51:44,219
- Here.
- This is too much.

663
00:51:44,221 --> 00:51:46,454
Don't argue with me.

664
00:51:46,456 --> 00:51:47,692
Thank you.

665
00:51:59,268 --> 00:52:02,938
Stop it, Zaki.
Can I pull yours?

666
00:52:04,974 --> 00:52:07,809
Keep him quiet.
I'm trying to sleep.

667
00:52:07,811 --> 00:52:11,713
- What's the matter with you?
- Why don't you tell Zaki a story, hmm?

668
00:52:11,715 --> 00:52:13,414
We'd all like that.

669
00:52:13,416 --> 00:52:16,784
Well, Zaki, do you want to know
what happened to the boy?

670
00:52:18,487 --> 00:52:20,755
Yes, yes,
and the elephant.

671
00:52:22,326 --> 00:52:26,628
The boy ran and ran, his
heart beating fast in fear.

672
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:29,798
<i>And the thing that chased him
never stopped.</i>

673
00:52:32,568 --> 00:52:36,373
<i>So the boy hid behind a tree
and he waited for courage.</i>

674
00:52:43,746 --> 00:52:46,981
<i>An ancient woman
had been trying to milk a goat,</i>

675
00:52:46,983 --> 00:52:49,416
<i>but her back was very sore.</i>

676
00:52:49,418 --> 00:52:54,856
My back is very sore.

677
00:52:54,858 --> 00:52:59,494
<i>The boy took pity on her and told her
to rest under the shade of a tree</i>

678
00:52:59,496 --> 00:53:01,563
<i>and he would do
the milking instead.</i>

679
00:53:01,565 --> 00:53:03,664
Please sit under
the shade of this tree,

680
00:53:03,666 --> 00:53:06,337
and I will do
the milking instead.

681
00:53:13,576 --> 00:53:15,610
<i>When he finished
milking the goat,</i>

682
00:53:15,612 --> 00:53:18,713
<i>the old woman shared
the lovely, warm milk with him.</i>

683
00:53:18,715 --> 00:53:22,684
<i>It was the nicest milk he had ever tasted,</i>

684
00:53:22,686 --> 00:53:25,353
<i>and he complimented the woman
on her goats.</i>

685
00:53:25,355 --> 00:53:27,554
Your goats
are very generous.

686
00:53:27,556 --> 00:53:30,791
<i>In return, the old woman
gave him a mirror.</i>

687
00:53:30,793 --> 00:53:34,996
See how it shines!

688
00:53:34,998 --> 00:53:37,499
<i>The boy was delighted
with the mirror,</i>

689
00:53:37,501 --> 00:53:42,607
<i>but as he looked into it, he saw the
reflection of the thing that followed him!</i>

690
00:53:46,909 --> 00:53:48,575
What are you doing,
Mama-jan?

691
00:53:48,577 --> 00:53:51,378
I'm laying out
Soraya's good clothes.

692
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,715
Am I to sell them
at the market?

693
00:53:53,717 --> 00:53:56,721
Shh, shh, shh, Parvana.
It's time to sleep.

694
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:08,496
I just need to find
a way to get to Peshawar,

695
00:54:08,498 --> 00:54:10,632
and I can figure it out
from there.

696
00:54:10,634 --> 00:54:13,034
I think there's
a beach in Goa

697
00:54:13,036 --> 00:54:15,403
where the tourists
are very rich.

698
00:54:15,405 --> 00:54:17,604
If they're rich, they
would buy my blue stones,

699
00:54:17,606 --> 00:54:20,941
and that's where I'd set up my
business, and you could join me.

700
00:54:20,943 --> 00:54:23,077
Once I find Baba.

701
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:25,415
Once you find your Baba.

702
00:54:44,668 --> 00:54:45,967
100.

703
00:54:45,969 --> 00:54:47,469
I'll give you 85.

704
00:54:47,471 --> 00:54:48,702
- Ninety.
- Eighty-two.

705
00:54:48,704 --> 00:54:50,704
Eighty-five,
and that's final.

706
00:54:50,706 --> 00:54:53,344
Eighty-five and a bunch of
grapes, and that's final.

707
00:54:58,114 --> 00:55:02,583
You're leaning too hard on the
pen, but your writing is good.

708
00:55:02,585 --> 00:55:05,355
If you try it more gently,
it'll be easier.

709
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:44,528
Wait!
Wait a moment!

710
00:55:46,163 --> 00:55:48,028
What is it, child?

711
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:51,733
You asked me before about the man who
used to sit there... the teacher.

712
00:55:51,735 --> 00:55:54,869
- Your uncle?
- He didn't go to Mazar-e-Sharif.

713
00:55:54,871 --> 00:55:58,039
He was taken to prison.
But he did nothing wrong.

714
00:55:58,041 --> 00:55:59,606
- Which one?
- What?

715
00:55:59,608 --> 00:56:01,909
- Which prison?
- Pul-e-Charkhi.

716
00:56:01,911 --> 00:56:05,448
It's been weeks now, and my
family has had no word of him.

717
00:56:07,516 --> 00:56:09,483
Go to the prison
on Wednesday.

718
00:56:09,485 --> 00:56:11,152
Ask for Roshan.
He's my cousin.

719
00:56:11,154 --> 00:56:14,724
Tell him Razaq sent you and
he will help you, if he can.

720
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:42,550
Deliwar!

721
00:56:42,552 --> 00:56:48,056
With work like this, I'll be an old
woman by the time I get to the sea.

722
00:56:48,058 --> 00:56:50,891
Or an old man.

723
00:56:56,099 --> 00:57:00,200
You sit and rest, Deliwar,
and I'll tell you a story.

724
00:57:00,202 --> 00:57:03,474
- A story?
- Yes, a story.

725
00:57:04,574 --> 00:57:06,139
One time
in the deep past,

726
00:57:06,141 --> 00:57:10,711
there was a boy who had to return a stolen
bag of precious seeds to his village.

727
00:57:10,713 --> 00:57:14,148
Is it a happy story
or a sad story?

728
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:16,454
Just wait and see.

729
00:57:17,786 --> 00:57:20,822
The boy had been told
he needed three things

730
00:57:20,824 --> 00:57:23,992
in order to overcome
the Elephant King...

731
00:57:23,994 --> 00:57:27,862
something that shines, something
that ensnares and something that...

732
00:57:27,864 --> 00:57:30,733
Hey, you two! Come here!

733
00:57:32,101 --> 00:57:33,934
Come on!

734
00:57:33,936 --> 00:57:35,536
I know that boy.

735
00:57:35,538 --> 00:57:38,072
Hurry up. Come here.

736
00:57:38,074 --> 00:57:39,706
Come on.

737
00:57:39,708 --> 00:57:42,512
We'd better do
what we're told.

738
00:57:45,614 --> 00:57:47,650
Get a move on,
lazy kids.

739
00:57:55,858 --> 00:57:57,891
So these are
the new workers?

740
00:57:57,893 --> 00:58:00,762
Where are your tongues? Are you stupid?

741
00:58:00,764 --> 00:58:03,965
Idrees suggested we have a
little arm-wrestling match.

742
00:58:04,967 --> 00:58:08,068
To see if you're strong
enough to work for me.

743
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:10,704
I saw you sitting down
over there instead of working.

744
00:58:10,706 --> 00:58:12,706
Idrees, stop now.

745
00:58:12,708 --> 00:58:14,675
Make me some tea.

746
00:58:18,648 --> 00:58:21,583
Let me see how feeble
<i>you</i> are, little one.

747
00:58:22,851 --> 00:58:25,121
He can't even
lift his hand.

748
00:58:26,755 --> 00:58:29,058
Get up and make us tea.

749
00:58:30,326 --> 00:58:33,795
Uncle, I think
you need new workers.

750
00:58:33,797 --> 00:58:36,664
- These ones are no good.
- Enough, Idrees.

751
00:58:36,666 --> 00:58:38,298
Leave the poor kids alone.

752
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:40,804
They are
a little undercooked.

753
00:58:44,641 --> 00:58:46,940
I know you.

754
00:58:46,942 --> 00:58:49,145
You're the teacher's daugh...

755
00:58:54,617 --> 00:58:56,751
Idrees.

756
00:58:56,753 --> 00:58:58,753
Bring the gun back!

757
00:58:58,755 --> 00:59:00,787
I said
bring the gun back!

758
00:59:00,789 --> 00:59:03,693
Idrees!

759
00:59:22,112 --> 00:59:23,911
Come out now!

760
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:29,282
Come out now!

761
00:59:29,284 --> 00:59:32,589
Idrees, it has begun!
We are moving west.

762
00:59:33,657 --> 00:59:36,423
We have been given orders
to go immediately!

763
00:59:36,425 --> 00:59:38,659
I know who you are!

764
00:59:38,661 --> 00:59:40,163
Do you hear?

765
00:59:41,264 --> 00:59:43,364
Get up here! Come on!

766
00:59:45,101 --> 00:59:47,738
Right now!
You little coward!

767
00:59:49,773 --> 00:59:53,744
You want to fight? Now
is your chance to fight!

768
00:59:55,712 --> 00:59:57,114
You become a man.

769
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:22,369
He's gone.

770
01:00:22,371 --> 01:00:24,438
What if he comes back?

771
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,740
He'd be lucky.

772
01:00:26,742 --> 01:00:28,309
Where are we?

773
01:00:28,311 --> 01:00:30,711
I came here once
when I ran away.

774
01:00:30,713 --> 01:00:34,784
I think the way in has gotten
smaller or I have gotten bigger.

775
01:00:35,485 --> 01:00:37,253
It looks old.

776
01:00:38,154 --> 01:00:39,820
I lost a shoe.

777
01:00:39,822 --> 01:00:43,324
I lost my cap, although
I think it's outside.

778
01:00:43,326 --> 01:00:45,161
Why did you hit him?

779
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:50,233
When they took my father,
he was one of them.

780
01:00:52,367 --> 01:00:54,101
Tell me more
about the boy.

781
01:00:54,103 --> 01:00:55,802
What boy?

782
01:00:55,804 --> 01:00:57,771
The story boy.

783
01:00:57,773 --> 01:01:00,507
The boy was cold.

784
01:01:00,509 --> 01:01:04,112
<i>Though the sun burned in
the sky, it gave no heat.</i>

785
01:01:04,114 --> 01:01:07,115
<i>But he had a
warm hat and a big coat.</i>

786
01:01:07,117 --> 01:01:08,849
<i>No, he didn't.</i>

787
01:01:08,851 --> 01:01:11,318
<i>He had already found
one of the three things...</i>

788
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,220
<i>a mirror that shone.</i>

789
01:01:13,222 --> 01:01:16,858
<i>But when he looked at it,
he saw something behind him.</i>

790
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:19,527
<i>Something scary.
Something dreadful!</i>

791
01:01:19,529 --> 01:01:22,496
<i>- A horse!
- No, Shauzia, not a horse.</i>

792
01:01:22,498 --> 01:01:24,398
<i>Yes, it was.</i>

793
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:28,001
<i>And it was a very old horse whose bones
clattered together when it walked.</i>

794
01:01:28,003 --> 01:01:31,239
<i>It wasn't scary at all.</i>

795
01:01:31,241 --> 01:01:35,543
<i>Fine. The boy felt sad for the
old horse and fed him hay.</i>

796
01:01:35,545 --> 01:01:37,512
<i>And they all lived
happily ever after.</i>

797
01:01:37,514 --> 01:01:40,248
<i>It's the middle of the
story, not the end!</i>

798
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:43,016
<i>From a door carved
into the stone,</i>

799
01:01:43,018 --> 01:01:45,318
<i>out came a round man.</i>

800
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:49,389
You wasted my hay on an old
horse that will soon be dead!

801
01:01:49,391 --> 01:01:52,492
<i>The round man threw the boy deep
into the belly of an ancient well.</i>

802
01:01:52,494 --> 01:01:55,098
Aaah!

803
01:01:56,366 --> 01:01:58,999
<i>At the bottom of the well
there were emeralds,</i>

804
01:01:59,001 --> 01:02:03,070
<i>and the round man wanted them brought up
to him as payment for the wasted hay.</i>

805
01:02:03,072 --> 01:02:05,438
You will bring
the emeralds to me.

806
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,474
<i>- What's his name?
- The round man?</i>

807
01:02:07,476 --> 01:02:09,242
No, the boy.

808
01:02:09,244 --> 01:02:12,479
You can't have a story about a
boy and not give him a name.

809
01:02:12,481 --> 01:02:14,414
Give him a name
before I do.

810
01:02:14,416 --> 01:02:16,284
Sulayman.

811
01:02:16,286 --> 01:02:18,789
His name is Sulayman.

812
01:02:19,422 --> 01:02:21,255
That's a good name.

813
01:02:21,257 --> 01:02:24,224
Sulayman lay
at the bottom of the well.

814
01:02:24,226 --> 01:02:27,327
<i>Suddenly, he could see skeletons.</i>

815
01:02:27,329 --> 01:02:32,166
<i>Three skeletons, each with an
emerald clutched in its bony hands.</i>

816
01:02:32,168 --> 01:02:34,001
- <i>He called out for help.</i>
- Help!

817
01:02:34,003 --> 01:02:37,137
<i>The poor old horse looked
back at him from way above.</i>

818
01:02:37,139 --> 01:02:40,041
<i>But the horse did
something extraordinary.</i>

819
01:02:40,043 --> 01:02:42,976
<i>He neighed with the voice
of all the world's animals.</i>

820
01:02:52,621 --> 01:02:55,923
<i>Sulayman climbed up, up,
all the way to the top,</i>

821
01:02:55,925 --> 01:02:58,291
<i>and he thanked the horse
for saving his life.</i>

822
01:02:58,293 --> 01:03:01,130
Thank you for saving my life.

823
01:03:06,001 --> 01:03:08,469
<i>Sulayman had just
three emeralds with him...</i>

824
01:03:08,471 --> 01:03:11,472
<i>And asked the round man for food in return.</i>

825
01:03:11,474 --> 01:03:13,206
<i>He was hungry.</i>

826
01:03:13,208 --> 01:03:15,476
<i>But the round man
was wicked and cheap.</i>

827
01:03:15,478 --> 01:03:19,347
<i>He threw a fishing net at Sulayman
and he told him to get his own food.</i>

828
01:03:19,349 --> 01:03:22,617
- <i>That was exactly what Sulayman needed.</i>
- Ha-ha!

829
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:25,019
<i>Something that ensnares.</i>

830
01:03:25,021 --> 01:03:26,621
<i>But as Sulayman left,</i>

831
01:03:26,623 --> 01:03:30,358
<i>the ghosts of the three skeletons
came out of the three emeralds</i>

832
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,327
<i>and swirled and twirled
and scared the round man</i>

833
01:03:33,329 --> 01:03:36,630
<i>in frightful vengeance for
having lost them their lives.</i>

834
01:03:40,904 --> 01:03:44,537
<i>Sulayman and the horse continued
their journey toward the mountain,</i>

835
01:03:44,539 --> 01:03:48,041
<i>but the horse was getting
slower and slower.</i>

836
01:03:48,043 --> 01:03:51,411
<i>He needed to rest,
being very, very old,</i>

837
01:03:51,413 --> 01:03:54,315
<i>and so Sulayman made a
shelter for the horse</i>

838
01:03:54,317 --> 01:03:57,018
<i>and told him
to wait for him.</i>

839
01:03:57,020 --> 01:03:59,387
<i>The horse protested...</i>

840
01:03:59,389 --> 01:04:03,324
<i>but Sulayman knew he had to face
the Elephant King and the jaguars</i>

841
01:04:03,326 --> 01:04:04,958
<i>all by himself.</i>

842
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,996
I will see you again,
old horse.

843
01:04:09,197 --> 01:04:11,268
<i>And so on he went alone.</i>

844
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:26,012
Tomorrow is Wednesday.

845
01:04:26,014 --> 01:04:29,018
I'm going back there,
to the prison.

846
01:04:30,619 --> 01:04:32,955
They'll have to
let me see him then.

847
01:04:54,143 --> 01:04:56,177
From now on,
you're staying inside.

848
01:04:56,179 --> 01:04:58,445
- It's much too dangerous.
- No, Mama-jan.

849
01:04:58,447 --> 01:05:00,648
- We manage all right out there.
- "We"?

850
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:04,585
Me and Deliwar. She's a girl too.
We work together.

851
01:05:04,587 --> 01:05:08,322
We've written to my cousin to arrange
a marriage for your sister in Mazar.

852
01:05:08,324 --> 01:05:10,458
They wrote back,
and it was accepted.

853
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:13,327
Someone will come for us the day
after tomorrow to take us away.

854
01:05:13,329 --> 01:05:15,228
- You don't need to do this anymore.
- What?

855
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:17,231
We can't go on
like this.

856
01:05:17,233 --> 01:05:19,733
- We can't depend on you to keep us alive.
- Why?

857
01:05:19,735 --> 01:05:21,601
I provide for you
just fine.

858
01:05:21,603 --> 01:05:23,771
It's not the job of a child.

859
01:05:23,773 --> 01:05:26,307
How can we leave
without Baba?

860
01:05:26,309 --> 01:05:28,775
Every day you come home
with cuts and blisters.

861
01:05:28,777 --> 01:05:32,481
Every day you go out there, and I don't
know if I'll see you back again.

862
01:05:33,616 --> 01:05:35,615
I can't lose you too.

863
01:05:35,617 --> 01:05:37,617
I'm not going.

864
01:05:37,619 --> 01:05:40,688
Baba could come back, and no one
will be here waiting for him.

865
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:43,124
So how long
should we wait?

866
01:05:43,126 --> 01:05:45,559
Until you're found out
and taken away from me?

867
01:05:45,561 --> 01:05:47,795
Until I have to send Zaki out
to earn our keep?

868
01:05:47,797 --> 01:05:50,097
Let me go see him
before we leave.

869
01:05:50,099 --> 01:05:52,298
Let me tell him
where we are going.

870
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,702
- Parvana!
- Let me bring him his walking stick.

871
01:05:54,704 --> 01:05:56,436
Then I will go with you.

872
01:05:56,438 --> 01:06:00,374
Then I will be a good sister
and a good daughter.

873
01:06:00,376 --> 01:06:01,979
I promise.

874
01:06:02,779 --> 01:06:04,380
I promise.

875
01:06:19,462 --> 01:06:21,128
Please don't go.

876
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:23,697
Please, it is much
too dangerous now.

877
01:06:23,699 --> 01:06:26,266
Mama-jan, I'm going.

878
01:06:26,268 --> 01:06:28,135
I'll be back tonight
before curfew.

879
01:06:28,137 --> 01:06:30,670
- No, Sulayman.
- Mama-jan.

880
01:06:30,672 --> 01:06:34,141
- You won't come back.
- Let her go now.

881
01:06:34,143 --> 01:06:36,279
Let Parvana go.

882
01:06:43,485 --> 01:06:45,422
Oh!

883
01:06:52,327 --> 01:06:54,431
Parvana.

884
01:07:30,465 --> 01:07:32,101
Deliwar!

885
01:07:33,536 --> 01:07:36,470
You frightened
me half to death.

886
01:07:36,472 --> 01:07:38,472
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

887
01:07:38,474 --> 01:07:41,407
Why? You want to work at the
chai shop with me this morning?

888
01:07:41,409 --> 01:07:45,311
- No, I can't.
- Hey, you want some candy for Zaki?

889
01:07:45,313 --> 01:07:48,150
We are leaving Kabul
tomorrow.

890
01:07:49,751 --> 01:07:51,619
You are leaving me?

891
01:07:51,621 --> 01:07:54,755
It's been arranged.
There's nothing I can do.

892
01:07:54,757 --> 01:07:58,893
My sister is getting
married in Mazar-e-Sharif.

893
01:07:58,895 --> 01:08:00,494
I'm going back
to the prison.

894
01:08:00,496 --> 01:08:02,496
I found someone
who can help me,

895
01:08:02,498 --> 01:08:04,731
and I need to get more money
to bribe the guard.

896
01:08:04,733 --> 01:08:06,633
I'll need it today.

897
01:08:06,635 --> 01:08:09,802
You'll just get another punch in the guts.
It's a stupid idea.

898
01:08:09,804 --> 01:08:11,639
I won't let that happen
this time.

899
01:08:11,641 --> 01:08:14,775
- I said it's a stupid idea.
- Please help me.

900
01:08:14,777 --> 01:08:16,644
What do you want me to do?

901
01:08:16,646 --> 01:08:19,913
Magic some money into your hand
like in your kids' stories?

902
01:08:19,915 --> 01:08:22,615
It doesn't work like that,
Parvana.

903
01:08:22,617 --> 01:08:24,585
I can't help you.

904
01:08:24,587 --> 01:08:28,689
Now run away to Mazar-e-Sharif
and have a nice wedding party.

905
01:08:28,691 --> 01:08:32,792
Maybe they'll find a husband for you
too and your troubles will be over.

906
01:08:32,794 --> 01:08:35,229
Until after the wedding,
at least.

907
01:08:35,231 --> 01:08:36,666
You fool!

908
01:08:39,802 --> 01:08:41,471
Deliwar!

909
01:08:42,538 --> 01:08:44,174
Shauzia.

910
01:08:52,682 --> 01:08:54,814
Shauzia.

911
01:08:54,816 --> 01:08:56,749
Come with us.

912
01:08:56,751 --> 01:08:59,286
I can't.

913
01:08:59,288 --> 01:09:02,424
My father would come all the
way to Mazar to kill me.

914
01:09:04,293 --> 01:09:07,297
I can't leave Kabul,
Parvana, not like this.

915
01:09:09,498 --> 01:09:12,233
- Here, take this.
- I can't take your money.

916
01:09:12,235 --> 01:09:14,204
Please take it.

917
01:09:17,306 --> 01:09:19,707
Go and see your Baba.

918
01:09:19,709 --> 01:09:23,777
Tell him that his daughter
is a good daughter.

919
01:09:23,779 --> 01:09:27,450
Tell him
that Deliwar said so.

920
01:09:33,723 --> 01:09:36,457
Hey, Deliwar.

921
01:09:36,459 --> 01:09:38,591
What?

922
01:09:38,593 --> 01:09:41,328
I'll meet you at that beach
you were talking about,

923
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:43,997
where the moon
pulls the water,

924
01:09:43,999 --> 01:09:45,899
20 years from today.

925
01:09:45,901 --> 01:09:49,036
I don't think I'll
recognize you then, Aatish.

926
01:09:49,038 --> 01:09:53,242
Well, you can sell me some pretty
blue stones for a great price.

927
01:09:55,277 --> 01:09:57,347
Until next time then.

928
01:10:00,348 --> 01:10:02,615
Until next time.

929
01:10:20,669 --> 01:10:22,903
Peace be upon you.
Are you Fattema?

930
01:10:22,905 --> 01:10:24,104
Yes, I am Fattema.

931
01:10:24,106 --> 01:10:27,373
I am your second cousin. Mohammed
Abdul sent me from Mazar.

932
01:10:27,375 --> 01:10:29,743
Gather your family.
We must leave immediately.

933
01:10:29,745 --> 01:10:33,514
No, you see, you weren't
supposed to come so soon.

934
01:10:33,516 --> 01:10:36,050
My son is away. We must
wait for him to return.

935
01:10:36,052 --> 01:10:37,818
There is a war coming.
Have you not heard?

936
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:39,920
We have to leave now
before they block the roads.

937
01:10:39,922 --> 01:10:42,689
We have to wait until she comes home.
I have to wait for my daughter.

938
01:10:42,691 --> 01:10:44,992
Son? Daughter? Which is it?

939
01:10:44,994 --> 01:10:46,859
Gather your things.
We are leaving now!

940
01:10:46,861 --> 01:10:49,762
I'm not leaving without Parvana.
We have to wait.

941
01:10:49,764 --> 01:10:51,765
Count yourself lucky
I'm taking you, old woman.

942
01:10:51,767 --> 01:10:53,766
The girl and the baby
are of more worth.

943
01:10:53,768 --> 01:10:55,668
I didn't come all this way
for nothing.

944
01:10:55,670 --> 01:10:58,105
If we do not go now, we won't
get out of here at all.

945
01:10:58,107 --> 01:11:00,640
- My baby! Give him to me!
- Let's go! Argh!

946
01:11:00,642 --> 01:11:02,544
Zaki! Zaki!

947
01:11:03,579 --> 01:11:06,113
Give me my baby.
Give him to me!

948
01:11:06,115 --> 01:11:08,285
- No! Give him to me!
- Let go! Let go!

949
01:11:23,432 --> 01:11:25,698
- Salaam, little one.
- Salaam.

950
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:29,002
Where are you going to
with an old man's stick?

951
01:11:29,004 --> 01:11:31,605
It belongs to my Baba.

952
01:11:31,607 --> 01:11:34,577
I'm taking it to him,
to the prison.

953
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:37,347
I see.

954
01:11:38,114 --> 01:11:40,349
We're going that way.

955
01:11:47,522 --> 01:11:49,155
Give me my baby!

956
01:11:49,157 --> 01:11:52,693
- Let's go! If you want to keep the baby, come with me!
- Zaki!

957
01:11:52,695 --> 01:11:54,728
My daughter
is out there.

958
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:57,131
Then what kind of fool are you
to have sent her out alone?

959
01:11:57,133 --> 01:12:00,033
Get in, or she won't be the
only child you'll lose today!

960
01:12:00,035 --> 01:12:02,836
Don't...
Give me my baby!

961
01:12:02,838 --> 01:12:04,738
Keep him quiet!

962
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:06,707
I am begging you.

963
01:12:06,709 --> 01:12:11,614
Wait for my daughter!

964
01:12:58,827 --> 01:13:02,061
Come, Soraya.
We must start a fire.

965
01:13:03,865 --> 01:13:05,666
I am looking for Roshan.

966
01:13:05,668 --> 01:13:08,001
Hey!
I am looking for Roshan.

967
01:13:08,003 --> 01:13:11,471
I am looking for Roshan.
I am looking for Roshan.

968
01:13:11,473 --> 01:13:14,707
I am looking for Roshan.
I am looking for Roshan.

969
01:13:14,709 --> 01:13:16,909
- Open the door!
- Get away from the door, you stupid kid!

970
01:13:16,911 --> 01:13:19,179
- I am looking for Roshan!
- Get out of here!

971
01:13:19,181 --> 01:13:21,148
- I am looking for Roshan!
- Are you stupid?

972
01:13:21,150 --> 01:13:22,748
- I am looking for Roshan.
- Shut up!

973
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:24,117
What are you doing here?

974
01:13:24,119 --> 01:13:27,054
It's all right.
He's my son.

975
01:13:27,056 --> 01:13:29,558
You're wanted inside.

976
01:13:31,259 --> 01:13:33,193
That boy needs
some discipline.

977
01:13:33,195 --> 01:13:34,998
That's my business.

978
01:13:37,967 --> 01:13:41,768
What in the name of the
merciful are you doing here?

979
01:13:41,770 --> 01:13:45,238
It's Wednesday. I've come
to meet your cousin Roshan.

980
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,508
There's a war started.

981
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:50,644
Roshan has gone to fight.

982
01:13:50,646 --> 01:13:54,918
We've been brought from the city to clear the
prison of anyone who won't fight for us.

983
01:13:56,151 --> 01:13:57,950
- The teacher...
- Is he alive?

984
01:13:57,952 --> 01:13:59,619
I don't know.

985
01:13:59,621 --> 01:14:03,726
The teacher is my father.
I am Parvana, his daughter.

986
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:07,530
Help him, please.

987
01:14:09,764 --> 01:14:12,899
If I'm not back before the
sun has gone down, you run.

988
01:14:12,901 --> 01:14:16,670
Run as far away as you can from
here and you keep on running.

989
01:14:16,672 --> 01:14:19,038
You can't stay here after sunset.
Do you understand?

990
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,573
- Thank you.
- Do you understand?

991
01:14:20,575 --> 01:14:22,708
- Yes.
- Hide yourself until then.

992
01:14:34,656 --> 01:14:38,758
Once there was a young boy
called Sulayman.

993
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:41,728
He knew his heart was fated
to serve his people,

994
01:14:41,730 --> 01:14:43,766
and he was running
out of time.

995
01:14:52,674 --> 01:14:56,176
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

996
01:14:56,178 --> 01:14:59,712
- Come on! Get in the car.
- We have to go back for my daughter.

997
01:14:59,714 --> 01:15:02,518
I said come here. Now!

998
01:15:03,184 --> 01:15:05,118
We're not going with you.

999
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,920
Mama-jan?

1000
01:15:06,922 --> 01:15:10,023
You, come now!
Do you hear me?

1001
01:15:10,025 --> 01:15:13,795
You come here like I told you to!

1002
01:15:14,996 --> 01:15:17,799
You come now!

1003
01:15:18,933 --> 01:15:22,668
We will not go with you.
Just drive away from us.

1004
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:26,006
Get in the car.
Get in the car now!

1005
01:15:26,008 --> 01:15:28,144
Mama-jan!

1006
01:15:32,647 --> 01:15:35,817
Sulayman! Sulayman!

1007
01:15:37,352 --> 01:15:39,688
Be brave, Sulayman.

1008
01:16:30,172 --> 01:16:31,938
Run, Soraya.

1009
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:34,140
- Take Zaki and run now!
- Mama!

1010
01:16:34,142 --> 01:16:36,178
Go! Keep running!

1011
01:16:40,848 --> 01:16:44,886
You... let... us... go.

1012
01:16:55,464 --> 01:16:57,363
Open the door.

1013
01:16:57,365 --> 01:16:58,832
What are you doing
with that?

1014
01:16:58,834 --> 01:17:02,639
He's dead. I'm putting him with the others.
Open the door. Let me through.

1015
01:17:17,452 --> 01:17:19,152
- Move, move, move, move, move!
- Stop!

1016
01:17:19,154 --> 01:17:22,722
- Line up. All of you, all of you.
- Stop!

1017
01:17:22,724 --> 01:17:24,291
I said stop!

1018
01:17:24,293 --> 01:17:26,460
It will be dark soon.

1019
01:17:26,462 --> 01:17:29,061
Razaq?

1020
01:17:29,063 --> 01:17:31,064
Razaq? Razaq?

1021
01:17:42,443 --> 01:17:44,411
Sulayman.

1022
01:17:44,413 --> 01:17:46,683
Sulayman.

1023
01:17:47,215 --> 01:17:48,481
<i>The mirror shines!</i>

1024
01:17:48,483 --> 01:17:50,820
<i>Use it to blind the jaguars!</i>

1025
01:18:03,132 --> 01:18:06,233
<i>The net ensnares!
Throw it over them!</i>

1026
01:18:06,235 --> 01:18:08,705
Hah!

1027
01:18:43,571 --> 01:18:46,038
Razaq. Razaq!

1028
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:48,874
Razaq! I have come
for my father.

1029
01:18:48,876 --> 01:18:50,780
I have come for my Baba!

1030
01:18:51,413 --> 01:18:53,913
Put him down!

1031
01:18:53,915 --> 01:18:56,017
I said put him down.

1032
01:19:01,389 --> 01:19:04,024
Do you see
what is happening?

1033
01:19:04,026 --> 01:19:07,260
Where are you taking him?
Who's out there?

1034
01:19:07,262 --> 01:19:09,863
Look away, can't you?

1035
01:19:09,865 --> 01:19:12,034
It is just one man.
What does it matter?

1036
01:19:15,838 --> 01:19:18,438
Go.

1037
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:20,239
Go!

1038
01:19:20,241 --> 01:19:22,175
Go, unless you're going
to kill me.

1039
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:28,547
I will scream and curse you

1040
01:19:28,549 --> 01:19:32,551
until the last breath
leaves my body.

1041
01:19:32,553 --> 01:19:34,257
Go.

1042
01:19:37,491 --> 01:19:40,329
You're crazy. Crazy.

1043
01:19:41,929 --> 01:19:44,166
You can die out here
for all I care.

1044
01:19:44,599 --> 01:19:45,931
Die.

1045
01:20:09,590 --> 01:20:11,360
Sulayman.

1046
01:20:12,427 --> 01:20:14,030
Sulayman.

1047
01:20:15,230 --> 01:20:16,496
Sulayman.

1048
01:20:23,672 --> 01:20:26,107
I have not come
to kill you.

1049
01:20:36,919 --> 01:20:38,652
<i>Sulayman!</i>

1050
01:20:38,654 --> 01:20:40,386
<i>Soothe him with your story,</i>

1051
01:20:40,388 --> 01:20:43,189
<i>the one that Mama-jan
can't speak of.</i>

1052
01:20:43,191 --> 01:20:44,623
<i>Tell him.</i>

1053
01:20:44,625 --> 01:20:46,525
<i>Sulayman!</i>

1054
01:20:46,527 --> 01:20:48,528
My name is Sulayman.

1055
01:20:48,530 --> 01:20:50,630
<i>Tell him what happened.</i>

1056
01:20:50,632 --> 01:20:53,300
<i>Tell him your story.</i>

1057
01:20:53,302 --> 01:20:54,667
My name is Sulayman.

1058
01:20:54,669 --> 01:20:56,970
My mother is a writer.

1059
01:20:56,972 --> 01:20:58,704
My father is a teacher.

1060
01:20:58,706 --> 01:21:02,242
And my sisters
always fight each other.

1061
01:21:02,244 --> 01:21:04,644
One day I found
a toy on the street.

1062
01:21:04,646 --> 01:21:06,613
I picked it up.

1063
01:21:06,615 --> 01:21:08,347
It exploded.

1064
01:21:10,052 --> 01:21:12,685
I don't remember
what happened after that

1065
01:21:12,687 --> 01:21:14,487
because it was the end.

1066
01:21:14,489 --> 01:21:17,524
<i>It's working, Sulayman!
Tell him. Tell him!</i>

1067
01:21:17,526 --> 01:21:20,060
My name is Sulayman.

1068
01:21:20,062 --> 01:21:22,028
My mother is a writer.

1069

I picked it up.

1073
01:21:31,239 --> 01:21:32,474
It exploded.

1074
01:21:39,313 --> 01:21:41,116
It was the end.

1075
01:21:42,483 --> 01:21:44,053
My name is Sulayman.

01:21:54,329 --> 01:21:55,761

<i>The Elephant was transformed.</i>

1086
01:22:09,343 --> 01:22:11,744
<i>He took the bag of seed
from the center of the mountain</i>

1087
01:22:11,746 --> 01:22:14,314
<i>and gave it back to Sulayman.</i>

1088
01:22:14,316 --> 01:22:17,316
<i>Sulayman returned
to his village.</i>

1089
01:22:17,318 --> 01:22:20,552
<i>There was much dancing
and singing</i>

1090
01:22:20,554 --> 01:22:23,124
<i>and laughing and eating.</i>

1091
01:22:30,565 --> 01:22:32,233
Razaq?

1092
01:22:38,473 --> 01:22:39,738
Baba?

1093
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:42,377
Baba!
Is he alive?

1094
01:22:43,779 --> 01:22:47,279
It is not his blood.
He lives.

1095
01:23:07,701 --> 01:23:10,470
Get out of here now,
child. Go on.

1096
01:23:10,472 --> 01:23:13,142
As fast as you can.

1097
01:24:16,838 --> 01:24:18,637
It's the moon.

1098
01:24:25,847 --> 01:24:27,483
Soraya.

1099
01:24:28,415 --> 01:24:31,618
S... Sora... Soraya!

1100
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:33,853
- Mama?
- Soraya!

1101
01:24:33,855 --> 01:24:36,221
So...

1102
01:24:40,829 --> 01:24:45,134
<i>We are a land whose
people are its greatest treasure.</i>

1103
01:24:49,504 --> 01:24:53,509
<i>We are at the edges of empires
at war with each other.</i>

1104
01:24:55,843 --> 01:24:57,480
Par...

1105
01:24:59,513 --> 01:25:01,449
Parvana.

1106
01:25:03,218 --> 01:25:07,554
We are a fractured land in the
claws of the Hindu Kush mountains,

1107
01:25:07,556 --> 01:25:11,126
scorched by the fiery eyes
of the northern deserts.

1108
01:25:12,427 --> 01:25:16,598
Black rubble earth
against ice peaks.

1109
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:21,667
<i>We are</i> Ariana,

1110
01:25:21,669 --> 01:25:24,606
<i>the land of the noble.</i>

1111
01:25:25,973 --> 01:25:29,609
<i>Raise your
words, not your voice.</i>

1112
01:25:29,611 --> 01:25:32,811
<i>It is rain
that makes the flowers grow,</i>

1113
01:25:32,813 --> 01:25:35,217
<i>not thunder.</i>
