帕尔瓦娜
Parvana.

13
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,610
我们家能拿得出手来卖的只有这件了
It's the only thing of value we have left.

14
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,550
我都没穿过 一次都没有
I never wore it. Not even once.

15
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,980
在我们国家 你哪有机会穿这裙子呢？ 帕尔瓦娜
Where would you wear it, Parvana?

16
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,690
- 还是继续学习吧 好不好？ - 好吧 爸爸
- Let's continue your studies. All right? - Yes, Baba.

17
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,820
那好 关于丝绸之路 你了解多少？
Now, what can you tell me about the Silk Road?

18
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,560
丝绸之路
The Silk Road.

19
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,330
爸爸 我记不起丝绸之路的相关知识了
Baba, I can't remember about the Silk Road.

20
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,930
或许我们可以把这当成一个故事来记
Maybe if we think of it like a story.

21
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,700
即使我们一无所有 故事也总能记在心间
Stories remain in our hearts even when all else is gone.

22
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,540
自我们的文明伊始 我们的人民就开始讲故事了
Our people have always told stories, from our very beginning,

23
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,780
那时我们的家乡叫作帕提亚和霍拉桑
when we were Parthia and Khorasan.

24
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,450
我们的家园在兴都库什山脉的利爪下被分成数个部分
A fractured land in the claws of the Hindu Kush mountains,

25
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,650
有北部沙漠那炽烈之眼的灼热
scorched by the fiery eyes of the Northern Deserts,

26
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,690
亦包括那黑白交汇的冰峰之凛冽
black rubble earth against ice peaks.

27
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:06,730
我们的家园就如一个凶兽的骨架
Our land was the petrified skeleton of a monster.

28
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,460
我们的家园叫阿里亚纳
We were Ariana,

29
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,940
是高尚与荣耀之乡
the land of the noble and honorable.

30
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,140
我们可谓是世界交通的枢纽
We were a pathway to everywhere,

31
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,810
让东西方可互通有无
carrying goods from east to west.

32
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,680
我们研究星象
We studied the stars

33
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,880
在混乱的星空中寻找规律
and began to see order amidst the chaos.

34
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,950
我们的人民中涌现许多科学家 哲学家和故事传唱人
We were scientists, philosophers, and storytellers.

35
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,620
为解答疑惑而探求真知
Questions sought answers and then more questions.

36
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,120
我们开始了解宇宙中我们的位置
We began to see our place in the universe.

37
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,830
但我们处于两个交战国的边境交汇处
But we were at the edges of empires at war with each other,

38
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,660
数千年以来
as borders were defined and redefined...

39
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,640
边境无数次被重新界定
over thousands of years.

40
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,740
无数统治者在此开战 有波斯的居鲁士二世大帝
Of these mighty rulers came Cyrus the Great of Persia.

41
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,550
还有马其顿王国的亚历山大大帝
Then Alexander the Great of Macedon.

42
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,880
有印度的孔雀王朝
There came the Mauryan Empire,

43
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,820
也有成吉思汗的铁骑
Genghis Khan,

44
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,190
还有好多好多
and so on and so on.

45
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,750
每次战争都血流成河
Each time there was bloodshed,

46
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,960
而每次战争也都会有幸存者
and each time there were survivors.

47
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,560
历史的轨迹不断地重复着
A pattern repeating itself endlessly.

48
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,900
帕尔瓦娜 我年轻的时候
When I was young, Parvana,

49
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,900
在这个城市里 我体验过和平的滋味
I knew what peace felt like, here in this city.

50
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,070
孩子们都会去读书 女人们也能上大学
Children went to school, women went to university.

51
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,880
这里成了世外桃源
All the empires forgot about us,

52
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,080
至少有那么一段时间是
for a while at least.

53
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,680
但好景不长
But it did not last.

54
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,550
我们的国土变得脆弱不堪
The ground became weak under our feet,

55
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,890
从未安定
always uncertain.

56
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,120
先是一场政变 又来了一次入侵
First came a coup d'état, then an invasion,

57
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,830
之后就是内战
then a civil war.

58
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,560
如此的混乱局面下
In the chaos,

59
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,700
有些人希望领袖可以恢复秩序
some looked to those who might restore order.

60
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,730
但那代价实在是太大了
But at a great cost.

61
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,100
我们给女性定下了严格的德行规范
We have determined specific dignity for women!

62
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,210
女人决不能外出 招惹不必要的关注
Women should not go outside and attract unnecessary attention!

63
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:03,740
如果女人向外人展露自己的容貌 她将受到伊斯兰教法的诅咒
If a woman shows herself, she will be cursed by the Islamic Sharia

64
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,150
永远也别想上天堂
and should never expect to go to heaven.

65
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,720
一切都变了 帕尔瓦娜
Everything changes, Parvana.

66
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,820
记录这些的故事提醒着我们
Stories remind us of that.

67
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,860
帕尔瓦娜 你到底有没有在听啊？
Parvana, were you listening at all?

68
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,130
我在听呢 爸爸
Yes, Baba.

69
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,000
要不你给我讲讲我们游牧民族的祖先
Why don't you tell me about our nomadic ancestors

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,540
和他们那些金山的事 好不好？
and their hills of gold?

71
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,900
好吧
Well?

72
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,670
2000年前
2,000 years ago...

73
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,740
- 然后呢？ - 2000年前...
- Yes? - 2,000 years ago...

74
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,880
有一位巴克特里亚王国公主
there was a Bactrian princess

75
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,320
她有一个王冠
who had a crown.

76
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,280
然后呢？
And?

77
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,150
- 然后...- 帕尔瓦娜？
- And... - Parvana?

78
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,620
走开 别碰我的东西
Away. Keep away from my things.

79
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,890
快走 我说快走 你这只蠢狗
Go away. I said go away, you silly dog!

80
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,830
嘿 你 你以为你在干什么？
Hey, you! What do you think you're doing?

81
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,090
这个女孩为什么乱喊？
Why is this girl shouting?

82
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,330
她只是个孩子 她无意引人注目
She is only a child. She meant nothing by it.

83
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,100
她就是在引人注意
She's drawing attention to herself!

84
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,670
她应该待在家里 而不是在市场抛头露面
She should be at home, not displaying herself in the market.

85
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:04,010
我家除了一个婴儿 没有男孩 我需要她帮我
I have no son at home, except an infant. I need my daughter to help me.

86
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,670
- 站起来 我们跟你说话呢 - 我是个残..
- Stand up when we talk to you. - I am a cr...

87
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,980
我说给我站起来
I said stand up!

88
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,850
- 我认得你 - 是的 伊德瑞斯
- I know you. - Yes, Idrees.

89
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,090
我以前给你上过课 你那时是个好学生
I was your teacher once. You were a good student.

90
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,990
你给我讲那堆没用的东西 浪费了我宝贵的时间
You wasted my time, teaching me things of no worth.

91
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,630
我已加入塔利班 现在是专杀伊斯兰敌人的战士
I have joined the Taliban and now I fight the enemies of Islam.

92
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:29,200
好吧 如果我也能算是敌人 那真主已经夺走了我的腿来惩罚我的罪
Well, if I am an enemy, then for my sins God has taken my leg.

93
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,070
老头 你敢嘲笑我？
Are you making fun of me, old man?

94
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,700
我在战争中失去了一条腿 那场我们并肩作战的战争
I lost my leg in the war. The war we fought together.

95
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,870
- 她多大了？- 伊德瑞斯
- How old is the girl? - Idrees.

96
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,840
- 她还是个孩子 - 她这岁数已经能嫁人了
- She is a child. - She's old enough to marry.

97
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,670
我也快要讨老婆了
I'll be looking for a wife soon.

98
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,680
她已经许配给别人了
She's already been promised to someone.

99
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,380
她得把自己裹好
Well, she should cover herself properly.

100
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,780
- 或许你该把眼睛从她身上拿开 - 你跟我说什么？
- Maybe you should stop looking at her. - What did you say to me?

101
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,950
我说你把你那双眼睛拿开
I said stop looking at her.

102
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,820
- 我杀了你 - 伊德瑞斯
- I can have you killed! - Idrees.

103
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,020
- 注意你的言辞 - 够了 走吧
- You watch what you say! - That's enough. Come on.

104
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,360
你还好吗？
Are you all right?

105
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,190
我没事 爸爸
Yes, Baba.

106
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,730
不愧是我的好女儿
That's my girl.

107
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,830
我们回家吧
Let's go home now.

108
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,950
帕尔瓦娜？
Parvana?

109
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,220
你跟那男的说我已经许配给别人了
You told that boy I was promised to someone.

110
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,050
我是要结婚了吗？
Am I getting married?

111
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,860
当然不是 你还是个孩子呢
Of course not. You are still a child.

112
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,260
我现在只想让你天天玩耍 讲讲故事就好
I want you playing and telling stories.

113
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,130
我长大了 不愿意讲什么故事了
I'm too old for that now.

114
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,230
长大了就不爱故事了？ 你一直很爱故事啊
Too old for stories? You've always loved stories.

115
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,170
讲故事能有什么用？
What's the use?

116
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,980
我跟你妈妈谈几句 一切都会好起来的
I'll have a word with Mama-jan and we'll sort it all out.

117
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,720
求你别提那裙子的事
Please don't mention the dress.

118
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,890
要不她会唠叨个没完的
Then I'll never hear the end of it.

119
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,230
- 什么没完？ - 没事 妈妈
- The end of what? - Nothing, Mama-jan.

120
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,860
我们不卖帕尔瓦娜的漂亮裙子了
We're not selling Parvana's good dress.

121
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,360
爸爸 我说的不是这个
Baba, that's not what I meant.

122
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,430
我们需要钱 孩子她爸
We need the money, Baba.

123
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,240
这几天市场比较萧条 过一阵就好了
We'll hold off for a bit. I think business will pick up.

124
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,310
如果经济好起来 我们当然不用卖这裙子
If business picks up, then we won't have to sell it, sure.

125
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,110
但是理想很遥远 现实很骨感 我们必须卖掉它
But the sky is far and the earth is hard. We will have to sell it soon.

126
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,180
好吧 那饭前讲个故事如何？
Well, what about a little story before dinner?

127
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,780
这样暂时我们都不会因裙子的事而烦心了
And we'll forget all about dresses for a while.

128
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,350
或许帕尔瓦娜想给我们讲个故事？
Maybe Parvana would like to read something for us?

129
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,060
现在我不想讲 妈妈 我好累
Not right now, Mama-jan. I'm tired.

130
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,930
她跟我说她已经长大了
She's not a child anymore, she tells me.

131
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,190
所以她现在不喜欢故事了
So she doesn't like stories.

132
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,800
别急着当大人 宝贝女儿
Don't be in such a hurry to grow up, my sweet girl.

133
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,170
长大并没你想的那么好
It might not be all that you expect.

134
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,440
我们家没水了 今早你带回来的水不够
We're out of water. You didn't bring enough this morning.

135
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,370
门边不是有半桶水嘛
But there's half a bucket by the door.

136
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,480
我在你这岁数的时候 家里从来没缺过水
When I was young enough to fetch water, the buckets were never empty.

137
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,340
- 嘿 - 你们俩别闹了
- Hey! - Girls, stop it.

138
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,410
如果你不去井里打水的话
Either you go out and get more water after dinner...

139
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,920
你就得给扎西换尿布
or you can wash Zaki's dirty diapers.

140
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,450
你今天怎么样？ - 好多了
- How are you feeling? - Better.

141
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,920
有你在我就好多了
Now that you're here.

142
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,060
要不是你总洗头 也许水不会这么快就用光呢
Maybe if you didn't wash your hair so much, we wouldn't run out so quickly.

143
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,990
- 帕尔瓦娜 - 要尊重你姐姐
- Parvana. - You should have some respect.

144
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,800
你们怎么不吃呢？
Why don't you eat, hmm?

145
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,040
- 吃饱了一切才会好起来 - 好的
- Things always look better when your belly is full. - Yes, Maudar.

146
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,380
扎西 扎西 等我先把你袖子卷好
Zaki, Zaki, wait till I pull up your sleeves.

147
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,980
不要嘛 妈妈
No, Mama-jan.

148
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,990
这样就好啦
There. There you go.

149
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,120
别把葡萄干都吃了 帕尔瓦娜 那是留给扎西的
Don't eat all the raisins, Parvana. Leave them for Zaki.

150
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,460
你怎么不把你下巴上的那粒大葡萄干给扎西呢 苏拉娅？
Why don't you give him that big raisin on your chin, Soraya?

151
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,830
哦 不对 那不是葡萄干
Oh, but it's not a raisin.

152
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,930
是个长毛的大痣
It's a big, hairy mole.

153
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,340
帕尔瓦娜 向苏拉娅道歉
Parvana, apologize to Soraya.

154
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,780
帕尔瓦娜？
Parvana?

155
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,150
他就在里面 我看他进去的
He's in there! I saw him!

156
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,920
- 如果家里有女人... - 爸爸？
- If there are women present... - Baba?

157
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,790
把自己裹好
Cover yourselves now!

158
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,120
就这个人 他是伊斯兰的敌人
That's the man. An enemy of Islam.

159
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,390
他有禁书 还教女人读禁书
He's got forbidden books, and he's teaching the women with them!

160
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,300
- 放过我们吧 - 他什么也没干
- Leave us be! - He's done nothing!

161
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,200
拿孺拉·阿利在 跟我们走一趟吧
Nurullah Alizai, you must come with us.

162
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,570
爸爸
Baba!

163
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:30,140
- 你们不能带他走 - 爸爸
- You can't take him! - Baba!

164
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,270
爸爸
Baba-jan!

165
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,210
你们要带他去哪？
Where is he being taken?

166
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,210
去监狱
To prison.

167
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,120
普利查西监狱的人会好好教育他的
They'll teach him a good lesson in Pul-e-Charkhi.

168
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,220
爸爸
Baba!

169
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,890
爸爸
Baba!

170
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,480
妈妈？ 我能开灯吗？
Mama-jan? Can I light the lamp?

171
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,920
嘘 帕尔瓦娜 你会吵醒扎西的
Hush, Parvana. You'll wake Zaki.

172
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,880
可如果他们放过了爸爸
But if they let Baba go,

173
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,650
他需要灯光才能看到家在哪
he'll need a light in the window to see home.

174
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,190
他怎么可能还回得来？他连他的拐杖都没来得及带走
How could he come home? He doesn't even have his stick to walk with.

175
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,360
快睡觉吧 都会好起来的
Go back to sleep. It will be all right.

176
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,370
你怎么知道的 妈妈？你怎么知道？
How do you know that, Mama-jan? How do you know?

177
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,040
别说了 帕尔瓦娜 妈妈已经够愁的了
Be quiet, Parvana. She has enough to worry about.

178
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,380
嘿 扎西 别拽了
Hey! Zaki, stop it.

179
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,990
起床了 帕尔瓦娜 别闹了
Get up, Parvana. Stop playing around.

180
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,550
为什么？怎么回事？
Why? What's going on?

181
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,220
你跟我去找你爸爸
You and I are going to find Baba.

182
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:59,130
那个男孩说你爸爸在普利查西监狱 我们今天就去那
The boy said he was being taken to Pul-e-Charkhi prison, so that's where we are going.

183
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,030
但是没有爸爸 我们不能出门
But we can't go outside without Baba.

184
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,130
苏拉娅正在写一封给监狱长的信
Soraya is writing a letter for the prison governor

185
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,500
信中对拿孺拉被捕事件提出抗议并请求立即释放你爸爸
to protest Nurullah's arrest and ask for his release.

186
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,470
至少我能把信给他们 - 妈妈 这是不允许的
- At least I can give them that. - Mama-jan, it's not allowed.

187
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,670
如果不引人注意的话 我们不会有问题的
We might be all right if we don't draw attention to ourselves.

188
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,470
- 但我们不能... - 行了 帕尔瓦娜
- But we can't... - Come on, Parvana.

189
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,280
带上你爸爸的拐杖 准备出发
And bring Baba's walking stick. We have to get going.

190
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,020
妈妈
Mama.

191
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,240
嘿
Hey.

192
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,180
嘿 你
Hey, you!

193
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:57,350
问安 你能告诉我普利查西监狱是哪个方向吗？
Salaam. Can you tell me the way to Pul-e-Charkhi?

194
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,660
问安 过河后向东走
Salaam. Uh, it's east, past the river.

195
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,160
- 但是路很远 - 谢谢您
- But it's a long way. - Thank you, sir.

196
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,400
听好 你们得从老城穿过去 要不你们会被抓的
Listen. Go through the old town, or you'll be caught.

197
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,190
为什么你们独自在外？
Why are you out here by yourself?

198
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,120
- 你丈夫呢？ - 我没办法啊
- Where is your husband? - I have no choice.

199
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,060
没有成年男性伴随 女人禁止独自出门
It's not permitted to be out here without your husband or your brother.

200
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,090
- 对不起 我知道的 - 你懂吗？
- I'm sorry. I know. - Do you understand?

201
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:41,160
我带着这封抗议我丈夫的抓捕行为的信...- 别废话 快回家
- I am bringing a letter protesting my husband's arrest... - Just go home.

202
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,660
- 不行 - “不行”是什么意思？
- No! - What do you mean, "no"?

203
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,400
这是我的丈夫 拿孺拉·阿利在
This is Nurullah Alizai, my husband.

204
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,100
- 他在无指控前提下昨晚被捕 - 禁止留照片
- He was arrested last night with no charges laid against him. - Photographs are forbidden!

205
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,540
- 我家里只剩女人了... - 你想干什么？ 又是给我看照片...
- I have no one at home... - What are you doing, showing me a photograph?

206
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,040
- 又是在外抛头露面的 快滚回家 - 我家里只有女人和孩子
- Out here by yourself. Go home! - There is no one in my house except for children.

207
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,450
你不能在外面闲逛 你懂吗？立即回家
You have no business out here. Do you understand? Go home. Immediately.

208
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,550
你这是自找麻烦
You're looking for trouble now!

209
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,260
你是你丈夫和民族的耻辱
You are an insult to your husband, to your race!

210
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,400
我得知道他现在状况如何
I need to find out what happened to him!

211
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,070
闭嘴
Shut up!

212
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:36,450
去监狱也没什么用
Going to the prison will change nothing.

213
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:39,250
如果你去监狱惹麻烦
If you make trouble like this,

214
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,120
你丈夫会因你的无礼行为而受重罚的
your husband will be punished severely for your insolence.

215
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,060
如果你再看到你在外不回家的话 我会把你抓起来的
And if I find you out here again by yourself, I will arrest you.

216
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,300
现在回家
Now go.

217
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,340
妈妈？
Mama-jan?

218
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,310
带我回家
Take me home.

219
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,440
- 还要 - 嘘
- More! - Shh.

220
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,240
去打水 帕尔瓦娜 家里没水了
Go get water, Parvana. We have none left.

221
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,620
快去
Come on.

222
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,210
滚出去
Get out!

223
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,550
你想干什么？
What are you up to?

224
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,550
快离开这 他们会看到你的
Get out of here. They'll see you!

225
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,250
嘿 站住
Hey, stop!

226
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,630
听见没 我让你站住
Stop when I tell you!

227
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,530
来这边
Through here!

228
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,270
站住
Stop!

229
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,870
那男孩往哪跑了？
Where did that boy go?

230
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,570
你看到了吗？看到他了吗？
Did you see? Did you see?

231
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,440
- 嘿 那个女孩你别跑 - 嘿
- Hey, you! Girl! - Hey!

232
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,580
- 别跑 - 别管那个女孩了
- Come on! - Forget about her!

233
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,950
帕尔瓦娜 你只打回来半桶水
Parvana, this is only half a bucket.

234
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,820
你不能打满一桶水再回来吗？
Couldn't you fill them up all the way?

235
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:28,490
扎西 嘘 别吵醒妈妈
Zaki, shh. Don't wake her.

236
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,790
- 嘘 扎西 - 妈妈
- Hush, Zaki. - Mama-jan!

237
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,730
- 嘘 - 哄他安静下来 帕尔瓦娜
- Shh. - Sooth him, Parvana.

238
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,400
妈妈
Mama-jan.

239
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,930
给他讲个故事
Tell him a story.

240
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,570
妈妈...
Mama...

241
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,300
很久很久以前
One time in the distant past,

242
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,900
在兴都库什山脚下有个小村庄
there was a little village at the foot of the Hindu Kush mountains.

243
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,810
- 我想要妈妈 - 嘘 好好听故事
- I want Mama-jan. - Shh. Listen.

244
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:52,280
村民刚得到许多珍贵的种子
The villagers had just managed to gather precious seeds.

245
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,680
为此 他们载歌载舞 开怀大吃
And so, there was dancing and singing and laughing and eating.

246
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,890
每个人都洋溢着欢乐的笑容
Everyone was happy.

247
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,890
尤其是一个男孩
Especially for one boy

248
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:04,920
歌 舞 笑 吃 属他最欢
who danced and sang and laughed and ate more than anyone else.

249
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,710
正当村民载歌载舞 开怀大吃的时候
While the villagers were dancing and singing and laughing and eating,

250
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,850
怪物来袭了
monsters were coming.

251
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,630
怪物们吓跑了驴子 啃食了树木
The monsters frightened the donkeys and ate the trees.

252
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,860
他们偷走了全村最宝贵的东西...
They stole the most precious thing in the whole village...

253
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,340
明年用来耕种的种子
the seeds for next year's crop.

254
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:54,610
然后怪物们跑回其主人栖息的兴都库什山脉...
Then they ran back to the Hindu Kush mountains where their master lay...

255
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:58,480
它就是可怕的象王 有着像尖刺一样的象牙
the dreadful Elephant King with spikes for tusks.

256
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,850
嗷儿！
Grrrroar!

257
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,520
嗷儿！嗷儿！
Grroar! Grroar!

258
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,820
嗷儿！
Grroar!

259
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,330
妈妈
Mama-jan.

260
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:44,460
求你快吃吧 妈妈 吃饱了才会好受些
Please eat, Mama-jan. You'll feel better when your belly is full.

261
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,410
我们家快断粮了
There's hardly any food left.

262
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,620
那我去集市

但是 先生 求你了 能卖给我6个苹果吗？
But, sir, can I please have six apples?

269
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:41,710

- Get your father to buy food for you. - My father has been taken.

270
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,920

I'm sorry. Maybe come back later.

271
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,780

回去 回家去
Go! Go home!

278
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,770
我把包弄丢了

我给你留了一块馕饼
I saved you a piece of naan.

283
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,490
我给你热一下 就会又好吃又新鲜 好不好？
I'll heat it up for you so it's nice and fresh. All right?

284
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,740
- 我们该怎么办？ - 我也不知道
- What are we going to do? - I don't know.

285
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,980
也许明早我早点出去 在市场人多起来之前买吃的回来
Maybe if I go out early, before it's crowded.

286
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,750
没用的 帕尔瓦娜
It won't work, Parvana.

287
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,290
市场里的人不会冒险东西卖给你的
Market sellers won't risk getting in trouble for serving you.

288
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,890
妈妈的表兄住在马扎里沙里夫
Mama-jan has cousins in Mazar-e-Sharif.

289
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,990
我可以写信请他们帮帮忙
I could write to them for help.

290
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:34,560
但是我们跟他们连面都没见过 你怎么知道他们会帮忙呢？
But we've never even met them. How do you know they will help?

291
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,030
我们现在就需要食物啊
We need food now.

292
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,770
这些是你哥哥的旧衣服
These were your brother's clothes.

293
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,980
它们很大 但是穿的时候向上提一提就好
They will be big, but we can take them up a bit.

294
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,210
我看起来像男孩吗？
Do I look like a boy?

295
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,950
你看起来像苏莱曼
You look like Sulayman.

296
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,150
- 太像了 - 妈妈

他是个好男孩
He was such a good boy.

298
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:42,020
他那会儿也不比你现在大多少
Not much older than you are now.

299
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,130
嘘
Shh.

300
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
没事的 妈妈
It's all right, Mama-jan.

301
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,900
帕尔瓦娜要去集市买食物 还要打水
Parvana is going to the market for food and water.

302
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,900
只有这个办法了 妈妈 我们什么都没有了
It's the only way, Mama-Jan. We have nothing left.

303
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,460
但是这些果汁是温的 我才不要温的果汁
But these juices are warm. I don't want warm juice.

304
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,050
是的 我就是那么说的 但是你知道的...
Yes, that's what I said, but you know...

305
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,350
问安 向您问安
Salaam. Salaam!

306
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,160
打扰下 问安
Excuse me. Salaam!

307
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,890
问安 问安  进来吧 小伙子
Salaam! Salaam! Come inside, boy!

308
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,070
我又不送货 是吧！
I'm not going to deliver, am I?

309
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:01,040
就是这么回事 你知道了吧？
But you know how it goes, right?

310
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,310
说吧 你要买什么
Well, let's hear it.

311
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:10,180
我要买一公斤大米 半公斤小扁豆 和一小点葡萄干
I need a kilo of rice, a half kilo of lentils, and a small amount of raisins.

312
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,050
一小点
A small amount?

313
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,410
卖你多少按我的想象来？
Should I go by my imagination?

314
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,120
是的
Yes.

315
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,050
这孩子 不是很灵光啊
Not very bright, this one.

316
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,390
烂铁也造不出利剑啊
Poor iron won't make a sharp sword.

317
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,960
看看他的傻笑
Look at him smiling!

318
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,460
这孩子都不知道我们在取笑他什么
Little guy doesn't even know when he's being made fun of.

319
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,000
谢谢您 非常感谢
Thank you. Thank you very, very much.

320
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,160
茶都洒出来了
You're spilling the tea.

321
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,830
对不起 叔叔
Sorry, Uncle.

322
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,400
你是谁？ 你为什么盯着我看？
Who are you? Why were you staring at me?

323
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,900
- 你叫什么名字？ - 我的名字？
- What is your name? - My name?

324
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,270
- 我在哪见过你的   - 不是... 我不是...
- I know you from somewhere. - No... I wasn't...

325
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:14,370
- 不是什么？  - 你不可能认识我
- Wasn't what? - You don't know me.

326
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,180
- 我认识你的  - 不可能！
- I do know you. - No!

327
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,950
- 我真认识你 你是帕尔瓦娜   - 我不是
- I do know you! You're Parvana! - I'm not!

328
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,350
我是什沃吉亚 记得吗？ 学校里那个？
I am Shauzia! Remember? From school?

329
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:26,050
- 什沃吉亚？ - 我之前是留长头发的 话说那会儿你也是
- Shauzia? - I had long hair then, but so did you.

330
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,260
- 德利瓦  - 别跟别人说
- Deliwar. - Don't tell anyone.

331
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,790
给你帽子
Here's your cap.

332
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,860
你需要一个男孩的名字
You need to get a boy's name

333
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,430
这样下次别人再问你的时候 你就不会犹豫了
so you don't hesitate next time somebody asks you.

334
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,300
我现在叫德利瓦
I am Deliwar now.

335
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,930
名字的意思是“勇敢”

336
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,300
- 你在哪呢？ - 我 我得走了

338
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,940
德利瓦
Deliwar.

339
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,610
妈妈 请坐下吧
Mama-jan, please sit down.

340
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:54,180
- 马上要到宵禁了 如果到时候她还没有回来呢？ - 她没事的 我...
- It will be curfew soon. What if she's not back by then? - She's fine. I'm...

341
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,520
谁肚子饿了？
Who's hungry?

342
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,090
帕尔瓦娜
Parvana.

343
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,320
感谢真主安拉 他把你给我带回来了
Praise Allah. He has returned you to me.

344
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,890
妈妈 你把馕饼都挤扁了
Mama-jan, you're squashing the naan.

345
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,960
闻起来太香了 帕尔瓦娜
It smells delicious, Parvana.

346
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,970
扎西
Zaki.

347
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,310
是我啊 认出来了么？
It's me. See?

348
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,980
我特别为你买的
I bought them especially for you.

349
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,950
帕尔瓦娜？
Parvana?

350
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,050
如果你现在就跑出去打水
If you run out and get some water,

351
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,260
等你回来时 他就会习惯你的新样子了
he'll get used to you by the time you come back.

352
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,420
- 但是我已经累了 - 快点 帕尔瓦娜
- But I'm tired. - Hurry on, Parvana.

353
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,130
马上就要宵禁了
It's almost curfew.

354
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:10,230
你看着太像他了
You look so much like him.

355
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,630
去把苏莱曼的衣服换下来吧
Go change Sulayman's clothes,

356
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,430
要不该弄脏了
or you'll get them dirty.

357
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,230
已经脏了
They are already dirty.

358
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,410
大象
Elephant.

359
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:28,280
什么？
What?

360
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,580
他想让你继续讲大象的故事
He wants you to continue your story about the elephant.

361
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,580
大象
Elephant.

362
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,320
好吧 嗯...
Well, um...

363
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,550
在村子里
in the village,

364
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,990
在兴都库什山脉脚下
under the Hindu Kush mountains,

365
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,530
可怜的村民们都失声痛哭
the poor villagers cried bitter tears.

366
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:49,330
没有了珍贵的种子 他们变得惊慌失措
They did not know what they would do without their precious bag of seeds.

367
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,100
明年春天没有了种子可以去播种
They would have nothing to sow come next spring

368
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,370
到了冬天也没有可以吃的食物
and nothing to eat come next winter.

369
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:58,200
但是那个男孩 他并没有哭
But the boy, he did not cry bitter tears.

370
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,410
他看向山峦 然后大喊...
He looked toward the mountain and he shouted...

371
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:02,680
我才不害怕你呢
I am not afraid of you,

372
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,380
又大又扎人的坏象王！
big, spiky, bad Elephant King!

373
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:16,120
也许有一点点害怕
Well, maybe he was a little bit afraid.

374
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:19,690
他告诉村里这些以苦泪洗面的人
He told the villagers who had been weeping bitter tears

375
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:23,230
在春天之前 他就能把种子拿回来
that he would get the bag of seed back before spring.

376
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:26,100
在春天到来之前 我就能把种子拿回来
I will get the bag of seed back before spring.

377
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,600
但是他们都嘲笑了他
But they laughed.

378
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,740
他们大笑不止 因他只是个孩子 并不是一位伟大的勇士
They laughed and laughed, because he was a child and not a great warrior.

379
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,510
但是男孩又一次发了誓
Yet the boy repeated his promise.

380
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:39,510
我说了 我会在春天之前把那一袋种子拿回来
I said, I will get the bag of seed back before spring.

381
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,280
接着他离开了村庄
And he left the village

382
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,650
向着象王的怒吼勇敢前进
to the sound of the Elephant King's roars ahead of him.

383
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,460
吼！
Roar!

384
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,150
妈妈 既然现在我扮成男孩了
Mama-jan, now that I am a boy

385
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:23,160
我们就可以去监狱找爸爸了
we can go to the prison and find Baba.

386
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,690
不 帕尔瓦娜 我们不能这么做
No, Parvana, we can't do that.

387
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,190
- 为什么不行？ - 嘘 安静
- Why not? - Shh.

388
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,660
没你想得那么简单 帕尔瓦娜
It's not that simple, Parvana.

389
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,530
但我们总得试一试啊
But we have to try.

390
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:34,130
- 我们什么也做不了  - 才不是
- There's nothing we can do. - That's not true.

391
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,610
别说了 帕尔瓦娜 别惹她伤心了
Stop it, Parvana. You're upsetting her.

392
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,650
嘿 嘿 我叫你站住 你怎么还跑？
Hey! Hey! I told you to stop! Why do you keep running?

393
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,720
别人叫你站住的时候 你就应该乖乖听话
You should have stopped when you were told to.

394
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,320
你的布卡袍呢 你为什么如此打扮就出门
Where's your burqa? Why are you dressed like this outside your house?

395
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,830
我丈夫把我的布卡袍拿走了 我得去买药
My husband took my burqa. I needed to buy medicine.

396
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,590
住嘴
Stop it. Stop it.

397
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,700
他居然允许你出门不穿布卡袍 他该受到惩罚
He should be punished for letting you outside like this!

398
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,400
- 拜托 别这样 - 你必须得替他受罚
- Please, please! Please! - You have to take his punishment!

399
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,340
乖乖待在里面吧 那才是属于你的地方
Stay inside where you belong!

400
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,600
德利瓦 德利瓦
Deliwar. Deliwar!

401
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,930
你想好叫什么了吗？
Well? Have you remembered your name yet?

402
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:40,730
我想我没法继续扮男孩了
I don't think I can go on like this.

403
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,670
太可惜了 我还指望你帮帮我呢
Too bad. I could use some help.

404
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:50,780
- 我看到了些事 - 你指望我能说什么？
- I saw something. - What do you want me to say?

405
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,280
我本该帮忙的
I should have helped.

406
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,820
- 你能做的也就是给自己招来几次鞭打了 - 但我不是男孩
- You'd have helped yourself to a good whipping, that's all. - But I'm not a boy.

407
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,750
你不是男孩 也不是女孩
You're not a boy, you're not a girl.

408
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:01,560
我需要帮助 托盘太重了 你能帮我下吗？
I need a helper because this tray is too heavy. Will you help?

409
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,730
快挠挠我鼻子 如果我松手皮带会断的
Scratch my nose. Quickly. If I let go of the tray, the strap will break.

410
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,290
好多了
That's better.

411
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,860
- 奥狄什 - 你说什么？
- Aatish. - What?

412
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,630
我想好我的名字了 就叫奥狄什
I remembered my name. It's Aatish.

413
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,970
- 那可算不上是个名字 - 它的意思是“火”
- That's not really a name. - It means "fire."

414
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:17,700
我知道它的意思 不代表这词算是个名字
I know what it means, but it's still not a name.

415
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,810
可它跟我挺配的
Then it suits me fine.

416
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,410
那我就叫你奥狄什好了
I'll call you Aatish then.

417
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:25,610
如果你是个男孩 你想去哪里都行
When you're a boy you can go anywhere you like,

418
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,420
奥狄什汗
Aatish Khan.

419
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,560
我们要去哪？
Where are we going?

420
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,300
等着瞧吧
You'll see.

421
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,880
如果有人看到我们怎么办？
What if someone sees us?

422
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,350
我一般都假装说我在这工作
I usually just pretend I work here.

423
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,580
假话说道你自己都信了 那别人也会信
If you look like you believe it, then they will too.

424
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,750
看到没 我们就是清洁工
See? We're cleaners.

425
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,990
你还在等什么呢？
What are you waiting for?

426
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:41,390
我们不拿走的话 就白白便宜给老鼠了
It's either ours, or the mice eat it.

427
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:43,790
我得想个办法去找我爸爸
I need to find a way to see my Baba.

428
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,590
喜欢的话 把我爸给你都行 反正我不想要他这样的爸爸
You can have mine if you like. I don't want him.

429
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:50,430
自从我爸入狱后 我们就再也没听到过他的消息了
My father was taken to prison and we've heard nothing of him since.

430
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:53,000
- 他们是不会让你见他的 帕尔瓦娜 - 但是我现在是个男孩了
- They won't let you see him, Parvana. - But I'm a boy now.

431
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,740
没什么区别 无论他们是继续关着你爸爸还是放了他 你都帮不上什么忙的
Doesn't make a difference. They'll keep him or let him go, but there's nothing you can do.

432
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,940
这可说不准
You don't know that.

433
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,410
抱歉 但事实就是这样
I'm sorry. It's just the way it is.

434
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:09,680
也许有办法 但是得花上很多钱
There might be a way, but you'll need lots of money.

435
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,620
钱能有什么用？
What for?

436
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,820
靠贿赂能办成很多事 很多很多
You can get a lot done with bribes. A lot.

之前在这摆摊的男人呢？
What happened to the man who used to sit here?

443
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:39,010
这问题很好答吧
It is a simple question.

444
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,850
你难道不知道吗？
Don't you know?

445
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:43,780
我怎么会知道？回答问题 他在哪？
How should I know? Answer the question. Where is he?

446
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,950
- 他去马扎里沙里夫了 - 那你又是他的什么人？
- He left for Mazar-e-Sharif. - And what are you to him?

447

- 你有什么要我读的？我会普什图语和达利语 - 读读这个
- Do you have something to read? I read Pashto and Dari. - Read this.

450
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,710
让我见识下你的水平
Let's see if you're any good.

452

“亲爱的拉扎克……”
"Dear Razaq..."

453
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,720
大声点 不然我去叫别人读了
Louder, or I will have to take my business elsewhere.

454
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,120
“亲爱的拉扎克 我希望在喀布尔的你能收到这封信
"Dear Razaq, I hope this letter reaches you in Kabul.

455
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:27,130
我写信给你 是想告知你一个不好的消息
I'm writing to you with sad news.

456
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:32,370
很遗憾地告诉你 哈拉·贝格姆在去她妹妹婚礼的路上去世了
I am sorry to tell you that Hala Begum died on the way to her sister's wedding.

457
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,040
她坐的那辆巴士碰到了地雷
The bus she was traveling on hit a land mine.

458
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,470
她受了重伤 难以救治
Her injuries were too great to bear

459
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,840
几小时之后便去世了
and she died some hours afterward.

460
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,480
我知道这对你来说必定是天大的打击
I know this must be a great shock to you,

461
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,810
但我要跟你说 在我最后一次和哈拉的谈话中
but please know that when I last spoke to Hala,

462
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,520
她告诉我说你对她真的很好
she told me of your kindness toward her.

463
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,120
愿真主安拉保佑你
May Allah bless you now,

I'm sorry.

466
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:36,500
我亲爱的宝贝
Ah, there's my sweet little girl

467
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,200
脸上全是喀布尔的灰尘
underneath all the dust of Kabul.

468
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:42,530
帕尔瓦娜 你给扎西什么了？
Parvana, what did you give Zaki?

469
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,800
- 1块糖 - 1整块？
- It's a piece of candy. - A piece?

470
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:47,010
喔
Oh!

471
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:49,480
太大了 他噎着了
It's big enough to choke him!

472
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,210
他没事的 苏拉娅 你坏他兴子呢
Let him be, Soraya. You're spoiling his fun.

473
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,220
嗷
Ow!

474
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:58,120
继续讲吧 帕尔瓦娜
Continue the story, Parvana.

475
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,250
讲给扎西听
For Zaki.

476
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,690
很久很久以前 有一位年轻的小男孩
There was this young boy,

477
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:07,260
他向村民发誓 要去找到那袋珍贵的种子
and he promised his people to find the precious seeds.

478
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,500
那大象呢 大象呢？
Elephant? Elephant?

479
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,600
对 还有那头大象
Yes, and the elephant.

480
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,870
晚上 男孩漫步穿过松林
At night, the boy walked through the pine trees

481
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:18,910
准备去山里跟象王对峙
on his way to the mountain to face the Elephant King.

482
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:28,720
在黑暗中 有个东西在跟着他
Something was following him in the darkness,

483
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,720
但他太害怕了 不敢回头看看到底是什么
but he was too terrified to turn around and face it.

484
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,720
于是他开始跑
He began to run,

485
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,930
跟着他的那东西也开始跑
and the thing that chased him also ran.

486
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,870
男孩跑得越快 那东西追得更紧
The boy ran faster and so did his pursuer.

487
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,700
他就在黑夜里奔跑
He ran into the night,

488
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,540
未知的魔鬼追逐着他 直到他再也没有力气继续跑
chased by the unknown demons until he could run no more.

489
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,010
他从山坡上摔了下去
He tumbled down a hill.

490
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,940
一直向下摔
Down.

491
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,140
向下摔
Down.

492
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,750
向下
Down.

493
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:18,200
亲爱的表兄 我们已很多年没有联系了
Dear Cousin, it has been many years since we have spoken,

494
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:23,100
我写这封信是想告诉你 我丈夫被抓了
but I am writing to you now to tell you that my husband has been arrested

495
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:27,080
他何时会被释放 能否被释放 我们都不得而知
and we have no word on when he will be released, if at all.

496
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:32,680
我们一家都很绝望 我急需你的帮助
My family is in a desperate situation and I need your help.

497
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,620
我家长女已到了可以嫁人的年龄了
My eldest daughter is now of age,

498
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:40,560
我希望你能考虑让她嫁给你最年幼的儿子阿杰玛
and I am asking that you consider her as a bride for your youngest son, Ajmal.

499
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,720
请把我们带出喀布尔
Please take us out of Kabul

500
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:47,930
这样我们才有生存下去机会
so that we may have a chance of survival.

501
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:50,330
我们不会成为负担的
We will not be a burden to you.

502
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:52,230
我们有生活技艺 也很坚强
We are skilled and strong

503
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:55,000
你在我们身上也不会有太多的花销
and need little by the way of means.

504
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,940
愿真主安拉保佑你 费特马
May the blessings of Allah be upon you. Fattema.

Your daughter will be very happy to wear such a beautiful dress.

515
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,740

516
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:32,100
1500吧
1,500.

517
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,840
看这裙子卟呤卟呤的 多闪啊
See how it sparkles?

518
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:37,710
我给你1000
Here's 1,000.

519
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,850
- 你挣了多少钱？ 1000
- How much did you make? - A thousand.

520
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,420
这钱差不多够贿赂一次了
That might be enough for a good bribe.

521
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:53,660
- 真的？ - 当然了
- Really? - Definitely.

522
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:57,400
我也在攒钱 只要是能从我爸那瞒下来的钱 我都会存起来
I'm saving up too. Whatever money I can hide from my father, I keep.

523
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,600
慢慢积少成多
And it's mounting up to a nice little sum.

524
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,000
看见了吗？
See?

525
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,770
你知道的 我可不想一直都呆在这
I'm not going to stay here forever, you know.

526
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:08,740
- 你见过海吗？ - 没有
- Have you ever been to the sea? - No.

527
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,940
我也是
Neither have I.

528
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:14,350
但是我听说过月亮会把海水都牵引到海岸上
But I've heard that the moon pulls the water onto the shore

529
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,280
然后海水又会退回去
and then back out again.

530
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,850
我想去看看
I want to see that.

531
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:22,820
我想把脚放在温暖的沙滩上 感受上涨时海水击打的凉意
I want to put my feet on the warm sand and have them cooled by the lapping water.

532
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:27,160
你爸爸呢？他不指望你养活吗？
What about your father? Doesn't he depend on you?

533
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,760
我是个好儿子
I am a good son.

534
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,770
但他可不是个好爸爸
But he is not a good father.

535
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,270
如果你在海边 你会干什么？
What will you do by the sea?

536
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:41,310
做些小买卖 跟现在差不多 不过是为了我自己
I'd buy things and sell things, like I do here, but for myself.

537
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:45,410
有的人去海边 什么事情也不做
There are people who go to the edge of the water to do nothing.

538
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:48,820
他们只是戴着墨镜坐在那里看海
They just sit there and they look at the sea with their sunglasses on

539
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,920
或带着游泳圈游泳
or swim about on floating tubes.

540
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,890
那我可以向他们卖这些东西
So I could sell them those things.

541
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:56,890
听起来是个好主意啊 德利瓦
Hmm. That sounds nice, Deliwar.

542
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,060
也许我们可以合伙
And maybe I'll join you.

543
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,230
- 你想要去哪？ - 祝我好运吧
- Where are you going? - Wish me luck.

544
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,410
- 你怎么回来这么早？ - 我给扎西带了一些面包和葡萄干
- Why are you back so early? - I have brought some bread and raisins for Zaki.

545
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:14,210
你想做什么 帕尔瓦娜？
What are you doing, Parvana?

546
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:15,810
我要去找爸爸
I'm going to find Baba.

547
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:17,480
- 不行 你不能去  - 我必须去
- No, you're not. - I'm going.

548
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,510
宵禁之前你是赶不回来的
You won't make it home before curfew.

549
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,880
我一定要去 你阻止不了我
I'm going. There's nothing you can do to stop me.

550
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,320
妈妈已经很受罪了 你别做蠢事来雪上加霜了
Mama-jan has been through enough without you doing something so stupid.

551
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,420
- 我必须找到爸爸  - 帕尔瓦娜
- I have to find him. - Parvana!

552
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,160
帕尔瓦娜
Parvana!

553
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,290
帕尔瓦娜
Parvana!

554
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:36,490
有人吗？
Excuse me.

555
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,990
问安 有人吗？
Salaam. Hello!

556
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:40,960
有人吗？
Excuse me!

557
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,300
你想怎样？
What do you want?

558
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:46,100
- 我说了 你想怎样？  - 我想见见我爸爸
- I said, what do you want? - I want to see my father.

559
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,030
- 谁？  - 我的爸爸 拿孺拉·阿利在
- Who? - My father, Nurullah Alizai.

560
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,970
两个星期前无故被带到这里
Brought here two weeks ago without charge.

561
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:53,910
- 滚开   - 我有钱......1000阿富汗尼
- Get out of here. - I have money... 1,000 afghani.

562
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:56,910
- 如果你答应帮助我 钱就归你  - 嘿 你在干什么？
- I can give it to you if you promise to help. - Hey, what are you doing?

563
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:59,550
没事 只是在赶个孩子走
Nothing. Just getting rid of a kid.

564
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:01,610
求你了 开门吧
Please! Open up!

565
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:04,450
我要见我爸爸 我要见他
I have to see my father! I have to see him!

566
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:09,820
不想挨更多揍就快滚
Now get out of here unless you want some more.

567
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:53,870
人们说有时雷声大雨点却小
They say it doesn't always rain the way it thunders.

568
00:44:55,970 --> 00:45:00,570
上次故事讲到 男孩摔下了山
Last we heard of him, the boy had fallen down.

569
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:05,980
他摔下了山 陷入深眠
He had fallen down the hill and into the deepest of sleeps.

570
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:09,280
但是故事并没有结束
But all was not lost.

571
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,390
他被一个老妪发现
He was discovered by an old woman.

572
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:14,990
老妪有一个鼓
She had a drum.

573
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:21,360
一个充满魔力的鼓 鼓声十分优美
A magic drum that beat so beautifully

574
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,600
鼓声唤醒了男孩
that his heart woke up.

575
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:38,440
她知道这个男孩一定有什么诉求 她便问男孩
She knew he must be on a quest, and so she asked him...

576
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:40,980
你在找什么？
What is it you seek?

577
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,550
你知道的 恐怖的象王派他的爪牙偷走了...
Well, you see, the dreadful Elephant King sent his jaguars to steal the...

578
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:50,420
没有人战胜过象王
No one has ever overcome the Elephant King.

579
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:54,030
- 我知道  - 那你凭什么认为你可以打败他？
- I know. - Well, what makes you think you can?

580
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,030
我必须战胜它
I need to.

581
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:57,630
我必须战胜它 仅此而已
I just need to, that's all.

582
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:00,530
这可不是个好答案
That's not a very good answer.

583
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:05,110
尽管如此 老妪还是告知他需要去寻找三件物品...
Nevertheless, the woman told him he'd need to find three things...

584
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:09,370
一件闪着光
something that shines,

585
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,710
一件用于抓捕的
something that ensnares,

586
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:14,050
一件能使人感到平静
and something that soothes.

587
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:18,150
只有集齐这三件事物 他才可以战胜象王
Only then would he overcome the Elephant King.

588
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,050
把它们都给我吧 拜托了
Give them to me, please!

589
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:22,050
我可没有
I don't have them,

590
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,020
你还是快去寻找它们
so you'd better go look for them.

591
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:29,600
要快哦 如果不及时播种 村民可就没有收成了
And hurry! If the seeds are not planted soon, there will be no harvest.

592
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,100
是的 我知道
Yes, I know.

593
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,470
她告诉男孩要去东边
She told him to head east.

594
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:36,400
那边才是东
East is the other way.

595
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:40,740
那个未知的东西一直尾随着男孩
Still something followed the boy,

596
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:44,150
而男孩还是不敢面对它
and still he could not face it.

597
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,170
- 他没收下钱？  - 我觉着贿赂他们没用
- He didn't take the money? - I don't think bribes work on them.

598
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:10,770
不不不 可能钱不够吧
No, no. It probably wasn't enough.

599
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,700
钱太少可能让他感到不爽
It might have insulted him.

600
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:16,240
你只需要再攒些钱 下次机灵点
You'll just have to save up more and be even smarter next time.

601
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,680
- 啊  - 你要我机灵点？
- Aaah! - I have to be smarter?

602
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,380
我听说有个人给杂工很高的薪水
I've heard there is a guy who pays well for small jobs.

603
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,380
跟我走
Come on.

604
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:27,690
先生您好 我们来找工作
Sir, we have come to work.

605
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:30,820
- 你们是？ - 我是德利瓦 这是奥狄什
- And you are? - I'm Deliwar. And this is Aatish.

606
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:32,620
他是我兄弟
We are brothers.

607
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:35,060
奥狄什算什么名字？
What kind of a name is Aatish?

608
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,700
我不知道 这要问我们的爸爸了
I don't know. Ask our father.

609
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,400
- 你爸在哪？ - 他在俄国人的枪下殉道了
- Where is your father? - He was martyred by the Russians.

610
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:43,200
只要价钱公道
We can do any job you want.

611
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,570
我们什么都能做
For the right price.

612
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,120
我想这应该是最后一个了吧
That's the last one, I think.

613
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,820
我们这是在哪？
Where are we anyway?

614
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:03,790
可算搬完了 你们这两个孩子真弱
About time. You boys are not very strong.

615
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:05,720
这可比你说的工作重多了
It was more work than you said.

616
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:07,790
这是你们的报酬 快走开吧
Here you are. Now be off.

617
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,330
嘿 我们可都是按你说的做的
Hey, we did all that you asked.

618
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:13,160
等等 你说过要把我们带回去的
Wait! You said you'd drive us back.

619
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:15,300
我可不是出租车司机 自己回家吧
I'm not a taxi. Make your own way home.

620
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:18,800
你们装货这么慢已经让我迟到了
I'm late already because you took so long to load the truck.

621
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:20,570
等等
Wait!

622
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,330
我得休息会
I need to rest a moment.

623
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:43,330
沿着路走 这个地方可能有地雷
Stay on the path. This place might be mined.

624
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:08,550
这点钱可不够 我们需要更好的工作
This is not nearly enough. We need better jobs.

625
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,660
- 比如呢？ - 我听说烧砖挣的钱挺多
- Like what? - I heard brick making pays well.

626
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,600
但会很累
But it's hard work.

627
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:17,500
真希望我能更强壮一些
I wish I was stronger.

628
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,700
可你不是有个哥哥吗？
But you have an older brother, don't you?

629
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,270
以前他总是让你骑在脖子上 带你去上学
He used to bring you to school on his shoulders.

630
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:25,170
他叫什么？
What's his name?

631
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,610
苏莱曼
Sulayman.

632
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:31,180
他已经去世了
He died.

633
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,680
什么原因？疾病？
How? Was it the sickness?

634
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,350
- 我不知道 - 可你妈妈应该跟你讲过吧
- I don't know. - But your mother must have told you.

635
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:38,520
她从没提起过 懂吗？
She doesn't speak of it. All right?

636
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:42,520
好吧
All right.

637
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:48,660
嘿 看看这个
Hey, look what I've got.

638
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:52,660
我在我爸爸的小收纳箱里发现的
I found it in a little box where my father keeps his things.

639
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:55,900
你能相信海水竟是如此的蓝吗？
Can you believe the water is that blue?

640
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,710
这真漂亮
It's very nice.

641
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:08,550

提供代写代读服务
Anything written! Anything read!

644
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:17,460
上次我没付钱
I didn't pay you last time.

645
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,290
- 该给你多少？ - 没关系的 呃...
- How much do I owe you? - It's okay. I...

646
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:22,530
怎么 坏消息就不收费吗？
What, you don't charge for bad news?

647
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:30,270
是谁教你识字的？那个残疾的老师吗？
Who taught you to read? The crippled teacher?

648
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:32,000
嗯 他是我叔叔
Yes. My uncle.

649
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:34,470
你写信跟读信一样厉害吗？
Can you write as good as you read?

650
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:35,740
我可以的
I can.

651
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:39,310
瞧
Here.

652
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,450
我觉得你可能会要回这封信 所以就一直留着呢
I kept this in case you wanted it.

653
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:47,990
告诉我 告诉我哪处是她的名字
Show me. Show me where it says her name.

654
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:50,460
哪写了“哈拉”
Where it says "Hala."

655
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,360
那儿 看到了吗？
There. See?

656
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:56,660
哈拉
Hala.

657
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:16,820
你知道哈拉是什么意思吗？
Do you know what it means?

658
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,490
不知道
No.

659
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:23,620
有时候 在你透过晴朗的夜空看月亮时
Sometimes, on a clear night when you look at the moon,

660
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:26,290
能看到月亮被一条明亮的光圈围绕着
you can see a bright outline around it.

661
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:30,930
那条光圈就叫作哈拉
That outline is called hala.

662
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:34,370
我妻子以它来取名
My wife was named for that light.

663
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:45,340
- 给你 - 这太多了
- Here. - This is too much.

664
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:47,580
别推辞
Don't argue with me.

665
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:48,820
谢谢你
Thank you.

666
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:04,060
好啦 扎西 我可以揪你的吗？
Stop it, Zaki. Can I pull yours?

667
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,930
让他安静点 我还想睡觉呢
Keep him quiet. I'm trying to sleep.

668
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:12,840
- 你犯什么毛病呢？ - 要不你给扎西讲个故事吧 好不好？
- What's the matter with you? - Why don't you tell Zaki a story, hmm?

669
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,540
我们都很喜欢
We'd all like that.

670
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:17,910
好吧 扎西 你想听故事里的小男孩后来怎么样了吗？
Well, Zaki, do you want to know what happened to the boy?

671
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:21,880
好的 好的 还有大象
Yes, yes, and the elephant.

672
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:27,750
男孩跑啊跑 他很害怕 心跳得特别快
The boy ran and ran, his heart beating fast in fear.

673
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,920
身后追逐他的东西丝毫没有停下的意思
And the thing that chased him never stopped.

674
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:37,500
于是小男孩非常害怕地躲在树后
So the boy hid behind a tree and he waited for courage.

675
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:48,110
一位老妇人想要挤山羊奶
An ancient woman had been trying to milk a goat,

676
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:50,540
可她后背酸痛难忍
but her back was very sore.

677
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:55,980
我的背好痛啊
My back is very sore.

678
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:00,620
男孩很同情老妇人 于是让老妇人在树荫下休息
The boy took pity on her and told her to rest under the shade of a tree

679
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,690
他来挤羊奶
and he would do the milking instead.

680
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:04,790
您到树荫下坐着吧
Please sit under the shade of this tree,

681
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:07,460
我来帮您挤
and I will do the milking instead.

682
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,740
当他挤完羊奶后
When he finished milking the goat,

683
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:19,840
老妇人与他分享美味又温暖的羊奶
the old woman shared the lovely, warm milk with him.

684
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:23,810
这是他喝过最好喝的羊奶
It was the nicest milk he had ever tasted,

685
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:26,480
于是他称赞老了妇人的羊群
and he complimented the woman on her goats.

686
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,680
您山羊的产奶量真多
Your goats are very generous.

687
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,920
老妇人给男孩一面镜子作为回报
In return, the old woman gave him a mirror.

688
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:36,120
看 多闪啊
See how it shines!

689
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,620
得到镜子后 男孩非常高兴
The boy was delighted with the mirror,

690
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:43,730
但他看着镜子时 镜子照出了尾随他的东西
but as he looked into it, he saw the reflection of the thing that followed him!

691
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:49,700
妈妈 你在做什么？
What are you doing, Mama-jan?

692
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,500
我在收拾苏拉娅的衣服
I'm laying out Soraya's good clothes.

693
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:54,840
这些衣服要我拿到市场去卖吗？
Am I to sell them at the market?

694
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,850
嘘 帕尔瓦娜 该睡觉了
Shh, shh, shh, Parvana. It's time to sleep.

695
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:09,620
我得想方设法去白沙瓦
I just need to find a way to get to Peshawar,

696
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,760
在那里我会计划出属于我的未来
and I can figure it out from there.

697
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,160
我想果阿会有海滩
I think there's a beach in Goa

698
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,530
那的游客非常富有
where the tourists are very rich.

699
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:18,730
如果他们有钱 那我的蓝色石头就能卖出去了
If they're rich, they would buy my blue stones,

700
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:22,070
在那我就能经营我的小生意了 届时你就可以跟我合伙干了
and that's where I'd set up my business, and you could join me.

701
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:24,200
在我找到爸爸后
Once I find Baba.

702
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,540
嗯 在你找到你爸爸后
Once you find your Baba.

703
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:47,090
100
100.

704
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:48,590
85呗
I'll give you 85.

705
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,830
- 90最低 - 82怎么样
- Ninety. - Eighty-two.

706
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:51,830
最少85了
Eighty-five, and that's final.

707
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:54,470
再加上一串葡萄 就这么定了
Eighty-five and a bunch of grapes, and that's final.

708
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:03,710
你写字下笔太重了 但字写得不错
You're leaning too hard on the pen, but your writing is good.

709
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:06,480
如果你再温柔一点 写好字会更容易些
If you try it more gently, it'll be easier.

710
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,650
等等 请等一下
Wait! Wait a moment!

711
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:49,150
什么事？
What is it, child?

712
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:52,860
你曾问过我之前坐在我身边的那...那个老师的情况
You asked me before about the man who used to sit there... the teacher.

713
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:55,990
- 你叔叔？ - 他不是去了马扎里沙里夫
- Your uncle? - He didn't go to Mazar-e-Sharif.

714
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,160
我叔叔进了监狱 然而他是冤枉的
He was taken to prison. But he did nothing wrong.

715
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:00,730
- 哪一个？ - 什么哪一个？
- Which one? - What?

716
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:03,030
- 哪所监狱？ - 普利查西监狱
- Which prison? - Pul-e-Charkhi.

717
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,570
已经过了几个星期了 但仍就杳无音信
It's been weeks now, and my family has had no word of him.

718
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,610
星期三去监狱一趟吧
Go to the prison on Wednesday.

719
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:12,280
去找我表弟罗尚帮忙
Ask for Roshan. He's my cousin.

720
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,850
告诉他是拉扎克让你来的 他力所能及的话 就会帮你的
Tell him Razaq sent you and he will help you, if he can.

721
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,680
德利瓦
Deliwar!

722
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:49,180
照这样干下去 等我到海边的那天 我都变成风烛残年的老太太了
With work like this, I'll be an old woman by the time I get to the sea.

723
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:52,020
或是个老头儿
Or an old man.

724
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:01,330
你坐着休息下 我给你讲个故事
You sit and rest, Deliwar, and I'll tell you a story.

725
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:04,600
- 故事？ - 对呀
- A story? - Yes, a story.

726
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,260
在很久很久以前
One time in the deep past,

727
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:11,840
从前有一个小男孩 他要把怪物偷走的袋子带回到村里 袋子里装着的是十分珍贵的种子
there was a boy who had to return a stolen bag of precious seeds to his village.

728
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:15,270
是个喜剧吗 还是...悲剧呢？
Is it a happy story or a sad story?

729
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,580
你听完就知道了
Just wait and see.

730
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:21,950
男孩得知 必须集齐三件事物
The boy had been told he needed three things

731
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:25,120
才能战胜象王
in order to overcome the Elephant King...

732
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,990
一件闪着光 一件用来抓捕的 和...
something that shines, something that ensnares and something that...

733
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:31,860
喂 你们两个 过来
Hey, you two! Come here!

734
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:35,060
来啊
Come on!

735
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,660
我认识他
I know that boy.

736
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:39,200
快点 马上过来
Hurry up. Come here.

737
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,830
快点啊
Come on.

738
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:43,640
我们最好听他的话过去
We'd better do what we're told.

739
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:48,780
赶快啊 懒鬼
Get a move on, lazy kids.

740
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,020
这就是新来的苦力？
So these are the new workers?

741
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:01,890
快回答啊 你们是傻子吗？
Where are your tongues? Are you stupid?

742
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:05,090
伊德瑞斯提议用掰手腕的方式来做个小测验
Idrees suggested we have a little arm-wrestling match.

743
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:09,190
看看你们是否有资格为我工作
To see if you're strong enough to work for me.

744
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,830
我看到你坐在那儿偷懒
I saw you sitting down over there instead of working.

745
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:13,830
停下 伊德瑞斯
Idrees, stop now.

746
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:15,800
给我来杯茶水
Make me some tea.

747
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:22,710
小不点 让我见识下你有多废物
Let me see how feeble you are, little one.

748
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:26,250
这弱鸡连手都抬不起来
He can't even lift his hand.

749
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,180
起来吧 端点茶水来
Get up and make us tea.

750
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:34,920
叔叔 我觉得你需要招新工人了
Uncle, I think you need new workers.

751
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,790
- 这两个简直太废了 - 够了 伊德瑞斯
- These ones are no good. - Enough, Idrees.

752
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:39,420
别难为这些可怜的娃了
Leave the poor kids alone.

753
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:41,930
他们俩还是太嫩
They are a little undercooked.

754
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:48,070
我知道你
I know you.

755
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:50,270
你是那个老师的女...
You're the teacher's daugh...

756
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,880
伊德瑞斯
Idrees.

757
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,880
把枪拿回来
Bring the gun back!

758
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,910
我说了 把枪拿回来
I said bring the gun back!

759
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:04,820
伊德瑞斯
Idrees!

760
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,040
滚出来
Come out now!

761
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,410
给我滚出来
Come out now!

762
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:33,710
伊德瑞斯 战争已经开始了 我们要向西转移
Idrees, it has begun! We are moving west.

763
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,550
我们接到命令要立刻行动
We have been given orders to go immediately!

764
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:39,780
我知道你是谁
I know who you are!

765
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:41,290
你听见了吗？
Do you hear?

766
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:44,490
快上来 快
Get up here! Come on!

767
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:48,860
现在就上来 你个怂包
Right now! You little coward!

768
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:54,870
你不是想参战吗？ 现在你的机会来了
You want to fight? Now is your chance to fight!

769
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,240
做个男人吧
You become a man.

770
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,490
他走了
He's gone.

771
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,560
他要是回来了呢？
What if he comes back?

772
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:27,870
那只能算他运气好
He'd be lucky.

773
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:29,430
我们这是在哪？
Where are we?

774
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,840
我逃跑时候来过这里一次
I came here once when I ran away.

775
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:35,910
不知道是我身体长大了 还是进来的洞口变窄了
I think the way in has gotten smaller or I have gotten bigger.

776
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:38,380
这东西看起来有点历史了
It looks old.

777
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,950
我丢了一只鞋
I lost a shoe.

778
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:44,450
我帽子也丢了 可我觉得它就在外面
I lost my cap, although I think it's outside.

779
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:46,290
你为什么揍他？
Why did you hit him?

780
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:51,360
把我爸绑走的那伙人里有他一个
When they took my father, he was one of them.

781
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:55,230
再给我讲讲那个男孩吧
Tell me more about the boy.

782
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:56,930
什么男孩？
What boy?

783
01:00:56,930 --> 01:00:58,900
故事里的那个男孩
The story boy.

784
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:01,630
男孩觉得很冷
The boy was cold.

785
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:05,240
虽然太阳挂在空中 他却感受不到一丝温暖
Though the sun burned in the sky, it gave no heat.

786
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:08,240
但是他有一个又大又暖的外套
But he had a warm hat and a big coat.

787
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,970
不 他没有
No, he didn't.

788
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:12,440
他已经发现三件事物中的一件了...
He had already found one of the three things...

789
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:14,350
一个闪光的镜子
a mirror that shone.

790
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:17,980
但是当他往镜子里看时 他看到了他身后的东西
But when he looked at it, he saw something behind him.

791
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:20,650
那东西很吓人 非常恐怖
Something scary. Something dreadful!

792
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:23,620
- 是一匹马 - 不 什沃吉亚 不是一匹马
- A horse! - No, Shauzia, not a horse.

793
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:25,520
是啊 就是一匹马
Yes, it was.

794
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:29,130
还是一匹非常老的马 走起路来骨头都咔哒咔哒响
And it was a very old horse whose bones clattered together when it walked.

795
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:32,360
这一点都不吓人
It wasn't scary at all.

796
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:36,670
好吧  看到老马的样子 男孩感到很难过 于是他喂了它一些干草
Fine. The boy felt sad for the old horse and fed him hay.

797
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:38,640
然后他们都过上了幸福的生活
And they all lived happily ever after.

798
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,370
我才讲到故事的一半 这不是结局
It's the middle of the story, not the end!

799
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:44,140
从一个石室的门里
From a door carved into the stone,

800
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:46,440
走出来一个胖子
out came a round man.

801
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:50,510
你竟然把我的干草浪费在一匹即将死去的老马身上
You wasted my hay on an old horse that will soon be dead!

802
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:53,620
胖子把男孩扔进了一口古井的深处
The round man threw the boy deep into the belly of an ancient well.

803
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:56,220
啊..
Aaah!

804
01:01:57,490 --> 01:02:00,120
在井的底部有绿宝石
At the bottom of the well there were emeralds,

805
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:04,200
胖子想让男孩把绿宝石拿给他 作为男孩浪费干草的补偿
and the round man wanted them brought up to him as payment for the wasted hay.

806
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,560
你得把那些绿宝石拿给我
You will bring the emeralds to me.

807
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:08,600
- 他的名字是？ - 你问的是那个胖子的？
- What's his name? - The round man?

808
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,370
不是 是那个男孩的名字
No, the boy.

809
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:13,600
你不能光讲人家男孩的故事 不给人家起个名字
You can't have a story about a boy and not give him a name.

810
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:15,540
你不起我可要给他起名字了啊
Give him a name before I do.

811
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:17,410
苏莱曼
Sulayman.

812
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:19,910
他叫苏莱曼
His name is Sulayman.

813
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:22,380
这是个好名字
That's a good name.

814
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:25,350
苏莱曼倒在井的底部
Sulayman lay at the bottom of the well.

815
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:28,450
突然 他看到了几具骷髅
Suddenly, he could see skeletons.

816
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:33,290
一共3具骷髅 它们的骨手里都攥着一颗绿宝石
Three skeletons, each with an emerald clutched in its bony hands.

817
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:35,130
- 他大声呼救 - 救命
- He called out for help. - Help!

818
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:38,260
那匹可怜的老马从井口向下望着他
The poor old horse looked back at him from way above.

819
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:41,170
然后它做了一件很神奇的事情
But the horse did something extraordinary.

820
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:44,100
它发出了世界上所有种动物的叫声
He neighed with the voice of all the world's animals.

821
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:57,050
苏莱曼爬啊爬 终于爬到了井的顶部
Sulayman climbed up, up, all the way to the top,

822
01:02:57,050 --> 01:02:59,420
然后他对救他一命的老马表示了感谢
and he thanked the horse for saving his life.

823
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:02,260
谢谢你救了我的命
Thank you for saving my life.

824
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:09,590
苏莱曼拿到了那三块宝石
Sulayman had just three emeralds with him...

825
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,600
于是他要求胖子用食物来换
And asked the round man for food in return.

826
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,330
他很饿
He was hungry.

827
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:16,600
但那胖子即卑鄙又很小气
But the round man was wicked and cheap.

828
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:20,470
他扔给了苏莱曼一个渔网 让他自己捕鱼吃
He threw a fishing net at Sulayman and he told him to get his own food.

829
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:23,740
- 这网正是苏莱曼所需之物 - 哈哈
- That was exactly what Sulayman needed. - Ha-ha!

830
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:26,140
那件用来抓捕的事物
Something that ensnares.

831
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:27,750
但在苏莱曼的离开后
But as Sulayman left,

832
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:31,480
三具骷髅的鬼魂从宝石里出来了
the ghosts of the three skeletons came out of the three emeralds

833
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:34,450
它们在胖子头上缠转盘旋 吓得胖子魂不附体
and swirled and twirled and scared the round man

834
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:37,760
用如此手段来向害他们丧命的胖子复仇
in frightful vengeance for having lost them their lives.

835
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:45,660
苏莱曼和那匹老马继续向山那边进发
Sulayman and the horse continued their journey toward the mountain,

836
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:49,170
但老马越走越慢了
but the horse was getting slower and slower.

837
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:52,540
它实在是太老了 需要休息
He needed to rest, being very, very old,

838
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:55,440
于是苏莱曼为它搭了一个帐篷
and so Sulayman made a shelter for the horse

839
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,140
然后让这匹马等他回来
and told him to wait for him.

840
01:03:58,150 --> 01:04:00,510
那匹马有意阻止男孩...
The horse protested...

841
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:04,450
但苏莱曼知道 象王和它的爪牙
but Sulayman knew he had to face the Elephant King and the jaguars

842
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:06,080
他必须亲自去面对
all by himself.

843
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:08,120
我们会再见面的 老伙计
I will see you again, old horse.

844
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,390
说完他就一个人上路了
And so on he went alone.

845
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,140
明天是星期三
Tomorrow is Wednesday.

846
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:30,140
我要到监狱去了
I'm going back there, to the prison.

847
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:34,080
他们到时候会让我见我爸爸的
They'll have to let me see him then.

848
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:57,300
从现在开始 你就别出门了
From now on, you're staying inside.

849
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,570
- 那么做太危险了 - 不 妈妈
- It's much too dangerous. - No, Mama-jan.

850
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:01,770
- 我们会一起设法逃出来的 - “我们”？
- We manage all right out there. - "We"?

851
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:05,710
我和德利瓦 她也是个女孩 我们一起工作
Me and Deliwar. She's a girl too. We work together.

852
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:09,450
我们已经给我表兄写信了 让他们给你姐姐在马扎安排一门亲事
We've written to my cousin to arrange a marriage for your sister in Mazar

853
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:11,580
他们回信表示同意
They wrote back, and it was accepted.

854
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:14,450
后天会有人来把我们带走
Someone will come for us the day after tomorrow to take us away.

855
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:16,350
- 你以后不用再冒险去监狱了 - 什么？
- You don't need to do this anymore. - What?

856
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,360
这日子不能这么过
We can't go on like this.

857
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,860
- 我们不能靠你养活啊 - 为什么？
- We can't depend on you to keep us alive. - Why?

858
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:22,730
我现在挣的钱足够养家了
I provide for you just fine.

859
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:24,900
这不是一个孩子的工作
It's not the job of a child.

860
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:27,430
我们怎么能撇下爸爸离开
How can we leave without Baba?

861
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:29,900
每天你回家的时候 身上都带着伤口
Every day you come home with cuts and blisters.

862
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:33,610
每天你出去工作 我都不知能否看到你安然归来
Every day you go out there, and I don't know if I'll see you back again.

863
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,740
我不能连你也失去
I can't lose you too.

864
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:38,740
我不会去的
I'm not going.

865
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:41,810
爸爸会回来的 我们走了 家里就没人等他了
Baba could come back, and no one will be here waiting for him.

866
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:44,250
那我们要等多久
So how long should we wait?

867
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:46,680
等到他们发现你是女孩 然后也把你从我身边夺走吗？
Until you're found out and taken away from me?

868
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:48,920
等到我不得不把扎西送出去 来赚钱养家吗？
Until I have to send Zaki out to earn our keep?

869
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,220
在我们离开之前 让我去看看他吧
Let me go see him before we leave.

870
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:53,420
好让他知道我们要去的是哪
Let me tell him where we are going.

871
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:55,830
- 帕尔瓦娜 - 让我帮他把手杖带上
- Parvana! - Let me bring him his walking stick.

872
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:57,560
然后我就跟你走
Then I will go with you.

873
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:01,500
我会做一个好妹妹 一个好女儿
Then I will be a good sister and a good daughter.

874
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,100
我发誓
I promise.

875
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,510
我保证
I promise.

876
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:22,250
听话 不要走
Please don't go.

877
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:24,820
听妈妈的吧  现在外面太危险了
Please, it is much too dangerous now.

878
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:27,390
妈妈 我走了
Mama-jan, I'm going.

879
01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:29,260
宵禁之前我一定回来
I'll be back tonight before curfew.

880
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:31,800
- 不要 苏莱曼 - 妈妈
- No, Sulayman. - Mama-jan.

881
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:35,270
- 你赶不回来的 - 让她去吧
- You won't come back. - Let her go now.

882
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:37,400
让帕瓦尔娜去吧
Let Parvana go.

883
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:46,550
哦
Oh!

884
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:55,560
帕瓦尔娜
Parvana.

885
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:33,230
德利瓦
Deliwar!

886
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:37,600
你差点把我吓死
You frightened me half to death.

887
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,600
我一直在到处找你
I've been looking for you everywhere.

888
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:42,530
找我干嘛？想跟我一起去柴家商店干活吗？
Why? You want to work at the chai shop with me this morning?

889
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:46,440
- 不 我不行 - 嘿 你想给扎西弄些糖果吗？
- No, I can't. - Hey, you want some candy for Zaki?

890
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:49,280
明天我们就要离开喀布尔
We are leaving Kabul tomorrow.

891
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,740
你要离开我吗？
You are leaving me?

892
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:55,880
家里都安排好了 我也无能为力
It's been arranged. There's nothing I can do.

893
01:07:55,880 --> 01:08:00,020
我姐姐就要去马札里沙里夫结婚了
My sister is getting married in Mazar-e-Sharif.

894
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:01,620
我还要再去一次监狱
I'm going back to the prison.

895
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:03,620
我找到了一个能帮我的人
I found someone who can help me,

896
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:05,860
而且我需要更多的钱来贿赂看守
and I need to get more money to bribe the guard.

897
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:07,760
今天是最后期限了
I'll need it today.

898
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,930
你只会挨更多拳头的 这个想法很愚蠢
You'll just get another punch in the guts. It's a stupid idea.

899
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:12,760
这次不会的
I won't let that happen this time.

900
01:08:12,770 --> 01:08:15,900
- 我说了这个想法很愚蠢 - 求你了帮帮我吧
- I said it's a stupid idea. - Please help me.

901
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,770
你想让我怎么做？
What do you want me to do?

902
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:21,040
像你的儿童故事里那样 用魔法变出一些钱来给你吗？
Magic some money into your hand like in your kids' stories?

903
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,740
那是行不通的 帕瓦尔娜
It doesn't work like that, Parvana.

904
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:25,710
我帮不了你
I can't help you.

905
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:29,810
赶紧逃到马札里沙里夫 然后享受那美好的婚礼吧
Now run away to Mazar-e-Sharif and have a nice wedding party.

906
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:33,920
也许他们也会给你配个丈夫 你的麻烦就都不存在了
Maybe they'll find a husband for you too and your troubles will be over.

907
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,350
至少能挺到婚礼结束
Until after the wedding, at least.

908
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,790
你这个傻瓜
You fool!

909
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:42,600
德利瓦
Deliwar!

910
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:45,300
什沃吉亚
Shauzia.

911
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:55,940
什沃吉亚
Shauzia.

912
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:57,870
和我们一起走吧
Come with us.

913
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,410
我不能
I can't.

914
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:03,550
我爸爸会一直追到马札然后杀了我的
My father would come all the way to Mazar to kill me.

915
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:08,420
我不能就这样离开喀布尔 帕瓦尔娜
I can't leave Kabul, Parvana, not like this.

916
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:13,360
- 这儿 拿着 - 我不能拿你的钱
- Here, take this. - I can't take your money.

917
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,330
你就拿着吧
Please take it.

918
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:20,830
去看你爸爸吧
Go and see your Baba.

919
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:24,900
告诉他 他有一个好女儿
Tell him that his daughter is a good daughter.

920
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:28,580
告诉他 德利瓦说的

那片月亮牵引海水的沙滩上
where the moon pulls the water,

925
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,020
我等待和你再次相遇
20 years from today.

926
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:50,160
我想那时我会认不出你来的 奥狄什
I don't think I'll recognize you then, Aatish.

No, you see, you weren't supposed to come so soon.

我儿子不在 我们必须等他回来
My son is away. We must wait for him to return.

收拾东西 我们现在就要出发

我这趟可不能白来
I didn't come all this way for nothing.

945
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,230
要是现在不走 我们就无法离开这里了
If we do not go now, we won't get out of here at all.

Then what kind of fool are you to have sent her out alone?

960
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:01,160
上车 否则你今天可不止会失去一个孩子
Get in, or she won't be the only child you'll lose today!
