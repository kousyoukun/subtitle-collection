1
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:28,094
莉娜。
Leena.

2
00:05:32,016 --> 00:05:34,055
你以前没有回答我。
You didn't a-- answer me before.

3
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,043
你父母在这里工作吗？
Do your parents work here?

4
00:05:37,012 --> 00:05:38,095
你为什么这么想？
Why would you think that?

5
00:05:43,004 --> 00:05:44,065
因为你，我是什么？
Because you're--I'm what?

6
00:05:50,074 --> 00:05:51,083
丽娜？
Leena?

7
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:01,062
放下它。
Put it down.

8
00:06:05,076 --> 00:06:10,007
莉娜，把它放下，现在。
Leena, put it down, now.

9
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:27,056
你没告诉我她是个孩子。
You didn't tell me she was a child.

10
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:29,086
那是因为她不是。
That's because she's not.

11
00:06:30,048 --> 00:06:34,088
莉娜患有腺体疾病
Leena suffers from a gland disorder

12
00:06:35,022 --> 00:06:38,040
这导致了比例侏儒症，
which causes, uh, proportional dwarfism,

13
00:06:38,075 --> 00:06:41,080
实际上，她在10岁左右就停止了生长。
essentially halting her growth around age ten.

14
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:43,079
别搞错了。
Make no mistake.

15
00:06:44,014 --> 00:06:47,001
莉娜看起来像个孩子，但她是个成年女人。
Leena may look like a child, but she is a grown woman.

16
00:06:47,062 --> 00:06:49,054
准确地说是三十一。
Thirty one, to be exact.

17
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:52,015
当莉娜第一次到达时，
When Leena first arrived,

18
00:06:52,024 --> 00:06:55,081
她拼命挣脱束缚
she struggled so hard against her restraints

19
00:06:55,094 --> 00:06:58,055
她会流血不止。
that she would bleed severely.

20
00:07:00,012 --> 00:07:02,034
这对我们所有人都是一个教训
It was a lesson for all of us

21
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:05,047
在她自由意志的深处。
on the depths of her will to be free.

22
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:10,044
丽娜早年的大部分生活
Much of Leena's early life

23
00:07:10,052 --> 00:07:13,009
为了生存，她尽了一切努力。
was spent doing whatever she could to survive.

24
00:07:13,035 --> 00:07:17,070
但她从未变老，至少在外表上没有。
But she never grew older, at least not on the outside.

25
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:20,048
想象一下你的一生，
Imagine going through your whole life,

26
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:22,062
世界只看到一个孩子。
the world seeing only a child.

27
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:25,080
非常重要的是，你不要那样看待她。
It is very important that you do not see her in that way.

28
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,023
莉娜尽可能多地利用她的痛苦。
Leena uses her affliction as much as she suffers from it.

29
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:34,059
她是个出色的骗子。
She's a exceptional con artist.

30
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:38,038
两年前，莉娜慢慢地走了过来
Two years ago, Leena wormed her way

31
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,076
通过伪装成逃跑者进入这个家庭。
into this family by posing as a runaway.

32
00:07:42,007 --> 00:07:45,060
这个家庭收留了她。他们喂她。他们给她穿上衣服。
This family took her in. They fed her. They clothed her.

33
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,077
通常，莉娜会尽可能地偷东西
Normally, Leena would simply steal whatever she could

34
00:07:48,086 --> 00:07:50,099
然后消失，但这次，
and then disappear, but this time,

35
00:07:51,073 --> 00:07:53,017
她，嗯。。。
she, um...

36
00:07:55,013 --> 00:07:58,005
好吧，让我这样说。
Well, let me put it this way.

37
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:00,061
她现在住在这里。
She lives here now.

38
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:26,042
Idti。
Idti.

39
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:40,017
艾迪！
Idti!

40
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:50,075
她是这样做的。
She does that.

41
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,043
我们还有多久，爸爸？
How much longer have we got, Daddy?

42
00:09:16,099 --> 00:09:18,025
我们还有两分钟亲爱的。
We have two minutes, darling.

43
00:09:18,086 --> 00:09:20,056
你在用心学习我，小萨拉。
You're learning me by heart, little Sara.

44
00:09:21,013 --> 00:09:26,005
不，爸爸。我对你了如指掌。你在我心里。
No, Daddy. I know you by heart. You're inside my heart.

45
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,096
我们会勇敢的，不是吗？
We're gonna be brave, aren't we?

46
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:33,031
是的，爸爸。
Yes, Daddy.

47
00:09:38,097 --> 00:09:41,006
是的，爸爸。莉娜：你好，德米特里。
Yes, Daddy.LEENA: Hello, Dmitri.

48
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,063
你准时到了。
You're on time.

49
00:09:51,098 --> 00:09:53,077
太完美了。
It's perfect.

50
00:10:03,095 --> 00:10:07,061
我不能自己绑这些。
I can't tie these myself.

51
00:10:27,071 --> 00:10:29,097
我想为你做点好事。
I want to do something nice for you.

52
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:32,041
你可以进来。
You can come in.

53
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:35,054
是 啊是 啊
Yeah. Yeah.

54
00:10:42,082 --> 00:10:43,095
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

55
00:11:01,023 --> 00:11:06,024
我爸爸得走了。他几乎每天都会回来。
My daddy has to go away. He'll return most any day.

56
00:11:12,032 --> 00:11:13,058
我做不到。
I can't do it.

57
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:19,055
我现在可以做了。
I can do it now.

58
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:23,090
我随时都可能看到我爸爸回到我身边。
Any moment I may see my daddy coming back to me.

59
00:11:27,099 --> 00:11:29,069
我爸爸得走了。
My daddy has to go away.

60
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:43,044
伊迪，你想要一些糖果吗？
Idti, do you want some candy?

61
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:12,086
艾迪！
Idti!

62
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:50,067
她切断了饲料。
She cut the feed.

63
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:55,029
我很抱歉，安娜。
I'm so sorry, Anna.

64
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:57,086
希望警方能找到她
Hopefully, the police will find her

65
00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:59,090
在其他人受伤之前。
before anyone else is hurt.

66
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:04,073
我敢肯定，这不是我们希望的开始。
Not quite the start we had hoped for, I'm sure.

67
00:15:05,099 --> 00:15:08,030
这工作不适合我。
This job isn't for me.

68
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:25,072
哦，安娜。
Oh, Anna.

69
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:29,033
通常只需要一个。
It usually takes only one.

70
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,034
嗯？
Huh?

71
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,091
不要害怕。我是警察。
Don't be frightened. I am police.

72
00:18:58,001 --> 00:19:01,027
呃，你父母在哪里？
Uh, where are your parents?

73
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:04,032
我父母在美国。
My parents are in America.

74
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,097
甜心，你叫什么名字？
Sw-- sweetheart, what is your name?

75
00:19:11,076 --> 00:19:13,015

干得好伙计谢谢各位。
Great job, pal.Thanks, guys.

95
00:20:24,088 --> 00:20:25,093
你认为你会呆多久？
How long do you think you'll be?

96
00:20:26,036 --> 00:20:29,032
事实上，今晚有一群人在一起。
Actually, a bunch of people are getting together tonight.

97
00:20:29,058 --> 00:20:30,084
恭喜你。
Well, congrats.

98
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:32,080
我会在家里等你们。
I'll, uh, see you guys back at the house.

99
00:20:35,054 --> 00:20:37,041
我是说，这应该是家庭之夜。
I mean, this was supposed to be family night.

100
00:20:37,071 --> 00:20:39,080
什么，他不应该和朋友们一起玩吗？
What, is he not supposed to have fun with his friends?

101
00:20:39,089 --> 00:20:41,081
哦，天哪。他所做的就是玩得开心。
Oh, God. All he does is have fun.

102
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:44,089
不，甘纳工作得很辛苦。
No, Gunnar works his tail off.

103
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:47,025
当他不学习的时候，他在击剑。
When he's not studying, he's fencing.

104
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:49,038
他过着自己的生活。
He's living his life.

105
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:55,043
不要那样做。不要进入你的头脑。
Don't do that. Don't go into your head.

106
00:20:55,078 --> 00:20:58,035
我需要你在场。甘纳需要你。
I need you to be present. Gunnar needs you.

107
00:20:58,043 --> 00:21:00,030
哦，对不起。我没有参加那场比赛吗？
Oh, sorry. Was I not at that match?

108
00:21:00,048 --> 00:21:02,005
埃丝特不会回来了，艾伦。
Esther's not coming back, Allen.

109
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:05,074
我也想念她。我愿意。
I miss her too. I do.

110

每天的每一刻。
Every moment of every day.

111
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:13,097
他在这里干什么？
What is he doing here?

112
00:21:25,063 --> 00:21:26,067
你好，艾伦。
Hello, Allen.

113
00:21:26,094 --> 00:21:28,094
我们有你女儿埃丝特的最新消息。
We have an update on your daughter Esther.

114
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:57,010
从埃丝特那里得到的一点点，
From the little we've gotten from Esther,

115
00:21:57,019 --> 00:21:59,085
我们相信是一个女人绑架了她，把她带到了俄罗斯
we believe a woman abducted her, brought her to Russia

116
00:21:59,093 --> 00:22:01,045
把她当成自己的孩子
and passed her off as her own child

117
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:03,037
直到埃丝特设法逃跑。
until Esther managed to escape.

118
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:06,002
我们还没有得到很多细节。
We haven't gotten many specifics yet.

119
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,098
也许当她觉得安全的时候，
Perhaps when she's feeling safer,

120
00:22:08,007 --> 00:22:10,007
她可以对她所经历的事情有更多的了解。
she can shed some more light on what she's been through.

121
00:22:10,098 --> 00:22:14,064
我们有一位儿童治疗师，她将与之合作。
We have a child therapist that she'll be working with.

122
00:22:14,086 --> 00:22:15,090
好的
Good.

123
00:22:16,055 --> 00:22:18,012
她现在需要的是她的家人。
What she needs right now is her family.

124
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,047
为变化做好准备。
Be prepared for changes.

125
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,030
四年是孩子成长的很长时间。
Four years is a long time in the development of a child.

126
00:22:47,071 --> 00:22:48,067
埃丝特？
Esther?

127
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:54,024
亲爱的，是我。
Sweetheart, it's me.

128
00:22:56,011 --> 00:22:57,029
是妈妈。
It's Mommy.

129
00:23:04,077 --> 00:23:07,008
我能看见你吗？
Can I-- can I see you?

130
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:28,027
亲爱的，这是--
Sweetie, it's--

131
00:23:28,071 --> 00:23:29,071
是妈妈。
it's Mommy.

132
00:23:38,011 --> 00:23:39,081
我以为我再也见不到你了。
I thought I would never see you again.

133
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:44,077
现在一切都好了。
Everything is right, now.

134
00:23:48,004 --> 00:23:50,048
你很久没见到我们了。
It's been so long since you've seen any of us.

135
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,092
让我们看看我能不能——哦，爸爸来了。
Let's see if I can-- Oh, there's Daddy.

136
00:23:55,061 --> 00:23:57,057
这是我们的慈善活动之一。
This was one of our charity events.

137
00:23:57,096 --> 00:23:59,070
那天晚上他看起来很帅，不是吗？
He looked so handsome that night, didn't he?

138
00:23:59,087 --> 00:24:00,091
空姐：我能给你拿点别的吗？
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Can I grab you anything else?

139
00:24:01,044 --> 00:24:02,044
不，谢谢。
No, thanks.

140
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:06,018
哦，说到魔鬼。
Oh, speak of the devil.

141
00:24:06,031 --> 00:24:09,036
你哥哥可能比你记得的高一英尺。
Your brother is probably a foot taller than you would remember.

142
00:24:11,045 --> 00:24:14,015
哦，有一个Mup Mup。她对我们很好。
Oh, there's Mup-Mup. She's been so good to us.

143
00:24:14,054 --> 00:24:15,098
哦，我等不及要见她了。
Oh, I can't wait to see her.

144
00:24:18,033 --> 00:24:19,051
不，亲爱的。
No, sweetie.

145
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:24,077
她过去了。回想起现在只有我们四个人了。
She passed. Remember? It's just the four of us now.

146
00:24:26,081 --> 00:24:28,029
我得上厕所。
I have to use the restroom.

147
00:24:34,082 --> 00:24:36,078
呃，洗手间在那边吗？
Uh, is the restroom over there?

148
00:24:36,087 --> 00:24:38,070
不，就在那边。
No, it's just right back over there.

149
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:40,035
在后面？哦，嗯。
Over in the back? Oh.Mm-hmm.

150
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,026
非常感谢。服务员：不客气。
Thank you.ATTENDANT: You're welcome.

151
00:24:54,014 --> 00:24:57,006
“迫不及待地想见到她。”太蠢了。
"Can't wait to see her." So stupid.

152
00:25:21,017 --> 00:25:23,061
哦，爸爸和甘纳就在楼下。
Oh, Daddy and Gunnar are just downstairs.

153
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,070
你认为父亲会认出我吗？
Do you think Father will recognize me?

154
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:32,018
呃，如果你一直叫他“父亲”，也许不会
Uh, maybe not if you keep calling him "father."

155
00:25:32,071 --> 00:25:34,071
爸爸崔西亚：是的，这样更好。
Dad. TRICIA: Yeah, that's better.

156
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:39,032
在这里让我看看你。
Here. Let me look at you.

157
00:25:41,024 --> 00:25:42,098
哦，天哪。你看起来。。。
Oh, my God. You look...

158
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:47,050
像个小姑娘。你已经长大了很多。
like a little lady. You've grown up so much.

159
00:25:49,098 --> 00:25:51,029
把这个脱下来。
Take this off.

160
00:25:52,073 --> 00:25:55,008
这样更好。它不那么严肃。
That's better. It's less austere.

161
00:25:56,069 --> 00:25:57,074
这是--
This is--

162
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:07,069
很抱歉不，对不起。我--
Sorry.No, I-- I'm sorry. I--

163
00:26:08,087 --> 00:26:11,057
来吧，我们走吧。
Come on. Let's go.

164
00:26:32,077 --> 00:26:34,090
我想我很紧张。
I think I'm nervous.

165
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:37,060
好吧，这是一大步。
All right, big step.

166
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,043
爸爸？
Daddy?

167
00:26:43,047 --> 00:26:44,060
我很抱歉。
I'm so sorry.

168
00:26:46,008 --> 00:26:47,060
不敢相信真的是你。
Can't believe it's really you.

169
00:26:57,057 --> 00:27:00,023
我一直都知道。我一直都知道。
I always knew. I always knew.

170
00:27:05,097 --> 00:27:07,006
你好，甘纳。
Hello, Gunnar.

171
00:27:08,024 --> 00:27:09,055
嘿
Hey.

172
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:12,037
我想我们可以做得比“嘿”好一点
I think we could do a little bit better than, "Hey."

173
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:14,064
你不这么认为吗？艾伦：来吧。
Don't you think?ALLEN: Come.

174
00:27:20,051 --> 00:27:22,034
很高兴你回来了。
Glad you're back.

175
00:27:22,077 --> 00:27:23,095
我也是。
Me, too.

176
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:27,086
我们回家怎么样？莉娜：是的。
How about we go home, huh?LEENA: Yes.

177
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:29,078
我们回家吧。
Let's go home.

178
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:14,048
欢迎回家，埃丝特。
Welcome home, Esther.

179
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,081
我们就这样离开了。
We left it just as it was.

180
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,059
我们一直都知道你会回家的。
We always knew you would come back home.

181
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:39,093
隐马尔可夫模型。
Hmm.

182
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,090
我的意思是，你可能已经长大了很多，
I mean, you've probably outgrown so much,

183
00:28:43,003 --> 00:28:45,055
但是我们有很多圣诞节和生日
but we have a lot of Christmases and birthdays

184
00:28:45,064 --> 00:28:46,069
为了弥补，
to make up for,

185
00:28:46,081 --> 00:28:49,046
让我们知道你在干什么，
so just let us know what you're into,

186
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,025
你可能会得到它。
and you might get it.

187
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:55,004
我喜欢画画。你喜欢画画吗？
I like painting.You like to paint?

188
00:28:55,047 --> 00:28:57,052
你以前从未对绘画感兴趣。
You were never interested in painting before.

189
00:28:58,004 --> 00:28:59,004
也许你们两个
Well, maybe you two

190
00:28:59,013 --> 00:29:00,096
可以花一些时间在你的工作室。
can spend some time in your studio.

191
00:29:01,004 --> 00:29:02,030
没有什么能让我更快乐。
Nothing would make me happier.

192
00:29:12,097 --> 00:29:15,080
所以，嗯，计划是，
So, um, plan is,

193
00:29:15,093 --> 00:29:17,058
明天你要和西格医生谈谈。
tomorrow you're gonna talk to Dr. Segar.

194
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,010
你还记得她吗？
Do you remember her?

195
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:23,042
她有只鹦鹉叫悉尼。
She had the parrot named Sydney.Mm-hmm.

196
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,090
可以
Okay.

197
00:29:25,037 --> 00:29:26,076
如果你需要什么。。。
Well, if you need anything...

198
00:29:26,085 --> 00:29:28,068
我们就在大厅下面，好吗？
We're right down the hall, all right?

00:30:14,033 --> 00:30:15,072
西格医生马上就来。
Dr. Segar will be right with you.

208
00:30:15,081 --> 00:30:17,016
塞格医生：几分钟后我就要见到她了。
DR. SEGAR: I'm seeing her in a few minutes.

209
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:19,082
我觉得你现在介入还为时过早警探。
I think it's too soon for you to get involved, Detective.

210
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:21,077
我想先和她单独谈谈。
I'd like to talk to her alone first.

211
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,065
听着，我得走了。
Look, I have to go.

212
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,045
西格尔博士：你不知道
DR. SEGAR: You have no idea

213
00:30:39,053 --> 00:30:41,036
见到你我真高兴埃丝特。
how happy I am to see you, Esther.

214
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,028
欢迎回家。
Welcome home.

215
00:30:44,036 --> 00:30:48,010
好吧，现在，你肯定不是我曾经认识的那个小女孩了。
Well, now, you're certainly not the little girl I once knew.

216
00:30:48,085 --> 00:30:50,020
你现在是个年轻女士了。
You're a young lady now.

217
00:30:52,037 --> 00:30:53,037
你还记得我告诉你的吗
Do you remember what I told you

218
00:30:53,046 --> 00:30:54,098
我们第一次开会是什么时候？
when we first began our sessions?

219
00:30:57,012 --> 00:30:58,047
我告诉过你如果我问任何问题
I told you if I ask any questions

220
00:30:58,055 --> 00:31:00,073
那会让你不舒服，我们会停下来。
that make you uncomfortable, we'll stop.

221
00:31:01,064 --> 00:31:03,038
我希望我的父母像你一样。
I wish my parents were like you.

222
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:05,074
为什么呢
How so?

223
00:31:06,008 --> 00:31:08,008
他们一直问我发生了什么，
They keep asking what happened to me,

224
00:31:08,052 --> 00:31:11,022
但我还没准备好告诉他们。
but I'm not ready to tell them about it.

225
00:31:11,043 --> 00:31:12,065
塞格医生：那很好。
DR. SEGAR: And that's perfectly fine.

226
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:14,097
我希望你能跟我谈谈，
I am hoping you'll talk to me about it,

227
00:31:15,031 --> 00:31:17,027
但只有当你准备好了，好吗？
but only when you're ready, okay?

228
00:31:18,035 --> 00:31:19,057
话虽如此，
Having said that,

229
00:31:20,057 --> 00:31:21,066
你有什么要告诉我的吗
is there anything you want to tell me

230
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:24,018
关于你离开的时间？
about your time away?

231
00:31:24,053 --> 00:31:26,005
你想玩吗，悉尼？
You want to play, Sydney?

232
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:28,071
我想悉尼想和我一起玩。
I think Sydney wants to play with me.

233
00:31:28,084 --> 00:31:30,093
你好，我记得你。
Hello, I remember you.

234
00:31:31,054 --> 00:31:32,080
你还记得我吗？
You remember me?

235
00:31:35,011 --> 00:31:37,007
塞格医生：轮到你了。埃丝特，你可以在外面等。
DR. SEGAR: Your turn. Esther, you can wait out here.

236
00:31:37,024 --> 00:31:39,011
我只是想和你妈妈谈谈。
I'm just going to need to talk to your mom for a moment.

237
00:31:56,035 --> 00:31:58,061
你好，你好。
Hello.Hi.

238
00:31:59,031 --> 00:32:00,049
我喜欢你的耳环。
I like your earrings.

239
00:32:00,088 --> 00:32:02,049
哦，谢谢你，亲爱的。
Oh, thank you, honey.

240
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:06,080
你在写什么？哦，对不起。我很抱歉。
What are you writing? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

241
00:32:06,088 --> 00:32:08,053
没关系。莉娜：对不起。
It's okay.LEENA: I'm sorry.

242
00:32:08,071 --> 00:32:10,041
让我去把这个弄干净。
Let me go get this cleaned up.

243
00:32:20,024 --> 00:32:22,029
SEGAR医生：她看起来和你记得的一样？
DR. SEGAR: She seem the same as you remember?

244
00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:23,059
不同的
Different?

245
00:32:24,016 --> 00:32:27,056
她当然不一样了。
Well, of course she's different.

246
00:32:27,099 --> 00:32:29,034
塞格医生：她现在有口音了。
DR. SEGAR: She has an accent now.

247
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:33,004
考虑到她去过哪里，这不寻常吗？
Is that unusual, considering where she's been?

248
00:32:34,091 --> 00:32:36,026
塞格博士：不一定。
DR. SEGAR: Not necessarily.

249
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,087
她演讲时在那儿呆了很长时间
She was there a long time when her speech

250
00:32:37,096 --> 00:32:39,057
仍在发展中。
was still developing.

251
00:32:39,065 --> 00:32:42,031
但我要告诉你，她的身体状况要好得多
But I will tell you, she is in far better shape

252
00:32:42,048 --> 00:32:44,096
在智力和情感上都比我预期的要高。
intellectually and emotionally than I would expect.

253
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,084
那很好，对吧？
Well, that's good, right?

254
00:32:52,045 --> 00:32:54,063
塞格博士：我确实注意到了一些不一致之处。
DR. SEGAR: I did notice some inconsistencies.

255
00:32:54,093 --> 00:32:56,076
例如，她说那是悉尼。
For example, she said that was Sydney.

256
00:32:57,028 --> 00:32:58,041
悉尼是一只金刚鹦鹉。
Sydney was a macaw.

257
00:32:58,054 --> 00:33:00,063
明亮的橙色和四倍的大小。
Bright orange and four times the size.

258
00:33:00,076 --> 00:33:02,094
然而，今天，她把这只鸟叫做悉尼
Yet, today, she addressed this bird as Sydney

259
00:33:03,002 --> 00:33:05,094
满怀信心。崔西亚：你在说什么？
with complete confidence.TRICIA: What are you getting at?

260
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,077
西格尔博士：对我来说，这就像一场表演。
DR. SEGAR: To me, it felt like a performance.

261
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,069
他打了我，撕破了我的衣服！
He hit me and ripped my dress!

262
00:33:14,043 --> 00:33:15,091
我想回家。
I want to go home.

263
00:33:17,013 --> 00:33:18,018
塞格医生：今天就够了。
DR. SEGAR: That's enough for today.

264
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,095
嗯，当然。我们会重新安排。
Uh, of course. We'll reschedule.

265
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:42,037
埃丝特，你没事吧？嗯,对。
Esther, you all right?Uh, yes.

266
00:33:54,016 --> 00:33:55,055
嘿
Hey.

267
00:33:56,008 --> 00:33:58,082
莫蒂西亚，帮我找甘纳，好吗？
Morticia, get Gunnar for me, would you?

268
00:33:59,025 --> 00:34:02,069
你叫我什么？迈克，那是她。姐姐。
What did you call me?Mike, that's her. The sister.

269
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:04,043
噢，见鬼。
Oh, shit.

270
00:34:04,052 --> 00:34:08,061
这是我的错。嗯，去找冈纳，波扎卢斯塔。
It's my bad. Um, get Gunnar, pozálujsta.

271
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:19,010
那是西班牙语还是什么？我不知道--
Is that Spanish or something? I don't--

272
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:20,045
嘿，我们走吧。
Hey, let's go.

273
00:34:21,028 --> 00:34:22,085
你妹妹他妈的在旅行，伙计。
Your sister's a fuckin' trip, man.

274
00:34:23,002 --> 00:34:24,098
说真的，伙计？我爸爸就在那里。
Seriously, dude? My dad is right there.

275
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:26,024
我不在乎。古纳：迈克！
I don't care.GUNNAR: Mike!

276
00:34:27,028 --> 00:34:29,007
他妈的白痴。迈克：我就是我。
Fucking idiot.MIKE: I am what I am.

277
00:34:29,076 --> 00:34:32,050
嘿，亲爱的，你没事吧？
Hey, honey, you okay?

278
00:34:33,046 --> 00:34:35,098
呃，我的衣服坏了。艾伦：我给你买一个新的。
Uh, my dress is ruined.ALLEN: I'll buy you a new one.

279
00:34:36,047 --> 00:34:37,065
我在想，呃，
I was thinking, uh,

280
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:39,003
我在想我们可以去演播室。
I was thinking we could go to the studio.

281
00:34:39,064 --> 00:34:40,086
我很乐意。
I would love to.

282
00:34:52,013 --> 00:34:53,035
如果我不知道的话，
If I didn't know any better,

283
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,096
我想你以前从没来过这里。
I'd think you'd never been in here before.

284
00:34:58,084 --> 00:35:00,019
如此美丽。
So beautiful.

285
00:35:05,006 --> 00:35:06,037
这盏灯是干什么用的？
What's the light for?

286
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:09,011
这盏灯是干什么用的？莉娜：嗯。
What's the light for?LEENA: Mm-hmm.

287
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:12,076
你不记得了？这就是你爸爸出名的原因。
You don't remember? It's what your papa's famous for.

288
00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:14,077
隐马尔可夫模型。
Hmm.

289
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,090
在这里
Here.

290
00:35:17,068 --> 00:35:18,081
按这个。
Press on this.

291
00:35:25,008 --> 00:35:27,074
是的，我总是想把这么多东西放在一张画布上，
Yeah, I always tried to fit so much into one canvas,

292
00:35:27,082 --> 00:35:31,004
你知道的？所以，我求助于一个隐藏层。
you know? So, I resorted to a-- a hidden layer.

293
00:35:32,017 --> 00:35:33,074
什么都不是一回事，对吧？
Nothing is ever just one thing, right?

294
00:35:33,087 --> 00:35:35,018
太酷了。
So cool.

295
00:35:37,022 --> 00:35:38,087
你有一阵子没来过这里了。
You haven't been in here in a while.

296
00:35:40,001 --> 00:35:41,014
不，我没有。
No, I haven't.

297
00:35:45,058 --> 00:35:46,058
这是什么？
What's this one?

298
00:35:51,076 --> 00:35:52,094
哦，不。
Oh, no.

299
00:35:54,094 --> 00:35:57,003
我应该把它处理掉。
It's, uh, I should've gotten rid of this.

300
00:35:57,068 --> 00:35:59,016
谁是谁？
Who-- who's-- who's that?

301
00:36:00,064 --> 00:36:02,008
沉湎于过去是没有用的。
There's no use dwelling on the past.

302
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,003
你现在回家了。这才是最重要的，对吗？
You're home now. That's all that matters, right?

303
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,060
所以，我想我们可以擦掉一些画布，你知道吗？
So, I was thinking we could dust off some canvasses, you know?

304
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:09,073
看看结果如何。
See what comes of it.

305
00:36:09,082 --> 00:36:10,087
我很乐意，是吗？
I would love to.Yeah?

306
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:14,021
嗯，你的毒药是什么？油画，水彩画？
Um, what's your poison? Oil, watercolors?

307
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,091
我都明白了，木炭？
I-- I got it all.Charcoal?

308
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:17,070
木炭可以
Charcoal? Okay.

309
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:20,022
挑一个物体，然后我们坐下来
Pick an object, and-- and we'll sit down

310
00:36:20,031 --> 00:36:21,088
我们一起画。
and we'll-- we'll draw it together.

311
00:36:22,088 --> 00:36:24,010
我想画你。
I want to draw you.

312
00:36:26,014 --> 00:36:27,049
你想画我吗？嗯。
You want to draw me?Mm-hmm.

313
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:29,010
好的。
Yeah, okay.

314
00:36:32,036 --> 00:36:33,067
这是第一次。
Well, this is a first.

315
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,084
你想要我怎么样？
How do you want me?

316
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:37,076
我能，我能做思想者。
I can-- I can do The Thinker.

317
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:40,029
你当时的样子。
The way you were when you were looking at that.

318
00:36:42,046 --> 00:36:44,016
那不是我想住的地方了。
That's not a place I want to live anymore.

319
00:36:44,081 --> 00:36:46,016
那里
There.

320
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:48,021
就这样。
Just like that.

321
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,087
你在那里学画画的？
You learned to paint while you were over there?

322
00:36:57,043 --> 00:36:58,048
嗯。
Mm-hmm.

323
00:37:03,018 --> 00:37:05,097
你只是画画，还是也画--
Would you just draw, or was it-- was it also--

324
00:37:06,009 --> 00:37:07,027
不是你想的那样。
It wasn't what you think.

325
00:37:09,053 --> 00:37:11,018
尽管发生了一切，它仍在发生
It's still happening, despite everything

326
00:37:11,027 --> 00:37:14,097
这是怎么回事，艾伦？不，他不在那里。
that's going on. Allen? No, he won't be there.

327
00:37:15,006 --> 00:37:16,098
你知道他对这些事情的感觉。
You know how he feels about these things.

328
00:37:17,028 --> 00:37:19,046
那么，明天的晚会上见，好吗？
So, I'll see you at the gala tomorrow, then, okay?

329
00:37:19,054 --> 00:37:20,072
这是为了一个好的理由。
It's for a good cause.

330
00:37:21,006 --> 00:37:24,002
贝丝，带上你的支票簿和吉姆。
Beth, just bring your checkbook and Jim.

331
00:37:24,015 --> 00:37:26,011
看在上帝的份上，这是为了儿科癌症。
It's for pediatric cancer, for Christ's sake.

332
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:29,042
好吧，这样更好。非常感谢。
Okay, that's better. Thank you.

333
00:37:37,073 --> 00:37:38,078
我完了。
I'm finished.

334
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:40,022
已经嗯。
Already?Mm-hmm.

335
00:37:46,074 --> 00:37:48,031
你喜欢吗？艾伦：我喜欢。
Do you like it?ALLEN: I love it.

336
00:37:48,061 --> 00:37:50,018
太不可思议了。
It's-- it's incredible.

337
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:53,014
好的，30秒，好吗？
Okay, 30 seconds, all right?

338
00:37:53,027 --> 00:37:54,092
然后我们会看看你能用油漆做什么。
And then we're gonna see what you can do with paint.

339
00:38:34,027 --> 00:38:37,001
这是私人的。哦，对不起。
That's private.Oh, I'm sorry.

340
00:38:37,018 --> 00:38:39,036
我看到你把它带回来了。
I-- I saw that you brought it back with you.

341
00:38:39,045 --> 00:38:40,080
我觉得很特别。你不敲门吗？
I thought it was special.You don't knock?

342
00:38:42,006 --> 00:38:45,033
我在找我的金表。
I was looking for, um, my gold watch.

343
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,093
没关系。我相信它会出现的。
I-- It's okay. I'm sure it'll turn up.

344
00:38:48,024 --> 00:38:49,029
很抱歉
Sorry.

345
00:39:15,031 --> 00:39:16,075
“以斯帖的财产。”
"Property of Esther."

346
00:39:19,092 --> 00:39:21,057
“妈妈把我带到邪恶的地方。”
"Mummy took me to Wicked."

347
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:24,066
“妈妈”你好，妈妈。
"Mummy." Hello, Mummy.

348
00:39:26,028 --> 00:39:27,037
谢谢你，妈妈。
Thank you, Mummy.

349
00:39:29,085 --> 00:39:31,003
我知道，妈妈。
I know, Mummy.

350
00:39:32,011 --> 00:39:33,016
妈咪
Mummy.

351
00:39:34,024 --> 00:39:36,068
妈咪
Mummy.

352
00:39:44,003 --> 00:39:45,077
你不会相信埃丝特能做什么。
You're not gonna believe what Esther can do.

353
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,074
我们在演播室度过了下午。
We spent the afternoon in the studio.

354
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,031
她画了一幅我的肖像。
She drew a portrait of me.

355
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:53,083
她比我20多岁时更有天赋。
She's got more talent than I had when I was in my 20s.

356
00:39:54,013 --> 00:39:55,035
这怎么可能？
How's that possible?

357
00:39:55,048 --> 00:39:57,044
四年前，她还在画木棍。
Four years ago, she was still drawing stick figures.

358
00:39:57,053 --> 00:39:58,088
容易的古纳：什么？
Easy.GUNNAR: What?

359
00:39:59,001 --> 00:40:00,093
想想四年前你在哪里。
Think about where you were four years ago.

360
00:40:01,014 --> 00:40:04,084
现在你是击剑冠军了。是的，只是，真是令人印象深刻。
Now you're a fencing champion.Yeah, just-- It's impressive.

361
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,027
隐马尔可夫模型。
Hmm.

362
00:40:06,058 --> 00:40:07,084
也许你可以给我画一幅肖像。
Maybe you can make a portrait of me.

363
00:40:08,093 --> 00:40:10,041
这很好吃，妈妈。
This is delicious, Mummy.

364
00:40:11,058 --> 00:40:12,058
非常感谢。
Thank you.

365
00:40:15,063 --> 00:40:16,063
有什么问题吗？
Is something wrong?

366
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,016
不，不，我只是--
No, no. I'm just--

367
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:22,085
你在等某人吗？
You expecting someone?

368
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:31,069
我想我会去。。。
I thought I'd pop in to...

369
00:40:33,017 --> 00:40:34,043
看看谁来了。
Look who came for a visit.

370
00:40:34,061 --> 00:40:36,039
哦，很抱歉打断你的晚餐。
Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt dinner.

371
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:38,044
这是一名警官
This is a police officer

372
00:40:38,052 --> 00:40:40,004
你失踪时是谁帮助我们的。
who helped us when you went missing.

373
00:40:40,018 --> 00:40:41,023
他是我的朋友。
He's a friend.

374
00:40:41,053 --> 00:40:44,005
我只是来欢迎你回家埃丝特。
I just, uh, came to say welcome home, Esther.

375
00:40:44,092 --> 00:40:46,014
非常感谢。
Thank you.

376
00:40:49,036 --> 00:40:51,015
打扰一下。
Excuse me for a moment.

377
00:40:56,006 --> 00:40:59,024
你应该知道，嗯，我们的儿童心理学家觉得
You should know, um, our child psychologist feels

378
00:40:59,033 --> 00:41:02,042
埃丝特应该在他的范围内讲述她的故事--
Esther should tell her story within the confines of--

379
00:41:02,055 --> 00:41:03,094
而不是和我这样的警察在一起。
And not with a cop like me.

380
00:41:04,007 --> 00:41:05,033
别担心。我明白了。
Don't worry. I get it.

381
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:08,077
但埃丝特确实从我们的小镇上消失了，
But Esther did vanish from our little town,

382
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,051
这仍然是一个令人关切的问题。
and that remains a concern.

383
00:41:11,082 --> 00:41:13,060
我需要知道是否还有危险。
I need to know if there's still a danger.

384
00:41:14,086 --> 00:41:16,099
今天早上我和西格医生谈过了。
I spoke to Dr. Segar this morning.

385
00:41:17,078 --> 00:41:20,000
这样合适吗？
Is that appropriate?

386
00:41:20,035 --> 00:41:21,061
她告诉我她是开放的
She told me she's open

387
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:23,096
为了明天早上的小组讨论，
to group discussion tomorrow morning,

388
00:41:24,009 --> 00:41:25,087
只是想看看是否一切都好。
just to see if everything's all right.

389
00:41:26,009 --> 00:41:29,009
妈妈，你的晚会是明天。
Mummy, your gala is tomorrow.

390
00:41:32,045 --> 00:41:33,089
那我们第二天再做。
We'll do it the following day, then.

391
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,019
这很重要。
It's important.

392
00:41:35,054 --> 00:41:37,080
我是说，当然。如果有那么重要，我们会去的。
I mean, sure. If it's that important, we'll be there.

393
00:41:40,076 --> 00:41:42,033
你忘了把杯子倒满。
You forgot to fill your glass.

394
00:41:46,007 --> 00:41:49,016
欢迎回家，埃丝特。
Well, uh, welcome home, Esther.

395
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,095
你已经说过了。
You said that already.

396
00:41:51,003 --> 00:41:53,042
埃丝特，没关系。她是对的。
Esther--Oh, it's okay. She's right.

397
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,051
我陪你出去。
I'll walk you out.

398
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:28,054
很抱歉你住在这里。
I'm sorry you live here.

399
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,060
是 啊
Yeah.

400
00:43:28,021 --> 00:43:29,060
我想我会在这里呆一段时间。
I think I'll stay here for a while.

401
00:44:01,003 --> 00:44:03,051
我想西格医生出了什么事。
I think something's going on with Dr. Segar.

402
00:44:03,095 --> 00:44:05,091
在我们上次会面时，她似乎在暗示
She seemed to be implying in our last meeting

403
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:08,065
埃丝特在撒谎。
that Esther is lying.

404
00:44:09,026 --> 00:44:10,039
那太疯狂了。
That's insane.

405
00:44:11,021 --> 00:44:13,008
也许她需要看心理医生。
Maybe she needs to see a therapist.

406
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:14,026
我知道，对吧？
I know, right?

407
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:18,039
这是什么？
What-- what is this?

408
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:19,088
这是你的约会。
Your date.

409
00:44:20,018 --> 00:44:21,096
你要来吗？是的，我当然会来。
You're coming?Yeah, of course I'm coming.

410
00:44:22,005 --> 00:44:24,084
你是我的妻子。我可以帮你对付几个有钱人。
You're my wife. I can deal with a few rich pricks for you.

411
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,053
埃丝特呢？
And what about Esther?

412
00:44:26,066 --> 00:44:28,075
嗯，甘纳来了。她会没事的，对吧？
Well, Gunnar's here. She'll be fine, right?

413
00:44:29,036 --> 00:44:30,054
什么，你想让我呆在家里吗？
What, do you want me to stay home?

414
00:44:30,076 --> 00:44:32,015
不，不。
No, no.

415
00:44:34,076 --> 00:44:38,089
哦，你知道，自从我们把埃丝特救回来后，
Oh, you know, it seems like since we got Esther back,

416
00:44:40,016 --> 00:44:41,064
我们也回来了。
we got us back, too.

417
00:44:42,077 --> 00:44:43,090
我完全同意。
I couldn't agree more.

418
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:46,047
你需要多长时间穿衣服？
How long do you need to get dressed?

419
00:44:46,081 --> 00:44:48,042
我可以快点，是吗？
I can be quick.Yeah?

420
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:53,022
我也可以很快。
I can be quick, too.

421
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:02,070
对不起，但它们很可爱。
I'm sorry, but they're cute.

422
00:45:31,082 --> 00:45:33,000
我们把门关上。
Let's just close the door.

423
00:45:38,047 --> 00:45:39,073
把门关上。
Just close the door.

424
00:45:40,004 --> 00:45:45,061
什么不，不，不！
What? No. No, no, no!

425
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:46,092
哦，天哪。
Oh, my God.

426
00:45:47,001 --> 00:45:48,075
你知道我花了多少钱买这件衣服吗？
Do you know how much I spent on this dress?

427
00:45:50,005 --> 00:45:51,040
让我看看。哦，伙计。
Let me look.Oh, man.

428
00:45:51,057 --> 00:45:52,075
我可以解决这个问题。
I can fix that.

429
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:55,058
用安全别针。对，或订书钉。
With a safety pin.Right, or staples.

430
00:45:55,067 --> 00:45:56,076
史泰博会有用的。
Staples would work.

431
00:46:02,019 --> 00:46:04,019
你有责任照顾你妹妹
You're responsible for looking after your sister

432
00:46:04,028 --> 00:46:07,015
当我们离开的时候。我们相信你，好吗？
while we're gone. We're trusting you, okay?

433
00:46:07,024 --> 00:46:08,033
是的，爸爸。我得到了它。
Yeah, Dad. I got it.

434
00:46:10,042 --> 00:46:11,055
你看起来棒极了。
You look incredible.

435
00:46:12,064 --> 00:46:13,068
我们出发了。
We're off.

436
00:46:14,025 --> 00:46:15,073
可能要到午夜后才能回家，好吗？
Probably won't be home until after midnight, okay?

437
00:46:15,082 --> 00:46:17,047
所以，不要让她熬夜太晚。
So, don't let her stay up too late.

438
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:19,030
你有钥匙吗？
You have the keys?

439
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:20,052
收到，嗯。
Copy that.Hmm.

440
00:46:28,005 --> 00:46:30,040
你看起来不错。崔西亚：谢谢。
You look nice.TRICIA: Thanks.

441
00:46:32,053 --> 00:46:33,058
祝你晚安，亲爱的。
Have a good night, honey.

442
00:46:34,075 --> 00:46:35,088
再见，晚安。
Ciao.Night.

443
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:42,037
那我们该怎么办？
So what are we going to do?

444
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:46,055

451
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:14,027
我抓得太久了。
I was holding onto it for too long.

452

可以那么，贡纳，
Okay. So, Gunnar,

453
00:47:16,009 --> 00:47:17,083
你妹妹和你记忆中的不同吗？
is your sister different than you remember?

454
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:19,049
迈克：你觉得怎么样？

455
00:47:19,058 --> 00:47:21,097
她去过东欧的性集中营。

迈克。

457
00:47:24,015 --> 00:47:26,059
但是，嗯，是的。不，她，呃，她不一样，好吧。
But, uh, yeah. No, she, uh, she's different, all right.

00:47:26,071 --> 00:47:28,067
她现在有口音了。
She's got an accent now.

459
00:47:29,006 --> 00:47:30,076
她穿着像莉齐·波登。
And she dresses like Lizzie Borden.

460
00:47:30,089 --> 00:47:32,041
真他妈的奇怪。
It's so fucking weird.

461
00:47:32,098 --> 00:47:34,024
莉齐·波登是谁？
Who's Lizzie Borden?

462
00:47:37,033 --> 00:47:38,094
♪ 沙拉拉。。。

463
00:47:39,016 --> 00:47:42,012
一个疯狂的小妞用斧头杀了她的父母。
Some crazy chick who killed her parents with an axe.

464
00:47:42,021 --> 00:47:43,095
呃，嘿，埃丝特，
Uh, hey, Esther,

465
00:47:44,082 --> 00:47:48,056
你为什么不去看电影什么的？
why don't you, uh, go watch a movie or something?

466
00:47:48,078 --> 00:47:49,091
不
No.

467
00:47:50,043 --> 00:47:52,074
埃丝特，这不是你的戏。
Esther, this isn't your scene.

468
00:47:53,044 --> 00:47:56,018
去看电影。去他妈的。
Go watch a movie.Go fuck yourself.

469
00:47:58,027 --> 00:47:59,032
嘿，甘纳，你知道吗？我喜欢她。
Hey, Gunnar, you know what? I like her.

470
00:47:59,049 --> 00:48:00,093
哦
Oh.

471
00:48:03,027 --> 00:48:04,040
去
Go.

472
00:48:07,036 --> 00:48:09,041
无论如何，干杯！女孩2：干杯。
Anyway, cheers!GIRL 2: Cheers.

473
00:48:09,054 --> 00:48:10,080
是 啊我他妈的要为此干杯。
Yeah. I'll fucking drink to that.

474
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:16,055
嗯，我们在说什么？
Um, what we were talking about?

475
00:48:16,068 --> 00:48:18,025
那是谁？
Who's that?

476
00:48:21,081 --> 00:48:22,086
傍晚
Evening.

477
00:48:24,051 --> 00:48:28,017
嘿，我父母不在这里。他们在妈妈的晚会上。
Hey, my parents aren't here. They're at Mom's gala.

478
00:48:28,095 --> 00:48:30,052
真倒霉甘纳：是的。
Just my luck.GUNNAR: Yeah.

479
00:48:30,091 --> 00:48:32,017
开派对？
Having a party?

480
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:34,026
不，只是几个朋友。
No, it's just a few friends.

481
00:48:34,035 --> 00:48:36,013
闻闻街上的杂草。
Smell the weed from the street.

482
00:48:36,091 --> 00:48:39,004
什么嗯，我不知道--
What? Um, I don't know--

483
00:48:39,013 --> 00:48:40,022
我不知道你在说什么。
I don't know what you're talking about.

484
00:48:40,031 --> 00:48:44,071
听着，这里什么都没发生，好吗？
Um, look, nothing's going on here, okay?

485
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:46,083
那我为什么不直接告诉我父母
So um, why don't I just tell my parents

486
00:48:46,092 --> 00:48:50,005
你来过我们可以忘掉这一切。
that you stopped by, and we can just forget all about this.

487
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,093
凉的
Cool?

488
00:48:52,063 --> 00:48:54,081
很酷，很好。
Cool.Good.

489
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:59,020
你介意我去洗手间吗？
You mind if I hit the restroom before I go?

490
00:49:00,033 --> 00:49:02,055
是的，随便。是的，当然。
Yeah, whatever. Yeah, sure.

491
00:50:22,011 --> 00:50:23,042
那是一场爆炸。
That was a blast.

492
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:25,055
难怪那些紧张的百万富翁排队
No wonder those uptight millionaires line up

493
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:27,007
给基金会钱。
to give the foundation money.

494
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:29,020
哦，不，是酒。
Oh, no. It's the booze.

495
00:50:29,029 --> 00:50:31,064
这不是酒，亲爱的。
It's not the booze, hon.

496
00:50:32,012 --> 00:50:33,016
是主人。
It's the host.

497
00:50:33,047 --> 00:50:34,078
你让人们发挥出最好的一面。
You bring the best out of people.

498
00:50:35,008 --> 00:50:36,004
哦。
Aw.

499
00:50:54,001 --> 00:50:55,071
我只希望这房子还屹立着。
I just hope the house is still standing.

500
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:56,088
啊。
Ugh.

501
00:50:57,014 --> 00:51:00,001
我是说，当我16岁的时候，我几乎。。。
I mean, when I was 16, I-- I nearly...

502
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:02,019
…我差点把房子烧了。
...I nearly burnt the house down.

503
00:51:02,062 --> 00:51:04,006
不，甘纳不会那样做的。
No, Gunnar would never do that.

504
00:51:04,032 --> 00:51:05,093
谁说我说的是甘纳？
Who says I'm talking about Gunnar?

505
00:51:11,007 --> 00:51:12,046
埃丝特，我们到家了。
Esther, we're home.

506
00:51:14,038 --> 00:51:16,008
埃丝特？
Esther?

507
00:52:12,022 --> 00:52:13,066
“萨恩学院？”
"Saarne Institute?"

508
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:26,092
埃丝特？
Esther?

509
00:54:16,025 --> 00:54:19,012
如果你不是埃丝特，你到底是谁？
If you're not Esther, who the hell are you?

510
00:54:35,036 --> 00:54:37,032
你怎么知道我不是埃丝特？
How did you know that I'm not Esther?

511
00:54:43,024 --> 00:54:44,098
她自己的母亲甚至不知道。
Her own mother doesn't even know.

512
00:54:45,093 --> 00:54:49,028
是的，孩子，她喜欢。
Yeah, kid, she does.

513
00:54:59,025 --> 00:55:00,030
该死的。
Damn it.

514
00:55:01,012 --> 00:55:02,012
妈咪
Mummy?

515
00:55:03,013 --> 00:55:04,044
你他妈的在看什么？
The fuck are you looking at?

516
00:55:08,048 --> 00:55:09,087
所以，让我直说吧。
So, let me get this straight.

517
00:55:11,026 --> 00:55:14,009
你是个成年女人还是通缉犯？
You're a grown-ass woman and a wanted criminal?

518
00:55:15,031 --> 00:55:18,036
这简直是一团糟。
That is beyond fucked up.

519
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:24,032
顺便说一句，这就是我所做的一切。
This is all I ever do anymore, by the way.

520
00:55:25,006 --> 00:55:26,045
收拾我的孩子。
Clean up after my kids.

521
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:29,024
别担心。妈妈会处理好的。
Don't worry about it. Mommy'll take care of it.

522
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:31,020
妈妈会照顾好一切。
Mommy takes care of everything.

523
00:55:31,098 --> 00:55:34,064
当Gunnar告诉我Donnan来了，
When Gunnar told me Donnan came to the house,

524
00:55:34,072 --> 00:55:36,011
我知道我会在这里找到你。
I knew I'd find you here.

525
00:55:36,086 --> 00:55:39,078
你本可以抢了我们的钱然后消失
You could have robbed us blind and disappeared

526
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:43,030
第二次你有机会，但你没有。
the second you had a chance, but you didn't.

527
00:55:44,095 --> 00:55:46,008
为什么？
Why is that?

528
00:55:47,047 --> 00:55:52,082
你想的更大，对吗？扮演角色，操纵我们，
You're thinking bigger, right? Play the part, manipulate us,

529
00:55:53,009 --> 00:55:56,031
一年后，我们遇到了一些悲惨的事故。
and a year from now we meet with some tragic accident.

530
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:57,088
我暖和了吗？
Am I getting warm?

531
00:55:58,049 --> 00:56:01,028
让我走。你再也见不到我了。
Let me go. You'll never see me again.

532
00:56:01,071 --> 00:56:03,028
这正是我害怕的。
That's exactly what I'm afraid of.

533
00:56:03,097 --> 00:56:06,071
我们不能让埃丝特消失两次，对吗？
We can't have Esther disappear twice now, can we?

534
00:56:07,084 --> 00:56:09,028
她没有消失。
She didn't disappear.

535
00:56:09,098 --> 00:56:12,011
我无法为她做任何事，
There was nothing that I could do for her,

536
00:56:12,085 --> 00:56:14,003
太晚了。
it was too late.

537
00:56:15,063 --> 00:56:19,046
甘纳，他对她总是太粗暴了。
Gunnar, he was always way too rough with her.

538
00:56:19,099 --> 00:56:23,069
那天晚上他做得太过分了。我该怎么办？
That night he just went too far. What was I supposed to do?

539
00:56:24,069 --> 00:56:27,069
把我剩下的唯一的孩子交出来
Hand over the only child I had left over some

540
00:56:28,025 --> 00:56:30,043
兄弟姐妹的胡说八道太过分了？
sibling bullshit that went too far?

541
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:33,057
我全心全意地爱我的女儿，
I loved my daughter with all my heart,

542
00:56:34,043 --> 00:56:36,091
但是一个母亲保护她的家庭，不管发生什么，
but a mother protects her family, no matter what,

543
00:56:37,044 --> 00:56:40,097
如果你认为…我会让一些
and if you think... ...that I'm going to let some

544
00:56:41,018 --> 00:56:44,044
精神侏儒摧毁我建造的。。。
psycho dwarf destroy what I have built...

545
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,040
你错了。
you're mistaken.

546
00:56:48,006 --> 00:56:50,006
这家人是他妈的五月花号来的
This family came over on the fucking Mayflower

547
00:56:50,015 --> 00:56:54,033
建立了这个国家。我们很重要。艾伦很重要。
and built this country. We matter. Allen matters.

548
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,076
当他得知以斯帖还活着的消息时，
When he got the news Esther was alive,

549
00:56:57,033 --> 00:57:00,090
他脸上的幸福，我必须让这件事成功。
the happiness on his face, I had to make this work.

550
00:57:02,042 --> 00:57:04,073
艾伦不知道埃丝特怎么了。
Allen doesn't know what happened to Esther.

551
00:57:05,003 --> 00:57:08,003
你要帮我确保他永远不会这样做。
And you are gonna help me make sure that he never does.

552
00:57:08,082 --> 00:57:12,000
只有一件事比孩子的死更糟糕，
There's only one thing worse than the death of a child,

553
00:57:12,047 --> 00:57:14,034
那是一个失踪的孩子。
and that is a child who is missing.

554
00:57:14,047 --> 00:57:18,030
埃丝特的失踪改变了艾伦，
Esther's disappearance changed Allen,

555
00:57:18,087 --> 00:57:22,040
改变了他是谁，他应该是谁，
changed who he was, who he is supposed to be,

556
00:57:23,005 --> 00:57:28,006
但你就是答案。
but you are the answer.

557
00:57:32,088 --> 00:57:35,040
你和我有机会扭转局面
You and I have a chance to turn this mess

558
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:37,028
成为互惠的安排。
into a mutually beneficial arrangement.

559
00:57:38,015 --> 00:57:39,067
埃丝特在下面，不是吗？
Esther's down there, isn't she?

560
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:45,016
你他妈的别说她的名字。
Don't you fucking say her name.

561
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:47,046
可以
Okay.

562
00:57:47,086 --> 00:57:49,078
你骗进了我家。
You conned your way into my family.

563
00:57:50,034 --> 00:57:51,078
你选择了这个角色，
You chose this role,

564
00:57:52,043 --> 00:57:53,082
现在你他妈的要玩了。
and now you're gonna fucking play it.

565
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:05,087
所以，你现在可以成为以斯帖，
So, you can be Esther for now,

566
00:58:06,009 --> 00:58:08,061
过着一种任何人都会杀掉的生活，
and live a life that anyone would kill to have,

567
00:58:08,083 --> 00:58:10,040
或者你为此承担责任
or you take the fall for this

568
00:58:10,049 --> 00:58:12,084
带着手铐被运回爱沙尼亚。
and get shipped back to Estonia in handcuffs.

569
00:58:13,066 --> 00:58:14,075
你怎么说？
What do you say?

570
00:58:29,098 --> 00:58:32,059
对不起，我吓到你了。艾伦：对不起。我很抱歉。
I'm sorry I scared you.ALLEN: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

571
00:58:32,073 --> 00:58:34,021
我们不应该让你一个人呆着。
We should have never left you alone.

572
00:58:36,056 --> 00:58:38,078
怎么搞的？她从自行车上摔了下来。
What happened?She fell off her bike.

573
00:58:38,086 --> 00:58:40,021
我在路边发现了她。
I found her by the side of the road.

574
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:42,082
亲爱的，你骑自行车干什么？
Honey, what are you doing on a bike?

575
00:58:43,048 --> 00:58:44,066
过来，让我们暖和起来。
Come here, let's-- let's get warm.

576
00:58:44,074 --> 00:58:46,057
妈妈，我很抱歉，停下来。
Mom, I'm so sorry.Stop.

577
00:58:48,031 --> 00:58:51,079
卧槽？是 啊
What the fuck?Yeah.

578
00:58:52,035 --> 00:58:53,070
那么这意味着什么呢？
So what does this mean?

579
00:58:53,088 --> 00:58:55,084
这意味着她不是孩子。
Well, it means she's not a kid.

580
00:58:56,005 --> 00:58:59,058
她是个成熟的女人，我们不能低估她。
She is a grown woman and we cannot underestimate her.

581
00:58:59,071 --> 00:59:00,089
不，她不止于此，妈妈。
No, she's more than that, Mother.

582
00:59:01,006 --> 00:59:03,085
她是一个住在我们他妈的房子里的精神病患者。
She's a psychopath living in our fucking house.

583
00:59:06,033 --> 00:59:08,068
所以我们只能和这个人一起生活？
So we just have to live with this person?

584
00:59:08,085 --> 00:59:12,042
我没这么说。那么，我们能不能，你知道吗？
I didn't say that.So then, can we just, you know?

585
00:59:14,033 --> 00:59:15,077
让它看起来像一场意外。
Make it look like an accident.

586
00:59:16,073 --> 00:59:19,056
太早了。我们需要考虑这一点。
It's too soon. We need to think about this.

587
00:59:20,012 --> 00:59:21,047
所以她现在是我们的主人？
So she just owns us now?

588
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:24,017
不，不，她和我们一样有很多损失。
No, no, she has just as much to lose as we do.

589
00:59:24,065 --> 00:59:27,009
听着，我们俩都没想到会这样。
Look, neither of us were expecting this.

590
00:59:27,035 --> 00:59:29,031
所以，现在我们只是看着她，
So, for now we just keep an eye on her,

591
00:59:29,048 --> 00:59:31,031
时机成熟时，我们就结束它。
and when the time is right, we'll end it.

592
00:59:32,009 --> 00:59:34,096
这太疯狂了，即使对我们来说也是如此。
This is insane, even for us.

593
01:00:19,014 --> 01:00:21,001
好吧，看到了吗？会着火的。
Okay, see that? It's gonna fire.

594
01:00:21,014 --> 01:00:23,045
嗯。把它拉回来。就这样。
Uh-huh.Pull it back. Just like that.

595
01:00:23,071 --> 01:00:26,023
然后你得到弓，把它翻进去，滑动它。
And you get the bow, flip it in, slide it.

596
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:29,002
看到这个了吗？你在看吗？是 啊
See this? Are you watching?Yeah.

597
01:00:29,019 --> 01:00:30,032
是的，你呢--
Yeah, and you--

598
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:31,089
美好的
Nice!

599
01:00:32,002 --> 01:00:33,007
你看到了吗？艾伦：是的，是的。
You see that?ALLEN: Yeah, yeah.

600
01:00:33,015 --> 01:00:34,024
这就是我要说的。
That's what I'm talking about.

601
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:36,050
我们今天要和Segar博士会面。
Our meeting with Dr. Segar is today.

602
01:00:36,063 --> 01:00:38,007
如果你不说话，我们就不会有问题
A problem we wouldn't have if you hadn't talked

603
01:00:38,016 --> 01:00:39,042
给鹦鹉。
to the parrot.

604
01:00:39,051 --> 01:00:41,047
悉尼是一只金刚鹦鹉。
Sydney was a macaw.Oh.

605
01:00:42,025 --> 01:00:44,003
所有金刚鹦鹉，
All macaws are parrots,

606
01:00:44,064 --> 01:00:46,064
但不是所有他妈的鹦鹉都是金刚鹦鹉。
but not all fucking parrots are macaws.

607
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:50,099
我们该怎么办？
What are we gonna do about that?

608
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:56,000
哦，我们让她相信。在一起
Oh, we make her believe. Together.

609
01:00:57,048 --> 01:00:59,096
西格尔博士：我们的目标之一是帮助埃丝特适应环境
DR. SEGAR: One of our goals here is helping Esther acclimate

610
01:01:00,005 --> 01:01:01,092
回到家庭生活中。
back into life within the family unit.

611
01:01:02,048 --> 01:01:04,031
其中一部分是回忆你共同的历史。
Part of that is remembering your shared history.

612
01:01:04,084 --> 01:01:07,084
你们在一起的时光，你们以前一起做的有趣的事情。
Moments you had, the fun things you did together before.

613
01:01:08,019 --> 01:01:10,045
奥尔布赖特先生，什么是有意义的记忆
Mr. Albright, what's a memory that means a lot

614
01:01:10,054 --> 01:01:12,015
给你和埃丝特？
to you and to Esther?

615
01:01:12,023 --> 01:01:14,093
哦，天哪，太多了。
Oh, God, there are so many.

616
01:01:15,045 --> 01:01:18,089
巴黎有个圣诞节。
Um, there was Christmas in Paris.

617
01:01:19,011 --> 01:01:20,068
托斯卡纳的夏天。
The summer in Tuscany.

618
01:01:20,081 --> 01:01:22,073
黄石公园。艾伦：是的，就在上面。
Yellowstone.ALLEN: Yeah, that's up there.

619
01:01:23,011 --> 01:01:24,024
我六岁。
I was six.

620
01:01:25,042 --> 01:01:28,034
我们看到熊和一只花栗鼠偷走了我的三明治。
We saw bears and a-- a chipmunk stole my sandwich.

621
01:01:28,095 --> 01:01:31,026
哦，天哪。有那么多花栗鼠。
Oh, my God. There were so many chipmunks.

622
01:01:31,034 --> 01:01:33,082
还有什么，埃丝特？要具体。
What else, Esther? Be specific.

623
01:01:34,013 --> 01:01:36,079
我们住在麋鹿岭牧场，骑马。
We stayed at Elk Ridge Ranch and rode horses.

624
01:01:37,017 --> 01:01:38,078
我的是一匹名叫努吉特的小马
Mine was a pony named Nugget

625
01:01:38,087 --> 01:01:40,009
爸爸的马叫舒展，
and Daddy's horse was called Stretch,

626
01:01:40,074 --> 01:01:43,083
这一次，当斯泰奇俯身吃草时，
and this one time when Stretch leaned down to eat grass,

627
01:01:43,092 --> 01:01:46,053
爸爸一头栽在地上。
Daddy fell right over his head onto the ground.

628
01:01:47,001 --> 01:01:49,010
他满脸都是污垢。甚至在他的牙齿里！
He had dirt all over his face. It was even in his teeth!

629
01:01:49,018 --> 01:01:51,001
我不敢相信你在讲这个故事。
I can't believe you're telling this story.

630
01:01:51,014 --> 01:01:53,023
哦，天哪。它在你的牙齿里好几天了。
Oh, my God. It was in your teeth for days.

631
01:01:54,089 --> 01:01:58,002
总之，埃丝特展现了健康的人生观，
In summary, Esther exhibits a healthy outlook on life,

632
01:01:58,045 --> 01:02:00,054
尤其是重新进入这个家庭单元。
especially re-entering into this family unit.

633
01:02:01,033 --> 01:02:02,085
她功能很强，
She is highly functioning,

634
01:02:03,081 --> 01:02:04,094
情感上很好。
emotionally well.

635
01:02:06,051 --> 01:02:08,021
仅此而已。
That is all.

636
01:02:09,099 --> 01:02:11,095
今天有人过来
There are people coming over today

637
01:02:12,012 --> 01:02:13,034
只是想见你。
just to see you.

638
01:02:15,043 --> 01:02:18,009
他们是我们认识埃丝特的朋友。
They're friends of ours who knew Esther.

639
01:02:18,017 --> 01:02:21,004
别再怒目而视了，好吗？
So enough with the glowering, okay?

640
01:02:22,026 --> 01:02:24,048
埃丝特是一位女士。
Esther is a lady.

641
01:02:25,061 --> 01:02:27,026
隐马尔可夫模型。
Hmm.

642
01:02:28,088 --> 01:02:32,014
我想我得做点破坏。
I think I'm gonna have to do some damage.

643
01:02:35,071 --> 01:02:36,097
可以
Okay.

644
01:02:39,045 --> 01:02:40,071
我认为我们做得很好。
Think we did good.

645
01:02:41,006 --> 01:02:43,050
每个人都希望埃丝特破产。
Everyone expects Esther to be broken.

646
01:02:43,085 --> 01:02:46,033
他们真正想要的是一个幸福的结局。
What they really want is a happy ending.

647
01:02:47,007 --> 01:02:48,025
我们要假装
We are gonna pretend

648
01:02:48,072 --> 01:02:50,077
那粉红色是你最喜欢的颜色。
that pink is your favorite color.

649
01:02:51,025 --> 01:02:52,047
噢，天鹅绒。
Ooh, velvet.

650
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:57,020
秘密是给他们一个他们想相信的故事。
The secret is to give them a story they want to believe.

651
01:02:57,064 --> 01:03:00,051
这是我最喜欢的。
This one is my favorite.

652
01:03:00,073 --> 01:03:03,021
你最喜欢什么颜色？粉红色
What's your favorite color? Pink.

653
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:04,056
非常非常好。
Very, very good.

654
01:03:06,065 --> 01:03:11,039
现在，你说你会画画。你还能做什么？
Now, you say you can paint. What else can you do?

655
01:03:27,072 --> 01:03:29,064
我非常想念我的家人。
I missed my family very much.

656
01:03:29,072 --> 01:03:31,098
回来真是太好了。
It's lovely to be back.

657
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:34,038
你现在有什么计划，小姐？
And what are your plans now, young lady?

658
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:38,017
我的计划是什么，妈妈？
What are my plans, Mummy?

659
01:03:39,034 --> 01:03:40,073
绝对没有。
Absolutely nothing.

660
01:03:41,034 --> 01:03:43,060
我不会让你离开我的视线。
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

661
01:03:44,017 --> 01:03:46,061
哦。
Aw.

662
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,011
让我直说吧。。。
So let me get this straight...

663
01:04:11,006 --> 01:04:12,024
你30岁了？
you're 30?

664
01:04:12,067 --> 01:04:14,015
请离开我的房间。
Get out of my room now, please.

665
01:04:14,024 --> 01:04:16,085
这不是你的房间。这是我死去姐姐的房间。
It's not your room. It's my dead sister's room.

666
01:04:17,042 --> 01:04:19,003
你不是她，你永远也不会。
You're not her and you never will be.

667
01:04:19,033 --> 01:04:21,046
清楚吗？滚开。
Is that perfectly clear?Fuck off.

668
01:04:21,055 --> 01:04:23,007
小心你的嘴，怪物。
Watch your mouth, freak.

669
01:04:24,043 --> 01:04:26,017
我很高兴现在一切都公开了，
You know, I'm glad everything's out in the open now,

670
01:04:26,025 --> 01:04:28,021
因为我受够了假装你属于这里。
'cause I'm done pretending like you belong here.

671
01:04:28,056 --> 01:04:29,060
你没有。
You don't.

672
01:04:30,082 --> 01:04:35,000
这是我的房子，我的家人，永远不会是你的。
This is my house, my family, it'll never be yours.

673
01:04:35,096 --> 01:04:37,005
只要你在这个屋檐下，
As long as you're under this roof,

674
01:04:37,013 --> 01:04:38,061
你和我会有一个谅解。
you and I will have an understanding.

675
01:04:39,044 --> 01:04:40,035
这就是它。
Here's what it is.

676
01:04:43,023 --> 01:04:45,084
我他妈的拥有你。
I fucking own you.

677
01:04:48,028 --> 01:04:49,098
再这样做，我就杀了你，就像我杀了埃丝特一样。
Do that again and I'll kill you like I killed Esther.

678
01:04:54,046 --> 01:04:55,055
我打了一个电话，
One call from me,

679
01:04:55,063 --> 01:04:57,033
你又回到了古拉格。
and you're right back in that gulag.

680
01:04:57,076 --> 01:04:59,011
你也会下去的。
You'd go down, too.

681
01:04:59,046 --> 01:05:02,042
为什么，因为非法移民，逃犯，
Why, because of what the illegal immigrant, fugitive,

682
01:05:02,051 --> 01:05:03,090
精神病人说什么？
mental patient said?

683
01:05:05,051 --> 01:05:06,060
祝你好运。
Good luck with that.

684
01:05:09,064 --> 01:05:10,082
这是美国。
This is America.

685
01:05:11,095 --> 01:05:13,013
像我这样的人很重要，
People like me matter,

686
01:05:13,087 --> 01:05:15,000
如果你不是埃丝特，
and if you're not Esther,

687
01:05:15,009 --> 01:05:16,087
那只是意味着埃丝特又失踪了。
that just means Esther's missing again.

688
01:05:17,026 --> 01:05:18,083
妈妈对此有问题。
Mom has a problem with that.

689
01:05:20,018 --> 01:05:21,018
我不。
I don't.

690
01:05:22,009 --> 01:05:23,018
再见，怪胎。
See you later, freak.

691
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,093
你今晚会睡得像个该死的婴儿。
You are gonna sleep like a fucking baby tonight.

692
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:39,098
我用迷迭香和肉酱做了烤羊肉。
I made roast lamb with rosemary and tapenade.

693
01:05:40,046 --> 01:05:41,085
我知道埃丝特不喜欢，
And I know Esther doesn't like it,

694
01:05:41,094 --> 01:05:43,007
所以我做了你最喜欢的。
so I made your favorite.

695
01:05:43,016 --> 01:05:45,077
噢，就像过去一样。
Aw, just like the old days.

696
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:46,099
我真的很兴奋能去
I'm really excited about going

697
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:48,020
明天进城。
into the city tomorrow.

698
01:05:50,003 --> 01:05:51,095
我要向画廊展示我一直在做的。
I'm gonna show the gallery what I've been working on.

699
01:05:52,069 --> 01:05:54,026
听起来很棒。
That sounds wonderful.

700
01:05:54,091 --> 01:05:56,083
好吧，这都是你的功劳。
Well, it's all thanks to you.Oh.

701
01:05:56,095 --> 01:05:59,026
我重新发现了做我喜欢的事情的快乐。
I rediscovered the joy I once felt doing what I love.

702
01:05:59,035 --> 01:06:01,057
我觉得自己又像个孩子了。你想来吗？
I feel like a kid again. You want to come?

703
01:06:01,065 --> 01:06:02,069
我很乐意！
I would love to!

704
01:06:02,078 --> 01:06:05,017
哦，埃丝特和我已经有计划了。
Oh, Esther and I already have plans.

705
01:06:05,074 --> 01:06:08,013
哦有什么计划？
Oh.What plans?

706
01:06:09,044 --> 01:06:10,062
这是一个惊喜。
It's a surprise.

707
01:06:11,032 --> 01:06:14,019
好吧，下次吧。
Okay, well, another time then.

708
01:06:14,084 --> 01:06:16,028
爸爸，你又在画画真是太好了。
It's great that you're painting again, Dad.

709
01:06:16,036 --> 01:06:17,084
嗯，是的。
Well, yeah.

710
01:06:19,045 --> 01:06:20,067
可以原谅我吗？
May I be excused?

711
01:06:21,024 --> 01:06:22,037
哦，别忘了你的--
Oh, don't forget your--

712
01:06:23,037 --> 01:06:24,089
你可以在楼上吃。没关系。
You can eat upstairs. It's okay.

713
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:29,003
亲爱的，嘿，怎么了？
Honey, hey, what's wrong?

714
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:30,020
爸爸，她很好。
Dad, she's fine.

715
01:06:30,046 --> 01:06:32,025
给她点空间。她很好。
Just give her some space. She's fine.

716
01:06:32,034 --> 01:06:34,082
是的，她可能因为弹钢琴累了。
Yeah, she's probably tired from all that piano playing.

717
01:07:09,007 --> 01:07:10,072
我可以进来吗？嗯。
Can I come in?Mm-hmm.

718
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:13,064
你没事吧？下面发生了什么？
Are you okay? What happened down there?

719
01:07:14,077 --> 01:07:18,060
一、 我不太喜欢妈妈做的菜。
I, uh, I don't really like Mummy's cooking.

720
01:07:18,073 --> 01:07:22,034
你能保守秘密吗？
Well, can you keep a secret?

721
01:07:22,082 --> 01:07:25,043
我也不疯狂。
I'm not crazy about it either.

722
01:07:25,056 --> 01:07:28,022
听着晚上是我最喜欢画画的时间。
Well, listen, um, nighttime's my favorite time to paint.

723
01:07:28,031 --> 01:07:29,031
你想和我一起去吗？
You-- you want to come join me?

724
01:07:29,092 --> 01:07:32,062
是的，我很乐意。艾伦：我们楼下见。
Yes, I would love to.ALLEN: I'll see you downstairs.

725
01:08:08,013 --> 01:08:10,092
这是一个如此巨大的空间。我很高兴你喜欢它。
This is a such a great space.I'm glad you like it.

726
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:15,053
每个艺术家都需要一个空间来释放他们内心的怪癖。
Every artist needs a space to let their inner weirdo out.

727
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:18,048
我们可以看到美丽和激情
We get to see beauty and passion

728
01:08:19,031 --> 01:08:21,010
其他人甚至不知道去哪里看。
where others don't even know to look.

729
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:26,023
我真的很喜欢。
I really like that.

730
01:08:39,025 --> 01:08:40,064
油漆太多了。
So much paint.

731
01:08:40,073 --> 01:08:42,034
是的，我是个邋遢的画家。
Yeah, I'm a messy painter.

732
01:08:42,077 --> 01:08:44,003
这让你妈妈发疯。
Drives your mother crazy.

733
01:08:48,043 --> 01:08:50,039
我想我今晚已经完了。
I think I'm-- I think I'm done for the night.

734
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:52,031
把灯关掉就行了。
Just turn the lights off.

735
01:08:53,056 --> 01:08:54,074
祝你晚安。
Have a good night.

736
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,011
看起来你们俩玩得很开心。
Looks like you two had fun.

737
01:09:18,085 --> 01:09:22,016
他是对的，你很有天赋。
He's right, you are talented.

738
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:27,030
他很了不起，不是吗？
He is something, isn't he?

739
01:09:30,047 --> 01:09:33,091
你以为他会想要你，难道你完全是在妄想吗？
Are you so utterly delusional to think that he would want you?

740
01:09:35,065 --> 01:09:37,030
“令人惊讶的是，我不是你的女儿，
"Surprise, I'm not your daughter,

741
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:38,078
我是个变种骗子。“
I'm a mutant grifter."

742
01:09:40,026 --> 01:09:43,070
他会像我猜想的大多数男人一样被你排斥。
He would be as repulsed by you as I suspect most men are.

743
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:47,053
好吧，请原谅，
Well, if you'll excuse me,

744
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:51,037
我要上楼去操我丈夫。
I'm gonna go upstairs and fuck my husband.

745
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:59,010
自从你回来后，他真的是个新人。
He really is a new man since you came back.

746
01:09:59,072 --> 01:10:00,081
谢谢。
Thanks for that.

747
01:10:37,045 --> 01:10:38,045
嘿，你。
Hey, you.

748
01:11:18,001 --> 01:11:19,066
我想埃丝特对不来真的很失望
I think Esther's really bummed about not coming

749
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,098
和我一起去画廊。
to the gallery with me.

750
01:11:21,084 --> 01:11:23,063
听着，我喜欢你和埃丝特
Listen, I love that you and Esther

751
01:11:23,076 --> 01:11:25,046
有共同之处。我只是--
have painting in common. I just--

752
01:11:25,059 --> 01:11:27,038
我和她没有这样的关系。
I don't have anything like that with her.

753
01:11:27,085 --> 01:11:29,037
我希望能和她一起度过这一天
I was hoping that I could spend the day with her

754
01:11:29,046 --> 01:11:31,024
也许我们可以找点东西分享。
and maybe we could find something to share.

755
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:34,007
另外，集中注意力对你有好处，对吗？
Plus, it would be good for you to be focused, right?

756
01:11:34,016 --> 01:11:36,021
如果萨尔喜欢他看到的东西，
I mean, if Sal likes what he sees,

757
01:11:36,029 --> 01:11:39,055
然后也许你可以去看一场表演，然后回到那里。
then maybe you get a show and get back out there.

758
01:11:39,073 --> 01:11:42,039
是的，好的。我们没有受伤，是吗？
Yeah, okay. We're not hurting, are we?

759
01:11:42,065 --> 01:11:43,096
不，不，一点也不。
No, no. Not at all.

760
01:11:45,021 --> 01:11:46,095
你是一位伟大的画家。
You are a great painter.

761
01:11:47,096 --> 01:11:49,057
人们错过了看你的作品。
People miss seeing your work.

762
01:11:51,048 --> 01:11:52,057
非常感谢。
Thank you.

763
01:11:55,014 --> 01:11:56,032
那是培根吗？
Is that bacon?

764
01:11:59,032 --> 01:12:00,050
这是天堂。
It's heaven.

765
01:12:04,062 --> 01:12:06,045
早上好，爸爸。绉纱？
Good morning, Daddy. Crepe?

766
01:12:07,002 --> 01:12:09,050
是的，请。有什么你不能做的吗？
Yes, please. Is there anything you can't do?

767
01:12:09,085 --> 01:12:10,094
妈咪
Mummy?

768
01:12:11,024 --> 01:12:13,024
哦，不，谢谢。我要像往常一样--
Oh, no, thanks. I'm gonna make my usual--

769
01:12:13,033 --> 01:12:14,033
奶昔？
Smoothie?

770
01:12:17,016 --> 01:12:21,021
希腊酸奶、羽衣甘蓝、亚麻籽和柠檬汁。
Greek yogurt, kale, flax seeds, and lemon juice.

771
01:12:21,073 --> 01:12:23,004
就是你喜欢的方式。
Just the way you like it.

772
01:12:24,008 --> 01:12:25,013
试试看。
Try it.

773
01:12:25,047 --> 01:12:28,047
我真的没那么饿。
I'm not really that hungry.

774
01:12:28,087 --> 01:12:30,039
我会的。在这里
I'll-- I'll have it. Here.

775
01:12:30,048 --> 01:12:32,048
不，这是专为妈妈准备的。
No, this is special just for mummy.

776
01:12:32,083 --> 01:12:33,088
我为你做的。
I made it for you.

777
01:12:34,018 --> 01:12:36,044
哦，亲爱的，你真好，
Oh, sweetie, that's so nice of you,

778
01:12:37,005 --> 01:12:38,031
但我更喜欢自己做。
but I prefer to make my own.

779
01:12:38,044 --> 01:12:40,062
特里西亚，来吧，试试看。
Tricia, come on. Try it.

780
01:12:47,084 --> 01:12:48,089
好的
Good.

781
01:12:49,023 --> 01:12:51,023
嗯，很好吃。
Mm, delicious.

782
01:12:51,098 --> 01:12:52,098
非常感谢。
Thank you.

783
01:12:58,020 --> 01:12:59,064
特里西亚，你没事吧？我很好。
Tricia, you okay?I'm good.

784
01:12:59,072 --> 01:13:00,072
是 啊
Yeah?

785
01:13:15,052 --> 01:13:16,091
我知道你想和我一起去，
I know you wanted to come with me,

786
01:13:17,009 --> 01:13:19,005
但我认为这一天对你来说真的很好
but I think it'll be really good for you to spend the day

787
01:13:19,013 --> 01:13:21,005
和你妈妈在一起。不过我想给你看点东西。
with your mom. I wanted to show you something, though.

788
01:13:21,035 --> 01:13:22,040
在这里
Here.

789
01:13:25,079 --> 01:13:27,058
在中间的那个。
It's the one in the center.

790
01:13:30,097 --> 01:13:32,049
伍德利学院的院长是我的朋友。
Dean at Woodley is a friend of mine.

791
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,080
伍德利是全国最好的艺术学校。
Woodley is the best art school in the country.

792
01:13:35,015 --> 01:13:36,063
你真是太可怕了，埃丝特。我能给他们看看吗？
You're scary good, Esther. Can I show it to 'em?

793
01:13:37,059 --> 01:13:39,024
我会喜欢的。非常感谢。
I would love it. Thank you.

794
01:13:42,059 --> 01:13:44,029
你能把这个带到站台上吗？
Can you bring this up to the platform?

795
01:13:44,038 --> 01:13:46,082
我要给爸爸妈妈买些咖啡。
I'm just gonna get some coffees for Mom and Dad.

796
01:13:46,094 --> 01:13:48,016
嗯。
Mm-hmm.

797
01:13:48,034 --> 01:13:49,073
好吧，我们在上面见。
All right, I'll see you up there.

798
01:14:54,062 --> 01:14:56,075
耶稣基督！小心你要去哪里，孩子！
Jesus Christ! Watch where you're going, kid!

799
01:14:56,084 --> 01:14:58,067
她属于你吗？特里西亚：是的，她有。
Does she belong to you?TRICIA: Yes, she does.

800
01:14:59,054 --> 01:15:01,037
怎么搞的？哦，没什么。很好。
What happened?Oh, nothing. It's fine.

801
01:15:01,045 --> 01:15:03,037
埃丝特绊倒了。艾伦：对不起，这花了很长时间。
Esther tripped.ALLEN: Sorry, it took forever.

802
01:15:03,059 --> 01:15:05,055
不，不！把他们打死，好吗？是 啊
No, no! Knock 'em dead, okay?Yeah.

803
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:08,051
爸爸，带我一起去！

804
01:15:08,059 --> 01:15:10,016
噢，亲爱的，我希望如此。下一次

再见。
Ciao.

807
01:15:20,008 --> 01:15:21,013
别紧张，妈妈。
Easy, Mom.

808
01:15:21,021 --> 01:15:23,008
你以为你他妈能杀了我？
You think you can fucking kill me?

809
01:15:24,008 --> 01:15:25,017
拿着这个。
Take this.

810
01:15:26,052 --> 01:15:28,013
味道像他妈的垃圾。
Tastes like fucking garbage.

811

我们的安排结束了。你他妈的死了。

812
01:15:33,062 --> 01:15:34,062

我很抱歉。我开得太快了吗？
I'm sorry. Was I driving too fast?

830
01:17:26,073 --> 01:17:27,086
你一定是埃丝特。
You must be Esther.

831
01:17:34,061 --> 01:17:36,096
我需要去医院。
I need to go to the hospital.

832
01:17:37,026 --> 01:17:38,048
你很好。
You're fine.

833
01:17:38,065 --> 01:17:41,004
感觉我被他妈的捅了1000刀。
Feels like I'm being stabbed a 1,000 fucking times.

834
01:17:41,018 --> 01:17:43,057
利希警官。甘纳：噢，我的上帝。
Officer Leahy.GUNNAR: Oh, my God.

835
01:17:43,066 --> 01:17:45,057
你能安静两秒钟吗？
Can you just be quiet for, like, two seconds?

836
01:17:45,075 --> 01:17:47,049
什么莉希：我们找到埃丝特了。
What?LEAHY: We've located Esther.

837
01:17:47,066 --> 01:17:49,014
你做到了吗？莉希：我要带她回家。
You did?LEAHY: I'm bringing her home.

838
01:17:49,023 --> 01:17:50,028
哦
Oh.

839
01:17:50,071 --> 01:17:51,084
哦，我也通知了艾伦。
Oh, and I've informed Allen as well.

840
01:17:51,093 --> 01:17:54,011
好的，再见。性交！
Okay, bye. Fuck!

841
01:17:54,045 --> 01:17:56,080
你没事。你没事。

埃丝特回来后表现得很不稳定。
Esther's behavior has been so erratic since she got back.

846
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:19,070
老实说，这真的很难。
To be honest, it's been really hard.

847
01:18:20,043 --> 01:18:24,017
我的意思是，有不断的谎言和这些愤怒的爆发。
I mean, there's constant lying and these outbursts of anger.

848
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:26,074
有时她甚至开玩笑说自己受伤了
Sometimes she even jokes about hurting herself

849
01:18:26,083 --> 01:18:28,035
我觉得她不是在开玩笑。
and I don't think she's really joking.

850
01:18:29,031 --> 01:18:31,070
你让她接受治疗？对,对。
You have her in therapy?Yes, yes.

851
01:18:35,036 --> 01:18:36,058
看看谁回来了。
Look who's back.

852
01:18:47,024 --> 01:18:50,059
起床我们正在这样做。现在
Get up. We're doing this. Now.

853
01:18:50,081 --> 01:18:52,077
是时候了。
Well, it's about goddamn time.

854
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:21,089
性交。
Fuck.

855
01:19:23,019 --> 01:19:24,041
我和你无瓜葛了。
I am done with you.

856
01:19:25,028 --> 01:19:27,067
没有什么值得你呆在这房子里。
Nothing is worth having you in this house.

857
01:19:46,035 --> 01:19:49,053
你的自杀会让爸爸心碎，

858
01:19:50,031 --> 01:19:51,049
但他会克服的。

859
01:19:55,005 --> 01:19:58,018
啊。
Ugh.

860
01:20:12,098 --> 01:20:15,003
去死吧，你这个怪胎！
Just die, you freak!

861
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:26,035
她在哪里？
Where is she?

862
01:20:27,047 --> 01:20:30,000
我不是有意的。
I-- I-- I didn't mean to.

863
01:20:30,013 --> 01:20:31,048
哦，太棒了。
Oh, that's just brilliant.

864
01:20:33,005 --> 01:20:34,023
事情就这样发生了。
It just happened.

865
01:20:42,014 --> 01:20:44,036
特里西亚。嗨，亲爱的。
Tricia.Hi, honey.

866
01:20:44,045 --> 01:20:45,076
警察刚打电话给我。
The police just called me.

867
01:20:45,088 --> 01:20:48,097
哦，我知道。对不起。这是我的错。
Oh, I know. I'm-- I'm sorry. It was my fault.

868
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:50,063
埃丝特在商店闲逛，
Esther wandered off at the store,

869
01:20:50,076 --> 01:20:52,015
我只是，我惊慌失措，
and I just-- I panicked,

870
01:20:52,046 --> 01:20:53,064
但我打电话给莱希警官…妈妈。
but I called Officer Leahy...Mom.

871
01:20:53,072 --> 01:20:54,072
…他们找到了她。
...and they found her.

872
01:20:54,098 --> 01:20:56,016
哦，很好，妈妈。
Oh, good.Mom.

873
01:20:56,029 --> 01:20:57,094
我在火车上，什么？
Well, I'm on the train.What?

874
01:20:58,007 --> 01:20:59,042
她，等等。
She's--Hold on.

875
01:21:00,068 --> 01:21:02,016
我要回家了。
I'm-- I'm coming back home.

876
01:21:02,047 --> 01:21:04,086
我会。。。
I'll be...

877
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:07,074
下楼把它做完。
Go downstairs and finish it.

878
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:11,095
什么下楼把它做完。
What?Go downstairs and finish it.

879
01:21:12,004 --> 01:21:13,004
特里西亚，你还在吗？
Tricia, are you still there?

880
01:21:13,091 --> 01:21:15,030
特里西亚，一切都好吗？
Tricia, is everything okay?

881
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:18,027
特里西亚，我现在要回家了。
Tricia, I-- I'm coming home now.

882
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:19,040
什么艾伦：我要回家了。
What?ALLEN: I'm coming home.

883
01:21:19,048 --> 01:21:20,083
你和萨尔的会面怎么样？
What about your meeting with Sal?

884
01:21:20,096 --> 01:21:22,000
算了吧。
Forget about that.

885
01:21:22,018 --> 01:21:23,075
不，亲爱的。我发誓。一切都很好。
No, sweetie. I swear. Everything is fine.

886
01:21:23,088 --> 01:21:26,040
埃丝特来了一切都很好。
Esther is here, all is well.

887
01:21:26,049 --> 01:21:28,032
听着，我快到城里的火车站了。
Look, I'm almost at the station in town.

888
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:31,049
好吧，你能坐出租车回家吗？
Okay, well, can you please take a cab home?

889
01:21:31,058 --> 01:21:33,050
因为我真的忙得不可开交。
Because I really have my hands full here.

890
01:21:42,029 --> 01:21:44,055
噢，去他妈的。
Ow, fuck it.

891
01:21:53,069 --> 01:21:54,095
给你。
There you are.

892
01:22:24,037 --> 01:22:25,046
埃丝特。
Esther.

893
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:31,073
出来吧，埃丝特
Come on out, Esther

894
01:22:32,090 --> 01:22:34,099
或者你他妈的叫什么名字。
or whatever the fuck your name is.

895
01:22:40,083 --> 01:22:44,066
你知道，它不必是这样的。
You know, it doesn't have to be like this.

896
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:47,083
真的吗，贡纳？
Really, Gunnar?

897
01:22:53,066 --> 01:22:55,031
我相信我们能想出办法。
I'm sure we could figure something out.

898

你真的相信吗？

899
01:22:57,067 --> 01:22:59,063
真的
Honestly?

900
01:23:00,058 --> 01:23:01,062
不
No.

901
01:23:02,033 --> 01:23:03,033
我也是。
Me neither.

902
01:23:04,059 --> 01:23:05,063
倒霉。
Shit.

903
01:23:31,096 --> 01:23:33,001
甘纳？
Gunnar?

904
01:23:37,053 --> 01:23:38,053
不
No.

905
01:23:39,058 --> 01:23:40,058
不
No!

906
01:23:45,076 --> 01:23:48,081
你做了什么？你做了什么？
What have you done? What have you done?

907
01:25:34,074 --> 01:25:37,000
你拿走了一切。
You've taken everything.

908
01:25:38,005 --> 01:25:40,031
艾伦永远不会是你的，
Allen will never be yours,

909
01:25:40,096 --> 01:25:44,096
但我可以我向你保证他会知道你是谁。
but I can I promise you this, he will know who you are.

910
01:25:45,053 --> 01:25:49,001
操纵我们悲伤的畸形人，
The deformed freak who manipulated our grief,

911
01:25:49,071 --> 01:25:53,050
杀了我儿子，还想杀了我。

912
01:25:55,024 --> 01:25:58,003
直到我做了该做的事。
Until I did what had to be done.

913
01:27:00,087 --> 01:27:02,013
打电话给消防局！

914

920
01:27:41,091 --> 01:27:43,017
我坚持不了多久了。
I can't hold on much longer.

921
01:27:43,065 --> 01:27:44,078
我失去控制了！
I'm losing my grip!

922
01:27:45,052 --> 01:27:48,057
爸爸，救命！艾伦：亲爱的，等等，等等！

923
01:27:50,005 --> 01:27:51,009

924
01:27:52,001 --> 01:27:53,058
她不是埃丝特！她是个成熟的女人！
She is not Esther! She is a grown woman!

925
01:27:53,066 --> 01:27:54,071
她在撒谎！什么
She's lying!What?

926
01:27:54,088 --> 01:27:55,084
她骗了我们！妈妈在撒谎！
She tricked us!Mummy's lying!

927
01:27:56,031 --> 01:27:58,005
把手给我！不，爸爸！请帮帮我！
Give me your hand!No, Daddy! Please help me!

928
01:28:02,006 --> 01:28:03,076
特里西亚！
Tricia!

929
01:28:47,076 --> 01:28:52,003
卧槽？我这么做是为了你。对我们来说。
What the fuck?I did this for you. For us.

930
01:28:52,046 --> 01:28:55,025
所以我们可以在一起。艾伦，我爱你。
So we could be together. Allen, I love you.

931
01:28:56,007 --> 01:28:59,003
你他妈的是谁？你是个怪物！
Who the fuck are you? You're a monster!

932
01:28:59,012 --> 01:29:01,047

950
01:31:13,095 --> 01:31:15,082
她的家，她的家人。
Her home, her family.

951
01:31:16,038 --> 01:31:18,047
整个情况是如此悲惨。

952

我知道。
I know.

954
01:31:22,087 --> 01:31:24,061
好像埃丝特还没经历够似的。
As if Esther hasn't been through enough already.

955
01:31:25,087 --> 01:31:30,053
被绑架，现在成了孤儿，没有家人收留她？
Abducted and now an orphan with no family to take her in?

956
01:31:32,014 --> 01:31:33,062

957
