1
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:23,143
I'm Anna Troyev,
the art therapy instructor.

2
00:02:42,988 --> 00:02:44,816
Arms up.

3
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:54,957
I trust we won't go
through this every day.

4
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:57,393
Male voice: Anna?

5
00:02:59,048 --> 00:03:00,354
Welcome.

6
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:02,530
Are you ready for
your first day?

7
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:03,661
I think so.

8
00:03:03,705 --> 00:03:05,837
Please.

9
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:07,622
Do you live far?

10
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:10,407
Somewhat, but it's worth it.

11
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:13,212
I've always wanted to
use art to help people.

12
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:14,455
Wonderful.

13
00:03:14,498 --> 00:03:15,498
Please.

14
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:18,850
This way.

15
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:22,680
Those are our
security procedures.

16
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:24,943
Learn them backwards
and forwards.

17
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:29,252
Most of our patients are
quite docile, but others..

18
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:31,820
Doctor, it's Leena.

19
00:03:31,863 --> 00:03:34,257
She's not in her room,
nobody can find her.

20
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:37,782
Lock it.

21
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:40,785
Full on lock out!

22
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:52,623
Who is Leena?

23
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:55,017
Our most dangerous patient.

24
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,672
In fact, she's the reason
for the opening you're filling.

25
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:02,285
Your predecessor underestimated
her and ignored protocol.

26
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:03,895
It did not end well.

27
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:06,202
Listen to me.

28
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,986
Do not leave this room.

29
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,510
Don't worry, you'll be safe here

30
00:04:09,553 --> 00:04:11,468
and I'll come back after
we found her.

31
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:13,731
Please, please.

32
00:04:38,974 --> 00:04:40,323
Hello there.

33
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,766
Does your mom or dad work here?

34
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:57,514
Could I see?

35
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,570
Is that me?

36
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:13,922
That's very good.

37
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:17,012
I'm Anna.

38
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:18,361
What's your name?

39
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:28,458
Leena.

40
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:34,551
You didn't a-answer me before.

41
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:35,857
Do your parents work here?

42
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:38,860
Why would you think that?

43
00:05:42,211 --> 00:05:44,344
- Because you're..
- I'm what?

44
00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:51,960
Leena..

45
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,230
Put it down.

46
00:06:04,755 --> 00:06:08,585
Leena, put it down now.

47
00:06:24,558 --> 00:06:26,516
Anna: You didn't tell me
she was a child.

48
00:06:27,474 --> 00:06:29,650
Dr. Novotny: It's
because she's not.

49
00:06:29,693 --> 00:06:34,350
Leena suffers
from a gland disorder.

50
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,875
Which causes
proportional dwarfism,

51
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,749
essentially halting her
growth around age ten.

52
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:44,360
Make no mistake, Leena may
look like a child,

53
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,580
but she is a grown woman.

54
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:48,625
31 to be exact.

55
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,717
When Leena first arrived,
she struggled so hard against

56
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:59,331
her restraints that she
would bleed severely.

57
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:02,987
It was a lesson for all of
us on the depths of her

58
00:07:03,031 --> 00:07:04,641
will to be free.

59
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:10,604
Much of Leena's early life
was spent doing whatever she

60
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:12,910
could to survive.

61
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:17,132
But she never grew older, at
least not on the outside.

62
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:19,090
Imagine, going through
your whole life

63
00:07:19,134 --> 00:07:22,137
with the world only
seeing a child.

64
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:25,619
It is very important that you
do not see her in that way.

65
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:29,318
Leena uses her affliction as
much as she suffers from it.

66
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:33,844
She's an exceptional con artist.

67
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,328
Two years ago, Leena wormed
her way into this family

68
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:41,330
by posing as a runaway.

69
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:45,247
This family took her in, they
fed her, they clothed her.

70
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,902
Normally, Leena would simply
steal whatever she could and

71
00:07:47,945 --> 00:07:52,167
disappear, but this time she...

72
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:59,435
Well, let me put it this
way, she lives here now.

73
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:25,896
Idti.

74
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:40,041
Idti!

75
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:50,399
She does that.

76
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:16,207
Girl on TV: How much
longer we got, daddy?

77
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:18,253
Man on TV: You have a
few minutes, darling.

78
00:09:18,296 --> 00:09:20,603
You learning me by
heart little Sara?

79
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:23,606
Girl on TV: No, daddy, I
know you by heart.

80
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,217
You're inside my heart.

81
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,266
Man on TV: We're going to be
brave, aren't we?

82
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:32,309
Girl on TV: Yes, daddy.

83
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,660
Man on TV: But this is gonna
be our hardest battle.

84
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:41,668
Leena; Hello, Dmitri.

85
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:44,801
You're on time.

86
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:52,417
It's perfect.

87
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:06,693
I can't tie these myself.

88
00:10:27,017 --> 00:10:29,063
I want to do
something nice for you.

89
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:31,631
You can come in.

90
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:35,678
Yeah. Yeah.

91
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:19,156
Girl on TV: I can do it now.

92
00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:22,725
Any moment I may see, my
daddy coming back to me.

93
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:26,642
I don't.

94
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,339
My daddy has to go away.

95
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:40,384
Idti.

96
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:42,473
Do you want some candy?

97
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:13,417
Idti!

98
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:49,801
She cut the feed.

99
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,545
I'm so sorry, Anna.

100
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:58,506
Hopefully, the police will find
her before anyone else is hurt.

101
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:03,467
Not quite the start we'd
hoped for, I'm sure.

102
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:07,080
This job isn't for me.

103
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:25,452
Oh, Anna.

104
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:28,324
It usually takes only one.

105
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,580
Who's there?

106
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:52,000
Don't be afraid, I'm police.

107
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:54,601
Don't be afraid, I'm police.

108
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:00,515
Uh... Where are your parents?

109
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:03,316
My parents are in America.

110
00:19:05,492 --> 00:19:07,842
Sweetheart, what is your name?

111
00:19:10,845 --> 00:19:13,500
My name is Esther.

112
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:20,480
- You killed it.
- Thanks, man.

113
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:21,785
Proud of you, sweetheart.

114
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:23,134
Yeah, great job, pal.

115
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:24,135
Thanks, guys.

116
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:25,659
How long do you think you'll be?

117
00:20:25,702 --> 00:20:28,923
Actually a bunch of people are
getting together tonight.

118
00:20:28,966 --> 00:20:30,316
Well, congrats.

119
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:32,753
I'll see you guys
back at the house.

120
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:36,820
Allen: I mean, this was
supposed to be family night.

121
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:38,909
Tricia: What, is he not supposed
to have fun with friends?

122
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:40,761
Oh God, all he does is have fun.

123
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:42,284
No.

124
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:44,199
Gunnar works his tail off.

125
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:47,289
When he's not studying,
he's fencing.

126
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,377
He's living his life.

127
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:54,775
Don't do that,
don't go into your head.

128
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:56,777
I need you to be present.

129
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,039
Gunnar needs you.

130
00:20:58,082 --> 00:20:59,519
Oh, sorry, was I
not at that match?

131
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:01,956
Esther's not coming back, Allen.

132
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,175
I miss her too.

133
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:05,307
I do.

134
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:07,440
Every moment of every day.

135
00:21:12,053 --> 00:21:13,881
What's he doing here?

136
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:55,986
Woman: From the little we've
gotten from Esther,

137
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,404
we believe a woman
abducted her, brought her to

138
00:21:58,447 --> 00:22:01,015
Russia and passed her off as
her own child until Esther

139
00:22:01,058 --> 00:22:03,234
managed to escape.

140
00:22:04,018 --> 00:22:05,498
We haven't gotten
many specifics yet.

141
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,476
Perhaps when she's feeling
safer, she can shed some more

142
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,066
light on what
she's been through.

143
00:22:10,503 --> 00:22:13,506
We have a child therapist
that she'll be working with.

144
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:15,072
Good.

145
00:22:15,943 --> 00:22:17,623
But what she needs
right now is her family.

146
00:22:19,468 --> 00:22:21,165
Be prepared for changes.

147
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:25,605
Four years is a long time
in the development of a child.

148
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:48,367
Esther?

149
00:22:50,151 --> 00:22:55,678
Sweetheart, it's me, it's mommy.

150
00:23:03,773 --> 00:23:06,559
Can I, can I see you?

151
00:23:26,013 --> 00:23:27,754
Sweetie.

152
00:23:27,797 --> 00:23:29,146
It's mommy.

153
00:23:37,328 --> 00:23:39,461
I thought I'd
never see you again.

154
00:23:41,376 --> 00:23:43,552
Everything is right now.

155
00:23:47,382 --> 00:23:49,732
It's been so long since
you've seen any of us.

156
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:54,433
See if I can..
Oh, there's daddy.

157
00:23:55,129 --> 00:23:57,218
This was one of
our charity events.

158
00:23:57,261 --> 00:23:59,525
He looks so handsome that
night, didn't he?

159
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:00,676
Stewardess: Can I grab
you anything else?

160
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,441
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

161
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:06,401
Oh, speak of the devil, your
brother is probably a foot

162
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,099
taller than you'd remember.

163
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,146
Oh, there's Mup-Mup.

164
00:24:12,189 --> 00:24:13,626
She's been so good to us.

165
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:14,844
Oh, I can't wait to see her.

166
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,588
No, sweetie.

167
00:24:19,632 --> 00:24:21,198
She passed.

168
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:22,286
Remember?

169
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,375
It's just the four of us now.

170
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:28,031
I have to use the restroom.

171
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:35,474
Ah, is the restroom over there?

172
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:37,930
Stewardess: No, it's just
right back over there.

173
00:24:37,954 --> 00:24:38,781
Over in the back?

174
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:40,043
Hm-hm.

175
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:42,437
- Thank you for your help.
- You're welcome.

176
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:54,493
I can't wait to see you.

177
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:55,885
So stupid.

178
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,826
Oh, daddy and Gunnar are
just downstairs.

179
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,916
Do you think father
will recognize me?

180
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:31,617
Maybe not if you keep
calling him father.

181
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,574
Dad.

182
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:33,618
Yeah. That's better.

183
00:25:35,838 --> 00:25:38,101
Here, let me look at you.

184
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:45,413
Oh, my God, you look,
like a little lady.

185
00:25:45,456 --> 00:25:47,415
You've grown up so much.

186
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:51,941
Take this off.

187
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:54,422
That's better.
It's less austere.

188
00:25:55,902 --> 00:25:56,902
This is..

189
00:26:03,823 --> 00:26:05,041
Sorry.

190
00:26:05,085 --> 00:26:10,481
No, I-I'm sorry, I..
Come on, let's go.

191
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,940
I think, I'm nervous.

192
00:26:35,376 --> 00:26:36,986
Right, big step.

193
00:26:40,424 --> 00:26:41,817
Daddy.

194
00:26:43,123 --> 00:26:46,735
I'm so sorry, I can't
believe it's really you.

195
00:26:56,702 --> 00:26:57,833
I always knew.

196
00:26:58,573 --> 00:26:59,922
I always knew.

197
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:06,233
Hello, Gunnar.

198
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:08,670
Hey.

199
00:27:09,584 --> 00:27:11,127
I think we can do a little
better than "hey,"

200
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:12,151
don't you think?

201
00:27:13,327 --> 00:27:15,242
Come on.

202
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,944
Glad you're back.

203
00:27:21,988 --> 00:27:23,119
Me too.

204
00:27:25,252 --> 00:27:26,427
How about we go home?

205
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,082
- Yes!
- Let's go home.

206
00:28:12,473 --> 00:28:14,083
Tricia: Welcome home, Esther.

207
00:28:33,668 --> 00:28:36,236
We left it just as it was.

208
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:38,151
We always knew you'd
come back home.

209
00:28:40,457 --> 00:28:43,634
I mean you probably outgrown
so much but we have a lot of

210
00:28:43,678 --> 00:28:47,769
Christmases and birthdays to
make up for, so just let us

211
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:50,032
know what you're into,
and you might get it.

212
00:28:51,512 --> 00:28:53,122
I like painting.

213
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:54,602
You like to paint?

214
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:56,604
You were never interested
in painting before.

215
00:28:58,127 --> 00:29:00,062
Tricia: Well, maybe you two can
spend some time in your studio.

216
00:29:00,086 --> 00:29:01,609
Allen: Nothing would
make me happier.

217
00:29:12,315 --> 00:29:17,103
So um, the plan is, tomorrow
you're gonna talk to Dr. Segar.

218
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:18,408
Do you remember her?

219
00:29:18,452 --> 00:29:22,021
She, she had the
parrot named Sydney?

220
00:29:22,064 --> 00:29:24,327
Hm-hm.

221
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:27,026
Well, if you need anything..

222
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:28,264
We're be right down the hall.
Alright?

223
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,202
Receptionist:
Okay, you can go in.

224
00:30:13,246 --> 00:30:15,161
Dr. Segar will be
right with you.

225
00:30:15,204 --> 00:30:16,791
Dr, Segar: I'm seeing her
in few minutes.

226
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,967
I think it's too soon for you
to get involved, detective.

227
00:30:18,991 --> 00:30:21,167
I'd like to talk
to her alone first.

228
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,343
Look, I have to go.

229
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:40,232
Dr. Segar: You have no idea how
happy I am to see you, Esther.

230
00:30:41,056 --> 00:30:42,318
Welcome home.

231
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:46,888
Well now, you are certainly not
the little girl I once knew.

232
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:49,282
You're a young lady now.

233
00:30:51,632 --> 00:30:52,696
Do you remember what I told you

234
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,000
when we first began
our sessions?

235
00:30:56,463 --> 00:30:57,919
I told you if I ask any
questions that make you

236
00:30:57,943 --> 00:31:00,119
uncomfortable, we'll stop.

237
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:02,425
I wish my parents were like you.

238
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:05,037
How so?

239
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:07,319
Leena: They keep asking
what happened to me,

240
00:31:07,343 --> 00:31:10,477
but I'm not ready to
tell them about it.

241
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,044
Dr. Segar: And that's
perfectly fine.

242
00:31:12,087 --> 00:31:14,307
I am hoping you'll talk
to me about it,

243
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,570
but only when
you're ready, okay?

244
00:31:17,963 --> 00:31:20,400
Having said that, is there
anything you want to tell me

245
00:31:20,443 --> 00:31:23,751
about your time, away..

246
00:31:23,794 --> 00:31:25,535
You want to play, Sydney?

247
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:27,755
I think Sydney
wants to play with me.

248
00:31:28,147 --> 00:31:30,453
Hello. I remember you.

249
00:31:30,497 --> 00:31:33,108
Do you remember me?

250
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,632
Your turn.

251
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:36,914
Esther, you can wait out
here, I'm just gonna need to

252
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:38,505
talk to your mom for a moment.

253
00:31:55,739 --> 00:31:56,958
Hello.

254
00:31:57,002 --> 00:31:58,438
Woman: Hi.

255
00:31:58,481 --> 00:31:59,613
Leena: I like your earrings.

256
00:31:59,656 --> 00:32:01,832
Woman: Oh, thank you, honey.

257
00:32:01,876 --> 00:32:02,833
What are you writing?

258
00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:04,748
Oh! I'm sorry.

259
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:06,185
I'm so sorry.

260
00:32:06,228 --> 00:32:07,099
Woman: It's-it's okay.

261
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:08,404
I'm sorry.

262
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,102
Woman: I'm just gonna
get this cleaned up.

263
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:21,635
Dr. Segar: Does she seem the
same as you remember?

264
00:32:21,678 --> 00:32:23,376
Different?

265
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:27,032
Well, of course she's different.

266
00:32:27,075 --> 00:32:29,512
Dr. Segar: She has
an accent now.

267
00:32:29,556 --> 00:32:34,300
Is that unusual, considering
where she's been?

268
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:36,278
Dr. Segar: Not necessarily,
she was there a long time

269
00:32:36,302 --> 00:32:38,347
when her speech was still
developing.

270
00:32:38,391 --> 00:32:41,176
But I will tell you,
she's in far better shape

271
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,353
intellectually and emotionally
than I would expect.

272
00:32:44,397 --> 00:32:46,312
Tricia: That's good, right?

273
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:54,320
Dr. Segar: I did also notice
some inconsistencies.

274
00:32:54,363 --> 00:32:56,583
For example, she
said that was Sydney.

275
00:32:56,626 --> 00:33:00,108
Sydney was a macaw, bright
orange and four times the size.

276
00:33:00,152 --> 00:33:02,241
Yet, today, she addressed
this bird as Sydney

277
00:33:02,284 --> 00:33:04,025
with complete confidence.

278
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:05,548
What are you getting at?

279
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:07,309
Dr. Segar: To me, it felt
like a performance.

280
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,382
He hit me and ripped my dress!

281
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:15,036
I want to go home.

282
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:17,821
Tricia: That's enough for today.

283
00:33:17,865 --> 00:33:19,385
Dr. Segar: Of course,
we'll reschedule.

284
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,670
Tricia: Esther, you alright?

285
00:33:40,714 --> 00:33:42,063
Uh, yes.

286
00:33:53,161 --> 00:33:54,597
Hey!

287
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,991
Morticia.

288
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,297
Get Gunnar for me, would you?

289
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,646
What did you call me?

290
00:33:59,689 --> 00:34:02,083
Mike, that's her. The sister?

291
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:04,520
Oh, shit, it's my bad.

292
00:34:04,564 --> 00:34:07,132
Umm... Get Gunnar.

293
00:34:07,175 --> 00:34:08,524
Pajalsta?

294
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,113
How about I cut your balls off,
and feed them to you,

295
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:14,095
you fucking shit stain?

296
00:34:16,184 --> 00:34:18,056
Was that Spanish, or something?

297
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:19,057
I don't.. Hey.

298
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,406
Let's go.

299
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:22,123
Your sister's a
fucking trip, man.

300
00:34:22,147 --> 00:34:23,713
Seriously, dude, my
dad's right there.

301
00:34:23,757 --> 00:34:25,063
I don't care.

302
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:28,805
Mike, what the fuck..
I am what I am.

303
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,113
Hey, honey, you okay?

304
00:34:32,157 --> 00:34:34,028
Hm. My dress is ruined.

305
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,638
We'll buy you a new one.

306
00:34:35,682 --> 00:34:37,249
I was thinking, uh,
just thinking

307
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:38,641
we can go to the studio.

308
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:40,469
I would love to.

309
00:34:51,306 --> 00:34:52,525
If I didn't know any better,

310
00:34:52,568 --> 00:34:54,527
I'd think you've never
been in here before.

311
00:34:57,878 --> 00:34:59,575
So beautiful.

312
00:35:04,232 --> 00:35:05,352
Leena: What's the light for?

313
00:35:06,713 --> 00:35:08,062
What's the light for?

314
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:10,369
So you don't remember?

315
00:35:10,412 --> 00:35:11,852
This is what your
papa is famous for.

316
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:13,415
Hmm.

317
00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:15,504
Here.

318
00:35:15,548 --> 00:35:17,550
Press on this.

319
00:35:24,252 --> 00:35:26,950
Yeah, I always try to
fit so much in to one canvas,

320
00:35:26,994 --> 00:35:31,129
you know, So I resorted
to a hidden layer.

321
00:35:31,781 --> 00:35:33,107
Nothing is ever just
one thing, right?

322
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,002
So cool.

323
00:35:36,308 --> 00:35:38,875
You haven't been
in here in a while.

324
00:35:38,919 --> 00:35:40,790
No, I haven't.

325
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:46,056
What's this one?

326
00:35:50,931 --> 00:35:54,021
Oh, no.

327
00:35:54,587 --> 00:35:56,284
It's, uh, I should
have gotten rid of this.

328
00:35:56,893 --> 00:35:59,461
Who-who is, who is that?

329
00:36:00,114 --> 00:36:01,483
There's no use
dwelling on the past.

330
00:36:01,507 --> 00:36:04,205
You're home now, that's
all that matters, alright?

331
00:36:04,249 --> 00:36:06,947
So I was thinking we could
dust off some canvasses you

332
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,230
know, and see what comes of it.

333
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:09,906
I'd love to.

334
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,125
Yeah?

335
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:11,778
Uh, what's your poison?

336
00:36:11,821 --> 00:36:13,083
Oils, watercolors?

337
00:36:13,127 --> 00:36:14,346
I've got it all.

338
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:16,261
- Charcoal.
- Charcoal.

339
00:36:16,304 --> 00:36:19,133
Okay, pick an object and
we'll sit down

340
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,657
and we'll draw it together.

341
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,095
I want to draw you.

342
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:26,096
You want to draw me?

343
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,185
Hm-hm.

344
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:28,228
Allen: Yeah, okay.

345
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:33,191
Well, this is a first.

346
00:36:33,843 --> 00:36:34,975
How do you want me?

347
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:37,499
I can, I can do the thinker.

348
00:36:38,021 --> 00:36:39,861
The way you were when
you were looking at that.

349
00:36:41,721 --> 00:36:43,361
That's not a place I
want to live anymore.

350
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,205
There, just like that.

351
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:55,798
Allen: You learned to paint
while you were over there?

352
00:36:55,822 --> 00:36:58,694
Mm-hm.

353
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:05,092
Would you just draw, or was
it, was it also..

354
00:37:05,135 --> 00:37:08,269
It wasn't what you think.

355
00:37:08,704 --> 00:37:09,768
Tricia: It's still happening

356
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:11,794
despite everything
that's going on.

357
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:12,926
Allen?

358
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:14,406
No, he won't be there.

359
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:16,625
You know how he feels
about these things.

360
00:37:16,669 --> 00:37:18,299
So I'll see you at the
gala tomorrow then, okay?

361
00:37:18,323 --> 00:37:19,933
It's for good cause.

362
00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:23,284
Beth, just bring your
checkbook and Jim.

363
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,286
It's for pediatric
cancer, for Christ's sake.

364
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,246
Okay, that's better, thank you.

365
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:37,951
I'm finished.

366
00:37:37,994 --> 00:37:38,691
Allen; Already?

367
00:37:38,734 --> 00:37:40,432
Hm-hm.

368
00:37:45,654 --> 00:37:46,786
Do you like it?

369
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:47,874
Allen; I love it.

370
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:50,006
It's-it's incredible.

371
00:37:50,442 --> 00:37:52,400
Okay, thirty seconds, alright?

372
00:37:52,444 --> 00:37:54,489
And then we're gonna see
what you can do with paint.

373
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,138
Leena: That's private.

374
00:38:35,182 --> 00:38:36,531
Oh, I'm sorry.

375
00:38:36,575 --> 00:38:38,117
I-I saw that you brought it
back with you,

376
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:39,229
I thought it was special.

377
00:38:39,273 --> 00:38:40,273
You don't knock?

378
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,234
I was looking for my gold watch.

379
00:38:44,278 --> 00:38:47,150
It's OK, I'm sure it
will turn up.

380
00:38:47,194 --> 00:38:48,238
Sorry!

381
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,006
Property of Esther.

382
00:39:19,182 --> 00:39:20,445
Mummy took me to Wicked.

383
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:22,925
Mummy.

384
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:24,753
Hello, mummy.

385
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:26,364
Thank you, mummy.

386
00:39:28,888 --> 00:39:30,411
I know, mummy.

387
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:32,281
Mummy.

388
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:36,156
Huh! Mummy.

389
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,165
You're not gonna
believe what Esther can do.

390
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:48,124
We spent the afternoon
in the studio.

391
00:39:48,168 --> 00:39:50,257
She drew a portrait of me.

392
00:39:50,997 --> 00:39:53,303
She's got more talent than
I had when I was in my 20s.

393
00:39:53,347 --> 00:39:54,566
How's that possible?

394
00:39:54,609 --> 00:39:56,437
Four years ago she was
drawing stick figures.

395
00:39:56,481 --> 00:39:57,395
Easy.

396
00:39:57,438 --> 00:39:58,657
What?

397
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,243
Think about where you
were four years ago.

398
00:40:00,267 --> 00:40:01,573
Now you're a fencing champion.

399
00:40:01,616 --> 00:40:05,054
Yeah, just, it's impressive.

400
00:40:05,664 --> 00:40:07,448
Maybe you can make
a portrait of me.

401
00:40:08,101 --> 00:40:09,363
This is delicious, mummy.

402
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:13,193
Thank you.

403
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:15,935
Is something wrong?

404
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,154
No, no.

405
00:40:18,198 --> 00:40:18,981
I'm-I'm just..

406
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:23,029
Were you expecting someone?

407
00:40:28,948 --> 00:40:32,299
Male voice: Just thought I'd pop
in to say hi to Esther.

408
00:40:32,342 --> 00:40:33,909
Look who came for a visit.

409
00:40:33,953 --> 00:40:35,389
Oh, I'm sorry to
interrupt dinner.

410
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:38,324
Allen: This is, uh, the
police officer who helped us

411
00:40:38,348 --> 00:40:39,175
when you went missing.

412
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:40,612
He's a friend.

413
00:40:40,655 --> 00:40:44,093
Officer: I just came to say
welcome home Esther.

414
00:40:44,137 --> 00:40:45,791
Thank you.

415
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,143
Excuse me for a moment.

416
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:58,630
Allen: You should know, um, our
child psychologist feels

417
00:40:58,673 --> 00:41:01,589
Esther should tell her story
within the confines of a...

418
00:41:01,633 --> 00:41:02,993
Donnan: And not
with a cop like me.

419
00:41:03,025 --> 00:41:04,984
Don't worry, I get it.

420
00:41:05,027 --> 00:41:07,987
But Esther did vanish from
our little town,

421
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,903
and that remains a concern.

422
00:41:10,946 --> 00:41:12,948
I need to know if
there's still a danger.

423
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,430
I spoke to Dr.
Segar this morning.

424
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,694
Tricia: Is that appropriate?

425
00:41:19,738 --> 00:41:21,759
Donnan; She told me she's
open to a group discussion

426
00:41:21,783 --> 00:41:23,263
tomorrow morning.

427
00:41:23,306 --> 00:41:25,091
Just to see if
everything's alright.

428
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:29,008
Mummy, your gala is tomorrow.

429
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:33,162
Donnan: We'll do it the
following day then.

430
00:41:33,186 --> 00:41:34,317
It's important.

431
00:41:34,361 --> 00:41:35,536
I mean, sure.

432
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:38,191
If it's that important,
we'll be there.

433
00:41:39,932 --> 00:41:42,761
You forgot to fill your glass.

434
00:41:45,285 --> 00:41:49,202
Well, um, welcome home, Esther.

435
00:41:49,245 --> 00:41:50,377
You said that already.

436
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,247
Now, Esther.

437
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:52,988
Oh, it's okay, she's right.

438
00:41:53,032 --> 00:41:54,033
I'll walk you out.

439
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:28,458
I'm sorry you live here.

440
00:43:24,689 --> 00:43:27,648
You know.. I think
I'll stay here

441
00:43:27,692 --> 00:43:29,519
for a while.

442
00:44:00,376 --> 00:44:02,416
Tricia: I think something's
going on with Dr. Segar.

443
00:44:03,379 --> 00:44:04,705
She seemed to be implying
in our last meeting

444
00:44:04,729 --> 00:44:06,948
that Esther is lying.

445
00:44:08,297 --> 00:44:10,343
Allen: That's insane.

446
00:44:10,386 --> 00:44:12,040
Maybe she needs to
see a therapist.

447
00:44:12,084 --> 00:44:14,390
I know, right?

448
00:44:14,782 --> 00:44:17,742
What... what is this?

449
00:44:17,785 --> 00:44:18,786
Allen: Your date.

450
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:19,874
You're coming?

451
00:44:19,918 --> 00:44:20,982
Yeah, of course, I'm coming.

452
00:44:21,006 --> 00:44:22,224
You're my wife.

453
00:44:22,268 --> 00:44:24,270
I can deal with a few
rich pricks for you.

454
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,706
What about Esther?

455
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:26,576
Well, Gunnar's here.

456
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,404
She'll be fine. Right?

457
00:44:28,448 --> 00:44:29,468
What? Do you want
me to stay home?

458
00:44:29,492 --> 00:44:32,147
No. No.

459
00:44:35,107 --> 00:44:37,413
You know, it seems like
since we got Esther back,

460
00:44:37,457 --> 00:44:40,547
we got us back too.

461
00:44:41,766 --> 00:44:43,855
I couldn't agree more.

462
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,963
Allen: How long do you
need to get dressed?

463
00:44:45,987 --> 00:44:47,162
Tricia: I can be quick.

464
00:44:47,206 --> 00:44:48,381
Yeah?

465
00:44:50,426 --> 00:44:51,514
I can be quick too.

466
00:44:59,435 --> 00:45:00,567
I'm sorry.

467
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:01,610
No, they're cute.

468
00:45:30,989 --> 00:45:31,990
Just close the door.

469
00:45:37,691 --> 00:45:39,040
Just close the door.

470
00:45:39,084 --> 00:45:40,781
What?

471
00:45:40,825 --> 00:45:42,304
No.

472
00:45:42,348 --> 00:45:44,742
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

473
00:45:44,785 --> 00:45:46,047
Oh, my God.

474
00:45:46,091 --> 00:45:48,049
Do you know how much
I spent on this dress.

475
00:45:49,181 --> 00:45:49,877
Let me look.

476
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:50,965
Oh, man.

477
00:45:51,009 --> 00:45:53,489
I can fix that,
with a safety pin.

478
00:45:53,533 --> 00:45:54,621
Right, or staples.

479
00:45:54,664 --> 00:45:56,318
Staples will work.

480
00:46:01,454 --> 00:46:02,953
Allen: You're responsible for
looking after your sister

481
00:46:02,977 --> 00:46:04,718
while we're gone.

482
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,328
We're trusting you, okay.

483
00:46:06,372 --> 00:46:07,634
Gunnar: Yeah, dad. I got it.

484
00:46:09,505 --> 00:46:10,985
Allen: You look incredible.

485
00:46:11,943 --> 00:46:13,553
We're off.

486
00:46:13,596 --> 00:46:14,748
Tricia: Probably won't be home
till after midnight, okay.

487
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,339
So, don't let her
stay up too late.

488
00:46:17,383 --> 00:46:18,297
You have the keys?

489
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,473
Copy that.

490
00:46:27,132 --> 00:46:28,960
You look nice.

491
00:46:29,003 --> 00:46:30,526
Thanks.

492
00:46:31,614 --> 00:46:33,529
Have a good night, honey.

493
00:46:33,878 --> 00:46:34,443
Ciao.

494
00:46:34,487 --> 00:46:36,271
Night.

495
00:46:39,927 --> 00:46:42,103
So what are we going to do?

496
00:46:42,625 --> 00:46:43,626
We?

497
00:46:45,672 --> 00:46:47,065
Whoo!

498
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,654
Oh, it's out. Oh, shit,
guys, I'm sorry.

499
00:47:11,698 --> 00:47:13,656
I was holding on
to it for too long.

500
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,571
Okay, is it, Gunnar, is
your sister different

501
00:47:15,615 --> 00:47:17,095
than you remember?

502
00:47:17,138 --> 00:47:18,879
I mean.. What do you think?

503
00:47:18,923 --> 00:47:20,750
She's been at some
eastern European sex gulag.

504
00:47:22,404 --> 00:47:22,927
Mike!

505
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:24,015
Yeah, no.

506
00:47:24,058 --> 00:47:25,712
She, uh, she's
different, alright.

507
00:47:25,755 --> 00:47:28,323
She's got an accent now.

508
00:47:28,367 --> 00:47:29,890
And she dresses
like Lizzie Borden.

509
00:47:29,934 --> 00:47:32,414
It's so fucking weird.

510
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:33,807
Who is Lizzie Borden?

511
00:47:37,637 --> 00:47:41,162
Uh, some crazy chick who
killed her parents with an axe.

512
00:47:41,206 --> 00:47:43,904
Uh, hey, Esther.

513
00:47:43,948 --> 00:47:47,821
Why don't you go watch
a movie or something?

514
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,344
No.

515
00:47:49,692 --> 00:47:52,391
Esther, this isn't your scene.

516
00:47:52,434 --> 00:47:54,001
Go watch a movie.

517
00:47:54,045 --> 00:47:55,568
Go fuck yourself.

518
00:47:57,309 --> 00:47:58,629
Hey, Gunnar, you
know what I like.

519
00:48:02,357 --> 00:48:03,968
Go.

520
00:48:06,274 --> 00:48:07,449
Anyway, cheers.

521
00:48:08,711 --> 00:48:10,231
Male: Yeah, I'll fucking
drink to that.

522
00:48:14,717 --> 00:48:15,501
What were we talking about?

523
00:48:20,854 --> 00:48:22,464
Evening.

524
00:48:23,596 --> 00:48:25,815
Hey, my parents aren't here.

525
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:27,469
They're at mom's gala.

526
00:48:27,513 --> 00:48:28,993
Just my luck.

527
00:48:29,036 --> 00:48:31,125
Having a party?

528
00:48:31,169 --> 00:48:33,345
No, it's just a few friends.

529
00:48:33,823 --> 00:48:35,477
You can smell the
weed from the street.

530
00:48:35,521 --> 00:48:37,044
What?

531
00:48:37,088 --> 00:48:39,328
Uh, I don't know, I don't know
what you're talking about.

532
00:48:41,744 --> 00:48:43,877
Look, nothing's
going on here, okay?

533
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,706
So, um, why don't I just tell
my parents that you stopped by

534
00:48:46,749 --> 00:48:48,926
and we can just
forget all about this?

535
00:48:49,796 --> 00:48:51,798
Cool?

536
00:48:51,841 --> 00:48:52,886
Cool.

537
00:48:53,452 --> 00:48:55,323
Good.

538
00:48:55,889 --> 00:48:57,717
Mind if I hit the
restroom before I go?

539
00:48:59,545 --> 00:49:01,373
Yeah. Um, whatever, yeah, sure.

540
00:50:21,322 --> 00:50:22,802
Allen: That was a blast.

541
00:50:22,845 --> 00:50:24,606
No wonder those uptight
millionaires line up to give

542
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:26,501
the foundation money.

543
00:50:27,111 --> 00:50:29,417
Oh, no. It's the booze.

544
00:50:29,461 --> 00:50:30,853
It's not the booze, hon.

545
00:50:30,897 --> 00:50:32,420
It's the host.

546
00:50:32,464 --> 00:50:33,658
You bring the best
out of people.

547
00:50:33,682 --> 00:50:35,075
Aww!

548
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,226
I just hope the house
is still standing.

549
00:50:55,269 --> 00:50:59,317
I mean when I was
16, I-I nearly,

550
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,536
I nearly burned the house down.

551
00:51:01,971 --> 00:51:03,495
No, Gunnar would never do that.

552
00:51:03,538 --> 00:51:05,453
Who says I'm talking
about Gunnar?

553
00:51:10,154 --> 00:51:11,807
Esther? We're home.

554
00:51:14,506 --> 00:51:15,289
Esther?

555
00:52:11,563 --> 00:52:13,347
The Saarne Institute?

556
00:52:25,011 --> 00:52:27,492
Esther?

557
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:17,645
If you're not Esther,
who the hell are you?

558
00:54:34,706 --> 00:54:36,621
How did you know
that I'm not Esther?

559
00:54:42,366 --> 00:54:44,281
Her own mother
doesn't even know.

560
00:54:46,892 --> 00:54:48,285
Yeah, kid, she does.

561
00:54:58,469 --> 00:54:59,774
Damn it.

562
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:01,689
Mummy?

563
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,909
What the fuck are
you looking at?

564
00:55:07,782 --> 00:55:10,263
Tricia: So, let me
get this straight.

565
00:55:10,872 --> 00:55:12,831
You're a grown-ass woman
and a wanted criminal?

566
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:17,401
That is... beyond fucked up.

567
00:55:21,361 --> 00:55:24,016
This is all I ever do
anymore by the way.

568
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:25,757
Clean up after my kids.

569
00:55:26,148 --> 00:55:26,975
Don't worry about it.

570
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:28,455
Mommy will take care of it.

571
00:55:28,499 --> 00:55:30,327
Mommy takes care of everything.

572
00:55:31,502 --> 00:55:33,373
When Gunnar told me
Donnan came to the house,

573
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:35,070
I knew I'd find you here.

574
00:55:36,463 --> 00:55:39,248
You could've robbed us blind
and disappeared the second you

575
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:41,990
had a chance, but you didn't.

576
00:55:44,036 --> 00:55:45,385
Why is that?

577
00:55:46,473 --> 00:55:48,170
You're thinking bigger.

578
00:55:48,214 --> 00:55:49,911
Right?

579
00:55:49,955 --> 00:55:53,393
Play the part, manipulate us..
And a year from now we meet

580
00:55:53,437 --> 00:55:55,569
with some tragic accident.

581
00:55:55,613 --> 00:55:57,092
Am I getting warm?

582
00:55:57,571 --> 00:55:59,225
Let me go.

583
00:55:59,268 --> 00:56:01,096
You'll never see me again.

584
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,055
Tricia: That's exactly
what I'm afraid of.

585
00:56:03,098 --> 00:56:05,623
We can't have Esther
disappear twice now, can we?

586
00:56:06,928 --> 00:56:09,148
She didn't disappear.

587
00:56:09,191 --> 00:56:11,759
There was nothing that
I could do for her.

588
00:56:11,803 --> 00:56:13,282
It was too late.

589
00:56:14,893 --> 00:56:19,114
Gunnar.. He was always
way too rough with her.

590
00:56:19,158 --> 00:56:20,899
That night it just went too far.

591
00:56:21,508 --> 00:56:23,945
What was I supposed to do?

592
00:56:23,989 --> 00:56:27,949
Hand over the only child I had
left over some sibling bullshit

593
00:56:27,993 --> 00:56:29,560
that went too far?

594
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:33,259
I loved my daughter,
with all my heart.

595
00:56:33,302 --> 00:56:36,436
But a mother protects her
family, no matter what.

596
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:41,223
And if you think, that I'm
gonna let some psycho dwarf

597
00:56:41,267 --> 00:56:46,359
destroy what I have
built.. You're mistaken.

598
00:56:47,621 --> 00:56:48,946
This family came over on
the fucking Mayflower

599
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:50,102
and built this country.

600
00:56:50,624 --> 00:56:51,799
We matter.

601
00:56:51,843 --> 00:56:53,279
Allen matters.

602
00:56:54,106 --> 00:56:56,195
When he got the news
Esther was alive..

603
00:56:56,238 --> 00:56:58,458
The happiness on his face...

604
00:56:58,502 --> 00:57:01,026
I had to make this work.

605
00:57:01,853 --> 00:57:04,159
Allen doesn't know what
happened to Esther.

606
00:57:04,203 --> 00:57:07,511
And you are gonna help me
make sure that he never does.

607
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:11,297
There's only one thing worse
than the death of a child.

608
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:13,386
And that is a
child who is missing.

609
00:57:14,082 --> 00:57:17,129
Esther's disappearance
changed Allen.

610
00:57:17,869 --> 00:57:20,045
Changed who he was.

611
00:57:20,088 --> 00:57:21,699
Who he is supposed to be.

612
00:57:22,134 --> 00:57:26,660
But you are the answer.

613
00:57:32,144 --> 00:57:34,146
You and I have a chance
to turn this mess

614
00:57:34,189 --> 00:57:36,496
into a mutually
beneficial arrangement.

615
00:57:37,323 --> 00:57:38,563
Esther's down there, isn't she?

616
00:57:42,546 --> 00:57:44,765
Don't you fucking say her name.

617
00:57:46,027 --> 00:57:49,553
Okay. You conned your
way into my family.

618
00:57:49,596 --> 00:57:52,773
You chose this role, and now
you're gonna fucking play it.

619
00:58:01,695 --> 00:58:06,004
So you can be Esther for
now and live a life that anyone

620
00:58:06,047 --> 00:58:08,354
would kill to have.

621
00:58:08,397 --> 00:58:10,506
Or you take the fall for this
and get shipped back to Estonia

622
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:12,967
in handcuffs.

623
00:58:13,011 --> 00:58:14,491
What do you say?

624
00:58:29,157 --> 00:58:30,158
I'm sorry I scared you.

625
00:58:30,202 --> 00:58:31,202
I'm sorry.

626
00:58:31,246 --> 00:58:32,421
I'm sorry.

627
00:58:32,465 --> 00:58:34,162
We should've never
left you alone.

628
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:36,556
What happened?

629
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:37,862
She fell off her bike.

630
00:58:37,905 --> 00:58:39,603
I found her by the
side of the road.

631
00:58:39,646 --> 00:58:42,301
Honey, what were
you doing on a bike.

632
00:58:42,344 --> 00:58:44,085
Come, let's-let's go on.

633
00:58:44,129 --> 00:58:44,999
Mum, I'm so sorry.

634
00:58:45,043 --> 00:58:46,697
Stop.

635
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:49,395
What the fuck!

636
00:58:50,396 --> 00:58:51,571
Yeah.

637
00:58:51,615 --> 00:58:52,964
So what does this mean?

638
00:58:53,007 --> 00:58:55,227
Oh, it means.. She's not a kid.

639
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:58,839
She is a grown woman and we
cannot underestimate her.

640
00:58:58,883 --> 00:59:00,817
No, she's more than that,
mother, she's a psychopath

641
00:59:00,841 --> 00:59:02,582
living in our fucking house.

642
00:59:03,061 --> 00:59:05,150
Shh.

643
00:59:05,803 --> 00:59:07,544
So we just have to
live with this person?

644
00:59:07,587 --> 00:59:09,241
I didn't say that.

645
00:59:09,284 --> 00:59:15,073
So then can we just, you know,
make it look like an accident?

646
00:59:15,726 --> 00:59:17,118
It's too soon.

647
00:59:17,162 --> 00:59:18,946
We need to think about this.

648
00:59:19,381 --> 00:59:20,426
So she just owns us now?

649
00:59:20,469 --> 00:59:21,340
No, no.

650
00:59:21,383 --> 00:59:23,734
She has much to lose as we do.

651
00:59:23,777 --> 00:59:26,214
Look, neither of us
were expecting this.

652
00:59:26,258 --> 00:59:28,129
So for now, we just
keep an eye on her

653
00:59:28,173 --> 00:59:30,567
and when the time is right,
we'll end it.

654
00:59:31,176 --> 00:59:33,047
This is insane.

655
00:59:33,091 --> 00:59:34,614
Even for us.

656
01:00:18,179 --> 01:00:19,137
Cut.

657
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:19,790
See that, it's set in fire.

658
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:21,052
Huh-uh.

659
01:00:21,095 --> 01:00:22,662
Pull it back, just like that.

660
01:00:22,706 --> 01:00:26,318
You get the bow, whip
it in and slide it.

661
01:00:26,361 --> 01:00:28,320
- See this, are you watching?
- Yeah.

662
01:00:28,363 --> 01:00:30,888
Yeah, and you.. Nice.

663
01:00:30,931 --> 01:00:32,193
- You see that?
- Yeah, yeah.

664
01:00:32,237 --> 01:00:34,195
That's what I'm talking about.

665
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:35,869
Tricia: Our meeting with
Dr. Segar is today.

666
01:00:35,893 --> 01:00:38,504
A problem we wouldn't have if
you hadn't talked to the parrot.

667
01:00:38,547 --> 01:00:39,679
Sydney was a macaw.

668
01:00:39,723 --> 01:00:41,333
A what?

669
01:00:41,376 --> 01:00:42,813
All macaw's are parrots.

670
01:00:42,856 --> 01:00:45,380
But not all fucking
parrots are macaws.

671
01:00:48,775 --> 01:00:50,385
What are we gonna do about that?

672
01:00:52,257 --> 01:00:54,346
Oh, we make her believe.

673
01:00:54,389 --> 01:00:55,869
Together.

674
01:00:57,218 --> 01:00:59,109
One of our goals here is
helping Esther acclimate back

675
01:00:59,133 --> 01:01:01,309
into life within
the family unit.

676
01:01:01,353 --> 01:01:03,921
Part of that is remembering
your shared history.

677
01:01:03,964 --> 01:01:07,141
Moments you had, the fun
things you did together before.

678
01:01:07,185 --> 01:01:09,578
Mr. Al bright, what's a memory
that means a lot to you

679
01:01:09,622 --> 01:01:11,276
and to Esther?

680
01:01:11,319 --> 01:01:12,625
Oh, God, there are so many.

681
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,758
Huh?

682
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:18,544
Um, there was
Christmas in Paris.

683
01:01:18,587 --> 01:01:19,806
The summer in Tuscany.

684
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:20,764
Yellowstone?

685
01:01:20,807 --> 01:01:22,156
Yeah, that's up there.

686
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,202
I was six.

687
01:01:24,245 --> 01:01:28,119
We saw bears.. And a, a
chipmunk stole my sandwich.

688
01:01:28,162 --> 01:01:30,208
Oh, my God, there were
so many chipmunks.

689
01:01:30,251 --> 01:01:31,818
Mm-hmm, what else, Esther?

690
01:01:31,862 --> 01:01:33,341
Be specific.

691
01:01:33,385 --> 01:01:36,214
We stayed at Elk Ridge
Ranch and rode horses.

692
01:01:36,257 --> 01:01:37,974
Mine was a pony named Nugget
and daddy's horse

693
01:01:37,998 --> 01:01:40,000
was called Stretch.

694
01:01:40,044 --> 01:01:43,177
And this one time when Stretch
leaned down to eat grass,

695
01:01:43,221 --> 01:01:45,614
daddy fell right over his
head onto the ground.

696
01:01:45,658 --> 01:01:47,660
He had dirt all over his face.

697
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,706
It was even in his teeth!

698
01:01:49,749 --> 01:01:50,987
I can't believe you're
telling this story.

699
01:01:51,011 --> 01:01:52,665
Oh, my God, it was in
your teeth for days.

700
01:01:54,101 --> 01:01:56,756
In summary Esther exhibits
a healthy outlook on life.

701
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:00,325
Especially re-entering
into this family unit.

702
01:02:00,368 --> 01:02:02,153
She's highly functioning.

703
01:02:02,196 --> 01:02:04,764
Emotionally well.

704
01:02:04,808 --> 01:02:06,723
That is all.

705
01:02:09,203 --> 01:02:10,944
There are people
coming over today.

706
01:02:10,988 --> 01:02:13,599
Just to see you.

707
01:02:15,122 --> 01:02:18,778
They're friends of ours, who
knew Esther, so, enough with

708
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:21,520
the glowering, okay?

709
01:02:21,563 --> 01:02:24,392
Esther is a lady.

710
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:29,615
Hmm.

711
01:02:29,658 --> 01:02:31,258
I think I'm gonna
have to do some damage.

712
01:02:35,012 --> 01:02:37,536
Okay.

713
01:02:38,667 --> 01:02:40,234
I think we did good.

714
01:02:40,278 --> 01:02:42,802
Everyone expects
Esther to be broken.

715
01:02:42,846 --> 01:02:45,936
What they really want
is a happy ending.

716
01:02:45,979 --> 01:02:49,461
We are gonna pretend that
pink is your favorite color.

717
01:02:50,462 --> 01:02:52,246
Ooh, velvet.

718
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:53,813
The secret.

719
01:02:53,857 --> 01:02:56,598
Let's give them a story
they want to believe.

720
01:02:57,338 --> 01:02:59,906
This one is my favorite.

721
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:00,777
What's your favorite color?

722
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:02,343
Pink.

723
01:03:02,387 --> 01:03:04,041
Very, very good.

724
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:09,524
Now, you say you can paint.

725
01:03:09,568 --> 01:03:10,787
What else can you do?

726
01:03:27,064 --> 01:03:28,848
I missed my family very much.

727
01:03:28,892 --> 01:03:31,590
It's lovely to be back.

728
01:03:31,633 --> 01:03:34,593
And what are your
plans now, young lady?

729
01:03:35,637 --> 01:03:38,162
What are my plans, mummy?

730
01:03:38,205 --> 01:03:40,077
Absolutely nothing.

731
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,993
I'm not letting you
out of my sight.

732
01:04:07,104 --> 01:04:09,846
So let me get this straight.

733
01:04:09,889 --> 01:04:11,369
You're 30?

734
01:04:11,412 --> 01:04:13,197
Get out of my room, now, please.

735
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,459
It's not your room.

736
01:04:14,502 --> 01:04:16,026
It's my dead sister's room.

737
01:04:16,069 --> 01:04:17,897
You're not her and
you never will be.

738
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:19,377
Is that perfectly clear?

739
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:20,595
Fuck off.

740
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:22,684
Watch your mouth, freak.

741
01:04:22,728 --> 01:04:25,513
You know, I'm glad everything's
out in the open now.

742
01:04:25,557 --> 01:04:27,013
'Cause I'm done pretending
like you belong here.

743
01:04:27,037 --> 01:04:28,865
You don't.

744
01:04:29,953 --> 01:04:32,912
This is my house, my family.

745
01:04:32,956 --> 01:04:35,001
And it will never be yours.

746
01:04:35,045 --> 01:04:36,152
As long as you're
under this roof,

747
01:04:36,176 --> 01:04:38,178
you and I will have an
understanding.

748
01:04:38,222 --> 01:04:39,353
Here's what it is.

749
01:04:42,313 --> 01:04:44,793
I fucking own you.

750
01:04:47,405 --> 01:04:49,035
Do that again and I'll kill
you like I killed Esther.

751
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,718
One call from me, and you're
right back in that gulag.

752
01:04:56,762 --> 01:04:58,633
You'd go down too.

753
01:04:58,677 --> 01:05:01,245
Why, because of what the
illegal immigrant fugitive

754
01:05:01,288 --> 01:05:02,724
mental patient said?

755
01:05:04,465 --> 01:05:08,643
Good luck with that.

756
01:05:08,687 --> 01:05:10,167
This is America.

757
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:12,604
People like me matter.

758
01:05:12,647 --> 01:05:14,693
And if you're not Esther,
ah, it just means

759
01:05:14,736 --> 01:05:16,347
Esther's missing again.

760
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:18,175
Mom has a problem with that.

761
01:05:18,218 --> 01:05:20,960
I don't.

762
01:05:21,004 --> 01:05:22,701
See you later, freak.

763
01:05:29,664 --> 01:05:33,538
You are gonna sleep
like a fucking baby tonight.

764
01:05:35,627 --> 01:05:39,457
I made roast lamb
with rosemary and tapenade.

765
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,024
And I know, Esther
doesn't like it.

766
01:05:41,067 --> 01:05:42,460
So I made your favorite.

767
01:05:42,503 --> 01:05:44,984
Oh, just like the old days.

768
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:48,118
I'm really excited about
going into the city tomorrow.

769
01:05:48,161 --> 01:05:50,859
I'm gonna show the gallery
what I've been working on.

770
01:05:51,904 --> 01:05:53,993
That sounds wonderful.

771
01:05:54,037 --> 01:05:55,144
Well, it's all thanks to you.

772
01:05:55,168 --> 01:05:56,691
Oh.

773
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:58,365
I rediscovered the joy I once
felt doing what I loved.

774
01:05:58,389 --> 01:05:59,868
I feel like a kid again.

775
01:05:59,912 --> 01:06:00,695
Do you wanna come?

776
01:06:00,739 --> 01:06:01,783
I would love to!

777
01:06:01,827 --> 01:06:04,003
Oh, Esther and I
already have plans.

778
01:06:04,047 --> 01:06:06,179
Oh.

779
01:06:06,223 --> 01:06:08,529
What plans?

780
01:06:08,573 --> 01:06:10,227
It's a surprise.

781
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:11,184
Okay.

782
01:06:11,228 --> 01:06:13,970
Well, another time then.

783
01:06:14,013 --> 01:06:15,512
It's great that you're
painting again, dad.

784
01:06:15,536 --> 01:06:18,322
Well, yeah.

785
01:06:18,757 --> 01:06:20,411
May I be excused?

786
01:06:20,454 --> 01:06:24,676
Oh, don't forget your.. You
can eat upstairs, it's okay.

787
01:06:26,286 --> 01:06:28,201
Honey, hey, what's wrong?

788
01:06:28,245 --> 01:06:29,420
Dad, she's fine.

789
01:06:29,463 --> 01:06:30,551
Just give her some space.

790
01:06:30,595 --> 01:06:31,248
She's fine.

791
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:32,727
Yeah.

792
01:06:32,771 --> 01:06:34,691
She's probably tired from
all that piano playing.

793
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:09,155
Can I come in?

794
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:10,678
Mm-hmm.

795
01:07:10,722 --> 01:07:11,723
Are you okay?

796
01:07:11,766 --> 01:07:13,203
What happened down there?

797
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:18,295
I, uh, I don't really
like mummy's cooking.

798
01:07:20,471 --> 01:07:21,950
Can you keep a secret.

799
01:07:21,994 --> 01:07:23,604
I'm not crazy about it either.

800
01:07:23,648 --> 01:07:27,304
Oh, listen, um, night time's
my favorite time to paint.

801
01:07:27,347 --> 01:07:28,783
Do you, you wanna come join me?

802
01:07:28,827 --> 01:07:30,611
Yes, I would love to.

803
01:07:30,655 --> 01:07:32,265
I'll see you downstairs.

804
01:08:07,387 --> 01:08:08,954
This is a such a great space.

805
01:08:08,997 --> 01:08:10,956
I'm glad you like it.

806
01:08:10,999 --> 01:08:15,003
Every artist needs a space to
let their inner weirdo out.

807
01:08:15,917 --> 01:08:17,876
We get to see beauty, passion,

808
01:08:17,919 --> 01:08:20,226
where others don't
even know to look.

809
01:08:24,187 --> 01:08:25,492
I really like that.

810
01:08:39,027 --> 01:08:40,290
So much paint.

811
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:41,856
Yeah, I'm a messy painter.

812
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:43,554
Allen: Drives your mother crazy.

813
01:08:48,341 --> 01:08:50,213
I think I'm, I think
I'm done for the night.

814
01:08:50,256 --> 01:08:51,518
Just turn the lights off.

815
01:08:51,562 --> 01:08:54,260
Have a good night.

816
01:09:13,105 --> 01:09:14,802
Looks like you two had fun.

817
01:09:17,892 --> 01:09:18,937
He's right.

818
01:09:19,546 --> 01:09:20,939
You are talented.

819
01:09:24,595 --> 01:09:26,597
He is something, isn't he?

820
01:09:29,730 --> 01:09:31,645
Are you so utterly
delusional to think that

821
01:09:31,689 --> 01:09:33,212
he would want you?

822
01:09:34,822 --> 01:09:37,651
"Surprise, I'm not your
daughter, I'm a mutant grifter."

823
01:09:39,392 --> 01:09:41,177
He would be as repulsed
by you as I suspect

824
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:42,787
most men are.

825
01:09:44,267 --> 01:09:47,879
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go upstairs

826
01:09:47,922 --> 01:09:50,098
and fuck my husband.

827
01:09:55,756 --> 01:09:57,758
He really is a new
man since you came back.

828
01:09:58,933 --> 01:09:59,933
Thanks for that.

829
01:10:36,797 --> 01:10:39,060
Hey, you.

830
01:11:10,222 --> 01:11:11,876
Argh!

831
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,511
I think Esther's really
bummed about not coming to the

832
01:11:18,535 --> 01:11:20,798
gallery with me.

833
01:11:21,755 --> 01:11:23,820
Listen, I love that you and
Esther have painting in common.

834
01:11:23,844 --> 01:11:26,194
I just, I don't have
anything like that with her.

835
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:28,458
I was hoping that I could
spend the day with her

836
01:11:28,501 --> 01:11:30,634
and maybe we could find
something to share.

837
01:11:30,677 --> 01:11:33,332
Plus it would be good for
you to be focused, right?

838
01:11:33,376 --> 01:11:36,466
I mean if Sals likes what he
sees then, maybe you get a show

839
01:11:36,509 --> 01:11:38,511
and you get back out there.

840
01:11:38,555 --> 01:11:40,426
Yeah, okay.

841
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:41,490
We're not hurting, are we?

842
01:11:41,514 --> 01:11:42,167
No, no.

843
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:43,908
Not at all.

844
01:11:43,951 --> 01:11:46,954
I.. You are a great painter.

845
01:11:46,998 --> 01:11:48,158
People miss seeing your work.

846
01:11:50,654 --> 01:11:52,308
Thank you.

847
01:11:54,092 --> 01:11:55,702
Is that bacon?

848
01:11:58,096 --> 01:12:00,272
Oh, it's heaven!

849
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:05,146
Good morning, daddy.

850
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:06,060
Crepe?

851
01:12:06,104 --> 01:12:07,192
Yes, please.

852
01:12:07,235 --> 01:12:08,976
Allen: Is there anything
you can't do?

853
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:10,108
Mummy?

854
01:12:10,151 --> 01:12:11,152
Tricia: Oh, no, thanks.

855
01:12:11,196 --> 01:12:13,198
I'm gonna make my
usual... Smoothie?

856
01:12:16,419 --> 01:12:20,771
Leena: Greek yogurt, kale, flax
seeds and lemon juice.

857
01:12:20,814 --> 01:12:22,686
Just the way you like it.

858
01:12:23,251 --> 01:12:24,992
Try it.

859
01:12:25,036 --> 01:12:27,386
I'm-I'm not really that hungry.

860
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:28,822
I'll-I'll have it.

861
01:12:28,866 --> 01:12:29,954
Here.

862
01:12:29,997 --> 01:12:31,738
No, this is special,
just for mummy.

863
01:12:31,782 --> 01:12:33,349
I made it for you.

864
01:12:33,392 --> 01:12:35,960
Oh, sweetie, that's
so nice of you.

865
01:12:36,003 --> 01:12:37,527
But I prefer to make my own.

866
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:38,832
Allen: Tricia, come on.

867
01:12:38,876 --> 01:12:41,182
Try it.

868
01:12:46,971 --> 01:12:49,452
Good.

869
01:12:49,495 --> 01:12:51,062
Delicious

870
01:12:51,628 --> 01:12:52,628
Thank you.

871
01:12:57,198 --> 01:12:58,199
Tricia, you okay?

872
01:12:58,243 --> 01:12:58,896
I'm good.

873
01:12:58,939 --> 01:13:00,201
Allen: Yeah?

874
01:13:14,781 --> 01:13:16,368
Allen: I know you
wanted to come with me.

875
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:17,804
But I think it'll be really
good for you to spend the day

876
01:13:17,828 --> 01:13:19,090
with your mom.

877
01:13:19,133 --> 01:13:20,415
I wanted to show you
something, though.

878
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:21,439
Here.

879
01:13:24,965 --> 01:13:26,837
It's the one in the center.

880
01:13:30,144 --> 01:13:32,233
Dean at Woodley
is a friend of mine.

881
01:13:32,277 --> 01:13:34,322
Woodley is the best art
school in the country.

882
01:13:34,366 --> 01:13:35,193
You're scary good, Esther.

883
01:13:35,236 --> 01:13:36,542
Can I show it to them?

884
01:13:36,586 --> 01:13:37,456
I would love it.

885
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,762
Thank you.

886
01:13:41,982 --> 01:13:43,395
Can you bring this
up to the platform.

887
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:44,855
I'm just gonna get some coffee.

888
01:13:44,898 --> 01:13:46,465
Just for mom and dad.

889
01:13:46,509 --> 01:13:47,858
Mm-hmm.

890
01:13:47,901 --> 01:13:49,261
Allen: Okay. I'll see
you up there.

891
01:14:53,967 --> 01:14:55,839
Man: Watch where you're
going, kid!

892
01:14:55,882 --> 01:14:56,579
Does she belong to you?

893
01:14:56,622 --> 01:14:58,058
Tricia: Yes, she does.

894
01:14:58,624 --> 01:14:59,582
What happened?

895
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:00,365
Tricia: Oh, nothing.
It's fine.

896
01:15:00,408 --> 01:15:01,453
Esther tripped.

897
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:02,517
Allen: Sorry, it took forever.

898
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:03,542
No, no.

899
01:15:03,586 --> 01:15:05,065
Knock 'em dead, okay?

900
01:15:06,284 --> 01:15:07,764
Daddy, take me with you.

901
01:15:07,807 --> 01:15:08,504
Allen: Oh, honey, I wish.

902
01:15:08,547 --> 01:15:09,156
Next time.

903
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,288
Alright?

904
01:15:10,331 --> 01:15:11,245
Alright, you're gonna
miss your train.

905
01:15:11,289 --> 01:15:12,329
See you later, honey.
Ciao.

906
01:15:19,558 --> 01:15:20,559
Easy, mom.

907
01:15:20,603 --> 01:15:22,126
You think you can
fucking kill me?

908
01:15:23,257 --> 01:15:25,608
Take this.

909
01:15:25,651 --> 01:15:27,435
Tastes like fucking garbage.

910
01:15:27,784 --> 01:15:29,699
Our arrangement is over.

911
01:15:29,742 --> 01:15:30,742
You're fucking dead.

912
01:15:33,006 --> 01:15:34,138
Hey!

913
01:15:40,971 --> 01:15:42,842
Argh!

914
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,540
Mom!

915
01:15:45,628 --> 01:15:46,846
Mom!

916
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,109
Oh, fuck!

917
01:15:49,153 --> 01:15:50,241
Bitch!

918
01:15:59,772 --> 01:16:01,513
Open the goddamn door.

919
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,384
Esther!

920
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:05,386
Sweetie, come on.

921
01:16:05,865 --> 01:16:06,865
Don't you...

922
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:25,336
I'm sorry. Was I
driving too fast?

923
01:17:25,945 --> 01:17:27,686
You must be Esther.

924
01:17:34,911 --> 01:17:36,521
I need to go to the hospital.

925
01:17:36,564 --> 01:17:38,044
Tricia: You're fine.

926
01:17:38,088 --> 01:17:40,109
It feels like I'm being stabbed
a thousand fucking times.

927
01:17:40,133 --> 01:17:41,700
Tricia: Officer Leahy!

928
01:17:41,744 --> 01:17:43,180
Oh, my God!

929
01:17:43,223 --> 01:17:44,505
Can you just be quiet
for like two seconds.

930
01:17:44,529 --> 01:17:45,835
What?

931
01:17:45,878 --> 01:17:46,618
We've located, Esther.

932
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:47,401
You did!

933
01:17:47,445 --> 01:17:48,098
I'm bringing her home.

934
01:17:48,141 --> 01:17:49,316
Oh.

935
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,729
Oh, and I've informed
Allen as well.

936
01:17:50,753 --> 01:17:52,493
Okay, bye.

937
01:17:52,537 --> 01:17:53,669
Fuck!

938
01:17:54,191 --> 01:17:55,191
You're okay.

939
01:17:55,453 --> 01:17:56,453
You're okay.

940
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:58,586
Tricia: Thank you so much.

941
01:18:01,415 --> 01:18:02,678
Oh, my goodness.

942
01:18:03,069 --> 01:18:05,289
Oh.

943
01:18:09,249 --> 01:18:10,686
Thank you so much.

944
01:18:12,296 --> 01:18:15,386
Esther's behavior has been so
erratic since she got back.

945
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:19,085
To be honest, it's
been really hard.

946
01:18:19,129 --> 01:18:20,696
I mean there's constant lying

947
01:18:20,739 --> 01:18:22,698
and these outbursts of
anger and...

948
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:25,807
Sometimes she even jokes
about hurting herself

949
01:18:25,831 --> 01:18:28,268
and I don't think she's
really joking.

950
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:29,356
You have her in therapy?

951
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,010
Tricia: Yes, yes.

952
01:18:34,622 --> 01:18:35,667
Gunnar: Look who's back.

953
01:18:46,286 --> 01:18:47,461
Get up.

954
01:18:48,201 --> 01:18:49,986
We're doing this... now.

955
01:18:50,029 --> 01:18:52,162
Well, it's about goddamn time.

956
01:19:20,059 --> 01:19:21,582
Fuck.

957
01:19:22,322 --> 01:19:24,237
I am done with you.

958
01:19:24,281 --> 01:19:26,152
Nothing is worth having
you in this house.

959
01:19:45,824 --> 01:19:49,480
Tricia: Your suicide is gonna
break daddy's heart.

960
01:19:49,523 --> 01:19:50,523
But he'll get over it.

961
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:54,789
Uck!

962
01:19:55,878 --> 01:19:57,270
Ah! Aaagh!

963
01:20:12,024 --> 01:20:13,721
Gunnar: Just die, you freak!

964
01:20:24,428 --> 01:20:26,299
Tricia: Where is she?

965
01:20:27,866 --> 01:20:29,476
I, uh, I, uh, I didn't mean to.

966
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:30,434
Tricia: Oh, that's just
brilliant.

967
01:20:30,477 --> 01:20:33,089
It just happened.

968
01:20:41,227 --> 01:20:42,489
Allen: Tricia.

969
01:20:42,533 --> 01:20:43,621
Hi, honey.

970
01:20:43,664 --> 01:20:44,728
Allen: The police
just called me.

971
01:20:44,752 --> 01:20:45,710
Oh, I know.

972
01:20:45,753 --> 01:20:47,146
I'm, I'm sorry.

973
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:48,756
It was my fault.

974
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:51,585
Esther wandered off at the
store and I-I just, I panicked.

975
01:20:51,629 --> 01:20:53,631
But I called Officer Leahy
and, and they found her.

976
01:20:53,674 --> 01:20:54,980
- Oh, good.
- Mom.

977
01:20:55,024 --> 01:20:56,373
What?

978
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:57,809
Allen: Well, I'm-I'm on
the train..

979
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:00,551
Hold on.

980
01:21:00,594 --> 01:21:02,770
Allen: I'm-I'm coming back home.
I'll be...

981
01:21:04,555 --> 01:21:06,774
Go downstairs and finish it.

982
01:21:06,818 --> 01:21:08,820
What?

983
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,127
Go downstairs and finish it.

984
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:13,129
Allen: Tricia, are
you still there?

985
01:21:13,172 --> 01:21:15,609
Tricia, is everything okay?

986
01:21:15,653 --> 01:21:17,133
Tricia, I-I'm coming home now.

987
01:21:17,176 --> 01:21:18,003
What?

988
01:21:18,047 --> 01:21:19,135
Allen: I'm coming home.

989
01:21:19,178 --> 01:21:20,005
Uh, what about your
meeting with Sal?

990
01:21:20,049 --> 01:21:21,224
Allen: Forget about that.

991
01:21:21,267 --> 01:21:22,679
No, sweetie, I swear
everything is fine.

992
01:21:22,703 --> 01:21:23,574
Esther is here.

993
01:21:23,617 --> 01:21:25,402
All is well.

994
01:21:25,445 --> 01:21:27,447
Allen: But I'm almost at
the station now.

995
01:21:27,491 --> 01:21:28,535
Okay.

996
01:21:28,579 --> 01:21:30,363
Well, can you please
take a cab home?

997
01:21:30,407 --> 01:21:33,105
Because I really have
my hands full here.

998
01:21:34,802 --> 01:21:41,592
Yeah.

999
01:21:41,635 --> 01:21:42,941
No.

1000
01:21:42,985 --> 01:21:44,377
Fuck it.

1001
01:21:52,777 --> 01:21:54,431
There you are.

1002
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:24,852
Esther.

1003
01:22:28,856 --> 01:22:31,642
Come on out, Esther.

1004
01:22:32,425 --> 01:22:33,949
Or whatever the
fuck your name is.

1005
01:22:39,998 --> 01:22:44,394
You know.. It doesn't
have to be like this.

1006
01:22:45,917 --> 01:22:47,832
Leena: Really, Gunnar?

1007
01:22:53,011 --> 01:22:55,057
Gunnar: I'm sure we could
figure something out.

1008
01:22:55,448 --> 01:22:57,885
You really believe that?

1009
01:22:57,929 --> 01:23:01,324
Gunnar: Honestly, no.

1010
01:23:01,367 --> 01:23:02,890
Me neither.

1011
01:23:03,804 --> 01:23:04,804
Shit.

1012
01:23:31,093 --> 01:23:33,182
Gunnar?

1013
01:23:36,663 --> 01:23:37,663
No.

1014
01:23:38,578 --> 01:23:39,840
No.

1015
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:46,586
What, what have you done?

1016
01:23:46,934 --> 01:23:48,066
What have you done?

1017
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:35,869
You've taken everything.

1018
01:25:37,219 --> 01:25:39,177
Allen will never be yours.

1019
01:25:40,526 --> 01:25:44,530
But I can promise you this,
he'll know who you are.

1020
01:25:44,574 --> 01:25:48,273
The deformed freak who
manipulated our grief,

1021
01:25:48,317 --> 01:25:53,931
murdered my son and
tried to kill me.

1022
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:57,239
Until I did what had to be done.

1023
01:26:59,910 --> 01:27:01,190
Allen: Call the fire department.

1024
01:27:06,699 --> 01:27:07,699
Gunnar!

1025
01:27:09,311 --> 01:27:10,573
Gunnar!

1026
01:27:14,707 --> 01:27:16,535
Aaagh!

1027
01:27:18,494 --> 01:27:19,494
Do it!

1028
01:27:28,025 --> 01:27:29,331
Allen: Hold on, I'm coming.

1029
01:27:32,812 --> 01:27:34,727
Leena: Daddy, mommy
tried to hurt me!

1030
01:27:34,771 --> 01:27:36,294
Tricia: Allen!

1031
01:27:36,338 --> 01:27:38,253
Please help!

1032
01:27:38,644 --> 01:27:39,776
Allen!

1033
01:27:39,819 --> 01:27:41,038
Allen: Don't let go.

1034
01:27:41,081 --> 01:27:42,605
Tricia: I can't hold
on much longer.

1035
01:27:42,648 --> 01:27:44,171
I'm losing my grip.

1036
01:27:44,650 --> 01:27:48,567
- Da-daddy, help!
- Hang on.

1037
01:27:49,351 --> 01:27:50,613
Allen: I'm coming.

1038
01:27:51,135 --> 01:27:52,049
Tricia: She's not Esther!

1039
01:27:52,092 --> 01:27:53,006
She's a grown woman!

1040
01:27:53,050 --> 01:27:54,051
- She's lying!
- What?

1041
01:27:54,094 --> 01:27:55,748
- She tricked us!
- Mommy is lying!

1042
01:27:55,792 --> 01:27:57,712
- Give me your hand.
- No, daddy, please help me.

1043
01:28:01,319 --> 01:28:03,147
Tricia!

1044
01:28:46,843 --> 01:28:48,540
What the fuck?

1045
01:28:48,584 --> 01:28:50,194
I did this for you.

1046
01:28:50,237 --> 01:28:51,413
For us.

1047
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:52,979
So we could be together.

1048
01:28:53,023 --> 01:28:55,025
Allen, I love you.

1049
01:28:55,417 --> 01:28:56,853
Who the fuck are you?

1050
01:28:56,896 --> 01:28:58,245
You're a monster!

1051
01:28:59,943 --> 01:29:02,075
Allen!

1052
01:31:10,726 --> 01:31:12,858
Dr. Segar: The fire took
everything from Esther.

1053
01:31:12,902 --> 01:31:15,121
Her home, her family.

1054
01:31:15,165 --> 01:31:17,776
The whole situation
is so tragic.

1055
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:20,213
It's horrifying.

1056
01:31:20,257 --> 01:31:21,998
Officer Leahy: I know.

1057
01:31:22,041 --> 01:31:24,827
As if Esther hasn't been
through enough already.

1058
01:31:24,870 --> 01:31:27,656
Abducted, and now an orphan.

1059
01:31:28,526 --> 01:31:31,094
With no family to take her in?

1060
01:31:31,137 --> 01:31:32,878
What will happen now?

1061
01:31:34,576 --> 01:31:38,536
Dr. Segar: I've reached out to
a reputable adoption agency.

1062
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:42,148
I'm confident we'll find a
home where Esther can get the

1063
01:31:42,192 --> 01:31:45,587
support and love she deserves.

1064
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:49,982
After all who wouldn't
want to adopt her?
