1
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,860
The city is shocked by the missing babies

2
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:11,567
Within 3 months,
18 babies had been stolen

3
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,506
No findings have been reported

4
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,975
by the police

5
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,582
The Commissioner of Police...

6
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,678
There we are! Stop!

7
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:23,618
I'm coming!

8
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,147
Something wrong!

9
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,154
Damn!

10
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,656
Forget it

11
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,721
Be careful

12
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,895
Let's go to

13
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,468
the wonderland

14
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,769
This way please

15
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,668
it's a handsome

16
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:50,713
and quiet house

17
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,184
Only 5 minutes' ride to market

18
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,081
So many merits?

19
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,382
Of course, there're some defects

20
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,114
But not that bad

21
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,452
Follow me

22
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,022
it's perfect except that...

23
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,824
There's not been much renovation!

24
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,595
You call that renovation?

25
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:13,897
But the structure is OK

26
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,337
it's just a little fire

27
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:19,336
Darling

28
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,747
Let me show you something

29
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,012
Nature!

30
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,028
You move in and will love it more

31
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,398
What do you think?

32
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,725
Damn!

33
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,130
I did ask to have it renovated first

34
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,963
Wasting my time!

35
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,437
I'm lucky!

36
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,272
Jesus,

37
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,708
even a jerk won't buy this!

38
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:56,403
Let's go...

39
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,913
Stay!

40
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:01,478
Darling. Buy this house I like it

41
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:02,712
It has character

42
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,217
Character?

43
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:05,814
Really?

44
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,583
You know what kind of house I like

45
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,691
I know

46
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,295
So, pay a deposit first

47
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,487
Quiet

48
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,918
Stealing my car? You go ahead

49
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,579
OK... we go ahead

50
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,016
Incredible!

51
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,650
Of course, my hubby is a cop

52
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,459
Keep going!

53
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:48,531
I do

54
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,133
18 babies have been missing

55
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:53,032
these 2 months

56
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,733
It looks like the work of one person

57
00:04:56,929 --> 00:05:00,206
So far, no missing baby's family

58
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,902
they has received any blackmail letter

59
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,538
Nor has any group

60
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:05,545
claimed responsibility

61
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,615
Commander, this is bizarre

62
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,719
Shall we approach Wonder Woman?

63
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:14,322
Though she helped us before,

64
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,960
we still don't know who she is

65
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,460
We can't reach her after all!

66
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,963
All missing babies are boys

67
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:26,001
This shows it's not blackmail

68
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,036
Hey...

69
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,174
Maybe it has to do with evil religions

70
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,286
Is anyone rushing out?

71
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:53,260
No

72
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:55,960
Commander

73
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,266
"Your son will be next."

74
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,085
Come with me

75
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:27,164
Babies' ward is upstairs.
Operation Room over there

76
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,934
I'm worried about our son

77
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,070
Let's take him home now?

78
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,293
Lau!

79
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,198
If we bring away this new born baby now

80
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,501
The doctor wouldn't be responsible
after discharge

81
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:38,208
Lau...

82
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:39,605
Alright! Leave him here

83
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,437
Why not call Wonder Woman for help?

84
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,080
Sorry we got no way to contact her

85
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,273
I've sent more men here

86
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:48,008
Things can

87
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,244
go wrong anywhere

88
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:53,418
Please take care of my wife!

89
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:54,751
Yes, Commander

90
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,516
Come,
there was a traffic accident just now

91
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,389
Warden said those beds might be needed

92
00:06:58,551 --> 00:06:59,791
He asked us to think about it

93
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,159
You go out first

94
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:10,005
Lau, it's my son they're after

95
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:13,002
What about...

96
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,438
Swopping?

97
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,908
Whose son?

98
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,510
That's too immoral...

99
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,081
it's your son they want

100
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,980
Anyway, they will find him out

101
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:26,386
Yes, if others know, it'd be embarrassing!

102
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,554
Let's brace up

103
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:32,628
Brace up...

104
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,558
Sorry

105
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,790
Officer Lau said no entry

106
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,195
without permission

107
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:38,357
Forget it!

108
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,510
What's wrong?

109
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,239
Babies are falling down!

110
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,082
Catch them!

111
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,614
My son!

112
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,152
Take my son!

113
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,913
Which is our son?

114
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:33,555
Either can be!

115
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,454
Which?

116
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,744
Wonder Woman!

117
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,984
Wonder Woman!

118
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,644
She's coming down

119
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,924
it's blood is left on the wall

120
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:28,737
Not ours!

121
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:32,102
It's a baby girl!

122
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:35,542
It's my daughter!

123
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:39,442
I'm scared to death...

124
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:41,808
Get somebody to collect blood sample

125
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,818
Yes, Officer Lau! Come with me

126
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,125
Tung, one more baby is missing

127
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,027
I'll be back late tonight

128
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,258
Alright

129
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,832
Are you sad?

130
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,403
No! Mind your work

131
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,565
I'll chop your head off next time

132
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:36,826
Guard the door

133
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,976
Master, here is the baby boy you want

134
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:11,895
Take the 19th prince inside

135
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,800
With other princes together

136
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,098
Yes, Master

137
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,906
San

138
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:23,841
Your heart is beating too fast

139
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,107
Not quite

140
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:28,948
Memory does you no good

141
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,952
Feelings and emotions too

142
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,089
I don't have any

143
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:37,216
I'll wait for the next propitious day

144
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:41,125
And among the babies

145
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,993
Choose one to be the King

146
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:52,233
China must have a King!

147
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:56,138
China must have a King!

148
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:59,577
China must have a King!

149
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,331
Either you climb up by yourself

150
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:23,905
Or you fall down! No one can help!

151
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,235
Climb up!

152
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:29,408
Ching, climb up!

153
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:36,118
Don't fall down!

154
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:32,976
Having a nightmare again?

155
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:35,843
May I come in?

156
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,470
I'm working

157
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:40,378
Don't disturb me

158
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:44,884
I've been always dreaming
of the invisible robe

159
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:48,890
Last night, I dreamt it finally worked

160
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,585
Has it always been kept in the safe?

161
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,730
Yes, why?

162
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,663
The police called today

163
00:15:56,755 --> 00:16:00,999
Ask me how one can be invisible

164
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,970
Before the invisible robe is finished,

165
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,873
you don't want others to know about it

166
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:12,948
I want to keep it secret forever

167
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,641
Because this invention may easily be used

168
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,686
As a war weapon

169
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,822
Then why're you still working on it?

170
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,047
This invisible robe mean a lot to you?

171
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,989
When I'm glued to my work

172
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,656
I feel happy

173
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,232
Aren't you worried that I may steal it?

174
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:30,662
No!

175
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,894
People don't steal from themselves

176
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,631
Some coffee?

177
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,134
Yes, please

178
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,733
The dates of birth

179
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,408
of those 18 babies...

180
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,975
Are they related in any way?

181
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,645
Strange!

182
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,976
They all have a royal destiny

183
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,877
All fated to be emperor!

184
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,211
Emperor?

185
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,251
Who's caught so many little emperors?

186
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,825
Sister!

187
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,825
You want some? Come over then

188
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,635
Come on!

189
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,682
Are you talking to me?

190
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:05,811
No!

191
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:19,495
Sister, may I kiss you?

192
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,371
Why are you smiling?

193
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,604
Am I? Not really!

194
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:38,117


195
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,557
Go down...

196
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,925
Go down...

197
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,472
God! Who are they, Lau?

198
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,235
3 armed robbers with criminal records

199
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,704
Just robbed a cash escort car

200
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,640
And were driven there

201
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,574
8 hostages inside,

202
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,476
including drivers and guards

203
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,780
So, what to do?

204
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:06,848
We've getting them out

205
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:07,883
Give me one!

206
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:14,822
Get ready!

207
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:16,187
Fire!

208
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,893
Don't panic, tear bombs only Wear mask!

209
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,429
Come out!

210
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:31,130
Damn! Get out!

211
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:34,610
Give me the revolver!

212
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:40,780
Don't fire!

213
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,214
Listen

214
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,287
There're many more hostages inside

215
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,855
Get me a helicopter within 2 hours

216
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,788
Or I'll kill one every 5 minutes

217
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,783
Good morning everybody!

218
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,249
Who's she?

219
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,081
Professional shooter- Chat

220
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,225
Sir, don't call me that way

221
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,349
I only kill those that deserve

222
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,960
Call me thief-catcher

223
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,064
The police won't hire you

224
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,426
Hire?

225
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:33,035

I turn in, don't fire!

229
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,151
I turn in! Don't...

230
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:32,624
Rescue the hostages

231
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,127
Lie down...

232
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,544
Go and see if there's others

233
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,254
I'm married

234
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,417
Go!

235
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,163
Only I can

236
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,356
get your son back

237
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:12,230
Pay me 500 thousand if found alive

238
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,860
150 thousand if you don't mind he's dead

239
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:16,664
I only take gold Ring me if interested

240
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:18,302
My phone number!

241
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,018
The newspaper has been used!

242
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:04,916
The one placed the ad was not here
for babies

243
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:05,884
Ask the others to be alert

244
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:06,648
Yes, Officer Lau

245
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,291
Mrs Lau, you may go

246
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,451
Please show me your pass

247
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,631
What brings you here tonight?

248
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:18,734
I promised the head nurse

249
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,563
to come and help

250
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:21,328
The old lady up there...

251
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,770
Won't do physiotherapy until you come,
right?

252
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,272
So you know already!

253
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,170
I'm busy,

254
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,140
can't take care of you

255
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:29,040
Do take care

256
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,407
You too!

257
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,177
You're the one who placed the ad?

258
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,618
You're a cop?

259
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:18,917
Listen, I'm going to kill all babies tonight

260
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:29,628
What are you doing?

261
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,006
No...

262
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:38,140
Stand still, or I'll kill her!

263
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:39,646
Calm down!

264
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,407
Drop that!

265
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:42,745
Or I'll kill her

266
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,246
You drop it first

267
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:45,611
I'll kill her!

268
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,381
Okay! I drop it!

269
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:49,823
Go inside!

270
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,255
I'll kill her!

271
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:53,526
Go inside!

272
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:55,624
Those doctors killed my son

273
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,128
This is revenge!

274
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:00,368
I'll kill all the babies!

275
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,436
Doctor Wong,

276
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,972
please hurry to Casualty Ward

277
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,204
I'll kill all the babies!

278
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:12,171
You're bleeding! Wipe it off

279
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,544
I'm fine!

280
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,389
Do you think we can break the door?

281
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:21,751
No way! it's so thick!

282
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:24,092
Let me try!

283
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:39,903
The keys are just outside!

284
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:45,405
Almost get them!

285
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:46,914
Keep cool!

286
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,881
The loony won't be back so soon

287
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,653
I'm worried about the babies only

288
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:56,053
You heard what he said just now?

289
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:57,618
Let me try

290
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,376
Why don't you go?

291
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:37,865
Roger. Stay calm Say it slowly

292
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,235
One only?

293
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,064
Yes!

294
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:46,302
So late! New to here?

295
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:57,412
Take him out

296
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:58,452
Yes!

297
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,781
Don't move! Get up!

298
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:04,483
I won't leave any baby alive!

299
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:07,222
Lau!

300
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:09,996
I subdued the loony already!

301
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,122
I know!

302
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:12,629
Thanks for informing me in time

303
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:13,498
I didn't come for nothing!

304
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:14,467
Yes!

305
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:24,439
Any reward?

306
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:25,444
No!

307
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:28,849
Don't keep the old lady waiting

308
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,145
Done already!

309
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:38,427
Naughty! Laughing at me?

310
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,062
Are you leaving with me?

311
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,067
No! The real one hasn't turned up yet

312
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:46,124
What?

313
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:47,361
Why so surprised?

314
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,673
Busybody! Take you out for a ride!

315
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,944
Let's go!

316
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:01,081
Officer Lau, a baby is stolen

317
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,790
Don't shoot! The baby might be there!

318
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,736
Attention. Don't fire!

319
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:31,806
I'm leaving!

320
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,020
Go after her!

321
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:45,791
The thief-catcher?

322
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,604
Keep awake,

323
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,397
more fun to come

324
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,172
isn't it fun?

325
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,805
So there you are? Follow me!

326
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,469
Take a rest first!

327
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:32,332
Can't believe it! Lagging behind!

328
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,171
What a shame!

329
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,646
So sinister, not even a noise!

330
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,159
A woman!

331
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:53,057
A bitch!

332
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,645
Why did you steal so many babies?

333
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:12,646
What? You blame me for that?

334
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,211
You look pretty smart...

335
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,512
So you're the Wonder Woman?

336
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:17,847
And you're the thief-catcher?

337
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,818
Don't get in my way then!

338
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:23,087
How can you use

339
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:24,349
the baby as bait?

340
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:25,550
How despicable!

341
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:26,954
That's enough!

342
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:31,963
Put the baby down first

343
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,427
Let's see if you can make me do so!

344
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,799
Warm-up just now Ready?

345
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,238
Wait...

346
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,615
What's it?

347
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:30,991
The invisible thing?

348
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:35,123
One more?

349
00:32:58,343 --> 00:32:59,947
It seems to be on my side!

350
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:11,089
The baby?

351
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:21,036
Be careful!

352
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:42,195
How's the baby?

353
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:46,096
Wait, who are you?

354
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:51,168
Everything's fine now

355
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,020
Alright, don't try my patience!

356
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:07,952
Who are you?

357
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:09,281
Let's go, Chat!

358
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,582
San, it's you?

359
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:11,625
Let's go!

360
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:14,229
Don't pull me I can walk on my own

361
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:16,994
I suspect

362
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,666
the thief-catcher you hire

363
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:20,867
How do you know?

364
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:23,097
Ask her to bring the baby back at once!

365
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,309
Call the doctor

366
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,020
How's the baby?

367
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:41,714
Save him!

368
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:42,916
Count on me!

369
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:44,820
To Casualty ward!

370
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:22,795
Doctor, how's the baby?

371
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:26,458
Sorry, it's too late

372
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,278
Call his parents

373
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:12,574
Yes, Officer

374
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:18,876
Ching, don't go!

375
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:21,683
Master hates dummies like me

376
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,950
I'll miss you!

377
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,992
Take care of yourself

378
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:28,658
Don't cry!

379
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:31,856
Ching!

380
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:33,162
Let her go!

381
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:37,031
Kneel down

382
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:41,634
Tung, you must stay here

383
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,346
And finish

384
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,912
the task alone

385
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:48,481
You're going to uphold justice for me

386
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:50,550
Tung, why are you crying?

387
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,138
Tung, why are you crying?

388
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,770
No, I'm not

389
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,105
Tell me why

390
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,067
Nothing

391
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:19,039
How's the case today?

392
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,847
The baby fell to death!

393
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:39,825
It's been 10 years. You're still great

394
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:42,494
Where did that monster get invisible robe?

395
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:44,636
He's behind all this

396
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:46,206
Will you interfere?

397
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,001
No, thanks!

398
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:50,778
When I escaped from that cave,

399
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,074
you spared me though you caught me

400
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:55,476
Now I take good care of myself

401
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,950
Why did he catch so many babies?

402
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:01,318
He'll choose one to be king

403
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:02,616
The rest to leave behind

404
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,418
They'll become his killers, like us

405
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:06,926
and turn them into our generation

406
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:09,564
San, do them a favour

407
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,356
Simply kill them

408
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,191
For 3 years, that monster corrupted me

409
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:14,233
After I had escaped from him,

410
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,063
I spent 10 years

411
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,669
returning to normal

412
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,636
I don't want all babies becoming monsters

413
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:20,867
Pretend that you know nothing at all!

414
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,238
Leave this case alone!

415
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,970
If Master gives orders,

416
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:25,408
I'll kill you as well

417
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,282
Do it then!

418
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:32,552
You won't be lucky next time!

419
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,556
Can I pretend that I know nothing?

420
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,645
You are not Ching

421
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:01,648
From now on, you are San

422
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:18,092
Get the invisible robe within 10 days

423
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:20,759
and kill the doctor

424
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,165
Do it or you die

425
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,498
Duplicate

426
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,341
What are you doing?

427
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:45,925
It's dangerous here Go out please!

428
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:49,093
What's so dangerous?
You're always here

429
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,258
You're keeping something from me?

430
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,138
You knew everything already!

431
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,069
The invisible robe is belonged to us

432
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,767
Yet I don't know that it can stand UV light

433
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,843
No, not now

434
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:07,074
If it can, you'll be the first one to know

435
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:10,012
You kept your work secret these days

436
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,482
I'm working on this plant

437
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,828
They were dead before

438
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,262
But they're alive again

439
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:28,426
Any flowers?

440
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,038
Yes. In a month time

441
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,411
Ching

442
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:41,581
Will you put them under the sun everyday

443
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,274
and water them at night for me

444
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:48,886
Lucky stars,
you taught me how to make them

445
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:50,491
You shall see the flowers bloom

446
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,093
Get the invisible robe within 10 days

447
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:02,737
and kill the doctor

448
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,466
Do it or you die

449
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:10,638
Your men kept me for over 2 hours!

450
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,679
Don't blame me it's accident!

451
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:13,508
Accident?

452
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:15,014
The baby died because of you!

453
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:15,981
What?

454
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,346
It's all

455
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,421
the Wonder Woman's fault

456
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,350
You may go now

457
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,684
But you can't deceive yourself

458
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:27,962
Don't make a scapegoat of me!

459
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,395
OK, I'll keep an eye on it

460
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,865
Mainly keep an eye on my son, Miss!

461
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:38,334
Don't worry I'll help my client

462
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,406
Thank you!

463
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:41,167
I'm asking for trouble!

464
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,167
Well done

465
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:14,368
Why are there so many bird cages?

466
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:39,024
Oh no! That Monster's here!

467
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:10,426
Hey! Hey!

468
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:25,312
You've got the needles

469
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,953
Let's see how long you can stand!

470
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:42,957
You know who the intruder was?

471
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:43,996
No

472
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,727
I have someone in mind

473
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:50,963
But she should have died 10 years ago

474
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:52,073
Right!

475
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:54,436
I killed Chat myself

476
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:58,341
Now only Wonder Woman could get in

477
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:01,108
She's been meddling with our plan

478
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:02,511
She's probably the intruder

479
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:04,710
Let me kill her, Master

480
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:07,981
Leave such things to others

481
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,419
Kau

482
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:14,259
Kill the woman and, if necessary,

483
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,362
die with her

484
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,407
You monster!

485
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:37,848
I won't let the needles go up to my head!

486
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:03,611
This case is not related

487
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:06,077
to the others

488
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:07,408
We promised the Mayor that

489
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:09,208
it wouldn't happen again

490
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,717
Here's your deposit!

491
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:12,850
What deposit?

492
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,489
I quit the case of your son's business!

493
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:17,425
We'll talk later, I'm in the meeting

494
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,492
No!

495
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:19,719
Let's cut it off

496
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,228
You must have got hold of something

497
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:24,695
For the babies' sake Please tell us

498
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:26,732
What good does telling you?

499
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:29,233
If you can handle it you won't hire me

500
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:30,164
For the justice you should...

501
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,532
To hell with justice!

502
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,733
I almost got killed!

503
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:02,167
You killed the child!

504
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,275
Tell me what you know!

505
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,876
You think I'll listen to you?

506
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:10,306
You will!

507
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:11,980
When that baby fell down just now,

508
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:13,877
You saved it without a second thought

509
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:46,007
Yes, I killed the baby

510
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,779
But I'm dying too

511
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:51,543
Let break it even!

512
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:55,218
Won't you leave me alone?

513
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:58,417
I only want to die peaceful here

514
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:01,825
I want to know who snatched the babies

515
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:04,326
Don't hurt the Invisible Woman!

516
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:07,468
She's only a puppet

517
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:09,070
That old monster!

518
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:12,000
I won't let his needles killing me

519
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:12,970
Don't do that!

520
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:17,575
Go away before I lost my mind

521
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:20,975
No

522
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,080
You'll die!

523
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,146
If for a good reason, it's OK

524
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:32,457
I can stop the needles from going further

525
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:33,926
But I can't get them out

526
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:37,828
OK! I'll new you

527
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:39,968
to get the babies back

528
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:41,534
If we are to succeed,

529
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:42,966
we must get San to help us

530
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:44,003
The Invisible Woman?

531
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:46,641
Yes! Before I find her,

532
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:48,401
we must be careful

533
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:52,274
Because he found me entering his cave

534
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:53,573
He thinks that was you

535
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:55,739
So, he sends Kau out to kill you now

536
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,062
A loony holds hostages

537
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,705
in the station

538
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:19,306
He has destroyed
the computer system too

539
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:20,840
A cargo train is dashing

540
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:22,339
toward the station now

541
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:24,112
When will it be there?

542
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,338
In about 5 minutes

543
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:26,239
I've got it

544
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:47,327
All units get ready

545
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:56,171
Mind the mines!

546
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:00,047
Don't step on it

547
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,617
Don't move!

548
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:10,185
Be careful! There are mines!

549
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:21,458
Go now!

550
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:23,662
The train will be clash in one minute

551
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,034
Go in!

552
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:26,997
Save the hostages inside first

553
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:34,348
Why don't you go in?

554
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:02,334
Run!

555
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,431
It's coming

556
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:38,602
Let me try

557
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:18,684
Run!

558
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,947
Supervisor, how can we stop the train?

559
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,853
The loony's destroyed the computer

560
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:24,515
Can't stop it now!

561
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,302
Run! The train is here!

562
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:12,362
Take it!

563
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:19,845
Let's go!

564
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:00,746
Hubby

565
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,859
What did the doctor say?

566
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:12,724
If lucky, you could walk within 6 months

567
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:14,400
Otherwise?

568
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:18,864
Otherwise...

569
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:22,471
You may become a cripple

570
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:27,439
Cheer up!

571
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:30,173
As Wonder Woman's hubby,

572
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:33,014
I'll stand by you

573
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:35,821
When did you find out?

574
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:38,550
At the station,

575
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:44,123
when you looked at me, unwilling to go in

576
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:53,168
No more chuckling from now on

577
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:56,835
and no more secret tears

578
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:00,946
Just tell me everything

579
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:09,852
okay?

580
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:16,057
Oh, darling!

581
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:55,968
There's a flower bud!

582
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,779
What's wrong? Sit down first

583
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:12,181
No, I just got a clue

584
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:14,417
I must write it down now!

585
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:16,054
Sit down first!

586
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:17,849
Now, you go out

587
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:33,632
How long have you known this?

588
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:36,271
I knew it

589
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:40,038
When I was working on the invisible robe,

590
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:43,377
I found that it emitted toxins

591
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,510
So I always tell you to stay out of here

592
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:50,283
But the flowers have a bud already

593
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:54,759
It tells we'll be alright

594
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:57,095
Come on, get out of here!

595
00:55:57,253 --> 00:56:01,201
How can I leave you like this?

596
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:06,399
Where are my glasses?

597
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:07,971
You're wearing them!

598
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,318
Before the robe is completed...

599
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:20,953
I will not die

600
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:26,158
I can smell the fragrance of your hair

601
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:51,543
Don't cry!

602
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:59,316
Let's look at the flowers outside

603
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:11,596
I'll be alright

604
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:13,274
You get out of here!

605
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:23,715
Let me in!

606
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:28,546
I'll stay even if you can get in

607
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:36,689
The robe will be ready
when flowers bloom

608
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:39,526
You promised to take care
of them till then

609
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,568
You forget that?

610
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:54,070
San

611
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:57,481
You still go to see that monster?

612
00:57:57,874 --> 00:58:00,013
Anyway, he won't let the doctor live

613
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:02,747
He'll kill him once the robe is finished

614
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,523
You're poisoned by his needles?

615
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,930
If you help us,

616
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:11,298
Wonder Woman and I may kill him

617
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:32,878
If you fear death,

618
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:35,044
so why help her?

619
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:36,747
I won't thank you anyway

620
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:38,290
You saved my life

621
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:40,518
But to protect the doctor,

622
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:41,821
you let that monster control you

623
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:44,295
You know you've harmed
so many babies?

624
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:47,694
You can deceive others but not yourself

625
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:49,898
Wonder Woman can help you now

626
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,165
See you at the same spot tomorrow

627
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:53,569
I'll wait till you come

628
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:58,405
Don't fool me!

629
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:09,288
I can't wait, hurry up

630
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,051
I'll made it!

631
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:20,359
Ching... Ching!

632
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:31,070
Lucky star!

633
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:34,337
Ching, I make the invisible robe!

634
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:44,120
Why you still haven't got that robe?

635
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:48,160
It can't work under the sun yet

636
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,695
Without it,
the king's army may be weakened

637
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:53,595
it'll soon be finished

638
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:56,837
Give the doctor a few more days

639
00:59:56,993 --> 01:00:00,600
Get it anyway

640
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:03,243
before tomorrow sunset

641
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:06,176
Kau will help you then

642
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:10,415
Master, in your plan, all my work,

643
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,985
it is so inconsequential

644
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:16,784
If I find a king among those babies

645
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:19,859
you'll be honoured for your services

646
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:33,065
All princes should be asleep

647
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:35,469
You should go to sleep too

648
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:47,385
The 18th of September

649
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:50,923
Today...

650
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:52,959
I finally solve

651
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:56,062
the UV light problem

652
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:04,231
but that's the end of my life too

653
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,369
From the first working day,

654
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:11,040
I knew I would die of toxins

655
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:14,672
If Ching weren't here,

656
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:17,613
I wouldn't be able to face my life

657
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:22,754
If she knows that I only hope,

658
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:24,982
to take her hands

659
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:27,560
and see flowers with her,

660
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:31,393
will she... still kill me?

661
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:39,602
The day will come soon

662
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:42,703
Get the invisible robe anyway

663
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:49,241
and kill the doctor!

664
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:07,295
Doctor, I'll never return to you

665
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:10,766
I won't leave until I see you

666
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:12,235
Believe me,

667
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:14,971
you are in great danger

668
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:16,804
Leave the lab now!

669
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,580
Damn it!

670
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:24,547
Even the Wonder Woman is late!

671
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:28,245
I shouldn't say wait until they came!

672
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,080
Should I leave or not?

673
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,403
Great. Here you're!

674
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,630
Master sent me to kill you!

675
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:48,809
Wait, San

676
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:51,969
I won't let you go this time

677
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:54,078
You can do it without any conscience?

678
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:56,613
I must execute Master's order

679
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,441
But I can promise you

680
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,645
I'll do you a favour after you die

681
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:03,050
Wait! The one to die...

682
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:04,223
May be you

683
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:05,153
Tell me

684
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:07,055
your last wish now!

685
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:09,022
Take care of doctor then

686
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,062
Doctor?

687
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,415
Save Doctor for me

688
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:41,785
San, what're you doing?

689
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:42,861
She's not coming to kill

690
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:44,396
She came to kill herself

691
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:46,659
You give up your life to save him?

692
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,063
My life?

693
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,801
I am just a beast to kill

694
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:53,740
A beast won't have feelings

695
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:56,376
Or sacrifice itself for another

696
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:07,387
Life is meaningful

697
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:10,319
if you can face yourself

698
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,049
I simply can't face myself

699
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:13,717
I can't face him either

700
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:16,124
San...

701
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,726
So you're all leaving?

702
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,897
Damn, can't you stay?

703
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:27,870
My own bike is better!

704
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:31,338
Wait for me

705
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:38,009
San!

706
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:40,279
You can change yourself from now on?

707
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:42,252
So what? I'm still San!

708
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:44,448
You can be another Chat! Like her

709
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:47,584
Too late! Leave me alone!

710
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:55,632
Shit! Even a bike can't catch them up?

711
01:04:55,758 --> 01:04:56,532
Go!

712
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:03,600
You've shunned the past

713
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:05,507
So this is your true self!

714
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:07,112
I shan't live on then!

715
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:11,884
No!

716
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:26,591
God!

717
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,502
You two are in great trouble!

718
01:05:34,797 --> 01:05:35,935
So lucky. Brace up!

719
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:52,920
Tung?

720
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:55,161
Ching?

721
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:59,665
Let go of my hand, or we'll both fall!

722
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:00,800
No!

723
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:04,799
Hold it!

724
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:10,609
I can't hold on any longer!

725
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:14,507
I won't let go!

726
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:15,978
We must be together

727
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,983
it's you!

728
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:21,248
You two knew each other?

729
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:26,182
I don't remember

730
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:27,520
The past is not important

731
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:30,254
But today, well lived

732
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:34,195
Say! What do you want to do?

733
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:37,160
Master sent Kau to kill Doctor

734
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:38,770
Save him

735
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:40,233
Doctor?

736
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:12,965
Give it to me

737
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:46,163
The invisible robe is UV light-proof now

738
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:47,864
Nobody can find it

739
01:07:49,498 --> 01:07:51,102
No!

740
01:07:55,938 --> 01:08:00,978
Ching, I want to talk to you

741
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:03,279
All inside the gift box

742
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:18,903
However hard you hit, it's useless

743
01:08:19,061 --> 01:08:20,768
He'll stick to what he wants

744
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:29,514
No! You can't give him

745
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:31,342
I've got nothing now

746
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:32,848
I can't let him die!

747
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,796
Sorry!

748
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:56,733
Master can't make you kill me

749
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:15,656
it's not that easy!

750
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:25,168
Wait...

751
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:55,258
Idiot, here's the tape

752
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:57,763
Come and get it!

753
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:07,642
Goodbye!

754
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,643
It's too hot to stay here

755
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:41,070
it's better

756
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:43,272
to have this thing destroyed

757
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:44,947
Let's go!

758
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:52,256
You go first

759
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:53,318
What about you...

760
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:54,823
Leave her alone!

761
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,458
Where are we going?

762
01:10:57,686 --> 01:10:59,632
To save the babies from the cave

763
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:03,201
Only two of us? Let me get my stuffs first

764
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:10,735
May I look at the blooming flowers?

765
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:57,146
All the babies are here

766
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:58,724
Don't touch anything

767
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:01,589
Babies will die if there's a fight

768
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:26,246
Monster, come and let die!

769
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:28,649
Beware, there is full of methane

770
01:12:35,217 --> 01:12:37,356
Monster, like methane more than oxygen

771
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:38,589
I'll kill you

772
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:45,468
How dare you are to come here?

773
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:46,699
Attack her

774
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:51,070
Supernatural power?

775
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:10,296
You kneel down?

776
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:11,897
Where's your guts?

777
01:13:13,322 --> 01:13:14,266
I can't help it

778
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:15,800
My legs get limp

779
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:18,766
You think you can beat me?

780
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:22,034
It's no use kneeling Guards, go

781
01:13:22,698 --> 01:13:24,006
We've got no exit now

782
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:26,407
Let's you get Master, I handle others

783
01:13:26,635 --> 01:13:28,012
Go!

784
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:10,084
It's an honour to die before me

785
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:12,924
I'm excited Is the methane caused it?

786
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:14,822
What to do? We can't get him

787
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:16,760
Don't let him concentrate

788
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:19,388
I'll kill you this time

789
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:41,818
Tung, go with Chat

790
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:43,250
No, I'll fight to the end

791
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:44,153
No

792
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:47,052
You'll get poisoned if you stay

793
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:58,131
Get some oxygen first

794
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:23,121
Go to hell, all of you!

795
01:15:48,977 --> 01:15:51,583
He's blown up to pieces this time!

796
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:55,958
Why this one so late?

797
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:57,121
He's still alive!

798
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:18,407
To hell with you!

799
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:25,517
He's afraid of light!

800
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:26,953
Some more

801
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:26,886
Is my face still looking good?

802
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:30,249
What?

803
01:17:30,345 --> 01:17:31,323
I don't know if you're alright

804
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,221
But you scare me!

805
01:17:49,898 --> 01:17:51,206
He's not yet dead?

806
01:18:17,592 --> 01:18:18,764
How can that be!

807
01:18:18,894 --> 01:18:20,202
His body is gone,

808
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:22,397
but his mind still there

809
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:49,266
He's gained control of me

810
01:18:49,925 --> 01:18:51,199
Let me help you

811
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:52,667
Don't get near!

812
01:18:57,899 --> 01:18:59,572
I can't control myself

813
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:07,015
Go. Quick!

814
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:09,150
Go with Chat

815
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:38,744
What to do?

816
01:19:38,907 --> 01:19:39,783
That way!

817
01:19:56,758 --> 01:19:58,135
Ching

818
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:00,500
Don't let me do it again

819
01:20:00,862 --> 01:20:03,570
Shit!

820
01:20:03,765 --> 01:20:06,507
Go to hell!

821
01:20:07,269 --> 01:20:08,771
Go!

822
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:12,843
You son of a bitch!

823
01:20:32,093 --> 01:20:34,073
He's controlling my mind, go!

824
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:36,073
We won't leave you behind

825
01:20:36,231 --> 01:20:38,609
I feel so good to see you again!

826
01:20:40,635 --> 01:20:42,080
Sorry!

827
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:44,582
San!

828
01:20:48,276 --> 01:20:49,755
San! Ching!

829
01:20:49,945 --> 01:20:53,518
I'll die with you, monster!

830
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:59,758
China must have a king...

831
01:21:07,462 --> 01:21:09,499
What's important is today, not the past

832
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:18,015
China must have a king!

833
01:21:19,574 --> 01:21:26,389
We watch the flowers bloom together?

834
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:29,392
Doctor!

835
01:21:56,778 --> 01:21:58,086
Ching

836
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:02,152
You won't die

837
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:07,928
Get to the ground first

838
01:22:08,156 --> 01:22:09,999
Otherwise I'll die

839
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:19,778
Are you alright?

840
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:22,177
Where's Chat?

841
01:22:23,204 --> 01:22:25,548
Get something good

842
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:28,449
Take one, or when the press comes,

843
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:31,181
we'll look shabby!

844
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:33,459
Come on, put them on!

845
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:07,088
The police has solved

846
01:23:07,215 --> 01:23:09,058
the babies case

847
01:23:09,284 --> 01:23:12,527
Most missing babies have been found

848
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:15,258
Here's our live report

849
01:23:15,423 --> 01:23:16,595
We heart that

850
01:23:16,925 --> 01:23:18,302
3 heroines solved it

851
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:21,066
How are they related to the police?

852
01:23:21,196 --> 01:23:23,733
They are close friends of the police

853
01:23:23,865 --> 01:23:25,310
What are their positions?

854
01:23:25,433 --> 01:23:26,275
No comment

855
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:29,211
When will they come again?

856
01:23:29,404 --> 01:23:31,406
When we are in need

857
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:33,882
What are their names?

858
01:23:34,442 --> 01:23:36,854
Their names?

859
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:39,116
They are called The Heroic Trio

860
01:23:40,115 --> 01:23:41,651
When did we get that name?

861
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:42,692
How do you know that?

862
01:23:42,951 --> 01:23:43,588
Where does the name come from?

863
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:45,754
It's our top secret, sorry...

864
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,228
it's an improvisation only

865
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:50,428
Who meet...

866
01:23:50,592 --> 01:23:54,267
with whom?

867
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:57,967
I get through every pass

868
01:23:58,166 --> 01:24:01,773
passing station to station

869
01:24:01,936 --> 01:24:05,179
I've gone through many things

870
01:24:05,507 --> 01:24:09,319
One moment

871
01:24:09,444 --> 01:24:13,017
One move

872
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:16,821
They become a legend

873
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:20,522
Sadness and romance

874
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:24,328
happen around us

875
01:24:24,592 --> 01:24:28,096
Challenge and dream

876
01:24:28,296 --> 01:24:31,834
happen each day

877
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:35,310
I've gone through many things

878
01:24:35,603 --> 01:24:39,449
One moment

879
01:24:39,607 --> 01:24:43,020
One move

880
01:24:43,278 --> 01:24:46,953
They become a legend

881
01:24:47,682 --> 01:24:51,129
I have had happiness and sadness

882
01:24:51,352 --> 01:24:54,629
And I walk on my way carefully

883
01:24:54,789 --> 01:24:58,601
But I'm still myself

884
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:02,274
I'm still on my way
ignoring the gossip

885
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:06,009
I don't care if someone is like me

886
01:25:06,334 --> 01:25:09,838
Regardless anything happen

887
01:25:10,171 --> 01:25:13,641
No matter who is in my company

888
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:17,287
we shall walk together

889
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:20,858
Sadness and romance

890
01:25:20,982 --> 01:25:24,691
happen around us

891
01:25:24,853 --> 01:25:28,266
Challenge and dream

892
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:32,336
happen each day

893
01:25:32,527 --> 01:25:35,531
I've gone through many things

894
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:39,701
One moment

895
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:43,077
One move
