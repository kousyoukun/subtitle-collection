1
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,835
<i>The city is shocked by missing baby cases.</i>

2
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:11,548
<i>Eighteen babies were taken in the past three months.</i>

3
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,510
<i>The police have made no breakthrough</i>

4
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:15,969
<i>and the investigations have reached the bottleneck.</i>

5
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,555
<i>-The Commissioner of Police…</i> -All my clients have good lives.

6
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,642
Here we are. Stop!

7
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:23,602
I'm coming!

8
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,146
Something is wrong.

9
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,150
Damn it.

10
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,652
Forget it.

11
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,695
Be careful.

12
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:37,866
Look! It's a stylish building!

13
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,451
Let's take a look inside.

14
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,746
This way, please.

15
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,667
This way. This house is elegant

16
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:50,712
and there is no one else here within 1 km.

17
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:54,174
It's only a five-minute ride to the market.

18
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:57,052
This house can't be that perfect. Surely there must be some defects.

19
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,387
There is a little defect,

20
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:00,097
but it won't be a problem.

21
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,431
This way.

22
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,018
The defect is that

23
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,812
it's not really renovated.

24
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,568
You call this as not really renovated?

25
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,861
The structure is fine.

26
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,321
There was just a little fire.

27
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:19,324
-Honey. -Hush.

28
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,746
I'll show you something.

29
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,003
Nature!

30
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,010
You'll love this place in no time.

31
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,388
What do you think?

32
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,724
Damn it. I've asked the owner

33
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,100
to renovate the house first.

34
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:46,935
What a waste of time!

35
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,440
How lucky!

36
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,276
Who the hell would buy it now?

37
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,694
Damn it!

38
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:56,403
Let's go.

39
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,905
Don't move!

40
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,450
Dear, let's buy it.

41
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:02,701
I like it.

42
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,203
It has character.

43
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:05,787
Character?

44
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,581
-Really? -You know how I like it.

45
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:08,665
I know.

46
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,293
Pay the deposit first then.

47
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,461
Quiet!

48
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:34,900
Did you try to steal my car? Put this on yourself.

49
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:38,570
Okay, I'll put it on myself.

50
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,989
Incredible!

51
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,618
Of course. My husband is a policeman.

52
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,454
Keep walking.

53
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,497
Aren't I walking now?

54
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:50,123
<i>Up until today,</i>

55
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:53,001
18 babies went missing in the past two months.

56
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,713
They seem like the work of one person.

57
00:04:56,922 --> 00:05:00,175
None of the missing babies' families

58
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,885
has received any blackmail letters so far.

59
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,513
Nor has any political or terrorist group

60
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,514
claimed responsibility.

61
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,599
Chief, this is bizarre.

62
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,686
Shall we approach Wonder Woman?

63
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:14,314
Even though she helped us before,

64
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,942
we still don't know who she is.

65
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,444
We can't reach her at all.

66
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,947
All missing babies are boys.

67
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:25,993
This shows that it's not blackmailing.

68
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,036
喂…
Hey…

69
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,163
Maybe it has something to do with cults.

70
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,269
Did anyone rush out of the conference room?

71
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:53,228
No.

72
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,939
Chief!

73
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:04,239
（下一个将会是你的儿子）

74
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,088
Come with me.

75
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:27,137
The babies' ward is upstairs. Operation rooms are over there.

76
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:30,933
I'm worried about our son.

77
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,060
Let's take him home now.

78
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,269
Lau!

79
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,188
He was just born this morning.

80
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,481
The doctor won't take the risk if we discharge him now.

81
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:38,190
Lau--

82
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,608
Fine! We'll leave him here.

83
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,402
Why didn't you call Wonder Woman for help?

84
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,072
Ma'am, we have no way to contact her.

85
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,241
I've sent more men here.

86
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:47,991
Staying here

87
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,244
is just as safe as staying at home.

88
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:53,413
Take care of her!

89
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:54,748
Okay.

90
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,500
Chief, Officer Lau, there's a bus crash in the Southern District just now.

91
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,377
The warden might need these beds,

92
00:06:58,544 --> 00:06:59,753
so we need to think about it.

93
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:02,130
Lau. You may leave first.

94
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:09,972
Lau. It's my son that they are after.

95
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,975
How about we find someone

96
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,434
to swap with my son?

97
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,894
Whose son?

98
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:18,480
I guess that's immoral.

99
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,065
They want your son.

100
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,942
They will find him eventually.

101
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:26,363
Yes, it'd be embarrassing if others knew.

102
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:28,532
Let's brace ourselves.

103
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,619
撑…
Brace ourselves.…

104
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,538
I'm sorry, ma'am.

105
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:35,789
Officer Lau said no one can enter

106
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,165
without his permission.

107
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,333
Forget it! Look up there!

108
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,502
What's wrong?

109
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,213
The babies are falling down!

110
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,090
-Catch them! -Catch them!

111
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,592
-My son! -My son!

112
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,135
Catch our son!

113
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:31,887
Which one is our son?

114
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,555
Either one of them can be him!

115
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,432
Which one?

116
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:04,711
Wonder Woman!

117
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,966
-Wonder Woman! -Wonder Woman!

118
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,644
She's coming down!

119
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,906
There's some blood on the wall. Run some tests on it.

120
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,712
This is not our baby. This is not our baby!

121
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:32,090
It's a girl!

122
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:35,511
-A girl? It's my daughter! -Hey!

123
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:39,431
I'm so glad you are fine. -I was so scared. -This is bad.

124
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,808
Get someone to collect the blood sample.

125
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:43,810
-Yes, sir. Come with me. -Okay.

126
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,111
-Hello? <i>-Tung-tung, another baby is missing.</i>

127
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,030
<i>I'll be back late tonight.</i>

128
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,240
Okay.

129
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:57,824
<i>Are you upset?</i>

130
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,410
No. Work hard tonight. <i>-Goodbye.</i> -Goodbye.

131
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,547
You always like to fight. I'll chop off your head next time.

132
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:36,798
Guard the door!

133
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,976
Master, here is the baby boy you want.

134
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:11,875
Take the 19th prince inside

135
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,795
to rest with the other princes.

136
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,088
Yes, Master.

137
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:17,881
Sum.

138
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:23,804
Your heart is beating too fast.

139
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,097
No, it's not.

140
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:28,934
Memories do you no good,

141
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:31,937
neither do feelings or emotions.

142
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:33,063
I don't have any.

143
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:37,192
I'll wait for the next auspicious day.

144
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:41,113
Among all the babies,

145
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:44,992
I'll choose one to be the emperor.

146
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,207
China must have an emperor.

147
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:56,128
China must have an emperor.

148
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:59,548
China must have an emperor.

149
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,319
China must have an emperor.

150
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,906
Either you climb up by yourself or you will fall! No one can help you.

151
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,240
Climb up!

152
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:29,369
Ching-ching, climb up!

153
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:36,084
Don't fall! Climb!

154
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:32,975
Did you have a nightmare again?

155
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:35,811
May I come in?

156
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:37,437
I'm working.

157
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:40,357
You know I don't want anyone to disturb me.

158
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:44,862
I've been dreaming of the invisible robe every night for years.

159
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:48,866
Last night, I dreamt that it was finally completed.

160
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,577
Has it always been kept in the safe?

161
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,704
Yes, why?

162
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:56,665
The police called today

163
00:15:56,748 --> 00:16:00,961
and asked me how one can be invisible.

164
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,967
Before the invisible robe is finished,

165
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,844
you don't want others to know about it.

166
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:12,931
Even if it's finished, I want to keep it a secret forever

167
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,600
because an invention like this

168
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,686
may easily be used as a war weapon.

169
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:19,813
Then why are you still working on it?

170
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:21,023
What does it mean to you?

171
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,984
I feel the happiest

172
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,653
when I'm glued to my work.

173
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,239
Don't you worry that I'd steal it?

174
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:30,657
No.

175
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,868
You can't steal what's already yours.

176
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:36,622
Do you want some coffee?

177
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,123
Yes, please.

178
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:43,730
Miss, the dates of birth

179
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:45,399
生辰八字…
of those 18 babies…

180
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:46,942
Are they related in any way?

181
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,610
It's strange.

182
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,947
They all have a royal destiny.

183
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:53,866
They are all fated to be emperors!

184
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,200
Emperors?

185
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,244
Why would anyone kidnap so many little emperors?

186
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:02,791
My sister!

187
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:37,826
Do you want some? Come over then.

188
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:51,632
Come. Come.

189
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:00,682
Are you talking to me?

190
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,812
No.

191
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:19,493
<i>May I kiss you?</i>

192
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,334
Why are you smiling?

193
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:29,586
Am I? It's nothing.

194
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,095
Go down!

195
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,520
Stand on one side!

196
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,897
-Stand together! Quickly! -Quickly!

197
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,446
Gosh! Who are they, Lau?

198
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:58,240
Three armed robbers with criminal records

199
00:19:58,448 --> 00:19:59,700
just robbed a cash escort car

200
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,618
and were chased here by our men.

201
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:02,578
There are eight hostages inside

202
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,454
including drivers and guards.

203
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:05,747
What do we do now?

204
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:06,832
We will force them out.

205
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:07,875
Give me one!

206
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:14,798
Get ready!

207
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:16,175
Fire!

208
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:23,891
-Calm down, it's tear gas. Wear masks! -Wear masks!

209
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:28,395
Get out!

210
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:31,106
Damn! Get out!

211
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,610
Quickly!

212
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:40,741
Give me the revolver!

213
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:42,201
-Don't fire! -Listen up!

214
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:44,286
There are many more hostages inside!

215
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,830
Get me a helicopter in two hours

216
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:49,750
or I'll kill one hostage every five minutes!

217
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:15,776
Hello, sirs!

218
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,237
Who is she?

219
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:20,072
A professional gunner, Chan Chat.

220
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:22,199
Sir, don't call me that.

221
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:24,326
I only kill those who deserve to die.

222
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:25,953
Call me Thief Catcher.

223
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,038
The police won't hire you.

224
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:29,414
Hire?

225
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:33,001
Sir, I'll do you a favor this time.

226
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:34,461
It's free of charge.

227
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:20,799
-Get them! -Yes, sir!

228
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,598
我投降了别开枪呀
I surrender! Don't fire! I surrender! Don't…

229
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:31,143
Rescue the hostages! -Rescue the hostages. -Let's go.

230
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,603
-Rescue the hostages. -Come on!

231
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:40,110
Lie down!

232
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,537
Go and see if there are still hostages inside!

233
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,259
I'm married.

234
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:05,385
So?

235
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:07,137
It seems like

236
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:09,348
only I can get your son back.

237
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:12,226
Pay me 500,000 if he's alive

238
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:14,853
and 150,000 if you don't mind he's dead.

239
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,647
I only take gold. Here's my number.

240
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:18,273
Call me after you've thought about it.

241
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:02,985
The newspaper has been used.

242
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:04,903
The one who placed the advertisement is

243
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:05,863
not here for the babies. Warn the others.

244
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:06,613
Yes, sir.

245
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:08,282
Mrs. Lau, you may go.

246
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:11,410
Please show me your pass.

247
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,624
What brings you here tonight?

248
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:18,709
I promised the head nurse

249
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:20,544
to come and help every alternate day.

250
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:21,295
The old lady up there--

251
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,755
Won't do physiotherapy without you.

252
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:25,257
So you know that already.

253
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:26,133
I'm busy.

254
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:28,135
I can't take care of you.

255
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,011
Stay safe.

256
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:30,387
You too.

257
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12,179
Are you the one who placed the advertisement?

258
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:13,597
Are you a cop?

259
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:18,894
Listen. I'm going to kill all the babies tonight.

260
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,613
What are you doing?

261
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,992
No!

262
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:38,121
Don't move or I'll kill her!

263
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:39,623
Calm down.

264
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:41,375
Drop that!

265
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:42,709
Or I'll kill her!

266
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:44,211
Drop that knife first!

267
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:45,587
I'll kill her!

268
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:47,381
Okay! I'm dropping it!

269
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:49,800
Go inside!

270
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:51,260
I'll kill her!

271
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:53,512
Go inside!

272
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:55,597
Those doctors killed my son.

273
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:57,099
This is my revenge!

274
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:00,352
-I'll kill all those babies! <i>-Dr. Wong.</i>

275
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:02,437
<i>Please hurry to the emergency ward.</i>

276
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:04,940
<i>Dr. Wong, please hurry to the emergency--</i>

277
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:08,193
I'll kill all the babies!

278
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:12,155
You're bleeding! Wipe it off.

279
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:13,532
I'm fine.

280
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:19,371
Hey. Do you think we can break down the door?

281
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:21,748
No way, it's too thick.

282
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:24,084
Let me try.

283
00:26:38,182 --> 00:26:39,892
The keys are just outside.

284
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:45,397
Just a bit more and I could get them!

285
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:46,899
Calm down.

286
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:48,859
The madman won't be back so soon.

287
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,655
I'm only worried about the babies.

288
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:56,033
Didn't you hear what he said just now?

289
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:57,618
Let me try.

290
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:20,349
Why aren't you leaving?

291
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:37,866
Roger that.

292
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:41,203
Stay calm, speak slowly.

293
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,037
-Just one person? -<i>Yes!</i>

294
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:46,291
You are late! Are you new here?

295
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,386
Take him out.

296
00:27:57,553 --> 00:27:58,428
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

297
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:01,765
Don't move! Get up!

298
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:04,476
-I'll kill all the babies! -Move!

299
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,229
<i>Dear!</i> <i>Dear?</i>

300
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:09,982
I have captured the madman.

301
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:11,108
I know.

302
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,609
Thank you for informing me on time.

303
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:13,485
I didn't come here for nothing.

304
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,444
Come here.

305
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:24,413
Any rewards?

306
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,414
No!

307
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:28,834
Don't keep the old lady waiting.

308
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:30,127
It's done already.

309
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:38,427
Naughty! Are you laughing at me?

310
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:43,056
Are you leaving with me?

311
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,058
No. The real one hasn't turned up yet.

312
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,101
What?

313
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,352
Why are you surprised?

314
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,648
You're nosy. Let's go for a ride.

315
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:56,945
Let's go!

316
00:28:59,198 --> 00:29:01,074
Officer Lau, someone is kidnapping a baby.

317
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,756
Don't shoot! The baby might be in there!

318
00:29:20,302 --> 00:29:21,720
Attention. Don't fire! Don't fire!

319
00:29:30,646 --> 00:29:31,772
I'm leaving!

320
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:42,991
-Go after her! -Go after her!

321
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:45,786
The Thief Catcher?

322
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:54,586
Hey, Nosy. What's with your mouth?

323
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:56,380
Don't sleep. More fun is coming.

324
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:58,173
Isn't it fun?

325
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,805
There you are. Follow me!

326
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:27,452
Let's take a rest first.

327
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:32,332
I can't believe you still can't get me.

328
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:34,168
What a shame.

329
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:48,640
Not even a noise? That's sinister!

330
00:30:49,725 --> 00:30:51,143
So you're a woman!

331
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:53,020
So you're a bitch!

332
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,620
Why did you kidnap all those babies?

333
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:12,623
What? You're blaming me for that?

334
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,209
You look pretty smart.

335
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:16,502
Are you that Wonder Woman?

336
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:17,836
Are you the Thief Catcher?

337
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:19,796
Don't get in my way then!

338
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:23,050
How could you use a baby

339
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,343
as your bait?

340
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,511
How despicable!

341
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:26,929
That's enough!

342
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:31,934
Put the baby down first.

343
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:34,394
Let's see if you can make me do that!

344
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:07,761
That was just a warm-up. Now, it's the real thing!

345
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:17,229
Hey, wait!

346
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:26,613
What's happening?

347
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:30,951
Invisible Woman?

348
00:32:33,996 --> 00:32:35,122
There's one more person here?

349
00:32:58,353 --> 00:32:59,938
She seems to be on my side.

350
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:11,074
The baby!

351
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:21,001
Be careful!

352
00:33:40,312 --> 00:33:42,189
How's the baby? Hey!

353
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:46,068
Wait, who are you? Hey!

354
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:51,156
Everything's fine now.

355
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:07,005
All right, don't test my patience!

356
00:34:07,172 --> 00:34:07,923
Who are you?

357
00:34:08,257 --> 00:34:09,258
Let's go, Chan Chat!

358
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,551
Chan Sum? It's you?

359
00:34:10,676 --> 00:34:11,593
Let's go!

360
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,221
Don't pull me! I can walk on my own!

361
00:34:16,223 --> 00:34:16,974
Chief, I suspect the Thief Catcher you hired is the one

362
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:18,642
behind this incident today.

363
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:20,853
<i>How do you know?</i>

364
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:23,063
Ask her to bring the baby back at once.

365
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:36,285
Call the doctor.

366
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:40,998
How's the baby?

367
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:41,707
Save him.

368
00:34:41,832 --> 00:34:42,916
You can count on me.

369
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:44,793
To the emergency ward!

370
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:22,789
Doctor, how's the baby?

371
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:26,460
I'm sorry, it's too late. I couldn't save him.

372
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:11,255
Call his parents.

373
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,548
Yes, sir.

374
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:18,846
Ching-ching, don't go!

375
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:21,682
Our master hates idiots like me.

376
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:23,934
I'll miss you.

377
00:36:24,101 --> 00:36:25,978
Take care of yourself.

378
00:36:27,396 --> 00:36:28,647
Don't cry.

379
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:31,859
Ching-ching!

380
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:33,151
Let her go!

381
00:36:35,904 --> 00:36:37,030
Kneel down.

382
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:41,618
Tung-tung. You must stay here

383
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:44,329
and fulfill the fate you and your martial sister

384
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:45,914
shared alone.

385
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:48,458
You're going to uphold justice for me

386
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:50,544
on your own.

387
00:37:07,144 --> 00:37:09,104
Tung-tung, why are you crying?

388
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:10,731
No, I'm not.

389
00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:14,109
Tell me why.

390
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:16,069
It's nothing.

391
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:19,031
How's the case today?

392
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:24,828
The missing baby fell to his death.

393
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,801
It has been ten years. You're still great.

394
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:42,471
Where did that monster get an invisible robe?

395
00:37:42,804 --> 00:37:44,640
He's behind all this.

396
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:46,183
Are you going to interfere?

397
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:47,976
No, thank you.

398
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,771
When I escaped from that cave,

399
00:37:50,938 --> 00:37:53,065
you spared me even though you've already caught me.

400
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:55,442
Now I'm taking good care of myself.

401
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:57,945
What does he want so many babies for?

402
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:01,281
He'll choose one to be the emperor in the next eclipse.

403
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:02,616
And the rest

404
00:38:02,783 --> 00:38:04,409
will become his killers like us?

405
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:06,912
Moreover, Master would even turn them into Chan Gau.

406
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:09,540
Chan Sum, do them a favor.

407
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:11,333
Just kill the babies.

408
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:13,168
That monster has corrupted me for three years.

409
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:14,211
After I had escaped,

410
00:38:14,378 --> 00:38:15,045
I've spent ten years

411
00:38:15,337 --> 00:38:17,631
to return to normal!

412
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:19,633
I don't want the babies to become monsters.

413
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,843
Just pretend that you know nothing

414
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:22,219
and leave them alone.

415
00:38:22,386 --> 00:38:23,971
If Master gives the order,

416
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:25,389
I'd kill you as well.

417
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:27,266
Do it then!

418
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:32,521
You won't be so lucky next time!

419
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:38,527
Now that you've told me everything, how can I feign ignorance?

420
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:58,630
You won't be called Ching-ching anymore.

421
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:01,633
From now on, you are Chan Sum!

422
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:18,066
<i>You must get the invisible robe in ten days</i>

423
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:20,736
<i>and kill the professor after that.</i>

424
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:23,155
<i>Do it or you'll die.</i>

425
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:24,489
Hey, what are you doing?

426
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:35,334
I've told you many times.

427
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:45,928
It's dangerous here. Leave, please!

428
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:49,097
What's so dangerous? You're always here.

429
00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:52,226
Are you keeping something from me?

430
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:57,105
You already know everything.

431
00:39:57,272 --> 00:39:59,066
You said the robe is mine too,

432
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:01,735
but I didn't know it can stand UV light.

433
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:03,820
No, it still can't.

434
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:07,074
You'll be the first one to know if it can.

435
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:09,993
What have you been working on these past few days then?

436
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:15,457
I'm working on this Revival Box.

437
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:19,795
These were dead before,

438
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:22,256
but they are alive again.

439
00:40:27,386 --> 00:40:28,428
Do they have any flowers?

440
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:31,014
Yes. They will bloom in a month.

441
00:40:34,935 --> 00:40:36,395
Sum-ching.

442
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:41,567
Will you put them under the sun every day

443
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,277
and water them at night?

444
00:40:45,654 --> 00:40:48,866
You taught me how to make these lucky stars.

445
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:50,450
You'll see them bloom.

446
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:00,085
<i>You must get the invisible robe in ten days</i>

447
00:41:00,252 --> 00:41:02,713
<i>and kill the professor after that.</i>

448
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,465
<i>Do it or you'll die.</i>

449
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:10,637
Hey! Your men kept me for over two hours!

450
00:41:10,762 --> 00:41:12,639
Don't blame me. It was an accident!

451
00:41:12,848 --> 00:41:13,473
Accident?

452
00:41:13,682 --> 00:41:15,017
The baby died because of you!

453
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:15,976
What?

454
00:41:16,143 --> 00:41:17,311
I didn't drop him!

455
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:19,396
It's Wonder Woman's fault that she couldn't save him!

456
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:20,314
You may go now,

457
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:22,649
but you can't deceive yourself.

458
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:27,946
Hey! Enough!

459
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:31,366
Stop making me the scapegoat!

460
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,829
Fine, it's my loss. I'll keep an eye on it.

461
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,332
Keep an extra eye on my son, miss.

462
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:39,374
-Don't worry, I'll help my client. -Thank you!

463
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:41,168
I'm just asking for trouble!

464
00:42:05,192 --> 00:42:06,151
Done.

465
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:14,368
Why are there so many birdcages?

466
00:42:36,974 --> 00:42:39,017
This is bad! That monster is here!

467
00:43:06,712 --> 00:43:10,424
Hey! Hey!

468
00:43:23,896 --> 00:43:25,314
I still got hit!

469
00:43:33,113 --> 00:43:34,948
Let's see how long you can stand it.

470
00:43:37,326 --> 00:43:42,956
Do you know who the intruder was?

471
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:43,999
No.

472
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:46,710
I have someone in mind,

473
00:43:46,877 --> 00:43:50,964
but she should have died ten years ago.

474
00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:52,049
Yes.

475
00:43:52,216 --> 00:43:54,426
I killed Chan Chat myself.

476
00:43:54,593 --> 00:43:58,305
Now, only Wonder Woman could get in by herself.

477
00:43:58,514 --> 00:44:01,099
She has been meddling with our plan.

478
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:02,476
She's probably the intruder.

479
00:44:02,684 --> 00:44:04,686
Let me kill her, Master.

480
00:44:04,853 --> 00:44:07,940
Leave it to the others.

481
00:44:08,148 --> 00:44:09,399
Chan Gau.

482
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:14,238
Kill the woman. And if necessary,

483
00:44:14,488 --> 00:44:16,365
die with her.

484
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:35,384
You damned monster.

485
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:37,845
I won't let the needles go up to my head.

486
00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:03,620
We proved that this case is unrelated

487
00:45:03,745 --> 00:45:06,039
to the previous incidents.

488
00:45:06,248 --> 00:45:07,374
We promised the mayor

489
00:45:07,624 --> 00:45:09,209
it wouldn't happen again.

490
00:45:10,377 --> 00:45:11,712
Here's your deposit!

491
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:12,838
What deposit?

492
00:45:13,005 --> 00:45:14,464
I'm not pursuing your son's case!

493
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:17,426
Hey! We'll talk later. I'm in a meeting.

494
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:18,468
No!

495
00:45:18,635 --> 00:45:19,720
The deal is off!

496
00:45:19,845 --> 00:45:22,222
Miss. You must have gotten hold of something.

497
00:45:22,431 --> 00:45:24,683
Please tell us for the babies' sake.

498
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,727
What good would it do to me?

499
00:45:26,935 --> 00:45:29,229
You won't hire me if you can handle it.

500
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:30,147
For justice, you should--

501
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:31,523
You must have gotten hold of something.

502
00:45:31,648 --> 00:45:33,734
I almost got killed!

503
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:02,137
You killed the baby!

504
00:46:05,307 --> 00:46:07,267
Tell me what you know.

505
00:46:07,434 --> 00:46:08,852
Do you think I'd listen to you?

506
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:10,270
You will.

507
00:46:10,521 --> 00:46:11,980
When that baby is falling down,

508
00:46:12,147 --> 00:46:13,857
you saved it without a second thought.

509
00:46:42,845 --> 00:46:45,973
Yes, I killed the baby.

510
00:46:46,974 --> 00:46:48,767
But I'm dying too.

511
00:46:49,518 --> 00:46:51,520
We are even now!

512
00:46:53,438 --> 00:46:55,190
Won't you leave me alone?

513
00:46:55,357 --> 00:46:58,402
I only want to die in peace!

514
00:46:58,569 --> 00:47:01,822
I want to know who took the babies.

515
00:47:02,614 --> 00:47:04,324
Don't hurt the Invisible Woman!

516
00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:07,452
She's only a puppet.

517
00:47:07,578 --> 00:47:09,037
That damned monster!

518
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:11,999
I won't let his needles kill me.

519
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:12,958
Don't do that!

520
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:17,546
Go away before I lose my mind.

521
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,966
I'm not leaving.

522
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,051
You'll die!

523
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:26,138
It's fine to die for a good reason.

524
00:47:30,601 --> 00:47:32,436
I can stop the needles from going further,

525
00:47:32,561 --> 00:47:33,896
but I can't get them out.

526
00:47:36,064 --> 00:47:37,816
Okay, I'll use the time you bought me

527
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,943
to get the babies back.

528
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:41,528
If we succeed,

529
00:47:41,653 --> 00:47:42,946
we must get Chan Sum to help us.

530
00:47:43,071 --> 00:47:43,989
The Invisible Woman?

531
00:47:44,156 --> 00:47:46,617
Yes. Before I find her, we must be careful.

532
00:47:46,783 --> 00:47:48,368
That monster discovered me

533
00:47:48,577 --> 00:47:52,247
when I sneaked into his cave last time.

534
00:47:52,456 --> 00:47:53,540
He thought it was you.

535
00:47:53,749 --> 00:47:55,709
So he is sending Chan Gau to kill you now.

536
00:48:14,436 --> 00:48:16,063
<i>Officer Lau, a madman is holding hostage</i>

537
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:17,689
<i>dozens of people in the station</i>

538
00:48:17,856 --> 00:48:19,274
<i>and destroyed the station's computer system.</i>

539
00:48:19,441 --> 00:48:20,817
<i>A cargo train is charging</i>

540
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:22,319
<i>toward the station now.</i>

541
00:48:22,611 --> 00:48:24,112
When will it hit the station?

542
00:48:24,238 --> 00:48:25,322
<i>In about five minutes.</i>

543
00:48:25,614 --> 00:48:26,240
Got it.

544
00:48:46,218 --> 00:48:47,302
All units, get ready!

545
00:48:54,977 --> 00:48:56,144
Be careful of the land mines!

546
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:00,023
Don't step on them!

547
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:05,612
Don't move!

548
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:10,158
Be careful! There are land mines!

549
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,420
Watch out! Go now!

550
00:49:21,587 --> 00:49:23,630
The train will crash in one minute.

551
00:49:23,797 --> 00:49:25,007
Go in there!

552
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:26,967
Save the hostages inside first.

553
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:34,349
Why aren't you going in?

554
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:02,336
Run!

555
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:34,409
Brace yourself!

556
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:38,580
Leave it to me!

557
00:51:17,286 --> 00:51:18,662
Run!

558
00:51:18,829 --> 00:51:20,914
Sir, how can we stop the train?

559
00:51:21,081 --> 00:51:22,833
The madman has destroyed the computer!

560
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:24,501
It can't be stopped. Go quickly!

561
00:51:37,598 --> 00:51:40,309
Run! The train is here!

562
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:12,341
Take it!

563
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:19,848
Let's go!

564
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:00,722
Dear.

565
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:07,855
What did the doctor say?

566
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:12,693
If you're lucky, you can walk in six months.

567
00:53:12,985 --> 00:53:14,361
Otherwise?

568
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,866
Otherwise,

569
00:53:20,742 --> 00:53:22,452
you may become a cripple.

570
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:27,416
Cheer up.

571
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:30,169
As Wonder Woman's husband,

572
00:53:30,335 --> 00:53:33,005
I'll always stand by you.

573
00:53:33,922 --> 00:53:35,799
When did you find out?

574
00:53:36,466 --> 00:53:38,510
At the station,

575
00:53:39,595 --> 00:53:44,099
when you looked at me, unwilling to go in.

576
00:53:49,438 --> 00:53:53,150
No more secret smiles from now on

577
00:53:54,776 --> 00:53:56,820
and no more secret tears.

578
00:53:57,571 --> 00:54:00,949
Just tell me everything.

579
00:54:08,624 --> 00:54:09,833
Okay?

580
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:16,048
Dear.

581
00:54:55,045 --> 00:54:55,963
Hey! There's a flower bud--

582
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:08,767
What's wrong? Sit down first.

583
00:55:08,976 --> 00:55:12,145
No, I just got a clue.

584
00:55:12,646 --> 00:55:14,398
I must write it down now!

585
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:16,024
Sit down first.

586
00:55:16,275 --> 00:55:17,818
Leave now!

587
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,625
How long have you known about it?

588
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:36,253
I've always known about it.

589
00:55:37,462 --> 00:55:40,007
In the process,

590
00:55:40,215 --> 00:55:43,343
I found that the invisible robe emits toxins.

591
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:46,471
That's why I always tell you to stay out of here.

592
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,267
But a flower bud has grown.

593
00:55:50,434 --> 00:55:54,730
I'll be okay if the flowers can be saved.

594
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:57,065
Come on, get out of here.

595
00:55:57,232 --> 00:56:01,195
We are partners. How can I leave you like this?

596
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,366
Where are my glasses?

597
00:56:06,658 --> 00:56:07,951
You're wearing them.

598
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,296
Before the robe is finished,

599
00:56:19,546 --> 00:56:20,923
I will not die.

600
00:56:23,258 --> 00:56:26,136
I can still smell the fragrance in your hair.

601
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:51,537
（别哭）

602
00:56:56,792 --> 00:56:59,294
Let's look at the flowers outside.

603
00:57:10,013 --> 00:57:11,598
I'll be fine.

604
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:13,267
Get out of here!

605
00:57:19,898 --> 00:57:23,694
Let me in!

606
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:28,532
I won't go out even if you can get in.

607
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:36,665
The robe will be ready when the flowers bloom.

608
00:57:36,874 --> 00:57:39,501
You promised to take care of them until then.

609
00:57:39,626 --> 00:57:41,545
Have you forgotten about that?

610
00:57:53,056 --> 00:57:54,057
Chan Sum.

611
00:57:55,184 --> 00:57:57,477
Why are you still meeting that monster?

612
00:57:57,853 --> 00:57:59,980
He won't let the professor live anyway.

613
00:58:00,189 --> 00:58:02,733
He'll kill him once the robe is finished!

614
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,526
How many needles were you attacked with?

615
00:58:06,945 --> 00:58:08,906
If you help us,

616
00:58:09,364 --> 00:58:11,283
Wonder Woman and I may stand a chance to kill him.

617
00:58:31,762 --> 00:58:32,846
If you fear death so much,

618
00:58:33,055 --> 00:58:35,015
how can you help Wonder Woman?

619
00:58:35,224 --> 00:58:36,725
I won't thank you.

620
00:58:36,892 --> 00:58:38,268
You saved my life.

621
00:58:38,477 --> 00:58:40,521
But to protect the professor,

622
00:58:40,687 --> 00:58:41,813
you let that monster control you.

623
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:44,274
You have harmed so many babies.

624
00:58:45,067 --> 00:58:47,694
You can deceive others but not yourself.

625
00:58:48,153 --> 00:58:49,863
Wonder Woman can help you now.

626
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:52,157
I'll see you at the same spot tomorrow.

627
00:58:52,282 --> 00:58:53,534
I'll wait until you come!

628
00:58:57,246 --> 00:58:58,372
You'd better come.

629
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,258
I don't have time. Please hurry.

630
00:59:14,054 --> 00:59:15,013
I did it!

631
00:59:17,266 --> 00:59:20,352
Sum-ching! Sum-ching!

632
00:59:29,945 --> 00:59:31,029
Lucky star.

633
00:59:31,822 --> 00:59:34,324
Sum-ching, the invisible robe is finally finished.

634
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:44,084
Why haven't you gotten that robe?

635
00:59:44,293 --> 00:59:48,130
It can't work under the sun yet.

636
00:59:48,338 --> 00:59:50,674
The strength of the Emperor's army will be reduced.

637
00:59:50,841 --> 00:59:53,594
It'll soon be finished.

638
00:59:53,886 --> 00:59:56,805
Give the professor a few more days.

639
00:59:56,972 --> 01:00:00,601
Get it no matter what

640
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:03,228
before sunset tomorrow.

641
01:00:03,353 --> 01:00:06,148
Chan Gau will help you then.

642
01:00:06,607 --> 01:00:10,402
Master, all my work in your great plan

643
01:00:10,527 --> 01:00:11,987
are inconsequential.

644
01:00:12,112 --> 01:00:16,783
If I find an emperor among those babies,

645
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:19,828
you'll be honored for your services.

646
01:00:30,005 --> 01:00:33,050
All princes should be asleep.

647
01:00:33,258 --> 01:00:35,469
You should go to sleep too.

648
01:00:45,521 --> 01:00:47,356
September 18th.

649
01:00:49,525 --> 01:00:50,901
Today,

650
01:00:52,027 --> 01:00:52,945
I've finally solved the UV light problem.

651
01:00:53,153 --> 01:00:56,031
But I've also reached the end of my life too.

652
01:01:01,537 --> 01:01:04,206
<i>From the first day when I started working on the invisible robe,</i>

653
01:01:04,665 --> 01:01:07,334
<i>I knew I would die from the toxins.</i>

654
01:01:08,252 --> 01:01:11,004
<i>Without Sum-ching,</i>

655
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:14,675
<i>I wouldn't have been able to face it.</i>

656
01:01:14,842 --> 01:01:17,594
<i>If she knows that my only hope now</i>

657
01:01:18,387 --> 01:01:22,724
<i>is to take her hands</i>

658
01:01:22,933 --> 01:01:24,977
<i>and witness the flowers bloom,</i>

659
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:27,521
<i>will she still kill me?</i>

660
01:01:28,188 --> 01:01:31,400
The day has come.

661
01:01:32,401 --> 01:01:39,575
Regardless of the progress,

662
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:42,703
get the invisible robe

663
01:01:44,663 --> 01:01:49,209
and kill the professor.

664
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:07,269
Professor, I'll never return to you.

665
01:02:07,561 --> 01:02:10,731
<i>I won't leave until I see you.</i>

666
01:02:10,939 --> 01:02:12,232
Believe me.

667
01:02:13,192 --> 01:02:14,943
You are in great danger.

668
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:16,778
Leave the lab now.

669
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:22,576
Damn it!

670
01:02:22,784 --> 01:02:24,536
Even Wonder Woman is late.

671
01:02:24,745 --> 01:02:28,248
I shouldn't have promised to come.

672
01:02:28,582 --> 01:02:30,042
Should I leave or not?

673
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:43,388
Great. There you are.

674
01:02:43,597 --> 01:02:45,599
Master sent me to kill you.

675
01:02:47,351 --> 01:02:48,810
Wait, Chan Sum.

676
01:02:48,977 --> 01:02:51,939
I won't let you go this time.

677
01:02:52,231 --> 01:02:54,066
Can you really do it?

678
01:02:54,316 --> 01:02:56,610
I must execute Master's order.

679
01:02:56,944 --> 01:02:58,403
But I can promise you

680
01:02:58,612 --> 01:03:00,614
that I'll do you a favor after you die.

681
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:03,033
Wait, it might be you who'll die.

682
01:03:03,283 --> 01:03:04,201
也许是你

683
01:03:04,409 --> 01:03:05,160
有什么未做完的事情

684
01:03:05,327 --> 01:03:07,037
Tell me your last wish. Tell me!

685
01:03:07,871 --> 01:03:08,997
Take care of the professor.

686
01:03:09,122 --> 01:03:10,040
The professor?

687
01:03:27,975 --> 01:03:29,393
Save the professor for me.

688
01:03:40,279 --> 01:03:41,780
Chan Sum, what are you doing?

689
01:03:41,947 --> 01:03:42,823
She didn't come to kill you.

690
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:44,366
She came to kill herself.

691
01:03:45,033 --> 01:03:46,660
You are giving up your life to save him?

692
01:03:46,827 --> 01:03:48,036
My life?

693
01:03:48,996 --> 01:03:51,790
I am just Master's killing machine.

694
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:53,709
A machine won't have feelings

695
01:03:53,876 --> 01:03:56,378
or sacrifice themselves for someone.

696
01:04:05,888 --> 01:04:07,389
Life is meaningful

697
01:04:07,556 --> 01:04:10,309
if you can face yourself.

698
01:04:10,517 --> 01:04:12,019
Not just myself,

699
01:04:12,227 --> 01:04:13,687
but I can't even face him!

700
01:04:13,896 --> 01:04:16,106
Chan Sum!

701
01:04:21,195 --> 01:04:22,696
So you're all leaving?

702
01:04:23,864 --> 01:04:25,866
Damn, can't you stay put?

703
01:04:26,074 --> 01:04:27,868
My own bike is better.

704
01:04:30,162 --> 01:04:31,330
Wait for me!

705
01:04:36,919 --> 01:04:38,003
Chan Sum!

706
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:40,255
You can change yourself from now on!

707
01:04:40,422 --> 01:04:42,257
So what? I'm still Chan Sum!

708
01:04:42,424 --> 01:04:44,426
You can be another Chan Chat!

709
01:04:44,593 --> 01:04:47,554
It's too late! Leave me alone!

710
01:04:52,809 --> 01:04:55,604
Shit! Even a bike can't catch up?

711
01:04:55,771 --> 01:04:56,522
Go!

712
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:03,570
You've shunned your past.

713
01:05:03,779 --> 01:05:05,489
This is your true self!

714
01:05:05,697 --> 01:05:07,115
I shouldn't live then!

715
01:05:10,953 --> 01:05:11,870
No!

716
01:05:25,509 --> 01:05:26,552
This is bad!

717
01:05:31,765 --> 01:05:33,475
You two are in great trouble!

718
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:35,936
So lucky. Brace yourselves!

719
01:05:51,702 --> 01:05:52,911
Tung-tung?

720
01:05:53,704 --> 01:05:55,122
Ching-ching?

721
01:05:55,789 --> 01:05:59,668
Let go of my hand or we'll both fall!

722
01:05:59,835 --> 01:06:00,794
No!

723
01:06:03,088 --> 01:06:04,798
Grab it!

724
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:10,596
I can't hold on any longer!

725
01:06:13,348 --> 01:06:14,474
I won't let go!

726
01:06:14,683 --> 01:06:15,976
We must be together.

727
01:06:17,644 --> 01:06:18,979
It's really you.

728
01:06:19,563 --> 01:06:21,231
You two knew each other?

729
01:06:25,152 --> 01:06:26,153
I don't remember.

730
01:06:26,361 --> 01:06:27,487
The past is trivial.

731
01:06:27,696 --> 01:06:30,240
What matters is the thing you wish to do now.

732
01:06:31,491 --> 01:06:34,161
Hey! What do you want to do?

733
01:06:35,662 --> 01:06:37,122
Master sent Chan Gau to kill the professor.

734
01:06:37,372 --> 01:06:38,749
I want to save him.

735
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:40,209
The professor?

736
01:07:11,865 --> 01:07:12,950
Give it to me.

737
01:07:43,605 --> 01:07:46,149
The invisible robe can withstand UV light now.

738
01:07:46,316 --> 01:07:47,860
Nobody can find it.

739
01:07:49,486 --> 01:07:51,071
No!

740
01:07:55,909 --> 01:08:00,956
Sum-ching. I have so much to tell you.

741
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:03,250
It's all inside the gift box.

742
01:08:17,514 --> 01:08:18,891
It doesn't matter how hard you hit him.

743
01:08:19,057 --> 01:08:20,767
He'll stick to what he wants.

744
01:08:21,143 --> 01:08:29,484
No! You can't give it to him.

745
01:08:29,735 --> 01:08:31,320
I have lost everything.

746
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:32,821
I can't let him die.

747
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:52,799
I'm sorry.

748
01:08:53,717 --> 01:08:56,720
I knew Master can't make you kill me.

749
01:09:14,446 --> 01:09:15,656
It won't be that easy!

750
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:25,165
Wait, hold on!

751
01:09:52,734 --> 01:09:55,237
Idiot, here's the tape.

752
01:09:55,612 --> 01:09:57,739
Come and get it!

753
01:10:06,373 --> 01:10:07,624
Goodbye!

754
01:10:09,543 --> 01:10:11,628
It's too hot here!

755
01:10:37,613 --> 01:10:41,033
Sum-ching, it's better to have it destroyed

756
01:10:41,283 --> 01:10:43,243
than to let him have it.

757
01:10:43,619 --> 01:10:44,912
Hey! Let's go!

758
01:10:51,376 --> 01:10:52,252
Go ahead.

759
01:10:52,711 --> 01:10:53,295
What about-

760
01:10:53,504 --> 01:10:54,796
Let her be.

761
01:10:56,256 --> 01:10:57,424
Where are we going?

762
01:10:57,674 --> 01:10:59,635
To save the babies from the cave.

763
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:03,180
Just the two of us? Let me get my stuff first.

764
01:11:06,642 --> 01:11:10,729
May I look at the blooming flowers?

765
01:11:55,649 --> 01:11:57,150
All the babies are here.

766
01:11:57,317 --> 01:11:58,694
Don't touch anything.

767
01:11:58,861 --> 01:12:01,572
The babies will die if we fight here.

768
01:12:24,052 --> 01:12:26,221
You damned monster, come on and die!

769
01:12:26,388 --> 01:12:28,640
Beware. This place is full of methane.

770
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:37,357
You damned monster like methane more than oxygen.

771
01:12:37,524 --> 01:12:38,567
I'll kill you.

772
01:12:43,155 --> 01:12:45,449
How dare you come here!

773
01:12:45,574 --> 01:12:46,700
Attack her!

774
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:51,038
Special powers?

775
01:13:09,306 --> 01:13:10,265
You are kneeling to him now? Weren't you bold before?

776
01:13:10,432 --> 01:13:11,892
I can't help it.

777
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:14,269
My legs feel like jelly.

778
01:13:14,436 --> 01:13:15,771
Do you think someone like you can beat me?

779
01:13:16,021 --> 01:13:18,732
It's no use kneeling to me. Guards, go!

780
01:13:18,899 --> 01:13:22,027
-Yes! -Yes!

781
01:13:22,694 --> 01:13:23,987
We have no way out now.

782
01:13:24,154 --> 01:13:26,406
Deal with Master, I'll handle the others.

783
01:13:26,615 --> 01:13:27,991
Go!

784
01:14:06,864 --> 01:14:10,075
It's an honor to die by my hands.

785
01:14:10,492 --> 01:14:12,911
Damn it. I think I'm high on methane.

786
01:14:13,078 --> 01:14:14,830
What should we do? We can't beat him.

787
01:14:14,913 --> 01:14:16,748
Don't let him concentrate. Go!

788
01:14:17,374 --> 01:14:19,376
I'll kill you this time.

789
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:41,815
Tung-tung, go with Chan Chat!

790
01:14:42,024 --> 01:14:43,233
No, I'll fight until the end!

791
01:14:43,358 --> 01:14:44,151
No!

792
01:14:45,402 --> 01:14:47,029
You'll be poisoned if you stay.

793
01:14:56,455 --> 01:14:58,123
Let's go!

794
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:23,106
I'll need some oxygen.

795
01:15:48,966 --> 01:15:51,552
Go to hell, all of you!

796
01:15:54,137 --> 01:15:55,931
He must have been blown up to pieces this time.

797
01:15:56,056 --> 01:15:57,099
Why is this one so late? He's still alive!

798
01:16:17,411 --> 01:16:18,370
Damn you!

799
01:16:24,376 --> 01:16:25,502
He's afraid of lights.

800
01:16:25,794 --> 01:16:26,920
Give me some more.

801
01:17:22,935 --> 01:17:26,855
Is my face still pretty?

802
01:17:28,065 --> 01:17:30,234
What?

803
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:31,318
I don't know if you're fine or not,

804
01:17:31,485 --> 01:17:33,195
but you scared me to death!

805
01:17:49,878 --> 01:17:51,171
He's still alive?

806
01:18:17,573 --> 01:18:18,740
How is this possible?

807
01:18:18,907 --> 01:18:20,200
We destroyed his body,

808
01:18:20,409 --> 01:18:22,369
but his mind is still there.

809
01:18:47,394 --> 01:18:49,229
He has gained control over me!

810
01:18:49,938 --> 01:18:51,190
Let me help you.

811
01:18:51,356 --> 01:18:52,649
Don't come near me!

812
01:18:57,905 --> 01:18:59,573
I can't control myself!

813
01:19:04,244 --> 01:19:06,997
Go. Quick!

814
01:19:07,414 --> 01:19:09,124
Go with Chan Chat!

815
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:38,737
What should we do?

816
01:19:38,904 --> 01:19:39,780
Go!

817
01:19:56,755 --> 01:19:58,131
Ching-ching!

818
01:19:58,298 --> 01:20:00,467
Don't let me do it again!

819
01:20:00,843 --> 01:20:03,554
Fuck you!

820
01:20:03,762 --> 01:20:06,473
Die!

821
01:20:07,266 --> 01:20:08,767
Go!

822
01:20:11,228 --> 01:20:12,813
You son of a bitch!

823
01:20:32,082 --> 01:20:34,042
He's controlling my body, go!

824
01:20:34,209 --> 01:20:36,044
We won't leave you behind!

825
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:38,589
I'm happy to have met you again!

826
01:20:40,632 --> 01:20:42,050
I'm sorry!

827
01:20:42,676 --> 01:20:44,553
Chan Sum!

828
01:20:48,265 --> 01:20:49,725
-Chan Sum! -Ching-ching!

829
01:20:49,933 --> 01:20:53,520
I'll die with you, damned monster!

830
01:20:53,687 --> 01:20:59,735
<i>China must have an emperor.</i>

831
01:21:07,451 --> 01:21:09,494
<i>China must have an emperor.</i>

832
01:21:09,703 --> 01:21:18,003
<i>What's important is today, not the past.</i>

833
01:21:19,588 --> 01:21:26,386
<i>Can we see the blooming flowers together?</i>

834
01:21:26,553 --> 01:21:29,389
Professor!

835
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:58,085
Ching-ching.

836
01:22:00,587 --> 01:22:02,130
You won't die.

837
01:22:06,176 --> 01:22:07,928
Hey! Get on the ground before you talk.

838
01:22:08,136 --> 01:22:09,972
Otherwise, I'll die!

839
01:22:18,313 --> 01:22:19,773
Are you okay?

840
01:22:20,858 --> 01:22:22,150
Where's Chan Chat?

841
01:22:23,193 --> 01:22:25,529
I got something good!

842
01:22:25,696 --> 01:22:28,448
Take one, or when the press comes,

843
01:22:28,615 --> 01:22:31,159
we'll look shabby!

844
01:22:31,451 --> 01:22:33,453
Come on, put them on!

845
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,070
<i>The police have solved</i>

846
01:23:07,196 --> 01:23:09,031
<i>the missing babies case.</i>

847
01:23:09,281 --> 01:23:12,492
<i>Most of the missing babies have been found.</i>

848
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:15,245
<i>Here's our live report.</i>

849
01:23:15,412 --> 01:23:16,580
<i>We heard that</i>

850
01:23:16,914 --> 01:23:18,290
<i>three unknown heroines solved it.</i>

851
01:23:18,457 --> 01:23:21,043
<i>How are they related to the police?</i>

852
01:23:21,210 --> 01:23:23,712
<i>They are close friends of the police.</i>

853
01:23:23,879 --> 01:23:25,297
<i>Who are they?</i>

854
01:23:25,422 --> 01:23:26,256
<i>No comment.</i>

855
01:23:26,381 --> 01:23:29,176
<i>When will they come again?</i>

856
01:23:29,384 --> 01:23:31,386
<i>When we need them.</i>

857
01:23:31,595 --> 01:23:33,889
<i>Do you know their names?</i>

858
01:23:34,431 --> 01:23:36,850
<i>-Their names? -Yes, their names.</i>

859
01:23:37,059 --> 01:23:39,102
<i>They are called The Heroic Trio.</i>

860
01:23:40,103 --> 01:23:41,647
<i>-The Heroic Trio? -The Heroic Trio?</i>

861
01:23:41,855 --> 01:23:42,689
When did we get that name?

862
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:43,565
<i>-How do you know that?</i>

863
01:23:43,732 --> 01:23:45,734
-Where does the name come from? <i>-It's top-secret, I'm sorry.</i>

864
01:23:45,901 --> 01:23:47,194
I was just improvising it a bit.
