1
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,835
轰动本市的婴儿失踪案
<i>The city is shocked by missing baby cases.</i>

2
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:11,548
到目前为止 三个月内已经增至18名
<i>Eighteen babies were taken in the past three months.</i>

3
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,510
警方仍然未有任何突破性发现
<i>The police have made no breakthrough</i>

4
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:15,969
束手无策
<i>and the investigations have reached the bottleneck.</i>

5
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,555
本台记者经警务署长…
<i>-The Commissioner of Police…</i> -All my clients have good lives.

6
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,642
一下子便到了！请停车
Here we are. Stop!

7
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:23,602
我跳
I'm coming!

8
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,146
有点麻烦
Something is wrong.

9
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,150
中招了
Damn it.

10
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,652
不管那么多了
Forget it.

11
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,695
小心小心
Be careful.

12
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:37,866
看…极具格调的建筑
Look! It's a stylish building!

13
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,451
请进内参观一下
Let's take a look inside.

14
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,746
两位请跟我过来
This way, please.

15
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,667
这一幢屋格调幽雅
This way. This house is elegant

16
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:50,712
保管一千米内了无人烟
and there is no one else here within 1 km.

17
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:54,174
开车去买菜 车程只要五分钟
It's only a five-minute ride to the market.

18
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:57,052
这么多优点 总会有些缺点吧
This house can't be that perfect. Surely there must be some defects.

19
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,387
当然有点点缺点的
There is a little defect,

20
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:00,097
但影响不大
but it won't be a problem.

21
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,431
跟我来
This way.

22
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,018
这房子的缺点便是…
The defect is that

23
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,812
没什么装修
it's not really renovated.

24
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,568
这叫做没什么装修？
You call this as not really renovated?

25
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,861
没事的 结构没事
The structure is fine.

26
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,321
只不过一场小小的火灾
There was just a little fire.

27
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:19,324
老婆
-Honey. -Hush.

28
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,746
给你看点东西
I'll show you something.

29
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,003
鸟语花香
Nature!

30
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,010
保证你们越住越喜欢
You'll love this place in no time.

31
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,388
你觉得怎样？
What do you think?

32
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,724
去！早叫那无良业主
Damn it. I've asked the owner

33
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,100
把房子修葺好才拿出来卖
to renovate the house first.

34
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:46,935
徒浪费我的时间
What a waste of time!

35
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,440
我运气好
How lucky!

36
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,276
现在那个笨蛋会买这个房子呢？
Who the hell would buy it now?

37
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,694
气死我
Damn it!

38
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:56,403
走吧…
Let's go.

39
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,905
别动
Don't move!

40
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,450
老公呀！买下吧 我喜欢这房子
Dear, let's buy it.

41
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:02,701
它很有性格
I like it.

42
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,203
性格？
It has character.

43
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:05,787
是吗？
Character?

44
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,581
你知道我喜欢我们的房子是怎样的
-Really? -You know how I like it.

45
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:08,665
我知道
I know.

46
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,293
那就 先下点订金吧
Pay the deposit first then.

47
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,461
别吵
Quiet!

48
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:34,900
偷车？自己搞定
Did you try to steal my car? Put this on yourself.

49
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:38,570
是…我自己搞定
Okay, I'll put it on myself.

50
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,989
真厉害
Incredible!

51
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,618
当然啦！我老公是个警察哩
Of course. My husband is a policeman.

52
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,454
快吧
Keep walking.

53
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,497
我在走呀
Aren't I walking now?

54
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:50,123
至今天为止
<i>Up until today,</i>

55
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:53,001
这两个月有18名婴儿失踪
18 babies went missing in the past two months.

56
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,713
由犯案手法看来 是同一人做的
They seem like the work of one person.

57
00:04:56,922 --> 00:05:00,175
到目前为止 所有失踪婴儿家人
None of the missing babies' families

58
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,885
都没收到任何勒索信
has received any blackmail letters so far.

59
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,513
亦没任何政治或恐怖组织
Nor has any political or terrorist group

60
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,514
承认是他们干的
claimed responsibility.

61
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,599
局长 这案件离奇古怪
Chief, this is bizarre.

62
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,686
你认为我们应否与女飞侠联络呢
Shall we approach Wonder Woman?

63
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:14,314
虽然好几次她也主动来帮我们
Even though she helped us before,

64
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,942
但我们连她是什么人也不知道
we still don't know who she is.

65
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,444
根本没办法去联络她
We can't reach her at all.

66
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,947
由失踪的均是男婴这点看来
All missing babies are boys.

67
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:25,993
我相信他们并不是有什么勒索要求
This shows that it's not blackmailing.

68
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,036
喂…
Hey…

69
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,163
可能是与邪教有关系
Maybe it has something to do with cults.

70
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,269
见到有人在会议室冲出来吗？
Did anyone rush out of the conference room?

71
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:53,228
没有
No.

72
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,939
局长
Chief!

73
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:04,239
（下一个将会是你的儿子）

74
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,088
跟我来
Come with me.

75
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:27,137
婴儿房在楼上 那边是手术室
The babies' ward is upstairs. Operation rooms are over there.

76
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:30,933
我好担心我们的儿子呀！
I'm worried about our son.

77
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,060
我们不如立刻把他带回家吧！
Let's take him home now.

78
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,269
阿刘
Lau!

79
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,188
儿子今早才出世 如果现在带回去
He was just born this morning.

80
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,481
医生说不负责的
The doctor won't take the risk if we discharge him now.

81
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:38,190
阿刘…
Lau--

82
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,608
算了！留下吧
Fine! We'll leave him here.

83
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,402
既然如此 为何不叫女飞侠来帮忙？
Why didn't you call Wonder Woman for help?

84
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,072
局长太太 我也没办法找到她
Ma'am, we have no way to contact her.

85
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,241
况且我已多派了很多人手
I've sent more men here.

86
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:47,991
如果有事
Staying here

87
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,244
那婴儿在家或医院也没分别
is just as safe as staying at home.

88
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:53,413
快点看着我老婆
Take care of her!

89
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:54,748
是 局长
Okay.

90
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,500
局长 刘Sir 南区刚有辆巴士失事
Chief, Officer Lau, there's a bus crash in the Southern District just now.

91
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,377
院长说可能要用这一边的病床
The warden might need these beds,

92
00:06:58,544 --> 00:06:59,753
叫我们商量一下
so we need to think about it.

93
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:02,130
阿刘你先出去
Lau. You may leave first.

94
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:09,972
阿刘他们的目标只是对付我儿子
Lau. It's my son that they are after.

95
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,975
你说可不可以用别的…
How about we find someone

96
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,434
换一换呢？
to swap with my son?

97
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,894
找谁的儿子？
Whose son?

98
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:18,480
那确是很缺德的…
I guess that's immoral.

99
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,065
况且他们要抓的是你儿子
They want your son.

100
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,942
你怎么换 他们也找到的
They will find him eventually.

101
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:26,363
是…如果被人知道…很难为情
Yes, it'd be embarrassing if others knew.

102
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:28,532
无论如何也要撑一去
Let's brace ourselves.

103
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,619
撑…
Brace ourselves.…

104
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,538
局长太太 对不起
I'm sorry, ma'am.

105
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:35,789
刘Sir吩咐没他命令
Officer Lau said no one can enter

106
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,165
任何人不能进去
without his permission.

107
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,333
算了
Forget it! Look up there!

108
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,502
什么事？
What's wrong?

109
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,213
有婴儿掉下来呀
The babies are falling down!

110
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,090
接住他们！接住他们
-Catch them! -Catch them!

111
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,592
我的儿子呀
-My son! -My son!

112
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,135
接住儿子呀
Catch our son!

113
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:31,887
那个才是我们的儿子呀？
Which one is our son?

114
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,555
随便一个吧
Either one of them can be him!

115
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,432
那个才是呀？
Which one?

116
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:04,711
女飞侠呀
Wonder Woman!

117
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,966
女飞侠啊
-Wonder Woman! -Wonder Woman!

118
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,644
下来了
She's coming down!

119
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,906
她的血留在上面 你拿去化验吧
There's some blood on the wall. Run some tests on it.

120
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,712
不是我们的
This is not our baby. This is not our baby!

121
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:32,090
对！是个女的
It's a girl!

122
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:35,511
女的？是我的女儿呀
-A girl? It's my daughter! -Hey!

123
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:39,431
没事就好了！吓死我了…
I'm so glad you are fine. -I was so scared. -This is bad.

124
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,808
找人上去把血抹掉拿去化验
Get someone to collect the blood sample.

125
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:43,810
是 刘Sir！跟我来
-Yes, sir. Come with me. -Okay.

126
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,111
东东 医院里又有个婴儿失踪了
-Hello? <i>-Tung-tung, another baby is missing.</i>

127
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,030
我有很多事要做 要很夜才回来
<i>I'll be back late tonight.</i>

128
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,240
好的
Okay.

129
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:57,824
你不开心？
<i>Are you upset?</i>

130
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,410
不是！你用心办事吧
No. Work hard tonight. <i>-Goodbye.</i> -Goodbye.

131
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,547
这么喜欢打！下次把你的头都劈下来
You always like to fight. I'll chop off your head next time.

132
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:36,798
快守着门口
Guard the door!

133
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,976
公公 你要的童子 我已带回来了
Master, here is the baby boy you want.

134
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:11,875
你替我把十九阿哥抱进去
Take the 19th prince inside

135
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,795
跟其他皇阿哥一起休息
to rest with the other princes.

136
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,088
是 公公
Yes, Master.

137
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:17,881
阿三
Sum.

138
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:23,804
你的心跳得太快了
Your heart is beating too fast.

139
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,097
我没有
No, it's not.

140
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:28,934
你是不需要有记忆
Memories do you no good,

141
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:31,937
更不可以有感情
neither do feelings or emotions.

142
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:33,063
我没有
I don't have any.

143
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:37,192
等下一个黄道吉日到来
I'll wait for the next auspicious day.

144
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:41,113
我会在他们当中
Among all the babies,

145
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:44,992
选一个做皇帝
I'll choose one to be the emperor.

146
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,207
中国是不可以没皇帝的
China must have an emperor.

147
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:56,128
中国是不可以没皇帝的
China must have an emperor.

148
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:59,548
中国是不可以没皇帝的
China must have an emperor.

149
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,319
一就是你自己爬上来
China must have an emperor.

150
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,906
一就是你掉下去！没有人可以帮到你
Either you climb up by yourself or you will fall! No one can help you.

151
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,240
爬吧！
Climb up!

152
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:29,369
青青 爬吧！爬呀
Ching-ching, climb up!

153
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:36,084
不要掉下去 爬吧
Don't fall! Climb!

154
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:32,975
你又做梦了？
Did you have a nightmare again?

155
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:35,811
我可不可以进来？
May I come in?

156
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:37,437
仪器开动了
I'm working.

157
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:40,357
你知我不想有人进来影响我
You know I don't want anyone to disturb me.

158
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:44,862
这几年 我每晚都梦见那件隐形衣
I've been dreaming of the invisible robe every night for years.

159
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:48,866
昨晚我还见到它在阳光下隐形了
Last night, I dreamt that it was finally completed.

160
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,577
那衣服是否一直锁在保险库？
Has it always been kept in the safe?

161
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,704
是！有什么事吗？
Yes, why?

162
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:56,665
没有 警方今天打电话来
The police called today

163
00:15:56,748 --> 00:16:00,961
问我人怎样才可隐形 叫我发表意见
and asked me how one can be invisible.

164
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,967
在隐形衣未完成之前
Before the invisible robe is finished,

165
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,844
你是不想让人知道的
you don't want others to know about it.

166
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:12,931
就算完成了 我也不想被人知道
Even if it's finished, I want to keep it a secret forever

167
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,600
因为这类发明
because an invention like this

168
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,686
好容易被人利用来作战争武器的
may easily be used as a war weapon.

169
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:19,813
那么你研究这隐形衣
Then why are you still working on it?

170
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:21,023
对你有什么意义？
What does it mean to you?

171
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,984
当我专心去研究一样东西时
I feel the happiest

172
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,653
就是我最开心的时候
when I'm glued to my work.

173
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,239
你不怕我偷了那隐形衣？
Don't you worry that I'd steal it?

174
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:30,657
不怕
No.

175
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,868
一个人怎会偷自己的东西呢？
You can't steal what's already yours.

176
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:36,622
要不要咖啡？
Do you want some coffee?

177
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,123
好呀
Yes, please.

178
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:43,730
小姐呀 你给我那十八个童子的
Miss, the dates of birth

179
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:45,399
生辰八字…
of those 18 babies…

180
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:46,942
是否有关联的？
Are they related in any way?

181
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,610
奇怪了
It's strange.

182
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,947
他们个个都是紫微入宫 左辅右弼
They all have a royal destiny.

183
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:53,866
全部都是皇帝命啊
They are all fated to be emperors!

184
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,200
皇帝？
Emperors?

185
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,244
谁人会抓那么多属皇帝命的孩子呢？
Why would anyone kidnap so many little emperors?

186
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:02,791
妹妹
My sister!

187
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:37,826
是不是想吃？想吃便过来吧
Do you want some? Come over then.

188
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:51,632
来！来
Come. Come.

189
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:00,682
你跟我说话吗？
Are you talking to me?

190
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,812
没有呀
No.

191
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:19,493
姐姐 我可不可以吻你一下？
<i>May I kiss you?</i>

192
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,334
笑什么？
Why are you smiling?

193
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:29,586
笑？我没什么呀
Am I? It's nothing.

194
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,095
青田化工
Go down!

195
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,520
下来…
Stand on one side!

196
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,897
下来
-Stand together! Quickly! -Quickly!

197
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,446
那么糟糕！阿刘 他们是什么人呀？
Gosh! Who are they, Lau?

198
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:58,240
有三个持械行劫的积犯
Three armed robbers with criminal records

199
00:19:58,448 --> 00:19:59,700
刚打劫了解款车
just robbed a cash escort car

200
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,618
被我们的兄弟追到化工厂这里来
and were chased here by our men.

201
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:02,578
里面有八个人质
There are eight hostages inside

202
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,454
两个是解款车司机及守卫
including drivers and guards.

203
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:05,747
现在怎么办？
What do we do now?

204
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:06,832
我们现在迫他们出来
We will force them out.

205
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:07,875
给我一件
Give me one!

206
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:14,798
准备
Get ready!

207
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:16,175
放
Fire!

208
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:23,891
不用怕 是催泪弹而已 戴口罩
-Calm down, it's tear gas. Wear masks! -Wear masks!

209
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:28,395
出去
Get out!

210
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:31,106
去你的！出去
Damn! Get out!

211
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,610
枪呀
Quickly!

212
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:40,741
不准开枪
Give me the revolver!

213
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:42,201
你们全都听着
-Don't fire! -Listen up!

214
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:44,286
除了她外 里面还有很多人质

限你两小时内给我们一架直升机离去

216
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:49,750
不然我每五分钟杀一个人
or I'll kill one hostage every five minutes!

217
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:15,776
各位阿Sir 各位早安
Hello, sirs!

218
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,237
她是谁？
Who is she?

219
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:20,072
职业枪手陈七呀
A professional gunner, Chan Chat.

220
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:22,199
阿Sir 别这样子说我嘛
Sir, don't call me that.

221
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:24,326
我只杀该死的贱人而已
I only kill those who deserve to die.

222
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:25,953
你叫我捕头吧
Call me Thief Catcher.

223
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,038
我们警方不会花钱请你这种人的
The police won't hire you.

224
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:29,414
花钱？
Hire?

225
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:33,001
阿Sir 这次我吃亏点 便宜你
Sir, I'll do you a favor this time.

226
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:34,461
是免费的
It's free of charge.

227
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:20,799
抓住他
-Get them! -Yes, sir!

228
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,598
我投降了别开枪呀
I surrender! Don't fire! I surrender! Don't…

229
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:31,143
我投降了！不要…
Rescue the hostages! -Rescue the hostages. -Let's go.

230
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,603
快去救人质
-Rescue the hostages. -Come on!

231
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:40,110
伏下…
Lie down!

232
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,537
进去看还有没有人
Go and see if there are still hostages inside!

233
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,259
我结了婚的
I'm married.

234
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:05,385
去
So?

235
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:07,137
看来这事
It seems like

236
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:09,348
只有我才有本事替你找回儿子
only I can get your son back.

237
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:12,226
找回来是活生生的 收五十万
Pay me 500,000 if he's alive

238
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:14,853
死了你也不嫌弃 收十五万
and 150,000 if you don't mind he's dead.

239
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,647
我只收黄金 我的电话号码呀
I only take gold. Here's my number.

240
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:18,273
考虑清楚便打电话给我吧
Call me after you've thought about it.

241
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:02,985
报馆被人利用了
The newspaper has been used.

242
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:04,903
登报纸的根本不是来抓婴儿的
The one who placed the advertisement is

243
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:05,863
叫兄弟们们小心看着
not here for the babies. Warn the others.

244
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:06,613
是 刘Sir
Yes, sir.

245
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:08,282
刘太 你可以过去
Mrs. Lau, you may go.

246
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:11,410
请给我看看证件
Please show me your pass.

247
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,624
你今晚来干什么
What brings you here tonight?

248
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:18,709
我答应过护士长
I promised the head nurse

249
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:20,544
每星期一三五都来帮忙
to come and help every alternate day.

250
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:21,295
上面的老婆婆…
The old lady up there--

251
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,755
要见到你才肯做物理治疗！对吗？
Won't do physiotherapy without you.

252
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:25,257
你知就好了
So you know that already.

253
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:26,133
我要照顾那么多东西
I'm busy.

254
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:28,135
只怕照顾不了你呀
I can't take care of you.

255
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,011
小心点
Stay safe.

256
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:30,387
你也是
You too.

257
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12,179
你就是登报纸的那个人？
Are you the one who placed the advertisement?

258
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:13,597
你是不是警察？
Are you a cop?

259
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:18,894
告诉你 我今天晚上要杀掉所有婴儿
Listen. I'm going to kill all the babies tonight.

260
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,613
你干什么？
What are you doing?

261
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,992
不要…
No!

262
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:38,121
别过来 不然我杀了她
Don't move or I'll kill her!

263
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:39,623
你别乱来
Calm down.

264
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:41,375
放下！把那枝东西放下
Drop that!

265
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:42,709
不然我杀了她
Or I'll kill her!

266
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:44,211
你先放下
Drop that knife first!

267
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:45,587
我会杀了她的
I'll kill her!

268
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:47,381
好！我放
Okay! I'm dropping it!

269
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:49,800
进去里面呀
Go inside!

270
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:51,260
不然我杀了她
I'll kill her!

271
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:53,512
进去
Go inside!

272
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:55,597
他们把我儿子医死了
Those doctors killed my son.

273
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:57,099
我要那些婴儿陪葬
This is my revenge!

274
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:00,352
我要把婴儿杀光
-I'll kill all those babies! <i>-Dr. Wong.</i>

275
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:02,437
黄医生请到急诊室
<i>Please hurry to the emergency ward.</i>

276
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:04,940
黄医生请到急诊室
<i>Dr. Wong, please hurry to the emergency--</i>

277
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:08,193
我要把婴儿杀光
I'll kill all the babies!

278
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:12,155
你流血了！抹了它
You're bleeding! Wipe it off.

279
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:13,532
我没事
I'm fine.

280
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:19,371
你猜我们能可否撞开呢？
Hey. Do you think we can break down the door?

281
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:21,748
没可能！这门那么厚
No way, it's too thick.

282
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:24,084
让我试试
Let me try.

283
00:26:38,182 --> 00:26:39,892
那锁匙就在外面
The keys are just outside.

284
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:45,397
差一点点便可以摸到了
Just a bit more and I could get them!

285
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:46,899
你不用那么紧张呀
Calm down.

286
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:48,859
那疯子没那么快回来的
The madman won't be back so soon.

287
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,655
我担心那些小孩子而已
I'm only worried about the babies.

288
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:56,033
你没听到那疯子刚才说什么吗？
Didn't you hear what he said just now?

289
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:57,618
让我来
Let me try.

290
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:20,349
你还不走？
Why aren't you leaving?

291
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:37,866
收到了！你别紧张 慢慢说
Roger that.

292
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:41,203
只有一个人而已？
Stay calm, speak slowly.

293
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,037
是呀
-Just one person? -<i>Yes!</i>

294
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:46,291
这么迟！你新来的吗？
You are late! Are you new here?

295
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,386
带他出去
Take him out.

296
00:27:57,553 --> 00:27:58,428
是
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

297
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:01,765
别动！起来
Don't move! Get up!

298
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:04,476
我要把婴儿杀光…
-I'll kill all the babies! -Move!

299
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,229
老公
<i>Dear!</i> <i>Dear?</i>

300
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:09,982
我已经把那疯子制服了
I have captured the madman.

301
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:11,108
我知道
I know.

302
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,609
幸亏你及时通知我
Thank you for informing me on time.

303
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:13,485
我没有白来吧
I didn't come here for nothing.

304
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,444
走呀
Come here.

305
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:24,413
有没有奖品？
Any rewards?

306
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,414
没有
No!

307
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:28,834
老婆婆在上面等你呀 还不上去？
Don't keep the old lady waiting.

308
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:30,127
已经搅定了
It's done already.

309
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:38,427
你真顽皮！掩着嘴巴笑我？
Naughty! Are you laughing at me?

310
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:43,056
要不要等你一起走？
Are you leaving with me?

311
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,058
不用了！主角还没出场
No. The real one hasn't turned up yet.

312
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,101
什么？
What?

313
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,352
惊奇什么？
Why are you surprised?

314
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,648
你那么好管闲事！带你出去兜兜风
You're nosy. Let's go for a ride.

315
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:56,945
走了
Let's go!

316
00:28:59,198 --> 00:29:01,074
刘Sir 有人偷婴儿呀
Officer Lau, someone is kidnapping a baby.

317
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,756
不要开枪 那婴儿可能在里面的
Don't shoot! The baby might be in there!

318
00:29:20,302 --> 00:29:21,720
各位兄弟 不准开枪
Attention. Don't fire! Don't fire!

319
00:29:30,646 --> 00:29:31,772
走了
I'm leaving!

320
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:42,991
追
-Go after her! -Go after her!

321
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:45,786
女捕头？!
The Thief Catcher?

322
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:54,586
小三八 怎么张开了小嘴巴？
Hey, Nosy. What's with your mouth?

323
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:56,380
别睡呀 好戏还在后头
Don't sleep. More fun is coming.

324
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:58,173
这次好玩吗？
Isn't it fun?

325
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,805
还引不到你？追来吧
There you are. Follow me!

326
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:27,452
先睡一下
Let's take a rest first.

327
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:32,332
不是吧？这样也跟不到我？
I can't believe you still can't get me.

328
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:34,168
怎出来混呀？
What a shame.

329
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:48,640
无声无息这么阴险
Not even a noise? That's sinister!

330
00:30:49,725 --> 00:30:51,143
原来是个女人
So you're a woman!

331
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:53,020
原来是个婆娘
So you're a bitch!

332
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,620
告诉我 你为什么偷那么多婴儿？
Why did you kidnap all those babies?

333
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:12,623
你够了吧？干嘛掉转来说我…
What? You're blaming me for that?

334
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,209
看你站得那么刁钻…
You look pretty smart.

335
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:16,502
难道你就是那个女黑侠？
Are you that Wonder Woman?

336
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:17,836
你就是那个女捕头？
Are you the Thief Catcher?

337
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:19,796
知道的你便别碍着我发财
Don't get in my way then!

338
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:23,050
为了花红 你竟用婴儿做饵
How could you use a baby

339
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,343
引他们出来？
as your bait?

340
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,511
太卑鄙了
How despicable!

341
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:26,929
你够了吧
That's enough!

342
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:31,934
先把婴儿放下
Put the baby down first.

343
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:34,394
好！看你有没有本事
Let's see if you can make me do that!

344
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:07,761
刚才是热身 现在来真的
That was just a warm-up. Now, it's the real thing!

345
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:17,229
等一等…
Hey, wait!

346
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:26,613
搅什么鬼？
What's happening?

347
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:30,951
隐形人？
Invisible Woman?

348
00:32:33,996 --> 00:32:35,122
多了一个人？
There's one more person here?

349
00:32:58,353 --> 00:32:59,938
那个人好像是来帮我的
She seems to be on my side.

350
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:11,074
婴儿？
The baby!

351
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:21,001
小心呀
Be careful!

352
00:33:40,312 --> 00:33:42,189
那婴儿怎么了？
How's the baby? Hey!

353
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:46,068
等一等 你是谁呀？
Wait, who are you? Hey!

354
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:51,156
没事 没事了！乖呀
Everything's fine now.

355
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:07,005
够了吧 佛也会发火的
All right, don't test my patience!

356
00:34:07,172 --> 00:34:07,923
你是谁？
Who are you?

357
00:34:08,257 --> 00:34:09,258
陈七 走吧
Let's go, Chan Chat!

358
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,551
陈三 是你呀？
Chan Sum? It's you?

359
00:34:10,676 --> 00:34:11,593
走吧
Let's go!

360
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,221
别拉我 我自己走 不要呀
Don't pull me! I can walk on my own!

361
00:34:16,223 --> 00:34:16,974
局长 我怀疑今晚的事
Chief, I suspect the Thief Catcher you hired is the one

362
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:18,642
是你聘请的女捕头做
behind this incident today.

363
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:20,853
你怎知道的？
<i>How do you know?</i>

364
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:23,063
你叫她立刻把婴儿交回医院吧
Ask her to bring the baby back at once.

365
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:36,285
叫医生
Call the doctor.

366
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:40,998
那婴儿怎么了？
How's the baby?

367
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:41,707
把他救回
Save him.

368
00:34:41,832 --> 00:34:42,916
你放心
You can count on me.

369
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:44,793
推进急诊室去
To the emergency ward!

370
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:22,789
医生 怎么了？
Doctor, how's the baby?

371
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:26,460
对不起 太迟！救不到了
I'm sorry, it's too late. I couldn't save him.

372
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:11,255
通知他的家人
Call his parents.

373
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,548
知道了 刘Sir
Yes, sir.

374
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:18,846
青青 你别走呀
Ching-ching, don't go!

375
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:21,682
师父不会喜欢一个那么窝囊的徒儿
Our master hates idiots like me.

376
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:23,934
我舍不得你呀
I'll miss you.

377
00:36:24,101 --> 00:36:25,978
你自己照顾自己吧
Take care of yourself.

378
00:36:27,396 --> 00:36:28,647
别哭
Don't cry.

379
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:31,859
青青
Ching-ching!

380
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:33,151
不许追
Let her go!

381
00:36:35,904 --> 00:36:37,030
跪下
Kneel down.

382
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:41,618
东东你留在这里
Tung-tung. You must stay here

383
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:44,329
是要把我要你和师姐完成的使命
and fulfill the fate you and your martial sister

384
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:45,914
独力承担
shared alone.

385
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:48,458
将来为师父行侠仗义的责任
You're going to uphold justice for me

386
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:50,544
就由你一人承担
on your own.

387
00:37:07,144 --> 00:37:09,104
东东 你干嘛哭呀？
Tung-tung, why are you crying?

388
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:10,731
我没有
No, I'm not.

389
00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:14,109
到底为什么？
Tell me why.

390
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:16,069
真的没什么
It's nothing.

391
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:19,031
今天医院那案子怎么了？
How's the case today?

392
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:24,828
那失踪的婴儿 跌死了
The missing baby fell to his death.

393
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,801
十多年没见 你身手还挺好的
It has been ten years. You're still great.

394
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:42,471
那只老怪物从那里拿到那隐形衣？
Where did that monster get an invisible robe?

395
00:37:42,804 --> 00:37:44,640
婴儿这事也是他策动的
He's behind all this.

396
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:46,183
你还会插手吗？
Are you going to interfere?

397
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:47,976
谢谢你了
No, thank you.

398
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,771
当年在那地洞跑出来
When I escaped from that cave,

399
00:37:50,938 --> 00:37:53,065
多亏你捉到我也不杀我
you spared me even though you've already caught me.

400
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:55,442
现我很珍惜自己
Now I'm taking good care of myself.

401
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:57,945
那老怪物把那么多婴儿子抓走干嘛？
What does he want so many babies for?

402
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:01,281
等下次日全蚀 选其中一个做皇帝
He'll choose one to be the emperor in the next eclipse.

403
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:02,616
当不到皇帝的
And the rest

404
00:38:02,783 --> 00:38:04,409
就像你我一样 做他的杀手吗？
will become his killers like us?

405
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:06,912
不止 公公会把他们变成陈九
Moreover, Master would even turn them into Chan Gau.

406
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:09,540
陈三 不如你行行好
Chan Sum, do them a favor.

407
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:11,333
把婴儿们杀掉好了
Just kill the babies.

408
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:13,168
我被那怪物毒了三年
That monster has corrupted me for three years.

409
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:14,211
那次逃跑出来后
After I had escaped,

410
00:38:14,378 --> 00:38:15,045
我花了十年时间
I've spent ten years

411
00:38:15,337 --> 00:38:17,631
才能把自己当回一个人
to return to normal!

412
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:19,633
我不想那些婴儿全变成怪物
I don't want the babies to become monsters.

413
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,843
你可当作全不知情
Just pretend that you know nothing

414
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:22,219
别再插手
and leave them alone.

415
00:38:22,386 --> 00:38:23,971
不然公公命令一下
If Master gives the order,

416
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:25,389
我一样会杀你
I'd kill you as well.

417
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:27,266
要杀的现在杀
Do it then!

418
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:32,521
下次你躲不了
You won't be so lucky next time!

419
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:38,527
全告知我 我能当什么也不知吗？
Now that you've told me everything, how can I feign ignorance?

420
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:58,630
你不再是青青
You won't be called Ching-ching anymore.

421
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:01,633
从今天开始 你叫陈三
From now on, you are Chan Sum!

422
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:18,066
隐形衣十日之内务必要到手
<i>You must get the invisible robe in ten days</i>

423
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:20,736
事成之后 将博士杀之
<i>and kill the professor after that.</i>

424
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:23,155
若有失责 死路一条
<i>Do it or you'll die.</i>

425
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:24,489
（复制）
Hey, what are you doing?

426
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:35,334
你干什么？
I've told you many times.

427
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:45,928
我说过多次 这里很危险的 出去吧
It's dangerous here. Leave, please!

428
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:49,097
什么危险？你日夜在这儿都没事
What's so dangerous? You're always here.

429
00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:52,226
你总是不让我进来 你有什么隐瞒我
Are you keeping something from me?

430
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:57,105
你有什么不知道的？
You already know everything.

431
00:39:57,272 --> 00:39:59,066
你说隐形衣我也有份
You said the robe is mine too,

432
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:01,735
怎么隐形衣能见紫外光 我却不知道
but I didn't know it can stand UV light.

433
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:03,820
隐形衣还不能见紫外光
No, it still can't.

434
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:07,074
如果可以 你一定是第一个知道
You'll be the first one to know if it can.

435
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:09,993
那么这几天你在研究些什么？
What have you been working on these past few days then?

436
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:15,457
我在研究这个急诊室
I'm working on this Revival Box.

437
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:19,795
本来已经死掉
These were dead before,

438
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:22,256
但现在全部都救活了
but they are alive again.

439
00:40:27,386 --> 00:40:28,428
有没有花的？
Do they have any flowers?

440
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:31,014
有！一个月之后便有了
Yes. They will bloom in a month.

441
00:40:34,935 --> 00:40:36,395
心靖
Sum-ching.

442
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:41,567
你可以每天替我拿出去晒太阳吗？
Will you put them under the sun every day

443
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,277
晚上浇浇水
and water them at night?

444
00:40:45,654 --> 00:40:48,866
幸运星 是你教我折的
You taught me how to make these lucky stars.

445
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:50,450
你一定会见到花开的
You'll see them bloom.

446
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:00,085
十日内务必要将隐形衣到手
<i>You must get the invisible robe in ten days</i>

447
00:41:00,252 --> 00:41:02,713
事成之后将博士杀之
<i>and kill the professor after that.</i>

448
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,465
如有失责 死路一条
<i>Do it or you'll die.</i>

449
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:10,637
你下属很嚣张啊！关我两个多小时
Hey! Your men kept me for over two hours!

450
00:41:10,762 --> 00:41:12,639
这的确不关我事 是意外嘛
Don't blame me. It was an accident!

451
00:41:12,848 --> 00:41:13,473
意外？
Accident?

452
00:41:13,682 --> 00:41:15,017
如果不是你 那婴儿怎会死？
The baby died because of you!

453
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:15,976
你说什么呀？
What?

454
00:41:16,143 --> 00:41:17,311
是我推他下去吗？
I didn't drop him!

455
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:19,396
女飞侠窝囊救不到他而已
It's Wonder Woman's fault that she couldn't save him!

456
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:20,314
现在你可以走
You may go now,

457
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:22,649
不过 你骗到所有人骗不了你自己
but you can't deceive yourself.

458
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:27,946
够了吧！这个黑锅分明是你要我背的
Hey! Enough!

459
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:31,366
好 算我吃亏点 我尽管替你瞄一瞄
Stop making me the scapegoat!

460
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,829
姑娘 最重要是看看我的儿子
Fine, it's my loss. I'll keep an eye on it.

461
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,332
放心 我收你钱一定替你服务
Keep an extra eye on my son, miss.

462
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:39,374
谢谢
-Don't worry, I'll help my client. -Thank you!

463
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:41,168
这次真是自讨苦吃
I'm just asking for trouble!

464
00:42:05,192 --> 00:42:06,151
搅定
Done.

465
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:14,368
搅什么鬼呀！那么多鸟笼
Why are there so many birdcages?

466
00:42:36,974 --> 00:42:39,017
糟糕！惊动了老怪物
This is bad! That monster is here!

467
00:43:06,712 --> 00:43:10,424
喂！喂
Hey! Hey!

468
00:43:23,896 --> 00:43:25,314
怎么还是中招了
I still got hit!

469
00:43:33,113 --> 00:43:34,948
看你熬得多久
Let's see how long you can stand it.

470
00:43:37,326 --> 00:43:42,956
闯入魔宫的女人 你知是什么人吗？
Do you know who the intruder was?

471
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:43,999
不知道
No.

472
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:46,710
我想起了一个人
I have someone in mind,

473
00:43:46,877 --> 00:43:50,964
不过她应在十年前死了
but she should have died ten years ago.

474
00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:52,049
对
Yes.

475
00:43:52,216 --> 00:43:54,426
陈七是我亲手杀死
I killed Chan Chat myself.

476
00:43:54,593 --> 00:43:58,305
能够单枪匹马闯进来的 只有女飞侠
Now, only Wonder Woman could get in by herself.

477
00:43:58,514 --> 00:44:01,099
她一直都插手失踪婴儿的事
She has been meddling with our plan.

478
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:02,476
最有可能是她
She's probably the intruder.

479
00:44:02,684 --> 00:44:04,686
公公 让我杀了她
Let me kill her, Master.

480
00:44:04,853 --> 00:44:07,940
这些东西有别的人去做
Leave it to the others.

481
00:44:08,148 --> 00:44:09,399
阿九
Chan Gau.

482
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:14,238
替我杀了她 必要的时候
Kill the woman. And if necessary,

483
00:44:14,488 --> 00:44:16,365
跟她同归于尽
die with her.

484
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:35,384
你这只死老怪物
You damned monster.

485
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:37,845
无论如何我也不能让金针进脑
I won't let the needles go up to my head.

486
00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:03,620
我们现已经证实
We proved that this case is unrelated

487
00:45:03,745 --> 00:45:06,039
这件事与以往的无关
to the previous incidents.

488
00:45:06,248 --> 00:45:07,374
我们已向市长保证
We promised the mayor

489
00:45:07,624 --> 00:45:09,209
以后不会有同样事情发生
it wouldn't happen again.

490
00:45:10,377 --> 00:45:11,712
你的订金呀
Here's your deposit!

491
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:12,838
什么订金呀？
What deposit?

492
00:45:13,005 --> 00:45:14,464
你儿子失踪那事我不干了
I'm not pursuing your son's case!

493
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:17,426
我现在开会 迟些再谈
Hey! We'll talk later. I'm in a meeting.

494
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:18,468
不行
No!

495
00:45:18,635 --> 00:45:19,720
不用再商量了
The deal is off!

496
00:45:19,845 --> 00:45:22,222
小姐 你一定是调查到些什么
Miss. You must have gotten hold of something.

497
00:45:22,431 --> 00:45:24,683
为了十多个婴儿生命 请你说出来
Please tell us for the babies' sake.

498
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,727
告诉你有个屁用？!
What good would it do to me?

499
00:45:26,935 --> 00:45:29,229
你们要是有用便不用聘请我啦
You won't hire me if you can handle it.

500
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:30,147
为了正义 你应该…
For justice, you should--

501
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:31,523
正你妈的
You must have gotten hold of something.

502
00:45:31,648 --> 00:45:33,734
为了正义 我命都没有了
I almost got killed!

503
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:02,137
你把孩子害死了
You killed the baby!

504
00:46:05,307 --> 00:46:07,267
把你知道的告诉我
Tell me what you know.

505
00:46:07,434 --> 00:46:08,852
你以为我会理你吗？
Do you think I'd listen to you?

506
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:10,270
你会
You will.

507
00:46:10,521 --> 00:46:11,980
刚才那娃娃掉下来的时候
When that baby is falling down,

508
00:46:12,147 --> 00:46:13,857
你想也不想就伸手去接
you saved it without a second thought.

509
00:46:42,845 --> 00:46:45,973
是！那个婴儿是我杀死的
Yes, I killed the baby.

510
00:46:46,974 --> 00:46:48,767
现在我也快死了
But I'm dying too.

511
00:46:49,518 --> 00:46:51,520
就这样算了吧？行不行呀？
We are even now!

512
00:46:53,438 --> 00:46:55,190
你还不肯放过我？
Won't you leave me alone?

513
00:46:55,357 --> 00:46:58,402
我只想找个地方静静躲起来死而已
I only want to die in peace!

514
00:46:58,569 --> 00:47:01,822
我只想知道谁偷了婴儿
I want to know who took the babies.

515
00:47:02,614 --> 00:47:04,324
别对付那隐形人
Don't hurt the Invisible Woman!

516
00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:07,452
她只不过是个身不由己的小角色
She's only a puppet.

517
00:47:07,578 --> 00:47:09,037
死老怪物
That damned monster!

518
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:11,999
我死都不让毒针上我脑
I won't let his needles kill me.

519
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:12,958
不要
Don't do that!

520
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:17,546
趁我还有理智之前 你快走
Go away before I lose my mind.

521
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,966
我不走
I'm not leaving.

522
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,051
你会死的
You'll die!

523
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:26,138
死也要死得有价值
It's fine to die for a good reason.

524
00:47:30,601 --> 00:47:32,436
我只可把你体内的毒针暂时封着
I can stop the needles from going further,

525
00:47:32,561 --> 00:47:33,896
但拿不出来
but I can't get them out.

526
00:47:36,064 --> 00:47:37,816
好！我利用这段时间
Okay, I'll use the time you bought me

527
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,943
帮你从公公处取回婴儿
to get the babies back.

528
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:41,528
如果我们要稳操胜券
If we succeed,

529
00:47:41,653 --> 00:47:42,946
一定要拖陈三下水
we must get Chan Sum to help us.

530
00:47:43,071 --> 00:47:43,989
隐形人？
The Invisible Woman?

531
00:47:44,156 --> 00:47:46,617
对！在我未找到陈三之前
Yes. Before I find her, we must be careful.

532
00:47:46,783 --> 00:47:48,368
我们必须小心点
That monster discovered me

533
00:47:48,577 --> 00:47:52,247
上次闯入魔宫 我惊动了那老怪物
when I sneaked into his cave last time.

534
00:47:52,456 --> 00:47:53,540
他以为那个是你
He thought it was you.

535
00:47:53,749 --> 00:47:55,709
他现在派了陈九来对付你
So he is sending Chan Gau to kill you now.

536
00:48:14,436 --> 00:48:16,063
一个来历不明的神经汉
<i>Officer Lau, a madman is holding hostage</i>

537
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:17,689
挟持了几十人在车站内
<i>dozens of people in the station</i>

538
00:48:17,856 --> 00:48:19,274
还破坏了车站的电脑系统
<i>and destroyed the station's computer system.</i>

539
00:48:19,441 --> 00:48:20,817
现在有一班载货的列车
<i>A cargo train is charging</i>

540
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:22,319
正冲向火车站呀
<i>toward the station now.</i>

541
00:48:22,611 --> 00:48:24,112
还有多久火车便撞上火车站？
When will it hit the station?

542
00:48:24,238 --> 00:48:25,322
大概五分钟
<i>In about five minutes.</i>

543
00:48:25,614 --> 00:48:26,240
知道
Got it.

544
00:48:46,218 --> 00:48:47,302
所有单位准备
All units, get ready!

545
00:48:54,977 --> 00:48:56,144
小心地雷
Be careful of the land mines!

546
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:00,023
别踩下去
Don't step on them!

547
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:05,612
别动
Don't move!

548
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:10,158
大家小心 有地雷呀
Be careful! There are land mines!

549
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,420
快进去呀
Watch out! Go now!

550
00:49:21,587 --> 00:49:23,630
还有一分钟火车便撞上车站
The train will crash in one minute.

551
00:49:23,797 --> 00:49:25,007
进去
Go in there!

552
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:26,967
先救里面的人质
Save the hostages inside first.

553
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:34,349
还不进去？
Why aren't you going in?

554
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:02,336
走呀
Run!

555
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:34,409
小心！快撞上了
Brace yourself!

556
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:38,580
让我来
Leave it to me!

557
00:51:17,286 --> 00:51:18,662
快走呀
Run!

558
00:51:18,829 --> 00:51:20,914
站长 怎样才可把车子弄停呀？
Sir, how can we stop the train?

559
00:51:21,081 --> 00:51:22,833
那电脑系统被那神经汉弄坏了
The madman has destroyed the computer!

560
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:24,501
不能停了！走吧
It can't be stopped. Go quickly!

561
00:51:37,598 --> 00:51:40,309
走呀 火车撞进来了
Run! The train is here!

562
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:12,341
接住
Take it!

563
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:19,848
快走
Let's go!

564
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:00,722
老公
Dear.

565
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:07,855
医生怎么说？
What did the doctor say?

566
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:12,693
医生说 幸运的半年便可以走路了
If you're lucky, you can walk in six months.

567
00:53:12,985 --> 00:53:14,361
不幸的呢？
Otherwise?

568
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,866
如果不幸的话…
Otherwise,

569
00:53:20,742 --> 00:53:22,452
可能会残废
you may become a cripple.

570
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:27,416
别这样子
Cheer up.

571
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:30,169
能做女飞侠的老公
As Wonder Woman's husband,

572
00:53:30,335 --> 00:53:33,005
我会支持你每个决定
I'll always stand by you.

573
00:53:33,922 --> 00:53:35,799
你什么时候知道？
When did you find out?

574
00:53:36,466 --> 00:53:38,510
在车站门口
At the station,

575
00:53:39,595 --> 00:53:44,099
你看着我 不想进去的时候
when you looked at me, unwilling to go in.

576
00:53:49,438 --> 00:53:53,150
以后不许偷偷笑
No more secret smiles from now on

577
00:53:54,776 --> 00:53:56,820
也不许躲起来掉眼泪
and no more secret tears.

578
00:53:57,571 --> 00:54:00,949
有什么事要告诉我
Just tell me everything.

579
00:54:08,624 --> 00:54:09,833
好不好？
Okay?

580
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:16,048
老公
Dear.

581
00:54:55,045 --> 00:54:55,963
有花蕾了
Hey! There's a flower bud--

582
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:08,767
你干么？先坐下吧
What's wrong? Sit down first.

583
00:55:08,976 --> 00:55:12,145
不行 我刚想到些头绪
No, I just got a clue.

584
00:55:12,646 --> 00:55:14,398
我要赶快写下来
I must write it down now!

585
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:16,024
你先坐下吧
Sit down first.

586
00:55:16,275 --> 00:55:17,818
你快点出去
Leave now!

587
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,625
你知道了多久？
How long have you known about it?

588
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:36,253
我一直都知道
I've always known about it.

589
00:55:37,462 --> 00:55:40,007
在研究的过程中
In the process,

590
00:55:40,215 --> 00:55:43,343
我发现隐形衣放出一些毒素
I found that the invisible robe emits toxins.

591
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:46,471
所以我一直都不让你留在这里
That's why I always tell you to stay out of here.

592
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,267
但是素心兰已经有花蕾
But a flower bud has grown.

593
00:55:50,434 --> 00:55:54,730
既然花也能救活 我也不会有事
I'll be okay if the flowers can be saved.

594
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:57,065
你快点走吧
Come on, get out of here.

595
00:55:57,232 --> 00:56:01,195
我们是拍档 你这样子 我怎能离开
We are partners. How can I leave you like this?

596
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,366
我的眼镜呢？
Where are my glasses?

597
00:56:06,658 --> 00:56:07,951
你戴着
You're wearing them.

598
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,296
那隐形衣还未完成…
Before the robe is finished,

599
00:56:19,546 --> 00:56:20,923
我是不会死的
I will not die.

600
00:56:23,258 --> 00:56:26,136
我还可以嗅到你头发的香味
I can still smell the fragrance in your hair.

601
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:51,537
（别哭）

602
00:56:56,792 --> 00:56:59,294
不如带我出去看看那些花吧？
Let's look at the flowers outside.

603
00:57:10,013 --> 00:57:11,598
我没事的
I'll be fine.

604
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:13,267
你出去
Get out of here!

605
00:57:19,898 --> 00:57:23,694
放我进来呀
Let me in!

606
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:28,532
就算你能进来 我也不会出去的
I won't go out even if you can get in.

607
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:36,665
那件隐形衣会在素心兰开花时完成
The robe will be ready when the flowers bloom.

608
00:57:36,874 --> 00:57:39,501
你答应我会照顾到它们开花的
You promised to take care of them until then.

609
00:57:39,626 --> 00:57:41,545
你忘记了吗？
Have you forgotten about that?

610
00:57:53,056 --> 00:57:54,057
陈三
Chan Sum.

611
00:57:55,184 --> 00:57:57,477
你为什么还要去见那个老怪物？
Why are you still meeting that monster?

612
00:57:57,853 --> 00:57:59,980
你这样隐瞒 他会放过李之博士吗？
He won't let the professor live anyway.

613
00:58:00,189 --> 00:58:02,733
那隐形衣成功了 他一样要你杀了他
He'll kill him once the robe is finished!

614
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,526
你中了多少针？
How many needles were you attacked with?

615
00:58:06,945 --> 00:58:08,906
只要你肯帮忙
If you help us,

616
00:58:09,364 --> 00:58:11,283
我跟女飞侠都有机会干掉他
Wonder Woman and I may stand a chance to kill him.

617
00:58:31,762 --> 00:58:32,846
这么怕死
If you fear death so much,

618
00:58:33,055 --> 00:58:35,015
都不知道为什么你要去帮女飞侠
how can you help Wonder Woman?

619
00:58:35,224 --> 00:58:36,725
无论你怎么说 我也不会谢谢你的
I won't thank you.

620
00:58:36,892 --> 00:58:38,268
我的命是你捡回来的
You saved my life.

621
00:58:38,477 --> 00:58:40,521
但你问你自己 为了保护博士
But to protect the professor,

622
00:58:40,687 --> 00:58:41,813
你宁愿被老怪物控制
you let that monster control you.

623
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:44,274
你害了多少无辜的婴儿？
You have harmed so many babies.

624
00:58:45,067 --> 00:58:47,694
你骗到别人 骗不到你自己
You can deceive others but not yourself.

625
00:58:48,153 --> 00:58:49,863
现女飞侠可以帮你
Wonder Woman can help you now.

626
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:52,157
明天我会在你放走我的那个地方等你
I'll see you at the same spot tomorrow.

627
00:58:52,282 --> 00:58:53,534
见不到你 我不会走
I'll wait until you come!

628
00:58:57,246 --> 00:58:58,372
你千万要来啊
You'd better come.

629
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,258
我没时间再等了 请你快一点
I don't have time. Please hurry.

630
00:59:14,054 --> 00:59:15,013
成功了
I did it!

631
00:59:17,266 --> 00:59:20,352
心靖…心靖
Sum-ching! Sum-ching!

632
00:59:29,945 --> 00:59:31,029
幸运星
Lucky star.

633
00:59:31,822 --> 00:59:34,324
心靖 隐形衣终于成功了
Sum-ching, the invisible robe is finally finished.

634
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:44,084
为什么隐形衣还未到手？
Why haven't you gotten that robe?

635
00:59:44,293 --> 00:59:48,130
因为隐形衣倘不能在日光下发挥作用
It can't work under the sun yet.

636
00:59:48,338 --> 00:59:50,674
皇上军队的威力便会大减
The strength of the Emperor's army will be reduced.

637
00:59:50,841 --> 00:59:53,594
而方程式已经接近完成阶段
It'll soon be finished.

638
00:59:53,886 --> 00:59:56,805
我想 多给博士几天
Give the professor a few more days.

639
00:59:56,972 --> 01:00:00,601
明天日落前 成功与否
Get it no matter what

640
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:03,228
也要把隐形衣拿到手
before sunset tomorrow.

641
01:00:03,353 --> 01:00:06,148
到时 阿九会帮你
Chan Gau will help you then.

642
01:00:06,607 --> 01:00:10,402
在公公的大计内 我陈三所做的事
Master, all my work in your great plan

643
01:00:10,527 --> 01:00:11,987
算得了什么？
are inconsequential.

644
01:00:12,112 --> 01:00:16,783
只要我在这些储君内找到真命天子
If I find an emperor among those babies,

645
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:19,828
你便是个大功臣
you'll be honored for your services.

646
01:00:30,005 --> 01:00:33,050
所有储君都应该休息
All princes should be asleep.

647
01:00:33,258 --> 01:00:35,469
你不该不去睡
You should go to sleep too.

648
01:00:45,521 --> 01:00:47,356
九月十八日
September 18th.

649
01:00:49,525 --> 01:00:50,901
今天…
Today,

650
01:00:52,027 --> 01:00:52,945
我终于发现了
I've finally solved the UV light problem.

651
01:00:53,153 --> 01:00:56,031
隐形衣克服紫外光的方程式
But I've also reached the end of my life too.

652
01:01:01,537 --> 01:01:04,206
可惜也是到了我死的时候
<i>From the first day when I started working on the invisible robe,</i>

653
01:01:04,665 --> 01:01:07,334
由研究隐形衣的第一天
<i>I knew I would die from the toxins.</i>

654
01:01:08,252 --> 01:01:11,004
我已经知道自己会中毒而死
<i>Without Sum-ching,</i>

655
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:14,675
如果没有心靖的存在
<i>I wouldn't have been able to face it.</i>

656
01:01:14,842 --> 01:01:17,594
我根本没有勇气去面对
<i>If she knows that my only hope now</i>

657
01:01:18,387 --> 01:01:22,724
要是她知道我现在唯一的希望
<i>is to take her hands</i>

658
01:01:22,933 --> 01:01:24,977
只是想捉着她的手
<i>and witness the flowers bloom,</i>

659
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:27,521
一起看素心兰开花
<i>will she still kill me?</i>

660
01:01:28,188 --> 01:01:31,400
不知道…她还会不会杀我？
The day has come.

661
01:01:32,401 --> 01:01:39,575
黄道吉日已到 无论隐形衣成功与否
Regardless of the progress,

662
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:42,703
都要把它拿回来
get the invisible robe

663
01:01:44,663 --> 01:01:49,209
然后 把博士处死
and kill the professor.

664
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:07,269
博士 我以后都不会再回来的了
Professor, I'll never return to you.

665
01:02:07,561 --> 01:02:10,731
见不到你 我是不会离开的
<i>I won't leave until I see you.</i>

666
01:02:10,939 --> 01:02:12,232
相信我
Believe me.

667
01:02:13,192 --> 01:02:14,943
你现在的处境非常危险
You are in great danger.

668
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:16,778
尽快离开实验室吧
Leave the lab now.

669
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:22,576
真笨
Damn it!

670
01:02:22,784 --> 01:02:24,536
连女飞侠都迟到
Even Wonder Woman is late.

671
01:02:24,745 --> 01:02:28,248
笨蛋！早知道不约什么不见不散
I shouldn't have promised to come.

672
01:02:28,582 --> 01:02:30,042
都不知道该不该走
Should I leave or not?

673
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:43,388
你还真赏脸
Great. There you are.

674
01:02:43,597 --> 01:02:45,599
是公公叫我来杀你的
Master sent me to kill you.

675
01:02:47,351 --> 01:02:48,810
慢点 陈三
Wait, Chan Sum.

676
01:02:48,977 --> 01:02:51,939
动手吧 这次我不会放过你的
I won't let you go this time.

677
01:02:52,231 --> 01:02:54,066
你以为你能忍心下手吗？
Can you really do it?

678
01:02:54,316 --> 01:02:56,610
公公的命令我一定要执行
I must execute Master's order.

679
01:02:56,944 --> 01:02:58,403
但我可以答应你
But I can promise you

680
01:02:58,612 --> 01:03:00,614
你死了之后我可以帮你做一件事
that I'll do you a favor after you die.

681
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:03,033
曼着！现在死的未必是我
Wait, it might be you who'll die.

682
01:03:03,283 --> 01:03:04,201
也许是你

683
01:03:04,409 --> 01:03:05,160
有什么未做完的事情

684
01:03:05,327 --> 01:03:07,037
我可以帮你 你说吧
Tell me your last wish. Tell me!

685
01:03:07,871 --> 01:03:08,997
那么帮我照顾博士吧
Take care of the professor.

686
01:03:09,122 --> 01:03:10,040
博士？
The professor?

687
01:03:27,975 --> 01:03:29,393
替我去救博士
Save the professor for me.

688
01:03:40,279 --> 01:03:41,780
陈三 你干什么？
Chan Sum, what are you doing?

689
01:03:41,947 --> 01:03:42,823
她不是来杀人
She didn't come to kill you.

690
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:44,366
她是来自杀
She came to kill herself.

691
01:03:45,033 --> 01:03:46,660
你不要自己的命来救那个家伙？
You are giving up your life to save him?

692
01:03:46,827 --> 01:03:48,036
自己的命？
My life?

693
01:03:48,996 --> 01:03:51,790
我只不过是公公一只杀人野兽而已
I am just Master's killing machine.

694
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:53,709
野兽是不会有感情的
A machine won't have feelings

695
01:03:53,876 --> 01:03:56,378
更加不会为了另一个人牺牲自己
or sacrifice themselves for someone.

696
01:04:05,888 --> 01:04:07,389
你肯面对自己
Life is meaningful

697
01:04:07,556 --> 01:04:10,309
你的生命比死更有意义
if you can face yourself.

698
01:04:10,517 --> 01:04:12,019
我就是不能够面对自己
Not just myself,

699
01:04:12,227 --> 01:04:13,687
更加不能面对他
but I can't even face him!

700
01:04:13,896 --> 01:04:16,106
陈三…
Chan Sum!

701
01:04:21,195 --> 01:04:22,696
这样便走光了？
So you're all leaving?

702
01:04:23,864 --> 01:04:25,866
碰碰你也走开？!
Damn, can't you stay put?

703
01:04:26,074 --> 01:04:27,868
还是骑自己的铁马比较听话
My own bike is better.

704
01:04:30,162 --> 01:04:31,330
等等我呀
Wait for me!

705
01:04:36,919 --> 01:04:38,003
陈三
Chan Sum!

706
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:40,255
你可以由现在开始改变的
You can change yourself from now on!

707
01:04:40,422 --> 01:04:42,257
那又如何？我不一样是陈三？
So what? I'm still Chan Sum!

708
01:04:42,424 --> 01:04:44,426
陈三又如何？可以变陈七嘛
You can be another Chan Chat!

709
01:04:44,593 --> 01:04:47,554
太迟了！你们别跟着我 让我来
It's too late! Leave me alone!

710
01:04:52,809 --> 01:04:55,604
真讨厌！铁马也不够真马跑得快？!
Shit! Even a bike can't catch up?

711
01:04:55,771 --> 01:04:56,522
去
Go!

712
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:03,570
你能够逃避你以前做的事
You've shunned your past.

713
01:05:03,779 --> 01:05:05,489
这分钟才是你的真本性
This is your true self!

714
01:05:05,697 --> 01:05:07,115
那么我更加该死
I shouldn't live then!

715
01:05:10,953 --> 01:05:11,870
不要
No!

716
01:05:25,509 --> 01:05:26,552
糟糕
This is bad!

717
01:05:31,765 --> 01:05:33,475
你两个闯了个祸出来了
You two are in great trouble!

718
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:35,936
命大 撑着吧
So lucky. Brace yourselves!

719
01:05:51,702 --> 01:05:52,911
东东？
Tung-tung?

720
01:05:53,704 --> 01:05:55,122
青青？
Ching-ching?

721
01:05:55,789 --> 01:05:59,668
你放手 不然会一起掉下去
Let go of my hand or we'll both fall!

722
01:05:59,835 --> 01:06:00,794
不放
No!

723
01:06:03,088 --> 01:06:04,798
接住呀
Grab it!

724
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:10,596
我撑不住了！撑不住了
I can't hold on any longer!

725
01:06:13,348 --> 01:06:14,474
我不会放手的
I won't let go!

726
01:06:14,683 --> 01:06:15,976
要放一起放
We must be together.

727
01:06:17,644 --> 01:06:18,979
真的是你
It's really you.

728
01:06:19,563 --> 01:06:21,231
你两个认识的吗？
You two knew each other?

729
01:06:25,152 --> 01:06:26,153
我忘记了
I don't remember.

730
01:06:26,361 --> 01:06:27,487
以前的东西不重要
The past is trivial.

731
01:06:27,696 --> 01:06:30,240
最重要是你现在心里面想做些什么
What matters is the thing you wish to do now.

732
01:06:31,491 --> 01:06:34,161
你想做什么便说嘛
Hey! What do you want to do?

733
01:06:35,662 --> 01:06:37,122
公公派了陈九去杀博士
Master sent Chan Gau to kill the professor.

734
01:06:37,372 --> 01:06:38,749
我要回去救他
I want to save him.

735
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:40,209
博士？!
The professor?

736
01:07:11,865 --> 01:07:12,950
拿来
Give it to me.

737
01:07:43,605 --> 01:07:46,149
隐形衣已经可以见紫外光
The invisible robe can withstand UV light now.

738
01:07:46,316 --> 01:07:47,860
没有人可以找到它
Nobody can find it.

739
01:07:49,486 --> 01:07:51,071
不要呀
No!

740
01:07:55,909 --> 01:08:00,956
心靖我还有很多事对你说
Sum-ching. I have so much to tell you.

741
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:03,250
全在那份礼物里
It's all inside the gift box.

742
01:08:17,514 --> 01:08:18,891
你怎么打他也没用
It doesn't matter how hard you hit him.

743
01:08:19,057 --> 01:08:20,767
他拿不到他要的 他绝对不会放手
He'll stick to what he wants.

744
01:08:21,143 --> 01:08:29,484
不行！你不可以给他的
No! You can't give it to him.

745
01:08:29,735 --> 01:08:31,320
我现在什么都没有
I have lost everything.

746
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:32,821
我不可以让他死
I can't let him die.

747
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:52,799
对不起
I'm sorry.

748
01:08:53,717 --> 01:08:56,720
我知道公公是不能令你杀我的
I knew Master can't make you kill me.

749
01:09:14,446 --> 01:09:15,656
拿得这么容易？
It won't be that easy!

750
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:25,165
慢着 等一等…
Wait, hold on!

751
01:09:52,734 --> 01:09:55,237
小白痴 声带在这儿
Idiot, here's the tape.

752
01:09:55,612 --> 01:09:57,739
过来拿吧！快来拿走
Come and get it!

753
01:10:06,373 --> 01:10:07,624
再见了
Goodbye!

754
01:10:09,543 --> 01:10:11,628
炉太热了 不能再留在这里
It's too hot here!

755
01:10:37,613 --> 01:10:41,033
心靖 仪器毁灭了
Sum-ching, it's better to have it destroyed

756
01:10:41,283 --> 01:10:43,243
总好过落在他手里
than to let him have it.

757
01:10:43,619 --> 01:10:44,912
走吧
Hey! Let's go!

758
01:10:51,376 --> 01:10:52,252
你们走吧
Go ahead.

759
01:10:52,711 --> 01:10:53,295
那么你…
What about-

760
01:10:53,504 --> 01:10:54,796
由她去
Let her be.

761
01:10:56,256 --> 01:10:57,424
去哪里呀？
Where are we going?

762
01:10:57,674 --> 01:10:59,635
我们去魔宫救婴儿
To save the babies from the cave.

763
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:03,180
只我们两个？让我回去拿点家伙
Just the two of us? Let me get my stuff first.

764
01:11:06,642 --> 01:11:10,729
可否让我看看开了花的素心兰？
May I look at the blooming flowers?

765
01:11:55,649 --> 01:11:57,150
所有婴儿都放在这里
All the babies are here.

766
01:11:57,317 --> 01:11:58,694
但切勿触动任何东西
Don't touch anything.

767
01:11:58,861 --> 01:12:01,572
如果在这儿开杀戒 婴儿们都会没命
The babies will die if we fight here.

768
01:12:24,052 --> 01:12:26,221
死老怪物 快来受死
You damned monster, come on and die!

769
01:12:26,388 --> 01:12:28,640
这里很重沼气 小心中毒
Beware. This place is full of methane.

770
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:37,357
你这死老怪物 沼气当氧气
You damned monster like methane more than oxygen.

771
01:12:37,524 --> 01:12:38,567
我宰了你
I'll kill you.

772
01:12:43,155 --> 01:12:45,449
你两个胆敢闯进我禁宫？
How dare you come here!

773
01:12:45,574 --> 01:12:46,700
揍她
Attack her!

774
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:51,038
特异功能？
Special powers?

775
01:13:09,306 --> 01:13:10,265
你现在才来跪他？
You are kneeling to him now? Weren't you bold before?

776
01:13:10,432 --> 01:13:11,892
你的骨气那里去了？
I can't help it.

777
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:14,269
我不是跪他
My legs feel like jelly.

778
01:13:14,436 --> 01:13:15,771
我是腿软呀
Do you think someone like you can beat me?

779
01:13:16,021 --> 01:13:18,732
就凭你两个就想以下犯上
It's no use kneeling to me. Guards, go!

780
01:13:18,899 --> 01:13:22,027
你跪我也没用了 四大护法
-Yes! -Yes!

781
01:13:22,694 --> 01:13:23,987
反正都是死路一条
We have no way out now.

782
01:13:24,154 --> 01:13:26,406
你对付公公 我去对付那四个
Deal with Master, I'll handle the others.

783
01:13:26,615 --> 01:13:27,991
冲呀
Go!

784
01:14:06,864 --> 01:14:10,075
能够死在我手上 是你的光荣
It's an honor to die by my hands.

785
01:14:10,492 --> 01:14:12,911
糟了 不知是否多吸了沼气 很兴奋
Damn it. I think I'm high on methane.

786
01:14:13,078 --> 01:14:14,830
怎么办？一定不是他的对手
What should we do? We can't beat him.

787
01:14:14,913 --> 01:14:16,748
别让他集中精神 上
Don't let him concentrate. Go!

788
01:14:17,374 --> 01:14:19,376
这次我要取你们的命
I'll kill you this time.

789
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:41,815
东东 快带陈七走
Tung-tung, go with Chan Chat!

790
01:14:42,024 --> 01:14:43,233
不行 我要跟她拼命
No, I'll fight until the end!

791
01:14:43,358 --> 01:14:44,151
不要
No!

792
01:14:45,402 --> 01:14:47,029
你们再不走 便会中毒
You'll be poisoned if you stay.

793
01:14:56,455 --> 01:14:58,123
撑不住了 先吸点氧气
Let's go!

794
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:23,106
去你的！你们去死吧
I'll need some oxygen.

795
01:15:48,966 --> 01:15:51,552
好了！这次还不连你的毛都炸掉？!
Go to hell, all of you!

796
01:15:54,137 --> 01:15:55,931
怎么这个迟得那么厉害？
He must have been blown up to pieces this time.

797
01:15:56,056 --> 01:15:57,099
他还没有死
Why is this one so late? He's still alive!

798
01:16:17,411 --> 01:16:18,370
炸死你
Damn you!

799
01:16:24,376 --> 01:16:25,502
他怕光的
He's afraid of lights.

800
01:16:25,794 --> 01:16:26,920
再多掷几个
Give me some more.

801
01:17:22,935 --> 01:17:26,855
糟了？我的脸有没有事呀？
Is my face still pretty?

802
01:17:28,065 --> 01:17:30,234
干什么…
What?

803
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:31,318
我不知道你死了没有
I don't know if you're fine or not,

804
01:17:31,485 --> 01:17:33,195
我却被你吓死了
but you scared me to death!

805
01:17:49,878 --> 01:17:51,171
他还没有死？
He's still alive?

806
01:18:17,573 --> 01:18:18,740
他还会动
How is this possible?

807
01:18:18,907 --> 01:18:20,200
他的肉身虽毁了
We destroyed his body,

808
01:18:20,409 --> 01:18:22,369
但他的意志还能控制自己
but his mind is still there.

809
01:18:47,394 --> 01:18:49,229
他控制住我
He has gained control over me!

810
01:18:49,938 --> 01:18:51,190
我来帮你
Let me help you.

811
01:18:51,356 --> 01:18:52,649
别过来呀
Don't come near me!

812
01:18:57,905 --> 01:18:59,573
我控制不了自己
I can't control myself!

813
01:19:04,244 --> 01:19:06,997
快走！走呀
Go. Quick!

814
01:19:07,414 --> 01:19:09,124
带陈七走呀
Go with Chan Chat!

815
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:38,737
怎办？
What should we do?

816
01:19:38,904 --> 01:19:39,780
走
Go!

817
01:19:56,755 --> 01:19:58,131
青青
Ching-ching!

818
01:19:58,298 --> 01:20:00,467
别让我再打
Don't let me do it again!

819
01:20:00,843 --> 01:20:03,554
你妈的
Fuck you!

820
01:20:03,762 --> 01:20:06,473
你死吧你…
Die!

821
01:20:07,266 --> 01:20:08,767
走呀
Go!

822
01:20:11,228 --> 01:20:12,813
去你的白骨精
You son of a bitch!

823
01:20:32,082 --> 01:20:34,042
他上了我身 快离开这里
He's controlling my body, go!

824
01:20:34,209 --> 01:20:36,044
要死 就大家一起死
We won't leave you behind!

825
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:38,589
我重见你已很开心的了
I'm happy to have met you again!

826
01:20:40,632 --> 01:20:42,050
对不起呀
I'm sorry!

827
01:20:42,676 --> 01:20:44,553
陈三
Chan Sum!

828
01:20:48,265 --> 01:20:49,725
- 陈三 - 青青
-Chan Sum! -Ching-ching!

829
01:20:49,933 --> 01:20:53,520
老怪物 一起死吧
I'll die with you, damned monster!

830
01:20:53,687 --> 01:20:59,735
中国是不可以没皇帝的…
<i>China must have an emperor.</i>

831
01:21:07,451 --> 01:21:09,494
以前的不重要 最重要是现在
<i>China must have an emperor.</i>

832
01:21:09,703 --> 01:21:18,003
中国是不可没皇帝的
<i>What's important is today, not the past.</i>

833
01:21:19,588 --> 01:21:26,386
可否跟我一起看素心兰开花？
<i>Can we see the blooming flowers together?</i>

834
01:21:26,553 --> 01:21:29,389
博士
Professor!

835
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:58,085
青青
Ching-ching.

836
01:22:00,587 --> 01:22:02,130
你不会死的
You won't die.

837
01:22:06,176 --> 01:22:07,928
老老实实 你们在地面才说吧
Hey! Get on the ground before you talk.

838
01:22:08,136 --> 01:22:09,972
不然我会死的
Otherwise, I'll die!

839
01:22:18,313 --> 01:22:19,773
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

840
01:22:20,858 --> 01:22:22,150
陈七呢？
Where's Chan Chat?

841
01:22:23,193 --> 01:22:25,529
有好东西…
I got something good!

842
01:22:25,696 --> 01:22:28,448
来一件吧 不然一会有记者来拍照
Take one, or when the press comes,

843
01:22:28,615 --> 01:22:31,159
我们这样子很不体面嘛
we'll look shabby!

844
01:22:31,451 --> 01:22:33,453
来 披上它吧
Come on, put them on!

845
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,070
轰动一时的婴儿失踪案
<i>The police have solved</i>

846
01:23:07,196 --> 01:23:09,031
已被警方瓦解了
<i>the missing babies case.</i>

847
01:23:09,281 --> 01:23:12,492
大部分失踪婴儿已寻回
<i>Most of the missing babies have been found.</i>

848
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:15,245
以下是本台记者现场报导
<i>Here's our live report.</i>

849
01:23:15,412 --> 01:23:16,580
传闻此案是由
<i>We heard that</i>

850
01:23:16,914 --> 01:23:18,290
三位来历不明的女侠所侦破
<i>three unknown heroines solved it.</i>

851
01:23:18,457 --> 01:23:21,043
不知道他们跟警方有什么关系呢？
<i>How are they related to the police?</i>

852
01:23:21,210 --> 01:23:23,712
没密切的关系 他们是警方的朋友
<i>They are close friends of the police.</i>

853
01:23:23,879 --> 01:23:25,297
那么他们三位是什么身份？
<i>Who are they?</i>

854
01:23:25,422 --> 01:23:26,256
无可奉告
<i>No comment.</i>

855
01:23:26,381 --> 01:23:29,176
那么你知不知她们什么时候再出现呢
<i>When will they come again?</i>

856
01:23:29,384 --> 01:23:31,386
有需要的话他们便会出现
<i>When we need them.</i>

857
01:23:31,595 --> 01:23:33,889
那么你知不知道她们叫什么名字？
<i>Do you know their names?</i>

858
01:23:34,431 --> 01:23:36,850
叫什么名字？
<i>-Their names? -Yes, their names.</i>

859
01:23:37,059 --> 01:23:39,102
她们叫“东方三侠“
<i>They are called The Heroic Trio.</i>

860
01:23:40,103 --> 01:23:41,647
我们什么时候起了这个名字
<i>-The Heroic Trio? -The Heroic Trio?</i>

861
01:23:41,855 --> 01:23:42,689
你怎会知道她们的名字？
When did we get that name?

862
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:43,565
这名字是怎来的？
<i>-How do you know that?</i>

863
01:23:43,732 --> 01:23:45,734
这是警方的高度秘密 对不起…
-Where does the name come from? <i>-It's top-secret, I'm sorry.</i>

864
01:23:45,901 --> 01:23:47,194
随便说一个而已
I was just improvising it a bit.

865
01:23:47.319 --> 01:23:50.405
谁和谁和谁之间

866
01:23:50.572 --> 01:23:54.243
相识结合了患难

867
01:23:54.409 --> 01:23:57.955
情和情和情的关

868
01:23:58.163 --> 01:24:01.750
辗转里掠过站和站

869
01:24:01.917 --> 01:24:05.170
一曲一折只是我

870
01:24:05.504 --> 01:24:09.299
一转身某一天某一刻的事

871
01:24:09.424 --> 01:24:13.011
一举一动都只是

872
01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:16.807
闲事难事然后变传奇事

873
01:24:17.057 --> 01:24:20.519
人和人和人之间

874
01:24:20.769 --> 01:24:24.314
沧桑里自有浪漫

875
01:24:24.606 --> 01:24:28.068
日复夜复日之间

876
01:24:28.277 --> 01:24:31.822
崎岖夹杂了梦幻

877
01:24:32.072 --> 01:24:35.284
一曲一折只是我

878
01:24:35.617 --> 01:24:39.413
一转身某一天某一刻的事

879
01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:43.000
一举一动都只是

880
01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:46.920
闲事难事然后变传奇事

881
01:24:47.671 --> 01:24:51.091
莫问当初我哀我乐我陪着我

882
01:24:51.341 --> 01:24:54.595
步步惊心我走我的路

883
01:24:54.761 --> 01:24:58.599
莫问今天对天对地我仍是我

884
01:24:58.807 --> 01:25:02.269
在是是非非里举步

885
01:25:02.644 --> 01:25:05.981
莫问他朝到底有没有谁像我

886
01:25:06.315 --> 01:25:09.818
任动地惊天放声笑傲

887
01:25:10.152 --> 01:25:13.614
莫问一生有风有月有谁伴我

888
01:25:13.947 --> 01:25:17.284
在大地不必各走各路

889
01:25:17.451 --> 01:25:20.829
人和人和人之间

890
01:25:20.996 --> 01:25:24.666
沧桑里自有浪漫

891
01:25:24.833 --> 01:25:28.253
日复夜复日之间

892
01:25:28.504 --> 01:25:32.341
崎岖夹杂了梦幻

893
01:25:32.508 --> 01:25:35.511
一曲一折只是我

894
01:25:35.719 --> 01:25:39.681
一转身某一天某一刻的事

895
01:25:39.848 --> 01:25:43.060
一举一动都只是

896
01:25:43.519 --> 01:25:46.939
闲事难事然后变传奇事
