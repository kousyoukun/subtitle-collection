1
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,501
<i>The city is shocked by missing baby cases.</i>

2
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:11,172
<i>Eighteen babies were taken
in the past three months.</i>

3
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,007
<i>The police have made no breakthrough</i>

4
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,468
<i>and the investigations
have reached the bottleneck.</i>

5
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,805
<i>-The Commissioner of Police…</i>
-All my clients have good lives.

6
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,141
Here we are. Stop!

7
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,309
I'm coming!

8
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,019
Something is wrong.

9
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:29,858
Damn it.

10
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:30,775
Forget it.

11
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,111
Be careful.

12
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,238
Look!

13
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,532
It's a stylish building!

14
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,741
Let's take a look inside.

15
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,619
This way, please.

16
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,289
This way.

17
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,332
This house is elegant

18
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,294
and there is no one else here within 1 km.

19
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,715
It's only a five-minute ride
to the market.

20
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,426
This house can't be that perfect.
Surely there must be some defects.

21
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,886
There is a little defect,

22
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,679
but it won't be a problem.

23
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:02,974
This way.

24
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,601
The defect is that

25
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,102
it's not really renovated.

26
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,108
You call this as not really renovated?

27
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,776
The structure is fine.

28
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,403
There was just a little fire.

29
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,532
-Honey.
-Hush.

30
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,037
I'll show you something.

31
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,293
Nature!

32
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,634
You'll love this place in no time.

33
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:40,345
What do you think?

34
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,263
Damn it.

35
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,723
I've asked the owner

36
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:44,933
to renovate the house first.

37
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,226
What a waste of time!

38
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,563
How lucky!

39
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,775
Who the hell would buy it now?

40
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,235
Damn it!

41
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,903
-Let's go.
-Don't move!

42
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,948
Dear, let's buy it.

43
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,074
I like it.

44
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,283
It has character.

45
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,660
Character?

46
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,704
-Really?
-You know how I like it.

47
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,039
I know.

48
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,000
Pay the deposit first then.

49
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:11,918
Quiet!

50
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,857
Did you try to steal my car?
Put this on yourself.

51
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,027
Okay, I'll put it on myself.

52
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,571
Incredible!

53
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,449
Of course. My husband is a policeman.

54
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,120
Keep walking.

55
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,121
Aren't I walking now?

56
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,747
<i>Up until today,</i>

57
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,625
18 babies went missing
in the past two months.

58
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,795
They seem like the work of one person.

59
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:59,924
None of the missing babies' families

60
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,759
has received any blackmail letters so far.

61
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:05,054
Nor has any political or terrorist group
claimed responsibility.

62
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,889
Chief, this is bizarre.

63
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,476
Shall we approach Wonder Woman?

64
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,813
Even though she helped us before,

65
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,399
we still don't know who she is.

66
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,985
We can't reach her at all.

67
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,487
All missing babies are boys.

68
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:25,033
This shows that it's not blackmailing.

69
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,452
Hey…

70
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,662
Maybe it has something to do with cults.

71
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,226
Did anyone rush out
of the conference room?

72
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,478
No.

73
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,646
Chief!

74
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,253
Come with me.

75
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,427
The babies' ward is upstairs.
Operation rooms are over there.

76
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,556
I'm worried about our son.

77
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,643
-Let's take him home now.
-Lau!

78
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,103
He was just born this morning.

79
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,563
The doctor won't take the risk
if we discharge him now.

80
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,357
-Lau--
-Fine! We'll leave him here.

81
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,776
Why didn't you call Wonder Woman for help?

82
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,862
Ma'am, we have no way to contact her.

83
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,906
I've sent more men here.

84
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,659
Staying here is just as safe
as staying at home.

85
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,162
-Take care of her!
-Okay.

86
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,124
Chief, Officer Lau, there's a bus crash
in the Southern District just now.

87
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,000
The warden might need these beds,

88
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,210
so we need to think about it.

89
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,378
Lau.

90
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,504
You may leave first.

91
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:05,842
Lau.

92
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,137
It's my son that they are after.

93
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,640
How about we find someone

94
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,100
to swap with my son?

95
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,393
Whose son?

96
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,687
I guess that's immoral.

97
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,647
They want your son.

98
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,065
They will find him eventually.

99
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:25,069
Yes, it'd be embarrassing if others knew.

100
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,572
Let's brace ourselves.

101
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,491
Brace ourselves.…

102
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,203
I'm sorry, ma'am.

103
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,706
Officer Lau said no one can enter
without his permission.

104
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:37,957
Forget it!

105
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,165
Look up there!

106
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,292
-What's wrong?
-The babies are falling down!

107
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,839
-Catch them!
-Catch them!

108
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,216
-My son!
-My son!

109
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,592
Catch our son!

110
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,427
Which one is our son?

111
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,179
Either one of them can be him!

112
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,847
Which one?

113
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,168
Wonder Woman!

114
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,381
-Wonder Woman!
-Wonder Woman!

115
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,434
She's coming down!

116
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,446
There's some blood on the wall.
Run some tests on it.

117
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,708
This is not our baby.

118
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,752
This is not our baby!

119
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,422
It's a girl!

120
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:34,884
-A girl? It's my daughter!
-Hey!

121
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,552
I'm so glad you are fine.

122
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,429
-I was so scared.
-This is bad.

123
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,474
Get someone to collect the blood sample.

124
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,225
-Yes, sir. Come with me.
-Okay.

125
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,818
-Hello?
<i>-Tung-tung, another baby is missing.</i>

126
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,570
<i>I'll be back late tonight.</i>

127
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,988
Okay.

128
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,406
<i>Are you upset?</i>

129
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,450
No. Work hard tonight.

130
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,035
<i>-Goodbye.</i>
-Goodbye.

131
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,171
You always like to fight.
I'll chop off your head next time.

132
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,380
Guard the door!

133
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:47,099
Master, here is the baby boy you want.

134
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:11,290
Take the 19th prince inside

135
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,293
to rest with the other princes.

136
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,836
Yes, Master.

137
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,463
Sum.

138
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:23,260
Your heart is beating too fast.

139
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,512
No, it's not.

140
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,557
Memories do you no good,

141
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,519
neither do feelings or emotions.

142
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,728
I don't have any.

143
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:36,565
I'll wait for the next auspicious day.

144
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,110
Among all the babies,

145
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,406
I'll choose one to be the emperor.

146
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:51,872
China must have an emperor.

147
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,626
-China must have an emperor.
-China must have an emperor.

148
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,921
China must have an emperor.

149
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,817
Either you climb up by yourself

150
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,527
or you will fall!

151
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,279
No one can help you.

152
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,321
Climb up!

153
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,868
Ching-ching, climb up!

154
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:35,291
Don't fall! Climb!

155
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,972
Did you have a nightmare again?

156
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,184
May I come in?

157
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,977
I'm working.

158
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,396
You know
I don't want anyone to disturb me.

159
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,734
I've been dreaming of the invisible robe
every night for years.

160
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:47,780
Last night,
I dreamt that it was finally completed.

161
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,491
Has it always been kept in the safe?

162
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,285
Yes, why?

163
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,205
The police called today

164
00:15:56,288 --> 00:16:00,042
and asked me how one can be invisible.

165
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,507
Before the invisible robe is finished,

166
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,258
you don't want others to know about it.

167
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,511
Even if it's finished,

168
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,471
I want to keep it a secret forever

169
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,264
because an invention like this

170
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,059
may easily be used as a war weapon.

171
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,395
Then why are you still working on it?

172
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,646
What does it mean to you?

173
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,023
I feel the happiest

174
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,651
when I'm glued to my work.

175
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,404
Don't you worry that I'd steal it?

176
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,239
No.

177
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,491
You can't steal what's already yours.

178
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,703
Do you want some coffee?

179
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,663
Yes, please.

180
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,503
FORTUNE-TELLER

181
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,604
Miss, the dates of birth

182
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:44,938
of those 18 babies…

183
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,523
Are they related in any way?

184
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,233
It's strange.

185
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,570
They all have a royal destiny.

186
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,238
They are all fated to be emperors!

187
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,782
Emperors?

188
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,784
Why would anyone kidnap
so many little emperors?

189
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,331
My sister!

190
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,907
Do you want some? Come over then.

191
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,794
Come.

192
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,338
Come.

193
00:18:58,846 --> 00:18:59,847
Are you talking to me?

194
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,310
No.

195
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:18,282
<i>May I kiss you?</i>

196
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:26,790
Why are you smiling?

197
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,042
Am I? It's nothing.

198
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,393
Go down!

199
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,394
Stand on one side!

200
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,146
-Stand together! Quickly!
-Quickly!

201
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,028
Gosh! Who are they, Lau?

202
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,905
Three armed robbers with criminal records

203
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,281
just robbed a cash escort car

204
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,866
and were chased here by our men.

205
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,242
There are eight hostages inside

206
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,744
including drivers and guards.

207
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,329
What do we do now?

208
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,539
-We will force them out.
-Give me one!

209
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,922
Get ready!

210
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:15,923
Fire!

211
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,388
-Calm down, it's tear gas. Wear masks!
-Wear masks!

212
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:27,976
Get out!

213
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,770
Damn! Get out!

214
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,230
Quickly!

215
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:33,899
Give me the revolver!

216
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,573
-Don't fire!
-Listen up!

217
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,742
There are many more hostages inside!

218
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,453
Get me a helicopter in two hours

219
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,289
or I'll kill one hostage
every five minutes!

220
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,106
Hello, sirs!

221
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,776
Who is she?

222
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,820
A professional gunner, Chan Chat.

223
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,738
Sir, don't call me that.

224
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,865
I only kill those who deserve to die.

225
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,617
Call me Thief Catcher.

226
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,869
The police won't hire you.

227
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,079
Hire?

228
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:32,666
Sir, I'll do you a favor this time.

229
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:33,750
It's free of charge.

230
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,630
-Get them!
-Yes, sir!

231
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,762
I surrender! Don't fire!

232
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,638
I surrender! Don't…

233
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,225
Rescue the hostages!

234
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,644
-Rescue the hostages.
-Let's go.

235
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:37,564
-Rescue the hostages.
-Come on!

236
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,775
Lie down!

237
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,027
-Get the hostages!
-Get them!

238
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,951
Go and see
if there are still hostages inside!

239
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,924
I'm married.

240
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,258
So?

241
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,718
It seems like

242
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,887
only I can get your son back.

243
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,723
Pay me 500,000 if he's alive

244
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,392
and 150,000 if you don't mind he's dead.

245
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,228
I only take gold. Here's my number.

246
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,813
Call me after you've thought about it.

247
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:02,691
The newspaper has been used.

248
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,652
The one who placed the advertisement is
not here for the babies. Warn the others.

249
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,237
-Yes, sir.
-Mrs. Lau, you may go.

250
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:10,657
Please show me your pass.

251
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,122
What brings you here tonight?

252
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,290
I promised the head nurse

253
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,167
to come and help every alternate day.

254
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,961
-The old lady up there--
-Won't do physiotherapy without you.

255
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,546
So you know that already.

256
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,965
I'm busy. I can't take care of you.

257
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,634
-Stay safe.
-You too.

258
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,760
Are you the one who placed
the advertisement?

259
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:12,844
Are you a cop?

260
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,472
Listen.

261
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,308
I'm going to kill all the babies tonight.

262
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,277
What are you doing?

263
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:33,573
No!

264
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,160
Don't move or I'll kill her!

265
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,828
Calm down.

266
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:40,997
Drop that!

267
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,540
Or I'll kill her!

268
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,084
Drop that knife first!

269
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,336
-I'll kill her!
-Okay! I'm dropping it!

270
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,214
Go inside!

271
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,215
I'll kill her!

272
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:52,801
Go inside!

273
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,095
Those doctors killed my son.

274
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,429
This is my revenge!

275
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,392
-I'll kill all those babies!
<i>-Dr. Wong.</i>

276
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,935
<i>Please hurry to the emergency ward.</i>

277
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,645
<i>Dr. Wong, please hurry to the emergency--</i>

278
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,816
I'll kill all the babies!

279
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:09,985
You're bleeding!

280
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:11,653
Wipe it off.

281
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:12,779
I'm fine.

282
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,117
Hey.

283
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,244
Do you think we can break down the door?

284
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,954
No way, it's too thick.

285
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,581
Let me try.

286
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,222
The keys are just outside.

287
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,769
Just a bit more and I could get them!

288
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,396
Calm down.

289
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,939
The madman won't be back so soon.

290
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,028
I'm only worried about the babies.

291
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,572
Didn't you hear what he said just now?

292
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,073
Let me try.

293
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:19,929
Why aren't you leaving?

294
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:34,903
Roger that.

295
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,280
Stay calm, speak slowly.

296
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:41,576
-Just one person?
-<i>Yes!</i>

297
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,830
You are late! Are you new here?

298
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,300
Take him out.

299
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,760
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

300
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,012
Don't move! Get up!

301
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,139
-I'll kill all the babies!
-Move!

302
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:04,641
<i>Dear!</i>

303
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,518
<i>Dear?</i>

304
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,897
-I have captured the madman.
-I know.

305
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,399
Thank you for informing me on time.

306
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,234
-I didn't come here for nothing.
-Come here.

307
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,661
-Any rewards?
-No!

308
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,582
-Don't keep the old lady waiting.
-It's done already.

309
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,049
Naughty! Are you laughing at me?

310
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,595
Are you leaving with me?

311
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,681
No. The real one hasn't turned up yet.

312
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:45,765
What?

313
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:46,933
Why are you surprised?

314
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:51,187
You're nosy. Let's go for a ride.

315
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,776
Let's go!

316
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,405
Officer Lau, someone is kidnapping a baby.

317
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,670
Don't shoot! The baby might be in there!

318
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,634
Attention. Don't fire!

319
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,094
Don't fire!

320
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,144
I'm leaving!

321
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,939
-Go after her!
-Go after her!

322
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,696
-Go after her!
-Go after her!

323
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,492
The Thief Catcher?

324
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,083
Hey, Nosy. What's with your mouth?

325
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,960
Don't sleep. More fun is coming.

326
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,712
Isn't it fun?

327
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,469
There you are. Follow me!

328
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,075
Let's take a rest first.

329
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,871
I can't believe you still can't get me.

330
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,456
What a shame.

331
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,804
Not even a noise? That's sinister!

332
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,598
So you're a woman!

333
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,267
So you're a bitch!

334
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,440
Hey.

335
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,820
Hey.

336
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:09,117
Why did you kidnap all those babies?

337
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,786
What? You're blaming me for that?

338
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,664
You look pretty smart.

339
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:17,208
-Are you that Wonder Woman?
-Are you the Thief Catcher?

340
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,835
Don't get in my way then!

341
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,714
How could you use a baby

342
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:23,882
as your bait?

343
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,049
How despicable!

344
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,259
That's enough!

345
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,890
Put the baby down first.

346
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,183
Let's see if you can make me do that!

347
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,258
That was just a warm-up.
Now, it's the real thing!

348
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,559
Hey, wait!

349
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,694
What's happening?

350
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,698
Invisible Woman?

351
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,953
There's one more person here?

352
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,185
She seems to be on my side.

353
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,655
The baby!

354
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,373
Be careful!

355
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,436
How's the baby? Hey!

356
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,023
Wait, who are you? Hey!

357
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,777
Everything's fine now.

358
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,587
All right, don't test my patience!
Who are you?

359
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,921
Let's go, Chan Chat!

360
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,131
Chan Sum? It's you?

361
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,090
Let's go!

362
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,718
Don't pull me! I can walk on my own!

363
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:17,013
Chief, I suspect
the Thief Catcher you hired is the one

364
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,514
behind this incident today.

365
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,391
<i>How do you know?</i>

366
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:23,186
Ask her to bring the baby back at once.

367
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,531
Call the doctor.

368
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:40,620
How's the baby?

369
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,246
-Save him.
-You can count on me.

370
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:43,706
To the emergency ward!

371
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:57,220
PEOPLE'S HOSPITAL

372
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,495
Doctor, how's the baby?

373
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:25,706
I'm sorry, it's too late.
I couldn't save him.

374
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:10,793
Call his parents.

375
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:11,836
Yes, sir.

376
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:18,426
Ching-ching, don't go!

377
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,845
Our master hates idiots like me.

378
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,014
I'll miss you.

379
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,141
Take care of yourself.

380
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,102
Don't cry.

381
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,522
Ching-ching!

382
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,607
Let her go!

383
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,444
Kneel down.

384
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:39,697
Tung-tung.

385
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,324
You must stay here

386
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:45,453
and fulfill the fate you
and your martial sister shared alone.

387
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,955
You're going to uphold justice for me

388
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,540
on your own.

389
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,476
Tung-tung, why are you crying?

390
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,977
No, I'm not.

391
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,356
Tell me why.

392
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,483
It's nothing.

393
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,194
How's the case today?

394
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:24,200
The missing baby fell to his death.

395
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:39,090
It has been ten years. You're still great.

396
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,801
Where did that monster
get an invisible robe?

397
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,178
He's behind all this.

398
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,680
Are you going to interfere?

399
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,431
No, thank you.

400
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,393
When I escaped from that cave,

401
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,853
you spared me
even though you've already caught me.

402
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,772
Now I'm taking good care of myself.

403
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,358
What does he want so many babies for?

404
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,653
He'll choose one to be the emperor
in the next eclipse.

405
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,238
And the rest

406
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,115
will become his killers like us?

407
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,450
Moreover, Master would even
turn them into Chan Gau.

408
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,412
Chan Sum, do them a favor.

409
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,038
Just kill the babies.

410
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,873
That monster has corrupted me
for three years.

411
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:13,874
After I had escaped,

412
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,418
I've spent ten years

413
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,169
to return to normal!

414
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,297
I don't want the babies
to become monsters.

415
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,716
Just pretend that you know nothing
and leave them alone.

416
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,509
If Master gives the order,

417
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:24,969
I'd kill you as well.

418
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,595
Do it then!

419
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,184
You won't be so lucky next time!

420
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:38,024
Now that you've told me everything,
how can I feign ignorance?

421
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,002
You won't be called Ching-ching anymore.

422
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:01,130
From now on, you are Chan Sum!

423
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:17,688
<i>You must get
the invisible robe in ten days</i>

424
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,274
<i>and kill the professor after that.</i>

425
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,110
<i>Do it or you'll die.</i>

426
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,955
Hey, what are you doing?

427
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,338
I've told you many times.

428
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:45,549
It's dangerous here. Leave, please!

429
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,552
What's so dangerous? You're always here.

430
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:51,430
Are you keeping something from me?

431
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,727
You already know everything.

432
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,687
You said the robe is mine too,

433
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,273
but I didn't know it can stand UV light.

434
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,359
No, it still can't.

435
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,986
You'll be the first one to know if it can.

436
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,782
What have you been working on
these past few days then?

437
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,829
I'm working on this Revival Box.

438
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,417
These were dead before,

439
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,377
but they are alive again.

440
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,092
Do they have any flowers?

441
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,136
Yes. They will bloom in a month.

442
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:35,891
Sum-ching.

443
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:41,105
Will you put them under the sun every day

444
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,356
and water them at night?

445
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:48,279
You taught me
how to make these lucky stars.

446
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,488
You'll see them bloom.

447
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:59,790
<i>You must get
the invisible robe in ten days</i>

448
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,376
<i>and kill the professor after that.</i>

449
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,795
<i>Do it or you'll die.</i>

450
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:10,134
Hey! Your men kept me for over two hours!

451
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,178
Don't blame me. It was an accident!

452
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,137
Accident?

453
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,847
The baby died because of you!

454
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,807
What? I didn't drop him!

455
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,893
It's Wonder Woman's fault
that she couldn't save him!

456
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:19,977
You may go now,

457
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,937
but you can't deceive yourself.

458
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,773
Hey! Enough!

459
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,610
Stop making me the scapegoat!

460
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,863
Fine, it's my loss.
I'll keep an eye on it.

461
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:35,034
Keep an extra eye on my son, miss.

462
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,913
-Don't worry, I'll help my client.
-Thank you!

463
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,831
I'm just asking for trouble!

464
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,773
Done.

465
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,614
Why are there so many birdcages?

466
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,305
This is bad! That monster is here!

467
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,501
Hey!

468
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,504
Hey!

469
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,852
I still got hit!

470
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,778
Let's see how long you can stand it.

471
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,617
Do you know

472
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,536
who the intruder was?

473
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,621
No.

474
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,290
I have someone in mind,

475
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:50,544
but she should have died ten years ago.

476
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,545
Yes.

477
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,006
I killed Chan Chat myself.

478
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:57,384
Now, only Wonder Woman
could get in by herself.

479
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,721
She has been meddling with our plan.

480
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,056
She's probably the intruder.

481
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,099
Let me kill her, Master.

482
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,561
Leave it to the others.

483
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,104
Chan Gau.

484
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,274
Kill the woman.

485
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:13,651
And if necessary,

486
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,486
die with her.

487
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,963
You damned monster.

488
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,091
I won't let the needles go up to my head.

489
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,159
We proved that this case is unrelated

490
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,619
to the previous incidents.

491
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:06,662
We promised the mayor

492
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,831
it wouldn't happen again.

493
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,500
Here's your deposit!

494
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,836
-What deposit?
-I'm not pursuing your son's case!

495
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:14,795
Hey!

496
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,089
We'll talk later. I'm in a meeting.

497
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:18,173
No!

498
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,216
The deal is off!

499
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,467
Miss.

500
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:24,221
You must have gotten hold of something.
Please tell us for the babies' sake.

501
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:25,973
What good would it do to me?

502
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,767
You won't hire me if you can handle it.

503
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,061
-For justice, you should--
-To hell with justice!

504
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,105
I almost got killed!

505
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,175
You killed the baby!

506
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,555
Tell me what you know.

507
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,348
Do you think I'd listen to you?

508
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,058
You will.

509
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,518
When that baby is falling down,

510
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,145
you saved it without a second thought.

511
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,093
Yes, I killed the baby.

512
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:47,888
But I'm dying too.

513
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,724
We are even now!

514
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,728
Won't you leave me alone?

515
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:57,564
I only want to die in peace!

516
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:01,026
I want to know who took the babies.

517
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,529
Don't hurt the Invisible Woman!

518
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:07,157
She's only a puppet.

519
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:08,659
That damned monster!

520
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:11,537
I won't let his needles kill me.

521
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,038
Don't do that!

522
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,334
Go away before I lose my mind.

523
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:20,462
I'm not leaving.

524
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,339
You'll die!

525
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,551
It's fine to die for a good reason.

526
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,057
I can stop the needles from going further,

527
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,308
but I can't get them out.

528
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:39,606
Okay, I'll use the time you bought me
to get the babies back.

529
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,066
If we succeed,

530
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:43,360
-we must get Chan Sum to help us.
-The Invisible Woman?

531
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:44,695
Yes.

532
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:47,614
Before I find her, we must be careful.

533
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:51,743
That monster discovered me
when I sneaked into his cave last time.

534
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,120
He thought it was you.

535
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,913
So he is sending Chan Gau to kill you now.

536
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,809
<i>Officer Lau, a madman is holding hostage</i>

537
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,185
<i>dozens of people in the station</i>

538
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,937
<i>and destroyed
the station's computer system.</i>

539
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,606
<i>A cargo train is charging</i>

540
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:21,648
<i>toward the station now.</i>

541
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,734
When will it hit the station?

542
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:24,860
<i>In about five minutes.</i>

543
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,278
Got it.

544
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,090
All units, get ready!

545
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,599
Be careful of the land mines!

546
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,645
Don't step on them!

547
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:04,733
Don't move!

548
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,488
Be careful! There are land mines!

549
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:10,906
Watch out!

550
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:20,957
Go now!

551
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,251
The train will crash in one minute.

552
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:24,378
Go in there!

553
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,505
Save the hostages inside first.

554
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,054
Why aren't you going in?

555
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,998
Run!

556
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,447
Brace yourself!

557
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,118
Leave it to me!

558
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,991
Run!

559
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:20,160
Sir, how can we stop the train?

560
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,078
The madman has destroyed the computer!

561
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,955
It can't be stopped. Go quickly!

562
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,878
LEI HO
CHEK FUNG

563
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:39,971
Run! The train is here!

564
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,128
Take it!

565
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:19,302
Let's go!

566
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,594
Dear.

567
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,766
What did the doctor say?

568
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,353
If you're lucky,

569
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,606
you can walk in six months.

570
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:13,773
Otherwise?

571
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,569
Otherwise,

572
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,865
you may become a cripple.

573
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,536
Cheer up.

574
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,623
As Wonder Woman's husband,

575
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:32,042
I'll always stand by you.

576
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:34,794
When did you find out?

577
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,631
At the station,

578
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:40,258
when you looked at me,

579
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,969
unwilling to go in.

580
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:52,771
No more secret smiles from now on

581
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,191
and no more secret tears.

582
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,986
Just tell me everything.

583
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,371
Okay?

584
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:15,460
Dear.

585
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,500
Hey! There's a flower bud--

586
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,263
What's wrong? Sit down first.

587
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:11,558
No, I just got a clue.

588
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,685
I must write it down now!

589
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:15,562
Sit down first.

590
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:17,147
Leave now!

591
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,079
How long have you known about it?

592
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,540
I've always known about it.

593
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,793
In the process,

594
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:42,255
I found that the invisible robe
emits toxins.

595
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:45,800
That's why I always tell you
to stay out of here.

596
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:49,137
But a flower bud has grown.

597
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:53,516
I'll be okay if the flowers can be saved.

598
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,269
Come on, get out of here.

599
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:58,063
We are partners.

600
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,981
How can I leave you like this?

601
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:06,196
Where are my glasses?

602
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,489
You're wearing them.

603
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,249
Before the robe is finished,

604
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,418
I will not die.

605
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:25,173
I can still smell the fragrance
in your hair.

606
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,039
Let's look at the flowers outside.

607
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:11,136
I'll be fine.

608
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:12,679
Get out of here!

609
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:23,231
Let me in!

610
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,902
I won't go out even if you can get in.

611
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:35,869
The robe will be ready
when the flowers bloom.

612
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:38,997
You promised
to take care of them until then.

613
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,498
Have you forgotten about that?

614
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:53,303
Chan Sum.

615
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,681
Why are you still meeting that monster?

616
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,476
He won't let the professor live anyway.

617
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,604
He'll kill him once the robe is finished!

618
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:04,272
How many needles were you attacked with?

619
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,693
If you help us,

620
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:11,112
Wonder Woman and I
may stand a chance to kill him.

621
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,509
If you fear death so much,

622
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,052
how can you help Wonder Woman?

623
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,262
I won't thank you.

624
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,514
You saved my life.

625
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:40,058
But to protect the professor,

626
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:41,476
you let that monster control you.

627
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,144
You have harmed so many babies.

628
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:47,315
You can deceive others but not yourself.

629
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:49,609
Wonder Woman can help you now.

630
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,653
I'll see you at the same spot tomorrow.

631
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,238
I'll wait until you come!

632
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:57,909
You'd better come.

633
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:08,545
I don't have time. Please hurry.

634
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:14,926
I did it!

635
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:18,054
Sum-ching!

636
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:19,681
Sum-ching!

637
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:31,317
Lucky star.

638
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,361
Sum-ching, the invisible robe
is finally finished.

639
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:43,830
Why haven't you gotten that robe?

640
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:47,792
It can't work under the sun yet.

641
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:50,378
The strength of the Emperor's army
will be reduced.

642
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:52,880
It'll soon be finished.

643
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:55,592
Give the professor a few more days.

644
00:59:56,676 --> 01:00:00,138
Get it no matter what

645
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:02,682
before sunset tomorrow.

646
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:05,226
Chan Gau will help you then.

647
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:09,939
Master, all my work in your great plan

648
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,357
are inconsequential.

649
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:16,279
If I find an emperor among those babies,

650
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:18,948
you'll be honored for your services.

651
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:32,045
All princes should be asleep.

652
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:35,214
You should go to sleep too.

653
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:46,351
September 18th.

654
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:50,063
Today,

655
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:54,984
I've finally solved the UV light problem.

656
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:03,451
But I've also reached
the end of my life too.

657
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:06,412
<i>From the first day when
I started working on the invisible robe,</i>

658
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,166
<i>I knew I would die from the toxins.</i>

659
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:13,711
<i>Without Sum-ching,</i>

660
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:16,673
<i>I wouldn't have been able to face it.</i>

661
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:22,011
<i>If she knows that my only hope now</i>

662
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,514
<i>is to take her hands</i>

663
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:26,891
<i>and witness the flowers bloom,</i>

664
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:30,269
<i>will she still kill me?</i>

665
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:34,732
The day has come.

666
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:38,736
Regardless of the progress,

667
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,281
get the invisible robe

668
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:48,579
and kill the professor.

669
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:02,176
TELEPHONE BOOTH

670
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:06,097
Professor, I'll never return to you.

671
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,892
<i>I won't leave until I see you.</i>

672
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:11,602
Believe me.

673
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:14,522
You are in great danger.

674
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:16,023
Leave the lab now.

675
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:22,071
Damn it!

676
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,614
Even Wonder Woman is late.

677
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:27,910
I shouldn't have promised to come.

678
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,495
Should I leave or not?

679
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:42,884
Great. There you are.

680
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:44,677
Master sent me to kill you.

681
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,347
Wait, Chan Sum.

682
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,808
I won't let you go this time.

683
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,352
Can you really do it?

684
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:56,397
I must execute Master's order.

685
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:58,107
But I can promise you

686
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:00,193
that I'll do you a favor after you die.

687
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:03,738
Wait, it might be you who'll die.

688
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:06,032
Tell me your last wish. Tell me!

689
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:09,660
-Take care of the professor.
-The professor?

690
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:29,055
Save the professor for me.

691
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:41,025
Chan Sum, what are you doing?

692
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:43,820
She didn't come to kill you.
She came to kill herself.

693
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,405
You are giving up your life to save him?

694
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:47,448
My life?

695
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:50,701
I am just Master's killing machine.

696
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:53,579
A machine won't have feelings

697
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,581
or sacrifice themselves for someone.

698
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:06,884
Life is meaningful

699
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:09,387
if you can face yourself.

700
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:13,015
Not just myself,
but I can't even face him!

701
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,852
Chan Sum!

702
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:21,649
So you're all leaving?

703
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:25,444
Damn, can't you stay put?

704
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:27,363
My own bike is better.

705
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:30,783
Wait for me!

706
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:37,164
Chan Sum!

707
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:39,542
You can change yourself from now on!

708
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,919
So what? I'm still Chan Sum!

709
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:43,838
You can be another Chan Chat!

710
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:46,924
It's too late! Leave me alone!

711
01:04:52,513 --> 01:04:55,182
Shit! Even a bike can't catch up?

712
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:56,225
Go!

713
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,065
You've shunned your past.

714
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:05,192
This is your true self!

715
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,652
I shouldn't live then!

716
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:11,449
No!

717
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:26,422
This is bad!

718
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:33,095
You two are in great trouble!

719
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:35,806
So lucky. Brace yourselves!

720
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:52,114
Tung-tung?

721
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:54,158
Ching-ching?

722
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:56,577
Let go of my hand

723
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:58,996
or we'll both fall!

724
01:05:59,080 --> 01:05:59,997
No!

725
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,168
Grab it!

726
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:09,924
I can't hold on any longer!

727
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,136
I won't let go!

728
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,805
We must be together.

729
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:18,307
It's really you.

730
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:20,893
You two knew each other?

731
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:27,108
-I don't remember.
-The past is trivial.

732
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:29,694
What matters is
the thing you wish to do now.

733
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:33,364
Hey! What do you want to do?

734
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:36,867
Master sent Chan Gau
to kill the professor.

735
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:38,494
I want to save him.

736
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:39,537
The professor?

737
01:07:11,318 --> 01:07:12,236
Give it to me.

738
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:45,644
The invisible robe
can withstand UV light now.

739
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:47,021
Nobody can find it.

740
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,691
No!

741
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:56,489
Sum-ching.

742
01:07:57,782 --> 01:07:59,533
I have so much to tell you.

743
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:02,453
It's all inside the gift box.

744
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,552
It doesn't matter how hard you hit him.

745
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:20,763
He'll stick to what he wants.

746
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:22,014
No!

747
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:29,188
You can't give it to him.

748
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:30,564
I have lost everything.

749
01:08:31,148 --> 01:08:32,358
I can't let him die.

750
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:52,253
I'm sorry.

751
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:56,590
I knew Master can't make you kill me.

752
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:15,025
It won't be that easy!

753
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,577
Wait, hold on!

754
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:54,607
Idiot, here's the tape.

755
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,859
Come and get it!

756
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:07,369
Goodbye!

757
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:10,831
It's too hot here!

758
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:40,778
Sum-ching, it's better
to have it destroyed

759
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:43,072
than to let him have it.

760
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:44,323
Hey! Let's go!

761
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:51,830
Go ahead.

762
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:53,916
-What about--
-Let her be.

763
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:57,127
Where are we going?

764
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:59,129
To save the babies from the cave.

765
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:02,758
Just the two of us?
Let me get my stuff first.

766
01:11:06,303 --> 01:11:09,890
May I look at the blooming flowers?

767
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:56,812
All the babies are here.

768
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:58,188
Don't touch anything.

769
01:11:58,272 --> 01:12:00,816
The babies will die if we fight here.

770
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,716
You damned monster, come on and die!

771
01:12:25,799 --> 01:12:27,593
Beware. This place is full of methane.

772
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:36,769
You damned monster like methane
more than oxygen.

773
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:38,020
I'll kill you.

774
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:44,735
How dare you come here!

775
01:12:44,818 --> 01:12:45,986
Attack her!

776
01:12:49,406 --> 01:12:50,491
Special powers?

777
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:10,844
You are kneeling to him now?
Weren't you bold before?

778
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:13,847
I can't help it.

779
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:15,641
My legs feel like jelly.

780
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:18,185
Do you think someone like you can beat me?

781
01:13:18,268 --> 01:13:21,188
It's no use kneeling to me. Guards, go!

782
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:22,439
-Yes!
-Yes!

783
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:23,565
We have no way out now.

784
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:25,692
Deal with Master, I'll handle the others.

785
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,403
Go!

786
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,778
It's an honor to die by my hands.

787
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:12,322
Damn it. I think I'm high on methane.

788
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:14,324
What should we do? We can't beat him.

789
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:16,118
Don't let him concentrate. Go!

790
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,037
I'll kill you this time.

791
01:14:39,683 --> 01:14:41,685
Tung-tung, go with Chan Chat!

792
01:14:41,768 --> 01:14:43,687
-No, I'll fight until the end!
-No!

793
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:46,648
You'll be poisoned if you stay.

794
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:48,066
Let's go!

795
01:14:55,616 --> 01:14:57,493
I'll need some oxygen.

796
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:22,684
Go to hell, all of you!

797
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:51,213
He must have been
blown up to pieces this time.

798
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:56,927
Why is this one so late? He's still alive!

799
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:18,115
Damn you!

800
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:25,289
He's afraid of lights.

801
01:16:25,372 --> 01:16:26,582
Give me some more.

802
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:26,433
Is my face still pretty?

803
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:29,603
What?

804
01:17:29,686 --> 01:17:31,104
I don't know if you're fine or not,

805
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:32,564
but you scared me to death!

806
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:50,582
He's still alive?

807
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:18,360
How is this possible?

808
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:19,736
We destroyed his body,

809
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,780
but his mind is still there.

810
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,265
He has gained control over me!

811
01:18:49,307 --> 01:18:50,600
Let me help you.

812
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:52,060
Don't come near me!

813
01:18:57,649 --> 01:18:59,109
I can't control myself!

814
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:06,199
Go. Quick!

815
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:08,577
Go with Chan Chat!

816
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:39,691
-What should we do?
-Go!

817
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:57,501
Ching-ching!

818
01:19:57,584 --> 01:20:00,378
Don't let me do it again!

819
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:03,006
Fuck you!

820
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:05,300
Die!

821
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:08,303
Go!

822
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,265
You son of a bitch!

823
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:33,370
He's controlling my body, go!

824
01:20:33,453 --> 01:20:35,580
We won't leave you behind!

825
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:37,791
I'm happy to have met you again!

826
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:41,211
I'm sorry!

827
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:44,256
Chan Sum!

828
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:48,844
-Chan Sum!
-Ching-ching!

829
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:52,931
I'll die with you, damned monster!

830
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:59,187
<i>China must have an emperor.</i>

831
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:07,195
<i>China must have an emperor.</i>

832
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:09,197
<i>What's important is today, not the past.</i>

833
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:12,909
<i>China must have an emperor!</i>

834
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:16,746
<i>China must have an emperor!</i>

835
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:25,380
<i>Can we see the blooming flowers together?</i>

836
01:21:25,463 --> 01:21:28,425
Professor!

837
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:57,370
Ching-ching.

838
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:01,583
You won't die.

839
01:22:03,668 --> 01:22:05,295
Hey!

840
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:07,589
Get on the ground before you talk.

841
01:22:07,672 --> 01:22:09,382
Otherwise, I'll die!

842
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:18,975
Are you okay?

843
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:21,561
Where's Chan Chat?

844
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:25,065
I got something good!

845
01:22:25,148 --> 01:22:27,984
Take one, or when the press comes,

846
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:30,070
we'll look shabby!

847
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:32,530
Come on, put them on!

848
01:23:04,437 --> 01:23:06,606
<i>The police have solved</i>

849
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:08,441
<i>the missing babies case.</i>

850
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:11,736
<i>Most of the missing babies
have been found.</i>

851
01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:14,823
<i>Here's our live report.</i>

852
01:23:14,906 --> 01:23:16,116
<i>We heard that</i>

853
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:17,993
<i>three unknown heroines solved it.</i>

854
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:20,495
<i>How are they related to the police?</i>

855
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:23,331
<i>They are close friends of the police.</i>

856
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:24,708
<i>Who are they?</i>

857
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:25,875
<i>No comment.</i>

858
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:28,837
<i>When will they come again?</i>

859
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,089
<i>When we need them.</i>

860
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:33,550
<i>Do you know their names?</i>

861
01:23:33,633 --> 01:23:35,844
<i>-Their names?
-Yes, their names.</i>

862
01:23:36,636 --> 01:23:38,138
<i>They are called The Heroic Trio.</i>

863
01:23:38,221 --> 01:23:39,556
<i>-The Heroic Trio?
-The Heroic Trio?</i>

864
01:23:39,639 --> 01:23:42,308
-When did we get that name?
<i>-How do you know that?</i>

865
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:45,353
-Where does the name come from?
<i>-It's top-secret, I'm sorry.</i>

866
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:46,771
I was just improvising it a bit.
