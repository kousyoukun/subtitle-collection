00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:27,479
<i>One, then another and another</i>
<i>We meet and we go through hard times</i>

2
00:00:27,887 --> 00:00:34,520
<i>With feeling and passion, with emotion</i>
<i>We pass stop after stop in our lives</i>

3
00:00:35,087 --> 00:00:38,045
<i>One turn, one bend of the road</i>
<i>It's just me</i>

4
00:00:38,127 --> 00:00:42,359
<i>A look backwards, a life</i>
<i>A moment in time</i>

5
00:00:42,447 --> 00:00:45,439
<i>Each move, each action is only</i>

6
00:00:45,527 --> 00:00:49,361
<i>Something trivial, something difficult</i>
<i>It gets turned into a legend</i>

7
00:00:49,447 --> 00:00:56,239
<i>With you, with me, with anyone</i>
<i>With sadness also comes romance</i>

00:00:56,927 --> 00:00:59,964
<i>Night after day after night</i>

9
00:01:00,047 --> 00:01:03,596
<i>Dreams are interspersed</i>
<i>With complexities</i>

10
00:01:04,127 --> 00:01:06,925
<i>One turn, one bend of the road</i>
<i>It's just me</i>

00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:10,966
<i>A look backwards, a life</i>

<i>Each move, each action is only</i>

13
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:18,559
<i>Something trivial, something difficult</i>
<i>It gets turned into a legend</i>

14
00:01:18,647 --> 00:01:22,196
<i>Don't ask about the past</i>
<i>I was sad, I was happy, be with me</i>

15
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:25,438
<i>With each step, walking in fear</i>
<i>I go my way</i>

16
00:01:25,527 --> 00:01:28,087
The disappearances of babies
has shocked the city.

17
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:32,524
Within three months,
18 babies have been kidnapped.

18
00:01:32,607 --> 00:01:36,805
The police have not yet had any
breakthroughs nor made any progress.

19
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:39,082
According to the
Commissioner of Police...

20
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:44,922
Please stop here.
Ah. I leap forward.

21
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:47,237
There's something wrong. Hey.

22
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:51,837
I'm in trouble.
Come on.

23
00:01:51,927 --> 00:01:54,521
Be careful, be careful.

24
00:01:54,607 --> 00:01:59,476
See. Super elegant architecture.
Please go in and take a look.

25
00:02:00,527 --> 00:02:03,837
Please come with me. See?

26
00:02:03,927 --> 00:02:06,316
See? This house is elegantly laid out.

27
00:02:06,407 --> 00:02:10,605
I guarantee there will be no one around
within a one kilometre radius.

28
00:02:10,687 --> 00:02:13,838
And it's only a five-minute drive
to the market.

29
00:02:13,927 --> 00:02:16,805
If this house has so many good points,
it must have defects too.

30
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,720
Of course. But they don't affect
the overall quality.

31
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:26,084
The minor problem is that
it has not really been renovated.

32
00:02:29,727 --> 00:02:31,718
Is this what you call
a slight lack of renovation?

33
00:02:31,807 --> 00:02:35,038
There is no problem. It's structurally
sound. It had a minor fire, that's all.

34
00:02:41,647 --> 00:02:43,638
Let me show you something.

35
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:49,402
Birdsong and fragrant flowers.

36
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:56,484
I bet you the longer you live here,
the more you'll love it.

37
00:02:57,767 --> 00:03:00,281
- What do you think?
- Darn.

38
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:02,835
I told the owner to fix up the house
before selling it.

39
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:05,600
Now I've just wasted my time.
Really.

40
00:03:07,327 --> 00:03:09,318
Lucky me.

41
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:13,286
Who do you think is going to buy
this house now? I'm so pissed off.

42
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:15,403
- Let's go.
- Don't move.

43
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:19,605
Hubby. Let's buy it.
I like this house, it's got character.

44
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:22,485
Character? Really?

45
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:25,127
- You know how I like my house to be.
- Yeah, I know.

46
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:28,800
- Then put down a little deposit.
- Be quiet.

47
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:53,882
- Want to steal my car? Cuff yourself.
- I'll cuff myself.

48
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,435
Wow. He's so cool.

49
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:59,280
Of course, my hubby is a cop.

50
00:04:01,647 --> 00:04:05,117
- Let's go. What are you doing?
- I'm walking.

51
00:04:05,207 --> 00:04:07,596
To date, 18 babies have gone missing
in the past two months.

52
00:04:07,687 --> 00:04:11,566
From the pattern of the crimes, it looks
like the work of the same person.

53
00:04:11,647 --> 00:04:16,402
So far, none of the families
have received any ransom notes.

54
00:04:16,487 --> 00:04:19,877
No political or terrorist groups have
claimed responsibility for the acts.

55
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:24,677
This case is so strange, do you think
we should approach the Super Heroine?

56
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:30,717
Although she's approached us to help
before, we don't even know who she is.

57
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:33,241
There is no way to contact her.

58
00:04:33,327 --> 00:04:35,557
Because all the missing babies
are male

59
00:04:35,647 --> 00:04:38,764
I believe they are not simply
seeking money.

60
00:04:38,847 --> 00:04:41,281
- THE NEXT ONE...
- Hey, hey...

61
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:43,597
It may have
something to do with evil cults.

62
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:54,961
Hey. Let's check that out.

63
00:05:03,127 --> 00:05:05,595
- Did you see someone run out here?
- I didn't notice anything.

64
00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:09,238
Commissioner.

65
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:16,405
THE NEXT ONE WlLL BE YOUR SON.

66
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:31,678
Here, come with me.

67
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,880
The stairs are here,
and that's the operating room.

68
00:05:38,927 --> 00:05:41,361
- Hey, that way.
- I'm really worried about my son.

69
00:05:41,447 --> 00:05:43,438
Why don't we take him home now?

70
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:46,041
Lau.
Our son was just born this morning.

71
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:48,482
The doctor won't be responsible
if we take him home.

72
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:50,558
- Lau.
- Fine. Leave him here then.

73
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:52,956
Then why don't you ask
the Super Heroine to help us?

74
00:05:53,047 --> 00:05:55,356
Madame, I can't get in touch with her.

75
00:05:55,447 --> 00:05:57,677
I've already assigned many people
to be on duty here.

76
00:05:57,767 --> 00:06:01,316
lf something did happen to your baby,
it'd be the same here as at home.

77
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:03,398
- What? Look after my wife.
- I understand.

78
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:05,921
There's just been an accident
involving a bus.

79
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:09,044
The hospital says we might
have to use the beds in this wing.

80
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:11,516
Lau. Please give us a moment.

81
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:18,601
Lau, they only want my son.

82
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:23,322
Do you think we can maybe
switch the babies?

83
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:25,159
Use whose son?

84
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:27,636
Well, Switching the babies
wouldn't be right.

85
00:06:27,727 --> 00:06:30,764
They want your son. lf you switch
the babies, they'll still find him.

86
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:34,522
That's true. And if people found out,
that would be embarrassing.

87
00:06:35,287 --> 00:06:37,721
- You have to stay strong.
- Yeah.

88
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:39,798
Strength.

89
00:06:41,287 --> 00:06:45,075
Madame, I'm sorry, lnspector Lau says
no one may enter without his permission.

90
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:47,158
Forget it.

91
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:26,000
Look up.

92
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:29,397
- What's happening? The police are here.
- What's going on?

93
00:07:29,487 --> 00:07:32,797
Hey, they're falling.
Catch them.

94
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:35,355
- My son. My babe.
- Catch our son.

95
00:07:35,447 --> 00:07:38,883
- Which one is our son?
- Just catch either one of them.

96
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:41,037
Which one is it?

97
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:06,318
Wow.

98
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,164
It's the Super Heroine.

99
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:13,122
See, it's the Super Heroine.

100
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:16,919
He left some blood up there,
take it away to be analysed.

101
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:29,037
- This isn't ours. This isn't ours.
- What?

102
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:32,118
You're right. It's a girl.

103
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:35,199
What? That's a girl?
She is my daughter.

104
00:09:35,287 --> 00:09:37,755
- Hey, hey...
- I'm so glad nothing happened to you.

105
00:09:37,847 --> 00:09:40,520
- I was so scared.
- Hey.

106
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,598
Get a swab of the blood
and have it analysed.

107
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:44,678
Yes, lnspector Lau.

108
00:09:50,607 --> 00:09:53,599
- Hello?
- Another baby has disappeared.

109
00:09:53,687 --> 00:09:56,281
- I have a lot to do, I'll be back late.
- OK.

110
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:59,484
- Are you upset?
- No, do your best, OK?

111
00:11:32,447 --> 00:11:35,484
You're always looking for a fight.
Next time I'll cut your head off.

112
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:37,558
Guard the door.

113
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,996
My Lord, I've brought back
the baby boy you wanted.

114
00:12:18,527 --> 00:12:22,440
Take the 19th prince inside.

115
00:12:22,527 --> 00:12:25,485
Allow him to rest alongside
the other princes.

116
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:27,125
Yes, my Lord.

117
00:12:27,207 --> 00:12:34,158
Saam,
your heart is beating too fast.

118
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:35,805
No.

119
00:12:35,887 --> 00:12:41,723
You have no need of your memory, and
you certainly can't have any feelings.

120
00:12:41,807 --> 00:12:43,798
I don't have any.

121
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:47,004
When the next auspicious day
comes around,

122
00:12:47,087 --> 00:12:51,126
I'll select one of them
to become the emperor.

123
00:12:51,207 --> 00:12:54,085
China must have an emperor.

124
00:12:56,647 --> 00:13:01,675
China must have an emperor.

125
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:05,282
China must have an emperor.

126
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,484
China must have an emperor.

127
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:31,800
Either you climb back up by yourself, or
else you can fall. No one can help you.

128
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:33,957
Climb.

129
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:37,357
Ching Ching, climb. Climb.

130
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:42,122
Don't fall.

131
00:13:42,207 --> 00:13:44,198
Climb.

132
00:14:35,687 --> 00:14:40,761
- Are you OK? Another nightmare?
- Can I come in?

133
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:45,716
The equipment is on. You know I don't
want anyone to come in to disturb me.

134
00:14:45,807 --> 00:14:49,482
For the past few years, every night
I've dreamt of the invisibility suit.

135
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:53,276
Last night, I even dreamed that it could
disappear under daylight.

136
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:55,835
Has the suit been locked in the vault
the whole time?

137
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:59,124
- Yes. Why?
- Nothing.

138
00:14:59,207 --> 00:15:02,995
The police called today and asked me how
someone could turn invisible.

139
00:15:03,087 --> 00:15:05,078
They wanted my opinion.

140
00:15:08,687 --> 00:15:12,475
You don't want anyone to know about the
invisibility suit before it's finished.

141
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:16,526
Even if it's perfected, I still don't
want anyone to know about it,

142
00:15:16,607 --> 00:15:20,919
because an invention like this can
easily be misused as a weapon of war.

143
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:24,399
Then what's the meaning behind
the research into the invisibility suit?

144
00:15:24,487 --> 00:15:29,322
I'm happiest when I'm concentrating
on a specific research project.

145
00:15:30,127 --> 00:15:32,163
Aren't you afraid
I would steal your suit?

146
00:15:32,247 --> 00:15:35,717
No. Why would a person
steal from one's self?

147
00:15:37,647 --> 00:15:40,844
- Do you want any coffee?
- OK.

148
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:25,918
FORTUNE TELLER

149
00:16:40,527 --> 00:16:45,282
Miss, the birthdays
of the 18 babies you gave me...

150
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:48,484
- Are they related?
- It's strange.

151
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:50,558
They're destined to be royals.

152
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:53,559
Left cheekbones, right brows. They're
destined to a life of an emperor.

153
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:57,162
Emperor? Who'd take so many children
destined to live like an emperor?

154
00:17:20,487 --> 00:17:22,637
Wow.

155
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:34,118
Do you want to eat this?

156
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,402
If you want to eat, then come over.

157
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:47,517
Come on.

158
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,725
Come on.

159
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:57,838
Are you talking to me?

160
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:03,518
No.

161
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:14,763
Older sister, can I give you a kiss?

162
00:18:14,847 --> 00:18:16,838
OK.

163
00:18:21,887 --> 00:18:25,562
- What are you smiling about?
- Smiling? Nothing.

164
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:33,520
AOTA CHEMlCALS

165
00:18:39,727 --> 00:18:41,683
- Get down.
- OK.

166
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:43,598
- Step to one side. Hurry up.
- Move it.

167
00:18:48,487 --> 00:18:50,637
What a calamity.
Who are these people?

168
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:52,718
Three armed robbers
with criminal records.

169
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:55,719
They just robbed a security van.
We chased them into the factory.

170
00:18:55,807 --> 00:18:58,162
They have eight hostages,
including the driver and guard.

171
00:18:58,247 --> 00:19:00,636
- What are we going to do?
- We're going to force them out.

172
00:19:00,727 --> 00:19:02,718
- Give me one.
- Get ready.

173
00:19:07,487 --> 00:19:08,886
Ready!

174
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:10,958
Fire.

175
00:19:14,207 --> 00:19:17,358
Don't be afraid. lt's only tear gas.
Wear your masks.

176
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:24,043
Get out there. Go out there.

177
00:19:26,087 --> 00:19:28,078
Give me a pistol.

178
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:34,358
- Hold your fire.
- Listen up.

179
00:19:34,447 --> 00:19:39,123
There are many more hostages inside. You
have two hours to get us a helicopter.

180
00:19:39,207 --> 00:19:42,517
Or else I'll kill a hostage
every five minutes.

181
00:20:04,207 --> 00:20:07,597
Hello, policemen.
Good morning, everybody.

182
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:10,724
- Who is she?
- The sharpshooter, Seventh Chan.

183
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:13,082
Hey, policeman.
Don't talk about me like that.

184
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:16,239
I only kill shits who deserve to die.
Call me a bounty hunter.

185
00:20:16,327 --> 00:20:18,397
We won't pay to hire someone like you.

186
00:20:18,487 --> 00:20:24,835
Money? Sirs, I'll do you a favour
this time. I'll do it for free.

187
00:21:08,407 --> 00:21:10,398
Arrest them.

188
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:16,320
- I surrender. Don't shoot.
- Don't shoot.

189
00:21:16,407 --> 00:21:18,398
I surrender.

190
00:21:19,327 --> 00:21:21,318
- Let's rescue the hostages.
- The hostages.

191
00:21:21,407 --> 00:21:23,398
Yes, there are the hostages.

192
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:27,956
Get down. Get down.

193
00:21:28,047 --> 00:21:30,117
Take down their witness statements.

194
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:38,601
- Go and see if there are any others.
- Yes. OK.

195
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:52,035
I'm married.

196
00:21:52,127 --> 00:21:56,040
It looks like I'm the one
who'll be able to get your son back.

197
00:21:56,127 --> 00:21:58,766
If I get him back alive,
then you'll pay me HK $500,000.

198
00:21:58,847 --> 00:22:01,042
If he's dead,
then you can pay me HK$ 150,000.

199
00:22:01,127 --> 00:22:03,118
I only take gold.
Here's my phone number.

200
00:22:03,207 --> 00:22:05,562
When you've thought it through, call me.

201
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:31,363
UNKNOWN INFORMANT

DISAPPEAR TONIGHT

DAILY EXPRESS
A CHALLENGE TO THE POLICE

204
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:45,879
MYSTERIOUS PERSON INFORMS
POLICE OF THE TIME OF NEXT CRIME

205
00:22:45,967 --> 00:22:49,277
The media has been used. The informant
isn't here to steal a baby.

206
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:53,883
- Tell everyone to look out for trouble.
- Mrs Lau, you may pass.

207
00:22:53,967 --> 00:22:55,958
ID, please.

208
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:01,358
Why are you here tonight?

209
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:04,996
I volunteered to work here on Monday,
Wednesday and Friday. The lady...

210
00:23:05,087 --> 00:23:07,317
Will only go to physiotherapy
if she sees you, right?

211
00:23:07,407 --> 00:23:09,875
- Just so you know.
- I'm in charge of so much here.

212
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:12,481
I'm afraid I won't be able
to take care of you too. Be careful.

213
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:14,558
You too.

214
00:23:52,087 --> 00:23:55,159
- Did you contact the newspapers?
- Are you a cop?

215
00:23:56,327 --> 00:24:00,002
Let me tell you this, I'm going to
kill all the babies tonight.

216
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,317
What are you doing?

217
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:14,925
Don't.

218
00:24:16,807 --> 00:24:19,685
- If you come any closer, I'll kill her.
- Don't do anything stupid.

219
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:22,600
Put it down, or I'll kill her.

220
00:24:22,807 --> 00:24:25,241
- You let her go first.
- I'll kill her.

221
00:24:25,607 --> 00:24:28,405
- OK, I'll put it down then.
- Go inside.

222
00:24:28,487 --> 00:24:31,877
Go inside.
Or else I'll kill her.

223
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:33,958
Get inside.

224
00:24:34,047 --> 00:24:38,484
Those doctors killed my son, so they're
going to accompany him in death.

225
00:24:38,567 --> 00:24:40,558
I have to kill all the babies.

226
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:43,115
Doctor Wong,
please go to the emergency room.

227
00:24:46,247 --> 00:24:48,397
I have to kill all the babies.

228
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,126
You're bleeding. Wipe it off.

229
00:24:51,207 --> 00:24:53,163
I'm fine.

230
00:24:55,207 --> 00:24:57,880
Hey, do you think we can
break through this door?

231
00:24:57,967 --> 00:25:00,435
That's impossible.
The door is very thick.

232
00:25:01,687 --> 00:25:03,837
Let's give it a go first.

233
00:25:15,687 --> 00:25:17,598
The keys are just outside.

234
00:25:20,527 --> 00:25:22,916
I can almost reach them.

235
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:25,965
Don't be so worried. The mad man
won't come back here soon.

236
00:25:29,247 --> 00:25:33,286
I'm only worried about the children.
Didn't you hear what the mad man said?

237
00:25:34,007 --> 00:25:35,998
Let me give it a try.

238
00:25:55,647 --> 00:25:57,638
Why haven't you left?

239
00:26:10,127 --> 00:26:13,278
Roger that. Stay calm.
Tell me slowly.

240
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:18,445
- There's only one person?
- Yes.

241
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:22,159
You're so late.
Are you new to this job?

242
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:33,118
- Take him out.
- Yes.

243
00:26:34,087 --> 00:26:36,920
Don't move.
Hey, get up. Let's go.

244
00:26:37,007 --> 00:26:39,157
I have to kill all the babies.

245
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:41,317
- I have to kill all the babies.
- Hubby.

246
00:26:42,687 --> 00:26:45,406
- I subdued the mad man already.
- l know.

247
00:26:45,487 --> 00:26:47,682
- Lucky you contacted me.
- So I didn't come for nothing.

248
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:49,837
- Come on.
- Hey.

249
00:26:57,167 --> 00:26:59,158
- Will there be a reward?
- No.

250
00:27:00,007 --> 00:27:03,966
- The lady upstairs is waiting for you.
- I was with her already.

251
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:11,560
You naughty kid. You're covering your
mouth while laughing at me.

252
00:27:13,847 --> 00:27:15,678
Should I wait for you?

253
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,997
No. The real criminal
hasn't even showed up yet.

254
00:27:18,087 --> 00:27:20,476
- What?
- Why are you surprised?

255
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:24,162
You busybody.
I'll take you out for a ride.

256
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:30,438
Let's go.

257
00:27:31,487 --> 00:27:33,955
Calling Inspector Lau,
someone's stealing a baby.

258
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:48,084
Don't shoot.
The baby may be inside that.

259
00:27:51,847 --> 00:27:53,838
Everyone, do not fire your weapons.

260
00:28:00,967 --> 00:28:02,958
I'm leaving.

261
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:05,566
After her.

262
00:28:14,887 --> 00:28:16,878
The bounty hunter.

263
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:18,958
- Hey.
- Be careful.

264
00:28:22,287 --> 00:28:26,280
Busybody. Stop yawning. Don't fall
asleep. There's still more fun to come.

265
00:28:26,367 --> 00:28:28,358
This is cool, huh?

266
00:28:32,007 --> 00:28:34,965
I smoked you out now.
Follow me then.

267
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:56,123
Now, take a nap.

268
00:28:57,727 --> 00:28:59,683
Hm. This can't be.

269
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:03,760
She couldn't follow my trail? How is she
expecting to make a living then?

270
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:17,079
It's sinister of you to not even make
a single sound.

271
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:20,557
- So you're a woman.
- Oh, so you're an old biddy.

272
00:29:24,727 --> 00:29:26,319
Hey.

273
00:29:26,407 --> 00:29:28,318
Hey. See here...

274
00:29:28,407 --> 00:29:30,284
Hey.

275
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:32,358
Hey.

276
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:36,445
Tell me, why did you steal
so many babies?

277
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:39,439
That's enough.
Why are you accusing me?

278
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:42,883
You look so unattainable standing there.
Can you be the Super Heroine?

279
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:45,765
- You're the bounty hunter?
- Don't get in my way.

280
00:29:46,607 --> 00:29:50,236
You dare use a baby as bait just
because you want to claim the bounty?

281
00:29:50,327 --> 00:29:52,887
- That's despicable.
- Hey, that's enough.

282
00:29:56,247 --> 00:29:58,203
Let the baby go first.

283
00:29:58,287 --> 00:30:01,245
Fine, let's see
if you have what it takes.

284
00:30:30,527 --> 00:30:32,677
That was the warm-up,
now this is for real.

285
00:30:39,687 --> 00:30:41,757
Hey, wait a second.

286
00:30:49,567 --> 00:30:51,558
What's going on?

287
00:30:53,607 --> 00:30:55,598
An invisible person?

288
00:30:57,527 --> 00:30:59,518
There's another person here?

289
00:31:20,727 --> 00:31:23,400
That person seems to be on my side.

290
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:33,958
The baby.

291
00:31:41,247 --> 00:31:43,397
Be careful.

292
00:32:01,447 --> 00:32:04,359
Are you OK? Hey.
Wait a second.

293
00:32:04,447 --> 00:32:06,438
Who are you? Hey.

294
00:32:08,407 --> 00:32:10,477
You're fine now.
Be good now. You're fine now.

295
00:32:10,567 --> 00:32:13,684
<i>I watch everyone slowly depart</i>

296
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:17,476
<i>After the ruckus</i>

297
00:32:18,087 --> 00:32:24,276
<i>What's left are</i>
<i>My suddenly fatigued arms</i>

298
00:32:24,367 --> 00:32:26,722
Hey, that's enough.
Don't try my patience.

299
00:32:26,807 --> 00:32:29,116
- Who are you?
- Let's go, Seventh Chan.

300
00:32:29,207 --> 00:32:31,198
- So it was you, Third Chan.
- Let's go.

301
00:32:31,287 --> 00:32:33,562
Hey, don't pull. I can walk by myself.

302
00:32:33,647 --> 00:32:37,435
I suspect the bounty hunter you hired
was responsible for what happened.

303
00:32:37,527 --> 00:32:40,087
What? How do you know that?

304
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,886
Tell her to immediately bring
the baby back to the hospital.

305
00:32:42,967 --> 00:32:47,882
<i>Alone in the world</i>
<i>My pain for all to see</i>

306
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:53,405
<i>Yet the public looks up to</i>
<i>You and me</i>

307
00:32:53,487 --> 00:32:55,125
Call the doctors.

308
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:58,756
<i>Not even in my dreams did I think</i>

309
00:32:59,247 --> 00:33:01,397
- Help me save him.
- Don't worry.

310
00:33:01,487 --> 00:33:03,239
Push it into the emergency room.

311
00:33:03,327 --> 00:33:06,046
How can I make you disappointed?

312
00:33:06,127 --> 00:33:07,879
Come and help.

313
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:10,720
Look at this moment

314
00:33:10,807 --> 00:33:12,798
PEOPLE'S HOSPITAL

315
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:17,684
<i>Happiness is almost in reach</i>

316
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:20,156
<i>I've waited a long time for this role</i>

317
00:33:20,247 --> 00:33:24,445
<i>To be your woman</i>

318
00:33:25,287 --> 00:33:27,801
<i>I have no right to make you</i>

319
00:33:27,887 --> 00:33:32,802
<i>Bear too many emotional burdens</i>

320
00:33:32,887 --> 00:33:38,439
<i>But I'm only human</i>

321
00:33:38,527 --> 00:33:41,166
- What's the verdict, doctor?
- I'm sorry. It was too late.

322
00:33:41,247 --> 00:33:42,441
Between the earth and the sky

323
00:33:42,527 --> 00:33:43,403
I couldn't save him.

324
00:33:43,487 --> 00:33:47,241
<i>My pain for all to see</i>

325
00:33:47,607 --> 00:33:54,797
<i>Yet the public looks up to you and I</i>

326
00:33:54,887 --> 00:34:01,963
<i>Not even in my dreams did I think</i>
<i>I could be this strong</i>

327
00:34:02,047 --> 00:34:09,283
<i>But how can I disappoint you and me</i>

328
00:34:24,807 --> 00:34:27,799
- Contact his parents.
- I understand, lnspector Lau.

329
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:32,486
Ching Ching, don't go.

330
00:34:32,567 --> 00:34:35,604
Our master won't like
a useless student like me.

331
00:34:35,687 --> 00:34:37,484
I'll miss you.

332
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:39,558
Take care of yourself.

333
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,721
Don't cry.

334
00:34:44,567 --> 00:34:47,479
- Ching Ching.
- I forbid you to go after her.

335
00:34:49,527 --> 00:34:51,518
Kneel down.

336
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:54,603
Dong Dong, stay here.

337
00:34:54,687 --> 00:34:59,158
You have to finish the task which
I had set aside for you two by yourself.

338
00:34:59,247 --> 00:35:03,320
The responsibility to uphold justice
will be left to you alone.

339
00:35:19,407 --> 00:35:21,523
Dong Dong, why are you crying?

340
00:35:21,607 --> 00:35:23,598
I haven't been crying.

341
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,238
What's wrong?

342
00:35:26,327 --> 00:35:30,639
I said it was nothing. What happened
with the case at the hospital today?

343
00:35:33,727 --> 00:35:36,799
The baby that went missing
fell to his death.

344
00:35:47,927 --> 00:35:50,760
I haven't seen you in more than
ten years. You still have good moves.

345
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:52,997
Where did the old monster
find an invisibility suit?

346
00:35:53,087 --> 00:35:55,521
He's behind the kidnapping
of the babies.

347
00:35:55,607 --> 00:35:59,043
- So are you still going to interfere?
- No, thanks.

348
00:35:59,127 --> 00:36:01,516
When I escaped from
the hole in the ground,

349
00:36:01,607 --> 00:36:03,802
even though you caught me,
you spared me.

350
00:36:03,887 --> 00:36:05,878
Nowadays I take good care of myself.

351
00:36:05,967 --> 00:36:08,197
Why does the old monster
want all these babies?

352
00:36:08,287 --> 00:36:11,120
He's going to pick one to be emperor
at the next solar eclipse.

353
00:36:11,207 --> 00:36:14,438
Then those who can't become the emperor
will become assassins, like you and I?

354
00:36:14,527 --> 00:36:16,882
Not only that, he's going to
turn them into Ninth Chan's.

355
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:21,358
Third Chan, why don't you do the babies
a favour and kill them all?

356
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:23,438
The old monster put poison in me.

357
00:36:23,527 --> 00:36:26,917
After I escaped, it took me 10 years
before I felt human again.

358
00:36:27,007 --> 00:36:28,998
I don't want the babies to be monsters.

359
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:31,521
Pretend you don't know
anything about it. Don't interfere.

360
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:34,440
If my Lord commands me,
I would kill you too.

361
00:36:35,047 --> 00:36:37,163
If you want to kill me, kill me now.

362
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:42,322
Next time you won't be able to catch it.

363
00:36:44,007 --> 00:36:47,841
Now you've told me everything, can
I really pretend I don't know anything?

364
00:37:04,327 --> 00:37:08,878
You are no longer Ching Ching. From this
day forth, your name will be Third Chan.

365
00:37:20,807 --> 00:37:24,436
YOU MUST GET HOLD OF THE
INVISIBILITY SUIT IN 10 DAYS TIME.

366
00:37:24,527 --> 00:37:29,999
AFTERWARDS, KILL THE PROFESSOR.
IF YOU FAIL, YOU FACE DEATH.

367
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,998
Hey, what are you doing?

368
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:51,722
I told you many times already. It's very
dangerous to come in here. Leave.

369
00:37:51,807 --> 00:37:54,162
What's so dangerous about it?
You're fine.

370
00:37:54,247 --> 00:37:57,478
You don't let me in here.
Are you concealing something?

371
00:38:00,527 --> 00:38:03,883
- What else am I concealing from you?
- You said the suit belongs to me too.

372
00:38:03,967 --> 00:38:06,561
How come I didn't know
it can withstand UV light?

373
00:38:06,647 --> 00:38:11,198
The suit can't withstand UV light.
If it could, you'd be the first to know.

374
00:38:11,287 --> 00:38:14,324
Then what were you researching
for the past few days?

375
00:38:16,367 --> 00:38:19,677
I'm researching this "Emergency room".

376
00:38:22,487 --> 00:38:25,877
They were all dead,
but I revived them all.

377
00:38:31,007 --> 00:38:34,795
- Will they have blossoms?
- Yes, in a month's time they'll bloom.

378
00:38:38,807 --> 00:38:40,877
Sam Jing.

379
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:46,119
Can you put them under the sun
each day and water them at night?

380
00:38:48,287 --> 00:38:51,484
Lucky star.
You taught me how to make them.

381
00:38:51,567 --> 00:38:54,081
You'll definitely see the flowers bloom.

382
00:38:58,607 --> 00:39:02,282
In ten days, you must get your hands
on the invisibility suit.

383
00:39:02,367 --> 00:39:07,725
Afterards, kill the professor.
If you fail, you face death.

384
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:11,238
Hey, your underlings are very cocky.

385
00:39:11,327 --> 00:39:14,603
You kept me locked up for two hours.
It was an accident.

386
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:16,962
If it wasn't for you,
the baby wouldn't have died.

387
00:39:17,047 --> 00:39:20,722
What? You think I threw him down?
The Super Heroine couldn't save him.

388
00:39:20,807 --> 00:39:24,277
You can leave now. You can deceive
everyone, but not yourself.

389
00:39:24,367 --> 00:39:29,202
Hey, that was enough.
You're just using me as a scapegoat.

390
00:39:29,287 --> 00:39:32,324
Fine, I'll do it for free.
I'll keep an eye on things for you then.

391
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:36,518
Miss, the most important thing
is to keep an eye on my child.

392
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:39,440
Don't worry. If I take your money,
I'll look for your child too.

393
00:39:39,527 --> 00:39:42,166
- Thank you.
- This time I really did myself in.

394
00:40:08,807 --> 00:40:10,718
That's dealt with.

395
00:40:15,687 --> 00:40:18,440
Wow. What's going on?
Why are there so many birdcages?

396
00:40:39,127 --> 00:40:41,482
Darn. The old monster has been alerted.

397
00:41:08,287 --> 00:41:09,879
Hello.

398
00:41:11,207 --> 00:41:13,323
Hello.

399
00:41:24,487 --> 00:41:26,523
How did he manage
to track me like this?

400
00:41:44,487 --> 00:41:46,523
Let's see how long you can last.

401
00:41:48,247 --> 00:41:54,163
Do you know
who the female intruder was?

402
00:41:54,247 --> 00:41:57,683
- No.
- I thought of someone.

403
00:41:57,767 --> 00:42:01,316
But she is supposed to have died
ten years ago.

404
00:42:01,407 --> 00:42:04,205
Yes, I killed Seventh Chan myself.

405
00:42:05,047 --> 00:42:08,756
The only person who can manage
to get in here is Super Heroine.

406
00:42:08,847 --> 00:42:11,486
She's been involving herself
with the case of the missing babies.

407
00:42:11,567 --> 00:42:14,843
The most likely intruder would be her.
My Lord, let me kill her.

408
00:42:14,927 --> 00:42:17,805
Let someone else do things like that.

409
00:42:17,887 --> 00:42:22,915
Nine, kill the woman for me.

410
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:25,521
If necessary, die with her.

411
00:42:42,767 --> 00:42:46,396
You old monster.
I won't let the needle enter my brain.

412
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:13,802
We've verified that this case is
separate from what's been happening.

413
00:43:13,887 --> 00:43:17,084
We've already promised the mayor
that there will not be a reoccurrence.

414
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:20,045
- Here's your deposit.
- What deposit?

415
00:43:20,127 --> 00:43:23,119
- I quit the case of your missing son.
- Hey.

416
00:43:23,207 --> 00:43:26,722
- I'm in a meeting. Let's talk later.
- No. There's no room for discussion.

417
00:43:26,807 --> 00:43:29,275
Miss.
You must have found out something.

418
00:43:29,367 --> 00:43:31,437
For the sake of the babies' lives,
tell us what it is.

419
00:43:31,527 --> 00:43:33,802
What's the use of telling you?

420
00:43:33,887 --> 00:43:36,481
If you had what it took, then you
wouldn't have had to hire me.

421
00:43:36,567 --> 00:43:38,558
- In the name of justice, you should...
- Fuck you.

422
00:43:38,647 --> 00:43:40,797
Because of justice, I'm going to die.

423
00:44:06,207 --> 00:44:08,198
It was your fault the baby died.

424
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:14,201
- Tell me what you know.
- You think I'd answer your questions?

425
00:44:14,287 --> 00:44:15,686
You will.

426
00:44:15,767 --> 00:44:19,316
When the doll fell just now,
you caught it without hesitation.

427
00:44:46,567 --> 00:44:49,081
Yes, I got the baby killed.

428
00:44:49,927 --> 00:44:54,603
Now I'm going to die soon.
Can't we just call it even?

429
00:44:56,767 --> 00:45:01,443
Why won't you let me be? I only want
to find a place to die in private.

430
00:45:01,527 --> 00:45:04,280
I only want to know who the person is
who's stealing the babies.

431
00:45:05,487 --> 00:45:07,478
Don't hurt the lnvisible Person.

432
00:45:07,567 --> 00:45:10,001
She's only a puppet without the means
to control her actions.

433
00:45:10,087 --> 00:45:14,365
That old monster. I won't let
his poisoned needles get into my brain.

434
00:45:14,447 --> 00:45:16,438
Don't.

435
00:45:17,647 --> 00:45:20,081
Leave while my senses are still with me.

436
00:45:22,247 --> 00:45:24,966
- I won't leave you.
- You will die.

437
00:45:26,247 --> 00:45:28,477
It's worth dying for a good cause.

438
00:45:32,247 --> 00:45:35,637
I can only stop the needles' progress,
but I can't take them out.

439
00:45:37,607 --> 00:45:41,077
Fine. I'll use this time to help you
rescue the babies from the old monster.

440
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:43,965
If we want to succeed,
we must get Third Chan involved.

441
00:45:44,047 --> 00:45:46,038
- The Invisible Person?
- Yes.

442
00:45:46,127 --> 00:45:49,244
Before I find Third Chan,
we have to be careful.

443
00:45:49,327 --> 00:45:53,081
Last time I was at the Demon Palace
I alerted the old monster to danger.

444
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,796
He thought it was you, so he's now sent
Ninth Chan to deal with you.

445
00:46:13,807 --> 00:46:17,641
Inspector Lau, a lunatic is holding
more than 10 hostages at the station.

446
00:46:17,727 --> 00:46:21,606
He destroyed the computer system, and
a train is hurtling towards the station.

447
00:46:21,687 --> 00:46:24,963
- How much time before it crashes?
- About five minutes.

448
00:46:25,047 --> 00:46:26,036
Roger that.

449
00:46:44,727 --> 00:46:46,445
All units get ready.

450
00:46:53,287 --> 00:46:55,278
Mind the mines.

451
00:46:56,727 --> 00:46:58,638
Don't step on it.

452
00:47:02,087 --> 00:47:04,078
Don't move.

453
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:07,237
Everyone be careful. There are mines.

454
00:47:07,327 --> 00:47:10,160
- Watch where you're going.
- Let's go to work.

455
00:47:17,647 --> 00:47:20,605
Go in now. In a minute,
the train will crash into the station.

456
00:47:20,687 --> 00:47:23,918
Go in now.
Save the people inside first.

457
00:47:29,767 --> 00:47:31,758
Why haven't you gone inside yet?

458
00:48:26,527 --> 00:48:29,087
Be careful. We're about to crash.

459
00:48:31,727 --> 00:48:33,718
Allow me.

460
00:48:44,207 --> 00:48:45,845
Go to hell.

461
00:49:09,247 --> 00:49:12,796
- Make a run for it. Run.
- Tell me how to stop the train.

462
00:49:12,887 --> 00:49:16,596
The lunatic destroyed the computer,
we can't stop it. Make a run for it.

463
00:49:20,847 --> 00:49:23,361
RIVER LEIH
MOUNT CHIK

464
00:49:29,447 --> 00:49:31,802
Run. lt's going to crash here.

465
00:50:01,487 --> 00:50:03,603
Catch.

466
00:50:08,167 --> 00:50:09,998
- Let's go.
- OK.

467
00:50:47,727 --> 00:50:49,718
Hubby.

468
00:50:53,687 --> 00:50:56,360
What did the doctor say?

469
00:50:56,447 --> 00:51:00,076
The doctor said if you were lucky,
you'll be able to walk in six months.

470
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:02,758
What if I'm unlucky?

471
00:51:04,047 --> 00:51:09,519
If you're unlucky,
you might become a cripple.

472
00:51:12,687 --> 00:51:14,678
Don't be like this.

473
00:51:14,767 --> 00:51:19,522
As the husband of Super Heroine,
I will support your every decision.

474
00:51:20,687 --> 00:51:23,155
When did you find out?

475
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:25,602
At the station entrance,

476
00:51:25,687 --> 00:51:29,680
when you were looking at me,
not wanting to go inside.

477
00:51:35,527 --> 00:51:38,599
No more secretive smiles from now on.

478
00:51:40,487 --> 00:51:42,478
And no more secret tears either.

479
00:51:43,407 --> 00:51:45,398
Just tell me everything.

480
00:51:53,647 --> 00:51:55,638
OK?

481
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:02,118
Hubby...

482
00:52:37,447 --> 00:52:39,324
Hey. I see a flower bud.

483
00:52:49,047 --> 00:52:51,641
What's wrong with you?
Sit down.

484
00:52:51,727 --> 00:52:54,446
No, I just thought of something.

485
00:52:54,527 --> 00:52:56,518
I have to write it down now.

486
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:59,118
Sit down first.

487
00:52:59,207 --> 00:53:01,198
Go now.

488
00:53:14,007 --> 00:53:16,123
How long have you known about it?

489
00:53:16,207 --> 00:53:18,198
I've known all along.

490
00:53:19,207 --> 00:53:21,562
During the research process
of the invisibility suit,

491
00:53:21,647 --> 00:53:24,161
I realised it emitted toxins.

492
00:53:25,047 --> 00:53:27,561
So that's why I wouldn't let you
come in here.

493
00:53:27,647 --> 00:53:31,560
But the orchids are budding now.

494
00:53:31,647 --> 00:53:35,879
If the flowers can be revived,
I'll be fine too.

495
00:53:35,967 --> 00:53:37,958
Get out of here now.

496
00:53:38,047 --> 00:53:41,437
We're partners.
I can't leave you here like this.

497
00:53:45,487 --> 00:53:48,365
- Where are my glasses?
- You're wearing them.

498
00:53:57,127 --> 00:54:01,279
I won't die before the invisibility suit
is completed.

499
00:54:03,127 --> 00:54:05,800
I can still smell the fragrance
of your hair.

500
00:54:35,287 --> 00:54:37,755
Take me outside
to look at the flower buds.

501
00:54:47,847 --> 00:54:51,203
I'll be fine. Get out.

502
00:54:57,007 --> 00:54:58,998
Let me in.

503
00:54:59,567 --> 00:55:01,558
Let me in.

504
00:55:02,247 --> 00:55:05,842
Even if you manage to get in,
I won't leave.

505
00:55:09,287 --> 00:55:13,121
The invisibility suit will be ready
when the orchids bloom.

506
00:55:13,207 --> 00:55:16,040
You promised me you'd take care of
them until they blossomed.

507
00:55:16,127 --> 00:55:18,118
Did you forget that already?

508
00:55:29,007 --> 00:55:33,080
Third Chan. Why are you still going
down there to see the old monster?

509
00:55:33,167 --> 00:55:35,442
You think he'll let the professor live?

510
00:55:35,527 --> 00:55:38,439
Once the invisibility suit is completed,
he'll still kill him.

511
00:55:38,527 --> 00:55:41,644
How many needles are in your system?

512
00:55:41,727 --> 00:55:46,357
If you help, then Super Heroine and I
have a chance to destroy him.

513
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:09,400
You're so afraid of death. Why are you
so willing to help Super Heroine?

514
00:56:09,487 --> 00:56:12,240
It doesn't matter that I owe you
my life, I'm not going to be grateful.

515
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:14,318
In order to protect the professor,

516
00:56:14,407 --> 00:56:18,923
you stayed under the control of the old
monster and harmed how many babies?

517
00:56:19,007 --> 00:56:21,760
You can deceive others,
but you can't deceive yourself.

518
00:56:21,847 --> 00:56:25,601
If Super Heroine helps you, then I'll be
waiting at the spot where you let me go.

519
00:56:25,687 --> 00:56:27,678
I won't leave until I see you there.

520
00:56:30,647 --> 00:56:32,638
Please do make the rendez-vous.

521
00:56:39,727 --> 00:56:42,241
I'm running out of time,
please hurry up.

522
00:56:46,727 --> 00:56:48,126
That's it.

523
00:56:49,687 --> 00:56:52,076
Sam Jing.

524
00:57:01,527 --> 00:57:03,518
Lucky stars.

525
00:57:03,607 --> 00:57:05,802
GET HOLD OF THE INVISIBILITY SUlT
WITHIN 10 DAYS.

526
00:57:12,007 --> 00:57:14,965
Why haven't you gotten hold
of the invisibility suit?

527
00:57:15,407 --> 00:57:19,036
Because if it can't work in sunlight,

528
00:57:19,127 --> 00:57:22,039
then the power of the emperor's army
will be greatly reduced.

529
00:57:22,127 --> 00:57:24,277
And the formula is almost completed.

530
00:57:24,367 --> 00:57:27,564
Give the professor a few more days.

531
00:57:27,647 --> 00:57:33,358
By sundown tomorrow, whether it works or
not, you have to take possession of it.

532
00:57:34,087 --> 00:57:36,362
Nine will help you then.

533
00:57:36,447 --> 00:57:42,238
In light of my Lord's master plan,
what I've done is so inconsequential.

534
00:57:42,327 --> 00:57:46,286
As long as I can find the true emperor
among these princes,

535
00:57:46,367 --> 00:57:49,484
then you'll become an honoured official.

536
00:57:59,447 --> 00:58:02,086
All the princes should be resting.

537
00:58:02,167 --> 00:58:04,476
You shouldn't be awake still.

538
00:58:12,367 --> 00:58:18,920
If they could all turn invisible, then
they'll be superior to Ninth Chan.

539
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:24,639
Then the world will belong
to the emperor and I.

540
00:58:26,007 --> 00:58:32,321
Third Chan, do you now understand
how important you are?

541
00:58:32,407 --> 00:58:34,284
I understand.

542
00:58:36,807 --> 00:58:38,798
September 18th.

543
00:58:40,727 --> 00:58:47,041
I discovered the formula to allow the
invisibility suit to withstand UV light.

544
00:58:52,207 --> 00:58:54,801
More the pity that it's time
for me to die.

545
00:58:54,887 --> 00:58:57,765
From the first day I started
my research on the invisibility suit,

546
00:58:57,847 --> 00:59:01,203
I knew I would die
from the toxins.

547
00:59:02,047 --> 00:59:07,075
If Sam Jing didn't exist
I wouldn't have the courage to face...

548
00:59:08,047 --> 00:59:12,723
If she knew my only wish
was to hold her hands

549
00:59:12,807 --> 00:59:20,600
and watch the orchids blossom together,
I wonder if she would still kill me.

550
00:59:21,487 --> 00:59:23,557
The day has come.

551
00:59:23,647 --> 00:59:28,721
Whether the invisibility suit
is a success or not,

552
00:59:28,807 --> 00:59:31,640
you have to bring it back here.

553
00:59:51,447 --> 00:59:54,564
Professor, I won't be coming back.

554
00:59:55,647 --> 00:59:57,638
I won't leave until I see you.

555
00:59:58,927 --> 01:00:04,240
Believe me, you're in great danger.
Leave the lab as soon as possible.

556
01:00:08,247 --> 01:00:11,683
What an idiot I am.
Even Super Heroine is late.

557
01:00:11,767 --> 01:00:14,725
Stupid. I shouldn't have said
I'd wait for their arrival regardless.

558
01:00:14,807 --> 01:00:17,367
I don't know whether
I should leave or stay.

559
01:00:28,367 --> 01:00:33,122
- Glad you consented to show your face.
- My Lord asked me to come to kill you.

560
01:00:33,207 --> 01:00:35,562
Hey, wait a moment, Third Chan.

561
01:00:35,647 --> 01:00:37,922
Make your move.
I won't show mercy this time.

562
01:00:38,007 --> 01:00:42,637
- You think you can bear to kill me?
- I must execute my Lord's orders.

563
01:00:42,727 --> 01:00:45,685
But I can give you a promise. After
you're dead, I promise one thing.

564
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:49,476
Hey, wait a moment.
You may be the person ending up dead.

565
01:00:49,567 --> 01:00:51,956
What have you left undone?
Tell me, and I'll do it for you.

566
01:00:53,287 --> 01:00:55,437
- Take care of the professor then.
- The professor?

567
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:14,635
- Save the professor for me.
- OK.

568
01:01:23,047 --> 01:01:25,515
Hey, Third Chan,
what are you trying to do?

569
01:01:25,607 --> 01:01:28,519
She didn't come here to kill you.
She came to commit suicide.

570
01:01:28,607 --> 01:01:32,680
- You'd rather sacrifice your own life?
- My own life?

571
01:01:32,767 --> 01:01:35,565
I'm just my Lord's murderous beast.

572
01:01:35,647 --> 01:01:40,084
A beast wouldn't have feelings. lt
wouldn't sacrifice itself for another.

573
01:01:48,567 --> 01:01:50,558
If you're willing to face yourself,

574
01:01:50,647 --> 01:01:53,002
your life will be more meaningful
than your death.

575
01:01:53,087 --> 01:01:56,204
But I can't face what I've done.
And I really can't face him.

576
01:01:56,287 --> 01:01:58,323
Third Chan.

577
01:02:02,967 --> 01:02:05,561
Hey. You two are leaving just like that?

578
01:02:05,647 --> 01:02:07,877
Damn. You shy away
at the slightest touch.

579
01:02:07,967 --> 01:02:09,958
I'd better ride my motorcycle instead.

580
01:02:12,047 --> 01:02:13,719
Wait for me.

581
01:02:18,447 --> 01:02:21,644
Third Chan.
You can change from this moment on.

582
01:02:21,727 --> 01:02:23,718
So what if I can?
I'll still be Third Chan.

583
01:02:23,807 --> 01:02:28,722
- You can become like Seventh Chan.
- It's too late. Don't follow me.

584
01:02:33,567 --> 01:02:37,355
This sucks. How come a motorbike
can't catch up to the horses?

585
01:02:42,127 --> 01:02:44,118
The fact that you're running away
from your past

586
01:02:44,207 --> 01:02:46,198
shows your true nature
is coming through.

587
01:02:46,287 --> 01:02:48,278
Then I really deserve to die.

588
01:02:51,127 --> 01:02:53,083
Don't.

589
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:06,603
What? Shit.

590
01:03:09,087 --> 01:03:12,602
Wow. You two have created
a whole bunch of trouble.

591
01:03:14,127 --> 01:03:16,357
Your luck has to hold. Hold on.

592
01:03:30,287 --> 01:03:32,278
Dong Dong?

593
01:03:32,367 --> 01:03:37,839
- Ching Ching?
- Let go. If not, you'll fall too.

594
01:03:37,927 --> 01:03:40,839
I'm not going to let go.

595
01:03:40,927 --> 01:03:42,804
Catch.

596
01:03:45,687 --> 01:03:47,723
Wow. This is tough on a girl.

597
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:54,125
I won't let go. If you're going to
let go, then let's do it together.

598
01:03:55,247 --> 01:03:58,205
- Is it really you?
- You two know each other?

599
01:04:02,007 --> 01:04:04,840
- I forgot it all.
- The past isn't important.

600
01:04:04,927 --> 01:04:07,760
What's important
is what your heart wants right now.

601
01:04:07,847 --> 01:04:10,805
Tell us what your heart
is telling you to do.

602
01:04:12,247 --> 01:04:15,159
My Lord has sent Ninth Chan to kill
the professor. I have to save him.

603
01:04:15,247 --> 01:04:17,238
What? The professor?

604
01:04:47,127 --> 01:04:49,118
Give it to me.

605
01:05:17,167 --> 01:05:19,476
The invisibility suit
can now withstand sunlight.

606
01:05:19,567 --> 01:05:21,558
No one can find it now.

607
01:05:23,087 --> 01:05:25,078
No.

608
01:05:29,407 --> 01:05:31,363
Sam Jing.

609
01:05:31,447 --> 01:05:34,120
There are a lot of things
I want to talk to you about.

610
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:36,198
They are all inside your gift.

611
01:05:49,767 --> 01:05:52,918
It's useless to attack him. He won't
let go if he can't get what he wants.

612
01:05:53,487 --> 01:05:55,000
Stop.

613
01:06:00,047 --> 01:06:03,323
- You can't give it to him.
- I've got nothing now.

614
01:06:03,407 --> 01:06:05,762
I can't let him die.

615
01:06:22,567 --> 01:06:24,398
I'm sorry.

616
01:06:24,487 --> 01:06:27,559
I knew your Lord
wouldn't be able to make you kill me.

617
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:46,756
You think it's going to be
that easy to take it?

618
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:55,003
Wait a second. Wait a sec.

619
01:07:21,327 --> 01:07:23,238
Loony bin. The tape's here.

620
01:07:23,927 --> 01:07:26,282
Come and get it.
Come and get it now.

621
01:07:34,327 --> 01:07:36,477
Goodbye.

622
01:07:36,567 --> 01:07:39,479
The stove is overheating.
We can't stay here.

623
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:06,845
Sam Jing,
it's better to destroy the equipment

624
01:08:06,927 --> 01:08:10,203
than to let him get his hands on it.

625
01:08:10,287 --> 01:08:12,278
Hey, let's split.

626
01:08:17,287 --> 01:08:19,323
- Go, you two.
- Then what are you...

627
01:08:19,407 --> 01:08:23,480
- Let her be.
- Where are you going?

628
01:08:23,567 --> 01:08:26,400
- We're going to the demon palace.
- Just the two of us?

629
01:08:26,487 --> 01:08:28,478
Let me get my gear first.

630
01:08:32,247 --> 01:08:35,876
Can you let me look
at the blooming orchids?

631
01:09:18,847 --> 01:09:20,838
All the babies are kept here.

632
01:09:20,927 --> 01:09:25,239
Don't touch anything, if we try to kill
the enemy here, the babies will die.

633
01:09:33,247 --> 01:09:36,876
- We have to end this.
- What are you doing?

634
01:09:36,967 --> 01:09:40,926
It'd be a tragedy to let them continue
like this. They are no longer human.

635
01:09:41,007 --> 01:09:44,443
They'll turn into something like Ninth
Chan. If I were them, I'd rather die.

636
01:09:44,527 --> 01:09:46,643
This is no time for mercy.

637
01:10:27,087 --> 01:10:29,078
Let's go.

638
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:57,158
Old monster.
Get ready for your execution.

639
01:10:57,247 --> 01:11:00,842
There's a lot of marsh gas here.
Be careful you don't get poisoned.

640
01:11:04,287 --> 01:11:08,599
You breathe in marsh gas as if it were
oxygen. See if I don't kill you.

641
01:11:12,967 --> 01:11:15,606
You two dare to enter
my Forbidden Palace.

642
01:11:15,687 --> 01:11:17,757
Let's get him.

643
01:11:19,887 --> 01:11:22,162
Extra-sensory powers?

644
01:11:37,847 --> 01:11:41,396
You're kneeling down to him now?
Where did your courage go?

645
01:11:42,207 --> 01:11:44,675
I'm not kneeling in worship.
My legs gave way, that's all.

646
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:47,486
You think the likes of you two
will be able to get the better of me?

647
01:11:47,567 --> 01:11:50,001
It's useless to kneel in worship.
The Four Guardians.

648
01:11:50,087 --> 01:11:52,555
- Yes.
- We're going to die anyway.

649
01:11:52,647 --> 01:11:54,877
You deal with the Lord,
I'll deal with the Four.

650
01:12:25,567 --> 01:12:27,285
What?

651
01:12:33,567 --> 01:12:36,525
It's an honour for you two
to die at my hands.

652
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:39,997
Damn. I think I've inhaled too much
marsh gas, I'm high. What shall we do?

653
01:12:40,087 --> 01:12:43,636
- We won't be his match.
- Don't let him distract you. Attack.

654
01:12:43,727 --> 01:12:46,036
I'll take your lives this time.

655
01:12:54,407 --> 01:12:56,398
Darn.

656
01:13:05,687 --> 01:13:08,520
- Dong Dong, take Seventh Chan away.
- No, I'm going to fight to the end.

657
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:10,165
No.

658
01:13:10,247 --> 01:13:12,522
If you don't leave now,
you'll be poisoned.

659
01:13:12,607 --> 01:13:14,438
- Let's go.
- OK.

660
01:13:21,167 --> 01:13:24,079
I can't handle it anymore.
Got to take in some oxygen now.

661
01:13:45,247 --> 01:13:47,238
Go to hell.

662
01:14:11,887 --> 01:14:14,447
Good. He should have been
blown to smithereens this time.

663
01:14:16,847 --> 01:14:20,123
- How come that explosion came so late?
- He's not dead yet.

664
01:14:38,527 --> 01:14:40,518
I'll blow you up.

665
01:14:45,287 --> 01:14:47,278
He's afraid of the light.

666
01:14:47,367 --> 01:14:49,597
- Throw up more sticks of dynamite.
- OK.

667
01:15:42,607 --> 01:15:45,246
Damn. Is my face OK? Well?

668
01:15:47,047 --> 01:15:48,446
What?

669
01:15:48,527 --> 01:15:51,644
I don't know if you're going to die
or not, but you scared me to death.

670
01:16:06,647 --> 01:16:08,842
What?
He's not dead yet.

671
01:16:34,127 --> 01:16:35,924
He can still move.

672
01:16:36,007 --> 01:16:39,602
Although his body has been destroyed,
he's using his mind to control himself.

673
01:17:02,327 --> 01:17:04,318
He has control of me.

674
01:17:05,247 --> 01:17:08,364
- I'll help you.
- Don't come over.

675
01:17:12,727 --> 01:17:14,524
I can't control myself.

676
01:17:19,247 --> 01:17:21,238
Go now. Go.

677
01:17:22,127 --> 01:17:24,687
Take Seventh Chan
away from here now.

678
01:17:51,527 --> 01:17:53,563
- What shall we do?
- Let's go.

679
01:18:09,487 --> 01:18:10,966
Ching Ching.

680
01:18:11,047 --> 01:18:15,325
- Don't let me continue fighting.
- Son of a bitch.

681
01:18:16,407 --> 01:18:18,523
Die. Die. Die.

682
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:21,877
Go.

683
01:18:22,807 --> 01:18:24,798
Fuck you, bony bitch.

684
01:18:43,087 --> 01:18:45,362
He's taking over my body.
Leave this place now.

685
01:18:45,447 --> 01:18:49,440
- If you die, we'll die together.
- I'm content I saw you again.

686
01:18:50,487 --> 01:18:52,478
I'm sorry.

687
01:18:53,087 --> 01:18:54,884
Third Chan.

688
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:01,527
- Ching Ching.
- You old monster.

689
01:19:01,607 --> 01:19:03,802
I'd rather die than let you win.

690
01:19:03,887 --> 01:19:06,162
China must have an emperor...

691
01:19:06,247 --> 01:19:09,364
China must have an emperor...
China must have an emperor...

692
01:19:15,687 --> 01:19:17,325
China must have an emperor...

693
01:19:17,407 --> 01:19:19,204
The past doesn't matter.

694
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:23,678
- China must have an emperor...
- What matters is the here and now.

695
01:19:23,767 --> 01:19:26,235
China must have an emperor...
China must have an emperor...

696
01:19:29,607 --> 01:19:33,395
Why don't we look at
the blooming orchids together?

697
01:19:35,007 --> 01:19:38,363
Professor.

698
01:20:04,327 --> 01:20:06,318
Ching Ching.

699
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:10,438
You won't die.

700
01:20:11,687 --> 01:20:13,200
Hey.

701
01:20:13,287 --> 01:20:17,360
Honestly, get to the ground first
then talk. I'm dying here.

702
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:29,246
Are you all right?
Where's Seventh Chan?

703
01:20:29,327 --> 01:20:31,921
Hey. Got something good here.
Something good here.

704
01:20:32,007 --> 01:20:33,406
Wear this.

705
01:20:33,487 --> 01:20:37,958
We can't look like a fright. What if
reporters come to take our pictures?

706
01:20:38,047 --> 01:20:40,242
Put them on.

707
01:21:10,127 --> 01:21:13,961
The police have solved the alarming case
of the disappearing babies.

708
01:21:14,047 --> 01:21:17,005
Most of the missing babies
have been found.

709
01:21:17,087 --> 01:21:19,237
Reporting live from the scene.

710
01:21:19,327 --> 01:21:22,717
I heard rumours that it was three
unknown women who solved this case.

711
01:21:22,807 --> 01:21:25,037
What's their connection to the police?

712
01:21:25,127 --> 01:21:28,199
Nothing special.
They are friends of the police.

713
01:21:28,287 --> 01:21:30,482
- Then who are they?
- No comment.

714
01:21:30,567 --> 01:21:32,683
Then do you know
when they'll show up again?

715
01:21:32,767 --> 01:21:34,962
They'll show up when necessary.

716
01:21:35,047 --> 01:21:37,481
Then do you know what they're called?

717
01:21:37,567 --> 01:21:39,683
Yeah, what are they called?

718
01:21:39,767 --> 01:21:42,076
- What's their names?
- They are called "The Heroic Trio".

719
01:21:42,167 --> 01:21:43,646
- I see.
- The Heroic Trio.

720
01:21:43,727 --> 01:21:45,877
- When did we get that name?
- How do you know their name?

721
01:21:46,087 --> 01:21:48,726
- What's the origin of that name?
- It's classified. Sorry.

722
01:21:48,807 --> 01:21:50,798
It was an improvisation.

723
01:21:50,887 --> 01:21:57,520
<i>One, then another and another</i>
<i>We meet and we go through hard times</i>

724
01:21:57,607 --> 01:22:04,206
<i>With feeling and passion, with emotion</i>
<i>We pass stop after stop in our lives</i>

725
01:22:04,287 --> 01:22:07,723
<i>One turn,</i>
<i>One bend of the road it's just me</i>

726
01:22:07,807 --> 01:22:11,641
<i>A look backwards,</i>
<i>A life a moment in time</i>

727
01:22:11,727 --> 01:22:15,163
<i>Each move, each action is only</i>

728
01:22:15,247 --> 01:22:19,286
<i>Something trivial, something difficult</i>
<i>It gets turned into a legend</i>

729
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:26,205
<i>With you, with me, with anyone</i>
<i>With sadness also comes romance</i>

737
01:22:51,847 --> 01:22:55,203

<i>I go my way</i>

738
01:22:55,287 --> 01:22:56,845

01:23:03,007 --> 01:23:06,283

742
01:23:06,367 --> 01:23:09,677

01:23:09,767 --> 01:23:13,680
