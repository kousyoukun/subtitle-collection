[SIMON] The creation of synthetic DNA

was the relatively simple half

to alight in its midst.

242
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,367
Then during the incubation period,

243
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,561
the nano begins to introduce
its own language,

We need to leave.

What happened to Amy?

1316
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:25,325
[JIM] She did very well.

1317
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,962
Agreed, the situation is untidy,

1318
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:31,646
but given the unpredictable
nature of the assignment,

1319
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,446
she prosecuted her mandate perfectly.

1320
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,009
She was measured and surgical,

1321
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:40,766
even when the situation
was considerably less so.

1322
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:42,205
Most importantly,

1323
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:46,362
she followed her directives
without hesitation.

1324
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:51,043
The collateral damage
was regrettable, of course.

1325
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,405
But in this case,

1326

unavoidable.

1327

I think these events
make it punishingly clear

1328
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:04,842

01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:06,841
The L-9

1330
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:09,369
was the inferior program.

Though its emotional development

1332
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:18,446
was certainly remarkable,

1333
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,520
the immediate termination

1334

but clear necessity.

Well, I guess the old dogs
hunt the best, sir.

Then it's settled.
