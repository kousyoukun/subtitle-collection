Hi.

I finished your book.

I finished your book.

You don't have to sign.

I know you can read my lips,

13
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,786
but I am getting better.

14
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,704
Better.

00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:06,539
-I um... I want to practise.
-Cool.

16
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,085
Taking another class with John.

17
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:11,336
-John?
-It's fun!

18
00:04:12,046 --> 00:04:15,758
I am way better at understanding it
than actually doing it, but...

19
00:04:16,884 --> 00:04:18,636
So, what did you think?

20
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:20,804
What did I... What did I think?

21
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:24,099
-I loved it.
-Thank you.

22
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:25,017
I um...

23
00:04:25,976 --> 00:04:28,311
I loved Riley.

24
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:29,813
I loved Erin.

25
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:32,315
-Thank you.
-They were great characters.

26
00:04:33,108 --> 00:04:36,402
I tried to guess the ending.

27
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:41,075
I am usually on point with that
sort of thing, but I was way off!

28
00:04:41,825 --> 00:04:43,618
How did you do that?
How do you...?

29
00:04:43,702 --> 00:04:45,370
How do you come up with that?

Makes me crazy.

32
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:55,673
Any possible outcome
is like a movie in my head...

33
00:04:55,756 --> 00:04:57,465
with many endings.

34
00:04:57,548 --> 00:05:00,343

I have a voice in my mind.

38
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:13,816
Does the voice sound like a kid?

00:53:13,191 --> 00:53:16,152
I got here and found the place like this.
There was someone inside.

00:53:16,236 --> 00:53:18,321
He came running past me
and knocked me cold.

00:53:18,405 --> 00:53:21,449
I woke up without my phone,
my gun or my radio.

300
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:22,743
I need to call for backup.

301
00:53:22,827 --> 00:53:25,161
-Do you know who lives here?
-Yeah, it's Maddie.

302
00:53:25,245 --> 00:53:26,831
Maddie Young. She's a friend of ours.

303
00:53:26,914 --> 00:53:27,915
Does she live alone?

304
00:53:27,999 --> 00:53:30,751
Yeah. My girlfriend comes here
all the time. I thought maybe...

305
00:53:30,835 --> 00:53:31,836
What is her name?

306
00:53:32,712 --> 00:53:34,212
It's Sarah. Sarah Greene.

307
00:53:34,797 --> 00:53:37,800
OK. Sarah. I'm sorry.
Can I use your phone to call for backup?

308
00:53:37,883 --> 00:53:39,509
I should have called it in already,

309
00:53:39,594 --> 00:53:41,971
but I just started this job,
and when I got here...

310
00:53:42,054 --> 00:53:44,890
-Are you police?
-Deputy. Just barely, though.

311
00:53:46,224 --> 00:53:48,603
I can call the Sheriff,
if I can just use your...?

312
00:53:51,814 --> 00:53:52,815
Here you go.

313
00:53:54,107 --> 00:53:55,067
Thanks.

314
00:54:01,573 --> 00:54:03,951
Yeah, I got a 7-19 here at 811 Fairhope.

315
00:54:04,576 --> 00:54:07,412
Signs of possible forced entry.
Suspect is at large on foot.

316
00:54:11,042 --> 00:54:13,501
No one else here,
but a neighbour just showed up.

317
00:54:14,795 --> 00:54:16,129
Yeah. OK.

318
00:54:17,422 --> 00:54:18,423
See you soon.

319
00:54:20,216 --> 00:54:21,343
Hey, did you see that?

320
00:54:26,389 --> 00:54:27,725
Yeah, I did.

321
00:54:30,102 --> 00:54:32,145
This girl, Maddie,
does she have a boyfriend?

322
00:54:33,396 --> 00:54:34,481
No, I don't think so.

323
00:54:35,231 --> 00:54:36,191
Hm.

324
00:54:36,274 --> 00:54:40,071
Family nearby? Anybody else that could
possibly have access to the house?

325
00:54:40,696 --> 00:54:43,281
No, she pretty much keeps to herself.

326
00:54:44,324 --> 00:54:46,077
-Is your arm OK?
-Oh, yeah.

327
00:54:46,661 --> 00:54:49,747
The guy just ploughed into me.
He hit me like a truck.

328
00:54:50,497 --> 00:54:54,710
He must have been...
well, just about your size, actually.

329
00:54:54,794 --> 00:54:55,878
You know, like a jock.

330
00:54:55,961 --> 00:54:57,088
Linebacker type.

331
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:58,881
Scary guy.

332
00:55:01,008 --> 00:55:02,051
Can I get that back?

333
00:55:03,678 --> 00:55:04,679
The phone.

334
00:55:05,595 --> 00:55:06,429
Oh!

335
00:55:06,513 --> 00:55:07,555
[chuckles]

336
00:55:07,639 --> 00:55:09,725
Yeah, of course. Sorry.

337
00:55:09,809 --> 00:55:13,020
So stupid of me. Force of habit.

338
00:55:21,112 --> 00:55:24,572
You said you responded to a call.
Was that from Maddie?

339
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:27,743
From the dispatcher... actually.

340
00:55:28,618 --> 00:55:32,164
They said someone had called it in.
I just assumed it was the resident.

341
00:55:32,873 --> 00:55:36,919
Yeah, because she wouldn't be able
to make that call. She's deaf and mute.

No, not always.

she must be able to get by.
