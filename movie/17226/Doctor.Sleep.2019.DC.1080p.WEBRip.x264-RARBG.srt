你想知道我為什麼戴著

這是一頂魔法帽子
It's a magic hat.

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,250
我袖子裏什麼都沒有
Nothing up my sleeves.

24
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,160
我的帽子裏什麼都沒有
Nothing in my hat.

別擔心  那是我的朋友

00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,450
說到特別
And speaking of special,

32
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,750
你也有點魔法 不是嗎？
you're a little magic, too, aren't you?

33
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,320
我手裏的花 是什麼顏色的？
The flower in my hand, what color is it?

34
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,360
哦 沒事的 親愛的

37
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,800
紫羅蘭...
Violet...

38
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,900
就像你一樣
like you.

39

親愛的 最好吃的是特別的

我應該回去找我媽媽了
I should get back to my mom.

44
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,920
不 留下來 呆一會兒 多看點魔術
No, stay. Stay awhile. See more magic.

45
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,300
噢
Ow.

46
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,370
你是個特別的小東西
You are a special little thing,

47
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
不是嗎？
aren't you?

48
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,280
紫羅蘭？
Violet?

49
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,210
紫羅蘭！
Violet!

50
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,320
紫羅蘭！
Violet!

51
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,420
紫...
Vi...

52
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,760
不要
Please.

53
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:55,140
嘿 沒關係的 道客
Hey. It's okay, Doc.

54
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,750
沒關係的
It's okay.

55
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,090
那兒
There.

56
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,550
全都干了
All dry.

57
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,260
出什麼事了？
What happened?

58
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,500
你得跟我說 丹尼
You have to talk to me, Danny.

59
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,200
我們離開後你就沒說過話...
You haven't talked since we left...

60
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,370
拜託 道客
Please, Doc.

61
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,110
拜託
Please.

62
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,640
那麼...
So...

63
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,460
你不說話 是吧 道客？
you ain't talking, huh, Doc?

64
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,700
我第一次見到你也沒怎麼說話
Weren't talking much first time I met you neither.

65
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,820
小男孩...
Little boy...

66
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,320
打算在那個破舊的地方度過一個漫長的冬天
set to spend a long winter at that rotten old place.

67
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,660
只有他和他的媽媽和爸爸
Just him and his mommy and daddy.

68
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,520
爸爸和那個男孩一樣黑
Daddy as dark as that boy is bright.

69
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,630
孩子 他很聰明
And, boy, is he bright.

70
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,360
他光芒四射...
He's shining like fire...

71
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,730
在那個地方...
in the one place...

72
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,460
對一個發光的人來說是最糟糕的地方
the worst place for someone who shines.

73
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,680
你還記得我們第一次真正交談嗎？
You remember the first time we really talked?

74
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,380
當我在你腦子裏說話的時候？
When I spoke up inside your head?

75
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,650
讓你感覺很好 對吧？
Made you feel good, right?

76
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,520
我知道你並不孤單
Knowing you weren't alone.

77
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,910
爸爸想殺了我
Daddy tried to kill me.

78
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,790
不全是他  你得知道
It wasn't all him, you gotta know.

79
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:18,590
那個地方給他帶來了黑暗  就像給你帶來光一樣
That place fed his dark, like it fed on your light.

80
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,850
他身上也有光
And he had some light in him, too.

81
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,630
就像你有黑暗一樣
Just like you got some dark.

82
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,670
我們兩個都有
We all got both.

83
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,330
我還沒完呢
It's not done with me.

84
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,440
你有沒有想過我是怎麼出現的？
It ever strike you funny how I showed up when I did?

85
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,450
當你需要我的時候
When you needed me.

86
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,770
有人也為我這麼做了
Someone did that for me, too.

87
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,690
我奶奶教我的
My grandma taught me,

88
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,720
我教過你
and I taught you.

89
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,930
總有一天 丹尼·托倫斯 你會教別人的
And some day, Danny Torrance, you'll teach someone else.

90
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,350
我不會的
I won't.

91
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,590
哦 你不會的 嗯？
Oh, you won't, huh?

92
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,330
我不會發光的 我是說
I won't shine, I mean.

93
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,790
不會了 很危險
No more. It's dangerous.

94
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,760
有時候也是這樣
Reckon it is sometimes.

95
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,270
她找到我了
She found me.

96
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,570
她會回來的  直到她得到我
She'll come back and come back until she gets me.

97
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,610
你說得對
You're right.

98
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,850
俯瞰者被判有罪  封住他
The Overlook's condemned. Boarded up.

99
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,610
他們是飢餓的老鬼
They're starvin' old ghosts,

100
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,720
他們在找你
and they're reachin' out for you.

101
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,850
她也不會罷休的
Won't stop with her, either.

102
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,020
書裏的照片
Pictures in a book.

103
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,770
你說它們只是一本書裏的照片  它們傷害不了我
You said they were just pictures in a book and they couldn't hurt me.

104
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,760
一些事情
Some things,

105
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,770
黑暗的東西  閃閃發光就像食物
dark things, the shining's like food.

106
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,490
它們是蚊子在吸血
They're mosquitoes landing for blood.

107
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,940
《俯瞰》
The Overlook,

108
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,840
對我來說只是照片
it was always just pictures to me.

109
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,440
但我不像你那樣光彩照人
But I didn't shine like you.

110
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,380
沒人像你一樣
Nobody shines like you.

111
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:52,950
所以 你在那該死的酒店裏 就像一個百萬瓦的電池
So, you in that damn hotel, you was like a million-watt battery

112
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,720
全部插上電源
all plugged in.

113
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,860
它把它吃光了
And it ate it up.

114
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,560
你做到了
You made it real.

115
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,430
你一進門就開始了
Started soon as you walked through the door.

116
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,770
對此我無能為力 很抱歉告訴你
Can't do nothing about that, I'm sorry to tell you,

117
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,000
但你不是孩子
but you're not a child.

118
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,040
你現在老了
You're older now.

119
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,340
在某種程度上 要老得多
Much older, in a way.

120
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,830
你得聽聽這個
You gotta hear this.

121
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,480
世界是個飢餓的地方
World's a hungry place.

122
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,480
最黑暗的東西是最飢餓的  他們會吃掉發光的東西
And the darkest things are the hungriest, and they'll eat what shines.

123
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,890
像蚊子或水蛭一樣成群結隊的
Swarm it like mosquitoes or leeches.

124
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,610
對此我無能為力
Can't do nothing about that.

125
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,830
你所能做的...
What you can do...

126
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,390
就是讓他們反對他們
is turn what they come for against 'em.

127
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,860
我祖父
My grandfather,

128
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,530
他是個刻薄的狗娘養的
he was a mean son of a bitch.

129
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,740
內心黑暗
Dark inside.

130
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,510
和你爸爸一樣的黑暗
Same type of dark as your dad.

131
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,010
把我打昏  我奶奶也被打
Beat me senseless, and my grandma, too,

132
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,720
當他死的時候  我高興的跳舞
and when he died, I danced.

133
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,480
但他總是回來
But he kept on coming back.

134
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,820
站在我的房間裏
Standing in my room.

135
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,530
煙熏得又黑又臭
Suit all gray and stinkin'

136
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,350
不管他在那個盒子里長了什麼黴菌
from whatever mold was growin' on him in that box.

137
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,090
有一天 他抓住了我 他是真實的
One day, he grabbed me, and he was real.

138
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,470
他的指甲很長
His nails were long

139
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,870
從墳墓裏生長出來
from growing in the grave,

140
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,670
他們割傷了我  道格
and they cut me, Doc.

141
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,470
割傷我
Cut me deep.

142
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,470
所以 奶奶
So, Grandma,

143
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,380
她教了我一個把戲
she taught me a trick.

144
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,380
給了我一份禮物
Gave me a present.

145
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,580
我想讓你知道這個盒子...

為了我的下一個把戲...哦 我的天 對不起
For my next trick... Oh, my goodness. Sorry.

297
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,540
有時候 如果我...
Sometimes, if I...

298
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,080
不好意思
Sorry.

299
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,510
有人看到我的勺子了嗎？
Has anyone seen my spoons?

300
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,350
我能做到
I can do that.

好吧 確保你們不要這麼做
Okay, make sure you guys don't do this.

304
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,910
哦！
Oh!

305
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,530
呃...我們可以忘了午睡時間
Uh... We can forget about naptime.

306
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,360
-再過幾個小時 -嗯

307
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,440
跟我說吧 「再過幾個小時 」
Say it with me. "Just a few more hours."

308
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,030
再過幾個小時
Just a few more hours.

309
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,770
怎麼回事？
What the hell?

310
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,020
戴夫...
Dave...

311
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,630
阿布拉卡達布拉拉
Abracadabra

312
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,720

嗨 你好啊 瞌睡蟲
Well, hi there, sleepyhead.

314
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,490
打擾了
Sorry.

315
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,850
我不得不讓你睡得很沉
I had to sleep you pretty hard.

316
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,860
你是個堅強的人
You're a tough one.

317
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,490
任性
Willful.

318
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,130
你知道  我查過了
You know, I checked.

319
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,660
三個月六個男人
Six men in three months

320
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,070
臉頰上有那些小蛇咬傷的紋身
with those little snakebite tattoos on their cheeks.

321
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,930
為什麼  你一直很忙
Why, you've been busy.

322
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:10,510
蛇咬安迪  那就是你
Snakebite Andi, that's who you are.

323
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,840
那麼  我是誰？
So, who am I?

324
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,050
你就是個綁架我的瘋女人
You're some crazy bitch who kidnapped me.

325
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,790
從現在起只是真相
Just the truth from now on.

326
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,920
你只會說實話
You will only speak the truth.

327
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,760
你是我見過的最漂亮的女人
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

328
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:31,800
上帝啊  效果有點太好了  不是嗎？
My God. Works a little too well, don't it?

329
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,800
這就是交易  蛇咬安迪
Here's the deal, Snakebite Andi.

330
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:38,540
你是個推手 嗯？你可以催眠人
You're a pusher, hmm? You can push people.

331
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,880
我們已經有一段時間  沒人在這兒幫忙了
We haven't had a pusher around here for a little while,

332
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:45,700
所以我要給你一個我近40年都沒給過的交易
so I'm gonna offer you a deal I haven't offered anyone in almost 40 years.

333
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,480
你多大了 達林？
How old are you, darlin'?

334
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,290
15歲
Fifteen.

335
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,090
15歲？
Fifteen?

336
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:57,290
哦 天哪 多大的年紀啊
Oh, God, what an age.

337
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,560
女人的春天 不是嗎？
Springtime of your womanhood, isn't it?

338
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:03,570
嗯 你不再是個女孩了
Mm. You're not a girl anymore,

339
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:07,270
但你也沒有一個凹痕
but you don't have a single dent yet either.

340
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,830
萬有引力根本沒注意到你
Gravity hasn't even noticed you.

341
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,000
不是15歲
Not at 15.

342
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,830
但是  男人...
Men, though...

343
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,770
不  不  不害羞
No, no, no. No shame.

344
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,820
你還回來了  是不是？
You paid that back, didn't you?

345
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,290
這就是我給你的 一直到春天
That's what I'm offering you. Springtime forever.

346
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,720
十年後 你還是15歲
Ten years from now, you're still 15.

347
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,020
一百 也許十七
A hundred, maybe 17.

348
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,130
吃得好
Eat well,

349
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:38,960
保持年輕 長壽
stay young, live long.

350
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,040
你和你的朋友...
So, you and your friend...

351
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:47,170
嗯 不是我朋友 那是我的家人
Mm, not my friend. That's my family.

352
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,640
我們是真正的結 親愛的
We're the True Knot, dear.

353
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,910
真正的結
The True Knot.

354
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,080
交織在一起的東西永遠不能解開
What's tied can never be untied.

355
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,980
你喜歡嗎？
You like it?

356
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,260
哦 對不起 我只是...
Oh. Sorry. I was just...

357
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:18,670
沒關係的 人們喜歡看它
That's okay. People love to look at it.

358
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,670
我們以前在圖書館裏設置過這個
We used to set this up in the library.

359
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,940
社區項目  只不過是自謀生路而已
Community project, just taking a life all its own.

360
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,940
看  我們從那裏的鐘樓開始
See, we started with the clock tower There.

361
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,680
-哦 是的   -隻是不斷成長
- Oh, yeah. - Just keeps growing.

362
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,110
孩子們叫它蒂尼敦
Kids call it Teenytown.

363
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,410
孩子們造這個？
The kids build this?

364
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,180
在一些幫助下  是的
With some help, oh, Yeah.

365
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,940
堅持下去  建設全鎮廣場..
Keep it up, build the whole town square.

366
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,060
你是下車還是騎著大拇指？
Are you off the bus or riding your thumb?

367
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,390
是的 公共汽車
Yeah, the bus.

368
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:46,030
哦 很少有人坐公共汽車到這麼遠的北方
Oh. Not many ride the bus this far north.

369
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,960
除非他們在找工作
Unless they're looking for work.

370
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,990
是的
Yeah.

371
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,970
換個地方
Change of scenery,

372
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:58,660
還是你逃避什麼？
or you running away from something?

373
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,980
哦 別介意我 希望我是...
Oh, don't mind me. I hope I'm...

374
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,180
新面孔就是全部
New face is all.

375
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,810
是的
Yeah.

376
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,370
我想我是在逃避我自己吧
Guess I'm running away from myself, I guess.

377
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:10,480
是的
Oh, Yeah.

378
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:15,960
我知道那種表情 太好了 我很抱歉地說
I know that look. Too well, I'm sorry to say.

379
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,830
離開你自己 那真是個難題
Running away from yourself. That is a pickle.

380
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,430
無論你走到哪裏 你都要帶著自己
You take yourself with you wherever you go.

381
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:26,400
-那不是婊子嗎？-嗯
- Ain't that the bitch? - Mm-hmm.

382
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,900
房租是每周85英鎊
Rent's 85 a week,

383
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,300
先付
payable up front.

384
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:32,840
比利替你付了頭兩筆錢  剩下的就靠你了
Billy paid your first two, rest's on you.

385
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:36,480
不許養寵物  不許聚會  不許有噪音
No pets, no parties, no noise.

386
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,150
我是一個安靜的中尉
I'm a quiet tenant.

387
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:43,280
最後一個人也這麼說  數學生
Last guy said the same. Math student.

388
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,190
即使讓他把牆漆成黑板
Even let him paint the wall all blackboard,

389
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:48,220
這樣他就可以在上面塗鴉他的小拼圖了
so he could scribble his little puzzles up There.

390
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:51,130
不安靜   不  先生
Wasn't quiet. No, sir.

391
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:54,400
他離開的時候連畫都沒畫 但我很高興他沒有畫
Didn't even paint over this when he left, but I'm glad he didn't,

392
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,000
因為我可以讓你輕鬆點
'cause I can make this easy for ya,

393
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,990
所以你每天早上醒來都會看到它
so you see it every morning when you wake.

394
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,270
你真的想為這隻小狗擔保嗎？
You sure you wanna vouch for this pup?

395
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,810
很確定
Pretty sure.

396
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,070
是你的錯  比利
It's your ass, Billy.

397
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,100
心臟在滴血  這次
Bleedin' heart, this one.

398
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,050
我在樓下 一樓 如果你需要什麼
I'm downstairs, ground floor, if you need anything.

399
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,810
明天找我 談談工作
Find me tomorrow, talk about some work.

400
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,360
你為什麼這麼做？
Why are you doing this?

401
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,920
你不瞭解我
You don't know me.

402
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,930
是的  我不知道
No, I don't.

403
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,830
但我知道你的表情 就像我說的
But I know the look, like I said.

404
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:32,270
有時候我會對人產生這種感覺
And sometimes I get this feeling about people.

405
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,200
-我想很難理解   -嗯
- Hard to understand, I guess. - Mm.

406
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,060
比你想像的容易
Easier than you think.

407
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,200
-謝謝 -好吧
- Thanks. - All right.

408
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,850
準備好了嗎？
You ready?

409
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,560
她準備好了
She's ready.

410
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,410
誰...這些人是誰？
Who... Who are these people?

411
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:16,040
你會發現的
You'll find out after.

412
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,950
那邊是格拉姆帕·弗利克...
That over there is Grampa Flick...

413
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,010
他會帶領我們 躺下
and he'll lead us. Lie down.

414
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,870
這裏
There.

415
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,020
不用害怕 你明白嗎？
No fear. You understand?

416
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,060
我們是真正的結
We are the True Knot

417
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,900
我們要忍耐
and we endure.

418
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,310
我們是被選中的人
We are the chosen ones.

419
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:52,450
我們是幸運的人
We are the fortunate ones.

420
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:59,580
交織在一起的東西不能解開
What is tied cannot be untied.

421
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,320
這是一個女人
Here is a woman.

422
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,920
她會加入我們嗎？
Would she join us?

423
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:13,390
她會把她的生活和我們的生活聯繫起來嗎？
Would she tie her life to our life?

424
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:15,100
是的
Yes.

425
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,540
是的
Yes.

426
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,630
是的

430
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:30,010
她剩下的不多了
There's not much of her left.

431
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,090
她嘗起來...
And she tastes...

432
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,120

他們還沒找到我們

他們習慣於聽到他的哭聲
They were used to hearing him cry

440
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,230
因為我讓他一個人呆著

441
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,710
所以他們什麼也沒做

God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,

有勇氣去改變我能做的事

「除非你知道某人的全部情況 否則你不能評判他 」
"You can't judge someone till you know their whole story."

492
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,630
你可能認為你明白

什麼？

有個戈徹或高徹的孩子  關於骨頭的事

00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:28,840
你在醫院的浴室裏洗手
You were washing your hands in the hospital bathroom

514
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:31,340
你把手錶忘在肥皂分配器上了
and you left it on the soap dispenser.

515
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:36,520
好吧 看看肥皂分配器

我希望我能說 呃...

519
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,420
很幸運的猜測
Lucky guess.

520
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:56,900
胡說
My ass.

521
00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:00,730
我想是直覺吧 就像我內心的一種感覺 可能是...
Intuition, I suppose. Like a feeling in my gut. Maybe a...

522
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:04,480
很幸運的猜測

523

524
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,980

525
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:11,880
我是說在弗雷澤 你為什麼在這裏？
I mean here in Frazier. Why are you here?

526
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,420
不要和我胡扯  丹
And don't bullshit me, Dan.

527
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:17,520
我喜歡自己的直覺
I'm prone to gut feelings of my own.

528
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,960
我不知道  我不知道
I don't know. I don't know.

529
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:24,390
一些和我所做的不同的事情
Something different than I've been doing.

530
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,760
更好的事情
Something better.

531
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:31,040
坦白說  一切都好
Anything's better, frankly.

532
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,670
你去教堂？
You go to church?

533
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,980
有關係嗎？
Does it matter?

534
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
你相信什麼嗎？一些事情...
Do you believe in something? Something...

535
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,440
比你重大？
bigger than you?

536
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:45,720
我們的...我們的信仰不能讓我們變得更好
Our... Our beliefs don't make us better people.

537
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:48,080
我們的行動讓我們變得更好
Our actions make us better people.

538
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,860
所以 比利說你具有條理的能力
So, Billy says you have orderly experience.

539
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,560
是的
That's right.

540
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:56,130
你現在在工作嗎？
You workin' right now?

541
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:59,630
在蒂尼鎮的幾個班次  幫著坐火車
A few shifts at Teenytown. Helping with the train.

542
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:03,070
因為我每周在瑞溫頓收容所住三天
'Cause I do three days a week at Rivington House, the hospice.

543
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:05,370
好的秩序很難找到
Good orderly is tough to find.

544
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,570
更難保持
Tougher to keep.

545
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:10,140
垂死的人會打擾你嗎？
Do dying people bother you?

546
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,910
沒有
No.

547
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,510
我們都快死了
We're all dying.

00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:16,520
世界是一個有著新鮮空氣的大型收容所
The world is one big hospice with fresh air.

549
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,780

You said it didn't hurt.

554
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,850
現在不疼了  不是嗎？

555
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:24,680
-感覺我快要死了   -嗯

吃點東西  你會感覺更好
You'll feel better when you eat.

560
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,890
我還是人類嗎？
Am I still human?

561
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,670
你在乎嗎？
Do you care?

568
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,720
是什麼？
What is it?

569
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:09,190
你害怕我
You're scared of me.

570
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:11,890
哦...
Oh...

571
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:16,760
我們愛你勝過世界上任何東西
We love you more than anything in the world.

572
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:19,700
你聽到了嗎？
You hear me?

573
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,170
任何東西
Anything.

574
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,040
晚安  我的甜心
Goodnight, my heart.

575
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:12,650
嘿  讓他來吧
Hey. Let him be.

576
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,290
阿茲雷爾  別管他了
Azreel, leave him be.

577
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,000
伊茲？
Azzie?

578
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,600
伊茲 別這樣
Azzie, come on.

579
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,110
快點 伊茲
Come on. Azzie.

580
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,270
醫生
Doc.

581
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:38,620
是你嗎 醫生？
That you, Doc?

582
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,990
不 我不是醫生
No, I'm not a doctor.

583
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,160
你想讓我給你找個醫生嗎？
Do you want me to get you a doctor?

584
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,790
貓在我床上
The cat's on my bed.

585
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:45,260
噢 嘿 我會把她搬走的
Oh, hey, I'll move her.

586
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,860
不
No.

587
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,030
我知道她會的
I knew she would be.

588
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:53,230
那隻貓似乎總是知道...
That cat always seems to know...

589
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,700
當時間結束的時候
when it's time.

590
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:00,980
-我想是時候了  -沒有
- I guess it's time. - No.

591
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,710
阿茲只是一隻傻乎乎的老貓
It's just Azzie being a silly old cat.

592
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:05,850
不是
Nope.

593
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:08,240
從我到這裏起就是這樣
Been that way ever since I got here.

594
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,320
貓知道
The cat knows

595
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,790
是時候睡覺了
when it's time to go to Sleep.

596
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,810
所有人都知道
Everybody knows that.

597
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:19,320
我要死了
I'm gonna die.

598
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:32,210
是的
Yes.

599
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:33,310
我去叫人
Let me get you someone.

600
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,730
別
No.

601
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:39,270
知道它要來了
Known it was comin'.

602
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,680
不會讓它變的不那麼可怕
Doesn't make it less scary.

603
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:45,120
是的
Yeah.

604
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,350
但也許就像你說的
But maybe it's just like you say,

605
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,290
只是去睡一覺
just going to Sleep.

606
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:53,890
我是說 沒什麼可怕的 只是在睡覺
I mean, there's nothing scary. It's just sleeping.

607
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,300
你是個奇怪的醫生
You're a strange type of doctor.

608
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,100
我告訴過你 我不是醫生
I told you, I'm not a doctor.

609
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,060
噢 我想是的
Oh, I think you are.

610
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:02,900
醫生   睡吧
Doctor Sleep.

611
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:06,240
醫生 我很害怕會受傷 或者遁入黑暗
Doc, I am so scared it's gonna hurt, or be dark,

612
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:09,710
或者...或者什麼都不是 我不想...
or... or be nothing at all. And I don't wanna...

613
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:11,840
沒什麼好怕的
Nothing to be scared of.

614
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,450
只是睡著了
Just going to sleep.

615
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:20,140
最終的  真正的  寧靜的睡眠
Finally, true, restful sleep.

616
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:25,920
哦 謝謝
Oh, thank you.

617
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:30,360
謝謝你  醫生
Thank you, Doc.

618
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:33,100
聽著 我不該在這裏 我去給你拿點...
Look, I shouldn't be here. Let me go get you some...

619
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,370
不  不  不
No, no, No.

620
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:38,130
你在你該在的地方
You're exactly where you should be.

621
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,130
應該
Exactly.

622
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,670
我看到我妻子了
I see my wife.

623
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:15,120
丹  酒鬼
Dan, alcoholic.

624
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:17,330
嘿  丹
Hi, Dan.

625
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:19,970
我不太喜歡演講
I'm not much of a speech guy.

626
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:24,200
我只是想拿著芯片  隨便說點什麼
I just thought I'd hold the chip and talk about whatever popped up.

627
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,460
所以  我來了
So, here I am.

628
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:33,500
我在想我爸爸
And I'm thinkin' about my dad.

629
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:38,650
我在他手裏看到過這樣的籌碼
I saw a chip like this in his hand once.

630
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,650
在他死前幾個月
A couple months before he died.

631
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,580
五個月的籌碼  我很確定
Five month chip, I'm Pretty sure.

632
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:49,960
他喝醉的時候傷害過我一次
He hurt me once when he was drunk.

633
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,220
弄斷了我的胳膊
Broke my arm.

634
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:55,030
然後他就一口氣喝完了
Then he dried right out.

635
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,040
他在我五歲的時候就死了  所以我想瞭解他的方式
He died when I was five, so the only way I got to know him,

636
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:06,150
真正瞭解他的唯一方式  就是在天黑的時候
really got to know him, was when I went dark.

637
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:09,870
當我...當我喝醉的時候...
When I... When I drank to dull the...

638
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:12,990
或者 呃...
or, uh...

639
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:15,320
每當我想打破別人的臉
whenever I wanted to break someone's face,

640
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:20,230
因為喝酒  發脾氣  發怒
'cause the drinking and the temper and the anger,

641
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,030
我身上的這些毛病 也是是他具有的
those things in me were his.

642
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:24,060
通過這些毛病我能瞭解到 關於他的一切
And they were all I could know of him.

643
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:32,410
但現在 好吧 現在我認識的他有點不同了...
But now, well, now I get to know him a little different...

644
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:36,080
因為他也曾站在這樣的房間裏...
'cause he also stood in a room like this once...

645
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:40,540
想讓我和我媽媽好起來
wanting to get well for me and my mom.

646
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:44,650
他手裏拿著籌碼
And he held the chip in his hand

647
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,120
籌碼說五個月
and the chip said five months,

648
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,620
在那天 他...
and on that day, he...

649
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:51,380
在這之前...
Before it all...

650
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,560
好吧 那天 他想要的一切
Well, on that day, all he wanted in the world

651
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:57,920
就是站在我站的地方
was to stand where I'm standing now.

652
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,060
我在這裏
And here I am,

653
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:05,230
所以謝謝你們二位  我想
so thank you for us both, I guess.

654
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:08,380
這是給傑克·托倫斯的
This is for Jack Torrance.

655
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,050
嘿  查理
Hey, Charlie.

656
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:32,690
醫生？
Doc?

657
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:41,030
我想我不需要問你為什麼在這個時候來這裏
Guess I don't need to ask why you're here at this hour.

658
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,440
你有疼痛嗎？
Do you have pain?

659
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:48,240
你想讓我讓克勞德特給你帶藥嗎？
Do you want me to get Claudette to bring you a pill?

660
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:52,350
吃藥不重要
Pill won't matter.

661
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:57,060
我聽到了家裏的電話
I heard about these house calls.

662
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:02,020
《睡眠博士》真是一部多麼好的電影啊！
What a visit from Doctor Sleep really is.

663
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,730
你看到什麼了 醫生？
So, what do you see, Doc?

664
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:17,080
我看到你的雙胞胎兒子了
I see your twin sons.

665
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,400
四歲
Four years old.

666
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,500
你能看到他們嗎？
Can you see them?

667
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:22,610
我能
I do.

668
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,390
農場拖拉機
Farmall tractor.

669
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:28,580
座位上有一把條紋的傘
A striped umbrella over the seat.

670
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:31,280
五歲
Five years old,

671
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,090
拉著一輛紅色的貨車
pulling a red wagon.

672
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:40,070
上帝啊  看看這個
Lord, look at that.

673
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:42,300
就像一副牌
Like a deck of cards.

674
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:44,060
一切都不正常
All out of order.

675
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:49,530
我不怕地獄  醫生
I'm not scared of hell, Doc.

676
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:56,380
我過著體面的生活
Uh, I lived a decent life.

677
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:59,620
反正我不認為有這樣的地方
I don't think there is such a place anyway.

678
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,380
我想我不害怕...
I guess I'm scared...

679
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:04,820
沒什麼可害怕的
there's Nothing.

680
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,820
以前也沒有
There was nothing before.

681
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:16,160
那麼 如果之後那邊也沒什麼可害怕的
So, what if there's nothing after?

682
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:19,760
我們不會結束的  查理
We don't end, Charlie.

683
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,140
我當然知道
I know that for certain.

684
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:25,100
我不知道還有什麼...
I don't know much else...

685
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,640
但我知道我們不會結束
but I know that we don't end.

686
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:34,720
藍莓
Blueberries.

687

我能嘗到我媽媽以前常吃的藍莓
I can taste blueberries my mother used to grow.

688
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:42,260
你能嘗嘗嗎？

689
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:46,230
-是的  我可以  -啊
- Yeah, I can. - Ah.

01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:45,550
很接近   -嗯
- Gettin' closer. - Hmm.

711
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:48,490
我想他在愛荷華州的某個地方
He's somewhere in Iowa, I think.

712
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:52,250
一旦我確定我找到了他  我們都會進行一次愉快的長途旅行
We'll all take a nice long road trip once I'm sure I've found him.

713
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:57,330
在我做之前  我們...
Until I do, we...

714
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:59,900
你得打開一個罐子 羅西
You gotta open a canister, Rosie.

715
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,900
六個月前我們拿走蒸汽了  克勞  六個月不算什麼
We took steam six months ago, Crow. Six months is nothing.

716
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:08,010
特拉華州的那個孩子不是那麼性感  而且已經出現了
That kid in Delaware wasn't so steamy and it's already showing.

717
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:09,810
你看到爺爺的頭髮了嗎？
You see Grampa Flick's hair, yeah?

718
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:11,280
是的
Yeah.

719
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,850
我覺得他不舒服
I don't think he's well.

720
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:15,580
自從尼克松上任以來 格拉姆帕·弗利克一直不太好
Grampa Flick hasn't been well since Nixon was in office.

721
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:17,850
我知道
I know.

722
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:20,780
但我們需要吃飯  我們所有人
But we need to eat. All of us.

723
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:24,290
罐子放低了嗎？
Are the canisters low?

724
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:25,860
當然沒有
Course not.

725
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,950
只是不需要浪費一個  如果你接近死亡的話
Just no need to waste one if you're close to the kill.

726
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:32,330
-羅西  -嗯？
- Rosie. - Mm-hmm?

727
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,790
我可能需要它來找到他
I might need it just to find him.

728
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,370
世界上以前有更多的蒸汽 你知道嗎？
There used to be more steam in the world, you know?

729
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,910
別傻了 快點
Oh, don't be daft. Come on.

730
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:43,640
就像魯比斯說的
That's like when rubes say,

731
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:45,980
「50年前 人們曾經更友善 」
"50 years ago, people used to be more neighborly."

732
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,710
但這是真的 羅西
But it's true, Rosie.

733
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:49,850
外面的蒸汽少了 而且也變弱了
There's less steam out there, and it's weaker, too.

734
01:01:49,870 --> 01:01:51,650
我不知道是因為他們的手機 還是飲食
I don't know if it's their cell phones or diets

735
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,350
或是他們的Netflix
or their Netflix or what,

736
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:55,460
但這些天我沒有聞到很多氣味
but I am not picking up many scents these days,

737
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:56,990
我做的那些 羅西 只是不是...
and the ones that I do, Rosie, are just not that...

738
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:59,430
今晚我會打開一個罐子讓大家都過來
I'll open a canister tonight to tide everyone over.

739
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:00,690
感謝
Thank you.

740
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,440
-你知道的  羅西   -我知道什麼？
- You know it, Rosie. - I know What?

741
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,470
所以你每天都在這裏
It's why you're up here every day.

742
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:14,100
所以不管你跟別人說什麼 你總是在這裏
It's why you're always up here no matter what you tell the others.

743
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:15,810
世界不是那麼潮濕
The world's not as steamy

744
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:17,930
你在找一隻鯨魚
and you are looking for a whale.

745
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:09,130
噢 看著這孩子 19號
Oh, watch this kid. Number 19.

746
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:11,030
那孩子是天生的
That kid is a natural.

747
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:13,000
他每次都能擊中球
He hits the ball every time.

748
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,400
就像他能讀懂投手的心思
Like he can read the pitcher's mind.

749
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:17,360
嗯 是這樣嗎？
Hmm. Is that right?

750
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,110
看到了嗎？你看 總有一天 一個天才球探
See? You watch, one of these days, one of those talent scouts

751
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:31,410
會聽到布拉德的風聲  你看著
is gonna get wind of Brad there. You watch.

752
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,710
嘿  19歲
Hey, 19,

753
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:57,940
剛看了你的遊戲
just saw your game.

754
01:03:57,970 --> 01:03:59,980
你已經為專業做好了準備
You are ready for the majors.

755
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,920
-打得好   -謝謝
- Well played. - Thanks.

756
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:03,720
嘿  你回家嗎？
Hey, you headin' home?

757
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:06,990
你想跳進來嗎？我載你一程
You wanna hop in? I'll give you a ride.

758
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:09,120
不用了  真的很近
No, it's real close.

759
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:10,150
我沒事
I'm Good.

760
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,760
沒關係的
It's okay.

761
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:17,620
我們是朋友  你想跳進來  我們會帶你回家的
We're friends. You wanna hop in. We'll take you right home.

762
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:20,590
你可以帶我回家
You can take me right home.

763
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:23,090
你相信我
You trust me.

764
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:25,200
我相信你
I trust you.

765
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,540
不！不！求你了！
No! No, please! No!

766
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:16,220
不！請讓我走
No! Please let me go.

767
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:19,720
拜託  我不會說的  拜託了  求你了！
Please, I won't tell. Please. Please!

768
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:25,530
19號
Number 19.

769
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,030
孩子  你很棒
Kid, you were Good.

770
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:29,030
不！
No!

771
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,110
不 請讓我走
No, please let me go.

772
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:39,250
我不會說的 我不會說的 拜託了
I won't tell. I won't tell. Please.

773
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:40,680
沒關係的
It's okay.

774
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:41,870
求你了
Please.

775
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:46,590
啊
Ah.

776
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,050
你要傷害我嗎？
Are you gonna hurt me?

777
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:53,790
是的
Yes.

778
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:55,590
不！
No!

779
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:59,330
疼痛能淨化蒸汽
Pain purifies steam.

780
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:02,830
害怕  所以  你明白
Fear, too, so, you understand.

781
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,260
噓
Shh.

782
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:51,650
住手！
Stop!

783
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:03,790
住手！
Stop!

784
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,300
住手！
Stop!

785
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,590
住手！
Stop!

786
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:11,200
住手  怪物
Stop, monster.

787
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,970
住手  住手
Stop. Stop.

788
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,270
是什麼？
What is it?

789
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:34,390
住手！
No! Stop!

790
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:42,300
-阿布拉！阿布拉！ -嘿 嘿 嘿！
- Abra! Abra! - Hey, hey, hey!

791
01:07:42,330 --> 01:07:44,270
寶貝 寶貝 醒醒 醒醒 甜心
Sweetie. Sweetheart, wake up. Wake up, sweetheart.

792
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:45,440
-阿布拉  醒醒！-嘿  嘿  嘿
- Abra, wake up! - Hey, hey, Hey.

793
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:46,760
-打開！ 開！ -停止它！
- Abra! Abra! - Stop it!

794
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:57,340
上帝啊
Jesus.

795
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:43,690
好吧
Okay.

796
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,020
好吧
Okay.

797
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,390
好吧
Okay.

798
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:39,240
他媽的 我以為他還有幾分鐘
Damn. I thought he had another few minutes in him.

799
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:45,160
好了 準備好了嗎？
Okay, ready?

800
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,970
他們殺了他
They killed him.

801
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,270
他們殺了他
They killed him.

802
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:09,070
沒關係的
It's okay.

803
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,430
我們有個旁觀者
We had a looker.

804
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:43,550
今晚？
Tonight?

805
01:10:43,570 --> 01:10:45,120
嗯
Mm-Hmm.

806
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:46,310
是的
Yeah.

807
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:49,290
大蒸汽？
Big steam?

808
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:51,350
噢 親愛的 它很大
Oh, honey, it was huge.

809
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:54,260
在哪裏？
Where?

810
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:57,220
我想是東海岸
East Coast, I think.

811
01:10:59,290 --> 01:11:03,390
你是說有人在1500英里外看見我們？
You're saying someone looked in from 1,500 miles away?

812
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:06,400
或許更進一步
Maybe further.

813
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:09,880
男孩還是女孩？
Boy or girl?

814
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:11,610
女孩  我想
Girl, I think.

815
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:15,010
她跑得太快了
She was out of there so fast.

816
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,920
但我發誓  烏鴉爸爸
But I swear, Crow Daddy,

817
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:21,450
我很久沒有那種感覺
I haven't felt power like that,

818
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:24,010
像那樣的原始力量
raw power like that

819
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:27,590
很久了
in so long.

820
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:29,900
我們得調查一下
Then we need to look into it.

821
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:32,000
-越快越好   -是的
- Sooner the better. - Yeah.

822
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:33,600
如果她父母嚇壞了
Case her parents freak out,

823
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:36,170
送她去看心理醫生
send her to a psychiatrist.

824
01:11:36,190 --> 01:11:39,340
你知道 他們給她吃藥 可能會毀了蒸汽
You know, they get her on pills, could ruin the steam.

825
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,470
可能會讓她...
Might muffle her just...

826
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,340
不 把帕克斯給了這孩子
No, giving Paxil to this kid,

827
01:11:42,370 --> 01:11:46,010
就像把一塊薩蘭包裹在探照燈上
it's like throwing a piece of Saran Wrap over a searchlight.

828
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:48,050
我不知道她在哪
I don't know where she is,

829
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:50,640
但等她回來 她就會回來
but when she comes back, and she'll be back,

830
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:54,250
我會準備好的 親愛的
oh, I'll be ready, honey.

831
01:11:56,650 --> 01:11:58,310
我會準備好的
I'll be ready.

832
01:12:59,270 --> 01:13:01,020
早上好
Morning.

833
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,150
早上好
Morning.

834
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,020
你猜怎麼著
Guess what.

835
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:07,030
我交了個新朋友
I made a new friend.

836
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:08,690
他叫丹
His name's Dan.

837
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:10,650
是嗎？在學校？
Yeah? At school?

838
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,730
不是  他不住在這裏
No. He doesn't live here.

839
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,630
我是說  他住得很近
I mean, he lives close.

840
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:17,100
弗雷澤 我想
Frazier, I think.

841
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:18,540
沒什麼大不了的
No big deal.

842
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,670
阿布斯 你沒事吧？
Abs, are you okay?

843
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,140
昨晚 我...
Last night, I...

844
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:24,180
好吧
I'm Okay.

845
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,710
很抱歉
Sorry about that.

846
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:29,020
我知道你的頭有時就像收音機
I know that head of yours is like a radio sometimes.

847
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:33,050
你還可以找到一些奇怪的電台
And you pick up some weird stations.

848
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,110
這一點都不奇怪
Nothing weird like that.

849
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:36,580
不會了
Not anymore.

850
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:47,570
上帝啊
My God.

851
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:50,170
我要學習 如果我不學習...
I've gotta study. If I don't study...

852
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:53,710
跑步遊戲 切換到11號...
Running play. Hand-off to 11 and...

853
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:55,730
如果我拿不到這些教練會殺了我的
Coach is gonna kill me if I don't get these.

854
01:13:57,230 --> 01:13:59,240
他為什麼不喜歡我？
Why doesn't he like me?

855
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:01,180
我的頭髮？我應該換頭髮
My hair? I should change my hair.

856
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,750
怪物又盯著我看了
The freak is staring at me again.

857
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:04,620
她在看什麼？
What is she staring at?

858
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:05,640
怪胎
Freak.

859
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:46,590
嘿  阿巴杜
Hey, Abba-doo.

860
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:47,790
嘿  爸爸
Hey, Dad.

861
01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:49,420
學校好嗎？
School okay?

862
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:51,760
書怎麼樣了？
How's the book?

863
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:53,730
很好  是的  進展順利
Good. Yeah, going Good.

864
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,800
我在寫查爾斯頓和黑底
I'm writing about Charleston and Black Bottom.

865
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:57,700
是啊 這是...
Yeah, it's...

866
01:14:57,730 --> 01:15:00,370
感覺好像......我要開始做作業了
- It's feeling like... - I'm going to start my homework.

867
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:04,140
好吧  很好  很好  親愛的
Okay. Good. That's good, sweetie.

868
01:15:04,170 --> 01:15:06,280
想想哈佛三年後
Think Harvard in three years.

869
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:07,510
我們拭目以待
We'll see.

870
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:09,340
是的  我們拭目以待
Yeah. We will see.

871
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:11,330
非常感謝
Thanks so much

872
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:12,960
今天和我們一起購物
for shopping with us today.

873
01:18:12,990 --> 01:18:15,660
記住 我們總是新鮮的 只是為了你
And remember, we're always fresh, just for you.

874
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:47,320
好吧  你好
Well, hi there.

875
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,770
出去！
Get out!

876
01:18:57,830 --> 01:18:59,700
出去！從我腦子裏滾出去！
Get out! Get out of my head!

877
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:02,710
出去！
Get out!

878
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:14,930
-女士 你沒事吧？ -不！沒事
- Ma'am, are you okay? - No! No.

879
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:16,690
是的  我很好
Yeah, I'm fine.

880
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:19,400
我很好
I'm fine.

881
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:27,760
上帝啊
Jesus.

882
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,640
丹諾？
Danno?

883
01:19:30,670 --> 01:19:31,980
丹？
Dan?

884
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,480
起來  站起來  丹
Get up. Stand up, Dan.

885
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:35,710
來吧 丹諾
Come on, DanNo.

886
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:39,690
-發生了什麼事？-你剛剛摔倒了
- What happened? - Well, you just dropped.

887
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:42,450
我以為你中風了 托尼是誰？
Thought you was having a stroke. Who's Tony?

888
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:45,490
What?  什麼？ What? What?
What? What? What? What?

889
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:47,070
你一直說 「請幫幫我 托尼 」
You kept saying, "Please help me, Tony."

890
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,030
哦
Oh.

891
01:19:50,050 --> 01:19:52,860
我很抱歉
Well, I'm Sorry about that.

892
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,010
蘿西？
Rosie?

893
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:26,770
我們有麻煩了
We've got a problem.

894
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:29,000
-跟我說 -那個旁觀者
- Talk to me. - The looker?

895
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:31,140
是啊  她又找到我了
Yeah, she found me again.

896
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,670
-怎麼做到的？ -我不知道
- How? - I don't knOw.

897
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:34,070
我不在乎
I don't care.

898
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:37,680
我們得抓住她  克勞  我們必須這麼做
We have to have her, Crow. We have to.

899
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:39,840
她知道你是誰嗎？我們在哪裏？
Does she know who you are? Where we are?

900
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:44,020
不 我不知道 我不認為...這不重要...聽著
No, I don't know. I don't think... That's not the important... Look.

901
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,580
-我說她很有活力  對吧   -嗯哼
- I said she's huge steam, right? - Mm-Hmm.

902
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:48,890
是啊  比那還要強大
Yeah, it's even bigger than that.

903
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:50,590
我試圖控制她
I tried to turn around in her

904
01:20:50,610 --> 01:20:53,690
她把我從她身上轟了出來  而且輕而易舉
and she blew me out of her like I was nothing.

905
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:56,590
-胡說  -沒有  從來沒有發生在我身上 從來沒有
- Bullshit. - No. Never happened to me, ever.

906
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:58,420
我應該說那是不可能的
I would have said that was impossible.

907
01:21:00,190 --> 01:21:02,190
她是食物還是我們把她變成吸血鬼？
Is she food or do we turn her?

908
01:21:03,230 --> 01:21:04,870
我們不能把她變成吸血鬼
We don't turn her.

909
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:06,470
羅西  你確定嗎？
Rosie, are you sure?

910
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:07,970
如果她就是你說的那樣 那麼...
If she's what you say she is, then...

911
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,010
那我們就不想讓任何人在結中擁有這種力量
Then we don't want anyone with that power in the Knot.

912
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:13,000
天啊  想想吧
Jeez. Think about it.

913
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,550
如果她兩個都不是呢？
What if she's neither?

914
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:23,520
你什麼意思？
What do you mean?

915
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:26,020
我是說  我們不殺她
I mean, we don't kill her.

916
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:27,820
我們不會把她變成吸血鬼
And We don't turn her.

917
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:30,860
想想一頭牛
Think of a cow.

918
01:21:30,890 --> 01:21:33,590
你殺了它  只能給你一個月的肉
You butcher one, that gives you meat for a month.

919
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:36,760
讓它活著
Keep it alive,

920
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:39,910
好好照顧它
take care of it,

921
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:42,770
它可以提供給你好幾年的牛奶
it gives you milk for years.

922
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,880
-羅西  我們從來沒試過  -我知道
- Rosie, we've never tried that. - I know.

923
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,880
因為蒸汽頭是危險的
Because a steam head is dangerous.

924
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:48,580
你讓它活著  可能會很危險
You keep it alive, it could be dangerous.

925
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:51,150
我知道  關鍵是...
I know. The point...

926
01:21:51,170 --> 01:21:53,750
關鍵是 克勞
The point, Crow,

927
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:55,950
她是大白鯨
is she's the great white whale.

928
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:58,550
我想要她
And I want her.

929
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,820
我要她
I want her.

930
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:05,220
我他媽的想要她
I fucking want her.

931
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:17,680
祝你今天愉快
Have a great day.

932
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:18,870
你也是
You, too.

933
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:47,790
嘿
Hi.

934
01:23:57,970 --> 01:23:59,230
比利
Billy.

935
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:19,230
你能聽到我的聲音
You can hear me.

936
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:21,790
我們用外面的聲音  好嗎？
Let's use our outside voices, all right?

937
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:24,800
你找到我了？
You tracked me down?

938
01:24:24,830 --> 01:24:29,410
這比我想像的要容易  就像GPS  但在我腦子裏
It was easier than I thought. Like GPS, but in my head.

939
01:24:29,430 --> 01:24:34,710
聽著  我不是有意冒犯  但這個年代  一個成年人
Look, I don't mean any offense, but this day and age, a grown man

940
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:36,680
和一個十幾歲的女孩坐在公園的長凳上...
sitting with a teenage girl on a park bench...

941
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:39,380
我是阿布拉·斯通  如果有人問你  你是我叔叔
I'm Abra Stone. And if anyone asks, you're my uncle.

942
01:24:39,410 --> 01:24:40,940
丹叔叔
Uncle Dan.

943
01:24:43,410 --> 01:24:46,890
這甚至不是謊言  完全不是
And that's not even a lie. Not totally.

944
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:49,030
我們還有其他關係
We're related in other ways.

945
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:50,890
你很神奇  就像我一樣
You're magic, like me.

946
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,290
我不懂魔法
I don't know about magic.

947
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:56,900
我...
I...

948
01:24:56,930 --> 01:24:58,440
我總是叫它閃亮
I always called it the shining.

949
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,330
是啊  我們都很光彩照人
And, yeah, we both shine.

950
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:02,970
你父母知道嗎？
Do your parents know?

951
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,700
關於我的光芒？
About my shine?

952
01:25:06,170 --> 01:25:07,480
他們很害怕
They're scared of it,

953
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:10,080
但他們認為它已經消失了 除了一些東西
but they think it's gone except for a few things.

954
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:13,490
就像 我媽媽有時讓我幫她找到丟失的東西
Like, my mom sometimes asks me to help her find something she's lost.

955
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:15,390
上個月 是她的車鑰匙
Last month, it was her car keys.

956
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:18,220
她把它們丟在我爸爸車庫的工作台上
She left them on my dad's worktable in the garage.

957
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:20,990
但他們不談論這件事
But they don't talk about it.

958
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:24,160
或者如果我使用它  他們會用不同的眼光看我
Or if I use it, they look at me different.

959
01:25:24,190 --> 01:25:25,900
或者什麼都不做
Or not at all.

960
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,370
一整天都
Not for a whole day once.

961
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:30,260
不敢直視我的眼睛
Wouldn't look me in the eYes.

962
01:25:32,430 --> 01:25:34,740
所以  我盡量不用它
So, I try not to use it.

963
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:36,870
因為如果人們發現了
Because if people find out,

964
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:38,330
「伊克 一個怪胎 」你知道嗎？
"Eek, a freak." You know?

965
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:42,050
相信你知道
Sure you know.

966
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:44,010
你也盡量不要用它
You try not to use it, too.

967
01:25:46,110 --> 01:25:49,120
你已經試了很久了
You've been trying a long time,

968
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:52,380
她也不看你的眼睛
and she couldn't look you in your eyes either.

969
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:58,130
當我還是個孩子的時候 我不
When I was a kid, I didn't

970
01:25:58,150 --> 01:26:01,000
理解什麼光明  我叫它托尼 」
understand the shining. I called it "Tony."

971
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:03,330
我以為他是我想像中的朋友
I thought he was my imaginary friend.

972
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,400
我以為你是我想像中的朋友...
I thought you were my imaginary friend...

973
01:26:06,430 --> 01:26:08,500
很長一段時間都這樣
for a long time.

974
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:13,310
我們有多少人在外面？
How many of us are out there?

975
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:15,310
很多人都有一點閃光點
There's a lot of people who have a little bit of shine,

976
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:16,950
他們甚至不知道
they don't even know it.

977
01:26:16,970 --> 01:26:18,280
他們似乎總是帶著鮮花回家
They always seem to come home

978
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:20,120
當他們的妻子傷心的時候
with flowers when their wives are sad,

979
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:22,420
或者他們沒有學習但在學校考試上考的很好
or they do well on the school test they didn't study for.

980
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:24,290
但我只遇到兩三個人
But I only met two or three people

981
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:26,520
在我的一生當中  誰知道他們的閃光點
in my whole life who knew they shined.

982
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,230
棒球男孩閃光點
The baseball boy shined.

983
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:33,160
他叫布拉德利·特雷弗
His name was Bradley Trevor.

984
01:26:36,330 --> 01:26:38,470
這些人...
These people...

985
01:26:38,490 --> 01:26:41,300
不管怎樣 他們看起來像人 他們帶走了他
they look like people anyway, they took him.

986
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:44,370
他們吃了他
And they ate him.

987
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,370
他們吃了他的光
They ate his shine.

988
01:26:48,270 --> 01:26:50,850
你能感覺到嗎？
You could feel it?

989
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:53,280
他們也能感覺到我
And they could feel me, I think.

990
01:26:53,310 --> 01:26:55,840
他們中至少有一個做到了  一位女士
At least one of them did. A lady.

991
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,950
戴帽子的女士
The lady with the hat.

992
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:03,460
我想找到他們  阻止他們
I wanna find them, stop them,

993
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:07,500
因為我認為  他們也對很多其他孩子做了這種事
because I think they've done this to a lot of other kids, too.

994
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,960
所以 我得做點什麼 對吧？
So, I have to do something, right?

995
01:27:10,930 --> 01:27:13,100
你為什麼來這裏？
Why did you come here?

996
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:14,540
為什麼是我？
Why me?

997
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,270
因為你能聽到我說話
Because you can hear me.

998
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:19,040
你應該相信我  你也會發光的
You'd believe me. You shine, too.

999
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:20,870
他們傷害了像我們這樣的人
And they hurt people like us.

1000
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:24,540
我是說  你會怎麼做？
I mean, what would you do?

1001
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:29,220
如果你能得到一些他的東西
If you could get something of his,

1002
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:30,560
如果你能去愛荷華州...
if you could go to Iowa...

1003
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:32,360
-喔 等等 -我可以幫你找到他
- Whoa, hang on. - I can help you find him.

1004
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:34,190
然後他的父母會知道他在哪
Then his parents would know where he was.

1005
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:36,190
他們至少可以把他埋起來
They could bury him right, at least.

1006
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:38,330
我們還可以拿到他的手套
We could also get his glove.

1007
01:27:38,350 --> 01:27:40,100
如果我能摸到那隻手套  我就能追蹤他們
If I can touch that glove, I can track them.

1008
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:41,530
冷靜  冷靜
Easy. Easy.

1009
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:44,200
因為巴瑞 我想那是他的名字
Because Barry the Chunk, I think that was his name,

1010
01:27:44,230 --> 01:27:46,370
在他們殺了他之前
for a while, before they killed him,

1011
01:27:46,390 --> 01:27:48,160
他戴著它
he was wearing it.

1012
01:27:59,610 --> 01:28:02,420
阿布拉  回家吧
Abra, go home.

1013
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:05,360
想想你的學校  想想你的父母
Think about your school. Think about your parents.

1014
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:07,360
想想你的餘生
Think about the rest of your life.

1015
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:09,460
別追這些人
Don't chase these people.

1016
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:11,400
別惹他們生氣
Don't aggravate them.

1017
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:14,470
不管你做什麼  都不要引起他們的注意
And whatever you do, don't attract their attention.

1018
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:16,300
不要發光
Don't shine.

1019
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:18,040
找到什麼 任何東西...
Find something, anything...

1020
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:21,970
好吧 幾乎任何事 阻止你的光芒
Well, almost anything, to stop that shine of yours.

1021
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,640
低著頭  保持低調  向上帝祈禱
Keep your head down, keep your shine down and hope to God

1022
01:28:24,670 --> 01:28:27,310
這些人或任何類似的人
that these people or anything like them,

1023
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:30,250
他們就看不到你
that they don't see you.

1024
01:28:30,270 --> 01:28:32,950
如果他們看到你  他們就會回來
If they see you, they come back.

1025
01:28:32,970 --> 01:28:34,480
你聽到了嗎
Abra, do You hear me?

1026
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:37,280
他們會回來
They come back.

1027
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:42,180
把頭低下  注意安全
Keep your head down. Stay safe.

1028
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:45,560
我很抱歉
I'm Sorry.

1029
01:28:58,530 --> 01:29:00,280
那一年的情況很艱難
Things were tough that year.

1030
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:02,100
很多演員都失業了
A lot of actors were out of work.

1031
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:06,150
嘿 夥計們
Hey, fellas.

1032
01:29:06,170 --> 01:29:06,950
埃爾默·富德那個雜耍明星來了
Here comes Elmer Fudd that big vaudeville star.

1033
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:08,490
是什麼？
What is it?

1034
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:10,180
哦 沒什麼 醫生
Oh, it's nothing, Doc.

1035
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:12,690
沒什麼
It's nothing.

1036
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:14,380
想著爸爸
Thinking about Dad.

1037
01:29:17,650 --> 01:29:18,950
不 我沒有
No, I'm not.

1038
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:22,220
你就是 你不會想的
You are. And you don't want to.

1039
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:29,170
別擔心我 醫生
Don't worry about me, Doc.

1040
01:29:29,670 --> 01:29:30,670
我很好
I'm fine.

1041
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:34,940
我們很好
We're fine.

1042
01:30:12,570 --> 01:30:14,440
嘿 阿齊
Hey, Azzie.

1043
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:29,430
今晚你的電話線路不通
You got your wires crossed tonight.

1044
01:30:32,090 --> 01:30:33,630
房間是空的 阿茲
That room's empty, Az.

1045
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:40,570
房間裏沒有人
There's no one in that room.

1046
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:51,250
哇！等等 醫生
Whoa! Hang on, Doc.

1047
01:30:52,150 --> 01:30:53,150
迪克
Dick.

1048
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,230
哦 對不起
Oh, I'm so Sorry.

1049
01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:57,530
我...我...我以為是...
I... I... I thought it was...

1050
01:30:57,550 --> 01:30:59,460
我以為我是從「俯視」來的
Thought I was from the Overlook.

1051
01:30:59,490 --> 01:31:01,630
差點把我關起來
Almost locked me up.

1052
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:04,330
還有老鬼來看他們嗎？
Still getting visits from them old ghosts?

1053
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:06,200
不 好多年沒有了
No, not for years.

1054
01:31:06,230 --> 01:31:09,510
霍勒斯·德溫特是最後一個 他西裝上的紙屑
Horace Derwent was the last one, confetti on his suit.

1055
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:11,540
說 「派對很棒 不是嗎？」
Said, "Great party, isn't it?"

1056
01:31:11,570 --> 01:31:14,850
我給他拿出了一個盒子 在他臉上咧著嘴大笑
Shit-eating grin on his face till I pulled out a box for him.

1057
01:31:14,870 --> 01:31:17,650
那笑容消失得很快
That grin went fast.

1058
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:20,420
嘿 那時候我從沒想過要問你
Hey, it never occurred to me to ask you back then.

1059
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:22,250
他們在那些盒子裏會發生什麼？
What happens to them in those boxes?

1060
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:23,620
他們死在那兒嗎？
Do they die in there?

1061
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:25,050
你在乎嗎？
Do you care?

1062
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:30,490
我想你了
I missed you.

1063
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:31,690
已經很久了嗎？
Has it been a long time?

1064
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:35,500
不好說
Can't tell.

1065
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:39,500
這個世界對我來說是一個夢
This world is a dream of a dream to me now.

1066
01:31:39,530 --> 01:31:42,240
八年了  再多說幾句一點
Eight years. Little more.

1067
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:44,310
上次我見到你
Last time I saw you,

1068
01:31:44,330 --> 01:31:46,200
你在最底層
you was at the bottom.

1069
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,350
你現在看上去不錯
You look better now.

1070
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:51,520
你為什麼在這裏？
Why are you here?

1071
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:54,210
我來是因為一切都來了
I'm here because it all comes 'round.

1072
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:56,810
卡是個預警  醫生
Ka's a wheel, Doc.

1073
01:31:59,150 --> 01:32:00,530
你聽著 孩子
You listen, son.

1074
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:03,630
在這裏很痛苦  所以我只說一次
It hurts to be here, so I'll only say it once.

1075
01:32:03,650 --> 01:32:07,130
這些空虛的魔鬼曾經找到過你
These empty devils ever found you

1076
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:08,770
當你還是個孩子的時候
when you was a tyke,

1077
01:32:08,790 --> 01:32:11,270
如果他們發現了你
if they'd even sniffed you,

1078
01:32:11,290 --> 01:32:13,240
你早就死了
you'd be long dead.

1079
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:18,210
它們在陸地上就像皮膚上的癌癥
They're on the land like a cancer on the skin.

1080
01:32:18,230 --> 01:32:20,780
有一次  他們在沙漠裏騎駱駝
Once, they rode camels in the desert.

1081
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:24,410
有一次  他們駕駛大篷車穿越東歐
Once, they drove caravans across Eastern Europe.

1082
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:27,580
他們吃尖叫聲
They eat screams,

1083
01:32:27,610 --> 01:32:30,220
喝痛苦
and drink pain,

1084
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:32,880
他們注意到了那個小女孩
and they've noticed that little girl.

1085
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:35,550
他們可能會殺了她
They might kill her,

1086
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:38,490
可能會讓她
might turn her,

1087
01:32:40,390 --> 01:32:43,270
或者把她養著  直到使用完為止
or might keep her till she's all used up,

1088
01:32:43,290 --> 01:32:44,700
那將是非常糟糕的
and that'd be worst of all.

1089
01:32:44,730 --> 01:32:46,560
你不能讓他們這麼做
You can't let 'em.

1090
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:50,910
為什麼是我？
Why me?

1091
01:32:50,930 --> 01:32:53,340
因為她找到了你
Because she found you.

1092
01:32:53,370 --> 01:32:56,880
因為她出現了  該死  博士  為什麼是我?
Because she showed up. Hell, Doc, Why me?

1093
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:59,420
有天你剛走進我的廚房
You just walked on into my kitchen one day,

1094
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:00,780
我還在忙碌著
and I'm still on the hook.

1095
01:33:00,810 --> 01:33:02,640
我該怎麼辦？
What the hell am I supposed to do?

1096
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:07,350
給她想要的東西
Get her what she asked for.

1097
01:33:09,590 --> 01:33:11,690
你不會再見到我了  醫生
You won't see me again, Doc.

1098
01:33:12,690 --> 01:33:14,660
這是我最後的夢想
This is my last dream.

1099
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:24,740
在我看來你成長的很好  孩子
It seems to me you grew up fine, son,

1100
01:33:24,770 --> 01:33:26,540
但你還欠著債
but you still owe a debt.

1101
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:32,840
付錢吧
Pay it.

1102
01:33:46,820 --> 01:33:48,720
上帝啊  該死  什麼？
God, damn it. What?

1103
01:33:51,730 --> 01:33:53,610
抱歉  打擾了
Hey. Sorry to interrupt.

1104
01:33:53,630 --> 01:33:56,470
我告訴過你 「不要分心 」不是嗎？
I told you, "no distractions." Didn't I?

1105
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:58,440
沒什麼吃的 沒什麼喝的
Nothing to eat, nothing to drink.

1106
01:33:58,470 --> 01:34:01,680
只要平靜  安靜和冥想
Just peace, quiet, and meditation.

1107
01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:05,520
今晚我得使出渾身解數來對付她  克魯
I need all my wits for her tonight, Crow.

1108
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:07,910
所以我才在這裏 我發現了一些東西
That's why I'm here. I found something.

1109
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:18,830
「地震有多小？
"How small can an earthquake be?

1110
01:34:18,850 --> 01:34:21,570
很小 如果裏奇蘭法院的人
Pretty small, if the people of Richland Court,

1111
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:26,300
一條短的安妮斯頓街  盡頭是薩科河  是值得相信的
a short Anniston street that dead-ends at the Saco River, are to be believed.

1112
01:34:26,330 --> 01:34:27,770
星期二深夜
Late Tuesday night,

1113
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:29,740
幾名居民報告說  街道上有震感
several residents of the street reported a tremor

1114
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,640
窗戶和地板都有響聲
that rattled windows, shook floors,

1115
01:34:31,670 --> 01:34:35,410
玻璃器皿也從架子上掉了下來
and sent glassware tumbling from the shelves.

1116
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:39,420
儘管在倫瑟姆的地質調查中心
Although the Geological Survey Center in Wrentham

1117
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:42,510
據報道 上週二新英格蘭地區沒有發生地震 」
reports there were no temblors in New England last Tuesday."

1118
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:44,820
你覺得呢？
What do you think?

1119
01:34:44,850 --> 01:34:46,820
我想 也許吧
I think, maybe.

1120
01:34:46,850 --> 01:34:51,030
我不是百分之百 但我覺得有50%
I'm not a hundred percent, but I'll take fifty-fifty.

1121
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:52,360
如果那是她...
If that's actually her...

1122
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:53,900
裏奇蘭法院
Richland Court.

1123
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:55,970
她做到了  震動了整個新罕布什爾的街道...
She did that, shook a whole street in New Hampshire...

1124
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:58,770
有一個值得關注的地方 不僅僅是一個城鎮 還有一條街道
Having a place to actually focus on, not just a town, but a street,

1125
01:34:58,790 --> 01:35:01,800
今晚對我來說會很輕鬆

1126
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:03,970
做的好
Good catch.

1127
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:11,910
你想怎麼對付她？
How you coming at her?

1128
01:35:14,010 --> 01:35:15,580
好吧  她會睡著的
Well, she'll be aSleep.

1129
01:35:17,010 --> 01:35:20,960
我只想四處看看 看看她是不是
I'll just wanna look around, see if she is.

1130
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:24,390
像小蟲子一樣 提出一些建議
Plant some suggestions, like little worms.

1131
01:35:25,490 --> 01:35:28,030
讓他們去挖洞吧
Let them burrow.

1132
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:31,760
一百條蟲子圍繞著她親愛的朋友 結
A hundred worms about her dear friends, the Knot.

1133
01:35:33,090 --> 01:35:35,540
當我們到達時
And when we roll up,

1134
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:39,570
她會很高興見到我們的  她會跳上車的
she'll be so happy to see us, she'll just hop right in the van.

1135
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,080
-如果她這麼做...-嗯？
- If she did this... - Mm-hmm?

1136
01:35:46,110 --> 01:35:48,790
...真的震動了整條街
...really shook a whole street,

1137
01:35:48,810 --> 01:35:51,090
我覺得你應該小心
I think you should be careful.

1138
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:52,810
她是個小女孩
She's a little girl.

1139
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:00,900
你一直都是女王婊子
And you are the queen bitch of all time.

1140
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:02,800
-嗯   -我知道

1141
01:36:02,820 --> 01:36:05,040

你感覺還好嗎？
You feeling okay?

1147
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:36,590
我們晚餐時想你了
We missed you at dinner.

1148
01:36:37,530 --> 01:36:40,130
我沒事 剛度過了艱難的一天
I'm okay. Just had a rough day.

1149
01:36:44,930 --> 01:36:47,710
我早上要飛出去看莫莫
I'm flying out to see Momo in the Morning.

1150
01:36:47,740 --> 01:36:49,140
我會盡快回來的
I'll be back as soon as I can.

1151
01:36:51,570 --> 01:36:52,810
她是不是...
Abs, is she...

1152
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:58,480
她這次能挺過去嗎？
Is she gonna pull through this time?

1153
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:04,020
我不知道
I don't know.

1154
01:37:05,690 --> 01:37:06,790
我希望能挺過去
I hope so.

1155
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,390
告訴她我愛她
Tell her I love her.

1156
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:54,820
繼續睡吧 公主
Keep sleeping, princess.

1157
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:11,750
你個笨蛋
You rubes.

1158
01:40:11,770 --> 01:40:15,150
一輩子都在做小盒子
Spend your whole lives making little boxes,

1159
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:17,990
小小的回憶

1160
01:40:18,010 --> 01:40:21,090
哦  你覺得他們讓你這麼富有
Oh, you think they make you so rich.

1161

噢 我的腦海裏是一座大教堂

她要多少錢？我不知道！
- How much does she... - I don't know!

1189
01:42:39,450 --> 01:42:42,000
我不知道...有個問題
- I don't know... - There's a problem.

1190
01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:43,000
現在不行！
Not now!

1191
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:44,090
格蘭帕·弗利克...
Grampa Flick...

1192
01:42:45,130 --> 01:42:46,890
我想他在騎自行車
I think he's cycling.

1193
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:55,180
丹叔叔！ 丹叔叔  我傷著她了
Uncle Dan! Uncle Dan, I hurt her.

1194
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:56,210
我真的傷著她了

1195
01:42:56,240 --> 01:42:57,980
我傷著她  她活該
I hurt her and she deserved it

1196
01:42:58,010 --> 01:43:00,080
這不是最好的部分 最好的部分是...
and that's not the best part. The best part is...

1197
01:43:00,110 --> 01:43:03,190
最好的是我在她腦子裏 我進入了她的腦海
The best part is I got in her head. I got in her head.

1198
01:43:03,210 --> 01:43:05,320
-丹叔？你在嗎？  -天啊 阿布拉
- Uncle Dan? Are you there? - Oh, God, Abra.

你能聽到我說話嗎？
Can you hear me?

1200
01:43:06,550 --> 01:43:07,950
你都做了什麼？
What have you done?

1201
01:43:24,030 --> 01:43:26,580
去和孩子談談
Just talk to the kid.

1202
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:29,100
如果我們要這麼做 那我們就這麼做
If we're gonna do this, then let's do this.

1203
01:43:32,410 --> 01:43:33,510
嗨 阿布拉
Hi, Abra.

1204

我不明白
I don't understand.

1206
01:43:45,250 --> 01:43:46,350
你會的
You will.

1207
01:43:48,220 --> 01:43:51,200
我以為我們能長生不死
I thought we lived forever.

1208
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:53,940
有人承諾過你嗎 安迪？
Did someone promise you that, Andi?

1209
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:56,260
有人說你是不朽的嗎？
Did someone say you're immortal?

1210
01:43:57,430 --> 01:44:02,380
我說 「長壽 吃得好 」
I said, "Live long, eat well."

1211
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:04,380
我們可以活得很長 很長
We can live long, very long.

1212
01:44:04,410 --> 01:44:05,520
我們有

1214
01:44:07,340 --> 01:44:09,310
但我們一直吃得不好
But we haven't been eating well.

No, you're not.

1221
01:44:31,270 --> 01:44:36,350
你看著帝國興衰
You watched empires rise and fall.

1222
01:44:36,370 --> 01:44:39,150
為羅馬的角鬥士歡呼
Cheered the gladiators in Rome.

1223
01:44:39,170 --> 01:44:41,190
在大洋彼岸航行
Sailed across oceans,

1224
01:44:41,210 --> 01:44:43,420
到新的世界
to new worlds,

1225
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:49,560
當你養活國王、王子和教皇的時候
while you fed on kings, and princes, and popes.

1226
01:44:49,580 --> 01:44:52,260
他們寫了你的神話
They wrote myths of you,

1227
01:44:52,290 --> 01:44:54,600
並製作了雕像
and made statues,

1228
01:44:54,620 --> 01:44:59,440
他們在自己的村莊和床上發抖
and they trembled in their villages, and beds,

1229
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:01,630
還有摩天大樓
and skyscrapers.

1230
01:45:03,230 --> 01:45:05,640

你是個國王...
You're a king...

1233
01:45:13,110 --> 01:45:15,310
你吃了恐懼
and you eat fear.

1234
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:08,570
嘿  兄弟
Hey, bro.

You know, it's 4:00 a.m.

你一直都看到我  比利
You've always seen me, Billy.

1237
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,570
你對人很有判斷力  這樣說公平嗎？
You have a good sense about people, is that fair to say?

1238
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:16,710
是啊 什麼...
Yeah, what...

1239
01:46:16,740 --> 01:46:18,980
你覺得我是個誠實的人？一個好人？
You think I'm an honest man? A good man?

1240
01:46:19,010 --> 01:46:20,280
是的 我知道 丹 我...

1241

我需要你的幫助
I need your help.

1242
01:46:22,110 --> 01:46:23,650
我需要的第一件事就是  讓你聽一個故事
The first thing I need is for you to listen to a story

1243
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:26,380
並且比以前更努力地相信我
and try harder than you've ever tried to believe me.

1244
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:44,570
進展得怎樣？
How's it going?

1245
01:46:45,770 --> 01:46:47,240
哦 嘿
Oh, hey.

1246
01:46:47,270 --> 01:46:48,510
你不應該準備上學嗎？
Shouldn't you be getting ready for school?

1247
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:51,350
是的 但我想一起去
Yeah, but I wanted to tag along.

1248
01:46:51,370 --> 01:46:52,620
你開車多久了？
How long have you been driving?

1249
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:54,380
幾個小時左右..
A few hours or so.

1250
01:46:54,410 --> 01:46:56,140
我們今晚應該到那裏 一會
We should get there tonight. Late.

1251
01:46:58,580 --> 01:47:00,320
他是誰？
Who's that?

1252
01:47:00,350 --> 01:47:01,680
他是我的朋友
He's my friend.

1253
01:47:02,650 --> 01:47:04,290
也許是我最好的朋友
Maybe my best friend.

1254
01:47:05,650 --> 01:47:07,630
你應該看看她的臉
You should've seen her face.

1255
01:47:07,660 --> 01:47:09,700
她很害怕  丹叔
She was scared, Uncle Dan.

1256
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:11,600
像那些孩子一樣害怕
Scared like all those kids were scared.

1257
01:47:11,630 --> 01:47:13,400
她殺的那些孩子
All those kids she's killed.

1258
01:47:13,430 --> 01:47:16,510
她太生氣了 太害怕了 我進去了
She was so mad and so scared that I got in.

1259
01:47:16,530 --> 01:47:18,110
這是一個新的把戲
That was a new trick.

1260
01:47:18,130 --> 01:47:19,640
我以前從沒這麼做過
I've never done that before.

1261
01:47:19,670 --> 01:47:21,600
是啊 我也是 是什麼感覺？
Yeah, me neither. What was it like?

1262
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:24,050
就像圖書館
Like a library.

1263
01:47:24,070 --> 01:47:26,310
我想我們都是裏面的圖書
I guess we're all libraries inside.

1264
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:28,690
你怎麼做到的？
How'd you do it?

1265
01:47:28,710 --> 01:47:31,090
像這樣 只是稍微推一下
Like this. Just a little push.

1266
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:37,730
阿布拉！
Abra!

1267
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:39,590
對不起！對不起 對不起 對不起！
Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry!

1268
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:46,200
-對不起  我不是故意的  -沒關係
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. - It's okay.

1269
01:47:47,660 --> 01:47:49,610
那些箱子都是什麼？
What were all those boxes?

1270
01:47:49,630 --> 01:47:50,740
什麼都沒有
Nothing.

1271
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:52,130
撒謊
Liar.

1272
01:47:55,240 --> 01:47:57,510
我小時候
When I was a kid,

1273
01:47:57,540 --> 01:48:00,620
我比你年輕的時候  遇到了類似的事情
younger than you, I bumped into something like these things

1274
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:03,490
就像他們吃的那樣
that ate like they do.

1275
01:48:03,510 --> 01:48:05,710
但那不是一個人  而是一個地方
Only it wasn't a person, it was a place.

1276
01:48:07,350 --> 01:48:12,160
他們把它關起來 讓它腐爛
They closed it down after and let it rot.

1277
01:48:12,190 --> 01:48:14,390
但是生活在那裏的東西 他們...
But the things that lived there, they...

1278
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:18,500
別再到那兒來找我了
Don't go poking around in there again.

1279
01:48:18,530 --> 01:48:21,200
好吧 我不會的 我保證
Okay, I won't. I promise.

1280
01:48:34,510 --> 01:48:36,790
我們差不多準備好了 我們只是在裝貨
We're almost ready. We're just loading up.

1281
01:48:36,810 --> 01:48:38,250
好
Good.

1282
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:39,560
把商隊弄到路上
Get the caravan on the road

1283
01:48:39,580 --> 01:48:41,160
我們一兩天就能見到她
and we'll have her in a day or two.

1284
01:48:41,180 --> 01:48:43,630
我覺得你不該來  羅西
I don't think you should come, Rosie.

1285
01:48:43,650 --> 01:48:46,600
你剛才他媽的說什麼？
The fuck did you just say?

1286
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:47,800
她給你貼了標籤
She tagged you.

1287
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:49,300
她進入了你的大腦
She got in your head.

1288
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:51,200
是啊 不會再發生了
Yeah, it won't happen again.

1289
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:53,140
誰知道在你把她趕出去之前  她還瞭解多少
And who knows how much she got to before you kicked her out.

1290
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:54,470
她是我的 克魯 噢
She's mine, Crow.

1291
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:55,810
據我們所知 現在
Right now, as far as we know,

1292
01:48:55,830 --> 01:48:58,340
你是她唯一能追蹤的人
you are the only one of us she could track.

1293
01:48:58,370 --> 01:49:00,380
如果她看到你來
Now, if she sees you coming,

1294
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:01,680
她可以跑
she could run

1295
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:03,640
或者設置另一個陷阱
or set another Trap.

1296
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:07,580
我要把她打昏
I will knock her out cold.

1297
01:49:07,610 --> 01:49:10,690
國安局的一名線人給了我有用的信息
One of our assets from the NSA gave me the good stuff.

1298
01:49:10,710 --> 01:49:13,890
把她趕出去  別讓她吸毒過量
Put her out without chance of an overdose.

1299
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:16,690
我往南走  繞一圈
I'll head south. I'll circle around.

1300
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:18,630
我會從另一個方向來找她
I'll come at her from a different direction.

1301
01:49:18,650 --> 01:49:19,860
我應該在那裏
I should be There.

1302
01:49:19,890 --> 01:49:21,820
你知道我是對的
You know I'm right about this.

1303
01:49:26,290 --> 01:49:27,460
好吧
Okay.

1304
01:49:29,330 --> 01:49:31,410
如果你願意 我會把安迪留在這裏
I'll leave Andi here with you, if you want.

1305
01:49:31,430 --> 01:49:34,180
不 不 你們都需要力量
No, no, you'll need your strength, all of you.

1306
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:36,180
如果她耍了你
If she pulls a trick on you,

1307
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:38,250
就同歸於盡
stay together.

1308
01:49:38,270 --> 01:49:39,220
-嗯  -嗯
- Yeah? - Mm-Hmm.

1309
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:40,580
嗯
Mm-Hmm.

1310
01:49:40,610 --> 01:49:42,680
但我有自己的把戲
But I got some tricks of my own.

1311
01:49:48,620 --> 01:49:50,420
嘿 我想我們來了
Hey, I think we're here.

1312
01:49:52,850 --> 01:49:53,850
好吧
Okay.

1313
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:57,160
我去看看能不能找到她
I'll see if I can get her.

1314
01:49:58,390 --> 01:49:59,390
阿布拉？
Abra?

1315
01:50:01,260 --> 01:50:03,970
這就是標誌 往後拉
That's the sign. Pull around back.

1316
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,580
她說把車開回去
She says to pull around back.

1317
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:06,710
我會告訴你什麼時候停下來
And I'll tell you when to Stop.

1318
01:50:06,730 --> 01:50:08,500
她會告訴我們什麼時候停下來
She'll tell us when to Stop.

1319
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:16,850
我要告訴你 丹諾
I gotta tell you, Danno,

1320
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:19,520
我不知道我希望你是對的還是錯的
I don't know whether I hope you're right or wrong about this.

1321
01:50:19,550 --> 01:50:23,230
我是說 如果你錯了 我的朋友就瘋了
I mean, if you're wrong, my friend is crazy.

1322
01:50:23,250 --> 01:50:27,000
我是說 全面的精神崩潰
I mean, full-blown, mental breakdown,

1323
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:30,770
虛構的-怪物-殺戮-想像的-孩子
imaginary-monsters- killing-imaginary-kids

1324
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:32,500
癮君子
bonkers.

1325
01:50:32,530 --> 01:50:34,900
但是你知道我...我可以用這個
But, you know, I... I can work with that.

1326
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:37,540
如果你是對的...
If you're right, though...

1327
01:50:37,560 --> 01:50:39,280
我知道
I know.

1328
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:40,700
更糟糕了
It's much worse.

1329
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:56,460
你應該回家
You should go home.

1330
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:58,290
什麼？
What?

1331
01:50:58,320 --> 01:50:59,620
不  不是你
No, not you.

1332
01:51:00,690 --> 01:51:01,930
我能搞定
I can handle it.

1333
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:04,630
不是  我們會從這裏拿走的
No. We'll take it from here.

1334
01:51:07,700 --> 01:51:09,530
好吧 只有我們倆
Okay, it's just us.

1335
01:51:26,510 --> 01:51:27,750
你聞到了嗎？
You smell that?

1336
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:33,030
以前是打獵的 我告訴過你嗎？
Used to hunt. I ever tell you that?

1337
01:51:33,050 --> 01:51:34,460
不
No.

1338
01:51:34,490 --> 01:51:35,490
鹿
Deer.

1339
01:51:35,990 --> 01:51:37,460
在這個夏天
This one summer,

1340
01:51:38,590 --> 01:51:40,500
我夾住了這只雄鹿
I clipped this buck.

1341
01:51:40,530 --> 01:51:42,870
我追蹤了兩天
I was tracking it for two days.

1342
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:46,310
我打中了  夾住了他
I got the shot, clipped him.

1343
01:51:46,330 --> 01:51:48,580
他掙脫了  我去追
He ran off, I went after.

1344
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:51,980
我以為他堅持不了多久
Figured he wasn't gonna last long.

1345
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:55,490
然後他消失了
Then he vanished.

1346
01:51:55,510 --> 01:51:58,560
剛剛升起來蒸發了
Just up and evaporated.

1347
01:51:58,580 --> 01:52:01,020
一點痕跡也沒有  真是莫名其妙
Not a trace. Truly baffling.

1348
01:52:03,980 --> 01:52:05,490
五天後
Five days later,

1349
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:08,460
我在嘗試一個不同的地方 幾英里外
I'm trying a different spot, miles away.

1350
01:52:08,490 --> 01:52:11,590
我到處找盲點痕跡的地方
I come around looking for a spot for a blind...

1351
01:52:13,530 --> 01:52:14,800
然後我聞到了他的味道
then I smelled him.

1352
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:17,700
聞著他的味道
Smelled him.

1353
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:20,680
找到那只雄鹿
Found that buck

1354
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:22,940
窩在一個空心的樹幹上
holed up to a hollow trunk,

1355
01:52:23,770 --> 01:52:25,470
已經死了好幾天了
dead for days.

1356
01:52:26,810 --> 01:52:28,380
有股味道...
The smell...

1357
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:31,510
從那以後再也沒去打過獵
Never hunted a day since.

1358
01:52:34,980 --> 01:52:36,950
這次是同樣的味道
This is the same smell.

1359
01:52:52,870 --> 01:52:54,370
比利
Billy.

1360
01:53:13,850 --> 01:53:15,060
哦 天哪！
Oh, my God!

1361
01:53:48,090 --> 01:53:49,130
他媽的
Fuck.

1362
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:51,700
他媽的 丹諾 他媽的怎麼回事？
Fuck, Danno. What the fuck?

1363
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:54,470
他們甚至沒有把他埋得很深  他們埋的很淺
They didn't even bury him deep. They buried him shallow.

1364
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:55,500
抱歉  比利
I'm sorry, Billy.

1365
01:53:57,130 --> 01:53:58,800
你讓我們陷入了什麼？
What did you get us into?

1366
01:54:07,210 --> 01:54:08,780
做這件事的人...
The people who did that...

1367
01:54:08,810 --> 01:54:09,940
他們不是人
They're not people.

1368
01:54:11,210 --> 01:54:14,060
不是 不 他們不是
No. No, they ain't.

1369
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:15,820
任何人對一個小男孩那樣做
Anyone do that to a little boy,

1370
01:54:17,150 --> 01:54:19,500
他們不是人
they ain't people.

1371
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,730
你找到了嗎？
Did you get it?

1372
01:54:20,750 --> 01:54:21,870
是的 我們找到了
Yeah, we got it.

1373
01:54:21,890 --> 01:54:23,730
她回來了嗎？
Is she back?

1374
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:25,670
我們要回到你身邊  我們早上就回來
We're heading back to you. We'll be back in the Morning.

1375
01:54:25,690 --> 01:54:26,790
我們得停下來
We got a stop to make.

1376
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:31,670
我要你告訴你父母發生了什麼
I need you to show your parents what's happening.

1377
01:54:32,170 --> 01:54:33,880
不行
No.

1378
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:36,210
-不行  他們認為我很正常
- No. They almost think I'm normal.

1379
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:37,850
如果我告訴他們 他們會...
If I tell them, they'll...

1380
01:54:37,870 --> 01:54:39,550
羅斯會通過他們找到你的
Rose'll go through them to get to you.

1381
01:54:39,570 --> 01:54:40,980
你知道的 不是嗎？
You know that, don't you?

1382
01:54:41,010 --> 01:54:42,820
她會不假思索的殺掉他們
She'll cut them down without a second thought.

1383
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:44,650
她來了 阿布拉
And she's coming, Abra.

1384
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:47,010
他們需要知道
They need to know.

1385
01:54:51,750 --> 01:54:54,000
所以 我們要做什麼？
So, what's this stop we gotta make?

1386
01:54:54,020 --> 01:54:56,160
你還有那些舊的獵鹿槍嗎？
You still got those old deer rifles?

1387
01:55:13,770 --> 01:55:15,580
你是丹叔叔嗎？
You're Uncle Dan?

1388
01:55:15,610 --> 01:55:16,950
-你他媽的以為你是？-先生...
- The fuck you think you are? - Sir...

1389
01:55:16,980 --> 01:55:18,950
嗯？嗯？她已經13歲了！！
Hmm? Hmm? She is 13 years old!

1390
01:55:18,980 --> 01:55:20,290
阿布拉 我讓你給他看的
Abra, I told you to show him.

1391
01:55:20,310 --> 01:55:22,090
-我告訴他了 -嗯 那不一樣
- I told him. - Well, that's not the same.

1392
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:23,530
在我報警之前  我要揍你一頓 嗯？
I'm gonna kick your ass before I call the police, huh?

1393
01:55:23,550 --> 01:55:24,690
-嘿 嘿 嘿！-不 不 不阿布拉
- Hey, hey, hey! - No, no, no. Abra.

1394
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:25,860
現在 別說她的名字
Now, don't you say her name.

1395
01:55:25,890 --> 01:55:26,920
阿布拉...
Abra...

1396
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:45,080
對不起 斯通先生 我是朋友
I'm sorry, Mr. Stone. I am a friend.

1397
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:47,580
她告訴你的一切都是真的
Everything she told you is true.

1398
01:55:50,340 --> 01:55:52,090
到底發生了什麼？
What the hell is happening?

1399
01:55:52,110 --> 01:55:53,890
對不起
I'm Sorry.

1400
01:55:53,910 --> 01:55:56,260
阿布拉需要給你看點東西

1401
01:55:56,280 --> 01:55:57,690
我看到那個男孩了
I saw the boy.

1402
01:55:57,720 --> 01:55:58,720
我看到了他的屍體
I saw his body.

1403
01:55:59,350 --> 01:56:00,900
一切都是真的
It's all true.

1404
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:02,520
可能 你的朋友把他放在那兒了

1405
01:56:03,620 --> 01:56:05,300
你想過嗎？
You think about that?

1406
01:56:05,330 --> 01:56:06,770
不會很久的 我沒有
Not for long, I didn't.

1407
01:56:06,790 --> 01:56:09,110
斯通先生 你女兒很特別
Mr. Stone, your daughter is special.

1408
01:56:09,130 --> 01:56:10,340
不要談論她
Don't talk about her.

1409
01:56:10,360 --> 01:56:12,670
我想你知道 在內心深處

1410
01:56:14,230 --> 01:56:16,980
她知道那個小男孩出了什麼事
She knows what happened to that little boy,

1411
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,810
她知道是誰幹的
and she knows who did it.

1412
01:56:19,810 --> 01:56:20,880
給他看
Show him.

1413
01:56:25,250 --> 01:56:26,760
對不起 爸爸
I'm sorry, Daddy.

1414
01:56:26,780 --> 01:56:29,030
我真的不想
I really didn't want to.

1415
01:56:29,050 --> 01:56:30,160
不想什麼？
Didn't want to What?

1416
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:49,810
不了 謝謝
No, thanks.

1417
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:51,180

1418
01:57:00,110 --> 01:57:01,350
那些人...
Those people...

1419
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:05,030
他們知道我女兒的事嗎？
they know about my daughter?

1420
01:57:05,050 --> 01:57:06,760
是的
They do.

1421
01:57:06,790 --> 01:57:09,230
他們遲早會來的
And sooner or later, they're coming.

1422
01:57:09,260 --> 01:57:10,870
我們得做點什麼
We gotta do something.

1423
01:57:10,890 --> 01:57:12,940
好吧  我們要報警  聯邦調查局...
All right, we're calling the police, the FBI...

1424
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:15,670
這些人已經存在很久了 長官
These people have been around a long, long time, sir.

1425
01:57:15,700 --> 01:57:17,210
他們很有錢 很有關係
They're rich, connected.

1426
01:57:17,230 --> 01:57:19,780
我不認為他們會擔心警察
I don't think they're worried about the police.

1427
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:21,240
但他們在哪裏？
But where are they?

1428
01:57:21,270 --> 01:57:23,710
他們什麼時候來？我們能去哪裏？
When are they coming? Where can we go?

1429
01:57:23,740 --> 01:57:25,750
阿布拉可以回答...
Abra can answer that...

1430
01:57:25,770 --> 01:57:27,080
她準備好了
if She's ready.

1431
01:57:28,240 --> 01:57:29,310
我準備好了
I'm ready.

1432
01:57:39,290 --> 01:57:41,300
你真的想這麼做嗎？
You sure you wanna do this?

1433
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:42,790
我不得不這麼做
I have to.

1434
01:58:25,030 --> 01:58:26,810
95號州際公路
I-95.

1435
01:58:26,830 --> 01:58:29,210
巴裏 烏鴉 蛇和其他一些人
Barry, the Crow, the Snake, and a few others.

1436
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:31,110
樹的變化不大
The trees haven't changed that much,

1437
01:58:31,140 --> 01:58:33,480
所以也許是馬薩諸塞州
so maybe Massachusetts,

1438
01:58:33,510 --> 01:58:35,420
-但他們很接近 -羅斯？
- but they're close. - Rose?

1439
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:37,320
沒看到她
Didn't see her.

1440
01:58:37,340 --> 01:58:38,880
但他們來了
But they're coming.

1441
01:58:42,780 --> 01:58:45,160
這是她唯一看到的房間？？
This is the only room she saw?

1442
01:58:45,180 --> 01:58:46,500
是的
That's right.

1443
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:49,900
我做了一些改變 藏了些東西
And I made a few changes. Hid a few things.

1444
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:51,940
好吧
All Right.

1445
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:54,200
嗯 他們會試圖追蹤你
Well, they'll be trying to track you,

1446
01:58:54,230 --> 01:58:56,030
試圖趕上
trying to catch on.

1447
01:58:57,900 --> 01:58:59,200
你就讓他們這麼做
And you're gonna let them.

1448
01:59:00,770 --> 01:59:02,080
你瘋了嗎？
Are you crazy?

1449
01:59:02,100 --> 01:59:04,350
可能吧  但你就讓他們這麼做
Possibly, but you're gonna let them.

1450
01:59:04,370 --> 01:59:06,870
然後我需要你試著做這個小把戲
And then I need you to try and do a little trick.

1451
01:59:07,910 --> 01:59:09,210
一個魔術？
A magic trick?

1452
01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:19,130
他們在跟蹤我們
They're following us.

1453
01:59:19,150 --> 01:59:22,000
集中精力 你得堅持到他們找到這兒
Concentrate. You gotta keep it up until they land.

1454
01:59:22,020 --> 01:59:23,020
我知道
I know.

1455
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:56,270
這應該行得通
This should work.

1456
01:59:56,290 --> 01:59:58,830
好的百葉窗在那邊  還有那裏
Good blinds over there, and There.

1457
02:00:02,130 --> 02:00:03,240
他們還在附近？
They still close?

1458
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:04,370
我想 越來越近了
Getting closer, I think.

1459
02:00:05,260 --> 02:00:06,410
這很艱難
This is tough.

1460
02:00:06,430 --> 02:00:08,940
我知道 我知道 不會太久了
I know. I know. Not much longer.

1461
02:00:12,540 --> 02:00:14,140
好吧 烏鴉爸爸
Okay, Crow Daddy,

1462
02:00:15,140 --> 02:00:16,440

go get her.

1463
02:01:03,390 --> 02:01:06,070
你看起來很放鬆
You look relaxed.

1464
02:01:06,090 --> 02:01:08,500
你感覺很放鬆  是吧  阿巴拉
You feel relaxed, don't you, Abra?

1465
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:10,970
我想是吧
I guess.

1466
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:12,130
你應該
You should.

1467
02:01:12,930 --> 02:01:14,580
別緊張
Just relax.

1468
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:16,250
我們是朋友
We're friends.

1469
02:01:16,270 --> 02:01:18,010
你們是朋友
You're friends.

1470
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:19,170
是的
That's right.

1471
02:01:20,210 --> 02:01:22,320

Just friends.

1472

好朋友
Good friends.

1474
02:01:32,620 --> 02:01:34,130
哦 媽的
Well, shit.

1475
02:01:34,150 --> 02:01:35,630
就像他們告訴你的那樣
The way they talked you up,

1476
02:01:35,660 --> 02:01:37,670
我在想會不會更難一點
I was thinking it'd be a little harder than that.

1477
02:01:42,460 --> 02:01:44,210
他媽的？
The fuck?

1478
02:01:44,230 --> 02:01:46,480
把戲  只不過是他媽的惡作劇罷了
Parlor tricks. Just fuckin' parlor tricks.

1479
02:01:51,070 --> 02:01:52,450

02:04:41,170 --> 02:04:42,680

我沒看到烏鴉 烏鴉在哪裏？
I didn't see the Crow. Where is the Crow?

1504
02:05:06,130 --> 02:05:07,400
你好 阿布拉
Hello, Abra.

1505
02:05:13,610 --> 02:05:15,210

Abra!

1506
02:05:18,810 --> 02:05:20,580
離她遠點
Get away from her.

1507
02:05:23,720 --> 02:05:24,720
後退

02:05:27,720 --> 02:05:29,390
當然 爸爸

02:05:31,220 --> 02:05:33,200
很高興見到你
You know, I'm glad I got to meet you.

1510
02:05:33,230 --> 02:05:35,840
我他媽的會殺了你  後退
I'll fucking kill you. Step back.

1511
02:05:35,860 --> 02:05:37,710
一些勇敢的詞兒
Some brave words.

1512
02:05:37,730 --> 02:05:41,270
看著你們這些鄉巴佬威脅上帝  我總是覺得很好笑
Always tickles me, watching you rubes threaten a god.

1513
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:44,550
你知道 你的小女兒
You know, your little girl,

1514
02:05:44,570 --> 02:05:48,180
她也許是我們最好的食物
she's maybe the best food we'll ever have.

1515
02:05:48,210 --> 02:05:51,380
我很高興我有機會讚美廚師
I'm so glad I had a chance to compliment the chef.

1516
02:06:29,550 --> 02:06:31,320
很好 你醒了
Oh, good, you're awake.

1517
02:06:41,730 --> 02:06:42,870
丹...
Dan...

1518
02:06:42,900 --> 02:06:44,370
別費心了
Don't bother.

1519
02:06:51,570 --> 02:06:53,520
我怎麼了？
What's wrong with me?

1520
02:06:53,540 --> 02:06:55,620
你吃過藥了 小姐
You've been dosed, missy.

1521
02:06:55,640 --> 02:06:58,390
比我以前用過的都多
More than I've ever used before.

1522
02:06:58,410 --> 02:07:00,720
可能會讓你在這裏或者那裏醒來
Might let you wake up here and there,

1523
02:07:00,750 --> 02:07:03,220
但你的蒸汽很快  睡吧
but that steam of yours is fast aSleep.

1524
02:07:06,490 --> 02:07:07,690
我的爸爸
My dad...

1525
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:10,770
我爸怎麼了？
What happened to my dad?

1526
02:07:10,790 --> 02:07:12,560
今天很多好人被殺了
Lot of good people killed today.

1527
02:07:13,530 --> 02:07:14,930
很多好人
Lot of good people.

1528
02:07:16,630 --> 02:07:18,940
我很想告訴你有人會付出代價
I'd love to tell you someone will pay,

1529
02:07:18,970 --> 02:07:23,910
在今天的悲慘事件  中出現了某種正義感
some kind of justice raining down on the sad events today,

1530
02:07:23,940 --> 02:07:26,450
但它不是那樣運作的
but it don't work like that.

1531
02:07:26,470 --> 02:07:28,240
我們會一直擁有你的
We were always gonna have you.

1532
02:07:29,510 --> 02:07:31,820
我的一些人死了
Some of my people are dead.

1533
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:33,510
你的有些人死了
Some of yours are dead.

1534
02:07:34,610 --> 02:07:37,590
但結果並沒有改變
Outcome didn't change, though.

1535
02:07:37,620 --> 02:07:38,890
仔細想想
Think on that a minute.

1536
02:07:39,950 --> 02:07:41,550
結果沒有改變
The outcome didn't change.

1537
02:07:42,460 --> 02:07:43,720
所以  他們的死
So, their deaths,

1538
02:07:44,720 --> 02:07:46,570
所有的人
all of them,

1539
02:07:46,590 --> 02:07:48,870
只是一種浪費
just a waste.

1540
02:07:48,890 --> 02:07:50,310
你帶來的浪費
A waste you brought on

1541
02:07:50,330 --> 02:07:52,410
敬我們大家  小姐
to us all, young lady.

1542
02:07:52,430 --> 02:07:53,580
為了什麼？
For What?

1543
02:07:55,470 --> 02:07:57,350
聽我說...
Please hear me...

1544
02:07:57,370 --> 02:08:00,280
沒人聽到你說話
Ain't nobody hearing you.

1545
02:08:00,310 --> 02:08:02,680
不妨冷靜一下 好好享受這段旅程
Might as well calm down and enjoy the ride.

1546
02:08:03,710 --> 02:08:05,990
就像我說的
Like I said,

1547
02:08:06,010 --> 02:08:08,280
結果沒有改變
outcome hasn't changed.

1548
02:08:28,570 --> 02:08:29,770
不
No.

1549
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:32,950

02:09:16,780 --> 02:09:18,990

Okay. Okay.

1558
02:09:19,020 --> 02:09:20,560
好吧
Okay, Okay.

1559
02:09:20,590 --> 02:09:23,000
好吧 你總是說...
Okay, you always said...

1560
02:09:23,020 --> 02:09:24,800
你的大腦就像收音機
your brain was like a radio.

1561
02:09:24,820 --> 02:09:27,640
你打電話的時候沒人接 所以別打了
No one's answering when you call, so stop calling.

1562
02:09:27,660 --> 02:09:29,060
聽著
And just listen.

1563
02:09:46,810 --> 02:09:49,160

幫幫我
Help.

1565
02:10:04,660 --> 02:10:05,780
嘿
Hi.

1566
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:06,870
丹
Dan.

1567
02:10:10,070 --> 02:10:11,440
他給你下藥了嗎？
Did he drug you?

1568
02:10:12,810 --> 02:10:13,970
我很抱歉
I'm so Sorry.

1569
02:10:15,740 --> 02:10:17,690
我想試試看 好嗎？
I'm gonna try something, okay?

1570
02:10:17,710 --> 02:10:18,690
但你很虛弱
But you're weak.

1571
02:10:18,710 --> 02:10:20,560
他在阻止你
He's blocking you.

1572
02:10:20,580 --> 02:10:22,730
我幾乎聽不見你說話
I could barely hear you.

1573
02:10:22,750 --> 02:10:24,420
你要相信我 好嗎？
You gotta trust me, okay?

1574
02:10:26,050 --> 02:10:27,520
好嗎？
Okay?

1575
02:10:41,470 --> 02:10:43,880
又醒了 是吧？
Awake again, huh?

1576
02:10:43,900 --> 02:10:47,070
可能得在下次休息的時候給你下藥
Might have to dose you at the next rest Stop.

1577
02:10:49,140 --> 02:10:50,640
我們要去哪裏？
Where are we going?

1578
02:10:51,610 --> 02:10:52,850
嗯 你知道在哪
Mm, you know where.

1579
02:10:53,910 --> 02:10:55,980
他媽的 我感覺宿醉
Fuck, I feel hungover.

1580
02:10:58,850 --> 02:11:01,530
我告訴過你這是好東西
I told you it's good shit.

1581
02:11:01,550 --> 02:11:04,670
好多年沒宿醉了 你知道 我不會錯過的
Haven't felt hungover in years. And, you know, I don't miss it.

1582
02:11:04,690 --> 02:11:05,890
一點也沒有
Not even a little.

1583
02:11:08,030 --> 02:11:09,840
西部 哈？
West, huh?

1584
02:11:09,860 --> 02:11:12,770
遠離大路  很聰明
Stayin' off the major roads. Smart.

1585
02:11:14,830 --> 02:11:17,570
克朗維爾  紐約
Crownville. New York.

1586
02:11:20,740 --> 02:11:22,990
你是誰
Who are you?

1587
02:11:23,010 --> 02:11:24,810
我是殺了你朋友的人
I'm the guy that killed your friends.

1588
02:11:30,780 --> 02:11:32,150
很高興見到你
It's nice to meet you.

1589
02:11:34,020 --> 02:11:35,660
不錯的詭計
Neat trick.

1590
02:11:35,690 --> 02:11:37,630
以前沒見過這個
Haven't seen this one before.

1591
02:11:37,660 --> 02:11:39,230
想再看一個嗎？
Wanna see one more?

1592
02:11:42,660 --> 02:11:46,130
不要以為羅斯會高興  如果你對獎品開槍
Don't imagine Rose'll be too happy if you shoot the prize.

1593
02:11:48,870 --> 02:11:52,280
我想羅斯不會為這件事高興的
I don't suppose Rose will be happy about any of this.

1594
02:11:52,300 --> 02:11:55,050
當那個女人生氣的時候...
And when that woman gets mad...

1595
02:11:55,070 --> 02:11:57,690
嗯 在我看來你知道的夠多了
Well, it seems to me you know enough

1596
02:11:57,710 --> 02:12:00,590
你可能想置身事外
to know you might wanna sit this one out.

1597
02:12:00,610 --> 02:12:02,060
算是你的福氣吧
Count your blessings.

1598
02:12:02,080 --> 02:12:03,930
你走吧
Go on your way.

1599
02:12:06,090 --> 02:12:07,760
有什麼好笑的 朋友？
What's so funny, friend?

1600
02:12:07,790 --> 02:12:11,770
好吧 這只是傲慢 這是傲慢 真的
Well, it's just arrogance. It's arrogance, really.

1601
02:12:11,790 --> 02:12:15,170
但這是有道理的 如果你認為你會永生
But it makes sense, if you think you're gonna live forever.

1602
02:12:15,190 --> 02:12:19,570
有道理  你當然不會系安全帶
Stands to reason, of course you wouldn't wear your seatbelt.

1603
02:12:29,140 --> 02:12:32,250
不！
No!

1604
02:12:42,790 --> 02:12:43,960
丹？
Dan?

1605
02:12:45,590 --> 02:12:46,870
丹？
Dan?

1606
02:13:18,160 --> 02:13:19,730
我希望這很痛
I hope that hurts.

1607
02:13:20,290 --> 02:13:21,630
羅西
Rosie...

1608
02:13:22,660 --> 02:13:23,710
很疼
A lot.

1609
02:14:11,710 --> 02:14:13,750
你個小婊子
You little bitch.

1610
02:14:15,850 --> 02:14:17,920
你做了什麼？
What have you done?

1611
02:14:29,300 --> 02:14:31,060
好吧 婊子養的
All right, bitch child.

1612
02:14:32,100 --> 02:14:33,100
好吧
All Right.

1613
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:42,840
對不起
Sorry.

1614
02:15:42,870 --> 02:15:44,010
打瞌睡了
Dozed off.

1615
02:15:44,040 --> 02:15:45,740
不  你應該休息
No, you earned it.

1616
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:50,280
我們在哪？
Where are we?

1617
02:15:50,310 --> 02:15:51,780
俄亥俄州
Ohio.

1618
02:15:52,310 --> 02:15:53,420
我們要去哪裏？
Where are we going?

1619
02:15:53,450 --> 02:15:54,450
科羅拉多
Colorado.

1620
02:15:56,150 --> 02:15:57,720
為什麼科羅拉多？
Why Colorado?

1621
02:16:00,220 --> 02:16:01,990
她會再來的
She's gonna keep coming.

1622
02:16:03,120 --> 02:16:04,720
-我知道 -永無休止
- I know. - Always.

1623
02:16:06,090 --> 02:16:07,470
如果我們結束了這一切
This only ends if we end it,

1624
02:16:07,490 --> 02:16:09,940
我不認為我們能打敗她
and I don't think we can beat her.

1625
02:16:09,960 --> 02:16:11,400
不是我們自己
Not by ourselves.

1626
02:16:13,570 --> 02:16:15,210
有個地方
There's a place.

1627
02:16:15,230 --> 02:16:18,050
對我們這樣的人來說很危險的地方
A place that's dangerous for people like us.

1628
02:16:18,070 --> 02:16:21,220
你告訴我的那個地方？飢餓的地方？
The place you told me about? The hungry place?

1629
02:16:21,240 --> 02:16:22,880
是的  沒錯
Yeah, That's right.

1630
02:16:22,910 --> 02:16:25,790
如果這麼危險 我們為什麼要去那裏？
If it's so dangerous, why would we go there?

1631
02:16:25,810 --> 02:16:28,190
如果對我們這樣的人來說很危險
Well, if it's dangerous for people like us,

1632
02:16:28,210 --> 02:16:31,130
我想對像她這樣的人 也是很危險的
I expect it's dangerous for people like her.

1633
02:16:31,150 --> 02:16:32,890
也許更是嚴重
Maybe even more so.

1634
02:16:33,950 --> 02:16:34,950
好的
Good.

1635
02:16:36,020 --> 02:16:37,790
她在跟蹤我們  你知道的
She's following us, you know.

1636
02:16:38,890 --> 02:16:40,790
是的  很好  讓她這麼做吧
Yeah, good. Let her.

1637
02:16:48,400 --> 02:16:50,100
你父親的事我很抱歉
I'm sorry about your father.

1638
02:16:52,870 --> 02:16:54,340
很抱歉你的朋友
Sorry about your friend.

1639
02:17:17,160 --> 02:17:19,580
是我媽媽
It's my mom.

1640
02:17:19,600 --> 02:17:20,930
我該對她說什麼？
What do I say to her?

1641
02:17:25,600 --> 02:17:26,550
嗨 媽媽
Hi, Mom.

1642
02:17:26,570 --> 02:17:27,920
噢 感謝上帝！
Oh, thank God!

1643
02:17:27,940 --> 02:17:29,080
阿布拉...
Abra...

1644
02:17:29,110 --> 02:17:30,810
你還好嗎？ 你在哪？
Are you okay? Where are you?

1645
02:17:31,640 --> 02:17:33,050
我愛你
I love you.

1646
02:17:36,080 --> 02:17:38,430
當我們安全後  你打電話給她  告訴她在哪裏能找到我們
When we're safe, you'll call her and tell her where to find us?

1647
02:17:38,450 --> 02:17:39,600
我會的
I will.

1648
02:17:39,620 --> 02:17:41,020
好吧
Okay.

1649
02:18:14,650 --> 02:18:17,060
不會太遠了  上山
Not too much further. Up the mountain.

1650
02:19:52,620 --> 02:19:54,400
我們要做的就是
Here's what we're gonna do.

1651
02:19:54,420 --> 02:19:57,260
你要呆在車裏  讓暖氣開著
You're gonna stay in the car, keep the heater running.

1652
02:19:57,290 --> 02:20:00,470
我不想你在裏面呆一分鐘 如果你不需要的話
I don't want you spending a minute inside there if you don't have to.

1653
02:20:00,490 --> 02:20:02,240
她只能從這裏來..
She can only come from here.

1654
02:20:02,260 --> 02:20:03,770
你很容易就能看到她
You can see her a mile out, easy.

1655
02:20:03,800 --> 02:20:06,140
你看到那邊山上的燈光
You see lights on the mountain over there,

1656
02:20:06,160 --> 02:20:07,710
對我放衝擊波  好嗎？
you blast me, Okay?

1657
02:20:07,730 --> 02:20:11,180
但我不想讓你進去  在她來之前
But I don't want you going in. Not until she's here.

1658
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:13,680
你不是在等我嗎？
You aren't waiting with me?

1659
02:20:13,710 --> 02:20:14,650
我做不到
I can't.

1660
02:20:14,670 --> 02:20:15,670
為什麼不呢？
Why not?

1661
02:20:16,640 --> 02:20:18,240
我得把它弄醒
I have to wake it up.

1662
02:21:20,240 --> 02:21:21,470
醒來  醒來
Wakey-wakey.

1663
02:26:01,020 --> 02:26:02,930
晚安  托倫斯先生
Slow night, Mr. Torrance.

1664
02:26:02,960 --> 02:26:04,820
不會太久的  我想
Not for long, I imagine.

1665
02:26:06,630 --> 02:26:08,640
你是個威士忌的人 不是嗎？
You're a whiskey man, are you not?

1666
02:26:08,660 --> 02:26:10,760
我是  大部分時間都是
I was, most of the time.

1667
02:26:18,440 --> 02:26:19,840
在房子裏
On the house.

1668
02:26:23,610 --> 02:26:25,750
這是你的牌子
This was your brand.

1669
02:26:25,780 --> 02:26:27,590
傑克·丹尼爾的
Jack Daniel's.

1670
02:26:27,610 --> 02:26:29,990
我以前在家裏看過瓶子
I used to see the bottles in our home.

1671
02:26:30,010 --> 02:26:33,530
我們真正的家 在這一切之前
Our real home, before all this.

1672
02:26:33,550 --> 02:26:36,720
我聞過一次 聞起來好像著火了
I smelled one once. It smelled like something on fire,

1673
02:26:37,890 --> 02:26:40,570
我想是的
which I suppose it was.

1674
02:26:40,590 --> 02:26:43,100
恐怕你把我和別人搞混了
I'm afraid you've confused me with someone else.

1675
02:26:43,130 --> 02:26:44,660
我是勞埃德
It's Lloyd.

1676
02:26:45,160 --> 02:26:46,570
勞埃德
Lloyd.

1677
02:26:47,900 --> 02:26:50,040
抱歉 托倫斯先生
I apologize, Mr. Torrance.

1678
02:26:50,070 --> 02:26:53,980
我不知道每個人都在哪兒  但它會回來的
I don't know where everyone is, but it'll pick up.

1679
02:26:54,010 --> 02:26:55,880
噢 我知道他們在哪
Oh, I know where they are.

1680
02:26:55,910 --> 02:26:57,010
你說得對...
And you're right...

1681
02:26:57,880 --> 02:26:59,050
它會回來的
it'll pick up.

1682
02:27:01,210 --> 02:27:04,020
如果你不介意的話 托倫斯先生 你看起來...
If you don't mind my saying, Mr. Torrance, you seem...

1683
02:27:05,650 --> 02:27:06,790
被利用
put upon.

1684
02:27:07,790 --> 02:27:09,630
被利用？
Put upon?

1685
02:27:09,650 --> 02:27:10,920
不是這樣的
Ain't that the way.

1686
02:27:11,920 --> 02:27:13,870
人們只是過著自己的生活
Man just living his life,

1687
02:27:13,890 --> 02:27:15,970
試著做他的工作
trying to do his work.

1688
02:27:15,990 --> 02:27:18,070
他被利用
He gets put upon.

1689
02:27:18,100 --> 02:27:19,840
捲入了別人的問題..
Pulled into other people's problems.

1690
02:27:19,870 --> 02:27:22,700
如果你不介意的話  我經常看到它
I see it all the time, if you don't mind my saying.

1691
02:27:25,670 --> 02:27:27,670
所以我們住在佛羅里達
So we lived in Florida.

1692
02:27:28,710 --> 02:27:29,720
不好意思？
I'm sorry?

1693
02:27:29,740 --> 02:27:31,790
媽媽和我
Mom and I.

1694
02:27:31,810 --> 02:27:34,080
恐怕我不知道你的意思是誰
I'm afraid I don't know who you mean.

1695
02:27:36,620 --> 02:27:39,590
我們再也不想看到雪了
We never wanted to see snow again,

1696
02:27:39,620 --> 02:27:41,800
所以我們住在佛羅里達
So we lived in Florida.

1697
02:27:41,820 --> 02:27:45,070
很小的地方 但很舒服 我們很開心
Tiny place, but it was comfortable, and we were happy.

1698
02:27:45,090 --> 02:27:46,990
我是說 我們很傷心
I mean, we were grieving.

1699
02:27:49,760 --> 02:27:51,710
我們受到了創傷
We were traumatized,

1700
02:27:51,730 --> 02:27:53,500
但也有幸福
but there was happiness too.

1701
02:27:56,700 --> 02:27:57,700
她...
She...

1702
02:27:59,200 --> 02:28:01,480
她會把目光移開
She would look away.

1703
02:28:01,510 --> 02:28:04,910
她會看著我  但她總是在一兩秒鐘後移開視線
She'd look at me, but she'd always look away after a second or two.

1704
02:28:06,180 --> 02:28:08,020
我花了一段時間才注意到這一點
It took me a while to notice it.

1705
02:28:08,050 --> 02:28:10,490
但是在看完之後  她不會看我的眼睛
But after the Overlook, she wouldn't look me in the eyes,

1706
02:28:10,520 --> 02:28:12,230
不會太久
not for long.

1707
02:28:12,250 --> 02:28:13,850
我搞不懂
Couldn't figure it out.

1708
02:28:16,290 --> 02:28:17,290
但它...
But it...

1709
02:28:21,160 --> 02:28:22,530
是你
It was you.

1710
02:28:24,860 --> 02:28:28,530
她在我身上看到了你的眼睛 她不得不把目光移開
She saw your eyes in me, and she'd have to look away.

1711
02:28:29,900 --> 02:28:31,750
她不得不這麼做 這讓她很痛苦
It tortured her to have to do that.

1712
02:28:31,770 --> 02:28:33,650
所以 我修補它
So, I fixed it.

1713
02:28:33,670 --> 02:28:36,680
我幫她修復這一點  這是我最後一次用它了
I fixed it for her, and it was the last time I ever used it.

1714
02:28:36,710 --> 02:28:39,750
好讓她看著我的時候不再見到你
So that she wouldn't see you anymore when she looked at me.

1715
02:28:42,810 --> 02:28:45,090
她死的時候我才20歲
I was 20 when she died.

1716
02:28:45,120 --> 02:28:48,960
當時 我看到有人要死了
And back then, I saw when someone was gonna die.

1717
02:28:48,990 --> 02:28:51,170
我看到蒼蠅了 黑色的蒼蠅
I saw flies. Black flies.

1718
02:28:51,190 --> 02:28:55,040
「死蒼蠅」 我叫他們 圍著人們的臉轉
"Death flies," I called them, circling people's faces.

1719
02:28:55,060 --> 02:28:57,910
在過去的幾周裏 她被...
And in those last weeks, she was covered...

1720
02:28:57,930 --> 02:28:59,770
她的整個臉
Her whole face.

1721
02:28:59,800 --> 02:29:02,910
我幾乎看不見她的眼睛
I could barely see her eYes.

1722
02:29:02,930 --> 02:29:07,850
我也...我試圖安慰她 但我幾乎看不見她
And I... I tried to comfort her, but I could hardly look at her.

1723
02:29:07,870 --> 02:29:09,770
她看到了
And she saw that.

1724
02:29:12,110 --> 02:29:14,190
她就躺在那兒等死
She just lay there dying,

1725
02:29:14,210 --> 02:29:16,120
她的兒子看不見她
with her son who couldn't look at her.

1726
02:29:22,150 --> 02:29:25,830
也許一些溫暖的東西可以消除這些不愉快
Maybe something warm to push away such unpleasantries.

1727
02:29:25,860 --> 02:29:28,900
你不想聽聽嗎？她是你的妻子
Don't you wanna hear about it? She was your wife.

1728
02:29:28,930 --> 02:29:32,040
我覺得你把我當成了別人
I think you've mistaken me for someone else.

1729
02:29:32,060 --> 02:29:35,340
-我只是個酒保  -哦 是嗎？
- I'm just a bartender. - Oh, yeah?

1730
02:29:35,370 --> 02:29:38,610
只有勞埃德酒保 在俯瞰酒店傾倒喜悅
Just Lloyd the bartender, pouring joy at the Overlook Hotel.

1731
02:29:38,640 --> 02:29:41,210
我給你倒任何你喜歡的東西 托倫斯先生
I'll pour whatever you like, Mr. Torrance.

1732
02:29:42,810 --> 02:29:43,940
哦 爸爸
Oh, Dad.

1733
02:29:45,880 --> 02:29:48,090
這種飲料要花很多錢
This drink will cost an awful lot.

1734
02:29:48,110 --> 02:29:50,120
你的錢在這裏不好用
Your money is no good here.

1735
02:29:50,150 --> 02:29:51,990
房子裏的規定
Orders from the house.

1736
02:29:52,020 --> 02:29:53,960
比錢還要貴
It'll cost more than money.

1737
02:29:53,990 --> 02:29:56,330
我要花八年時間
It'll cost me eight years.

1738
02:29:56,350 --> 02:29:58,870
八個人在我後面 誰知道前面有多少人
Eight behind me, and who knows how many in front of me.

1739
02:29:58,890 --> 02:30:01,330
你的信用很好 托倫斯先生
Your credit is fine, Mr. Torrance.

1740
02:30:08,800 --> 02:30:10,670
男人喝一杯
Man takes a drink,

1741
02:30:11,770 --> 02:30:13,070
這飲料需要喝一杯
the drink takes a drink,

1742
02:30:14,240 --> 02:30:16,070
然後這杯酒帶走了一個人
and then the drink takes a man.

1743
02:30:17,140 --> 02:30:18,840
不是嗎 爸爸？
Ain't it so, Dad?

1744
02:30:22,980 --> 02:30:24,280
醫藥
Medicine.

1745
02:30:25,980 --> 02:30:27,850
醫藥就是它的本質
Medicine is what It is.

1746
02:30:28,850 --> 02:30:31,100
善意的治療方法
Bona fide cure-all.

1747
02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:35,960
抑鬱 壓力 悔恨 失敗 把一切都抹去
Depression, stress, remorse, failure, wipes it all away.

1748
02:30:37,730 --> 02:30:39,800
心靈是一塊黑板..
The mind is a blackboard.

1749
02:30:40,260 --> 02:30:41,600
以及這個
And this

1750
02:30:42,300 --> 02:30:43,800
是橡皮擦
is the eraser.

1751
02:30:49,070 --> 02:30:51,180
一個人嘗試
A man tries.

1752
02:30:51,210 --> 02:30:52,340
他提供了
He provides.

1753
02:30:53,740 --> 02:30:55,920
但他被嘴巴包圍了
But he's surrounded by mouths.

1754
02:30:55,950 --> 02:30:59,060
吃 尖叫 哭泣 嘮叨
that eat, and scream, and cry, and nag.

1755
02:30:59,080 --> 02:31:02,700
所以 他要求一件事 只是給他一件事
So, he asks for one thing, just one thing for him.

1756
02:31:02,720 --> 02:31:04,230
把他暖和起來...
To warm him up...

1757
02:31:04,260 --> 02:31:07,300
從那些日子的嘴裏取出毒刺
to take the sting out of those days of the mouths,

1758
02:31:07,320 --> 02:31:10,070
吃 吃 吃 吃他做的一切
eating, and eating, and eating everything he makes,

1759
02:31:10,090 --> 02:31:12,670
他所擁有的一切
everything he has.

1760
02:31:12,700 --> 02:31:14,240
以及一個家庭
And a family.

1761
02:31:14,270 --> 02:31:16,370
一個妻子 一個孩子
A wife, a kid.

1762
02:31:17,900 --> 02:31:20,250
那些嘴吃時間
Those mouths eat time.

1763
02:31:20,270 --> 02:31:21,870
他們吃了你在地球上的日子
They eat your days on Earth.

1764
02:31:23,270 --> 02:31:24,880
他們只是狼吞虎嚥
They just gobble them up.

1765
02:31:26,340 --> 02:31:28,750
這足以使一個人生病
It's enough to make a man sick.

1766
02:31:29,720 --> 02:31:30,780
以及這個...
And this...

1767
02:31:32,120 --> 02:31:34,020
是醫藥
is the Medicine.

1768
02:31:36,150 --> 02:31:39,100
告訴我 小狗
So, tell me, pup,

1769
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:41,760
你要吃藥嗎？
are you gonna take your medicine?

1770
02:31:44,800 --> 02:31:46,370
我不是
I'm not.

1771
02:31:48,400 --> 02:31:49,740
哦
Oh.

1772
02:31:49,770 --> 02:31:51,110
你看 我很抱歉
Look at that. I'm Sorry.

1773
02:31:51,140 --> 02:31:54,110
我老糊塗了 托倫斯先生 原諒我
Clumsy old me, Mr. Torrance. Forgive me.

1774
02:31:55,740 --> 02:31:57,110
把你清理一下
Let's get you cleaned up.

1775
02:32:15,430 --> 02:32:17,410
管理層感到擔心
Management is concerned.

1776
02:32:17,430 --> 02:32:18,800
擔心嗎？
Concerned?

1777
02:32:21,170 --> 02:32:23,750
她對你做的事太可怕了
It's horrible what she's done to you.

1778
02:32:23,770 --> 02:32:25,440
把你弄得一團糟
Pulled you into her mess.

1779
02:32:27,940 --> 02:32:29,310
一個聰明人？
A smart man?

1780
02:32:30,340 --> 02:32:33,350
他會讓她來處理的
He'd let her handle it.

1781
02:32:33,380 --> 02:32:36,890
順其自然吧
Let things unfold as they're meant to.

1782
02:32:36,910 --> 02:32:39,290
你為什麼要為她付出  醫生？
Why should you pay her tab, Doc?

1783
02:32:41,020 --> 02:32:43,060
為了什麼？
And For What?

1784
02:32:43,090 --> 02:32:46,930
為了這個  惹了這麼多麻煩的小女孩？
For this little girl who started all this trouble?

1785
02:32:46,960 --> 02:32:49,500
管理層會讓我做些什麼？
What would management have me do about that?

1786
02:32:50,160 --> 02:32:52,310
什麼都沒有
Nothing.

1787
02:32:52,330 --> 02:32:55,240
世上最容易做的事 孩子
Easiest thing in the world to do, son.

1788
02:32:55,270 --> 02:32:57,440
把她帶進去
Just bring her inside.

1789
02:32:57,470 --> 02:32:59,950
然後 嗯
And then, well,

1790
02:32:59,970 --> 02:33:03,070
接受你不能改變的事情
you accept the things you cannot change.

1791
02:33:04,240 --> 02:33:05,390
丹！
Dan!

1792
02:33:05,410 --> 02:33:06,450
她來了
She's here.

1793
02:33:24,460 --> 02:33:25,930
好吧
Okay.

1794
02:33:40,380 --> 02:33:43,090
這個地方病了
This place is sick.

1795
02:33:43,110 --> 02:33:45,460
就像我媽媽生病一樣
Sick like my momo was sick.

1796
02:33:45,480 --> 02:33:47,090
是癌癥
It's cancer,

1797
02:33:47,120 --> 02:33:49,400
只會更糟
only worse.

1798
02:33:56,630 --> 02:33:58,210
我們現在做什麼？
What do we do now?

1799
02:33:58,230 --> 02:34:00,270
我們進去 她會找到我們的
We head inside. She'll find us.

1800
02:35:50,240 --> 02:35:52,950
好 好 好
Well, well, well.

1801
02:35:54,450 --> 02:35:56,160
你好啊
Hi There.

1802
02:35:56,180 --> 02:35:59,390
開始的時候  快跑
When this starts, run.

1803
02:35:59,420 --> 02:36:02,260
是的 你跑吧 親愛的
Yes, you run, dear.

1804
02:36:02,290 --> 02:36:04,630
然後我會找到你
And then I will find you

1805
02:36:04,660 --> 02:36:08,530
你會尖叫很多年  直到你死
and you will scream for years until you die.

1806
02:36:10,590 --> 02:36:13,240
我們會看到誰在尖叫
We'll see who does the screaming.

1807
02:36:13,260 --> 02:36:15,040
噢 我們會看到的
Oh, we'll see indeed.

1808
02:36:15,070 --> 02:36:17,040
她是對的 你知道的
She's right, you know.

1809
02:36:17,070 --> 02:36:18,540
你應該害怕
You should be afraid.

1810
02:36:19,700 --> 02:36:22,120
為什麼？
Why is that?

1811
02:36:22,140 --> 02:36:24,720
因為你不知道你站在哪裏
Because you don't know where you're standing.

1812
02:36:24,740 --> 02:36:26,980
對不起 你是誰 帥哥？
I'm sorry, who are you, handsome?

1813
02:36:31,280 --> 02:36:34,490
是你殺了我的烏鴉  不是嗎？
You're the one who killed my Crow, aren't you?

1814
02:36:36,120 --> 02:36:37,120
走
Go.

1815
02:37:38,320 --> 02:37:40,590
很聰明
Clever.

1816
02:37:40,620 --> 02:37:42,450
你做了一些改進 不是嗎？
You've made some improvements, haven't you?

1817
02:37:44,120 --> 02:37:46,630
從上次我在你腦海裏
Since the last time I was in your mind.

1818
02:37:46,660 --> 02:37:48,460
你怎麼知道我們不在你家？
How do you know we're not in yours?

1819
02:38:03,240 --> 02:38:04,380
你在哪裏 小狗？
Where are you, pup?

1820
02:38:25,260 --> 02:38:26,730
你會死在這裏
You're gonna die here.

1821
02:38:27,700 --> 02:38:30,880
嗯  詞兒很勇敢  親愛的
Mm. Brave words, dear.

1822
02:38:30,900 --> 02:38:32,570
你真的這麼想嗎？
Is that what you really think?

1823
02:38:33,340 --> 02:38:36,120
你要傷害我？
You're gonna hurt me?

1824
02:38:36,140 --> 02:38:37,380
是的
Yes.

1825
02:38:43,720 --> 02:38:46,820
你讓我想起了我自己
You know, you remind me of myself.

1826
02:38:48,550 --> 02:38:51,130
我現在真的看到了
I can really see it now.

1827
02:38:51,160 --> 02:38:53,530
你內心深處有黑暗 親愛的
You've got a darkness in you, dear.

1828
02:38:53,560 --> 02:38:57,100
我想你和我唯一的區別就是時間
I think the only difference between you and me is time.

1829
02:39:06,570 --> 02:39:08,170
你還不知道...
You don't know yet...

1830
02:39:08,840 --> 02:39:10,240
你要做什麼...
what you'd do...

1831
02:39:11,180 --> 02:39:13,820
更多的時間
for more time.

1832
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:17,350
但我向你保證 親愛的 哦 你會很驚訝的
But I promise you, dear, oh, you'd be surprised.

1833
02:39:22,790 --> 02:39:24,690
疼痛能淨化蒸汽
Pain purifies steam.

1834
02:39:25,790 --> 02:39:29,660
害怕也是  所以  你明白
Fear, too, so, you understand.

1835
02:39:49,510 --> 02:39:52,290
我年輕的時候和你一樣
I was just like you when I was younger.

1836
02:39:52,320 --> 02:39:53,680
我很特別
I was special

1837
02:39:54,650 --> 02:39:56,700
隻身一人
and alone.

1838
02:39:56,720 --> 02:39:59,370
但我遇到了一個人  他給了我目標  社區的禮物
But I met someone who gave me the gift of purpose, of community.

1839
02:39:59,390 --> 02:40:01,400
我也許會給你這樣的禮物
And I might have given you such a gift

1840
02:40:01,430 --> 02:40:04,330
如果事情有不同的發展
if things would have gone differently.

1841
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,280
不是嗎？
No?

1842
02:40:09,300 --> 02:40:11,210
挑釁  不是嗎
Defiant, aren't you?

1843
02:40:12,340 --> 02:40:13,750
很像我
So much like me.

1844
02:40:13,770 --> 02:40:16,770
你想的是
Your mind is So...

1845
02:40:19,380 --> 02:40:21,380
這不是你的想法  對吧？
This isn't your mind, is it?

1846
02:40:23,950 --> 02:40:25,680
這根本不是你
This isn't you at all.

1847
02:40:27,920 --> 02:40:30,250
你只是誘餌
You're just the bait.

1848
02:40:33,730 --> 02:40:34,730
夠了！
Enough!

1849
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:39,500
跑
Run.

1850
02:40:41,700 --> 02:40:43,840
我們怎麼會想你？
How the hell did we miss you?

1851
02:40:45,740 --> 02:40:46,980
哦...
Oh...

1852
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,570
你和我幾年前就該認識了
You and I should have met years aGo.

1853
02:40:53,040 --> 02:40:54,310
丹尼
Danny.

1854
02:40:55,380 --> 02:40:59,290
這是你的名字 不是嗎？
That's your name, isn't it?

1855
02:40:59,320 --> 02:41:02,800
嗯 當你的皮膚變老時 蒸汽會發生一些事情
Well, something happens to the steam when you rubes get older.

1856
02:41:02,820 --> 02:41:04,960
它被污染了
It gets polluted.

1857
02:41:04,990 --> 02:41:06,700
很髒
Dirty.

1858
02:41:06,720 --> 02:41:07,730
你知道的
You know that.

1859
02:41:08,990 --> 02:41:11,770
我看到你全身都是油脂
I see the grease all over you.

1860
02:41:11,800 --> 02:41:14,770
你的光芒不大一樣
You don't shine quite the same.

1861
02:41:14,800 --> 02:41:17,340
我想  長大後會毀了這一切
Growing up spoils that, I guess.

1862
02:41:19,640 --> 02:41:21,580
我說真的 帥哥
Seriously, handsome,

1863
02:41:21,610 --> 02:41:24,310
你一直躲在哪裏？
where have you been hiding?

1864
02:41:27,310 --> 02:41:29,010
我可以給你一個提議
I can make you an offer.

1865
02:41:30,510 --> 02:41:32,360
我很少提出這個提議
An offer I rarely make.

1866
02:41:32,380 --> 02:41:34,830
噢 是嗎？我等不及了
Oh, yeah? I can't wait.

1867
02:41:34,850 --> 02:41:36,760
如此有天賦的男孩
Such a gifted boy

1868
02:41:36,790 --> 02:41:40,630
把他的光隱藏了這麼久
hiding his light under a bushel for so long.

1869
02:41:40,660 --> 02:41:45,040
你可以活很久 很久 活得也很好
You could live a long, long time. Live well, too.

1870
02:41:45,060 --> 02:41:49,610
放縱自己 不會有任何後果
Indulge yourself, no consequences,

1871
02:41:49,630 --> 02:41:51,270
沒有宿醉
no hangovers.

1872
02:41:52,870 --> 02:41:55,550
吃得好 活得久..
Eat well, live long.

1873
02:41:55,570 --> 02:41:58,550
你一定很孤獨 是最後一個
You must be lonely, being the last one.

1874
02:41:58,580 --> 02:42:00,720
我是說 世界上最後一個
I mean, the last one in the world.

1875
02:42:00,740 --> 02:42:03,380
寶貝 我不是最後一個 遠非如此
Sweetie, I'm not the last. Far from it.

1876
02:42:04,620 --> 02:42:06,460
我是最漂亮的
I'm just the prettiest.

1877
02:42:06,480 --> 02:42:08,520
我想你知道我的答案
I assume you know my answer.

1878
02:42:10,020 --> 02:42:11,360
可憐
Pity.

1879
02:42:11,390 --> 02:42:12,890
所以 我們到底要不要這麼做？
So, are we doing this or not?

1880
02:42:29,670 --> 02:42:31,450
咻
Whew.

1881
02:42:33,640 --> 02:42:35,590
哦 甜心
Oh, sweetie.

1882
02:42:35,610 --> 02:42:38,380
哦 看看這個 嗯？
Oh, look at that, huh?

1883
02:42:39,580 --> 02:42:43,830
我好像割斷了你的股動脈
I seem to have nicked your femoral artery There.

1884
02:42:43,850 --> 02:42:45,890
為什麼 你會流血致死 是吧？
Why, you're gonna bleed to death, huh?

1885
02:42:52,030 --> 02:42:54,480
天哪  天哪  你真有脾氣
My, my, what a temper you have.

1886
02:42:54,500 --> 02:42:56,010
太火了
So much fire.

1887
02:42:56,030 --> 02:42:57,810
太浪費了！
Such a waste!

1888
02:42:57,830 --> 02:42:59,480
或者不是
Or maybe not.

1889
02:43:06,610 --> 02:43:08,860
噢  該死
Oh, damn.

1890
02:43:08,880 --> 02:43:11,430
即使在你這個年紀...
Even at your age...

1891
02:43:11,450 --> 02:43:12,950
太好了
it's so Good.

1892
02:43:18,160 --> 02:43:19,990
你嘗起來像威士忌
You taste like whiskey.

1893
02:43:25,600 --> 02:43:26,700
丹尼！
Danny!

1894
02:43:27,730 --> 02:43:29,000
丹尼小子！
Danny boy!

1895
02:43:30,500 --> 02:43:32,610
哦 太恐怖了
Oh, so much terror.

1896
02:43:32,640 --> 02:43:34,510
一輩子 嗯？
All your life, huh?

1897
02:43:36,940 --> 02:43:38,540
美味
Delicious.

1898
02:43:44,720 --> 02:43:46,650
別傷害我！
Don't hurt me!

1899
02:43:48,620 --> 02:43:49,620
噢  該死
Oh, damn.

1900
02:43:53,960 --> 02:43:55,640
什麼......你在哪兒並不孤單
What are... You're not alone in There.

1901
02:43:55,660 --> 02:43:57,870
啊？
Huh?

1902
02:43:57,900 --> 02:43:59,130
你在隱藏什麼
What are you hiding, Huh?

1903
02:44:01,630 --> 02:44:03,140
裏面有什麼？
What's in those?

1904
02:44:03,170 --> 02:44:04,710
有什麼特殊的東西
Something special, Huh?

1905
02:44:04,740 --> 02:44:08,540
他們不特別  他們很餓
They're not special. They're starving.

1906
02:44:17,010 --> 02:44:18,690
不
No.

1907
02:44:18,720 --> 02:44:19,990
不！
No!

1908
02:44:57,560 --> 02:44:59,570
丹尼
Hello, Danny.

1909
02:45:01,590 --> 02:45:03,130
過來和我們一起玩...
Come and play with us...

1910
02:45:04,930 --> 02:45:06,840
永遠...
forever...

1911
02:45:06,860 --> 02:45:09,030
...永遠...
...and ever...

1912
02:45:10,570 --> 02:45:11,970
永遠
and ever.

1913
02:45:46,600 --> 02:45:47,870
丹叔叔
Uncle Dan.

1914
02:45:48,910 --> 02:45:50,780
丹叔  完成了嗎？
Uncle Dan, is it done?

1915
02:45:50,810 --> 02:45:52,910
她死了嗎？
Is she dead?

1916
02:46:14,900 --> 02:46:17,240
很棒的派對  不是嗎？
Great party, isn't it?

1917
02:46:17,270 --> 02:46:18,640
阿布拉！
Abra!

1918
02:46:22,370 --> 02:46:23,610
阿布拉！
Abra!

1919
02:46:40,160 --> 02:46:41,590
阿布拉！
Abra!

1920
02:46:47,900 --> 02:46:49,630
阿布拉！
Abra!

1921
02:47:07,950 --> 02:47:09,120
試試看
Try it.

1922
02:47:12,020 --> 02:47:13,800
哦  你在這兒
Oh, There you are.

1923
02:47:13,820 --> 02:47:14,890
阿布拉
Abra.

1924
02:47:16,090 --> 02:47:18,840
你一直非常非常糟糕
You've been very, very bad.

1925
02:47:18,860 --> 02:47:21,010
你不是丹叔叔
You're not Uncle Dan.

1926
02:47:21,030 --> 02:47:23,900
你是個面具 一張假臉
You're a mask. A false face.

1927
02:47:25,300 --> 02:47:26,810
我還會是誰？
Who else would I be?

1928
02:47:26,840 --> 02:47:28,650
你就是酒店
You're the hotel.

1929
02:47:28,670 --> 02:47:29,850
但他還在裏面
But he's still in There.

1930
02:47:29,870 --> 02:47:31,340
所以面具就沒了
Mask is off, then.

1931
02:47:36,150 --> 02:47:38,190
你為什麼笑？
Why are you smiling?

1932
02:47:38,220 --> 02:47:40,760
因為你不知道你站在哪裏
Because you don't know where you're standing.

1933
02:47:40,790 --> 02:47:44,670
我知道這些大廳就像我自己的臉 孩子
I know these halls like my own face, child.

1934
02:47:44,690 --> 02:47:46,800
我是說你站在裏面的屍體
I mean the body you're standing in.

1935
02:47:46,820 --> 02:47:48,770
你戴的那張臉
The face you're wearing.

1936
02:47:48,790 --> 02:47:50,670
那是丹·托倫斯 你不認識他
That's Dan Torrance, and you don't know him.

1937
02:47:50,700 --> 02:47:52,310
丹·托倫斯
Dan Torrance.

1938
02:47:52,330 --> 02:47:56,070
丹·托倫斯一到這裏就停了下來
Dan Torrance made one stop as soon as he got here.

1939
02:47:57,130 --> 02:47:58,770
到鍋爐房..
To the boiler room.

1940
02:48:23,360 --> 02:48:25,800
你回來了
There you are.

1941
02:48:27,130 --> 02:48:28,740
你應該跑的
You were supposed to Run.

1942
02:48:28,770 --> 02:48:30,440
我不想離開你
I didn't wanna leave you.

1943
02:48:33,370 --> 02:48:35,240
我就在我該去的地方
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.

1944
02:48:37,170 --> 02:48:39,920
我再也受不了了 阿布拉 你得快跑
I can't hold it off for much longer. Abra, you need to Run.

1945
02:48:39,940 --> 02:48:41,190
不
No.

1946
02:48:41,210 --> 02:48:42,820
沒有你我哪兒也去不了
I'm not going anywhere without you.

1947
02:48:42,850 --> 02:48:45,180
我得把門關上 對吧？
I have to close the door behind us, right?

1948
02:48:46,220 --> 02:48:47,890
跑啊！ 跑啊！
Run! Run!

1949
02:51:02,250 --> 02:51:03,900
快點  丹叔叔
Come on, Uncle Dan.

1950
02:51:03,920 --> 02:51:05,060
離開那裏
Get out of There.

1951
02:51:06,490 --> 02:51:07,590
快點
Come on.

1952
02:51:19,340 --> 02:51:21,610
火勢蔓延得很快
The fire spread fast,

1953
02:51:21,640 --> 02:51:23,620
摧毀了酒店
destroying the hotel.

1954
02:51:23,640 --> 02:51:25,210
淨化了它
Purifying it.

1955
02:51:26,640 --> 02:51:28,660
我幾乎能聽到...
I could almost hear it...

1956
02:51:28,680 --> 02:51:29,680
尖叫
screaming.

1957
02:51:31,180 --> 02:51:33,930
我能聽到它快死了
I could hear it dying.

1958
02:51:33,950 --> 02:51:36,490
在內心深處 我知道...
And deep inside, I knew...

1959
02:51:39,360 --> 02:51:40,990
我就知道你沒事
I knew you were Okay.

1960
02:51:42,560 --> 02:51:44,430
很抱歉我把你置於危險之中
I'm sorry I put you in danger.

1961
02:51:45,600 --> 02:51:47,000
這是唯一的辦法
It was the only way.

1962
02:51:48,070 --> 02:51:49,300
我知道
I know.

1963
02:51:50,400 --> 02:51:53,550
你覺得她是對的嗎
Do you think she was right

1964
02:51:53,570 --> 02:51:55,610
她說她不是最後一個？
when she said she wasn't the last one?

1965
02:51:56,970 --> 02:51:58,380
世界是個飢餓的地方
The World's a hungry place.

1966
