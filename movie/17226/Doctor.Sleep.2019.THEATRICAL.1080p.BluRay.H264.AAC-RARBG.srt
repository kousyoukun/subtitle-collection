such a funny hat. [chuckles]

You said they were just pictures
in a book and they couldn't hurt me.

The Overlook,

95
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,995
it was always just pictures to me.

96
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,960
But I didn't shine like you.

97
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,229
Nobody shines like you.

98
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,756
So, you in that damn hotel,
you was like a million-watt battery

And it ate it up.

World's a hungry place.

102
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,714
And the darkest things are the
hungriest, and they'll eat what shines.

104

Can't do nothing about that.

105
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,192
What you can do...

106
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,835
is turn what they come for against ‘em.

107
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,154
My grandfather,

108
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,273
he was a mean son of a bitch.

109
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,759
Dark inside.

110
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,389
Same type of dark as your dad.

111
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,473
Beat me senseless,
and my grandma, too,

112
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,756
and when he died, I danced.

113
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,514
But he kept on coming back.

114

mold was growin' on him in that box.

116

So, Grandma,

117
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,909
she taught me a trick.

118
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,559
Gave me a present.

119
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,910
I want you to know this box...

120
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,557
inside and out.

121
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,155
Don't just look at it. Touch it.

122
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,072
Stick your nose inside
and see if there's a smell.

123

[young Dan] Why?

124

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,678
[grunting]

170
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,599
You're gonna take your medicine.

171
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,636
Get off him.

172
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,069
Get up. Get out of here.

173
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,193
[Deenie] Shit. I think you killed him.

174
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,960
[snorts] What if you killed him?

175
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,633
I hope you killed him. [sniffs]

176
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,393
You hear me?

177
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,914
[muffled music playing]

178
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,434
Let me kiss it better.

179
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,598
No, no, no.

180
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,155
No, no, no, no, no, no.

181
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,438
Whoa. What the... No.

182
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,840
[sighs]

183
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,072
[toddler] Mommy?

184
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,236
-Mommy? [cries]
-Baby.

185
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,550
Here, here.

186
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,349
[Dick] You can put her money back, Doc.

187
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,150
You can do that much.

188
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,277
She took mine.

189
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,670
She probably bought the coke with it.

190
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,800
[Dick] Doc.

191
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,590
[sniffs]

192
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,914
[singing on movie]
It's still the same old story

193
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,594
A fight for love and glory

194
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,113
A case of do or die

195
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,078
The world will always welcome lovers

196
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,235
As time goes by

197
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,760
[Rick] Henri wants us to finish
this bottle and then three more.

198
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,910
Andi?

199
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,115
[Rick] Says he'll water his garden
with champagne...

200
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,310
That's right.

201
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,914
[Rick] ...before he'll let
the Germans drink it.

202
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,275
[Sam] This sort of takes the sting
out of being occupied.

203
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,760
You're prettier than your picture.

204
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,752
-[Sam] Doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
-[Rick] You said it.

205
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,389
And you're older than yours.

206
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,274
[man] Are we staying here
or going somewhere?

207
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,591
Don't you wanna watch the movie?

208
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,671
[man on movie speaking German
on loudspeaker]

209
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,438
[Rose] I don't see
what the fuss is about.

210
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,715
Chat room romance.

211
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,269
Little gross. Not interesting.

212
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,313
Just watch.
It's interesting, I promise.

213
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,393
Well, it better be,
‘cause she's not all that steamy.

214
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,154
And there she goes.

215
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,391
[Andi] Aren't you tired?

216
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,398
Sleep.

217
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,395
[gasps softly]

218
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,391
Okay.

219
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,559
Wait. This is the best part.

220
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,314
I watched her do it three times now
and it never gets old.

221
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,793
[Andi] Sleep deeper,

222
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,678
deep as you can.

223
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,276
The pain you feel is only a dream.

224
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,116
You can explain a lost wallet

225
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,677
when your wife asks.

226
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,120
But you can't explain this.

227
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,635
-[snickering]
-This you'll see

228
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,992
every day when you look in the mirror.

229
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,549
And every time you see it,

230
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,513
you'll say out loud...

231
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,357
"I like little girls."

232
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,511
And the next time you go looking
for a little girl online,

233
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,198
I want you to remember that time

234
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,791
you got bitten by a rattlesnake.

235
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,597
-That is interesting.
-Mm-hmm.

236
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,270
Excuse me, miss?

237
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,034
Miss. Miss, you left something
in the theater.

238
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,235
You wanna leave me alone.

239
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,433
Well, hi there.

240
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,753
You wanna let me go.

241
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,596
Oh, no, sweetie.

242
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,789
No, I don't.

243
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,591
[Dan coughing]

244
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,115
[grunts]

245
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,789
Mommy, I made this for you.
It's a secret card.

246
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,116
[Lucy gasps] Mm, thank you, Abba-doo.

247
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,999
Does anyone know a magic word?

248
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,311
-[kids] Ooh, ooh.
-Hmm... You.

249
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,000
Abracadabra.

250
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,798
Abracadabra. That's a great one.

251
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,759
-One, two, three.
-[kids] Two, three.

252
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,072
Abracadabra.

253
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,193
I know magic, too.

254
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,629
Sometimes, if I...

255
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,074
[kids exclaim and laugh]

256
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,310
-Sorry.
-[kid jeering]

257
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,596
Has anyone seen my spoons?

258
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,319
I can do that.

259
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,470
That's nice, sweetie.

260
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,153
-[girl] They're on you!
-[magician] Oh, they're on me?

261
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,958
[David] What the hell?

262
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,432
Dave...

263
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,794
[young Abra] Abracadabra.

264
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,109

[jewelry rattles]

268
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,631
Oops.

269
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,552
Well, hi there, sleepyhead.

270
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,393
Sorry.

271
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,836
I had to sleep you pretty hard.

272
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,798
You're a tough one.

273
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,030
Willful.

274
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,754
You know, I checked.

275
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,789
Six men in three months

276
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,952
with those little snakebite tattoos
on their cheeks.

277
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,197
Why, you've been busy.

278
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,640
[Rose gasps]

279
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,474
Snakebite Andi, that's who you are.

280
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,950
So, who am I?

281
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,589
You're some crazy bitch
who kidnapped me.

282
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,793
Just the truth from now on.

283
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,270
You will only speak the truth.

284
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,878
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

285
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,394
[Rose laughs] My God.

286
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,232
Works a little too well, don't it?

287
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,634
Here's the deal, Snakebite Andi.

288
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,111
You're a pusher, hmm?
You can push people.

289
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,120
We haven't had a pusher around here
for a little while,

290
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,476
so I'm gonna offer you a deal I haven't
offered anyone in almost 40 years.

291
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,073
How old are you, darlin'?

292
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,319
Fifteen.

293
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,118
Fifteen?

294
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,920
Oh, God, what an age.

295
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,399
Springtime of your womanhood, isn't it?

296
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,679
Mm. You're not a girl anymore,

297
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,798
but you don't have
a single dent yet either.

298
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,319
Gravity hasn't even noticed you.

299
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,357
Not at 15.

300
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,994
Men, though...

301
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,839
No, no, no. No shame.

302
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,551
You paid that back, didn't you?

303
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,997
That's what I'm offering you.
Springtime forever.

304
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,596
Ten years from now, you're still 15.

305
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,229
A hundred, maybe 17.

306
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,274
Eat well,

307
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,832
stay young, live long.

308
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,510
[man] You like it?

309
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,839
Oh. Sorry. I was just...

310
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,673
That's okay.
People love to look at it.

311
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,157
We used to set this up in the library.

312
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,392
Community project,
just taking a life all its own.

313
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,597
See, we started with
the clock tower there.

314
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,591
-[Dan] Oh, yeah.
-[man] Just keeps growing.

315
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,630
Kids call it Teenytown.

316
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,154
The kids build this?

317
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,754
With some help, oh, yeah.

318
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,753
Keep it up, build the whole town square.

319
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,559
Are you off the bus
or riding your thumb?

320
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,949
Yeah, the bus.

321
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,600
Oh. Not many ride the bus
this far north.

322
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,593
Unless they're looking for work.
[sniffs]

323
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,759
Yeah.

324
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,712
Change of scenery,

325
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,355
or you running away from something?

326
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,553
Oh, don't mind me. I hope I'm...

327
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,710
New face is all.

328
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,836
Yeah.

329
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,358
Guess I'm running away from myself,
I guess.

330
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,554
Oh, yeah.

331
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,832
Running away from yourself.
That is a pickle.

332
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,200
[sighs] You take yourself with you
wherever you go.

333
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,313
-Ain't that the bitch?
-[chuckles] Mm-hmm.

334
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,589
[Mrs. Robertson] Rent's 85 a week,

335
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,989
payable up front.

336
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,431
Billy paid your first two,
rest's on you.

337
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,275
No pets, no parties, no noise.

338
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,954
-I'm a quiet tenant.
-[scoffs]

339
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,476
Last guy said the same.
Math student.

340
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,998
Even let him paint the wall
all blackboard,

341
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,993
so he could scribble
his little puzzles up there.

342
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,549
Wasn't quiet. No, sir.

343
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,157
Didn't even paint over this
when he left, but I'm glad he didn't,

344
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,630
‘cause I can make this easy for ya,

345
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,791
SO you see it every morning
when you wake.

346
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,038
You sure you wanna vouch for this pup?

347
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,315
Pretty sure.

348
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,994
It's your ass, Billy.

349
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,957
Bleedin' heart, this one.

350
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,279
I'm downstairs, ground floor,
if you need anything.

351
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,594
Find me tomorrow, talk about some work.

352
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,792
Why are you doing this?

353
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,634
You don't know me.

354
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,552
No, I don't.

355
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,109
But I know the look, like I said.

356
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,036
And sometimes I get this feeling
about people.

357
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,316
-Hard to understand, I guess.
-Mm.

358
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,912
Easier than you think.

359
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,152
-Thanks.
-All right.

360
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,910
[door closes]

361
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,634
You ready?

362
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,514
She's ready.

363
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,120
[Andi] Who... Who are these people?

364
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,952
[Rose] You'll find out after.

365
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,478
That over there is Grampa Flick...

366
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,831
and he'll lead us. Lie down.

367
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,913
There.

368
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,795
No fear.
You understand?

369
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,837
[breathing shakily]

370
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,469
We are the True Knot

371
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,631
and we endure.

What is tied cannot be untied.

378
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,874
Here is a woman.

379
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,792
Would she join us?

380
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,595
Would she tie her life to our life?

381
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,229
Yes.

382
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,512
Say yes.

383
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,119
Yes.

384
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,029
This one's special.

385
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,789
Her name's Violet.

386
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,913
There's not much of her left.

387
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,437
And she tastes...

388
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,679
like flowers.

They were used to hearing him cry

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,634
‘cause I left him alone so much.

409
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,237
So they didn't do anything.

410
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,993

You're sick.

We'll talk about it.

[AA group] God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

423
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,356
the courage
to change the things I can,

424

and the wisdom to know the difference.

[Dr. John] Well, Bobbie's got
a big birthday today.

426
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,600
Three years. Three years sober.

-[man] Yeah.
-[all applauding]

[Bobbie] Thanks, John.

429
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,598
Well, now for the most important person
in the room.

430
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,559
Is, uh, anybody here a newbie?

431
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,549
Somebody got 24 hours?

432
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,275
Yeah.

433
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,070
[Dr. John] New to town, huh?

434
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,715
[Dan stammers] Yeah, I...

435
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,837
[Dr. John] Nothing personal.
I delivered half the people in the room.

436
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,920
-Just new faces pop, that's all.
-This here is Dan Torrance.

437
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,798
-He's fresh off the bus.
-Hey.

438
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,520
Fresh off the ground, by the look.

439
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,190
Oh.

440
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,759
There's no judgment here, brother.

441
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,554
I mean, we've all been there.

442
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,558
-And worse, trust me.
-Oh, yeah.

443
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,552
If you're looking for a wing
to climb under,

444
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,879
I can't say you'll do any better
than Billy Freeman here.

445
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,629
Thank you for your hospitality. I...

446
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,238
I'm a little, uh...

447
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,957
I guess I'm not used to it.

448
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,110
[Dr. John] Well, you know we say,

449
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,470
"You can't judge someone
till you know their whole story."

450
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,909
You might think you understand,

451
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,912
-but you don't.
-You don't.

452
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,154
So, how are you today? All right?

453
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,594
[Billy] Train's still running.

454
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,592
[Dr. John] That's good to hear.

455
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,795
[Billy] You good?

456
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,917
[Dr. John] Yeah. Yeah.

457
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,509
Well, good to know you, Dan.

458
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,909
-Yeah.
-Come again.

459
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,035
-Thanks.
-Hope to see you again soon.

460
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,958
I'll... I'll come back, yeah.

461
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,394
Really good man. He's got a gift--

462
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,198
Yeah. Hey, Billy, hang on.

463
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,078
Hey, Doc.

464
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,830
Your watch. Uh...

465
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,478
You lost your watch. You were
worried about the kid with, uh...

466
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,517
Goocher's.

467
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:16,951
What?

468
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,830
The kid with Goocher's or Gaucher's.
The bone thing.

469
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,198
Gaucher's disease.

470
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,231
[Dan] Right.

471
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,158
You were washing your hands
in the hospital bathroom

472
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,078
and you left it on the soap dispenser.

473
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,390
Well, just check on the soap dispenser.

474
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,030
-It's good to meet you.
-Yeah.

475
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,679
[Dr. John] How did you know?

476
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,997
I wish I could say. Uh...

477
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,039
Lucky guess.

478
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,279
My ass.

479
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,114
Intuition, I suppose.
Like a feeling in my gut. Maybe a...

480
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,439
A lucky guess.

481
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,757
What do you wanna do here?

482
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,115
What do you mean?

483
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,398
I mean here in Frazier.
Why are you here?

484
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,237
I don't know. I don't know.

485
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,870
Something different
than I've been doing.

486
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,192
Something better.

487
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,238
You go to church?

488
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,990
Does it matter?

489
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,470
Do you believe in something?
Something...

490
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,958
bigger than you?

491
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,315
Our... Our beliefs
don't make us better people.

492
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,589
Our actions make us better people.

493
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,110
So, Billy says you have
orderly experience.

494
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,793
That's right.

495
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,280
You workin' right now?

496
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,030
A few shifts at Teenytown.
Helping with the train.

497
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,471
'Cause I do three days a week

He died when I was five,
so the only way I got to know him,

581
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,793
really got to know him,
was when I went dark.

or, uh...

584
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,996
whenever I wanted
to break someone's face,

585
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,870
‘cause the drinking
and the temper and the anger,

586
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,678
those things in me were his.

587
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,831
And they were all I could know of him.

588
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,998
But now, well, now I get to know him
a little different...

589
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,874
‘cause he also stood
in a room like this once...

wanting to get well for me and my mom.

591

all he wanted in the world

was to stand where I'm standing now.

There's less steam out there,
and it's weaker, too.

it's their cell phones or diets

00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,675

many scents these days,

are just not that--

-I know what?

It's why you're up here every day.

It's why you're always up here

836
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:57,790
for shopping with us today.

01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,152
And remember, we're always fresh,
just for you.

838
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:31,999
Well, hi there.

-No! No.

Yeah, I'm fine.

-Dan? Dan?

Get up. Stand up, Dan.

Come on, Danno.

854
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,990
-What happened?
-Well, you just dropped.

855
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,879
Thought you was having a stroke.
Who's Tony?

856
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,355
What?

857
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,079
You kept saying,
"Please help me, Tony."

858
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:34,356
Oh.

859
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,960
Well, I'm sorry about that.

[Rose sighs]

862
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,074
We've got a problem.

863
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,389
-Talk to me.
-The looker?

864
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,039
Yeah, she found me again.

865
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,233
-How?
-I don't know.

866
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,435
I don't care.

867
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:22,951
We have to have her, Crow.
We have to.

868
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,316
Does she know who you are?
Where we are?

869
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:28,717
No, I don't know. I don't think...
That's not the important... Look.

870
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,910
-I said she's huge steam, right?
-Mm-hmm.

871
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,354
Yeah, it's even bigger than that.

872
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,554
I tried to turn around in her

873
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,593
and she blew me out of her
like I was nothing.

874
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,037
-Bullshit.
-No. Never happened to me, ever.

875
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,798
I would have said that was impossible.

876
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,351
Is she food

877
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,760
or do we turn her?

878
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,153
We don't turn her.

879
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,594
Rosie, are you sure?

880
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,120
If she's what you say she is, then--

881
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:56,352
Then we don't want anyone
with that power in the Knot.

882
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,511
Jeez. Think about it.

883
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:04,954
[Lucy] Have a great day.

884
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,713

[kids chattering excitedly]

888
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,513
[Abra] Hi.

889
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,438
[Dan] Billy.

890
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,879
[Abra] You can hear me.

891
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,759
Let's use our outside voices, all right?

892
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,279
You tracked me down?

893
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:07,229
It was easier than I thought.
Like GPS, but in my head.

894
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:12,118
Look, I don't mean any offense,
but this day and age, a grown man

895
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:13,998
sitting with a teenage girl
on a park bench...

896
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,993
I'm Abra Stone.
And if anyone asks, you're my uncle.

897
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,071
Uncle Dan.

898
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,399
And that's not even a lie. Not totally.

899
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,597
You're magic, like me.

900
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:30,356
I don't know about magic.

901
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:34,078
I always called it the shining.

902
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,834
And, yeah, we both shine.

903
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,399
Do your parents know?

904
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,710
About my shine?

905
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,918
They don't talk about it.

906
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,672
Or if l use it,
they look at me different.

907
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:51,113
When I was a kid, I didn't understand
the shining. I called it "Tony."

908
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:53,596
I thought he was my imaginary friend.

909
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,229
I thought you were
my imaginary friend...

910
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,956
for a long time.

911
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:02,117
How many of us are out there?

912
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:05,597
There's a lot of people
who have a little bit of shine,

913
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,159
they don't even know it.

914
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:09,789
They always seem to come home
with flowers when their wives are sad,

915
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:12,634
or they do well on the school test
they didn't study for.

916
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:17,078
But I only met two or three people
in my whole life who knew they shined.

917
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:20,874
The baseball boy shined.

918
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:24,029
His name was Bradley Trevor.

919
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,193
These people...

920
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,031
they look like people anyway,
they took him.

921
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,871
And they ate him.

922
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,116
They ate his shine.

923
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,398
You could feel it?

924
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,513
And they could feel me.

925
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:45,714
If you could get something of his,

926
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,109
if you could go to lowa...

927
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,918
-Whoa, hang on.
-1 can help you find him.

928
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,599
Then his parents would know
where he was.

929
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,478
They could bury him right, at least.

930
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,675
We could also get his glove.

931
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,597
If I can touch that glove,
I can track them.

932
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:57,875
Easy. Easy.

933
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,839
Because Barry the Chunk,
I think that was his name,

934
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,911
for a while, before they killed him,

935
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,037
he was wearing it.

936
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:19,079
Abra, go home.

937
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,192
Don't chase these people.

938
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,277
Don't aggravate them.

939
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:26,114
And whatever you do,
don't attract their attention.

940
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,159
Find something, anything...

941
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:32,314
Well, almost anything,
to stop that shine of yours.

942
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,153
Keep your head down and hope to God

943
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,709
that these people
or anything like them,

944
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,877
that they don't see you.

945
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,551
If they see you, they come back.

946
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,356
Abra, do you hear me?

947
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,476
They come back.

948
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,875
Keep your head down. Stay safe.

949
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,157
I'm sorry.

950
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:07,312
Hey, Azzie.

951
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:22,349
You got your wires crossed tonight.

952
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:23,919
[door creaks]

953
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,798
That room's empty, Az.

954
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,430
There's no one in that room.

955
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:44,234
Whoa! Hang on, Doc.

956
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:45,756
Dick.

957
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,275
Oh, I'm so sorry.

958
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,434
I... I... thought it was--

959
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,919
Thought I was from the Overlook.

960
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:54,271
Almost locked me up.

961
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,189
Still getting visits
from them old ghosts?

962
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,078
No, not for years.

963
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:02,517
Horace Derwent was the last one,
confetti on his suit.

964
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,478
Said, "Great party, isn't it?"

965
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:07,951
Shit-eating grin on his face
till I pulled out a box for him.

966
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,191
-That grin went fast.
-[chuckles]

967
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:13,030
Hey, it never occurred to me
to ask you back then.

968
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:15,072
What happens to them in those boxes?

969
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,560
Do they die in there?

970
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:17,636
Do you care?

971
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,595
I missed you.

972
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,159
Has it been a long time?

973
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:25,749
Can't tell.

974
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:30,151
This world is a dream of a dream
to me now.

975
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,440
Eight years. Little more.

976
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,194
Why are you here?

977
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,794
I'm here because it all comes round.

978
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,273
Ka's a wheel, Doc.

979
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:46,031
These empty devils ever found you

980
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,713
when you was a tyke,

981
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,070
if they'd even sniffed you,

982
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,117
you'd be long dead.

983
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,278
They eat screams,

984
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,791
and drink pain,

985
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,318
and they've noticed that little girl.

986
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:02,834
They might kill her,

987
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:05,760
might turn her,

988
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:10,393
or might keep her
till she's all used up,

989
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:11,834
and that'd be worst of all.

990
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,718
You can't let 'em.

991
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:17,435
Why me?

992
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,118
Because she found you.

993
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:23,673
Because she showed up.
Hell, Doc, why me?

994
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,516
You just walked on
into my kitchen one day,

995
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,034
and I'm still on the hook.

996
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:29,838
What the hell am I supposed to do?

997
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:34,277
Get her what she asked for.

998
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,711
You won't see me again, Doc.

999
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,678
This is my last dream.

1000
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:51,516
It seems to me you grew up fine, son,

1001
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,558
but you still owe a debt.

1002
01:13:58,760 --> 01:13:59,795
Pay it.

1003

1004
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,436
Hey.

1005
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:18,430
Hey, Mom.

1006
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,749
You feeling okay?

1007
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,069
We missed you at dinner.

1008
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,599
I'm okay. Just had a rough day.

1009
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,358
I'm flying out to see Momo
in the morning.

1010
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:33,839
I'll be back as soon as I can.

1011
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,434
ADs, is she...

1012
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,874
Is she gonna pull through this time?

1013
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:48,755
I don't know.

1014
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,395
I hope so.

1015
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:53,709
Tell her I love her.

You rubes. [scoffs]

1022
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:59,353
Spend your whole lives
making little boxes,

1023
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,274
little memories.

1024
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:05,479
Oh, you think they make you so rich.

1025
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,677
You should see mine, kiddo.

1026
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,919
Oh, my mind's a cathedral.

1027
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:18,873
Well, hi there.

1028
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:27,470

No.

Now we know.

1058
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,230
She was in my head!

-What?
-[Rose] Stealing!

1060

What does she know?

01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,640
I don't know. I don't know.

-[Rose] I don't know!

Not now!

1065

01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,234
I think he's cycling.

[whimpers]

[Abra] Uncle Dan! Uncle Dan, I hurt her.

1069
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:40,870
I really hurt her.

1070
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,189
I hurt her and she deserved it

1071
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:43,918
and that's not the best part.
The best part is...

1072
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,038
The best part is I got in her head.
I got in her head.

-Uncle Dan? Are you there?
-Oh, God, Abra.

What have you done?

Just talk to the kid.

If we're gonna do this,
then let's do this.

1079
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,269
Hi, Abra.

1080
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:23,475
I can hear you.

1081

[wheezing]

1082
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,319
I don't understand.

1083
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:30,990
[Rose] You will.

1084
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,837
I thought we lived forever.

1085
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,598
Did someone promise you that, Andi?

1086
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,836
Did someone say you're immortal?

1087
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:45,915
I said, "Live long, eat well."

1088
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,077
We can live long, very long.

1089
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:50,195
And we do,

1090
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,600
most of us.

1091
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:53,792
But we haven't been eating well.

1092
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:57,038
Not for a long time.

1093

Yes, love?

1096
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:12,514
I'm scared.

1097
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,990
No, you're not. [sniffs]

1098
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:18,792
You watched empires rise

1099
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,957
and fall. [sniffling]

Sailed across oceans,

1102
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,314
to new worlds,

1103
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:29,275
while you fed on

1104
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:33,513
kings, and princes, and popes.

1105
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,952
They wrote myths of you,

1106
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,678
and made statues,

1107
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:43,950
and they trembled
in their villages, and beds,

1108
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,429
and skyscrapers.

1109
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:49,957
-So, no...
-[gasps]

1110
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,835
...you're not scared.

1111
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,034
You're a king...

1112
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:59,791
and you eat fear.

1113
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,391
[labored breathing]

Hey, bro.

1121

You know, it's 4:00 a.m.

1122
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,113
You've always seen me, Billy.

1123
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:59,079
You have a good sense about people,
is that fair to say?

1124
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,070
Yeah, what--

1125
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,356
You think I'm an honest man? A good man?

1126
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:04,919
I do, I do. Dan, I--

1127
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,320
I need your help.

1128
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,277
The first thing I need is for you
to listen to a story

1129
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:10,874
and try harder than you've ever tried
to believe me.

1130
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:29,110
[Abra] How's it going?

1131
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,476
Oh, hey.

1132
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:33,119
Shouldn't you be
getting ready for school?

1133
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,191
Yeah, but I wanted to tag along.

1134
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,234
How long have you been driving?

1135
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:38,879
A few hours or so.

1136
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,519
We should get there tonight. Late.

1137
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:44,355
Who's that?

1138
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,149
He's my friend.

1139
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:48,759
Maybe my best friend.

1140
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:51,919
You should've seen her face.

1141
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:54,397
She was scared, Uncle Dan.

1142
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,232
Scared like all those kids were scared.

1143
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:57,919
All those kids she's killed.

1144
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:00,276
She was so mad
and so scared that I got in.

1145
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:02,194
That was a new trick.

1146
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:04,040
I've never done that before.

1147
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,357
Yeah, me neither. What was it like?

1148
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:08,514
Like a library.

1149
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:10,717
I guess we're all libraries inside.

1150
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:12,995
How'd you do it?

1151
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:15,596
Like this. Just a little push.

1152
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:16,511
[tires screech]

1153
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:21,791
Abra!

1154
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:24,315
-Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry!
-[grunts]

1155
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:30,833
-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
-It's okay.

1156
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,993
What were all those boxes?

1157
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:35,435
Nothing.

1158
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:36,590
Liar.

1159
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,160
When I was a kid,

1160
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:45,238
younger than you, I bumped
into something like these things

1161
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:47,231
that ate like they do.

1162
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:50,271
Only it wasn't a person, it was a place.

1163
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,277
They closed it down after
and let it rot.

1164
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:59,070
But the things that lived there, they...

1165
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:02,918
Don't go poking around in there again.

1166
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,476
Okay, I won't. I promise.

1167
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,272
[exhales heavily]

1168
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,157
We're almost ready.
We're just loading up.

1169
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:22,435
[Rose] Good.

1170
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,149
Get the caravan on the road

1171
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:25,679
and we'll have her in a day or two.

1172
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,398
I don't think you should come, Rosie.

1173
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:31,239
[scoffs] The fuck did you just say?

1174
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:32,469
She tagged you.

1175
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:33,550
She got in your head.

1176
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,274
Yeah, it won't happen again.

1177
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,636
And who knows how much she got to
before you kicked her out.

1178
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:39,074
She's mine, Crow.

1179
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,389
Right now, as far as we know,

1180
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:42,949
you are the only one of us
she could track.

1181
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,599
Now, if she sees you coming,

1182
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,314
she could run

1183
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,959
or set another trap.

1184
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:53,873
You know I'm right about this.

1185
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,671
If she pulls a trick on you...

1186
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:00,755
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1187
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,352
But I got some tricks of my own.

1188
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:13,109
[Billy] Hey, I think we're here.

1189
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,470
[Dan] Okay.

1190
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:20,274
I'll see if I can get her.

1191
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:22,670
Abra?

1192
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,398
[Abra] That's the sign.
Pull around back.

1193
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,919
She says to pull around back.

1194
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,035
And I'll tell you when to stop.

1195
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,633
She'll tell us when to stop.

1196
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,719
[Billy] I gotta tell you, Danno,

1197
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:42,792
I don't know whether I hope
you're right or wrong about this.

1198
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:46,555
I mean, if you're wrong,
my friend is crazy.

1199
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:50,349
I mean, full-blown, mental breakdown,

1200
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:54,149
imaginary-monsters-
killing-imaginary-kids

1201
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:55,230
bonkers.

1202
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:58,349
But, you know, I...
I can work with that.

1203
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,033
If you're right, though...

1204
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:02,269
I know.

1205
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:03,839
It's much worse.

1206
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:19,550
You should go home.

1207
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:20,950
What?

1208
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:22,869
No, not you.

1209
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,399
I can handle it.

1210
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:28,074
No. We'll take it from here.

1211
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:32,519
Okay, it's just us.

1212
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:51,279
You smell that?

1213
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:56,395
Used to hunt.
I ever tell you that?

1214
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:57,470
[Dan] No.

1215
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:58,875
Deer.

1216
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:00,550
This one summer,

1217
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:02,950
I clipped this buck.

1218
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,638
I was tracking it for two days.

1219
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:08,677
I got the shot, clipped him.

1220
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,079
He ran off, I went after.

1221
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:14,560
Figured he wasn't gonna last long.

1222
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,794
[panting]

1223
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:18,350
Then he vanished.

1224
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,991
Just up and evaporated.

1225
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:24,349
Not a trace. Truly baffling.

1226
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:28,679
Five days later,

1227
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,155
I'm trying a different spot, miles away.

1228
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:35,037
I come around
looking for a spot for a blind...

1229
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,109
then I smelled him.

1230
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:40,910
Smelled him.

1231
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:43,310
Found that buck

1232
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:46,760
holed up to a hollow trunk,

1233
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:48,639
dead for days.

1234
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:51,390
The smell...

1235
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,752
Never hunted a day since.

1236
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,073
This is the same smell.

1237
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:06,635
[Dan grunts]

1238
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:17,310
Billy.

1239
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,515
[both grunting]

1240
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:38,509
Oh, my God!

1241
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:43,439
[gagging]

1242
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:49,317
[both exclaim]

1243
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:52,399
[retching]

1244
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:57,675
[gagging]

1245
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:01,392
[Billy continues retching]

1246
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,315
[coughing]

1247
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,634
[groaning]

1248
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:12,236
[Billy] Fuck.

1249
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:15,069
Fuck, Danno. What the fuck?

1250
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:17,720
They didn't even bury him deep.
They buried him shallow.

1251
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:18,790
I'm sorry, Billy.

1252
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:21,789
[Billy] What did you get us into?

1253
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:32,199
[Billy] The people who did that...

1254
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:33,350
[Dan] They're not people.

1255
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:36,432
No. No, they ain't.

1256
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,113
Anyone do that to a little boy,

1257
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:41,630
they ain't people.

1258
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:44,080
[Abra] Did you get it?

1259
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:45,195
Yeah, we got it.

1260
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,270
Is she back?

1261
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,917
We're heading back to you.
We'll be back in the morning.

1262
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,274
We got a stop to make.

1263
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,830
I need you to show your parents
what's happening.

1264
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:56,556
No.

1265
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:59,519
-Yeah.
-No. They almost think I'm normal.

1266
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:00,874
If I tell them, they'll...

1267
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,792
[Dan] Rose'll go through them
to get to you.

1268
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,234
You know that, don't you?

1269
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,197
She'll cut them down
without a second thought.

1270
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:07,839
And she's coming, Abra.

1271
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:09,914
They need to know.

1272
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,354
[Abra sighs]

1273
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:16,639
So, what's this stop we gotta make?

1274
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:19,271
You still got those old deer rifles?

1275
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,110
You're Uncle Dan?

1276
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:40,273
-The fuck you think you are?
-Sir...

1277
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:42,317
Hmm? Hmm? She is 13 years old!

1278
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:43,754
Abra, I told you to show him.

1279
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:44,910
-1 told him.
-Well, that's not the same.

1280
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,354
I'm gonna kick your ass
before I call the police, huh?

1281
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:48,078
-Hey, hey, hey!
-No, no, no. Abra.

1282
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:49,195
Now, don't you say her name.

1283
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,270
Abra...

1284
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:53,795
-[David groaning]
-[screaming]

1285
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:59,309
[screaming stops]

1286
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:07,720
[Dan] I'm sorry, Mr. Stone.
I am a friend.

1287
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:10,272
Everything she told you is true.

1288
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:13,755
[bottle rattles]

1289
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:23,590
No, thanks.

1290
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:24,715
No.

1291
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,195
[bottle rattles]

1292
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:35,195
Those people...

1293
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:38,395
they know about my daughter?

1294
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:39,870
They do.

1295
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:43,229
And sooner or later, they're coming.

1296
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:44,469
We gotta do something.

1297
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,757
All right, we're calling the police,
the FBI...

1298
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:49,593
[Dan] These people have been around
a long, long time, sir.

1299
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:51,273
They're rich, connected.

1300
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:53,192
I don't think they're worried
about the police.

1301
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:55,279
But where are they?

1302
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:57,630
When are they coming?
Where can we go?

1303
01:33:57,720 --> 01:33:59,040
Abra can answer that...

1304
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:00,675
if she's ready.

1305
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,230
I'm ready.

1306
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:14,629
You sure you wanna do this?

1307
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:16,390
I have to.

1308
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:25,800
[sighs]

1309
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:00,155
1-95.

1310
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:02,955
Barry, the Crow, the Snake,
and a few others.

1311
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:04,794
The trees haven't changed that much,

1312
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:07,554
so maybe Massachusetts,

1313
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:09,478
-but they're close.
-Rose?

1314
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:10,675
Didn't see her.

1315
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:12,469
But they're coming.

1316
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:18,392
This is the only room she saw?

1317
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:20,355
That's right.

1318
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:23,159
And I made a few changes.
Hid a few things.

1319
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:24,910
All right.

1320
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,196
Well, they'll be trying to track you,

1321
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:29,759
trying to catch on.

1322
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:33,154
And you're gonna let them.

1323
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:35,994
Are you crazy?

1324
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:38,310
Possibly, but you're gonna let them.

1325
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,960
And then I need you to try
and do a little trick.

1326
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:42,915
A magic trick?

1327
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:52,354
They're following us.

1328
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:55,190
Concentrate.
You gotta keep it up until they land.

1329
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:57,030
I know.

1330
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:29,870
This should work.

1331
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:32,715
Good blinds over there, and there.

1332
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:37,190
They still close?

1333
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:38,554
Getting closer, I think.

1334
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:40,230
This is tough.

1335
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,675
I know. I know. Not much longer.

1336
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:47,999
Okay, Crow Daddy,

1337
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,195
go get her.

1338
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:39,193
You look relaxed.

1339
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:42,509
You feel relaxed, don't you, Abra?

1340
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:44,710
I guess.

1341
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:45,990
[Andi] You should.

1342
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:48,319
Just relax.

1343
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:49,834
We're friends.

1344
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:51,839
You're friends.

1345
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:53,069
[Andi] That's right.

1346
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:55,480
Just friends.

1347
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:59,432
And we want to take you
to meet more friends.

1348
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:02,189
Good friends.

1349
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:07,795
Well, shit.

1350
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:09,355
The way they talked you up,

1351
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:11,477
I was thinking
it'd be a little harder than that.

on the sad events today,

I'm so sorry.

But you're weak.

Haven't felt hungover in years.
And, you know, I don't miss it.

01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:30,071
Haven't seen this one before.

1493
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:31,559
Wanna see one more?

1494
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:38,192
Don't imagine Rose'll be too happy
if you shoot the prize.

1495
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:44,033
I don't suppose Rose will be happy
about any of this.

1496
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,678
And when that woman gets mad...

1497
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:49,989
Well, it seems to me you know enough

1498
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:52,071
to know you might wanna
sit this one out.

1499
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:54,553
Count your blessings.

1500
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:55,630
Go on your way.

1501
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:57,834
[chuckles]

1502
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:00,073
What's so funny, friend?

1503
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:04,194
Well, it's just arrogance.
It's arrogance, really.

1504
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:07,079
But it makes sense,
if you think you're gonna live forever.

1505
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:11,754
Stands to reason, of course
you wouldn't wear your seatbelt.

1506

[gasps] No!

1509
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:36,549
Dan?

1510
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:39,354
Dan?

1511
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:41,078
[soft snarling]

01:49:10,640 --> 01:49:12,119
I hope that hurts.

01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:13,989
Rosie...

1515
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:16,109
A lot.

[pained screaming]

1517
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:06,316
You little bitch.

1518
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:09,909
What have you done?

1519
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:23,558
All right, bitch child.

1520
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:25,710
All right.

1523
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:34,916
Sorry.

1524
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:36,394
Dozed off.

1525
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:37,993
No, you earned it.

1526
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:42,800
Where are we?

1527
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:43,870
Ohio.

1528
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:45,916
Where are we going?

1529
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:46,910
Colorado.

1530
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:50,073
Why Colorado?

1531
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:54,160
She's gonna keep coming.

1532
01:51:55,560 --> 01:51:57,039
-I know.
-Always.

1533
01:51:58,520 --> 01:51:59,954
This only ends if we end it,

1534
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:02,156
and I don't think we can beat her.

1535
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:03,594
Not by ourselves.

1536
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:07,674
There's a place.

1537
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:09,671
A place that's dangerous
for people like us.

1538
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:13,632
The place you told me about?
The hungry place?

1539
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:14,710
Yeah, that's right.

1540
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:17,633
If it's so dangerous,
why would we go there?

1541
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:20,231
Well, if it's dangerous
for people like us,

1542
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:22,914
I expect it's dangerous
for people like her.

1543
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:25,194
Maybe even more so.

1544
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:27,310
Good.

1545
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:30,153
She's following us, you know.

1546
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:32,993
Yeah, good. Let her.

1547
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:42,553
I'm sorry about your father.

1548
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:46,753
Sorry about your friend.

[cell phone vibrating]

01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:13,269
What do I say to her?

[mutters]

1553
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:19,071
Hi, Mom.

1554
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:20,355
Oh, thank God!

1555
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:21,550
Abra... [sniffling]

1556
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:23,199
Are you okay? Where are you?

1557
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:25,230
I love you.

1558
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:27,675
[cell phone clicks]

1559
01:53:28,440 --> 01:53:30,954
When we're safe, you'll call her
and tell her where to find us?

1560
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:32,110
I will.

1561
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:33,230
Okay.

1562
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:40,875
[cell phone clatters]

1563
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:09,396
Not too much further.
Up the mountain.

[wind whistling]

1565

Here's what we're gonna do.

1566
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:49,678
You're gonna stay in the car,
keep the heater running.

1567
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:52,991
I don't want you spending a minute
inside there if you don't have to.

1568
01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:54,753
She can only come from here.

1569
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:56,274
You can see her a mile out, easy.

1570
01:55:56,360 --> 01:55:58,510
You see lights
on the mountain over there,

1571
01:55:58,600 --> 01:56:00,113
you blast me, okay?

1572
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:02,430
But I don't want you going in.
Not until she's here.

1573
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:05,631
You aren't waiting with me?

1574
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:07,110
I can't.

1575
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:08,190
Why not?

1576
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,320
I have to wake it up.

[man] Slow night, Mr. Torrance.

1592
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:31,478
Not for long, I imagine.

1593
02:01:33,320 --> 02:01:35,311
[man] You're a whiskey man, are you not?

1594
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:37,391
I was, most of the time.

1595
02:01:45,160 --> 02:01:46,514
[man] On the house.

1596
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:51,799
This was your brand.

1597
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:53,670
Jack Daniel's.

1598
02:01:54,360 --> 02:01:56,636
I used to see the bottles in our home.

1599
02:01:56,720 --> 02:01:58,552
Our real home, before all this.

1600
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:03,397
I smelled one once.
It smelled like something on fire,

1601
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:05,960
which I suppose it was.

1602
02:02:07,400 --> 02:02:09,550
[man] I'm afraid you've confused me
with someone else.

1603
02:02:09,640 --> 02:02:10,994
It's Lloyd.

1604
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:13,150
Lloyd.

1605
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:16,716
I apologize, Mr. Torrance.

1606
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:20,031
I don't know where everyone is,
but it'll pick up.

1607
02:02:20,760 --> 02:02:22,194
Oh, I know where they are.

1608
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:23,750
And you're right...

1609
02:02:25,080 --> 02:02:26,070
it'll pick up.

1610
02:02:28,120 --> 02:02:30,873
If you don't mind my saying,
Mr. Torrance, you seem...

1611
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:33,470
put upon.

1612
02:02:34,440 --> 02:02:35,589
Put upon?

1613
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:37,793
Pulled into other people's problems.

1614
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:40,713
I see it all the time,
if you don't mind my saying.

1615
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:45,512
So we lived in Florida.

1616
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:47,590
I'm sorry?

1617
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:48,875
Mom and I.

1618
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:53,076
We never wanted to see snow again,

1619
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:56,117
so we lived in Florida.

1620
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:58,635
Tiny place, but it was comfortable,
and we were happy.

1621
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:02,513
I was 20 when she died.

1622
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:07,149
And back then,
I saw when someone was gonna die.

1623
02:03:07,240 --> 02:03:09,470
I saw flies. Black flies.

1624
02:03:09,560 --> 02:03:12,552
"Death flies," I called them,
circling people's faces.

1625
02:03:13,320 --> 02:03:15,960
And in those last weeks,
she was covered...

1626
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:17,792
Her whole face.

1627
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:19,791
I could barely see her eyes.

1628
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:26,036
And I... I tried to comfort her,
but I could hardly look at her.

1629
02:03:26,120 --> 02:03:27,349
And she saw that.

1630
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:36,910
Maybe something warm to push away
such unpleasantries.

1631
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,958
Don't you wanna hear about it?
She was your wife.

1632
02:03:40,040 --> 02:03:43,032
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

1633
02:03:43,120 --> 02:03:45,077
-I'm just a bartender.
-Oh, yeah?

1634
02:03:46,600 --> 02:03:49,592
Just Lloyd the bartender,
pouring joy at the Overlook Hotel.

1635
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:52,069
I'll pour whatever you like,
Mr. Torrance.

1636
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:00,920
Man takes a drink,

1637
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:03,880
the drink takes a drink,

1638
02:04:05,200 --> 02:04:06,952
and then the drink takes a man.

1639
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:09,439
Ain't it so, Dad?

1640
02:04:13,880 --> 02:04:15,029
Medicine.

1641
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:18,711
Medicine is what it is.

1642
02:04:19,720 --> 02:04:21,438
Bona fide cure-all.

1643
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:24,636
The mind is a blackboard.

1644
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:26,629
And this

1645
02:04:27,400 --> 02:04:28,595
is the eraser.

1646
02:04:33,960 --> 02:04:35,439
A man tries.

1647
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:37,509
He provides.

1648
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:40,631
But he's surrounded by mouths.

1649
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:42,958
And a family.

1650
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:45,077
A wife, a kid.

1651
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:48,232
Those mouths eat time.

1652
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:50,758
They eat your days on earth.

1653
02:04:51,960 --> 02:04:53,280
They just gobble them up.

1654
02:04:55,160 --> 02:04:57,310
It's enough to make a man sick.

1655
02:04:58,640 --> 02:04:59,550
And this...

1656

Why is that?

I was just like you when I was younger.

I was special

and alone.

1723

But I met someone who gave me
the gift of purpose, of community.

1724
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:16,111
And I might have given you such a gift

-...and ever...

[breathing heavily]

1829
02:18:01,400 --> 02:18:02,390
[Abra] Uncle Dan.

1830
02:18:03,800 --> 02:18:05,473
Uncle Dan, is it done?

1831
02:18:05,600 --> 02:18:07,511
-[panting]
-Is she dead?

1832

1834
02:18:29,800 --> 02:18:31,598
Great party, isn't it?

1835
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:33,469
[Dan] Abra!

1836
02:18:37,360 --> 02:18:38,475
Abra!

1837
02:18:55,280 --> 02:18:56,429
[muffled] Abra!

1838
02:19:02,760 --> 02:19:04,159
Abra!

1839
02:19:05,560 --> 02:19:06,755
[water trickles]

1840
02:19:06,840 --> 02:19:07,910
[Abra sniffs]

1841
02:19:22,680 --> 02:19:23,829
Try it.

1842
02:19:27,080 --> 02:19:28,354
Oh, there you are.

1843
02:19:28,800 --> 02:19:29,835
Abra.

1844
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:32,991
You've been very, very bad.

1845
02:19:33,680 --> 02:19:35,034
You're not Uncle Dan.

1846
02:19:35,920 --> 02:19:38,753
You're a mask. A false face.

1847
02:19:40,200 --> 02:19:41,474
[multiple voices]
Who else would I be?

1848
02:19:41,600 --> 02:19:42,476
[Abra] You're the hotel.

1849
02:19:43,400 --> 02:19:44,629
But he's still in there.

1850
02:19:44,720 --> 02:19:46,119
Mask is off, then.

1851
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:52,793
Why are you smiling?

1852
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:55,271
Because you don't know
where you're standing.

1853
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:59,434
[scoffs] I know these halls
like my own face, child.

1854
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:01,193
I mean the body you're standing in.

1855
02:20:01,640 --> 02:20:03,313
The face you're wearing.

1856
02:20:03,400 --> 02:20:05,471
That's Dan Torrance,
and you don't know him.

1857
02:20:05,560 --> 02:20:07,278
Dan Torrance.

1858
02:20:07,360 --> 02:20:10,955
Dan Torrance made one stop
as soon as he got here.

1859
02:20:11,880 --> 02:20:13,200
To the boiler room.

1860
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:20,910
[grunts]

-[grunts]
-There you are.

1864
02:20:41,880 --> 02:20:43,473
[in normal voice]
You were supposed to run.

1865
02:20:43,560 --> 02:20:45,153
I didn't wanna leave you.

1866
02:20:45,440 --> 02:20:47,317
[breathing heavily]

1867
02:20:48,160 --> 02:20:50,071
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.

1868
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:54,560
I can't hold it off for much longer.
Abra, you need to run.

1869
02:20:54,640 --> 02:20:55,675
No.

1870
02:20:55,800 --> 02:20:57,552
I'm not going anywhere without you.

1871
02:20:57,640 --> 02:21:00,109
I have to close
the door behind us, right?

1872
02:21:01,040 --> 02:21:02,314
Run! Run!

1873
02:21:02,720 --> 02:21:04,279

1883
02:23:16,880 --> 02:23:17,995
[Abra] Come on, Uncle Dan.

1884
02:23:18,760 --> 02:23:20,080
Get out of there.

1885
02:23:21,400 --> 02:23:22,629
Come on.

1886
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:25,798
[sirens approaching]

1887
02:23:34,200 --> 02:23:35,713
The fire spread fast,

1888
02:23:36,680 --> 02:23:38,512
destroying the hotel.

1889
02:23:38,600 --> 02:23:39,954
Purifying it.

1890
02:23:41,600 --> 02:23:43,591
I could almost hear it...

1891
02:23:43,680 --> 02:23:44,715
screaming.

1892
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:47,479
I could hear it dying.

1893
02:23:48,560 --> 02:23:51,359
And deep inside, I knew...

1894
02:23:54,160 --> 02:23:55,594
I knew you were okay.

1895
02:23:57,480 --> 02:23:59,278
I'm sorry I put you in danger.

1896
02:24:00,480 --> 02:24:01,629
It was the only way.

1897
02:24:02,880 --> 02:24:03,870
I know.

1898
02:24:05,280 --> 02:24:08,318
Do you think she was right

1899
02:24:08,400 --> 02:24:10,471
when she said she wasn't the last one?

1900
02:24:11,800 --> 02:24:13,234
The world's a hungry place.

1901
02:24:14,240 --> 02:24:15,389
A dark place.

1902
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:19,513
Maybe there's more of them
or things like them or worse,

1903
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:22,312
but there are more people like you, too.

1904
02:24:23,080 --> 02:24:24,400
People who stand.

1905
02:24:28,280 --> 02:24:29,918
I told you when I first met you,

1906
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,753
I told you that you should hide.

1907
02:24:34,320 --> 02:24:36,072
That you should keep your head down.

1908
02:24:37,400 --> 02:24:39,038
Keep your shine out of sight.

1909
02:24:41,360 --> 02:24:42,589
But I was wrong.

1910
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,673
Shine on, Abra Stone.

1911
02:24:50,800 --> 02:24:51,949
You shine on.

1912
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:54,474
[chuckles softly]

1913

-[knock on door]
-[Lucy] Dinner's ready.

1914
02:25:00,120 --> 02:25:01,349
Who are you talking to?

1915
02:25:03,880 --> 02:25:04,870
No one.

1916
02:25:05,320 --> 02:25:06,469
Hmm.

1917
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:14,633
That's not true.

1918
02:25:18,600 --> 02:25:19,829
I was talking to Dan.

1919
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:30,070
We go on after.

1920
02:25:30,920 --> 02:25:31,910
We go on.

1921
02:25:32,840 --> 02:25:33,989
And he's okay.

1922
02:25:35,160 --> 02:25:36,150
So is Daddy.

1923
02:25:37,720 --> 02:25:38,994
He really is.

1924
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:44,070
Good.

1925
02:25:55,840 --> 02:25:57,194
You coming, sweetheart?

1926
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:00,990
In a minute.

1930
02:27:08,600 --> 02:27:14,278
Midnight and a rendezvous

1931
02:27:15,400 --> 02:27:20,759
Your eyes held a message tender

1932
02:27:20,840 --> 02:27:27,473
Saying "I surrender all my love to you"

1933
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:35,676
Midnight brought us sweet romance

1934

I know all my whole life through

1935
02:27:43,920 --> 02:27:47,072
I'll be remembering you

1936
