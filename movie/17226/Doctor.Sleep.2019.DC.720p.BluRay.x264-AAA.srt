00:00:45,351 --> 00:00:46,995
Where you going, Violet?

3
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:48,996
Just to pick some flowers.

4
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,990
Don't wander too far.

5
00:01:23,922 --> 00:01:29,370
<i>♪ My wild Irish rose ♪</i>

10
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,049
Well, hi there.

11
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:52,194
Where did you find those?

12
00:01:52,218 --> 00:01:54,829
I know all the secret places.

13
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:56,221
Do you want one?

14
00:02:06,165 --> 00:02:07,475
You're wondering
why I'm wearing

15
00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:09,810
such a funny hat.

16
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:12,481
I always wear this hat.

17
00:02:12,505 --> 00:02:15,183
So much, it's a part of
my name now.

18
00:02:15,207 --> 00:02:17,119
My friends...

19
00:02:17,143 --> 00:02:21,356
my very, very best friends,
they just call me Rose the Hat.

20
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,458
It looks like a magician's hat.

21
00:02:24,482 --> 00:02:26,194
It is.

22
00:02:26,218 --> 00:02:28,797
It's a magic hat.

23
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:29,889
Do you wanna see?

24
00:02:31,923 --> 00:02:33,258
Nothing up my sleeves.

25
00:02:34,994 --> 00:02:37,163
Nothing in my hat.

26
00:02:40,365 --> 00:02:41,375
Don't worry, that's my friend.

27
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:43,310
You're missing the trick.

28
00:02:43,334 --> 00:02:45,037
Reach inside.

29
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,452
Wow!

30
00:02:51,476 --> 00:02:52,853
It's so pretty.

31
00:02:52,877 --> 00:02:54,321
Because it's special.

32
00:02:54,345 --> 00:02:56,458
And speaking of special,

33
00:02:56,482 --> 00:02:58,752
you're a little magic, too,
aren't you?

34
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,322
The flower in my hand,
what color is it?

35
00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:07,369
Oh, it's okay, honey.

36
00:03:07,393 --> 00:03:09,496
You won't scare me. I promise.

37
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:12,374
Purple.

38
00:03:18,369 --> 00:03:19,805
Violet...

39
00:03:20,371 --> 00:03:21,907
like you.

40
00:03:24,577 --> 00:03:26,821
You don't eat flowers.

41
00:03:26,845 --> 00:03:27,988
But you do.

42
00:03:28,012 --> 00:03:30,292
But these are special.

43
00:03:30,316 --> 00:03:34,053
Honey, it's the special ones
that taste best.

44
00:03:37,155 --> 00:03:39,133
I should get back to my mom.

45
00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:41,928
No, stay. Stay awhile.
See more magic.

46
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:48,309
Ow.

47
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,376
You are
a special little thing,

48
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
aren't you?

49
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,285
Violet?

50
00:03:59,178 --> 00:04:00,213
Violet!

51
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:08,321
Violet!

52
00:04:11,423 --> 00:04:12,423
Vi...

53
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:45,769
Please.

54
00:07:52,678 --> 00:07:55,148
Hey. It's okay, Doc.

55
00:07:56,315 --> 00:07:57,750
It's okay.

56
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:05,099
There.

57
00:08:05,123 --> 00:08:06,558
All dry.

58
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,603
Phew.

59
00:08:09,627 --> 00:08:11,264
What happened?

60
00:08:14,298 --> 00:08:16,501
You have to talk to me, Danny.

61
00:08:17,902 --> 00:08:20,205
You haven't talked
since we left...

62
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,375
Please, Doc.

63
00:08:25,344 --> 00:08:27,113
Please.

64
00:09:17,695 --> 00:09:19,641
So...

65
00:09:19,665 --> 00:09:22,468
you ain't talking, huh, Doc?

66
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:29,709
Weren't talking much first time
I met you neither.

67
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,820
Little boy...

68
00:09:33,844 --> 00:09:38,325
set to spend a long winter
at that rotten old place.

69
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:40,661
Just him and his mommy
and daddy.

70
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:43,522
Daddy as dark as
that boy is bright.

71
00:09:44,623 --> 00:09:46,633
And, boy, is he bright.

72
00:09:46,657 --> 00:09:49,361
He's shining like fire...

73
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:52,739
in the one place...

74
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:55,467
the worst place for
someone who shines.

75
00:09:57,868 --> 00:10:00,681
You remember the first time
we really talked?

76
00:10:00,705 --> 00:10:04,384
When I spoke up
inside your head?

77
00:10:04,408 --> 00:10:06,653
<i>Made you feel good, right?</i>

78
00:10:06,677 --> 00:10:08,522
<i>Knowing you weren't alone.</i>

79
00:10:08,546 --> 00:10:09,916
Daddy tried to kill me.

80
00:10:11,717 --> 00:10:13,795
It wasn't all him,
you gotta know.

81
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:18,599
That place fed his dark,
like it fed on your light.

82
00:10:18,623 --> 00:10:20,859
And he had
some light in him, too.

83
00:10:21,993 --> 00:10:24,638
Just like you got some dark.

84
00:10:24,662 --> 00:10:26,674
We all got both.

85
00:10:26,698 --> 00:10:28,334
It's not done with me.

86
00:10:30,334 --> 00:10:34,449
It ever strike you funny
how I showed up when I did?

87
00:10:34,473 --> 00:10:36,450
When you needed me.

88
00:10:36,474 --> 00:10:38,777
Someone did that for me, too.

89
00:10:39,877 --> 00:10:42,690
My grandma taught me,

90
00:10:42,714 --> 00:10:44,725
and I taught you.

91
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:48,930
And some day, Danny Torrance,
you'll teach someone else.

92
00:10:48,954 --> 00:10:50,356
I won't.

93
00:10:51,422 --> 00:10:52,599
Oh, you won't, huh?

94
00:10:52,623 --> 00:10:54,334
I won't shine, I mean.

95
00:10:54,358 --> 00:10:56,796
No more. It's dangerous.

96
00:10:58,497 --> 00:11:00,766
Reckon it is sometimes.

97
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:03,277
She found me.

98
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:05,570
She'll come back and come back
until she gets me.

99
00:11:06,872 --> 00:11:08,616
You're right.

100
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,852
The Overlook's condemned.
Boarded up.

101
00:11:10,876 --> 00:11:12,619
They're starvin' old ghosts,

102
00:11:12,643 --> 00:11:14,722
and they're reachin' out
for you.

103
00:11:14,746 --> 00:11:16,858
Won't stop with her, either.

104
00:11:16,882 --> 00:11:19,026
Pictures in a book.

105
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,770
You said they were just pictures in
a book and they couldn't hurt me.

106
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,767
Some things,

107
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:30,772
dark things,
the shining's like food.

108
00:11:30,796 --> 00:11:33,498
They're mosquitoes
landing for blood.

109
00:11:36,368 --> 00:11:37,945
The Overlook,

110
00:11:37,969 --> 00:11:41,849
it was always
just pictures to me.

111
00:11:41,873 --> 00:11:44,443
But I didn't shine like you.

112
00:11:45,444 --> 00:11:48,388
Nobody shines like you.

113
00:11:48,412 --> 00:11:52,959
So, you in that damn hotel, you
was like a million-watt battery

114
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:54,728
all plugged in.

115
00:11:54,752 --> 00:11:55,863
And it ate it up.

116
00:11:55,887 --> 00:11:57,565
You made it real.

117
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:01,435
Started soon as you
walked through the door.

118
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:03,771
Can't do nothing about that,
I'm sorry to tell you,

119
00:12:03,795 --> 00:12:05,006
but you're not a child.

120
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,041
You're older now.

121
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:09,344
Much older, in a way.

122
00:12:09,368 --> 00:12:10,835
You gotta hear this.

123
00:12:11,902 --> 00:12:15,483
World's a hungry place.

124
00:12:15,507 --> 00:12:19,487
And the darkest things are the
hungriest, and they'll eat what shines.

125
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:22,890
Swarm it like mosquitoes
or leeches.

126
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:24,617
Can't do nothing about that.

127
00:12:27,051 --> 00:12:29,830
What you can do...

128
00:12:29,854 --> 00:12:33,392
is turn what they come for
against 'em.

129
00:12:37,396 --> 00:12:38,863
My grandfather,

130
00:12:40,098 --> 00:12:42,535
he was a mean son of a bitch.

131
00:12:44,402 --> 00:12:45,747
Dark inside.

132
00:12:45,771 --> 00:12:48,516
Same type of dark as your dad.

133
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,017
Beat me senseless,
and my grandma, too,

134
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,720
and when he died, I danced.

135
00:12:53,744 --> 00:12:56,481
But he kept on coming back.

136
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,826
Standing in my room.

137
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,530
Suit all gray and stinkin'

138
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:05,358
from whatever mold was
growin' on him in that box.

139
00:13:06,825 --> 00:13:11,097
One day, he grabbed me,
and he was real.

140
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,474
His nails were long

141
00:13:14,498 --> 00:13:15,877
from growing in the grave,

142
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:18,679
and they cut me, Doc.

143
00:13:18,703 --> 00:13:20,473
Cut me deep.

144
00:13:21,705 --> 00:13:23,475
So, Grandma,

145
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,380
she taught me a trick.

146
00:13:30,648 --> 00:13:32,384
Gave me a present.

147
00:13:34,084 --> 00:13:37,589
I want you to know this box...

148
00:13:38,489 --> 00:13:40,568
inside and out.

149
00:13:40,592 --> 00:13:42,795
Don't just look at it.
Touch it.

150
00:13:44,896 --> 00:13:47,565
Stick your nose inside
and see if there's a smell.

151
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:51,012
Know every corner,

152
00:13:51,036 --> 00:13:53,113
every single thing.

153
00:13:53,137 --> 00:13:55,016
Why?

154
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,020
Because you're gonna build one
just like it in your mind.

155
00:13:59,044 --> 00:14:00,713
One even more special.

156
00:14:03,547 --> 00:14:05,884
So next time
that bitch comes around,

157
00:14:08,152 --> 00:14:09,488
you'll be ready.

158
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:14,634
Let's get you back to Mama.

159
00:14:14,658 --> 00:14:16,603
Wendy'll worry,

160
00:14:16,627 --> 00:14:19,632
and she shouldn't have to worry
another day in her life.

161
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:24,436
That woman's paid her debt.

162
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:29,974
Danny!

163
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:33,045
Danny!

164
00:14:35,647 --> 00:14:37,081
Danny!

165
00:14:38,116 --> 00:14:40,527
There you are.

166
00:14:40,551 --> 00:14:42,620
Where did you go, huh?

167
00:14:44,256 --> 00:14:46,225
You scared me half to death.

168
00:14:48,026 --> 00:14:50,838
Don't you do that to me.
You hear?

169
00:14:50,862 --> 00:14:53,541
Don't you ever do that to me.

170
00:14:53,565 --> 00:14:54,934
Don't ever do that to me.

171
00:15:00,972 --> 00:15:04,886
<i>Eh, what's up, Doc?</i>

172
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,054
<i>What's the bit?</i>

173
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:10,090
<i>What's cookin'?</i>

174
00:15:10,114 --> 00:15:13,194
<i>What's cooking,
little friend? Why, you are.</i>

175
00:15:13,218 --> 00:15:14,728
<i>Me?</i>

176
00:15:14,752 --> 00:15:17,223
<i>Why, yes.</i>

177
00:15:19,156 --> 00:15:21,960
<i>Ouch! You're killing me!</i>

178
00:15:23,561 --> 00:15:24,629
<i>Ouch!</i>

179
00:15:30,602 --> 00:15:33,005
<i>Agony! Agony!</i>

180
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:13,286
<i>Let me see now.</i>

181
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,022
<i>It is obvious that
this is no ordinary rabbit.</i>

182
00:16:16,046 --> 00:16:20,728
<i>Therefore, I must dream up a brilliant
master strategy, ingenious...</i>

183
00:16:20,752 --> 00:16:22,162
You okay, Doc?

184
00:16:22,186 --> 00:16:24,765
<i>Now, uh, what if I lured him...</i>

185
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:26,834
- Yeah, Mom. I'm okay.
- <i>...into a rock crusher?</i>

186
00:16:26,858 --> 00:16:29,002
<i>Nah, nah, nah,
too complicated.</i>

187
00:16:29,026 --> 00:16:32,772
<i>Yeah, yeah,
too complicated. But what if I...</i>

188
00:16:32,796 --> 00:16:34,709
<i>Uh-uh,
too much detail.</i>

189
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:36,109
<i>Right.
Too much detail.</i>

190
00:17:01,925 --> 00:17:02,969
And what's
your name again, cutie?

191
00:17:02,993 --> 00:17:04,037
Dan.

192
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:05,096
<i>Dan.</i>

193
00:17:39,998 --> 00:17:42,176
<i>I was having a drink
with the lady, all right?</i>

194
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:05,232
Hey. You're gonna
take your medicine.

195
00:18:05,256 --> 00:18:06,099
Get off him.

196
00:18:06,123 --> 00:18:07,358
Get up. Get out of here.

197
00:18:28,246 --> 00:18:30,090
Shit.
I think you killed him.

198
00:18:30,114 --> 00:18:32,926
What if you killed him?

199
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,427
I hope you killed him.

200
00:18:34,451 --> 00:18:36,196
You hear me?

201
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:39,190
Let me kiss it better.

202
00:18:49,234 --> 00:18:50,269
No.

203
00:18:51,068 --> 00:18:53,079
No, no, no.

204
00:18:53,103 --> 00:18:55,316
No, no, no, no, no, no.

205
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,752
Whoa. What the... No.

206
00:19:42,386 --> 00:19:44,288
Mommy?

207
00:19:52,296 --> 00:19:53,998
What's your name, hero?

208
00:19:59,136 --> 00:20:01,205
- Mommy?
- Baby.

209
00:20:02,006 --> 00:20:04,042
Here, here.

210
00:20:10,414 --> 00:20:13,426
<i>You can put
her money back, Doc.</i>

211
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,862
<i>You can do that much.</i>

212
00:20:15,886 --> 00:20:17,598
She took mine.

213
00:20:17,622 --> 00:20:20,466
She probably bought the coke
with it.

214
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,859
Doc.

215
00:20:34,171 --> 00:20:35,916
No, no, Doc.

216
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,551
You can put things from
the Overlook away in boxes,

217
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:39,443
but not memories.

218
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:42,255
Never those.

219
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:44,591
They're the real ghosts.

220
00:20:44,615 --> 00:20:46,584
You take them with you.

221
00:21:29,526 --> 00:21:31,170
Time for bed, Abra.

222
00:21:31,194 --> 00:21:32,906
A little more.

223
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,340
No more, sweetie.

224
00:21:34,364 --> 00:21:35,975
Big day tomorrow.

225
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:37,176
- Birthday party!
- That's right.

226
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,212
Yeah.

227
00:21:38,236 --> 00:21:39,946
Now, what time is it?

228
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,130
- Bedtime.
- You know it's bedtime.

229
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:45,110
Good night, sweetheart.

230
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:03,763

<i>Henri wants us to finish
this bottle and then three more.</i>

236
00:23:24,508 --> 00:23:26,352
Andi?

237
00:23:26,376 --> 00:23:27,154
<i>Says he'll water
his garden with champagne...</i>

238
00:23:27,178 --> 00:23:28,755
That's right.

239
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:30,791
<i>...before he'll let
the Germans drink it.</i>

240
00:23:30,815 --> 00:23:32,291
<i>This sort of takes the
sting out of being occupied.</i>

241
00:23:32,315 --> 00:23:34,160
You're prettier
than your picture.

242
00:23:34,184 --> 00:23:35,195
- <i>Doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
- You said it.</i>

243
00:23:35,219 --> 00:23:37,122
And you're older than yours.

244
00:23:38,689 --> 00:23:42,694
Are we staying here
or going somewhere?

245
00:23:45,296 --> 00:23:47,206
Don't you wanna
watch the movie?

246
00:24:00,344 --> 00:24:02,156
I don't see
what the fuss is about.

247
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,357
Chat room romance.

248
00:24:03,381 --> 00:24:06,060
Little gross. Not interesting.

249
00:24:06,084 --> 00:24:09,096
Just watch.
It's interesting, I promise.

250
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,066
Well, it better be, 'cause
she's not all that steamy.

251
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,069
And there she goes.

252
00:24:15,093 --> 00:24:16,795
Aren't you tired?

253
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:19,797
Sleep.

254
00:24:31,275 --> 00:24:32,677
Okay.

255
00:24:39,283 --> 00:24:42,295
Wait. This is the best part.

256
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:44,822
I watched her do it three times
now and it never gets old.

257
00:24:46,657 --> 00:24:48,468
Sleep deeper,

258
00:24:48,492 --> 00:24:51,338
deep as you can.

259
00:24:51,362 --> 00:24:54,766
The pain you feel
is only a dream.

260
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:58,103
What will the pain be?

261
00:24:59,603 --> 00:25:01,172
A dream.

262
00:25:03,774 --> 00:25:07,788
You can explain a lost wallet

263
00:25:07,812 --> 00:25:10,756
when your wife asks.

264
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:13,260
But you can't explain this.

265
00:25:14,818 --> 00:25:18,190
This you'll see every day
when you look in the mirror.

266
00:25:19,457 --> 00:25:21,702
And every time you see it,

267
00:25:21,726 --> 00:25:24,161
you'll say out loud...

268
00:25:25,696 --> 00:25:28,908
"I like little girls."

269
00:25:28,932 --> 00:25:31,402
You'll say it out loud.

270
00:25:31,902 --> 00:25:34,514
Out loud.

271
00:25:34,538 --> 00:25:40,354
And the next time you go looking
for a little girl online,

272
00:25:40,378 --> 00:25:43,423
I want you to
remember that time

273
00:25:43,447 --> 00:25:45,550
you got bit by a snake.

274
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,862
A snake in a white blouse

275
00:25:49,886 --> 00:25:51,690
whose face is a blank.

276
00:26:01,565 --> 00:26:03,634
- That is interesting.
- Mm-hmm.

277
00:26:12,977 --> 00:26:15,289
Excuse me, miss?

278
00:26:15,313 --> 00:26:17,791
Miss. Miss, you left something
in the theater.

279
00:26:17,815 --> 00:26:19,151
You wanna leave me alone.

280
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,860
Well, hi there.

281
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,562
You wanna let me go.

282
00:26:33,264 --> 00:26:35,567
Oh, no, sweetie.

283
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:38,435
No, I don't.

284
00:27:36,826 --> 00:27:38,829
How far can I get for this?

285
00:28:03,953 --> 00:28:07,533
Four of spades.
What color is this?

286
00:28:07,557 --> 00:28:10,503
Mommy, I made this for you.
It's a secret card.

287
00:28:10,527 --> 00:28:12,371
Mm,
thank you, Abba-doo.

288
00:28:12,395 --> 00:28:15,074
Does anyone know a magic word?

289
00:28:15,098 --> 00:28:18,845
- Ooh, ooh.
- Uh... You.

290
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:20,513
Abracadabra.

291
00:28:20,537 --> 00:28:21,915
Abracadabra.
That's a great one.

292
00:28:21,939 --> 00:28:24,276
Okay, you hold the magic wand.

293
00:28:25,042 --> 00:28:27,420
Now, everyone,

294
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:30,389
on the count of three, okay?

295
00:28:30,413 --> 00:28:33,327
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

296
00:28:33,351 --> 00:28:36,797
Abracadabra.

297
00:28:36,821 --> 00:28:38,831
I know magic, too.

298
00:28:38,855 --> 00:28:43,002
Well, then you get to hold him,
birthday girl.

299
00:28:43,026 --> 00:28:46,439
- There you go. You got him?
- Oh.

300
00:28:46,463 --> 00:28:49,108
For my next trick...
Oh, my goodness. Sorry.

301
00:28:49,132 --> 00:28:51,544
Sometimes, if I...

302
00:28:51,568 --> 00:28:54,080
Sorry.

303
00:28:54,104 --> 00:28:56,515
Has anyone seen my spoons?

304
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:58,351
I can do that.

305
00:28:58,375 --> 00:28:59,919
That's nice, sweetie.

306
00:28:59,943 --> 00:29:01,454
- They're on you!
- Oh, they're on me?

307
00:29:01,478 --> 00:29:02,755
Okay, make sure you guys
don't do this.

308
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:04,915
Oh!

309
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:17,537
Uh... We can forget
about naptime.

310
00:29:17,561 --> 00:29:19,364
- Just a few more hours.
- Mm.

311
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:25,445
Say it with me.
"Just a few more hours."

312
00:29:25,469 --> 00:29:27,037
Just a few more hours.

313
00:29:33,411 --> 00:29:34,778
What the hell?

314
00:29:43,687 --> 00:29:45,023
Dave...

315
00:29:58,001 --> 00:29:59,636
Abracadabra.

316
00:30:39,677 --> 00:30:40,720
Oops.

317
00:30:40,744 --> 00:30:42,789
Well, hi there, sleepyhead.

318
00:30:42,813 --> 00:30:44,491
Sorry.

319
00:30:44,515 --> 00:30:46,859
I had to sleep you pretty hard.

320
00:30:46,883 --> 00:30:48,861
You're a tough one.

321
00:30:48,885 --> 00:30:50,496
Willful.

322
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,131
You know, I checked.

323
00:30:52,155 --> 00:30:54,667
Six men in three months

324
00:30:54,691 --> 00:30:58,070
with those little snakebite
tattoos on their cheeks.

325
00:30:58,094 --> 00:30:59,930
Why, you've been busy.

326
00:31:06,237 --> 00:31:10,516
Snakebite Andi,
that's who you are.

327
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,844
So, who am I?

328
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:18,058
You're some crazy bitch
who kidnapped me.

329
00:31:18,082 --> 00:31:19,792
Just the truth from now on.

330
00:31:19,816 --> 00:31:21,920
You will only speak the truth.

331
00:31:24,721 --> 00:31:27,766
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

332
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:31,804
My God. Works a little
too well, don't it?

333
00:31:31,828 --> 00:31:34,808
Here's the deal,
Snakebite Andi.

334
00:31:34,832 --> 00:31:38,544
You're a pusher, hmm?
You can push people.

335
00:31:38,568 --> 00:31:40,880
We haven't had a pusher
around here for a little while,

336
00:31:40,904 --> 00:31:45,709
so I'm gonna offer you a deal I haven't
offered anyone in almost 40 years.

337
00:31:47,277 --> 00:31:49,480
How old are you, darlin'?

338
00:31:50,948 --> 00:31:52,291
Fifteen.

339
00:31:52,315 --> 00:31:54,093
Fifteen?

340
00:31:54,117 --> 00:31:57,297
Oh, God, what an age.

341
00:31:57,321 --> 00:32:00,567
Springtime of your womanhood,
isn't it?

342
00:32:00,591 --> 00:32:03,570
Mm. You're not a girl anymore,

343
00:32:03,594 --> 00:32:07,273
but you don't have
a single dent yet either.

344
00:32:07,297 --> 00:32:09,834
Gravity hasn't even
noticed you.

345
00:32:10,601 --> 00:32:12,003
Not at 15.

346
00:32:13,703 --> 00:32:14,838
Men, though...

347
00:32:16,273 --> 00:32:17,775
No, no, no. No shame.

348
00:32:19,209 --> 00:32:23,822
You paid that back, didn't you?

349
00:32:23,846 --> 00:32:27,293
That's what I'm offering you.
Springtime forever.

350
00:32:27,317 --> 00:32:29,729
Ten years from now,
you're still 15.

351
00:32:29,753 --> 00:32:32,023
A hundred, maybe 17.

352
00:32:33,856 --> 00:32:35,135
Eat well,

353
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:38,963
stay young, live long.

354
00:32:41,864 --> 00:32:44,043
So, you and your friend...

355
00:32:44,067 --> 00:32:47,179
Mm, not my friend.
That's my family.

356
00:32:47,203 --> 00:32:49,640
We're the True Knot, dear.

357
00:32:51,874 --> 00:32:53,919
The True Knot.

358
00:32:53,943 --> 00:32:58,081
What's tied
can never be untied.

359
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:12,989
You like it?

360
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,268
Oh. Sorry. I was just...

361
00:34:15,292 --> 00:34:18,672
That's okay.
People love to look at it.

362
00:34:18,696 --> 00:34:20,674
We used to set this up
in the library.

363
00:34:20,698 --> 00:34:23,942
Community project,
just taking a life all its own.

364
00:34:23,966 --> 00:34:25,944
See, we started with
the clock tower there.

365
00:34:25,968 --> 00:34:28,681
- Oh, yeah.
- Just keeps growing.

366
00:34:28,705 --> 00:34:30,116
Kids call it Teenytown.

367
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,418
The kids build this?

368
00:34:31,442 --> 00:34:33,186
With some help, oh, yeah.

369
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,947
Keep it up,
build the whole town square.

370
00:34:37,948 --> 00:34:42,061
Are you off the bus
or riding your thumb?

371
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:43,395
Yeah, the bus.

372
00:34:43,419 --> 00:34:46,032
Oh. Not many ride the bus
this far north.

373
00:34:46,056 --> 00:34:48,960
Unless they're looking
for work.

374
00:34:51,462 --> 00:34:52,997
Yeah.

375
00:34:54,131 --> 00:34:55,974
Change of scenery,

376
00:34:55,998 --> 00:34:58,669
or you running away
from something?

377
00:35:00,203 --> 00:35:01,980
Oh, don't mind me.
I hope I'm...

378
00:35:02,004 --> 00:35:03,183
New face is all.

379
00:35:03,207 --> 00:35:04,817
Yeah.

380
00:35:04,841 --> 00:35:07,377
Guess I'm running away
from myself, I guess.

381
00:35:08,312 --> 00:35:10,489
Oh, yeah.

382
00:35:10,513 --> 00:35:15,962
I know that look.
Too well, I'm sorry to say.

383
00:35:15,986 --> 00:35:19,833
Running away from yourself.
That is a pickle.

384
00:35:19,857 --> 00:35:22,435
You take yourself
with you wherever you go.

385
00:35:22,459 --> 00:35:26,406
- Ain't that the bitch?
- Mm-hmm.

386
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,907
<i>Rent's 85 a week,</i>

387
00:35:27,931 --> 00:35:29,308
payable up front.

388
00:35:29,332 --> 00:35:32,846
Billy paid your first two,
rest's on you.

389
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:36,482
No pets, no parties, no noise.

390
00:35:36,506 --> 00:35:39,152
I'm a quiet tenant.

391
00:35:39,176 --> 00:35:43,288
Last guy said the same.
Math student.

392
00:35:43,312 --> 00:35:45,190
Even let him paint the wall
all blackboard,

393
00:35:45,214 --> 00:35:48,228
so he could scribble
his little puzzles up there.

394
00:35:48,252 --> 00:35:51,130
Wasn't quiet. No, sir.

395
00:35:51,154 --> 00:35:54,400
Didn't even paint over this when he
left, but I'm glad he didn't,

396
00:35:54,424 --> 00:35:57,003
'cause I can make this
easy for ya,

397
00:35:57,027 --> 00:35:58,996
so you see it every morning
when you wake.

398
00:36:02,332 --> 00:36:04,277
You sure you wanna
vouch for this pup?

399
00:36:04,301 --> 00:36:05,811
Pretty sure.

400
00:36:05,835 --> 00:36:07,071
It's your ass, Billy.

401
00:36:08,138 --> 00:36:10,107
Bleedin' heart, this one.

402
00:36:12,509 --> 00:36:16,054
I'm downstairs, ground floor,
if you need anything.

403
00:36:16,078 --> 00:36:18,815
Find me tomorrow,
talk about some work.

404
00:36:20,149 --> 00:36:22,362
Why are you doing this?

405
00:36:22,386 --> 00:36:23,929
You don't know me.

406
00:36:23,953 --> 00:36:25,931
No, I don't.

407
00:36:25,955 --> 00:36:28,835
But I know the look,
like I said.

408
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:32,272
And sometimes I get this
feeling about people.

409
00:36:32,296 --> 00:36:35,208
- Hard to understand, I guess.
- Mm.

410
00:36:35,232 --> 00:36:37,067
Easier than you think.

411
00:36:38,502 --> 00:36:40,204
- Thanks.
- All right.

412
00:37:01,424 --> 00:37:02,859
You ready?

413
00:37:05,361 --> 00:37:06,564
She's ready.

414
00:37:11,968 --> 00:37:13,413
Who...
Who are these people?

415
00:37:13,437 --> 00:37:16,049
You'll find out after.

416
00:37:16,073 --> 00:37:17,951
That over there
is Grampa Flick...

417
00:37:17,975 --> 00:37:20,011
and he'll lead us. Lie down.

418
00:37:20,509 --> 00:37:21,879
There.

419
00:37:26,283 --> 00:37:30,029
No fear. You understand?

420
00:37:38,328 --> 00:37:40,064
We are the True Knot

421
00:37:40,897 --> 00:37:42,909
and we endure.

422
00:37:45,234 --> 00:37:47,313
We are the chosen ones.

423
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:52,451
We are the fortunate ones.

424
00:37:55,344 --> 00:37:59,584
What is tied cannot be untied.

425
00:38:02,451 --> 00:38:04,321
Here is a woman.

426
00:38:05,221 --> 00:38:06,924
Would she join us?

427
00:38:08,692 --> 00:38:13,397
Would she tie her life
to our life?

428
00:38:13,931 --> 00:38:15,107
Yes.

429
00:38:15,131 --> 00:38:16,541
Yes.

430
00:38:16,565 --> 00:38:18,636
Say yes.

431
00:38:21,038 --> 00:38:22,173
Yes.

432
00:38:23,674 --> 00:38:25,576
This one's special.

433
00:38:26,576 --> 00:38:28,353
Her name's Violet.

434
00:38:28,377 --> 00:38:30,013
There's not much of her left.

435
00:38:31,515 --> 00:38:33,092
And she tastes...

436
00:38:35,185 --> 00:38:37,121
...like flowers.

437
00:38:59,408 --> 00:39:01,186
Breathe deep.

438
00:39:08,085 --> 00:39:11,956
There. Embrace it.

439
00:39:16,026 --> 00:39:17,428
Embrace it.

440
00:39:29,105 --> 00:39:30,105
No!

441
00:39:31,707 --> 00:39:34,721
No! No!

442
00:40:27,163 --> 00:40:29,499
They haven't
found us yet.

443
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:33,645
They were used to
hearing him cry

444
00:40:33,669 --> 00:40:36,239
'cause I left him alone
so much.

445
00:40:38,642 --> 00:40:40,710
So they didn't do anything.

446
00:40:43,779 --> 00:40:46,358
And they haven't found us yet.

447
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:56,026
Mommy?

448
00:41:19,649 --> 00:41:22,128
Oh, hey.

449
00:41:22,152 --> 00:41:25,297
Uh, you said that
you knew my look.

450
00:41:25,321 --> 00:41:27,057
Well, what did you mean?

451
00:41:28,357 --> 00:41:29,526
Brother...

452
00:41:30,794 --> 00:41:32,704
you're sick.

453
00:41:32,728 --> 00:41:34,799
You're tired.
I can see that much.

454
00:41:36,899 --> 00:41:40,270
But you're sick and tired
of being sick and tired.

455
00:41:43,573 --> 00:41:45,276
I need help.

456
00:41:49,379 --> 00:41:50,822
Come on in.

457
00:41:50,846 --> 00:41:52,582
We'll talk about it.

458
00:41:55,484 --> 00:42:00,366
<i>God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,</i>

459
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,601
the courage
to change the things I can,

460
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:05,471
and the wisdom to
know the difference.

461
00:42:05,495 --> 00:42:07,473
Well, Bobbie's got
a big birthday today.

462
00:42:07,497 --> 00:42:08,907
Three years. Three years sober.

463
00:42:08,931 --> 00:42:10,767
Yeah.

464
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:14,846
I'm so proud of you.

465
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,406
Thanks, John.

466
00:42:20,509 --> 00:42:22,654
Now, am I forgetting anybody?

467
00:42:22,678 --> 00:42:25,724
Does anybody got a year?
Or six months?

468
00:42:25,748 --> 00:42:27,726
Well, now for the most
important person in the room.

469
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,587
Is, uh, anybody here a newbie?

470
00:42:32,254 --> 00:42:34,290
Somebody got 24 hours?

471
00:42:37,227 --> 00:42:38,228
Yeah.

472
00:42:45,902 --> 00:42:47,712
<i>New to town, huh?</i>

473
00:42:47,736 --> 00:42:49,848
Yeah, I, uh...

474
00:42:49,872 --> 00:42:51,884
Nothing personal.
I delivered half the people in the room.

475
00:42:51,908 --> 00:42:54,219
- Just new faces pop, that's all.
- This here is Dan Torrance.

476
00:42:54,243 --> 00:42:56,288
- He's fresh off the bus.
- Hey.

477
00:42:56,312 --> 00:42:58,548
Fresh off the ground,
by the look.

478
00:42:59,348 --> 00:43:00,525
Oh.

479
00:43:00,549 --> 00:43:02,261
There's no judgment here,
brother.

480
00:43:02,285 --> 00:43:03,695
I mean, we've all been there.

481
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:05,864
- And worse, trust me.
- Oh, yeah.

482
00:43:05,888 --> 00:43:08,733
Doc, he's served our town
most my life.

483
00:43:08,757 --> 00:43:09,969
Delivered my baby brother.

484
00:43:09,993 --> 00:43:11,695
Yeah.
How is Frankie these days?

485
00:43:13,296 --> 00:43:14,773
Well, he'll find his way back.

486
00:43:14,797 --> 00:43:17,442
You know, he's got a good heart
under it all.

487
00:43:17,466 --> 00:43:21,279
Billy really tried with him.
Well, we all did.

488
00:43:21,303 --> 00:43:23,915
Well, Billy, you know, if you're
looking for a wing to climb under...

489
00:43:23,939 --> 00:43:25,618
...I can't
say you'll do any better

490
00:43:25,642 --> 00:43:27,619
than Billy Freeman here.

491
00:43:27,643 --> 00:43:29,913
Thank you for your hospitality.
I...

492
00:43:31,247 --> 00:43:33,625
I'm a little, uh...

493
00:43:33,649 --> 00:43:35,561
I guess I'm not used to it.

494
00:43:35,585 --> 00:43:37,462
Well, you know we say,

495
00:43:37,486 --> 00:43:38,965
"You can't judge someone till
you know their whole story."

496
00:43:38,989 --> 00:43:40,632
You might think you understand,

497
00:43:40,656 --> 00:43:43,369
- but you don't.
- You don't.

498
00:43:43,393 --> 00:43:44,703
So, how are you today?
All right?

499
00:43:44,727 --> 00:43:45,938
Train's still running.

500
00:43:45,962 --> 00:43:48,273
That's good to hear.

501
00:43:48,297 --> 00:43:49,442
You good?

502
00:43:49,466 --> 00:43:51,777
Yeah. Yeah.

503
00:43:51,801 --> 00:43:52,978
Well, good to know you, Dan.

504
00:43:53,002 --> 00:43:54,380
- Yeah.
- Come again.

505
00:43:54,404 --> 00:43:55,614
- Thanks.
- Hope to see you again soon.

506
00:43:55,638 --> 00:43:58,351
I'll... I'll come back, yeah.

507
00:43:58,375 --> 00:44:00,953
Really good man.
He's got a gift...

508
00:44:00,977 --> 00:44:02,755
Yeah. Hey, Billy, hang on.

509
00:44:02,779 --> 00:44:04,281
Hey, Doc.

510
00:44:06,315 --> 00:44:08,927
Your watch. Uh...

511
00:44:08,951 --> 00:44:12,031
You lost your watch.
You were worried about the kid with, uh...

512
00:44:12,055 --> 00:44:13,757
Goocher's.

513
00:44:15,491 --> 00:44:16,969
What?

514
00:44:16,993 --> 00:44:21,431
The kid with Goocher's or
Gaucher's. The bone thing.

515
00:44:23,899 --> 00:44:25,777
Gaucher's disease.

516
00:44:25,801 --> 00:44:27,512
Right.

517
00:44:27,536 --> 00:44:28,848
You were washing your hands
in the hospital bathroom

518
00:44:28,872 --> 00:44:31,341
and you left it
on the soap dispenser.

519
00:44:33,777 --> 00:44:36,522
Well, just check
on the soap dispenser.

520
00:44:36,546 --> 00:44:38,448
- It's good to meet you.
- Yeah.

521
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:44,955
How did you know?

522
00:44:46,489 --> 00:44:48,559
I wish I could say. Uh...

523
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:51,428
Lucky guess.

524
00:44:54,431 --> 00:44:56,909
My ass.

525
00:44:56,933 --> 00:45:00,738
Intuition, I suppose. Like a
feeling in my gut. Maybe a...

526
00:45:02,372 --> 00:45:04,482
A lucky guess.

527
00:45:04,506 --> 00:45:06,376
What do you wanna do here?

528
00:45:07,643 --> 00:45:08,987
What do you mean?

529
00:45:09,011 --> 00:45:11,881
I mean here in Frazier.
Why are you here?

530
00:45:12,948 --> 00:45:14,427
And don't bullshit me, Dan.

531
00:45:14,451 --> 00:45:17,521
I'm prone to
gut feelings of my own.

532
00:45:18,922 --> 00:45:20,965
I don't know. I don't know.

533
00:45:20,989 --> 00:45:24,395
Something different
than I've been doing.

534
00:45:25,928 --> 00:45:27,764
Something better.

535
00:45:28,931 --> 00:45:31,043
Anything's better, frankly.

536
00:45:31,067 --> 00:45:32,670
You go to church?

537
00:45:33,602 --> 00:45:34,980
Does it matter?

538
00:45:35,004 --> 00:45:37,007
Do you believe in something?
Something...

539
00:45:38,808 --> 00:45:40,444
bigger than you?

540
00:45:42,478 --> 00:45:45,724
Our... Our beliefs
don't make us better people.

541
00:45:45,748 --> 00:45:48,084
Our actions
make us better people.

542
00:45:50,386 --> 00:45:52,864
So, Billy says you have
orderly experience.

543
00:45:52,888 --> 00:45:54,567
That's right.

544
00:45:54,591 --> 00:45:56,134
You workin' right now?

545
00:45:56,158 --> 00:45:59,637
A few shifts at Teenytown.
Helping with the train.

546
00:45:59,661 --> 00:46:03,074
'Cause I do three days a week
at Rivington House, the hospice.

547
00:46:03,098 --> 00:46:05,378
Good orderly is tough to find.

548
00:46:05,402 --> 00:46:06,570
Tougher to keep.

549
00:46:07,971 --> 00:46:10,148
Do dying people bother you?

550
00:46:10,172 --> 00:46:11,916
No.

551
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,518
We're all dying.

552
00:46:13,542 --> 00:46:16,522
The world is one big hospice
with fresh air.

553
00:46:16,546 --> 00:46:17,781
Hmm.

554
00:47:06,129 --> 00:47:07,397
Wow.

555
00:47:08,531 --> 00:47:10,500
Well, hi there.

556
00:47:11,734 --> 00:47:14,705
- How long was I...
- Oh, few days.

557
00:47:15,939 --> 00:47:17,408
You said it didn't hurt.

558
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:22,855
Doesn't now, does it?

559
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,681
- Felt like I was dying.
- Mm.

560
00:47:25,781 --> 00:47:27,125
I know.

561
00:47:27,149 --> 00:47:28,718
You did.

562
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,531
You brought me back.

563
00:47:32,555 --> 00:47:34,500
You'll feel better
when you eat.

564
00:47:34,524 --> 00:47:35,893
Am I still human?

565
00:47:37,527 --> 00:47:39,672
Do you care?

566
00:47:39,696 --> 00:47:42,007
<i>♪ It's all forgotten now ♪</i>

567
00:47:42,031 --> 00:47:44,710
<i>♪ The trouble and the pain ♪</i>

568
00:47:44,734 --> 00:47:47,770
<i>♪ Forgotten,
Every word I said ♪</i>

569
00:47:49,605 --> 00:47:53,185
<i>♪ Forgotten,
Every tear you shed ♪</i>

570
00:47:53,209 --> 00:47:55,846
<i>♪ We're still in love ♪</i>

571
00:47:58,982 --> 00:48:00,117
There you go.

572
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,721
What is it?

573
00:48:07,556 --> 00:48:09,192
You're scared of me.

574
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:11,895
Oh...

575
00:48:13,629 --> 00:48:16,767
We love you more than anything
in the world.

576
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:19,702
You hear me?

577
00:48:21,103 --> 00:48:22,172
Anything.

578
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,042
Goodnight, my heart.

579
00:49:09,752 --> 00:49:12,656
Hey. Let him be.

580
00:49:14,323 --> 00:49:16,292
Azreel, leave him be.

581
00:49:26,602 --> 00:49:28,004
Azzie?

582
00:49:29,172 --> 00:49:30,607
Azzie, come on.

583
00:49:31,707 --> 00:49:34,119
Come on. Azzie.

584
00:49:34,143 --> 00:49:35,279
Doc.

585
00:49:36,379 --> 00:49:38,623
That you, Doc?

586
00:49:38,647 --> 00:49:39,991
No, I'm not a doctor.

587
00:49:40,015 --> 00:49:42,161
Do you want me to
get you a doctor?

588
00:49:42,185 --> 00:49:43,795
The cat's on my bed.

589
00:49:43,819 --> 00:49:45,264
Oh, hey, I'll move her.

590
00:49:45,288 --> 00:49:46,864
No.

591
00:49:46,888 --> 00:49:49,034
I knew she would be.

592
00:49:49,058 --> 00:49:53,237
That cat always
seems to know...

593
00:49:55,064 --> 00:49:56,700
when it's time.

594
00:49:58,334 --> 00:50:00,980
- I guess it's time.
- No.

595
00:50:01,004 --> 00:50:03,715
It's just Azzie
being a silly old cat.

596
00:50:03,739 --> 00:50:05,851
Nope.

597
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:08,245
Been that way
ever since I got here.

598
00:50:09,344 --> 00:50:11,322
The cat knows

599
00:50:11,346 --> 00:50:13,791
when it's time to go to sleep.

600
00:50:13,815 --> 00:50:15,819
Everybody knows that.

601
00:50:17,319 --> 00:50:19,323
I'm gonna die.

602
00:50:30,033 --> 00:50:32,210
Yes.

603
00:50:32,234 --> 00:50:33,311
Let me get you someone.

604
00:50:33,335 --> 00:50:34,738
No.

605
00:50:36,339 --> 00:50:39,276
Known it was comin'.

606
00:50:41,243 --> 00:50:43,688
Doesn't make it less scary.

607
00:50:43,712 --> 00:50:45,123
Yeah.

608
00:50:45,147 --> 00:50:47,358
But maybe
it's just like you say,

609
00:50:47,382 --> 00:50:50,295
just going to sleep.

610
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:53,898
I mean, there's nothing scary.
It's just sleeping.

611
00:50:53,922 --> 00:50:56,301
You're a strange
type of doctor.

612
00:50:56,325 --> 00:50:58,103
I told you, I'm not a doctor.

613
00:50:58,127 --> 00:51:00,063
Oh, I think you are.

614
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:02,907
Doctor Sleep.

615
00:51:02,931 --> 00:51:06,244
Doc, I am so scared
it's gonna hurt, or be dark,

616
00:51:06,268 --> 00:51:09,715
or... or be nothing at all.
And I don't wanna...

617
00:51:09,739 --> 00:51:11,842
<i>Nothing to be scared of.</i>

618
00:51:12,442 --> 00:51:15,453
<i>Just going to sleep.</i>

619
00:51:15,477 --> 00:51:20,149
<i>Finally, true, restful sleep.</i>

620
00:51:24,152 --> 00:51:25,921
Oh, thank you.

621
00:51:27,056 --> 00:51:30,369
Thank you, Doc.

622
00:51:30,393 --> 00:51:33,105
Look, I shouldn't be here.
Let me go get you some...

623
00:51:33,129 --> 00:51:34,373
No, no, no.

624
00:51:34,397 --> 00:51:38,134
You're exactly
where you should be.

625
00:51:40,502 --> 00:51:42,138
Exactly.

626
00:51:46,442 --> 00:51:48,679
I see my wife.

627
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:15,125
Dan, alcoholic.

628
00:54:15,991 --> 00:54:17,335
Hi, Dan.

629
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:19,971
I'm not much of
a speech guy.

630
00:54:19,995 --> 00:54:24,200
I just thought I'd hold the chip
and talk about whatever popped up.

631
00:54:25,935 --> 00:54:27,469
So, here I am.

632
00:54:31,339 --> 00:54:33,509
And I'm thinkin' about my dad.

633
00:54:35,678 --> 00:54:38,657
I saw a chip like this
in his hand once.

634
00:54:38,681 --> 00:54:40,659
A couple months before he died.

635
00:54:40,683 --> 00:54:42,585
Five month chip,
I'm pretty sure.

636
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:49,960
He hurt me once
when he was drunk.

637
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,228
Broke my arm.

638
00:54:53,261 --> 00:54:55,030
Then he dried right out.

639
00:54:58,401 --> 00:55:02,047
He died when I was five, so the
only way I got to know him,

640
00:55:02,071 --> 00:55:06,150
really got to know him,
was when I went dark.

641
00:55:06,174 --> 00:55:09,879
When I...
When I drank to dull the...

642
00:55:10,712 --> 00:55:12,991
or, uh...

643
00:55:13,015 --> 00:55:15,326
whenever I wanted
to break someone's face,

644
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:20,232
'cause the drinking
and the temper and the anger,

645
00:55:20,256 --> 00:55:22,034
those things in me were his.

646
00:55:22,058 --> 00:55:24,060
And they were
all I could know of him.

647
00:55:26,728 --> 00:55:32,411
But now, well, now I get to
know him a little different...

648
00:55:32,435 --> 00:55:36,081
'cause he also stood
in a room like this once...

649
00:55:36,105 --> 00:55:40,543
wanting to get well
for me and my mom.

650
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:44,656
And he held the chip
in his hand

651
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,125
and the chip said five months,

652
00:55:47,149 --> 00:55:49,628
and on that day, he...

653
00:55:49,652 --> 00:55:51,388
Before it all...

654
00:55:53,556 --> 00:55:55,567
Well, on that day,
all he wanted in the world

655
00:55:55,591 --> 00:55:57,928
was to stand
where I'm standing now.

656
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,063
And here I am,

657
00:56:02,497 --> 00:56:05,234
so thank you for us both,
I guess.

658
00:56:06,435 --> 00:56:08,380
This is for Jack Torrance.

659
00:56:27,556 --> 00:56:29,059
Hey, Charlie.

660
00:56:31,694 --> 00:56:32,694
Doc?

661
00:56:35,698 --> 00:56:41,036
Guess I don't need to ask
why you're here at this hour.

662
00:56:43,471 --> 00:56:45,449
Do you have pain?

663
00:56:45,473 --> 00:56:48,243
Do you want me to get Claudette
to bring you a pill?

664
00:56:49,377 --> 00:56:52,357
Pill won't matter.

665
00:56:52,381 --> 00:56:57,061
I heard about
these house calls.

666
00:56:57,085 --> 00:57:02,024
What a visit from Doctor Sleep
really is.

667
00:57:04,527 --> 00:57:06,730
So, what do you see, Doc?

668
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:17,081
I see your twin sons.

669
00:57:17,105 --> 00:57:18,408
Four years old.

670
00:57:19,241 --> 00:57:20,509
Can you see them?

671
00:57:21,544 --> 00:57:22,612
I do.

672
00:57:24,245 --> 00:57:26,391
Farmall tractor.

673
00:57:26,415 --> 00:57:28,585
A striped umbrella
over the seat.

674
00:57:29,618 --> 00:57:31,286
Five years old,

675
00:57:32,221 --> 00:57:34,090
pulling a red wagon.

676
00:57:36,558 --> 00:57:40,072
Lord, look at that.

677
00:57:40,096 --> 00:57:42,306
Like a deck of cards.

678
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:44,066
All out of order.

679
00:57:45,634 --> 00:57:49,539
I'm not scared of hell, Doc.

680
00:57:51,172 --> 00:57:56,387
Uh, I lived a decent life.

681
00:57:56,411 --> 00:57:59,623
I don't think
there is such a place anyway.

682
00:57:59,647 --> 00:58:01,383
I guess I'm scared...

683
00:58:03,252 --> 00:58:04,821
there's nothing.

684
00:58:06,788 --> 00:58:08,825
There was nothing before.

685
00:58:10,893 --> 00:58:16,166
So, what if there's
nothing after?

686
00:58:17,832 --> 00:58:19,768
We don't end, Charlie.

687
00:58:20,803 --> 00:58:23,148
I know that for certain.

688
00:58:23,172 --> 00:58:25,108
I don't know much else...

689
00:58:26,308 --> 00:58:28,645
but I know that we don't end.

690
00:58:33,149 --> 00:58:34,726
Blueberries.

691
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:39,289
I can taste blueberries
my mother used to grow.

692
00:58:40,589 --> 00:58:42,266
Can you taste them?

693
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:46,237
- Yeah, I can.
- Ah.

694
00:58:46,261 --> 00:58:49,241
And I can hear Frank
on your old radio.

695
00:58:49,265 --> 00:58:50,608
The one you used to
have on your workbench

696
00:58:50,632 --> 00:58:52,134
next to your tools.

697
00:58:53,602 --> 00:58:55,913
<i>♪ Come fly with me ♪</i>

698
00:58:55,937 --> 00:58:59,717
<i>♪ Let's fly, let's fly away ♪</i>

699
00:58:59,741 --> 00:59:04,255
<i>♪ If you can

700
00:59:04,279 --> 00:59:08,259

701
00:59:08,283 --> 00:59:10,427

702
00:59:10,451 --> 00:59:13,890

703
00:59:14,857 --> 00:59:16,559
<i>♪ Away ♪</i>

704
00:59:27,236 --> 00:59:29,305
Been a minute, little pen pal.

705
00:59:42,917 --> 00:59:46,655
Abra? School.

706
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:49,926
Fine, I know.

707
01:00:08,277 --> 01:00:10,355
Hey, Gramps, you seen Rosie?

708
01:00:10,379 --> 01:00:12,315
Watchtower.

709
01:00:14,382 --> 01:00:16,393
You feelin' okay?

710
01:00:16,417 --> 01:00:18,496
Peachy keen.

711
01:00:36,672 --> 01:00:38,208
Hey.

712
01:00:39,674 --> 01:00:41,386
Sorry to interrupt.

713
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:43,487
Any luck?

714
01:00:43,511 --> 01:00:45,556
- Gettin' closer.
- Hmm.

715
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:48,493
He's somewhere in Iowa,
I think.

716
01:00:48,517 --> 01:00:52,254
We'll all take a nice long road
trip once I'm sure I've found him.

717
01:00:55,056 --> 01:00:57,335
Until I do, we...

718
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:59,904
You gotta open a canister,
Rosie.

719
01:00:59,928 --> 01:01:03,907
We took steam six months ago,
Crow. Six months is nothing.

720
01:01:03,931 --> 01:01:08,012
That kid in Delaware wasn't so
steamy and it's already showing.

721
01:01:08,036 --> 01:01:09,813
You see Grampa Flick's hair,
yeah?

722
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:11,282
Yeah.

723
01:01:11,306 --> 01:01:12,851
I don't think he's well.

724
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:15,587
Grampa Flick hasn't been well
since Nixon was in office.

725
01:01:15,611 --> 01:01:17,855
I know.

726
01:01:17,879 --> 01:01:20,782
But we need to eat.
All of us.

727
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:24,295
Are the canisters low?

728
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:25,864
'Course not.

729
01:01:25,888 --> 01:01:28,958
Just no need to waste one
if you're close to the kill.

730
01:01:30,759 --> 01:01:32,337
- Rosie.
- Mm-hmm?

731
01:01:32,361 --> 01:01:34,797
I might need it
just to find him.

732
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,378
There used to be more steam
in the world, you know?

733
01:01:40,402 --> 01:01:41,913
Oh, don't be daft. Come on.

734
01:01:41,937 --> 01:01:43,648
That's like when rubes say,

735
01:01:43,672 --> 01:01:45,983
"50 years ago, people used
to be more neighborly."

736
01:01:46,007 --> 01:01:47,719
But it's true, Rosie.

737
01:01:47,743 --> 01:01:49,853
There's less steam out there,
and it's weaker, too.

738
01:01:49,877 --> 01:01:51,656
I don't know if
it's their cell phones or diets

739
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,357
or their Netflix or what,

740
01:01:53,381 --> 01:01:55,460
but I am not picking up
many scents these days,

741
01:01:55,484 --> 01:01:56,994
and the ones that I do, Rosie,
are just not that...

742
01:01:57,018 --> 01:01:59,431
I'll open a canister tonight
to tide everyone over.

743
01:01:59,455 --> 01:02:00,690
Thank you.

744
01:02:06,962 --> 01:02:09,440
- You know it, Rosie.
- I know what?

745
01:02:09,464 --> 01:02:11,476
It's why you're up here
every day.

746
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:14,100
It's why you're always up here no
matter what you tell the others.

747
01:02:14,502 --> 01:02:15,813
The world's not as steamy

748
01:02:15,837 --> 01:02:17,939
and you are looking
for a whale.

749
01:03:06,687 --> 01:03:09,134
Oh, watch this kid.
Number 19.

750
01:03:09,158 --> 01:03:11,034
That kid is a natural.

751
01:03:11,058 --> 01:03:13,003
He hits the ball every time.

752
01:03:13,027 --> 01:03:15,407
Like he can read
the pitcher's mind.

753
01:03:15,431 --> 01:03:17,367
Hmm. Is that right?

754
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,119
See? You watch, one of these
days, one of those talent scouts

755
01:03:28,143 --> 01:03:31,414
is gonna get wind of Brad there.
You watch.

756
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,712
Hey, 19,

757
01:03:55,736 --> 01:03:57,949
just saw your game.

758
01:03:57,973 --> 01:03:59,983
You are ready for the majors.

759
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:01,920
- Well played.
- Thanks.

760
01:04:01,944 --> 01:04:03,721
Hey, you headin' home?

761
01:04:03,745 --> 01:04:06,991
You wanna hop in?
I'll give you a ride.

762
01:04:07,015 --> 01:04:09,127
No, it's real close.

763
01:04:09,151 --> 01:04:10,151
I'm good.

764
01:04:12,888 --> 01:04:14,766
It's okay.

765
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:17,627
We're friends. You wanna hop in.
We'll take you right home.

766
01:04:18,861 --> 01:04:20,596
You can take me right home.

767
01:04:21,663 --> 01:04:23,099
You trust me.

768
01:04:23,899 --> 01:04:25,201
I trust you.

769
01:05:00,201 --> 01:05:02,547
No! No, please! No!

770
01:05:14,116 --> 01:05:16,226
No! Please let me go.

771
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:19,721
Please, I won't tell. Please.
Please!

772
01:05:21,256 --> 01:05:25,536
Number 19.

773
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,038
Kid, you were good.

774
01:05:27,062 --> 01:05:29,031
No!

775
01:05:33,768 --> 01:05:36,114
No, please let me go.

776
01:05:36,138 --> 01:05:39,250
I won't tell.
I won't tell. Please.

777
01:05:39,274 --> 01:05:40,685
It's okay.

778
01:05:40,709 --> 01:05:41,877
Please.

779
01:05:45,212 --> 01:05:46,590
Ah.

780
01:05:50,285 --> 01:05:52,053
Are you gonna hurt me?

781
01:05:52,721 --> 01:05:53,797
Yes.

782
01:05:53,821 --> 01:05:55,590
No!

783
01:05:57,024 --> 01:05:59,337
Pain purifies steam.

784
01:05:59,361 --> 01:06:02,832
Fear, too, so, you understand.

785
01:06:24,886 --> 01:06:27,264
Shh.

786
01:06:49,944 --> 01:06:51,656
Stop!

787
01:07:01,656 --> 01:07:03,792
Stop.

788
01:07:04,826 --> 01:07:06,304
Stop.

789
01:07:06,328 --> 01:07:08,598
Stop!

790
01:07:09,397 --> 01:07:11,200
<i>Stop, monster.</i>

791
01:07:18,105 --> 01:07:19,975
<i>Stop. Stop.</i>

792
01:07:20,875 --> 01:07:22,277
What is it?

793
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:34,398
No! Stop!

794
01:07:40,227 --> 01:07:42,306
- Abra! Abra!
- Hey, hey, hey!

795
01:07:42,330 --> 01:07:44,275
Sweetie. Sweetheart, wake up.
Wake up, sweetheart.

796
01:07:44,299 --> 01:07:45,442
- Abra, wake up!
- Hey, hey, hey.

797
01:07:45,466 --> 01:07:46,768
- Abra! Abra!
- Stop it!

798
01:07:56,143 --> 01:07:57,346
Jesus.

799
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:43,693
Okay.

800
01:08:44,425 --> 01:08:46,027
Okay.

801
01:08:46,961 --> 01:08:48,397
Okay.

802
01:09:36,443 --> 01:09:39,247
Damn. I thought he had another
few minutes in him.

803
01:09:43,251 --> 01:09:45,163
Okay, ready?

804
01:09:58,366 --> 01:10:00,977
They killed him.

805
01:10:01,001 --> 01:10:03,272
They killed him.

806
01:10:07,576 --> 01:10:09,078
It's okay.

807
01:10:36,104 --> 01:10:37,439
We had a looker.

808
01:10:42,277 --> 01:10:43,553
Tonight?

809
01:10:43,577 --> 01:10:45,121
Mm-hmm.

810
01:10:45,145 --> 01:10:46,314
Yeah.

811
01:10:47,081 --> 01:10:49,293
Big steam?

812
01:10:49,317 --> 01:10:51,353
Oh, honey, it was huge.

813
01:10:52,987 --> 01:10:54,264
Where?

814
01:10:54,288 --> 01:10:57,225
East Coast, I think.

815
01:10:59,294 --> 01:11:03,398
You're saying someone looked in
from 1,500 miles away?

816
01:11:04,933 --> 01:11:06,402
Maybe further.

817
01:11:08,336 --> 01:11:09,880
Boy or girl?

818
01:11:09,904 --> 01:11:11,615
Girl, I think.

819
01:11:11,639 --> 01:11:15,018
She was out of there so fast.

820
01:11:15,042 --> 01:11:17,922
But I swear, Crow Daddy,

821
01:11:17,946 --> 01:11:21,459
I haven't felt power like that,

822
01:11:21,483 --> 01:11:24,019
raw power like that

823
01:11:25,019 --> 01:11:27,597
in so long.

824
01:11:27,621 --> 01:11:29,901
Then we need to look into it.

825
01:11:29,925 --> 01:11:32,003
- Sooner the better.
- Yeah.

826
01:11:32,027 --> 01:11:33,603
Case her parents
freak out,

827
01:11:33,627 --> 01:11:36,173
send her to a psychiatrist.

828
01:11:36,197 --> 01:11:39,343
You know, they get her on
pills, could ruin the steam.

829
01:11:39,367 --> 01:11:40,477
Might muffle her just...

830
01:11:40,501 --> 01:11:42,346
No, giving Paxil to this kid,

831
01:11:42,370 --> 01:11:46,017
it's like throwing a piece of
Saran Wrap over a searchlight.

832
01:11:46,041 --> 01:11:48,052
I don't know where she is,

833
01:11:48,076 --> 01:11:50,645
but when she comes back,
and she'll be back,

834
01:11:52,147 --> 01:11:54,250
oh, I'll be ready, honey.

835
01:11:56,651 --> 01:11:58,319
I'll be ready.

836
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:01,025
Morning.

837
01:13:01,049 --> 01:13:02,151
Morning.

838
01:13:03,684 --> 01:13:05,029
Guess what.

839
01:13:05,053 --> 01:13:07,030
I made a new friend.

840
01:13:07,054 --> 01:13:08,699
His name's Dan.

841
01:13:08,723 --> 01:13:10,658
Yeah? At school?

842
01:13:11,626 --> 01:13:13,737
No. He doesn't live here.

843
01:13:13,761 --> 01:13:15,638
I mean, he lives close.

844
01:13:15,662 --> 01:13:17,107
Frazier, I think.

845
01:13:17,131 --> 01:13:18,541
No big deal.

846
01:13:18,565 --> 01:13:20,678
Abs, are you okay?

847
01:13:20,702 --> 01:13:22,146
Last night, I...

848
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:24,181
I'm okay.

849
01:13:24,205 --> 01:13:25,715
Sorry about that.

850
01:13:25,739 --> 01:13:29,020
I know that head of yours
is like a radio sometimes.

851
01:13:29,044 --> 01:13:33,057
And you pick up
some weird stations.

852
01:13:33,081 --> 01:13:34,116
Nothing weird like that.

853
01:13:35,183 --> 01:13:36,585
Not anymore.

854
01:13:46,094 --> 01:13:47,571
<i>My God.</i>

855
01:13:47,595 --> 01:13:50,173
<i>I've gotta study.
If I don't study...</i>

856
01:13:50,197 --> 01:13:53,710
<i>Running play.
Hand-off to 11 and...</i>

857
01:13:53,734 --> 01:13:55,737
<i>Coach is gonna kill me
if I don't get these.</i>

858
01:13:57,237 --> 01:13:59,249
<i>Why doesn't he like me?</i>

859
01:13:59,273 --> 01:14:01,185
<i>My hair?
I should change my hair.</i>

860
01:14:01,209 --> 01:14:02,753
<i>The freak
is staring at me again.</i>

861
01:14:02,777 --> 01:14:04,621
<i>What is she staring at?</i>

862
01:14:04,645 --> 01:14:05,645
<i>Freak.</i>

863
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:46,597
Hey, Abba-doo.

864
01:14:46,621 --> 01:14:47,798
Hey, Dad.

865
01:14:47,822 --> 01:14:49,425
School okay?

866
01:14:50,358 --> 01:14:51,768
How's the book?

867
01:14:51,792 --> 01:14:53,736
Good. Yeah, going good.

868
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,806
I'm writing about
Charleston and Black Bottom.

869
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:57,708
Yeah, it's...

870
01:14:57,732 --> 01:15:00,377
- It's feeling like...
- I'm going to start my homework.

871
01:15:00,401 --> 01:15:04,147
Okay. Good.
That's good, sweetie.

872
01:15:04,171 --> 01:15:06,282
Think Harvard in three years.

873
01:15:06,306 --> 01:15:07,517
We'll see.

874
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:09,343
Yeah. We will see.

875
01:18:09,857 --> 01:18:11,334
<i>Thanks so much</i>

876
01:18:11,358 --> 01:18:12,969
<i>for shopping with us today.</i>

877
01:18:12,993 --> 01:18:15,663
<i>And remember, we're always
fresh, just for you.</i>

878
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:47,328
Well, hi there.

879
01:18:54,402 --> 01:18:55,770
Get out!

880
01:18:57,839 --> 01:18:59,707
Get out! Get out of my head!

881
01:19:01,608 --> 01:19:02,710
Get out!

882
01:19:12,153 --> 01:19:14,932
- Ma'am, are you okay?
- No! No.

883
01:19:14,956 --> 01:19:16,692
Yeah, I'm fine.

884
01:19:17,825 --> 01:19:19,402
I'm fine.

885
01:19:26,067 --> 01:19:27,769
Jesus.

886
01:19:28,769 --> 01:19:30,646
Danno?

887
01:19:30,670 --> 01:19:31,981
Dan? Dan?

888
01:19:32,005 --> 01:19:34,485
Get up. Stand up, Dan.

889
01:19:34,509 --> 01:19:35,711
Come on, Danno.

890
01:19:37,412 --> 01:19:39,690
- What happened?
- Well, you just dropped.

891
01:19:39,714 --> 01:19:42,451
Thought you was having a stroke.
Who's Tony?

892
01:19:43,917 --> 01:19:45,495
What?

893
01:19:45,519 --> 01:19:47,079
You kept saying,
"Please help me, Tony."

894
01:19:47,921 --> 01:19:50,032
Oh.

895
01:19:50,056 --> 01:19:52,861
Well, I'm sorry about that.

896
01:20:12,045 --> 01:20:14,014
Rosie?

897
01:20:25,593 --> 01:20:26,770
We've got a problem.

898
01:20:26,794 --> 01:20:29,005
- Talk to me.
- The looker?

899
01:20:29,029 --> 01:20:31,141
Yeah, she found me again.

900
01:20:31,165 --> 01:20:32,676
- How?
- I don't know.

901
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:34,076
I don't care.

902
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:37,681
We have to have her, Crow.
We have to.

903
01:20:37,705 --> 01:20:39,849
Does she know who you are?
Where we are?

904
01:20:39,873 --> 01:20:44,021
No, I don't know. I don't think...
That's not the important... Look.

905
01:20:44,045 --> 01:20:46,589
- I said she's huge steam, right?
- Mm-hmm.

906
01:20:46,613 --> 01:20:48,892
Yeah, it's even bigger
than that.

907
01:20:48,916 --> 01:20:50,593
I tried to turn around in her

908
01:20:50,617 --> 01:20:53,696
and she blew me out of her
like I was nothing.

909
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:56,599
- Bullshit.
- No. Never happened to me, ever.

910
01:20:56,623 --> 01:20:58,426
I would have said
that was impossible.

911
01:21:00,193 --> 01:21:02,196
Is she food
or do we turn her?

912
01:21:03,230 --> 01:21:04,874
We don't turn her.

913
01:21:04,898 --> 01:21:06,477
Rosie, are you sure?

914
01:21:06,501 --> 01:21:07,977
If she's what you say she is,
then...

915
01:21:08,001 --> 01:21:11,013
Then we don't want anyone
with that power in the Knot.

916
01:21:11,037 --> 01:21:13,007
Jeez. Think about it.

917
01:21:20,081 --> 01:21:21,550
What if she's neither?

918
01:21:22,215 --> 01:21:23,526
What do you mean?

919
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:26,029
I mean, we don't kill her.

920
01:21:26,053 --> 01:21:27,823
And we don't turn her.

921
01:21:29,189 --> 01:21:30,868
Think of a cow.

922
01:21:30,892 --> 01:21:33,595
You butcher one, that gives you
meat for a month.

923
01:21:34,961 --> 01:21:36,764
Keep it alive,

924
01:21:37,697 --> 01:21:39,910
take care of it,

925
01:21:39,934 --> 01:21:42,779
it gives you milk for years.

926
01:21:42,803 --> 01:21:44,882
- Rosie, we've never tried that.
- I know.

927
01:21:44,906 --> 01:21:46,883
Because a steam head is
dangerous.

928
01:21:46,907 --> 01:21:48,584
You keep it alive,
it could be dangerous.

929
01:21:48,608 --> 01:21:51,154
I know. The point...

930
01:21:51,178 --> 01:21:53,757
The point, Crow,

931
01:21:53,781 --> 01:21:55,951
is she's the great white whale.

932
01:21:56,951 --> 01:21:58,553
And I want her.

933
01:22:00,254 --> 01:22:01,823
I want her.

934
01:22:03,224 --> 01:22:05,227
I fucking want her.

935
01:22:16,136 --> 01:22:17,681
Have a great day.

936
01:22:17,705 --> 01:22:18,873
You, too.

937
01:23:46,093 --> 01:23:47,796
<i>Hi.</i>

938
01:23:57,971 --> 01:23:59,239
Billy.

939
01:24:17,457 --> 01:24:19,236
<i>You can hear me.</i>

940
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:21,796
Let's use our outside voices,
all right?

941
01:24:23,029 --> 01:24:24,807
You tracked me down?

942
01:24:24,831 --> 01:24:29,413
It was easier than I thought.
Like GPS, but in my head.

943
01:24:29,437 --> 01:24:34,718
Look, I don't mean any offense,
but this day and age, a grown man

944
01:24:34,742 --> 01:24:36,687
sitting with a teenage girl
on a park bench...

945
01:24:36,711 --> 01:24:39,388
I'm Abra Stone. And if anyone
asks, you're my uncle.

946
01:24:39,412 --> 01:24:40,948
Uncle Dan.

947
01:24:43,416 --> 01:24:46,896
And that's not even a lie.
Not totally.

948
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:49,031
We're related in other ways.

949
01:24:49,055 --> 01:24:50,892
You're magic, like me.

950
01:24:52,425 --> 01:24:54,294
I don't know about magic.

951
01:24:55,328 --> 01:24:56,906
I...

952
01:24:56,930 --> 01:24:58,441
I always called it the shining.

953
01:24:58,465 --> 01:25:00,334
And, yeah, we both shine.

954
01:25:01,402 --> 01:25:02,978
Do your parents know?

955
01:25:03,002 --> 01:25:04,706
About my shine?

956
01:25:06,172 --> 01:25:07,483
They're scared of it,

957
01:25:07,507 --> 01:25:10,087
but they think it's gone
except for a few things.

958
01:25:10,111 --> 01:25:13,490
Like, my mom sometimes asks me to
help her find something she's lost.

959
01:25:13,514 --> 01:25:15,392
Last month,
it was her car keys.

960
01:25:15,416 --> 01:25:18,227
She left them on my dad's
worktable in the garage.

961
01:25:18,251 --> 01:25:20,996
But they don't talk about it.

962
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:24,166
Or if I use it,
they look at me different.

963
01:25:24,190 --> 01:25:25,901
Or not at all.

964
01:25:25,925 --> 01:25:28,370
Not for a whole day once.

965
01:25:28,394 --> 01:25:30,264
Wouldn't look me in the eyes.

966
01:25:32,433 --> 01:25:34,745
So, I try not to use it.

967
01:25:34,769 --> 01:25:36,879
Because if people find out,

968
01:25:36,903 --> 01:25:38,339
"Eek, a freak." You know?

969
01:25:40,273 --> 01:25:42,052
Sure you know.

970
01:25:42,076 --> 01:25:44,011
You try not to use it, too.

971
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:49,125
You've been trying a long time,

972
01:25:49,149 --> 01:25:52,386
and she couldn't look you
in your eyes either.

973
01:25:56,523 --> 01:25:58,134
When I was a kid, I didn't

974
01:25:58,158 --> 01:26:01,004
understand the shining.
I called it "Tony."

975
01:26:01,028 --> 01:26:03,339
I thought he was
my imaginary friend.

976
01:26:03,363 --> 01:26:06,409
I thought you were
my imaginary friend...

977
01:26:06,433 --> 01:26:08,502
for a long time.

978
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:13,316
How many of us are out there?

979
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:15,317
There's a lot of people
who have a little bit of shine,

980
01:26:15,341 --> 01:26:16,953
they don't even know it.

981
01:26:16,977 --> 01:26:18,288
They always seem to come home

982
01:26:18,312 --> 01:26:20,123
with flowers
when their wives are sad,

983
01:26:20,147 --> 01:26:22,424
or they do well on the school
test they didn't study for.

984
01:26:22,448 --> 01:26:24,294
But I only met
two or three people

985
01:26:24,318 --> 01:26:26,521
in my whole life
who knew they shined.

986
01:26:29,122 --> 01:26:31,233
The baseball boy shined.

987
01:26:31,257 --> 01:26:33,161
His name was Bradley Trevor.

988
01:26:36,330 --> 01:26:38,474
These people...

989
01:26:38,498 --> 01:26:41,301
they look like people anyway,
they took him.

990
01:26:42,368 --> 01:26:44,371
And they ate him.

991
01:26:45,505 --> 01:26:47,374
They ate his shine.

992
01:26:48,274 --> 01:26:50,853
You could feel it?

993
01:26:50,877 --> 01:26:53,289
And they could feel me,
I think.

994
01:26:53,313 --> 01:26:55,849
At least one of them did.
A lady.

995
01:26:57,283 --> 01:26:58,952
The lady with the hat.

996
01:27:00,287 --> 01:27:03,465
I wanna find them, stop them,

997
01:27:03,489 --> 01:27:07,504
because I think they've done
this to a lot of other kids, too.

998
01:27:07,528 --> 01:27:09,964
So, I have to do something,
right?

999
01:27:10,930 --> 01:27:13,108
Why did you come here?

1000
01:27:13,132 --> 01:27:14,544
Why me?

1001
01:27:14,568 --> 01:27:16,279
Because you can hear me.

1002
01:27:16,303 --> 01:27:19,048
You'd believe me.
You shine, too.

1003
01:27:19,072 --> 01:27:20,874
And they hurt people like us.

1004
01:27:23,109 --> 01:27:24,545
I mean, what would you do?

1005
01:27:28,014 --> 01:27:29,226
If you could get
something of his,

1006
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:30,560
if you could go to Iowa...

1007
01:27:30,584 --> 01:27:32,361
- Whoa, hang on.
- I can help you find him.

1008
01:27:32,385 --> 01:27:34,196
Then his parents would know
where he was.

1009
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:36,199
They could bury him right,
at least.

1010
01:27:36,223 --> 01:27:38,334
We could also get his glove.

1011
01:27:38,358 --> 01:27:40,102
If I can touch that glove,
I can track them.

1012
01:27:40,126 --> 01:27:41,538
Easy. Easy.

1013
01:27:41,562 --> 01:27:44,206
Because Barry the Chunk,
I think that was his name,

1014
01:27:44,230 --> 01:27:46,375
for a while,
before they killed him,

1015
01:27:46,399 --> 01:27:48,169
he was wearing it.

1016
01:27:59,612 --> 01:28:02,424
Abra, go home.

1017
01:28:02,448 --> 01:28:05,361
Think about your school.
Think about your parents.

1018
01:28:05,385 --> 01:28:07,364
Think about
the rest of your life.

1019
01:28:07,388 --> 01:28:09,465
Don't chase these people.

1020
01:28:09,489 --> 01:28:11,401
Don't aggravate them.

1021
01:28:11,425 --> 01:28:14,471
And whatever you do,
don't attract their attention.

1022
01:28:14,495 --> 01:28:16,306
Don't shine.

1023
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:18,040
Find something, anything...

1024
01:28:18,064 --> 01:28:21,977
Well, almost anything,
to stop that shine of yours.

1025
01:28:22,001 --> 01:28:24,647
Keep your head down, keep your
shine down and hope to God

1026
01:28:24,671 --> 01:28:27,316
that these people
or anything like them,

1027
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:30,253
that they don't see you.

1028
01:28:30,277 --> 01:28:32,955
If they see you,
they come back.

1029
01:28:32,979 --> 01:28:34,482
Abra, do you hear me?

1030
01:28:35,581 --> 01:28:37,285
They come back.

1031
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:42,189
Keep your head down. Stay safe.

1032
01:28:44,058 --> 01:28:45,560
I'm sorry.

1033
01:28:58,538 --> 01:29:00,282
<i>Things were tough that year.</i>

1034
01:29:00,306 --> 01:29:02,109
<i>A lot of actors
were out of work.</i>

1035
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:06,155
<i>Hey, fellas.</i>

1036
01:29:06,179 --> 01:29:06,956
<i>Here comes Elmer Fudd
that big vaudeville star.</i>

1037
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:08,490
What is it?

1038
01:29:08,514 --> 01:29:10,183
Oh, it's nothing, Doc.

1039
01:29:11,018 --> 01:29:12,696
It's nothing.

1040
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:14,389
Thinking about Dad.

1041
01:29:17,657 --> 01:29:18,959
No, I'm not.

1042
01:29:20,227 --> 01:29:22,229
You are. And you don't want to.

1043
01:29:27,334 --> 01:29:29,170
Don't worry about me, Doc.

1044
01:29:29,670 --> 01:29:30,670
I'm fine.

1045
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:34,942
We're fine.

1046
01:30:12,578 --> 01:30:14,448
Hey, Azzie.

1047
01:30:27,161 --> 01:30:29,438
You got your wires crossed
tonight.

1048
01:30:32,099 --> 01:30:33,634
That room's empty, Az.

1049
01:30:38,371 --> 01:30:40,575
There's no one in that room.

1050
01:30:48,614 --> 01:30:51,251
Whoa! Hang on, Doc.

1051
01:30:52,152 --> 01:30:53,152
Dick.

1052
01:30:54,321 --> 01:30:56,231
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1053
01:30:56,255 --> 01:30:57,534
I... I... I thought it was...

1054
01:30:57,558 --> 01:30:59,468
Thought I was
from the Overlook.

1055
01:30:59,492 --> 01:31:01,638
Almost locked me up.

1056
01:31:01,662 --> 01:31:04,339
Still getting visits
from them old ghosts?

1057
01:31:04,363 --> 01:31:06,209
No, not for years.

1058
01:31:06,233 --> 01:31:09,512
Horace Derwent was the last
one, confetti on his suit.

1059
01:31:09,536 --> 01:31:11,548
Said, "Great party, isn't it?"

1060
01:31:11,572 --> 01:31:14,851
Shit-eating grin on his face
till I pulled out a box for him.

1061
01:31:14,875 --> 01:31:17,654
That grin went fast.

1062
01:31:17,678 --> 01:31:20,423
Hey, it never occurred to me
to ask you back then.

1063
01:31:20,447 --> 01:31:22,258
What happens to them
in those boxes?

1064
01:31:22,282 --> 01:31:23,625
Do they die in there?

1065
01:31:23,649 --> 01:31:25,053
Do you care?

1066
01:31:29,288 --> 01:31:30,499
I missed you.

1067
01:31:30,523 --> 01:31:31,691
Has it been a long time?

1068
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:35,504
Can't tell.

1069
01:31:35,528 --> 01:31:39,508
This world is a dream
of a dream to me now.

1070
01:31:39,532 --> 01:31:42,245
Eight years. Little more.

1071
01:31:42,269 --> 01:31:44,313
Last time I saw you,

1072
01:31:44,337 --> 01:31:46,206
you was at the bottom.

1073
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,352
You look better now.

1074
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:51,521
Why are you here?

1075
01:31:51,545 --> 01:31:54,215
I'm here because
it all comes 'round.

1076
01:31:55,181 --> 01:31:56,818
Ka's a wheel, Doc.

1077
01:31:59,153 --> 01:32:00,530
You listen, son.

1078
01:32:00,554 --> 01:32:03,633
It hurts to be here,
so I'll only say it once.

1079
01:32:03,657 --> 01:32:07,137
These empty devils
ever found you

1080
01:32:07,161 --> 01:32:08,771
when you was a tyke,

1081
01:32:08,795 --> 01:32:11,273
if they'd even sniffed you,

1082
01:32:11,297 --> 01:32:13,243
you'd be long dead.

1083
01:32:13,267 --> 01:32:18,213
They're on the land
like a cancer on the skin.

1084
01:32:18,237 --> 01:32:20,782
Once, they rode camels
in the desert.

1085
01:32:20,806 --> 01:32:24,411
Once, they drove caravans
across Eastern Europe.

1086
01:32:25,345 --> 01:32:27,589
They eat screams,

1087
01:32:27,613 --> 01:32:30,226
and drink pain,

1088
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:32,886
and they've noticed
that little girl.

1089
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:35,555
They might kill her,

1090
01:32:37,256 --> 01:32:38,492
might turn her,

1091
01:32:40,394 --> 01:32:43,272
or might keep her
till she's all used up,

1092
01:32:43,296 --> 01:32:44,706
and that'd be worst of all.

1093
01:32:44,730 --> 01:32:46,567
You can't let 'em.

1094
01:32:49,236 --> 01:32:50,914
Why me?

1095
01:32:50,938 --> 01:32:53,348
Because she found you.

1096
01:32:53,372 --> 01:32:56,886
Because she showed up.
Hell, Doc, why me?

1097
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:59,422
You just walked on
into my kitchen one day,

1098
01:32:59,446 --> 01:33:00,789
and I'm still on the hook.

1099
01:33:00,813 --> 01:33:02,649
What the hell
am I supposed to do?

1100
01:33:04,885 --> 01:33:07,355
Get her what she asked for.

1101
01:33:09,590 --> 01:33:11,692
You won't see me again, Doc.

1102
01:33:12,693 --> 01:33:14,662
This is my last dream.

1103
01:33:20,901 --> 01:33:24,746
It seems to me
you grew up fine, son,

1104
01:33:24,770 --> 01:33:26,541
but you still owe a debt.

1105
01:33:31,644 --> 01:33:32,846
Pay it.

1106
01:33:46,827 --> 01:33:48,729
God, damn it. What?

1107
01:33:51,732 --> 01:33:53,610
Hey. Sorry to interrupt.

1108
01:33:53,634 --> 01:33:56,478
I told you, "no distractions."
Didn't I?

1109
01:33:56,502 --> 01:33:58,447
Nothing to eat,
nothing to drink.

1110
01:33:58,471 --> 01:34:01,683
Just peace, quiet,
and meditation.

1111
01:34:01,707 --> 01:34:05,521
I need all my wits
for her tonight, Crow.

1112
01:34:05,545 --> 01:34:07,915
That's why I'm here.
I found something.

1113
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:18,834
"How small
can an earthquake be?

1114
01:34:18,858 --> 01:34:21,571
Pretty small, if the people
of Richland Court,

1115
01:34:21,595 --> 01:34:26,308
a short Anniston street that dead-ends
at the Saco River, are to be believed.

1116
01:34:26,332 --> 01:34:27,776
Late Tuesday night,

1117
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:29,745
several residents of the street
reported a tremor

1118
01:34:29,769 --> 01:34:31,647
that rattled windows,
shook floors,

1119
01:34:31,671 --> 01:34:35,418
and sent glassware tumbling
from the shelves.

1120
01:34:35,442 --> 01:34:39,422
Although the Geological Survey
Center in Wrentham

1121
01:34:39,446 --> 01:34:42,515
reports there were no temblors
in New England last Tuesday."

1122
01:34:43,582 --> 01:34:44,826
What do you think?

1123
01:34:44,850 --> 01:34:46,829
I think, maybe.

1124
01:34:46,853 --> 01:34:51,034
I'm not a hundred percent,
but I'll take fifty-fifty.

1125
01:34:51,058 --> 01:34:52,368
If that's actually her...

1126
01:34:52,392 --> 01:34:53,902
Richland Court.

1127
01:34:53,926 --> 01:34:55,972
She did that, shook a whole
street in New Hampshire...

1128
01:34:55,996 --> 01:34:58,775
Having a place to actually focus
on, not just a town, but a street,

1129
01:34:58,799 --> 01:35:01,801
is gonna make things a hell of
a lot easier for me tonight.

1130
01:35:02,769 --> 01:35:03,971
Good catch.

1131
01:35:10,544 --> 01:35:11,912
How you coming at her?

1132
01:35:14,014 --> 01:35:15,583
Well, she'll be asleep.

1133
01:35:17,017 --> 01:35:20,963
I'll just wanna look around,
see if she is.

1134
01:35:20,987 --> 01:35:24,392
Plant some suggestions,
like little worms.

1135
01:35:25,492 --> 01:35:28,036
Let them burrow.

1136
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:31,765
A hundred worms about
her dear friends, the Knot.

1137
01:35:33,099 --> 01:35:35,544
And when we roll up,

1138
01:35:35,568 --> 01:35:39,572
she'll be so happy to see us,
she'll just hop right in the van.

1139
01:35:43,844 --> 01:35:46,088
- If she did this...
- Mm-hmm?

1140
01:35:46,112 --> 01:35:48,790
...really shook a whole street,

1141
01:35:48,814 --> 01:35:51,093
I think you should be careful.

1142
01:35:51,117 --> 01:35:52,819
She's a little girl.

1143
01:35:58,524 --> 01:36:00,902
And you are the queen bitch
of all time.

1144
01:36:00,926 --> 01:36:02,804
- Mm.
- I know.

1145
01:36:02,828 --> 01:36:05,040
Just saying.

1146
01:36:05,064 --> 01:36:07,401
- Be careful.
- Mm.

1147
01:36:25,050 --> 01:36:26,629
Mm.

1148
01:36:31,892 --> 01:36:32,834
Hey.

1149
01:36:32,858 --> 01:36:33,835
Hey, Mom.

1150
01:36:33,859 --> 01:36:35,071
You feeling okay?

1151
01:36:35,095 --> 01:36:36,597
We missed you at dinner.

1152
01:36:37,531 --> 01:36:40,134
I'm okay. Just had a rough day.

1153
01:36:44,938 --> 01:36:47,717
I'm flying out to see Momo
in the morning.

1154
01:36:47,741 --> 01:36:49,143
I'll be back as soon as I can.

1155
01:36:51,577 --> 01:36:52,812
Abs, is she...

1156
01:36:56,849 --> 01:36:58,486
Is she gonna
pull through this time?

1157
01:37:03,023 --> 01:37:04,024
I don't know.

1158
01:37:05,692 --> 01:37:06,794
I hope so.

1159
01:37:07,928 --> 01:37:09,397
Tell her I love her.

1160
01:39:52,626 --> 01:39:54,828
Keep sleeping, princess.

1161
01:40:08,642 --> 01:40:11,754
You rubes.

1162
01:40:11,778 --> 01:40:15,156
Spend your whole lives
making little boxes,

1163
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:17,994
little memories.

1164
01:40:18,018 --> 01:40:21,097
Oh, you think
they make you so rich.

1165
01:40:21,121 --> 01:40:23,157
You should see mine, kiddo.

1166
01:40:24,357 --> 01:40:27,595
Oh, my mind's a cathedral.

1167
01:40:31,665 --> 01:40:34,134
Well, hi there.

1168
01:40:41,875 --> 01:40:42,875
Hmm.

1169
01:40:58,291 --> 01:40:59,627
He said you'd come back.

1170
01:41:01,394 --> 01:41:02,405
And you did.

1171
01:41:04,430 --> 01:41:05,874
Good.

1172
01:41:05,898 --> 01:41:08,143
No!

1173
01:41:08,167 --> 01:41:11,446
Get back! Get back!

1174
01:41:11,470 --> 01:41:14,241
You're just
a fucking child!

1175
01:41:19,712 --> 01:41:21,123
Where are you?

1176
01:41:21,147 --> 01:41:23,392
Where? Where did you...?
Where...?

1177
01:41:23,416 --> 01:41:25,352
What did you...?
Where did you...?

1178
01:41:27,086 --> 01:41:28,086
No.

1179
01:41:30,223 --> 01:41:32,034
Get out! Get out!

1180
01:41:32,058 --> 01:41:33,235
<i>Get out!</i>

1181
01:42:18,971 --> 01:42:20,048
Rose?

1182
01:42:20,072 --> 01:42:21,450
Trap.

1183
01:42:21,474 --> 01:42:23,119
Trap.

1184
01:42:23,143 --> 01:42:25,053
What the hell happened?

1185
01:42:25,077 --> 01:42:27,388
- Little bitch set a trap for me.
- Oh, my God. Your hand.

1186
01:42:27,412 --> 01:42:29,224
Rose! Rose, calm down.

1187
01:42:29,248 --> 01:42:31,459
We know where she is now, right?
Now we know.

1188
01:42:31,483 --> 01:42:32,995
She was in my head!

1189
01:42:33,019 --> 01:42:34,429
- What?
- Stealing!

1190
01:42:34,453 --> 01:42:35,530
What does she know?

1191
01:42:35,554 --> 01:42:37,133
I don't know. I don't know.

1192
01:42:37,157 --> 01:42:39,435
- How much does she...
- I don't know!

1193
01:42:39,459 --> 01:42:42,004
- I don't know...
- There's a problem.

1194
01:42:42,028 --> 01:42:43,004
Not now!

1195
01:42:43,028 --> 01:42:44,098
Grampa Flick...

1196
01:42:45,130 --> 01:42:46,899
I think he's cycling.

1197
01:42:52,304 --> 01:42:55,183
<i>Uncle Dan! Uncle Dan,
I hurt her.</i>

1198
01:42:55,207 --> 01:42:56,218
<i>I really hurt her.</i>

1199
01:42:56,242 --> 01:42:57,986
I hurt her and she deserved it

1200
01:42:58,010 --> 01:43:00,088
and that's not the best part.
The best part is...

1201
01:43:00,112 --> 01:43:03,191
<i>The best part is I got in her head.
I got in her head.</i>

1202
01:43:03,215 --> 01:43:05,326
- <i>Uncle Dan? Are you there?</i>
- Oh, God, Abra.

1203
01:43:05,350 --> 01:43:06,529
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1204
01:43:06,553 --> 01:43:07,955
What have you done?

1205
01:43:24,037 --> 01:43:26,581
Just talk to the kid.

1206
01:43:26,605 --> 01:43:29,108
If we're gonna do this,
then let's do this.

1207
01:43:32,412 --> 01:43:33,514
<i>Hi, Abra.</i>

1208
01:43:37,483 --> 01:43:38,986
I can hear you.

1209
01:43:43,255 --> 01:43:45,233
I don't understand.

1210
01:43:45,257 --> 01:43:46,359
You will.

1211
01:43:48,228 --> 01:43:51,206
I thought we lived forever.

1212
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:53,942
Did someone promise you that,
Andi?

1213
01:43:53,966 --> 01:43:56,269
Did someone say
you're immortal?

1214
01:43:57,437 --> 01:44:02,383
I said, "Live long, eat well."

1215
01:44:02,407 --> 01:44:04,386
We can live long, very long.

1216
01:44:04,410 --> 01:44:05,521
And we do,

1217
01:44:05,545 --> 01:44:07,322
most of us.

1218
01:44:07,346 --> 01:44:09,315
But we haven't been
eating well.

1219
01:44:10,550 --> 01:44:12,820
Not for a long time.

1220
01:44:13,653 --> 01:44:14,955
Rosie, he's going.

1221
01:44:16,589 --> 01:44:17,890
Rosie.

1222
01:44:23,662 --> 01:44:25,131
Yes, love?

1223
01:44:26,398 --> 01:44:28,177
I'm scared.

1224
01:44:28,201 --> 01:44:31,246
No, you're not.

1225
01:44:31,270 --> 01:44:36,352
You watched empires rise and
fall.

1226
01:44:36,376 --> 01:44:39,154
Cheered the gladiators in Rome.

1227
01:44:39,178 --> 01:44:41,190
Sailed across oceans,

1228
01:44:41,214 --> 01:44:43,424
to new worlds,

1229
01:44:43,448 --> 01:44:49,565
while you fed on kings,
and princes, and popes.

1230
01:44:49,589 --> 01:44:52,267
They wrote myths of you,

1231
01:44:52,291 --> 01:44:54,602
and made statues,

1232
01:44:54,626 --> 01:44:59,441
and they trembled
in their villages, and beds,

1233
01:44:59,465 --> 01:45:01,635
and skyscrapers.

1234
01:45:03,236 --> 01:45:05,647
So, no...

1235
01:45:05,671 --> 01:45:08,308
...you're not scared.

1236
01:45:10,209 --> 01:45:11,612
You're a king...

1237
01:45:13,112 --> 01:45:15,315
and you eat fear.

1238
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:08,576
Hey, bro.

1239
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:09,745
You know, it's 4:00 a.m.

1240
01:46:09,769 --> 01:46:11,981
You've always seen me, Billy.

1241
01:46:12,005 --> 01:46:14,574
You have a good sense about
people, is that fair to say?

1242
01:46:15,407 --> 01:46:16,718
Yeah, what...

1243
01:46:16,742 --> 01:46:18,987
You think I'm an honest man?
A good man?

1244
01:46:19,011 --> 01:46:20,289
I do, I do. Dan, I...

1245
01:46:20,313 --> 01:46:22,090
I need your help.

1246
01:46:22,114 --> 01:46:23,659
The first thing I need is for
you to listen to a story

1247
01:46:23,683 --> 01:46:26,386
and try harder than you've ever
tried to believe me.

1248
01:46:43,435 --> 01:46:44,571
How's it going?

1249
01:46:45,772 --> 01:46:47,249
Oh, hey.

1250
01:46:47,273 --> 01:46:48,517
Shouldn't you be
getting ready for school?

1251
01:46:48,541 --> 01:46:51,352
Yeah, but I wanted
to tag along.

1252
01:46:51,376 --> 01:46:52,620
How long have you been driving?

1253
01:46:52,644 --> 01:46:54,389
A few hours or so.

1254
01:46:54,413 --> 01:46:56,148
We should get there tonight.
Late.

1255
01:46:58,584 --> 01:47:00,329
Who's that?

1256
01:47:00,353 --> 01:47:01,688
He's my friend.

1257
01:47:02,654 --> 01:47:04,291
Maybe my best friend.

1258
01:47:05,657 --> 01:47:07,636
You should've seen her face.

1259
01:47:07,660 --> 01:47:09,705
She was scared, Uncle Dan.

1260
01:47:09,729 --> 01:47:11,606
Scared like all those kids
were scared.

1261
01:47:11,630 --> 01:47:13,409
All those kids she's killed.

1262
01:47:13,433 --> 01:47:16,512
She was so mad
and so scared that I got in.

1263
01:47:16,536 --> 01:47:18,112
That was a new trick.

1264
01:47:18,136 --> 01:47:19,647
I've never done that before.

1265
01:47:19,671 --> 01:47:21,607
Yeah, me neither.
What was it like?

1266
01:47:22,474 --> 01:47:24,053
Like a library.

1267
01:47:24,077 --> 01:47:26,313
I guess
we're all libraries inside.

1268
01:47:27,246 --> 01:47:28,690
How'd you do it?

1269
01:47:28,714 --> 01:47:31,093
Like this. Just a little push.

1270
01:47:36,288 --> 01:47:37,732
Abra!

1271
01:47:37,756 --> 01:47:39,593
Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry!

1272
01:47:44,529 --> 01:47:46,209
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
- It's okay.

1273
01:47:47,666 --> 01:47:49,611
What were all those boxes?

1274
01:47:49,635 --> 01:47:50,745
Nothing.

1275
01:47:50,769 --> 01:47:52,138
Liar.

1276
01:47:55,241 --> 01:47:57,518
When I was a kid,

1277
01:47:57,542 --> 01:48:00,621
younger than you,
I bumped into something like these things

1278
01:48:00,645 --> 01:48:03,491
that ate like they do.

1279
01:48:03,515 --> 01:48:05,719
Only it wasn't a person,
it was a place.

1280
01:48:07,353 --> 01:48:12,166
They closed it down after
and let it rot.

1281
01:48:12,190 --> 01:48:14,394
But the things
that lived there, they...

1282
01:48:16,461 --> 01:48:18,507
Don't go poking around in there
again.

1283
01:48:18,531 --> 01:48:21,201
Okay, I won't. I promise.

1284
01:48:34,514 --> 01:48:36,791
We're almost ready.
We're just loading up.

1285
01:48:36,815 --> 01:48:38,259
Good.

1286
01:48:38,283 --> 01:48:39,561
Get the caravan on the road

1287
01:48:39,585 --> 01:48:41,163
and we'll have her
in a day or two.

1288
01:48:41,187 --> 01:48:43,632
I don't think
you should come, Rosie.

1289
01:48:43,656 --> 01:48:46,602
The fuck
did you just say?

1290
01:48:46,626 --> 01:48:47,803
She tagged you.

1291
01:48:47,827 --> 01:48:49,303
She got in your head.

1292
01:48:49,327 --> 01:48:51,205
Yeah, it won't happen again.

1293
01:48:51,229 --> 01:48:53,142
And who knows how much she got
to before you kicked her out.

1294
01:48:53,166 --> 01:48:54,476
She's mine, Crow.

1295
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:55,811
Right now, as far as we know,

1296
01:48:55,835 --> 01:48:58,347
you are the only one of us
she could track.

1297
01:48:58,371 --> 01:49:00,382
Now, if she sees you coming,

1298
01:49:00,406 --> 01:49:01,682
she could run

1299
01:49:01,706 --> 01:49:03,642
or set another trap.

1300
01:49:05,243 --> 01:49:07,588
I will knock her out cold.

1301
01:49:07,612 --> 01:49:10,691
One of our assets from the NSA
gave me the good stuff.

1302
01:49:10,715 --> 01:49:13,896
Put her out without
chance of an overdose.

1303
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:16,697
I'll head south.
I'll circle around.

1304
01:49:16,721 --> 01:49:18,633
I'll come at her
from a different direction.

1305
01:49:18,657 --> 01:49:19,868
I should be there.

1306
01:49:19,892 --> 01:49:21,827
You know I'm right about this.

1307
01:49:26,299 --> 01:49:27,466
Okay.

1308
01:49:29,335 --> 01:49:31,413
I'll leave Andi here with you,
if you want.

1309
01:49:31,437 --> 01:49:34,182
No, no, you'll need your
strength, all of you.

1310
01:49:34,206 --> 01:49:36,185
If she pulls a trick on you,

1311
01:49:36,209 --> 01:49:38,253
stay together.

1312
01:49:38,277 --> 01:49:39,221
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1313
01:49:39,245 --> 01:49:40,588
Mm-hmm.

1314
01:49:40,612 --> 01:49:42,681
But I got some tricks
of my own.

1315
01:49:48,621 --> 01:49:50,422
Hey,
I think we're here.

1316
01:49:52,858 --> 01:49:53,858
Okay.

1317
01:49:55,528 --> 01:49:57,164
I'll see if I can get her.

1318
01:49:58,397 --> 01:49:59,397
Abra?

1319
01:50:01,267 --> 01:50:03,978
That's the sign.
Pull around back.

1320
01:50:04,002 --> 01:50:05,580
She says to pull around back.

1321
01:50:05,604 --> 01:50:06,714
And I'll tell you when to stop.

1322
01:50:06,738 --> 01:50:08,507
She'll tell us when to stop.

1323
01:50:14,846 --> 01:50:16,857
I gotta tell you,
Danno,

1324
01:50:16,881 --> 01:50:19,527
I don't know whether I hope
you're right or wrong about this.

1325
01:50:19,551 --> 01:50:23,231
I mean, if you're wrong,
my friend is crazy.

1326
01:50:23,255 --> 01:50:27,002
I mean, full-blown,
mental breakdown,

1327
01:50:27,026 --> 01:50:30,771
imaginary-monsters-
killing-imaginary-kids

1328
01:50:30,795 --> 01:50:32,507
bonkers.

1329
01:50:32,531 --> 01:50:34,901
But, you know, I...
I can work with that.

1330
01:50:36,269 --> 01:50:37,545
If you're right, though...

1331
01:50:37,569 --> 01:50:39,280
I know.

1332
01:50:39,304 --> 01:50:40,706
It's much worse.

1333
01:50:54,886 --> 01:50:56,464
You should go home.

1334
01:50:56,488 --> 01:50:58,299
What?

1335
01:50:58,323 --> 01:50:59,625
No, not you.

1336
01:51:00,693 --> 01:51:01,937
I can handle it.

1337
01:51:01,961 --> 01:51:04,631
No. We'll take it from here.

1338
01:51:07,700 --> 01:51:09,536
Okay, it's just us.

1339
01:51:26,519 --> 01:51:27,754
You smell that?

1340
01:51:30,723 --> 01:51:33,035
Used to hunt.
I ever tell you that?

1341
01:51:33,059 --> 01:51:34,468
No.

1342
01:51:34,492 --> 01:51:35,492
Deer.

1343
01:51:35,995 --> 01:51:37,464
This one summer,

1344
01:51:38,596 --> 01:51:40,508
I clipped this buck.

1345
01:51:40,532 --> 01:51:42,878
I was tracking it for two days.

1346
01:51:42,902 --> 01:51:46,315
I got the shot, clipped him.

1347
01:51:46,339 --> 01:51:48,583
He ran off, I went after.

1348
01:51:48,607 --> 01:51:51,986
Figured he wasn't
gonna last long.

1349
01:51:53,845 --> 01:51:55,490
Then he vanished.

1350
01:51:55,514 --> 01:51:58,560
Just up and evaporated.

1351
01:51:58,584 --> 01:52:01,020
Not a trace. Truly baffling.

1352
01:52:03,988 --> 01:52:05,499
Five days later,

1353
01:52:05,523 --> 01:52:08,469
I'm trying a different spot,
miles away.

1354
01:52:08,493 --> 01:52:11,598
I come around looking
for a spot for a blind...

1355
01:52:13,532 --> 01:52:14,801
then I smelled him.

1356
01:52:16,402 --> 01:52:17,703
Smelled him.

1357
01:52:18,804 --> 01:52:20,682
Found that buck

1358
01:52:20,706 --> 01:52:22,942
holed up to a hollow trunk,

1359
01:52:23,776 --> 01:52:25,478
dead for days.

1360
01:52:26,812 --> 01:52:28,381
The smell...

1361
01:52:29,648 --> 01:52:31,518
Never hunted a day since.

1362
01:52:34,987 --> 01:52:36,956
This is the same smell.

1363
01:52:52,871 --> 01:52:54,373
Billy.

1364
01:53:13,858 --> 01:53:15,060
Oh, my God!

1365
01:53:48,093 --> 01:53:49,137
Fuck.

1366
01:53:49,161 --> 01:53:51,705
Fuck, Danno. What the fuck?

1367
01:53:51,729 --> 01:53:54,476
They didn't even bury him deep.
They buried him shallow.

1368
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:55,502
I'm sorry, Billy.

1369
01:53:57,135 --> 01:53:58,804
What did you
get us into?

1370
01:54:07,212 --> 01:54:08,789
The people
who did that...

1371
01:54:08,813 --> 01:54:09,948
They're not people.

1372
01:54:11,216 --> 01:54:14,062
No. No, they ain't.

1373
01:54:14,086 --> 01:54:15,822
Anyone do that to a little boy,

1374
01:54:17,156 --> 01:54:19,500
they ain't people.

1375
01:54:19,524 --> 01:54:20,735
Did you get it?

1376
01:54:20,759 --> 01:54:21,870
Yeah, we got it.

1377
01:54:21,894 --> 01:54:23,737
Is she back?

1378
01:54:23,761 --> 01:54:25,673
We're heading back to you.
We'll be back in the morning.

1379
01:54:25,697 --> 01:54:26,799
We got a stop to make.

1380
01:54:29,201 --> 01:54:31,671
I need you to show your parents
what's happening.

1381
01:54:32,170 --> 01:54:33,882
No.

1382
01:54:33,906 --> 01:54:36,218
- Yeah.
- No. They almost think I'm normal.

1383
01:54:36,242 --> 01:54:37,852
If I tell them, they'll...

1384
01:54:37,876 --> 01:54:39,553
Rose'll go through them
to get to you.

1385
01:54:39,577 --> 01:54:40,989
You know that, don't you?

1386
01:54:41,013 --> 01:54:42,824
She'll cut them down
without a second thought.

1387
01:54:42,848 --> 01:54:44,651
And she's coming, Abra.

1388
01:54:45,149 --> 01:54:47,019
They need to know.

1389
01:54:51,756 --> 01:54:54,002
So, what's this stop
we gotta make?

1390
01:54:54,026 --> 01:54:56,162
You still got
those old deer rifles?

1391
01:55:13,778 --> 01:55:15,589
You're Uncle Dan?

1392
01:55:15,613 --> 01:55:16,958
- The fuck you think you are?
- Sir...

1393
01:55:16,982 --> 01:55:18,959
Hmm? Hmm? She is 13 years old!

1394
01:55:18,983 --> 01:55:20,294
Abra, I told you to show him.

1395
01:55:20,318 --> 01:55:22,097
- I told him.
- Well, that's not the same.

1396
01:55:22,121 --> 01:55:23,531
I'm gonna kick your ass
before I call the police, huh?

1397
01:55:23,555 --> 01:55:24,699
- Hey, hey, hey!
- No, no, no. Abra.

1398
01:55:24,723 --> 01:55:25,866
Now, don't you say her name.

1399
01:55:25,890 --> 01:55:26,925
Abra...

1400
01:55:41,806 --> 01:55:45,085
I'm sorry, Mr. Stone.
I am a friend.

1401
01:55:45,109 --> 01:55:47,580
Everything she told you
is true.

1402
01:55:50,349 --> 01:55:52,093
What the hell is happening?

1403
01:55:52,117 --> 01:55:53,895
I'm sorry.

1404
01:55:53,919 --> 01:55:56,263
Abra needs to
show you something.

1405
01:55:56,287 --> 01:55:57,699
<i>I saw the boy.</i>

1406
01:55:57,723 --> 01:55:58,725
<i>I saw his body.</i>

1407
01:55:59,358 --> 01:56:00,901
It's all true.

1408
01:56:00,925 --> 01:56:02,525
Probably, your friend here
put him there.

1409
01:56:03,629 --> 01:56:05,307
You think about that?

1410
01:56:05,331 --> 01:56:06,775
Not for long, I didn't.

1411
01:56:06,799 --> 01:56:09,110
Mr. Stone,
your daughter is special.

1412
01:56:09,134 --> 01:56:10,344
Don't talk about her.

1413
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:12,671
I think you know that.
Deep down.

1414
01:56:14,238 --> 01:56:16,985
She knows what happened
to that little boy,

1415
01:56:17,009 --> 01:56:18,810
and she knows who did it.

1416
01:56:19,812 --> 01:56:20,880
Show him.

1417
01:56:25,250 --> 01:56:26,761
I'm sorry, Daddy.

1418
01:56:26,785 --> 01:56:29,030
I really didn't want to.

1419
01:56:29,054 --> 01:56:30,164
Didn't want to what?

1420
01:56:48,806 --> 01:56:49,817
No, thanks.

1421
01:56:49,841 --> 01:56:51,186
No.

1422
01:57:00,118 --> 01:57:01,353
Those people...

1423
01:57:03,154 --> 01:57:05,032
they know about my daughter?

1424
01:57:05,056 --> 01:57:06,767
They do.

1425
01:57:06,791 --> 01:57:09,236
And sooner or later,
they're coming.

1426
01:57:09,260 --> 01:57:10,871
We gotta do something.

1427
01:57:10,895 --> 01:57:12,941
All right, we're calling
the police, the FBI...

1428
01:57:12,965 --> 01:57:15,677
These people have been
around a long, long time, sir.

1429
01:57:15,701 --> 01:57:17,212
They're rich, connected.

1430
01:57:17,236 --> 01:57:19,780
I don't think they're worried
about the police.

1431
01:57:19,804 --> 01:57:21,249
But where are they?

1432
01:57:21,273 --> 01:57:23,718
When are they coming?
Where can we go?

1433
01:57:23,742 --> 01:57:25,754
Abra can answer that...

1434
01:57:25,778 --> 01:57:27,080
if she's ready.

1435
01:57:28,246 --> 01:57:29,314
I'm ready.

1436
01:57:39,291 --> 01:57:41,302
You sure you wanna do this?

1437
01:57:41,326 --> 01:57:42,795
I have to.

1438
01:58:25,037 --> 01:58:26,815
I-95.

1439
01:58:26,839 --> 01:58:29,217
Barry, the Crow, the Snake,
and a few others.

1440
01:58:29,241 --> 01:58:31,119
The trees haven't
changed that much,

1441
01:58:31,143 --> 01:58:33,487
so maybe Massachusetts,

1442
01:58:33,511 --> 01:58:35,423
- but they're close.
- Rose?

1443
01:58:35,447 --> 01:58:37,325
Didn't see her.

1444
01:58:37,349 --> 01:58:38,885
But they're coming.

1445
01:58:42,787 --> 01:58:45,165
This is the only room she saw?

1446
01:58:45,189 --> 01:58:46,500
That's right.

1447
01:58:46,524 --> 01:58:49,904
And I made a few changes.
Hid a few things.

1448
01:58:49,928 --> 01:58:51,940
All right.

1449
01:58:51,964 --> 01:58:54,209
Well, they'll be trying
to track you,

1450
01:58:54,233 --> 01:58:56,035
trying to catch on.

1451
01:58:57,903 --> 01:58:59,205
And you're gonna let them.

1452
01:59:00,773 --> 01:59:02,083
Are you crazy?

1453
01:59:02,107 --> 01:59:04,352
Possibly, but you're
gonna let them.

1454
01:59:04,376 --> 01:59:06,879
And then I need you to try
and do a little trick.

1455
01:59:07,912 --> 01:59:09,214
A magic trick?

1456
01:59:17,089 --> 01:59:19,133
They're following us.

1457
01:59:19,157 --> 01:59:22,003
Concentrate. You gotta keep it
up until they land.

1458
01:59:22,027 --> 01:59:23,027
I know.

1459
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:56,271
This should work.

1460
01:59:56,295 --> 01:59:58,831
Good blinds over there,
and there.

1461
02:00:02,134 --> 02:00:03,244
They still close?

1462
02:00:03,268 --> 02:00:04,370
Getting closer, I think.

1463
02:00:05,269 --> 02:00:06,414
This is tough.

1464
02:00:06,438 --> 02:00:08,940
I know. I know.
Not much longer.

1465
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:14,147
Okay, Crow Daddy,

1466
02:00:15,147 --> 02:00:16,448
go get her.

1467
02:01:03,394 --> 02:01:06,074
You look relaxed.

1468
02:01:06,098 --> 02:01:08,501
You feel relaxed,
don't you, Abra?

1469
02:01:09,902 --> 02:01:10,978
I guess.

1470
02:01:11,002 --> 02:01:12,138
You should.

1471
02:01:12,938 --> 02:01:14,581
Just relax.

1472
02:01:14,605 --> 02:01:16,250
We're friends.

1473
02:01:16,274 --> 02:01:18,018
You're friends.

1474
02:01:18,042 --> 02:01:19,178
That's right.

1475
02:01:20,211 --> 02:01:22,322
Just friends.

1476
02:01:22,346 --> 02:01:25,384
And we want to take you
to meet more friends.

1477
02:01:27,152 --> 02:01:28,287
Good friends.

1478
02:01:32,623 --> 02:01:34,134
Well, shit.

1479
02:01:34,158 --> 02:01:35,637
The way they talked you up,

1480
02:01:35,661 --> 02:01:37,672
I was thinking it'd be
a little harder than that.

1481
02:01:42,466 --> 02:01:44,212
The fuck?

1482
02:01:44,236 --> 02:01:46,481
Parlor tricks.
Just fuckin' parlor tricks.

1483
02:01:51,076 --> 02:01:52,453
No! Get out of there!

1484
02:01:52,477 --> 02:01:53,546
Get out of there!

1485
02:02:00,085 --> 02:02:02,587
No!

1486
02:02:15,634 --> 02:02:16,669
No!

1487
02:02:26,478 --> 02:02:27,655
<i>You deserve it.</i>

1488
02:02:27,679 --> 02:02:30,325
You deserve it. All of you.

1489
02:02:35,453 --> 02:02:36,453
No!

1490
02:03:32,176 --> 02:03:33,312
Oh, fuck.

1491
02:03:35,413 --> 02:03:36,413
Stop.

1492
02:03:41,219 --> 02:03:44,056
I just got one question
for you, sweetie.

1493
02:03:45,357 --> 02:03:47,067
Aren't you sleepy?

1494
02:03:49,627 --> 02:03:51,330
You're sleepy.

1495
02:03:56,233 --> 02:03:57,268
Sleep.

1496
02:03:59,403 --> 02:04:00,605
Sleep.

1497
02:04:02,107 --> 02:04:04,619
Wake up! Uncle Dan!

1498
02:04:04,643 --> 02:04:07,155
Wake up! Wake up.

1499
02:04:07,179 --> 02:04:08,514
<i>Wake up!</i>

1500
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:11,082
Fucking men.

1501
02:04:12,716 --> 02:04:14,586
Fucking men.

1502
02:04:31,103 --> 02:04:32,538
Stay back, Billy.

1503
02:04:35,540 --> 02:04:37,243
Kill yourself.

1504
02:04:39,778 --> 02:04:41,155
No!

1505
02:04:41,179 --> 02:04:42,681
Billy!

1506
02:04:58,863 --> 02:05:01,308
There is one missing.

1507
02:05:01,332 --> 02:05:03,744
I didn't see the Crow.
Where is the Crow?

1508
02:05:06,138 --> 02:05:07,406
Hello, Abra.

1509
02:05:13,612 --> 02:05:15,214
Abra!

1510
02:05:18,817 --> 02:05:20,586
Get away from her.

1511
02:05:23,721 --> 02:05:24,723
Step back.

1512
02:05:27,725 --> 02:05:29,394
Sure thing, Dad.

1513
02:05:31,229 --> 02:05:33,206
You know, I'm glad
I got to meet you.

1514
02:05:33,230 --> 02:05:35,843
I'll fucking kill you.
Step back.

1515
02:05:35,867 --> 02:05:37,712
Some brave words.

1516
02:05:37,736 --> 02:05:41,273
Always tickles me,
watching you rubes threaten a god.

1517
02:05:42,407 --> 02:05:44,552
You know, your little girl,

1518
02:05:44,576 --> 02:05:48,188
she's maybe the best food
we'll ever have.

1519
02:05:48,212 --> 02:05:51,382
I'm so glad I had a chance
to compliment the chef.

1520
02:06:29,554 --> 02:06:31,323
Oh, good, you're awake.

1521
02:06:41,733 --> 02:06:42,877
Dan...

1522
02:06:42,901 --> 02:06:44,370
Don't bother.

1523
02:06:51,576 --> 02:06:53,521
What's wrong with me?

1524
02:06:53,545 --> 02:06:55,623
You've been dosed, missy.

1525
02:06:55,647 --> 02:06:58,392
More than
I've ever used before.

1526
02:06:58,416 --> 02:07:00,727
Might let you wake up
here and there,

1527
02:07:00,751 --> 02:07:03,221
but that steam of yours
is fast asleep.

1528
02:07:06,491 --> 02:07:07,693
My dad...

1529
02:07:08,926 --> 02:07:10,771
What happened to my dad?

1530
02:07:10,795 --> 02:07:12,565
Lot of good people
killed today.

1531
02:07:13,531 --> 02:07:14,934
Lot of good people.

1532
02:07:16,635 --> 02:07:18,946
I'd love to tell you
someone will pay,

1533
02:07:18,970 --> 02:07:23,918
some kind of justice raining
down on the sad events today,

1534
02:07:23,942 --> 02:07:26,454
but it don't work like that.

1535
02:07:26,478 --> 02:07:28,247
We were always gonna have you.

1536
02:07:29,514 --> 02:07:31,825
Some of my people are dead.

1537
02:07:31,849 --> 02:07:33,518
Some of yours are dead.

1538
02:07:34,618 --> 02:07:37,597
Outcome didn't change, though.

1539
02:07:37,621 --> 02:07:38,890
Think on that a minute.

1540
02:07:39,957 --> 02:07:41,559
The outcome didn't change.

1541
02:07:42,460 --> 02:07:43,729
So, their deaths,

1542
02:07:44,729 --> 02:07:46,574
all of them,

1543
02:07:46,598 --> 02:07:48,875
just a waste.

1544
02:07:48,899 --> 02:07:50,311
A waste you brought on

1545
02:07:50,335 --> 02:07:52,413
to us all, young lady.

1546
02:07:52,437 --> 02:07:53,580
For what?

1547
02:07:55,473 --> 02:07:57,351
Please hear me...

1548
02:07:57,375 --> 02:08:00,288
Ain't nobody
hearing you.

1549
02:08:00,312 --> 02:08:02,680
Might as well calm down
and enjoy the ride.

1550
02:08:03,715 --> 02:08:05,993
Like I said,

1551
02:08:06,017 --> 02:08:08,287
outcome hasn't changed.

1552
02:08:28,572 --> 02:08:29,774
No.

1553
02:08:31,509 --> 02:08:32,953
Please.

1554
02:08:32,977 --> 02:08:35,046
Oh, please, please, please.

1555
02:08:36,613 --> 02:08:37,649
Please.

1556
02:08:41,353 --> 02:08:42,621
Abra!

1557
02:08:45,889 --> 02:08:47,292
<i>Abra.</i>

1558
02:08:54,366 --> 02:08:55,634
Tony?

1559
02:08:57,669 --> 02:08:59,537
Help me, please, Tony.

1560
02:09:05,143 --> 02:09:06,444
God.

1561
02:09:16,787 --> 02:09:18,999
Okay. Okay.

1562
02:09:19,023 --> 02:09:20,567
Okay, okay.

1563
02:09:20,591 --> 02:09:23,003
Okay, you always said...

1564
02:09:23,027 --> 02:09:24,804
your brain was like a radio.

1565
02:09:24,828 --> 02:09:27,641
No one's answering when you
call, so stop calling.

1566
02:09:27,665 --> 02:09:29,068
And just listen.

1567
02:09:46,818 --> 02:09:49,163
<i>Dan. Dan.</i>

1568
02:09:49,187 --> 02:09:50,589
<i>Help.</i>

1569
02:10:04,669 --> 02:10:05,780
Hi.

1570
02:10:05,804 --> 02:10:06,872
Dan.

1571
02:10:10,073 --> 02:10:11,442
Did he drug you?

1572
02:10:12,810 --> 02:10:13,978
I'm so sorry.

1573
02:10:15,746 --> 02:10:17,691
I'm gonna try something, okay?

1574
02:10:17,715 --> 02:10:18,691
But you're weak.

1575
02:10:18,715 --> 02:10:20,561
He's blocking you.

1576
02:10:20,585 --> 02:10:22,730
I could barely hear you.

1577
02:10:22,754 --> 02:10:24,422
You gotta trust me, okay?

1578
02:10:26,056 --> 02:10:27,526
Okay?

1579
02:10:41,473 --> 02:10:43,883
Awake again, huh?

1580
02:10:43,907 --> 02:10:47,078
Might have to
dose you at the next rest stop.

1581
02:10:49,147 --> 02:10:50,649
Where are we going?

1582
02:10:51,616 --> 02:10:52,850
Mm, you know where.

1583
02:10:53,917 --> 02:10:55,987
Fuck, I feel hungover.

1584
02:10:58,857 --> 02:11:01,535
I told you it's good shit.

1585
02:11:01,559 --> 02:11:04,672
Haven't felt hungover in years.
And, you know, I don't miss it.

1586
02:11:04,696 --> 02:11:05,898
Not even a little.

1587
02:11:08,032 --> 02:11:09,843
West, huh?

1588
02:11:09,867 --> 02:11:12,770
Stayin' off the major roads.
Smart.

1589
02:11:14,839 --> 02:11:17,576
Crownville. New York.

1590
02:11:20,745 --> 02:11:22,990
Who are you?

1591
02:11:23,014 --> 02:11:24,817
I'm the guy
that killed your friends.

1592
02:11:30,787 --> 02:11:32,156
It's nice to meet you.

1593
02:11:34,024 --> 02:11:35,669
Neat trick.

1594
02:11:35,693 --> 02:11:37,638
Haven't seen this one before.

1595
02:11:37,662 --> 02:11:39,231
Wanna see one more?

1596
02:11:42,666 --> 02:11:46,137
Don't imagine Rose'll be too
happy if you shoot the prize.

1597
02:11:48,872 --> 02:11:52,285
I don't suppose Rose will be
happy about any of this.

1598
02:11:52,309 --> 02:11:55,054
And when that woman gets mad...

1599
02:11:55,078 --> 02:11:57,691
Well, it seems to me
you know enough

1600
02:11:57,715 --> 02:12:00,593
to know you might wanna
sit this one out.

1601
02:12:00,617 --> 02:12:02,062
Count your blessings.

1602
02:12:02,086 --> 02:12:03,931
Go on your way.

1603
02:12:06,090 --> 02:12:07,767
What's so funny, friend?

1604
02:12:07,791 --> 02:12:11,771
Well, it's just arrogance.
It's arrogance, really.

1605
02:12:11,795 --> 02:12:15,174
But it makes sense,
if you think you're gonna live forever.

1606
02:12:15,198 --> 02:12:19,571
Stands to reason,
of course you wouldn't wear your seatbelt.

1607
02:12:29,147 --> 02:12:32,251
No!

1608
02:12:42,794 --> 02:12:43,961
Dan?

1609
02:12:45,596 --> 02:12:46,874
Dan?

1610
02:13:18,162 --> 02:13:19,731
I hope that hurts.

1611
02:13:20,297 --> 02:13:21,632
Rosie...

1612
02:13:22,666 --> 02:13:23,710
A lot.

1613
02:14:11,715 --> 02:14:13,751
You little bitch.

1614
02:14:15,853 --> 02:14:17,922
What have you done?

1615
02:14:29,300 --> 02:14:31,069
All right, bitch child.

1616
02:14:32,103 --> 02:14:33,103
All right.

1617
02:15:41,404 --> 02:15:42,849
Sorry.

1618
02:15:42,873 --> 02:15:44,017
Dozed off.

1619
02:15:44,041 --> 02:15:45,744
No, you earned it.

1620
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:50,289
Where are we?

1621
02:15:50,313 --> 02:15:51,782
Ohio.

1622
02:15:52,315 --> 02:15:53,427
Where are we going?

1623
02:15:53,451 --> 02:15:54,453
Colorado.

1624
02:15:56,153 --> 02:15:57,723
Why Colorado?

1625
02:16:00,224 --> 02:16:01,993
She's gonna keep coming.

1626
02:16:03,126 --> 02:16:04,729
- I know.
- Always.

1627
02:16:06,096 --> 02:16:07,473
This only ends if we end it,

1628
02:16:07,497 --> 02:16:09,942
and I don't think
we can beat her.

1629
02:16:09,966 --> 02:16:11,402
Not by ourselves.

1630
02:16:13,571 --> 02:16:15,214
There's a place.

1631
02:16:15,238 --> 02:16:18,051
A place that's dangerous
for people like us.

1632
02:16:18,075 --> 02:16:21,221
The place you told me about?
The hungry place?

1633
02:16:21,245 --> 02:16:22,889
Yeah, that's right.

1634
02:16:22,913 --> 02:16:25,793
If it's so dangerous,
why would we go there?

1635
02:16:25,817 --> 02:16:28,195
Well, if it's dangerous
for people like us,

1636
02:16:28,219 --> 02:16:31,130
I expect it's dangerous
for people like her.

1637
02:16:31,154 --> 02:16:32,890
Maybe even more so.

1638
02:16:33,957 --> 02:16:34,957
Good.

1639
02:16:36,026 --> 02:16:37,795
She's following us, you know.

1640
02:16:38,895 --> 02:16:40,799
Yeah, good. Let her.

1641
02:16:48,406 --> 02:16:50,107
I'm sorry about your father.

1642
02:16:52,876 --> 02:16:54,345
Sorry about your friend.

1643
02:17:17,168 --> 02:17:19,580
It's my mom.

1644
02:17:19,604 --> 02:17:20,938
What do I say to her?

1645
02:17:25,609 --> 02:17:26,553
Hi, Mom.

1646
02:17:26,577 --> 02:17:27,921
Oh, thank God!

1647
02:17:27,945 --> 02:17:29,089
Abra...

1648
02:17:29,113 --> 02:17:30,815
Are you okay? Where are you?

1649
02:17:31,649 --> 02:17:33,051
I love you.

1650
02:17:36,087 --> 02:17:38,431
When we're safe, you'll call her
and tell her where to find us?

1651
02:17:38,455 --> 02:17:39,600
I will.

1652
02:17:39,624 --> 02:17:41,026
Okay.

1653
02:18:14,659 --> 02:18:17,062
Not too much further.
Up the mountain.

1654
02:19:52,623 --> 02:19:54,401
Here's what we're gonna do.

1655
02:19:54,425 --> 02:19:57,269
You're gonna stay in the car,
keep the heater running.

1656
02:19:57,293 --> 02:20:00,474
I don't want you spending a minute
inside there if you don't have to.

1657
02:20:00,498 --> 02:20:02,242
She can only come from here.

1658
02:20:02,266 --> 02:20:03,777
You can see her a mile out,
easy.

1659
02:20:03,801 --> 02:20:06,145
You see lights
on the mountain over there,

1660
02:20:06,169 --> 02:20:07,714
you blast me, okay?

1661
02:20:07,738 --> 02:20:11,183
But I don't want you going in.
Not until she's here.

1662
02:20:11,207 --> 02:20:13,687
You aren't waiting with me?

1663
02:20:13,711 --> 02:20:14,653
I can't.

1664
02:20:14,677 --> 02:20:15,679
Why not?

1665
02:20:16,647 --> 02:20:18,249
I have to wake it up.

1666
02:21:20,243 --> 02:21:21,479
Wakey-wakey.

1667
02:26:01,024 --> 02:26:02,936
Slow night, Mr. Torrance.

1668
02:26:02,960 --> 02:26:04,829
Not for long, I imagine.

1669
02:26:06,630 --> 02:26:08,641
You're a whiskey man,
are you not?

1670
02:26:08,665 --> 02:26:10,767
I was, most of the time.

1671
02:26:18,442 --> 02:26:19,844
On the house.

1672
02:26:23,614 --> 02:26:25,759
This was your brand.

1673
02:26:25,783 --> 02:26:27,593
Jack Daniel's.

1674
02:26:27,617 --> 02:26:29,995
I used to see the bottles
in our home.

1675
02:26:30,019 --> 02:26:33,532
Our real home, before all this.

1676
02:26:33,556 --> 02:26:36,728
I smelled one once. It smelled
like something on fire,

1677
02:26:37,894 --> 02:26:40,573
which I suppose it was.

1678
02:26:40,597 --> 02:26:43,109
I'm afraid you've
confused me with someone else.

1679
02:26:43,133 --> 02:26:44,669
It's Lloyd.

1680
02:26:45,168 --> 02:26:46,570
Lloyd.

1681
02:26:47,904 --> 02:26:50,048
I apologize, Mr. Torrance.

1682
02:26:50,072 --> 02:26:53,986
I don't know where everyone is,
but it'll pick up.

1683
02:26:54,010 --> 02:26:55,888
Oh, I know where they are.

1684
02:26:55,912 --> 02:26:57,014
And you're right...

1685
02:26:57,881 --> 02:26:59,050
it'll pick up.

1686
02:27:01,218 --> 02:27:04,020
If you don't mind my saying,
Mr. Torrance, you seem...

1687
02:27:05,656 --> 02:27:06,791
put upon.

1688
02:27:07,791 --> 02:27:09,635
Put upon?

1689
02:27:09,659 --> 02:27:10,927
Ain't that the way.

1690
02:27:11,928 --> 02:27:13,873
Man just living his life,

1691
02:27:13,897 --> 02:27:15,975
trying to do his work.

1692
02:27:15,999 --> 02:27:18,076
He gets put upon.

1693
02:27:18,100 --> 02:27:19,846
Pulled into
other people's problems.

1694
02:27:19,870 --> 02:27:22,706
I see it all the time,
if you don't mind my saying.

1695
02:27:25,676 --> 02:27:27,678
So we lived in Florida.

1696
02:27:28,712 --> 02:27:29,722
I'm sorry?

1697
02:27:29,746 --> 02:27:31,790
Mom and I.

1698
02:27:31,814 --> 02:27:34,085
I'm afraid I don't know
who you mean.

1699
02:27:36,620 --> 02:27:39,599
We never wanted
to see snow again,

1700
02:27:39,623 --> 02:27:41,801
so we lived in Florida.

1701
02:27:41,825 --> 02:27:45,071
Tiny place, but it was
comfortable, and we were happy.

1702
02:27:45,095 --> 02:27:46,998
I mean, we were grieving.

1703
02:27:49,766 --> 02:27:51,710
We were traumatized,

1704
02:27:51,734 --> 02:27:53,504
but there was happiness too.

1705
02:27:56,706 --> 02:27:57,706
She...

1706
02:27:59,209 --> 02:28:01,487
She would look away.

1707
02:28:01,511 --> 02:28:04,916
She'd look at me, but she'd always
look away after a second or two.

1708
02:28:06,183 --> 02:28:08,027
It took me a while
to notice it.

1709
02:28:08,051 --> 02:28:10,496
But after the Overlook, she
wouldn't look me in the eyes,

1710
02:28:10,520 --> 02:28:12,232
not for long.

1711
02:28:12,256 --> 02:28:13,858
Couldn't figure it out.

1712
02:28:16,293 --> 02:28:17,294
But it...

1713
02:28:21,163 --> 02:28:22,533
It was you.

1714
02:28:24,867 --> 02:28:28,538
She saw your eyes in me,
and she'd have to look away.

1715
02:28:29,907 --> 02:28:31,751
It tortured her
to have to do that.

1716
02:28:31,775 --> 02:28:33,653
So, I fixed it.

1717
02:28:33,677 --> 02:28:36,689
I fixed it for her, and it was
the last time I ever used it.

1718
02:28:36,713 --> 02:28:39,750
So that she wouldn't see you
anymore when she looked at me.

1719
02:28:42,819 --> 02:28:45,098
I was 20 when she died.

1720
02:28:45,122 --> 02:28:48,967
And back then, I saw
when someone was gonna die.

1721
02:28:48,991 --> 02:28:51,170
I saw flies. Black flies.

1722
02:28:51,194 --> 02:28:55,040
"Death flies," I called them,
circling people's faces.

1723
02:28:55,064 --> 02:28:57,911
And in those last weeks,
she was covered...

1724
02:28:57,935 --> 02:28:59,778
Her whole face.

1725
02:28:59,802 --> 02:29:02,915
I could barely see her eyes.

1726
02:29:02,939 --> 02:29:07,853
And I... I tried to comfort her,
but I could hardly look at her.

1727
02:29:07,877 --> 02:29:09,779
And she saw that.

1728
02:29:12,115 --> 02:29:14,192
She just lay there dying,

1729
02:29:14,216 --> 02:29:16,120
with her son
who couldn't look at her.

1730
02:29:22,159 --> 02:29:25,838
Maybe something warm to
push away such unpleasantries.

1731
02:29:25,862 --> 02:29:28,907
Don't you wanna hear about it?
She was your wife.

1732
02:29:28,931 --> 02:29:32,045
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

1733
02:29:32,069 --> 02:29:35,348
- I'm just a bartender.
- Oh, yeah?

1734
02:29:35,372 --> 02:29:38,617
Just Lloyd the bartender,
pouring joy at the Overlook Hotel.

1735
02:29:38,641 --> 02:29:41,211
I'll pour whatever you like,
Mr. Torrance.

1736
02:29:42,812 --> 02:29:43,947
Oh, Dad.

1737
02:29:45,882 --> 02:29:48,093
This drink will cost
an awful lot.

1738
02:29:48,117 --> 02:29:50,128
Your money is no good here.

1739
02:29:50,152 --> 02:29:51,998
Orders from the house.

1740
02:29:52,022 --> 02:29:53,966
It'll cost more than money.

1741
02:29:53,990 --> 02:29:56,335
It'll cost me eight years.

1742
02:29:56,359 --> 02:29:58,870
Eight behind me, and who knows
how many in front of me.

1743
02:29:58,894 --> 02:30:01,331
Your credit is fine,
Mr. Torrance.

1744
02:30:08,804 --> 02:30:10,675
Man takes a drink,

1745
02:30:11,775 --> 02:30:13,077
the drink takes a drink,

1746
02:30:14,243 --> 02:30:16,079
and then the drink takes a man.

1747
02:30:17,147 --> 02:30:18,848
Ain't it so, Dad?

1748
02:30:22,986 --> 02:30:24,287
Medicine.

1749
02:30:25,989 --> 02:30:27,858
Medicine is what it is.

1750
02:30:28,858 --> 02:30:31,103
Bona fide cure-all.

1751
02:30:31,127 --> 02:30:35,966
Depression, stress, remorse,
failure, wipes it all away.

1752
02:30:37,733 --> 02:30:39,803
The mind is a blackboard.

1753
02:30:40,269 --> 02:30:41,605
And this

1754
02:30:42,304 --> 02:30:43,808
is the eraser.

1755
02:30:49,079 --> 02:30:51,189
A man tries.

1756
02:30:51,213 --> 02:30:52,349
He provides.

1757
02:30:53,749 --> 02:30:55,928
But he's surrounded by mouths.

1758
02:30:55,952 --> 02:30:59,064
that eat, and scream, and cry,
and nag.

1759
02:30:59,088 --> 02:31:02,701
So, he asks for one thing,
just one thing for him.

1760
02:31:02,725 --> 02:31:04,236
To warm him up...

1761
02:31:04,260 --> 02:31:07,305
to take the sting out of
those days of the mouths,

1762
02:31:07,329 --> 02:31:10,075
eating, and eating, and eating
everything he makes,

1763
02:31:10,099 --> 02:31:12,679
everything he has.

1764
02:31:12,703 --> 02:31:14,246
And a family.

1765
02:31:14,270 --> 02:31:16,373
A wife, a kid.

1766
02:31:17,908 --> 02:31:20,252
Those mouths eat time.

1767
02:31:20,276 --> 02:31:21,879
They eat your days on Earth.

1768
02:31:23,279 --> 02:31:24,882
They just gobble them up.

1769
02:31:26,348 --> 02:31:28,752
It's enough to make a man sick.

1770
02:31:29,720 --> 02:31:30,787
And this...

1771
02:31:32,122 --> 02:31:34,025
is the medicine.

1772
02:31:36,159 --> 02:31:39,105
So, tell me, pup,

1773
02:31:39,129 --> 02:31:41,766
are you gonna
take your medicine?

1774
02:31:44,801 --> 02:31:46,378
I'm not.

1775
02:31:48,404 --> 02:31:49,749
Oh.

1776
02:31:49,773 --> 02:31:51,117
Look at that. I'm sorry.

1777
02:31:51,141 --> 02:31:54,111
Clumsy old me, Mr. Torrance.
Forgive me.

1778
02:31:55,746 --> 02:31:57,114
Let's get you cleaned up.

1779
02:32:15,431 --> 02:32:17,410
Management is concerned.

1780
02:32:17,434 --> 02:32:18,803
Concerned?

1781
02:32:21,170 --> 02:32:23,750
It's horrible
what she's done to you.

1782
02:32:23,774 --> 02:32:25,443
Pulled you into her mess.

1783
02:32:27,944 --> 02:32:29,313
A smart man?

1784
02:32:30,347 --> 02:32:33,359
He'd let her handle it.

1785
02:32:33,383 --> 02:32:36,895
Let things unfold
as they're meant to.

1786
02:32:36,919 --> 02:32:39,290
Why should you
pay her tab, Doc?

1787
02:32:41,024 --> 02:32:43,069
And for what?

1788
02:32:43,093 --> 02:32:46,939
For this little girl
who started all this trouble?

1789
02:32:46,963 --> 02:32:49,500
What would management
have me do about that?

1790
02:32:50,167 --> 02:32:52,311
Nothing.

1791
02:32:52,335 --> 02:32:55,248
Easiest thing in the world
to do, son.

1792
02:32:55,272 --> 02:32:57,449
Just bring her inside.

1793
02:32:57,473 --> 02:32:59,951
And then, well,

1794
02:32:59,975 --> 02:33:03,079
you accept the things
you cannot change.

1795
02:33:04,247 --> 02:33:05,391
<i>Dan!</i>

1796
02:33:05,415 --> 02:33:06,450
<i>She's here.</i>

1797
02:33:24,466 --> 02:33:25,935
Okay.

1798
02:33:40,383 --> 02:33:43,094
This place is sick.

1799
02:33:43,118 --> 02:33:45,464
Sick like my momo was sick.

1800
02:33:45,488 --> 02:33:47,099
It's cancer,

1801
02:33:47,123 --> 02:33:49,402
only worse.

1802
02:33:56,633 --> 02:33:58,210
What do we do now?

1803
02:33:58,234 --> 02:34:00,270
We head inside. She'll find us.

1804
02:35:50,246 --> 02:35:52,950
Well, well, well.

1805
02:35:54,451 --> 02:35:56,162
Hi there.

1806
02:35:56,186 --> 02:35:59,397
<i>When this starts, run.</i>

1807
02:35:59,421 --> 02:36:02,268
Yes, you run, dear.

1808
02:36:02,292 --> 02:36:04,636
And then I will find you

1809
02:36:04,660 --> 02:36:08,531
and you will scream for years
until you die.

1810
02:36:10,599 --> 02:36:13,244
We'll see
who does the screaming.

1811
02:36:13,268 --> 02:36:15,046
Oh, we'll see indeed.

1812
02:36:15,070 --> 02:36:17,048
She's right, you know.

1813
02:36:17,072 --> 02:36:18,541
You should be afraid.

1814
02:36:19,709 --> 02:36:22,120
Why is that?

1815
02:36:22,144 --> 02:36:24,724
Because you don't know
where you're standing.

1816
02:36:24,748 --> 02:36:26,984
I'm sorry, who are you,
handsome?

1817
02:36:31,286 --> 02:36:34,490
You're the one who killed
my Crow, aren't you?

1818
02:36:36,125 --> 02:36:37,126
Go.

1819
02:37:38,320 --> 02:37:40,599
Clever.

1820
02:37:40,623 --> 02:37:42,459
You've made some improvements,
haven't you?

1821
02:37:44,126 --> 02:37:46,638
Since the last time
I was in your mind.

1822
02:37:46,662 --> 02:37:48,464
<i>How do you know
we're not in yours?</i>

1823
02:38:03,246 --> 02:38:04,381
Where are you, pup?

1824
02:38:25,267 --> 02:38:26,736
You're gonna die here.

1825
02:38:27,704 --> 02:38:30,883
Mm. Brave words, dear.

1826
02:38:30,907 --> 02:38:32,576
Is that what you really think?

1827
02:38:33,343 --> 02:38:36,121
You're gonna hurt me?

1828
02:38:36,145 --> 02:38:37,388
Yes.

1829
02:38:43,720 --> 02:38:46,823
You know,
you remind me of myself.

1830
02:38:48,558 --> 02:38:51,136
I can really see it now.

1831
02:38:51,160 --> 02:38:53,538
You've got a darkness in you,
dear.

1832
02:38:53,562 --> 02:38:57,100
I think the only difference
between you and me is time.

1833
02:39:06,576 --> 02:39:08,178
You don't know yet...

1834
02:39:08,845 --> 02:39:10,247
what you'd do...

1835
02:39:11,180 --> 02:39:13,825
for more time.

1836
02:39:13,849 --> 02:39:17,354
But I promise you, dear,
oh, you'd be surprised.

1837
02:39:22,792 --> 02:39:24,695
Pain purifies steam.

1838
02:39:25,794 --> 02:39:29,665
Fear, too, so, you understand.

1839
02:39:49,518 --> 02:39:52,297
I was just like you
when I was younger.

1840
02:39:52,321 --> 02:39:53,689
I was special

1841
02:39:54,657 --> 02:39:56,701
and alone.

1842
02:39:56,725 --> 02:39:59,370
But I met someone who gave me the
gift of purpose, of community.

1843
02:39:59,394 --> 02:40:01,406
And I might have given you
such a gift

1844
02:40:01,430 --> 02:40:04,334
if things would
have gone differently.

1845
02:40:07,002 --> 02:40:09,280
No?

1846
02:40:09,304 --> 02:40:11,216
Defiant, aren't you?

1847
02:40:12,341 --> 02:40:13,751
So much like me.

1848
02:40:13,775 --> 02:40:16,779
Your mind is so...

1849
02:40:19,382 --> 02:40:21,385
This isn't your mind, is it?

1850
02:40:23,953 --> 02:40:25,689
This isn't you at all.

1851
02:40:27,924 --> 02:40:30,259
You're just the bait.

1852
02:40:33,730 --> 02:40:34,730
Enough!

1853
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:39,502
Run.

1854
02:40:41,704 --> 02:40:43,840
How the hell did we miss you?

1855
02:40:45,741 --> 02:40:46,985
Oh...

1856
02:40:47,009 --> 02:40:49,579
You and I should have met
years ago.

1857
02:40:53,049 --> 02:40:54,318
Danny.

1858
02:40:55,384 --> 02:40:59,297
That's your name, isn't it?

1859
02:40:59,321 --> 02:41:02,801
Well, something happens to the
steam when you rubes get older.

1860
02:41:02,825 --> 02:41:04,969
It gets polluted.

1861
02:41:04,993 --> 02:41:06,705
Dirty.

1862
02:41:06,729 --> 02:41:07,731
You know that.

1863
02:41:08,998 --> 02:41:11,777
I see the grease all over you.

1864
02:41:11,801 --> 02:41:14,779
You don't shine quite the same.

1865
02:41:14,803 --> 02:41:17,340
Growing up spoils that,
I guess.

1866
02:41:19,641 --> 02:41:21,587
Seriously, handsome,

1867
02:41:21,611 --> 02:41:24,313
where have you been hiding?

1868
02:41:27,317 --> 02:41:29,018
I can make you an offer.

1869
02:41:30,519 --> 02:41:32,364
An offer I rarely make.

1870
02:41:32,388 --> 02:41:34,832
Oh, yeah? I can't wait.

1871
02:41:34,856 --> 02:41:36,769
Such a gifted boy

1872
02:41:36,793 --> 02:41:40,638
hiding his light
under a bushel for so long.

1873
02:41:40,662 --> 02:41:45,044
You could live a long, long
time. Live well, too.

1874
02:41:45,068 --> 02:41:49,615
Indulge yourself,
no consequences,

1875
02:41:49,639 --> 02:41:51,275
no hangovers.

1876
02:41:52,874 --> 02:41:55,554
Eat well, live long.

1877
02:41:55,578 --> 02:41:58,556
You must be lonely,
being the last one.

1878
02:41:58,580 --> 02:42:00,725
I mean,
the last one in the world.

1879
02:42:00,749 --> 02:42:03,386
Sweetie, I'm not the last.
Far from it.

1880
02:42:04,620 --> 02:42:06,465
I'm just the prettiest.

1881
02:42:06,489 --> 02:42:08,525
I assume you know my answer.

1882
02:42:10,025 --> 02:42:11,369
Pity.

1883
02:42:11,393 --> 02:42:12,895
So, are we doing this or not?

1884
02:42:29,678 --> 02:42:31,457
Whew.

1885
02:42:33,649 --> 02:42:35,593
Oh, sweetie.

1886
02:42:35,617 --> 02:42:38,388
Oh, look at that, huh?

1887
02:42:39,588 --> 02:42:43,835
I seem to have nicked
your femoral artery there.

1888
02:42:43,859 --> 02:42:45,895
Why, you're gonna
bleed to death, huh?

1889
02:42:52,034 --> 02:42:54,480
My, my, what a temper you have.

1890
02:42:54,504 --> 02:42:56,013
So much fire.

1891
02:42:56,037 --> 02:42:57,815
Such a waste!

1892
02:42:57,839 --> 02:42:59,484
Or maybe not.

1893
02:43:06,615 --> 02:43:08,860
Oh, damn.

1894
02:43:08,884 --> 02:43:11,430
Even at your age...

1895
02:43:11,454 --> 02:43:12,956
it's so good.

1896
02:43:18,160 --> 02:43:19,995
You taste like whiskey.

1897
02:43:25,600 --> 02:43:26,703
Danny!

1898
02:43:27,737 --> 02:43:29,005
Danny boy!

1899
02:43:30,506 --> 02:43:32,617
Oh, so much terror.

1900
02:43:32,641 --> 02:43:34,519
All your life, huh?

1901
02:43:36,945 --> 02:43:38,547
Delicious.

1902
02:43:44,720 --> 02:43:46,656
Don't hurt me!

1903
02:43:48,624 --> 02:43:49,624
Oh, damn.

1904
02:43:53,963 --> 02:43:55,641
What are...
You're not alone in there.

1905
02:43:55,665 --> 02:43:57,876
Huh?

1906
02:43:57,900 --> 02:43:59,136
What are you hiding, huh?

1907
02:44:01,636 --> 02:44:03,147
What's in those?

1908
02:44:03,171 --> 02:44:04,716
Something special, huh?

1909
02:44:04,740 --> 02:44:08,545
They're not special.
They're starving.

1910
02:44:17,018 --> 02:44:18,697
No.

1911
02:44:18,721 --> 02:44:19,998
No!

1912
02:44:57,560 --> 02:44:59,571
Hello, Danny.

1913
02:45:01,597 --> 02:45:03,133
Come and play with us...

1914
02:45:04,934 --> 02:45:06,844
forever...

1915
02:45:06,868 --> 02:45:09,038
...and ever...

1916
02:45:10,572 --> 02:45:11,974
and ever.

1917
02:45:46,608 --> 02:45:47,877
Uncle Dan.

1918
02:45:48,910 --> 02:45:50,788
Uncle Dan, is it done?

1919
02:45:50,812 --> 02:45:52,915
Is she dead?

1920
02:46:14,903 --> 02:46:17,249
Great party, isn't it?

1921
02:46:17,273 --> 02:46:18,642
Abra!

1922
02:46:22,377 --> 02:46:23,613
Abra!

1923
02:46:40,161 --> 02:46:41,597
Abra!

1924
02:46:47,902 --> 02:46:49,639
Abra!

1925
02:47:07,956 --> 02:47:09,124
Try it.

1926
02:47:12,027 --> 02:47:13,805
Oh, there you are.

1927
02:47:13,829 --> 02:47:14,898
Abra.

1928
02:47:16,097 --> 02:47:18,843
You've been very, very bad.

1929
02:47:18,867 --> 02:47:21,012
You're not Uncle Dan.

1930
02:47:21,036 --> 02:47:23,907
You're a mask. A false face.

1931
02:47:25,306 --> 02:47:26,817
Who else would I be?

1932
02:47:26,841 --> 02:47:28,653
You're the hotel.

1933
02:47:28,677 --> 02:47:29,855
But he's still in there.

1934
02:47:29,879 --> 02:47:31,347
Mask is off, then.

1935
02:47:36,151 --> 02:47:38,196
Why are you smiling?

1936
02:47:38,220 --> 02:47:40,766
Because you don't know
where you're standing.

1937
02:47:40,790 --> 02:47:44,670
I know these halls
like my own face, child.

1938
02:47:44,694 --> 02:47:46,805
I mean the body
you're standing in.

1939
02:47:46,829 --> 02:47:48,773
The face you're wearing.

1940
02:47:48,797 --> 02:47:50,676
That's Dan Torrance,
and you don't know him.

1941
02:47:50,700 --> 02:47:52,310
Dan Torrance.

1942
02:47:52,334 --> 02:47:56,071
Dan Torrance made one stop
as soon as he got here.

1943
02:47:57,139 --> 02:47:58,775
To the boiler room.

1944
02:48:23,365 --> 02:48:25,802
There you are.

1945
02:48:27,135 --> 02:48:28,746
You were supposed to run.

1946
02:48:28,770 --> 02:48:30,448
I didn't wanna leave you.

1947
02:48:33,374 --> 02:48:35,245
I'm exactly
where I'm supposed to be.

1948
02:48:37,178 --> 02:48:39,924
I can't hold it off for much
longer. Abra, you need to run.

1949
02:48:39,948 --> 02:48:41,192
No.

1950
02:48:41,216 --> 02:48:42,828
I'm not going anywhere
without you.

1951
02:48:42,852 --> 02:48:45,187
I have to close the door
behind us, right?

1952
02:48:46,222 --> 02:48:47,898
Run! Run!

1953
02:51:02,258 --> 02:51:03,902
Come on, Uncle Dan.

1954
02:51:03,926 --> 02:51:05,061
Get out of there.

1955
02:51:06,495 --> 02:51:07,597
Come on.

1956
02:51:19,340 --> 02:51:21,619
<i>The fire spread fast,</i>

1957
02:51:21,643 --> 02:51:23,621
<i>destroying the hotel.</i>

1958
02:51:23,645 --> 02:51:25,214
<i>Purifying it.</i>

1959
02:51:26,649 --> 02:51:28,660
I could almost hear it...

1960
02:51:28,684 --> 02:51:29,684
screaming.

1961
02:51:31,186 --> 02:51:33,931
I could hear it dying.

1962
02:51:33,955 --> 02:51:36,491
And deep inside, I knew...

1963
02:51:39,361 --> 02:51:40,997
I knew you were okay.

1964
02:51:42,563 --> 02:51:44,434
I'm sorry I put you in danger.

1965
02:51:45,600 --> 02:51:47,002
It was the only way.

1966
02:51:48,070 --> 02:51:49,305
I know.

1967
02:51:50,406 --> 02:51:53,551
Do you think she was right

1968
02:51:53,575 --> 02:51:55,612
when she said
she wasn't the last one?

1969
02:51:56,979 --> 02:51:58,381
The world's a hungry place.

1970
02:51:59,248 --> 02:52:01,927
A dark place.

1971
02:52:01,951 --> 02:52:05,529
Maybe there's more of them
or things like them or worse,

1972
02:52:05,553 --> 02:52:07,389
but there are more people
like you, too.

1973
02:52:08,222 --> 02:52:09,959
People who stand.

1974
02:52:13,428 --> 02:52:15,306
I told you
when I first met you,

1975
02:52:15,330 --> 02:52:17,966
I told you that
you should hide.

1976
02:52:19,367 --> 02:52:21,371
That you should
keep your head down.

1977
02:52:22,471 --> 02:52:24,407
Keep your shine out of sight.

1978
02:52:26,474 --> 02:52:27,910
But I was wrong.

1979
02:52:31,145 --> 02:52:32,916
Shine on, Abra Stone.

1980
02:52:36,017 --> 02:52:38,262
You shine on.

1981
02:52:40,188 --> 02:52:42,124
Dinner's ready.

1982
02:52:45,259 --> 02:52:46,461
Who are you talking to?

1983
02:52:48,998 --> 02:52:50,441
No one.

1984
02:52:50,465 --> 02:52:51,567
Hmm.

1985
02:52:58,306 --> 02:52:59,542
That's not true.

1986
02:53:03,678 --> 02:53:05,180
I was talking to Dan.

1987
02:53:13,054 --> 02:53:15,190
We go on after.

1988
02:53:16,090 --> 02:53:17,769
We go on.

1989
02:53:17,793 --> 02:53:19,195
And he's okay.

1990
02:53:20,294 --> 02:53:21,496
So is Daddy.

1991
02:53:22,697 --> 02:53:24,166
He really is.

1992
02:53:28,169 --> 02:53:29,438
Good.

1993
02:53:41,050 --> 02:53:42,418
You coming, sweetheart?

1994
02:53:45,087 --> 02:53:46,530
In a minute.

1995
02:54:07,276 --> 02:54:12,276
